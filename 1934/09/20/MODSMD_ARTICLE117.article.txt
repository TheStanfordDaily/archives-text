# Lineup Saturday Includes Ten Lettermen; Wes Muller Injured
## FACE TOUGH SCHEDULE Indians Already Looking Toward Rose Bowl 
### MILLARD BROWNE 
Vows concerning U.S.C. must bo
uphold.
The Axe must be retained.
Stanford must get the Rose
; Bowl again.
These three notions are already
taking up much of the brain space
jof 80 candidates for a potentially
very good, and also very much
| written and spoken about, Stanford
I varsity football team.
And, although Coaches Claude E.
I "Tiny" Thornhill, Ernie Nevers, and
' Jim Lawson, are harboring the same
j ideas, they still come under the
: heading of mere dreams with the
| coaches.
Coaching Staff Busy
Of more immediate concern to the
; three directors of Stanford's IJM4
I gridiron destinies are the San Jose
I State game Saturday, the game will)
; Santa Clara next Saturday, the con
ditioning and polishing of what

should be a powerful squad, made
up mostly of veterans, the building
of reserve strength from last year's
freshman and gray teams together
with a few junior college transfers,
and quite a few other little points.
Thornhill will only attempt to get
: three teams ready for the San Jose
State clash, and ho probably will
run his first team during most of
! the game.
Three groups began last Saturday,
the opening day of practice, to run
| signals and try out plays; with minor
| changes they will be used against
j San Jose as they lined up in the
first workout.
Thornhill made several experi
mental alterations Monday, but
probably will return to his original
choice for the early games.
The first team is made up entirely
of lettermen, with the exception of
the center position. Alf Brandin, in
the early workouts lined up with
the first string.
Wes Muller, last year's regular at
the pivot work, did not arrive until
Monday shortly after noon. He went
out alone for a limbering up work
out, fell, and pulled some shoulder
ligaments. He will be out for two
weeks at least, physicians said.
Brandin Gets Call
Muller's absence definitely will
give the call to Brandin at least for
the next fortnight. The blond center
probably will press Muller consid
erably after the giant regular returns
to the line-up.
Lined up beside Brandin are Larry
Rouble and Woody Adams, the five
and-ten boys. At tackle, Bob Rey
nolds and Claude Callaway are as
sured of starting berths. Keith Top
ping will team with Monk Moscrip
in guarding the flanks.
Frank Alustiza will open at quar
terback, with Bones Hamilton doing
the blocking halfback work and
Buck Van Dellen appearing at the
other wing job. Bobby Grayson will
pilot the team from the fullback
position.
In the early workouts the second
squad lined up with Carlos Mon
salve and Alex Trompas at ends,
Ed Lettunich and Jack Drown
tackles, Jack Walton and Bob Black
guards, George Bergman center,
Earl Hoos quarterback, Chuck
White and Bob Maentz at halfbacks,
and Stan Anderson fullback.
Several Changes
Thornhill altered this team slightly
this week by placing Bob Mangan
and Carl Schott as toss-ups at left
and instead of Trompas. Ray Todd
and Anderson will alternate at full
back and quarterback, and White
and Gordon Head, a transfer from
San Mateo J. C., and Johnny Reisner
will interchange at the wingbacks.
The third team, which is due for
several changes later in the week,
appeared in the Saturday practice
with Jack Clark, outstanding Glen
dale J. C. transfer, and Mangan at
ends, Niels Larsen, from Menlo Jun
ior College, and Louis Tsoutsouvas
tackles, Rusty Maino and Bob Fow
ler guards, Ralph Quails center,
Chuck Ledbetter quarterback, Head
and Reisner halfbacks, and Todd
fullback.
During his experimenting Thorn
hill used a first team line-up Mon
day including Brandin, Black, Wal
ton, Moscrip, Clarke, Callaway,
Reynolds, Alustiza, Maentz, Van
Dellen, and Grayson. Topping alter
nated with the transfer, Clarke, in
this team.
All veterans who were expected
back reported for the first practice,
with the exception of Muller, Ben
Palamountain, and Shel Bronstein.
Palamountain, recovering from an
influenza attack, is expected at the
end of the week. He played tackle
early last year, was out most of the
season with a knee injury, and made
room for Reynolds and Callaway to
gain permanent work. This fall, he
may be shifted to end to compete
with Topping and Moscrip.
Bronstein attended practice in
civilian clothes Monday. He will

I not compete this year because of a
leg injury. He said the limb would
be operated on soon, and he hopes to
play during 1935. He is a junior with
i two years of competition remaining.
Maentz Hurts Leg
Bob Reynolds, huge tackle, was
troubled Monday with a slight in
fection of his toe, and he was out of
the afternoon workout. Another
casualty occurred when Bob Maentz,
halfback, injured a leg slight ly by
hitting the goal post. Both will be
ready for the San Jose contest.
There will be no team scrimmage
until after the San Jose game.
Thornhill said the team would be
too busy during the first week in
organizing plays. The linemen, how
ever, were grilled in blocking and
tackling fundamentals this week.
Scrimmage Tuesdays
All during the season scrimmage
, will be held on Tuesdays as a part
! of Thornhill's campaign to have the
j students know the football team. The
' student body will be invited to each
dress-up scrimmage.
The Indian coaching staff is wast
ing little worry on San Jose, but
j concentrating on Santa Clara.
The State Teachers have one of
I the best Far-Western Conference en
tries, and they claim three outstand
ing linemen and two stellar backs.
Captain Dario Simoni, a two-time
all-conference tackle, heads the list
|of linemen. Simoni, although fairly
j light for a front ranker, is a deadly
I tackier, as well as being a hard
! charger offensively.
Two Other Linemen
Karl Sandholdt and Jerry Whita
ker, guard and center, are two other
; San Jose veterans who help brace
j up a fairly strong line.
In the Spartan secondary, Dee
| Shehtanian is one of the speediest
quarterbacks of Northern California,
i In a broken field, he is always a
' threat. Another speedy back is
j Francis Pura, a find of last fall, who
| developed into one of the confer
i ence's chief open field performers.
Jay Todd, recent graduate from the
Cardinal gridiron ranks, was ap
j pointed to a position on the San
1 Jose coaching staff, which is headed
:by Dud DeGroot, former Indian
captain.

may be shifted to end to compete
with Topping and Moscrip.
Bronstein attended practice in
civilian clothes Monday. He will

I not compete this year because of a
leg injury. He said the limb would
be operated on soon, and he hopes to
play during 1935. He is a junior with
i two years of competition remaining.
Maentz Hurts Leg
Bob Reynolds, huge tackle, was
troubled Monday with a slight in
fection of his toe, and he was out of
the afternoon workout. Another
casualty occurred when Bob Maentz,
halfback, injured a leg slight ly by
hitting the goal post. Both will be
ready for the San Jose contest.
There will be no team scrimmage
until after the San Jose game.
Thornhill said the team would be
too busy during the first week in
organizing plays. The linemen, how
ever, were grilled in blocking and
tackling fundamentals this week.
Scrimmage Tuesdays
All during the season scrimmage
, will be held on Tuesdays as a part
! of Thornhill's campaign to have the
j students know the football team. The
' student body will be invited to each
dress-up scrimmage.
The Indian coaching staff is wast
ing little worry on San Jose, but
j concentrating on Santa Clara.
The State Teachers have one of
I the best Far-Western Conference en
tries, and they claim three outstand
ing linemen and two stellar backs.
Captain Dario Simoni, a two-time
all-conference tackle, heads the list
|of linemen. Simoni, although fairly
j light for a front ranker, is a deadly
I tackier, as well as being a hard
! charger offensively.
Two Other Linemen
Karl Sandholdt and Jerry Whita
ker, guard and center, are two other
; San Jose veterans who help brace
j up a fairly strong line.
In the Spartan secondary, Dee
| Shehtanian is one of the speediest
quarterbacks of Northern California,
i In a broken field, he is always a
' threat. Another speedy back is
j Francis Pura, a find of last fall, who
| developed into one of the confer
i ence's chief open field performers.
Jay Todd, recent graduate from the
Cardinal gridiron ranks, was ap
j pointed to a position on the San

Vows concerning U.S.C. must bo

very good, and also very much

I varsity football team.
And, although Coaches Claude E.

Coaching Staff Busy
Of more immediate concern to the
; three directors of Stanford's IJM4
I gridiron destinies are the San Jose
I State game Saturday, the game will)
; Santa Clara next Saturday, the con
ditioning and polishing of what

should be a powerful squad, made
up mostly of veterans, the building
of reserve strength from last year's
freshman and gray teams together
with a few junior college transfers,
and quite a few other little points.
Thornhill will only attempt to get
: three teams ready for the San Jose
State clash, and ho probably will
run his first team during most of
! the game.
Three groups began last Saturday,
the opening day of practice, to run
| signals and try out plays; with minor
| changes they will be used against
j San Jose as they lined up in the
first workout.
Thornhill made several experi
mental alterations Monday, but
probably will return to his original
choice for the early games.
The first team is made up entirely
of lettermen, with the exception of
the center position. Alf Brandin, in
the early workouts lined up with
the first string.
Wes Muller, last year's regular at
the pivot work, did not arrive until
Monday shortly after noon. He went
out alone for a limbering up work
out, fell, and pulled some shoulder
ligaments. He will be out for two
weeks at least, physicians said.
Brandin Gets Call
Muller's absence definitely will
give the call to Brandin at least for
the next fortnight. The blond center
probably will press Muller consid
erably after the giant regular returns
to the line-up.
Lined up beside Brandin are Larry
Rouble and Woody Adams, the five
and-ten boys. At tackle, Bob Rey
nolds and Claude Callaway are as
sured of starting berths. Keith Top
ping will team with Monk Moscrip
in guarding the flanks.
Frank Alustiza will open at quar
terback, with Bones Hamilton doing
the blocking halfback work and
Buck Van Dellen appearing at the
other wing job. Bobby Grayson will
pilot the team from the fullback
position.
In the early workouts the second
squad lined up with Carlos Mon
salve and Alex Trompas at ends,
Ed Lettunich and Jack Drown
tackles, Jack Walton and Bob Black
guards, George Bergman center,
Earl Hoos quarterback, Chuck
White and Bob Maentz at halfbacks,
and Stan Anderson fullback.
Several Changes
Thornhill altered this team slightly
this week by placing Bob Mangan
and Carl Schott as toss-ups at left
and instead of Trompas. Ray Todd
and Anderson will alternate at full
back and quarterback, and White
and Gordon Head, a transfer from
San Mateo J. C., and Johnny Reisner
will interchange at the wingbacks.
The third team, which is due for
several changes later in the week,
appeared in the Saturday practice
with Jack Clark, outstanding Glen
dale J. C. transfer, and Mangan at
ends, Niels Larsen, from Menlo Jun
ior College, and Louis Tsoutsouvas
tackles, Rusty Maino and Bob Fow
ler guards, Ralph Quails center,
Chuck Ledbetter quarterback, Head
and Reisner halfbacks, and Todd
fullback.
During his experimenting Thorn
hill used a first team line-up Mon
day including Brandin, Black, Wal
ton, Moscrip, Clarke, Callaway,
Reynolds, Alustiza, Maentz, Van
Dellen, and Grayson. Topping alter
nated with the transfer, Clarke, in
this team.
All veterans who were expected
back reported for the first practice,
with the exception of Muller, Ben
Palamountain, and Shel Bronstein.
Palamountain, recovering from an
influenza attack, is expected at the
end of the week. He played tackle
early last year, was out most of the
season with a knee injury, and made
room for Reynolds and Callaway to
gain permanent work. This fall, he
may be shifted to end to compete
with Topping and Moscrip.

Lined up beside Brandin are Larry
Rouble and Woody Adams, the five
and-ten boys. At tackle, Bob Rey
nolds and Claude Callaway are as
sured of starting berths. Keith Top
ping will team with Monk Moscrip
in guarding the flanks.
Frank Alustiza will open at quar
terback, with Bones Hamilton doing
the blocking halfback work and
Buck Van Dellen appearing at the
other wing job. Bobby Grayson will
pilot the team from the fullback
position.
In the early workouts the second
squad lined up with Carlos Mon
salve and Alex Trompas at ends,
Ed Lettunich and Jack Drown
tackles, Jack Walton and Bob Black
guards, George Bergman center,
Earl Hoos quarterback, Chuck
White and Bob Maentz at halfbacks,
and Stan Anderson fullback.
Several Changes
Thornhill altered this team slightly
this week by placing Bob Mangan
and Carl Schott as toss-ups at left
and instead of Trompas. Ray Todd
and Anderson will alternate at full
back and quarterback, and White
and Gordon Head, a transfer from
San Mateo J. C., and Johnny Reisner
will interchange at the wingbacks.
The third team, which is due for
several changes later in the week,
appeared in the Saturday practice
with Jack Clark, outstanding Glen
dale J. C. transfer, and Mangan at
ends, Niels Larsen, from Menlo Jun
ior College, and Louis Tsoutsouvas
tackles, Rusty Maino and Bob Fow
ler guards, Ralph Quails center,
Chuck Ledbetter quarterback, Head
and Reisner halfbacks, and Todd
fullback.
During his experimenting Thorn
hill used a first team line-up Mon
day including Brandin, Black, Wal
ton, Moscrip, Clarke, Callaway,
Reynolds, Alustiza, Maentz, Van
Dellen, and Grayson. Topping alter
nated with the transfer, Clarke, in
this team.
All veterans who were expected
back reported for the first practice,
with the exception of Muller, Ben
Palamountain, and Shel Bronstein.
Palamountain, recovering from an
influenza attack, is expected at the
end of the week. He played tackle
early last year, was out most of the
season with a knee injury, and made
room for Reynolds and Callaway to
gain permanent work. This fall, he
may be shifted to end to compete
with Topping and Moscrip.
Bronstein attended practice in
civilian clothes Monday. He will

I not compete this year because of a
leg injury. He said the limb would
be operated on soon, and he hopes to
play during 1935. He is a junior with
i two years of competition remaining.
Maentz Hurts Leg
Bob Reynolds, huge tackle, was
troubled Monday with a slight in
fection of his toe, and he was out of
the afternoon workout. Another
casualty occurred when Bob Maentz,
halfback, injured a leg slight ly by
hitting the goal post. Both will be
ready for the San Jose contest.
There will be no team scrimmage
until after the San Jose game.
Thornhill said the team would be
too busy during the first week in
organizing plays. The linemen, how
ever, were grilled in blocking and
tackling fundamentals this week.
Scrimmage Tuesdays
All during the season scrimmage
, will be held on Tuesdays as a part
! of Thornhill's campaign to have the
j students know the football team. The
' student body will be invited to each
dress-up scrimmage.
The Indian coaching staff is wast
ing little worry on San Jose, but
j concentrating on Santa Clara.
The State Teachers have one of
I the best Far-Western Conference en
tries, and they claim three outstand
ing linemen and two stellar backs.
Captain Dario Simoni, a two-time
all-conference tackle, heads the list
|of linemen. Simoni, although fairly
j light for a front ranker, is a deadly
I tackier, as well as being a hard
! charger offensively.
Two Other Linemen
Karl Sandholdt and Jerry Whita
ker, guard and center, are two other
; San Jose veterans who help brace
j up a fairly strong line.
In the Spartan secondary, Dee
| Shehtanian is one of the speediest
quarterbacks of Northern California,
i In a broken field, he is always a
' threat. Another speedy back is
j Francis Pura, a find of last fall, who
| developed into one of the confer
i ence's chief open field performers.
Jay Todd, recent graduate from the
Cardinal gridiron ranks, was ap
j pointed to a position on the San
1 Jose coaching staff, which is headed
:by Dud DeGroot, former Indian
captain.
Vows concerning U.S.C. must bo
uphold.
The Axe must be retained.
Stanford must get the Rose
; Bowl again.
These three notions are already
taking up much of the brain space
jof 80 candidates for a potentially
very good, and also very much
| written and spoken about, Stanford
I varsity football team.
And, although Coaches Claude E.
I "Tiny" Thornhill, Ernie Nevers, and
' Jim Lawson, are harboring the same
j ideas, they still come under the
: heading of mere dreams with the
| coaches.
Coaching Staff Busy
Of more immediate concern to the
; three directors of Stanford's IJM4
I gridiron destinies are the San Jose
I State game Saturday, the game will)
; Santa Clara next Saturday, the con
ditioning and polishing of what

should be a powerful squad, made
up mostly of veterans, the building
of reserve strength from last year's
freshman and gray teams together
with a few junior college transfers,
and quite a few other little points.
Thornhill will only attempt to get
: three teams ready for the San Jose
State clash, and ho probably will
run his first team during most of
! the game.
Three groups began last Saturday,
the opening day of practice, to run
| signals and try out plays; with minor
| changes they will be used against
j San Jose as they lined up in the
first workout.
Thornhill made several experi
mental alterations Monday, but
probably will return to his original
choice for the early games.
The first team is made up entirely
of lettermen, with the exception of
the center position. Alf Brandin, in
the early workouts lined up with
the first string.
Wes Muller, last year's regular at
the pivot work, did not arrive until
Monday shortly after noon. He went
out alone for a limbering up work
out, fell, and pulled some shoulder
ligaments. He will be out for two
weeks at least, physicians said.
Brandin Gets Call
Muller's absence definitely will
give the call to Brandin at least for
the next fortnight. The blond center
probably will press Muller consid
erably after the giant regular returns
to the line-up.
