INDIANS FACE
NEW SITUATION
It's a different story this year.
Last fall Stanford was beginning
football practice about this time with
an untried group of sophomores as
a nucleus, with a new coaching staff,
and with a reputation to make rather
than protect.
It's a different story this year.
The group of sophomores proved
itself, to the extent of coming
Ihrough the season with but one de
feat, and with a victory over both
California and Southern California
in the same series of games.
The coaches proved themselves,
and they gained a lot of faith from
students and alumni, and compli
ments from outsiders.
THEY'D ALL LIKE
TO BEAT STANFORD
All of this makes Stanford the
team to point for. And some ten
teams on the Cardinal program will
be doing just this. Entirely on a
basis of early season dope, all the
sports writers are picking the Indians
us a shade favored over other coast
conference contenders.
They all talk about the speedy
California transfers, the "all-Mid-
Western backfield" at Washington,
the breakaway speed at St. Mary's,
the power of Santa Clara, the mys
terious knack at U.S.C. of always
turning out a good team, and par
ticularly a good line.
BUT CARDS ARE
STILL FAVORED
All of this the newspapers claim,
and it is all quite true, but never
theless they rate Stanford as the
favorite. And one of the big reasons
for this is that Coach Tiny Thorn
hill's Cards came through with a
co-championship in 1933.
For the past few years, it has
been Southern California. Stanford
had a habit of pointing a season's
attack at El Trojan. California had
that same little habit. So did Wash
ington, Notre Dame, St. Mary's and
a few others. U.S.C. had nothing left
to do but take each as it came. It
usually succeeded in taking Stanford
right in stride.
THE POSITION
IS REVERSED
Now it's just the opposite. Just be
cause a group of cocky freshmen
swore two years ago they would
never bow to Troy and just because
they succeeded in maintaining this
vow for one year besides winning
from nearly everyone else, that group
is now on the "spot.
This year it is Stanford that must
take everything in stride. The Tro
jans began practice last week, and
although they will take time of
on various Saturdays beforehand,
Mister Howard Jones will have one
continuous picture of the Stanford
game before his players from now
until October 27.
BEARS. WILDCATS
ALSO HUNGRY
That, then, will give the Indians a
busy afternoon late in October. But
Ihat will be just two weeks after
another awfully busy occasion, and
just a month before possibly the most
troublesome one of all.
Northwestern, more fortunate
against the boys from the Farm in
1933 than either El Trojan or the
Golden Bear, succeeded in tying a
favored Card squad in Chicago last
October. They want to do it, or
better, again. The Wildcats will do
a little pointing of their own. And
so it will go all year.
SAN JOSE STATE
WON'T BE SO BAD
The first game of the season,
scheduled for Saturday afternoon
with San Jose State, probably will
not furnish as many worries as the
other nine. But naturally every
small school is out to beat a large
one if possible, and particularly if
that larger school happens to be a
eo-champion of a major conference.
Says San Jose, there would be
nothing quite like reading in the
papers a headline something liko
"Stanford Upset by State Teachers.''
All of that would kind of build a
little prestige for the little-talked-of
Spartans.
BRONCS WILL BE
TOUGH THIS EARLY
Next week will find the Santa
Clara Broncos with murder or some
thing similar in their hearts. And
Clipper Smith's group will be tough.
They would be tough any time, but
particularly they will be tough this
early in the program. Football prac
tice doesn't start for any of the more

I important teams until September 15.
! But when classes take up early in
i August, some of the boys that hap-
I pen to play football have a habit of
! getting together for a bit of mild
I exercise. •
Si'.nta Clara was a hard nut to
i crack last year. It was finally done
by a 7-0 count, but the game could
just as well have gone either way.
! This season's Santa Clara squad is
the same that v/as mentioned above
in this column as being claimed
! powerful by some of the newspaper
! authorities.
OREGON STATE—
| TIIE ELEVEN IKON MEN
As soon as Santa Clara is in the
background, Stanford will get ready
for a trip to Portland to meet the
Oregon Slate iron men, the same
that held Southern California to a
i totaily scoreless tie last year.
And it looks like rain in Portland.
Wet weather is always possible and
: frequently in the Northwest. It may
; be recalled Stanford didn't do so
well during their two damp games
. last fall. One was with Washington,
i the other with Columbia. The moral
I is obvious.
| NORTHWESTERN,
i THEN U.S.F.
The already mentioned Northwest -
: ern Wildcats come to the Coast on
| the following week. The Evanston,
111., squad is habitually among the
j top notchers in the Big Ten, as good
as any football league in the country.
The University of San Francisco
Dons, scheduled in 1933 as a breather,
entertain Stanford at Kezar Stadium
| on the following Saturday. Last fall's
breather did furnish an easy breath,
but that breath came after the game
was all over, not before. The final
1 score was 20-13 in favor of the Card
| inals, but the San Francisco team
I succeeded in maintaining a lead until
■ well into the fourth quarter.
S.C. MAY FURNISH
BEST HOME GAME
The Trojan game has already been
mentioned, and it probably will con
-1 tinue to be mentioned until long
| after it is over. Right now it looks
like about a toss-up. At any rate it
i wiil be a real treat for fans, and,
: everything considered, it should be
1 the outstanding home game of the
j Indian schedule.
U.C.L.A., the baby sister of the
conference, has grown up and may
slap some of the big brothers' faces
this year. The Bruin wouldn't care
i if it was Stanford. The two tangle in
1 Olympic Stadium at Los Angeles one
; week after the Cardinal - Trojan
| battle. A week may give Thornhill's
squad a chance to recover from the
ravages of the Jones boys—but again
it may not. And even if the Cards
I are fully recovered and ready to go,
| Ucla is not to be taken lightly.
WASHINGTON CASTS
j ITS SPELL NEXT
I Stanford might win every game
all year, and for no reason at all
fall before Washington. This year
there will be reasons, if the Seattle
aggregation should continue to hold
1 its jinx over the Farm. For four
years Stanford has saved the poor
fluskie from complete oblivion in
the gridiron horizon. Last year the
Cards blamed wet weather, the year
before it was a case of no one knows
what, and the year before that rain
; was again credited with a Washing
ion victory.
But this year there will be no
alibis. The reason is that Washing
| ton will be good, and if they win
j again, that will be why.
O.C. PROBABLY
WILL EE EASY
Between the Washington and Cali
fornia contests, the San Francisco
'Olympic Club will entertain what
by then probably will be a tired
| Redskin eleven.
The Winged-0 clash looks at this
1 early date as if it should be almost
i set-up. But the San Franciscans
1 are made up of a group of expe
j rienced players which with as much
' practice as the other teams get dur
■ ing the year would be hard to beat.
They usually do not take the game
quite as seriously as the collegians,
| but their experience invariably gives
Stanford a good work-out.
CALIFORNIA BEARS
WILL I>E BETTER
Who's got the Axe? The question
now is, who will have it after the
Big Game? It's a good bet which
j ever way one answers it.
Early last fall it was predicted
| that Stanford and California, each
I with a powerful group of sopho

mores, would be among the first
four or five last year, but that each
would be really good during the next
year. It so happened that Stanford's
sophomores came along a bit faster
than did California's. But that means
nothing for this year. The Bears will
be experienced by that time, and with
a bit more speed, which they prob
ably will get by shifts in the line
up this year, they almost surely will
enter the Big Game on a par basis
with Stanford.
All of this can be summed up by
the writer's prediction that Stanford
will not come through her schedule
completely unscathed. Any one of
eight, and possibly even ten, op
ponents could easily topple the
Indians from their high position.
Furthermore, as long as predic
tions cost nothing, the writer also
believes Stanford will again defeat
both California and U.S.C. Reasons
will come later in the season.
