# TRACK TEAM LOSES MATERIAL THROUGH 1934 GRADUATION
## 
### 
Track—the most successrul major
sport on the campus last year irom
a national victory standpoint—was
harder hit than any other athletic
activity by graduation, and Coaches
Dink Templeton and Bill Ellington
arc already a bit puzzled as to what
they are going to use for material to
defend their laurels.
Of the Stanford seven, and then
the Stanford eight, who captured the
I. C. 4-A contest in Philadelphia and
then came back to the Coast to
collect first place in the N.C.A.A.
meet, four have been graduated.
Lyman, Dunn Gone
Activities on the Farm for Johnny
Lyman, Gordon Dunn, Jimmy Will
son and Bud Deacon have come to a
c: lose.
However, the other four, A1 Black
man, Johnny Mottram, Chuck Nim
mo and Sam Klopstock will be back
to again try for the N.C.A.A. title.
Because of a Board of Athletic Con
trol decision last spring, the Cardi
nals will not defend their 1.C.-A.
honors.
Joining this staff of seasoned na
tional competitors will be a strong
: quad of 1934 freshmen, together
wilii several outstanding junior col
lege transfers.
Frosh Advancc
Among the yearlings,will be Cap
tain Rusty March, who will join
Nimtno in the distances. Fred Wil
liams and Chuck Voigt show prom
ise of being good varsity material in
the sprints. Williams also will un
derstudy Mottram in the javelin.
A high who will bear
watching is Humbert Smith, who
started out slowJy last year but
finally reached G feet 3 inches fairly
consistently, and showed good form
and prospects of going higher.
,Yearling Weight Men
Jim Reynolds, together with Ralph
Bergman, Chuck Ledbetter, and Jack
Walton, will bid fair to replace Dunn
and Lyman in the weights. The
broad jump at present looks like the
weak event.
To fill in at the middle distances,
Dixon, a San Mateo J. C. transfer,
will be on hand. A team-mate of
Dix:>n's Ray Dean, made an out
standing junior college record as a
sprinter, lie has also signified his
intention of registering on the Farm
this year.
Lines up Frosh
Freshman Coach Ellington has al
ready lined up several outstanding
high school stars among the list of
frosh entrants. He looks for strength
in the distances and jumps par
ticularly.
Track practice will be held every
day during fall quarter. Templeton
will work his men for an hour a day,
and probably will hold regular prac
tice meels among squad members
every Friday after the workouts are
well under way.
