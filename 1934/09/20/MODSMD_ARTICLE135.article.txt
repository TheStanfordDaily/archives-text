# Tuesday To Be Student Day On Practice Field
## 
### 
Every Tuesday will be a student
day on the Stanford football prac
tice field.
Coach Tiny Thorfihill this week
announced he plans to continue the
policy inaugurated last year of letting
the student body get acquainted with
the varsity. On every Tuesday when
it is convenient, Thornhill said, the
squad will hold a "dress-up" scrim
for lli" benefit of the students.
Brief rallies probably will ac
company the turnout at the student
day practices.
