Don Cossacks Sing
The Don Cossacks, who will open

existence, being composed of 36 ex
officers of the Czar's Imperial Army.
Their concerts are made up of Rus
sian sacred music, folk songs, and
Cossack war songs accompanied by
shouts, whistling ,and frenzied danc
ing.
For the first time this season three
musical organizations of the Stanford
campus will appear together in a
concert displaying the vocal and in
strumental abilities of over 200 stu
dents. This performance is the result
of a growing demand for increased
Stanford musical actvities and a
greater field for music.
Stravinsky Performs
The most significant figure among
all composers of this age and boast
ing the most impressive name in con
temporary music is Igor Stravinsky,
who appears on the campus February
14. He is the composer of "Petrou
ska," "L'Oiseau de Feu" (The Fire-
Bird Suite), "Le Sacre du Prin
temps" (The Rites of Spring), and
other symphonic music of great dis
tinction. He is the most provocative
musician to come to America in
many seasons. With Stravinsky will
come Samuel Dushkin, noted violin
ist, and their joint program is ex
pected to make musical history at
Stanford University.
Considered "the miracle child of
the world," nine-year-old Ruth
Slenczynski has startled the musical
world with the power and maturity
of her piano renditions. March 5 she
will play for the Stanford audience.
Russian Scheduled
Critics agree that Caruso and
Melba were the two unsurpassed
voices of the past fifty years. One
of the two really great voices of
the present half century will he
heard April 4 when the six-foot-fout-
Russian basso, Feodor Chaliapin,
visits Stanford.
He has won world-wide fame in
opera as well as on the concert stage
and is noted not only for the power
and tonal quality of his deep bass
voice but also for his many imper
sonations that are as dramatically
vivid as they are musically perfect.
