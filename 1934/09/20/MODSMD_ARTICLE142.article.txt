# California Daily Says Bill Ingram Is On Spot
## 
### 
An early season editorial in the
Daily Californian made some pointed
jabs at Navy Bill Ingram, Bear foot
ball coach, to the effect that the grid
head is "on the spot" and knows it.
Among other things the editorial
said, "This year is the year that will
definitely shove his "New Deal" up
or. down."
It went on with a paragraph of
praise and then broke into three
statements: That Ingram "arrived at
a time when 'debunking de pigskin'
was a popular pastime." That "not
over-friendly sports authorities have
gotten even students into the notion
that Mr. Ingram approves of juggling
football schedules so as to arrange a
sure-fire 'breather schedule.' "That
stories concerning Ingram's activities
in the San Francisco waterfront
strike had been spread maliciously.
The editorial finished with, "And
at last it looks as though the Bear
will be in Pasadena on New Year's
dayâ€”and not as a spectator, either."
