# BASEBALL HOPES BETTER FUR '35
## 
### 
After a mediocre season that
1 blossomed forth only often enough
j last year to show potentialities,
Coach Harry Wolter is already
; anxiously awaiting next spring's
! baseball opener to see if this scat
i tered power may show some con
j sistency.
One of the departments that gave
i Wolter considerable worry during
i the spring was an untried pitching
staff. Next year the Indians will
I start out with four, instead of one,
! experienced pitchers of proven abil
! ity.
Stan Anderson will be back to
i head the pitching staff. Although
Anderson ma}' not have been
credited with many victories in the
; league records, he turned in several
I afternoons of chucking which would
I have won most ball games, but
which went to opponents because of
jan absence of support. Fred Her
! inger, Johnny Campbell, and Bob
; Semmelroth, with valuable experi
j ence gained last year, will also be
j back for service.
With the exception of Jerry Traut
man at third, the entire first string
j will be back next spring. Gordy
i Mallatratt at first, and Eddie Gal
j braith and Frank Tremaine, two
i sophs who took care of second end
| short, will be back with considerable
| experience. In addition, Wolter will
; have three olher infielders who
i played part of last season, Ed Clarke,
; Jirn Woolley, and Bob Grayson,
j For outfielders there will be Bob
Hamilton and Jim Moscript; Mort
I Nutting may return.
