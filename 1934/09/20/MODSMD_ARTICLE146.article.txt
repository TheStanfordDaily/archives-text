# WATER POLO WILL BE COMPLETED IN AUTUMN QUARTER
## 
### 
Wilh a new arrangement of the
aquatic program- this year, Coach j
Nort Thornton is getting Encina j
Pools in shape to begin immediately
after school opens to build a water <
polo team.
This year the entire schedule of
water polo games will be completed 1
in the fall quarter, leaving the re- '
mainder of the year for Thornton j
and his men to devote to swimming,
In the past, half of the Northern
California Water Polo League has i
been run off in the autumn and the |
other half in the spring.
Conference Organized
Besides meeting the league mem- I
bers this season, the Indians will
play double headers with U.C.L.A.
and U.S.C. in the newly organized i
coast conference. Stanford and Cal- .
ifornia are already scheduled to,
tangle twice in the Northern Cal
ifornia circuit.
The four conference water polo |
squads will travel with the football
teams this year. Stanford and Cal- !
ifornia each meet the Bruins in the |
North on the week-end of October
20, when the Bear and Ucla grid
teams clash at Berkeley. U.S.C. will j
send a water polo squad north on the ;
week of October 27, which will play :
Stanford here on the morning of the j
Indian-Trojan football classic. The'
Card mermen will go south for re- j
turn games with U.C.L.A. and U.S.C.
when the Indians meet the Bruins |
on the football field November 3. j
Thornton Optimistic
Coach Thornton has been working I
during the summer with several of j
the Stanford players, and he is quite
optimistic in his outlook.
Among the more favorable shifts I
lie has been considering is the chang- j
ing of Captain Leo Cook from goalie I
to forward. The former goal tender j
in his new position would play a j
waiting game and the remainder of i
the team would feed the ball to him
"in the hole" for set up shots. He j
has been showing surprising agility i
at this work.
With a squad of experienced play- '
ers expected to report during the
week of registration, Thornton in
tends to start immediately building
his offense. Should he change Cook's
position as considei'ed, Thornton in
dicated he may change from a
Hungarian to an American system
of play. That is,- he will alter the
short, quick throws of his present
offense and install more of a long
game. j

in his new position would play a j
waiting game and the remainder of i
the team would feed the ball to him
"in the hole" for set up shots. He j
has been showing surprising agility i
at this work.
With a squad of experienced play- '
ers expected to report during the
week of registration, Thornton in
tends to start immediately building
his offense. Should he change Cook's
position as considei'ed, Thornton in
dicated he may change from a
Hungarian to an American system
of play. That is,- he will alter the
short, quick throws of his present
offense and install more of a long
game. j
Wilh a new arrangement of the
aquatic program- this year, Coach j
Nort Thornton is getting Encina j
Pools in shape to begin immediately
after school opens to build a water <
polo team.
This year the entire schedule of
water polo games will be completed 1
in the fall quarter, leaving the re- '
mainder of the year for Thornton j
and his men to devote to swimming,
In the past, half of the Northern
California Water Polo League has i
been run off in the autumn and the |
other half in the spring.
Conference Organized
Besides meeting the league mem- I
bers this season, the Indians will
play double headers with U.C.L.A.
and U.S.C. in the newly organized i
coast conference. Stanford and Cal- .
ifornia are already scheduled to,
tangle twice in the Northern Cal
ifornia circuit.
The four conference water polo |
squads will travel with the football
teams this year. Stanford and Cal- !
ifornia each meet the Bruins in the |
North on the week-end of October
20, when the Bear and Ucla grid

Card mermen will go south for re- j
turn games with U.C.L.A. and U.S.C.
when the Indians meet the Bruins |
on the football field November 3. j
Thornton Optimistic
Coach Thornton has been working I
during the summer with several of j
the Stanford players, and he is quite
optimistic in his outlook.
Among the more favorable shifts I
lie has been considering is the chang- j
ing of Captain Leo Cook from goalie I
to forward. The former goal tender j
in his new position would play a j
waiting game and the remainder of i
the team would feed the ball to him
"in the hole" for set up shots. He j
has been showing surprising agility i
at this work.
