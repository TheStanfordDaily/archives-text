People will tell you that you are going
"back to the Farm," and you will learn, il you
are new to Stanford, that Stanford is the
Farm. W hen Senator Stanford first purchased
the some 7,0(111 acres in the fertile Santa Clara
Valley, it was then known as the "Palo Alto
Dairy Farm." Few ol the cows and such of
IJSIMI would recognize flic Farm today.
Now, because you are part of Stanford, you
are coining home to the Farm. S\ hether you
be of agrarian tastes makes little difference.
In a sense, you shall be more or less akin to
the masses who live with the aid ol the rich
black earth that constitutes a Farm in any
man's country.
Stanford's academic faculty, noted here and
abroad for ability and achievement, are per
haps the farmers who are on the job to see
that we all produce the goods on demand.
They are the Jhain Huskers, and :is such will
segregate the good from the bad and mould
the men and women who will represent Stan
lord in the field of progress tomorrow.
Stanford lias been spoken of as being very
choosy in the type of student admitted to
study on the Quad. True. But that shouldn't
fool anyone into believing that, because he is
at Stanford, he can rest on past laurels. The
beginning is .just in sight, and there is work
to be done.
So, on the Farm, being near the soil, one is
democratic in form if not in the conventional
jackass style. "Hello" is the byword, and
everybody on the campus, friend or stranger,
says "hello" in passing, day or night.
Opinions are not formed overnight, one
finds many friends and new situations to meet.
A friendly campus, willing faculty and fellow
students, and plenty of California sunshine
are vours to do with as von like.
