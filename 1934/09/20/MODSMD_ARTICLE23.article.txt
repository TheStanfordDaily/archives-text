# Life begins At Stanford
## 
### 
About I ho only brand of industry (i.e. —
College students arc industrious) that the New
Dealers of 1934 haven't eraeked down on as
yet, wHh iron-elad rules and regulations
enough to make life just a little bit more
routine and possibly a bit less exciting, is that
unit of American society wherein lie the col
leges and universities of the country.
Today you may not he able to go out and
j aire base a brand new widget on your own
terms (or those of the local dealer). You
might not be permitted to sell the gadgets
made in your own back yard at the price
you and your clientele believe the most logical.
But—you are still able to "go to college" and,
at Stanford, to be pretty much on vour own.
So, in you Stanford has a new friend—and
you will find a new though temporary home.
There are no "codes" here except that of a
gentleman. You will not cheat, seholastically
or otherwise.
You are permitted to earn ;is much money
as necessity and opportunity will permit, and
no turbulent task-master will stop you from
working as much as you want. There won't
be a soul to limit the number of times you
attend classes during the day, and professors
will not spank anyone it hi' fails to show up
in the morning. Examinations will tell the
s:ul tale, rather than any mixture of pseudo
alphabetical soup-10-nuls.
In other words, you arrive on the Farm
very much your own Moss. II you want ad
vice, there are many who are in a position to
lill the bill very well. Stanford maintains a
student employment bureau and ;i vocational
guidance ofliee. Moth Deans are glad to lend
a hand it the going is hard, so don't ever be
bashful about seeking advice. Merely con
sider it carefully when it is to be had, and
separate the good and the bad. There are
many who will tell you "Ihe best thing to do"
during the next few weeks. When you really
want to know, ask those who are here for
that purpose.
If you come to Stanford to play around, to
see a llashy varsity in action, to indulge in a
lew good drinks, perhaps a round of Ihe
"places to see" in the Hay Hegion, and, inci
dentally to study, it would serve you better
not to lay .$1 I I on Ihe line October I.
liul if you come to learn, to see yourself
mature rapidly in Ihe nexl lew years, to make
yourself a part of Stanford and her athletic
and extracurricular life, studying hard the
while, you will enjoy the Farm, and Ihe ad
vantage to Ihe institution and the individual
will be mutual. II is a vibrant game of give
and lake, Ihough il is often discouraging when
Ihe rewards fail to come swarming in at Ihe
outset'.
II is advantageous for a newcomer lo ar

rive on the campus at least a IV'\v days hel'ore
registration day, October 1. Important deci
sions, those that will guide the next four
years, are to he made. Figure out today, lor
yourself, and with the advice of those who
can aid you, how much lime you will have for
extracuricular activities, what your own fi
nancial setup calis for in the way of part-time
employment, and what your favorite activities
are going to he.
It's 100 had sometimes, hid one person can't
find time to do everything. And, hy necessity,
we must choose.
We choose well, decide carefully, and we
slick to it. J .ess than ten days remain.
