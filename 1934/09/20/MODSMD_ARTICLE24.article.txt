Playing hop-skip-and-jump with a nia.]) of
the collegiate world, one finds many different
habits of dress on the various campuses that
surround the same (>OO American colleges
and universities.
Dropping hack to staid old Cornell on the
shores of beautiful Cayuga in Ithaca, New
York (home of Stanford's David Starr .Jordan)
one would scarcely venture to set foot on the
campus heading towards a classroom with
less than a complete suit, well pressed, plus
a most fashionable necktie.
Other institutions perhaps frown on noth
ing less than a nudist colony. At Stanford
attire follows Ihe rest of the Stanford makeup
and is most democratic at all times. On the
Quad, in classrooms, and in living groups,
one wears what one pleases and does not (pies
lion one's neighbors. The only governing in
fluence is cleanliness . . . and there is nothing
like a clean shirt, a good shave, and an occa
sional cleaning of the dirty cords to make
a fellow feel pretty good again.
Fancy plus-fours, Hollywood googv-goodies,
and spats are jusl as well oil' in the home
closet anyhow. Merely be comfortable, and
neat.
