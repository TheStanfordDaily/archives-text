# These Fond Parents
## 
### 
Inasmuch as most of the subject matter
herein h;is been addressed to newcomers to
the Farm, a word comes forth lo those fond
parents who gladly recall when they ran oil'
to college in keen anticipation of the fun
ahead.
II isn't 100 late for the folks back home to
live the old days over again and attend Stan
ford with Mary or Tim, and there are several
ways to do it. A year's subscription to the
Stanford Daily will let the folks back home
follow activities and read what the kids do
day by day. Mothers' Club meets third Tues
day each month, and the Illustrated Review,
alumni magazine, brings complete coverage of
Stanford affairs.
If you are a mother and have a child at
Stanford, drop around at the first meeting
of the Mothers' Club, October 1 (Â», or follow
his activities through the Daily at home. Pos
sibly (modesty hampers Ihe press) you'll
enjoy it.
