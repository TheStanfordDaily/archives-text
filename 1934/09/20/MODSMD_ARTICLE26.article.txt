When giant "Tiny" Thornhill rolled the
Indians' 1934 model Mig Med Machine out of
Encina gymnasium and dusted oil' the chassis
last Saturday, the wicked gleam in two spar
kling eyes promised a wee bit of trouble for
gridiron opponents this autumn.
A few injuries to date without any tough
scrimmage of an lionesl-to-goodness game
haven't changed the grinning visage one whit.
Thornhill intends to prove that last year was
no'accident and that the new Machine lacks
none of the power of last year's model and
even boasts a brand new cow-catcher that will
do for Bears, Bruins, Trojans and such and
can toss 'em much farther.
It's covering ground these days, towards
Santa CJara before the end of the month.
