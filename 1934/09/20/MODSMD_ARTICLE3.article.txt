Palo Alto 22151—just another
number now, but within two weeks
211 Stanford coeds will be answer
ing buzzers when that phono rings
and Lagunita Court will have offi
cially opened as not only the newest
but the most modern dormitory in
the world.
But when Daily representatives
walked over the mounds of dirt into
the empty office building of the new
group in order to view as much as
possible in time for this issue, no
211 coeds were there to greet them,
or to be called by buzzers.
Instead they were able to gaze
where and when they pleased, and
this beihg a rare privilege in wom
en's residence, a thorough inspec
tion was immediately begun.
Trees Planted
The offices, telephone desk, main
lobby, and auxiliary reception room
aic all contained in a separate build
ing, a central administration unit.
Directly beyond this building is the
court, terraced and in a T-shape.
Already eight live oaks, many citrus
trees, and olive trees 20 feet high
have been moved into the court and
dozens of potted plants and window
boxes are arriving daily. Lawn has
been planted, to make its appearance
about the first of October.
Connected by arches on either side
of the administration unit are the
two front living units, while the
ether two are at the four corners
of the T-shaped court.
Other buildings were found to be
individual reception and social
rooms for each unit. Each contains
a large room with fireplace, and ad
joining study and smoking rooms,
alx with inviting corners for radios
and comfortable sofas.
Pool in Court
At the far end of the court, ter
raced above the level of the other
buildings, is the dining room with a
red tiled floor, immense beams
across the ceiiing, and windows
overlooking the court in three direc
tions. On a terrace in front of the
dining room are a fountain and pool.
No odor of food was coming from
the kitchen, but it needed little im
agination to picture what could come
from the maze of stoves, baking
ovens, and electric refrigerators that
have been installed in the most
modern of kitchens.
As yet no coeds have appeared, so
it seemed safe to get a real look
behind the scenes into the rooms
themselves. Each girl will be in an
individual room, each bare of furni
ture when our visit was made, but
with wash basins already installed
and aerial wires for radios in each
room.
Furniture Installed
Not content with this look into the
empty buildings, our reporters vis
iled Miss Anastasia Doyle, director
of xesidence for women and direc
tor of Lagunita Court, and listened
as she enthusiastically told of the
furnishings to be installed this week
and plans for the opening on Octo
ber Ist.
"All furniture in student rooms
will be of Philippine mahogany of
the same type as that installed in
Elm Cottage and Mariposa lest
spring," she explained. "A 13-foot
table will go into the main reception
loom in the administration unit.
"Each of the social halls is being
finished differently," she continued.
"Yards of book cases have been
built into each, although at present
they are far from being filled. We
are gladly accepting any donations
of books from friend of the Univer
sity. A special appeal is made to
Roble alumnae."
The next subject brought up was
probably the most important one,
that of making calls at L;ft;unita
after the 211 do arrive. "Beside the
'house' phone in a booth in the ad
ministration unit," Miss Doyle ex
plained. "Callers will be met in the
cntrai lobby unless they know
which social room to go to, in which
case they can go directly there after
leaving the front desk.
"Girls will be able to arrange for
small parties of four or five couples
m the social rooms, she declared to
the group of newspaper men who
were even more interested.
Club Divided
Nancy Webster is the president of
Lagunita Club lor the coming quar
ter. The club itself will be divided
into four groups, one for each living
unit, with a chairman and a sponsor !
for each.
"Our plan is to combine the ad
vantages of the large and small
groups, ' stated Dean M;:ry Yost,
who has done more than her share
in inspiring the residence scheme
for Stanford's 1,000 women.
"With the opening of Lagunita
Court we are able to inaugurate a
policy of having all freshmen women
leave Roble at the end of their lirst
year. The only ones who return
will be those invited to act as spon- '
sors." i
Opens Monday
Lagunita Court will officially open
on Monday night, October 1, at the
first dinner. Guests will include the
Building Committee of the Board of
Trustees, President and Mrs. Wil
bur, Comptroller and Mrs. Roth,
Dean Yost. Miss Doyle, Miss Picker,
the architects arid builders and the
interior decorators.
And then Palo Alto 22151 should
be a busy number.
Over 50 per cent of the students at
Stanford during the past year were
at least partially self-supporting. j
