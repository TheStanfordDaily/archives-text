# BULL SESSION
## DOTH THE OLD ORDER PASS? 
### 
Just left the Farm, and they are
putting the finishing touches on La
gunita Court. The place is wide,
expansive, and Spanish—with just a
dab of green trimmings, and with a
dining hall like the Grand Central
Station. The thing is not only swell,
but ritzy; and no one will ever even
think of dubbing it "The New Bas
tile."
All of which means that there will
be 200 more women at Stanford.
But "new women" have been pour
ing into Stanford so fast of late that
"old women" are becoming some
thing of p refreshing novelty. "New
womifn," like "New Deal" has lost
much of its front-page appeal, albeit
there are those who yet wax fever
ish over the "prospects" of both.
With the passing of the "500" and
the burial of the "rough," much of
the old Stanford took the long, long
trail to Valhalla and rest. With 1,000
women and an increased total enroll
ment, the Farm, as such, is gone. For
it is a bit difficult to think of a
"Farm" where there is a milkmaid
for every few farmhands, and every
little breeze seems to whisper
"Louise" instead of "Freedom" as
of old.
Still, although they will probably
have to install pedestrian stop-lights
on the English Corner, and chaise

longues at the I us stop:-, for better
and for worse —much of the old 1
Stanford will probably remain.
For better, we cite the professo
rate, academic freedom, and the j
Quad- real joys that have stuck witli ;
generations of Stanford students,
when the more momentary and often
more pleasing pleasures have faded
away. Despite educational quack- i
ery in the Southland, reactionism j
all over the state, and flimsy, unro
mantic architecture everywhere— I
the professorate, academic freedom, )
and the Quad do not pas::. For which
we offer thanks.
For worse, we cite especially the !
pastoral peace of the Farm that lulls i
Stanford students into a sweet sleep !
of indifference to what happens be- j
yond the Sandstone Gates. That, j
too, will probably remain! Although J
with a gubernatorial race between a
pink horse and a white pony, there j
is the possibility of aroused student j
interest. Senator Stanford was in- i
terested in such races, and in a j
'"practical" university.
And so the old order of fanciful ,
memories does pass. But the juicy j
meat of Stanford—together with a J
few of the dried bones—remains. !
And while the meat lasts, thank God I
Stanford does not pass.
