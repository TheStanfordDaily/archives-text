# THE REVIEWER

summer's literary field has '
been a quiet one. Yet, with a little
delving enoi}gh good reading mate
rial could be found to keep even a
Stanfordite erudite through the va
cation time.
Stefan Zweig's "Marie Antoinette,"
although published in 1933, proved
to be the season's most interesting
historical biography. Zweig's style
gave realistic tenderness to his char
acter. Yet, he avoided the hysteria
and sentimentality usually attached
to tragic biographies of this type.
One of the book's most interesting
angles was the way its author pre
sented facts entirely in opposition
to accepted historical data, and then
proved them most conclusively.
Reading Isak Dinesen's "Seven
Gothic Tales" was an unusual expe
rience. The stories have such a pe- i
culiar, exotic style that even Dox'o- i
thy Canfield in the introduction I
advises the reader to find out for
himself the book's peculiar spell;
she admits herself to be at a loss to I

describe it. Subtle descriptive pas- [
sages about fantastic people against |
a background of unusual and bizarre 1
situations, are featured. It's the kind !
of book that makes one say, "Wasn't
it wonderful? But, really, what tl.Â«
devil did you make of it?"
Also written in an unusual man
ner, but in a much lighter vein, was I
Philip Wylie's "Finnley Wren." In
it the author and his hero hold long j
conversations about each other's;
conduct, and we actually find the j
book's protagonist leading his author
morally astray. Delightfully differ
ent, startlingly modern, this book is
ene of the high spots in pure enter- i
tainment reading. Philip Wylie and j
E. Balmer did "When Worlds Col- !
lide," and "After Worlds Collide." |
Both are written in the Amazing |
Story manner, but are so well <
thought out .that their absurdities j
become vivid and entertaining (if I
you enjoy the fantastic sort of;
thing).
