summer's literary field has '
been a quiet one. Yet, with a little
delving enoi}gh good reading mate
rial could be found to keep even a
Stanfordite erudite through the va
cation time.
Stefan Zweig's "Marie Antoinette,"
although published in 1933, proved
to be the season's most interesting
historical biography. Zweig's style
gave realistic tenderness to his char
acter. Yet, he avoided the hysteria
and sentimentality usually attached
to tragic biographies of this type.
One of the book's most interesting
angles was the way its author pre
sented facts entirely in opposition
to accepted historical data, and then
proved them most conclusively.
Reading Isak Dinesen's "Seven
Gothic Tales" was an unusual expe
rience. The stories have such a pe- i
culiar, exotic style that even Dox'o- i
thy Canfield in the introduction I
advises the reader to find out for
himself the book's peculiar spell;
she admits herself to be at a loss to I

describe it. Subtle descriptive pas- [
sages about fantastic people against |
a background of unusual and bizarre 1
situations, are featured. It's the kind !
of book that makes one say, "Wasn't
it wonderful? But, really, what tl.«
devil did you make of it?"
Also written in an unusual man
ner, but in a much lighter vein, was I
Philip Wylie's "Finnley Wren." In
it the author and his hero hold long j
conversations about each other's;
conduct, and we actually find the j
book's protagonist leading his author
morally astray. Delightfully differ
ent, startlingly modern, this book is
ene of the high spots in pure enter- i
tainment reading. Philip Wylie and j
E. Balmer did "When Worlds Col- !
lide," and "After Worlds Collide." |
Both are written in the Amazing |
Story manner, but are so well <
thought out .that their absurdities j
become vivid and entertaining (if I
you enjoy the fantastic sort of;
thing).
For pure Essex, stressed in the j
Dwight Fisk manner, we can't rec- j
oramend anything better (or worse".') !
than "Is My Flesh of Brass?" by j
p. J. Wolfeson. It has to do with ;
jife in a brownstone house, con- i
verted into a hospital for performing j
illegal operations on women. Ac
cording to the Book World, "the j
story moves swiftly on through j
brawls, tears, devotion and passion, '
through speak-easies, hotels, gamb- 1
ling houses, and surgery —and, in
our case—right through the back
door into a garbage can!
"Anitra's Dance" by Fannie Hurst j
employs the sex element more con- |
servatively, but still, amply enough
to soil the? book. Thi-; is the story of j
"a musician's musician" whose I
daughter Anitra gives all for love j
(both the spiritual and generally ac- [
cepted variety).
"Anthonj Adverse" still heads the 1
best seller list, having already netted
its author, Hervey Allen, something
like $250,000 in one year. It, as you j
probably know, is in the same class ;
as the telephone book and diction
ary. Wiitien in this same lengthy,
but literally accepted manner, is the
trilogy by T. S. Stribling, "The j
Forge," "The Store," and "Unfin- •
ished Cathedral." The last has been ;
the most popular, "mir
roring through its characters all
phases of American life." The trilogy |
lias been called the American "For
syte Saga," but in our humble opin
ion it can't compare with the Gals- j
worthy masterpiece.
Louis Golding's "Five Silver
Daughters" is also on the best seller i
lists. "The story revolves around j
the lives and loves of five sisters, j
The author, in it, preaches no mor
als, decides no issues; yet it gives j
one a more lenient attitude toward i
the errors of capitalism." Ho-hum! |
China remains the most popular j
background setting. "River Su- j
preme," by Alice (Oil for the Lamps [
of China) Hobart, deals with the two j
generation combat of a father and j
son to establish and maintain a boai j
line on the upper Yangtze River, j
against the larger background flow j
of the countless millions of surging
Chinese humanity. Andre Malraux, j
a Frenchman, won the 1933 Con
court Prize with "Man's Fate," a
story of revolutionary China. He is j
outstanding and unique for his abil- ,
ity to portray the terrors of revolu- I
tion and their effect on human iia- ;
ture. Ellery Queen gives a novel i
turn to the old murder yarn in
"The Chinese Orange Mystery." It's j
Chinese, at least in its title. "Ginger
Griffin' is another Chinese tale by 1
Ann Bridges, whose "Peking Picnic"
won the $10,000 Atlantic First Novel
Prize in 1932.
Erie Stanley Gardner's "Case of j
the Howling Dog" has been one of j
the more popular mystery stories, ;
and Stuart Palmer's "The Puzzle of
the Silver Persian" was a Crime !
Club choice. In it Miss Withers, the
spinster school teacher, again solves [
the crime as admirably as she did in
"The Penguin Pool Murders," "Mur- I
dor on the Blackboard," and the
lather feeble "Puzzle of the Pepper
Tree."
Zane Grey crashes through with j
)ther best seller in "Code of Ih? j
West," no different in form, sub
stance, than any of his former i
forty-some-odd books. Alexander i
Woollcott has written, with his usual
entertaining wit, the non-fiction hit, !
"While Rome Burns." "The Econ
omy of Abundance" is Stuart Chase's j
answer to the question, "Why should |
thcie bo poverty and starvation in a |

lend having an abundance of every
thing?"
"God's Little Acre" and "Tobacco
Road" (the latter a successful win
ter and summer Broadway produc-
I tion), were recently removed from
i the Teachers College, Columbia Uni
j versity. So rush to your local lend
| ing library before the West goes
i conservative, too. —Brill
