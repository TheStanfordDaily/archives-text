# STRIKE HAS LITTLE EFFECT ON CAMPUS
## 
### 
The general strike in San Fran
cisco this summer had little or no
effect on the campus. Stanford's
food supply, the biggest worry in
many minds, was in no dan
ger. An ample supply of staples had
been stored in campus storehouses,
and perishables, such as vegetables,
fruits, milk, and eggs, were being
delivered locally without interfer
ence.
Gasoline also was available, and at
no increase in prices. Regular trans
portation schedules were maintained
by all local companies, including the
Palo Alto Transit, Pacific Grey
hound, and the Southern Pacific
Company.
Construction on Lagunita Court,
the new women's dormitoi'y, was
not delayed by strikes, as workers
were out of the strike zone. Though
affiliated with San Francisco locals,
they were not called out by their
leaders.
The greatest hardship caused by
the strike was. temporary disruption
of local entertainment circles when
it was discovered that two members
of an orchestra engaged to play for
a jolly-up were union men and were
on strike. The men were replaced
in time for the dance, however.
