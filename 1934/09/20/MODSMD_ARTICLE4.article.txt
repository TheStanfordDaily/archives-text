# Pres. Wilbur Urges Joint Effort Here
## New, Returning Students Given Greeting 
### 
There is a thrill in coming back
to the Stanford campus or in seeing
it for the first time as a new stu
dent. Those of us who have been
here for years have the deepest af
fection for the Quad, the oaks, the
constantly changing stream of youth,
and for that conception of a Uni
versity that grew in the minds of
the Founders and became Stanford
University.
Each year we welcome the re
turning students and a thousand
or more new students who are on
the way to become graduates of our
University. We want you to love
Stanford, to hold its ideals high. We
want you thoroughly to enjoy your
selves in doing good work, in en
gaging in the multitude of activities
that are a part of Stanford life and,
above all, in contributing to our
joint effort to make this a happy,
wholesome and profitable place in
which to spend a few years of your
life.
