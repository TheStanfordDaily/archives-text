# New . Fund To Aid Students Is Inaugurated
## Generous Donations Swell Fund During Spring 
### 
Ten Stanford students are finding
their way along the rocky finan
cial road made smoother for them
this fall by scholarships given them
out of the newly organized Trustee's
Fund for Self-Supporting Students.
The latest plan for student aid on
the campus, this fund has grown
rapidly since its start early in the
spring, with donations from the stu
dent body, alumni, and friends of
the University.
Donations Needed
"The plans for this year are not
definite at the present time," states
Dr. Reynolds, director of the fund,
"although a renewed appeal will be
made to alumni for gifts. We hope
that students individually, as well
as classes and the A.S.S.U. will all
contribute their share.
"We assume that this year's stu
dent body will follow the lead set
last year by the A.S.S.U. when $1000
was given 'with the hope that fu
ture Executive Committees may see
fit to continue the donations,'" he
continued.
"Parents of those who are finan
cially able to come to Stanford can
do a great service through this fund
in helping those who find the going
more difficult," Dr. Reynolds re
minded. "Any donations, either
enough for scholarship or smaller
amounts for other forms of Student
Aid, will be welcome."
Endowment Limited
When Stanford was founded it
was the richest institution in the
country, with an endowment of
$21,000,000, although today Stanford
ranks twentieth, with an endowment
of $30,000,000, or $7,000 per student,
as against 16,000 at Yale.
With this limited capacity to assist
students, and a lower tuition than
either Yale or Harvard, every pos
sible method of assisting needy stu
dents has had to be used, particularly
through years of depression.
This was the background of the
formation of the fund last spring.
Since then support has been given
it by such groups as local Stanford
Clubs, as well as some in the east,
notably the Chicago Club, which
sent a donation and its own nom
inee for a scholarship.
