# Wrenn To Aid Job Selection
## Vocational Guidance May Be Asked in Registering 
### 
A new blank to be filled out in
registration books by entering stu
dents this fall will contain questions
on whether or not assistance is de
sider in choosing a major subject or
vocation.
Those who sign hi the affirmative
will be given the first opportunity to
interview Dr. C. Gilbert Wrenn,
secretary of the Committee on Voca
tional Guidance, whose office is in the
registrar's office in the Administra
tion building.
Much Material Available
Among the material available on
this subject are vocational interest
tests of Dr. E. K. Strong, available
for women as well as men this year,
and a collection of books on the vo
cational shelf at the library and in
Dr. Wrenn's office.
Later in the year lists will be
published of the names of business
and professional men on the penin
sula who are interested in giving
advice to students on vocational
problems.
Alice Ingraham Bodle, assistant
dean of women, will also devote
some of her time to counseling
women, particularly those that are
new this year, and helping them to
choose their major subjects and to
solve other problems.
Will Repeat Talks
Present plans of the Vocational
Guidance Committee indicate that
there will again be a series of talks
given by faculty leaders explaining
the work, requirements, and oppor
tunities of their departments for the
benefit of lower classmen and trans
fers. This plan was inaugurated last
year, and lectures were attended by
a large portion of the student body.
"Students are always welcome to
come with their problems," states
Dr. Wrenn. "Much varied informa
tion can be obtained from the dif
ferent departments of the registrar's
office, such as assistance in the
choosing of a major subject and a
vocation, improving methods of study
and scholarship, choosing courses,
and obtaining employment.
Dr. Gonzalez-Palencia of Madrid
taught at Stanford last year.
