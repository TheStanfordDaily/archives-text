# Daily Scribes Get More Space as Office Rebuilt

Two days before work began on j
this early edition of the Daily, the j
sumptuous quarters occupied by the 1
Farm's leading publication were j
somewhat of a mess.
Carpenters and not journalists j
were responsible. The Daily shack I
was about to be enlarged. Walls
came down; new walls came up. The j
old roof remained but grew by sev- j
era 1 feet of length. Twelve feet of I
floor space was added to the breadth J
of the original 24-foot shack. . !
Workers swarmed over the build
ing, and on September 16 new offi
ces were completed, new rails and
desks installed, and the paint was j
dry (well, almost).
The remodeling provides a larger .
room for the editorial staff, bigger
quarters for the heretofore cramped
editorial board, more commodious '<
business staff quarters, and a new
stereotyping room.
Professor Julius Peterson of the !
University of Berlin was so im- 1
pressed with the beauties of Califor
nia after teaching at Stanford sum- j
mer quarter that he wrote a paper
Ibc theme of which showed the im
possibility of a Californian being ;
satisfied with Paradise after living
in the "Golden State."
