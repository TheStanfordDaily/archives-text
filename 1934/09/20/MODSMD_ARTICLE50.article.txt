# Stanford Axe History Reviewed Origin, Loss and Recovery Told

### GEORGE WILSON 
". . . Give 'em the axe, where?"
Even the greenest freshman knows
it is to be administered "right in
the neck." But few know where the
big blade, which forms the symbol
of Stanford's oldest tradition and all
Stanford-California rivalry, came
from in the first place.
The first chapter in the history of
the axe was written in 1899. Thirty
five years have given rise to rumors
and conflicting stories, but a com
parison of all available records has
brought to light facts which answer
the questions of "Is it a fire axe?",
"Was it found in a barn?", or "Was
it stolen originally?"
In 1896 Will Irwin and Chris Brad
ley created the axe yell, which was
used to help early Cardinal teams to
victories over their Berkeley rivals.
But in 1899 the baseball team was
not faring very well. After dropping
the first game of the big series, it
was decided to get a material back
ground for the yell in order to
properly imbue the team with light.
The day before the second game,
April 13, yell-leader Billy Erb, now
a New York broker, went to Palo
AUo and obtained the ten-pound,
fifteen-inch broadaxe that is now on
display in the Union Cellar. He pur
chased it from the store of E. F.
Weisshaar, first fire chief of Palo
Alto, who died this summer. Erb
and Chris Bradley took the axe to
Pete, old campus blacksmith, and
had it sharpened and painted with
the red of the Cardinal.
The first real axe rally was held
that night. A Blue and Gold efiigy,
its head severed with the newly
sharpened ave, was burned on iop
of one of the famous old bonfires.
At the close of that rally the axe
was definitely a Stanford symbol.
That was the end of the first chap
ter of its history.
No true Stanfordite needs to be
told the later chapters. In spite of
the wild wavings of the axe at the
baseball game in San Francisco fol
lowing the rally, Cal won, and de
cided to take the axe as a trophy.
After trapping the small bodyguard
of Stanford men, the Bear follow
ers had a terrific fight on their hands
and a frantic race across the city to
the Ferry Building, where the cus
todian slipped by unnoticed with an
unidentified coed. One day old, the
axe had found a new owner.

For thirty-one years after that
game the blade resided in a Berkeley
bank vault, and appeared once each
year foi J California's axe rally. Nu
merous attempts to regain it were
made by Stanford roughs, and after
1927 the raids became yearly affairs.
But 1930 arrived and the axe was
still "across the bay."
In that year 21 Sequoia roughs
carefully planned their course of
action and made their way to Ber
keley for the axe rally on April 3.
The first a startled Stanford campus
knew of their journey was the cry
of "We've got the axe" that woke
them from their sleep late that night
and roused them into a triumphant
rally in front of Roble.
How the now "immortal twenty
one" worked their way into the
guard of the armored car, threw tear
gas bombs, posed as photographers,
and rushed back with the recap
tured axe is too recent history to
need repeating here.
Mingled headlines of "Axe Re
gained," "Axe Stolen," "Poor Cal,"
"Hate Stanford," and "Who's Got
the Axe?" trace the history during
the next few years.
Last year came the latest chapter,
when it was decided to make the
blade, newly-mounted on a placque,
the Big Game trophy. A perfectly
executed pass in the fourth quarter
one afternoon last November kept
the axe here one more year, and
anyone who has watched the varsity
in its early workouts this fall is con
fident that it still will be Stanford's
turn to yell "Who's got the axe?"
after the Big Game this year.
