# RYAN'S DEATH IS CONSIDERED GREAT LOSS TO SCIENCE
## 
### 
The engineering world suffered a
great loss this summer in the death
of Dr. Harris J. Ryan, professor
emeritus of the Stanford engineering
.school. Dr. Ryan died of a heart
attack on the night of July 3.
Ryan was born January 8, 1866, in
Powells Valley, Pa. He was one of
the first graduates of the Cornell
engineering school, winning his
M.E. degree in 1887. He served on
the Cornell faculty until IDOS, when
he came to Stanford. He received
an LL.D. degree from the Univer
sity of California in 1925. Here at
Stanford Dr. Ryan earned a world
wide reputation for his research ex
periments, the success and brilliancy
of which resulted in an endowment
fund for the Harris J. Ryan High
Voltage Laboratory, erected in 1926.
In this laboratory he performed
amazing experiments with transmis
sion of power over long distances,
and produced lightning bolts of gi
gantic voltage, subjecting their de
structive power to his will like a
Merlin of electricity.
Experiments Practical
His research was not confined to
the realm of pure theory. Dr. Ry
an's experiments usually have been
directed toward practical ends.
He also contributed toward the
discovery of the laws of corona loss
on high-voltage transmission lines,
and developed suitable types of in
sulation for preventing power loss.
He was the first engineer in America
to recognize the cathode ray tube as
a valuable apparatus for studying
high-voltage effects.
Colleagues Comment
The loss of Dr. Ryan will be a
severe blow to his friends and stu
dents as well as to the scientific
world. Commenting on his former
colleague, Dr. Joseph S. Carroll, as
sociate director of electrical engi
neering and acting director of the
Ryan Laboratory, said: "Dr. Ryan
was one of the gentlest, most un
selfish and most generous of men.
I have never heard a student or any
one associated with Dr. Ryan criti
cize him. When honors came to him
he always preferred to give the
lion's share to his assistants. He was
patient, tolerant, and earnest, a man
without personal enemies."
When Dr. Ryan retired from active
service in the University in 1931,
P. O. Crawford, '08, wrote of him
in the Stanford Illustrated Review:
"His concurrent occupation in con
temporary research gave Dr. Ryan's
teaching an atmosphere of breadth
and vision that was a continual joy
to the student. . . . His keen sense
of business ethics has kept him free
of commercial bias so that his counsel
has been available to all. ... A
sympathetic interest has made his
sincere advice eagerly sought by
graduates in times of difficulty. . . .
Mrs. Ryan shares honors with her
husband in a genuine human inter
est in all former students, which
makes the Ryan hospitality a Stan
ford tradition."
Held Many Posts
Dr. Ryan served variously as
president, vice-president, and com
mittee member of the American In
stitute of Electrical Engineers and
as a member of the American Asso
ciation for the Advancement of Sci
ence. He was on the jury of awards
for the department of electricity of
the 1893 World's Fair at Chicago,
was consulting engineer for the Los
Angeles Aqueduct Power Bureau
from 1904 to 1924, delegate to the
International Electrical Congress at
the St. Louis Exposition in 1904,
a member of the jury of awards at
the Panama-Pacific International
Exposition in 1915, president of the
American Society of Mechanical En
gineers and the American Electro-
Chemical Society, director of the

Anti-submarine Supersonics Lab
' oratory of the National Research
Council of Pasadena during the war,
and a member of the National Acad
j emy of Science. He was also the
author of a number of textbooks.
Dr. Ryan is .survived by his widow,
Katherine Fortenbaugh Ryan, whom
he married in 1888 at Halifax, Pa.,
and a younger brother, Luther W.
. Ryan, of Woodward, Pa.
