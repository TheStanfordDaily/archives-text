# Reservations Complete For Toyon and Branner
## 
### 
Upperclassmen are moving down j
in Encina.
In addition to having the fifth floor
of the frosh stronghold entirely to :
themselves, the upperclassmen and
graduate students will also be al- 1
lowed t.o live on the fourth floor of
Encina this year.
Toyon and Branner Halls, which I
boast the most desirable dormitory (
rooms on the campus, have no va- }
cancies remaining. Rooms in these
two halls have already been re
served for the fall quarter, according
to Miss Vivienne Church of the Dean
of Men's office.
There are still remaining a num
ber of unreserved rooms in Sequoia
Hall, last stronghold of the Stanford
Rough.
According to Miss Church anyone
taking a room in one of the halls for
the fall quarter must live in that
room for the entire quarter or for
feit room rent.
