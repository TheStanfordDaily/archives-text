# Card Loaning Is Forbidden

The assurance that every student
: deserving free admission to the sea
i son's opening football games would
' be served, but a plea for fairness,
was voiced to students by Jake Ir
win, ticket manager for the B.A.C.
"Any of these three—the new stu
] dent's certificate of admission to the
| University, a spring quarter certifi
cate of registration, or a summer
quarter certificate of registration—
I entitle the owner to free admission,"
Irwin emphasized,
Cases of emergency where a stu
dent deserves admittance, though he
is without a card, may possibly be
accommodated at game time, Irwin
added.
"The certificate of registration for
I autumn quarter will not be available
for use until the third game of the
i season. If before that time old cer
tificates are illegally transferred, the
j new certificate, entitling admission
; to coming games, must be forfeited,"
; Irwin said.
He urged students not to overlook
' the certificate at the back of their
books on registration day, "as this
j small card," he said, "is sole witness
jto membership in the Associated Stu
dents, and once lost its owner must
' pay admission to games."
On visiting the recorder's office
a Daily reporter learned that the new
' cards, colored a delicate pale-choco
late, are easily recognizable as the
i certificate to be saved.
