# Commander Wiley, Macon Head, Like Herbert Hoover
## 
### 
Herbert Hoover's alter ego—that is
(he first impression that one receives
| upon meeting Lieutenant Com
mander Herbert V. Wiley, of the
Macon. So closely does the Navy of
ficer resemble Stanford's most fa
mous alumnus, that when one faces
the affable commander at his home
j at 820 Hamilton Street, Palo Alto,
| one feels he must be in the San
( Juan Hill mansion.
Most r.ew students know that the
Macon, gigantic ship of the air, is
housed at Sunnyvale, and will soon
become familiar with it flying about
in the autumn haze, a huge, cigar
! shaped mass of silver.
Stanford recently came to the
technical assistance of the leviathan
when one of its fins was brought to
the aeronautics laboratory to be
trued up. The fin was also subjected
!to numerous tests in the wind
tunnel.
i Lieutenant Commander Wiley is
one of the three survivors of the
il-starred predecessor of the Macon,
the Akron. Inhabitants of Sunny
vale still remember how supersti
: tious sailors shook their heads
! gloomily when the Akron landed at
her mooring mast on May 13, 1932,
for the first time.
The commanding officer has the
reputation of manoeuvering more
extensively in his ship than any of
previous Navymen. Wiley is an out
j standing naval officer, an aeronau
tical expert, and an ardent golfer. He
takes a great deal of pride in his
ship and is very popular with his
personnel of 72.
Commander Wiley finds the red
tiled roofs of Stanford University a
landmark visible 20 miles away on a
clear day, and with a powerful pair
of binoculars, even further. The ship
i seldom goes above a ceiling of 10,000
feet, and is being perfected con
tinually as a defensive, scouting
| naval craft.
