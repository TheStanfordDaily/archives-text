# Hoerner, Stewart Add to Stanford's Golf Prestige
## 
### 
Lawson Little's possession of the
National Amateur title has in no way
relaxed the efforts of other Stanford
golfers in securing the University's
prestige for the futureâ€”if the work
of Verne Stewart and Jack Hoerner,
is an indication.
Unheralded amid acclaim for the
champion, both Hoerner and Stewart
qualified easily in the tournament
won by Little, and both marched
through to the fourth round before
being stopped.
