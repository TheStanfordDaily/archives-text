# Stanford Water Supply Reaches Abnormal Low
## 
### 
Although 107 million gallons in
Stanford's two reservoirs, Searsville
and Felt, seems like plenty of water,
James McDonnell, assistant super
intendent of buildings and grounds,
points out the fact that at this time
during any normal year there should
be about 200 million gallons on
hand.
