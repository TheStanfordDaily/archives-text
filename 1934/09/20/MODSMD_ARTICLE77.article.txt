# ROOTERS ADVISED TO LEARN YELLS
## 
### 
Stanford gridders will have a
rooters' section to cheer them on at
the Santa Clara game on September
29, according to Yell Leader Jimmy
Triolo. All newcomers are urged to
get their rooters caps by that time
and to memorize the rules for root
ers given below.
Co-operation with yell leaders and
the Rally Committee will be neces
sary for a successful rooting section,
Triolo points out. To make a suc
cessful yell, all rooters must start
together and stay in unison through
out the yell.
Here are the complete directions
for best results:
(1) Know the yells thoroughly.
(2) All start on the first syllable,
and watch the yell leaders.
(3) Keep together, snap it out at
the correct time by following the
motions, and force the syllables out
- -don't drag them.
(4) Save your voice by pitching
it up and forcing the sound against
your teeth.
(s)Please allow the yell leader to
do the talking. There's plenty of
time to yell, so save your breath.
(6) Don't boo, or shout catcalls,
at anybody!
(7) Sit well lined-up in straight
lows, and wear a white shirt if pos
sible. The effect is much better.
(8) If you want anything, ask the
man in the Red Cap. But don't argue
with the Rally Committee. They
are at the games to help you, not to
act as a debating squad.
(9)LEARN THE HYMN! It will
be sung every game, regardless of
whether we win or lose. Every
Stanford rooter will be expected to
stay until the Hymn has been sung.
