# ALUMNAE NUPTIALS ON UPWARD TREND

### 
Not only do Stanford's athletic |
teams surpass those of California, !
but in the game of marriage Stan- i
ford's women are several up on'
Cals. At least that is the conclusion
to be drawn from the fact that only
a third of California's women grad
uates are married, while 63 per cent ,
of Stanford alumnae are enjoying
"wedded bliss."
The University of California
Alumni Association recently sent a
questionnaire to 9000 women grad
uates of U.C., and the answers to
this questionnaire furnish the figure j
quote above. The Stanford figure is j
based on data in the 1931 issue of
the Alumni Directory.
Furthermore, 45 per cent of the
Stanford women who are married j
are married to Stanford men.
The figures given above are quite |
different from the ones quoted in a
biological research report completed j
in 1917. At that time only 48.5 per
cent of Stanford women graduates
were married, and few of them to
Stanford men. On the other hand,
58.6 per cent of Cal alumnae were
married.
Some sort of conclusion is to be
drawn from the fact that in recent
years more Stanford women and
fewer women from Cal are finding
husbands. Significant also is the fact
that more Stanford women are
choosing their mates from among
their fellow graduates.
The Daily staff numbers over 70
members.
