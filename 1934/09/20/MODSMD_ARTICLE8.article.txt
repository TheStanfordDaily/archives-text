# Fraternities, Sororities Use Vacation Time For Improvements
## THETAS PUT UP FRONT Kappas, Alpha Phis Build; Others Apply Paint 
### 
Any casual observer passing the
groups of carpenters and painters
eating lunch on lawns all up and
down the Row this summer could
have told without further glance
that much was being done to houses
to make room for large pledge
classes and generally brighten up
the old walls.
The Thetas started it by rebuild
ing. The Kappas and Alpha Phijs
followed suit by enlarging, and it
wasn't long before wet paint signs
were in front of nearly every house.
S.A.E. Paints
But perhaps we'd better start our
tour of the Row at the beginning.
Not far past the Bookstore the S.A.E.
j house glistens under a new coat of
paint.
The Sigma Chis kept up with the
others by enlarging their sleeping
porch and repainting the house.
Next door to them, a large addition
to the Kappa house has been built,
â– <> wing on the side toward the Kappa
Sigma house, with an outdoor bar
becue grill.
Across from them the familiar old
of the Beta house- is no more,
I but has been hidden by a fresh white
coat of paint.
Thetas Rebuild
And then, a few steps on up the
Row a new, three-story stucco house
1 appears where a dark shingle, vine
covered house stood in June. Ap
i parently the Thetas couldn't let the
Phi Delts have the distinction of
1 having the newest house on the
campus any longer.
The only other major change on
the Row appears next door in the
form of a new unit added to the
Alpha Phi house, which looks large
enough to comfortably house their
24 pledges.
Alpha Delts Paint
Other changes are mainly due to
the painters' brush. The Alpha
Delts have repainted with white and
a bright green roof. Across the street
the Theta Delts have completely re
finished inside, the Pi Phis have
repainted, Alpha O's redecorated the
interior of the house, the Theta Xi's
repainted the outside, and way up
on top of the hill a shining new
white coat of paint can be seen on
the Phi Psi house. On Salvatierra,
the Alpha Sigs remodeled inside,
end Madrono Hall has undergone
complete remodeling and refurnish
ing, promising to surprise those who
lnok inside on October Ist.
