# APPLICANTS, JOBS TO BE PLENTIFUL AT WORK BUREAU
## 
### 
Although Stanford has often been
called a rich man's college, Mrs.
I Irene Spenner of the Employment
Bureau states that at least half the<
student body is to some extent self
supporting. Sometimes as many as
65 per cent of the students earn
I money from jobs which they have
received through the Bureau.
Mrs. Spenner has developed her
own system for keeping track
lof jobs and job hunters. Each
applicant fills out an extensive form,
giving information about his back
-1 ground, education, experience, hob
i by, and the jobs he prefers. The
Employment Bureau keeps a com
plete file of every applicant, and a
further file of jobs available, with
the names of those who can fill the
i positions under each job.
Ability is the first consideration
in filling a job. Mrs. Spenner illus
j trates by saying that if, for instance,
there were two applicants for a cer
tain job, one who needed to earn but
| 50 per cent of the money necessary
; to put him through college, and the
other who needed to earn all his
expenses, the position would be
! given to the better man, regardless
of whether the loser needed the
money more. It is only by the
policy of giving the employer the
ablest man or woman for the job
that he will again ask the Stanford
Employment Bureau to fill his next
vacancy.
While jobs are plentiful this year,
so are applicants. According to Mrs.
Spenner an unusually large number
of people are back early this year.
She is unable to predict the number
of positions which will still be avail
; able by October 1.
