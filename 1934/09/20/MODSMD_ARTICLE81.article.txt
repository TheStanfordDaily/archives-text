### 
Fire side retrospects of last season
can be discarded for the prospects of
a coming football season since the
Football Annual has come out with
the last word in 1933 All-Americans,
and the dope on the new season.
The dope book, just out, names
Corbus, Grayson, and Moscrip among
their Ail-Americans, placing Corbus
as tops at guard; while Muller, at
center, and O'Conner, who doesn't
return to guard this year, are men
tioned as outstanding and consistent.
O'Conner is pictured at the top of
the dope sheet on Pacific Coast foot
ball.
Stanford is rated no better than
21st team of the nation for 1933 while
Oregon, co-conference champs rate
number 7; but this is compensated
by the Football Annual naming the
Stanford team of 1934 as "possibly
the best in the nation."
