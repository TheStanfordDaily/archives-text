After making excursions to places
of interest in the Reich's capital city,
they travelled eastward, crossed the
Polish corridor and visited Danzig.

historic landmarks.
At Weimar, culture-capital of the
Reich, the Stanford professors spent
many hours at the Goethe Museum,
the Goethehaus, and other places
