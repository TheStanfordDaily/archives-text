# Happy Chappies Refuse to Bounce Rubber Dollars
## 
### 
Despite the federal move towards j
the curtailment of farm production,,
the Chaparral will not cut down its :
crop this year, stated Old Boy Steed- 1
man, whistling- through, a piece of
sir".v and doint very well.
Rather, the Venerable Hayssed j
promises a cut-up crop. During the
summer, the Happy Chappies have j
been making play while the sun j
shone and are preparing to harvestj
a bumper crop of whimsies (grave
yard variety) snickers (not worn on j
the feet), and gigantus guffawfus.
"The sky's the limit," mused the j
editor, "So's the magazine — so's j
Stanford —so's your old man."
This year the magazine will be j
larger than usual with several i
innovations and features. It will be |
an alright thing—everything—past, j
present, and features. With the dollar
being inflated, a brisk mental calcu- ;
lation will prove what a bargain the i
Chappie offers. Nine bigger issues ;
for a smaller dollar means —well, it !
is colossal!- (Note this computation j
by an accountant, not the staff.
Upon cross examination —upside J
down and backwards —the Old Boy j
coyly admitted that the October issue ,
would have a definite theme. |
"Themes the thing to do." he parried j
from behind the inkwell. "Back to i
the Farm" will be the title—all about j
the Stanford farm —your farm —all j
about the back —your back—or aren't 1
you? The cover will feature a dif- J

Now you lads and lassies, scurry j
through the Daily—watch out! Go j
carefully or you will trip—and find
the article (it's a game) which tells j

in one easy, lesson if you can play ,
five notes on the glockenspiel.
