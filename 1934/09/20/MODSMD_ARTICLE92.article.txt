# Panhell Issues Revised Set of Rushing Rules
## Spring, Summer Rushing Will Be Considered Unethical New Clause Relating To Transfers Included 
### 
Sorority rushing this year will be
conducted under a new set of rules i
formulated last spring by Panhel
lenic. The rules contain a new
clause pertaining to transfers and
define more clearly unethical con
duct.
The new regulations follow:
1. Spring and summer rushing is
considered unethical conduct, and as
such is subject to penalty. Spring
and summer rushing consists in en
tertainment of new women on or of!
the campus, previous to their matri
culation, in parties at which there
is no member of another sorority
present.
2. Bidding shall take place in win
ter quarter and in spring quarter
according to a plan to be agreed
upon.
3. All affiliated transfers must live
in the house. If a chapter on the
Stanford campus wishes to affiliate
a transfer who is entering with au
tumn quarter, the chapter must
notify the Dean of Women of inten
tion to affiliate the transfer by the
15th of September.
4. The period of rushing shall be
divided into two parts: entertaining
itÂ» autumn quarter for five days
when new women may not accept
more than one date with the same
house; and rushing for a period of
eight days in winter quarter, during
which a house may not make more
than one date in advance with a
new v/oman.
5. No sorority woman can be in a
private room in any University
housing group with a new woman
even though a sponsor is present.
Panhellenic encourages social con
tact between new women and soror
ity women in classes, on the athletic
field, and at any gathering in con
nection with student or University'
activities.
6. Sisters and cousins may be to
gether at any time or place, pro
vided that no sorority sister or other
new woman is present.
7. An affiliated transfer is not to
take part in fall or winter rushing.
