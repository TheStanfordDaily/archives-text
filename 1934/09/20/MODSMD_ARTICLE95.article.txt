# SPONSOR'S DUTIES ARE OUTLINED BY DEAN G. B. CULVER
## 18 Upperclassmen Chosen For Encina Duties 
### 
Encina Hall, Stanford's sandstone
receptacle for the annual crop of
new-born Cardinal papooses, will
.soon be the scene of grÂ«*at commo
tion with the arrival of several hun
dred freshmen at its portals.
Welcoming the newcomers to En
cina, in which every freshman must
live for three quartrs, will be a
group of eighteen sponsors, all ex
perienced Stanford upperclassmen.
Their duty is to help the newcom
ers make themselves feel at home,
give advice, set examples, and aid
in the frosh adapting himself to his
new surroundings.
Duties Outlined
As stated by Dean of Men George
B. Culver, the sponsors' duties or
functions "are similar to the duties
that the best elements in any living
group should take upon themselves
as regards the intellectual, social and
physical welfare of the newer and
younger members of their organi
zations. No sponsor who fails to
sense his responsibility and oppor
tunity in these regards lasts very
long, as appointments are from
quarter to quarter."
Sponsorships to Encina Hall are
honorary appointments made by the
University, being based largely upon
personal records, as well as on sat
isfactory scholarship. In addition
sponsors must have certain demon
strated qualities that indicate fitness
for the very important work of help
ing new Lower Division men to ad
just themselves to the academic and
social life of Stanford.

come the list of sponsors who will
be in charge of Encina's new resi
dents for the 1934 fall quarter.
