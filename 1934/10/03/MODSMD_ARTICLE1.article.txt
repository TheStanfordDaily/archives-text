# Ceremony, Dinner Celebrate Opening Of Lagunita Court
## Ultra-Modern Dormitory Houses 211 New Occupants 
### Charlotte Burridge 
With the signing of the Lagunita
history by Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur,
trustees, and leaders in the construc
tion and iurnishing of the building,
Lagunita Court, Stanford's new
women's dormitory, was officially
opened at dinner Monday night. The
signatures were placed in a large
antique book found by the interior
decorator at a bindery.
Already the government is func
tioning. rooms are being settled, and
traditions being made by the 211
delightfully surprised women ad
mitted to Stanford's youngest "brain
child."
Dream Comes True
As those responsible for the crea
tion of the most modern dormitory
in the world saw their work com
pleted, Lagunita Court was trans
ferred from the realm of day-dreams
to that of reality. In every detail it
has been designed to combine prac
ticality and beauty. Authorities in
each line of work were employed in
the building's perfection.
Earthquake-resisting construction
combined with fireproof finishings,
sound-absorbing ceilings, and large
windows, laid the safe and pleasant
foundation for the interior decora
tors to finish.
Four Separate Units
The dormitory consists of four
separate residence units, with a spa
cious dining hall at the back of the
group and the main lobby and re
ception rooms in a separate building
across the front of the "T"-shaped
court. The units, named after the
trees in the courtyard, ai"e Casa
Naranja, Casa Magnolia, Casa Adel
pha, and Casa del Eucalypto. Each
has its own social rooms sharply
individualized in furnishings and
color schemes. Administration of
Lagunita will also combine the ad
vantages of small and large group
ings by having a president, sponsor,
and head resident in each Casa,
held together by the general officers
of the entire dormitory. Miss Anas
tasia Doyle is director of Lagunita
Court, and Mrs. Ada Lthan director
of the dining hall.
Student officers are Nancy Web
ster, president; Betty Church, vice
president; Helen Warson, secretary;
Charlotte Burridge, treasurer; Lois
Bassi, head of the Committee of Five.
New Women Create Need
Necessity tor additional University
residence for women arose from the
decision of the Board of Trustees,
made last year, to increase the en
rollment of Stanford women. Dr.
Wilbur realized that to meet the
greater need for living accommo
dations on the campus another hall
would be inevitable. He laid the
matter before the Board of Trustees
which later made appropriation for
Lagunita Court.
J hn Bakewell, Arthur Brown,
and Earnest Weike were engaged
as architects. They-had previously
completed the women's gymnasium
and showed their understanding of
the type of architecture appropriate
to Stanford.
George Wagner, connected with
Stanford building activities for
many years, had the general con
tract for Lagunita Court. With him
worked Roy Button, superintendent
of buildings and grounds.
To enhance the structural beauty
of the buildings, Leslie Kiler planned
the landscaping and gardening. To
assure feminine appeal in furnish
ings, a women's firm was entrusted
with that responsibility. The dormi
tory rooms, saved from monotonous
similarity by varying personal fur
nishings of the residents, have wash
stands, electric plugs, and attractive
Philippine mahogany furniture in
stalled.

New Women Create Need
Necessity tor additional University
residence for women arose from the
decision of the Board of Trustees,
made last year, to increase the en
rollment of Stanford women. Dr.
Wilbur realized that to meet the
greater need for living accommo
dations on the campus another hall
would be inevitable. He laid the
matter before the Board of Trustees
which later made appropriation for
Lagunita Court.
J hn Bakewell, Arthur Brown,
and Earnest Weike were engaged
as architects. They-had previously
completed the women's gymnasium
and showed their understanding of
the type of architecture appropriate
to Stanford.
George Wagner, connected with
Stanford building activities for
many years, had the general con
tract for Lagunita Court. With him
worked Roy Button, superintendent
of buildings and grounds.
To enhance the structural beauty
of the buildings, Leslie Kiler planned
the landscaping and gardening. To
assure feminine appeal in furnish
ings, a women's firm was entrusted
with that responsibility. The dormi
tory rooms, saved from monotonous
similarity by varying personal fur
nishings of the residents, have wash
stands, electric plugs, and attractive
Philippine mahogany furniture in
stalled.
With the signing of the Lagunita
history by Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur,
trustees, and leaders in the construc
tion and iurnishing of the building,
Lagunita Court, Stanford's new
women's dormitory, was officially
opened at dinner Monday night. The
signatures were placed in a large
antique book found by the interior
decorator at a bindery.
Already the government is func
tioning. rooms are being settled, and
traditions being made by the 211
delightfully surprised women ad
mitted to Stanford's youngest "brain
child."
Dream Comes True
As those responsible for the crea
tion of the most modern dormitory
in the world saw their work com
pleted, Lagunita Court was trans
ferred from the realm of day-dreams
to that of reality. In every detail it
has been designed to combine prac
ticality and beauty. Authorities in
each line of work were employed in
the building's perfection.
Earthquake-resisting construction
combined with fireproof finishings,
sound-absorbing ceilings, and large
windows, laid the safe and pleasant
foundation for the interior decora
tors to finish.
Four Separate Units
The dormitory consists of four
separate residence units, with a spa
cious dining hall at the back of the
group and the main lobby and re
ception rooms in a separate building
across the front of the "T"-shaped
court. The units, named after the
trees in the courtyard, ai"e Casa
Naranja, Casa Magnolia, Casa Adel
pha, and Casa del Eucalypto. Each
has its own social rooms sharply
individualized in furnishings and
color schemes. Administration of
Lagunita will also combine the ad
vantages of small and large group
ings by having a president, sponsor,
and head resident in each Casa,
held together by the general officers
of the entire dormitory. Miss Anas
tasia Doyle is director of Lagunita
Court, and Mrs. Ada Lthan director
of the dining hall.
Student officers are Nancy Web
ster, president; Betty Church, vice
president; Helen Warson, secretary;
Charlotte Burridge, treasurer; Lois
