## 
### 
Contrary to the stories given by t
the newspapers, Sam Klopstock,
Dink Templeton's ace sophomore:
hurdler, was not injured seriously
when the car in which he was driv
ing overturned on a southern Cali
fornia highway this summer. Klop
stock's track career will not be
threatened, much less closed, by the
accident.
The other casualty among the tim- ;
her toppers, the compound fracture !
of the right arm suffered by Captain I
Gus Meier last April, is an injury j
which is by nature long in healing,
but according to Tcmpleton, Meier's i
arm is "coming along all right."
