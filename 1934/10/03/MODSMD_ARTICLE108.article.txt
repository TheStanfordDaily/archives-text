# "Dink" Asks Material tor Fall Track
## Templeton Plans Weekly Practice Meets 
### 
With lour of "The Seven" who
brought back a victory in both
IC4-A and NC2-A meets returning
to form a nucleus for his 1935 track
and lield team, Coach '"Dink" Tem
pleton summons aspirants for the
fall track season, which starts this
week.
Sam Klopstock, Johnny Mottram,
Chuck Nimmo, and A1 Blackman are
the four, leaving the three, John Ly
man, Slinger Dunn, and Bud Deacon
among the ranks of the alumni.
Coach Templeton is reluctant at
present to give any definite predic
tion about his team. He is sure of
four men, but others of last year's
varsity, the '37 frosh, and jaysee
transfers are still not all signed up.
Two San Mateo J.C. transfers, Ray
Dean and Warren Dixon, are ex
pected to enroll at the Farm, and
are sure point-getters. Dean has run
100 yards in 9.7 and is consistent
under 10 flat. Although a small man,
he is also a dependable 220 runner.
Dixon, formerly of Mission High and
the Olympic Club, has a mark of
under 1:58 in the half mile, and is
strong enough to recuperate quickly
and run two fast races in one day.
Templeton plans to test his ath
letes once a week in informal com
petition, using the interclass meth
od. The first meet will probably be
lun off in four or five weeks.
