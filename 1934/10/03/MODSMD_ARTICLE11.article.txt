# Row Houses Spruced Up
## Thetas Still Building; Some Have Redecorated 
### 
What with the Thetas rebuilding,
the Kappas and Alpha Phis adding
bigger and better sleeping quarters,
and scarcely any house without a
little touching up during the sum
mer, there is plenty of new timber
and many wet paint signs along the
Row. Interiors have been redeco
rated and new furnishings put in—
and house bills run up.
The Thetas are still Existing in
temporary straits. The old shingled
structure is new bristling new stucco,
three floors. Everybody has moved
in, the upstairs being habitable, but
the lower staircases are still in the
process of installation. A couple of
weeks will elapse before the job is
finished.
Kappas Add Wing
Kappa Kappa Gamma added a full
three-floor extension onto the star
board side, aft. The wing includes
an outdoor fireplace, living rooms,
and sleeping quarters. Workmen are
not quite finished, but will be "in a
week or so."
Seven new rooms have made the
Alpha Phi residence roomy enough
for the swollen pledge class. They
are on the Theta side. A new kitchen
and dining room facilitate the gro
cery consuming department. A sun
deck over the enclosed sleeping
porch will eliminate Roble home
sickness among members, and all
will be welcome in the new study
hall. In the rear is a new terrace,
while outside shines a new paint
job. Repairs are practically finished.
Many Paint, Redecorate
Exterior repainting brightens up
the Sigma Chi, Pi Phi, Theta Xi,
Phi Psi, Beta, Alpha Delt, and Delt
houses.
Delta Gamma, with redecoration,
Chi Omega with redecoration and re

rooms completely remodeled, head
the list, of interior fixin's, while
minor repairs were made on Delt,
Tri Delt, A.K.L., Deke, D.U., Phi
Kap, Kappa Sig, and Sigma Chi
chapter houses. Kappa Alpha started
late and is at present painting
inside and out, redecorating the in
terior, and enlarging the outside
porches.
