## Indians Fade Toward Close After Showing Up Well In Three Periods 
### 
They looked good at the start,
anyway.
That is Stanford's consolation after
a tie with Santa Clara last Saturday,
as Coach Tiny Thornhill is preparing
to escort his Indians on their first
trip, and to meet their first confer
ence opponents at Portland Satur
day afternoon.
More than thirty Cardinal foot
ball players will embark for the
Northwest to meet Oregon State Col
-1 lege tomorrow afternoon.
After holding the toughened
Broncos for three quarters without
' permitting a completed pass or a
first down, Stanford fell before a heat
1 wave Saturday and looked bad gen
i ( rally during the fourth period while
; Santa Clara proceeded to overcome
! odds and deadlock the final score at
| 7 to 7.
After consistently gaining ground
1 and playing in Bronco territory dur
ing the first quarter, Stanford opened
a steady goalward march of forty
I yards to a touchdown early in the
! second period.
After a twenty-four-yard pass
from Bob Maentz to Bones Hamilton,
Fullback Bobby Grayson furnished
the final thrusts and plunged over
from the two-yard line, with a well
directed place kick by Monk Mos
crip adding the extra point. Frank
Alustiza held the ball.
Broncos Hold Kali
Just as the first three quarters
were all Stanford's, the final period
. belonged completely to Santa Clara.
The Broncos opened by taking a
Stanford punt in midfield, and they
did not relinquish the ball until they
had scored, and converted that score
to tie the count at 7-all.
A 17-yard pass from Don de Rosa
to Hall, substitute quarterback, ae
, counted for Santa Clara's score. Hall
I caught the ball in the open just at
the goal line. "Frisky" Kaliski
evened the score with a place kicked
j conversion.
Santa Clara again threatened a
few moments later as several
passes in a row began to click. An
attempted field goal from the 13-
, yard line was partially blocked to
end thus drive. The Bronco eleven
was once again in Stanford territory
as the game ended.
Stanford opened the contest by
quickly advancing to the Santa
Clara 3t5, from where Moscrip at
tempted a place-kick. The ball fell
short, however, barely rolling over
the goal line.
Most of the rest of the first period
took place in the invaders' district,
with Stanford claiming possession on
the 15-yard line as the quarter closed.
Although they did not threaten in
! ihe second period after their paying
drive, the Indians spent most of the
quarter in the Santa Clara end of I
the field and were on the 30 as the
gun sounded completion of the half. |
The Thornhill men opened the
third section of the contest with an
' other scoring drive that ended in
! side the ten-yard line. Cardinal
hopes for the game were concluded
a moment later, as Stanford fumbled
in midfield and was forced to take
the defensive for the remainder of j
the period.
The week before, Stanford opened j
her season in good fashion with a de
cisive 48 to 0 victory over the San

; Santa Clara proceeded to overcome

| 7 to 7.
After consistently gaining ground
1 and playing in Bronco territory dur
ing the first quarter, Stanford opened
a steady goalward march of forty
I yards to a touchdown early in the
! second period.
After a twenty-four-yard pass
from Bob Maentz to Bones Hamilton,
Fullback Bobby Grayson furnished
the final thrusts and plunged over
from the two-yard line, with a well
directed place kick by Monk Mos
crip adding the extra point. Frank
Alustiza held the ball.
Broncos Hold Kali
Just as the first three quarters
were all Stanford's, the final period
. belonged completely to Santa Clara.
The Broncos opened by taking a
Stanford punt in midfield, and they
did not relinquish the ball until they
had scored, and converted that score
to tie the count at 7-all.
A 17-yard pass from Don de Rosa
to Hall, substitute quarterback, ae
, counted for Santa Clara's score. Hall
I caught the ball in the open just at
the goal line. "Frisky" Kaliski
evened the score with a place kicked
j conversion.
Santa Clara again threatened a
few moments later as several
passes in a row began to click. An
attempted field goal from the 13-
, yard line was partially blocked to
end thus drive. The Bronco eleven
was once again in Stanford territory
as the game ended.
Stanford opened the contest by
quickly advancing to the Santa
Clara 3t5, from where Moscrip at
tempted a place-kick. The ball fell
short, however, barely rolling over
the goal line.
Most of the rest of the first period
took place in the invaders' district,
with Stanford claiming possession on
the 15-yard line as the quarter closed.
Although they did not threaten in
! ihe second period after their paying
drive, the Indians spent most of the
quarter in the Santa Clara end of I
the field and were on the 30 as the
gun sounded completion of the half. |
The Thornhill men opened the
third section of the contest with an
' other scoring drive that ended in
! side the ten-yard line. Cardinal
hopes for the game were concluded
a moment later, as Stanford fumbled
in midfield and was forced to take
the defensive for the remainder of j
the period.
The week before, Stanford opened j
her season in good fashion with a de
cisive 48 to 0 victory over the San
i Jose State Teachers College.
They looked good at the start,
anyway.
That is Stanford's consolation after
a tie with Santa Clara last Saturday,
as Coach Tiny Thornhill is preparing
to escort his Indians on their first
trip, and to meet their first confer
ence opponents at Portland Satur
day afternoon.
More than thirty Cardinal foot
ball players will embark for the
Northwest to meet Oregon State Col
