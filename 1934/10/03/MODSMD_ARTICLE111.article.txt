# VARSITY, YEARLING SOCCERMEN BEGIN WORKOUTS TODAY
## Cards Play San Jose State In Practice Saturday 
### 
Indian soccermen will take io the
practice field this afternoon at 4
o'clock in answer to Coach Harry
Ma loncy'.s call to arms as the veteran
minor sports mentor starts an in
tensive two weeks conditioning pe
riod which is all that remains before
the season opens on October 17.
Only four lettermen, a number of
second string men from last year,
.some upcoming frosh and a handful
of transfers are all that Coach Ma
loney has to pin his hopes on for
winning the conference title which
slipped from his grasp by one lone
l;ame last season.
Schedule Nearly Heady
But Coach Maloney is not down
hearted over his prospects. Instead

his chief' concern is the Card sched
ule which is practically complete ex
cept for one all-important exception
—an exception v/hich apparently
means a great deal to all connected
with University soccer —the proposed
game with U.C.L.A.
It has been some years since the
team has journeyed farther afield
than Berkeley and San Francisco
and it is the hope of soccer heads
that a game can be played in Los j
Angeles on Thanksgiving.
Practicc Opens Today
The schools now on the schedule !
include San Mateo Junior College, |
San Francisco University, San Joso j
State College and University of i
California.
This afternoon both the frosh and j
varsity squads will be put through a
short work-out with daily practice
sessions to follow. Later in the sea- j
son each of the two squads will prob- |
ably work three times a week. \c- j
tual competition will open next Sat- j
urday when a practice game will be j
played with San Jose State college.
From John Moore, hist year's var
sity player who will coach the Frosh
squad this season, comes the word
that colleges of the bay region are
considering forming a freshman
league. If this does not go into ef
fect this year the yearling men will
play a series of games with Cal
Frosh, San Mateo Frosh and several
high school teams.
To Play San Mateo
The varsity schedule opens with j
the San Mateo game here on Octo
ber 17. Last year both games with j
the J.C. were tied.
Next in line is the game with the
conference champions, University of
San Francisco, in the City on October j
20. One win and one defeat was the !
