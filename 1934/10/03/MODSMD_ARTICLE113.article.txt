They don't come back, won't come
back, once they're gone.

geance, last spring and summer, and
has just returned from a record
smashing trip to Europe with a
chosen American group of track and
field athletes.
It was two and one-half years ago

The next year, before he could
stage a come-back, Stanford's Blazer

of competition nearly all season. He
partially recovered and took a sixth
place in the 1.C.4-A. half-mile. Just
another burned-out once-a-track
man, said the experts.
All of which leads up to the point
that they do come back. If they're
not really gone.

He travelled in Norway, Sweden,

of victories against the best Europe
offered in the half mile.

They don't come back, won't come
back, once they're gone.
That philosophy may be all right,
1 but if so, Big Ben Eastman, Stan
ford's immortal Blazer, wasn't as far
j ;;one as many people said a couple
| of years ago.
Ben came back, and with a ven
geance, last spring and summer, and
has just returned from a record
smashing trip to Europe with a
chosen American group of track and
field athletes.
It was two and one-half years ago
that the blond Cardinal flash was
really at the peak of his collegiate
career, and every week on the track
schedule brought him new glories.
Just a few short months later, the
invincible Ben took three second
places to Pennsylvania's Bill Carr.
That was what started it. They all
began to speak of the sad case of
the Ben that had been.
The next year, before he could
stage a come-back, Stanford's Blazer
pulled a muscle which kept him out
of competition nearly all season. He
partially recovered and took a sixth
place in the 1.C.4-A. half-mile. Just
another burned-out once-a-track
man, said the experts.
All of which leads up to the point
that they do come back. If they're
not really gone.
Starting last spring, Eastman be

again approached the limelight. In
