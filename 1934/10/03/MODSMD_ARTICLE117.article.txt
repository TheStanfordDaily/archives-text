# COACH JOHN BUNN HOPEFUL AS HOOP WORKOUTS START
## Mid-Western Barnstorming Four Being Planned 
### 
"Besl team .since I've been here!"
This is Coach John Bunn's em
phatic declaration of Cardinal bas
ketball prospects this year. No less
j than nine varsity lettermen will be
back again for action with last year's
| powerful Frosh .squad to swell their
; ranks. Thus Coach Bunn's enthus-
I iasm is well founded.
In only one position will Stanford
lack superior strength ihis year—the
center post. The loss of Hat Edelen,
captain and center of last season,
leaves a vacancy which Kenny Nobs,
sub center, may find difficulty in
filling. Bunn had hopes of working
Art Stoeffen, a six-foot four-inch
| sophomore transfer, into the pivot
5 post, bm recent developments show
| that the rangy eager will be ineli
| gible for basketball competition this
i winter.
Begin Immediately
The quintet aspirants will waste no
j time getting into shape. Assistant
j Coach Chuck Glasgow will be super
i vising affairs until Coaches Bunn
j and Bradshaw finish (heir work with
! the Frosh football aggregation.
| Workouts will be held three d;iys
I each week, beginning immediately.
Keith Topping, Arne Anderson,
Emil Cowing and Wytze Gorter, all
forwards, are expected to be the big
guns of the Card offense with Robin
Lindsey, Gordon Mallati'att, and
Dave Farber in the guard roles.
Sophs Are Strong
Bryan "Dinty" Moore, Bill Quade,
Carl Schott, Howell Turner, and
Larue Smith are the former fresh
men who should .show well in the
varsity competition.

Plans are now being formulated
for the biennial barnstorming tour
which was inaugurated in 1932 when
Coach Bunn took his squad of ten
men as far east as Kansas. This
year's trip will be similar to the last
with the exception that the Stanford
mentor may make arrangements to
play Northwestern on the eastern
university's courts.
