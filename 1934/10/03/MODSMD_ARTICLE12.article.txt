# Radios Screech; Plaster Falls as Frosh Arrive
## 
### One of Them 
Nearly 000 freshmen and entering
sophomores roared in the bull pen,
strung networks of lights in Encina
rooms, pasted pictures of THE girls
on student-scarred walls, and other
wise proceeded to make themselves
at home as Stanford's famed lower
division dormitory opened for busi
ness Sunday.
Shiny new floors were scuffed by
collegiate feet and fresh plaster met
the onslaught of hammer and nail,
but Encina of last year was essen
tially the same as always.
Jim Triolo, sponsor at Encina in
charge of rehabilitation work, flung
open the doors after only the most
necessary bits of repair had been
made. "We fixed what had to be
fixed," he said. "Unfortunately, we
couldn't make any improvement as
striking as the'lobby which was re
finished last year."
But as students voiced the peren
nial cries of protest against living
conditions, unmistakable evidence
appeared that Encina was over
crowded, more this year than ever
before.
B, A. Gage, custodian of the hall,

I had little to say when confronted '
with evidence of conditions. "I know :
Encina has many students this term, j
Whether it has more or less than in
previous years I can't say, as our |
hall records are not yet complete."
But Encina roomers were sure j
that this year Encina was more used 1
than ever before. The logical bases
of their contention are the official
enrollment figures as released from ,
the Registrar's office, which reveal j
that 144!) men registered on Monday,
lower division registration day.
From the noise, residents are sure a
good majority must live in Encina.
Radios and high spirits of frosh re- |
I leased from home surveillance made j
the nights noisy, keeping the would- j
be sleepers awake. One freshman
making up , for the night before
basked on the lawn fronting Encina.
1"I can't rave about my room," he
said, "but, O Boy, the climate."
Another, who tossed on his hard cot
to the rhythms of a dance hand from
an adjoining room, was resigned, I
philosophically saying, "My mother
: didn't send me here to sleep, any-
I way."
