# Mann Teams Threaten Indians' Position
## COUGAR, WEBFOOT ELEVENS LOOM AS TITLE PROSPECTS U.S.F. Also Shows Strength In Early Contests 
### 
The two Saturdays of the 1934
football season which are now his
tory have not only upset the dope
bucket in the usual fashion but, of
greatest interest to Stanford fans,
have brought to the fore several
teams which loom as challengers to
the Card varsity on the top rung of
Ihe Coast ladder, gained through
wins over both California and U.S.C.
lust season.
Three teams seem to be stronger
than post-season dope indicated —
Santa Clara, Washington State, and
the University of San Francisco.
California and Stanford seem to have
lived up to advance hopes, although
their final strength cannot, of course,
be judged at this early date.
Santa Clara Gains
Oregon State, University of
Southern California, and U.C.L.A.
have disappointed in their perform
ances to date, while the strength of
the St. Mary's 1934 eleven can hardly
be judged by their one game, against
Ihe weak Columbia eleven of Ore
gon.
Stanford fans are all too conscious
of the great and underestimated gain
made by Santa Clara over their
somewhat ragged showing during
1933. Santa Clara was doped to give
the Big Rod Machine plenty of op
position and had its share of backers
before the game. But few could
withhold exclamations of surprise at
the series of polished and hard-run
ning backtields that Clipper Smith
sent on the field.
lironc Sophs Star
The bulk of the power and drive
which Santa Clara showed during
the afternoon was supplied by a
first-class group of sophomores, up
from the frosh with the reputation as
one of the toughest squads of first
year football men ever to be seen on
the Mission campus.
"Patches" Thomas and Nello Fa
laschi will become familiar to coast
football fans before this season is
out, and should aid Santa Clara in
realizing at last a win over their arch
rival, St. Mary's.
Cougars Show Power
Washington State's 1934 squad was
said to be the best ever had by Coach
Babe Hollingberry after last spring's
practice, and Saturday the Pullman
boys upheld this prediction by lick
ing Montana 27-0, a team over which
they eked out a rather lucky one
touchdown win in 1933.

the supposedly choice teams of the
present season, Oregon State, Sar

to be more than a "breather" for
the Cards on the 20th of this month

The two Saturdays of the 1934
football season which are now his
tory have not only upset the dope
bucket in the usual fashion but, of
greatest interest to Stanford fans,
have brought to the fore several
teams which loom as challengers to
the Card varsity on the top rung of
Ihe Coast ladder, gained through
wins over both California and U.S.C.
lust season.
Three teams seem to be stronger
than post-season dope indicated —
Santa Clara, Washington State, and
the University of San Francisco.
California and Stanford seem to have
lived up to advance hopes, although
their final strength cannot, of course,
be judged at this early date.
Santa Clara Gains
Oregon State, University of
Southern California, and U.C.L.A.
have disappointed in their perform
ances to date, while the strength of
the St. Mary's 1934 eleven can hardly
be judged by their one game, against
Ihe weak Columbia eleven of Ore
gon.
Stanford fans are all too conscious
of the great and underestimated gain
made by Santa Clara over their
somewhat ragged showing during
1933. Santa Clara was doped to give
the Big Rod Machine plenty of op
position and had its share of backers
before the game. But few could
withhold exclamations of surprise at
the series of polished and hard-run
ning backtields that Clipper Smith
sent on the field.
lironc Sophs Star
The bulk of the power and drive
which Santa Clara showed during
the afternoon was supplied by a
first-class group of sophomores, up
from the frosh with the reputation as
one of the toughest squads of first
year football men ever to be seen on
the Mission campus.
"Patches" Thomas and Nello Fa
laschi will become familiar to coast
football fans before this season is
out, and should aid Santa Clara in
realizing at last a win over their arch
rival, St. Mary's.
Cougars Show Power
Washington State's 1934 squad was
said to be the best ever had by Coach
Babe Hollingberry after last spring's
practice, and Saturday the Pullman
boys upheld this prediction by lick
ing Montana 27-0, a team over which
they eked out a rather lucky one
touchdown win in 1933.
By thoroughly decisioning one oi
the supposedly choice teams of the
present season, Oregon State, Sar

pleased the Don backers and loom
