# TANK MEN DEFEND CONFERENCE TITLE IN SHORT SEASON
## Water Polo Team To Guard 21-Year Supremacy 
### 
Stanford's 1934 varsity water polo
| team will start a hard 12-game
schedule October 17 when the Lake
j side Athletic Club comes to Encina
pools for a night game. Two days
; later U.C.L.A. will engage the In
dians in the first of a pair of tussles.
As the Cards are defending cham
! pions in both the Northern California
Water Polo League and the Pacific-
Coast Intercollegiate Conference,
they will naturally be the team to
| beat. U.C.L.A., California, U.S.C.,
; and the Olympic Club will all have
I dangerous outfits this fall.
Two innovations this year in the
j aquatic sport consist of the home-
I and-home arrangement of games and
! the shortening of the' season. For-
I merly the title was decided by the
; results of the Minor Sports Carnival,
I and the schedule ran through the
| winter as well as the fall. The last
: contest on the 1934 schedule will be
j that against California on Decem
j ber 1.
Veterans returning include Cap
' tain Leo Cook, Vlad Taranik, Jim
Benet, Bob Foster, and Jim Triolo,
forwards; Wally Wiget and Bill
Woodard, guards. Stars from the
| 1933 frosh septet include Ben Voss,
j Alec MacKenzie, Bob Eticnne, and
Bob Hoover, forwards; Bob Harris,
| "Pat" Pearson, Martin Scatena, and
Don Peterson, guards; and Bob
: Haslachc-r and Jack Scharlin, goalies.
Having gone through 21 seasons
1 with only one defeat at the hands of
a Coast college, the Indians are
to protect their record. A hectic
j overtime setback, 5 to 4, at the hands
jof U.S.C. two years ago was the
I lone set-back.
