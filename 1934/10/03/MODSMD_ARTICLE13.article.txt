# ATTENDANCE ON FARM TOPS ALL FORMER MARKS
## First Two Days Bring 3599 Students; 1024 Co-eds Set New Record 
### 
Shattering all previous records, 1
including those of boom as well as J
depression years, 3599 embryonic, i
and returning students made checks j
payable to Stanford University and
got on the boat for Fall quarter in
the two opening days of registration, j
The previous registration day high
of 3513 students, attained in 1930, i
was well topped by the 3599 1934
fall registrees, and the 1933 total of
3287 Cardinal supporters was left
far in the dust.
Although the 1934 registration has
not reached the 1930 fall all-quarter
high of 3606 students, late registra- 1
tions are expected to .send the grand j
total well above the highest records'
and far beyond the fondest expecta- j
tions of the administration.
Increase in the number of women ]
from the unprecedented number of j
787 in 1933 to 1024 was the largest i
factor contributing to the record- j
breaking registration of 3599 for this J
fall, although the number of men |
showed a material increase from 2500 j
to 2575. The admission of more worn- j
en, breaking the old tradition of the i
"500" has decreased the ratio of men
to women from stol to 2 1 /fe to 1.
These registration figures con
trast sharply with the approximate j
500 who registered on the Univer- j
sity's first registration day, October !
1, 1891. Even that figure was larger
than had been expected by Senator i
and Mrs. Stanford and the Univer- I
sity's president, David Starr Jordan.
