# HANDBALL TOURNAMENT COMPUTED IN SUMMER OF VARIED SPORT ACTIVITIES
## 
### 
A summer of rather intense activ
ity in which a record was estab- '
lished in completing an intramural
tournament was the sport menu at
Stanford last quarter.
Surmounting the lethargy which
usually stamps out the handball and j
tennis matches before a champion is .
crowned, the handball tournament
was finished; while the tennis pair- j
ings reached the last round, Robert
Pommer and Tlcl Lilienthal failing
to play off after whipping a strong
field.
Travelling athletes were numerous
visitors to the campus early in the
year — the swimming team of A1
Vande Weghe, Jack Medica, and Art
Highland, and Harvard's baseball
team stopping for short stays. Bud
Brown, former captain of a U.S.C.
swim team, dropped in for a visit j
at Encina pools. Coaches Nort
Thornton and Ernie Brandsten were
hosts to the swimmers and their
coaches, who were en route to
Japan; while the B.A.C. entertained
the party from Harvard, transporting
them around the San Francisco
strike area and housing them at j
Branner Hall July 17 and 18.
First signs of professional football :
in California became evident when
Jay Todd revealed an offer to join
a team of ex-Stanford players.
In mid-summer word reached the
campus from the High Sierras that
five Stanfordites—Ed Taaffe, John
Cahill, Charles Burkett, Bud Maples,
and Neil Ruge were distinguishing :
themselves in the sport of mountain j

climbing, having ascended Lyell and
McClure peaks in Yosemite Na
tional Park.
In early August Professor Black
welder led his geology class on a
week-end trip of hiking and field
study in Yosemite. They visited little
Yosemite Valley and viewed rock
formations.
Late in the month the Salinas
Rodeo beckoned many sportsmen
and all returned, reporting a great
show.
All durin gthe summer season, and
in a particularly intensive manner
toward the close. Vlad Taranik, Leo
Cook, Coach Thornton and others
worked in informal water polo prac
tice against pick-up teams, in prepa
ration for water polo's first season
as an independent sport this fall.
