# POWERFUL SQUAD POINTING FOR BIG 1935 NET SEASON
## Stars May Return Stanford To Tennis Supremacy 
### Irvin Jorgensen 
It's going to be a "Back to the
Farm"' year in tennis this year with i
Stanford's coming stars, Sammy Lee,
Johnny Law, Ben Dey, Bill Seward, j
and Jack Lynch, pointing to a re- l
turn to the position in the tennis
firmament the Farm occupied when
such tennis greats as Phil Neer,
Keith Gledhill, and Joe Coughlin
played for the Cardinal forces.
The Intercollegiate tennis tourna
ment at the Merion Cricket Club in
Pennsylvania seemed like Stanford
old home week for many years, as
the Stanford men cannon-balled
their way to the finals. But last year
Stafford was not even represented
when U.S.C.'s Gene Mako walloped
Jack Tidball of U.C.L.A. to win the
title. The raised eyebrows inti
mated that the Cardinal was slip
ping.
Already Favored
But happy days are here again.
Stanford may not produce the win
ner of the next Intercollegiate, but 1
the five stars of Stanford's constella- ]
lion makes them the favorite to run
off with the Coast Conference cup.
Who the number one man will be i
may not be decided until next year. I
Tennis practice during the fall
quarter is "strictly informal," and
ladder matches may not determine
the head man.
Ranking a Toss-up
It would be difficult to forecast
who among the live men is going
to be this number one star. Right
now, Sammy Lee, who won the In
tercollegiate doubles title with
Coughlin in 1933, reigns the favorite.
Lee was injured in an automobile
accident at the start of the last sea
son and was unable to play. He has
the most experience in college com
petition of any man on the squad.
But any of the up-and-coming
five may take him. If power-house I
Johnny Law ever finds his game he'll
be a hard man to beat. This boy
scorches the asphalt with the little
white pills. He drives with a hard
right fo the midsection and his serve
pounds over the net with the speed
of a gal heading for Roble to avoid
a lockout. But he doesn't always
know his own strength, and a softer
stroking but more consistent player
can often take him.
Sophs Are Good
Coming up with a rush from the
Frosh team are the two phenoms,
Ben Dey and Bill Seward. These two
men have the smoothest game in
the school. More polished than their
brethren, their game is particularly
pretty to watch for the ease and
finesse of their movements.
Dey and Seward have see-sawed
back and forth in their contests, with
lean and whip-like Dey being more
consistently the victor. Either of
these two men may take the two
veterans.
Lynch Highly Toulcml
Somewhat of an unknown quan
tity, but coming to Stanford with an
enviable reputation is Jack Lynch,
former junior champ of the United |
States. A transfer from T;.ft Jun
ior College, Lynch has been trying
for a long time Lo enter the home of
"Die Luft Ner Freheht Wc-ht," but
has been unable to make the grade
and grades until this year.
Other places on the team will be
hotly contested. Danny Clark, Law's
teammate at L.A. High and on the j
freshman team of two ye;irs ago. j
was number five man last year and |
improving rapidly. Bob Pommer, in- ,
eligible for last year's Frosh team i
because of scholastic reasons, is a
former California junior champ in |
his own right and will probably be
fißhting for a good position.
This year's Frosh team may not i
compare with last year's flashes, and
then again, it may. Bob Underwood
and Bill Braley, rated very high in
Southern California tennis circles, j
have reported for duty already, wnile
other prep school stars are expected
to sign up.

ment at the Merion Cricket Club in
Pennsylvania seemed like Stanford
old home week for many years, as
the Stanford men cannon-balled
their way to the finals. But last year
Stafford was not even represented
when U.S.C.'s Gene Mako walloped
Jack Tidball of U.C.L.A. to win the
title. The raised eyebrows inti
mated that the Cardinal was slip
ping.
Already Favored
But happy days are here again.
Stanford may not produce the win
ner of the next Intercollegiate, but 1
the five stars of Stanford's constella- ]
lion makes them the favorite to run
off with the Coast Conference cup.
Who the number one man will be i
may not be decided until next year. I
Tennis practice during the fall
quarter is "strictly informal," and
ladder matches may not determine
the head man.
Ranking a Toss-up
It would be difficult to forecast
who among the live men is going
to be this number one star. Right
now, Sammy Lee, who won the In
tercollegiate doubles title with
Coughlin in 1933, reigns the favorite.
Lee was injured in an automobile
accident at the start of the last sea
son and was unable to play. He has
the most experience in college com
petition of any man on the squad.
But any of the up-and-coming
five may take him. If power-house I
Johnny Law ever finds his game he'll
be a hard man to beat. This boy
scorches the asphalt with the little
white pills. He drives with a hard
right fo the midsection and his serve
pounds over the net with the speed
of a gal heading for Roble to avoid
a lockout. But he doesn't always
know his own strength, and a softer
stroking but more consistent player
can often take him.
Sophs Are Good
Coming up with a rush from the
Frosh team are the two phenoms,
Ben Dey and Bill Seward. These two
men have the smoothest game in
the school. More polished than their
brethren, their game is particularly
pretty to watch for the ease and
finesse of their movements.
Dey and Seward have see-sawed
back and forth in their contests, with
lean and whip-like Dey being more
consistently the victor. Either of
these two men may take the two
veterans.
Lynch Highly Toulcml
Somewhat of an unknown quan
tity, but coming to Stanford with an
enviable reputation is Jack Lynch,
former junior champ of the United |
States. A transfer from T;.ft Jun
ior College, Lynch has been trying
for a long time Lo enter the home of
"Die Luft Ner Freheht Wc-ht," but
has been unable to make the grade
and grades until this year.
Other places on the team will be
hotly contested. Danny Clark, Law's
teammate at L.A. High and on the j
freshman team of two ye;irs ago. j
was number five man last year and |
improving rapidly. Bob Pommer, in- ,
eligible for last year's Frosh team i
because of scholastic reasons, is a
former California junior champ in |
his own right and will probably be
fißhting for a good position.
This year's Frosh team may not i
compare with last year's flashes, and
then again, it may. Bob Underwood
and Bill Braley, rated very high in
Southern California tennis circles, j
have reported for duty already, wnile
other prep school stars are expected
to sign up.
It's going to be a "Back to the
Farm"' year in tennis this year with i
Stanford's coming stars, Sammy Lee,
Johnny Law, Ben Dey, Bill Seward, j
