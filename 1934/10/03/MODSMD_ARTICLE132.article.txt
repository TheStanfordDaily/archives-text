# POWERFUL SQUAD POINTING FOR BIG 1935 NET SEASON
## Stars May Return Stanford To Tennis Supremacy 
### Irvin Jorgensen 
It's going to be a "Back to the
Farm"' year in tennis this year with i
Stanford's coming stars, Sammy Lee,
Johnny Law, Ben Dey, Bill Seward, j
and Jack Lynch, pointing to a re- l
turn to the position in the tennis
firmament the Farm occupied when
such tennis greats as Phil Neer,
Keith Gledhill, and Joe Coughlin
played for the Cardinal forces.
The Intercollegiate tennis tourna
ment at the Merion Cricket Club in
Pennsylvania seemed like Stanford
old home week for many years, as
the Stanford men cannon-balled
their way to the finals. But last year
Stafford was not even represented
when U.S.C.'s Gene Mako walloped
Jack Tidball of U.C.L.A. to win the
title. The raised eyebrows inti
mated that the Cardinal was slip

Already Favored
But happy days are here again.
Stanford may not produce the win
ner of the next Intercollegiate, but 1
the five stars of Stanford's constella- ]
lion makes them the favorite to run
off with the Coast Conference cup.
Who the number one man will be i
may not be decided until next year. I
Tennis practice during the fall
quarter is "strictly informal," and
ladder matches may not determine
the head man.
Ranking a Toss-up
It would be difficult to forecast
who among the live men is going
to be this number one star. Right
now, Sammy Lee, who won the In
tercollegiate doubles title with
Coughlin in 1933, reigns the favorite.
Lee was injured in an automobile
accident at the start of the last sea
son and was unable to play. He has
the most experience in college com
petition of any man on the squad.
But any of the up-and-coming
five may take him. If power-house I
Johnny Law ever finds his game he'll
be a hard man to beat. This boy
scorches the asphalt with the little
white pills. He drives with a hard
right fo the midsection and his serve
pounds over the net with the speed
of a gal heading for Roble to avoid
