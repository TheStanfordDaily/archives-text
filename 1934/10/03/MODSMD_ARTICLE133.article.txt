STILL ON SPOT
BUT ODDS CLOSER
The Indians are still on a spot
but the odds have narrowed.
That is the outlook two weeks aftei
the start of football practice, anc
after most Pacific Coast teams havt
played two or more games.
Santa Clara is at least partiall>
responsible for the shortening ol
odds on Stanford for the season
The "beating," which was really
only a 7-7 tie, administered last
Saturday by the Broncos, establishes
the supposedly invincible Cardinal
machine as entirely mortal, but
shows very little else.
COULD HAPPEN
TO ANYONE
The Broncos were good, and the
Indians were awfully tired about
the start of the fourth quarter,
The slight lack in condition told, as
the game was played in a heat wave
rivalling the Midwe.st drouth.
The upset deadlock may be con
strued in many ways as a material
aid to Stanford's chances. Because
of it. the fans are going to forget
their enthusiasm concerning Tiny
Thornhill's squad just a little, and
they will begin to think that, after
all, maybe all this talk about Cali
fornia and a few other schools has
a basis.
MAY HURT ROSE
HOWL CHANCES
So, although the Redskins are still
in the limelight and the target lor
every Coast team, the light is just
a shade less brilliant, and the point
ing is just a bit less severe.
On the other hand, at the end of
the season when a Rose Bowl con
tender is chosen, a little tie to mar
the Cardinal records may hurt. Be
cause Stanford got the call last year,
if any two or three teams have a
record of performances for 1934 that
are approximately equal to that of
Thornhill's men, Stanford is apt to
be discarded from consideration.
SHOWED POWER
IN FIRST HALF
With the exception of endurance,
Stanford showed everything last
Saturday. During the first half, the
Cardinal attack and defense were
both practically (lawless. In three
full quarters, Santa Clara made but
six yards from scrimmage, did not
register a first down, and did not
complete a forward pass.
Stanford pushed through almost
at will offensively, batted down
Bronco passes with precision, and
looked every inch the team that had
formerly been mentioned as the best
<»n the Coast.
INDIANS SHOULD
BEAT OREGON STATE
The Santa Clara game will be dis
carded by experts as they pick
Stanford to defeat Oregon State this
week-end in her coast conference
opener. This writer goes farther and
.sayt> the Indians will win at Portland
by two touchdowns or more, barring
that nasty northwestern habit of
raining.
San Francisco University showed
th.'n .elves superior to the Webfeet
last Friday with a 10 to 0 victory.
Of course, maybe the Dons will also
prove themselves better than Stan
ford in three weeks. But predictions,
or rather guesses, concerning this
game will come later.
SOMETHING WRONG
DOWN LA. WAY
What's the dope on that Trojan -
College of the Pacific game in the
Colliseum last week? It might mean
anything. In the. first place, Amos
Alonzo Stagg, the grand old man of
football, by the medium of his Pa
cific Bengals, held El Trojan to a
meager six-point victory.
Pacific, to all intents and purposes,
is about in the same class as San
Jose State and Nevada. Could it be
that C.O.P. is really that much bet
ter than other Far Western Confer
once schools this season? Or is
U.S.C. so much worse than usual that
a second rate team can nearly beat
her? Oi - was it just a fluke?
IT DOESN'T
MAKE SENSE
None of these explanations sound
particularly plausible. There is an
other alternative—that Howard Jones
has decided to baffle the country by
putting on an act depicting weak
ness. Considering Mr. Jones, this
hardly sounds right, either. Well,
time will tell.
A few other puzzling incidents on
the Coast seem on the surface to alter
early predictions. Oregon, co-cham
pions of the conference with Stan

ford last year, astounded the West
with a very much unexpected 26 to
3 rout of a supposedly strong
U.C.L.A. Bruin squad. You figure
it out.
Washington, the dark horse squad,
had a hard time in administering a
13 to 0 defeat to Idaho in a set-up
game. The half score was 0 to 0. All
of which may mean that a few
other schools are having a hard time
hitting their stride. —Browne.
