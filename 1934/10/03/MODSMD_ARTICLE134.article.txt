# Lawson Little Eligible for Golf Here This Year
## BRITISH, AMERICAN CHIP WILL HEAD CARDINAL VARSITY Qualifications Start Today In Local Ladder Play 
### 
Defying the precedent set last year,
Coach Eddie Twiggs announced yes
terday that Lawson Little, Stanford's
international amateur golf champion,
would be seeded in the number one
position of the team for the 1934-35
golf season.
Though he has not registered as
yet, Little is expected to check in
some time later in the week. Shortly
after he won the amateur ha made it
known that he intended to return to
Stanford to complete his course of
study.
It is possible that his return may
be retarded by slight injuries that
he suffered in an automobile accident
while touring Canada with Chick
Evans, Johnny Goodman, and C.
Ross "Sandy" Summerville. Little,
Evans, and Goodman were pinned
under his car which capsized an hour
before Summerville, who was fol
lowing them in another car, was able
to release them. The accident oc
curred just after they left Toronto,
Ontario, where they played an ex
hibition match.
Qualify This Week
Though Little is outstanding, there
are several others who will be able
to give him a great race in the ladder
matches to be played during the
year. Qualifying for the lesser po
sitions on the team will begin today
and continue until next Tuesday,
which is the final day.
Of those who will play for the
chance to challenge Little perhaps
the most outstanding is Verne "Spec"
Stewart. Stewart's midwest campaign
brought great notice to Stanford's
golf. During the summer in the
Western Amateur he was a semi
finalist, reaching that position by de
feating the veteran "Chick" Evans,
former amateur champion, in the
quarter-finals.
Later in the summer, in Denver,
scene of Little's earlier triumphs,
he put two 69's together to become
medalist in the National Amateur
Golf Tournament. His performance,
coupled with Little's, gave Stanford
the medalist and the winner of the
championship.
Hoerner Is Threat
Fighting with Stewart for the po
sition will be two other golfers who
have great records. More prominent
of the two is Jack Hoerner, who
won the Nebraska State Amateur
during the summer and advanced to
the fourth round of the LJ.S. Ama
teur.
Threatening Stewart and Hoerner
every hole of the qualifying play
will be Don Edwards, who was run
ner-up in the California State Ama
teur, played at the Peeble Beach
course. He lost on the thirty-sixth
hole to Stuart Hawley, graduate s'.u
dent at Stanford. Edwards was also
runner-up in the Orinda invitational
tournament this summer.
An uncertain quantity in any golf
qualifying, Dan Moser, Edwards' ne
misis at Orinda, may make things
hot for everyone on the upper rungs
of the ladder.
Mingling with those up from last
year's freshman team will be the
veterans, Bill Hoelle, Bob Thomp
son, Tom Dwyer, Ray Freer, Hugh
Mellon, Morse Erskine, and Bud So
phian. Any or all of these men may
make the grade but fighting them
every hole of play will be the former
freshmen headed by Mack Stoddard,
George Berkey, King Brown, Dalton
Henderson, Howard Clark, and Bob
Welch.
