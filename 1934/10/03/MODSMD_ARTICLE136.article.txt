## 
### 
With only Chuck Nimmo return
ing from last year's team, cross
country chances against California

team easily defeated the Bears last
fall, in a morning preliminary to the
Big Game, on the local golf course.
Captain Norman Bright, Art Aze
vedo, Dave Devlin, Ol lie Amdahl,
and Jim Ferrie, plus Nimmo, over
whelmed the Bears, and the first five
have already consumed three years
of track competition. Bright and
possibly one or tv/o others returning
to school may bo allowed to run
through revised eligibility rules
made specially for the sport.
Up from the frosh come Captain
Rusty Marsh, Bob Alexander, Bill
McCurdy, and Max Schiferl. March
can run any distance, and is good
enough to stick fairly close to Nim
mo. Alexander and McCurdy are a
pair of fast half-milers, and may
not choose to tour the long distance
which amounts to about five miles.
