# PROSPECTS AVERAGE FOR INDIAN FENCERS
## 
### 
With only two members of last
year's varsity returning, and another
man from the team of two years ago
back in school, prospects for this
! year's fencing team are neither dis
couraging nor especially bright, ac
cording to Elwyn Bugge, fencing
coach. Al Snyder and Ed Munger,
the tv/o most consistent performers
| last season, are both graduated.
Dwight Strong and Oliver Bowen
are the two returning from the 1933
squad, and Jimmy Dole, who was
one of the mainstays of the squad a
few years ago, is again enrolled.
Varsity practice, under coaches
Maloney and Bugge, will be held
every Tuesday and Thursday at 11
o'clock. Extensive practice sessions
will be held in an attempt to uncover
and develop new material.
Very few men have signed up for
frosh fencing, and more are needed.
No experience is necessary.
