# TIGERS, CARDINALS PLAT FIRST GAME OF SERIES TODAY
## Dean, Rowe Probably Will Pitch in Opener 
### 
DETROIT, Oct. 2 (/P).â€”'The an
inual hysteria known to the national
j pastime as the world series rocked
| Detroit again for the first time in 25
1 years today as Mickey Coehrane's
Tigers and the city as well whirled
j about to face the old familiar St.
Louis Cardinals, headed by the new
baseball heroes, the brothers Dean.
The Cards, with rubber-armed
I Dizzy Dean roaring in the van, and
his l'il brother Paul silently nodding
assent, aren't due into the motor
vehicle capital until tomorrow from
St. Louis, where their last ditch
j comeback against the Reds finally
\ decided the National League cham
pionship when the Giants broke up
; in the face of the indignant Dodgers.
First Game Tomorrow
But tonight, though the battle call
J doesn't sound for the first time until
i Wednesday afternoon, the faithful
' were staggering around on their
heels from the excitement of the
| first world series here since 1909, the
1 first between two Western clubs
since the White Sox scandal of 1919,
the arguments over the possible
j starting pitchers, and the battle for
seats.
Odds were still even money today.
There were all kinds of rumors
| that the rival master minds, Frankie
| Frisch and Cochrane, would top off
i their first full seasons at the helm
! with some fancy two-handed jug
| gling.
Rowe Should Start
Similarly there seemed no other
choice for Frisch than to put the
Tigers from the start on a rigid diet
I of Deans, starting with "Dizzy," fol-
I lowing with Paul, and repeating the
dose as long as possible.
May Start Crowder
But Cochrane, raised in the master
minding school of Connie Mack,
i might lead toward a surprise maneu-
I ver and start Alvin Crowder, as he
i did in the crucial series with the
i Yankees this year.
I "I won't decide until the last min
! ute," was all Mickey would say
| about it.
Similarly there was considerable
! food for thought in the possibility
| that Frisch might cross the boys and
j start his crafty veteran of former
Cardinal series triumphs, "Wild Bill"
{ Hallahan, on the opening day, figur
i ing that the advantage gained in a
surprise victory there would leave
j the astounded Bengals set up for the
speed of the lanky, fireball furies.
