# "BIG FOUR" RUGBY TEAMS MAY JOIN FORCES FOR TOUR
## All-Star Squad Proposed For Trip to Canada 
### 
A proposal that a team of rugby
stars from the "big lour," Stanford,
California, U.C.L.A., and U.S.C., be
sent to British Columbia for a se
ries of three games has been sub
mitted to the graduate managers of
those institutions by Harry Maloney,
director of minor sports.
The proposition is that live men
from each university and a coach
and manager be selected to make
the trip. The players will be se
lected by the coaches, and the coach
and manager by the graduate man
agers.
The series will be of the "homc
and-home" variety, with three games
in the North and four in California
two in Los Angeles and two here;
the games being played mid-week
and Saturday. Two games would be
in Vancouver and one in Victoria.
Financial arrangements call for
in advancement of $500 by each in
stitution and the British Columbia
Rugby Union to defray expenses of
the teams. The gate receipts would
be pooled and all expenses paid.
After that the remaining money
would be divided between the
B.C.R.U. and the four universities.
Maloney has letters from the grad
uate managers and from the presi
dents of Stanford and California, all
of which speak highly of the pro
posed scheme. U.S.C. and California
mentioned finance as a matter of
great importance, while U.C.L.A.
thought "that picking the team would
be difficult.
Other matters at present under
consideration are proposed games
with Japanese institutions and some
Eastern school, probably Yale. These
latter schemes are still in the "prob
lematical" stage, but Japan sent
notice that although they were out
of money at present, they would be
very glad to play Stanford and would
place her at the top of the list for
next year.
