# Art Courses Included In Many Departments
## 
### 
A number of courses are being
i offered in various departments this
j fall which together constitute a
1 group in Art and Archaeology. Some
]of these courses are: History of
Greece, History of Architecture and
Furnishings, Portrait and Caricature,
1 Psychological Approaches to Aes
i thetics, and Introduction to the Ap
-1 preciation of Art. -
Some confusion usually arises from
j the fact that the courses are not
| listed under the heading of Art and
I Archaeology, but under the different
' departments whose members give the
i courses. Nevertheless, the courses
are general in nature and not con
j fined to departmental topics.
