# Announce Two Changes In Physics Curriculum
## 
### 
Two changes in the physics de
partment schedule have been an
nounced. Physics 171, Kinetic Theory
of Gases, scheduled for Monday
Wednesday and Friday at fl o'clock,
has been cancelled. There will be
given in its place Physics 171*. Ther
modynamics, which will meet for the
first time this morning at 11 o'clock
in room 404.
The first meeting of the class in
Physics 231. Quantum Mechanics,
will be held tomorrow morning at
10 o'clock in room 390.
At these classes, both of which are
given by Professor Bloch, the mem
bers will decide when regular meet
ings will be scheduled.
