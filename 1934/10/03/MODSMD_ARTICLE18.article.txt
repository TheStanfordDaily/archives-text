# Play Head Decides on Production
## "One Sunday Afternoon" To Be Given First 
### 
After a stormy session, Dramatic
Council last night named "'One Sun
day Afternoon" as its November 2
production, with tryouts to start im
mediately.
"She Loves Me Not," recently
filmed by the famed Bing Crosby,
and "Goodbye Again," were also un
der consideration for final choice, but
were voted down by a large major
ity.
The play is from the ppn of James
Hagan, veteran playwright. Gary
Cooper starred in the celluloid ver
sion, which was released several
years ago. Its box office records
guarantee high entertainment value,
says Manager Uick Frank.
Students Eligible
Tryouts begin tonight, with all
University students eligible with the
sole exception of freshman women.
Those wishing a part in the pro
duction are afforded an opporutnity
to display their artistic talents at
7:15 tonight in the Little Theater.
Second tryouts occur tomorrow
afternoon at 4:15 and at 7:15 tomor
row evening, also in the Little The
ater.
Nineteen parts in all comprise the
past of "One Sunday Afternoon."
The main burden of action falls upon
four principal characters, with strong
supporting parts.
Timmins Directs
Especially notable is the fact that
the play is the first presented under
the direction of Stanford's new dra
matics head, Edward Murray Tim
mins, who replaces Harold Helven
ston, now on sabbatical leave. Tim
mins possesses an enviable imputa
tion in the field of drama, and will
undoubtedly introduce new methods
of staging and supervision.
The dramatics managerial staff at
present has several vacancies, an
nounces Manager Frank. Tryouts
are now in progress. Those wishing
to enroll are asked 1o call at Frank's
office in the Old Union any after
noon this week for an interview.
They may obtain a position on the
staff, and may eventually be con
i sidered for the managerial post.
Men and women are both eligible.
Development Novel
The play is novel, in that it is de
veloped by the flash-back method.
Modern days, and the costumes and
mannerisms of the Gay Nineties
each have their place.
Four scenes in ail comprise the
i play. Three elaborate interiors, be
! sides one exterior, will make stag
i ing and setting the most pretentious
| for several years. Large enrollment
i in dramatic classes insures a large
stage crew to handle the technical
arrangements.
The Stanford production of "One
Sunday Afternoon" will be the first
jon the Coast. Although the play
J had a long run in New York, it has
never been presented on a Califor
nia stage.
