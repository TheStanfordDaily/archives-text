# Committee Ends Year With Sneak
## Final Meet Celebrated At Dinner Dance 
### 
One of the most charming affairs
of the delightful social season was
the entertaining business meeting
of last year's Ex Committee in a
beautiful dining and dancing room
of a San Francisco hotel, the night
of June 13.
While Stanford grad Griff pounded
the ivories and the giddy dancers
glided by in a gay stream, the re
tiring Ex Committee consumed $45
worth of cover charge and meals and
considered the multifarious problems
of the Associated Students of Stan
ford University.
Adding to the bizarre touch of the
exotic affair was the delicate note
that all was not strictly legal about
the party. In the A.S.S.U. Constitu
tion there is a little statement which
says Ex Committee meetings must be
held during the school year, while
the "Ex Committee Sneak" was after
midnight of the last day of school.
Lyman Wields Gavel
Vice - president Johnny Lyman
wielded the gavel in the absence of
Jerry Trautman; Miriam Kropp, sec
retory, was there but she forgot her
pencil and paper. This ruled out
games of "tit-tat-to," and made it
necessary for Lyman to
what transpired and tell it to an
A.S.S.U. stenographer, so she could
write the minutes.
Undaunted, the fearless represent
atives of the people conducted the
business as it came. The Publica
tions Council had a serious objection
to the appearance of the freely dis
tributed note-book dividers. Just
then Stanford Indian Griff struck up
the band. "Aw, come on, let's dance,"
someone said over the undertones
of a trombone. "We can't talk over
the noise of the music." So off
danced the couples, engaged in gov
ernment business. With the music
over they wended their way back to
the tables.
Music Interrupts
I "Any discussion?" asked Lyman.
"We discussed it during the dance,"
the someone replied. And Joe Fes
sio and Ollie Amdahl were given the
right to contract for the note-book
divider.
In this music-interspersed man
ner business was transacted. A
member -at - large for the Union
Board of Governors was needed.
Someone suggested John Mottram.
Mottram rose to ask a question, but
he was made a member of the Union
Board of Governors before he had
a chance to speak. "Wh-wh-wh-at
IS the Union Board of Governors?"
is the question he asked.
Other business transacted: Law
son Little was granted a Block "S' !
for winning the Walker Cup match
es; Crompton Bangs, Stan Beaubaire,
and Marvin Kahn were appointed on
a committee to formulate a plan for
the Stanford Daily election; present
student body President Marvin Kahn
and Graduate Manager A1 Masters
were empowered to act for the Ex
ecutive Committee during the sum
mer quarter. The question of the
rooters' cap contracts was laid on
the table until new bids had been
received.

Mottram rose to ask a question, but
he was made a member of the Union
Board of Governors before he had
a chance to speak. "Wh-wh-wh-at
IS the Union Board of Governors?"
is the question he asked.
Other business transacted: Law
son Little was granted a Block "S' !
for winning the Walker Cup match
es; Crompton Bangs, Stan Beaubaire,
and Marvin Kahn were appointed on
a committee to formulate a plan for
the Stanford Daily election; present
student body President Marvin Kahn
and Graduate Manager A1 Masters
were empowered to act for the Ex
ecutive Committee during the sum
mer quarter. The question of the
rooters' cap contracts was laid on
the table until new bids had been
received.
One of the most charming affairs
of the delightful social season was
the entertaining business meeting
of last year's Ex Committee in a
beautiful dining and dancing room
of a San Francisco hotel, the night
of June 13.
While Stanford grad Griff pounded
the ivories and the giddy dancers
glided by in a gay stream, the re
tiring Ex Committee consumed $45
worth of cover charge and meals and
considered the multifarious problems
of the Associated Students of Stan
ford University.
Adding to the bizarre touch of the
exotic affair was the delicate note
that all was not strictly legal about
the party. In the A.S.S.U. Constitu
tion there is a little statement which
says Ex Committee meetings must be
held during the school year, while
the "Ex Committee Sneak" was after
midnight of the last day of school.
Lyman Wields Gavel
Vice - president Johnny Lyman
wielded the gavel in the absence of
Jerry Trautman; Miriam Kropp, sec
retory, was there but she forgot her
pencil and paper. This ruled out
games of "tit-tat-to," and made it
necessary for Lyman to
what transpired and tell it to an
A.S.S.U. stenographer, so she could
write the minutes.
Undaunted, the fearless represent
atives of the people conducted the
business as it came. The Publica
tions Council had a serious objection
to the appearance of the freely dis
tributed note-book dividers. Just
then Stanford Indian Griff struck up
the band. "Aw, come on, let's dance,"
someone said over the undertones
of a trombone. "We can't talk over
the noise of the music." So off
danced the couples, engaged in gov
ernment business. With the music
over they wended their way back to
the tables.
Music Interrupts
I "Any discussion?" asked Lyman.
"We discussed it during the dance,"
the someone replied. And Joe Fes
sio and Ollie Amdahl were given the
right to contract for the note-book
divider.
In this music-interspersed man
ner business was transacted. A
member -at - large for the Union
Board of Governors was needed.
