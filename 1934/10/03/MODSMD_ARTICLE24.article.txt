# On Agrarian Instincts

### 
Registration refolds toppled into the dust
yesterday as over 3(500 swarmed into the
Administration Building to see about spend
ing the winter season here upon the Farm.
So, "we're here." Stanford has changed a
good deal since the closing of spring quar
ter. An energetic building program has pro
vided many a* quip to put forth when con
versation is dull. The University gave the
Daily a new building, and the Daily is prop
erly thankful. Stress of competition and
perhaps a desire to aid the forgotten carpen
ter was responsible for many new rooms on
the How. And many will be happier for the
fact, when the ominous shadow of the game
known as "rushing" looms closer. Hut oth
ers will be sad, and can shrink behind older
walls.
For those who are new to Stanford's soil
and fashions of farming, there is much to
see and do, with adequate lime for the do
ing. Hull sessions will occupy a good many
evenings for the next several weeks, bull
sessions about people and things.
Lest they degenerate too rapidly into plain
animal sessions with much clawing and paw
ing of earth with the rich black dirt losing
much of its finer qualities, one remembers
the following:
The newcomer here will be told lots of
information about many things. He will be
on the receiving end of more advice than the
man who would like to borrow live dollars.
He will hear much about many people. Some
true, and some hearsay. Hut he will do best
to ligure most problems out on personal
knowledge, rather than pure talk.
At Stanford, one is friendly, and greets
friend and stranger alike on the campus with
a cheery '-hello," day or night, man or wom
an alike. If one hears something he doesn't
like, he doesn't repeat it behind his friend's
back. Instead he is more apt to settle the
thing point-blank, and avoid the mud-sling
ing that comes from rumors to the effect
that so-and-so is just that. Which removes
some of the "dirt" and we become less agra
rian for a while.
