SI:mlor<l expectations of an unbeaten, un
tied football record for the year went a
glirnmering Saturday to the rousing tune of'
7-7, hut on the whole, Cardinal rooters are
standing up to lake it with an admirable
attitude. As the politicians were saying two
years ago, "it might have been worse," and
there were even some veteran railhirds who
allowed that a sound licking would have been
the best thing in the world lor the Indians.
Well might that tie be wiped oil the boards
as merely a little early deflation of the cham
pionship hullabaloo that Stanford seems
doomed to be honored with every year on the
pre-season dope charts.
Santa Clara had the fastest, smoothest
club thai they have placed on the field here
in recent years, not excepting MKW when I hoy
were fresh from a waxing of the (iohlen
Hear.
So everything's fine and dandy. Coach
l inv, and we know that whatever the out
come be, the Hig Med Machine is going to
he worth watching.
