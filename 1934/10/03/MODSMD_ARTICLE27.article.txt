# in Which a Gauntlet Is Flung

### 
Ex Committee opened an auspicious sea
son last night with clean-cut, efficient action
on several fronts. Newly Conned Activities
Council today boasts of two-thirds member
ship complete, and appointments are re
portedly non-political, based upon merit
alone.
A 'cms, that weekly publication which
made its timely debut in these parts lust
spring, is again protruding a vigorous beagle
into the local newspaper market. With Kx
Committee taking a neutral stand, standing
rigidly "on guard" in the event of any un
foreseen developments, Sews receives official
sanction to distribute on the campus. Eth
ically speaking, perhaps, negative sympathy?
Sews is said to present much that this
newspaper cannot, or does not print. Them
days are behind us, and the taste of friendly
rivalry whets many an appetite.
Editorially, the Daily welcomes Sews to the
tribe. Next week's lirst issue may come out
on time. Who knows?
