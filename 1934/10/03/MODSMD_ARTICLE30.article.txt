While Washington's harassed F.D.R. con
tinues to smile bravely in the face of one of
the bitterest labor struggles in history, Wil
liam Green announces that he and other offi
cials of the American Federation of Labor
will "stand by" in Washington to "confer with
the President on his proposal for a period of
industrial peace."
Labor's chieftain says that he intends to
oiler "fullest co-operation" in settling the
present situation, but is determined not to
relinquish during the trial truce period a sin
gle advantage that labor has gained through
the NBA.
The forthcoming Washington Tea Party
promises much in the way of political edu
cation for the student of government, like
a game wherein the dealer oilers to play if
he can but retain a few of the aces iu his own
hand.
While government is faced with the greatest
number of strikes that any living man has
witnessed in this country, we look upon a
situation whereby that government offers in
effect a dole to those who relinquish the jobs
which they have.
If that is National Recovery Administration
and if that is sound business, economists will
do well to study Washington most carefully.
