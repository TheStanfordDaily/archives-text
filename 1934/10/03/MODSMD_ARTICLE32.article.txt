# In Which a Reviewer Expounds a Policy
## 
### 
II seems to the Reviewer that the "rah-rah
collegiate" spirit of last year's "Hack to the
Farm" movement has almost transformed
Stanford from "farm" into "country-club."
Of no import to us in itself, this change h;is,

however, forced the Review
er to do a little mctamorpho- ;
sizing of its own. Plainly,
we're going to give you the
kind of reviews you want,
short and to the point, with ;
concentrated effort bent
toward eliminating the pseu
do-intellectual custom of
"panning."
To facilitate this we're in
augurating a grading system, j
The drawing of the upraised
thumb, coupled with a re
view, attempts lo convey our J
re co m in en d a I i on. The
"thumbs down" figure car
ries its usual significance,
and the "little man" says,
"lake il or leave il, it's up lo
you-"
For the benefit of those
who liked the lone of the old

Reviewer we're introducing an even lonier
column to be known as "The Critic." Frankly
high-brow, The Critic will appear only in
weekly or bi-weekly splendor, in contrast to
its lower-nosed, daily companion strip. Only
special events or contributions will call it
forth from the austerity of its Parnassian lair.
The Critic, further, takes pleasure in an
nouncing as its New York correspondent,
Mr. .lames Sandoe. Mr. Sandoe's contribu
tions will give to the Daily the distinction of
being the sole Pacific Coast newspaper lo
have its own dramatic critic on Hroadwav.
