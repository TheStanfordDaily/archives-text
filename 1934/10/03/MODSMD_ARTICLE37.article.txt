# BULL SESSION
## YE WHO GRADUATE IN 1938 
### 
You have sailed up Palm Drive,
and thought the Chapel was "swell."
You have made your first "check
payable to Stanford University."
You have been deposited in among
the ageing stones and two-by-fours
that are Encina, and behind the ivy
colored walls of the Bastile that is
Roble. You have donned moleskins
and whatnot. And now you are
headed for classrooms on the Quad.
In short, you are of Stanford.
$ * *
Some of you have come here for
the very good reason that "Stanford
beat S.C. in '33." Some for the like
good reason that one no longer has
to be one-five-hundredth part of the
cream of collegiate femininity in
order to matriculate. Some are here
because Dad was a member of the
class of '14, or because Mother was
a Stanford Kappa. Some of you are
here because the family had $300,
and didn't know what else to do
with you. Some of you are undoubt
edly here because you earnestly de
sire a Stanford education.
* * *
All of you should realize that for
the present—whether you get four
years of Stanford education or just
four years at Stanford—it's all a
luxury, and a very expensive one.
In the wild scramble for Standard
Oil pumps and Woolworth clerk
ships, a Stanford diploma will be of
doubtful value. Although the bub
bling Alma Whitaker believes that
grocery stores are now showing a
preference for college graduates, it
is more than probable that the man
who has not come to college, but has
spent his four years working up from
the well-known bottom will have
more than a better chance of being
the Piggly - Wiggly cashier. And
even if this is not so, after four years
at Stanford you will not want to be
the cashier at Piggly-Wiggly.

Perhaps in 1938, when Upton Sin
clair has Ended Poverty In Califor

nia (EPIC), and water no longer
runs downhill, a Stanford sheepskin
will assure you of a job. Until the
millennium, however, the sheepskin
will be good only for wall decora
tions and bookmarks. Four years
at Stanford, however, can be worth
much more.
* * *
The very fact that the sheepskin
has no direct relation to the job
getting capacity of college graduates
should place more emphasis on the
luxury or cultural value of the Stan
ford education. The fact that you
and I are here, and not standing up
on our own two feet —in breadlines—
like a large part of America, should
make us prize the more the oppor
tunity to be served up with steam
ing hut dishes of history, philosophy,
and such.
* * *
A Stanford education is a luxury.
Cigarettes, bon-bons, and cham
pagne are also luxuries. But one
cannot complete the syllogism, for
the Stanford education is far better
than any of the others. Its flavor
lasts! —Dave MellinkolT
A 6,000-foot tower is planned at
Paris for the 1937 fair.
