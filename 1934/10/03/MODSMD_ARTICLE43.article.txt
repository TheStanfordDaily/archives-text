# Lee Presents Discussion of Grid Injuries
## Says Football Games Not Unduly Dangerous

"The whistle — the kickoff — the
catch! Two teams of husky athletes
crash. A diving body brings down a
flying runner. Prostrate figures dot
the field."
ft looks hazardous. But Dr. Rus
sel V. Lee, associate clinical instruc
tor of therapeutics in the School of
Medicine, tells you that it is really
not so bad as it looks. In his talk
on "The Causes of Football Inju
ries" during the Stanford University
hour, which is broadcast over KPO
at 7:45 every Monday evening, Dr.
Lee emphasized the point that the
nature of football itself makes a
certain number of injuries inevi
table, but that many more are hurt
than should be.
Dr. Lee listed several major causes
of football injuries. He believes that
when proper care is exercised the
number of accidents can be reduced.
Using the Stanford coaching staff as
an example, he stated the fact that
as a result of a careful study of the
means of preventing accidents, only
one important player, Bones Ham
ilton, was lost to competition last
year. He added that his broken jaw
should really be charged against
boxing rather than football.
He stated that brain injuries and
infections are the main causes of
deaths in football. Many of these
could be prevented by simple but
very important preliminary meas
ures of proper treatment of minor
wounds and care of equipment. Blis
tered heels due to short shoes have
caused several unnecessary deaths,
which are usually attributed to vio
lence by ignorant readers.
Deliberate dirtiness is rare in foot
ball, but a great many injuries are
caused by the psychological effect of
the coach "firing up" his boys on his
own '.age. So it is really up to the
coach to see that every precaution is
taken. Dr. Lee stated that the vic
tory-hungry alumni make the lot
of the poor old coach sufficiently
hard, but that the greatest respon
sibility rests with him.
This year will see at least fifty
and probably nearer seventy thou
sand college athletes playing foot
ball. Football is probably here to
stay, and there is no reason why
measures which are effective in re
ducing the incidence of accidents
should not be applied. Dr. Lee ended
by saying that many more students
die and are injured in automobile
accidents going to and from the
games than on the field.

games than on the field.

ft looks hazardous. But Dr. Rus
sel V. Lee, associate clinical instruc
tor of therapeutics in the School of
Medicine, tells you that it is really
not so bad as it looks. In his talk
on "The Causes of Football Inju
ries" during the Stanford University
hour, which is broadcast over KPO
at 7:45 every Monday evening, Dr.
Lee emphasized the point that the
nature of football itself makes a
certain number of injuries inevi
table, but that many more are hurt
than should be.
Dr. Lee listed several major causes
of football injuries. He believes that
when proper care is exercised the
number of accidents can be reduced.
Using the Stanford coaching staff as
an example, he stated the fact that
as a result of a careful study of the
means of preventing accidents, only
one important player, Bones Ham
ilton, was lost to competition last
year. He added that his broken jaw
should really be charged against
boxing rather than football.
He stated that brain injuries and
infections are the main causes of
deaths in football. Many of these
could be prevented by simple but
very important preliminary meas
ures of proper treatment of minor
wounds and care of equipment. Blis
tered heels due to short shoes have
caused several unnecessary deaths,
which are usually attributed to vio
lence by ignorant readers.
Deliberate dirtiness is rare in foot
ball, but a great many injuries are
caused by the psychological effect of
the coach "firing up" his boys on his
own '.age. So it is really up to the
coach to see that every precaution is
taken. Dr. Lee stated that the vic
tory-hungry alumni make the lot
of the poor old coach sufficiently
hard, but that the greatest respon
sibility rests with him.
