Another typical scene changes
with the completion, of the ultra
modern Lagunita court kitchen. An
noying crashing and rattling from
dish-washing machines and the dif
ficulty of black coming off trays are
things of the past. Sound absorbing
plaster greatly reduces the din in
the di.sh-washing room and a new
"Alumilite" process still under trial
is expected'to remove the difficulty
of tray black.
No one will spend the day at La
gunita peeling potatoes, yet the
women will have their potatoes and
they will be peeled. The answer is
an electric machine which scrapes
l;he skin off. The latest type arrange
ment for steam cooking and large
refrigerators with forced air system
for quicker cooling are among the
prize possessions of the new kitchen.

The dining hall is even more un
usual, being furnished with espe
cially designed tables and chairs. The
chairs are adapted from a Duncan-
Phyfe model and have been made
for this dining hall alone.
