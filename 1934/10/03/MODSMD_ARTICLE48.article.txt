"Bye lo baby bunting, papa's gone
j a hunting," crooned Venerable
â–  Cuckoo Gordy Steedman, tears
| streaming down his happy face. For
Happy Sappy Chappie Steedman had
just put the next issue of Chaparral
I (first college comic in the West and
practically everywhere) to bed.
I With lights turned low. Ye Olde
Stovepipe patted the little dear
j (which will go on Quad sale a week
I from tomorrow) and heaved a heavy
i sigh.
Ye Olde Stovepipe has started
hunting, hunting for blondes, bru
j nettes, and redheads to be: 1. sales
! girls for the "Back to the Farm"
number of Chappie; 2. office girls and
boys; 3. Happy Chappie boys end
| girls to turn out reams of very, very
j funny stuff for future issues.
For Happy Chappie Steedman is
going to need some more material
to keep up with the terrific pace he
set in the "Back to the Farm" news
orgy. Steedman has formally an
nounced the blowing of three or four
fuses in getting the cover for the
issue which comes out next week.
This epic depicts a traveling salcs
; man going "Back to the Farm."
In Steedman's search for beauty,
he desires all those listed above and i
others not listed to turn out for a j
meeting of the entire staff Monday i
night. Future issues wiil be dis- ,
cussed. The meeting will be held in ;
1 the Chaparral office.
