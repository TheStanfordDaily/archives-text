# Beer Selling In Paly Now
## No Protests Voiced in First Weeks of Sale 
### 
The high, thick wall of laws and
i ordinances around Stanford and vi-
I cinity, which for the last 40 years
1 has kept the sale of intoxicating bev
j crages safely without, has at last
| sprung a leak.
1 It is now possible, and has been for
I some time, to buy beer in various
I parts of Palo Alto, although the
| trickle, which burst suddenly
i through the wall about two months
j ago, has not yet reached the Stan-
I ford campus proper.
In no less than six restaurants and
eating places in Paly the shocking
signs "Beer on Draft" greeted re-
I turning Stanfordites this week. Old
j timers looked dubious. What had
| become of the strict old provisions
written on the deeds of every piece
I of Palo Alto property ?
The answer seems to be that noth
ing has happened to it as the ques
tion as, to whether selling the 3.2
beer is an infringement or not hangs
in mid air. No one as yet has said
anything. The beer dispensers are
within the law. And the administra
tors of the famous no-licker-on-
Stanford-Paly-property have done
no more than raise eyebrows.
| When last year 3.2 beer was de
| clared non-alcoholic by the Roose
j velt government it was legal to sell
!it in Palo Alto even though it is
| within the mile and a half from a
ischool limit. But Paly merchants
| were over a year in taking advan-
I tage of this fact. About nine weeks
I ago a few merchants gingerly be
! gan dispensing the notoriously im
| potent brew. Others followed. Now
beer signs are displayed boldly and
beer is sold, but only with meals,
City Attorney Arnold Rumwell
says. Whether a doughnut or ham
and eggs constitutes a meal has noi
been considered.
Meanwhile, the University's atten
tion on alcoholic matters is still
centered on the University Phar
| macy case which awaits a Supreme
■ Court decision on whether the mile
| and a half, at whose end hard liquor
i may bo sold, shall be measured from
the Quad or from the Stanford prop
erty boundaries.
The state legislature says it should
j be measured from the Quad. Farm
j officials say from the far-reaching
I campus boundaries. Mayfield resi
' dents say what the legislature says.
And the supreme court has not yet
said.
At least a moral victory for ob
jectors to advocates of the rigid dry
is a clipping salvaged from the
j Palo Alto Times c.f 25 years ago. It
j is from the story telling of the mile
j and a half limit law which was
j passed March 27, 11)09. The clipping,
! filed in the Administration building,
reads:
"Members of the faculty who ad
vocated the bill had in mind only
that portion of the campus including
I the Stanford buildings and resi
dences, the arboretum and Lagunita
! —in short, the land excluded from
j tillages."

I the Stanford buildings and resi
dences, the arboretum and Lagunita
! —in short, the land excluded from

j crages safely without, has at last
| sprung a leak.
1 It is now possible, and has been for
I some time, to buy beer in various
I parts of Palo Alto, although the

i through the wall about two months
j ago, has not yet reached the Stan-
I ford campus proper.
In no less than six restaurants and
eating places in Paly the shocking
signs "Beer on Draft" greeted re-
I turning Stanfordites this week. Old
j timers looked dubious. What had

written on the deeds of every piece
I of Palo Alto property ?
The answer seems to be that noth
ing has happened to it as the ques

beer is an infringement or not hangs
in mid air. No one as yet has said
anything. The beer dispensers are
within the law. And the administra
tors of the famous no-licker-on-
Stanford-Paly-property have done
no more than raise eyebrows.
