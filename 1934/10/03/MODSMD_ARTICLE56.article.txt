# HAROLD H. FISHER WILL DISCUSS RED TACTICS ON RADIO
## History Lecturer Speaks Over KPO Monday 
### 
What are the Commuuists aiming
at and what is the real significance
of the tactics they employ through
out the world to gain their immediate
and ultimate objectives? These ques
tions will be discussed from Station
KPO Monday evening, October 8, at
7:45 o'clock by Lecturer Harold
Henry Fisher of the Department of
History.
Fisher is the author of "The Bol
shevik Revolution," a documented
history which is to come from the
press this month, and has explored
archives in Russia and other coun
tries relating to Causes and conduct
of the World War.
In his radio talk, Fisher will dis
tinguish between the various Uto
pian types of Communism and that
which has developed out of the Bol
shevik Revolution and the existence
of a stable Communist state. In dis
cussing the tactics of Communists
throughout the world, he will ex
plain the failure of Communist prop
aganda to make headway in the
United States.
