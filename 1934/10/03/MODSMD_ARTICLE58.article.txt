# DEBATING SQUADS NEED TRYOUTEES FOR COMING YEAR
## Radio Tilts with Eastern Teams Planned 
### 
One of the toughest debating sea
sons in Stanford's history looms on
the 1934-35 horizon, according to
Lee Chapin, varsity debate coach.
Material for both varsity and
freshman teams is urgently needed,
and all students interested should
immediately get in touch with Coach
Chapin in his office in Room 200C.
On the Air
Two or three radio debates are
planned, one of which will probably
be with an Eastern institution.
One of the highlights of the de
bate year is the annual verbal dual
with San Quentin, which is always
hotly contested, and which provides
the Stanford debaters with an au
dience of usually 750 convicts. Last
year Stanford lost this debate classic
when San Quentin put up a couple
of smooth tongued ex-supei'salesmen
for their representatives. Chapin
hopes to win it this year.

Doubtless some debate tours will
be arranged, and one to the southern
part of the state is assured. Bob
Gros, debate manager, is working on
ihese.
Chapin hopes for a good turn-out
of women debaters with the in
creased enrollment of Stanford co
eds. At least a dozen eloquent women
will.be able to exercise their talents
extensively, according to the sched
ule.
