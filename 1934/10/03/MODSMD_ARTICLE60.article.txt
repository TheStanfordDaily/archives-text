# 'OLD MAC,' CAMPUS MAIL MAN, VIEWED ON QUAD NO MORE
## 
### Frank Hinman 
Alan McCaskeli, affectionately
known to Stanford as old Mac, the
shuffling mail-boy, is no longer seen
delivering mail from the post office
to Administration ouilding. A vic
tim of old age, he died at the be
ginning of August at the age of 85.
Although he was nobody's servant,
he has faithfully carried the post
at Stanford for 16 years.
He is survived by a sister, Jean,
who lives in San Francisco.
Mac's headquarters were in the
basement of the art gallery where
he had his room free and cooked
his own meals.
The aged Scot came to Stanford
after many years of travel. Born
in Glasgow, he traveled the world.
The Hawaiian Islands and Mexico
were as familiar to him as his own
Scotland. He has been in California
since the days of '49.
The Chapel was taken by Mac as
his special property on Sundays,
when he would act as sexton, hand
ing out programs and opening the
door. He was afraid that it needed
guarding with so many tourists
around. But for this extra service
on Sundays he demanded and got
a day of! on Tuesday.
Mac was very popular with the
secretraies of the Administration
building. A ladies man, each day
would find him bringing some small
thing to one of the secretaries; a
pretty rock, or a souvenir from the
fire of '06, or just a tale or opinion
taken from his wide experience.
He worked for Sir Thomas Lip
ton in the days before Lipton be
came an international character.
