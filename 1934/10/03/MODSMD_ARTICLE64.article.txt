# Hill Rogers Tours World With Father
## Russia Impresses Traveling Ex Committeeman 
### 
[ The log of Will Rogers' globe-en
cireling tour this summer which ap
peared daily in newspapers through
out the country is one and the same
with that of Bill Rogers, Stanford
polo playing, debating junior, for
Bill, his mother and brother Jim
were along on the whirlwind trip
around the world.
Bill Rogers returned to the cam
pus yesterday after making a hur
ried trip across the continent from
New York to be on hand for regis
tration day.
Russia Interesting
If it hadn't been for Russia he
wouldn't, have gone, Rogers says,
for that is the one country in the
whole of Eurasia in which he is
vitally interested. The globetrotters
spent 1(> days in the land of the
Communists which provided an op
portunity to imbibe the Russian at
mosphere and ways of living.
"The Russians are an ungodly hap
py people," Rogers said, "and they
may well have cause to be for their
standards of living are visibly being
raised."
As is usual, Rogers' description of
Russia is different from other indi
viduals' reports. Rogers was struck
not so much by the unusual condi
tions wrought by the rigid restric
tions, working and living conditions
of the people, as by the facilities pro
vided for the people during leisure
time. Particularly striking were the
many new legitimate theaters in the
cities and the mass instruction in
dancing.
Dancing Popular
"They're going In for dancing in
n big way," Rogers stated, "and they
especially like the fox trot. The
hotel dances start at midnight and
last until five a.m."
Most of the trip made by the
Rogers family was by plane. They
left Los Angeles July 28, went from
Honolulu to Tokio and from there
across Siberia to Russia. Germany
was next and then England. Will
Rogers made the plane trip through
Scandinavia alone.
"It's hard to tell much about
either Russia or Germany," Rogers
explained, "because things change so
fast. Every week sees something new
and one can never tell what will be
permanent."
In Nazi-land the striking thing to
most tourists, according to Rogers,
ere the innumerable troops of sol
diers, guards, and police in vari
colored uniforms and shirts which
pre constantly parading and drilling.
And in England the thing unusual
to foreigners is the freedom with
which radicals are allowed to speak
and demonstrate in public places.
Rogers, who lives in Encina, has
already started in polo activities and
may take an active part in journal
ism this year.

vided for the people during leisure
time. Particularly striking were the
many new legitimate theaters in the
cities and the mass instruction in
dancing.
Dancing Popular
"They're going In for dancing in
n big way," Rogers stated, "and they
especially like the fox trot. The
hotel dances start at midnight and
last until five a.m."
Most of the trip made by the
Rogers family was by plane. They
left Los Angeles July 28, went from
Honolulu to Tokio and from there
across Siberia to Russia. Germany
was next and then England. Will
Rogers made the plane trip through
Scandinavia alone.
"It's hard to tell much about
either Russia or Germany," Rogers
explained, "because things change so
fast. Every week sees something new
and one can never tell what will be
permanent."
In Nazi-land the striking thing to
most tourists, according to Rogers,
ere the innumerable troops of sol
diers, guards, and police in vari
colored uniforms and shirts which
pre constantly parading and drilling.
And in England the thing unusual
to foreigners is the freedom with
which radicals are allowed to speak
and demonstrate in public places.
Rogers, who lives in Encina, has
already started in polo activities and
may take an active part in journal
ism this year.
[ The log of Will Rogers' globe-en
cireling tour this summer which ap
peared daily in newspapers through
out the country is one and the same
with that of Bill Rogers, Stanford
polo playing, debating junior, for
Bill, his mother and brother Jim
were along on the whirlwind trip
around the world.
Bill Rogers returned to the cam
pus yesterday after making a hur
ried trip across the continent from
New York to be on hand for regis
tration day.
Russia Interesting
If it hadn't been for Russia he
wouldn't, have gone, Rogers says,
for that is the one country in the
whole of Eurasia in which he is
vitally interested. The globetrotters
spent 1(> days in the land of the
Communists which provided an op
portunity to imbibe the Russian at
mosphere and ways of living.
"The Russians are an ungodly hap
py people," Rogers said, "and they
may well have cause to be for their
standards of living are visibly being
raised."
As is usual, Rogers' description of
Russia is different from other indi
viduals' reports. Rogers was struck
not so much by the unusual condi
tions wrought by the rigid restric
tions, working and living conditions
of the people, as by the facilities pro
vided for the people during leisure
time. Particularly striking were the
many new legitimate theaters in the
cities and the mass instruction in
