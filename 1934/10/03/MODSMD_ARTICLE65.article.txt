# Dance Chairman Solicits Roble Jolly-Up Criticisms
## 
### 
There'll be some changes made—
in Ihe traditional Stanford jolly-ups,'
il the plans of Mary Livingstone,
Roble dance chairman, come to frui
tion. The growing feminine popula
tion calls for some drastic revisions
in the methods of acquainting the
rough and co-ed with one another,
.she thinks.
Accordingly, Miss Livingstone has
issued an urgent request for sug
gestions and criticisms. She wants to
know what was good about the old
jolly-ups, and what was bad. She
wants suggestions for improving
them. In short, she wants sugges
tions. Send them either to her or
to the Daily.
Future jolly-ups, says Miss Liv
ingstone, will be held in the Women's
Gymnasium. This, it is hoped, will
provide ample room for whatever
one does at jolly-ups.
The new .shilling night rate be
tween Scotland and England caused
an avalanche of calls between exiled
Scotch and their homes.
The American eagle was used as a
figure on George Washington's fa
vorite lamp in the White House.
