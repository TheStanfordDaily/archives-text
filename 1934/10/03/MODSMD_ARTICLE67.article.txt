# FIRST THREE-DAY RUSHING PERIOD STARTS NOV. 6 WHEN FROSH VISIT FRATERNITIES
## 
### 
Tuesday, November 6, besides be
ing election day, will be the first time
that the members of tlie class of '38
will have an opportunity to visit the
Row and its 900 fraternity men.
A three-day period, during which
the freshmen will attend lunches and
dinners at the various fraternities,
will start on this day, and will be
the first of three periods during this
quarter.
The full piogram of rushing, de
cided at the end of last quarter by
the Interfraternity Board of Con
trol, was made public for the first
time yesterday, and included, in ad
dition to the rushing periods men- I
tioned, three during winter quarter ;
before the final pledging day.
But until after that pledging day,,
reminded Interfraternity President 1
George Cobb, all rushing rules will i
apply, and any violators of them
will be subject to penalties inflicted
by the Interfraternity Council.
Under these rules, "all new lower J
division men prior to regular pledg
ing day must keep out of fraternity :
houses except on regularly permit
ted rushing dates," and only "normal

contact or a public and informal na
ture" is permitted between frater
nity men and new lower division
men.
One of the rules which causes mis
understandings is the one prohibit
ing fraternity men from entering
Encina. If for any reason they
should want to enter the Hall for
any business purpose, they must re
ceive permission of a sponsor and be
accompanied by a sponsor while in
the hall. This applies to all parts of
Encina.
Another much-disputed rule is
that which prohibits all off-campus
rushing, "except in the period be
tween quarters and in the summer
and Thanksgiving vacations."
Any upper division man may be
pledged during this quarter, but in
order to make the pledging official,
his name must be sent in to Robert
Cranmer, secretary of the Interfra
ternity Board.
The Inlerfraternity Council, com
posed of representatives from all the
houses, will meet within the next
two weeks to discuss all matters
relative to rushing or interfraternity
control.
