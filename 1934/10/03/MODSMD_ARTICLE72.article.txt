# Rest Homes Open Again
## Customary Hospital Service To Be Continued 
### 
Regular availability of the hospi
tal fund, the University rest home,
and hospital facilities was assured
in a recent announcement by Dr.
Thomas A. Storey, general director
of the School of Hygiene and Physi
cal Education.
"The customary hospital service
to students will naturally be con
tinued," Dr. Storey said. He added
that the Stanford Mothers' Club,
headed by Mrs. Edwin Thomas of
Palo Alto, might be consulted for the
location of their Men's Rest Home
this quarter. He doubted whether
this customary health service had
been provided for as yet, but was
certain it soon would be.
Fund Established
According to the Information Bul
letin, where all details can be ob
tained, the $5.00 each student pays,
as part of a $14 community fee, con
tributes to a hospital fund which
an indisposed student may draw on
Lo defray part of the expense at
either the Palo Alto Hospital, the
Stanford Hospital in San Francisco,
or the rest homes maintained by the
Stanford Mothers' Club.
Mrs. Owens at 553 Salvatierra is
to continue her maintenance of the
Women's Rest Home; while the
Men's Rest Home, formerly super
vised by Mrs. Carr, will be placed
elsewhere.
Contribute Funds
Summary of available informa
tion reveals that the Hospital Fund
will contribute $4.00 a day for the
first five days in a rest home.
Admission to the Women's Rest
Home must be approved by the
medical adviser of women; while
tjie medical adviser of men must
sanction a student's entrance to the
Men's Rest Home, says the Informa
tion Bulletin. Either medical adviser
may be consulted for admission to
the Palo Alio or Stanford hospitals.
The actual accomplishment of get
ting the ill student necessary treat
ment may be completed by phoning
either of the health services, which
will aid arrangement of transporta
tion.
