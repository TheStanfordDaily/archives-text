# SAVELLE RELATES OBSERVATIONS OK TOUR TO CANADA
## 
### Cedric Larson 
Dr. Max Savelle, professor of ;
Canadian history at Stanford, has :
returned to the University after a i
summer's absence wherein he spent |
many weeks in Canada.
Dr. Savelle did some research in j
Washington, D.C., and Ann Arbor, |
Michigan, in libraries containing ma
terials relative to his book on the '
Treaty of Paris of 1763. His research !
then took him into Canada.
The professor's Canadian itinerary j
included Quebec, Montreal, Ottawa, i
Winnipeg, Calgary, Banff, and Van- j
couver. Dr. Savelle found Can- )
ada less affected by the depression ,
as a whole than our own country.
He found that a great admiration
existed in Canada for the heroic j
measures taken by the present j
United States administration to i
combat the depression.
Canada Favors N.R.A.
"There is a growing manifestion of ]
feeling in Canada," the professor re- j
ports, "for the adoption by the do- j
minion government of many features
of the American NRA policy, to
find a better adjustment between
capital and labor,"
Canada is not anxious to expand j
its population further at this time
through immigration, which is rig- j
orously watched. The blighting effect
of the great midwest drought have :
only been lightly felt in Canada, Dr. â– 
Savelle states after a tour through
the great Canadian wheat belt.
Dr. Savelle is an expert in Ca- |
nadian history and government, and
studied many of the new develop- 1
ments in the Dominion government
while he was there.
Diplomacy Traced
# In the September, 1934, issue of
the "Pacific Historical Review' ap- ;
peared a monograph by Dr. Max
Savelle entitled "Colonial Origins of
American Diplomatic Policy."
In this article Dr. Savelle found
the six-fold permanent bases of
American diplomacy to be: Monroe !
doctrine, the "open door," isolation, j
pacific settlement of disputes, free- 1
dom of the seas, and arbitration. He |
traced the rise of these policies from !
1455 to 1776.
Dr. Savelle's article represents a
great deal of research in a problem j
of diplomatic history that has been J
relatively unexplored in the past.
