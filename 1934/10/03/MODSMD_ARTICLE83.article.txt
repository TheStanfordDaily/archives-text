Anyone with vocal or choral ex
perience will be welcome in the new j
University Chorus now being or- ;
ganized. says Warren D. Allen, di- .
rector. The chorus will sing in con- ;
junction with the A Capella choir j
and will also appear independently in j
special programs.
Applications will be received at |
room 84 today and tomorrow, but j
newcomers may attend the first re
hearsal to be held tomorrow night i
in the organ gallery of the Memorial j
Church.
From the membership of the cho- <
rus an A Capella choir will be chosen I
to sing at the regular Sunday chapel I
services. Former choir members are
automatically admitted, he said, but
several new voices will be added
from the chorus.
Former choir members may get
two units of University credit by
participating in both organizations;
otherwise one unit is given for either
one.
Special performances planned for
the year include Matriculation Sun
day service next Sunday, an Armi
stice Day program on November 11,
and Bach's Christmas Oratorio, to
be presented December 16. During
spring quarter the choir will appear
in a secular festival concert in con
junction with the symphony orches
tra.
