# University of Minnesota Makes R.O.T.C. Optional
## 
### 
The board of regents of the Uni
ver of Minnesota, where mililary
training has been compulsory since
the institute was founded, voted this
summer to make R.O.T.C. training
optional.
Protests over compulsory drill, in
which some 2,500 men students are
drilled each year under the regula
tion demanding two years of training
for every able-bodied undergradu
ate, have been more frequent in late
years, but the action of the board
came as a complete surprise to the
student body.
