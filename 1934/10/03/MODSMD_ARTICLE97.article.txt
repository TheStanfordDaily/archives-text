# FROSH PREPARE FOR TILT WITH MENLO ELEVEN
## Yearling Men Favorites To Win Over Jaysee In Opening Contest 
### Mort d'Evelyn 
Yesterday afternoon's scrimmage
with Grays, (he third of the season,
should leave Jimmy Bradshaw's j
frosh eleven with teamwork enough
1o permit the Babes to enter their
first game of the season with Menlo
U.C. Saturday as favorites. This de
spite the fact that Menlo won 13-6
last season and the distinct ad
vantage Menlo has of having one
game behind them in- the present
season.
That one game, last Saturday, i
showed, however, that Russ Sweet's
men are weaker than in past sea- '
son's, for Menlo dropped their opener
to Chico State Teachers College by I
a 7-0 score.
On the other hand the Stanford
frosh have a squad which is already j
being compared with the great team j
of 1932, the famous sophs of last I
year. The squad itself is almost half I
again as large as it was at this time j
last year and is fortified with more ;
than the usual number of
school greats.
Heading this list is Tommy Collins, i
who joined his fellow Portlander, I
Bobby Grayson, and came to the
Farm when football season opened j
this fall. Collins' stocky build indi- >
cates the power of a second Grayson, j
but Card fans will wait until Satur- 1
day to judge on the Portland boy's
action under fire.
Jimmy Cofiis, another half, comes j
to Stanford with an all-City stand- 1
ing, gained at Commerce High in
San Francisco. Cofiis has turned up
at practice this week with a lame ;
ankle, but should be ready to go
Saturday.
Bill Paulman comes from Oxnard
with particular ability at whipping i
out passes, and with Bob Dakan,
from Commerce High of San Fran
cisco, as a receiver the Frosh should
present a distinct threat in an aerial
way. Other boys certain tp get a try
;it the backlield posts are Ed Gillette,
Doc Luckett, and Glenn Hamilton. '
