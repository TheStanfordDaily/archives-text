# 20 Freshmen Join Yets In Polo Tryouts
## Entire '33-'34 Team Back This Year; Practice To Start Monday 
### 
Twenty freshmen, as well as many
of last year's veterans, who reported
to Lieutenant H. Y. Grubbs on Mon
day form a goodf basis for the pre
diction that the varsity polo team
will rise to even greater success
than the one that preceded it.
To be that successful they must
win 100 per cent of their games.
Captain Richard Gordan, whose
place Lieutenant Grubbs has taken,
coached last year's riders to victory
in 20 of the 22 games they played.
1933-34 Team Back
All of last year's first team are 1
back to play again this year, and!
many of the other veterans of A
Squad. Among those already back
getting limbered up in the saddle
are Russ Rasmussen, Luppe Luppen.
Bill Rogers, Bob Fullerton, Bill I
Enemark, Cal Emeis, Frankie Burns,
Ed McKeon, and Rach Harris, all of
whom were seen in action frequently
last year.
More than 50 are expected to turn
out for the first practice of the year
next Monday. Lieutenant Grubbs
plans to divide them into the custo
mary A, B, and C Squads, and spend
the first three or four weeks riding
before doing any actual mallet
wielding.
New Horses Arrive
Sixteen new horses have arrived
at R.O.T.C. stables since last June, !
and all of them, according to Lieut.
Grubbs, should turn into good polo
mounts. Most of the preliminary
riding will be devoted to breaking ;
in these horses.
The season will open during the
Christmas holidays and, although no
definite schedule has been arranged,
the probable opponent in the first
game will be Arizona, the toughest
four the Indians rode against last
year. The season will continue until
late in May, stretching it to the
longest of any sport season on the
campus.
