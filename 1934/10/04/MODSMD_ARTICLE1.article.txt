# WILBUR ISSUES WELCOME FOR NEW STUDENTS
## Offers Counsel for Wise University Career At General Meeting PRESIDENT HUMOROUS Hall Packed for Addresses Of President, Deans 
### 
Speaking deliberately, earnestly
and with touches of gentle irony that
provoked to laughter the gaily
dressed Stanford men and women
who jammed into the Assembly Hall,
Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur welcomed
new and old Stanford students to
the friendship of the farm at the
all-University Assembly yesterday
morning. With Dean of Men George
Culver and Dean of Women Mary
Yost, Dr. Wilbur had come to coun
sel Stanford students to conduct
themselves wisely while at Stanford.
Inscrutable of countenance, stand
ing tall and alone, the President
looked out at the blue, yellow, and
pink dotted with a few plati
numod heads of the new women,
; nd the darker colorings of the male,
that made up the audience.
In their brilliant plumage, most
of the students gazed back silently
at their President with countenances
as unchanging as his, except for the
times when they relaxed to laugh
at his humor.
'■Exposure*' to Library
Admitting the repetition of his
favorite theme, Dr. Wilbur asked
the students to realize that gasoline
and alcohol do not mix, to observe
the "No Smoking" tradition on the
Quad as a matter of fire prevention,
and to . eek the truth and shun the
hokum in our present day life.
Saying a certain "exposure to the
library" was desirable, the President
recommended students to get as
much as possible out of the educa
tional opportunities offered them at
Stanford so they could survive the
intense competition of modern life.

About fast driving, Dr. Wilbur
spoke earnestly and lengthily and
urged the students to allow the oak
trees on Palm Drive a chance to
grow up. And then he l'evealed that
live-oak trees have been planted
between the palms so that in the
future Palm Drive will no longer be
lined with palms. "But we'd like to
take them out ourselves," he said.
Preceding the President's address
were the speeches of the two deans:
Mary Yost and George B. Culver,
both of them greeting the students
in their talks.

"Dean Mary" said that there are
two sources of education at Stanford:
work done in the classroom, and
the contacts and relations gained
through the living units and activi
ties. Although remarking that she
thought some of the by-laws would
need changing, the Dean of Women
complimented the adoption of the
new Constitution now governing
A.S.S.U. She said, "It's aim was
democratic and efficient govern
ment."
Dean Culver in good-natured
manner told of troubles he had ex
perienced in being taken for every
body except Dean Culver, and more
seriously asked students to seek the
all-around personality characteristic
of Stanford men.

were the speeches of the two deans:
Mary Yost and George B. Culver,
both of them greeting the students
in their talks.
Suggests Changes
"Dean Mary" said that there are
two sources of education at Stanford:
work done in the classroom, and
the contacts and relations gained
through the living units and activi
ties. Although remarking that she
thought some of the by-laws would
need changing, the Dean of Women
complimented the adoption of the
new Constitution now governing
A.S.S.U. She said, "It's aim was
democratic and efficient govern
ment."
Dean Culver in good-natured
manner told of troubles he had ex
perienced in being taken for every
body except Dean Culver, and more
seriously asked students to seek the
all-around personality characteristic
of Stanford men.
Speaking deliberately, earnestly
and with touches of gentle irony that
provoked to laughter the gaily
dressed Stanford men and women
who jammed into the Assembly Hall,
Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur welcomed
new and old Stanford students to
the friendship of the farm at the
all-University Assembly yesterday
morning. With Dean of Men George
Culver and Dean of Women Mary
Yost, Dr. Wilbur had come to coun
sel Stanford students to conduct
themselves wisely while at Stanford.
Inscrutable of countenance, stand
ing tall and alone, the President
looked out at the blue, yellow, and
pink dotted with a few plati
numod heads of the new women,
; nd the darker colorings of the male,
that made up the audience.
In their brilliant plumage, most
of the students gazed back silently
at their President with countenances
as unchanging as his, except for the
times when they relaxed to laugh
at his humor.
'■Exposure*' to Library
Admitting the repetition of his
favorite theme, Dr. Wilbur asked
the students to realize that gasoline
and alcohol do not mix, to observe
the "No Smoking" tradition on the
Quad as a matter of fire prevention,
and to . eek the truth and shun the
hokum in our present day life.
Saying a certain "exposure to the
library" was desirable, the President
recommended students to get as
much as possible out of the educa
tional opportunities offered them at
Stanford so they could survive the
intense competition of modern life.

About fast driving, Dr. Wilbur
spoke earnestly and lengthily and
urged the students to allow the oak
trees on Palm Drive a chance to
grow up. And then he l'evealed that
live-oak trees have been planted
between the palms so that in the
future Palm Drive will no longer be
lined with palms. "But we'd like to
take them out ourselves," he said.
