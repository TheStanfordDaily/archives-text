## 
### 
Featured by yells, eats, and talks
by prominent men on the campus,
the first Encina smoker of the year
was held in the hall lobby last night.
The huge numbers of the class of
'38 helped to produce lots of noise
and enthusiasm.
Head Yell Leader Jimmy Triolo
started the program with his assist
ants, Dick Stark and Ed Butter
worth, by leading the frosh in Stan
ford yells. Ernie NeVers followed by
urging the first-year men to go out
for athletics, and Lieutenant-Colonel
Donald C. Cubbison spoke in behalf
of the R.O.T.C.
Johnny Lyman, head sponsor, ac
quainted the frosh with life on the
campus in a .short talk, and also ad
vised them of the importance of
making the right contacts. Marvie
Kahn, president of the A.S.S.U.,
boosted extra-curricular activities,
and Almon E. Roth, comptroller of
the University, warned Encina men
against rowdy conduct in the dining
halls.
The evening ended with several
piano solos by Wally Baird and the
distribution of cigarettes and apple
cider.
