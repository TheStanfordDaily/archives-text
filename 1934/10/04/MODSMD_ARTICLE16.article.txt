# Frosh-Soph Fray Dated
## 
### 
First official hand-to-hand con
flict between frosh and sophs seemed
set last night when Marvin Kahn,
president of the A.S.S.U., announced
that the traditional mud fight is
planned for next Thursday at 3
o'clock on the freshman football
field, pending the expected approval
of the Ex Committee.
Tuesday night the final word will
come from the Ex Committee, but
meanwhile recruits will be gathered
on both sides and captains elected in
preparation for the fracas.
Kahn announced the appointment
of three Encina sponsors, John Mot
tram, Bob Church, and Sam Brad
shaw, to supervise Ihe battle, and
added that all sponsors would be
on hand as supervisors and judges.
Having beaten '36 in the last battle,
'37 will be out to be the first, class in
some time to win the fight in both
its freshman and sophomore years.
Kahn said victory would be deter
mined by the most men thrown in
the mud pits by opponents. The
rule of not permitting men once
thrown in to return to the fight will
be enforced, he added.
