Coyly licking fingers to stop runs
in silk stockings, studiously comb
| ing curly locks tinted all shades the
| drug store furnishes, screaming at
room-mates across tho Quad the de
tails of last night's date or a billet
doux from the man they left behind
them, Stanford's acme of femininity
descends upon the Quad for its first
fling at what father has told them to .
be the main part of their college
career: classes.
Hollywood has done its best for
this year's crop of what is wistfully
called "New Women." Copies of
equine Hepburn, gloomy Garbo, and
la Crawford, while not as identical ,
look just as bad as the originals do
off the screen.
Clothes about which salesgirls all
over the United States have said:

"That looks ju.st too, too divine on
you, dearie, don't it, madom?":
sweaters that whisper, plaids that
shout; hats that climb, swoop, and
swirl and then end up with a feather
somewhere involved with shell-pink
ear; suit coats that are direct steals
of the men's bi-swing sportsâ€”back
and with the same rough fabrics
with hay and odd bits of baling wire
woven in.
Dressing for classes with the hope
that some Hellenic God will sit next
to them or notice them from some
place across the room, primping in
front of mirrors, the kaleidoscope of
blues, purples, wild greens, crazy
yellows, delicate pinks and wine
reds, will attend classes, forgetting
notebooks, pencils, and professors in
the pure thrills of co-educational
silting.
