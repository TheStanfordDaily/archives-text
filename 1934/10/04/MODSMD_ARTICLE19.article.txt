# ST. LOUIS WINS WORLD SERIES OPENER, 8 TO 3
## Detroit Infield Cracks As Dizzy Dean Allows But Eight Hits

(Associated Press Sports Editor)
DETROIT, Oct. 3 (£>).—'The front- ;
line of the Tiger defense, the iron- j
man infield that they heralded as the
"battalion of death" crumbled and ;
fell back today in wild disorder, j
spreading nothing but doom to De
troit's hopes us the rampant St. Louis
Cardinals poured through gaping I
holes to sweeping victory in the first
skirmish of the 1934 world cham
pionship baseball battle.
Five errors by this jittery Tiger j
infield in the first three innings, most I
of them the kind of mistakes that
a sand-lotter would have been j
ashamed of, enabled the National
League champions to take quick l
command of the proceedings and I
then smash the remnants of Detroit's i
resistance with a powerhouse attack !
led by Joe Medwick, slugging out
fielder, who tied a World Series v ec- !
ord with four straight hits, including i
a home run.
Wins Three in Week
The final score was 8 to 3 and the j
verdict overwhelmingly in favor of j
the clouting Cardinals as they I
coasted to victory behind the effec
tive pitching of the celebrated Je
rome Herman (Dizzy) Dean, king
of the National League's pitchers,
signalized the fact they are still rid
ing the crest of the wave that carried
them to sensational belated triumph
in the pennant race over the New
York Giants.
The mighty Dean, the tall, gawky
Oklahoman whose fireball had spread
destruction throughout the National
League and tossed fearsome rever
berations into the Americans' camp,
pitched his third full game victory
within a six-day period. With less
than three days of rest since he
blanked the Reds for the second time
in the closing drive of the Cardinals
to the top, Dean subdued the Tiger
with a resourceful if not altogether
brilliant exhibition.
Tigers Ragged
The elder of the famous pair of
pitching brothers lacked his custo
mary control and yielded eight base
| hits, including a booming home run
by Hank Greenberg in the eighth
inning, but he was seldom if any
thing resembling real danger or
called upon to bear down against the
resultory Detroit attack. Dizzy had
j his "fire ball" when he needed it,
! however, and he was content largely
to ride along behind the steadily in
creasing lead that his team-mates
| piled up.
I Against Alvin ("General") Crowd
er, Fred ("Firpo") Marbery and
Elon ("Big Chief") Hog.sett, the
Cardinals banged out 13 hits, cap
j ping the climax of the rout with a
; four-run drive in the sixth that
| chased Marberry from the box. This
j settled any lingering doubt about
ihe outcome, as Dean himself led the
i onslaught with a rousing two-bagger,
although the Tigers had already
tossed away most of their chances in
some of the most ragged exhibitions
I ever witnessed in a championship
| game.
Crowdcr Come-back Fails
Whatever chance the veteran
Crowdcr had to give Dean a real
battle and achieve his come-back
goal, after being a victim of the
Giants in last year's series and then
cast off by the Senators, was dis
sipated by the complete crack-up of
the Tiger inner quartet at the outset.
Two errors by Marvin Owen, the
third baseman, and one each by Ihe
other members of the "battalion of
death" led directly to the first three
Cardinal runs with Crowder help
less to do anything about it.
Crowdcr yielded only six hits in
the five innings he worked, includ
ing Medwick's fifth inning home run.
With a tight defense that big wal
lop might have represented the only
run off him but the "General' re
tired for a pinch hitter and his suc
cessors were promptly belted all over
the park. Marberry lasted only two
thirds of an inning and Hogsett, a
southpaw, gained control of a hope
less situation only after being pasted
for a doublet by Bill DeLancey,
Cardinal catcher, which brought in
the last two St. Louis runs.

DETROIT, Oct. 3 (£>).—'The front- ;
line of the Tiger defense, the iron- j
man infield that they heralded as the
"battalion of death" crumbled and ;
fell back today in wild disorder, j
spreading nothing but doom to De
troit's hopes us the rampant St. Louis
Cardinals poured through gaping I
holes to sweeping victory in the first
skirmish of the 1934 world cham
pionship baseball battle.
Five errors by this jittery Tiger j
infield in the first three innings, most I
of them the kind of mistakes that
a sand-lotter would have been j
ashamed of, enabled the National
League champions to take quick l
command of the proceedings and I
then smash the remnants of Detroit's i
resistance with a powerhouse attack !
led by Joe Medwick, slugging out
fielder, who tied a World Series v ec- !
ord with four straight hits, including i
a home run.
Wins Three in Week
The final score was 8 to 3 and the j
verdict overwhelmingly in favor of j
the clouting Cardinals as they I
coasted to victory behind the effec
tive pitching of the celebrated Je
rome Herman (Dizzy) Dean, king
of the National League's pitchers,
signalized the fact they are still rid
ing the crest of the wave that carried
them to sensational belated triumph
in the pennant race over the New
York Giants.
The mighty Dean, the tall, gawky
Oklahoman whose fireball had spread
destruction throughout the National
League and tossed fearsome rever
berations into the Americans' camp,
pitched his third full game victory
within a six-day period. With less
than three days of rest since he
blanked the Reds for the second time
in the closing drive of the Cardinals
to the top, Dean subdued the Tiger
with a resourceful if not altogether
brilliant exhibition.
Tigers Ragged
The elder of the famous pair of
pitching brothers lacked his custo
mary control and yielded eight base
| hits, including a booming home run
by Hank Greenberg in the eighth
inning, but he was seldom if any
thing resembling real danger or
called upon to bear down against the
resultory Detroit attack. Dizzy had
j his "fire ball" when he needed it,
! however, and he was content largely
to ride along behind the steadily in
creasing lead that his team-mates
| piled up.
I Against Alvin ("General") Crowd
er, Fred ("Firpo") Marbery and

Cardinals banged out 13 hits, cap

; four-run drive in the sixth that
| chased Marberry from the box. This
j settled any lingering doubt about
ihe outcome, as Dean himself led the
i onslaught with a rousing two-bagger,
although the Tigers had already
tossed away most of their chances in
some of the most ragged exhibitions
I ever witnessed in a championship
| game.
Crowdcr Come-back Fails
Whatever chance the veteran
Crowdcr had to give Dean a real
battle and achieve his come-back
goal, after being a victim of the
Giants in last year's series and then
