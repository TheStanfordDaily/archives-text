# Registration Totals Break All Records
## 1930 High Surpassed; 3635 Pay Tuition 
### 
Registration figures continue to
soar, shattering all previous records,
and reaching a new high of 3635
new and returning students who
have signed away three months of
their lives for the nominal sum of
$114. This is an increase over the
second day of registration when 359!)
were reported registered.
Last year at this time 3316 was the
total, and the highest number which
has ever been attained previous to
this year was the 1930 high of 3606.
After 1930, prospective Stanlcrdites
evidently felt the depression, for
registration fell off until there were
only 3287 Indians in 1933.
Although Tuesday the registra
tion totals had not equaled the 1930
figure, late comers have sent the
number up to well above the for
mer supposedly not-to-be-repeated
record.
The admission of additional wom
en has not only broken the old tra
dition of the "500," but promises to
shatter many other traditions by
decreasing the ratio of men to women
from stol to 2Va to 1. The number
of women has increased from 787 in
1933 to 1024, and registration for
men has increased from 2500 to 2575.
