# Thirty-four Players Entrain Today for Oregon State Game
## Webfeet Present Threat In Red Franklin, Speedy Open Field Ace 
### 
This afternoon at 2 o'clock 34
members of the Stanford varsity en
train for Portland, Ore., and the
game Saturday with Oregon State
College in the Multnomah Stadium.
Yesterday afternoon found the
lameness and stiffness of last Sat
urday's bruising Santa Clara game
I submerged beneath high spirits as
the first eleven romped through an
hour or so of signal practice. This
despite the absence of two men who
started the Bronco contest, Bob
Hamilton and Alf Brandin. Hamil
ton is bothered with a severe case of
fever blisters ""while Brandin is
handicapped by an infected sinus.
Both are expected to make the trip,
and Hamilton, at least, will be ready
for action Saturday.
Practice Is Intense
For the second and third strings,
! however, yesterday's practice was
far from light. The first hour was
.spent in blocking while the remain
' de r was devoted to a stiff scrimmage.
Fans noted the great drive of Gor
don Head on smashes over guard and
were pleased to see Wes Muller fully
recovered from his early season
shoulder injury and again playing a
smart defensive game. Jack Drown,
tackle, and Joe Vigna at safety also
stood out for defensive play.

Of the 34 making the trip, Coach
Tiny Thornhill will be worried by
;i considerable list of injured, in addi
tion to Hamilton and Brandin.
Among these is Ben Palamourtain,
not yet fully recovered from ail at
tack oi flu suffered just preceding
the opening of practice. Harry Carl
son in practice yesterday turned an
ankle which will hai'dly be strong
by Saturday.
The first eleven last night was
composed of Topping and Moscrip,
ends; Callaway and Reynolds,
tackles; Adams and Rouble, guards;
Lar.sen, center; Maentz and Van
Dellen, halves; Alustiza, quarter;
and Grayson, full.
The degree of the Oregon State
opposition evidently will be deter
mined by the physical condition of
Red Franklin and how long this
leader of the Webfoot attack can
remain in the game. Jimmy Pholan,
Washington coach, picked O.S.C. to
win the San Francisco University
contest last Friday "largely through
Red Franklin's running." Franklin
was forced out early in the game
and the Don's proceeded to lick Ore
yon State by a 10-0 margin. Au
thorities promise, however, that
Franklin's dislocated knee will be
ready for the Stanford contest.
The Webfeet, led by Franklin, will
not be a pushover as most fans have
long estimated Oregon teams as.
Lon Stiner's men have the habit of
taking on the "big teams" just as
they do their small neighbors, Wil
lamette and Columbia, and producing
unpredictable upsets. The mighty
Trojans, before the Card game and
with a record of 24 straight wins
behind them, journeyed up to Port
land ia.st year for their Oregon State
"bre;.ther" and went home with their
record broken by eleven iron men
who held the Coast's great to a 0-0
tic.
