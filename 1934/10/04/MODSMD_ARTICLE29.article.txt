# Dollars and Dough Nuts

### 
More than 500* couples were jammed into
the Women's (iymnasium Tuesday night and
iaid one dollar on the line lor pai licipalion
privileges in one of the greatest exhibitions
of wrestling to the tunc of music ever staged
on I he Stanford campus.
So one thousand Stanford people, a major
ity new to llie Farm, received a first impres
sion of local social leslivities and managed
to enjoy themselves in spite of the failure of
those in charge lo complete proper arrange
ments for so popular an allair.
Everybody had a fairly good time, thanks
10 the friendly, talkative crowd rather than
to any effort to please on the part of dance
promoters.
Thai there were no decorations is of little
importance it is possible to dance without
fancy surroundings. But the lack ol sulli
cient chairs for use during intermissions, no
platform for the orchestra to be raised above
the level of the dancers, and the fact that
there was no "hack-drop behind the oil lies-
Ira to provide acoustical balance conslituU
a serious black eye for campus affairs.
Instead of the much needed ten- or twelve
piece orchestra, Cap and ('.own hired a good
seven-piece aggregation that did its best but
couldn't do the impossible.
That is the fault that lies in permitting an
individual organization to promote an nII-
I'niversitv dance for private gain, even though
11 | K Â» for n group scholarship. Rather than
look to the future, the first thought is to make
as much money as possible. Perhaps the
same organization wouldn t be giving the
dance again ,and therefore has no particular
interest in catering to customers in the hope
of return patronage at a later dale. So the
niceties of a really good campus dance are
forgotten, and the dollar (any standard > rules
all.
Students are disappointed, and will prob
ably not allow any repetition of such action
in the future granting of dates. A.S.S.I . heads
report that all-l'niversily atTairs will be spon
sored directly by the Activities Council and
the dancing campus is assured ol its mone\ s
worth in fun and entertainment at the next
dance of the season.
