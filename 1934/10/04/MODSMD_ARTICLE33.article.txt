Sometime soon, Stanford men and women
might find it diverting lo idle into the newest
addition to their Union cellar, the notorious
"sun porch." The thing has been billed lo
their account, approximately .$15,00(1 for the
pile of stucco itself,and *9,500 for fillings and
furniture, part of which was placed in the
old kitchen.
The plain board motif bears a sharp re
semblance lo some second-rate beer parlors
we have encountered, minus, of course, the
leavening effect of the mugs of suds. Yes,
best get there in a hurry before the sacrile
gious l'rosh have imprinted the tables with
initials and the now Ã¼biquitous women have
burned them with cigarette stubs.
Contemplate. The new addition is fine. Hut
remember, every lime a Stanford man planks
down his tuition, one cold dollar of ii is ap
propriated by those who control this sort of
thing. The women are belter oil'; their dollar
provides maintenance merely for.a clubhouse,
and (hey are building rio "sun porches" over
that way. Perhaps some wise soul shortly will
beget plans for a "moon veranda."
