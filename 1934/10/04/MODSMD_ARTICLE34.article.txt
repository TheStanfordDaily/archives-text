The Campus Opinion column, haven of all
student gripes and pel peeves, with a few
bouquets occasionally thrown in for good
measure, is open to all comers again this year.
Anyone with a grievance to air need only
have due regard for the libel laws and, above
all, keep his remarks to a minimum of 150
words. Contributors must also sign their
names in order to fix responsibility for any
particularly reverberating outburst.
So if you have anything on your chest, gel
rid of il in the columns of the Daily. Not only
do student comments make interesting read
ing but Ihev frequently lead to even more
entertaining return salies.
Simply remember that brevity is the soul,
not only ol wit, but of campus opinions.
