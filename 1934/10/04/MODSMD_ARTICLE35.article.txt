"ONE NIGHT OF LOVE" (Columbia)
At Blanco's Theater, Mountain View

Grace Moore makes a brilliant re
turn to the screen in one of the
year's best pictures. The story has
to do with the trials besetting the
path of a rising opera star, with, of
course, amorous complications.
But, the plot is merely an excuse
for the presentation of several
scenes and arias from popular

operas. These, exquisitely done, prove that the cine
matic presentation of opera will be a fertile field of
future production. —Brill.
MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM
Al War Memorial Opera House, S.F.
"What the great will do the lesser will prattle of.'-
Max Reinhardt has produced a show and there has been
much prattle of self-appointed critics. The San Fran
cisco and Hollywood audiences had heard of Dr.
Reinhardt as the greatest genius of the modern theater
and when he lavished his talents into a glorious spec
tacle they thought they were seeing Barnum and
Bailey or DeMille. Truly they saw Rhinehardt at his
best. All of the forces of the theater were at work to
make Shakespeare's comedy an event of beauty, charm,
grace, and humor.
The intimacy of the lines has been replaced by
broad gesture suited to the heroic size of the produc
tion. The low comedy of the craftsmen is grotesquely
farced after the German manner; it is not a burlesque
of English low comedy.
In the half-lighted mist of the green slope, the
ballet catches the delicacy of a Corot come to life.
Nini Theilade, brought over from Europe by Reinhardt.
completely enthralled her audiences in both the San
Francisco and Hollywood productions. Her dancing
carried the show into the unreality of aesthetic distance
so necessary for this particular comedy. Into this
atmosphere of quiet unreality Julie Haydon and Philip
Arnhold, as Titania and Oberon, move in complete
harmony and charm. Young Mickie Rooncy as Puck,
completes this trio with rare genius. He IS Puck a
scrambling imp with a suitably raucous voice. His
performances are amazing in his grasp of the part.
Again—he IS Puck, and San Francisco will probably
never see one again as adequate.
The high spot of the comedy is attained bv Walter
Connely as Bottom. He has drawn out all of 'he
humor Shakespeare put into the lines, and with Rein
hardt has devised business which never fails lo reduce
the audience to howling laughter.
Of the rest, the charming Olivia de Haviland. Ev.'lyn
Venable, Bill Henry, George Walcott, Otk Harlan and
John Lodge are more than adequate in their perform
ances. Jacqueline deWit, formerly of Stanford, played
Hypolita in lh«> Bowl with stately grace, and is now
alternating with Franceses Bragiotti. Stanford was
represented in the Bowl presentation by Marjorie
Melezer, Jean Albertson, Florence Waddelt, Jacqueline
de Wit, Henry Brill, and Robert Balzer, and in San
Francisco by Jane Hewlett and Neat Berry.
The genius of Shakespeare, Mendelssohn, and l?« in
hardt together have given California .1 f< tival which
could not be duplicated. —R.L.D.
