# CAMPUS OPINION

The Editor, Sir:
When we were elected as student
members of the Board of Athletic
Control, we automatically assumed
(he responsibility of interpreting and
presenting the students' viewpoints
and wishes as regards the business
of the Board.
The functions of the BA.C. are the
management, of intercollegiate ath
letics, schedule making, finances,
construction and maintenance of
athletic buildings and grounds, and
the recommendation for appoint
ments to the athletic staff.
Up to the present, we have at
tempted to do this work in some
what of a blind fashion, that is, with
out the aid of the students at large.
Each member has only a limited
acquaintanceship, and therefore,
only the attitudes of a few have been
taken care of.
Now we appeal to every student to
bring his grievances and suggestions
to our attention. We pledge earnest
consideration and, whenever neces
sary, action. In this way only can
student representation mean any
thing to you.
It may be well to point out that
there is equal representation on the
Board among the faculty, alumni,
and the students. It is up to the stu
dent body to determine how effec
tive undergraduate ideas are to be
in moulding the actions of the
B.A.C. Often the alumni and fac
ulty members will delay commit
ting themselves on & question until
they have heard from the student
representatives.
And so, if we are to answer intel
ligently and in accordance with
your feelings, we must have word
from you.
Sincerely,
Stanley Anderson
Chuck White
