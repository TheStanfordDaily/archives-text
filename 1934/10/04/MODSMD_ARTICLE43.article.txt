# German Head Gives Farm Impressions
## 
### John McClelland 
To Stanford this year has come
Dr. Baynard Quincy Morgan, au
! thor, scholar, and teacher of Ger
man at the University of Wisconsin
for twenty-seven years, to direct the
destinies of the Farm's German de
partment. He replaces Dr. William
Alpha Cooper who served in the
German department for 33 years and
who retired last spring.
Motored Out
Dr. Morgan and his family mo
tored from Madison, Wisconsin, early
last month and have established their
home on Santa Maria Street in the
hills behind the University.
Already enthusiastic over his new
work, Dr. Morgan is especially well
pleased with the ease and informal
manner typical of Stanford instruc
tion and the student's relationship
with their instructors.
Interviewed last night, the new
German head made a prediction
which has probably oCurred to more
than one person interested in Stan
ford affairs.
Balance Changed
"This influx of new women," he
said, "is very likely to change the
balance of Stanford, decreasing the
emphasis on the scientific side and
increasing interest and emphasis on
the cultural side."
Dr. Morgan says he will be glad to
see this change of emphasis. He
likes to see a great university well
balanced with the cultural side not
neglected for vocational training,
feeling that in the future technical
improvements will make it possible
for work to be done in less time and
believing that people should know
how to truly enjoy their leisure.
Thus it is Dr. Morgan's belief that
Stanford cultural subjects, well
known to be second to vocational
subjects, will come into their own.
Not only is Dr. Morgan interested
in the German language, but also in |
the German people themselves. "I
view with sympathy the efforts of
the German people to raise their
selevs from the conditions wrought
by the war," he declared, "and I ]
think those of us on this side ol the
water should wait patiently and |
sympathetically until their revolu
tionary changes are complete."
Well Known
Dr. Morgan is one of the best
known figures in American Ger
man teaching circles. He obtained |
his A.B. at Trinity College in Con- I
necticut and his Ph.D. at the Uni
versity of Leipzig in Germany. Ex- !
cept for a time during the war when
he served in the military intelli
gence service, he has been at the j
University of Wisconsin.
Dr. Morgan belongs to Phi Beta
Kappa, Alpha Chi Rho, various Gor
man and professorial associations, i
and is the author of "Nature in Mid- i
die High German Lyrics," "Elemen- 1
tary German Syntax," "Bibliography ;
of German Literature in English
Translation," and is co-author of ;
"Introduction to German" and com- [
piler and editor of "The German '
Mind."
Annelies Morgan, the doctor's eld- ,
est daughter, is a senior in the Uni- i
versity and his other daughter,
Margaret, attends the Stanford
grammar school.
