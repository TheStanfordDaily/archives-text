# BIG TURNOUT FOR BOXING CAMPAIGN OPENS NEW YEAR
## 
### 
In preparation for the opening of !
the boxing season, in the form of
the annua! novice tournament ten
tatively set for December 6 or 7, !
oach Myron R. Schall has inaugu- <
rated intensive training with a good
turnout.
Although the regular varsity sea- j
son does not commence until the I
middle of winter quarter, Coach
Schall emphasized the need for get
ting into shape early in this sport
that requires the finest condition.
The novice tournament, it was ex
plained. is open to all men in the
University who have not won box- !
ing letters or events in previous com- j
petition. Suitable awards are donated
each year to winners in the re
spective weight classes.
Hesitating to venture such an early
opinion as to the chances of his var- 1
sity leather-pushers, Coach Schall |
admitted "that there were indications 1
of a pretty good team." He has sev- '
oral lettermen as a nucleus around
which to build a winning aggrega
tion. The schedule of the team is as
yet undetermined. The annual Cali
fornia tournaments, one in Winter
quarter and the other in Spring, will
be held as usual with the proba
bility of a competition against a
U.C.L.A. team, Coach Schall said.
Launching the varsity season will be
the All-University boxing cham
pionships, plans for which are as yet!
undecided, which will come early in
the Winter quarter.
Commenting on the effect of last!
year's A.S.S.U. resolution providing !
ihc granting of a block S to men â€¢
holding three Circle-S minor sport'
awards, Coach Schall remarked on j
the resultant marked increase in in
vest in boxing and other minor
. ports on the campus. The incenlive,
formerly lacking, for continued effort
and interest by men on the boxing
team is now apparent. Coach Schall

believes many will remain with box
ing now with such a goal to strive
for who might otherwise be attracted
to other sports.
A call for sophomore managers has
been issued by Senior Boxing Man
ager Hank Noel. All 1937 men in
terested are urged to see Neel r.ny
Monday, Wednesday, or Friday af
ternoon at 5 o'clock in the boxing
room of Encina gym.
