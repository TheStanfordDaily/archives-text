but one civil case. The latter was so
badly bungled it would better not:

Threats of three serious strikes
j on the Pacific coast faced the fed
! eration today as it girded for prob
ably its most important battle,
whether the A. F. of L. should or- t
ganize the labor of the United States
along industrial cr craft lines.
