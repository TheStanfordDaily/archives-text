# FROSH PREPARE FOR OAK GAME
## 
### 
With Saturday's line-up not yet
a certainty, Frosh Coach Jim Brad
shaw sent his hopefuls through a
crimmage with the Grays again yes
terday, getting ready to open the
season against Menlo J.C.
Jim CofTis and Grant Stone are
doubtful starters, owing to injuries,
offis, who ran to All-City honors at
Commerce High as a big halfback
threat, is still bothered by his lame
leg, and Bradshaw has not as yet
worked him in scrimmage. Stone's
nose, smashed Tuesday, will keep
him from starting at end.
Bradshaw yesterdya gave his prob
able starting line-up: Bob Dakan
and Berneth Layer, ends; Irving
Heningson and Cy Oberg, tackles;
John Partridge and Jay Holridge,
guards; and Nelly Heath, center. In
(he backfield will be "Tex" Luckett,
Bill Paulman, Ed Gillette, and either
Leo Madlem or Tom Collins.
Collins is '38's Grayson, even to
the walk. Sideline fans are watch
ing him closely, knowing him to be
a mighty sweet ball packer. Layer,
running with the first string at end
yesterday, showed some neat pass
catching, which he learned at Sa
linas High playing both football and
basketball.
The scrimmage against the Grays,
a team composed largely of the '37
frosh, failed to show anything of
immediate interest. On the first play
Johnny Campbell tossed a long pass
to Walt Chouteau, good for 50 yards,
and in five more plays had com
pleted three. Thereupon Bradshaw
set his frosh secondary for a pass
defense, and the babes grounded the
rest of Campbell's bullets. Dakan
played commendable defensive ball
at left end.
Menlo's defeat at the hands of
Chico State Saturday is not signifi
cant, as the strength of the latter
team is not known. It is well known,
however, that the Oaks beat the
frosh last year and have always
boasted a well-balanced team. Coach
Russ Sweet uses the Warner system.
Wally Goodnow is the reputed
Menlo flash, and will probably carry
most of the opposing attack. His
running mate, Kestley, was injured
in the Chico game and will not play
Saturday. The >latter is no small
loss, as Kestley, playing for Palo
Alto High, won all-Peninsula honors.

ing him closely, knowing him to be
a mighty sweet ball packer. Layer,
running with the first string at end
yesterday, showed some neat pass
catching, which he learned at Sa
linas High playing both football and
basketball.
The scrimmage against the Grays,
a team composed largely of the '37
frosh, failed to show anything of
immediate interest. On the first play
Johnny Campbell tossed a long pass
to Walt Chouteau, good for 50 yards,
and in five more plays had com
pleted three. Thereupon Bradshaw
set his frosh secondary for a pass
defense, and the babes grounded the
rest of Campbell's bullets. Dakan
played commendable defensive ball
at left end.
Menlo's defeat at the hands of
Chico State Saturday is not signifi
cant, as the strength of the latter
team is not known. It is well known,
however, that the Oaks beat the
frosh last year and have always
boasted a well-balanced team. Coach
Russ Sweet uses the Warner system.
Wally Goodnow is the reputed
Menlo flash, and will probably carry
most of the opposing attack. His
running mate, Kestley, was injured
in the Chico game and will not play
Saturday. The >latter is no small
loss, as Kestley, playing for Palo
Alto High, won all-Peninsula honors.
With Saturday's line-up not yet
a certainty, Frosh Coach Jim Brad
shaw sent his hopefuls through a
crimmage with the Grays again yes
terday, getting ready to open the
season against Menlo J.C.
Jim CofTis and Grant Stone are
doubtful starters, owing to injuries,
offis, who ran to All-City honors at
Commerce High as a big halfback
threat, is still bothered by his lame
leg, and Bradshaw has not as yet
worked him in scrimmage. Stone's
nose, smashed Tuesday, will keep
him from starting at end.
Bradshaw yesterdya gave his prob
able starting line-up: Bob Dakan
and Berneth Layer, ends; Irving
Heningson and Cy Oberg, tackles;
John Partridge and Jay Holridge,
guards; and Nelly Heath, center. In
(he backfield will be "Tex" Luckett,
Bill Paulman, Ed Gillette, and either
Leo Madlem or Tom Collins.
Collins is '38's Grayson, even to
the walk. Sideline fans are watch
ing him closely, knowing him to be
