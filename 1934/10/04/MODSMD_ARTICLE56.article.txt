### 
The lithographic exhibit is attract
ing wide attention in the graphic
art department. The nucleus of the
display is five prints put out last
year by the Contemporary Print So
ciety as indicative of modern trends.
One of the drawings is by George
Grosz, the German satirist famous
for his very bitter drawings made
after the war; another is by Adolf
Dehm, the American satirist. There
is also a negro lynching scene by
Diego Riviera's fellow-worker, Oroz
co, the Mexican mural painter whose
decorations at Dartmouth recently
caused much comment. "Now York
er's" illustrator, Reginald Marsh, has
some work in the exhibit, as also has
Rockwell Kent.
As it was necessary to enlarge the
display, Art Professors Farmer,
Mendelowitz, and White produced
some original work and obtained
some creations of local artists which
have been put on show.
Subjects on exhibition include
landscapes, figures, etc. Done on
stone plate rather than metal, lithog
lc.phy is a print medium which is
being revived with enormous suc
cess.
