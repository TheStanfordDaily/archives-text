# 75 SOCCER PLAYERS ANSWER WHISTLE OF MALONEY FOR TRYOUT SCRIMMAGE
## 
### 
One of the largest turnouts in the
history of Stanford soccer answered
Coach Harry Maloney's whistle yes
terday afternoon as 75 old and new
players donned uniforms and re
ported for first practice.
Twenty-three of the number were
frosh who turned out with the var
sity for the first day. For the next
two weeks both squads will have
daily turnouts with stiff scrimmage
to prepare for the conference sched
ule which starts within two weeks.
Setting-up exercises, dribble prac
tice and a ten-minute scrimmage
session comprised yesterday's prac
tice activities. Tonight both varsity
and frosh will work out separately,
the yearling men under the direc
tion of John Moore with the varsity
directed by Maloncy.
Sparked by Captain Waddy White
in the center half back berth, the
tentative first squad in their first
performance showed good promise of
being able to get themselves in fair
shape for the practice game which
will be played with San Jose State
Saturday.

! Maloney intends to build his '34
' squad around White, Kennedy
1 Gomez and Gonzalez, the only re
i turning lettermen.
John Moore expressed himself as
i fairly well pleased with the frosh
i turnout which included a large num
| ber of players who have had pre
l vious experience. Many newcomers
| to soccer, both varsity and fresh
-1 men, appeared to try their hands at
I (he game for the first time.
