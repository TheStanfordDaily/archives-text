# Vanderbilt Relatives Rush To Deny Court Charges
## 
### 
NE WYORK, Oct. 2 OP). â€” The
Vanderbilt-Whitney court battle for
possession of little Gloria Vanderbilt
apparently headed for a finish fight
tonight as a brother and sister of
Mrs. Gloria Morgan Vanderbilt ar
ranged to rush from Paris to deny
charges she is an unfit mother for
the $4,000,000 heiress.
Adjournment of hearings in the
sensational case until Friday brought
conjecture on a possible settlement,
but it was promptly denied.
Justice Carew had cleared the
courtroom of spectators and news
papermen yesterday after a French
maid had told of an incident at
Cannes involving Mrs. Vanderbilt
and Lady Milford Haven.
Crowds were still at the court to
day, trying to gain entrance. By
virtue of the adjournment, Justice
Carew was relieved temporarily of
deciding whether future sessions
would be open to the public.
