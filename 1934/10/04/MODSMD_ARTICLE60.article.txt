, j
During summer quarter at ihe
University, the Department of Eco- j
nomics devised a plan analogous 1o
the Harvard tradition of holding a
reading period before examinations.
According to the system used here, ,
students met their professors the |
first eight weeks of the quarter and
studied independently the last two
| weeks. The method worked satis- j
factorily in the economics classes.
j Visiting Professor W. L. Crum of .
Harvard offered courses in contem- ,
{ porary economics problems and in J
! corporation finance.
Professor R. D. McKenzie, head i
j of the Department of Sociology at
the University of Michigan, taught
, human ecology and a seminar in
population and race problems. I

Mr. Francis Mclntyre, '31, who has
been doing graduate work at the
University of Chicago as a research
assistant in economics, is a new in
structor at the University. He will
give courses in mathematical eco- ,
nomics and in advanced statistics.
These courses are now in the De
partment of Economics and are for
advanced students.
