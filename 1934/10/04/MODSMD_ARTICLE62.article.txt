BEAR CLAIMS
WILL Ilr: TESTED
We've been hearing a lot about
California's Golden Bears, but so far
it's all been talk. This week-end, the
Bears will bo able to back up boasts
and predictions. They play St.
Mary's, and A1 Nichelini and the
rest of the Moragans will be tough, i
in about tlie same way Santa Clara
was tough.
This writer is inclined to believe
most of the talk emitting from the
Berkeley campus, and consequently
reserves California as a favorite to
beat the Gaels, who are pretty anx
ious to divert this happening. .. .
But at any rate, Saturday should
cither hack up or ridicule the Cali
fornia prospects, which have been
very little but talk to date.
For example, concerning the Cal.
Aggies and Nevada double header
with the Bears last Saturday, Navy
Bill demanded "eighty points or
bust." California scored 87 digits.
What of it? Although California is
probably good, the 87 points mean
about as much as if they'd been
scored in a scrimmage with the sixth
team.
PORTLAND PROUD
OF TIIE BOOMER
it will be Grayson day in Portland
Saturday, by proclamation of the
northwest city at large. Stanford
and Oregon State tangle in the after
noon at Multnomah Stadium, and the
fans will utilize the day in doing
honor to one of their more famous
football soils, as Bobby leads the
Cardinals in their conference opener.
Grayson, himself doesn't seem to
think so much of the idea.
it should also be Grayson day
by proclamation of the Stanford
football team. During the past year
most football days have come to
that. But particularly will Gray
son be anxious to give his fans
something to really talk about
while in the home town.
For this year at least, big-headed
ness will be unknown to the Cardinal
varsity. Except for a few points, last
year's record would give every rea
son for the old trouble setting in.
FIXTURES WON'T
BE CONCEITED
In the first place, however, there
are just a few members of the squad
who are really fixtures on the first
team. And these few are the ones
that are after all-Coast and ail-
American distinction. They have yet
to prove their record for all-star
greatness, inasmuch as they are all
juniors and received very little men
tion last year. Consequently they
will not be bothered with undue
conceit, at least not until after the
season.
Then, as far as the remaining
members of the first eleven are con
cerned, there will be little trouble,
for the reason that there arc too
many second and third string men
ready, and almost good enough, to
lake their places at any given time.
The team as a whole, although
rated tops on the coast, has given
every evidence to date this year of
being very modest about this post.
Last Saturday's game will only serve
to enhance this modesty. So. for sev
eral reasons, Coach Tiny Thornhill
will not be troubled with big-head
edness.
