# CARD WATER POLO TEAMS ENGAGE IN HARD SCRIMMAGE
##

Looking forward to the season's
first game, to be played with the
Lakeside Athletic Club in less than
two weeks, the Card varsity water
polo team is engaging in hard work
outs. Condition will be of great im
portance in the first games.
One change which promises to
strengthen the Stanford scoring
power is the shift of Captain Leo
Cook from goal guard to forward. At
this position his sharp-shooting abil
ity will be used to the best advan
tage. With either hand, the huge
Indian leader shoots at the goal with
bullet-like speed.
Taranik at Sprint
At the sprint position. Vlad Tara- j
nik, high-scoring ace of the 1933-34
season, will be another constant
threat to the opposition. Captain
elect Bob Foster of the swimming
team is leading in the race for the j
other forward post.
Other candidates for this berth in
clude Bill Clemo, junior college i
transfer, and Ben Voss, Bob Hoover,
and Bob Etienne from last year's j
great frosh team.
Three Guards Back .... j
Three fine guards return this year j
I in the persons of Wally Wiget, Bill j
Woodard, and Jim Benet. Hunt i
Kingsbury, Bob Harris, Bob Suther- j
, land, Pat Pearson, Martin Scatena, |
and "Dee" Myers are all giving them
close competition. Bob Haslacher is
the leading goalie at present.
With Cook and Taranik heading
the parade, Coach Nort Thornton's,
splashers have gone on several
scoring sprees in recent practices.
Thornton's aim is to eliminate the
ragged teamwork and poor physical
condition within the next two weeks.
Passing, shooting, guarding, and long
scrimmages are being stressed in
these practice sessions.

any prospective stars among the huge
number of yearlings out, about a

varying degrees of skill in ball
handling.

' Bill Hannah, stars with reputations,
these men included "Hall, Wilson, Os

first game, to be played with the
Lakeside Athletic Club in less than
two weeks, the Card varsity water
polo team is engaging in hard work
outs. Condition will be of great im
portance in the first games.
One change which promises to
strengthen the Stanford scoring
power is the shift of Captain Leo
Cook from goal guard to forward. At
this position his sharp-shooting abil
ity will be used to the best advan
tage. With either hand, the huge
Indian leader shoots at the goal with
bullet-like speed.
Taranik at Sprint
At the sprint position. Vlad Tara- j
nik, high-scoring ace of the 1933-34
season, will be another constant
threat to the opposition. Captain
elect Bob Foster of the swimming
team is leading in the race for the j
other forward post.
Other candidates for this berth in
clude Bill Clemo, junior college i
transfer, and Ben Voss, Bob Hoover,
and Bob Etienne from last year's j
great frosh team.
Three Guards Back .... j
Three fine guards return this year j
I in the persons of Wally Wiget, Bill j
Woodard, and Jim Benet. Hunt i
Kingsbury, Bob Harris, Bob Suther- j
, land, Pat Pearson, Martin Scatena, |
and "Dee" Myers are all giving them
close competition. Bob Haslacher is
the leading goalie at present.
With Cook and Taranik heading
the parade, Coach Nort Thornton's,
splashers have gone on several
scoring sprees in recent practices.
Thornton's aim is to eliminate the
ragged teamwork and poor physical
condition within the next two weeks.
Passing, shooting, guarding, and long
scrimmages are being stressed in
these practice sessions.
FROSII CANDIDATES
BATTLE FOR SQUAD POSTS
Coach Nort Thornton's frosh
water polo candidates will engage
in their first scrimmage this after
noon. The last two days have been
devoted to fundamentals, with em
phasis on handling of the ball.
I Although it was hard to pick out
any prospective stars among the huge
number of yearlings out, about a
dozen impressed Thornton with
varying degrees of skill in ball
handling.
Besides Jack Loupe, Bill Teich, and
' Bill Hannah, stars with reputations,
these men included "Hall, Wilson, Os
borne, Kahn, Hornleigh, Wagonheim,
Simoes, Paddock, Stoddard, Hart
> man, and Smith.
