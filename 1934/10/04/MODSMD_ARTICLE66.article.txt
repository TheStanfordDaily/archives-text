# Touch-football Starts New Intramural Series
## 
### 
Expectancy that the intramural
program being planned by Manager
Marvin Kahn will exceed all others
in attracting a turnout of men was
voiced today in intramural circles,
as preparations to start the new year
wilh the fouch-football champion
ships progressed rapidly today.
Greater ease of entering the com
petition. more enthusiasm for sport,
and the larger registration were cited
as reasons to believe that this year
would draw more than the 1110 men
from 57 organizations of last year.
Kahn urged today that all organi
zations elect managers of their sport
teams in order to facilitate the ar
rangement of game dates and to
carry off the program more smoothly
than ever before.
Kahn pointed out that all regis
tered men are eligible for compe
tition, whether on off-campus, row,
hall, or independent teams. The
intramural manager was certain that
every athletically inclined man
would find the incentive to form a
team for competition in at least one
of the sports which have been ar
ranged.
The sports offered between the
time touch-football inaugurates play
and late next spring quarter when
the program ends are: football, golf,
handball, track and field, swimming,
basketball, tennis, horseshoes, base
ball, and the relay carnival â€”offered
in the order named.
A feature of last spring, the com
petition to decide the all-around
champion of the University in sport
will probably be taken over and con
tinued under intramural athletics
this season.
Last year Sigma Nu staged e
strong finish to carry off the intra
mural title hands-clown. Coachec
and managed by Bud Shreve, the
boys from the hill were potent ir
almost all ten sports and scored
points, winning the football, baseball
and horseshoe titles and threatening

in basketball and in the relay car
nival.
In touch football Sigma Nu out
scored the crack A.T.O. outfit in the
second play-off game last year, after
the first game for the championship
ended in a (J to (3 tie. Later on the
same Sigma Nil's proved the class of
the baseball teams by beating Alpha
Delts 13 to 1 in the final.
An informative red book put out
by the School of Hygiene and Physi
cal Education is available in the
B.A.C. building. Intricate details of
intramural organization are ex
plained in the booklet, which con
tains a record of last year's stand
ings showing El Toro and Alpha
Delta Phi as close runners-up to
Sigma Nu.
