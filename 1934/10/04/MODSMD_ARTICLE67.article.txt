# Tom Dwyer Blasts Par; Equals Indian Record
## 
### 
As the qualifying rounds for posi
tions on the Stanford golf team
opened yesterday afternoon, "Old
Man Par" started his new season
with a smashing defeat as Tom
Dwyer shot a 68. This figure ties
the course record set last year by
Stanford's still wandering interna
tional champion Lawson Little.
Three under par for the round,
Dwyer clipped one stroke from the
first nine's perfect figures and burnt
up the second with a 33—two under.
The only other qualifying round
that was played yesterday brought
Dennis Hession into the limelight as
another threat. Hession entered
school from Sacramento Junior Col
lege last spring.
Judging from the two cards turned
in to date, the Stanford golf team
will be better this year than it has I
ever been. Dwyer seems to be in i
great form and an almost certain !
number two man but he still has i
another round to play and anything
might happen. There are many golf
ers on the campus who might crash
through those figures at any time.
Jack Hoerner, Don Edwards, Spec
Stewart, and Dan Moser have all
shot scores equal to that on other
courses.
