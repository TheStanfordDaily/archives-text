# HALF YEAR OF CAPITAL-LABOR TRUCE NEARING
## Roosevelt industrial Peace Plan Backed Solidly By Textile Workers 
### 
WASHINGTON. Oct. 3 (/P).—The
organized textile workers lined up
solidly today behind President Roo
sevelt's capital-labor truce proposal,
suggesting a six months' armistice,
hut warnin that "renewal of con
flict" was imminent unless the peace
ful methods suggested by the exec
utive could be brought into "swift
and effective action."
Roosevelt Goes On
Roosevelt, hopeful for an end to
industrial disputes, continues his
conferences on the peace plan and
recovery measures in general. He
conferred with Wm. C. Potter, New
York banker-industrialist; Senator
Wagner, Democrat, New York, au
thor of much of the administration's
labor legislation, and Hugh S. John
son, former NRA chief.
At his press conference the chief
executive also announced that con
sideration was being given to pos
sible changes in the minimum wage
clauses of NRA codes. The idea in
m.'i'.d, he indicated, was to spread
production so as to guarantee a liv
ing annual wage. He related in
stances where some workers in the
automobile industry were getting a
good hourly or daily wage, but
worked only a few months a year.
Gorman Accepts
In the first normal acceptance of
the President's industrial peace plan,
Francis J. Gorman, vice-president of
the United Textile Workers, wrote
Roosevelt that the textile workers
were willing to enter into a half
year truce.
During that time, Gorman said, the
union would permit "no stoppage of
work" in protest against any findings
of the textile or national labor rela
tions boards."
While offering "wholehearted co
operation" in working out the pro
posed hour, wage and working con
ditions agreements with industry
and expressing the hope manage
ments could be "persuaded" to fol
low a similar course, Gorman said
thousands of employes were being
denied re-employment because they
were on strike, despite the Presi
dent's plea that they be taken back
without discrimination.
