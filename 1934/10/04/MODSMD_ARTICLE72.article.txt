ing the greater part of the summer.
"The college is divided into two
parts: one on the top of the island
of Manhattan; the other, downtown
in Washington Square, is where I
was situated," Professor Hulme said.
"On the other .side of the Square
is the erstwhile Bohemian district,
Greenwich Village.
"The New York University is
