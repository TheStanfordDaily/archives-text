### 
NAVIN FIELD, DEROIT, Oct. 4
(/P), â€”Goose Goslin's single to cen
ter in the 12th inning today gave
lyn "Schoolboy" Rowe a brilliant 3
to 2 conquest of the* St. Louis Card
inals and put the Detroit Tigers on
even terms in the World Series,
with one win for each club. The
winning run scored Charley Gehrin
ger from second base.
Goslin's decisive smash was off
the left-handed relief pitcher, Bill
Walker. Gehringer, who had walked
and taken second when Hank Green
berg walked, ran home with the run
that decided a close, stirring duel
and one of the longest World Series
games in history.

The Boston Red Sox held the dis
tance record with a 2 to 1, 14-inning
defeat of the Brooklyn Dodgers in
the 1916 series, a game that Babe
Ruth pitched for the Red Sox.
All Knotted Lip
The victory not only sent the
Tigers into the second phase of the
series all even, but established the
pitching mastery of "Schoolboy"
Rowe, 22-year-old right hander, who
allowed the Cardinals only one hit
in tho last nine innings, a double by
Pepper Martin in the 11th inning,
after a one-run rally in the ninth
inning drove Bill Hallahan, St. Louis
hero of the 1931 series, from the
game.
Hallahan, pitching superb ball
himself, had allowed only four hits,
three of them flukey, in the first
eight innings but weakened in the
ninth and lost his 2 to 1 lead when
Pete Fox, Detroit, right fielder, who
had driven in the first run for De
troit, singled and was sacrificed to
second by Rowe.. Fox scored the tie
ins run on a single to center by Ger
ald Walker, pinch-hitting for Jo-Jo
White.

Bill Walker came in then and
helped catch Gerald Walker in the
run-down off first base and then
