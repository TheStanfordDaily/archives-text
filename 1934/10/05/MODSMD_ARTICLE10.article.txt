# 'This Guy Algar' Gets Disney Job By Lucky Break
## 
### 
Jimmy Algar, last year's Old
Boy of the Chappie offices who
is now working for the Walt
Disney studio in Hollywood,
fell right into a job he didn't
ask for. Here's how:
Another former Chappie artist
applied to Disney for a position,
taking with him copies of
Chaparral which contained his
work.
The producer looked the mag
azine over, glanced up, and
said, "Nope, we can't use you,
but who's this guy Algar? Send
him around."
