# DROUGHT GRIPS CHINA

### 
NANKING, Oct. 4 (A I ) â€” Crop losses
of at least $200,000,000 were caused
by the drought which gripped vast
areas of China during the summer
months. This is the estimate of
the national agricultural research
bureau, a government organization.
The crop expectancy in the affected
districts is placed at 40 per cent or
less. Some crops, such as rice, corn,
cotton and peanuts, have been prac
tically wiped out in the drought
regions.

There is a great resemblance be
tween the heart of a frog and that
of man.
