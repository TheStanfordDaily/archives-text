# Iraq Students Declare R.O.T.C. Favorite Course
## 
### 
Five men came all the way from
Iraq to study hydraulics and pe
troleum engineering at U.C.L.A.
That in itself is news.
But the five declared unanimously
that R.O.T.C. was their most inter
esting course! (It is compulsory at
U.C.L.A.)
Other phases of campus life which
meet their approval are the student
newspaper, strangely enough, and
the various sports.
All five declare they are not home
sick but admit that it does seem
queer to know that it is midnight
in one's homeland when it is high
noon on the U.C.L.A. quad.
