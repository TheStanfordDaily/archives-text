# RICHBERG HITS NRA STAND ON PRICE PEGGING
## NRA Head Hints Change Imminent in Set-up For Recovery 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 4 (/P).—Un- j
covering a probable change of course |
for NRA, Donald R. Richberg, the |
President's recovery co-ordinator, I
advised American business today to !
leave the "lopsided guild socialism" I
of price fixing and production con- j
trol in favor of "the old competitive !
system."
He labeled an "irridescent dream"
the belief of some industrialists that
permanent prosperity can be ob
tained throuh the price fixing, pro
duction limiting method. At the
same time he asserted such prac
tices were justified in emergencies
to prevent the waste of natural re
sources.
No Price Fixing
These statements, coming from the :
direction of the policy committee
which is directing the blue eagle's
course, wer interpreted immediately
as pointing away from fixed prices
and limited production in NRA codes.
The vadual reopening of all major
codes on these issues was forecast, j
Business men themselves, Rich- j
berg said, had been thoroughly i
"disillusioned" in a year of code ap- j
plication in the price and produc- <
tion control they desired. These'
same industrial ranks frankly were |
questioning the wisdom of their'
own provisions, he added. He pro- !
iected a process of working out the |
good in codes "industry by indus- j
try."
So important was Richberg's first j
declaration of policy considered that
dozens of officials mingled with j
newspaper men at a specially ar- I
ranged luncheon at the National !
Press Club to hear his words. His
statement undoubtedly carried Mr. ;
Roosevelt's approval.
Richberg Laughs
Introduced as the present "No. 1 |
man of the new deal" and "poobah I
of the Roosevelt Administration," \
he mixed a laugh with the more j
significant section of his address, j
saying:
"General Johnson said his job at |
NRA was like mounting the guillo- j
tine and betting the ax wouldn't !
drop. I'm betting it will drop, but |
my official head will go with a ■
smile."
There were other major develop- |
ments in the business field during |
the day. Shortly before Richberg ]
spoke, President oosevelt was given i
assurances by Francis Law, presi- |
dent of the American Bankers' As- j
sociation, that "the banks of this j
country by and large are in a good,!
sound and strong position."
