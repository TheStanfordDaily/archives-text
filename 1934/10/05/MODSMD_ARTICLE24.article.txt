# JONES WRITES ON NOTED MEN
## Daily To Print Comments On Nation's Executives 
### 
Men of note, ten of them—head
lined names' and faces that have been
splashed across the front pages of
newspapers and on the movie
screens of the nation—will receive a
personal introduction to the Stan
ford student body in the next several
weeks.
"The Man Behind the Name" is
the title of a series of interviews
which were written by Bob Jones
while travelling in the East last
spring after being forced to recuper
ate from a serious accident at school
last winter. He has written his own
impressions of the kinds of men that
are running the government during
the New Deal. His opinions are not
colored by any party obligation of
his own nor of any political com
mentators of the day.
After gaining access to these men
by letters of introduction, Jones
chatted with each of them for 20
minutes, always forming his own
opinion of the man he was facing.
To be revealed will be President
Roosevelt, A1 Smith, Secretary of
State Hull, Will Irwin, writer, Sec
retary of Commerce Roper, Gover
nor Lehman of New York, Post
master-General Farley, Walter
Lippman, Mayor LaGuardia of New
york City, and Warden Lawes and
his "boys" of Sing Sing.
Jones is a junior at Stanford and
is returning to work this quarter as
a night editor of the Daily. Monday
morning his personal glimpses of
the men behind the scenes of our
government will start with an inter
view with the man of the decade,
Franklin D. Roosevelt.
