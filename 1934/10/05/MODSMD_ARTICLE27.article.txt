# CARDS FAVORED OVER STUBBORN BEAVER ELEVEN
## Red Franklin Looms as Lone Oregon Threat Against Cardinal Victory LINE-UPS RELEASED Indians Free from Injuries For Conference Tilt 
### 
Oregon State may hold the score
down, but they won't build it up.
This is the consensus of local
opinion, as Stanford's Indian band
of 34 speeds northward toward its
first conference football test with the
Corvallis eleven in Portland tomor
row.
As the favored, but not too heavily
favored Cardinals approach, the
Beaver camp, headed by Coach Lou
Stiner, is thinking mostly in terms
of defense, with only an occasional
offensive dream.
Oregon State would be easy to
penetrate, and would be no scoring
threat at all, were it not for one Red
Franklin who will appear in a Bea
ver halfback position.
Franklin Big Shot
As it is, however, the Northwest
erners will be stubborn—very, very
stubborn —as the Indian machine
opens its goalward motion.
Franklin, one of the Coast's prin
cipal candidates for all-American
honors, is capable of many things,
and he alone may do a lot in halt
ing Cardinal scoring thrusts. He is
an outstanding punter, and handles
the other end well, by running back
opposing kicks for good yardage.
His guarding of the safety position
has in past games been practically
flawless. Defensively, Franklin can
be quite helpful all alone.
The Beaver star, behind a good
line, would be one of the country's
outstanding triple threat men. But
with an otherwise fairly weak squad
behind him, he is not considered a
scoring 4hf*»"C"ed men.
Team Arrives Today
The Stanford squad left yester
day afternoon at 2 o'clock and will
arrive in Portland at noon today in
time for a brief limbering-up this
afternoon.
The game, marking Stanford's in
itial away-from-home appearance of
the season, will be played in Mult
nomah Stadium, starting at 2:30
o'clock Saturday. It will be broad
cast.
As the train was leaving yesterday,
Thornhill announced the following
tentative starting lineup:
Ends—Monk Moscrip and Keith
Topping.
Tackles—Boh Reynolds and Claude
Callaway.
Guards—Larry Rouble and Woody
Adams.
Center—Alf Brandin or Niels Lar
sen.
Quarterback —Frank Alustiza.
Halfbacks—Bob Maentz and Bones
Hamilton.
Ful 1 back—Bobby Grayson.
Brandin has been out of practice
with sinus trouble and a cold most
of the week, but he has recovered
enough to make the trip, and he
will be ready to start unless the trip
retards his physical improvement.
Wes Muller, 1933 regular, was the
third center who made the trip. He
will be in shape for a few minutes
of play, but definitely will not start,
Thornhill said. Muller is recuperat
ing from a shoulder injury of three
weeks' standing.
The Indian coach said Maentz
probably would be used at left half
back again this week instead of Buck
Van Dellen, who finished last sea
son and opened the present schedule
with the first eleven. >
Maentz will work at safety while
he is in. with Van Dellen taking over
the back position when he relieves
Maentz.
Harry Carlson, reserve, who
sprained an ankle in scrimmage on
Wednesday, was not included in the
traveling squad, and Thornhill add
ed Johnny Grant, transfer tackle, to
the team at the last minute yester
day.
The remainder of the team will be
free from injuries for the game, with
Hamilton, troubled this week with
a skin infection, and Alustiza, who
has been carrying a bruised side for
the past fortnight, both ready for
full action.
Besides those asigned to the start
ing eleven, the following entrained
yesterday.
Ends — Jack Clark, Carlos Mon
salvc, Carl Schott, and Alex Trom
pas; tackles—Ben Palamountain, Ed
Lettunich. Jack Drown, and Grant;

Bob Fowler, and Jack Walton; full
backs and quarterbacks—Earl Hoos,
