Yesterday's Daii.y carried a short report
of a conversation that took place between two*
freshmen in the Assembly Hall, a story of
I;wo students who thought they were listen
ing to a really grand fellow talk to them about
Stanford.
Dr. Wilbur is the speaker, and the names
of the two men are not known. They repre
sent, however, a type of individual who is not
wanted at Stanford. The type who signs, up
for a good lecture course, .attends each lec
ture, and hears every third or fourth word.
The story itself is one thai should not have
been printed, and in the disorganization that
marked the opening of the quarter it some
how managed to gel into type. For that the
Daily is sorry. II is too late to retract the
content, yet il shows what the student who
is just "attending Stanford" actually profits
by so doing.
Dr. Wilbur said one thing. A student didn't
hear, asked his neighbor. His neighbor heard
one or two words and managed to twist the
original idea into a grotesque, libelous,
Ihoughtless statement.
To Mrs. Wilbur, the Daily offers apology
for the report. To the name of Stanford, the
Daily oilers hope that such men will not con
tinue to be Stanford men.
