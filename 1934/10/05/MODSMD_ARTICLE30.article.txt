# Look 'Em Over, Frosh

Phi Beta Kappa, most honored of all colle
giate honor societies, will once again be the
goal of a large number of seriously inclined
youug freshmen as the 1934 academic season
gets under way.
To discourage so scholarly an ambition is
a questionable and possibly unworthy object.
For education is, beneath all the gilt and tinsel
of the rah-rah life, the real reason for the
existence of the modern university. That
should be self-evident, of course, but it is
sometimes necessary to remind ourselves of
the fact.
Nevertheless a word of warning is in order
regarding Phi Betes. They should be looked
over and judged accordingly. In their ranks
will be found many likeable, highly intelligent,
well-balanced men and women, equipped to
meet successfully all the problems that life
has to offer.
On the other hand there are many one-sided,
narrow individuals whose sole equipment in
meeting the battles of life is the ability to sit
down before an open book and through sheer
mental grinding transfer the contents of the
printed page into their own unproductive
minds. Such training had best be left in the
textbooks from whence it comes.
It you are of the serious turn of mind that
makes Phi Beta Kappa seem all-important
then perhaps Phi Beta Kappa is the thing that
you least need. You already have the mental
equipment that makes Phi Betes. If such is
the case, then it would probably be best to turn
to something a bit more broadening. Try ath
letics, activities, social life.
A well-rounded education has many aspects,
of which scholastic honor is but one. If Phi
Iset;i Kappa can be obtained without sacrific
ing other valuable things, then Phi Beta Kappa
is worth while. Otherwise its value is doubtful.
