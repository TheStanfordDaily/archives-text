' II may have boon merely an oversight on
I lie purl of Ihe committee in charge of Tues
day's Itegistration Dance, I mll several inter
esting placards were noted in the Women's
(ivninasi 11 m al various spols thai evening.

One that confronted the dancing couples
during intermissions read "Station ."> Exami
nation of Feet Mere." Well, that's awfully ac
comodating of a committee desirous of going
out of its way to make things pleasant for
everybody. Somebody even provided a modern
set of scales for latest check-up of weights,
presumably before and after each number.
How many pounds did you lose?
II il were the Bug House or something simi
lar at an amusement park, it might have been
even more successful. But when it is learned
that the novelties (lots of them) just "hap
pened to be there" because the building hadn't
even been looked over alter the morning's
physical examination for women, one awaits
with interest the first of the promised A.S.S.T.
dances with plenty of fun for the money.
