## SUMMER SEASON AT STANFORD 
### 
The summer at Stanford was unusually rich in
plays and concerts. The most notably even 4 of the
summer quarter was the presentation of .six concerts
by the famous Pro Arte String Quartet. These, a gift
to Stanford from Mrs. Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge.
presented the Beethoven Quartet Cycle.
The play of the quarter was "The Doctor's Wife,"
a fii'st play by a Palo Alto physician, Dr. Edward
Listoi., writing under the pen name of Eric Linders.
Dr. Margery Bailey starred in a part which suited her
completely, and she was supported by an able cast of
which Shelley Smith, William Gwinn, and Frank
O'Neill were outstanding members. The play itself
showed a good deal of promise, and with a deal of
judicious cutting and revising might make Broadway
material. What it lacked in plot it made up in sparkling
and witty dialogue.
The three play readings which Sword and Sandals
presented during the quarter were uniformly success
fuh- The first was Somerset Maugham's "The Circle,"
a comedy problem-drama. In this, also, Dr. Bailey had
the most important role, but for acting honors she was
closely crowded by Robert Brauns and Dorothy Tully.
The second play reading was ''The Rivals" of Rich
ard Brinsley Sheridan. Myna Hughes and James
Sandoe, as Mrs. Malaprop and "Fighting Bob" Acres,
respectively, carried off the laugh honors of the evening.
Sandoe has the happy faculty of interpreting mouse
like men in a manner that convulses audiences.
The last Sword and Sandals presentation was Ros
tand's "L'Aiglon," in a more serious mood. Robert
Brauns gave what may easily have been the best,
performance of his career in the title role of Napoleon's
son. His acting reached the heights of excellence in
many places.
James Sandoe abandoned his portfolio of comic char
acters to play the cunning Metternich, unscrupulous
Austrian chancellor. His, too, was a really fine por
trayal. A. Grove Day, Frank O'Neill, and Thomas
Seller were the outstanding members of a uniformly
good supporting cast.
In the musical line, besides the Pro Arte Concerts
and the regular organ recitals, there were three special
events. Early in the quarter G. Marston Haddock,
acting instructor in public speaking during the sum
mer, took the leading role in a presentation of an eight
eenth century English ballad-opera, "Love in a Vil
lage," given in the exaggeratedly serious style of "The
Drunkard." Also during July there were recitals by
Kenneth Spencer, a young negro basso who has been
much heard on the radio in San Francisco, and by
Ernest Bacon, well-known pianist. Both of these
concerts were thoroughly enjoyable.
Under a miscellaneous heading all its own comes
the performance of "Cinderella" by Perry Dilley's
puppets. These little guignols gave a better end more
entertaining performance than sometimes comes from
humans.
During the summer the Palo Alto Community Play
ers piesented three plays with a part-Stanford cast:
"Escape," by John Galsworthy; Oscar Wilde's "Lady
Windermere's Fan"; and "Louder, Please," by the Hol
lywood scenarist, Norman Krasna.
All in all, it was a most entertaining summer. Your
"critic" settles back with a satisfied sigh and awaits
the entertainment which fall may offer,
