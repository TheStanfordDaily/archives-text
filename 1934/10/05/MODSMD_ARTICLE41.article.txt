## MAKING JOLLY-UPS MORE JOLLY, MORE UPPY 
### 
Advice is as much fun to give as
castor-oil, and usually as hard to
take. Consequently few people ever
really want advice, and many people
are iven it. Yet there are excep
tions, especially at Stanford. The
Roble Dance Chairman has asked
for advice on jolly-ups. She has
invited the whole campus to join in
a delightful orgy of advice-giving.
To start the ball rolling, we accept
the invitation.

The worse thing about Roble jolly
ups was that they were held in
Roble. The place was never meant
for jolly-ups, but rather for pink tea
and mellowed chamber music. Ro
ble, on a jolly-up night, resembled
nothing so much as the Chicago
stockyards shortly after the Texas
round-up. And nothing was ever
stranger than to watch couples in
the South dining room dance mer
rily around, blissfully unaware of
the fact that the music in the lobby
had long since ceased. But that is
over with. Jolly-ups will be in the
.Women's Gym; for which —orchids.

Albeit, thei'e are still a few sug
gestions. One thing that makes a
jolly-up l'esemble more a Bowery
Brawl than a Stanford get-together
is the too-rapid change of partners.
To cut before the Stanford Rough
has fully seized his Stanford Maid
is not jolly, and certainly not cricket.
Ten steps is little enough, but should
be allowed. We suggest a iftiiform
signal — fist clenched, with thumb
downward—to carry the important
message.
* * *
Conversely, a still greater evil of
jolly-ups is the too slow change oi
partners. No one —man or woman—
who has ever been "stuck." with a
halitosic or otherwise discordant
companion will believe this criticism
paradoxical. To remedy which situ
ation we suggest a grand split-up
every few minutes. This would be
customary; and no one would be
insulted. It would make men more
daring. And consequently more
women would dance—which would

' make everyone happier, jollier.

Some one suggests that there i
should be more spangles on the !
floor, which appears to be a valid j
criticism —even though we are not
sure we would recognize a spangle i
if introduced to one. The lady says '
the floor would be slicker, jollier.
« * *
Lastly, seven o'clock is too early j
for jolly-ups to begin. Seven-fifteen !
or seven-thirty would allow more
time for peaceful digestion of din
ner. and peaceful preparation of j
milady's toilette.
* * *
Thus we hail the 1934 season of |
jollier, uppier jolly-ups..
