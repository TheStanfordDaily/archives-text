# DWYER AHEAD AS TRY-OUTS CONTINUE FOR VARSITY GOLF
## 
### 
Fifteen men teed off yesterday j
afternoon at the Stanford golf
course in the qualifying for the j
, Stanford team with the idea of .
i breaking through or matching Tom i
Dwyer's remarkable 68. shot on |
Wednesday afternoon.
Those who qualified yesterday j
afternoon were hampered by a slight j
wind from the ocean. The rest of
the aspirants for the squad were '
content to practice preparing to do j
their best to match Dwyer's great
bid. Their success or failure will
| not be officially known until after !
all qualifying is completed next I
Wednesday afternoon.
If Dwyer's position is to be men- j
| aced, that threat will probably ap- ;
! pear today when Don Edwards, Jack ;
1 Hoerner, Spec Stewart and Dan I
Moser will play their initial rounds i
in the competition. In the practice j
during the week Edwards has shown
himself the most likely, for the past :
week shooting close to par.
Americans bet $5,000,000,000 an
nually on foreign lotteries and il
j legal pools.
