# Psych Profs Take Part In Eastern Meet
## Hilgard, Strong, and Stone Present Papers At National Conclave 
### 
Psychology Professors Ernest R.
Hilgard, Edward K. Strong, and Cal
vin Perry Stone attended the forty
second annual meeting of the Amer
ican Psychological Association, held
from September 5 to 8 at New York
City's Columbia University.
Material for Professor Hilgard's
paper on "The Retention of Condi
tioned Responses" was derived from
research carried on last year at :
Stanford with Mr. Albert A. Camp
bell, assistant in psychology. The !
research work proved conclusively
that conditioned eye-lid reactions,
usually thought to be temporary,
persist over periods of time as long
as 20 weeks.
Interests Discussed
"Interests of Men and Women"
were expounded by Professor
Strong, Jr. Professor Strong main
tains that with increasing age, both
sexes become more feminine in in- !
terest and, to a slight extent, more
similar.
The paper continues: "farmers and
engineers have the most masculine
interests; advertising men, journal
ists, ministers, and lawyers, the most
feminine interests; while ministers, !
teachers, Y.M.C.A. secretaries and
school superintendents have the
most matui-e interests."
Professor Terman 111
A joint paper was given by Pro
fessor Stone and Research Associate
Roger G. Barker, on certain changes
in intelligence tests, personality I
scores, etc., during the adolescent ;
period.

planned to give a paper on the rela
tionship between some personality
test scores and marital compatibility,
but was prevented delivering it by j
illness. Preparation for the paper i
involved a study of 350 married and |
150 divorced couples.
Also present at the meeting was j
Dr. Quinn McNemar, instructor in i
psychology at the University, who j
returns to Stanford this quarter from j
a year's leave of absence as a Social i
