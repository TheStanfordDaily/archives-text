# DELAY SOUGHT IN LINDY TRIAL
## Attorney Says Extradition Order Will Be Fought 
### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 4 (IP).— Delay
in the trial of Bruno Hauptmann, in
dicted for extorting $50,000 ransom
fruitlessly paid by Colonel Charles
A. Lindbergh for his kidnaped first
born's return, will be asked by his
counsel, James M. Fawcett. The at
torney declared today he would
resist any attempts to extradite the
alien ex-convict for trial on the
baby's abduction and death.
His statement followed a disclos
ure by District Attorney Samuel
Foley of the Bronx that Hauptmann
had in his possession maps of per
tinent areas in the abduction.
Memorizes Maps
Foley said Hauptmann had por
trayed from memory minute details
of these maps.
"We absolutely will resist," Faw
cett said, "any effort the State of
New Jersey may make to extradite
this defendant.
"There has been such a mass of j
detail to be sifted that, in the short
time at our disposal, it is difficult to
prepare for trial. We are seeking to
delay the case only in the interest
of justice."
Will Co-operate
Fawcett reiterated his intention to
co-operate in every phase of the
investigation with authorities, add
ing:
"I get a great mass of information
every day. All leads and informa
tion are being turned over to officials
of the Department of Justice, so that
they can investigate. We hope by
working with them, to obtain true
solution to the case."
The trial is docketed for next
Thursday.
Foley said the maps were found
in a trunk at the Hauptmann home.
Nine English - German dictionaries
were found. v
Select Jury
Coupled with this strengthening
of the chain of circumstantial evi
dence linking Hauptmann to the
kidnaping, Bronx County officials
started drawing the special venire
of 150 persons to try the tight-lipped
stowaway from Germany.
District Attorney Foley attached
equal importance both to the dis
covery of the maps and the diction
aries. From the outset it has been
the theory of investigators that the
writer of the ransom notes — and
these have been identified by ex
perts as of Hauptmann's handwriting
—had used a dictionary for the
spelling of the long English words.
Misspells Words
In the notes, the longer words
generally were correctly spelled. The
shorter ones, quite frequently, were
misspelled.
The mental examination of Haupt
mann by six psychiatrists — three
representing New Jersey, two Bronx
County, and one the defense—was
renewed late today. Results of yes
terday's tests were not disclosed.
