COACHES MUST MEET
SPECIFICATIONS
The ideal football coach—
Must win games.
Must have a pleasing personality
And must have a popularity-gain
ing attitude.
But for the real ideal, all three
are essential, and the second and
third alone will do a good deal
in coaxing the officials to tolerate
a lack of the first.
At least from the standpoint ol
the hirers and firers of any univer
sity—a mixture of alumni, officials,
and students—the first is almost all
important.
The Pacific Coast this year has
several coaches who meet all three
requirements, some who fall down
on one or the other, and some who
fail in all three. The latter won't
last long.
VICTORIES HELP
BUT NOT NECESSARY
However, if the coach has a good
personality and attitude, many
losses will be tolerated often. Be
sides that, these two qualities are
much more important with the
sporting departments of various
newspapers, and these sports writ
ers do a lot in helping a coach keep
his job, or vice versa.
Not because he happens to rep
resent Stanford, but in considera
tion of the coach's prime requi
sites, Tiny Tho/hhill of the Card
inals apparently tomes as close
to being the idea! as does any
other mentor cf a major Pacific-
Coast school.
Tiny is not only popular on his
own campus, but alumni, non-par
tisans, and even anti-Stanford fans
look up to him as a teacher of foot
ball. Thornhill is plentifully sup
plied with the three above-men
tioned factors, from where this col
umn breaks into a pseudo-psycho
logical analysis.
Regarding victories, Thcrnhill was
particularly successful last year, his
first season of heading a major
coaching staff. His record of 1933
immediately placcd him as a fixture
at Stanford for a few years at least.
BUT TINY HAS
OTHER QUALITIES
Thornhill doubled the safety of his
position, however, by his person
ality. He is the "pal to all" type, is
consistently jovial, has a ready come
back, and yet is serious when that
is what is called for.
It is his attitude, however, that is
so different from that of many
coaches. When his team is beaten,
he tidies it, doesn't alibi, shift the
blame, or make any wild claims for
the futurei Before a game, he does
not go to the extreme of boasting
about his team, nor does he ap
proach the other extreme of gloomi
ness.
He gives the impression of be
ing confident of his team's abili
ties, without being cocky.
Another factor, one which gained
him as much popularity as any other
single incident since he received his
appointment, is his policy of not
holding secret work-outs, and his
campaign to get students out to
practice so they can meet the team.
Many coaches hold up their varsity
as things apart from the remainder
of the student body.
Possibly the coach most similar
to Thornhill in policy and attitude
is Babe Hollingberry of the Wash
ington State Cougars. HoHing
berry is noted for getting around
the campus, knowing "everybody,"
saying hello as if he meant it, and
generally being a good fellow. His
attitude in handling his team is
very much like that of Thornhill.
HOWARD JONES IS
QUIETER TYPE
Although he has the same confi
dent, non-cocky, non-alibiing atti
tude, the personality of Howard
Jones, U.S.C. headman, is much dif
ferent from that of either Thornhill
or Hollingberry. Jones is quiet, and
popular on his campus in a "strong, j
silent way." Even if he had no signs |
of personality, however, his record
of victories and his attitude would
establish him as a fixture.
Jones probably has more insight
and thorough knowledge of the
game than any coach on the Coast.
He is nationally famous as a teacher
of technicalities and fundamentals.
One of the cleverest coaches in
the game is Clipper Smith of
Santa Clara. He is (he excitable,
enthusiastic type, and probably

| will be with the Broncos for sev
eral years, particularly consider
ing that he has a sophomore team
which should establish his record
more firmly.
Smith's rival, Slip Madigan of the
tough St. Mary's Gaels, is more pop
ular on his own campus than any
where else. He is the typical Irish
man—full of fight, enthusiastic, and
a ready wit.
INGRAM MUST
COME THROUGH
This is the year for Navy Bill Tn
| gram across the bay. He has been
told, if not in so many words, that
I this is the season his team mvist
j come through. Although his record
has not been sensational, it lias
I been good enough so he would Le
excused, were it not that his atti
tude does not beget popularity even
on his own campus. He uses the
policy of secret practice, and ignores
the student body generally.
This fall, Ingram is making many
claims, most of which may be well
founded, but this attitude strikes
slightly of cockiness, which does
not gain popularity, particularly
if the number one demand—a win
ning team—is lacking.
Stanford has persistently saved
Jimmy Phelan's job with Washing
ton. His team has had hard luck in
the past few seasons, but has scraped
a major victory over Stan
ford in each case, which makes
Husky alumni a bit hesitant at
changing the staff. Fhelan has a
good reputation as a football teacher,
but he is notably unpopular with
his student body.
OREGON COACHES
ARE STILL NEW
The coaches at Oregon and Ore
gon State are still too new to have
established themselves one way or
the other, but last year both schools
came through with good records,
and few alterations are predicted in
the positions now held by Prince
Callison and Lon Stiner.
Bill Spaulding of U.C.L.A. has
been in the peculiar position of at
tempting to build a new school up
to compete with the best on the
Coast for the past five years. Con
sequently alumni tend to be a bit
lenient with him. He has been suc
cessful in this campaign, and now
competes with the best.
But in two or three years,
U.C.L.A. will be demanding (hat
he not only compete with, but (hat
he beat the major clubs. Spaulding
still has time to bring this about,
however.
As well liked as any in this vicin
ity is Spud Lewis, who is rapidly
developing his San Francisco Uni
versity Dons to a class where they
can play on even terms with the
best. —Browne.

This fall, Ingram is making many
claims, most of which may be well
founded, but this attitude strikes
slightly of cockiness, which does
not gain popularity, particularly
if the number one demand—a win
ning team—is lacking.
Stanford has persistently saved
Jimmy Phelan's job with Washing
ton. His team has had hard luck in
the past few seasons, but has scraped
a major victory over Stan
ford in each case, which makes
Husky alumni a bit hesitant at
changing the staff. Fhelan has a
good reputation as a football teacher,
but he is notably unpopular with
his student body.
OREGON COACHES
ARE STILL NEW
The coaches at Oregon and Ore
gon State are still too new to have
established themselves one way or
the other, but last year both schools
came through with good records,
and few alterations are predicted in
the positions now held by Prince
Callison and Lon Stiner.
Bill Spaulding of U.C.L.A. has
been in the peculiar position of at
tempting to build a new school up
to compete with the best on the
Coast for the past five years. Con
sequently alumni tend to be a bit
lenient with him. He has been suc
cessful in this campaign, and now
competes with the best.
But in two or three years,
U.C.L.A. will be demanding (hat
he not only compete with, but (hat
he beat the major clubs. Spaulding
still has time to bring this about,
however.
As well liked as any in this vicin
ity is Spud Lewis, who is rapidly
developing his San Francisco Uni
versity Dons to a class where they
can play on even terms with the
best. —Browne.
COACHES MUST MEET
SPECIFICATIONS
The ideal football coach—
Must win games.
Must have a pleasing personality
And must have a popularity-gain
ing attitude.
But for the real ideal, all three
are essential, and the second and
third alone will do a good deal
in coaxing the officials to tolerate
a lack of the first.
At least from the standpoint ol
the hirers and firers of any univer
sity—a mixture of alumni, officials,
and students—the first is almost all
important.
The Pacific Coast this year has
several coaches who meet all three
requirements, some who fall down
on one or the other, and some who
fail in all three. The latter won't
last long.
VICTORIES HELP
BUT NOT NECESSARY
However, if the coach has a good
personality and attitude, many
losses will be tolerated often. Be
sides that, these two qualities are
much more important with the
sporting departments of various
newspapers, and these sports writ
ers do a lot in helping a coach keep
his job, or vice versa.
Not because he happens to rep
resent Stanford, but in considera
tion of the coach's prime requi
sites, Tiny Tho/hhill of the Card
inals apparently tomes as close
to being the idea! as does any
other mentor cf a major Pacific-
Coast school.
Tiny is not only popular on his
own campus, but alumni, non-par
tisans, and even anti-Stanford fans
look up to him as a teacher of foot
ball. Thornhill is plentifully sup
plied with the three above-men
tioned factors, from where this col
umn breaks into a pseudo-psycho
logical analysis.
Regarding victories, Thcrnhill was
particularly successful last year, his
first season of heading a major
coaching staff. His record of 1933
immediately placcd him as a fixture
at Stanford for a few years at least.
BUT TINY HAS
OTHER QUALITIES
Thornhill doubled the safety of his
position, however, by his person
ality. He is the "pal to all" type, is
consistently jovial, has a ready come
back, and yet is serious when that
is what is called for.
It is his attitude, however, that is
so different from that of many
coaches. When his team is beaten,
he tidies it, doesn't alibi, shift the
blame, or make any wild claims for
the futurei Before a game, he does
not go to the extreme of boasting
about his team, nor does he ap
proach the other extreme of gloomi
ness.
He gives the impression of be
ing confident of his team's abili
ties, without being cocky.
Another factor, one which gained
him as much popularity as any other
single incident since he received his
appointment, is his policy of not
holding secret work-outs, and his
campaign to get students out to
practice so they can meet the team.
Many coaches hold up their varsity
as things apart from the remainder
of the student body.
Possibly the coach most similar
to Thornhill in policy and attitude
is Babe Hollingberry of the Wash
ington State Cougars. HoHing
berry is noted for getting around
the campus, knowing "everybody,"
saying hello as if he meant it, and
generally being a good fellow. His
attitude in handling his team is
very much like that of Thornhill.
HOWARD JONES IS
QUIETER TYPE
Although he has the same confi
dent, non-cocky, non-alibiing atti
tude, the personality of Howard
Jones, U.S.C. headman, is much dif
ferent from that of either Thornhill
or Hollingberry. Jones is quiet, and
popular on his campus in a "strong, j
silent way." Even if he had no signs |
of personality, however, his record
of victories and his attitude would
establish him as a fixture.
Jones probably has more insight
and thorough knowledge of the
game than any coach on the Coast.
He is nationally famous as a teacher
of technicalities and fundamentals.
One of the cleverest coaches in
the game is Clipper Smith of
Santa Clara. He is (he excitable,
enthusiastic type, and probably

| will be with the Broncos for sev
eral years, particularly consider
ing that he has a sophomore team
which should establish his record
more firmly.
Smith's rival, Slip Madigan of the
tough St. Mary's Gaels, is more pop
ular on his own campus than any
where else. He is the typical Irish
man—full of fight, enthusiastic, and
a ready wit.
INGRAM MUST

This is the year for Navy Bill Tn
| gram across the bay. He has been
told, if not in so many words, that
I this is the season his team mvist

practice so they can meet the team.
Many coaches hold up their varsity
as things apart from the remainder
of the student body.
Possibly the coach most similar
to Thornhill in policy and attitude
is Babe Hollingberry of the Wash
ington State Cougars. HoHing
berry is noted for getting around
the campus, knowing "everybody,"
saying hello as if he meant it, and
generally being a good fellow. His
attitude in handling his team is
very much like that of Thornhill.
HOWARD JONES IS
QUIETER TYPE
Although he has the same confi
dent, non-cocky, non-alibiing atti
tude, the personality of Howard
Jones, U.S.C. headman, is much dif
ferent from that of either Thornhill
or Hollingberry. Jones is quiet, and
popular on his campus in a "strong, j
silent way." Even if he had no signs |
of personality, however, his record
of victories and his attitude would
establish him as a fixture.
Jones probably has more insight
and thorough knowledge of the
game than any coach on the Coast.
He is nationally famous as a teacher
of technicalities and fundamentals.
One of the cleverest coaches in
the game is Clipper Smith of
Santa Clara. He is (he excitable,
enthusiastic type, and probably

| will be with the Broncos for sev
eral years, particularly consider
ing that he has a sophomore team
which should establish his record
more firmly.
Smith's rival, Slip Madigan of the
tough St. Mary's Gaels, is more pop
ular on his own campus than any
where else. He is the typical Irish
man—full of fight, enthusiastic, and
a ready wit.
INGRAM MUST
COME THROUGH
This is the year for Navy Bill Tn
| gram across the bay. He has been
told, if not in so many words, that
I this is the season his team mvist
j come through. Although his record
has not been sensational, it lias
I been good enough so he would Le
excused, were it not that his atti
tude does not beget popularity even
on his own campus. He uses the
policy of secret practice, and ignores
the student body generally.
This fall, Ingram is making many
claims, most of which may be well
founded, but this attitude strikes
slightly of cockiness, which does
not gain popularity, particularly
if the number one demand—a win
ning team—is lacking.
Stanford has persistently saved
Jimmy Phelan's job with Washing
ton. His team has had hard luck in
the past few seasons, but has scraped
a major victory over Stan
ford in each case, which makes
Husky alumni a bit hesitant at
changing the staff. Fhelan has a
good reputation as a football teacher,
but he is notably unpopular with
his student body.
OREGON COACHES
ARE STILL NEW
The coaches at Oregon and Ore
gon State are still too new to have
established themselves one way or
the other, but last year both schools
came through with good records,
and few alterations are predicted in
the positions now held by Prince
Callison and Lon Stiner.
Bill Spaulding of U.C.L.A. has
been in the peculiar position of at
tempting to build a new school up
to compete with the best on the
Coast for the past five years. Con
sequently alumni tend to be a bit
lenient with him. He has been suc
cessful in this campaign, and now
competes with the best.
But in two or three years,
U.C.L.A. will be demanding (hat
he not only compete with, but (hat
he beat the major clubs. Spaulding
still has time to bring this about,
however.
As well liked as any in this vicin
ity is Spud Lewis, who is rapidly
developing his San Francisco Uni
versity Dons to a class where they
can play on even terms with the
best. —Browne.
COACHES MUST MEET
SPECIFICATIONS
The ideal football coach—
Must win games.
Must have a pleasing personality
And must have a popularity-gain
ing attitude.
But for the real ideal, all three
are essential, and the second and
third alone will do a good deal
in coaxing the officials to tolerate
a lack of the first.
At least from the standpoint ol
the hirers and firers of any univer
sity—a mixture of alumni, officials,
and students—the first is almost all
important.
The Pacific Coast this year has
several coaches who meet all three
requirements, some who fall down
on one or the other, and some who
fail in all three. The latter won't
last long.
VICTORIES HELP
BUT NOT NECESSARY
However, if the coach has a good
personality and attitude, many
losses will be tolerated often. Be
sides that, these two qualities are
much more important with the
sporting departments of various
newspapers, and these sports writ
ers do a lot in helping a coach keep
his job, or vice versa.
Not because he happens to rep
resent Stanford, but in considera
tion of the coach's prime requi
sites, Tiny Tho/hhill of the Card
inals apparently tomes as close
to being the idea! as does any
other mentor cf a major Pacific-
Coast school.
Tiny is not only popular on his
own campus, but alumni, non-par
tisans, and even anti-Stanford fans
look up to him as a teacher of foot
ball. Thornhill is plentifully sup
plied with the three above-men
tioned factors, from where this col
umn breaks into a pseudo-psycho
logical analysis.
Regarding victories, Thcrnhill was
particularly successful last year, his
first season of heading a major
coaching staff. His record of 1933
immediately placcd him as a fixture
at Stanford for a few years at least.
BUT TINY HAS
OTHER QUALITIES
Thornhill doubled the safety of his
position, however, by his person
ality. He is the "pal to all" type, is
consistently jovial, has a ready come
back, and yet is serious when that
is what is called for.
It is his attitude, however, that is
so different from that of many
coaches. When his team is beaten,
he tidies it, doesn't alibi, shift the
blame, or make any wild claims for
the futurei Before a game, he does
not go to the extreme of boasting
about his team, nor does he ap
proach the other extreme of gloomi
ness.
He gives the impression of be
ing confident of his team's abili
ties, without being cocky.
Another factor, one which gained
him as much popularity as any other
single incident since he received his
appointment, is his policy of not
holding secret work-outs, and his
campaign to get students out to
practice so they can meet the team.

sporting departments of various
newspapers, and these sports writ
ers do a lot in helping a coach keep
his job, or vice versa.
Not because he happens to rep
resent Stanford, but in considera
tion of the coach's prime requi
sites, Tiny Tho/hhill of the Card
inals apparently tomes as close
to being the idea! as does any
other mentor cf a major Pacific-
Coast school.
Tiny is not only popular on his
own campus, but alumni, non-par
tisans, and even anti-Stanford fans
look up to him as a teacher of foot
ball. Thornhill is plentifully sup
plied with the three above-men
tioned factors, from where this col
umn breaks into a pseudo-psycho
logical analysis.
Regarding victories, Thcrnhill was
particularly successful last year, his
first season of heading a major
coaching staff. His record of 1933
immediately placcd him as a fixture
at Stanford for a few years at least.
BUT TINY HAS
OTHER QUALITIES
Thornhill doubled the safety of his
position, however, by his person
ality. He is the "pal to all" type, is
consistently jovial, has a ready come
back, and yet is serious when that
is what is called for.
It is his attitude, however, that is
so different from that of many
coaches. When his team is beaten,
he tidies it, doesn't alibi, shift the
blame, or make any wild claims for
the futurei Before a game, he does
not go to the extreme of boasting
about his team, nor does he ap
proach the other extreme of gloomi
ness.
He gives the impression of be
ing confident of his team's abili
ties, without being cocky.
Another factor, one which gained
him as much popularity as any other
single incident since he received his
appointment, is his policy of not
holding secret work-outs, and his
campaign to get students out to
practice so they can meet the team.
Many coaches hold up their varsity
as things apart from the remainder
of the student body.
Possibly the coach most similar
to Thornhill in policy and attitude
is Babe Hollingberry of the Wash
ington State Cougars. HoHing
berry is noted for getting around
the campus, knowing "everybody,"
saying hello as if he meant it, and
generally being a good fellow. His
attitude in handling his team is
very much like that of Thornhill.
HOWARD JONES IS
QUIETER TYPE
Although he has the same confi
dent, non-cocky, non-alibiing atti
tude, the personality of Howard
Jones, U.S.C. headman, is much dif
ferent from that of either Thornhill
or Hollingberry. Jones is quiet, and
popular on his campus in a "strong, j
silent way." Even if he had no signs |
of personality, however, his record
of victories and his attitude would
establish him as a fixture.
Jones probably has more insight
and thorough knowledge of the
game than any coach on the Coast.
He is nationally famous as a teacher
of technicalities and fundamentals.
One of the cleverest coaches in
the game is Clipper Smith of
Santa Clara. He is (he excitable,
enthusiastic type, and probably

| will be with the Broncos for sev
eral years, particularly consider
ing that he has a sophomore team
which should establish his record
more firmly.
Smith's rival, Slip Madigan of the
tough St. Mary's Gaels, is more pop
ular on his own campus than any
where else. He is the typical Irish
man—full of fight, enthusiastic, and
a ready wit.
INGRAM MUST
COME THROUGH
This is the year for Navy Bill Tn
| gram across the bay. He has been
told, if not in so many words, that
I this is the season his team mvist
j come through. Although his record
has not been sensational, it lias
I been good enough so he would Le
excused, were it not that his atti
tude does not beget popularity even
on his own campus. He uses the
policy of secret practice, and ignores
the student body generally.
This fall, Ingram is making many
claims, most of which may be well
founded, but this attitude strikes
slightly of cockiness, which does
not gain popularity, particularly
if the number one demand—a win
ning team—is lacking.
Stanford has persistently saved
Jimmy Phelan's job with Washing
ton. His team has had hard luck in
the past few seasons, but has scraped
a major victory over Stan
ford in each case, which makes
Husky alumni a bit hesitant at
changing the staff. Fhelan has a
good reputation as a football teacher,
but he is notably unpopular with
his student body.
OREGON COACHES
ARE STILL NEW
The coaches at Oregon and Ore
gon State are still too new to have
established themselves one way or
the other, but last year both schools
came through with good records,
and few alterations are predicted in
the positions now held by Prince
Callison and Lon Stiner.
Bill Spaulding of U.C.L.A. has
been in the peculiar position of at
tempting to build a new school up
to compete with the best on the
Coast for the past five years. Con
sequently alumni tend to be a bit
lenient with him. He has been suc
cessful in this campaign, and now
competes with the best.
But in two or three years,
U.C.L.A. will be demanding (hat
he not only compete with, but (hat
he beat the major clubs. Spaulding
still has time to bring this about,
however.
As well liked as any in this vicin
ity is Spud Lewis, who is rapidly
developing his San Francisco Uni
versity Dons to a class where they
can play on even terms with the
best. —Browne.
