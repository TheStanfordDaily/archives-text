# TRACK SIGN-UP PREDICTS STRONG FRESHMAN SQUAD
## 
### 
New material aplenty showed up
yesterday in the track sign-up and
equipment-issuing woi'kout. Frosh
with scrapbooks full of headline
clippings and fairly well-known
jaysee transfers serve to fill up the
ranks in every event.
Bill Ellington's frosh will have
three good jumpers. Leo Madlem,
at present a regular half-back, has
leaped 23 feet 7 inches, better than
any frosh has done for years, and a
point-scoring mark in any league.
Tom Collins, also a gridder, docs
22-7. In the high jump long Hank
Luisetti, erstwhile Galileo basket
bailer, won against the frosh last
year at G-2, and a year under Dink
Templeton can easily add several

FaSt Miler

Edson Burroughs from Tacoma
! has a mark of 4:29 in the mile, and
will be helped by Red Moore. Moore
will be forced to stick to light work
outs for the present, as he is not
yet fully recuperated from a sum
mer leg wound.
Two ace sprinters have signed up.
From Oakland comes Lars Skattebol,
for whom Ellington has fond hopes.
From Punaho school in Honolulu is
Jim Kneaubel. who does everything
from the sprints through the broad
jump up to the javelin. A 51.5 440
man is Jones.
New Disk Man
All-around athlete Beringer from
St. Helena looks like a worthy suc
cessor to the Hartranft;-Krenz-Grey-
Dunn cycle, with practice throws in
the discus measuring very close to
150 feet.
These are some of the frosh who
will ti'y to avenge last spring's down
fall at the hands of the Cal babes.

Ready for the varsity are Thorup,
from Taft, a 23-6 broad jumper, and
Rogers, from Ventura, a 12-6 pole
vaulter. Still, however, no /nan who
can clear 13 feet in Deacon's ab
sence has shown up, and fans shud
der to think of a twelve or fifteeri
point handicap to Cal and U.S.C. in
the two sprints.
Thorns to S.C.
Ray Dean and Warren Dixon,
sprinter and distance man, respec
tively, have planned to stay at San
Mateo J.C. for a semester, but in all
probability will be among those en
rolled at the farm for the winter
quarter.
Two strange transfers took place
over the summer. Carl Thorns, var
sity sprinter from last year, has gone
to U.S.C. Milt Haller, 6-2 jumper
of the '37 Cal frosh, registered here.
He has two years of competition.
Hazing and Hell Week activities
of all organizations on the campus
have been banned by the faculty
welfare committee at the University
of Southern California.
