# Frosh Eleven Meets Menlo J. C. Team
## Season Opener Gives Babies Chance To Fulfill Boasts; Jaysees Outweigh Yearlings, Have Good Ends 
### 
Coach Jimmy Bradshaw's 1931 frosh eleven will take over the loeal
football stage tomorrow afternoon for their season's opener, with Menlo
Junior College at 2:30 o'clock in the Stadium.
For the frosh the game will mean a chance to live up to enthusiastic
pre-season expectations, an opportunity to start fulfilling the belief held
by many of the local fans that the 1934 frosh squad equals the famous 1932

forces which played an unbeaten'
season and then sent such men as
Bobby Grayson, Bob Hamilton, Jim
Moscrip, and Bob Reynolds to the
varsity.
Menlo will enter the game hop
ing to redeem the loss of last Sat
urday's contest with Chico State
Teachers College, their first of the
season, and to prove to their Penin
sula followei's that they have a team
which will stand up with any other
junior college in the state.
Sweet Likes Team
As a matter of fact Coach Russ
Sweet has already claimed that his
1934 team is the best in three years.
Regardless of playing abilities, the
Oaks are certain to lack nothing from
the standpoint of size. This size
factor may be the deciding one in
tomorrow's game, for frosh linemen
are not often used to handling men
of much greater size, and Bradshaw
may see his reverses and spinners
piling up at the lino of scrimmage.
If there is a standout in the Menlo
line it will probably be Jim Sadler,
co-captain and end who played a
strong game in defeat against Chico.
The frosh reverses depend on the
success of the guard and quarter
back in knocking the opposing end
out of the play, so Sadler and Fred
Hansen, the other end, will be key
men for the frosh interference to
handle.
Beefy Line
Judging by the Chico contest, oth
er leaders of the Menlo forward
wall are Verne Johnson, guard, Niel
Rasmussen and A1 Kcyes, tackles.
All are heavy men, giving the line
an average weight of 188 pounds
per.
The backfield, which averages but
eight pounds less per man in size,
has two hard-driving ball packers
in Wally Goodnow and Harris You
dal, half and full respectively. Verne
Johnson runs from the quarterback
position while the remaining mem
ber is Jack Brigham.
The Stanford frosh are up against
the usual handicap of being enthu
siastically boosted even before they
have been given a chance in real
action. Their prep reputations have
come with them, with the fans' ex
pectations further adding to the rep
utations of the yearling stars.
Collins on Defense
At any rate there will be certain
men who will be watched with more
than usual care. First are three
backs, headed by Tom Collins, a
Portland boy following in the foot
steps of Bobby Grayson. Collins
tackles clean and hard and will have

1 an opportunity to show his offensive
drive on the reverses.
His teammate at the other half
I position will be Bill Paulman of
Oxnard. Paulman is rated as an
unusual frosh punter and is also
expected to do the passing. Doc
Luckett comes to the Farm with
Texas all-state honors and should
have a chance to display his prowess
from the safety post.
Henningson Rugged
Irving Henningson hails from Hay
i ward, and is plenty husky enough
; to hold his own with any lineman
1 Menlo can put on the held. Hen
ningson seems to like the rough
going and his tackle job should be
well taken care of.
Another lineman 'who will bear
watching is Bob Dakan, an all-San
Franfisco end. Dakan is much like
Henningson in makeup and plays a
j slashing game. Those who have
watched the great success of Bones,
Hamilton and Jim Moscrip in Stan
ford football will be interested in
, the performance of another man who
received his initial training at Kiski
prep in Pennsylvania, Jay Holdridge,
I guard.
The complete but tentative frosh
line-up follows: Dakan and Ber
neth Layex - , ends; Henningson and
Cye Oberg, tackles; Holdridge and
John Partridge, guards; Nelly Heath,
center; Luckett, Paulman, Ed Gil
lette, and Leo Madlem or Collins, '
\ backs.
