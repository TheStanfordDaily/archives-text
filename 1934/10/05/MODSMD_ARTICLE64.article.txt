# FROSH SQUAD LACKS SOCCER EXPERIENCE
## 
### 
The moulding of a good present
able eleven from this year's frosh
soccer material is going to be a real
man-sized task, John Moore, newly
appointed freshman coach, fears.
Singling his men out from the
varsity as they scrimmaged together
yesterday afternoon, the star of last
year's varsity saw that most of the
men had much to learn. With a few
exceptions they are green, some
having never played soccer befoi'e.
But Moore, undaunted, optimisti
cally pointed to Sloane, a center
forward who apparently has had
several years' experience in prep
school; to Everett, who is a fast
inside forward who learned the
game in China; and De√üendetti, an
other inside forward who comes from
the land of Navarro and Gomez of
varsity fame.
