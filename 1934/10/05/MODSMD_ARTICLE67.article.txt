# Soccermen In Practice Game With S.J. State
## Captain Waddy White Stars In Halfback Line 
### 
The mettle of 1934 Indian soccer
will get its first test tomorrow.
With a team composed almost en
tirely of men having little experi
ence, Coach Harry Moloney's squad
will take the field against San Jose
State in a pre-session practice game
tomorrow morning at 10 o'clock.
The game is primarily a condition
medium, Maloney says. A tenta
tive first string will be started but
an attempt will be made to piit
every member of the squad in at
some time during the game. If offi
cial practice game rules are fol
lowed the score will not even be kept
but it is indicated that a few such
details will be overlooked.
Meet San Jose Later
Besides giving the squad a chance
to condition itself in actual compe
tition, the game will enable ths men
to get their bearings against San
Jose, who will be opponents in a
regular conference battle on Octo
ber 27.
Coach Walker of San Jose is send
ing down a team which is almost as
weak from the point of experience
as Stanford. Donahoo, last year all
conference man, is the spark- plug
of the outfit at outside right. Hig
gins and Breacher, inside forwards,
and Rhines, fullback, are among
those who played against Stanford
last season.
Names Starters
The team which Maloney will field
tomorrow is composed of: McClel
land, goal; Peck, right back; Vier
ling, left back; Gonzales, right half;
Walker, center half; White, left half;
Dibble, outside right; Row, inside
right; Navarro, center forward;
Gomez, inside left; Rigby, outside
left.
This squad, which showed up well
in scrimmages Wednesday and last
night, has a number of veterans nnd
some new players who show con
siderable promise.
Captain White in the halfback line
is perhaps the most active player on
the field, being exceptionally strong
both on defense and offense. Walker,
center half, is a small man but is a
hard kicker. On the forward line
from where the scores emanate is the
veteran Spaniard who learned his
soccer in the Argentine, Navarro.
Gomez, a fellow countryman at. in
side left, packs a terrific boot and is
exceptional on the dribble.
Peck and Vierling will present a
good pair at right and left back.
Both are fast men and long kick
ers. McClelland and Row are both
players coming up from last year's
frosh eleven.
One of the things most pleasing
to Maloney about this year's team is
its size. At no time does he expect
to be pressed for reserve players.
At present there are four full squads
in the varsity group.

players coming up from last year's
frosh eleven.
One of the things most pleasing
to Maloney about this year's team is
its size. At no time does he expect
to be pressed for reserve players.
At present there are four full squads
in the varsity group.
The mettle of 1934 Indian soccer
will get its first test tomorrow.
With a team composed almost en
tirely of men having little experi
ence, Coach Harry Moloney's squad
will take the field against San Jose
State in a pre-session practice game
tomorrow morning at 10 o'clock.
The game is primarily a condition
medium, Maloney says. A tenta
tive first string will be started but
an attempt will be made to piit
every member of the squad in at
some time during the game. If offi
cial practice game rules are fol
lowed the score will not even be kept
but it is indicated that a few such
details will be overlooked.
Meet San Jose Later
Besides giving the squad a chance
to condition itself in actual compe
tition, the game will enable ths men
to get their bearings against San
Jose, who will be opponents in a
regular conference battle on Octo
ber 27.
Coach Walker of San Jose is send
ing down a team which is almost as
weak from the point of experience
as Stanford. Donahoo, last year all
conference man, is the spark- plug
of the outfit at outside right. Hig
gins and Breacher, inside forwards,
and Rhines, fullback, are among
those who played against Stanford
last season.
Names Starters
The team which Maloney will field
tomorrow is composed of: McClel
land, goal; Peck, right back; Vier
ling, left back; Gonzales, right half;
Walker, center half; White, left half;
Dibble, outside right; Row, inside
right; Navarro, center forward;
Gomez, inside left; Rigby, outside
left.
This squad, which showed up well
in scrimmages Wednesday and last
night, has a number of veterans nnd
some new players who show con
siderable promise.
Captain White in the halfback line
is perhaps the most active player on
the field, being exceptionally strong
both on defense and offense. Walker,
center half, is a small man but is a
hard kicker. On the forward line
from where the scores emanate is the
veteran Spaniard who learned his
soccer in the Argentine, Navarro.
Gomez, a fellow countryman at. in
side left, packs a terrific boot and is
exceptional on the dribble.
Peck and Vierling will present a
good pair at right and left back.
Both are fast men and long kick
ers. McClelland and Row are both
players coming up from last year's
frosh eleven.
