"A very, very limited number of
Chaparrals will be on Quad sale
next Thursday," whispered Old Boy
Gordy Steedman, the phantom hand
on the throttle. "And ALL first
editions."
This crack sent the Venerable
Cuckoo running for cover. Reaching
underneath the old rocking chair
which had just got him, he brought
it out. "A Rembrandt?" asked the
little girl in the back of the spa
cious room. "Yeh, but we left it
out in the van Ryn."
"It is colossal," the little girl said.
"No, it is not. It is a photolith," said
Editor Steedman, his tongue show
ing a sharp lith to starboard. "You've
heard of monoliths and batholiths?
Well, this isn't like 'em. It is the
new system Chaparral has of print
ing the cover. It shows up the
"Traveling Salesman" more beauti
fully than ever.

First College Comic in the West,
Chappie is now the first in the coun
try to present a cover printed by the

Everett Claiborne, spiking English
and doing quite well (something

, tryoutees and girls with sales appeal
jto report for a business meeting
j Tuesday evening at 7:30 o'clock,
when he will speak English again.
The Venerable Cuckoo will not

and pencil whips, but requests all
' embryo artists and writers to drop
j in for a spot of tea and crumpets,
but only a spot.
Embryo subscribers are requested
to drop into the business office and

i horse of a different caller," says
Mr. Steedman.
