# MEXICAN DRAMATIC DIRECTOR PRAISES U. S. STAGE IN HELVENSTON INTERVIEW
## 
### 
Distinctly different from the usual !
dry, colorless radio interview was
that of Harold Helvenston, Stanford
dramatic director, and Professor Ro
dolfo Usigli, of the University of
Mexico. The questions and answers
seemed almost spontaneous as they
came over the air via KFRC yester
day at 4:30 o'clock.
Now on sabbatical leave, Helven
ston has associated himself with the
San Francisco station as dramatic
director. Usigli is on a special mis
sion to view theaters in this country
for the Mexican Ministry of Educa
tion. Both men are authors of books I
on contemporary theatrics in their
own countries.
Near the interview's end, Helven
ston, rather than the interrogator,
was the target for questions as the
Mexican sought to learn of the
American theater. The Stanford ,
professor named as the strong point j
of this country's dramatics its stage j
technology. So advanced are the,
backstage experts here that an au- !
thor need hesitate at no theatrical i
illusion as being too difficult. The 1
technicians can handle them, Hel
venston claims.
After explaining to the visitor that '

American drama portrays many dif
ferent phases and sections in na
tional life, Helvenston was asked to
name the "most typically American
type of play." Up to the minute was
Stanford's drama head; no old-fog
eyism for his; not "Uncle Tom's
Cabin," or some other "immortal"
epic.
Musical satire is the height of
originality among playwrights of the
stars and stripes. As examples, Hel
venston named "Of Thee I Sing,"
"Let 'em Eat Cake," and "Life Be
gins at Eighty-Forty." Usigli laugh
ingly remarked that he "looked for
ward to seeing them."
For his part, the noted Mexican
told of the rise of the drama in his
country. The struggle was hard, he
said, as the country is a hard-work -
ing one and had to be persuaded that
it had time for such things. He
spoke of early efforts and how crude
and vulgar their action had to be.
Modernization and national style
are now coming, however.
When Helvenston produced an
English drama for the Anglo-Amer
ican colony in Mexico City last year
he met and worked with Usigli, who,
like himself, is an author, professor,
and radio director.
