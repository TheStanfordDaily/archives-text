"The Bolshevik Revolution" by
James Bunyan and H. H. Fisher,
latest publication of the Stanford
University Press, is the third book
to be based on the authentic docu
ments and materials of the Hoover
War Library.
Through decrees, manifestos, pub
lic documents, and the reports of ob
servers and the contemporary press,
the authors reveal how the Bolshe
viks seized the power of Russia in
1917 and kept it during the first six
months of their rule. The last days
of the Provisional government, the
struggles of the Bolsheviks and the
Socialists, and Soviet relations with
the allies are among the topics dis
cussed.
The editors "have tried to make
selections which show the condi
tions of the time, how the various
parties-and leaders viewed them, the
action that was taken, and the re
sults as they appeared at the time,"
according to the preface.
This is one of a series of volumes
relating to the Russian revolution
being prepared under the direction
of Fisher, who is associate professor
of history at Stanford, from the great
Russian collection in the Hoover War
Library. It is priced at six dollars.
