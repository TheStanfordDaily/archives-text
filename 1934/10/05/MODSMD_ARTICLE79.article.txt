# SERA EMPLOYMENT HEAD OFFERS NEW MEN FINANCIAL AID
## 
### 
Owing to the lact that Mrs. Irene
Spennex% Stanford's student employ
ment director, desires to give the
most needy persons the jobs allotted
under the SERA, release cards will
not be distributed until next week.
This was made known when it was
revealed that several jobs were still
open to those classified under "new
students," or those who were finan
cially unable to attend any college
this past year. Freshmen and stu
dents not enrolled in any college last
spring are thus eligible for the re
maining jobs as yet open.
Stanford's quota was 400 students,
Mrs. Spenner explained, of which
half is to be "old students," or those
who attended any college since Jan
uary, and the other 200 were the
"new students" for which jobs wore
still left. The "old students" quota
is already filled. J.C. transfers are
considered "old students," as the
government classifies junior colleges
as colleges.
Emphasis is stressed on financial
need for procuring these jobs, and
Mrs. Spenner expressed her appre
ciation for the manner in which stu
dents, both men and women, told of
their conditions, and in the way they
refused SERA jobs when other jobs
were had or available.
Although appointments arc neces
sary to see Mrs. Spenner, release
cards may be had by asking the
telephone operator at the registrar's
office without appointment.
