# WRENN TO GIVE READING TESTS
## 
### 
Dr. C. Gilbert Wrenn is giving the
famous reading tests, whereby stu
dents are able to read more rapidly
and improve their grades, to trans
fers this quarter, a privilege for
merly given only to freshmen.
Saturday morning at 9 o'clock in
Room 231 all upper division trans
-1 fers and about 50 freshmen who
I missed the last examination are in
vited to Lake this one.
This is to test the student's habits
in silent reading. W. M. Danner, re
; search assistant in psychology, and
Dr. Albert Walton assisted Dr.
Wrenn in working this device down
to a fine point here at Stanford. The
plan includes a delicate system of
â€¢ photographing eye movements and
I correcting errors. This mechanical
| equipment is additional to rules ad
vocated by Dr. Wrenn and Mr.
Danner.
Dr. Wrenn believes the eye sees
i only when it pauses, not when in
motion. Therefore, if the reader takes
too many pauses in a sentence, he is
wasting time, according to scien
' tists. Among ways of overcoming
j this is the use of a mechanical pacer,
: an electrical device somewhat com
i parable to a metronome, used by
; students of music.
