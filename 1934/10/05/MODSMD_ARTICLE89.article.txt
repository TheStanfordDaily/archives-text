# U.S.C. FRATERNITY HELL WEEK BANNED
## 
### 
I Because of "undesirable practices
connected with fraternity hell
: weeks," President Rufus von Klein-
Smid of the University of Southern
California has banned hell weeks at
that college.
Sentiment in fraternity circles
1 appeared to be almost solidly against
| the edict, which prohibits tubbing,
paddling, exposure, rough handling,
and deprivation of sleep below a
daily minimum of seven hours.
A member of the Int.erfraternity
Council declared, '"I think that the
rule banning hazing of any sort will
do away with the spirit of the fra
ternity and defeat its purpose."
Explaining his sudden action, Dr.
von Klein-Smid stated, "For several
years past, the university authorities
have repeatedly appealed to the In
terfraternity Council and the indi
vidual fraternities, requesting them
to take definite and positive action
leading to the elimination of unde
sirable practices connected with fra
ternity hell weeks."
Declaring that the requests had
been ignored except in a few iso
lated instances, Dr. von KleinSmid
said the present regulation was de
signed "to protect the majority of
fraternity men from the thoughtless
minority."
