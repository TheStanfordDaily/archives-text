# AUTHORS WRITE ON LIBRARY USE
## 
### 
Sinclair Lewis does not use pub
lic libraries because he can't smoke
in them. John Dos Passos does most
of his research work in old news
papers that he finds in libraries.
Thornton Wilder has "neither the
industry nor the perseverance for
research"â€”he guesses at details of
historical and local nature. Sher
wood Anderson is more interested
in studying human beings than in
library research.
All this was discovered by Leonard
Kirkpatrick, Stanford Library em
ployee, when he wrote letters to
several prominent American authors
and asked them '"How do you use a
library in your research?"
If more libraries followed the lead
of the Dartmouth Library, and in
cluded smoking and music rooms,
Sinclair would no longer have to
buy the books which he has to read.
According to Kirkpatrick, the latest
books on library planning advise the
inclusion of .such rooms, with com
fortable chairs, and plenty of ash
trays.
Letters from the four authors who
answered the questionable are on
exhibition in one of the cases at the
top of the stairs in the Main Library.
