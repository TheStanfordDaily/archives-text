# LEADS CHOSEN FOR QUARTER'S INITIAL DRAMA
## Timmons Selects Cast At End of Third Tryout; Experience Ignored 
### 
Harriette Hall Kilby, Kay Ar
thur, Allan O'Neil and Paul Crary
will take the leads in "One Sunday
Afternoon," the play by James
Hagan which William Murray Tim
mons will present November 2.
Mr. Timmons, the present dra
matics director, did not base his
selections last Friday evening on any
previous experience of the troyout
ees. As a result, the cast which was
finally selected at the end of the
third tryout is composed of both
seasoned and new players on the
Stanford stage. The speedy selec
tion of the cast is itself surprising, as
well as the combination of names
which result.

Grimes; Allen O'Neil, Hugo Barn
stead; Kay Arthur, Virginia Brush;
Mrs. Kilby, Amy Lind; Phil Brown,

Playbooks will be available for all
members of the cast after 1 o'clock
this afternoon in the Dramatic Man
ager's office in the Old Union.
"One Sunday Afternoon" is a
comedy of reminiscence, comparing
the enduring virtues of the good old
days with the superficial glamour of
the present, and promises to be good
material for Mr. Timmons' first Stan
ford play.
