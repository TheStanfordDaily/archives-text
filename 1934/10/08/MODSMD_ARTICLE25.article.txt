# Ticket Sale Extended on Wildcat Tilt
## 700 Rooter's Seats Still Available 
### 
Officials at the B.A.C. office have
decided to keep their ticket booths
open today from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.,
with rooters' tickets selling at $1.10.
Students are also privileged to pur
chase as many regular tickets, priced
at $2.20, as they wish.
According to figures released Sat
urday by Don Liebendorfer, B.A.C.
publicity director, the sale of tickets
for the Northwestern game rooting
section fell far below the number
planned for next Saturday's game.
Space for 2300
The Rally committee plans to have
a rooting section of approximately
2300, there being ample space for
1700 men and 600 women.
Out of 1000 student tickets sold by
last Saturday, 400 were purchased
by campus women,* the remaining
fiOO going to men. Indications point
to the interest of the Rough turning
elsewhere, while that of the Stanford
woman becomes increasingly in
clined toward football.
Game Important
Aside from the Pittsburgh-U.S.C.
battle in Pittsburgh next Saturday
afternoon, which does not loom so
important since the Trojans' defeat
at the hands of Washington State,
the Northwestern - Stanford tussle
seems the most important inter-sec
tional contest on next week's na
tional schedule.
Rally committee heads stated last
night that student body cards would
not be sufficient for admission. It
was emphasized, however, that root
ers' tickets, priced at $1.10 will be
necessary for entrance.
