the far end of the row at 7:30 Thurs

sporting fiery torches, and probably
headed by the campus fire engine.
Gathering forces and momentum
as it marches up the row and past
dormitories, the parade will storm
the pavilion about 8 o'clock.

There Dick Hanley, who coaches
the Northwestern football squad, wiil
be led before the throng, if the rally 1
committee can obtain him. Yell'
Lader Jim Triolo will rouse rooters
to song and yells.
