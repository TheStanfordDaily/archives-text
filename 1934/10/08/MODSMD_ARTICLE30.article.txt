# O.S. C. Win Gives Cards Edge for Saturday Game
## Stanford Comes Back After Santa Clara Tie, Licks Oregon State 17-0 INDIAN ENDS STAR Northwestern Fails to Score In 20-0 Loss to Iowa 
### 
While other Coast favorites were
being toppled by supposedly second
rate teams, the Stanford varsity did
the expected wilh a flourish and
trimmed Oregon State College Sat
urday at Portland hy a 17-0 score.
This decisive win over what was
regarded by pre-season experts as
one of (he strong teams of the
Coast and as a follow-up to a
rather dubious opener with Santa
Clara, slum Id give Stanford at
least 2-1 odds over Northwestern
(his coming Saturday.
While the Cards were thus estab
lishing themselves as one of the
teams to beat, Northwestern's stock
dropped a few points more when
the Wildcats were decisively defeated
by lowa, 20-0.
For the Cards the win came as a
redemption for their last trip north,
last season when Washington marred
an otherwise undefeated season by
upsetting them 6-0. But this time
all the bugaboos of northern trips
we re wanting. The field was dry and
firm—ideal for the Indian reverses
and off-tackle plays. The weather
was too warm for the Oregon State
hoys, used to cloudy skies, but not
hot enough to bother the Palo Alto
boys, not after the Santa Clara game
roasting.
The victory was a cherished one
for the Cards in another way. Bobby
Grayson, Stanford fullback star, had
gone back to his home town, Port
land, to be warmly greeted by a
"Bobby Grayson Day." So the cele
bration had a meaning when Gray
son and his team won the ball game.
Grayson Shines
The home town fans might well
have been proud of Grayson's dis
play of football prowess, but the
Grayson star shone brightest in
smart signal calling and sacrifice
rather than as a bruising line crash
er. Instead of giving the ball to him
self for the plunge from the Btjaver
four-yard line late in the third
quarter, a touchdown that would
have meant much to Grayson—one
for the home folks—Bobby called
for Bones Hamilton to smash left
tackle. The Oregon line-men, .set
for Grayson, were outsmarted when
Hamilton drove over for the score.
Card followers were happy over
the 17-point win and Stanford's 2J i
yards from scrimmage against Ore
gon State's 55 for still another rea
son. The long discussed and anti
cipated comparison of the two most
famed halfbacks on the Coast, Gray
son and Red Franklin of Oregon,
took place Saturday, and the result
was entirely in Grayson's favor.
While Grayson was making a total
of 50 yards from scrimmage Frank
lin actually finished with a negative
gain, minus 29 yards.
But in justice to Franklin it must
be said that it was the superb end
work of the Stanford flank-men,
Monk Moscrip and Keith Topping,
that caused the negative yardage,
rather than the ineffectiveness of
Franklin's running. Moscrip and
Topping never did allow Franklin in
break into the open field, which is
precisely where Franklin shines.
"Iron Eleven" Cracks
The cracking of their nationally
famed "iron eleven" made it a sorry
day for the Corvallis school. For
two quarters the Beavers lived up
to their reputation and turned back
the Stanford drives. The result of I
the first three penetrations deep into |
Oregon State territory was exactly
3 points, due to a field goal from the
toe of Monk Moscrip and not Stan
ford punch.
But in the third quarter the Cards I
look on a zip and the Beavers visibly |
tired under the poundings of the |
Stanford backs. Furthermore, in ihe
third period Stanford made a vital
change in her tactics, decided that it
could not pierce the center of a line.
which contained such men as Clyde
Devine and Bill Tomsheck and began j
using off-tackle smashes. From then j

Hamilton Scores
After an unsuccessful attempt at a '
field goal by Moscrip and an ex- ,
change of punts, Stanford took the j
ball on the Oregon State 40-yard
line. Grayson made 3 and Van Del
len 12. Hamilton cracked right tackle <
for 4 and Alustiza smashed the other j
side for 11 more. An opening at
center allowed Hamilton to add 7.
Grayson picked up 4, then crossed ;
up the expectant Oregon State line
men and sent Hamilton over tackle j
for the score. Moscrip converted.
In the fourth quarter the Stanford
punch showed up even more bril- ;
liantly as a substitute backfield, |
Rusty Ledbetter, Gordon Head, Stan
Anderson, and Van Dellen, made 55 \
yards and a touchdown on four plays.
They started on the Oregon State 45-
yard line with the recovery of Wood- '
man's fumble. Ledbetter was good;
for 4 and Head for 14. Then Van
Dellen made the longest run of the
day, slicing off tackle, then sidestep
ping tacklers and ramming over
others until downed on the 4-yard
line. Sophomore Ledbetter went over 1
standing up on the next play and
Moscrip converted.
Stanford's offensive play ended I

then, late in the fourth quarter, but
the small (12,000) but enthusiastic
crowd still had a thrill in store when
Oregon State came within an ace of
scoring. Finding themselves deep in
their own territory, the score against
them, and but a few minutes left to
play, the Beavers called for a prayer
pass. It clicked as Daneri, substitute
for Franklin, tossed a long one to
Casserly, end, that took Oregon from
their own 34-yard line to Stanford's
16. Daneri drove through the Stan
lord line on a series of bucks that put
the ball on the Card two-yard line.
Then—the gun.
