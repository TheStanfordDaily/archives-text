California journalists and readers of news
jdaee eagle eyes upon llie Stale Supreme Court
since that august body has eiled the publishers
of a San Francisco newspaper for contempt
of court, based upon an "inside story" of
recent date predicling.a forthcoming decision.
Although important in the consideration
of principle and the future hindrance of
justice because of any form of "trial by news
paper," the outcome of the case against the
San Francisco paper is of little import along
side the more vital consideration of that same
verdict, which has never been announced, and
upon which hangs the life of a human being.
The judges are admittedly in a very un
fortunate and embarrassing position. If the
reported decision is aflinned by the court,
there will be those who will shout that the
San Francisco paper has forced the hand of
the group and thereby in elYeel made neces
sary, (or expedient) tlie result.
Iftit if the actual decision should be a coin
lete reversal of the predicted outcome, de
manding the life of the individual in the
balance, the public will even more emphati
cally cry that an injustice has been done and
that the verdict might have been done to spite
llie press.
It will take a courageous group of judges
to act either way, and the ease must be settled
at once. The incident has already withheld
llie progress of justice much too long. There
is no reason to place any human in the position
of a pa'wn to other human emotions swayed
bv irrelevant circumstances.
