The Fniversity of California was celebrat
ing last Saturday night from ils spacious new
gvmnasium, decorated in the "night club"
mot if.
Fourteen hundred seniors danced to the
harmonizing tunes of a well-known orchestra.
And marvel of marvels, the program was
broadcast over a large radio station direct
from the campus itself.
(lame the introduction of Walter Christie
Jr., son of the beloved Christie known to
Ihrce generations of CaiifornTans, and present
editor of the Daily ('alifornittn. Christie s;iid:
"Despite what happened to us this afternoon,
I expect that we will meet on January Ist of
next year down in Pasadena." In addition to
this startling piece of intelligence, Christie
seemed well acquainted with the types of
gowns being worn at the dance, using such
lenns ;ss "cocktail," "tea dance," "afternoon"
and "evening" in vivid description of the
gala festivities.
It seems too had that with young Christie's
information on the latter subject, he did not
lake the trouble to tind out that there are
other Conference schools who also have that
same desire to meet in Pasadena, Hose Bowl
day.
Anyway, he evidently doesn't believe in the
fiction of so-called "false modestv."
