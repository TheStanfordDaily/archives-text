## SMILING PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT 
### BOB JONES 
First man of note in Washington on my list was
Franklin D. Roosevelt.
"Impossible" was the answer to my pleas to influon
i tial men to see the President. Congress was just break
! ing up, and the "head man" had his hands full trying
| to send his "boys" in Congress home.
Three secretaries and a few guards formed a rather
impenetrable barrier to inquisitive persons, trying "to
bust in" to meet the Chief. 1 went into a huddle with u
leading Washington correspondent of one of the New
I York papers to plan my offensive. He said that what I
asked had not been done before to his knowledge.
He rang up the White House and persuaded Sieve
I Early, press secretary, that I was an active newsman
(on the Stanford Daily). I was told to appear at the
I Executive wing of the White House at 4 o'clock for
the regular Friday afternoon press conference. Big
news from "Mr. President" was expected.
Long before the appointed time I was in the big,
j white-walled, officered reception room in the west wing.
1 Some of the "boys" of the press were in two lines out
• side the Executive office. My correspondent friend and
I fell in with the others.
At the signal from Steve Early the "boys" whooped
| into the sacred chamber where many famed Presidents
I had directed the affairs of the nation. There was a rush
1 for a position at the front of the President's huge ma
hogany desks. Using tactics learned when trying to
get good seats at a football or basketball game, I found
myself standing directly in front of the Chief Executive.
Roosevelt was seated in his big, impressive chair.
Behind him stretched windows that looked out on the
rolling green lawns back of the White House. Seated
on the window ledge on both sides of the President
were two men, evidently in the secret service, dressed
in plain business clothes. Steve Early stood on the
i Chief's left to lead the discussion. Exactly as I had
: seen in the movies and on the front pages, the President
j was all smiles. That much-talked-of, bubbling per
| sonality placed the correspondents perfectly at ease.
"Mr. President" was most impressive looking
as he sat in the coveted chair from which he did not
; rise once during the entire time I was in the room.
' He was large but not fat. His big frame was typical
' of that of some football player. He looked tired.
His eyes twitched nervously behind his glasses.
When the scribes settled down, Roosevelt greeted
' them informally. Before this, he had commented on a
i couple of the "boys' " white linen suits. Then he spoke
out. He disappointed the gathering by saying Ihat
there was "nothing new." The correspondents had
| hoped for words about the Japanese situation, the San
i Francisco longshoremen's strike, and the drought.
Correspondents might have disagreed with Roose
velt's theories or actions, but that feeling of opposition
dissolved before that smile and that magnetic, friendly
J personality. That winning smile would wear away the
I most fortified and entrenched resistance.
I Since no officially prepared comment was forthcom
! ing, one of the correspondents asked informally about
j a luncheon the President had with some Japanese dig
l nitary. With a smile—always that smile—Roosevelt ic
plied that no definite State affairs had been settled at
the informal luncheon. "We just ate," he summarized.
Question after question was popped at the Chief
Executive—about the NRA, drought damage, reforesta
| tion, and labor troubles. The President casually said
what he knew. If he didn't know the answer, he would
| reply, in an offhand manner, "I don't know," smile, and
! refer the person to some department secretary. He
! might say, "Ask Miss Perkins. She might know."
Always there was that smile. I could see that "Mr.
| President" had gained the confidence of the Washing
ton correspondents. He was their trusted friend. Never
| before had a President treated members of the Press
lin such a friendly, informal way. Before the Roosevelt
regime, correspondents were forced to turn in all ques
tions, written, to the press secretary before the con
ferences. The President then chose questions which
he wanted to answer and disregarded the others. With
J Roosevelt, the "boys" were privileged to ask, orally,
j any question. Some kind of answer was always forth
■ coming.
Informality was the keynote of the conference. One
if the correspondents kidded the President about the
golf game that his secretary, Steve Early, played.
When a statement was made that was not to be
| quoted, the President would label that statement as
i 'off the record." The correspondents understood.
As for keeping in touch with the happenings in the
nation, Roosevelt was in the habit of looking over the
New York, Philadelphia, and Washington papers every
morning, besides religiously reading what Walter Lipp
man had to say about him and his "New Deal."
I On the wide expanse of the desk top stood the
symbol of the ranking party of the moment, a black
donkey, with a white elephant alongside. The usual
desk articles were also present—papers, books, a lamp,
! and blotter.
The conference broke up after about a twenty
i minute session. Several of the "boys" lingered to pop
"after-time"' questions. Tbe other correspondents filed
1 out, wishing that the President had given more concrete
information so that they might have had that hoped-for
i big news to wire the home office.
Yet, to mc, the President was most satisfying. He
ranked at the top with the most likeable persons i
have ever met. He was a most polished politician,
just about in a class by himself.
One of the President's secretaries told me to look
| around the White House. I ambled into the cabinet
I meeting room with its long oblong table. Then I took
a squint at (he new, blue swimming pool, built cx
| pressly for Roosevelt for the only exercise he receives.
A typically sultry Washington day made it most
| alluring.
Tomorrow another Democrat chieftain, A! Smith, the
I "unhappy warrior," will be introduced.

out. He disappointed the gathering by saying Ihat

dissolved before that smile and that magnetic, friendly

I Since no officially prepared comment was forthcom

j a luncheon the President had with some Japanese dig
l nitary. With a smile—always that smile—Roosevelt ic
plied that no definite State affairs had been settled at
the informal luncheon. "We just ate," he summarized.
Question after question was popped at the Chief
Executive—about the NRA, drought damage, reforesta
| tion, and labor troubles. The President casually said
what he knew. If he didn't know the answer, he would
| reply, in an offhand manner, "I don't know," smile, and
! refer the person to some department secretary. He
! might say, "Ask Miss Perkins. She might know."
Always there was that smile. I could see that "Mr.
| President" had gained the confidence of the Washing
ton correspondents. He was their trusted friend. Never
| before had a President treated members of the Press
lin such a friendly, informal way. Before the Roosevelt
regime, correspondents were forced to turn in all ques
tions, written, to the press secretary before the con
ferences. The President then chose questions which
he wanted to answer and disregarded the others. With
J Roosevelt, the "boys" were privileged to ask, orally,
j any question. Some kind of answer was always forth
■ coming.
Informality was the keynote of the conference. One
if the correspondents kidded the President about the
golf game that his secretary, Steve Early, played.
When a statement was made that was not to be
| quoted, the President would label that statement as
i 'off the record." The correspondents understood.
As for keeping in touch with the happenings in the
nation, Roosevelt was in the habit of looking over the
New York, Philadelphia, and Washington papers every
morning, besides religiously reading what Walter Lipp
man had to say about him and his "New Deal."
I On the wide expanse of the desk top stood the
symbol of the ranking party of the moment, a black
donkey, with a white elephant alongside. The usual
desk articles were also present—papers, books, a lamp,

The conference broke up after about a twenty
i minute session. Several of the "boys" lingered to pop
"after-time"' questions. Tbe other correspondents filed
1 out, wishing that the President had given more concrete
information so that they might have had that hoped-for
i big news to wire the home office.
Yet, to mc, the President was most satisfying. He
ranked at the top with the most likeable persons i
have ever met. He was a most polished politician,
just about in a class by himself.
One of the President's secretaries told me to look
| around the White House. I ambled into the cabinet

(on the Stanford Daily). I was told to appear at the
I Executive wing of the White House at 4 o'clock for

news from "Mr. President" was expected.
Long before the appointed time I was in the big,
j white-walled, officered reception room in the west wing.
1 Some of the "boys" of the press were in two lines out

I fell in with the others.
At the signal from Steve Early the "boys" whooped

I had directed the affairs of the nation. There was a rush
1 for a position at the front of the President's huge ma
hogany desks. Using tactics learned when trying to
get good seats at a football or basketball game, I found
myself standing directly in front of the Chief Executive.
Roosevelt was seated in his big, impressive chair.
Behind him stretched windows that looked out on the
rolling green lawns back of the White House. Seated
on the window ledge on both sides of the President
were two men, evidently in the secret service, dressed
in plain business clothes. Steve Early stood on the
i Chief's left to lead the discussion. Exactly as I had

I On the wide expanse of the desk top stood the

"after-time"' questions. Tbe other correspondents filed

information so that they might have had that hoped-for

Yet, to mc, the President was most satisfying. He
ranked at the top with the most likeable persons i
have ever met. He was a most polished politician,
just about in a class by himself.

First man of note in Washington on my list was
Franklin D. Roosevelt.
"Impossible" was the answer to my pleas to influon
i tial men to see the President. Congress was just break
! ing up, and the "head man" had his hands full trying
| to send his "boys" in Congress home.
Three secretaries and a few guards formed a rather
impenetrable barrier to inquisitive persons, trying "to
bust in" to meet the Chief. 1 went into a huddle with u
leading Washington correspondent of one of the New
I York papers to plan my offensive. He said that what I
asked had not been done before to his knowledge.
He rang up the White House and persuaded Sieve
I Early, press secretary, that I was an active newsman
(on the Stanford Daily). I was told to appear at the
I Executive wing of the White House at 4 o'clock for
the regular Friday afternoon press conference. Big
news from "Mr. President" was expected.
Long before the appointed time I was in the big,
j white-walled, officered reception room in the west wing.
1 Some of the "boys" of the press were in two lines out
• side the Executive office. My correspondent friend and
I fell in with the others.
At the signal from Steve Early the "boys" whooped
| into the sacred chamber where many famed Presidents
I had directed the affairs of the nation. There was a rush
1 for a position at the front of the President's huge ma
hogany desks. Using tactics learned when trying to
get good seats at a football or basketball game, I found
myself standing directly in front of the Chief Executive.
Roosevelt was seated in his big, impressive chair.
Behind him stretched windows that looked out on the
rolling green lawns back of the White House. Seated
on the window ledge on both sides of the President
were two men, evidently in the secret service, dressed
in plain business clothes. Steve Early stood on the
i Chief's left to lead the discussion. Exactly as I had
: seen in the movies and on the front pages, the President
j was all smiles. That much-talked-of, bubbling per
| sonality placed the correspondents perfectly at ease.
"Mr. President" was most impressive looking
as he sat in the coveted chair from which he did not
; rise once during the entire time I was in the room.
' He was large but not fat. His big frame was typical
' of that of some football player. He looked tired.
His eyes twitched nervously behind his glasses.
When the scribes settled down, Roosevelt greeted
' them informally. Before this, he had commented on a
i couple of the "boys' " white linen suits. Then he spoke
out. He disappointed the gathering by saying Ihat
there was "nothing new." The correspondents had
| hoped for words about the Japanese situation, the San
i Francisco longshoremen's strike, and the drought.
Correspondents might have disagreed with Roose
velt's theories or actions, but that feeling of opposition
dissolved before that smile and that magnetic, friendly
J personality. That winning smile would wear away the
I most fortified and entrenched resistance.
I Since no officially prepared comment was forthcom
! ing, one of the correspondents asked informally about
j a luncheon the President had with some Japanese dig
l nitary. With a smile—always that smile—Roosevelt ic
plied that no definite State affairs had been settled at
the informal luncheon. "We just ate," he summarized.
Question after question was popped at the Chief
Executive—about the NRA, drought damage, reforesta
| tion, and labor troubles. The President casually said
what he knew. If he didn't know the answer, he would
| reply, in an offhand manner, "I don't know," smile, and
! refer the person to some department secretary. He
! might say, "Ask Miss Perkins. She might know."
Always there was that smile. I could see that "Mr.
| President" had gained the confidence of the Washing
ton correspondents. He was their trusted friend. Never
| before had a President treated members of the Press
lin such a friendly, informal way. Before the Roosevelt
regime, correspondents were forced to turn in all ques
tions, written, to the press secretary before the con
ferences. The President then chose questions which
he wanted to answer and disregarded the others. With
J Roosevelt, the "boys" were privileged to ask, orally,
j any question. Some kind of answer was always forth
■ coming.
Informality was the keynote of the conference. One
if the correspondents kidded the President about the
golf game that his secretary, Steve Early, played.
