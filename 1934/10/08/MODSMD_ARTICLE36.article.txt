"Tin: AFFAIRS OF CELLINI"' (United Artists)
At the Stanford Theater

This amusing bedroom comedy,
though it may disappoint those who
have heard il hailed Ihe bos! pic
ture of the year, is witty and clover
and, above all, entertaining." Hon
ors go to Frank Morgan, whose
performance as the doddering duke
is his best to date, and In Con
stance Bennett an d Fredcric

March, who, though outshone by Morgan, arc peculiarly
well-fitted for their roles. B. Sweet.
