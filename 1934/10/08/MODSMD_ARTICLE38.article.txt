# CAMPUS OPINION
## THESE NEW WOMEN 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
To say that I am chagrined would
be an understatement of fact. Per
haps Mr. Irvin Jorgensen would
make clear just what qualities the
ideal "Stanford Woman" would pos
sess, we "New Women" might be
able to dish it out. So far, the Stan
ford men I have met seem to prefer
the Mae West type to all others. I
trust that Mr. Jorgensen realizes that
the Farm is now and forever a man's
institution, and that we women are
simply what you make us.
Yours,
Hearts and Flowers.
