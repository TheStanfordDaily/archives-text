## AN OPEN LETTER TO MR. UPTON SINCLAIR 
### 
Dear Uppy:
Never before have we seen the
Farm so aroused over a political
campaign. It is positively phenom
enal. EPIC is the ONLY thing that
stands a fair chance of breaking up
a pow-wow on the World Series. At
the moment, you are on an interest -
par with football, which should be
very, very flattering.
There are many here who are for
you heart, soul, and lungs. There
are many who think you are a
damned Communist, and that EPIC
is just another way these insidious
Russians have of disguising OGPU. '
There are still more who believe
Frank Merriam is the worst possible i
menace to good government in Cali
fornia, but cannot swallow EPIC
except in small doses. As Stanford
men and women, these latter rather
resent your slogan: "Put Merriam
with Hoover," for they would almost
rather see Merriam safely closeted in
Sacramento, than in the house next
door.
You see, Uppy, the situation is this:
Aside from the broad huilianitarian
aspects of your program, you are
making an appeal for EPIC support
on the basis of intelligent self-inter
est. You are also making a particu
lar appeal to college students. BUT,
while humanity heads many students
toward EPIC, self-interest almost
makes them do an about-face. Your
proposed taxes may well cut the'

financial support out from under j
many a rough and Indian maid,
leaving only the remnants of a So
cialistic smile.
The present system, while it may
be slightly sour, at least does keep
us in school. A complete system of
socialization, while it may be slightly 1
bitter, would aL«o keep us in school, j
Now all this Uppy, is rather steep j
competition. In order to tie it, EPIC
must promise to keep us at Stanford
—and not ship us over to Cal—or, j
God forbid, down the river to S.C.
In order to beat it, EPIC must not
only keep us here, but give us jobs [
later on.
Of course, Uppy, this must sound
like a very petty attitude, to one
who has devoted a lifetime to;
causes. But when we are told that
but 12 per cent of last year's college
graduates now have permanent jobs, :
it is no wonder that college students
should begin examining a plan for
the masses in terms of the plans of
; "number one."
Rest assured, Uppy, that few of us
care whether or not you are an
atheist, a vegetarian,#or have pink
tooth brush. We ARE rather in
terested, though, in learning whether !
your plan will take care of what we ;
naturally consider to be the most im- ,
portant segment of the whole popu- '
lation. We hope it will.
With epic regard,
Dave MellinkofT.
