# SINCLAIR, MERRIAM PLATFORMS EARLY DEBATE SUBJECT
## 
### 
Interest should run high in cam
pus debates this quarter with the
announcement by Coach Lee Chapin
that the topic for early debates will
be that most exciting of events, the
coming gubernatorial election, and
will involve a full discussion of the
respective candidates and their plat
forms. Formal wording of the ques
tion has not yet been determined,
but "Resolved: That Merriam should
be elected governor of California"
has been mentioned as a possibility,
and may be adopted.
It is suggested that all students in
terested in trying out for any of the
debates to be held upon this subject
should commence work on the ques
tion at once.
This topic will undoubtedly cause
increased interest in Stanford de
bates. for it is felt certain that all the
Republicans, Democrats, conserva
tives, and radicals who inhabit the
Stanford campus will come forth to
support their political views, Chapin
said.
