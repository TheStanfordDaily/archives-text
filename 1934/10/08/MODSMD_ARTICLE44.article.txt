lIIG EVENT
COMING
V/ith the preliminaries of registra
tion over, Stanford women interested
in'sports turn at once to planning
for one of the biggest days of the
women's athletic calendar, not far
off now.
On November 17th Stanford will
lx! host to the be.st women athletes
from California and Mills in tennis,
archery, golf, swimming, and hockey
competition.
' It's too early yet to pick out the
future stars among the new women,
but according to rumors they will do
their share toward piling up points
for Stanford. The new women seem
to be unusually interested in hockey
to judge from the large registration
in that sport.
VETERANS
RETURN
We still have some outstanding
veterans in all the sports who are
good enough by themselves to give
Stanford a place on tri-sports day.
Although the scoring will probably
be on Ihe basis of interclass competi
tion, in the final analysis it is not
difficult to see whom it takes to win.
It will be hard to beat Kitty
Alliens, realizing that she is now the
Junior Women's Champion miler.
Kitty is also manager of swimming
ibis year and will be glad to be able
to count on the skill of Lee Stearns.
Lee suffered a severe injury to her
back early last spring, but is very
enthusiastic about going on from
where she left off.
In tennis we have Elizabeth Kest
iug of national ranking whom it was
impossible to dislodge from ine top
of the tennis ladder during the en
tire past year. It looks as though
Margaret Diedrich will again be sec
ond to none but Kesting with Alice
Philp as a dangerous challenger.
Tennis is a strong division, and to
mention these three is not to tell the
whole story for there are six or
eight near the top who can provide
plenty of competition.
AMj DIVISIONS
STRONG STILL
Joan MacGowan, winner of last
spring's golf championship, is back
again and Dorothy Lyman, golf man
ager, and runner up to Joan. These
two will lie very much in the way of
visiting golfers who expect to win
ihe golf driving contest on tri-sports
day.
Helen Grover, hockey manager,
has a large department this year
with a goodly sprinkling of last
year's stars. To mention a few: Ger
trude Whitaker, Birdie Boyles, Ada
Martin, Babe Dear, and Sue Ward.
Kay Moran, sophomore, will be tech
nical assistant to Miss King, instruc
tor.
Archers are headed by Kay Thor
bjirn, a winner of many medals in
national meets and to us seems un
beatable. All the archery classes are
full, pointing to a very successful
year and to a banner tri-sports day.
