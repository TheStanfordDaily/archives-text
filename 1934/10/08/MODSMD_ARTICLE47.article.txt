# Freshmen Trounce Menlo 27 to 0
## COFFIS RACES 40 YARDS TO SCORE ON PUNT RETURN 
### 
After a shaky and ragged first half, |
Stanford's widely heralded 1934
Frosh football team came back with
a clicking offensive scoring punch j
to win their season's opener and trim ;
Menlo Junior College by a 27-0 j
margin.
At the opening of the first quar-.j
ter, the play was in Menlo's favor, j
with fullback Brigham too shifty and !
driving for the Frosh to handle. The
Frosh had the plays but not the abil- j
ity to execute them, dropping sev- i
eral passes and playing ragged ball
in general.
Collins Scores First
End Bob Dakan took a pass on the j
Menlo 24-yard line early in the j
game. Jim Soffis, quarter, caught a |
pass from Glenn Hamilton on the j
7-yard line; Bill Paulman bucked to |
. j
the one-yard line; Menlo stopped
one play at the line of scrimmage, j
and then Tom Collins reversed and J
crossed the line standing up. Paul
man converted for the extra point. I
making the score 7-0.
Late in this second quarter Menlo j
lost her most consistent and danger- j
oils ball carrier when Brigham and
Bob Dakan of the Frosh became a I
bit over-enthusiastic in endeavoring !
to advance their cause and resorted !
to fisticuffs, but the slugging only got |
both boys as far as the showers.
Power Plays Tally
The Frosh drive did not open up
until late in the third quarter. Paul
man passed 17 yards to John Wyeth, i
who was downed on the four-yard |
line. Line bucks by Paulman and i
Coffls gained two yards each. Then I
Paulman passed over the goal line i
to Berneth Layer for the score. The i
conversimi was wide.
The third touchdown came about'
the middle of the fourth quarter
when Jimmy Coffis raced a punt 40 i
yards to the score, with Paulman I
converting. The Frosh attained their I
fourth touchdown by power-plays j
on the "slam-bang bucks'' of the old J
days. Hamilton did most of the tot- ;
ing, cai'ried the ball on the touch- j
down play, and did the converting, I
leaving the final score 27-0.
Menlo Offense Stopped
Menlo, though doped as having its!
strongest team in three years, did i
not compare with the team that won j
from the last year's frosh 9-6. On I
the other hand, the Frosh gave evi- j
dence of developing into a ball club ]
which will be hard to beat, once j
teamwork and experience are added
to natural ability. The line settled
down after the first few minutes and |
had little difficulty in stopping Men- ;
lo's offense, besides succeeding in
working their backs into the clear on
most of the reverses.
But the dash and color of the |
Frosh play was supplied by the
backs, not only strong in numbers j
but versatile in ability. Easily the
pick of these classy ball packers for
piay against Menlo was Glenn Ham
ilton, a rugged, tousle-headed fellow j
whose main forte is passing. Ham- i
ilton, brother to the "Ham" Hamilton j
who made grid history at College of |
the Pacific last year and who is now
playing for the Antioch profession
als, not only throws his passes with
bullet-like accuracy, but can throw 1
them half the distance of the field i
with ease. Given two weeks, Coach i
Bradshaw can develop, out of good '
end material, receivers which will
make the Frosh dangerous no matter
how far from the goal line and how |
late in the game.
Hamilton's punting was obviously
off-form Saturday but he punched
the Menlo line with effectiveness late
in the fourth quarter and carried the
ball on the last Frosh touchdown.
Ends Show Promise
Another back who caught the eye
of the fans was San Francisco's
Jimmy Coffis. Coffis' stockily dis
tributed 170 pounds and piston-like
running style, plus better than av
erage speed make him hard to get, j
and harder to drop. Coffis contrib
uted the third Frosh score by grab- ;
bing Goodnow's punt on the Menlo
40-yard line, then sidestepping and
dodging his way to the goal, behind |

the effective blocking of his team
mates.
Tommy Collins looked fast on the
first touchdown and gained consist
ently on reverses. In the line Nelly
Heath at center stood out defensively
while Bob Dakan, John Wyeth, and
Berneth Layer are three ends who
are aggressive on defense.

Hamilton's punting was obviously
off-form Saturday but he punched
the Menlo line with effectiveness late
in the fourth quarter and carried the
ball on the last Frosh touchdown.
Ends Show Promise
Another back who caught the eye
of the fans was San Francisco's
Jimmy Coffis. Coffis' stockily dis
tributed 170 pounds and piston-like
running style, plus better than av
erage speed make him hard to get, j
and harder to drop. Coffis contrib
uted the third Frosh score by grab- ;
bing Goodnow's punt on the Menlo
40-yard line, then sidestepping and
dodging his way to the goal, behind |

the effective blocking of his team
mates.
Tommy Collins looked fast on the
first touchdown and gained consist
ently on reverses. In the line Nelly
Heath at center stood out defensively
while Bob Dakan, John Wyeth, and
Berneth Layer are three ends who
are aggressive on defense.
After a shaky and ragged first half, |
Stanford's widely heralded 1934
Frosh football team came back with
a clicking offensive scoring punch j
to win their season's opener and trim ;
Menlo Junior College by a 27-0 j
margin.
At the opening of the first quar-.j
ter, the play was in Menlo's favor, j
with fullback Brigham too shifty and !
driving for the Frosh to handle. The
Frosh had the plays but not the abil- j
ity to execute them, dropping sev- i
eral passes and playing ragged ball
in general.
Collins Scores First
End Bob Dakan took a pass on the j
Menlo 24-yard line early in the j
game. Jim Soffis, quarter, caught a |
pass from Glenn Hamilton on the j
7-yard line; Bill Paulman bucked to |
. j
the one-yard line; Menlo stopped
one play at the line of scrimmage, j
and then Tom Collins reversed and J
crossed the line standing up. Paul
man converted for the extra point. I
making the score 7-0.
Late in this second quarter Menlo j
lost her most consistent and danger- j
oils ball carrier when Brigham and
Bob Dakan of the Frosh became a I
bit over-enthusiastic in endeavoring !
to advance their cause and resorted !
to fisticuffs, but the slugging only got |
both boys as far as the showers.
Power Plays Tally
The Frosh drive did not open up
until late in the third quarter. Paul
man passed 17 yards to John Wyeth, i
who was downed on the four-yard |
line. Line bucks by Paulman and i
Coffls gained two yards each. Then I
Paulman passed over the goal line i
to Berneth Layer for the score. The i
conversimi was wide.
The third touchdown came about'
the middle of the fourth quarter
when Jimmy Coffis raced a punt 40 i
yards to the score, with Paulman I
converting. The Frosh attained their I
fourth touchdown by power-plays j
on the "slam-bang bucks'' of the old J
days. Hamilton did most of the tot- ;
ing, cai'ried the ball on the touch- j
down play, and did the converting, I
leaving the final score 27-0.
Menlo Offense Stopped
Menlo, though doped as having its!
strongest team in three years, did i
not compare with the team that won j
from the last year's frosh 9-6. On I
the other hand, the Frosh gave evi- j
dence of developing into a ball club ]
which will be hard to beat, once j
teamwork and experience are added
to natural ability. The line settled
down after the first few minutes and |
had little difficulty in stopping Men- ;
lo's offense, besides succeeding in
working their backs into the clear on
most of the reverses.
But the dash and color of the |
Frosh play was supplied by the
backs, not only strong in numbers j
but versatile in ability. Easily the
pick of these classy ball packers for
piay against Menlo was Glenn Ham
ilton, a rugged, tousle-headed fellow j
whose main forte is passing. Ham- i
ilton, brother to the "Ham" Hamilton j
who made grid history at College of |
the Pacific last year and who is now
playing for the Antioch profession
als, not only throws his passes with
bullet-like accuracy, but can throw 1
them half the distance of the field i
with ease. Given two weeks, Coach i
Bradshaw can develop, out of good '
end material, receivers which will
make the Frosh dangerous no matter
how far from the goal line and how |
late in the game.

working their backs into the clear on
most of the reverses.
But the dash and color of the |
Frosh play was supplied by the
backs, not only strong in numbers j
but versatile in ability. Easily the
pick of these classy ball packers for
piay against Menlo was Glenn Ham
ilton, a rugged, tousle-headed fellow j
whose main forte is passing. Ham- i
ilton, brother to the "Ham" Hamilton j
who made grid history at College of |
the Pacific last year and who is now
playing for the Antioch profession
als, not only throws his passes with
bullet-like accuracy, but can throw 1
them half the distance of the field i
with ease. Given two weeks, Coach i
Bradshaw can develop, out of good '
end material, receivers which will
make the Frosh dangerous no matter
how far from the goal line and how |
late in the game.
Hamilton's punting was obviously
off-form Saturday but he punched
the Menlo line with effectiveness late
in the fourth quarter and carried the
ball on the last Frosh touchdown.
Ends Show Promise
Another back who caught the eye
of the fans was San Francisco's
Jimmy Coffis. Coffis' stockily dis
tributed 170 pounds and piston-like
running style, plus better than av
erage speed make him hard to get, j
and harder to drop. Coffis contrib
uted the third Frosh score by grab- ;
bing Goodnow's punt on the Menlo
40-yard line, then sidestepping and
dodging his way to the goal, behind |

the effective blocking of his team
mates.
Tommy Collins looked fast on the
first touchdown and gained consist
ently on reverses. In the line Nelly
Heath at center stood out defensively
while Bob Dakan, John Wyeth, and
Berneth Layer are three ends who
are aggressive on defense.
After a shaky and ragged first half, |
Stanford's widely heralded 1934
Frosh football team came back with
a clicking offensive scoring punch j
to win their season's opener and trim ;
Menlo Junior College by a 27-0 j
margin.
At the opening of the first quar-.j
ter, the play was in Menlo's favor, j
with fullback Brigham too shifty and !
driving for the Frosh to handle. The
Frosh had the plays but not the abil- j
ity to execute them, dropping sev- i
eral passes and playing ragged ball
in general.
Collins Scores First
End Bob Dakan took a pass on the j
Menlo 24-yard line early in the j
game. Jim Soffis, quarter, caught a |
pass from Glenn Hamilton on the j
7-yard line; Bill Paulman bucked to |
. j
the one-yard line; Menlo stopped
one play at the line of scrimmage, j
and then Tom Collins reversed and J
crossed the line standing up. Paul
man converted for the extra point. I
making the score 7-0.
Late in this second quarter Menlo j
lost her most consistent and danger- j
oils ball carrier when Brigham and
Bob Dakan of the Frosh became a I
bit over-enthusiastic in endeavoring !
to advance their cause and resorted !
to fisticuffs, but the slugging only got |
both boys as far as the showers.
Power Plays Tally
The Frosh drive did not open up
until late in the third quarter. Paul
man passed 17 yards to John Wyeth, i
who was downed on the four-yard |
line. Line bucks by Paulman and i
Coffls gained two yards each. Then I
Paulman passed over the goal line i
to Berneth Layer for the score. The i
conversimi was wide.
The third touchdown came about'
the middle of the fourth quarter
when Jimmy Coffis raced a punt 40 i
yards to the score, with Paulman I
converting. The Frosh attained their I
fourth touchdown by power-plays j
on the "slam-bang bucks'' of the old J
days. Hamilton did most of the tot- ;
ing, cai'ried the ball on the touch- j
down play, and did the converting, I
leaving the final score 27-0.
Menlo Offense Stopped
Menlo, though doped as having its!
strongest team in three years, did i
not compare with the team that won j
from the last year's frosh 9-6. On I
the other hand, the Frosh gave evi- j
dence of developing into a ball club ]
which will be hard to beat, once j
teamwork and experience are added
to natural ability. The line settled
down after the first few minutes and |
had little difficulty in stopping Men- ;
lo's offense, besides succeeding in
working their backs into the clear on
most of the reverses.
