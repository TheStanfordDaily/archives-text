the Card varsity displaying a brand
ot play appallingly ragged even for

and sent in an entirely new eleven,
the second string. Within a few
minutes the forward line began to
click. The ball was advanced down
the right wing, crossed to left winger
Ed Nightingale, and passed to Pete
Knecht at center forward who
rammed a fast shot home for the
first score.

Composed mostly of sophomores,
the B-squad kept up a fairly even
attack on the San Jose goal for the
remainder of the quarter, but no

again was sent in and again their
play was ragged. The third quarter
was played through with but a few
attacks at the San Jose goal.

scored goal.
White, Vierling Steady
San Jose, with a new, inexperi
enced squad, threatened the Indian
goal but occasionally; only once came

before him, a San Jose forward
kicked completely over the stand
ards.
Waddy White at left half and Bar
ney Vierling at left back displayed
the most consistent play throughout
the game. Heckman, center half.
