### 
MADRID, Oct. 7 (TP). â€”Catalonia's
revolution for independence col
lapsed under heavy shell fire early
today, and the Spanish government
apparently was smashing down a
three-day red revolt that cost up
ward of 500 lives and 2500 casualties
throughout Spain.
Leaders of the Catalonia secession,
including President Luis Companys,
were captured in a short lived civil
war and marched through silent
crowds to a prison ship in Barcelona
harbor where they are to be court
martialed and probably sentenced to
death.
They surrendered at 6:30 a.m.
with Spanish destroyers and foreign
legionnaires from Morocco converg
ing on the Catalonian political cita
del.
