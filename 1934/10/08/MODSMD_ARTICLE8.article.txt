â€¢
Detroits 3 to 1 victory over the
St. Loui.s Cardinals in the lifth game
of the World Series yesterday sends
the warring forces to Detroit for to
day's game vvilh the Tigers holding a
3 to 2 margin of victory over their
National League opponents.
Rowe Rested
Detroit's ace, "Schoolboy" Rowe,
rested and ready, will, according to
Manager Mickey Cochrane, try to
hurl the Tigers to the championship
today. Manager Frisch of the Cards
was undecided last night as to' his
starting pitcher, naming either Bill
Hallahan, whom Rowe defeated in
the second game, or Paul Dean.
Despite the hurling of the great
Jerome Herman (Dizzy) Dean, base
ball's most celebrated pitching fig
ure, the Cardinals were subdued by
the he, ( vy hitting Tigers behind the
sensational come-back performance
of Tommy Bridges.
Large Crowd in Stands
The biggest crovAl of the three
game series here, numbering 38,536
cash customers and packing Sports
man's Park, saw their idol knocked
off his pedestal and decisively out
pitched from start to finish by
Bridges.
Bill Delancey's homer, a drive that
landed on top of the roof of the right
field pavilion, kept Bridges from a
shut-out but the Cardinal's backstop
fanned with his bat on his shoulder
in the ninth after Frank Frisch had
singled and raced to third on Col
lins' drive against the right-field
screen. It was a close call for the
Tiger pitcher as Collins' smash
missed going over the barrier by only
a few feet, for a homer, but he
steadied down quickly and retired
pinch hitter Orsatti after fanning
Delancey.
Delancey Homes
Until the seventh, when Delancey
connected for his round-trip wallop,
only two Cardinal runners got as far
as second base. Both of them were
named Martin. Pepper singled and
advanced on a wild pitch in the first.
He doubled with one out in the sixth
but Jack Rothrock, Frisch, and Joe
lVledwick failed to do anything dam
aging on either occasion. The only
other Cardinal flurry came in the
ninth.
Dean Fades
Meanwhile the Tigers kept blasting
away at Dean's fast ball and with the
aid of another slipshod day by the
Cardinals in ihe field, gave Bridges
all the margin he needed to come
through on top. The revamped De
troit batting order again proved ef
fective and the Bengals throughout
played with dash and confidence.
Di/.zy paved the way for the first
Tiger rally by passing Greenberg
with one out in the second.
In regard to betting on today's
game, Tom Kearney, St. Louis bet
ting commissioner, last night offered
1 to 4 that Detroit would not win the
World Series, and 2V'2 to 1 that the
Cardinals would not win. Kearney
made the Tigers a 7 to 10 shot to win
today and quoted the Cardinals at
even money.
