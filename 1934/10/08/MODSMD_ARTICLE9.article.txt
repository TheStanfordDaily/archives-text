Unprecedented enrollment, to
gether with added influx of women
to the Stanford Farm this quarter,
may account for the attendance at
the President's Reception, the larg
est in history, held Saturday evening
for all new students.
After a hand-shaking escapade ri

President Ray Lyman Wilbur was
still able to smile and remark that
he though it "a very interesting
group of students this year."
