# F. R. MAY FORCE ARBITRATION ON BIG BUSINESS
## William Green Says "Yes And No; No and Yes" To Daily Reporter PERKINS SOFT-SOAPS A.F.L. Convention Means Big Doing in S.F. 
### DAVE MELLINKOFF 
The American Federation of La
bor, which st'ill boasts that "Labor
Omnia Vincet," is conventioning in
San Francisco. It is meeting today,
and met all last week; that is, it met
for five days last week —to show that
organized labor believes in shorter
working hours—and then adjourned
for a rubber-neck to Mt. Tamalpais
just when The Daily decided to cover
the convention. .
But while the rank-and-file lead
ers of the American labor movement
were off enjoying California sun
shine, labor big-shots were still in
town. Perkins was there; Green was
there; and so was Assistant Secre
tary of Labor McGrady; all were
ready to talk.
Perkins N.S.G.
Madame Secretary Perkins led off
the day with a "support the Presi
dent" address to the Commonwealth
Club of San Francisco — the Bay
City's super-Rotary. She came to
soft-soap California industrialists
into stomaching the plans for social
insurance which F.R. will present to
his next Congress. The air was thick
with Ivory. She told her listeners
that all intelligent and enlightened
people, like she knew Common
weal thers were, favored shorter
hours and unemployment and old
age insurance.
But the good lady had missed her
guess. Except for courtesy applause
before and after Miss Perkins spoke,
the house was dead silent. Ob
viously, they did not like this sort of
stuff, even from the plump and
charming Madame Secretary. Bald
heads and dour faces hurried away
in town-cars.
McGrady Forceful
When I later mentioned to Assist
ant Secretary McGrady — he the
clapper member of the strike arbi
tration board—that the Common
wealth Club had not received well
Miss Perkins' remarks on social in
surance and such, he chewed out:
"Well, that's just too bad"—indi
cating that they would take' the
Rooseveltian plan and like it—or take
it regardless.
McGrady expected the decision of
the longshore strike arbitration
board to be handed down this week,
but could not say more of the matter.
His remarks "off the record" were
most astonishing.
Green Described
Five floors up from the smoky,
iioisy lobby of the Whitcomb Hotel
was President Green, chief high
mogul of the A.F. of L. William
Green, built on the broad-beamed
lines of a big-business executive,
looks like anything but a leader of
workingmen. One could not at all
associate him with the puddlers in
the steel mills of Pennsylvania, or the
stevedores on the docks of San
Francisco. He is a serious man, and
a cautious one—carefully presenting
the "yeses" and the "noes" of every
question put to him.
The problem of industrial (ver
tical) unions as opposed to the
smaller craft unions is apparently
going to be one of the hot issues of
the convention. What did President
Green think of that? Well, there was
some good in each system. The fall
of the old Knights of Labor, he said,
showed that complete organization
by industrial unions could not suc
ceed. He believed that the interests
of all laborers were definitely not
alike. On the other hand, Green saw
the need for united action by indus
trial unions in some industries. He
said the A. F. of L. was already
forming such—in autos, rubber, and
about 1200 other fields.
If the Convention stays with
Green (and it probably will), it will
adopt a compromise resolution keep
ing craft unions in some industries,
industrial unions in others.
Green Side-steps
Unlike professors of political sci
ence, the president of the A. F. of L.
was non-plussed to explain how the

! Germans had ever been duped into
Fascism, but did not expect Fascism
j or Communism to come to America.
] He recognized in "vigilante" groups
an enemy of labor, but believed it
j was best not to jump into the fray
| as long as the "vigilantes" were at
tacking only Communists.
What will surprise not a few was
Green's firm conviction that the
' American labor movement is a mili
! tant movement. He said that despite
I Roosevelt's proposal for industrial
peace, labor will never give up its
right to strike. Further, Mr. Wil
liam Green believes in "militant
strikes."
"New Deal Has Helped"
The New Deal, he thought, has
"helped in many ways, but has not
| fulfilled our expectations." On the

''good" side, he mentioned abolition
of sweat shops, minimum wage rates,
! and official recognition fo labor's
right to organize arjd bargain collec
tively. On the "bad" side—well,
i there was a bad side; and that was
1 all.
! With the advice that one would
) find an A. F. of L. convention meet
-1 ing far better than a class in eco-
I nomics, the president of America's
largest labor t organization bade
i goodbye, and retired to interview
another visitor, and to worry over
his plans for re-election.
