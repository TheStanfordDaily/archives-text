# New Dramatic Director Has Varied Background
## 
### 
Since his birth shortly after mid
night on November 6, 1906, in the
middle of the Ohio River (Explana
tion: There happened to be an
island) William Murray Timmons,
new dramatic director, has possessed
a sense of the dramatic.
In high school, he appeared in
every play for which he was eligible,
and perhaps some he His
firmly announced determination to
be a professional actor, however, was j
soon supplanted by the equally
firm conviction that acting, from the
educational point of view, was fully
as interesting and a great deal more
remunerative.
Pleasing Personality
Today, occupying the position last
year vacated by Harold Helvenston,
Timmons is 27, tall, broadshouldered,
good in golf, with a spontaneous
smile and pleasing sense of humor.
He will undoubtedly acquire a repu
tation as one of Stanford's best-look
ing and most easy-to-interview per
sonalities.
After high school, he attended j
Muskingum College, correctly j
spelled only by native Ohioans. Here
he appeared in productions ranging
from "Disraeli" and Phillip Brry's
"Yuletide" to "The Lamp and the
Bell," Edna St. Vincent Millay's po
etic brain-child, in which he played
the lead.

(the local honorary dramatic organi- 1

note—these are only a few examples I
of his interest and ability along for- !
ensic lines.
Competent Director
Graduation brought with it a posi- '

tion as head of the Department of
Speech and English at Ross High j
School, in Fremont, Ohio, which j
Timmons held for six years, produc- j
ing four plays per year at Ross, be- |
sides an even greater number for |
the local Community Theater.
Before expiration of the six years,
Timmons had acquired an M.A. at
Columbia, mainly during summers J
and his one year of leave, and a wife.!
Having arrived at Stanford, he has ,
observed that Stanford students seem
actually to have enrolled because of
interest, not. grade points. And that
the climate is all that local Cham
bers of Commerce claim it to be.

Since his birth shortly after mid
night on November 6, 1906, in the
middle of the Ohio River (Explana
tion: There happened to be an
island) William Murray Timmons,
new dramatic director, has possessed
a sense of the dramatic.
In high school, he appeared in
every play for which he was eligible,
and perhaps some he His
firmly announced determination to
be a professional actor, however, was j
soon supplanted by the equally
firm conviction that acting, from the
educational point of view, was fully
as interesting and a great deal more
remunerative.
Pleasing Personality
Today, occupying the position last
year vacated by Harold Helvenston,
Timmons is 27, tall, broadshouldered,
good in golf, with a spontaneous
smile and pleasing sense of humor.
He will undoubtedly acquire a repu
tation as one of Stanford's best-look
ing and most easy-to-interview per
sonalities.
After high school, he attended j
Muskingum College, correctly j
spelled only by native Ohioans. Here
he appeared in productions ranging
from "Disraeli" and Phillip Brry's
"Yuletide" to "The Lamp and the
Bell," Edna St. Vincent Millay's po
etic brain-child, in which he played
the lead.
