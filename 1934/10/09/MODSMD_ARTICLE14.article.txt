# Actors Make Campus Visit
## 
### 
Four prominent members of the
cast of Max Reinhardt's "A Midsum
mer Night's Dream,"' now playing at'
the War Memorial Opera House in
San Francisco, yesterday honored
the Stanford campus with a visit.
In the party were Evelyn Venable,
who plays the part of Helena; Julie
Haydon, who takes the difficult role
of Titania, queen of the fairies; Felix
Weixberger, assistant to Mr. Rein
hardt, and Hal Moore.
In the morning, the group audited
Dr. Margery Bailey's class in Shake
speare. Then they were the guests
of Sword and Sandals for lunch at
the Stanford Union.
During lunch Miss Venable related
a humorous incident which occurred
when she attended a recent tea. An
elderly lady approached her and
asked, "My dear, are you a member
of the cast?"
"Why, yes," replied Miss Venable,
"I play Helena." Upon which the old
lady gaspingly replied, "Oh, my! a
principal! DO have some salad!"
was visited. All agreed that the quar
ters of the girls were almost as
sumptuous as recent newspaper de
scriptions. The Stanford Chapel was
also admired.
The biggest laugh of the afternoon
occurred when the party trod the
creaking boards of the Stanford
stage. The mid-Victorian roccoco of
the proscenium arches (yes, there
are several) and the lavish back
stage dome were all a source of just
amusement.
However, before returning to San
Francisco the players said th.it they
were much impressed with the cam
pus as a whole and that they were
almost tempted to renounce the
theater for the joys of collegiate lif".
The heavy student demand to see
"A Midsummer Night's Dram" has
prompted the California Festival as
sociation to announce a special rate
for tonight's performance.
