MADRID, Oct. B.—A military die
tutorship for revolt-torn. Spain was
forecast in responsible congressional
circles tonight as nobles of the erst
while monarchy joined 12,000 retired
army officers in offering aid to the
right-wing government of Premeir
Alejandro Lerroux.
MADRID, Oct. B.—Spain's right
wing government strove tonight to
mop up in the bloody wake of the
radical revolution that threatened
for four days to overthrow it, at the
same time that reports from Cadiz
told of a communist republic being
declared at the nearby ,towu of
Pardo del Rey, where rebels set
fire to the City Hall and all churches,
destroyed municipal archives and
killed the Mayor and several other
dissenting citizens.
Troops staunchily loyal to Pre
mier Alejandro Lerroux and his gov
ernment utilized airplanes, artillery
and ships of war—every death deal
ing devic of modern warfare —to
stamp out secession in Catalonia, re
bellion in Asturias and sovietism in
Southern Spain.
Defeated at many places in open
combat, the rebels in Madrid and
elsewhere took the guerilla warfare,
utilizing the cover of darkness to
snipe at soldiers from housetops.
The death toll, previously esti
mated at 500 lives, climbed steadily
into the uncounted hundreds—un
counted because rebels made wreck
age of Spain's communications. A
thousand and more suffered wounds
—to add to the 3000 casualties earlier
figured. Hundreds and hundreds
were prisoners.
