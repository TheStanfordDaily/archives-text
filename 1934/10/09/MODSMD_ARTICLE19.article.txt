## 
### 
*Dean Mary Yost was the guest of
Roble Club at dinner yesterday eve
ning. In her after dinner speech tr>
the freshman group, Miss Yost ex
plained that Roble had been chosen
as the freshman women's dormitory
first because it was the largest hall.
In the second place a closer class
feeling is developed when the mem
bers of the class arc sharing new
experiences together.
From her wide experience first as
a student, then as a dean, Mi.ss Yost
warned the new women against
keeping late hours consistently. She
advisd a wise budgeting of time. In
regard to the drinking problem, Mi.ss
Yost stressed the regulation against
drinking on the campus. Off-campus
drinking, said Mi.ss Yost, was a mat
ter of personal judgment and discre
tion, so long as a student did not
brine discredit to the University.
