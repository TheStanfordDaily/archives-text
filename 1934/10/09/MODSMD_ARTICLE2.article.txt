## Fielder's Nightmare of Early Innings Turns to Brilliant Pitcher's Duel at Finish 
### 
NAVIN FIELD, DETROIT, Oct. 8
(/P). —The St. Louis Cardinals, after
cracking miserably afield, rose to
the most brilliant heights of the
World Series today to drive to vic
tory behind young Paul Dean, de
feat the great Lynwood "School
boy" Rowe, and win the sixth game,
4 to 3, tieing the series count at
three games each.
The Cardinals got young Dean,
who allowed but seven hits, five of
them of the scratchy variety, into all
kinds of trouble in the early innings,
then pulled him out with a great de
fensive display which reached a
height in the seventh inning when
Frankie Frisch cut of! a run at the
plate and Bill Delancey nipped Jo-
Jo White at second base on an at
tempted steal to end the inning.
The Cardinal hitting attack was led
by Leo Durocher, who pounded out
three hits and scored two runs,
while young Dean was winning his;

second game of the series and put
ting the St. Louis team back on
even terms with the Tigers. Dean
drove in the winning run in the
seventh with a single to light after
Durocher had doubled.
The Cardinals touched Rowe for
10 hits, and Goose Goslin, steady
going war horse of the American
Leaguers, added to hit troubles with
a wild throw allowing Durocher to
score. Martin, who had singled,
reached third on the display and
scored when Rothrock grounded out.
The nightmare of the early inn
ings turned into brilliant baseball as
the two young pitchers battled down
to finish line. Rowe, who had al
lowed no bases on balls, struck out
five batters.
Dean got the last two men to face
him in the ninth, Pete Fox and Rowe,
on Jong drives that Orsatti pulled
down in center after Marvin Owen
had grounded.
