# It Is Colossal

### 
Almost eight hundred men and approxi
mately four hundred women have purchased
their rooters' tickets for Saturday's long
awiiited interseclional clash with the scrappy
Wildcats from Northwestern.
When 33 per ceitt of the Stanford student
body actually condescend to voice intentions
of paying a visit to the stadium to see a top
notch Indian varsity play a real brand of
football, we are simply Moored by the stu
pcndousness of the situation. Can it be true
I hat so many Stanford people are interested in
fool bull?
Anyway, the H.A.C. is allowing an extra day
of grace. A few additional rooters' ducats
are placed on sale today only for Saturday's
game, and when these are gone the remaining
will be sold to regular fans. Which will be
a lot of credit lo Stanford undergraduates.
How kind, lo be so generous and allow a
stranger lo buy his way into the Stanford
rooting section.
Evidently, we still have the Stanford gen
tlemen. Hut do they like football games? The
number of tickets sold today will be a good
answer.
