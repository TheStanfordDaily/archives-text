# Where Initiative Counts

### 
Oul of the turmoil of changing conditions
that is shaping a new Stanford at least one
time-honored tradition stands unshaken. The
original ideal of Senator and Mrs. Stanford
that students without money should be given
an equal opportunity in their search for
knowledge has survived the test of the years
surprisingly well.
Skeptics of course can point to the familiar
$114 barrier and to the years of depression
that have made it difficult to find sufficient
work either within a university or in the world
outside.
Although $114 in cash is a very difficult
thing to raise these days, the Stanford tuition
note plan, available to all who need, it, has
made it possible for hundreds of students to
attend college and pay off their obligations
when better able to do so. Though not rich
in scholarships, Stanford has compensated
for it by generosity with tuition loans, both
before and during the depression.
Work has been none too plentiful on the
Stanford campus in recent years but it can
be obtained if a student is persistent and not
too choosy. This year the prospect is some
what improved by the continuation of SERA
funds and the additional jobs created by
Lagunita Court and other improvements.
Stanford does not hand the needy student
an education on the proverbial silver platter
hut it does make every effort to help the self
supporting student. The University has come
through the years of the depression adhering,
if not perfectly, then remarkably well, to the
ideal of the founders â€” not any easy task to
accomplish.
