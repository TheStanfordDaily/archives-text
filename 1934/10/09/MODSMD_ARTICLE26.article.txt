### BOB JONES 
AL SMITH, THE "UNHAPPY WARRIOR"
Legends of the "Brown Derby" and the "Happy
Warrior" were mere myths that Monday morning in
late May when I invaded A1 Smith's suite of offices
on the thirty-second floor of his Empire State building
which stood towering over Fifth avenue in New York.
Seated at his massive desk in the far corner of his
rather large, empty room that looked out toward down
town New York and the Battery, A1 Smith was busy
chewing on one of those now-famous cigars of his
when I entered the room from the side.
His greeting was none too encouraging. He seemed
gruff.
The "Old Guard" member of the Democratic party
was not the genial host of pre-lj>2B days. His two
political defeats had evidently embittered the man. He
seemed to have a bone to pick with the world. He was
aggravated undoubtedly by my intrusion—just one of
those pesky, inquisitive college men—and from Stan
ford, of all places, whence came a man named Hoover
in 1928.
I asked him about journalism and present-day
trends in newspapers. He decried the absence of more
men like Walter Lippman to delve farther into political
matters than plain, surface indications and facts. He
suggested the development of more experienced
and learned writers who really studied politics and
wrote intelligently with an eye toward future events.
"Get to the basic and fundamental facts," he empha
sized, "before predicting outcomes."
When he spoke, his familiar New York twang,
learned or picked up when a boy in the East side, was
most noticeable.
After talking with him for fifteen minutes or so, he
"opened up," so to speak, some of his gruffness van
ished, and he became more genial. He chewed con
stantly on his half-smoked cigar. Now and then he
would take "time out" on the chewing process and
lay the stubby, mutilated cigar on the desk top, only to
put it back in the corner of his mouth again.
Then he stressed the importance of looking at both
sides of a question. He cited innumerable sources for
political information to represent the pro's and con's
for a subject under discussion.
I asked him to write his signature on a sheet of
paper I produced. "Certainly," was his answer. Re
verting again to his gruff way, he shouted to his
secretary in the next room. "My pen," he commanded.
As I was leaving he called me back. Playing the
part of his old political self, he asked me to give his
regards to his friends "out West."
Back to Washington tomorrow to take a look at
Secretary of State Hull.
