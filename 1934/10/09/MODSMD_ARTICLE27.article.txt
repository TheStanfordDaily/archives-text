### CHARLOTTE BURRIDGE 
WITH PROFESSOR ALBERT GUERARD
While gun fire continues to raise the 500 death toll
of the Spanish revolution, students and authorities of
world affairs prefer to remain silent on the probable
outcome, offering, rather, to explain the problem upon
which a peaceful settlement depends.
Professor Albert Guerard, whose articles were until
recently a regular Sunday feature of a leading San
Francisco paper when he stopped temporarily because
of other activities, summarizes the disturbance in Spain
as not merely a question of radicalism versus reaction.
It is also, he says, one of local autonomy versus
centralization: whether or not government should he
imposed upon independent peoples against their will.
He is in sympathy with the democratic principle that
artificial units of a national state should not he en
forced where there is no natural unity.
"I don't see why Catalonia shouldn't be as separate
from Castile as Portugal is from Spain. There is equally
as much difference linguistically and historically," he
said.
It seems that Barcelona and others of Spain's few
modern cities think they are being hampered by being
governed with, and in part by people of the more back
ward provinces.
"The problem of secession is involved. People don't
like the idea of breaking up Spain," Mr. Guerard said,
then went on to tell that Spain is the one country in
Europe that has nothing to fear from others. Since
the individual provinces are not threatened by foreign
invasion, he believes it would be more satisfactory to
let them govern themselves and end the constant threat
of civil war.
"If you leave people free to govern themselves, they
become peaceful with their sister governments. The
attempt to enforce government from without intensifies
dissatisfaction and ultimately causes graver trouble.
The more you try to make Catalonians into Castil
lians, the more they will rebel, the professor stated.
At present the provinces are merely asking for self
government, home rule. If refused, the desire may
grow to a crusade for complete independence, Mr.
Guerard believes. He places a great deal of importance
on the Spanish government's answer to the provinces.
Nn definite verdict has been given as yet.
"They should know how to handle their victory.
They should make concessions now. If I hey do not,
the situation will become dangerous.
"In case of a civil war between Catalonia and the
rest of Spain, Catalonia would not have much of a
chance of winning, but if, for any reason, there was a
general revolution in Spain, the Catalonian trouble
would come up again, and effect the situation. The
question cannot be settled by guns and bombardment,"
he stressed, it is a problem of regionalism versus cen
tralism or enforced unity. *

WITH PROFESSOR ALBERT GUERARD
While gun fire continues to raise the 500 death toll
of the Spanish revolution, students and authorities of
world affairs prefer to remain silent on the probable
outcome, offering, rather, to explain the problem upon
which a peaceful settlement depends.
Professor Albert Guerard, whose articles were until
recently a regular Sunday feature of a leading San
Francisco paper when he stopped temporarily because
of other activities, summarizes the disturbance in Spain
as not merely a question of radicalism versus reaction.
It is also, he says, one of local autonomy versus
centralization: whether or not government should he
imposed upon independent peoples against their will.
He is in sympathy with the democratic principle that
artificial units of a national state should not he en
forced where there is no natural unity.
"I don't see why Catalonia shouldn't be as separate
from Castile as Portugal is from Spain. There is equally
as much difference linguistically and historically," he
said.
It seems that Barcelona and others of Spain's few
modern cities think they are being hampered by being
governed with, and in part by people of the more back
ward provinces.
"The problem of secession is involved. People don't
like the idea of breaking up Spain," Mr. Guerard said,
then went on to tell that Spain is the one country in
Europe that has nothing to fear from others. Since
the individual provinces are not threatened by foreign
invasion, he believes it would be more satisfactory to
let them govern themselves and end the constant threat
of civil war.
