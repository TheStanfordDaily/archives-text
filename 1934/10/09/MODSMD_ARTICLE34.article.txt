"The Challenge to Liberty, by Her
bert Hoover. Chas Scribner's Sons.
New York.
This much-talked of book has just
come oil the press. Parts of it ran
serially in September issues of the
Saturday Evening Post. .
Former President Hoover starts
out by defining some of the terms he
is to employ constantly in the book,
such as "liberty," "freedom," "lib
eralism," and the "American sys
tem."
He then takes into account many
of the prevalent political philosophies
of the day, such as communism, so
cialism, fascism, and naziism. These
are then contrasted with the "Amer
ican system." The origin and growth
of the "American system" is then
traced, together with its accom
plishments.
Hoover then inquires into the
soundness of some of the measures
recently adopted by the federal gov
ernment toward regimentation and
national planning.
He finds in many of these polit
ical innovations or experiments,
threats to the continued well-being
of the "rugged individualism," which
he asserts has built the America of
today. Individual initiative and en
terprise must be preserved at all
hazards if progress is to continue.
"The manager's restless pillow has
done more to advance the practical
arts than all the legislation upon the
statut books. Competition curbs ra
pacity and attempts at economic
domination," is an excerpt from the
book which succinctly sets forth
Hoover's philosophy.
The book is undoubtedly a bril
liant exposition of one school of
political thought in our country. Few
statistics greet the reader's eye but
the book is rather designed to come
within the comprehension of the
great reading public. Two hundred
pages in length, the book may be
read at one sitting. â€”Larson.
