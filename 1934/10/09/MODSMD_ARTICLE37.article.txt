GRID EVENTS WILL
KILL ATTENDANCE
Football this year is going fairly
well for Stanford, but it is going very
badly for Stanford from a gate re
ceipt standpoint.
Events of the past two weeks, and
particularly of lust Saturday, will
shatter the Stanford Board of Ath
ictic Control's biggest chance in
many years to clean up on football.
When the schedule was announced
last year, the Indian directors'
jjiouths were watering in anticipa
tion of one of the best years on rec
ord, as four big home games and two
smaller ones were booked. Added to
this was the fact that for 1934, Card
inal potentialities were such as to
draw a capacity crowd to any game.
THINGS ARE NOT
GOING SO WELL
But now, in the midst of the early
season, things aren't going so well.
It all started a little over a week
atfo when Washington made a poor
showing by defeating Idaho with
a scanty 13 to •) score. And it was
climaxed last Saturday as El Tro
jan went down to an ignominious
defeat, the worst, from a score
standpoint, of any suffered by
U.S.C. in four years.
Contributory incidents to the
Board's financial groans were the
defeat of Northwestern by lowa last
week and U.C.L.A.'s trouncing at
the hands of Oregon two weeks ago.
IJRONCOS BEST
DRAWING CARD
Taking it chronologically, Stanford
opened the season against San Jose.
This game, of course, was not fig
ured for a huge income.
Then, with odds practically even,
Stanford met a popular Santa Clara
team on the next week-end. At
tendance records were shattered, and
officials here checked it off as a huge
success.
But even this record-smashing
crowd is somewhat disappointing
now as it is looked back on. It
was scheduled as the first of four
outstanding attractions, and many
of the more empty-pocketed cus
tomers, while admitting that the
game would probably be a thriller,
decided to wait for one of the
other three more traditional coin
hats. In the light of present oc
currences. they are beginning to
wonder if possibly they made a
mistake.
Although the Indians were a draw
ing card, the Oregon State game,
played under perfect climatic con
ditions in Portland, did not pull a
particularly large gathering for two
reasons. In the first place, it was
just the week before the historical
Oregon-Washington tangle, and most
of the pay-money was being saved
for this game. Secondly, Oregon
Slate had been beaten the preced
ing week by San Francisco Univer
sity, and Stanford was favored a bit
too heavily.
WILL WILDCATS
liE DISAPPOINTING?
Next Saturday Tiny Thornhill's
men meet Northwestern here in the I
second of the "naturals" on the home
grounds. But instead of being a
highly ballyhooed intersectionai
clash for supremacy, the game will
find Stanford a heavy favorite as .she
opens against the Wildcats.
That Northwestern, the team that !
held Stanford to a 0 to 0 tie, may
do it again, this writer does not I
deny. But the fact remains that they
will come from an underdog position
if Ihey should score this upset, and
John Public is not in the habit of
paying cash money to see a sure
thing.
Last Saturday the Wildcats lost.
20 to 7, to lowa, a good, but still i
only second-rate club of the Big Ten.
And last year's Northwestern record
will not do a groat deal towards
building gate receipts on the Farm.
In 1933, with a green team, the Ev
anston group proved to be defen
sively powerful, but lacked an offen
sive thrust, and consequently did not
win games.
The U.S.F. game in San Francisco
next week will draw, if present in
dications are any criterion. It will
draw a larger throng than any Don-
Card tilt ever has before.
The Dons beat Oregon State al
most as badly as did Stanford, and
they barely lost to Santa Clara in
a gam" similar to the Indian battle
with the Broncos. And to top that
off the fans remember one of the
most exciting and unusual games
of the 1933 program as that be
tween Stanford and San Francisco
University.
STANI ORD-TROY
CLASH A NATURAL
The following week finds U.S.C.
coming to Stanford. Everything
should have gone together to make
this game a complete sell-out. It
may still be a sell-out, but very few '

will be turned away.
In the first place, Stanford's
freshman vow, now being remem
bered by the juniors on Tiny's
squad, was, and is, a distinct draw
ing power. The 1932 frosh swore
they would not lose to Southern
California as long as they were in
college, and so far they haven't.
Secondly, Northern California has
its heart .set on actually seeing Tony
tumble, and it figures Stanford has
the best chance of accomplishing
this.
Then, the game should be a sell
rut just because it involves Stanford
and Southern California in athletic
competition.
But last week, U.S.C. lost, 0 to 19,
to Washington State College. Be
cause of all the factors that will make
the Card-Troy game a success, this
is not figured to stand too much in
the way of a capacity crowd. How
ever, it cannot help making Stanford
a fairly heavy favorite, unless some
thing unforeseen happens in the en
suing fortnight.
This writer, always wary of the
Southerners, particularly when
Stanford is favored, is speaking only
of the Indians' chances on paper
BEFORE the game. U.S.C. may be
as strong against the Cards this year
as ever before, but unless some
thing happens, Thornhill's Redmen
will be betting odds to win, which
might or might not affect the turn
stile.
BIG GAME WILL
STILL BE BIG
And so it goes. Stanford will go
South to meet U.C.L.A., and they
probably will be favored again, par
ticularly after the Bruins' 2(5 to 3
beating at the hands of Oregon.
Washington, too, after a slow start
this year, may be disappointing fi
nancially, unless the Huskies show
some power between now and No
vember 10.
The Big Game will be Big this
year. California is making a lot, of
claims, and two partial crowds will
come out to see them backed up, or
disproved, depending on alliance.
From this early season glance, the
Big Game at Berkeley will draw as
many people as the Memorial Sta
dium will hold.
All of these odds, of course, may
be changed, and some of them prob
ably will. For example, the U.S.C.,
Washington, and U.C.L.A. games will
all bring forth larger attendances
should Stanford lose to Northwest
ern this week end. Or any of those
three teams may blossom forth in
the next few weeks with new-found
power and bring the Cardinal sched
ule back to the gold-mine it looked
like as the season began.
At any rate, because the Indians
gathered themselves a reputation of
strength last year, and because they
have been showing off well so far
this season, the crowds generally will
be bigger than they have been on
the Farm in recent seasons.

was scheduled as the first of four
outstanding attractions, and many
of the more empty-pocketed cus
tomers, while admitting that the
game would probably be a thriller,
decided to wait for one of the
other three more traditional coin

currences. they are beginning to
wonder if possibly they made a

Although the Indians were a draw
ing card, the Oregon State game,
played under perfect climatic con
ditions in Portland, did not pull a
particularly large gathering for two
reasons. In the first place, it was
just the week before the historical
Oregon-Washington tangle, and most
of the pay-money was being saved
for this game. Secondly, Oregon
Slate had been beaten the preced
ing week by San Francisco Univer
sity, and Stanford was favored a bit
too heavily.
WILL WILDCATS
liE DISAPPOINTING?
Next Saturday Tiny Thornhill's
men meet Northwestern here in the I
second of the "naturals" on the home
grounds. But instead of being a
highly ballyhooed intersectionai
clash for supremacy, the game will
find Stanford a heavy favorite as .she
opens against the Wildcats.
That Northwestern, the team that !
held Stanford to a 0 to 0 tie, may
do it again, this writer does not I
deny. But the fact remains that they
will come from an underdog position
if Ihey should score this upset, and
John Public is not in the habit of
paying cash money to see a sure
thing.
Last Saturday the Wildcats lost.
20 to 7, to lowa, a good, but still i
only second-rate club of the Big Ten.
And last year's Northwestern record
will not do a groat deal towards
building gate receipts on the Farm.
In 1933, with a green team, the Ev
anston group proved to be defen
sively powerful, but lacked an offen
sive thrust, and consequently did not
win games.
The U.S.F. game in San Francisco
next week will draw, if present in
dications are any criterion. It will
draw a larger throng than any Don-
Card tilt ever has before.
The Dons beat Oregon State al
most as badly as did Stanford, and
they barely lost to Santa Clara in
a gam" similar to the Indian battle
with the Broncos. And to top that
off the fans remember one of the
most exciting and unusual games
of the 1933 program as that be
tween Stanford and San Francisco
University.
STANI ORD-TROY
CLASH A NATURAL
The following week finds U.S.C.
coming to Stanford. Everything
should have gone together to make
this game a complete sell-out. It
may still be a sell-out, but very few '

will be turned away.
In the first place, Stanford's
freshman vow, now being remem
bered by the juniors on Tiny's
squad, was, and is, a distinct draw
ing power. The 1932 frosh swore
they would not lose to Southern
California as long as they were in
college, and so far they haven't.
Secondly, Northern California has
its heart .set on actually seeing Tony
tumble, and it figures Stanford has
the best chance of accomplishing
this.
Then, the game should be a sell
rut just because it involves Stanford
and Southern California in athletic
competition.
But last week, U.S.C. lost, 0 to 19,
to Washington State College. Be
cause of all the factors that will make
the Card-Troy game a success, this
is not figured to stand too much in
the way of a capacity crowd. How
ever, it cannot help making Stanford
a fairly heavy favorite, unless some
thing unforeseen happens in the en
suing fortnight.
This writer, always wary of the
Southerners, particularly when
Stanford is favored, is speaking only
of the Indians' chances on paper
BEFORE the game. U.S.C. may be
as strong against the Cards this year
as ever before, but unless some
thing happens, Thornhill's Redmen
will be betting odds to win, which
might or might not affect the turn
stile.
BIG GAME WILL
STILL BE BIG
And so it goes. Stanford will go
South to meet U.C.L.A., and they
probably will be favored again, par
ticularly after the Bruins' 2(5 to 3
beating at the hands of Oregon.
Washington, too, after a slow start
this year, may be disappointing fi
nancially, unless the Huskies show
some power between now and No
vember 10.
The Big Game will be Big this
year. California is making a lot, of
claims, and two partial crowds will
come out to see them backed up, or
disproved, depending on alliance.
From this early season glance, the
Big Game at Berkeley will draw as
many people as the Memorial Sta
dium will hold.
All of these odds, of course, may
be changed, and some of them prob
ably will. For example, the U.S.C.,
Washington, and U.C.L.A. games will
all bring forth larger attendances
should Stanford lose to Northwest
ern this week end. Or any of those
three teams may blossom forth in
the next few weeks with new-found
power and bring the Cardinal sched
ule back to the gold-mine it looked
like as the season began.
At any rate, because the Indians
gathered themselves a reputation of
strength last year, and because they
have been showing off well so far
this season, the crowds generally will
be bigger than they have been on
the Farm in recent seasons.
GRID EVENTS WILL
KILL ATTENDANCE
Football this year is going fairly
well for Stanford, but it is going very
badly for Stanford from a gate re
ceipt standpoint.
Events of the past two weeks, and
particularly of lust Saturday, will
shatter the Stanford Board of Ath
ictic Control's biggest chance in
many years to clean up on football.
When the schedule was announced
last year, the Indian directors'
jjiouths were watering in anticipa
tion of one of the best years on rec
ord, as four big home games and two
smaller ones were booked. Added to
this was the fact that for 1934, Card
inal potentialities were such as to
draw a capacity crowd to any game.
THINGS ARE NOT
GOING SO WELL
But now, in the midst of the early
season, things aren't going so well.
It all started a little over a week
atfo when Washington made a poor
showing by defeating Idaho with
a scanty 13 to •) score. And it was
climaxed last Saturday as El Tro
jan went down to an ignominious
defeat, the worst, from a score
standpoint, of any suffered by
U.S.C. in four years.
Contributory incidents to the
Board's financial groans were the
defeat of Northwestern by lowa last
week and U.C.L.A.'s trouncing at
the hands of Oregon two weeks ago.

Taking it chronologically, Stanford
opened the season against San Jose.
This game, of course, was not fig

Then, with odds practically even,
Stanford met a popular Santa Clara
team on the next week-end. At
tendance records were shattered, and
officials here checked it off as a huge
success.
But even this record-smashing

sively powerful, but lacked an offen
sive thrust, and consequently did not
win games.
The U.S.F. game in San Francisco
next week will draw, if present in
dications are any criterion. It will
draw a larger throng than any Don-
Card tilt ever has before.
The Dons beat Oregon State al
most as badly as did Stanford, and
they barely lost to Santa Clara in
a gam" similar to the Indian battle
with the Broncos. And to top that
off the fans remember one of the
most exciting and unusual games
of the 1933 program as that be
tween Stanford and San Francisco
University.
STANI ORD-TROY
CLASH A NATURAL
The following week finds U.S.C.
coming to Stanford. Everything
should have gone together to make
this game a complete sell-out. It
may still be a sell-out, but very few '

will be turned away.
In the first place, Stanford's
freshman vow, now being remem
bered by the juniors on Tiny's
squad, was, and is, a distinct draw
ing power. The 1932 frosh swore
they would not lose to Southern
California as long as they were in
college, and so far they haven't.
Secondly, Northern California has
its heart .set on actually seeing Tony
tumble, and it figures Stanford has
the best chance of accomplishing
this.
Then, the game should be a sell
rut just because it involves Stanford
and Southern California in athletic
competition.
But last week, U.S.C. lost, 0 to 19,
to Washington State College. Be
cause of all the factors that will make
the Card-Troy game a success, this
is not figured to stand too much in
the way of a capacity crowd. How
ever, it cannot help making Stanford
a fairly heavy favorite, unless some
thing unforeseen happens in the en
suing fortnight.
This writer, always wary of the
Southerners, particularly when
Stanford is favored, is speaking only
of the Indians' chances on paper
BEFORE the game. U.S.C. may be
as strong against the Cards this year
as ever before, but unless some
thing happens, Thornhill's Redmen
will be betting odds to win, which
might or might not affect the turn
stile.
BIG GAME WILL
STILL BE BIG
And so it goes. Stanford will go
South to meet U.C.L.A., and they
probably will be favored again, par
ticularly after the Bruins' 2(5 to 3
beating at the hands of Oregon.
Washington, too, after a slow start
this year, may be disappointing fi
nancially, unless the Huskies show
some power between now and No
vember 10.
The Big Game will be Big this
year. California is making a lot, of
claims, and two partial crowds will
come out to see them backed up, or
disproved, depending on alliance.
From this early season glance, the
Big Game at Berkeley will draw as
many people as the Memorial Sta
dium will hold.
All of these odds, of course, may
be changed, and some of them prob
ably will. For example, the U.S.C.,
Washington, and U.C.L.A. games will
all bring forth larger attendances
should Stanford lose to Northwest
ern this week end. Or any of those
three teams may blossom forth in
the next few weeks with new-found
power and bring the Cardinal sched
ule back to the gold-mine it looked
like as the season began.
At any rate, because the Indians
gathered themselves a reputation of
strength last year, and because they
have been showing off well so far
this season, the crowds generally will
be bigger than they have been on
the Farm in recent seasons.
GRID EVENTS WILL
KILL ATTENDANCE
Football this year is going fairly
well for Stanford, but it is going very
badly for Stanford from a gate re
ceipt standpoint.
Events of the past two weeks, and
particularly of lust Saturday, will
shatter the Stanford Board of Ath
ictic Control's biggest chance in
many years to clean up on football.
When the schedule was announced
last year, the Indian directors'
jjiouths were watering in anticipa
tion of one of the best years on rec
ord, as four big home games and two
smaller ones were booked. Added to
this was the fact that for 1934, Card
inal potentialities were such as to
draw a capacity crowd to any game.
THINGS ARE NOT
GOING SO WELL
But now, in the midst of the early
season, things aren't going so well.
It all started a little over a week
atfo when Washington made a poor
showing by defeating Idaho with
a scanty 13 to •) score. And it was
climaxed last Saturday as El Tro
jan went down to an ignominious
defeat, the worst, from a score
standpoint, of any suffered by
U.S.C. in four years.
Contributory incidents to the
Board's financial groans were the
defeat of Northwestern by lowa last
week and U.C.L.A.'s trouncing at
the hands of Oregon two weeks ago.
IJRONCOS BEST
DRAWING CARD
Taking it chronologically, Stanford
opened the season against San Jose.
This game, of course, was not fig
ured for a huge income.
Then, with odds practically even,
Stanford met a popular Santa Clara
team on the next week-end. At
tendance records were shattered, and
officials here checked it off as a huge
success.
But even this record-smashing
crowd is somewhat disappointing
now as it is looked back on. It
was scheduled as the first of four
outstanding attractions, and many
of the more empty-pocketed cus
tomers, while admitting that the
game would probably be a thriller,
decided to wait for one of the
other three more traditional coin
hats. In the light of present oc
currences. they are beginning to
wonder if possibly they made a
mistake.
Although the Indians were a draw
ing card, the Oregon State game,
played under perfect climatic con
ditions in Portland, did not pull a
particularly large gathering for two
reasons. In the first place, it was
just the week before the historical
Oregon-Washington tangle, and most
of the pay-money was being saved
for this game. Secondly, Oregon
Slate had been beaten the preced
ing week by San Francisco Univer
sity, and Stanford was favored a bit
too heavily.
WILL WILDCATS
liE DISAPPOINTING?
Next Saturday Tiny Thornhill's
men meet Northwestern here in the I
second of the "naturals" on the home
grounds. But instead of being a
highly ballyhooed intersectionai
clash for supremacy, the game will
find Stanford a heavy favorite as .she
opens against the Wildcats.
That Northwestern, the team that !
held Stanford to a 0 to 0 tie, may
do it again, this writer does not I
deny. But the fact remains that they
will come from an underdog position
if Ihey should score this upset, and
John Public is not in the habit of
paying cash money to see a sure
thing.
Last Saturday the Wildcats lost.

thing unforeseen happens in the en
suing fortnight.
This writer, always wary of the
Southerners, particularly when
Stanford is favored, is speaking only
of the Indians' chances on paper
BEFORE the game. U.S.C. may be
as strong against the Cards this year
as ever before, but unless some
thing happens, Thornhill's Redmen
will be betting odds to win, which
might or might not affect the turn
stile.
BIG GAME WILL
STILL BE BIG
And so it goes. Stanford will go
South to meet U.C.L.A., and they
probably will be favored again, par
ticularly after the Bruins' 2(5 to 3
beating at the hands of Oregon.
Washington, too, after a slow start
this year, may be disappointing fi
nancially, unless the Huskies show
some power between now and No
vember 10.
The Big Game will be Big this
year. California is making a lot, of
claims, and two partial crowds will
come out to see them backed up, or
disproved, depending on alliance.
From this early season glance, the
Big Game at Berkeley will draw as
many people as the Memorial Sta
dium will hold.
All of these odds, of course, may
be changed, and some of them prob
ably will. For example, the U.S.C.,
Washington, and U.C.L.A. games will
all bring forth larger attendances
should Stanford lose to Northwest
ern this week end. Or any of those
three teams may blossom forth in
the next few weeks with new-found
power and bring the Cardinal sched
ule back to the gold-mine it looked
like as the season began.
At any rate, because the Indians
gathered themselves a reputation of
strength last year, and because they
have been showing off well so far
this season, the crowds generally will
be bigger than they have been on
the Farm in recent seasons.
GRID EVENTS WILL
KILL ATTENDANCE
Football this year is going fairly
well for Stanford, but it is going very
badly for Stanford from a gate re
ceipt standpoint.
Events of the past two weeks, and
particularly of lust Saturday, will
shatter the Stanford Board of Ath
ictic Control's biggest chance in
many years to clean up on football.
When the schedule was announced
last year, the Indian directors'
jjiouths were watering in anticipa
tion of one of the best years on rec
ord, as four big home games and two
smaller ones were booked. Added to
this was the fact that for 1934, Card
inal potentialities were such as to
draw a capacity crowd to any game.
THINGS ARE NOT
GOING SO WELL
But now, in the midst of the early
season, things aren't going so well.
It all started a little over a week
atfo when Washington made a poor
showing by defeating Idaho with
a scanty 13 to •) score. And it was
climaxed last Saturday as El Tro
jan went down to an ignominious
defeat, the worst, from a score
standpoint, of any suffered by
U.S.C. in four years.
Contributory incidents to the
Board's financial groans were the
defeat of Northwestern by lowa last
week and U.C.L.A.'s trouncing at
the hands of Oregon two weeks ago.
IJRONCOS BEST
DRAWING CARD
Taking it chronologically, Stanford
opened the season against San Jose.
This game, of course, was not fig
ured for a huge income.
Then, with odds practically even,
Stanford met a popular Santa Clara
team on the next week-end. At
tendance records were shattered, and
officials here checked it off as a huge
success.
But even this record-smashing
crowd is somewhat disappointing
now as it is looked back on. It
was scheduled as the first of four
outstanding attractions, and many
of the more empty-pocketed cus
tomers, while admitting that the
game would probably be a thriller,
decided to wait for one of the
other three more traditional coin
hats. In the light of present oc
currences. they are beginning to
wonder if possibly they made a
mistake.
Although the Indians were a draw
ing card, the Oregon State game,
played under perfect climatic con
ditions in Portland, did not pull a
particularly large gathering for two
reasons. In the first place, it was
just the week before the historical
Oregon-Washington tangle, and most
of the pay-money was being saved
for this game. Secondly, Oregon
Slate had been beaten the preced
ing week by San Francisco Univer
sity, and Stanford was favored a bit
too heavily.
WILL WILDCATS
liE DISAPPOINTING?
Next Saturday Tiny Thornhill's
men meet Northwestern here in the I
second of the "naturals" on the home
grounds. But instead of being a
highly ballyhooed intersectionai
clash for supremacy, the game will
find Stanford a heavy favorite as .she
opens against the Wildcats.
That Northwestern, the team that !
held Stanford to a 0 to 0 tie, may
do it again, this writer does not I
deny. But the fact remains that they
will come from an underdog position
if Ihey should score this upset, and
John Public is not in the habit of
paying cash money to see a sure
thing.
Last Saturday the Wildcats lost.
20 to 7, to lowa, a good, but still i
only second-rate club of the Big Ten.
And last year's Northwestern record
will not do a groat deal towards
building gate receipts on the Farm.
In 1933, with a green team, the Ev
anston group proved to be defen
sively powerful, but lacked an offen
sive thrust, and consequently did not
win games.
The U.S.F. game in San Francisco
next week will draw, if present in
dications are any criterion. It will
draw a larger throng than any Don-
Card tilt ever has before.
The Dons beat Oregon State al
most as badly as did Stanford, and
they barely lost to Santa Clara in
a gam" similar to the Indian battle
with the Broncos. And to top that
off the fans remember one of the
most exciting and unusual games
of the 1933 program as that be
tween Stanford and San Francisco
University.
STANI ORD-TROY
CLASH A NATURAL
The following week finds U.S.C.
coming to Stanford. Everything
should have gone together to make
this game a complete sell-out. It
may still be a sell-out, but very few '

will be turned away.
In the first place, Stanford's
freshman vow, now being remem
bered by the juniors on Tiny's
squad, was, and is, a distinct draw
ing power. The 1932 frosh swore
they would not lose to Southern
California as long as they were in
college, and so far they haven't.
Secondly, Northern California has
its heart .set on actually seeing Tony
tumble, and it figures Stanford has
the best chance of accomplishing
this.
Then, the game should be a sell
rut just because it involves Stanford
and Southern California in athletic
competition.
But last week, U.S.C. lost, 0 to 19,
to Washington State College. Be
cause of all the factors that will make
the Card-Troy game a success, this
is not figured to stand too much in
the way of a capacity crowd. How
ever, it cannot help making Stanford
a fairly heavy favorite, unless some
thing unforeseen happens in the en
suing fortnight.
