# ALL PLAYERS O.K. AS INDIANS READY FOR WILDCAT TILT
## Cards Prepare To Take Game in Stride 
### 
Oregon State is passed. North
western is next.
In this manner, Coach Tiny Thorn
hill checked off just one more foot
ball game as he started preparations
for another in his 1934 campaign of
take 'em as they come.
The Oregon game was not costly,
from the standpoint of physical con
dition, and a full squad turned out
for a limbering up practice yesterday
afternoon, as the Wildcats from Ev
anston were preparing to board a
train in Chicago, San Francisco-bent
last night.
Northwestern Arrives
The Northwestern eleven, headed
by Dick Hanley, will arrive in San
Francisco Thursday morning, and
will set up headquarters at the Wil
liam Taylor hotel. The Wildcats
probably will work out at Kezar
Stadium in the city Thursday, and
may come to the Farm Friday to try
the Cardinal turf before one of the
first major intersectionai combats of
the year on Saturday.
Full Stanford strength will be on
hand to greet the invasion from the
Mid-west. All the cripples, including
Alf Brandin, Wes Muller, Bones!
Hamilton, Bobby Grayson, and Bob I
Reynolds, will be back and ready to j
go.
Brandin Still Out
Brandin, the only one on this list
who did not play last week, is re
covering from a sinus infection and
cold.
