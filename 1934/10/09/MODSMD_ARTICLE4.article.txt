performance of Max Reinhardt's
spectacular production of "A Mid

Miss de Witt played the role of

cast, she has been alternate for the
part, with Francesca Braggiotti.
Garry Moore, another well-known
San Franciscan, is appearing in the
role of "Bottom," replacing Tom
Moore, who was recalled to Holly
