# Frosh Build Fast Plays
## 
### 
Running plays received attention
during frosh football practice last
night as Coach Jimmy Bradshaw
worked over a few of the rough
spots that showed up during the
Babes' 27-0 win Saturday over Menlo
Junior College Saturday. This week's
contest for the Frosh will be against
the San Jose State Frosh, an un
known quantity at present.
One more was added to the Frosh
hospital list as Ed Gillette, half, re
ported to practice on crutches, num
bering among his of the
Menlo game an injured knee cap and
a broken thumb. It is expected that
Gillette will be ready for the U.S.C.
frosh gamÂ£ two weeks from Satur
day, as will the other two injured
players, Don Gregory, guard, out
with a broken collar bone, and Grant
Stone, whose nose was broken in
practice last week.
Besides considering their own mis
takes of the Menlo win the Frosh
could look forward to their annual
little big game with the California
frosh in view of the unexpected and
decisive 33-0 victory of the U.C.
yearlings over the San Mateo frosh.
The beef element in the Cal Cubs
seems to be more prominent than
ever and the five touchdowns scored
in the San Mateo game shows that
the Cal frosh have an offense that
scores touchdowns. Even with all
their material, the Berkeley Babes
count upon the jinx over the Stan
ford frosh which their coach, Clint
Evans, seems to possess, having
never been beaten by a Card frosh
eleven, even by the great 1932 .squad.
