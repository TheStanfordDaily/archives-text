# WATER POLOISTS ROUND INTO FORM FOR FIRST TILTS
## To Meet Oakland Paddlers Next Week; U.C.L.A. Game Follows 
### 
Rounding into good condition for
next week's opening games, Coach
Nort Thornton's varsity water polo
squad works out on fundamentals
and scrimmage for over an hour
daily. Learning a good basis of play
i occupies the first 20 minutes, fol
lowed by 'strenuous practice under
; game conditions for about 45 min
-1 utes.
Only a week from tomorrow Stan
ford will face the strong Lakeside
Swimming Club team of Oakland in
i the season's first battle. The trans
! bay paddlers will bring enough of a
i threat to Encina pools to prepare the
i Indians for the U.C.L.A. game two
' days later.
Change Style
Since 1932 Stanford has featured
the Hungarian offensive style, with
fast breaking and short passing.
1 This year, however, the Card aqua
tic stars are combining this system
with the American method of play,
which involves longer passes.
Captain Leo Cook, former goalie
who stands 6 feet 4 inches in height
and weighs 227 pounds, is playing
better than ever in his new forward
position. Playing directly in front
of the goal, he needs two men to
guard him, as the six other men on
the team all feed him.
Alternate Styles
Alternating this long, sweeping at
tack with the sudden, short-passing
Hungarian style, the Cardinal water
poloists should be highly successful
j in confusing the opposition this year.
From almost anywhex*e in the pool,
Vlad "Bomber" Taranik shoots long
goals with uncanny skill.
Bob Foster, patrolling the tank's
center, is the squad's best defensive
forward, and also a steady and de
pendable feeder, and Bill Clemo, re
serve forward, works well with Cook
and Taranik. Wally Wiget, playing,
center back, leads the guards, as he
is a good dribbler on offense and a
j defensive stone wall. Jimmy Benet
is always in motion and never seems
to tire, although he dribbles and
1 breaks away with lightning speed,
j Benet previously played forward,
| and shines mostly on offense.
Haslacher Good
Bob Haslacher, regular goal guard,
I has been playing consistently well
i and at times sensationally, although
only a sophomore. His play has con
vinced Coach Thornton that the lat
ter made a wise move in shifting
. Captain Cook to forward.
The Lakeside Club will engage the
Indians at 8 o'clock on Wednesday,
October 17. in a night game, and the
Uclans will meet Stanford on the
afternoon of Friday, October 19.
Since the southerners compose one
of the league's best outfits, Stan
ford's paddlers will probably work
I out still harder in scrimmages for
the next week.
More than a bale of cotton an
acre was harvested this season from
some unirrigated fields in the lower
Rio Grande valley of Texas.
