# Chappie Out On Thursday
## Editor Installs Cereal Dept. Sells Cream of Wit 
### 
"The cream of campus wit and
humor: the Stanford Chaparral," said
Old Boy Gordy Steedman, "will ap
pear early Thursday morning."
"Is it pasteurized cream or raw
cream," asked the little girl in the
back row.
"Well, it may be raw, and again it
may not. All I say is that all.those
desirous of getting these finely
bound first editions should be on
hand, before the supply, and the
salesgirls, are exhausted," whipped
back the Venerable Cuckoo.
There is a new page layout in
Chappie for "the first issue that will
"lay 'em out" cold, according to
Steedman. Combined with it will be
the wonders of the new photolitho
graph cover on the traveling sales
man, the intellectual and unintel
ligible wanderings of Jim Copp in an
"advice column" on the facts of life,
the details of a new course in cig
arette bumming, a poignant and
pungent cartoon on what the well
dressd Stanford mart will wear, a
story on "Farm Relief for the Stan
ford Farm" by Irvin and
the wild ravings of such Chappie
favorites as Ann Ritchie, Winstead
Weaver, and Dink Dawson, and the
contortions of such well-known art
ists as Link Malmquist, Dorman
Smith, and John Coulthard.
Meeting tonight in order to get
the bigger and better issue out for
Thursday morning will be many
salesgirls and business tryoutees at
7:30 o'clock in the Chappie offices,
second floor of the Press building.
"Good-looking girls are especially
wanted," remarked Gordon Steed
man and Everett Claiborne, business
manager, in unison.
