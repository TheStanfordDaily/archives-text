# FISHER TALKS ON COMMUNISM
## KGO Talk Traces Spread Of Soviet Doctrines 
### 
Professor Harold Henry Fisher of
the history department traced the
beginnings of communism in Amer
ica to the 17th century, in his KGO
Stanford University radio talk last
night at 7:45 on "Communism —
It's Objectives and Tactics."
The communistic order, embracing
common ownership of property and
ranging from celibacy to complex
marriage systems, was adopted partly
for practical reasons and partly to
preserve equality between men and
women, by the small Christian sects
who settled in the wilderness to es
cape persecution in Europe.
Early Failures Told
In the 19th century such expensive
failures as the Brook Farm experi
ment and the Icarian communities
of the Middle West were inspired by
European Utopians who kindled dis
approval of the existing social order
among certain groups in America.
The objective of these early Com
munists in America was an eventual
communistic order throughout the
world, but through the peaceful per
suasion and force of their example,
not through political revolution.
Object: Revolution
The objective of the contempo
rary Communists, stated Professor
Fisher, is to replace the present com
petitive system, based on private
profit, by a co-operative society in
which classes are abolished as a re
sult of the common ownership of the
means of production and distribu
tion. This cannot be accomplished
by example and persuasion, how
ever, but by the organization of the
workers to overthrow the existing
social and political order by force.
Marx's belief that the historic mis
sion of Communism would be facili
tated by the speedy crumbling of the
capitalist system has, despite depres
sion and war, not been fulfilled with
in the century following his proph
ecy.
Even today, Professor Fisher be
lieves that they are a long way from
capturing the leadership of the labor
movement in America, and that for
their party to attempt an uprising
similar to the several strikes which
have been attributed to them recent
ly would be a quick way to commit
suicide with its present negligible
following.
Communism Un-American
Because in its tactics Communism
runs counter to American life, Fisher
believes that it remains an alterna
tive to desperation only, in spite of
the fact that its ideals represent a
way of life that has appealed to cer
tain minds of every age, and espe
cially in times of trouble. In France,
Sweden, Denmark, Germany, Great
Britain, and Italy statistics show that
the membership and voting strength
of the Communist party today is in
no greater percentage than in Amer
ica.
Professor Fisher believes that the
immediate significance of Commun*-
ism is in the fact that in Russia, in
1917, a small group of Marxian fol
lowers was able to seize control of
the government. While the degree of
its success or failure is a matter of
debate, so long as it endures it pre
sents more than an academic alter
native to the capitalistic system.

the history department traced the
beginnings of communism in Amer
ica to the 17th century, in his KGO
Stanford University radio talk last
night at 7:45 on "Communism —
It's Objectives and Tactics."
The communistic order, embracing
common ownership of property and
ranging from celibacy to complex
marriage systems, was adopted partly
for practical reasons and partly to
preserve equality between men and
women, by the small Christian sects
who settled in the wilderness to es
cape persecution in Europe.
Early Failures Told
In the 19th century such expensive
failures as the Brook Farm experi
ment and the Icarian communities
of the Middle West were inspired by
European Utopians who kindled dis
approval of the existing social order
among certain groups in America.
The objective of these early Com
munists in America was an eventual
communistic order throughout the
world, but through the peaceful per
suasion and force of their example,
not through political revolution.
Object: Revolution
The objective of the contempo
rary Communists, stated Professor
Fisher, is to replace the present com
petitive system, based on private
profit, by a co-operative society in
which classes are abolished as a re
sult of the common ownership of the
means of production and distribu
tion. This cannot be accomplished
by example and persuasion, how
ever, but by the organization of the
workers to overthrow the existing
social and political order by force.
Marx's belief that the historic mis
sion of Communism would be facili
tated by the speedy crumbling of the
capitalist system has, despite depres
sion and war, not been fulfilled with
in the century following his proph
ecy.
Even today, Professor Fisher be
lieves that they are a long way from
capturing the leadership of the labor
movement in America, and that for
their party to attempt an uprising
similar to the several strikes which
have been attributed to them recent
ly would be a quick way to commit
suicide with its present negligible
following.
Communism Un-American
Because in its tactics Communism
runs counter to American life, Fisher
believes that it remains an alterna
tive to desperation only, in spite of
the fact that its ideals represent a
way of life that has appealed to cer
tain minds of every age, and espe
cially in times of trouble. In France,
Sweden, Denmark, Germany, Great
Britain, and Italy statistics show that
the membership and voting strength
of the Communist party today is in
no greater percentage than in Amer
ica.
Professor Fisher believes that the
immediate significance of Commun*-
ism is in the fact that in Russia, in
1917, a small group of Marxian fol
lowers was able to seize control of
the government. While the degree of
its success or failure is a matter of
debate, so long as it endures it pre
sents more than an academic alter
native to the capitalistic system.
