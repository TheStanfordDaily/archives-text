in school undefeated in the mud
fight, the frosh vehemently started
organization for the traditional battle
in the slush, scheduled for Thursday
at 3:15 o'clock on the frosh football
field.
Captaincy of the freshman forces
was divided between Jack Loupe and
Bill Hanna.
At the rally, called by Johnny Mot
tram, who with Sam Bradshaw and
Bob Church will direct the mud
battle, the frosh planned to muster

the other Encina sponsors will deco
rate the mud slingers with marks of
green paint, to distinguish them
from the sophomores.
The battle will last 30 minutes, at
the end of which time the five judges
will come to a rapid decision on the
basis of the numbers found in the
roped-ofT sections near each mud
