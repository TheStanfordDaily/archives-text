## Record Shut-out in Fourth Wins for Cardinals' Pitching Brothers SERIES COUNT 4 TO 3 Riot by Fans in Sixth Halts Game 17 Minutes 
### 
DETROIT, Oct. 9 (/P). —Completing
the spectacular saga of the Deans
with a history-making climax, the
great Jerome Herman "Dizzy" Dean
pitched St. Louis to the baseball
championship of the world today
with a record shut-out triumph, 11
to 0, as the Cardinal clouting crew
•slaughtered the pitching staff of the
Detroit Tigers in as wild and riot
ous a finish as any world series has
ever witnessed.
The National League champions
blasted the defense of Mickey Coch
rane's battered Bengals with a
smashing seven-run attack in the
third. They bombarded six pitchers
all told for a total of 17 hits, while
Dizzy Dean, turning in the fourth
victory for his team and family,
emerged from the seventh and final
game with the most lopsided series
shut-out margin in history.
ewson blanked the Athletics, 9 to 0,
in 1905.
Fans Start Kiot
Before the clouting Cardinals
dashed off the field with the final
decision, four games to three, and
their third world championship in
nine years, they survived a riot
ous outburst by the left field
bleacher fans, who let loose a bar
rage of missiles, aimed at Joe Med
wick, interrupting the game for 17
minutes and subsiding only after
the St. Louis left fielder and
clean-up clouter was removed
from the game, mainly for safety's
sake, by Baseball Commissioner
Kencsaw Mountain Landis.
The demonstration, one of the
worst in series history, was prompted
by a run-in at third base in the
Cardinal half of the sixth, when
Medwick slid into the bag after a
booming triple to right and ex
changed kicks with Marvin Owen,
Tiger infielder. Medwick's return to
his position was a signal for a wild
outbreak by the thousands packed in
the temporary open stands off left
field.
Dean Control Good
Dean allowed but six hits, walked
none, and allowed two hits in a
single inning only in the fifth and
ninth.
He struck out five, one in each
of those innings when he needed
it most, fanned big Hank Green
berg three times, and wound up
the series as he started it, with a
victory.
Jim Collins, Card first baseman,
led the wholesale attack with four
safe belts, and Dean, with two,
started the third inning rally with a
double.
Four See Action
Before that session ended, four!
pitchers had seen action, 13 men
batted, there were seven hits, three
of them doubles, three men walked,
and the bases three times were filled.
Schoolboy Rowe, beaten yesterday ;
by young Paul Dean, who with Dizzy
accounted for all four of the Card- j
inal victories, lasted only through ,
one out. Hogsett got no one out, j
and Bridges, facing the last man,
Jack Rothrock, made him hit into
a force play.
Errors by Goose Goslin in the sixth
and Charlie Gehringer in the seventh
led to the last two Cardinal two-run
rallies. Medwick tripled, Collins and
Bill Delancey singled in the sixth,
while Leo Durocher tripled and
Rothrock doubled in the eighth.
