# Glory of Nome Wiped Out in Flames As Conflagration Razes Mining Town
## 
### Louise Harlan 
Nome! It sounds glamorous, does
n't it? It isn't, and wasn't even be
fore a spark set fire to the town's
main hotel and laid flat all but a
small section of the entire place. It
was a dirty little town, built of old
wooden buildings which were noth
ing more than fire traps, and the
town extended along the beach of
the Bering Sea for about a mile.
At one end of the town was King
Island Village, inhabited by a tribe
of Eskimos from an island 75 miles
from Nome every summer, and at
the other end the sandpit, where
Eskimos from Diomede Island lived.
These sections of town, the dirtiest
and most run-down of all, are still
standing.
Until September 17, Nome was
merely a small mining town, fast j
declining in importance and due for j
a natural death in about ten years, j
Then a spark from a nearby building
set fire to the Golden Gate Hotel, in !
the center of town, and Nome burned
to the ground and gained itself a lot
of momentary- front-page glory.
The fire department, consisting of
a few pieces of ancient but well
meaning apparatus and several fire
men, rushed to the scene of the blaze !
but unfortunately the wagons were ;
placed in front of the hotel and were
burned down before the fire was hi

, half hour old.
Because the buildings were set
j close together, an unusually dry
i summer had made them nothing but
; tinder. That fact, coupled with a
| strong wind, proved the undoing of
i the town. The merchants and home
| owners of Nome could do nothing
but stand and watch their stores and
houses become ashes.
The postoffice, courthouse, Coast
Guard station and other govern
ment buildings were near the Golden
Gate and were among the first to
go. The one business section of
town, Front Street, was in the direct
path of the fire, and was razed to
the ground also.
Realizing that it was the only pos
sible method of Stopping the fire,
desperate citizens dynamited away
several buildings, thus creating a
gap which the fire could not jump.
Glory Past
Nome has had its final blaze of
glory. Despite the fact that it. is the |
center of one of Alaska's four divi
sions, corresponding to counties in 1
the States, it will never again regain
the size of the gold rush days, and
will probably never again be even as
large as it was before the fire, when
there were about 500 white people
there and numerous half-breeds and
Eskimos.
Ambitious and chamber-of-com

merce minded merchants and citizens
would like to .see the town rebuilt out
of the ashes. Some new buildings
will be erected; that is inevitable.
But Nome's Doom, with a capital
"D,' has been spelled.
Facilities Limited
For a great many people will have
to leave for the winter, since there
will be no housing facilities for
them. The freeze-up is upon the
town, and the time during which
foundations can be laid this fall is
limited. And most of those people,
arriving in the Stales, where they
can live reasonably and perhaps find
jobs to support them and their fam
ilies, will not return. The exception
to that rule lies in those with gold
fever in their blood.
They will return and take to the
hills with their supply of beans, J
known as "Alaska strawberries," i
their packs on their hacks and mo
squito netting over their withered |
faces, always searching for gold. But I
the sourdough will not rebuild the '
town, and can contribute little to its I
support. And so the Eskimos and
half-breeds will take possession and !
Nome will soon be a thing of the I
past.

Nome this summer, but escaped the
(ire which razed the town.)
