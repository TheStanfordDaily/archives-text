# Local Men Think War Is Possible
## Three Faculty Members Comment on Crisis 
### 
The assassination of King Alexan
der of Yugoslavia will undoubtedly
accentuate the European crisis to
such a point that violence of .some
sort, even perhaps to the proportion
of war, will result, three Stanford
faculty men, active in the study of
European affairs, believe.
Harold Henry Fisher, lecturer in
history, believes the assassination is
reflection of the activity of the
Croatian factor against the central
government which has been set up
by the Serbian part of the Yugo
slavian state.
"The assassin was apparently a
Croatian," Fisher said. "His act
was probably a result of Croatian
influence and may shake the au
thority of the central government
and start trouble between the
Croatians and the Serbs."
Significant in connection with
Fisher's interpretation is the state
ment of the Croatian leader in
Vienna yesterday saying that disor
ders culminating in civil war in
Yugoslavia may result from the as
sassination of King Alexander.
Dr. Ralph Haswell Lutz, professor
of history, expressed the opinion that
the assassination will create a very
serious situation in Europe and that
it will affect the Little Entente.
"If the assassin was a Croatian."
he stated, "the result is likely to
amount to a regency which in turn
will amount to a dictatorship in
Belgrade."
Hugh McDowall Clokie, assistant
professor of political science, recalls
that it was just such a thing as this
assassination that precipitated the
Great War 20 years ago.
"I cannot say it is probable,"
Clokie said, "but it is certainly
possible that this act, coming right
after the killing of Chancellor
Dollfuss, may cause serious reper
cussions that will result in war."
All three men believe that further
reports within the next few days will
definitely indicate just what results
in the European situation the assas
sination will bring.
