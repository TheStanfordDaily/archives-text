# NAMES APPARENT AIRPLANE LIMITS
## Durand Discusses Distance, Speed, and Altitude 
### 
Limiting his discussion to facts'
and resources now available to
aeronautical science, Dr. W. F. Du
rand, emeritus professor of mechan- :
ical engineering, lectured on "The |
Apparent Present Day Limitations of
Airplane Performance" last night in
the Little Theater.
After stressing the words "appar- ;
ent" and "present day" in his title,!
Dr. Durand took up successively the j
four factors of speed, distance, time, I
and height in airplane performance, j
By the extreme utilization of all
that we now have and know of aero
nautical theory, Dr. Durand said,
our present speed record of 424 miles
can be raised to 500.
The present long distance Hying
record of 5,676 miles, made in Au- j
gust, 1933, might be improved to.
7800 miles. Even 10.000 miles with- !
out stopping for fuel is considered :
within the range of possibility.
As to the question of how long it J
is possible to stay in the air, Dr. j
Durand believes that an endurance i
record of 150 hours, as compared I
with the present record of 84 hours, j
is mathematically possible. This as
sumes that the human factor func- |
tions perfectly.
An altitude record of 65,000 feet is \
considered possible.
