SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. I) </!*) —
The San Francisco Chronicle for
mally denied today it had been in !
contempt of the California Supreme
! Court when it printed September 10 !
I an article saying the court had do- •
| cided to give David A. Lamson a;
new trial.
Chester H. Rowell, editor, and j
I W. D. Chandler, managing editor, i
| admitted responsibility for the pub- |
| lication, but declared it was pub- !
i li.shed in good faith and rested upon j
! belief in its truth. The answers also
| denied the information in the article
j came from any Supreme Court Jus
tice or officer, or that its publication
was intended to reflect upon the
court's integrity or interfere with
the administration of justice.
At the close of an hour and a half
hearing, during which the justices
i tried ineffectively to learn the source
of the information the Chronicle had ,
I published, the newspaper's attor- >
5 neys wore given one more day lo]
• file points and authorities, after!
j which it was said the case would be j
I taken under advisement. Mean- j
| while, there will be no decision on
' Lamson's trial.
