# Election for Council Men Is Postponed
## Ex Committee Grants Requested Dates 
### 
Postponing measures, tabling
many others, delaying actions, ap
pointing committees to investigate,
Ex Committee met for two hours in
the Old Union last night, and decided
definitely on several uncontested
matters: the delaying of the A.S.S.U.
election to fill vacancies in Men's
Council—scheduled for next Thurs
day—until the 25th of this month, the
making of several minor appoint
ments, and the granting of many re
quests for dates on the campus cal
endar.
A much-debated question: wheth
er Ram's Head should be allowed a
place with Sword and Sandals, and
Masquers on the Dramatic Council,
increasing the number of that body
to 10, was relegated to a committee
consisting of Bill Rogers, chairman;
A1 Blackmail, and Woody Adams to
sound the opinions of the Council on
the matter and report their findings
to the Ex Committee.
Suggests Change
President Marvin Kahn's sugges
tion that an amendment be added to
the constitution allowing the presi
dent to declare a closed meeting of
Ex Committee at his discretion was
tabled.
John Brock was appointed
A.S.S.U. election chairman. Mir
iam Kropp was appointed chair
man pro tem of the Stanford Card
inals. The awards recommended
by Rally Committee and Women's
Committee with superimposed axe
to wear on sweater, for both with
identifying red cap for Rally
Committee.
The proposal to include all student
musical activities into a Music Coun
cil was submitted to a committee
headed by Mort D'Evelyn, and com
posed of Barbara Holmes, Vivian
Kay, Sam Lee, Art Allen, Norman
Barnes, and Ben Cave.
An error in the printing of the new
constitution was corrected by making
the salary of the Dramatic Council
Manager $50 a production instead of
$35 a month.
Recommendations by the Stan
ford Cardinals for further mem
bers were approved as: Bob
Church, Pete Peck, seniors: Bob
Jones, Rupert Prohme, juniors.
Minutes were accepted from Pub
lications Council, Rally Committee,
and Dramatic ouncil. An Interna
tional Committee, composed of the
International Rouhd-table, the Chi
nese, and Japanese Clubs was rec
ognized as a student activity.
Dates Granted
Among the many dates granted last
night were the ones for tonight's
Lagunita - Union jolly-up, and
Thursday's Freshman - Sophomore
mud-fight.
At 9:30 the subject of appointing a
permanent secretary came up. Said
Helen Ray: "I move we table the mo
lion. We have already met for two
hours and we cannot hold an in
telligent discussion on it."
The meeting was adjourned.
