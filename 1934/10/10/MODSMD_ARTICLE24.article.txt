# Why Walk?

SulTicient complaint has arisen of late to
compel a few words on the Palv-Slanford free
commutation system. The roughs all say, "It
ain't what it used to be." We have faint sus
picious that this pernicious stale of affairs
may be laid at the door of the many new
comers, to whom the practice may nol have
been properly explained.
Alors, then. If you are in Paly and desire
a ride to the campus, simply stand at the bus
slop near the railroad gales on University
Avenue. If you are on the Quad and desire a
ride to Paly, the best place is at the intersec
tion of Sena and Lasuen near the English
corner.
And, if you drive a car, courtesy and custom
require that you stop when possible and give
'em a lift. And common decency requires that
if you stop at all you extend the courtesy due
a fellow-rough and gentleman to the rider.
And the reverse is just as true.
Also, a last word. The thumb, as in soup, is
superfluous. It is considered by the old hands
as unnecessary to resort to thumbing gestures
as it is inconsiderate lo fail t<> stop.
