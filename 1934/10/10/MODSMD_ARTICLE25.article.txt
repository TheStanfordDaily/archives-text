# Danger Ahead

lii a potentially stronger position than it
lias held for years, the American Federation
of Labor is now meeting in San Francisco,
intent upon formulating plans and policies
for what will probably he the most critical
year in its history.
In Sail Francisco, scene of one of the bit
terest and most fruitless capital-labor strug
gles of tin' year, American unionism is chart
ing a course that must carry it safely through
the dangers of excessive radicalism and hostile
public opinion on the one hand and domina
tion of the employers upon the other.
Few hut the most reactionary challenge
labor's right to organize. Fven Sail Francisco,
despite last summer's unpleasant experience,
still recognizes this fact. That right, however,
carries with it, like the privileges of capital,
certain responsibilities. Capital has undoubt
edly abused many of its privileges and it
behooves labor not to follow a similar course.
It must he remembered that there is a large
body of the public that is not particularly
concerned with either side of the controversy.
However justified a long and bloody strike
may be in the eyes of labor, the general public
is interested only in its own welfare and is
apt to resent anything that disturbs ils "nor
mal" status, whatever the merits of the case.
The threatened rift between radical and
conservative elements in the Federation can
be patched lip. Intelligent leadership can tri
umph, both for the sake of organized labor
and for the sake of the innocent and long
sull'ering public.
