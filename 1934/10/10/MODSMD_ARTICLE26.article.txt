# Co-operation, Called "Co-op"

### 
History of Stanford's student - instituted
(a)-<)|> lakes one hack over a long period of
hoc lie and experimental stages of develop
ment. The original organization started oil'
with :i hang, and all eating group managers
pledged themselves*to give the new idea and
its enormous haying power a fair try, with a
resultant saving of all-imporlant dollars for
I heinselves.
Alter a year or so, new managers came
along, student leadership passed from the
hands of students, and people began to forget
about the Co-op, and then, willi over a third
of purchases being made outside of the or
ganization, the buying power shrunk propor-
I ionatclv.
Last nighl, student leadership again ap
peared in the foreground. Managers of the
eating groups, with few exceptions, met in a
body, agreed to make ;ill purchases through
the group, and credit for this temporary and
apparently successful measure goes to Gordon
Mallatralt, president of the ID.'H 3.") outfit.
A word to the individual manager; A pledge
has been signed by yourself to make all your
purchases through the Stanford co-op. There
is only one possible manner in which the
'Go-op can operate to i/our own best advantage
and save your eating group a maximum of
money willi the best of quality in goods con
sumed.
Thai agreement must be kept.
