## SECRETARY OF STATE HULL 
### BOBN JONES 
Tall, studious, white-haired, impressive—the Hon
orable Cordell Hull. Secretary of State, is one of the
few members of Roosevelt's cabinet who seems to gain
the utmost respect and affection from every man.
Honest, sincere, and conservative, he appears as a man
I of tremendous personal and intellectual dignity.
Because the nation's chiefs are wrangling with do
; mestic and internal affairs, Mr. Hull's department seems
I to have been slighted in the present political set-up.
j The (»2-year-old Tennesseean, an avowed internation
alist, is an idealist who doesn't lit so well into the "New
Deal" picture. He probably would have been more at
I home in the more conservative Hoover layout.
i From my chat with him in his office, on Ihe .second
I floor of the comparatively antiquated wooden State
j building to the side of the White House, I gained con
! fidence in him and in his measures and dealings with
foreign nations.
With the blinds shutting out most of the hot sum
mer sun sizzling Washington, I sat in his spacious,
| cool office, listening to his words of wisdom on govern
ment and journalism. The manner in which he spoke
i placed me perfectly at ease. He impressed me as having
j the possibility of making a wonderful president oi
i some university.
His white hair and his light linen suit added infor
! mality to the cool atmosphere and to my ease, and
; made "Mr. Secretary" a man of striking appearance.
In that room had sat John Hay, Elihu Root, William
Jennings Bryan, Charles Evans Hughes, and Frank B.
i Kellogg, those noted statesmen. Hay, private secretary
| to Lincoln, had served under McKinley and Roosevelt
; during that critical period in foreign affairs. Root won
j recognition for his leadership in the peace movement as
j did Kellogg. The room carried a romantic and his
i torical air. Strained diplomatic relations, those of the
) hectic War days, along with everyday peaceful rela
| tions, had been studied and smoothed in that white
| walled room. History had been made there.
Mr. Hull cited the need for thoroughness in dis
cussing modern-day problems, especially in newspaper
j commentating.
"Study a problem exhaustively," he stressed. "Get
: to the basic and fundamental facts of that problem or
j situation. Find out the exact reason for the outcome
of the events arising from he original set of eircum
! stances. To be able to predict or even foresee the
! possible outcome, get to the bottom of th situation.
Once or twice his .secretary entered the room from
I the office to present some immediate problem of state.
After I had used up about 15 or 20 minutes of the
government's valuable time chatting with Mr. Hull
while the world at large was expecting a war in almost
any of the trouble zones, I left the Secretary to his
work and his paper-piled desk.
Will Irwin, Stanford man, is "on the carpet" to
j morrow.

Tall, studious, white-haired, impressive—the Hon
orable Cordell Hull. Secretary of State, is one of the
few members of Roosevelt's cabinet who seems to gain
the utmost respect and affection from every man.
Honest, sincere, and conservative, he appears as a man
I of tremendous personal and intellectual dignity.
Because the nation's chiefs are wrangling with do
; mestic and internal affairs, Mr. Hull's department seems
I to have been slighted in the present political set-up.
j The (»2-year-old Tennesseean, an avowed internation
alist, is an idealist who doesn't lit so well into the "New
Deal" picture. He probably would have been more at
I home in the more conservative Hoover layout.
i From my chat with him in his office, on Ihe .second
I floor of the comparatively antiquated wooden State
j building to the side of the White House, I gained con
! fidence in him and in his measures and dealings with
foreign nations.
With the blinds shutting out most of the hot sum
mer sun sizzling Washington, I sat in his spacious,
| cool office, listening to his words of wisdom on govern
ment and journalism. The manner in which he spoke
i placed me perfectly at ease. He impressed me as having
j the possibility of making a wonderful president oi
i some university.
His white hair and his light linen suit added infor
! mality to the cool atmosphere and to my ease, and
; made "Mr. Secretary" a man of striking appearance.
In that room had sat John Hay, Elihu Root, William
Jennings Bryan, Charles Evans Hughes, and Frank B.
i Kellogg, those noted statesmen. Hay, private secretary
| to Lincoln, had served under McKinley and Roosevelt
; during that critical period in foreign affairs. Root won
j recognition for his leadership in the peace movement as
j did Kellogg. The room carried a romantic and his
i torical air. Strained diplomatic relations, those of the
) hectic War days, along with everyday peaceful rela
| tions, had been studied and smoothed in that white
| walled room. History had been made there.
Mr. Hull cited the need for thoroughness in dis
cussing modern-day problems, especially in newspaper
j commentating.
"Study a problem exhaustively," he stressed. "Get
: to the basic and fundamental facts of that problem or
j situation. Find out the exact reason for the outcome
of the events arising from he original set of eircum
! stances. To be able to predict or even foresee the
! possible outcome, get to the bottom of th situation.
Once or twice his .secretary entered the room from
I the office to present some immediate problem of state.
After I had used up about 15 or 20 minutes of the
government's valuable time chatting with Mr. Hull
while the world at large was expecting a war in almost
any of the trouble zones, I left the Secretary to his
work and his paper-piled desk.
Will Irwin, Stanford man, is "on the carpet" to
j morrow.
