# VIEWING THE NEWS
## WITH CHILTON R. BUSH 
### CHARLOTTE BURRIDGE 
Naval treaties, armament plans, disarmament con
ferences—lots of thinking, more talking, and very little
accomplished, but they still go on. The next one is
scheduled for early 1935 so that each nation's favorite
orator may have a chance to give his song and dance
before the present treatiss expire at the end of 1935.
It may be that by 1935 there will be no reason for
a conference since all negotiations seem to go on before
the international meeting. In 1928 Hoover called a
naval confab. It wa.s not planned ahead of time.
Everyone came with a different set of ideas, refused
to agreed, and the whole thing blew up.
Professor Chilton K. Bush, new head of the Division
of Journalism and an interested observer of world
affairs, comments on the situation with none too hope
ful an attitude. Formerly associate professor of jour
nalism at the University of Wisconsin and for a num
ber of years an active newspaperman, Bush keeps up
with the day's news and is particularly interested in
international naval afTairs.
"It looks as though the Japanese are going to make
it impossible to agree on a treaty," he began. "They
want a bigger navy."
In 1922 capital ships-and aircraft carriers were lim
ited according to the 5-5-3 ratio for Britain, the United
States, and Japan.
"There was a great deal of politics involved in this
agreement. The Japanese renounced imperialistic
ambitions, and in return the United States agreed not
to fortify Guam and the Philippine Islands. The United
States also consented to scrap battleships and approve
the three ratio for Japan. All of this arrangement was
ba-ed on the nine-power treaty signed by all powers
with Asiatic interest —in which all agreed to respect
the territorial integrity of China."
The question is: Did Japan break the treaty in taking
Manchuria?
"What the 5-5-1? agreement meant was simply that
each nation agreed to remain in its own hack-yard,"
Bush believes. "That ratio was adequate for Japan
versus America, especially when the United States
promised not to fortify the Philippines and fiuam."
At the time of the Washington conference in 1922, an
Anglo-Japanese alliance existed but the British did
not renew it.
"It looks like the British are going to play ball
with the Japanese, now," the professor predicts, "and
although France and Italy have never agreed to a
limitation agreement, for cruisers, il is quite probable
that they have gotten together recently."
The point is—balance in sea power which has existed
since immediately after the war may be upset all around
within the next few months, and lots of possibility
exists that the United States may go back to the 191(1
naval program and decide to have a navy stronger
than that of any other nalion.
"Insofar as Britain is concerned the United States
doesn't need as large a navy as Great Britain unless
the United States decides to convoy its merchant ships
during a war in which Great Britain was n bclliger
enl and the United States a neutral," the journalist
concluded.

the territorial integrity of China."
The question is: Did Japan break the treaty in taking
Manchuria?
"What the 5-5-1? agreement meant was simply that
each nation agreed to remain in its own hack-yard,"
Bush believes. "That ratio was adequate for Japan
versus America, especially when the United States
promised not to fortify the Philippines and fiuam."
At the time of the Washington conference in 1922, an
Anglo-Japanese alliance existed but the British did
not renew it.
"It looks like the British are going to play ball
with the Japanese, now," the professor predicts, "and
although France and Italy have never agreed to a
limitation agreement, for cruisers, il is quite probable
that they have gotten together recently."
The point is—balance in sea power which has existed
since immediately after the war may be upset all around
within the next few months, and lots of possibility
exists that the United States may go back to the 191(1
naval program and decide to have a navy stronger
than that of any other nalion.
"Insofar as Britain is concerned the United States
doesn't need as large a navy as Great Britain unless
the United States decides to convoy its merchant ships
during a war in which Great Britain was n bclliger
enl and the United States a neutral," the journalist
concluded.
Naval treaties, armament plans, disarmament con
ferences—lots of thinking, more talking, and very little
accomplished, but they still go on. The next one is
scheduled for early 1935 so that each nation's favorite
orator may have a chance to give his song and dance
before the present treatiss expire at the end of 1935.
It may be that by 1935 there will be no reason for
a conference since all negotiations seem to go on before
the international meeting. In 1928 Hoover called a
naval confab. It wa.s not planned ahead of time.
Everyone came with a different set of ideas, refused
to agreed, and the whole thing blew up.
Professor Chilton K. Bush, new head of the Division
of Journalism and an interested observer of world
affairs, comments on the situation with none too hope
ful an attitude. Formerly associate professor of jour
nalism at the University of Wisconsin and for a num
ber of years an active newspaperman, Bush keeps up
with the day's news and is particularly interested in
international naval afTairs.
"It looks as though the Japanese are going to make
it impossible to agree on a treaty," he began. "They
want a bigger navy."
In 1922 capital ships-and aircraft carriers were lim
ited according to the 5-5-3 ratio for Britain, the United
States, and Japan.
"There was a great deal of politics involved in this
agreement. The Japanese renounced imperialistic
ambitions, and in return the United States agreed not
to fortify Guam and the Philippine Islands. The United
States also consented to scrap battleships and approve
the three ratio for Japan. All of this arrangement was
ba-ed on the nine-power treaty signed by all powers
with Asiatic interest —in which all agreed to respect
the territorial integrity of China."
