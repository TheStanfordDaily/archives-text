MADRID, Oct. 9 (/P;. â€”Spain's six
day red revolt was a dangerous mass
of embers tonight, flaring into gun
fire here and there as the conserva
tive government of Premier Alejan
dro remained in power and recon
vened Congress.
Tenaciously the Socialist and
Communist rebels held on in North
ern Spain, rallying at Ovido, Astu
rias province, and barricading them
selves against attack in the city's
labor district,
The army was awaiting reinforce
ments before attacking. A column
of troops under General Eduardo j
Lopez Ochoa -was moving into the
mining district, whe re the rebels !
held other strongholds.
Ochoa's forces were reported to j
have encountered centers where ;
lebels had slaughtered entire gar- I
risons of civil guards, including their
wives and families. More than 400
guards were said to have been
killed.
The national death toll was im
possible to count. It was estimated
at from 500 to 1000, wilh thousands
of others wounded and imprisoned.
For intimating in an advertisement :
that there would be a shortage of j
textiles in Germany, Eduard Miegel,
a Berlin tailor, is forbidden to ad
vertise any more.
