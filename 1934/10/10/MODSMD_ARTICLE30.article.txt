## "THE CHALLENGE TO LIBERTY" 
### 
Since March of 1933, New Dealers
' have been "011 the grill." They have
I been faced with the unappetizing di
j lemma of acting—and being roasted
: for their action; or not acting—and
i being broiled for their inaction,
j Having decided that the broilers are
i more numerous than the roasters,
; Franklin Roosevelt and his crew
: have given the country action
j aplenty.
.
The stock Democratic retort to
i journalistic and oratorical matadors,
: has 'been that unusual measures are
necessary to counter-balance the
abuses extant under the blanket of
! Republicanism. But this little paci
j ficr is now almost two years old,
and is beginning to pall on a waiting
j public.
At this point, America's No. 1
Republican and Stanford's No. 1
! alumnus writes a book. It is a small
! book, but packs a heavy punch. It
! is meant, perhaps, to be an exposi
i tion of orthodox American philoso
j phy, but it is regarded by the nation
I as heavy artillery attack on the hosts
I of Democracy. It decries the set
j back to "Liberty" under Commun
' ism, Fascism, and National Regimen
j tat ion. which is Herbert Hoover's
j name for the New Deal. It recog
i nizes abuses prevalent under the
j "Old Deal," and presents remedies
I for these evils jn broad generalities.
! It says that the family is the center
I of American life. It is written for
; mass consumption.
Democrats are glad that Amer
j ica's No. 1 Republican and Stanford's
No. 1 alumnus has written the book.
From their point of view it confirms
all their suspicions of Republicans.
Now they can say: "We told you so."
The year 1936 will soon roll
' around. If the mass of the people
| have jobs, they will care little about
the New Deal's "Challenge to Lib
i erty," especially since they will still
! know freedom of speech, press, and
I religion; and perhaps a little of the
! "liberty" that comes from jobs and
J wages.
If the mass of the people do not
' have jobs, Democrats will point to
j the "Challenge to Liberty" and say:
j "We have more to offer than they
; have. There is more to hope for in
j going forward, than in going back
j ward." And in our humble opinion,

people will listen to the Democrats
or other politicians, as long as Re
publicans offer an abstraction like
"liberty," and nothing more.
When comes real regimentation,
and liberty is really squelched, Mr.
Hoover will then be able to say: "1
told you so." But if the squelching
is very complete, he will only be
able to say it to himself.
