•THE SCARLET EMPRESS"
(Paramount)
A( Blanco's Theater, Mountain View
Has to do with Catharine the
Great's rise to power, with Marlene
Dietrich as the sensuous empress.
The picture, in its attempt to surpass
the Elizabeth Bergnti-, English pro-

duct ion, fills in
with Hollywood
claptrap what it
lack.s in plot, di
alogue, and ac
tion. The result
is a tedious and
boring pageant,
full of bells,

horses, and close-ups of la Dietrich !
against a background of grotesque
gargoyles. Technically, the picture j
is interesting for its unusual, sculp
toresque photography. —Brill.
