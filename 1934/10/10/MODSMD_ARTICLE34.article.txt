WHAT TO DO WITH
UNSOLD TICKETS?
"What are we supposed to do with
unsold looters' tickets to football
games after the student .sale closes?"
For a long time the Board of Ath
letic Control has been puzzling to
find a satisfactory answer to this
question. And particularly is the
Board finding it necessary to choose
it least one alternative for the
Northwestern game tickets.
ll' the seats are to be sold, there
are obviously but two answers:
To keep the sale open to the stu
dent body until the pasteboards
are spoken for; or to throw the
remaining block of seats on pub
lic sale.
Each has its drawbacks.
It is distinctly bad psychology to
resort to the former and keep adding
a day to student sale. If this is done,
the student body becomes used to
having the .sale prolonged, and on
future games it will not take Board
announcements concerning dates ol
ticket sales seriously. Consequently,
although this means is the most cer
tain method of selling out the root
ers' block, the officials balk from it.
ALTERNATIVE IS
ALSO BAD POLICY
Then consider the officials' alter
native of taking the remaining block
of choice 50-yard line rooters' seats
and throwing them on the general
public.
Regular public seats go on sale
as soon as do the rooters' tickets, i
but those regular pasteboards call j
for locations farther from mid- j
field.
John Smith, then, buys his ticket ■
011 the 10-yard line on Monday, and'
if the rooters' tickets are not all sold !
to students, Henry Jones may secure j
liis ticket on the 50-yard line as he j
walks into the game on Saturday, j
Mr. Smith, then, will not like it one ;
little bit, and the officials responsible
''or this may be forced to count him
out of the next game's ticket sales.
So the B.A.C. is left with quite a
weighty problem when students
don't speak for the budgeted num
ber of ducats. —Browne.
