# Polish Stressed for Indian Attack
## GRIDMEN PREPARE FOR FIRST OF FIVE TOUGH OPPONENTS 
### Millard Browne 
Northwestern's Wildcast will fur
j nish the first real indication of just
! what may be expected of Stanford's
HJ34 football campaign Saturday.
Coach Tiny Thornhill and his In
dians must reach the top this week
and they must maintain this posi
tion from Saturday on.
So far, the Cardinals have been
building. They started against Sat
Jose State, hit Santa Clara, anc
smacked Oregon State all on theii
up-grade.
Five Tough Games
But this week-end it will be essen
tial that they reach their peak, be
cause after Northwestern will be
U.S.F., nobody's set-up; and then
comes U.S.C., after which is the
U.C.L.A. game and then Washing
ton. All of these are on successive
Saturdays.
From now on, then, Stanford will
have no time for building, and very
little time for polishing. Practices
after the Northwestern contest will
be merely for the purpose jpf main
taining condition and perfection, be
sides ironing out a few minor kinks
that are bound to crop up. Practice
will correspond to the rehearsals of
a play cast that is going into its 21st
week.
Working Team Hard
So Tiny is working his team, hard;
and has been doing it for the past
two weeks in the attempt to get them
up to that stage of perfection that
will be demanded by Saurday.
The Indian offense must click,
smoothly; timing must be perfect;
defense, and particularly defense
against forward passing, must be
done in an organized manner, and
the condition of individual players
must be such that they could play
all 60 minutes if necessary.
Learn New Plays
If these things are present Sat
urday, Stanford will be ready to
continue with the next four games
with confidence, and if they are
lacking, no matter who wins ihe
Northwestern game, an indication
of what to expect from the Indians
in later games will be forthcoming.
While the Northwestern eleven is
speeding westward from Evanston,
111., by special train, Tiny's co
champion Indians are thinking of the
Wildcats objectively, and preparing
new plays as they add a few deft
touches to the old ones.
Thornhill is planning a more spec
tacular attack for the Cardinals for
the remainder of the year, and is
adding several lateral and forward
pass plays to his team's bag of
tricks.
