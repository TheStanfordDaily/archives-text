# IMPORTANT GRID TILTS ON COAST
## 
### 
While the intersectional flavor of
the Stanford - Northwestern will
make the Palo Alto game the head
liner in Coast football this week,
several important conference battles
are on tap.
Perhaps the results of this Satur
day's battles will be just as disas
trous as those of the preceding week,
although the grid follower can hardly
feature the equal of the decisive de
feat of the mighty Trojans by such
a club as the Pullman eleven.
The Oregon-Washington tilt will
be the important one as far as con
ference standings go, with the
U. C. L. A. - Montana game second.
Both Oregon and Washington are un
defeated, and this "natural" is a
favorite with Portland fans.
For the statistician this Saturday
will supply at least one comparative
score. Alonzo Stagg's Pacific Grid
ders, now famous for holding U.S.C.
to one touchdown several weeks ago,
will meet Cal in the Berkeley Me
morial Stadium. The taste of the St.
Mary's defeat, always a bitter pill, \
should find the Bear in a savage;
mood. The result should be a dis
astrous one for the valiant Pacific
gridders. Cal must come through
this week with something, or else
1934 will be just another one of
those years in which U.C. was a
world-beater before the season !
opened but just never could get'
going.
