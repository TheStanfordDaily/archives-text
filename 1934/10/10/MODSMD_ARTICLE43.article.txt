### Warren Breed 
| If it weren't for the merest sort of
t technicality Stanford would be pos
! sessed of another great miler, per
; haps greater than Chuck Nimmo.
i Norm Bright is the man, and he last
I night ran three laps in 3:12, only a
j week after the beginning of the reg
ular training season. Add one more
lap and he would have a mile in
| the fast time of about 4:25.
Bright, however, for several years
| attended an insignificant normal
! school in Washington, and partici
-1 pated in one meet a year, thus ex
cluding him from further, college
I competition. He is not even eligible
| for cross-country.
Joe Burris, Bill Sorenson, and A1
Blackman ran their first races of the
I season, and showed that they are
I still in workable condition. Burris
j came in a yard ahead of Sorenson
for a 1:31 660. Blackman showed
j heels to Les Hables and the field in
; 352, with a nice 39-second race.
