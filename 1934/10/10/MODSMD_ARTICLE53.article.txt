This collection, according to Mrs.
Richardson, who served as an ad
ministrative assistant of the White
House Conference on Child Health
and Protection during President
Hoover's incumbency, is- representa

The first was the previously men

which President Wilbur, then Sec

chairman. This conference studied
medical service, public health serv

The second source was a medical
committee to study the costs of
medical care, of which Wilbur served
as chairman from 1927 to 1932.
The third was an independent so
ciological research project sponsored

by the White House, and conducted
by leading economists, political sci
entists, and sociologists all over the
country.
