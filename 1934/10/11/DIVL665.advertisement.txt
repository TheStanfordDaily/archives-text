Autobiography
T
JL WAS born twins. Needless to say, my heredity was of
the best. I come from that very fine family line — THE Shoes.
My early life was for the most part spent in traveling—
from-the-factory-to-you-ish sort of thing.
And oh, yes, I'm a very well educated Shoe. How well
I remember my dear teacher saying: "Now, when you gradu
ate and set out to make your footprint in the world, always
remember that you must never pinch nor hurt your mistress."
I've had lessons in the durability of my sole, and my After
life promises to be a long one.
However, now that I've grown up, I've become quite
worldly. I've developed a perfect passion for jolly-ups and
dances, football games, aj-id walking on the Quad. But I can't
slip (morally, of course) becuz I have a beautiful strap that
buckles and holds me down.
My temporary residence is Zwierlein's. Walk-over Boot
Shop, and if you're interested in owning me, I'd dearly love
to have you for my mistress. I'll cost you $5.50.
