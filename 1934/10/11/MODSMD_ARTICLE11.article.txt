## October 19 Decided on As Deadline for Entry Of Ideas, Playlets 
### 
Bids for the position of musical
director for the annual Big Game
Gaieties must be submitted by Octo
ber 18, announces Dick Frank, dra
matic manager. This pre-game fes
tivity, traditionally given on the eve
of the Stanford-California football
contest, begins production this year
fully two weeks ahead of the cus
tomary schedule, in an effort to elim
inate the last-minute confusion usu
ally prevalent.
Dance director, who has entire
charge of routines and selection of
choruses, will be selected by Octo
ber 22, and applicants must also
submit bids by October 18.
Experience Needed
Frank stresses the fact that expe
rience is essential for both positions,
as they bear the major responsibility
of the entire program. Only those
turning in a list of qualifications wilj
be considered.
Any person connected with the
University is eligible, with ability
the only necessity.
Work on musical portions of the
production are to begin immediately
after appointment of the director,
who for the first time also occupies
the post of orchestra leader. Dra
matic Council thus plans to center
the responsibility in one individual,
making the position doubly impor
tant.
Skit Deadline
Deadline for skits has been set at
October 19. Any Stanford student is
invited to submit ideas, sketches, or
brief playlets.
Each Big Game Gaieties introduces
campus - written gongs. The 1934
presentation, predicts Frank, will be
even more melodic than usual. Any
one musically gifted, with a song
already written, or individuals de
siring to collaborate on a number,
should interview Frank within the
next week.
Last date for musical scores is
October 26. With melodies chosen,
tryouts for choruses will be an
nounced. Freshman women, as us
ual, are ineligible.
No Confusion
The one difficulty experienced in
Gaieties of the past, agree Council
members, is the last-minute disor
ganization. More frequent rehear
sals and early naming of cast are
expected to eliminate much of the
customary confusion.
This year, skits, playlets, chorus
numbers, and original songs will be
given equal places in the produc
tion. Settings, promise technical
heads, will be even more elaborate
than in past Gaieties.
November 23, Friday evening, has
been set for the production, which
will probably be followed by an
all-A.S.S.U. dance in the women's
gymnasium.

customary confusion.
This year, skits, playlets, chorus
numbers, and original songs will be
given equal places in the produc
tion. Settings, promise technical
heads, will be even more elaborate
than in past Gaieties.
November 23, Friday evening, has
been set for the production, which
will probably be followed by an
all-A.S.S.U. dance in the women's
gymnasium.
Bids for the position of musical
director for the annual Big Game
Gaieties must be submitted by Octo
ber 18, announces Dick Frank, dra
matic manager. This pre-game fes
tivity, traditionally given on the eve
of the Stanford-California football
contest, begins production this year
fully two weeks ahead of the cus
tomary schedule, in an effort to elim
inate the last-minute confusion usu
ally prevalent.
Dance director, who has entire
charge of routines and selection of
choruses, will be selected by Octo
ber 22, and applicants must also
submit bids by October 18.
Experience Needed
Frank stresses the fact that expe
rience is essential for both positions,
as they bear the major responsibility
of the entire program. Only those
turning in a list of qualifications wilj
be considered.
Any person connected with the
University is eligible, with ability
the only necessity.
Work on musical portions of the
production are to begin immediately
after appointment of the director,
who for the first time also occupies
the post of orchestra leader. Dra
matic Council thus plans to center
the responsibility in one individual,
making the position doubly impor
tant.
Skit Deadline
Deadline for skits has been set at
October 19. Any Stanford student is
invited to submit ideas, sketches, or
brief playlets.
Each Big Game Gaieties introduces
campus - written gongs. The 1934
presentation, predicts Frank, will be
even more melodic than usual. Any
one musically gifted, with a song
already written, or individuals de
siring to collaborate on a number,
should interview Frank within the
next week.
Last date for musical scores is
October 26. With melodies chosen,
tryouts for choruses will be an
nounced. Freshman women, as us
ual, are ineligible.
No Confusion
The one difficulty experienced in
Gaieties of the past, agree Council
members, is the last-minute disor
ganization. More frequent rehear
sals and early naming of cast are
expected to eliminate much of the
customary confusion.
