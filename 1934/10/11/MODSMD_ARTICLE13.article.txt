Few students know any more
j about the Co-op than that two de-
I livery trucks with the name Stan
| ford Wholesale Commissary on them
! are seen daily on the campus. And
! fewer yet realize that the great ma
i jority of the food eaten by over 1000
j —nearly $100,000 worth a year —
j comes to them from a storehouse in
; Branner basement.
Down in that storehouse rows of
| quartered steers and lambs in a large
| modern ice room and dozens of crates
jof food can be seen—all ready to
| find their way onto fraternity and
' eating house tables.
Originated Idea
Eight years ago the Co-op was
, merely an idea in the minds of sev-
I oral enterprising fraternity house
managers, who in 1926 approached
! Comptroller Almon E. Roth with the
| suggestion that some sort of co-
I operative buying be practiced by the
i various living groups on the cam
! pus.
The University officials approved
the plan, and during that same year
j the lead already taken on the coast
, by Oregon State was followed. Pur
| chases of food were combined with
• those of the Stanford Union. Al
i though this system continued for
over a year, problems of storage and
delivery proved it to be impractical.
In January, 1928, a new organiza
tion was formed, known as the
Stanford Wholesale Commissary. It
1 was run entirely by the students, but
| received aid from the University in
! the form of storage space in Bran
j ner basement, financial aid, and the
j services of Elliott Ayres as a trained
i purchasing agent.
The University continued to carry
the expense of management and
storage during the trial period of a
year and a half, during which time
the Co-op provided only the limited
service of weekly deliveries.
28 Members
Following the success of the trial
period, the Co-op was organized for
the first time on a formal basis in
1929, • when a constitution was
adopted and 28 member organiza-
I tions signed five-year contracts. Un
j der these contracts all goods handled
by the Co-op had to be bought ex
clusively from it by members. Serv
: ice was extended to include meats
and canned goods, dairy products,
and some vegetables. Other goods
could be bought directly by mem
-1 bers and billed through the Co-op.
The constitution provided for a
board of directors composed of seven
i members elected by the managers
of the organizations in the Co-op.
' The University continued to aid
: financially, and shared the expenses
of management with the students for
i several years.
Cold storage and butchering equip
. ment was installed, two trucks were
I bought, and the staff of the Co-op
increased to five as it grew in size.
During the past year the member
; ship increased to 33, including 22
j fraternities, 9 sororities, and 2 eating
' clubs.
