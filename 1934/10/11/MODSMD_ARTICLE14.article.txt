# Sinclair Election Would Be Good, Says Hulme
## 
### JOHN McClelland 
The government of California is
| in need of a good shaking-up in
i order to wake up the people and
I start them thinking, and Upton Sin
clair, democratic-socialist candidate
for governor, is one person who
could do something worth while.
Such is the belief of Edward M.
Hulme, professor of history at Stan
ford since 1921, who, though a con
servative on such subjects as litera
ture and art, admits being a whole-
I hearted liberal in matters of gov-
I ernmcnt and politics.
"The main good that would result
1 from the election of Sinclair would
! lie in the fact (hat the election of a
1 socialist to the governor's office
i would cause a great many people
J not only in this state but throughout
I the Union to pause and think," Pro
fessor Hulme stated in an interview
yesterday. "And it also would prove
to be a good thing for both the lead
ing parties of today."
Sinclair would only be able to
carry out a small part of his program
if elected, Professor Hulme believes,
since he would have to have a ma
jority in both houses of the legisla
ture in order to secure the passing

!of laws. But, lacking a legislative
majority, he could resort to the
referendum.
"Then, too, there are some things
that the governor can do without the
concurrence of the legislature," Pro
fessor Hulme went on to say. "And
he would probably do a lot of things
that ought to be done."
"I have little patience with the
conservatives who are predicting dis
, aster in case of Sinclair's election.
Most of those predictions are obvi
ously manufactured for the sole
purpose of scaring the timid and the
unintelligent."
Professor Hulme thinks it should
be made clear that such types of
campaigning as are now being con
ducted in California do not pay.
In Professor Hulme's opinion some
good has already been done by the
I Sinclair campaign. The conservatives
and the standpatters have even start
ed calling themselves liberals.
"I don't expect the millennium in
the coming election, and I feel sure
we won't have disaster. More good
than evil should result from Sin
clair's election," Professor Hulme
concluded.
