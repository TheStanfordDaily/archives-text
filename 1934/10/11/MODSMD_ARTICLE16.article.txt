# PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM SCORED
## Al Rushton Claims Outfit Distorts Intonation 
### 
Is the new $700 public address
system bought by the A.S.S.U. last
spring unable to satisfactorily trans
mit the high and low pitches pro
duced by dance music?
A1 Rushton, leader of the orches
tra that played for the Registration
Dance, says it cannot. Jim Sharpe,
instructor in the Radio Engineering
Lab, who constructed it, Lowell Hol
lingsworth, who operates it, and
Student Manager Ben Cave, who
manages it, say it can.
Good at Game
Volume of the apparatus is quite
satisfactory to all. Used by Yell
Leader Jimmy Triolo to keep the
rooting section informed on what
antics came next during the Santa
Clara game, the address system was
even heard by the players on the
gridiron, who could listen to Triolo's
wise cracks chiming in with the
staid voice of the regular B.A.C.
announcer.
' A portable system that is intended
for use for all A.S.S.U. needs, the
apparatus was constructed according
to the most modern designs by
Sharpe, who also made, with the
help of radio engineering students,
the short-wave radio broadcasting
system successfully used by the Palo
Alto police for the past six months.
No Drapes
Operator Hollingsworth points out
that at the Registration Dance, the
customary drapes, which soften
echoes in the Women's gym, were
missing. He also said that one of
the "visiting firemen" required at
campus dances, commented on the
fact that the new P.A. system trans
mitted the music of the vocalists
and the orchestra better than the
one formerly used.
Ben Cave, on hearing complaints
from Rushton, questioned several
people at the dance and found ev
ex-yone satisfied.
Nevertheless, Rushton claims the
new P.A. system does not do justice
to dance music, and points out that
the cause may lie in the fact that
the microphone is not efficient.
