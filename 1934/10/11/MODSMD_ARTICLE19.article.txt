# Roughs Plan Game Rally For Tonight
## Program To Be Given At Pavilion 
### 
With flaming torches, screeching
horns, and yelling roughs, Stanford
looters will make their way down
the row from the Fiji house to the
Pijvilian tonight at 7:15 on their way
to the Northwestern pre-game rally.
Paraders are asked to be in line for
the noisy trek promptly, as the
torchlight march will begin "on
time." They will be led to the rally
by Assistant Yell Leaders Dick Stark
and Ed Butterworth.
At the Pavilion Head Yell Leader
Jimmy Triolo will take charge and
will introduce Student Body Presi
dent Marvie Kahn. In turn, Kahn
will present as the main speaker of
the evening Harlow Rothert, Stan
ford football and weight star who is
now secretary of the Alumni Asso
ciation. â€¢
Finally, capping the rally, Coach
Claude "Tiny" Thomhill, he of the
broad shoulders and amiable dis
position, will address the student
body, telling of Saturday's plans,
and commenting on the Northwest
ern game.
Escorting Thornhill to the rally
will be the Indian gridders, guests of
honor for the night. Rally commit
tee Chairman Jacobs promises the
1 rally will be short, and snappy.
