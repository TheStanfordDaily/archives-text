Although '"Hell Week" was abol
ished by (he Interfraternity Council
last spring quarter and a "pre
initiation period" was substituted
instead, the class of '37 can find no
joy in the change of terms.
The idea, according to the council,
was to silence criticism directed at
fraternities for the severities of their
"trial by combat" initiations. Among
Hell Week ordeals tabooed were de
struction of private property and
public humiliation of the initiate.
But the prohibitions were not so
strict or so extensive that fraternities
are greatly hampered in initiation.
The Row had its first initiation over
last week-end, and though all in
formation is strictly unofficial, it is
said that "strange and unusual" pun
ishments have not been forgotten in
the course of a year.
Dame Rumor has said, indeed, that
paddles have already been broken
in contacts of a private but informal
nature. The usual 15-mile hikes at
2:30 in the morning in search of
everything from 40 pounds of live
salmon to the July 4, 1832, edition
of Godey's Ladies Book will prob
ably be the source of much trouble
for row sophomores this year.
