# And So, in Parting

### 
In October, 1933, a Daily editor wired
Franklin Delano Roosevelt that the Stamoiu)
Daily was "proud to join the NBA." Since
that time, this newspaper has Mown the Blue
Eagle from ils front page and lias very seri
ously, deliberately done its part, however
small that part may have been, to aid the
cause that might possibly bring about a re
turn of thai intangible something called "pros
perity" to I lie people of this country.

The Daily no longer boasts a Blue Eagle.
I»eliinpiishing its claim to membership in the
MIA, it believes that any need Mr an NBA
(granted one there was) is no more. What
there is or was of the NBA has not been Ihe
idealistic I'topia that the Daily fought for
one year ago.
Admitting that nothing of mortal concep
tion can he perfect at once if at all, I lie NBA
lias been a most controversial subject from
start to Ihe beginning of Ihe now-apparent
linish. Even if it had been a good idea origi
nally, il never could have worked for the
advantage of the country as a whole as long
as il embodied more politics than solid eco
nomics in ils composition.
Big Business was afraid of it at the outset,
looked askance al the Administration, and
proceeded to chip in whole-heartedly in back
ing Ihe project. A sort of last straw effect, and
things were pretty desperate at the lime.
Today, even Big Business is not bragging
"NBA" except where it is necessary to sell
merchandise.
The Daily believes that the NBA has ruined
too many of Ihe merchants In
stead of helping the little man by allowing him
to make more money by selling less at greater
prices, il in many cases has allowed him to
sell less at higher rates, but with no marked
increase in net returns, and often with very
noticeable losses in revenue.
On the other hand, the large organization
has been able to produce more (because of
established reputation, belter organization,
etc.), demand more, and show an increase in
revenue. But still with increased costs, no
body is claiming that I hey are very much bet
ter oIT than before. And'yet, because there
are so many variable factors to be considered,
one cannot say with assurance just what part
the NBA has played during the past year in
the field of economic welfare.
Therefore, il is not for these reasons par
ticularly that Ihe Daily drops from activity
with the NBA. More important is the political
aspect which has, at least, prevented Ihe real
lest ing of the NBA as intended by ils founders.
(lode authorities possessing practically un
limited power have been appointed to repre
sent Washington in local disputes. These
authorities have been al the same time, in
most cases (which is natural if they are to
be considered "authorities" in their field),
leading executives in private companies vitally
interested in the operation of their own par
ticular Code.
If Ihey wished, these men could run their
own particular locality to suit themselves.
Smaller concerns would have to do as they
were told, and if a small outfit violated the
Code, somebody immediately "cracked down."
II the larger organization was accused of doing
the same thing, a denial by the Authority to
Himself would in most cases suffice.
A sad affair, no doubt. But politics and
the spoils system at its worsl. And at a time
when everyone should have been co-operating
ill every del a i I to see that Mr. Boosevelt's effort
to aid the country should have a fair chance.
The much-publicized rift in policy-direclion,
the .fohnson - Bichberg split, and the many
other factors are matters of fairly common
knowledge.
In any event, Ihe NBA is going by-bve.
Washington will do its best to save the really
useful features wherever possible. It is with
the knowledge that Franklin Roosevelt is
aiming to do his level best to aid his country
that the Daily makes its decision.

Big Business was afraid of it at the outset,
looked askance al the Administration, and
proceeded to chip in whole-heartedly in back
ing Ihe project. A sort of last straw effect, and
things were pretty desperate at the lime.
Today, even Big Business is not bragging
"NBA" except where it is necessary to sell
merchandise.
The Daily believes that the NBA has ruined
too many of Ihe merchants In
stead of helping the little man by allowing him
to make more money by selling less at greater
prices, il in many cases has allowed him to
sell less at higher rates, but with no marked
increase in net returns, and often with very
noticeable losses in revenue.
On the other hand, the large organization
has been able to produce more (because of
established reputation, belter organization,
etc.), demand more, and show an increase in
revenue. But still with increased costs, no
body is claiming that I hey are very much bet
ter oIT than before. And'yet, because there
are so many variable factors to be considered,
one cannot say with assurance just what part
the NBA has played during the past year in
the field of economic welfare.
Therefore, il is not for these reasons par
ticularly that Ihe Daily drops from activity
with the NBA. More important is the political
aspect which has, at least, prevented Ihe real
lest ing of the NBA as intended by ils founders.
(lode authorities possessing practically un
limited power have been appointed to repre

authorities have been al the same time, in
most cases (which is natural if they are to
be considered "authorities" in their field),
leading executives in private companies vitally
interested in the operation of their own par
ticular Code.
If Ihey wished, these men could run their
own particular locality to suit themselves.
Smaller concerns would have to do as they
were told, and if a small outfit violated the
Code, somebody immediately "cracked down."
II the larger organization was accused of doing
the same thing, a denial by the Authority to
Himself would in most cases suffice.
A sad affair, no doubt. But politics and
the spoils system at its worsl. And at a time
when everyone should have been co-operating

to aid the country should have a fair chance.
The much-publicized rift in policy-direclion,
the .fohnson - Bichberg split, and the many

In any event, Ihe NBA is going by-bve.
