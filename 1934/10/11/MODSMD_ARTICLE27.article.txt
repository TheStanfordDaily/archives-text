A slender, brown-eyed hid is hastening from
I lie quid of the English count rysidc to assume
liis place in hislorv today, while the world
comitates the rude fact that the Paris Peaee
Conference did not erase eternal human stu
pidity with such careless grace ;is once seemed
I he case.
The Jugoslavian problem may not be an
insoluble one, but none seem equal to the task
of understanding or making order out of ils
hodgepodge of clashing ethnic, religious, and
historical groups. Before (he war, Jugoslavia
was scattered under si\ different govern
ments; ils deputies served in fourteen na
tional or provincial parliaments. Today it is
ramified with three dominant racial entities
which commonly use two different alphabets
and serve three religions.
Italy has quarreled with it endlessly over
naval and commercial supremacy in the Adri
atic and has insinuated her armed forces
through Dalmatia to its very threshold. The
resentful nations of Austria, Hungary, and
Bulgaria press it from the north and east,
nursing pre Peace Conference grudges.
Despite ;iid and reassurances from Britain
and I'ranee, Jugoslavia is foundering in ecu

' nomic stagnation, while the Slovenes ami
Croats are disturbed because of tbe ascend
ancy of Serbia in the tri-partite government.
All Slovenes and many Croats fought with
the (Central Powers and now find themselves
bedfellows with the Serbs who supported the
Allies. It was an inllamed C.roat who dealt
death to Kin# Alexander. All three races
nourish a stubborn independence, survival of
their lon# struggle against the Turk. Croatia
has once revolted from the union, in .Inly,
11)19, but the rebellion was short-lived.
The government at Belgrade holds the sack;
debates the respective advantages of central
ized government and local autonomy; suggests
a union of Southern Slavs as a possible
remedy. War appears imminent.
This, then, is the beautiful prospect facing
young King Peter at a time when American
! youths enjoy the privilege of one o' cat and
aggies for keeps. A most interesting' game.
