### BOB JONES 
WILL IRWIN, STANFORD MAN
Down in Greenwich village, wedged between a
string of identical appearing houses typical of New
York's west side, squatted the four-story, one-room
wide home of Will Irwin, one of the nation's top-notch
writers, and former Stanford man at the Farm with
Hoover and Wilbur.
That compressed house, built in 1812 by the Dobbs
of hat fame and fortune and later restored by the
Irwins, was the object of my search one Saturday in
late May. Seated in an easy chair in the living room,
musing on a cigarette, while the radio sputtered un
noticed, was Mr. Irwin.
After I had introduced myself and had mentioned
the fact that I was from Stanford, the writer enthusias
tically asked me to sit down and listen to the broad
cast of the 1.C.4-A. track meet.
"You're just in time," he remarked. "I'm waiting to
hear how our boys from th% Farm are going to do
this afternoon."
I later found that he had kept in close touch with
Stanford's varsities in track and football. He was
familiar with the favorites in the meet that afternoon.
The ensuing victories of Blackman, Lyman, Dunn, and
Klopstock led him to revert to his undergraduate days
on the campus in the early 'nineties. He recounted
friendships with Hoover and Wilbur.
"Farthest from our minds during college days was
the thought that some day Hoover might become Presi
dent of the United States," Mr. Irwin recalled. "All ot
us knew lhat he would make good and live comfortably,
but we never dreamed of his occupying the White
House.
"Contrary to unfounded talk, Hoover did not have
a regular hashing job in a sorority. He used to do odd
jobs, along with a cleaning agency there on the
campus."
Mr. Irwin remembered President Wilbur during
college days for his work in disclosing a fraudulent
election and for his activity in campus politics.
Far from being the pictured average writer was ihe
former Stanford man. He was large, rough appearing,
and kindly. From appearances he might have been
taken for a skilled laborer or craftsman.
He had just started work, he said, on a new novel,
the contents of which he did not disclose. "My hours,
when writing, are very irregular. One morning I might
arise at 4, 5, or 6 o'clock and work far into the night,
taking time off once in a while to eat. Then a day might
pass when I spend only a short time on the book. The
most difficult period in the writing is the exact plan
ning of the story. Weeks of constant organizing are
necessary to arrange a plot that suits me."
Several days later Mr. Irwin obtained a temporary
membership for me in the Players' Club. New York's
outstanding club for writers and actors, founded by
Edwin Boothe, one of the greatest of all American
actors. It was there that I met and talked with Otis
Skinner, the actor.
Tomorrow we return to politics by introducing lhat
most astute politician, Secretary of Commerce Roper.

when writing, are very irregular. One morning I might
arise at 4, 5, or 6 o'clock and work far into the night,
taking time off once in a while to eat. Then a day might
pass when I spend only a short time on the book. The
most difficult period in the writing is the exact plan

necessary to arrange a plot that suits me."
Several days later Mr. Irwin obtained a temporary

Skinner, the actor.

WILL IRWIN, STANFORD MAN
Down in Greenwich village, wedged between a
string of identical appearing houses typical of New
York's west side, squatted the four-story, one-room
wide home of Will Irwin, one of the nation's top-notch
writers, and former Stanford man at the Farm with
Hoover and Wilbur.
That compressed house, built in 1812 by the Dobbs
of hat fame and fortune and later restored by the
Irwins, was the object of my search one Saturday in
late May. Seated in an easy chair in the living room,
musing on a cigarette, while the radio sputtered un
noticed, was Mr. Irwin.
After I had introduced myself and had mentioned
the fact that I was from Stanford, the writer enthusias
tically asked me to sit down and listen to the broad
cast of the 1.C.4-A. track meet.
"You're just in time," he remarked. "I'm waiting to
hear how our boys from th% Farm are going to do
this afternoon."
I later found that he had kept in close touch with
Stanford's varsities in track and football. He was
familiar with the favorites in the meet that afternoon.
The ensuing victories of Blackman, Lyman, Dunn, and
Klopstock led him to revert to his undergraduate days
on the campus in the early 'nineties. He recounted
friendships with Hoover and Wilbur.
"Farthest from our minds during college days was
the thought that some day Hoover might become Presi
dent of the United States," Mr. Irwin recalled. "All ot
us knew lhat he would make good and live comfortably,
but we never dreamed of his occupying the White
House.
"Contrary to unfounded talk, Hoover did not have
a regular hashing job in a sorority. He used to do odd
jobs, along with a cleaning agency there on the
campus."
Mr. Irwin remembered President Wilbur during
college days for his work in disclosing a fraudulent
election and for his activity in campus politics.
Far from being the pictured average writer was ihe
former Stanford man. He was large, rough appearing,
and kindly. From appearances he might have been
taken for a skilled laborer or craftsman.
He had just started work, he said, on a new novel,
the contents of which he did not disclose. "My hours,
when writing, are very irregular. One morning I might
arise at 4, 5, or 6 o'clock and work far into the night,
taking time off once in a while to eat. Then a day might
