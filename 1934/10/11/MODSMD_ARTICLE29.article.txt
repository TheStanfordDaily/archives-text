## WITH KLARA FETTER 
### CHARLOTTE BURRIDGE 
Professors of international affairs, steeped in the
seemingly hopeless turmoil of European relations, pre
dict war as a result of the recent assassination of King
Alexander of Jugoslavia and Foreign Minister Louis
Barthou, of France. Klara Fetter, library research as
sistant, born and educated in Hungary, has an inside
viewpoint drawn from her regular reading of Hun
garian newspapers and other periodicals, and her study
at the University of Budapest, where she received
her Ph.D.
"I don't see any imminent danger of war except
thai of civil war. If civil war should break out. all of
Jugoslavia's neighbors will take advantage of her situa
tion. However, I don't think any neighbor wants to
fire the first shot," she says.
Miss Fetter thinks a civil war is quite likely and
that as a result the dictatorship will be reorganized on
a federal basis. One of the principal seats of dissatis
faction is Croatia. The inhabitants want greater inde
pendence, and the problem will have to be solved soon.
"One cannot tell what will happen," the charming
young Hungarian declared hopelessly, "the Serbian
military party is so strong and it dominates the most
of Jugoslavia."
"I am very anxious to see France's reaction. A gen
eral public resentment is quite likely. But just as in the
Dolfuss situation the European states don't wish to start
a war. They have no money and are not sufficiently
prepared."
Asked if she suspected any alien organization's work
in the shooting, the classic authority replied that there
might be a political group behind the assassin. "In fact,"
she added, "there probably was, for he must have
gotten the arms from somewhere. There is a chance,
however, that the murderer was just a personally
embittered Croatian exile."
Miss Fenton, who lived in Budapest until a few
years ago, turned to her own country with a feeling of
satisfaction.
"I don't fhink Hungary will be anxious to inter
fere before other countries although flic Jugoslav-
Ilungarian relations are strained due to the shooting of
1(1 or 111 frontier property owners this summer."
It will be recalled that a number of Hungarians who
owned property on both sides of the border were
killed by Jugoslav frontier guards.
"Of course these frontier situations are rather usual,"
she said laughingly with her soft accent, "but. this
was more serious than other troubles they have had
at the frontier."
Hungary wrote a protest to the League of Nations
but nothing really worth-while was ever done about
it, The Dollfuss murder blew over, too, because no
one was in the position to cause any disturbance over
the matter, Now comes the double hard feelings of
Jugoslavia and France, witli the same probable future
of a lot of talking and little doini;.
