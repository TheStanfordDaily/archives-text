The Editor, Sir:
B.A.C. announces no admission to
; the Stanford - Northwestern game
| unless you pay one and ten for the
privilege of occupying the section
reserved for imitators of the genus
Sus, and simultaneously a "Daily"'
editorial casts reflections and great
chunks of heavy irony at any Stan
ford
". . . man with soul so dead,
Who never to himself hath said
'This is my own, my native team,
j and I will support it by attending
every game.' "
Is it not barely possible that ane
mic attendance might result not from
indifference, but from actual inabil
! ity to spare the money? One hun
dred and ten pennies is lots an' lots
! of pennies, believe it or not.
Though a new student, I am fast
developing a great fondness—l might
almost say love —for Stanford, an
1 appreciation of the friendly and
democratic spirit of her students and
organizations—
" 'A.S.S.U.' loves me,
This I know;
For the 'Bible'
Tells me so.' "
and a lot of enthusiasm and interest
over her records her teams have
; made in the past and their prospects
j for the present season. I have been
| looking forward to attending at least}
all the home games, and, not being
wise in the ways of university finan
; ting, I naturally thought my activi
-1 ties ticket would surely allow me to
i see my own team play on the home
! field.
So I and my delicately-balanced
budget were both sadly disturbed to
hear that additional charges will be
made at home games. Now I must 1
1 save my ducats for the "Big Game"
and miss some of the preceeding
contests, for how do I know what |
that game will cost me?—and ducats
1 are, oh, so scarce.
I may be a lone voice crying out
in the wilderness, but I think not.
It's going to be hard for a lot of us
to dig up a dollar or two for each
game—and that is the big reason
back of our so-called "indifference."
Respectfully yours,

1 save my ducats for the "Big Game"
and miss some of the preceeding
contests, for how do I know what |
that game will cost me?—and ducats
1 are, oh, so scarce.
I may be a lone voice crying out
in the wilderness, but I think not.
It's going to be hard for a lot of us
to dig up a dollar or two for each
game—and that is the big reason
back of our so-called "indifference."
Respectfully yours,
