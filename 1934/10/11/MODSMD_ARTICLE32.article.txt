MURDER ON THE DIAMOND
At the Stanford. Palo Alto
"Murder on the Diamond," which
started its run yesterday at the Fox
Stanford, is obviously calculated to
profit by the current World Series
enthusiasm, delicately tinged with

romance, horror,
and comedy. If
you like thrill
ers with whole
sa 1 e murders,
stalwart heroes
and young
blonde heroines,
you'll like it.

Otherwise—we dunno!
Robert Young, stellar pitcher, is
hired in an effort to win the pen
nant for a declining ball club; the
owner's daughter, Madge Evans, is
also the team's secretary, thus gain
ing a position in every shot, includ
ing, strangely enough, those in the
locker room.
This is the sort of picture in
which you'd know, without being
told, that Young would hit a home
run in the last inning of the last
crucial game of the series (after
pitching for ten innings), -to win
the game, the girl, r*etain the' ball
club for her father, and apprehend
the three-time killer. Never be
fore, to this reviewer's meager
knowledge, have such unusual mur
ders been committed. And never,
may we add, was a murderer more
completely unsuspected. This is not
a recommendation.

In spite of its dime novel charac
teristics, the picture has fair enter
tainment value. Miss Evans, though
deserving of a vastly more intelli
gent role, succeeds in being decora
tive; frequent comedy intersperses
the more grisley moments; and the
director actually succeeds in cre
ating a ghastly atmosphere in a ball
park, no small feat in itself.
