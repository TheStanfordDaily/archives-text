THE THEATER IN NEW YORK:
I. The Season Opens
(Editor's Note: This is the lirst in
a series of articles on the current
New York Theater season, espe
cially prepared fur this column hy
our eastern correspondent, James
Sandoe.)
Almost 20 optimistic managers
have opened shows on and oft Broad
way during the past few but
the quantity of the new season has
yet to be matched by its quality.
For of all the current productions,
only one may be said to be deserving
of lull-hearted praise.
The O'Oyly Carte Company from
the Savoy Theatre, London, has re
turned to the States after a five-year
absence, with a repertoire of the
Gilbert and Sullivan comic operas
which are presented in its own truly
inimitable fashion.
I have seen a good many bad pro
ductions of Gilbert and Sullivan
which, nevertheless, have failed to
dim altogether the humor or wreak
complete havoc upon the beauty and
wit of the scores. But it is an im
mense pleasure to see these comic
operas given full justice by a com
pany of good singers, steeped in
Savoyard traditions, losing no op
portunities which the scripts afford.
Reports inform me that the com
pany is to be seen shortly after
Christmas in San Francisco. Neecf
less to say, these productions should
be put on the "must be seen" list.
Tobacco Road, with James Barton
as competent successor to Henry
Hull, is still current in is eleventh
month. Although its insane and
gruesome humor twice breaks and
the play consequently sinks into
sticky pathos, it is otherwise — and,
indeed, on the whole—a sincerely
conceived genre comedy, not ren
dered spurious by undue sentimen
tality or a prediliction on the part
oi the author to moralize.
