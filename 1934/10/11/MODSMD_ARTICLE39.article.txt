# Law Breakers Taken Before Men's Council
## "Nab Speeders" Code Of Campus Police Force 
### 
Owing to the fact that the Men's
Council is not a complete body at
the present time, Stanford speeders
and parking violators have had an
easy time of it, but after today's
election when the Men's Council is
once more organized, woe be it to the
man or woman who infringes on
campus traffic ordinances. This piece
of information was divulged yester
day by George Burns, campus night
patrolman.
Those violators who have been ap
prehended up to last Monday have
either been warned or found a yel
low ticket on the car. The yellow
was merely a warning, but since
Monday grey has replaced the yel
low and from now on the violator
must talk to the council.
In the past speeders have suffered
the greatest at the hands of the
council, some being fined as high as
$30. However, the majority that ap
pear before the council are charged
with violating campus parking or
dinances. The forbidden zones that
have caused the greatest trouble in
the past are the chemistry building
path, the English corner zone, the
Daily zone, the parking lot en
trances, and the post-office.
Owing to the increase in the num
ber of cars on the campus, it is
thought that both councils will be
more harsh in the matter of speed
ers. The speed limit on the campus
is 20 miles an hour around the Quad,
15 at intersections, and 30 is the
maximum on Palm Drive.
