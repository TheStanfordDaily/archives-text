Dry-point etchings by Jeanette
Maxfield Lewis are on exhibit at the
Thomas Welton Stanford Art Gal
lery.
Miss Lewis is a comparatively new
figure in the print world, but has
risen l'apidly to the top rank.
Connoisseurs have noticed in her
productions a striking similarity to
the work of Armin Hansen, Carmel's
famous etcher of marine scenes.
Some of her work, in fact, was done
in collaboration with Hansen.
Like Hansen, Miss Lewis excels
in marine subjects; like him, too,
her etchings center about Monterey
Bay. Although several of the scenes
involve rolling hills, circus tents,
farm buildings, etc., the fishing
scenes are most realistic, more artis
tic. Angling. Fishing Fleet, and Mon
terey Waterfront are typical titles.
