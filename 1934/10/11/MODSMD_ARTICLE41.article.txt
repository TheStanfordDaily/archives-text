# Season's First Jolly-Up Given by Lagunita Union
## 
### 
Storming the Women's gym in an
uproarious manner, approximately
350 Stanford roughs appeared at last
night's Lagunita-Union Jolly-up, the !
first get-together this season.
Swaying to the music of A1 Rush
ton and his Royal Cardinals, danc
ers milled about the room in typical
Jolly-up fashion. Stags, contrary to
their usual custom of lining around
the side of the floor to survey the
dancing, gathered in large groups in
the center of the room.
Hostesses were aided in introduc
ing the new women by Encina spon- j
sors and officers of Toyon. Before j
the jolly-up, men sponsors were en- '
tertained at dinner in Lagunita by a I
group of hostesses.
