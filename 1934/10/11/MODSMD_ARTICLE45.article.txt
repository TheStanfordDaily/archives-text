# FEATURE STEEL BAG FOR RUSS DIRIGIBLE
## 
### 
MOSCOW, Oct. 11. — Russia is
building an all-metal dirigible with
a cigar-shaped tube of paper-thin
steel substituting for a fabric gas
bag, in a factory near Moscow. The
dirigible is the first of its kind in
Russia and probably in the world.
It is being constructed from plans
made by Konstantine Tsiolsovsky,
77-year-old engineer and physicist,
who first suggested the«idea of all
metal airships to an incredulous
world as far back as 1887.
Unlike all others. Tsialsovsky's
dirigible will dispense entirely with
interior framework. Sheets of non
corrosive steel ten millimeters thick,
bolted together to form the gas bag,
will give sufficient rigidity, accord
ing to the plans.
Only two struts will be used, these
to run longitudinally along the bot
tom of the bag to serve as supports
from which the gondola will swing.
The new principle in balloon con
struction will give a greater meas
ure of safety than is the case with or
dinary dirigibles, it is asserted by
Russian authorities.
