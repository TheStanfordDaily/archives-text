# Japan To Ask Abrogation Of Naval Treaty
## Yamomoto Makes Forecast Of Nippon's Policies 
### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 10 (/P>. â€”Rear
Admiral Osoroku Yamamoto, Japa
nese delegate to the London naval
conferences, said before sailing to
day that it is his opinion Japan will
ask for abrogation of the Washington
naval treaty.
The Japanese delegate expressed
the opinion when asked whether
Japan planned an abrogation of the
treaty, which provides a 5-5-3 naval
ratio for the United States, England,
and Japan.
"Of course," he replied, "abroga
tion is something which must be
taken up by the government itself.
The preliminax-y negotiations at Lon
don are something apart from the
Washington treaty. The thing that
Japan will ask for at London can
not be reconciled with the provisions
of the treaty, which are based on the
ratio system.
"It is my opinion that the Japanese
government will ask for the abroga
tion of the Washington treaty, but
the abrogation will not take place
through the negotiations in London."
The admiral was asked whether
Japan was seeking a parity of naval
strength with England and the Uni
ted States.
"It may be possible," he said, "to
interpret Japan's demands as par
ity, though I am not using that par
ticular expression. What we do want
is a naval strength which will be
sufficient to guarantee our national
security. We expect, of course, that
that same right shall be accorded to
all the powers concerned."
Norman H. Davis, special envoy of
the United States to Europe, and
Admiral William H. Standley, chief
of naval operations, sailed for Eng
land today on the liner Manhattan
to participate in the naval conversa
tions.
