# BRADSHAW WORKS GRIDMEN HARD TO PERFECT OFFENCE
## Freshmen Meet San Jose State Saturday For Preliminary Game 
### 
The intensive drill which Coach
Jimmy Bradshaw has given the l'rosh
gridders this week proves that the
Babes mean to have an offense that
clicks when they meet the San Jose
State Frosh in Saturday's prelimi
nary.
Last Saturday's 32-0 win over
Monk) Junior College showed plenty
of power in the Frosh ranks, but
the offense was ragged. A week or
so of drilling should give the Frosh
the timing and co-ordination be
tween players necessary for the ef
fective functioning of an offense as
complicated as the one the Frosh are
using.
While the first string went over
their plays on the dummies the sec
ond string engaged in a scrimmage
with Husky Hunt's Grays.
Though Frosh followers had their
eyes most on the tackle play of Otto
Beringer, 250-pound weight man
and gridder, the player who stole the
show was Johnny Campbell, a small
but smooth Gray back. Campbell
calmly tossed 30 yards to Ed Becker
to put the ball on the five-yard line,
then bucked over for the lone score
of the game.
Grant Stone worked out with the
first eleven, but whether he can hold
down an end job Saturday without
protection for his injured nose is
doubtful. Back Ed Gillette is still
hobbling with an injured knea and
Don Gregory, guard, has not yet ob
tained the okay of Fritz Roth for his
broken collar bone.
