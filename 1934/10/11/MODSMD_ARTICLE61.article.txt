# WOMEN'S EXAMS TAX DEPARTMENT
## 
### 
Because of the record-breaking
number of the fairer sex on the
Farm this year and the prepon
derance of lower division women for
whom some sort of physical exer
tion is required, the physical edu
cation department is having trouble.
Many of the classes were filled
the first day of registration, and the
hockey turn-out bodes well for a
good team, but crowds the gym in
the late afternoons.
One of the main difficulties this
year has been with the physical ex
aminations. Alth&ugh women living
near the campus had their examina
tions early, the number of those
to be examined was so great that
physical examinations are still be
ing held. Fall quarter last year the
examinations were all concluded
within the first three days after reg
istration. The situation is made
more difficult by the fact that, old
women as well .as new must be
examined.
Comptroller Roth stresses (he fact
which has often been overlooked,
that it is remarkable that the gym
nasium, which was built for 500
women, has so easily accommodated
the "1000."
U.S.C. is welcoming 25 Japanese
freshmen to its campus this fall.
