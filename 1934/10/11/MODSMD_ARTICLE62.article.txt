# LEO COOK LEADS WATER POLD MEN FROM NEW POST
## Bob Foster, Vlad Taranik Strong Shots; First Game Oct. 17 
### 
Recent practices of the varsity
water polo team have made it ap
parent that Stanford has in Ciiptain
Leo Cook a strong candidate for i
all-American honors this year. Coach |
Nort Thornton considers the huge
Card leader, playing his new position
of forward, an even better shot than
Phil Daubenspeck, L.A.A.C. sensa
tion, who was the brightest star on
the 1932 Olympic team.
Cook is equally adept with both
hands, and is a wizard at hitting the
goal corners with shots from the
surface. He has been pacing the at
tack of a team which has run up
high scores in scrimmages. Cook's
shots travel like bullets, and are often
total surprises to the opposition.
Scoring Threats
Bob Foster and Vlad Taranik
would fight it out for scoring lead
ership if it were not for Cook. As it
is, they closely rival Leo, both in
sharp-shooting and in feeding and
defensive work. These three aquatic
greats should make their senior year
their best, although it will be a hard
job to improve on their fine play of
the past two seasons.
Foster has been called "a dynamo,
a terror on offense and a demon on
defense" by Thornton. The swim
ming captain-elect won a regular
post on the varsity septet at the start
last year after transferring from
Long Beach Junior College.
Taranik was leading scorer of the
league and an all-Coast forward last
year. From the sprint position, he is
likely to throw a goal, long or short,
at any time.
Fast Forwards
Wally Wiget, Bill Woodard, and
Jimmy Benet compose a fast-moving,
alert trio of guards who constantly
feed the forwards. Jock Haslacher,
sophomore goal guard, has been one
of the mainstays of the team, as it
\akes a powerful and tricky shooter
to pa?s him.
The second string, consisting of
Bill Clemo, Bob Etienne, and Bob
Hoover at forwards; Bob Harris, Bud
DeMyers. and "Pat" Pearson at
guards; and Hunt Kingsbury and
Ben Voss, fighting with them for
guard positions, has looked good in
scrimmages, also.
Law step traditions are being vio
lated this year.
