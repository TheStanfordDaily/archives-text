# Cards Prepare For Wildcat Game
## INDIAN GRIDMEN MAY ENTER GAME WITHOUT GRAYSON Hip Bruise To Keep Bobby On Bench in Wildcat Battle Saturday 
### Millard Browne 
It may be Stanford minus the
spark Saturday when Tiny Thorn- }
hill's Indians meet Northwestern in
i intersectional combat at the Stan
| lord Stadium without the services of !
i Bobby Grayson.
The Portland Boomer, who has 1
furnished the offensive zip for
Stanford's touchdown drives in
nearly every case this year, will j
watch the Indians and Wildcats from ;
the bench this year.
This was almost definitely decided
last night following Grayson's third
absence from practice. Dr. Fritz 1
Roth, team physician, said Bobby!
would not work out today, and it is -
believed Thornhill will not play him
at all unless it seems necessary for
victory.
Grayson Recovering
Grayson is recovering from a pain- j
ful bruise on a nerve center in his |
hip, and to protect it, the padding !
would have to be such as to per-I
ceptibly slow up his leg movement.
The bruise is not serious, and it will j
be well within a few days.
Bones Hamilton will take over
Grayson's signal calling and ball- j
toting duties at fullback, with Gor- |
don Head moving into Hamilton's
position at right wing.
Thornhill said Bob Maentz will
start at left halfback instead of j
Buck Van Dellen. Frankie Alustiza
is again slated to appear at quarter
back.
A lengthy scrimmage with the first |
string taking the defensive against 1
Northwestern plays administered by (
the third team featured yesterday's ;
gruelling practice.
Alustiza, protecting a bruised side, j
took a lighter work-out, and Earl
Hoos worked in the quarterback
berth during the scrimmage. The |
rest of the backfield was made up of
the probable starters Saturday.
Moscrip, Topping at Flanks
In the line, Monk Moscrip and
Keith Topping were working at the 1
flanks, Bob Reynolds and Claude i
Callaway again appeared as tackles, j
Woody Adams and Larry Rouble
played in the guard positions, and
Niels Larsen worked at center.
The center position on the starting
team is still a toss-up between Lar
sen and Wes Muller, who is rapidly
getting back into good condition. It
was hinted last night that Muiler
may start, although Larsen played a
smooth defensive game in the
scrimmage.

getting back into good condition. It
was hinted last night that Muiler
may start, although Larsen played a
smooth defensive game in the
scrimmage.
It may be Stanford minus the
spark Saturday when Tiny Thorn- }
hill's Indians meet Northwestern in
i intersectional combat at the Stan
| lord Stadium without the services of !
i Bobby Grayson.
The Portland Boomer, who has 1
furnished the offensive zip for
Stanford's touchdown drives in
nearly every case this year, will j
watch the Indians and Wildcats from ;
the bench this year.
This was almost definitely decided
last night following Grayson's third
absence from practice. Dr. Fritz 1
Roth, team physician, said Bobby!
would not work out today, and it is -
believed Thornhill will not play him
at all unless it seems necessary for
victory.
Grayson Recovering
Grayson is recovering from a pain- j
ful bruise on a nerve center in his |
hip, and to protect it, the padding !
would have to be such as to per-I
ceptibly slow up his leg movement.
The bruise is not serious, and it will j
be well within a few days.
Bones Hamilton will take over
Grayson's signal calling and ball- j
toting duties at fullback, with Gor- |
don Head moving into Hamilton's
position at right wing.
Thornhill said Bob Maentz will
start at left halfback instead of j
Buck Van Dellen. Frankie Alustiza
is again slated to appear at quarter
back.
A lengthy scrimmage with the first |
string taking the defensive against 1
Northwestern plays administered by (
the third team featured yesterday's ;
gruelling practice.
Alustiza, protecting a bruised side, j
took a lighter work-out, and Earl
Hoos worked in the quarterback
berth during the scrimmage. The |
rest of the backfield was made up of
the probable starters Saturday.
Moscrip, Topping at Flanks
In the line, Monk Moscrip and
Keith Topping were working at the 1
flanks, Bob Reynolds and Claude i
Callaway again appeared as tackles, j
Woody Adams and Larry Rouble
played in the guard positions, and
Niels Larsen worked at center.
The center position on the starting
team is still a toss-up between Lar
sen and Wes Muller, who is rapidly
getting back into good condition. It
was hinted last night that Muiler
may start, although Larsen played a
smooth defensive game in the
scrimmage.
