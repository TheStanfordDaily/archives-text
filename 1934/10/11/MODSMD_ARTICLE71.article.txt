# INDIAN SPRINTERS LACK SPEED FOR U.C., U.S.C. ACES
## 
### 
Working out daily on Angell Field
are several varsity sprinters, in prep
aration for a stiff spring campaign.
Among them are Martin Baskin, Al
Cranston, Alex Faye and Al Black
man. All have done 10 flat.
Baskin, at his best last year in the
Fresno Relays, ran a leg of thg short
relay in 9.8. He did 10 fiat for Sac
ramento High. Crangton two years
ago was secondary school champion
in the 100. 220, and 440. Faye was
frosh sprinter last year, along with
Chuck Voight, who will be out later.
Blackmail was a frosh sprinter, but
must of course, be classed now as a
440 man. He may en,ter the 220 in
meets next spring.
U.C. Fast , "
These men are better-than-aver
age sprinters, but it Is getting to be
a more obvious fact all the time that
they will be able to do very little
against conference opponents U.C.
and S.C. next year.
Brutus Hamilton at Cal has George
Anderson and Mushby Pollack. Both
think nothing of a 9.7 century, and
only last Friday coasted through
races in 9.9. He also has Jim Helmer
and Eddie Vallejo, from Piedmont
and Berkeley, both of whom estab
lished high school records, and will
be out in the spring.
Draper Back
Dean Cromwell at S.C. will again
have Foy Draper, diminutive flash,
who has marks of 9.6 and 20.8. He
will also have big Red Abbott, and
a couple of high schoo\ flashes up
from the frosh. Carl Thorns, who
practiced for the meets on his cornet
here last year, will lose a year of
competition via the S.C. transfer
route.
Stanford's main hope of a point or
two in the sprints, then, is Ray Dean,
who is for all practical purposes en
tering Stanford in January from San
Mateo J.C. If he can hit below 9.8
often enough it should go a long way
against the other schools.

be out in the spring.
Draper Back
Dean Cromwell at S.C. will again
have Foy Draper, diminutive flash,
who has marks of 9.6 and 20.8. He
will also have big Red Abbott, and
a couple of high schoo\ flashes up
from the frosh. Carl Thorns, who
practiced for the meets on his cornet
here last year, will lose a year of
competition via the S.C. transfer
route.
Stanford's main hope of a point or
two in the sprints, then, is Ray Dean,
who is for all practical purposes en
tering Stanford in January from San
Mateo J.C. If he can hit below 9.8
often enough it should go a long way
against the other schools.
