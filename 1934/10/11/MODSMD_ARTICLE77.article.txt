# VETS, FROSH POLO OUTFITS WARM UP FOR 1935 SEASON
## 
### 
Out around the polo field and the
R.O.T.C. stables there's plenty of
riding going on these warm after
noons, although little of it looks like
polo. The fact of the matter is that
out there nearly every day are last
year's veterans and 20 or more frosh,
warming up various of the sixty polo
mounts for their first "scrimmage"
early in November, after a long sum
mer of inactivity.
In the meantime, Lieutenant Hay
den Y. Grub, here to take Captain
Gordan's place, is trying to decide, as
he watches them work out, whether
Luppen, Rogers, Rasmussen, and
Fuller ton are the four to ride in the
first team again this year, or whether
Emeis, Enemark, McKeon, Harris,
Henderson, Coffin. McCarthy, Steel
quist, or some of this year's new
comers may take their places.
Also keeping Lieutenant Grub
busy are the group of 17 new ponies
and a larger number of riders, all
showing great promise of building
up the strongest reserves any Stan
ford team has had, but needing con
siderable coaching at the present.
Very little that is definite has been
announced regarding this year's
schedule, although indications are
that all of the teams who went down
in 20 games out of the 22 the Indians
played last season will be back to
try to change the count this year.
But when they meet up with any
of the twelve or more Redshirts who
are as good as any of last year's
riders, their chances of doing that
appear slight.
Stanford's "Hello" tradition is go
ing out of use with the Class of '38.
