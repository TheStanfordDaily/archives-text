## Men Rest Today; Maloney Working Forwards To Speed Up Offense 
### 
Card soccermen will meet P.oly
j technic high school of San Francisco
' here Saturday morning in the second
pre-season practice game before the
j regular conference schedule starts,
1 Coach Harry Maloney announced to
j day.
Both the varsity and frosh squads
! will be given a rest this afternoon
i with no turnouts for either squad,
! but Friday the varsity will be run
| through a stiff workout in prepara
j tion for Saturday's game.
| Polytechnic is generally conceded
i to be the strongest high school team
j of the '34 season. They have already
I beaten San Jose State 6-2 and lost
: to San Mateo by a lone, questionable
i goal. Maloney will use a reorganized
: first squad against the city men Sat
j urday and also as many second
I stringers as will be possible.
Maloney has been concentrating
his coaching efforts on the forward
| line this week, pointing toward a
I fast and strong offense for the first
| conference game with San Mateo
! next Wednesday.
