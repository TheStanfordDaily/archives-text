# Rooters' Tickets Bought By 1349; Sale Continues
## 
### 
Stanford's welcome to Northwest
erners when they meet Stanford in
the stadium Saturday will not be
exactly overwhelming if the number
of rooters' tickets sold, as told last
night by Don Liebendorfer, is an
indication.
But the situation can yet be reme
died. Today and tomorrow the con
tinued sale of rooters' tickets in the
lobby of the B.A.C. building from
9 to 5 o'clock will give students a
chance to add to the 1349 now
scheduled to fill the rooting section.
Forty-seven men and 17 women
laid down $1.10 for thp prized ducats
yesterday, and many more are ex
pected to join the van as game time
approaches. This will be possible as
a result of the B.A.C. extending the
ticket sale. Students failing to get
rooters' tickets can pay SI 10 and
get end-zone tickets the day of the
game.
