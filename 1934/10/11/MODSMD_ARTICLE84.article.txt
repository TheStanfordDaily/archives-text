# University Press Finds Photolithing Successful
## 
### 
Photolithing, a newer, quicker,,
and more economical method for
the reproduction in print of pub
lished matter, is now in everyday
use in the Stanford University Press.
The new machinery arrived here in
the latter part of July.
Already such important campus
publications as the Bawlout, Illus
trated Weekly, and the October
cover for Chappie have been pro
duced by photolith.
It is essentially a photographic
process, and is especially valuable
in printing additional copies of
works out of print, handwritten
messages, such as letters to the
Mother's Club, and pages of pic
torial material. The tedious lino- 1
typing, set-by-hand labor is alto
gether avoided.
Copy to be pressed, whether print,
handwriting, picture, or typewritten, [

is mounted as it will appear in proof.
Then it is placed in a camera range,
set by precision instruments to
page size. It is photographed, and
the negative chemically treated and
developed as in common snapshot
work, coming out as a dark blue
film.
From this negative is made the
plate, which differs from regular
job-printing in that it is only one
one-hundredth of an inch thick, and
will curl up around the pressing
roller. The principle here in press
ing is the repelling action of water
on greasy ink, where the water pre
cedes the ink to the roller, thus caus
ing an exact reproduction.
More than 12,000,000 acres of for
est land in this country has reverted
to public ownership through tux de
linquency in recent years.
