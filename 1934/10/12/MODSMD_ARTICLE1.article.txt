# International Ring Sought By French As Riots Continue
## Minister of Interior Sarraut Resigns after Criticism Of French Police in Protecting King Alexander; Downfall of Ministry Is Expected 
### 
I'ARIS, Oct. II (fP). —A "vast international terrorist ring" was trailed
by French secret police today as Minister of Interior Albert Sarraut re
signed after sharp criticism ol' police failure to protect Kin# Alexander at
Marseille Tuesday.
That the 10 shots Petrus Kaleman lired still echoed through Europe was
evidenced when Jugoslavs staged anti-Italian riots and French political
observers confidently predicted Premier Gaston Doumcrguc's Cabinet would
resign in mass for reorganization.

Sarraut's resignation was expected*
to be only the first of official heads
that will roll in consequence of the
tragedy.
Eleven-year-old Peter II of Jugo
slavia, accompanied by his widowed
mother, Queen Marie, left Paris for
Belgrade tonight to be crowned King
in his father's stead.
French police were firmly con
vince! an international terror outfit
was back of Alexander's assassina
tion. Officials of the Surete Natio
nals announced they were steadily
drawing the net around suspected
accomplices of Kaleman.
A chain of evidence already in the
hands of the police led them to be
lieve that they would be able to
solve the murder of the Jugoslav
king.
Men Grilled
Al Annemasse, France, police
grilled two men —Wladislav Bones
and Paroslac Novak, who said they
were born on territory then Aus
trian but now Italian —believing they
v/eic accomplices of Kaleman. The
officials said they got from them only
denials and the bare admission they
"might have met Kaleman in Paris."
At Mar.M illc lay the bruised body
of the murderer, whose death-deal
ing instrument- -a new type machine
gun pistol capable of firing 280 shots
per minute took the lives of Alex
ander, Barthou and two other per
sons and resulted in his own sum
mary execution.
Police Mystified
The real identity of the man was
still cloaked in mystery, although
the Annemasse police were con
vinced the two men they questioned
knew Kaleman and were linked with
Balkan terrorists.
Arrest of this third man, identified
as Sylvester Chalny by papers he let
fall when police seized him before,
was confidently expected this morn
ing.
