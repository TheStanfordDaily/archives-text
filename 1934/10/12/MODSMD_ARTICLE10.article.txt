# Hollywood Made Stooges Of Team, Says S. C. Daily

LOS ANGELES, Oct. 11 (JP).â€”
Characterizing some of its football
players as "toys to some henna
haired beauty or to a film magnate,"
the Daily Trojan, student publication
of the University of Southern Cali
fornia, has warned the defenders of
Troy they must shake off the Holly
wood influence if they are going to
get back in the van of the gridiron
procession.
An editorial appearing in the pa
per, written by its editor, Jack
Frankish, comments that the Tro
jans have been "wined and dined"
by the mercenary interests in the
film colony for a Ion 1 " time and that
the 10-0 defeat ' ,iered to them
last week by Vvashington State Col
lege can be traced right back to
Hollywood.
Frankish said today his editorial
was intended solely to inspire the
Trojans on to a victory over the
University of Pittsburgh this week.
"The student body is 100 per
cent for the team," Frankish said.
"I think the team realizes that,
after the sendoff it received just
before the departure for Pitts
burgh.
"What we object to is the busi
ness of movie interests getting the

I players to appear at various events
and present trophies. They toss in
a $5 watch as a reward.
j "We don't object to the men work
ing part time at the studios, either,
i I believe that if the boys will forget
I all about Hollywood they can beat
; Pittsburgh, and that's what we all
I want them to do."
! The text of the editorial follows:
"Saturday's football game marked
more than a mere victory for Wash
( ington State over Southern Califor
nia. Jt marked, instead, the victory
1 of a team which plays football for the
j game's sake over a team of Holly
wood-struck boys who once knew
j how to play football, buL having been
persuaded that they are already All-
Americans, now only go through the
j motions.
"For several years Trojan football
! players have been idols in the eyes
of the mercenary population of Hol
lywood. Rather the Trojans thought
they were idols, though actually they
were as toys to some henna-haired
beauty or to a film magnate. They
1 were wined and dined and made to
feel the world was theirs, when they
were really just pawns in the grip
; of those wishing to further their own
1 interests."
