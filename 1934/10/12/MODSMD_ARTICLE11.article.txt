# Get-Acquainted Teas Planned Today by " Y"
## 
### 
The "Y" rooms on the third floor
of the Women's Clubhouse will be
the scene of two "get-acquainted"
teas to be given by the Y.W.C.A. for
new lower division women today
from 3 until 6 o'clock and for new
upper division women on Sunday
during the same hours.
At the teas, the new women will
find out in what interest groups of
the organization they would most
care to participate, and they will also
become acquainted with the mem
bers and officers of the "Y" and its
secretary, Elizabeth Lam.
If any woman finds that she can
not go to the tea which is especially
for her class, she is welcome to at
tend the other. Vivian Kay, with
Betty Reynolds and Winifred Man
ning assisting her, will be in charge
of the teas.
