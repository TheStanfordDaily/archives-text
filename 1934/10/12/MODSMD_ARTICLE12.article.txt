# Stanford Daily, 1914-34, Exhibited in Library
## 
### 
On the second floor of the Library,
sandwiched in between the pictures
of the leaders of Stanford in 1916
and the flashy red and yellow Chap
pie exhibit, is a simple but telling
display of the Stanford Daily as she
was and is.
The older of the two copies, that
of September 1, 1914. bears the origi
nal name, the Daily Palo Alto
(changcd to the present name in
1925). The big story of the issue
deals with the change of personnel
on the Board of Trustees, with vital
war news of the day, a tennis team
story coming in second. A contrast
to this is a copy of the first issue
of this volume. Bigger, containing
more news, it shows the Daily's great
progress since those not-so-distant
days.
