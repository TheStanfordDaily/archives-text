# Roth Mountain Hideaway Completed After Eleven Years of Improvement
## 
### John McClelland 
Io 1923 Stanford's Comptroller
Almon E. Roth visualized a hide
away in the hills where he could
get away from his eternally ringing
telephone and his endless line of
callers. In 1934 he has his mountain
hideaway. And every stone, log and
shingle of it he has cut and laid
with his own hands.
For 11 years Mr. Roth has stolen
away from the University on Sun
days and vacations to an isolated spot
42 miles south of Stanford in the
Santa Cruz mountains. There, single
handed, he has cleared a tract, built
a rustic summer home, a guest
cabin, outside sleeping quarters and
a stream with fish pools. It has been
a hobby extraordinary. And for a 1
man as busy as Mr. Roth, the whole j
project may well qualify as a task j
of truly stupenduous proportions.
Home Now Complete
Although there are still several last
details yet to be finished up, the
Comptroller now pronounced his
summer "hideaway" complete. He
has a spacious log cabin with living |
room, dining room, kitchen, bath j
room and sleeping attic; a separate j
guest cabin with a trick roof which '
can be raised to expose the interior [
(,) the open air al night; an artificial j
stream with step-down fish pools,
and two open air sleeping quarters.
In the beginning, 11 years ago, Mr. j

| Roth spent the first few visits L(
i his mountain haven in clearing i
tract of land.
Cites Record
His record was: first year, trees
i felled and excavating done; seconc
year, floor laid; third year, walls pui
! up; fourth year, roof put on; fifth
year, chimney built; sixth year, fire
place finished.
By the end of that sixth year the
| hideaway was beginning to look like
a real home. Then for the next five
: years holidays and Sundays were
I spent in working on the grounds,
building the artificial stream, the
guest cabin and the sleeping quar
ters.
With the exception of a little help
from friends and his family tin
Comptroller did every bit of I he
work. And he also designed I he
whole project without aid. This de
signing, he confesses, was done
mostly on the trips to and from the
mountain home and at such odd
times as cross-country train trips.
Stairs Featured
The main cabin itself is built of
hewn logs with a shake roof. The
features of the interior are stairs
cut from a single great log and a
dining room table made of curly
redwood planks polished to a glass
like sheen.
In the guest cabin is ;i roof which
any architect might well be proud

i of designing. It is built on the same
principle as a cantilever bridge and
can be pushed readily aside to leave
the cabin open to the air at night.
Down the hill at one side of the
cabins flows a stream which Mr. Roth
created by directing the water from
a spring higher up in the hills. The
bed of the stream and the fish pools
have been made of concrete but so
covered over with stones and moss
that the appearance is entirely
natural.
Bark Covering Made
To the rear and above the main
cabin are two circular sleeping quar
ters. These structures are covered
with bark so as to resemble giant
stumps. They have no covering.
In the grounds around the build
ings are great, growths of native
ferns. A complete collection of Aus
tralian ferns is coming to be planted
with the others.
The only lumber in the entire set
of structures is in the floors. And
even now Mr. Roth is designing a
new kind of wooden mosaic floor
to be built of log blocks.
During the eleven years that the
Comptroller has been working at his
hobby many persons have come to
view and wonder. Slyly Mr. Roth
admits there have been four Stan
ford honeymooners at his hideaway,
but that they did not contribute
greatly to the work done.

away from the University on Sun
days and vacations to an isolated spot
42 miles south of Stanford in the
Santa Cruz mountains. There, single
handed, he has cleared a tract, built
a rustic summer home, a guest
cabin, outside sleeping quarters and
a stream with fish pools. It has been
a hobby extraordinary. And for a 1
man as busy as Mr. Roth, the whole j
project may well qualify as a task j
of truly stupenduous proportions.
Home Now Complete
Although there are still several last
details yet to be finished up, the
Comptroller now pronounced his
summer "hideaway" complete. He
has a spacious log cabin with living |
room, dining room, kitchen, bath j
room and sleeping attic; a separate j
guest cabin with a trick roof which '
can be raised to expose the interior [
(,) the open air al night; an artificial j
stream with step-down fish pools,
and two open air sleeping quarters.
In the beginning, 11 years ago, Mr. j

| Roth spent the first few visits L(
i his mountain haven in clearing i
tract of land.
Cites Record
His record was: first year, trees
i felled and excavating done; seconc
year, floor laid; third year, walls pui
! up; fourth year, roof put on; fifth
year, chimney built; sixth year, fire
place finished.
By the end of that sixth year the
| hideaway was beginning to look like
a real home. Then for the next five
: years holidays and Sundays were
I spent in working on the grounds,
building the artificial stream, the
guest cabin and the sleeping quar
ters.
With the exception of a little help
from friends and his family tin
Comptroller did every bit of I he
work. And he also designed I he
whole project without aid. This de
signing, he confesses, was done
mostly on the trips to and from the
mountain home and at such odd
times as cross-country train trips.
Stairs Featured
The main cabin itself is built of
hewn logs with a shake roof. The
features of the interior are stairs
cut from a single great log and a
dining room table made of curly
redwood planks polished to a glass
like sheen.
In the guest cabin is ;i roof which
any architect might well be proud

i of designing. It is built on the same
principle as a cantilever bridge and
can be pushed readily aside to leave
the cabin open to the air at night.
Down the hill at one side of the
cabins flows a stream which Mr. Roth
created by directing the water from
a spring higher up in the hills. The
bed of the stream and the fish pools
have been made of concrete but so
covered over with stones and moss
that the appearance is entirely
natural.
Bark Covering Made
To the rear and above the main
cabin are two circular sleeping quar
ters. These structures are covered
with bark so as to resemble giant
stumps. They have no covering.
In the grounds around the build
ings are great, growths of native
ferns. A complete collection of Aus
tralian ferns is coming to be planted
with the others.
The only lumber in the entire set
of structures is in the floors. And
even now Mr. Roth is designing a
new kind of wooden mosaic floor
to be built of log blocks.
During the eleven years that the
Comptroller has been working at his
hobby many persons have come to
view and wonder. Slyly Mr. Roth
admits there have been four Stan
ford honeymooners at his hideaway,
but that they did not contribute
greatly to the work done.
