# Frosh Push Many Sophs Into Slime
## "To Hell with '37" Heard At End of Battle 
### 
i 1
In spite of the four stalwart sophs
who took the field ahead of their
class, and dared several hundred
members of '38 grouped at the far
end of the frosh field to try to beat
them, the freshmen emerged at the
end of 20 mud-filled minutes the
new champions and the victors over
the sophs by a score of 110 to 50 in
their annual fight yesterday.
After waiting for some time for
the sophs to appear, the frosh booed
loudly the four horsemen when they
appeared, and appeared more ex
cited than ever when the familiar
"to hell with '38" was -heard coming
from the direction of the R.O.T.C.
stables.
Triolo Begins
As soon as the class of '37 had
taken the field, in various assort
ments of undress, master of cere
monies Jimmy Triolo gave the signal
for the brawl to commence. The
audience, including a number of co
eds whose lady-like instincts were
forgotten for the moment, ducked
the flying mud and cheered as va
rious members of each class found
themselves in the pools of mud in
each end of the field.
After 10 minutes of free-for-all
warfare, a stalemate in the battle
threatened as the two sides lined up
opposite each other and seemed to
be waiting for the whistle to blow.
A short pep talk from Triolo started
things going again, and by the end of
15 minutes the height of the fighting
was reached.
Was My Face Red
Faces of members of the fair sex
turned a sudden red as combatants
on all sides of the field began to find
themselves the victims of undue ex
posure.
At the end of 20 minutes Triolo
dared to set foot in no-man's land
and quiet the battle—to declare that
the sophs had been badly beaten.
As the underclassmen sought show
ers and clothes, "to hell with '37"
was the yell heard most.
