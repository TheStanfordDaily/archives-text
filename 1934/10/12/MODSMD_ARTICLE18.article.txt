# Cards Favored In Tomorrow's Clash With Nortwestern
## Dick Hanley Promises Wide-Open, Spectacular Play In First Intersectional Contest of Year; Grayson Will Not Start 
### MILLARD BROWNE 
A wide-open, spectacular game, an evil-intending group of Wildcats j
favored at least psychologically, and eleven Stanford football players who
must be near-perfect in condition and precision.
These are three of the things promised by ballyhoo agents on the eve
of intersectional gridiron combat between Tiny Thornhill's Indians and
Dick Ilanlcy's Wildcats from Evanston, 111.

But try as they may, the artists
of galT could not help letting out tin;
fact that the Cardinal is favored, !
fairly heavily, to stop the invaders of j
Stanford Stadium tomorrow, and to
complete successfully a drive or two
of its own.
Ballyhoo point number one, a
spectacular game is not only prob
able, but it is assured, and "y° ur
correspondent" is inclined to agree
with Sylvestre Drofnats, that mon
strosity of grid prognostication, in
saying that both teams have a bet
ter than average chance of scoring
tomorrow.
In the event that Northwestern
comes through with a touch
down, it is highly probable that
crossing of the pay-line will be
directly or indirectly the result of
forward passing.
Stanford also has an aerial trick or
two, but the Indians have the addi -
tional advantage of a strong, smooth
running attack.
Just how smooth that attack is will
be of particular interest to Coach
Thornhill for the reason that it will
be run without the spark that has
ignited it in previous games, Fullback
Bobby Grayson.
Grayson definitely will not start,
and it is almost as certainly under
stood that he will not play at all,
an announcement made last night
indicated.
Right at this point, just before a
series of games including U.S.F.,
Southern California, U.C.L.A., and
Washington on consecutive week
ends, Tiny is more than a little con
cerned with the possibilities of his
team clicking without that spark,
which has been so important in
games to date.
They grow 'em tough up Chicago
way, and Northwestern is "up Chi
cago way." The Wildcats, further
more, do not like the idea of people
saying they aren't as good as Stan
ford. They will enter the game with
a clear case of mayhem in their
hearts. And insomuch as Stanford
does not mind playing rough when
called upon, a nasty game of foot
ball may be on the afternoon's pro
gram.
So Stanford will have a smooth
functioning offense and an impen
etrable defense, or else— the "or
else" referring to (letting odds 011
succeeding Cardinal games this
year.
Summing it all up, Stanford should
beat Northwestern. But there are
factors that may easily upset this
figuring. In the first place the Wild
cats are good defensively, and they
will fight Indian scoring attempts
with a vengeance. Last year they
managed a 0 to 0 tie, and that kind
of a score would not be impossible
tomorrow.
Furthermore, with lliis strong
defense aiding them, the tougliies
from Evanston will open the air
way fireworks early, and if one of
these early passes should connect
for a touchdown, Stanford may
find it difficult to regain six or
seven points, to say nothing of two
touchdowns which would be nec
essary for actual victory.
If things go right, and if Grayson
is not missed too much Stanford
should score three touchdowns. But
this is more of a Utopian dream than
a promise.
Thornhill grilled his first string in
defense of Northwestern plays at
practice yesterday, and he will com
plete workouts with a brief running
of signals and limbering up this
afternoon.
Stanford's starting line-up is de
termined, with the exception of the
center position. Thornhill said last
night it was still a toss-up for pivot
honors between Wes Muller and
Niel.s Larsen. Larsen, however, ha
been working out with the fir t
string in practice during the last
two days.
Bones Hamilton will go in at full
back in place of Grayson, and Gor
don Head will take over Hamilton',
right halfback work.
