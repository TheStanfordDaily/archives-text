Pan-Hellenic, as lon# us any Stanford man
of eniTent vintage can remember, lias always
had ;i tough time. It's either been a case of
too many rules or too many useless rules.
Kit her one is had enough.
Stealing the spotlight again at the outset
of its regular seasonal butchery, Pan-Hell has
decided lots of things about lots of things.
The basic idea seems to favor "more normal
contact" between the bewildered freshman
and the Row woman, .lust what that phrase
might mean has never been quite determined.
Aiming at a nice, pleasant, all-around
friendly altitude in order that the potential
pledgling will become perhaps just a bit be
wildered and slightly awed at the privilege,
Pan-Hell has arrived at the startling conclu
sion that How women can talk to attractive
freshmen while on the Quad, and even may
walk as great a distance as that between the
Engineering corner and the post olTice. Hut
beyond the limits of the pale, danger! Beware.
Of course, stipulations complicate matters
whereby How women may be "normal" within
the above limits, but they are told that to
"take a freshman to the Cellar or to the li
brary" would be much too much. Heallv, now.
Pity the Hoble lass who can't quite decide
what it is all about. Now she can, now she
can't. And it isn't a joyous game, either. For,
in the end, when all is done, and sororities
have finished the tedious task of "cutting" the
lists which they have already begun (Yes,
young lady, your actions are being watched
even now. Anything you say or do can be
used against you. If you think, do it quietly),
only a tiny percentage of the numerous "hall"
women can possibly be pledged.
II that is "normalcy," and not a game of
hide-and-seek, there is plenty of fun to come.
