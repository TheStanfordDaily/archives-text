# A 						Decadent Tradition

### 
One notes wilh surprise that that hitherto
rather sophomoric institution to the south,
known as the I Diversity of Southern Califor
nia, lias turned over a new leaf and is now
making an elTort to abolish hazing.
Stanford can note wilh pardonable pride
that the practice of hazing and otherwise mis
treating innocent freshmen lias long since
been dispensed with here. S.C. is to be con
gratulated upon the banning of a cruel and
outdated custom. Though traces of the prac
tice still persist and may continue to do so,
its eventual eradication is assured by Presi
dent von KlcinStnid's order.
S.C.'s new regulation is supposed to apply
to classes and social fraternities alike. If haz
ing within the fraternities can be eliminated,
a difficult objective, then the Trojans will be
well ahead of Stanford in the march toward
civilization.
Last spring the Interl raterni tv Council
changed the name of "Hell Week" to»"Prc-
Initiation Period" and provided that the ac
tivities of that period "shall not interfere with
scholarship or with property, or the peace
and quiet of any other person or group ol
persons."
■{Such action represented a step in the right
direction but it was only a step. As everyone
knows, the so-called "Pie-Initiation Period"
lias already begun in many fraternities, ac
companied by most of the quaint customs
that have always distinguished this playful
period. That, ol course, is the fraternities'
legal right, the Interfralernity Moan I ruling
having nothing to do with what goes on within
the i n d i vidua I houses.
The elimination of such useless and out
moded foldcrol can only be accomplished by

the individual action of each house. Like the
once popular custom of firing cannon through
professors' windows, observed in the earlier
days of American education, "Hell Week"
must and wiil go eventually.
Few will mourn its passing should it occur
! in the verv near future.
