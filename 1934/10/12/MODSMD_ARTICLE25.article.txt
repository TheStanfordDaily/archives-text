This week the honor system went into the
discard at Tulane University, carrying a .">()-
year service record with it. Students had
voted 2-1 for retention of the system, hut
forced hv lack of co-operation from these
j same students, the faculty had no alternative
hut abolition.
The failure is unfortunate hut it serves
, Stanford with a timely warning. We have
: the honor system, and are deservedly proud
1 of our maintenance of it; its scrupulous ob
servance is the best insurance of its retention.
Last year passed comfortably in this re
! gard. There were no serious Honor Code
troubles, nor are any expected in the future.
However, remembering the mass of new and
untried students, a program designed to ac
quaint them with our Honor Code ideals
! might not be amiss at the moment.
Now we learn that "Hitler Over Europe,"
latest literary splash, is sold only in the lic
! tion department of bookstores.
