### BOB JONES 
SHREWD SECRETARY OF COMMERCE ROPER

Washington's sultry, stifling summer weather makes
the typical office in the nation's capital most unattrac
tive for work. Far above the average run of stuffy
offices, though, are those in the new, massive, partly
air-cooled Commerce building.
Housed in this most modern of governmental struc
tures was loud, much-abused N.R.A. headquarters with
its high potentate and mogul, General Johnson. Sitting
quietly above, overseeing the entire department while
the General thunders and storms several floors below,
I found Daniel C. Roper, Secretary of Commerce.
A trained politician and public servant, a conserva
tive with such flexibility that he seems to get along well
with fellow cabinet members belonging to the "liberal"
school, Roper is a most interesting and enjoyable
contrast to noisy Johnson. Placid and agreeable, "Mr.
Secretary" is a shrewd-looking, medium-sized, typical
administrator.
Mr. Roper oversees the department in a large, rec
tangular-shaped, wood-paneled room. A few selected
pictures hang on the walls. His desk is at the further
end.
Though his department is one of the most important
as far as the common man is concerned. Roper is
a person people know littie about; he has not been
sharply sketched in the popular imagination. Yet he
is rated as one of the country's best and shrewdest
politicians.
Calmly striking out at opponents who would place
him in a class with "brain trusters who have nothing
but theories" and who pay little attention to "business
sense," Roper flayed those who would call him one
of those "New Deal professors." He said that he
has weekly and sometimes daily conferences with the
nation's leading business leaders, listening to the busi
ness man's side of the question. He is an expert in
that calling of politics.
Roper recounted a recent day he had spent in
visiting the campus of an Eastern university. He cen
sured the average college man, after a day's experience
on the campus, for the complete absence of a planned
day every day. "Mr. Secretary" urged students to have
a "thought a day," a planned and budgeted program.
He blamed the average college man for not getting
ahead as rapidly as he might because of his'faulty tac
tics in meeting men. "The individual," he claimed,
"should meet a man in an understanding manner, with
confidence and without antagonism, and with a marked
appreciation for what the man has to offer."
Coming back to the cause of the common man:
"The test of a government," he said, "is the treat
ment of the mass."
Away from Herbert Hoover's Commerce building we
go Monday to the new Post-office layout to meet
"Big Jim" Farley.
