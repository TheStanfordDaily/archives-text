### CHARLOTTE BURRIDGE 
WITH HAROLD H. FISHER

Jugoslavia is still furnishing the newspapers with
front page material. Developments late yesterday in
dicate that there is going to be more of a follow-up to
the assassination than just letters of sympathy. Har
old H. Fisher, lecturer in history and former journalist
on the staff of the New Republic and Washington (D.C.)
Herald, considers the situation very favorable for
serious international complications.
Before arrival of news from the Jugoslav center,
Fisher had said that there was "a strong possibility
that an actual Croatian revolt might be caused," and
that in such a case there was "great danger that the
Croatians in their exuberance would kill off some
Italians since there are many in that section.
"If such a conflict were to develop, he predicted,
the situation might cause serious resentment and lead
to Italy's intervening on the other side of the Adriatic."
Since the historian's statement yesterday afternoon,
his prediction has come true and the Croatians have
attacked groups of Italians. Now tie believes that there
may he added activity on the part of Hungary or
Bulgaria in an effort to get back territory of which
tlicy believe themselves unduly deprived since the
World War.
Fisher is not a member of the group that believes
war in Europe impossible at present because of finan
cial and economic conditions.
"No country ever .stayed out of a war because of
finances," he said. "At the present time the power in
Europe is all one-sided with France al the head. Be
fore the World War, the Triple Entente and Triple
Alliance had powers equally divided. Now there is no
such balance and lines are not so distinctly drawn
between two groups.
"Just because the World War followed the murder
of an archduke doesn't mean that a war will follow the
murder of every important person in Europe. So many
Serbian assassinations have not resulted in war but
have caused a drastic change in Serbian policy."
Commenting on Germany's probable role in the
European drama, the history lecturer said: "l( wouldn't
affect Germany unless there would he a break-up of
Jugoslavia and Germany could lake more territory.
People predict such things mainly because they don't
like the German policy, but I don't think one ran judge
so far ahead of an event."
it would seem, however, from his forecast yesterday,
that Fisher is capable of judging ahead of an event.
