A CAII FOR EVERY GARAGE
AND VICE VERSA

Now we are in favor of an ex
tended public works program. Men j
are unemployed, and in the absence
of real jobs, public works are emer- i
gency's only expedient. But we do
not choose to dignify the process of
having men dig holes, so that other j
men may fill them up again, by the
high-sounding title of "public!
works." That is simply public did
dling, and no amount of brass bands ]
or leather lungs can make the matter j
smell less foul.

We believe that direct relief is far
preferable, and less demoralizing
than ill-planned and misdirected I
governmental building projects. In i
the matter of building, as in all else, j
common sense is a fundamental ne- j
cessity. Otherwise, a building pro-1
gram — like astrology — becomes a
mania, and not a science.
Now my Republican friends and
a few Democrats will nod their heads
approvingly, and say that this is all
very true. But Stanford has also
had a public works program. It has
involved the expenditure of around
$600,000. While the building spree
was on, Stanford women were given
a half million dollar palace—which
may or may not be all right, de
pending on how you look at Stan
ford women; at any rate Stanford
women profit by the expenditure,
and as they will probably pay for
their pleasure—Lagunita for the mo
ment is a matter for feminine con
templation.

But the Cellar's "APPENDIX" is
another matter. To sink over
$20,000 of student money — money
that should go towards the reduc
tion of Union food prices—into that
delightful little hole is not very
pleasing to the Stanford student
body. Noon is the only time when
the "APPENDIX" resembles any
thing but the desolation of Grant's
tomb. But at the luncheon hour, the
Union Alcove (upstairs) is for the j
most part deserted; and could well
accommodate Cellar overflow, if the
Alcove were made attractive to
student diners.
What many people believe is as ;
gi-eat an error of omission as the
"APPENDIX" was an error of com
mission, was the failure of Stanford's
building program to include a small
appropriation to provide garages for
the three men's dormitories — En-j
eina, Toyon, and Branner. A few
years ago there was a popular slo
gan: "A chicken in every pot, and j
two cars in every garage." But now
that Stanford hall men have the j
chickens, and the cars—the garages j
are sadly lacking. There are nu- !
merous men in the halls who would
gladly pay a nominal monthly sum |
for garages near the halLs. And
the garages would be more profit
able to the University than the
"APPENDIX," or the Union, or the
Bookstore.
Now we feel much better.
