| CRIME WITHOUT PASSION
i At the Varsity
"Crime Without Passion" is an in
teresting picture by Messrs. Hecht
! and Mac Arthur, two gentlemen who,
though wise in the ways of the

stage, have had
no previous ex
perience in pro
ducing motion
pictures. They
have been ably
assisted by one
Lee Garmes,
who, if not the

| best cameraman in the business, is
! certainly one of the masters.
"Crime Without Passion" is a dif
ferent picture. The team of Hecht
| and Mac Arthur, unbound by cine
■ matic tradition, have bi'ought to their
1 work a freshness of viewpoint and
i freedom which has enabled them to
I produce a truly excellent picture.
; To say that this is the only produc
| tion ever to achieve the full possi
bilities of the cinema would be a
j gross injustice to several others I
• can think of, but it is certainly one
of the few.
This is a picture which tells as
much of character as of story. While
it does not lag in pace, it does put
j the main emphasis upon impression
j rather than narration, perhaps be
j cause the plot is just a wee mite
j trite. But don't go to see the story,
j go for the cinematic excellence and
; the new interpretive style.
i Fully half the credit for this pic
! ture should go to Garmes for his
■ lens work. In ordinary pictures the
camera is used in place of the ob
\ server's eye: it merely records what
goes on. But in "Crime Without
Passion" the camera records what it
wants the observer to FEEL. Camera
i work does as much as acting in
| showing up character.
