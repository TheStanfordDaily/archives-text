# World Need Of Control Now Great
## Invitational Adjustment Vitalâ€”Condliffe 
### 
Advocating the international con
trol and adjustment of clashing na
tional policies, Dr. John B. Condliffe
last night lectured on "International
Economic and Financial Equilib
rium" in the Little Theatre, spon
sored by the Committee on Public
Exercises.
Dr. Condliffe, member of the Eco
nomic Intelligence Service of the
League of Nations, is returning to
Geneva from his home in New
Zealand.
Urges Action
Describing the present policy of
nations which are attempting to
"insulate" themselves from the fluc
tuation of the outside world as
"flights from reality" and "barriers
to progress," Dr. Condliffe urged in
ternational action in the solution oi
financial and economic problems.
League Yet Active
Dr. Condliffe corrected the im
pression held by a number of people
that the League of Nations is only a
political and diplomatic organiza
tion, now rather broken down and
decrepit. He pointed out its tre
mendous activity in the fields of
health, opium traffic control, river
and railway communication, and fi
nance, particularly in its aid to bank
rupt countries.
Dr. Condliffe will lecture further
on the same subject at 4:15 o'clock
Monday in the Little Theatre. At
that time he will discuss the present
monetary situation and its develop
ment since the failure of the Lon
don conference, estimating the ex
tent of recovery since 1932 and the
check to recovery in the summer of
1934.
