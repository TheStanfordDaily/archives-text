THE THEATER IN NEW YORK: ;
I. The Season Opens
(Continued from yesterday
j Of other exhibits on Broadway: |
The Red Cat is a shoddy successor to
! The Guardsman. Although it pos-1
| sesses moderately amusing risque
! moments in the third act, these mo
! ments ai*e too forced to be thoroughly '
I entertaining and too few to sustain
! the play even as a success de scan
j dal. First Episode, tastelessly re-,
1 titled College Sinners, is an occa
j sionally moving but, on the whole, I
I spurious depiction of undergraduate
] existence among the looser-Oxon-
I ians, and destined to short life. The
authors have been unable to sheer
| away from the temptations of exag
geration and melodrama, with the
j result that the tone of the play varies, i
| to the despair of the actors and of
I the audience as well.
i Too Many Boats (R:I:P.) was a
j tawdry melodrama, graced use
j lessly by the sturdy talents of Earl
, Larimore, which concerned itself
with low life among the war-time;
j soldiery of the Philippines. Seven
performances. Lady Jane, another
j importation, concerns itself with
! cockoldry among placid and polite
English countryfolk. H. M. Har-1
! wood, the author, has given it un
! even direction with, perhaps, the in
' tention of adding life to it. Not get
i ting the co-operation of Francis;
Starr, whose performance is quite
colorless, he is aided only by Reg
-1 inald Mason, who makes a warm j
character with his dozen or so lines,,
! which may be recalled despite the
| shouting hysterics of the remainder
| of the castâ€”except the too-calm Miss '
! Starr.
This is the extent of my theater
going to date; Elmer Rice's melo
drama Judgment Day is the only one
; of the other shows which seems to
! be enjoying a prosperous existence,
i with the exception of a revue, Life
Begins at 8:40, the first of the sea- j
j son's musical shows to win approval.
There are a number of interesting
shows in rehearsal; but these will,
! perforce, wait for a future report.
