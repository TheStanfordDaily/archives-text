The Editor, Sir:
I am sure lhat many readers were
yesterday gratified to learn, from
the editor's note at the foot of the
account of the Nome lire, that Mi.ss
Louise Harlan, the writer of the ar
ticle. "escaped the fire which razed
the town,"
Surprising! Because, you know, if
the editor hadn't so kindly explained,
most people would have been sure
to suspect a ghost had written the
account! One can only suppose the
learned editor meant "missed" in
stead of "escaped,"
This is not written with any mali
cious motive but solely out of ad
miration for unintentional editorial
humor.

Washington Irving once described
himself as "the obscurest man of
letters in America."
