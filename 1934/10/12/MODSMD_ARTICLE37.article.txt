# FALL TRACKSTERS BEGIN WORKOUTS WITH TIME TRIAL
## Klopstock in Good Shape; Scholastic Difficulties Eliminate Evans 
### 
Fall track is already in full swing
—more so than it has been for the
past several years. Coach Dink Tem
pleton has run his boys through
time trials already once this week,
the second of the season, and may
time them again, this afternoon.
Sam Klopstock, who was not seri
ously hurt in an auto accident this
summer as previously reported, is
on the track again after taking the
measure of all of the Eastern greats.
He is going easy, striding and a few
hurdles, but will probably be cutting
under 15 seconds in the highs with
in a month.
Evans Lost
Sam will be without the backing of
Irwin Evans, the '37 frosli hurdler,
who was forced to leave due to
scholastic difficulties. Evans v\as a
great prospect, possessing a tall,
strong build, and had speed enough
to race Gus Meier stride for stride
for 100 yards.
Johnny Mottram will be out, prob
ably for two or three nights a week
this fall. The new world's record of
over 251 feet, set by the remarkable
Finn, Matti Jarvinen, is more or
less out of reach of any present day
normal United States citizen, but
Johnny will be out to better his own
personal mark of 221 feet and gather
points in big meets in the spring.
Javelin Promising
Dud Sales and Bill Bcatty, come
through performers in the U.S.C. and
Cal meets last year, are seniors who
may eclipse the 200-foot mark any
time they can remember all the
points javelin tossers must remem
ber. Kay Williamson, at present out
with food poisoning, and Jack Curl
son, both sophs, will make the spear
event unusually strong.
