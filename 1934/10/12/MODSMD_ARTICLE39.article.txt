## 
### 
After waiting for Stanford to
get a week's start on him, Law
son Little, Stanford's interna
tional golf champion, appeared
yesterday and started his stud
ies. Feared as lost or waylaid
for the first week, Little's re
turn was very apparent to his
fraternity brothers who com
plained of the excess of camera
men in the vicinity of the Chi
Psi lodge.
At the golf course Little
showed that he had lost none
of his prowess that won him
international fame. On the first
nine holes he scored an even
par though he had two penalty
strokes on that side.
