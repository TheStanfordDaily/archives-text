# Economics Stir Cubans Says Professor Martin
## 
### Cedric Larson 
"Cuba's difficultics are economic
J and not political," is the conclusion
I reached by Dr. Percy Alviti Martin,
I professor of Latin American history
! at Stanford, after some time spent
j on. the island republic this summer.
Dr. Martin believes that the eco
j nomic skies of Cuba are brighten
■ ing, due to the abrogation of the
Piatt amendment, and the recently
signed trade agreement between the
United States and the Caribbean re
public, which fixes a definite price
on sugar.
The Stanford professor spent most
of his time in Cuba in conferences
and interviews, among which were
talks with forme/presidents de Ces
pedes and Grau San Martin, the
latter the one who fled to Florida
a short time ago.
Before going to Cuba, Dr. Martin
j delivered a series of lectures at mid
| western universities, and George
! Washington* University at Washing
ton, D.C. His Washington

University lectures are to be pub
lished this fall.
Leaving Cuba, Dr. Martin visited
other points in the Caribbean and
South. America: Puerto Rico, and
Cartagena and" Barenquilla, Colom
bia. Next he stopped in Panama and
San Salvador.
Proceeding northward, he spent
two weeks in Guatemala, studying
the political situation, and the cul
ture of the Maya Indians who com
prise two-thirds of the population
of Guatemala. Dr. Martin reports
these Indians have changed their
ways astonishingly little since the
days of the conquest.
