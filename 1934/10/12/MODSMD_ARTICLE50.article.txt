## Efficient Service Provided By Commissary Plan

(Editor's Note: This is the second
of a series of articles on the Stan
ford Wholesale Commissary, de
scribing to the student body the
history, present organization, and
benefits of the largest student ac
tivity. The last article will appear
in Monday's Daily.)
When the first five-year con
tracts of the Co-op—officially known
iis the Stanford Wholesale Commis
sary—expired last June, consider
able reorganization was necessary
before the second period could be
started this fall.
For a time abandonment of the
Co-op and the absorption by the
members of the $5,000 debt due the
University was considered. After a
careful consideration of all the bene
fits and disadvantages encountered
during the first trial period, how
ever, it was decided to revise the
constitution, and sign five-year con
tracts for the continuation of the
services of the Co-op.
Sororities Withdraw
Three sororities withdrew from
the organization last June, leaving
six sororities, 22 of the 24 frater
nities, and two eating clubs as mem
bers.
The most important change in the
Co-op under the new constitution is
in the organization of the board of
directors. Instead of the small group
of seven, the board now consists of
a representative, preferably the man
ager, of each member organization,
one faculty member, and one alum
nus, both of the latter appointed by
the comptroller of the University.
The enlarged board was organ
ized in order to give each member
an active voice in the responsibility
of the management of the Co-op.
David L. Faville, professor of mar
keting in the Graduate School of
Business, is the present faculty mem
ber, and L. H. Anderson, building
inspector in Palo Alto, is the alumni
member.
Officers Listed
The officers include a president.,
vice-president, and secretary, all
elected by the students on the board,
and a manager appointed by the
comptroller. Gordon Mallatratt is
this year's president, and Elliott
Ayres continues his duties as man
ager. Comptroller Almon E. Roth
and Assistant Comptroller Ernest
Erwin act as advisors to the Co-op.
Ayers has for the first time this
year dropped the title of manager of
men's dormitories, which has been
only a nominal title during the past
few years, since he has devoted his
entire time to the Co-op.
The manager, one assistant, a
butcher, and two delivery boys con
stitute the entire paid staff of the
Co-op. All student offices are vol
untary, and the University continues
to show its interest by loaning work
ing capital and providing storage
space in Branner basement.
In their capacity as directors, the
members assume the responsibility
of determining the policy, the amount
of mark-up in price, and considering
ail problems that arise. All of this
business is transacted at a regular
monthly meeting.
Members are required to buy
meats, canned goods, groceries, and
dairy products exclusively from the
Co-op. A variety of vegetables are
handled also, and may be bought
from the Co-op at the option of the
members. No non-member may take
advantage of any of the low prices
offered without joining and signing
the entire constitution.
In the past criticism of the rates
at the Co-op have been made, but
the fact that all equipment has been
installed and paid for during the first
period is pointed to as an indication
that overhead expenses will be con
siderably lowered during the coming
years, and lower rates may be ex
pected as a result.
(A more complete discussion of
the advantages and disadvantages of
the Co-op that have arisen during
the first five years of its existence
will be contained in the last article
of this series, which will appear in
Monday's Daily.)
