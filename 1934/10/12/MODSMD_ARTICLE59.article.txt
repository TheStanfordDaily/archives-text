EVERYONE AFTER
ROSE BOWL HID
The season is yet young, and the
Pacific Coast has many self-ap
pointed representatives for the Rose
Bowl game in Pasadena on New
Year's Day.
Upsets galore have failed to com
pletely oust any of the major teams
from consideration, but they have
added a few from the minor leagues.
The two surprises are the Univer
sity of Oregon and Washington State
College. On the basis of one game
each against first class competition,
these two have come from a pre
season obscurity to be considered
almost equally with any of the other
better known candidates.
Washington State last week de
feated U.S.C., 19 to 0, for one of
the Trojans' worst trouneings' in the
present decade, and thereby installed
herself as distinctly a threat to the
conference title as well as the Pasa
dena bid.
The Cougars .have what is com
monly called a breather schedule,
but they will meet St. Mary's late
in the program, and should Babe
Hollingberry's squad add the Gaels
l<> its list of conquests without
mishap in one of the easier games,
il will be hard to discard the Pull
man group from consideration.
There was no logical reason for
taking Oregon, co-champions of the
coast conference with Stanford and
U.S.C., as lightly as the Webfeet
were taken before the schedule
opened. But the northerners were
considered only fair, and their 26-3
trimming of U.C.L.A. came as a
surprise.
OREOON PROGRAM
TOUGH ENOUGH
Oregon will run up against enough
trouble in Washington, U.S.C.. St.
Mary's, and Oregon State to be a
strong contender for the Rose'Jiowl
should she get by these humps.
The University of Washington is
still undefeated, but this team will
have trouble winning any one of
five important games—with Wash
ington State, Oregon, Stanford,
California, and U.S.C. So unless
developments in the future war
rant it, the Huskies will not be
considered very seriously as Rose
Bowl material.
That covers the Northwest's
chances of being represented against
the pride of the East.
But ihere are fully five possi
bilities in California. Stanford still
heads this list, in spite of the fact
that Tiny Thornhill's Indians drew
but a tie with Santa Clara two weeks
ago.
California is so certain of par- |
ticipation in the Pasadena classic
that students and alumni alike are
already laying aside money to
cover Rose Bowl seats.
However, odds at this stage in the
season are strongly against the
Bears, particularly since the un.suc- i
cessful Berkeley invasion by St. j
Mary's.
Although not counting their ream i
completely out, U.S.C. fans are!
lapidly losing hopes of seeing El!
Trojan in next year's Tournament ]
of Roses.
SAINTS, BRONCOS
TO BE CONSIDERED
The other two teams that are still
cherishing ideas of New Year's Day j
football are St. Mary's and Santa j
Clara. Both are undefeated, and there !
i ; a possibility that they will settle j
things when they meet in their an- |
nual big game.
The Saints showed themselves to ;
be in the race by calmly defeating,
a powerful California eleven last j
week, and Santa Clara has .shown i
strength against both Stanford . and i
San Francisco University.
