# FROSH TO USE PASS OFFENSE
## 
### 
Passing galore will probably be the
chief fare to satisfy those who gulp
down an early lunch and bolt out to
the stadium to see the Freshman -
San Jose State Frosh struggle at
12:30 o'clock tomorrow. Papooses
will pass because they are working
up scoring plays for later games, and
Staters will pass because it will
probably be their only prayer for
yards.
Coach Jim Bradshaw ran first,
second, and third teams through
an extended session of pass plays
last night. A combined forward
lateral looked promising, with the
fullback shooting a short one to
the half, and from the first half
to the second half off on the (lank.
Either Jimmy Coffis or Tom Col
lins finally gets the ball, and with
the interference shown yesterday
it should be worth six points.
Fullbacks Paulman and Hamilton
alternated at firing passes, both get
ting along fine, with the added threat
of a fake pass and line smash. Brad
shaw also tried an exchangeable five
or seven man line, aimed to con
fuse the opponent and lend a more
versatile attack.
Staters Tricky
Coach Bradshaw is little concerned
over the outcome of the game, but
is wary of certain tricky stuff the
State coach is fond of pulling—a
play, for instance, where the four
backs and a couple of linemen all
run back to a huddle when the ball
is passed, and then scatter, each
feigning possession of the ball.
The probable frosh starting line
up: ,Dakan and Layer, ends; Oberg
and Krupp, tackles; Holridgc and
Partridge, guards; Heath, center;
Roberts, quarter, Paulman, full; and
Coffis and Collins, halves.
Halfback Ed Gillette is out with
his knee out of place; Grant Stone, i
end injured last week, is ready for
action.
