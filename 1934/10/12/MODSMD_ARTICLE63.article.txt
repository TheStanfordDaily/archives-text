# VARSITY SOCCER PLAYERS TO BATTLE POLY ELEVEN
## 
### John McClelland 
Soccermen have another tough
test battle On their hands tomorrow
morning when they oppose the clas
siest outfit of the city prep soccer
leagues—Polytechnic high school.
Last Saturday it took the combined
efforts of three full Card teams to
beat a weak San Jose State team
by a score of 2-0. The Polytechnic
boys easily beat the San Jose team
earlier in the season 6-2.
These two first games are practice
tilts aimed at conditioning the play
ers for the conference schedule which
will start next week, but they are
also a good testing basis by which
Couch Harry Maloney can sec what
his men can do.
Forty-Five Practicing
There are 45 men, mostly sopho
mores and new players, who are
making bids for first string berths
and reputations that are made to
morrow are likely to be lasting ones.
Dining practices Maloney has been
scrimmaging the varsity and frosh—
all 70 of them—together. Next week,
however, he is going to get his A and
B squads definitely lined up so that
by Wednesday when the Cards meet
San Mateo in the first conference
game the best of the varsity will
have been seeded out. .
Offense Best Defense
"I never pay much attention to
the backs," Maloney readily admits.

"The forwards are the ones who do
the business of the squad and if they
are working a team doesn't need any
defense. The best defense in soccer
is to keep constantly on the offense."
The starting line-up which was
picked for last week's game will
probably be considerably changed
for tomorrow's lilt.
Along the forward wall a gap will
be left at center forward with Al
Navarro on the injured list. Hank
Eversole, a sophomore, or perhaps
Mike Gomez will be used in his
stead. Other probable forward start
ers will be Dibble at outside right,
Row at inside right, and Rigby at
outside left.
Halfbacks Named
In the halfback line Captain Wad
dy White will be in his usual place
on the left flank. Walker is due to
play in the key center half position
but the right berth is in question.
Bob Hall, another sophomore, has
been showing up well in practice
and may hold down this place in the
starting line-up.
At fullback there is likely to be
another change. Steve Enke, first
year man who learned his soccer in
the old country, is making a firm bid
for the left back position. At right
back will be either Vicrling or Peck.
McClelland and a newcorper, Wil
son, are the goalies in shape for to
morrow's game.

will start next week, but they are
also a good testing basis by which
Couch Harry Maloney can sec what
his men can do.
Forty-Five Practicing
There are 45 men, mostly sopho
mores and new players, who are
making bids for first string berths
and reputations that are made to
morrow are likely to be lasting ones.
Dining practices Maloney has been
scrimmaging the varsity and frosh—
all 70 of them—together. Next week,
however, he is going to get his A and
B squads definitely lined up so that
by Wednesday when the Cards meet
San Mateo in the first conference
game the best of the varsity will
have been seeded out. .
Offense Best Defense
"I never pay much attention to
the backs," Maloney readily admits.

"The forwards are the ones who do
the business of the squad and if they
are working a team doesn't need any
defense. The best defense in soccer
is to keep constantly on the offense."
The starting line-up which was
picked for last week's game will
probably be considerably changed
for tomorrow's lilt.
Along the forward wall a gap will
be left at center forward with Al
Navarro on the injured list. Hank
Eversole, a sophomore, or perhaps
Mike Gomez will be used in his
stead. Other probable forward start
ers will be Dibble at outside right,
Row at inside right, and Rigby at
outside left.
Halfbacks Named
In the halfback line Captain Wad
dy White will be in his usual place
on the left flank. Walker is due to
play in the key center half position
but the right berth is in question.
Bob Hall, another sophomore, has
been showing up well in practice
and may hold down this place in the
starting line-up.
At fullback there is likely to be
another change. Steve Enke, first
year man who learned his soccer in
the old country, is making a firm bid
for the left back position. At right
back will be either Vicrling or Peck.
McClelland and a newcorper, Wil
son, are the goalies in shape for to
morrow's game.
Soccermen have another tough
test battle On their hands tomorrow
morning when they oppose the clas
siest outfit of the city prep soccer
leagues—Polytechnic high school.
Last Saturday it took the combined
efforts of three full Card teams to
beat a weak San Jose State team
by a score of 2-0. The Polytechnic
boys easily beat the San Jose team
earlier in the season 6-2.
These two first games are practice
tilts aimed at conditioning the play
ers for the conference schedule which
will start next week, but they are
also a good testing basis by which
Couch Harry Maloney can sec what
his men can do.
