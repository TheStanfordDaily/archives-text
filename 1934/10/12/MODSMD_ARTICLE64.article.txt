# FROSH WATER POLO TEAM LOOKS GOOD
## 
### 
"Practice makes perfect" may ap
ply correctly to Coach Nort Thorn
ton's frosh water polo team this year.
The yearlings are still far from per
fect, but recent hard workouts have
rubbed off many of the rough spots.
With the first siring beginning to
shape up fairly definitely, the '38
paddlers are conceded a good chance
of conquering Palo Alto High School
a week from today in the first game
of the current season.
The Paly High Vikings have an
other strong team, with only two
men missing from their champion
seven of last year, but the Papooses
should at least give them a close
game.
Jack Loupe and Bill Hanna, pre -
viously mentioned as stars, are both
regulars at present, playing forward
and center back, respectively. Stan
Wilson is at sprint, and Warren
Smith handles the other forward job.
Jack Osborne and Cameron Hall are

the leading guards outside of Harma.
A close three-cornered fight is on for
the regular goalie post between Mei
Jacoby, Sanford Lowengart, an:l
Henry Alchich.
Other frosh who have shown
promise include Tench, Mathicws,
DiGrassi, Hooker, Shaw, Hornby,
Wangenheim, McKellar, Mellon,
Eckland, and Stoddard.
