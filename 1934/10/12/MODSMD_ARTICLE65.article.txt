### 
DETROIT, Oct. 11 l/P). â€”Lynwood
Rowe, number one pitcher of the
Detroit Tigers, obtained a license to
marry today, but the ceremony won't
take place until he and his childhood
sweetheart from Eldorado, Ark., Miss
Edna Mary Skinner, can get "away
from the crowds and be alone with
just a few friends and I'elatives."
