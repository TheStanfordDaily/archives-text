# COAST FOOTBALL CLUBS SCHEDULE VARIED CONTESTS
## Oregon, Washington Head Conference Tilts; Few Breathers Listed 
### 
Intersectional clashes, breather
games, and feature contests are the
order for most Pacific Coast football
teams this week following a big pro- ,
gram of conference clashes 'last Sat
urday and preceding another full
program for next week.
The East meets the West in major
combat twice twnorrow as Stanford
entertains Northwestern and U.S.C.
travels to Pittsburgh to tangle with
the Panthers of the Pennsylvania
city.
Pitt Favored
Pitt is sirong and is slightly fa
vored to beat a Trojan sijuad thai
has so far been having trouble or
ganizing. However, Coach Howard |
Jones has loads of material and lie
admits the development is purely a
coaching problem, which means j
U.S.C. may blossom forth into i;
old self most any week-end.
Only two conference games are
scheduled, one being between a
pair of undefeated Northwestern
schools, Oregon and Washington.
Washington will be attempting to
break a seven-year jinx that, has
been held over her head by the '
Webfeet. The Seattle Huskies have
not been permitted to so much as 1
score in this big game of the Pacific
Northwest during that seven-year
famine. Oregon is once again fa- .
vored over the Phelan men.
Bruins Try Comeback
The other conference clash is of 1
lesser importance, finding Montana
meeting U.C.L.A. in Olympic Sta
dium at Los Angeles. The Bruins
will be attempting a comeback to
gridiron prominence following their
26-3 beating from Oregon two weeks
ago.
