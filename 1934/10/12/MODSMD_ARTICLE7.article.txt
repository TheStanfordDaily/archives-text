# SECOND STUDY HALL PLANNED IN AD BUILDING
## Overflow from Library Is To Be Placed In Old Lobby 
### 
The lobby of the Administration
building, reading room of the Stan
ford library in early days, will again
become a study hall within a few
weeks, according to the announce
ment of Nathan Van Patten, director
of University libraries.
The largest registration in Stan
ford history has swamped the pres
ent facilities of the library, making
demands on the seating room and
books that cannot be met by the size
of the, building. The library, when
it was built, was not intended for
the large number of students regis
tered and the increase in the size of
the Lower Division.
As a partial solution of this prob
lem, the administration decided to
make use of the old reading room.
Tables Provided
The facilities to be provided in this
study hall include tables and chairs
to accommodate not less than 128
students. Although students will be
welcome to make use of this room
during the day as a study hall, Van
Patten points out that such use ob
viously will be interfered with some
what by the traffic which is more or
less active there at that time.
In the evening, probably between
7 and 10 o'clock —the exact hours
have not yet been determined—pro
vision will be made for giving a
partial service to students in exten
sion of the service now offered in the
reserve book room.
Books Issued
Students failing to find accom
modation in the latter room may
take books to the Ad building, or
may use the reserve books issued
there for certain of the courses in
the Lower Division having a large
enrollment.
A new supply of books t is being
purchased for the new reading room.
The desks and chairs will have to be
constructed. Lighting facilities, de
signed for efficiency and utility, will
have to be installed. All of these
activities will take time, and it may
be a few weeks before the new study
hall will be ready for operation, but
the library authorities are making
efforts to have it ready as soon as
possible.
Supplements Library
Van Patten says: "It should be
borne in mind that this new facility
is supplementary and will not com
pletely duplicate the facilities at
present offered in the Reserve Book
Room.
"Other expansion of library facil
ities is under consideration. The
library administration is deter
mined to give the best possible serv
ice to the student community and
in this effort is receiving the fullest
support from the University."

Tables Provided
The facilities to be provided in this
study hall include tables and chairs
to accommodate not less than 128
students. Although students will be
welcome to make use of this room
during the day as a study hall, Van
Patten points out that such use ob
viously will be interfered with some
what by the traffic which is more or
less active there at that time.
In the evening, probably between
7 and 10 o'clock —the exact hours
have not yet been determined—pro
vision will be made for giving a
partial service to students in exten
sion of the service now offered in the
reserve book room.
Books Issued
Students failing to find accom
modation in the latter room may
take books to the Ad building, or
may use the reserve books issued
there for certain of the courses in
the Lower Division having a large
enrollment.
A new supply of books t is being
purchased for the new reading room.
The desks and chairs will have to be
constructed. Lighting facilities, de
signed for efficiency and utility, will
have to be installed. All of these
activities will take time, and it may
be a few weeks before the new study
hall will be ready for operation, but
the library authorities are making
efforts to have it ready as soon as
possible.
Supplements Library
Van Patten says: "It should be
borne in mind that this new facility
is supplementary and will not com
pletely duplicate the facilities at
present offered in the Reserve Book
Room.
"Other expansion of library facil
ities is under consideration. The
library administration is deter
mined to give the best possible serv
ice to the student community and
in this effort is receiving the fullest
support from the University."
The lobby of the Administration
building, reading room of the Stan
ford library in early days, will again
become a study hall within a few
weeks, according to the announce
ment of Nathan Van Patten, director
of University libraries.
The largest registration in Stan
ford history has swamped the pres
ent facilities of the library, making
demands on the seating room and
books that cannot be met by the size
of the, building. The library, when
it was built, was not intended for
the large number of students regis
tered and the increase in the size of
the Lower Division.
As a partial solution of this prob
lem, the administration decided to
make use of the old reading room.
