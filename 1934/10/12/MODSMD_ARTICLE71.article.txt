# CRAIG GIVES TALK ON LITERARY MIND
## 
### 
Professor Hardin Craig of the
English department was the speaker
at the annual meeting of the Re
search Club held in the faculty club
house Wednesday night.
Professor Craig, an authority in
the field of psychology and ethics,
spoke on "What Constitutes a Lit
erary Background?"
The main subject stressed by the
speaker was that through the litera
ture of an age a perspective into the
minds of the people may be ob
tained. Choosing the Elizabethan
age as his subject, he stated that
"Renaissance literature is a reflec
tion of the Renaissance mind."
In regard to the thought processes
of the age, Professor Craig asserted
that the Scriptures were used con
tinually as a short-cut to thinking.
"To question the Scriptures was to
question God." This left no room for
constructive thought. Analogy and;
mythology were used to express
ideas, but they failed to put thought
into the realm of rationality.
Professor Craig's lecture was pre- j
ceded by an election of officers, in
which Arthur Kennedy, professor of
English philology, was elected presi- i
dent.
