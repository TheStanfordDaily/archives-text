# LAMSON GIVEN NEW TRIAL BY JUDGES' RULING
## Former Stanford Pressman Awaiting Transfer To San Jose Prison SISTER CONVEYS NEWS Most Justices Still Believe Defendant Is Guilty 
### John McClelland 
David Lamson, former sales man
ager of the University Press, sen
tenced to death for the murder of
his wife on the Stanford campus in
1933, was removed from the shadow
of the gallows, perhaps forever, as
the California Supreme Court Sat
urday granted his appeal for a new
trial.
Decision Expected
Although the decision oÂ£ the Court
has been expected by many to be
in favor of Lamson, the announce
ment came in a sensational manner
with Chief Justice William H. Waste
declaring that the new trial is being
granted in spite of the fact that the

majority of the justices feel Lamson
to be guilty.
Statements made by the various
members of the court indicate that
they feel the evidence presented
against Lamson is not of a nature
that definitely proves his guilt.
Reasons Given
Reasons given for the granting of
the new trial include beliefs that
the accident theory in the case ap
pears as reasonable as the murder
theory; that the testimony of the de
fendant was restricted by the trial
court; that the record does not es
ablish the guilt of the defendant "be
yond a reasonable doubt"; and that
there is a technical complication in
that a "courtesy" deputy sheriff
served on the jury which convicted
Lamson.
No actual new evidence has been
brought to light in regard to the
alleged killing of his wife by the
Stanford man. but a majority of the
justices feel that a more fair pre
sentation of the evidence by the de
fense should be allowed.
To Go to San Jose
Now in Condemned Row in San
Quentin prison, Lamson must wait
30 days before he can be removed to
San Jose where the new trial is to
be held.
The counsel for Lamson was jubi
lant at the decision of the court, be
lieving that a new trial will mean
certain acquittal. District Attorney
Fred L. Thomas, in charge of the
prosecution, had no statement to
make on the decision.
Dr. Margaret E. Lamson, sister of
David, who carried the news of the
court's decision to San Quentin, told
the Daily la.st night that "all the
family were very delighted. We
couldn't ask for a better decision
from any standpoint."
Winters Elated
Arthur Yvor Winters, instructor in
English, who this summer aided the
cause of the Lamson defense by
publishing a pamphlet and magazine
article in comment and review of the
evidence presented at the trials, also
declared himself delighted with the
result, of the court's decision. He
thinks some of the decision-state
ments made by the Justices are
among the finest things he has ever
seen.
On the morning of May 30, 1933,
Allene Thorpe Lamson, graduate of
'26 and former women's editor of the
Daily, was found dead by her hus
band in the bathtub of the Lamson j
home at 622 Salvatierra street. A
deep gash in the back of the head, i
claimed by doctors to have been j
caused by a large, blunt instrument,
was the only wound apparent on the,
body.
Accused of Murder
Justice officials at once took Lam
son into custody and later charged j
him with killing his wife. No definite !
motive for the crime has ever been J
found and the defendant based his j
defense on an attempt to prove that j
Mrs. Lamson met her death in an
accidental fall.
After a trial of less than three
weeks, the death penalty was!
brought against Lamson on Septem- j
ber 16, 1933. A new trial immediately
was asked by the defense.
Sentenced To Die
On September 26, 1933, Lamson
was sentenced to die on the gallows ,
at San Quentin and Lamson was .
taken to prison.
Early last. December the Suprerfte
Court began a study of the transcript!
of the trial, the exhibits presented at j
the trial, and all the evidence con

cerned.
In February the defense filed a 608-
page brief with the Supreme Court
and in June the defense filed a brief
of 230 pages.
Chronicle Fined
On September 10 the San Fran
cisco Chronicle published an article
stating that the high tribunal had
granted Lamson a new trial. The
newspaper was fined $1000 for con
tempt and for publishing a false
article.
The actual decision was announced
Saturday. The date for the new
trial has not yet been set.
