# LAMSON GIVEN NEW TRIAL BY JUDGES' RULING
## Former Stanford Pressman Awaiting Transfer To San Jose Prison SISTER CONVEYS NEWS Most Justices Still Believe Defendant Is Guilty 
### John McClelland 
David Lamson, former sales man
ager of the University Press, sen
tenced to death for the murder of
his wife on the Stanford campus in
1933, was removed from the shadow
of the gallows, perhaps forever, as
the California Supreme Court Sat
urday granted his appeal for a new
trial.
Decision Expected
Although the decision o£ the Court
has been expected by many to be
in favor of Lamson, the announce
ment came in a sensational manner
with Chief Justice William H. Waste
declaring that the new trial is being
granted in spite of the fact that the

majority of the justices feel Lamson
to be guilty.
Statements made by the various
members of the court indicate that
they feel the evidence presented
against Lamson is not of a nature
that definitely proves his guilt.
Reasons Given
Reasons given for the granting of
the new trial include beliefs that
the accident theory in the case ap
pears as reasonable as the murder
theory; that the testimony of the de
fendant was restricted by the trial
court; that the record does not es
ablish the guilt of the defendant "be
yond a reasonable doubt"; and that
there is a technical complication in
that a "courtesy" deputy sheriff
served on the jury which convicted
Lamson.
No actual new evidence has been
brought to light in regard to the
alleged killing of his wife by the
Stanford man. but a majority of the
justices feel that a more fair pre
sentation of the evidence by the de
fense should be allowed.
To Go to San Jose
Now in Condemned Row in San
Quentin prison, Lamson must wait
30 days before he can be removed to
San Jose where the new trial is to
be held.
The counsel for Lamson was jubi
lant at the decision of the court, be
lieving that a new trial will mean
certain acquittal. District Attorney
Fred L. Thomas, in charge of the
prosecution, had no statement to
make on the decision.
Dr. Margaret E. Lamson, sister of
David, who carried the news of the
court's decision to San Quentin, told
the Daily la.st night that "all the
family were very delighted. We
couldn't ask for a better decision
from any standpoint."
Winters Elated
Arthur Yvor Winters, instructor in
English, who this summer aided the
cause of the Lamson defense by
publishing a pamphlet and magazine
article in comment and review of the
evidence presented at the trials, also
declared himself delighted with the
result, of the court's decision. He
thinks some of the decision-state
