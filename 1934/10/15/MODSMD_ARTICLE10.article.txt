# LECTURER WILL TALK ON MUSIC
## Rev. Dom Hughes Presented As Tuesday Speaker 
### 
"English Choral Music of the Fif
teenth Century" is the subject of the
next lecture of the Tuesday Evening
Series to be given tomorrow night
at 7:30 in the Assembly Hall by Rev
erend Dom Anselm Hughes, Order of
St. Benedict, distinguished historian
of medieval music.
Dealing also with the music of
Henry VI and the Agincourt Song,
Dom Hughes' lecture will be illus
trated with victrola recordings. In a
recent discussion of the revival of
500-year-old music which has re
cently been brought to light, Dom
Hughes commented: "My chief in
terest this year is centered around
the compositions of King Henry VI
and the other musicians of his Royal
Chapel. Many of their songs are of
first-rate value."
Composers of the fifteenth cen
tury, including Henry VI, knew quite
as much about syncopated music as
we do. The all-important question is
whether this music has a message
for us or whether it is just evidence
for the historian, says Dom Hughes,
secretary-treasurer of the Plain
Song and Medieval Music Society.
Dom Hughes has been lecturing
in Australia and New Zealand and
is now returning to Nashdom Abbey,
Burnham, England, his home.
