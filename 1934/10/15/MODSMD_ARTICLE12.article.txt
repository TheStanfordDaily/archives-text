# DEBATERS OPEN SEASON OCT. 26
## To Discuss State Campaign With California Team 
### 
Varsity debaters will swing into
interscholastic action for the first
time this quarter on October 26,
when Stanford will meet California
at Berkeley on the question of the
political campaign for governor. The
three men who are to represent
Stanford have not yet been selected,
but will probably be picked some
time next week by Coach Lee
Chapin.
On October 29 a return debate on
the same question will be held at
Stanford, when three men from the
Farm will uphold the opposite side of
the issue.
The San Quentin debate—always
one of the most interesting of the
season—will occur on November 4,
inside the prison walls. The ques
tion will probably deal with com
pulsory health insurance. Unfortu
nately there will be no return en
gagement locally with the convicts.
The national Pi Kappa Delta ques
tion, "Resolved: That the nations
should agree to prevent the interna
tional shipment of arms and muni
tions," will be debated at and with
the College of the Pacific on Novem
ber 14. A three-man team will rep
resent Stanford.
