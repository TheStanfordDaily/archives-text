# Students On Pack Trip Eat Much, Lose Weight
## 
### 
For 17 people to consume 290
pounds of food apiece in 35 days,
and for those same people to lose
an average of 3 pounds each during
those 35 days is at least amazing;
yet A1 Page, Alpha Delt and a main
stay of Stanford's basketball team
has the explanation.
Back on the campus, his athletic
appearance unaltered, Page shows
no ill effect from the 5 week pack
trip he took this summer in the
Sierra mountains with a party of 17
beaded by W. Parmer Fuller, Stan
ford trustee.
In the company of George Fuller,
Jr., Stanford '34, now attending Har
vard; Marion Hewlitt, Stanford '33;
her sister, Jane, Stanford '35; Mary
Lee Harlan '36; Betty Lee Wright '38;
John Fuller; and Joseph Sexton
Thompson, brother of Kathleen
Norris, Page started from Kennedy
Meadows in the northern Sierra near
the Sonora pass road and horse
backed 327 miles south to Giant
Forest in Sequoia national park.
Four packers, two cooks, 22 pack

mules, and 17 horses supported the
party.
"We carried, all told, 5000 pounds
food, and ate 4800 pounds of it,"
Page explained. "Yet on the average
i each of us lost three pounds."
"We were only twice below 8.000
feet, once at Simpson meadow on
the middle fork of the Kings river
and again at Kanawyerst on the
South fork on that river," Page
j added.
Page claimed no honors except
(hose for the most eating and sleep
ing, and heaped on his brother Alpha
, Delt, George Fuller, the fishing
' honors. •
"Once, on our real mountain climb
during the trip," Page told, "we had
I reached the top of Milestone
1 Mountain, near Mount Whitney and
i were starting the descent, when a
I hail storm pelted us with stones of
ice the size of marbles. By the time
iwe returned to camp the whole
I range seemed blanketed with snow.
! It was a two-inch layer of hail in
I late August."
