# BOARD FINALLY GIVES DECISION ON S. F. STRIKE
## Labor Heads Greet Verdict Of Committee With Varying Views 
### Dave Mellinkoff 
(See Bull Session on page 2 for
further discussion of strike decision.)
The arbitral decision for the most
widespread and bloody strike which
the Pacific Coast has ever seen has
at last been handed down by the
President's Longshoremen's Board.
It is hailed by the San Francisco
press as a great victory for organ
ized labor. It is met with a tremen
dous outburst of approval by the
convention of the American Federa
tion of Labor. Thomas G. Plant,
president of the Waterfront Employ
ers Association, has little to say for
the agreement except that it will be
observed. Harry Bridges, president
of the San Francisco local of the In
ternational Longshoremen's Associa
tion and militant strike leader, sul
lenly i-efuses to comment.
Set Higher Wages
Running through two and one-half
newspaper columns, it is no wonder
that somebody—almost everybody—
should find something to complain of
in one of the eleven sections.
Why is a large section of labor
jubilant? Undoubtedly because the
arbitrating Archbishop, Attorney,
and Assistant Secretary of Labor
have decided that the 30-hour week
shall be a reality in longshore work;
that 95 cents shall be the hourly pay
for straight time, $1.40 hourly pay for
overtime; that the "dispatcher" in
hiring halls shall be a longshore
man; that wage increases shall be
retroactive to July 31, 1934—the day
the arbitration officially began.
Reds Not To Profit
Why Ls Hairy Bridges sullen? Be
cause hiring halls for longshoremen,
winch drivers, hatch tenders, side
runners, burton men, and the rest of
the brawny crew are to be jointly
controlled by employers and em
ployees—and not by labor alone, as
the strikers had demanded. Adding
to his state of depression is the fact
that only men who have been en
gaged in longshoring for 12 months
out of the last three years are to be
among the eligible under the strike
decision; this will exclude from the
I.L.A. many of Bridges' militants and
Communist buddies who started dock
work within the few months pre
ceding the strike. Further reason of
the Bridges dejection is the whole of
Section 11.
This section, the last in the docu
ment, preserves to employers their
right to hire and fire whomsoever
they please from among those quali
fying for longshore work. Bridges
no doubt, wonders why this provi
sion must be tacked on to the deci
sion, when elsewhere is stated spe
cifically that men shall be hired by
jointly controlled hiring halls. He
wonders, too, about Section 6: "All
longshoremen shall be dispatched
without favoritism or discrimina
tion, regardless of union or non
union membership."
Insures Peace
Without direct insight into the
cerebral gyrations of the employers,
one may make a fair guess that em
ployers arc satisfied with the agrec
ment for about the same reasons
that Bridges is apathetic about it.
Furthermore, the decision binds both
sides to peace until September 30,
1935—which may give time to re
coup some of the heavy losses suf
fered during the weeks of strike
paralysis.

wonders, too, about Section 6: "All
longshoremen shall be dispatched
without favoritism or discrimina
tion, regardless of union or non
union membership."
Insures Peace
Without direct insight into the
cerebral gyrations of the employers,
one may make a fair guess that em
ployers arc satisfied with the agrec
ment for about the same reasons
that Bridges is apathetic about it.
Furthermore, the decision binds both
sides to peace until September 30,
1935—which may give time to re
coup some of the heavy losses suf
fered during the weeks of strike
paralysis.
(See Bull Session on page 2 for
further discussion of strike decision.)
The arbitral decision for the most
widespread and bloody strike which
the Pacific Coast has ever seen has
at last been handed down by the
President's Longshoremen's Board.
It is hailed by the San Francisco
press as a great victory for organ
ized labor. It is met with a tremen
dous outburst of approval by the
convention of the American Federa
tion of Labor. Thomas G. Plant,
president of the Waterfront Employ
ers Association, has little to say for
the agreement except that it will be
observed. Harry Bridges, president
of the San Francisco local of the In
ternational Longshoremen's Associa
tion and militant strike leader, sul
lenly i-efuses to comment.
Set Higher Wages
Running through two and one-half
newspaper columns, it is no wonder
that somebody—almost everybody—
should find something to complain of
in one of the eleven sections.
Why is a large section of labor
jubilant? Undoubtedly because the
arbitrating Archbishop, Attorney,
and Assistant Secretary of Labor
have decided that the 30-hour week
shall be a reality in longshore work;
that 95 cents shall be the hourly pay
for straight time, $1.40 hourly pay for
overtime; that the "dispatcher" in
hiring halls shall be a longshore
man; that wage increases shall be
retroactive to July 31, 1934—the day
the arbitration officially began.
Reds Not To Profit
Why Ls Hairy Bridges sullen? Be
cause hiring halls for longshoremen,
winch drivers, hatch tenders, side
runners, burton men, and the rest of
the brawny crew are to be jointly
controlled by employers and em
ployees—and not by labor alone, as
the strikers had demanded. Adding
to his state of depression is the fact
that only men who have been en
gaged in longshoring for 12 months
out of the last three years are to be
among the eligible under the strike
decision; this will exclude from the
I.L.A. many of Bridges' militants and
Communist buddies who started dock
work within the few months pre
ceding the strike. Further reason of
the Bridges dejection is the whole of
Section 11.
This section, the last in the docu
ment, preserves to employers their
right to hire and fire whomsoever
they please from among those quali
fying for longshore work. Bridges
no doubt, wonders why this provi
sion must be tacked on to the deci
sion, when elsewhere is stated spe
cifically that men shall be hired by
jointly controlled hiring halls. He
wonders, too, about Section 6: "All
longshoremen shall be dispatched
without favoritism or discrimina
tion, regardless of union or non
union membership."
