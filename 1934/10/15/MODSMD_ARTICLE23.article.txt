# Cards Prepare For S. F. U. Tilt After 20-0 Wildcat Win
## Bones Hamilton Takes Over Grayson Role, Scores Two Touchdowns 
### Mort D'Evelyn 
With a satisfactory showing in
their 20-0 win Saturday over North
western behind them, the Card var
sity will start practice today for
next Saturday's game with San
Francisco University.
Supposedly a "breather," the
S.F.U. game will find the Cards
matched against one of those tough
teams from small schools that have
been playing havoc with the fa
vorites this season. Witness Gon
zaga 13, Washington State 6, and
Nevada 9, St. Mary's 7 over the past
week-end.
Grayson on Bench
While Grayson remained on the
bench to rest a bruised hip, Bones
Hamilton led the Stanford running
attack to a decisive win over a team
which was given even odds by some
of the sports writers before the
game.
Stanford early showed the supe
riority of its running attack over
the Northwestern defense and
threatened in the first quarter and
again early in the second, when
Monk Moscrip's attempted field goal
fell short. The first Card score did
not come until the middle of the
second quarter, however, after
Claude Callaway, Stanford tackle,
had partially blocked George Pot
ter's punt.
Indians Penalized
Stanford took the ball on North
western's 29. Hamilton made two at
right tackle, but the Indians were
penalized five yards for a fourth
time out. Alustiza picked up one on
a spinner. A pass, Hamilton to Keith
Topping, put the ball on the 17-yard
line. Hamilton stepped back for an
other pass, then cut back over right
guard, side-stepped several of the
Wildcat defense and crossed the goal
standing up. Moscrip's attempted
conversion was blocked.
The second score followed quickly
when Potter kicked out on the
Northwestern 39 after the Wildcats
had received the kick-off. Hamilton
found left tackle good for five yards
on the first down. Van Dellen on a
reverse broke into the clear for a
long gain and was finally downed by
the safety man on the 19. Hamilton
lost one and Gordon Head two more
as the famed Northwestern forward
wall stiffened.
Van Dcllcn Takes Ball
Van Dellen then drove over right
tackle for a first down on the seven
yard line. Van Dellen was thrown
for a four-yard loss. Hamilton cut
back over guard for two, then faked
a reverse and picked up six more.
From the three-yard line Hamilton
found a good-sized hole at left
tacklc and scored the second touch
down. This time Moscrip's conver
sion was good.
Stanford lost little momentum
during the half time lay-off, and
made their final score shortly after
play was resumed. Northwestern
had just started one of their short
lived drives. Potter passed to Harry
Leeper for a first down and Len
Hayskar added five around right end.
Bob Swisher was repulsed at center.
Potter dropped back for a pass and
heaved a long one, intended for
Leeper.
Intercepts Pass
Frank Alustiza intercepted the
ball on the run and raced for the
side-lines. A four-man interference
formed out of nowhere, but Alus
tiza speeded ahead of his escort.
A last Northwestern tackier lunged
at him on the three-yard line, but
the Basque, squirmed into the corner
of the end zone, chalking up six
points for the 37-yard run. Moscrip
converted, and Stanford was through
scoring for the afternoon.
