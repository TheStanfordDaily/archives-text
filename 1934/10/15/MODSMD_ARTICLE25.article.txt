Learned and venerable members of Gal
it ornia's Supreme Court handed down a de
cision of interest to the entire nation. David
A. La in so n wil I â€¢ receive a new trial. One
member of the group might have been said to
render that same decision.
Aside I rom the merits of the case, since the
authorities have decided that the original trial
was illegally conducted, we beg to voice the
following question:
"Why should any individual member of a
supreme court, that has ordered a new trial
in the case ol a declared mistrial, take it upon
himself to state for 'a majority of the court'
that the individual concerned was believed
guilty even though granted a new trial?
The point raised by the DAILY is not as to
whether the justice who took it upon himself
to speak for the group actually did so in good
faith.. Later reports have shown that a major
ity of the court will not affirm the statement.
Hut the very elementary, basic, and serious
matter that lies behind the present instance is
far more important for the future of America's
legal system.
A member of any supreme court holds "a
most esteemed position in the community. He
is looked up to hv ordinary man, and when he
voices an opinion, that opinion is considered
very seriously by those who hear.
A chief justice has now declared that a man
is thought to be guilty by the same body that
lias granted him a new trial.
Should that man's case come to trial, al-
I hough reports have it that prosecutors are
even now debating the probabilities, a good
percentage of the jurors selected shal.l have
already read in the papers that " a majority
of the Justices" feel that the man is guilty.
What can be done about it is very difficult
to determine. Yet, no man, especially one who
represents that which should be thought of as
fair and just, should make a public declaration
that might even remotely affect a later verdict.
