# Moleskins, Frosh!

Pants though not intrinsically important,
do, as one might say, cover ;i multitude of
shins. Thev also serve as milestones in man's
march toward the inillenium. For centuries
men wore no pants. Then tor centuries they
wore short pants. And now for more than a
century they have been wearing long pants.
This either proves that, with the coining of
long pants, man h:is reached the highest stage
in civilization or else it proves that in the days
of the Greeks and the Romans, when men
wore no pants, civilization had reached its
highest peak. II is difficult to deter mine which.
Likewise, then the observation that Stan
lord men seem to have discarded cords and
moleskins to a great extent, in favor <»1 flannels
and tweeds, is probably fraught with no great
sociological signifiaence. Nevertheless, trace it
to the feminine influence or what you will, the
facts seem to be incontrovertible.
Time was when no self-respecting freshman
failed to don a pair of moleskins immediately
upon arrival and to wear them continuously
throughout the school year, usually without
benefit of soap and water. Now the vanishing
moleskins seems to be joining the vanishing
redskin in the march toward extinction.
Soon we will emulate fair Harvard where,
we are reliably informed, any student who
deigns to enter the library without coat and
tic, is politely asked to remove bis plebian
presence.
The corduroy trouser, Ihe somewhat soiled
hallmark of student democracy, seems
doomed. With it will pass the pristine vigor

of the Stanford rough. And as the rough goes,
so goes Stanford. Sir transit gloria niundi!
