With the announcement that U.C.L.A and
C.C.B. (t'niversity of (California at Berkeley,
aeeording to the t'niversity of at Cos Angeles)
are establishing a Blind Date Bureau for their
mutual dating quandaries, the height of inter
eampi cooperation has been reached.
Prompted by the forthcoming 17.C.L.A.-l 7 .C.L.A.-
1'.C.8. grid clash, the bureau will furnish male
or female dates and transportation for all
Bruin rooters who travel to the game at Berke
ley. The following year when the scene of
battle shifts to Los Angeles, the bureau otlice
there will reciprocate.
All the applicants must do is till in a ques
tionnaire with sex, height, color, preferred
entertainment and get his or her suit or dress
pressed, and the bureau does the rest.
Barnuin was right.
