II is is not stretching the meaning of the
word too far, il may be said that the Stanford
farm has been aroused politically.
The mess <H' propaganda so far before No
vember's election has been stupendous. Stu
pendous in two ways. Nnprecedented r<>l is be
ing hurled from one political camp to another
There is actual fear in each'camp, that il the
other emerges victorious the fair state ol Cal
ifornia is speedily doomed to extinction.
In an exceedingly interesting series of state
ments, we, who live on the Stanford campus,
are given to understand what Mr. Sinclair
thinks of our university. In the voluble lan
guage of the novelist, Sinclair makes some ob
servations, objective, of course, and written
from the unbiased viewpoint of I'pton Sin
clair.
There are various types of people who know
nothing about the makeup of a university.
They are, for the greater part, those who gain
their impressions from the Hollywood cine
mas, but there are also those so-called "intel
lectuals" who deem themselves so much above
the ordinary mortal, that it is necessary lor
them to follow the truth, or make inquiries,
before they state their conclusions.
In other words, Mr. Sinclair, because he
wanted so much to reveal the "great truth
about Stanford, must have written his descrip
tion with the aid of a Bing Crosby cinema, a
copy of College Humor, and a preconceived
notion of what the average university stands
for.
11 is a shame that Sinclair did not speak
upon this subject, obviously so close to his
lingertips, when he lectured before Stanford
students in the Assembly Hall, earlier this
year. Instead, the worthy strategist lectured
about himself and his political theories, and at
the conclusion of the speech, went so lar as to
sell in the capitalistic coin of the realm, copies
of his political doctrines to the students.
Each week, the Associated Students re
ceived an underlined coyp (from I .S.C. cam
pus) of some of Sinclair s statements, whiih
mentioned Stanford as maintaining a \ellow
dog fund" for "professional athletes."
So with S.C. for Sinclair and throwing
stones from the big Class House, what need is
there for the remainder of the world to worry?
What happened in 1914 demonstrated that
"complete anarchy is even more. dangerous as

In other words, Mr. Sinclair, because he
wanted so much to reveal the "great truth
about Stanford, must have written his descrip
tion with the aid of a Bing Crosby cinema, a
copy of College Humor, and a preconceived
notion of what the average university stands
for.
11 is a shame that Sinclair did not speak
upon this subject, obviously so close to his
lingertips, when he lectured before Stanford
students in the Assembly Hall, earlier this
year. Instead, the worthy strategist lectured
about himself and his political theories, and at
the conclusion of the speech, went so lar as to
sell in the capitalistic coin of the realm, copies
of his political doctrines to the students.
Each week, the Associated Students re
ceived an underlined coyp (from I .S.C. cam
pus) of some of Sinclair s statements, whiih
mentioned Stanford as maintaining a \ellow

So with S.C. for Sinclair and throwing
stones from the big Class House, what need is
there for the remainder of the world to worry?

other emerges victorious the fair state ol Cal
ifornia is speedily doomed to extinction.
In an exceedingly interesting series of state
ments, we, who live on the Stanford campus,
are given to understand what Mr. Sinclair
thinks of our university. In the voluble lan
guage of the novelist, Sinclair makes some ob
servations, objective, of course, and written
from the unbiased viewpoint of I'pton Sin
clair.
There are various types of people who know
nothing about the makeup of a university.
They are, for the greater part, those who gain
their impressions from the Hollywood cine
