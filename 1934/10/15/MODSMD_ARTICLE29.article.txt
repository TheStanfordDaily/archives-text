# THE 						MAN BEHIND THE NAME ...
## POSTMASTER-GENERAL FARLEY, "BIG JIM" 
### BOB JONES 
Of all the days I chose to drop in on James A. ("Call
me Jim") Farley, postmaster-general, it was the one
afternoon that he was dedicating the elaborate nsw
postoffice department building there on Pennsylvania
avenue in Washington.
People massed in his office immediately following
the ceremony to meet him, to shake his hand. Small
town politicians, along with persons looking for political
plums, were there in hordes. Secretaries had their
hands full.
Visitors flocked into his new, spacious, paneled of
fice. A fine, framed picture of Franklin IX Roosevelt
hung in a most conspicuous place. There were signed
pictures of Mussolini and other world notables. On the
wall behind his new, unscratched desk was a huge
portrait of Benjamin Franklin, postmaster-general of
the Colonies.
Flowers and horseshoe wreaths with messages of
greeting and good luck were everywhere. A band
played outside in a long hallway and lobby. On the
walls of another of the many halls wore strung the
pictures of the postmaster-generals back to the early
nineteenth century.
Freely through his many rooms moved the crowd.
Some persons even stopped at his desk to read or look
at whatever was tying in full view. Farley entered
the room from the side. Visitors stopped eyeing ob
jects to look at him. It was certainly "Big Jim." He
was the biggest in stature of the men of note I was to
see—six feet two and one-half inchcs and weighing
politician—big, bald-headed, and round faced.
Besides his large size, "Call me Jim is outstanding
in his character and habils. It is reported that he
neither drinks nor smokes, but chews gum constantly.
The chairman of the Democratic National committee is
a man of iron physique, a natural-born politician and
salesman, having been the first postmaster-general in
some time not to show a deficit in yearly earnings.
He appeared to be a practical man without fancy
theories. His actions indicated that there seemed to
be always one main thought haunting him: that of
building a political machine that will re-elect Roosevelt
in 1936. It was Farley who bad more to do with
electing Roosevelt in 1932 than any other man in Inn
country.
I moved up to him and introduced myself. We
talked. Several times "friends" interrupted to extend
greetings to the Roosevelt patronage manager.
1 finally left. Farley seemed to be too much polities.

Of all the days I chose to drop in on James A. ("Call
me Jim") Farley, postmaster-general, it was the one
afternoon that he was dedicating the elaborate nsw
postoffice department building there on Pennsylvania
avenue in Washington.
People massed in his office immediately following
the ceremony to meet him, to shake his hand. Small
town politicians, along with persons looking for political
plums, were there in hordes. Secretaries had their
hands full.
Visitors flocked into his new, spacious, paneled of
fice. A fine, framed picture of Franklin IX Roosevelt
hung in a most conspicuous place. There were signed
pictures of Mussolini and other world notables. On the
wall behind his new, unscratched desk was a huge
portrait of Benjamin Franklin, postmaster-general of
the Colonies.
Flowers and horseshoe wreaths with messages of
greeting and good luck were everywhere. A band
played outside in a long hallway and lobby. On the
walls of another of the many halls wore strung the
pictures of the postmaster-generals back to the early
nineteenth century.
Freely through his many rooms moved the crowd.
Some persons even stopped at his desk to read or look
at whatever was tying in full view. Farley entered
the room from the side. Visitors stopped eyeing ob
