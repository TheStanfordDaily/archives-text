Offering proof that the Stanford
rough can really rough it when
necessary are the experiences of
Nicol Smith '32, who has recently
returned to civilization after spend
ing four months in the depths of
South American jungles.
Penetrating the interior beyond
the last outpost of British and
Dutch Guiana, Smith experienced
thrilling adventures. Paddling up
the Kabalibo river in a native
piroque, Smith suddenly found him
self in the Kalalibo after his boat
overturned. He barely escaped with
his life. Later his food ran out and
wild monkeys had to be shot and
roasted. He saw a red baboon

phenomena resembling doormen on
Big Game night.
Smith is now en route home from
Panama, and will arrive at his home
in Hillsborough about November 1,
unless Hollywood producers sign him
up for the next Edgar Bice Bur
