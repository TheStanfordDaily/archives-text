(Editor's Note: This is the last of
a series of articles on the Stanford
Wholesale Commissary. In the first
two the history and present organ
i i/.ation of the "Co-op," through
which campus eating groups buy
their food, was described. This ar
j tide contains a discussion of the ad
vantages and disadvantages of the
organization that have been brought
out since its start in 1928.)
i Down in Branner basement, where
the Co-op stores its food, there is,
in the midst of all the crates and
! shelves, a small office. In this of
i fipe Manager Elliott Ayres not only
has to transact all the business that
i is necessary to feed over 900 people
daily, but also to meet student man
agers of any of the 30 member or
ganizations and listen to any com
-1 plaints or problems they may have.
The fact that problems arise and
complaints are made almost every
| week is yn indication of two things:
I first, that the Co-op is not without
criticism, and second, that the mem
! bers are constantly trying to find
. ways to improve it and make it more
| economical.
The latter statement is the main
' reason for the revision of the con
stitution last spring and the signing
| of new five-year contracts this fall.
Why Higher Prices?
Last week the new Board of Direc-
I tors, consisting of representatives
! from all the member organizations,
! met and considered several prob
j lems, among the most important be-
I ing that of finding an answer to the
question, "Why should it be possible
| to buy some foods for less in retail
! stores in Palo Alto than in the whole
! sale Co-op on the campus?"
An answer to that question is
! found in an analysis of business
methods of large chain stores and
1 markets, which shows that an acUial
! loss on some products is taken tem-
I porarily in order to advertise, while
high mark-up on other items neu
; tralizes this loss. As soon as busi
| ness is improved, a gradual rise of
' price on the cut-rate goods follows,
so that in the long run there is no
' advantage to the consumer from
i buying at such stores.
Efficiency Increasd
It is this long-range view that
j must be taken of the Co-op in order
Jto evaluate it properly. David E.
i Faville, professor of marketing in
! the School of Business and faculty
j member of the Board of Trustees of
j the Co-op, has attempted to do this
| in an analysis just completed.
"Although difficult to quote rep
! resentative figures, my investigation
i has proven that the Co-op compares
| favorably with local wholesalers,
i chain stores, and large markets," he
j states. "From my own observations,
i I should say that the efficiency of the
organization has increased markedly
during the last two years.
University Aids
"It seems to be still on the up
grade under the present arrange
ment," he continued, "and with sal
aries as low as they are and over
| head far below average, there is
j every reason to believe the Co-op
| should continue to be a valuable or
ganization, although there will al
ways be problems for the Directors to
solve."
The University is interested in the
I Co-op directly because of the finan
] cial aid it has given it; indirectly be-
I cause the food Ls stored, rent-free, in
j a University building, and because
j through the Co-op the fraternities
| are kept from being thrown into in
! debtedness by inefficient or inexpe
j rienced managers.
j Fundamentally, the Wholesale
j Commissary is a co-operative un
dertaking on the part of all its
members (o improve their financial
! status. If in the future there is 100
per cent co-operation instead of the
former 70 per cent, the feeling is
almost unanimous that the Co-op is
destined to become an indispensible
organization of lasting good on the
campus.
