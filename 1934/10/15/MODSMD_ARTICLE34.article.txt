"MILLION DOLLAR RANSOME"
At the Varsity Theater
A gangster chief deliberately puts
himself on the "spot" to safeguard
happiness of little innocent daugh- ,
ter, and the audience refuses to be-

come very sad —'
perhaps they i
have seen too
many such trite:
endings. Con
sidering th e j
brilliance of i
"Lady for a
Day," and "Lit-

I tie Miss Marker,' more originality 1
' might be expected from author
' Damon Runyon. The chances are
that Edward Arnold was chosen to |
j play the leading role of Public Ene
■ my No. 1, because of his remarkable '
I resemblence to A1 Capone, but nev- j
i theless, Mr. Arnold with a most con
j vincing characterization manages to
! steal the show.
