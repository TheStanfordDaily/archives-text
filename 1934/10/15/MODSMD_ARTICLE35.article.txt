LOST: ONE GOOD STRIKE
The San Francisco press screams
that labor has won the strike settle
ment. They scream so loudly that
one doubts tHe strength of their con
viction. The A. F. of L. applaudes i
the decision. They are afraid not
to; it is not sweet to acknowledge
defeat; and the A. F. of L. hates bitter
things. It has always operated under
the principle: Take what you can get '
and like it.
In this manner, the strike leader
Harry Bridges withholds his com
ment. He hates to face his men with
the truth. He hates to tell his men
that the "Great Maritime Strike" has
been lost cold. It cuts deep to tell |
them that for Pacific Coast labor,
the longshoremen's summer strike is
"the big fish that got away."
The one and only issue in the ;
strike— its raison d'etre —was union '
control of the hiring halls. That has j
not been gained. All that has been j
gained in increased wages could have j
been accomplished without the
bloodshed, without the biting cold of
fruitless nights spent on the water
front picket line, without the red- j
scare, and all the rest. Almost from 1
the first, employers were ready to j
discuss the matter of pay increase.
\
But that is all past. Union labor t
wanted control of the hiring halls,
because without such control labor- j
ers who dare to raise their voices in
protest against what they consider i
intolerable conditions are cracked- j
down on. They are refused jobs— \
not because they are physically or !
mentally incompetent—but because
they have, what on the football field j
is known as "guts." This discrimina- j
tion will unquestionably continue J
under the arbitrated settlement.
And as long as such business is 1
countenanced, there will be more
bitter strikes. There will be trouble ;
long before September 30, 1935.
Another important aspect of the '
strike that failed, is the problem of !
the boys left behind. According to
the agreement, those men who were
not employed as longshoremen for at
least one year out of the three pre- j
ceding the strike will not henceforth
be employed as longshoremen. What
will these men do, or at least, what
will be done with them? But per
haps that is a matter for Upton Sin
clair to worry over.
And so the boats will sail again,
the winches turn again, and the gang
bosses continue to boss. But peace
there is not on the waterfront.
