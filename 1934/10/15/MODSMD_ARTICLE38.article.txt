# Babes Whip San Jose State Yearlings
## FROSH RUN WILD; SCORE FIVE AFTER EVEN FIRST HALF Jimmy Coffis Returns Punt 50 Yards to Goal Line For Longest Gain 
### Warren Breed 
With a .show of offensive power
that accelerated as the game went
on, Stanford Frosh thoroughly waxed
the San Jose State Frosh in the
Northwestern preliminary Saturday,
42 to 6.
Coach Bradshaw's men got un
der way slowly in the first half, with
the State defense showing up fairly
strong. Score at half time ws 7-6.
The Staters began to weaken after
the half, and the babes got rolling
in a procession of five, ten and
Iwenty yard gains, scoring five more
touchdowns.
Frosh linemen played a strong de
fense and steady offensive game,
but the backs showed plenty both
in blocking and carrying the ball.
Bill Paulman, Tom Collins, Jim Cof
fis, Leo Madlem, and Doc Luckett
fattened yardage averages, tearing
off-tackle and skirting the ends
on reverses.
Papooses broke the ice in the first
quarter. Paulman passed to Collins
for 35 yards to take possession of the
ball on the State 25 yard line. Col
lins immediately swept around right
end, finally nailed by the safety
on the four. On two bucks Paulman
shoved it to the one foot line, where
Jimmy Coffis, quarterback, sneaked
it over for the score. Paulman con
verted.
Staters Tally
San Jose countered with six points
in the next period, and Coach Brad
shaw set himself for a tough after
noon. The score came when Bull
Lewis, colored State half, grabbed
fullback Hamilton's throw-away pass
on the Stanford 30. A combined for
ward lateral fooled the Frosh and it
was first and ten on the 16. Lewis
passed ove| the line to Rianda for
the score, but failed to convert.
Touchdowns came easy in the sec
ond half. After a blocked kick,
Coffis and Paulman carried the ball
25 yards on four plays, the latter
reaching pay dirt, find converting.
Dakan Catches Two
A little later Coffis took a low punt
at top speed on the 50 yard line,
raced past the end, swerved to the
right, and shook off several tacklers
in typical Warburton manner, cross
ing the goal standing up, in one of
the nicest runs of the season. Paul
man converted.
With the count 21-6. Luckett and
Hamilton went in, and together with
Collins, marched 55 yards up the
field to score on eight successive
plays. Bob Dakan helped in the im
pressive offensive by snaring two
passes, putting the ball on the 11
yard line. A lateral, Luckett to
Hamilton, went nine yards, and
Collins swept around end for the
score. Collins converted.
All Converts Good
In less than a minute, Hamilton
had scored again, intercepting a
State pass and rambling half the
length of the field behind perfect
interference, then drop-kicking the
conversion.
Leo Madlem counted the final score
oft a tricky reverse from the 31.
Hamilton made the day's conversions
unanimous by making the last one.
'Ends Dakan and Layer played nice
games, as did Cy Oberg at tackle.
Coffis' running-back of kicks pro
vided thrills, and Paulman's quick
kick rivalled that of Frank Alustiza
of the varsity.
The whole show for San Jose was
Bull Lewis, who passed for the
touchdown, made most of the yards
gained, and played a powerful one
man defensive game.
