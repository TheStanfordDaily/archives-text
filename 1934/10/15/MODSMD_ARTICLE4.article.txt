# DEATH CERTAIN FOR SLAV GANG
## 
### 
. PARIS, Oct. 14 (/P).—Sentences of
death appeared today to be the un
avoidable fate of two confessed mem
bers of the Balkan terror band, the
Ustashi, three of whose members,
including a beautiful "gun girl," are
sought by police of eight countries
for complicity in the slayings of
King Alexander and Foreign Min
ister Louis Barthou.
Men Confess
Ivan Rajtich and Zvonemer Pos
pechil, who police said confessed a
share in the plotting against royalty,
were held in jail at Annecy. Fx'ench
authorities were pushing steps to
bring the men to trial for complicity
in Alexander's assassination.
An investigating magistrate at
Marseille conferred with local state
prosecuting attorney where the
prisoners are held and drew up
warrants charging them with com
plicity in the crime. These are to
be sent to Annecy.
Go Slowly
Authorities were proceeding with
caution, since it is admittedly diffi
cult under the French law to prove
complicity, especially in this case as
both men, apparently, were far from
the scene when the assassinations
were committed.
Popechil will be executed in any
case, authorities believe, since he
was under sentence of death in Yu
goslavia for killing a newspaper edi
tor and two policemen. His extradi
tion was considered a simple matter.
It was doubted if Rajtich would come
under the extradition treaty.
Police now believe there were five
men and one woman in the terrorist
band that crossed Europe to kill
Alexander.
VIENNA, Oct. 14 (/P).—The Yugo
slav Legation here said tonight the
real name of King Alexander's assas
sin was not Petrus Kalemen but
Vlada Georgeff Tschernocemckz, a
notorious Macedonian terrorist. He
was a former bodyguard of Ivan
Mihailoff, Macedonian revolutionary
leader now in exile.
