# POLY HIGH SQUAD OUTPLAYS INDIANS ON SOCCER FIELD
## 
### 
An army of midgets, in the form of
the Polytechnic high soccer team,
literally ran circles around the Card
squad in a practice game played on
ihe local field Saturday morning and
emerged victors in score and in qual
ity of soccer played. No score was
kept in compliance with the Univer
sity's rules on practice contests.
The Poly high men, almost to a
man, were smaller than the Stan
j ford players and they dribbled,
twisted and hopped in such an agile
fashion that the Cardinal men seemed
! almost awkward and lumbering by
| comparison.
i After the kickoff, the little men
• started rushing the Indian's goal and
kept dribbling, twisting and hopping
until the center forward, Conway,
finally headed a corner kick into the
| net.
In the second quarter the Cardi
nals began to get used to falling over
! the omnipresent Poly knickers and
I made a few rushes themselves. But
the little men came back with more
twisting and dribbling, and pounded
! in a long shot just before the half
! ended.
In the second half Coach Maloney's
; men almost redeemed themselves
when Mike Gomez scored on a hard
i drive in the third quarter and Dib
| ley completed a passing attack with
a second score. The wee Poly men,
; however, tallied again on a long
; kick and finished up the game more
| than holding their own against the
Indians.
