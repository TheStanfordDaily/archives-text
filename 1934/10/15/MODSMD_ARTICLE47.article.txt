# WEEK-END SCORES ARE REVERSALS OF PRELIMINARY DOPE
## 
### 
Just half of the six important foot
ball games played on the Pacific
Coast over the week-end, exclusive j
of the Stanford-Northwestern af
fair, resulted in upsets, and two oth- :
ers had surprising scores. 1
The first and most amazing of'
these dope reversals occurred Fri
day afternoon in Kezar Stadium, San
Francisco, when Nevada whipped St.
Mary's, 9 to 7. With three minutes
to go, Tom Cashill, center for the
Wolves, kickcd a field goal to win
the game for the little band from
Reno, which repulsed the Gaels' last
minute passing attack and becamc ,
the season's heroes.
Anothei unexpected result was j
Washington's 16 - 6 victory over
Oregon in Portland Saturday. This
was the first time in seven years that
ihe Huskies had even scored on the
Webfeet, co-champions of the Coast
with Stanford last year.
The third upset was the downfall
of Washington State, conqueroi-s of
the Trojans, at the hands of little
Gonzaga, by a margin of 13 to 6. This
game definitely establishes the Bull
dogs from Spokane as good compe
tition for any conference team.
California received an awful scare
in her game with College of the Pa
cific Saturday at Berkeley. Only a
conversion won for the Bears, 7 to
G, after a Pacific man had dashed 75
yards to a touchdown.
Pittsburgh was supposed to beat
Southern California in a tight game,
but few expected a score of 20 to, 6.
The Panthers had all the best of it
over the Trojans throughout.
The only far-western game which
ran true to form was that between
U.C.L.A. and Montana at Los An
geles. The Uclans won, 16 to 0, but
there probably would have been a
much closer score if the game had
been played in the cooler climate of
Missoula.
Two startling reversals occurred in
the Middle West when Notre Dame
defeated Purdue, 19 to 0, and Chicago
ran over Michigan, 27 to 0. Temple
held Indiana to a 6-to-6 tie, but Yale
took the measure of Pennsylvania,
14 to 6.
