# INDIANS, LAKESIDE OPEN WATER POLO PLAY WEDNESDAY
## Stanford Paddlers To Meet U.C.L.A. on Friday 
### 
Only two days remain until the
Stanford varsity water polo team,
champion septet of both the Pacific
Coast Conference and the Northern
California Water Polo League, starts
defense of its titles.
The Lakeside Swimming Club of
Oakland will come to Encina pools
to provide the Indians' first compe
tition of the season at 8 o'clock Wed
nesday evening. Switching back to a
day game the Cards and the U.C.L.A.
Bruins will clash at 4:15 o'clock
Friday afternoon.
Lakeside is certain to give Nort
Thornton's paddlers at least a hard
workout for Friday's game with the
Uclans. The transbay outfit may
prove a lot tougher, however, and
Stanford rates just an even chance
against the strong U.C.L.A. team,
which confidently expects to win.
Both of these aggregations started
practice several weeks in advance of
the Indians, who have been working
out only since October 1. The Cards
have been engaging in some tough
scrimmages recently, however, and'
hope to have enough condition and j
technique to take both contests.
All students will be admitted free j
of charge to these two games, both 1
of which will be open to the public.
