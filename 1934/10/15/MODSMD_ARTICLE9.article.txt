### 

After Colonel Charles Lindbergh appeared before a New Jersey
jury and identified the voice he heard in the cemetary the night the
$50,000 ransom was paid for the return of his already slain baby son,
as that of Bruno Richard Hauptmann, the jury indicted Hauptmann
for murder. Here is Lindbergh (right) with Colonel Schwarzkopf of
the State police, after giving his testimony. (Associated Press photo.)
