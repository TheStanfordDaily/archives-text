# MANAGER CAVE CLAMPS DOWN ON RALLY HATS
## Offers Committeemen Lids But Wants 'Em Back At End of Year 
### Irvin Jorgensen 
What is the resale vaiue of a Rally
Committee hatV Chairman Jacobs
doesn't know, the Rally Committee
doesn't'know. Student Manager Cave
does, but he won't tell.
Cave is busy nursing on a bottle
a puny $12,000 surplus in the A.S.S.U.
coffers, but he has time to leave the
little weakling to figure out how
much he is saving for the A.S.S.U.
on Rally Committee hats so that he
may leave the A.S.S.U. with another
$12,000 to add to the surplus when
he turns the management over to his
successor next June, who will try to
add another $12,000, and—but this
can go on for hours.
Nobody knows what the $12,000 is
going to be used for when it is ac
cumulated, but everyone except the
Rally Committee agrees that it is
"good fun."
The explanation of all this fol-de
rol is a sordid, sordid tale, indeed.
It seems that the Rally Committee
wants hats. Not that this is a par
ticularly strange occurrence. Rally
Committees for years have wanted
hats—and got 'em, too. After all,
Rally Committees are Rally Com
mittees and somebody has to get up
at 7 o'clock in the morning before
the important games and paste little
cards on rooting section seats, and
manage dances to help increase the
$12,000.
The Ex Committee voted last
Tuesday night to give the Rally
Committee hats. Everybody was
happy. But old Dame Sorrow, with
her ol' pal Mephistopheles, cut down
the ranks of the cheerful, and Cave
said the Rally. Committee can have
the hats, but they must sign a little
agreement saying that at the end of
the year the Rally Committee hats
must be turned in to the A.S.S.U.
office to keep the infant $12,000 from
catching cold and crying its old j
lungs out.
You'd cry, too, if your pennies were
being pinched.
