# Macon Crew Will Witness S.C. Game From Air Reveals Commander Wiley
## 
### CEDRIC LARSON 
Probably for the first time in
gridiron history, a huge dirigible will
"park over a football stadium, and
furnish .seals de luxe for the crew
to witness the game. The airship is
the Macon, the stadium Stanford's, |
and the occasion the epic Stanford- j
University of Southern California
clash on October 27th.
These plans were revealed for the
first time late last night by Lieuten- j
ant Commander Herbert V. Wiley of j
ihe Macon, in an interview exclu- I
sively for the Stanford Daily. He
explained that October 27th Ls j
"Navy Day" and the navymen who
navigate the leviathan are to be
given this treat by way of celebra- !
lion.
The Macon last week performed I
-<>me unusual maneuvers out at sea. i
Although many of the objects of the i
trip cannot be divulged, Lieutenant
Commander Wiley gave a resume j

of the trip. The cruise started Mon- »
day, October 8, and ended Thurs- i
day. October 11, covering a distance
of 3500 miles, and consuming nearly
40 tons of gasoline.
Fundamental purpose of the trip
was perfection in scouting maneu
vers, and the ship carried a lull
complement of 72 men. The Macon
chose the gigantic ship Lurline as!
the vessel for which they were in i
quest. Starting out in a dense fog- |
bank, Lieutenant Commander Wi
ley's men located the Lurline in I
record time.
1935 Naval Tactics
Many new delicate instruments'
were tried out on this trip, including '
a recently invented radio-finder, j
Lieutenant Commander Wiley plans
to make another extended trip next
week.
Allhough the plans of the Navy
for the future are cloaked in secrecy, |

these preliminary flights of the
Macon are undoubtedly a prelude to
the gigantic American naval dem
onstration to take place in Alaskan
waters in 1935, for which thousands
of navymen are now being trans
ported to the Pacific area.
Pursuit Planes Deadly
Eight powerful Maybach engines,
manufactured in Germany, drive the
Macon. The framework of Ihe ship is
made of dural, and the girders have
the new box-type construction. The
box-girder proves more sturdy in
the air than the old triangular girder.
Pursuit planes, the offense of the
Macon, are deadly in the extreme.
They are equipped with the latest
triumph of naval engineering skill—
the synchro - precision machine-gun
which fires a steady stream of bullets
through the infinitesimal intervals
of the whirring propeller due to a
highly intricate timing device.
