# GROUP REJECTS ALTERATION OF RUSHING RULES
## Rides, 'Phoning Allowed; "Normal Contact" With Frosh Permitted

(See page 2 for editorial comment)
While pledges roam the country
side in search of female frogs and
signed interviews, fraternity men are
already laying plans for another
lushing season designed to bring a
good portion of the Class of '38 into
the fold. The Interfraternity Coun
cil, meeting last week, considered
rule changes, argued, and left the
rules as they stood last year.
At the ,same time representatives
discussed ways and means of ini
tiating the sophomores already
housed in fraternities. With '"Hell
Week" a designation of the past, they
spoke respectfully of the "pre-ini
liation period," reiterating the regu
lations passed last year. Under the
new system public humiliation of
initiates and destruction of private
property are frowned on.
Discuss Rides
While jockeying for a favorable
position" in the proposed revision of
rushing rules, someone proposed that
driving freshmen around the cam
pus be prohibited, thus preventing
high-pressure methods sometimes
used. Chairman George Cobb then
proposed a "freshman-riding-around
night," which was tabled.
Another suggestion rejected as
superfluous was that all freshmen
wear tags so that, should riding be
prohibited, some freshman would
not be picked up by some tradi
tion-upholding upperclassmen at
the bus slop.
Despite a few objections, the ma
jority agreed that rushing rules as
used last year were satisfiactory, and
that they remain the same, with rides
permissible, telephoning permissible,
and "normal contact" with freshmen
agreeable to all.
