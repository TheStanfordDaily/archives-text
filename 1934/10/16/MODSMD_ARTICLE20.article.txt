Expressing the opinion that any
financial recovery we achieve will
be temporary unless there is co
operation and a free flow of trade
among nations, John B. Condlifle, di
rector of the Economic Intelligence
Service of the League of Nations and
visiting professor at the University
of Michigan, yesterday delivered the
second and last of his economic lec
tures in the Little Theater.
Condlifle compared the pre-war
international trade balance with the
restricted trade going on between
nations today. He cited the years
1870-1914 as "one of the greatest
periods of economic progress the
world has known," and praised the
high standard of living the free
flow of goods made possible.
At present, however, the interna
tional trade balance has been thrown
off key by the depreciation of the
various national currencies. Each na
tion wishes to export more than it
imports in order to keep its money
within its borders. As a result inter
national trade has been slowed tip
considerably and, he pointed out,
unless trade regulations are made
less stringent "there will soon be no
trade to regulate."
