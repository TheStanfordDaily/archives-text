# Dom Hughes Gives Music Talk Today
## Recordings Will Augment Lecture Text 
### 
Devoting his time to a discussion
of the musical works of Henry VI
and other composers of his period,
Reverend Dom Anselm Hughes, Or
der of St. Benedict, distinguished
historian of medieval music, will
speak in the Assembly Hall at 7:30
tonight on "English Choral Music of
the Fifteenth Century." This will be
the second lecture of the Tuesday
evening series.
Dom Hughes will illustrate his lec
ture with phonograph records, the
music of which dates from as far
back as 1300. He comments: "My
chief interest this year is centered
around the compositions of King
Henry VI and the other musicians of
his Royal Chapel. Many of their
songs are of first rate value. The
technical work of these men shows
that they knew as much as we do
about the various types of synco
pation."
A historian as well as a musician,
Dom Hughes is the author of "Me
dieval English Music," "The Music
of King Henry VI and His Circle,"
and "Plain Song." He is secretary
treasurer of the Plainsong and
Medieval Music Society, founded in
1888.
Dom Hughes attended Westmin
ster School and Oxford where h<s
took his B.A. in 1911 and his M.A.
in 1915. In 1922 he joined the Bene
dictine (Anglican) Abbey of Per
shore, Worcetshire. The Abbey was
moved to Nashdom, Burnham, Eng
land, in 1926.
Now on his return journey to
Nashdom Abbey, Dom Hughes has
been lecturing in Australia and New
Zealand for the past several months.
Dom Hughes points out a signifi
cant commentary on the difference
between the days of Henry VI and
the twentieth century. In those days
very often the composer's name was
not given. "Perhaps," says Dom
Hughes, "Men then were content to
write for the glory of their religion
and their art—which they thought of
as one thing and not two separate
things—and were not so anxious
about fame and advertisement." If
their music could only live, their
names might be forgotten, for all
they cared.
Dom Hughes will also speak of two
less well-known song writers, Nich
olas Damett, who has left behind an
exquisite short Latin anthem, and
John Dunstable.
