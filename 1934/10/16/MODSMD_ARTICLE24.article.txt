With five days remaining before
the close of the application period, all
those desiring to enter an essay in
the 1934 Colonial Dames competition
are urged to select a subject, and
file their names with some repre
sentative of the history department
who teaches American history by
Friday.
A number of contestants have al
ready shown their interest in enter
ing this contest by filing their names
with professors, and it is expected
more will do so this week. Dr. Sa
velle (room 23013), Dr. Bailey (2378).
Dr. Bradley (216), or Dr. Barker
(216) may be seen for particulars.
Judges in the faculty of the history
department will award the prize be
fore the end of the quarter. In case
of a tie, the $100 award will be split.
Length does not count in these es
says so much as precision and clar
ity of thought, it is said.
