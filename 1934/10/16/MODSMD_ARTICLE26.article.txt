# Nominations Open For Vacant Posts On Men's Council
## Wisdom of Ex Committee's Election Postponement Questioned, Commented Upon by Council; A.S.S.U. Votes on October 25 
### M. JACK NEWMAN 
As (lie campus hummed with speculation as to whether the postpone
ment of the Men's Council election was well advised or not, the newly
appointed election hoard announced that nominations for the two vacant
council positions would he received today and tomorrow on the law Steps,

t The two posts to be filled are Ihose
left vacant by Gene Brown and Dick
Miles when they failed to return to
school this fall. Qualifications for
the position state that the candidates
j must have completed at least 120
hours of academic work. Those
elected will hold office until the gen
eral election next February.
No Voting Thursday
The election, originally scheduled
for last Thursday, was cancelled at
the last Ex Committee meeting
when that body learned that nobody
had as yet appointed an election
board to handle the polls. The item
of expense of an extra day's bal
i loting entered the considerations and
1 it was decided to postpone the action
j until the fall student body elections,
which v/ill be held on October 25.
The effect of the move on the
efficiency of the council is being
debated by various members of
the student body and the council
itself. There seems to be noticeable
dissention in their views.
In a statement yesterday afternoon
I Council Member Bob Grander ex
pressed himself, "Three will be able
|to function as well as five. We can
I handle all of the business until
! October 25 without the school losing
I anything. The Ex Committee's move
was a legitimate attempt to save
! money."
The Daily has learned that ballots
j would cost five dollars.
Page, Cotton Speak
From A1 Page comes another view
on the subject from the personnel of
i the council. He said, "Postponement
of the Men's Council election which
j was called to fill two vacancies will
delay the organization and the work
|of the council for two weeks. No
permanent officers can be chosen
, until the vacancies are filled. Prob
, ably there will be no meetings
with the freshmen to familiarize the
1 new students with the honor code
I until five members have been se
lected. Furthermore, the two new
members lose out on two weeks of
valuable experience; however, wait
ing for the fall A.S.S.U. elections
j may bring out a more representative
! vote and the associated students will
| save money by delaying the vote."
The opinion voiced by Aylett Cot
ton, third council member, is,
"Though the delay docs slow up the
organization of the council, three
can handle the work that will come
I up until the student body makes its
I choice. The general efficiency of the
, council will not be impaired."
Committee To Decide
Along with his call for nomina
tions, John Brock, chairman of elec
| tions, asked that all propositions that
| are to be considered at the fall
i elections be brought before the Ex
Committee for approval. The propo
! sitions may find their way to a vote
at the election by Ex Committee ap
j proval or if that sanction is not
! given a petition can put it on the
ballot.

cil met yesterday afternoon and con
sidered the cases of traffic violators.
The greater part of the offenses were
| for violating parking ordinances; the
I chemistry path being the spot where
the most violations occurred.
