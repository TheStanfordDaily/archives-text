The news sped from the corners of the earth
yesterday to fuse on the Iront page of a local
metropolitan newspaper into an unconscious
paraphrase of our mad'civilization. The lead
ing stories were concerned in two instances
with murder; in another with a kidnapped
woman.
()ne thousand men in Hungary wanted lo
kill themselves and sabotage a mine in hap
less mass protest against society. China sig
nified her intention of adding fuel to the
burning struggle of international economics.
Further down llie page the news was more
assuring. A (iO-hour transcontinental train
schedule was announced and plans for a trans
pacific air line were revealed.
And that is our "civilization," with a vicious
lag between society and technology thai seems
ever to Increase. Someday lluil lag will be
come intolerable and then scientists will lay
aside their precision instruments, their mi
crometers and log tables and test tubes. They
will lay it all aside and apply their methods
lo man himself, until they learn how we may
prevent hunger and murder and greed and
international stupidity.
I hen we may be able lo cross I he continent
in no less than (Ml or .">(1 or 10 hours but no
incntallv deranged damn fool will shove a

sawed-ofT shotgun in the train window and
turn 011 the Ileal; mothers may let their chil
dren run out to play without tear of kid
nappers. One will not he ahle to ride a light
heam to Europe, but raw materials and pro
duce will be making a slower trip, to the
common benvfit of the whole world.
