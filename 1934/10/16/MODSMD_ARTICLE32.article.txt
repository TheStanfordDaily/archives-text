### BOB JONES 
GOVERNOR LEHMAN OF NEW YORK STATE
Next to the President of the United States, the
Governor of New York State has the most exacting job
in the nation. Holding down this position of precision
is short, squat, bald-headed Herbert Henry Lehman.
A loyal friend of Roosevelt, under whom he made a
telling record as lieutenant-governor. Mr. Lehman car
ries on the Democratic administration at Albany hi the
old but elaborate capitol, which cost $27,000,000, took
27 years to build, and houses a million-dollar staircase.
It was from this same building that three governors
were graduated in the last 49 years to the Presidency—
Cleveland and two Roosevelts: two others just missed—
Hughes and Smith.
In the same building the day before, I attended a
special session of the state senate called to try State
Senator Thayer, chairman of the public utilities com
mittee for supposed irregular dealings with a power
and light company. The accused man was not present.
No defense was made in his behalf. Because he had
resigned shortly after the scandal had been revealed,
he could not be impeached. The senate, however,
could have refused his resignation had the two parties
not decided ahead of time the action of the group.
By a unanimous vote the senator was censured and
convicted of "official misconduct" in office.
When I broke in on Governor Lehman in the middle
of a warm, summer day, he was trying to keep cool
while he worked. His coat was off. His vest was
unbuttoned. He reminded me of a newspaperman at
work.
He started talking about the manner in which the
State of California was "cleaning up" in the athletic
world. Several days before, the California crew had
rowed to victory on the Hudson not far from Albany.
We talked of Stanford and of the men of note I had
been meeting in the East.
He invited me to attend a commutation plea before
him that afternoon for three prisoners, convicted of
murder, awaiting death in Sing Sing. Mrs. Anna An
tonio, one of the three, was electrocuted several months
ago. She was the fourth woman ever to go to the
chair in the state, publicized at the time as being the
mother of three children and yet slated to die in the
dreaded chair. Her children were huddled that after
noon in the Governor's outer office where hang the
portraits of the governors of the Empire State.
The plea was as dramatic as the lawyers could make
it without Mr. Lehman's cracking down on them too
often and demanding that they present facts instead
of playing on his sympathy. Once he dismissed one
of the defense attorneys for giving an overemphasized
"sob sister" story.

A loyal friend of Roosevelt, under whom he made a
telling record as lieutenant-governor. Mr. Lehman car
ries on the Democratic administration at Albany hi the
old but elaborate capitol, which cost $27,000,000, took
27 years to build, and houses a million-dollar staircase.
It was from this same building that three governors
were graduated in the last 49 years to the Presidency—
Cleveland and two Roosevelts: two others just missed—
Hughes and Smith.
In the same building the day before, I attended a
special session of the state senate called to try State
Senator Thayer, chairman of the public utilities com
mittee for supposed irregular dealings with a power
and light company. The accused man was not present.
No defense was made in his behalf. Because he had
resigned shortly after the scandal had been revealed,
he could not be impeached. The senate, however,
could have refused his resignation had the two parties
not decided ahead of time the action of the group.
By a unanimous vote the senator was censured and
convicted of "official misconduct" in office.
When I broke in on Governor Lehman in the middle
of a warm, summer day, he was trying to keep cool
while he worked. His coat was off. His vest was
unbuttoned. He reminded me of a newspaperman at
work.
He started talking about the manner in which the
State of California was "cleaning up" in the athletic
world. Several days before, the California crew had
rowed to victory on the Hudson not far from Albany.
We talked of Stanford and of the men of note I had
been meeting in the East.
He invited me to attend a commutation plea before
him that afternoon for three prisoners, convicted of
murder, awaiting death in Sing Sing. Mrs. Anna An
tonio, one of the three, was electrocuted several months
ago. She was the fourth woman ever to go to the
chair in the state, publicized at the time as being the
mother of three children and yet slated to die in the
dreaded chair. Her children were huddled that after
noon in the Governor's outer office where hang the
portraits of the governors of the Empire State.
The plea was as dramatic as the lawyers could make
it without Mr. Lehman's cracking down on them too
often and demanding that they present facts instead
of playing on his sympathy. Once he dismissed one
of the defense attorneys for giving an overemphasized
"sob sister" story.

GOVERNOR LEHMAN OF NEW YORK STATE
Next to the President of the United States, the
Governor of New York State has the most exacting job
in the nation. Holding down this position of precision
is short, squat, bald-headed Herbert Henry Lehman.
