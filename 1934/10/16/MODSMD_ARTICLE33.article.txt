## POLITICS AND RELIEF—1934 MODEL 
### CROMPTON BANGS, Jr 
BOSTON, Mass., Oct. 15. —The last presidential
campaign was interesting, 1 hough sad for G.0.P.; so
were the 1930 elections. This year when there should
be some excitement over the New Deal pro and con
there is none—politically. This is a strange situation but
one easily explained.
The answer is that the outcome is so certain nobody
is excited about it. The New Deal will win hands
down; Roosevelt's strength in Congress will be as
great as ever, though his popularity has waned some
what lately. The reason that the outcome is certain is
spelt in six letters—RELlEF.
Normally measures so far-reaching as F.R.'s would
be considerably toned down by the off-year Congres
sional elections; ( but normal times are gone for good.
Don't forget that the Federal Government is dishing
out a billion and a half a year to five million families,
which equals six million voters who aren't going to
bite the hand that feeds them. Neither arc 435 Con
gressmen and 32 Senators up for election this year
going to throw a $10,000 job out of the window for the
sake of their scruples.
Obviously the incentive to mix politics and relief
is irresistible; in fact, they have already mixed. It's
supposed to be impolite and ungrateful for Democrats
to talk about this, but your correspondent believes in
the freedom of the press.
There are several reasons why relief and politics
are bedfellows. First, there is the natural incentive of
the jobless to seek political help in getting on the roll;
the man who knows the ropes best is the politician.
Second, the politician of course wants to get the most
votes possible; one of the easiest ways is by helping a
family get on relief. That's the first half of the picture.
Having put the family on relief and gotten their
votes, the politician must keep them (here; just so
long as he does, he will get their support. In addition,
the temptation is strong to get more families on. Relief
administrators everywhere are overloaded by ollice
hungry local politicians.
Of course this sort of thing creates an agency
through which an administration can perpetuate it
self; the temptation to make use of it is irresistible.
Nobody is going to buck the relief voting power. But
someday the money may run out. What will happen
then? It's worth thinlftog about.

are bedfellows. First, there is the natural incentive of
the jobless to seek political help in getting on the roll;
the man who knows the ropes best is the politician.
Second, the politician of course wants to get the most
votes possible; one of the easiest ways is by helping a
family get on relief. That's the first half of the picture.
Having put the family on relief and gotten their
votes, the politician must keep them (here; just so
long as he does, he will get their support. In addition,
the temptation is strong to get more families on. Relief
administrators everywhere are overloaded by ollice
hungry local politicians.
Of course this sort of thing creates an agency
through which an administration can perpetuate it
self; the temptation to make use of it is irresistible.
Nobody is going to buck the relief voting power. But
someday the money may run out. What will happen
then? It's worth thinlftog about.
BOSTON, Mass., Oct. 15. —The last presidential
campaign was interesting, 1 hough sad for G.0.P.; so
were the 1930 elections. This year when there should
be some excitement over the New Deal pro and con
there is none—politically. This is a strange situation but
one easily explained.
The answer is that the outcome is so certain nobody
is excited about it. The New Deal will win hands
down; Roosevelt's strength in Congress will be as
great as ever, though his popularity has waned some
what lately. The reason that the outcome is certain is
spelt in six letters—RELlEF.
Normally measures so far-reaching as F.R.'s would
be considerably toned down by the off-year Congres
sional elections; ( but normal times are gone for good.
Don't forget that the Federal Government is dishing
out a billion and a half a year to five million families,
which equals six million voters who aren't going to
bite the hand that feeds them. Neither arc 435 Con
gressmen and 32 Senators up for election this year
going to throw a $10,000 job out of the window for the
sake of their scruples.
Obviously the incentive to mix politics and relief
is irresistible; in fact, they have already mixed. It's
supposed to be impolite and ungrateful for Democrats
to talk about this, but your correspondent believes in
the freedom of the press.
There are several reasons why relief and politics
are bedfellows. First, there is the natural incentive of
the jobless to seek political help in getting on the roll;
the man who knows the ropes best is the politician.
