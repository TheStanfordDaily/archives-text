This is a sweet littie story, as good I
as fiction, with local color, a sex
j angle, and "pressure from above."
| And to make the story still better,
j the heavy in the super-production is
j none other than the brown sand
' stone Bookstore.
For approximately a year and a'
; half there has been a circulating li- '
S brary book stall in the Cellar. Dur-
I ing almost all of that time it was run
' by a Palo Alto merchant employing
Stanford student help. The stock of
' books was large and varied. The
| stall was well patronized by students
! and faculty*. The thing prospered.
' That was the trouble.

At the end of August, 1934, the
P.A.M. (Palo Alto Merchant) was
told to scram. He had been paying
his rent all right. He had been pay
ing his help all right. But he was
cutting in on the Bookstore mo
nopoly, and what is even worse—
he was selling trash. Of course, stu
dents and faculty had read the trash,
and demanded more of it. But lit
erary trash, like alcoholic grut, was
not for the Stanford campus, though
both could be picked up both in
Palo Alto and on the campus. And
so the "order-to-scram" (Anglo-
Saxon Common Law).
And now the Bookstore makes a
quick entrance from the left wing.
The Bookstore took possession of the
stall and, in 'line with the New Deal',
cut hours of accommodation and
raised 'wages. At the same time the
P.A.M.'s grut was thrown out, the
Bookstore brought in a new line of
select tid-bits —spicier, more blatant,
and cheaper than anything the
P.A.M. had ever contemplated.
Although one of the issues in the
ousting proceedings was the fact
that the tone of the circulating li
brary's literature was very low, the
Bookstore poured in a mass of
tawdry stuff, whose imbecility and
pornography could be appreciated
without bothering to thumb through
a lot of "dry" pages. There were
(and are) the Western pulps. There

was (at least yesterday) Ballyhoo's |
uplifting "Mid - Summer Nudist ,
Number." There was (at least yes
terday) the sporting little Film Fun,
with the usual sporting cover. Col
lege Humor was there (at least yes- j
terday) with two college floozies'
asking: "Why Are College Boys
Dull."

Now we ■ are not a purist. But j
sincfe the trite things are s'd• 'dften j
true: "Consistency IS a Gem. ' If j
the P.A.M. is to be expelled under
the cloud of "low literature," one
should imagine that the Bookstore
would abandon trash, and not try to
go the P.A.M. one better.
Bookstore is consistent in its goug
ing of students, which perhaps de
notes strength of purpose. Oh. Book
store! —Dave MellinkofF.
