"JUDGE PRIEST" (Fox)
At the Stanford Theater
Warmth and easy-going good cheer
are diffused in this picture, in wnich
Will Rogers adds yet another original
!to his "all-American gallery of
; memorable portraits." However, the

Rogers monopoly
meets still com
petition from a ;
smooth support-;
ing cast.
Irvin S. Cobb's
portrait of Judge
Priest, his court,
friends, and en- j

emies, and the little Kentuckian I
town of the 1890's in which they
lived, is authentically re-created. :
The sleepy town, living in the ,
memories of Civil War days, forms I
a colorful background for the series !
of well-done character roles. Of ]
these, Henry B. Walthall's "Deacon" '
was especially outstanding.
The picture "Judge Priest" is a ;
cross-section of human-kind, with
its humor, pathos, romance, and
memories. Sentimental, if you please,
but consistent and convicting enter
tainment.
