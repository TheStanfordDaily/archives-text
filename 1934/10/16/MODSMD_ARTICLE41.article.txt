### 
CARD BACKS COMPARED
TO FOUR HORSEMEN
What 12-year-old kid hasn't heard
of the Four Horsemen of Notre
Danje?
Who knows, maybe ten seasons
fro'lii now 12-year-old junior will
be asking papa what the four-ring
Cardinal circus of 1935 was.
That dream was inspired last Sat
urday as Stanford defeated North
western, 20 to 0, in a rather boring
game which allowed time for en
thusiastic Utopian meditation, and it
refers to a Stanford back fie Id pow
erhouse next year.
MAY BE ONLY A
TIIREE-RING CIRCUS
The most troublesome drawback
is the fact that the duly considered
four-ring circus now has only three
i ings. These, of course, are Frank
Alustiza, Bones Hamilton, and Bob
by Grayson, each a powerhouse in
himself.
To make it complete a fourth
partner must be found. This fourth
man must have at least one year
of competition left, insomuch as
we are thinking of next year's
backfield. lie must be an excep
tional man at safety; he must be
able to block, and lie must be a
a threat when carrying the ball. A
brief knowledge of kicking and
passing would not go amiss in
this ideal fourth man.
There are several possibilities be
ing , considered for this position,
which would be called left halfback.
Bob Maentz and Buck Van Dellen
are in the midst of their last year of
competition, so they can be elim
inated.
Then there will be Johnny Rcis
ner, third string this year, but one
of the speediest safeties on the
squad. Shelly Bronstein, who is
not playing this year because of a
leg injury, will be back and may
crash into the first string. He
sparkled at times last fall, and
could easily add some consistency
and clinch the job.
Then there is a possibility that
Gordon Head will learn the other
halfback job. Other potential first
string members include Jimmy Cof
fis, lresh safety star who has shown
considerable strength in running
back punts, Bill Paulman, Tom
Collins, Doc Luckett, and Glenn
Hamilton, all frosh backs who may
be shifted around to fill in the fourth
place on that Cardinal circus.
THEY'LL BE FAMOUS
IF THINGS GO RIGHT
Assuming then that a fourth man
can be four.d who will do moie
than just be in the line-up, and dis
carding the possibility of injury to
Hamilton, Grayson, or Alustiza, that
combination of 1935 may gain fame
that will require a lot of years for
the average fan to forget.
All ,lhe food for-thought was there,
but it was Hamilton's work Satur
day that, served as the seasoning tc
make that food more palatable.
Bone£ took over the job of full
backing, and he did it brilliantly.
Withcfut Grayson, spark in former
games, even playing, the Cards really
clicked offensively.
So Hamilton, always the star
blocker, has shown that he can
pack a ball and pass almost, if
not entirely, on a par with Gray
son. And he can kick if necessary.
Alustiza gave a few neat ex
hibitions Saturday. His quick kick
ing and passing abilities are univer
sally granted. But Saturday he added
something else by showing that he
is really clever in the open field. He
intercepted a Northwestern pass in
midfield, hovered for a moment while
his interference formed, and then
streaked down the sidelines for a
prettily-executed touchdown.
GRAYSON WON'T BE
ON SPOT AS MUCH
Grayson's qualifications for mem
bership to the Cardinal circus arc
evident. For two years he has done
the major ball-toting, and everyone
watches him, which means he will
be bottled up when he meets a reaily
good, team. But with Alustiza and
Hamilton coming to the fore in this
department, opposite interests will
be diversified.
Gfayson has never really had e
chance to prove his abilities at
blocking; but the abilities are there
nevertheless, and he also can pasf

j ?nd kick. As a freshman he played
| safety, and remarkably well, but his
' other duties are so numerous he
I cannot be spared for that work.
However, with the other backs aid
ing in his offensive work, it is pos
sible that Grayson may be shifted
! to defensive safety.
Here's where the four-ring cir
cus comes in. No matter which of
the backs is in the ball-carrying
| position, the opposition will not
I have a clue as to what kind of
play to expect. It is rather ob
vious that three or four triple
and even quadruple-threat men
are much more valuable than one.
