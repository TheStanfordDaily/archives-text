# GLOOM DISPELLED AS CARDS REPORT IN GOOD CONDITION
## 
### 
The usual week-end nightmare
ended in the usual bright manner
for Coach Tiny Thornhill as his
football players reported nearly 100
per cent for practice yesterday, with
the much-feared injuries having
dwindled to lesser ailments which
will be well in time for Saturday's
game with San Francisco Univer
sity.
Everyone but Woody Adams and
Keith Topping worked out yesterday
in the first practice since the North
western game. Adams' jaw was hurt
early in the season and cracked Sat
urday, which rhearns the fiery guard
will do very little practicing with
the team this week. He may be ready
for combat with the Dons, but
Thornhill will save him for the
U.S.C. game next week if possible.
Topping is hobbling about on
crutches, victim of a sprained ankie.
An examination yesterday indicated
it may be well for the S.F.U. tilt,
and almost certainly will be in shape
for the bigger game with Troy a
week from Saturday.
Adding to Thornhill's poorly con
cealed optimism after the showing
of his Indian team Saturday was the
fact that Bobby Grayson, big as' life,
was romping through signals with
the first string again today after a
lay-off of more than a week. He will
be ready for some work against the
Dons, although Tiny may not take
even a slight chance and hold Bobby
on the sidelines until next week.
Bones Hamilton, another regular
feared to be troubled with an injury,
reported for work with a sore shoul
der, but with little else wrong.
Thornhill continued his. campaign
to stress condition which was in
augurated three weeks ago and ran
his line men through several stiff
drills on fundamentals. The back
field and ends worked on pass and
reverse plays, with timing stressed.
