# POLO SEASON OPENS IN POOL TOMORROW
## 
### 
In the first game of the season !
Stanford's varsity water polo team j
will meet the Lakeside Swimming j
Club of Oakland at 8 o'clock to- 1
morrow night in Encina pools.
The Lakeside team is strongest j
on defense, as the Olympic Club had i
trouble scoring against them. How
ever, the veteran Card aquatic stars, j
led by Captain Leo Cook, should j
break through for frequent goals if j
they play up to their practice form.
Lakeside's ace is Gordon Corson,
a former Oregon star. California
conquered the transbay seven by a
margin of 9 to 2, and the Olympic
Club holds two decisions over Lake
side, 6 to 3 and 4 to 0. Stanford
intends to use the Lakeside game
as good practice for Friday's game
with U.C.L.A.
Unless the Oakland aggregation is
much stronger than expected, Coach
: Nort Thornton will use as many men
as possible in order to get a good
; line on the ability of the Indian re
; serves under fire.
There will be no admission charge
to this clash, which will be followed
by a game between the junior var
i sities of the two organizations. Many
women are expected to attend this
game, which will be the first one in
which water polo will be a separate
sport, v totally distinct from swim-
I ming.
