# INTEREST FOCUSES ON EASTERN BALL GAMES THIS WEEK
## Indian-Don Clash Receives Coast Attention 
### 
With the East defending itself
against a Western and Midwestern
invasion and the elimination certain
of at least one strong contender for
the national gridiron title, the eye
of the football camera will be fo
cused on the East this week-end.
At Pittsburg, Dr. Jock Suther
land's Pitt Panthers, rated the
strongest squad in the East, will meet
Minnesota, undefeated; four times
tied in 1933. Since the Gopher line
up of last season returns intact with
the exception of Ray Oen, center,
Minnesota must be considered a
strong contender for national hon
ors.
St. Mary's, knocked over by the
hitherto unheralded Nevadans
last Saturday, is on its way East
to play Fordham at New York
where the Gaels put on such a
great show for Eastern sportswrit
ers last year. Michigan Stale, mak
ing a determined bid for national
recognition, having beaten Michi
gan and Carnegie Tech on succes
sive Saturdays, will play Man
hattan.
In other Eastern games, Elmer
Layden's Notre Dame squad, which
started to click Saturday against
Purdue, will meet Carnegie Tech,
Ohio State plays Colgate, and Co
lumbia, not as strong as last season,
tangles with the Navy.
Two important games are carded
in the Midwest where Chicago meets
Indiana and Purdue plays Wiscon
sin. Chicago, after running up the
biggest score the Maroons have
made against a Michigan team this
century, 27 to 0, must be counted
one of the Big Ten's best elevens.
Michigan will attempt the come
back trail after two consecutive
losses when the Wolverines travel
south to play Georgia Tech, de
feated last Saturday 20 to 0 by
Duke. Harry Kipke's 1933 Big Ten
champions apparently have lost all
but the prayer in their "pass,
punt, and pray" system.

where the Gaels put on such a
great show for Eastern sportswrit
ers last year. Michigan Stale, mak
ing a determined bid for national
recognition, having beaten Michi
gan and Carnegie Tech on succes
sive Saturdays, will play Man
hattan.
In other Eastern games, Elmer
Layden's Notre Dame squad, which
started to click Saturday against
Purdue, will meet Carnegie Tech,
Ohio State plays Colgate, and Co
lumbia, not as strong as last season,
tangles with the Navy.
Two important games are carded
in the Midwest where Chicago meets
Indiana and Purdue plays Wiscon
sin. Chicago, after running up the
biggest score the Maroons have
made against a Michigan team this
century, 27 to 0, must be counted
one of the Big Ten's best elevens.
Michigan will attempt the come
back trail after two consecutive
losses when the Wolverines travel
south to play Georgia Tech, de
feated last Saturday 20 to 0 by
Duke. Harry Kipke's 1933 Big Ten
champions apparently have lost all
but the prayer in their "pass,
punt, and pray" system.
Out here on the Coast Stanford's
game with U.S.F. takes the spot
light as the vastly improved Dons
: attempt to wreck the Indians' un

Ferasiboa, a little island in the Pa
cific, is inhabited entirely by women
Any man who sets foot on its shores
runs the risk of beiDg eaten, for the
women are canibals.
With the East defending itself
against a Western and Midwestern
invasion and the elimination certain
of at least one strong contender for
the national gridiron title, the eye
of the football camera will be fo
cused on the East this week-end.
At Pittsburg, Dr. Jock Suther
land's Pitt Panthers, rated the
strongest squad in the East, will meet
Minnesota, undefeated; four times
tied in 1933. Since the Gopher line
up of last season returns intact with
the exception of Ray Oen, center,
Minnesota must be considered a
strong contender for national hon
ors.
St. Mary's, knocked over by the
hitherto unheralded Nevadans
last Saturday, is on its way East
to play Fordham at New York
where the Gaels put on such a
