# STUDENTS NEGLECT FINE FEATURES OF STANFORD MUSEUM
## 
### 
When Senator and Mrs. Stanford
determined to build a memorial to
their son, they were at first un
decided whether it should take the
form of a museum or a university.
The result is a university with a
museum which is seldom visited by
students, despite the fact that the
Museum's budget depends entirely
upon the number of its visitors.
The nucleus of the Museum is
Leland Stanford Jr.'s own collection
which he bought piece by piece in
Europe and kept at his home in San
Francisco when "the Farm" was the
Stanford's summer home. However
most of the material was collected
by Mrs. Stanford after the death
of Leland in his sixteenth year.
Other contributions have been added
since then, attracting those interested
in anything from prehistoric to mod
ern times.
The Egyptian room is said by sev
eral leading world Egyptologists who
have visited it to contain an excel
lent collection. The selection of
Greek pottery includes a vase
which draws archaeologists the
world over to the Stanford campus.
People intrigued by China and
Japan may spend their time in the
oriental room, while others, inter
ested in the history of America
may see everything from a check
signed by Washington to the "Gov
ernor Stanford No. .1" the first loco
motive to go across the famous
central Pacific Railroad. Work of
the California, Navajo, and Pueblo
Indians is also presented.
Among the countries represented
in the Museum are France, Italy,

Piussia, Germany, Spain, Czecho
slovakia, Africa, Mexico, and the
Philippines.
