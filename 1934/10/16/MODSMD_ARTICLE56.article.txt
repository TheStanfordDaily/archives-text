# TROWBRIDGE SEES ENOUGH WATER FOR STANFORD CAMPUS
## 
### 
In spite of the nationwide drouth,
portrayed in the newsreeb by emaci
ated cows and dried corn, and the
extreme heat of the past summer,
Stanford will not suffer from lack of
water.
Alfred L. Trowbridge, Assistant
Comptroller, stated that, although
the reservoirs of water which Stan
ford utilizes are low, this state is
due merely to the natural condi
tions prevalent toward the end of
the seasons.
The principal water supply for
Cardinal ablutions and drinking is
obtained from ground water and
wells. The irrigating water, used on
the flora of the Farm, comes from the
San Francisquito Creek and its
tinbutaries. If the Creek is low, as
it tends to be this year, water is
taken from the reservoirs to keep
the shrubbery green and the flowers
blooming.
Thus, despite the arid (aquatically
speaking) country, the Stanford
rough need not fear a lack of the
cleansing fluid for the weekly bath
or the daily drink.
