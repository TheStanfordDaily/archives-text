# THORNTON BRINGS REPERTORY GROUP TO FARM NOV. 11
## Campus To Be Presented Shakespearean Plays 
### 
William Thornton, former Stan
ford student and one of America's
beat-known Shakespearean actors, j
will give two performances on the I
campus on November 14.
The selection will be made from
the following list: "King Lear," ;
"Richard III," "Hamlet," "The Mer
chant of Venice" and "The Taming of j
Ihe Shrew." It is probable that one
of the first two will be chosen for
the evening, and one of the last two!
for the afternoon. The English Clubi
reserves the right to the final de- '
cision.
Actors All Young
The matinee will begin at 3:30 and j
the evening performance at 8:30. The j
comparatively late hour set for the i
afternoon presentation will be fori
the accommodation of Palo Alto
school children.
The cast supporting Thornton is
very young. Thornton himself is
under 30; only two players are
over ."50; four arc under 21. They '
act in a fresh, free styleâ€”different
from the stiff, stilted manner of the
older Shakespearean actors.
In the cast is Robert Brauns, who
participated in all three of the Sword
and Saridals readings of the past
summer. Playing bit parts will be
Frances Slanina whose work at the
University has centered about the
Romanic languagese department.
Attended Stanford
While attending Stanford, Thorn
ton appeared in several dramatic
productions. It was then, a decade
ago, that he got his first experience
in playing the famous characters of
Shakespeare's creations. He was
cast in "Macbeth" when it was first
given on the campus and played
Polonius in a modern dress version
of "Hamlet."
In approving Thornton's appearing
at Stanford on November 14, Ralph
Pincus, manager of the Columbia
Theater in San Francisco, made a
special dispensation. He rarely
agrees to an actor's showing else
where in the vicinity within two
weeks after the completion of a run
at the Columbia.
Thornton's appearance on the
campus will be sponsored by the
English Club. The company is pre
sented by the Shakespeare Guild of
America.
