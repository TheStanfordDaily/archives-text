Nathan Van Patten, director of
j University libraries, spoke on "The
| Library's Part in the Educational
| System" during the Stanford Hour
: broadcast last night over station
KGO.
"As an educational agency, in its
' own right, the library alone provides
1 a comprehensive opportunity for
j self-education." Starting with this
j statement, Van Patten proceeded to a
j discussion of the history of writing
from its inception, at the photo
[ graphic stage, through the ideo
graphic and phonetic stages.
Man could make but little progress
when the transmission of knowledge
was dependent upon verbal com
munication alone. Johannes Guten
berg's famous printed bible in 1455
is the first landmark reached by
[ western civilization in the art of
i printing. The advancement of all
! knowledge depends upon the utiliâ€”
| zation of past experience and the
: existence of manuscript and printed
I books has made this possible.
Van Patten discounted the popu
i !ar belief that an education institu
| tion possesses some magical means
| of taking unto itself an uneducated
| man and in due course sendiiig him
| forth an educated one,through the
' application of certain measures
i thought of rather hazily as "edtica
| tional processes."
All education is self-education.
The school, the college, can do no
more than offer superior facilities for
self-education through the medium
of its lectures, its laboratories, its
museums, and its libraries.
Van Patten mentioned the out
standing collections which Califor
nia, a comparatively young com
monwealth, possesses: the Hunting
ton Library at Pasadena, the Ban
croft Library at Berkeley, and the
Hoover War Library at Stanford.
