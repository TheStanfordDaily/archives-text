## 
### 
Notice: Anyone who sees a strange
looking airplane featuring an "in
verted stagger" and running circles
around the Palo Alto School of Avia
tion landing field tomorrow morning,
need not be alarmed. It will only be ,
Mrs. Louise Thaden, noted woman
pilot, who plans to demonstrate her
new "Beechcraft" at the local air- |
port tomorrow from 10 to 11 o'clock, j
"Beechcraft" is a radical depar- 1
ture from the conventional airplane
and is one of the fastest commercial
ships in the air. Chief among its in
novations is the "inverted stagger,"
that is placing the top wing to the
rear of the pilot.
