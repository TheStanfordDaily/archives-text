The Quad staff swings into full

begin for student photography. A
new studio system will be used, and
Fisher Studio from San Francisco,
the same artists who took last year's
Quad pictures, will again be on
hand.
Quad staff members will begin
making appointments for photo
graphs in various living groups to
morrow. Last year's system 6f sign
ing appointment sheets will be used.
"This system has proved the most
satisfactory to students and to us of
any that has been used, and we ask
co-operation," said Everett. Moses,
editor.
