# ACTIVITY HEADS APPEAR BEFORE STUDENT GROUP
## Tomorrow's Assembly Has Talks, Tumbling Acts, Music Numbers 
### 
For the enlightenment and enter
tainment of freshmen at the hands of
student leaders, there will be an
all-university assembly taking the
place of 11 o'clock classes tomorrow.
Several prominent students repre
senting nearly every activity in the
extra-curricular program will give
short talks, explaining how the va
rious student organizations function.
Several other officials will be intro
duced.
Activities Explained
The motive for the assembly is to
acquaint the new students with the
campus leaders and activities and to
explain how newcomers may get
started in the various activities.
Interspersed in the* rapid-fire
speaking program will be numbers
by the Stanford band and exhibitions
by the tumbling team.
Student President Marvic Kahn
yesterday made the statement that
he believed it would be of distinct
advantage for all freshmen and
new students, and also the other
university men and women, to at
tend the assembly.
It is the first occasion for the
campus "big guns" to face the stu
dent body and the only opportunity
of the year for the student body to
see the whole "big gun" squad in
united action.
Leading off the program will be
Helen Ray, vice-president of the
A.S.S.U., who will tell of customs or
"traditions," as they are more fa
miliarly known. Gordon Steedman,
"Old Boy" editor of the Stanford
Chaparral, will follow Miss Ray,
telling of campus publications which
include the Daily, Chappie, Quad
and, perhaps, News. Dave Bassett,
president of the glee club, will give
the third talk, explaining musical ac
tivities.

the Stanford band will render sev
eral selections. The next two speak
ers and their subjects are: Marion
Storey, chairman of the women's
council, telling of David Starr Jor
dan; and Bob Grantier, chairman
pro tem of men's council, speaking
on debate.
Another interlude in the program
will follow with the stage being
cleared for tumbling team stunts.
The last trio of speakers will be:

A.S.S.U., explaining the Stanford
honor code; and George Lee, mem
