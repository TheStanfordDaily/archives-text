# PAN-HEL NAMES RUSHING DATES
## Group To Decide Number Of Pledges Per House 
### 
Pan-Hellenic yesterday settled the
question of just how many girls each
house will be permitted to pledge
this year. The present rule—that of
limiting the total number of girls in
each house to 30 —would have placed
some houses in the rather annoying
position of having too many girls
to begin with. Representatives from
the houses will confer with Dean
Mary Yost to determine the exact
number, as each house has a sepa
rate problem.
Graduate women arc to be gov
erned by the same regulations in
associating with the Row women
as the How women with the grad
uates. Thus* a graduate is not en
titled to make a luncheon date, or
phone a sorority woman, or vice
versa.
Dates for the rushing teas for
transfer women are November 16
and 18, and for freshman teas De
cember 7, 8, and 9.
Regular rushing luncheon and
dinner dates will begin on January
4, 5, and 7, with a rest period of two
days, resuming again on January 9
and 10. Pledging will follow on Jan
uary 11.
