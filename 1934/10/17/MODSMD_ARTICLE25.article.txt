### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 16 (/P).â€”Millard
Whited, a Jersey farmer and lum
berman, tapped Bruno Richard
Hauptmann on the shoulder in a
Bronx Supreme Court today, and
identified him as the "stranger" he
saw on two occasions near the Hope
well home of Charles A. Lindbergh
in the two weeks before the flyer's
first-born son was abducted and
slain.
With this dramatic identification
Attorney-General David T. Wilentz
of New Jersey rested his State's de
mand for the extradition of the alien
ex-convict to stand trial for the
baby's murder, after which the jus
tice granted a stay of execution on
the extradition until 4 p.m., Octo
ber 19.
