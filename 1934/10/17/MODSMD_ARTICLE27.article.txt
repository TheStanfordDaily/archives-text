# INJURED CARDS BETTER AS DON CONTEST NEARS
## U.S.F. Waiting To Surprise Not-So-Sick Stanford Team Saturday TOPPING, ADAMS OUT Indians Not Over-Confident For Tilt at Kezar 
### Millard Browne 
They almost did it last year, did
those Dons of the University of San
Francisco, and they wouldn't mind
! finishing the job thi.s week-end
when they greet the Stanford In
] dians in Kezar Stadium.
The Dons will be underdogs, and
I they don't mind that in the least.
| They'd rather strike with kind of a
j surprise, like. But even though
j his team will be favored, Coach
j Tiny Thornhill will not permit
that to let the Cardinals ease up,
even a trifle.
And none of those Cardinals have
shown any intentions of easing up.
I They remember all the fun they had
j in Kezar last year about this time
| just after they returned from Chi
cago. Also, they realize that they
have only barely begun a definite
job, and that Saturday must be just
another part of that job, but that it
must be a part well done in order lo
j make the entire work satisfactory.
So with his men favored, and that
fact doing no particular harm—or
good — Coach Thornhill is going
ahead with the routine preparations
for the rest of the Cardinal gridiron
campaign. He is not ignoring S.F.U.
one little bit, but even this week he
also is not ignoring U.S.C., or Wash-
I ington ,or California, or U.C.L.A-
Injured List Shrinks
j Saturday, after the Northwestern
I game, Woody Adams, Bones Hamil
ton, Keith Topping, Bobby Grayson,
Gordon Head, and Frankie Alustiza
were announced as probably too
crippled to play against the Dons.
Following Monday's practice,
Hamilton, Grayson, and Alustiza
were removed from this list. An
other day's workout served to re
move Head's name, leaving only
I Adams and Topping as definitely
j out of the S.F.U. clash.
Adams reported for practice, in
full football dress, but he took no
part in scrimmage or active play, and
his cracked jaw is figured enough
to keep him on the sidelines at least,
until the U.S.C. clash next week.
Topping was hobbling about with a
sprained ankle yesterday and almost
surely will not be ready for the
Dons.

Injured List Shrinks
j Saturday, after the Northwestern
I game, Woody Adams, Bones Hamil
ton, Keith Topping, Bobby Grayson,
Gordon Head, and Frankie Alustiza
were announced as probably too
crippled to play against the Dons.
Following Monday's practice,
Hamilton, Grayson, and Alustiza
were removed from this list. An
other day's workout served to re
move Head's name, leaving only
I Adams and Topping as definitely
j out of the S.F.U. clash.
Adams reported for practice, in
full football dress, but he took no
part in scrimmage or active play, and
his cracked jaw is figured enough
to keep him on the sidelines at least,
until the U.S.C. clash next week.
Topping was hobbling about with a
sprained ankle yesterday and almost
surely will not be ready for the
Dons.
