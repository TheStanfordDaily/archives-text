# EX COMMITTEE, WILBUR TO MEET
## Problems of New Theater To Be Talked Over 
### 
In the first official meeting be
tween the administration and stu
dents on the subject of the pro
posed hew theater the Ex Committee
and members of the theater commit
tee will confer with President Wil
bur in his office this afternoon at 3
o'clock.
It is Dr. Wilbur's wish to talk
over various questions in regard
to (lie theater with the student offi
cials in order that the administra
tion can get a definite idea of the
various theater problems. The
question of size, facilities, and fi
nancing will be discussed at this
afternoon's meeting.
Last spring the Associated Stu
dents, incited by general campus
opinion and an intensive campaign
on the part of the Daily, voted to
add a dollar and a quarter to the stu
dent dues paid with tuition. This
fund will start accumulating next
quarter when the tuition will be
raised to $115. Student officials hope
that the meeting today will lead to
some definite action toward co-op
eration between the university and
the A.S.S.U. in the construction of
the theater.
