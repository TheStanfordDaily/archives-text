about proselyting of athletes because the Daily

Even on the Farm, we have our own opin

Somebody told the Daily C.alifornian that an
other somebody (I'.S.C. publicity director)
had remarked that the Bears were "hijacking"
athletes.
So, the Daily Californian very nicely jams
the'eustomary paw into the yawning jaws of
impulse and attempts to excuse the charge,
not denying it, by blaming the entire situation
on another institution.

A nice, amusing scrap seems to be headed
Ibis way, with a lot of dirty laundry to be
washed pretty thoroughly in a most public
manner. The Daily Californian screams that
Southern California started a practice and
implies that California might possibly have
followed suit to protect its own interests. And
we are happy to learn that Berkeley is nursing

Battle away, ye hearties. The Indians will
still be there with a bunch of pretty good
amateurs who can give a very adequate ac
