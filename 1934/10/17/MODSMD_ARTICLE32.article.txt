# Recoveryâ€”Fundamental or Superficial?

### 
Dr. John 15. C.ondlilie's recent group of
lectures, completed yesterday afternoon, em
phasizes a fact that most economists know nil
too well, namely, that attempts to bring back
world economic stability can succeed only by
i nlcni;t I iona I co-opera lion.
Kach nation, with varying success, is val
iantly attempting to lift itself back to pros
perity by ils own bootstraps. By individual,
nationalistic cll'orts we are trying to remedy
a condition that has its roots in underlying
causes that are distinctly international in
character.
The bewildering maze of war debts, repa
rations, protective tariffs, and monetary in
slabilily lias created a situation that defies Ihe
uncoordinated elTorls of national leaders, no
matter how sincere, how determined or how
talented they may be. Such ell'orls can and
do succeed temporarily but Hie inevitable
reckoning must come.
Certain nations, such as the t nilcd Slates,
can isolate themselves from Ihe world and
be almost entirely sell-siillieienl bv means of

restrictions and emimrtfoes. But such a
course carries with it severe penalties and
readjustments that hysterical advocates of
"Buy American" are unwilling to accept. II
would mean the complete scrapping of cer
tain industries that depend upon import or
export trade.
Fundamental economic soundness depends,
obviously, upon international co-operation.
One such effort, the World Economic Confer
ence of 1933, was wrecked hv national self
interests, probably justifiable under the cir
cumstances.
Intensified nationalism of the past year
create even greater havoc should tin
other attempt be made. Nevertheless the
cause of permanent recovery seems to demand
at least one more effort. Perhaps the millen
nium of world co-operation will come this
time.
