## WITH EDWIN A. COTTRELL 
### CHARLOTTE BURRIDGE 
With expiration date of the NRA trial period draw
ing closer, more and more discussion of the Blue Eagle
is being heard everywhere. Griping is a most enjoy
able indoor sport, and political authorities as well as
Mr. Average Citizen will have eight months longer
to air their troubles. Dissatisfaction wilh the NRA as
it is now operating is rather general, but a large group
of governmental authorities as well as the laboring
class strongly favor certain of the "New Deal" policies
although not in sympathy with all of its endeavors.
Edwin A. CottrelL professor of political science, is
one of this group. After attending the Government
Research Conference at Lake George, N.Y., and the
Conference of Industrial Relations at Princeton, N.J.,
Professor Cottrell is in a position to thoroughly under
stand the present storm of "pros and cons" on the
NRA. He believes thai the Blue Eagle as such will
be discarded, but that the principles of the NRA will
remain.
"There are certain features that will perma
nently be retained: minimum wage, child labor
abolishment, higher standard of living, unfair prac
tice clauses, collective bargaining with some pro
tection for employer as is now provided for em
ployee against coercion and intimidation."
Whether or not the NRA alone is responsible for
these successful measures is debatable. Of course they
might have come about anyway, 'but tht* Codes and
Blue Eagle have at least definitely stimulated interest.
"The United States may reached the same degree in
the end, but the New Deal has caused the action to
come more quickly," the political scientist states.
The Blue Eagle was originally intended to put
people back to work. The idea was to raise produc
tion, put people to work, cut hours and spread the
work to more people. This was designed to increase
purchasing power, in order to "sop up" the larger
production.
The question that apparently was not consid
ered was whether or not we needed to produce
more; in lots of cases we did not. Cottrell believes
that one of the greatest drawbacks to recovery is
the fact that the government cannot stimulate
industries that employ a large number.
"During operaion of the NRA five million people
not including PWA, and CWA activities were put
back to work—but that doesn't mean that it was per
manent," Cottrell adds. "
The program of the NRA. AAA, and others of the
New Deal alphabetical league was intended to con
serve the rights of both capital and labor through
collective bargaining and at the same time have equal
regard for the consumer.
"The sore spot of the whofe program is that they
have tried to interpret Section 7-A as giving indus
trial (trade) unions priority in bargaining."
PWA did not work as it was expected to. Not
enough higher class positions were created and as a
result the depression has hit the intellectual and cul
tured class hardest.
"As a whole, there lias been an improvement
under the NRA but there still exists too much fear
.of inflation for industry to expand to its normal
condition," he says.
"All fixed prices will be abolished. Neither the
Blue Eagle or codes will remain as long as they provide
for closed prices and intimidation of labor or con
sumer."
The professor's generalization that "industry and
labor want the NRA" is based on his extensive study
during the past summer and can be accepted as a
reflection of the feeling of the nation as a whole.

PWA did not work as it was expected to. Not
enough higher class positions were created and as a
result the depression has hit the intellectual and cul

"As a whole, there lias been an improvement
under the NRA but there still exists too much fear

condition," he says.
"All fixed prices will be abolished. Neither the

The professor's generalization that "industry and
labor want the NRA" is based on his extensive study
during the past summer and can be accepted as a
reflection of the feeling of the nation as a whole.
With expiration date of the NRA trial period draw
ing closer, more and more discussion of the Blue Eagle
is being heard everywhere. Griping is a most enjoy
able indoor sport, and political authorities as well as
Mr. Average Citizen will have eight months longer
to air their troubles. Dissatisfaction wilh the NRA as
it is now operating is rather general, but a large group
of governmental authorities as well as the laboring
class strongly favor certain of the "New Deal" policies
although not in sympathy with all of its endeavors.
Edwin A. CottrelL professor of political science, is
one of this group. After attending the Government
Research Conference at Lake George, N.Y., and the
Conference of Industrial Relations at Princeton, N.J.,
Professor Cottrell is in a position to thoroughly under
stand the present storm of "pros and cons" on the
NRA. He believes thai the Blue Eagle as such will
be discarded, but that the principles of the NRA will
remain.
"There are certain features that will perma
nently be retained: minimum wage, child labor
abolishment, higher standard of living, unfair prac
tice clauses, collective bargaining with some pro
tection for employer as is now provided for em
ployee against coercion and intimidation."
Whether or not the NRA alone is responsible for
these successful measures is debatable. Of course they
might have come about anyway, 'but tht* Codes and
Blue Eagle have at least definitely stimulated interest.
"The United States may reached the same degree in
the end, but the New Deal has caused the action to
come more quickly," the political scientist states.
The Blue Eagle was originally intended to put
people back to work. The idea was to raise produc
tion, put people to work, cut hours and spread the
work to more people. This was designed to increase
purchasing power, in order to "sop up" the larger
production.
The question that apparently was not consid
ered was whether or not we needed to produce
more; in lots of cases we did not. Cottrell believes
that one of the greatest drawbacks to recovery is
the fact that the government cannot stimulate
industries that employ a large number.
"During operaion of the NRA five million people
not including PWA, and CWA activities were put
back to work—but that doesn't mean that it was per
manent," Cottrell adds. "
The program of the NRA. AAA, and others of the
New Deal alphabetical league was intended to con
serve the rights of both capital and labor through
collective bargaining and at the same time have equal
regard for the consumer.
"The sore spot of the whofe program is that they
have tried to interpret Section 7-A as giving indus
trial (trade) unions priority in bargaining."
