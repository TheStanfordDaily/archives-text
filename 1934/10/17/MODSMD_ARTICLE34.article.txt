## WALTER LIPPMAN, COMMENTATOR 
### BOB JONES 
remaps the most influential journalist ot our lime :
is Walter Lippman, publicist and interpreter of events.
Read by President Roosevelt, Mr. Lippman's column is j
syndicated to 126 American dailies, including news- |
papers in Alaska, the Hawaiian Islands, and the Philip
pines with a total circulation of 8.000,000, plus further
publication abroad.
I visited him one afternoon in June at his office in
the Herald-Tribune building in New York. His office
fitted him. Several rows of books neatly placed, ihen
more books, yet his office was no musty affair but j
one equipped simply and with the necessary tools, j
When I looked quizzically at so many books, he smiled
and said that he had scarcely examined most of them.
They were sent to him by publishers.
Mr. Lippman appears young (45) for the posi
tion he holds and for the influence lie wields. He
can be quoted on either side of almost any ques
tion. His style, simple and yet assured, carries
force and conviction by its quiet authority and tem
perance. That style impresses the reader as being
speech at considered leisure.
His political background, needed for his articles, in
terested me. He had his first taste of politics when he j
was secretary to a Socialist mayor of Schenectady, j
Later he went to Washington where he worked during i
the War in one of the Departments. For political writ
ers he advised strongly the getting of a post in some
important politician's office "to see Ihe wheels go j
'round."
Statesmen even come to him for advice <>r read his i
column for the same. It was uncanny to politicians to
see how exact his predictions were. One such individual
told me so.
It is reported that if one man had followed Mr.
Lippman's advice at the correct time, he would have
been governor of New York State instead of Roose
velt in 1!)2X! The importance of that decision with
the ensuing national events seems unbelievable
now.
The distinguished writer advised all college students I
with ideas of writing to take a Course in logic. "Only," |
he added, "if the professor is good. Otherwise the
course would be useless."

and said that he had scarcely examined most of them.
They were sent to him by publishers.
Mr. Lippman appears young (45) for the posi
tion he holds and for the influence lie wields. He
can be quoted on either side of almost any ques
tion. His style, simple and yet assured, carries
force and conviction by its quiet authority and tem
perance. That style impresses the reader as being
speech at considered leisure.
His political background, needed for his articles, in
terested me. He had his first taste of politics when he j
was secretary to a Socialist mayor of Schenectady, j
Later he went to Washington where he worked during i
the War in one of the Departments. For political writ
ers he advised strongly the getting of a post in some
important politician's office "to see Ihe wheels go j
'round."
Statesmen even come to him for advice <>r read his i
column for the same. It was uncanny to politicians to
see how exact his predictions were. One such individual
told me so.
It is reported that if one man had followed Mr.
Lippman's advice at the correct time, he would have
been governor of New York State instead of Roose
velt in 1!)2X! The importance of that decision with
the ensuing national events seems unbelievable
now.
The distinguished writer advised all college students I
with ideas of writing to take a Course in logic. "Only," |
he added, "if the professor is good. Otherwise the
course would be useless."
