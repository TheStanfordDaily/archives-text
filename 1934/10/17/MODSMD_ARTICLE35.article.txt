# BULL SESSION
## STRAWMEN IN THE BREEZE 
### 
For years Stanford professors of'
i political science have urged genera
| tions of Stanford men and women to
I be wary of political hokum. It is
' known to everyone that in the
"great game of politics" the chief
object of a campaign is to so becloud
the major issues at stake that the
| populace will be flub-dubbed into
voting for a pleasant smile, a sweet
j gardenia, or a homespun American
I name.
The present campaign in California
does not differ in this sense from j
any other campaign. The clouds of
political smoke in California in
i crease day by day. The Golden State
! will soon be smokier than Pitts
j burgh—with Bethlehem Steel run
| ning at 1929 capacity.
But unfortunately the warnings of
i the professors — like those of the
j prophets of old —have fallen on deaf
j ears. Stanford is swallowing the
j hokum, and clamoring for more.
A number of years ago Mr. Upton
| Sinclair—in one of his more exhu
! berant moods—dashed off a treatise
I which he dubbed "The Goose Step."

The thing was meant to be a simply
crushing blow to university big
wigs. Stanford was "crushed"; U S.C.
was "crushed"; so were many other
institutions of higher and lower
learning. We are not sure about j
S.C., but we know that Stanford at i
least has lived through the "crush
ing," despite the fact that there was
both truth and falsity in the "Goose-
Step" references to the Farm.
Yet now —10 years later—when
the prime issue in the California
gubernatorial campaign is "unem
ployment" and not alleged B.A.C.
corruption, Republican mediums
have conjured up the ghost of the
"Goose-Step" to frighten Stanford
participants in the political seance.
It is a fi)ls2 loyalty to Stanford
that would prime Stanford students |
or adherents to defend with their
votes the maligned personalities of
ten years ago. As we have suggested
before, Stanford voters should care
not whether Sinclair is a vegetarian
or has halitosis, or whether he
"Hates Cal" or "Hates Stanford."
What can he do? What will he do?
Those are the only questions.

before, Stanford voters should care
not whether Sinclair is a vegetarian
or has halitosis, or whether he
"Hates Cal" or "Hates Stanford."
What can he do? What will he do?
Those are the only questions.

For years Stanford professors of'
i political science have urged genera
| tions of Stanford men and women to
I be wary of political hokum. It is
' known to everyone that in the
"great game of politics" the chief
object of a campaign is to so becloud
the major issues at stake that the
| populace will be flub-dubbed into
voting for a pleasant smile, a sweet
j gardenia, or a homespun American
I name.
The present campaign in California
does not differ in this sense from j
any other campaign. The clouds of
political smoke in California in
i crease day by day. The Golden State
! will soon be smokier than Pitts
j burgh—with Bethlehem Steel run
| ning at 1929 capacity.
But unfortunately the warnings of
i the professors — like those of the
j prophets of old —have fallen on deaf
j ears. Stanford is swallowing the
j hokum, and clamoring for more.
A number of years ago Mr. Upton
| Sinclair—in one of his more exhu
! berant moods—dashed off a treatise
I which he dubbed "The Goose Step."

The thing was meant to be a simply
crushing blow to university big
wigs. Stanford was "crushed"; U S.C.
was "crushed"; so were many other
institutions of higher and lower
learning. We are not sure about j
S.C., but we know that Stanford at i
least has lived through the "crush
ing," despite the fact that there was
both truth and falsity in the "Goose-
Step" references to the Farm.
Yet now —10 years later—when
the prime issue in the California
gubernatorial campaign is "unem
ployment" and not alleged B.A.C.
corruption, Republican mediums
have conjured up the ghost of the
"Goose-Step" to frighten Stanford
participants in the political seance.
It is a fi)ls2 loyalty to Stanford
that would prime Stanford students |
or adherents to defend with their
votes the maligned personalities of
ten years ago. As we have suggested
before, Stanford voters should care
not whether Sinclair is a vegetarian
or has halitosis, or whether he
"Hates Cal" or "Hates Stanford."
What can he do? What will he do?
Those are the only questions.
