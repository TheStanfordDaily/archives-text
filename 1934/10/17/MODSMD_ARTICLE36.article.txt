## STRIKES AND REVOLUTION 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
IVIr. Mellinkoff's Column, "Lost:
One Good Strike," reveals typicaliy
what happens when the journalistic
mind attempts to grasp anything
impregnated with a philosophy be
yond the obvious. This is not a
personal indictment of Mellinkoff
but of the entire group to which
he apparently belongs.
"Harry Bridges," writes Mellin
koff, . . hates to face the truth.
He hates to tell his men that the
'Great Maritime Strike' has been
lost cold." Further down we find
the assertion that what has been
gained could have been gained
without the cold hours on the water
front, the "red scare," etc.
This is like saying the French
Revolution could have been ac
complished without tearing down
the Bastile, that the colonies could
have attained their independence
without Valley Forge—and so on.

Mr. Mellinkoff could rewrite his
tory to suit his personal views,
but not the facts.
The bald fact is that the strike
was a success if only because there
was a strike.
Had Bridges and the Communists
expected the strike to attain all ends
to which it set out, they would be
denying the very foundation on
which their party is built—the major
factor which separates them from
muddleheaded liberals who, afraid
to face reality, are worshippers at
the shrine of a dead school of
thought. Economic Liberalism, Mr.
Mellinkoff and others of his ilk are
pledged to a hopeless, forlorn, and
futile crusade.
