THE THEATER IN NEW YORK
11. The Season Moves Forward
(Reviewer's Note; This is the
second of James Sandoe's articles
on the current New York Theater.)
Since I last reported, a number of
important plays have opened; un
fortunately I have only seen a few
of them and am, at this date, unable
to comment on either Merrily We
Roll Along, a bitter comedy by
George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart,
or Divided by Three, a drama by
Mrs. Kaufman and Margaret Leech, |
both of which seerri set for extensive !
runs.
Best of the plays that I have i
seen, however, is John Van Dru- j
ten's The DislaiT Side, a tender
and moving group portrait of the
women of a family. Quiet, placid,
it is once or twice marred by at- j
tempts to inject unneeded /est by
gag-lines; l>ut as played by Sybil
Thorndikc and excellent support
ing cast it is given as much justice
as even an author could desire.
Sailor Beware suffers somewhat ,
from a second rate company which
has replaced the original (now scat- i
tered about Hollywood), but has,
entered its second year with vigor
and promise to run on indefinitely.
The fiery Stevedore has re-opened
at the Civic Repertory Theater un
der Theater Union auspices. It is a j
fervently conceived but badly-writ
ten play. If the authors had been j
less eager to shout about injustices
and had constructed their play less
melodramatically, their thesis might
have been more forcefully and con
vincingly evident. As it is, the one
obviously "artistic" note is an injec
tion of spirituals between two cli
mactic scenes which serve only to
slow down the action.
The Negro cast is eager to impress ;
the play's thesis upon the audience |
but employs lungs rather than acting i
for that purpose. As a result, the 1
noise is dreadful and the rafters of
the old theater shake dangerously

over the din. The audience is tired.
Nevertheless, even if one is in
different to the message of the play,
it must be confessed that it, contains
a few tense moments among the
more rhetorical ones.
