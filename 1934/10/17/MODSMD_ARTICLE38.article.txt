FOR FUTURE

Tournaments and much testing
and trying-out mark the days before j
the Triangular Sports Day. Class
teams are being organized, as the
scoring will be done on
the basis of class and not school
supremacy. Two appearances a week
is the requirement for turning out 1
for competition.
Unusual turnouts in all the sports'
should provide plenty of material to j
choose from. In hockey there are
more experienced players than there i
were among last year's new women. :
And 3(5 out for fencing is a record.
TODAY
AFTER .5
Questions uppermost in the minds j
of women laqueteers old and .new !
now is: Who will be chosen to fill j
the ranks of the Tennis club?
An unusual display of tennis abil- i
ity will be (ho spectator's privilege
to see this afternoon after 3 o'clock. |
That is the time, when tennis club- j
bers will play with tryoutees for de- |
termination of new members.
The proposition looks good for the
club. Three freshmen have been j
heard of and there are usually some j
good ones who have not yet been
discovered. I
ALREADY
KNOWN
Priscilla Merwin won the Junior
Women's National Doubles this I
year with May Doeg of Santa Mo- J
nica. Merwin is the third doubles |
champion to come to Stanford. Helen j
Fulton, who took her freshman year
here, teamed up with Elizabeth
Kesting, now our ranking player, to
take the top place three years ago.
Kathryn Kennedy from Castil
leja is not a stranger to Stanford
courts, having completed several i
times in tournaments between the j
two schools. Great expectations also j
extend to Jean McDougall, little]
sister of Scot tie McDougall, Stan- j
ford graduate and outstanding ath- |
lete.
DISTINCTION
IN GOLF
We have other celebrities in our j
midst in other sports. Take golf, I
for instance; winner of Oregon's!
Junior Women's Championship this j
summer is June Bryant, now Stan- j
ford freshman.
Soon we will have Bryant's official i
score made on the Stanford course.
Women golfers who turn in a score j
by Sunday will be matched for tour- ;
nament play beginning next week.
Among last year's golfers who will
offer real competition again this
year are Joan MacGowan, winner
of Stanford's first women's golf j
tournament last spring; Dorothy Ly
man, Mary Louise Riley, Betty Hins- j
dale, and Jean Hobbs.
IN THE
FINISH
Although new to Stanford, consid- j
erably more will undoubtedly be '
heard about Cynthia Coonley for her i
diving and crawl stroke, and also of j
Sally Parker and Mary Ellen 1
Schmidt, free stylists.

to see this afternoon after 3 o'clock. |
That is the time, when tennis club- j
bers will play with tryoutees for de- |
termination of new members.
The proposition looks good for the
club. Three freshmen have been j
heard of and there are usually some j
good ones who have not yet been
discovered. I
ALREADY
KNOWN
Priscilla Merwin won the Junior
Women's National Doubles this I
year with May Doeg of Santa Mo- J
nica. Merwin is the third doubles |
champion to come to Stanford. Helen j
Fulton, who took her freshman year
here, teamed up with Elizabeth
Kesting, now our ranking player, to
take the top place three years ago.
Kathryn Kennedy from Castil
leja is not a stranger to Stanford
courts, having completed several i
times in tournaments between the j
two schools. Great expectations also j
extend to Jean McDougall, little]
sister of Scot tie McDougall, Stan- j
ford graduate and outstanding ath- |
lete.
DISTINCTION
IN GOLF
We have other celebrities in our j
midst in other sports. Take golf, I
for instance; winner of Oregon's!
Junior Women's Championship this j
summer is June Bryant, now Stan- j
ford freshman.
Soon we will have Bryant's official i
score made on the Stanford course.
Women golfers who turn in a score j
by Sunday will be matched for tour- ;
nament play beginning next week.
Among last year's golfers who will
offer real competition again this
year are Joan MacGowan, winner
of Stanford's first women's golf j
tournament last spring; Dorothy Ly
man, Mary Louise Riley, Betty Hins- j
dale, and Jean Hobbs.
IN THE
FINISH
Although new to Stanford, consid- j
erably more will undoubtedly be '
heard about Cynthia Coonley for her i
diving and crawl stroke, and also of j
Sally Parker and Mary Ellen 1
Schmidt, free stylists.
FOR FUTURE
REFERENCE
Tournaments and much testing
and trying-out mark the days before j
the Triangular Sports Day. Class
teams are being organized, as the
scoring will be done on
the basis of class and not school
supremacy. Two appearances a week
is the requirement for turning out 1
for competition.
Unusual turnouts in all the sports'
should provide plenty of material to j
choose from. In hockey there are
more experienced players than there i
were among last year's new women. :
And 3(5 out for fencing is a record.
TODAY
AFTER .5
Questions uppermost in the minds j
of women laqueteers old and .new !
now is: Who will be chosen to fill j
the ranks of the Tennis club?
An unusual display of tennis abil- i
ity will be (ho spectator's privilege
to see this afternoon after 3 o'clock. |
