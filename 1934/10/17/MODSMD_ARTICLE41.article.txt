# Soccer Series Opens With J.C. Tilt
## NAME TWO SQUADS FOR GAME AGAINST SAN MATEO TODAY Claim Opponents Strongest Team in League 
### John McClelland 
Stanford varsity soccer officially
"climbs on the wagon" this after
noon, with the San Mateo Junior
College tilt in the Cardinals' first
conference game of the .season at 4
o'clock on the local field.
' Probably the strongest team in
the league" is the way San Mateo
has been described by higher-ups in
soccer circles this year, and Ma
loney's men, who have only been
turning out for two weeks, fully ex
pect more than a tough battle in
this afternoon's opener. And to make
things still more formidable, the
varsity will have S.F.U. on their
hands next Saturday morning in the
second confei'ence game.
Players Given Rest
No practice was held yesterday
afternoon to allow the squad a rest
and a chance to recover from the
many minor injuries which have
plagued the team this year.
Yosterday Coach Harry Maloney
announced his A and B squads for
the coming season. The selections
were made on the basis of showings
made in practice during the last two
weeks and in the two practice games
that have been played. Changes, of
course, are likely to be made during
the season, but the eleven men who
will start tomorrow now constitute
the regular A team.
At outside left is Hanson, a short,
stocky player who is developing an
accurate kick in the scoring area.
Next to him at inside left is Row, a
sophomore with no intercollegiate
experience but possessing much tal
ent in pounding the goal. At center
forward, where the now injured A1
Navarro was destined to play, is
Sawyer, a newcomer to Stanford
soccer who has shown up remarkably
well in practice.
Walker at Key Post
On the right flank is Pete Knecht,
brother of Captain Carl of last year's
varsity, who apparently has inher
ited much of big brother's talent. At
inside right will be Dibble, another
inexperienced man who is rather
wild on passing but unusually fast
in dribbling.
In the key post at. center half will
be Walker, a heady player who rivals
in speed Captain Waddy White, who
will play left half. At right half is
Bob Hall, sophomore who starred on
last year's frosh team.
Name Back Defense
Three more sophomores make up
the back line defense: Dick Bullis
and Steve Enke will play in the full
back positions presenting a defense
wall that shows promise of equaling
the combination of Johnson-Strou
sek, last year's back men, and John
McClelland will defend the goal.
Team B, composed of Wilson, Peck,
Vierling, Eitner, Cotter, Johnstone,
Halaby, Myers, Colley, Kinney,
and Nightingale, will be on hand and
it is likely, Maloney will use many
of them as substitutes tomorrow.

accurate kick in the scoring area.
Next to him at inside left is Row, a
sophomore with no intercollegiate
experience but possessing much tal
ent in pounding the goal. At center
forward, where the now injured A1
Navarro was destined to play, is
Sawyer, a newcomer to Stanford
soccer who has shown up remarkably
well in practice.
Walker at Key Post
On the right flank is Pete Knecht,
brother of Captain Carl of last year's
varsity, who apparently has inher
ited much of big brother's talent. At
inside right will be Dibble, another
inexperienced man who is rather
wild on passing but unusually fast
in dribbling.
In the key post at. center half will
be Walker, a heady player who rivals
in speed Captain Waddy White, who
will play left half. At right half is
Bob Hall, sophomore who starred on
last year's frosh team.
Name Back Defense
Three more sophomores make up
the back line defense: Dick Bullis
and Steve Enke will play in the full
back positions presenting a defense
wall that shows promise of equaling
the combination of Johnson-Strou
sek, last year's back men, and John
McClelland will defend the goal.
Team B, composed of Wilson, Peck,
Vierling, Eitner, Cotter, Johnstone,
Halaby, Myers, Colley, Kinney,
and Nightingale, will be on hand and
it is likely, Maloney will use many
of them as substitutes tomorrow.
Stanford varsity soccer officially
"climbs on the wagon" this after
noon, with the San Mateo Junior
College tilt in the Cardinals' first
conference game of the .season at 4
o'clock on the local field.
' Probably the strongest team in
the league" is the way San Mateo
has been described by higher-ups in
soccer circles this year, and Ma
loney's men, who have only been
turning out for two weeks, fully ex
pect more than a tough battle in
this afternoon's opener. And to make
things still more formidable, the
varsity will have S.F.U. on their
hands next Saturday morning in the
second confei'ence game.
Players Given Rest
No practice was held yesterday
afternoon to allow the squad a rest
and a chance to recover from the
many minor injuries which have
plagued the team this year.
Yosterday Coach Harry Maloney
announced his A and B squads for
the coming season. The selections
were made on the basis of showings
made in practice during the last two
weeks and in the two practice games
that have been played. Changes, of
course, are likely to be made during
the season, but the eleven men who
will start tomorrow now constitute
the regular A team.
At outside left is Hanson, a short,
stocky player who is developing an
accurate kick in the scoring area.
Next to him at inside left is Row, a
sophomore with no intercollegiate
experience but possessing much tal
ent in pounding the goal. At center
forward, where the now injured A1
Navarro was destined to play, is
Sawyer, a newcomer to Stanford
