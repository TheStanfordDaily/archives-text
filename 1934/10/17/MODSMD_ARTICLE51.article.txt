# FROSH PLAN FOR SAN MATEO TILT
## 
### 
San Mateo, J.C., conference-win
ning football machine, will play host
to the Stanford Frosh Saturday after
noon in one of the toughest games
on the Babe schedule. The jaysee
outfit has been Northern California
J.C. champions for the past two
years, and always puts a good team
on the field.
Frosh Coach Jim Bradshaw is
taking no chance of a slip-up and
subsequent defeat Saturday, and
is working his men in all depart
ments. He is especially stressing a
passing game. The frosh, in their
previous games, have gone places
with passes.
Most of the tossing is done by (he
fullbacks, Bill Paulman and Ham
Hamilton. Bob Dakan and Berneth
Layer, ends, and Jimmy Coffis and
Tom Collins, backs, made some pret
ty circus catches in Monday's work
out, and all know what to do when
they get the ball.
Paulman's kicking was a high
light in the San Jose State frosh
game last Saturday. He lofted sev
eral spirals over 50 yards from the
line of scrimmage, and crossed up
the safety man on one occasion with
a quick-kick that easily cleared his
head.
Babe linemen worked together
well on defense Saturday, often pil
ing up the interference before it
c:ould get started beyond the line of
scrimmage.
