# INDIAN, LAKESIDE WATER POLO MEN VIE HERE TONIGHT
## Thornton's Men Strive For 15th Straight Victory 
### 
There may be more than the ex
pected hard workout in store for
Nort Thornton's varsity water polo
outfit when the Cards tangle with
the Lakeside Swimming Club of
Oakland in Encina pools at 8 o'clock
tonight.
The transbay team lost its three
opening games to California and the
Olympic Club, but showed improve
ment with each start and, with
Gordon Corson its star forward, may
give Stanford trouble. If the visitors
provide stiff enough competition,
they will disrupt Thornton's plan of
substituting an entire team.
Jaysee Game
Since these reserves are pushing
the regulars hard for starting posi
tions, the Indian coach will carry two
full teams as the varsity squad, with
the remaining 14 players composing
the junior varsity. A "jaysee" game
will be played between Stanford and
Lakeside shortly after the end of the
main event.
Never having lost a league game
in their two years of play since the
Northern California Water Polo
League was formed, the Cardinals
will be striving for their fifteenth
straight win tonight. If their minds
are not too occupied with thoughts
of the quest for number 16 against
U.C.L.A. Friday afternoon, they
should take the measure of Lake
side as expected.
Card Line-Up
Stanford's probable starting line
up is as follows:
Sprint, Vlad Taranik; forwards,
Captain Leo Cook and Bob Foster;
center back, Wally Wiget; guards,
Bill Woodard and Jim Benet; goal
guard, Bob Haslacher.
