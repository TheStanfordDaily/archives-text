# '38 Jolly-up Novel in Plan
## 
### 
"To be or not to be," the problem
confronting the jolly-up tradition at
Stanford, will be tested tonight from
7 to 8 o'clock in the Women's gym
by the first freshman jolly-up.
A special plan has been worked
out by Chairman Mary Livingstone
and a men's committee, which will
enable all roughs to attend and yet
will insure a quick exchange of
partners throughout the evening.
Unless all roughs follow the lead
ership, of the men's committee who
have endorsed the plan, the jolly-up
will be forced to follow the way of
several other Stanford traditions, and
fade into the system of strictly in
vitational "7 to B's," said Miss Liv
ingstone.
The committee of _ well-known
"jolly-uppers" are: Jimmy Triolo,
Marvie Kahn, Johnny Mottram,
Ralph Stavcr, Bill Waltman, Bob
Church, Julius Jacobs, Bob Jones,
Bones Hamilton, Sterling Cottrell,
Bill Drew, Dick Stark, John Atkin
son, Ted Geisler, Don Moulton, Ben
Dey, John Huston, and T. M. Mc-
Daniels.
