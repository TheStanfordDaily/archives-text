School has been going 12 days now—long enough for you to discover that you can
not cover life at the Farm without a car. In the first place, you can't even get to classes,
much less to the city. Much less to the transbay football games, or to weekends in Carmel.
Ansel J. Schloss has made a concentrated plan of meeting Stanford's student car
problem. Cars of roadster, convertible and coupe types have been chosen and put
through rigid eligibility tests. I
These are picked cars—picked on strong standards to warrant our use of them in
this particularly insistent market of 37-mile-away Stanford campus. Smooth, trim, and
smart in appearance, all of very recent model, mechanically perfect—they are, to top
off our intention, specially suited to the collegiate purse.
Whether you're working your way through Stanford—or whether you are keeping
within an allowance from the family—in either case the price and payments on our
special Stanford cars will be neatly proportioned to your funds.
You have to have a car—that's obvious. So simply come up and pick it out.

School has been going 12 days now—long enough for you to discover that you can
not cover life at the Farm without a car. In the first place, you can't even get to classes,
much less to the city. Much less to the transbay football games, or to weekends in Carmel.
Ansel J. Schloss has made a concentrated plan of meeting Stanford's student car
problem. Cars of roadster, convertible and coupe types have been chosen and put
through rigid eligibility tests. I
These are picked cars—picked on strong standards to warrant our use of them in
this particularly insistent market of 37-mile-away Stanford campus. Smooth, trim, and
smart in appearance, all of very recent model, mechanically perfect—they are, to top
off our intention, specially suited to the collegiate purse.
