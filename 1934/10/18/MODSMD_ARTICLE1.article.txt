## No Fatalities Attributed To Southern California Disturbance SCHOOLS SHUT DOWN Tremor Awakens Residents Of Long Beach 
### 
LOS ANGEIES, Oct. 17 (/I 1 ). â€”
Earthquake and heavy rainfall vis
ited Southern California today.
Many streets of Los Angeles and
surrounding cities were flooded,
schools were shut down for the day
at Long Beach, sand was washed
into the streets of Manhattan Beach,
but no loss of life was attributed di
rectly either to the storm or earth
quake.
At San Pedro, the marine ex
change reported the appearance of a
water spout just before noon about
two miles off the harbor breakwater
lighthouse. The thin column of
spray, corresponding to a whirlwind
raising dust l'rom the surface of the
earth, moved southeastward and dis
appeared offshore below Long
Beach.
Early Morning Quake
Long Beach, where several score
lost their lives during the quake of
March 10, 1933, was severely shaken
again at 1:45 a.m. today.
Virtually the entire city was
awakened by the shock, which
lasted only two seconds, and many
citizens dashed into rain-lashed
streets in their night clothes, but
soon returned to their beds when
no repetition of the shock occur
red.
The quake also was felt at various
communities south and west of Los
Angeles, including Huntington
Park, Lynwood, San Pedro, Ingle
wood, Redondo, El Segundo ana
Venice, where several windows were
cracked.
Tent Schools Soaked
The combination of rainfall and
earthquake resulted in temporary
suspension of classcs in Long Beach.
Virtually every school building in
the beach metropolis was damaged
by the shock a year and a half ago.
Temporary tent bungalows replaced
the school buildings, and the heavy
rain made most of these unfit for
occupation today.
Flooded streets and playgrounds
also prevented many children from
reaching their schools, and slippery
pavements throughout the area
causcd numerous traffic accidents.
Kainfall in Los Angeles county
ranged all the way from a few
hundredths of an inch to four
inches that poured out of the
skies in a cloudburst centering in
the area comprsing Bell Rower,
Downey and Norwalk.
Snow fell along the San Gabriel
mountains and in Big Pines Park,
with three inches on Mount Islip.
Tail of Blizzard
The Weather Bureau said this
snow raged in on the, tail end of a
blizzard encompassing the area from
the High Sierra to Los Angeles
county.
A 65 miles an hour wind
whipped westward over the moun
tains between here and Santa
Barbara.
The waterspout whirled down to
Long Beach and dissolved as it
neared the shoreline. At San Pedro
there was a 25-, mile wind that
caused storm warnings to be hoisted
for small craft. Airplane flights to
Santa Calalina island were can
celled.

their ideal girl must not be a gold
digger, gossiper, pouter, nor be de
ceitful.
