# PARTY FEATURES VARIED PROGRAM
## Games Sponsored by Three Upper Classes 
### 
Besides the dancing customarily
associated with Women's Confer
ence Parties, this year's affair claims
the addition of many and varied
games, which will supplement the
skits, songs, and other activities al
ready planned.
Each class except the freshman
supervises some part of the enter
tainment. The sophomores plan to
erect four or five ping-pong tables
in the patio, with four paddles per
table, so that a continuous series of
doubles tournaments will go on dur
ing the entire evening.
According to Helen Warson, in
charge of arrangements for the sec
ond classmen, the tables will be fully
lighted, and all ihose not desiring
to dance may take their turn at the
table tennis competitions.
Basketball games, of a novel char
acter not yet revealed, but guaran
teed to be "original and interesting,"
are to be presented by a committee
working under Babe Dear.
The seniors will sponsor a double
header consisting of badminton and
shuffle-board. Ann Van Wagenen
and the group assisting her an
nounce that hostesses will be on
hand throughout the evening to
explain rules to all those attempting
them for the first time, but prom
ise that "They're not really hard at
all. Just try them!"
Loudspeakers will be installed in
the patio as well as both sides of
the gym, so that competitors as
dancers may hear the tuneful strains
of Gordon Heche's five-piece or
chestra.
Dancing and games will continue
throughout the evening, from 7 to
9 o'clock, except during presenta
tion of skits.
Costumes are to be worn both
