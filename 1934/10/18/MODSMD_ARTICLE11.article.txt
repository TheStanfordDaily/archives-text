# Play Contest Ends Saturday
## 
### 
i All original manuscripts to be
submitted for the Masquers reading
I scheduled for November 7 must be
! in room 203 on or before Saturday,
j October 20.
i The reading will consist of either
; three one-act plays or one three-act
play. On the board of selection will
|be Miss Buckingham, Dr. Bailey,
land two as yet unidentified mem
bers.
It is the general opinion of the
I English faculty that this project of
Masquers, Stanford women's hon
i orary dramatic society, will encour
age dramatic writing by the stu
dents. It is the first time in Stanford
history that dramatic writing in gen
eral has been fostered. Competition
has been held in the lyrical sphere
of drama for the operettas; but this
! is the first time that Stanford stu
dents have vied in the creation of
-the straight play.
j For this reason, Masquers has won
the whole-hearted support of both
the English Club and Sword and
Sandals, organizations that were
formerly opposed.
