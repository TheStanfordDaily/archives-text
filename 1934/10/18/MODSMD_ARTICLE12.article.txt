# Masquers to Select Play
## 
### 
From original manuscripts sub
mitted not later than Friday, a fac
ulty committee of four will select
either three one-act plays or one
three-act production to be presented
by Masquers on November 7.
Competition is open to all students,
it was pointed out last night by Jean
Albertson, president of the women's
dramatic organization. The plays
that are not chosen for this quarter's
reading will be held over for later
competition, since the Masquers plan
to present one program every quar
ter.
The faculty judges include Dr.
Marjory Bailey, Miss Buckingham,
Mrs. Sherwood Anderson, and Dr.
Albert Guerard, Miss Albertson said.
Manuscripts may be submitted to
room 203 in the English Building.
