# Little Difference Shown In Women's Living Rules
## 
### 
The; houses on the Row are re
putedly more lenient than the va
rious women's living groups on ancl
oil campus in the matter of lockout
regulations. For this reason one of
the strong motives for joining so
rorities has been, in many cases,
the desire to escape (he eagle-eyed
duennas who oversee Roble, La
gunita, et al. Now is the time for
debunking this outworn tradition.
Herein lies a tale.
First is the matter of penalties. A
row girl who in any way breaks
regulations must come before the
executive committee of her own
house for punishment, as ordered by
the executive council of women's
student government. The penalties
given are not reported, but the
lockout slips are; therefore, il be
hooves the houses to clamp down
enough to discourage frequent viola
tions.
Then, too, the honor system it. in
force here, and the executive com
mittee is in honor bound to fol
low the advice of student govern
ment as to strictness of penalties.
For the sake of order in the houses
themselves it is necessary to keep
regulations respected, therefore, the
row girl is up against stiff discipline
and has little if any chance to evade
her just deserts.
The key system is employed by
all but one house on the Row, and

the trials and tribulations of this
system are many. Each girl is given !
a numbered key, to have and to!
hold, or suffer dire consequences to
the pocketbook. If any key is lost, i
the offending girl in all but two of !
these houses must pay to have the I
lock changed and an entire set of
new keys made to avoid the pos
sibility of the lost key being used
to aid theft. jrhis operation of chang
ing the keys costs anywhere from'
$3 to â– jlO. depending on the amount
of change necessary.
It a key is forgotten a technical
lockout is called, and three tech
nicals call for a penalty. The pro- j
cedure of getting into a house with- >
out a key varies. Kappas and Thetas
must wait for the next girl home to >
let them in. cold though it may be |
on the front porch. The other!
houses allow the offender to ring
th:' bell to awaken either the house j
mother or whoever first hears the!
bell . Since no one enjoys aking
in the middle of the night, this is a
distnietly embarrassing thing to do,
and is no atd in getting off without
a penalty.
The Pi Phis have no keys, but
must ring the bell and be admitted
by the house mother, which is prac
tically the same system as used in
Roble.
All in all, lockouts are no fun any
where on the campus.
