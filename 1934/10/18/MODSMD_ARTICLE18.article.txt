# P.A. System To Be Used In Assembly
## Student Heads To Speak On Various Activities 
### 
In today's 11 o'clock all-Univer
sity assembly, the battle against the
poor acoustics of the Assembly hall,
waged by speakers through long
years, linally will be won. The
A.S.S.U. loud speaker system has
been installed in the hall and will
be used to project the voices of the
several student speakers on the
program.
The meeting this morning is pri
'marily for the benefit of freshmen
and new students, to acquaint them
with the various activities of the
University and the persons con
nected with them. Eleven o'clock
classes will be dismissed.

as announced by A.S.S.U. President
Marvie Kahn is as follows:
Marion Storey, president of the
Women's Conference, speaking on
Stanford's first president, David
Starr Jordan; Ben Cave, student
manager, pointing out the general
system of finance of the A.S.S.U.;
Norman Barnes, music manager,
speaking on musical activities, will
introduce the Stanford Glee Club.
The glee club will sing two num
bers, followed by Helen Ray, vice
president of the A.S.S.U., speaking
on the customs of the University;
and by Gordon Steedman, editor of
the Chaparral, on publications.
In the next interval the Stanford
band will play several selections, fol
lowed by the introduction of the
