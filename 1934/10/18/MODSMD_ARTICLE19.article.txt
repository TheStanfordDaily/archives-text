# Frosh Danee Draws Crowd
## 
### 
Despite the drizzling rain, the first
jolly-up of this year's freshman
class drew a good-sized crowd to
the Roble gym last night to dance
to the syncopated strains of A1
Rushton's "Royal Cardinals." The
new $700 public address system,
bought by the A.S.S.U. lust spring
and recently scored as unsatisfac
tory, again gave but a mediocre
performance.
Although the best available ampli
fiers were obtained when the new
system was purchasd, the fault
seems to lie in an inferior micro
phone. An attempt was made last
evening to improve the tone through
certain changes in the electric cir
cuit of the microphone. This modifi
cation improved the transmission of
the music but not of the speaking
voice.
Jim Sharpe, instructor in the ra
dio engineering laboratory, whom
the Daily erroneously credited with
constructing the apparatus (it was
built while he was on a leave of
absence), stated that the chief diffi
culty the engineers encountered
during the construction was making
a system equally suitable to indoor
and outdoor transmission. The sysr
tem has been found to work suc
cessfully out-of-doors, but as yet
has not been satisfactory indoors.
