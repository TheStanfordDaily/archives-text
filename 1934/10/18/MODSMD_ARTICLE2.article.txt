# Two Days Only Remain to Buy S. C. Game Cards
## 
### 
Tickets for next week's tilt against
U.S.C. have been on sale for two
days, and with only today and to
morrow remaining, it appears as if
the number of rooters who will be
on the inside of the stadium at kick
off time will look more like the As
sembly Hall crowd for a Tuesday
evening lecture rather than the Card
rooting section of the last ten years.
Alfred Masters, BA.C. graduate
manager, reports that the general
ticket sale for the Trojan game is
very promising. On the other hand,
rooters from Stanford, for whom the
game is primarily intended, have
only bought a total of 512 tickets,
337 men and 175 women. After Fri
day at 5 o'clock the student ticket
sale will be permanently stopped,
say B.A.C. officials, and those with
out ducats are out in the cold.
Seats are still obtainable today and
tomorrow at the Board of Athletic
Control ticket booth, for $1.10. Mon
day any tickets remaining go on
sale as regular seats for any non
students interested in sitting above
the rooting section.
