# Campaign Mapped For Construction of Memorial Theater
## Ex Committee, President Wilbur, Roth Plan Prospect 
### Annalce Whitmore 
A Stanford School of the Theater,
rivalling that of Yale—
That was the prospect outlined at
yesterday's Executive Committee
session with President Ray Lyman
Wilbur and Comptroller Almon E.
Roth.
The discussion assured one thing.
Specifications for the long-needed
and much-agitated campus theater,
viewed for the first time, far sur
pass expectations of student repre
sentatives.
Group Imposing
The dramatic school would be only
a unit in an impressive Memorial
group. A technically perfect, aes
thetically excellent theater, capacity
1000; arcade-surrounded Memorial
Court; rehearsal rooms; storage
space; offices; library; costume room;
and imposing tower, including a
stage block which would be better
than anything on 'the coast, except,
the Memorial Opera House, arc
highlights of architects' proposals.
Inclusion of the court serves a
practical as well as an aesthetic pur
pose, since it makes available the
Stanford War Memorial Fund, now
totalling $162,555.25.
Total estimated cost of the project,
with air-conditioning unit and sev
eral other desirable features, reaches
$524,300. The Stanford Theater
FThW, amassed during recent years
by a campus committee, Chaparral,
and the Stanford Daily, totals
$4,761.71.
Sum Insufficient
This leaves a sum of $356,983.04,
computes Roth, still to be collccted.
Students last year voted to assess
themselves an additional dollar per
quarter, to be applied toward con
struction of the theater. The extra
dollar fee was not levied until final
decision as to size and cost of the
structure had been made.
Those dollars, however, total a
mere $10,000 per year, an amount
barely sufficient to pay interest on
the sum necessary for construction.
Union Dollar Available
Roth voiced the unofficial hope
that the fee which goes at present
for maintenance of the Union group
might be available, since Union is
now virtually self - supporting.
B.A.C. funds may be forthcoming,
as the athletic board has, in past
years, erected the Women's gym
nasium as well as Branner hall.
Private aid is entirely possible,
think Wilbur, Roth, and the execu
tive committee. No definite plan has
been offered as yet, but public in
terest in the project is known to be
high.
May Change Size
A.S.S.U. President Marvie Kahn
was of the opinion that 1000 seating
capacity was not sufficient. Campus
crowds, thinks Kahn, usually total
2500. He suggests that the theater be
expanded to accommodate 1200, so
that performances, if repeated on
successive evenings, could be at
tended by all prospective theater
goers.
Harold Helvenston, drama head
now on sabbatical leave, enthusias
tically backs the two-pcrformancc
idea. "Vastly superior in almost
every respect," he recommends.
The impossibility of building a
single structure which would accom
modate the 2500 Concert Series
crowd, and remain an acoustically
perfect theater, was stressed by Wil
bur and Roth. Unanimous conclu
sion was that the smaller theater
proper filled the greater need.
Architects' plans for the group,
with a full description of technical
features, will appear in tomorrow's
Daily, with final financial arrange
ments to be completed in the near
future.

1000; arcade-surrounded Memorial
Court; rehearsal rooms; storage
space; offices; library; costume room;
and imposing tower, including a
stage block which would be better
than anything on 'the coast, except,
the Memorial Opera House, arc
highlights of architects' proposals.
Inclusion of the court serves a
practical as well as an aesthetic pur
pose, since it makes available the
Stanford War Memorial Fund, now
totalling $162,555.25.
Total estimated cost of the project,
with air-conditioning unit and sev
eral other desirable features, reaches
$524,300. The Stanford Theater
FThW, amassed during recent years
by a campus committee, Chaparral,
and the Stanford Daily, totals
$4,761.71.
Sum Insufficient
This leaves a sum of $356,983.04,
computes Roth, still to be collccted.
Students last year voted to assess
themselves an additional dollar per
quarter, to be applied toward con
struction of the theater. The extra
dollar fee was not levied until final
decision as to size and cost of the
structure had been made.
Those dollars, however, total a
mere $10,000 per year, an amount
barely sufficient to pay interest on
the sum necessary for construction.
Union Dollar Available
Roth voiced the unofficial hope
that the fee which goes at present
for maintenance of the Union group
might be available, since Union is
now virtually self - supporting.
B.A.C. funds may be forthcoming,
as the athletic board has, in past
years, erected the Women's gym
nasium as well as Branner hall.
Private aid is entirely possible,
think Wilbur, Roth, and the execu
tive committee. No definite plan has
been offered as yet, but public in
terest in the project is known to be
high.
May Change Size
A.S.S.U. President Marvie Kahn
was of the opinion that 1000 seating
capacity was not sufficient. Campus
crowds, thinks Kahn, usually total
2500. He suggests that the theater be
expanded to accommodate 1200, so
that performances, if repeated on
successive evenings, could be at
tended by all prospective theater
goers.
Harold Helvenston, drama head
now on sabbatical leave, enthusias
tically backs the two-pcrformancc
idea. "Vastly superior in almost
every respect," he recommends.
The impossibility of building a
single structure which would accom
modate the 2500 Concert Series
crowd, and remain an acoustically
perfect theater, was stressed by Wil
bur and Roth. Unanimous conclu
sion was that the smaller theater
proper filled the greater need.
Architects' plans for the group,
with a full description of technical
features, will appear in tomorrow's
Daily, with final financial arrange
ments to be completed in the near
future.
A Stanford School of the Theater,
rivalling that of Yale—
That was the prospect outlined at
yesterday's Executive Committee
session with President Ray Lyman
Wilbur and Comptroller Almon E.
Roth.
The discussion assured one thing.
Specifications for the long-needed
and much-agitated campus theater,
viewed for the first time, far sur
pass expectations of student repre
sentatives.

a unit in an impressive Memorial
