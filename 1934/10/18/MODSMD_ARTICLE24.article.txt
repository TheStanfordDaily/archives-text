Unintentionally, the Haiti/ (Uiliforninn lias
raised ;i very interesting question. For too
|<Â»ng, the Pacific ('.oast and the lest of this
pigskin-minded America lias been bothered
with pseudo investigations, scandals, and
other circumstances that bear very close re
semblance to a three-ring circus that has tried
to outdo iiscll'.
Somebody has said that California is en
gaged in the Pleasant Pastime of Proselyting.
So that's the title of this morning's perform
ance. Of course, (lalil'ornians point out that
Southern Californians shouldn't leave the
shades up at night while the lights are on.
When a rumpus of this sort becomes an
annual event, to be heralded as front page
news by the money-mad circulation hounds
of the metropolitan newspapers, it is no longer
a matter to be dodged.
The question is simple. Everybody has
charged everybody else with "professional
ism" in some form ot devil-lake-the-hindmost
arrangement. Rather than a choice as to what
institution has remained pure and unsullied
during these terrible years, it apparently lias
become a selection of the best from among the
bad, bad colleges. Hut that need not be done
he re.
Athletes, most everywhere, have been at a
premium. What kind of a premium, specifi
cally, is not to the point. Some universities
have outdone the others in methods of ap
proach. All have sought the best men avail
able.
There must be some way out ol the mess.
A way that will leave the athlete in a much
better spot than is his today. He is working
under a subterfuge if he does receive an extra
job while he is on any man's varsity, for people
think it is "unfair" when this practice is made
public. On the other hand, the present situ
ation can't go on. It is unfair to the school
and to the individual.
The Daily raises the question today. How
is il possible to lake cove of the self-supporting
men who </ine oil their time to their particular
sport, ami ilo so in all fairness, without eastin</
ant/ slit/ma upon the individual?
Next week, an answer should be forth
coming.
