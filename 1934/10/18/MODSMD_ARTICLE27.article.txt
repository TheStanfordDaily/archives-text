# THE 						MAN BEHIND THE NAME ...

### BOB JONES 
MAYOR LaGUARDIA OF NEW YORK CITY
Busiest and most difficult person to see was Fiorello
('Little Flower") LaGuardia, the tireless mayor of
New York City, the mayor who, in less than two months
of office, had plunged into more problems than Jimmy
Walker tackled in an entire year.
Swept into office on the fusion ticket on the same
day last November that the regime of prohibition
ended, LaGuardia was busy that June afternoon I went
to visit him, digging New York out of the Tammany
debris. He was so busy that he ate lunch in his office,
working all the while.
I sat in his waiting room some two hours. That
room in the little city hall offered an interesting side
light to the mayor and his New York. Four women
had a big police sergeant at the "end of his ropes"
with their insistent demands to see the mayor himself
and not some "second-rate" secretary or ward boss or
ward president. Those four determined visitors sput
tered and insisted on seeing the burgomaster who,
they were sure, would really answer their demands. I
never did find out if they saw him.
Finally, the secretary said that I might see His
Honor, the mayor. Seated behind a paper-piled desk
and surrounded by several men, one his secretary, was
the much-talked-of LaGuardia, son of an Italian
immigrant, and whose berth was the highest yet
reached in United States politics by a man of Italian
stock. Olive-skinned, wild-haired, and chunky, the
"Little Flower,'' typically Italian looking, was a five
foot-two bundle of tremendous energy.
He smiled when I entered the room. Before I was
half-way across the room, he began talking. His greet
ing was cheerful. He wanted to know what he could
do for me.
In gaining entrance to His Honor, I gave a sa refer
ence the name of a close friend of mine who was in
Congress with "LaGuardia. The mayor Recalled those
days in the House when he, as the dynamic irregular
and menace to the two parties, sei-ved with my friend.
The mayor's political career began definitely in
1916 when he went to Congress. During the war he
left the Capital to serve as a major in the air corps.
Back from overseas he again invaded the House. In
1929 he hurled charges of graft in the New York City
government and thus started the great Seabury ex
posures of Tammany which enabled him to become
mayor.
I asked him how the newspapers could help hi.m
rebuild the city. He said that the aid those organs
could give him would be most beneficial. He asked for
a true reporting of the news from the city hall, a steady
and consistent reporting of that news, a true represen
tation of the results of city hall campaigns, and honest,
constructive criticism.
When I requested his signature, he smiled, looked at
the names of men of note who had already signed,
and then asked like a kid what I was going to do with
all the autographs. After I had explained, he added
his to the list of celebrities.

Tomorrow may I introduce the last in this
series of men of note with a glimpse of Warden
Lawes and his "boys" of Sing Sing.

room in the little city hall offered an interesting side
light to the mayor and his New York. Four women
had a big police sergeant at the "end of his ropes"
with their insistent demands to see the mayor himself
and not some "second-rate" secretary or ward boss or
ward president. Those four determined visitors sput
tered and insisted on seeing the burgomaster who,
they were sure, would really answer their demands. I
never did find out if they saw him.
Finally, the secretary said that I might see His
Honor, the mayor. Seated behind a paper-piled desk
and surrounded by several men, one his secretary, was
the much-talked-of LaGuardia, son of an Italian
immigrant, and whose berth was the highest yet
reached in United States politics by a man of Italian
stock. Olive-skinned, wild-haired, and chunky, the
"Little Flower,'' typically Italian looking, was a five
foot-two bundle of tremendous energy.
He smiled when I entered the room. Before I was
half-way across the room, he began talking. His greet
ing was cheerful. He wanted to know what he could
do for me.
In gaining entrance to His Honor, I gave a sa refer
ence the name of a close friend of mine who was in
Congress with "LaGuardia. The mayor Recalled those
days in the House when he, as the dynamic irregular
and menace to the two parties, sei-ved with my friend.
The mayor's political career began definitely in
1916 when he went to Congress. During the war he
left the Capital to serve as a major in the air corps.
Back from overseas he again invaded the House. In
1929 he hurled charges of graft in the New York City
government and thus started the great Seabury ex
posures of Tammany which enabled him to become
mayor.
I asked him how the newspapers could help hi.m
rebuild the city. He said that the aid those organs
could give him would be most beneficial. He asked for
a true reporting of the news from the city hall, a steady
and consistent reporting of that news, a true represen
tation of the results of city hall campaigns, and honest,
constructive criticism.
When I requested his signature, he smiled, looked at
the names of men of note who had already signed,
and then asked like a kid what I was going to do with
all the autographs. After I had explained, he added
his to the list of celebrities.

Tomorrow may I introduce the last in this
series of men of note with a glimpse of Warden
Lawes and his "boys" of Sing Sing.
MAYOR LaGUARDIA OF NEW YORK CITY
Busiest and most difficult person to see was Fiorello
('Little Flower") LaGuardia, the tireless mayor of
New York City, the mayor who, in less than two months
of office, had plunged into more problems than Jimmy
Walker tackled in an entire year.
Swept into office on the fusion ticket on the same
day last November that the regime of prohibition
ended, LaGuardia was busy that June afternoon I went
to visit him, digging New York out of the Tammany
debris. He was so busy that he ate lunch in his office,
working all the while.
I sat in his waiting room some two hours. That
room in the little city hall offered an interesting side
light to the mayor and his New York. Four women
had a big police sergeant at the "end of his ropes"
