# VIEWING THE NEWS
## WITH PAUL EUGENE HOLDEN 
### John McClelland 
Ever since the Blue Eagle commenced its reign
over United States industry, and especially during the
last twelve months, labor and employers have been at
each other's throats, wrangling over hours and wages,
rebelling in strikes and lockouts, and creating such a
continual furore in the world of manufacturing and
commerce as has never been seen in this country.
This situation, created largely by Section 7-A of
the N.R.A. employment code, is due for an immediate
end, in the opinion of Professor Eugene Holden of
the Graduate School of Business.
Professor Holden teaches courses in industrial man
agement, and the problems of labor and employers is
one of the subjects in which he is most vitally con
cerned.
Viewing first the most violent labor-employer con
flict in the current news—the Hungary miners suicide
strike—Professor Holden said:
"The Hungarian episode is the most extreme
example of a strike I have ever seen; but such a
thing could certainly never happen in this coun
try. Managements in the United States are more
amenable to the demands of the workers. The
philosophy of American labor is not one of des
peration as it appears to be in Hungary. And
public opinion would never permit such a thing."
Then, turning to the recent meeting of the A. F. of
L. in San Francisco, the professor expressed the view
that the meet was decidedly a dud.
The A. F. of L. is coming to realize that they must
change the old basis of organization and representation
if they wish to meet present-day demands. The San
Francisco meeting showed this. In years past the
numerous small crafts unions were suitable for the
purposes of the Federation. But no more. The vertical
type of organization, or industrial union, is coming to
be the only practical method of labor organization.
Professor Holden explains the reasons for this
inevitable change simply. When there are many small
crafts unions in an industry, usually 90 per cent of
the workers are without representation since their
work is not of a character meriting membership in
one of the unions. But when all the workers belong
to a single, large unit such as automotive workers,
typographical workers, or pulp and paper workers,
then 100 per cent representation is assured.
Viewing the recent longshoremen's strike here on
the coast, Professor Holden expressed the opinion that
it was "a striking example of the futility of strikes."
When one looks at the results which the mediation
board finally arrived at, it is easy to see that the same
things could have been done in two weeks time after
the strike broke out. As it is, there is nothing that can
compensate for all the tremendous losses which
mounted up during the long three-months walkout.
The same thing applies to the recent textile strike.
It, too, was futile and resultless. Intelligent arbitra
tion, in this case, could have settled matters within two
hours.
"I have never yet heard of a strike taking place in
a plant where there was a good works council," lie
said. American labor is rapidly beginning to share
Holden's views, it seems, since at present four million
(considerably more than belong to the A. F. of L.)
workers deal with their employers through works
councils.
A works council is a union within a company where
the workers and the management meet together and
discuss and arbitrate on problems that pertain to that
specific plant and not to those concerned with the same
type of industry on the other side of the continent, for
example. The works council idea, however, requires
an enlightened attitude on the part of both sides which
will take some time to build up universally.
The upshot of Professor Holden's views, briefly,
amounts to this: Labor will eventually swing entirely
to the vertical type of organization. Disputes will be
settled immediately in the plants themselves and not
allowed to fester and drag out as in the longshore
and textile strikes. The merits of arbitration will be
recognized. And labor disputes will decrease.
