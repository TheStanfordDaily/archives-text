# BULL SESSION
## CHALLENGE TO LIBERTY: LOCAL VINTAGE 
### 
i Many things are justified under
(he label of "emergency." Thu.s fire
men may enter boudoirs, fat men
j go in swimming, and babies swallow
castor oil. But if the sanctity of the
i boudoir Ls always violated; if fat |
men always run around in bathing
i suits; and babies are given castor oil
i ai; a regular article of diet—then it
|is time to complain. Unusual and
I unnecessary measures in normal
i times should not be permissible.

Now Stanford has an Ex Commit- '
j tee, which is apparently a good Ex !
| Committee. And Stanford has had
j other Ex Committees; and will have
I more. And judging from past Ex
j Committees, one cannot bank on the
1 future. Queer things have hap-'
) pened, and will happen. Last j
Spring when the Constitution and
! student government in general were |
, given a thorough overhauling, it
I was decided to guard against the
i queer ideas, queer notions of power,
! and queers as a class which often
j gain entrance to the sacrosanct
i council chamber of the Ex Com
| mittee.
i
Stanford's constitutional fathers
! decided to give to the Dramatic
j Council and the Activities Council
[ a certain degree of freedom: their
minutes stood without the sanction
[of the Ex Committee. True, if the :
! Ex Committee felt that the two sub- j
; councils had gone completely wild
iit could revoke charters and run I
■ through a financial squeeze-play
jon their operations. But the min
utes were sacred. The virginity of j
| the Councils' minutes has been at- j
i tacked in committee . And it should
i be opposed, if the Ex Committee is
j to keep its place as a gentle steering
i committee and not a dictatorial
| body.
The Ex Committee also proposes'
to have lodged in it the power to fill
i all vacancies except a presidential
i one—not just temporarily, but until I
I the next general student body elec
| tions. But though the present Ex
Committee's motives may be noble I
and pure, there have been and will |
be Committees who "manipulate" j
important appointments,
j I
The Men's and Women's Council,
I for instance, now have power to de- !
I odorize the recurrent Daily election
| smells. To give any political body i
the potential power to "pack" a'
; Council for ulterior ends is to place j
an unnecessary temptation in the !
| hands of an Executive Committee, j
l The proposition should be voted 1
j down.
Now there are some who will say j
we ait; talking about Big Bad
Wolves, when on the Farm there
! are only fleecy white and sweet
| smelling sheep. But any shepherd
| will tell you that such an animal I
j does not exist.
