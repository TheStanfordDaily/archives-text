"LOVE TIME"
At the Varsity
"Love Time" is the operetta j
"Blossom Time"—the love life of |
Franz Schubert — adapted to the I
screen with fair fidelity. It is an'

idyllic produc
tion: love scenes
are tender,
country stills
are tranquil,'
court shots are I
magnificent.
As the music- I
al genius, Nils |

Asther is ideally cast. He not only
acts the temperamental part with
skill, but looks it. Pat Paterson,
however, misses as the girl of hith
erto unknown noble ancestry; she !
is sweet but slightly too ethereal.
The happily-ever-after ending is !
both a contrast to the tragic stage j
finale—Schubert's blindness—and a
distortion of historical fact.
—Mayer.
