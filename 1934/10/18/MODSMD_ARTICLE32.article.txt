THE THEATER IN NEW YORK:
11. The Season Moves Forward
(Continued from yesterday)
A play which received high praise
from the newspaper critics is Nor
man Krasna's Small Miracle. Re
ported as "fast, ingenious, and
thrilling," it was—to my opinion—
very slow in gaining pace, only as
ingenious as changing the Grand
Hotel model into a copy-set theater J
lounge was ingenious, and less
thrilling than The Distaff Side.
Krasna tried to attain the sardonic
irony that Ben Hecht mastered in
such a cleverly made film as Crime j
without Passion; but Krasna failed.
When the frequent and rapid trips
of a small girl to the ladies' par
ticular sanctuary pretend to be
comedy and constitute a major part
of the gage material in the show,
1 think myself justified in calling
the author a dull fellow. The di
rection was by George Abbott, who
failed to give his heterogeneous mob
the same motion and easy reality
that Russell Fillmore and Otto
Kruger gave to the coast production
of Counsellor-at-Law. But then, he
had far inferior material with which
to work. (
The most colossal theatrical note ,
is the production at the Center The
ater of the revised version of
Waltzes from Vienna, now called
The Great Waltz. Mr. Hassard SJiort, j
the manufacturer, has made use of
every conceivable stage mechanism.
The settings twirl happily about to
reveal other settings and the orches
tra pit wanders about the stage quite ;
without a care.
Unfortunately, this only tends to
blur the fact that the score is a
collection of Straus waltzes, splen
didly played by a fine orchestra but i
not aided by the fact that most of
them have gained lyrics and are i
sung.
The production is magnificent and
the mechanics remarkable; but be
tween the two they smother the
essential fact in any operetta: the
music. The stars do what they can
in the tremendous theater and, '
thank to an amplifying system, can !
be heard; the starry-eyed simplicity
of the romantic plot and dialogue
are traditional; but, it may be re
peated with justice, Strauss waltzes
should be played, not sung.
Meanwhile the D'Oyly Carte i
Company continues its brilliant way,
the Theater Guild season is about
to open, and Elmer Rice has a new'
play in rehearsal. Noel Coward's
Conversation Piece arrives in two j
weeks and Robert Sherwood has a
new play ready for production later
this year.
