# Allen Will Play Lemare Memorial Recital Today
## 
### 
A program in memoriam to Ed
win H. Lemare, one of England's
foremost organists, will be played
today by Warren D. Allen at his
regular Thursday afternoon recital
at 4:15 o'clock in the Memorial
Chapel. Lamare was born on the
Isle of Wight, and carried his suc
cess from England to America,
where he played brilliant perform
ances at the Carnegie Institute,
Pittsburgh, San Francisco, Portland,
Maine, and Chattanooga, Tenji.
Today his compositions are a little
obvious for modern listeners, but
they still show a great deal of the
individuality and charm of the mu
sician.
The program will be as follows:
Allegor pomposo, Opus 86
Folk Song (on a Christmas Carol by
Edwin Lemare, S. R.)
Gavotte Modeme
Romance in D Flat
Victory March, Opus 109.
