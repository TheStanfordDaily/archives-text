# DRAMA GROUP GIVES CHEKHOV PLAY READING
## 'Uncle Vanya' Lacks Talent And Brilliance of Other Presentations 
### 
For the first time in several quar
ters, a less than capacity audience
sat through a Sword and Sandals
reading when Chekhov's "Uncle
Vanya" was presented in the Little
Theatre last night.
Perhaps it was the rain that caused
the drop in attendance, perhaps it
was the unfortunate choice of the
playâ€”and perhaps those who stayed
away were right. For certainly the
production manifested none of the
brilliance, not even the talent, of last
year's Sword and Sandals presenta
tions.
Of those who appeared, Jacqueline
Johnson as Yelena was the best,
although her voice gave her some
trouble at the beginning. Still, she
approached closest to the character
she was playing. Neal Berry as Al
exandre Serebryakov was the best
of the men, approximating the
crotchety, conceited old man he
was supposed to be playing.
The choice ot the play was un
fortunate. It did not seem to move;
it lacked definite motivation. It was,
primarily, a commentary on human
motives and problems which the
actors were not adequate to bring
to life. Perhaps no amateur cast
could have done so. The questions
it concerned itself with are burnt
crut; they may have been questions
of moment when the play was writ
ten, but they are dead now.
The remainder of the cast included
Mary Ann Crary, Marjorie Melczer,
Zoe Rutherford, M. D. Caller Meyer,
and Roger Pryor.
