# Steedman Plans Ahead For Big Game Chappie
## 
### 
In preparation for Chappie's Big
Game number, Old Boy Gordon
Steedman called a bull session of all
artists, contributors, and potential
contributors in the Press building
library last night.
The theme of the magazine and
this year's editorial policy were dis
cussed. Steedman asks for all kinds
of short gags, puns, football takeofls,
and other humorous material. Any
one may turn in their jokes or ideas
at the Chaparral office before No
vember 1.
