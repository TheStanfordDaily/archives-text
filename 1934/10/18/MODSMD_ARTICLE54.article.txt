# Flight Experts Inspect New Type Plane Here
## 
### 
A new type of biplane, the Beech
croft, was flown here today from the i
factory by Mrs. Louise Thaden and
landed at 10 o'clock at the Palo Alto
flying field where it remained an
hour for inspection.
Professors Durand, Lesley, and
Reid of the Guggenheim Laboratory
were given a demonstration flight
and were very interested in the
.new negative stagger plane in which
the front of the upper wing is be
hind the 'front of the lower wing.
The advantages of this are that it
facilitates the pilot's view and has
other technical aerodynamic possi
bilities.
The plane has a high speed of 180
miles per hour, and excellent con
trol and maneuverability. It is
equipped with retractable landing
gear, which in flight folds up into
a cavity in the lower part of the
fuselage, the opening being com
pletely covered in such a way as to
present a clean, smooth surface for
the flow of air. The plane is also
equipped with one of the latest
forms of "flaps" for the purpose of
reducing speed at landing and aid
ing in control generally. The land
ing speed is 45 miles per hour.
