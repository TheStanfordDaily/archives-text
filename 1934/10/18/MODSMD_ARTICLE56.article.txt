# Comic Artist Holds Exhibit
## 
### 
Sketches by Louis Priscilla, reg
ular contributor to New Yorker,
Saturday Evening Post, Collier's,
Ballyhoo, and Hooey, are on exhibit
this # week in the Department of
Graphic Art.
The sketches are animated and
lively in character. They show a ;
good variety of techniques: wash
drawing, carbon pencil, pen and ink, |
and other commercial media. There I
is a suggestion of form, movement, â– 
and activity with a minimum of j
means.
Besides reproductions of drawings j
which have already appeared in
magazines, the exhibit includes sev- j
eral "roughs" or unfinished sketches. '
The work should be of interest to j
those who draw for Chaparral and
to those who have commercial draw
ing ambition.
Success came to Louis Priscilla |
within a comparatively short period
of time. Professor Mendelowitz of j
the graphic art department recalls i
the Priscilla of four years ago, j
sketching at the New York Art Stu- j
dents' League and submitting draw- j
ings to magazines without any strik- |
ing success.
