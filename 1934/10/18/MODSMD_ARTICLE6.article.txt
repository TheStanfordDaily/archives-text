# EX-COMMITTEE ACTION BRINGS BIG OPPOSITION
## Centralization of Power In Student Government Is Feared by Campus 
### 
The action of Ex Committee last
Tuesday night in revoking the lib
erty granted to Dramatics and
Activities Council by requiring that
their minutes must be approved by
Ex Committee along with their plac
ing on the October 25 ballot a meas
ure which would give Ex Commit
tee unrestricted appointive power
for all student body vacancies except
that of president, resurrects the old
ghost of centralization of power in
student government, according to
students opposing the moves.
President Marvie Kahn does not
fear the ghost. In urging the pas
sage of the second measure by Ex
Committee, Kahn pointed" out that
Ex Committee was a representative
group of students qualified to ex
press the opinions of the student
body as a whole.
Doubts Advisability
He also questicned the advisability
of allowing the two councils freedom,
while other councils were under the
jurisdiction of Ex Committee.
Kahn looked around at his com
mittee and said that he thought this
Ex Committee was not the kind of a
committee that would take undue
advantage of its powers.
With the last statement most of
the opposition agreed. Actions of
the Ex Committee and President
Kahn so far this year have shown
an unusual efficiency, clear-headed
ness, and desire to conduct their bus
iness for the best interests of the
school. What the opposition fears
is the action of future Ex Commit
tees.
Reasons Good
The opposition has good reason to
fear, judging by the actions of Ex
Committees of the past. It was only
two years ago that an Ex Committee
took into its hands the choosing of
a Dramatic Council play. "Hawk
Island," a hybrid play—an attempt to
reconcile sophisticated action with
a dime novel mystery plot—was se
lected over the protests of the Coun
cil. Despite wide publicity given the
play, it was a financial as well as
artistic failure.
An alternate plan is proposed by
the opposition: a mere review of
the minutes by Ex Committee with
financial control through the stu
dent manager and the power to
revoke the charters of offending or
ganizations.
General Trend
' Hawk Island' was only one in
stance, the "defenders of liberty"
admit, but they claim it represents a
general trend of Ex Committees to
use their power despotically. With
a second year term not desired or
permitted, Ex Committee members
are not controlled by the voters once
they have secured their votes, it is
said. Student government also has
no party system which holds itself
responsible for legislation passed.
With frequent use of the parliamen
tary but undemocratic closed ses
sion, Ex Committees of the past have
often taken actions of which the
general student body was entirely
ignorant.
It was due to the fear of such in
fluences in A.S.S.U. affairs that
Frank Fullenwidcr, Crompton Bangs,
and Elinor Kahn were careful to
give 150 voters the right to petition
for a special election when they
drafted the present A.S.S.U. con
stitution last spring.
Perhaps the circulation of such a
petition may prevent Ex Commit
tee's action to control the activities
of the two councils.
