# Indian Water Poloists Beat Lakeside, 7-0
## Fast Tilt Develops After Slow Warm-Up in Rain 
### 
Starting slowly but warming up as
the game wore on, Stanford defeated
Lakeside, 7 to 0, in the varsity game
last night in Encina pool. With the
Oakland swimmers holding the In
dians in check at first, the half-time
score was 3 to 0.
It was hard for the players to
warm up in the steady drizzle which
continued throughout the struggle.
Cold, damp weather of the past few
days had given Bob Foster, star for
ward, a cold serious enough to re
move him from the line-up. How
ever, Bill Clemo, junior college
transfer, who replaced him, turned
in a good job, and started the Cards
on their way with the first goal.
The junior varsity won 9-4.
Even play and numerous missed
shots because of close guarding oc
cupied the first few minutes before
Clemo broke the ice with a pretty
shot. Captain Leo Cook and Vlad
Taranik, Cardinal ace scorers, were
bottled up by an alert Lakeside de
fense for most of the first half. Both
scored in quick succession just be
fore the gun, however, Taranik from
the side and Cook on a beautiful
short shot.
Second Half Close
The water battle continued to be
much closer than the score indicates
in the second half, with the visitors
controlling the ball much of the
time, often threatening, and nar
rowly missing several shots. Gordon
Corson, Lakeside captain and guard,
looked dangerous in some expert
dribbling and passing.
After the ball had changed hands
in rapid fire fashion, and both
sides had been called on numerous
fouls, Cook again made a clever
short shot. Soon afterward Taranik
shot a pretty one from the corner to
make the score 5 to 0.
At this point Coach Nort Thorn
ton inserted Sutherlan in Benet's
guard position. The Lakesiders, who !
made no substitutions, began to tire, j
and Stanford held the upper hand
most of the time. With about two j
minutes of play remaining, Taranik
made a short shot for the Indians'
sixth goal.
Thornton sent in Harris and Myers
for Wiget and Woodard at guards
after Taranik's goal, and within a j
few seconds, Vlad made another nice j
shot to make the count 7-0. Shortly
after this the game ended with Stan
ford in possession of the ball.
Cook, Taranik Star
Cook, though closely guarded, and
Taranik starred for the Cards, all of
whom looked good on defense. Tara
nik led the scoring with four goals.
Cook made two and Clemo one to
complete the list. Corson was the
Lakeside star, guarding well and
almost scoring.
Tomorrow at 4:15 Stanford meets
much tougher opposition in the
powerful U.C.L.A. team, following â– 
a frosh game between the Papoose
and Palo Alto High School septets at
2:30. The varsity affair will be the
first Pacific Coast Conference game
of the season. Just after the Lake
side contest, Thornton predicted a
toss-up game against the Bruins.
Last year Stanford won a rough!
series by the scores of 3 to 2 and j
2 to 1. All students will be ad- 1
mitted free to these games, in Encina
pools.
