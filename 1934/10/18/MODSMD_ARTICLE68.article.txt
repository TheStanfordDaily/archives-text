# Dwyer, Little Meet in Golf
## Champion Expects To Meet Excellent Opposition 
### 
The fact that he was taking on the
, British and American Open cham
! pion did not disturb Tom Dwyer's
i peace of mind as he challenged Law
son Little for the number one golf
i team position yesterday. Little won
! the upper place in the bracket as
I the result of his summer campaign.
Dwyer came in to the challenging
position by virtue of shooting even
! par over the Stanford course in the
| qualifying rounds that were played
i last week on the campus. His first
i round tied Lawson Little's course
j record but was given precedence
| over it as Little's tally was made in !
match competition. His second qual- I
ifying round of 74 stood up in the i
first rank too. The nearest man be- 1
hind him, Spec Stewart, was two
strokes over in the qualifying rounds.
Little, if he is to be judged by the j
one round that has been publicized ,
since his return, is certainly in good
shape. He shot an even par despite j
the fact that he had two penalty
strokes. But if Dwyer pulls any 68's \
cut of the bag of tricks that he owns
it may be the fall of another giant.
No date has been agreed on as j

a challenge match on the team must
be played within one week or for- |
