INDIANS ARE
NEXT, MAYBE
Nearly ail the big teams are vic
tims of upsets this year — excepl
Stanford. And this writer will fee'
a whole lot better about the thing
if that is still a fact next week ai
this time.
All of which leads up to the point
that Stanford meets San Franeiscc
University this week. Stanford wil
be favored; in fact, it would be .sill>
lor anyone t<> seriously, on a merit
basis, to pick the Dons to win.
Hut the Cards are possibly more
apt (o he tipped Saturday than
any other time on their sched
ule. There is no reason for such
a statement, hut there it is.
The Dons almost did it last year.
Finally \Tiny Thornhill's Cardinal. l
sneaked out with a 20 to 13 victory,
after the game had been tied at
13-13 until the last few minutes.
Stanford excuses this because'she
had just returned from a trip to
Northwestern and did not have time
to prepare for the Dons.
The San Francisco team remem
bers this almost-a-victory, and they
have ideas of making it a real one
this year. But, say many, Stan
lord's team is better than it was at
this time in 1933.
U.S.F., however ,is also better,
much better, and they have that vic
tory complex. Last year they were
used to being barely beaten. But
this season thsy have fared better
on the close scores, and have finally
gotten the feel of a winning team.
Stanford is not taking the game
Saturday lightly. But the Indians
cannot afford to take it too se
scriously, either, what with El
Trojan slated for a combat here a
week later.
The Cardinals will be crippled for
the U.S.F. game, too. The injuries
would not be particularly serious, if
it were not for that game with Troy
next week. But in the team's va
rious vital spots hit by bruises and
wrenched muscles, and tendons,
Coach Thornhill will not take
chances by playing the victims of
these minor ailments during very
much of the game.
So Hobby Grayson and Hones
Hamilton, ace fullbacks; Hamil
ton and his first reserve at right
half, Gordon Head; Keith Top
ping, end, and Woody Adams,
guard, will all be used only part
time at best, with Topping and
Adams probably being kept on
the sidelines throughout.
This will hurt, not only offensive
ly, but defensively as well. And
with this handicap, the slightly
weaker Don group may be good
enough to score once, and possibly
oftener, while successfully defend
ing its own goal.
II Stanford loses any of its
other games (his year, unless that
be against the Olympic Club, it
will not come under the heading
ol a minor team defeating a major
team. Hut the Dons have every- <
tiling to gain and nothing to lose
when they meet the Indians, and
they will do everything they can
to make the most of it.
So Stanford mav set up a deep
sigh of relief if they are still one of
the two undefeated major teams on
the coast after Saturday.

INDIANS ARE
NEXT, MAYBE
Nearly ail the big teams are vic
tims of upsets this year — excepl
Stanford. And this writer will fee'
a whole lot better about the thing
if that is still a fact next week ai
this time.
All of which leads up to the point
that Stanford meets San Franeiscc
University this week. Stanford wil
be favored; in fact, it would be .sill>
lor anyone t<> seriously, on a merit
basis, to pick the Dons to win.
Hut the Cards are possibly more
apt (o he tipped Saturday than
any other time on their sched
ule. There is no reason for such
a statement, hut there it is.
The Dons almost did it last year.
Finally \Tiny Thornhill's Cardinal. l
sneaked out with a 20 to 13 victory,
after the game had been tied at
13-13 until the last few minutes.
Stanford excuses this because'she
had just returned from a trip to
Northwestern and did not have time
to prepare for the Dons.
The San Francisco team remem
bers this almost-a-victory, and they
have ideas of making it a real one
this year. But, say many, Stan
lord's team is better than it was at
this time in 1933.
U.S.F., however ,is also better,
much better, and they have that vic
tory complex. Last year they were
used to being barely beaten. But
this season thsy have fared better
on the close scores, and have finally
gotten the feel of a winning team.
Stanford is not taking the game
Saturday lightly. But the Indians
cannot afford to take it too se
scriously, either, what with El
Trojan slated for a combat here a
week later.
The Cardinals will be crippled for
the U.S.F. game, too. The injuries
would not be particularly serious, if
it were not for that game with Troy
next week. But in the team's va
rious vital spots hit by bruises and
wrenched muscles, and tendons,
Coach Thornhill will not take
chances by playing the victims of
these minor ailments during very
much of the game.
So Hobby Grayson and Hones
Hamilton, ace fullbacks; Hamil
ton and his first reserve at right
half, Gordon Head; Keith Top
ping, end, and Woody Adams,
guard, will all be used only part
time at best, with Topping and
Adams probably being kept on
the sidelines throughout.
This will hurt, not only offensive
ly, but defensively as well. And
with this handicap, the slightly
weaker Don group may be good
enough to score once, and possibly
oftener, while successfully defend
ing its own goal.
II Stanford loses any of its
other games (his year, unless that
be against the Olympic Club, it
will not come under the heading
ol a minor team defeating a major
team. Hut the Dons have every- <
tiling to gain and nothing to lose
when they meet the Indians, and
they will do everything they can
to make the most of it.
