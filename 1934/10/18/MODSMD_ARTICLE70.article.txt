# Injuries Weaken Card Grid Squad
## SICK LIST THROWS VARSITY OFF FORM FOR S.F.U. BATTLE Hamilton, lopping, Adams Out of Line-Up For Saturday Tilt 
### 
It would be just a shame if those
San Francisco University Dons
should hit the Stanford varsity like
the third string did last night in
scrimmage.
The Cardinals' undefeated record
would be shattered.
Stanford's Rose Bowl chances
would be decidedly diminished.
And the Indians would not be
nearly as heavily favored next week
when they meet U.S.C.
Stanford really did not look so
bad in scrimmage, but Tiny Thorn
hill's slightly crippled first string
* was off form both on offense and
defense just a little more than it
can safely be Saturday at Kezar
Stadium in San Francisco.
Team Hard Hit
From the cripple standpoint Stan
ford will not be in as bad a condition
as was formerly predicted. But the
Dons will find a Cardinal team more
vitally weakened by injuries than
any other Stanford opposition has
to date this season.
The sick list is not long, but it
strikes in just the wrong spots. It
hits right end and claims Keith Top
; ping, which will mean that probably
I Carlos Monsalve will start, leaving
' only Jack Clark as a capable reserve;
and Clark will be called on to aid at
both end positions.
Then it took its toll at left guard
by grabbing Wody Adams, behind
whom is Bob Black. And behind
Black there is little of varsity cali
ber.
It took a big bite at right halfback,
where it claimed Gordon Head, and
took partial claim on Bones Ham
ilton. The latter will be ready to
play, but he will not be used more
than part of the game, and even dur
ing the time he is in, he may have
to assist Bobby Grayson, another
partial cripple, with the fullback du
ties. So Chuck White will be called
upon for some right halfbacking.
Bob Reynolds and Jim Moscrip at
left tackle and end looked consist
ently good in' the scrimmage, and
Grayson gave little evidence of his
hip injury, which confined him to
th* sidelines through the North
western game last Saturday.
For the third string, Ray Todd
showed considerable offensive drive, |
and Earl Hoos looked good defen- '
sively at diagnosing varsity plays. 1
