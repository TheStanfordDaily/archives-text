Two easy victories and a pair of
close contests mark the results of
yesterday's bill of fare of mural
touch football, which included the

of 33-0, with a continuous barrage
of passes which the Kappa Alpha
outfit was unable to cope with.

win over the Menlo Juniors by vir
tue of a sustained drive in the early
minutes of the game.
Theta Chi's aggregation defeated
The Forgers 7 to 0 in the fourth
contest of the day. All games were
run off in spite of threatening
weather and wet playing fields.
Sig Nu May Repeat
Sigma Nu proved itself a formi
dable contender to repeat its last
year record as it unleashed an un
beatable passing attack that had the
Sequoia men completely befuddled.
Bud Shreve starred for the Row men
as he was on the heaving end of all
his team's touchdown passes, as well
as running the ball for one of the
scores. Leidig made some beautiful
catches as he snagged several long
passes for Sigma scores. Eighteen
of the winner's points were the
results of this pass combination.
Mullen and Baushach played well for
Sigma Nu while Dean and Merchant
starred for the losers.
Campo obtained their victory over
Menlo by virtue of an early touch
down march marked by a long pass

from which it was shoved over after
several attempts. Conversion failed.
Both Squads Threaten
Neither team was able to score
after this, though Tally, who led the
Campo attack, ran left end for 50
yards after faking a pass. He was
finally hauled down on the Menlo
30 as the half ended. Both teams
threatened in the second half with
no damage resulting. Campo' 1 ; ae
rial offense gave them the edge in
this closely contested battle.
Led by the passing of Wardwell,
who heaved five long passes in suc
cession to give his team a score in
the early minutes of the game, the
Phi Sigs had no trouble with the
Kappa Alphas. CrifTm, Worley, and
Stice were on the receiving ends of
the Kappa Sigs' potent pass attack.
Led by Jim Trompas, Theta Chi
obtained a one-touchdown victory
over a stubborn Forger aggregation
in close game on the Frosh
baseball field.
