# New Speech Professor Has Varied Experience
## 
### 
Raised on a country newspaper I
where he served as everything from
office devil to editor —the latter dur
j ing the two weeks' honeymoon of
i the real editor—Edward Z. Rowell,
j Stanford's new professor of public
! speaking, who is this year taking
j the place of Lee Emerson Bassett,
• head of Stanford's public speaking
' department, who is on sabbatical
leave, had a wide experience and
I background before he even entered
! high school.
Claiming Minnesota as his birth
place, and 1885 as his natal year,
(which should make him 49 if our
i arithmetic is correct), the quiet,
| scholarly, yet cordial professor
| speaks reminiscent ly of his years
1 spent at the University of Chicago,
where he acquired and
; Ph.D. degrees in philosophy.
Rowell's first teaching experience
came at Carleton College, where he
taught philosophy and psychology,
i Later, still teaching philosophy, he
j returned to his alma mater; and fi
: nally he came to the University of
j California, where he has taught
Argumentation for the past 14 years,
j and where he will return next year.
He is listed in the American Men
[ of Science as an investigator of
I Lspeech phenomena, and his work
! "Prolegomena (which means intro
j duction) to Argumentation" repre
j sents one of the crucial discussions
j of modern problems in that field.
Rowell has long been a pioneer in
I the discussion type of debate (which
j Stanford encourages, but does not |
( use exclusively), and has served on
; several speech committees with
} Stanford's Professor Bassett in re-
I cent years. He claims "scholarly in- |
j terest in the theoretical problems of |
rhetoric," and emphasizes the intel- :
lectual side of speech, believing, as
j do his Berkeley associates, that "in <
' older to make a student a good ■
1 speaker, we must make him a good j
thinker."
j At Stanford he hopes to find an i

academic spirit—interest in study—
such as occurs in his old alma mater;
and so far he .says that his impres
sions have been very favorable.
Rowell is serving as assistant to
Lee Chapin, varsity debate coach,
and is also coach of the women's
debate squad. He smilingly de
clined to comment on Stanford's
women debaters.

Claiming Minnesota as his birth
place, and 1885 as his natal year,
(which should make him 49 if our
i arithmetic is correct), the quiet,
| scholarly, yet cordial professor
| speaks reminiscent ly of his years

where he acquired and
; Ph.D. degrees in philosophy.
Rowell's first teaching experience
came at Carleton College, where he
taught philosophy and psychology,
i Later, still teaching philosophy, he
j returned to his alma mater; and fi
: nally he came to the University of
j California, where he has taught
Argumentation for the past 14 years,
j and where he will return next year.
He is listed in the American Men
[ of Science as an investigator of
I Lspeech phenomena, and his work
! "Prolegomena (which means intro
j duction) to Argumentation" repre
j sents one of the crucial discussions
j of modern problems in that field.
Rowell has long been a pioneer in
I the discussion type of debate (which
j Stanford encourages, but does not |
( use exclusively), and has served on
; several speech committees with
} Stanford's Professor Bassett in re-
I cent years. He claims "scholarly in- |
j terest in the theoretical problems of |
rhetoric," and emphasizes the intel- :
lectual side of speech, believing, as
j do his Berkeley associates, that "in <
' older to make a student a good ■
1 speaker, we must make him a good j
thinker."
j At Stanford he hopes to find an i

academic spirit—interest in study—
such as occurs in his old alma mater;
and so far he .says that his impres
sions have been very favorable.
Rowell is serving as assistant to
Lee Chapin, varsity debate coach,
and is also coach of the women's
debate squad. He smilingly de
clined to comment on Stanford's
women debaters.
