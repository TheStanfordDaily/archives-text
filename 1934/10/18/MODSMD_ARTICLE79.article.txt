### 
Using Doc Luckett, speedy little
half, almost exclusively in the ball
carrying duties, the frosh went
through the gamut of their offensive
plays against the Grays yesterday
afternoon.
Luckett got off some long runs he
hind a second-string line. Bill Paul
man and Glenn Hamilton alternated
at the key fullback post, and threw
the passes, the majority of which
were knocked down by Gray sec
ondary men.
Team physician Fritz Roth yester
day pronounced Don Gregory well
and fit to play. Gregory, a guard,
had been out since the first week
with a wrenched shoulder. Grant
Stone, who had been out with a bro
ken nose, is also ready and scrim
maged yesterday, fronted by a large
leather mask.
The frosh travel up the peninsula
j Saturday to meet the strong San
' Mateo J.C. eleven in San Mateo. The
jaysees have previously been beaten
by the Cal babes, so a contrast can
j be made between the two rivals.
