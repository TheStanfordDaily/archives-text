# FARM MAY GET ULTRA-MODERN THEATER SOON
## Wilbur, Roth, Committee Approve Drawings For Group SEATING CAPACITY 1000 Memorial Court Available For Outdoor Theater 
### Annalee Whitmore 
One of the most complete and
technically perfect theatre groups
in the entire United States, pictured
at the right, may shortly be erected
on the Stanford campus.
The accompanying architects'
drawing shows a cross-section of the
structure which was so enthusiasti
cally approved Wednesday by Pres
ident Ray Lyman Wilbur, Comp
troller Almon E. Roth, and the Ex
ecutive Committee.
In the forefront is the Memorial
Court, surrounded by arcades con
taining placques in memory of Stan
ford men lost in the World War. The
court is also adapted to use as an
outdoor theatre, long desired but
previously considered unattainable
According to specifications, the
court will measure approximately
278 by 200 feet. The arcades en
closing it resemble in appearance
those of the Women's Gymnasium,
but will be on a considerably
larger scale.
Backing the court is the imposing
Memorial Tower, which illustrates
one of the most ingenious devices
possible in architecture. The un
sightly expanse of blank wall which
usually constitutes the stage back
has been entirely eliminated.
The theatre, instead of facing the
court, has its entrance directly oppo
site. The rear of the theatre has
been transformed, by means of ap
plied pilasters and inscriptions, into
the distinctive tower forming the
nucleus of the group.
Schools Included
Flanking the theatre, and directly
behind the court, will be the School
of the Theatre, consisting of rehear
sal rooms, studio, storage rooms, two
offices, library, costume room, de
sign room, four rooms for lighting,
mechanical, and technical staff, prep
rooms, and a green room.
A further possibility now under
consideration is that of having a
School of Drama on one side and a
similar School of Music on the other,
thus making the theatre facilities
available to both.
Both the court, with its surround
ing arcades, and the sections con
taining the dramatic school arc to be
of reinforced class "C" construction
similar to the Women's Gymnasiurp.
To Seat 1000
The theatre itself is slated to have
a seating capacity of 1000, of which
850 will be on the main floor and
150 in the balcony. This may be
increased to approximately 1200, if
an executive committee recommen
dation is carried through, and will
be of class "A" fireproof steel and
concrete.
Total estimated cost of the com
pleted project, including a $12,000
air conditioning unit, is $356,983.04.
This totals only 1G cents per cubic
foot, while the Women's Gym, of in
ferior construction, cost 15.7 cents.
An area almost the size of the
entire seating space will constitute
the stage proper. The complete stage
block will surpass anything on the
Coast except the Memorial Opera
House.

Statistics show Stanford co-eds
tallest in United States.
