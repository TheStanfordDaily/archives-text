# Bridge Feud Continues; Willis Answers U.C. Prof
## 
### 
The south pier foundation of the
Golden Gate bridge is not safe!
Thus flatly does Dr. Bailey Willis,
emeritus professor of geology, con
tradict Professor Andrew C. Law
son of the University of California
who contradicted Dr. Willis.
•Professor Lawson states that the
bridge structure is imbedded in
"solid serpentine rock." "Had he
omitted the word 'solid'," stated Dr.
Willis, "I could agree, but the rock
can be seen in the cliffs and slides
between Marshall Beach and Fort
Scott and will be found to consist
of hard boulders and a soft matrix
like talc. If you strike a block with
a hammer it breaks into many pieces.
This is not 'solid' in any/sense that,
can reasonably be applied to a firm
foundation."
Dr. Willis claims that there is a
fault running under the proposed
pier site. Professor Lawson denies
its existence. "I have today re
examined the cliffs along that
stretch," said Dr. Willis last night,
"and the evidence of faulting is ob
vious and unmistakable. The line of
fault can be traced out beyond the
site of the south pier. The plane of

the fault slopes toward the east and
passes under (he south pier, Planes ,
of this character are well known to '
all geologists as causes of slides, and I
this is in no respect to be regarded
as an exception."
In an article published in a San
Francisco paper last April, Lawson
is quoted as saying, "1 have been 1
watching the cliffs where the south
pier is located for 44 years and this
is the first time that I knew I was
looking at a series of landslides."
Dr. Willis produced a photograph of
the clifTs which showed obvious j
.slides. "The fact that the serpentine
haj; slid," said Dr. Willis, "leaving
steep faces above and loose, piled up
masses below is obvious to anyone
who will examine the slope south of
Fort Scott."
Professor Lawson had said, "The
language Dr. Willis uses indicates :
malicious intentions."
"The malignity of my statements,"
said Dr. Willis, "lies in the fact that
I am defending the public interest
since the public will have to pay the i
bill for the bridge, including the
emoluments of those employed to
build it."

omitted the word 'solid'," stated Dr.
Willis, "I could agree, but the rock
can be seen in the cliffs and slides
between Marshall Beach and Fort
Scott and will be found to consist
of hard boulders and a soft matrix
like talc. If you strike a block with
a hammer it breaks into many pieces.
This is not 'solid' in any/sense that,
can reasonably be applied to a firm
foundation."
Dr. Willis claims that there is a
fault running under the proposed
pier site. Professor Lawson denies
its existence. "I have today re
examined the cliffs along that
stretch," said Dr. Willis last night,
"and the evidence of faulting is ob
vious and unmistakable. The line of
fault can be traced out beyond the
site of the south pier. The plane of

the fault slopes toward the east and
passes under (he south pier, Planes ,
of this character are well known to '
all geologists as causes of slides, and I
this is in no respect to be regarded
as an exception."
In an article published in a San
Francisco paper last April, Lawson
is quoted as saying, "1 have been 1
watching the cliffs where the south
pier is located for 44 years and this
is the first time that I knew I was
looking at a series of landslides."
Dr. Willis produced a photograph of
the clifTs which showed obvious j
.slides. "The fact that the serpentine
haj; slid," said Dr. Willis, "leaving
steep faces above and loose, piled up
masses below is obvious to anyone
who will examine the slope south of
Fort Scott."
Professor Lawson had said, "The
language Dr. Willis uses indicates :
malicious intentions."
"The malignity of my statements,"
said Dr. Willis, "lies in the fact that
I am defending the public interest
since the public will have to pay the i
bill for the bridge, including the
emoluments of those employed to
build it."
