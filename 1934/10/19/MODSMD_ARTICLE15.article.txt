# GROUP FAVORS REVOCATION OF COUNCIL MOVE
## Campus Organizations Gain Freedom by New Move Of Student Heads 
### Loren Irwin 
A telephone poll of eight Ex Com
mittee members last night revealed
that a majority of seven to one favor
the revoking of last Tuesday night's
action concerning the i*epeal of the
privileges of the Activities and Dra
matics Councils.
It was indicated, moreover, that a
majority of the group advocate com
plete freedom of all campus organi
zations to govern themselves, and
will vote to allow all subsidiary or
ganizations freedom of action within
their constitutional rights at Tues
day's regular meeting.
Moderate Action
Last Tuesday's action was taken,
apparently through no will of the
Ex Committee to absolutely sub
ordinate subsidiary groups, but to
aid in their decisions. Upon cohsid
eration, the majority of the members
of the Ex Committee believe that
the action taken should be moder
ated by stating that the minutes of
the minor councils should merely be
reviewed subject to suggestions from
the Ex Committee.
Marvin Kahn, president of the
student body, says, "I believe that
the Ex Committee should have the
power to review the minutes and
suggest changes to be acted upon at
the discretion of the groups con
cerned. This should be augmented
by the power to withdraw the com
mittee's charter should sufficient
cause arise. I shall suggest this
change at the next meeting of the
Ex Committee Tuesday."
Statement Confirmed
Others of the committee who con
firm Kahn's statement are A1 Black
man, senior man; Helen Ray, vice
president; Mort O'Evelyn, sopho
more man; Woodward Adams, jun
ior man; Barbara Holmes, senior
woman, and Sam Lee, senior man.
Unanimously, they favor the inde
pendence of all campus organizations
to govern themselves.
Lone member to uphold the Com
mittee's decision, Charles Glasgow,
graduate member, says, "I am posi
tively in favor of the Ex Committee
having full control over the Dra
matics and Activities Councils with
complete power over the minutes
of these councils."
Those irritated members of the
student body who contemplated a
petition will rest at ease with the
conviction that the Ex Committee
will surely revoke its action of last
week next Tuesday night.
Vivian Kay and Bill Stark could
not be readied late last night, for
statements of their opinion.

that a majority of seven to one favor
the revoking of last Tuesday night's
action concerning the i*epeal of the
privileges of the Activities and Dra
matics Councils.
It was indicated, moreover, that a
majority of the group advocate com
plete freedom of all campus organi
zations to govern themselves, and
will vote to allow all subsidiary or
ganizations freedom of action within
their constitutional rights at Tues
day's regular meeting.
Moderate Action
Last Tuesday's action was taken,
apparently through no will of the
Ex Committee to absolutely sub
ordinate subsidiary groups, but to
aid in their decisions. Upon cohsid
eration, the majority of the members
of the Ex Committee believe that
the action taken should be moder
ated by stating that the minutes of
the minor councils should merely be
reviewed subject to suggestions from
the Ex Committee.
Marvin Kahn, president of the
student body, says, "I believe that
the Ex Committee should have the
power to review the minutes and
suggest changes to be acted upon at
the discretion of the groups con
cerned. This should be augmented
by the power to withdraw the com
mittee's charter should sufficient
cause arise. I shall suggest this
change at the next meeting of the
Ex Committee Tuesday."
Statement Confirmed
Others of the committee who con
firm Kahn's statement are A1 Black
man, senior man; Helen Ray, vice
president; Mort O'Evelyn, sopho
more man; Woodward Adams, jun
ior man; Barbara Holmes, senior
woman, and Sam Lee, senior man.
Unanimously, they favor the inde
pendence of all campus organizations
to govern themselves.
Lone member to uphold the Com
mittee's decision, Charles Glasgow,
graduate member, says, "I am posi
tively in favor of the Ex Committee
having full control over the Dra
matics and Activities Councils with
complete power over the minutes
of these councils."
Those irritated members of the
student body who contemplated a
petition will rest at ease with the
conviction that the Ex Committee
will surely revoke its action of last
week next Tuesday night.
Vivian Kay and Bill Stark could
not be readied late last night, for
statements of their opinion.
