# droffie predicts record crowd of 900 for s. c. tilt

(Very close relative of Sylvestre)
Today is the final chance for
the Stanford rough and multi
tudes of campus women to se
cure for themselves pasteboard
tickets for the S.C. game.
The sale of tickets perked up
considerably yesterday, at least
400 men and women signifying
their intentions of attending
what used to be called a rather
popular grid conflict. This
year's advance sale makes
Stanford attendance at the
game seem rather dubious.
Letters from the rainy South
indicate that El Trojan is plan
ning not to fill out rooting sec
tion. but rather two, since a
telegram received yesterday
asked for a stadium plan for
two sections.
Droffie has come to the in
fallible conclusion that a three
thousand or so rooting section
traveling five hundred miles to
see the game, sort of puts to
shame the scattered 5(00 souls
who have to walk 300 yards
into the stadium from the Row
and the Halls to watch their re
putedly strong gridders match
brawn against the Trojans.
At any rate, 566 men have
purchased ducats, as compared
to 334 women. There is room
in the section for 1,000 more
men and 300 additional women.
Graduate Manager A1 Mas
ters announces that after five
o'clock today, no more tickets
may be purchased, and Rally
Committee heads will plan to
scat just those purchasers sold
by deadline.
