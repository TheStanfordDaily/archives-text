# Conference Party Slated For Tonight
## Games, Skits, Dancing Provide Entertainment

ously tagged, have been selected to
act as hostesses at tonight's Women's
Conference Party, attended by mem
bers of the "1000," and slated to last

all features of "rushing" from the
affair, Hall and Row women alike
have pledged themselves to attend.
Old and new women will be dis

ting in" will be facilitated by the
name tags, worn by both new and
previously-registered students.

and head residents also plan to be
present as patrons.
