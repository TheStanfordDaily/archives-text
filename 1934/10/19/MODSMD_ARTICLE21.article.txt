# Optimistic Dons May End Indian Winning Streak
## Logic Gives Stanford Odds, But Psychology Favors Tricky S.F.U. Gridmen in Non-Conference Contest at Kezar Tomorrow 
### MILLARD BROWNE 
A lot of optimism and fight, plus a few offensive tricks, will defend
the San Francisco University goal tomorrow afternoon against a slightly
crippled, smoothly-functioning, favored, hut not quite so inspired Stanford
Cardinal invasion of Ke/ar Stadium.

â–º In picking a score, there is no
logical answer but that Stanford will
defeat San Francisco's Dons by a
very slight margin.
But logic has no place in this
year's football world, and even if it
did, it probably wouldn't count in
tomorrow's game.
So on the basis of sentiment,
hunches, psychology, or whatever
else enters in, and ignoring man -
for-man power and the abovc-dis
credited logic, the two squads may be
rated even choices as they enter the
field tomorrow.
Coach Spud Lewis of the Dons,
i after being ofTered every chance to
be pessimistic, chose a brighter out
look, and insists his San Franciscans
have a very good chance, which
| they have.

Lewis believes his fullback, Ray
Peterson, will outkick Stanford's
Frankie Alustiza, and that his star
halfback, Mike Bacciarini, is a bet
ter passer than anyone the Cards
can offer. He further gives away
nothing to the Stanford line, which
has been the basis of rating the In
dians better than every other team
they have met this year.
Other minor points that make
Lewis radiate optimism are the ball
carrying and signal-calling powers
of Bacciarini, a junior college trans
fer who has broken into the "big
time" with a flourish, and the of
fensive and defensive sparkling of his
ail-American candidate for center,
Larry Seimering.
In the meantime Tiny Thornhill is
calmly proceeding with the Cardinal
preparations for a busy mid- and
late-season football campaign.'
He fully realizes the seriousness of
the situation, and has devoted' a few
days' practice primarily to the San
Francisco game. Thornhill has no
apologies to offer for his team, and
he has every right to believe that a
strong dose of Grayson, Hamilton,
Alustiza, Van Dellen, and Maentz
will be enough to squelch Mr. Lewis,
a very, very ambitious young grad
uate of the Farm.
Gordon Head is the only Indian
back who will not play against the
Dons. The line did not fare as well
with the injury problem, however,
and Keith Topping and Woody Ad
ams both will be missing from their
regular starting positions at end and
guard.
The probable starting line-ups:
S. F. U. Pos. Stanford
Wilson LE Moscrip
Let low LT Reynolds
Pccheu LG Black
Seimering C Brandin
Shaw RG Rouble
Barber RT Callaway
Bugge RE Clark
Leonardo Q Alustiza
Bacciarini LH Van Dellen
King RH Hamilton
Peterson F Grayson
