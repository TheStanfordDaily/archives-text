# Of the People For the Campus

### 
Ex Committee members guaranteed the
campus a return to popular government in
all cases last night when seven of its members
went on record as favoring the independence
of subsidiary A.S.S.I', organizations.
Last Tuesday, the same group unanimously
voted to require that action of any organiza
tion must be approved by the Ex Committee
in official approval of the smaller body's min
utes.
Since that time, the Daily recalled the abuse
of that power by a domineering Executive
Committee of 1932 3.3, and present members
agree that, although no dictatorial policy is
contemplated Ibis year, subsidiary organiza
tions should be granted protection in future
emergencies.
A wise move, an indication that student
heads are honestly interpreting the duties of
office for the best interests of clean campus
politics, it leave# the A.S.S.I', in tire neatest
condition of recent years.
For once, there are no politically minded
cliques on the governing body of the Asso
ciated Students.
