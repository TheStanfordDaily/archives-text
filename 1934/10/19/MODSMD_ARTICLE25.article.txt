After a decade of picayune politics and
bonus hood ling, the esteemed American Le
gion appears on the verge of plunging into
a constructive campaign. Certain it is, that
the intelligent observer has never before rec
ognized such heartening signs as are now on
the wing in Miami, scene of this year's Na
tional Convention,
It is their cry for universal conscription in
wartime of industry and wealth as well as
man power, to which we refer. But it is a
ribbed and rock-strewn road which they must
pursue; a way which may remind them un
pleasantly of Argonne forest, or for the less
fortunate who "didn't get across," of the pri
vations of K.P. duty at ('amp Kearney.
We prophesy that it will be a good deal
more laborious to convince the Duponts or
tlie Rockefellers that they should give up their
industries to the government than it was to
belabor a Congressman into approval of bigger
and better bonuses. Why, the former is some
dad-ratted species of socialism, is it not?
However, if they insist on taking a shot at
the moon, more power to 'em. Someone ought
to score a hit soon. Hut there are some pro
visions in their policies which put these juve
nile brains in a dither.
The Legion will ask the "freezing" of prices
at a pre-war level so that "private gain" could
not result from the national emergency. We
suggest that is far easier to ask for than to
accomplish but, no doubt, the Legion's erudite
economic department is wrestling with this
problem, and the solution will be shortly
forthcoming.
