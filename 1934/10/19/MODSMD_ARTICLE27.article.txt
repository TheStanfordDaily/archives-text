# And Campus Dances
## 
### 
The lirsl all-University dance to he given
under the new Constitution hv the Activities
Council illustrated the point that when prop
erly handled, a campus affair provides lots
of tum and entertainment at less than a third
of the cost of "going to the city."
It cannot he compared to the earlier Regis
tration Dance, because il catered to the wishes
of the campus as a whole. Admittedly, there
is probably room for the improvement that
comes with experience. The A.S.S.I'. event
next week should show thai Stanford dances
are "Ihe things to do."
