## WARDEN LAWES AND HIS "BOYS" 
### BOB JONES 
Because the townfolk of Sing Sing decided that the
name of their prison-famed town on the banks of the
Hudson bore too odious a sound and conveyed grim
thoughts of Nfrw York state's prison, the name of the
town was changed to Ossining.
Directly to the south of the renamed town on a hill
lies the white-walled state penitentiary.
Head of Sing Sing is Warden Lewis Edward Lawes
who has gained national prominence in the movies, in
the Press, and by his stand against capital punishment.
The warden's office was a buzzing and hum
ming spot that bright morning in the middle ol'
June. Two men were to be electrocuted that night.
The communication wires to the office were kept
"hot" with calls from Albany. There remained a
faint possibility that Governor Lehman might
reprieve the condemned at the last moment.
A big, burly, good-natured sergeant of the guard
was designated by the warden to take me on a
several-hour tour of inspection of the entire prison,
including the gory details of the "death house."
There were few details which we didn't touch—
from the hospital to the electric chair. The only for
bidden place was the condemned-cell block. A permit
from the state supreme court was necessary to gain
entrance to that exclusive region.
A regular station wagon service carried the guards
and employees around in the prison grounds.
A fully equipped and managed hospital with a
dental section and laboratory was the first point of
scrutiny.
Dismal and awesome was the old cell block, built in
the early nineteenth century—six tiers of cells piled
into a three-story stone building. The individual cells
were small, dark dungeons, so far as I could see—a
"bed" in a pitch black cell about three feet wide and
seven feet long. When a convict first entered the prison
he was placed in this old cell block. After several
months of good behavior in the dismal "dungeon," he
might be "promoted" to the new cell block which ranks
with practically any hall or fraternity on the Stanford
campus for accommodations!
Movies are shown several times a month. Three dif
ferent church services are held every Sunday morning
in the large recreational wing of the new cell block.
Sing Sing goes in for athletics in a "big way."
Handball courts are everywhere. There is a large
sandy football field and baseball diamond. The
grid team plays regular games with outside squads
—but within the walls, One large movie outfit,
which was granted permission recently to film part
of a picture within the prison grounds, is building
a huge gym, similar to the Stanford pavilion, on
the grounds as a gift to the prison for permission
to make the picture.
In the sheet metal shop prisoners can make half a
dollar a day doing skilled labor. The shop turns out
all the ash cans for New York City. Prisoners thus
learn trades in the various prison shops.
Over in a quiet spot in the grounds is the red brick
"death house." In a side room is the electrocution
chamber where two men were to be electrocuted that
night. The chamber was similar to those pictured in
the movies. The chair sits in the middle of the far
end of the barren room. The "pews" for the necessary
witnesses are to the side and back, facing the chair.
Otherwise the room is empty.
Just inside a doorway at the side of the chair is
the switchboard with the lever which sends two thou
sand volts through the condemned person. Further, in
this side room, was a stretcher with clothes for the
two men slated to die that night. To the side was
the ice box to place the bodies in preparation for
burial the next day.
Contrary to stories and the movies, the lights do not
dim, the sergeant told me, when the current is turned
on for the electrocution.
New York was a more pleasant place, so I left for
the big city.
This is the last of a series of ten yarns by Bob
Jones, wandering Daily reporter.
