Can Germany "corne back" financially and econom
ically? Latest news flashes from Berlin indicate the
desperate fight being made by the Third Reich to
place the nation on a firm fiscal basis.
Dr. Ralph Haswell Lutz, executive head of the
history department, and director-in-chief of the Hoover
War Library, believes after analyzing latest reports that
Germany is on an upgrade economic road. The pro
fessor points out, however, that Reich exports compete
with American, British, French and Japanese manu
facturers and are consequently not needed by these
countries. Imports, which are the life-blood of Ger
many's industry —iron, copper ,cotton, oil—must come,
on the other hand, from these nations.
Heroic efforts arc being made by Germany
at present to loosen the tight Gordian eco
nomic-financial knot which ties her hands. The
ink is carcely dry on the Reich's formal notice to
United States which carries the announcement of
Germany's intent to terminate its unconditional
most-favored-nation commercial accord with this
country on October 14, 1935.
This pact has been in force since 1925, and Dr.
Hans Luther's communique to Secretary Hull indi
cates that in her fight to regain foreign markets,
the Reich does not wish her hands tied by restric
tive pacts. Dr. Luther expressed the wish that a
reciprocal German-American agreement minus
the most-favored-nation clause could be signed to
replace the 1925 commercial understanding.
War-clouds have twice blackened the European
horizon during the past four months. Is war immi
nent? is the universal question. Dr. Lutz, an expert
on the European political situation, and author of nu
merous world war works, believes the likelihood of
immediate war is remote.
"Balkanization of Europe was the result of the
Treaty of Versailles, and everyone expected to see the
new status quo upset. Wrangling and suspicion en
gendered friction between the former Allied powers.
The rise of National Socialism, however, has had pow
erful political repercussions in Europe, with the result
that the Allies of 1914-18 are once more together.
"The former Allies again seeing facts somewhat eye
to eye is in itself a powerful deterrent 1o war, which
even assassinations cannot disturb. It is difficult to see
what the alignment would be in case of war.
Dr. Ludwig Muller, newly invested with the office
of Reichsbischof, Dr. Lutz believes will have a gigantic
task in achieving his objective of creating a United
Evangelical hurch of solidarity. The professor points
out that since the Hitler regime will doubtless remain
in power for many years to come, the Reichsbischof
should at length succeed in welding into religious
homogeneity the great mass of the German people,
through a process of gradual indoctrination.
Return to the Norse sagas and legends? Dr. Lutz
believes not. "Germany was the cradle of the Refor
mation, is a Christian nation essentially, and will
remain so."

Dr. Ralph Haswell Lutz, executive head of the
history department, and director-in-chief of the Hoover
War Library, believes after analyzing latest reports that
Germany is on an upgrade economic road. The pro
fessor points out, however, that Reich exports compete
with American, British, French and Japanese manu
facturers and are consequently not needed by these
countries. Imports, which are the life-blood of Ger
many's industry —iron, copper ,cotton, oil—must come,
on the other hand, from these nations.
Heroic efforts arc being made by Germany
at present to loosen the tight Gordian eco
nomic-financial knot which ties her hands. The
ink is carcely dry on the Reich's formal notice to
United States which carries the announcement of
Germany's intent to terminate its unconditional
most-favored-nation commercial accord with this
country on October 14, 1935.
This pact has been in force since 1925, and Dr.
Hans Luther's communique to Secretary Hull indi
cates that in her fight to regain foreign markets,
the Reich does not wish her hands tied by restric
tive pacts. Dr. Luther expressed the wish that a
reciprocal German-American agreement minus
the most-favored-nation clause could be signed to
replace the 1925 commercial understanding.
War-clouds have twice blackened the European
horizon during the past four months. Is war immi
nent? is the universal question. Dr. Lutz, an expert
on the European political situation, and author of nu
merous world war works, believes the likelihood of
immediate war is remote.
"Balkanization of Europe was the result of the
Treaty of Versailles, and everyone expected to see the
new status quo upset. Wrangling and suspicion en
gendered friction between the former Allied powers.
The rise of National Socialism, however, has had pow
erful political repercussions in Europe, with the result
that the Allies of 1914-18 are once more together.
"The former Allies again seeing facts somewhat eye
to eye is in itself a powerful deterrent 1o war, which
even assassinations cannot disturb. It is difficult to see
what the alignment would be in case of war.
Dr. Ludwig Muller, newly invested with the office
of Reichsbischof, Dr. Lutz believes will have a gigantic
task in achieving his objective of creating a United
Evangelical hurch of solidarity. The professor points
out that since the Hitler regime will doubtless remain
in power for many years to come, the Reichsbischof
should at length succeed in welding into religious
homogeneity the great mass of the German people,
through a process of gradual indoctrination.
Return to the Norse sagas and legends? Dr. Lutz
believes not. "Germany was the cradle of the Refor
mation, is a Christian nation essentially, and will
remain so."
Can Germany "corne back" financially and econom
ically? Latest news flashes from Berlin indicate the
desperate fight being made by the Third Reich to
place the nation on a firm fiscal basis.
