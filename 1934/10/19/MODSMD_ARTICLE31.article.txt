### MILADY WILL WEAR 
| The good God whp made green
apples and humming birds, flies and
spiders, lions and tigers, also took
time out to create man and woman.
To green apples and humming birds,
flies and spiders, lions and tigers, He
gave ready-made clothing. To man
1 qnd woman He also gave ready-madp
clothing, but accidentally threw in
brains to make the picture complete.

The reason for that fatal addition
is one of the great unknowables. Un
troubled by deep convolutions, pro
truding cerebrums, and such trivia,
apples were content to be green and
red, flies to be black, and lions
pleasantly tawny. Man alone —with
the bug buzzing furiously under his
bonnet — betook himself to alter
things-as-they-were. And that be
gan the fun which makes the Man
from Mars wear out a dozen shirt
| sleeves with ill-suppressed laughter.
* *
Man stuck glass through his nose,
j and rings through his ears. Woman
was even worse. She distorted her
lips and lengthened her neck. She
stuck herself in straitjackets rivaling
the worst furies of the Inquisition.
Then she broadened out with bustles,
and added dead hair to her own
natural quota. She dropped her
skirts to the gutter, picked them up
j again, and dropped them again, ad
: infinitum. Obviously she was in one
hell of a quandary.

Now of course we laugh at such
things. They are things of the past,
i But literally at the drop of a hat,
the population—especially the femi
nine and weaker half—is ready to
j go through all the weird tortures and
embarrassments of a century ago.
! Until a few years ago, no one could
have made the nation believe that
i otherwise intelligent women would
j fall for Eugenie hats, red toenails,
| and French heels. For the benefit of
i Stanford's new women, we may add
that even the smart and snooty five
; hundred (as we were wont to think
: of them) fell for the whole truck
| along with Woolworth (adv.) shop
girls and Emporium (adv.) ribbon
clerks.
* * *
And the Stanford rough is gradu
ally being dragged down into the
maws of skittish fashion and eager
j merchants. Cords at a jolly-up are
j becoming as rare as Republicans who
are proud of it.
* * *
Naturally there are some who re-

' sist. But it is the sad truth" that
j most of thsee can lay claim to no
extra intellect. Milady and milord
! will wear whatever fantastic apparel
they can lay their hands on. Mi
lord; milady; miGod!
