MORE ABOUT STRIKES
The Editor, Sir:
I read in Mr. Mellinkoff's interest
ing "Bull Session" of Monday a
rather severe censure of the conduct
of the San Francisco strike.
The truth of the matter is, of
course, that Mellinkoff's personal re
actions to the strike make very little
difference. Strikes are not, either
actually or traditionally, drama lie
enterprises by which the laboring
classes hope to appeal to, or to purge
the emotions of, those whose posi
tions make them spectators.
Strikes are blind struggles against
oppressive conditions; and to urge
the point that strikes are always
more effective as threats than as
realities is only to say that at the
present time, minority — capital is
mightier than majority—labor, and
that the paradox is explicable only
in terms of class-consciousness.
And besides being quite obvious,
this analysis misses the ultimate (or
long-time) significance of strikes.
Until such a time, at least a na
tional general strike is theoretically
conceivable (when, of course, it will
be unnecessary), the "reasonable"
spectator has certainly no justifica
tion for thinking that labor will win
his immediate struggles with the
dominant class. Mr. Bridges, be as
sured, knew this. But he also knew
that the strike was an opportunity
vividly to present the class struggle
to the workers of the region, and
incidentally, to free labor from the
fetters of craft unionism.
Bridges' silence, then, must not be
construed as an admission of fail
ure. It is simply the tactful policy
nf a leader who looks to the future.
Sincerely,
Richard Lynden
