# Autumn Fashion Edition
## Roughs Bow To New Fads In Clothing Radical Changes Occur In Wearing Apparel 
### 
The once notorious Stanford rough, j
filthy but comfortable in his hickory
shirt, unshined brogues, and dirt- |
stiff cords, is a rare sight these days, i
and little wonder. Down "merchants' J
row" in Paly there are being dis- j
played such arrays of fancy pants, j
snappy jackets, and "stylish" shoes,
that a self-respecting Indian male |
hardly dares be seen in anything
but the latest styles, let alone in the
garb of old.
The worm of men's styles turns,
slowly, but still it turns. Row and
hall men are wearing those xiew ap
parels so blatantly displayed in the
many uptown men's stores. The
rough is obscure in the swirl of bi
swings, wrap arounds, shirred backs,
and side welts.
The same general style trends are
followed by most of the Paly men's
shops, but each seems to have some
distinct tricks of color and design in
their clothes all their own.
Nights are getting cold these days
in rumbles and convertables, and
overcoats are not only proper, but
necessary. The wrap-around double
breasted coat with no buttons is un
doubtedly the most popular with
college men all over the country this
year. Browns are the most widely
sold, it seems, since that color can
bo worn with an outfit of almost
any shade. Llama and angora soft
wool coats and window pane plaids
are particularly popular.
For formal wear, the full dress,
common in collegiate circles of the j
east, is coming into its own. But the ;
double-breasted tux is just as new
and far more practical.
For informal night wear the popu
lar bi-swings and sports backs are
out. Plain back, double breasted
suits in dark browns and blues are i
standard.
The most radical new changes in !
men's styles naturally come with in
formal sports and campus wear.
Some of the new items are: trench ,
coats, and rain coats, with leather j
buttons and belts all around; sports!
sweaters with shirred backs and:
back belt in greys, tans, blues, and I
maroons; leather buttoned coat
sweaters; round colored shirts with
pin stripes; button down collar j
shirts; cable stitch pullover sweat- J
ers; crc-pe-soled shoes with brown
and tan uppers; heavy wool argyle
socks in bright, checked colors;
wool, shirred back polo shirts. in
brown and blue; and many colored
sweater sets.
The most popular form of campus j
wear this fall consists of zipper j
jackets with bi-swing backs in pin !
checks and small over plaids with
side welt slacks to match. The j
jackets have almost displaced the
common leather jacket.
Hats are seldom worn, even at j
night, but when they are, they are i
usually dark brown snap brims. |
