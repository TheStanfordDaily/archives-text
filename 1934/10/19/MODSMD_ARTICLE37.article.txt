# Knitting Sweeps Campus As Favorite Recreation
## Bright Colored Yarns Most Popular; Rough Wool Widely Featured 
### 
Discouraged professors, who al
ways are worried over the inatten
tiveness of their classes, are more so
than usual this year. The reason:
numerous co-eds, not content with
drawing pictures and powdering
noses during lectures, have dis
covered a new distractionâ€”knitting.
Red seems to be the favorite color,
perhaps due to the excessive patriot
ism of the One Thousand, while
electric blue, tangerine, cinnamon
bark, and tomato are all on the pre
ferred list.
As for yarns, there is almost no
end to their variety. Nubbly yarns
continue to be popular, wool boucle
being among the smartest of the
smart.
Another type of yarn that works
up beautifully is the soft imported
kind that fuzzes up. This wool is
ideal for your twin sweater sets and
is the kind made famous by the
3rooks sweater. Yarn featuring a
hread of rayon twisted through the
wool is very new and chic.
The more experienced knitters are
making two- and three-piece suits.
As the skirts are knit on round
needles, two-piece suits are really
no more difficult to make than
sweaters.
