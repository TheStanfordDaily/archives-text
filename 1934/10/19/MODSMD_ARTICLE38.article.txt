# Maids Sport Smart Shoes

### 
The Stanford "girl about the cam- j
pus" will hide her dainty feet in i
the x'oughest, most sex-viceable of;
brogues this year. This doesn't mean
he kind of shoes your mother would
choose, for new sport shoes fairly |
scream style, and the roughness of j
the leather and the heavier con- j
struction are perfect complements'
for the new rough fabrics ixx j
drdsses.
Bucko, a calf skin tanned like j
buck, which wears better and \
withstands moisture, is one of the i
best of the new materials. Genuine
seal calf is more unusual and very •
populax-.
Pumps are still the best for dressy'
wear —but they must be opera pumps
having no bows or buckles.
For evening wear sandals are still
the most populax - , but the day of the
very-cut-out styles is passing.
Stockings are quite dark in tone,
and off-black shades are strikingly
good looking. Consider the new
knee-high hosiery seriously, for it
has lots in its favor.
Gx-andma isn't the only one who
is knitting these days. Everyone I
from sub-debs up and down the line I
are doing it.
Antoine de Paris decrees that this |
season curls on the back of the head j
must be worn high.
