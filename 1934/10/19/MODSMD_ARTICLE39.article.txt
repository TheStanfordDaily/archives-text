# Waterproof Coats Keep Co-eds Dry
## Touch of Anarctic Is Added By New Byrd Cloth 
### 
Rain clouds are already beginning
to fill the sky, warning Stanford
students to prepare for the many
stormy, and threatening days ahead
of them this quarter.
To prepare for rain, campus wo
men need not unearth all the old
clothes they never expected to wear
again. One can wear any dress under
one of the new, absolutely water
proof raincoats. Or it is possible to
get an ensemble; raincoat, hat or
bex-et, and umbx-ella to match.
Coats made of Byrd cloth are the
very newest thing this season. This
material, which contains no rubber,
is windproof as well as rainproof. It
was made especially for Admii'al
Byrd to use on his expedition in
Little America. Palo Alto stores ax-e
showing models in white Byrd cloth,
and xubberized corduroy; besides
the ever popular leather-buttoned,
gabardine trench coat. For those
who want to be prepared for sun on
a rainy day as well as rain on a
sunny day, thex-e is always the smart,
cx-avenetted tweed.
Raincoats made of helio ax*e mar
velous. They are light as a feather
and shed wafer quickly. Rubberized
silk will also be good in both light
and dark shades this season. These
silks ax'e usually belted and made
polo fashion.
In spite of all the new roads now
being built, with the rains will in
evitably come mud puddles. Tins
brings up the question as to what
feminine feet will wear plowing
across the Quad. Galoshes are much
the same this year as last. However
no colors will be worn except black,
white, and brown. They come in a
silk finish, and in a rubber processed
to look like alligator. An innovation
for the few who prefer rubbex-s is an
unlined type which fits more
smoothly than before and has greater
elasticity.
