# Split Skirts Featured In New Styles
## Wrap-Around Advocated By Authorities 
### 
Armed with their trusty scissors, i
the Paris dressmakers set to work
on their fall collection, and, 10, the
split skirt is revived. Both eve
ning and daytime skirts have gone
under the shears, with incisions
varying from a few inches to a foot
in depth.
The wrap-around dress is without
a doubt the smartest and most im
portant dress of this new fashion.
Here there is no actual split, for the
dresses are really wrapped, with
plenty of surplus material so that
there is no leg exposure.
The tunic is a persistent fashion.
Year after year it appears, and this
year it promises to be one of the
most important of fall 'fashions.
Very often these are split, creating
an extremely smart and slightly
flaring line.
The scissors have been active on
necklines of dresses with resulting
daring effects in many evening/
gowns. Schiaparelli has bravely
slashed her necklines to the limit,
and then thrust in a bit of lace or
tucked in a few flowers.
With many designers using the
split skirt as a means of bringing
ankles and legs into the evening pic
ture again, there is some feeling
that the shorter skirt may be on its
way back into fashion. These may
be the first flashes of a short skirt
to appear on the horizon, but it is
not believed that it will attain any
importance thus season.
As a general rule, the smart
woman will wear her hem-lines as
they best become her. Street and
sports wear will vary from nine to
ten inches from the floor. The ankle
length gown is gaining prominence
