# Split Skirts Featured In New Styles
## Wrap-Around Advocated By Authorities 
### 
Armed with their trusty scissors, i
the Paris dressmakers set to work
on their fall collection, and, 10, the
split skirt is revived. Both eve
ning and daytime skirts have gone
under the shears, with incisions
varying from a few inches to a foot
in depth.
The wrap-around dress is without
a doubt the smartest and most im
portant dress of this new fashion.
Here there is no actual split, for the
dresses are really wrapped, with
plenty of surplus material so that
there is no leg exposure.
The tunic is a persistent fashion.
Year after year it appears, and this
year it promises to be one of the
most important of fall 'fashions.
Very often these are split, creating
an extremely smart and slightly
flaring line.
The scissors have been active on
necklines of dresses with resulting
daring effects in many evening/
gowns. Schiaparelli has bravely
slashed her necklines to the limit,
and then thrust in a bit of lace or
tucked in a few flowers.
With many designers using the
split skirt as a means of bringing
ankles and legs into the evening pic
ture again, there is some feeling
that the shorter skirt may be on its
way back into fashion. These may
be the first flashes of a short skirt
to appear on the horizon, but it is
not believed that it will attain any
importance thus season.
As a general rule, the smart
woman will wear her hem-lines as
they best become her. Street and
sports wear will vary from nine to
ten inches from the floor. The ankle
length gown is gaining prominence
as the smart length for cocktail and
tea dresses. Evening gowns may
i trail slightly, or finish at the heels.
Many are lifted in front, giving a
I slightly irregular line, and making
; them especially comfortable for
dancing.
There has been a gradual leaning
j toward the fashion of the dolman
| sleeve, and this season finds the
dress with the deep cut, easy fitting
i arm-hole among the smartest. Its
S comfort makes it exceedingly de
\ sirable to most women. And it is
exceptionally flattering to the slen
: der women. It is used in silk dresses
| and wools. Raglan sleeves and
saddle shoulders give the same
j effect. Above all, the shoulder must
be natural.
Sleeves themselves may be quite
| straight or they may introduce full
ness which is shirred or gathered
! in at some point below the shoulder,
with the largest section occurring
j about the elbow. •
Let your fashion sense be your
guide about sleeve lengths. If you
like three-quarter lengths, wear
to your heart's content. If
! you adore the smartness of a long,
I tight sleeve, by all means wear the
dresses that sponsor them. Long
j sleeves are especially smart for din
i ner dresses, and gowns for the cock
tail hour. These long-sleeved gowns
! usually show a deep decolletage in
jfront or back.

I tight sleeve, by all means wear the

Armed with their trusty scissors, i
the Paris dressmakers set to work
on their fall collection, and, 10, the
split skirt is revived. Both eve
ning and daytime skirts have gone
under the shears, with incisions
varying from a few inches to a foot
in depth.
The wrap-around dress is without
a doubt the smartest and most im
portant dress of this new fashion.
Here there is no actual split, for the
dresses are really wrapped, with
plenty of surplus material so that
there is no leg exposure.
The tunic is a persistent fashion.
Year after year it appears, and this
year it promises to be one of the
most important of fall 'fashions.
Very often these are split, creating
an extremely smart and slightly
flaring line.
The scissors have been active on
necklines of dresses with resulting
daring effects in many evening/
gowns. Schiaparelli has bravely

importance thus season.

sports wear will vary from nine to
ten inches from the floor. The ankle
length gown is gaining prominence
as the smart length for cocktail and
tea dresses. Evening gowns may
i trail slightly, or finish at the heels.
Many are lifted in front, giving a
I slightly irregular line, and making

dancing.
There has been a gradual leaning
j toward the fashion of the dolman

dress with the deep cut, easy fitting
i arm-hole among the smartest. Its
S comfort makes it exceedingly de

exceptionally flattering to the slen

saddle shoulders give the same
j effect. Above all, the shoulder must
be natural.
