No feudal knight could boast of
such glamorous coats of mail as are
now being worn. Metal shines every
where. Whether it is for sport, after
noon or evening, almost every really
new dress must favor gold or silver
ornaments.
Conventional velvet becomes un
conventional and exciting in its high
colors, such as stratosphere blue,
purple, pinewood green, peacock
blue, and rust.
Plaids still take first honors for
sports dresses, with stripes and
checks running close second. Plaid
skirts with hai'monizing plain-col
ored jackets are especially chic.
Three - piece swagger suits with
full-length top-coats are practical,
as well as becoming, for autumn
wear.
Corduroy suits and coats are be
ing shown in all shops. These cor
duroy coats are especially attractive
when worn over bright wool and
cotton boucle suits.
