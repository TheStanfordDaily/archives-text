# SEQUINS NOW WORN WITH WOOL DRESSES
## 
### 
Sequins have crashed into popu- j
larity with such momentum that j
clever fashion designers have
shrewdly found use for them wher- 1
ever possible, in both afternoon and i
evening clothes. Strange as the com- I
bination may sound, the two have
been kept distinct. The gold and
silver sequins with their formal
glamour are reserved for evening
gowns, cocktail and dinner hats,
evening accessories, â€¢ and collars and
capelets.
But on afternoon dresses a new 1
mode of black sequins or sequins
exactly matching the frock's color i
has been perfected by the fashion j
designers, who sought a new origi- j
nality in afternoon apparel. Black 1
sequins can do as much to pep up a
black dress as lively colors, the old
standby for such a job.
It used to be that wool was re
stricted to daytime wear and sequins I
to the evening, but now the situation i
is reversed or a combination of both
may be used for cither time. Wool
evening dresses arc very fashionable, i
especially wool evening dresses with
sequins.
