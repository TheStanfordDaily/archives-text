In a cigarette it's taste, but in
over-dressing, it's waste. Even
1 hough you believe in Santy, don't
try to resemble a Xmas tree. Some
women are as sturdy as an oak,
others as ethereal as a willow, but a
Xmas tree bears no fruit. The char
acteristic simplicity of Stanford
women should be extended to the
matter of clothes.
School loyalty should not be car
ried to the extent of wearing "red
for.Stanford." Horrors! In the eyes
of ail men, women are colorful, but
don't blind them to your beauty with
something designed to arouse a Bull
Durham ad.
Something should be done about
the bloody finger-nails of these em
bryo Lady Macbeths. The country
is quite sufficiently in the red, with
women "doing their part." Why not
a new fad for painting knee-caps a
brilliant orange, with a coy fringe
of green?
Even though your size 12's may
bother you, this year's fashion taboos
the removal of shoes at campus
dances —even at jolly-ups where
practically anything goes — and
comes. We may seem to put this
strongly—but then, so do the feet.
Formals at informals are as out of
pjace as a napkin under the chin at
the Waldorf-Astoria. The gym em
ploys efficient janitors to sweep the
floors.
Similar to—and about as appro
priate as—elephant's ears are those
big, floppy chapeaux. They may be
all right for a fan on a warm evening
and as protection when the dance
gets rough, but it is extremely diffi
cult for a man to dance with a piece
of hat in his mouth.
After all, nonchalance is all you
need. If you lose your heel at a
dance, just find another fellow and
go home with him.
