# Stripes and Plain Colors Appear Good in Shirts
## 
### 
Fine striping and plain colors are
in favor this season with those whe
are smartly shirted. Greys and
brown are meeting with equal popu
larity among the single tone types
while many effective color combina
tions have made the striped shirl
adaptable to any outfit.
Another important trend in 'shirti
is the fitting of the lines to the body
The shaped waist gives the impres
sion of neatness and adds to the
height and comfort of the wearer
Shoulders and collar are being tail
ored lower in front lending t
smoother look to the neck fitting.
Collar styles have definitely sei
themselves toward rounded or but
toned points. The rounded type
must be worn with a clasp to ap
pear smart; the , button type has
been with us before and promises tc
regain its previous leadership.
