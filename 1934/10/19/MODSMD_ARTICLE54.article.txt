# Coats Stick to Straight and Narrow
## Materials Go Giddy As Styles Become Severe Fitted Waistline Returns; Swaggers Hold Favor For Campus Wear 
### 
New coat styles are cutting capers
on the campus this month. The col
lege woman knows that the coat is
one of the most important articles in
her wardrobe because she wears it
oftener and longer than any dress.
Therefore it is tremendously impor
tant that whatever she buys be ab
solutely right!
Coats are slim this season. They
define waistlines and make one al
most hipless.
The trend in dress coats, appro
priate for a rush tea-or trip to the
city, is the collar ripple. This style
came in with the spring, but was
far too flattering to go out with that
season.
Sleeves this year are minus all the
tricks and truffles of 1934. If there
is fullness it is seen at the elbow, and
consists of a series of small darts or
tucks.
Sport coats this year were designed
for the college girl who likes to
swing her arms at football games.
Men claim the popular action back
was stolen from their bi-swing sport
jackets, while loyal feminists con
test that it is only a new version of
the old-time norfolk.
Tweeds are extremely smart this
year, as well as Scottish plaids.
