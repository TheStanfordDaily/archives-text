# Smart Accessories Held Vital for Fall Ensembles
## 
### 
The inevitable something that
spells chic comes from the "little
things" in dress: interesting hand- j
bags, flattering gloves, colorful scarfs j
—these are the things that make or 1
mar the effect of new fall outfits.
There is something about a hand- j
bag that is like a young boy's pocket: 1
they both have so much in them, j
And the new fall bags can "take it." !
They are outfitted with a separate !
coin purse and a purse for bills. !
Many have extra pockets for lip- j
stick, compact, and and all j
of them have an extra pouch some- |
times closed by a zipper for papers, j
notes, and cards. Grained leather is j
the new thing. It wears well and j
looks well. In other words, the :
dream of having a serviceable bag j
that can be orderly and not bulky \
may be realized.
Velvet and smooth crepe are be- j
ing made up into evening bags, but j
lame is really newest if it suits the j
costume. Jeweled clasps make these
bags more formal than ever
Then this matter of gloves! There j
is a four-button classic—it is worn j
with sport clothes or with dressier I
things. Another popular model this j
year is the one-button glove—a take- I
off from what the kid sister in gram
mar school wears. It's comfortable,

slips on easily, and is just the thing
for a rough tweed suit, or a sweater
and skirt outfit. Pigskin or glace
l;id make them wearable, a? well as
washable.
The wide cuff is good, especially if
the cuffs fit over the sleeves of the
dress. Most cuffs have n stitched
design of checks, row on row of
small designs, or plain circular
stitching.
For years clever women have been
buying long gloves and pushing them
down around the wrist in small
creases giving a casual and flattering
effect. The result is that a long
glove stitched into tucks and creases
is on the market. This glove has the
distinction of having been originated
by Schiaparelli.
Another one of the "little things"
this season in reference to spores
clothes is the triangular scarf that
ties around the neck and resembles
a descendant of the bib. Bright and
contrast colors are the only rules
of this latest version of the triangle
a bright orange on a dull green or
rust-colored sport dress, a gay yel
low shot with dark lines on a navy
blue outfit, or a cherry red on eel
grayl' v These gay bits of color touch
up a sweater and skirt outfit or
sports suit and add a variety of color
to dress.
