# Inter-Club Council, Halls Give Big Dance Tonight
## 
### 
i An inter-club dance will be held
on the campus this evening at 9
o'clock, for the first time in the
j history of Stanford. The dance is
being given at Toyon and Branner
to the melody of A1 Rush ton and his
j Royal Cardinal orchestra.
A very large crowd is expected by
; the dance committee, who have ar
ranged to use both Branner and
Toyon halls and Branner dining
I room. The Cardinals' music will be
carried throughout the three units
by a public address system.
The decorations are in charge of
Milo Tally, who is well known for
! his good work at last year's Encina
Formal, and previous Toyon dances.

1 Tally and his committee have long
[ been at work on the completion of
! their elaborate plans.
This is the first time the Stanford
I clubs have combined their efforts
1 toward the success of one represent-
I ative dance. Instead of rivaling each
other, the men's organizations have
j decided to co-operate in the back
to-the-farm movement for better
dances, and to acquaint new men
with the former campus hall resi
j dents.
The fall informal, stated Chairman
Bill Coughlan, is being sponsored by
the Inter-Club Council, which is
i composed of two members from each
| hall and eating club on the campus.
