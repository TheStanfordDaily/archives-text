# SUITS GO MANNISH: USE BRIGHT COLORS
## 
### 
Too much beloved to be deserted,
suits have popped out on the campus
more prominently than ever this ;
fall. The most popular campus suit'
depends on the bi-swing back, i
mannishly tailored type of jacket
with a plain or gay plaid skirt.
For that broad-shouldered, "slim- 1
below" effect, a daringly colored i
jacket with a simple, dark skirt is i
effective. For afternoon and in- j
formal dressy wear, suits are in- j
dispensable. Satin and lame rival I
taffeta with colors that are different,
while white is always good.
Sophisticated yellowish - greens,
cloudy light blues, or soft rust shades
add a novel touch. The simpler the j
lines of the suit, the more dramatic
should be the blouse.
