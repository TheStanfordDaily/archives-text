### 
Obviously feathers are being worn
this season, though not the waving
plumes of the recent pseudo-Eugenie
era, as may be noticed by glancing
over the women's rooting section.
Instead they are very refined feath
ers, posed in front or back, or on
the side to accent the profile.
Flirtatious little affairs that they
are, of curled ostrich tips, the
hats they trim fill in the gap between
the strictly tailored hat and the quite
formal dinner type.
New hose display dark shades for
all occasions.
