by a flame-colored sash reaching to
the floor on one side; sandals of the
same hue will complete the outfit.
An especially striking ensemble
will be worn by Peggy Place. It
features a flared tunic and skirt slit
below the knee, which is the sea
son's latest style. The neck is square
and the decolletage back is also cut
square. She will wear gold slippers
and accessories with her gown.
