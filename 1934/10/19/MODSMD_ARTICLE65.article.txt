# White Shorts Lead Field For Best Tennis Garb
## 
### 
Shorts on the tennis court are
sensible as well as stylish. And the
shorter they are, the more sensible
and the more stylish.
For the real tennis player, the girl
who wants her outfit to combine
correctness of costume and custom,
white is the color of the court.
Brilliance may be introduced in
the headband or in the sweater
which is worn to and from the field
of battle. Helen Wills Moody re
marks in "Tennis" that a player has
often been upset by a brightly-clad
player running about on a near-by
c6urt.
