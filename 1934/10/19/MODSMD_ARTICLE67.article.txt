# CAN YOU FACE IT?

Summer complexions have begun
[ to wane along with summer's loves,
j and we all admit that the tans which
! cost us so many hours of broiling to
acquire, are not so ravishing be
' neath October's moon. How to get
your skins, as well your school spirit
and studious brains, back into condi
tion? The fellows are all in training
for sports, why not join them and
keep the same rules.
Now to undo the ravages of sun
and wind and nightly indulgence in
these devastating spreads. As the
season of indoor heat begins, and
our complexions get less sun and
air, our skin stimulation becomes
increasingly important. Later in the
winter you'll have to combat chap
ping and excess dryness, but right
now the problem is to make the
circulation race to the hungry cells.
Lately there has been a revival of
interest in complexion brushes. A
gentle daily massage with a fine
bristle brush and mild facial soap
does more to dispel signs of oiline&s
skin sluggishness than any
other treatment. An ideal time for
campus women to do this is before
retiring. Then apply a thin film of
your favorite facial cream and pat
it in, leaving just enough on to help
melt away the layers of dry, parched
skin, and refine the conspicuous
pores. Next morning, after cleans
ing, dampen a bit of cotton with J
[ skin freshener and remove the ex
cess cream.
Shine Eliminated
Now for the daytime make-up.
This should be applied very tho- i
roughly, because after all, one does [
have to keep from shining till 12
o'clock noon. This matter of per- |
sonal daintiness and keeping that
well-groomed look is a problem, but
no one need worry if a good job is I
done before the mirror. For school, |
apply a natural shade of rouge, as j
it blends with almost every shade j
in quad clothes. And don't forget 1
to be careful these dark mornings j
when making up under an electric
light. But blend your rouge in evenly
and use just a little. A bit of mas
cara in the mornings widens those j
sleepy looking eyes, but it must be j
ihe correct shade for your coloring, j
Brown is good for blondes, and black
for most everyone else. No eye- 1
shadow for daytime, but if the sun t
has bleached the tips of your eye- I
lashes, a touch of grower or vase- !
line v/ill do the trick and also give |
a sparkle to the eye.

Take a look at the lips around
your 10 o'clock classroom some
morning. Aren't they nearly ready
for a new application of lipstick?
Well, if you will just flip your
powder puff over your lips and then
moisten them, they will stay just
as fresh and dewy as when you
first applied the rouge. With a final
whisk of the clothes brush, you are
on the way to meet the 8 o'clock.
Use Pre-Dinncr Hour
The hour before dinner when
everyone just fools around is a good
time to pick up loose ends. Shoes
always need cleaning or polishing,
and clothes need pressing. The hair
brush is right there on your bureau,
and how much smoother and neater
everyone's hair looks after a few
vigorous, shining strokes. Nails, too,
can be shaped and brushed, or even a
bit of oil applied to the cuticle does
wonders to keep them looking cul
tured and refined.
Was that your buzzer? A date to
the City? And not too long to dress,
either! Now the nails are fixed and
the formal is pressed, so the process
of dressing can be leisurely and
without flurry. Lie down for 10 or
15 minutes with little pads of cotton
moist with witch hazel over your
eyes, and just relax. Of course
cleansing, being the first step in
every make-up, is thorough. Eyes
are the center of interest at night,
so play up to them. They should be
shining and rested after their few
minutes' relaxation. Have you seen
the clever new gadgets which curl
and flatter eyelashes? It is exciting
to see one's eyes transformed when
mascara is applied to curled-up
lashes.
And another hint — draw out
the corners of the eyes with an
eyebrow pencil to give them that
slightly elongated appearance which
is so mysterious. A touch of eye
shadow on the outer edge of the

I and much larger. Brush away all
| traces of surplus powder after the)
make-up is complete and, especially,
be sure to brush eyebrows carefully j
to remove powder and bring unruly
brows into shape. The same little
trick of powdering over your lip
j stick helps to keep lips perfect all
I evening. And, of course, you touched |
; the tips of your ears and curls with :
, your most glamorous perfume be-1
I fore you started dressing so a per- |
j fume bottle can't even be suggested.'
The simplest beauty care is the j
! most effective, if it is pursued con
scientiously. And now there isn't l
■ one of you who cannot face Octo-
I ber's big full moon, without looking
! most alluring. 1
