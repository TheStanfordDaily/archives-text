# WOOL FABRICS MOST POPULAR
## Metal-Shot Silks Viewed In Paris Openings 
### 
Pulling the wool over your eyes,
; that's the specialty of these new |
women, and what is more, the Stan- j
j ford rough seems to like it.
It is the stunning wool sport
clothes they have been wearing on
Quad that has done the trick, and
the vivid colors and smart fabrics
have added a new touch of bright
[ ness to the drab sandstone arches, j
For woolens are ace - high this
; year, taking precedence over all
1 fabrics but "cloth of gold." Nor are
they limited to the sport section of
the wardrobe, as dressy wool crepes
and wool and silk mixtures are seen
i at almost every social function, and
even on the dance floor.
Wool alpaca, having played a re
i turn engagement last summer, is be-
I ing encored this season. Unlike the
alpaca of our grandmother's day,
! this fabric is no longer shiny and
J harsh but has a pebbly, crepey ap
pearance and is neither hard nor i
i glossy.
Monotone woolens are smartest
I when they feature the relief effect. J
! Ribs are of two varieties: very flat,
I so that it is difficult to distinguish
I them at all, and those that are heav
ily corded. Waffle checks are also
i a distinctive note in monotones.
But we must not neglect the silks
j in our enthusiasm, for they too are
j in the fashion picture, especially
| lame and metal-shot silks. Featured
! in the Paris openings, metal cloth for |
j evening wear has taken the coun
try by storm. The lame evening I
j gown and wrap is being worn to all
J formal functions and is a favorite
j ensemble of the smart woman.
Lame blouses, too, look important !
j this season. With suits of all kinds
| so popular, the dressy suit has come
j in for its share of popularity, and i
; the lame blouse is just the thing
with this type of ensemble.
