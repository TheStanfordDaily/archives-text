"Whut the well dressed Stanford
woman will wear" is a question,
true, but what is being worn by the
well dressed Stanford woman is the
story.
We give first place to red and grey,
Jeanne Keesling appeared this week
in a greyish tweed suit peppered
with red. A red blouse and scarf are
trimmed with fringe of the suit ma
terial giving the suit a very finished
look.
Juliette Proctor is seen dashing
about in grey with red suede ties on
the inner sweater of a twin set and
a red and black suede belt on the
outer one.

Marylee Harlan adds a bright red
beret type hat to her attractive two
piece suit of grey with a shadow
plaid effect in red.
Red was also effectively combined
with blue by Nancy Pettigrew in a
lipstick red twin sweater set and an
electric blue skirt and scarf.
If not red it still must be bright ap
parently, as evidenced by the great
amount of orange and yellow.
Jane Leighton startles the campus
with brilliant orange accessories and
scarf worn under a choir-boy jacket
of brown velveteen.
Other startling and clever combi
nations noted in the autumn styles
as modeled by Stanford women are:
a grey suit with brown accessories
and a brown silk blouse, worn by
Louise Alauzet, and Alice Philip
sports a brown and yellow checked
skirt and scarf with an Eaton jacket
on cooler days.
