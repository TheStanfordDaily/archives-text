# Button Trimmed Gloves Have Tailored Smartness
## 
### 
All the new gloves deserve a hand [
this fall! It is hard to say that one I
glove is smarter than the other, :
because in this season when there j
are so many good ones, and so many |
clever novelties, it is all a matter of
taste.
The four-button slip-on glove will
be among the most popular. These
are classic, and look well when worn j
with either tailored or dressy [
clothes. The slip-on with a slight !
flare is also to be much in demand. I
This type of glove is especially smart
if the flare is wide enough to allow i
it to be worn over the sleeve.
Sheer beauty - hosiery comes in j
Firefly, Russet, Titian, Peach Tan, i
and Toupe. Attractively priced.
