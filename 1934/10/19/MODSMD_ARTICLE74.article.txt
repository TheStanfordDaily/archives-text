Although the old Stanford rough ]
is fast becoming a myth and his ,
| brother under the skin, the new
! "smoothie," takes the center of the
I stage, still the degeneration has not
reached the point of assorted head
, gear for the Stanford man.
The rule is "no hats" for "no
where" and an infringement upon
' this prerogative, particularly in the
! case of dressy hats, is more likely to
! call forth a barrage of waving hand
kerchiefs than looks of approval.
According to the latest and best

there are times for everything, there
are also times for the proverbial

There have been a few hats of
various hues bobbing about over the
campus, but there is as yet no ap
parent concerted effort either upon
the part of the rough or the "smoo
thie" to make hats the rule rather
than the exception.
The rough has reached his last
trench. If hats go in, then he goes
out.
