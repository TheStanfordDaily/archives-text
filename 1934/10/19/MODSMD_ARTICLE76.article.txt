# Variety of Tunic Styles Lend to Distinctiveness
## 
### 
If you have been planning your |
new season wardrobe, in all proba- j
bility you have decided upon a :
tunic. But, you ask, what sort of a j
tunic? Will it be long or short, fitted (
or flared, with or without a belt?
!
Try on the different versions of j
this interesting fashion. Notice which i
ones become you most, and which ;
meet your requirements.
There is such latitude in this new
fashion that if one wished, from it
could be constituted an entire ward- j
i robe. And, happily, since there are i
no hard and fast restrictions on this !
winning silhouette, such a wardrobe
would not even seem to show repe- I
1 tition.
The mobile tunic is subject to as ;
many variations as there are waist
lines, necklines, sleeve lengths, col
ors, and fabrics. Your choice may be
! a suit, a two-piece frock which
looks like a suit, a neat little campus
I dress, an important afternoon frock,
I a fluid evening gown, or perhaps a
stiff-silk formal.
Although this new mdde is a uni
versal fashion, it is not a "uniform"
fashion. The styles are so very much
individualized you need not hesitate
about a tunic because of the belief ;
that you will meet yourself at every
corner. Present day style trends are
1 very far from those of a few years
was nearly the exact replica of every
other American woman. Those were j

the days when everybody wore
Chanel's little-girl collars, or tai
lored suits with scarfs.
