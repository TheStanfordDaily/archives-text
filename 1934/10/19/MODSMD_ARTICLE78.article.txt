# STANFORD TENNIS APPAREL RETAINS ANTI-NUDE TREND
## 
### 
Tendencies throughout the world
toward semi-nudity in sports clothes
stop at the gates to the Farm's tennis
courts, if the Stanford man desires
to serve his "aces" in appropriate
attire.
Toleration of men without even
the semblance of proper attire (not
necessarily appropriate attire) can
only be justified where semi-nudity
is the exhibition of some extraordi
nary physique, not a sigh of untidi
ness, according to the dictates of
taste and smart style as backed by
University authorities who sanction
dress on the Stanford courts.
Modified to suit the fall weather,
costumes for men are the most
stylish which retain white flannel or
palm beach pants of the long variety,
the short-sleeved, open-necked shirt
with well defined collar, and the
sport coat. The coat may be of col
ored tweed, or be displaced entirely
by a top coat sweater, preferably of
white. Good taste, thought by cam
pus authorities to be the criteria of
smart style, demands the full cos
tume on the University courts.
