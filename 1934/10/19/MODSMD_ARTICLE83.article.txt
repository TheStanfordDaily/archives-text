# CARDS MUST SAVE FOR TROJAN GAME
## 
### 
The Cardinals, with the U.S.C.
game coming up next week, will take
U.S.F. as just another team on the
schedule. The cripples and par
tial-cripples will be used only
slightly, even if they are needed for
victory, because Coach Tiny Thorn
hill cannot afford to take too big a
chance on their being re-hurt.
The Dons will throw their entire
bag of tricks at Stanford; the Indians
will not retaliate, since a few sur
prises must be concealed from Tro
jan scouts who will be in attendance.
If U.S.F. failed to win another
game all year, her season would be
considered successful should she be
the only team on the Coast to whip
Stanford, Rose Bowl participant lust
January. So the San Francisco club
has no reason for holding anything
back.
