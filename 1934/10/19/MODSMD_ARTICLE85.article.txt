# DROFNATS IN COMA, MUMBLES "DARKEST BEFORE DON," BUT PICKS CARDS TO WIN
## 
### 
"Don do it again," pleaded Syl
vestre J. Drofnats as he pulled him
self out of a drunken stupoi\ cele
bration for almost picking the score
last week, in time to clutter up the
Daily office( or dippy shack) just at 1
the busiest moment in the entire
day yesterday.
Tlie moaning vaguely referred to
Sylvestre J.'s fear that the Dons :
would drive Stanford's Indians crazy
again this year, and he backed up
his silly assertion by firmly affirming I
the Cards would sneak through on a
last minute guard-around-lateral lo
muke the score 7 to 6, Stanford.
Drofnats further demeaned his
slinking self by admitting that he
likes California, U.S.C., and St. 1

following things would happen, so
what could we do?
California 13, U.C.L.A. 0 (mama
spank).
