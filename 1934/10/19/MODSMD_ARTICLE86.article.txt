# Water Poloists Meet Uclan Today
## CARD, BRUIN TANK MEN OPEN COAST CONFERENCE PLAY 
### Roger Kimball 
Having started play in one league
with their 7 to 0 yictory over Lake
side Wednesday night, the Indian
varsity water polo team will play its
first game in the other circuit when
it clashes with U.C.L.A. in Encina
pools at 4:15 o'clock today.
The Lakeside game was part of the
Northern California Water Polo
League schedule, but this afternoon's
tilt with tVie powerful Uclans will
be a Pacific Coast Conference affair.
Co-champions of the league and un
defeated in their last 15 conference
games, the Stanford seven runs grave
danger against an improved Bruin
outfit.
1934 Games Close
Last year, the Cards defeated the
Uclans in two hard-fought, low
score games by one-goal margins,
and the southerners are out for re
venge. They are also anxious to
spoil Stanford's record, which in
cludes .supremacy over other coast
colleges for 21 of the past 22 years.
Another incentive to the visitors is
the fact that they have never con
quered Stanford in the tough water
sport.
It would not be surprising to see
a repetition of events of last sea
son, when several members of both
teams were thrown out of the
Cardinal-Bruin games for unneces
sary roughness. The referee blew
his whistle for fours constantly in
the Lakeside struggle.
Systems Contrasted
The U.C.L.A. system of attack,
which is American, will contrast
with that of Stanford, which is an
American-Hungarian mixture. This
is the first year that the Indians
have departed from the purely
Hungarian style of sudden long
passes. The Bruins' American sys
tem consists of shorter passes and is
a little smoother, although less
spectacular,
Two U.C.L.A. stars are Bobby
Sellers, forward, and Knox, an all-
Coast guard. Stanford will rely on
its great forward wall composed of
Vlad Taranik at sprint, and Captain
Leo Cook and Bill Clemo at for
wards. Wally Wiget, Bill Woodard,
and Jim Benet will handle the guard
posts, with Bob Haslacher as goalie*
Admission will be free to students,
including both the varsity game and
the preliminary at 3:30 o'clock be
tween the Card frosh and Palo Alto
High School, which finds the preps
favored to win.

and the southerners are out for re
venge. They are also anxious to
spoil Stanford's record, which in
cludes .supremacy over other coast
colleges for 21 of the past 22 years.
Another incentive to the visitors is
the fact that they have never con
quered Stanford in the tough water
sport.
It would not be surprising to see
a repetition of events of last sea
son, when several members of both
teams were thrown out of the
Cardinal-Bruin games for unneces
sary roughness. The referee blew
his whistle for fours constantly in
the Lakeside struggle.
Systems Contrasted
The U.C.L.A. system of attack,
which is American, will contrast
with that of Stanford, which is an
American-Hungarian mixture. This
is the first year that the Indians
have departed from the purely
Hungarian style of sudden long
passes. The Bruins' American sys
tem consists of shorter passes and is
a little smoother, although less
spectacular,
Two U.C.L.A. stars are Bobby
Sellers, forward, and Knox, an all-
Coast guard. Stanford will rely on
its great forward wall composed of
Vlad Taranik at sprint, and Captain
Leo Cook and Bill Clemo at for
wards. Wally Wiget, Bill Woodard,
and Jim Benet will handle the guard
posts, with Bob Haslacher as goalie*
Admission will be free to students,
including both the varsity game and
the preliminary at 3:30 o'clock be
tween the Card frosh and Palo Alto
High School, which finds the preps
favored to win.
Having started play in one league
with their 7 to 0 yictory over Lake
side Wednesday night, the Indian
varsity water polo team will play its
first game in the other circuit when
it clashes with U.C.L.A. in Encina
pools at 4:15 o'clock today.
The Lakeside game was part of the
Northern California Water Polo
League schedule, but this afternoon's
tilt with tVie powerful Uclans will
be a Pacific Coast Conference affair.
Co-champions of the league and un
defeated in their last 15 conference
games, the Stanford seven runs grave
danger against an improved Bruin
outfit.
1934 Games Close
Last year, the Cards defeated the
Uclans in two hard-fought, low
score games by one-goal margins,
and the southerners are out for re
venge. They are also anxious to
