# FROSH GRIDMEN WILL PLAY J.C.
## 
### 
Comparative strengths of the Stan
ford and Cal frosh will be available
St-turdc/y afternoon after the Pa
pooses take on San Mateo J.C. at
the Burlingame High School field.
Clint Evans' frosh at U.C. trimmed
the Jaysee eleven 33-0 two weeks
i ago.
A frosh eleven will go on the field
fit as a fiddle, with no injuries mar
ring the ranks. With the single
: omission of Jimmy Coffis at half
, back, Coach Bradshaw will start his
: strongest eleven. His line: Stone
and Dakan, ends; Oberg and Hen
-1 ningson, tackles; Holridge and Ken
ney, guards, and Heath, center. His
backficld: Roberts, quarter; Collins
, £ nd Lxickett, halves, and Paulman or
Hamilton, full.
Jim Coffis, whose flashy safety
play in punt run-backs and light
ning line thrusts make him an A-l
offensive threat, will not start, but
i will undoubtedly see action. Doc
Luckett and Glenn Hamilton have
moved up a bit this week, with
promising play in scrimmages.
San Mateo is not the weak team
the 33-0 beating at Berkeley would
indicate. Four of the five touch
downs were scored from beyond the
20-yard line, as a result of inter
cepted passes, blocked kicks, and
i long runs.
Wally oKndrative and Bud O'Neill
are the big threats in the backfield
for San Mateo, the former usually
credited as the equal of Jim Carlyon,
ex-Matean now no the Bear varsity.
It is entirely possible that if the
jaysees are "hot" the frosh will be
in for an eventful afternoon.
