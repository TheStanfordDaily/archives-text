# MUSICAL, DANCE DIRECTORS FOR GAIETIES NAMED
## Gordon Heche, H. Beaudoin Selected as Heads Of Big Game Skits TO LESSEN FRICTION Simpler Form of Direction Will Be Utilized 
### 
One of the best organized "Big
Game Gaieties" in many years was
piedicted by Dick Frank, dramatics
manager, last night, when he an
nounced the selection of Gordon
Heche and H. M. Beaudoin as mu
sical and dance directors, respec
tively.
In former productions of the
Gaieties, there have been numer
ous department heads working
together, but this year the new
music director will become the
acting, head of all these depart
ments, thereby eliminating the
friction and confusion character
istic of former systems.
Mr. Heche has been actively en
gaged in dance orchestra work for
the last ten years. Not only has he
been the master of ceremonies at
Russian River for two seasons, and a
noted- pianist in concert orchestras,
but he has actually been instru
mental in producing the Gaieties for
the past three years.
Deadline Friday
Whereas former directors have
engaged a whole orchestra, Heche
now plans to select ten of the best
musicians attainable. He will re
hearse and direct the orchestra, and
be present at all chorus rehearsals,
and other acts requiring musical ac
companiment.
The deadline for submitting all
musical scores to Heche or Dick
Frank in the Old Union is Friday,
October 2(i.
H. M. Beaudoin, the new dance
director, a U.C. man, was formerly
with Fanchon and Marco. For the
past several years he has been active
in Palo Alto, where he conducts a
dancing school and directs amateur
theatrical work. His production at
the Community Theater last year
will be remembered as bringing
much favorable comment.
Brown, Kilby Aid
Mr. Beaudoin is being unofficially
aided in his work by two Stanford
students, Phil Brown and Harriet
Hall Kilby, who have formerly aided
in producing the Gaieties.-
All women wishing to try out for
the chorus are asked to report at the
