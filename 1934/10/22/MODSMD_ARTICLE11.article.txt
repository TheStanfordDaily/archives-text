Dan C. Wooley, 72, former chief of police of Pittsburgh, Calif., now
employed as a process server as a resident of Berkeley, told Dr. It. E.
Cornish, Berkeley dog reviver, he would permit the U.C. scientist to
use him in rescuscitation experiments, but Dr. Cornish refused, saying
it would be murder should the experiments fail.
