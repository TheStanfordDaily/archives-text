## W. A. Cooper Discusses Recent Trip Abroad 
### 
"July in Germany," topic of the
Stanford Hour broadcast, will be
given over Station KGO tonight at 8
o'clock by Dr. W. A. Cooper, pro
fessor emeritus of German, instead
of at 7:45 o'clock.
A member of the Carl Schurz Tour
which sailed from New York on the
Bremen July 1 and left Hamburg for
the return voyage on the New York
August 9, Dr. Cooper will report on
impressions formed during his
month's .stay in Germany.
Courtesy Returned
The party was composed of 51
invited guests of the Carl Schurz
Association, the German Academic
Exchange Service, and the Ameri
can Institute, all of Berlin. Univer
sity and college professors, students,
and administrative officers made up
the group.
"We were invited," states Dr.
Cooper, "as a return courtesy for the
large amount of hospitality extended
to visiting German scholars, stu
dents, and men of affairs, by Amer
ican university circles, since the
war."
Fear Civil War
A crisis, unforeseen when the tour
was first projected, came to a head
the very day members of the tour
were to board the Bremen when
the afternoon papers brought out
first reports of the "purging" of June
30. Friends throughout the country
urged the group to turn around and
go home, instead of endangering
their lives in Germany. Dr. Cooper
says these were symptoms of emo
tional instability brought about by
continued journalistic lashing of the
public's nerves with tales of horror.
Two of the greatest fears of the
Germans are civil war and Bolshe
vism, according to Dr. Cooper. It
was the opinion of many residents
of Germany that civil war was nar
rowly averted by the prompt exe
cutions of June 30.
Time Changed
Dr. Cooper will discuss and in
terpret the various phases of the
political revolution in Germany, also
describing interesting visits he made
lo (he Polish Corridor and the Saar
Basin and to old cities of cultural
interest. He will tell, of enjoyable
social functions given in honor of
members of the tour.
The Stanford Hour will be broad
cast at 8 o'clock instead of 7:45 for
the next four weeks, the National
Broadcasting Company announced
yesterday, beginning with tonight's
lecture. The regular hour will be
resumed" over KGO November 19.
