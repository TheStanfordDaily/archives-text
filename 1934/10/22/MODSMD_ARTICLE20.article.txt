# Dowrie Tells Of Inflation
## 
### 
Professor George Dowrie, of the
Graduate School of Business, spoke
before the Commonwealth Club in
San Francisco Friday. His topic was
"Inflation."
As an expert in finance, Dowrie's
remarks upon present economic
conditions, which were broadcast
from the Commonwealth Club, hov
ered between being keenly analytical
and slightly cynical.
Citing three reasons for the slow
recovery in this country, Professor
Dowrie explained the first as being
the fact that "In the past, man
trusted to mother nature. In the last
depression, social unrest and po
litical instability were so marked in
the world that man couldn't do the
same thing. Because we are novices,
we have made some costly blunders
along with sonic wise measures."
Two other chief reasons for the
slow recovery in this country were
blamed by Dowrie upon the rapid
changes of the monetary system and
the state of public finance. Huge
sums were expended for direct re
lief, and countless millions loaned by
the government.
