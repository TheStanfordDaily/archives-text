"There's nuttin'quite like success
to elevate a guy," drooled Sylvestre
J. Drofnats late last night (or early
this morning) as he dropped in after
having rather poor success hitch
hiking back from the city, where he
watched Stanford beat the Dons by
just what he predicted, a 3 to 0 scorc.
The philosophical crack was a
very poor veil for Drofnats' boast
ful nature, and he went on to tell
the editor and everyone else who
wasn't busy just how he went about
picking California, St. Mary's, Card
and Bear frosh, Oregon, Notre Dame,
Chicago, Navy, and Yale to win ball
games.
Sylvestre even had the nerve to
arouse the managing editor from a
sound sleep to explain how he fig
ured U.S.C. would beat Oregon (the
game ended in a tie), and how the
Pittsburgh-Minnesota and Georgia
Tech-Michigan tilts would be dead
locked (Minnesota and Michigan
each won).
During the whole round of mod
est boasting no mention was made of
the Wisconsin-Purdue or lowa
lowa State games.
Off-campus women will meet to
day in the Women's Clubhouse at
12:30 o'clock.
