# Willis to Go Before Bay Span Group
## Argument with Lawson Brought to Head 
### 
Continuing the controversy over
the safety of the south pier founda
tion of the Golden Gate bridge, Dr.
Bailey Willis, emeritus professor of
geology, and Professor Andrew C.
Lawson of the University of Cali
fornia, who is consulting geologist
for the bridge, will appear before
the building committee of the bridge
today.
Willis Testifies
The meeting is a continuation of
that held on September 28, at which
Francis V. Keesling, chairman of the
committee, cross-examined Dr. Wil
lis as to his motives in protesting
the present plans for the bridge,
there apparently being some suspi
cion on the part of the bridge direc
tors that he was employed by some
interests inimical to the bridge, which
Dr. Willis states is not the fact.
In the hearing today, Dr. Willis
will endeavor to present to the build
ing committee the geological evi
dence for the insecurity of the
foundations unless they be sunk be
yond the possibilities of a slide.
Public To Dccidc
Also at this meeting Dr. Willis will
invite Professor Lawson to join him
in asking for the appointment of an
impartial federal commission to in
vestigate the site of the pier.
"It is my opinion, however," stated
Dr. Willis, "that the decision will
rest with the public, since only fail
ure to sell the bridge bonds appears
to be likely to force those who are
most interested in building the
bridge according to present plans to
appeal to a federal commission."
