# Alustiza Stars While Cards Beat Dons, 3-0, In Hard- fought Game
## Card Followers Relieved When Moscrip's Field Goal In Final Minute Climaxes 70-Yard Drive; Indian Line Outcharged by Dons 
### MILLARD BROWNE 
A fortnight ago, they were all fearing Grayson.
Last week at this time, U.S.C. ct al were wondering what they would do
about Grayson and Hamilton.
Now they must worry about Grayson, Hamilton, and Alustiza.
And three men will be hard for any team to bottle up.

It was pretty much Frankic Alus
tiza Day in Kezar Stadium Satur
day as the Stanford Indians looked
entirely unimpressive over three
quarters only to blossom forth with
a sustained 70-yard drive which
culminated in a three-point field goal
for Stanford.
So it was a direct result of Monk
Moscrip's place-kicking abilities
that gave the Cardinals a II to 0
decision over San Francisco's Dons
in a slow, hut entirely too close,
1 non-conference football game. But
it was indirectly a result of Alus
tiza's offensive starring which al
-1 lowed the Indians to advance witli
| in kicking distance.
U.S.F. was completely successful
ir» two little missions—those of bot-
I tling up Bobby Grayson and Bones

Hamilton. So the appearance of an
other star in Stanford's ball-carry
ing constellation was necessary if
Tiny Thornhill's men were to think
seriously of gaining any yardage.
Alustiza Brilliant
Alustiza, the "Owl-Eyed Basque,"
was one of the few bright spots in
an otherwise disappointing Cardinal
appearance which for three quarters
saw the Dons complete equals of
Stanford's touted eleven, and which
saw a Stanford line outcharged and
Cardinal backs stopped time after
time for losses.
All through the game, the Cardi
nals gave the impression of having
that scoring drive in them; but they
showed no interest in letting it out
until it seemed essential for victory.
And even then it was a question
whether time would permit a score.
Scoring threats were completely
absent during the course of the game.
On one occasion Stanford advanced
to the 26-yard line and Moscrip made
a futile field goal attempt from a
difficult angle. Once a bit earlier
the Cardinals bxought the ball to the
Don 20-yard stripe, but it was taken
here on downs. Then as the game
ended, San Francisco fumbled on her
20-yard line and Stanford recov
ered.
Punting Contest
But aside from these three occa
sions and the one Cardinal three
point drive, the entire game was
played between the respective 30-
yard lines.
The quick kicking of Alustiza con
stantly put San Francisco in a hole
during the first half. Once the ball
was grounded on the 10-yard line,
and a minute later another punt
went out of bounds on the Don four
yard ribbon. Alustiza's punting av
erage was 45.3 yards, as compared
with a Don 38-yard mean.
Although free from goal threats,
the third quarter belonged entirely
to San Francisco. During this pe
riod the Cards lost 14 yards on
running plays, and they gained
but four yards through the stub
born Dons.
Stanford opened the drive that
proved so fatal to San Francisco
