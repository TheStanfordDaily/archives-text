# The 						Man with the Key; Ask Your Janitor
## 
### 
From the streets of San Francisco and other
habitats of irresponsible men, the company
responsible for the maintenance of Stanford's
buildings plucks a large proportion of its
janitori.il force, entrusts them with room keys
and turns them loose to wander willy-nilly
through the corridors of Kncina, Tovon, Bra-n
-ner, ami Sequoia.
There is not a great deal off theft on the
part of janitors. Indeed, under the circum
stances, it is surprising that there is not more
Nevertheless, there is always a foreboding in
the mind of the average student when he goes
away in the morning leaving all his personal
belongings in the custody of a total stranger.
This is a fear that need not exist if a little
more care were used in the employing of the
janitors.
The Daily lias no intention of making a
blanket indictment of Stanford's janitors.
The majority of them are scrupulously honest
and would resent any inference to the con
trary. They are the ones, along with the stu
dents. who suffer from a dishonest minority.
In Palo Alto and vicinity there are respon
sible men, many of them with families, who
are in need of work. Some of them Work at
Stanford as janitors but under a great dis
advantage. Employees of the maintenance
company are paid a small salary and their
room and board. Those who live at their own
homes receive the small salary. The company
pockets the amount it saves on room and
hoard.
The obvious result of such a system is to
discourage married or settled men from work
ing here. Transients and irresponsibles, by
the law of averages, are more likely to hold
the jobs. Before students have a chance to
become acquainted with and gain confidence
in a janitor he is gone or is transferred to a
new station.
The faults of such a system can be easily
remedied. Responsible men can and should
be secured for these positions. The present
method, in effect, discriminates against them.
It should be changed.
