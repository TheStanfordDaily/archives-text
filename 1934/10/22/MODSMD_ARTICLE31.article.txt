A grand flourish, that manifesto the Inter
fraternity Board spouted forth last spring.
With a collective gesture of magnanimity, it
pronounced a thing of the past that apparition
known as "Hell Week." Gone, it said, are the
antiquated', luutal, and unnecessary practices
of yore.
"The abolition of this ti»u<l iti<>iv, as old as
the fraternities themselves, is a great step for
ward," pronounced the Board's chairman.
"Initiation of new members- now will be of a
constrmtive nature, in contrast to the here
tofore childish, high-school' type of prattling
horseplay."
Sounds very noble, doesn't it ?
But there seems to be little, if any difference
between the horseplay of former times and
the foolishness now being practiced.
"Assume the luigle" (categorical impera
tive) still rolls lightly off npperclass tongues,
pledges are subjected to private and public
humiliation, and unnecessary and brutal pun
ishments are still inflicted, while seniors laugh
at the benighted initiates, jumping blindly
through the hoop of tradition for obscure
reasons.
By what manner of reasoning do men con
clude thai such childish antics benefit anyone?
Do fhev really think that a pine paddle ap
plied vigorously to a pledge's person benefits
him physically or spiritually?
And where, oh, where, is the benefit to a
pledge when he must appear in class sleepv
eved and weary, alter a two a.m. excursion
to Mountain View?
Or why do we go to college?
