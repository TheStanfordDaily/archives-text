The drawl, that pleasing, tantalizing hit of
public speaking that songsters are crooning

break any track records between, for example,
the Quad 1 and the post office, or the last class
and the next drinking fountain.
There really isn't any rush. Nobody is any
happier for having whizzed through life on
a special train. At home, in classes, out for a
walk, ride, or stroll—it's lots more fun to take
your timv.
