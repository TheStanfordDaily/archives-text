With airplanes battling the elements somewhere be
tween Britain and Australia, straining motors and
pilots in a mad attempt to win the $40,000 prize of
fered for the first arrival at Sydney, one cannot avoid
wondering just what the practical significance of the
venture is.
Elliott Reid, professor of aerodynamics and former
member of the National Advisory Committee on Aero
nautics at Langley Field, answers that problem in his
comments on the day's news.
"The practical importance of the flight is very great
to principal European nations for they all have far
flung colonial possessions," he says.
"There is a great need for rapid carrying of pas
sengers and mail to the colonies, especially Holland to
Batavia, and England to Australia. These countries are
operating regular mail service to their possessions at
the present time but the speed over the route is rela
tively slow in comparison with rates in this country."
Professor Reid attributes the comparative slowness
of the service on the British and Dutch routes to the
great length of the trip. The problem of preparing the
airways with beacons, emergency landing fields and
meteorological information stations is difficult because
of passing through many countries.
"The present competitive flight is demonstrating
that with most recent equipment such speed can be
made that even flying only by daylight, better time
could be made. It is also proving that the new ma
chines are so reliable that they can get through over
unlighted areas with a fair proportion of success."
At the present time Great Britain, the United States
and Holland are actually in the race. There were en
tries from many countries but various disabilities have
weeded out all but five contestants.
"The technical point of the race ought to be very
gratifying to Americans interested in the future of
aeronautics," Reid believes.
The race has simmered down to two American, tw.o
British, and one Dutch plane. Both American planes
are Boeings, the type now being used for carrying
mail and passengers from San Francisco to Los Angelen
daily. The one Dutch entry that has figured at all
seriously is more or less an experimental type built
for the Holland-Batavia service. It was well up in
the running until it met with an accident.
The British machines should be the fastest planes
in the race as they are small, high-powered planes
built especially for speed. They are two-place jobs
very different from the American entries, which carry
ten passengers and have a crew of three.
"At the rate Britain's Scott has been going, he will
complete the trip in three days, but there is still a
chance that. something may go wrong with the ship as it
is almost experimental, having been test flown only
last September," the professor stated.
The situation sums up on this side of the water to a
very good account of the reliability of American air
craft. No other commercial planes have a chance to
finish ahead of America's two.

daily. The one Dutch entry that has figured at all
seriously is more or less an experimental type built
for the Holland-Batavia service. It was well up in
the running until it met with an accident.
The British machines should be the fastest planes
in the race as they are small, high-powered planes
built especially for speed. They are two-place jobs
very different from the American entries, which carry
ten passengers and have a crew of three.
"At the rate Britain's Scott has been going, he will
complete the trip in three days, but there is still a
chance that. something may go wrong with the ship as it
is almost experimental, having been test flown only
last September," the professor stated.
The situation sums up on this side of the water to a
very good account of the reliability of American air
craft. No other commercial planes have a chance to
finish ahead of America's two.
With airplanes battling the elements somewhere be
tween Britain and Australia, straining motors and
pilots in a mad attempt to win the $40,000 prize of
fered for the first arrival at Sydney, one cannot avoid
wondering just what the practical significance of the
venture is.
Elliott Reid, professor of aerodynamics and former
member of the National Advisory Committee on Aero
nautics at Langley Field, answers that problem in his
comments on the day's news.
"The practical importance of the flight is very great
to principal European nations for they all have far
flung colonial possessions," he says.
"There is a great need for rapid carrying of pas
sengers and mail to the colonies, especially Holland to
Batavia, and England to Australia. These countries are
operating regular mail service to their possessions at
the present time but the speed over the route is rela
tively slow in comparison with rates in this country."
Professor Reid attributes the comparative slowness
of the service on the British and Dutch routes to the
great length of the trip. The problem of preparing the
airways with beacons, emergency landing fields and
meteorological information stations is difficult because
of passing through many countries.
"The present competitive flight is demonstrating
that with most recent equipment such speed can be
made that even flying only by daylight, better time
could be made. It is also proving that the new ma
chines are so reliable that they can get through over
unlighted areas with a fair proportion of success."
At the present time Great Britain, the United States
and Holland are actually in the race. There were en
tries from many countries but various disabilities have
weeded out all but five contestants.
"The technical point of the race ought to be very
gratifying to Americans interested in the future of
aeronautics," Reid believes.
The race has simmered down to two American, tw.o
British, and one Dutch plane. Both American planes
are Boeings, the type now being used for carrying
mail and passengers from San Francisco to Los Angelen
daily. The one Dutch entry that has figured at all

for the Holland-Batavia service. It was well up in
