# BULL SESSION
## A 						FAMILY AFFAIR 
### 
We have wanted to write this
piece for a long while. Rut some-*,
thing has always interfered. Spot
news, that could not wait, or a qtteer
feeling, that would not be downed,
: have kept us vacillating like A.C.
electricity. But the thing persists,
irtnd now it must be told.
Like many other people, we were
preceded at Stanford by a brother.
! And unlike many other people, this
brother was an odd duck—which in
his case was a claim to fame. (This
is a ticklish matter, as you can see;
but out it must). Now this brother
; once wrote a column; strangely
1 enough, it was called Bull Session.
, So long and so well did' he write it,
that his name became inseparably
attached to Bull Session, although
the title of the column had been
originated years before.
Ever since we began this job, we
! have been faced by a long series of
I comparisons, contrasts, and confu
sions with the earlier writer. To
most people "Mellinkoff" is such a
peculiar name that it is inconceiv
able that more than one person can
own it. Consequently, there are a
great many who steadfastly believe
that Brother Abe has never stopped
writing this column since 1930, al
though at least a half-dozen authors
have intervened since he dropped his
> Bull Sessioning pen a year and one
half ago.
We wrote what we thought was a
j fair column last week. At 7:30 in
the morning we popped into the
Cellar for breakfast, gloating and
| gleeful. One of the "old" Stanford
' women rushed up to us bubbling:
i "Did you write that Bull Session
this morning, or did your brother?"
Crushed, we answered solemnly:
"My dear lady, my brother is now
i in France." The morning was # ruined.
From those who claim to be able
to tell the difference between us,
' we are faced with stuff like this:
If the thing appeared ""bad" 'to
them, they do not hesitate to tell
! us, with a silly grin: "Not like the
old Mellinkoff."
If they liked it: "Your brother
! must have helped- you," or, "Almost
as good as Abe's," or—yes, a' few
1 are very flattering. But always the
thing is stacked up alongside some
thing for which we must sadly dis
j claim any credit.
For worse or for better, we are
| not our brother. Yes, damn it, we
; laugh like he does, but that is aIL
Frankly, we like to be damned every
! now and then. It's wonderful for
the soul. But we like to be damned
ion our own merits, and receive
' praise on our own head—and not
' after it comes trickling down
i through a halo thyfc does not be
| long here.
There are some, we know, who
I will take this old thing wrong. But
that sort always does'. It makes them
j happier. So we have not only un
-1 burdened our chest, but have show
' ered great happiness on a select few
i —than which there a can be no
1 greater joy.
—DAVE Mellinkoff.

We have wanted to write this
piece for a long while. Rut some-*,
thing has always interfered. Spot
news, that could not wait, or a qtteer
feeling, that would not be downed,
: have kept us vacillating like A.C.
electricity. But the thing persists,
irtnd now it must be told.
Like many other people, we were
preceded at Stanford by a brother.
! And unlike many other people, this
brother was an odd duck—which in
his case was a claim to fame. (This
is a ticklish matter, as you can see;
but out it must). Now this brother
; once wrote a column; strangely
1 enough, it was called Bull Session.
, So long and so well did' he write it,
that his name became inseparably
attached to Bull Session, although
the title of the column had been
originated years before.
Ever since we began this job, we
! have been faced by a long series of
I comparisons, contrasts, and confu
sions with the earlier writer. To
most people "Mellinkoff" is such a
peculiar name that it is inconceiv
able that more than one person can
own it. Consequently, there are a
great many who steadfastly believe
that Brother Abe has never stopped
writing this column since 1930, al
though at least a half-dozen authors
have intervened since he dropped his
> Bull Sessioning pen a year and one
half ago.
We wrote what we thought was a
j fair column last week. At 7:30 in
the morning we popped into the
Cellar for breakfast, gloating and
| gleeful. One of the "old" Stanford
' women rushed up to us bubbling:
i "Did you write that Bull Session
this morning, or did your brother?"
Crushed, we answered solemnly:
"My dear lady, my brother is now
i in France." The morning was # ruined.
From those who claim to be able
to tell the difference between us,
' we are faced with stuff like this:
If the thing appeared ""bad" 'to
them, they do not hesitate to tell
! us, with a silly grin: "Not like the
old Mellinkoff."
If they liked it: "Your brother
! must have helped- you," or, "Almost
as good as Abe's," or—yes, a' few
1 are very flattering. But always the
thing is stacked up alongside some
thing for which we must sadly dis
j claim any credit.
