"DESIRABLE"
At the Varsity Theater
Once in a lifetime do two good
pictures appear on a double bill, but
the Varsity offers such a combina
tion in the billing of "The Mdn of
Two Faces" with "Desirable."
"The Man of Two Facet - ," despite
the title, is not another version of

Dr. Jekyll and
Mr. Hyde, but
the story of an
unscrupulous
hypnotist and his
ruinous influ
ence on the mind
and life of- his
wife, Mary As-

tor, until her hard-drinking, irre
sponsible, and thoroughly likeable
brother, Edward G. Robinson, ends
it all by what he thinks is the perfect
crime. A. "Lady and the Tiger"
ending leaves you to decide for
yourself whether Robinson hangs for
the murder.
Jean Muir in "Desirable", offers a
contrast, but not so strong as to be
incongruous as so many double bills
are.
Sent home from school because of
an epidemic, the 19-year-old heroine
is a source of emberrassment to her
"young" actress mother, Veree Teas
dale.
Muir as the awkward, long-legged
heroine may leave you exhausted by
her undiminished exuberance, but
she is a welcome relief after a long
line of langorously sophisticated
heroines.
George Brent is the handsome
bone of contention between mother
and daughter. —Dodds.
