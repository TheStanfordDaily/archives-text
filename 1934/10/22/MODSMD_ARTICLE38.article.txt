"SUN-UP"
At t-he Palo Alto Community Thoatov
Aji amateur production unusually
free from amateurism, "Sun-Up
was undoubtedly the smoothest,
most convincing, and thoroughly en
joyable presentation of the Palo ATto
Community Players to date.
Concerning itself with the back
woods folk of the North Carolina
mountains, the play shows the con
version of a mother from a narrow
hate and ignorance of law and man
kind, to the view that universal love
is the only path to true happiness.
Kathleen Norris, as the pipe
smoking Widow Cagl'e brought her
role to life with vivid, consistent
focca. Her characterization closely
rivals that of the well-known Lu
cille La Verne, originator of the now
famous role. If Mrs. Norris had
made the Widow a little more stern
in the earlier pail of the play the
climax might have been even
stronger than it was, when the
spirit of her dead son convinces her
that "hate makes war; lovin' 'em
all is what counts."
The rest of the cast were as re
spectively good. One was able to
sit back and enjoy the play, freed
from the usual distracting worries
connected with an amateur produc
tion; such as whether "Johnny"
would retain his plastered beard, or
whether "Susy" would remember
her lines, or if that quivering Hat
would retain its vertical position un
til the final curtain.
Page Beckett, as the Widow's
idealistic son, Rufe, made the com
mon amateur error of failing to fol
low through the thoughts and actions
of his character. After each speech
he would revert to Page Beckett,
hastening back into his role before
his next speech. However, he did
have an understanding and feeling
for his role, and his fault wouldn't
have shown up so obviously if it
hadn't been for the smoothness of
the rest of the cast.
Tom Seller was the surprise of the
evening in the role of The Stranger.
With a much-improved voice and
nearly perfect stage poise, his per
formance showed amazing dramatic
progress from his roles of last year.
Tom Ashlock, too, wai» especially
good as The Preacher, constantly in
need of a nip of corn-whiskey for
his "tech of sickness."
The third act climax was strong,
but the denouement was too slow,
seeming to repeat and then re-repeat
itself. However, Mrs. Norris* final
thrilling speech made one forget this
drag.
The set was well-designed by
Waldemar J-ohansen, expressing per
fectly the spirit of the play. The
lighting was expertly and profes
sionally handled by Royal Schroder,
adding greatly to the dramatic ef
fects.
"Sun-Up" was a most* creditable
performance, one of the first to prove
that a production can be put on in
the Palo Alto Community Theater
worthy of its beauty and expensive
equipment. —Brill.
