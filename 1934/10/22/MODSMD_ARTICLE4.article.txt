The following statement on the de
bate was issued by Robert Gros,
varsity debate manager:
"More heat than light has been
shed in current controversies over
this gubernatorial race in California.
Somewhere between the divergent
extremes of a debatable proposition
lies the truth. To find that truth and
present it cleverly and intelligently
is the role of a good debater. V/e
hope that this impartial considera
tion, giving each side an equal op
portunity to present its case, will do
much to illuminate the cloudy gu
bernatorial question."
Whether or not the audience will
be permitted to question the speak
ers, and whether or not there will be
a decision, has not yet been decided
by the Debate Council and Delta
Sigma Rho. Announcement in re«-
gard to these matters will be forth
coming shortly, however. Consent to
(he debate has definitely been given
by Professor Robert Eckles Swain
of the Committee on Public Exer
cises.

ment held here last spring.
Gros Comments
The following statement on the de
bate was issued by Robert Gros,
varsity debate manager:
"More heat than light has been
shed in current controversies over
this gubernatorial race in California.
Somewhere between the divergent
extremes of a debatable proposition
lies the truth. To find that truth and
present it cleverly and intelligently
is the role of a good debater. V/e
hope that this impartial considera
tion, giving each side an equal op
portunity to present its case, will do
much to illuminate the cloudy gu
bernatorial question."
Whether or not the audience will
be permitted to question the speak
ers, and whether or not there will be
a decision, has not yet been decided
by the Debate Council and Delta
Sigma Rho. Announcement in re«-
gard to these matters will be forth
coming shortly, however. Consent to
(he debate has definitely been given
by Professor Robert Eckles Swain
of the Committee on Public Exer
cises.
