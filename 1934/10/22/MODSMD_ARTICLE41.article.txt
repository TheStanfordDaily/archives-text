THEY HATE, BUT
THEY DON'T KNOW WHY
They don't like him, and won't
until he wins a few games, but no
one knows exactly why they don't
like him.
That seems to be the opinion on
the University of California campus
concerning Coach Navy Bill In
gram at this stage of the season.
It seems to be Ingram's attitude
more than anything else that has
caused so much discontent among
his own student body, alumni, and
merchants surrounding the Bear
campus.
And Ingram's charges and de
nunciations, made last Thursday,
of the "disgraceful lack of loyalty
and petty malicious influences"
served to focus the rabid eye of
publicity on a decidedly unnatural
situation of California's traditional
hating, without knowing exactly
at whom, what, or why the hating
is aimed.
Following the charges, the city
newspapers, of course, played up the
"lack of student support," and an
Oakland paper sold 3000 extra cop
ies on and near the campus itself.
This account, headed by big scare
lines, did not help the situation as
Jar as student support was concerned.
The Daily California!! followed
with a front page editorial Friday
morning asking students to sup
port the team, whether they liked
Ingram personally or not. This
editorial was misinterpreted when
picked, up in the professional
newspapers as a step in a feud
between the student paper and
Coach Ingram.
Apparently the aim for Ingram's
gripe was to enact this idea of psy
chology. He seemingly wanted to
isolate the team from the campus.
And he claims the team is behind
him 100 per cent, which seems at
least 50 per cent true.
But although everyone seems
discontented with the present sit
uation, they would all like to find
out just what it is they don't like.
In the first place> Ingram would be
popular, to a certain extent, if he
won games. Things went fihe until
St. Mary's upset the Bears and C. of
P. almost duplicated this. Ingram's
early season claims, perhaps made
in all sincerity, that the Bears were
world-beaters this year, did not help
after the upsets.
Saturday's U.C.L.A. game was
to have been a crisis, but it did
very little toward clearing things
up, after all. California was not
impressive in winning, 3 to 0, hut
the fact that Ingram's team did
win was enough to temporarily
halt student rumblings.
The Washington-California game
next week likewise is figured to be
a crisis ill the internal situation.
Ingram's attitude of isolating his
team, and "the student body be
damned," together with his policy of
secret practice, and the claim that
he is just a navy man who expects
his players to click their heels at
every command, are some of the
Ihings that help make students
scream at his defeats and ignore
his victories.
