# TROJANS TIE; CAL, CARDS BARELY WIN
## 
### 
Once again the Big Three spent
rather unsatisfactory Saturday af
ternoons as coast football ended an
other week of conference play.
Coast fans should idealize by now
that Spud Lewis' Dons are no longer
a "breather" team, after the slim,
last minute win the Cards managed
to take over the city eleven. Cal also
saved her face at the same moment
in the same way, with Arleigh Wil
liams kicking the three points which
allowed the Bears to gain their ex
pected win over U.C.L.A.
El Trojan, out of the habit of
winning, took another jolt when
Oregon State knotted the count, 6-G,
in the last minutes of play. The
same arm that was responsible for
a 60-yard gain against Stanford two
weeks ago came through for the
Beavers when Danei-i passed to
Campbell for the 40-yard scoring
play. Howard Jones apparently was
saving Cotton Warburton for the
Card game Saturday, as the Ail-
American quarterback went on the
field only for the last minute of play.
Gonzaga, the team which beat
Washington State, itself famous for
a w<?ek as the team which beat
U.S.C. by three touchdowns, won
3.1-0 over Puget Sound.
