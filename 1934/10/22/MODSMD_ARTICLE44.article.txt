# Water Poloists Win From Bruins, 3 to 2
## CARDS OVERCOME TWO POINT LEAD TO TAKE OPENER Taranik's Goal Decides! Exciting Battle After Cook Sinks Two 
### Roger Kimball 
Excitement reached and main
tained a fever pitch in and around
Eneina pools Friday as the Stanford
water polo team won its first coast
conference game by nosing out
U.C.L.A. 3 to 2. The game was one
of the roughest and most hectic ever
played in the local pool, featuring all
kinds of water polo, humorous mo
ments, and great fun for the crowd
and the referee.
Most of the high-class play came
in the opening minutes, during which
the powerful Bruin septet swept into
the lead on two clever shots by their
star forward, Bobby Sellars. Stan
ford was slow in starting, largely
because Captain Leo Cook was
closely shackled by a Uclan guard.
Referee Busy
The giant Card leader finally tal
lied on-short shot, however, and the
score stood at 2 to 1 in the south
erners' favor after two minutes had
elapsed. Referee Stoll beat a con
stant tattq on his whistle, as both
teams were manhandling and duck
ing opponents in a mad scramble
for the ball.
Within another minute Cook
again rang the bell with a beauti
ful backhand toss from close in,
in spite of tight guarding. After
the score was once tied, the In
dians took the upper hand and
controlled the hall most of the
time.
The furious struggle was already
assuming riot proportions as the half
ended, with Wally Wiget and Jim
Benet of Stanford and Sellars and
Dick Daubenspeck of the Bruins
thrown out of the game for unnec
essary roughness.
Wiget Ejected
Nort Thornton's Indians came back
madder and stronger than ever after
the short rest, and Vlad Taranik soon
took a pass from Cook and fired l a
bullet-like shot to give Stanford her
third goal and the lead, 3 to 2. Cook
narrowly missed several close ones,
but numerous other shots by both
teams became wilder as the play
grew rougher and the crowd noisier.
Wally Wiget, Indian guard, was
expelled from the fray for the sec
ond time, midway in the second half,
soon followed by Sellars and Allport
of the Uclans and Cook and Bill
Woodard of Stanford.
Each team finished the game
with only five men playing. A
constant three - cornered verbal
fight was in progress between the
referee, the U.C.L.A. team, and the
pro-Stanford crowd.
In the closing stages of the melee,
the Bruins kept the ball most of the
time, but barely failed to score on
frantic shots. Bedlam was loose and
the crowd was in an uproar as the
final gun fired, Stanford still leading
hy a red whisker.
Frosh Win 8-3
Captain Cook, Woodard, and
Benet starred for the Indians, and
Sellars, Daubenspeck, and Bill Knox
looked best for U.C.L.A. The var
sity's next game is a return contest
with Lakeside in Oakland at 8:30
p.m. Wednesday, October 24.
A preliminary game that started
out as a hard struggle soon developed
into a rout as the Card frosh de
feated Palo Alto High, 8 to 3. Half

time score was 2 to 1, but Papoose
reserve strength proved too much
for the preps in the final minutes.
Warren Smith, with four goals, and
Bill Hanna led the frosh to victory,
while Jack and Lloyd Wilson and
Jack Parker looked best for Paly
High.
