# VETERAN S.F.U. SOCCER AGGREGATION DEFEATS CARDS 5-1 IN LOPSIDED TILT

### John McClelland 
Displaying the same brand of
heady soccer that brought them the
conference championship in 1932
and '33, the Dons of San Francisco
University Saturday defeated the ;
Card eleven 5-1 in San Francisco.
With the same squad of veteran
players they had last year, the Dons
narted out on the offensive at an
unusually hot pace. Their first score 1
came when Applegate, center for
ward, headed the ball into the net j
in the first quarter. In the second |
period the city men literally ran wild i
in the Card territory and scored'
three goals in quick succession.
Although the score of the game j
points to a superior brand of play |
on the part of S.F.U., the Stanford
men played by far their best game 1
yet this season and were much more j
accurate in passing and clearing
than in previous tilts.
In the second half the Indians |
seemed to have gotten their bearings
against the champions and held them |

even, a single goal being scored by j
each side.
The Stanford goal came on a sen- ;
sational shot from the foot of Carl 1
Eitnier, right half, who was put into :
the. game in the last quarter. After j
assisting in several clears Eitnier j
dribbled the ball to the center stripe i
and took a long, looping shot at the j
goal. The ball lit in front of the goal, j
drew the goalie out of position and I
then bounced into the net.
Throughout the game, Stanford j
offense and defense play centered
around' Captain Waddy White, i
Playing left half, he was nearly al
ways in the thick of the action. Dick !
Bullis, right back, turned in an un- |
usually fine performance, -as did i
also Pete Knecht, Ruddy Gonzales, i
and Bob Hall.
Approximately 100,000 needy ;
young men and women are receiv- I
irig SERA funds to allow them to i
continue their education in colleges i
