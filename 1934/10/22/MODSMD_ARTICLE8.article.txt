Mail orders for tickets to the pro

to be presented November 2, are
being received by Dick Frank, dra
matics manager. The prices of the
seats are 50 cents, 75 cents, and $1.
The unusually heavy sale up to
this date indicates a large attend
ance, and as the regular sale doeÂ£
not start until Qctober 29, it is ad
vised that the tickets be bought by
mail, in order to obtain as good seats
as possible.
Unlike previous plays, "One Sun
day Afternoon" is being rehearsed
on a definite schedule. Each week
a certain part of the production is
practiced.
The five leading characters, which
were chosen on October, are: Paul
Crary as "BifT" Grimes, Allen O'Neil
as Hugo Barnstead, Kay Arthur as
Virginia Brush, and Harriet Hull
Kilby as Annie Lind, and Phil
Brown as "Snappy" Downer.
"One Sunday Afternoon," recently
filmed by Gary Cooper, contrasts
the wholesome virtues of yesterday
with the frivolity of today, iri a light
comedy style.
