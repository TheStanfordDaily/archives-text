# B.A.C. Revokes Students' Cards For Illegal Use
## Twelve Deprived of Use Of Tickets for Loaning To Non-Students S.C. DUCATS ALL SOLD Waiting List Is Last Resort For Late Rooters 
### 
Twelve Stanford students, includ
ing two football players, were today
deprived of their ticket privileges for
Ihe year when the BA.C. took away
their student body cards for illegally
loaning them at Saturday's football
game.
The 12. student cards were taken
U P by gatemen at the game on sus
picion. In all cases the users turned
out not to be students.
"Long Been a Trouble"
The practice of loaning registra
tion cards to non-students has
troubled the Stanford looting section
too long, according to Graduate
Manager Alfred R. Masters. The
penalty for the misuse of the cards
is their confiscation and withdrawal
of permission for the offender to at
tend the game for which he loaned
the card.
As a result of the apprehension
of the above students, tickct-tak
crs have been instructed to watch
closely at future games for all such
irregular practices.
The main reason for the strict en
forcement of the non-lending rule is
that rooting sections at the games
are likely to be filled with those who
have no right to be there, thus shut
ting out legitimate rooters, explained
Masters.
S.C. Ducats Sold
The B.A.C. has announced that all
rooters' tickets for next Saturday's
U.S.C. contest a're & now sold out.
Those who are yet without ducats
may sign the waiting list at the
B.A.C. today. Those rooters' tickets
which are turned back will be resold
to students in the order of their
application.
Preceding the game on Saturday
will be the yearly clash between
Stanford and S.C. frosh at 11:15. In
the past this game has drawn crowds
which rival the Little Big Game, and
promises to be more interesting than
ever this year.
