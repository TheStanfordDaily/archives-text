# S.C. GAME HOP TO BE UNIQUE
## Trojan Fans Welcome At Campus Celebration 
### 
Climaxing an afternoon of hot
competition between the Indians and
the Jones boys, the Trojan Game
Dance Saturday night in the Wom
en's gym promises to be the out
standing social event of the quarter,
Johnny Mottram, dance committee
chairman, forecasted yesterday.
S.C. Campus Invited
Invitation has been extended to
the S.C. campus' through the "Daily
Trojan," Mottram said. "There will
be a large representation here from
Troy, and it's up to the Stanford
rough to show them a real turn-out.
And the difference between $1.25
and the prices of San Francisco hos
telries that night should be an added
incentive."
Some really unusual entertain
ment is promised by the Cardinal
dance committee to augment the
nationally-known music of Ed Fitz
patrick's orchestra. Fitzpatrick has
just completed an engagement at the
Club Del Mar in Santa Monica,
where his band was featured on the
Southern California air waves.
Setting Being Groomed
Decorations and lighting effects
are rapidly taking form, and will
provide a setting for the friendly
get-together of the two schools after
the rivalry is worked off on the
gridiron in the afternoon.
Refreshments will be served, and
are included in the cost of the bids,
which are on sale now at the A.S.S.U.
office for $1.25.
