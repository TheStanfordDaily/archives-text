# Bridge Group Deaf To Willis' Span Proposals

### PHIL BERNHEIM 
Appealing before the building
committee of the Golden Gate
Bridge yesterday, Dr. Dailey' Willis,
emeritus professor of geology, re
iterated his contentions that the
south pier foundations are unsafe,
"I am again disappointed at the
attitude assumed by the members
of the committee in the hearing,"
said Dr. Willis. "I had hoped for a
fair discussion of the evidence in
which such data a.s I had gathered
might be compared with the more
detailed information possessed by
the bridge engineers, especially in
regard to their soundings and the
shape of the bottom since they
blasted portions of it away."
Lashing out sarcastically at the
committee's attitude in cross-ex-

amining him, Dr. Willis said, "It
is to be expected that reasonable
inferences may be characterized as
guesses and that the facts which my
studies have brought out will either
be evaded or denied.
"The real issue remains to be de
cided, and only the public can de
cide it—that is, whether the public
is willing to continue to buy bonds
to build a bridge upon the opinion
of one geologist and a group of
business men who do not understand
either geology 01* engineering."
Asked if lie thought that his ap
peal for an impartial federal com
mission to study the situation would
be effective, Dr. Willis replied, "1
have 110 reason to suppose that the
board will change its present pur
pose."
