# GUBERNATORIAL STRAW VOTE TO BE TOMORROW
## Daily Staff Will Sponsor Campus Polls at Post Office, Law Steps 
### 
"Are you for Sinclair, Merriam,
or Haight?" That is the question to
be answered at the polls tomorrow
when a campus stxaw vote will be
taken. The time: 8 until 12:15
o'clock. The place: the law steps
from 8 to 11:15 o'clock and in front
of the post office from 11:15 to 12:15.
The voters: all Stanford students.
The straw vote is being con
ducted by the editorial staff of
the Stanford Daily to determine
local feeling on the present race
for the governorship of California.
The second question, also stimu
lated by the coming election, is, "Do
you believe the EPIC plan would be
a success if put into action?" The
great amount, of discussion in state
newspapers and periodicals has
prompted this vote.
Questions on Ballots
Due to recent, radio broadcasts,
and current campus discussions on
our national administration the fol
lowing two questions have been
added to complete the ballot "Would
you vote for Roosevelt if he were
up for re-election today?" and "Do
you believe the NRA and New Deal
have been an aid to recovery?"
The polls will be in charge of
Daily staff members. All ballots will
be secret but names will be checked
in the bawl-out as votes are cast.
Faculty To Vote
In order to make a more complete
survey of the campus a vote will be
taken of the faculty through the
department heads. Ballots will be
distributed to the faculty this after
noon and collected tomorrow noon,
when the student polls will also
close. Complete returns will be pub
lished Thursday.
Those assisting at the polls are:
Frank Orr, Bob Calkins, Jane
Dodge, Frank Treinaine, Barbara

and Elaine Frisk. A time schedule
will be published tomorrow.
