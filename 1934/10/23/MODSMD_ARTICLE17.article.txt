# Ad Building Study Opens
## 
### 
Last night the University's new
overflow study room in the main
hall of the Administration building
was first opened for use. With table
space for 160, this addition to the
rooms set aside for study purposes is
expected to take care of the students
which the library has not been able
to accommodate during the "rush"
study hours.
The reserve books available in
the Ad building study hall are
mainly for lower division courses
and arc mostly single copies.
A distinctive feature of the room
is the new type of study lamp, a
highly scientific attempt by a com
mittee of electrical engineers to sat
isfy the lighting necessities of the
student.
In appearance the new type makes
a radical departure from present
conceptions of lighting facilities for
the study table. It consists of a white
porcelain cup, about 10 inches across
and open at the top, in which is the
sockct. This is set on a metal rod
standing nearly three feet above the
table.
