bers of the "1000" uncertain as to

The Vocational Guidance Com- j
mittee, at its initial meeting yester- I
day, decided to finance the test \
through Women's Conference funds j
and make it available to students in |
any year.
Alice Ingraham Bodle will grant I
interviews to all university women |
in need of occupational advice.
The test consists of eight pages of i
pertinent and varied questions cal- j
culated to rate occupational interests.
Such data as likes and dislikes in |
occupations, amusements, activities, j
peculiarities of people, and a self- j
rating of present abilities and char- i
acteristics constitute the examina- j
tion.
Professor Edward K. Strong, Jr., i
of the Stanford psychology depart- '
ment, nationally noted vocational j
authority, compiled the question
naire, which is considered the out
standing test of its kind.
Members of the committee who
will, supervise work during the year,
planning field trips and distributing i
the questionnaire, include Florence
Cohen, chairman, Joan Hayes, Ruth
Neupert, and Annalec Whitmore.
