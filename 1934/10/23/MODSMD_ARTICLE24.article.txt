# Squad In Good Shape For S. C., Practice Shows
## Whole Card Team Due To Be in Tip Top Shape Next Saturday ADAMS WEARS BRACE Ankle Injury of Topping Nearly Recovered 
### Mort D'Evelyn 
That the Cards will enter next
Saturday's Trojan contest in nearly
tip-top shape was shown in practice
last night when Coach Tiny Thorn
hill sent his men through an hour
and a half of signal drill.
While no team can take GO min
utes of the hard tackling and driving
blocking such us San Francisco Uni
versity handed out last Saturday
without suffering plenty of bruises
and stiffness, the condition of the
Cards as a whole was better than at
this time last week.
Woody Adams Back
Woody Adams, regular left guard
and the lower denomination of the
Woolworth pair, was back in the
line-up again. Adams' jaw, badly
injured in the Northwestern game
of ten days ago, will be protected
by the same guard that Bones Ham
ilton used during the latter half of
last season. The combination of
aluminum faced with leather and at
tached to an ordinary helmet should
allow Adams to engage in line-play
with S.C.'s newly-found center trio
without fear of injury.

The other first stringer forced to
the sidelines because of an injury
received in the Northwestern win,
Keith Topping, will be able to play
part of the Trojan contest at least.
The lanky end's turned ankle
seemed to be able to stand straight
running last night, but will be far
from its usual strength by Saturday.
While scouting coaches and the
local press that had viewed the
S.F.U. game were hailing him as
one of the hardest hacks to tackle
that the Coast has shown this
year, Frank Alustiza found himself
the only varsity man not able to
report to practice last night. The
Basque spent the afternoon baking
a leg bruise, which is not consid
ered serious.
A-ide from the customary oh's and
ah's which follow such a game as
Saturday's, in which "little" S.F.U.
nearly beat "big" Stanford, coast
football fans are loudest in the praise
of Monk Moscrip's end work. Mos
crip has been on the spot of late,
clue to the more than ordinary num
ber of critics that follow the play of
a much-publicized gridder.
Moscrip Holds Up
Last Saturday Moscrip showed
that he can end the fourth quarter
with the same pace that he started
the first'. Moscrip also proved the
boast that his fans have made that
the Stanford end is one of the fastest
football players in the country. Time
and again Moscrip beat the safety
man to the ball on punts. Other
times the Don safety, Mike Bac
ciarini, who showed himself to be a
flashy open field runner at other
times in the game, found Moscrip's
accurate tackling cutting his punt
returns to practically nothing.
