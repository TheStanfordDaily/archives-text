# Just How Much Is Football Worth?

Alhletes, on the gridiron, track, or diamond,
arc receiving some sort of financial support
from one source or another in every Coast
university. If there is one exception to this
statement, we could not name the institution*
The few hundred hard-working, clean-cut,
deserving fellows in California, Oregon, Wash
ington, etc., who receive that aid today do so
half defiantly, perhaps a bit doubtfully. They
do so with the knowledge that the high and
mighty have ruled (Tor self-protection) that
"subsidization," or its unhappy equal "prose
lyting," is considered "unfair practice." Isn't
it about time that somebody put an end to all
this hypocrisy?

if ideals must fall, and we are to admit
that "amateur" athletics have not always been
successful, we may yet save something from
the crash.
Athletes today resent the inference that
they are subject to proselyting in any form
whatsoever. Victims of a system that has
developed into a self-perpetuating inverted
pyramid of increasing proportions, the fel
lows who devote all of their spare moments
to long, hard, grueling practice periods right
fully believe that they are entitled to some
means of compensation for the loss of possible
employment during those hours of training.
It is diflicult for the scholastic minded pro
lessor to countenance official aid for these
men. I nhersilies, backs to the wall, have
unhappily been forced to maintain strict offt
eial disapproval of so-called commercializa
tion of athletics, and at the same time wink
good - humoredly in the direction of fond
alumni, coaches, and graduate managers.
There is one thing to be done. Pacific Coast
Conference heads can open negotiations im
mediately, laying plans for an inoffensive
manner of taking care of varsity athletes that
would be legal, open to public notice, and
devoid of any subterfuge. A definite meeting
before the first of the year could then iron
out final difficulties.
Athletes do not have to be hired at so much
an hour (i.e., the ditch digger). Hut there
is no horrible crime in waiving tuition, or
providing a legitimate means of earning ade
quate room and board.
It's much worse in the dark, anyway. Let's
turn on the lights and see what Ihe other
fellow is doing.
