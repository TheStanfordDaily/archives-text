Nearly forty years ago when Ihe silver
tongued, silver-advocating William Jennings
Bryan threw the fear of God into the Kastern
hankers, American politics was laced with a
situation similar to that which is now throw
ing the good people of California into a hys
terica) furore.
Hiding into favor on the wave of discontent
that was sel in motion hv the depression of
Bryan swept into the Democratic nomi
nation for the presidency and stumped the
country advocating the somewhat nebulous
plan of Ki-to-l coinage of silver as ;t cure-all
for our social and economic ills.
Opposing him with every weapon that
money could buy was Mark Hanna and his
Itepuhlican organization with William Mc-
Kinley as their standard-bearer. Some six
million Americans expressed a preference for
Me Kin lev while five million favored Bryan.
Thus narrowly was America made safe for
conservatism. Bryan's plan may have been
economically unsound hut he was sincere in
his efforts to aid the common man. The sev

eral millions of Americans who voted I'or him }
were not Jill crazy nor were they bent upon
destroying the forces of law and property.
Now as then the long-suffering common |
man is seeking a solution for his economic
ills. Any plan, however doubtful its validity,
finds it willing following if its purpose is
humanitarian.
Hut now ;is in '!)(> the election will not Ik'
decided upon the relative merits of the com- j
pcting platforms and candidates. Scientific
economic and social analysis is something that
the average voter is not capable of himself. :
Disinterested opinion is essential if democracy
is to function successfully.
The problem of the California voter in this
year of our Lord 1034 is to find such disin
terested opinion. Propaganda will determine
the issue, not thoughtful analysis.
