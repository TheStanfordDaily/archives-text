# Hold Your Own Ticket

Twelve owners of autumn quarter regis
tration cards felt the axe of impending dis
aster as the Hoard of Athletic Control right
fully refused admittance to a similar number
of individuals who presented them for ad
mittance to the S.F.I', game Saturday.
The twelve ticket holders, not only being
very thoroughly embarrassed at being turned
away from the promised land within sight of
the plenty, found themselves helpless while
galemcn quietly appropriated said registra
tion cards and filed them with the H.A.C. for
future reference and destruction.
It's merely a warning as to what might
happen to the fellow who tries to be a real
pal and lets the fellow next door borrow his
registration card for his brother-in-law's third
cousin on his mother's side next Saturday.
The Southern California game is going to be
well worth seeing, but it would be 100 bad
to lose ticket privileges for the Hig Game
merely by attempting a poor imitation of the
good Samaritan act.
It doesn't help the rooting section any, it
doesn't help you any, and it may cause a few
people lots of grief. Go to the game in person
and enjoy it. It's lots more fun.
