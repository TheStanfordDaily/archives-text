# Copp, Heche Choose Skits For Gaieties
## Tryouts Postponed From Today to Thursday 
### 
Chorus tryouts for the Big Game
Gaieties, originally slated for today,
have been shifted to Thursday after
noon from 3 to 5 o'clock, place to be
announced in tomorrow's Daily.
Yesterday saw a bevy of enterpris
ing chorines, for the most pai't ex
perienced, who ran through the
routines set in promising fashion.
The chorus will not be named until
after Thursday's session, however,
stresses Dance Director H. M. Beau
doin. Blondes are especially in de
mand.
Deadline for all musical contribu
tions, whether songs, ensembles, or
sketches, has been set definitely for
Friday. Gordon Heche will receive
all entries.
Copp Chooses Skits
Jim Copp announces that tenta
tive choice of skits has been made.
Three sororities — Kappa, Delta
Gamma, and Pi Phi—have submitted
skits, while the works of individual
students* far outnumber that of fra
ternities.
Final decision will be made Thurs
day afternoon in the Little Theater,
unless a time has already been
scheduled. Each author should make
an appointment with Copp, Alpha
Sig house, and appear with a cast
prepared to present the skit.
He stresses the fact that all skits
not presented on Thursday will be
dropped automatically from the list,
however excellent they may be.
