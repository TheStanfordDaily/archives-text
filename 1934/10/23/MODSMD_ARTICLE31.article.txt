### CHARLOTTE BURRIDGE 
WITH ELLERY C. STOWELL
Economic depression, New Deal activities, and elec
tions have been occupying the center of the stage
lately almost to the point of our forgetting the existence
of the convalescing League of Nations and the World
Court. Weak as it is at the present time, the League
is living 'on in its quiet way, waiting for the turning
of events to bring nourishment from the United States
and Japan.
Ellery C. Stowell, a visiting professor from the
American University at Washington, D.C., has attended
many international peace conferences as secretary to
United States representatives. He has great faith in
the League's future and expects Roosevelt to encour
age the United States to join the World Court as soon
as elections are over. If they should succeed in estab
lishing peace between Bolivia and Paraguay, a favor
able impression would be created in this country, ac
cording to the political scientist.
"Unofficially we have co-operated more and
more with the League of Nations for a consider
able length of time," he says. "That is all we can
expect now. Ultimately we may hope to see the
United States take an active part in League coun
cils either as a member or by closer co-operation
through our observers at Switzerland."
The admission of Russia to the family of nations is
a great step forward, the professor believes. If the
United States should join it would have great influence
in preventing separation of countries from the group as
they have in the past, he predicts.
"When the Manchukuo matter is settled and present
unsatisfactory conditions in the Orient remedied, Japan
may feel better about League affiliation."
"I don't think that students of political science
ever expected the League to be able to prevent
wars, but I think most of them have been sur
prised at what a valuable service it has played.
There is every indication of its being able to play
an increasingly worth-while part in world affairs."
The professor pointed out that we are now in such
a period of crisis that it is hard to judge the value of
institutions like the League, which cannot be depended
on to decide major problems between nations until we
have fuller understanding pf international problems.
"Future security of international relations depends
on all nations doing their part," Stowell states. "The
biggest difficulty is that it is hard to decide who is the
aggressor, and the United States is not satisfied to let
any other nation or group of nations decide for her."
"I believe that we are ready to do our part in
co-operating against unprovoked aggression. In
case of a political struggle we could certainly be
expected to keep out of it," he assures.
No doubt the results of the last conflict would make
the United States inclined to keep out of any situations
which were mainly political.
