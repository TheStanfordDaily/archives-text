# BULL SESSION
## UNEASY STANDS THE BRIDGE 
### 
It may be more fun to know, but
! there are a great many people who
! dc get a tremendous kick out of
being fooled. And often as not, the
kick is genuine—a kick in the pants.
Yet though people have been fooled
for so long—on so many different
occasions, most of us do not even
; take the barest precautions to pre
vent our being sold a gold brick, a
| half interest in the Washington
Monument, or « shaky Golden Gate
bridge.
!
In common with most San Fran
! ciscans, we do not know whether
the bridge is being built on serpen
tine, sand, or marbles. Like most
San Franciscans, we do not know
whether serpentine will slide or stay
; put. But then, like mdst San Fran
! ciscans, we have had our tonsils
out, and cannot to this day tell the
1 difference between a tonsil and the
| left gizard of a chicken. As we re
[ call it, the parents called in a man
who could, for which we are grate-
•
Experts have come, and examined
I the bridge footing. One says "yes,"
! and one says "no." But the one who
says "yes" is in with the bridge
j gang, and the one who says "no" is
i a disinterested man of science. So,
hot and stinking is the pitch poured
1 on the "man of science"; and work
'on the bridge continues. The Stan
ford professor is "An Enemy of the
People"; he is questioning the falli
| bility of the powers. Moreover, he
, might bring unfavorable publicity to
! the City on the Bay. And, even
i though this publicity may save the
! very lives of future dwellers on the
i bay, the man is maligned and re-
I tused the right to a just hearing.
! Anyone who has ever doubted the
truth of Ibsen's thesis must now be
1 convinced.
Of course, Dr. Willis may be
wrong. But at least call in mpre ex
perts to or confirm him. be
i fore villifying the man, and contin
| uing work on a project that may
! mean public disaster—in terms of
dollars and lives.
Why is Dr. Willis scoffed at by
the bridge builders? He has cut
i deeply into one of the most sensi
tive and harmful pieces of buncombe
in the United States, and especially
California. He has irked the "CIVIC
PRIDE" of San Francisco. Such
"pride" is a mania, and not a sincere
interest in the welfare of the com
! munity. It is a "pride" that admits
lof no mistake, that will not turn

j back, that, plunges blindly into chaos
! to the music of brass bands.
But someday Dr. Willis will be
' vindicated, if not in the near fu-
I ture. The accusation at the bridge
1 builders will last forever. The bridge
i will not. —Dave Mellinkoft".
