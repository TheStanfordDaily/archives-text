| "STAMBOUL QUEST"
At the Menlo Theater
The prologue tells us that this pic
! ture is to deal with "Counter-Es
pionage," but it's still the same ojd
spy-dough to us, and filled with the
same old rahs-berry juice. It's the

Great War again,
and the Ger
mans are afraid
that the Turks
won't help them
sink the poor,
defenseless Brit
ish navy.
Suffice it to

! say that charming spy-ess, Myrna
Loy, discovers for herself that love
i and duty don't mix on the Bos
porus (and right after seeing that
i Mati Hari got hers, too!) By a clever
! twist of fate (and scenario) the
lover (George Brent) isn't really
shot. As the piece de resistance, he
i suddenly appears to rescue the
beauteous Myrna from the confines
oi a convent and temporary madness.
"City Limits," with Frank Craven
I and Sally Blane, is the second fea
i ture on the program. —Brill.

j "BELLE OF THE NINETIES"
I At the Stanford
| Mae West, the gal with the ball
I bearing hips, is back in town!
She's in a picture called (because
! other titles were censored) "Belle
lof the Nineties." It wasn't a par-

ticularly good
picture, but who
cares? The pub
lic won't, and;
neither will the j
box office.
The latest;
Westian opus is j
vaudeville two- j

act strung around a thin, if not
threadbare, plot. The chief reason
for any story at all is to provide a
number of "straight" men (3nd
women, too) to feed Mae her lines.
She's got a wise-crack for each and
every one, two for a nickel, and
your money back if they don't make
you chortle. Some of them actually
do. It's just give and take all the
way, with Mae doing all the giving.
And can she dish it out!
The supporting cast is relatively

unimportant, as they're all foils for
la West. There's Roger Pryor and
Johnny Mack Brown; and John Mil
jan is the most perfect villain we
ever saw.
There are two good songs, "My
Old Flame" and "Troubled Waters,"
the latter worked in against a re
vival meeting background, and very
effective, too. Duke Ellington's or
chestra, which only does accompani
ments, was swell.
This picture may bring back fond
memories of the "good old days" to
members of the older generation, !
but to a 1934 collegian it is pretty
much a case of "the good old days j
that never were." Chief interest for
the modern generation will lie in
the gags. —Bernheim.
