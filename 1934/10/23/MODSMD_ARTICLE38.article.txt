# Frosh To Pit Speed Against S.C. Power In Preliminary Tilt
## Babe Grid Team Strives To Keep Victory Record Clean 
### Warren Breed 
Whether a fast set of Card frosh
backs and a sure-fire passing attack
can score more points than a poten
tially powerful U.S.F. freshman
eleven will be tlie question Saturday
forenoon in the Troy varsity pre
liminary.
Coaph Jeff Cravath's Trobabes
proved themselves to be no laggards
Saturday by holding the Cal Frosh
"wonder team" to a 14-0 count. The
.southern yearlings hav'j beaten some
of the better J.C. teams in the Los
Angeles district, but from reports
have pot as yet found a certain start
ing eleven.
Card Frosh Undefeated
By virtue of a 21-6 victory over
San Mateo J.C. Saturday, the Card
frosh retain their undefeated stand
ing. A passing attack that will not
be denied put the frosh in line for
two of the scores.
Fullbacks Bill Paulman and Glenn
Hamilton fired the tosses and Ber
neth Layer and Grant Stone, ends,
were on hand to receive them for
yards and first downs. An added
option of lateral tosses to the side
lines after a short forward doubles
the potentiality of offensive threat.
New Plays Added
Coach Bradshaw worked his full
squad on plays last night, running
them over again and again to insure
smoother team-work and co-opera
tion in the interference phalanx. He
added a couple of new plays to the
growing list, extra twists from the
old formations.
Bradshaw's backs are in general
fast and light. The heaviest is full
back Hamilton, who weighs in at
about 188. Bill Paulman, who has
been starting most of the games at
full, so far, is more than ten pounds
lighter, so can not possess all the
power and drive of the usual 200-
pound, bone-crushing fullback.
Two Light Ilalfs
At the two halfback posts are sev
eral light men. Tommy Collins
stands at about 175, ahead of Jimmy
Coffis by about five pounds. The
others, Leo Madlem, Tex Luckett,
and Ed Gillette, are all under 165,
which is considerably under the av
erage frosh poundage.
Bill Roberts, playing quarterback,
made his tenure on the position a
little firmer with a nice game against
San Mateo Saturday. He does not
carry ' the ball much, but in his
blocking assignments and general
field play shows an adaptability for
the job.
The frosh reserves will make it. a
triple bill Saturday, playing an early
game In the morning, which will be
followed at noon by the S.C. frosh
game, and the varsity encounter in
the stellar role.

little firmer with a nice game against
San Mateo Saturday. He does not
carry ' the ball much, but in his
blocking assignments and general
field play shows an adaptability for
the job.
The frosh reserves will make it. a
triple bill Saturday, playing an early
game In the morning, which will be
followed at noon by the S.C. frosh
game, and the varsity encounter in
the stellar role.
Whether a fast set of Card frosh
backs and a sure-fire passing attack
can score more points than a poten
tially powerful U.S.F. freshman
eleven will be tlie question Saturday
forenoon in the Troy varsity pre
liminary.
Coaph Jeff Cravath's Trobabes
proved themselves to be no laggards
Saturday by holding the Cal Frosh
"wonder team" to a 14-0 count. The
.southern yearlings hav'j beaten some
of the better J.C. teams in the Los
Angeles district, but from reports
have pot as yet found a certain start
ing eleven.
Card Frosh Undefeated
By virtue of a 21-6 victory over
San Mateo J.C. Saturday, the Card
frosh retain their undefeated stand
ing. A passing attack that will not
be denied put the frosh in line for
two of the scores.
Fullbacks Bill Paulman and Glenn
Hamilton fired the tosses and Ber
neth Layer and Grant Stone, ends,
were on hand to receive them for
yards and first downs. An added
option of lateral tosses to the side
lines after a short forward doubles
the potentiality of offensive threat.
New Plays Added
Coach Bradshaw worked his full
squad on plays last night, running
them over again and again to insure
smoother team-work and co-opera
tion in the interference phalanx. He
added a couple of new plays to the
growing list, extra twists from the
old formations.
Bradshaw's backs are in general
fast and light. The heaviest is full
back Hamilton, who weighs in at
about 188. Bill Paulman, who has
been starting most of the games at
full, so far, is more than ten pounds
lighter, so can not possess all the
power and drive of the usual 200-
pound, bone-crushing fullback.
Two Light Ilalfs
At the two halfback posts are sev
eral light men. Tommy Collins
stands at about 175, ahead of Jimmy
Coffis by about five pounds. The
others, Leo Madlem, Tex Luckett,
and Ed Gillette, are all under 165,
which is considerably under the av
erage frosh poundage.
Bill Roberts, playing quarterback,
made his tenure on the position a
little firmer with a nice game against
San Mateo Saturday. He does not
carry ' the ball much, but in his
blocking assignments and general
field play shows an adaptability for
the job.
