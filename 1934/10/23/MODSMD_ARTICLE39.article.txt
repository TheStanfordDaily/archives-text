# Saturday's Game Will Feature Women's Stunts
## 
### 
At their meeting in the Old Union
last night, Rally Committee and
Women's activities groups made
plans for Saturday's Trojan-Card
football game.
Instituting a new precedent at
Stanford, women will hold cards in
the rooting section .at the game.
Close to 700 of them will fill out a
section of 2000 rooters.
Miriam Kropp, head of the Wom
en's committee, announced that all
women planning to attend the game
will be required to wear white, to
insure the success of the card stunts.
All men are likewise expected to
wear white shirts in the section. At
the Northwestern tilt, two blue
shirted individuals lost this apparel
during the game, and Rally Com
mittee men warn them to avoid tak
ing the risk.
