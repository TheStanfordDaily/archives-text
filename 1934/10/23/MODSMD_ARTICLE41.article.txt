DEAD OR
ALIVE
The conference is over, but the j
issue is still waiting to be settled. ]
The quection is: "Should women's I
sports continue to be scored on class (
basis on Triangular Sports day or j
on an inter-collegiate basis?"
The question might be stated in !
another way: "Should women's J
sports continue to be slightly dead !
or should a small dose of inter- (
collegiate competition be given 10 j
infuse vigor and enthusiasm?"
Women's sports are a very fine ;
thing, and there are many fine ath
letes among women here and else
where, but even the finest of athletes
sometimes lose their enthusiasm for
sports from lack of competition.
NOW OR
NEVER
And then it' is too bad that the
stimulus of competition is lacking
just at the time of life when it
would produce the greatest results in
skill and enjoyment.
It is notoriously true that men |
and women do not put forth the
effort to keep up their interest in
sports unless it is in a profes
sional way after they leave col- ;
lege.
At college the condition is ideal
for athletics, because there are j
plenty more who like the same sport i
and it is not hard to join a group or!
class and get a lot of fun out of it.
FROM CAUSE
TO EFFECT
There are those who would like i
to see longer distance events in |
swimming, for instance. As it is now ;
75 yards is the longest distance event
in the Tri-Sports Day schedule. For j
long distance swimmers even 100
yards is a mere sprint, and it may be j
considered for competition.
Our point is: combine inter-col
legiate competition with longer dis
tance swimming and you will get i
more interest because the longer |
distances must be trained for.
It is too easy to swim 25 yards
without injuring anyone's health in j
competition to necessitate any i
training to speak of. Training is part j
of the game; it keeps the object in i
view; and creates sustained interest, j
SPECIAL
ATTRACTION
Helene Mayer, Olympic fencing i
champion for 1928, has been invited j
to give a demonstration on Tri- j
Sports Day. Miss Mayer is now |
studying at Mills, and it is very j
much hoped that she will come down '
with the Mills team u ind give the
contestants and spec srs a treat.
Miss Mayer referead in a recent I
fencing tourney between Stanford |
and California, having been invited !
by the latter to assist.
MUTUAL
BENEFIT
What will probably be a very in
structive and beautiful program is j
not open to the public, for here the j
principle is the most important ;
thing.
The Dance Symposium to be held j
at Berkeley November 10 is for
the mutual benefit of the partici- ;
pants, the Orchesis (dance drama) I
clubs of California, Stanford, Mills, j
College of the Pacific, the state
teachers colleges of San Jose and 1
Fresno, and the audience will be
composed of the department heads
of these schools only.
It is not a competitive affair, for J
each school will present a study in !
movement which will be performed j
by everyone. '

The rare opportunity of having r
lesson from Tina Flada, pupil oi
the Wigman School in Dresden, wil
bo had by the members of the Danct
Symposium. â€”Van Wormer.
