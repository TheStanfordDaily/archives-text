By their close victory over U.C.
L A. Friday, Nort Thornton's varsity
water poloists took the lead in the
Pacific Coast Conference standings.
The Cardinal paddlers are the only
undefeated team in the circuit, since I
the Bruins conquered California at
Berkeley Saturday, 4 to 3.
Stanford is tied for first with the ;
Olympic Club in the Northern Cali- !

land tomorrow night, with Stanford '
again highly favored.
