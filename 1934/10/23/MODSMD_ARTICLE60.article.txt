# CAMPUS OPINION
## ON CLOTHES 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
I am one of these peculiar people j
who likes to write anonymous let
ters to people like you. If my
ramblings bore you, just dump them
in the waste basket. Due to the lact
that I find it difficult to use a type
writer after I locate one, my ideas
are usually stale. It's too bad, but \
after all if I didn't type them how
could they be anonymous?
Now the campus clothes business i
is getting me down.. After reading
your editorial entitled "Moleskins, j
Frosh." I felt the urge to inquire
deeply into the subject. I fail to see
the great virtue of trousers worn;
"throughout the school year, usually i
without benefit of soap and water." J
Now of course there may be some j
fundamental idea that I, in my pres
ent state of ignorance, fail to grasp, j
but it seems to me that if Stanford
really wants "student democracy"
that there are other ways of obtain
ing it besides wearing pants that,
could stand alone.
Think of "the pristine vigor" that
Stanford men and women could ac- !
cumulate if they would be willing to j
give up having cars on the campus! j
And how about "Gripo's" idea of
letting Stanford students into all J
football games on their student body !
cards?
In tracing this trend toward i
tweeds (how's that for alliteration?)
do you think it's quite fair to insin
uate that the women are causing the
disturbance? After all, you know,
fair Harvard with her necktie, coat,
and accent is completely a man's in
stitution.
Yours,
H.A.F.
