# GERMAN PURGE CONDEMNED IN RADIO LECTURE
## Dr. Cooper Lauds Courtesy, Deplores Tragedies In Hitler's Germany 
### Virginia Johnson 
Dr. W. A. Cooper, professor emer
i itus of German, gave a fascinating
| account last night of his experiences
jin Germany last summer imme
! diately following the crisis of June
; 30. His talk "July in Germany" was
| broadcast over Station KGO at 8
I o'clock, the new time for the Stan
| ford University hour.
Dr. Cooper told the unpleasant
features of his trip first because the
"purging" of June 30 occurred the
very day he was to board the
Bremen with the other 50 members
of the Carl Schurz Association party.
Dr. Cooper said that they were in r
vited as a return courtesy for the
hospitality extended to visiting Ger
man scholars by American university
circles since the war.
Purpose of Tour
He added: "One purpose of the
tour may have been to let us see
whether or hot the intensive anti-
German campaign being waged in
our press is based on truth and
facts."
The murder of Dr. Fritz Beck,
director of the Munich branch of
the German Academic Exchange
service was a great shock to the
members of Cooper's group in Ger
many who had had dealings with
him in connection with the American
German Student Exchange and had
found him to be an excellent man
for his position. Dr. Cooper said that
he refused to subordinate the ideals
of his cultui-al office to the political
purposes of a few local politicians.
Germans Hospitable
Another case that disturbed the
group more widely was that of Dr.
Adolph Morobach, national director
of the Academic Exchange service.
It was through him that the group
had received their invitations, yet he
failed to greet them in Bremen and
again in Berlin. He was held in cus
tody throughout the length of the
tour, accused of improper activities
in another field.
The unpleasantness of these
events was atoned for by the cour
tesies of city authorities and uni
versity faculties wherever the
American party went.
Dr. Cooper said that the country
i:> as attractive and lovely for travel
as it has ever been, and accommo
dations and entertainment were
never better. "A Midsummer Night's
Dream" was presented in the huge
court of the ruins of the Heidelburg
Castle at night under the open sky.
"A more ideal setting would be
hard to conceive," said Dr. Cooper.
"The top-notch acting and dancing,
the beautiful costumes, the fairy
land lighting effects, and the con
cealed music, made it an unforget
table occasion."
Peace-Loving People
Dr. Cooper found his old German
friends the same as ever, friendly,
hearty, wholesome, peace-loving,
more interested in phases of culture
than anything else, happy over im
proved conditions, especially over
reduction of the unemployment, the
unification of the people, and the
return to hope and self-respect, but
not edified by increasing economic
isolation and their failure hitherto
to achieve the sympathy and under
standing abroad which they covet.
In closing Dr. Cooper said that
"There are more Stanford graduates
in Germany at present than I have
known about at any time in 30 years, i
Some A.B.'s, at any rate, are not j
blinded by every blotch of printer's i
ink. They think for themselves." j
