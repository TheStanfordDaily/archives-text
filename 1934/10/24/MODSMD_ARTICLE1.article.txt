give freedom of action in matters
except those conflicting with the
constitution and student policy to all
subsidiary organizations.
Amending their former by-law re
quiring all organizations to submit
their minutes for approval, the Com
mittee substituted "review" for the
word "approval," and added the pro
vision that the minutes of the coun
cils and committees must be sub
mitted for review by the next meet

Proposition Changed
At the suggestion of President
Marvie Kahn, Ex Committee changed
the proposition on Thursday's
A.S.S.U. ballot which would have
given the president power to fill all
vacancies in student offices until the
next regular election. The new
proposition will give" the president
"in consultation with Ex Commit
tee" power to fill the offices until
a special election is held.
A1 Blackman, who has been tem
porarily filling the position, was ap
pointed secretary of Ex Committee.
Under the constitution this job will
draw a salary. Ex Committee has
not fixed one yet, and Blackman in
dicated last night to the Daily that he
does not desire one.
