Are any Stanford students posses- .
sors of Gay Nineties apparel?
Wardrobe and scenery directors of
"One Sunday Afternoon," to be pre
sented November 2, were warned
that they were receiving a difficult
assignment. Recent events have
made them sure of it.
Margaret Dennis, costume mis
tress, issues a plea to anyone own
ing clothing, whether masculine or
feminine, popular in the period pre
ceding 1900, to lend same to the
wardrobe department of the play.
Something of the same difficulty
was experienced by the Hollywood
property department during the film
ing of "One Sunday Afternoon,"
which last year starred Gary Cooper.
Articles ranging from a wooden In
dian to feminine negligee of the
aforementioned period were deemed
necessary before production could
proceed.
A lightning rod, hay wagon,
champion horse-shoe pitchers, a
trained horse-fly, men with natural

handle-bar whiskers, albums show
ing the various types of beards worn
in 1900—all these and even more
queer objects were the object of
feverish searches by Hollywood
moguls.
After a two - month intensive
search for a wooden Indian, the stu
dio found only twelve in the entire
United States and Canada. Four
were reported from Canada. One was
finally k>cated in eastern California
which filled studio specifications.
An Edison cylindrical grapho
phone, a stereoscope with assorted
slides, and a half dozen tobacco
chewers adept at whittling were also
needed.
Stage production, explain dramatic
heads, does not require the detail
so imperative in a movie. The
.trained horse-fly, natural betfrds,
and oilier oddities considered indis
pensable in Hollywood will not be
used on the Assembly Hall stage.
"But," query wardrobe officials,
"haven't you any Gay Nineties cos
tumes?"
