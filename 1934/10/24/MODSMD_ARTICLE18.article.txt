# Big Game Blaze May Illuminate Stanford Farm
## Thursday's Election Will Determine Final Fate Of Annual Pyre 
### 
A revival of the Big Game bon- |
(ire for 1934 loomed last night a.s the j
Ex Committee bound over the fire
question for student vote at the gen
eral student body election tomorrow.
Sponsored by the Rally Commit
tee and Wqmen's Committee, the
proposition was placed before the
executive group backed by a peti
tion of 300 names. As stated, the
proposition cails for a fire built the
day it is ignited at a cost, under $100.
Cost Was Objection
The chief objection to the bonfire
in the past was the cost and the
time taken building it. The last,
which was built in 1932 by the class
of '36, cost over $700 and caused
workers to practically abandon their
classes for the three days which it
took to build it.
Abandoning the project was ini
tiated by the faculty with those ob
jections foremost in their minds. The
Ex Committee of that year pounded
by both the press and the professors,
was quick to respond.
Objections Eliminated
Plans for the present bonfire take
in consideration all of the objections
registered. A Palo Alto resident-,
Mark Nesbitt, has volunteered the
timber on some twenty acres of land
he owns at La Honda for the bulk of
the fire. The outside posts can be
obtained from the telephone com
pany gratis and the Southern Pa
cific Company-is willing to give old
railway ties to help the project along,
according to the sponsors. That
leaves only the transportation of the
brush and timber and the petro
leum used to be considered. The
committee in charge of the investiga
tion of the feasibility of the plan has
secured the latter at a reduced cost.
The petition which has been cir
culated carries a provision that it be
b\iilt in one day and burned at the
Big Game rally that same night.
This dispenses with the elaborate
guard s3'stem and the undue con
struction time to which the faculty
objected.
Faculty Approves
Faculty approval of the present
plan was assured yesterday as Regis
trar Mitchell announced his approval
of the scheme. President Wilbur saw
nothing wrong with it, according to
the committee which interviewed
him before he left for the Chicago
educational convention. So far the
only definite opposition has come
from John Lyman, head sponsor of
Encina.
Differing from past years, this bon
fire will be more nearly the product
of the combined effort of the entire
University than any of the past,
though the class of '38 will bear the
bulk of the project, as has been the
custom of all the previous freshmen
classes.
