# CARD REGULARS TO START TILT WITH TROJANS
## Topping, Adams, Head In Line-Up; Alustiza Has Leg Bruise 
### Millard Browne 
The Stanford Indians hereby issue :
two promises:
They will have their best possible
football team on the field when they
meet U.S.C., the once-mighty Tro
jans, Saturday.
They also will have a smoothly
clicking, spirited Cardinal team
which actually lives up to its poten
tialities.
And if Stanford lives up to those
two promises, which she seems to
have every inclination of doing,
Howard Jones and all the boys from
the southland will be made utterly
miserable as the shadows lengthen
over Stanford Stadium.
Sick List Dwindling
The sick list has been dwindling
fast and finally has reached a van
ishing point. Keith Topping, Woody
Adams, and Gordy Head are once
more only memories to the Stanford
hospital nurses, and the honest-to
goodness first string is once again
running through plays as a unit. . ;
Frankie Alustiza is the only squad
member temporarily laid up, and his |
injury, a mere leg bruise, will be well
in plenty of time for Saturday's
game. He attended practice last
night, but did not take part in heavy
work.
Familiar Line-Up
So Saturday's line-up will look
quite familiar, unless something de
cidedly uncalled-for happens in
practice this week.
It will include Monk Moscrip and
Topping at the flanks, Claude Cal
laway and Bob Reynolds as tackles,
Adams and Larry Rouble at the
! guard positions, and Wes Muller,
center. The backfield will offer the
quadruple threat of Alustiza, Bones
Hamilton, Bobby Grayson, and Buck
Van Dellen.
Stanford Will Click
Stanford will click Saturday. Be
cause Stanford has fully demon
strated its ability to click when it
wants to, and because Stanford has
been wanting to click against U.S.C.
since practice opened six weeks ago,
that statement is almost as certain as
if it were court testimony.
Nine of the eleven probable In
dian starters are among those who,
as freshmen two years ago, made
that much publicized oath that Stan
ford would not lose to Troy in foot
ball as long as they were in college.
They kept that agreement last year,
and have no intention of not doing so
this season.
If El Trojan plays for 00 full min
utes as he has in one and two
minute spurts off and on this year,
the game will be close one way or
another, but if the Trojans fail to
show more than they have against
other opposition, a score of three
touchdowns and up is very prob
able.
