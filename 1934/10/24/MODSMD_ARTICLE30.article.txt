# Important Propositions For Campus Consideration
## 
### 
From eight o'clock until after noon today,
Daily election oilieials will conduct a secret,
unofficial poll of the campus in an effort to
learn just how Stanford people stand on four
questions. Results will be compiled from
faculty und students, in two separate tallies.
Questions deal with two distinct fields,
hearing no direct relation to each other, hut
of real interest to Daily readers. Clip the
ballot from the adjoining column, and drop
il in the ballot box this morning.

Up for A.S.S.U. consideration in tomorrow's
special election tire three important matters.
The selection of two responsible, conscientious
men to lill Men's Council vacancies is obvi
ously necessary.
Should the A.S.S.U. president be empowered
to make temporary appointments to lill va
cancies until such time as a special election
can be called? Emergencies do arise, when the
immediate situation demands action, and no
action is forthcoming, because present con
stitutional limitations do not include author
ity for temporary appointments. At most,
such a selection would he for a period of less
than three weeks.

The Big Came Bonfire.
For long, it has been a debatable proposi
tion. Last year a freshman class was told that
other things were more worth while, and Slan
lonl had a Big Came rally, and played a Big
Came, but an intangible something was lack
ing. Anybody who lias ever been close to a
Big Came bonfire has experienced the thrill
of that warm and friendly feeling, the mass
enthusiasm while all breathe deeply of the
crackling, smoke-laden air. The Indians were
on the war path.
Arguments there are, legitimately so,
against the bonfire as it has been handled in
the past, with the week of wear and tear on
the freshman class. Ex Committee last night
went on record as favoring a Big Came bonfire
for 1934, to be arranged for in advance and
built in one day with the entire student body
turning out in one day of fun and labor on
the afternoon preceding the rally.
It will be on the ballot tomorrow. Would
ijou care to see that blaze llare to the skies
spelling the doom of Poor Cal once more?
Yole.
