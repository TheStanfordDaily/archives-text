When junior high school students "swipe"
public property and deposit it in their respec
tive bedrooms, that's not news. Many a road
sign, telephone* insulator, and red lantern
reposes on the bureaus of hundreds of young
sters throughout the world.
Isnl when university students, and particu
larly Stanford students, become suddenh ju
venile and sloop to such things it is truly
remarkable. The childishness is attributed
by police to fraternity initiates on their "Hell
Week" quests, and to h*»ll men as well.
Last week, within the space of twenty
minutes, ten red lanterns disappeared from
the sides of a dangerous ditch on a road near
Lagunita Court, leaving the road dark and
the ditch a certain trap for any unwary
driver.
Last night the theft of sir very large signs
was discovered. These boards labeled as
"Dangerous bill Passable" several roads now
under construction 011 the campus, and their
removal left any stranger who passed the in
at night totally ignorant of the chuck-holes
and ruts lying beyond the pavement. One
such sign reposes tonight in a well-known
sorority. And the girls (Stanford women)
laugh.
Mr. Sign-Collector, you may cause another
to lose his life by such juvenile actions. You
make yourself liable to line and imprisonment

if signs or lanterns are found in your posses
sion. Is il worth it?
The Corporation Yard, custodians of Uni
versity property, will accept without ques
tion the return of signs and lanterns. Shall
we grow up and he Stanford men and not
"college hoys"?
