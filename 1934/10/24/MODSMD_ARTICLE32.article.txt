Last week sit l)e Pauw University, Sigma
Delta Chi, a professional .journalism frater
nity, celebrated its twenty-fifth anniversary.
To the outsider, il must-have heen another
amazing fact of this curious profession,
where men in their maturity, the leading edi
tors and publishers of America, cast oil' their
editorial cares and went down to Indiana to
nih shoulders with a group of undergraduates.
These men took oil' their coats and sat down
with the raw material of the newspaper craft,
debated, fought, argued, and wrestled with
the common problems for three days. In no
other profession could such a spectacle exist.
Consider, if you can, Chief Justice Hughes of
the Supreme Court mulling the fine subtleties
of constitutional law with a 22-year-old law
student, or the Mayo Brothers arguing, give
and take, on cancer, with an obscure interne.
And you will get a comparative picture of
what happened at De Pauw.
Such a force in American journalism should
inspire a stinging rebuke for those critics
who, rummaging in the cesspools of newscraft
and finding there nothing but scandal mon
gering and graft and falsehood, choose to
insist that the American newspaper has gone
to pot.
