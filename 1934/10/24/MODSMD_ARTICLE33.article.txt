The Daily hasn't shouted to the high heav
ens this year about Stanford's 1934 Big Red
Machine, that rolling mass of power that is
able to produce results when necessary; one,
three, six points nt a crack.
Other institutions have found it expedient
to tell everybody just what's wrong with
everything. Berkeley and Trov have had it
out in the news columns. Stanford, we find,
is ;i pretty swell (yes) place, and the fact that
we have one of the best ball clubs in the
country is too obvious lor comment.
Yes, Tiny, and your Indian varsityâ€”the
campus is proud of you both. You know it,
we're all happy, and darned if we can find
a thing to complain about.
