### CEDRIC LARSON 
WITH THOMAS S. BARCLAY
Political stalking horses are abroad galore these late
October, pre-election days, and the nearing November
poll-test of New Deal policies carries with it more than
a usual amount of interest.
The national administration has been besieged by
great numbers of aspiring state politicians hopeful of
Roosevelt endorsement. The Washington administra
tion has, for the most part, adroitly side-stepped these
efforts, preferring, in California and elsewhere, to let
the voters of the respective states make their own local
choices.
A last-minute news flash from New York re
veals that in the Literary Digest straw vote of Up
ton Sinclair's possibilities of being elected Cali
fornia's governor there is a strong sentiment against
the Socialist writer. Although no authentic figures
have been released, reports from Wall Street indi
cate a 3 to 1 sentiment against Sinclair's election.
George Creel, who was defeated in the August
primary by Sinclair for Democratic gubernatorial
nomination, left last night for California from
Washington, with the avowed intention of ascer
taining Sinclair's political stand. Creel stated that
he understood the Democratic platform finally
agreed upon excluded EPIC (end poverty in Cali
fornia) projects of Sinclair. The former western
NKA chief said he was coming to California to
"assess the situation."
Dr. S. Barclay, expert in national politics,
believes after a statistical analysis of past and present
political trends, that the Democrats will lose probably
not more than 50 seats in the house of representatives,
which will leave them an ample working majority. At
present, of the 435 house members, 310 are Democrats
and 117 Republicans. Since there are now 60 Demo
crats and 35 Republicans in the Senate, there is no
possibility whatever of the Democrats losing control
of this branch of Congress.
"In my opinion the Republican campaign this year
has not been effective," Dr. Barclay observes. "It has
no unity behind it, and perhaps no attractive alterna
tive to offer to what is called the average voter. Repub
licans are no doubt justified in pointing out possible
dangers of the future, but this is not a potent argument
with people living wholly in the present. There is also
disagreement among Republican party leaders and
managers over their attitude toward the New Deal."
Professor Barclay points out some unusual fea
tures of the present political campaign taken as a
whole. In some states the interest in the outcome
is intense, as in California; in other states there is
hardly a ripple of excitement. Radio is playing an
increasingly important role in politics, and well
timed "speech-casting" is now becoming a political
weapon of major importance—a weapon, by the
way. which President Roosevelt wields with dex
terity.
"Surprising to me in November's election," con
cludes Dr. Barclay, "is the fact that in view of the many
pressing problems now confronting the American finan
cial interests, politics this fall has been relegated by
them to a secondary position."
Dr. Barclay during the past year has been in Wash
ington, D.C., studying national politics at close range
and plans in the future to publish a book on the
speakership.

which will leave them an ample working majority. At
present, of the 435 house members, 310 are Democrats
and 117 Republicans. Since there are now 60 Demo
crats and 35 Republicans in the Senate, there is no
possibility whatever of the Democrats losing control
of this branch of Congress.
"In my opinion the Republican campaign this year
has not been effective," Dr. Barclay observes. "It has
no unity behind it, and perhaps no attractive alterna
tive to offer to what is called the average voter. Repub
licans are no doubt justified in pointing out possible
dangers of the future, but this is not a potent argument
with people living wholly in the present. There is also
disagreement among Republican party leaders and
managers over their attitude toward the New Deal."
Professor Barclay points out some unusual fea
tures of the present political campaign taken as a
whole. In some states the interest in the outcome
is intense, as in California; in other states there is
hardly a ripple of excitement. Radio is playing an
increasingly important role in politics, and well
timed "speech-casting" is now becoming a political
weapon of major importance—a weapon, by the
way. which President Roosevelt wields with dex
terity.
"Surprising to me in November's election," con
cludes Dr. Barclay, "is the fact that in view of the many
pressing problems now confronting the American finan
cial interests, politics this fall has been relegated by
them to a secondary position."
Dr. Barclay during the past year has been in Wash
ington, D.C., studying national politics at close range
and plans in the future to publish a book on the
speakership.
WITH THOMAS S. BARCLAY
Political stalking horses are abroad galore these late
October, pre-election days, and the nearing November
poll-test of New Deal policies carries with it more than
a usual amount of interest.
The national administration has been besieged by
great numbers of aspiring state politicians hopeful of
Roosevelt endorsement. The Washington administra
tion has, for the most part, adroitly side-stepped these
efforts, preferring, in California and elsewhere, to let
the voters of the respective states make their own local
choices.
A last-minute news flash from New York re
veals that in the Literary Digest straw vote of Up
ton Sinclair's possibilities of being elected Cali
fornia's governor there is a strong sentiment against
the Socialist writer. Although no authentic figures
have been released, reports from Wall Street indi
cate a 3 to 1 sentiment against Sinclair's election.
George Creel, who was defeated in the August
primary by Sinclair for Democratic gubernatorial
nomination, left last night for California from
Washington, with the avowed intention of ascer
taining Sinclair's political stand. Creel stated that
he understood the Democratic platform finally
agreed upon excluded EPIC (end poverty in Cali
fornia) projects of Sinclair. The former western
NKA chief said he was coming to California to
"assess the situation."
Dr. S. Barclay, expert in national politics,
believes after a statistical analysis of past and present
political trends, that the Democrats will lose probably
not more than 50 seats in the house of representatives,
which will leave them an ample working majority. At
present, of the 435 house members, 310 are Democrats
and 117 Republicans. Since there are now 60 Demo
crats and 35 Republicans in the Senate, there is no
possibility whatever of the Democrats losing control
