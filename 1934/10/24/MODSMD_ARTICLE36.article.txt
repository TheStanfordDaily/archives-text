# BULL SESSION
## MONEY, MONEY, MONEY 
### 
For years charges of "profes
sionalism" have been bantered back
and forth across the stadia of the
nation. Those who could not play
Icotball, and did not care to root
at football could at least
shout "corruption." As in the ease
of politics, "corruption" is one of ihe
things that has kept collegiate foot
ball in the public prints.
There are two ways of stopping
all this business. One is to end the
"corruption" by taking the money
completely out of athletic contests.
This has been tried over and over
again. And it has failed miserably.
The last man who wi'ote a book: "I,
John Doke, and How I Ended Cor
ruption in Football" is now resting
easily in a padded cell at Agnew. As
long as there are people who are
willing to pack giant coloseums
singing "That's How the Money
Goes; Pop Goes the Weasel," there
will be money in football and other
sports. As long as there is money,
there will be "corruption." That is
as certain as original sin.
The other way out has been sug
gested editorially. "Corruption'
(printer, don't forget those quotes)
can be stopped, or at least throttled
down, by making it legal and open.
The use of money, like the use of
alcohol, can be better regulated when
it is legal, than when it is illegal.
Aside from being what is appar
ently the only practicable solution to
the problem, payment of athletes is
"just" viewed from present-day uni
versity standards. At a University
where dance decorators, editors, and
business managers of all sorts are
all paid, it is a little difficult to see
the objection to paying athletes,
who work longer — and bring in
more money.
Most people realize that high
powered athletes must be paid. Thus
at least 19 of the stars of Stanford's
1932-33 Big Red Machine received
scholarships. Those who did not
receive scholarships or other reward
were plainly being discriminated
against. And upon the head of the
B.A.C. and Stanford's athletic big
wigs may rest the charge that they
were attempting to beat down honest
labor.
The athletic investment is too
great to be fiddled with. The income
is too large, the profits too dear to
be jeopardized. For Stanford not to

| pay its athletes is to dance along the
brink of economic suicide. For the
j Coast Conference to join in a con
! spiracy to outlaw "professionalism"
| is obviously an open breech of the
i Sherman Anti-Trust laws.
True, with open payment of ath
! letes, there might not accrue to our
| gridiron greats that obeisance of the
| masses, which traditionally belongs
jto college athletic heroes. But that
| is too bad. We've got to pay off the
! Branner mortgage.
