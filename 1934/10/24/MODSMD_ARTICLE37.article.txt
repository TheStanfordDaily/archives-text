"THERE'S ALWAYS TOMORROW"
At the Varsity Theater
Binnie Barnes, the much-publi
cized English star, is handicapped in
J her debut by an Irene Dunne-like
role. Frank Morgan is a "forgotten
husband," ignored by his wife and a

selfish family. A
complacent,
middle - aged
love affair en
sues with Miss
Barnes of suf
ficent potency to
snap the home
folks out of it

I and make them reappreciate Daddy,
and send the menace unhappily
'on her way. The picture is slow.
; but pleasantly innocuous domestic
i drama.
