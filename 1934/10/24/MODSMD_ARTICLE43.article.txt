BIG FOUR MEMBERS
ALL HAVE IDEAS
Be it known that:
Jimmy Phelan and his Wash
ington Huskies would rather heat
California than anyone else this
year.
But Jimmy Phelan chose to
scout Stanford last Saturday and
leave the task of watching Cali
fornia up to an assistant.
Howard Jones would much pre
fer winning from Stanford to heat
ing any or all of his other op
ponents.
Bill Ingram wants to heat Wash
ington, Stanford, and S.C., or any
one of these.
Tiny Thornhill also wants, and
thinks he can, heat the Huskies,
Bears, and Trojans, hut he fears
each, and ahout equally.
So it's all a vicious circle.
That's all quite evident, and hardly
worth calling attention to, except
that there are a few little things
about these astounding statements
that beg explanation.
PERSONNEL OF
BIG FOUR CHANGED
The most significant of these fac
tors is that Washington is installed
this year as a member of the "Big
Four." For years California, Stan
ford, and U.S.C. have pointed for
each other athletically.
But this season the Huskies, .since
they are playing each of the other
three, and since they are one of the
two undefeated major teams, Phe
lan's squad is taken as a full
fledged member of the big quartet.
"Remember last year, Califor
nia 33, Washington 0," is the es
sence of placards reported strewn
about the dressing rooms of the
Seattle Huskies. Coach PJielan
doesn't like California anyway,
and he is preparing to show In
gram and Co. an interesting, if
not profitable, afternoon in the
northland.
So Washington wants to beat Cali
fornia. But to the exclusion oi
everything else? 'Tain't so, even if
that is the impression some of the
boys are trying to get.
No, sir. "Big Ten Jimmy" has
other ideas of what he will do with
his three backfield wizards and eight
other middlin' fair football players.
HUSKIES DREAM
OR ROSE BOWL
Stanford takes second place in ihe
Husky thoughts, and Pasadena is
third. For the first time in years
Washington is toying with the possi
bility of a Seattle migration to the
Rose Bowl. In reaching that goal
Washington will have to beat Stan
ford. There is no malice in Phelan's
intention of humbling Thornhill's
Indians in a couple of weeks. But
as long as it must be done, Jimmy
thinks he would sincerely enjoy it.
Jones of Troy is probably do
ing more heavy pointing than any
other coach on the Coast. And his
pointing is directed straight at
the Cardinals. He will worry about
California and Washington after
the Stanford game is history.
California's spot is similar to that
of the Indians. The Bears can't af
ford to point for Stanford or U.S.C.
yet. But the reason for the similarity
is different. Stanford is on top, and
must stay on top week by week.
California, however, has lost a
game this year, and alumni are
bowling for her to win each game.

Ingram, then, must begin worrying l
about Washington, then start con
centrating on Troy, and last of all,
prepare for Stanford.
