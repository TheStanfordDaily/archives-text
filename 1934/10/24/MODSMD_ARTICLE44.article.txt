# YEARLINGS READY FOR BATTLE WITH S.C. FROSH TEAM
## Bob Dakan, Regular End, Is Out with Head Injury; Others in Shape 
### 
Polishing up some of the more in
: tricate plays and adding some new
. ones, frosh gridders last night added
i i little finesse which will be helpful j
| in the important S.C. frosh game Sal- j
urday.
The squad is at present free from i
j casualties with the exception of Bob
| Dakan, regular end, who is on the '
table with a head injury sustained in j
the San Mateo game Saturday. Coach |
, Bradshaw is uncertain as to whether i
, the solid flankman will be able to |
! rough it by Saturday. Glenn Ham- 1
' ilton, full, has a quantity of tape over j
i his face, but nothing serious.
Coach Bradshaw lined up a Team
A yesterday to run through the new
plays thusly: Layer (168) and Stone :
(180), encls; Henningsen (200) and .
Bell (212), tackles; McKinney (183) |
and Holdridge (170), guards; and |
Heath (186), center. In the backfield i
were Gillette (181), quarter; Coflis |
(170) and Collins .(175), halves; and j
Paulman <180), full.
This is the generally recognized
first-string line-up, with a few ex- j
ceptions. Partrid# (183) alternates
with McKinney, Oberg (175) usually
starts at tackle, and Roberts (180) j
and Hamilton (188) see plenty of ac- i
tion at quarter and full, respectively, j
Some of the underhand-forward- j
laterals Bradshaw gave the team last I
night looked good for substantial !
gains. These last give the Frosh a j
widely varying attack, with possi- !
bilities of a line thrust, a long or i
short pass, end run, or quick kick j
from one formation.. Bill Paulman |
still gets off some remarkably long
and well-placed kicks.
