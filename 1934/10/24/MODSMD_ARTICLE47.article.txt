Something novel in the way of
scoring, a safety for each team, fea
tured the 14 to 9 victory of Sequoia I
over Chi Psi yesterday, in intramural
touch-football competition which
also saw the Fijis blank Delta Chi
13 to 0, and Sigma Chi swamp Sigma
Nu II 38 to. 0. A default by Kappa
Alpha put Zeta Psi in the win col
umn also.
Harry Goff, Bill Ladue, and How
ard Russell supplied Sequoia with
their points, getting a jump of 14 be
fore Chi Psi got under way. GofT's
nailing a Chi Psi man behind his own
goal gave 2 points at the start; while
two passes, Ladue on the throwing
end of both, with Russell catching
the first and Goff the second, sealed

Sequoia's threats.
Starting the second half, Howard |
Clark intercepted Sequoia's pass and
ran 30 yards for the first Chi Psi '
score. Bill Trego converted; and
Edmund Mac Donald blocked Se- i
quoia's kick soon after, the ball roll
ing beyond the end zone for two;
more Chi Psi points, running the
total to 9. Neither team scored in the
intense final minutes.
Passes, George Serfass to Howard !
Campen, and Serfass to Edmund i
Riggins, turned the tide in favor of
the Fijis over Delta Chi. Both re- i
suited in touchdowns, and AI Davis !
