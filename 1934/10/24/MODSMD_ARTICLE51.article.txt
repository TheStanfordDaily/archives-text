# WATER POLO TEAM TO MEET LAKESIDE
## 
### 
In search of their second league
victory, the Card varsity water po
loists will tangle again with the
Lakeside Swimming Club in Oak
land tonight. Last week the Indians
easily whipped the transbay team,
8 to 0, but in their own pool, Ihe
Lakeside plunge, the Oaklanders
may be tougher.
Stanford hopes to use the Lake
side game to polish off her smash
ing Hungarian-American offense in
preparation for the Trojan invasion
of Encina pools Saturday morning.
Coach Nort Thornton will take four
full teams to Oakland, and will try
to size up his reserves by using â€¢as
many players as the score permits.
A junior varsity game will follow
the contest between the regulars,
which is scheduled to start at 8:30
p.m. The Cardinal jayvees won by
a 9-4 margin in the first game here,
and should defeat their rivals again.
Saturday morning at 11 o'clock in
Encina pools Stanford and U.S.C.
will meet again, with the Indians
out for revenge. The last time the
Cards played the Trojans was in
the spring t>f 1933, when the south
erners won and became the last team
to defeat Stanford. This year's S.C.
paddlers are known to be .fast.
The Cardinal line-up for the Lake
side game will be as follows: sprint,
Vlad Taranik; forwards, Leo Cook
and Bill Clemo or Bob Foster; cen
ter back, Wally Wiget; guards, Bill
Woodard and Jim Benet; and goalie,
Bob Haslacher.
De Pauw University of Chicago
will be host to members of the Na
tional College Press Association at
the annual convention.
