the Trojans a little further down (he
conference ladder and Washington a |
slight favorite over California at I
Seattle.
The Husky-Bear tilt in the north j
may go a long way toward deciding ;
the Pacific Coast Conference cham
pion as Washington is as yet unde
feated and California has won its j
only conference game. Washington >
State, tied with the Huskies at the ■
top of the standings, meets Oregon |
State, which tied U.S.C. last week j
although it is said that the Trojans !
were keeping much under cover in |
preparation for their big game with !
Stanford.
