### 
The Editor, Sir:
Is Stanford maintaining its past,
t high cultural standards? Are the
.students very much concerned about
the activities they sponsor, as a
whole? Is the student body fulfilling
its obligations to the University? In
the light of the student support of
the Concert Series the grim answer
is "No!"
The season ticket sale this year
is the lowest it has ever been in the
nine-year history of the series! Per
haps the greatest and most unjusti
fied reason for this disgrace is the
fact that the Stanford Band, Glee
Club, and Symphony Orchestra are
appearing on the series, 'fhat ihey
are doing so should be all the more
| reason that the students should sup
port them. The object in putting
these three musical organizations
| on the series, in the first place was
1 not to produce an artistically per
i feet combination but to create
, greater support and interest in Stan
j ford musical activities.
It seems to me that the students
! should at least uphold their own
1 Concert Series, an organization
' which they themselves sponsor.
Each student owes it to himself, to
, the Associated Students, and to the
: University to do so.
Yours,
Norman Barnes
