# CARD FENCERS WILL MEET ITALIAN CLUB IN COMPETITION FOR TITLEHOLDER TROPHY
## 
### 
Varsity fencers, led by Captain'
Jerry Bowen, will journey to San
Francisco this week-end to meet the
Uniona Sportiva Italiana, Italian
fencing club, in the third of five
matches in competition for the Heron
trophy. The meet will be held Fri
day night at the Italian Club's gym
nasium.
Though they have dropped their
first two starts by close scores to the
East Buy Fencing Club and Funke
Fencing Academy on successive Fri
days, the local foilsmen are in third
place for the trophy on the basis of
number of individual matches won.
This is possible through the close
ness of meet scores, it was explained,
as last week's total was 13 to 12.
Olympic Club, defending title
holder, is in the lead for the trophy
which is presented annually to the
best five-man team in the Bay divi
sion of the Amateur Fencers' League.
Of some consolation to the Card
aggregation is the fact that their
traditional rivals from Berkeley are
in the cellar position. California trails
in the number of matches won and
lost, not on the total of meets won.
Members of the team are still op
timistic regarding their ability to
take the rest of the Heron meets, in

spite of the greenness and inexpe- j
rience of the team members. Captain 1
Bowen is the only regular with any ]
foils experience, though the first j
three members are good, Coach j
Bugge said.
In order to help bring up the cali- j
bre of the fencers, Coach Harry Ma
loney, director of minor sports, has '
decided to devote two days a week |
to help in the coaching of the team. ;
