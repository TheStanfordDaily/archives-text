# CARDS SPIRITED IN TOUGH DRILL FOR S.C. GAME
## Varsity Shows Precision In Bucks, Passes During Long Scrimmage STANFORD CONFIDENT Timing Only Thing Missing In Trojan Attack 
### Millard Browne 
They'll keep 'cm up in the air.
They'll trample 'em under foot.
They'll run 'em ragged and leave
the ends all frayed.
These are .some of the things Tiny
Thornhill and all his Indians are
storing up for Howard Jones and the
frantically struggling but slowly
sinking Trojans from Los Angeles
town.
Those three things and a few
more were brought out doubly
strong in a long, tiring scrimmage
last night. And they were demon
strated by a Stanford.varsity that
so far this year has shown 110 life
whatsoever in practice scrimmages.
All of which shows .besides a di
versified and strong Indian attack,
that Stanford's football players are
all deeply interested, to express it
mildly, in pushing dear old Troy
about the Stanford Stadium Satur
day afternoon.
Show Aerial Strength
Even in passing, the depart/nent
where the Cards have looked their
worst in practice, the eleven regulars
overwhelmed second and third
string players. On three occasions
Bobby Grayson flipped tosses to
Monk Moscrip which netted touch
downs.
Stanford has every intention of
opening up Saturday in a display
of line plunging, end running,
fancy reverses, and forward and
lateral passes, and the Indians will
show things they have not yet
hinted at in five early season
games.
Everyone, including the Cardinal
football players, has an idea the
Redskins will whip Troy Saturday.
But the Cards aren't being carried
away with the idea. They are
merely self-confident, not over
confident.
Not Over-Confident
They are among the few that are
fully aware U.S.C. is not as feeble
and totally unpretentious as How
ard Jones and his Hollywood Stars
are trying to make the gullible be
lieve.
Troy's 1934 record may mean
something, but there are certain
facts and indications that must be
faced:
1. U.S.C. still has Irvine "Cot
ton" Warburton, all-American
from his toes up. He got awaj for
one touchdown last year against
Stanford.
2. Southern California has plenty
of material, and this material can
play football. Jones himself said
"The material is here, the rest is a
coaching problem." And Jones is di
recting that coaching.
Work on Timing
3. All that has been lacking is that
split-second timing that makes an
attack click, according to Murray
Cuddeback, who has. scouted Troy
twice this year. Jones has been
working on that timing, and it has
slowly been rounding into shape. For
the first seven minutes of the Trojan-
Oregon Slate game last week the
southerners ran as smoothly as the
Troy of two years ago.
4. It was Stanford that elim
inated U.S.C. from the Coast
championship last season, and
Southern California is all steamed
up over this little party Saturday.
Stanford will match the fiery Tro
jans with a little flicker of her own.
And with nearly all of the hard
practice over, the Indians are en
tirely free from injuries which
would slow up their attack.
Woody Adams and Keith Topping,
two f)f the most uncertain portions
of- the once-injured list, withstood
scrimmage satisfactorily and both
will start. Frank Alustiza was out
last night but did not participate in
heavy work, and his first substitute,
Stan Anderson, was still in the hos
pital with a slight cold. Both will be
ready for work Saturday, however, i

These are .some of the things Tiny
Thornhill and all his Indians are
storing up for Howard Jones and the
frantically struggling but slowly
sinking Trojans from Los Angeles
town.
Those three things and a few
more were brought out doubly
strong in a long, tiring scrimmage
last night. And they were demon
strated by a Stanford.varsity that
so far this year has shown 110 life
whatsoever in practice scrimmages.
All of which shows .besides a di
versified and strong Indian attack,
that Stanford's football players are
all deeply interested, to express it
mildly, in pushing dear old Troy
about the Stanford Stadium Satur
day afternoon.
Show Aerial Strength
Even in passing, the depart/nent
where the Cards have looked their
worst in practice, the eleven regulars
overwhelmed second and third
string players. On three occasions
Bobby Grayson flipped tosses to
Monk Moscrip which netted touch
downs.
Stanford has every intention of
opening up Saturday in a display
of line plunging, end running,
fancy reverses, and forward and
lateral passes, and the Indians will
show things they have not yet
hinted at in five early season
games.
Everyone, including the Cardinal
football players, has an idea the
Redskins will whip Troy Saturday.
But the Cards aren't being carried
away with the idea. They are
merely self-confident, not over
confident.
Not Over-Confident
They are among the few that are
fully aware U.S.C. is not as feeble
and totally unpretentious as How
ard Jones and his Hollywood Stars
are trying to make the gullible be
lieve.
Troy's 1934 record may mean
something, but there are certain
facts and indications that must be
faced:
1. U.S.C. still has Irvine "Cot
ton" Warburton, all-American
from his toes up. He got awaj for
one touchdown last year against
Stanford.
2. Southern California has plenty
of material, and this material can
play football. Jones himself said
"The material is here, the rest is a
coaching problem." And Jones is di
recting that coaching.
Work on Timing
3. All that has been lacking is that
split-second timing that makes an
attack click, according to Murray
Cuddeback, who has. scouted Troy
twice this year. Jones has been
working on that timing, and it has
slowly been rounding into shape. For
the first seven minutes of the Trojan-
Oregon Slate game last week the
southerners ran as smoothly as the
Troy of two years ago.
4. It was Stanford that elim
inated U.S.C. from the Coast
championship last season, and
Southern California is all steamed
up over this little party Saturday.
Stanford will match the fiery Tro
jans with a little flicker of her own.
And with nearly all of the hard
practice over, the Indians are en
tirely free from injuries which
would slow up their attack.
Woody Adams and Keith Topping,
two f)f the most uncertain portions
of- the once-injured list, withstood
scrimmage satisfactorily and both
will start. Frank Alustiza was out
last night but did not participate in
heavy work, and his first substitute,
Stan Anderson, was still in the hos
pital with a slight cold. Both will be
ready for work Saturday, however, i
They'll keep 'cm up in the air.
They'll trample 'em under foot.
They'll run 'em ragged and leave
the ends all frayed.
