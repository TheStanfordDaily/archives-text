# ROW FINANCES PROVED LIQUID
## Only 3 of 24 Houses Show Debt of Past Years 
### 
V/ith only three out of 24 houses
showing a balance of red, Stanford
fraternities have started the year in
the best financial condition they
have ever experienced.
This announcement, by Chairman
Gordon Mallatratt of the Finance
Committee of the Interfraternity
Council, was made following the re
cent completion of a survey of the
standing of all houses by the com
mittee.
Not many years ago a majority of
the fraternities on the campus wore
in bad financial condition, and were
getting no better rapidly. Of the
three that show a deficit on their
October statements, none are con
sidered to be in bad condition, the
debts all being those accumulated
years ago and being rapidly paid off
by these houses.
Credit for the recent improvement
is due, declared Malattratt, to the
plan adopted by the fraternities two
years ago, by which all accounts are
supervised by Warren Turner, in
terfraternity auditor. Since the in
ception of this plan no debts have
accumulated in any house.
The Interfraternity Finance Com
mittee consists of Gordon Malatrait;
Jud Crary, president of the Palo
Alto National Bank; Jake Bults;
Warren Turner; and Interfraternity
President George Cobb (ex officio).
