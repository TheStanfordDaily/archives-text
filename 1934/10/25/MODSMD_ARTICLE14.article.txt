# Ceremonies Mark First Fires in Lagunita Hall
## 
### 
Pajama-clad Lagunitans watched
flames climbing higher and higher
last night!
But everything was under con
trol. Open fireplaces in the social
rooms were being initiated. The
ceremony started at 10 o'clock.
Residents of each of the four divi
sions gathered before their particular
hearth, and sang and cheered as the
casa officers piled the logs and
lighted the fires.
Watching the flames heighten, the
girls munched red apples — some,
cheering in unconscious imitation of
Indian fire dances; others, remain
ing pensive and properly impressed.
Corn was popped over burning
coals—and the celebration was at an
end.
