# Goodwill Visit to Japan Success, Say Students
## 
### Charlotte Burridge 
Triumph of a Japanese-American j
! friendship plan originated by four
j Japanese university students was j
i realized during the past summer |
when 90 United States students were
guests of Japan and attended a
good-will conference in Tokyo.
Nonabel Metzger, Helen Zimmer-
I man, Ruth Hunter, Arthur Wright,
and Elizabeth Sinclair were the
Stanford representatives choscn for'
their interest in the Far East.
Students in Native Homes
From the time of their arrival in
Yokohama, July 11, to their de- j
parture for the homeland, the stu
dents were guests of the Japanese, I
I and while in Tokyo lived in native l
! homes.
Elizabeth Sinclair was particularly |
fortunate in having as her host and
hostess Baron and Baroness Togo,
who are intimate members of the
royal family.
When first proposed by the Japa
nese boys enthusiastically working:
(tor international good-will, the plan i

was criticized, for it was believed
that only one phase of the nation
would be presented to the American
visitors.
Attended Conference
Such was not the case, affirm the
Stanford delegates. They attended a
conference from July 14 to 20, then
were left free to travel where they
chose. All were pleasantly impressed
with the nation and left, with the
impression that the youth of Japan
at least were making a definite ef
fort toward world peace.
Because of the outrages and dis
respectful antics of students of float
ing universities and adventure-seek
ing boys, the United States delegates
were partciularly careful to recog
nize Japanese traditions.
The students had their share of
adventure while traveling. Harbin,
near the Chinese border, was par
ticularly thrilling, as it was neces
sary to carry .small knives for pro
tection. At another time the group
was hold up throe days because of
bubonic plague.
