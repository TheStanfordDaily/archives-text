# Trials Today In Gaieties
## 
### 
Final choice of chorines for the
1934 Big Game Gaieties will be
made following this afternoon's try
outs, which are to be held in the
Old Roble Gym from 3 to 5 o'clock.
All University women, freshmen
excepted, are eligible for a part in
the production. Monday's initial
tryout period showed a great deal of
experienced material, announce
dance heads, but final decision will
be reached only after other candi
dates have exhibited their talents to
day.
Anyone with musical numbers
may submit them to Gordon Heche
at the same time.
Women should report in dancing
costumes or shorts, but may change
in the gym if they desire. The old
gym is' behind the new women's
gym, in the direction of the Press
Building.
All enterprising skit authors arc
required to report to Jim Copp, Al
pha Sig, if they have not already
done so, as this week is the last in
which sketches will be considered.
