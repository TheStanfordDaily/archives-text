# Cards, U.C. Dispute Daily Editorial On Aiding of Athletes
## Subsidizing Should Be Made Public Says Farm; Cal Thinks Not 
### John McClelland 
College athletics get financial
aid and deserve financial aid, and
the practice, which is .carried on
in practically every university,
should he entirely above hoard
and made public knowledge.
This opinion, voiced through the
editorial columns of the Daily earlier
this week, is shared unanimously by
a representaitve group of Stanford
coaches, students, and faculty mem
bers, a query sent out last night re
veals, but across the bay, from the
University of California, a typical
dissenting opinion has come.
Cal Disagrees
Cal Student President Aldcn Smith
and Cal Editor Walter Christie claim
the idea of making public the actual
facts about "subsidization" of ath
letes is too radical for California's
conservative student body. They
also claim that such a practice would
be "eloquent proof that college ath
letics and football in particular and
decidedly, uselessly, and needlessly
overemphasized."
The Cal men more than imply that
the more the paying and granting of
scholarships to athletes is kept quiet
and, in fact, not practiced, the better
off college athletics would be.
Such is not the opinion held by
those of the Farm.
William B. Owens, law professor
and faculty representative on Pa
cific Coast Intercollegiate Athletic
Conference, believes that athletes are
just as deserving of assistance from
the university as are other students
who are given scholarships, awards,
and special concessions for various
achievements.
No Discrimination
"There should be no discrimina
tion against the athlete," Owens
stated. "And as to the actual deal
ings with athletes, that is certainly
open and above board here at Stan
ford."
"Tiny" Thornhill, football coach,
believes every school has a right to
do as it pleases concerning athletes.
"If they want to pay their men, that's
all right; if they want to give them
scholarships, that's all right," Tiny
says. "But since they are perfectly
business-like transactions there is no
reason why they should be kept
under cover."
Dink Templeton, track coach,
says Stanford has always been out
in the open in dealing with her ath
letes and thinks that it is unfortu
nate that other schools are not in a
position to act in a similar way.
Thinks Daily Right
Hairy Maloney, veteran Stanford
coach and present director of minor
sports, declared: "I think the Daily
is absolutely right in its convictions.
Athletic scholarships and other ways
of aiding athletes should certainly
not be a thing to keep under cover.
All the schools in the Pacific Coast
conference should get together and
agree on policies of granting athletic
scholarships."
Bobby Grayson, varsity football
man, said that it was unfair to dis
criminate against the athlete be
cause he gets compensation for his
services.
Marvie Kahn, president of the
Associated Students, is not in favor
of giving direct cash aid to athletes,
but believes they deserve help in
the matter of tuition and living ex
penses. He thinks an open policy is
the best.
