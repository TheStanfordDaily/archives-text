# FARM TO FILL MEN'S COUNCIL VACANT POSTS
## Campus Settles Constitution Amendment Question At Today's Vote KAHN FAVORS PLAN Ballot Will Decide Fate Of Proposed Bonfire 
### 
To elect two pro-tem members of
Men's Council and to decide the faic
of the Rally Committee's proposed
Big Game Bonfire, and President
Marvie Kahn's proposed constitu
tional amendment giving the student
body president pro-tem appointment
power until special elections can be
called, Stanford students will go to
the polls today.
Polls will be at their usual place
on the law steps from 8:30 o'clock
in the morning until 2 o'clock in the
afternoon.
Ten Men Up
The members of Men's Council to
be chosen in the election will serve
until the regular A.S.S.U. election in
February, filling the places vacated
by Gene Brown and Dick Miles
when they graduated last June. John
Brock, election board chairman, an
nounces that a field of ten men has
been nominated for the position:
Andrew Bright, Bob Church, Tom
Collins, Charles Ducommon, OUie
Fenstermacher, Robert Gros, Fred
Heringer, Glenn Martineau, James
Mullen, and Waddy White.
President Marvie Kahn is sponsor
ing the appointment amendment in
order to avoid in the future the dif
ficulty that arose this quarter in re
spect to the vacancies in the Men's
Council. Though Ex Committee
considered the problem at the start
of the quarter, they were forced to
postpone the special election until a
sufficient time had elapsed for the
Daily to publicize the election and
for nominations to be made.
Marvin Kahn made the following
statement:
I favor- this amendment because
it will certainly increase the ef
ficiency of our student govern
mcnt. This proposal is not an at
tempt by the Executive Commit
tee to increase its present powers
but an honest desire to sec that
every organization will be able to
operate with full power at the very
start of each quarter. The vacan
cies on the Men's Council have
placed this year's council's work
on three men's shoulders.
"Plans for educating the Frosh
and new students about such im
portant institutions as the Honor
Code have been seriously delayed.
This amendment ,if passed, will give
the president of th A.S.S.U. and tin-
Executive Committee the power to
appoint officers pro tem. These ap
pointed men and women will serve
only until the Executive Committee
has time to call a special election. 1
sincerely hope that the students con
sider this question intelligently and
vote "Yes" for this amendment."
Caused Delay
This resulted in a month's delay in
electing the Men's Council members,
and prevented the full operation of
the council during that time. If this
proposition is passed, it will amend
Article 11, Section lb of the Con
stitution, and will give the president
"in consultation wilh the Ex Com
mittee" power to fill all student body
vacancies until a special election is
called.
Brock warns students that they
must follow carefully all instructions
on the ballot, being sure to vote in
ink.
Toy railroads are today one "1
the fastest growing hobbies among
men in the United States.
