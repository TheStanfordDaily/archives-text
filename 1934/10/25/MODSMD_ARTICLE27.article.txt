# Open Letter to Californians, Editor and A.S.U.C. President

(iKNTLKM KN
Yesterday, the Si am om> Daily naively ad
vanced the theory that, inasmuch as the prac
tice of "aiding" varsity athletes as carried on
by leading coast universities is common
knowledge and the subject of a good deal of
ridicule, it would be healthier and more salis
factory for all concerned to bring things out
into the open and legalize an equitable system
of caring for a situation that is obviously
fraught with danger today.
You, Mr. Christie, editor of the Daily Cali
fornian, answer that "this idea is a hit too
radical for California's conservative student
body." You, Mr. Smith, executive leader of
the Associated Students of California, retort
that the plan is "merely a proposal to buy
football athletes by the ton." My, my! And
here we are, in college.
The Stantoiu) Daily is not arguing the
merits of the basic proposition as to whether
it is feasible to help athletes financially during
their registration at a given university. Cer
tainly, the collegiate world is infested with
sut'li practice today, a practice that is hidden
and spoken of in hushed tones by authorities
eve ry where.
It is not a question of paying athletes, but
rather a question of admitting a positive fact
and thereby making those athletes feel clean
and above-hoard for the doing.
California may, as you say, be "too con
servative" to admit a situation that is preg
nant with disaster. II is peculiar, however,
thai the Daily Californian lasl week com
mented editorially:
"Surely, California has ?,') of the 2(> South
ern California pre/) stars here (al Berkeley)
I his year, aefimj upon Ihe old 'When in
Home, etc.' theory. ... If any other coast
college is yuilty of proselytiny (let's not
<jo into that), I'.S.C. has only itself to
thank. . . ."
In other words, scarcely a week back, the
Daily Calif ornian nicely admitted a sel of
circumstances that the same newspaper now
considers "too radical" for frank, open con
sideration.
If the Daily Calif ornian wants to make the
issue another simikfr to that of lasl week's in
which Southern California and California en
gaged in a public mud-slinging contest re
sulting from a series of indiscreet accusations,
Ihe S i am oiu) Daily will not shy oil'.
Stanford has nothing to hide. Any athlete
who has received a scholarship, on his scho
lastic ability and need for aid, is registered in
the President's office.
* ♦ *
Mill as long as every university engages in
subsidizing athletes to some extent, why not
do il openly? As long as the athletes gel Ibis
income, why not let them gel it fairly and
squarely so that there will he no need for
lliem to feel ashamed?
We are not asking for another scandalous
investigation such as the Butler fiasco of a
year ago. litil a situation demands to be rec
ognized, and if is high lime we acl.

Yesterday, the Si am om> Daily naively ad
vanced the theory that, inasmuch as the prac
tice of "aiding" varsity athletes as carried on
by leading coast universities is common
knowledge and the subject of a good deal of
ridicule, it would be healthier and more salis
factory for all concerned to bring things out
into the open and legalize an equitable system
of caring for a situation that is obviously
fraught with danger today.
You, Mr. Christie, editor of the Daily Cali
fornian, answer that "this idea is a hit too
radical for California's conservative student
body." You, Mr. Smith, executive leader of
the Associated Students of California, retort
that the plan is "merely a proposal to buy
football athletes by the ton." My, my! And
here we are, in college.
The Stantoiu) Daily is not arguing the
merits of the basic proposition as to whether
it is feasible to help athletes financially during
their registration at a given university. Cer
tainly, the collegiate world is infested with
sut'li practice today, a practice that is hidden
and spoken of in hushed tones by authorities
eve ry where.
It is not a question of paying athletes, but
rather a question of admitting a positive fact
and thereby making those athletes feel clean
and above-hoard for the doing.

servative" to admit a situation that is preg
