						Privilege to Hear Them

Having successfully weathered several difti
ciilt and almost disastrous years, the Stanford
(loncert Series comes through this season with
one of the finest and hest-halaneed programs
that it has yet presented. The best things in

life, however, an* not always free and it is
only by student financial support that the
Series can continue.
It is not often that a community the size
of Stanford is visited by such world-famous
artists as the Don Cossack chorus, Igor Stra
vinsky, Huth Slenczynski, and Keodor C.ha
liapin. Mat this year, in addition to distin
guished outsiders, the Series management
will present a combined concert by three of
Stanford's own organizations the Stanford
band, the glee club, and the symphony or
chestra. Already well-known for its work at
the football games, the Stanford band also
possesses a concert repertoire that has proved
very popular on past occasions.
Less familiar to campus audiences but
equally distinguished in their fields are the
glee club and the symphony orchestra. The
glee club's appearances oil' the campus have
given it a favorable reputation that few Stan
fordiles properly appreciate. During winter
quarter a Stanford audience will be given its
first opportunity to hear these three musical
organizations on the same program. Prepa
rations have already begun and Stanford's
own music, at its best, will soon make its local
debut as a full-lledged member of the Con
cert Series.
The Series has come through the worst
years of the depression. Though faced with
extinction more than once, it has survived.
With the most trying years now past, it would
be folly for Stanford to relax in its efforts to
keep the Series going. The only way to assure
its continuance is by tangible, financial sup
port.
If Stanford students like line music, the
Concert Series office would be interested in
hearing about it. Tickets are now on sale.
