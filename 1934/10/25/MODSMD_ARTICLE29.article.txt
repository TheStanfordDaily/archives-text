Skeptics who doubt the ability of Stanford
students to manage their own affairs are in
vited to take a look at the October statements
of the Farm's 24 fraternities. These show
that only three houses are now in the red and
that these three have every possibility of being
back on the black side of the ledger within the
next year or two. Redecorating and rebuild
ing are responsible for at least two of these
deficits.
It was only about two years ago that most
of the fraternities were in :i sad financial
muddle. Red ink predominated in the house
records and the prospect for the future seemed
none too hopeful. Economies majors could
tell the President how to gel the country out
of the depression, but they couldn't cope with
the house meat bill.
Justified criticism by the Administration
along about this time was accepted ;is a chal
lenge. To prove that Stanford students can
at least put their own houses in order, a new
system was put into ellect. Monthly auditings
and the supervision of the Interfraternity
Council finance committee, along with the ac
tive co-operation of each house, soon began to
shave down the deficits.
The success of the fraternities is tangible
evidence that Stanford students are not irre
sponsible adolescents. Student government
and student business are slill safe in the
hands of the students themselves.
