# Enthusiasm Prevails At Game Rally
## Cutler, Speegle, Thornhill Speak at Pavilion 
### Craig Barbash 
Leland Cutler, congenial grad and
president of Stanford's Board of
Trustees spoke. . . . Paul Speegle
showed how yells were led in '29
. . . the glee club and band voiced
their all . . . men of '38 graced the
floor . . . and the center of attention,
the Stanford varsity football squad,
listened as their coach told them
and the throng who gathered to lis
ten what Stanford might expect Sat
urday in the football game against
Southern California.
All this, in between the yells
struck off by Yell Leader Triolo and
his men, focused the attention of (he
University last night at the pre
game rally in the pavilion, and gave
vent to a mighty spirit rumbling in
the Stanford Indian's breast at the
approach of arch foe number one—
Southern California.
Exchanged Positions
'This year we are in the same po
sition U.S.C. was last year—minus
the Espee railway," was Thorn
hill's key remark, recalling the de
lay Stanford's team incurred en
route last year. Then Stanford func
tioned in the most spirited manner
with psychology stacked against
them, as "everyone knows it is this
year, with S.C. fighting to upset us
for a successful season" was Thorn
hill's ray of hope for the assembled
rooters. ' But we won't score any
hundred points Saturday," he added.

As if to prove that gracing the pa
vilion's floor during a spirited S.C.
game rally had not dampened their
fae, the knights of '38 stampeded
from the pavilion after the final yell
and, marching hundreds strong from
Encina, waved flaming torches at
their "flames" to engage Roble's in
mates in a bit of friendly civil war.
After dispute caused by missiles
flying both from and to Roble's bal
conies, the "Stanford, rah, rah, rah"
theme changed to "good night ladies,
for we must part," and torches, men
and pajamas tore away from the
near-irresistibility of Roble's attrac
tions to go charging down the road,
and so to the show in Paly.
