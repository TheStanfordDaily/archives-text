Mayor of Palo Alto, president of the League ot
California Municipalities, and professor of civil en
gineering, are three positions simultaneously held by
Earl Charles Thomas, which make him one of the
busiest men on the Stanford faculty.
As president of the League of California Munici
palities during the past year. Professor Thomas has
becomc an expert in the field of civic politics in
California. Both the September and October, 1934,
issues of the monthly periodical "Western City
carry a good-sized picture of Professor Thomas in
recognition of his outstanding civic work in connec
tion with the League of California Municipalities.
Ramifications and power of the League of California
Municipalities is not generally known. Professor
Thomas points out that this organization is 36 years old,
and that 203 of the 280 municipalities of the State of
California are members.
Purposes of the League are to render informational
service, promote legislation favorable to cities and
oppose laws inimical to civic interests, carry on active
legislative campaigns during the session of the state
legislature; conduct governmental research, work for
closer co-ordination between municipal and state and
federal governments, particularly on public works,
civic loans, and SERA relations.
Expert legal counsel is retained by the league for
cities, whose function it is not to supplement, but to
assist, city attorneys. Offices are maintained in Los
Angeles and San Francisco, and a field representative is
employed who travels his entire time from city to
city in the interests of the league.
Professor Thomas revealed that the league intends
to carry a fight before the California legislature during
the next session to secure an additional allotment of
the gas tax for city streets. Eighty per cent of Cali
fornia's population is concentrated in municipalities,
but nearly all the gas tax goes to the public highways
and county roads. Past league efforts diverted one
fourth cent per gallon of the gas tax to city coffers for
street purposes through laws enacted due to an effec
tive campaign carried on in th legislature. The league
hopes to increase this allotment to one-half cent.
"Economic depression has produced a gradual
weakening of local government," observes Profes
sor Thomas. "Functions of local units of govern
ment are gradually being absorbed by slate and
federal governments. Sources of local revenue are
constantly being appropriated more and more b.v
state and national administrations. I feel this is a
deleterious tendency, inasmuch as the local unit
of government is always closcst to the people, and,
all in all, renders the most direct service to them.
"I should like to see the manager plan for
countries adopted more extensively," states Pro
fessor Thomas. "I feel that this is one way of
strengthening local government. The executive
plan of government for counties places the county
on an efficient, business-like basis."
Professor Thomas concluded by stating that in view
if the federal unemployment SERA program, and state
indigent relief, the city of Palo Alto has to expend
practically no money for relief purposes.
