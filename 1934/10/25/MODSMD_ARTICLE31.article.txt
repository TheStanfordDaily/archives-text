"BRITISH AGENT"
Al Stanford Theatre
A vivid photoplay based upoft
R. H. Bruce Lockhart's autobiogra
phy, "British Agent," is an intelli
gent and often stirring picture of
Bolshevist Russia and diplomatic in
i trigue in 1917. The story concerns !
| Stephen Locke (Leslie Howard),
i who is sent as the British unofficial i
j emissary to prevent the new, un
[ recognized Russian government |
| from negotiating a separate peace j
treaty with Germany. He falls in
leve with Elena (Kay Francis), ihe
, beautiful secretary to Pavlov (Irv- j
j ing Pichel), head of the Russian se
, cret police.
The romance between Locke and
Elena leads up to an exciting climax
when Elena, because she cannot !
turn her lover over to a firing squad,
arranges for the explosion of the
building in which he is hiding, and 1
then joins him without informing
| him of their impending fate.
The performance is uniformly ex- i
j cellent, Howard's being an especially
) outstanding portrayal, suggesting
! Locke's desperate courage and the J
I nervous tension under which he;
worked. Kay Francis, more animated i
| than usual, is a convincing spy. The'
I direction is swift in pace and in
i genious in development. The dia- j
I logue is both witty and subtle, and
! the photography is clever in its
treatment of mobs.
The second picture, an uninspired
j backstage story, "Wake Up and
' Dream," features the late Russ Co
| lumbo.
