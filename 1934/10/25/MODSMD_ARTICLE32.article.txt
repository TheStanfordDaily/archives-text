# "THEASURE ISLAND" At Blanco's Theatre
## 
### 
One of the "clean" pictures that
the Legion of Decency has been call- j
! ing for, this faithful interpretation oi
Stevenson's "blood - and - thunder" j
: adventure story manages to be pure
j without being puerile, an accom
i plishment these days. In fact, the
fine performances of Wallace Beery i
(who makes "Long John Silver" a
lovable rather than a terrifying vil- j
I lain) and Jackie Cooper (who has!
grown in acting ability as well as
' stature during the past year) makes ,
this picture as entertaining for you
j as for your little brother.
