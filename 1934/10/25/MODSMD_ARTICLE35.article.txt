INJURIES ARE
REALLY BLESSINGS
Stanford has been bothered wit!
.several injuries already this year
which caused heartfelt groans a
first.
But in reality all of Stanford';
bruises and cracked bones, now thu
they are healed, have proven them
selves a real help in shaping a grouj
ol potential conference champions.
Stanford, with eleven men con
ceded as good as any on the Coast
when the season started, was hard
up for reserves. Each position
went little better than one deep,
and two players at best were all
that could be relied on.
Now, however, there are reserve!
for nearly every post on the squad
They had to show themselves as the
regulars cracked up, and they pro
ceeded to do so, even going so lai
t as to challenge the first-string men
in many cases, for number one'cal
at the position in question.
BRANDIN, LARSEN
PROVE THEMSELVES
Wes Muller, center, was the firs
to be hurt. He pulled a shouldei
muscle in the first week of practicc
and this kept him on the sidelines
for two full weeks.
All" Brandin, although fairly
light, came through and sparkled
in the San Jose State and Santa
Clara games. For a long time it
was held possible that Brandin
would keep the first-string berth
all during the year.
Then, with Muller getting bad*
into shape, Brandin was laid up will'
a sinus infection. That made it nec
essary to go into the third team foi
a center to start the Oregon State
contest. One was found in Niels
Larsen, Menlo J.C. transfer. Lar
sen came thi'ough, and he and Bran
din are together in pressing Mullei
for the starting berth now that al
three are back in form.
BACKFIELD CRAWLING
WITH SUBSTITUTES
Bobby Grayson was the first oi
the backfield men to be injured. He
did not play against Northwestern
and Bones Hamilton took his place
in, the ball-carrying role. Hamil
ton's showing is history.
This made it possible for Gord>
Head to show himself at Hamilton's
vacated halfback post. With But
Maentz and Buck Van Dellen already
having proved themselves equal al
left half, and Stan Anderson show
ing up as nearly a match for Fratikit
Alustiza at quarterback, the back
field was two-deep throughout.
RESERVE ENDS
GIVEN CHANCE
Keith Topping's temporary injury
>at end gave Carlos Monsalve anc
Jack Clark an opportunity to alter
nate with first-string end duties
and they showed undisputedly tha
they are fit and ready to relieve
Topping during the remainder of the
season. .
Then at running guard, thought
at first to be fortified by only
Woody Adams, appeared Bol>
Black. Inconspicuous until Ad
ams' jaw was cracked and he had
to play against San Francisco
University, Black stood up well
for nearly all ol' the Don game.
On the whole, these positions tha
"were hit by injuries were considered
prior to those misfortunes, to be ih<
weak ones on the team. With th<
tackles already claiming reserv

power in Ed Lettunich and Jack
Drown, and right guard having Jack
j Walton to relieve Larry Rouble,
j Stanford will suffer little unless she
is forced to go eleeper than the sec
i ond string.
