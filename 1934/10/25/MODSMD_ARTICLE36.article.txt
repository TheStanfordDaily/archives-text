# FROSH GRIDSTERS GO EASY AS TROY ENCOUNTER NEARS
## Important Clash a Toss-Up; Frosh in Good Shape, Rely on Passes 
### 
Frosh footballers took it easy yes-
I terday, biding their time until the
! invasion of the strong Trobabes
j Saturday noon.
I Coach Jim Bradshaw is saving all
j the energy possible for his men. All
! week he has merely run the first
j two teams through their plays, pol
| Lshing up old tricks and augmenting
i with a few new ones. He is taking no
! chance with injuries. No odds are
| being given at present.
His team is now intact save for
! the absence of Bob Dalcan from the
I line-up. This smooth end had
j started every game, but in Satur-
J day's contest with San Mateo was
! hit hard and the result wi.l probably
I keep him from playing Saturday.
Trobabes Fair
Jeff Cravath's Trobabes have had a
! fair season, winning and losing two
! games. They took Chaffee J.C., 19-0,
I and Santa Ana J.C., 7-0. Then a
i strong Compton J.C. team fell upon
! them and won, 9-0.
| Clint Evans' pack of big Calcubs
j journeyed south last Saturday anel
i took the Trobabes by a 14-6 count.
This last was no disastrous defeat
| for the southerners, though, as the
Cal boys have made veritable fielel
j meets of most of their games this
year.
Bradshaw relies upon a hard
i blocking line, supplanted by several
| luminaries in the backfield. He has
! worked up one of the surest passing
• attacks seen in these parts for some
1 time. Collins, Paulman, or Hamilton
to Layer, Stone, Coffis, Collins —it is
j all the same. Most of them connect.
Collins a la Bobby
Last night halfback Collins was
faking a pass, sweeping wide behind
the line, and suddenly cutting back
down the field, as perfect an imita
tion of Grayson on the same play as
I could be heiped for.
On an occasional lateral after a
i forward, Jimmy Coffis gets the ball
in the open, and once this diminu
j tive dynamo is clear of the line of
scrimmage it's three-to-one that the
Four Horsemen couldn't stop him.
Bradshaw also has worked up some
tricky underhand passes to an end
who hits the middle of the line,
followed by a lateral. All very stra
! tegic.
Last night was running a Team
1 A of Collins, Coffis, Paulman, and
| Gillette, backs; Stone and Layer,
ends; Henningson and Oberg, tackles;
j McKinney and Holrid|te, guards,
and Heath, center.
Four Good Ends
On Team B there were Hamilton,
Madlem, Roberts, and Luckett,
backs; Peters, Hardin, Wyett, and
Dillon, ends; Bell and Krupp, tackles;

Partridge and Drace, guards, and
Sullivan, center.
Stars of the S.C. yearlings appear
! to be Nirk Pappas, quarterback, and
Art Stranske, fullback, of Scaita
Ana. Other backs who have given
Coach Cravath an extra heart-beat
are Sloan, Thompson, and Pickens.
| The ends, Gaisford and Williams,
! have shown stellar quality of late.

tion of Grayson on the same play as
I could be heiped for.
On an occasional lateral after a
i forward, Jimmy Coffis gets the ball
in the open, and once this diminu
j tive dynamo is clear of the line of
scrimmage it's three-to-one that the
Four Horsemen couldn't stop him.
Bradshaw also has worked up some
tricky underhand passes to an end
who hits the middle of the line,
followed by a lateral. All very stra
! tegic.
Last night was running a Team
1 A of Collins, Coffis, Paulman, and
| Gillette, backs; Stone and Layer,
ends; Henningson and Oberg, tackles;
j McKinney and Holrid|te, guards,
and Heath, center.
Four Good Ends
On Team B there were Hamilton,
Madlem, Roberts, and Luckett,
backs; Peters, Hardin, Wyett, and
Dillon, ends; Bell and Krupp, tackles;

Partridge and Drace, guards, and
Sullivan, center.
Stars of the S.C. yearlings appear
! to be Nirk Pappas, quarterback, and
Art Stranske, fullback, of Scaita
Ana. Other backs who have given
Coach Cravath an extra heart-beat
are Sloan, Thompson, and Pickens.
| The ends, Gaisford and Williams,
! have shown stellar quality of late.
Frosh footballers took it easy yes-
I terday, biding their time until the
! invasion of the strong Trobabes
j Saturday noon.
I Coach Jim Bradshaw is saving all
j the energy possible for his men. All
! week he has merely run the first
j two teams through their plays, pol
| Lshing up old tricks and augmenting
i with a few new ones. He is taking no
! chance with injuries. No odds are
| being given at present.
His team is now intact save for
! the absence of Bob Dalcan from the
I line-up. This smooth end had
j started every game, but in Satur-
J day's contest with San Mateo was
! hit hard and the result wi.l probably
I keep him from playing Saturday.
Trobabes Fair
Jeff Cravath's Trobabes have had a
! fair season, winning and losing two
! games. They took Chaffee J.C., 19-0,
I and Santa Ana J.C., 7-0. Then a
i strong Compton J.C. team fell upon
! them and won, 9-0.
| Clint Evans' pack of big Calcubs
j journeyed south last Saturday anel
i took the Trobabes by a 14-6 count.
This last was no disastrous defeat
| for the southerners, though, as the
Cal boys have made veritable fielel
j meets of most of their games this
year.
Bradshaw relies upon a hard
i blocking line, supplanted by several
| luminaries in the backfield. He has
! worked up one of the surest passing
• attacks seen in these parts for some
1 time. Collins, Paulman, or Hamilton
to Layer, Stone, Coffis, Collins —it is
j all the same. Most of them connect.
Collins a la Bobby
Last night halfback Collins was
faking a pass, sweeping wide behind
the line, and suddenly cutting back
down the field, as perfect an imita
tion of Grayson on the same play as
I could be heiped for.
