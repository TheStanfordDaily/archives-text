# Attendance Slim at New Ad Building Reading Room
## 
### 
Students have not yet been taking
advantage of ihe facilities offered by
the new Ad Building reading room,
Alexander von Vaaften, librarian in
charge, stated yesterday. Only 15 to
20 students have appeared each night
since the reading room opened last
Monday, although the seating ca
pacity is 110.
Over 200 books that are required
reading in lower division courses are
available from 7 to 10 o'clock each
week night, and the students' lack
of interest is probably due to the
newness of the room. When the stu
dent body becomes more familiar,
with this innovation, and the reading
and lighting facilities are complete,
a larger attendance is expected.
