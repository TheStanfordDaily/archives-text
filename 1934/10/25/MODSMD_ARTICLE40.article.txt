## Stanford Tangles with San Jose State in Second Battle Saturday 
### Lanidrac 
"The best showing they have made
yet this season." That is the way
Coach Harry Maloney felt about his
soccer squad after an hour and a
half of hard scrimmage yesterday
afternoon.
For the first time the squad as a
whole seemed to be functioning as a
soccer team .should, Maloney said.
The forwards and half backs were
handling the ball more as if they
knew exactly what they were doing
with it.
Maloney is working his squad hard
this week in preparation for the San
Jose State game Saturday morning.
Stanford played the State team once
this season in a practice tilt and
won 2-0. San Jo.se has lost all her
conference games this season.
Off to a rather bad start with in
sufficient practice before the season
started, the Indians lost their first
two conference games and are now
at the bottom of the standings with
San Jose. Maloney now is pointing
toward developing the team to a
peak for the series with California,
which is always the climax of the
soccer season.
