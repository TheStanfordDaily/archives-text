The first honest-to-gosh thriller
made its appearance on the scene in
intramural football at the frosh fields
yesterday.
S.A.E. and Theta Chi battled tooth
and nail for almost two full halves.
If anything the hard-lighting S.A.E.'s
had the edge. But with two minutes
to play things broke. Jim Trompas'
pass from the 25-yard line was in
terfered with. Theta Chi was given
the ball on the 1-yard line, first
down, and the next play Trompas
went around end for a touchdown.
Conversion I<\iils
The conversion failed and the
game ended at 6 to 0.
El Campo, incidentally, nosed out
Theta XI 6 to 0 by virtue of Sam
Lee's brilliant play, which climaxed
in the game's only score.
At the same time on an adjacent
field Encina 4W was falling a 31 to 0
victim to Sigma Nu I, last year's

champions. Bud Shreve and his
' mates, particularly Louis Bansbach
and Jim Mullin, proved too expe
i rienced for the Encina team.
Shreve Stars
Shreve figured in every score, j
passing to Butler for the first, run
j ning over for the second, passing to j
i Bansbach for the third, to Mullin
| for the fourth, and polishing off a
i concerted drive by running for
i touchdown number five.
Lists for match play in other intra- !
! mural sports, golf, and handball, \
| were posted yesterday. The upper
[ man of each bracket is responsible
for arranging the match, which must
, be played this week, according to
Giff Myers, assistant intramural
J manager.
