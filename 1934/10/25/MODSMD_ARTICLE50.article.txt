# INDEPENDENT STUDY PLAN FIRST STARTED IN EUROPE
## 
### 
Begun in 1925, the Independent
Study Plan at Stanford established
as its purpose "to provide special op
portunity to students of exceptional
ability," with the further provision
that these students should be of the
upper division.
The plan was not new. On the
contrary, under the name of the tu
torial system, it has been in effect
for centuries on the Continent, and
is now the accepted rule in institu
tions of higher learning in England.
Nor was Stanford the first to use
this system in America. When the
late President Wilson was head of
Princeton University he intx-oduced
it. there, calling it the preceptorial
system. To carry out his plan, he
gathered together 50 or 60 young
men who should act as tutors, or
preceptors, for students who wished
to pursue their studies independent
of the classroom, but who still
needed some higher guidance.
Hardin Craig, now professor of
English here, who was formerly a
student at Oxford and got his Ph.D.
at Princeton, was one of those young
tutors with whom Wilson experi
mented on his system. For ten years
Professor Craig served in this ca
pacity. This quarter he is chairman
of the Independent Study Plan in
the absence of Professor Edgar Eu
gene Robinson, who ordinarily heads
it.
Speaking of the plan, Professor
Craig said, "It is not like a perma
it is self-propelled, something the

student does for himself." He em
phasized the fact that only those
students who want and deserve re
sponsibility above the average, and
who are willing to gain knowledge |
for themselves and not be depend
j ent on the lecture and the classroom
should attempt to go into this type
of work.
In the fall of 1931 the General
Education Board, a part of the
Rockefeller Foundation, interested
in the work which was being done
[ at Stanford, granted $100,000 to the
I University, and independent study
was made available to lower division
| students. This grant was necessary
1 to the furthering of the work be
cause such a system requires the
j addition of tutors to the staff of the
University, and also means more
I work on the part of those already on
i the faculty.
This year an additional grant of
! $15,000 for a two-year period was
| made by the board to the Independ
i ent Study Plan here, and will allow
; for further expansion of the system.
I Until now there has been no official
I provision made for the junior stu-
J dent who has completed lower divi
| sion work and is capable of contin
, uing in independent study. Although
| there have been some upper division
: students who took this work, this
! year there will be greater opportu
nity for such students.
A school with a $5 tuition has been
j organized in Fairfield, Conn.
