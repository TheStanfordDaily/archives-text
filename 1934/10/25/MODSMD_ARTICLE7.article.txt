With the EPIC plan snowed under
by a 6 to 1 vote and Governor Mer
riam winning by a substantial mar
gin, Stanford students displayed
their intense interest in politics yes
terday when a straw vote of the
campus was taken by the Stanford
Daily.
In a separate faculty poll, on
state and national politics, Merriam
won, but not by such a large ma
jority, and the EPIC plan lost, as
in the student poll.
Ballot Sets Record
Approximately 803 students voted
and of the 250 members of the aoa
demic faculty reached, 202 turned in
ballots. This is the largest straw
vote of the campus ever taken.
Results of the student poll are:
For governor: Merriam, 456;
Sinclair, 173; and Haight, 150.
Three write-ins for Dempster, and
two for Darcy.
"Do you believe the EPIC plan «
would be a success if put into
action?" Yes, 111; no, 656.
"Would you vote for Roosevelt
if he were up for re-election now?"
Yes, 462; no, 320.
"Do you believe that the New
Deal and NRA have been aids to
recovery?" Yes, 407: no, 337.
The total on each measure does not
tally with the total number of stu
dents who voted because not all
measures were voted on by each
person.
Results of the faculty poll are:
For governor: Merriam, 83;
Sinclair, 54; and Haight, 27.
Success of EPIC plan, etc.: yes,
35; no. 134.
Roosevelt re-election now, etc.:
yes, 101; no. 55.
New Deal and NRA aid to re
covery, etc.: yes, 86; no, 57.
It is interesting to note that more
faculty than students, in proportion
io the number of each that voted,
were for Sinclair and the EPIC plan.
All branches of the faculty were
represented in the poll, though in
some cases only one or two mem
bers in a department voted. Physics,
chemistry and economics depart
ments had the most complete cov
erage.
