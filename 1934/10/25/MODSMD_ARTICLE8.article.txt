# Bonfire Poll Taken Today
## 
### 
Will Stanford be content with a
bonfire that is built in one day at a
cost of less than $100?
That is what the campus is won
dering about with the proposal be
ing put to student vote at the
A.S.S.U. election today.
The faculty objections that caused
the plan to be overruled and aban
doned after the Big Game Bonfire
of 1932 have been eliminated by the
planning committee which has made
a survey of possibilities. Time and
cost were the chief factors which
made the faculty and press put pres
sure on the Ex Committee, who
voted the abandonment of the fire.
The fuel for this proposed fire will
be furnished through the courtesy
of Mark NesbiU of Palo Alto, who
has donated the timber on 20 -crcs
which he owns at La Honda. Main
stays for the fire will be furnished
by the telephone company, which
has volunteered old poles, and by
the Southern Pacific Railroad, which
has volunteered old railroad tics.
These donations place the cost of
the fire easily within the appropria
tion of $100 as only the petroleum
and the transportation of the wood
from La Honda would be on the
A.S.S.U. budget.
Though the donations of materials
are satisfactory to the campus, cur
rent views vary on whether a worth
while bonfire could be built within
the time limit of one day. As in the
past years the freshman class will be
cxpected to do the greater part of
the work for the project. It is
thought that others will assist owing
to the short length of time given.
