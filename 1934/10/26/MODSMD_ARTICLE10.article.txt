# RALLYMEN PLAN 'FANCY' STUNTS
## 
### 
Among the "fanciest card stunts j
in the history of Stanford rooting |
sections," was the way in which !
Rally Committee heads expressed i
themselves when approached on the i
subject of tomorrow's rooting sec
tion.
Two thousand rooters, women and
men, will assemble tomorrow in the
Stanford Stadium in a colorful array
that will attempt to surpass anything 1
heretofore seen in the local oval, j
Men will not be admitted to the root- \
ing section without rooters' hats or I
white shirts. Women will be re- I
quired to wear white dresses or ;
blouses and carry pom poms. Root- i
ers' hats may be obtained at Wide- 1
man's in Palo Alto and pom poms j
will be on sale this afternoon at the j
A.S.S.U. office for twenty cents. j
Megaphones will be distributed to
the Stanford rooters through the
courtesy of Desmonds, men's cloth- i
ing store in Los Angeles. During j
half time six fancy card stunts will j
be featured by the Cardinal cheering j
section and a graphic description of ,
the stunts will be broadcast over the i
radio in a wide hookup.
Along with the card display there |
will be a special Navy Day stunt j
included in the section.
