# VARSITY HOOPMEN LOOK FOR BRIGHT CONFERENCE YEAR
## 
### 
Under the direction of Chuck
I Glasglow, the 1935 Cardinal quin
| tet has spent the past four weeks
perparing for a strenuous series of
I practice tilts during November and
December, preceding the usual
| coast conference competition of Jan
uary and February.
Though saving promises until af
ter the Cal or U.S.C. games, the var
sity has several reasons why it is
i justified in expecting a better pear
in '35 than they had in '34, when
they ended third in the conference,
beating the Bears once and U.S.C.
; twice.
Only Two Graduate
First, the Cards lost by gradu
ation only Captain Harold Edelen
and Chuck Rogers. Emil Cowing,
I Arne Anderson, Keith Topping,
Robin Lindsey, Ken Nobbs, Gordon
Mallatratt, and A1 Paige will be
back again.
Secondly, up from a frosh team
. which lost two out of over thirty
j games, are a half-dozen men of
varsity calibre. Bryan Moore, guard;
j and Howell Turner, forward, will be
, hard to keep off the first five; while
Allen Duncan, Dale Huff, and Bill
Quade, forwards, La Rue Smith,
center, and Art Zamloch and Carl
Schott, guard, will be valuable re
serve materials.
Transfers Eligible
The third reason for the Card
optimism is the list of players eligible :
| next season for the first time, in- |
eluding a group of junior college'
transfers. Don Greenlee, Ken Bell, 1
j and Jack Ivey are ineligibles of last j
season now clear of regulations.
Andy Spears from Long Beacli J.C.
and Ralph Mannion of the '32 frosh
are also candidates for the squad.
Finally, the varsity will be bol
stered by a number of juniors and
I seniors thoroughly trained in the
Card system of play but lacking
in experience. These include Rod
Bost, George Virguie, Marvie Kahn,
j and Mill Luhman.
