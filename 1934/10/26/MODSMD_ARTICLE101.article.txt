## 
### 
BERKELEY, Oct. 25 (/P).â€”Realiz
ing that the California Bears may
find any kind of weather in Seattle
Saturday, Coach Ingram has devel
oped a wet backfield and a dry back
field.
The mud boys who will stick
strictly to power plays, are quarter
back Monty Reedy, halfbacks Frank
Walker and "Chili"' Bertoli, and full
back A1 Thorell.
If the field is dry, the Bears will
probably use a wide oper. offense
and plenty of passes. "Wild Bill"
Archer, southpaw passer, will be in
Reedy's position, and Jim Carlyon
or Arleigh Williams will replace
Bertoli.
