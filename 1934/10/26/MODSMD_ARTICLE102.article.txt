# S.C. Upsets Recalled As Cardinals Favored
## 
### MORT D'EVELYN 
Aside from the overflowing sta-'
diums the pandemonium, the card
stunts, the bands, and other razzle
dazzle common to all major football
games, the Card-Trojan classic to
morrow will have two main tradi
tions behind it: that Southern Cali
fornia has never been beaten in the
Stanford Stadium since Howard
Jones took over the coaching reins
at S.C., andâ€”upsets.
Upsets, of course, have helped
Jones and his Thundering Herd to
live up to the first tradition. With
the exception of the famous 13-6
come-through of the vowing sophs
of Stanford last year, the upsets in
recent years have always turned out
in S.C.'s favor. I
In 1927 Stanford was favored 5-4
and just barely squeaked through
with a 13-13 tie, by virtue of a last
minute pass. With the same unsur
passed guard combination of Post
and Robesky, the Cards were fa
vorites the next year, but fumbled
through a 13-0 defeat.
The next year the Trojans won a
predicted toss-up with a pass touch
down and conversion. Again in 1932
the dopesters favored the Cards with
10-7 odds, and U.S.C. won, 13-0.
But of all the disappointing games
to Card fans, the 1930 debacle re
mains supreme. So sure was the
Farm of at last beating the Trojans
that the Stanford Daily had this to
say of the game: "Like children on

the day before Christmas, the Stan
tord student body . . . waits eagerly
for the ,surprises which Warner has
prepared for Jones. A contagious
spirit of confidence pervades the
team."
