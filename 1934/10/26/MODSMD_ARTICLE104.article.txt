# CROWD WILL COME FOR MANY REASONS
## 
### 
There are muny and varied rea>-
sons why John Public will put out
$2.75 in cash or check to watch an
underdog Troy eleven attempt to tip
over an undefeated and favored
group of Cardinals.
In the first place there is the tra
dition angle. That always helps to
huihl gate receipts. Stanford and
IJ.S.C. have a reputation of put
ting forth football demonstrations
second only to the Card-Bear
game.
The friendly, and sometimes not so
friendly, hatred the pair of Coast
Conference teams show for each
other, coupled with the ever-present
enthusiasm shown by the rooting
sections, the invariable partisanship
shown one way or the other by
every fan present, and the records
of former S.C.-Stanford games all
are part of the tradition, and they
ffll will bring in some customers.
SOME HOPE TO SEE
TROY SMOTHERED
Then there are others, almost en
tirely Northern California residents,
who want to see the Trojans beaten
on northern soil. They would heart
ily enjoy the situation if Stanford
should happen to win by a 50-0 score.
Of course, there are a group of
particularly members of
the Hollywood film colony, who
would have*a more enjoyable af
ternoon if U.S.C. should win by
that hind of score.
Then there are the Cardinal fans,
thinking in terms of Rose Bowl, who
believe the Trojan contest will do a

' lot toward deciding things one way
or the other. They are anxious to
get first-hand knowledge concerning
the Indian chances.
WHAT IS TROY'S
CHANCE TO WIN?
Stanford will be favored, despite
what the respective publicity de
partments can do to even the odds.
But both teams have something up
their sleeves, and Troy definitely has
plans of tripping the Cards. This is
as good a place as any to discuss
U.S.C.'s chances of staging this up
set.
In the first place, Howard Jones
still has Cotton Warburton as a
spark to his attack. Warburton
has done little or nothing in the
way of making long gains this
year, but he is still the same all-
American, and is dangerous every
play while he is on the field.
Warburton's biggest chance of get
ting away for a long gain or even a
touchdown against Stanford seems to
be on a punt runback. The Cotton
top is performing behind a line that
so far has shown very few poten-
I tialities. Hence he has been, and
probably will be bottled up tornor
i row on running plays.
But the Indian 'punters have been
in the habit of picking so far that
the ends cannot cover the punts in
time. All Warburton needs is a
"hance to get into the clear, and it
he has 10 yards start on a kick re
turn he may get away. Swisher of
Northwestern, not even in the same
class with Warburton, accomplished
several long runbacks against a tired
Cardinal team two weeks ago.
Southern California's next best
chance of scoring will be through
the air. Troy is noted for being a
smooth bunch of passers, and they
showed a limited spurt of aerial
strength at Pittsburgh when they
put over one touchdown on the
Panthers.
There is a possibility that an only
fair Trojan line will be fired enough
to outdrive the Cards and score on
a running attack. But the Jones men
will have to show considerably more
than they have at any other time
this year in order to accomplish this.
On the whole, unless Stanford is
decidedly and unexpectedly off
1 form, U.S.C. can only hope for one,
or at most, two touchdowns tomor
row, and the chief Troy chance of
victory will lie in an inspired de
; fense. â€”Millard Browne.
