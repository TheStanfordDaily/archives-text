# EAST GRID CHAMPS STILL UNCERTAIN; IOWA STATE, MINNESOTA STAND HIGH
## 
### 
King football, the sport, lacks a
king within its realm as big games
Saturday begin the drive down the
stretch for elevens throughout the
United States.
In the East where later starts are
made the situation is too compli
cated to pick anything but tentative
standouts. On the Pacific Coast, in
the Mid-West, and in the South the
Returns of crucial games Saturday
must come in before guesses as to
national and sectional champions
can be offered.
Team Spirit Counts
This much is certain, a general
Reveling of ability throughout the
United States makes the job of a
championship team a process of
plodding through opponents of prac
tically equal ability every Saturday.
The spirit of the team on each Sat
urday, it is more apparent, is the
deciding factor in most cases, inas
much as ability is so much on a
pfir and at such a high level.
lowa State at this writing ap
pears, along with Minnesota, the
standout team of the nation.
Whether their victory over lowa is
but a flash in the pan or whether
the tremendous power indicated by
last week's 31 to 6 rout of lowa is
consistent will come to light when
lowa State plays Nebraska Saturday.
Minnesota, the team that beat
Pittsburgh after the Panthers had
handed Troy a 20 to 6 plastering, is
a team of proven power, with Illinois
its only threat in the race for the Big
Ten title. Ohio State, after eking out
a 10 to 7 win over Colgate, Saturday,
appears not In Minnesota's class. But
Illinois with Ohio State safely be
hind them is capable of repulsing the
Vikings.
Princeton Strong
The business of cut-throat foot
ball has progressed pretty completely
in the East, with Princeton, after
their scare in beating Washington
and Lee only 14 to 12, the likely
champion.
It is likely that Pittsburgh and
possibly Fordham might beat Prince
ton on a particular Saturday, but
Princeton's easy schedule will save
them a real test of their tremendous
power, unless they meet a Western
team December 8, as they plan.
lowa State appears capable of de
throning Nebraska, perennial Big
Six champs. While in the Southwest
Rice and Texas Christian will battle
for the championship of their sec
tion. Santa Clara will no doubt be

| rooting for Texas Christian, inas
much as that team meets the Broncs
in a post-season game at Fort Worth.
Southeast Prospects
Southern Methodist, which meets
Fordham Saturday, is a mighty
squad, but has a 9 to 0 defeat by
Rice to blot its record.
Louisiana State has played a 9
i to 9 tie with Rice, and Alabama, by
its 13 to (5 defeat of Tennessee Sat
i urday, joins them as favorites for
J the title of the Southeastern Coh
-1 ference.
Utah has a strangle hold on the
title in the Rocky Mountain district,
while Washington and Stanford
! stand out as prospective champions
on the Pacific Coast. Washington
State remains a threat; while South
j ern California, in the ruck for the
first time in many years, has only the
; hope for an upset to compensate a
rocky season.
