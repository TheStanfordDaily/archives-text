# Water Poloists Meet Troy Today
## CARDS FAVORITE TO TAKE SECOND CONFERENCE TILT 
### 
First place in the conference
standings will be the goal of Nort
Thornton's varsity water poloists
when they clash with U.S.C. in En
cina pools at 11 o'clock today.
The Indian aquatic stars will have
another prime reason for scalping
the Trojans, since the last game they I
lost in either league was to the
southerners two and a half years i
ago. Stanford is favored to settle |
that old score this morning, since the j
Trojans have a sophomore team, and j
the Cardinals looked better than 1
efer in their 9 to 0 victory over |
Lakeside Wednesday night.
Although Coach Fred Cady of i
U.S.C. has several prominent sVim- j
mers on his squad, there are no water J
polo players of known reputation. I
The visitors are sure to have a fast I
team, but there is a question con- '
! eerning their shooting, guarding, and i
passing akill. They should be much j
I more in the class of U.C.L.A., whom !
[ Stanford barely defeated, 3 to 2, than j
| in that of Lakeside.
j i
Coach Thornton regards the pres- i
' ent Card seven as the most powerful'
; team in Stanford history. Captain j
i Leo Cook is a strong candidate for j
! all-American honors this year, and!
' rates with Phil Daubenspeck, the i
'great L.A.A.C. forward, as one of j
j water polo's greats.
Bob Foster, swimming captain-!
| elect, has recovered from a severe!
cold, and will start at the other for- j
ward position. Foster was another |
who looked fine against Lakeside,
although the whole team starred in
| that game. Vlad "Bomber" Tara
nik, whose other nick-name is the
! "Red Raider" will open the game
as sprint. Taranik is the leading
I dead-eye of the squad on sudden,
i long shots.
Wally Wiget, Bill Woodard, and
Jim Benet at guards will present a
j stone-wall defense against the U.S.C.
j scoring threats. Bob Haslacher at
goalie, the only sophomore on the
; first string, played his best game to
date against Lakeside.
! This will be the Trojans' first game
I of the season and, as in football,
they're out to beat Stanford above
i everyone else. If they can spring
their star swimmer. Gene Fletcher,
j into the open, they may give the
j Indians plenty of trouble.
John Paulsen, Gordon Warner,

i and Cassius Perkiss are others who
will be distinct threats, if their water
polo compares with their swimming.
All students will again be admit
ted free of charge to this game, for
: which general admission will be 25
' cents.

cold, and will start at the other for- j
ward position. Foster was another |
who looked fine against Lakeside,
although the whole team starred in
| that game. Vlad "Bomber" Tara
nik, whose other nick-name is the
! "Red Raider" will open the game
as sprint. Taranik is the leading
I dead-eye of the squad on sudden,
i long shots.
Wally Wiget, Bill Woodard, and
Jim Benet at guards will present a
j stone-wall defense against the U.S.C.
j scoring threats. Bob Haslacher at
goalie, the only sophomore on the
; first string, played his best game to
date against Lakeside.
! This will be the Trojans' first game
I of the season and, as in football,
they're out to beat Stanford above
i everyone else. If they can spring
their star swimmer. Gene Fletcher,
j into the open, they may give the
j Indians plenty of trouble.
John Paulsen, Gordon Warner,

i and Cassius Perkiss are others who
will be distinct threats, if their water
polo compares with their swimming.
All students will again be admit
ted free of charge to this game, for
: which general admission will be 25
' cents.
First place in the conference
standings will be the goal of Nort
Thornton's varsity water poloists
when they clash with U.S.C. in En
cina pools at 11 o'clock today.
The Indian aquatic stars will have
another prime reason for scalping
the Trojans, since the last game they I
lost in either league was to the
southerners two and a half years i
ago. Stanford is favored to settle |
that old score this morning, since the j
Trojans have a sophomore team, and j
the Cardinals looked better than 1
efer in their 9 to 0 victory over |
Lakeside Wednesday night.
