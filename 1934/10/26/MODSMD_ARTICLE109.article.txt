Harry Wolter. About 25 of these are
varsity men, and the remaining 15
are frosh. Included among the 40
are five from the 11)34 varsity, one
transfer of varsity standing, and five
athletes now engaged in football and
basketball.
"Among the 15 men out for the
freshman team are three fine pitch
ers," stated Wolter, "and I think the
frosh prospects are better this year
' than for several past seasons.".
| The Indian mentor is not certain
I of his varsity prospects as yet, al
' though he intends to build his infield
I around Jim Woolley at second and
Frank Tremaine at short. These two
j are the only returning infielders
with letters from last year's nine.
I Bones Hamilton and Monk Moscrip
are leading candidates for two of
the outfield posts, but the third is in
doubt. Fred Heringer, Stan Ander
son, and Johnny Campbell are three
veteran pitchers, but either Heringer
lor Anderson may be used in some
j games as a catcher. These two ver
satile seniors are co-captains of the
