# Many Students to Work At S.C. Game Tomorrow
## 
### PHIL DUFFY 
Approximately 1,330 Stanford stu
dents and outsiders will take charge
of the almost-capacity crowd ex
pected for tomorrow's gridiron battle
between the Stanford Indians and
the Southern California Trojans, it
was announced by the Board of
Athletic Control.
Every student who had asked for
S.C. game employment by October
J. 6 was taken care of, and the re
maining jobs were given out to high
school students, junior college men,
and San Jose State students.
Most of the full-time jobs, which
last through the entire* game, have
been filled by unemployed veter
ans, alumni, and university em
ployes who have the day off, so that
the students who are working will
be given a chance to see at least part
of the contest.
There will be 504 ushers on hand
to direct patrons to their seats:
n«h«rs arc used tor an expected ca
pacity crowd. One hundred nineteen
ticket takers will collect the fans'
ducats, while 50 ticket salesmen will
take in $2.75 in exchange for "one

i good seat." Inside the gates 125 pro
| gram salesmen will add to the din
l by their lusty shouting.
In the vast territory surround
ing the stadium, 200 men will be en
, gaged in directing the flow of traf
fic, while 50 more will barricade the
' forbidden roads. Intermingling with
these 250 directors will be 60 student
police who will take care of the more
belligerent football fans.
Ten men will run the scoreboards
that always conflict with one's own
i ideas as to yardage gained or lost.
Five more will work on the public
address system, which enlightens the
less fortunate fan who does not know
the various rules or the individual
players.
The Red Cross department will be
I taken over by 12 students, and 135
1 will supply "the pause that re
freshes" with the various concession
booths around the oval.
All roads leading to the game will
be in good shape with the piece of
highway now under construction in
Mayfield open for use. The road
around the local golf course will also
be usable.
