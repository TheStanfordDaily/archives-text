# Soccer Squad Favored In San Jose State Game
## CARDINALS SHOW NEW CONFIDENCE DURING PRACTICE 
### 
Stanford is due to get out of the
cellar tomorrow as far as soccer is
concerned. Now down in the stand
ings with two games lost and none
won, the Cardinals should take a
step up by beating what seems to be
the weakest team in the conference
this yearâ€”San Jose State.
The game tomorrow is to be played
at 10 o'clock on the Stanford field.
As a preliminary, the frosh will
tangle with Galileo high at 9 o'clock.
And there will be a different spirit
on the playing field tomorrow. Prac
tice this week seems to have brought
about that feeling of confidence
among the team members that. Coach
Maloney tries so hard to instill in all
his squads. With a well-organized
team pitted against an outfit that
has been beaten repeatedly, a first
victory is in sight for the Cards.
Last week Maloney was looking
for 11 soccer players. He had 45 men
in which to seek but he was be
wildered. One day a carefully picked
team seemed to function fairly well
and the next would butch in a way
that, to say the least, was exasper
ating to the veteran coach.
Experiments were tried. Men
were .shifted to different positions
and finally the groove where every
man best fits seems to have been
found.
Waddy White, captain, has been
moved to center half, the key posi
tion of a soccer team where is the
responsibility of feeding the for
wards and aiding the backs. Dick
Bullis remains at right back but
Steve Enke is out of the left back
post, perhaps definitely. Bud Wilson,
a towering player who can also play
goal when called upon, now flanks
Bullis in the backfield.
Sawyer has been switched to out
side right and is showing up un
usually well in that position. Bob
Hall. Ruddy Gonzales, and Carl Eit
nier all have shown themselves to
fit into the halfback positions, and
John McClelland remains in the goal.
The forward wall under the new
set-up reads from right to left: Enke,
Row, Walker, Knecht, and Sawyer.
Still handicapping the soccer squad
are injuries and ineligibilities. Hank
Eversole is not yet eligible to play,
and A1 Navarro and Barney Vierling
are still out with injured knees.
