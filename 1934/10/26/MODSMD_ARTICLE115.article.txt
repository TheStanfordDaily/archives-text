# GOLF STARS WILL VIE FOR FAVORITE LADDER POSITIONS
## Three Men Hold National, State Championships 
### 
Preparing for their matches to be
held next Thursday, the central pegs
of the Stanford golf team, Lawson
Little, Tom Dwyer, Jack Hoerner
and Don Edwards are gradually
getting into condition that will make
their Thursday matches perfect,
spectacular, and altogether too in
teresting to predict their outcome.
These matches for ladder positions
bring together the winner of the
American and British Amateur golf
titles, Lawson Little and the Cali
fornia Junior champion and holder
of the Stanford course record, Tom
Dwyer. In the other match Don Ed
wards, runner-up in the recent Cali
fornia State Amateur meet, will play
Jack Hoerner, Nebraska State golf
champion.
The form shown by the partici
pants seems to show that thpy have
retained their late summer peak
thus far. Little hasn't played much
to date but has shown champion
ship form in the rounds that he has
played. In one round he played
even par despite the fact that he
suffered two penalty strokes.
Dwyer on the other hand seems
to be doing just as well. Though a
little careless in his practice rounds,
he still has the same shooting pre
cision that brought him the course
record in the qualifying rounds of
this year.
Hoerner Favored
Jack Hoerner has been seen very
little on the course but can be found
practicing somewhere almost every
afternoon. In the final summing up
of the differences between his game
and Edwards' it is apparent that ac
curacy with his irons to the same
degree that Edwards has attained,
will give him the match in a walk.
That is what he is striving for.
On the other hand Edwards has
been working on the course to se
cure perfection in his woods where
Hoerner's game reaches its high
point. Rated as one of the longest
drivers on the course, Hoerner has
created a real obstacle for Edwards
to erase off every tee on the course.
