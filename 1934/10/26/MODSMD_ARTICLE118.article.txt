# S.C., CARD BABE TEAMS LOOK TO VARSITY FUTURE
## 
### 
S.C. and Card frosh are not play
ing a game merely tor the sake of
a game, win or lose, tomorrow. They
are playing in preparation for three
years of Intercollegiate football, with
the possibility of some day making
All-American, or some day playing
in a Rose Bowl game.
It is remembered that today's
Varsity is largely the freshman team
of two years ago. Grayson, Hamilton,
Alustiza, Callaway, Reynolds, Mos
crip, Adams, Rouble, and a score of
others make up the '36 frosh squad.
In the class of '38 there are also
some boys who will be gracing var
sities in the future.
High School Stars
In the backfield are a dozen high
school, stars. Jimmy Coffis, stocky
S.F. Commerce High half, has shown
enough this season on the frosh to
i warrant considerable varsity play in
ihe next three years. He has tre
mendous legs and a powerful frame,
running like a package of spring
steel.
His running-mate at half, Tommy
Collins of Portland, is another good
bet for varsity. He has packed the
ball nicely and caught passes in all
of the frosh games, and is one of the
most consistent players on the team.
Bill Paulman and Glenn Hamilton
at full are a pair of triple-threaters.
Paulman's kicking is hardly ex
ceeded on the varsity, even with fel
lows like Alustiza and Anderson.
Both may see varsity play in a
couple of years.
In the line are a bunch of weighty
fellows, ten or a dozen of whom are
potential varsity timber. Continuing
the frosh policy of producing several
good ends each year, there are Bob
Dakan, Grant Stone, Berneth Layer,
Johnny Wyeth, and Red Peters
playing on the flanks. Stone and
Dakan are both large enough for
any varsity, and have shown the
ability to take out the opposing
tackle and tear down to get a half
back.
At tackle Irv Heningson and Cy

Oberg have gotten the call over the i
! others. Bqth are the rangy type, i
handling their offensive and defen- |
sive assignments to advantage.
Holridge, McKinney, and Partridge l
have proven the best guards. Hoi- !
ridge is not a man mountain by j
any means, but is strongly knit and j
has the speed to pull out and lead the J
interference, in which he excels.
S.C. Looks Good
Down at U.S.C. Frosh Coach JefT '
Cravath has a likely-looking bunch !
of ex-high school captains for his I
yearling squad.
A lot has been said of the great j
work of two Trobabe backs, Art ;
Stranske and Nick Pappas. Stranske, ;
big fullback from Santa Ana, is one !
of the shots of the team, and will
undoubtedly be heard from next
year. Pappas, a Seattle boy playing i
quarter, is another of the Mohler-
Williams-DufTield type, and is a
demon at open-field running and I
punt-returning.
They are calling Bill Gaisford, 1
frosh end, one of the best on the I
j campus, and he has a good chance to |
play first string next year. Two
i other promising ends are George !
i Bettinger and Bill Williams.
Standouts in the line are Bob Reed,
center; Ed Shuey, guard, and Lind
! say Ball, tackle.
