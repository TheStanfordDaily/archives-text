# Band Plans Fancy Drill
## 
### 
The best performance of the sea
son so far is promised by Stanford's
band, some HO musicians strong, in
the stadium Saturday afternoon as a
part of the traditional Indian-Trojan
tangle.
The snappy red-coated band will
stage a fancy marching exhibition on
Ihe field before the game begins,
according to the plans of Band Man
ager George Britton. The bandsmen
have been practicing marching stunts
for several weeks and an excellent
showing is promised. Among the
stunts, the details of which have not
been divulged, will be included the
forming of letters while on the
march.
No definite word had been re
ceived by the band late yesterday re
garding whether the Trojan band
will come up for the game, though
il is understood that the famed U.S.C.
musicians will be here.
The old "Trojan Horse" song will
boom out across the Stadium Sat
urday, according to plans.
Purdue University recently opened
a self-supporting airport, fully
equipped for night landing.
