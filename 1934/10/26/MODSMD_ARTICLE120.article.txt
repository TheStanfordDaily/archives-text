# INDIANS' FAVORED POSITION RECALLS DEBACLE OF 1930
## 
### 
Never since 1930 have previous
games made the Cards such heavy
favorites to defeat the Trojans. That
year U.S.C. licked the Indians 41-12,
one of the most decisive wins in the
history of grid competition between
the two schools.
Shortly before that Stanford -
U.S.C. game in 1930 Dink Templeton,
writing in a San Francisco news
paper, spoke of tackle Bob Hall of
the Thundering Herd as "a fine piece
of statuary." Howard Jones shortly
had the squib placed on the bulletin
board of the Trojans' training quar
ters, and the S.C. followers indig
nantly used the "statuary" note as
a rally cry. By the time the Trojan
eleven reached the Stanford Stadium
they were fighting mad, and the taste
of that 41-12 defeat was mighty bitter
for the Cards.
Troy Record Low
Tomorrow the Trojans will enter
the game with a record as far below
that of the Cards as they did in
1930 —a pitiful x - ecord for the mighty
Trojans of a year or two ago. S.C.
has been ragged for the Hollywood
"influence" which has destroyed the
■S.C. morale; last week they were
vigorously denounced for quibbling
about the colleges of Northern Cali
fornia grabbing the best of the prep
material from their territory.
Newspapers have decried the Tro
jans for their football play, resort
ing to such time-worn word twisters
as the "Blundering Herd."
