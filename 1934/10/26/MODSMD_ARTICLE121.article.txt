## 
### 
If there is anyone on the Stan
ford campus who is busier than
Coach Tiny Thornhill, the reporter
would hate to look for him. The
, huge, genial Card grid mentor was
; in San Francisco until mid-afternoon
! of the day he was sought by the
Daily for his life history. Once back
I from the City, he wasted no time in
getting out to a long varsity football
j practice.
In fact, Tiny told his lire story
1 while changing , from street clothes
into his football outfit.
Thornhill was born at Richmond,
Virginia, on April 14, 1893, but does
n't look all of his 41 years. At high
I school in Beaver, Pennsylvania, from
i 1908 until 1910, Tiny was a fullback,
| but in prep school at Mercersburg
I Academy the next two years he
played tackle as well. "I got too fat
| and slow for a star fullback," said
the big coach, with a laugh.
Tiny entered the University of
Pittsburgh in 1913 and played for
I that season and the next under Joe
Duff, former all-American guard at
Princeton. In 1915 and 1916, how
-1 ever, Tiny's boss was Pop Warner,
who later hud Tiny's valuable help
for 11 years at Stanford. Thornhill
was an all-American tackle at Pitt
in his senior year, but one would
never know it from talking to him.
After his graduation in the spring
of 1917, Tiny worked for three
; months at his profession of mining
j engineer, and then became line
coach for his alma mater.
Coming to Stanford in 1922, Tiny
was Pop Warner's line coach for 11
years, but when Pop went to Temple
a year and a half ago, Thornhill
stepped into his place and is now in
his second season. Last fall he made
' a fine start by compiling a record of

eight wins, two defeats, and one tie.
He beat both U.S.C. and California
for the first time in many years,
and he led Stanford into ihe Rose
Bowl.
Governor Merriam defeated Sin
clair in a straw ballot taken at the
San Francisco State Teachers Col
lege.

The crass-country run between
Stanford and San Mateo Junior Col
' lege track teams, originally slated for
' tomoiTow, has been postponed a
' week.
