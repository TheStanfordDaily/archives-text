# LAMSON TRIAL CAMPAIGN SET
## 400 Pledge Fervent Aid In New Defense Trial 
### 
Over 400 persons thronged the au
ditorium of the Masonic Temple in
Palo Alto last evening in a mass
j meeting to form plans for the de
fense of David Lamson, convicted
] former Stanford man who was re
cently awarded a new trial by the
state Supreme Court.
Fervent pleas for all present to
take an active part in the campaign
were put forth by all the speakers,
which included Kathleen Norris, Dr.
' William Paul Reagor, Rabbi Ru
dolph I. Coffee, Rev. Jason Noble
Pierce and Yvor Winters.
A written message from Dr. Au
gust Vollmer, famed criminologist
of the University of California, and
addressed to the meeting, stated:
j "The evidence presented in the orig
inal trial of David Lamson was not
incriminating enough to even cause
his arrest, and in reality proved his
innocence."
Nearly all the speakers made it
clear that, they had only recently be
come vitally interested in the case,
feeling sure that Lamson had been
convicted by a wave of hasty, false
public opinion.
Cards were passed among (hose al
tending the meeting on which the
several hundred persons pledged
themselves to disseminate informa
tion concerning the case, to make
personal subscriptions to the Lamson
defense fund, and to organize group
meetings at which actual information
concerning the case could be spread.
Nearly half of those present orally
pledged themselves to write letters
to the district attorney of Santa
Clara county asking that a new trial
not be held.
The meeting of the History Club
will be held Wednesday.
