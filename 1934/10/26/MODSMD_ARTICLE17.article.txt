# Emotional Crisis Looms As U.C. Co-eds Strike
## (SPECIAL TO THE DAILY) 
### 
BERKELEY, Calif., Oct. 25 (/P).
The Bears had better beat the Hus
kies tomorrow by at least one touch
down if an emotional crisis is to be
averted on the Berkeley campus, be
cause:
A recently organized Women V
Auxiliary to the Football Team has
officially started a strike on all "kiss
ing, necking, and using lipstick" un
til Ingram's men have won a confer
ence game by a seven-point margin,
according to Barbara ShurtlifT, presi
dent of the auxiliary.
Han Dates, Manicures
Helen Chapman, enforcement of
ficer of the auxiliary, and other
members promptly added the edict
banning dates, cutting classes, cig
arettes, candy, manicures, marcels,
haircuts, or trimming fingernails
while the strike is on.
It all started when certain femi
nine members of the staff of the
Daily California decided to us:
this method of dispelling rumors that
I lie campus was disloyal to the team

and Coach Ingram.
Members of the club chose a clas
sical basis for its organization, and
paraphrased the famous "Lysistrata"
of Aristophanes, in which the women
of Athens walked out to end war.
Picket Non-Supporters
Indications of a general '"walkout"
by all California women appeared
probable tonight as rumors spread
that unco-operative sorority houses
would be picketed.
Male members of the campus
viewed with dismay the progress of
the strike, as the week-end neared.
Only the football team seemed to
be pleased with the stoicism of the
girls, particulaily as their Saturday
game with Washington will keep
them far from the Berkeley campus
this week-end, and no danger of
throat-cutting while they were away
loomed.
When two coeds announced that
they would not clean their white
shoes during the strike, a critic, after
one look at the shoes, predicted an
early settlement.
