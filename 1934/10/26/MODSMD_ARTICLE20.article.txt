# Heavy Rains Threaten To Flood Washington
## 
### 
SEATTLE, Oct. 25 (/!»). —An omi
nous patter of rain whispered "dan
ger" to Western Washington tonight
as serious floods, on the heels of a
severe hurricane, threatened the
region.
A record rainfall for October and
melting snows overflowed rivers,
inundated highways, flooded streets
and sent, water to lap hungrily at
dikes and pile up log jams that
menaced bridges. There was no let
up in the rain and more was fore
cast .
