# Talks Given For Three Candidates
## Debaters Discuss Position Of Office Aspirants 
### 
An old-time political forum was
cnacted in the Little Theatre last
night, when the coming California
gubernatorial campaign was hashed
over before an enthusiastic capacity
audience. Each of the three candi
dates for the governorship dis
patched telegrams which were read
at the gathering.
The initial speech of the evening
was given by Dave MellinkofT for
Upton Sinclair. Mellinkoff gave
what was probably the most bril
liant speech of a distinguished foren
sic career.
Sinclair Defended
Lashing into the false accusations
commonly made against the Demo
cratic candidate, he asserted that
Sinclair is neither an atheist nor a
Communist, and practices Christian
principles to a greater extent than
does the present occupant of the gov
ernor's chair. ''The sales tax is the
modern Robin Hood," continued
MellinkofT. "It robs the poor to pay
the rich."
Packy McFai;land, speaking for
Governor Merriam, attacked Sinclair
as a man who espoused everything
from chiropracty to "mental tele
pathy." "Where will Sinclair get the
money to put his plans into effect,"
said the representative of the Repub
lican candidate, "when the bond is
sues of the state declined so mate
rially in value at the mere announce
ment of Sinclair's nomination?" Mc-
Farland said that he believed that
"under Governor Merriam we will
again return to times of prosperity."
Bright Favors Haighl
Raymond Haight was represented
by Andrew Bright. "Raymond
Haight," said Bright, "is the man who
most nearly represents the views of
the most of us; he is neither a reac
tionary nor a radical." Bright went
on to tell of the background and
record of the progressive candidate.
He also described Haight's liberal
and practical program.
The telegrams which the three
candidates for office sent follow:
From Governor Merriam's tele
gram: "I send greetings to the par
ticipants in the debate this evening.
. . . Those who will be fortunate
enough to be present will unques
tionably be convinced that it is nec
essary for all good citizens to . . .
cast their votes for the continuation
of good government."
Sinclair Interested
Upton Sinclair, Democratic candi
date, said in part: "Just learned with
pleasure of tonight's debate. I am
sure my plan to end poverty in
California will be ably presented.
1 shall be interested to learn the out
come."
Raymond Haight's telegram pro
gressive candidate, reads in part:
"The state of California as well as
the nation is in need of new leader
ship . . . We must look to the
younger generation for this leader
ship and the most logical place for
it to be developed i.s in the great
universities of this state."
