# Strength Makes Cards Favorites Against Trojans
## Hypothetical Cases Show How It Is Possible for Either Team To Win Tomorrow's Game; Both Teams Start Battle Devoid of Injuries 
### MILLARD BROWNE 
If light and the will to win are the only deciding factors, U.S.C. will
heat Stanford, but Stanford will also beat U.S.C. tomorrow afternoon.
And that couldn't be right.
So there will be a few other elements that enter into the final score of
the classic of gridiron combat between Howard Jones' Trojans and Tiny
Thomhill's favored Indians.

First of all, the actual power of
the two teams, together with the
football playing abilities of the indi
vidual contestants, will have a good
deal to do with the outcome of to
morrow's game in the Stanford Sta
dium.
The smoothness and alertness of
each eleven will be an important
factor.
Smart quarterbacking may decide
the game.
Breaks will add their share.
Cards Favored, But—
Only one of these many factors
finds Stanford with a pre-game rat
ing of superiority. That is point
number one—the team and individ
ual power—and that rating is the
basis on which the Cardinals arc
rated betting favorites over U.S.C.,
the team that has never lost a game
on Northern California soil, and the
same team that incidentally has
never lost to Stanford when the
Indians were favored.
So with Stanford freely considei'ed
to have the better of the argument
in that one department — technical
gridiron skill—Troy will devote sixty
minutes of football to gaining the
upper hand in one of the little things
that have decided so many past
games.
Southern California will begin at
2 o'clock tomorrow its plan of beat
ing Stanford to the breaks, out
clicking an Indian team that is bound
to be clicking as it has not done this
season, out-smarting the field gen
eraling of Bobby Grayson, and out
fighting a group of Cardinals that
decided early this year this would
be the one game in which they
really would give a demonstration
of spirit.
Will Make Breaks
The first quarter of Saturday's
game probably will not be played
in the old time manner of kicking
and waiting for breaks. Each team
is determined to get the jump in
scoring, and each will devote quite
some time to making its own breaks.
U.S.C. would put Stanford in a
decidedly awkward hole if she
should happen to score early. Troy
has a good defense, and the Cards
might get a bit panicky if they arc
behind. So Troy has decided that
four minutes after the game opens,
she will permit Irvine "Cotton-top"
Warburton, the only All-Amcrican
in the game, to catch an Alustiza
punt on his own 47-yard line and
dash to a touchdown. (A purely
hypothetical case).
Indians Chuckle
The Trojans will be fighting, but,
think the Indians, with a significant
chuckle, what if Stanford should
happen to slip one over in the first
quarter? Wouldn't thai kind of
break the Troy spirit, just a little bi.t?
So Bobby Grayson, with but four
minutes of the game gone, will break
through tackle on his own 35, cross
the 50. and then flip a lateral pass
lo Bones Hamilton for the touch
down. (Also a dream, not insured.)
The remainder of the strategy will
be left to the regular coaches.
Stanford will be in the game full
strength. Ali the Card sick men are
back, no longer injured. The starting
lineup, although not confirmed as
official by Coach Thornhill. will in
clude the best possible Stanford
team.
Troy will also come to Stanford
with an injury-Iree eleven. The reg
ular Maroon first string will open,
except that. Warburton will be saved
until a few minutes after the con
test opens, as is Jones' custom.

If light and the will to win are the only deciding factors, U.S.C. will
heat Stanford, but Stanford will also beat U.S.C. tomorrow afternoon.
And that couldn't be right.
So there will be a few other elements that enter into the final score of
the classic of gridiron combat between Howard Jones' Trojans and Tiny
Thomhill's favored Indians.

First of all, the actual power of
the two teams, together with the
football playing abilities of the indi
vidual contestants, will have a good
deal to do with the outcome of to
morrow's game in the Stanford Sta
dium.
The smoothness and alertness of
each eleven will be an important
factor.
Smart quarterbacking may decide
the game.
Breaks will add their share.
Cards Favored, But—
Only one of these many factors
finds Stanford with a pre-game rat
ing of superiority. That is point
number one—the team and individ
ual power—and that rating is the
basis on which the Cardinals arc
rated betting favorites over U.S.C.,
the team that has never lost a game
on Northern California soil, and the
same team that incidentally has
never lost to Stanford when the
Indians were favored.
So with Stanford freely considei'ed
to have the better of the argument
in that one department — technical
gridiron skill—Troy will devote sixty
minutes of football to gaining the
upper hand in one of the little things
that have decided so many past
games.
Southern California will begin at
2 o'clock tomorrow its plan of beat
ing Stanford to the breaks, out
clicking an Indian team that is bound
to be clicking as it has not done this
season, out-smarting the field gen
eraling of Bobby Grayson, and out
fighting a group of Cardinals that
decided early this year this would
be the one game in which they
really would give a demonstration
of spirit.
Will Make Breaks
The first quarter of Saturday's
game probably will not be played
in the old time manner of kicking
and waiting for breaks. Each team
is determined to get the jump in
scoring, and each will devote quite
some time to making its own breaks.
U.S.C. would put Stanford in a
decidedly awkward hole if she
should happen to score early. Troy
has a good defense, and the Cards
might get a bit panicky if they arc
behind. So Troy has decided that
four minutes after the game opens,
she will permit Irvine "Cotton-top"
Warburton, the only All-Amcrican
in the game, to catch an Alustiza
punt on his own 47-yard line and
dash to a touchdown. (A purely
hypothetical case).
Indians Chuckle
The Trojans will be fighting, but,
think the Indians, with a significant
chuckle, what if Stanford should
happen to slip one over in the first
quarter? Wouldn't thai kind of
break the Troy spirit, just a little bi.t?
So Bobby Grayson, with but four
minutes of the game gone, will break
through tackle on his own 35, cross
the 50. and then flip a lateral pass
lo Bones Hamilton for the touch
down. (Also a dream, not insured.)
The remainder of the strategy will
be left to the regular coaches.
