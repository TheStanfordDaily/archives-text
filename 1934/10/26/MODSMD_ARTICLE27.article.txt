Stanford students have decided in one ;

California and that the Farm shall have a Big

Last year, a "conservative" campus vetoed :
the annual blaze of glory and worried more \
ahout local politics than anything resembling
this mad, muck-and-niud-slinging proposition j
referred to in polite circles as a "gubernatorial :
campaign."
Stanford is politically "conscious." Eight j
hundred students and two hundred faculty |
members (only six hundred-voted in vestcr- ;
day's regular campus elections) went to the !
polls in the l).\iLY-conducled straw ballot of 1
the campus. Stanford men and women, with i
the rest of the American public, have been i
reading the newspapers. Which, in itself, is
not (ipso facto) terrifically poor judgment.
One must be informed, and therefore the j
newspaper.
California newspapers have gone hog-wild
on all tangents of the subject, printing items ,
daily (true or false) that far outdo anything
that would commonly come under the head
of "libel" in normal times.
Hut California, the state, is not by any :
means in a condition akin to normalcy, if '
normalcy refers to clear, sane thought by a ,
majority of its people. •
Forgetting how to think clearly, even more j
so as the fearful election day draws ever j
closer, the California electorate is most con- j
fused. Clever propaganda has done its share, ;
and we turn somersaults to inquire, "Are we 1
coming or going?"
California will not enter immediate bank- |
ruptcv if any one of three candidates is elected. !
And one of them will, naturally, sit under that j
while dome in Sacramento very soon. Not ;
even the man in the big yellow moon could >
venture a good guess as to the probable out
come.
Anyway, the campaign seems to be con- j
ducted more on the basis of tearing apart the ;
character of one man rather than playing up
the good points of the others.
There's plenty to be read between the lines '
these days, and although Stanford frowns on
the sideshow tactics of Mr. Sinclair in his
remarks concerning the Farm as a place to
be educated, one can't say who's going to be I
what in partictilaV after November (>.

day's regular campus elections) went to the !
polls in the l).\iLY-conducled straw ballot of 1
the campus. Stanford men and women, with i
