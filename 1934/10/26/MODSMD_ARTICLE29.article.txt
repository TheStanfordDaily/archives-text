California again crashes through wilh front
page news as the publicity-minded stall' of
the Daily Calif or nian announces a strike of
modern proportions that, if actually carried
out, would put to shame famed Aristophanes'
"Lysistrala" of (ireeian days.
Lysislrala and her cohorts walked out on
the men of the times in order to put an end
to wars. California coeds demand that the
Ciolden Bear varsity win by at least seven
pointsâ€”and announce a "kiss, necking, and
lipstick" strike until such a time may come.
Although further comment is probably use
loss and unnecessary, the Daily glances across
the bay with a telescopic eye and begins to
wonder. California's student body, according
to Daily Californian Editor Waller Christie,
.Jr., is most conservative. Could it, then, pos
sibly tolerale such practices even if a super
varsity did produce those extra seven digits?
