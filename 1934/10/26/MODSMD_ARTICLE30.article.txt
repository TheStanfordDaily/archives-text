# The 						Bonus Again
## 
### 
Flying in Ihe lace of public sentiment, the
American Legion in current national conven
tion at Miami has announced its intention of
plumping for immediate cash payment of the
veterans' bonus certificates. The Legion's de
cision is one repugnant to the convictions of
the President of the tinted States and his
immediate predecessor as well as most com
petent critics not tied to the apron strings of
political prestige and the attendant necessity
of hu inoring the mob.
The present tangle is not a question of
granting a bonus, but rather of paying imme
diately ;i bonus which was originally granted
with maturity set for a future date. In other
words, the Legion would seek to impair the
Treasury's credit structure and administra
tion plans for national recovery in the selfish
furtherance of their own private aims.
Such a proposition is not what we would
expect from an ostensibly patriotic organi
zation; neither is it good common sense. Some
day we hope the American Legion and other
militant minorities of the same stripe will
acknowledge that America's strength and re
covery lies in unity of effort and singleness
of goal, not in disorganized, self-centered chis
eling by petty groups.
