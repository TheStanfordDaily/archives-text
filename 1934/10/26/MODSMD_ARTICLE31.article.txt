# Thornhill, Jones, and Tally-Ho
## 
### 
With the Southern California - Stanford
grid clash only one day off, Coach Howard
â€¢Jones is hunting for a halfback and Coach
"Tiny" Thornhill is hunting for an inspira
tion, but Indian yell-leader Jimmy Triolo is
in a much more difficult predicament. He is
hunting for a megaphone, his one and only
Rally Committee tin horn which he has un
fortunately mislaid.
And what is a yell-leader without a mega
phone? II is the symbol, indeed the insepa
rable badge of his calling, or rather of his
hoarse exhortations. We trust quick-quipping
yellman Triolo finds the instrument, reposing
comfortably in some freshman's room.
