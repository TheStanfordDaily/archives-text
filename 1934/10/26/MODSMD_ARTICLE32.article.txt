# VIEWING THE NEWS
## WITH DAVID ERNEST FAVILLE 
### JOHN McCLELLAND 
Last Wednesday evening va.st Constitutional Hall in
Washington, D.C., was jammed with members of the
American Bankers Association. They had come to hear
President Roosevelt, as a representative of the Admin
istration, tell them, as representatives of American
business, what and when will be the next steps toward
business recovery. They were treated to some of the
rarest generalities in a year and a half of generalities
filling Roosevelt speeches.
Roosevelt praised the profit system. Roosevelt
promised relief would taper off as business improved.
And Roosevelt promised federal lending agencies would
cease in proportion as the banks resumed their ac
tivities.
David Ernest Faville, of the Graduate School of
Business, read the speech once and came to the con
clusion that doubtless came to the vast assemblage of
bankers in Constitution Hall. That Roosevelt, with
November 7, election day, in the offiing, was putting
American business men off lightly until that so
necessary congressional majority was again obtained.
Associate Professor Faville saw soft soap in the
praise of the profit system, evasion of the issue in the
promises.
How can bankers be expected to go ahead and make
the long-time loans that the President urges when
there is no stabilization of the dollar in sight? Roose
velt offered them no assurance that the money they
loan will not change in value during the time lapse of
the loan.
The chief executive must take a definite stand on
the monetary policy and come out in favor of stabiliza
tion of currency before business can resume the so
called normal functioning, Faville believes.
The speech to the bankers did not necessarily imply
that he did not. recognize the business man. In fact,
his praise of the profit system indicates that Roosevelt
is very much interested in business and, perhaps, has
taken something of a turn to the right.
Faville believes that stabilization of currency is in
sight. There are efforts being made to bring the
English pound back to normal and all general pros
pects appear better than during the summer.
Probably the bankers back in Washington felt as
Faville does. Perhaps they, too, realized that all
speeches between mid-summer and November 7 must
be discounted in view of elections and took not too
seriously the failure of the President to speak on what
they are most vitally interested in -stabilization of
the dollar.
