Some New Plays on Broadway
Divided by Three (Beatrice Kauf
man and Margaret Leech) is less a
play in the accepted sense of the
term, than a series of scenes ar
ranged for emotional reaction, but
lacking any essential form or climax.
And while the authors fail to dem
onstrate any superiority in such a
method, they have shown excellent
taste in not attempting to force hu
mour into the play.
As performed by an excellent com
pany under the ever expert direction
of the producer, Guthrie McClintic,
and with the particular aid of Judith
Anderson, it is an interesting and
occasionally moving play. The ex
treme naturalness and ease of the
players makes for a seeming effort
lessness which is as satisfyingly dra
matic as the play is unsatisfyingly so.
Dodsworth, adapted by Sydney
Howard from the Lewis novel, has
resumed its run after a summer va
cation. I found it an expert piece of
craftsmanship and an excellent an
swer to the old suggestion that novels
cannot be dramatized with success.
The playing ol Walter Huston and
Fay Bainter is splendid and the play
has several very moving scenes,
notabl}' the one in which Dodsworth
returns to his old office only to
discover that he has been forgotten
and is now something of a nuisance
where before he was a respected
tyrant.
Jo Melziener's settings deserve a
word of particular praise. The use
of movable stages of various de
scriptions is so common a phenoma
non here that the mere fact of their
existence is not a fact of particular
note. But the taste and beauty of
Melziener's sets added to the excel
lence of his mechanics in shifting
them, is a particularly happy com
bination.
Judgment Day. while not a good
play, is an intensely exciting one.
Its faintly-masked concern is the
Reichstag fire trial in all of its big
otry and fury. And Rice's neces
sarily prejudiced handling of the
matter together with his keen sense
of the theatrical, makes a provoking
and noisy evening in the theatre, if
not a memorable one.
The play itself is badly constructed
£-nd uneven as most plays set alto
gether in a court room must, by the
necessity of repetition, be. And
Rice's direction has not been as ex
pert as one might hope. Twice he
smothers his scene climaxes by per
mitting two points of interest to di
vert the onlooker from an apprehen
sion of much more than noise and
bustle. But the play, for all of its
faults, makes even so mild a social
scientist and humanitarian as my
self, boil with indignation and go
out of the theatre after the triumph
ant climax, nodding my head de
cisively and muttering against in
justice.
The D'Oyly Carte Company con
tinues in as great favor as ever, the
supply of Gilbert and Sullivan wor
shippers never seeming to decrease.
The SRO sign at the Martin Beck is
now a mere shred; it has been used
so frequently since September. And
even so moderately amusing a show
as Sailor Beware ploughs as gaily
into a second-year here.
Merrily We Roll Along is the
town's dramatic smash, despite a
mixed critical reception; The Distaff
Side, I am happy to report, enjoys
excellent business :and the revue,
Life Begins at 8:40. housed in the
large Winter Garden, regularly tops
all grosses for stage attractions.
Max Rubinoff is the impressario of
the Cosmopolitan Opera Company
which is offering a curious and in
teresting repertoire at the Hippo
drome to good business. Sigrid One
gin, Armand Tokatyan, Anne Ro
selle, and several equally substan
tial but less well-known singers are
among the leads. And more and
more openings are announced.

Some New Plays on Broadway
Divided by Three (Beatrice Kauf
man and Margaret Leech) is less a
play in the accepted sense of the
term, than a series of scenes ar
ranged for emotional reaction, but
lacking any essential form or climax.
And while the authors fail to dem
onstrate any superiority in such a
method, they have shown excellent
taste in not attempting to force hu
mour into the play.
As performed by an excellent com
pany under the ever expert direction
of the producer, Guthrie McClintic,
and with the particular aid of Judith
Anderson, it is an interesting and
occasionally moving play. The ex
treme naturalness and ease of the
players makes for a seeming effort
lessness which is as satisfyingly dra
matic as the play is unsatisfyingly so.
Dodsworth, adapted by Sydney
Howard from the Lewis novel, has
resumed its run after a summer va
cation. I found it an expert piece of
craftsmanship and an excellent an
swer to the old suggestion that novels
cannot be dramatized with success.
The playing ol Walter Huston and
Fay Bainter is splendid and the play
has several very moving scenes,
notabl}' the one in which Dodsworth
returns to his old office only to
discover that he has been forgotten
and is now something of a nuisance
where before he was a respected
tyrant.
Jo Melziener's settings deserve a
word of particular praise. The use
of movable stages of various de
scriptions is so common a phenoma
non here that the mere fact of their
existence is not a fact of particular
note. But the taste and beauty of
