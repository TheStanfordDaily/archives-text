# BULL SESSION
## THE 						STRAW VOTE AND HOW TO READ IT 
### 
The most wonderful thing about i
football games is that they can prove
everybody right—except the people
who bet on them. There was a time
when the Big Red Machine gained j
"moral victories"—and was proud
of them. At the same time S.C. was
gaining real victories—and was also
happy over them. The Alpha Delts
turn out to see Van Dellen; the Zetes
to see Hamilton; the Kappas to stare
at the Pi Phis, and vice versa. Every
body is happy.
. !
The same thing is true of straw
votes. Everyone sees something dif
ferent in the results. The Daily re
porter of yesterday was happy that
the Epic plan had gone down to the
count of six to one. And you can
bet everything you own that Com
munists are gloating today over the
fact that two votes were registered
for Darcy. What did the Sinclairites
and the Haights see in yesterday's 1
balloting?
They began mumbling something
like this: "Stanford is the home of i
conservative Republicanism. How do
we know that? Don't ask ridiculous
questions. But if you must be con
vinced, recall that in 1928 the cam- 1
pus straw-voted 75 per cent for the |
Republican party; and in '32 when
poor old Bolivar had a mouse up his
trunk—63 per cent of Stanford stu- .
dents still stuck by the Grand Old '
Party.
"Now in the present gubernatorial j
campaign, Frank Merriam represents ;
conservative Republicanism. True, I
he may lack the poise and intelli- I
gence that often goes with that group, ;
but still he is one of them, whether
they like it or not.
"But in the campus poll, the fac
ulty gave Mr. Merriam but 50 per
cent of their votes, and plumped the |
other 50 per cent for Sinclair and
Haight. And in the general Farm
tally (students and faculty com
bined), Merriam got 54 per cent of
the votes; his two opponents 46 per
cent.
No matter how you look at it—if
if you keep your eyes open—that
vote is definite indication that at
least about one-half of the campus
is a bit tired of the Merriam brand

of politics. Republicans may be con
soled that their man DID get 54 per
cent of the vote; but then, this IS
Stanford, and not the great plains, or
the great cities, or the great mass of
the voting public. Of course, this
may not help Sinclair, but what of
'36?"
This thing started off talking about
football, and on the Friday before
S.C. it was probably foolish to let it
drift into politics. For at the real
"Big Game" — tomorrow — politics
will be adjourned. Republicans,
Democrats, Haightmen, yes—prob- I
ably even Communists—will cheer
for a Stanford victory.

"Now in the present gubernatorial j
campaign, Frank Merriam represents ;
conservative Republicanism. True, I
he may lack the poise and intelli- I
gence that often goes with that group, ;
but still he is one of them, whether
they like it or not.
"But in the campus poll, the fac
ulty gave Mr. Merriam but 50 per
cent of their votes, and plumped the |
other 50 per cent for Sinclair and
Haight. And in the general Farm
tally (students and faculty com
bined), Merriam got 54 per cent of
the votes; his two opponents 46 per
cent.
No matter how you look at it—if
if you keep your eyes open—that
vote is definite indication that at
least about one-half of the campus
is a bit tired of the Merriam brand

of politics. Republicans may be con
soled that their man DID get 54 per
cent of the vote; but then, this IS
Stanford, and not the great plains, or
the great cities, or the great mass of
the voting public. Of course, this
may not help Sinclair, but what of
'36?"
This thing started off talking about
football, and on the Friday before
S.C. it was probably foolish to let it
drift into politics. For at the real
"Big Game" — tomorrow — politics
will be adjourned. Republicans,
Democrats, Haightmen, yes—prob- I
ably even Communists—will cheer
for a Stanford victory.

The most wonderful thing about i
football games is that they can prove
everybody right—except the people
who bet on them. There was a time
when the Big Red Machine gained j
"moral victories"—and was proud
of them. At the same time S.C. was
gaining real victories—and was also
happy over them. The Alpha Delts
turn out to see Van Dellen; the Zetes
to see Hamilton; the Kappas to stare
at the Pi Phis, and vice versa. Every
body is happy.

The same thing is true of straw
votes. Everyone sees something dif
ferent in the results. The Daily re
porter of yesterday was happy that
the Epic plan had gone down to the
count of six to one. And you can
bet everything you own that Com
munists are gloating today over the
fact that two votes were registered
for Darcy. What did the Sinclairites
and the Haights see in yesterday's 1
balloting?
They began mumbling something
like this: "Stanford is the home of i
conservative Republicanism. How do
we know that? Don't ask ridiculous
questions. But if you must be con
vinced, recall that in 1928 the cam- 1
pus straw-voted 75 per cent for the |
Republican party; and in '32 when
poor old Bolivar had a mouse up his
trunk—63 per cent of Stanford stu- .
dents still stuck by the Grand Old '
Party.
