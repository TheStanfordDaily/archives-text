# CAMPUS OPINION
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
NOW THAT outrageous, libelous,
derogatory story in a recent Waily
is entirely out of fashion —even in
1899, the Daily never dared to speak
to the Chappie like that. I refer to
the egoistic remarks by the staff of
your Awful Rag, indicating that they
consider themselves worthy and ca
able of competing with the valiant
Chappie Lads on the turf. It's tur
fific! Egad, sir! it is preposterous—
not to say impossible. I doubt
whether you can gather together 11
men tried (not to say true) who are
brawny, much less brainy, enough
to cope even with our business man
ager alone. Nevertheless, your co
lossal nerve has our collective blood
a-boilin* and, sir, we throw down the
gauntlet—ours, since you probably
haven't one. A CHALLENGE to
you weak listers —you disgrace to
journalistic ethics—from the virile,
upright men of Hammer & Coffin.
We can lick you at forty spaces with
mr hands tied behind—editorially
ir physically. Phooey! and like ex
pressions.
Nov. 10th? It will take that long
or you to get into condition and
raid the south for material. The
Chappies will be ready —we lead
healthy, happy, model lives and are
n the best of form.
If I were not so perturbed, I would
aause to feel sorry for you on
10th.

rhe Editor, Sir:
Several days ago you published
he announcement of the Daily's
vithdrawal from the NRA. Believ
ng that perhaps such action was jus
ified by the present state of campus
>pinion, we kept our silence. Thanks,
lowever, to the substantial endorse
ment of Mr. Roosevelt's and the
T RA's policies as revealed in your
.olumns today, I believe that we
lave a right to demand that OUR
aaper, the Stanford Daily, be gov
>rned by such a clear evidence of
;upport to the present Administra
ion as has been revealed.
Is not the Daily a student publica
ion and are we not judged, upheld
ind condemned as a student body by
vhat this paper carries to the public?
In many cases there is room for
loubt and the editor should have a
ree hand in echoing what is, in his
udgment, general campus opinion.
3ut in this case the editor has cer
ain definite indications that the
najority of us want our paper to
support Mr. Roosevelt and the NRA.
wVil 1 you be kind enough to at least
?ive us your reasons for not so
loing?

rhe Editor, Sir:
Several days ago you published
he announcement of the Daily's
vithdrawal from the NRA. Believ
ng that perhaps such action was jus
ified by the present state of campus
>pinion, we kept our silence. Thanks,
lowever, to the substantial endorse
ment of Mr. Roosevelt's and the
T RA's policies as revealed in your
.olumns today, I believe that we
lave a right to demand that OUR
aaper, the Stanford Daily, be gov
>rned by such a clear evidence of
;upport to the present Administra
ion as has been revealed.
Is not the Daily a student publica
ion and are we not judged, upheld
ind condemned as a student body by
vhat this paper carries to the public?
In many cases there is room for
loubt and the editor should have a
ree hand in echoing what is, in his
udgment, general campus opinion.
3ut in this case the editor has cer
ain definite indications that the
najority of us want our paper to
support Mr. Roosevelt and the NRA.
wVil 1 you be kind enough to at least
?ive us your reasons for not so
loing?

The Editor, Sir:
NOW THAT outrageous, libelous,
derogatory story in a recent Waily
is entirely out of fashion —even in
1899, the Daily never dared to speak
to the Chappie like that. I refer to
the egoistic remarks by the staff of
your Awful Rag, indicating that they
consider themselves worthy and ca
able of competing with the valiant
Chappie Lads on the turf. It's tur
fific! Egad, sir! it is preposterous—
not to say impossible. I doubt
whether you can gather together 11
men tried (not to say true) who are
brawny, much less brainy, enough
to cope even with our business man
ager alone. Nevertheless, your co
lossal nerve has our collective blood
a-boilin* and, sir, we throw down the
gauntlet—ours, since you probably
haven't one. A CHALLENGE to
you weak listers —you disgrace to
journalistic ethics—from the virile,
upright men of Hammer & Coffin.
We can lick you at forty spaces with
mr hands tied behind—editorially
ir physically. Phooey! and like ex
pressions.
Nov. 10th? It will take that long
or you to get into condition and
raid the south for material. The
Chappies will be ready —we lead
healthy, happy, model lives and are
n the best of form.
If I were not so perturbed, I would
aause to feel sorry for you on
10th.
