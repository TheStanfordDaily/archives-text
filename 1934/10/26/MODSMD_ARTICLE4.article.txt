# Series Open With Songs By Cossacks
## Singers Appear Tuesday In Pavilion 
### 
A trained chorus of 36 male voices,
the Don Cossacks, wild-riding ex
oflicers of the Czar's Imperial Army,
v/ill appear in concert at the Pavil
ion Tuesday evening under the aus
pices of the A-S.S.U. Corjcert Series.
Organized in 1923 in a prison camp
near Constantinople, this band of
Russian singers has since given over
2,700 concerts throughout the world.
Singing in their native tongue the
Russian folk, songs they learned in
their youth, they accompany each
performance with shouts, whistling,
and frenzied dancing.
The Don Cossacks travel on
"Nansen" passports, issued by the
League of Nations to those with
out a country. No mention is made
of nationality on these passports,
just the words "en voyage" are
written in.
During a performance, the men
march upon the stage in military
formation, wearing their dark blue
Cossack uniforms, the trousers
trimmed with broad red stripes.
Knee-high leather riding boots serve
to remind that the Cossacks were a
cavalry unit.
These men have mastered every
variety of choral singing. Their
voices are renowned for their sono
rity and wild beauty. Unaccompan
ied, they sing song after song of the
beautiful Russian sacred music or
burst into stirring Cossack war mu
sic.
There arc still a number of
scats to be obtained for this con
cert, as well as season tickets.
Norman Barnes urges that stu
dents call at once at the Concert
Series office in the Old Union for
their tickets. Season books run from
$2 to $4, while single tickets for the
Don Cossack concert alone may be
obtained for $], $1.50, and $2.
