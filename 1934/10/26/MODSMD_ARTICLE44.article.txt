Thousands of dollars of damage was done along Seattle's lake and
harbor waterfronts when a 65-niile gale swept in from the sea. Above,
some of the wreckage, showing houseboats sunk and firemen rescuing
furniture and other property. Below, the sunken river steamer Har
vester barely sticking above the water and being wrecked by collision
with the liner President Madison. Tugs are seen trying to keep the Pdadi
son from crushing the freighter North Iliver. (Associated Press photos.)
