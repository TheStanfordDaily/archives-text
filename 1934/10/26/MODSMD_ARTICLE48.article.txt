# Triolo Is Woe-Begone! Lostâ€”One Megaphone
## 
### 
What is a game* without a yell
leader? And also, what is a yell
leader without a megaphone?
Jimmy Triolo is sending out an
S.O.S. call. His chief aid, the rnaga
phone, was lost last night at the pa
jamarino, possibly at the Stanford
Theatre. Jimmy asks that it be re
turned to room 334 Encina, if found.
