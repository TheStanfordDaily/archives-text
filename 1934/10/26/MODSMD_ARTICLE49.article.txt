# COLLEGE MEN PREFER CLOTHES MADE WITH INVISIBLE CLOSURE
## 
### 
Style experts and fashion authorities are
well aware that the preferences of college
men form an important and dependable in
dication of the trend in men's apparel.
One detail of men's clothing which until
now has never been satisfactory is the fly of
the trousers. The buttoned fly, no matter
how carefully made, is bulky because of the
extra fold of material required; it bulges and
wrinkles in a way that is most unsightly.
Theslide-fastened fly gives a much smooth
er and neater effect in front than is possible
with buttons, but the ordinary slide fastener
has an uncovered strip of metal that is ob
jectionable to men who take pride in being
well-dressed.
The ne\f invisible style-line closure, the
Kover-Zip fly, has every practical advantage
of the ordinary zipper, and in addition is
superior to it from the standpoint of good
taste because no metal shows —the units of the
fastener are concealed by a grosgrain ribbon
that harmonizes with the fabric of the trou
sers and is guaranteed to outlast the garment.
The Kover-Zip fly has been acclaimed and
adopted by "best-dressed" seniors in Amer
ica's foremost colleges, and a typical ex
pression of opinion about this invisible seam
line closure, the finest and most expensive
slide fastener made, is the following state
ment by Robert L. Henderson of Harvard,

class of 1934:
"The covered zipper
for the trouser fly is
the most practical and
stylish device yet hit
upon ... it does away
with the objectionable
strip of metal seen in
the ordinary zipper."
College men every-

where, from Cambridge to Palo Alto, welcomed
the Kover-Zip fly and now demand it alike
on dress trousers, informal suits and slacks.
Smooth and smart, efficient and durable,
Kover-Zip is the closure for all modern clothes.
