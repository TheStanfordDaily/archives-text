gaged in tri-power conversations
here, though cool to the equality
principle as outlined by Ambassa
dor T.suneo Matsurdaira and Admiral
Isoroku Yamamoto of Japan,
wanted to see the complete details
of Nippon's plan before accepting or
rejecting it.
Japanese Demands

tonnage level which they want to
substitute for the ratio system.
2. A specific cut in offensive type
ships such as battleships and air
craft carriers.
3. A provision that small cruisers
be the largest ships to bo built in

for unlimited building, within maxi
mum tonnage limits, of submarines

fensive in nature.
Classify Ships

on the classification of offensive and
defensive ships the point observers
believe most likely to start contro
versy because British and Americans
differ with the Japanese and be
tween themselves as to just what of
fensive weapons are.
Japan's demand for scrapping of
the Washington and London naval
treaties, with the 5-5-3 ratio em
bodied in the former, has. stirred

icans, Norman H. Davis and Admiral
William H. Standley, or among the
British, headed by Premier Ramsay
