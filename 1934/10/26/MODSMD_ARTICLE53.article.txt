# STANFORD SONGS
## COME JOIN THE BAND 
### 
Come, join the band,
And give a cheer for Stanford red;
Throughout the land
Our banner waving overhead;
Stanford, for you,
Each loyal comrade brave and true
With might and main sings this re
frain,
"Forever and forever Stanford
red."
After the game,
When Stanford red has won the
day,
Praising her name
Down on the field we'll force our
way
And on the green
Each man who joins Ihe serpentine
With might and main sings this re
frain,
"Forever and forever Stanford
red."
