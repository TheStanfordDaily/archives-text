# THE 						TROJAN HORSE
## 
### 
In the days of long ago the mighty
Trojan host
Held that they were the warriors
supreme:
But a little wooden horse upset their
haughty boast,
And their glory was only a dream.
Now the Trojans have a namesake
down at Southern Cal,
And they're boastful as boastful
can be;
But they're goin' to meet their mas
ter, for the Cardinal
Will play horse with old U.S.C.
