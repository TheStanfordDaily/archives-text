# HAIL, STANFORD, HAIL!
## 
### 
(the hymn)
( Where the rolling foothilLs rise
Up toward mountains higher,
Where at eve the Coast Range lies
In the sunset fire,
Flushing deep and paling,
Here we raise our voices, hailing
Thee, our Alma Mater.
Refrain
From the foothills to the bay
' It shall ring,
As we sing,
It shall ring and float away.
Hail, Stanford, Hail!
I Hail, Stanford, Hail!
i
I
Tender vistas ever new
Through the arches meet the eyes,
Where the red roofs rim the skies
j Flecked with cloudlets sailing,
Here we raise our voices, hailing
; Thee, our Alma Mater.
