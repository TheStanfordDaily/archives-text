Encina 4E and the Alpha Sigs bat
tled in the darkness of last night
settling touch football scoi'es, and it
all turned out 1 to 0 in favor of the
Encina team.
Earlier, on the same field, Break
ers had beaten Theta Delta Chi,
13 to 0. The Kappa Sigs had licked
El Capitan, 14 to 0, and Sequoia II
had bowed to Phi Psi, 24 to 7.
All had come, played, and retired;
but long after the sun had died, leav
ing the field in blackness and sight
of the ball a feat for the imagination,
the Encina men and Alpha Sigs
battled away.
Tie Played Off
Alternating possession of the ball
in ten plays from the 50-yard line,
first Alpha Sig and then Encina tried
to advance. When ten plays were

completed the ball was 30 yards on
the Alpha Sigs' side of the 50-yard 1
line and 70 yards from the Eneina '
goal line, as near as anybody could j
see, thereby entitling Encina to the j
over-time victory.
In its game against El Capitan, 1
Kappa Sigma uncovered an accu- 1
rate converter in Sheldon Allen, who
added the extra point after he had |
taken a pass from Jim Clark for the !
first touchdown. After Clark had
passed to Rollin McNitt for Kappa 1
Sig's second touchdown, Allan again '
converted.
The play of Harlan Carter and 1
Harold Bell in scoring a touchdown
each turned the tide in the Breakers'
favor over the Theta Delts.
In the Sequoia 11-Phi Psi game the |
potent combination of Ed Clark and !
"Tony" Cockins had all they could 1
do to bring Phi Psi ahead of Sequoia i
after Perry Dean had given the hall
boys the jump by a pass interception j
and an 80-yard run to Sequoia's one J
score of the game.
Clark's passing and Cockin's re-1
ceiving soon piled up 18 points for j
Phi Psi, however, and the total was I
run .to 24 before the game ended.
