# Hetch Hetchy To Be Opened On October 28
## Secretary of Interior Ickes Will Give Addresses 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 25 (A>).—
Utilizing a national park for the first
time in history as a watershed has
cost the City of San Francisco $100,-
000.000, very many anxious moments
and more than 25 years of work,
hut its successful outcome will be
marked on October 28.
With an address by Secretary of
the Interior Harold Ickes, the head
gates will be opened and a head of
00,000,000 gallons of water will pour
out of the west end of the Douglas
tunnel of-the Hetch Iletchy project
into Crystal Springs reservoir which
will store 22,500,000,000 gallons.
Eventually 400,000,000 gallons of
water will be available daily and a
vast power output created, all re
claimed from water previously wast
ed in San Francisco Bay.
Despite its huge expenditure 'the
city cannot take a single drop of
water out of any of the lakes or
rivers draining Yosemite National
Park which was not saved from
waste by the development.
Nor did Uncle Sam open up his
governmental playground to bo de
spoiled. He required the city to
build roads and trails which are
things of beauty — highways, the
city's engineers say, which rival the
ancient roads of Old Rome in artistry
and permanency—to construct dams
and other works which touch off
rather than detract from the scenic
beauty of the wonderland.
