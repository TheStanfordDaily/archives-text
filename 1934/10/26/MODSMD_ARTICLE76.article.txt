# VETERANS SEEK BONUS PAYMENT
## Belgrano Elected Leader; Will Direct Campaign 
### 
MIAMI, Oct. 25 (/P).â€” I The Ameri
can Legion today called upon the
Government Tor immediate payment
of the adjusted service (bonus) cer
tificates as a "most effective means"
of hastening national economic re
covery.
Belgrano Named
Frank Belgrano, San Francisco
banker, was unanimously chosen by
the veterans as their 1935 national
commander, succeeding Edward A.
Hayes of Decatur, 111. Belgrano will
direct the Legion's campaign t ob
tain the bonus at the next session
of Congress.
The. Senate has refused in the last
two years to authorize payment of
the bonus, although the House has
twice voted for the measure. Be
cause of the Senate stand, Adminis
tration chieftains in Washington be
lieve a veto would be upheld even
should the bonus be passed by Con
gress.
New Debt
Fulfillment of the convention's
"recommendation" would entail dis
bursement from the Federal Treas
ury of more than $2,000,000,000, but
this, the Legion held, "will not cre
ate an additional debt, but will dis
charge and retire an acknowledged
contract obligation of the Govern
ment."
The convention, in its closing ses
sion of the sixteenth annual meet
ing, also asked cancellation of in
terest charged against the certifi
cates for loans already made to vet
erans, and a refund of collections
made on this account.
