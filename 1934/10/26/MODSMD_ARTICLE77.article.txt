# HARRASSED EDITOR HUNTS LOST JOKES
## 
### 
Gordy Steedman, editor of the
Chaparral, is frantically scanning
the obituary columns in search of
someone who has laughed himself
to death, because he suspects that he
would be ths person who crept into
the Chappie office and stole all of
Steedman's "copy" for future issues.
"Not that we particularly mind
people stealing our jokes," he says.
"Other magazines have been doing
that to us for years, but they never
did it like this before."
A laboratory to assist children
with defective speech has been
planned at the University of Wichi
ta, Kansas.
