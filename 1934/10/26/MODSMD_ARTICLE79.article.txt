NEW YORK. Oct. 25 (/P).â€”Rail
roading's answer to aerial and auto
motive competition reached New
York today after a record-breaking j
run across the continent, and the j
ensuing excitement caused the en
gineer to faint.
Fifty-six hours and 55 minutes
after leaving Los Angeles, the Union
Pacific's new streamlined train, re- 1
sembling a huge yellow caterpillar,
rolled iqto Grand Central terminal 1
with a cluster of new speed records
to its credit. The previous trans- .
continental record was 69 hours and
seven minutes, made ten years ago.
Overcome by the press of welcom
ing crowds and the sudden easing of ,
the nervous strain under which he
had labored during the long exhibi
tion run, H. D. Robinson, assistant 1
motor car supervisor of the Union .
Pacific, fainted on the station plat- i
form.
The condition of Irving White, I
freshman student who suffered a se- j
vere concussion in an automobile |
accident, is still unchanged after five l
days. White has not yet regained
consciousness. J
