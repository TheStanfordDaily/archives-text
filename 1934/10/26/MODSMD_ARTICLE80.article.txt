# CONDON IDENTIFIES LINDY SUSPECT AS RANSOM RECIPIENT
## Prosecution To Claim Baby Met Death in Crib 
### 
TRENTON, N.J., Oct. 25 (A*).—'The
web ol evidence encircling Bruno
Hauptmann tightened today with the
disclosure that Dr. John F. Condon
had positively identified the German
carpenter as the man to whom he
paid the $50,000 ransom money.
Another startling development fol
lowed this by a few hours, an au
thoritative source revealing that the
State of New Jersey will contend in
the trial of the one-time machine
gunner that Baby Lindbergh was
brutally slain in his crib the night
of March 1, 1932.
The State, it was learned, will
contend that the infant's body was
carried down the ladder by which
the kidnaper gained access to the
second-story nursery of the Lind
bergh home at Hopewell, and bur
ied in a shallow grave two miles
away.
One high source said this conten
tion would not prevent the prosecu
tion's charging also that the child
was killed during the kidnaper's
flight down the ladder, or subse
quently. "It is nccessary to prove
the child met death in connection
with the burglary," it was stated.
"That is all."
Informed persons declined to re
veal whether the baby's crib was
blood-stained.
