# Cardinal-S. C. Tilt, Bear-Husky Game Head Week's Menu
## Saturday's Football Tussles May Upset League Race Dope 
### Craig Barbash 
The complexion of Pacific Coast
football look a definite hue of two
color's, the purple of Washington and
the cardinal of Stanford as the re
sult of games last week, and accord
ing to the dope on games tomorrow.
But by tomorrow night things may
be jumbled beyond repair for the
two leaders. Washington clashes with I
a snarling Golden Bear in ihe north- i
land and U.S.C. stakes its all for a j
successful season on polishing off i
Stanford.
Should either Stanford or Wash
ington suffer defeat, Washington
Stale and California loom as pos
sible champions of the Pacific Coast
Conference in spite of defeats in
non-conference competition.
Washington State tangles with a
stubborn Oregon State eleven to
morrow.
Stanford demands the favorite's
position in tomorrow's fracas with
the Trojans and seems not a bit
bashful in .taking it.
Washington, too, with her potent
backfield and none too yielding line
figures to hand California a beating
at Seattle. But the boys from Ber
keley are out to repeat with empha
sis their 33 to 0 victory of last year.
While the Coast is hotly engaged
in settling its fate internally, Oregon
will carry the prowess of Coast foot
ball to the home of the University
of Utah. There the Webfoots will
meet a stern test from the cham
pions of the Roeky Mountain Con
ference.
Undefeated Santa Clara tackles
Fresno State after the Fresno boys
have beaten Coach Stagg s Pacific,
and unless the Santa Clara team
reaches a top performance the Bron
cos appear to be in for a close game.
The California Aggies, after hold
ing Nevada even, still do not appear
in U.C.L.A.'s class this Saturday.
Idaho's tangle with Montana is a
thriller which promises intense
competition.
