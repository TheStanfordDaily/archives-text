# Troy Scribe Says U.S.C. Improving
## Thinks Jones Squad Can Upset Stanford 
### Dick Nash 
Sports Editor, Daily Trojan
If improvement means anything, El
Trojan is going to beat Chief Redskin
at Palo Alto tomorrow.
It was a pretty green gang that
Coach Howard Jones met on the first
day ot practice at Bovaid Field on
September 15 last. With only two
starting players back to grace the
lineup, it was little wonder that the
Head Man was a bit pessimistic when
he surveyed his material.
But you can't accuse Jones of
blaming any misfortune which
should overcome the Trojans on the
lack of either quality or quantity,
i "The material, though green, is there.
| Now it is up to the coaching staff to
j develop it," he said then, and says
; now.
Pacific Shows Up Troj
He started his second team against
| Occidental and had but little trouble
in defeating the Tigers, 20-0. In the
| second half of the double-bill he
used his first team against a not-so
strong Whit tier eleven and came out
on top, 40-14. Little concern regard
-1 ing the faults was shown; it was
1 only the Herd's first appearance.
Then Amos Alonzo Stagg brought
his fired-up College of Pacific Ben
gals south and it wasn't long until
Jones discovered that 1934 wasn't
going to be the easy sailing that 1931,
1932, and the first half of 1933 had
been. Six to nothing was the score !
and Troy considered itself very lucky i
to come out on top.
Faulty Against W.S.C.
A rejuvenated team faced Wash- I
ington State the next week, and a I
new all-time low was hit by the Tro- '
jans in losing to the Cougars, 19-0. j
| Faulty blocking, tackling, defensive j
work, was exhibited by the Cardinal j
i and Gold regulars as well as substi- j
tutes.
1 Traveling back to Pittsburgh for
the expected massacre, the Trojan
â–  team was revived. A new attitude
; took hold of the men which has i
: shown itself since. Despite the 20-6'
j defeat by the powerful Panthers,
i Southern California made its best
showing to date in the game with the
' Smoky City outfit.
j That Coach Jones' team only man-
I aged to tie Oregon State last week
' was unfortunate, for actually the
Trojans, playing still better than at
Pitt, showed much of the form that
brought national honors in previous
! years.
After scoring in the first five min
utes, the S.C. team went into its
shell to save all further nicks for
: the more important- game to come,
1 only using three plays from then on.
Even the Beavers will admit that
they were most fortunate in finally
! knotting the count with the aid of a
, fumble and a bobbed pass. 1
Thus, Southern California's season
to date: Not any too cheery, but one
that, shows continual improvement
since the W.S.C. debacle.
So we insist: If improvement
means anything. El Trojan is going
to beat Chief Redskin tomorrow.
Princeton, Yale, Penn, Rutgers and
LaFayette have recently formed an
Eastern Intercollegiate 150-pound
I Football League.
