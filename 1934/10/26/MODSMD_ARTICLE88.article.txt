# STANFORD HAS BETTER RECORD THAN TROJANS
## Indians Favored To Win On Basis of Comparative 1934 Scores 
### 
U.S.C.: Won three, lost two, and i
| tied one.
Stanford: Won four, tied one.
The mere grim, cold, black figures j
i show why Stanford is favored to- j
morrow. The great Troy warhorse j
j of the past is a slender slip of its i
j present self. Stanford has an im- i
! pressive record so far.
Howard Jones' men opened the
season with a double win, taking
Occidental 20-0, and Whittier 40-12.
The first hint of disaster came
when Amos Alonzo Rtagg's C.O.P. i
! battlers went south and held the j
: Trojans to a single touchdown. That I
I touchdown, incidentally, was only j
, a "break," on a misplay by the
Pacific safety man.
Washington State, aided by a j
couple of down-south high school
products, whipped S.C. decisively
, the next week, 19-0, and the Tro- i
jan horse had started going hack- j
wards.
They traveled East, and Pittsburgh 1
j won, 20-6. Last week a tame Oregon
State eleven walked away with a 6-6
i tie, but S.C. fans consoled them
selves with the fact that Troy looked
1 good for the first seven minutes.
Cards Start Well
Stanford began training Septem-
I ber 15, ballyhooed to be the Coast's
| leading bet. San Jose State fell first
I victim to Tiny Thornhill's juniors,
'to a 48-0 tune. ,The second game
j ended in a 7-7 tie with Santa Clara.
;At Portland, Oregon State suc
-1 cumbed 17-0.
In an intersectional game with
Northwestern, the Cards again toyed
with the defense and made it 20-0.
i Last Saturday in a thrilling last
minute finish, Monk Moscrip's toe
| plunked up three points via the field
| goal route to win from U.S.F.
