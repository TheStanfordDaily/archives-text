# FAMINE BROKEN IN 1933 CLASH
## 
### 
When the final gun popped in the
shadow - shrouded Los Angeles
Olympic Stadium last year, ringing
down the cui'tain on Stanford's suc
cessful reduction of the supposedly
impregnable walls of Troy, a long
period of lean Stanford years in this
traditional rivalry was finally ended.
For not since 1926 had the Indians
been successful in turning back
Howard Jones' great U.S.C. aggre
gations. For seven years the Tro
jans had been the undoing of War
ner-coached Cardinal elevens.
A close 13 to 12 Stanford victory
in '26 preceded a long period of In
dian famine, with the following
j scores:
1927—U.5.C., 13; Stanford, 13.
1928—U.5.C., 13; Stanford 0.
1929—U.5.C., 7, Stanford, 0.
1930—U.5.C., 41, Stanford 12.
1931—U.5.C., 19; Stanford 0.
1932—U.5.C., 13, Stanford 0.
1933—Stanford, 13; U.S.C., 7.
