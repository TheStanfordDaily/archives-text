# SETS, ACTORS PREPARED FOR PERFORMANCE
## Geo. Andreini Supervises 'One Sunday Afternoon' Technical Details 
### 
One week from tonight, Novem
ber 2, is "One Sunday Afternoon."
All of which is dramatic, not con
tradictory. The play, initial Stanford
effort under the direction of William
Murray Timmons, enters its last
week of rcheax\sals well up to date.
Lines are almost letter - perfect.
Action is ready tor final polishing.
Sets, supervised by George Andreini,
approach completion.
Four scenes constitute this unusual
drama, from the pen of James Ha
gan. Their value, stresses Andreini,
lies not in the Max Reinhardt school
of spectaclism, but in providing the
proper background, establishing the
mood, for the unique plot.
Modern Set
The curtain rises for the prologue
—time, 1934—0n a small dentist's
office. It is plainly mediocre, and in
service for residence as well as pro
fessional quarters.
Act one flashes back to the Gay
Nineties, Avery's Park in Oakley.
This exterior, in which most of the
action of the play occurs, requires
the most elaborate scenic effects of
the production.
Scene Shifts
The scene shifts to a beer garden—
old-fashioned German—with tables,
lattice work, and gay holiday cos
tumes. Sound effects include a
merry-go-round and shooting gal
lery off-stage.
Biff Grimes' home in Oakley, three
years later, is again a drab interior,
plainly showing poverty. The great
est difficulty encountered in settings,
considers Andreini, will be in estab
lishing the homely charm of the play.
Mood depends to a great extent on
background, he explains.
Sets Almost Complete
After another return to Avery's
Park, The epilogue is again 1934, and
the dentist's office.
Painstaking attention to detail, in
order to recreate the delightful 1890
atmosphere, will be the major task of
scenery heads, who expect to an
nounce completion of sets before
time for dress rehearsal.
