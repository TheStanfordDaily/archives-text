# S.C. Possum Act Feared By Mentors
## Card Coaches Not Taking Moans Seriously 
### 
Wrinkling up their brows in a per
plexed and worried look, four mem
bers of Stanford's eoaching staff
expressed their opinions on tomor
row's little party with U.S.C.
Ilcad Coach Tiny Thornhill re
marked as follows: "I always look
for trouble with the Trojans, and
(his year they're tougher than
most people think. When we beat
them last year we had much more
to gain than to lose, but they had
everything to lose. This year the
shoe is on the other foot."
Backfield mentor Ernie Nevers,
talking between soaring punts which
he sent down the field, said: "Stan
ford has never beaten S.C. in our
Stadium. This game is a toss-up and
will be easier to talk about Saturday
night. Look for a fight to the finish.'"
Jim Lawson, Cardinal end coach,
was the most talkative of the quar
tet. This is his outlook: "No mat
ter what's said, the Trojans could
not he much weaker than the '33
S.C. team. They have too many
fine players, and they're getting
better in every game. If they play
the football they're capable of. no
outfit will trample them. Stanford
had better watch out."
Murray Cuddeback, head Indian
seout and coach of the grays: "1
1 watched U.S.C. against Pitt and Ore-
J gon State, and they played some
j classy ball at times. They're ready
! now to cut loose for a full game, and
j Stanford is the team they're gunning
I for. If the Trojans play as they did
[ in the first quarter of the O.S.C
game, Stanford is in for some tough
j sledding."
The College of the Pacific is much
perturbed over the rumor that Cali
j fornia wants Stagg as their coach.
