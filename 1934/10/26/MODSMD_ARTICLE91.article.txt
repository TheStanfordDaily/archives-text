## Dakan Only Regular Not Starting for Indian Babes; Southern First-Year Men Look Strong In Holding Bear Cubs to 14-6 Score 
### WARREN BREED 
in what promises to be a tight and well-played preliminary, the Stanford
frosh will defend their undefeated standing against the strong LI.S.C. frosh
tomorrow morning. The kick-off is scheduled for 11:15 o'clock.
Coach Bradshaw will send in his team of yearlings intact save the
injury to Bob Dakan, end. Dakan will he out for the rest of the season.

►Everyone else is in tip-top shape.
Work has been easy all week, so the
l'rosh will be supplied with an abun
dance of vitality.
While the Card frosh iiave gone
through a four-game schedule with
out defeat, Jeff Cravath's Trobabes
have won two and lost two. They
are fortified with several individual
3tar:j, but in the main nro aping their
varsity brothers by shows of "good
in spots" football. At times, espe
cially in the Santa Ana game, they
have shown sparks of winning play.
S.C. Holds Cal Babes
They looked strong against the
Cal frosh last Saturday, holding that
' Babe Vwonder team" to two touch
downs and tallying once on their
; own hook. Any team that can hold
j the U.C. '38 bunch to a 14-6 score
i is potential dynamite, and are ca
! pable of giving Stanford's frosh a
I tough forenoon tomorrow.
Bill Paulman, full, Ed Gillette,
! quarter, and Jimmy Coffis and Tom
Collins, halves, will start in the Card
backfield. In this lineup is a tre
' merulous amount of versatile offen
i sive drive. All four men are capable
j of running the flanks or plowing
through the line.
Paulman Good Kicker
Paulrnan's kicking is the best seen
by a freshman in these parts for
some time, his boots often sailing 60
| yards. He gets practically the same
I distance on his quick kicks. He also
j passes to Coffis and Collins and the
1 ends, Stone and Layer, and the re
ceiver in turn may lateral the ball
to somebody else. Such is the poten
tial threat of Bradshaw's first back
field.
' Reserve backs are Leo Madlem
and Doc Luckett, halves; Glenn
Hamilton, full, and Bill Roberts,
1 quarter. This quartet has seen action
in all the games, and possess some
tricks of their own.
Card Line Strong
In the line, Berneth Layer and
' Grant Stone are strong at ends.
• Two rangy tackles are Irv Henning
' son and Cy Oberg, and both know the
• art of line play thoroughly. At
1 i guard McKinney has beaten out
Partridge for the first string job,
pairing with Jay Holridge, stocky
1 and dependable running guard. Mil
lard Heath is dependable at centex\
Big threats of the U.S.C. frosh are
several flashy backs. Art Stranske,
of Santa Ana, plays a bang-up game
in every department at full, and
plows through the line for consider
able of the frosh yardage. Nick
Pappas, a Warburton-like runner, is
a scintillating performer at quarter,
though he may not start. Other
stars in the Trobabe backfield at
carrying the ball are Thompson,
Sloan, and Strayng.
Two ends, Bill Gaisford and Bill
Williams, are bulwarks on the line,
and places are already being reserved
on the varsity for them. Martin has
received considerable praise for his
work at center.
