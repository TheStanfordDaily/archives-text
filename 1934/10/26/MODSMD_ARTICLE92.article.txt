# Campus Leaders Predict Indian Victory Tomorrow
## OPTIMISM REIGNS ON FARM; SCRIBES NOT SO ONE-SIDED 
### Roger Kimball 
If a spirit of optimism which has
spread among prominent people on
the campus means anything, Stan
ford should defeat U.S.C. tomorrow
in the stadium. Most of the Farm
"big shots" picked Tiny Thornhill's
Cardinal eleven to win, expressing
little or no hesitation in doing so.
Several of the dozen who were
questioned added sidelights to their
opinions, however. Their answers to
the popular riddle of the day were
as follows:
Dean Mary Yost: "I know more
about Byrd's expedition than
about football, but if wishful
thinking is a valuable thing. Stan
ford should win."
George B. Culver, dean of men: l 'l
look for a very exciting and inter
esting game. U.S.C. will be at their
season's strongest point, but Stan
lord will be full of fire."
Dr. J. P. Mitchell, registrar: "The
Trojans will put up a good contest,
but Stanford will win."
Stanford Band Louder
Warren D. Allen, head of the mu
sic department: "It looks good all
light, as though Stanford should win.
The S.C. band looks bigger,* but the
Stanford band sounds bigger."
Pan-hel President
Margaret Taylor: "We shouldn't
be too confident, or the Trojans will
reverse the Stanford upset of last
year."
Frances Mosher, president of Roble
Club: "Since I saw S.C. play Whit
tier and Occidental, I have no doubts
of a Stanford victory."
Marion Storey, president (*f the
Women's Conference: "Ours is an
all-star team without having to
call in Hollywood. Astrologists
predict that Saturday will be a
Cardinal day."
Marvie Kahn, president of the
A.S.S.U.: "I expect Stanford to win,
but not by more than a field goal or
a touchdown at the most."
Rooting Important
Jimmy Triolo, head yell leader and
president of the senior class (by
Kahn): "It all depends on the rooting
section."
George Cobb, chairman of the In
terfraternity Board of Control: "We
beat them in '33 after the team and
most of the rooters had gone without
much sleep on the train. If we could
take them under those conditions, we
ought to do it again this year."
Harold Underbill, president of
Toyon Club: "Look out, because
Howard Jones and his boys are mas
ters of psychology, and are likely to
pull anything out of the bag."
Scribes Comment
Sports writers of the four main
daily San Francisco newspapers
say:
Bill Leiser, of the Chronicle: "It's
a usual Stanford-U.S.C. game. Stan
ford is confident of lowering the
boom; U.S.C. vows Stanford will be
licked if they don't win another
game. It's all wrong."
Harry Borba of the Examiner:
"The Trojans will give Stanford a
whale of a battle, and under certain
conditions they can whip the In
dians.''
Will Connolly of the News: "The
Stanfords have not been behind in
any game this season, but U.S.C.
might put the Indians over the hur
dle."
Pat Frayne of the Call-Bulletin:
"Beware, Stanford, the Trojans might
feel insulted oyer what the other
outfits have done to them, and take

it all out on Northern California.
Comparative scores are yesterday's
football junk."
