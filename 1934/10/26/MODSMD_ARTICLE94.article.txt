# CINDERMEN LOOK TO TOUGH 1935 SEASON
## 
### 
Stanford's 1935 track squad, fac
ing the mighty task of living up to
the 1934 reputationâ€”that of winning
the 1.C.4-A. and the N.C.A.A. cham
pionships, has been using the fall
track period for more than getting
into condition. The Friday afternoon
intersquad meets have meant severe
competition more often reserved for
March and April.
Norm Bright, one of the fastest
milers on the Coast but with all col
lege competition days over, has been
leading the distance runners through
six or eight laps or a cross country
run. Among the varsity' material
working out with Bright have been
Ed Wasem, senior, and Bill McCurdy,
Rusty March, and Bob Alexander,
sophomores.
In the middle distances Joe Burris
and Bill Sorensen, juniors, have been
training for another season of the
half-mile. A1 Blackman, 1.C.4-A.
440 champ for 1.934, is preparing for
his final year of college racing, which
will find him the peer of quarter
milers on the Coast, if not in the
country.
Weight men arc considerable in
number, but have yet to make a
name in varsity competition. Among
those now working on the shot and
discus are Jim Reynolds and Mel
Hurley, sophs; Hal King, Menlo J.C.
transfer; Hugh Gribbin and Gib
Holloway, juniors.
High jumpers Humbert Smith and
Lloyd Schween, both of whom have
cleared 6 feet 3 inches, will lead
the varsity in this department, judg
ing by,their performances during
the past few weeks!
A1 Cranston and Martin Baskin,
head the varsity sprinters.
In a game against Michigan, "Red"
Grange made four touchdowns in
12 minutes.
