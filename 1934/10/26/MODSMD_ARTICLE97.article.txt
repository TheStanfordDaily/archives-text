How to learn a stroke and almost
make a record in the space of an
ordinary class period was demon
strated by Cynthia Coonley, fresh
man and member of the women's
advanced swimming section.
When time was taken for the 25-
yard back crawl, about which Coon
ley had sought instruction at the
beginning of the hour, it was found
that her time was 18.5 seconds,
which is three-tenths of a second
slower than the record for the pool.
Kitty Ahrens finished second, in
20.5 seconds. Close behind came
Sally Parker and Frederica Vitousek
in 21 seconds, followed by Miriam
Ward one-half of a second latex*.
In the 25-yard free-style, Ahrens
came in first as was expected, making
it in 14 seconds, which was only two
seconds ahead of Coonley, Parker,
Vitousek, and Ruth French. Ahrens'
time was four-fifths of a second
slower than the record.
Coonley and Vitousek also led in
the breast stroke, finishing in 23 sec
onds, with Peggy Geiss and Miriam
Ward doing it in 24.5 seconds. The
record is 18.8 seconds.
