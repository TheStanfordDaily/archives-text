# FIERY DEBATE ON STATE RACE SET FOR FARM
## Rowell, Bartlett To Speak For Merriam, Sinclair At Wednesday Rally SLATED FOR PAVILION Admission Cards Available In Ad Building 
### Cedric Larson 
Political fur will fly Wednesday
night at 7:30 in the basketball pa
vilion when Chester Rowell, Chron
icle editor and de luxe orator, de
bates with a former Berkeley mayor,
Louis Bartlett, the question: "Should
binclair or Mm nam Be Governor of
California?"
Rowell Sinclair's Foe
Rowell, who upholds the Repub
lican banner, is well known to Stan
ford students as lecturer in political
science. Rowell, as editor of one of
the most influential newspapers in
Northern California, has championed
the Merriam ticket in cartoon and
editorial for many weeks. He is
undoubtedly the strongest Merriam
exponent in the Bay region.
"Backed into a corner," states Edi
tor Rowell, "Sinclair hurls epithets
at his foes. All the newspaper re
porters are 'hired liars' and their
employers are 'capitalists,' which is
worse. He is disillusioned to the
point of hysteria."
Sinclair at Stanford
Stanford's interest is running high
in this gubernatorial contest. This is
due perhaps to the fact that student
elements of every rubric hue have
been gathered under the Sinclair
standard ever since December 13,
1933, when the Socialist writer vis
ited Stanford in persdh, and en
thusiastically outlined his famous
plan in the packed Assembly Hall.
Rowell sees one of the greatest
threats to Sinclair's election the
fact that "every daily newspaper in
California is against Sinclair. Nearly
.ill of them are specifically for Mer
riam, and only two of any signifi
cance, though insulated from reality,
arc actively for Haight, on the' illu
sion that he is a contender."
"Sinclair sees in his mind's eye
idyllic farm colonies in California,
settled on land which does not exist,
prospering by exchanging things
which they can not grow with work
ers for things which their factories
can not produce," stated the Chron
icle editor.
Bartlett Scores Merriam
Louis Bartlett, as Democratic
mouthpiece, will endeavor to pull
rabbits from the EPIC hat before an
audience which, according to the
Stanford Daily poll of last week, is
5 to 1 skeptical of the efficacy of the
Sinclair magic.
Bartlett is a San Francisco attor
ney, and held the mayorship of Ber
keley for two terms, 1919-23. He is
well known in Northern California
Democratic circles. He is also a
past president of the League of Cali
fornia Municipalities, a nonpartisan
civic organization claiming member
ship of 203 of California's 280 cities.
Sinclair, Bartlett believes, if ele
vated to the gubernatorial office,
can make a success of his EPIC (end
poverty in California) plan. He will
demonstrate the reaspns he holds for
believing in the feasibility of the
Socialist author's projects.
Admission by Ticket
Admission, though free, is by ticket
only. They may be obtained by stu
dents and faculty at the office of the
Committee on Public Exercises in
room 173 of the Administration
Building, and by the public at
Keeble's in Palo Alto.
At 7:15 Wednesday evening, the
Pavilion will be thrown open to per
sons who have not been able to se
cure tickets.

Sinclair, Bartlett believes, if ele
vated to the gubernatorial office,
can make a success of his EPIC (end

demonstrate the reaspns he holds for
believing in the feasibility of the

Admission by Ticket

At 7:15 Wednesday evening, the

Political fur will fly Wednesday
night at 7:30 in the basketball pa
vilion when Chester Rowell, Chron
icle editor and de luxe orator, de
bates with a former Berkeley mayor,
Louis Bartlett, the question: "Should
binclair or Mm nam Be Governor of
California?"
Rowell Sinclair's Foe
Rowell, who upholds the Repub
lican banner, is well known to Stan
ford students as lecturer in political
science. Rowell, as editor of one of
the most influential newspapers in
Northern California, has championed
the Merriam ticket in cartoon and
editorial for many weeks. He is
undoubtedly the strongest Merriam
exponent in the Bay region.
"Backed into a corner," states Edi
tor Rowell, "Sinclair hurls epithets
at his foes. All the newspaper re
porters are 'hired liars' and their
employers are 'capitalists,' which is
worse. He is disillusioned to the
point of hysteria."
Sinclair at Stanford
Stanford's interest is running high
in this gubernatorial contest. This is
due perhaps to the fact that student
elements of every rubric hue have
been gathered under the Sinclair
standard ever since December 13,
1933, when the Socialist writer vis
ited Stanford in persdh, and en
thusiastically outlined his famous
plan in the packed Assembly Hall.
Rowell sees one of the greatest
threats to Sinclair's election the
fact that "every daily newspaper in
California is against Sinclair. Nearly
.ill of them are specifically for Mer
riam, and only two of any signifi
cance, though insulated from reality,
arc actively for Haight, on the' illu
sion that he is a contender."
"Sinclair sees in his mind's eye
idyllic farm colonies in California,
settled on land which does not exist,
prospering by exchanging things
which they can not grow with work
ers for things which their factories
can not produce," stated the Chron
icle editor.
Bartlett Scores Merriam
Louis Bartlett, as Democratic
mouthpiece, will endeavor to pull
rabbits from the EPIC hat before an
audience which, according to the
Stanford Daily poll of last week, is
5 to 1 skeptical of the efficacy of the
Sinclair magic.
Bartlett is a San Francisco attor
ney, and held the mayorship of Ber
keley for two terms, 1919-23. He is
well known in Northern California
Democratic circles. He is also a
past president of the League of Cali
fornia Municipalities, a nonpartisan
civic organization claiming member
ship of 203 of California's 280 cities.
