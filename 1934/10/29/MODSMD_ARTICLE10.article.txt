# A.F.L. Head Scores Gain In Jobless
## Asks Industry To Aid In Increasing Jobs 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 22 (/P).— I The
American Federation of Labor today
asserted that more men were jobless
than a year ago, and challenged in
dustry to co-operate in a "general
program" to increase employment.
A statement by William Green,
president of the A. F. of L., set forth
top, that although the federal gov
ernment's monthly'relief payment for
2,229,000 persons was $395,000,000,
that expenditure was "not creating
income to pay their cost."
Milk Government
"They are a steady drain on fed
eral resources," he said.
Then he made this challenge- to
industry:
"Could not the administration in
vite all industries to co-operate in
a general program to increase pi*o
duction and put men to work?
"If the nation-wide level of all
production were lifted 30 per cent in
a balanced program, adjusting pro
duction to consumption needs, each
industry would then be assured that
all other industries would increase
their production, and the wealth pro
duced by putting „ labor to work
would create income to buy the
product of all."
First Time Since '33
"For the first time since the Presi
dent's re-employment program
started in July, 1933, unemployment
has exceeded last year's level.
"The total number at work in the
United States was 39,764,000 in Sep
tember 1933; by September 1934, it
had declined to 39,367,000. During
these twelve months the normal in
crease in population had added close
to 450,000 to the army of job seekers
for whom industry provides no work.
Thus the number without work in
industry has risen from 10,108,000 in
September 1933, to 10,951,000 in Sep
tember 1934."
To lie Hard Winter
His statement held that September
created only 154,000 new jobs and
these would be lost again with the
approach of the winter season.
"It is significant," Green said, "that
the largest employment gam in Sep
tember was in the industry directly
affected by farmers' and workers'
buying power—retail trade. This
buying power which had been accu
mulated over recent months became
effective in the September sales, in
creasing the volume of trade and
creating new jobs."
He estimated that 17,000,000 per
sons, members of 4,334,000 families,
were on relief rolls in July.
