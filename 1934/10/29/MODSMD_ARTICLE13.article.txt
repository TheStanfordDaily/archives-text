# Rose Bowl Choices Narrowed to Cards, Washington in West
## Stanford Licks U.S.C. 16-0; Huskies Down Bears By 13-7 Margin 
### Millard Browne 
Rose Bowl dreaming was vir
tually narrowed down to two Pacific
j Coast schools Saturday.
And this fact made California's
Golden Bears and the poor old Tro
jan horse wake up with a nasty Sun
: day morning taste.
To summarize: Stanford 16, U.S.C.
0; Washington 13, California 7.
Rose Bowl dreaming is narrowed
; down to Stanford and Washington,
i But that can be talked about, and
will be constantly for the next two
months.
Jinx Broken
j The Huskies beat California, and
| the "Hate Ingram Club" on the Cali
i fornia campus pledged another large
; class. But we'll leave comment on
! that to the Daily Californian.
i The important thing to Stanford is
; that the Cardinals, as a team, not a
group of individuals, beat into com
plete submission a U.S.C. Trojan
! football eleven that had never lost a
! game on Northern California soil
since under direction of Howard
! Jones.
Trojans Smothered
The score-board read 16 tp 0 in
j Stanford's favor as the teams left
the field. But that tells only part of
| the stoi-y.
It does not show how the Trojans
| were completely smothered on
j nearly every play. And it does not
i give indication of the helplessness of
' U.S.C. when Stanford unleashed her
J second-quarter 64-yard drive to a
I score.
The "Thundering Herd" thundered
I to a mere two first downs through
j the line and one more through the
I air. This same Herd reached the
I Stanford 44-yard line once, late in
i the fourth quarter, and did not cross
j its own 40-yard stripe in possession
I of the ball at any other time during
j the game.
Grayson Repeats
I Last year when Stanford beat
Southern California it was a case of
Bobby Gi'ayson functioning behind
an inspired line. This year was a
t repetition, except that the Stanford
1 line was not so inspired, but more
I cool, calculating, smoothly-clicking,
I and confident.
Yes, it was Grayson day again, for
| the first time since early in the sea
| son. The Portland boomer took his
! turn, just as Frankie Alustiza did last
! week, and Bones Hamilton the week
' before, in furnishing the spark for
! the Indian scores.
Moscrip Adds Four
Stanford scored a touchdown in
! the sccond period, a field goal at the
i close of the third quarter, and an-
I other touchdown in the fourth. Gray
j .son and Monk Moscrip made all of
j the points, the former accounting for
both touchdowns, and the latter be
ing responsible for the field goal and
1 one conversion.
It was not until toward the end of
the second quarter that the Redskins
took it upon themselves to break
into the scoring column. They
started on their own 36-yard line.
On fourth down and a yard to go,
I hey received the better of a five
yard penalty which advanced them
to midfield, and from there on the
' going was comparatively easy.
Grayson Goes Over
Grayson slashed through for six,
then added eight more. Alustiza,
Hamilton, Grayson, and again Ham
ilton contributed the third consecu
tive first down of that irrepressible
drive to put the ball on the Trojan
24-yat'd line.
Another straight power play with
Grayson doing the ball-carrying was
good for seven, and Hamilton
plunged to the 13 for a first down.
Two more plays served notice of
j Grayson's contempt for the immov
, able Troy line, and the Indians had
I possession on the three-yard line
I with four tries left. It required but
two, both featuring Grayson.
Kick Blocked
Moscrip added the point to make
, the half - time score Stanford 7,
Troy 0, with less than two minutes'
of play remaining.
Three kicks were entirely re
sponsible for Stanford's second score.
The three kicks were included in
the last six plays of the third period.
; Alustiza punted out of bounds on the
one-yard line. Inky Wotkyns' return
punt was partially blocked and rolled
out on the Trojan 14. Three Cardinal
plays gained but three yards, and
Moscrip place kicked a field goal
squarely between the uprights to
make the count 10 to 0.
Reisncr Intercepts
i Troy's nearest thing to a threat was
climaxed by paving the way for the
third Stanford goal crossing. A 20-
yard pass gave S.C. the ball on
Stanford's 44-yard line. Then Cot
ton Warburton, Southern California's
all-American quarterback, passed
again. This was intercepted by
Johnny Reisner on his 36, and the
speedy Cardinal halfback spurted
back to the U.S.C. 21 before he was
brought down.
Once again Grayson came into the
picture. Reisner gained one, then
the uncontrollable fullback made two
snappy runs to a first down on the
nine-yard ribbon. Alustiza gained
five, and Grayson dived over the goal
line through center. Reisner's try for
point went wide.
S.C. Does Fumbling
Stanford scored 19 first downs dur
ing the game and netted 242 yards
from ground and air. The Trojans
were held to a net gain of 89 yards.
The Indians completed five out of 15
passes, and Troy's eight aerial at
tempts connected but once. Stanford
intercepted two S.C. passes.
The old story of Cardinal fum
bling on U.S.C.'s goal line was re
versed, and Troy did all the fumbling
during the day. Howard Jones' men
hobbled the oval twice, with Stan
ford recovering one of these.
