# Cossacks' Song Tradition Dates From Middle Ages

"Give the Don your faith and honor 1
As your father did of old.
God protects the Cossack hero,
Stalwart, hardy, fearless, bold."
For centuries the Cossack mother
sang this lullaby to her children and
told them tales of the famous Rus
sian Robin Hood, Stenka Rasin, the
wild Cossack hero of Ihe Volga basin
who plundered the rich to distribute
his booty to the poor.
Russian folk-lore abounds with
stories of the daring of these hard
riding horsemen of the Steppes,
whose very name, taken from, the
Turkish word "kasak," meaning pil
laging warrior. In early times the
Turk and Tartar fled before them,
and when, under the firm hand of
Peter the Great, they organized as a
military unit, they continued to be
the terror of Russia's foes.
The late Czar drew his bodyguard
from the ranks of the Cossacks,
calling them "Kubantsui" as they
hailed from the territory of the Ku
ban. The Don Cossacks, who appear
tomorrow night at the Pavilion under
the auspices of the Concert Series,
drew their name from the Don basin,
and were also members of the Im
perial regiment.
New York Incident
An interesting anecdote is con
nected with this fact. Recently a
banquet was given in New York in
honor of the Don Cossack Russian
Male Chorus, and the niece and
nephew of the Czar, Grand Duchess
Marie and Grand Duke Dmitri, were
guests of honor.
As the guosl.s were filing past the
distinguished couple to greet them,
a cry of frenzied excitement was

suddenly heard. Turning toward the
Grand Duchess Marie, all eyes per
ceived her looking down at two
kneeling figures in front of her, two
Don Cossacks who wept as they
kissed her skirts. She commanded
them to rise, and throwing her arms
around each in turn, she kissed their
cheeks.
It appeared that for many years
these two Cossacks had been officers
in the Imperial regiment and had
often been assigned to the Grand
Duchess as bodyguards. Not since
the days of the revolution had they
seen their former princess, who'is to
day potential head of all Russia.
Riga Experience
Many other unusual experiences
have happened to these soldier
singers, and especially to their
diminutive conductor, Serge Jaroff.
Jaroff, in order to devote all his time
to train his chorus, and because his
social obligations might be many,
has never learned to speak any lan
guage save his native Russian. At
one time this lack nearly resulted in
a catastrophp.
During an intermission at a con
cert in Riga, an agitator jumped on
the stage and began a long speech in
his native tongue. He called atten
tion to the fact that the Don Cos
sacks were Russians, members of a
nation that had oppressed the citi
zens of Riga for many years. The
audience rose and cheered, and
Jaroff, in the wings, thought the
applause was for his chorus. Com
ing onto the stage, he bowed re
peatedly, as the agitator pointed an
accusing finger in his direction. The
police arrived in time to prevent a
riot.

Turkish word "kasak," meaning pil
laging warrior. In early times the
Turk and Tartar fled before them,
and when, under the firm hand of
Peter the Great, they organized as a
military unit, they continued to be
the terror of Russia's foes.
The late Czar drew his bodyguard
from the ranks of the Cossacks,
calling them "Kubantsui" as they
hailed from the territory of the Ku
ban. The Don Cossacks, who appear
tomorrow night at the Pavilion under
the auspices of the Concert Series,
drew their name from the Don basin,
and were also members of the Im
perial regiment.
New York Incident
An interesting anecdote is con
nected with this fact. Recently a
banquet was given in New York in
honor of the Don Cossack Russian
Male Chorus, and the niece and
nephew of the Czar, Grand Duchess
Marie and Grand Duke Dmitri, were
guests of honor.
As the guosl.s were filing past the
distinguished couple to greet them,
a cry of frenzied excitement was

suddenly heard. Turning toward the
Grand Duchess Marie, all eyes per
ceived her looking down at two
kneeling figures in front of her, two
Don Cossacks who wept as they
kissed her skirts. She commanded
them to rise, and throwing her arms
around each in turn, she kissed their
cheeks.
It appeared that for many years
these two Cossacks had been officers
in the Imperial regiment and had
often been assigned to the Grand
Duchess as bodyguards. Not since
the days of the revolution had they
seen their former princess, who'is to
day potential head of all Russia.
Riga Experience
Many other unusual experiences
have happened to these soldier
singers, and especially to their
diminutive conductor, Serge Jaroff.
Jaroff, in order to devote all his time
to train his chorus, and because his
social obligations might be many,
has never learned to speak any lan
guage save his native Russian. At
one time this lack nearly resulted in
a catastrophp.
During an intermission at a con
cert in Riga, an agitator jumped on
the stage and began a long speech in
his native tongue. He called atten
tion to the fact that the Don Cos
sacks were Russians, members of a
nation that had oppressed the citi
zens of Riga for many years. The
audience rose and cheered, and
Jaroff, in the wings, thought the
applause was for his chorus. Com
ing onto the stage, he bowed re
peatedly, as the agitator pointed an
accusing finger in his direction. The
police arrived in time to prevent a
riot.
"Give the Don your faith and honor 1
As your father did of old.
God protects the Cossack hero,
Stalwart, hardy, fearless, bold."
For centuries the Cossack mother
sang this lullaby to her children and
told them tales of the famous Rus
sian Robin Hood, Stenka Rasin, the
wild Cossack hero of Ihe Volga basin
who plundered the rich to distribute
his booty to the poor.
Russian folk-lore abounds with
stories of the daring of these hard
riding horsemen of the Steppes,
whose very name, taken from, the
Turkish word "kasak," meaning pil
laging warrior. In early times the
Turk and Tartar fled before them,
and when, under the firm hand of
Peter the Great, they organized as a
military unit, they continued to be
