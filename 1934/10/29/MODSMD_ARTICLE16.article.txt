SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 28 (/»»>•
Cryptic messages which flashed out
from the roaring plane of Sir Charles
Kingsford-Smith told of his progress
tonight as he sped from Suva to
Honolulu on a three-stage flight
from Australia to California.
As the hours passed and the plane
skimmed over tropic waters, re
assuring word came from the famed
Australian aviator and his navigator,
Captain P. G. Taylor.
He told of a storm they sighted
ahead, of their feeling of boredom at
the long flight ahead with inter
spersing messages that all was "0.K."
''Just passed Home Islands 10
minutes ago," said a message re
ceived by the Navy radio here
shortly after the take-off. "We are
a bit bored to think of the long day
and night ahead.
"Wo have throttled well back to
guard consumption and so as to ar
rive at Wheeler Field (Honolulu)
after daylight."
Then came news of the storm
ahead and a possible threat to their
safety.
"Running into storm so climbing
to try and pass over," crackled the
ship's wireless.
"Now below heavy rainclouds at
500 feet. All 0.K.," was the reassur
ing flash a few minutes later.
Several hours after the take-off
this message came: "Now at 2500
feet with 10 miles visibility. Very
warm. Distance run 950 statute
miles."
At McGill University, Toronto,
Canada, "jazz tea dances" have been
planned for the year, to which men
and women may come unescorted.
