SAN FKANCJSCO, Oct. 28 (/P).â€”
Rioting between asserted Commun
ists and police in Jefferson Square
here today sent two officers to the
hospital and resulted in the arrest of
one woman and seven men.
Disturbances have occurred each
Sunday, officers said, and they went
to the square and ordered orators to
move on as they were violating a
park ordinance.
Officers described the disturbance
as the most severe since the alleged
Communists were ousted from their
headquarters in raids by self-styled
"vigilantes" and police after the re
cent general strike.
Four of those arrested, including
the woman, gave their address as
37 Grove Street, headquarters of
the "Western Worker," Communist
publication.
