Picture on Display
A poster with photographs of lead
ing members of the cast, in full re
galia as they will appear in the play,
has been posted on the English Cor
ner bulletin board, and attracts much
comment. This display supplements
advertising cards which were placed
in strategic points about the campus
two weeks ago, in one of the most
pretentious publicity drives of ac
cent years.
Loud-speaker announcements dur

to attract a crowd to the play, initial
production under the direction of
William Murray Timmons.
Mail orders have been filled during
the last week. According to Dick
Frank, dramatic manager, they have
set a new high record. If campus
seat sale is as large, he predicts, the
Assembly Hall may be entirely sold
out, a rare occurrence on the Stan
ford campus.
