# Horse Senseâ€” Will We Repeat?
## 
### 
While your eyes bear witness to the fact
which gloating headlines in Northern Cali
fornia newspapers are still repeating, that
Stanford defeated U.S.C. in lootball, lor the
second consecutive time, and for the first
time in home territory, those Terrible Trojans
from Southern California have nothing of
which to be ashamed.
For years, Troy has been in the very un
desirable position of being far too good for
any ordinary man's team to meet on even
terms. Smart alecs went as far as to suggest
a system of competitive handicaps a la game
called golf. And players kept thronging to
Troy, hoping to find a berth on that unbeatable
varsity.
Obviously, the Myth of the Trojan Horse
could not continue indefinitely. So many ath
leles, all of them good, could not possibly play
oil the same squad. Other institutions, vig
orously scheming to "trounce Troy," entered
into a solemn and mutual compact of whole
sale butchery in the field of contact for high
school and junior college sensations. Maybe
not a verified compact, but certain nothing
less than butchery. You cut my throat, and
just watch me cut yours. . . .
Southern California finally reached the
point where it couldn't stand the gaff. Public
sentiment in general crystalized very defi
nitely with an unfavorable attitude toward
the powerful Trojans, not because of what
they did, but because of what people heard
other people had heard. Alumni, bragging
about the overwhelming supply of good mate
rial, began actually to believe that the need
for organized efforts in bringing prep stars
to the southern school was no more. They
were wrong.
Every football team in the country is di
rectly dependent upon alumni support in
bringing new men to its own particular col
lege. It is the alumnus who lips and shouts
that the old place may not be the same as it
used to was, but it certainly must have a
good football team, and he is going to do his
best to help. When alumni begin to lose this
feeling, no matter the reason, the King is
going to topple.
Yes, the Trojans still have a good football
team. They played a good brand of football
last Saturday. But Stanford was just too good
for Southern California this year. Stanford
too has a good football team, acknowledged
one of the best.
But will Stanford follow Trov?
