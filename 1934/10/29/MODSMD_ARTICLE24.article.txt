# "Justice" â€”in California

### 
When 011 May 30, 1933, David Lamson was
taken to the Santa Clara county jail on a
charge of having murdered his wife, few then
;it Stanford would have thought that 17
months later his fate would still he unde
cided, still the subject of screaming newspaper
headlines and editorial comment.
For hundreds of years men have suffered
hv and protested at the law's delay, hut in
effectively and without result. Succeeding
centuries have only intensified the legal di
lemma. Justice is not only blind but very,
very lame and halting in achieving its ends.
Not all the responsibility for the Lamson
delay can be laid at the doors of our legal
system. Overcrowded dockets and cumber
some procedure are probably responsible for
the slowness of the Supreme Court's action.
Hut since the decision was handed down there
has been no excuse for the existent doubt and
indecision that surrounds the fate of David
Lamson.
There is a feeling on the part of many that
his case has been made a political football by
county officials. Whether true or not, the
charge can best be answered by an immediate
decision on the part of Santa Clara County
as to whether it intends to drop the charges
or to call a new trial.
Many believe that the evidence does not and
never has justified the charge of murder. The
Supreme Court of the State of California
admits that the evidence did not justify the
guilty verdict. II additional evidence has been
gathered, a new trial should he called. If there
is no new evidence, the alternative is plain and
the whole case should be dropped.
Meanwhile the charge of murder, the se
verest indictment that society can make,
hangs over the head of David Lamson. The
question of his guilt has been debated long
enough. A linal and immediate decision is
awaited by the public.
