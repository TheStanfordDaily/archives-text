"The Second World \V;ir. A World War
Within Nine Months is the startling predic
tion of Johannes Steel, journalist, economist
and famous authority of world affairs, the
man who h:is predicted four major European
crises,"
Thus sereams the San Francisco C.hronirlr
in :i hlarl<-rnled, top hox on its second page,
announcing ;i series of articles. Steel is per
haps ;i competent authority and probably
Knows far more about the European situation

than the man in the street.
But even the proverbial man in the street
knows that Europe is a powder mill, the hot
spot of international relations, the place where
crucial things are likely to happen sooner and
more violently than in any other part of the
globe. There might he a war next week or
next year hut to say that there will he a
war within a specified length of time is some
thing no one, not even a man of Steel's claims
to fame, should attempt.
For several years now authorities have been
predicting wai* within some such time as three
weeks, three months, or three years. Anyone
can say that there will he a war if some certain
thing happens hut without that causative
event, which no one can foresee, the predicted
war does not take place.
Certainly, Chronicle, there'll he a war some
time. The Daily would appreciate a little hit
of "inside information" just ahou't twelve
hours early. Then we could run pictures and
everything.
