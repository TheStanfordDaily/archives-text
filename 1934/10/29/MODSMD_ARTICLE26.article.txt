# Stanford's Loud Speaker
## 
### 
There is a public address system on the
Stanford camfuis. It was bought and paid for
by the Associated Students, and since it cost
a sum of $700, it is used as often as possible,
so that the apparatus will not he a total loss
to the campus.
Last Saturday afternoon there was a game
on the Farm, in the Stanford stadium. It was
quite a football game. The Indians defeated
the Trojans. At this game, Stanford's elabo
rate public address system was used.
It is quite an elaborate affair. It is white,
and gleaming porcelain. It looks like a frigid
aire. It has many impressive buttons, and its
gleaming sides make it look like some new
invention of modern science. Like a rickshaw,
it has poles to support it. When it is installed,
its devoted attendant tenderly slips the poles
out and gingerly lifts it to the ground.
Musicians on the campus, when asked the
merits of the sound box, claimed that it was
faulty. The engineering constructors decided
that it needed a new microphone, and planned
to install one.
At the S.C. rally last Wednesday night,
the P.A. system of an oil company was used.
The change was tremendous. All the people
in the pavilion could actually hear what was
being said.
At the S.C. game the A.S.S.U. system was
used. Veil King Triolo attempted to speak
through the megaphone all afternoon. At
times he could be understood. At others, it
sounded as if he were trying to whisper sweet
nothings to his rooting section. During half
time card stunts, people in the last rows
turned up the wrong cards, because they could
not hear the instructions.
The climax came in the A.S.S.U. dance after
the S.C. game Saturday night. Once in a while
the orchestra could almost be heard. At other
times, it seemed as if the broadcast were
coming from another continent.
As a result of the home-made product, the
Associated Students collectively are out the
price of a good public address system. Gallics
and dances will suffer from lack of adequate
broadcast facilities. The yell leader will go
to bed after every game, and attempt to re
gain a voice he has lost trying to make his
rooting section hear him. Dance orchestras
will curse amplification that makes them
sound like light opera harmony on Monday
morning.
So Stanford has a public address system.
So what? ,
