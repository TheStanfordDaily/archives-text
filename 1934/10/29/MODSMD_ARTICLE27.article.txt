## THE 						STORY OF THE ELEPHANT AND THE DONKEY 
### CROMPTON BANGS, Jr 
Boston, Mass., Oct. 23.—Once upon a time, as we
learned in Cit., Am. Hist., etc., there were two parties,
the Democrats and the Republicans. Some people tried
to teach us they stood for something. Well, they may
have, but that was long ago.
For some time they have been convenient machines
for getting elected to office, which were very often put
in moth balls after reaching Washington. For example,
Messrs. Borah, Norris, etc., look at and speak to their
fellow Republicans only when they need their help
in getting re-elected.
Naturally there are no such things as party prin
ciples; these exist only before election day. F.R. got
elected in 1932 by promising to support the platform;
he really promised nothing at all, so he took the
country by surprise. Here is where the story begins.
After F.R. had been in office a year and a half,
his policies had alienated many prominent Democrats,
while winning him a few Republicans. In almost
every case the dividing line between pro and anti-
Roosevelt is the same as that between Liberal and
Conservative—if these terms mean anything. At least
they mean more than Republican and Democrat.
Now it is almost two years since F.R. was elected.
In the first Congressional election since 1932, the one
and only issue is support of the President. The Demo
cratic party has the strongest hold on the voters any
party has ever had, yet it is more divided than it ever
was. The only thing all Democrats can agree on is
support of Mr. Roosevelt.
So the question this fall is not how many Democrats
and how many Republicans will be elected, but what
kind of Democrats and what kind of Republicans they
will be. Most of them will go pro-Roosevelt. That's
certain.
Unfortunately most of them will be the spending
kind, which is dangerous, but not surprising if you
know the way they have campaigned. Here in New
England, candidates are promising so much relief, so
many public works, so many jobs if elected. If they
are already in office, they have figures to prove how
much the U.S. has spent in their district. If they are
elected, they will have to keep on spending to be re
elected. F.R. is the only one who can stop them, and
unless business gets a lot better, even the President
will have a hard time keeping Congress from pawning
the capitol and the Washington Monument.
While this may be unfortunate, the; New Deal has
placed American politics—for the time being at least—
on a left and right, pro and anti-Roosevelt, basis. This is
all to the good, while the spending may be all to the
bad. At least we can feel good about the first, and
wait until the time comes before we worry about the
U.S. going to the dogs.

certain.
Unfortunately most of them will be the spending
kind, which is dangerous, but not surprising if you
know the way they have campaigned. Here in New
England, candidates are promising so much relief, so
many public works, so many jobs if elected. If they
are already in office, they have figures to prove how
much the U.S. has spent in their district. If they are
elected, they will have to keep on spending to be re
elected. F.R. is the only one who can stop them, and
unless business gets a lot better, even the President
will have a hard time keeping Congress from pawning
the capitol and the Washington Monument.
While this may be unfortunate, the; New Deal has
placed American politics—for the time being at least—
on a left and right, pro and anti-Roosevelt, basis. This is
all to the good, while the spending may be all to the
bad. At least we can feel good about the first, and
wait until the time comes before we worry about the
U.S. going to the dogs.
Boston, Mass., Oct. 23.—Once upon a time, as we
learned in Cit., Am. Hist., etc., there were two parties,
the Democrats and the Republicans. Some people tried
to teach us they stood for something. Well, they may
have, but that was long ago.
For some time they have been convenient machines
for getting elected to office, which were very often put
in moth balls after reaching Washington. For example,
Messrs. Borah, Norris, etc., look at and speak to their
fellow Republicans only when they need their help
in getting re-elected.
Naturally there are no such things as party prin
ciples; these exist only before election day. F.R. got
elected in 1932 by promising to support the platform;
he really promised nothing at all, so he took the
country by surprise. Here is where the story begins.
After F.R. had been in office a year and a half,
his policies had alienated many prominent Democrats,
while winning him a few Republicans. In almost
every case the dividing line between pro and anti-
Roosevelt is the same as that between Liberal and
Conservative—if these terms mean anything. At least
they mean more than Republican and Democrat.
Now it is almost two years since F.R. was elected.
In the first Congressional election since 1932, the one
and only issue is support of the President. The Demo
cratic party has the strongest hold on the voters any
party has ever had, yet it is more divided than it ever
was. The only thing all Democrats can agree on is
support of Mr. Roosevelt.
So the question this fall is not how many Democrats
and how many Republicans will be elected, but what
kind of Democrats and what kind of Republicans they
will be. Most of them will go pro-Roosevelt. That's
certain.
Unfortunately most of them will be the spending
kind, which is dangerous, but not surprising if you
know the way they have campaigned. Here in New
England, candidates are promising so much relief, so
many public works, so many jobs if elected. If they

much the U.S. has spent in their district. If they are
