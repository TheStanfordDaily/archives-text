# BULL SESSION
## I. DICTATOR OF STANFORD, AND HOW 
### 
When I became Dictator of Stan- »
ford, the life of the Farm( at least,
in Autumn Quarter) centered around
a giant Stadium, which King Foot
ball had erected, and which King
Football paid for and controlled. I
had no wish (for the moment at
least) to alter the chosen paths of
happiness of thousands of Stanford i
students. I decided that the best l
thing I could do—to consolidate my |
position as Dictator—was to make it j
easier for these students to enjoy ;
their favorite recreation.
I proposed to make some changes j
in the athletic set-up. People said
it was impossible, for the lords of
athletics were strongly entrenched.!
My answer was: "Egad, EBAS will
do it!" EBAS, of course, was the j
contracted name I had given to my |
campaign slogan: End Bureaucracy
At Stanford. I had picked on "Bu
reaucracy" to end, because "Bu
reaucracy" was popularly disliked in
a number of the departments of the
University, and because the "Board
of Athletic Control" was obviously
too long to fit into a snappy slogan.
People still doubted that the thing
could go through, but they had for
gotten that a Dictator was at work,
and not just a pack of students—
howling in their misery, but power
less to do anything.
My first action was to incx'ease the
student membership on the 8.A.C., j
so that student athletics would be
represented by students. I pointed
out that as at present constituted,,

student representation on the B.A.C.
was a puny one-third, which was j
helpless to do anything against the
overwhelming votes and glances of
the six Alumni and Faculty mem
bers.
Then EBAS turned to the relief
of financially distressed, but foot- |
ball-conscious students. First, tick
ets to second-rate games were sold i
at dractically reduced prices be
cause it was just, and because the
Stadium was not being filled at the !
high prices.

Then attention was turned to the
gravy in Stanford's big bowl: the
hundreds of ushering and police jobs
there available. It was called to the
notice of the students' B.A.C. that!
at present many of these jobs went
to outsiders, who were as out of ■
place in the Stadium as a colored
kleagle in the Ku Klux Klan. There >
were numerous Stanford students
who wanted these jobs, but so little :
publicity was given to the offers of |
employment that many did not know ;
when stadium work was available.
The novelty of giving Stanford;
work to Stanford students startled
not a few, none more than the local
high-school coaches and their men,
who had always managed to worm
in on Stanford's gravy train. EBAS
was slowly making sporting condi
tions more equitable. There were
some who suggested that EBAS
should have a look at the Book
store.
