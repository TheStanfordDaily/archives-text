"BIG HEARTED HERBERT"
At the Varsity Theatre
An intelligent and versatile per- ;
formance by Aline MacMahon makes 1
this rather dull picture sittable.
Aline is the harassed but under
standing wife of a perennial grouch, I

"big - hearted ]
Herbert," played;
convincingly by!
Guy Kibbee.'
Having worked I
up from the bot- ;
torn, he vocifer- |
ously and con- J
tinuously ex-

presses his disdain for colleges, so
ciety, and simple luxuries. But, after j
a really humorous climax, in which
his wife takes his "plain-folks" ur- j
gument literally, Herbie quickly I
tacks back to the normal life of a :
well-to-do American babbitt.
