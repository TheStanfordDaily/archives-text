# "THE MIKADO"
## 
### 
At the Curran Theatre
The charm of Gilbert and Sulli
van once again graced the San Fran
cisco stage when "The Mikado"
opened last night at the Curran
Theatre. Coming direct from a great
four-week success in Los Angeles,
where they reopened the famous and
newly - modernized Philharmonic
Auditorium, the Lyric Opera Com
ique Company plans an extensive
season here. They will present "The
Mikado," "H.M.S. Pinafore," the
seldom-played, but very beautiful
"lolanthe," and other pieces equally
famous.
In the cast are many favorites, in
cluding Dorothy Whitmore, who
starred in George M. Cohen's suc
cessful "The Merry Malones." Alan
Rogers, the leading tenor, made a
hit in "Rose Marie," and in the Shu
bert production of Max Reinhardt's
"Die Fiedermaus." The famous mu
sic will be played under the direc
tion of Arthur Kay.
No Sunday performances will be
given and the matinees will be on
Wednesdays and Saturdays.
