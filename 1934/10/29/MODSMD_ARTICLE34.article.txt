SHAKESPEARE COMPANY
The Merchant of Venice — Last
Wednesday evening's performance j
of The Merchant of Venice found
Thornton and his company, perhaps
weary from their afternoon presenta- J
tion of Roineo and Juliet. The actors, l
undoubtedly hampered by the un
certain work of Phoebe Clark as
Portia, gave performances lacking in
smoothness and ease. Thornton's
Shylock needed energy and variety,
and his gestures were somewhat
meaningless. Greater variation in
tone in his part would certainly have
added vitality and suspense to the
courtroom scene. A number of mo
ments were gripping; outstanding
work was contributed by Charles
Hurtgen, whose deliciously amusing
Launcelot Gobbo was one of the high
points of the play, and by two actors
prominent on the Stanford stage
during the past year, Robert Brauns
as Gratiano, and Frances Slanina as
Nerissa, who did perhaps the most
consistently good work of the eve
ning.
The Taming of the Shrew — On
Thursday the actors, apparently en
tirely recovered from their faults of
the preceding night, dashed through
The Taming of the Shrew with a
zest, speed and smoothness which
delighted an audience of Shake
speare enthusiasts. The youthful en
ergy and vitality of the whole troupe
shows itself to best advantage in this
gay comedy. This, together with
King Lear, is to be presented by
Thornton and his company on the
campus, November 14, under the
sponsorship of the English Club.
The cast, without exception, con
tributed lively and earnest perform
ances. Exceptionally enjoyable were
the quavering, clownish servants,
with Brauns executing some acro
batic falls undreamed of in his un
dergraduate days. Thornton's Petru
chio, starting at an appropriately
mild level, increased in vigor and
strength as the play progressed, while
IViJary Marland's Katherina, pro
ceeding inversely from shrewishness
to tractability, was well-sustained,
with nice attention to tempo.
The costumes were not only beau
tiful, but lavish, and the sets and
lighting, while simple, were ex
tremely effective. Particularly im
pressive was the fifth-act banquet
scene, in which color, lighting, and
group movement combined in de
lightful harmony. If Thornton and
his players continue to give such
vital, swift-paced, and smooth per
formances as this, they deserve to
have a very successful season.
