# Papooses Trounce Trobabes In Scoring Orgy
## FLASHY YEARLINGS TRIM U.S.C. FROSH 27-19 SATURDAY Stanford Team Overcomes 13-Point S. C. Lead In Third Period 
### Warren Breed 
Wild and wooley, wide-open and
brilliant, the S.C.-Card Frosh pre
liminary ended crazily in a 27-19
win for the local yearlings. Frosh
fullback Bill Paulman played a near
perfect game, giving the best passing
exhibition seen hereabouts since
Dusty Allen.
The papooses looked powerless in
the first quarter, sixteen minutes of
play seeing the score 13-0 against
them. Trobabe scoring was all
quarterback Glenn Thompson.
Paulman Stars
By the third quarter the frosh had
come back and scored thrice, making
it 20-13. In those two quarters the
Babe line had completely out
charged S.C.'s forwards, and. Paulr
man's passing had spread out the
Trobabe defense and advanced the
ball almost at will.
Thompson began to flash early.
He intercepted a frosh pass on his
own 40 and proceeded to march 60
yards to a touchdown, carrying the
ball every time and scoring after ten
vicious cracks into the line, Stranske
failed to convert.
Second Troy score came after
Thompson coffin-cornered a punt at
the frosh three-yard line. Paulman
kicked out, but Thompson took the
ball on the dead run and was
brought down only at the eight-yard
line. It took him four plays to
plunge it over, held by a stiffening
Card frosh line. Stranske converted,
and Troy was away off, 13-0.
Coach Bradshaw's men were soon
to counter. Taking the ball on the
S.C. 48, Paulman tossed to Tom Col
lins, frosh half, for 24 yards. Collins
threw one to Grant Stone, end, on
the 12. S.C. recovered a fumble on
the next play, but the kick was
short, and went to the frosh on the
36. On the first play Paulman
chucked a long one to Jimmy Coffis
and a touchdown. Paulman con
verted.
Troy Walls Crumble
Jeff Cravath's babes were thor
oughly on the defensive now. Again
getting the ball at midfield, the frosh
were off again. Coffis slashed off
tackle to the Troy 43. Paulman faded
back to pass but, seeing no receiver,
Bambled to the 11.
A pass to sub-half Leo Madlem lost
two, then Madlem carried the ball
out of bounds to the three. Stone
caught Paulman's easy flip over the
goal line to even the count at 13 all.
With 30 seconds left in the half,
Wright, Trobabe sub, grabbed the
kickoff and ran 85 yards from the
goal line, only stopped by frosh
quarter Bill Roberts as the gun
popped in a melodramatic finish.
Papooses made a third 50-yard
march to score in the third quarter
after center Nellie Heath intercepted
an S.C. pass on the 50. Paulman's
bucking and his passes to Stone and
Collins' jaunts made the yards, with
Stone catching one over the line.
Paulman converted for 20-13.
In the fourth quarter, after a 55-
yard Paulman punt, Thompson un
corked a long pass to Bill Gaisford,
who romped over the line, the pass
and run netting 69 yards. With the
tying run tied up in the convert, full
back Stranske missed it, leaving the
frosh ahead at 20-19.
The last score came when Thomp
son's kick was blocked on his own
two-yard line, and the frosh got the
ball on downs. Tom Collins crossed
them up with a pretty sweep around
right end and Paulman converted,
with the final score 27-19.
Papooses completed a dozen
passes for an average of four out of
five. That was the margin of victory.
The sinuous Thompson and the
rangy Gaisford were the whole Troy
show. The Card line was charging
low and opening holes for the backs.
Ed Gillette called his plays nicely
for the frosh.
