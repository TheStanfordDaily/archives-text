frosh football field, 4 o'clock

frosh baseball field, 4 o'clock
Alpha Delts vs. Theta Chi, at frosh
baseball field, 4 o'clock
El Toro vs. A.K.L., at frosh football
field, 5 o'clock
Two games of intramural touch
football Friday saw Phi Sigma Kappa
roll over El Cuadro, 31} to 0, and Zeta
Psi, by slipping over a score early,
beat Beta Thuta Pi 7 to 0.
Strong play by Tod Stice, George
Worley, Herbert Griffin, Bob Mon
davi, and Howard Gates, who each
caught touchdown passes from Bob
Wardwell, and three conversions
after touchdowns piled up a com
manding lead lor the Phi Sigs by the
time the game was called mid-way
in the second half on account of
darkness.
Pass Tallies
For Zeta Psi a pass, Dud Sales to
Richard Taylor, netted six points,
and the seventh was added on a pass,
George Wyman to Ralph Kingsbury.
This edge was enough to last the
game against the Betas, despite the
play by Bud Sophian and Frank
Ingersoll.
Tomorrow's games feature the
clash of two undefeated and pow
erful intramural squads, the Alpha
Delts and Theta Chi. Sigma Nu, last
year's champions, will also face tough
competition in the twice-defeated
but strong D.U. squad.
Two Defaulted
Failure of teams to appear prompt
ly for games scheduled for 4 o'clock
is forcing the 5 o'clock games to run
into darkness, and more than one
of the later games has been called
for this reason. Giff Myers, assistant
intramural manager, asks a prompt
start by all teams.
Friday's games resulted in Sigma
Nu II winning by Menlo Juniors'
default, and Forgers beating the Phi
Kaps by the same route.
