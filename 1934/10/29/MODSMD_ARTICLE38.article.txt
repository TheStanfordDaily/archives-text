## 
### 
The sports editor could not speak 1
to Sylvestre J. Drofnats yesterday.
Assistant editors couid only bow. For
Sylvestre J. had batted 94 per cent
in packing Saturday's football
| games, and ordinary mortals were
not in his class. He did give a few |
curt words to the editor, however-.
"I picked the S.C. game within one j
touchdown and a half," snapped out
Drofnats in an austere manner.
"How did you like the game?"
asked the chief.
"Triolo was all over the field,"
whips back Droffi. "I didn't watch
the game, all I saw was Triolo and j
parts of the Macon. Triolo outper
formed the Macon."
"How did you manage to predict '
the exact score of the Washington-
California game?"
] "I knew that the Cal football team ,
was tired out from reading the Daily j
Californian .editorials," said the
i mystic.
| "But why did you miss on the San
i Jose-Nevada game?"
"Well, I didn't figure that it would
get several Degroots fair and |
warmer."
Borne on a tide of frenzied exu- i
berance, Drofnats was washed out of !
i the Daily office, and hoisted on the i
shoulders of an eager throng of stu- !
; dents—the lyin' of the hour.
