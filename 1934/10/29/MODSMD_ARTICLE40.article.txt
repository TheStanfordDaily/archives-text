# CARD WATER POLOISTS GIVE S.C. SEPTET 13-2 DRENCHING
## 
### Roger Kimball 
Stanford ran wild over Southern
California in water polo Saturday
i still more than in football, since the
I Indians swamped the -Trojans 13 to
| 2, to keep first place in the confer
j ence standings.
With the U.S.C. seven never dan
' gerous to the Card win, attention
I centered largely on the superb play
of Captain Leo Cook and Vlad Tara
nik, Cardinal forwards. Cook, who
is in line for all-American honors,
peppered the Trojan goal with seven
scoring shots, but even this record
was only one up on Taranik's.
Cook, Taranik Star .
"The Red Raider," who sprints for
Nort Thornton's great team, scored
the remaining six goals, several of
them on bullet-like angle shots.
These two star seniors proved
themselves as good as any water po
loists ever seen in the Encina tanks,
including even the all-American
Phil Daubenspeck, Olympic Games
star.
Even with all their original bril
liance, Cook and Taranik starred
mainly because of the top-notch play
of the whole Stanford team. Coach
Thornton got a good line on his re
serves by using 15 men, and every
one of them looked good. Bill
Woodard, guard, and Jack Haslaeher
at goalie played particularly well,
stopping cold the Trojans' few
threats after the first two minutes.
Cards Start Slowly
Starting slowly after hearing of
California's 9 to 1 victory over U.S.C.
Friday, the Cards let the visitors slip
through them for two clever side
shots by Gordon Warner, Trojan for
ward. Fired up by this, Stanford
gained control of the ball, and wasted
no time in springing Taranik loose
for a goal from the corner.
Just after this Leo Cook gave a
hint of what he was going to do to
the southerners by hurling a beaiity
into the net while almost sunk in the
water, with two guards hanging on
him. The huge Indian leader then
broke the tie with a short one which
made the score 3 to 2, in favor of
Stanford.

i Both sides missed numerous long
shots in the closing minutes of the"
first half, but the game wasn't close
j enough to produce the wild, rough
play of the U.C.L.A. clash. Vlad
Taranik counted twice more before
the gun to take the individual scor
i ing lead with three goals to Cook's
; two and the Trojans' two.
Spurt Marks End .
"Nort" told his boys between
! halves that he expected seven goals
! in the final period, and they made
; eight for him with little trouble.
Keeping the ball nearly all the time,
Stanford swept down the tank every
; minute or so, with Woodard, Wiget,
i and later their substitutes leeding
' Cook and Taranik for shot after shot.
The final gun brought the finish
not only of the Trojans, but also of
: Junior Manager Sam Roberts' pants
when Timekeeper Jim Cayton fired
a blank without even looking behind
him just as Roberts dashed up.

Cards Start Slowly
Starting slowly after hearing of
California's 9 to 1 victory over U.S.C.
Friday, the Cards let the visitors slip
through them for two clever side
shots by Gordon Warner, Trojan for
ward. Fired up by this, Stanford
gained control of the ball, and wasted
no time in springing Taranik loose
for a goal from the corner.
Just after this Leo Cook gave a
hint of what he was going to do to
the southerners by hurling a beaiity
into the net while almost sunk in the
water, with two guards hanging on
him. The huge Indian leader then
broke the tie with a short one which
made the score 3 to 2, in favor of
Stanford.

i Both sides missed numerous long
shots in the closing minutes of the"
first half, but the game wasn't close
j enough to produce the wild, rough
play of the U.C.L.A. clash. Vlad
Taranik counted twice more before
the gun to take the individual scor
i ing lead with three goals to Cook's
; two and the Trojans' two.

With the U.S.C. seven never dan

I centered largely on the superb play
of Captain Leo Cook and Vlad Tara

is in line for all-American honors,
peppered the Trojan goal with seven
scoring shots, but even this record
was only one up on Taranik's.

themselves as good as any water po

including even the all-American

Even with all their original bril

mainly because of the top-notch play
of the whole Stanford team. Coach
