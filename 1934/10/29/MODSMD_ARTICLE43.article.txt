## 
### Der Lanidrac 
Victory is sweet. But never so |
sweet as when it comes at the last j
minute when hopes are down and f
the vision of "at the bottom of the |
standings" looms.
Stanford climbed out of the soccer
cellar Saturday. They beat San Josei
State 3-2. But they did it in such
a skin-of-the-teeth fashion that j
sweet victory was truly saccha'rine !
sweet.

The record of the soccermen is now
two lost and one won. By winning |
Saturday they avoided the fate of,
being at the bottom of the conference i
standings — something that hasn't
happened to a Stanford team in 15 ,
years.
To Ron Row, Miguel Gomez, and I
Al Dibblee goes a big part of the pile
of crodit for the Card win. They
scored the three goals, and they j
scored them at times when they were ;
the most desperately needed.
The first came in the third quar
ter with the score 1-0 against the
Indians. A penalty was called against j
San Jose. Row came up from inside
left to take the kick. It was a high, 1
twisting shot that found the extreme I
right-hand corner of the net, yards
out of rear-h of the goalie.
Mike Gomez put Stanford into the i

lead late in the fourth quarter \vhen
he rammed home one of his charac
teristically terrific shots.
Then Maloney shifted his, back- ;
field, moving Wilson from back '
into goal and putting McCoarmick in j
at the back position. Immediately j
Main, San Jose center forward,
broke through and scored. This tied
up the game, the state men's first
score having come in the first half
when Wigglesworth bangjbd one in.
The game ended with the score i
two all, making it necessary for over- :
time to be played.

For the ten-minute over-time pe- ]
riod Maloney put in Halaby, Forhan, '
and Dibblee. In a few minutes these j
three began their attack. And, seiz
ing one of those split-second oppor- j
tunities when there is an opening to .
the goal, Dibblee crashed one in for ]
the winning sccft-e.
Saturday's performance was prob- i
ably the best put up by the Card
team this season. White, Gonzales, '
Bullis, Wilson, Walker, and Row were j
all consistent in their general good !
play.

Saturday they avoided the fate of,
being at the bottom of the conference i
standings — something that hasn't
happened to a Stanford team in 15 ,
years.
To Ron Row, Miguel Gomez, and I
Al Dibblee goes a big part of the pile
of crodit for the Card win. They
scored the three goals, and they j
scored them at times when they were ;
the most desperately needed.
The first came in the third quar
ter with the score 1-0 against the
Indians. A penalty was called against j
San Jose. Row came up from inside
left to take the kick. It was a high, 1
twisting shot that found the extreme I
right-hand corner of the net, yards
out of rear-h of the goalie.
Mike Gomez put Stanford into the i

lead late in the fourth quarter \vhen
he rammed home one of his charac
teristically terrific shots.
Then Maloney shifted his, back- ;
field, moving Wilson from back '
into goal and putting McCoarmick in j
at the back position. Immediately j
Main, San Jose center forward,
broke through and scored. This tied
up the game, the state men's first
score having come in the first half
when Wigglesworth bangjbd one in.
The game ended with the score i
two all, making it necessary for over- :
time to be played.
Play Overtilme
For the ten-minute over-time pe- ]
riod Maloney put in Halaby, Forhan, '
and Dibblee. In a few minutes these j
three began their attack. And, seiz
ing one of those split-second oppor- j
tunities when there is an opening to .
the goal, Dibblee crashed one in for ]
the winning sccft-e.
Saturday's performance was prob- i
ably the best put up by the Card
team this season. White, Gonzales, '
Bullis, Wilson, Walker, and Row were j
all consistent in their general good !
play.

Victory is sweet. But never so |
sweet as when it comes at the last j
minute when hopes are down and f
the vision of "at the bottom of the |
standings" looms.
Stanford climbed out of the soccer
cellar Saturday. They beat San Josei
State 3-2. But they did it in such
a skin-of-the-teeth fashion that j
sweet victory was truly saccha'rine !
