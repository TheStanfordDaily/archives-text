# DICTIONARY OF SLANG
## 
### 
"Slanguage," for centuries the
vulgar step-brother of language, re
ceived a boost out of the gutter on
October 22 when the "Dictionary of
American Slang," by Maurice H.
Wesen, associate professor of Eng
lish at the University of Nebraska,
was published.
The new president of the Univer
sity of Washington, Dr. Paul Sieg,
has never seen a crew race, although
he is president of an institution re
nowned for its teams.
