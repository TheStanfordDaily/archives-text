# RUSSIAN CHORUS TO OPEN SERIES
## First of Annual Concerts Tomorrow Night 
### 
This season marks the beginning
of the fifth American tour of the
Don Cossacks, celebrated Russian
male chorus, who will make their
second appearance on the Stanford
campus when they appear in concert
at the Pavilion tomorrow night un
der the auspices of the. A.S.S.U. Con
cert Series. The performance will
begin at 8 o'clock.
The Cossacks, organized as a
chorus some ten years ago, still
rigidly observe the strict discipline
that was found in the army of the
czar before the revolution. The
greatest penally that can be given
one of these singing Russians is to
be told that he must forego one of
their concerts, a penalty for missing
rehearsal. Only once in ten years of
their existence has any member of
the Don Cossacks received this pun
ishment.
The program the chorus presents
is divided into three parts. The first
group is devoted sacred music by
Gretchaninoff, Tchaikowsky, and
others. The next two groups hold
what to many are the gems of the
program: the beautiful and haunting
folk mplodies of Russia, songs uf the
Ukraine, of the Don, of the monoto
nous wastes of Siberia. On every
program, whether included origi
nally or sung as an encore, figures
the famous Volga Boatman's song.
Both season tickets and seats for
this performance alone may still be
obtained, Norman Barnes, Concert
Series manager, stated yesterday.
Prices l'ange from $2 to $3 for stu
dent season books, $3 to $5 for gen
eral season books, and $1 to $2 for
tickets for the Don Cossack concert
only. Tickets may be obtained at
the A.S.S.U. office in the Old Union
or at Keeble's in Palo Alto.
