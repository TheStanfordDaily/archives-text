# 'Old Boy' Steals Own Stuff, Copy Found in Office
## 
### 
Old Boy Gordon Steedman finally
found the villain who ran off with
all his Chaparral copy for the Big
Game number, and it turned out to
be himself.
After scouring the campus and
bearding many lions in many dens,
Steedman finally took his cake of
soap and scoured the sumptuous
Chappie office. Under a particularly
ornamental scouring, the Venerable
Cuckoo found the sheaf of twitters
sleeping like a baby.
Now that the copy is found, Steed
man announces that he has decided
to publish the Big Game number
after all. Final deadline for copy is
November 1, the night after Hal
lowe'en. All wild and uncurbed
writers and artists must get their
material in by that deadline.
The return of one Gilman Gist to
the Farm after an absence due to
sickness has moved the many Chap
pie contributors to continue with
their inspired dementias. Gist has
been a prominent contributor to
Chappie in past years.
