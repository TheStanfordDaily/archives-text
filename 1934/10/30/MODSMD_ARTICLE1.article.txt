# CARDS STILL IN FULL STRENGTH AFTER S.C. TILT
## Adams' Bruised Ankle Only Casualty as Indians Re-Open Practice PREPARE FOR U.C.L.A. Stanford May Under-Rate Bruins Saturday 
### 
Stanford beat Troy Saturday and
set a record of being the first team
to defeat "old S.C. on Northern Cal
ifornia in recent years.
But the Indians set another record
and emerged from combat with the
toughies from cinemaland without
sustaining a single injury.
Woody Adams was bearing the
nearest, thing to a casualty at prac
tice Monday night when he showed
up with a wrenched ankle. The
muscle injury may, but probably will

not, keep him out of the U.C.L.A.
game next Saturday.
Practice Listless
Every other team member was
out and running through rather list
less Monday afternoon practice as
Tiny Thornhill confined drilling to
running signals, line conditioning,
and some dummy scrimmage.
While the Indian football players
are planning dire actions against the
colossal nerve of Washington, who
plans to eliminate Stanford from con
ference honors November 10, the
directors of Cardinal gridiron fate
are anxiously wishing they had
scheduled a bye or contracted to play
a good second-rate high .school team
this week.
Over-Confident?
Opinion seems to verge on calling
U.C.L.A. just a weak "little sister."
A very unhealthy state of mind, say
those mentally concerned with Stan
ford's football campaign.
So Thornhill will apply a strong
dose of forgetting Washington until
next Saturday night, and will admin
ister a counter-dose of long drill
this week.
His plan is to keep Stanford right
at the peak reached against South
ern California for this week, and to
build that into a new elevation for
the Husky game.
