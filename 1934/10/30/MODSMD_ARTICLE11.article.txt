i A small, thin man who looks like
i a vest-pocket edition of Woodrow
i Wilson is well on his way to pcr
! forming a political miracle. The
j miricle is that California—a usually
; conservative state—should put the
country's No. 1 Radical within a
single step of the governorship. What
lies behind the miracle?
Upton Sinclair has written on
many causes, supported many. Most
of them have been lost causes. So
| it isn't surprising that he should get
'along so well in Southern California
: —home of everything from Sister
! Aimee to Utopia, Inc. So here is the
! first reason for Democratic Candi
| date Sinclair.
I A distinguished English visitor
once said Southern California had
achieved the ultimate segregation
1 of the unfit. This may or may not
he so. It probably isn't. But the
fact remains that there are more
elderly retired people, more luck
| less unemployed and more foot
loose wanderers per square mile
than anywhere in the United
States.
Most of them are far from pros
! perous and have plenty of spare
! time on their hands. They have
; used this time to join some cause or
| another. In the past year the causes

1 have gotten bigger and bigger. B.E.
(Before Epic) the biggest one of
them all was Utopia, Inc.—with about
100,000 members.
Utopia, Inc., is just what it means,
only they haven't got there yet. It
started mainly out of the disappoint
ment of retired lowa farmers at not
finding L.A. streets paved with gold.
It got lots of help from Messrs'
, Beesemeyer & Julian, etc., who man
aged to get away with what gold
and cash the lowans did have. The
I society has been strong enough to
; bedevil the two morning dailies by
cancelling 30,000 subscriptions held
: among its membership.
With such following as this Sin
clair started to build. He was clever
j enough to change himself from a
Socialist to a Democrat, though he is
promising more than Socialism ever
hoped to. But Democrats are ac
cepted in polite society; Socialists are
i supposed to be welcome only at pink
i teas. Anyway, there are a lot more
Democrats than Socialists.
The wisest thing Sinclair ever did
was to promise lax exemption to all
homes worth less than $.'lOOO, Most
iof the families in L.A. county are
| property owners; most of their
houses are worth less than $.'i0()0.
! Everybody wants lower taxes; so

Editor's note: This morning, the Daily presents one of a series of articles by its Harvard correspondent,
who has made a special study of the campaign of Upton Sinclair. Bangs endeavors to provide a clearer
picture of the strange personality who is facing one of the most sensational character attacks in California
history. Unbiased, the Daily merely offers a bit of information, interesting and true.

1 Upton must have enlisted .several
j hundred thousand votes from this
| source alone.
Sinclair also favors old-age pen
i sions for everybody. Presto—a lot
I more votes from old people with
nothing to look forward to. Then
there is another thing. All the job
less are to be put to work in idle
j factories to make goods for them
selves. There are at least half a
i million jobless in the state; quite a
I few votes here, too.
Then there are the people known
las Reds: the Communists, Ihe So
! cialists; the Cannery & Agricultur
al Workers' Industrial Union. There
aren't over 30.000 of them altogether.
I Still they support Sinclair to a man.
So far, then, Sinclair hacking
is not composed of radicals who
want to overthrow the government,
j hul of disappointed and disillu
! sioned Americans who have little
to look forward to and want some
thins better. These people form a
1 very sizeable group in California.
To them Upton Sinclair is the
means to an end—the way to bet
ter things. It's no use telling them
the liuman race is hopelessly op
timistic: they will go on hoping,
anyhow.
Tomorrow: Sinclair—The Man.
