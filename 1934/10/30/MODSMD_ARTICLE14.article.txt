# JONES GIVES AIR LECTURE ON RAILWAYS
## Emphasizes Heavy Losses Of Traffic Suffered In Last Decade 
### Virginia Johnson 
"The Outlook for Railroads" was
the subject of Professor Eliot Jones'
talk yesterday evening at 8 o'clock
over station KGO, during the Stan
ford University Hour. The economics
professor made it clear that the rail
roads have sustained heavy losses in
both passenger and freight traffic,
and that these losses can hardly be
recouped by higher rates. "Class A
railroads will not earn their fixed
charges in 1934, and probably not in
1935," prophesies Professor Jones.
Professor Jones did not try to "un
screw the unscrutable," but set forth
some of the difficulties with which
railroads have to contend and the
prospect of overcoming them. Since
railroads' earnings are dependent
not only on revenue but on operating
costs, Professor Jones analyzed all
the factors in the situation, which he
sums up as pointing toward in
creased operating costs in 1935.
Whether railroads will be pros
perous in the future will depend on
the difference between their reve
nues and their expenses. Whereas
the operating expenses declined two
and a half billion dollars between
1929 and 1933, the operating reve
nues declined nearly three and one
half billion dollars.
Traffic Declines
One of the outstanding facts in the
situation is that the volume of traf
fic since 1920 experienced a great
decline; the passenger traffic of the
railroads in 1933 was only one-third
of what it was in 1920. Professor
Jones explained this factor is due to
the growth in the number of pas
senger automobiles, buses, and air
planes, but principally the former.
Though the truck has cut severely
into railroad traffic, and may cut
even more severely in the years to
come, there remains a huge volume
of traffic that the truck has little
chance to capture. In fact, the whole
sale branch of land transportation,
such as cereals, flour, lumber, and
pig iron, and on hauls of substantial
length, such as coal, coke, and iron,
as distinct from retail distributive
movements of these products, will
undoubtedly be conducted by the
railroads.
Railroad Failures
"As might be expected," said Pro
fessor Jones, "many railroads have
failed. Railroad bonds, of which one
and one-half billion dollars are now
in default, are widely held by life
insurance and fire insurance com
panies, by savings banks, colleges,
churches, and philanthropic institu
tions. Railroad insolvency thus
strikes at the very foundation of our
economic and social structure. Yet
in 1933, so great was the decline in
traffic, they employed nearly a mil -
lion less men than they had em
ployed ten years before; and new low
records were chalked up for pur
poses of equipment."
