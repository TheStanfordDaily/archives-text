# SATIRICAL ART NOW EXHIBITED
## 
### 
Can satire in art be decorative?
The drawings and paintings of Les
lie M. Crandall, now on exhibit at
the graphic art department, answer
this question affirmatively.
There are satirical drawings of
historical characters: of Queen
Elizabeth, Emperor Jones, and
Shakespeare's Ophelia. There are
also grotesque negro characteriza
tions.
There are satirical drawings of
medieval subjects, which received
high ratings in a contest heid by the
Limited Editions Club to illustrate a
limited edition of books dealing with
ancient and renaissance subjects.
Crandall's work illustrates the
"Legend of Ulenspiegl," a story
dealing with the time corresponding
approximately to the French, Rabe
lais, and Italian, Boccacio.
All the works are of an exag
gerated qualityâ€”they are satirical;
ihey show a feeling for design. They
will be 011 exhibit for two weeks.
Crandall is a young San Francisco
artist whose work has been much
commented on by artists of the bay
region. He received scholarships to
study at the California School of Fine
Arts and is now doing commercial
work.
Anyone contemplating purchasing
drawings should inquire of Graphic
Art Professors Farmer or Mendelo
