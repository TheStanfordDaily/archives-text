# Letters More Difficult
## 
### 
Originating from Sherman Lock
wood, tennis coach, two proposals
will be presented to Ex Committee
either of which will make it more
difficult for tennis players to get a
Block '"S."
Loekwood says: "I feel that Block
"S" letters for varsity tennis have
been too easy to earn in the past and
for the good of the prestige of the
Block "S" stricter rules should be
made governing the award of such
letters.
"I will outline two suggestions
that have been approved by the var
sity tennis squad and also by Mr.
Buggc."
The two proposals relate to the
number of conference matches
played by each man.
