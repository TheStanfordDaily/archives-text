# U.C.L.A. â€” Liberal, Free, State University

The University of California at Los Angeles
is very happy today with the announeeinent
I hut freedom of speech and thought no longer
exists, at all times, on the southern campus.
Yesterday, the student body president at
U.C.L.A. was suspended from the university,
along with four other students, for the period
of one year. They were charged by the uni
versity's provost with "using their student
offices to destroy the university by handing
if over to an organized group of Communistic
students," while it was declared that the
National Students League, on the U.C.L.A.
campus, is ;i "Communist organization."
Whether the chargest be true, the Daily
does not know and cannot say. Dr. Ernest
Moore, provost, must have known what he
was doing when he made public his decisions,
must have had pretty good reasons for the
<loi ng.
However, one reads the news stories and
learns that five students have been expelled
from a public institution for holding certain
beliefs. At least four of the five were what
common parlance has labeled "student lead
ers." They were prominent in campus affairs,
possessed certain opinions, and are no longer
with the university.
Perhaps the ousted individuals proved ob
jectionable beyond the point of pure Com
munism. If so, the authorities should so state
in their official announcement of the proceed
ings. Hut to declare that, because certain
persons were "Communistic," they have been
expelled from any American university, is
another thing.
Whether we agree with so-called Commu
nistic ideas or not, and most of us do not, all
realize that persecution does nothing greater
than enable the martyr to thrive.
Is Ibis America?
