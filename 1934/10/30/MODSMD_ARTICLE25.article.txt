While I he* frenzied political struggle grows
more furious, more hitler, and more insane,
California's most crucial state election is rap
idly approaching. One week from today the
voters will decide whether California will
swing sharply to tlie Left or to the Right,
politically and economically speaking. Nei
ther side is pulling its punches at this stage
of the game and no one knows what the next
lew days may bring forth.
All of which is good and sufficient reason
why tomorrow night's debate between Ches
ter Howell and Louis Martlett should be a real,
knock-down and drag-out battle of wits, prob
ably proving nothing but at least suggesting
a great deal lo anyone who cares to listen. And
there are likely to be plenty of people who
do care to listen.
Chester Howell, whatever one's own politi
cal views may be, is generally recognized as
one of the best-known and ablest exponents
ol Republicanism and conservatism on the
Pacific Coast. For many years, both journal
istically and oratorically, he has been a lead
ing stalwart in presenting the Republican
case.
On the other side of the rostrum, however,
there will be no neophyte in politics, no im
practical idealist carried away by a wave of
I topian hope. In Democratic circles Louis
Rartlcll holds a position comparable to Mow
ell's place in the Republican camp. Former
mayor of Berkeley, past president of I he
League of California Municipalities, and
prominent San Francisco attorney, he is well
able to uphold his side of the argument.
It will probably not be a dispassionate sort
of debate. Partisan orators are not like that,
especially six days before the election. Con
siderable heal will doubtless be shed on the

political situation. Hut heat ami light, unlike
gasoline and alcohol, often are found together.
A little illumination might help.
