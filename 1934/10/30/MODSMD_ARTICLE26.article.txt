# Ex Committee Invites You
## 
### 
The Executive Committee today introduces
a policy which, if it is to he effective hence
forth, should do a lot toward removing the
stigma of "railroading" that has sometimes
been applied to its actions in the past. A pro
gram of business to he considered will be
prepared in advance of each meeting and
published in the Daily.
Thus forewarned, interested parties will
have the opportunity of appearing at the
meeting and relieving themselves of all gripes,
objections, suggestions, and approbation.
Ex Committee, doubtless considering that
it has taken a vital liberalizing step, will be
interested in student response; we suggest
that the critically inclined public that has
contented itself with derogatory blasts from
the sidelines, either sincere or picayunish, will
tonight gather around and voice their opin
ions.
