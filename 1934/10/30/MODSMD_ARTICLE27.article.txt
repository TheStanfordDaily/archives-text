# Tonight the Cossacks
## 
### 
Tonight 3(> former officers of the Imperial
Russian Army will inarch on to the wooden
platform at the Basketball Pavilion and pre
sent a concert which, if judged by past per
formances, should equal or surpass anything
to be heard at Stanford this year.
Those who heard Ihe Don Cossack chorus
when it appeared here two years ago will need
no urging to attend tonight's concert. Those
who did not hear it have a treat in store for
them that lliey should not miss.
Powerful bass voices, shrill soprano, and
every range in between will reverberate
through the building in tones curiously like
those of some great organ. The Don Cossack
repertoire varies from wild, stirring folk songs
to dignified, majestic sacred music.
Miss tonight's concert and regret it. We
mere I v warn.
