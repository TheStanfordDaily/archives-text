Of course, Stanford students have always
understood that the Hollywood - inspired
conception of a college student, pictured as
an indolent profligate attired in dragging pan
taloons and with a cigarette dangling from
bis lower lip, was a fallacy. But when we
turn to real life, and find a group of students
attempting to keep body and soul together

California, we question which extreme is the
more disheartening.
Frankly, the value of higher learning is
not worth the price of such self-deprivation.
With all sympathy to the men and women
who have set up college as a god and worship
at the altar in this manner, we advise them
to give up and get out now before they find
themselves suffering from impaired health
and life-long cynicism, and nothing to show
for their travail but a scrap of sheepskin.
