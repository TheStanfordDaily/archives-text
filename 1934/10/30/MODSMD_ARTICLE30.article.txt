### CEDRIC LARSON 
WITH YAMATO ICHIHASHI

Universal interest today is focused on the prelim
inary London Naval Conference outcome. Japan's fight
for naval parity is the crux of the conference.
Is Japan warranted in her demand to quash the
celebrated 10-10-6 tonnage ratio, heritage of the Wash
ington Naval Conference of 1921-22? Yes, is the opin
ion of Dr. Yamato Ichihashi, professor of Japanese
history and government, and expert in Far Eastern
affairs.
Dr. Ichihashi clarifies his affirmative by stating:
"Irrespective of press reports, Japan today seeks de jure
naval parity rather than de facto parity. She is no
longer content to be relegated to a secondary cate
gory, which implication inheres in the 10-10-6 ratio.
Japan does not want a bigger navy, but an attainment
of theoretical parity. She is fighting for principle.
"Japanese naval experts wish to substitute total
tonnage for the old category-of-ships as common
denominator in seeking a satisfactory solution of
(he vexing naval ratio problem now confronting the
Big Three. Maximum tonnage to (lie casual news
paper reader may appear a simple technical ques
tion, but actually it is an issue fraught with great
political complexity.
"Japan is hoping to arrive at parity by reducing the
size of capital ships and cruiser armament. She is
undertaking to reach equality through a scaling down
on maximum tonnage. She wishes- to replace ratio
allocation by reduction in the total existing naval ton
nage of the great powers.
"If no agreement is reached, the entire question
will go by the board. Just as Italy will not accept a
ratio with reference to France due to national pres
tige, so the Japanese government and people are not
willing to receive a 60 per cent allocation vis-a-vis the
British and American naval tonnage. The Japanese
position is one of prestige from Avhich there will be no
retreat.
"Japan proposes to minimize offensive ships, and
Great Britain, France, and Italy concur.' These
capital ships, including airplane carriers, are veri
table floating arsenals which only the American
naval technicians really want.
"United States should realize with the approaching
withdrawal of her sovereignty from the Philippine
Islands, the need for these long-distance cruising types
of craft will not be so necessary as heretofore. Some
American naval experts argue, however, that (he loss of
the islands make (his type of long-range craft all (he
more necessary. This question will have to be threshed
out at the conference.
"A 'gentlemen's agreement' has been suggested
as one way out of the naval dilemma. The difliculty
inhering in (his solution in my opinion lies in the
fact that the American commitment would prob
ably be in the form of an executive agreement, of
doubtful juridicial status.
"Just as the 'gentlemen's immigration agreement'
was abruptly abrogated in 1924 after bein operative 17
years, Congress might similarly over-ride an executive
naval understanding. I therefore believe these consid
erations practically eliminate the possible 'gentlemen's
agreement' solution."
