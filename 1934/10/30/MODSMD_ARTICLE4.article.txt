# KINGSFORD-SMITH REACHES HAWAII; L.A. FINAL GOAL
## 
### 
HONOLULU, Oct. 29 HP).—The
storm gods of the equator sought to j
swamp Charles Kingsford-Smith's
northbound transpacific plane with i
what the airmen called "A well of i
water" last midnight, but he and |
Captain P. G. Taylor, navigator,;
fought I heir way through and landed |
.safely at Wheeler field here this j
morning in time for breakfast.
They had completed the second i
leg of what is generally conceded j
the most hazardous over-water air!
course in the world in 25 hours and j
five minutes in their three-hop flight j
from Brisbane to California.
In all the 3,197-mile trip they '
sighted land only once—the Phoenix '
Islands, which lie comfortably below
the equator west of the 170 th mc- !
vidian. They saw no ships—no ships I
saw them. Their only contact with
the world was their short-wave ra- i
dio.
Kingsford-Smith said he probably i
would take o(T tomorrow for Los |
Angeles, on the last lap of the flight I
he started from Brisbane Saturday
iiflcrnoon, October 20.
