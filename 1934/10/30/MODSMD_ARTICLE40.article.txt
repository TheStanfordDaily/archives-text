# Indian Babes May Meet Cal Without Loss
## Unbeaten Papooses To Play Bakersfield Saturday 
### Warren Breed 
It,looks as if the Card Frosh's un
defeated record will mean a light to
the finish in the Little Big Game two
weeks hence. Jim Bradshaw's babes
have won five games so far, and if
nothing drastic happens, they should
not 'lose to Bakersfield J.C. Satur
day.'
Up at Berkeley, on the other hand,
Clint Evans has a freshman eleven
that; has absolutely cleaned up on
everything. The Calcubs of '38 are
reputed to top anything in frosh
iootbull for years, even rating over
the class of '35, with Meek. Boone,
Christie, and the other flashes.
The game at Berkeley November
10 should be a classic in open, daring
play. Both teams have scored prac
tically at will over opponents. Both
have outplayed the tough S.C. frosh
and annihilated the highly-rated San
Mateo J.C. bunch. Both have strong
linek and six or eight fast, hard
hitting backs that can kick and pass
as well.
Coach Pleased
COach Bradshaw has every reason
to be immensely pleased with the
play of his men in the S.C. babe tilt
Saturday. The line functioned, the
reverses worked smoothly, the pass
ing attack was exceptional, and
quarterback Ed Gillette showed nice
judgment in calling his plays.
Eighty per cent of the frosh passes
were completed against the Tro
babes, a record probably unequalled
on the Coast this year. Whenever
yards were needed it was Bill Paul
man, doughty fullback, who tossed
a short one to an end or half, and it
was a first down. Three of the four
Card touchdowns were directly the
result of passes. Paulman threw them
all, Grant Stone caught two and
Jimmy Coffis one.
Bradshaw works his passing attack
so that there is always a doubt in
the opponents' minds as to who is
going to get the ball. Any one of
six eligible men may get the pass,
and Saturday Grant Stone, the prin
ciple snagger, was clear practically
all the time. Not a Troy man was
within five feet of him the two
times he caught the ball over the goal
line.
Paulman Stars
Paulman's passing, of course, was
the stand-out performance of the
forenoon. Whether passing, kicking,
or running, this blond worker is
perfectly under control, rarely show
ing any sign of emotion. When he
passes he waits till someone is in
the dear, then it usually gets to
the clear man. He showed an added
threat Saturday when he could find
no receiver, tucked the ball away,
and yan some two score yards to
put the ball on the S.C. 11-yard line.

On' their first three touchdowns,
the yearling showed sure offensive
power by marching thrice from the
50-yaVd line to the goal. It was here
that Gillette so brilliantly called his
plays, mixing them up like a field
general hardened by four years of
exacting competition. He also car
ried out his blocking assignments,
although never carrying the ball.

From tackle to tackle there is no
outstanding man in the line, but the
seven: of them are always rooting on
the offensive and piling up the inter
ference on the defensive. Tackles are
lrv Henningson and Cyril Oberg,
guards are Jay Holdridge and Russ
McKiriney, and Nellie Heath is at
centey. All can give and take it
for tl|e full 60 minutes.

tically at will over opponents. Both
have outplayed the tough S.C. frosh
and annihilated the highly-rated San
Mateo J.C. bunch. Both have strong
linek and six or eight fast, hard
hitting backs that can kick and pass
as well.
Coach Pleased
COach Bradshaw has every reason
to be immensely pleased with the
play of his men in the S.C. babe tilt
Saturday. The line functioned, the
reverses worked smoothly, the pass
ing attack was exceptional, and
quarterback Ed Gillette showed nice
judgment in calling his plays.
Eighty per cent of the frosh passes
were completed against the Tro
babes, a record probably unequalled
on the Coast this year. Whenever
yards were needed it was Bill Paul
man, doughty fullback, who tossed
a short one to an end or half, and it
was a first down. Three of the four
Card touchdowns were directly the
result of passes. Paulman threw them
all, Grant Stone caught two and
Jimmy Coffis one.
Bradshaw works his passing attack
so that there is always a doubt in
the opponents' minds as to who is
going to get the ball. Any one of
six eligible men may get the pass,
and Saturday Grant Stone, the prin
ciple snagger, was clear practically
all the time. Not a Troy man was
within five feet of him the two
times he caught the ball over the goal
line.
Paulman Stars
Paulman's passing, of course, was
the stand-out performance of the
forenoon. Whether passing, kicking,
or running, this blond worker is
perfectly under control, rarely show
ing any sign of emotion. When he
passes he waits till someone is in
the dear, then it usually gets to
the clear man. He showed an added
threat Saturday when he could find
no receiver, tucked the ball away,
and yan some two score yards to
put the ball on the S.C. 11-yard line.

On' their first three touchdowns,
the yearling showed sure offensive
power by marching thrice from the
50-yaVd line to the goal. It was here
that Gillette so brilliantly called his
plays, mixing them up like a field
general hardened by four years of
exacting competition. He also car
ried out his blocking assignments,
although never carrying the ball.

From tackle to tackle there is no
outstanding man in the line, but the
seven: of them are always rooting on
the offensive and piling up the inter
ference on the defensive. Tackles are
lrv Henningson and Cyril Oberg,
guards are Jay Holdridge and Russ
McKiriney, and Nellie Heath is at
centey. All can give and take it
for tl|e full 60 minutes.
It,looks as if the Card Frosh's un
defeated record will mean a light to
the finish in the Little Big Game two
weeks hence. Jim Bradshaw's babes
have won five games so far, and if
nothing drastic happens, they should
not 'lose to Bakersfield J.C. Satur
day.'
Up at Berkeley, on the other hand,
Clint Evans has a freshman eleven
that; has absolutely cleaned up on
everything. The Calcubs of '38 are
reputed to top anything in frosh
iootbull for years, even rating over
the class of '35, with Meek. Boone,
Christie, and the other flashes.
The game at Berkeley November
10 should be a classic in open, daring
play. Both teams have scored prac
tically at will over opponents. Both
have outplayed the tough S.C. frosh
and annihilated the highly-rated San
Mateo J.C. bunch. Both have strong
linek and six or eight fast, hard
hitting backs that can kick and pass
as well.
