## DON, U.C.L.A. GAMES COMPARED 
### 
The Stanford Indians are on the
same spot this week they were two
weeks ago, only a trifle more so, and
this writer fears for them.
A fortnight ago, the Cardinals
were preparing for San Francisco
University. This week they are pre
paring for U.C.L.A.
But just as they were thinking
of U.S.C. while getting ready for
the Dons, they have their minds
on Washington this week as they
prepare to invade the Southland.
It may be just a bit worse this
time, because the season is farther
along, and Tiny Thornhill's men are
getting tired. They have played a
lot of football since September 15.
