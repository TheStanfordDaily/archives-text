# CARDS MUST BE RIGHT SATURDAY

Stanford can beat U.C.L.A. For
sheer power and ability there is no
comparison between the two. And
the Indians probably will turn on
the power enough to score at least
once.
But their hearts will not he in
their work, and although it is hard
to predict that the Bruins, who
have lost games this year, will
score on a Stanford team that has
not had its goal crossed since the
second game of the season, it is
very possible the Uclan eleven
could slip a touchdown or field
goal over, and that Stanford's
drive would come too late.
U.C.L.A., it must be remem
bered, held California to a 3 to 0
score two weeks ago. Furthermore,
during that game the Southern
"little sister" played completely on
even terms with the Bears, had as
many scoring chances, made approx
imately the same amount of yard
age, and even tried a field goal as
did the Ingram men. And when she
met the Bruins, California was in a
position where she had to show
some fire, and did.
Stanford must be fairly well fired
up to beat any team that is on a
complete par with California. Thai:
is obvious. And Stanford will not
have the psychological advantage
the Bruins do this week.
