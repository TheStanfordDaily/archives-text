# WHO WILL GET ALL-STAR MENTION?
## 
### 
Stanford is loaded with possibili
ties for all-Coast and all-American
mention. Bobby Grayson seems to
be the target of most of the sporting
authorities, with Monk Moscrip a
close second. But what about Bones
Hamilton and Frankie Alustiza?
Also, what about Wes Muller, Bob
Reynolds, and a few of those other
linemen who have permitted the
backfield to function?
But the all-star pickers are not in
Ihe habit of choosing more than one
or two, or at the most three, players
from any one team. So it still looks
like Grayson and Moscrip.
Who knows, maybe next year a
new precedent will be begun, and
some of the other Indian stars will
break in.
—Millard Browne.
