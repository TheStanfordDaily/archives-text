in each league, the Card varsity
water polo team now has a record
of 33 goals scored against four for
their opponents.
Captain Leo Cook, great forward,
leads the individual point-winners
with 17 goals, while Vlad Taranik,
sprint, has 14 to his credit. Bob
Foster and Bill Clemo have each
made one goal in Pacific Coast Con
ference and Northern California
Water Polo League games. j
With four straight wins to his
credit, the Olympic Club is tied
with Stanford for first place in the
league, but Ihe Indians have an un- j
challenged lead in the Conference
standings. This week will put the'
Cardinal forces to their most severe
test of the week, since they will play
three tough games within as many
days.
To Play Athenians
Stanford's first tussle will bo with i
the Athens Club seven tomorrow
night in Oakland. With a record of
two wins and a pair of defeats, the
Club has a much stronger team than '
Lakeside, and will probably give Nor!
Thornton's outfit a closer battle than 1
U.S.C. did.
Hardly back from their transbay j
trip, the Cards will board a train j
Thursday night for Los Angeles, j
where they will play return games i
with the U.C L.A. Bruins and the!
Trojans Friday and Saturday, re- j
spectively. The UJans, who barely |
lost to Stanford, 3 to 2, in a wild
game ten days ago, will rate an even j
chance of revenge over the Indians in !
their home pool.
After Leo Cook had led the Cards j

iu meir easy io 10 <£ win over me j
Trojans Saturday, Coach Fred Cady '
of U.S.C. slated that he regarded the !
Stanford captain as the greatest for
ward in America. When asked if he j
thought Cook was better than Phil'
Daubenspeck, L.A.A.C. ace, Cady re- j
plied, "I'll say so! Why, Cook can j
shoot with a man sitting on his back, 1
and who could ask for more?" The J
Trojan mentor was also high in his |
praise of Taranik, whose swift angle j
shots helped greatly in the over- j
whelming Stanford victory.
The standings now are as follows:
Pacific Coast Conference
Team Won Lost Pet.
Stanford 2 0 1000
U.C.L.A 11 .500
California 11 .500
U.S.C 0 2 .000

in each league, the Card varsity
water polo team now has a record
of 33 goals scored against four for
their opponents.
Captain Leo Cook, great forward,
leads the individual point-winners
with 17 goals, while Vlad Taranik,
sprint, has 14 to his credit. Bob
Foster and Bill Clemo have each
made one goal in Pacific Coast Con
ference and Northern California
Water Polo League games. j
With four straight wins to his
credit, the Olympic Club is tied
with Stanford for first place in the
league, but Ihe Indians have an un- j
challenged lead in the Conference
standings. This week will put the'
Cardinal forces to their most severe
test of the week, since they will play
three tough games within as many
days.
To Play Athenians
Stanford's first tussle will bo with i
the Athens Club seven tomorrow
night in Oakland. With a record of
two wins and a pair of defeats, the
Club has a much stronger team than '
Lakeside, and will probably give Nor!
Thornton's outfit a closer battle than 1
U.S.C. did.
Hardly back from their transbay j
trip, the Cards will board a train j
Thursday night for Los Angeles, j
where they will play return games i
with the U.C L.A. Bruins and the!
Trojans Friday and Saturday, re- j
spectively. The UJans, who barely |
lost to Stanford, 3 to 2, in a wild
game ten days ago, will rate an even j
chance of revenge over the Indians in !
their home pool.
After Leo Cook had led the Cards j

iu meir easy io 10 <£ win over me j
Trojans Saturday, Coach Fred Cady '
of U.S.C. slated that he regarded the !
Stanford captain as the greatest for
ward in America. When asked if he j
thought Cook was better than Phil'
Daubenspeck, L.A.A.C. ace, Cady re- j
plied, "I'll say so! Why, Cook can j
shoot with a man sitting on his back, 1
and who could ask for more?" The J
Trojan mentor was also high in his |
praise of Taranik, whose swift angle j
shots helped greatly in the over- j
whelming Stanford victory.
The standings now are as follows:
Pacific Coast Conference
Team Won Lost Pet.
Stanford 2 0 1000
U.C.L.A 11 .500
