Two undefeated intramural teams :

clear record—Theta Chi nosed out
Alpha Delta Phi 7 to 6.

0, and Theta Delta Chi was handing
Sigma Nu'll a 6 to 0 defeat.
An expected featui'e of the after

and Delta Upsilon was postponed
until Wednesday.
A brilliant run soon after the kick
off found Bob Forbes standing be
hind the Theta Chi goal line with the i
ball and six points for the Alpha
Delts; but from there on the going
was not so smooth. Conversion
failed after the Alpha Delt score and
late in the second half the plugging
Theta Chi team slipped over a score,
on a pass, John Slusser to Jim Trom
pas.
Bill Hoelle barely drop-kicked
the conversion over the cross-bar
and the score was 7 to 6. Strong
play by the Alpha Delts could not
turn the tide in the final minutes.
Only two quick breaks, executed
by Marvie Kahn and Jim Triolo, dis
tinguished El Toro from their op
ponents, A.K.L. The two teams
fought most of the game to a stand
still; but a sharp thrust for 21 yards
and a touchdown late in the first
half. After his run, Kahn took a pass
from Triolo for the conversion.
Both teams fought on more than
even terms in the second half; Toro
snapped loose for one brief moment
to score, Kahn to Triolo on a long
pass. Kahn booted the conversion
and the final was 14 to 0.
A pass, Karl Simmon to Jack
Pope, in the first half was all that
' separated the Theta Delts from Sig
' ma Nu II in an otherwise even game.
I The pass was good for a touchdown
; and the only points scox-ed in the
game.

clear record—Theta Chi nosed out
Alpha Delta Phi 7 to 6.

A brilliant run soon after the kick
off found Bob Forbes standing be
hind the Theta Chi goal line with the i
ball and six points for the Alpha
Delts; but from there on the going
was not so smooth. Conversion
failed after the Alpha Delt score and
late in the second half the plugging
Theta Chi team slipped over a score,
on a pass, John Slusser to Jim Trom
pas.
Bill Hoelle barely drop-kicked
the conversion over the cross-bar
and the score was 7 to 6. Strong
play by the Alpha Delts could not
turn the tide in the final minutes.
Only two quick breaks, executed
by Marvie Kahn and Jim Triolo, dis
tinguished El Toro from their op
ponents, A.K.L. The two teams
fought most of the game to a stand
still; but a sharp thrust for 21 yards
and a touchdown late in the first
half. After his run, Kahn took a pass
from Triolo for the conversion.
Both teams fought on more than
even terms in the second half; Toro
snapped loose for one brief moment
to score, Kahn to Triolo on a long
pass. Kahn booted the conversion
and the final was 14 to 0.
