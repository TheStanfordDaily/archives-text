# FOURTEEN EASTERN TEAMS CONSIDERED POSSIBLE ENTRIES FOR ROSE BOWL TILT
## 
### PHIL DUFFY 
With Stanford, Washington, and
Santa Clara holding the western
limelight as the only undefeated
teams on the Pacific Coast and the
first two being mentioned for the
Rose Bowl bid, critics are turning l
their eyes eastward in an endeavor
to pick out the possible eastern con-
J tender for the Tournament of Roses
j game.
In the East six teams retain an
! undefeated record with Dartmouth
amassing a total of 135 points in five
games to their opponents none. The
Army and Navy remain undefeated
by their decisive victories of last
' Saturday. Army won over Yale, the
first team to score on the cadets
this season, 20-12, while the Navy
crushed Pennsylvania 17-0. Prince
ton with 169 points to the opposition's I
j 18 in four games, also looms as a
j threat. Syracuse, with only seven
. points against ihcm, have garnered
1 113 digits in four games.
Last, but not least in the eastern
territory, is the fighting Temple
! team coached by Glenn Scobey
1 Warner, former coach of Stanford.
Temple has been tied once, by In

»Diana 6-6, but have scored 141 points
to their opponents' 31 in five games.
Dreams are usually just dreams, but
what a dish of football, it would be
, for western fans if Ten-»ple and Stan
| ford were to meet at the Tourna
[ merit of Roses on New- Year's Day.
The Big Ten race has narrowed
down to four strong contenders, with
Minnesota on the. rail, although
Michigan State has yet to have their
goal line crossed. Illinois and Chi
, cago are the renjfiining two unde
, feated teams and -will not piove set
j ups for anyone.
In the South, Alabama and Tulane,
both of whom liave represented the
J Southern Conference in the Rose
I Bowl, are agaic making strong bids
j for national ho'nors. Louisiana State
land Rice are / also in the southern
| picture, their records marred only by
their own 9-fV tie.
With the /Majority of the stronger
teams in the- East, it appears that the
representative to the Rose Bowl will
again come from this sector. Colum
bia, last year's victor over Stanford,
j started with a bang by beating Yale
i 12-6, but » succumbed to the Navv
ilB-7.
