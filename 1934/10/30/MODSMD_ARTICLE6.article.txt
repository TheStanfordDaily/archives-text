# Russian Chorus to Open Music Series Tonight in Pavilion
## Ex-Officers of Czar's Army Started 36-Voice Choir In Prison Camps 
### Barbara Sweet 
"The Cossacks are coming," a cry
! of terror to the Russian peasant in
the Middle Ages, will be heard once
J more when the A.S.S.U. Concert Se
j ries ushers in its season with the
famous Don Cossacks Russian Male
j Chorus tonight at 8 o'clock in the
I Pavilion.
This a capella choir, composed of
| 3(J ex-officers of the Czar's Imperial J
Regiment, has a history that dates j
: back to the Great War. During the j
I Czarist regime, while fighting on the
i eastern front, these soldiers were
| taken prisoners at the defeat of
; Deniken's troops and sent to the
j prison camp of Tschelengir in Tur
-1 key. Thexe, having faced another
j enemy, the cholera scourge, the sur- i
j viving few banded together into a I
; male chorus.
Among them was a young man of !
; 25, who before the war had been a '
i choir director, and he was chosen to !
| lead the untrained group. Serge
j Jaroff by name, he set to work to
j teach his comrades and mold them
j into a well-balanced singing whole.

Several months later the men were !
transferred to Sofia, upon the consent j
of the Bulgarjan government to ac- j
cept them as part of its quota of j
Russian refugees. Here, working in :
factories, or at whatever they were j
able to do, the men continued their j
singing, eventually forming the choir j
of the Russian Embassy Church.

Leaving Sofia after some time, the j
| Cossacks gave concerts in the va
! rious capitals of Europe anfl finally j
brought their music to America, j
Well-received on their first tour, j
the group has returned at intervals i
and is now making its fifth trip. It .
appeared on the Stanford campus l
three years ago under the auspices |
of the A.S.S.U. Concert Series and |
was so enthusiastically received that j
j Norman Barnes, 1934-35 Concert Se- j
j ries manager, arranged for a return |
i engagement this season.
The program the Cossacks will give
tonight follows their usual custom
of opening with liturgical music, the j
sacred songs of the Russian church,'
then swinging into the melodic folk- j
songs of the peasants, and finally j
ending with the stirring martial mu- ;
sic of the Cossack regiments.
Tickets may still be obtained at j
the Concert Series office and at j
Keeble's in Palo Alto. Those who
have tickets on reserve may get ,
them at the Concert Series office or
] at the box office at the Pavilion to- !
I night.

"The Cossacks are coming," a cry
! of terror to the Russian peasant in
the Middle Ages, will be heard once
J more when the A.S.S.U. Concert Se
j ries ushers in its season with the
famous Don Cossacks Russian Male
j Chorus tonight at 8 o'clock in the
I Pavilion.
This a capella choir, composed of
| 3(J ex-officers of the Czar's Imperial J
Regiment, has a history that dates j
: back to the Great War. During the j
I Czarist regime, while fighting on the
i eastern front, these soldiers were
| taken prisoners at the defeat of
; Deniken's troops and sent to the
j prison camp of Tschelengir in Tur
-1 key. Thexe, having faced another
j enemy, the cholera scourge, the sur- i
j viving few banded together into a I
; male chorus.
Among them was a young man of !
; 25, who before the war had been a '
i choir director, and he was chosen to !
| lead the untrained group. Serge
j Jaroff by name, he set to work to
j teach his comrades and mold them
j into a well-balanced singing whole.

Several months later the men were !
transferred to Sofia, upon the consent j
of the Bulgarjan government to ac- j
cept them as part of its quota of j
Russian refugees. Here, working in :
factories, or at whatever they were j
able to do, the men continued their j
singing, eventually forming the choir j
of the Russian Embassy Church.

Leaving Sofia after some time, the j
| Cossacks gave concerts in the va
! rious capitals of Europe anfl finally j
brought their music to America, j
Well-received on their first tour, j
the group has returned at intervals i
and is now making its fifth trip. It .
appeared on the Stanford campus l
three years ago under the auspices |
of the A.S.S.U. Concert Series and |
was so enthusiastically received that j
j Norman Barnes, 1934-35 Concert Se- j
j ries manager, arranged for a return |
i engagement this season.
The program the Cossacks will give
tonight follows their usual custom
of opening with liturgical music, the j
sacred songs of the Russian church,'
then swinging into the melodic folk- j
songs of the peasants, and finally j
ending with the stirring martial mu- ;
sic of the Cossack regiments.
