# Revision of Drama Used By Timmons
## "One Sunday Afternoon Success on Screen 
### 
For three years James Hagan tried
desperately to sell the New York
stage hit, "One Sunday Afternoon,"
to be produced on the Stanford cam
pus Friday evening.
Producer after producer read the
play and refused it. Hagan at last
made an unimportant alteration of
plot, rcoffered the work, and it was
accepted with enthusiasm. Not until
January of last year did Leo Bul
gakov, well-known Russian, stage
what proved one of the most suc
cessful offerings of the New York
season.
Flash-Back Method
The play, as it was presented on
Broadway, was developed by flash
back method, the prologue and epi
logue being in the present, and the
bulk of the action occurring in 1890.
Hollywood immediately purchased
film right, and starred Gary Cooper.
The movie version was even more
successful than that of the stage, its
box office receipts being far above
average.
William Murray Timmons, dra
matic director,' has chosen the re
vised version of the play for the
Stanford production.
Stanfordite Is Starred
Star of the play in its Broadway
run was Lloyd Nolan, former Stan
ford man and prominent dramatist.
Nolan, after his graduation, received
lucrative roles in several New York
productions, leading up to his as
signment to the role of "Biff Grimes"
in "One Sunday Afternoon."
Dick Frank, dramatic manager,
hoped to present Nolan in the local
production, but learned late yester
day that a personal appearance will
not be possible because of Nolan's
movie contract.
