### 
| Stanford's band will be on hand
, to bolster the Card rooting section
Saturday afternoon in the Los An
! geles Coliseum for the first time in
; the history of Stanford-U.C.L.A.
I rivalry in the South. Word of the
Board of Athletic Control's decision
to finance the musicians' first major
trip of the season was handed down
yesterday by BA.C. Manager Alfred
I Masters.
Bandsmen, some 75 members
| strong, will board the Southern Pa
-1 cific's Sunset Limited Friday eve
j ning at 7:30 for their southern jaunt.
Two special cars have been char-
I tered to accommodate the party, ac
cording to the plans issued by Band
' Manager George Britton.
Arriving in Los Angeles early on
the morning of the game, the band

'by bus, where they will practice
: marching formations in the morning.
It has not yet been decided, accord
i ing to Britton, whether the band
i party will leave immediately after
; the game on Saturday or remain un-
I til Sunday evening. In the event
i that they leave Sunday, the musi-
I cians will be allowed to .sleep in the
1 cars at the railroad station, thus
j saving hotel expenses.

i band director, Drum Major Bill
Okker, Student Director Charlie
j Bubb, and Manager Britton.
All band members planning to ac
! company the organizations this
