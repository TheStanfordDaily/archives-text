0N UNFAILING SENSE OF STYLE HAS
LONG BEEN EVIDENCED IN THE
CLOTHES OF PRINCETON UNDER
GRADUATES AND ALUMNI, AND
HAS MADE ITSELF A NATIONAL FACTOR
IN FASHIONS FOR MEN.
APPAREL ARTS, men's style authority, says:
"Every forward-look ing men's store merchant ought to take a trip
to the Princeton campus. The point of this would be ... some
thing of an intangible nature that goes by the name of fashion."
Princeton men have never approved the bizarre
or the extreme in apparel. Therefore the statement

and specialist in men's wear, is important.

fine tailoring and common
place work is all in the attention given to what some people
call little things. Every detail of a man's clothes is important
to us, that is why we equip the trousers made in our shop with
the Kover-Zip fly. In both style and fit, it is superior to the
buttoned tly and is a big improvement over the ordinary un
covered zipper because the metal is hidden.
Princeton men have endorsed Kover-Zip, the in
visible seamline closure for trousers, as an essential
of correct apparel.
