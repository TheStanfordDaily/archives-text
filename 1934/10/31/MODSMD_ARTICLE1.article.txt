# EX COMMITTEE GRANTS MONEY FOR GAME PYRE
## Block "S" Tennis Awards Restricted to Nine Varsity Letters OKAYS COUNCIL VOTE Group Discusses Plans For Theatre Benefit 
### 
Galloping through a short half
hour meeting with Vicq-President.
Helen Ray holding the gavel, Ex
Committee dispatched business re
stricting the awarding of Block "S"
awards to tennis players, appropriat
ing money for the Big Game Bonfire,
and accepting the results of last
Thursday's Men's Council election
in short order.
Tennis players will find it a good
deal harder to get a Block "S" in the
future under the by-law, which pro
vides that a maximum of nine letters
will be awarded. To get these, a
player must compete in four of the
six conference matches, including
two against California, and players
other than the first ranking four on
the team must win 50 per cent of
their matches. In ca.se of a player's
being forced out because of injury
before completing these require
ments, he may be recommended for
a letter by the coach if he is de
serving.
Reports Given
If the number of conference
matches are changed for any rea
son, the provision makes it necessary
for the player to compete in two
thirds of the matches.
Committee reports from Marvie
Kahn on the New Theatre, and Mort
D'Evelyn on the Music Council were
heard. Kahn's committee is going
forward on plans to solicit funds for
the New Theatre, and Mort D'Eve
lyn on the Music Council were heard.
Kahn's committee is going forward
on plans to solicit funds for the New
Theatre. The plans include the send
ing of a letter to alumni who were
interested in arts during their college
days, and a benefit concert in the
Civic Auditorium in San Francisco.
Action Delayed
Action on the Music Council char
ter was postponed by Ex Committee
until the B.A.C. could give its opinion
on the parts affecting the Band and
Symphony Orchestra.
Minutes of the last meetings of the
Stanford Cardinals and the Rally
Committee were approved. The ap
propriation for the Rally Commit
tee's Big Game Bonfire, which will
take place on the Wednesday before
the Big Game, was not limited to any
definite amount, but the Rally Com
mittee will be restricted to $100 in
making out requisitions for the fire.

As explained in yesterday's Daily,
Helen Ray acted as chairman at the
request of President Kahn, because
Kahn desired her to have the expe
rience of presiding over Ex Com
mittee in the event of his absence in
the future.
