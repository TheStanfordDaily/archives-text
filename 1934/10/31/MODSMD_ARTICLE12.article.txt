# DON COSSACKS THRILL CROWD
## Russian Chorus of 36 Shows Fine Tone, Control 
### 
By Barbara Sweet
Playing upon his perfectly con
trolled chorus of 36 voices as if it
were some delicate musical instru
ment, diminutive Serge Jaroff led
the Don Cossacks to another triumph
last night when they opened the sea
son of the A.S.S.U. Concert Series
in the Pavilion with an impressive
and beautiful performance.
Unaccompanied, the Russian chor
us thrilled the audience with its full,
mellow tone and sonorous depth.
Opening the program with the mys
tic liturgical music of the Greek Or
thodox Church, its minor quality so
representative of the Russian tem
perament, the chorus conveyed the
impression of the shadowy nave and
lighted tapers of a cathedral to per
fection.
Most impressive of the sacred
group was "Have Mercy on Us, O
God!" by Archangelsky, in which this
phrpse was repeated time after time,
the voices rising in crescendo only to
sink again in diminuendo.
The next section of the program
consisted of a selection from Glinka's
opera, "The Life of the Tsar," and
several folk and peasant songs. Out
standing feature of the Glinka num
ber was the wide range of voice it
allowed the chorus to exhibit, the
tenors reaching extraordinary
heights. Amusing was the last of the
peasant songs, a jolly Cossack whis
tling tune ending in a comical, "Ha,
ha, ha."
The remaining part of the program
was devoted to typically melancholy
and lyric Causacian songs, with the
chorus completing the performance
with a wild Russian dance.
