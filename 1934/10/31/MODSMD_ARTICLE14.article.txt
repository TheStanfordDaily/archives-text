DENVER, Oct. 30 (A 3 ).—Police
J bullets, night sticks, and fists today
I tempbrarily broke up an effort of
1300 men and women strike agita
j tors, some of them Communists, to
I disrupt Denver Federal relief work.
With five police injured, one px - ob-
I baly fatally, and with one agitator
I critically injured, 20 others hurt and
j a police car and filling station
| wrecked, the mob after an all-day
effort to halt the relief work finally
talked itself out and dispersed.
One policeman was knocked un
conscious and sprayed with flaming
gasoline when he crashed his car
into a filling station and smashed
two pumps.
Most of the casualties occurred
! during the morning when the mob
descended upon a relief project, at
tempted by force to persuade the
woi'kers to drop their tools and
finally engaged in fierce rioting with
eight police officers. The police fired
j 30 shots over the heads of the crowd
j and one relief worker was wounded
' in the stomach.
j The agitators, complaining against
I the administration of C. D. Shawyer,
j State Federal relief director, and de
| mand recent cuts in relief work
I be restored, were driven from the
j city, but returned peacefully in the
afternoon and were granted per
mission to gather at the Civic Cen
ter, across the street from the State
house.
Fist fights and arguments inter
rupted the program and the police
i finally broke up the meeting when
| the crowd began to show more in
j terest in fights than in the speakers.
The leaders announced they will
j resume their efforts tomorrow.
