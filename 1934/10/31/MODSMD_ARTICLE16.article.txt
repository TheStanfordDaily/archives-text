# Stanford Life Compared With 1834 College Days
## 
### 
If the college student of 1934 could
step back 100 years into the past
and visit an American college of
1834, many strange and amusing
sights would greet his eyes. But
mixed in with the superficial dif
ferences in dress and customs would
be found many factors that would
soon establish a kinship between the
collegian of the present and one of
I he far-distant past.
This visit into the past is strik
ingly brought about by the repro
duction at Union College in New
York, as told in the New York Times,
of a student's room in 1834.
One of the chief differences that a
modern student, especially of Stan
ford, would notice would be the
liquor jug standing on the window
sill. The catch in that arrangement,
however, was that the liquor could
be drunk only in the presence of a
faculty member. Just how this rule
v/as enforced is not made clear. The
student of 1834 was not allowed to
visit taverns in the town but those

| outside its limits are said to have
done a thriving business. Menlo
| isn't such a new idea after aW.
A hundred or more rules, all pun
ishable by fines, made life miserable
for the student of 1834. We don't
\ have so many rules these days but
that word fine has a familiar ring.
Morning ablutions could not be
j performed until the student had
drawn his own water from the well.
Needless to say not much water was
wasted on mere washing. A cupful
was said to have been sufficient.
In place of the once-indispensable
spitoon an ash-tray now graces a
college student's room. In the more
| virile days of 1834, however, stu

bacco leaves.
