# CARDS HOPE TO MAINTAIN PEAK IN U.C.L.A. GAME
## Psychology Believed Right As Indians Go Through Fiery Practice 
### Millard Browne 
A solution to Stanford's current
football problem has been found in a
survey of the Knute Rockne regime
at Notre Dame.
That problem is a psychological
one.
The solution is simple, at least it
sounds that way. Some three yeans
ago "Rock" had a football team that
was on top in the United States. He
didn't fire his players up for each
game, but he reached a peak and
maintained it. Week after week he
met the best teams in the country.
That is the idea now being used,
and effectively it would seem fol
lowing practice last night, with
the Stanford Indians. They will
make no attempt to fire themselves
up for U.C.L.A., but they will keep
going at the pace set last week
next Saturday, and again on No
vember 10 when they meet Wash
ington.
This notion took hold in practice
last night. Every team member went
through practice in a routine, but
fiery manner, and Stanford seemed
ready to take the Bruin game in
stride.
Injuries are still nearly absent
from Thomhill's long list of a coach's
usual worries. Woody Adams, al
though out and hobbling about with
the rest of the squad, still has a bad
ankle that may keep him on the side
lines until the Washington game.
However, he probably will make
the Los Angeles trip Thursday night,
and he may be in shape to play if
needed. Thornhill will announce his
traveling squad following practice
today.
The starting line-up will be un
changed, according to present indica
tions, except for Adams' running
guard berth, which probably will
be turned over to Bob Black. Since
Adams started being the Chili Bcr
toli of the Stanford team, Black has
been given a chance to show his var
sity calibre, and Thornhill hesitates
but little in sending Black in.

The Indians will hold scrimmage
this afternoon, and taper off with a
fairly hard workout tomorrow be
fore entraining for the Southland,
where they will conduct their final
warming-up on Friday.
