# FARM PETITIONS PROTEST ACTION OF BRUIN HEADS
## 
### 
A meeting of students was
called last night in the Wom
en's Clubhouse basement, to
formulate plans of protest
against the action taken against
student leaders at U.C.L.A.
Those present made out a pe
tition as follows:
"We, the undersigned stu
dents of Stanford University,
, protest the summary action of
the administration of U.C.L.A.
in suspending students seeking
to exercise their constitutional
rights to freedom of speech and
assembly."
Petitions will be circulated all
day today, and then sent to Los
Angeles.
