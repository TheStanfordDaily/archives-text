# 1500 TO HEAR LEADERS TALK
## Bartlett, Rowell Will Speak Tonight on Election 
### 
The 1,500-ticket distribution mark
for the Rowell-Bartlett debate on
the California gubrenatorial cam
paign tonight at 7:30 in the Pavilion
was passed by 5 o'clock last night,
indicating the intense interest taken
in the November election by Stan
ford students and faculty.
Professor Edwin A. Cottrell, chair
man of the School of Social Sciences
and executive head of the Depart
ment of Political Science, will pre
side at, the debate.
Although Chester Rowell, editor
of the San Francisco Chronicle, has
campaigned actively in his news
paper columns for the Republican
cause, this is the first time that he
has taken the platform in behalf of
Merriam.
Upton Sinclair's candidacy will be
supported by Louis Bartlett, promi
nent Democrat and San Francisco
lawyer.
The exact question for debate is:
"Should Sinclair or Merriam Be
Governor of California?" Bartlett
will give the first talk of half an
hour. Rowell will follow with the
Republican constructive speech of a
similar time-length. Rebuttals will
follow immediately and will be of 15
minutes' duration each.
Ushers for the Rowell-Bartlett
classic will be Stanford's own de
baters, headed by Manager Robert
Gros. The debate begins promptly at
7:30.
