## 
### 
San Jose State, tail enders in the
intercollegiate soccer league, though
somewhat lacking in ability to win
this season, have come to be known
to Stanford soccermen as harbingers
of injuries. Saturday they added
three more to the Card injury list.

Bud Walker is out of the line-up
with two broken ribs, Steve Enke
suffered a badly sprained ankle and
Dick Forhan sustained a painful jaw
injury. The Cards had the consola
tion of a win, however, as they did in
an early season practice tilt when
the San Jose team cracked up three
other members of the squad to such
an extent that they are not yet back
in the line-up.
