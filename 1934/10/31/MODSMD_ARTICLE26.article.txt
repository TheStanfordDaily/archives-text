# Ucla Provost Calls On Students to Clean Out Active Radical Element
## 3,000 Hold Mass Meeting To Protest Suspension Of Five Agitators RALLY ENDS IN RIOT Participants Throw Campus Cop Over Hedge 
### 
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 30 (A I ).—in
the wake of a mass meeting of up
wards of 3000 students protesting the
suspension of five undergraduates
which ended in riot calls to police,
Provost Ernest C. Moore of the
University of California at Los An
geles today called upon the campus
to "clean house."
Order was restored at the im
promptu mass meeting before police
arrived but not until James Smith,
campus policeman, was tossed over a
hedge after he had pulled down one
of the student speakers.
The five students were suspended,
Dr. Moore said, because they were
fostering radical activities in the
student body against his orders.
Denies Reinstatement
"There will be no immediate re
instatement of the five students who
were suspended from this univer
sity, and no reinstatement will be
forthcoming for several weeks," Dr.
Moore declared.
"This demonstration today will
prove that students should 'clean
house' of the National Student
League.
"The length of suspension of the
five students will depend upon how
long this organization is allowed to
exist on the campus."
The suspended students were:
John Burnside, president of the stu
dent body; Sidney Zsagri, chairman
of the forensic board; Thomas Lam
bert, chairman of the men's board;
Mendel Lieberman, chairman of the
scholarship board; and Celeste
Strack, graduate student.
One student started to harangue
and demand immediate action. He
was pulled down by James Smith,
campus policeman. Other students,
although they assisted in pulling
down the speaker, turned on the po
liceman, tore his uniform and threw
him over a hedge, most of them,
however, acting in a playful man
ner.
Meanwhile someone sent a riot
call to the police at West Los An
geles, a few miles away.
Ends Peacefully
One of the teaching fellows com
manded attention of the assembled
students in explaining that three of
the five suspended students were at
that time in the office of the provost
and that the college administration
would provide exhaustive hearings
of the charges against the suspended
youths of aiding a Communistic-in
spired or revolutionary activity.
Then the students, on an inspira
tion by one whose identity was not
learned, sang the alma mater song
"Hail! Blue and Gold!" that ended
the assembly, in peace.

One student started to harangue
and demand immediate action. He
was pulled down by James Smith,
campus policeman. Other students,
although they assisted in pulling
down the speaker, turned on the po
liceman, tore his uniform and threw
him over a hedge, most of them,
however, acting in a playful man
ner.
Meanwhile someone sent a riot
call to the police at West Los An
geles, a few miles away.
Ends Peacefully
One of the teaching fellows com
manded attention of the assembled
students in explaining that three of
the five suspended students were at
that time in the office of the provost
and that the college administration
would provide exhaustive hearings
of the charges against the suspended
youths of aiding a Communistic-in
spired or revolutionary activity.
Then the students, on an inspira

learned, sang the alma mater song
"Hail! Blue and Gold!" that ended
the assembly, in peace.
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 30 (A I ).—in
the wake of a mass meeting of up
wards of 3000 students protesting the
suspension of five undergraduates
which ended in riot calls to police,
Provost Ernest C. Moore of the
University of California at Los An
geles today called upon the campus
to "clean house."
Order was restored at the im
promptu mass meeting before police
arrived but not until James Smith,
campus policeman, was tossed over a
hedge after he had pulled down one
of the student speakers.
The five students were suspended,
Dr. Moore said, because they were
fostering radical activities in the
student body against his orders.
Denies Reinstatement
"There will be no immediate re
instatement of the five students who
were suspended from this univer
sity, and no reinstatement will be
forthcoming for several weeks," Dr.
Moore declared.
"This demonstration today will
prove that students should 'clean
house' of the National Student
League.
"The length of suspension of the
five students will depend upon how
long this organization is allowed to
exist on the campus."
The suspended students were:
John Burnside, president of the stu
dent body; Sidney Zsagri, chairman
of the forensic board; Thomas Lam
bert, chairman of the men's board;
Mendel Lieberman, chairman of the
scholarship board; and Celeste
Strack, graduate student.
