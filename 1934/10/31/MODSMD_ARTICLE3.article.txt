# Smith Plans Ending Hop In Oakland
## Flier Ready To Leave Hawaii Tomorrow 
### 
HONOLULU, Oct. 30 (/P).â€”Eager
ly awaiting the clearing of storms,
Sir Charels Kingsford-Smith and
Captain P. G. Taylor hope to take
off Thursday afternoon for Oakland,
Calif., to complete their tremendous
flight of 7365 miles over ttye Pacific
from Brisbane, Australfa, via Suva
and Honolulu.
Clad in fresh flannels, white shirts
and sport shoes, the two aviators
looked fit enough to fly around the
earth despite their perilous journey
through heavy rainstorms yesterday
from the Fiji islands, 3197 miles.
Inspcct Plane
They were up at dawn, ate a
hearty breakfast and came down
town to call on army and navy offi
cers and have a good look at their
plane, Lady Southei-n Cross. The
latter's skirts were somewhat soiled
by an unintended bath in salt water
at Naselai Beach, Fiji, last week,
when the heavily loaded plane
slewed from the sand runway.
In going to Oakland, Sir Charles
will respond to a sentimental urge
to land jit the same field from which
he and three others took off in the
old Southern Cross in June, 1928,
on the epochal flight to Sydney,
Australia. He will also be perform
ing the role of a dutiful son. The
last thing his mother, who is 77
years old, told him was:
"Now, Chilla, you go straight to
Oakland and see Harold. Give him
my love. I haven't seen that boy
in 25 years."
Harold, who is connected with the
American - Hawaiian Steamship
Company, is 55, and Sir Charles' old
est brother.
Many Invitations
"I have been besieged with invita
tions from Los Angeles to fly directly
there, but I am sorry I cannot ac
cept them," the famous flyer said.
"For one thing, Oakland is the place
where I started the other transpacific
flight. Besides it is one hour shorter,
and that is not a thing to be lightly
considered."
"It must be a relief from mental
strain to know the worst part of
the trip is over," remarked the Asso
ciated Press correspondent.
"That must be ihe reason I feel so
awfully good today," he replied,
smiling.
He passed off the 2400-mile flight
to Oakland, never before attempted
east-bound, as a thing assured.
