# Once and for All, Let's Wash Our Hands

Too many metropolitan newspapers* have
misquoted the Daily as having advocated that
;iI hides he paid an outright salary lor their
services to dear old Alma Mammy. Therefore
the following, an expression of what the Daily
docs believe.
* * *
That the present situation, in which it is
considered an annual event for one institution
to hurl charges of proselyting at the other, is
undesirable and unnecessary.
That athletes in need of assistance, and
whose scholastic standing is at least a "B
minus" in the university, with the possible
exception of a average during the period
<it actual athletic competition, should he aided
with either tuition, hoard, or room scholar
ships in respect to the degree of need shown.
That athletes at no time or place should
ever he paid a salary for their efforts on the
gridiron. If thev cannot all'ord to remain in
school without financial assistance, they
should, where possible, he granted the above
mentioned scholar ships where their scholastic
record is satisfactory.
That this action on the part of any uni
versity should in no way curtail the aid that
is at present being tendered other needy stu
dents, every bit :is deserving, who are not par
ticipating in athletics.
That, wherever possible, athletes should
be given the chance to earn their board and
room if I hey really heed the money, rather
than he given a blanket scholarship.
That the only reason for taking care of
athletes in this manner lies in the fact that
four hours daily, in addition to time required
by scholastic work, is consumed in strenuous,
back-breaking workouts that practice in any
sport demands. Four hours or more that
might have been spent at some job that would
have paid for room and hoard. That is xvhv
the athlete believes he should be helped at
times. If he weren't playing the game, he
could I>c earning his own needs elsewhere.

Tlu' Daily oilers the above in the hope I hat
some influential member of the Pacific Coast
Conference will undertake to ask that body to
do something along these lines, making il un
necessary for yearly squabbles over the same
old question.
There is no reason for any of lis to throw
mud at the other fellow, and if we all knew
what the rest were doing, coaches, alumni,
and students would be much happier.
