# "No Smoking Allowed"
## 
### 
- Old traditions are very much like the pro
verbial black penny turning up to annoy us
:it any odd moment; but Stanford does have
;i tradition which we like to look upon with
pride and approbation. Stanford students do
not smoke on their Quad.
There is nothing sacred, nor particularly
inspiring, about the idea. II is merely a rellec
tion of good sense and courtesy. For the
edification of the pragmatic, it reduces the
eosl of fire insurance; and for the aesthetes,
il improves and enhances the appearance of
the Quad and grounds.
The Executive Committee hopes to embark
on a campaign against violation of Ibis tra
dition; and as such ;i cause is ;i laudable one,
the Daily congratulates the Executive Com
mittee. IJut no campaign will be effective ex
cept as the students, man to man and gal lo
gal, make sure that the tradition is worthy
:md one that ought to be retained.
