# U.C.L.A. Hodgepodge

### 
As the mess and turmoil at the University
of California at Los Angeles resolves itself
into a clearer picture and we are privileged
lo hear the causes prompting the recent dis
missal of five students, we can only reiterate
our belief thai freedom of speech and thought
no longer exist on I he southern campus.
According to press reports (and I he para
gra I'll is buried down al the end of the story)
the live students were charged with ignoring

the wishes of President Sproul of the I'ni
versitv of (lalilornia, who did not desire them
Id hold ;i eatnpns forum on the state eleetion.
They were alleged to hjive held ;i meeting and
diseussed the forum.
This II a grant violation of the estimahle Mr.
Sprout's precept \v:is eonstrued "iis using stu
dent offices to aid the National Student League,
a Communist organization, to destroy the uni
versity."
It is stupefying, to say the least, to find that
arguing the relative merits of Republican-
Conservative Frank Merriam and Deinocratic-
Socialist Upton Sinclair, is subversive, blaek
handed, revolutionism-, bomb-throwing, Mos
eovian, red llag waving, and all that sort of
thing. If it be, we are all Communists, all
probably guilty of criminal syndicalism, and
aiming at the ultimate destruction of the
University of California and all its branches.
Do the administrators of our state colleges
lake their students for supine asses? What are
they trying to turn out as graduates—gentle
men and intelligent citizens, or plain nincom
poops? While all the rest of the sovereign
State of California is allame with the keenest
political contest in its history, are the students
of U.C.L.A. to practice argumentative celi
bacy? From all we read, this is the implica
tion, and if it be true, it must be a strange
brand of boobies they are inducting into the
sacred realm of learning down at West wood.
Hut yesterday two thousand students on
that campus asserted what we believe is every
man and woman's right, and in effect told the
administration to go to hell, by demanding
reinstatement of their comrades. Of course,
if merely I lie students demand, they can do
so and be hanged, before the provincial offi
cials of the university will give up their unde
niable right of dismissing whom they please.
The good doctors of the university are
going to give the culprits another hearing, in
a conference with their parents. It is hoped
that the parents will exercise sufficient intelli
gence and courage to demand that their off
spring be bred to some better fate than that
of "yes men" and that they have the perspi
cuity to penetrate this veil of "Communism"
which, as best we can understand it, seems
to be of the mild and pinkish or baloney sort.

probably guilty of criminal syndicalism, and
aiming at the ultimate destruction of the
University of California and all its branches.
Do the administrators of our state colleges
lake their students for supine asses? What are
they trying to turn out as graduates—gentle
men and intelligent citizens, or plain nincom
poops? While all the rest of the sovereign
State of California is allame with the keenest
political contest in its history, are the students
of U.C.L.A. to practice argumentative celi
bacy? From all we read, this is the implica
tion, and if it be true, it must be a strange
brand of boobies they are inducting into the
sacred realm of learning down at West wood.
Hut yesterday two thousand students on
that campus asserted what we believe is every
man and woman's right, and in effect told the
administration to go to hell, by demanding
reinstatement of their comrades. Of course,
if merely I lie students demand, they can do
so and be hanged, before the provincial offi
cials of the university will give up their unde
niable right of dismissing whom they please.
The good doctors of the university are
going to give the culprits another hearing, in
a conference with their parents. It is hoped
that the parents will exercise sufficient intelli
gence and courage to demand that their off
spring be bred to some better fate than that
of "yes men" and that they have the perspi
cuity to penetrate this veil of "Communism"
which, as best we can understand it, seems
to be of the mild and pinkish or baloney sort.
As the mess and turmoil at the University
of California at Los Angeles resolves itself
into a clearer picture and we are privileged
lo hear the causes prompting the recent dis
missal of five students, we can only reiterate
our belief thai freedom of speech and thought
no longer exist on I he southern campus.
According to press reports (and I he para
gra I'll is buried down al the end of the story)
the live students were charged with ignoring

the wishes of President Sproul of the I'ni
versitv of (lalilornia, who did not desire them
Id hold ;i eatnpns forum on the state eleetion.

This II a grant violation of the estimahle Mr.
Sprout's precept \v:is eonstrued "iis using stu

a Communist organization, to destroy the uni
versity."
It is stupefying, to say the least, to find that
arguing the relative merits of Republican-
Conservative Frank Merriam and Deinocratic-
Socialist Upton Sinclair, is subversive, blaek
handed, revolutionism-, bomb-throwing, Mos
eovian, red llag waving, and all that sort of
thing. If it be, we are all Communists, all
probably guilty of criminal syndicalism, and
