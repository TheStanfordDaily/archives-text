# Dr. Butler Is Shocked!
## 
### 
Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler deplores the
manners and personal conduct of the youth of
today, he staled at the opening exercises of
Columbia University last week. "In respect to
manners and personal conduct, present-day
habits as manifested in every sort of public
place and personal relationship arc time and
again quite shocking. One wonders why it is
that youth can come to full adolescent years
with no apparent appreciation between good
manners and their opposite."
0.K.. Dr. Butler, we accept your verdict.
Our manners are terrible. We don't always
stand when you enter the room; we smoke
in the street; we keep our fought-for places
in street ear and subway, though the aged and
female stand in the aisle. On the other count,
100, we plead guilty. Our personal conduct,
judged by the standards of your youth, is
shocking. Well, we changed the standards.
We had to. Yours didn't lit.
When you're thinking about modern youth,
Dr. Butler, and before you talk about us —ask
yourself some questions. When has a genera
tion found its world more topsy-turvy, its
future more uncertain, its "today" more com
plex? When has youth faced life with more
sincerity, courage, and intelligence?
When you have the answers, tell us. We'll
go to them for guidance.—Syracuse Daily Or
