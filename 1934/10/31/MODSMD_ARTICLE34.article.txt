Proposed legislation to place the Federal Reserve
System under direct supervision of the Treasury is
being drafted for submission to Congress in January,
according to newspaper correspondents at the capital.
Professor of Finance George Dowrie says the idea of a
change is mere newspaper gossip.
"President Roosevelt has not given the least inkling
of wanting to change the Federal Reserve."
Dowrie agrees with the Treasury experts that a
more unified banking system would greatly facilitate
the efficiency of the Federal Reserve but does not be
lieve that the change should be made now.
"I'd rather not see the national banking system come
up for change until the government is in a more settled
condition," he said.
Under the present system there are 12 regional banks
supervised by a central board. Other countries have
only one. Reason for the United States arrangement is
the large size of the nation and that people are afraid
of too much concentration of money.
"To my mind it was a mistake to establish the Fed
eral Reserve with 12 banks, as 12 can't do as good a
job as one. I think we should have one bank, but 1
don't believe it should be a part of the government. It is
too tempting for the government to use the easy
money," he explained.
The new plan is to have the Reserve Banks closely
affiliated with the Treasury. The professor does not
consider it fair to the individual banks to have them
dominated to that extent. He does favor .some kind of
regulation, however.
"I'd like to see one central bank at New York, run
by bankers under government supervision, but not
government domination," the finance authority said.
There is so much pressure on the government now
that it is a dangerous time to establish a central bank.
The government is trying to handle plans at present
that require huge sums of money. To put the treasury
money under the same jurisdiction as the banks might
lead to dangerous credit programs and over-indulgence
in spending.
Explaining the reaction of bankers to the current
movement, Dowrie said: "Bankers are great worship
pers of things as they are."
"They were even opposed to the Federal Reserve
System when it was first started, just because credit
control was a new thing. Stabilizing credit is going
bo increasingly important. There is going to be more
stress put on it in all countries," the professor predicts.
