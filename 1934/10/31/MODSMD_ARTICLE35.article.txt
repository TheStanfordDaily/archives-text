"FIGHTING BRUIN BKAR"
U.C.L.A. Isa-peculiar school. It is
situated on some dusty hills not far
from the ocean, and Southern Cali
fornians like to think that its campus
will one day rival the Farm. It has
a definite inferiority complex from!
long years of being. referred to as I
"the Southern Branch," and tries to
heal that ache by lusty Wednesday j
morning sings—a tradition about as
virile as the "hello" custom.
Well might U.C.L.A. blush at a sad
case of miscegenation lurking in its j
family closet. It was'fathered by an '
intelligent and outspoken liberal— 1
Josiah Royce, and mothered by the I
Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce !
—which probably explains any,
strange or queer happenings.on the'
southern campus.
U.C.L.A. officialdom—like all of- !
ficialdoms—has some very odd mem
bers. None more grotesque than one j
of the very highest, who freely ad- j
mits that he does not read the daily !
newspapers.
The highest U.C.L.A. official has j
just expelled from the University !
five students — trusted in student i
councils—for the crime of meeting !
to consider holding a political forum !
banned by the administration. The
five students were expelled for
"countenancing" the National Stu
dent League, pinkish crusader j
against compulsory military service i
and suppression of academic free- i
dom.
i
To be true to the ideals of the pro- 1
fession which seeks the truth, Dr.
Moore is honor-bound to resign his
position before he yields to the po- j
litical pressure that is squelching i
freedom of speech and assembly in
California state universities. Aside
from the purely intellectual and i
Constitutional right to freedom of
expression, it is a bit difficult to 1
understand how U.C.L-A. can crack
down on opinions that happen to
oppose the administration; a state
university is supported by compul
sory taxation. And the tax collector
does not ask if a man "believes" or
does not "believp,"
If U.C.L.A. students value their :
freedom of thought and expression,
they will walk out in protest at their '
administration's unjust action. Stan- j
ford students today are circulating a j
petition of sympathetic protest, that
may be forwarded to the City of the !
Lost Angels and . the University of
the surly Bruin.
