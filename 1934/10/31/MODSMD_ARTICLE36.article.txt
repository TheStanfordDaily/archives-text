The Editor, Sir:
Congratulations on your new series
of articles on Sinclair. There is, j
i however, in your "interesting and I
| true" information one statement that, !
while it is certainly interesting, is
j very far from the truth.
I refer to the paragraph about
I "reds, communists, and socialists"
which concludes with the sentence:
J "Still they support Sinclair to a
t man." Any reader of the press of
the radical parties # knows what an
ignorant mis-statement that is.
The socialist party, in their "New
j Leader," compares Sinclair and
I Mussolini as "renegades" to the cause
lof radicalism. At the Milen
I Dempster, their candidate for gov
! ernor in California, concedes that
| EPIC could possibly be a success
! ful system of unemployment relief.
! Full page articles in their press call
■ EPIC a "quack remedy" that "seeks
| to offer the unemployed a half in
i stead of a full loaf." Their carica
i tures of Uppie "tilting at windmills"
1 are even better than Argon's "bird
! of paradise" in the Chronicle.
As to the Communists, when they {
are not jailed by San Francisco fas
cist police on "$lOOO vag." charges, |
they spend their time wampaigning i
| against "Sinclair, the social-fascist, j
j A typical title for one of their soap- i
! box orations is "Exploding the EPIC ;
i Myth."
j ' Sincc Mr. Bungs is writing his !
1 comments on the California election
from the far-removed observatory of
Harvard, I guess he has based his
j charge that the radical parties are
I supporting Sinclair from the non
sense that has appeared in the Hearst
scandal sheets, those typical ex
amples of honest American journal
ism. For that reason we can pardon
him. Bill Millis
The Editor, Sir:
In regard to the editorial concern
ing the five ousted U.C.L.A. students,
can it be that Stanford is to join that
group of universities which have
, expressed Communistic tendencies?
' We hope not.
This reader is aware of the fact
; that Stanford has always been very
democratic, but this should be no
j excuse for being un-American,
i Certainly Communism is un-Amer- i
ican. The editor seemed to have dif
ficulty in deciding which side to de
fend. He denies favoring Commune
i ism but still believes that the sup
pression of it "enables the martyr to ,

thrive."
Well, Stanford, whither way? Shall
it be radicalism or conservatism? !
Perhaps The Daily can light the way j
for us.

The Editor, Sir:
Congratulations on your new series
of articles on Sinclair. There is, j
i however, in your "interesting and I
| true" information one statement that, !
while it is certainly interesting, is
j very far from the truth.
I refer to the paragraph about
I "reds, communists, and socialists"
which concludes with the sentence:
J "Still they support Sinclair to a
t man." Any reader of the press of
the radical parties # knows what an
ignorant mis-statement that is.
The socialist party, in their "New
j Leader," compares Sinclair and
I Mussolini as "renegades" to the cause
lof radicalism. At the Milen
I Dempster, their candidate for gov
! ernor in California, concedes that
| EPIC could possibly be a success
! ful system of unemployment relief.
! Full page articles in their press call
■ EPIC a "quack remedy" that "seeks
| to offer the unemployed a half in
i stead of a full loaf." Their carica
i tures of Uppie "tilting at windmills"
1 are even better than Argon's "bird
! of paradise" in the Chronicle.
As to the Communists, when they {
are not jailed by San Francisco fas
cist police on "$lOOO vag." charges, |
they spend their time wampaigning i
| against "Sinclair, the social-fascist, j
j A typical title for one of their soap- i

i Myth."

1 comments on the California election
from the far-removed observatory of
Harvard, I guess he has based his
j charge that the radical parties are
I supporting Sinclair from the non
sense that has appeared in the Hearst
scandal sheets, those typical ex
amples of honest American journal
ism. For that reason we can pardon
him. Bill Millis
The Editor, Sir:
In regard to the editorial concern
ing the five ousted U.C.L.A. students,
can it be that Stanford is to join that
group of universities which have
, expressed Communistic tendencies?
' We hope not.
This reader is aware of the fact
; that Stanford has always been very
democratic, but this should be no
