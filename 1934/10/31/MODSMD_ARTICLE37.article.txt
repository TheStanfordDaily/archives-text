THE LADY FROM TDK SEA

(Review Editor's Note: "Lady
from the Sea" will be presented this
j evening at the Palo Alio Com -1
| munity Theatre with an all-star'
[ Stanford cast.)
Henrik Ibsen's drama, The Lady
from the Sea is a product of what
i may be called Ibsen's "late middle i
j period." Written long after the first i
heavy experimental plays (Peer
Gynt, Emperor and Galilean, etc.) it
blends his realistic method as used
in such a play as The Enemy of the [
People with the obscurism of his
later symbolic dramas.
And the combination is a happy I
' one. The play moves swiftly into the I
dilemma of Ellida and her under- |
standing husband and rises to a mo- j
ment of intense suspense as Ellida, |
given her freedom, makes her deci
sion not to follow the Stranger.
As in all of Ibsen's plays. The Lady
from the Sea presents with uncom- i
promising force, a "problem," but !
states it in a dramatic rather than a
rhetorical form. Most of the modern
dramatists - with - a - purpose could
learn a great deal about the nature
j of their medium from this master as
a view of such a crudely made i
j propaganda play as Stevedore dem
i onstrates. Ibsen, in his least con- I
| temporary plays, always affords an ;
! absorbing and challenging evening
; in the theatre; the moderns too fre- j
| quently limit themselves to preju- j
J dice where Ibsen's view is rational, j
Even so slick a craftsman as Elmer j
Rice showed this shortcoming in j
Judgment Day, current on Broad- !
I way. Ibsen, after all, is the master j
! as well as the father, of the contro- j
i versial drama as it stands today. I
And it is always a thrilling pleasure
to see his sturdy and vital plays in >
