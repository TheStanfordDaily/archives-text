# Team Helps On Play Set
## 
### 
A generous dentist, a decrepit
Ford truck, and a large part of the
Stanford football team are partly
responsible for the success of "One
Sunday Afternoon," to be viewed by
campus theatre-goers Friday eve
ning.
One set called for a dentist's chair,
an article not found in abundance in
local classrooms. Stage directors
pondered, finally applying to a Palo
Alto dentist for aid.
He offered his equipment, which
was, unfortunately, securely bolted
to the floor. It was unscrewed, lifted
with great difficulty to a somewhat
rickety truck, and brought in state
to the stage door by numerous mem
bers of the football squad, who
hoisted it to the stage and departed,
exhausted but pleased.
Tickets are still available at the
A.S.S.U. office in the Old Union, at
the customary prices of 50 and 75
cents, and $1.
