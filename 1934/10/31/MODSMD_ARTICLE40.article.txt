# VARSITY, YEARLING HOOP TEAMS WILL CLASH IN PAVILION
## Basketball Fives Prepare For Semi-Annual Tilt On November 8 
### 
Basketball fans will be given i
real treat on Thursday, November 8
at 4 o'clock in the Pavilion wher
the Stanford varsity tangles with its
little brothers, the Stanford frosl
team, in a full time, regular officiatec
game. Score will be kept and eael
team will probably have a rooting
section to cheer it on to a victory.
Each year two such games arc
held. One game comes before
Coaches John Bunn and Jimmj
Bradshaw have taken over theii
charges, and the other is played al
Ihe end of the regular basketball
season. Last year the varsity won
the first game by a close margin, and
the frosh came back to win the
second game, also by a narrow
margin.
Coach Boosts Teams
Chuck Glasgow, now in charge of
basketball practice, says; "This year's
teams are better than last year's."
S<; it wuuld seem that rooters are in
for an enjoyable afternoon.
The varsity men will be particu
larly eager to win this initial game,
as the barnstorming tour of the East
comes in little over a month from
now, and as yet the traveling squad
has not been picked. Naturally the
frosh would relish the chance to give
the regulars a beating and have a
good chance of doing so as they sur
pass the varsity in height, although
they lack experience.
Holds Basic Drill
The varsity team is busy working
on basic plays, and its slow and fast
breaks, with a touch of its regular
five-man zone defense thrown in,
From these basic -plays the team
originates its set plays to be used in
competition.
Squads have not been picked foi
either the frosh or varsity teams, but
the following have been showing up
well in practice.
Varsity: forwards: Turner, Ander
son, Cowing, Quade, Bost, and Man
nion; centers: Gorter, Smith, Nobs,
and Allen; guards: Moore, Lindsey,
Malatratt, Page, Spears, and Lour
deaux.
Frosh: Zonne, Luisetti, Lyons, Lee,
Hulbert, Bigler, Hara, MacTavish,
Maurer, and Felberbaum.
