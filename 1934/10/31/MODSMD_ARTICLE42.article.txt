Defaults, which have marred oth
i erwise intense play in Intramural
j touch football this season, cropped
up again yesterday to mar slightly a
day of intense activity at the frosh
I fields. Sigma Chi's thrilling over
j time ti to 0 victory against the Break
ers, and Phi Sigma Kappa's upset of
a strong Beta team gave a good qual
ity to the games that were played.
Robert Wardwell was the Phi
Sig's big gun in their 20 to 6 victory
over the Betas. With the game only
| four minutes old he toted the ball
over the Beta's goal line from a
short way out to climax a strong
thrive. A pass to George Worley
added the conversion. Frank Inger
! soil countered for the Betas with
| a nice run for a score. The conver-
I sion failing, the score stood 7 to 6.
Then on passes, Wardwell to
Worley and Peter Mondavi, the Phi
Sigs drew away, finishing their scor
! ing by a pass from Wardwell to
Griffin for a conversion and the 20th
point.
Pass Wins Game
No less a battle after a ding-dong
' 40 minutes in which both Sigma Chi
! and the Breakers appeared to have
I fought themselves out, was the over
! time period to settle the game.
Alternating on 10 consecutive
i plays, Sigma Chi was at the com.-
I pletion of its fourth and next to last
| play, 40 yards into Breaker territory.
; A desperate pass, Art Allen to Har
lan Carter, ate up these 40 yards at
j one thrust, placing the ball one yard
j into the Sigma Chi end of the field
with one play left.
John Brock faded back and let fly
! a pass, which Willard Buscher gath-
I ered in on a running catch 20 yards
! down field to pocket the game for
| Sigma Chi.
Penalize Defaulters
In fairness to intramural teams,
I GifT Myers, assistant intramural
' manager, wishes to inform them that
J defaulting teams lose their entry
j points in the sport, not merely the
, particular victory which they de
; fault.
First returns from the golf tourna
| ment indicate that the Forgers have
j beaten the Encina Hashers, and
! Sigma Chi has turned back Kappa
i Sigma. Other competitors have un
til Friday to complete the first round
matches, according to Marvie Kahn,
intramural manager.
