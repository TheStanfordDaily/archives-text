# WATER POLOISTS PLAY ATHENS IN OAKLAND TONIGHT
## Cards Prepare for Bruin, Trojan Contests 
### 
Playing the first of three games'
this week, Stanford's varsity water 1
polo team travels to Oakland tonight (
to meet the Athens Club at 8:30
o'clock. The Winged Acorns have a
Northern California Water Polo
League team of about average
strength, having lost to California :
and the Olympic Club, but holding
two victories over Lakeside.
The clubmen will know Nort 1
Thornton's system, because Ogden
"Denny" Driggs, their star guard, [
and defensive mainstay, is a former |
Stanford swimming captain. They !
also have two top-notch forwards in j
Peterson and McKay, the latter a j
California star of several years ago. '
The great Cardinal forward com
bination of Captain Leo Cook and j
Vlad Taranik intends to use the j
game with the Athenians both as a
means of fattening their scoring rec
ord and as a good work-out for the j
week-end games with the Bruins
and Trojans in Los Angeles. With !
such expert mates as Bob Foster and
Bill Clemo, forwards; Bill Woodard, i
Wally Wiget, and Jimmy Benet,!
guards; and Jack Haslacher, goalie,;
helping them, the huge leader and
the "Red Raider" should defeat the 1
clubmen without too much trouble
