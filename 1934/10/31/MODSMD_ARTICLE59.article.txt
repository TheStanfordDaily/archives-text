# "BEST-DRESSED" MEN AT BIG COLLEGES COMMEND KOVER-ZIP
## 
### 
American college men have a sure instinct
for improvements in apparel that add to t ho
smartness of the things they wear. A typical
instance of this style-sense was the nation
wide approval of the Kover-Zip fly by
"best-dressed" seniors at the great univer
sities from coast to coast. Here are some of
many comments on this invisible seamline
closure by college men who were selected
as "best-dressed":

t. n. iiisutt
Princeton, 1934
"The covered zipper
Jly is neatness and per
fection for trousers and
slacks — quite an im
provement over the or
dinary zipper with its
unsightly strip of raw
hardware."

Monroe B. Hel linger
Cornell, 1934
"The usual slide fas
tener with its strip of
exposed hardware just
doesn't belong on Rood
clothes. The covered
zipper is the last word
in a modern closure for
the fly; no metal showB."

Albert E. Newman
Michigan, 1934 ®
"The flashy metal of
the uncovered slide fas
tener did make you
flinch, but this new
covered zipper is neat as
a seamline. Write me
down as voting for the
covered zip."

John A. Hooley
Yale, 1034
"I've never seen *
fly-fastening device of
any kind that compares
with the Kover-Zip—
good taste would rule
out the uncovered slide
fastener with its strip
of exposed metal."
