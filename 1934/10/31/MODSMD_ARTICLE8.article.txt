# Theater Committee Asks Suggestions On Structure Plans
## $356,983 Deficit Present Stumbling Block To Early Completion 
### Annalee Whitmore 
Student enthusiasm initiated the
plan of a complete, up-to-date cam
pus theatre.
Student funds will be mainly re
sponsible for its construction.
Opinions of the student group will
be considered in its final election,
decided the Theatre Committee yes
terday.
Suggestions relating to all phases
of the structure are invited, they
announce. They may be left, writ
ten, in room 2038 or mailed to the
University. Every contribution,
whether relating to heating system or
placing of box office, will be cata
logued, considered, and perhaps in
corporated in final blueprints.
Troubles Mapped
Yesterday's session took the the
atre several strides further along the
i-oad to completion. A definite pro
gram to solve financial difficulties
is being mapped out, under the
guidance of Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur
and Almon E. Roth, president and
comptroller of the University, and
students heads Marvie Kahn, Helen
Ray, Stan Beaubaire, Gordon Steed
man, and Norman Barnes.
The situation to date:
Amount available includes the
Theatre Fund, which had its incep
tion in a Chaparral-organized drive
for contributions, and the War Me
morial Fund, which may be utilized
because of incorporation of a Me
morial Court and tower.
The former totals $4,761.71, the lat
ter $162,555.25.
Cost Half Million
Plans, as drawn up by university
architects and approved as a whole
by an overwhelming vote of Ex
Committee, place cost at $524,300.
This may be increased by an addi
tional $40,000, if the seating capacity
is raised from 1000 to 1250.
Plans are approved, except for
trifling changes; architects have done
an unusual piece of work; the the
atre itself is undoubtedly necessary;
but the unavoidable $356,983.04 defi
cit is proving a temporary stumbling
block.
20 Years To Pay
Comptroller Roth pointed out in a
previous Daily article that if the dol
lar per quarter which the students
so willingly assessed themselves last
year is supplemented by an addi
tional dollar per student per quarter,
with perhaps $5000 each year from
the Board of Athletic Control, a pe
riod of almost 20 years will still be
necessary to clear up debt on the
project.
That is the problem faced by the
recently-formed Theatre group. A
solution may be reached in the near
future, several ingenious ideas now
being under consideration. President
Marvie Kahn requests student co
operation, and again invites sugges
tions relating to the structure.

future, several ingenious ideas now
being under consideration. President
Marvie Kahn requests student co
operation, and again invites sugges
tions relating to the structure.
Student enthusiasm initiated the
plan of a complete, up-to-date cam
pus theatre.
Student funds will be mainly re
sponsible for its construction.
Opinions of the student group will
be considered in its final election,
decided the Theatre Committee yes
terday.
Suggestions relating to all phases
of the structure are invited, they
announce. They may be left, writ
ten, in room 2038 or mailed to the
University. Every contribution,
whether relating to heating system or
placing of box office, will be cata
logued, considered, and perhaps in
corporated in final blueprints.
Troubles Mapped
Yesterday's session took the the
atre several strides further along the
i-oad to completion. A definite pro
gram to solve financial difficulties
is being mapped out, under the
guidance of Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur
and Almon E. Roth, president and
comptroller of the University, and
students heads Marvie Kahn, Helen
Ray, Stan Beaubaire, Gordon Steed
man, and Norman Barnes.
The situation to date:
Amount available includes the
Theatre Fund, which had its incep
tion in a Chaparral-organized drive
for contributions, and the War Me
morial Fund, which may be utilized
because of incorporation of a Me
morial Court and tower.
The former totals $4,761.71, the lat
ter $162,555.25.
Cost Half Million
Plans, as drawn up by university
architects and approved as a whole
by an overwhelming vote of Ex
Committee, place cost at $524,300.
This may be increased by an addi
tional $40,000, if the seating capacity
is raised from 1000 to 1250.
Plans are approved, except for
trifling changes; architects have done
an unusual piece of work; the the
atre itself is undoubtedly necessary;
but the unavoidable $356,983.04 defi
cit is proving a temporary stumbling
block.
20 Years To Pay
Comptroller Roth pointed out in a
previous Daily article that if the dol
lar per quarter which the students
so willingly assessed themselves last
year is supplemented by an addi
tional dollar per student per quarter,
with perhaps $5000 each year from
the Board of Athletic Control, a pe
riod of almost 20 years will still be
necessary to clear up debt on the
project.
That is the problem faced by the
recently-formed Theatre group. A
solution may be reached in the near
future, several ingenious ideas now
being under consideration. President
Marvie Kahn requests student co
