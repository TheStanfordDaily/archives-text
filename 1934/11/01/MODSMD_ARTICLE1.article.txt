### 
BERKELEY, Oct. 31 (A 1 ),- A ma
jority of a mass meeting of LiOO Uni
versity of California students voted
today 1o strike at orn future date"
if suspension proceedings instituted
against five students at the University
of California at Los Angt-lcs were
not rescinded.
Israel Shapiro, recent U.C.L.A.
transfer to Berkeley, asked how
many <>f his listeners would go on
a one-hour protest strike. A large
number of those present raised
their liandfj. They decided to await
"further developments" before car-

rying out their threat.
A telegram was adopted for dis
patch to Provost Ernest C. Moore of
U.C.L.A., saying:
Protest Suspension
"We, 300 students of the Univer
sity of California asse.mb.lpd in mass
meeting, protest suspension of the
five U.C.L.A. students as violation of
the rights of student self-government
and academic freedom which implies
free speech and free assembly, and
we demand their immediate and un
conditional reinstatement."
Moore said the agitation resolved
into the question of who was run
ning the university.
He defended his suspensions with
the assertion that his campus was a
"hotbed of Communism," and added
that it was a question of "whether
the constituted authorities should run
the university or whether we should
turn it over to the control of an
unorganized group of Communists."
Loud Self-Government
The mass meeting at Berkeley
hooted his stand as against the right
of student self-government! They
threatened to smash the camera of a
photographer who said he had been
hired by the university buildings and
grounds department to take pictures
of the gathering.
The photographer was released un
disturbed after cooler heads argued
against violence.
The Daily Ca'ifornian, questioned
whether "any five studenls in any
university could have power and in
fluence to 'use their offices to destroy
the university by handing it over to
the Communists.' "
"...If that condition actually pre
vails at U.C.L.A.â€”well, it must be
an awfully queer campus."
