Behind prison walls three Stan
i ford debaters will go next Sunday
i when they venture into San Quen-
I tin to debate against that prison's
| choicest orators.
Representatives of the Farm this
; year will be Dave Mellinkoff and
! Bob Grander, seniors, and Ed Janss,
1 sophomore. They will uphold the
! affirmative side of the question, "Re-
I solved: that the several states adopt
I a system of compulsory health in
surance."
i This debate will'be the fourth of
j what promises to be a classic series
jin Stanford forensic history. Two
I were held last year, and one the year
j before, Stanford winning decisions in
I the first two debates and dropping
| the third to the loquacious convicts.
