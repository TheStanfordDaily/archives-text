# SINCLAIR: THE MAN
## 
### CROMPTON BANGS, Jr 
Tuesday we saw how Upton Sin
! clair put together a coalition the like
| of which the nation has never seen
before. It was this following that
gave him victory in the primaries;
on them he is depending mainly for
(he million and a half votes he will
I need next Tuesday.
But the biggest mystery of it all 1
; is how he managed to enlist such
j contrasting elements to work in such
j apparent harmony during the sum
! mer months. Many of Sinclair's ad- ;
I hcrents have no more political kin
| ship to him than they have to Ogden J
Mills. The answer lo this question is
j found in Democratic candidate Sin- ,
clair, himself.
His whole life has been a series of j
j paradoxes. He w;is born 56 years
j ago in Baltimore of a conventional J
and staid Southern family, yet from j
such surroundings "he became the
nation's best-known radical. His i
books have probably sold better than !
those of any other American non
fiction author, yet he has always
been in debt.
On the lecture platform you will
find him explaining that he has hut
one hundred dollars in the hank,
yet in the same breath he will in
form his audience that his income j
exceeds that of the Governor |
(SHUMIO). This is mainly due to j

| Sinclair's weakness for financing ;
social colonics and epic motion |
pictures ("Thunder over Mexico").
At one time or another candidate
' Sinclair has been called a crackpot, I
j an atheist, a muck-raker, an 1.W.W.,
' an agent of Moscow, and a single
taxer. He admits it and doesn't seen\ 1
to mind; it's not surprising, for he
lives on publicity and has h flair for
I it surpassed only by President and |
Mrs. Roosevelt and Sally Rand.
Last year he {jot himself on the
front pages by being arrested for
reading the United States Consti
' tulion on his front lawn. He cam
paigned all over the stale in a j
house on wheels and charged ad
mission to his rallies. Hut he drew I
bigger crowds than arc seen at i
most loatball games, while other
candidates almost had to pay peo
ple to attend theirs.
Everybody will recall Sinclair's in- j
sistance that he supported F.D.R. j
and the New Deal. As soon as he wai.
nominated he rushed to Hyde Park i
to prove it. Just what was said was a '
mystery, but after a two-hour con- j
ference both were smiling. This is j
all the more of a mystery as the
President was supposed to have a 1
grudge against Sinclair because Mi j
Roosevelt the elder used t<> rend "The
J unfile" aloud at breakfast, tluisj

ruining Frankie's appetite for sau
sage and bacon.
On the platform Upton Sinclair
speaks in an even, bland voice,
He knows his audiences; be has
probably come into contact with
the members of more organizations
for correcting human miseries
than any other man living. He
can explain things plainly, and
brilliantly. Taking the usually
sympathetic audience along with
him with uncanny deftness, he
makes the far-fetched EPIC plan
seem as real as L.A. traffic.
Sinclair is neither an atheist nor a
crackpot. He has been disgusted by
commercialized religion and has a
supernatural hankering to be a na
tional sensation. In his personal
habits he is a teetotaler and a dys
peptic. To cure the latter he has
been a vegetarian, raw meat, and
nut eater; so far he hasn't been
successful.
In Pasadena he lives right among
the Vested Interests he has done
so much to horrify. To them he is a
symbol of.class warfare to be de
bated at all costs; to the Radicals
he is a danger to their cause—most
of them believe that if he is elected,
EPIC's failure will set them back 50
years.
Tomorrow : Sinclair and Kpic.

before. It was this following that
gave him victory in the primaries;

(he million and a half votes he will
I need next Tuesday.
But the biggest mystery of it all 1
; is how he managed to enlist such
j contrasting elements to work in such
j apparent harmony during the sum
! mer months. Many of Sinclair's ad- ;
I hcrents have no more political kin
| ship to him than they have to Ogden J
Mills. The answer lo this question is
j found in Democratic candidate Sin- ,
clair, himself.
His whole life has been a series of j
j paradoxes. He w;is born 56 years
j ago in Baltimore of a conventional J
and staid Southern family, yet from j
such surroundings "he became the
nation's best-known radical. His i
books have probably sold better than !
those of any other American non
fiction author, yet he has always
been in debt.
On the lecture platform you will
find him explaining that he has hut
one hundred dollars in the hank,
yet in the same breath he will in
form his audience that his income j
exceeds that of the Governor |
(SHUMIO). This is mainly due to j

| Sinclair's weakness for financing ;
social colonics and epic motion |
pictures ("Thunder over Mexico").
At one time or another candidate
' Sinclair has been called a crackpot, I
j an atheist, a muck-raker, an 1.W.W.,
' an agent of Moscow, and a single
taxer. He admits it and doesn't seen\ 1
to mind; it's not surprising, for he
lives on publicity and has h flair for
I it surpassed only by President and |
Mrs. Roosevelt and Sally Rand.
Last year he {jot himself on the
front pages by being arrested for
reading the United States Consti
' tulion on his front lawn. He cam
paigned all over the stale in a j
house on wheels and charged ad
mission to his rallies. Hut he drew I
bigger crowds than arc seen at i
most loatball games, while other
candidates almost had to pay peo
ple to attend theirs.
Everybody will recall Sinclair's in- j
sistance that he supported F.D.R. j
and the New Deal. As soon as he wai.
nominated he rushed to Hyde Park i
to prove it. Just what was said was a '
mystery, but after a two-hour con- j
ference both were smiling. This is j
all the more of a mystery as the

Sinclair is neither an atheist nor a

commercialized religion and has a
