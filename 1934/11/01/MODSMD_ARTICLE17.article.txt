# POLITICAL TILI HERE CREATES GREAT TENSION
## Rowell Supports Merriam; Bartlett's Arguments Uphold Sinclair 
### Cedric Larson 
Striking out at the Republican gu
bernatorial nominee and advocating
Sinclairi'ftn by Democrat Louis Bart
lett. on ihe one hand, and a militant
championing of Merriam by Re
publican Chester Rowel 1 on the other
furnished a large audience in the
Pavilion last night with one of the
best debates held on the campus.
The question will be decided at
the polls Tuesday: "Should Sin
clair or Merriam Be Governor of
California?"
Professor Edwin A. Cottrell, chair- j
man of the School of Social Sciences j
and executive head of the political 1
science department ;ft Stanford!
presided at the debate, which was j
interrupted frequently with bursts
of enthusiastic applause.
Citing unemployment figures for
California of 1,125,000, Bartlett
started the debate by holding the
Republican nominee had no adequate
plan for these people's future.
Tax Burden Cited
He pointed to an annual tax bur
den of $200,000,000 for relief, and a
present deficit of $139,000,000, which
now drain the state treasury. EPIC I
Candidate Sinclair's plan would pro- I
vide for these people, he contended. !
Rowell countered that this project j
of Sinclah-'s was only a "fragment" j
of a real aim of the Socialist author, ;
which was to establish state-wide i
and ultimately nation-wide social- !
ism. He furthermore emphasized the
fact that many bona fide Socialists
have disavowed EPIC as being un
workable.
"The essence of the EPIC plan,"
argued Bartlett, "is that people to
day walking the streets will manu
facture the things they know how to
manufacture in factories now idle,
and exchange these goods for agri- |
cultural produce grown by people;
at present on relief rolls, who will I
be placed on farm lands now unfilled !
or going to desert."
"Can't Stand Alone"
Rowell believes that such facto
ries and lands are unavailable or
nonexistent. "There is no possibility
whatever of suddenly bringing Cali
fornia alone back to prosperity, while
the rest of the world remains in pov
erty," the editor stated, "and he who
holds that hope out to the people is
deceiving them."
Barter is the fundamental tenet of
Sinclair's project, according to Bart
lett: He referred to successful barter
experiments in Los. Angeles and
Alameda.
Republican Rowell concluded the
debate with a plea to solve the pres
ent problems not by traveling the
Moscow road, but by the application
of sound remedies carefully worked
out by governmental experts.
