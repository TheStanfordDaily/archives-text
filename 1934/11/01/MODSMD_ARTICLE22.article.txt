# COURT DECISION UPHOLDS VOTERS
## Disfranchisement Move Is Blocked by Action 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 31 (/P).â€”
A writ of prohibition issued by the
State Supreme Court today will
prevent Attorney General U. S.
Webb and the Superior Court of
Los Angeles from taking any fur
ther steps to disfranchise 24,000 vot
ers who are assertedly registered
irregularly.
This writ will restrict the Superior
Court to action only against those
who have been regularly served
with summons or otherwise per
sonlly notified to appear.
The result of this action will be
that the post-card notices which
were served to a large number of
defendants will be held invalid and,
since there are only four days re
maining befoi'e the election, it will
be obviously impossible to serve reg
ular notices to all those involved.
Attorney General Webb, how
ever, announced his belief that the
proceedings accomplished their orig
inal purpose of checking wholesale
voting frauds in Los Angeles. The
legal question mixed up in the con
troversy was the right of Superior
Judge Collier to issue an order af
fecting the light of an individual to
vote.
