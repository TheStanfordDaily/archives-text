# Football Squad Leaves Tonight For L.A. Game
## Stanford Puts "Indian Sign" On Seventh Intended Gridiron Victim HIT U.C.L.A. SATURDAY Thornhill Names Traveling Group of 37 
### Millard Browne 
Stanford has set the formidable In
dian sign on number seven of her
intended gridiron victims, and the
Cardinals, H7 strong, will leave to
night to perform the cruel deed in
Olympic Stadium in Los Angeles
Saturday.
The University of. California at
Los Angeles is scheduled to be that
foredoomed seventh, and everyone,
except Tiny Thornhill and company,
who merely hope, cxpects the hoodoo
sign to be successful as it has on five
of the other six occasions.
Condition Good
Thirty-seven Red-clad football
players, with all but one in nearly
perfect condition, will be the sinis
ter weapons of attack on the black-

lutured No. 7, and they will sneak
away tonight with all the secrecy of
a circus parade for the sunny south.
The plotters include:
Centers: We.s Muller, .Nels Lar
sen, Alf Brandin, Louis Tsoutsouvar.
Guards: Larry Rouble, Woody
Adams, Jack Walton, Bob Black,
Tom Callaghan, Dave Cuneo.
Tackles: Bob Reynolds, Claude
Callaway, Ed Lettunich, Jack Drown,
Ben Palamountain, Harry Carlson.
Ends: Monk Moscrip, Keith Top
ping, Alex Trompas, Jack Clark, Car
los Monsalve, Carl Schott, Bob
Mangan.
Backs: Frank Alustiza, Stan An
derson, Earl Hoos, Bob Hamilton,
Buck Van Dellen, Bob Maentz, Gor
don Head, Johnny Reisner, Chuck
White, Joe Vigna, Fred Williams,
Bobby Grayson, Chuck Ledbetter,
and Ray Todd.
Altered Linc-Up
The eleven Red terrors who open
the attack on the ill-fated seventh
may be slightly altered in personnel
from that which was used on the
U.S.C. Trojans, stricken last Satur
day.
Black will open at running
guard in place of Adams, still be
moaning a lamely functioning
ankle. Adams may play if needed.
The questioned left halfback berth
is once again a toss-up between Van
Dellen and Maentz, and there is some
thought of opening Larsen at Mid
ler's center position.
Practice Punting
In an attempt to perfect their
lightning-like strike for victims
seven, eight, nine, and ten, the In
dians worked last night on punting,
with ends and linemen being given
workouts on covering, and safety men
working on returning.
Monk Moscrip, all-American end
candidate, failed to show for prac
tice yesterday. The reason: a slight
cold, which, however, is not expected
to keep him out of the Los Angeles
invasion.

of the other six occasions.
Condition Good
Thirty-seven Red-clad football
players, with all but one in nearly
perfect condition, will be the sinis
ter weapons of attack on the black-

lutured No. 7, and they will sneak
away tonight with all the secrecy of
a circus parade for the sunny south.
The plotters include:
Centers: We.s Muller, .Nels Lar
sen, Alf Brandin, Louis Tsoutsouvar.
Guards: Larry Rouble, Woody
Adams, Jack Walton, Bob Black,
Tom Callaghan, Dave Cuneo.
Tackles: Bob Reynolds, Claude
Callaway, Ed Lettunich, Jack Drown,
Ben Palamountain, Harry Carlson.
Ends: Monk Moscrip, Keith Top
ping, Alex Trompas, Jack Clark, Car
los Monsalve, Carl Schott, Bob
Mangan.
Backs: Frank Alustiza, Stan An
derson, Earl Hoos, Bob Hamilton,
Buck Van Dellen, Bob Maentz, Gor
don Head, Johnny Reisner, Chuck
White, Joe Vigna, Fred Williams,
Bobby Grayson, Chuck Ledbetter,
and Ray Todd.
Altered Linc-Up
The eleven Red terrors who open
the attack on the ill-fated seventh
may be slightly altered in personnel
from that which was used on the
U.S.C. Trojans, stricken last Satur
day.
Black will open at running
guard in place of Adams, still be
moaning a lamely functioning
ankle. Adams may play if needed.
The questioned left halfback berth
is once again a toss-up between Van
Dellen and Maentz, and there is some
thought of opening Larsen at Mid
ler's center position.
Practice Punting
In an attempt to perfect their
lightning-like strike for victims
seven, eight, nine, and ten, the In
dians worked last night on punting,
with ends and linemen being given
workouts on covering, and safety men
working on returning.
Monk Moscrip, all-American end
candidate, failed to show for prac
tice yesterday. The reason: a slight
cold, which, however, is not expected
to keep him out of the Los Angeles
invasion.
Stanford has set the formidable In
dian sign on number seven of her
intended gridiron victims, and the
Cardinals, H7 strong, will leave to
night to perform the cruel deed in
Olympic Stadium in Los Angeles
Saturday.
The University of. California at
Los Angeles is scheduled to be that
foredoomed seventh, and everyone,
except Tiny Thornhill and company,
who merely hope, cxpects the hoodoo
sign to be successful as it has on five
of the other six occasions.
