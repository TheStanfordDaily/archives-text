# This Uclan Mess
## 
### 
Misunderstandings, piled one on topÂ«of the
other, have evidently resulted in one of Ihe
most unfortunate incidents of the collegiate
year.
Down on the Westwood campus, a univer
sity official announces the suspension of five
students, all student leaders, including a stu
dent body president. Reasons given, for publi
cation, are that the five participated in al
leged Communistic activities, considered stag
ing a student forum to discuss the present
gubernatorial hog-calling contest, after being
warned thai no forum could be held.
At Stanford, we have already had our forum
and also a straw vole poll. Nobody has been
injured and everybody is happy except the
fellow with the votes.
Obviously, something is wrong with ibis
picture in Los Angeles. The Daily (Uilifornian
speaks of the subject editorially under the
amusing caption "A Strange Aroma," and, for
once, we bow in respect to words of wisdom.
There is a very strange smell emanating from
the Southland.
When the facts finally come out, and the
truth, it ever, is made public, the Daily ven
tures the prediction that many, many things
will have been behind the action of Tuesday.
These should have been revealed at the outset,
and the present circumstance could .not have
arisen. If, however, the stories as issued for
publication are true, one I '.C.L.A. provost will
be most embarrassed.
It is too bad that Robert Cordon Sproul
over in Berkeley, beloved California prexy,
should be forced into the position of having
to face the reaction to a decision of his sub
ordinate. Rut Dr. Sproul, educator and stu
dent of human nature, will analyze all the
evidence very thoroughly before final action
is taken.
Of that the Daily is certain. Until such
time, when the details will be fully known,
no man can say truly who is in the right.
