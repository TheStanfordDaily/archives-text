# Yale and Her Fraternities

### 
t \
The announcement that two of Vale s social
fraternities have withdrawn from their na
tional organizations and have hecomc eating
eluhs is of significance to fraternities in other
universities. It is likely that the action at
Yale is a local mailer, resulting from the
new plan of eight college organizations within
the university. y
The significance, however, lies in the fact
that if the Vale plan of a few large living
groups proves successful il may spread to
other colleges. Therefore, .just what the effect
will he on Vale's fraternities is of more than
passing interest.
The Vale literary magazine, believing that
the move will result in the inevitable discon
tinuance of all Vale's fraternities, says, "The
old lady (literary magazine) bids farewell to
a group of institutions which she has known
over a long period as fraternities. She dons

black for the first time in her history only
long enough to celebrate an inevitable re
lease."
On the otber side of the question, however,
Vale's president, Dr. .lames Rowland Angell,
expressed the belief that merely readjustment
and not extinction would be the ultimate fate
of the fraternities.
There is no doubt but what the cheaper,
more democratic hall system, carrying with it
all the comforts and conveniences that any
house could oiler, furnishes real competition
with the fraternity system.
A more constricted form of the hall-club
system has existed for a number of years at
Stanford without having any particular ell'ect
on the fraternities. Vale's more radical and
more expensive plunge into the hall plan may
have different results.
Stanford's Hall - How arrangement has
proven very satisfactory to date, and in the
clubs, fraternities, and dormitories, each man
finds his preferred surroundings. Vet, even
on the Farm, the Vale developments will be
watched with interest, as we watch for the
reaction at other institutions.
