# Jazz Goes On
## 
### 
A Princeton professor has just announced
the conclusion of three years' research on the
origin of the word "jazz." The indefatigable
pundit found it tirsl used in the negro lan
guage of the African West Coast, whence he
followed it to New Orleans, in Creole patois
it meant "hurry up."
Some obscure ebony r;ig band leader
"jazzed" his rhythms and made toes tingle to
the result; Paul Whiteman popularized the
phenomenon and elected himself King of Jazz.
To author F. Scott Fitzgerald it symbolized
an era and an altitude, so we had the jazz age.
.Hut the jazz age went out when the de
spondent 'thirties came in with the resulting
sudden demise of gin-stained and comfortable
speakeasies. People left oIT hearing jazz with
their feet and began hearing it with their ears,
so that with George Gershwin and Duke El
lington in the fore, jazz has been creeping out
of dance lloors and bespeaking itself a modest
place on the concert stage.
Some day, perhaps, Leopold Stokowski
will shock Philadelphia by driving his sym
phonic orchestra through Mood Indigo, and a
word that once was a Slave Coast grunt will
become a deft touch in the concert master's
lingers.
