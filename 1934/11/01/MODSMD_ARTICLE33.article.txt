WITH THOMAS ANDREW BAILEY
Spotlights of publicity again play upon the crucial
Salt River area of the Southwest as fresh acts of race
terrorism once more leap to newspaper headlines, and
plague the minds of statesmen.
Bombing outrages again have occurred in the
turbulent Arizona Valley as the Japanese-Amer
ican race conflict situation comes to a head. Latest
telegraphic news reports reveal new acts of vio
lence being perpetrated under cover of night.
Japanese Association of Arizona announces that
premises of Japanese farmers have been dynamited,
and link these bombings with attempts of American
farmers to exclude aliens from the Salt River Valley.
Alarmed at the gravity of developments, the Japa
nese Association has made represen tat ions to state and
federal governments, as well as Japanese consuls.
Unwillingness of occidentals to compete with a
people whose living standards are somewhat more
frugal and less pi'etentious than those of their white
neighbors is the immediate cause of these disturbances.
Dr. Thomas Andrew Bailey, professor of history,
has just issued, from (lie Stanford University Press,
a .'1515-page study of the complications arising from
the Japanese-American race problem on the Pacific
Coast. He is therefore in an expert position to probe
more deeply into the underlying causes of the
Japanese-American animus. The title of Dr. Bai
ley's book is: "Theodore. Roosevelt and the Japa
nese American Crises."
"The Arizona terrorism is but one manifestation of
the broad problem of American-Japanese relations,"
says Professor Bailey. "We must realize that at one
time United States looked upon Japan as her protege
in the Far East. Between 1898 and 1905 a great change
took place. America had defeated Spain, Japan had
vanquished Russia, and these two victors now found
themselves major powers.
"The (Theodore) Roosevelt era marks a transition in
the relations between the United States ;ind Japan.
The days when America could manifest a more or less
parental interest in her Far Eastern protege had
passed. Within the space of a decade both nations had
emerged as world powers, and as a consequence, their
interests had begun to come more and more into con
flict. Suspicion and jealousy, not unmingled with fear,
were bound to be the Unhappy produce of this changed
status.
"The golden age in Japanese-American relations
was gone, and although men might continue lo
speak of the traditional friendship as if nothing
had happened, the attitude of the two peoples
toward each other was no longer the same, and
never could be. It was the price that both Japan
and America had to pay for coining of age."
Dr. Bailey feels that the best hope for a satisfactory
solution to the prevention of vexatious racial flare-ups
of which the Arizona difficulties furnish a case in
point, lies in the creation of a better mutu'il under
standing between Japanese and Americans through
educating the rising generation of each nation in an
appreciation of the history and culture of the other.
