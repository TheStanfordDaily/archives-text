## ANOTHER “AMERICAN” SPEAKS 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
To add another voice to the
U.C.L.A. melee.
If Communism is un-American
—and it surely is at present—it is
certainly far more un-American
to prohibit the freedom of speech
of Americans.
Communism is un-American. Yes
—and I am glad of it—but it is, as
is any matter of public concern, un-
American only so long as the ma
jority of Americans do not desire it.
Perhaps we should follow out the
ideas of Plato u bit more closely and
say—only so long as the majority of
intellectual, thinking Americans do
not desire it.
This is what democracy means and
demands. This is what our Con
stitution was evolved for—in order
that we be allowed to speak freely
and be free from the fear of a mod
ern Inquisition, and that, having once
forced our conclusions, we should
have the necessary legislative ma
chinery and elasticity to continually
keep our desires, changing or un
changed, expressed by various codes
and laws.
If we wish to continue as a na
tion without revolution and blood

shed, without any sudden up
heaval, without fear of smolder
ing, underground fires, we must be
able to talk, and we must let those
who hold different opinions talk
also. For only by hearing what is
going on can we recognize the
strength and abode of our foe and
thereby be ready to defend our
selves.
Communism is and, I believe, al
' ways will be un-American and un
j desirable —it robs us of too much—
but I also believe this: that the surest
way to ensure its spread lies in per
secuting it. Persecution has been
tried before. It is wonderful pub
licity. It focuses attention. Its vic
tims become martyrs who demand
and generally get public sympathy.
The Romans tried it; the Spaniards
tried it. Shall we?
j When a thing un-American, be it
Communism or the denial of free
speech, becomes American we want
to know it, we must know it, and
we want our legislative bodies to
respond. Only thus can we hope for
an ordered, conservative change
toward a better future. Such is our
birthright, and we must have it.
