# THE U.C.L.A. RUMPUS
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
In yesterday's Campus Opinion
there was some comment on the sit
uation at U.C.L.A. by "An Amer
ican." It is in answer to this that I
write these questions.
Are the students of this Univer
sity so incapable of judging for
themselves that there is danger of
us all becoming Communistic?
Is it un-American to defend the
rights of a minority even though
their ideas do not agree with our
own? If this university is democratic
as the author states, then is not

f freedom of speech and of thought
also incorporated into our tradition?
I have at times had contact with
the N.S.L. and I am forced to admh
i that the impression that I gained
was not very satisfactory. However,
that the students of U.C.L.A. wete
j willing to elect fools for their presi
dent and officers, seems quite un
likely. Considering all of this, let
The Daily and the students fight for
I them against one of the lowest po
litical moves to which a university
! can be subjected, that of acting as
' a pawn in a political campaign.
