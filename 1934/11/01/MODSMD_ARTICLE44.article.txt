HAIL TO THE
UNMENTIONED
Just a few unsung toasts:
Here's to Frankie Alustiza.
For he's a jolly good kicker,
For he's a jolly good blocker,
For he's a jolly good plunger,
Which nobody can deny.
Now substitute the names of
Bones Hamilton, Claude Callaway,
liob Reynolds, Wes Muller, and a
few others, and sing the same tune.
It will come as a surprise to those
who have been named. They have
become used to playing football
without mention—just taken for
granted.
Or you might vary the words a
bit, with:
Here's to Bones Hamilton, tried and
true,
For he's an all-American through
and through.
But Bones will not be an all-
American this year, and maybe
never. He has too much internal
competition, and it wouldn't look
right to have an all-star team look
like a Stanford starting line-up.
TROJANS FELL;
WHO'S FAULT?
Who beat U.S.C.?
Bobby Grayson and Monk Mos
crip, who scored all the points, had
a lot to do with it. But what about
Alustiza's kicking? Twice the Card
inal quarterback punted out of
bounds within the Trojan two-yard
line. Besides that, he, together with
Hamilton, did of the blocking
that paved Grayson's way. And
Alustiza's drive gained a yard or
two in its own right.
What was it that kept the
Thundering Herd from thunder
ing? IWoscrip was one of the big
factors. But Callaway and Rey
nolds were decidedly in every
play, and they broke up Trojan
plays time after time.
So was Muller, and Lany Rouble
and Woody Adams, and Keith Top
ping. But somehow, after the deeds
of Grayson and Moscrip are related
each Saturday, there is strangely not
enough room to mention some of the
less spectacular of the Indians, and
it takes newspaper publicity to make
an all-American, or even an all-
Coast football player.
CARD - WASIIINGTON
GAME A NATURAL
Now that Stanford-Husky battle
has looked good ever since Wash
ington beat a strong Oregon team
three weeks ago. It was completely
made, however, as a drawing card
last Saturday when both Washing
ton and Stanford triumphed over
California and U.S.C.
The Board of Athletic Control is
expectantly rubbing its collective
hands with the prospect of the first
and only capacity crowd in the
Stanford Stadium on November 10.
And that same board is mildly kick
ing itself for having set the price at
$1.65.
It is not certain that the winner of
the game will play, or even be asked
to play, in the Rose Bowl. But these
two teams are the outstanding
choices at this stage in the season.
COUGARS ARE
STILL IN RACE
But it is almost definite that these
two, plus the Washington State
Cougars, are the only ones who will
be considered.
Just in case Washington beats
Stanford and Washington State
beats Washington, both of which
phenomena are possible, the Cou
gars would be the logical choice
for the Pasadena classic. That, of
course, is assuming that no other
hard luck hits any of these three
teams.
But aii three will run into other
difficulties. Washington State meets
St. Mary's this week-end, and the
Cougars are slight underdogs. Stan
ford meets U.C.L.A., and the Bruins
have a better chance to topple the
Indians than many other teams this
season. The Huskies will run up
against trouble in Oregon State, and
some more hot water in U.S.C. on
December 1. —Millard Browne.
