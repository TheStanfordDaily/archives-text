HAIL TO THE
UNMENTIONED
Just a few unsung toasts:
Here's to Frankie Alustiza.
For he's a jolly good kicker,
For he's a jolly good blocker,
For he's a jolly good plunger,
Which nobody can deny.
Now substitute the names of
Bones Hamilton, Claude Callaway,
liob Reynolds, Wes Muller, and a
few others, and sing the same tune.
It will come as a surprise to those
who have been named. They have
become used to playing football
without mention—just taken for
granted.
Or you might vary the words a
bit, with:
Here's to Bones Hamilton, tried and
true,
For he's an all-American through
and through.
But Bones will not be an all-
American this year, and maybe
never. He has too much internal
competition, and it wouldn't look
right to have an all-star team look
like a Stanford starting line-up.
TROJANS FELL;
WHO'S FAULT?
Who beat U.S.C.?
Bobby Grayson and Monk Mos
crip, who scored all the points, had
a lot to do with it. But what about
Alustiza's kicking? Twice the Card
inal quarterback punted out of
bounds within the Trojan two-yard
line. Besides that, he, together with
Hamilton, did of the blocking
that paved Grayson's way. And
Alustiza's drive gained a yard or
two in its own right.
What was it that kept the
Thundering Herd from thunder
ing? IWoscrip was one of the big
factors. But Callaway and Rey
nolds were decidedly in every
play, and they broke up Trojan
plays time after time.
So was Muller, and Lany Rouble
and Woody Adams, and Keith Top
ping. But somehow, after the deeds
of Grayson and Moscrip are related
each Saturday, there is strangely not
enough room to mention some of the
less spectacular of the Indians, and
it takes newspaper publicity to make
an all-American, or even an all-
Coast football player.
