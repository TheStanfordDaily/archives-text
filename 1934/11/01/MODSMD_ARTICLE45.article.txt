# Cards, Dons Play Second Soccer Tilt
## 
### John McClelland 
The David and Goliath of soccer
will clash again Saturday.
San Francisco University is sending
j its power-house eleven, conference
champions for two consecutive sea
sons, down to the Farm, there to meet
I the Cards for the second time this
I year.
But it will be a bigger and stronger
and more experienced David that
will set out to face the so-called
invincible Dons Saturday. And the
honor of the name of David may be
upheld.
Cards in Better Shape
When the Indians played U.S.F.
J two weeks ago they were suffering
j from injuries and lack of sufficient
practice. Plenty of the latter has
been gotten in during the past 14
j days and the former is not so great
a handicap.
Last year the city team won the
| first game with Stanford just as they
did this year. But the Dons lost
the second, 2-3.
During practice this week Coach
Maloney has been experimenting
j with his forward line, the source of
most of his grief this year.
Gomez Moved
Mike Gomez has been moved into
the outside left position replacing
Enke and is showing up very well.
Najeeb Halaby flanks Gomez at out- 1
side right, filling in Sawyer's place, j
Dibblee, Kuw, and Forhan complete :
the quintet which, according to Ma
loney, is the best combination he has |
yet been able to put together.
That Maloney believes his men to j
have a change against the Dons Sat- j
urday is shown by the intensive!
practices which he is putting them
through every afternoon this week. '
The best team the Cards can field \
against the top-notchers in the con- j
ference is the set-up for Saturday.
