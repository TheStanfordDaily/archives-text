j A 15-yard clipping penalty against
Theta Xi in an extra period of an
| intramural game yesterday lost them
| the contest to Delta Chi in competi
| tion which was also marked by two
easy victories and a forfeit. Delta
i Chi won their game 2 to 0 in an extra
i period to play oil' a tie that had re
; suited.
Defending champions Sigma Nu I
| had no trouble with a stubborn D.U.
aggregation and won by the score
|of 21 to 0. S.A.E. subdued the Forg
j ers 13 to 0, and El Cuadro failed to
I appeal* and so forfeited the fourth
' game of the day's activities to Zeta
Psi.
Delta Chi and Theta Xi fought to
a scoreless tie, which necessitated an
j extra period of play in the closest
j contest of the afternoon. Each team j
j was given the ball for five plays, with
j the team making the most yardage in ;
i that time begin awarded the decision. |
i Both resorted to fruitless passes and -
' the break finally came with the pen-
I alty against Theta Xi.
Sigma Nu's well-organized and po
i tent passing attack snowed under
' the D.U. team. Bud Shreve led the
j Sigma Nu attack and heaved two
i touchdown passes to Howard Buller;
! and Ted Leidig respectively.
i The S.A.E.'s clicking passes proved I
; too much for the Forgers. Jack I
Damerel scored the first of the win- !
i ner's touchdowns with a beautiful
j 60-yard run. Another score came by
I another run on the part of Dale
Dodds.
