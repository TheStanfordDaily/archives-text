# WAR THREATS GRIP FRENCH
## Cabinet Members Uneasy Over Saar Region 
### 
PARIS, Oct. 31 (/P).â€”Grave fears
that war preparations may lead to
war were expressed here today in
high quarters.
An important cabinet member in
a private conversation recently
stated the belief: "France faces a
state of war." He said, "the majo
rity of cabinet members feel this to
be true."
Pierre Laval, minister of foreign
affairs, skirted the subject in a press
conference tonight and said:
"We have slipped back into the
middle ages. Civilization is going to
pot. We must defend it."
Germany Feared
| The warning which Marshall Henri
Petain, minister of war, gave October
19 that France must prepare for a
shock and the statement that Ger
many is becoming formidable voiced
the official feeling and caused a gen
eral wave of anxiety, especially along
1 the frontier of the Saar basin.
Members of the finance commit
tee, after hearing the "Victor of
: Verdun," said they expected not only
| to make heavy military expenditures
'out of, the budgeted 11,330,000,000
francs ($6,477,800,000) for national
I defense, but predicted that the gov
[ eminent would soon ask the length
, ening of military service.
French Imply Warning
The French determination to throw
troops into the plebiscite area the
I moment the Saar governing com
| mision, which operates under the
League of Nations, should appeal for
help is officially admitted to be in-
I tended as a warning to Germany
{ against any resort to violence and
lan effort to be prepared for any
eventuality.
Some deputies say they fear Ger
| many is nearly ready for war and
; that friction in the Saar might be
utilized as an excuse to start the j
l conflict.
