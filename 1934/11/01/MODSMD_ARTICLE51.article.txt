# WATER POLOISTS ENTRAIN TONIGHT FOR S.C CONTEST
## 
### 
Facing a hard game followed by
ian easy one, the Cardinal varsity
j water polo team will entrain tonight
| for Los Angeles. Nort Thornton's
I aquatic pastimers will clash with
! U.C.L.A. tomorrow and U.S.C. Sat-
I urday in return games.
Since the Indians barely nosed out
the hard-fighting Bruins, 3 to 2, in
Encina pool two weeks ago, they will
have their hands full in playing the
southerners at 3:30 o'clock in the
Westwood tank. Sellars at forward
and Knox and Daubenspeck, guards,
are stars rivaling any of Stanford's,
and will keep the Cards busy as long
as they are in the game.
Rough Tilt Predicted
If this return tilt is as rough as
the game here, the two aggregations
will be cut down until they have
about one full team between them
before the game is very old. Count
ing separately those who were ex
pelled twice, five Stanfordites and
four Uclans were thrown out of
that first struggle for unnecessary
roughness.
Not only their natural rivalry but
also thoughts of the conference
standings will drive Stanford and
U.C.L.A. on in their furious battle
for victory. If the Bruins lose, they
will be out of the race, and Stanford
must win in order to remain in the
running in the case of a possible de
feat by California later in the sea
son. The games will also be part of
Homecoming Day on the southern
campus.
Meet Trojans
Even after the Bruin tilt, the In
dians will still have work to do, since
they are to meet the Trojans in the
U.S.C. pool at 11 o'clock Saturday
morning. This game should be much
easier, unless the U.S.C. outfit has
shown great improvement since Sat
urday, when Stanford whipped it,
13 to 2.
As far as is known at present,
Thornton will start the regular first
string in both games. This line-up
is as follows: Cook, Taranik, and
Foster or Clemo, forwards; Wiget,
Benet, and Woodard, guards; and
Haslacher, goalie. Stanford rooters
who go south for the football game
with U.C.L.A. Saturday are also in
vited to attend the water polo frays.

U.C.L.A. on in their furious battle
for victory. If the Bruins lose, they
will be out of the race, and Stanford
must win in order to remain in the
running in the case of a possible de
feat by California later in the sea
son. The games will also be part of
Homecoming Day on the southern
campus.
Meet Trojans
Even after the Bruin tilt, the In
dians will still have work to do, since
they are to meet the Trojans in the
U.S.C. pool at 11 o'clock Saturday
morning. This game should be much
easier, unless the U.S.C. outfit has
shown great improvement since Sat
urday, when Stanford whipped it,
13 to 2.
As far as is known at present,
Thornton will start the regular first
string in both games. This line-up
is as follows: Cook, Taranik, and
Foster or Clemo, forwards; Wiget,
Benet, and Woodard, guards; and
Haslacher, goalie. Stanford rooters
who go south for the football game
with U.C.L.A. Saturday are also in
vited to attend the water polo frays.
Facing a hard game followed by
ian easy one, the Cardinal varsity
j water polo team will entrain tonight
| for Los Angeles. Nort Thornton's
I aquatic pastimers will clash with
! U.C.L.A. tomorrow and U.S.C. Sat-
I urday in return games.
Since the Indians barely nosed out
the hard-fighting Bruins, 3 to 2, in
Encina pool two weeks ago, they will
have their hands full in playing the
southerners at 3:30 o'clock in the
Westwood tank. Sellars at forward
and Knox and Daubenspeck, guards,
are stars rivaling any of Stanford's,
and will keep the Cards busy as long
as they are in the game.
Rough Tilt Predicted
If this return tilt is as rough as
the game here, the two aggregations
will be cut down until they have
about one full team between them
before the game is very old. Count
ing separately those who were ex
pelled twice, five Stanfordites and
four Uclans were thrown out of
that first struggle for unnecessary
roughness.
Not only their natural rivalry but
also thoughts of the conference
standings will drive Stanford and
U.C.L.A. on in their furious battle
for victory. If the Bruins lose, they
will be out of the race, and Stanford
must win in order to remain in the
running in the case of a possible de
feat by California later in the sea
son. The games will also be part of
Homecoming Day on the southern
