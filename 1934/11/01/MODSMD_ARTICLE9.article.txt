tumes of the Gay Nineties, and to
| enact the manners of a bygone day.
j So discovered the cast of "One Sun
day Afternoon," in last night's dress

although .still believing himself in
j love with Virginia Brash, played by

tion with Phil Brown as Snappy
Downer, a boyhood acquaintance.
Hears of Rival
He hears with amazement that his
life-long rival, who eloped with Vir
ginia, is in town and in need of im
mediate dental attention.

revenge. Barnstead arrives. Biff
savagely administers the gas, and
the scene fades into the 1 SfJO's.
Occurrences during their youth are
depicted in the gay manner of that
period. Colorful scenes in Avery's
Park and a typical German beer gar
den, with costumes the most elab
orate in recent dramatic productions,
