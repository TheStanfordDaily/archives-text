# CAST PREPARED, SCENE SET FOR TONIGHT'S PLAY
## Dress Rehearsal Indicates Expert Performance At 8:30 Tonight TICKETS SOLD TODAY Leadings Roles Taken By Arthur, Kilby, Crary Brown, O'Neil 
### Annalee Whitmore 
With last night's successful dress
rehearsal already history, a confi
dent Dramatic Council awaits to
night's production of "One Sunday
Afternoon." Cast is letter-perfect.
Props, numerous and varied, are on
hand. Scenery is piled carefully
backstage, in readiness for the rapid
shifting required by James Hagan's
unusual plot.
Tfie time is 8:30 o'clock. Assem
bly Hall; occasion, Stanford debut
of William Murray Tmunons as
dramatic director. And an ex
tremely gratifying debut it will
undoubtedly be. if the perform
ance proper equals the pace set
last night.
The hitherto unprecedented use of
a rehearsal schedule, and a re
hearsal schedule which actually
worked, was instituted as one of
Timmons' innovations. Tonight's
cast, totaling 19, is perhaps better
prepared than in nine out of ten
previous performances.
Props on Hand
They have had complete props for
almost a week. Final polishing was
completed Wednesday, in the first of
two dress rehearsals. Last night's
performance could have been pre
sented as the play itself, and would
have received high commendation.
The majority of players arc fa
miliar to campus audiences. Kay
Arthur has filled such varied roles
as feminine lead in "Distant
Drums" and the Swedish maid in
"Three-Cornered Moon." Har
riette Hall Kilby appeared as flap
per Kitty in the latter production
and has wide background of ex
perience ranging from play read
ings to Gaieties.
Paul Grary likewise is a dramatic
veteran. "Distant Drums" provided
the most recent of his roles, in all
of which he appeared to advantage.
Frank O'Neill, lightly less known, is
nevertheless an actor of note.
Brown Surprises
The characterization of Phil
Brown has been one of the major
surprises. Brown previously distin
guished himself by his dance num
ber with Harriette Hall Kilby in last
year's Gaieties, and was largely re
sponsible for Encina's winning of
the award for outstanding perform
ances. As "Snappy Downer," Brown
achieves a finely-drawn characteri
zation out of all proportion to his
comparatively meager experience.
Virginia Swafford, Clare O'Don
nell, and Frances Ferry also make
their debut this evening. University
regulations prohibiting freshman
women from participating in dra
matic functions has made this their
first opportunity.
Jean Albertson, always capable
and needing no introduction, con
tinues her record in "One Sunday
Afternoon." She plays an elderly
part and, remarks Timmons, plays
it to perfection.
Kudolph Kalenborn, Harold Kahn,
Jr., Robert Boyd, George Livermore,
George Fuller, Douglas McKellar,
Jeanne Melton, Joseph Lowry, Cur
tis Barnes, and William Yeoman
complete the roster of thespians
taking part.

undoubtedly be. if the perform
ance proper equals the pace set
last night.
The hitherto unprecedented use of
a rehearsal schedule, and a re
hearsal schedule which actually
worked, was instituted as one of
Timmons' innovations. Tonight's
cast, totaling 19, is perhaps better
prepared than in nine out of ten
previous performances.
Props on Hand
They have had complete props for
almost a week. Final polishing was
completed Wednesday, in the first of
two dress rehearsals. Last night's
performance could have been pre
sented as the play itself, and would
have received high commendation.
The majority of players arc fa
miliar to campus audiences. Kay
Arthur has filled such varied roles
as feminine lead in "Distant
Drums" and the Swedish maid in
"Three-Cornered Moon." Har
riette Hall Kilby appeared as flap
per Kitty in the latter production
and has wide background of ex
perience ranging from play read
ings to Gaieties.
Paul Grary likewise is a dramatic
veteran. "Distant Drums" provided
the most recent of his roles, in all
of which he appeared to advantage.
Frank O'Neill, lightly less known, is
nevertheless an actor of note.
Brown Surprises
The characterization of Phil
Brown has been one of the major
surprises. Brown previously distin
guished himself by his dance num
ber with Harriette Hall Kilby in last
year's Gaieties, and was largely re
sponsible for Encina's winning of
the award for outstanding perform
ances. As "Snappy Downer," Brown
achieves a finely-drawn characteri
zation out of all proportion to his
comparatively meager experience.
Virginia Swafford, Clare O'Don
nell, and Frances Ferry also make
their debut this evening. University
regulations prohibiting freshman
women from participating in dra
matic functions has made this their
first opportunity.
Jean Albertson, always capable
and needing no introduction, con
tinues her record in "One Sunday
Afternoon." She plays an elderly
part and, remarks Timmons, plays
it to perfection.
Kudolph Kalenborn, Harold Kahn,
Jr., Robert Boyd, George Livermore,
George Fuller, Douglas McKellar,
Jeanne Melton, Joseph Lowry, Cur
tis Barnes, and William Yeoman
complete the roster of thespians
taking part.
With last night's successful dress
rehearsal already history, a confi
dent Dramatic Council awaits to
night's production of "One Sunday
Afternoon." Cast is letter-perfect.
Props, numerous and varied, are on
hand. Scenery is piled carefully
backstage, in readiness for the rapid
shifting required by James Hagan's
unusual plot.
Tfie time is 8:30 o'clock. Assem
bly Hall; occasion, Stanford debut
of William Murray Tmunons as
dramatic director. And an ex
tremely gratifying debut it will
undoubtedly be. if the perform
ance proper equals the pace set
last night.
