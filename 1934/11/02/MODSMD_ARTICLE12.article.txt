## 
### FRANK HINMAN 
Campaign headquarters are bustling as the freshman class election
nears. This morning in the early hours carriers were running up and
down the dim corridors of Encina placing election circulars under the
doors. Placards have been placed at strategic points. Even an automobile
has been decorated with a "Vote for Bush" sign.

ihe polls will be open rrom
to 2 o'clock today at the Law steps
in this election for the officers of
the class of '38. All freshmen are
urged to be there and vote, as this
is predicted to be one of the closest
i contests in Stanford history.
Rules Must Be Followed
"Read your ballot carefully first,"
warns John Brock, chairman of the
election board. There are four rules
which must be followed to make the
ballot valid. First, use ink. Second,
vote with cross marks only. Third,
put your first choice in the first col
umn, your second choice in the sec
ond column, and your third choice in
! the third column. And fourth, there
j must be throe choices marked to
validate the ballot.
The contestants for the office of
I president are: Mack Pope, James
Hooker, Bill Ellis, Kenneth Peters,
Edmond Gillette, John Curran, Bill
Lange, and Foster Markoff.
Nine for Sec.-Treasurer
For secretary-treasurer there are:
. Margaret "Cave, Don Dewar, Jack
Ellis, Guy Haggerty, Matt Dilling
ham, Gordon Pearson, David Hook
; er, Jacqueline Brown, and Irving
I Hawkins.
As there were no declinations
handed in to the committee during
i the period for that purpose from 9
j to 12 o'clock yesterday, the list of
candidates is the same as printed
i yesterday.
Unofficial observers foresee, ac
i cording to latest reports, an exceed
j ingly small margin of victory for ihe
winning candidate, so campaign
managers are unanimous in saying,
"Get out and vote."
