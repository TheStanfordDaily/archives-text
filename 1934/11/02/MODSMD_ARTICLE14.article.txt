# SINCLAIR: AND EPIC

### CROMPTON BANGS, Jr 
EPIC stands for End Poverty in
California. Republicans say it means
End Prosperity in Californa. Mr.
Hearst calls it Ipecac. What is it
anyway?
Over a year ago Upton Sinclair
wrote a pamphlet called "I, Gover
nor of California, and How I Ended
Poverty"; in it he presented the
EPIC plan. People must be inter
ested, for it has sold half a million
copies. Just why they were, we saw
in the last two articles. But to ap
peal to as many people as it has,
EPIC must offer a lot. It does.
The main idea of the plan iso
carry on barter with the help of
the state. In order to do this,
three agencies were to be formed:
(1) California Authority for Land
(CAL), which would take over
idle, foreclosed or tax sale land,
turn it over to colonies of jobless
to cultivate for their own sub
sistence; (2) California Authority
for Production (CAP), which
would buy or lease idle factories
where unemployed could make
products to exchange with CAL;
CO California Authority for Mon
ey (CAM), which would issue
paper script to carry on barter
between CAP and CAL; it would
also issue bonds to buy land and
factories.
Besides; this the tax burden was

to be shifted. The sales tax was to
go at once; homes and ranches occu
pied by owners and assessed at less
than $3000 were to be tax-free. To
make up the difference heavy taxes
were to be put on inheritances, in
comes, public utilities, banks, and
idle land.
With the state's large proportion of
elderly people m mind, EPIC would
pension at $50 per month all widows
and dependent children, all the
needy over 60 resident for more
than 3 years, and all invalids. About
000,000 people have to be taken care
of under the pension plan. Total
cost: $3(50,000,000 a year if adopted.
With EPIC as his platform, Sin
clair campaigned; soon he hitched
it to the New Deal. It went over big
in Southern California; pretty well
elsewhere. As we have seen its main
appeal was to the state's half million
jobless. With their help Sinclair was
nominated, much to the embarrass
ment of the Democratic National
Committee, Mr. Farley, etc.
Came (lie time when the party
platform had to he drawn up. The
preliminary conferences were held
at the nominee's Pasadena home;
(ieorge Creel, (lie defeated Ad
ministration candidate, attended
all of them. A clever politician, he
insisted on very general statements
in the platform; at the same time
lu* (old Sinclair not fo abandon the

EPIC plan as it was the source of
his strength.
The finished product failed to
mention EPIC by name; in fact, the
whole plan was missing except for
pledges to find work for the unem
ployed; to exempt from taxation the
first $1000 (instead of $3,000 of as
sessed valuation of homes and farms:
to repeal the sales tax, substituting
increased income, bank, and inher
itance taxes. Apparently the party
felt this was as far as it could go
without scaring the more conserva
tive voters.
About the same time the platform
was announced, Sinclair brought
out his "Immediate Epic," a con -
siderable modification of the orig
inal, but it was still on the back
cover as big as life. The scrip idea
was modified, and (he 300 million
dollar bond issue to buy land and
factories was abandoned for a hand
to-mouth financing scheme in which
the utilities were to furnish the nec
essary cash.
Although having to back down
considerably on the original EPIC,
Sinclair still felt hopeful; but Demo
crats were scared. McAdoo headed
for Mexico, Creel for Washington,
both washing their hands of the
whole affair. But they were in too
deep to get out.
Tomorrow: Sinclair—The Cntnaign.

EPIC stands for End Poverty in
California. Republicans say it means
End Prosperity in Californa. Mr.
Hearst calls it Ipecac. What is it
anyway?
Over a year ago Upton Sinclair
wrote a pamphlet called "I, Gover
nor of California, and How I Ended
Poverty"; in it he presented the
EPIC plan. People must be inter
ested, for it has sold half a million
copies. Just why they were, we saw
in the last two articles. But to ap
peal to as many people as it has,
EPIC must offer a lot. It does.
The main idea of the plan iso
carry on barter with the help of
the state. In order to do this,
three agencies were to be formed:
(1) California Authority for Land
(CAL), which would take over
idle, foreclosed or tax sale land,
turn it over to colonies of jobless
to cultivate for their own sub
sistence; (2) California Authority
for Production (CAP), which
would buy or lease idle factories
where unemployed could make
products to exchange with CAL;
CO California Authority for Mon
ey (CAM), which would issue
paper script to carry on barter
between CAP and CAL; it would
also issue bonds to buy land and
factories.
Besides; this the tax burden was

to be shifted. The sales tax was to
go at once; homes and ranches occu
pied by owners and assessed at less
than $3000 were to be tax-free. To
make up the difference heavy taxes
were to be put on inheritances, in
comes, public utilities, banks, and
idle land.
With the state's large proportion of
elderly people m mind, EPIC would
pension at $50 per month all widows
and dependent children, all the
needy over 60 resident for more
than 3 years, and all invalids. About
000,000 people have to be taken care
of under the pension plan. Total
cost: $3(50,000,000 a year if adopted.
With EPIC as his platform, Sin
clair campaigned; soon he hitched
it to the New Deal. It went over big
in Southern California; pretty well
elsewhere. As we have seen its main
appeal was to the state's half million
jobless. With their help Sinclair was
nominated, much to the embarrass
ment of the Democratic National
Committee, Mr. Farley, etc.
Came (lie time when the party
platform had to he drawn up. The
preliminary conferences were held
at the nominee's Pasadena home;
(ieorge Creel, (lie defeated Ad
ministration candidate, attended
all of them. A clever politician, he
insisted on very general statements
in the platform; at the same time
lu* (old Sinclair not fo abandon the

EPIC plan as it was the source of
his strength.
The finished product failed to
mention EPIC by name; in fact, the
whole plan was missing except for
pledges to find work for the unem
ployed; to exempt from taxation the
first $1000 (instead of $3,000 of as
sessed valuation of homes and farms:
to repeal the sales tax, substituting
increased income, bank, and inher
itance taxes. Apparently the party
felt this was as far as it could go
without scaring the more conserva
tive voters.
About the same time the platform
was announced, Sinclair brought
out his "Immediate Epic," a con -
siderable modification of the orig
inal, but it was still on the back
cover as big as life. The scrip idea
was modified, and (he 300 million
dollar bond issue to buy land and
factories was abandoned for a hand
to-mouth financing scheme in which
the utilities were to furnish the nec
essary cash.
