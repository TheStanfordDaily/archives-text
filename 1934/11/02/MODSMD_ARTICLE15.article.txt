WOODFORD BRIDE, England, |
Nov. 1 (/Pi. â€” Winston Churchill,
former chancellor of the exchequer |
of Great Britain, declared today in
a speech to members of his con- |
stituency that Germany was re- !
armirjg "secretly, illegally and rap- ;
idly."
In his speech, Churchill rapped the l
national government for failing to I
speed up its program for air de- ;
l'ense.
"A reign of terror exists in Ger- j
many in order to keep secret the j
feverish and terrible preparations!
they are making," declare Churchill. I
"Even in organized military ma- j
chines alone, Germany will have!
overtaken us before another year i
has passed.
"The Germans also have gigantic [
civil aviation with enormous re- 1
serves of pilots and airplanes, many j
of them faster than our fastest mili- j
tary machines."
Churchill continued: "Vice-Pre
mier Stanley Baldwin has said, 'Our
frontiers are the Rhine.'
"Can we be sure that the men i
now in control of Germany will not j
reply to that: 'Our targets are the J
Thames.'"
