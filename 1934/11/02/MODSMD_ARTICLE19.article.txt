BEREKELEY, Nov. 1 (/P.)â€”Presi
dent Robert Gordon Sproul of the !
University of California today took
into his own hands the investigation
into the University of California at
Los Angeles suspension of five stu
dents charged with "radicalism."
He will go tonight to Los An
geles for a personal inquiry, after
having failed to receive the "full
explanation" he previously asked
from provost Ernest C. Moore of
U.C.L.A.
Sproul's office said a wire had
been sent Tuesday to Moore for a
report, but the only information re
ceived was a brief telegram from
him early Tuesday stating the mere
fact of the suspension. Yesterday
Moore annnounced he was sending
the statement, but the office said it
had not appeared.
Sproul's action follows University
of California and Stanford protests
against the suspensions.
