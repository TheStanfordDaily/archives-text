# Stanford Gridmen Favored to Down Bruins Tomorrow
## Indian Mentors Worried Over U.C.L.A. Game in Olympic Stadium; Black, Maentz To Start; Cards Will Hold Final Practice in South Today 
### MILLARD BROWNE 
U.C.L.A. is like a bull. She doesn't like Red.
U.C'.L.A. recently expelled five Reds.
The Bruins have intentions of expelling eleven more come Saturday
and a football contest in Olympic Stadium.
Lots of other people, particularly people from Berkeley, Troyville,
and the good Northwest, also don't like Red, and they would set up a

â€¢collective snoui 01 giec n inc uuie
sister of the Coast football confer-
I ence should suspend those eleven
Reels from Rose Bowl consideration.
The Stanford Cardinals, alias those
nasty eleven Reds, have ideas of
I becoming terrific kill-joys come Sat
urday and a football contest in
Olympic Stadium. They don't like
1 to hear shouts of glee from Ber
! keley, Troyville, and the good old
; Northwest, anyway.

That is all a simple way of an
nouncing the fact that Stanford and
U.C.L.A. plan conference gridiron
combat in the "biggest city of the
United States."
Stanford, favored quite heavily,
has finally come to the conclusion
that the Bruins are not set-ups.
The Bruins are also fully aware
that Tiny Thornhill's Indians are
good. So there are no psycholog
ical secrets.
Thornhill and party of 37 Indian
conference title hopefuls left for
Los Angeles last night. Quite jovial
and confident seemed they all. But
Thornhill and coaching staff carried
a funny feeling of anxiety, which is
quite understandable, considering:
1. Stanford is meeting the Bruins
just after the Trojan game, and
with their minds already troubled
about Washington.
2. The "little sister" is growing
up. She slapped back at Big Brother
Cardinal two years ago, and took
but a 3-point paddling last fall.
Both times Stanford was somewhat
heavily favored.
3. Coach Bill Spaulding and his
Communists (assuming, of course,
that all U.C.L.A. students are Com
munists) held the University of
Northern California at Berkeley to
3 points two weeks ago, and the
game was a toss-up all the way,
except that the Bruins forgot to
place kick when they were near the
Bear pay dirt.
Uclan Strength
And there are other excuses for
the Indian coaching staff's queer
feeling of possible impending doom.
Among these are Charles Cheshire,
Mike Frankovich, Wilton Wilton,
Captain Ransom Livesay, high-rat
ing Bruin backs, and Verdi Boyer,
Duke Trotter, and other linesmen.
Stanford will combat this dose
with a lot of varied ball-carrying by
Bobby Grayson, Bones Hamilton,
and Frankie Alustiza, with a bit of
Bob Maentz, Buck Van Dellen, and
Gordy Head thrown in to insure a
cure for U.C.L.A.'s beat-Stanford
hallucinations.
Past Scores
There was a time that Stanford
became very tired of running up to
the U.C.L.A. goal line, as in 1925,
when the final score read Indians
82, Bruins 0. But lately they have
become very tired from other
sources than trundling across Bruin
goal lines.
