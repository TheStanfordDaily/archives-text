# A 						Community Of Individuals?
## 
### 
It is one of those debatable questions, but
lite real answer should be of more than usual
interest. Especially if il should be proved
beyond any reasonable doubt that the situ
alion has been developed entirely at Stanford.
You'll awaken this morning, read the head
lines over the conventional breakfast snack,
and perhaps might trouble to glance across the
way at your neighbor. In ninety per cent of
the eases you might as well have stared at
yourself in a mirror.
Drop in to audit ;i lecture hour before noon,
stand behind the gesticulating professor so
nobody can see you, and if the sight isn't
conducive to a good sound sleep without the
aid of any sedatives, maybe we're wrong.
ISells clang, books close, we dash off on
nuis.se for something to eat. 11 is noon. Today
we stop at Koble, where freshman women
gradually emerge from the mold as an integral
part of the community. The lobby is crowded,
people are talking, but individuals mean noth
ing. II is a good mob scene. Hollywood might
save money and shoot the works here. Stan
ford women—are they all the same?
Encina Commons, freshmen stacked end to
end with anxious sponsors ever on the lookout
. . . on and on, we cover the campus, reach
tlie How.
With few exceptions, fraternities are able
to provide a bit more in the line of variety. In
most cases, fraternity men are still able to
live with each other in the same house without
borrowing personal habits, mannerisms, etc.
dross the street to any sorority, a few in par
ticular.
"See that girl?" says the fellow next to you.
"She's a do (irnbbit dimmer" (not really).
"How do 1 know? Watch her for ten seconds
and see for yourself."
Sorority women at Stanford are fairly well
stereotyped. Each house selects the innocent
I'rosh because the latter (1.E.) acts, does, or
talks like the rest of the gais in lhat house.
That is, if Hoble has not already made said
I.E. like every other I.E. in the dormitory.
Interest is unlimited rambling on in this
vein, and we could delve indelinitely into the
well of why we are as we seem to be.
Sit down in a quiet corner, before it's 100
late, and figure il out for yourself. Are ijou
.just another carbon copy of the person across
the hall? Or do you still en joy being yourself
once in a while, letting the mob to pot in
its own mad wav?
