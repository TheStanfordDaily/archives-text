I! anyone demands continuation that the
demise of American individualism is an ac
tuality lie might study the piteous predica
ment of the majority of American citizens
above the age of (id. Plainly, they are tortured
with the r|nest ion ofwluil is to become of them,
and so keenly are they distressed that a resort
to all manner of crackpot schemes is the mode.
The President's committee on security will

undoubtedly adopt some kind ol' pensioning
process before this winter is out; in the mean
while' it is deluded with economic
queries submitted by puzzled old men and
women. Not the least workable is Qtlii'ornian
Dr. Townsend's *200 a month plan. Accord
ing to Townsend, every person above the age
of (50, who has no criminal record, will he
given $20(1 a month, provided he spends it all
immediately and attempts no hoarding.
Honest l)r. Hklwin Witte, executive director
of the President's committee, estimates that
it would lake $24,000,000, or half the annual
income of the United Stales, to provide this
monthly dole for the benefit of ten per cent
of the population. A huge taxation program
would of necessity be undertaken, but the cost
would be cheap if the program would revive
America to the extent that Dr. Townsend be
lieves possible.
Almost all American groups seem to be en
gaged with chisels nowadays, and all working
mightily. The American Legion wants theirs;
so do the laboring men; and business seems
to have a perennial bellyache. Perhaps the
one group which is least exploiting the itching
palm is the student factor.
Perhaps a coalition might be eHeeled with
the Townsend organization, with us offering
full co-operation in exchange for half of their
monthly .$2OO, when and if they get it. .loe
College could promise without tongue in
cheek, to spend his share just as speedily as
the old folks while having a hell of a lot more
fun doing it.
