! Erom Eneina comes the news lhat candi
dates lor freshman ofliees are being aided by
| signs and ]>osters. Doubtless the misguided
political enthusiasts responsible have already
been warned that such action is a flagrant
violation of one of tho most strictly observed
i of Stanford's few remaining traditions.
Stanford has played fast and loose with
traditions in the last few years. Many have
gone by the boards and rightly so. There is
i nothing more useless, more stultifying or
I more ridiculous than a worn-out tradition the
| reason for whose existence has long since been
I forgotten.
But when the motive for such observances
| is still understood, still obvious, and still valid,
j then they should he continued. That is the
' case with the custom of not advertising can
didates for student elections at Stanford. In
1 many cases the question of who was I<l be
] elected would resolve itself into a pure dollar
and cents proposition were posters, hand
bills, and the like used. Obviously this would
work a hardship on any student and on the
poorer individuals especially.
The argument lhat such methods are used
in real elections is not a valid one. There is
! practically nothing at stake in a student elee
| lion but the honor of the position and the
| honor is extremely doubtful if it is purchased
! by money.
Tammany methods, in the monetary sense
at least, have not yet invaded the Stanford
campus. This is no time to begin them. Watch
■ it, I'rosh!
