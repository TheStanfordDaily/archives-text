### JOHN McCLELLAND 
WITH FRANK WALTER WEYMOUTH
Making big headlines this week was the report that
Russian scientists had brought a man who had been
dead for three hours back to life by the use of an
artificial heart.
The report states that the scientists took a man who
had committed suicide by hanging himself and had
been dangling for three hours in their laboratory,
hooked up their pump to an artery and a vein and
started circulation again. He opened his eyes, so the
story goes, gazed about him briefly and then "expired
for the second time."
Immediately the question is raised: Is it physically
possible to restore life to a dead organism? If not,
what significance is there in the Russians' work?
Frank W. Weymouth, professor of physiology,
thinks the report to be a fantastically misleading tale
of what may be a truly noble experiment.
There are too many factors in this experiment that
have been overlooked in the report to make it justi
fiable to say that a dead man has been brought back
to life, Professor Weymouth believes.
Death itself must first be defined. Some claim
a person is dead when his heart has stopped beating.
If this is true, then in the case of suffocation it
might be possible to bring a person back to conscious
ness by starting up the blood flow again. But it would
have to be done quickly. Eight minutes after oxygen
is cut off from the central nervous system that par
ticular part of the body is permanently useless.
It is possible for the heart to cease beating and for
a large part of the tissue of the body to remain alive
for some time after. Thus it might be that some reflexes
might be made to react by artificial stimulation as long
as three hours after so-called "death."
Most scientists, however, consider death to be an
irreversable process where life is gone from every part
of the body with no possibility of bringing back life to
the dead tissues.
The pump used by the Russians is nothing new nor
is the principle they applied a new one, Weymouth
reveals. For many years experiments have been car
ried on with animals in which the blood has been kept
circulating even after the heart and lungs have been
removed.
It is obvious that the Russians can not hope to use
their pump to restore life. Their object is to make it
possible to "switch off the heart and lungs" and yet
keep up circulation during operation on those organs.
Almost insurmountable obstacles would be met in
such a practice, according to the physiology professor.
To stop the heart, as the Russians propose, and sub
stitute the artificial pump for the purpose of ail opera
tion would mean that the openings to the heart would
have to be clamped up and a large artery and vein
dipped. The danger of injury to these deligate parts
would be very great. Then a chemical to prevent
coagulation of blood would have to be introduced. But
it is probable that after the operation is over and the
effect of the chemical has worn off fatal coagulation
would take place. Blood clot in small blood vessels is
one of the dread phenomena of nature that man is
powerless to remedy.
Certainly the Russian "artificial heart" cannot
actually restore life. And its value in operations is
doubtful.

It is obvious that the Russians can not hope to use
their pump to restore life. Their object is to make it
possible to "switch off the heart and lungs" and yet
keep up circulation during operation on those organs.
Almost insurmountable obstacles would be met in
such a practice, according to the physiology professor.
To stop the heart, as the Russians propose, and sub
stitute the artificial pump for the purpose of ail opera
tion would mean that the openings to the heart would
have to be clamped up and a large artery and vein
dipped. The danger of injury to these deligate parts
would be very great. Then a chemical to prevent
coagulation of blood would have to be introduced. But
it is probable that after the operation is over and the
effect of the chemical has worn off fatal coagulation
would take place. Blood clot in small blood vessels is
one of the dread phenomena of nature that man is
powerless to remedy.
Certainly the Russian "artificial heart" cannot
actually restore life. And its value in operations is
doubtful.
WITH FRANK WALTER WEYMOUTH
Making big headlines this week was the report that
Russian scientists had brought a man who had been
dead for three hours back to life by the use of an
artificial heart.
The report states that the scientists took a man who
had committed suicide by hanging himself and had
been dangling for three hours in their laboratory,
hooked up their pump to an artery and a vein and
started circulation again. He opened his eyes, so the
story goes, gazed about him briefly and then "expired
for the second time."
Immediately the question is raised: Is it physically
possible to restore life to a dead organism? If not,
what significance is there in the Russians' work?
Frank W. Weymouth, professor of physiology,
thinks the report to be a fantastically misleading tale
of what may be a truly noble experiment.
There are too many factors in this experiment that
have been overlooked in the report to make it justi
fiable to say that a dead man has been brought back
to life, Professor Weymouth believes.
Death itself must first be defined. Some claim
a person is dead when his heart has stopped beating.
If this is true, then in the case of suffocation it
might be possible to bring a person back to conscious
ness by starting up the blood flow again. But it would
have to be done quickly. Eight minutes after oxygen
is cut off from the central nervous system that par
ticular part of the body is permanently useless.
It is possible for the heart to cease beating and for
a large part of the tissue of the body to remain alive
for some time after. Thus it might be that some reflexes
might be made to react by artificial stimulation as long
as three hours after so-called "death."
Most scientists, however, consider death to be an
irreversable process where life is gone from every part
of the body with no possibility of bringing back life to
the dead tissues.
The pump used by the Russians is nothing new nor
is the principle they applied a new one, Weymouth
reveals. For many years experiments have been car
ried on with animals in which the blood has been kept
circulating even after the heart and lungs have been
removed.
