The Editor, Sir:
Several days ago in one of my
more altruistic moods, I kindly low
ered myself to challenge you to a
grid combat, under the impression
that perhaps you Dailyites were
men enough to dare oppose the
robust Chappies. I now see that I
was wrong. You haven't changed a
mite —you still are a bunch of
fraidy-cats of the yellow variety.
Yah! and a couple of puffwoofs.
While stalling off our challenge, I
learn from my secret agents that you
have been approaching the high
school stars of Southern California
and th£ gorillas of South Africa in
an attempt to bolster your staff. I do
not object to your contacts with the
latter, since one can hardly distin
guish them from your staff, but
don't you dare contaminate the pure
high school children with your raids!
Ugh!
Now, kiddies of the Daily, will you
meet the gentlemen of the Chaparral
at 100 yards on November 10, or will
you reveal your true caliber by
slinking off behind your typewrit
ers?
In the spirit of condecension,
