# BULL SESSION

He smokes a big black seegar; he
wears a derby hat; he buys votes
and sells constituencies; he knows
everyone in the neighborhood by
his first name; he buys the kiddies
ice cream cones, fixes tags, and rakes
in the dough throughout the year.
No one will mistake. It is the ward
politician.
That is our picture of him. We
would spot him in an instant. Let
any poly sci major loose in the big
city, and he will go around nailing
this man for a heeler, that man for
a boss, and the little skinny guy as a
runner. How could it be otherwise?
The story books and newspapers
have done their work.
Not only is the political boss a
stereotype. The burglar, the hop
head, the Communist, the society
lady, the big-business-man, the
professor, the "good" date—all are
labelled, classified according to fore
heads, beards, clothes, and filed away
to be recognized forevel alter. These
handy little guides follow us through
life; we would be lost without them.
It simplifies things.
There is only one defect in the
system. It is hopelessly wrong. Un
fortunately, people cannot be classi
fied as readily as snakes, fruits, and
tools. A garter snake is always gar
tered and a chisel always chiseled.
But the politician is not always

HALLOWE'EN

! branded with the c'gar and derby;
the criminal does not always have
the low forehead; the professor is not
always verbose and stodgy. That,
again, is unfortunate. For though 1
people do not fit into stereotyped
molds, they are judged as if they
did. And it causes no end of trouble.
If the stock-waterer has pressed
| pants and a clean shirt, he is "re
, spectable." For pressed pants and
j clean shirts are part of the "respect- 1
! able" stereotypes. If the politician j
smokes English Ovals instead of |
dirty stogies, says "my friends" in
stead of "me buddies," and has
trigger-men to do the dirty work—
he is not only elected, but wor-
I shipped.
On the contrary, the "professor,"
because he bears the title and speaks
good English, is "visionary and im
practical." The wealthy man, be
cause he is such—and looks it —is
sneered at by an indiscriminate hoi
polloi.
All this continues. It explains
why people are duped, and double
duped; how people are prejudiced
and stuck with it.
We have been calling spades by so
many other names for so many years
that it is an unusual person who j
knows his little Casino.

good English, is "visionary and im

All this continues. It explains
why people are duped, and double

He smokes a big black seegar; he
wears a derby hat; he buys votes
and sells constituencies; he knows
everyone in the neighborhood by
his first name; he buys the kiddies
ice cream cones, fixes tags, and rakes
in the dough throughout the year.
No one will mistake. It is the ward
politician.
That is our picture of him. We
would spot him in an instant. Let
any poly sci major loose in the big
city, and he will go around nailing
this man for a heeler, that man for
a boss, and the little skinny guy as a
runner. How could it be otherwise?
The story books and newspapers
have done their work.
Not only is the political boss a
stereotype. The burglar, the hop
head, the Communist, the society
lady, the big-business-man, the
professor, the "good" date—all are
labelled, classified according to fore
heads, beards, clothes, and filed away
to be recognized forevel alter. These
handy little guides follow us through
life; we would be lost without them.

There is only one defect in the

the criminal does not always have

did. And it causes no end of trouble.
If the stock-waterer has pressed
