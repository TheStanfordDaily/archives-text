CARDS' FORGOTTEN
FOOTBALL PLAYERS

riIESE ALL-STAR
fEAMS ARE FUN

What's happened to Stanford's
orgotten men?
It seems that at one time Earl
loos, Ecf Lettunich, Lyle Smith,
3en Palamountain, and Rusty
Vlaino, not to mention Harry Carl
>on, Chuck White, and Fred Abbott,
-vere quite a bit talked about at one
irne.
They are still out for football.
Hoos is a good quarterback, but
ith Frank Alustiza and Stan An
ler.son both doing some work, Hoos
las had very little chance to show
lis abilities this year.
Smith, an alternate regular end
it the close of last football season,
las barely seen action this year.
Lettunich and Palamountain, who
started in regular berths as the 1933
ootball campaign was launched,
lave not been heard of since. Let
unich has worked as first reserve
ackle, but Palamountain has not
jeen in the game yet. He has not
ilayed since an injured knee early
ast year confined him to the side
ines for several weeks.
As compared to the men who
nake up the Stanford starting line
ip, these forgotten players are ob
viously not first-string material any
nore. But the first string does not
)lay all the game.

It's always fun to pick all-Amer
can, all-Coast, all-conference, and
>ther all-star football teams. And
t's usually good sport lor all you
jeople to pick them to pieces. So
lere goes.
This*is the sport staff's concep
ion of an all-Coast team, minus
Stanford players:
Ends — Erdelatz (St. Mary's),
Beseos (U.S.C.)
Tackles — Boone (California),
Theodoratus (Washington State).
Guards—Pechuc (San Fran
cisco), Boyer (U.C.L.A.).
Center—Sciniering (San Fran
cisco).
Quarterback —Goddard (Wash
ington State).
Halfbacks—Bufkin (Washington),
Nichelini (St. Mary's).
Fullback — Falaschi (Santa
Clara).
A bit premature, perhaps. With
Stanford included, the all-Coast
earn would include Grayson at full
)ack and Moscrip at Bescos' end.
But, although they probably will
lot be mentioned, Rouble and Ad
ims are on a par with the two
•uards that were given credit. Boone
md Theodoratus, similarly, are not
it all out of the class of Reynolds
md Callaway. Muller did not take
nything from Seimering when the
wo met at Kezar Stadium in San
Francisco two weeks ago, and Ham-
Iton and Alustiza really should ap
>ear somewhere in the backfield.
lowever, the Stanford line-up will
ppear in the news columns of to
lay's paper.
