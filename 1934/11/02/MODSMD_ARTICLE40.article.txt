# LOCAL FANS TREATED TO THREE-DAY GRIDIRON CARD
## 
### PHIL DUFFY 
While the Stanford Indian bends
jan ear toward the growl of the
| Little Bear of the South at Los An
, geles this Saturday and the Wash
ington Huskies plan a change of
i diet from Bear meat to Beaver meat
when they meet Oregon State at
j Seattle, bay football fans are turn
i ing their attention to the three-day
I football card presented them through
: the courtesy of St. Mary's vs. Wash
j ington State, California vs. Santa
| Clara, and U.S.F. vs. Gonzaga.
Holding the limelight this after
i noon in Kezar Stadium will be the
, Gaels and the Cougars in what
I promises to be a mighty close battle.
I The Madigan men just back from a
great victory over Fordham in New
j York will be hard pressed to win
| from this strong Washington State
[ team, who in a quiet and unassum-
I ing way are still entrenched at the
j top of the conference ladder with a
j strong possibility that they will re
| ceive an invitation to play in the j
Rose Bowl.
Famine Possible at Cal
The "no kissing, necking, or lip

tick" strike of the Berkeley coeds
is taking on the form of a down
right famine. A clause in the strike
decree states that the Golden Bears
have to win a conference game by
seven points to end the strike, and
this Saturday California meets Santa
Clara, a non-conference team. Win
oi' lose, the Bear men are still hold
ing the sack as far as getting dates
with the strikers. Santa Clara still
remains undefeated and betting
places them as favorites in tomor
row's game.
On Sunday Kezar will again play
host to football followers when the
Dons of San Francisco tangle with
the Gonzaga Bulldogs. This is an
other game where the outcome is a
toss-up, although Gonzaga's win
over Washington State places them
as a power in gridiron circles.
Frosh Battle J.C. Teams
The Card and Bear frosh teams
each take on a junior college team
in final preparations for their annual
Little Big Game next week-end.
The Calcubs play Glendale in a pre
liminary to the varsity game, and
the Indians meet Bakersfield here in
the Stanford oval.
In the north Oregon has somewhat
of a breather in their game with
Montana. And far to the south the
Trojan warhorse will spend the
week-end in patching holes the In
dian arrows made in his hide, mean
while laying plans to meet the in
vasion of the University *of Cali
fornia next week-end.
