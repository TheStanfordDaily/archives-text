# WATER POLOISTS HEAD SOUTHWARD
## 
### 
Ten Stanford varsity water polo- i
ists left by rail last night for Los j
Angeles, where their undefeated
record and their lead in the Pacific
Coast Conference will be seriously
threatened this afternoon.
With the U.C.L.A. Bruins, who
nearly upset the Cards in a near
slugfest in Encina pool two weeks
ago, as their first opponents, Nort
Thornton's paddlers may meet their
Waterloo at 3:30 o'clock in the
Westwood tank. Bobby Sellars, for
ward, and Dick Daubenspeck and
Bill Knox, guards, lead a Bruin
seven that will be more dangerous
than ever on its own stamping
grounds.
Stanford must face not only the
Uclans, but also U.S.C. in a return
game on this invasion. The latter
tilt will take place in the Trojan
pool at 11 o'clock tomorrow morn
ing. It should be an easy workout
after the Bruin struggle, unless the
Indians are weakened, since they
trounced the Trojans, 13 to 2, in
Encina pool a week ago.
The Cardinal aquatic stars proved
that they can click without one of j
their scoring aces when they whip
ped the Athens Club, 9 to 3, Wed
nesday night in Oakland. Leo Cook
rang up a total of six goais, but
Vlad Taranik had a severe cold and
did not play. Foster scored twice
and Sutherland once.
Since the junior varsity blanked
the Lakeside jayvees, 13 to 0, and
the Card frosh smothered Sequoia
High School under a 10-0 score here |
in a practice game yesterday, the
three Stanford aquatic teams have
compiled the enviable record of 32
goals scored to 3 for the opposition
in their last three games.
