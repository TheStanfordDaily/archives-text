# Three Mural Sports Fight For Spotlight
## NO FOOTBALL GAMES TODAY 
### 
Handball and golf shared the spot
light in intramural sports with
touch football yesterday, as returns
showed Phi Sigma Kappa defeated
Kappa Alpha, Forgers defeated En-
I cina Hashers, and Los Arcos de
feated Encina 2W on the links.
In the meantime Archie Zamloch
and Jerry Peters, representing
Delta Upsilon were beating Lloyd
Phillips and Harold Bell of El Toro;
and Sequoia I was handing a de
feat to the Fijis, all on the handball
courts.
While on the freshman fields El
Toro battled out a 6 to 0 triumph
over Delta Tau Delta, Menlo Juniors
nosed out the Fijis 7 to 0, and Se
iquoia I ran over the Kappa Sigs
33 to 0.
El Toro accounted for the only
score in the game with the Delts on
a pass, Marvie Kahn to Jim Triolo.
In their scoring splurge which
threatened the year's record of 46
| points run up by the Dekes, Se
quoia's most potent weapon was
; passing, Bill Ladue to Phil Cough
lan. This combination started under
way quickly with two touchdowns;
and two passes for touchdowns each,
Ladue to Russell mounted the score
to 26.
Ladue's interception of a Kappa
Sig pass late in the game, his run
; for a touchdown and Coghlan's con
version on a pass to Matthew
brought the final score to 33.
