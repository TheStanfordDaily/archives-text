# College Drivers Lauded By Paly Police Chief
## 
### ROBERT EISENBACH 
' Crazy college kids," anathema to
older automobilists, are not half as
crazy at the wheels of their cars as
their mothers, according to Howard
Kink, Palo Alto chief of police.
"Stanford students are among
our most law-abiding citizens," he
said. "Out of town women, usually
visiting mothers, are tagged most
often. Next in line come out-of
town men; Stanford men place third
on the list, and high schtfol students j
come fourth—the safest drivers of |
all."
The woman-driven sedan, which
glides by at 40 miles per hour, 1
though it appears to be doing only j
25, is much more of a menace than
the wheeziest fiiver covered with I
"kids," which can't go more than j
20 despite the fact that it appears to j

be setting a new record, he believes.
Among Stanford students the coed
drives faster than the "rough" al
most without exception. "Women
are naturally fast drivers," Chief
Zink declared, "although they pre
fer to believe that it is the men who
incline to road-burning. Our rec
ords show that more college women
are arrested in Palo Alto than men,
despite the discrepancies in num
bers enrolled."
"As for paying the fines—well," he
smiled, "we've got our own system.
College men either pay or work.
They have their choice of shelling
out some of dad's cash or chopping
wood at the Palo Alto Shelter for
the Unemployed at $1 per hour."
"Professors won't believe me, but
most of them prefer working."
