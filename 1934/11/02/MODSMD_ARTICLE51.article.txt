## 
### 
Rain has temporarily halted hos
tilities on the tennis courts, where
for the past few weeks three tour
naments: varsity, freshman, and
novice have been going on simulta
neously.
Bill Seward, second man of last
year's famous freshman team, per
formed the first upset when he de
feated the veteran Johnny Law,
seeded in the varsity tournament, in
straight sets: 7-5, 6-1.
This defeat is the first sign of the
battle Seward and his sophomore
partner, Ben Dey, are making to try
to move into the first two positions
<?n the varsity. Unlike the famous
sophomore football team of last
year, these two flashes haven't made
any spectacular vows, but they are
determined to move up as high as
they can on the ladder. They still
must reckon, however, with three
factors: former junior champion Jack
Lynch, Sammy Lee, and the come
back of John Law.
The Freshman Class Tournament
finds the favorites: Bob Underwood,
Bob Braly, Bob Colwell moving for
ward into the third round. These
three players at present are bidding
to be the nucleus of a freshman
team that may surpass that of last
year. Other winners in the second
round are: John Clifton, Walter
Ralphs, Henry Raider, Phil Bush,
and Leo Miller.
