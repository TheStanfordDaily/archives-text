# $75,000 BLAZE HITS LOWELL HI
## Incendiarism Suspected By Fire Chief Brennan 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 1 (TP).â€”
Damage estimated at $75,000 was
done to the Lowell High School
when an early morning fire today
raged through the third- iloor and
attic.
Firemen fought for more than an
hour and a halt' to extinguish the
blaze, which broke out in the upper
portion of the building and for a time
threatened its destruction.
Fear Prank
Fire Chief Charles Brennan ex
pressed the belief that the 1 lames
were of incendiary origin.
Firemen almost turned back from
the first call in the belief that it
was a false alarm Halowe'en prank
when they noticed the blaze near
the top of the building.
Crowd Calhers
Equipment from several parts of
the city centei'ed at the scene in
response to four alarms. The build
ing, under reconstruction, had not
been occupied for six months.
The school was built in 1912 at a
cost of $346,703.59. It was being re
constructed to make it "earthquake
proof."
A large crowd quickly gathered,
and police were drawn up to keep
the spectators at a safe distance.
