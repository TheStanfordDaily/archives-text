# Liquor Sale Permit Of Palo Alto Store Cancelled by Court
## Mayfield, Menlo Parks Also Named in Boundaries Of 1 1/2-Mile Zone 
### 
Upholding the penal code section
regarding the sale of liquor in Palo
Alto, the California Supreme Court
Friday ordered cancellation of the
permit for the sale of hard liquors
that was granted to the California
Avenue Pharmacy by the State
Board of Equalization.
The court ruling, which states that
the mile-and-a-half protective zone
should be measured from the "cam
pus limit and by a direct and straight
line," effects not only Palo Alto and
Mayfield but also Menlo Park. By
the same ruling that orders the can
cellation of the California Phar
macy's license most of "the Menlo
Park dealers may be deprived of
theirs, according to an opinion given
by the supreme court.
Seeks Rehearing
Through legal council, Stanford
University asked the supreme court
to approve a petition granting a
rehearing of the controversy. As
soon as the petition was approved,
briefs were submitted to the supreme
court justices by Stanford Univer
sity and the State Board of Equali
zation.
On the advice of City Attorney Ar
nold Rumwell, who said that the
Board of Equalization had no right
to alter the penal code section re
garding liquor sales in Palo Alto, the
police department refused to permit
the sale of hard liquors within the
mile-and-a-half zone unless the
Board of Equalization's rulings was
upheld by the supreme court.
Court Issues Rule
The ruling of the State Supreme
Court follows:
"We are of the opinion that the
license issued by the respondent
State Board of Equalization to the
California Avenue Pharmacy to sell
intoxicating liquor in Palo Alto and
within a mile-and-a-half of the
grounds and campus of Leland
Stanford Junior University should
be cancelled and annulled, that a writ
of mandate be issued -forthwith -re
quiring the respondent State Board
of Equalization to cancel and annul
the same.
"We are of the view that the dis
tance is to be measured from the
campus limit and by a direct and
straight line. The authorities sup
port that view and command it to
our consideration and acceptance."
(The authorities are similar cases in
Massachusetts, lowa, and District of
Columbia.)
Beer Not Affected
Selling of 3.2 beer in Palo Alto
is not affected by this ruling, which
deals only with intoxicating bever
ages.
City Attorney Rumwell expressed
great satisfaction when news of the
court ruling was received. "The city
situation is now cleared up and we
are well satisfied. The decision,
while primarily affecting the Cali
fornia Avenue Pharmacy, naturally
extends to any other liquor selling
place within the state mile-and-a
half distance from the University
grounds."
