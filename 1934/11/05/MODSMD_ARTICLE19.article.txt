# Thornton to Bring Plays
## 
### 
William Thornton, the young Cali
fornia tragedian, returns to the Farm
on Wednesday, November 14, with
his caravan of Shakespearean artists,
to present two of the bard's plays,
"The Taming of the Shrew" and
"King Lear."
The majority of the players, the
star included, are young; only two
are over 30 and there are four under
21. Their youthful attitude is ap
parent in their approach to the
traditionalized plays of Shake
speare; their acting is not the stiff
and stilted conventional kind, but
the vigorous and vital modern man
ner.
Thornton himself attended Stan
ford for several years It was during
those years that he first in
terested in drama. While on the
Farm he played in "Macbeth" and
was Poloniu.s in the modern-dress
version of "Hamlet."
Included in the cast are Robert
Brauns and Frances Slanina, well
known to University audiences.
