# Banging Pipes, Siren Are Features of Plant Duties

Without the early morning siren
to awaken slumberers and to warn
those already awake and eating that
eight o'clocks are but 15 minutes off,
the campus would be slightly at a
loss.
Yet Stanford is hardly aware it
owes the University's central heat
ing plant, for • the puffs of steam
blasting through the pipes across
from Encina Gym to give each Stan
ford day a noisy inauguration.
More important of the steam
plant's duties is to heat every Uni
versity controlled building on the
campus with the 1400 horsepower of
steam generated continually by each
of five boilers.
Created by burning natural gas,

the steam issues through large pipes
to the Quad, the halls, and outlying
buildings through an underground
tunnel system.
Starting at the generating plant
near Encina Gym, the steam is piped
underground to a point between the
art gallery and library, where a large
tunnel is hit which a man may fol
low standing up. In places the tun
nel is seven feet high.
Encina, according to superintend
ent of the steam plant, Jack McGlin,
gets more of the hoi air than any
place. To accommodate campus
kitchens, McGlin says, heat i.s turned
on at 4 a.m. However, knocking of
the steam radiator pipes does not
reach its highest pitch until around
6:45, hall slumberers testify.
