After a high pressure political
campaign that rivaled the current
gubernatorial race and shocked
sponsors and old timers wher can
didates started passing out printed
Cdidt>, Juhii Curran was elected
president of the class of '38, with 78
votes; and Guy Haggerty, secretary
treasurer with 83 votes, in fresh
man class election Friday. Ken
Peters trailed Curran by 22 votes,
while Jacqueline Brown pressed
Haggerty with 79 votes.
Covering Encina Hall as thorough
ly as a laundry agent does on Mon
day nights, the ward heelers posted
signs, passed out handbills, and dec
orated automobiles in their zeal to
get their men elected. Some of the
signs read: "Vote for 'so-and-so'—
he was student body president for
two years in high school."
Sponsors can remember the situa
tion last year when there was not
enough politcial excitement in the
class of '37 to nominate an Encina
Club president for the second half of
the year, and find it hard to explain
the present phenomenon.
The contest was very close, ac
cording to A.S.S.U. Election Chair
man John Brock, second choices,
being necessary to decide the win
ners.
