# Party Visits Bridge Pier
## 
### 
As a result of the many hearings
before the building committee of the
Golden Gate Bridge, at which Dr.
Bailey Willis, professor emeritus of
geology, claimed the south pier
foundations were being built upon
insecure rock, the committee and Dr.
Willis made a field trip to the shore
near the site of excavations last
Saturday afternoon.
The trip was made so that Dr.
Willis and Professor Andrew C.
Lawson of Berkeley, who claims the
foundations are secure, might com
pare notes at the actual site of the
dispute. Dr. Willis claims that the
sandstone strain which can be seen
along shore runs out under the site
of the pier and that the pier should
be built upon the sandstone as a
foundation rather than the overlay
ing serpentine upon which it is
planned to build it at present.
No decision was reached as a re
sult of the trip, and further meet
ings will be called at the pleasure
of the chairman. Francis V. Keesling.
