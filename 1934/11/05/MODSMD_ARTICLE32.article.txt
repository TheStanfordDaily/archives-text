# Stanford Releases New Power, Speed In Easy Uclan Win
## Score of 27 to 0 Surprises As Cards Push Over Bruin Eleven 
### Millard Browne 
Eleven tired Stanford football
players are preparing for an on
slaught of Washington Huskies this
week after barely sneaking through
with a victory over the "little sister"
of the 'Coast Conference in gridiron
combat Saturday, as the Indians won
over U.C.L.A. by a score of . . .
Hold everythingâ€”We took the
wrong lead out of the files. That
was just the way it was figured.
Here's how it happened.
Stanford completely smothered a
fighting Bruin team, 27 to 0, in Olym
pic Stadium before 60,000 fans,
40,000 of which were hoping to see
the undefeated Cardinals toppled.
In doing so, Stanford hit a new
peak of smoothness, perfection of
timing, and powerful driving, and
the Indians looked Saturday as if
they could take on and overwhelm
any team the Rose Bowl committee
should happen to choose, and do it
today.
So complete was the rout that the
Cardinal second string played dur
ing the last quartei; and made a
scoring drive, using only straight
power, through the Bruin line that
held California to a 3 to 0 score two
weeks ago.
Stanford Clicks
It was a simple case of clicking.
The individual stars were there, but
they gave way much glory as the
entire eleven put itself together for
this new Indian peak.
So now Stanford is ready for
Washington, and the poor old Cali
fornia Golden Bear, and anyone
else who wants to play football.
From the standpoint of scoring
points, it was Grayson day again.
Fullback Bobby accounted for two
touchdowns, Bones Hamilton added
one, and Chuck Ledbetter did the
carrying for the second team. Monk
Moscrip's three attempts at con
versions were all good.
Stanford started marching early
and finished late. The Indians, for
getting old conservative habits of
sizing up the opposition in the first
quarter, took advantage of the rad
ical environment and began driving
when they received the opening kick.
In the first minute of play Van
Dellen had romped up to the
Uclans' 48-yard line, and two more
plays, with Grayson carrying the
ball, put the Cardinals in a threaten
ing position on the 30-yard stripe.
The Bruins held, Stanford fumbled
and recovered, and Alustiza kicked.
Then, but a few moments later,
Stanford .started her scoring drive
in earnest. Van Dellen took a punt
to the Bruin 42, and Grayson added
14 yards to the 28. He fumbled and
Hamilton recovered for a 13-yard
loss, and Grayson passed to Monk
Moscrip for a first down on the
U.C.L.A. 10-yard line.
Grayson bucked to the six and
then to the four, and another bad
break, which would have threatened
to demoralize many teams, hit the
Indians when they were penalized
for offside. But in one play Grayson
took the bull for the entire nine
yards to a touchdown over right
tackle. Monk Moscrip added the
point.
Gun Halts Cards
That was all the scoring there
was during the first half. But that
fact can be blamed on the timer, nol
Stanford or U.C.L.A. The gun
sounded with Stanford in possession,
third down, on the two-yard line of
the Blue and Gold.
It was along toward the end of
the third quarter that the game's
aspect discarded the expected hue
of a Stanford eleven sneaking
through with a bare victory, and took
on the appearance 'of a driving,
punching group of champions in
action against a second rate team.
' Moscrip and Keith Topping started
I the parade when they blocked a
! Bruin punt and the ball rolled out of
bounds on the U.C.L.A. 36. With
good blocking, Grayson took quick
advantage and slashed to the 21 on
two plays. Then Hamilton came into
the picture and slithered through on
j a reverse to the eight-yard line.
Van Dellen added his bit and laid
the ball on the six-inch line on the
fourth play of this 36-yard spurt.
Grayson easily went over, and Mos
i crip again place-kicked true.
It was only two plays later that the
third Cardinal score, the only "fluke"
pay-off of the game, found its way to
I the gridiron history books. Big Bob
Reynolds kicked off. The Bruins
passed. Hamilton took that pass by
I interception on his own 45 and
1 snake-hipped behind perfect inter
i ference through a group of evil
! intending but ineffective Bruins for
j55 yards and another touchdown,
i Moscrip was still in the game. Score
; 21 to 0.
Seconds Score
It was the Bruins' turn to become
demoralized. And they did, to the
I extent that Stanford's seconds found
little difficulty in smashing over for
the fourth touchdown of the day.
j Ledbetter featured in a drive, from
| the 20-yard line and went over from
j the one on a line play. Reisner's
' attempted extra point from place
j ment was blocked.
