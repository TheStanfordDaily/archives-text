# Honor Societies? Some Are, Most Are Not
## 
### 
Webster has defined honor as "a token of
esteem paid to worth." At Stanford and at
;ilI eolleges there exist so-called honor soci
eties which labor under the delusion that
membership in their organization constitutes
"a token of esteem paid to worth."
One who looks at such groups dispassion
ately, however, is forced to the conclusion that
the only relation they bear to "worth" is that
you have to be worth a lot of dough to pay
the initiation fee to one ol the darned things.
And as far as "esteem" is concerned, the only
people holding them in esteem are the mem
bers themselves. The fact is, the more intel
ligent members probably also wonder what
it's all about.
To avoid misinterpretation, it is worth
pointing out that there are honor societies
and honor societies. Some are honor societies
only because they choose to call themselves
that. Others are honor societies because out
siders as well as members recognize that it
is a distinction to belong to them. Those that
choose their members because of outstanding
academic work or prominence in some speci
fied activity are, in the main, legitimate or
ganizations.
There are others, however, that exist only
to feed their self-esteem and justify such ex
istence by an unfortunately all-inclusive and
meaningless term: "honor." They elect offi
cers, they sometimes hold meetings, but above
all, they pay dues. Such organizations are
hollow shells, tottering on the brink of obliv
ion. It behooves Ex Committee to give them
the gentle shove that will remove their use
less presence from campus affairs.
