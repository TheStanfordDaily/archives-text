Many good hooks in the library and several
good courses in Ihe University are a part of
what is known as "Stanford."
Some read because they like to read; others
because midquarter examinations make the
doing a practical necessity; a few because they
are :il a loss to occupy the passing time. Some
enroll in a given 'course of study because of a
special interest in the work; others out of
mild curiosity and a desire to "learn some
thing"; many in the hope of finding a so-called
"pipe"; a few because that certain number
of units derived from satisfactory work in
said course of study will help keep them in
school.
How many students, though, regardless of
the above classification, actually are on speak
ing terms (that is, outside <>t the classroom)
with their professors? Are there more than a
mere handful who, until the end of their
collegiate career, really begin to know their
faculty friends as anything more than class
room necessities?
The prerequisite of any lecture course is,
naturally, an able instructor. And, at the
end of the customary performance, the
speaker of the day (every day) remarks that
the show is over, removes the spectacles, folds
voluminous notes, to depart for the moment.
Occasionally, one or two students will march
to the head of the elasroom and ask a couple
of questions. These individuals are branded
frequently as "apple polishers," if the prac
tice becomes noticeable enough to excite
com inent.
It is too bad that every class can't possibly
be just one big bull-session between professor
and students. It is a shame that the two
groups can't get together more olten outside
of the classroom. It is disappointing that more
students don't have the slightest idea of what
their professors think and do beyond the
Quad. It is unfortunate that more professors
do not encourage undergraduates in this re
spect. Most of them do, to some extent, but
freshmen and sophomores spend two years
groping in many cases before they begin to
catch on.
Stanford is noted for an able faculty, stu
dents selected for academic ability. Make it
part of your life on I he campus, beginning this
morning, to bring those two groups closer
together. Stick around alter the hour is over,
ask all the questions you want, and really
r/ijotj scholastic Stanford.

doing a practical necessity; a few because they
are :il a loss to occupy the passing time. Some
enroll in a given 'course of study because of a
special interest in the work; others out of
mild curiosity and a desire to "learn some
thing"; many in the hope of finding a so-called
"pipe"; a few because that certain number
of units derived from satisfactory work in
said course of study will help keep them in
school.
How many students, though, regardless of
the above classification, actually are on speak
ing terms (that is, outside <>t the classroom)
with their professors? Are there more than a
mere handful who, until the end of their
collegiate career, really begin to know their
faculty friends as anything more than class
room necessities?
The prerequisite of any lecture course is,
naturally, an able instructor. And, at the
end of the customary performance, the
speaker of the day (every day) remarks that
the show is over, removes the spectacles, folds
voluminous notes, to depart for the moment.
Occasionally, one or two students will march
to the head of the elasroom and ask a couple
of questions. These individuals are branded
frequently as "apple polishers," if the prac
tice becomes noticeable enough to excite
com inent.
It is too bad that every class can't possibly
be just one big bull-session between professor
and students. It is a shame that the two
groups can't get together more olten outside
of the classroom. It is disappointing that more
students don't have the slightest idea of what
their professors think and do beyond the
Quad. It is unfortunate that more professors
do not encourage undergraduates in this re
spect. Most of them do, to some extent, but
freshmen and sophomores spend two years
groping in many cases before they begin to
catch on.
Stanford is noted for an able faculty, stu
dents selected for academic ability. Make it
part of your life on I he campus, beginning this
morning, to bring those two groups closer
together. Stick around alter the hour is over,
ask all the questions you want, and really
r/ijotj scholastic Stanford.
