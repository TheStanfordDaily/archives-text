with nil the enthusiastic bombast Californians
customarily generate in any kind of reforma
tory campaign. Five students were peremp
torily dismissed at U.C.L.A. and the editor
of Santa Clara's weekly publication has been
expelled.
The mortality rate of college editors, inci
dentally, is fairly high <»n the Pacific Coast
this year, as the I'niversity of Oregon Emerald
editor found himself relieved of duty several
weeks ago.
And the Inst thrust, emanating from the
oflices of the State Superintendent of Schools,
is the requirement that all students of State
colleges give their pledge to support the Con
stitution and to refrain from any subversive
actions aimed against the authorities.
Leaving entirely aside the right and wrong
of Communism, the possibilities .of its aim,
ideals, and methods, we question if the honest
leaders of education in this Slate are not, by
virtue of their oratory, blowing up a bevy
of imaginary gasbags; the which to later ex
ploit, denounce, and puncture with profit and
honor to themselves?
The fact remains, that no authority seems
able to levy any charges of violence or clear
cut "un-American" acts against these pur
ported radicals. No one has flung bombs;
no one lias harangued the rabble with impre
cations against the government; no threats
have been enunciated; no skulls have been
disclosed; no one has trampled the Hag in the
dirt, committed murder or arson, or sung the
Internationale.
If these things have been done, no one has
taken the trouble to specify them. The "Com
munistic" activities apparently are confined
to spreading of handbills (which should be
called to the attention of the street cleaning
departments rather than to college presi
dents); denunciation of war; and the plan
ning of political forums which were never
held.
Nothing but generalities have been staled;
and college students nowadays are commonly
indicted with impatience for generalities. Fur
ther, their political convictions trend irrecon
cilably toward the right, as the evidence in
recent straw votes both on this campus and
at Berkeley indicates.
If the California educators are sincerely
afraid of an outburst of Communism, lei them
attack the problems of economic rehabilita
tion and the provision of jobs. A job is the
best insurance man ever devised against mal
contents; if a college student were listening
to a Communistic speech and you showed
him where he could gel a job, he would linger
at the meeting no longer.
Ah, well, Slalinskv, my beard and bomb,

And the Inst thrust, emanating from the
oflices of the State Superintendent of Schools,
is the requirement that all students of State
colleges give their pledge to support the Con
stitution and to refrain from any subversive
actions aimed against the authorities.
Leaving entirely aside the right and wrong
of Communism, the possibilities .of its aim,
ideals, and methods, we question if the honest
leaders of education in this Slate are not, by
virtue of their oratory, blowing up a bevy
of imaginary gasbags; the which to later ex
ploit, denounce, and puncture with profit and
honor to themselves?
The fact remains, that no authority seems
able to levy any charges of violence or clear
cut "un-American" acts against these pur
ported radicals. No one has flung bombs;
no one lias harangued the rabble with impre
cations against the government; no threats
have been enunciated; no skulls have been
disclosed; no one has trampled the Hag in the
dirt, committed murder or arson, or sung the
Internationale.
If these things have been done, no one has
taken the trouble to specify them. The "Com
munistic" activities apparently are confined
to spreading of handbills (which should be
called to the attention of the street cleaning
departments rather than to college presi
dents); denunciation of war; and the plan
ning of political forums which were never
held.
Nothing but generalities have been staled;
and college students nowadays are commonly
indicted with impatience for generalities. Fur
ther, their political convictions trend irrecon
cilably toward the right, as the evidence in
recent straw votes both on this campus and
at Berkeley indicates.
If the California educators are sincerely
afraid of an outburst of Communism, lei them
attack the problems of economic rehabilita
tion and the provision of jobs. A job is the
best insurance man ever devised against mal
contents; if a college student were listening
to a Communistic speech and you showed
him where he could gel a job, he would linger
at the meeting no longer.
