## SINCLAIR—THE CAMPAIGN 
### CROMPTON BANCS, Jr 
This is fundamentally a campaign between the
Haves and the Have-Nots. Less accurately it is a
contest between the employed and the unemployed.
In this kind of fight anything goes. The Haves are
likely to do more hitting below the belt as they have
everything to lose and nothing to gain.
The Sinclair-Merriam race is probably the first of
many contests between the Haves and the Have-Nots;
that's why it is attracting more attention than any
other state campaign in our history. Let's see just
what has been going on.
In the first placc the relative strength of the
two sides is pretty much of an unknown quantity.
Slightly over three million Californians are eli
gible to vote; (here are a few more Democrats
than Republicans, but this doesn't mean that all
the Democrats will vote for Sinclair nor all the
Republicans for Merriam. It's probably a safe
bet to say that each can count on a million votes
from his own party; the million-odd voles left
over will tell the tale on November G.
For the first time the Literary Digest poll is likely
to be inaccurate; at present it shows Merriam leading
about 3 to 2. But the people voting are mostly those
in phone books and city directories. It is admitted that
many of Sinclair's supporters do not have phones, so
the poll probably exaggerates Merriam's strength. It's
safer to call it 50-50 and go on to campaign tactics.
As I said before, anything goes. Hollywood movie
studios—mainly MGM (headed by Louis B. Mayer,
G.O.P. power) have been manufacturing fake news
reels showing upstanding citizens declaring for Mer
riam and lousy bums with ten-day beards for Sinclaix - .
Many last-ditch "Save California" organizations
have been formed. These have spent almost a million
dollars in villifying Sinclair, EPIC, and all their works
on billboards, in newspapers and on the radio. In
England this would be ungentlemanly and is pun
ished by strict libel laws with prison the usual sen
tence. Here it is taken as a matter of course for
anything goes.
Another example: Sinclair's past writings have
been unearthed, well edited and sent where they
would do him the most harm. Excerpts from the
"Profits of Religion"' have been mailed to most
church-goers; the Parent-Teachers' Associations
have been well circularized, etc.
Only one sizeable newspaper supports Sinclair in
any way. The L. A. News (daily tabloid) at least tries
to be impartial. The others use varying degrees of
strong language in condemning him. The best reports
on the situation arc usually found in New York news
papers—3ooo miles away.
To fight this, Sinclair forces organized the EPIC
distributed weekly all over Ihe state. Impartial
estimates credit it with a million and a quarter cir
culation. It naturally presents only the EPIC side, but
after all, that's just what the others arc doing.
There has never been such hysteria in California.
Business houses are telling their employees to vote
for Merriam or lose their jobs; contracts are even
being made with cancellation clauses in case Sinclair
is elected. The president of a university well-known
in the past, for its football teams was heard to remark:
"This campaign can no longer be waged on political
grounds; it is now a question of religion and morals."
This is exactly what it shouldn't be. This cam
paign is the biggest question in polilics California
has ever had; there is no question at all of re
ligion and morals. The one question is whether
the state will have a conservative or a radical
government. That should be (he only issue.
So for the first time California is to have an election
between ihe Haves and the Have-Nots. There will
probably be many more to come.

Tomorrow: Sinclair and flu- Onnorrntir I'jirly

ished by strict libel laws with prison the usual sen
tence. Here it is taken as a matter of course for
anything goes.
Another example: Sinclair's past writings have
been unearthed, well edited and sent where they
would do him the most harm. Excerpts from the
"Profits of Religion"' have been mailed to most
church-goers; the Parent-Teachers' Associations
have been well circularized, etc.
Only one sizeable newspaper supports Sinclair in
any way. The L. A. News (daily tabloid) at least tries
to be impartial. The others use varying degrees of
strong language in condemning him. The best reports
on the situation arc usually found in New York news
papers—3ooo miles away.
To fight this, Sinclair forces organized the EPIC
distributed weekly all over Ihe state. Impartial
estimates credit it with a million and a quarter cir
culation. It naturally presents only the EPIC side, but
after all, that's just what the others arc doing.
There has never been such hysteria in California.
Business houses are telling their employees to vote
for Merriam or lose their jobs; contracts are even
being made with cancellation clauses in case Sinclair
is elected. The president of a university well-known
in the past, for its football teams was heard to remark:
"This campaign can no longer be waged on political
grounds; it is now a question of religion and morals."
This is exactly what it shouldn't be. This cam
paign is the biggest question in polilics California
has ever had; there is no question at all of re
ligion and morals. The one question is whether
the state will have a conservative or a radical
government. That should be (he only issue.
So for the first time California is to have an election
between ihe Haves and the Have-Nots. There will
probably be many more to come.

Tomorrow: Sinclair and flu- Onnorrntir I'jirly
This is fundamentally a campaign between the
Haves and the Have-Nots. Less accurately it is a
contest between the employed and the unemployed.
In this kind of fight anything goes. The Haves are
likely to do more hitting below the belt as they have
everything to lose and nothing to gain.
The Sinclair-Merriam race is probably the first of
many contests between the Haves and the Have-Nots;
that's why it is attracting more attention than any
other state campaign in our history. Let's see just
what has been going on.
In the first placc the relative strength of the
two sides is pretty much of an unknown quantity.
Slightly over three million Californians are eli
gible to vote; (here are a few more Democrats
than Republicans, but this doesn't mean that all
the Democrats will vote for Sinclair nor all the
Republicans for Merriam. It's probably a safe
bet to say that each can count on a million votes
from his own party; the million-odd voles left
over will tell the tale on November G.
For the first time the Literary Digest poll is likely
to be inaccurate; at present it shows Merriam leading
about 3 to 2. But the people voting are mostly those
in phone books and city directories. It is admitted that
many of Sinclair's supporters do not have phones, so
the poll probably exaggerates Merriam's strength. It's
safer to call it 50-50 and go on to campaign tactics.
As I said before, anything goes. Hollywood movie
studios—mainly MGM (headed by Louis B. Mayer,
G.O.P. power) have been manufacturing fake news
reels showing upstanding citizens declaring for Mer
riam and lousy bums with ten-day beards for Sinclaix - .
Many last-ditch "Save California" organizations
have been formed. These have spent almost a million
dollars in villifying Sinclair, EPIC, and all their works
on billboards, in newspapers and on the radio. In
England this would be ungentlemanly and is pun
ished by strict libel laws with prison the usual sen
tence. Here it is taken as a matter of course for
anything goes.
