# CAMPUS OPINION
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
With the freshman elections just
over, a fact has come to my atten
tion which I think should be brought
to the attention of the rest of the
Stanford students. This is the de- \
plorable commercialism that was !
apparent in this election.
For several days prior to the elec- \
tion, Encina Hal} was so flooded j
with hand bills urging the frosh to |
vote for this and that candidate that
the dormitory began to resemble -
Golden Gate Park just after the 14th !
Republican Assembly District's An- !
nual Picnic.
Since the offices in question are
positions of honor and not in the
least way remunerative does it not
seem reasonable and logical that the
competition for these offices should
be on an honorable basis and pro
visions should be made to prohibit i
the expenditure of money for such
elections?
Certainly no one can deny that a
capable candidate is one who can
secure the election by himself by |
demonstration of his ability through
personal contacts and' observation
by his fellow students: Such a
candidate will -represent the free [
choice of the majority of students i
instead of the result of clever sub- j
terfuge by a small minority that of- |
fers nothing but nebulous words j
and empty phrases. • , I

The Editor, Sir: • .
•It seems grossly unfair that just
because a student loSes his student j
body card he is deprived of all game !
privileges. About 15 of us are in j
this unfortunate position and are
told that we will not be able to I
purchase rooters' tickets for the Big j
Game, or be permitted to see the J
Washington game.
The Administration and the j
B.A.C. play shuttle-cock with the j
alibi. Dean Culver says that the |
Administration cannot issue new!
cards to the game.
Meanwhilie, the student, who has j
payed $114 for his privileges, is de- j
prived of valuable rights simply be- j
cause of the loss of the receipt. If !
it is an effort to issue new cards on
the part of the University, those
deprived would be willing, I'm sure,
to pay a reasonable fine for that
effort. Can't something be done
about this situation?

The Editor, Sir:
I write this* in behalf of my fellow j
frosh. When you wilfully, and with j
malice of forethought, brought to
bear upon us your all too active
typewriter, you failed to remember .
that we probably know nothing!
about Stanford traditions as far as
campaigning is concerned. I be
lieve I am correct in saying that
there was no passage in the "Bible" j
that warned us* against "Playing fast i
and loose with Stanford traditions" j
and consequently I see no obvious
reason under the sun for "jumping
all over us" and issuing warnings.
I do not believe in working against
Stanford rules and regulations, but
I do believe that we should get a [
"break."
I know that you will take this let
ter in the spirit in which it is written
and will hold no grudge against the
author. Also, if you do print this,
do me the favor of correcting the
spelling, punctuation, and gram
mar. I realize that I cannot hope
to compete with the very excel
lent and praiseworthy writers of
your humble newspaper,

The Editor, Sir:
Perhaps this letter may seem j
biased, but 1 am stating the follow- j
ing comment from the opinions of j
others as well as from my own.
I have read with disgust the busy- j
body editorials as published by the i
Daily, and also the pro-U.C.L.A.
articles by the estimable Mr. Mel
linkoff, who happens to have at- |
tended the University in question.:
Might I ask what satisfaction the j
Daily derives in defending the rad- I
ical political activities of another
University?
I am aware that an intense interest j
has been taken in the U.C.L.A. situa
tion, but that doesn't warrant the
decided stand which has been taken j
in favor of the ousted students.
Perhaps they did not deserve their
fate, perhaps they are innocent. On
the other hand, U.C.L.A. and Los
Angeles are hotbeds of Radicalism, |
Socialism, and Communism.
It seems to me that the Daily held
an election poll about the election
which showed the majority of the
students to be opposed to Socialism,
and it follows, opposed to Commun- i
ism.

in favor of the ousted students.
Perhaps they did not deserve their
fate, perhaps they are innocent. On
the other hand, U.C.L.A. and Los

It seems to me that the Daily held
an election poll about the election
which showed the majority of the

ism.
The Editor, Sir:
With the freshman elections just
over, a fact has come to my atten
tion which I think should be brought
to the attention of the rest of the
Stanford students. This is the de- \
plorable commercialism that was !
apparent in this election.
For several days prior to the elec- \
tion, Encina Hal} was so flooded j
with hand bills urging the frosh to |
vote for this and that candidate that
the dormitory began to resemble -
Golden Gate Park just after the 14th !
Republican Assembly District's An- !
nual Picnic.
Since the offices in question are
positions of honor and not in the
least way remunerative does it not
seem reasonable and logical that the
competition for these offices should
be on an honorable basis and pro
visions should be made to prohibit i
the expenditure of money for such
elections?
Certainly no one can deny that a
capable candidate is one who can
secure the election by himself by |
demonstration of his ability through
personal contacts and' observation
by his fellow students: Such a
candidate will -represent the free [
choice of the majority of students i
instead of the result of clever sub- j
terfuge by a small minority that of- |
fers nothing but nebulous words j
and empty phrases. • , I

because a student loSes his student j

privileges. About 15 of us are in j
this unfortunate position and are
told that we will not be able to I
purchase rooters' tickets for the Big j

I write this* in behalf of my fellow j
frosh. When you wilfully, and with j
malice of forethought, brought to
bear upon us your all too active
typewriter, you failed to remember .
that we probably know nothing!
about Stanford traditions as far as
campaigning is concerned. I be
lieve I am correct in saying that
there was no passage in the "Bible" j
that warned us* against "Playing fast i
and loose with Stanford traditions" j
and consequently I see no obvious
reason under the sun for "jumping
all over us" and issuing warnings.
I do not believe in working against
Stanford rules and regulations, but
I do believe that we should get a [
"break."
I know that you will take this let
ter in the spirit in which it is written

do me the favor of correcting the

Daily, and also the pro-U.C.L.A.
articles by the estimable Mr. Mel
linkoff, who happens to have at- |
tended the University in question.:
Might I ask what satisfaction the j
Daily derives in defending the rad- I
ical political activities of another
University?
I am aware that an intense interest j
has been taken in the U.C.L.A. situa
tion, but that doesn't warrant the
decided stand which has been taken j
in favor of the ousted students.
Perhaps they did not deserve their
fate, perhaps they are innocent. On
the other hand, U.C.L.A. and Los
Angeles are hotbeds of Radicalism, |
Socialism, and Communism.
It seems to me that the Daily held
an election poll about the election
which showed the majority of the
students to be opposed to Socialism,
and it follows, opposed to Commun- i
ism.
The Editor, Sir:
With the freshman elections just
over, a fact has come to my atten
tion which I think should be brought
to the attention of the rest of the
Stanford students. This is the de- \
plorable commercialism that was !
apparent in this election.
For several days prior to the elec- \
tion, Encina Hal} was so flooded j
with hand bills urging the frosh to |
vote for this and that candidate that
the dormitory began to resemble -
Golden Gate Park just after the 14th !
Republican Assembly District's An- !
nual Picnic.
Since the offices in question are
positions of honor and not in the
least way remunerative does it not
seem reasonable and logical that the
competition for these offices should
be on an honorable basis and pro
visions should be made to prohibit i
the expenditure of money for such
elections?
Certainly no one can deny that a
capable candidate is one who can
secure the election by himself by |
demonstration of his ability through
personal contacts and' observation
by his fellow students: Such a
candidate will -represent the free [
choice of the majority of students i
instead of the result of clever sub- j
terfuge by a small minority that of- |
fers nothing but nebulous words j
and empty phrases. • , I

The Editor, Sir: • .
•It seems grossly unfair that just
because a student loSes his student j
body card he is deprived of all game !
privileges. About 15 of us are in j
this unfortunate position and are
told that we will not be able to I
purchase rooters' tickets for the Big j
Game, or be permitted to see the J
Washington game.
The Administration and the j
B.A.C. play shuttle-cock with the j
alibi. Dean Culver says that the |
Administration cannot issue new!
cards to the game.
Meanwhilie, the student, who has j
payed $114 for his privileges, is de- j
prived of valuable rights simply be- j
cause of the loss of the receipt. If !
it is an effort to issue new cards on
the part of the University, those
deprived would be willing, I'm sure,
to pay a reasonable fine for that
effort. Can't something be done
about this situation?
Henry Brill ;
The Editor, Sir:
I write this* in behalf of my fellow j
frosh. When you wilfully, and with j
malice of forethought, brought to
bear upon us your all too active
typewriter, you failed to remember .
that we probably know nothing!
about Stanford traditions as far as
campaigning is concerned. I be
lieve I am correct in saying that
there was no passage in the "Bible" j
that warned us* against "Playing fast i
and loose with Stanford traditions" j
and consequently I see no obvious
reason under the sun for "jumping
all over us" and issuing warnings.
I do not believe in working against
Stanford rules and regulations, but
I do believe that we should get a [
"break."
I know that you will take this let
ter in the spirit in which it is written
and will hold no grudge against the
author. Also, if you do print this,
do me the favor of correcting the
spelling, punctuation, and gram
mar. I realize that I cannot hope
to compete with the very excel
lent and praiseworthy writers of
your humble newspaper,
