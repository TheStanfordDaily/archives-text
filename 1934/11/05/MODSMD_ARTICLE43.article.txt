# The 						CRITIC

### Bud Brill 
The Stanford Dramatic Council's
presentation of "One Sunday After
noon" Friday evening was received
with enthusiastic applause by a
small, but appreciative audience.
William Murray Timmons, new di
rector, acquitted himself splendidly
with a smooth, well-balanced, and
carefully prepared production. Tim
mons successfully captured and re
produced in his leading players the
theme and spirit of the play.
Outstanding stars were Paul Crary
and Harriette Hall Kilby. As the
shy, lovable Amy Lind, Mrs. Kilby
was quite excellent, surpassing by
far her previous work on the cam
pus. She endowed her role with real
and sympathetic understanding.
And Paul Crary, as the misunder
stood and unhappy Biff Grimes,
was, as usual, the ballast and main
stay of the show. Hi.s convincing
interpretation had an almost pro
fessional finish.
Kay Arthur, as the "Gibson
girlish" Virginia Brush, gave a hu
morous coquetry to her perform
ance which was most pleasing. But
later in the play, when she was sup
posed to develop into a hardened
woman of the world, her work was
not as consistent, due, perhaps, to
lack of experience. Such a charac
terization, and especially develop
ment up to it, is most difficult for
an amateur to portray. Miss Arthur
really did a good, even if not com
pletely consistent, job of it.
Fx'ank O'Neill was excellent as the
jittery, hypochondriacal, Hugo Barn
stead. He made Hugo exactly the
comical ass the playwright meant
him to be. Phil Brown as Snappy
Downer was quite humorous, al
though he played the scenes in
which he was supposed to be middle
aged with entirely too much boyish
exuberance.
Jean Albertson's ability and talent
were wasted' in her small, miscast
role. And an unusually poor make
up didn't aid her portrayal of Amy
Lind's mother. William Yeomans as
the Lamplighter and Robert Boyd as
Otto did nice work in bit parts.
The one outstanding negative crit
icism of "One Sunday Afternoon"
was that, being assentially atmos
pheric, the production lacked almost
entirely the colorful period back
ground and life so necessary to fill
in the crude superstructure of the
play itself. The throb of the ro
mantic spirit of the play wasn't, as
it should have been, a pulse to the
emotional action. One felt that the
patched, amateurish background
was merely an unnecessary tack-on,
leaving the main part oÂ£ the play to
march slowly, rather stolidly, on in
a somewhat drab and colorless man
ner.
The small number of extras, in
expensive sets, and poor costuming
were largely responsible for this.
George Andreini. with an unbe
lievably small budget, did a re
markable job with his four sets, but
he should have been allowed to
spend about four times as much as
he did. The only completely satisfy
ing set was the one in "Avery's
Park." With six scene changes, and
no in between waits, Mr. Andreini
is to be congratulated for his excel
lent handling of his stage crew.
