# INDIAN SOCCERMEN BOW BEFORE S.F.U AFTER FAST GAME
## 3-0 Score Fails To Reveal Card's Fine Plays 
### 
Stanford soccermen lost to the
championship S.F.U. team Saturday
morning, 3-0, but they earned a
i victory greater than that of goals
scored by proving that they can
I play an hour and a half of fighting,
| brilliant soccer of which any team
mighi be proud.
| The Cardinals truly redeemed
1 themselves in that Don game. They
not only played a better game than
they have yet played this season
but they brought to life a spirit
promising to last through the rest
of the season bringing wins to make
up for the shaky start which the In
dians made.
In the first quarter the Cards ran
i the over-confident Dons wild, com
ing withirr an ace of scoring on three
occasions. A1 Navarro, Mike Gomez,
i and Jeeb Haiaby, forwards, were
. the big guns of this first period at
tack.
Then in the second quarter the
; Dons clicked better and made good
their first scoring attempts. In a
, melee before the goal they banged
; in one and a little later repeated, the
I performance. Hughes scored both
! the points for S.F.U.
The half ended with the score 2-0.
I All during the rest of the game
S.F.U. had to moi'e than divide its
â–  time between defense and attack.
I Their third score came when Gor
; don drove home a long fast shot
! from outside the penalty area. Mc
-1 Clelland in goal climaxed a day of
j numerous good saves by clearing ths
only penalty shot of the day early in
| the third quarter.
