# DEVLIN LEADS CARDS TO 31-24 WIN OVER BULLDOGS
## 
### 
Dave Devlin, small but deter
mined. won his first major race Fri
day when he sprinted down the
eighteenth fairway of the Stanford
golf course ahead of teammates and
San Mateo J.C. harriers. Chuck
Nimmo was content to take second,
but his place practically cinched the
Stanford victory, 31 to 24.
Although Devlin was clocked in
15 minutes, 43 seconds, fast time for
the near three-mile course, he was
not the first to finish. Norm Bright,
after leading practically all the way,
tore across the line some 40 yards
ahead of Devlin, but his perform
ance was not counted due to his
ineligibility.
San Mateans Third
Finishing third and fourth were
two jaysees, Harold Broadbent and

Ken Cunningham, both hailing from
Castlemont High of Oakland. These
two runners give indications of be
ing top-notch distance men on the
Coast soon.
Bob Alexander, Card varsity 880
prospect, did well in getting fifth,
considering his recent exposure to
the pre-initiation period. Bill Leslie
and Ed Wasem complete the list of
Card place-men. Rusty March, soph
two-miler, wiis forced to drop out
midway in the race.
Overtake Bulldogs
Broadbent was leading and Cun
ningham was third on the fifteenth
hole, but Nimmo and Devlin over
took them on the long uphill six
teenth. Devlin showed a powerful
gather with his pit-pat stride on the
sloping eighteenth, and passed Nim
mo easily, racing in with 30 yards
over the junior phenom. The race
started on the fifth hole, in accord
ance with the corresponding size of
the J.C. course.
Order of finishing: Devlin (S),
Nimmo (S), Broadbent (S.M.), Cun
ingham (S.M.), Alexander (S),
Matosich (S.M.), Leslie (S), Orem
(S.M.), Wasem (S), Welschmeyer
(S.M.).
