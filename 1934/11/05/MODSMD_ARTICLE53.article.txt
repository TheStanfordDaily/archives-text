# WATER POLO TEAM DEFEATS BRUINS IN HARD-FOUGHT GAME
## S.C. Squad Also Falls Before Cardinal Onslaught 
### 
Staging one of the greatest last
minute rallies ever seen in the
aquatic sport, Stanford's varsity
water polo team nosed out U.C.L.A,
6 to 5 in Los Angeles Friday after
noon. As expected, the Indians had
a much easier time with U.S.C.
Saturday morning, winning by a
margin of 11 to 3.
Stanford often finishes water polo
games with a rush, but few of ihe
spectators saw any hope for Nort
Thornton's undefeated seven when
the Bruins led them by a 5-2 score
with three minutes to go. In a wild
flurry Leo Cook scored twice and
Vlad Taranik and Bob Foster each
once to give the Cardinals their
sensational victory.
Half-time score was 1-all, but in
the second half, before that closing
rush, the dangerous IJclans held the
upper hand and came within a red
whisker of ending Stanford's long
string of triumphs. Dick Dauben
speck, regular guard, and Stuart
Goldthwaite, reserve forward, had
put the Bruins into the lead, with
some valuable help from Bobby Sel
lars and Captain Bob Dexter, ace
forwards.
