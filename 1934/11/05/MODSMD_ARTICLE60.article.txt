It's untrue, untrue, untrue. Every
word of it is false. In fact, the cam
pus opinion written by Chaparral
Editor Steedman in Friday's Daily is
incorrect, if not a trifle exagger
ated.
My boys are all fined, upstanding
lads, not a lug among them, let
alone gorillas from South Africa, or
high school stars from Southern
California. I could never face my
dear old mother if I so much
as had one high school star from
Southern California on my team.
Look what the Hollywood stars did
to S.C.! Look what the S C. stars
did to Hollywood! Well, who cares?
When the Daily Stiff hits the Ham
per and Coughin' team, they'll see
all the, stars they care to.
Who's Steedman that he can talk
so much? He only came from Bur
lingame. And Redwood City has the
climate best by government test.
And besides we saw Steedman
dancing with a certain blonde Wed
nesday night. All the tongues are
wagging now, including the blonde's.
Besides, my boys aren't gorillas.
They're all fined, upstanding lads.

In the browsing room of Colum
bia's new four million dollar li
brary, there will be no textbooks.
In this "gentleman's library" smok
ing will be allowed.
