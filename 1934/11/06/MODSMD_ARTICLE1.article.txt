# NEW RULES ON WOMEN'S LATE LEAVES PASSED
## Overnights Will Be Counted 2:30's; Two Extra Given To Upperclasswomen SPECIAL DISPENSATION "Floating" Late Leaves Not To Be Counted 
### 
"Each overnight leave faken by a
woman shall count as a 2:30 late
leave on the woman's quota." This
was the change in regulations
made by Women's Conference at its
regular meeting yesterday afternoon.
The second change made by the
Conference was a ruling to the effect
that all undergraduate women ex
cept freshmen shall be allowed five
2:30 leaves to be used at random
during the quarter, instead of the
allotted three. A special dispensa
tion was granted the freshmen to
the effect that the "floating" 2:3o's
already used during the month of
October not be counted on their 2:30
quota for the current quarter.
Rest Schedule Rules
Women on rest schedule shall be
allowed one late leave a week, un
less otherwise specified by the med
ical advisor. This regulation was
omitted from the revised social regu
lations and was therefore added by
the Conference.
Marion Storey, chairman of Con
ference, said last night that the n#w
regulations carried on Conference's
revision policy from last year. They
were made in an endeavor to' put
late leaves on a seven-day week
basis. Thus late leaves do not ac
cumulate from week to week and
each night, week night, or week-end
night rates the same. This measure
will tend to keep women on the
campus and will help make Stanford
a residence university.
Floating 2:3o's
The increase in the number of
"floating" 2:3o's allowed will give
women a reasonable number of
week-ends away from the campus.
Conference granted freshman the
special dispensation in view of the
fact that freshmen may already have
used their "floating" 2:3o's before
knowing of the new rule.
Dean Mary Yost, ex-officio mem
ber of Women's Conference, spoke
at the meeting in an effort to help
the Conference make its decision.
She stressed the fact that each living
group must make its environment
such that a woman can do good
academic work, that she can keep
in good health, and that she can
enjoy an adequate social life.
