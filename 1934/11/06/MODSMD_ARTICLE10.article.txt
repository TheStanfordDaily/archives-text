Honor Code conduct was the sub- j
ject discussed at the first instruc- j
tion meeting held last night by the i
Men's Council. Fifty freshmen
were present and asked to ply the
four members the council with
questions of code interpretation.
After the meeting Bob Church,
member of the council, said: "Owing j
to the council's late start this year, i
we have not been able to contact all I
the freshmen before their midquar- i
ters. It will be well for them to j
bear in mind a quotation from the ;
handbook:
" 'The Honor System is neither a j
code or a system of rules but is i
simply a student ideal. The essence
of this ideal is, namely, the ability
of students to take an examination ;
without the surveillance of a mem- !
ber of the faculty, at the same time j
refraining from giving or receiving
aid.'"
With midquarters coming both I
Men's and Women's Councils are i
going to co-operate to .see that the |
honor code is stringently enforced, j
The code is signed when a student j
matriculates; from that time on it j
should be observed."
