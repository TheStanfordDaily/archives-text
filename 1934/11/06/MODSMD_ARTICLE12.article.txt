LOS ANGELES, Nov. 5 </P).
â€”Sir Charles Kingsford-Smith
paraded the streets of Los An

conquering hero in a pair of
fur-lined overalls.
At noonday he shed his fly
ing suit and draped it across a
chair in his hotel room.
"You've no idea how the
blamed thing itches," said the
man who yesterday completed
his second trans-Pacific flight
between Australia and Cali
fornia.
P. G. B. Morriss ,the aviator's
friend and manager of the hotel,
called a neighborhood tailor.
