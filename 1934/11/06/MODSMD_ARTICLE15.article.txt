# Popular Ideas of Prison Wrong, Say Stanfordites

Three Stanford debaters prepared ]
to go to.San Quentin.
They had been sentenced to one J
debate on Compulsory Health In- :
suranee. They were ready to march
through the high, foreboding walls
of the state penitentiary. They were
ready to be "frisked." They would
not quail at the. sight of mounted
machine guns, beefy guards, and
hard-mugged convicts. The dream
fades.
San Quentin is located on a little
neck of land near Sausalito. The
day was sunny. Children were play
ing not far from the prison gates. 1
The guard at the gate was old and !
grey, and spoke with a friendly
Scotch brogue. The movies obviously
had this guy all wrong.
Ed Janss, Bob Grantier, and Dave |
Mellinkoff signed the prison roster. |
They walked and wondered. There
was not, a rifle, pistol, or gatling gun j
in sight.
The prisoners were in Sunday I
best: ties, pressed pants, neat grey
blue shirts. They crowded the as
sembly hall. There were none of
(lie movie mugs; there were young

men, and old men, but neither Janss, i
Grantier, nor Mellinkoff could spot j
the "criminal type." The San Quen- I
tin debaters joked and laughed, yet j
this was the "Big House"—dread of
every heavy who crosses the silver j
screen.
The opening prison debater, an
Alabama U. man, spoke easily and
smoothly. The prison audience was
with him. He roundly evcoriated 1
state health insurance. He shouted
that the prison audience knew what [
state medicine was like. The house j
was in an uproar of approval. Later,
Grantier quipped back, that never i
had he seen a more healthy audience, j
that if this was the result of com- j
pulsory health insurance—that, was
what we needed.
San Quentin's Fresno Stater and j
U.S.C. representative hit hard at the j
"politicians" who would control j
state medicine. Never was there an !
audience so down on the politicians. '
They knew.
Debate over, the Stanford team
walked out through the prison gar- j
den, ate well, and left, victorious but
disillusioned. "Prison" was never !
like this. j

The opening prison debater, an
Alabama U. man, spoke easily and
smoothly. The prison audience was
with him. He roundly evcoriated 1
state health insurance. He shouted
that the prison audience knew what [
state medicine was like. The house j
was in an uproar of approval. Later,
Grantier quipped back, that never i
had he seen a more healthy audience, j
that if this was the result of com- j
pulsory health insurance—that, was
what we needed.
San Quentin's Fresno Stater and j
U.S.C. representative hit hard at the j
"politicians" who would control j
state medicine. Never was there an !
audience so down on the politicians. '
They knew.
Debate over, the Stanford team
walked out through the prison gar- j
den, ate well, and left, victorious but
disillusioned. "Prison" was never !
like this. j
Three Stanford debaters prepared ]
to go to.San Quentin.
They had been sentenced to one J
debate on Compulsory Health In- :
suranee. They were ready to march
through the high, foreboding walls
of the state penitentiary. They were
ready to be "frisked." They would
not quail at the. sight of mounted
machine guns, beefy guards, and
hard-mugged convicts. The dream
fades.
San Quentin is located on a little
neck of land near Sausalito. The
day was sunny. Children were play
ing not far from the prison gates. 1
The guard at the gate was old and !
grey, and spoke with a friendly
Scotch brogue. The movies obviously
had this guy all wrong.
Ed Janss, Bob Grantier, and Dave |
Mellinkoff signed the prison roster. |
They walked and wondered. There
was not, a rifle, pistol, or gatling gun j
in sight.
The prisoners were in Sunday I
best: ties, pressed pants, neat grey
blue shirts. They crowded the as
sembly hall. There were none of
(lie movie mugs; there were young

men, and old men, but neither Janss, i
Grantier, nor Mellinkoff could spot j
the "criminal type." The San Quen- I
tin debaters joked and laughed, yet j
this was the "Big House"—dread of
every heavy who crosses the silver j
screen.
