# Pres. Wilbur Is Inquiry Board Head
## Med College Examination Is Group's Object

On the shoulders of President
Wilbur, as a l'esult of decisions made
at the recent meeting of the Asso
ciation of American Medical Col
leges iii Nashville, is the responsi
bility of heading a council which
annually will conduct a survey of all
medical colleges in the country.
Back from a two weeks' business
trip in the Midwest, Dr. Wilbur re
veals that the council, of which he
is chairman, will have the duty of re
porting the work of the many med
ical schools to see that they are
keeping up the standards of good
teaching required by the medical
profession. Discussion of this sur
vey was the principal business of
the Association of American Medical
•Colleges held in Nashville.
With Ralph Haswell Lutz, dean of
graduate study, Dr. Wilbur attended
sessions of the annual meeting of the
Association of American Universi
ties. He spoke at the final dinner
of the meeting and also gave a talk
on child health protection during
his Chicago stay.
"The University of Chicago, where
the sessions were held, conducts its
work very much like other colleges,"
Dr. Wilbur said, "contrary to the
belief of many that President Robert
Hutch ins has inaugurated some sort
of radical educational experiment."
Dr. Wilbur described 34-year-old
President Hutchins as "a fine and
able young man."
Busy with the business sessions,
Dr. Wilbur had little time for other
activities on his trip, byt of the polit
ical situation he said: "The appar
ent attitudes of the people of the
country now is not so much from
the Republican or Democratic view
point but from that of Pro-Roosevelt
and anti-New Deal." Dr. Wilbur
does not believe that "New Deal"
and "Democratic" are any longer
considered as one.
"Professors, doctors, and other ed
ucational men in the East asked me
if we had gone politically crazy
out here," Dr. Wilbur remarked.
"My reply to them was that they
were merely trying this Socialistic
stuff on the dog—California—before
it was tried on the rest of the
country."
