# Toyon Dance Goes Indian
## 
### 
Featuring an Indian motif through- |
out, the Toyon Informal will begin
promptly at 9 o'clock Friday night,
according to Ed Butterworth, dance
committee chairman.
Festivities will continue until 1
o'clock to the accompaniment of
Ernie Heckscher's orchestra, appear
ing on the campus for the first time |
this fall. Heckscher's organization, j
composed of 11 pieces, will play col
lege medleys, arrangements in the I
Ray Noble style, and the latest of !
dance numbers.
The most efficient public address I
system on the peninsula has been
obtained, thus insuring attending
couples of hearing all announce
ments and entertainment. In pre
vious campus dances this fall a de
fective public address system has
caused a problem for listeners. Such ;
will not be the case at the Toyon !
Informal, promises Butterworth.
Programs, printed in the shape of
an Indian tepee to further ihe Indian
war dance idea, are available at the I
A.S.S.U. office. The entire Toyon
lobby will be transformed into an
Indian atmosphere in honor of the
Stanford-Washington football game
on the following day. â€¢
