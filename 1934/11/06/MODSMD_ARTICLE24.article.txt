SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 5 (A 3 ).—
Battleground of Progressivism for
years, the Far West decides tomor
row the fate of new ideas in states
manship and political economy, cen
tering chiefly about the seething
contest for the governorship of Cali
fornia.
Five United States senators, 35 na
tional representatives, five governors
and a host of state and minor officers

Sinclair Watched
The eyes of the nation arc focussed
on Upton Sinclair's effort to unseal
Acting Governor Frank F. Merriam,
in a campaign said by some observ
ers to be the most momentous since
that of Civil War days. Sinclair's
opponents assert that his attempt
represents a major movement to the
left in political thought, and some
observers declare it may mark the
peak of that thrust.
Fear of bloodshed or fraud at the
polls brought preparations ior guards
and watchers at many voting places,
especially in Southern California.
Prediction that "class warfare"
would follow the election of either
Sinclair or Merriam was made by
Haight, Progressive nominee, who
said Merriam's election would mean
Fascism was coming to California "in
the form of a merciless dictatorship
of wealth."
A call for "complete repudiation of
radicalism" was made by supporters
of Merriam, who declared the Re
publican platform was liberal and
urged an aggressive campaign
"against the threat of Communistic
adventure in California."
