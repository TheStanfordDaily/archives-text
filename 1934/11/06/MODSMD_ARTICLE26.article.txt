# Hoover Backs Up Republicans
## 
### 
SUMMIT, New Jersey, Nov. 5 (/P).
I â€”The country needs the Rpublican
party "more than ever," former
president Herbert Hoover wrote to
Mayor Ruford Franklin, president of
the Republican Club of Summit, in a
letter made public today.
i The country needs a live and virile
I Republican party," the former presi
! dent wrote. "The whole protection of
human liberty lies in free criticism
and debate. That does not alone lie
in a free press and the platform; it
lies also in adequate representation
in the halls of legislatures. And that
cannot be attained without party or
ganization and party support.
"In these days, when liberty is en
dangered and when intolerance seeks
j to stamp out the very suggestion of
doubt, the country needs the Repub
! lican party as a virile organization
! more than ever, and it needs an
adequate opposition in the congress
| if our institutions are to survive."
