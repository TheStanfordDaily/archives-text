# Rotten Egg and Messes

When a pinkish Hay Region newspaper
shouts with glaring headlines that "three
thousand t'niverslty of California students"
spent yesterday morning in "milling around
the steps of Wheeler Hall, knocking down and
bespattering with eggs and tomatoes" alleged
campus radicals, something must he wrong
with California's collegiate picture.
Pitiful is the fact Hud collegians over Ber
keley way do not realize that all this hlood
and thunder rumpus in the way of gestures
of "sympathy" results in no good for anyone.
The U.C.L.A. madhouse is apparently under
control and the decision rests with rational
authorities. President Sprout of the t'niver
sity of California politely requests that stu
dents make no attempt to interfere with the
orderly process of I niversilv life, a gentle
manly request that was met with disturbances
yesterday.
Doubtless, radicals feel that they want
greater liberty on the campus; conservatives
believe that the left wingers should be pro
pelled not too gently in the general direction
of the conveniently expansive waters of the
chilly Pacific.
So people throw pies and things.
