Winston Churchill, number one alarmist,
militarist, and imperialist of (treat Britain,
wai'lls bis nation to prepare for a national
emergency; French and Cerman newspapers
burl a few verbal brickbats at each other over
the Saar question; and the sensation-lfton
gering press immediately screams about a
"new war threat" for the ninety-ninth time
in the past few years.
There probably will be a war. Since there
have been wars in the past, it is extremely
logical to suppose that there will be wars in
the future. The undoubted conflicts of In
terest and fears that hover over Europe make
this the more likely. But the distressing thing
about the whole business is the frantic way
in which so-called responsible national lead
ers deliberately intensify and arouse the fears
of their people instead of trying to allay them.
Thus we find Churchill sayiliy, "Yicc-I'rc
micr Stanley Haiti win has said, 'Our fron
tiers arc Ihe Hhinc.'
"Can wc be sure thai the men nam in
control in (icrmany will not reply lo that,
'Our tarffds arc the Thames'?"
Very soothing to the nerves of a war-fearing'
people!
How much more reassuring is the opinion
of (ieneral Jan C. Smuts, scientist, ex-Prime
Minister of South Africa, Boer and World War
hero, and, to top it all, one of the original
advocates of the League of Nations. He says,
"I do not find real war temper anywhere," in
spite of the vogue of "silly drilling and strut
ting about in uniform."
That may be too optimistic a view of the
situation but it makes much more cheerful
reading. If there is to be a war "it will come
when it will •come," and frequent predictions
will onlv hasten the day, not delay it.
