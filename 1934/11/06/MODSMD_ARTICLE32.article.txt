The Daily hikes llie opportunity today of
returning a compliment to a colleague. Last
week when this newspaper took a liberal
stand on the I'.C.L.A. "communistic" suspen
sions, the San Francisco Xenix editorially
bespoke itself in our favor.
Yesterday, at the conclusion of a long and
healed political campaign, when the \ cms
proclaimed its recommendations on candi
dates and propositions as every newspaper is
wont to do on election eve, it ostentatiously
refrained from comment on the candidates
for- the oflices of governor and lieutenant
governor.
The Daii.V suggests that this disinterested
altitude is only rational and fair. With such
a blast of heated propaganda as lias struck
the Stale of California in the past few months,
unprejudiced consideration of merits lias be
come nearly an impossibility.
Intelligent voters who go to the polls today
can best begin bv discarding every piece of
printed matter concerning the Candidates that
they have read. There have been so many
charges, counter-charges, evasions, aide-step
ping, and so much pure bunkum turned loose
thai I he issues have been absolutely obscured.

It Is by common consent agreed that neither
of the leading candidates can do the state any
particular good. So put your newspapers full
of lies and half truths into the asliciin and
vote for that man who in your jirdgment
appears capable of doing the state the least
evil.
Regular stuff meeting today.
