Communism, the excuse used for any disturbance
of uncertain origin, continues to be discussed in con
nection with the U.C.L.A. student uprising. The
trouble, it is very evident, was only remotely con
cerned with Communism. Richard LaPiere, professoi
of sociology, believes that fear of a real "Red" revo
lution is unwarranted and that in most instances Com
munism is merely used to account for any action not
thoroughly in harmony with government policy.
"'The term 'Communism' is our favorite shibboleth
today. As commonly used, it means no more than word
'enemy' or 'I don't like.' In its definite meaning it
has reference to a specific theory of social change
traceable to the doctrines of Karl Marx," LaPiere said.
"The great majority of those who for one reason or
another have been decried as Communists in the United
States are advocating actions obviously out of line with
Communistic ideology. To call strike leaders Commun
ists is to reveal ignorance of the basic concepts under
lying Communistic doctrines," he said.
The professor explained that the true Communist
Would, in accordance with his theory, encourage not
the equitable settlement of laborer-employer relation
ship but the intensification of labor exploitation.
"He would for the same reasons advocate the elec
tion of Merriam for the governorship of California, and
would be anxious to see as president of the United
States as incompetent and conservative a man as can
be found.
"Actually the thing which We have to fear in
America today is not a movement of true Com
munistic nature, but of a wave of enthusiasm for
pome 'messiah' who would deliver us out of the
Valley of discontent a Id Mussolini and Hitler."
All of this is in accordance with the theory that
things must get progressively worse before they can
get better.
"Obviously to Call a common hoodlum a Communist
is to pervert the term. To speak of advocates of pro
grams for social reconstruction is likewise a perversion
of the term," he added.
"It is Used simply to arouse an unreasoned antag
onism against all those with whom we disagree. This
makes the term mocking but'a shibboleth."
The U.C.L.A. trouble is obviously not related to
Communism, the professor said. The students
openly did sortiething the president of the univer
sity didn't like so they were banned as Commun
ists since that is a simple yet effective way of get
ting the leaders out of the way.
"There are Undoubtedly many enemies of the status
quo in contemporary America. That does not, however,
make them Communists. It only makes them enemies
of those who profit, or think they do, by the present
system.
