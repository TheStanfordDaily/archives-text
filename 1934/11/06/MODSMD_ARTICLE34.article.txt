# THIS CAMPAIGN
## 
### CROMPTON BANGS, Jr 
If Merriam wins this election it will not be through
his o\yn efforts or those of his frightened followers.
It will be because the Democrats in Washington scut
tled the Democratic nominee in California. A month
ago Sinclair's chances were at least 50-50, perhaps
even better; today they are about 2 to 3. There is a
long and very very strange story behind this decline
in the EPIC strength.
As everyone knows, this is Sinclair's first race
as a Democrat. In the past 28 years he has run as a
Socialist for Congressman in New Jersey, ant! for
Congressman, Senator, and Governor in California.
He admits he adopted the Democratic umbrella to
keep from getting wet in the American anti-Red
downpour. He also became a Democrat because
there were a million and a half of them, instead
of only fifty thousand Socialists. Upton Sinclair
thought it was a good idea to change horses; the
Democratic higher-ups thought it was terrible.
After the party's candidate, George Creel, had taken
such a shellacking in the primaries, the Democratic
National Committee had Nominee Sinclair wished on
them. To make things worse he was extremely eager
to identify himself with F.R. and the New Deal. So
he went East, saw the President, made friends with
him; in Washington Postmaster-General Farley told
him to "Call me Jim"; Relief Administrator Hopkins
called him a true Democrat ,and Sinclair returned to
California the conqueror—for the time being.
Just how well he had gotten along in Washington
was apparent when Farley endorsed his campaign in
the now famous bonehead letter. On the National
Committee's stationery, among other things, it said:
"By electing Hon. Upton Sinclair, your popular Demo
cratic candidate for Governor, California will have a
combination of leaders in Washington and Sacramento
who can co-operate in the best interest of the people
of the State and Nation." The signature of James A.
Farley appealed in green ink, and below it, undoubted
ly written in his own handwriting, was this postscript:
"Friends of the Administration in Washington will be
gratified for all your efforts. J.A.F." Naturally Sinclair
forces published the letter with delight. Most Cali
fornia papers purposely overlooked it.
As more and more people got scared by EPIC and
Immediate EPIC and deserted to the Merriam or
Haight camps, the Administration feared it had picked
the Wfong horse. Farley blamed the letter on a dumb
stenographer; unofficial spokesman Moley condemned
EPIC and Sinclair in "Today," and then the rats began
to leave the sinking ship.
Standing almost on the White House steps Creel
repudiated Sinclair completely, severely criticized
Immediate EPIC as contrary to the party platform.
He Sorrowfully concluded he could not vote, Sin
clair being impossible and Merriam just as bad.
McAdod's law partner and present spokesman,
W. H. Nt'hlett, deserted to the Merriam camp,
calling this an election between the employed and
the unemployed. Other lesser lights haVe followed.
EPIC forces were shocked and deeply grieved at
these desertions, but none of them stung as badly as
Creel's. Many of them thought him sympathetic; the
editor of EPIC NeWs said that at the party conferences
he was "the best little Bolshevik of the bunch."
While Sinclair's chances have been hurt consider
ably by the desertion of the Democratic organization
they have been helped by underhanded Republican
tactics. Rawest thing so far was the attempted disert
franchisement of some 25,000 voters, nearly all Demo
crats. Fortunately the State Supreme Court stepped
on it in time. Nevertheless, the voters' disgust at
the G.O.P. campaign methods will scarcely m.ike up for
the losses caused by the Democratic organization's
desertion of its candidate.
So if Merriam is elected he should thank not his
followers, but the President, Mr. Farley and Co. who
repudiated their candidate when the going got too
tough.

him to "Call me Jim"; Relief Administrator Hopkins
called him a true Democrat ,and Sinclair returned to
California the conqueror—for the time being.
Just how well he had gotten along in Washington
was apparent when Farley endorsed his campaign in
the now famous bonehead letter. On the National
Committee's stationery, among other things, it said:
"By electing Hon. Upton Sinclair, your popular Demo
cratic candidate for Governor, California will have a
combination of leaders in Washington and Sacramento
who can co-operate in the best interest of the people
of the State and Nation." The signature of James A.
Farley appealed in green ink, and below it, undoubted
ly written in his own handwriting, was this postscript:
"Friends of the Administration in Washington will be
gratified for all your efforts. J.A.F." Naturally Sinclair
forces published the letter with delight. Most Cali
fornia papers purposely overlooked it.
As more and more people got scared by EPIC and
Immediate EPIC and deserted to the Merriam or
Haight camps, the Administration feared it had picked
the Wfong horse. Farley blamed the letter on a dumb
stenographer; unofficial spokesman Moley condemned
EPIC and Sinclair in "Today," and then the rats began
to leave the sinking ship.
Standing almost on the White House steps Creel
repudiated Sinclair completely, severely criticized
Immediate EPIC as contrary to the party platform.
He Sorrowfully concluded he could not vote, Sin
clair being impossible and Merriam just as bad.
McAdod's law partner and present spokesman,
W. H. Nt'hlett, deserted to the Merriam camp,
calling this an election between the employed and
the unemployed. Other lesser lights haVe followed.
EPIC forces were shocked and deeply grieved at
these desertions, but none of them stung as badly as
Creel's. Many of them thought him sympathetic; the
editor of EPIC NeWs said that at the party conferences
he was "the best little Bolshevik of the bunch."
While Sinclair's chances have been hurt consider
ably by the desertion of the Democratic organization
they have been helped by underhanded Republican
tactics. Rawest thing so far was the attempted disert
franchisement of some 25,000 voters, nearly all Demo
crats. Fortunately the State Supreme Court stepped
on it in time. Nevertheless, the voters' disgust at
the G.O.P. campaign methods will scarcely m.ike up for
the losses caused by the Democratic organization's
desertion of its candidate.
So if Merriam is elected he should thank not his
followers, but the President, Mr. Farley and Co. who
repudiated their candidate when the going got too
tough.

SINCLAIR AND THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY
If Merriam wins this election it will not be through
his o\yn efforts or those of his frightened followers.
It will be because the Democrats in Washington scut
tled the Democratic nominee in California. A month
ago Sinclair's chances were at least 50-50, perhaps
even better; today they are about 2 to 3. There is a
long and very very strange story behind this decline
in the EPIC strength.
As everyone knows, this is Sinclair's first race
as a Democrat. In the past 28 years he has run as a
Socialist for Congressman in New Jersey, ant! for
Congressman, Senator, and Governor in California.
He admits he adopted the Democratic umbrella to
keep from getting wet in the American anti-Red
downpour. He also became a Democrat because
there were a million and a half of them, instead
of only fifty thousand Socialists. Upton Sinclair
thought it was a good idea to change horses; the
Democratic higher-ups thought it was terrible.
After the party's candidate, George Creel, had taken
such a shellacking in the primaries, the Democratic
National Committee had Nominee Sinclair wished on
them. To make things worse he was extremely eager
to identify himself with F.R. and the New Deal. So
he went East, saw the President, made friends with
him; in Washington Postmaster-General Farley told
him to "Call me Jim"; Relief Administrator Hopkins
called him a true Democrat ,and Sinclair returned to
California the conqueror—for the time being.
