# BULL SESSION

Some people ask: "What is the
mntrer with Stanford dramatics?"
Others jilst don't go to campus pro
ductions. And having suffered most
t'ismplly from the latter malady o;;
Frday evening, "On; Sunday After
noon" will probably hear more of
the former in the week to come.
This is the beginning of the week
What with he-men, dainty women,
and walks in the park; "In the Good
Old Summer Time" and "Curse You,
Hugo Barnsteads"; derby hats and
starched ruffles —the play swam m
the color of the nineties. That is< it
swam for a whilfe.
But minus the Intermission time
beer and pretzels of "The Drunk
ard," and the abandon of a vaude
ville show—which it resembled,
"One Sunday Aftel*nooil," the script
itself, was labeled a "LULU" by
those who sat through the screen
version.
If the show had been a howling
success it would have been Paul
Crary's fault. His roughy-toughy,
heart of gold Biff Grimes was good
despite the play. But with neces
sarily slow-moving apostrophes to
the stars, even Paul Crary could not
make the thing hum. Second honors
were split between the beer garden
toughs, Frank O'Neil and Phil

THAT PLAY!

i Brown. Never has there been seen
! a college man so drunk on imitation
whiskey.
For two years now Stanford dra
matics have been in the doldrums.
! There have been some "all-rights,"
and several "not-so-goods l ," but a
show that would sweep the campus
,is long in coming. Farm talent is
taxed more by a "bad" pljiy than a
"hard" one. The Farm wants some
"hard" drama.
j Stanford dramatics will do both
I itself and the campus more good by
concentrating on something big than
by rushing through with some fluff.
Is the time 100 short? One real
, play per year is better than two or
I three mediocre productions.
Are the royalties too high? A good
play will foot the bill. From the
1 size of Friday's house, it is quite
apparent that the "tip-off" leaks out
from the most secret of Assembly
i Hall rehearsals. That grape-vine
' report will put over a good play,
i just as it wrecks a poor one.
Too, it was unfortunate that the
i play should have come on the one
week-end when several hundred of
the kind - of - students - who-go-to
things were off the campus.
In justice: Some liked the .show.
