## 
### 
Emma the Owl, beloved bearer of
football good fortune, is gone from
the Farm. And Asta the Turtle, in
experienced as she i.s in the ways
of inspiring luck, has planted her
stolid self solidly in Emma's place.
Emma, whom Stanfordites may
know as the little bronze bird of
the Brotherhood of Turtles, rose
quickly to fame at the U.C.L.A.
game when Jimmy Triolo, High
Potentate of the California chapter
of the B of T, led the Cardinal root
ers in a resounding yell in her name
last Saturday. Emma has hung on
the yell leader's microphone during
every game this season and, as is
well known, every game has been
won.
Noticing Jimmy's bewilderment
when Emma disappeared Saturday
were Mr. and Mrs. H. C. Swan,
ardent Stanford supporters in Los
Angeles. They immediately came
forward with a large, imposing live
tutrle to take Emma's place. The
turtle's name is Asta.
Asta now rests in the confines of
Encina. But Asta will be out among
the rooters for the Washington game
next Saturday doing her best to fill
Emma's shoes in the hearts of the
B of T and Stanford rooters.
