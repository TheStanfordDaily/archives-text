The Editor, Sir:
I am another of the unfortunates
who, due to a loss of a student body
card, has been deprived of the privi
leges of a rooter's ticket at the Big
Game. 1 believe that some leeway
should be allowed us.
Since the University does not per- j
mit duplication of student body
cards, I suggest that they allow us
to purchase at slightly lower than
regular rates those seldom-used
seats behind the goal posts. Then, j
with presentation of a note from the
8.A.C., we could be admitted to
rooters' seats. This system would
involve the payment of a fine by the
careless student; in addition, seats
that otherwise would not be sold
Would be bought.
Can't something be accomplished
quickly?
