# LATE LEAVE SYSTEM
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Spring quarter the late leave sys- 1
tem w.as revised. The rules were
"railroaded" through against the j
wishes of the majority, because it
was not apparent at the time that
the number of late leaves would be j
lessened.
Now we have just been informed ,
of more changes, upon which we
were not even given an opportunity
of expressing our opinion. From
now on the week-end overnights are
to count as 2:3o's, leaving us but j
five other mid-week late leaves per I
quarter. This will make it particu- I
larly difficult for those individuals;
who are in the habit of going heme !
over the week-end.
If such regulations are found nec
essary for the freshmen, why not
make a distinction in regard to upper !
classmen?
As these regulations affect all
women, should we not be allowed,
to vote on them?
M.E.M., 8.C.C., M.C.,
J.R., R.C.L., I.N.
