# HAWAIIAN CREW RACES
## 
### 
Crew racing as it is carried on in
Hawaii is done in a flat-bottomed !
barge manned by six men, who use j
blunt, wedge-shaped blades. The'
course runs two- miles out to sfea,
swings sharply around a buoy, and !
then stretches back to the shore. ' ;
The snout fish has a snout almost j
as long as its body.
