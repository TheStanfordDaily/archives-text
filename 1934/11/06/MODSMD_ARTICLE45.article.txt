# PASADENA PROSPECTS GETTING FEWER
## 
### 
Pacific Coast Ro.se Bowl choices |
are getting fewer and fewer as each I
Saturday finds new leaders upset. I
Stanford is still considered to have
a better chance than anyone else.
That, however, is only because the
Cardinals are favored over Wash- i
ington Saturday. The winner of that
game will be nearly a cinch for the
invitation, although there may be i
extenuating circumstances.
What about Santa Clara, and even !
St. Mary's, Washington State, and j
Oregon?
Santn C'lal'rt, with a record al
most exactly corresponding to j
that of Stanford, will not go to the ;
Rose Bowl.
In the first place, the Broncos j
have yet to beat St. Mary's. In the
second place, their schedule, assum
ing that Santa Clara and Stanford
finish without defeat, is not com
parable to that of the Indians.
But the real reason Santa Clara '
will not go to the Rose Bowl is that
the western contender is chosen an- j
nually by the Pacific Coast Confer
ence, and inviting Santa Clara would j
be an admission that the Broncos
should be in the conference. It is I
almost a sworn promise that, the bid
will be extended to a conference
team.
That goes for St. Mary's, too.
Washington State apd Oregon arc
in a bit different position. The
Cougars have lost twice to non
conference teams. So they are al
most eliminated from Rose Bowl
consideration, even though they have
a very good chance of tieing for or
winning the conference champion
ship.
Oregon is in a very good location
on the ladder to sneak in and grab
the bid if both Stanford and Wash
ington lose games during the re
mainder of the schedule. The Web
foot eleven has lost one game—that
to Washington.,
All told, however, the winner of
Saturday's Cardinal-Husky contest
should be the outstanding choice,
both for the conference title and
for the Pasadena bid.
