# Gridmen Out To End Husky Jinx
## 1930 GAME LAST THE INDIANS WON FROM WASHINGTON Stanford Favored To Oust Strong Northern Team From Title Race 
### 
By Millard Browne
A lot of Indian dreams have met \
; cruel fates in the last three years. I
And it's all the fault of a maliciously ;
! snarling Washington Husky.
Stanford is getting pretty irate |
! concerning the three-year Indian i
' famine when Husky meat has been I
| the entree on the gridiron menu.
Washington has murdered a lot of i
Indian hopes, and the Cardinals have
t intentions of "getting" the Mala- '
j mutes.
i That is the battle cry, issued ofTi- |
| daily and in. earnest from the Stah- |
j ford practice field this week. It has t
i been the battle cry off and on for
: several weeks, but Coach Tiny j
j Thornhill discouraged it until after |
| warm-ups with U.S.C. and U.C.L.A. j
Washington has been pretty mean 1
; to the Indians for a few years now, j
i and the poor down-trodden Card- j
| inals are balking. In 1931 Stanford I
i slushed and wheezed through a lot
' of mud up at Seattle, and the final
! score was 0 to 0. In 1932, with no
excuse whatsoever, a fair Stanford
eleven lost to a poor Washington j
team, 18 to 13. The Indians looked i
completely bad that day.
Last year climaxed things, and the i
nasty Huskies took a bite out of j
1 Stanford's claim to Pacific Coast ,
■ supremacy by standing intact while ■
I the Indians wore -themselves out j
[ treading water, and then sneaking j
■ up to drop a couple of place-kicks j
j over the Cardinal goal for a 6 to 0
| victory.
Now Stanford, with a team which j
thinks itself capable of doing it, in- <
I tends a settlement. There are a few j
| outsiders who also think the Indians j
i can beat Washington, but these peo- j
i pie do not vote in Seattle. That i
l Northwestern crowd is rather proud i
{ of Jimmy Phelan's Huskies this year, j
For the * third consecutive week, j
Stanford is laughing in Madam !
Hardluck's face, and is practicing j
with a team devoid of injuries. Stan j
1 Anderson, reserve quarterback, was
the only player not at practice yes
terday. He is confined to the hospital
with a lingering cold, but Dr. Fritz
Roth, team physician, said last night
he will soon be ready to go.
Woody Adams and Bob Black took
things fairly easy in a long, but rou- j
tine workout, as Tom Callaghan
joined the first string at running I
J guard in signal practice. Both Ad- I
ams and Black are in good shape >or :
' the Husky invasion, however.
While the Seattle bunch was voic- j
ing enthusiasm and confidence in its j
contribution to the Coast Confer- ;
1 ence title race, sport authorities and j
J non-expert rooters who had re
" ! turned from the southland and Stan- I
ford's totally pleasing appearance in j
' completely trouncing U.C.L.A. were j
very blunt in claiming they could
. not conceive of a Cardinal loss dur- 1
ing the next few weeks.
In 1903, Wisconsin played a foot- i
ball game in 10 inches of snow.

A lot of Indian dreams have met \

And it's all the fault of a maliciously ;
! snarling Washington Husky.
Stanford is getting pretty irate |
! concerning the three-year Indian i
' famine when Husky meat has been I
| the entree on the gridiron menu.
Washington has murdered a lot of i
Indian hopes, and the Cardinals have
t intentions of "getting" the Mala- '
j mutes.
i That is the battle cry, issued ofTi- |
| daily and in. earnest from the Stah- |
j ford practice field this week. It has t
i been the battle cry off and on for
: several weeks, but Coach Tiny j
j Thornhill discouraged it until after |
| warm-ups with U.S.C. and U.C.L.A. j
Washington has been pretty mean 1
; to the Indians for a few years now, j
i and the poor down-trodden Card- j
| inals are balking. In 1931 Stanford I
i slushed and wheezed through a lot
' of mud up at Seattle, and the final
! score was 0 to 0. In 1932, with no
excuse whatsoever, a fair Stanford
eleven lost to a poor Washington j
team, 18 to 13. The Indians looked i
completely bad that day.
