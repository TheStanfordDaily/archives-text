Norm Bright, ace of Stanford's
hard-luck track ineligibles, placed
himself among the nation's leading
distance men yesterday afternoon
when he was clocked in 9 minutes
25.6 seconds for the two-mile run.
Just how fast Bright's time ac
| tually was will be realized on re
calling that the 14-year-old Big Meet
record is 9 minutes 38 seconds.
| Apparently the conditions couldn't
! have been worse for a fast time.
Bright was running alone; only last
| Friday he had won the three-mile
| cross-country race in" the San Mateo
j J.C. vs. Stanford varsity meet; the
i track was chopped up and soft in
I spots.
Bright, however* went out from
! the gun, running two laps in 2:15,
| three in 3:25, seven in 8:21, and then
driving through the last lap in
i 64 seconds.
