Runners-up last year in intra
mural touch football competition, the
A.T.O. team fought hard to maintain
its high position against a smooth
Deke team yesterday before bowing
14 to 6.
Also played at the frosh fields was
Phi Delta Theta's 6 to 0 victory over
A.R.L., and the win of Breakers over
Sigma Nu 11, 18 to 0.
The Dekes had the game well un
der control until their 14-point lead
was threatened late in the last pe
riod by CarVer Goss' pass to tValter
McNiel for a touchdown. This gave
X.T.O. its only points.
D.K.E. had meanwhile scored on
two well-executed passes, one Arne
Anderson to Robin Lindsey, and the
other Bob Steiner to Aylett Cotton.
Lindsey converted after each of these
touchdowns.
A trick play started the scoring for
Breakers, Harlan Carter plunging
toward the line with the ball, then
lateraling to Art Allen, who passed
to Berry for six points.
Phi Delt's deciding score came
against A.K.L. on a pass from Rich
ard Brodrick to Bill Blackburn.
