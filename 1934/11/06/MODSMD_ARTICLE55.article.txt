# UNDEFEATED CUB, PAPOOSE ELEVENS TO VIE SATURDAY
## Berkeley Will Be Scene Of Saturday's Clash 
### 
A game rivalling the Card-Husky
combat is promised East Bay fans
Saturday when Bear Frosh meet
Card Frosh. Both of these yearling
elevens have gone through an un
defeated season, toppling over some
of the toughest jaysee and frosh
teams in the'state.
Coach Jim Bradshaw's babes
trounced the Bakersfield J.C. Sat
urday 21-0, showing the same pow
er and flash that has characterized all
of their games. The frosh are strong
in that thing that wins ball gamesâ€”
the ability to score touchdowns.
They have run up scores into two
figures in practically every game.
Coach Clint Evans' Cal Frosh won
over the Glendale J.C. Saturday,
28-7. The southern team is strong,
and the frosh were handicapped by
injuries, but still they could not
be denied. Four backfield men were
in doubtful condition, and two line
men were unable to play. Jack How
ard starred for the frosh, ripping off
large yardage from scrimmage.
Backfield stars include Perry
Thomas and George Cornell, all -
County men from Berkeley; John
Meek, roly-poly brother of the lanky
Dave; Hampton Poole, .smashing
fullback, brother of the U.C. track
captain-polevaulter of several years
ago, and Arne Davis.
In the line, Captain Bob Herwig
is a bulwark at center, Charlie
Wheeler of Piedmont and Vai'd
Stockton are at guards, and Ned
Sparks is a standout at end.
A battle looms for extra-point
honors Saturday. Sparks has kicked
thirteen consecutive points-after
touchdown for the babes, and when
he is out Wheeler rarely misses. For
Stanford, the cool Bill Paulman is a
sure extra-point man. He has an
almost perfect record for the season.
