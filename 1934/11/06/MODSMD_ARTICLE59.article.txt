Last night's scrimmage of the
Daily Stiff football team showed
there was something scrummage. So
today I have applied a little scram
mage and am going to fire the whole
first team.
I am, perforce, sorry to have to do
this, since my boys are all fined, up
standing youths, every one the per
fect picture of blooming, vigorous
health and beauty. But I feel it is
both fitting and proper to do this.
The tjoys don't have the right mental
attitude. They are more interested
in reading a book for boys written
by Pop Warner, called "Pop War
ner's Book for Boys," than in play
ing football.
Two of our best backfield men
failed to show up last Thursday be
cause they were studying for an
econ ex. They care more for their
books than the integration of their
personality and the development of
their fine, upstanding bodies.
This was definitely proved 'to me
last night, when the first team
called the wrong signal. Instead of
our famous touchdown play, the
boys called "7177," which turned out
to be a sorority telephone number.
