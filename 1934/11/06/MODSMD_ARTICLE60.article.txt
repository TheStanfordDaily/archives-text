# DON EDWARDS DROPS TWO TITLE MATCHES
## 
### 
Don Edwards has had a bad week. |
Two losses and two important titles
left the Edwards family mantle. The
author of the most disastrous de- j
feat is none other than Edwards |
golf pal and nemesis Ernie Peiper,
who made quick work of him in the
San Jose city golf championship,
the author of the other was Jack
Hoerner, his long time golf enemy
and team-mate on the Stanford var
sity golf squad. Edwards donated
him (he number four position on the
squad in a close match Friday after
noon. '
Edwards lost the San Jose title, |
which he was defending by a three i
and two margin to Ernie Pieper,
quarter-finalist in the U.S. amateur
this year. The match was over 36
holes.
Opening fast Edwards lead Peiper
on the first nine holes of the en- |
counter. He dropped this on the
second and went behind on the!
third. On the final holes of the
match he rallied briefly but was not i
able to withstand the pressure of
Peiper's flawless golf.
His play on the Stanford course
was quite another thing. The Friday
version of the regular tangle between I
Edwards and Hoerner was perhaps
the poorest exhibition of what is |
known as championship golf that j
the course has seen in some time. ;
Hoerner's errors were the only rea
son that Edwards was not severely j
whipped. In holding the first nine
holes even Edwards won two holes :
on Bogeys. Hoerner won the elev
enth hole to go one up there. He
maintained that lead through the
eighteenth hole where Edwards
three-putted to tie the hole and :
to lose the match.
In other ladder matches Henry
Edwards lost a two and one decision ,
to Bill Hoelle and Morse Erskine
swamped Bud Nichols six and five.
