# Ex Committee Acts On Varied Problems In Heated Discussion
## Daily, Dramatics, Industrial League Subjects Of Much Debate 
### 
With more heated discussion and
expression of opposing opinions than
has been apparent at any previous
session, the Ex Committee last night
attacked several weighty problems,
then confined its action to that of a
negative nature.
Propped was the discussion to rec
ognize the campus chapter of the
League for Industrial Democracy,
pending word from President Wil
bur; tabled was the recommendation
for the changes in the election of the
Daily editor, with a committee being
nominated to make a recommenda
tion to the Ex Committee at its next
meeting; considered, without action,
were the complaints on the delin
quent delivery of the Daily, the
campus interest in dramatics.
Positive action consisted of the
usual approval of dates, minutes of
subsidiary organizations, and the
Music Council charter, proposed last
meeting.
League Question K^sts
On the League for Industrial Dem
ocracy, the committee listened to the
letter from the local organization in
which the aims of the organization
were expressed. The L.1.D.-is a na
tional movement with chapters on
many colleges throughout the coun
try whose purpose is to further in
terest in social problems and to
eventually suggest constructive so- j
lutions for those problems. President
Wilbur is now reading the constitu
tion of the L.1.D., and the Ex Com- 1
mittee deferred action until word :
from him.
Discussed at greatest length was j
the proposed alteration of the Daily
editor election, as outlined in yes- j
terday's Daily and as presented for
the Publications Council by Stan '
Beaubaire, Daily editor.
The new provision giving editorial ;
board three votes apiece and the 1
editor five votes was the seat of the
opposition. Dave Mellinkoff stated
that under this system the editorial
board would be directly respon- j
sible for almost one-third of the
votes, and feared "potentially cor
rupt" boards in the future. Beau
baire pointed out that this was the
main factor in the new plan, and the
likelihood of the board casting any
where near 20 votes for one candi
date was extremely small. Mellinkoff j
countered by showing the import- j
ance of each vote in editorial elec- j
tions.
Committee Appointed
Sam Lee, Vivian Kay, and A1
Blackman were appointed a com
mittee to report on the changes to
the committee next Tuesday, while
Mellinkoff will also make a pro
posal of his own.
The meeting was closed with a re
port from the theatre committee by j
Helen Ray, during which .she urged :
individual members of the Ex Com- j
mittee to learn campus sentiment on
ihe question of the proposed theatre
financed in part by student money. I
