# La 						Piere Relates Worries Of Individuals In War
## 
### 
Illustrating with actual experi- '
cnces, Professor Richard T. LaPiere
spoke last evening at the Toyon ;
; Smoker on "What To Do in the Next
! War."
When cill d if another war occurs,
according to Professor LaPierc, three '
i courses will be open to the man eli- '
gible to tight; following the herd into
battle, refusing to be drafted, thius
branding himself as a slacker, and
making himself a "war profiteer,"
II the man goes to war, he will
gain little more than a knowledge of
the miserable side of life, while at
I the same time he stands to lose many
'things* his peace of mind, money,,

time, and perhaps hi.s life.
Should a man refuse to fight, he
will be looked on as a coward, tem
porarily, but at least he may eat
and keep his life. At the conclusion
of the war he may even be praised
for being sensible enough to stay
away from the melee.
The man who works in the fac
tory or obtains a job as a "dollar a j
year man" in Washington makes of
himself a supporter of the war and j
at the same time may make finan- \
cial gains. Either of the last courses j
is preferable to the fighting, how-'
ever, says LaPier, speaking with the !
experience of the last World War.
