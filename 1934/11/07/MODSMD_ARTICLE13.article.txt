### 
NEW YORK, Nov. 7 (/-P).â€”Frank
lin D. Roosevelt, confronting grave
national problems at his home in
Hyde Park, New York, had the sat
isfaction of knowing that the coun
try was behind the New Deal at
least as strongly, if not more strong
ly, than it was two years ago, as the
Democratic party swept to almost
unprecedented victory.

In early hours this morning Re
publican senators had been forced
out in some states, and others ap
peared to be going. A two-thirds
majority for the Democrats already
1 conceded in the House seemad cer
tain to be matchcd by at least that
large a margin in the Senate. The
possibility of an upper house of 70
Democrats, 24 Republicans, 1 Farrn
er-Laborite, and Progressive loomed
as late returns were tabulated.
Incomplete returns indicated
that Senator David A. Reed, caus
tic critic of President Roosevelt's
policies, had lost a hitter fight in
Pennsylvania to Joseph F. GufVey,
former Democratic National Com
mitteeman.
In Connecticut, tha Republican,
Waleott, found A.F.L. opposition
too great and was defeated by Ma
loney; while with the support of
Missouri's "Tammany Hall," Judge
Harry S. Truman defeated Senator
Patterson, Republican.
President Roosevelt's choice,
Governor Herbert H. Lehman,
was swept hack into New York's
executive chair for a second term;
as Democrats gained control of
even the New York State Assem
bly. traditional Republican strong
hold, and also the State Senate.
For a time the veteran Democratic
Senator Walsh trailed in Massachu
setts, but appeared safely elected as
returns became more complete; while
another New Deal candidate, James
M. Curley, gained a good lead in the
race for governor.
The LaFollettc brother team,
out in Wisconsin, took their new
Progressive party standard to early
but scant leads over both Demo
cratic and Republican nominees
for Senator and Governor.
Kansas went wet by a very scant
margin, with one-third of the re
turns showing a 4,000-vote lead.
Latest returns available showed
that only three Republicans were re
turned to the Senate from the east
ern states.
