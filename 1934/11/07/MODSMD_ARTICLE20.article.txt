# EPIC Head Congratulates Governor but Says Campaign Vile
## LOCAL OPTION DOWNED Winner Lauds Californians On Americanism 
### Associated Press Editor 
Conceding defeat at an early hour
this morning, Upton Sinclair watched
an ever-increasing tide of Repub
lican votes bury his campaign and
cause, and return Frank F. Merriam
to the governorship of California, ac
cording to Associated Press reports.
At the same time, in a sensational
statement over the radio, the Social
ist-Democrat addressed his remarks

to his victor and said:
"We congratulate you on your vic
tory, and are preparing for the next
campaign, for we ourselves have
won a colossal victory. Our vote has
sounded the country, and has
doubled in ten weeks.
"We have done this in the face
of a campaign of vilification the
like of which has never been seen
in America. At this point it would
not be violating a confidence to
say that Roosevelt told me he
I would broadcast in favor of pro
duction for use."
Sinclair served notice that his
EPIC plan, denounced by his oppo
nents as being utterly impractical
i and Communistic in nature, would
j be carried forward.
He asserted that thousands of
I votes had been stolen in yesterday's
! epochal election. He also hinted at
I recall proceedings, stating openly
that "the discontent of the people
under the new governor will amount
I to fury."
I Laying claim to victory, Merriam
thanked his supporters over the air
waves last night, and stated that the
i election indicates that "California
remains loyal to Americanism and
; to the principles of government un
der which this country has advanced
to leadership among nations."
The trend against Sinclair ex
tended even into the center of EPIC
j strength, with returns showing
Merriam ahead 6 lo 5 in Los Angeles,
i In 30 of the 58 counties of the state
I the Republicans were victorious by
I a 2 to 1 margin or better.
George J. Hatfield had more
trouble in defeating the EPIC Demo
crat, Sheridan Downey, for Lieu
| tenant Governor, although late re
i turns showed that he was ahead by a
I safe margin.
Among the propositions voted
upon, No. 2. the state liquor control
I amendment, was being carried by a
2'x to 1 margin, and No. 13, provid
| ing for local option was smothered
I under a 5 to 1 defeat.

I under a 5 to 1 defeat.
Conceding defeat at an early hour
this morning, Upton Sinclair watched
an ever-increasing tide of Repub
lican votes bury his campaign and
cause, and return Frank F. Merriam
to the governorship of California, ac
cording to Associated Press reports.
At the same time, in a sensational
statement over the radio, the Social
ist-Democrat addressed his remarks

to his victor and said:
"We congratulate you on your vic
tory, and are preparing for the next
campaign, for we ourselves have
won a colossal victory. Our vote has
sounded the country, and has
doubled in ten weeks.
"We have done this in the face
of a campaign of vilification the
like of which has never been seen
in America. At this point it would
not be violating a confidence to
say that Roosevelt told me he
I would broadcast in favor of pro
duction for use."
Sinclair served notice that his
EPIC plan, denounced by his oppo
nents as being utterly impractical
i and Communistic in nature, would
j be carried forward.
He asserted that thousands of
I votes had been stolen in yesterday's
! epochal election. He also hinted at
I recall proceedings, stating openly
that "the discontent of the people
under the new governor will amount
I to fury."
I Laying claim to victory, Merriam
thanked his supporters over the air
waves last night, and stated that the
i election indicates that "California
remains loyal to Americanism and
; to the principles of government un
der which this country has advanced
to leadership among nations."
The trend against Sinclair ex
tended even into the center of EPIC
j strength, with returns showing
Merriam ahead 6 lo 5 in Los Angeles,
i In 30 of the 58 counties of the state
I the Republicans were victorious by
I a 2 to 1 margin or better.
George J. Hatfield had more
trouble in defeating the EPIC Demo
crat, Sheridan Downey, for Lieu
| tenant Governor, although late re
i turns showed that he was ahead by a
I safe margin.
Among the propositions voted
upon, No. 2. the state liquor control
I amendment, was being carried by a
2'x to 1 margin, and No. 13, provid
| ing for local option was smothered
I under a 5 to 1 defeat.
