# Conference Scores; Yes and No, Maybe Perhaps
## 
### 
Monday, Women's Conference ruled that
overnight leaves taken hv a Stanford women
shall he counted as one of the 2:3(1 o'clock
late leaves on women's quota.
Yesterday, petitions sent out through soror
ities and dormitories were signed and left in
the hands of Conference heads, with the re
sult that Chairman Marion Storey has an
nounced that Monday's decision will he held
in abeyance until reconsideration is possible
:il an emergency meeting called for next
Tuesday.
Opposition to the drastic and arbitrary
change centered in two fields. One, that the
Conference had not given sufficient publicity
to the proposition in order to insure sufficient
advance discussion, is dominant. The other
lies in the fact that many women object to
the policy of telling Stanford women when
:ind when not to go home for the week-end.
The lirst objection is probably valid. Miss
Storey took it x for granted that Conference
members would acquaint their various living
groups with the idea, announced in Confer
ence meeting in plenty of time with that end
in view. It seems that Conference members, in
many cases, did not bother to mention the
plan for discussion, until alter ratification
this week by two-thirds of those voting.
Objection number two is debatable.
Whether Stanford women shall be considered
mere babies for the week-end is not for the
Daily to say. Many visit their parents and
hit the hay by 10 o'clock in I he evening. Others
don't say when they retire, and if their parents
cannot or do not regulate them in this respect,
il probably is impossible for any university
to do the job thoroughly. On the other hand,
il appears that two 2:.'}() leaves each week,
with five optional "lloaters" in addition,
should be plenty for any woman, Stanford or
Los Angeles variety.
Si\ days remain for careful consideration.
It doesn't matter what the final decision is,
except that it should be the majority opinion
of Stanford women, who will abide by that
decision, a verdict designed for their own
wel fa re.
Don't be misled by the mob opinion. Think
the matter over for yourself, be honest, and
lel I your Conference representative what you
want.
