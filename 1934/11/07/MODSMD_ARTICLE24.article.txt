Dormant radio-newspaper loud threatens !
to Hare up again with the establishment of a j
strong news bureau comparable to the major I
press associations in scope and coverage. He- |
cause the radio strikes at the very life-blood
<>l the newspaper, advertising, the publishers
will be perturbed over the disturbance of an
armed truce which has existed since the first
of the year.
Radio has but one advantage over the news- 1
paper in the disemination of news; and that j
advantage is speed. It has no end of disad
vantages. The sensible course for the press,
it would seem, lies not in the attempt to stifle j
the one legitimate advantage of the radio; but 1
rather in the development of a system of
printed words that will equal or surpass the |
speed of radio.
Such a system is a possibility thai may be
expected in the not too far distant future,
according to Frank Parker Stockbridge, for
mer editor of Popular Mechanics and present
editor ol Ihv American Press. Writing in (Jtiill,
publication of Sigma Delta Chi, professional
journalism Iraternity, Stockbridge envisions
the newspaper of the future as radio impulses 1
originating Irom a central bureau. The im
pulses will operate a machine in the reader's !
home much like our present day teletypes and |
the news, pictures, sports, ads, and cartoons ,
will be printed right in your home.
The machine may operate continuously
throughout the day; and the news will be i
available immediately when reported at the
central ofliee, with no delays for editions or
train times. The result would be much in ap- :
pea ranee as our conventional dailies. The '
paper might be read at any time during the |

day, it' Iho reader wore interested enough
lit* might sit close to the roooivor and soan the
words us they wore printed.
| The scheme is practicable; although too
costly at present, and those who want their
news bulletins with the utmost speed will
have to wade through a barrage of patent
medicine or motor oil advertising to get it.
