The Daily hears with pleasure that the
slow and evolutionary process of securing a
path hack of the library lit for pedestrians
and not for caterpillar tractors has taken
another forward step. Work will soon begin
on a new type of seini-permanent coating for
the path similar to that used on the road in
front of Lagunita.
Likewise from the Comptroller's office
comes announcement of plans to provide
better lighting around the Basketball Pavilion
and in front of Kncina Hall. Popularity of the
Pavillion as an activity center makes this
especially necessary. Also fifth Moor residents
at Kncina now view with satisfaction the
accomplished fact of new telephone booths in
their lofty abode.
All this just goes to show that Al Roth and
the Comptroller's office, in the midst of the
weighty problem of making income balance
outgo, have not forgotten the simpler things
of campus life. There are doubtless other ex
amples their thought!'ulness.
And along with the foregoing bouquet comes
the opportunity of making one suggestion:
some sort of lighting system together with
the new surface would greatly improve that
path back of the library. There is a good deal
of traffic after dark between the halls and the
post office, the Cellar, and other parts of the
campus. As it is. hall residents must chart
their course by the stars and the twinkling
lights of Kncina and trust to luck that the
intervening space will be covered without
mishap to life and limb. A less fallible form of
guidance would be appreciated.
