### CHARLOTTE BURRIDGE 
WITH ELIOT GRINNELL MEARS

The dramatic flight of the Lady Southern Cross
from the antipodes to the San Francisco Bay region
has captured the headlines, in spite of an election of
great consequence. Coming like a rocket over the
Pacific, the record-breaking' flight of Sir Charles
Kingsford-Smith and Captain P. G. Taylor from Bris
bane, Australia, to Oakland, California, marks a new
triumph for aviation.
The chief significance of this event, according to
Dr. Eliot Grinnell Me- : rs, professor of geography in
the Graduate School of Business, is the continued an
nihilation of the Pacific. "This century will be known
as the Pacific Era," says Dr. Mears. "Already we have
witnessed a tremendous revival of political and eco
nomic activity in eastern Asia, while the opening of
the Panama Canal two decades ago has revolutionized
shipping and trade routes. The Pacific, particularly the
North Pacific, is now a focal area in social and im
perial activity."
Professor Me. is led to believe that few persons
realize the world is spherical, since ideas of location,
distance and direction are gleaned from the prevalent
Mercator's projection, while, as a matter of fact, the
globe presents the only true representation. Distortions
of the Mercator projection confuse one into reckoning
that western North America and eastern Asia face
each other, instead of being in somewhat of a straight
line, as is actually the case.
"The shortest airline from Panama to Shanghai
crosses Yucatan. Gulf of Mexico, Texas, Wyoming,
sweeps east of California and goes through British
Columbia and the Aleutian Islands. Panama to
Juneau is about 4500 miles, Juneau to Tokyo 4000
miles, and Panama to Tokyo 8425 miles.
"Distances between America and Asia are frequently
misunderstood because many persons fail to appreciate
that it is a shorter distance from Panama to Calcutta
than it is Singapore, to Melbourne than it is to Shang
hai, and that Manila is closer to Brisbane than to
Honolulu.
"The most significant feature of Pacific geography
is the central location of Japan in the North Pacific
world. Land masses compel maritime vessels to length
en their journeys considerably, but with the discov
eries and superior means of air navigation, as demon
strated by Sir Charles King.sford-Smith, Pacific travel
lines are being greatly abbreviated.
"Japan's strategic position becomes instantly ap
parent, whether for naval, military, economic or other
considerations, by a knowledge that Port Said, Wien,
Winnipeg, and Denver are equidistant at a distance of
5500 to 55)00 miles, Moskva is closer than Seattle, and
Calcuttu, Batavia, Singapore, and Honolulu are less
than 4000 statute miles away. Any discussion of a
Monroe Doctrine for Asia must take full account of
Japan's key position astride the Pacific north of the
equator.
"Anyone can figure out an exciting daily schedule,
especially when you reflect that the actual flying time of
the Lady Southern Cross in the 7350-mile hop was
somewhat less than that of the Overland Limited
running between San Francisco and Chicago."
Professor Mears has taken an active part in the
Institute of Pacific Relations meetings. He has pre
pared papers for the sessions held in Hawaii in 1027,
Kyoto (Japan) 1029, and Banff 1933. He has made the
Pacific area one of his major fields of geographical
study.
