# BULL SESSION
## 
### 
As this is written, Californians are [
voting at the end of the most bitter
! political campaign in recent years:
They are pushing, shoving; shouting, !
■ and above all—promising—in what
they consider to be an election to de
cide the late of the Sovereign State
I of California.
i There has been so much noise and
| humbuggery that there are many
who have come to believe that the ,
gubernatorial choice is a momentous
one. They have talked themselves
into thinking that if "Our Candi- |
date" is elected ,the State is headed |
for the high road of prosperity and
eternal bliss, and that if "Your Can
didate" is .elected damnation or lin
■ gering purgatory is the inevitable |
result.
According to both sides, the issues
J are clear-cut, the election will be de
| cisive, and today—one Party will
I march into Sacramento, and the
I other Party will march out of the
{ state.
j
Would that that were true; what
I a relief to be rid of one of the
| major pack of*political wolves. But I
j though the election be a landslide
; for Merriam or Sinclair, little will
; be decided, and the same eld gangs
will still be with us. J

AFTER THE BALL IS OVER

| If the issues in this election had
been clear-cut, or even neatly trim- !
1 med —the "people" might have some
ground for the relief that their
choice amounted to something. But
the issues and candidates are drip- |
ping with mud and "red" goo. More
than an election, the State needs a
good bath. For in the present state j
of confusion, there are Merriam men
who damn, and Sinclair men who j
praise the EPIC plan without having
j ever read it. There is a good sized j
block of citizens, voting against men- ,
, aces they have been told exist, and |
I tilting at wraiths which like good
wraiths have an absolute lack of ;
substance.
The election indicates nothing ex- i
! cept that the voters dislike certain j
straw men and like others. By no j
stretch does it mean that the voters
have repudiated entirely — either;
Sinclairism or Republicanism.
Convinced that they have dealt i
i conclusively with the issues at stake, j
today most citizens will settle down j
jto rejoice or to mope. But unless |
there is healthy action accompanying j
j the rejoicing and moping, four years j
'• from now there will be another po- |
! litical fight, all mud and goo, signi- i
fying nothing.
I —Dave Mellinkoff.

As this is written, Californians are [
voting at the end of the most bitter
! political campaign in recent years:
They are pushing, shoving; shouting, !
■ and above all—promising—in what
they consider to be an election to de
cide the late of the Sovereign State
I of California.
i There has been so much noise and
| humbuggery that there are many
who have come to believe that the ,
gubernatorial choice is a momentous
one. They have talked themselves
into thinking that if "Our Candi- |
date" is elected ,the State is headed |
for the high road of prosperity and
eternal bliss, and that if "Your Can
didate" is .elected damnation or lin
■ gering purgatory is the inevitable |
result.
According to both sides, the issues
J are clear-cut, the election will be de
| cisive, and today—one Party will
I march into Sacramento, and the
I other Party will march out of the
{ state.
j
Would that that were true; what
I a relief to be rid of one of the
| major pack of*political wolves. But I
j though the election be a landslide
; for Merriam or Sinclair, little will
; be decided, and the same eld gangs
will still be with us. J

AFTER THE BALL IS OVER

| If the issues in this election had
been clear-cut, or even neatly trim- !
1 med —the "people" might have some
ground for the relief that their
choice amounted to something. But
the issues and candidates are drip- |
ping with mud and "red" goo. More
than an election, the State needs a
good bath. For in the present state j
of confusion, there are Merriam men
who damn, and Sinclair men who j
praise the EPIC plan without having
j ever read it. There is a good sized j
block of citizens, voting against men- ,
, aces they have been told exist, and |
I tilting at wraiths which like good
wraiths have an absolute lack of ;
substance.
The election indicates nothing ex- i
! cept that the voters dislike certain j
straw men and like others. By no j
stretch does it mean that the voters
have repudiated entirely — either;
Sinclairism or Republicanism.
Convinced that they have dealt i
i conclusively with the issues at stake, j
today most citizens will settle down j
jto rejoice or to mope. But unless |
there is healthy action accompanying j
j the rejoicing and moping, four years j
'• from now there will be another po- |
! litical fight, all mud and goo, signi- i
fying nothing.
