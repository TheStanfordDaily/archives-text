The Editor, Sir:
What kind of men do they have
at California, where they throw eggs
at women? And the football play
ers were looking on, too. With such
manhood, it is no wonder their team
has been beaten so much.
Bill Rogers

The Editor, Sir:
Stating my case briefly, it is this. 11
Stanford has an Art Gallery, and
nothing in it; that is, nothing which
justifies the use of a building ex
clusively for that purpose. Not many
of our universities are so fortunate
as to have a gallery. OfT-hand the
Fogg Museum of Harvard is about
the only one that comes to mind,
and that is a combination museum
and art gallery, but in it' there are
some fine things. One would expect
the same thing here at Stanford, the
Harvard of the Coast. One therefore
is disappointed. I
The writer is not an art critic,
but he does have a certain reaction
from healthy art. It is much the
same pleasure that one gets from
good music or drama. He likes to
stand before the old masters, and
also before some of the respected
moderns. He does not find that he
has time to mope before a lot of
musty hacks that simply serve to i
cover the wall. Some wag will point
out one or two good things in the
Stanford gallery as a way to break
down the writer's wail. Perhaps I
there are a couple of paintings there
that are worthy. All x'ight. that does ;
not make up for the mediocre non- I
entities that one must wade through !
to find one passable work.
Even the most hardened venturer
into the art gallery has the right to
expect something, if nothing more I
than a hodge-podge of which he
makes nothing, or a piece of realism
that sickens him. One wonders if it
isn't better to be disgusted at some
thing at which one will look twice
than to be hopelessly bored and
never look but once. —J.R.B.
