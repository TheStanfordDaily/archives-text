The powers behind the women's
athletic activities at California have
consented to try an "interclass inter
collegiate" system of scoring, for
Tri-sports Day, November 17, for
this year to see how it works.
Mills is still unfavorable to the
idea, but in view of the lact that
Stanford is very much for it and
California is willing to try it, it is
possible Mills may agree for this
year at least.
ll' Mills does not agree, Stanford's
hope of activities for women on an
intercollegiate basis will again be
unfulfilled.

I'LEASE,
MILLS

Stanford says, "Please, Mills," be
cau.se it believes that it will be
more fun and stimulate more inter
est in women's athletics.
But whichever Mills decides, No
vember 17 will be a gala day for
women's sports, with an even chance
that every other spectator will be
cither a linesman or a referee. A
tremendous number of officials will
be necessary to swing such a big
day, and it will be a big day.

beginning
WITH GOLF

Even on field days there must be
8 o'clocks, for golfers. After a
night on the campus, Mills golfers
will rise to pair off with the four
best from the Farm to tee off on
the Stanford course for eighteen
holes of match play. Golf at Berke
ley is in neglect this fall, so there
won't be a triangle in golf.
Eleven women have been turning
in medal scores on the basis of
which the four with the lowest av
erages will compete with the Mills'
team.

After a o clock lor registra

After a healthy interval, swim

scorers retire to put the day down in

A pleasing change from the rest
of the day will be a dance program

TWO OUT
OI THREE

The powers behind the women's
athletic activities at California have
consented to try an "interclass inter
collegiate" system of scoring, for
Tri-sports Day, November 17, for
this year to see how it works.
Mills is still unfavorable to the
idea, but in view of the lact that
Stanford is very much for it and
California is willing to try it, it is
possible Mills may agree for this
year at least.
ll' Mills does not agree, Stanford's
hope of activities for women on an
intercollegiate basis will again be
unfulfilled.

I'LEASE,
MILLS

Stanford says, "Please, Mills," be
cau.se it believes that it will be
more fun and stimulate more inter
est in women's athletics.
But whichever Mills decides, No
vember 17 will be a gala day for
women's sports, with an even chance
that every other spectator will be
cither a linesman or a referee. A
tremendous number of officials will
be necessary to swing such a big
day, and it will be a big day.

WITH GOLF

Even on field days there must be
8 o'clocks, for golfers. After a
night on the campus, Mills golfers
will rise to pair off with the four
best from the Farm to tee off on
the Stanford course for eighteen
holes of match play. Golf at Berke
ley is in neglect this fall, so there
won't be a triangle in golf.
