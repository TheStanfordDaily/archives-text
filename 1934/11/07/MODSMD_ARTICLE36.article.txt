# FROSH SOCCERMEN SCRIMMAGE MENLO
## 
### 
Two ex-stars of Stanford varsity |
soccer yesterday pitted their skill
against each other for the first timeâ€”
but from the coach's bench instead of
on the playing field. Art Hearn, soc
cer coach at Menlo Junior College, I
brought his rfewly organized squad j
to the Farm to scrimmage John j
Moore's Card frosh eleven and bat- [
tied them to a 1-1 tie.
Both Hearn and Moore were main- j
stays of last year's Indian eleven
and both are comparatively new at ;
the coaching game. Stanford scored j
first when Sloane poinded i n a pen- j
alty shot. Play of both elevens ap
peared uniformly even throughout ,
the game with Menlo scoring shortly
before the end of the game.
Saturday the Frosh have a regu
lar game with San Mateo freshmen, j
Varsity's game is also at San Mateo j
this week.
