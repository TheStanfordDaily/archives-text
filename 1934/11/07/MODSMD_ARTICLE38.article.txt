# Huskies Will Test Real Strength of Indians
## TITLE HOPE LURES BOTH TEAMS INTO DISPLAYING POWER 
### 
Stanford will completely open up
twice this year.
The first time probably will be a
case of "have to." The second will
be a case of "why not?"
Stanford will open up Saturday
against the Washington Huskies, for
the simple reason that they will have
to opeji up in order to win. The In
dians will break loose once more
November 24 against California, for
the equally obvious reason that it is
the last game and there will be
nothing to conceal.
But. Saturday Washington will
open up right back at the Indians.
So footballs and l'ootbfjll players are
apt to find themselves strewn,
thrown, and carried all over the
Stanford Stadium in the late after
noon of the day before national
celebration of peace.
Copy Indian Vow
The Huskies, with some silly no
tion of playing football in the Rose
Bowl, are in reality just copy-cats.
They heard about Stanford vowing
not to lose to U.S.C. for three speci
fied years, and they saw that this
worked fine for the first year.
So they went one better at the
start of this season and swore, as if
they really meant it, that Washing
ton would not lose to any major team
in tbi'ee years. That includes Stan
ford, of course, among the major
teams, and Stanford is number five
that the Huskies intend to check off
their list.
Huskies. Broncs Compared
Washington has a team that can
be compared in many ways to that
of Santa Clara, producer of the one
black mark on Stanford's 1934 grid
iron campaign. The Huskies have a
backfield rated equal to that of the
Cardinals, a fairly, light line, very
good passing attack, and no notice
ably weak departments, all of which
factors are claimed by the Broncos.
If Stanford practice gives any in
dication of what the Indians will use
for an attack Saturday, we say
passes, lots of them, reverses, and
quite some straight power.
The ends and backs were gathered
together for quite a lengthy drill in
various forms of forward passing
yesterday, and Coach Tiny Thorn
hill is not in the habit of using
valuable team practice hours and the
B.A.C.'s footballs just to give the
boys some sand-lot. relaxation.

twice this year.
The first time probably will be a
case of "have to." The second will
be a case of "why not?"
Stanford will open up Saturday
against the Washington Huskies, for
the simple reason that they will have
to opeji up in order to win. The In
dians will break loose once more
November 24 against California, for
the equally obvious reason that it is
the last game and there will be
nothing to conceal.
But. Saturday Washington will
open up right back at the Indians.
So footballs and l'ootbfjll players are
apt to find themselves strewn,
thrown, and carried all over the
Stanford Stadium in the late after
noon of the day before national
celebration of peace.
Copy Indian Vow
The Huskies, with some silly no
tion of playing football in the Rose
Bowl, are in reality just copy-cats.
They heard about Stanford vowing
not to lose to U.S.C. for three speci
fied years, and they saw that this
worked fine for the first year.
So they went one better at the
start of this season and swore, as if
they really meant it, that Washing
ton would not lose to any major team
in tbi'ee years. That includes Stan
ford, of course, among the major
teams, and Stanford is number five
that the Huskies intend to check off
their list.
Huskies. Broncs Compared
Washington has a team that can
be compared in many ways to that
of Santa Clara, producer of the one
black mark on Stanford's 1934 grid
iron campaign. The Huskies have a
backfield rated equal to that of the
Cardinals, a fairly, light line, very
good passing attack, and no notice
ably weak departments, all of which
factors are claimed by the Broncos.
If Stanford practice gives any in
dication of what the Indians will use
for an attack Saturday, we say
passes, lots of them, reverses, and
quite some straight power.
The ends and backs were gathered
together for quite a lengthy drill in
various forms of forward passing
yesterday, and Coach Tiny Thorn
hill is not in the habit of using
valuable team practice hours and the
B.A.C.'s footballs just to give the
boys some sand-lot. relaxation.
