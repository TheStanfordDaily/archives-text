# Grays, Ramblers Battle Saturday
## 
### 
I Playing their one and only annual
j game of the football season the Stan
j ford Grays face the California Ram
i biers in a preliminary game to the
Stanford-Washington battle this Sat
j urday in the local stadium.
j The Grays are composed of the
; men who are not good enough to play
i on the varsity squad but are too
! good to be dropped. They parallel
the position of the California Ram
! biers. Games played by these teams
do not count as a year of competition
; against the men. ,
Murray Cuddeback, who coaches
! the Grays, looks forward to a tough
i game this Saturday. Comparatively
1 speaking ihe California Ramblers are
better than the Bear varsity. The
Ramblers beat Nevada 7-0, while
Nevada defeated St. Mary's 9-G, who
; in turn won from the California var
sity 7-0. So if figures mean any
thing the Grays are in for a tough
| session:
Following is the tentative line-up
of the Grays: ends, Walter Chouteau,
Robert Munger; tackles, John Grant,
Millard Holbrook; guards, Lawrence
i Cook, Paul Spennetta; center, Louis
Tsoutsouvas; quarterback, Fred
Abbott; left half, Joe .Vigna; right
half, Ray Lewis; fullback John
Campbell.
