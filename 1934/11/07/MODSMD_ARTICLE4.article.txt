SAN MATEO, Nov. 6 (/P). â€” A
shower of over-ripe tomatoes, their
second in 24 hours, pelted a deter
mined group of University of Cali
fornia students her<? today when I hey
sought to promote to San Mateo Jun
ior College students a state-wide
college "strike" in protest against
recent suspension of five students at
the University of California in Los
Angeles.
Miss Kuth Moore, University grad
; uate student, met mishap in the
: form of a tomato, and went to jail
escorted by police, who were also in
time,to rescue Allan Johnson, Mark
! Trotsky and Edith Arnstein. They
told Dean Charles Morris at the Jun
! ior College they had come on invi
: tation of students at the school. The
j dean warned them his students
I would be unwilling listeners.
Earlier four junior college students
1 believed to have issued the invitation
i wore spirited off the campus by
zealous anti-radical students, taken
| into the foothills and stripped of
j shoes and belts. They didn't get
back in time for the tomato barrage,
I aimed at the quartet who essayed to
speuk from the entrance of the school
at noon.
Meanwhile Dr. Robert Gordon
Sproul, president of the University
of California, was in Los Angeles
conducting his own investigation of
the suspension, there, where the
ousted students have requested an
impartial hearing to remove "the
stigma of radicalism."
