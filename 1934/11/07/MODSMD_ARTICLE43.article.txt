# WATER POLO MEN HARD AT PRACTICE FOR COMING TILTS
## 
### 
Since returning from their tri-
I umphant week-end in Los Angeles,
I Nort Thornton's varsity water polo
ists have started two weeks of hard
! practice for their four remaining
games. The Athens Club, which was
: scheduled to meet the Indians here
â–  November 10, forfeited that game,
but Stanford has yet to play two
j games each with California and the
Olympic Club.
Just before the Card-Olympic
; Club football tilt November 17,
: Stanford will meet the Winged "O'
! paddlers at 1 o'clock. The two teams
! will clash in a return tussle in San
Francisco at 8:30 o'clock Wednesday
| night, November 21. With one of
i the strongest teams in the league, the
' clubmen are sure to give the Cards
j trouble.
In what should be the best game of
I the current season, Stanford and
| California will tangle in the Bears'
pool at 11 o'clock, Saturday, Novem
ber 24, the day of the Big Game.
The Golden Bears have matched the
Indians' scores, almost goal for goal,
against common opponents. These
! ancient foes will again fight for the
j championship in Encina pool at 3:30
I o'clock on Tuesday, November 27.
