# FROSH, VARSITY HOOPMEN CLASH
## 
### 
Tentative line-ups have been an- 1 ,
nounced for the annual varsity- '
frosh basketball game which will be
held in the Pavilion tomorrow eve- ,
ning at 7:30 o'clock. The game will !
be a regular, full time officiated game
and should provide much interest to
basketball fans, as the last annual j
clash was won by the freshmen.
This year the frosh present a fast
team that threatens to follow the j
example of last year's yearling team j
by defeating the varsity five. The :
varsity team, with a barnstorming '
trip to the East coming in the* near
future, are determined to show their '
superiority.
Plans for the game pi'ovide that I
one half be played under the old !
ruling of the center jump, and the j
other half under the new 1934-35 ,
rules which practically eliminate the j
center play. Each team will be regu- j
larly suited up, and coaches have j
suggested that fraternity men bring j
rushees to the ganie, inasmuch as j
this is the rushing period.
Following are the tentative line- |
ups, subject to changes by the '
coaches:
Varsity Position Freshmen
Bost F Lusetti j
Turner . F Lyons j
Gorter C Zonne 1
Lindsey G Lee
Moore G Bigler
