# CUB-PAPOOSE TILT WILL MATCH TWO STAR BACKFIELDS
## 
### 
Coach Jimmy Bradshaw had his
Card frosh first string working out
a defensive to stop the spinners and I
sweeps of the Cal Cubs' "wonder
team" yesterday afternoon as Sat- j
| urday's battle between the two rival
i squads was but three practice days
! off.

While Bradshaw was pointing out j
I the assignments on defensive to his |
backs and linesmen, a team of re- |
j serves handled by Assistant Coach
John Bunntook over the role of the
California frosh and furnished the i
opposition.
Each of the California backs was
duly labeled and represented by a
reserve player. As a matter of fact, !
j there is real reason to know who .
Cal's Coach Clint Evans will send
; out on the field for his starting back- !
i field. During the Berkeley year- j
lings' undefeated season to date a |
hard-running set of backs consist- |
ing of John Meek, Hampton Poole,
and Perry Thomas have played havoc j
with opposing defense.
Bradshaw has matches for Meek,!
Poole, and Thomas, however, as the
frosh followers know. Bill Paulman
has already proved to be a passer ;
! supreme and almost equally handy 1
|as a punter. For shiftiness in the ,
open field the Indian frosh have not j
j seen a better man than their own
\ Jimmy Coflus. The 1934 Little Big ,
1 Game should be a battle between !
! backs.
