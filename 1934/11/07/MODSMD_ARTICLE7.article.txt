# HALL PETITIONS ASK REVOTE ON NEW 2:30 RULE
## Women's Group Will Not Enforce Revision Until After Hearing 
### Dorothy Sweet 
Due to widespread discontent as
evidenced by petitions, the new late
leave regulations will not he put into
effect for at least a week, says Con
ference Chairman Marion Storey.
The petitions circulated through the
Union and Lagunita asked for a re
vote or rehearing on the late leave
question.
In an effort to clear up the situa
tion, Marion Storey held an open
discussion in Eucalypto Lobby of
Lagunita yesterday afternoon. That
the revision was made before suf
ficient discussion of the question had
taken place in the living groups was
the opinion expressed at the meeting.
Petitions Vary
Marion Storey made the following
statement. "The petitions circulated
vary in wording but they all come
directly to the point, that those v/ho
signed them feel that the revision
was passed by the Conference before
sufficient discussion of it had gone
on in the living groups. This is a
very valid objection. No one was
more surprised than I was to find
that some of the living groups had
had little or no discussion to the
suggested revision.
Special Meeting
"Our system of legislation is that
the women elected by their living
groups are givfen the power to de
cide on women's social regulations
after those women have gained the
student opinion through house meet
ings and individual conferences.
Conference is a representative group
of 22 members which is able to get
a thorough and clear picture of the
whole situation pertaining to a par
ticular problem. They are able to
see the stand of the administration,
of the past aims of student govern
ment, and the health and scholarship
of the women students as a whole.
Thus the opinion of those people is
the result of thoughtful considera
tion."
A special meeting of Women's
Conference next Tuesday will re
hearse the late leave revision case,
after a discussion in all living group
house meetings.
