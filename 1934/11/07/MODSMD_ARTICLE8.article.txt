# Ipswich Fired; Daily Team Gets Molehill
## 
### Tinkle Molehill, himself 
(Held over by Popular Demand)
Grim mutiny stalked the ranks of
j the Daily Stiff football team in their
practice yesterday afternoon, and
today Tinkle Molehill, the gizzard of
widiron and one-time bond sales
| man, is coach of the Daily team.
The mutiny started after that tool,
i Coacli Ipswich, insurance, tired the
whole first team because they studied
too much. Then the whole lirst team
came out and fired Ipswich, on per
sonal and moral grounds.
But now the boys are happy to
have me back and are confident that
my inspired leadership, personal
magnetism, and excellent knowledge
of the game will lead them on to vic
tory a.s it did last year. These Chap
i arral stooges we are playing are a
sadly over-rated bunch of thugs
fresh from the wilds of the Palo Alto
I Yacht Harbor. They haven't run up
against any teams harder than the
Channing Grammar School eleven,
who held them to a 54-0 score in the
Milpitas Sunday School League fi
nals. The Milpitas Perpetual Me
morial Interscholastic Honor Award
i Cup is practically ours.
i I have changed ex-Coach Ipswich's
j triplc-grut offense to a far superior
; multiple-grut speed attack, that is
positively the fastest creation that
1 ever came out of Paris, next tq
Gertrude Stein and Fifi D'Orsay.
I have deemed it advisable to re
instate the whole first team, since 1
know they're all fined, upstanding
[youths, and always have the prin
ciples of truth and virtue uppermost
in their minds. And besides, the
Daily is putting them through
1 school.
