BULLETIN
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 7 (/P).
—With returns from 0,964 pre
cincts out of 10,721 in, Governor
Frank Merriam increased his ear
ly lead over Upton Sinclair as late
reports came in tonight. The
standings:
Merriam 1,033,546
Sinclair 800,312
Haight 278,455
Reports from 0,827 precincts in
the race for lieutenant governor
showed the following results:
Hatfield 1,086,043
Downey 004,295
SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 7 (/I 3 ). —
In seclusion, Upton Sinclair sur
veyed today the ruins of his "EPIC"
Democratic drive for the governor
ship while the victor, Republican
Frank F. Merriam, happily claimed
"We have demonstrated the essen
tial common sense of the people of
California."
Former President Herbert Hoover
telegraphed congratulations to Mer
riam and George H. Hatfield, Repub
lican lieutenant-governor-elect, but
made no public comment on the
election.
Merriam Lead Mounts
Hour by hour the figures on yes
terday's crucial battle of ballots
tdded to the Republican triumph
in the state but at the same time
the- "EPIC" champion found en
couragement in them even in defeat.
The returns were nearing comple
tion and Sinclair had rolled up a
vote approaching three-quarters of a
million despite the fact that his
novel bid for power had been reso
lutely fought as radical and Com
munistic.
EPIC Leaders Meet
A meeting of EPIC executives and
campaigners was called in Los An
geles to consider plans for marching
on with their widely advertised pro
gram to abolish poverty and put the
unemployed to work.
Sinclair chuckled as he referred
to the election outcome.
"If we had had a better candi
date," he said, "we might have won."
He called himself "an author of
ioo many books trying to be a poli
tician."
Fight Only Begun
There was seriousness and deter
mination, however, in an expression
he made to his supporters hinting
he had only begun to fight. Last night
he had said a recall effort against
Merriam probably would be started
within six months.
"At the end of the first skirmish,"
Sinclair said today, "I want to ex
press my eternal gratitude and de
votion to all those faithful workers
who have built up the EPIC move
ment all over the state of California.
"1 told them it was their job and
they did it.
"They can count it a great victory
over so many millions of dollars."
'Election Is History'
The former lowan elevated to the
governorship in yesterday's election
asserted the "defeat of Sinclairism"
did not reflect in any sense a victory
for "reactionaryism."
Addressing the Los Angeles
Breakfast Club, he said he had been
told that "what happened yesterday
was the most important event in the
recent history of California."

EPIC Leaders Meet
A meeting of EPIC executives and
campaigners was called in Los An
geles to consider plans for marching
on with their widely advertised pro
gram to abolish poverty and put the
unemployed to work.
Sinclair chuckled as he referred
to the election outcome.
"If we had had a better candi
date," he said, "we might have won."
He called himself "an author of
ioo many books trying to be a poli
tician."
Fight Only Begun
There was seriousness and deter
mination, however, in an expression
he made to his supporters hinting
he had only begun to fight. Last night
he had said a recall effort against
Merriam probably would be started
within six months.
"At the end of the first skirmish,"
Sinclair said today, "I want to ex
press my eternal gratitude and de
votion to all those faithful workers
who have built up the EPIC move
ment all over the state of California.
"1 told them it was their job and
they did it.
"They can count it a great victory
over so many millions of dollars."
'Election Is History'
The former lowan elevated to the
governorship in yesterday's election
asserted the "defeat of Sinclairism"
did not reflect in any sense a victory
for "reactionaryism."
Addressing the Los Angeles
Breakfast Club, he said he had been
told that "what happened yesterday
was the most important event in the
recent history of California."

Merriam Lead Mounts
Hour by hour the figures on yes
terday's crucial battle of ballots
tdded to the Republican triumph
in the state but at the same time
the- "EPIC" champion found en
couragement in them even in defeat.
The returns were nearing comple
tion and Sinclair had rolled up a
vote approaching three-quarters of a
million despite the fact that his
novel bid for power had been reso
lutely fought as radical and Com
munistic.
