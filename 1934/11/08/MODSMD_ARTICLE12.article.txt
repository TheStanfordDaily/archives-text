Cries of "Author, author!" filled
the Little Theatre last night when
an enthusiastic audience gave ova
tion to Masquers .reading premieie
of Thomas Seller's prize - winning
comedy "One of the Family.
The play, a witty comedy, was
outstanding for its dialogue, which
at times approached the superlative
of "hilarious." The plot, however,
was weak and rather commonplace,
and there was just barely enough of
it to form a reasonable foundation
for the dialogue. In spots, notably
in the middle third act, there was
a rather bad tempo lag, and many
scenes tended to become repetitions.
. Stage directions, read with full
force by Jean Albertson, were per
haps the funniest part of the reading.
It is difficult to conceive of the play
as a complete stage production, al
though its humorous lines and situ
ations make it an excellent vehicle
for the reading form of presentation.
James Benet, as the "sensitive ado
lescent," was cleverly convincing.
Robert Balzer, as the precocious
eight-year-old brother, played his
role with all the self-satisfied slyness
of Wonderland's Cheshire cat.
Newcomers acquitting themselves
admirably were Caroline Houseman,
Annelies Morgan, and Rosemary
Sistrom. Better known to reading
audiences were Henrietta Jones,
Frank O'Neill, James Brought on,
and Dick Dawson. All were excel
lent, and read their lines with great
humor. Rosemary Benet and Amelia
Baines did well also, with small first
act roles.
