Stanford women arc turning their
eyes from the world of business back
to nursery and kitchen, and* Stan
ford men have forsaken a conde
scending regard of education for di
rected intellectual development, be

Prefer Home Life
A career, conventional choice of
the Stanford eo-cd, doesn't hold a
candle to her desire for marriage, a
home and children, according to fig
ures released today.
Not only does she prefer marriage
to an independent life, but she is
willing to say so, Mrs. Bodle re

"Since most Stanford women
marry regardless of their early in
tentions, it is a significant com
mentary on the modern girl's point
of view thut she is willing to openly
declare herself for a career secretly

admitted but publicly denied," she
said.
Stanford men are approaching
their college years with a new con
ception of what it means to be pro
tector and breadwinner to a family,
according to Dr. Wrenn.
"The modern college man is ap
proaching his educational home
stretch with a seriousness and an
appreciation not frequently seen
during the years of straight sailing,"
he declared.

"More than ever before he is ask

fessions, poverty, have become very
real to him, and have convinced him
that ho must plan his life to attain
security and happiness."
About 60 per cent of entering
