# Indians To Pit Power Against Husky Passing
## Cards Depend on Grayson For Fast Offense In Saturday Tilt STANFORD CONFIDENT Thornhill Stresses Defense Against Air Attack 
### Millard Browne 
Once upon a time the wolves did
I howl in Seattle town so they could
be heard way down to Tacoma. It
fell to the lot of some Redskins from
sunny California to quiet them.
Yessir, for three straight years,
the University of Washington alumni
wolves did follow one Jimmy Phelan
around baying their fool heads ofl.
And, for three straight years, the
Indians of Stanford administered
the anesthetic by presenting them
with gridiron victories.
Huskies Howl Now
Now, the wolves have calmed
down, and it is the Huskies that do
howl so they can be heard way down
to Pasadena. Once again it falls to
the lot of those Indians to install
the quietus, so a certain group of

Chanting "Stop Grayson,
Alusti/a and Hamilton," the
Washington Huskies, headed by
Jimmy Phelan, are en route
from Seattle to San Francisco
and will disembark in the city
tonight.
Phelan may bring his squad
to the Farm tomorrow after
noon for a trial run on the
Stanford Stadium turf l>eforc
meeting the Cardinals Satur
day afternoon.

people known as the Rose Bowl
Committee can get some sleep.
The Cardinals can, and probably
will, tame the Seattle canines Sat
urday in Stanford Stadium as the
two match power and passes in foot
ball combat.
Indians Capable
So the Washington Huskies will
leave for the Northwest Saturday
night a subdued group of Mala
mutes, and we can all go to bed and
wait for the Big Game.
That is the plot as explained on
the Cardinal practice field.
The Indians have several very
logical excuses for believing them
selves capable of beating Washing
ton's "best team since 1925."
Stanford has a football team
which has yet to be scored upon
via terra firma. No opponent lias
so much as threatened the Cardi
nal goal with ground plays.
It is a reasonably safe assump
tion that Stanford can halt any
Washington land attack. That will
leave passing.
The Huskies can and will pass, and
they may score by this route. How
ever, no one else since Santa Clara
has done so, and Coach Tiny Thorn
hill has had a chance to drill a lot of
pass defense into his backficld and
centers.
Huskies Can Pass
The Huskies have several aerial
plays that are hard to halt. They
include a snappy, bullet pass over
center to a man some ten or twelve
yards across the line of scrimmage.
The pass is figured to strike just as
the receiver begins to break.
Yesterday, with the varsity
working on defense and the third
string doing the tossing, Stan
ford's first string appeared rather
helpless on this particular play.
Washington will Rive this enough
variety by mixing in several well
calculated long passes, and plenty of
running.
Art Ahonen, clever fullback, docs
mosi. of the passing and kicking foi
the Seattle men, while Burl Bufkin
is the chief ball carrier. Socko Sul
kosky, who can be called on for a
few yards through the line con
sistently, is a good blocker, as is
Jay Hornbeak, foxy quarterback.
This is the personnel of Washing
ton's famous backfield, compared on
even terms with Bobby Grayson,
Bones Hamilton, and Frank Alus
tiza of Stanford.
Teams Compared
Oh, yes, we were originally speak
ing of Stanford's campaign to stop
Washington. The Indians figure this
way:
Washington has been scored on
by California. Oregon, and Ore
gon State, and their line, or for
that matter, their whole team, has
I never been considered defensively
invincible.
It would be hard to conceive of
the Stanford team that beat
U.C.L.A. 27 to 0 and U.S.C. 16 to 0
in easy fashion not being capable
of putting over at least one touch
down in 60 minutes against the Hus
kies.
Stanford will match Washington's
passing with a few sky tosses, both
lateral and forward. But the In
dians will rely for most of their
yardage on ground plays, including
the kind of straight power that has
been so successful to date.
Fullback Grayson will be called
upon for his usual quota ol "fade
away-cutback" plays over tackle.
This play has habitually given Gray
son just enough start to permit him
to gather speed, and it has offered
the interference just the right
amount of time to form. In other
words, the play has rarely failed to
click.
Then Hamilton, Van Dellen, and
Maentz will entertain with the usual
reverses to add necessary variety.
All of which is getting to the
point that Stanford will open up,
true, but she will do it with the
"same old stuff."
Stanford will try to stave off her
fourth consecutive defeat at the
hands of Washington, and the Hus
kies will have the incentive of their
first conference championship in
eleven years as a lure to greater
heights. So the psychological odds
are even.

It is a reasonably safe assump
tion that Stanford can halt any
Washington land attack. That will
leave passing.
The Huskies can and will pass, and
they may score by this route. How
ever, no one else since Santa Clara
has done so, and Coach Tiny Thorn
hill has had a chance to drill a lot of
pass defense into his backficld and
centers.
Huskies Can Pass
The Huskies have several aerial
plays that are hard to halt. They
include a snappy, bullet pass over
center to a man some ten or twelve
yards across the line of scrimmage.
The pass is figured to strike just as
the receiver begins to break.
Yesterday, with the varsity
working on defense and the third
string doing the tossing, Stan
ford's first string appeared rather
helpless on this particular play.
Washington will Rive this enough
variety by mixing in several well
calculated long passes, and plenty of
running.
Art Ahonen, clever fullback, docs
mosi. of the passing and kicking foi
the Seattle men, while Burl Bufkin
is the chief ball carrier. Socko Sul
kosky, who can be called on for a
few yards through the line con
sistently, is a good blocker, as is
Jay Hornbeak, foxy quarterback.
This is the personnel of Washing
ton's famous backfield, compared on
even terms with Bobby Grayson,
Bones Hamilton, and Frank Alus
tiza of Stanford.
Teams Compared
Oh, yes, we were originally speak
ing of Stanford's campaign to stop
Washington. The Indians figure this
way:
Washington has been scored on
by California. Oregon, and Ore
gon State, and their line, or for
that matter, their whole team, has
I never been considered defensively
invincible.
It would be hard to conceive of
the Stanford team that beat
U.C.L.A. 27 to 0 and U.S.C. 16 to 0
in easy fashion not being capable
of putting over at least one touch
down in 60 minutes against the Hus
kies.
Stanford will match Washington's
passing with a few sky tosses, both
lateral and forward. But the In
dians will rely for most of their
yardage on ground plays, including
the kind of straight power that has
been so successful to date.
Fullback Grayson will be called
upon for his usual quota ol "fade
away-cutback" plays over tackle.
This play has habitually given Gray
son just enough start to permit him
to gather speed, and it has offered
the interference just the right
amount of time to form. In other
words, the play has rarely failed to
click.
Then Hamilton, Van Dellen, and
Maentz will entertain with the usual
reverses to add necessary variety.
All of which is getting to the
point that Stanford will open up,
true, but she will do it with the
"same old stuff."
Stanford will try to stave off her
fourth consecutive defeat at the
hands of Washington, and the Hus
kies will have the incentive of their
first conference championship in
eleven years as a lure to greater
heights. So the psychological odds
are even.

of putting over at least one touch
down in 60 minutes against the Hus
kies.
Stanford will match Washington's
passing with a few sky tosses, both
lateral and forward. But the In
dians will rely for most of their
yardage on ground plays, including
the kind of straight power that has
been so successful to date.
Fullback Grayson will be called
upon for his usual quota ol "fade
away-cutback" plays over tackle.
This play has habitually given Gray
son just enough start to permit him
to gather speed, and it has offered
the interference just the right
amount of time to form. In other
words, the play has rarely failed to
click.
Then Hamilton, Van Dellen, and
Maentz will entertain with the usual
reverses to add necessary variety.
All of which is getting to the
point that Stanford will open up,
true, but she will do it with the
"same old stuff."
Stanford will try to stave off her
fourth consecutive defeat at the
hands of Washington, and the Hus
kies will have the incentive of their
first conference championship in
eleven years as a lure to greater
heights. So the psychological odds
are even.
Once upon a time the wolves did
I howl in Seattle town so they could
be heard way down to Tacoma. It
fell to the lot of some Redskins from
sunny California to quiet them.
Yessir, for three straight years,
the University of Washington alumni
wolves did follow one Jimmy Phelan
around baying their fool heads ofl.
And, for three straight years, the
Indians of Stanford administered
the anesthetic by presenting them
with gridiron victories.
Huskies Howl Now
Now, the wolves have calmed
down, and it is the Huskies that do
howl so they can be heard way down
to Pasadena. Once again it falls to
the lot of those Indians to install
the quietus, so a certain group of

Chanting "Stop Grayson,
Alusti/a and Hamilton," the
Washington Huskies, headed by
Jimmy Phelan, are en route
from Seattle to San Francisco
and will disembark in the city
tonight.
Phelan may bring his squad
to the Farm tomorrow after
noon for a trial run on the
Stanford Stadium turf l>eforc
meeting the Cardinals Satur
day afternoon.

people known as the Rose Bowl
Committee can get some sleep.
The Cardinals can, and probably
will, tame the Seattle canines Sat
urday in Stanford Stadium as the
two match power and passes in foot
ball combat.
Indians Capable
So the Washington Huskies will
leave for the Northwest Saturday
night a subdued group of Mala
mutes, and we can all go to bed and
wait for the Big Game.
That is the plot as explained on
the Cardinal practice field.
The Indians have several very
logical excuses for believing them
selves capable of beating Washing
ton's "best team since 1925."
Stanford has a football team
which has yet to be scored upon
via terra firma. No opponent lias
so much as threatened the Cardi
nal goal with ground plays.
It is a reasonably safe assump
tion that Stanford can halt any
Washington land attack. That will
leave passing.
The Huskies can and will pass, and
they may score by this route. How
ever, no one else since Santa Clara
has done so, and Coach Tiny Thorn
hill has had a chance to drill a lot of
pass defense into his backficld and
centers.
Huskies Can Pass
The Huskies have several aerial
plays that are hard to halt. They
include a snappy, bullet pass over
center to a man some ten or twelve
yards across the line of scrimmage.
The pass is figured to strike just as
the receiver begins to break.
Yesterday, with the varsity
working on defense and the third
string doing the tossing, Stan
ford's first string appeared rather
helpless on this particular play.
Washington will Rive this enough
variety by mixing in several well
calculated long passes, and plenty of
running.
Art Ahonen, clever fullback, docs
mosi. of the passing and kicking foi
the Seattle men, while Burl Bufkin
is the chief ball carrier. Socko Sul
kosky, who can be called on for a
few yards through the line con
sistently, is a good blocker, as is
Jay Hornbeak, foxy quarterback.
This is the personnel of Washing
ton's famous backfield, compared on
even terms with Bobby Grayson,
Bones Hamilton, and Frank Alus
tiza of Stanford.
Teams Compared
Oh, yes, we were originally speak
ing of Stanford's campaign to stop
Washington. The Indians figure this
way:
Washington has been scored on
by California. Oregon, and Ore
gon State, and their line, or for
that matter, their whole team, has
