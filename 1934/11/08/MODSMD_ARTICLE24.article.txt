# Indians To Pit Power Against Husky Passing
## Cards Depend on Grayson For Fast Offense In Saturday Tilt STANFORD CONFIDENT Thornhill Stresses Defense Against Air Attack 
### Millard Browne 
Once upon a time the wolves did
I howl in Seattle town so they could
be heard way down to Tacoma. It
fell to the lot of some Redskins from
sunny California to quiet them.
Yessir, for three straight years,
the University of Washington alumni
wolves did follow one Jimmy Phelan
around baying their fool heads ofl.
And, for three straight years, the
Indians of Stanford administered
the anesthetic by presenting them
with gridiron victories.
Huskies Howl Now
Now, the wolves have calmed
down, and it is the Huskies that do
howl so they can be heard way down
to Pasadena. Once again it falls to
the lot of those Indians to install
the quietus, so a certain group of

Chanting "Stop Grayson,
Alusti/a and Hamilton," the
Washington Huskies, headed by
Jimmy Phelan, are en route
from Seattle to San Francisco
and will disembark in the city
tonight.
Phelan may bring his squad
to the Farm tomorrow after
noon for a trial run on the
Stanford Stadium turf l>eforc
meeting the Cardinals Satur
day afternoon.

people known as the Rose Bowl
Committee can get some sleep.
The Cardinals can, and probably
will, tame the Seattle canines Sat
urday in Stanford Stadium as the
two match power and passes in foot
ball combat.
Indians Capable
So the Washington Huskies will
leave for the Northwest Saturday
night a subdued group of Mala
mutes, and we can all go to bed and
wait for the Big Game.
That is the plot as explained on
the Cardinal practice field.
The Indians have several very
logical excuses for believing them
selves capable of beating Washing
ton's "best team since 1925."
Stanford has a football team
which has yet to be scored upon
via terra firma. No opponent lias
so much as threatened the Cardi
nal goal with ground plays.
It is a reasonably safe assump
tion that Stanford can halt any
Washington land attack. That will
leave passing.
The Huskies can and will pass, and
they may score by this route. How
ever, no one else since Santa Clara
has done so, and Coach Tiny Thorn
hill has had a chance to drill a lot of
pass defense into his backficld and
centers.
Huskies Can Pass
The Huskies have several aerial
plays that are hard to halt. They
include a snappy, bullet pass over
center to a man some ten or twelve
yards across the line of scrimmage.
The pass is figured to strike just as
the receiver begins to break.
Yesterday, with the varsity
working on defense and the third
string doing the tossing, Stan
ford's first string appeared rather
helpless on this particular play.
Washington will Rive this enough
variety by mixing in several well
calculated long passes, and plenty of
running.
