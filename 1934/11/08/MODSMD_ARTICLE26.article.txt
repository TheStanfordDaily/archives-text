# Merriam â€” the Man With Responsibilities
## 
### 
Now that the tumult and the shouting have
died, and solid "American ideals" have tri
umphed in the sovereign state of California,
(iovernor Merriam should bless the citizenry
with an application to the immediate business
of government those "American ideals" so
slrongly professed by him; government recog
nizing the desires of the people of California,
rather than any privileged fraction thereof.
Although the majority of the people of
California voted for either t'plon Sinclair or
Raymond Haight, Frank Merriam has never
theless been elected governor of the state. This
means that Mr. Merriam has quite a job on
his hands, for the defeated elements in this
campaign are too large, 100 influential, too
sincere to be ignored. They must be reconciled
somehow.
Even if we assume that half or more than
half of Haight's vote leaned more toward
Merrrarn sympathy than toward Sinclair, there
slill remains a vast proportion of the California
voters who expressed a preference for govern
mental and economic principles directly op
posed to those of the sucessful candidate.
There have been minority governors and
minority presidents in the I'nited States be
fore. Usually the divergence of views between
the.winner and the loser has been slight. II
has not mattered if the victor followed his
own policies without concession or compro
mise.
This lime, however, the hundreds of thou
sands of people who voted for l T pton Sinclair
or Raymond Haight will not stand meekly by
while a reactionary Republican administration
rides roughshod over llieir dreams and hopes
of social reform. They are a factor to be
reckoned with in any future governmental
policies in California.
Fortunately, (lovernor Merriam, both before
Hie election and since his victory, has given
assurances that he intends to move forward
with the spirit of the times. Surprising though
such promises have been from the hitherto
reactionary Merriam, there is a strong possi
bility that he is sincere. And the Republican
party in California would be blind indeed if il
interpreted Tuesday's vote as a mandate to
continue along the lines that il has been
following.
There is little doubt that Merriam was
elected merely because he was the lesser of
two evils. Those who view his retention as
governor with satisfaction have Upton Sin
clair to thank for the fact, starangely enough.
If a democratic candidate in complete har
mony with the National Administration had
been nominated, he would probably have been
swept into office with the tide that car
ried the New Deal to victory throughout the
nation. ,
Therefore, if Merriam is to wield any sort
of influence he must compromise, he must
make concessions to the other side. He has
indicated thai his policies will be of a pro
ressive nature, providing for social and eco
nomic reform.
The jury, two million voters strong, awaits
the evidence.

Fortunately, (lovernor Merriam, both before
Hie election and since his victory, has given
assurances that he intends to move forward
with the spirit of the times. Surprising though
such promises have been from the hitherto
reactionary Merriam, there is a strong possi
bility that he is sincere. And the Republican
party in California would be blind indeed if il
interpreted Tuesday's vote as a mandate to
continue along the lines that il has been
following.
There is little doubt that Merriam was
elected merely because he was the lesser of
two evils. Those who view his retention as
governor with satisfaction have Upton Sin
clair to thank for the fact, starangely enough.
If a democratic candidate in complete har
mony with the National Administration had
been nominated, he would probably have been
swept into office with the tide that car
ried the New Deal to victory throughout the
nation. ,
Therefore, if Merriam is to wield any sort
of influence he must compromise, he must
make concessions to the other side. He has
indicated thai his policies will be of a pro
ressive nature, providing for social and eco
nomic reform.
The jury, two million voters strong, awaits
the evidence.
Now that the tumult and the shouting have
died, and solid "American ideals" have tri
umphed in the sovereign state of California,
(iovernor Merriam should bless the citizenry
with an application to the immediate business
of government those "American ideals" so
slrongly professed by him; government recog
nizing the desires of the people of California,
rather than any privileged fraction thereof.
Although the majority of the people of
California voted for either t'plon Sinclair or
Raymond Haight, Frank Merriam has never
theless been elected governor of the state. This
means that Mr. Merriam has quite a job on
his hands, for the defeated elements in this
campaign are too large, 100 influential, too
sincere to be ignored. They must be reconciled
somehow.
Even if we assume that half or more than
half of Haight's vote leaned more toward
Merrrarn sympathy than toward Sinclair, there
slill remains a vast proportion of the California
voters who expressed a preference for govern
mental and economic principles directly op
posed to those of the sucessful candidate.
There have been minority governors and
minority presidents in the I'nited States be
fore. Usually the divergence of views between
the.winner and the loser has been slight. II
has not mattered if the victor followed his
own policies without concession or compro
mise.
This lime, however, the hundreds of thou
sands of people who voted for l T pton Sinclair
or Raymond Haight will not stand meekly by
while a reactionary Republican administration
rides roughshod over llieir dreams and hopes
of social reform. They are a factor to be
reckoned with in any future governmental
policies in California.
