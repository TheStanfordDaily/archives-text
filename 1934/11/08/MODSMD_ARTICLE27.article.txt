The (ilobe Trotter, KPO's redoubtable radio
news announcer, slipped a cog yesterday when
he suggested that college journalism, as ex
emplified hy the Daii.y, was inaccurate. Mis
informed (Ilobe Trotter was completely in
error himself when he presumed that the
Daily said editorially that which in tact was
merely a Campus Opinion, written and signed
hy Hill Rogers, a student, who has no connec
tion with the Daily other than that of a sub
scriber.
And the (llobe Trotter must have erred still
lurth"- when he implied that Mill Rogers'
lads is staled in his opinion, were incorrect.
Rogers said that eggs were thrown at women
speakers at California, and that football
players stood by and watched. These facts
Rogers undoubtedly gleaned from the San
Francisco press, with which the (ilobe Trotter
is connected, (ilobe Trotter replies with a
smirk that the eggs were thrown at San Mateo
.1 iinior (College.
Funny thing, but hen fruit went Hying at
both institutions, this week.
