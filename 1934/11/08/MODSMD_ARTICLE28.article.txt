# Rouge and Lipstick
## 
### 
While the masculine world thunders op
probrium and hurls epithets and threatens
boycotts ineffectually, the fair se\ has found
a way to compter blood and iron Nazism. The
(iood Hook says a little lamb shall lead them;

lull the skirts are doing il with lipstick and
rouge.
In the beginning, the stern storm troopers
and Nazi police hustled beautiful women oil'
(ierman streets; the powder pull' was strictly
taboo. But so many handsome foreign women
insisted on their prerogative of make-up that
international relations became acute. Re
cently the desperate supreme Nazi council
ordered all molestation of foreign ladies lo
cease, and because they're all sisters under the
skin, Nazi officialdom found il hard to dis
tinguish the imported from the domestic
article.
So linally the word is to let them all alone;
and no matter how gaudily the femmes Haunt
their warpaint, a Nazi must eye them diffi
dently and let them pass.
