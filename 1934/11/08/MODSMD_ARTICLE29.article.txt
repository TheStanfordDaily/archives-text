# B.A.C. and the Rooter
## 
### 
Many are the individuals who Hock to the
R.A.C., to the Administration Building, and
thence lo the Daily office to register com
plaints on a certain matter of apparently
vital appearance. . •
Several registered students, bewildered, un
happy, report lack of registration cards for
future Indian gridiron contests —lost, strayed,
or stolen. Excuses vary: Wallets have been
pilfered, individuals have been careless, and
anyhow, there are some Stanford men and
women who won't be permitted to sit in the
Stanford rooting section this year unless
action is taken at once. Board of Athletic Con
trol members will not grant permission to
permit issuance of duplicate cards until a
meeting of the Board is called. The next
Board meeting will not be held until it is too
late for any action whatsoever this year.
Worried hunters of registration cards offer
the suggestion: Allow issuance of duplicate
cards to those who present duly notarized
certificates outlining the exact circumstances
surrounding the loss. Stanford still has an
honor code, despite failure of Men's Council
to let the freshmen know about it until this
week. So why not give them the break this
lime, and let'em watch Huskies and Hears bite
the dust?
