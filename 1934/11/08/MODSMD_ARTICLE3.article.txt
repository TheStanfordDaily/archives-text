WASHINGTON, Nov. 7 (/P).—
I Only a thinning line of vote-scarred
' Republicans emerged last night from
! the smoke of Tuesday's New Deal
| landslide to bring to national and
1 state capitals the smallest represen
tation that party has had since it
emerged as an infant from pre-Civil
| War strife.
There remained to Republicans
i the comfort of senatorial victories
iin Delaware, Michigan, Vermont,
and Maine; of governorships won
from Democrats in New Jersey and
Michigan and retained in California,
Kansas, New Hampshire, and Ver
j inont.
G.O.P. Hopes Dashed
Stand-pat Republicans found little
i to cheer about in the fact that in
dependently minded Senator Cut
banner in New Mexico, came down
j the vote-counting stretch nip and
j ting, fighting under a Republican
1 tuck with Democratic Dennis Cha
-1 vez. Nor was there much hand
clapping inspired among them by
the victory of Hiram Johnson, who
I bore lour standards in California.
In the House, where they had
hoped for substantial gains, G.O.P.
( leaders saw the Democrats making
I more inroads upon their territory.
1 beans had expected to pick up seats,
they had hard fighting to hold
ground, or even retreated.
Democrats Gain 6 Scats
With three-fourths of the returns
in, the Democrats had a net gain of
six seats. At that point, the count
; stood: Democrats, 308; Republicans,
77; Farmer-Labor, 3; Progressives, 7.
On the loss side, the Republicans
counted Pennsylvania, Connecticut,
Indiana, Missouri, New Jersey, Ohio,
Rhode Island, Maryland, and West
Virginia Senate seats; Nevada, North
Dakota, Oregon, and Pennsylvania
; governorships.
Stalwarts Missing
Missing from the roster of Re
publicans who emerged were Reed
of Pennsylvania, stalwart spokes
man of conservatism; Walcott of
i Connecticut, close friend of former
/President Hoover; Robinson of In
j diana, quick-speaking critic of New
Deal policies in the last Congress;
the wealthy Hamilton Kean of New
Jersey; one-time schoolmaster Sim
| eon D. Fess of Ohio, a keynoter for
the party at the convention which
! nominated Herbert Hoover. -
