'The Men's Rest Home is not receiving its
usual irafiic this quarter, doubtless because
there is some confusion among men students
concerning its funtion and operation. SulTer
ers from heavy colds or annoying coughs go
over to the Health Service, receive treatments
and return to the seclusion of their rooms
where Ihey are alternately overheated and
chilled.
In the Rest Home lliey receive proper care
and comfort at the moderate sum of one dollar
a day. Part of the cost of the Rest Home is
paid with the students fees when he registers,
and part is taken care of by the Mother's Club.
If the students unable to provide the dollar per
dium, the Mother's Club will also endeavor
to advance part of the sum.
Friendly atmosphere, and meals in bed if
you want! All the comforts .of home.
