## WITH EDWIN ANGELL COTTRELL 
### CEDRIC LARSON 
The Democratic tidal wave which swept the country
in the November 6 election gives that party the strong
est position in Congress any political group has enjoyed
since the reconstruction days of the Civil War.
Professor Edwin Angell Cottrell, chairman of the
School of Social Sciences and executive head of the
Department of Political Science, feels that this astound
ing Democratic victory may in itself develop into a
potential source of party dissension.
"If, as reported," states Professor Cottrell, "the
Democrats have won a two-thirds vote in each
house of Congress, there is the danger that Con
gress will over-run the President and get out of
control. Within the Democratic ranks are such
factional groupings as inflationists. the supporters
of the veterans' bonus, those who demand in loud
voice a balanced budget, and so on.
"When Congress convenes on January 3, it is pos
sible that as the session progresses, the national legis
lature may not see eye to eye with the President on all
matters of administration policy, and a rift will take
place. The Congress will grow out of hand, and nullify
the Presidential veto with its two-thirds vote.
"On the other hand, if Roosevelt can control
Congress, I feel he will hold to a middle-of-the
road policy, and not swing to tl* left, as many
people expect. There is the election of 1f)3(5 with
which he must reckon.''
Old Guard Republicans from the Atlantic to the
Pacific were .swept away in the avalanche of Democratic
ballots. Democrats ousted Republican senators in
Rhode Island, Indiana, Michigan, Connecticut, New
Jersey, Ohio, West Virginia, Maryland and Missouri.
Perhaps the bitterest pill of all for Republicans to
swallow was the downfall of Senator David A. Reed
of Pennsylvania, arch-foe to Roosevelt, with the elec
tion of the Democratic senatorial candidate, Joseph F.
Guffey. Other G.O.P.'s of the ancient regime who
were relegated to political oblivion quite unexpectedly
were Senator Fess of Ohio and Senator Hatfield of
West Virginia.
The good ship "Progressive," launched last spring
by the LaFollettes of Wisconsin, was sailing serenely
on the crest of a wave of popular approval at the
polls. Senator Robert M. LaFollette, asking for re
election, was sustained by a 3-2 lead over John B.
Chappie, Republican, and John M. Callahan. Democrat.
His younger brother, Philip LaFollette, was invested
with the office of state governor.
In Minnesota, the Farmer-Laborite, Floyd B. Olson,
was elected governor on a ticket which promised
thorough-going administrative reform, and a better
ment of conditions for the farmer.
The limelight of political interest was centered
on California in a fight between llpton Sinclair, his
EPIC plan, and Acting Governor Frank Merriam,
as Democratic and Republican gubernatorial can
didates, respectively. Merriam won by some quar
ter-of-a-million votes.
"Sinclair, in the eyes of his followers," said Professor
Cottrell, "seemed something of a Moses ready to lead
them into the promised land of EPIC. His adherents
were mainly malcontents and others who, for various
reasons, were dissatisfied with the existing regime.
On the other hand, I do not feel that Merriam will
inaugurate a reactionary program in view of the fact
that so many progressives came to his support in Ihe
fight for his election."

didates, respectively. Merriam won by some quar
ter-of-a-million votes.
"Sinclair, in the eyes of his followers," said Professor
Cottrell, "seemed something of a Moses ready to lead
them into the promised land of EPIC. His adherents
were mainly malcontents and others who, for various
reasons, were dissatisfied with the existing regime.
On the other hand, I do not feel that Merriam will
inaugurate a reactionary program in view of the fact
that so many progressives came to his support in Ihe
fight for his election."
The Democratic tidal wave which swept the country
in the November 6 election gives that party the strong
est position in Congress any political group has enjoyed
since the reconstruction days of the Civil War.
Professor Edwin Angell Cottrell, chairman of the
School of Social Sciences and executive head of the
Department of Political Science, feels that this astound
ing Democratic victory may in itself develop into a
potential source of party dissension.
"If, as reported," states Professor Cottrell, "the
Democrats have won a two-thirds vote in each
house of Congress, there is the danger that Con
gress will over-run the President and get out of
control. Within the Democratic ranks are such
factional groupings as inflationists. the supporters
of the veterans' bonus, those who demand in loud
voice a balanced budget, and so on.
"When Congress convenes on January 3, it is pos
sible that as the session progresses, the national legis
lature may not see eye to eye with the President on all
matters of administration policy, and a rift will take
place. The Congress will grow out of hand, and nullify
the Presidential veto with its two-thirds vote.
"On the other hand, if Roosevelt can control
Congress, I feel he will hold to a middle-of-the
road policy, and not swing to tl* left, as many
people expect. There is the election of 1f)3(5 with
which he must reckon.''
Old Guard Republicans from the Atlantic to the
Pacific were .swept away in the avalanche of Democratic
ballots. Democrats ousted Republican senators in
Rhode Island, Indiana, Michigan, Connecticut, New
Jersey, Ohio, West Virginia, Maryland and Missouri.
Perhaps the bitterest pill of all for Republicans to
swallow was the downfall of Senator David A. Reed
of Pennsylvania, arch-foe to Roosevelt, with the elec
tion of the Democratic senatorial candidate, Joseph F.
Guffey. Other G.O.P.'s of the ancient regime who
were relegated to political oblivion quite unexpectedly
were Senator Fess of Ohio and Senator Hatfield of
West Virginia.
The good ship "Progressive," launched last spring
by the LaFollettes of Wisconsin, was sailing serenely
on the crest of a wave of popular approval at the
polls. Senator Robert M. LaFollette, asking for re
election, was sustained by a 3-2 lead over John B.
Chappie, Republican, and John M. Callahan. Democrat.
His younger brother, Philip LaFollette, was invested
with the office of state governor.
In Minnesota, the Farmer-Laborite, Floyd B. Olson,
was elected governor on a ticket which promised
thorough-going administrative reform, and a better
ment of conditions for the farmer.
The limelight of political interest was centered
on California in a fight between llpton Sinclair, his
EPIC plan, and Acting Governor Frank Merriam,
as Democratic and Republican gubernatorial can
didates, respectively. Merriam won by some quar
ter-of-a-million votes.
