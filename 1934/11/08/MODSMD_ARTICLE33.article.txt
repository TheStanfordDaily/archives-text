## ABOUT THE PROPOSED L.I.D 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Because of the many misconcep
tions regarding the purpose of form
ing a chapter of the League for
Industrial Democracy at this Uni
versity, we would like to state
clearly our intents and reasons.
The primary purpose of the na
tional organization of the L.I.D. is
the education of our people in liberal
social principles. The motif of those
principles is the transition of our
society from one of profit to one of
use of the means of production.
If such a transition cannot come
peaceably and democratically, it may
come through more distasteful
means. We believe that the most

effective means of combating the
violence .of extreme radicalism is
education. If the education is re
fused or stifled, violence may become
unavoidable.
Any university sincerely devoted
to education will welcome the pres
entation of all points of view. We
wish to give education a chance.
Belief is made effective in terms
of organization. In order to better
support our American ideals of free
dom of speech, press, and assembly,
we wish to become a nucleus for
those who shun intellectual tree
sitting. We propose clear thinking
and democratic action.
