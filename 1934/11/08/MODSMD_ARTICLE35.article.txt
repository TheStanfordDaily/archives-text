# OLD BOY SPINS TALE
## 
### 
j The Editor, Sir-
Scouts for the Daily Stiff football
j team have been busy all week try
j ing to locate the Chappie team and
j the Chappies have been trying to
| locate a ball to practice with and
I another playerâ€”so they can have
| a man to run with the ball when
| the other two members of the team
I call names and signals. Evidently
! they have found something to prac
tice with. The Dailies have lost their
hot-water bottle. They went in
search of the Chappies and the bot
tle; now all three are lost. If any
one finds the bottle, please return,
the teams may be kept. In fact, they
would like to be kept.
The only clue to the whereabouts
of the Hammer and Coffiners was
the report that they were to practice i

a "spinner" play. If the play was
based on the "spin-the-bottle" form
ula, all hope is gone. If the "spin
ner" play is legal, then the gallant
Chappie lads are merely spinning
around until dizzy enough to run
around and around the Daily team.
Coach "All-American-from-Way-
Back" Steedman is endeavoring to
secure an appropriation from SERA
funds to buy new uniforms. "If this
is successful," he stated, "the Chap
pies will return. We can't play in
barrels."
