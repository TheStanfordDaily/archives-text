THE DARING YOUNG MAN ON
THE FLYING TRAPEZE and
Other Sturies. By William Saroyan.
New York: Random House. 1934.
$2.50.
Pardon a little shouting. But
shouting is imperative when you
run up against a book like this.
The thing that all of us are look
-1 ing for through the pages of the
i books we read is a personality with
|an original mind, expressively and
j triumphantly itself, and in being
thus fresh and alive, able to heighten
our own consciousness of life.
If you are weary of fruitless look
ing, keep your faith —at least as
| long as it takes you to beg or steal a
copy of "The Daring Young Man
|on the Flying Trapeze." There dis
! cover an astonishingly original mind,
j moreover an honest one, that will
! exalt and chill you, tickle, wallop,
and awe you. A daring young man,
, with something to say, is Saroyan—
'and that is the point:, he has some
\ thing to say and he makes you stop
j where you are and listen.
J This collection of short stories,
I contrapuntal propaganda,/ vignettes,
i and healthy introspection is the first
volume of a young San Franciscan,
tHe reveals his youth in his occa
j sional poor judgment, but more
j importantly in his electrifying inten
; sity. And he can write. He gets over
i his point; he may walk around it,
| building the emotion and idea, but
j he knows where he is going and he
i gets there with lucidity and a sword
i clash. The title story or "Aspirin Is
; a Member of the NRA" or "Myself
j Upon the Earth" v/ill convince you.
Sometimes he slips, of course,
i When he shows that he has been
j reading too much Sherwood Ander
| son and Gertrude Stein and is merely
• being clever, he loses his poignancy.
! But for the most part he is manag
! ing the trapeze with the greatest of
ease, really saying something about
I living, about youth thinking in a
I blurred world. And that is a good
I deal to find in an age where so
j many books are published and so
! little truth is written.

THE DARING YOUNG MAN ON
THE FLYING TRAPEZE and
Other Sturies. By William Saroyan.
New York: Random House. 1934.
$2.50.
Pardon a little shouting. But
shouting is imperative when you
run up against a book like this.
The thing that all of us are look
-1 ing for through the pages of the
i books we read is a personality with
|an original mind, expressively and
j triumphantly itself, and in being
thus fresh and alive, able to heighten
our own consciousness of life.
If you are weary of fruitless look
ing, keep your faith —at least as
| long as it takes you to beg or steal a
copy of "The Daring Young Man
|on the Flying Trapeze." There dis
! cover an astonishingly original mind,
j moreover an honest one, that will
! exalt and chill you, tickle, wallop,
and awe you. A daring young man,
, with something to say, is Saroyan—
'and that is the point:, he has some
\ thing to say and he makes you stop
j where you are and listen.
J This collection of short stories,
I contrapuntal propaganda,/ vignettes,
i and healthy introspection is the first
volume of a young San Franciscan,
tHe reveals his youth in his occa
j sional poor judgment, but more
j importantly in his electrifying inten
; sity. And he can write. He gets over
i his point; he may walk around it,
| building the emotion and idea, but
j he knows where he is going and he
i gets there with lucidity and a sword
i clash. The title story or "Aspirin Is
; a Member of the NRA" or "Myself
j Upon the Earth" v/ill convince you.
Sometimes he slips, of course,
i When he shows that he has been
j reading too much Sherwood Ander
| son and Gertrude Stein and is merely
• being clever, he loses his poignancy.
! But for the most part he is manag
! ing the trapeze with the greatest of
ease, really saying something about
I living, about youth thinking in a
I blurred world. And that is a good
I deal to find in an age where so
j many books are published and so
! little truth is written.
—James Broughton.
