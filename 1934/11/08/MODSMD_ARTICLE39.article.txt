# ENGLAND DESIRES PEACE RELATIONS, SAYS FAIRCLOUGH
## 
### John McClelland 
Back to the Farm after a three
months' stay in the British Isles
last week came Professor Emeritus
Henry Rushton Fairclough with new
views of Britain's economic situa
tion, new ideas of international gooc
will promotion, and sorrow at the
death of his former friend, King
Alexander of Jugoslavia.
Professor Fairclough for three
months has been participating in the
activities of the International Con
gress of Anthropologists and Eth
nologists in Scotland. Also repre
senting Stanford at the Congress was
Dr. Charles Vincent Taylor of the
School of Biology.
Meeting Well Attended
"Forty different countries were
represented at the congress," Dr.
Fairclough said. "And when such a
cosmopolitan group are associated
together for several weeks one of
the few practical methods of creat
ing international good will is pre
sented."
After the formal sessions of the
congress in Edinburgh, the members
were divided into parties which
toured many English cities for the
purpose of visiting the numerous
municipal museums. The tour also
afforded an excellent opportunity
for men to associate with the Eng
lish people and learn their stand
points. Citing his views, Dr. Fair
clough commented:
England Wants Peace
"Everyone wants peace in Eng
land, and I think our visist to the
various English cities did something
constructive in promoting peace.
The atmosphere in Britain is dis
tinctly more cheerful than it was
when I was abroad three years ago."
Some score or more persons, each
representing a different country,
were in the party with Dr. Fair
clough on their tour through this
country. This group elected the
Stanford man their spokesman and
called upon him to represent them
at the receptions with which they
were met at each city.
"One of the most noticeable things
about this group of foreign people
with which I traveled," Dr. Fair
clough stated, "was the admiration
which they expressed on every hand
of the tv/o great democracies —the
United States and Great Britain."
Helped Red Cross in War
On the day he arrived in the
United States Dr. Fairclough learned
of the assassination of King Alex
ander, a man whom he had come to
know personally during Red Cross
activities in Jugoslavia after the war.
The Stanford emeritus professor had
charge of all Red Cross work in the
Balkan area in 1918-19 and had fre
quent associations with Alexander,
then crown prince.
"Alexander was a well-meaning
man," Dr. Fairclough commented.
"He became a dictator simply be
cause there was no other alternative.
News of his death came as a blow to
me but the assassination was not un
expected. I don't believe, however,
Ihat the assassin and the faction be
hind him represented the true feel
ings of the Croats, the group blamed
for the king's death."
Toward the end of his stay in
England Dr. Fairclough was called
upon to speak at the Scottish-
American War Memorial services in
Edinburgh. The professor was ac
companied on his trip by Mrs. Fair
clough.

constructive in promoting peace.
The atmosphere in Britain is dis
tinctly more cheerful than it was
when I was abroad three years ago."
Some score or more persons, each
representing a different country,
were in the party with Dr. Fair
clough on their tour through this
country. This group elected the
Stanford man their spokesman and
called upon him to represent them
at the receptions with which they
were met at each city.
"One of the most noticeable things
about this group of foreign people
with which I traveled," Dr. Fair
clough stated, "was the admiration
which they expressed on every hand
of the tv/o great democracies —the
United States and Great Britain."
Helped Red Cross in War
On the day he arrived in the
United States Dr. Fairclough learned
of the assassination of King Alex
ander, a man whom he had come to
know personally during Red Cross
activities in Jugoslavia after the war.
The Stanford emeritus professor had
charge of all Red Cross work in the
Balkan area in 1918-19 and had fre
quent associations with Alexander,
then crown prince.
"Alexander was a well-meaning
man," Dr. Fairclough commented.
"He became a dictator simply be
cause there was no other alternative.
News of his death came as a blow to
me but the assassination was not un
expected. I don't believe, however,
Ihat the assassin and the faction be
hind him represented the true feel
ings of the Croats, the group blamed
for the king's death."
Toward the end of his stay in
England Dr. Fairclough was called
upon to speak at the Scottish-
American War Memorial services in
Edinburgh. The professor was ac
companied on his trip by Mrs. Fair
clough.
Back to the Farm after a three
months' stay in the British Isles
last week came Professor Emeritus
Henry Rushton Fairclough with new
views of Britain's economic situa
tion, new ideas of international gooc
will promotion, and sorrow at the
death of his former friend, King
Alexander of Jugoslavia.
Professor Fairclough for three
months has been participating in the
activities of the International Con
gress of Anthropologists and Eth
nologists in Scotland. Also repre
senting Stanford at the Congress was
Dr. Charles Vincent Taylor of the
School of Biology.
Meeting Well Attended
"Forty different countries were
represented at the congress," Dr.
Fairclough said. "And when such a
cosmopolitan group are associated
together for several weeks one of
the few practical methods of creat
ing international good will is pre
sented."
After the formal sessions of the
congress in Edinburgh, the members
were divided into parties which
toured many English cities for the
purpose of visiting the numerous
municipal museums. The tour also
afforded an excellent opportunity
for men to associate with the Eng
lish people and learn their stand
points. Citing his views, Dr. Fair
clough commented:
England Wants Peace
"Everyone wants peace in Eng
land, and I think our visist to the
