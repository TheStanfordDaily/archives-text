# Nab Man In Robles Case
## 
### 
PHOENIX, Ariz., Nov. 7 (/P). â€”
One of the several suspects orig
inally questioned in the kidnaping
of six-year-old June Robles last
spring was arraigned in Federal
Commissioner's Court today in
a surprise move by Department of
Justice agents on formal charges of
kidnaping and attempted extortion.
He was Oscar H. Robson, former
night club operator, who was held
under $50,000 bond. He was a former
schoolmate of the late victim's father.
Rohson was accuscd of writing
the 815.000 ransom letter to young
June's father, and Bcrnabc Robles,
her grandfather, containing in
structions as to how her release
might be effected.
After the girl was found at the
end of 19 days captivity in her "iron
grave" in the desert, Robson was one
of the suspects paraded before her.
She was unable to identify him at
that time, however.
At Tucson, where June was kid
naped en route rome from school,
Mrs. Mary Robson, mother of the
accused man, emphatically declared
today he had no connection with the
abduction.
Mrs. Robson, pioneer settler of
Tucson, said Oscar and his sister
were in Phoenix the day of (he kid
naping and he went to Los Angeles
soon afterward, as several persons
could confirm.
Authorities checked the hand
writing in the letter to Governor
Moeur with that on the ransome
note, and declared it was the same.
