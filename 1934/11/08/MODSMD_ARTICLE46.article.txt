### CEDRIC LARSON 
Cross-sections of life at Stanford
in 1934 will be gleaned by future
university-student generations by
referring to the master-index to
Volume 85 of the Stanford Daily
which has just been completed by
the staff of the University Library
under the direction of Miss Alice
Newman Hays, chief of the refer
ence division.
Topical in character, this index
covers the period February 15 to
August 23 of the current year.
About 4,000 entries were made on
some 2,000 cards. Thirty-three type
written pages 9 by 22 inches were
consumed in putting the index into
permanent form.
A.S.S.U. Leads
A.S.S.U. activities proved the
longest topic, with 78 lines. Sports
news counted heavily in the bulk of
this index: track, 77 lines; tennis,
42; swimming, 41; baseball, 33; and
basketball, 28.
Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur was the
most-interviewed man, with 29 ar
ticles written about him. Herbert
Hoover came. second with 14 ar
ticles. John Lyman was the most
written-of student with 11 lines of
reference.
"Bull Session" Filed
Dave Mellinkolf accounted for 23
lines required to index his '"Bull
Session.. High by-line honors were
carried off by Millard Browne, sports
writer, who had nearly a score of
signed articles to his credit. Frank
Orr placed second with 14 by-lines,
and George Wilson third with 13 by
lines.
The prize controversy of the year
was the famous Malloch-R.O.T.C.

debate, which drew 13 campus opin
ion letters, and bales of words in
edit column and articles.
Auto accidents totalled eighteen
for the period under consideration.
One issue of the Stanford Daily
was not indexed. The reference
reads as follows: "Daily. Issues. Spe
cial razz issue, May 14. (Not in
dexed)."
Miss Hays explains that as each
current issue of the Daily appears,
it is indexed.
