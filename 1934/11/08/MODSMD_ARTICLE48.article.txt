Tinkle Molehill, liis Buck
This afternoon at 3:30 o'clock the
great, big Daily machine will prac
tice in the Stanford Memorial Sugar
Bowl for their coming slaughter of
I the Chaparral staff.
I want to see every man on the
Daily Still eleven out there. We
are holding our traditional "at home"
practice with the Chaparral gentle
men as a "get together" for the boys
! on the two teams. I'm expecting my
| boys, the Daily Stiff players, to
behave like little gentlemen and
show the Chappie boys a "good
! time."
Last night's practice was terrible.
There was no spirit, no pep, no en
i thusiasm. What's the matter with
1 youse mugs? You must have been
training on toasted inarshmallows!
You're weak! You're flabby! You're
not getting your men!
Now I want that you should get
! out on the field this afternoon and
show some spirit!
These Chappie boys are greatly
underrated. They 11 make you look
sick! They'll make you look dead
on your feet! After all, youse lugs
aren't the galloping ghosts. So get
out there and show some LIFE!
