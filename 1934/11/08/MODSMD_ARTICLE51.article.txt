# Varsity and Frosh Basketball Teams Will Meet Tonight
## Game Expected To Bring Out New Stars, Test New Rules 
### Phil Duffy 
Winding up his several weeks of
coaching, Chuck Glasgow will to
night present ihe varsity and fresh
man basketball teams in a full
time, regularly officiated game which
will be reviewed by Coaches John
Bunn and Jimmy Bradshaw. The
game will commence at 7:30 o'clock
and will be played in the Pavilion.
Glasgow, a regular on the 1933
varsity basketball quintet and now
a graduate student, has been hold
ing practice three days a week for
both the varsity and frosh squads.
During this period he has iaught the
fundamentals of basketball, with
practice on defense, offense and
basic plays. Varsity Coach Bunn
and Freshman Coach Bradshaw, who
have been engaged in coaching
freshman football, will take over
the reins next Monday when regular
five-day-a-week practice will com
mence.
New Rules Tested
The game tonight will be mainly
for a reviewing of the individual
players in preparation for the first
squad cut which will probably come
the latter part of next week. Also,
the new center jump ruling will be
contrasted with the old rules in an
effort to see which are more effective.
Although the freshmen have it
over the varsity in height and in
dividual stars, the varsity is favored
to win the game because of their
fast break and ability to co-operate
in team play. The freshman five is
composed of stars from various high
schools who naturally find it difficult
to conform to the system used at
Stanford and to co-operate with one
another. However, by the time the
regular season starts all these dif
ficulties will be ironed out.
Card Varsity Small
Stanford's varsity squad, perhaps
the smallest in the Pacific Coast
Conference, will make up for this
difference in their fast break and
numerous high-scoring forwards.
The varsity five will try out their
fast break against the frosh tonight,
who will retaliate by getting the re
bound from the backboard and
showing up individually on the floor.
In practice this week Kenneth
Nobs has been showing marked im
provement in his center play, and it
is hoped that he will improve to the
extent that Wytze Gorter, who is
now holding down the center posi
tion on the varsity team, will be able
to go back to his regular forward
position. Ralph Mannion, Bill Quade,
and Ed Proctor have shown up well
in their forward berths. Tonight's
game will probably bring out many
more individuals who so far have
passed with little notice.
