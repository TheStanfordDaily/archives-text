TEN STARTERS
BACK FOR '35
! Eleven Stanford football players v/ill play against Washington in a
l crucial test of gridiron supremacy here Saturday. That is not significant.
But the fact that ten of those eleven may open against the Huskies
a year from today is worth something if one is considering Stanford's
prospects of a fair to middlin' team in the 1935 campaign.
Either Van Dellen or Maentz will be in the game at left halfback. Both
will be gone when graduation takes its toll next spring. Both have used
■ up their eligibility in collegiate football. But they both play one position,
j and there are ten other positions, all fortified by juniors, speaking in terms
of eligibility.
Right down the line—Keith Topping, Claude Callaway, Larry
Rouble, Wes Muller, Woody Adams, Bob Reynolds, and Monk Moscrip
—yes, and in the backfield, too—Bobby Grayson, Frankie Alusti/.a,
and Bones Hamilton. They'll all be back when September 15 rolls
around next fall.
What about Muller and Topping, you ask? You say Muller played
football in 1932? And Topping has been earning blocks around here for
three years?
BOTH ELIGIBLE
AND WILL RETURN
But Muller played football on the Gray team in '32, and this did not
count as a year of eligibility for him. He unquestionably has another
season of legitimate play.
And Topping's 1932 letter was in basketball, please note. He is
also permitted another year of football. He could graduate in June, but
from his own lips comes th,* message that he plans to delay getting
a degree until after the next football season.
All the rest are undeniably juniors, and they all have every intention
of playing some football in 1935.
It will be merely a problem, then, of keeping the first string in condi
tion and finding a suitable left halfback, together with a few capable
reserves for the remainder of the team, if the Indians want to claim dis
tinction equal to or superior to that of this year.
KEEPING CONDITION
IS NO EASY MATTER
Keeping the first string in condition will be more involved than it
sounds. It will mean careful vigil against injury; it will mean constant
battling of "going stale," the fate that has befallen many star sophomore
and junior athletes in their senior year; it will entail keeping the team
together to function as a unit; yes, and there will be many other little
problem? for Coaches Tiny Thornhill, Ernie Nevers, and Jim Lawson to
cope with.
The conditioning will be a much more serious problem than the
filling of the left halfback position. There is already a strong indica
tion that the practice field next September will be over-run with poten
tial left halfbacks, many of them very promising first-string candi
dates.
First of all, there will lie Johnny Reisner, as fast as any man on the
squtid, who has seen quantities of duty from his third-string position
already this season.
Then Shelly Bronstein, who came up from obscurity toward the close
of last season, only to receive a leg injury that kept him out of competition
all this year, will be back with two full years of eligibility.
FROSH STARS
MAY MAKE GOOD
Reisner and Bronstein will have lots of competition. Take Jimmy Coffis
of Jimmy Bradshaw's frosh team, for example. He is one of the smoothest
runners and safety men seen in these parts recently, and the left halfback
is called on to do the safety work under the Stanford system. Then there
is Bill Paulman, as good an all-around backfield man as Grayson, Alustiza,
or Hamilton were when they competed for the frosh. He plays fullback;
but with the wealth of backfield material, some jobs may be shifted about.
With many varsity men back and several capable frosh coming up,
the backfield positions will be several deep with reserve material as
next season opens.
At the ends, Moscrip and Topping will get relief from Jack Clark, Alex
Trompas, and several other present varsity squad members, not to mention
Grant Stone, Berneth Layer, and Bob Dakan of the frosh.
Muller will still have Alf Brandin and Nels Larsen contending with
him for first-string work, and the guards will be left reasonably intact.
The tackles will suffer from want of reserves, it appears at this stage of
the figuring. Ed Lettunich and Jack Drown, first substitutes for Callaway
and Reynolds, are both seniors, and the frosh are not as strong at these
positions as they are in some oiher departments.
All told, it appears to a slightly over-enthusiastic scribe that Stanford
may make it three years of Rose Bowl competition in successions, with all
due respect to Washington's Huskies and a certain football game Saturday
afternoon. —Millard Browne.
