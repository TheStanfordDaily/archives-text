# CARDINALS ASK ASSU TO BUILD BIG GAME PYRE
## Committees To Be Named Later; Wood Wanted For Construction 
### 
The Big Game Bonfire will again
flare as the Indians prepare fur their
annual grid tilt with the California
Bears. With the game little more
than two weeks away tentative
plans for the recently re-established
bonfire-rally are advancing rapidly.
Jones Heads Committee
Bob Jones, Cardinal committee
man, and John Mottram, Encina
sponsor, were appointed co-chair
men of the committee in charge of
the erection of the fire. As Mottram
was unable to act in this position,
Jones is at present sole chairman.
Although complete plans have not
as yet been definitely made, accord
ing to Jones, members of the various
committees will be announced some
time this week-end, after which defi
nite work will begin.
An annual event until last year,
when student body members voted
its discontinuance because of pro
hibitive expense, the reinstatement
of the bonfire in a modified form is
greeted with much favor, as was
evidenced by the overwhelming
vote for the move.-
Majority Favors Fire
Since the majority of the students
"favors the re-establishment of the
Big Game Bonfire to be built in one
day primarily by the class of 1938,
with the help of the Associated
Students," the co-operation of all
halls, fraternities, and sororities is
asked for and expected, Jones states.
"With only one day Cor actual con
struction this co-operation is im
perative," he added.
"Because funds contributed by the
A.S.S.U. are limited to one hundred
dollars," says Jones, "any informa
tion as to where materials of con
struction may be obtained gratis will
be most welcome to committeemen.
Especially great is the need for wood
of any description. Anyone know
ing the whereabouts of these essen
tial elements of a bonfire is asked
to call the A.S.S.U. offices to report
this information.
