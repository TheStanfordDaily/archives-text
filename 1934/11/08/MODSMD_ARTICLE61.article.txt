# Dwyer Challenges Little Tomorrow for Top Post
## 
### JACK NEWMAN 
The long - scheduled match be
tween Lawson Little, British and
American Amateur champion, and
Tom Dwyer, California Junior
champion, will finally take place to
morrow on the Stanford golf course.
At stake will be the number one
position on the Stanford golf team
that was automatically conceded
Little after his spectacular summer's
campaign. Dwyer won his right to
challenge by shooting two rounds of
even par in the qualifying round for
team positions. His first round sur
planted Little's match play 68 as the
course record. As for the winner
of the match, Little is naturally

favored to win, but observers believe
that Dwyer has a fair chance of up
setting the champion.
Expect Hard Fight
The attention that both are paying
fo their respective games is a sign
that the match will be exceedingly
hard fought. In practice last night,
Lawson Little looked exceedingly
good; his shots seemed hardly to
have changed since he annexed the
two major titles. They are very
long and have excellent direction.
However, he hits an occasionally
wild wood shot. This will probably
be overcome when he is under pres
sure.
Dwyer looks good, too, but he
does not seem to have quite the
confidence and assurance that Lit
tle has. liis shots are more con
sistent than Little's, but they are
a good deal shorter 011 the irons.
I Dwyer's woods should almost
match Little's.
So far as the attitude in which the
players are taking the match is con
cerned, Dwyer has a decided advan
tage. He is the underdog and has
everything to gain and very little
to lose. He knows that he has
equaled Little's best score on the
Stanford course, and possibly he can
do it again if it is necessary to win.
Little Has All to Lose
Little, on the other hand, is the
man on the pedestal and will have
trouble to keep from being knocked
off. The winner seems to be sure of
an easy time on the top of the ladder
until winter quarter qualifying, as
"Spec" Stewart in the third position
is busy with Jack Hoerncr this next
week-end and only after that match
is played can the winner challenge
the loser of the Little-Dwyer match.

However, he hits an occasionally
wild wood shot. This will probably
be overcome when he is under pres
sure.
Dwyer looks good, too, but he
does not seem to have quite the
confidence and assurance that Lit
tle has. liis shots are more con
sistent than Little's, but they are
a good deal shorter 011 the irons.
I Dwyer's woods should almost
match Little's.
So far as the attitude in which the
players are taking the match is con
cerned, Dwyer has a decided advan
tage. He is the underdog and has
everything to gain and very little
to lose. He knows that he has
equaled Little's best score on the
Stanford course, and possibly he can
do it again if it is necessary to win.
Little Has All to Lose
Little, on the other hand, is the
man on the pedestal and will have
trouble to keep from being knocked
off. The winner seems to be sure of
an easy time on the top of the ladder
until winter quarter qualifying, as
"Spec" Stewart in the third position
is busy with Jack Hoerncr this next
week-end and only after that match
is played can the winner challenge
the loser of the Little-Dwyer match.
