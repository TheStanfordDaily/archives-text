# Indian-Bear Frosh Teams To Clash At Berkeley Saturday
## Both Squads Defend Clean Slates; Elevens Given Even Chances 
### Warren Breed 
A note of determined optimism
hovers in the rival California and
Stanford Frosh dressing rooms. An
overgrown, now-mature young Bear
is set for a powerful young Indian
warrior.
Saturday both teams will meet
with an undefeated record to de
fend. Both have played five games,
Cal with 88 points scored to their
opposition's 6.
At the beginning of the season
the Berkeley boys were given an
edge over the Card frosh. On the
eve of the contest, however, if
there is any edge for the cubs it is
so slight as to be negligible. Both
teams took the U.S.C. Frosh by
one touchdown, and both smoth
ered San Mateo J.C.
Much has been said about the tre
mendous charging line of Clint
Evans, and his bone-crushing backs.
It is true that he has a powerful
line, and some fast and rolling backs,
but so has Jim Bradshaw here on the
farm.
Passes Arc Threat
Passes will without doubt be the
papoose threat for points. So far in
the season the long scoring drives
have been greatly due to the yardage
gained on forwards. It is hard to
conceive how the babes can be
beaten by any frosh team in the
country if they display the aerial
attack shown in the Trobabe game.
That 80 per cent record'of completed
tosses is something of a miracle in
modern football.
On the throwing end is Bill
Paulman, solidly built fullback.
He fires them short and as the
crow flies, usually traveling about
ten or fifteen yards across the line,
good for firsi downs. Snagging
them for completion are the half
backs and four good ends—Bernie
Layer, Bob Dakan, John Wyeth,
and Grant Stone.
Halfbacks Tom Collins and Jimmy
Coffis and Bill Paulman share in the
running plays. Paulman runs any
where—through the line or around
the ends—with reasonable success,
and Coffis and Collins are pre-emi
nently off-tackle and end-run men.
Ed Gillette at quarter is like a
l ock, in there calling the right plays,
and saves Coach Bradshaw from the
usual frosh coach nervous break
downs with his sagacious general
ship.
Regular Line Starts
Bradshaw's regular line will again
start with Heath at center; Holdridge
and McKinney at guards; Oberg
and Henningson at tackles; and

either Wyeth, Layer, or Stone at i
i ends.
Clint Evans' line will line up Sat- j
urday something like this: Sparks !
and Hay at ends, Langley and Pol- j
lack at tackles, Newton and Stockton j
at guards, and Captain Bob Her- j
wig at center.
In the backfield will probably be [
John Meek at quarter, Jack Howard >
and Perry Thomas at halves, and
Sam Chapman at full. The most j
feared Calcub back, Hampton Poole, I
was not able to get into the Glen- j
dale game Saturday because of a j
hampering shoulder injury. He may '
play Saturday, however, and packs j
freight-train drive right through the |
center.

teams took the U.S.C. Frosh by
one touchdown, and both smoth
ered San Mateo J.C.
Much has been said about the tre
mendous charging line of Clint
Evans, and his bone-crushing backs.
It is true that he has a powerful
line, and some fast and rolling backs,
but so has Jim Bradshaw here on the
farm.
Passes Arc Threat
Passes will without doubt be the
papoose threat for points. So far in
the season the long scoring drives
have been greatly due to the yardage
gained on forwards. It is hard to
conceive how the babes can be
beaten by any frosh team in the
country if they display the aerial
attack shown in the Trobabe game.
That 80 per cent record'of completed
tosses is something of a miracle in
modern football.
On the throwing end is Bill
Paulman, solidly built fullback.
He fires them short and as the
crow flies, usually traveling about
ten or fifteen yards across the line,
good for firsi downs. Snagging
them for completion are the half
backs and four good ends—Bernie
Layer, Bob Dakan, John Wyeth,
and Grant Stone.
Halfbacks Tom Collins and Jimmy
Coffis and Bill Paulman share in the
running plays. Paulman runs any
where—through the line or around
the ends—with reasonable success,
and Coffis and Collins are pre-emi
nently off-tackle and end-run men.
Ed Gillette at quarter is like a
l ock, in there calling the right plays,
and saves Coach Bradshaw from the
usual frosh coach nervous break
downs with his sagacious general
ship.
Regular Line Starts
Bradshaw's regular line will again
start with Heath at center; Holdridge
and McKinney at guards; Oberg
and Henningson at tackles; and

either Wyeth, Layer, or Stone at i
i ends.
Clint Evans' line will line up Sat- j
urday something like this: Sparks !
and Hay at ends, Langley and Pol- j
lack at tackles, Newton and Stockton j
at guards, and Captain Bob Her- j
wig at center.
In the backfield will probably be [
John Meek at quarter, Jack Howard >
and Perry Thomas at halves, and
Sam Chapman at full. The most j
feared Calcub back, Hampton Poole, I
was not able to get into the Glen- j
dale game Saturday because of a j
hampering shoulder injury. He may '
play Saturday, however, and packs j
freight-train drive right through the |
center.
A note of determined optimism
hovers in the rival California and
Stanford Frosh dressing rooms. An
overgrown, now-mature young Bear
is set for a powerful young Indian
warrior.
Saturday both teams will meet
with an undefeated record to de
fend. Both have played five games,
Cal with 88 points scored to their
opposition's 6.
At the beginning of the season
the Berkeley boys were given an
edge over the Card frosh. On the
eve of the contest, however, if
there is any edge for the cubs it is
so slight as to be negligible. Both
teams took the U.S.C. Frosh by
one touchdown, and both smoth
ered San Mateo J.C.
