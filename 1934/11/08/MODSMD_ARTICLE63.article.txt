When an ambitious team of sup
pressed football players gets its one
and only chance to perform in public j
against a powerful opponent, spec- i
I tators are sure to see a real fighting
( battle.
Saturday's preliminary game to
the Washington - Stanford tussle j
promises to be just such an en
| counter. Stanford's untried Grays i
clash with a squad of experienced
; California Ramblers in their annual
tilt in the Stanford Stadium at 11:15
| o'clock in the morning. Both Gray
i and Rambler teams are composed of
men who are not good enough to ;
i play varsity.
Vallejo Is Threat
Eddie Vallejo, Rambler halfback, i
will bear watching Saturday. Last |
j week, when the Cal team held
; Coach Alonzo Stagg's College of the !
| Pacific eleven to a 6-0 score, Vallejo's
j fast end runs and tackle slants were
j responsible for most of the yardage j
I gained. Bill Basham and Dick i
Sugars, rangy Bear ends, will come
, into the limelight, should the game !
take an aerial trend.
The local Grays have yet to play a !
game, but this fact doesn't signify |
lack of experience. Their principal
activity has been to act as cannon j
! fodder for the varsity big guns in j
scrimmage sessions.
Vigna To Be Watched
Joe Vigna, left half, should show
up well for the Grays and John j
Cambell, said by some to be the
best passer on the Coast, should j
shine in the hurling role. Coach ;
j Murray Cuddeback expects Walter j
Chouteau and Robert Munger, ends, ■
! to make a good showing in the pass I
! receiving positions.
