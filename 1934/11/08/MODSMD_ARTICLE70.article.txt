# CARD SOCCER MEN PLAY SAN MATEO J.C. ON SATURDAY
## 
### 
At mid-season in the intercollegiate
soccer conference, Stanford rests
1 well down the line in fourth place,
] with the mighty Dons of San j
Francisco and the strong Bulldogs of
1 San Mateo resting on the top of the
I heap.
Championship Hopes Gone
Hopes for the championship have
gone glimmering for the Cards, but 1
there still remain enough games to
1 give them a good chance of rising
up from the low place. San Mateo !
comes first, then Cal twice, and,
: lastly, San Jose. If Ivlaloney's men
i keep up the pace they started last j
Saturday they are conceded an even
chance of winning all the rest of
j their games.
Another injury blow struck the
' squad this week when A1 Navarro j
, was hurt to such an extent that he I
j is likely to be out for the rest of the i
| season. But the loss is practically
I compensated for by the return of
i Hank Eversole, just released from
the ineligibility list. Eversole can
I play either halfback or forward and j
] has had experience in both positions, j
Other players to return to the
1 squad this week were Ed Perko,
: goalie, and Bob Hall, halfback. Both j
will probably see first string action
soon.
Play S.M. Saturday
Saturday the Cards play the Bull
dogs at San Mateo. In the first game
the Curds played this year San Ma
teo won. But the score was small and
since then the Indians have improved
their play 100 per cent. Although
Stanford already has their eye on
the Cal series, they are not over
looking a chance to knock {he Bull
dogs from their top perch Saturday.
Maloney is giving his men a thorough
grooming this week in preparation
lor the game.
