| "KENTUCKY KERNELS"
At the Varsity
A jilted lover—careful plans to
j commit suicide by jumping into
water — dramatic frustrations by
j Wheeler and Woolsey with a fish
i net—and thus commences another

series of wild
antics by our
heroes, called in
this picture
"Kentucky Ker
nels." The end
ing is rather
trite, as Ken
tucky feuds have

furnished material for too many
comedies in the past. A cute baby,
j breaking glass at every conceivable
j opportunity, contributes m any
j laughs, and almost steals the show,
Noah Beery amusingly croons a
I pica for a kiss in a deep bass, and
j Mary Carlisle has a southern accent
j that is almost convincing.

[ "ONE MOKE RIVER"
| At the Mcnlo Theatre
j A good adaptation of John Gals
worthy's posthumously published
j novel, "Over the River." The picture
j has an all-English cast, and stars
! clever Diana Wynyard. Dealing

with the weak
nesses of the
English divorce
law system, the
picture is cli
maxed in a court
room scene that
contains some of
the best bits of

dramatic punch of the current sea
son. The* direction is subtle and
smooth; not until-the end of the
show does one realize that there is
no action in the entire plot.
—Brill.

Cement sacks are tilled after both
ends are sewed up.
