# Premier Announces New French Cabinet As Doumergue Quits
## Police, Guard Patrol Paris To Prevent Repetition Of Last Outbreak 
### 
PARIS, Nov. 8 (/P).- A tentative
cabinet that includes most of the
members of Premier Gaston Dou
mergue's truce cabinet, which re
signed today, was completed just
before midnight by Pierre Etienne
Flandin, Doumergue's successor as
Premier.
While heavy detachments of po
lice and mobile guards, patrolled
Paris to prevent repetition of the
evening's disorders, when thousands
massed before the Opera broke
through police linen to cry "down
v/ith the deputies," Flandin man
aged to fill all except one cabinet
post.
Hcrriot Gets Post
Edouard Herriot, leader of the
radical Socialist group that wrecked
the Doumergue government, was
assigned the post of Minister of
State without portfolio. He had
meen minister without portfolio and
vice-premier under Doumergue.
Other changes in the Doumergue
government that'fell after exactly
nine months of power, included the
following:
Senator Leon Berard, minister of
justice, instead of Henry Lemery;
Senator Marcel Regnier, minister of
interior, instead of Paul Marchan
deau; General Louis Philip Thomas
Maurin, minister of war, instead of
Marshal Henri Petain; Deputy
Georges Pernot, minister of public
works, the post the new premier
held under Doumergue.
Marine Undecided
Deputy Georges Mandel, minister
of communications instead of Andre
Mallarme, was shifted to the educa
tion department, displacing Aime
Bert hod. Yet to be filled was the
ministry of merchant marine, which
was occupied by William Bertrand
in the Doumergue government.
The parting shots Doumergue fired
at Herriot increased the political
bitterness and augmented fears that
riotixiq might follow the Truce
Government's overthrow.
Doumergue charged Herriot's
Radical Socialists with responsibility
for "the riots of February and the
death of the veterans who marched
unarmed to the Place de la Con
corde."
Refuses Premiership
So hot were the flames of party
hatred flaring up as Doumergue's
resignation this morning ended the
nine-months-long political truce
that Pierre Laval, Doumergue's
foreign minister and the cabinet's
chief neutral, refused President Al
bert Lebrun's request that he be
come premier.
