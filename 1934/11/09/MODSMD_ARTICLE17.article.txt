### CEDRIC LARSON 
Twenty years ago today, Novcm- (
her !), !!)14, the swirling waters of
the Indian ocean closed forever over
the battered hulk of the famous j
German cruiser, Emden, scourge of
Allied shipping in the Far East. Re
peated deafening salvos from the
G-inch gun.s of H.M.S. Sydney;
pounded the enemy craft practically '
to scrap-iron and driftwood before j
it was claimed by the waves.
Dr. Anthony Eugene Sokol, as- j
sistant professor of German, and a !
member during the war of the high \
command of the Imperial - Royal
Austro - Hungarian Navy, recalls j
vividly the thrill of pride which the i
daring exploits of the Emden fur- ;
nished to the high naval circles of
the Central Powers.
"For three months after the out- j
break of the World War in 1914, the t
Emden roamed elusivcly the ocean
lanes of the Far East, pursued re
lentlesply but in vain by ships of
the Allied powers.
"One hundred days she ranged
the seas, during which time she cap
tun d a score of merchantmen, de
stroyed cargoes of more than
$100,000.000 value, and sent .to the
ocean bottom a Russian cruiser and 1
a French destroyer. The Emden
was a light cruiser of .'{,593 tons, car
ried ten 4.1-inch guns, and had a
sailing speed of 24 knots.
"Captain von Mueller of the
Emden decided early in November, i
1914, to destroy the Allied radio sta
tion at Direction Island, of the
Cocoa Islands group. An SOS was I

sent out, however, upon the arrival
of the Emden. The Sydney, a Brit
ish cruiser of 5,400 tons, equipped
with eight 6-inch guns, and with a
sailing speed of 25.7 knots, picked up
the SOS, sailed southward, and
destroyed the German cruiser.
"The story does not end here.
A small party under Lieutenant von
Muccke had gone ashore. They
found themselves marooned. Their
comrades were slain or captured,
and their ship sunk. Thousands of
miles separated them from home.
"The Germans took possession of
the island, and fitted up a 97-ton,
three-masted ship, the Ayes ha, with
which they determined to cffect an
escape. Fifty sailors crowded
aboard, and proceeded to Padang,
Sumatra.
"Proceeding westward across the
Indiaq Ocean, they encountered the
German Lloyd steamer, Choisang, a
craft of 1,700 tons. They transferred
to this ship and sank the Aycsha.
In the Choisang, they sailed into the
Red Sea, and after numberless ad
ventures on land and sea, reached
Damascus, whence they went by
rail to Constantinople. Here they
met the chief of the German Med
iterranean fleet."
The brother of Dr. Sokol, Hans
Sokol, was a Linienschiffsleutnant
in the Austro-Hungarian navy, and
has written a series of volumes about
the naval contest between 1914-18
lor the supremacy of the Mediter
ranean. Copies of these are in (lu>
Hoover War Library.
