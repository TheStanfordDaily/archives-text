# Undefeated Papooses Face Favored Calcubs In Annual Battle
## OUTWEIGH STANFORD First Year Men's Last Win Over Cal in 1929 
### 
Anything is liable to happen to- i
morrow. Anything, at least in the '
Class of '38's Little Big Game to- |
morrow at Berkeley when the tough 1
Card Frosh meet the tougher Cal
Frosh. Kick-off will be at 2 o'clock.
Both elevens are undefeated, but j
both will not be tomorrow night, i
for when the rival frosh get together
every year there are plenty of fire
works, upsets, and scoring aplenty.
At game time, however, pre-season
performances would serve to make j
Clint Evans' cubs favorites. Frosh ,
inconsistency and absolute disregard j
for dope render that dope some- ,
what helpless.
IJig hurrahs from the Berkeley
camp say that their big-gun 215-
pound sprinter, Ilam Pool, has re
cuperated from the sliofilder ail
ment that left him idle last week
and will start at full. Claude Ev
ans, tackle who was also out last
week, is hack and in the fold.
It will be Bear running plays :
againSt Card passing plays. No team j
has been able to pile up the Cal I
steam rollers at the line of scrim
mage as yet, whereas no one has |
been able to knock down enough of
the Card passes either. The Cal line
has not been greatly overworked all
season, holding the opposition to six
points.
The farm yearlings are about due
for a win over the state boys. The
last time they won a Little Big Game j
was in 1929, and that was only by ;
won point. Coach Cline Evans is one
of the best coaches at U.C., and 1
certainly has the material this year, j
even though it is from the Troy j
back yard.
Coach Jim Bradshaw worked his ,
hoys on offense last night, with ,
Biir Paulman, Jimmy Coflis, and
Tom Collins carrying the ball.
Probable line-ups are as follows:
California Stanford
Sparks ler Layer
Evans ltr Henningsen
Newton lgr McKinney
Herwig c Heath
Stockton rgl Holdridge
Pollack rtl Oberg
Cotton rel Stone
Meek q Gillette
Howard Ihr Collins
Thomas rhl Coffis
Pool f Paulman
