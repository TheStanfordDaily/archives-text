California Ramblers Saturday. The
kick-off is scheduled for 11:15, pre

Cuddeback was reluctant to talk i
about the Gray's chances for vie-}

his only comment on the possible I
outcome of the meet. He did loosen i
up for a few minutes, however, to '
say a few words about the Rambler j

and those two ends, Basham and
Sugars, are rangy fellows that
might cause us some trouble," were
the extent of his remarks.
