# Huskies, Cardinals Both Confident; Indian, Bear Frosh Meet in Berkeley
## Washington Will Arrive At Noon, Work Out In Stadium Today STANFORD IS FAVORITE Conference Title, Pasadena Bid May Go To Winner 
### Millard Browne 
"Slop Bobby Grayson.
' "Smother Frankie Alustiza.
"Ship Bones Hamilton to the
' showers."
Breezes from the general direc
tion of San Francisco gently wafted
these battle cries toward the Farm
last night after the Washington
Huskies came ashore after a train
trip from Seattle, intent on really
doing all those things to the above
mentioned Cardinal backfield stars.
It will all take place in Stanford
Stadium tomorrow afternoon, start
ing at 2 o'clock.
Stanford started to counter with
a battle cry of her own, but
after looking over Washington
threats Sulkosky, Muczynski,
Nowograski, Lazarevich, etc., all
the Indians could say was "Ugh."
Then up spoke a more enthus
iastic Cardinal supporter with the
astounding remark, "Actions speak
i louder than a lot of words."
And that is the plan for tomor
row's Stanford - Washington game,
as both teams hope for big things.
Both Teams Need Win
The Big Game may still be the
Big Game, but for the ordinary foot
ball lover, this year's little tea party
between Stanford and the Univer
sity cf Washington will be big
i enough, for:
1. The winner in all probability
will get the. bid to play in Pasa
dena Rose Bowl oh New Year's Day.
2. The winner will be in a de
cidedly nice position to grab the
Pacific Coast Conference title.
3. The winner, whoever it be,
would also be in a good position to
finish the year with a perfect slate.
So the boys will be playing for
keeps tomorrow, and Washington
really means it when they mumble
about stopping Grayson, Hamilton,
and Alustiza. And Stanford is pretty
serious in worrying about Sulkos
ky, Nowogr . . ~ that is, Cain, Logg,
Bufkin, and party.
Huskies Work Out Tooday
"Midwest Jimmy" Phelan and all
his boys from the Northwest coun
try wiil drop down to the Farm
early and take a look at, and a brief
run on the stadium turf this after
noon. They are camped in San
Francisco at present, but will move
to Palo Alto in a group at noon to
day and bunk at the President
Hotel for tonight.
For once, it is Washington and
not Stanford who is praying for
clear weather tomorrow. Mud and
slush of the Seattle held have been
' factors during two of the last three
jjames that have .saved the Huskies,
then in the lower bracket of the
conference race, from Indian trick
ery. This time, however, the Card
inals have a strong straight power
attack, while the Malamutes of the
North will count heavily on passing
: for their major gains.
Stanford Favored
Almost universally conccdcd the
favored .spot because of *a superior
line, the Indians have shown every
indication of confidence, without
conceit.
They wound up practice last nigh!
iti cheerful manner, with the second
'string .-'living to give a replica of
the Washington plays and the start
in;.- team standing in the defensive
position. The Huskies use a shift
fundamentally copied after the
Notre Dame style and Murray
Cuddeback and Husky Hunt, Cai'd
scouts who have watched the Wash
ington team in action, report the
Huskies have mastered the shift and
click smoothly.
Cards Rest Today
Thornhill said there will be no
practice tonight. He is confident of
his team's condition, and believes
the complete rest until game time
will do the players more good than
would a limbering up workout.
Burl Bufkin, right half, does the
chief ball carrying in running plays.
He runs after the fashion of Cotton
Warburton and is a hard man to stop
if he is broken into the open. His
most usual method of getting into
the clear is to be on the receiving
end of a long forward pass.
Throwing these passes is Art
Ahonen, left wing. Ahonen does
the punting in this backfield. For
short bucks and heavy blocking
duty, Socko Sulkosky, fullback, is
rather handy. Jay Hornbeak does
the signal calling and additional
blocking from his quarterback post.
"No changes," said Thornhill yes
terday when questioned about his
starting line-up. But the questioned
left halfback position still remains a
toss-up between Buck Van Dellen
and Bob Maentz.
Black Replaces Adams
Bob Black will open at running
guard in place of Woody Adams.
Adams' soup diet, enforced while
his broken jaw was wired together,
did his condition no good, and a
mildly sprained ankle will add to
ihe other trouble in keeping him on
the sidelines during most of the
game.
There is still some doubt con
cerning the center position. Although
Wes Muller is named on the line-up,
Alf Brandin was working with the

Stanfords in practice yesterday af
ternoon, and he may get the call.
The starting line-ups include:
Stanford Pos. Washington
Moscrip LE Markov
Reynolds LT (c) Ullinj
Bluck LG Muchaj
Muller C Mondola
Rouble RG Shper
Callaway RT Bond
Topping RE Lazerevich
Alustiza Q Hornbeak l

Breezes from the general direc
tion of San Francisco gently wafted
these battle cries toward the Farm
last night after the Washington
Huskies came ashore after a train
trip from Seattle, intent on really
doing all those things to the above
mentioned Cardinal backfield stars.
It will all take place in Stanford
Stadium tomorrow afternoon, start
ing at 2 o'clock.
Stanford started to counter with
a battle cry of her own, but
after looking over Washington
threats Sulkosky, Muczynski,
Nowograski, Lazarevich, etc., all
the Indians could say was "Ugh."
Then up spoke a more enthus
iastic Cardinal supporter with the
astounding remark, "Actions speak
i louder than a lot of words."
And that is the plan for tomor
row's Stanford - Washington game,
as both teams hope for big things.
Both Teams Need Win
The Big Game may still be the
Big Game, but for the ordinary foot
ball lover, this year's little tea party
between Stanford and the Univer
sity cf Washington will be big
i enough, for:
1. The winner in all probability
will get the. bid to play in Pasa
dena Rose Bowl oh New Year's Day.
2. The winner will be in a de
cidedly nice position to grab the
Pacific Coast Conference title.
3. The winner, whoever it be,
would also be in a good position to
finish the year with a perfect slate.
So the boys will be playing for
keeps tomorrow, and Washington
really means it when they mumble
about stopping Grayson, Hamilton,
and Alustiza. And Stanford is pretty
serious in worrying about Sulkos
ky, Nowogr . . ~ that is, Cain, Logg,
Bufkin, and party.
Huskies Work Out Tooday
"Midwest Jimmy" Phelan and all
his boys from the Northwest coun
try wiil drop down to the Farm
early and take a look at, and a brief
run on the stadium turf this after
noon. They are camped in San
Francisco at present, but will move
to Palo Alto in a group at noon to
day and bunk at the President
Hotel for tonight.
For once, it is Washington and
not Stanford who is praying for
clear weather tomorrow. Mud and
slush of the Seattle held have been
' factors during two of the last three
jjames that have .saved the Huskies,
then in the lower bracket of the
conference race, from Indian trick
ery. This time, however, the Card
inals have a strong straight power
attack, while the Malamutes of the
North will count heavily on passing
: for their major gains.
Stanford Favored
Almost universally conccdcd the
favored .spot because of *a superior
line, the Indians have shown every
indication of confidence, without
conceit.
They wound up practice last nigh!
iti cheerful manner, with the second
'string .-'living to give a replica of
the Washington plays and the start
in;.- team standing in the defensive
position. The Huskies use a shift
fundamentally copied after the
Notre Dame style and Murray
Cuddeback and Husky Hunt, Cai'd
scouts who have watched the Wash
ington team in action, report the
Huskies have mastered the shift and
click smoothly.
Cards Rest Today
Thornhill said there will be no
practice tonight. He is confident of
his team's condition, and believes
the complete rest until game time
will do the players more good than
would a limbering up workout.
Burl Bufkin, right half, does the
chief ball carrying in running plays.
He runs after the fashion of Cotton
Warburton and is a hard man to stop
if he is broken into the open. His
most usual method of getting into
the clear is to be on the receiving
end of a long forward pass.
Throwing these passes is Art
Ahonen, left wing. Ahonen does
the punting in this backfield. For
short bucks and heavy blocking
duty, Socko Sulkosky, fullback, is
rather handy. Jay Hornbeak does
the signal calling and additional
blocking from his quarterback post.
"No changes," said Thornhill yes
terday when questioned about his
starting line-up. But the questioned
left halfback position still remains a
toss-up between Buck Van Dellen
and Bob Maentz.
Black Replaces Adams
Bob Black will open at running
guard in place of Woody Adams.
Adams' soup diet, enforced while
his broken jaw was wired together,
did his condition no good, and a
mildly sprained ankle will add to
ihe other trouble in keeping him on
the sidelines during most of the
game.
There is still some doubt con
cerning the center position. Although
Wes Muller is named on the line-up,
Alf Brandin was working with the

Stanfords in practice yesterday af
ternoon, and he may get the call.
The starting line-ups include:
Stanford Pos. Washington
Moscrip LE Markov
Reynolds LT (c) Ullinj
Bluck LG Muchaj
Muller C Mondola
Rouble RG Shper
Callaway RT Bond

It will all take place in Stanford
Stadium tomorrow afternoon, start
ing at 2 o'clock.
Stanford started to counter with
a battle cry of her own, but
after looking over Washington
threats Sulkosky, Muczynski,
Nowograski, Lazarevich, etc., all
the Indians could say was "Ugh."
Then up spoke a more enthus
iastic Cardinal supporter with the
astounding remark, "Actions speak
i louder than a lot of words."
And that is the plan for tomor
row's Stanford - Washington game,
as both teams hope for big things.
Both Teams Need Win
The Big Game may still be the
Big Game, but for the ordinary foot
ball lover, this year's little tea party
between Stanford and the Univer
sity cf Washington will be big
i enough, for:
1. The winner in all probability
will get the. bid to play in Pasa
dena Rose Bowl oh New Year's Day.
2. The winner will be in a de
cidedly nice position to grab the
Pacific Coast Conference title.
3. The winner, whoever it be,
would also be in a good position to
finish the year with a perfect slate.
So the boys will be playing for
keeps tomorrow, and Washington
really means it when they mumble
about stopping Grayson, Hamilton,
and Alustiza. And Stanford is pretty
serious in worrying about Sulkos
ky, Nowogr . . ~ that is, Cain, Logg,
Bufkin, and party.
Huskies Work Out Tooday
"Midwest Jimmy" Phelan and all
his boys from the Northwest coun
try wiil drop down to the Farm
early and take a look at, and a brief
run on the stadium turf this after
noon. They are camped in San
Francisco at present, but will move
to Palo Alto in a group at noon to
day and bunk at the President
Hotel for tonight.
For once, it is Washington and
not Stanford who is praying for
clear weather tomorrow. Mud and
slush of the Seattle held have been
' factors during two of the last three
jjames that have .saved the Huskies,
then in the lower bracket of the
conference race, from Indian trick
ery. This time, however, the Card
inals have a strong straight power
attack, while the Malamutes of the
North will count heavily on passing
: for their major gains.
Stanford Favored
Almost universally conccdcd the
favored .spot because of *a superior
line, the Indians have shown every
indication of confidence, without
conceit.
They wound up practice last nigh!
iti cheerful manner, with the second
'string .-'living to give a replica of
the Washington plays and the start
in;.- team standing in the defensive
position. The Huskies use a shift
fundamentally copied after the
Notre Dame style and Murray
Cuddeback and Husky Hunt, Cai'd
scouts who have watched the Wash
ington team in action, report the
Huskies have mastered the shift and
click smoothly.
Cards Rest Today
Thornhill said there will be no
practice tonight. He is confident of
his team's condition, and believes
the complete rest until game time
will do the players more good than
would a limbering up workout.
Burl Bufkin, right half, does the
chief ball carrying in running plays.
He runs after the fashion of Cotton
Warburton and is a hard man to stop
if he is broken into the open. His
most usual method of getting into
the clear is to be on the receiving
end of a long forward pass.
Throwing these passes is Art
Ahonen, left wing. Ahonen does
the punting in this backfield. For
short bucks and heavy blocking
duty, Socko Sulkosky, fullback, is
rather handy. Jay Hornbeak does
the signal calling and additional
blocking from his quarterback post.
"No changes," said Thornhill yes
terday when questioned about his
starting line-up. But the questioned
left halfback position still remains a
toss-up between Buck Van Dellen
and Bob Maentz.
Black Replaces Adams
Bob Black will open at running
guard in place of Woody Adams.
Adams' soup diet, enforced while
his broken jaw was wired together,
did his condition no good, and a
mildly sprained ankle will add to
ihe other trouble in keeping him on
the sidelines during most of the
game.
There is still some doubt con
cerning the center position. Although
Wes Muller is named on the line-up,
Alf Brandin was working with the

Stanfords in practice yesterday af
ternoon, and he may get the call.
The starting line-ups include:
Stanford Pos. Washington
Moscrip LE Markov
Reynolds LT (c) Ullinj
Bluck LG Muchaj
Muller C Mondola
Rouble RG Shper
Callaway RT Bond
Topping RE Lazerevich
Alustiza Q Hornbeak l
Van Dellen LH Ahonen
Hamilton RH Bufkin
Grayson F Sulkosky i
"Slop Bobby Grayson.
' "Smother Frankie Alustiza.
"Ship Bones Hamilton to the
' showers."
Breezes from the general direc
tion of San Francisco gently wafted
these battle cries toward the Farm
last night after the Washington
Huskies came ashore after a train
trip from Seattle, intent on really
doing all those things to the above
mentioned Cardinal backfield stars.
