# "Yellow Journalism" Again â€” But Why Be Proud?
## 
### 
"The Chronicle is franldij proud of its part
in the campaign which saved American insti
tutions in California," boasts that formerly
patrician Sail Francisco newspaper.
Such a statement would be very humorous
were it not so tragic in its implication. Either
The Chronicle has a very keen sense of humor,
which may easily be doubted, or else its ethical
sensibilities have been sadly (lulled the cam
paign, which might be deplored.
No person looking at the campaign with
even a three-day perspective can be at all
proud of the part that California's nfewspa
pers have played. The Chronicle is only one
of many offenders. The prestige that it once
enjoyed is the thing that has made its conduct
particularly conspicuous. With but few ex
ception, no California newspaper can view
with pride its part in the campaign. This is
a fact that these same newspapers will soon
conic to realize, whether they arc ever sincere
enough to admit it or not.
Personal abuse, hysterical nonsense, eva
sion of the main election issues, intimidation,
and fear-arousing predictions have been the
(laity portion served up by the newspapers of
the state ever since the campaign began. Yet
one newspaper, at least, is "proud of its part"
in such activities.
This is intended as no brief for Upton Sin
clair. There was good reason, ample reason,
to oppose his election on economic grounds.
But this fact is no justification for the rotten
deal which was stacked by the press of Cali
fornia. Newspapers wandered far indeed from
the aforementioned economic grounds. Into
the devious and ill-smelling bypaths of per
sonal recrimination, ridicule, and misrepre
sentation thev wended their way. And as a
final recourse they would turn to a ringing
plea in behalf of "American institutions." .lust
what they meant by the latter reference is not
quite clear but it seems that any sort of
change, however much it may be desired by
the masses, is a menace to "American institu
tions."
Perhaps it is best that Upton Sinclair was
defeated. The one legitimate charge against
him, the impracticability of his plan, is prob
ably true. But that is beside the point. The
significant thing is not that Upton Sinclair
was defeated but the way in which he was
de teated.
The Daily, for one, is neither "proud" of
The Chronicle's part in the campaign nor of
the attitude of the California press as a whole.

This is intended as no brief for Upton Sin
clair. There was good reason, ample reason,
to oppose his election on economic grounds.
But this fact is no justification for the rotten
deal which was stacked by the press of Cali

the aforementioned economic grounds. Into

plea in behalf of "American institutions." .lust

the masses, is a menace to "American institu

Perhaps it is best that Upton Sinclair was
defeated. The one legitimate charge against
him, the impracticability of his plan, is prob
ably true. But that is beside the point. The
significant thing is not that Upton Sinclair
was defeated but the way in which he was
de teated.
The Daily, for one, is neither "proud" of
The Chronicle's part in the campaign nor of
the attitude of the California press as a whole.
"The Chronicle is franldij proud of its part
in the campaign which saved American insti
tutions in California," boasts that formerly
patrician Sail Francisco newspaper.
Such a statement would be very humorous
were it not so tragic in its implication. Either
The Chronicle has a very keen sense of humor,
which may easily be doubted, or else its ethical
sensibilities have been sadly (lulled the cam
paign, which might be deplored.
No person looking at the campaign with
even a three-day perspective can be at all
proud of the part that California's nfewspa
pers have played. The Chronicle is only one
of many offenders. The prestige that it once
enjoyed is the thing that has made its conduct
particularly conspicuous. With but few ex
ception, no California newspaper can view
with pride its part in the campaign. This is
a fact that these same newspapers will soon
conic to realize, whether they arc ever sincere
enough to admit it or not.
Personal abuse, hysterical nonsense, eva
sion of the main election issues, intimidation,
and fear-arousing predictions have been the
(laity portion served up by the newspapers of
the state ever since the campaign began. Yet
