# Stanford, Ever Thoughtful
## 
### 
II may have been a depression, and "recov
ery" may still he something lo talk ahout next
week, hut when the Stanford Hoard of Trus
tees discovered that complete balancing of
the hooks for the past twelve months showed
the I niversity well out of the red, the first
tiling that Hoard did was to think of its own
charges.
Members of the Stanford faculty today will
he very happy to learn that they will receive,
in I'ncle Sam's latest greenbacks, one-half ol
the ten percent cut which all faculty members
drawing over SI,(MM) annually took last year.
While half isn't everything, the money
comes as a gilt from the gods, a welcome,
pleasant surprise. Darned funny, isn't it, that
a little gesture letting you know how Stanford
people really work for each other can make
you feel all sort of warm and tingling inside?
And we're not softies, either.
