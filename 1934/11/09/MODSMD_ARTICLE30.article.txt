We set' hv the papers that (lortrude Stein
is visiting I ho tinted States. She made an
auspicious beginning, healing the ship news
reporters to the draw by interrogating them
rather than being queried herself. Said she:
"Ft" no one asked :i question, what would the
answer be?" and the reporters are still puz
zling over it.
La Stein herself has been a human question
mark hovering over the American literary
scene for a quarter of a century. Most of the
time we could not quite fathom what she was
saying; but no doubt the keenness of our
literary appreciation had been dulled by a
daily fare <»t comic strips and cinematic sub
titles.
it has often been repealed that the greatest
story ever written was contained in two words,
".Jesus wept," bill literary technique has pro
gressed far since that was penned. We can
sec that it is a good deal easier lo grasp the
principle of the simple lever than it is lo be
familiar with that of the photo-electric cell.
Perhaps when ".Icsus wept" was spot news,

the plebeian masses had as great difficulty
understanding »• as they do now comprehend
ing Stein.
W'e do know that great writers have pro
fessed their debt t<> her; and though true com
prehension of her works is hevond lis, it is ac
cepted that she is a great and rugged per
sonality.
