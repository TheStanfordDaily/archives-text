# Red Cross Next Monday
## 
### 
Stanford begins charity activities for 1934-
Monday, when the Bed Cross committee
swings into action collecting membership con
tributions. The Bed Cross and the Convales
cent Home are the usual projects sponsored
by the Farm, under the very logical premise
that a large percentage of the student body is
able to contribute at least something to such
drives.
Laudable though the motives be for all
charily drives, a word of caution is in order
nl this time to committee chairmen who even
now arc planning some function which will
be advertised as a "charity" or "Convalescent
Home" benefit.
There are six traditional ways in which
Stanford collects money for charitable pur
poses. All of these have been proved effective
and worthy of Support. The Bed Cross drive;
Bean Day; Work Day; ping-pong contest;
Masque Ball with its attendant King and
Queen contests; and the customary collection
of Convalescent Home contributions in living
groups have been used before and have estab
lished their merit. These six ideas should be
sufficient for any well-planned charity drive,
and will prove more successful if used alone
than if the issues involved are clogged by
minor gestures which may tend to wear
threadbare that much-used term "charity."
Lest the Daily be misinterpreted: Last
year, every campus organization aiming at
a successful social affair, plus several San
Francisco hotels in search of student patron
age, joined forces under the Convalescent
Home bandwagon to disguise commercial
propositions as "charity" benefits. The Con
valescent Home, which received very little in
return from most of tltis tripe, naturally was
very happy to take anything it could get to
help a most worthy cause. But this time, the
Daily does not intend to let the graft continue.
The Bed Cross drive of next week is a fine,
well-balanced, and deserving movement. Offi
cial Convalescent Home benefits are of great
aid to one of Stanford's outstanding achieve
ments.
Chiselersâ€”beware!
