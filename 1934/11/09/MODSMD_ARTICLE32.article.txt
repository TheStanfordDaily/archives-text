NIRA vs. THE CONSTITUTION
With election again in the background and Roose
velt, New Dealers, et al in good mood over the huge
majority that the Democrats held and gained over the
nation, it is not at all improbable that the turbulent
question of the constitutionality of the NIRA will flare
up in courts throughout the country with new vigor.
There is little doubt but that for some time the
Attorney General's office has been delaying cases in
volving NIRA disputes. This for two reasons: (1) To
give the act sufficient time for a thorough economic
test; and (2) To wait until the administration is put
into a good humor by a vote of confidence of the
nation (i.e., Tuesday's election) before risking the
chance of incurring administrative wrath by inciting
court decisions which could not be counted on to
uphold NIRA so strongly as in the past.
At present in the country there are cases and
cases involving code disputes pending in halls of
justice ranging from the numerous district courts
to the Supreme Court. Action may lie expected
soon. And the decisions handed down can hardly
he expected to be entirely on the side of the
government.
There have been numerous lower court NIRA dis
pute cases tried during the last year and the constitu
tionality of the act was upheld, if not in the first trial,
then in the appeal trial which invariably resulted, in
almost every instance.
It is not unnatural that the situation should have
been as it was. Upholding the Constitution of the
United States is a serious matter, and there are few
lower court judges who will take it upon themselves
to declare any national law unconstitutional. Even
the all-powerful Supreme Court will not pass on
such a case without a majority of the judges on the
bench.
Seemingly getting a raw deal because of this
attitude are the industrialists who, in many cases,
arc being severely handicapped by NIRA codes.
They feel that the Constitution of the United States
is such as will uphold their individual rights and
therefore cannot be blamed for being bitter when
they lose case after case lighting NIRA.
A review of some of the court cases held recently
raises a serious doubt as to whether the government
really is acting constitutionally in curbing certain in
dustries and whether the courts are fair in always
plumping on the side of the codes.
Last February, for example, there was brought
before a district court of Texas the case of the Amazon
Petroleum Corporation versus the Railroad Commis
sion of Texas. The oil men attacked the validity of an
act of Congress known as the National Industrial Re
covery Act. Their production and distribution of oil
was being curtailed by provisions regarding inter-state
commerce in NIRA's oil code.
The old company's attorneys laid before the
court seven ways in which the code was violating
seven different amendments of the Constitution.
But that wasn't enough. The judge declared: "It is
the sacred duty of the judiciary (o support, main
tain and give full effect to the Constitution against
every act in violation of it."
A similar case regarding the production .if oil was
tried in Texas last May. This time the district court
declared NIRA unconstitutional and the oil men won
the case. But immediately the defense appealed to the
circuit court where the decision was reversed and the
case sent back to the district court to have the action
affirmed.
These cases are typical. If a man is accused of
violating a code and wins his case in a lower court, he
is almost sure to run up against a wall in the higher
courts.
It is up to the supreme court to set a precedent.
There are NIRA cases which will come up before the
supreme body soon. If it dares to declare NIRA in
whole or part unconstitutional, then lower courts are
likely to abandon their habitual tendency of upholding
the Constitution in every instance, and industrialists
can feel they will be given an even break when they
take constitutional disputes, NIRA or otherwise, into
justice halls.
