# BULL SESSION
## 
### 
Faced with a problem, U.C.L.A.
throws a "red scare," Berkeley
thiows uncooked eggs, and San Jose
throws the bull. In each of these
cases, there have been whisperings
of "Communism" (the twentieth
century's No. 1 scare-word). In
each of these cases, there have been
some who felt compelled to do some
thing about these whisperings. And
since it is always easier to jump than
to think, California collegians have
treated the yellow press to some of
ils choicest tidbits in many months.
Those of us who do not believe
in Communism, but still are not af
flicted by blood-shot eyes and the
chills whenever the name "Com
munism" is so much as mentioned,
do not think that U.C.L.A., or Berke
ley, or San Mateo, or San Jose and
the rest have even attempted to
solve thejr problem in the intelli
gent or university way.
Those who decide to face "red
scares" with brains and not with
bile, must consider first: "Will we
solve our problems in the American
and legal way, or will we throw
legality overboard, and let the mob
rule?" If it is decided that Amer
icanism and the "rule of law" are
inadequate, that is an overwhelming
indictment of the American system.
This column believes that the courts
of the nation (though they are
sometimes bad), are still better tri
bunals than the mobs which last
winter swarmed in St. James Park,
and this winter swarm around
Sather Gate.
For those who are inclined to
countenance or encourage the
squelching of minority opinions, let
them look abroad to where "the
light to squelch" has superseded
"the right to speak," and ask them
selves if that is desirable.
Further, let them ask themselves
(as a prominent and intelligent Re
publican has suggested) if all of their
beliefs and opinions are majority
opinions. For unless they run with
the herd at all times (as only the
dull do), it is a dangerous precedent
to establish: that of suppressing a
particular minority opinion be
cause it is not their own.
If the Constitutional system is to
be preserved, then the cracking
down process must come only when
activity runs definitely counter to
law. When Communists hold a
peaceful and legal meeting, that
must be tolerated. When the Amer
ican Legion holds a peaceful and
legal meeting, that should be toler
ated. But when Communists or
Legionnaires or Berkeleyites incite
to riot, in the interests of justice,
the power of the law must inter
vene. And mobs are not invested
with the power of law.
There will be more "red scares."
But university men and women
should know better.

rule?" If it is decided that Amer
icanism and the "rule of law" are
inadequate, that is an overwhelming
indictment of the American system.
This column believes that the courts
of the nation (though they are
sometimes bad), are still better tri
bunals than the mobs which last
winter swarmed in St. James Park,
and this winter swarm around
Sather Gate.
For those who are inclined to
countenance or encourage the
squelching of minority opinions, let
them look abroad to where "the
light to squelch" has superseded
"the right to speak," and ask them
selves if that is desirable.
Further, let them ask themselves
(as a prominent and intelligent Re
publican has suggested) if all of their
beliefs and opinions are majority
opinions. For unless they run with
the herd at all times (as only the
dull do), it is a dangerous precedent
to establish: that of suppressing a
particular minority opinion be
cause it is not their own.
If the Constitutional system is to
be preserved, then the cracking
down process must come only when
activity runs definitely counter to
law. When Communists hold a
peaceful and legal meeting, that
must be tolerated. When the Amer
ican Legion holds a peaceful and
legal meeting, that should be toler
ated. But when Communists or
Legionnaires or Berkeleyites incite
to riot, in the interests of justice,
the power of the law must inter
vene. And mobs are not invested
with the power of law.
There will be more "red scares."
But university men and women
should know better.

Faced with a problem, U.C.L.A.
throws a "red scare," Berkeley
thiows uncooked eggs, and San Jose
throws the bull. In each of these
cases, there have been whisperings
of "Communism" (the twentieth
century's No. 1 scare-word). In
each of these cases, there have been
some who felt compelled to do some
thing about these whisperings. And
since it is always easier to jump than
to think, California collegians have
treated the yellow press to some of
ils choicest tidbits in many months.
Those of us who do not believe
in Communism, but still are not af
flicted by blood-shot eyes and the
chills whenever the name "Com
munism" is so much as mentioned,
do not think that U.C.L.A., or Berke
ley, or San Mateo, or San Jose and
the rest have even attempted to
solve thejr problem in the intelli
gent or university way.
Those who decide to face "red
scares" with brains and not with
bile, must consider first: "Will we
solve our problems in the American
and legal way, or will we throw
legality overboard, and let the mob
rule?" If it is decided that Amer
icanism and the "rule of law" are
inadequate, that is an overwhelming
