# CAMPUS OPINION
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
We feel that the three individuals
who wrote the most deplorable let
ter to the "Campus Opinion" yester
day are not worthy of the name of
Stanford gentlemen. Since when has
it become necessary for the true
Stanford "gentlemen" to use the
coluems of the Daily as a "dating
bureau?" We deplore these chicken
hearted conditions. Is there a true
Stanford gentleman at our
sity who would not immediately
avail himself of the opportunity to
enjoy association with the "lovely
brunette" but who must faint-heart
edly procure the services of a "dis
interested intermediary?"
P.S.: Did he get a date?
C. McC., P.C., P.D.
The Editor, Sir:
This is just a note to thank the
three gentlemen for their inquiry.
I'm afraid, however, that it is no
use. I've just spent two hours go
ing through etiquette books trying
to find the proper way to address
three unknown gentlemen. I even
tried it from another angle â€” by
looking up how to address three un
known men through a disinterested
intermediary, but still no success.
Emily Post thought of enough
things; you'd think she'd include an
important item like that!
Very sincerely,
The one and only
Brunette in White
