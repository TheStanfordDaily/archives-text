"HIDE-OUT"
At the Varsity
Robert Montgomery is not an ac-
I tor; he is a personality of the play
' boy type, and therefore it is ex
ceedingly difficult to imagine Mr.
I Montgomery as a crook hiding from
the police. In fact, there are times
l when Bob forgets his tough accent,
i and speaks in a polished English
quite untypical of the part. Despite
the previous mentioned fault, there
! are many witty lines making up for
Montgomery's miscast. Many will
think "Hide-out" good entertain
ment. —Gruenberg.
