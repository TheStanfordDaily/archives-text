# "THE BARRETS OF WIMPOLE
## 
### 
STREET"â€”At the Stanford
Norma Shearer as Elizabeth Bar
rett faces the difficult task in this
. picture of equalling the memorable
performance of Katherine Cornell.
Under the cii'cumstances she suc
i ceeds admirably, giving as capable
and sympathetic a portrayal in her
own medium as did Miss Cornell in
! hers. In one respect only is she sur

passed. Naturally frail, Miss Cornell
was able to appear more convincing
as a bedridden poetess than the
robust Miss Shearer.
It is Charles Laughton who im
presses us most, however. Restrain
ingly sensuous, he makes Edward
Barrett a revolting and pitiable old
man. Fredric March is refreshing as
Robert Browning, and Uno O'Con
nor is good as Wilson, the cockney
maid.
Some wag on the Stanford campus
cast a blank ballot Tuesday.
