### 
LONDON, Nov. 8 (/P). —Japan to
night stood as pat as ever on her
demand for equality on the high
seas.
Japanese delegates, here for tri
power naval conversations, have de
cided tentatively not to accept in
formal British proposals intended
to break the existing deadlock, even
though these proposals went far
toward embodying Tokyo's scheme
for new methods of limiting navies,
it was learned authoritatively.
Name Proposals
A formal reply may be delayed
until next week, however.
The British proposals, presented
when the two delegations met yes
terday, were briefly as follows:
1. The principle of Japan's right
to equality would be recognized, but
Nippon would promise not to exer
cise that right.
2. Japan's plan for limiting navies
on the total tonnage basis would
be adopted, but limitation by cate
gories and by number of ships, 'as
in the Washington and London
treaties would continue.
3. The Japanese demand for re
ducing or abolishing offensive ships
would be toned down.
U. S. Balks
As hostile to the compromise plan
as the Japanese, though for dif
ferent reasons, are the American
delegates, Norman H. Davis and
Admiral William H. Standley, who
have fought for retention of the
principles of the Washington and
London pacts which Japan means to
denounce.
