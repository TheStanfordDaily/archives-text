## Slanina, Brauns Return To Campus Wednesday 
### 
Two former Stanford students,
Robert Brauns and Frances Slanina,
will return to the campus Wednes
day with the Thornton Shakespear
ean Company.
Sponsored by the English Club,
the company, which is the first pro
fessional group to appear at Stan
ford in two decades, will offer a mat
inee, "The Taming of the Shrew,"
and an evening performance of
"King Lear."
Both Prominent
In the afternoon presentation, Miss
Slanina will play the hostess and
Brauns will portray the servant
Biondello. In the evening Brauns
will play Oswald, steward to Gon
eril, one of Lear's daughters.
Both Miss Slanina and Brauns
have acted in productions at the Palo
Alto Community Theatre. Miss Sla
nina had the title role in "The Melt
ing Angel"; and Brauns took leading
parts in "Secret Service," "The
Ship," and "The Critic," which was
staged and directed by James San
doe last autumn quarter.
Active on Campus
On the campus, Miss Slanina has
been chiefly identified with plays
sponsored by the Spanish depart
ment. She was an assistant in the
department for two years, from 1932
to J 934, and is considered by Pro
fessor Aurelio M. Espinosa 'a most
brilliant student." Miss Slanina had
established a reputation for acting
at the University of Ohio, which she
attended before coming to Stanford.
Brauns was an active member of
both Sword and Sandals and the
English Club. Last year he directed
the readings of the O'Neill series,
played the lead in "George Barnwell,
or The London Merchant," and had
the main role in Arthur Schnitzler's
"The Affairs of Anatol," the first
Masquers production of the year.
Brauns Directed
During summer quarter, he di
rected and took part in the three
Sword and Sandals readings: "The
Circle," "The Rivals," and "L'Aiglon"
by Rostand. Interpreting the title
role in "L'Aiglon," he gave what is
generally considered to have been
his best reading of last year. The
character, the son of Napoleon, is
difficult—a dual personality, com
bining the inherited traits of domi
nation of an Emperor father and the
weakness of a Habsburg mother. In
this reading, Miss Slanina played op
posite Brauns.
An actor of great versatility,
Brauns emphasizes sincerity as the
keynote of his acting. Although
capable of tragedy, he has a definite
flair for comedy. His comic charac
terizations have often won the day.

Besides being assistant manager
for the Thornton company, Brauns
plays Mercutio in "Romeo and Ju
liet' and Gratiano in "The Merchant
of Venice." Miss Slanina's principal
part in the repertoire of the com

Venice."
Both Miss Slanina and Brauns ac
quired Shakespearean experience on
the campus in the "Romeo and Ju
liet" production directed last year
by Harold Hclvenston.

Keeble's in Palo Alto and at the
Stanford Bookstore.
Two former Stanford students,
Robert Brauns and Frances Slanina,
will return to the campus Wednes
day with the Thornton Shakespear
ean Company.
Sponsored by the English Club,
the company, which is the first pro
fessional group to appear at Stan
ford in two decades, will offer a mat
inee, "The Taming of the Shrew,"
and an evening performance of
"King Lear."
Both Prominent
In the afternoon presentation, Miss
Slanina will play the hostess and
Brauns will portray the servant
Biondello. In the evening Brauns
will play Oswald, steward to Gon
eril, one of Lear's daughters.
Both Miss Slanina and Brauns
have acted in productions at the Palo
Alto Community Theatre. Miss Sla
nina had the title role in "The Melt
ing Angel"; and Brauns took leading
parts in "Secret Service," "The
Ship," and "The Critic," which was
staged and directed by James San
doe last autumn quarter.
Active on Campus
On the campus, Miss Slanina has
been chiefly identified with plays
sponsored by the Spanish depart
ment. She was an assistant in the
department for two years, from 1932
to J 934, and is considered by Pro
fessor Aurelio M. Espinosa 'a most
brilliant student." Miss Slanina had
established a reputation for acting
at the University of Ohio, which she
attended before coming to Stanford.
Brauns was an active member of
both Sword and Sandals and the
English Club. Last year he directed
the readings of the O'Neill series,
played the lead in "George Barnwell,
or The London Merchant," and had
the main role in Arthur Schnitzler's
"The Affairs of Anatol," the first
Masquers production of the year.
Brauns Directed
During summer quarter, he di
rected and took part in the three
Sword and Sandals readings: "The
Circle," "The Rivals," and "L'Aiglon"
by Rostand. Interpreting the title
role in "L'Aiglon," he gave what is
generally considered to have been
his best reading of last year. The
character, the son of Napoleon, is
difficult—a dual personality, com
bining the inherited traits of domi
nation of an Emperor father and the
weakness of a Habsburg mother. In
this reading, Miss Slanina played op
posite Brauns.
An actor of great versatility,
Brauns emphasizes sincerity as the
keynote of his acting. Although
capable of tragedy, he has a definite
flair for comedy. His comic charac
terizations have often won the day.
Tickets on Sale
Besides being assistant manager
for the Thornton company, Brauns
plays Mercutio in "Romeo and Ju
liet' and Gratiano in "The Merchant
of Venice." Miss Slanina's principal
part in the repertoire of the com
pany is Nerissa in "The Merchant of
Venice."
Both Miss Slanina and Brauns ac
quired Shakespearean experience on
the campus in the "Romeo and Ju
liet" production directed last year
by Harold Hclvenston.
