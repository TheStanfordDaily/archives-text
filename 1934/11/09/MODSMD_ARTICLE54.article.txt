## JUST TWO MORE CHANCES 
### 
Bill Ingram and the University of
California have just two more
chances to come through this year.
They play U.S.C. in Olympic Sta
dium tomorrow, and they have an
appointment with Stanford on. No
vember 24 in Berkeley. The wolves
are already screaming, and think of
the fun they would have if the Gold
en Bears should bobble both of these
two big chances. Which is rather
probable.
California should beat Troy to
morrow. But the people at Ber
keley are wondering whether they
are glad or sorry the T/'ojans are
the downtrodden group of "used
to-be's."
If the Bears do win, what of it?
It will not prove that California has
finally developed a football team.
But, on the other hand, if Howard
Jones' team were as good as usual,
the Bears probably would be beaten.
So California is in the same posi
tion that Stanford was in the Rose
Bowl game last year—everything to
lose and nothing to gain. All we
have to say is "Poor Bill Ingram,
Poor Cal, Poor Big Game," if U.S.C.
wins tomorrow.
