# BRUINS SHOULD STAGE UPSETS
## 
### 
Twice already this year U.C.L.A.
has been in a good position to upset
some of the "big ones." The Bruin
met California while the Bears were
worrying about Washington, and
they met Stanford while Tiny Thorn
hill's football team was recuperat
ing from the Trojan game and just
a week before the Washington tilt.
Bill Spaulding's "little sisters"
have another golden opportunity to
upset a favored team this week-end.
On Monday the Bruins will meet St.
Mary's. Next Saturday, the Gaels
play Santa Clara in their annual big
game. So the Gaels naturally must
think ahead, and take it somewhat
easy Monday.
