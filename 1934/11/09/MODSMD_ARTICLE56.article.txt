# FROSH, VARSITY POSITIONS REVERSED
## 
### 
When Stanford meets Washington
tomorrow, the Indians will rely on
power for its heavy scoring. The
Huskies, on the other hand, will use
lots of passes, and most of the
Seattle hopes for a touchdown are
on the Washington aerial power.
Stanford's freshmen play Cali
fornia in Berkeley at the same time,
and the yearling position is re
versed. Stanford will use passes,
lateral and forward, and consider
able trickery in trying to defeat the
young Bears. The .California frosh
plan straight power as the best rem
edy for Indian dreams.
