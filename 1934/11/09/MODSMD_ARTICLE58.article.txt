# LITTLE, DWYER VIE FOR HONOR
## Contestants To Tee Off At 1:15 O'clock 
### 
With the champion and the chal- j
lenger resting yesterday and going
through only light practice before j
the match, the public of the Bay j
Region prepared to witness the first
match play appearance of Lawson
Little, international golf champion, |
who goes into action this afternoon ,
in an attempt to hold his number j
one Stanford golf team position in |
the face of Tom Dwyer's chal- j
lenge.
Public Interested
At the golf shop and Board of
Athletic Control numerous calls j
have been coming in to find the time j
and place of the match which has ,
attracted wide attention in the vicin- ,
ity. Coach Twiggs yesterday stated i
that all the members of his golf ;
classes will be expected to attend !
the match. The contestants will tec ;
off about 1:15.
Though Dwyer's record is not near
ly so formidable as Little's, the match ;
is apt to be closer than ariy figures j
or comparison of past triumphs j
would indicate. They are both tied !
for the Stanford course records with I
68's, though Dwyer's was recognized !
as the official due to the fact that
his score was made in medal play \
and Little's was made in an informal j
match.
Records May Fall
There has never been a match in j
which the possibility of the Stan- !
ford Amateur Course's record being
broken was greater. Both men have j
smashed the long standing course '
record that Bud Eighelberger, Char- j
ley Seaver, and Malcolm McNaugh
ton set many years ago.
Over 500 are expected in the gal- i
lery because of the wide attention 1
that the match has attracted. Dwyer I
and Little have both postponed the
match several times due to the \
priority of academic work.
