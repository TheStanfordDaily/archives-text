"The only thing husky about the 1
Washington team Saturday will be '
their voices. Stanford will win: |
20-7," said Sylvestre J. Drofnats j
as he mushed into the Daily office |
behind an Eskimo pooch.
"The dog is a great musher," said |
the sports predicter. "He got that
way from reading magazine ce
reals."
"Well, why are you so sure Wash
ington will lose?" asked the sports
editor.
"Oh, I just have a Phelan," re
plied the veteran. "California is
going to beat S.C. 13-G. The Cali
fornia team hasn't had a chance to
neck during the football season,
and when they see some of those
Hollywood beauties they won't
miss a tackle."
"The Class of '38 is fit to be tied;
so the score of the California-Stan
ford frosh game will be 21-21. This
stupendous ace prediction is ex
clusive in the Daily. Do not accept
any substitutes."
"California is not playing its
first string on the varsity, but is
keeping all their best men on the
Ramblers. The coach figures the
varsity schedule is too tough for
his good men, and he doesn't want
to tire them out. The score of
the Grey-Rambler game will be:
Cal Ramblers 20, Stanford Greys
0."
