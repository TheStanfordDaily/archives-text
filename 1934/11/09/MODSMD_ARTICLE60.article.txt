### 
In a slow but convincing manner
the varsity basketballers defeated
the frosh 28-20 last night in the
basketball pavilion. The game
started off with much speed by both
teams. The varsity ran up four
points almost as soon as the game
started, but the frosh then ran up
five to gain the lead for the only
time during the game. However,
they did show up well coming from
behind several times to almost gain
the lead. The ha-lf ended with the
varsity ahead, 13-7.
At the beginning of the second
half the frosh made four points but
the varsity soon made nine. From
then until the end of the game the
varsity had control of the situation.
The most outstanding player was
Luisetti of the frosh.
The starting line-ups and individ
ual point scores were: Varsity —,
Turner 2, Bost 3, Gorter 6, Mal
latratt 3, and Lindsey 1; Frosh—
Lyon 2, Luisetti 13, Zonne 3, Bieg
ler, and Lee.
