# Weary Bears Will Fight to Beat Trojans
## Card U.C. Frosh Meet In 'Little Big Game' 
### Phil Duffy 
In decided contrast to 'the battle
for supremacy of the Pacific Coast
Conference between Washington and
Stanford is the game between Cali
fornia and U.S.C. at Los Angeles to
morrow.
Â«- The California Bear, with his hide
bearing the imprint of many cleated
feet gathered in a so-far-unsuc
cessful season, will endeavor at all
costs at least to win over the Trojan
team that has also been the doormat
for several Coast teams this season.
I vast year a growling Bear on
the short end of long odds held the
Troy men to a 6-3 count. Cali
fornia should have won that game,
hut the fact that they scored a
field goal 'and then fell hack on
the defensive was instrumental in
their final defeat.
The Trojans, resting for two weeks
after the stinging Stanford defeat,
will not be heavy favorites in this
game. They will be favored slightly,
however. The game is really a toss
up with two cellar teams battling to
regain a little of their lost prestige.
In the North two somewhat im
portant games will be played to
morrow. At Pullman, Idaho invades
the Washington State Cougar
grounds with dire threats to blast
Coach "Babe" Hollingbery and his
men out of their top position in the
Pacific Coast Conference and at the
same time avenge their close 14-6
defeat of last year. Idaho, defeated
by Gonzaga 24-30, hopes to do the
same as the Bulldogs and surprise
(he Cougars. Hollingbery, however,
makes it a point to "never lose on
your home field."
In Portland traditional rivals
will hold sway, when the Uni
versity of Oregon meets Oregon
State College. The former will
he favt>red hut only because of
past records. Last season the
Webfeet were victorious over
the Staters 13-3. This game pro
vides a chance for an upset. Wash
ington defeated Oregon 16-G and
Oregon State 14-7, which makes
it pretty even.
In the Memorial Stadium at Ber
keley the Little Big Game will pro
vide plenty of thrills for the fans
would could not make the trip to
the South. The Bear Cubs will be
favored but odds mean nothing to
the Cardinal yearlings who have a
powerful attack that can play havoc
wilh the California Frosh. Neither
team has been defeated; both have
played five games. The Cal Babes
have averaged 27.2 points a game
and the Stanford Papooses have an
average of 25.6 points a game, a
difference that will be erased in to
morrow's game.
Another clash of minor import
ance finds Montana and Montana
State playing in Butte. The former
won 32-0 last season and should
have no difficulty in repeating.
