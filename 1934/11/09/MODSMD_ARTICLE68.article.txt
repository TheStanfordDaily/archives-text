# Rallymen Schedule Hat Stunt for Tomorrow
## 
### 
Plans for a rooting section of over
2000 for the Stanford-Washington
gridiron tilt tomorrow afternoon in
the Stanford stadium have been an
nounced by the Rally Committee.
Although there will be no card
stunts, a hat stunt will be given and
all men will be required to wear
their red and white rooters' hats in
order to gain admittance to the
rooting section. The hats are still
on sale at Wideman's in Palo Alto.
The Stanford women rooters will
fringe the men's rooting section, with
student body cards their only requi
site for admission.
