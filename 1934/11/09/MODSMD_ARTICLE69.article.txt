# MOLEHILL LAMBASTS DAILY STIFF LADDIES
## 
### Tinkle Molehill

I quit. I won't go on. It is more
than flesh and blood can bear! Such
humiliation! Such disgrace!
I won't coach the Daily Stiff team
fur their annual big game with the
Chaparral staff, unless I can find
them by big game time tomorrow.
The trouble started yesterday af
ternoon in our joint practice with
the Chappy team in the stadium.
The boys looked almost alike. Here
were millions of fine, upstanding
youths, the flower of Southern Chis
elry, and I couldn't tell which ones
were mine!
I must positively know which is
my team soon. The suspense is ter
rible. I'm going crazy! I'm going
nuts! I'm going bolts! Ramember,
whoever I coach must play for the
Daily. Money doesn't glow on
trees, you know.
For general information I would
like to announce to- my many fans
that tomorrow there will be only
one showing of the feature attrac
tion: The Chappy-Daily Game. For
the benefit of the customers who
come in late, only the preliminary
Stanford-Washington game will be
shown twice â€” once, before the
Daily-Chappy game, and once after
wards.
