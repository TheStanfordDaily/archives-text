From mosque, palace, and bazaar |
come the many oriental rugs mak- \
ing up the valuable collection of
Dr. Cal l Fremont Brand, professor
of history.
Professor Brand does not keep his (
collection in storage, but puts it to
practical use. Besides covering the j
floors of his residence, lie utilizes I
fine types as wall pieces, window j
decorations, tapestrieg, and lounge
coverings. In KJ2S, Dr. Brand spent
several weeks in Istanbul, then Con
stantinople, in the interests of his
avocation.
"There are four ch!ef lypes of
oriental rugs," states Dr. Brand.
"Persian rugs which are most re
fined in design and balanced in fcol
| or; Turkish rugs, less well designed
! than Persian, but more barbaric with
glowing masses of color; Caucasian
and Central Asiatic rugs, both of
which kinds are usually geometrical
in design." Dr. Brand possesses
many specimens from each cate-1
gory.
Dr. Brand explains that a good I

| Persian rug i,s hard to procure. It
is made by hand and has from (iO
lo 100 knots to the square inch.
Camel bags, on which Persians lav
ish much skill and which are somc-
I what similar to rugs in design, have
<100 knots to the square inch. Some
of the finest rugs of the 16th cen
! tury have over 1000 knots to the
I square inch.
Sometimes the date of manufac
j turo is woven into the rug. Profes-
Aor Brand has one thus dated 17!)').
and several that go back to the early
18th century. He treasures in his
collection some of the rare Bok
haras, woven by the fierce Turko
man tribesmen of Central Asia.
He also possesses some valuable
prayer rugs, weird in design and
filled with the cryptic symbols of
Islam. Professor Brand, who is an
expert on oriental rugs, states that
although fragments of rugs from the
third century A.D. have been dis
covered, the golden age in Persian
i rug weaving was in the 15th, 16th,
I and 17th centuries.
