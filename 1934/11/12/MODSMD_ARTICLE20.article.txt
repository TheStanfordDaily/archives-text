# Arizonans In Dam Dispute
## 
### 
PHOENIX, Ariz., Nov. 11 (/P). —
More than 100 Arizona National
Guardsmen were ready tonight for
instant mobilization, awaiting orders
from Governor B. B. Moeur to move
into the martial law zone declared
by the chief executive on the Ari
zona side of the Parker Dam site on
the Colorado River yesterday.
Meanwhile, . Governor Moeur
awaited "some word from Wash
ington" before following up the
martial law proclamation with
movement of troops.
"It's a show-down this time," the
Governor said. "We are going to get
something, or we aren't. And if we
can't expect anything we want to
know it before this project is far
ther advanced."
The chief executive indicated he
expected Secretary of Interior Har
old Ickes or President Roosevelt to
halt construction on a temporary
bridge at the dam site until some
assurance is given Arizona that the
proposed contract with the federal
government for half of the power
generated at the dam will be signed.
Approval of the proposed contract
protecting Arizona's rights to waters
of the Colorado would settle the
controversy which has been waged
spasmodically for more than a dec
ade, since it provides that Arizona
"will not interfere by litigation or
otherwise" with construction of
Parker Dam.
