# Red Squads Win Over Whites in 10-4 Victory
## 
### 
Displaying the best brand of polo
ever seen around here in such oarly
season competition, two Red aggre
gations alternated against two White
squads to finally win 10 to 4. in the
second weekly intersquad polo
scrimmage last Friday afternoon on
the highway field.
Each set of horsemen played four
chukkers in the first full-length
seven-and-a-half minute period con
test the local poloists have staged
this season. Midseason form was dis
played with flashing, rid inn, power
ful, clean mallet work, and efficient
team play in evidence,. especially
with the first Whites and Reds. A
hard-riding White aggregation sur
prised the small gathering of spec
tators by decisively out-hitting and
out-playing Ll. Haydon Y. Grubb'.>
varsity first Reds to score four goals
to the varsity's two in the four pe
riods which they played. The sec
ond Red team, though, were too
classy for the White opposition and
they ran up an 8-0 lead that cinched
the final score in favor Oi the two
Red teams.
Paul Engle springs the. present
younger set to the fore in poetry
with his collection of "American
Song."
