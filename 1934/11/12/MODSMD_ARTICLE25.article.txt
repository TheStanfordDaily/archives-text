# Cards Smash Husky Rose Bowl Threats With Decisive Score
## Grayson Stops Washington Passes; Intercepts Two for Goals 
### Millard Browne 
The team without a weakness.
11' that does not describe Stan
ford now, it is apt to when the In
dian football players meet Califor
nia November 24.
Jimmy Phelan and the Huskies of
Washington, with a team they were
some little proud of, thought they
had heard about some Stanford
weaknesses, and they played these
for all they were worth.
Result: Stanford weaknesses 21,
Washington 0.
Some report got out and traveled
way up to Seattle that Stanford's
All - American fullback, Bobby
Grayson, was helpless in defending
against a good passing attack. So
Washington fired some 21 forward
tosses Saturday afternoon in Stan
ford Stadium.
Lots of them went in Grayson's
direction. But he couldn't reach more
than three. Two of these he ran
back to touchdowns, and the third
he batted to Buck Van Dellen, who
ran out to midfield, to end the first
threat on the Cardinal goal since the
Oregon State game.
It was Stanford's "weakness"
that added to the score, but it
was the same old Indian strength
— a running attack — that really
beat Washington's ''best team in
nine years."
Stanford scored twice in the sec
ond period, again in the third, and
once more on the last play of the
final quarter.
Alustiza and Art Ahonen of the
Huskies staged a two-man punting
duel during most of the first period,
and very little else took place. At
the close of this period, another
Cardinal "weakness" —punt return
ing—came into prominence as Van
Dellen opened the drive to the first
score by returning Ahonen's kick
nearly to midfield. •
Then the typically short, con
sistent running plays were put to
work for the Indians and but five
plays into the second period found
the ball on the 18-yard line of
Washington.
Jim Moscrip booted the ball from
placement, with Alustiza holding,
squarely between the posts from a
slight angle to make the count
Stanford 3, Washington 0.
That was just the start of a bad
afternoon for the Seattle folks.
Washington promptly fumbled a
moment later and Larry Rouble re
covered on the Washington 20. Three
plays yielded nothing, and Moscrip
again attempted a kick, which went
wide.
Taking the ball on the 20 again,
the Huskies passed on first down.
Grayson, the pass defense weakling,
grabbed it on the 35, romped down
the sidelines, cut back and dived
over the goal. Mos<^ - ip converted.
Huskies Fumble Kick-off
Washington fumbled the third pe
riod kick-off after returning it to
her 20-yard line. It was Keith Top
ping who found himself draped over
the ball this time. Three downs pro
duced five yards, and the ball was
given to Hamilton on a reverse.
Bones slithered through for a first
down on the six-yard line.
Grayson hit right tackle for three,
and then gave the ball to Hamilton
for the touchdown. Moscrip again
added the point and the victory was
turned into a rout, 17 to 0.
Four First Downs
Washington wasn't beaten yet, and
the Phelan men took the kick-off on
the 20 for four first downs to the
Stanford 14-yard line, the famed
Husky passing attack finally click
ing. Another touchdown pass went
-our, however, and Alustiza, the
Owl-Eyed Basaue of the Cardinal
