# Armistice Day — Will There Be Two?
## 
### 
With new war scares popping on every
major front, the world yesterday celebrated
the sixteenth anniversary of the signing of
I he Armistice which marked the end of "the
war to end war."
The World War probably did not end war
despite Ihe idealistic purpose of Woodrow
Wilson's well-meant phrase. On the other
hand, though, the fact that the psychology of
fear is gripping Europe and that so-called
responsible leaders are doing their best to
further the hysteria does not necessarily mean
that the world is going completely insane
again in the near future.
Oil the face of things it would seem that
sixteen years is not a long enough interval
between the world's lapses from rationality.
Sixteen years is a mighty short time for an
entirely new crop of 'ools to have grown up.
There still should be a large proportion of the
people of western nations who lived through
and experienced the horrors of war.
The sad and disheartening fact about the
whole situation, though, is that the people
who were supposedly of adult intelligence
sixteen years ago have either forgotten or
never learned the lesson that the last war
might have taught. They are the very ones
who are responsible for the war scares and
jingoistic statements that scream from the
newspapers today at all too frequent inter
vals.
Those who did not go to war or were lucky
enough to get out alive seem anxious to have
another one if their own irresponsible, fear
arousing remarks are to be taken as any
criterion. One wonders what those who re
mained in France would have to say on the
subject.
While the older generation lapses into se
nile dementia and hastens the (lav of combat,
it behooves those of us who grew up since the
chaos of 1914— I>S to keep our heads. To us
war would mean nothing but death and de
struction for we would furnish the raw
material. Frankly, we do not care to serve
humanity by the fertilization of this or of
anv other land.
