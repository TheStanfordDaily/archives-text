While Stanford's powerhouse 19.34 model
IJig Red Machine zoomed up and down the
gridiron in a super exhibition of pigskin tot
ing, some .*>0,(1(1(1 spectators learned something
else about college on Saturday.
In a laudable display of friendliness and
respect for the visiting Huskies, the Indian
rooting section barked out a Washington yell
directed by the acrobatic visiting cheer leader
from the northern state. Later, the entire
eastern side of the stadium weaved rhythmi
cally back and forth as the same individual
had some six or eiglil thousand fans scream
ing a "spell Washington."
lint talk in the press box and on the west
ern half of the Stanford stadium was of
greater interest to the Farm. You know it
there's no use repeating it. .But they tell us
that the fellow who is making yell leading
for the history books is one .lames Triolo of
Alameda, the guy who says Asta the Turtle
and Km ma the Owl would make anv team win.
