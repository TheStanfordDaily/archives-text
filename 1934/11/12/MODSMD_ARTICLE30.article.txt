### CROMPTON BANGS, Jr 
TIIE ELECTIONS: LOOKING BACK

The Democrats are in almost everywhere; the Re
publicans are out almost everywhere, and President
Roosevelt seems to be more popular than ever. Over
whelmed by the 1932 landslide, the G.O.P. was almost
pushed out of the country by last week's elections.
These seem to be the results. Just what do they mean?
For the first time in generations, the administration
party has more than a two-thirds majority In both
houses of Congress. But this is likely to prove more of
a burden than a help to the President.
The apparent solidity of the Democrats actually
conceals a wide variety of rifts in the party.
There are conservative and radical Democrats;
economizing atul spending Democrats; pro and
anti-Legion Democrats. To a lesser extent the
same divisions exist among the Republicans. So
the alignments in the next Congress are likely to
be along these rather than party lines.
All of which means that F.R. can count on big ma
jorities for most of his measure, especially where money
is to be spent for the "voters back home," for now
more than ever a Congressman's chance of getting
re-elected are measured in dollars and cents. The
trouble is that a whale of a majority will plump
squarely for the immediate payment of the bonus,
probably a large enough one to over-ride F.R.'s veto.
How well the President can meet this, test will deter
mine his leadership over Congress.
Now more than ever the initiative rests squarely
with Mr. Roosevelt. With the strongest critics of the
New Deal gone, the President will have to be his own
severest critic.
Realizing that with the accession of this tremen
dous power comes full responsibility for its use, he is
likely to proceed cautiously on the road to recovery.
He will be blamed for anything that goes wrong; he
knows it and realizes more and more that he is the
only co-ordinating force in the Federal government.
It might not be too much to say that Mr. Roosevelt
comes very near to being THE government.
The Republicans now find themselves at the cross
roads. With even Pennsylvania going Democratic they
admit that their party is at its all time low. But
they are hopelessly divided on what to do about it.
One group led by Mr. Fletcher (the party chair
man) believes the party must sit back and wait for
the inevitable reaction to the Democratic policies—if
it doesn't fall apart in the meantime. Other G.O.P.
leaders think only the quick liberalizing of the party's
ideals and the welcoming of anti-Roosevelt Democrats
will save it from ruin.
This is what is likely to happen. Mr. Fletcher
says the New Deal is taking money from the thrifty
to keep the improvident. In this case the thrifty
are likely to become Republicans and the im
provident Democrats. Then the parties would be
realigned on economic principles which would be
a whole lot more sensible than the present mess
wilh several shades of Democrats and several
more shades of Republicans. What is more likely,
though, is a liberal Democratic party and a con
servative Republican party. We may even see
this in 1936.
At any rate the election proves that warnings of
American Liberty at stake and pot-shots at New Deal
policies are very very ineffective. Today's voters (at
least the majority of them) seem to want a definite
thing—money, relief, public works, bonus, or what
have you?
