Armistice Day, 1934, marks the sixteenth milestone
separating the present from the termination of-a war
which eclipsed both in toll of human life and economic
cost, all struggles which had gone before.
Countless ceremonies attest to the world-wide
observance of Armistice Day. President Frank
lin D. Roosevelt visited the grave of the Unknown
Soldier, and Mrs. Roosevelt attended services at
the tomb of Wood row Wilson in the National
Cathedral. Frank N. Belgrano, Jr., newly-elected
American Legion Commander, delivered an ad
dress before a vast throng assembled at Arlington
Cemetery.
In Paris, endless marching columns of blue tramped
past President Albert Debrun and Premier Pierre-
Etienne Flandin to the Arch of Triumph,, where thou
sands gathered to hear the stirring speeches of the
French chiefs. Although fears of grave complications
consequent upon the recent Dolfuss and King Alex
ander assassinations have subsided, France's dread of
a rearmed Germany, and of Realm-leader Hitler's
designs for a great Teuton empire, have created a state
of high nervous tension.
Lieu tenant-Colonel Donald C. Cubbison, pro
fessor of military science and tactics at Stanford,
sees as the growing threat to world peace the ap
proach once more to the old system of offensive and
defensive balances of power. Opposing combina
tions of military strength are today again maneu
vering for hegemony and advantage as in the first
14 years of the twentieth century.
"Two major military systems exist today in the
world," states Lieutenant-Colonel Cubbison. "The
first is that of universal compulsory military service,
wherein all able-bodied men are conscripted for a
period in the army, as in France and Italy.
"Great Britain and America have a different sys
tem. These countries have a highly trained, profes
sional army and navy, auxiliary to 'which is the
citizen militia. The Anglo-Saxon tradition is inimical
to a large standing army."
Effectiveness of American military preparedness in
the event of future hostilities will be conditioned,
Cubbison believes, by the reser
voir of officer-man-power now being created in Amer
ican colleges and universities by the Reserve Officers'
Training Corps. These trained reserves can drill
drafted men adequately in times of emergency.
Dearth of such a nucleus of officers was one reason
that American effectives were not participating in large
numbers in trench warfare in France until fourteen
months had elapsed from the time of American decla
ration of war.
"No persons desire peace more sincerely than
that the American army or navy personnel,'' states
Professor Cubbison. 'and nothing is more re
moved from the aims of R.0.T.C.-training than to
foster a purely militaristic spirit."
For the fiscal year ending June .'5O, 1930, the amount
appropriated for R.O.T.C. work was less than $3,250,000,
for some 114,364 American students, which represents
an average year.
Today we look backward sixteen years to the
momentous occasion which ended the war* But World
War memories swiftly fade in the oubliette of time,
crises develop almost overnight, and who knows what
the chronicler of the thirty-second anniversary of the
signing of the Armistice will write?

CAMERON CUBBISON

Armistice Day, 1934, marks the sixteenth milestone
separating the present from the termination of-a war
which eclipsed both in toll of human life and economic
cost, all struggles which had gone before.
Countless ceremonies attest to the world-wide
observance of Armistice Day. President Frank
lin D. Roosevelt visited the grave of the Unknown
Soldier, and Mrs. Roosevelt attended services at
the tomb of Wood row Wilson in the National
Cathedral. Frank N. Belgrano, Jr., newly-elected
American Legion Commander, delivered an ad
dress before a vast throng assembled at Arlington
Cemetery.
In Paris, endless marching columns of blue tramped
past President Albert Debrun and Premier Pierre-
Etienne Flandin to the Arch of Triumph,, where thou
sands gathered to hear the stirring speeches of the
French chiefs. Although fears of grave complications
consequent upon the recent Dolfuss and King Alex
ander assassinations have subsided, France's dread of
a rearmed Germany, and of Realm-leader Hitler's
designs for a great Teuton empire, have created a state
of high nervous tension.
Lieu tenant-Colonel Donald C. Cubbison, pro
fessor of military science and tactics at Stanford,
sees as the growing threat to world peace the ap
proach once more to the old system of offensive and
defensive balances of power. Opposing combina
tions of military strength are today again maneu
vering for hegemony and advantage as in the first
14 years of the twentieth century.
"Two major military systems exist today in the
world," states Lieutenant-Colonel Cubbison. "The
first is that of universal compulsory military service,
wherein all able-bodied men are conscripted for a
period in the army, as in France and Italy.
"Great Britain and America have a different sys
tem. These countries have a highly trained, profes
sional army and navy, auxiliary to 'which is the
citizen militia. The Anglo-Saxon tradition is inimical
to a large standing army."
Effectiveness of American military preparedness in
the event of future hostilities will be conditioned,
Cubbison believes, by the reser
voir of officer-man-power now being created in Amer
ican colleges and universities by the Reserve Officers'
Training Corps. These trained reserves can drill
drafted men adequately in times of emergency.
Dearth of such a nucleus of officers was one reason
that American effectives were not participating in large
numbers in trench warfare in France until fourteen
months had elapsed from the time of American decla
ration of war.
"No persons desire peace more sincerely than
that the American army or navy personnel,'' states
Professor Cubbison. 'and nothing is more re
moved from the aims of R.0.T.C.-training than to
foster a purely militaristic spirit."
For the fiscal year ending June .'5O, 1930, the amount
appropriated for R.O.T.C. work was less than $3,250,000,
for some 114,364 American students, which represents
an average year.
Today we look backward sixteen years to the
momentous occasion which ended the war* But World
War memories swiftly fade in the oubliette of time,
crises develop almost overnight, and who knows what
the chronicler of the thirty-second anniversary of the
signing of the Armistice will write?
