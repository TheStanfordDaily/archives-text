THOU SHALT NOT?
This country presents the strange
paradox of having more laws and
more lawlessness than most other
nations. Sociologists (not to be con
fused with Socialists) will tell you
that the paradox is not so strange.
For when a great heterogeneity of 1
races is mixed with &n equal hetero
geneity of laws, codes, statutes, and 1
Emily Posts, stirred round with a ,
dash of "frontier spirit," and sea-,
soned with touches of "expanding
economy"—lawlessness is to be ex
pected.

While one cannot be sanguine \
over the prospect of Dillinger lead- j
ing the law's forces a merry chase
over a half-dozen states, and Insull 1
calmly thumbing his nose at the
whole nation from a Grecian hide
away, one wonders if rigid obe- i
dience to law is the greatest of civic '
virtues.

Laws are made for everyone: for 1
the ditch-digger and the college!
professor, for the poor man and for
Midas. In its sweeping generality, <
the law draws but two major classes
of distinction: between adults and
minors, between sane and insane. ,
For minors, there is leniency; -for
the insane there are asylums.
But despite legal equality, ditch
digger and professor, poor and rich i
do not, and cannot be expected to
act alike under the law.
For the very rich, everyone rec- i
ognizes that respectability lies in
conduct that escapes the clutches,
of the law. Jean Valjean spent a
life of horror for stealing a loaf j
bread. The sharper betrays confi
dences—and is a model citizen. All
that is accepted. For poor and for
rich there is a double standard.

Likewise, must one expect the
stupid and the intelligent, the ig- j
norant and the educated to conform j
to the same requirements? Though
the law and social regulations may '
stinke indiscriminately, for the in- j
telligent and the educated to ''con- J
form" to law and society as the
mass is supposed to do, is to raise
doubts as to the worth of "intelli
gence and education." While blan
ket disobedience to law or to social
regulations cannot be condoned,
blanket obedience seems just as
stupid. In one case there results i
anarchy, in the other there results,
the sheep instinct and boredom.
If there can be such a thing as
"enlightened lawlessness," it must be j
a virtue —just as "enlightened self- j
interest" is a virtue when it actually '
does exist. The two are very closely
related.

The "intelligent - * person who halts |
his car at a boulevard stop at 3'
o'clock in the morning simply be- |
cause it is the law, is not a good but
a stupid citizen. There are too
many such.
—Dave Mellinkoff.
