At California and Menlo Theatres
The historical importance of
Grace Moore's picture warrants its
second consideration. Here music—
the finest music—is successfully
brought to the screen for the first

time. This is a
triumph for its
director, Victor
Shertzinger, who j
introduces each
piece - naturally.
When a group |
sings, there is
reason for its

congregation and singing; if an or
chestra plays, it is because adjacent
musicians are inspired to assist.
Too, he occasions spectator antici
pation, an invaluable photoplay
quality, by limiting the duration oi'
the enchanting musical numbers.
He conceals the obviousness of a
I plot basically similar to all backstage
stories, and he succeeds in animat
-1 ing Miss Moore, whose acting is
above reproach. Of course he is ably
assisted by that very strange, ur
bane Italian, possessed oi' a subtle '
and most unusual technique, Tullio
i Carminati. —Lowe.
