# "READY FOR LOVE"

Also at the Varsity
A very, very light farce-comedy
starring Richard Arlen, Ida Lupino,
and Marjorie Rambeau. It involves j
the escapades of the flighty daugh- i
ter of a popular torch-singer, when

she (the daugh- 1
ter) arrives in a |
small town and
is mistaken for j
the ex-flame of
the community's
leading citizen.
Love and much
publicity come;

to her via the editor of the local
newspaper. The final climax, I
achieved by flashing printed head- I
lines on the screen, is completely 1
and absolutely absurd. Nevertheless,
there are some clever lines and a !
few funny scene situations.
