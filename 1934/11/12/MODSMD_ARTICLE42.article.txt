Berkeley, 159 to 0.
The size of the score is no indica
tion of the relative strength of the
two teams. Twenty-six of the Cub
points were scored in the last 16
minutes of the gams, when the
babes were fighting to overcome the
early Bear lead. It was clearly to be
seen that there is no six touch
down difference between the two
clubs.
Fumble Gives Jolt
The Indian babes were set back
on (he first series of plays by a
fumble recovered by California. That
fumble was a sudden and decisive
joll to the young Cards, and they
could not get going after that. They
played Ihe remainder of Ihe game
minus their usual tire and with the
mental attitude of the losing, not the
winning team, but working till the
final gun.
Led by Ham Poole, crashing 215-
pound fullback, the Cubs scored on
the first play of the second quarter
with Poole's short buck. The score
b llowed a 55-yard drive, with two
pretty passes by half Jack Howard,
ami five runs by Poole that bowled
over tacklers right and left. Ned
Sparks, Bear end, missed his first
conversion in several games.
Hcrwig Intercepts
Shortly, afterward. Bob Herwig,
Cub captain and center, intercepted
a Paulman pass on the Card 46.
Howard proceeded to carry the ball
over in nine plays, helped along by I
some potent blocking by John Meek,
and Perry Thomas. Charley Wheeler,;
Piedmont guard, converted. That:
was all for the first half.
Howard's work engineered the |
third touchdown late in the third!
quarter. Starting from his own 46,
ho passed and tore his way to the j
goal. He found large holes in the
line to dart through and ragged I
Card tacklers in the secondary.
Passes Bring Scores
Three more scores came as the j
result of passes, two tossed by Stan- I
ford and one by Cal. Perry Thomas i
intercepted the first one, John Meek
caught Solinsky's for a long gain on j
the'second,' and Gilbert intercepted
Indian Glenn Hamilton's toss for the
last score.
The passes of Bill Paulman, great'
Card full, were just about as good as
ever, but Clint Evans' boys had been
working up a defense for weeks, and
were always there where the ball I
was thrown. Paulman's kicks were j
long as usual, and staved off Bear ■
scores all through the game.
Jay Holdridge, Bernie Layer, and !
Nellie Heath, backed up by Paul- j
man, played great games in the In- :
dian line, stopping Cub smashes |
time and again. The big Cal line i
and powerful, fast backs like Poole, !
Howard, and Cornell were at last I
able to break the Stanford winning !
streak.
