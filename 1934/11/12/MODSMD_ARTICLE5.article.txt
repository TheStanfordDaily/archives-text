# Dippy Defeats Chappies By 6-6 Score

### Tinkle Molehill 
(Who Loved and Lost)
The Stanford Daily Stiffs over- j
whelmed, smothered, whipped, i
slaughtered, slew, quartered, strung,
and also beat the Chappie Staff in j
the Big Game Saturday by the j
epochal score of 6-6.
While thousands leered and low- j
ered and many blondes and bru- J
nettes (and a few Stanford women) J
grinned down at the two teams j
.locked in a bittle struggcr, the Daily
Stiffs won the perpetual, everlasting, j
and almighty Milpitas Honor Award
Atrophy.
Immediately after the final touch- !
down had been touched, and the vic
tory had been assured, I received a j
bid from Joe Whops, 180 pounds,
South Pasadena, for the Daily team
to play in the Rose Bose Game on j
January 1. The price will be $2.50
per couple, including drunks. This I
establishes beyond a Chouteau of a |
doubt that we won the game.
It was not only a great moral vie- j
tory but also a great intra-moral
victory. My boys all played end-s- i
up football, and I wish to say at this ]
time that I'm proud of every Moth
er's son of them, and all others not 1
listed.
Honorable mention goes to many !
stalwarts who equipped the Daily I
Stiff with their impressive Block
"S" sweaters, a plug-ugly, and bi- |
cycles. Sweaters worn were those !
belonging to Tom Williams, '97; Joe j
Urban, '16; the late Everett W. Smith, i
'99; Longueville Price, '13; and W. |
A. Green, '16. The plug-ugly .was j
furnished by Percy MacDowell, '02, j
and the old-time bicycles belonged j
to A1 Roth and Smith's Sport Shop.
