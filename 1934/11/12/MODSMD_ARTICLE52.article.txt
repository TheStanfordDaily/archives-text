### M. Jack Newman 
Lawson Little may be the number
I one golfer of the world but right
j now he is playing a decidedly sec
| ond fiddle to Tom Dwyer, who met
| and decisively defeated the interna
tional champion Friday afternoon. I
The match was for the title of Stan- |
ford's number one golfer.
Starting at the long end of five to j
i one odds at the first tee, Dwyer dis- I
! posed of Little by winning seven j
j out of thirteen holes that j
| played.

I just what type of golf is played at j
; Stanford. Any place where the Brit- j
I ish and American Amateur cham- ;
pion can be defeated in his first de- i
i fense of his seeded team position has :
1 golfers. It must be remembered, '
i too, that Dwyer has been beaten by j
| others on the team.
j Little's golf was good, but it was I
| apparent that he was not quite in j
j the form that won two major cham- ,
! pionships for him. The first two !
[ holes that Dwyer won were more or :
[ less unearned, but from that time |
i on it was sheer superiority that won j
for him.
First Hole Halved
The match started with the two J
i players halving the first hole. Little !
! made a spectacular shot out of the
: trap on the right of the green to
| save himself from a loss. The second
| hole was likewise halved with pars.
The third hole was also even. On
; the fourth Dwyer hit a drive which !
! faded toward the fence but stayed !
j in bounds, but very near the fence.
Little hit two powerful pokes, but j
. both faded too much and went, out
•of bounds. He conceded the hole to |
i Dwyer. Five was the minimum i
j score he could have made.
On the fifth hole, Dwyer was j
I straight down the center on the j
! apron of the green in two shots, j
Little was wide to the right under- I
! neath a tree. Little's approach pitch [
; was short and caught the tall grass j
above the right trap. He pitched on I
and took two putts. Dwyer pitched
| short and holed out in two for the
second win. •
Dwyer Makes Birdie
The sixth hole was the start of j
Dwyer's birdie eagle barrage under 1
i which Little floundered. Both drives '
! were down the center. Little was
| about 20 yards in front of Dwyer |
; with a much better angle to the ;
green. Dwyer shot first, hitting the '
I green and rolling about 15 feet to \
] the side of the pin. Little went over 1
| the green. He approached to the pin,
1 but Dwyer holed out his birdie.
By far the best hole from the
spectators' angle was the seventh. ;
Little hit a screaming drive over the
dog leg of the hole. Dwyer played it j
in the orthodox manner, straight j
down the fairway to the turn. He
; shot to the green on his second with :
about a 250-yard brassie. Little |
took an iron to get on in two. Dwyer
then stepped up and sank his putt
for an eagle three. Little, closer to
the hole, putted for his and missed.
Dwyer four up.
Both were on the eighth in one. i
j Little missed his approach putt by j
[ sub-par hole in series. Little won !
the ninth hole for his only win in j
the round. It took a birdie to win. j
They both had bogies on the tenth. I
Dwyer won the eleventh with a;
' birdie. The next two holes he won !
; with pars and the match was over.
Back of the championship match,
Jack Hoerner and Spec Stewart
were battling for the chance to chal- j
lenge the defeated from the number j
j three position. It was an even j
| match, Stewart lost by one hole and ;
! Hoerner challenged Little. The win
j ner of that match when played will
take a crack at Dwyer on the top. j
This tilt, will probably come some I
j time this week.

Dwyer's birdie eagle barrage under 1
i which Little floundered. Both drives '
! were down the center. Little was
| about 20 yards in front of Dwyer |
; with a much better angle to the ;
green. Dwyer shot first, hitting the '
I green and rolling about 15 feet to \
] the side of the pin. Little went over 1
| the green. He approached to the pin,
1 but Dwyer holed out his birdie.
By far the best hole from the
spectators' angle was the seventh. ;
Little hit a screaming drive over the
dog leg of the hole. Dwyer played it j
in the orthodox manner, straight j
down the fairway to the turn. He
; shot to the green on his second with :
about a 250-yard brassie. Little |
took an iron to get on in two. Dwyer
then stepped up and sank his putt
for an eagle three. Little, closer to
the hole, putted for his and missed.
Dwyer four up.
Both were on the eighth in one. i
j Little missed his approach putt by j
[ sub-par hole in series. Little won !
the ninth hole for his only win in j
the round. It took a birdie to win. j
They both had bogies on the tenth. I
Dwyer won the eleventh with a;
' birdie. The next two holes he won !
; with pars and the match was over.
Back of the championship match,
Jack Hoerner and Spec Stewart
were battling for the chance to chal- j
lenge the defeated from the number j
j three position. It was an even j
| match, Stewart lost by one hole and ;
! Hoerner challenged Little. The win
j ner of that match when played will
take a crack at Dwyer on the top. j
This tilt, will probably come some I
j time this week.
Lawson Little may be the number
