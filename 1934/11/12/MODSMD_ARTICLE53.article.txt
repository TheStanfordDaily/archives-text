### Phil Duffy 
Poor Bill! The Golden Bears of
j California rambled to their first
j football victory over old S.C. since
1928, and their coach, Navy Bill In
' gram, the most harassed man on
\ the Pacific Coast today, wasn't even
: there to glory in the 7-2 win.
It was "Workhorse" Arleigh Wil
; liams playing his last game against
' Troy, who turned the tide of battle
| last Saturday, galloping 30 yards to
j a touchdown early in the first quar
â–  ler. With seven points to the good
the Cal men fell back on their usual
| defensive type of game and by sheer
j grit and determination turned back
| three Trojan thrusts.
