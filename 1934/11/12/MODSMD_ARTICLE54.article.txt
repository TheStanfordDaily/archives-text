# San Mateo Soccermen Win Over Stanford, 2-1
## 
### 
Stanford played her soccer cau
tiously Saturday, taking no chances
on weakening her team before the
Cal series which opens Big Game
day, and dropped a close game to
San Mateo J.C. 2-1.
Coach Maloney recognized the
Bulldogs as a superior team and did
not point to a victory. He used every
man he took to San Mateo in the
game at one time or another.
In spite of this procedure the
Cards played the best soccer of the
day. The forward line, composed of
Gomez, Row, Forhan, Dibblee, and
Halaby during the first quarter cams
within inches of scoring several
times. But -the good showing of
these men was due principally to the
feeding by the halfback line, where
Captain Waddy White played such
soccer as was near spectacular,
seemingly being able to cover every
man on the field.
