## 
### Gordon Frest 
This undefeated Stanford Varsit?
has nothing on its understudy, ik.
Grays, as far as season's showing
is concerned. Displaying their power
to a highly rated California Rambler
squad, Saturday, the Grays pounded
to a 13-7 victory to end their sea
son undefeated and untied. It was
the Stanford reserve - California re
serve battle, the only game played
by the Graymen this year.
Johnny Campbell and Joe Vigna
were the centers of the Cardinal
offense. Campbell, ineligible for
varsity competition this season, dis
played his remarkable passing abil
ity and Vigna made good gains on
his runs.
In the second quarter the Grays
started a drive from midfiold which
culminated in a pass, Campbell tc
Vigna for the score. Later in the
quarter the local reserves again
drove to the Rambler goal, Ray
Lewis sliding over from the one
yard line for the tally. Lewis' con
version was good.
Doug Mc√üae was responsible for
the California score when he finally
cracked through the powerful for
ward wall of the Stanford reserves
to cross the goal from the one-yard
stripe.
Four different times did the Gray
line, which averages 195 pounds,
only two pounds lighter than the
varsity, hold the onslaught of the
Ramblers after they had crossed the
five-yard marker.
"All our boys played a good
game," declared Coach Murray Cud
deback last night.
