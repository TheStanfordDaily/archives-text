# Troup To Present Comedy at Matinee
## "Lear" Will Be Featured On Evening Program 
### Mary Mayer 
Selected for the matinee perform
ance of the William Thornton com
pany at the University on Wednes
day afternoon is "The Taming of
the Shrew."
Sponsored by the English Club,
the play will commence at 2:15 in
the afternoon. In the evening, the
more serious selection, "King Lear,"
will be presented.
The cast for "The Taming of
the Shrew" includes Robert Brauns
and Frances Slanina, former
Stanford students. Miss Slanina
appears as a hostess, and Brajuns
takes the part of Biondello, a
servant.
Not only Miss Slanina and Brauns,
but the entire cast are young; and
their youthful attitude is apparent
in their approach to "The Taming of
the Shrew." They make of it a
modern farce, introducing slap
stick. Their enthusiasm produces a
performance which could not pos
sibly be called dull.
Emphasis is decidedly upon com
edy, as Thornton and his company
romp through this lighter one of
Shakespeare's plays. They tui'n it
into a masquerade, and the audience
has a good time.
Although interpreted as comedy
by the Thornton troupe, "The
Taming of the Shrew" is a story
possessing a versatile character. It
can as readily be called tragedy.
Masefield has called it the tragedy
of a woman's "fine, free, careless
spirit dragged down ... to submis
sive wifely falsehood by a boor
who cares only for his own will, her
flesh, and her money."
Although the players strike out
in defiance of staid tradition in
their presentation of the play,
they capture the time and spirit of
the Paduan setting. Settings and
costumes are simple and good in
effect. Colors are harmoniously
combined. The ensemble is in
nocent of fussiness.
Friendliness is in the attitude of
the supporting cast toward Kather
ine and Petruchio. Thornton is a
dashing extrovei*:, and Janet Thom
as catches the spi-it of high comedy
in her Katherine.
Tickets for this performance as
well as for "King Lenr," are on sale
at the Stanford boorstore and at
Keeble's in Palo Alto.
