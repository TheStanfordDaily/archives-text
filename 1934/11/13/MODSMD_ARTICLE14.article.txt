# TERMAN LAUDS SUPERIOR CHILD
## Psychologist Bases Study On Living Subjects 
### 
'Intellectual precocity is a favor
able rather than an unfavorable
omen," said Lewis M. Terman dur
ing the Stanford broadcast over ra
dio station KGO at 8 o'clock last
night.
The majority of the evidence to
date in Professor Terman's most re
cent experiment in psychology in
dicates that superior children be
come superior adults, with the nat
ural exception of a few. This is con
trary to the widespread opinion that
the gifted child turns out badly, be
coming a psycopath or an eccentric.
Experiment Lengthy
"What usually happens to these
exceptional cases," said Frofessor
Terman, "is that the child usually
develops attitudes or qualities of
personality which nullify the ad
vantages of superior intelligence."
Professor Terman's conclusions
are based on biographical data of
living boys and girls whom he has
seen and tested and examined
throughout a period of 14 years.
When he selected a thousand of the
brightest children that he could find
in the schools of California, they
ranged in age from three to 13
years. Several Stanford students are
included in this group whose present
ages range from 17 to 32 years.
Enter Professions
Professor Terman pointed out that
more than half of the boys and a
large proportion of the girls have
entered or are preparing to enter
one of the professions—law, medi
cine, engineering, or teaching—and
that several are dedicating their
lives to scientific research."
Many of the girls get married on
completing their college course, and
they usually selcet husbands who are
also blessed with brains.
