# Hatfield Is Remembered As Aloof Farm Student
## 
### JOHN McClelland 
Swept, into the lieutenant gover
nor's office by the election lust week
was one of Stanford's best known
alumni, George J. Hatfield, '11, re
membered by those who knew him
in college as one of the finest law
students of the University and also
one of the most aloof persons from
student affairs.
No records of the University show
that Hatfield ever made a name for
himself on the Farm other than in
scholarship. For three years he
lived in 120 Encina and attended
strictly to the business of his
classes.
Faculty members of the law school
remember the present lieutenant
governor as a brilliant student, a
young man who had ideas of his
own and who was somewhat intol
. erant of the ideas of others. It seems
that H Micld impressed some as even
I beinj, liai d-boiled in his undergrad
uate d:iy: He was distinctly an in
j dividuali? lic sort of person who
| tu Id .iti ii ' y to his own principles.

Quad records show that Hatfield
was only a third year student when
he received his first degree, an A.B.
in Pre-legal. In the yearbook he is
pictured as a serious looking young
man with a very high forehead and
wearing a bow tie. In his freshman
year he completed 48 units and by
the end of his third year had 112
units to his credit.
Hatfield's record out of college
shows him to be just as active as
he was inactive while going to
school. After getting his A.M. and
J.D. degrees in 1912 and 1913 he
joined a law firm in San Francisco.
A short time later he hung out his
own shingle with two other Stanford
grads.
After serving in the war, Hatfield
was active in organizing Amefican
Legion posts and was appointed to
the State Veterans Welfare Board.
In 1925 President Coolidge appointed
him United States attorney for
Northern California, a post which
he held until 1932.
