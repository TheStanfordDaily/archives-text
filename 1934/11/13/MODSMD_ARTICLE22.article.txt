# Conference Reconsiders Late Leaves
## Question To Be Discussed At Meet Tonight 
### 
After a week of campus - wide
discussion, Women's Conference will
reconsider the late leave revision
question at its meeting this after
noon.
During the past week individual
Conference members have contacted
a large number of women, in order
to get as many views of the question
as possible. Open forums were held
in Lagunita on Tuesday and in the
Union on Friday. At house meetings
in all women's living groups last
night the problem was discussed
from all angles.
Last night Conference President
Marion Storey„ said: "Tomorrow's
Conference is again to consider the
minor revision of the late leave sys
tem us it now stands. The opinions
expressed during the past week to
the presidents by members of their
living groups will be presented to
the whole of Conference. Then there
will be a complete reconsideration
of all the factors involved in this re
vision. A vote will be taken when it
is felt that the whole picture of the
case has been completed—either at
the end of today's meeting or next
week."
The change under discussion is
that any overnight leave be consid
ered as one, of the 2:3o's for the
week. Freshmen are allowed one
week-end 2:30 every week; five
"floating" 2:3o's to be used either as
week-end or as midweeks; and five
"floating" midweek 12 o'clocks.
Women who have a C average or
above and are not freshmen receive
two 2:3o's per week, to be used either
in the midweek or on the week-end.
Thy are also allowed one mid-week
12 o'clock each week, and three
"floating" 2:3o's. Under the revision
the number of 2:30 "floaters" will be
increased to five instead of three.
