# Relief Drive Nets Results

### 
Initial results of the student drive
for Red Cross membership are defi
nitely encouraging, according to co-
Chairmen Bob Church and Will Eis
ner, who are directing the cam
paign. Heads of living groups and
their assistants report that students
are showing an even greater spirit
of co-operation than they have
shown in past years, although the
drive, which is conducted on the
campus each year, has always re
ceived enthusiastic student suppor f .
Charlotte Gibner, Helen Grover,
Bill Waltman and Rupert Phrome,
who are directing work in the living j
groups, find that proceeds from yes- i
terday's drive are notably greater |
lhan those taken in on the first day I
of last year's drive.
Representatives in living units are !
asked to turn each day's proceeds
in to the A.S.S.U. office between 1
and 1:30 o'clock.
Students are urged to take out
memberships immediately as Ihe!
drive ends on Friday of this week.
The organization also wishes to re
peat that it is not necessary for
students to take out an individual
membership but that they may par- i
ticipate by contributing any amount
in conjunction with other members
of their living units.
Additional students appointed to
canvass their living units are the
following: Bruce Rutherford, Delta
Chi; Bill Howell, Delta Kappa Ep
silon; Norman Adams, Phi Sigma
Kappa; Lloyd Brook, Signia Alph.\
Epsilon; Bob Tripp, Theta Delta Chi.
