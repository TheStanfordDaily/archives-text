# ONE DAY REST TEAM'S REWARD FOR HUSKY WIN
## No Turnout Held Yesterday As Thornhill Gives Squad Vacation WINGED 'O' GAME NEXT Tiny Plans for Scrimmage This Afternoon 
### 
To the victor goes the spoils.
And Tiny Thornhill spoiled his
victorious Stanford Indian football
team yesterday by rewarding them
with a rest after their smashing win
over the Washington Huskies.
Stanford will play the Olympic
Club Saturday, but the folks on the
Farm aren't taking the Clubmen at
all seriously.
So the Cardinals will hold only
four of practice for the
Winged "O" contest, and it is prob
able they will scrimmage consider
ably for the next two days. They
have not held any body contact with
one another since before the U.C.LA.
game. "Their condition was good
enough," Thornhill indicated.
Stanford probably will not scrim
mage after the Olympic Club tilt
either, so heavy preparations for
California will be taken care of to
day and tomorrow.
All of the Indians except the
running guards survived the Wash
ington game, which almost definitely
eliminated the Huskies from the
Coast Conference and Hose Bowl
races, without injury. In that left
guard post, however, Bob Black
joined Woody Adams in the list of
sprained ankle victims.
Both Black and Adams will be
back for guard work for the Big
Game, but there is a strong possi
bility that Thornhill will confine
them to the sidelines during the
Olympic Club fray and give the
starting call to Tom Callaghan, Sac
ramento Junior College transfer,
who has played but a few minutes
during the entire season to date.
Other injuries resulting from the
Washington game were temporary
blows, suffered by Keith Topping,
Wes Muller, and Bobby Grayson,
but all three were fresh yesterday
and will be in uniform today.
