# For the Supreme Court: The Case of Tom Mooney
## 
### 
An eighteen-year-old legal battle is appar
ently approaching a long-awailed termina
tion with the news thai Tom Mooney, Cali
fornia's most famous prisoner, is on the verge
of having his day in the United States Su
preme Court. Of course there is nothing defi
nite yet; the court has merely indicated ils
intention of reviewing the situation unless
California can show good cause why it should
not.
The slate has forty days in which to file
ils cause; at the end of this lime the court
may proceed with the review or refuse it. The
Moonev defense will contend that he was
deprived of a fair trial in violation of the
fourteenth amendment to the Constitution and
will cite evidence of perjured testimony in
support of this contention.
Whether the court will hold that Mooney
was deprived of a fair trial is the problem
that hangs wavering in the balance. The
decision depends on the judges; their preju
dices, their heredity, background, schooling,
logic; the particular molecular combination
within their brain cells at the precise moment
of decision. The best one can say is that Moo
ney lias a case, which is another way of saving
that he has a fifty-fifty chance.
Should the court hold that his constitu
tional rights were violated, he has more bar
riers to clear. The whole story must be re
opened in the state courts and all the jum
bled mass of evidence mulled over again. A
lot of water is due to How under the bridge
before Mooney ever becomes a free man, if
he becomes a free man at all.
Should he someday regain his good name
and freedom we will have to regard with dis
gust I tie lumbering wheels of justice that
turned against him these many years; and
should the final edict be in his disfavor we will
harbor a like disgust for the same justice that
look nearly twenty years to distinguish right
from wrong.
