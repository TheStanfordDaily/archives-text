# Objective Bridge Builders

### 
Heeent bridge disputes, which have re
echoed on Iho Stanford campus mildly, lead
to the belief that people are primarily selfish
all of the time, and extremely dogmatic most
of (he time.
A distinguished Stanford scientist, known
throughout the country in the field of geology,
;md awarded international recognition in his
field, made some observations and issued a
statement pointing out certain defects in the
structure foundation for the Golden Gate
bridge.
It is a mere fact that most scientists carry
on their investigations with no material aim
for reward in mind. On the other hand, there
is a thrill of accomplishment, and the feeling
of having rendered some service to fellow
men, which is responsible for some of sci
ence's most remarkable achievements.
Willi this fact in mind, it is hard to under
stand the attitude taken by the directors of
the bridge as soon as they received this hit
â€¢ >!' objective criticism. A fellow professor from
the I niversity of California was soon forth
coming with many remarks concerning the
absolute safety of the bridge site. This pre
cipitated a mild flurry of exchanges between
the two scientists. Memarks became more
caustic as the argument grew older, and finally
the two professors appeared before bridge
overseers in an informal investigation.
The pity of the whole episode is that the
testimony, offered in good faith, was not cour
teously received. Mather than being taken in
the light of valuable information, the pro
fessors' appearance before the board resem
bled more or less a cross-examination of mo
tives in investigating bridge foundations.
So it seems that people believe .just what
they iimnf to believe. It is easy to close one's
eyes and ears and take the easy path. Hut for
some future generation, in one instance at
least, this easy road may prove to "have dis
astrous effects.
