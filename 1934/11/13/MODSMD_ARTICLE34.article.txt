# "INS" AND THE "OUTS"
## CALIFORNIA IS SAVED!—WHAT NEXT? 
### CROMPTON BANGS, Jr 
BOSTON, Nov. 11. —Now that Governor Merriam is
safe in Sacramento for four years, and California has
been saved from the ruination of Sinclairism, every
thing should be rosy, but it isn't. And it probably
won't be. Here's the reason why.
Sinclair may be defeated, but his movement is
not. It is quite likely that the result of this elec
tion may be only the start of a class contest,
which he turned from latent unrest into a political
crusade for the governorship. It must be remem
bered that nearly a million people supported him
in the first serious movement against the profit
system in tlie United States.
In spite of all the highly-paid-for propaganda, the
movement is not Communistic, nor Russian; Commun
ists also fought EPIC, though some backed it on the
sly. On the contrary, it was built mainly on the
support of the jobless and the Southern California
immigrants from the Middle West—certainly pure
American. Sinclair gave them hope, so they supported
him. His defeat and Merriam's election will not re
move these basic conditions. Only an abnormally
long visit of prosperity to the state can do this.
So there are many people who feel that Sinclair's
defeat will merely add impetus to his crusade. In the
first place, the questionable camaign waged against
him will add greatly to his persecution complex, and
it may very well be an unfortunate boomerang for the
Republicans a few years hence.
Then his defeat has left him on the outside of
things. Here he has an opportunity to do the destruc
tive job of tearing down the state government. Had he
been elected, the responsibility placed upon him, to
gether with the impossibility of most of EPIC, would
soon have had him stewing in his own juice.
Unfortunately, the laws of California afford Sin
clairites a wonderful opportunity to harass the state
government. There are enough of his followers to
enable Mr. Sinclair to get initiative, referendum, and
recall on anything. He promised he would make use
of these weapons to force Merriam to carry out Imme
diate EPIC. Whether he can or not, the threat will
still be there.
Calling out troops or vigilante raids won't down
EPIC and its followers; its roots have grown too
deep and there arc too many of them. The only
difficulty is "to hold them together. Regardless of
whether Sinclair can do this, there are other fac
tors that can. Federal Relief having established
a political class, California and human nature be
ing what they are, this election may be only the
beginning of a real class war.
In such circumstances it is unfortunate that the
state has no Moses to load it out of the wilderness,
no Roosevelt to lead a middle-of-the-road course. So
unless a miracle happens—and they seldom do at 70
—Merriam can look forward to lots of trouble and a
real battle four years hence.

things. Here he has an opportunity to do the destruc
tive job of tearing down the state government. Had he
been elected, the responsibility placed upon him, to
gether with the impossibility of most of EPIC, would
soon have had him stewing in his own juice.
Unfortunately, the laws of California afford Sin
clairites a wonderful opportunity to harass the state
government. There are enough of his followers to
enable Mr. Sinclair to get initiative, referendum, and
recall on anything. He promised he would make use
of these weapons to force Merriam to carry out Imme
diate EPIC. Whether he can or not, the threat will
still be there.
Calling out troops or vigilante raids won't down
EPIC and its followers; its roots have grown too
deep and there arc too many of them. The only
difficulty is "to hold them together. Regardless of
whether Sinclair can do this, there are other fac
tors that can. Federal Relief having established
a political class, California and human nature be
ing what they are, this election may be only the
beginning of a real class war.
In such circumstances it is unfortunate that the
state has no Moses to load it out of the wilderness,
no Roosevelt to lead a middle-of-the-road course. So
unless a miracle happens—and they seldom do at 70
—Merriam can look forward to lots of trouble and a
real battle four years hence.
BOSTON, Nov. 11. —Now that Governor Merriam is
safe in Sacramento for four years, and California has
been saved from the ruination of Sinclairism, every
thing should be rosy, but it isn't. And it probably
won't be. Here's the reason why.
Sinclair may be defeated, but his movement is
not. It is quite likely that the result of this elec
tion may be only the start of a class contest,
which he turned from latent unrest into a political
crusade for the governorship. It must be remem
bered that nearly a million people supported him
in the first serious movement against the profit
system in tlie United States.
In spite of all the highly-paid-for propaganda, the
movement is not Communistic, nor Russian; Commun
ists also fought EPIC, though some backed it on the
sly. On the contrary, it was built mainly on the
support of the jobless and the Southern California
immigrants from the Middle West—certainly pure
American. Sinclair gave them hope, so they supported
him. His defeat and Merriam's election will not re
move these basic conditions. Only an abnormally
long visit of prosperity to the state can do this.
So there are many people who feel that Sinclair's
defeat will merely add impetus to his crusade. In the
first place, the questionable camaign waged against
him will add greatly to his persecution complex, and
it may very well be an unfortunate boomerang for the
Republicans a few years hence.
Then his defeat has left him on the outside of
things. Here he has an opportunity to do the destruc
tive job of tearing down the state government. Had he
been elected, the responsibility placed upon him, to
gether with the impossibility of most of EPIC, would
soon have had him stewing in his own juice.
