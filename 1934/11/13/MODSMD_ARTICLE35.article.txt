Wiped off the program of last Congress at Roose
velt's request for additional time, unemployment in
surance measures arc still being perfected by a presi
dential commission at Washington. What they will pro
pose no one knows since several have received serious
consideration.
That some action will be taken early in the session
is certain according to William Hopkins, instructor in
economics and citizenship, who follows closely all
labor problems. There will be no proposals for na
tional regulation, he says, but Congress will pass
laws making it possible for the States to carry out
their own legislation.
"Senator Wagner proposed a plan providing for
a 5 per cent federal tax on the payroll of all
industries employing over 100 persons. Industries
were to he relieved of tax insofar as they contrib
ute to a state unemployment fund. That plan was
ready to he passed at the last Congress when it
was killed in advance by the President, who be
lieved it should he part of a more comprehensive
scheme," Hopkins said.
"It is probable that the recommendation off the
commission will be much of the same idea since the
chairman has always advocated a plan where unem
ployment funds were made up by contributions of
employers. It is really not an insurance, it is a re
serve fund."
The Wagner plan is designed to encourage employ
ers to stabilize production and to eliminate unemploy
ment. It is based on ihe assumption that unemploy
ment is not the fault of the employee and therefore he
should be relieved from paying for it.
"This arrangement will not eliminate unemploy
ment due to depression but it would do away a
groat deal with the seasonal peaks and slumps.
Particularly in the canning business, a stabilization
can be effected," the instructor believes.
Another scheme being discussed at Washington
provides for the federal government to loan to the
states sufficient funds to put an unemployment insur
ance plan in action. The government will underwrite
the insurance until it gets under way.
"I don't think anyone ought to be overly pes
simistic or optimistic about a revolutionary move,
since the only way much can be done is through
state action following passing of a bill by Con
gress," Hopkins says.
"Most state legislatures are it) session at the same
time as Congress. Many meet bi-annually. They will
be meeting in January, 1935, and then not again until
1937, which, of course, means that in nrd"r to get
results soon Congress will have to pass its legislation
right at the beginning of the session, and state legisla
tures will have to act quickly before they themselves
adjourn."

since the only way much can be done is through
state action following passing of a bill by Con
gress," Hopkins says.
"Most state legislatures are it) session at the same
time as Congress. Many meet bi-annually. They will
be meeting in January, 1935, and then not again until
1937, which, of course, means that in nrd"r to get
results soon Congress will have to pass its legislation
right at the beginning of the session, and state legisla
tures will have to act quickly before they themselves
adjourn."
Wiped off the program of last Congress at Roose
velt's request for additional time, unemployment in
surance measures arc still being perfected by a presi
dential commission at Washington. What they will pro
pose no one knows since several have received serious
consideration.
That some action will be taken early in the session
is certain according to William Hopkins, instructor in
economics and citizenship, who follows closely all
labor problems. There will be no proposals for na
tional regulation, he says, but Congress will pass
laws making it possible for the States to carry out
their own legislation.
"Senator Wagner proposed a plan providing for
a 5 per cent federal tax on the payroll of all
industries employing over 100 persons. Industries
were to he relieved of tax insofar as they contrib
ute to a state unemployment fund. That plan was
ready to he passed at the last Congress when it
was killed in advance by the President, who be
lieved it should he part of a more comprehensive
scheme," Hopkins said.
"It is probable that the recommendation off the
commission will be much of the same idea since the
chairman has always advocated a plan where unem
ployment funds were made up by contributions of
employers. It is really not an insurance, it is a re
serve fund."
The Wagner plan is designed to encourage employ
ers to stabilize production and to eliminate unemploy
ment. It is based on ihe assumption that unemploy
ment is not the fault of the employee and therefore he
should be relieved from paying for it.
"This arrangement will not eliminate unemploy
ment due to depression but it would do away a
groat deal with the seasonal peaks and slumps.
Particularly in the canning business, a stabilization
can be effected," the instructor believes.
Another scheme being discussed at Washington
provides for the federal government to loan to the
states sufficient funds to put an unemployment insur
ance plan in action. The government will underwrite
the insurance until it gets under way.
"I don't think anyone ought to be overly pes
simistic or optimistic about a revolutionary move,
since the only way much can be done is through
state action following passing of a bill by Con
gress," Hopkins says.
