## CHAPPIES INDIGNANT 
### 
The Stanford Daily
Dear Slurs:
The Chappies are indignant! They
are deeply hurt after their great
game. 6 to 6! Pray tell us how that
score may be interpreted as a Daily
victory. The Chappies won — the
Chappies won—decisively. It was a
great moral victory for the Chapar
ral team —a real testimony tor clean,
upright living.
There can be no doubt in any of
the Chaparral team's minds—at least,
the master mind—of their undisput
able triumph. They slaughtered,
whipped, trounced, and devastated
your willy-nilly bunch. We are
judging the outcome on the new
Dickinson-rating-system. On this

i score, the Chappies won points on
good looks, natty outfits, person
' ahty, correct mouth-was'h, and con
trol of the referee. The Daily lost
I on all counts—in fact, they had no
! trace of royal blood.
.Again the Chappie won! In case
you still harbor illusions as to your
prowess, we will play you an inter
actional game for the journalistic
championship of the nation —we will
write you at 50 spaces. Wait until
the 22nd when our Big Game num
ber burns off the presses—you will
be so ashamed that you will be
afraid to look a typewriter in the
face. Yah; Chappie is victorious.
Yours,
"Monday-mourning-coach"
