# INTERMEDIARY ANSWERS

### 
The Editor, Sir:
As "disinterested" intermediary, I
should like to submit a dissenting
opihion (from that of my three
friends) in regard to the comments
on their original letter, which you
so kindly published. I, personally,
was pleased—l might even say over
joyed — at the wholehearted, if at
times derogatory, response, which

i that epistle evoked.
I hope and trust that this letter
;-nd the concurrent one from the
"three gentlemen" will conclude the
I frivolous banter, which they so in
! nocently began, and that the three
! young men and the "brunette in
! white" will be allowed to go their
romantic way in peace.
j Very sincerely yours,
i "Disinterested Intermediary"
