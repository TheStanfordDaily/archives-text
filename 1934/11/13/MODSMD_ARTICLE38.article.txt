The Editor, Sir:
We, the original "three gentle
man" (?), would like to express
our appreciation for the good of
fices of your newspaper in enabling
uii to contact the "brunette in
white." We, who still believe in
the existence of romance "on the
farm," were rather surprised at the
antagonistic attitude of our Se
quoia "friends!"
A young lady, who claims to be
the "brunette," has written to us,

and we have communicated to her
via telephone. If mutual dissatis
faction is not aroused upon seeing
each other again, we hope to become
a "foursome."
Gratefully yours,
"Three Gentlemen"
P.S.: For those inquisitive individ
uals, who wish to spend some time
thumbing through the "Bawlout,"
we append our initials.
