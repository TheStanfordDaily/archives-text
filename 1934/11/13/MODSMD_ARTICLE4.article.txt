## 
### 
"A perfect 44, madom," says the
Venerable Cuckoo, tucking away his

"It is rather large, but then, it

"For my own brudder it gives no
no less," said the Cuckoo. "It's the
first time in years the Chaparral has
had 44 pages for Big Game Issue,
and the Big Game Issue is always
the biggest of the year.
