"THE GAY DIVORCEE"
At the Stanford Theatre
"The Gay Divorcee" is one of
the most polished pieces of enter
tainment to come from Hollywood
in some months. It is not a great
picture, but it is a very amusing

and satisfying
one. Clever lines,
good music,
beautiful danc
ing, plenty of
comedy —it has
all the essen
tials of a good
show. Its only

fault is the usual RKO tendency to
go overboard on the footage of the
'featured musical number —in this
case, "The Continental." The most
.beautiful number was Cole Porter's
"Night and Day" (the only num
ber retained from the original stage
play), in which Max Steiner outdid
himself on the musical arrangement,
and Fred Astaire and . Ginger Rog
ers gave some of the loveliest danc
ing ever to appear on the screen.
Edward Everett Horlon and Alice
Brady furnish much of the comedy
in the picture. Special mention
should go to two minor characters:.
Eric Rhodes as "Tonetti," the pro
fessional tenor-singing co-respond
ent, and Eric Blore, as a very Eng
lish waiter. —Be±nheim.
