AHONEN-TO-GRAYSON
GOOD COMBINATION
Stanford has found a new scor
ing combination. But —too bad —it
can't be used again this year. It is
the Ahonen to Grayson pass, which
scored twice for the Indians against
Washington Saturday. There is a
slight technicality, however; Aho
nen is registered in the University
of Washington.
Grayson is an All-American.
There had been some mention of
it all along, but there is little or
110 doubt now. He did every
thing in the Indian triumph over
Washington, from completely
messing up the Husky passing
attack to giving as classy a block
ing demonstration as he has ever
staged.
Moscrip, Stanford's other All-
American, was less spectacular than
Grayson, but ha left no doubt in
the minds of Washington players,
particularly, that he has every bit as
much claim to the position as has
Grayson.
MOSCRIP AMONG
HEAVY SCORERS
Thirty points is a lot to make
against major competition on the
gridiron, but when they are made
without a single touchdown in
cluded, and when they are made by i
a lineman, that is something. Mos
crip, an end, has scored that many
digits in his eight games this year j
and is among the first five in Pa
cific Coast scoring.
Moscrip has made five good field
goals and fifteen conversion points, l
and is the only lineman in the con
lerence who has crashed into the
first dozen scorers.
BIG GAME IS
ALL THAT'S LEFT
Stanford is definitely in the Rose j
Bowl again this year—if she beats
California. Sounds easy, doesn't it?
But the Big Game is always the
Big Game, and that means football
players and teams are not quite
themselves. Not only that, but we
kind of half believe some of the j
publicity coming out of Berkeley |
early this year about the Bears j
having a lot of material. Is it too |
fantastic to assume that this mate- j
rial might click some time before i
the season is over?
In spite of what California can do, j
Stanford will win if the Indians are ;
up to the game put up a week from i
Saturday.
But the Bears, at least one of |
them, really showed something in
taking just one more bite out of i
the glory that was old Troy. Ar
leigh Williams, from all accounts, |
is (me of the better ball packers ,
011 the Coast.
Maybe we've been wasting our j
sympathy on California. Poor How- j
ard Jones! —Browne, j
