slaught of a powerful and versatile
Stanford eleven by a humiliating
24-0 score.
Syracuse, Colgate Win
Two undefeated teams succumbed
to two eastern teams hailing from
New York territory in intersectional
battles. Michigan State from the
Midwest was smothered 10-0 by
Syracuse, who made it their sixth
straight win with only seven points
against them. Tulane from the South
suffered a blight to their undefeated
record when they fell 20-6 before a
bewildering Colgate attack that fea
tured series of lateral passes be
tween all eleven members of Andy
Kerr's team.
Three of the 11 unconquered teams
remain so, only by the margin of a
few points that favored them last
Saturday. Navy with all the statis
tics against them but the linal score
won their seventh straight victory by
defeating Notre Dame 10-6. Rice
met tough opposition from Arkansas,
winning 7-0 as a result of a clever
pass formation.

long as his Louisiana State eleven
eked out a 6-0 victory over George
Washington University, who out
played the southerners in every de
partment of the game. Alabama, the
third team from the South, with an
undefeated season swamped Clem
son, 40-0.
Temple Wins Easily

choices for Rose Bowl consideration,

of football, Glenn Scobey Warner,

Temple season record remains in
tact with only a 6-6 tie with In
diana marring it.
