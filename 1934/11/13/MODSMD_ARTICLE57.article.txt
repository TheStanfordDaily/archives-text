# WATER POLOISTS FACE S.F. TEAM
## 
### 
A real toss-up game will be in
store for water polo fans when Stan
ford and the Olympic Club tangle
in Encina pool at 1 o'clock Satur
day afternoon. The individual bi-il
liance of the clubmen, as well as
season records, makes the outcome
almost impossible to predict.
Since four of their seven regulars
are of Olympic Games experience,
the clubmen compose one of the
greatest teams of all time. Each of
the* Winged "O" players is at least
nationally famous. Five of this sep
tet are former Stanford players, in
cluding three veterans of the Games.
Mitchell, Wiget Star
Probably the most outstanding of
the Post Streeters is George Mitch
ell, California graduate and captain
of both the 1924 and 1928 Olympic
Games teams. Mitchell, who has
yet to slow up, has been rated by
critics as the greatest guard of all
time.
The club's leading offensive threat
to break Stanford's winning streak
is Ted Wiget, ace sprint, who starred
for three years ending in 1933 on
champion Cardinal swimming and
water polo teams. Wiget won three
National Intercollegiate swimming
titles for Stanford, and was a mem
ber of the 1932 Olympic team.
Ex-Cards Lead Club
Other club stars who led Nort
Thornton's Indian teams *o victory
within recent years include Milton
"Whitey" Burns, Gordy Graves, El
mer Collette, and "Ginger" Austin.
Graves, who played for Stanford last
winter, was the greatest guard that
the Indians ever had, and is rated
above Mitchell by Coach Thornton.
