# EX COMMITTEE MEETS TONIGHT
## Daily Matters Will Be Up For Discussion 
### 
The Stanford Daily will take the
center of the stage at Ex Committee
meeting tonight, when two contro
versial Daily matters will be con
sidered: a ntw proposition advanced
by Ben Cave, student manager, to
take from The Daily 15 cents out of
money appropriated from each stu
dent's community fees; and the old
thorn in Ex Committee's flesh, the
Daily election system.
Cave proposes to use the Daily's la
cents to add to the A.S.S.U.'s $12,000
surplus, or for several projects, the
nature of which he will not reveal
until the meeting tonight.
Stan Beaubaire, Daily editor, op
poses the change, saying that The
Daily can use the money to better
advantage than the student body
can by expending the money for
additional cuts and local pictures.
Three plans have been suggested
for solutions to the Daily election
muddle. One will be the original
suggestion, which was adopted unan
imously by the Publications Council
and provides for the giving of five
votes to the editor, three to the edi
torial board, two to night editors, one
to copy editors and department
heads and freshmen who have been
on the staff for four quarters.
Dave Mellinkofl is opposing this
plan on the grounds that it leans
toward the centralization of power.
He bases his plan primarily on se
niority. A sub-committee of Ex
Committee composed of A1 Black
man, Vivian Kay, and Sam Lee, has
prepared the 1 third plan and will
present it tonight.
Only other business scheduled for
tonight's meeting is a report on the
new theatre by Helen Ray.
