# 'KING LEAR' IS FIRST PLAY BY THORNTON CAST
## Shakespearean Troupe To Play in Assembly Hall Tomorrow Night 
### Mary Mayer 
Presenting "Xing Lear," consid
ered to be the finest role in his
repertoire, William Thornton will
appear tomorrow night in the As
sembly Hall at 8:15 o'clock.
Thornton's characterization of the
mad ruler has been considered one
that would be a credit to a more
mature actor. Although young in
years, Thornton has had much ex
perience, some of it gained at Stan
ford, where he first played the role
of Macbeth. It was also here that he
played Polonius in the modern
dress version of "Hamlet."
The company supporting Thorn
ton appears to good advantage in the
presentation of "King Lear." Phoebe
Clark as Goneril, one of Lear's
daughters, plays the vindicative
woman, and reads the lines with
appreciation of their powerful mean
ing.
Brauns To Appear
Stanford's Robert Brauns appears
as steward to Goneril. He is also
assistant manager for the Thornton
company. Many in tomorrow eve
ning's audience will remember
Brauns in campus plays and read
ings, and in Palo Alto Community
Playhouse shows in which he has
starred.
The first scene of "King Lear,"
usually omitted, is included by
Thornton's company. It is the scene
in which Lear abdicates in favor of
his daughters, after cursir.g his
youngest, Cordelia, because she re
fused to do lip service in telling
him how much she loved her father.
Her portion is given to her sisters,
and she goes a penniless bride to
the king of France. Thornton plays
this scene with a good climax to his
rising anger at Cordelia.
'Shrew' To Be Given
Contrasting with the tragedy of
"King Lear," Thornton's company
will present the comic "The Taming
of the Shrew" at 2:30 o'clock tomor
row afternoon. The youth of the
players is seen in their exuberance
in the comedy.
Seats for both performances are
now available at the bookstore on
the campus and at Keeble's in Palo
Alto. They are on sale for 50 cents,
75 cents, and $1 for the evening per
formance, and 50 cents, 75 cents, and
a special student rate of 35 cents for
the matinee.
The presentation by the English
Club of the "Thornton group will
mark the first appearance of p pro
fessional company at the University
in 20 years.
