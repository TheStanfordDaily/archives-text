# Ex Committee O.K. Given New 'Daily' Election Program
## Student Heads Vote Money To Provide Additional Pictorial Interest 
### 
Charges and counter charges were
flying across Ex Committee's long,
oval table last night as two im
portant projects affecting the future
of Tiie Daily were being considered.
After two hours of heated argu
ments and strained silences, the
committee decided to accept the
Editorial Board's recommendation in
regard to Daily elections and to give
the editorial staff of The Daily 15
cents per student each quarter to
improve the paper.
The Daily election system is a
change from the original plan
proposed by Publications Council.
It provides that the editor will be
elected by a stafT vote. Members
of the editorial staff will possess
votes as follows:
Feature editor, Associated Press
editor, sports editor, and other mem
bers of the staff who have served
at least three complete quarters,
one vote; night editors, not more than
six in number, and editorial board
members with the exception of the
editor, two votes; the editor, four
votes.

Under an emergency clause the
present news editor and the alter
nate night editor will be allowed
two votes in the next election in
February. After that election, the
news editor will not be on the edi
torial board, and there will be no
official alternate night editors.
The proposal to give The Daily
15 cents out of the 75 cents sub
scription fee in the student com
munity dollar for editorial improve
ment of The Daily with cuts, pic
tures, and page increases was
evolved after a lengthy argument.
Student Manager Ben Cave had
proposed to Ex Committee originally
that the 15 cents be taken away from
Tlu> Daily entirely, because, "Once
The Daily gets its tongs on ihe mon
ey, we can't get at it." He suggested
that the money might be used for
the new iheatrc.
During the heat of the argument,
a knock on the door was heard and
a voice said: "Could I get a story for
The Daily?" It wasn't a gag line,
but to a wrought-up Ex Committee
it sounded like it. At another tense
moment Helen Ray expressed the
idea lhat she was afraid the 15 cents
would be subject to graft. Chuck
Glasgow spoke up: "May I ease
Helen's mind on the subject?"
"You may ease her mind, after
<hr; meeting," said President Marvie
Kahn.
Prolonged student agitation and
disorder has caused the closing of
the University of Nueva Leon in
Mexico.
