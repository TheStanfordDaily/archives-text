# PYRE TO HAVE 25 FOOT BASE
## Aid Expected from All Men In Constructions 
### 
''Rome wasn't built in a day, but j
the Stanford bonfire will be." So i
runs the slogan of the Big Game
Bonfire committees.
With a base of 25 to 30 feet and a
height dependent upon the co-opera
tion of the student body the frame
work of the fire threatens to equal
?ny of the many former bonfires in
size.
"An important thing to remember,
incident to the successful building of
a big pyre," says Bob Jones, chair
man of the committee supervising
the fire," is that the entire student
body is building it, not merely the
freshmen. The better the turnout,
the higher the flame will flare."
To Campus for Aid
The campus will be covered by
representatives who will determine
the free hours of students and give
each a certain time for working.
The committee covering the fra
ternities consists of Tony Cockins,
chairman, Johnny Martin, Jceb
Halaby, Barney Vierling, and Dan
Clark. Canvassing the men's halls
are Cabby Caballero, Brower Del
linger, Rupert Prohme, and Phil
Coghlan. Sorority representative is
Jean Anderson who will see that the
women on the Row also do their
part.
Committees Named
Jim Woolley, superintending
trucking operations, has named Rex
Hardy, Barney Smith, Frank Tre
maine, Laurie Lapidus, Ed Clark,
