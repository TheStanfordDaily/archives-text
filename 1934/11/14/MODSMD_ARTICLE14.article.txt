# University Has Never Adopted Official Motto

Has Stanford University a motto? |
"The Wind of Freedom Is Blow- ,
ing," intermittently graced the |
Stanford Daily mast-head in Old,
English type last winter. The Ger
man equivalent, "Die Luft der Frci- I
licit Wcht" is inscribed in raised
capitals on the east-bronze univer
sity seal placed , on the speaker's!
rostrum stand of the Assembly Hall, j
Seal Only Temporary
A temporary university seal first I
used this legend, which has a four- i
century historical heritage behind it.
It has not been officially adopted and
does not now appear on the univer
sity seal.
Dr. Anthony Eugene Sokol, as
sistant professor of German and an
expert in German literature, when
asked the origin of this phrase, ex
plained that it was derived from an
utterance in the sixteenth century i
by Baron Ulrich vgn Huttcn of the |

Bavarian Palatinate nobility, during
the religious struggles which then
convulsed Germany.
"The Wind of Freedom"
"Baron Ulrich von Hutten was a
friend to the reformer Martin Lu
ther," Dr. Sokol explains, "and dur
ing the trial of Luther before the
Diet of Worms, von Hutten issued a
stirring appeal in the religious
leader's behalf, uttering the famous
words: "Sehet ihr nicht das die Luft
der Freiheit wcht?" ("Do you not
see that the wind of freedom is
blowing?")
It is not customary to employ a
motto from a living language as a
university legend. "Semper virens,"
meaning "ever green," or "ever
growing," referring to the redwood
tree of the Stanford seal, has been
considered as a motto from the
Latin, but was never officially
adopted.
