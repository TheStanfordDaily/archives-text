## William Thornton, Former Farm Student, Stars In Lead Roles 
### Mary Mayer 
The first professional company to

sperean players will a fiord faeulty
and students a true .dramatic treat
by their presentations today.

Taming, of the Shrew" will com
mence at 2:30 o'clock. In the eve
ning, "King Lear" will start at 8:15
o'clock.

the Shrew" Miss Sianina appears in

Versatile Star
As King Lear, Thornton gives the
best role in his repertoire. As Pe
truchio, he is colorful and vivid. The j
two parts so diametrically opposed— .
a mad monarch and a comic com- '
moner—permit him to give a full j
exposition of his histrionic ability.
Although yet under 30, his experi- j
ence has been acquired over a pe
riod of many years. Thornton's first
attempts at Shakespeare were made
while he was attending Stanford.
The plays are sponsored by the
English Club and presented by the
Shakespeare Guild of America.
Thornton and his company have
been praised by superlative com
ments of critics throughout the na
tion.

ing roles in the two plays are:

erina is a daughter of Baptisla, a
rich gentleman of Padua, and mar
ries Petruchio of Verona, played by

delia, will be played by Phoebe

sperean players will a fiord faeulty
and students a true .dramatic treat
by their presentations today.

the Shrew" Miss Sianina appears in

Brauns is cast as Biondello, a serv
ant. In "King Lear" Miss Sianina j
plays the part of servant to the Earl
of Gloucester, and Brauns portrays
steward to Goneril.
Versatile Star
As King Lear, Thornton gives the
best role in his repertoire. As Pe
truchio, he is colorful and vivid. The j
two parts so diametrically opposed— .
a mad monarch and a comic com- '
moner—permit him to give a full j
exposition of his histrionic ability.
Although yet under 30, his experi- j
ence has been acquired over a pe
riod of many years. Thornton's first
attempts at Shakespeare were made
while he was attending Stanford.
The plays are sponsored by the
English Club and presented by the
Shakespeare Guild of America.
Thornton and his company have
been praised by superlative com
ments of critics throughout the na
tion.
