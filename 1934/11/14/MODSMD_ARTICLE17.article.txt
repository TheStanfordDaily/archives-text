# Wants Grid Games Kept Off the Air
## Masters Says Broadcasts Hurt Attendance 
### (By Associated Press 
Pacific Coast Conference football
may go off the air next season if
Alfred Master's policy of opposition
to broadcasts is put into effect.
"I am convinced the broadcasting
is hurting and will continue to hurt
our attendances," said Masters,
"Graduate Bill Monahan, I believe,
feels the same way about it."
"Something will have to be done
on the matter. If not, the time may
come when the colleges will be run
of the football business. I think
every conference representative will
be prepared to discuss this phase
of the game coverage at the next
meeting. We have tried out the
broadcasting for years and my argu
ment is we should give it a trial the
other v/ay to see if attendance will
not pick up."
Stanford attendances, according to
Masters, are about even with last
year but in his opinion "they should
have been much larger this season,
with a winning team and a strong
schedule."
Increasing objection to the broad
casting of games is reported to have
reached the point with major mem
bers of the conference where the
question will be re-opened at the
annual meeting in Los Angeles next
month.
Broadcasting privileges have re
turned dividends to the conference
members the last two seasons. An
oil company paid $60,000 this year
and last for the right to put. all con
ference contests on the air. These
sums were divided among the 10
conference schools, according to the
number of games handled and their
importance.
