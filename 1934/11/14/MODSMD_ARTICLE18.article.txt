Before a small but appreciative
audience, two Stanford women par
ticipated at 7:30 o'clock last night
in the Women's Clubhouse in a non
decision debate with representatives
from the Parliament debating society
of the University of California.
Benita Calmcnson and Frances
Strong, debating for Stanford, up
held the affirmative of the question,
Resolved: that the nations should
agree to prevent the international
shipment of arms and munitions, and
Gertrude McSpedden and Lucille
Dunham took the negative for Cali
fornia. Ed Janss was chairman of
the debate.
The question, chosen by Pi Kappa
Delta, national debating fraternity, is
particularly appropriate today in
view of investigations of munitions
concerns in Congress and the pres
ent "war scare."
The debaters made their argu
ments forceful and clear, the affirm
ative's main contentions being that
the elimination of the international
arms salesmen which the present
system encourages would help elim
inate war scares and therefore would
aid the cause of peace. The nega
tive's main contention was that
precedence has shown that previous
international treaties have failed in
crises and that the nations would
not be able to prevent the shipment
of raw materials which might be
used in the manufacture of arms.
Barbara Sweet and Miriam Wolff
went to Berkeley last night to up
hold the negative of the same ques
tion there, with other members of
Parliament debating society.

new tuition notes for the winter
