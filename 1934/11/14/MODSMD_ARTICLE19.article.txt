# Women's Group Votes To Retain Leave Revision
## Conference Members Cast Ballots Following Lengthy Discussions of Problem in Living Groups; Regulation Carries by 2-3 Majority NEW RULES BECOME EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY Livery Overnight Leave To Count on Quota as 2:30; Upperclass Women Receive Five "Floaters" 
### DOROTHY SWEET 
The late leave revision scheme was again passed hy Women's Confer
ence yesterday. After a rehearing of the pros ami cons of the late leave
situation, representatives from each living group expressed the majority
and minority opinions of their group.
Conference President Marion Storey called for a vote after she had
instructed the conference to keep in mind the opinion and the host interests

-â™¦of the group as a whole. Each voter
j v/as asked to cast her ballot as an
individual, however. The revision
| was passed by a two-thirds majority.
The new rules, which went into
effect last night, state that every
overnight leave taken by a Stanford

woman be counted as a 2:30 late
leave on her quota. The number of
"floating" 2:30 leaves for women who
are not freshmen and who have a C
average or above has been increased
from three to five.
The part of the social regulations
that reads that not more than one
"floating" leave can be used in one
week, the conference voted to strike
from the record.
As an interpretation rather than
as a part of the revision, the con
ference decided that all "floating"
2:30 leaves used by freshmen women
in the month of October should not
be counted on their quota. These
"floaters" were taken before the
freshmen knew that their week-end
privileges were to be limited.
