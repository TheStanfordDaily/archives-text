Last night Marion Storey
said: "According to A.S.S.U.
constitutional provisions, to
Women's Conference has been
delegated all legislation con
cerning the conduct of Stanford
women students. Conference
members are elected delegates
of their living groups.
"The conference has tho
roughly discussed the present
problem and, after following
rigidly our procedure, a vote
was taken today 011 the pro
jected revision. The revision
Was passed by more than the
necessary two-thirds vote."
