# On the Independence Of Stanford Women
## 
### 
Women's Conference met yesterday, rear
firmed last week's decision curtailing the use
of "2:30" late leaves, a decision that had
met with ;i good deal of popular opposition
among the women themselves. The merit of
that action, as il affects the majority of the
women (sophomores or above) is not for the
Daily to question. Hut the poor, bewildered
freshman apparently takes it smack on the
sehnozzlc.
Freshman women, under the new system,
are in a had way if they should prove at all
popular with the Stanford rough, In the "good
old days," which many of lis would welcome
with open arms in many ways, a Stanford
woman had some sense and we were proud
of the fact. She didn't run around much dur
ing the week, being limited to a certain 1111111-
i»cr of nights "out," but when it came Friday
and Saturday, she could (if asked) go to the
city dancing until 2: H() both evenings. Those
who wished could visit friends or parents
those evenings, and stay al f their own homes
11 the desire arose,
Today, the freshman is still a freshman,
and as popular as ever. She may stay out until
12 o'clock a certain few evenings, and may
remain away from Rojile as late as 2:30
o'clock once a week (including week-ends)
regularly, and live times during the quarter
may exercise the optional privilege of an ad
ditional evening of freedom. She cannot, at
any cost, stay out after midnight every Fri
day and Saturday during the quarter—two
days when every man and woman on the
campus likes to have a good time, forget rou
tine studying for the while.
The mere fact that freshmen who, away
from home possibly for the first-period of
any duration, might naturally wish to spend
a few week-ends with their parents who live
near by, i*s something else to consider. If a
Stanford woman goes home overnight, the
adventure is counted as one of her 2: 30 late
leaves. For the pitiable freshman, who is en
titled to but one leave a week plus the five
"lloaters," il is a sad state of affairs.
II may not be justice, and it may be a good
system after all. The whole thing was passed
by Women's Conference, an organization
where the women are represented by groups,
but where the representatives are reminded
to vote according to their own personal opin
ions rather than be instructed by their living
group constituencies.
If il is a good system, the Daily fails to see
any balance in its favor. Modified, with some
leniency to aid freshmen rather than hinder
lliem, to make Stanford women realize that
I his is :i democratic university and lo love
Stanford for the fact, the regulations would
be satisfactory to all.
