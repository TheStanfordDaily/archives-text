# Out of the Darkness
## 
### 
Stumbling through the svgian depths he
hind the library at eleven o'clock at night—
darkness thai is a color symphony of the
I slack Hole of Calcutta —a senior and four
year resident of the I Diversity's halls felt the
unfamiliar impact of a smooth, springy path
beneath his feet.
Humbly falling on his knees and kissing its
moist and tarry sweetness he shouted: "Allah
ebd Allah, Din, Din, Din! Allah be praised*
The Administration be praised! Al Roth be
praised! Allah is merciful."
Yes, gentlemen, our idealism has not been
futile. There is a path from Kneina to the
Kngineering corner that would warm the heart
of the sourest sophomore. It is a real path,
not a seraping together ol gravel, and a steel
fence is being constructed to protect the path
and the pedestrian's life and limb from mean
dering racing pilots.
The harvest has been long a-growing, but
the fruit is sweet. Congrats, Administration!
