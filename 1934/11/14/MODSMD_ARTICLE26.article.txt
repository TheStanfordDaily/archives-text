Because of their proximity to chortling,
swashbuckling Kingfish Hucy Long, students
of Louisiana State University are obtaining
thorough and praetieal extraneous courses in
last and loose applied polities. Marelv do
twenty-four hours pass without an illuminat
ing eruption from that past master of publicity
and custard pie political erudition.
Two wee Us ago lie look steps to provide all
Louisiana State students who wanted it, seven

dollurs to enable them to follow the football
team to its big game. This week he started
his political machine rolling in a campaign
to ileelare a statutory moratorium on all debts
within the state of eight dollars or over; thus
saving his elaiin to the students' borrowings.
Last Monday he declared himself ready to
begin a drive curtailing the number of chicken
necks and wings handed out in restaurants.
Wednesday the state legislature convened;
and with the opening ceremonies Huev was
hopping and capering around in nil quarters,
preparing a melodrama equal to the occasion,
lie plotted a rare show; pulled the strings
while Louisiana State students mass-met and
elected a football player as state senator to
represent East Baton Rouge.
Hut when curtain time ncared, the football
player, sufl'ering either a belated sense of
dignity or stage fright, refused to go on.
State senate oldsters came near sending a ser
geant-al-arms to arrest the miscreant; but
later relented and gave him live days' leave
of absence that he might practice football and
study his lessons. Meanwhile the student
athlete-senator was losing his ten dollars per
diem wage as a legislator.
Master of ceremonies Huev may repent of
his scheme : evidently the footballer has brains
and independence, which, commonly consid
ered as laudable attributes, amount to super
fluities under a dictatorship.
At least the Kinghsh has uncovered a new
celebrity for his kingdom. The celebrities
now number three: Maestro Long himself;
(ieorge Torrence, the world champion sliol
piitter; and Abe Mickal, the college football
star who wouldn't trade his moleskins for a
senatorial toga.
