### CEDRIC LARSON 
WITH DEAN GRAYSON N. KEFAUVER
Frank N. Belgrano, Jr., 1934-35 American Legion
chief, in a much publicized Armistice Day address
before the tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington
National Cemetery, warned America of danger from
radicalism, which he fpund to be a "more dangerous
foe than the one we fought in the open during the
war."
Memories of the recent San Francisco general
strike, Sinclair's hectic gubernatorial campaign,
and various autumnal "red" scares no doubt
haunt the commander's mind. Belgrano is a
California, a San Franciscan and a banker. He
proceeds with a blanket indictment: "This- new
foe has seeped quietly into our country and whis
pered into the ears of our workers and our people
everywhere that our ideals of government are out
of date."
"Our people everywhere" is a sweeping statement,
and implicates per se our schools. Are such charges
warranted?
Dr. Grayson N. Kefauver, dean of the School of
Education, analyzes this situation: "The fundamental
social changes during the past quarter of a century
have made the social and economic conditions more
complex and more difficult to understand. Basic
alterations have been made in our governmental ma
chinery during this period.
Still more important changes are believed by some
to be desirable or necessary. Whether important ad
justments should be made in our governmental ma
chinery and the nature of those innovations are issues
which must be decided by the people. The democratic
pxocedure requires that the people make these im
portant decisions on the basis of such understanding
as they can develop.
"There is somewhat general acceptance of the
fact that at the present time the great majority of
people are not sufficiently informed to act intel
ligently. Too many can be moved either to support
some new but impracticable idea or to support
plans of action which served well in the past but
which prove to be inadequate under present-day
conditions.
"The building of understanding of existing condi
tions and of the proposals for the improvement of
those conditions with the claims and merits ot those
proposals, leading to a higher level of social compe
tence, constitutes the most important task of the
educational institutions of the country.
"The task of social training is made difficult in
many communities by the unwillingness of certain
minority groups to allow a study of all aspccts of
important controversial questions. The school admin
istrator and the teacher are sometimes subjected to
attack by special interests. The liberal point of view
is hammered especially hard.
"During the past year wo have heard a great deal
about Communistic teachings in schools. Important
organizations have passed resolutions aimed to purge
the schools of 'subversive' teachings. Two things
might be said about this attack. First, there is very
little or no undemocratic teaching in our high schools
and colleges. The study of all points of view of
important problems should not be interpreted as a
defense by the teacher of all the different aspects under
consideration.
"Second, the undemocratic activity of certain
groups in attempting to hold out of educational in
stitutions points of view which they, disapprove,
constitutes the most serious hazard in developing
an effective program of social training. Students
should have the freedom to form their own judg
ment in the light of that study.
"To attbek those who do not agree witli us and to
attempt to force others to conform to our thinking
would be appropriate in a fascist society but it is out
of place in a democracy. In fact, if such a condition
becomes widespread, the most important element of
democracy will have passed away."

Dr. Grayson N. Kefauver, dean of the School of
Education, analyzes this situation: "The fundamental
social changes during the past quarter of a century
have made the social and economic conditions more
complex and more difficult to understand. Basic
alterations have been made in our governmental ma
chinery during this period.
Still more important changes are believed by some
to be desirable or necessary. Whether important ad
justments should be made in our governmental ma
chinery and the nature of those innovations are issues
which must be decided by the people. The democratic
pxocedure requires that the people make these im
portant decisions on the basis of such understanding
as they can develop.
"There is somewhat general acceptance of the
fact that at the present time the great majority of
people are not sufficiently informed to act intel
ligently. Too many can be moved either to support
some new but impracticable idea or to support
plans of action which served well in the past but
which prove to be inadequate under present-day
conditions.
"The building of understanding of existing condi
tions and of the proposals for the improvement of
those conditions with the claims and merits ot those
proposals, leading to a higher level of social compe
tence, constitutes the most important task of the
educational institutions of the country.
"The task of social training is made difficult in
many communities by the unwillingness of certain
minority groups to allow a study of all aspccts of
important controversial questions. The school admin
istrator and the teacher are sometimes subjected to
attack by special interests. The liberal point of view
is hammered especially hard.
"During the past year wo have heard a great deal
about Communistic teachings in schools. Important
organizations have passed resolutions aimed to purge
the schools of 'subversive' teachings. Two things
might be said about this attack. First, there is very
little or no undemocratic teaching in our high schools
and colleges. The study of all points of view of
important problems should not be interpreted as a
defense by the teacher of all the different aspects under
consideration.
"Second, the undemocratic activity of certain
groups in attempting to hold out of educational in
stitutions points of view which they, disapprove,
constitutes the most serious hazard in developing
an effective program of social training. Students
should have the freedom to form their own judg
ment in the light of that study.
"To attbek those who do not agree witli us and to
attempt to force others to conform to our thinking
would be appropriate in a fascist society but it is out
of place in a democracy. In fact, if such a condition
becomes widespread, the most important element of
democracy will have passed away."
WITH DEAN GRAYSON N. KEFAUVER
Frank N. Belgrano, Jr., 1934-35 American Legion
chief, in a much publicized Armistice Day address
before the tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington
National Cemetery, warned America of danger from
radicalism, which he fpund to be a "more dangerous
foe than the one we fought in the open during the
war."
Memories of the recent San Francisco general
strike, Sinclair's hectic gubernatorial campaign,
and various autumnal "red" scares no doubt
haunt the commander's mind. Belgrano is a
California, a San Franciscan and a banker. He
proceeds with a blanket indictment: "This- new
foe has seeped quietly into our country and whis
pered into the ears of our workers and our people
everywhere that our ideals of government are out
of date."
"Our people everywhere" is a sweeping statement,
and implicates per se our schools. Are such charges
warranted?
