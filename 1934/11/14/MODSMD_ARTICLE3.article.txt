# Progress Of Russia Told By Speaker
## McBain Describes Trip In Tuesday Lecture 
### Helen Warson 
Russia, "a country where depres
sion and unemployment ;fre un
known, where there is a tremendous
shortage of everything, including
people," was the topic of a lecture
given last night in the Assembly
Hall by Dr. J. W. Mcßain, Pro
fessor of Chemistry, who recently
returned from a visit to that country.
After leaving London on a Soviet
boat September 1, 1933, Dr. Mcßain
set out from Leningrad for a forty
day tour of Russia. From the former
capital city, laid by Peter the Great,
Dr. Mcßain traveled south to Mos
cow, and thence to the industrial
districts of the Dnieper.
Looks At New City
Following an inspection of the
gigantic' state and collective farms
near the newly built city of Kharkov,
he then made a three weeks motor
tour through the Caucasus. Dr.
Mcßain reports that the south coast
of Crimea, along the blue Mediter
ranean, is the most beautiful part of
Russia. He left from Kiev on Octo
ber 10.
Dr. Mcßain pointed out that visi
tors, particularly those who speak
the Russian language, are allowed
to travel unmolested throughout the
country. Through his acquaintance
with scientific men, he was able to
visit Russian homes, and to glean
actual "inside information."
Graft and corruption are absent
in the Russian government, Dr.
Mcßain commented. Overproduc
tion, he states, is inconceivable for
at least a century to some. Above
all the Russian wants peace, time to
work out the Great Plan, and he is
willing lo submit to • anything but
foreign invasion to get it.
Emphasizing the scope of the
national education project, Dr.
Mcßain stated that by 1937, the
Russian nation should be 100 per
cent literate. Every large center
of population has universities, poly
technica, and research institutes
which compare favorably with, and
often surpass, those in other nations.
The ordinary people are not for
bidden to own property. Dr. Mcßain
points out. They may earn all they
can, and they may amass all the
property they are able. The only
wealthy people in Russia, however,
are the artists, dramatists, writers,
and inventors.
Dr. Mcßain noticed a great lack
in Russia of the small things such
as Americans buy in Woolworth's
or Montgomery Ward's. The Russian
school children in one part of the
country, he found, were using rusty
razor blades to sharpen their pencils.

Mcßain commented. Overproduc
tion, he states, is inconceivable for
at least a century to some. Above
all the Russian wants peace, time to
work out the Great Plan, and he is
willing lo submit to • anything but
foreign invasion to get it.
Emphasizing the scope of the
national education project, Dr.
Mcßain stated that by 1937, the
Russian nation should be 100 per
cent literate. Every large center
of population has universities, poly
technica, and research institutes
which compare favorably with, and
often surpass, those in other nations.
The ordinary people are not for
bidden to own property. Dr. Mcßain
points out. They may earn all they
can, and they may amass all the
property they are able. The only
wealthy people in Russia, however,
are the artists, dramatists, writers,
and inventors.
Dr. Mcßain noticed a great lack
in Russia of the small things such
as Americans buy in Woolworth's
or Montgomery Ward's. The Russian
school children in one part of the
country, he found, were using rusty
razor blades to sharpen their pencils.
Russia, "a country where depres
sion and unemployment ;fre un
known, where there is a tremendous
shortage of everything, including
people," was the topic of a lecture
given last night in the Assembly
Hall by Dr. J. W. Mcßain, Pro
fessor of Chemistry, who recently
returned from a visit to that country.
After leaving London on a Soviet
boat September 1, 1933, Dr. Mcßain
set out from Leningrad for a forty
day tour of Russia. From the former
capital city, laid by Peter the Great,
Dr. Mcßain traveled south to Mos
cow, and thence to the industrial
districts of the Dnieper.
Looks At New City
Following an inspection of the
gigantic' state and collective farms
near the newly built city of Kharkov,
he then made a three weeks motor
tour through the Caucasus. Dr.
Mcßain reports that the south coast
of Crimea, along the blue Mediter
ranean, is the most beautiful part of
Russia. He left from Kiev on Octo
ber 10.
Dr. Mcßain pointed out that visi
tors, particularly those who speak
the Russian language, are allowed
to travel unmolested throughout the
country. Through his acquaintance
with scientific men, he was able to
visit Russian homes, and to glean
actual "inside information."
Graft and corruption are absent
in the Russian government, Dr.
Mcßain commented. Overproduc
tion, he states, is inconceivable for
at least a century to some. Above
all the Russian wants peace, time to
work out the Great Plan, and he is
willing lo submit to • anything but
