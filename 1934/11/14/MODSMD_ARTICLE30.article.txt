# WATER COLORS ON EXHIBIT IN GRAPHIC ART DEPARTMENT
## 
### 
Pictorial water colors and prob
lems in illustration are on exhibit
this week in the graphic art depart
ment lecture room.
The works are by Lee Blair and
â–  Mary Robinson Blair, former stu
! dents at the Chouinard Art School
! in Los Angeles. A joint exhibit re
cently given by them in the Los
Angeles Ambassador Hotel galleries
| received favorable comment from
Los Angeles critics.
Both artists have a fine sense of
character and pattern. Although
; their work is similar in style, Mrs.
Blair's shows more boldness, and
Blair's reveals more sensitivity. Both
j get rich and strong, dark and light
I effects in their water coloi's.
