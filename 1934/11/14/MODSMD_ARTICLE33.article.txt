WHICH ONES WILL
get invitation?

Some of the figures that are keep
ing Rose Bowl committeemen awake,
these nights:
Pts.!
West W. L. T. Pts. Agst.
Stanford 7 0 1 162 7 |
Santa Clara .... 6 0 1 114 13
Wash. State 4 2 0 108 22 I
Washington 4 1 0 56 44 I
Pts.
East W. L. T. Pts. Agst. j
Princeton (i 0 0 242 18 j
Minnesota 5 0 0 181 31
Alabama 7 0 0 213 26 ;
Syracuse 6 0 0 139 7 '
Navy 7 0 0 128 39 i
Illinois 6 0 0 04 36
Temple 6 0 1 189 37 ,
Pittsburgh 6 1 0 154 31 \
Louisiana State.. 6 0 1 319 32
On the Coast, it looks like Stanford
will get first chance ;it the bid, with
out much question, if the Indians win
the Big Game.
Stanford's smashing victory over |
Washington eliminated the Huskies,!
and Washington State already has j
two defeats by non-conference teams |
to mar its record. Santa Clara, not
included in the conference, will not ;
be considered in the conference's j
Rose Bowl selection plans.

EASTERN RULINGS
ARK BOTHERSOME

From here, it seems that Minne- i
sota and Princeton are the most de- j
su able eastern opponents for the!
Indians; that is, oi course, if Stan- j
ford beats California.
But the Gophers and Tigers ,
each have rulings in their own
particular circles that make post- I
season competition, under which |
lieading the Pasadena contest
comes, taboo. However Minne
sota, the rumor goes, is prac- j
tically in a position to tell the |
Big Ten Conference ''where to get !
off," and the Gophers may consider
a bid if it is extended.
Princeton, likewise, is striving to j
do something about junking its J
agreement with Harvard end Yale j
not to participate in post-season
games.
So maybe one of these teams would j
acgept a Rose Bowl invitation, after i
all.

ALABAMA, SYRACUSE
NEXT BEST BETS

Alabama and Syracuse at this date
are choices number three and four.
Neither has been beaten. Syracuse |
has had only seven points scored on j
her this year and she entered the |
serious figuring by her 10 to 0 upset |
of Michigan State, prids of the Mid- j
West, last week. Alabama has con- j
sistently been piling up scores
against the best of southern schools. ]
It is believed that either of these j
teams would accept a Rose Bowl bid
were* it offered.
Navy has a good ball club, hut
there are tv\o drawbacks here. '
First, it is not known whether the |
government would permit the mid
dies to play on New Year's Day.
Second, Navy has a good chance of
being beaten by Army, and also by
Pittsburgh.
Illinois, another undefeated, un
tied team, is also in the Big Ten, and :
would have to take second choice to j
Minnesota, so the Illini probably will i
not get, or accept, the bid.
Then there is Pop Warner's| j
Temple team, unbeaten, tied once,
and showing strength all through.
The Temple schedule, however, is
against her, and the Rose Bowl i
committee will undoubtedly ask a j
team that has played tougher !
games.
Pittsburgh, favored to topple Navy ;
this Saturday, has one defeat, suf- j
fered at the hands of Minnesota, to !
mar its record; but the Panthers may !
Ik> chosen, anyway. They probably !
would accept, in their efforts to re- !
venge a lop-sided defeat by U.S.C. j
iwo years ago in the Pasadena game, j
Pitt has a good team, and is not far ;
out of the class of Minnesota and j
Princeton.

L S.U. MIGHT COME
AS LAST KESORT

Huey Long's Louisiana State team j
in the South, ballyhooed as much as j
;my team in the country, although j
most of the talk comes directly from
Mr. Long, has been tied once, and j
has played an easy schedule. The '
Louisiana militarists will be chosen
only as a last resort.
Those are the outstanding possi
bilities now, but the committee has

not completely discarded Army,
Dartmouth, Colgate (which will play, 1
and possibly defeat, Syracuse Sat-j
urday), and Rice. The former three
have been defeated once, each game i
being an upset under uncommon j
conditions, and Rice has been tied '
twice in the tough Southern league. I
