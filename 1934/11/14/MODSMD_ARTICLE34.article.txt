# Tiny Runs Signal Drill, Passes Up Scrimmage
## LITTLE LET-DOWN OFFERED GRIDMEN BY OLYMPIC CLUB 
### 
Instead of the expected scrim- j
mage, Coach Tiny Thornhill sent i
> the Indian varsity through an hour !
and a half of .signal drill yesterday
i afternoon, as the bruising footbll of
Saturday's Washington game showed
| up in sore muscles and general stiff-
I ness.
Work Out New Plays
Bones Hamilton did not report for
practice, but spent the afternoon
trying to get rid of general sore
ness. Bob Black's sprained ankle
i kept him out of a uniform also, but
the remainder of the injuries were
I of a minor nature.
Work on the dummy machine was
mainly devoted to smoothing # out a
i pair of power plays which Thornhill I
i gave the varsity yesterday. The '
plays are reverses to the quarter-
I back and are directed over the two :
I guard holes. Evidently Frank Alus
-1 tiza's newly displayed drive as a
j line puncher will be utilized to re
| lieve Bobby Grayson on the bucks
Olympians Not Easy
While the incentive to bpat the
j Olympic Club, next Saturday's op-
I ponents, will be less than for a -
| college rival, Stanford backers are
! pointing to the season record of the j
I Winged <k O" gridders to show that |
j the Cards must not permit a let
j down Saturday if they intend to keep
i an unbeaten record. On the basis of!
| comparative scores, Stanford should
j beat the club by just one touchdown.
While the Olympic Club's record
: is as erratic as usual, Mike Voyne's
| men have held down Santa Clara
and San Francisco University to
j one touchdown wins. The Cards 1
tied Santa Clara 7-7, the Olympic 1
, Club lost by a 13-6' score. The club's
i 6-0 loss to S.F.U., as against the In
dians' 3-0 victory, is another proof
I that once again an expected "breath
er" will be a tough ball game.
