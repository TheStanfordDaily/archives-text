# WATER POLO TEAM RISKS UNDEFEATED RECORD IN GAME WITH OLYMPIC CLUB
## 
### 
Water polo rivalry of 20 years'
standing will flare up again wheri
Stanford and the Olympic Club tan
i gle in a championship game at 1
o'clock Saturday afternoon in En
cina pool. Either the Cardinals or
the Olympians have dominated the
I aquatic sport in the Bay region each
| season for the past two decades.
I Every year until 1932, the club
men took the measure of Stanford,
along with their other opponents.
For a long period of power, they
won every game on their schedules.
Two years ago the tide finally
turned, and the Indians gained an
even split with the club in two
games.
4 Wins Start Drive-
Last fall and winter, Nort Thorn
ton's Cards, starting their drive to
water polo greatness, the
Olympians in four straight contests.
These victories contributed to the
| fine record which the Stanford sep
tet has made since 1932. During that
year the Northern California Water
Polo League was formed, and the
! Indians have yet to lose a league
; game.
As a result of this string of wins,
the Cards are both defending cham
pions and current league leaders, in
search of their 19th straight tri
umph Saturday. They are doubly in
danger, since the Olympians threat
en both to tie them for the top spot

! in the standings and to ruin that
: fine record. A club victory Satur
day v/ould pull Stanford down to a
triple tie with California and the
Winged "O" paddlers.
Jayvee Teams Meet
In a preliminary to the varsity
l struggle, the Stanford junior varsity
will play the Olympic Club reserves
at 12 o'clock. In this game the club-
I men, as well as the Cardinals, will
be out to break their tie for first
place in the junior division of the
I league.
Proving themselves better, by
I comparative scores, than the U.S.C.
varsity, the Stanford frosh recently
played a regulation game with the
Indian varsity l.osing by a margin
of 13 to 4. Ordinarily, in these
i clashes, the teams swap goalies, with
j Bob Haslacher stopping many of
I the varsity shots, to help the frosh.
, Frosh Keep Goalie
! This time the frosh said they could
j get along with Sanford Lohengarl,
I their own goal guard, and gave Cap
i tain Leo Cook and his cohorts a
| harder game than the Trojans, who
| lost 13 to 2 in Encina pool ten days
| ago, could give them.
Cook, as usual, led the scoring
1 with eight goals, but Warren Smith
j and Stan Wilson looked good for
) the yearlings by counting twice each,
j while Bill Woodard, star varsity
I guprd, held Jack Loupe scoreless.
