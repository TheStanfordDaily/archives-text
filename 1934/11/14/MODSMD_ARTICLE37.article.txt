### 
Approximately 90 basketball play
ers are working out in the Pavilion
l every afternoon from 2 until 6
i o'clock in preparation for the coming
season.
With their duties as freshman
football coaches brought to a close
for this year, John Bunn and Jimmy
, Bradshaw have turned their atten
; tion to the forming of their respec
i tive varsity and freshman squads.
Bunn at present has a squad of 54
! from which to form the nucleus of
| Stanford's vai'sity team. Indications
( 'show that this year's team will be
somewhat smaller in height than
those of previous years, but will
make up for the deficiency in its
fast break and numerous high scor
-1 ing forwards.
