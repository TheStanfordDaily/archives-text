TODAY'S GAME
Phi Delta Thcla vs. Business School,
frosh football fluid, 4 o'clock

Football almost faded out of the
picture yesterday in intramural
sport at the frosh fields when Se
quoia II failed to show up for their
game with Delta Upsilon. But Se
quoia I, champions of League 8,
substituted, and with Bill Ladue
starring, beat the D.U. team 21 to 0.
In golf D.U., after beating the
Betas in round one, continued on to
beat Delta Chi 4 and 2.
D.K.E. beat the Forger II golfers;
Zeta Psi beat Phi Sigma Kappa;
Phi Gamma Delta beat Theta Chi
1 up on the 20th; Sigma Chi beat
A.T.0.; Phi Kappa Sigma beat Sigma
Nu; S.A.E. beat Los Arcos 4 and 2;
and Forgers I won by default from
the Business School.
Dante Lembi and Waldo Munday,
Sequoia's handball champs of last
year, continued their march in this
year's tournament by winning from
Delta Upsilon. Lembi's match
against Archie Zamloch of D.U. pro
duced some first class play.
Other results of the handball
tournament found El Capitan beat
ing El Cuadro, Forgers beating Los
Arcos, and the Betas beating Theta
Chi.
