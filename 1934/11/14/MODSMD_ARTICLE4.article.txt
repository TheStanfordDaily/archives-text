# Pick Songs For Gaieties
## 
### 
j Originality, traditionally the key
! note of Big Game Gaieties, will again
j come to the fore in song features of
| this year's performance, for Novem
-1 ber 23 in the Assembly Hall.
Four numbers by Stanford stu
j dents have been tentatively selected
for spotlight posts in the program,
j They include â€¢ "Major in Love,"
j "Sweet," "A Week Ago Saturday,"
j and "Spring."
Norman Sears, responsible for
; both the words and music of the
j last two, will sing his own songs.
| Sears has the distinction of having
I had several numbers published, and
j is an experienced soloist.
"Sweet" is the result of the labors
of Winstead Weaver, who needs no
introduction to campus audiences.
It will be sung by either A1 Wood
! ward, Dick Cramer, Trow Harper,
j or Drayton Bryant, who are to try
j out tonight at 10:15 o'clock.
At the same time Leona Hirsch
j field, Barbara Patton, and Ruth Wil
j liams will vie for the honor of sing
j ing "Major in Love."
Other musical features, including
iPi Phi and Tri Delt skits and a
Weaver specialty, will also be high-
I lights of the production.
