# NEW COURSE WILL DEAL WITH SOCIAL CHANGE IN RUSSIA
## 
### 
"Social Movements in Russia" is
the name of an entirely new course
to be given at Stanford in the Slavic
department next quarter by Dr.
Anatolt G. Mazour.
Dealing primarily with the rise
of the social classes in Russia, the
course will touch upon the history
of the peasant class, the labor class,
and the nobility. The rise of serf
dom and the Russian industry will
also be taken up.
Gives Background
This course serves as a good back
ground of Russia up to 1905 by its
thorough study of the social, eco
nomic, and political forces that
brought about the Russian revolu
tion in 1917.
Dr. Mazour stresses the fact that
a knowledge of the history of the
eastern part of Europe is just as im
portant as that of the western part.
Regardless of what form of govern
ment Russia has, he continued, the
ration goes on, and the understand
ing of the people is important.
Of special interest to the students
of international trade, Mazour
pointed out that Siberia will become
of great importance in the economic
field, and that most of the trade will
be carried on between the United
States and Russia across the Pa
cific. In this respect, those on the
California coast will be most con
cerned.
Students Privileged
Students at Stanford are particu
larly privileged, Mazour added, be
cause the Hoover War Library of
fers excellent facilities in studying
Russian history, sociology, econom
ics, etc. The University of Califor
nia library is complementary with
respect to the material available in
the Stanford library on this phase,
and this convenience can not be
duplicated in any other part of this
country. But, Dr. Mazour stated,
the Hoover War Library is THE
library.
This course is a three-unit course,
to be given on Mondays, Wednes
days, and Fridays at 11 o'clock. It is
a one quarter course, and possibly
will be repeated in the spring quar
ter. A knowledge of French, Rus
sian, or any other language is de
sirable, but not mandatory.
Mazour New Here
Dr. Mazour is here at Stanford for
his first time, after being connected
with the University of California,

Austria. He is a graduate of the

Any student who desires to see
him concerning the course will find
Dr. Mazour in his office in room 91A
on Tuesdays from 10 to 11 o'clock.

cerned.
Students Privileged

country. But, Dr. Mazour stated,
the Hoover War Library is THE
library.

"Social Movements in Russia" is
the name of an entirely new course
to be given at Stanford in the Slavic
department next quarter by Dr.
Anatolt G. Mazour.
Dealing primarily with the rise
of the social classes in Russia, the
course will touch upon the history
of the peasant class, the labor class,
and the nobility. The rise of serf
dom and the Russian industry will
also be taken up.
Gives Background
This course serves as a good back
ground of Russia up to 1905 by its
thorough study of the social, eco
nomic, and political forces that
brought about the Russian revolu
tion in 1917.
Dr. Mazour stresses the fact that
a knowledge of the history of the
eastern part of Europe is just as im
portant as that of the western part.
Regardless of what form of govern
ment Russia has, he continued, the
ration goes on, and the understand
ing of the people is important.
Of special interest to the students
of international trade, Mazour
pointed out that Siberia will become
of great importance in the economic
field, and that most of the trade will
be carried on between the United
States and Russia across the Pa
cific. In this respect, those on the
California coast will be most con
cerned.
