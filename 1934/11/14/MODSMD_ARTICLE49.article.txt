"JUNO AND THE PAYCOCK"
Friday evening's production of
Sean O'Casey's "Juno and the Pay
cock ' at the Palo Alto Community
Theatre aroused polite, but slightly
bewildered and disappointed ap
plause. A splendid production jus
tified the polite applause; the disap
pointment and bewilderment arose
from the play itself.
For Sean O'Casey, in vulgar ter
minology, has set the New York
critics "on their ears" with his cur
rent success, "Within the Gates."
The meaningful symbolism of the
latter is hailed as a brilliant step
forward in the development of the
drama.
But nothing of this is found in
"Juno and the Paycock." It is,
rather, a very real and very ardent
propaganda play espousing the cause
of the Irish Free State and showing
the evils and hardships wrought by
political turmoil.
A. Grove Day's direction was
smooth and studied, and he is to
be commended for his courage in
producing such a difficult, dialectic
play. One minor criticism is that his
stage groupings were at times too
shallow; the characters were often
arranged in a straight line in front
of the footlights, leaving the back
of the stage completely, and too
obviously, empty.
Dr. David Harris, assistant pro
fessor of history, made a smooth
and dastardly villain. He showed
great stage poise and displayed
much talent in his characterization.
Robert Dwan, as the radical youth
whose activities have left him a
physical and nervous wreck, was
most convincing. His "jitters" had
the audience on edge. Tom Sellers,
another Stanfordite, was satisfying
in a small part.
Limited space prohibits us from
commending all but a few of the
talented off-campus cast. Augusta
Harrold and Clifford Giffin were
outstanding as "Juno" Boyle and
"Captain" Boyle, and Dorothy Anne
Henderson played their daughter,
"Mary," with an excellently af
fected naivete. The idling drunk,
"Joxer," was made most comical by
Jack Neifing, although at times he
overplayed his lines beyond their
importance. The set, representing a
small Irish apartment, was very!
effective.
