# MAUGHAM PLAY RECITATION SET FOR TOMORROW
## Constant Wife' To Be Read By Sword and Sandals In Little Theatre 
### 
To Somerset Maugham's sparkling
lines will be added the comedy abil
ity of Sword and Sandals' group of
able actors when "The Constant
Wife" is presented at 7:30 tomor
row evening in the Little Theatre.
"The Constant Wife" is the type of
drawing room comedy which eager
campus audiences have been im
portuning Sword and Sandals to
present. Its gay humor should keep
its hearers chuckling.
Kilby Takes Lead
Harrictte Hall Kilby plays Con
stance, "The Constant Wife." Waldo
Salt takes the role of her unfaithful
husband. She overlooks his infi
delity as long as possible, then re
duces him to helpless ire by running
off with the man she almost mar
ried, promising, however, to return
in six weeks.
To the bare plot of the story
Maugham has added the sophisti
cated brilliance which those who saw
Sword and Sandals' production of
his "The Circle" last summer will
remember. Maugham is acknowl
edged as one of the best of con
temporary writers of comedy, rank
ing with Noel Coward, Rachel
Crothers, and others.
