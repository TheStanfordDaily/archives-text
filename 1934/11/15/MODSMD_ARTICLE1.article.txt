# Plan to Quit Game Broadcasting Finds Campus Sympathy
## Radio May Be Detrimental To Sale of Tickets, Is Opinion of Many 
### 
The statement of Graduate Man
ager A1 Masters yesterday that
broadcasts of football games should
be done away with because of their
detrimental effect on game attend
ances has found an echo of sym
pathy on the campus.
That Masters is justified in making
his accusation against football broad
casts apparently is the general opin
ion of faculty and students alike,
an investigation today revealed.
William B. Owens, faculty repre
sentative on the Pacific Coast In
tercollegiate Athletic Conference,
and member of the 8.A.C., made the
statement: "If the ticket sales are
falling off to such an extent that the
athletic program of the University
is endangered by the decreased in
come, 1 certainly would be in favor
of taking game broadcasts off the
air."
Will Propose Plan
Masters plans to propose his plan
at the next meeting of the Coast
Conference and evidently will have
Owens on his side.
Chuck White, student member of
the 8.A.C., indicated that no men
tion of the effect of broadcasts on
games had yet been made in B.A.C.
meetings.
"However,' he stated, "the BA.C.
deserves a good income because of
the good it does the University in
paying for building, etc., and if the
broadcasts are hurting that income
1 think they should be done away
with for a while at least."
Marvie Kahn, B.A.C. member and
A.S.S.U. president, also favors Mas
ters' proposal, saying: "I think it
would be a good thing to try doing
away with the broadcasts for a sea
son and if the attendances pick up
it would prove that the radio really
does hurt football incomes."
"All or None," Says Owens
Coast Conference member Owens
believes that a policy of "all or none"
would have to be adopted if broad
casts were to be banished at all.
He does not think it would be fair
for some games to be broadcast and
others not.
The belief of Masters is that at
tendances at Stanford games should
have been larger this year than last
with a better home schedule and a
championship team. The fact that
they were not he blames on the
broadcasts.
"Most people," Masters said,
"would rather sit home and listen
to the radio than sit in seats behind
the end zones. Naturally if there
were no broadcasts they would be
more inclined to come to the games.
Masters does not believe that the
broadcasts are the only factor in
keeping down ticket sales, but docs
think that they are the chief one.

Marvie Kahn, B.A.C. member and
A.S.S.U. president, also favors Mas
ters' proposal, saying: "I think it
would be a good thing to try doing
away with the broadcasts for a sea
son and if the attendances pick up
it would prove that the radio really
does hurt football incomes."
"All or None," Says Owens
Coast Conference member Owens
believes that a policy of "all or none"
would have to be adopted if broad
casts were to be banished at all.
He does not think it would be fair
for some games to be broadcast and
others not.
The belief of Masters is that at
tendances at Stanford games should
have been larger this year than last
with a better home schedule and a
championship team. The fact that
they were not he blames on the
broadcasts.
"Most people," Masters said,
"would rather sit home and listen
to the radio than sit in seats behind
the end zones. Naturally if there
were no broadcasts they would be
more inclined to come to the games.
Masters does not believe that the
broadcasts are the only factor in
keeping down ticket sales, but docs
think that they are the chief one.
The statement of Graduate Man
ager A1 Masters yesterday that
broadcasts of football games should
be done away with because of their
detrimental effect on game attend
ances has found an echo of sym
pathy on the campus.
That Masters is justified in making
his accusation against football broad
casts apparently is the general opin
ion of faculty and students alike,
an investigation today revealed.
William B. Owens, faculty repre
sentative on the Pacific Coast In
tercollegiate Athletic Conference,
and member of the 8.A.C., made the
statement: "If the ticket sales are
falling off to such an extent that the
athletic program of the University
is endangered by the decreased in
come, 1 certainly would be in favor
of taking game broadcasts off the
air."
Will Propose Plan
Masters plans to propose his plan
at the next meeting of the Coast
Conference and evidently will have
Owens on his side.
Chuck White, student member of
the 8.A.C., indicated that no men
tion of the effect of broadcasts on
games had yet been made in B.A.C.
meetings.
"However,' he stated, "the BA.C.
deserves a good income because of
the good it does the University in
paying for building, etc., and if the
broadcasts are hurting that income
1 think they should be done away
with for a while at least."
