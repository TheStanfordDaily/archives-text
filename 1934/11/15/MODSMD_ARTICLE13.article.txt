# READERS WILL GIVE MAUGHAM DRAMA TONIGHT
## Kilby, Salt, and Bowman Fill Leading Roles Of "Constant Wife" 
### 
"The Constant Wife," Somerset
Maugham's brilliant drawing room
comedy, will be presented by Sword
and Sandals in the Little Theatre
tonight at 7:30 o'clock.
In producing the Maugham play.
Sword and Sandals is returning to
the popular type of presentation
which won it so much acclaim last
year. Last year's audiences will re
member "Let 'Em Eat Cake," "On the
Rocks," and other brilliant comedies
which delighted the campus.
"The Constant Wife" is the story
of a woman who overlooks her hus
band's infidelity as long as possible,
then runs off with a former suitor,
promising, however, to return to her
husband in six weeks. The humor
of the play lies not so much in its
plot, as in its witty and sophisticated
lines. Maugham takes the opportu
nity to indulge in some pungent
thrusts at women and marriage.
The leading roles in this evening's
readings are played by Harriette
Hall Kilby as Constance, "The Con
stant Wife,", and Waldo Salt as John,
her unfaithful husband. Fritizi-Beth
Bowman takes the part of Marie-
Louise, the other woman; and George
Woods is Bernard Kersal, the other
man. Rosemary Benet as Mrs. Cul
ver, and Isobel Devlin as Martha,
are Constance's mother and sister,
respectively. Katherine Comrie takes
the role of Barbara, an old friend;
Joe Lawry plays Mortimer Durham;
and David Hughes is Bentley, the
butler. Paul Crary is directing and
reading stage directions.
Because of the great popularity of
Sword and Sandals readings, the
Little Theatre is usually crowded
beyond capacity; so everyone is
urged to come early in order to get a
good seat.
.No admission will be charged.
