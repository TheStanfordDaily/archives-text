# ALASKAN BISHOP TO TALK SUNDAY
## Bishop Rowe Has 38 Years Experience in North 
### 
The Right Reverend Peter Trimble )
Rowe will give the sermon Sunday j
morning in the Memorial Chapel.
Bishop Rowe has been for 38 years
head of the Territory of Alaska
Episcopate.
Seventy-six years old, he hasj
"mushed" countless miles on snow- I
shoes behind dog teams in the most i
severe of winter weather, and has J
cruised all of the navigable rivers in |
his famous launch, "The Pelican." i
Two years ago, however, heeding ;
the forward march of progress, he ;
appropriated an airplane, and now
does the greater part of his mission- '
ary work via the airlanes.
Made famous by his writer- j
friends, Jack London and Rex Beach, j
he has come to be a veritable |
patriarch of Alaska, the most be- |
loved man in the territory, and the j
most interested in its social wel- 1
fare.
Rovers, trappers, whalers, pros
pectors, store keepers, lumberjacks,!
natives, and sailors are all sworn |
friends of the bishop. He partici- j
pated in all the great gold rushes, |
but never carried an ounce of the j
metal away, always building church- j
es, schools, and hospitals.
He has sturdily gone on his way, |
preaching the Gospel of Christian- |
ity with earnestness and fervor, but I
always with human, practical sym- ;
pathy for his fellows in whatever'
conditions he encountered them. j
