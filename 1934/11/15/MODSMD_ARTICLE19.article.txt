# Interfraternity Council Changes Rushing Dates
## 
### 
The dates for the next rushing pe- ;
riod have been changed to Tuesday |
and Thursday of next week by de- j
cision of the Interfraternity Council ;
at its meeting last night. The bon- j
fire, coming as it does on November j
22, interfered with the date as pre- |
viously announced and made the i
change necessary.
Fourteen freshmen pledges is the
definite limit any house may have. |
Any additional pledges must be se- i
cured during spring quarter, but j
may not be taken from the class of |
'38. Only this year's sophomores and
upperclassmen may be in excess ol i
14.
The council also decided to send j
a delegate to the National Interfra- i
ternity Council's conference which is I
held in New York next month.
