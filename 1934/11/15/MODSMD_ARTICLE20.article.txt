# Kahn Asks Support of Game Pyre
## Class Presidents Pledge Student Co-operation 
### 
While the four class presidents
have pledged the full support of
their respective classes for the Big
Game bonfire to be built next Wed
nesday, A.S.S.U. President Marvin
Kahn yesterday called on the stu
dent body to prove the overwhelm
ing fire program support which was
so enthusiastically shown in the
vote last month.
Kahn in his statement remarked:
"It seems to me that the response of
the student body hasn't been com
parable to its feeling as indicated in
the recent bonfire election. If we are
the type of student body that stands
behind its convictions, we should
feel our duty to do our just share of
the work.
Co-operation Asked
"The bonfire committeemen have
laid good plans and have devised an
efficient manner of building the pyre.
All they ask is that you build your
own fire. That isn't asking too much.
We have the manpower and all we
have to do is demonstrate our will
power."
The junior class, which built the
last bonfire, is represented by its
president, Claude Calloway, who
says that "the sentiment of the
class of '36 strongly favors the fire
and members in both the Row and
the Halls will give their heartiest
support."
Bob Hoover, president of the only
class which has not yet participated
in the building of a bonfire, the class
of '37, states, "The sophomores last
year opposed the fire, but since it
is to be an all-University affair this
year, the sentiment has changed to
one of extreme favor."
Burn Coffin
Sequoia hall has displayed keen
interest in the event and will carry
on a tradition started several years
ago. Just before the bonfire is ig
nited, a coffin will be carried to the
scene by a guard armed with axes
imitating the traditional Big Game
Axe. The coffin will be placed on the
top of the pyre, immediately after
which the fire will be lighted.
The freshmen demonstrated their
enthusiasm for the bonfire Tuesday
night at a short meeting of Encina
Club. Hours of work were listed for
all frosh.
