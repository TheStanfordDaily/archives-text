# David, Lamson Leaves Prison For San Jose
## District Attorney Thomas Refuses To Confirm Retrial Rumors 
### 
SAN QUENTIN PRISON, Nov. 14
(A 3 ). -David Lamson walked out of
prison fr re at 4 p.m. today to be
returned to Santa Clara County
jurisdiction where officials said he
' probably" will be tried once again
on charges of having murdered his
wife.
"I'm so happy I don't care what
happens now," Lamson smiled as he
wa.s taken from his cell an hour and
a half previous to await the arrival
of Sheriff W. 11. Emig of San Jose
with transfer papers.
He shielded himself from a
heavy downpour of rain and posed
freely for photographers while wait
ing for Emig. San Quentin's death
row has been Lamson's home for 14
months since his conviction.
"Hallo, boys," he greeted the group
in the prison offices. He was dressed
in a natfy brown tweed suit and was
clean shaven.
"Wait here, Dave," Warden
James B. Holohan said, leading Lam
son to the warden's office. He loft
Lamson alone after handing him
several letters.
With Emig was Deputy Sheriff
Felix Cordrey. When they departed
in their automobile, Cordrey drove
and Emig sat in the rear seat with
Lamson.
The Santa Clara district attor
ney's office has been studying the
case closely since the state supreme
court a month ago reversed Lam
son's conviction in the murder of his
wife, Allene, who was found dead in
the bathtub of their Stanford Uni
versity campus home.
However, District Attorney Fred
C. Thomas, although reiterating
several times there "probably" would
be a re-trial, has never definitely
announced the fact.
