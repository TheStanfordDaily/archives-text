# F.R. Outlines Social Plan
## 
### 
WASHINGTON. Nov. 14 (/P).â€”
The broad outlines of a social se
curity plan, definitely incorporating
unemployment insurance as a part
of the next congressional program,
were sketched today by President
Roosevelt and turned over to a
group of experts for refining.
The immediate objectives of the
program the President has decided
upon were:
Unemployment insurance of a co
operative federal - state form; the
funds to be held and invested by the
federal government; the benefits to
be administered by the states.
Enactment of state laws to carry
out such a program.
An effort to bring the persons now
on relief rolls back into productive
employment and thereby put them
under the insurance system.
From a long range standpoint, he
proposed:
A uniform system to provide se
curity for the aged.
A method, perhaps through in
surance, for providing against the
economic loss due to sickness.
In a brief tulk, the President out
lined these objectives to his com
mit toe on economic security and its
newly created advisory council. He
turned over to' them- the job of
shaping into a weapon for a "bold
stroke' toward economic security
the hundreds of proposals that had
been presented during an all-day
session.
