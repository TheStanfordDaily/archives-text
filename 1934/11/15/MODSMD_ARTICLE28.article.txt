# The 						Winds of Freedom, And Don't Be Un-American

Now Unit lour oul of the five students origi
nally suspended from the University of Cali
fornia ;il Los Angeles for alleged "Communis
tic" activities have been reinstated on the
West wood campus, there are two or three
items worthy of mention.
Final investigation found that the charges
:is originally made were not upheld, that the
students were guilty of insubordination and
nothing further, Provost Moore and President
Sproul concurring in the decision. It is, natu
rally, unfortunate that the whole mess took
place, it is fortunate that the "head man"
in I his show is the type of a university presi
dent who wants to learn the facts before he
ads, who desires to understand his students,
to work with them, not against them, to do
what he believes is right regardless of prece
dent.

In the meantime, the situation at t'.C.L.A.
brought forth a peculiar set of circumstances
elsewhere. "Red" scares timed forth at many
institutions, and authorities found themselves
in the headlines as they announced their firm
stand against "Communistic activities" to
their students.
The following, we find, is a pledge that all
students at San Jose Stale College (and other
Slate colleges) are required to sign:
/ pledge myself, without reservation, to
obey, support, and respect the Constitution
unit laws of the I'nited St (ties. I pledge my
self to refrain from negatively or positively
advocating the use of methods not sanc
tioned by the Constitution and laws of the
I nited States to effect the modification or
replacement of the form of government of
the I'nited States.
Now. the above "pledge" is perhaps not un
reasonable to oiler a law-abiding citizen. It
does not ask anything that any one of us
would not heartily endorse. But, if we are
men and not mere babes, if we are students in
a university and not children to be watched
at every step—does that same pledge do any
more than raise antagonism to every single
thing that is "American" about our physical
and mental makeup?
Every single thought that the above quo
tation demands is nothing more than that
which we must necessarily do in order to
avoid being slapped in the nearest cooler for
action to the contrary. If we do not obey the
Constitution and the laws of the United States,
tlie police courts are very happy to tell us what
to do.
But, when we are told that to attend a State
college, we must sign a mere statement of
I'acl thai rankles the more because we would
much rather be proud of the doing on our
own free will — the question is a different
mailer.
