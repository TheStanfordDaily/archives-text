# This Broadcasting Proposition

Thai "King" Football is developing Fran
kenstcinian tendencies and threatening to
master ils makers has long been the major
premise owned by critics of the colleges.
There is more than a suspicion of doubt ex
isting as to whether Ihe complicated and
cumbersome machine is running the men or
Ihe men are running the machine; and this
doubt is substantiated by the confusion with
which football executives confront their prob
lems,
AI Musters of Stanford and liill Monahan
ol California are two of the more enlightened
men in the football "business." Thev are wor
ried no end over the radio broadcasting of
games, and suggest that the Coast Conference
ought to bar the radio men from Ihe stadium
for a trial period to lest the validity of their
own belief that attendance would thereupon
increase.
On ils face radio broadcasting of football
appears to be a legitimate reporting of the
news, an exciter of :i public following, and a
mighty force in Ihe building of good will
toward the teams. Opponents of the practice
should weigh considerations carefully before
they trilie with a hard-earned good will which,
although its tangible value is hard to appre
hend, is an actual, existing, growing force.
Further, supposing the independent teams
of the Pacific Coast, St. Mary's, Santa Clara,
S.l'M'., and others, continue broadcasts, are
I hey not going to reap extra dividends in pub
lic esteem? V. ill there not be a possibility

that fans who stay at home and follow the
independent teams play by play will not,
when they can afford it, continue to follow
those teams for a top price of *I.(>."> per head
in Kezar Stadium?
The decrease in Stanford and California
yearly gates is not because of radio, nor be
cause of lapse of gridiron interest. There are
simply too many football teams playing good
football; and too many competing interests
reaching for Mr. John Q. Fan's diminishing
weekly wage. And since the autumn of
perhaps a good many citizens have discovered
refined appreciation of values.
