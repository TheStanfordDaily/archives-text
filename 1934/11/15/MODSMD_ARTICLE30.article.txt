# Sword and Sandals
## 
### 
Evidence that some honor societies can
and do justify their right to existence is of
fered tonight by Sword and Sandals. Somerset
Maugham's comedy "The Constant Wile"
will be presented as a reading by this men's
drama organization without any charge for
admission, as is customary.
Sword and Sandals' readings are nothing
new to the campus. The entertainment and
dramatic value of their productions have been
familiar to Stanford audiences for several
years. In fact they have come to be taken
pretty much for granted.
Therefore, it is all the more striking when
we contrast the useful activities of Sword and
Sandals with the useless desuetude of the
average honor society which releases a pledge
list once a year and then is forgotten. In fact,
except for collecting dues and initiation fees,
which it never forgets, the average honor
society is usually unconscious of its own ex
istence for the balance of the year. A pledge
list, a financial report, and thenâ€”silence.
Sword and Sandals is to be congratulated
for its active and consistent efforts to bring
worthwhile plays to campus audiences. And
likewise it is to be congratulated, for giving
the students a basis for comparing useful and
useless honor societies. The inference is clear.
The former are worthwhile additions to cam
pus life; the latter can be dispensed with.
