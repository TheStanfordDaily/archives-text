Last Monday troubled German peoples raised sur
prised eyes to another radical announcement from Nazi
headquarters. But this time they did more than shake
their heads in submission. Feeling ran high as the
Danzig municipal office announced that the "slightly
feeble-minded" were to be included in the Nazi sterili
zation program.
For some time the relatively small part of the
German population classified as habitual criminals
and the insane have been subjected to sterilization.
This practice was generally approved. But the "slightly
feeble-minded" is bound to include a big group, and
the Nazis are going to have to fight more than just
the Catholic church in enforcing their new program.
Maud Amanda Merrill, associate professor of psy
chology, is inclined to agree with the present general
German feeling that Hitler's government is taking on
more than it can handle in this particular step for
the elimination of future generations of physically
and mentally unfit.
"To distinguish between a feeble-minded person
and one who is merely of low grade intelligence is
biologically difficult and if a German Reich committee,
for example, should undertake the job on a large
scale, it could hardly be expected to be efficient and
accurate," Dr. Merrill stated.
"Whereever sterilization has been tried in the
United States, however, it has been successful. No
better example can be found than right here in the
state of California where sterilization in institutions
for the mentally deficient is practiced on a larger
scale than in any other state in the union."
Dr. Merrill cited the state law which provides that
any insane or feeble-minded person can be sterilized
if the authorities obtain the consent of the patient
and his guardians. Since 1909, 4423 persons have been
treated in this state with surprisingly good results. A
reasonable indication of success is shown by the fact
that about two-thirds of those treated and placed on
parole have been able to conquer the difficulties
which made it necessary for their first confinement.
Information in Dr. Merrill's records showed that
of three-fourths of feeble-minded girls who were sex
delinquents before sterilization, only 12 per cent
continued delinquent after sterilization. The improve
ment is due to the institutions' training, however, not
to the operations.
"In other stales there have been similarly success
ful records made," said Dr. Merrill. "And for all we
know Germany may be merely taking up our methods
on a large scale. The difficulty will arise in Ihe large
scale practice."
Truly commendable is the obvious pul7lo.se of this
"insanity purge." Hitler wants a greater German
nation of the most superior class of individuals. Two
weeks ago he passed a law providing large income tax
exemptions to families who had children. The higher
class of families with the highest incomes would
benefit by this law the most and thus it is ihe upper
class that is encouraged most in child rearing. Now
Hitler intends to make impotent the whole of the
lowest level of German society.
There is no madness in the Nazi purpose. It if; in
the wholesale methods Ihut the danger lies.

zation program.
For some time the relatively small part of the
German population classified as habitual criminals
and the insane have been subjected to sterilization.
This practice was generally approved. But the "slightly
feeble-minded" is bound to include a big group, and
the Nazis are going to have to fight more than just
the Catholic church in enforcing their new program.
Maud Amanda Merrill, associate professor of psy
chology, is inclined to agree with the present general
German feeling that Hitler's government is taking on
more than it can handle in this particular step for
the elimination of future generations of physically
and mentally unfit.
"To distinguish between a feeble-minded person
and one who is merely of low grade intelligence is
biologically difficult and if a German Reich committee,
for example, should undertake the job on a large
scale, it could hardly be expected to be efficient and
accurate," Dr. Merrill stated.
"Whereever sterilization has been tried in the
United States, however, it has been successful. No
better example can be found than right here in the
state of California where sterilization in institutions
for the mentally deficient is practiced on a larger
scale than in any other state in the union."
Dr. Merrill cited the state law which provides that
any insane or feeble-minded person can be sterilized
if the authorities obtain the consent of the patient
and his guardians. Since 1909, 4423 persons have been
treated in this state with surprisingly good results. A
reasonable indication of success is shown by the fact
that about two-thirds of those treated and placed on
parole have been able to conquer the difficulties
which made it necessary for their first confinement.
Information in Dr. Merrill's records showed that
of three-fourths of feeble-minded girls who were sex
delinquents before sterilization, only 12 per cent
continued delinquent after sterilization. The improve
ment is due to the institutions' training, however, not
to the operations.
"In other stales there have been similarly success
ful records made," said Dr. Merrill. "And for all we
know Germany may be merely taking up our methods
on a large scale. The difficulty will arise in Ihe large
scale practice."
Truly commendable is the obvious pul7lo.se of this
"insanity purge." Hitler wants a greater German
nation of the most superior class of individuals. Two
weeks ago he passed a law providing large income tax
exemptions to families who had children. The higher
class of families with the highest incomes would
benefit by this law the most and thus it is ihe upper
class that is encouraged most in child rearing. Now
Hitler intends to make impotent the whole of the
lowest level of German society.
There is no madness in the Nazi purpose. It if; in
the wholesale methods Ihut the danger lies.
Last Monday troubled German peoples raised sur
prised eyes to another radical announcement from Nazi
headquarters. But this time they did more than shake
their heads in submission. Feeling ran high as the
Danzig municipal office announced that the "slightly
feeble-minded" were to be included in the Nazi sterili
zation program.
