# BULL SESSION
## 
### 
The world, besides being faced
with the Ihreat of another war, is
faced with the more immediate
threat of another conference. The
war may come, or may be long de
layed; but. as surely as small acorns
fall from big oaks, there will be an
other world conference.
Like American business, confer
ences are fundamentally sound.
But apparently there are enough
unsound things that are not fun
damentals, that business and con
ferences are left in rather bad shape.
Fundamentally, it is a grand idea to
get together and talk things over.
Seeing eye to eye, sitting shoulder
to shoulder, breathing the same air
—all that is good. But when the
eyes are bloodshot, the shoulders
uncomfortably bony, and the air
polluted—all is not well in Geneva.
If conferences were frankly ac
knowledged to be merely gab
fests, they would still be all right.
Yet every conference today is bally
hooed as the one thing that will save
the world from complete ruin. And
when almost every conference fails,
and the world is still not completely
ruined, it is no wonder that some
should look at conferences rather
forlornly.
The Student Institute of Pacific
Relations has grappled with this
situation and conquered it. For the
past eight years it has been holding
conferences of its own. They are
not world conferences, nor world
saving conferences. They are simply
bull sessions on affairs of the Pa
cific nations.
Each Thanksgiving vacation a
small group of interested students
from Coast univei'sities gather high
in the seclusion of the mountains
to talk themselves out. There, far
removed from the jingoism and heat
which infest conference atmosphere
generally, they attempt intelligent
discussion of problems of war, re
ligion, and politics. There are never
startling results. The gains are in
those intangibles that ARE import
ant.
Stanford students who think that
important things CAN happen be
yond the Sandstone Gates are in
vited. Those who go will find not
ballyhoo, but stimulating discussion.
World conferences set out to do big
things, and fail. The Student In
stitute's Conference will not fail.

with the Ihreat of another war, is
faced with the more immediate
threat of another conference. The
war may come, or may be long de
layed; but. as surely as small acorns
fall from big oaks, there will be an
other world conference.
Like American business, confer
ences are fundamentally sound.
But apparently there are enough
unsound things that are not fun
damentals, that business and con
ferences are left in rather bad shape.
Fundamentally, it is a grand idea to
get together and talk things over.
Seeing eye to eye, sitting shoulder
to shoulder, breathing the same air
—all that is good. But when the
eyes are bloodshot, the shoulders
uncomfortably bony, and the air
polluted—all is not well in Geneva.
If conferences were frankly ac
knowledged to be merely gab
fests, they would still be all right.
Yet every conference today is bally
hooed as the one thing that will save
the world from complete ruin. And
when almost every conference fails,
and the world is still not completely
ruined, it is no wonder that some
should look at conferences rather
forlornly.
The Student Institute of Pacific
Relations has grappled with this
situation and conquered it. For the
past eight years it has been holding
conferences of its own. They are
not world conferences, nor world
saving conferences. They are simply
bull sessions on affairs of the Pa
cific nations.
Each Thanksgiving vacation a
small group of interested students
from Coast univei'sities gather high
in the seclusion of the mountains
to talk themselves out. There, far
removed from the jingoism and heat
which infest conference atmosphere
generally, they attempt intelligent
discussion of problems of war, re
ligion, and politics. There are never
startling results. The gains are in
those intangibles that ARE import
ant.
Stanford students who think that
important things CAN happen be
yond the Sandstone Gates are in
vited. Those who go will find not
ballyhoo, but stimulating discussion.
World conferences set out to do big
things, and fail. The Student In
stitute's Conference will not fail.
