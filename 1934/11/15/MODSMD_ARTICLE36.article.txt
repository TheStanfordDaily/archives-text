NEW FRONTIERS," by llenry A.
Wallace. Reynald & Hitchcock, j
New York, 1934
Secretary of Agriculture Henry A. !
Wallace in this volume just off the j
press seeks to expound the philoso
phy and objectives of the New Deal. I
The book is something of a Demo
cratic reply to Herbert Hoover's
"The Challenge to Liberty."
The volume is too all-embracive. I
The author discusses private own
ership, tariff, propaganda, monetary
policy, agriculture, and political
philosophy.
One feels that if Secretary Wallace j
had limited himself to delineating!
the new frontiers of agriculture!
alone, he would have achieved a
more successful job. In justice to j
the writer, however, be it said that j
the sections of the volume devoted 1
to agriculture are well done.
"Farmers have probably been
more active than any other group in
searching for economic democracy," j
states the author.
Secretary Wallace finds the 1934
droughts a severe handicap to the
Agricultural Adjustment Admin
istration. "The drought created a;
new and gigantic relief problem; it
compelled the AAA to face a situa
tion in 1935 it did not expect to face
until 1936 at the earliest."
"Working with the capitalistic or- !
der as it has come to us out of ;
the past," concludes Wallace, "we !
can develop policies which will en
able the representatives of agricul
ture, labor, industry, and consumers !
to meet together more effectively I
than in the past, and discover just j
formulae for price and production
policies. The government sits in j
either as a party to the negotiations ;
or as a reviewer and enforcer."
