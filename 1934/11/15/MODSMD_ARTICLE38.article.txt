I "MARIE (IALANTE"
At the Stanford Tht aire
"Marie Galante," the picture that
has aroused international disap
! proval, offers the very :n:u.-.u»l com
j binatioji of a remarkable plot and a
! convincing cast. The story, sot in

Pana m a , r s -
volves a round
Ihe intrigue of
foreign agents
who arc sta
tioned in the
Canal Zone.
Ketti Galiian,
ins,' from her

j native France, plays the role of
| Marie, a naive French girl who be
j comes a pawn in the international
; game. Gallian, although of the
Dietrich type, acts with greater
i finesse and a less flagrant display of
, sex appeal than does Marlon:-.
Spencer Tracy iri the role of a
| United States agent gives an un-
I usually forcible performance, wane
Helen Morgan and Stepin Fechii'

.supply the lighter type of enter
tainment. —Hicks.
