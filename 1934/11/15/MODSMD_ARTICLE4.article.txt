# Cast Shows Versatility In Drama
## Varying Moods Feature Thornton's Acting 
### 
Light, youthful slapdash and deep,
j serious moods characterized William
i Thornton's Shakespearean players
who presented "The Taming of the
Shrew" and "King Lear" in the As
sembly Hall yesterday.
The young troupe kicked up their
heels with merry delight in the af
ternoon comedy, and settled down
into an intense, dramatic stride in
"King Lear."
William Thor.nton, portraying the
swashbuckling Petruchio, who sub
| dues haughty, imperious Katherina
j (Mary Mar land), rendered his lines
| effortlessly and smoothly while wav-
I ing his arms in great glee and strid
; ing heartily about the stage.
As Lear, mad king of Britain, his
j ability is more fully shown than in
the light comedy, which revealed
] the agility and delightfully unex
j pected wild scrambles of the actors.
The costumes and settings were
| quite remarkable in their authen
; ticity and appropriateness. The last
j scene of "The Taming of the Shrew,"
! which revealed lovely gowns and
| sumptuous settings, was greeted with
; applause by a highly appreciative
j audience.
j In the early scenes of both plays,
| the actors were a little diffident and
j un-co-ordinatcd, but this fault was
{ soon remedied.
Charles Hurtgen, as Grumio, a
i servant of Petruchio's, captivated the
I audience by his elf-like, merry ac
tions, although the Stanford stage
was too small for his and his mas- j
ter's wild dashes.
King Lear Sad Drama
"King Lear," sad, somber, and!
emotional, shows the histrionic abil- !
ity of the entire cast. In some places, |
notably the second scene of Act I, :
I the action drags a little and a too
| high emotional pitch is reached.
The third scene of that same act
j was very convincing; a deep feeling
j of pity and sorrow was created for j
! old King Lear, whose creaking, quer- |
I ulous voice expressed his puzzle-1
ment and doubt as to his own wis
j dom in the treatment of his daugh- j
| ters.
