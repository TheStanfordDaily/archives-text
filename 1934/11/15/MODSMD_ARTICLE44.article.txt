# FARM SCHOLARS AT ORIENTAL COLLEGE TELL EXPERIENCES
## 
### 
Two Stanford undergraduates,
William C. Kuzell of Clarksdale,
Arizona, and William A. Mingst, of
San Francisco, were the recipients
of two of the twelve scholarships
for American students now offered
annually by the Lingnan University
at Canton, China.
First word of their initial expe
riences has just been received:
"Canton is three hours' journey
from Hongkong on the railroad, and
is situated on the Pearl River,"
writes Kuzell. "Lingnan is situated
on a large island in the river about
three miles from the center of the
city. We have to go back and forth
either in sampans, rowed by two
women, or by launch.
"The campus covers some 560
acres and is a veritable garden spot.
The buildings are of a blended type
of architecture â€” semi - European,
semi-Chinese. There is a primary
school, a middle-school, and the Uni
versity. In the colleges there are
about 450 students. Most of the
courses are given in English."
"I room with a fellow named Lau
Chi Wing, who is a fine feilow. We
all have Chinese room-mates, and we
eat Chinese food for lunch and din
ner every day."
Professors are Chinese, but all of
them hold bachelor's degrees from
California, and many of them ad
vanced degrees from Cornell and
Columbia. Kuzell complains that
his organic chemistry teacher "has
the particularly annoying habit of
running absent-mindedly off into
Chinese in the middle of a difficult
explanation."
There is a Stanford club in Can
ton, Kuzell states, which has about
28 members. Mingst and he attended
meetings regularly.
