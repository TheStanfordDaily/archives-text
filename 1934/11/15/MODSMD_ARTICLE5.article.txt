### 
PARKER, Ariz., Nov. 14 (JP).â€”
Major F. I. Pomeroy, commander of
Arizona's National Guard forces,
said the troops including the original
detachment would move from the
Parker area about three o'clock this
afternoon.
His announcement followed orders
from Adjutant General Oscar Tempo
by radio. One company was ordered
back to Prescott and the rest of the
detachment, including equipment
from Flagstaff, direct to Phoenix.
The guardsmen likely will beat
their post cards back home.
Ordered to Parker Dam site to
halt work on the Arizona side when
Governor Moeur proclaimed martial
law, the army learned upon its arri
val here its objective already had
been accomplished.
"If they had granted us only two
more days," said J. Perry Yates,
resident engineer, "wo would have
had the bridge completed and the
troops could have used it in reach
ing the martial law zone."
Construction was not suspended
on the California bank. Yates said
it could continue without serious
handicap for perhaps a month.
Unless the controversy is settled
within that time the entire project
might be suspended.
