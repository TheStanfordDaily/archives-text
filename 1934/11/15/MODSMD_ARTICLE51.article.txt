# Stanford Woman Attends Summer Labor Sessions
## 
### ERNESTINE MAGAGNA 
"We didn't have to go to classes;
there weren't any examinations; yet
everyone attended the classes and
everyone learned in them.
"We didn't talk about clothes or
dates or parties at the dinner table;
we talked about the strike, or labor
unions, or Professor J. J. Voorhis's
lecture.
"Classes were held on the lecture
plan, but the teachers were con
stantly being interrupted by students
who disagreed on some point. And
when the students disagreed they
really had some definite reason or
experience to back them up."
Collegians Attend
This is the description Josephine
Schlatter, Stanford student, gives of
the Western Summer School for In
dustrial Workers held last summer
at Occidental College, Los Angeles.
Eighty-three students attended.
Thirty-three were industrial work
ers, including domestic workers,
brick and tile workers, textile work
ers, and factory workers of all sorts;
forty-two were unemployed teach
ers interested in adult education and
economics; eight were college stu
dents selected by their schools to
attend the school.
The purpose of the school was "to
provide opportunity for workers in
industry to study the social and eco
nomic problems of present-day in
dustrial society, to train them in
clear thinking, and to develop a de
sire for study as a means of under
standing and enjoyment of life." It
also afforded contact between college
students, teachers, and workers.
Labor Popular
"Labor and economics taught by
Professor John L. Kerchen of the
University of California, and history
of the labor movement taught by
Professor H. J. Voorhis were the
most popular classes," according to
the Stanford representative.
"The industrial workers signed
up for two or perhaps three courses.
The college students went to what
they had time for, and they gen
erally managed to have tini2 for
many of them.
"In the afternoon we sat around
and discussed economic conditions,
strike technique, and labor prob

â€¢ lems. Many evenings we had open j
; foruro discussions led by some dis- j
j tinguished visiting speaker or some
! faculty member. The workers were
quite ready to talk and they are al
j ways interesting because of the
; actual experiences brought into
arguments.
To Meet Again
! "Then, too, we published a weekly
. newspper clled What Now. And
I at the end of the four weeks we
; edited a magazine called The Cru
| ?ader. A worker was at the head of
I the editorial staff, and anyone could
| submit articles."
There are only two other such
: schools existing. The Western Sum
mer School for Workers is the only
! one in the West. It will meet again I
I this summer probably on the campus I
j of some Northern California college.
