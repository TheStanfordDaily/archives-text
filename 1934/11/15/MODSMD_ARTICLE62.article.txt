# U.S. Drafts Plan For Licensing Armaments
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 13 (/P).â€”The
United States has initiated a new
world effort to control the munitions
traffic, submitting to other powers a
plan for strict governmental licens
ing of arms manufacturing as well as
sales, imports, and exports.
This move was disclosed today,
although draft articles of the plan
were held secret. They are based on
the 1925 arms control pact. This
agreement provided licensing .of
arms imports and exports. The chief
new feature of the present proposal
is the licensing of all manufacturing
of war munitions.
Hugh Wilson, American Minister
of Switzerland, under instructions
irom Secretary Hull, is now seeking
the support of the chief munitions
manufacturing nations. The goal is
to expedite the proposed protocol
through the next session of the
steering committee of the disarma
ment conference, and the confer
ence's committee on control of traffic
in arms.
