# Postoffice Department Renews War on Crime
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 14 (JP).â€”A
new attempt by the Postoffice De
partment to snare gangsters turned
gamblers was disclosed today.
Since repeal, Secretary Morgen
thau says, bootlegging lias ceased
to be a field for easy profits, so
former followers of that occupation
have turned to gambling.
Justice Department officials have
no jurisdiction over gambling. But
the Postoffice Department already
has begun the federal government's
latest anti-crime drive.
It is after those who use the mails
in the execution of their gambling
schemes. Already arrests have been
made in v New York, Chicago, St.
Louis, Memphis and Springfield,
Mass.
