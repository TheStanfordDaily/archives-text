# INDIAN, WINGED 'O' WATER POLO GAME TO BE SATURDAY
## 
### 
One of the greatest college teams
of all time will clash with the beat
of a long line of first-rate club sep- 1
tots when the varsity water polo i
outfits of Stanford and the Olympic 1
Club meet in Encinu pool at 1 o'clock !
Saturday afternoon.
Since the powerful clubmen are
threatening the Cards' lead in the
league standings, this contest will
either insure the title for Nort!
Thornton's men or put them in a
triple tie for first place with the
Olympians and the California Bears.
The result .should also establish
cither the Indians or the Winged
"O" paddlers as the outstanding
team of the Pacific Coast, if not of |
the country.
Coach Thornton rates the present

Stanford team as the best in Card
inal history. Captain Leo Cook,
Vlad Taranik, and Bob Foster com
prise an expert and high-scoring for
ward wall and are supported by
three guards and a foalie who are
about equally strong ia offensive and
in defensive play.
Bill Woodard, "Suds" Sutherland,
and Wally Wiget at guards, and Bob
Haslacher, goalie, have not only held
every opposing team to five goals or
less this season, but alto fed the ball
to the forwards enough so that Stan
ford has run up much higher
scores.
The Olympic Club has always been 1

known for its top-notch teams, hav
ing won the Senior National A.A.U.
championship in both 1920 and 1925.
Although the Winged "O" has not
been represented in this competition
for the past six years because of
finances, its aquatic teams placed
high many times before 1928, and
are considered stronger now than
they were then.
As a result of the recent bad
weather, Captain Cook has a cold
and a sore throat, and is not en
gaging in practice this week. He is
practically certain to start the game
Saturday, though, and should be up
to all-American par.

Bob Sutherland has also missed
recent workouts because of a cut
eye incurred in practice last week.
; Jimmy Benet will start in Suther
land's guard position, but Sutherland
should go in later in the game.
I Junior varsity teams of Stanfor 1
and the Olympic Club will tangle in
j the preliminary at 12 o'clock, with
[ the varsity tilt following an hour

about 1:30, in plenty of time for fans

been represented in this competition
for the past six years because of
finances, its aquatic teams placed
high many times before 1928, and
are considered stronger now than
they were then.
As a result of the recent bad
weather, Captain Cook has a cold
and a sore throat, and is not en
gaging in practice this week. He is
practically certain to start the game
Saturday, though, and should be up
to all-American par.

Bob Sutherland has also missed
recent workouts because of a cut
eye incurred in practice last week.
; Jimmy Benet will start in Suther
land's guard position, but Sutherland
should go in later in the game.
I Junior varsity teams of Stanfor 1
and the Olympic Club will tangle in
j the preliminary at 12 o'clock, with
[ the varsity tilt following an hour
later. The game will be over by
about 1:30, in plenty of time for fans
i to attend the Card-Olympic game.
One of the greatest college teams
of all time will clash with the beat
of a long line of first-rate club sep- 1
tots when the varsity water polo i
outfits of Stanford and the Olympic 1
Club meet in Encinu pool at 1 o'clock !
Saturday afternoon.
Since the powerful clubmen are
threatening the Cards' lead in the
league standings, this contest will
either insure the title for Nort!
Thornton's men or put them in a
triple tie for first place with the
Olympians and the California Bears.
The result .should also establish
cither the Indians or the Winged
"O" paddlers as the outstanding
team of the Pacific Coast, if not of |
the country.
Coach Thornton rates the present

Stanford team as the best in Card
inal history. Captain Leo Cook,
Vlad Taranik, and Bob Foster com
prise an expert and high-scoring for
ward wall and are supported by
three guards and a foalie who are
about equally strong ia offensive and
in defensive play.
Bill Woodard, "Suds" Sutherland,
and Wally Wiget at guards, and Bob
Haslacher, goalie, have not only held
every opposing team to five goals or
less this season, but alto fed the ball
to the forwards enough so that Stan
ford has run up much higher
scores.
The Olympic Club has always been 1

known for its top-notch teams, hav
ing won the Senior National A.A.U.
championship in both 1920 and 1925.
Although the Winged "O" has not
been represented in this competition
for the past six years because of
finances, its aquatic teams placed
high many times before 1928, and
are considered stronger now than
