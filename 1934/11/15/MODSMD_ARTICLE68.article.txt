# Big Red Machine Tunes Up for Club Tilt
## 'TINY RESORTS TO RUNNING PLAYS AS AIR ATTACK FAILS Winged 'O' Is No Set-up; Adams, Black, Hamilton Back in Uniform 
### 
WANTED: A passing attack.
Will pay as high as two good ball
carriers. See C. E. Thornhill,
Stanford varsity practice field.
It was too late to run this in the
classified section last night when
scrimmage closed for the Stanford
Indians.
The scrimmage was the first held
on the Cardinal field since the week
lief ore the TJ.C.L.A. game, and it may
be (he last until after the California
contest next week. A cloudy sky,
slight drizzle, and water-logged field
retarded the Red Machine as it
checked over connections, tightened
bolts, and generally tuned up for the
Olympic Ciub game Saturday.
Once again, as in nearly every
scrimmage this year, passing was
stressed, and once again, Thorn
bill probably will instruct his
team to remain on the ground
against (he Club, at least until it
has run up a score that wili per
mit "playing around."
That kind of score seems almost
improbable in the "breather"
Winged "O" game, however. The
clubmen have shown spurts of
strength in contests with Santa Clara
and the University of San Francisco,
and they may press the Indians more
than the' average citizen believes.
. Passes Fail
Stanford looked far from impres
sive with her flock of soaring foot
balls yesterday. A few of (he passes
connected for good gains, but more
often the wet, slippery projectile
fell into (he hands of third stringers,
who furnished the defense for the
Varsity's trial run.
The passing attack, understand, is
not high-schoolish, or even poor, but
il is far enough below the standard
set by the Cardinal running plays at
present, that it would be highly im
practical to consider using the air
]L<> any serious extent in the Big
Game, less than ten days away, with
out considerably more polishing.
Adams, Black Rack
From here, it appears tint Stan
ford will have every man in shape
for the Bear game. Woody Adams
and Bob Black, in the running guard
position, are both still bothered with
sprained ankles, but the tendons are
healing rapidly, and either or both
may see part time action against the
clubmen.
Bones Hamilton, in (he hospital
Tuesday with several bruises, was
back in uniform, but he did not take
part in the scrimmage. Bob Rey
nolds and Jack Walton did not re
port for practice, but no indications
of injuries from those sources were
forthcoming.
