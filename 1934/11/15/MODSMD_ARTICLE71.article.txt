CARDS HAVEN'T
AN OFFENSE—TOUGH
The remarks appearing in city pa
pers this week to the effect that
all Stanford has is a defense verge
just a bit on the ridiculous. It is
almost unnecessary to defend a
charge like that when Stanford has
scored some 162 points against the
best teams the Pacific Coast can
offer.
In the first place, 162 points are
not scored by a sensational de
fense alone. But, assuming that
every Stanford point could have
been made on a break, the result
of un-crackable defense, it is sig
nificant to note just how all of
those scores really were made.
The smallest number of points run
up by the Indians this season,
against the University of San Fran
cisco, were made by a straight 80-
yard power drive through the
toughest line, unless Stanford's is
tougher, on the Coast.
THEY HAVE SCORING
PUNCH THIS YEAR
All right, Stanford has no offense.
But, if that is the case, what have
(hose other Indian attacks of past
years, which fumbled on the goal
line, never could add the fourth
down or touchdown punch, been?
It has been very, rare indeed
(hat Stanford has approached an
enemy goal this year (hat the In
dians did not score a touchdown,
or at least attempt a place kick.
Those place kicks have been get
ting all of the comment concerning
Stanford's weak offense. Why should
a team with a good offense give up
on a drive by a feeble field goal at
tempt, the charges run. The defense
of that taunt is that with a kicker
like Monk Moscrip, the percentage
of successful kicks would be much
higher than a normal average of
touchdown passes.
TAKE NOTHIN'
FROM NOBODY
Stanford does not possess eleven
all-Coast football players; (hat is ob
viously impossible. But there is not
a man on the team that takes any
thing from any opponents the In
dians have met this year.
The closest the Cards came to giv
ing away in any department was in
the U.S.F. con(es(, when the Don
line outcharged Stanford through
more (han half of (he game. In spite
of this, however, Wes Muller and
Nels Larsen were not outclassed in
any sense of the word by Larry
Siemering, Don all-Coast center.
When Stanford met Oregon
State, Red Franklin of the Beav
ers. who has been claimed one of
the country's best halfbacks,
seemed quite ineffective, while
Messrs. Grayson. Alustiza, and
Hamilton romped at leisure.
Then against Washington, Larry
Rouble and Bob Black were every
bit as outstanding as "Very" Mucha,
great Husky guard, while Burl Buf
kin, northern claim to backfield dis
tinction, was stopped rather suddenly
time after time.
There are several reasons for this.
First of all, Stanford has shown
enough power to completely smother
any team, to say nothing of any one
or two men, whom she has met to
date. This naturally makes any all-
Coast stars whom the Indians are
particularly pointing for, seem quite
mild. But then, too, there are no
centers, guards, tackles, ends, or
backs on the coast who individually
are more than slightly beiter than
(he first eleven Stanford men.

like Monk Moscrip, the percentage
of successful kicks would be much
higher than a normal average of
touchdown passes.
TAKE NOTHIN'
FROM NOBODY
Stanford does not possess eleven
all-Coast football players; (hat is ob
viously impossible. But there is not
a man on the team that takes any
thing from any opponents the In
dians have met this year.
The closest the Cards came to giv
ing away in any department was in
the U.S.F. con(es(, when the Don
line outcharged Stanford through
more (han half of (he game. In spite
of this, however, Wes Muller and
Nels Larsen were not outclassed in
any sense of the word by Larry
Siemering, Don all-Coast center.
When Stanford met Oregon
State, Red Franklin of the Beav
ers. who has been claimed one of
the country's best halfbacks,
seemed quite ineffective, while
Messrs. Grayson. Alustiza, and
Hamilton romped at leisure.
Then against Washington, Larry
Rouble and Bob Black were every
bit as outstanding as "Very" Mucha,
great Husky guard, while Burl Buf
kin, northern claim to backfield dis
tinction, was stopped rather suddenly
time after time.
There are several reasons for this.
First of all, Stanford has shown
enough power to completely smother
any team, to say nothing of any one
or two men, whom she has met to
date. This naturally makes any all-
Coast stars whom the Indians are
particularly pointing for, seem quite
mild. But then, too, there are no
centers, guards, tackles, ends, or
backs on the coast who individually
are more than slightly beiter than
(he first eleven Stanford men.

CARDS HAVEN'T
AN OFFENSE—TOUGH
The remarks appearing in city pa
pers this week to the effect that
all Stanford has is a defense verge
just a bit on the ridiculous. It is
almost unnecessary to defend a
charge like that when Stanford has
scored some 162 points against the
best teams the Pacific Coast can
offer.
In the first place, 162 points are
not scored by a sensational de
fense alone. But, assuming that
every Stanford point could have
been made on a break, the result
of un-crackable defense, it is sig
nificant to note just how all of
those scores really were made.
The smallest number of points run
up by the Indians this season,
against the University of San Fran
cisco, were made by a straight 80-
yard power drive through the
toughest line, unless Stanford's is
tougher, on the Coast.
THEY HAVE SCORING
PUNCH THIS YEAR
All right, Stanford has no offense.
But, if that is the case, what have
(hose other Indian attacks of past
years, which fumbled on the goal
line, never could add the fourth
down or touchdown punch, been?
It has been very, rare indeed
(hat Stanford has approached an
enemy goal this year (hat the In
dians did not score a touchdown,
or at least attempt a place kick.
Those place kicks have been get
ting all of the comment concerning
Stanford's weak offense. Why should
a team with a good offense give up
on a drive by a feeble field goal at
tempt, the charges run. The defense
of that taunt is that with a kicker
like Monk Moscrip, the percentage
of successful kicks would be much
higher than a normal average of
touchdown passes.
