# WILLIS SUMS UP BRIDGE PARLEY
## Pier Foundation's Safety Is Controversy Point 
### 
Summing up and concluding his
I arguments on the relative safety of
! the south pier foundation of the
j Golden Gate Bridge, Dr. Bailey
I Willis, emeritus professor of geol
! ogy, submitted his final report to
! the building committee of the
| bridge Tuesday.
Dr. Willis, who says the south pier
foundations are being built on un
safe rock, is contradicted by Profes
sor Andrew C. Lawson of the Uni
versity of California, who claims the
rock is safe. Dr. Willis maintains
1 than sandstone underlies the ser
| pentine foundation rock at no great
depth, and that the pier foundations
should be built on this sandstone.
Professor Lawson holds that the
serpentine may go down for a thou
sand feet or more. Dr. Willis claims
that there is a fault between the
serpentine and the sandstone; Law
son denies that a fault exists in that
position. These questions could be
settled by drilling to a somewhat
greater depth than has yet been
Willis has recommended thai such
drilling be done before any further
work is pushed in constructing the
pier.
"The situation regarding the pier,"
says Dr. Willis, "may be summed up
in the following statement of facts:
The Golden Gate Bridge is the great
est bridge ever planned. It requires
the strongest steel and the firmest
concrete. Its foundation should be no
less strong.
"The foundation rock of the south
pier is weak—no one knows how
weak. Building the bridge in ig
norance is a hazardous experiment.
The people of San Francisco and the
northern counties will pay for it.
To safeguard their investment and
their lives, they should insist that
the bridge be built on a deeper
foundation—one that shall be safe."
