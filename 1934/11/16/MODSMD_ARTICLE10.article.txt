# Women Help On Bonfire
## 
### 
As the date of the Big Game Bon
fire draws rapidly nearer, interest
grows correspondingly higher
toward the high goal set by bonfire
committeemen.
The women have taken a great
interest and are rapidly planning
their part of the program. Lunch
will be served to all workers by 20
freshmen women who will work in
shifts. Sandwiches, cookies, and
perhaps ice cream will be furnished
by the different sororities and halls,
according to Barbara Holmes, head
oi the Roble committee.
Although enthusiasm is rising
slowly among the freshmen, con
tacts made last night indicated that
the next few days will sec a steady
rise in interest, states Jack Loupe.
Fraternities and halls which have
been contacted have indicated by
their consistent signing for hours of
work during the "big day" that little
spurring on need be done.
Next Tuesday night at 7:15 an all-
University smoker will be held in
Toyon Lobby with the purpose of
fostering a still greater spirit than
that which prevails. During the
smoker, Jimmy Triolo will lead
yells and, if possible, pictures of
the Washington game will be shown.
Cigarettes will be passed out to all
attending.
