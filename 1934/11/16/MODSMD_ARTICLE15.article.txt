# Play Duelists Miss Thrusts; Stitches Taken
## 
### 
Realism vanquished by-play
at last night's performance of
"King Lear" as the duel, Ed
mund versus Edgar, resulted in
Edgar's having two stitches
taken above his eye today be
cause of mislaid battle plans
between the two contestants.
Edgar, who was supposed to
have survived unscathed in the
duel was the receiver of a blow
from Edmund's weapon in the
closing act of the play. Ed
mund, who by now should be
crossing the river Styx, is per
fectly well, although discon
certed over the affair. Edgar
managed to recover from the
attack sufficiently to fake the
killing of Edmund a second
time after the observant Ed
mund had already fallen down
dead.
Carlyle Steves played the
character of the injured Edgar,
and William Robertson, the
over-zealous dueler, took the
part of Edmund.
