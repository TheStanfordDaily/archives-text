# "College Ain't What She Used To Be," Says Gus
## 
### ROBERT EISENBACH 
"Boy," sighed Gus, "college sure
ain't what she used to be."
And Gus should know. He can
remember way back when the frosh
fnd the sophs both lived at Encina
Hall, and the girls used to serve
coffee and snails to upperclassmen
piling wood over by the boiler
works.
He can remember a lot more, too,
ii you just get him into conversation
at his shoe shine stand in the Encina
basement. His full name is Gus
Richards, but he will tell you to
foiget it. After all, you can afford
a little familiarity when you're pa
triarch of the hall and something of
an old sage to both the Row and
Dorm boys.
Gus is all of that. For 15 years
he has seen Stanford men come in as
wide-eyed frosh and graduate as
full-fledged students. He has shined
the shoes of generations of queeners.
He has seen the transition from
moleskins to flannels, and back
again. He has witnessed some migh
ty glamorous college doin's, and
that, he says, is what makes him
yearn for the Rood old days.
"You kids don't raise the roof any
more like you used to," he said.

"Why, I can remember when all
frosh had to wear dinks and jeans,
and couldn't smoke except for corn
cob pipes now and then."
"There was always something go
ing on. The old timers put. a mule
in the lobby one year, and the fresh
men used to spend their spare time
dragging trunks upstairs and run
ning errands for the sophs."
He waved his can of shoe polish.
"And the clothes, you should have
seen the clothes. No one dressed up
during the week. Old-time frosh
wore the same pair of pants until
they walked out of the corner when
their owners whistled. Only on
week-ends did they spruce up. And
then, did they dress! Sometimes I
shined 200 pairs of shoes a night.
"Now you fellows are well-dressed,
but it won't last," he continued,
shaking his head. "A couple of years
ago it w.'is the same story, before
they slipped back into moleskins.
You wait and see if it doesn't hap
pen all over."
"Change? Sure you fellows
change. But you're all the same at
heart. I've seen 'em since 1919, an'
believe me, they're all alike.
"The only thing that stops you is,
you haven I the chance." he winked.

again. He has witnessed some migh
ty glamorous college doin's, and
that, he says, is what makes him
yearn for the Rood old days.
"You kids don't raise the roof any
more like you used to," he said.

"Why, I can remember when all
frosh had to wear dinks and jeans,
and couldn't smoke except for corn
cob pipes now and then."
"There was always something go
ing on. The old timers put. a mule
in the lobby one year, and the fresh
men used to spend their spare time
dragging trunks upstairs and run
ning errands for the sophs."
He waved his can of shoe polish.
"And the clothes, you should have
seen the clothes. No one dressed up
during the week. Old-time frosh
wore the same pair of pants until
they walked out of the corner when
their owners whistled. Only on
week-ends did they spruce up. And
then, did they dress! Sometimes I
shined 200 pairs of shoes a night.
"Now you fellows are well-dressed,
but it won't last," he continued,
shaking his head. "A couple of years
ago it w.'is the same story, before
they slipped back into moleskins.
You wait and see if it doesn't hap
pen all over."
"Change? Sure you fellows
change. But you're all the same at
heart. I've seen 'em since 1919, an'
believe me, they're all alike.
"The only thing that stops you is,
you haven I the chance." he winked.
"Boy," sighed Gus, "college sure
ain't what she used to be."
And Gus should know. He can
remember way back when the frosh
fnd the sophs both lived at Encina
Hall, and the girls used to serve
coffee and snails to upperclassmen
piling wood over by the boiler
works.
He can remember a lot more, too,
ii you just get him into conversation
at his shoe shine stand in the Encina
basement. His full name is Gus
Richards, but he will tell you to
foiget it. After all, you can afford
a little familiarity when you're pa
triarch of the hall and something of
an old sage to both the Row and
Dorm boys.
Gus is all of that. For 15 years
he has seen Stanford men come in as
wide-eyed frosh and graduate as
full-fledged students. He has shined
the shoes of generations of queeners.
He has seen the transition from
moleskins to flannels, and back
again. He has witnessed some migh
ty glamorous college doin's, and
that, he says, is what makes him
yearn for the Rood old days.
