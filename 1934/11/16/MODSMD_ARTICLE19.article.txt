# MAUGHAM PLAY SCORES HIT IN FARM READING
## Leads Catch Satire of Play; Supporting Cast Good 
### Henry Brill 
Love and marriage were reduced
to a purely economic basis last night
in the Little Theatre, when Sword
and Sandals read Somerset Maugh
am's brilliant comedy, "The Constant
Wife." By the complete absence of
vacant seats, Sword and Sandals
proved that the popularity of their
readings remains undiminished.
What there is of plot in "The
Constant Wife" concerns the ex
ceedingly modern view which a
wife takes of her husband's in
fidelities. When it no longer re
mains possible for her to retain
this view and keep her vanity, she
runs off with a former suitor. But,
Maugham retains the flaunted
moderne by making his leading
lady promise to return to her
amazed husband at the end of
six weeks.
The humor of the play lies in the
sophistication of the dialogue and
situation. Maugham's rapier - like
thrusts at womankind and modern
marriage were' risque enough to
draw a few gasps of protest from
the interested audience.
Leads Excellent
Leading roles were taken by Har
riette Hall Kilby, as Constance, "The
Constant Wife," and by Waldo Salt,
as her unfaithful husband, John.
Fritzi-Beth Bowman took the part
of the attractive menace and Joe
Lawry played her dullard husband.
The scenes between these four were
the highlights of the play. They
caught all of the wit and satire of
Maugham's lines and interpreted
their roles with just the right amount
of savoir-faire. These four gave
real comedy to their lines, princi
pally because they had a poised un
derstanding and appreciation for
their roles.
Rosemary Benet, as Mrs. Culver,
was excellent. Her "toothbrush"
line will remain a remembered clas
sic of Stanford dramatic tradition.
She, too, got all of the comedy pos
sible out of her lines, without for
getting that she was portraying an
aged character.
Sincerity of effort, a most pleasing
voice, and a promise of talent failed
to keep George Woods from being
over-youthful in his role of the
romantic middle-aged suitor. It is
too bad that for his first reading he
should have been cast in such a
difficult, sophisticated role.
Newcomers Good
Isobel Devlin, another newcomer,
was good as the gossipy sister of
Constance. She had, however, a
tendency to let her voice drop after
lines in such a way as to make many
of them unintelligible to the audi
ence. Katherine Comrie, taking the
part of Barbara, an old friend, also
made a pleasing debut.
As a whole, the production lacked
the proper amount of finish neces
sary to a successful drawing-room
comedy. This may have been due
to serious tempo drags, caused by
faltering through lines in a semi
monotone so that all semblance of
dramatic build was lost.
Paul Crary's reading of directions
was on the whole, however, very
good and he is to be congratulated
for a successful production.

Isobel Devlin, another newcomer,
was good as the gossipy sister of
Constance. She had, however, a
tendency to let her voice drop after
lines in such a way as to make many
of them unintelligible to the audi
ence. Katherine Comrie, taking the
part of Barbara, an old friend, also
made a pleasing debut.
As a whole, the production lacked
the proper amount of finish neces
sary to a successful drawing-room
comedy. This may have been due
to serious tempo drags, caused by
faltering through lines in a semi
monotone so that all semblance of
dramatic build was lost.
Paul Crary's reading of directions
was on the whole, however, very
good and he is to be congratulated
for a successful production.
Love and marriage were reduced
to a purely economic basis last night
in the Little Theatre, when Sword
and Sandals read Somerset Maugh
am's brilliant comedy, "The Constant
Wife." By the complete absence of
vacant seats, Sword and Sandals
proved that the popularity of their
readings remains undiminished.
What there is of plot in "The
Constant Wife" concerns the ex
ceedingly modern view which a
wife takes of her husband's in
fidelities. When it no longer re
mains possible for her to retain
this view and keep her vanity, she
runs off with a former suitor. But,
Maugham retains the flaunted
moderne by making his leading
lady promise to return to her
amazed husband at the end of
six weeks.
The humor of the play lies in the
sophistication of the dialogue and
situation. Maugham's rapier - like
thrusts at womankind and modern
marriage were' risque enough to
draw a few gasps of protest from
the interested audience.
Leads Excellent
Leading roles were taken by Har
riette Hall Kilby, as Constance, "The
Constant Wife," and by Waldo Salt,
as her unfaithful husband, John.
Fritzi-Beth Bowman took the part
of the attractive menace and Joe
Lawry played her dullard husband.
The scenes between these four were
the highlights of the play. They
caught all of the wit and satire of
Maugham's lines and interpreted
their roles with just the right amount
of savoir-faire. These four gave
real comedy to their lines, princi
pally because they had a poised un
derstanding and appreciation for
their roles.
Rosemary Benet, as Mrs. Culver,
was excellent. Her "toothbrush"
line will remain a remembered clas
sic of Stanford dramatic tradition.
She, too, got all of the comedy pos
sible out of her lines, without for
getting that she was portraying an
aged character.
Sincerity of effort, a most pleasing
voice, and a promise of talent failed
to keep George Woods from being
over-youthful in his role of the
romantic middle-aged suitor. It is
too bad that for his first reading he
should have been cast in such a
difficult, sophisticated role.
