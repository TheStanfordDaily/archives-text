# "Y" Tour Set For Sunday
## 
### 
Today is the last day for Stanford
women to make reservations for the
Y.W.C.A. Russian tour which will
take place Sunday. The party will
start from the Women's Clubhouse at
1:45 o'clock and will drive to the
city.
All women are welcome to attend
and those taking cars will be paid
the cost of the gasoline. The cost of
the trip, including transportation
and dinner, will be 75 cents. Reser
vations should be made by calling
the "Y" rooms, 4301, or Jean DeVoss
in Lagunita,
When the party arrives in San
Francisco it will visit the Molokan
church for Russian peasants, the
International Institute, the Potrero
Hill neighborhood house, and will
have dinner in a Russian cafe where
there will be entertainment. Those
going on the tour will probably re
turn to the Stanford campus about
9 o'clock.
