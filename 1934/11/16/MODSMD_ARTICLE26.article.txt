# Tiny Hails Stanford Backfield As Most Versatile in History
## Frank Alustiza Will Play Fullback Position In Club Struggle 
### Millard Browne 
"A more versatile backfield than
any other we have had at Stanford,"
is t lie way Coach Tiny Thornhill
speaks of his Indian secondary.
And Tiny will strive to back up
this statement tomorrow, when
Stanford and the Olympic Club
footballers meet on the turf in
Stanford Stadium, by playing
Frankie Alustiza in the fullback
role.
He already has one fullback,
Bobby Grayson, whom no coach
could be ashamed of, and he has
tried Bones Hamilton at the same
position with astounding success, as
witness a 20 to 0 score favoring
Stanford over Northwestern.
Alustiza in New Role
But he will give Alustiza his big
chance at the heavy ball-carrying
in the "breather" with the Winged-O
men. Alustiza played fullback, but
lhat was as a flash for Stockton
High School and as a member of the
1932 Stanford yearlings. Since then
he was worked at quarterback.
Along with his ball-carrying the
new work will give Alustiza the
signal-calling duties.
Jhe "Owl-Eyed Basque" will
not start at fullback, however.
'1 hornhiil will use his regular first
string in the starting lineup, with
the exception of the running guard
position. With Woody Adams and
I5ol) Black both hobbling on
sprained ankles, he will dip into
the tiiird string and pick Tom
Callaghan for the opening work.
Adams may see part time action.
The regular backfield, including
Grayson at fullback, Hamilton and
Buck Van Dollen or Bob Maentz at
the wings, and Alustiza at quarter,
wii! open. The Indians' line will in
clude Keith Topping and Monk
Moscrip, ends; Bob Reynolds and
Claude Callaway, tackles; Larry
Rouble and Callaghan, guards; and
Wcs Muller, center.
Some time during the first half,
Grayson will take a rest, and
Alustiza will go to full, with either
Earl lloos or Stan Anderson re
placing him.
Thornhill has hopes of running up
a sale score early in order to give
his over-worked regulars a rest.
Grayson Has Cold
Grayson did not report for practice
last night, but remained in bed with
a slight cold. Topping, also victim of
a cold, was well enough for a light
workout, and the other team mem
bers were all on the field.
Stanford is not taking the Club
men lightly, but on the other hand
she canno # t afford to take them too
seriously. They are the only team
which has scored on Santa Clara
besides Stanford, and they have not
lost any game by more than a few
points. The powerful San Francisco
University Dons had some trouble in
eking out a dreary fi to 0 victory over
the Olympics last Sunday.
I)i spile of this, however, practice
all week has been directed at Cali
fornia, and, though the Cards should
win from the Club, the score may
not be as large as Sylvestre J.
Drofnats, (he office stooge, claims.

the exception of the running guard
position. With Woody Adams and
I5ol) Black both hobbling on
sprained ankles, he will dip into
the tiiird string and pick Tom
Callaghan for the opening work.
Adams may see part time action.
The regular backfield, including
Grayson at fullback, Hamilton and
Buck Van Dollen or Bob Maentz at
the wings, and Alustiza at quarter,
wii! open. The Indians' line will in
clude Keith Topping and Monk
Moscrip, ends; Bob Reynolds and
Claude Callaway, tackles; Larry
Rouble and Callaghan, guards; and
Wcs Muller, center.
Some time during the first half,
Grayson will take a rest, and
Alustiza will go to full, with either
Earl lloos or Stan Anderson re
placing him.
Thornhill has hopes of running up
a sale score early in order to give
his over-worked regulars a rest.
Grayson Has Cold
Grayson did not report for practice
last night, but remained in bed with
a slight cold. Topping, also victim of
a cold, was well enough for a light
workout, and the other team mem
bers were all on the field.
Stanford is not taking the Club
men lightly, but on the other hand
she canno # t afford to take them too
seriously. They are the only team
which has scored on Santa Clara
besides Stanford, and they have not
lost any game by more than a few
points. The powerful San Francisco
University Dons had some trouble in
eking out a dreary fi to 0 victory over
the Olympics last Sunday.
I)i spile of this, however, practice
all week has been directed at Cali
fornia, and, though the Cards should
win from the Club, the score may
not be as large as Sylvestre J.
Drofnats, (he office stooge, claims.
"A more versatile backfield than
any other we have had at Stanford,"
is t lie way Coach Tiny Thornhill
speaks of his Indian secondary.
And Tiny will strive to back up
this statement tomorrow, when
Stanford and the Olympic Club
footballers meet on the turf in
Stanford Stadium, by playing
Frankie Alustiza in the fullback
role.
He already has one fullback,
Bobby Grayson, whom no coach
could be ashamed of, and he has
tried Bones Hamilton at the same
position with astounding success, as
witness a 20 to 0 score favoring
Stanford over Northwestern.
Alustiza in New Role
But he will give Alustiza his big
chance at the heavy ball-carrying
in the "breather" with the Winged-O
men. Alustiza played fullback, but
lhat was as a flash for Stockton
High School and as a member of the
1932 Stanford yearlings. Since then
he was worked at quarterback.
Along with his ball-carrying the
new work will give Alustiza the
signal-calling duties.
Jhe "Owl-Eyed Basque" will
not start at fullback, however.
'1 hornhiil will use his regular first
string in the starting lineup, with
the exception of the running guard
position. With Woody Adams and
