# Today and Yesterday, Or the Chronicle and Sinclair
## 
### 
Politics may make strange bedfellows but
the aftermath seems to make even stranger
ones. Witness the series of front page ads
the S;in Francisco Chronicle is running about
t'pton Sinclair's series of articles on "How I
(lot Licked."
Less than two weeks ago anything by, for,
or about t'pton Sinclair, unless it was un
favorable, was anathema to the Chronicle.
The Bird of Paradise screamed is message of
bate from the front page, the news columns
carried yard after yard of pro-Merriam and
anti-Sinclair propaganda, while the editorial
columns shouted warnings of dire disaster
should the EPIC plan ever be put into opera
tion.
And on the other hand t'pton Sinclair waxed
hysterical and bitter in his charges against the
"hired liars." Both sides of the controversy
shrieked to the heavens their songs of hate
and fear.
Now, however, it seems that the lion and
the lamb, whichever may be which, are going
[o lie down together. It is not a strange phe
nomenon. It merely proves that the desire
for profit is a more powerful reconciling fac
tor than idealists would care to admit.
If t'pton Sinclair stood true to his belief
in the litter depravity and anti-social tend
encies of such newspapers as the Chronicle
he would nol help it to boost its circulation
and profits. If the Chronicle were linn in its
belief that t'pton Sinclair is an impractical
idealist and a demagogue, whose schemes
would lead only to folly, it would not publicize
him and his ideas.
The fact is, though, that the danger is past
and the Chronicle does not care. The oppor
tunity is past and Sinclair does nol care. The
desire for profit is the important considera
tion for both now. What hope for a Utopian
society when such motives dominate us?
Ideals have a tough time in a world like this.
