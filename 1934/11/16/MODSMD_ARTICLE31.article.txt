# Honor (and/or) What?
## 
### 
If I here be nnv skeptical observer who may
have wondered .jusl whal these honor soci
eties are all about and why they exist, he
need not search far nor long for the reason.
For the report of the students' organizations
fund, issued at the end of each liseal year,
tells all. Fxpressed in cold, hard dollars and
cents, the booklet contains complete vindica
tion of the honor societies, whose exact pur
pose has heretofore remained clouded in ob
scurity. It all seems so clear now.
The most mysterious of these so-called
honor societies, whose existence has continued
without apparent reason from year to year,
has one noble purpose at least. II gels a pic
ture in the Quad every year! By collecting
dues from all Ihe members and drawing upon
ils balance it manages to scrape up enough
to pay for the picture. Then the process is
repeated Ihe following year. II has no other
expenses because i! does nothing else.
Many honor societies have a more ambitious
purpose. They put on a dance, either for
themselves or for Ihe student hodv, Some

times tliev make money on the latter trans
action, sometimes they don't. If they don't,
the dues will take rare of the deficit, .lust why
the A.S.S.I', can't put on the dances itself has
not been explained. It would eliminate quite
a hit of auditing, the honor societies would
have no excuse for existing, the members
would not have to pay dues, and everybody
would be happy.
One of the chief reasons for the existence
of most of these honor societies is quite clear.
They pay dues to the national organization.
Large dues these are, too, nothing niggardly
about them, .lust what the members in
return is not quite so clear. Perhaps they
have never questioned. Maybe it just isn't
done.
It's all explained, now. Honor societies
exist to pay dues. The only doubtful point is
just what the honor part has to do with the
whole thing. Some honor societies are worth
while and the dues are consequently justi
fiable. The rest of them could well be dis
pensed with.
