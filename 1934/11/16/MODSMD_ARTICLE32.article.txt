# The 						Grand Old Party
## 
### 
The Republican party is now nestling in
the nadir ol political impotence, with rugged
Henry Fletcher, national committee chairman,
admonishing his aides that "When you're
licked, you're licked, but you don't have to
stay licked." It is a far cry from 1929, when
supposedly astute political commentators
were writing in national magazines and de
claring that the Democratic party had out
lived its usefulness and that there was really
no reason why it should not turn up its heels
and expire on the spot.
Thus far, no one of prominence has sug
gested that the Republican organization bow
itself permanently out of the picture. Perhaps
such will eventually be its fate, but the odds
appear to be of the 100 to one variety.
Since 19<T2 when the Democratic landslide
hit them a jolt in mid-section, the Republicans
have been able to do little in the way of carry
ing on a vigorous campaign. Withering blasts
have been blown about the Constitution: but
Roosevelt and his cohorts keep on smiling.
An ostensible Democrat, Al Smith, has done
more toward deflating the Bourbon boom with
a few curt and pithy phrases than the entire
Republican National Committee working un
der forced draft.
The Republicans have received their second
consecutive setback, and by now should turn
their attention to something other than the
Constitution. The party needs more young
blood and less antiquarian political bombast;
more economic thinking in terms of the
masses and less benefit for the privileged few.
In other words, the Republican party needs
an immediate and stimulating rejuvenation;
and until it convinces itself of this fact, the
American two-party System is going to suffer
temporary disuse. If the wise men of the
parly maintain their ostrich-head-in-the-hole
attitude toward the apparent trend of political
thought, then their carping forecasts about the
"dictatorship" are most likely to come true.
