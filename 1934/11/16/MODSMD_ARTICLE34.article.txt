## WITH CHILTON R. BUSH 
### CHARLOTTE BURRIDGE 
After a six-year investigation of public utilities
propaganda the Federal Trade Commission has now
completed the first of its final reports. Designed in all
probability as another "slap in the face" for big
business and a boost for government ownership, the
research has brought out facts upon which startling
accurations have been based. Utility companies are
held responsible for a propaganda campaign more
extensive than any other ever attempted with the
exception of government action in war time.
Professor Chilton R. Bush, head of the Department
of Journalism, has read the text of the hearings and
believes newspaper reports of the situation are exag
gerated. He speaks with authority on the phase of the
investigation which affects newspapers.
"There was more drama than common sense in
some of the aspects of the hearings a few years
ago. Investigators for the government succeeded
in turning up a lot of embarrassing correspond
ence. The findings reflected on the intelligence of
some of the officials of the National Electric Light
Association (now revised and rechristened the
Edison Institute), as much as it reflected on their
motives in spending large sums for propaganda and
charging the expenditures to operating costs.
"The prime movers in the propaganda machine were
hired publicity men who put down on paper a great
deal of bragging about the a mount of space and the
number of editorials they succeeded in inserting in
newspapers.
"As a matter of fact," the professor continued, "a
publicity man always exaggerates his accomplish
ments in order to keep on the payroll, and the utility
executives were made out to be worse offenders than
they actually were.
"Only a few small newspapers were stupid enough
to use propaganda material, although a large number
of publishers were opposed in principle to government
ownership and naturally made use of whatever material
came to hand.
The most sensational of (he disclosures. Bush
believes, was that of the purchase by the Inter
national Paper Company, affiliated with the In
ternational Power Company, of preferred stock in
certain large newspapers. The allied companies
also made loans to the papers.
"It was never shown that the International Paper
Company had any other motive than a desire to sell
more newsprint under the deplorable cut-throat con
ditions of competition in which that industry is em
bogged," the professor pointed out.
"The International paper and power concerns
found themselves in the power generating busi
ness as a result of accident, not design. They
acquired certain power sites in connection with
their paper mills, and discovered they had to
generate power in order to make a reasonable
return on their investment.
"They might have realized their motive would have
been misconstrued, but anybody who knows the com
petitive conditions in the newsprint industry under
stands why the risk was taken."
