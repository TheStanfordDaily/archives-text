"THE FIREBIRD"
At the Varsity Theatre
The Warners have become most
ambitious. No longer content with
the production of mere murder mys
teries, they now add for good meas
ure a mother love theme, as well as

a treatise on the
''youth prob
lem." Unfortu- j
nately, even a (
pretentious pho
toplay s(» weigh
ed down could
not succeed, and
this is an inex-

pensive and hastily conceived pro
duction. That the film is at all in
teresting is due to William Dieterle's '
clever, swift direction and the beauty j
of Verree Teasdale, who, to protect j
her daughter, confesses to the mur
der of Ricardo Cortez. Lionel Atwill
unconsciously burlesques, his role of
the father. C. Aubrey Smith's pres
ence contributes restraint and intel- '<
ligence to an otherwise extravagant, j
artificial play.

"NOYV AND FOREVER"
This is so good that even frozen
faced Carole Lombard appears in
terested at times. Gary Cooper ap
pears to excellent advantage oppo
site her as an adventurer who finds

difficulty in set
tling down, ne
cessitated by the
adoption of his
little girl. Shir
ley Temple, pos
sessed of the
most expressive
face on the

screen and a sense of humor, too, is
the child. "Now and Forever" evi
dences fine narrative writing, dis
tinguished by sincerity, natural dia
logue, and interesting characteriza
tions. —Lowe. '
