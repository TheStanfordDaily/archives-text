## TINSULL SECURITIES 
### 
What is your name?
Samuel Tinsull. The boys call me
Sammy.
What is your business?
Utility - Security - Baloney. The j
"Y's" rime nicely, don't you think
so?
Yeah, just like those in Easy j
Money.
That sounds like a dirty crack.
My money never came "easy." There
was money, but there were chances.
You mean, you took the money,
and the investors took the chances? i
Well, if you're going to be nasty, j
yes!
You said you were raised in j
England. What made you leave!
there?
I like Americans. They're so nice.
You mean, nice and foolish?
I resent that. Americans are
shrewd, keen, Yankee horsetraders :
—and also suckers. Is that being j
foolish? They saw Tinsull stock and i
they took it!
Or vice-versa.
But let's get down to brass j
knuckles, Mr. Tinsull. You know
that lots of people lost money in
your corporation?
Yes, but I'm sorry.
You know that you told investors !
some of your stock was worth $10,-
000,000 more than it actually was
worth?
Yes, but I'm sorry.
Do you know that there are a lot '
of over - mortgaged store - keepers, j

bankrupt business men, and penni
less messenger boys who would like
to take a good poke at you?
Yes, but I'm sorry.
Don't you think the United States
government ought to regulate busi- •
nesses like yours?
Yes, but I'm sorry. Or, er, that is j
to say, No. Things will get better.
America is fundamentally sound. \
George Washington is the Father of
Our Country. And we will start j
building all over again, bigger and
better?
Bigger and better gunny sacks?
1 have never held a gunny sack in i
my life.
But you've seen plenty others
holding them?
That's their tough luck! They
should have pulled out when I did.
But they didn't know that Tinsull
was not gold.
They'll know the next time, all
right!
But if they get wise, where will
you be?
OUCH!
