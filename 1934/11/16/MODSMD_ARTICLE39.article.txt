### 
I TIIINK 1 AM SLOWLY RECOV
ERING, by Winston Norman.
John Day, New York. 1934. (98
cents).

Winston Norman, ex-Stanford '02.
shoves a plasterer's trowel into the
white-washed New Deal and knocks
off several largo hunks of plaster.
The sight is very amusing, unless
you happen to be a Democrat and
still have faith. Mr. W. Norman,
an unemployed plasterer, had faith,
and he was a Democrat by inherit- i
ance. So, he wrote his government
a series of letters; the first to his
President, others to each of the al- I
phabetical bureaus which run
things these days. The plasterer's
index, it .seems, was down, so would
they please give him a little help to
tide him over, and could they send
him the President's autograph for
his collection?
The last of his letters, addressed
to the lion. Investigator, Department
of Investigation, reveals that Mr.
Norman has been jugged ay a Red.
And though he has not yet been
relieved, nor given the President's
autograph, he still remains a Hope
ful Democrat, his only desire being
to get to the point where he can
Slowly Recover.
Norman wields a satirical blade
that punctures political balloons
with a subtle acidity. The book
demonstrates intelligence and imagi
nation, particularly in the amusing
manner in which economic theories
of the New Deal are turned upon
themselves.
The book, if you've been follow
ing political movements, is very
funny, as are Berk Anthony's clev
cr illustrations. The latter's frontis
piece, concerning the best method
of reducing the milk supply, will
stand by itself as a masterpiece of
graphic representation.

Hundreds of men were killed in J
the World War after the Armistice
