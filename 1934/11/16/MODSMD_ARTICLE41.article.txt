# CAMPUS OPINION

The Editor, Sir:
Not that we are un-Moscripish or
anti-Graysonish —on the contrary,
we admire the two greatly and think
they deserve every word of praise |
that has been given to them.
But how about Alustiza? Ail we \
hear about him is that he's the |
battling Basque from Stockton, or j
perhaps, that he's in the hospital— j
which isn't very frequently. If there l
is anybody who deserves credit for j
playing football with body and soul, ;
it's Alustiza. He doesn't always talk j
and act football, but he certainly i
plays it.
Who does a lot of blocking, who
plunges through the line for good
gains, who makes those coffin-cor- j
ner-kicks, and who never says a '
word about it? It's Alustiza.
Now that we've got this off our
chest, how about giving credit where |
it is due? How about having a six ;
for Frank once in a while? Or is j
the name too difficult—or is it that
he's not a row man?
Sincerely and non-partisanly,
but plain justly,
L.A.R., F.L.M.
