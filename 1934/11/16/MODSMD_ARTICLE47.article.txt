# Artiste Will Dance Here
## 
### 
A recital by Vivian Wall, San
Francisco danseuse, will be the next j
program of the Tuesday Evening
Series to be held in the Assembly j
Hall at 7:30 o'clock.
An American dancer whose in- I
tensive training in the traditions of j
the Russian, Italian, and French
ballets has served as a background
for her natural ability for creative I
expression, Miss Wall has conceived j
a new style of dancing which she has j
termed "impressionistic."
Gifted in sculpture, music, and the
drama, Miss Wall applies her un
derstanding of these arts to her
dance interpretations. Her themes 1
are drawn from man and nature, |
and they visualize her ideals of 1
sound, emotion, and color.
Miss Wall has studied German, ;
Russian, French, and Italian meth- '
ods in Ihe different dance schools of,
Europe. In Dresden she worked at J
the Hellarau school with Delcrose, 1
and in Paris with Madame Gonts-'
chwara, Chatelat Theatre ballerina.
Although trained in these Euro
pean schools, Miss Wall is an Amer- 1
ican dancer who looks to her own
country for the expression of her
art.
Miss Wall was enthusiastically ac- .
claimed in San Francisco by the I
Women's City Club, which she j
danced before earlier in the month.
