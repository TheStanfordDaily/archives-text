# Comely Co-eds Star In Gaieties Chorus Routine
## 
### ANNALEE WHITMORE 
Twelve Stanford coeds, talented
and attractive, make their initial at
tempt at chorus-girling November
23 in the annual Big Game Gaieties.
Numbers ranging from tap to fan
dance are included in the repertoire
arranged by Meaudoin for the pro
duction.
Vicing with chorus rehearsals as
the center of interest is tonight's
personal San Francisco appearance
of three Gaieties stars — Barbara
Patton, Jim Copp, and Waily Baird.
Collegians To Attend
They will furnish dancing crowds
in the Embassy Room of the Hotel
St. Francis with a preview of the
November 23 performance. Baird,
with his piano numbers, Copp's mu
sical monologues, and Barbara Pat
ton's-tuneful songs are expected to
draw a sizeable campus crowd.
Five dance numbers have been
outlined—one tap, one tiller routine,
one solo by Phil Brown, a strut num
ber, and a ballet with fan. The tap.

considers Beaudoin, is especially
notable, as few of the chorines have
had previous experience, yet picked
up the technique with little diffi
culty.
The tiller, or high-kick number,
calls for somewhat acrobatic profi
ciency, also evidenced by the twelve.
The strut, or high-hat-and-cane type
of dance, was completed in this
week's rehearsals, and work on the
ballet will be well under way Sat
urday.
Fan Dance Planned
Stanford fan dances, unlike Sally
Rand's, will feature full-length
white ballet costumes. Brilliant red
fans three feet in width will afford
a vivid contrast.
One tentatively-slated dance will,
if included, prove most novel of all.
The "ghoul chorus," with pantomime
rather than dancing alone, will at
tempt to depict Macbeth's con
science.
Mail orders are being filled now;
campus sale begins Monday.
