# BRONCS FAVORED 10-6 OVER GAELS IN ANNUAL BATTLE
## California Plays Idaho Men At Berkeley; Oregon, U.S.C. Tangle 
### 
Whether or not a Gael, who has
been in the saddle for 11 years, can
maintain his position astride the
Bronco will be decided this Sunday
in Kezar Stadium when the unde
feated Santa Clara Broncos tangle
with the St. Mary's Gaels in a game
of football that from all indications
should be one of the best, if not the
best game, played on the Coast this
season.
With every available seat sold
out, nearly 50,000 people will go to
see if the twice beaten Gaels can
upset the 10-0 odds favoring the
Broncos and make it 12 straight
wins over Santa Clara. Upset twice
this year, once by Nevada's 9-7
victory and once by U.C.L.A.'s (J-0
win, the Moraga men are in a fight
ing mood which bodes no good for
the clean record of Maurice "Clip
per" Smith's men.
Cal Meets Idaho
Saturday's gridiron contests will
draw little interest from bay fans, i
Stanford meets the improving Olym
pic Club eleven in what is .supposed
to be a breather for the Indians be
fore the Big Game. At Berkeley, j
California, jubilant because of their
victory over Troy, face a determined
invasion by the Idaho Vandals, who
held the Golden Bears to a 6-0 tally
last season.
In the southland the battered Tro
jan horse again faces tough opposi
tion in the University of Oregon.
Humors from the S.C. campus say
that Howard Jones has finally found
the right men for the proper places.
Oregon has had their men well
placed all season. Maybe S.C. won't
win any conference games this sea
son.
At Corvallis, Oregon State looks
forward to winning their first con
ference game when they engage
Montana. The Beavers held Oregon
to a 9-G score last week-end and
seem to be at their peak. Montana
has victories over two minor teams
from Montana and has lost to Wash
ington State, U.C.L.A., Idaho, and
Oregon.

to be a breather for the Indians be
fore the Big Game. At Berkeley, j
California, jubilant because of their
victory over Troy, face a determined
invasion by the Idaho Vandals, who
held the Golden Bears to a 6-0 tally
last season.
In the southland the battered Tro
jan horse again faces tough opposi
tion in the University of Oregon.
Humors from the S.C. campus say
that Howard Jones has finally found
the right men for the proper places.
Oregon has had their men well
placed all season. Maybe S.C. won't
win any conference games this sea
son.
At Corvallis, Oregon State looks
forward to winning their first con
ference game when they engage
Montana. The Beavers held Oregon
to a 9-G score last week-end and
seem to be at their peak. Montana
has victories over two minor teams
from Montana and has lost to Wash
ington State, U.C.L.A., Idaho, and
Oregon.
Gonzaga in Kansas
Gonzaga, enjoying a prolonged
stay in Kansas, where they defeated
Washburn 2-0 last Friday, meets
Wichita University in Wichita,
Kansas, tomorrow. A contest of
somewhat minor importance finds
U.S.F. and Loyola playing in Los
Angeles on Sunday.
Other minor games are: San Jose
State versus Pacific at Stockton;
Chico versus Nevada at Reno; Cali
fornia Ramblers versus Cal Aggies
at Davis.
Whether or not a Gael, who has
been in the saddle for 11 years, can
maintain his position astride the
Bronco will be decided this Sunday
in Kezar Stadium when the unde
feated Santa Clara Broncos tangle
with the St. Mary's Gaels in a game
of football that from all indications
should be one of the best, if not the
best game, played on the Coast this
season.
With every available seat sold
out, nearly 50,000 people will go to
see if the twice beaten Gaels can
upset the 10-0 odds favoring the
Broncos and make it 12 straight
wins over Santa Clara. Upset twice
this year, once by Nevada's 9-7
victory and once by U.C.L.A.'s (J-0
win, the Moraga men are in a fight
ing mood which bodes no good for
the clean record of Maurice "Clip
per" Smith's men.
Cal Meets Idaho

draw little interest from bay fans, i
Stanford meets the improving Olym
pic Club eleven in what is .supposed
