One more mural football aggrega
tion advanced to semi-final standing
in the rapidly closing season as Se
quoia l's potent passers got the
jump on an equally efficient passing
Phi Sigma Kappa outfit to win a
play-off contest 7 to 0, in the only
game scheduled yesterday.
The Phi Sigs were champions of
League 4, while Sequoia was on top
of the heap in League 8. A long,
beautifully executed pass from Bill
Ladue to Charlie White was respon
sible for the Sequoia win, in a nip
and-tuck game. White converted
from placement to complete the scor
ing. Ladue was the star of the Se
quoia men. For the losers, Robert
Wardwell, with his accurate and
efficient tossing, was outstanding as
was Mondavi.
Today another pair of league win
ners tangle for semi-final 'oualifica
tion.

| As football rapidly draws to com
pletion, a new intramural activity
appears on the scene of action with
the announcement yesterday by
Manager Marvie Kahn that the an
nual mural fall track and field meet
will be run off next Thursday and
j Friday, November 22 and 23. Twen
ty-five organizations have entered
teams in the meet, which will in
clude every regular event of the
Pacific Coast track conference, with
the exception that a four-man 880-
! yard relay will be run in place of
! the mile relay.
The various events will be distrib
uted equally over the two days, with
' an announcement of the order of
I raccs being issued in several days.
El Toro is the defending mural track
champ.
Kahn emphasized the fact that all
1 second- and third-round matches in
; mural handball competition must be
played off by Tuesday. Also golfers
are urged to play scheduled matches
more promptly so as not to unduly
delay completion of the mural tour
! ney in that sport.
