# CARD FRESHMEN, CALCUBS ENGAGE IN SOCCER FRAY
## 
### 
Preceding the varsity soccer
game tomorrow morning will be the
biggest game of the year for Card
freshmen—the first battle with the
Cal frosh.
John Moore, freshman coach,
looks for an even contest with the
Bear cubs. He points to the fact that
both teams have made about the
same showing in games already
played this season. However, San
Mateo beat Cal and last week Stan
ford took the measure of San Ma
teo. If the field is dry the Cardinal
'38 men should have an edge.
Frosh Select Captain
Tonight the frosh will get together
and select one of their number as
captain. They will also be put
through their final scrimmage this
afternoon. Moore has been working
hard on heading and trapping drills
and feels that all his men now have
good control of the ball.
The line-up tomorrow is set with
the exception of two positions.
Helms will start in Noll
at right fullback and Williams at
left back. Smith may also be used
in the left back position. On the
halfback line will be Douglas on the
left, Sloane in the middle and either
Kearne or Busche on the right.
Thcee Centers
At center forward there are three
men who may possibly see action:
Everett, Strazer and Shaw. Schaupp
will play outside left and Boyd in
side right. Parker will play at left
wing and Deßenedetti, possibly the
most talented player on the squad,
will be in at inside left.
