•I'ILD NEW ONES
It's a case of old all-Americans
uilding new ones on the Stanford
lotbull team this year. Monk Mos
rip, end, and Bobby Grayson, full -
ck, are usually considered nearly
ertuin choices for all-American dis
inction this year. And look who's
n the coaching .staff.
Jim Lawson, one of the best
ends the Coast has seen, works
out nightly with Moscrip; and
Ernie Nevers, oftci. considered
the greatest fullback of all time,
directs Grayson's activities.
Grayson is the kind of player who
joks just as good in practice as he
oes in a game. He takes the daily
/orkouts more seriously than most
f the other varsity players, and he
racks the line nearly as hard against
he third string as he docs against
California.
Those concerned with Stanford's
hy.sical welfare lese pounds during
very scrimmage while Grayson is
laying, but somehow the Boomer
lways gets up from a tackle just as
re.sh as ever.
ACK OF INJURIES
,OT ALL LUCK
A San Francisco columnist re
ently spoke of (he fact that Stan
ird has been lucky with injuries as
thai were one of the main reasons
ne Indians rate above California,
/ho have been troubled with fatal
urts off and on all season.
It is true, Stanford has survived
without a major mishap, while
the Bears have had all sorts of
trouble with their personnel. But
it is not all, or even mostly, luck.
One of the most important rca
ns for Stanford's good fortune is
lat the Card players are not beaten
ito shape. Their attitude is good,
nd they keep themselves in condi
on, so that one scrimmage a week
; sufficient. California holds scrim
lage several times between games.
•y the law of averages, Stanford
hould not, and does not, suffer in
jries in the middle of the week.
Every Stanford ailment, except for
ne, has been the result of a game,
ut several times, during the middle
f a week, headlines concerning
ear players have read, "Blotz Out
>r Season."
lIEY'VE LEARNED
iOW TO FALL
Bones Hamilton is the best ex
unpic of a Stanford player know -
ing "how to fall" when he is
tackled. Frequently Bones is the
ast man on rhe field to get up
liter a play. When he knows he
las been tackled he has mastered
he knack of relaxing and falling
imp. He rests for a moment and
lien gets up as fresh as ever.
There are certain injuries, such as
ailed, shoulder muscles, sprained
iklcs, or hip bruises, that can hap
;n no matter how experienced a
ayer is in taking a beating. Nearly
1 of the Stanford mishaps have
ime under these heads.
