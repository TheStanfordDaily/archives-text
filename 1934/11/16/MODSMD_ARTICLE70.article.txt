# Card Water Stars Seek Title Tomorrow
## WINGED 'O' LOOMS AS BIGGER THREAT THAN CALIFORNIA Club Team Features Four Olympic Champions; Use Card System 
### 
In what should be one of the best
games ever seen on the Farm, varsity
water polo teams of Stanford and the
Olympic Club will meet in Encina
pool at 1 o'clock tomorrow afternoon.
Everything is at stake, since the un
defeated, league champion Cardinals
must win in order to retain their
hold on first place, and extend their
winning streak to 19 straight.
Willi an individually brilliant,
smoothly working veteran seven,
the Olympians present a threat
unexcelled even by that of Cali- \
forma to the Stanford record. Four
veterans of the Olympic Games i
should alone be enough for Nort
Thornton's paddlers to worry
about, but five of the regular club- 1
men are also ex-Indians who know
the Stanford style of attack to
perfection.
The clubmen think so well of that
system that they have adopted it |
themselves, and will exhibit the old
Stanford attack today, playing the '
quick-breaking, short-passing Hun
garian type of game. The present !
Card outfit is the first to digress from
this >>tyle, and the American system
which the Indians will exhibit today
involves longer passes, with the team !
"laying them out" for Captain Leo
Cook,
Speed and experience are on the i
club side, pitted against perfect
condition and great fighting cour
age for Stanford. The Cardinals '
proved thai they had the latter
quality when they came from the
shoit end of a 5-2 score against
U.C.L.A., and won in the final
three minutes. A man-for-man
comparison between these two
great teams shows what a toss-up
the game will be.
Elmer Collette, club goalie and in
ternationally famous, must be given
a slight edge over Stanford's, im
proved sophomore, Bob Haslacher.
George Mitchell of the Olympians is
rated higher than Bob Sutherland,
Indian guard, and Gordon Graves,
just out of Stanford, gives the
Winged "O" an advantage over
Wally Wiget of the Cards'. Nort
Thornton's men should offset this
at the other guard post, with Bill .
Woodard conceded a shade over
Marshall Dunn of the clubmen.
Ted Wiget, former Stanford great,
is rated on a par with Vlad Taranik, j
sensational Cardinal forward. Wiget '
is faster, but Taranik is the more I
deadly shot. Bob Foster is about. :
equal to Whitey Burns, another ex- i
Indian now playing for the club, at
right forward.
Captain Cook, rated by Coach
Thornton as probably the best for
ward in America today, stands
bead and shoulders over Ginger I
Austin, Olympic Games star now I
on the Winged "O" septet. Stan
ford lias an advantage over the
clubmen in reserve strength, since
Bill ClemO at forward, and Jimmy |
Benet and Ben Voss at guard can !
go in lor Foster and Sutherland
without weakening the team to i
any extent.
Thornton announces the following
starting line-up for Stanford: for
wards, Captain Leo Cook, Vlad Tara- ,
nik, and Bob Foster; guards, Wally I
Wiget, Bill Woodard, and Bob Suth-1
erlcnd; goalie, Bob Haslacher.
The Card junior varsity will play I
the Olympic Club reserves in the 1
preliminary at 12 o'clock. The var
sity game, to which all students will i
be admitted free of charge, will be !

In what should be one of the best
games ever seen on the Farm, varsity
water polo teams of Stanford and the
Olympic Club will meet in Encina
pool at 1 o'clock tomorrow afternoon.
Everything is at stake, since the un
defeated, league champion Cardinals
must win in order to retain their
hold on first place, and extend their
winning streak to 19 straight.
Willi an individually brilliant,
smoothly working veteran seven,
the Olympians present a threat
unexcelled even by that of Cali- \
forma to the Stanford record. Four
veterans of the Olympic Games i
should alone be enough for Nort
Thornton's paddlers to worry
about, but five of the regular club- 1
men are also ex-Indians who know
the Stanford style of attack to
perfection.
The clubmen think so well of that
system that they have adopted it |
themselves, and will exhibit the old
Stanford attack today, playing the '
quick-breaking, short-passing Hun
garian type of game. The present !
Card outfit is the first to digress from
this >>tyle, and the American system
which the Indians will exhibit today
involves longer passes, with the team !
"laying them out" for Captain Leo
Cook,
Speed and experience are on the i
club side, pitted against perfect
condition and great fighting cour
age for Stanford. The Cardinals '
proved thai they had the latter
quality when they came from the
shoit end of a 5-2 score against
U.C.L.A., and won in the final
three minutes. A man-for-man
comparison between these two
great teams shows what a toss-up
the game will be.
Elmer Collette, club goalie and in
ternationally famous, must be given
a slight edge over Stanford's, im
proved sophomore, Bob Haslacher.
George Mitchell of the Olympians is
rated higher than Bob Sutherland,
Indian guard, and Gordon Graves,
just out of Stanford, gives the
Winged "O" an advantage over
Wally Wiget of the Cards'. Nort
Thornton's men should offset this
at the other guard post, with Bill .
Woodard conceded a shade over
Marshall Dunn of the clubmen.
Ted Wiget, former Stanford great,
is rated on a par with Vlad Taranik, j
sensational Cardinal forward. Wiget '
is faster, but Taranik is the more I
deadly shot. Bob Foster is about. :
equal to Whitey Burns, another ex- i
Indian now playing for the club, at
right forward.
Captain Cook, rated by Coach
Thornton as probably the best for
ward in America today, stands
bead and shoulders over Ginger I
Austin, Olympic Games star now I
on the Winged "O" septet. Stan
ford lias an advantage over the
clubmen in reserve strength, since
Bill ClemO at forward, and Jimmy |
Benet and Ben Voss at guard can !
go in lor Foster and Sutherland
without weakening the team to i
any extent.
Thornton announces the following
starting line-up for Stanford: for
wards, Captain Leo Cook, Vlad Tara- ,
nik, and Bob Foster; guards, Wally I
Wiget, Bill Woodard, and Bob Suth-1
erlcnd; goalie, Bob Haslacher.
The Card junior varsity will play I
the Olympic Club reserves in the 1
preliminary at 12 o'clock. The var
sity game, to which all students will i
be admitted free of charge, will be !
over in time for fans to reach the |
