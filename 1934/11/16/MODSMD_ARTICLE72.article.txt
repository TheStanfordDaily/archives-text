We don't know what to eft) with
Sylvestre J. these days. He just
conies home and mopes around. He
won't bring in the wood or wash
the dishes as he is supposed to.
Ma says she thinks he must be in
love. So she's keeping him home
today, and sent me over to write
his story for him. I think the trouble
is that he used to be in love with
the voice of the telephone girl, and
now that the dial phones are in
stalled, the dial tone is all he has
left. It just keeps buzzing through
his head.
I'll bet he gets the usual amount
of v/rong numbers. Sylvestre be
lieves in calling a spade a spade.
He says that the object of Stanford's
affection will turn to a royal flush
and the Cards will Club the Olym
pics 28-0.
Sylvestre J. told me before I
left, "California will beat Idaho 13
to 6, and Idaho lot rather they
didn't. Howard Jones is going after
another football recordâ€”22 consecu
tive defeats. Oregon will give him a

boost on the way by winning 7-0. :
"Navy will roll up the score, but
Pittsburgh will take it home under
its arm. Pitt will beat Navy 13-7.
" 'Harry the Horse' will be pitch
ing, but Sobrero will be catching,
and 'Harry the Horse' will be knock
ed out of the box (out 1o lunch).
Santa Clara will outslug the Gaels
13-7."
Sylvestre gets those spells every
one in a while. But we have to
humor him. The rest of his mistakes
follow:
Minnesota 21, Chicago 0
Illinois 13, Wisconsin G
Syracuse 14, Colgate 7
Alabama 20, Georgia Tech 0 (by
three Techdowns)
College of Pacific 14, San Jose
State 0
Oregon Slate 20, Montana 0
Notre Dame 14, Northwestern 0

can't Michigan)
