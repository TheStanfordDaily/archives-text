# Colgate, Syracuse Fight For Rose Bowl Chance
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Nov. 15 (/P).—lt may
be "On to the Rose Bowl" for the
survivor of Saturday's traditional
football clash between Colgate and
Syracuse.
It is much too early, perhaps, lo
hazard a guess on the annual ques
tion—Who is going to Pasadena?—
but there are strong grounds for
chance as any and a much better one
belief that either one of the up-state
New York teams has as good a
chance as any and a much better
chance than most.

or five years after they have been
