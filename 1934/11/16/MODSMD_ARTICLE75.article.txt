# Farm, U.C. Soccermen Play First Series Game
## 
### JOHN McClelland 
To the Card soccer team tomorrow ,
will be afforded the first opportunity
of the year to iake a wholesome j
crack at California.
Bear soccermen invade the cam
pus tomorrow morning at 10
o'clock to play the first of the
annual soccer series between
Stanford and U.C. The final of
these "big" games will be played
in Berkeley a week from tomor
row.
For many years Stanford has been j
taking the measure of the Golden j
Bear in soccer with clock-like regu
larity. Occasionally Cal won a game
or so, but the Indians usually came
out on top. This year, however,
things are going to be a little tighter. I
Stanford trails Cal in conference 1
standing. But the same teams that
have beaten Stanford have also
beaten the Bears. From nearly every
angle tomorrow's battle looks even. |
The score ought to be small and the
victor should not win by more than |
a single goal.
On the very eve of the game
Coach Harry Maloney is still a
little undecided about his forward j
line. All season he has been try- i
ing new combinations in the ef
fort to find one that will click.
One of the biggest problems is the
right flank. Jeeb Halaby and AI
Dibblce work well together but
not consistently. Herb Sawyer and
Pete Knecht present the same
problem.
The forward wall tomorrow may
read from left to right: Enke, Row, j
Novarro, Dibblee, and Halaby or >
the names of Gomez, Knecht, Saw
yer, and Nightingale may be sub
stituted.
At present the halfback iine con
sists of Hall, White, and Gonzales, j
All three have proven themselves
stellar players this season, and all
are capable of shifting about to fill
in in other positions.
At fullback will be Bud Walker
and either Dick Bullis or Hank Ev
ersole. Bullis was injured last Sat
urday and may not be able to play
all of the game tomorrow.
Cal lost rather heavily from grad- j

nation this year but still has enough
veterans back to present a fairly
experienced eleven. Lawrence, left
beck, and Hibbard, inside left, both
rated conference honors last year j
und will play tomorrow. Two others j
that Stanford will be wary of are
Andresen, center half, and Norton, ,
inside right.
This afternoon a final scrimmage
will be held and last minute in
structions given to the squad. To- j
night the squad will be the guests I
of the Stanford theatre at the first
evening performance.
