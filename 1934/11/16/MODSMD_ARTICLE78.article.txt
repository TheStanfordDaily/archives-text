# Four Drown; 20,000 Bereft In Philippines
## Telegraph Communication Disrupted to Manila 
### 
MANILA, P.1., Nov. 15 (/P).—Four
fishermen were reported drowned oil
Catbalogan, on (he Island of Samar,
in the first accounts of loss of life
in yesterday's devastating typhoon.
Estimates placed the homeless at
20,000 in Naga, provincial capital on
Luzon island, alone.
Red Cross Prepared
Red Cross relief workers prepared
to leave on the first train tomorrow
for Naga, apparently the most hard
hit of any city in the islands.
The quartet drowned off Catba
logan were fishing when the gale
overturned their launch. A fifth
native was swept out into the ocean,
but his fate was not determined.
Catbalogan is the capital of Samar,
an island in the Visayas group south
of Luzon.
Telegraphic communication be
tween Manila and eleven provinces,
mostly south of here, was disrupted
by the storm, the worst of the many
that have struck the archipelago in
the last six weeks. A few radio sta
tions furnished the only communi
cation to these sections and reported
heavy devastation and many missing.
Manila Escapes
Manila escaped the full force of
the blast, but was swept by winds
reaching a maximum of 48 miles an
hour. Heavy rains, which flooded
some districts, resulted in the dis
missal of schools, interfered with
business, halted shipping and
brought railway service to a stand
still.
The railway agent at Naga re
ported "80 per cent" of the palm
thatched bamboo dwellings of the
natives in the city were blown down
by the 80-mile an hour gale.
