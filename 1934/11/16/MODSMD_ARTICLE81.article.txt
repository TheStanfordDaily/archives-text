# OPERA ASSOCIATION PRESENTS 'MANON' ON MONDAY NIGHT
## 
### 
With the success of the opening
performance forecasting an excep
tionally brilliant season, the San
Francisco Opera Association will lac
gin its second week Monday night
with a performance of "Manon,"
Gaetano Merola conducting.
The title roles will be played by
Richard Crooks, who is singing in
opera in San Francisco for the first
time, and Lucreicia Boi'i, the soprano
who made her San Francisco debut
last year as the petite but misguided
Manon.
"Madame Butterfly" will be sung
Wednesday night with Lotte Leh
mann as Cho - Cho - San and Dino
Borgioli as Pinkerton. Pietro Ci
mini will be on the conductor's
podium for the first time this season.
The performance of "Lakme," set
for Friday will bring Emily
Hardy, San Francisco soprano, to
the opera stage for the first time in
a leading role. Miss Hardy's suc
cess in "Coq D Or" and "Boheme"
last season induced General Direc
tor Gaetano Merola to produce
"Lakme" this year for his new star.
Mario Chemlee will sing opposite
Miss Hardy with Alfred Gendolfi
and Ezio Pinza heading the sup
porting cast. The exotic Hindu
dances created for the opera by
Ballet Director Adolph Bolm will
have as background the bizarre set
tings designed by Armando Agnini.
