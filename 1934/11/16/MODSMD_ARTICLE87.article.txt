# COVERED ZIPPER NOW FIRST CHOICE FOR COLLEGE CLOTHES
## 
### 
"Best-dressed" seniors at America's lead
inu colleges are definitely against the clumsy
old-fashioned fly. Though they prefer the
smooth flat slide-fastened fly, they are also
opposed to the uncovered zipper which dis
plays a strip of bare metal. Kover-Zip, (ho
invisible seamline closure demanded by
Rood taste, has won approval in colleges
from coast to coast. Here are a few typical
comments on Kover-Zip by college men
selected as "beat-dressed":

Joseph A. Lowe
California, H134
"The fellow who in
vented the covered zip
per certainly knocked
out a home run; it does
away with the raw metal
in the ordinary zipper.
I want the covered zip
on all my trousers."

Harold I". Logan
Northwestern, 1931
"The covered zipper
has many advantages
over the button fly, I
am in favor of it. Every
day more college men
realize the value of the
covered zip, see for your
self what they wear."

Matthew E. Welsh
Pennsylvania, 1934
"Give me a zipper fly
every time, though I
admit the uncovered
metal of the first type of
zipper was crude. The
new covered zipper with
the invisible closure is
a natural for the fly."

Stanley I. Kishol
Columbia, 1931
' Kover-Zip is the right
closure for trousers, it
gives the smart smooth
flat effect in front, yet
unlike the ordinary zip
per t here is no unsightly
strip of exposed metal.
I am for Kover-Zip."
