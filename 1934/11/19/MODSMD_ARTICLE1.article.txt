# CLERGY TAKES UP DEFENSE OF DAVID LAMSON
## Concert Pulpit Drive Is Result of Eight Months Of Investigation BAIL RELEASE ASKED District Attorney Thomas To Ask for New Trial 
### John McClelland 
Yesterday was "Lamson Defense
Sunday" in the San Francisco Bay
region.

And as David Lamson iat hope
fully in his dingy cell in the anti
quated Santa Clara County jail
waiting for developments in his plea
for release on bail, ten prominent
clergymen in San Jose and San
Francisco mounted their pulpits and
made public their firm belief that
the former Stanford executive is in
nocent and that he was the victim
of an unfair trial.
Another Trial
Meanwhile the questions of
whether Lamson will have to go
through another trial and whether
he will be released on bail still hang
in the balance.
Yesterday's concerted pulpit drive
for the exoneration of Lamson came
as' a result of an eight months' in
vestigation by the social service
commission of the State Federation
of Churches. The commission re
ported unanimously that Lamson s
trial was unfair and a majority of
the members declared he was in
nocent.
Leads Drive
Leading the drive was Dr. Jason
Noble Pierce of the First Congrega
tional Church of San Francisco, who
was one of the principal speakers at
a mass Lamson defense meeting held
in Palo Alto recently.
Dr. Pierce emphasized the state
ment of August Vollmer, noted
criminologist, who summarizes the
case by saying:
"This is the outstanding case on
record of a man convicted of a crime
that never was committed . . . Let us
pray that he soon will bo released,
welcomed back by his friends and
neighbors, and given the same re
spected place in society that he was
forced to forsake."
Asks Release
Llast Tuesday so-called startling
allegations bearing on the alleged
murder of his wife by David Lamson
were laid before District Attorney
Fred Thomas of San Jose. Thursday
Thomas made the statement that he
would ask for a new trial "unless
there is some surprise motion made
by the other side."
Last Friday Lamson's attorney
asked for the release of his client
on bail. The district attorney has
not yet decided whether or not he
will oppose the motion for bail re
lease.
On November 30 Judge Robert
Syer, the man who pronounced the
death sentence on Lamson, will pre
side over the court which will pass
judgment on both the questions of a
new trial and on the request for bail.
Since there is a precedent for re
lease on bail of a man accused of
murder, the defense attorneys feel
confident that their request will be
granted. They revealed that they
are ready to post as much as $50,000
bail.
