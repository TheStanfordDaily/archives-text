# ALL IS WELL SAYS F.R. IN LATEST TALK
## Usual Confidence Displayed By Chief Executive In Southern Speech 
### 
TUPELO, Miss., Nov. 18 (/P). -
President Roosevelt asserted today
that "all is well with the country
and we are coming back," and pi e
seribed the Tennessee Valley power
and rehabilitation experiment for
nation-wide operation.
Speaking extemporaneously from
a hillside of this pioneer town of the
Tennessee Valley development, the
President said:
"You are not being federalized. We
still believe in the community, and
things are coming to advance in this
country exactly in proportion to the
community effort.
"This is not regimentation. It is
community rugged individualism. It
means no longer the kind of rugged
individualism that allows an in
dividual to do this, that, or the other
thing that will hurt his neighbors."
Mr. Roosevelt revealed his deter
mination to go ahead with, the new
deal and declared his "deep-seated
belief" that:
"The people of this nation under
stand what we are trying to do, are
co-operating with what we are try
ing to do and have made up their
minds that we are going to do it."
Looking upon another throng of
faces such as marked his every stop
through the valley, the President
remarked:
"Today I see not only hope but I
see determination â€” knowledge that
all is well with the country and that
we are coming back."
