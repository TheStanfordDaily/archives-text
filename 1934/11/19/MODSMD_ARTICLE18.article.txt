Coopers Entertain
The rest of the afternoon was

| home of Professor and Mrs. W. A.
j Cooper.
Accompanying Dr. Luther from
j San Francisco were Secretary of
' Legation Dr. Gustav Struve, Consul
| General Dr. Gustav Heuser and Mis.

! members of the German department
| faculty and their wives, German
, students who have been in Ger
| many or who plan to go there in
the near future, Mrs. Robert E.
Swain, and Professor R. D. Harri
| man.
The interior of Professor Cooper's
| house was decorated to suggest the
simple motif used in Germany to
welcome an honored guest. After

! refreshments were served, Dr. Lu
ther was asked to speak in German
ft: the whole group, and responded
with a discussion of some of the
more important problems of teach
ing German in a foreign country.
He is an admirable illustration of
what the Germans call "gemuet
lich," and he has a fine sense of
humor.
