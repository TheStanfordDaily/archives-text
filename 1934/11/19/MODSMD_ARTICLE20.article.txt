# COBB 10 LEAVE FOR NEW YORK
## Campus Council's President Joins Greek Meet 
### 
George Cobb, Interfraternity
Council president, leaves the campus
tomorrow for New York City, where
he will attend a national interfra
ternity convention at Hotel Roosevelt.
Interested in the fraternity set-up
in other colleges, Cobb will visit uni
versities on his trip East and on his
way back in order to find out the
way they handle their problems.
'"Our fraternities here at Stanford
will stand out above all others at
the convention," says Cobb. "We do
not have any definite problems."
"Fraternities are closely super
vised by the Interfraternity Board
of Control, and there is not the
financial problem that many other
schools have."
Cobb will travel east on the north
ern route. He will visit the Uni
versity of Washington, the Univer
sity of Michigan, and Cornell, re
turning after the convention by a
different route. It will be determined
by the knowledge he will gain about
the fraternity systems in different
colleges at the convention.
Cobb may not return to the Farm
until the end of the quarter.
