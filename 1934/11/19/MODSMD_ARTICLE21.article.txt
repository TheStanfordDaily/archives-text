# Need Boxes As Fire Fuel
## 
### 
"Boxes, boxes, boxes" is the plea
of Bob Jones, Big Game Bonfire
committee chairman, for "box day"
tomorrow. This is a new event to
Stanford in which every student is
asked to find a box of some descrip
tion, preferably wood, and bring it
to Ihe site of the bonfire.
This move is being made as a "de
pression" action to prevent the an
tagonism of the surrounding popu
lace caused by the giving up of
wood needed for the public's own
use.
Already the main poles for the
structure have been set up and the
"draft ditches" dug. Built under a
new plan of construction, the fire
will be in the form of a triangle
with sides of 30 feet at the base.
Instead of going straight up the
frame will be in the shape of a
pyramid which is expected to reach
a peak at least 35 feet above the
ground. The flue will also be in this
shape instead of the usual square.
The Associated Oil Company has
contributed 250 gallons of oil for
the event and is also furnishing one
of their loudspeaker-equipped au
tomobiles to get workers out to the
site of the fire Wednesday.
Telegraph pples were furnished
and set in the ground by the Pacific
Gas and Electric Company.
