# WEEK-END RAINS STOP ONLY FOR FOOTBALL GAME
## 
### 
Stanford's new coeds were for
mally initiated to one of those un- j
usual Lo.s Angeles "mists" this week- j
end. Yesterday many of them .scam
pered, slid, and slopped to the Cit
library, and other places of recrea
tion. There were no fatalities, al
though there were many wet feet.
Most of them have passed the test
and are eligible to become "full-
Hedged" members of the Los Angeles
Chamber of Commerce.
The "mist" which hit the Farm Fri
day night was .stopped for a few
hours during the game Saturday, by
special request of the 13.A.C. to Jupl
- Pluvius. but only long enough
for the game to be played and to
enable the fans to get home.
