# Subs Rout Olympics; New Power Ready For Big Game Test
## Reserves Bolster Regulars To Thwart Upset With Six Touchdowns PEAK IN PLAY LOOMS Passes, Runs Score After Lazy First Half 
### Millard Browne 
Stanford will reach a new peak of
gridiron perfection next Saturday
when the Indians meet California's
Golden Bears.
"Gwan, that new peak stuff is
getting tiresome," say you. But it
looks like straight dope this time.
Stanford defeated a weak Olympic
Club team 40 to 0 Saturday. And
they defeated them in a contest that
brought out several new angles.
Strong Reserves
It proved that Tiny Thornhill has
more than just a first-string team.
The so-called "forgotten men"
played last Saturday, and Thornhill
kept trotting out second, third, and
fourth stringers, v/ho played top
notch football.
The stage was all set for a real,
honest-to-goodness upset. The club
men, who scored on Santa Clara and
held U.S.F. to six points, were going
to slip over a touchdown, and then
hold the unenthused Stanford team.
The Cardinals were going to play
without the services of Bobby Gray
son, Woody Adams, and Bob Black,
and that was figured to help in the
upset. Then the wet field was going
to get the Stanford running attack
all tangled up.
Game Becomes Rout
It was an ideal plot and would
have made fine reading in all of the
New York papers; yes, and in the
Los Angeles journals, too.
But here come the blundering
Redskins and miss the cue. They
caught on vaguely in the first half
and scored only one touchdown.
Then the second, third, and fourth
stringers went in. They completely
missed the idea and turned a peace
ful game of football into a rout.
Forty to nothing the scoreboard read
as the game ended with Stanford on
the Club five-yard line and going
right after some more points.
The Indians loafed through the
first half, tested out their running
attack for two steady drives in the
third period just to be sure it was
still working, and then tried out
some passes that met with success.
Club Penalty Helps
After Alustiza had put the Club
in a hole by kicking out of bounds
on the three-yard line, Stanford
opened her thrust for the first score.
The Indians took the ball on the 30,
gained eleven and a first down, and
then the Club was penalized 15
yards to the four-yard line. On the
second play, Gordy Head, playing
at right half in place of Bones Ham
ilton, went over on a reverse. Mos
crip place-kicked the point.
In the third period, Stanford took
a punt on her 30, and romped
through four first downs to the goal
70 yards away in ten tries, with
Alustiza finally going over from the
two-yard line. Playing in Gray
son's old fullback role, Alustiza fea
tured the drive, with Buck Van
Dellen and Hamilton adding one
nice gain each. Moscrip's extra point
made the score 14 to 0.
Third Score
A few moments later the Indians
launched another ten-play spurt
that ended in the same manner
with Alustiza driving over from the
two and Moscrip kicking the goal.
This second drive opened on the
Olympic Club 46-yard line.
It was in the fourth quarter that
(he Stanford passing attack received
its first test. Two first downs from
running plays put the Cards on the
