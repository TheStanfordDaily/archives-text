# The 						Blue Beagle Again, In the Movies This Time
## 
### 
The desperate, cruel, hard-hearted, villain
ous villain of yesterday was never hissed or
hooed more consistently than is the following
little announcement that is Hashed upon the
screen as a polite introduction to each super
super opus in the local llieker palaces today.
This Picture Approved by the Product ion
(lode Administration of the Motion Picture
Producers mid Distributors of America.

True, most of the hoys who arouse them
selves sufficiently between pictures to open
their eyes for a few seconds and gaze in com
plete boredom at the useless proclamation
do their hissing in good fun. Having caught
thessprit of the thing, they find it a part of the
pleasure of going to the show by being able
To revive the Bronx rooting section when
scholastic work demands recreation.
The picture, it seems, is "approved" by a
board of Hollywood demagogues who make
il their#business to see that the production
is morally "satisfactory," that il need not be
goody-goody, but must eliminate the un
necessary pornographic sequences. Further
more, the cerlilicate indicates that the pro
ducer acted in accordance with the NRA.
It is all right, if the NRA must be permitted
to tell everybody what to do, to see that all
cinematic entertainment is handled in ac
cordance with the rules of - fair competition,
theoretically the basic factor.in the NRA struc
ture. II is, furthermore, something to which
we cannot object, if the producers themselves
get together and set up a fair and impartial
board of censorship to regulate their own
industry.
Rut il is totally unfair to Ihe patrons of
the modern theatre, the little fellow who must
dig deep into his purse for the thirty-cent
balcony seat, to Hash for almost forty-live
seconds on the screen a declaration of purity,
popularity, or anything else that could only
become monotonous with continued repeti
tion. He resents it, quite naturally, for the
censorship implied, ralher than for any real
objection to the NRA itself.
Some species of a National Code Authority
should spare a few seconds to issue the procla
mation that, as long as every motion picture
studio is a member of the NRA and adheres
lo its regulations, future productions can
content themselves with a mere display of
the blue eagle itself in a corner of the title
announcement, and let il go at that.

Producers mid Distributors of America.
Certificate Xumber
True, most of the hoys who arouse them
selves sufficiently between pictures to open
their eyes for a few seconds and gaze in com
plete boredom at the useless proclamation
do their hissing in good fun. Having caught
thessprit of the thing, they find it a part of the
pleasure of going to the show by being able
To revive the Bronx rooting section when
scholastic work demands recreation.
The picture, it seems, is "approved" by a
board of Hollywood demagogues who make
il their#business to see that the production
is morally "satisfactory," that il need not be
goody-goody, but must eliminate the un
necessary pornographic sequences. Further
more, the cerlilicate indicates that the pro
ducer acted in accordance with the NRA.
It is all right, if the NRA must be permitted
to tell everybody what to do, to see that all
cinematic entertainment is handled in ac
cordance with the rules of - fair competition,
theoretically the basic factor.in the NRA struc
ture. II is, furthermore, something to which
we cannot object, if the producers themselves
get together and set up a fair and impartial
board of censorship to regulate their own
industry.
Rut il is totally unfair to Ihe patrons of
the modern theatre, the little fellow who must
dig deep into his purse for the thirty-cent
balcony seat, to Hash for almost forty-live
seconds on the screen a declaration of purity,
popularity, or anything else that could only
become monotonous with continued repeti
tion. He resents it, quite naturally, for the
censorship implied, ralher than for any real
objection to the NRA itself.
Some species of a National Code Authority
should spare a few seconds to issue the procla
mation that, as long as every motion picture
studio is a member of the NRA and adheres
lo its regulations, future productions can
content themselves with a mere display of
the blue eagle itself in a corner of the title
announcement, and let il go at that.
