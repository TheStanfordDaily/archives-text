# An Interesting Situation
## 
### 
While the pressure of public opinion thai
many think convicted David Lamson now
swings sharply toward a belief in his inno
cence, the officials of Santa Clara county still
ponder over Ihe (piestion of what to do about
the case.
Present indications are that the prosecution
will ask for a new trial, while the (piestion
of whether to release Lamson on bail in the
interim still hangs lire. Both questions will
be settled when Lamson appears on Novem
ber .'JO before the court that convicted him.
So-called startling allegations laid before
the District Attorney last Tuesday constitute
the basis for the new trial, li thesc charges are
startling or of any validity whatsoever then
a new trial is justified. It they prove to be
nothing more than a thin pretext for holding
another expensive and nerve-wracking trial
based on evidence that has 110 worth, then
Santa Clara county and American justice
both seem destined for a further nose-dive
into the mire of public disapproval.
As a result of eight months' investigation
by the social service commission of the State
federation of Churches, a crusade in Lam
son's behalf has been started by Ihe ministers
111 the state. Here, though, .is in the midsum
mer of 11KM, we need to be wary of Ihe effects
of fickle public opinion.
Metier by far for Santa Clara county's offi
cials to follow the dictates of pure reason. If

there is any new evidence then another trial
is the only logical course. But it should not
he called merely to satisfy that mania of
American prosecutors, the desire for a con
vict ion.
Meanwhile David Lainson, center of the
controversy, maintains his customary philo
sophic calm. It the eventual and final settle
ment of the case is of intense concern to
thousands of people, what must it he to him?
