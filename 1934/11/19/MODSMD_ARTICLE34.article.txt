# Sane National Planning
## 
### 
It is heartening to lind that there are some
times honest men and women who can escape
from self-interest and blind prejudice sulli
ciently Jong to make more than a gesture
toward seeking the truth. That the Federal
government's national planning hoard is such
a group, is suggested hv its report, made
puhlic last week, on the possibilities of im
proving American life through economic co
ordination.
The board did not in helter-skelter fashion
denounce all sovietism, fascism, nazism, and
like "isms" as being downright contrary to
the Constitution and all established American
practices. The board, squarely recognizing
that a critical situation exists, could forbear
any jettison of possibilities on mere emotional
grounds.
The board did report that none of the
schemes was practicable; not because they
were at variance with the existing order, but
because they are not adaptable to our peculiar
problems. The board was sane enough to
understand that the threat to civil peace lies
not in "Red" machinations, but in the "Con
ditions . . . which great masses of people will
not tolerate and should not be expected to
tolerate over any considerable period of lime."
To those recalcitrants who object to experi
mental changes with "American institutions"
the board was forthright enough to warn thai
"Not passive acceptance, but violent explosion
is the alternative if we fail to develop security
and progress by 'rational and evolutionary
methods."
The board does not suggest that planning
will end all ourVulmenls, but it clearly under
stands that the nation's economic security
can no longer be left in the hands of private
business alone. It feels that a method of co
ordination and long-range planning will lead
to a better American society than we at pres
ent enjoy.
It would be valuable if every "Red" baiting
educator, and every "Red" scared newspaper
editor could study the planning board's com
plete report and pattern after it in the appli
cation of sane rationality to the disturbing
economic problems of the day.
