Stanford won, Cal won, Navy and Princeton
lost, and thus we enter the annual live days
of preparation that mark the hours preceding
193.Vs Rear meat barbecue.
Rig Came rally, torchlight parade, bonfire,
and accompanying enthusiasm make the sky
the limit Wednesday; Big Came jolly-up, all-
University event that features a popular Pa
cific Coast musical aggregation, comes Thurs
day afternoon; the Caielies, musical festivities
for the Farm, Friday night, followed by an
all-University dance—and there's a certain
gridiron contest over Berkeley way on Satur
day afternoon, that promises to provide ample
thrills and chills.
If you plan to have yourself a swell (uh
huh) time, take advantage of all that is of
fered, and get the scholastic necessities out
of the way first. II is a big week. And the Big
Came is just that—sixty minutes of it.
