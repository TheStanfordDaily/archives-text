### CEDRIC LARSON 
Professor Albert L. Guerard, an authority on mod
ern France, sees in the recent political upheaval of
France a manifestation of the universal unrest which
seethes in Europe.
Hostile Armistice Day demonstrations were made
against former Premier Edouard Herriot, blamed by
some for the overthrow of the recent cabinet of Gaston
Doumergue. Doumergue was loudly acclaimed by
thousands of nationalists who gathered in front of his
Paris residence after the Armistice Day parade. So
cialists, Communists, Anti-Fascists and other leftist
groups held counter demonstrations.
Pierrc-Etienne Flandin, the new six-foot-Sour
premier, is a Republican of the left. lie is the tall
est and youngest premier than France has had. His
coalition cabinet received last week a 4215 to lIS
vote of confidence by the Chamber of Deputies.
Flandin has promised France both to fight dicta
torship and revolution. He aims for "a progressive
return to economic liberty, organized and defended
—not planned economy." Leon Blum, the Socialist
leader, has been the political foe of Flandin.
Professor Guerard believes that the recent ripple
of disturbance which ran through France does not quite
correspond with the deep-seated causes of discontent.
"We are not quite fair to the ruling party, the
Radical Socialists. Because there are violent mani
festations against them, we believe they must be
wrong. It might simply prove that their opponents are
bad losers, and use methods of violence.
"The Stavinsky scandal or the general discon
tent with French parliamentary methods arc not
(he real causes of the present disturbances. The
trouble is world-wide economic maladjustment
and fear of war. Every country feels that it is
suffering from an illness special to itself. This is a
delusion. The sickness is the same throughout
Europe.
"In a city like Paris with 5,000,000 inhabitants,''
states Professor Guerard, "it is an easy matter to raise
a throng of people to besiege the doors of parliament,
which is situated in the very heart of the city. If the
seat of government were, for instance, removed to a
point twenty miles from Paris, demonstrations by
boulevard mobs would be obviated.
"I have absolutely no reason to believe that the
French people are against the Radical Socialist party,
which has been in control of France, sometimes by
coalition, for a third of a century. A Radical Socialist
is a Republican with leanings toward Socialism. An
ideal leader in the eyes of a Radical Socialist would be
President Franklin D. Roosevelt."

groups held counter demonstrations.
Pierrc-Etienne Flandin, the new six-foot-Sour
premier, is a Republican of the left. lie is the tall
est and youngest premier than France has had. His
coalition cabinet received last week a 4215 to lIS
vote of confidence by the Chamber of Deputies.
Flandin has promised France both to fight dicta
torship and revolution. He aims for "a progressive
return to economic liberty, organized and defended
—not planned economy." Leon Blum, the Socialist
leader, has been the political foe of Flandin.
Professor Guerard believes that the recent ripple
of disturbance which ran through France does not quite
correspond with the deep-seated causes of discontent.
"We are not quite fair to the ruling party, the
Radical Socialists. Because there are violent mani
festations against them, we believe they must be
wrong. It might simply prove that their opponents are
bad losers, and use methods of violence.
"The Stavinsky scandal or the general discon
tent with French parliamentary methods arc not
(he real causes of the present disturbances. The
trouble is world-wide economic maladjustment
and fear of war. Every country feels that it is
suffering from an illness special to itself. This is a
delusion. The sickness is the same throughout
Europe.
"In a city like Paris with 5,000,000 inhabitants,''
states Professor Guerard, "it is an easy matter to raise
a throng of people to besiege the doors of parliament,
which is situated in the very heart of the city. If the
seat of government were, for instance, removed to a
point twenty miles from Paris, demonstrations by
boulevard mobs would be obviated.
"I have absolutely no reason to believe that the
French people are against the Radical Socialist party,
which has been in control of France, sometimes by
coalition, for a third of a century. A Radical Socialist
is a Republican with leanings toward Socialism. An
ideal leader in the eyes of a Radical Socialist would be
President Franklin D. Roosevelt."
Professor Albert L. Guerard, an authority on mod
ern France, sees in the recent political upheaval of
France a manifestation of the universal unrest which
seethes in Europe.
Hostile Armistice Day demonstrations were made
against former Premier Edouard Herriot, blamed by
some for the overthrow of the recent cabinet of Gaston
Doumergue. Doumergue was loudly acclaimed by
thousands of nationalists who gathered in front of his
Paris residence after the Armistice Day parade. So
cialists, Communists, Anti-Fascists and other leftist
groups held counter demonstrations.
