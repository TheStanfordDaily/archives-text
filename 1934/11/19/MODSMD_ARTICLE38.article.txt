# BULL SESSION
## SHOULD GIRLS LEAVE HOME? 
### 
Ever since the snake-apple fiasco
in the Garden of Eden, women have
been getting themselves and their
friends into trouble. Helen did it;
Cleo did it; Pandora did it; Carrie

Nation did it in
another way. They
have been a de
lightful and troub
lesome lot, a deli
cious agony, a glo
rious mistake, or
what have you.
Stanford also has
some women, more
and merrier every
quarter. There are

few Helens an less Carrie Nations.
But they are here, with all the glory
that was Hollywood and the gran
deur that was Mills. They simply
cannot be disregarded. They pre
sent problems. Stanford men and
the Women's Conference are at
tempting to solve those problems—
which is good fun for all concerned.

Women's Conference has decreed
that overnight leaves for frosh
women—though they be to go home
—shall count as 2:3o's. Further, the
first-year dears may have but one
week-end 2:30 leave per week, plus
five "floating" 2:3o's distributed or
"floated'' over the whole of the
quarter. That is the set-up, and
frosh women are taking it.
That means if a timorous little
freshman woman wants to spend
Friday, Saturday, and Sunday nights
in the bosom of her family, she is
docked as heavily as though she
were out on a trio of bubbling,
booming 2:3o's. That means thai
the five "floating" 2:3o's will soon
have floated away, and the timorous
little freshman woman is left
stranded on the Farm whether she
likes it or no.

That means if a fast frosh woman
chooses to rest up with a week-end
on the family fireside, she rests at
the peril of losing a large slice of
her late dates. She is penalized for
spending the week-end with mom
ma and poppa as heavily as she is
set back for dashing hither and yon
on a series of 2:30 escapades. If that
system is right, there are many
on the campus who don't know
from nothing.
It has been the policy of the Uni
versity to keep Stanford women out
of as much trouble as possible.
Hence the social regulations. Though
that policy may be considered a pol
icy of "babying" women who should
knew enough, it has been firmly
fixed as the administration's atti
tude. But now comes a system that
makes it hard for the "home" girls.
Girls who would prefer to make
their adjustment to University life
.'■lowly are "stuck" on the Farm,
torn from the family ties.

Yes, frosh women coached by
Corridor Captains may consent to
such a scheme. But ihc little lambs
are being shorn by their shepherds.

have been a de
lightful and troub
lesome lot, a deli
cious agony, a glo
rious mistake, or
what have you.
Stanford also has
some women, more
and merrier every
quarter. There are

few Helens an less Carrie Nations.
But they are here, with all the glory
that was Hollywood and the gran
deur that was Mills. They simply
cannot be disregarded. They pre
sent problems. Stanford men and
the Women's Conference are at
tempting to solve those problems—
which is good fun for all concerned.

Women's Conference has decreed
that overnight leaves for frosh
women—though they be to go home
—shall count as 2:3o's. Further, the
first-year dears may have but one
week-end 2:30 leave per week, plus
five "floating" 2:3o's distributed or
"floated'' over the whole of the
quarter. That is the set-up, and
frosh women are taking it.
That means if a timorous little
freshman woman wants to spend
Friday, Saturday, and Sunday nights
in the bosom of her family, she is
docked as heavily as though she
were out on a trio of bubbling,
booming 2:3o's. That means thai
the five "floating" 2:3o's will soon
have floated away, and the timorous
little freshman woman is left
stranded on the Farm whether she
likes it or no.

That means if a fast frosh woman
chooses to rest up with a week-end
on the family fireside, she rests at
the peril of losing a large slice of
her late dates. She is penalized for
spending the week-end with mom
ma and poppa as heavily as she is
set back for dashing hither and yon
on a series of 2:30 escapades. If that
system is right, there are many
on the campus who don't know
from nothing.
It has been the policy of the Uni
versity to keep Stanford women out
of as much trouble as possible.
Hence the social regulations. Though
that policy may be considered a pol
icy of "babying" women who should
knew enough, it has been firmly
fixed as the administration's atti
tude. But now comes a system that
makes it hard for the "home" girls.
Girls who would prefer to make
their adjustment to University life
.'■lowly are "stuck" on the Farm,
torn from the family ties.

Yes, frosh women coached by
Corridor Captains may consent to
such a scheme. But ihc little lambs
are being shorn by their shepherds.

Ever since the snake-apple fiasco
in the Garden of Eden, women have
been getting themselves and their
friends into trouble. Helen did it;
Cleo did it; Pandora did it; Carrie

Nation did it in
another way. They
have been a de
lightful and troub
lesome lot, a deli
