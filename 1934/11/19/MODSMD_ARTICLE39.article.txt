At the Varsity

A typically Crawford - Gable ro
mance is centered around the fact 1
lhat Crawford's pre-Gable love |
(Otto Kruger) happens to be mar- j
ried, although he later gets a di-

vorce, and she
marries him, his
money, and so
cial position, out
of pity and kind
ness.
Gable, "whom
she nobly re- j
fuses, leaves his I

Argentine ranch and corses to New !
York, where things are finally hap- !
pily ended.
Amusing situations, swanky set- !
tings, and Stuart Erwin wit make j
this a pleasing picture. —Ahrens.
