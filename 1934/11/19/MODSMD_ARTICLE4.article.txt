## Rev. Rowe Speaks in Chapel On Missionary Life 
### Zoe Ann Hill 
How he helped teach thousands
of cheerful, superstitious Eskimos
the ways and beliefs of civilization
v/as described in chapel services
yesterday by the Rt. Rev. Peter
Trimble Rowe, 76-year-old veteran
missionary and Bishop of Alaska.
Already a resident of Alaska
when the gold rush began in 1897,
Bishop Rowe said he had pleasant
recollections of the stampede, and of
meeting with the "stampeders"
around their campfires.
Winters Rigorous
The rigors of an Alaskan winter
will keep anyone at the peak of
physical fitness, Bishop Rowe re
marked. "Eternal vigilance is needed
to keep from freezing to death and
to ward off attacks by polar bears
in the north and wolves in the in
terior."
"Yet there were compensations,"
Bishop Rowe reflected. "In the great
white silence, with the Northern
Lights blazing, one cannot help but
feel religious."
The missionary spoke highly of
Herbert Hoover, who as Secretary
of Commerce aided Rowe's work in
the territory.
Pioneers in Work
The bishop and his associates were
pioneers in Alaskan missionary
work. Hospitals, schools, and
churches were developed under their
direction, with the help of several
famous characters of the North.
The notorious "Soapy" Smith con
tributed heavily to the building of
Bishop Rowe's first hospital in
Skagway, Dr. Rowe said.
