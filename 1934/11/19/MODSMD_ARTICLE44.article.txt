### Roger Kimball 
Gaining an early lead, falling be
hind, and then staging a victorious
comeback, Stanford's varsity water
polo team nosed out the Olympic:
Club, 8 to G, in two extra periods
Saturday afternoon in Eneina pool.
The, powerful club team was
prepared for the .scoring thrusts of
two great Stanford forwards, Cap
tain Leo Cook and Vlad Taranik,
and succeeded in holding Cook to
three goals and stopping Taranik
scoreless. Bob Foster, loss feared
than his two mate:;, sneaked in for
five goals while playing his best
game to date.
Cards Take Lead
In the midst of rough play at the
start of the game, Foster made a
shot from the side to give the Indians
their initial advantage. Shortly af
terward, ho fired another beauty
from a wild scramble near the
Winged "O" goal, and Nort Thorn
ton's champions were in front, 2 to 0.
In spite of the number of dead
eye shots in the game, scores were
few in the first half, because of the
vise-like guarding employed by both
teams.: After Bill Woodard of Stan
ford and Sehultz of the clubmen had
been thrown out of the game for un
necessary roughness, Paul De Silva,
Card ace of last year, gave the
Olympians their first goal with a
clever .shot from close in.
Wiget Meets Wigct
Wally Wiget, Indian guard, and
his big brother, Ted, who won nearly
everything in the books for Stan
ford in 1032 and 1933, engaged in
furious combat throughout the game,
much to the enjoyment of the 2,000
fans present. With Ted out of the
game for a few seconds, the Cardi
nals broke through the club de
fense, .end Cook made a fast shot
good to put Stanford in possession
of a 3~i lead.
Another covr.c >: shot by Foster and
some great stops by Goalie Bob Has
lacher't,brought the first half to a
close, with Nort Thornton's league
leading team ahead by a margin of
4 to 1?'
jjOlympians Tie Score
The clubmen, flashing their real
strengtjj, scored twicc in the first
few minutes of the second half on
shots bv De Silva and Ted Wiget.
They tied the score at 4-all just
before! the end of the regular play
ing titrne as Ted rammed the ball
into the goal in spite of strong de
fensive play by Stanford.
During this half the Indians had
troubii in getting their attack to
function, and the men of the
Winged "O ' played like the Olym
pic Games veterans that fiv? of them
are.
De Silva Scores
Do Silva pu' the Olympians in the
lead in the first extra period with
his fourth goJil of the game, but Leo
Cook tied il up again, and soon fol
lowed with another of his unstop
pable efforts,-to give Stanford a 6
to 5 lead as the second overtime
session opened, with the teams
swapping goals. Almost without de
lay, Dc Silva, who co-starred with
Foster, offensively, knotted the count
once more for the clubmen.
Foster was not to be outdone, and
fired two bullet-like shots into the
club net within the final minute to
save the Cards' undefeated record,
assure them of first place in the
league standings for at least another
week, and extend their string of
consecutive victories to 19.
Entire Team Stars
Foster, Cook, Wally Wiget, and
Bob Haslacher starred for the In
dians, although they all played well,
including Jimmy Bcnet, Bill Wood
ard. Bob Sutherland, and Bill Clemo.
Paul be Silva and Ted Wiget, who

gained an even break with his
brother and rival, looked best for
the Olympians.
Stanford and the Olympic Club
will meet again Wednesday night, in
San Francisco, and the Cards and
Bears tangle Saturday at Berkeley.
