# SIDELINE SLANTS..
## GAME DIDN'T PROVE ANYTHING 
### 
From the standpoint of showing
any new Stanford prowess or giv
ing away any Stanford weaknesses,
the Olympic Club game Saturday
may just as well not have been
j scheduled.
The Cardinal running attack was
I given a few trials, but everyone
! agrees the Indians have a running
attack that will buzz right along.
Stanford did open up with a few
passes at the last, but they were
! against a Club team which was so
i tired that it could not be called a
test of Stanford passing.
So the Cards now claim only what
they did before the game, cxcept
that they now have eight victories
to their credit instead of only seven,
and they have but one more chance
of being beaten during the regular
! schedule instead of two. The In
; dians still have a sensational power
a'tack and unpenetrable defense, but
| must still prove to the skeptical that
i they can pass.
