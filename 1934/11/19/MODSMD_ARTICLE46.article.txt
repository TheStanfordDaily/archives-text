# THEY'RE FINALLY STAGING A COMEBACK
## 
### 
It looks like a couple of the crip
ples have thrown away their crutch
es and begun to ramble.
Howard Jones and his Southern
Californians finally opened up and
gave the customers a glimpse of the
glory that was old Troy by thunder
ing through Oregon, the team that
tied with Stanford, and the Trojans
incidentally,, for the 1933 Pacific
Coast Conference crown, 33 to 0.
It was Haskell Wotkyns who fur
nished the ball-carrying spark, and
Ail-American Cotton Warburton
still remained unheard from.
California, those Golden Bears
who meet Stanford next week, made
it two in a row and a not-at-all-bad
conference showing in their scoring
orgy with Idaho, 45 to 13. Just as it
was with Washington, so it was with
the Vandals that the Bear goal was
crossed via the aerial route. Bill
Ingram's Californians finally gave a
glimmering of the power that has
been claimed for them all year.
INDIANS, GOPHERS
STILL STAND OUT
If Stanford wins the Big Game, it
looks like Stanford will have to play
Minnesota before there is more than
a 50 per cent agreement as to which
team is.the best in the country. All
the rest of the important ones haVe
been steadily falling by the wayside
as the Cards and Gophers pile up
.scores and victories over the best
opposition in their respective sec
tions.
That would be one Rose Bowl
game that would call for a capacity
attendance, rain or shine. Come on
Gophers, let's do something about
that Big Ten ruling. First of all,
come on Stanford, let's do some
thing about the Big Game.
