Santa Clara entered their game with St. Mary's yesterday as favor
ites, for the first time in many years. After the players did everything
but swim for two hours, St. Mary's eked out a 7-1) win. However, the
number of fumbles, yardage lost by both teams on penalties for holding,
clipping, etc., made the "little Big Game" look like a mud fight. Left is
