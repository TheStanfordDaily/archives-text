# Frosh Debate S.F. High Tonight On Health Topic
## 
### 
Making their first appearance on
the campus the freshman debaters
will meet Lowell high tonight at
7:30 o'clock in the Women's Club
house. Bob Hartman, Carl Barrow
and Bill Clayton will represent the
team.
The team will take the negative
of the question of compulsory health
insurance. That President Wilbur is
one of the chief advocates of com
pulsory health insurance should
make the debate more interesting.
