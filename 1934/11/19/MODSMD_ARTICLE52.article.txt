# "Pudding Stone" Base Perils Bridge, Is Charge
## 
### 
According to a San Francisco pa-
I per, Dr. Bailey Willis, professor of
geology at Stanford, suggests a trial
by jury for the Golden Gate Bridge.
In a long brief, Dr. Willis sub
mitted his arguments for declaring
the south pier will rest on a "pud
ding" foundation. "The question is
whether a pudding stone, which con
sists of hard boulders in a soft,
j weak matrix, is a proper foundation
! for a rigid concrete block that is to
carry a great weight," the professor
' states.
