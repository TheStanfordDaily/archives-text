# CAMPUS OPINION
## 
### 
| The Editor, Sir:
Putting into efTect the proposed!
| policy of opposition to football !
i broadcasts would elicit considerable
comment from an otherwise reti
cent alumni.
Most alumni are sufficiently in
terested in the games to listen to
J the broadcasts. A great majority of
j these same listeners could not at- j
tend the games if they wished, ir
j respective of any pecuniary deter- j
I rent, because of occupational inter- :
i ference.
From the students' standpoint,
i only a very small percentage could !
; attend off-campus games. At the j
U.C.L.A. game November 3 our
j rooting section (including a sprink- j
! ling of alumni) certainly didn't con- j
| stitute over 10 per cent of the un- |
; dergraduates. Think what an at
tendance we would have in Seattle.
Then think how many students
would be deprived of the privilege
I of hearing the Washington game if
the proposal were adopted.
Sincerely,
H.C.T., '31.
! China, which once supplied 86 j
; per cent of the world's tea, supplies j
j but 20 per cent now.
