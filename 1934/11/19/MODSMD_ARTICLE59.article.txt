## 
### 
Who should come waltzing into I
the Daily office yesterday but Sybil !
Drofnats, sister to the Drofnats boys, |
| and women's wear salesgirl at the j
j "five and ten."
"I'm all a-twitter," said Sybil, not 1
1 a whit undaunted by the icy stares |
of the Ray, mad youths that thronged j
j the office. "Brother Joe is in the j
' hospital, and Sylvestre is in jail.
; And it's so much fun."
"What's the matter?" sang out the |
sports editor, with tears in his eyes. !
"Sylvestre Went alter Joe with a j
cleaver when he read what Joe had
written about him in Friday's paper.
Ma called the cops. She said she
wasn't going to have any of those j
love nest murders in our house.
Sylvestre Too Leaky
"They took Sylvestre J. to the;
jug and pieced Joe together and got j
I him to the hospital. We tried to bail j
1 Sylvestre out, but he had sprung j
| too many leaks."
"You'd better leave him in jail," :
I said the sports editor, trying to be
j brave. "After all the hutches he I
i made on Saturday's scores, people ;
j are ready to lynyh him." '

I "Is there anything wrong?"
"He predicted Oregon to beat
| S.C."
"Yeh, I know. He told me to ask i
i you to pardon his southern acei- '
1 dent."
"And he predieted Syracuse to'
beat Colgate."
"Syracuse found out it was no
soap."
"And he said Princeton would take
| Yale."
"Yale got a headlock on them and
! threw the key away."
60 Per Cent for Sylvcstre
"He only got 60 per cent on his
I total predictions."
"Well, look how wild people were !
I about 3.2 per cent when it came out."
"I'm just that much wilder about |
; his 60."
| "Oh, you old nasty, I'll bet you're
1 the guy who started all this 'surly
i to be and surly to rise' business."
At this point in the conversation, i
I some reporter opened the window i
and Sybil accidentally fell out. "I'll
! get even with you for this."
"Even, nothing, you can have
1 odds," said the old man.
