# OFFICIALS CANCEL U.C.-CARD SOCCER GAME: WET FIELD
## 
### 
No soccer games were played
Saturday.
Reason: Rain fell on Stanford
Farm.
The Golden Bear was all set
to tangle with the Cards in the
first of their annual series
matches but such a deluge
struck the playing field the
night before the tilt that a soc
cer game played on it would
have turned into a mud battle.
Officials took one look at the
grounds Saturday morning,
thought of the Rose Bowl, and
called the game off.
Harry Maloney, Indian coach,
is negotiating with Cal to play
the postponed game on a Wed
nesday.
