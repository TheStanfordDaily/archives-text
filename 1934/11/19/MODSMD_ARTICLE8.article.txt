# GAELS CONQUER BRONCS IN MUD
## Third Period Blocked Kick Results in 7-0 Win 
### 
KEZAR STADIUM, SAN FRAN- j
CISCO, Nov. 18 (VP).â€”ln a downpour j
so bitter that even Kezar's usual j
quota pi seagulls got disgusted and |
headed for shelter, the Gaels of St. i
Mary's mudded their way to a 7 to 0 j
victory over Santa Clara's Broncos I
here today.
The fans, however, were made of ;
stronger stuff and more than half of >
the original crowd of 60,000 stuck
around to see the Gaels get the game- |
winning break late in the third pe- '
riod.
Fiese's punt went out of bounds j
on the Bronco four-yard line and |
Sobrero, Bronc half, went back to I
punt out. He fumbled the wet ball t
and Pennino, Gael end, came through j
to fall on the ball behind the goal i
line.
Gael fumbles in the first half gave i
Santa Clara three chances to score, j
but each time penalties or the stout
Gael defense halted the threat. The
Gael win tumbled the Broncs out of
the nation's undefeated class.
Neither team was able to make i
more than one first down as they '
fought their way up and down the
muddy, rain-soaked field in a down- j
pour that continued throughout the
game.
