## 
### 
I
The perplexing problem of "Just
how to aci on Big Game Night" will*
be settled once and for all Thursday
morning at the break of dawn, when (
Chaparral appears on the Quad.
Editor Gordon Steedman has set
tled many other "real, life prob
lems" in the Big Game Issue of
Chaparral, including the perplexi- j
ties that face coaches in making
statements to the press. The "Spe
cial Statement Service for Football
Coaches" is a definite contribution
to .scientific thought in this field.
The big, 44-page issue will be de- I
voted exclusively to the Big Game i
and football. The issue will feature
more â€¢ short gags and quips, more 1
pictures and cartoons, and the usual)
amount of poetry and prose.
