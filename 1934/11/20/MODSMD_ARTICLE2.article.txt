# Chappie Issues Big Number For Big Game
## 
### 
''Although it will electrify many
people, there will be no cover charge
to the Big Game Issue of Chappie,"
says Old Boy Gordon Steedman,
"but inside there will be a battery
of jokes, quips, cartoons, and pic
tures."
The outstanding cover drawn by
young Junior Gist is one of the
most outstanding of outstanding
covers. "It is outstanding," says
Gilman Gist, Jr.
Some of the boys who are doing
the undercover work are: Frank
Cady, Bob Hartmann, Irvin Jorgen
sen, Curtis Prendcrgast, and Hart
Preston, literary; and Rollin Pick
ford, Dick Dawson, Gilman Gist,
Dick Stark. Bob Gillespie, Curtis
Barnes, and Page Gilman, art. Many
of these bright and shining lads are
new to Chappie readers, while oth
ers are among the old favorites.
"This outsanding issue may be had
for the price of 15 cents per copy to
morrow morning," hints Everett
Claiborne, Chappie manager.
