# GENETIC IDEALS TOLD ON RADIO
## Danforth Discusses Value Of Selective Heredity 
### 
Looking forward to a state in
which the handicap of an unfortu
nate inheritance would be removed
by marriages in successive genera- |
tions between the more highly phys- |
ically and mentally endowed, Dr. |
Charles H. Danforth touched upon I
thei popularly disputed question of j
heredity versus environment in his j
radio talk over station KGO at 8 j
o'clock last night.
The Stanford professor of anatomy j
said that nature, unguided, and act- !
ing through the genes, sometimes j
does suddenly bring to light in a new !
individual latent capabilities not j
realized during many previous gen- |
erations, thereby permitting us to |
glimpse the kind of man that might, !
if we chose to have it so, prevail on I
the earth.

"In any event," said Professor j
Danforth, "it is not a matter of j
heredity versus environment, but ]
heredity and environment —although j
it might be added that in the final j
analysis heredity does set limits for
even the most plastic trait. It may
be recalled that one's genetic con
stitution comprises all the poten- \
tialities — mediated through the j
genes—which he receives from his |
parents and which he may transmit j
to his offspring."
How far these potentialities will I
be realized depends upon internal ;
interaction and the effects of diverse
environmental factors. In some cases j
the effect of a particular genie com- j
plex on the mind or body is rather j
rigidly predetermined. When there
is found to be considerable plasticity, j
one may hope that an unfavorable j
trait may be improved by care and ,
treatment.
Future Trend
With the help of medicine and an 1
heredity-conscious people, a bold J
optimist call foresee a nation with
universal guarding against inherited I
disease, or one which, because of i
hereditary immunities, would have
no need for any prevention what- j
ever.
