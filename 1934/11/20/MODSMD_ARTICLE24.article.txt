# EXTRA DOLLAR PLAN GOES TO EX-COMMITTEE
## Kahn Thinks Prompt Move Will Hasten Start Of Theatre Building WILBUR OKAYS L.I.D. Useless Honor Societies' Fate on Schedule 
### 
A.S.S.U. President Marvie Kahn
will suggest to Ex Committee in its
meeting tonight lhat the one dollar
theatre fund fee be added to tuition
and community fees, starting winter
quarter.
Kahn thinks that the fee should
be added to tuition whether or not
actual construction has been ordered
by winter quarter. This action would,
in his opinion, be bound to hasten
work on the new structure.
Other Matters
Four other matters are on Kahn's
schedule for tonight's meeting: the
petition of the League for Industrial
Democracy for official sanction; a
technicality in regard to last year's
election of Julius Jacobs as Rally
Committee chairman; the proposal to
buy a concert grand piano left on
the campus last year by Giesecke;
arid the question of abolishing some
useless honor societies.
President Wilbur has replied fa
vorably to the L.I.D. petition. A
liberal group for the discussion and
furthei'ance of socialistic and paci
fistic views, the league has a mem
bership of 15 students on the campus
and holds its meetings in the Po
litical Science Building. A Stanford
chapter has been in existence on the
campus off and on during the past
few years.
The Baldwin concert grand piano
which Giesecke, famous pianist,
used in his appearance in the Con
cert Series last year is being offered
to the student body at a 75 per cent
reduction in price, according to
Kahn. The piano was loaned to the
Glee Club by the Baldwin company.
If purchased, the piano would be
used by the Glee Club, the Concert
Series, at dances, and at Glee Club
and orchestra performances.
