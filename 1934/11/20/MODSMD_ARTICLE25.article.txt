# Rush Period Starts Today
## 
### 
Today men's rushing begins again
in earnest.
At 11:30 o'clock freshmen will start
to trek up the Row, opening the sec
ond rushing period, which is to con
sist of two days, today and Thurs
day.
An important change in the rules
of last period is that a freshman may
accept only two, rather than three,
invitations to one house, as only four
meals are scheduled in the period.
No contact rules are still in ef
fect, except during the permitted
hours. No Row men in Encina and
only public contacts are the rules,
except during the coming Thanks
giving vacation when the Greeks
may take freshmen to the game at
Kezar Stadium, leaving Wednesday
morning. They may leave before
this time only with the permission
of the Interfraternity Council. There
is to be no on-campus rushing dur
ing this vacation.
The reason for the split period is
that Farm men are scheduled to
build the Big Game Bonfire on Wed
nesday.

The Montana Lumber Manufac
turers' Association reported its mills
cut more than 102.000.000 board feet
during 1933 and that shipments ex
ceeded the cut by one-fourth.
