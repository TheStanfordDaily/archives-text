# One Honor Society Of Each Type â€” ?
## 
### 
So-called honor societies have long been a
standing joke, not only at Stanford but on
nearly every college campus of the country.
It seems that in the past certain people got
together, organized a society, arbitrarily de
creed that it was to be honorary, and had a
merry time gratifying their own vanity. Once
I lie things started there seemed lo be no way
of getting rid of them. They simply lingered
on and on.
It's about time, though, for this seemingly
perpetual toleration of useless organizations
lo eease. Tonight Fx Committee can begin
the process of weeding them out. Their repre
sentative/ can he asked* lo appear and show
cause as to why these societies should be al
lowed to exist. If no good evidence is pre
sented, they should be eliminated.
There are at least two criteria by which
the existence of an honor society can he justi
fied. First of all it should he definitely proved
that membership is based upon some definite
accomplishment, as is the case with Phi Beta
Kappa. Then it should be shown that the
society does something of a constructive na
ture instead of merely collecting dues and
announcing a new pledge list from year to
year.
II the basis for selection to membership is
not clear lo an outsider, then Ihe term hono
rary is obviously a misnomer. Under such
circumstances, the organization lowers the
prestige of legitimate societies. 11 collects dues
and membership fees, fattening national
treasuries. People pay good money because
they mistakenly think that it is an honor to
belong to the group.
It would aid the cause of worthwhile hono
rary societies, clarify student organization
finances, and clear up a generally unpleasant
mess if a few of I hem were eliminated, leaving
one good organization in each field.
