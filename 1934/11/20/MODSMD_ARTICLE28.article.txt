# This San Francisco Sideshow
## 
### 
Better by far than any three-ring circus
that has hit the Bay Region smack in the
headlines in recent days is the sad excuse for
an explanation of why the San Francisco
Chronicle is publishing Upton Sinclair's own
slory of "How I Got Licked," that occupied
two columns of the front page of that news
paper <m Sunday.
During the so-called "campaign," editors
of that formerly patrician journal spent most
of their active hours gathering together all the
libelous material that could be contained in
one issue of any newspaper and used to tell
the world in general what a horrible goon was
this mug Sinclair.
The days of battle are over, now, and news
papers can settle down to the business of
making more money, forgetting the false and
superficial hatreds of yesterday. If Mr. Sin
clair can increase the Chronicle's circulation
by interest in his story of the political mad
house that possessed California, there seems
to be no reason why Sinclair and the Chronicle
should not rake in the profits.
But it is ridiculous for any purveyor of
information to vilify an individual in the
public prints until the opportunity for per
sonal gain enters the question, when the situ
ation is reversed and the worm not only turns,
but sits up and does tricks for the people.
Sinclair lost the race and now the Chronicle
prints stories which contain the defeated can
didate's personal reaction to the abhorrent,
mud-slinging campaign that was used to de
feat him. The Chronicle valiantly, if not gal
lantly, ballyhooed Merriani to the skies by lh<*
simple method of tearing Sinclair to bits, piece
by piece. Today the same newspaper oilers
choice quotations from the active EPIC leader
that are in no wise complimentary to the
paper or the governor.
"The Chronicle believes," say its editors,
"Ihut the people will be interested in knowing
what Mr. Sinclair is doing in of his own
statement that his group will continue to light
to put over the EPIC, plan."
A mighty weak excuse, when the catchword
"EXCLUSIVE" is blasted across the front
page to attract readers who arc interested in
Sinclair's ideas for what they are worth, read
ers who today will doubtless find n good deal
of interest in the articles, and who at the
next election will be forced to read more of
the same balogna in any repetition of the
19.'M fiasco.

to put over the EPIC, plan."
A mighty weak excuse, when the catchword
"EXCLUSIVE" is blasted across the front
page to attract readers who arc interested in
Sinclair's ideas for what they are worth, read
ers who today will doubtless find n good deal
of interest in the articles, and who at the
next election will be forced to read more of
the same balogna in any repetition of the
19.'M fiasco.
Better by far than any three-ring circus
that has hit the Bay Region smack in the
headlines in recent days is the sad excuse for
an explanation of why the San Francisco
Chronicle is publishing Upton Sinclair's own
slory of "How I Got Licked," that occupied
two columns of the front page of that news
paper <m Sunday.
During the so-called "campaign," editors
of that formerly patrician journal spent most
of their active hours gathering together all the
libelous material that could be contained in
one issue of any newspaper and used to tell
the world in general what a horrible goon was
this mug Sinclair.
The days of battle are over, now, and news
papers can settle down to the business of
making more money, forgetting the false and
superficial hatreds of yesterday. If Mr. Sin
clair can increase the Chronicle's circulation
by interest in his story of the political mad
house that possessed California, there seems
to be no reason why Sinclair and the Chronicle
should not rake in the profits.
But it is ridiculous for any purveyor of
information to vilify an individual in the
public prints until the opportunity for per
sonal gain enters the question, when the situ
ation is reversed and the worm not only turns,
but sits up and does tricks for the people.
Sinclair lost the race and now the Chronicle
prints stories which contain the defeated can
didate's personal reaction to the abhorrent,
mud-slinging campaign that was used to de
feat him. The Chronicle valiantly, if not gal
lantly, ballyhooed Merriani to the skies by lh<*
simple method of tearing Sinclair to bits, piece
by piece. Today the same newspaper oilers
choice quotations from the active EPIC leader
that are in no wise complimentary to the
paper or the governor.
"The Chronicle believes," say its editors,
"Ihut the people will be interested in knowing
what Mr. Sinclair is doing in of his own
statement that his group will continue to light
to put over the EPIC, plan."
A mighty weak excuse, when the catchword
"EXCLUSIVE" is blasted across the front
page to attract readers who arc interested in
Sinclair's ideas for what they are worth, read
ers who today will doubtless find n good deal
of interest in the articles, and who at the
next election will be forced to read more of
