President Dennett of Williams College is
a striking example of the round peg in the
square hole. II is no more lit for him to be
counselor and governing head of a group of

f ambitious young American men and women
i than it is for an oyster to wear overshoes.
When the I'.S. government asked Williams
. College to apply for its share of the FERA
1 money allotted to colleges and universities
for the relief of their needy students, Presi
dent Dennett look the request us an oppor
tunity to 11)4)ke a political speech.
He pointed out that such relief would M)
help the unfit to survive. "What is needed is
i fewer and better college graduates." (2) Col
leges would become permanently dependent
on Federal aid. "-41 would be better .... for
1 colleges to pare their budgets and go on a
I reduced enrollment basis."
Those statements sound dangerously like
1 academic snobbery. It is the sort of thing
that Stanford students, for instance, or any
other Pacific Coast university students would
not tolerate. It is the altitude of a reactionary,
rather than of a man who seeks to extend
learning and to burn the lamp of knowledge
in the dim corners.
It predicates the exploitation of the many
for the benefit of the few; it believes in the
necessity of class ignorance. It, if anything,
is distinctly un-American.
It is not the voice of an educator; it is the
growl of a sorehead.
