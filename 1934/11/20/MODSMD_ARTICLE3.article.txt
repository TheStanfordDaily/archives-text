# Students Join Together To Build Pyre For Big Game Rally Tomorrow
## Bonfire Head Entreats All To Bring Boxes Today For Use as Fuel 
### Loren Irwin 
Culminating two weeks of activity
in preparing for the Big Game Bon
fire, work today and tomorrow cen
ters around three events:
"Box day" today—all day.
All-University smoker tonight,
7:30 o'clock.
Big Game Bonfire — built and
burned tomorrow.
"Every member of the student
body bring a box of any descrip
tion or material, even to the lowly
shoe box, to the site of the bonfire
today," says Bob Jones, bonfire com
mittee chairman. "This will give
everyone a chance to see the tri
angular shaped skeleton framework
before the work begins, besides fur
nishing a foundation for the fire."
Foundation Soaked
Because of the current dampness
of the atmosphere, an infiamable
foundation is imperative to the suc
cess of the bonfire, since the wood
on hand has absorbed some of the
moisture.
Construction of the pyre will be
gin at 8 o'clock tomorrow morning,
continuing until 6 o'clock in the
evening. Trucks bringing wood all
day will furnish work to everyone
without morning classes.
At noon a lunch of sandwiches,
cookies, doughnuts, and candy will
be served to all workers by the
fairer sex, and cigarettes will be
passed out to workers throughout
the day.
The structure will be finished dur
ing the afternoon by students who
do not have classes.
To Use Announcer Car
Bill Waltman, bonfire committee
man, has arranged for an Associated
Oil car equipped with a broadcast
ing system to cruise around the cam
pus calling on those members of
the student body who voted for the
fire, but are not working, to do their
part in building the structure.
After the rally, which starts at
7:30 o'clock, virtually the whole
campus will trek to the bonfire £,ite
to watch the pyre burn, meanwhile
shouting defiance to California.
As a grand finale, an event never
before featured at former bonfires
will take place—a display of fire
works will light the sky as a final
gesture.
