# Let's Make Some Rules

A mellowed senior, veteran of sophomore
rushes on Encina, who knew mediocre foot
bull teams and the famed "500" as painful
actualities, not past history, looks upon the
new women with favor and amusement.
They feel their responsibility, do these gals.
They try hard' to please; they want to do
everything right, according to tradition, and
good taste, and sensibility. They are attempt
ing to adjust themselves to Stanford and ap
parently they sincerely hope that Stanford
will he proud of them—when Ihe adjustment
is made.
At present the women are much concerned
about the Palv-Campus transportation sys
tem. .lusl like the old rough, they are ad
verse to shelling out a dime for a ride when
they can avoid it. They cannot see why they
should not stand at the railroad gales and
wait their turn with the boys.
Which all brings up some very interesting
complications. Are men to pick up women
and are women to pick up the men? Are men
to pick up men only and women to pick up
women duly? If the latter is the case, are
sorority women to pick up freshmen and how
is this difficulty to be avoided?
What the women seem to want is a code
of behavior for their guidance, and we do
not doubt but they'll soon get it; and the
bus line shareholders will gel a pain in the
pocketbook.
