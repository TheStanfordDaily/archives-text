Secretary of Agriculture Henry A. Wallace, ad
ministration spokesman, last Thursday before the
Chicago Union League Club, an organization of com
mercial and industrial leaders, outlined the determined
fight that will be waged by President Franklin D.
Roosevelt in order to regain overseas markets.
The cabinet head stressed the need for a united
front by business and agriculture in working for an
upswing in the index-curve of America's exports.
"If you are in earnest about regaining world
trade," said Secretary Wallace, "I suggest that
you make common cause with agriculture and
station several men at every tariff hearing in
Washington to state forcibly their interest in hav
ing an increase in imports. To win back these
markets we must have an increase in the physical
volume of goods coming into this country."
Dr. Theodore H. Boggs, professor of economics and
an authority upon international trade, analyzes the
situation which confronts America with reference to
foreign commerce as follows:
"A fundamental truth which of late years has come
to enjoy a wider measure of popular recognition is
that in the long run a nation's exports, both visible
and invisible, can be no greater than its imports. From
this it follows that when the market in the United
States for foreign goods is narrowed by means of
tariffs, the United States thus renders it difficult for
foreigners to obtain the dollars with which to purchase
American goods.
"Unless foreign trade be restored on a large scale
the United States will derive but little profit from its
position as a leading creditor nation.
"It has been estimated by Secretary Wallace
that unless the trend toward economic isolation be
checked, from 40 to 100 millions of acres of Amer
ican agricultural land at present under cultivation
will have to be retired from use. This in turn will
necessitate shifting the millions of farmers and
tenants now occupying the surplus acreage to
regions where profitable employment may be found
for them. Cotton, corn, wheat, lard, beef and cer
tain other agricultural products cannot he helped
by tariffs for the reason that the United States
already produces these goods as cheaply or more
cheaply than other countries.
"There are various mass-production industries in
the United States which require markets abroad for
the most effective utilization of their productive ca
pacities. Unless trade be restoi'ed these industries
must undergo unwelcome readjustments.
"The same may be said of the shipping companies,
their investment and their employees. There are over
4,000 ships with a tonnage of over fi,000,000 in the
American merchant marine, which would suffer large
loss if ocean borne trade be not restored.
"The American standards of living will be affected
unfavorably if the existent barriers to trade between
nations be retained. A high standard of life depends
on the labor of a country being highly productive.
"A nationalist or closed economy will further
more bring in its wake, inevitably, an increasingly
rigorous control over the investment of capital,
whether at home or abroad, over agriculture and
its administration, and over industry for somewhat
similar reasons.
"Under an intelligently planned economy applied
both domestically and internationally," concludes Dr.
Boggs, "international trade would take (he place of a
sounder and less provocative basis than under tra
ditional capitalism,"
