"LA TOSCA (Puccini) —War Me- !
morial Opera House
Puccini had a knack that other
opera composers might have prac
ticed to advantage, theirs and their
audience's. He took care about the j
drama in his "music clramas." The 1
music is there as well as the drama,
but his integration of the two makes
opera that is emotionally moving, i
good theatre as wel las lyrical show- j
manship.
This benefits "Tosca" especially, l
even though its plot has been done j
in the movies 20 times. It moves
swiftly to dramatic climaxes. And
the production by the San Francisco
Opera Company last Friday did more
than adequate justice to Puccini. It
transcended him. Any company in ,
any season might shout about such a
performance. The three principals !
had integration in building the pas
sionate drama with conviction, ex- '
citement, and beauty.
It was really Lotte Lehmann's i
evening. Her debut in San Fran
cisco was a radiant Tosca, sincere, •
completely feminine. Her voice is a
delight with its color, its accuracy, 1
its absence of any harshness, its
strength; there is an elusive fresh
ness there, too, "personality" might j
be the word. But it is essentially
dramatic, so convincing that a de
spairing or vengeful parlando chilled |
the audience. Her "Vissi D'Arte" was
a cry of honest anguish, not the j
sensational wail Jeritza made it.
Dino Borgioli had a task keeping ;
up with Lehmann. But he sang well, j
when he found his voice more fully j
in the last act and rendered his aria !
with more crispness and kept rea- 1
sonable pace with Lehmann's rich
tone in their duet. Alfredo Gandolfi
was Scarpia, a good role for him,
since it is more dramatic than mu- |
sical, and Gandolfi is a capable
operatic actor. His villainy was sleek ,
and black, and his singing showed i
how much he enjoyed his part. |
The other roles were well done.
The staging of the opera was the
best I have ever seen in San Fran
cisco. The first act finale was im
pressive and the difficult second act
intelligently managed. The orchestra
was in fine fettle, but Merola in the,
conductor's box might have been
less deliberate about the score.
