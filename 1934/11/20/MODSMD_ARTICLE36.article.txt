# CAMPUS OPINION
## 
### 
The Editor Sir:
In a democratic institution such as
Stanford, we feel that the girls should
be entitled to the same privileges as
the men. In particular, the tradition
of riding to and from Paly should
not only be extended to men but
also to women. This conclusion is
based on the concensus of a group
of us who discussed the problem
pro and con.
The conveniences and advantages
of this courtesy are apparent and
there seems to be no reason why
the girls must wait for the buses
which seem always to be so slow in
coming. We are sending this short
note to you in the hope that it
will bring some expression of opin
ion from the campus on this matter.
We would like a lift:
8.L., L.W., S.H., P.W., K.C.

The Editor, Sir:
We are two freshmen, new to this
hallowed institution, and we have
enjoyed the brawls given during the
first few weeks of school under the
name of "Jolly-Ups."
We hope that such a noble insti
tution as "Jolly-Ups" will not be
corrupted by the usual graft and
that they will continue in the fu
ture.
