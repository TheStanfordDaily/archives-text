| "THE LAST GENTLEMAN"
Al the Stanford Theatre
Though not as powerful as 'The
i House of Rothchild," George Arliss' j
i last picture, this one is decidedly ;
worth seeing. Janet Beecher fur- i
nishes the only obvious flaw by do- j
ing the sweet and simple grand-!
daughter part almost too sweetly.
Arliss, as an eccentric but wealthy :
j old gentleman with a great deal of
! family pride, gathers together the |
! remnants of the Bar clan to attend j
j a memorial service. His grand
' daughter, whom he has refused to j
j see since her birth because she was !
not born a boy, arrives uninvited, j
Though at first seemingly indiffer
ent to the girl, he is very soon at
tracted to her.
The problem of who will inherit
old Mr. Bar's money gives Arliss ex
cellent chance for character por
trayal. First the weak and unlike-
I able son and then the granddaughter '
1 are to be the heirs. Then again the j
j son. The memorial service and un- 1
I usual reading of the will after Mr.
| Bar's death proves to be a most
(startling climax. —Magagna.
j The Piecards reached an altitude ;
| of 67,979 feet in their recent ascent, j

When Gertrude Stein came to this
country this fall to lecture she
brought with her Alice B. Toklas,
whom many who read Miss Stein's
autobiography thought a myth.

Warden Lewis E. Lawes of Sing
Sing picked "The Last Mile" as one
of his 10 favorite plays. That, you
recall, was the drama of a boy who
was electrocuted for murder.
