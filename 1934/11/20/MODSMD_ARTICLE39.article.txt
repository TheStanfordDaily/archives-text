"POOR CAL" BETTER
THAN "HATE STANFORD"
Tin 1 re are friendiy taunts such as
"Poor Cal."
There are also childish taunts such
as "Hale Stanford."
These words will be formulated
on many lip.'; from now until some
time after next Saturday's Big
Game between Stanford's Indians
and California's Golden Bears.
Stanford will get into the spirit
of the game before, during, and
perhaps after it is all over with
her favorite little slogan, "Poor
Cal."
And some of the older Golden
Bears will spend from now until
game time thinking, breathing, and
.•■peaking "Hate Stanford."
Il all started back in the spring of
1930 just after Stanford had recov
ered the Axe. From William "Fight
in' Bill" Hudson, editor of the Daily
California!!, came the editorial that
demanded undying hatred of the
horrible, uncivilized Indians. The
Stanford Daily reprinted the edi
torial, with comment, under a cap
lion that read "Poor Old Cal."
Last year, the Daily Californian
blasted "Hate Stanford" all over
its pages in the edition just pre
ceding the game, and William
"Fightin' [Jill" Ingram took up the
cry with his team.
This fall, Wall Christie, headman
of Ihe Daily's Berkeley colleague,
insists that he will do all in his
power to discourage the slogan,
which he himself brands as silly, and
the "wrong spirit."
AFTER ALL,
AREN'T WE PALS?
Taunts are good fun, and add spirit
to the game, but, after all, why
should California hate Stanford or
vice versa? Aren't both institutions
schools of higher education, rated
nationally in somewhat the same
class, and each drawing students
from the same portions of the coun
try? It all seems just a bit un
civilized and narrow-minded, if the
advocates of that philosophy are
really serious.
As a rule, both Indian and Bear
students root for the other to win
from U.S.C., for example, and
they are almost always solidly be
hind each other in intersectional
football games. There should be
nothing hut good sportsmanship
when they play each other. Cer
tainly, each should try to win;
that's the whole idea, but why
not keep it a game?
"Poor Cal" or "Poor Stanford" ex
press the desired spirit much bet
ter than "hate." They denote a cer
tain amount of disdain, pity, and
leave the person who utters the
taunt wide open if his team is beat
en. which makes the "friendly" ri
valry much more interesting and all
told less childish.
We hope you are successful, Mr.
Christie, in your plan to oust the
"Hate Stanford" philosophy from
your University of California cam
pus;
In the meantime, "Poor Cal."

"POOR CAL" BETTER
THAN "HATE STANFORD"
Tin 1 re are friendiy taunts such as
"Poor Cal."
There are also childish taunts such
as "Hale Stanford."
These words will be formulated
on many lip.'; from now until some
time after next Saturday's Big
Game between Stanford's Indians
and California's Golden Bears.
Stanford will get into the spirit
of the game before, during, and
perhaps after it is all over with
her favorite little slogan, "Poor
Cal."
And some of the older Golden
Bears will spend from now until
game time thinking, breathing, and
.•■peaking "Hate Stanford."
Il all started back in the spring of
1930 just after Stanford had recov
ered the Axe. From William "Fight
in' Bill" Hudson, editor of the Daily
California!!, came the editorial that
demanded undying hatred of the
horrible, uncivilized Indians. The
Stanford Daily reprinted the edi
torial, with comment, under a cap
lion that read "Poor Old Cal."
Last year, the Daily Californian
blasted "Hate Stanford" all over
its pages in the edition just pre
ceding the game, and William
"Fightin' [Jill" Ingram took up the
cry with his team.
This fall, Wall Christie, headman
of Ihe Daily's Berkeley colleague,
insists that he will do all in his
power to discourage the slogan,
which he himself brands as silly, and
the "wrong spirit."
AFTER ALL,
AREN'T WE PALS?
Taunts are good fun, and add spirit
to the game, but, after all, why
should California hate Stanford or
vice versa? Aren't both institutions
schools of higher education, rated
nationally in somewhat the same
class, and each drawing students
from the same portions of the coun
try? It all seems just a bit un
civilized and narrow-minded, if the
advocates of that philosophy are
really serious.
As a rule, both Indian and Bear
students root for the other to win
from U.S.C., for example, and
they are almost always solidly be
hind each other in intersectional
football games. There should be
nothing hut good sportsmanship
when they play each other. Cer
tainly, each should try to win;
that's the whole idea, but why
not keep it a game?
"Poor Cal" or "Poor Stanford" ex
press the desired spirit much bet
ter than "hate." They denote a cer
tain amount of disdain, pity, and
leave the person who utters the
taunt wide open if his team is beat
en. which makes the "friendly" ri
valry much more interesting and all
told less childish.
We hope you are successful, Mr.
Christie, in your plan to oust the
"Hate Stanford" philosophy from
your University of California cam
pus;
In the meantime, "Poor Cal."
—Browne.
