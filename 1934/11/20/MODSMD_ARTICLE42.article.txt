Today Coach Harry Maloney re
ceived permission from the graduate
managers of the two universities to
play the game, which was postponed
Saturday because of rain, in the
middle of the week. As yet definite
word from the Cal coach has not
arrived but it is expected that he
will agree to Maloney's proposal.
The Card field was put in bad
shape by the heavy rains of the
week-end so that if the game is
played Wednesday the scene of bat
tle will be moved to the l'rosh foot
ball field. Temporary goal posts with
a new set of nets will be set up
tomorrow.
