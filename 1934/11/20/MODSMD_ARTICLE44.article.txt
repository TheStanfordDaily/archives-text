# SQUAD WILL NOT HOLD SCRIMMAGE BEFORE BIG GAME
## Thornhill Steers Clear Of Injury Dangers In Light Workouts 
### 
"It's no different from any other
! game. It's just a ball game."
And with this admonishment,
Claude E. Thornhill began putting
his Stanford Indians through their
last week of practice for the 40th
annual Big Game with California in
Berkeley Saturday.
The Indians will not scrimmage
this week. Thornhill was very defi
! nite in this assertion. He claims
Stanford's condition is good enough,
and he will send them through lots
lof heavy running to be sure th >
Cards' wind holds out, but will no # .
risk injuries on heavy body-contact
i work.
Whole Team Ready
As it is, everyone will be ready
for full-time work against the Bears,
unless someone hits a door in the
dark or "gets run over by a car," as
Tiny expressed it.
1 During a long routine drill on a
I sloppy field last night, Bobby Gray
son, Bob Black, and Woody Adams,
the sick men of last week, were all
| on hand and going through regular
work. Both Black and Adams are
! nearly entirely recovered from
> sprained ankles, and Grayson's cold
i and abdominal injury apparently
have disappeared.
I Bones Hamilton and Johnny Reis
; ner, halfbacks, were both consigned
' to the hospital and did not work out
last night, but their minor bruises
j suffered in the Olympic Club game
last Saturday are expected to be well
! on Wednesday.
Name Captain Saturday
Thornhill will not appoint a cap
. tain until game time Saturday. The
California squad elected Arleigh
Williams to lead the Bears, follow
j ing their game with Idaho last
1 week-end. Tiny will announce his
! starting line-up following the final
i practice Thursday.
In past years, Stanford has gone
i into seclusion on Friday before the
! game, but this week the Cards will
not leave the campus until Saturday
| morning.
The Indians worked on several
: new plays yesterday, and the attack
will be "fancier" for the Bears than
j for any other game this year, but
Thornhill will continue with his
â€¢ policy of carrying only 20-odd plays
| for his field generals to choose from.
The Indians worked out on pass
-1 ing and slithered through a varied
I running attack on the soggy field
against dummy opposition yester
i day, and probably will continue with
] this routine type of practice for all
l of the remaining practices this week.
