# WATER POLO TEAM FACES CAL, O.C. IN CRUCIAL BATTLES
## 
### 
I
Still undefeated, but facing their i
highest hurdle of the season, Stan
ford's varsity water poloists are pre
paring for three hard games within j
the next week. If they can win from j
the Olympic Club tomorrow night,
and California Saturday and a week
from today, they will deserve recog
nition as the greatest of a long line
of successful Indian aquatic teams.
Nort Thornton's championship
outfit will play the Olympians in a
return game tomorrow night at the
Crystal Palace Baths in San Fran
cisco. Barely able to nose out the
clubmen in extra periods in their
home tank, the Cards are sure to
have their hands full under strange
conditions. The city pool is of the
maximum size, measuring 90 by GO
feet.
Even if they conquer the danger
ous Winged "O" aggregation, the In
dians will again endanger their lead
in the conference when they meet
California at Berkeley Saturday
morning at 11 o'clock in a toss-up
game. Another game with the Bears,
to be played Tuesday, November 27,
in Encina tank, will close the 1934
season for Stanford.
