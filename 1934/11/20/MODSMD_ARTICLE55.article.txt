### 

A non stop flight from Los Angeles to Tokio is being planned by Monty G. Mason, transport and speed
flier. Mason is shown beside the dual tail of the odd looking craft which has a tremendous load carrying
capacity. It has a wing span of 55 and a half feet and is 32 feet in length. Mason expects to takeoff about
Dec. 1 and cover the 6400 miles in 37 hours. (Associated Press Photo)
