## 
### JOHN McCLELLAND 
The most powerful newspaper
I man in the world- the man who
j literally has thousifnds of news
papers under his thumb — was a
Stanford guest Sunday.
Jaeob Doletsky, head of the pow
! erful Russian Ta.ss agency which
1 controls all news dispatches and
propaganda which enters or leaves
Russia, devoted a day of his tour of
the United States to the Farm —the
guest of Henry Lanz, associate pro
fessor of Slavic languages.
A short, squat man with closely
cropped hair, Doletsky appears a
I typical modefn Russian. At a tea
j given him by Professor Lanz, his
manner was one of extreme courtesy
which almost amounted to humble
i ness. He speaks English fairly well
! and readily told of his country and
commented on the things he ob-
I served in the United States.
Student Life
! After being shown the Stanford
campus, he spoke of Russian univer
sities, telling of their inferiority from
I the standpoint of equipment, their
I lack of interest in sports, their dor
mitories where men and women
often, live in the sume buildings.

J "Russian students study too hard,"
, trained lechnicians in my country
that all the students overwork
themselves in preparing for their
work."
In Russian universities, tuition,

! board, and room are free to every
he said. "There is such a need for
one, the Soviet executive revealed.
"The chief recreation of the Rus
sian people is in the arts —especially
in the theatre," Doletsky explained.
i "There are legitimate theatres in
almost every village, and the people
attend them regularly. Such popu-
I larity has put the drama far ahead
of that of the United States, but we
are still not very far advanced in
i motion pictures."
Like Music, Dancc
The people of the Soviet were also
| described as devotees of the dance,
I of music, and of literature.
"Before the war," the Russian
stated, "our country looked mainly
to Germany for technical achieve
ment. Now we look to the United
States with interest and admiration.
We study American methods."
Doletsky declared that Russian
j living conditions are improving and
J that the whole country is better off
' now than it has ever been in recent
years.
Monday the Russian official spent
in San Francisco. Yesterday hp was
the guest of William Randolph
I Ili'aisl at his home in San Simeon.
