# BAN PLACED ON NAVY SECRETS TO STOP LEAKS
## Foreign Power Declines Official Channels For Grapevine MANUFACTURERS HIT Munition Firms Close Shop To Espionage 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 20 (JP).—'The
United States, seeking a better bar
gaining position with foreign naval
powers, was disclosed today to have
clamped rigid secrecy restrictions on
information concerning new naval
developments.
The Navy Department's move was
prompted by word that "leaks" had
occurred. At least one world power
was known to have refused to co
operate in an exchange of naval data,
claiming that it could get all the
necessary information through so
called unofficial channels.
Swanson Orders
The new restrictions are contained
in a series of orders issued over the
signature of Secretary Swanson.
They apply not only to the navy, but
to government and private ship
yards where London treaty vessels
are being constructed.
Certain manufacturers of device#;
for warships and naval aircraft also
are placed under the restrictions.
Gunnery Secret
Particular secrecy has been
thrown around certain improve
ments in naval construction, radio
developments, gunnery, and addi
tional safety factors of ships against
torpedoes and aircraft.
The restrictions were authorita
tively said to be designed to prevent
so-called "unofficial espionage" and
thus give United States naval at
taches something to trade with in
obtaining information from foreign
powers.
The "unofficial espionage" chan
nels were described as through cer
tain congressional investigation com
mittees, and those which consider
war and navy annual supply bills,
as well as the Secretary's annual
report to Congress, and through
motion pictures on naval devices and
activities.
