### 
The announcement that two cam
pus orchestras will play at the Big
Game Dinner Dance Saturday night
at the Fairmont Hotel was made
yesterday as reservations reached a
number large enough to open a
second ballroom of the hotel for the
celebration.
A1 Eushton's Royal Cardinals will
play in the Venetian Room, Gordon
Heche's band will be in the Gold
Ballroom, and the entire Glee Club
will present several numbers in what
will be the largest concentration of
Stanford talent in San Francisco for
some time.
Around the tables and 011 the
dance floor a capacity crowd of
Stanford students and alumni is ex
pected. The Alumni Association,
sponsors of the affair, and the B.A.C.
have invited Ihe entire football squad
and coaches, and the biggest celebra
tion in years is being planned.
A new low price has resulted in a
large number of students making
reservations for the dance. The few
reservations left are available at the
Alumni oflice in the Administration
Building.
The highest spot regularly inhab
ited by humans is at Hanie, Tibet,
where Buddhist priests live at an
altitude of 16,000 feet.
