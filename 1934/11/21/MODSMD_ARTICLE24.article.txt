# We're Not Vandals, And This Is Big Game Week
## 
### 
While gridiron rustics on liolli sides ol' the
San Francisco Hay bide their time until Satur
day afternoon, eon Hiding reports from Ber
keley indicate the Big "<!" adorning Tightwad
tlill may or may not have been tinted a bril
liant red hue this week. The facts of the
case notwithstanding, a question of etiquette
arises.
The Indians and the Bears, rivals in every
known field of competition, mutually sit back
and bellow "Pooooor Cal" or "Pooooor Stan
lord" and enjoy themselves in the doing. Fur
ther than that, hotels are jammed after the
ijanie with joyous enthusiasts from both in
stitutions, rubbing elbows on the dance floor
in good fellowship. No Stanford man is going
to sock a son of the Blue and Gold in the
schnozz just because of a football game. No
(lalifornian will visit the Stanford .campus
with intent to bomb, burn, or otherwise elim
inate any of the buildings on the Farm.
A standing agreement between the two in
stitutions declares that, if any properly de
struction by registered students, arising out
of athletic Competition between the univer
sities, is discovered, the game iit question shall
be called oil' and the students in question sus
pended immediately.
That agreement has been kept, and although
I be fiction of the Bed may never become
a reality, it is a new idea to discard any sopho
moric aspirations to "raid" any place in order
to create a bit of excitement. Better it is to
bop on the boat into the full swing of a Big
(lame week that oilers all the opportunity in
the world for interesting diversions, and, when
Saturday comes, join the throngs with the
wail:
Poooooooor C.al!
