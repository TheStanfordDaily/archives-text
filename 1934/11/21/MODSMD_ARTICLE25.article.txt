(iuarantees of economic security, long and
vainly sought in the I nited States, are finally
beginning to loom on the horizon in the form
of the Administration's program of social leg
islation, to Ik- presented to the next Congress.
For many years America has valiantly re
sisted the philosophy of collective responsi
bility for the misfortunes of the individual,
even when those misfortunes have been no
fault <>l the person concerned, individualism
in the economic sense has long been non
existent for the average man despite what its
most ardent disciples may say to the contrary.
!i exists only for the favored few, whose
brains, training, opportunities, and frequent
ruthlcssness have made it a valid philosophy
for a small minority.
When the average man is out of a job, is
sick or grows old, he has nothing to which
he can turn. It is all very well to tell him to
save up for such an emergency. That sounds
fine, but how can a man who earns barely
enough to keep his family going put anything
by for a rainy day? The sad fact is that at
such a time his only resource is his rugged
individualism, and rugged individualism can
not be eaten.
That a changed economic system calls for
a changed social system is a fact that Frank
lin Moosevelt and his advisers appreciate. For
America the proposed legislation is progres
sive, forward-looking, and almost radical, but
in England they laugh at our slow and lum
bering attempts to provide social and eco
nomic security for the masses. For in Eng
land, even before the war, they resolutely
faced the task of providing for those who were
unable to take care of themselves under the
existing economic system. They say that we
are at least eleven years behind them.
And yet, in America, there are slill those
who, in the name of rugged individualism or
some such fetish, will resist 1o the last ditch
such humanitarian legislation as President
Moosevelt is Irving to enaft.
