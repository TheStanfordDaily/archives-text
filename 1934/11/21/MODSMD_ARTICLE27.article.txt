# "Big Business and Me"

### 
II is with a slight feeling of irritation that
[ One reads in the public* press that the "peace
truce" between business and government has
been endangered because President Roosevelt
intimated that the administration intended to
go ahead with its development of public own
ership of public utilities. If the truce is not
critically threatened, Ihc business men are
at least'"rullled."
The reaction of the majority resolves itself
into a feeling that if business is "rullled" it
is rather distressing, because business is likely
I to have to accept such public ownership in
the not too far distant future; and if business
1 cannot work out adjustment satisfactory to
itself, il may be placed in the position of being
I forced to take il and like it.
There is a growing wave of belief among
not only the masses, Inil in the great and neb
ulous middle class, that public utilities must
eventually revert to the governments that
originally created them,'and by whose good
graces they have been allowed to flourish and
; grow.
II seems to be the common opinion among
college students who are willing to talk about
the subject, that :iil business, where the public
interest is vitally concerned, must be brought
under Ihe fold of governmental control. It
is suggested that such designations of public
utilities should be extended to include all
| communication and transportation services;
all banking and financial facilities; all vital
foodstuffs, such as milk supply; and the pro
-1 vision of heat, power, fuel, water, and the
disposal of refuse.
These are extreme expectations, we grant,
but if they are common among the younger
citizens of the nation, business will do well to
cultivate the friendship of the men who some
day will be in the driver's seat. A co-operative
attitude today may purchase much valuable
good will on the morrow.
