which allows thousands of individuals to
waste time and money at the troughs of public

when their advisers are convinced that they
have no place in college? Hundreds of indi

life, are going to he graduated, without honors,
within the next few years. Can such lowering
of standards be justified?â€” Daily l\ans<m
