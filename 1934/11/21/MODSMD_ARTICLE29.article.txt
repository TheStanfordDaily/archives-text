WITH EDWIN A. COTTRELL
Promotion of social and economic welfare of the
Tennessee Valley is the expressed purpose of Roose
velt's Tennessee Valley project, but Edwin A. Cottrell,
professor of political science, sees in it more than the
mere carrying out of another New Deal policy.
"The T.V.A. is carrying out what has been done
in a smaller way by certain localities and what
has been done by foreign countries for many
years," be said.
The plan is to use the Wilson Dam. an existing
structure, and construct around it other industries. In
this way an attempt is being made to produce an area
with facilities to take care of people who cannot find
subsistence elsewhere.
"It is the purpose of the government," he said, "to
set up in this selective area some government authority
which can put people on a higher scale of living at
minimum cost. The government will compare cost of
living in our general system with that in the created
community and set up what some consider will be the
ideal living condition."
"The plan is not strictly Federal," Cottrell
pointed out. "It is incorporated in the laws of
Delaware and Tennessee. If the plan is a success
Roosevelt will try to adapt it to other areas. It is
really only an experiment and no one knows what
the outcome will he."
"Tennessee Valley is a very favorable spot to test,
the experiment because of the huge primary invest
ment already thereâ€”the Wilson Dam. It acts as a florid
control measure and provides water for irrigation.
"The area is unusually wealthy in minerals and
resources and i.s the center of a large but backward
population."
In addition to the dam the government project
provides for homesteading and opportunity to partici
pate in small industries to add to the income. Through
manufacturing when not busy on their portion of land
the inhabitants of the valley receive agricultural re
turn.l! as well as a money salary.
"I believe the TVA is a very valuable experi
ment. Of course, its efficiency depend' on the
people who control it." the professor said.
Those adverse to the plan make accusations of
Communism creeping into the New Deal. Cottrell re
marked, "The only Communistic port of the plan is
thai the government owns the means of production.'
