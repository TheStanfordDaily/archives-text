# BULL SESSION
## TALKING TO YOURSELF 
### 
! Everyone has had the pleasant
! experience of laughing at the person
! who walks the Quad mumbling to
himself. The happening is such a
i common one that certain cliches

have developed to
describe such
mumblers. ''The
pour guy is bats,"
or "At last she's
found someone in
telligent to talk to,"
and a host of other
little criticisms in
variably invoke the
suppressed giggle
and roadv smirk.

But though they are comparatively
i few—who are bold enough or ab
| sent-minded enough—to walk the
| streets with lips a-wiggle, everyone
I at some time or other does indulge
| in the vice. Some do not shout at
' themselves. Many prefer to whisper
]to the hidden ego. Some there are
1 who engage in completely silen r
j confabs vvilh the inner s :lf. But
i from the cradle to the grave, every
! one holds communion with himself
| in more or less boisterous fashion.
It is a joy. When things go wrong,
| a little conferring with oneself makes
■ them all right again. Faults are
! talked away. Quiz hutches are for
j given. Social slips are rationalized
i into insignificance.
A conscience is sometimes troub
] lesome or meddlesome. Yet, with a
i little self-training in self-conferring,
i all evil can be effectively reduced to
! a warm and satisfying glow. You
S will say to yourself those things you
: like to hear. Though a nosy prof or
j grader may tell you you're all wet,
j you will convince yourself that you
| are astonishingly dry. You will not
i argue with yourself—at least not
' very violently. You will agree that
j you are right.
You may think that you would
| bore yourself with these self con
| ferences, constantly resaying and
! rehearing those things with which
you are in absolute accord. But that
is not the case. Though such repe
tition may at times be a trifle mo
notonous, the boredom is more than
offset by the pleasure of having
someone agree with you. There is
no -greater joy than "being right,"
j and talking to yourself will make
i you feel right.
If you have not had the over

liU■: ■ • ' I
whelming satisfaction of talking to 1
| yourself, do so. For then you will!
( understand:
1. How society ladies can put up f
with the ceaseless gossip over the
teacups, week after week.
2. How Rotarians can sit through
| those quaint luncheons.
3. How pepole can write campus
opinions, and sign them "Frosh
Gigolo," or "Three Gentlemen"; or i
simply write.
It is just like talking to yourself.
