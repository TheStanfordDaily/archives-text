If plays are not arriving in New
York by the score they are arriving
in sufficient numbers that I despair
now of keeping abreast with the new i
openings. But I have seen two of |
the more important shows recently
and can write of each with consid- j
erable pleasure.
Within the Gales, Sean O'Casey's I
latest contribution to the theatre art j
is curious and thrilling. A symbolic
drama portraying the contemporary !
struggles and vanities and aspirations
of mah, it is certainly not ot the or
dinary run of plays.
Rather, it may be called an eclec
tic drama, for it employs the arts of
music and dancing as well as those ;
usually expected of the play. And
thanks to the vital force of Lillian
GLsh and Bramwell Fletcher, the as
sistance of a fine company, and the j
sensitive direction of Melvyn Doug- 1
las, it emerges far above the initial
expectation of those who said, after
the inferior London production, that
it was essentially a play to be read.
It is not often that one encounters !
a play which is a truly thrilling ex
perience, and if not all of O'Casey's
implications were clear—at least to
me —his drama does not suffer from
a lack of intrinsic power that makes
it that unusual event —a truly thrill
ing evening in the theatre.
From his first established success,
The Shadow of a Gunman, to the
present play, O'Casey has been
straining farther and farther away
from the conventional forms and
bounds of the drama. His break with
the Abbey Theatre which fostered
his first successes (very much to
their mutual profit), was the result

of this very unconvenlionality in
The Silver Tassii.
And after some years of shudder
ing at symbolic dramas which strove
to support themselves upon shoddy
theatrics and claim a vhar« of fame
by the mere use of symbolism, it is

a pleasure to report that hero is a
drama surging with life, not heavy
with grease-paint, which employs
symbolism legitimately in a brave,
unflinching and dramatic criticism
ol modern life.

Rather, it may be called an eclec
tic drama, for it employs the arts of
music and dancing as well as those ;
usually expected of the play. And
thanks to the vital force of Lillian
GLsh and Bramwell Fletcher, the as
sistance of a fine company, and the j
sensitive direction of Melvyn Doug- 1
las, it emerges far above the initial
expectation of those who said, after
the inferior London production, that
it was essentially a play to be read.
It is not often that one encounters !
a play which is a truly thrilling ex
perience, and if not all of O'Casey's
implications were clear—at least to
me —his drama does not suffer from
a lack of intrinsic power that makes
it that unusual event —a truly thrill
ing evening in the theatre.
From his first established success,
The Shadow of a Gunman, to the
present play, O'Casey has been
straining farther and farther away
from the conventional forms and
bounds of the drama. His break with
the Abbey Theatre which fostered
his first successes (very much to
their mutual profit), was the result

of this very unconvenlionality in
The Silver Tassii.
And after some years of shudder
ing at symbolic dramas which strove
to support themselves upon shoddy
theatrics and claim a vhar« of fame
by the mere use of symbolism, it is

a pleasure to report that hero is a
drama surging with life, not heavy
with grease-paint, which employs
symbolism legitimately in a brave,
unflinching and dramatic criticism
ol modern life.

If plays are not arriving in New
York by the score they are arriving
in sufficient numbers that I despair
now of keeping abreast with the new i
openings. But I have seen two of |
the more important shows recently
and can write of each with consid- j
erable pleasure.
Within the Gales, Sean O'Casey's I
latest contribution to the theatre art j
is curious and thrilling. A symbolic
drama portraying the contemporary !
struggles and vanities and aspirations
of mah, it is certainly not ot the or
dinary run of plays.
