# CAMPUS OPINION
## A
						SUGGESTION 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Some l'ellows naturally have a
contagious, sparkling personality
which spontaneously gives vent to
clever and witty remarks. Others
are not so fortunate. Some people
can entertain an audience easily and
at will by skillful manipulation of
the ordinary sequence of events.
Some people can make their au
dience do anything they want it to
do. Other people merely antagonize
their audience into doing anything it
wants to dcr.
In the case of yell leaders, Triolo
may be of the former group; the as
sistant yell leaders are of the latter.
I appreciate that the assistants may
be personally charming and their
efforts sincere, but crude attempts at

wit and humor fall very flat indeed,
and produce an effect similar to in
digestible food. Isn't it far better
not to attempt the impossible, and
just to be natural, thus keeping in
tact the good feelings of the rooting
section? Who knows? Such behavior
might even win the election of head
yell leader for the ensuing year.
Too numerous patronizing smiles, a
set of even, glistening teeth contin
uously exhibited, and such boringly
trite remarks as "The Stanford
Rhythm Rascals will now offer . . ."
(referring, of course, to the Stanford
Band) never made a good yell leader
out of anybody.
Yours for less sham and more real
enthusiasm or, if you will, a yell
leader.
F. P. S.
