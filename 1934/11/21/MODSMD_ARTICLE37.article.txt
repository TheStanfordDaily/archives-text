# MORE BROADCASTING

The Editor, Sir:
I wish to raise some objections to
Mr. A1 Masters' opinion, published in
Thursday's Daily, that broadcasts of
football games should be discontin
ued because of hypothetical damage
to ticket sales.
Quite possibly, when any given
game is broadcast under the present
set-up, a number of people weigh
the dollar sixty-five and a hard
plank against an armchair at home
and pick the armchair. Also pos
sibly, if the games were taken off the
air there would be a temporary small
pick-up in attendance.
But to do ,so would be short
sighted. Mr. Masters forgets that the
broadcasting of each game is in
valuable publicity for the rest of the
season and for the next season.
Broadcasting is largely responsible

i for the present interest in the game
'in non-college circles. It also helps
| keep the alumni excited.
For a major team, competing with
other teams both sportingly and as a
; business, to throw away free adver
tising is hardly like the B.A.C. The
| question of whether to broadcast or
1 not to broadcast has been definitely
decided by the dance orchestras,
i which had to face exactly the same
| situation. At present, no good or
j chestra considers a long engage
| ment without a radio hook-up.
Finally, pity the alumni who live
too far off to come .to a game, pity
I the students unable to travel from
Palo Alto to Los Angeles or the re
! verse, and pity the poor rough with-
I out a dollar in his pocket.
Sincerely,
Frank Dorsey
