# REBUKE, MELLINKOFF

### 
The Editor, Sir:
It's about time the frosh women
stop getting panned and kidded
about their 2:30 late leaves. Did
anyone (and Dave Mellinkoff in par
ticular) ever stop to think that per
haps we might prefer the changes
which the conference has ordered?
It's a great deal fairer to those
girls who have no protecting homes
nearby not to be under the constant
impression Ihat San Francisco and
Paly girls are staying up all hours

lof the night and morning as they
, please, while we are restricted as to
i our late hours. For the "home girls"
iit makes it rather hard. But just
i because the frosh women fail to rise
| and shine in mob violence against
| regulations supposedly formed for
J our owrt good scarcely indicates that
our timorous souls prevent us from
; doing so. That we are "taking it"
should be a commendation to us
j rather than a subject for continuous
disparagement.
