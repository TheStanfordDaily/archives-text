# 110 Stanfordites Picked For Year's 'Who's Who'
## 
### CEDRIC LARSON 
Stanford University has 110 mem
bers of the 1935 "Who's Who fam
ily," a survey of the 2750-page edi
tion on the library shelf reveals.
Stanford thus out-tops the com
bined intelligensia of Sacramento,
Spokane and Tacoma which have but
92 names among them. Alaska, Porto
Rico and the Philippines can boast
but 109 names. Portland, Oregon,
with 300,000 people, has but 100
listings, and the Hawaiian Islands 76.
Geographical index of "Who's
Who" lists 70 names under Stanford
Univei'sity, 47 for Palo Alto, of whom
24 are Stanfordites, and the rest of
the 110 live in San Francisco or else
where.
Emeritus professors possess one
third of the University's 110 names.
Thirty-three of the 52 emeritus
names of Stanford are listed in
"Who's Who."
Total listings by school faculties,
including both emeritus and active

members, are as follows: School of
Biological Sciences, 14 distinguished
names; Graduate School of Business,
3; School of Education. 4; School of
Engineering, 7; Food Research In
stitute, 2; School of Physical Edu
cation, 2; School of Law, 6; School
of Medicine, 11; School of Letters, 13;
School of Physical Sciences, 16;
School of Social Sciences, 39; Li
brary, 2; Miscellaneous, 11.
Consoling to the college student of
today is the reflection that of the
31,081 outstanding men and women
listed in 1935 "Who's Who," 22,966
are collegians. Of this number
19,874 hold degrees, and 3,902 failed
to graduate. Of the graduates, 4,693
have a master of arts degree, and
6,865 hold a Doctor's degree.
Taken as a whole, about one per
son in 4,000 in America makes the
"Who's Who" honor roll. The ratio
of Stanford University-Palo Alto vi
cinity is 30 times as great.
