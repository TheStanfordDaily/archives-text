# Funnymen Flaunt Supreme Chappie Issue Tomorrow
## 
### 
The world isn't coming to an end,
Santy Claus still lives at the North
Pole, the snail's on the thorn, and
Chaparral, as it has for years and
years, is still coming out on Thurs
day morning.
Because a Daily reporter yesterday
had become involved in the Einstein
theory and thought time was also
relative, he wrote that Chappie was
coming out this morning. "I thought
yesterday was the day after the day
before yesterday and today, and so
forth," he said.
The Ancient Dodderer Gordon
Steedman has prepared a stellar
issue for his Big Game Number.
Containing 44 pages of cartoons,
gages, poetry, and features, with an
additional four - page photolitho
graphic insert devoted exclusively to
pictures, the Big Game Chappie is
one of the biggest, gamiest, and
Chappiest Chappies of all times.
The last word in Ail-American
selections, Chaparral's Ail-American
team will appear in a two - page
drawing by Ollie Johnston that is
expected to settle the question of
which players are the All-Ameri
cans on the Stanford varsity. With
this weight off their minds, the
Stanford men can settle down to
winning the Big Game.
The old favorite, Anne Ritchie, has
whipped out a horrendous tale of
love and hate at Berkeley, and many
of the other all-star Chappie con
tributors have pounded out weird
witticisms to show the newcomers to
the Chappie what's what or which.
