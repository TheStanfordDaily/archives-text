# Norman Thomas Flays Present Fascist Trends
## 
### 
"Mother, may I go out to play?
Yes, my darling daughter;
Hang your clothes on the hickory
limb,
But don't go near the water."
In these words of the Mother Goose
rime did Norman Thomas, white
hope of American Socialism, char
acterize modern university educa
tion to yesterday's Stanford au
dience.
At the meeting sponsored by L.I.D.
and the Walrus Club, Thomas tore
into the present tendencies toward
Fascism in America and in American
colleges. With a gentle humor he
pointed to the recent "red scares" at
U.C.L.A. and U.C. as evidences of
the rising tide of Fascist suppression
of freedom of speech and associa
tion.
At times, deserting the role of the

mild Socialist pastor, the Reverend
Norman Thomas reddenefi as he de
clared that the labor movement must
either become revolutionary or per
ish into the arms of Fascism. He
made clear, however, that "revolu
tionary" referred to fundamental
changes in economic systems rather
than to the means of effecting those
changes.
For University students, he de
clared that the greatest crime was
"apathy," and infantile approach to
modern problems. He scorned the
detached attitude of the scholar who
knows all the answers, but doesn't
know what to do with them.
In a burst of closing oratory,
Thomas shouted that the old guard
had milked the economic cow dry.
that what was needed was not more
milk, but a new cow. The audience
agreed.
