# Committee Votes to Add Extra Dollar
## Money To Form Fund For New Theatre 
### 
Ex Committee members took one
further step toward the construc
tion of the new theatre last night
when they voted to add one dollar
for the Theatre Fund to tuition and
community fees beginning winter
quarter.
A.S.S.U". President Marvie Kahn
was empowered by the committee to
send a resolution to Dr. Wilbur,
president of the University, asking
"That the extra dollar voted last
spring be added to tuition, thereby
increasing tuition and community
fees to $115. This fee will be added
winter quarter, 1935. The money
shall go into the Theatre Fund and
will be removed from tuition unless
construction begins by June, 1935.
Pavilion Dollar Kept
The long-ntglected and much
used Pavilion dollar will remain for
uses of the student body if the pro
visions of another resolution go into
effect. It asks Dr. Wilbur lhat he
grant the A.S.S.U. the use of the
old Pavilion dollar for the regular
A.S.S.U. dues. Ever since the Pa
vilion has been paid for, the dollar
has been used by the student body,
but until this time it has not been
officially classified as a part of the
regular A.S.S.U. funds.
Purchase Piano
The purchase of $3,000 Baldwin
concert grand piano used by Walter
Gieseking in the Concert Series last
year was authorized by the Ex Com
mittee at less than one-third the
original price. In return for the ad
vertising given the piano company
by its use in the Concert Series, it is
willing to sell it to the A.S.S.U. at
this reduced price and give 5 years'
service on the instrument.
The Stanford delegation to the In
stitute of Pacific Belations was
granted $25 by the committee.
