## Society Will Have Active, Supporting Members 
### 
Declaring that "dictatorial groups"
were menacing the democracy at
the University of California, a chosen
group of students and faculty mem
bers met last week-end and organ
ized an Association for Intellectual
Liberty.
The new organization claims io
champion law and order, free speech,
and public assembly, and has
pledged its support to any effort
President Sproul may make "to
safeguard the intellectual integrity
of the University."
Membership, which may include
students, faculty, and alumni, is of
two kinds, active and supporting.
"Active" members must be chosen
by a central committee, while "sup
porting" membership is open to those
merely in sympathy with the group's
purpose.
It was stated that the organization
was formed in view of such in
stances as the recent egg-throwing
episode and the formation of "Amer
icanization" societies.
