# CARD, CAL SOCCER TEAMS TO CLASH HERE AFTER DELAY
## Game To Be Played Today After Rain Causes Postponement 
### 
Stanford plays California on the
soccer field this afternoon.
This time they play, rain or no
rain. The game was supposed to
be played last Saturday morning
but the torrential rains practically
washed the goal posts away. Today
soccer quarters will be temporarily
moved to Ihe frosh football field
where the turf is in good shape.
Game at 2:.'!()
The game is at 2:30 o'clock sharp.
The Cnl men and the Cardinals alike
are dropping all else for the after
noon to make up for what "unusual :
California weather" cheated them
out of last week.
Neither of the teams boast the
same strength they possessed last
year. Both are dependent to a great j
extent on sophomore players. How
ever, according to those who have
seen both teams play, the Indians
look the best.
Waddy White, captain and veteran :
halfback, will ho depended on this i
afternoon to fire things both on de
fense and offense. He will be at ,
center half with Ruddy Gonzalez on
his right and Bob Hall probably on
h|s left.
Delay Helps
The delay in playing the Bears
may prove to have been a good thing,
for it gave Maloney's men two more
much needed workouts. Except for
a few weaknesses due to injuries, the
whole team looks to be in the best I
shape of the year.
Steve Enke has come to fit in well
at left wing, AI Navarro is again !
showing his old form at center for
ward, and Herb Sawyer has showed
much improvement as outside right.
