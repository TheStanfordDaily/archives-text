Climaxed by their singing at the
Fairmont Saturday evening, the
Stanford Glee Club will take part in
three separate appearances this
week-end.
They will present eight old Stan
ford songs written by Stanford stu
dents between the years 1895 and
3905 at the Friday night Gaieties.
On Saturday they will sit in the
heart of the rooting section and, as
a group, help in the presentation of
the newly written Stanford song
which is being worked up by the
band.
Thirty-six of the club's members

conjunction with the celebration of
the Big Game at the Fairmont Hotel,
San Francisco.
