No Intramural Football Scheduled
Today
Yesterday's intramural activities
saw Sigma Chi's football aggrega
tion advance to mural finals at the
expense of a stubborn Phi Psi out
fit, while three golf teams entered
semi-final competition in that sport.
Manager Marvie Kahn also an
nounced that the fall mural track
and field meet originally slated for
this Thursday and Friday has been
postponed until next week because
of a conflicting date with the annual
California - Stanford cross - country
meet, which would prevent many of
the mural stars from performing.
No Gaines Today
No mural activities have been
scheduled for today because of work
on the Big Game bonfire and it is
probable that football will be sus
pended for the remainder of the
week due to Big Game activities,
Assistant Manager Giff Myers stated
yesterday.
The only football contest of the day
found a smooth running and potent
passing Sigma Chi bunch run wild
at the expense of a weaker but stub
born Phi Psi aggregation to win by a
score of 26 to 6. Sigma Chi's well
planned and well executed plays
proved the margin of victory in a
semi-final game in the rapidly clos
ing touch football season.
Brock Stars
The first Sigma Chi score came as
a result of a sustained drive featur
ing John Brock's speedy running
and several well-executed passes.
The touchdown resulted from a pass,
Brock to Willard Buscher. Conver
sion failed. The Sigma Chis came
right back to push over another six
points on a drive that started with

the interception of a Phi Psi pass.
Soon after the second half opened,
Sigma Chi again staged a long scor
ing drive. John Brock made con
sistent gains on beautiful, speedy
dashes through the line. After work
ing the ball down to the Phi Psi
five, a well-executed pass from
Brock to Wally Crowe in the end
zone put over the score. The score
was boosted to 19-0 as another pass,
Brock to Crowe added the conver
sion.
80-Yard Hun Scores
The Phi Psi's demonstrated that
they were still in the ball game
when, on the next kick-off, speedy
"Tony" Cockins, who played a stel
lar game for the losers, caught the
ball on his own 10-yard line and
raced down the sidelines, out
sprinting the entire Sigma Chi team
to take the ball over after an 80-
yard dash. Conversion failed.
The last score of the game came
as a result of a Sigma Chi drive
originating upon the interception of
a pass on the midfield stripe. A pass,
Brock to Crowe, caused the score,
and another heave added the extra
point to give Sigma Chi the game,
2G to G.
Golf Semi-Finals
From the golf play has emerged
three of the four semi-final links
teams. Zeta Psi, D.U., by virtue of
defeating the Dckes, Sigma Chi, at
the expense of Phi Kaps, are the
semi-final competitors.
Entry lists for the track meet will
remain open until Friday, it was
stated.
Lagging mural handball teams are
renfinded by Manager Kahn that, if
second and third round matches are
not played off by Friday, they will
be defaulted to the supper teams.

No Intramural Football Scheduled
Today
Yesterday's intramural activities
saw Sigma Chi's football aggrega
tion advance to mural finals at the
expense of a stubborn Phi Psi out
fit, while three golf teams entered
semi-final competition in that sport.
Manager Marvie Kahn also an
nounced that the fall mural track
and field meet originally slated for
this Thursday and Friday has been
postponed until next week because
of a conflicting date with the annual
California - Stanford cross - country
meet, which would prevent many of
the mural stars from performing.
No Gaines Today
No mural activities have been
scheduled for today because of work
on the Big Game bonfire and it is
probable that football will be sus
pended for the remainder of the
week due to Big Game activities,
Assistant Manager Giff Myers stated
yesterday.
The only football contest of the day
found a smooth running and potent
passing Sigma Chi bunch run wild
at the expense of a weaker but stub
born Phi Psi aggregation to win by a
score of 26 to 6. Sigma Chi's well
planned and well executed plays
proved the margin of victory in a
semi-final game in the rapidly clos
ing touch football season.
Brock Stars
The first Sigma Chi score came as
a result of a sustained drive featur
ing John Brock's speedy running
and several well-executed passes.
The touchdown resulted from a pass,
Brock to Willard Buscher. Conver
sion failed. The Sigma Chis came
right back to push over another six
points on a drive that started with

the interception of a Phi Psi pass.
Soon after the second half opened,
Sigma Chi again staged a long scor
ing drive. John Brock made con
sistent gains on beautiful, speedy
dashes through the line. After work
ing the ball down to the Phi Psi
five, a well-executed pass from
Brock to Wally Crowe in the end
zone put over the score. The score
was boosted to 19-0 as another pass,
Brock to Crowe added the conver
sion.
80-Yard Hun Scores
The Phi Psi's demonstrated that
they were still in the ball game
when, on the next kick-off, speedy
"Tony" Cockins, who played a stel
lar game for the losers, caught the
ball on his own 10-yard line and
raced down the sidelines, out
sprinting the entire Sigma Chi team
to take the ball over after an 80-
yard dash. Conversion failed.
The last score of the game came
as a result of a Sigma Chi drive
originating upon the interception of
a pass on the midfield stripe. A pass,
Brock to Crowe, caused the score,
and another heave added the extra
point to give Sigma Chi the game,
2G to G.
