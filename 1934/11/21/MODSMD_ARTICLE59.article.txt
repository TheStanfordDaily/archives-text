# Former Star Hoopsters To Oppose First String
## 
### 
With a strong quintet of former
Stanford stars to furnish opposition,
Coach John Bunn's varsity basket
ball team will play a practice game
in the Pavilion at 4 o'clock this
afternoon.
Led by Hal Edelen, all conference
captain and center of last year, the
alumni live should give the Indian
first stringers a good afternoon's
workout. Harlow Rothert, '30, John
Hancock, '33, Phil Moffit, '32, Charles
Glasgow, '33, and Bud Shreve, '34,
will probably be the other alumni
to see action.
The Stanford starting varsity will
be composed of Rod Bost and Howell
Turner, forwards; Kenneth Nobs,
center; and Robin Lindsey and
"Dinty" Moore, guards.
Coach Bunn announced yesterday
that negotiations are being made
with Utah State College for a game
to fill out the one bye in the Cardi
nal hoopmen's barnstorming trip
schedule next month.
