"In the present stage of the Bay
Bridge controversy," says Dr. Bailey
Willis, "the Board of Directors has
not yet faced the facts of the situa
tion; it is to be hoped they will do
so in considering the Building Com
mittee's report which is now in
preparation by the chairman and
his two colleagues. Their difficulty
in reaching a decision is grave, since
they are not themselves experts in
engineering or geology."
The Stanford emei itus professor of
geology hinted that the Board of
Directors is in a quandary, on the
one hand being bound by contract
to continue work, and on the other
hand realizing the risk to their en
terprise and their individual reputa
tions if they stubbornly persist with
their present plans.
Meanwhile the bedrock of serpen
tine is being covered with a thick
slab of concrete. It will, however, be
accessible since manholes are being
left like shafts. Through them the
foundation may be inspected at any
time and can be mined out if it
should be found necessary to re
place it with concretc down to the
level of the bottom of the channel.
