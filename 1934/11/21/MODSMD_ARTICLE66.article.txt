# Thomas Remembered In Cord Golf History
## 
### ROBERT EISENBACH 
The name of George C. Thomas
seldom is spoken when the smack of
driving irons sends little white pel
lets soaring over the green of Stan
ford's golf course and the eyes of
visiting pros light up as they survey
its long, sloping fairways, and its
ingeniously placed sand-traps.
Less seldom does anyone realize
that every inch of immaculate lawn,
every grade to every green, didn't
just happen — they were planned.
Ball speeds, iron lofts, drainage con
ditions, and the unpredictable hu
man factor, all entered into .subtle
conjunction.
Guided Plans
Back of this delicate balance of
facts was the guiding mind and
hand of one man.
His name, George C. Thomas.
His story, as told by Comptroller
Almon E. Roth, would intrigue
many a hard-boiled fictioneer, were
its superficial aspects altered to fit
the exigencies of commercial story
telling.
It has one factor that is univer
sally recognized as a component
of drama—death. It has more. It has
irony and frustration, for though Mr.
Thomas believed the Stanford course
would be the culmination of his long
and distinguished career as a golf
course designer, he never lived to
see his finished masterwork.
Though he knew every slope,
every sand-trap, every bunker that
irks and pleases the modern golf
dresser, he drew plans and directed

! operations while on his death bed
i in his Los Angeles home.
Directs Construction
"A man named Billy Bell was his
go - between," Dr. Roth recalled.
"Mr. Thomas would tell Bill what
to do, and Bill would shuttle back
and forth between the farm and
Beverly Hills bringing problems and
taking home solutions. As he lay
dying within the four walls of his
room, George Thomas shoveled the
dirt and ran the machinery as if he
were "on the job" himself. Late in
1929, just before the course was dedi
cated, he died, his job completed."
The designer of some of America's
finest courses, notably those of Lake
Arrowhead, Lake Oswego, and the
Los Angeles Country Club, he was
considered a scientist in his line.
His lifetime of experience in the
I business of golf engineering has
[ been put into a book, "Coll Course
| Architecture in America," recog
-1 rized as a fundamental work on
the subject.
