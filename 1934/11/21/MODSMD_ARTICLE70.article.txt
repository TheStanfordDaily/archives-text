# MANY BIG ELEVENS SET FOR TOUGHEST BATTLES SATURDAY
## Cards, Washington Huskies Favored To Win Tilts On Pacific Coast 
### 
Several big games will be played
this Saturday but none of them can
come close to the glamour that sur
rounds "The Big Game" between
Stanford and California, the greatest
football rivals on the Pacific slope.
Stanford has held the upper hand
in this game for the last few years
and will be favored to win again
this year, but that will not in any
way detract from interest, for last
year (he Cards were favored and
managed to eke out a 7-3 win over
the fighting Golden Bear.
Huskies, Cougars Meet
The Pacific Northwest holds its
annual big game this Saturday also
when the Washington Huskies and
the Washington State Cougars tangle
at Seattle. Washington State has
tied for conference leadership with
Stanford although they have been
twice defeated by non-conference
teams. The Stanford setback has
been the only one received by the
Huskies this season and they will
be favored to win over the team from
Pullman.
In the Middle West, Wisconsin
faces its supreme test this Saturday
when it will meet the mighty ava
lanche that is Minnesota. The Go
phers lead the Big Ten conference
and their rugged power should wear
down the dogged resistance of the
Wisconsin team.
Harvard Invades Yale
The ghost of old Eli will again
float over the Yale Bowl when Har
vard invades his territory this week
end determined to put to rout Yale's
best chance for a Big Three title in

feated the mighty Princeton team
7-0 and look to a win over Harvard.
Notre Dame, the up and down
team, faces the cadets from the
United States Military Academy.
Princeton and Dartmouth will re
sume their feud, and Temple will
endeavor to defend her undefeated
record against the invasion of Villa
nova.
