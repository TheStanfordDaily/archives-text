### 
Robert "Bones'* Hamilton will
Captain the Stanford Indian gridmen
Saturday in th.'ir 40th annual Big
Game with California.
This distinction was conferred just
before practice yesterday by Coach
"Tiny" Tnornhill, following his an
nouncement that no captain would
be named until game time.
Hamilton will start in his old right
half) jack position.
The team worked out in a tiring
two-hour running drill yesterday,
prepared to taper off today and to
morrow in final practices for Satur
day's season ciirnax.
Passing and other "frills'' featured
practice again last night, but it was
believed the trickery will not be
â– mployed if the Stanford running at
tack functions as it has in other
'limes this year.
Ballot Saturday
An announcement came from
Southern California that conference
nerubers would ballot by wh'e Sat
jrday night concerning the western
representative to the Rose Bowl
in Pasadena New Year's Day.
It is understood Stanford is a vir
ual cinch for-the bid if the Indians
/in from California, and that Stan
ord is in the running with the win
ier of the Washington-Washington
state clash in case the Bears should
>vin Saturday. The final decisions
â€¢vill be made public Sunday.
T!ie entire Stanford team reported
or practice yesterday, with the ex
option of Johnny Reisner, still in
he hospital with minor bruises.
Reisner will be released and go back
o practice today.
Line-Up Not Sure
"Tiny" will announce the Stan
ord starting line-up following prae
ice tomorrow, but an indication of
he team was given yesterday as the
irst string lined up for signal prac- .
ice in the following manner:
Bobby Grayson, fullback; Buck
Van Dellen and Hamilton, half
lacks; Frank Alustiza, quarterback;
vVes Muller, center; Woody Adams
ind Larry Rouble, guards; Claude
Callaway and Bob Reynolds., guards;
;nd Monk Moscrip and Keith Top
ping, ends.
Ivlac ntz was still considered a toss
ip choice at left half, and Muller's
center berth is insecure with All'
3randin and Nils Larsen both fight
ng for recognition, while Bob Black
nay get the left guard call from
\dams. Both Black's and Adams'
>nce-sprained ankles are back in
ihapo and neither will be handi
:apped Saturday.
