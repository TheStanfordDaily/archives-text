## 
### 
Minor sport interest swerves to
cross country tomorrow, when the
Bear Harriers from Berkeley inset
the Stanford runners on the local
golf course.
Leading Card hopes are Dave Dev
lin, Chuck Nimrno, and Bob Alex
ander. Leading Bear hopes art- Bob
Fowler, Torrey Lyons, and Andy
Wallstrum.
Fowler Known
Fowler has divers achievements
and records in his scrap-book to
talk for him. including a fifth place
in the I.C. 4-A., the Washington-Cal
two-mile record at 9.39, and general
Coast acclaim.
Nimmo was clocked in under 4.20
in the N.C.A.A. mile last summer,
and has shown proficiency in the
longer races. Devlin has been han
dicapped through injury the greater
part of his college term, but is in
good .shape, having won the recent
San Mateo J. C. race.
The modest Fowler claims to be
in poor condition, but still ranks
among the favorites.
Alexander Improves
Bob Alexander, soph SbO man, ran
nicely against San Mateo, placing
fifth; his team-mate, Rusty Harch,
is also one of the better entries. Two
other Card likslies are Ed Waseru
and Bill Leslie.
Brutus Hamilton, Cal coach, likes
the work of Torrey Lyons, who re
cently won the traditional Dipsea
race in Mill Valley. Andy Wallstrum,
renovated boxer, and Henry Ander
son are other Bear entries.
