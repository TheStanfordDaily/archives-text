Alli DISPLAY WOULD
SETTLE DOUBTS
Stanford has been playing foot
ball for more than two months this
fall, and so far the Indians have not
shown a passing attack.
We would like to see if Stanford
i actually can pass in competition,
j There io no particular reason for the
j Indians to give this demonstration,
i since so far they have not needed
' passes in order to win a game.
But the story is getting about that
Stanford has an exceptionally fine
football team. Even the conserva
tive and "we're - from - Missouri"
East has heard about the Big Red
Machine.
When a person hears about a
i hamwonship football team, a few
questions come to mind. Have
they p. smooth running attack?
Have they a good defense? How is
the mental attitude? What is their
passing attack and defense like?
The Stanford fan can proudly
crack back with a lot of figures and
enthusiasm concerning the efficiency

| of the Cardinal ground work. He t
â€¢ can point to steady drives down field ,
! during nearly every game this year,
j He can also point to the eight teams
j who have tried in vain to score on
[ Stanford as proof positive of the
impenetrable Cardinal defense. A
| look at charts of every game this
i year furnishes more confirmation of
I this.
! INDIANS ARE
I MENTALLY O.K.
j The crashing victories over lesser |
, teams that were figured as potential j
upsetters serve as an example of the
entirely sane mental attitude that is,
helping to make a championship
squad. i
The outcome of the Washington
game would convince the most
skeptical as to Stanford's much-1
disputed passing defense. Jimmy
Phelan, for one, is now a decided
advocate of the Redmen's powers of
passing defense.
But who is there to say Stan
ford has a passing attack? The
Indians did have one in and '

tl was a pass that won the Big
Game and set Stanford up for a
score in the U.S.C.* contest, but
since last year. Tiny Thornhill's
men have barely attempted an
aerial offense. A few tosses were
successful against the Olympic
Club last Saturday, but the un
conditioned Clubmen were so tired
that they did not justly test Stan
ford's power.
The Cards do not need a passing
attack to win games this year, that is
granted. But they have no basis for
a comeback when anyone states the
fact that they have not done any
passing as a proof that they are not
really as versatile as they think.
