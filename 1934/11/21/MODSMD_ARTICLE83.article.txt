# CARD WATER POLO TEAM WILL MEET WINGED '0' OUTFIT
## Indians Are Hampered By Increase In Size Of Playing Course 
### 
Stanford's varsity water polo team i
will play the first of its three re
; maining games when the Cards meel, i
! the strong Olymnic Club outfit in a i
return clash in San Francisco's |
Crystal Palace Baths tonight at 9:15. J
The clubmen will be even harder tu
beat than they were in Encina pool
j Saturday, and Nort Thornton's pad- I
: dlers will have to play at, top speed
; to take their measure again.
The huge Crystal Palace course is
! of the regulation maximum size, of
90 by GO feet, compared to Encina
! pool's 75 by 40 feet. This will be the
1 first game played by the Indians in 1
' a tank of this size, and the Olym
pians will have the marked advan
i (age of greater familiarity with con
! ditions.
As a result of Stanford's 8 to G
victory in two extra periods in the ,
Cards' home tank Saturday, tonight's
game is a toss-up. Starting line-ups
will probably be the same as in the
first game, when they were as fol
lows:
Stanford: Captain Leo Cook. Bob
Foster, and Vlad Taranik (sprint)
at forwards; Wally Wiget, Bob Suth
erland, and Bill Woodard at backs; j
Bob Haslacher at goalie.
I Olympic Club: Ted Wiget (sprint),
Whitney Burns, and Ginger Austin,
forwards; George Mitchell, Gordy i
Graves, and Marshall Dunn, guards;
. Elmer Collette, goalie.
