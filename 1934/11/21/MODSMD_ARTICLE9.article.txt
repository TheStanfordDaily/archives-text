President Ray Lyman Wilbur in a
previous statement made plain the

existing agreement between the two
universities in regard to invasion of
one campus by a rival group. He
went on to say that, "If it comes to
a case of members of each univer
sity invading the rival campus to
deface the church and other build
ings exposed to their violence it will
mean no more football."
Kahn in further statements said
that in the event vandalism takes
place on either of the two campuses,
ihe Big Game will be called off.
"This is no idle threat," said Kahn.
"and I hope our students realize
how foolish and juvenile it is to de
stroy and deface the valuable prop
erty of either Stanford or Califor
nia.
Kahn Speaks
"We have the Honor System which
implies actions worthy of the name
Stanford gentlemen. Therefore there
are many reasons why we should
respect the dual agreement."
The A.S.S.U. head said that Stan
ford students violating this pact
would be subject to trial before
either the Men's or Women's Coun
cil. In concluding Kahn said, "I
know that California will be a gra
cious host and the University hopes
that her students will be well man
nered, respectful, and grateful visi
tors."
