### 
SHANGHAI, Nov. 21 (/P).—Japan's

macy'."
A statement issued by the Japa
nese military attache' after the
Japanese military officers stationed

in the Tangku armistice agreement.

in North China which in the course
of two years of intermittent warfare
cost China more than 50,000 men and
the Japanese 10,000.)

months of comparative calm in Sino-
Japane.se relations, was in sharp

gradually bearing fruit in the North,"
he said.

the Chinese government) and en
forced by the Nanking government
led to the Manchurian and Shanghai
incidents."
