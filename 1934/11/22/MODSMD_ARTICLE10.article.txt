of the conference was Soquel, near
Santa Cruz, but this year's gather
ing will meet in the mountains of
Napa County again.
No lectures, no professors, and no
formality are the rules of the insti
tute, and all proceedings and ar

Round table discussions are the basis
for student opinions, and this phase
of the conference takes up the
greater part of the program. A lib
eral time is given for social and
recreational purposes.
Eight dollars plus transportation
covers the expenses of the confer
ence. Jane Sommcrich at the Union
and George Lee at the Chinese Club
