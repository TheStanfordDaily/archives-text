# Ballad Opera Sung Tonight
## 
### 
'"The Farmer," an old English bal
lad opera, will be presented this
evening at the Palo Alto Civic The
atre by the English Opera Players,
under the direction of G. Marston
Haddock. The company comes di
rectly from a successful run in San
Francisco.
Although written more than 150
years ago by William Shield, the
piece still remains as hilariously
and rollickingly entertaining to
modern-day audiences as it did
when first presented at Covent Gar
den, London. There is a naivete in
the construction that delights â– so
phisticated theatre-goers of today,
and they love the lilt and vigor of
Shield's songs, music which made
love famous in his day.
The performance is being spon
sored under the auspices of the Sun
day Afternoon Concert Committee,
for the benefit of the Piano Fund.
They plan to purchase the piano of
Louis Eaton, who was university or
ganist before Warren D. Allen.
Admission will be 50 and 75 cents,
all seats reserved. The tickets are
available at the Community House,
phone P.A. 21711.
