# SUBSIDY PLANS DISCLOSED FOR U.S. SHIPPING
## Government Officials May Submit to President's Marine Policy 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 21 (/P). —A
flat .subsidy, called by that name, was
disclosed today to be what Govern
ment officials now contemplate for
submission to President Roosevelt
for the future of the American Mer
chant Marine.
At the same time there is a strong
desire among them for retention of
the present plan of aiding aviation
through air mail contracts.
A departmental committee is
working on recommendations as to
the policy that should be adopted
for the merchant marine. Another
presidential commission is studying
air transportation. The two have
made a wide and deep study of
their projects. Their recommenda
tions will go to the White House for
a final review by the President be
fore some phases are embodied in
legislation.
Gifts of Money
Out of the ocean mail study is
evolving a plan, which President
Roosevelt favors, for abandoning the
present indirect subsidy to the mer
chant marine through ocean mail
contracts.
In its place would be substituted
one which would make flat gifts of
government money for the main
tenance of an adequate merchant
marine. These gifts would be based
on assurance that the companies re
receiving them would supply good
service and would keep their lines
and their ships abreast of the equip
ment of any foreign lines.
Decline To Discuss
The members of the two commit
tees declined to discuss in any way
the form their recommendations
will take, but authoritative persons
familiar with the course of the mer
chant marine study disclosed that
this was the plan in mind.
The presidential Aviation Commit
tee still is immex-sed in its study. Its
report is not due at the White House
until February. That of the Mer
chant Marine Committee is due
much earlier.
