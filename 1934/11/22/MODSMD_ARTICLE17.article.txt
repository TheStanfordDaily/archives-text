"Salesgirls, salesgirls everywhere
and not a drop within a mile and a
half measured in a straight line from
the edge of the campus," says Gor
don Steedman, Venerable Cuckoo,
very much elated with the Eig Game
of Chappie which comes out
this morning.
"It's a case of Chaparral is just
around the corner today. We have
the campus blanketed with Chap
pies."
Over in a quiet corner underneath
a pile of wit and humor Everett
Claiborne, business manager, re
peats the burden of the song:
"blanketedy blanketedy, blank."
Read All, Say Goons
"Read the funny jokes," says!
Steedman.
"Read the funny cartoons," says i
Gilman Gist, art editor.
"Read the ads," climaxes Clai- '
borne. "You won't die laughing:
reading them."'
Forty-four pages of the funniest 1
gags, cartoons, and comedy thai j
have appeared on the campus since |
the last time are in today's Big |
Game Chappie. Besides the regular'
44 pages, the old art department has :
sneaked in a four-page photolitho- '
graphic insert devoted exclusively to
cartoons and pictures.
Genius Names Stars
In an unexcelled two-page layout
by Ollie Johnston appears Chapar
ral's selections for ail-Americans, j
After taking a nation-wide pole of !
outstanding stamp collectors, the j
greatest all-American football team \
ol all time has been chosen, and
Johnston has "done them in oils." ;
"This is positively the all- [
American team I have ever chosen," j

says Steedman, the successor to J
Walter Camphor.
Steedman has developed a new;
make-up for his Theatre and Fables [
of Ihc Farm. He also has a new col- i
umn, devoted to innuendoes, come- 1
backs, and fast ones that arc high 1
and wide, called "Sparks from the (
Silver Hammer."
But the thing that has Steedman I
j running for cover is the snappy art j
i work of one Gist. (One Gist is good
as another.) A particularly color
ful cover will gaze out at Stanford
students as the salesgirls circulate
their copies. Salesgirls are every
where, and it points a wonderful
1 moral. I
