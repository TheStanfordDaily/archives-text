# Liquor Sale Condemned By Cannon
## Bishop Says Eighteenth Amendment Success 
### 
Striking out at the legalized liquor
traffic in an address last night in a
Palo Alto church before a large au
dience, Bishop James Cannon, Jr.,
of the Methodist Episcopal Church, j
South, stated:
"Prohibition in the United States |
under the 18th amendment was not |
a failure." He scored the personal i
liberty argument advanced by for- j
mer New York Governor A1 Smith. ]
In an organized society, the bishop ,
said, general social good must be put |
before individual desires.
No Discouragement
"I thank God that every church j
body that has met since repeal has j
sounded out no note of discourage
ment or defeat," said Bishop Can
non, "but every one of them has
passed sweeping statements concern
ing the liquor traffic, and the duty
of the church in calling for its ex
termination."
The bishop pointed to the great
increase in crime, accidents, and
drunkenness, since repeal. He cited
figures which showed 300 and 400
per cent increases in traffic accidents
in large cities. He entered a plea for
a renewed fight against wet inter
ests.
Daily Interview
Interviewed for the Stanford
Daily, Bishop Cannon stated that he
was a native of Virginia, and had
come to California only a month
ago. He said Stanford was thought
of in his home state as one of the
leading universities of the West.
He made no comments on the re
cent gubernatorial contest in Cali
fornia. While coming West on the
train, the bishop said that he had
read former President Herbert Hoo
ver's recent articles in the Saturday
Evening Post.
