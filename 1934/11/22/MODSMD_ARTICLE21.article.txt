# Check Made of Frosh Study Habits as Aid to Scholarship
## 
### HENRY TANI 
Freshmen students have hacl their
| personal inventory of study habits
j returned to them by yesterday, it
1 was revealed through Dr. C. Gilbert
; Wrenn, under whose charge the
| student personnel office gave the
tests and scored them. e
This inventory consists of 30
questions divided into three groups;
note-taking and reading techniques;
habits of concentration and school
| interests; and general habits of work.
! To each question the student checks
] his own reaction in one of the three
columns: rarely or never; sometimes;
i and often or always.
The results are returned so that
the student can understand the re
-1 lationship of his respective work

habits to scholarship. A negative j
score means that students of low;
! scholarship have checked a certain J
item in the same way as the par- |
I ticular student did. Conversely, j
I positive scores indicate habits of
students of high scholarship.
It is the aim of this inventory
and the student personnel office to
help the student correct his study
habit faults and thus get more ef
fective study with its resulting bet
tcr scholarship.
For a further discussion and in- j
terpretation of this inventory, Dr. j
Wrenn will hold a meeting in room j
214 at 10 o'clock this morning, to j
which ill I freshmen students are in-I
j vited. I
