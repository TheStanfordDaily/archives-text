# Team Confident In Yesterday's Big Game Drill
## Men in Good Physical Shape for Final Work-Out Today; Probably Will Rely on Ground Attack And Use Aerial Work if Necessary 
### MILLARD BROWNE 
This Big Game is just played for (he game itself.
And. believe it or not, that is actually the attitude of the Stanford
varsity in practice this week and with hut two days left before the 10th
annual tangle with the Golden Bears of Berkeley in the California Me
morial Stadium Saturday afternoon.

it is a wholly unnatural attitude
arc assuming for Big Game time. Ii
attitude they carry with them when
the schedule.
A witness at yesterday's workou
Tiny Thornhill's men were preparin

that those darned confident Indians
t is unnatural in that it is the same
practicing for any other skirmish on

it, for example, would have thought;
lg for a good stifT scrimmage among
♦ themselves on Saturday. The Cards
! wrestled about in their customary
manner at the start of the practice,
1 then cheerfully posed for photogra
phers, and genially went to work
in an ordinary practice session.
And the Big Game only two days
away!
j It's unwholesome, that's what it
is—this calmness.
But Thornhill hastens to assure
us it is entirely wholesome and the
hest kind of an attitude. "Over
confident?" he asks, all surprised.
"Nah, we haven't an over-confident
ball player in the whole club."
Know Own Power
The Indians are just supremely
self-confident. They know just what
I they can do, and they're not worry
i ing too much about what California
! can do.
! They did worry about what the
: Bears could do in part of yesterday's
j workout, however. Much of the
| afternoon was spent in defending
I against Ingram plays. The first string
' took the defensive role, and the
' third team masqueraded as a Cali
fornia line-up.
Stanford's famed power attack and
impenetrable defense continued to
j keep the Indians in a 3 to 1 favored
spot, and although Tiny did not
j show any enthusiasm for the rating,
he did not waste time protesting.
' He is also self-confident, not over
j confident.
Reisner Well
The entire Cardinal squad re
j ported for practice, and the team
i will be intact physically when game
i time rolls around. Johnny Reisner,
] latest hospital victim, was released
and drilled with the squad yester
day.
Thornhill will officially announce
1 his starting line-up following prac
| tice tonight. In running plays today,
1 the Indians lined up in the following
| order:
j Ends—Keith Topping and Monk
l Moscrip.
Tackles—Bob Reynolds and Claude
| Callaway.
Guards—Larry Rouble and Woody
j Adams
Center—Wes Muller.
Quarterback —Frank Alustiza.
Halfbacks—Acting-captain Bonus
j Hamilton and Buck Van Dellen.
Fullback—Bobby Grayson.
Line-Up Indefinite
This team probably will be the
! one that opens against the Bears,
! except that Bob Macntz is still a
j toss-up for left half. There is a pos
, sibility that Nils Larsen or Alf Bran
-1 din will open at center instead of
! Muller, and that Bob Black may get
! the call over Adams at running
j guard. Both of these men are re
covering from sprained ankles, and
! the one most perfectly cured prob
[ ably will open.
j Although the team has been work
| ing on passing considerably all week,
; indications were that. Stanford would
j rely on her ground attack in the
early stages of the game and save
the aerial work until it is needed.
I Stanford will hold a final real
j workout tonight and taper oft with
i sweat-suit work tomorrow after
i noon. The Indians will not leave the
Farm until Saturday morning at
' 31:15 o'clock.
