predicted a tough fight Saturday and
praised his team for their good work
this season.
Receiving free cigarettes on the
way out of the Pavilion, rooters made
their way to the bonfire blazing in
the field across from the Men's Gym.
Crowds of people gathered in

songs, lead by Triolo and the band.
The Rooters warmed themselves by
the fire until long after the dying
strains of the hymn had faded away.
