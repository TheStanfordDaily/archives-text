# A 						Collegian Wrote To Mr. Hearst
## 
### 
Francis Smith, Editor of the Daily Prince
lonian, wrote to William Randolph Hearst on
behalf of the Association of College Editors,
asking America's "Number One Nationalist"
and foremost publisher to answer nine com
plicated questions regarding internationalism
and disarmament.
The questions were propounded with the
avowed intention of "crystalizing undergradu
ate opinion on a national basis and on a na
tional issue," with the declaration in a dupli
cate letter to college editors that the United
States is about to plunge into an armament
race with England and Japan. The purpose,
then, was to make "nationalism and William
Randolph Hearst an issue of vital interest" to
undergraduates throughout the country.
Officers in the A.C.E., believing that Ihev
had placed Hearst in a diflicult position, sat
back confidently awaiting a letter in reply.
Clever, dumb-like-a-fox Nationalist Number
One,* yesterday on the front page of all his
newspapers, answered Smith's queries, mak
ing the young student editor appear slightly
ridiculous for his efforts.
Simply stated, the noted journalist an
nounced his stand thus: "I personally believe
in nationalism <tnd internationalism, each in
its proper place. I believe in benefiting all the
people whenever and wherever we can do so,
without sacrificing the interests of our own
people. . . ."
At this point, space does not permit a com
plete discussion of the merits of questions and
answers, as presented by Smith and Hearst,
Inc. The former can feel very elated this
morning, a student editor, classified with the
outstanding figure in journalism of the pres
ent century. His questions, characterized as
an "immense catechism" by Lord Beaverbrook
(England), were answered for several millions
of readers. One other item is of greater import
now.
The Association of American College Edi
tors, that convened in September, included
several editors of small collegiate weekly
papers, and but half a dozen or so editors of
the major collet/idle dailies. Not one paper on
the Pacific Coast was represented. Material
sent out under that misnomer (A.E.C.) then
must necessarily represent the action of com
paratively few individuals.
Those editors who have formed this group
have the light idea. Collegiate journalism,
influencing over a quarter <>! a million read
ers through the daily papers alone, does play
an important role in American student life.
To date, it never has whipped itself into shape
as a powerful, separate entity of nearly the
influence exerted by student thought in Euro
pean institutions. The thing can and will be
done, no doubt. But it should be carried
through correctly.
A convention of editors of <ill the college
dailies should be held at some logical spot
next month, and all action that reflects back
upon these papers as a body in the future
should originate with that group. Only if this
is done can the college journalist look forward,
with pride, to the part he plays in serving his
readers.
Another "letter to Hearst," as of yesterday,
must be avoided.

done, no doubt. But it should be carried
through correctly.
A convention of editors of <ill the college
dailies should be held at some logical spot
next month, and all action that reflects back
upon these papers as a body in the future
should originate with that group. Only if this

Another "letter to Hearst," as of yesterday,
must be avoided.
Francis Smith, Editor of the Daily Prince
lonian, wrote to William Randolph Hearst on
behalf of the Association of College Editors,
asking America's "Number One Nationalist"
and foremost publisher to answer nine com
plicated questions regarding internationalism
and disarmament.
The questions were propounded with the
avowed intention of "crystalizing undergradu
ate opinion on a national basis and on a na
tional issue," with the declaration in a dupli
cate letter to college editors that the United
States is about to plunge into an armament
race with England and Japan. The purpose,
then, was to make "nationalism and William
Randolph Hearst an issue of vital interest" to
undergraduates throughout the country.
Officers in the A.C.E., believing that Ihev
had placed Hearst in a diflicult position, sat
back confidently awaiting a letter in reply.
Clever, dumb-like-a-fox Nationalist Number
One,* yesterday on the front page of all his
newspapers, answered Smith's queries, mak
ing the young student editor appear slightly
ridiculous for his efforts.
Simply stated, the noted journalist an
nounced his stand thus: "I personally believe
in nationalism <tnd internationalism, each in
its proper place. I believe in benefiting all the
people whenever and wherever we can do so,
without sacrificing the interests of our own
people. . . ."
At this point, space does not permit a com
plete discussion of the merits of questions and
answers, as presented by Smith and Hearst,
Inc. The former can feel very elated this
morning, a student editor, classified with the
outstanding figure in journalism of the pres
ent century. His questions, characterized as
an "immense catechism" by Lord Beaverbrook
(England), were answered for several millions
of readers. One other item is of greater import
now.
The Association of American College Edi
tors, that convened in September, included
several editors of small collegiate weekly
papers, and but half a dozen or so editors of
the major collet/idle dailies. Not one paper on
the Pacific Coast was represented. Material
sent out under that misnomer (A.E.C.) then
must necessarily represent the action of com
paratively few individuals.
Those editors who have formed this group
have the light idea. Collegiate journalism,
influencing over a quarter <>! a million read
ers through the daily papers alone, does play
an important role in American student life.
To date, it never has whipped itself into shape
as a powerful, separate entity of nearly the
influence exerted by student thought in Euro
pean institutions. The thing can and will be
done, no doubt. But it should be carried
through correctly.
