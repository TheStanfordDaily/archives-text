# So Now, We Think

### 
The depression and the startling economic
and governmental changes of the last few
years have not hcen without their blessings.
For one thing, individual America is thinking
more clearly than it was five years ago. The
cold, hard light of reason has been thrown
on economic and social problems and has
nourished a healthy quality the quality of
doubt.
Citizens no longer are ready to espouse
beliefs because of their immediate or emo
tional appeal; moreover, there is some hesi
tation to continue acceptance of those blind
requirements which once constituted the
American (-redo of 1929.
*A recent report by a committee of the Social
Science Research Council emphasizes this
trend. The committee, headed by Dr. Hutch
ins, president of the I niversilv of Chicago,
and of which Stanford's own Dr. Carl Alsbcrg
was a member, \v;is bold enough to assert that
the high protective tariff system was not so
hoi. With composure, the investigators com
mit led what once would have been sacrilege to

Americanism l»v suggesting that the tariff had
tailed miserahly.
Strangely enough, the turill" found its warm
est support among that class which h;is been
least distinguished by ils application the
farmers. The Southern col ton raiser and the
Western beet man wanted high protection,
while men from the industrial centers were
most disgruntled with the system.
On other disputed points, the commission
found that the gold dollar was favored over
money of "greenback" quality, and that can
cellation of the war debts was the practical
move.
Such findings are not oflicial; they mean
nothing as far as the Federal government is
concerned. They are merely the cold state
ments of an impartial board, but as an insight
on the status of the American mind they are
highly illuminating.
