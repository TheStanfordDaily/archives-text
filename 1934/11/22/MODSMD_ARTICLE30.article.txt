# Supreme Court and Mooney
## 
### 
That interesting contemporary, the Polo
Alio Xcins, supposedly an adult newspaper
from which we juveniles might conceivably
learn something about the rudiments of pro
fessional journalism, came forth in its hist
issue with an exceptionally puerile front page
editorial on the Mooney case.
The Xcins makes the startling assertion that
the United Stales Supreme Court has no juris
diction over the Mooney case and that it is,
in effect, sticking its beagle in where it has
no business lo do so. Curiously enough the
Xews gives as the reason for ils statement the
belief that such action by the Supreme Court
lends to undermine the respect due lo the
slate courts. It asserts thai I lie Supreme
Court's recent decision will furnish every felon
in every jail in the land with a loophole
through which to evade punishment.
Such reasoning overlooks Ihe obvious con
sideration that all jail inmates are not con
victed on circumstantial evidence with their
guilt still very much a matter of question.
Nor does it take into consideration the fact
that a President of Ihe United States, Wood
row Wilson, once intervened because of the
apparent injustice involved.
In ils provincial regard for Ihe sanctity of
state courts the Xcins does not realize the sig
nificance of its criticism of the United Stales
Supreme Court. Respect for that high tribunal
must be maintained at all costs. If justice is
denied in the lower brackets, there must al
ways be a court of lasl resort to which the
American people can appeal with complete
conlidtfhce in ils integrity and fairness.
Let the United Stales Supreme Court inter
pret the law while the small-town editors tend
to their business of gathering the news in
terspersed with sensible editorial comment.
