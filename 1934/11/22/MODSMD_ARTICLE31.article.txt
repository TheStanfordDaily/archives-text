## WITH HAROLD CURTIS HAND 
### CEDRIC LARSON 
The middle phase of the rigor mortis of dictatorship
now appears to be manifesting itself throughout the
globe.
Mussolini speaks of Italy as a "warlike nation," and
twelve days ago launched the new "corporative" .ship
of state. II Duce's youth's organization, Balilla, now
includes six and eight-year-olds. Even the Italian
royal baby is christened with water from the River
Paive, "the scene of the hardest lighting during the
war."
Mercurial situations exist throughout the world.
Europe has weathered two major political storms in
the past five months. Uneasiness seems to be con
tagious. Headlines in the metropolitan press have
recently called our attention to the charge al
leged to have been made by Major-Gcneral Smed
ley D. Butler that a certain powerful minority
group is or was planning to out-Mussolini Musso
lini with a march on Washington to set up a
Fascist dictatorship in America.
Although these charges have been variously ex
plained away, or labeled untrue, nevertheless, the
committee of Congress on un-American activities is
continuing its investigation of the former Marine
Corps chief's purported statements that he had been
approached by brokers of Wall Street to head an army
of 500,000 ex-soldiers and others to seize the reins of
government through a coup d'etat.
Chairman John W. McCormick of the House
committee states: "We are going to get at the
bottom of this matter and we are going to call
witnesses and records that will bring out the
truth—whatever that may be." Meanwhile, Ger
ald C. MacGuire, one of those implicated by Butler,
asserts innocence.
Dr. Harold Curtis Hand, professor of education,
analyzes this situation from an academic standpoint.
"General Butler's charge, made before the House
of Representatives Committee on un-American Activ
ities, as well as all of the other information which
this committee will discover as its hearings progress,
is of peculiar interest and significance to all public
school teachers and administrators.
"Such charges, if substantiated, suggest that
many if not most of the vwiu' o v aspirations pe
culiar to our American democracy are seriously in
jeopardy. If is becoming increasingly clear that
the teachers of the nation must be organized if
the American public school is to be of any real
value to American democracy in its present severe
crisis.
"The public school can be justified only if it sets
itself to the task of helping the American people achieve
the values which (hey as a people hold dear. One of
the basic elements in our American tradition is r desire
for progress—a steady upward movement to newer
and Yuicr fulfillments.
"Progress in American life must mean change—in
some, if not in many respects, types of change which
will disturb certain powerful minority groups which
today benefit from the old order.
"Consequently, it follows that if the types of
educational experiences which are necessary to a
realization of the great aspirations which consti
tute the American dream are to be provided, teach
ers in the public schools must be able successfully
to oppose any minority group whose narrow self
interest leads them to attempt to restrict the free
dom of the classroom.
"lhat teacher;, are today unable successfully to
oppns" pov. rial minority (.roups is clearly evident
from tb" '•e , aiel~<>f Professor Howard K. Doale."
Dr. Hand concludes: "The freedom of teaching
essential to the educational tasks which must lie per
formed if the values of our democracy are to be
realized can, in my opinion, be secured only through
organization."

Although these charges have been variously ex
plained away, or labeled untrue, nevertheless, the
committee of Congress on un-American activities is
continuing its investigation of the former Marine
Corps chief's purported statements that he had been
approached by brokers of Wall Street to head an army
of 500,000 ex-soldiers and others to seize the reins of
government through a coup d'etat.
Chairman John W. McCormick of the House
committee states: "We are going to get at the
bottom of this matter and we are going to call
witnesses and records that will bring out the
truth—whatever that may be." Meanwhile, Ger
ald C. MacGuire, one of those implicated by Butler,
asserts innocence.
Dr. Harold Curtis Hand, professor of education,
analyzes this situation from an academic standpoint.
"General Butler's charge, made before the House
of Representatives Committee on un-American Activ
ities, as well as all of the other information which
this committee will discover as its hearings progress,
is of peculiar interest and significance to all public
school teachers and administrators.
"Such charges, if substantiated, suggest that
many if not most of the vwiu' o v aspirations pe
culiar to our American democracy are seriously in
jeopardy. If is becoming increasingly clear that
the teachers of the nation must be organized if
the American public school is to be of any real
value to American democracy in its present severe
crisis.
"The public school can be justified only if it sets
itself to the task of helping the American people achieve
the values which (hey as a people hold dear. One of
the basic elements in our American tradition is r desire
for progress—a steady upward movement to newer
and Yuicr fulfillments.
"Progress in American life must mean change—in
some, if not in many respects, types of change which
will disturb certain powerful minority groups which
today benefit from the old order.
"Consequently, it follows that if the types of
educational experiences which are necessary to a
realization of the great aspirations which consti
tute the American dream are to be provided, teach
ers in the public schools must be able successfully
to oppose any minority group whose narrow self
interest leads them to attempt to restrict the free
dom of the classroom.
"lhat teacher;, are today unable successfully to
oppns" pov. rial minority (.roups is clearly evident
from tb" '•e , aiel~<>f Professor Howard K. Doale."
Dr. Hand concludes: "The freedom of teaching
essential to the educational tasks which must lie per
formed if the values of our democracy are to be
realized can, in my opinion, be secured only through
organization."
The middle phase of the rigor mortis of dictatorship
now appears to be manifesting itself throughout the
globe.
Mussolini speaks of Italy as a "warlike nation," and
twelve days ago launched the new "corporative" .ship
of state. II Duce's youth's organization, Balilla, now

royal baby is christened with water from the River
Paive, "the scene of the hardest lighting during the

Mercurial situations exist throughout the world.
Europe has weathered two major political storms in
the past five months. Uneasiness seems to be con
tagious. Headlines in the metropolitan press have
recently called our attention to the charge al

group is or was planning to out-Mussolini Musso
