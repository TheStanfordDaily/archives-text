(Continued from Yesterday)
Conversation Piece is the first of
three plays by Noel Coward sched- 1
uled for local production during the :
current season. This "play with
music" has been brought from Lon
don with company and settings in- j
tact.
A reading of the play led me to
believe that the last act was anti- j
climactic and overlong. In perform
ance it is not. The whole produc
tion is so well and deliciouslv con- j
cocted that if there are any great
flaws I, for one, didn't notice them, i
Up to their old tricks, the local j
critics commended the reully de
lightful settings and costumes by (
Gladys Calthorp and the perform- I
ances of Yvonne Printemps and j
Pierre Fresnay. Then they spent a
great deal of time deploring Mr. I
Coward's "fiuffiness." What they ;
seek from any play, it seems, is a \
Moral, and Coward doesn't give !
them any. His play ripples along !
to airy musical accompaniment and
never once comes down to stern
realties or a discussion of Nazi-ism. |
Personally, I am inclined to be
lieve that this is a virtue and went j
to see Conversation Piece to enjoy it j
and not to be lectured upon the |
sad state of the world. In the same
way I went to Within the Gates, nol
because it is a criticism of con- j
temporary life, but because it is, ,
above everything else, stirring drama, i
meaningful or no.
A word should be said here of the
exceeding facility of Coward's di
rection. There are three or four j
scenes in which he employs clever j
repetition and highly effective \
trickery to add to the charm of his
•
play. The scenes about the streets i
and parks of Regency Brighton are !
stylized and artificial much as an
old print is artificial—and not a jot
the less amusing because of that.
And in the scene which closes the
second act a reception is in progress
during which, to point the speeches ;
of various groups of people, Coward ;
has frozen the rest of them in a

1 tableau which breaks into musical
chatter as each bit of separate con
versation is finished. It is a very
neat and—here—very pleasant use
of the trick.
Rumor suggests that, having
bought The Distaff Side for film
production, M.G.M. will use Sybil
Thorndike in the leading role which
she played in the London produc
tion and plays currently at the
Booth Theatre, where the play, from
modest beginnings, has built itself
to hit proportions.
And Tallulah Bankhead, once of
the films, causes tremendous com
ment in a new play. Dark Victory,
which as yet I haven't been able to
! see. The incomparable Lunts are

! about to start rehearsal with Noel
Coward for his new play. Point
Valainc. Later Mr. Coward will em
[ ploy his energies on a play called
Ringmaster,' in which, however, he
will not appear as an actor, it being
i naturally supposed that he will have
i enough acting to do with the Lunts
I to fill as much of a season as that
! pleasant trio cares to fill.
