### 
An inspired Boar eleven yesterday
.' ftcinoon bl;i led :he first "Beat Cal"
ambition of the year.
Indian sorternicn lost a valiantly
fought gam.' to the Bruins, (i to
2. Now it is "on to Berkeley"
where the second of the Cal se
ries will he played Big Game
morning.
A disastrous third quarter, when
lour goals were tallied against the
Card squad, which at tins time was
.studded with substitutes, brought
defeat. At other times in the fray
Cal displayed a brilliant brand of
jocecr but their two points only
matched the two of the Cardinals.
Bears Reach Peak
"We played .over our heads today
-—the best game? of the season," the
Cal men admitted after the game.
But their, win was a deserving one;
their goals were not flukes.
In the first period the Indians
started off with a rush, but then
lagged. Bearman O'Donnel, inside
left, soon pounded in one score and
later added another, crashing a
bounding ; hot into the corner of the
net. Norton, Hibbard, and Corlen
accounted for the other scores.
Ron Row, in the third quarter, put
the first Stanford goal in with a long
fast shot. A1 Navarro, center for
ward, scored next in the last period
when he dribbled past the Cal de
fense and tapped the ball in.
Trio Leads Indians
All the Stanford men deserve
credit for a hard-fought game but
there were throe true valianls among
the Red ranks—three players who
inspired by their brialliant and often
spectacular play. These three were
Waddy White, Barney Vierling, and
Ruddy Gonzales. To them go the
lion's share of what glory there was.
