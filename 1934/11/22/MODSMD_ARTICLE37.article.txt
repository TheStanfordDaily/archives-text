### 
Frosh soccermen yesterday after
noon shared the fate of the varsity,
losing to California 4-1.
The lone Card score came early
in the first quarter as a result of a
melee in front of the goal mouth.
Then Stanford let down just a bit
in the second quarter before
they could get their bearings ine
Bears had driven in four goals.
In the second half the Indian babes
went to work immediately to get
back the goals but the Bears backed
up in front of their goal and re
pulsed every offensive attack.

liams. left back; Munroe, right half;

half; Everett, outside right; Sehaupp,
inside right; Boyd, center forward;
