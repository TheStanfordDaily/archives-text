## 
### ROGER KIMBALL 
In what should be the closest and
best Big Game of all time in the
aquatic sport, varsity water polo ]
teams of Stanford and California
will clash at the Bear tank in Ber
keley at 11 o'clock Saturday morn
ing. The Card frosh will meet the j
Bear Cubs at 10 o'clock in the pre
liminary game.
This will bo the first time in 22
years of competition that California
is conceded an even chance to de- j
feat Stanford in a water polo game. |
Individually, both teams are the
best which have ever represented
the two institutions.
Cards Past Victors
vVith the championships of both
the Pacific Coast Conference and the
Northern California Water Polo j
League at stake, this tussle will
make or break the season for either 1

I team.
In spite of a record of 29 straight
| victories and no setbacks in Card
' Bear aquatic history, Nort Thorn
ton's men will meet a Bear that has
finally learned to swim and to handle
the ball, under the expert coaching
1 of A1 Dowden.
Cal Team Strong
Great teamwork shown in games
all season has proved that this Cali
fornia team is much better lhan last
j year's, which lost to Stanford only
! by scores of 5 to 4 and 4 to 1, with
the latter contest an overtime affair.
Stanford's improved freshman
outfit is slightly'favored to conquer
i the California yearlings in the first
| game. Like the varsity, the Indian
first-year men have a record of no
defeats at the hands of the Cubs,
but will put that record in real dan
j ger Saturday morning.
