HERE'S THE FOURTH
BACKFIELD MAN

Some weeks ugo we were blowing about a Utopian Stanford backfield
for this year and next year that would make the Notre Dame Four Horse
men look like a high school team.
We claimed that we had three men already for this backfield—Bobby
Grayson at fullback, Bones Hamilton at right half, and Frankie Alustiza
at quarter—that would suffice in any quartet, and all we wanted was a
left half that could make it four triple-threat men instead of just three.
Some weeks have passed since then, hut finally the suggestion came
along. Why not Monk Moscrip?
Well, why not?
Monk can pass and kick. He is one of the best ball carriers on the ,
squad, as witness his showing in his tew attempts at an end-around and
on his few runs with completed passes. He is as fast as any man on the j
team, and can block with the best. What is lacking in all that which !
would make a good left halfback?
The answer is, "Nothing."
MOSCRIP IS TOO
VALUABLE AT END
The only drawback: Moscrip is altogether too valuable at end. His j
smearing interference, diagnosing of plays, going down on punts, and i
other little accomplishments have done much to make Stanford the un- j
defeated team it is with but one game left.
No, Moscrip probably will never be shifted to halfback; so we can
go on talking about the possibility without intention of disrupting
Tiny ThornhiH's plans for 1935.
With Moscrip at left half, each of the four backs would have excep- ]
tional blocking from all three of the remaining quartet, and each would j
be a threat on a buck, end run, or reverse. All are adept at open field |
running, and they would be sprung into the open considerably.
Then Monk could take over Grayson's defensive work and permit
the Boomer to work at safety as he did for the frosh in 1932. Grayson's
safety work would equal that of Cotton Warburton in his heydey.
Moscrip could kick field goals just as well from this position, and there j
would be the added threat of a run or pass from place-kick formation. |
Each of the four backs could, and for that matter, has passed, and they j
are all good punters.
It would be rather unusual if Moscrip were an ail-American end j
during his junior year and an all-American halfback as a senior.
Oh well, it's all a dream, so we might as well go back to our work of '
wondering who will win the Big Game. —Browne.

Each of the four backs could, and for that matter, has passed, and they j
are all good punters.
It would be rather unusual if Moscrip were an ail-American end j
during his junior year and an all-American halfback as a senior.
Oh well, it's all a dream, so we might as well go back to our work of '
wondering who will win the Big Game. —Browne.
HERE'S THE FOURTH
BACKFIELD MAN

Some weeks ugo we were blowing about a Utopian Stanford backfield
for this year and next year that would make the Notre Dame Four Horse
men look like a high school team.
We claimed that we had three men already for this backfield—Bobby
Grayson at fullback, Bones Hamilton at right half, and Frankie Alustiza
at quarter—that would suffice in any quartet, and all we wanted was a
left half that could make it four triple-threat men instead of just three.
Some weeks have passed since then, hut finally the suggestion came
along. Why not Monk Moscrip?
Well, why not?
Monk can pass and kick. He is one of the best ball carriers on the ,
squad, as witness his showing in his tew attempts at an end-around and
on his few runs with completed passes. He is as fast as any man on the j
team, and can block with the best. What is lacking in all that which !
would make a good left halfback?
The answer is, "Nothing."
MOSCRIP IS TOO
VALUABLE AT END
The only drawback: Moscrip is altogether too valuable at end. His j
smearing interference, diagnosing of plays, going down on punts, and i
other little accomplishments have done much to make Stanford the un- j
defeated team it is with but one game left.
No, Moscrip probably will never be shifted to halfback; so we can
go on talking about the possibility without intention of disrupting
Tiny ThornhiH's plans for 1935.
With Moscrip at left half, each of the four backs would have excep- ]
tional blocking from all three of the remaining quartet, and each would j
be a threat on a buck, end run, or reverse. All are adept at open field |
running, and they would be sprung into the open considerably.
Then Monk could take over Grayson's defensive work and permit
the Boomer to work at safety as he did for the frosh in 1932. Grayson's
safety work would equal that of Cotton Warburton in his heydey.
Moscrip could kick field goals just as well from this position, and there j
would be the added threat of a run or pass from place-kick formation. |
