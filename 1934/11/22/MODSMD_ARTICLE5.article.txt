## Dress Rehearsal Indicates Show To Be Colorful Extravaganza 
### Helen Warson 
They're almost gone! If you want
to see the Big Game Gaieties of
1934, to be presented in the Assembly
Hall at 8:30 o'clock tomorrow night,
you'd better buy your ticket today,
because, according to Dramatic Man
ager Dick Frank, they're going like
hot cakes. A sell-out seems inevi
table.
Gay costumes, colorful scenery,
effective in its simplicity, and good
music provide the impetus for the
Ram's Head Gaieties, which, if last
night's dress rehearsal is any indica
tion, should be a riotous show.
Sets Colorful
George Andreini, technical direc
tor, and his staff of assistants have
worked out colorful stage settings

which will be changed often and i
quickly. The staff promises that
there will be no waits between num- j
bers on this year's extravaganza
program.
For the first time, Andreini re- \
ports, a good broadcasting system .
has been installed. Doodles Weaver. I
Jimmie Copp, Ernie Heckscher, and j
Norman Sears are a few of the j
singers and instrumentalists whose j
offerings will be amplified by the
microphone.
Chorus Good
Directed by Hester Beaudojn, the :
dance chorus of 12 women is said by ;
observers to be the best trained
group which has appeared on a !
Stanford stage for several years. !
Costumes arrived yesterday and j
were donned for the first time last \
night. For a much-speculated-upon !
"fan" number which promises to !
be one of the hits of the evening, ,
white, ruffled dresses will be worn. ,
Silk toppers and brief black and
white suits will be used in a "strut"' j
number. In the opening scene the i
chorus will appear in red trunks -
and white turtle-neck sweaters.
The "Stanford rooting section'' will ,
be in the background.
William Murray Timmons, direc- |
tor, who will conduct the final re- J
hearsal this evening, warns students ,
that the curtain will rise promptly
at 8:30 o'clock. If the members of
the audience are not in their seats
at that time they will miss the open
ing numbers.
