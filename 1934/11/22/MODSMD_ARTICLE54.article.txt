## 
### 
Fred Michaels, Stanford student,
nearly met death at 1:30 o'clock yes
| terday morning when his heavy
: roadster skidded across the road be
low the Stanford golf clubhouse and
I smashed â€¢ into an oak tree 20 feet
| from the highway.
Michaels is in the Palo Alto Hos
pital, under treatment for lacera
, tions of the head and various cuts
i and bruises. His injuries are de
scribed as minor.
So terrific was the impact against
the tree thaat the car was ccmplete
' ly demolished. Nevertheless, Mich-
I aels was able to walk to his frater
nity house, Phi Kappa Sigma, where
; he was taken to the hospital by a
i friend.
An investigation made by George
I Burns, campus deputy sheriff, dis
closed that the car skidded across
the wet gravel on the shoulder of
the road. Michaels was headed
toward the campus at the time and
| was traveling alone.
