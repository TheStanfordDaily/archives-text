The Editor, Sir:
In regard to your editorial on the
president of Williams College and
his refusal of SERA funds, certain
considerations arise which should be
commented upon.
In the first place, i? it worthy
either of the dignity or of the pre
sumed enlightenment of a college to
join the "gimme gang" in the face j
of the highest Federal debt in his
tory and mounting state and Federal ;
deficits? A little of the ''burning
of the lamp of knowledge" that you
speak of as flowing from the use of
SERA funds would surely demon
strate the danger of placing further
strain upon the already overbur- ,
dened Federal and state treasuries. !
In the second place, if it is "un-
American" to despise public relief, j
open or thinly veiled, and to desire j
to stand upon one's own feet, then
the great body of American people !
have been un-American from the!
landing at Jamestown to the inau- i
guration of President Roosevelt. It i
would appear reasonable, for the i
present at least, to regard the present I
attitude of mendicancy as an aber- I
ration born of the depressions, and j
not as a reversal of the American !
traditions of 300 years. Until you j
can prove it to be the latter, you !
are hardly justified in calling those!
who oppose public charity, in col
leges or elsewhere, "reactionaries"
or "un-American."

The Editor, Sir:
In Campus Opinion for today I |
read the plea written in behalf of I
the women and I thoroughly agree j
with them. They want a code. Well, j
why not give it to them? Why are ,
the men any better than the women? !
Why should they have to walk to j
Paly or take a bus when we have !
only to stand on the corner and wait j
for a lift? I believe that we should
all get together and help the poor
weaker sex in their attempt to get j
rides to and from Paly.
For instance—why can't the fel- '
lows pick up the women as well as !
the fellows, and the women do their i
part by picking up the fellows? As
for myself, I have been fortunate
enough to get rides from the women ]
as well as the fellows and I have |
also given the women rides from i
time to time. Now what do you
say we all get together and help |
each other? I for one, am willing to I
do my part and give the women i
rides if they will co-operate and |
give me rides in return.
As for the sorority women pick
ing up the frosh, well, I suppose'
that can be remedied by the sorority |
women passing up the frosh and |
picking up the fellows, and leaving J
the women to be picked up by some j
of the men.
i
I hope you will all agree with me !
and give the poor women a break
by co-operating with my plan.

of the lamp of knowledge" that you
speak of as flowing from the use of
SERA funds would surely demon

strain upon the already overbur- ,
dened Federal and state treasuries. !

American" to despise public relief, j
open or thinly veiled, and to desire j

would appear reasonable, for the i
present at least, to regard the present I
attitude of mendicancy as an aber- I
ration born of the depressions, and j
not as a reversal of the American !

In Campus Opinion for today I |
read the plea written in behalf of I
the women and I thoroughly agree j
with them. They want a code. Well, j
why not give it to them? Why are ,
the men any better than the women? !
Why should they have to walk to j
Paly or take a bus when we have !
only to stand on the corner and wait j
for a lift? I believe that we should
all get together and help the poor
weaker sex in their attempt to get j
rides to and from Paly.
For instance—why can't the fel- '
lows pick up the women as well as !
the fellows, and the women do their i
part by picking up the fellows? As
for myself, I have been fortunate
enough to get rides from the women ]
as well as the fellows and I have |
also given the women rides from i
time to time. Now what do you
say we all get together and help |
each other? I for one, am willing to I
do my part and give the women i
rides if they will co-operate and |
give me rides in return.
As for the sorority women pick
ing up the frosh, well, I suppose'
that can be remedied by the sorority |
women passing up the frosh and |
picking up the fellows, and leaving J
the women to be picked up by some j
of the men.
i
I hope you will all agree with me !
and give the poor women a break
by co-operating with my plan.
A fellow with the best intentions j

In regard to your editorial on the
president of Williams College and
his refusal of SERA funds, certain
considerations arise which should be
commented upon.
In the first place, i? it worthy
either of the dignity or of the pre
sumed enlightenment of a college to
join the "gimme gang" in the face j
of the highest Federal debt in his
