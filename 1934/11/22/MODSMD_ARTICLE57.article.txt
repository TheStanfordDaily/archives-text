# AIRPORT REMOVAL DECISION EXPECTED
## 
### 
The Palo Alto City Council is j
expected to come to a decision con- i
cerning the removal of the Palo Alto i
Airport and School of Aviation, now
located on the campus, to a new lo
cation, by the end of the week. Plans
have been made, should present ne
gotiations be completed, to move the i
entire airport and aviation school to j
a tract of land located just across!
the Bayshore Highway at the end i
of Embarcadero Road.
The removal of the airport has i
been under consideration for some i
time. Several years ago airport offi
cials commenced negotiations with !
the Palo Alto council to secure the j
proposed tract of land, but these ef- ;
forts proved useless. Recently there!
has been much opposition to the air
port by Mayfield- residents, who I
claim that the noise of the planes
is an unnecessary disturbance.
The proposed airport will be much j
larger, and the airport officials hope !
that the Mayfield opposition will aid j
them in securing the land from the |
city of Palo Alto. '
