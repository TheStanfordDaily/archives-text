# Steedman Asks Open Pay For Needy Athletes
## Chappie Editor Says Subsidization Should Be Brought Into Open; Favors Flat Hourly Rate For Time Spent in Athletic Practice 
### IRVIN JORGENSON 
The jester doffs his cap and bells. In the Big Game edition of Chap
arral, published yesterday, Editor Gordon Steedman in a serious discus
sion of the athletic situation existing in colleges, proposes to pay needy
athletes for the time they spend in practice.
Steedman says: "The line between amateurism and professionalism,
today, is a vague one. Could no* the officials make some equitable adjust-

ment w.hcreby athletes would be
paid a flat hourly rate equal to the
standard university pay, for the
hours they spend in practice?
"By such a plan, the Old Boy
believes, there would be less dis
crimination, scholarships could be
left to open competition, need could
be openly and fairly met, and the
realities recognized with justice and
without hypocrisy."
Pay Needed
The need for paying some ath
letes is great, he thinks. "There
are many students attending uni
versities who must support them
selves and pay their tuition. Men
engaged in sports bringing in
large revenues must put in an
amount of time practicing and
playing easily equal to that spent
by a non-athlete earning his
way through school.
"There have been many instances
where the athlete was faced with !
three alternatives: earn his living,
play football, or study. A Stanford
football captain not long ago was
faced by these three alterntives. He
earned his living and played foot
ball. The two took all his time. He
flunked out.
Many Left Out
"Many .students who must support |
themselves could be out for sports i
but have not the time — they must'
work to keep themselves. Some are j
able to work and still compete for ;
scholarships—just as some athletes j
are able to play and win scholar- |
ships in competition.
"Why not recognize athletes on
the same basis? Is there any in
nate difference between the man
who spends his time working at
odd jobs and the man who spends j
his time working at athlctics?"
Steedman recognizes the difficulty ;
in putting his plan into operation, j
In a statement given to The Daily j
yesterday he foresees several difTi- j
culties. "My plan would require !
that a distinction be made between j
the athlete who must have financial j
assistance and the one who does not I
need it. It would be necessary to
work out some system whereby the J
player would not go out for a sport j
merely for the financial remunera- I
tion. I think the coach could attend i
to this difficulty.
