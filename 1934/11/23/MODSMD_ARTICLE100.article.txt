# INDIAN SQUAD CONFIDENT ON EVE OF BEAR CLASSIC
## 
### 
Radiating confidence, not over
-1 confidence, and lots of respect for the
! Golden Bears, Stanford's 1934 Big
I Red Machine is entering the final
! nerve-raking day before the fortieth
! Annual Big Game in Berkeley to
morrow in as calm a manner as any
participants in the' yearly classic
have for many years.
A concensus of opinion among the
I Cardinal players clearly shows thio
confidence, but the general idea
seems that the Big Game will still be
the biggest game of the Indian
schedule.
Some of the comments:
; Acting-Captain Bones Hamilton,
j light half—Our running attack will

J go with the help of passes to open it
up. We can win.
Bobby Grayson, fullback, who
will call the signals for Stanford—
They'll be tough but we'll beat
them. Our running attack will
work, and we may not pass, but
wc can if we need to. Both teams
will play their best ball of the
season. Rain would hurt them be
cause they will have to depend on
passes and we won't.
Buck Van Dellen, left half—l
don't think California will score.
It'll be much the same type of a
game as the U.S.F. and Santa
Clara games, except that both
teams will play better ball.
Bob Maentz, left half—lt'll be a
tougher game than last year.
Attack Will Work

running attack will go, but we prob
ably will not pass much. We should
win, but it will be the toughest game
on the schedule.
Wes Mullcr. center—We should
win. I don't know by how much
or how little, but we should put

Monk Moscrip, left end —Califor-
