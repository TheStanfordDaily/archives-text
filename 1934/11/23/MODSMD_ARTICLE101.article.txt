# FUTURE OF INGRAM AS CAL COACH AT STAKE TOMORROW
## Potentially Strong Squad Unproven This Year 
### 
Poor Bill!
This saying is vastly replacing
that of "Poor Cal." After all, out
siders say that Bill Ingram, coach
of the Golden Bears, has been tak
ing more of a beating than his team
has.
California's showing in the Big
Game tomorrow will probably have
a great deal of bearing on Ingram's
future coaching plans. Yapped at
for the past three years by a whole
pack of wolves, when everyone else
only had one at their door, Navy
Bill's team holds his fate in their
hands.
Pre-season dope placed the Bears
as one of the potential strong teams
on the Coast. But when they lost to
St. Mary's and almost did the same
to Pacific, the anvil chorus com
menced anew.
The Bears win over U.S.C. and
Idaho have appeased the wrathful
somewhat, but if the Cards should
happen to completely humble the
Californians tomorrow, the boom is
liable to be lowered on Bill. Past
showings of Ingram-coachcd teams
against Stanford do not indicate that
this will be so.
In three years the Indians have
only scored seven points against the
Bears and that was last year via the
passing route. So the fact remains
that the Ingrain-coached lines have
remained intact before the last three
Cardinal attacks. Whether it will be
the same tomorrow is another story.
The chorus bases its tune on the
final score, however, and that has not
been too much in Ingram's favor. In
other words the Big Game can make
or break the Cal coach. A big score
against the Bears will mean the
probability that his contract will be
broken. The Indians seem to be in
a position to run up a score.
