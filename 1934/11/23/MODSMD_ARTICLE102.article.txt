out" California squad that may
look like a high school team one
Saturday and a polished outfit
seven days later.
Only one factor has instilled any
hope at all into the average Califor
nia supporter: that the Bears seem
to have begun a belated but unmis
! takable improvement that may pos
; sibly take them over the top against
; Stanford.
The first signs of this material im
provement were noted against U.S.C.
in Los Angeles two weeks ago when,
I for the first time, Coach Bill In
gram's charges demonstrated that
; they could block, tackle, and sustain
I a touchdown march if they set their
; minds to it.
A week later, Idaho came to Ber
j keley, boasting a powerful line and
an efficient passing attack. After
getting off to a bad start, the Bears
came baclc in the middle of tjie first
| quarter to out-pass, out-maneuver,
i out-charge, and out-score the Van
dals in such a decisive manner that
former California bleacher ''wolves"
for the first time really pointed with
| pride to the team and said, "This is
1 what we've been looking for all
year."
There is no assurance, however,
that continued improvement will be
of any avail against the Cardinals.
Apparently, judging from statistics
| and cold scores and figures, the In-
I dians have everything it takes to
produce an eleven that will go down
in history as a real champion and
worthy representative for the West
j at the Rose Bowl.
The Bear mentor's decision to start
Bert Welch at quarterback almost
; broke Big Game precedent. Two
| weeks ago, Wclch was a sigal-caller
on the Rambler squad. Tomorrow,
the fate of the Bear offense will rest
in his hands, as he takes over the
most important assignment he ever
I encountered. Welch demonstrated
his ability as a blocker, passer, and
J field general in the Idaho game. He
j replaces little Monty Reedy.
Dependable Capiain Arleigh Wil
liams will take the field in the left
I halfback position. Arleigh, a "mon
ey" player if there ever was one, will
, be playing in his third and last Big
| Game. If there is anyone who can
turn the tide of battle in favor of
j the Blue and Gold, it is Arleigh, an
I all-around player in any man's lan
| guagc.
Chuck Cotton and Ken Moeller
will complete the starting backfield
by filling the fullback and right half
back posts respectively.
• In the line, Ingram will start those
I players "who have showed they want
to play football." They arc Russ
1 Calkins, center; Crosby Beedy and
Louis Drnovich, guards; Ray Nord
strom and Dave Anderson, tackles;
and Jack and Bob Brittinghain, ends.
Armed with this more or less un
tried team, and sure of (fnly one
thing—that God-given inspiration to
play over their heads and plenty of
breaks will have to be present in
order to win—Bill Ingram will flip
his fourth, and perhaps final, Cali
fornia coin and await the all-impor
' lanl answer. What will it be?
