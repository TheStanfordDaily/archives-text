# TINY CHUCKLES, REFUSES TO TALK ON PROSPECTS
## 
### HERB DIAMOND 
"Prospects, eh? Well, I'll have a
team out on the field —it'll be up to
! them to do the rest."

So chuckled big, good - natured
• Coach Tiny Thornhill as he finished
I lacing his shoe and made for the
| gridiron where he and his assistants
were to put the Indians through an
| other practice sessions in prepara
tion for the Big Game.
' "The boys are in great condi
tion, too. There just won't he
any sick list," he added emphati
cally.
And there you have something.
! Never before in modern Stanford
| history have the Cardinals been in
| better physical condition for a Big
i Game. At present Stanford is the
! only team on the Coast which hasn't
1 been weakened somewhat by a
lengthy hospital list.
During the past week the squad
| has seen very little or no practice
scrimmage; the stress has come on
passing and plenty of running plays.
The Cards, you know, with a power
i house of a forward wall and smash
ing backs have been plowing through
many a team during the season and
to change their plunging technique
right now to an aerial attack would
involve plenty of risk. The idea,
however, seems to center not on a
change in style of offense but more
on the rounding out and balancing of
• offensive efficiency.
The Indians have power; they've
proved that in every game. The
j Indians also can pass; they proved
that in two of their scores against
| the Olympic Club last Saturday.
Nevertheless Tiny says he's tak
ing no chances and he means it.
He watched plenty of subs under
! action in the Olympic Club tilt and

"they played mighty good football,"
he says.
Among the more outstanding men
he lists Carlson at tackle; Cooke, a
guard, in his first varsity game; An
derson at full and quarter; Wil
liams at half; Reisner, halfback; and
five ends—Schott, Monsalve, Trom
pas, Clark, and Mangan.
"The Olympic Club was a fair
test in the first half for the In
dians," Thornhill finally went on,
"as they're older and more expe
rienced men. By the second half,
however, they apparently became
worn out and didn't offer so much
opposition."
That lack of opposition on the
Club's part seems to have been
caused by the activities of the Cards,
and Tiny knows it. Overconfidencc,
however, is a team's greatest en
emy, and with everything else in
readiness, Thornhill constantly
guards against it.
Of course, passes and several new
running attacks are devices which
have featured practice during the
past week and which Coach Tiny
may haul out at any moment to
morrow. He has the plays, and what
is more he has every one of his men
in the best of condition to stage them
—all of which will only serve to
make things generally more inter
esting. The importance of condi
tion cannot be overestimated, for it
served California almost to the ad
vantage of smacking the Cards in
the closing minute of play last year.
You may gather then that the
prospect which now faces Mr. C. E.
Thornhill is not exactly unpleasant.
And unless some unforeseen acci
dent occurs before tomorrow it will
remain so.

derson at full and quarter; Wil
liams at half; Reisner, halfback; and
five ends—Schott, Monsalve, Trom
pas, Clark, and Mangan.
"The Olympic Club was a fair
test in the first half for the In
dians," Thornhill finally went on,
"as they're older and more expe
rienced men. By the second half,
however, they apparently became
worn out and didn't offer so much
opposition."
That lack of opposition on the
Club's part seems to have been
caused by the activities of the Cards,
and Tiny knows it. Overconfidencc,
however, is a team's greatest en
emy, and with everything else in
readiness, Thornhill constantly
guards against it.
Of course, passes and several new
running attacks are devices which
have featured practice during the
past week and which Coach Tiny
may haul out at any moment to
morrow. He has the plays, and what
is more he has every one of his men
in the best of condition to stage them
—all of which will only serve to
make things generally more inter
esting. The importance of condi
tion cannot be overestimated, for it
served California almost to the ad
vantage of smacking the Cards in
the closing minute of play last year.
You may gather then that the
prospect which now faces Mr. C. E.
Thornhill is not exactly unpleasant.
And unless some unforeseen acci
dent occurs before tomorrow it will
remain so.
"Prospects, eh? Well, I'll have a
team out on the field —it'll be up to
! them to do the rest."

So chuckled big, good - natured
• Coach Tiny Thornhill as he finished
I lacing his shoe and made for the

were to put the Indians through an

And there you have something.
! Never before in modern Stanford
| history have the Cardinals been in
| better physical condition for a Big
i Game. At present Stanford is the
! only team on the Coast which hasn't
1 been weakened somewhat by a
lengthy hospital list.
During the past week the squad
| has seen very little or no practice
scrimmage; the stress has come on
passing and plenty of running plays.
The Cards, you know, with a power
i house of a forward wall and smash
ing backs have been plowing through
many a team during the season and
to change their plunging technique
right now to an aerial attack would
involve plenty of risk. The idea,
however, seems to center not on a
change in style of offense but more
on the rounding out and balancing of
• offensive efficiency.
The Indians have power; they've
proved that in every game. The
j Indians also can pass; they proved
that in two of their scores against
| the Olympic Club last Saturday.
Nevertheless Tiny says he's tak
ing no chances and he means it.
He watched plenty of subs under
! action in the Olympic Club tilt and

"they played mighty good football,"
he says.
Among the more outstanding men
he lists Carlson at tackle; Cooke, a
guard, in his first varsity game; An
derson at full and quarter; Wil
liams at half; Reisner, halfback; and
five ends—Schott, Monsalve, Trom
pas, Clark, and Mangan.
