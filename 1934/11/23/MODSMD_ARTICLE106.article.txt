# CARD TEAM CALM DURING FINAL PRACTICE SESSIONS
## 
### 
The Stanford varsity's past week
of practice for tomorrow's Big Game
has been marked by a spirit of con
fidence and preparations similar to
those used for every other game this
season.
The Indians intend to play the
same brand of football that they
have displayed against U.C.L.A.,
Washington, and the Olympic Club
the preceding three Saturdays, and
they feel that this football is good
enough to beat Cal.
Running plays and passes have
been given the usual amount of
drill for the necessary coordina
tion and precision. Coach Tiny
Thornhill has added several new
plays to those used against the
Olympic Club. There has been no
scrimmage, not even of the dummy
type.
Thornhill has instructed the var
sity of a defense against the Cali
fornia running attack.
Pass defense, stressed several
weeks ago because of a feared weak
ness in this department, has not
received more than ordinary atten
tion because of the ball-hawking
which the Card defense has dis
played against Washington and the
Olympic Club.
With the exception of Bob Black's
weak ankle, sprained in the Wash
ington game two weeks ago, the
varsity has appeared in tip-top shape
during the final workout. Woody
Adams' injured jaw is expected to
be fully healed, and Bobby Gray
son's abdominal injury, which kept
him on the bench last Saturday, will
not handicap the Boomer tomorrow.
