) Not only is the Rose Bowl bid j
j waiting for the outcome of football j
I games this Saturday, but also the j
Pacific Coast Conference title rests
| upon the results of the Stanford
: California and the Washington State- j
j Washington games.
At present Washington State and
; Stanford are in a tie for first place
I with four wins each and no defeats.
I Should the Cougars lose to Wash
i ington and the Indians win over
j California the title will go to Stan
: ford with five victories and no losses.
In the event that both W.S.C. and
i the Cards score a victory the Con
' ference standings will end in a two
; way tie.
On the other hand if Stanford
I loses its last game and the Pullman
I team wins, the Cougars will take the
j title. And again if both leaders lose
this Saturday the title will be tied
iup between Stanford, Washington
| State, California, and Washington.
| Yes, the Golden Bears are that
i close, with three Conference wins
i and only one defeat. A victory over
! Stanford will mean a chance for a
j tie for first place in the Coast race.
Oregon with a schedule of six Con
| fcrence games seems almost assured
! of at least a tie for third place. They
: have won four and lost two.
U.S.C. and U.C.L.A. are next in
| line with one win and three defeats,
i The Bruins have one Conference
, game left, with Oregon State, who
j are holding down the cellar position
| along with Montana. The Trojans
' also have one remaining Coast game,
■ with the Washington Huskies. Idaho
remains in next to last position with
: one win and four defeats.
It is all very complicated with out
' ! come of first place being decided this
I week-end. Should the race develop
1 into a four-way tie the only thing
that could break it would be a Troy
' victory over the Huskies on Decem
' ber. The way it looks now Stanford
' i will either win the title or tie with
