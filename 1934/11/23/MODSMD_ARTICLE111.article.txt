# CUDDEBACK, HUNT SCOUT OPPONENTS
## 
### 
"One thing you don't want to do
i in scouting is watch the ball car
rier!" At least so says head Indian
j scout, Murray Cuddeback, who has
J spent most of the current football
J season traveling over the United
States getting the "low down" on
Stanford's grid opponents.
Cuddeback and his diminutive
scouting partner, Husky Hunt, have
both covered a lot of territory in the
last few weeks. Hunt's travels have
I taken him to Berkeley, Seattle, and
| Los Angeles, where he has seen
three of the Cardinal adversaries
I play.
Scout Cuddeback's journeys have
taken him even farther. One trip,
taking three weeks, started with
Cuddeback trekking to Corvallis for
the Oregon State-U.S.F. tilt and
thence to Portland to see U.C.L.A.
! meet Oregon. From there he went
eastward, stopping at Chicago to see
j Northwestern play and continuing to
Pittsburgh to see that school in
! action.
We've worked up a printed form,
I explained Hunt in response to a
i query as to just how the scouts could
keep tab on all the points of a team.
JWe check for their strength and
weakness and get the individual
dope on every player they have, he
volunteered further.
California has been the object of
Cardinal scouts attentions this year.
Together they have seen the Blue
j and Gold in action six different
j times. "Tiny" Thornhill's special
agents can tell him practically all
there is to know about the Bear
! eleven.
Stanford's scouting system is said
to be the least expensive of all
league schools some of which keep
j a scout covering each of their op
ponents continually.
