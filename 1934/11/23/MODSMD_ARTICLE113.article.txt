What are some of the permanent |
values to be derived from playing*
football?
Dr. Thomas A. Storey, general di
rector of the School of Hygiene and
Physical Education, and director of
athletics, makes some observations
on this query.
"A game or sport of youth or early j
maturity, such as football, is among
the most powerful—if not the most,
powerful—of the influences that con- j
tribute to the development and j
maintenance of the bodies of the;
participants, that mould minds and
shape personalities.
"Football training at Stanford is I
calculated to stimulate the growth j
and development of both body and
mind. Such activities often deter- j
mine or condition the degree of per- ]
sonal and social integration, and:
often the success which the individ- ,
ual afterwards makes in life.
"Football should be played in the j
true sense of the word. Lack of j
mental health will be the downfall .
of a football team. Mental worry
causes a team to be emotionally up- i
set and ruins the group. 'Old Man
Psychology' is a myjor factor in de
ciding the game of health as well as
the game of football.
"Social health for the team is just
as important as physical and mental

With a socially healthy per
sonality, each man subordinates j
himself to the good of the team,!
strictly playing only his own part.'
in offense and defense. It means the
player is not self-centered.
"If a man breaks rules he be
comes anti-social and may shatter j
the effectiveness of the team. On
the other hand, the man on the team
who retires within himself so that he j
does not share his part of team- 1
responsibility has an a-social or even
anti-social complex.
"Any one who is leading a group |
of men can not but be conscious of
the fact that physical, mental and
social behavior constitute health in
its major concept.
"Other factors must be taken into '
account which counterbalance some :
of the favorable results derived from
playing football. Athletic injuries,
and hazards of a deleterious or even
vicious influence, are all a part of
the education given by football.
"I can name a number of outstand- .
ing business men, bankers, lawyers, i
and engineers who were footbaii j
players during their college days,"
concludes Dr. Storey, "and they have
made really remarkable successes in j
life. On the gridiron they learned
the principles of clean fighting and
dynamic competition.
