# TRADITIONAL GRID TILTS HOLD SWAY ON NATION'S CARD
## 
### 
Tomorrow will be a day of big
games all over the country as well
as here on the Pacific slope.
Back in Harvard Stadium the
Crimson Warriors battle the Yale
Bulldogs. No matter how poor either
or both of these teams may be, this
struggle is always a first-rate battle.
Yale, fresh from its 7-0 upset of
Princeton, stands to win its first Big
Three Championship in many years,
i Harvard, having already lost to the
Tigers of Princeton, does not loom
; tough enough to be&t the boys from
New Haven.
Big Ten Battle
Probably the next best battle and
certainly one that means more to
! the national scheme of things will be
the battle for the Big Ten Cham
pionship between Minnesota and
Wisconsin.
The Gophers have swept all oppo
i sition aside this season and are well
on the way to a national champion
ship. The Badgers have no such
record, but they may be very tough
this Saturday. Minnesota should
have enough to win after a real
battle.
Down South, the Crimson Tide of
i Alabama has a free week-end be
fore tackling the Commodores of
Vanderbilt on Thanksgiving. That
game 'may decide the Rose Bowl
! choice.

Out here two of the best teanfs on
the Coast will battle for the North
ern Conference championship. Wash
ington, beaten only by Stanford, will
tackle Washington State in the game
that will decide the Pacific Coast
Conference championship.
If Washington State can beat
Washington, the Cougars will end in
a tie for Conference honors with
Stanford, provided the Cards trim
California. The Huskies have a
flashing attack and with a dry field
should have enough to take Babe
Hollingberry's team by a narrow
margin.
Ramblers, Cadets Meet
Another titanic struggle is on tap
for the fans when Army and Notre
Dame tangle. These two teams, al
ways so evenly matched, again ap
pear to be a toss up. Last year Notre
Dame closed a disastrous season with
a 13-12 win over a great Army team
in one of the nation's biggest upsets.
Comparative scores point to an
other close contest, but the Army
boys remember lust year's game and
will be out to wipe out that old
score. They have "Texas Jack"
Buckler, an All-American back,
who may be the deciding factor in a
close game.
Pop Warner's Temple Owls, pow
ered by the smashing Smuckler,
ranked by Pop as a second Ernie
Nevers, tackle Harry Stuhldreher's
Villanova Wildcats. Temple is one
of the unbeaten teams in the coun
try and should have little trouble
in beating Villanovu.
