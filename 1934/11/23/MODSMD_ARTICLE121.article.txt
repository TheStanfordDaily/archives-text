## 
### 
NEW YORK, Nov. 22 l/Pl.â€”lf, us
row appears likely, Yale scales the
championship heights of the old
Big Three by beating Harvard this
Saturday at New Haven, it can be
said with finality that the current
"iron men" of old Eli have started a
brand new era in football for the
blue.
' The eleven conquerors of Prince
ton typify an elemental surge that
Yale hasn't known in years. In fact,
they have had to go all the way
: back to the bewhiskered, power
house days of '88 to find another Eli
i team that went through an entire
: game without making a substitu
j tion.
The cheering team at University of
Kentucky must take a six weeks'
i training course in tumbling.
