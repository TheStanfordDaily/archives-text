# HISTORY RECALLS CLASSIC 20-20 TIE OF 10 YEARS AGO
## Cuddeback Remembered As Hero of '24 Game 
### 
Ten years ago yesterday Stanford
and California played the classic of |
recent Big Games, *he famous 20-2U j
tie.
Cal was doped to win that game, j
with Stanford's All-American full- !
back, Ernie Nevers, out with a
ltroken ankle, and Pop Warner's
passer and punter, Norm Cleave-'
land, declared ineligible on the j
eve of the game. Cal did justify |
I lie predictions of the dopestcrs
for 55 minutes, for with hut live I
minutes to go and the crowd al- J
ready beginning to leave the sta- I
dium the Cards were trailing 20-6.
Then Murray Cuddeback started
tossing pusses. One clicked foi' a
touchdown, and Cuddeback con
verted. Another series of passes, a
Cuddeback conversion, and the
Cards had pulled the ball game out
of the fire. The fans have been stay
ing to see the last minute of big
games ever since.
Cards Repeat in '28
Again in 1928 Stanford gained a
lie with a thrilling finish. With but J
ii minute to go, Bill Simpkins passed j
to Lud Frentrup for the score that j
gave the Cards a 13-13 tie.
In 192.9 Stanford won 20-13, due
mainly to the line-plunging of ;
Chuck Smalling and the pass- j
snagging of Captain "Mush" Mill- ]
ler. A record for Big Game scores j
was set in 1930 when Stanford !
justified its position as heavy fa- i
vorites by whipping the Bears ,
41-0.
Then came lean years. Cal won |
in '31, 6-0. In '32 Stanford camc |
within an ace of scoring in the first i
quarter, then came as close to losing ,
in the fourth quarter when Hank:
Schaldach drove California 00 yards <.
down the field in the final few mill- ;
utes. The gun saved a 0-0 tie for,
Stanford.
Last year found Stanford coming j
to the top of the cycle again. Thf 1 ■
game was not won until the fourth'
quarter, however, with the Alustiz'-i j
to Norgard passing combination;
going for 70 yards and the only score !
of the game.

I lie predictions of the dopestcrs
for 55 minutes, for with hut live I

dium the Cards were trailing 20-6.
Then Murray Cuddeback started
tossing pusses. One clicked foi' a
touchdown, and Cuddeback con
verted. Another series of passes, a
Cuddeback conversion, and the
Cards had pulled the ball game out

ing to see the last minute of big
games ever since.
Cards Repeat in '28
Again in 1928 Stanford gained a
lie with a thrilling finish. With but J
ii minute to go, Bill Simpkins passed j
to Lud Frentrup for the score that j
gave the Cards a 13-13 tie.
In 192.9 Stanford won 20-13, due
mainly to the line-plunging of ;
Chuck Smalling and the pass- j
snagging of Captain "Mush" Mill- ]
ler. A record for Big Game scores j
was set in 1930 when Stanford !
justified its position as heavy fa- i
vorites by whipping the Bears ,
41-0.
Then came lean years. Cal won |
in '31, 6-0. In '32 Stanford camc |
within an ace of scoring in the first i
quarter, then came as close to losing ,
in the fourth quarter when Hank:
Schaldach drove California 00 yards <.
down the field in the final few mill- ;
utes. The gun saved a 0-0 tie for,
Stanford.
Last year found Stanford coming j
to the top of the cycle again. Thf 1 ■
game was not won until the fourth'
quarter, however, with the Alustiz'-i j
to Norgard passing combination;
going for 70 yards and the only score !
of the game.

Cards Repeat in '28
Again in 1928 Stanford gained a
lie with a thrilling finish. With but J
ii minute to go, Bill Simpkins passed j
to Lud Frentrup for the score that j
gave the Cards a 13-13 tie.
In 192.9 Stanford won 20-13, due
mainly to the line-plunging of ;
Chuck Smalling and the pass- j
snagging of Captain "Mush" Mill- ]
ler. A record for Big Game scores j
was set in 1930 when Stanford !
justified its position as heavy fa- i
vorites by whipping the Bears ,
41-0.
Then came lean years. Cal won |
in '31, 6-0. In '32 Stanford camc |
within an ace of scoring in the first i
quarter, then came as close to losing ,
in the fourth quarter when Hank:
Schaldach drove California 00 yards <.
down the field in the final few mill- ;
utes. The gun saved a 0-0 tie for,
Stanford.
Last year found Stanford coming j
to the top of the cycle again. Thf 1 ■
game was not won until the fourth'
quarter, however, with the Alustiz'-i j
to Norgard passing combination;
going for 70 yards and the only score !
of the game.
