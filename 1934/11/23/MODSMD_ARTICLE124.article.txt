# The 						Stanford Axe
## It's Big Game Trophy Now 
### 

After it's all over tomorrow, the Stanford Axe will settle down in either Berkeley or the Union Cellar for a year. By comparison with former experiences, this year's struggle for possession of the Axe will be
easy. It will last hut 6(1 minutes and there will be only 22 people actively in the argument. Its history is well known. The Axe was California property for .'ii years, following its theft from a Stanford rally in 18'J!,'.
It changed hands in 1930 when the "immortal twenty-one" succeeded in their plot to recapture it. Last year it started on the latest phase of its history when it became a Big Game trophy. A 7 to 3 victory gave
Stanford possession for the first year.
