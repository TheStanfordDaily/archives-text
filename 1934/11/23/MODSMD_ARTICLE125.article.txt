# BEARS ON SPOT AS BERKELEY CITIZENS' CONFIDENCE WANES
## 
### Warren Breed 
A note of doubt hangs over the
little college town of Berkeley. Citi
zens there want to say that Cal is ;
going to win, but they haven't the ;
conviction.
There are, of course, those vener
able old patriarchs of way back
when, who have noised about the
certainty of a Bear victory for so long
that they don't know how 1o say
anything else.
A certain Sather Gate campus j
merchant says, "Oh, yes, a Berkeley I
victory will be no surprise to us j
fans. We have confidence in Navy !
Bill, and besides, look at Santa I
Clara."
The general opinion, however, is J
a whole-hearted respect for the run
ning attack of the Big Red Machine. j
They generally follow the city news
papers in their beliefs anyway, so !
are inclined to think twice about I
picking the Bears.
Students up at the State Univer
sity find it hard to get away from j
the old cocky, thi'eadbare angle of
"cinch win for us," and "never heard
of Stanford"—they find consolation j
in laughing it off.
When it comes to placing a bet, j
however, there is not so much of the :
gusto on the Cal side. They have i
everything to win and nothing to
lose, except if they do happen to
make a litter wager on the side.
Of course the Berkeleyites are not ;
conceding a cinch loss until the game j
is over. They have seen other fa
vored teams take drubbings, and re- !
puted weak teams rise to the occa- j
sion and whip out a victory. They i
still see hope in life.
Stanford's defensive record is the j
big thing, although not recognized so j
widely as the powerhouse all-star
backfield.
Yes, you say, as you drive down ;
Telegraph to Oakland, the Bears are j
on the spot. They are supposed to j
put up at least a fighting team, j
against us, but it is still—Poor Cal.
