# Comparison Shows 1935 Bear, Card Teams Even
## 
### ROGER KIMBALL 
Popular opinion, as it is at |
| this early date, favors Stanford to
win next year's Big Game on the
Farm by a still greater margin than
j that given to the Indians for tomor
row's contest. The fact that nearly
all of the Cardinal stars of this sea
son are juniors may be good reason
for that outlook, if the situation of
; California is completely ignored.
Most of the Bear regulars have
another year of competition, too,
i and many of their leading players
| are only sophomores. The addition
of numerous gridders from a really
great frosh eleven, which trounced
the Papooses, 39 to 0, will make the
19.'J5 California team potentially
the strongest since the Golden
Bears played in the Rose Bowl six
years ago.
Monk.Moscrip and Keith Topping,
; Stanford's fine ends, both return for
another season, and will again be
backed up by Jack Clark and Alex
Trompas. California will also show
great strength at the flank positions,
j since the Brittingham brothers, Bob
: and Jack, and Ritchie Hay ajl have
: another year.
Stanford will present two strong
| candidates for all-American tackles
next year in Bob Reynolds and Cab
Callaway. Larry Lutz of California
I has another year, and will rival Rey-
I nolds and Callaway for national rec
: ognition. Dave Anderson and Nord-
I strom of the present Bear varsity will
: fight for the other tackle post.
Both Larry Rouble and Woody
i Adams, the "five-and-ten boys" of
j the Indian varsity, will return as
' seniors next fall. Jack Walton and
Bob Black would make the first team
on most squads right now, and
i should be still better in 1935, threat
; ening Adams and Rouble for their
[ positions. The Golden Bears will also
be strong at the guard posts next
year, with Conrad Tenney and Cros
; by Beedy, this season's regulars, re
turning.
Two of the Coast's leading cen
ters this year, Wes Muller of the
| Cardinals and Russ Calkins of the
Bears, have another season before
them, and both should attain wide
| recognition. Calkins, possibly the
best pivot man in the Conference,
rates the edge, hut Stanford should
make up for it with Alf Brandin
and Neils Larson, semi-regulars all
1 this year, again hacking up Muller
j in 1935.
Stone of the present California
varsity and Captain Bo!) Herwig
of the Bear cubs are both figured
as better than Nellie Heath of the
| '34 Papooses.
j Frank ' outstanding quar
terback this year, returns for another
I season, and will go capable support
from Earl Hoos, Ed Gillette and Bill
Roberts of the frosh. Monty Reedy,
I who has been playing this position
recently for the Bears, is graduating,
bat Bill Archer and Jim Carlyon will
i compete with Meek of the '34 Bear
Cubs for the job.
Two alternating left halfbacks,
Buck Van Dellen and Bob Maentz.
are both playing their final season for
j Stanford. Johnny Reisner and Fred
j Williams will compete with Jimmy
Colli,s and "Doc" Luckett, two aces of
the 1934 Papooses, for this post.
The Bears will lose Arleigh Wil
liams, but they will retain Floyd
Blower, star of the 1933 Eig Game.
Chili Sertoli, whose three years at
California have comprised one long
I run of tough luck, may be allowed
another year of play.
One of the greatest halfbacks in
the country this year should help
lead Stanford to gridiron victories
( in 1935 when Bones Hamilton re
t turns for his final season at right
half. Gordon Head, Bones' had
ing substitute at present, and Tom
Collins and Leo Madlem of the
| 19I!4 freshmen will make things
tough for the Golden Bear next
year.
Great as a frosh halfback, better
as a varsity fullback last season, and
rising to new heights this year, Bob
I Grayson will return as a senior next
I fall. Chuck Ledbetter and Ray Todd
will again act as his understudies
with Bill pQulman and Glenn Hamil
ton coming up from the frosh.
