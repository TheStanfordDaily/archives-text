# SUPER EDITION OF GAIETIES IS READY TONIGHT
## Cast of 100 Will Perform For Student-Written Variety Program 
### 
The annual one-night stand of the
Big Game Gaieties will be presented
in the Assembly Hall at 8:30 o'clock
tonight. The 1934 model of the one
student-written show of the year,
which this time is worked out on a
newspaper idea, is planned to be a
super edition.
Although the production has been
"a director's nightmare," according
to William Murray Timmons, super
vising director, it promises to be a
gala show for the capacity audience
which Dick Frank, dramatic mana
ger, expects will attend.
Use Newspaper Idea
A cast of over 100 students will
take part in the variety show of
chorus and solo dancing, humorous
sketches, songs, black - outs, and
gags. Gordon Stee»dman, inspired
"Chappie" editor, has written a con
tinuity for the Gaieties which will
do .away with the usual master of
ceremonies. The action takes place
in a newspaper office. Principal
characters are the editor-in-chief
and his departmental heads.
The chorus, which observers say
is the best - looking and the best
trained to appear on a Stanford stage
in some years, is under the direction
of Hestor Beaudoin, a newcomer to
the Gaieties' technical staff. The
twelve girls are supported by a cho-

rus of six men. Specially numbers,
ranging from a "farm" dance and a
slow-motion number to a "hands
hat-shoes-shuffle," are interspersed
throughout the show. Harriette Hall
Kilby, star of "One Sunday After
noon," has replaced Rosemary Sis
trom in the chorus.
Talent Varied
Gordon Heche, music director,
who reports that this year more
tunes and lyrics were submitted to
'iim than during any previous year,
has his 12-piece band primed to
furnish lively musical accompani
ment to the show. Musical scores
been arranged by Pete Knecht.
Heading the group of actors to ap
pear tonight are such veterans of
the Stanford stage as Kay Arthur,
Jean Albertson, Harriette Hall Kil
by, Shelly Smith, Winstead Weaver,
Jim Copp, Phil Brown, Gordon
Steedman, and Lloyd Philips.
Ernie Heckscher, Norman Sears,
and AI Trelear are among the sing
ers and instrumentalists of experi
ence who will entertain tonight.
Those "in the know" predict that
the Stanford Men's Glee Club skit
will be one of the high spots of the
evening.
Houses and organizations which
are competing for the Ram's Head
plaque, awarded to the skit receiv
ing the most applause, include Pi
Beta Phi, Chi Psi, Alpha Sigma Phi,
Delta Delta Delta, Union, Masquers,
Alpha Phi, and Phi Kappa Sigma.
Settings Effective
George Andrieni, technical direc
tor, and his staff of assistants have
worked out stage settings, colorful
and effective in their simplicity,
which will be changed often and
quickly. There will be no waits, he
promises, in this year's extravaganza
program. In an opening number the
"Stanford rooting section" will be
reproduced on the stage. Members
of the chorus will appear in white
turtle-neck sweaters and red trunks.
An adequate broadcasting system
has been installed. Vocalists will no
longer have to strain their voices to
be heard.
The box office will be open at 7
o'clock, the Assembly Hall at 7:45
o'clock.

is the best - looking and the best
trained to appear on a Stanford stage
in some years, is under the direction
of Hestor Beaudoin, a newcomer to
the Gaieties' technical staff. The
twelve girls are supported by a cho-

rus of six men. Specially numbers,
ranging from a "farm" dance and a
slow-motion number to a "hands
hat-shoes-shuffle," are interspersed
throughout the show. Harriette Hall
Kilby, star of "One Sunday After
noon," has replaced Rosemary Sis
trom in the chorus.
Talent Varied
Gordon Heche, music director,
who reports that this year more
tunes and lyrics were submitted to
'iim than during any previous year,
has his 12-piece band primed to
furnish lively musical accompani
ment to the show. Musical scores
been arranged by Pete Knecht.
Heading the group of actors to ap
pear tonight are such veterans of
the Stanford stage as Kay Arthur,
Jean Albertson, Harriette Hall Kil
by, Shelly Smith, Winstead Weaver,
Jim Copp, Phil Brown, Gordon
Steedman, and Lloyd Philips.
Ernie Heckscher, Norman Sears,
and AI Trelear are among the sing
ers and instrumentalists of experi
ence who will entertain tonight.
Those "in the know" predict that
the Stanford Men's Glee Club skit
will be one of the high spots of the
evening.
Houses and organizations which
are competing for the Ram's Head
plaque, awarded to the skit receiv
ing the most applause, include Pi
Beta Phi, Chi Psi, Alpha Sigma Phi,
Delta Delta Delta, Union, Masquers,
Alpha Phi, and Phi Kappa Sigma.
Settings Effective
George Andrieni, technical direc
tor, and his staff of assistants have
worked out stage settings, colorful
and effective in their simplicity,
which will be changed often and
quickly. There will be no waits, he
promises, in this year's extravaganza
program. In an opening number the
"Stanford rooting section" will be
reproduced on the stage. Members
of the chorus will appear in white
turtle-neck sweaters and red trunks.
An adequate broadcasting system
has been installed. Vocalists will no
longer have to strain their voices to
be heard.
The box office will be open at 7
o'clock, the Assembly Hall at 7:45
o'clock.
The annual one-night stand of the
Big Game Gaieties will be presented
in the Assembly Hall at 8:30 o'clock
tonight. The 1934 model of the one
student-written show of the year,
which this time is worked out on a
newspaper idea, is planned to be a
super edition.
Although the production has been
"a director's nightmare," according
to William Murray Timmons, super
vising director, it promises to be a
gala show for the capacity audience
which Dick Frank, dramatic mana
ger, expects will attend.
Use Newspaper Idea
A cast of over 100 students will
take part in the variety show of
chorus and solo dancing, humorous
sketches, songs, black - outs, and
gags. Gordon Stee»dman, inspired
"Chappie" editor, has written a con
tinuity for the Gaieties which will
do .away with the usual master of
ceremonies. The action takes place
in a newspaper office. Principal
characters are the editor-in-chief
and his departmental heads.
