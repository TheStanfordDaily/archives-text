# WOMEN FORECAST JOYS, DISTRESSES FOR BIG GAME
## 
### 
What does the Big Game mean to |
j the women? What's their slant on j
! that gala day? Some of the men say,
"Oh, they are interested in clothes,
whom they might see at the game,
and whom they have dates with Big
! Game night."
Thai might bo part of it, but give
the girls a chance to speak for them
selves. Here are some actual state
j ments.
"Big' Game is the peak of the
I whole quarter. It's all the football
games tied into one; and Big Game
night is all the date nights tied
into one."
"Big Game is the most thrilling
game of the season, no matter what
the odds," one senior girl points out.
Belles Blase
Of course, some of the girls are j
j more blase—
"Just another week-end shot. No
| work done. That's what Big Game
means to me," one junior girl flip
pantly remarks.
"Just a lot of grief," sighs a popu
lar brown-eyed damsel. "Where am
I going to change clothes? I'm go
ing right up to the city from the
game."
Some girls did mention late leave !
privileges: "Imagine coming in when j

the birdies start to sing—or do the
birdies start to sing at 3:30?"
"I have a date with a Cal fel
low. Think how I can razz him!"
That explains one viewpoint.
"Big Game offers a swell reason to
celebrate," explains another.
Clothes Less Important
The girls do mention clothes, but
mostly as a minor matter. More im
portant than clothes is the traffic
situation: "Driving will be hazard
ous, and finding a parking place is a
true problem."
The most Big Game enthusiasm
seems to be found among freshmen
women. What does Big Game mean
to them? It means excitement, card
stunts, noise, atmosphere — "being
part of something you've seen in the
movies." That's the general attitude
of many of them.
"Four forty! That's what it
means to me," groans one disillu
sioned freshman. "I didn't get my
rooter's ticket in time."
From a not so disillusioned and
very serious-eyed freshman comes
this statement: "Big Game is more
than a football game. It's a Stanford
tradition. And to me Saturday's
game means becoming part of that
tradition."

whom they might see at the game,
and whom they have dates with Big
! Game night."
Thai might bo part of it, but give
the girls a chance to speak for them
selves. Here are some actual state
j ments.
"Big' Game is the peak of the
I whole quarter. It's all the football
games tied into one; and Big Game
night is all the date nights tied
into one."
"Big Game is the most thrilling
game of the season, no matter what
the odds," one senior girl points out.
Belles Blase
Of course, some of the girls are j
j more blase—
"Just another week-end shot. No
| work done. That's what Big Game
means to me," one junior girl flip
pantly remarks.
"Just a lot of grief," sighs a popu
lar brown-eyed damsel. "Where am
I going to change clothes? I'm go
ing right up to the city from the
game."
Some girls did mention late leave !
privileges: "Imagine coming in when j

the birdies start to sing—or do the
birdies start to sing at 3:30?"
"I have a date with a Cal fel
low. Think how I can razz him!"
That explains one viewpoint.
"Big Game offers a swell reason to
celebrate," explains another.
Clothes Less Important
The girls do mention clothes, but
mostly as a minor matter. More im
portant than clothes is the traffic
situation: "Driving will be hazard
ous, and finding a parking place is a
true problem."
The most Big Game enthusiasm
seems to be found among freshmen
women. What does Big Game mean
to them? It means excitement, card
stunts, noise, atmosphere — "being
part of something you've seen in the
movies." That's the general attitude
of many of them.
"Four forty! That's what it
means to me," groans one disillu
sioned freshman. "I didn't get my
rooter's ticket in time."
From a not so disillusioned and
very serious-eyed freshman comes
this statement: "Big Game is more
than a football game. It's a Stanford
tradition. And to me Saturday's
game means becoming part of that
tradition."
What does the Big Game mean to |
j the women? What's their slant on j
! that gala day? Some of the men say,
"Oh, they are interested in clothes,
whom they might see at the game,
and whom they have dates with Big
! Game night."
