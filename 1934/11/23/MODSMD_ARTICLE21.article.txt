# INDIANS AWAIT BEAR HUNT
## Odds 4-1 On Cardinals; Thornhill Victory Means Certain Rose Bowl Bid Traditional Rivals in Shape For 40th Classic Clash; 70,000 Witnesses ARLEIGH WILLIAMS O.K. Grayson, Van Dellen Set To Start in Backfield 
### Millard Browne 
i It's Stanford's Indians in their 40th
1 annual classic combat with the
Golden Bears of the University of
California tomorrow afternoon.
It's a powerful, smooth, clever
group of Cardinals, heading for a
: national gridiron championship, that
will meet a potentially great but
actually disappointing, sometimes
j strong but several times defeated,
pack of Bears in California Memo
rial Stadium.
Odds 1 to 4
It's a heavily favored Redskin
eleven that invades Berkeley to-
I morrow afternoon in its final confer*
j ence test of 1934, ready to add the

Unless last - minute changes
are made the Stanford and
California football teams will
line up in the following man
ner tomorrow:
Stanford Pos. California
Moscrip LE B.Brittingham
Reynolds LT Anderson
Adams LG Beedy
Muller C Calkins
Rouble RG Drnovich
Callaway RT Nordstrom

Van Dellen LH (c) Williams
Hamilton (c) RH Moellcr
Grayson F Cotton

mortal blow to the already wounded
but still ferocious Bear, named 1 to
4 long shots to survive the Indians'
Big Game hunt.
But it's the Big Game, and some
70,000 human beings would he
there, cheering madly, if the odds
were 100 to 1.
And that means Stanford and
California football teams will both
be playing over their heads, strug
gling for sixty full minutes, in the
most colorful performance on the
Pacific slope.
It will be the second Big Game
for jovial Claude E. "Tiny" Thorn
hill as head coach of the Stanford
Indians, and it will be William A.
"Navy Bill" Ingram's fourth venture
into the classic of the West.
It will be the last game for only
one of Ihe Stanford starters, and it
will draw down the collegiate cur
tain on the gridiron careers of five
of the eleven Golden Bears.
Stanford will be "right" both
mentally and physically; Califor
nia will also he in good shape, un
less Arleigh Williams, Bear cap
tain, docs not recover from a slight
cold that laid him up during mid
week practice.
If there is any psychological ad
vantage, it will undoubtedly go to
California, inasmuch as Thornhill's
men are overwhelmingly chosen to
win.
Cards Confident
However, the Stanford team's at
titude is one of healthy sell-con
fidenco, and the Indians have given
no indication of over-confidcnce. It
is more than a Big Game to them.
It is a chance to prove themselves
the greatest team in Pacific Coast
pigskin history, and they will ex
tend every effort to demonstrate
| their claims to fame.
Victory for Stanford would
mean:
1. A virtual cinch for the Rose
Bowl bid. which will be tendered
I this week and following a tele- ;
i graphic voting of Pacific Coast
' Conference officials tomorrow ,
i night. fc i
2. Completion of the most suc
| cessful Cardinal season since 1
Stanford has yet to lose a game
this year.
A first place, or at least a tie
for first, in the Coast conference
race.
Record Feeble
The Bears have everything to gain
by a surprise victory over the highly
rated Stanfords. Their record is
somewhat feeble appearing as it now j
stands, yet a Big Game win would j
put them in a possible first place I
conference deadlock, since they have !
lost but one league game.
In spite of the wolfish talk of a j
poor California season, a Big Garnet
victory would give the Ingram men j
their first clean sweep of Stanford ;
and U.S.C. games since the Wonder |
Team days.
Taking up the argument ncga- j
lively, a Joss by more than a
touchdown or two almost certainly
would set the C.C. alumni to their
rampant raving once again, and
Navy Bill would find his 1935 con
tract, which is already signed, in j
a precarious position.
So the Blue and Gold clad indi
viduals from across the Bay have a
few little incentives that may in
veigle them into playing football j
over their heads.
«
To Play Overhead
Not only will both teams play j
over their heads, but they probably j
will show some overhead playing. '
Passes, lots of 'em, may or may not J
be on the program, but it is believed
lhat Stanford will pass all during the i
game in the attempt to prove they :
actually have a passing offensive, 1
and that the Californians will coun
ter with passes of their own. If for I
no other reason, the Bears will pass I
in the late stages because they have !

! to, assuming of course that present
* 4 to 1 ratings have any foundation,
i Each team finished active practice
j la s t night and the two will taper oil
! with light, sweat-suit work today.
Thornhill will not ' hide out" with
i his team this year as has been the
past custom, and the Indians will
leave the farm tomorrow morning
! at 11:15 o'clock, according to pres
ent plans.
Grayson in Condition
Bobby Grayson, Stanford's claim
to all-American distinction in the
fullback role, will be in perfect
physical shape for the game. He sat
| on the sidelines with a slight ab
( dominal injury while the Indians
tuned up with the Olympic Club last
i week, but the bruise is entirely well.
[ The Portland Boomer will call
plays from his fullback post.
Bones Hamilton, flashy blocker,
has been named acting captain of
( the Indian battalion and will open
together with Buck Van Dellen or
Bob Maenlz at the Stanford half
backs.

Van Dcllen probably will get the I
call for left half, with Maentz i
working during much of the game, j
Frankie Alustira will do the cjuar- I
tcrbacking.
Line-up Normal
The regular Stanford' line, to- i
gether for the first time since the j
U.S.C. game, will open, unless i
Thornhill changes his plans at the
last minute. Monk Moserip, the :
other chief Indian all-American can- '
didate, will team with Keith Top- !
ping in working Ihe ends; Bob Rey- I
no Ids and Claude Callaway, the \
tackles that opened in last year's j
California game, will start again, and |
Woody Adams and Larry Rouble,
"live and ten" guards, will be in the !
geme, with Wes Muller playing 1
center.

mortal blow to the already wounded
but still ferocious Bear, named 1 to
4 long shots to survive the Indians'
Big Game hunt.
But it's the Big Game, and some
70,000 human beings would he
there, cheering madly, if the odds
were 100 to 1.
And that means Stanford and
California football teams will both
be playing over their heads, strug
gling for sixty full minutes, in the
most colorful performance on the
Pacific slope.
It will be the second Big Game
for jovial Claude E. "Tiny" Thorn
hill as head coach of the Stanford
Indians, and it will be William A.
"Navy Bill" Ingram's fourth venture
into the classic of the West.
It will be the last game for only
one of Ihe Stanford starters, and it
will draw down the collegiate cur
tain on the gridiron careers of five
of the eleven Golden Bears.
Stanford will be "right" both
mentally and physically; Califor
nia will also he in good shape, un
less Arleigh Williams, Bear cap
tain, docs not recover from a slight
cold that laid him up during mid
week practice.
If there is any psychological ad
vantage, it will undoubtedly go to
California, inasmuch as Thornhill's
men are overwhelmingly chosen to
win.
Cards Confident
However, the Stanford team's at
titude is one of healthy sell-con
fidenco, and the Indians have given
no indication of over-confidcnce. It
is more than a Big Game to them.
It is a chance to prove themselves
the greatest team in Pacific Coast
pigskin history, and they will ex
tend every effort to demonstrate
| their claims to fame.
Victory for Stanford would
mean:
1. A virtual cinch for the Rose
Bowl bid. which will be tendered
I this week and following a tele- ;
i graphic voting of Pacific Coast
' Conference officials tomorrow ,
i night. fc i
2. Completion of the most suc
| cessful Cardinal season since 1
Stanford has yet to lose a game
this year.
A first place, or at least a tie
for first, in the Coast conference
race.
Record Feeble
The Bears have everything to gain
by a surprise victory over the highly
rated Stanfords. Their record is
somewhat feeble appearing as it now j
stands, yet a Big Game win would j
put them in a possible first place I
conference deadlock, since they have !
lost but one league game.
In spite of the wolfish talk of a j
poor California season, a Big Garnet
victory would give the Ingram men j
their first clean sweep of Stanford ;
and U.S.C. games since the Wonder |
Team days.
Taking up the argument ncga- j
lively, a Joss by more than a
touchdown or two almost certainly
would set the C.C. alumni to their
rampant raving once again, and
Navy Bill would find his 1935 con
tract, which is already signed, in j
a precarious position.

stands, yet a Big Game win would j
put them in a possible first place I
conference deadlock, since they have !
lost but one league game.
In spite of the wolfish talk of a j

victory would give the Ingram men j
their first clean sweep of Stanford ;
and U.S.C. games since the Wonder |
Team days.

«
To Play Overhead
Not only will both teams play j
over their heads, but they probably j
will show some overhead playing. '
Passes, lots of 'em, may or may not J
be on the program, but it is believed
lhat Stanford will pass all during the i
game in the attempt to prove they :
actually have a passing offensive, 1
and that the Californians will coun
ter with passes of their own. If for I
no other reason, the Bears will pass I
in the late stages because they have !

! to, assuming of course that present
* 4 to 1 ratings have any foundation,
i Each team finished active practice
j la s t night and the two will taper oil

Thornhill will not ' hide out" with
i his team this year as has been the
past custom, and the Indians will
leave the farm tomorrow morning
! at 11:15 o'clock, according to pres
ent plans.
Grayson in Condition
Bobby Grayson, Stanford's claim
to all-American distinction in the
fullback role, will be in perfect
physical shape for the game. He sat
| on the sidelines with a slight ab
( dominal injury while the Indians
tuned up with the Olympic Club last
i week, but the bruise is entirely well.
[ The Portland Boomer will call
plays from his fullback post.
Bones Hamilton, flashy blocker,
has been named acting captain of
( the Indian battalion and will open
together with Buck Van Dellen or
Bob Maenlz at the Stanford half
backs.

Van Dcllen probably will get the I
call for left half, with Maentz i
working during much of the game, j
Frankie Alustira will do the cjuar- I
tcrbacking.
Line-up Normal
The regular Stanford' line, to- i
gether for the first time since the j
U.S.C. game, will open, unless i
Thornhill changes his plans at the
last minute. Monk Moserip, the :
other chief Indian all-American can- '
didate, will team with Keith Top- !
ping in working Ihe ends; Bob Rey- I
no Ids and Claude Callaway, the \
tackles that opened in last year's j
California game, will start again, and |
Woody Adams and Larry Rouble,
"live and ten" guards, will be in the !
geme, with Wes Muller playing 1
center.
i It's Stanford's Indians in their 40th
1 annual classic combat with the
Golden Bears of the University of

mortal blow to the already wounded
but still ferocious Bear, named 1 to
4 long shots to survive the Indians'
Big Game hunt.
But it's the Big Game, and some
70,000 human beings would he
there, cheering madly, if the odds
were 100 to 1.
And that means Stanford and
California football teams will both
be playing over their heads, strug
gling for sixty full minutes, in the
most colorful performance on the
Pacific slope.
It will be the second Big Game
for jovial Claude E. "Tiny" Thorn
hill as head coach of the Stanford
Indians, and it will be William A.
"Navy Bill" Ingram's fourth venture
into the classic of the West.
It will be the last game for only
one of Ihe Stanford starters, and it
will draw down the collegiate cur
tain on the gridiron careers of five
of the eleven Golden Bears.
Stanford will be "right" both
mentally and physically; Califor
nia will also he in good shape, un
less Arleigh Williams, Bear cap
tain, docs not recover from a slight
cold that laid him up during mid
week practice.
If there is any psychological ad
vantage, it will undoubtedly go to
California, inasmuch as Thornhill's
men are overwhelmingly chosen to
win.
Cards Confident
However, the Stanford team's at
titude is one of healthy sell-con
fidenco, and the Indians have given
no indication of over-confidcnce. It
is more than a Big Game to them.
It is a chance to prove themselves
the greatest team in Pacific Coast
pigskin history, and they will ex
tend every effort to demonstrate
| their claims to fame.
Victory for Stanford would
mean:
1. A virtual cinch for the Rose

' Conference officials tomorrow ,

will draw down the collegiate cur
tain on the gridiron careers of five
of the eleven Golden Bears.
Stanford will be "right" both
mentally and physically; Califor
nia will also he in good shape, un
less Arleigh Williams, Bear cap
tain, docs not recover from a slight
cold that laid him up during mid
week practice.
If there is any psychological ad
vantage, it will undoubtedly go to
California, inasmuch as Thornhill's
men are overwhelmingly chosen to
win.
Cards Confident
However, the Stanford team's at
titude is one of healthy sell-con
fidenco, and the Indians have given
no indication of over-confidcnce. It
is more than a Big Game to them.
It is a chance to prove themselves
the greatest team in Pacific Coast
pigskin history, and they will ex
tend every effort to demonstrate
| their claims to fame.
Victory for Stanford would
mean:
1. A virtual cinch for the Rose
Bowl bid. which will be tendered
I this week and following a tele- ;
i graphic voting of Pacific Coast
' Conference officials tomorrow ,
i night. fc i
2. Completion of the most suc
| cessful Cardinal season since 1
Stanford has yet to lose a game
this year.
A first place, or at least a tie
for first, in the Coast conference
race.
Record Feeble
The Bears have everything to gain
by a surprise victory over the highly
rated Stanfords. Their record is
somewhat feeble appearing as it now j
stands, yet a Big Game win would j
put them in a possible first place I
conference deadlock, since they have !
lost but one league game.
In spite of the wolfish talk of a j
poor California season, a Big Garnet
victory would give the Ingram men j
their first clean sweep of Stanford ;
and U.S.C. games since the Wonder |
Team days.
Taking up the argument ncga- j
lively, a Joss by more than a
touchdown or two almost certainly
would set the C.C. alumni to their
rampant raving once again, and
Navy Bill would find his 1935 con
tract, which is already signed, in j
a precarious position.
So the Blue and Gold clad indi
viduals from across the Bay have a
few little incentives that may in
veigle them into playing football j
over their heads.
«
To Play Overhead
Not only will both teams play j
over their heads, but they probably j
will show some overhead playing. '
Passes, lots of 'em, may or may not J
be on the program, but it is believed
lhat Stanford will pass all during the i
game in the attempt to prove they :
actually have a passing offensive, 1
and that the Californians will coun
ter with passes of their own. If for I
no other reason, the Bears will pass I
in the late stages because they have !

! to, assuming of course that present
* 4 to 1 ratings have any foundation,
i Each team finished active practice
j la s t night and the two will taper oil
! with light, sweat-suit work today.
Thornhill will not ' hide out" with
i his team this year as has been the
past custom, and the Indians will
leave the farm tomorrow morning
! at 11:15 o'clock, according to pres
ent plans.
Grayson in Condition
Bobby Grayson, Stanford's claim
to all-American distinction in the
fullback role, will be in perfect
physical shape for the game. He sat
| on the sidelines with a slight ab
( dominal injury while the Indians
tuned up with the Olympic Club last
i week, but the bruise is entirely well.
[ The Portland Boomer will call
plays from his fullback post.
Bones Hamilton, flashy blocker,
has been named acting captain of
( the Indian battalion and will open
together with Buck Van Dellen or
Bob Maenlz at the Stanford half
backs.

Van Dcllen probably will get the I
call for left half, with Maentz i
working during much of the game, j
Frankie Alustira will do the cjuar- I
tcrbacking.
Line-up Normal
The regular Stanford' line, to- i
gether for the first time since the j
U.S.C. game, will open, unless i
Thornhill changes his plans at the
last minute. Monk Moserip, the :
other chief Indian all-American can- '
didate, will team with Keith Top- !
ping in working Ihe ends; Bob Rey- I
no Ids and Claude Callaway, the \
tackles that opened in last year's j
California game, will start again, and |
Woody Adams and Larry Rouble,
"live and ten" guards, will be in the !
geme, with Wes Muller playing 1
center.
