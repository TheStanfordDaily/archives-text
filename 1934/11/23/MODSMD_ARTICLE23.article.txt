# Standard Athletic Salaries? Old Boy, We Do Disagree
## 
### 
Many schemes have been propounded in the
hope thai something might he done to alleviate
the admittedly unfortunate situation that per
mits sham and hypocrisy to bring forth
charges of "proselyting" in one form or
another every year against some institution.
this is Big (lame Week, and tomorrow
.SO,0(1(1 roaring fans will see nothing less than
the fortieth annual Big Game. At the very
height of the 1934 football season, when all
of us are close to the game, we consider the
following:
Daily Calif ornian Editor Walter Christie Jr.
says that all varsity athletes should be taken
care of duriiuj periods of training through the
media of regular athletic dormitories and
training tables. A good proposition, and there
is much to be said for it.
Yesterday, the Old Boy stopped tickling his
funny hone long enough to release the out
standing Big (lame Chaparral of recent years,
;iikl the Old Dodderer actually was serious
enough to include a critical examination of
the athletic setup, with comments and sug
gestions.
He advocates outright pay, on a straight
hourly basis equivalent to the regular I'niver
silv rates, for all varsity men during the period
of training. He would do away with athletic
scholarships, leaving all such awards open
only to individuals who attain scholastic
achievement.
The Daily having initiated all this talk
about reaching a Conference agreement that
might tend to ease the difficulties, if not elimi
nate them, agrees with everybody else that
something ought to be done. The more con
servative professrial members of the Pacific
Coast Conference might forget what the die
hards may think about any action in this
direction, and get down to realities as faced
by the students themselves.
The Chaparral, in our opinion, is wrong.
Football does not have to be placed on an
hourly, sordid, cold cash basis. Nor do un
limited scholarships necessarily have to he
granted all athletes. But, inasmuch as that
activity yields an annual income that runs
into six figures, it is not impossible to con
ceive of room and board provided for by each
institution for its varsity athletes during the
training periods.
Action in this direction, at the next Confer
ence meeting, alone will prove this contention.
