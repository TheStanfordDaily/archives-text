in which students, the ultimate leaders of to- !
morrow, were prevented from showing an
active interest in securing an adequate knowl

Truth, the professed goal of all academic i
endeavor, is all too often sealed out of the
cloistered seclusion of I lie college environ- I
menl because it might tend to make students
question some of the iderils that prevail in
Ibis world of ours.
Change and progress, not only technical
bul in ways of thinking, is essential to our j

cated and more hopeless. The wonder is that

ance in the universities as we do.
The older generation always has been a
