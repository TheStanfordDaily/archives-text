# What A Game, What A Week-End
## 
### 
Tomorrow is the day of days; the culmina
tion, for Stanford, of a perfect football season;
the opportunity, for California, of achieving
a perfect season in one devastating stroke.
The football eyes of the nation will focus
(in California Memorial Stadium where some
seventy-odd thousand fans will gather to
pay service at the alter of the gridiron.
Truly, it is King Football's day.
The shades of gridiron greats will look on
from the sidelines. "Hriek" Midler, Ernie
Nevers, Murray Cuddeback, Babe Horrell, Dick
Hvland, Irv Phillips, will be there iu spirit if
not iu body to sec that the warriors fit to
morrow keep the standards set by them, the
veterans of yesterday.
Let the play he hard and fierce and clean,
of superlative beauty for the eonoisseur's en
joyment. Let it be swift and thrilling, delect
able to the most untutored lady fan.
Let the best men win.
Let the rooting sections adhere to the
criterion of sportsmanship set by the teams.
Hemeinber, we are Stanford men and women,
and they are Californians, worthy of our metal.
And let the Stanford rooting section re
frain from molesting the goalposts. Nothing
short of blowtorches and dynamite will root
them up.
Next year, tin our home field, Stanford will
furnish real honest-to-(iod wooden posts, and
if those California goons are men enough to
win the game, they'll be welcome to tear them
stick from stick and splinter from splinter.
Heallv, Cal, it shows a distressing lack of
confidence in that football team, when you
have to guard the posts with steel and con
crete, not men.
