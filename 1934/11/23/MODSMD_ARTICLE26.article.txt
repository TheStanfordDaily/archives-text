# Reorganization Needed
## 
### 
There seems to be a superabundance of lost
and found bureaus around the campus, which
cause no end of difficulty when the absent
minded student goes afield in search of his
mislaid belongings.
Once upon a time, the lost and found de
partment was in the Administration Building
and the seeker could feel reasonably sure he
had covered the field after a visit there. Now,
the Ad building maintains nothing more than
one of the branches. The 8.A.C., the Library,
and the Union all support their little indi
vidual box of miscellany under the name of
lost and found bureaus.
It would save the secretary's nerves, the
losers' patience, and would be much simpler
for all concerned, if some centralization of
this service could be effected.
