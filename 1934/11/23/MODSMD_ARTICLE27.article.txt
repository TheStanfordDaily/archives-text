"Roosevelt Orders U.S. Delegates To Make no Com
promise on Navy with Japan."
This headline yesterday made it plain to the people
of the nation that the President will stand for no
attempts at duping on the part of those nations repre
sented at the London naval parley now in progress.
Roosevelt realizes the present 5-5-3 ratio is best suited
to United States interests and has no intention of
letting the English or the Japanese talk the Yankee
representatives out of their convictions.
Ellery C. Stowell, acting professor of political
science, views the present naval and armament
questions in much the same light as the President.
He feels that the country is fortunate in having a
man thoroughly trained in naval affairs at the
head of our government—a man who is strong for
disarmament and peace but who will not let the
United States become duped by such wily poli
ticians as often have a part in disarmament parleys.
Professor Stowell feels strongly about certain ele
ments which have found their way into the present
London meeting. Of Foreign Minister John Simon
of England he says:
"I consider Sir John Simon to be one of the
most unscrupulous and tricky men ever to be at
the head of the foreign office of a great civilized
power. The failure to co-operate more closely in
armament relations has been in part our own fault,
but the selfish, narrow policy of Simon makes it
difficult to secure any restriction of armaments
and to put a curb on the pretensions of Japan.
"When the next change comes in Great Britain's
government we can expect more close co-operation
between that country and ours."
After considering the latest developments at Lon
don, Professor Stowell sums up the international arma
ments' situation:
"The good faith of the United States in desiring
to curb armaments has been demonstrated throughout
all the negotiations. A good example of this spirit was
evidenced when it destroyed certain warships which
it was building and when it signed the nine-power
pact.
"Japan has conspicuously violated the nine
power pact, as is obvious to any fair-minded per
son. And since the respect for treaties is the basis
of international security, her action has caused a
sense of insecurity among the various nations and
aroused in tliein a desire for further defense arma
ments.
"If we allow Japan to increase armaments above
the present ratio we may as well withdraw attempts
to exert our influence in the Far East and to maintain
the open door policy in China. Such withdrawal of
policy might prove to be best, but until we do so we
cannot agree to any important modifications of ratio.
We cannot give up the right to build large cruisers
which can act effectively in the Far East, as Great
Britain and Japan are obviously anxious to have us do."
Professor Stowell feels that satisfactory results sel
dom come from naval parleys, but in a spirit of op
timism he states: "I haven't yet given up all hope for
some satisfactory result in thf London parley."

He feels that the country is fortunate in having a
man thoroughly trained in naval affairs at the
head of our government—a man who is strong for
disarmament and peace but who will not let the
United States become duped by such wily poli
ticians as often have a part in disarmament parleys.
Professor Stowell feels strongly about certain ele
ments which have found their way into the present
London meeting. Of Foreign Minister John Simon
of England he says:
"I consider Sir John Simon to be one of the
most unscrupulous and tricky men ever to be at
the head of the foreign office of a great civilized
power. The failure to co-operate more closely in
armament relations has been in part our own fault,
but the selfish, narrow policy of Simon makes it
difficult to secure any restriction of armaments
and to put a curb on the pretensions of Japan.
"When the next change comes in Great Britain's
government we can expect more close co-operation
between that country and ours."
After considering the latest developments at Lon
don, Professor Stowell sums up the international arma
ments' situation:
"The good faith of the United States in desiring
to curb armaments has been demonstrated throughout
all the negotiations. A good example of this spirit was
evidenced when it destroyed certain warships which
it was building and when it signed the nine-power
pact.
"Japan has conspicuously violated the nine
power pact, as is obvious to any fair-minded per
son. And since the respect for treaties is the basis
of international security, her action has caused a
sense of insecurity among the various nations and
aroused in tliein a desire for further defense arma
ments.
"If we allow Japan to increase armaments above
the present ratio we may as well withdraw attempts
to exert our influence in the Far East and to maintain
the open door policy in China. Such withdrawal of
policy might prove to be best, but until we do so we
cannot agree to any important modifications of ratio.
We cannot give up the right to build large cruisers
which can act effectively in the Far East, as Great
Britain and Japan are obviously anxious to have us do."
Professor Stowell feels that satisfactory results sel
dom come from naval parleys, but in a spirit of op
timism he states: "I haven't yet given up all hope for
some satisfactory result in thf London parley."
WITH ELLERY C. STOWELL

"Roosevelt Orders U.S. Delegates To Make no Com
promise on Navy with Japan."
This headline yesterday made it plain to the people
of the nation that the President will stand for no
attempts at duping on the part of those nations repre
sented at the London naval parley now in progress.
Roosevelt realizes the present 5-5-3 ratio is best suited
to United States interests and has no intention of
letting the English or the Japanese talk the Yankee
representatives out of their convictions.
Ellery C. Stowell, acting professor of political
science, views the present naval and armament
questions in much the same light as the President.
