810 GAME WEEK-END

starts tonight. Be
tween the drafts and bats of the As
sembly Hall, the Gaieties of 1934
will hold the stage. Everyone goes
to the Gaieties, even those who don't
get comps. For the Gaieties are al
ways "good." That is to say, they are
always "better"—than nine out of
ten other campus dramatic produc
tions, and nine out of ten Hollywood
movies. And as long as there are
roughs in the gallery, and people as
crazy as the Horrible Goon and
Copp, the Gurgler, the Gaieties can
not fail.
Saturday, everyone goes to Berke
ley—even if they don't like football.
This year Stanford must be very
cagy on the campus across the Bay.
For an uneasy tension lies beyond
Sather Gate. Cal had a "red scare,"

| and never got over it. It is not safe
i to talk too loudly about Joe Doke, oi'
' the CLASS of '35, or about the
STRUGGLE in the stadium, or
about the big RED machine. All
I that may be collegiate, but to
the scarers and scarees at Berkeley
it sounds suspiciously like K. Marx,
N. Lenin, J. Stalin, and the other
boys of the U.S.S.R. The "red" peril
is added to the normal parking and
goal post hazards of the Big Game.
Saturday night, after Stanford has
won the game, everyone goes to the
city. People crowd each other into
hotels; fight for breaths of fresh air
in between drinks; poke each other
in the ribs; kick each other in the
j shins and other places; try franti
cally to get the attention of a waiter
who is trying frantically to spot the
sugar-daddies; whisper sweet some
things into the ear of the other
man's partner; scream hoarsely for
the orchestra to play "Come Join
the Band" which it has already
' played a dozen times: dip deep into
wallets; race home against lock-outs
i and Morpheus; roll into bed; wake
up the next morning with horrible
hangovers; and run out to tell their
cronies and sister-gossips what won
-1 derful times they had on Big Game
Nights. My, what fun!
Thus comes Big Game Week-end.
Protests are futile. Everyone suc
cumbs, and prays that it will not
j rain on New Year's.

810 GAME WEEK-END

starts tonight. Be
tween the drafts and bats of the As
sembly Hall, the Gaieties of 1934
will hold the stage. Everyone goes
to the Gaieties, even those who don't
get comps. For the Gaieties are al
ways "good." That is to say, they are
always "better"—than nine out of
ten other campus dramatic produc
tions, and nine out of ten Hollywood
movies. And as long as there are
roughs in the gallery, and people as
crazy as the Horrible Goon and
Copp, the Gurgler, the Gaieties can
not fail.
Saturday, everyone goes to Berke
ley—even if they don't like football.
This year Stanford must be very
cagy on the campus across the Bay.
For an uneasy tension lies beyond
Sather Gate. Cal had a "red scare,"

| and never got over it. It is not safe
i to talk too loudly about Joe Doke, oi'
' the CLASS of '35, or about the
STRUGGLE in the stadium, or
about the big RED machine. All
I that may be collegiate, but to
the scarers and scarees at Berkeley
it sounds suspiciously like K. Marx,
N. Lenin, J. Stalin, and the other
boys of the U.S.S.R. The "red" peril
is added to the normal parking and
goal post hazards of the Big Game.
Saturday night, after Stanford has
won the game, everyone goes to the
city. People crowd each other into
hotels; fight for breaths of fresh air
in between drinks; poke each other
in the ribs; kick each other in the
j shins and other places; try franti
cally to get the attention of a waiter
who is trying frantically to spot the
sugar-daddies; whisper sweet some
things into the ear of the other
man's partner; scream hoarsely for
the orchestra to play "Come Join
the Band" which it has already
' played a dozen times: dip deep into
wallets; race home against lock-outs
i and Morpheus; roll into bed; wake
up the next morning with horrible
hangovers; and run out to tell their
cronies and sister-gossips what won
-1 derful times they had on Big Game
Nights. My, what fun!
