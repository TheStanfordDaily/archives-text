SWEETS FOR SWEETIES
The Editor, Sir:
Speaking of dying traditions, what
has happened to the good old custom
of the considerate escort's sending
his fair damsel a box of candy when
failing to get her in at the appointed
hour? As he is often responsible for
her late arrival, the chivalrous Stan
ford gentleman should be willing to
take upon his manly shoulders his
share of the blame.
Luscious creams and sticky cara
mels are such sympathetic compan
ions to divert her troubled thoughts
from her lonely state on the night of
penance. A pound of candy for
every minute overtime up to five
would undoubtedly bring a large
decrease in the number of lockouts.
How about it, fellows?
