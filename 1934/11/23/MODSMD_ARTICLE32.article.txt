"SERVANTS' ENTRANCE"
At Varsity Theatre
Admirers of Janet Gaynor will
enjoy this entertainment. Janet
gives an ingratiating performance as

a Swedish mil
lionaire's daugh
ter who is forced
by circumstances
to become a ser
vant. Personable
Lew Ayres, her
"State Fair" at
traction, is the

chauffeur-inventor whom she mar
ries.
Frank Lloyd's direction makes a
delightful fantasy of a thoroughly
unbelievable story. The romantic
and imaginative effects he achieves
are intensified by a beautiful musi
cal score. The camera seems in
spired in its striking outdoor pho
tography, even when the Swedish
countryside appears suspiciously
similar to California scenes near
Pebble Beach.
•KANSAS CITY PJtINCESS"
Also at the Varsity Theatre
Warners' should have shelved this
film. It is little more than a series
of crude situations, completely de-

void of humor.
The well - worn
"gold - diggers"
theme, again
utilized, is de
prived of what
ever zest it still
might possess by
the expurgato-

rial demands of the League of De
cency. Joan Blondell and Glenda
Farrell appear as two brassy barber
shop employees, and Hugh Herbert
is the millionaire who befriends
them in Paris.
