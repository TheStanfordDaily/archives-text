### 
An exhibition match between
Lawson Little, Bobby Jones, Stew
Hawley, and Ernie Pieper is the bill
scheduled by the San Francisco Jun
ior League for the golfing fans of the
Bay region at the San Francisce
Country Club Sunday afternoon at
2 o'clock.
Of special interest to Stanford is
the fact that the match will have the
Farm's two outstanding golf prod
ucts, Stew Hawley, who galloped
away with the California State Golf
Championship at Pebble Beach this
summer, and Lawson Little, Wa'ker
Cup man and International golf

Jones Creates Match
The question of just how Little
compares with* Jones in golfing abil
ity may be answered during the
progress of the match, but whatever
kind of golf is played it is certain
that it will be a long lime before
the winner of the Grand Slarn of
golf meets one of the three Little
Slam winners.
Bobby Jones is the main reason
for the match. He has the distinction
of being the only man in the history
of golf to have both British and
American Open and Amateur cups
on his mantle at the same time. Both
of the amateur titles are in Little's
possession at the present time.
Lesser Golfers Rising
Ernie Pieper and Stew Hawley
both have the distinction of being
among the fast-rising satellites in
American golf. Pieper is known for
his advance to the quarter finals of
the National Amateur this year. Golf
teachers and critics consider his
swing one of the soundest in Ameri
can golf today.
Jones is by no means the golfer
he was at the time he won his titles.
Business that demands his attention
has rather taken some of (he agility
on the greens that long practice gave
him. He is also considerably heavier
than when he annexed the four
major titles. Little has been con
siderably hampered by academic
work and college distractions but is
sure to show some excellent golf.
