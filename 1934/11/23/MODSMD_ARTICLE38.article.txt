## 
### 
Designed especially for the largest |
i rooting section in Stanford history, 1
ten colorful card stunts which bid
fair to rival all former displays of !
half-time entertainment will be pre- j
I sented Saturday. Twenty-five' hun- i
dred students are expected to fill the J
i section.
Awards for prize drawings in the [
recent contest were given to four j
students. The Roos Brothers award j
j was divided between Fred Phipers i
| and Jack Kellogg. The "Poor Cal"
| stunt with a Bear and arrow won for |
Sue Ward the Zwierlein Walk-Over
Boot Shop prize. Gilman Gist won ,
the Rhodes Men's Shop prize with an
1 elaborately worked - out face of
j "Tiny" Thornhill.
The first stunt will be a big "S" |
with rooters' caps which will be 1
maintained throughout the game. '
During the half the section will be- !
j gin with a shifting picture of the '
| big "C" on a campanile background i
! changing to the Stanford "S" and a J
j pine tree in the background. Trib- I
ute will next be paid to Red Christie, j
j California captain, who will not play i
because of injuries received during
1 the season. This picture will be :

! followed by a caricature of Coach j
! "Tiny" Thornhili, which promises to |
be the most detailed stunt yet at- i
! tempted.
| The fourth stunt will be the well- j
known Indian swastika followed by j
! a large "S" and "C." Poor Cal will I
| be depicted by its traditional bear |
| with a Card arrow piercing him. An j
j ace of diamonds will name the i
i "Cards" and tv/o football players!
i tackling each other will form the j
: eighth picture.
i It is doubtful whether there will !
I be time for more stunts, but if there j
I is Stanford will be spelled diagonally !
, across the section with a picture of !
the axe in one corner. "Dink" Tem
i pleton and his 1.C.4-A. men will be
i honored by the final stunt. These j
pictures involve more detailed work ;
1 than attempted by a Stanford sec- ;
j tion in recent years. j

i rooting section in Stanford history, 1
ten colorful card stunts which bid
fair to rival all former displays of !
half-time entertainment will be pre- j
I sented Saturday. Twenty-five' hun- i
dred students are expected to fill the J
i section.
Awards for prize drawings in the [
recent contest were given to four j
students. The Roos Brothers award j
j was divided between Fred Phipers i
| and Jack Kellogg. The "Poor Cal"
| stunt with a Bear and arrow won for |
Sue Ward the Zwierlein Walk-Over
Boot Shop prize. Gilman Gist won ,
the Rhodes Men's Shop prize with an
1 elaborately worked - out face of
j "Tiny" Thornhill.
The first stunt will be a big "S" |
with rooters' caps which will be 1
maintained throughout the game. '
During the half the section will be- !
j gin with a shifting picture of the '
| big "C" on a campanile background i
! changing to the Stanford "S" and a J
j pine tree in the background. Trib- I
ute will next be paid to Red Christie, j
j California captain, who will not play i
because of injuries received during
1 the season. This picture will be :

! followed by a caricature of Coach j
! "Tiny" Thornhili, which promises to |
be the most detailed stunt yet at- i
! tempted.
| The fourth stunt will be the well- j
known Indian swastika followed by j
! a large "S" and "C." Poor Cal will I
| be depicted by its traditional bear |
| with a Card arrow piercing him. An j
j ace of diamonds will name the i
i "Cards" and tv/o football players!
i tackling each other will form the j
: eighth picture.
i It is doubtful whether there will !
I be time for more stunts, but if there j
I is Stanford will be spelled diagonally !
, across the section with a picture of !
the axe in one corner. "Dink" Tem
i pleton and his 1.C.4-A. men will be
i honored by the final stunt. These j
pictures involve more detailed work ;
1 than attempted by a Stanford sec- ;
j tion in recent years. j
