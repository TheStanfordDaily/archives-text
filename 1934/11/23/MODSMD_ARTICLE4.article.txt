# WILBUR ISSUES DRINK WARNING
## Plea Made for Sobriety And Good Conduct 
### 
Reminding students that drunken
ness or possession of liquor on the
campus is sufficient grounds for ex
pulsion, a plea for sobriety and sane
conduct in all activities concerned
with the Big Game is being made
today by University leaders.
New students and old are re
minded of the statement in the Reg
ister of the University which states:
"The University assumes that
the act of registering as a student
implies full acceptance of the
liquor policy of the University.
Row men and women are warned
of the clauses in the leases of fra
ternity and sorority houses: "It is
expressly covenanted, agreed, and
understood that no malt, spirituous,
or intoxicating liquors of whatever
kind shall ever be sold, kept, or used
in the demised premises, and upon
a violation of this covenant this
lease shall terminate and become
void."
In a recent letter of caution in re
gard to the Big Game, sent to the
presidents of all living groups, Presi
dent Wilbur stated:

Wilbur's Statement

"The football game with the Uni
versity of California is a source of
concern to those of us who value
Stanford's reputation. Members of
the student body participate in pub
lic social gatherings in San Fran
cisco and elsewhere which, in the
excitement and enthusiasm, are
likely to lead to serious acidents and
to acts, careless or deliberate, on
the part of students which affcct not
only the interests of the students but
also the good name of the University.
A word of caution is in order."
