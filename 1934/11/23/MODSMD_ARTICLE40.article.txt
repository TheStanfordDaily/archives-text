# TRAVEL PLEASURE OF GOLF REVEALED BY LAWSON LITTLE
## Star Golfer Tells of Stay In Southland During Walker Matches 
### John McClelland 
William Lawson Little, Walker
Cup star, British Amateur golf
champion, National Amateur golf
champion, and Pacific Coast Inter
collegiate golf champion, has come
to be rather well known as a golfer
during recent months. But as a trav
! eler, which he also is, he is not so
well known.
Back now at school with thoughts
of conquest pushed aside to make
room for the business of studying,
Lawson has revealed some of the
! interesting side lights of his travels
of the summer.
Appointment Told
Word of the Walker Cup appoint
ment came last January. After the
winter quarter was finished Lawson
went to New York to join the rest
of the men who were to defend the
I famed Walker Cup.
They sailed for Scotland on the
"Caledonia" on April 21 and made
a voyage that the captain of the
ship called "the quietest he had seen
in 25 years."
Plays St. Andrews
Many stories have been told about
Walker Cup teams driving brand
new balls into the ocean to keep in
trim during the ocean crossings.
Lawson reveals that the stories are
true but that the balls driven are
ones that have been X-rayed and
found imperfect, and so the practice
is not so extravagant as it seems.
Little and the other team members
drove 1700 balls overboard on the
trip.
Once in Scotland, the first thing
done, of course, was to play the ven
erable old St. Andrews course. Law
son expressed himself as full of
anticipation as he first set foot on
the old course, so much had he heard
about it. It was a hard course, he
said, but an enjoyable one and
rightly deserving of the respect
it now has in the world of golf.
Lawson shot a 78 on his first time
around.
Scotland was a country that ap
pealed to Little. He liked the people,
their quaint customs and especially
the old burry-tongued caddies,

Man Mountain Dean recently out
wrestled Nick Lutze after each had
won a fall, by virtue of Lutze not
being able to continue. Lutze
weighed 210 pounds and Dean 317.
