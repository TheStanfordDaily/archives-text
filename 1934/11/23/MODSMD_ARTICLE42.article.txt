# Indian Varsity Mermen Face Tough Season
## Frosh Prospects for Year Look Better to Coach 
### 
Stanford's swimming prospects for j
1935 are only mediocre for the var
sity, but good for the frosh, accord
ing to Coach Nort Thornton. After |
losing most of last year's stars, the |
Indians are rebuilding with a team
composed largely of sophomores and
.-junior college transfers, and will
probably have their weakest aqua
tic outfit in years.
Captain Bob Foster is the Indians' |
sole, natator of nationally known I
ability, holding the American record
for the 440-yard breast-stroke at
6 minutes, 5.7 seconds, set in Encina j
pool at the Stanford relays last '
April. The Card leader swam the i
200-yard breast-stroke consistently
in 2:38 last year, comparing favor
ably with the Coast record of 2:37 2,
and has a mark of 1:10 in the 100 to
his credit. John Harvey, transfer
from lowa State and capable of 2:40
in the 200 is another breast-stroke {
prospect.
Sprinters Practice
Alec MacKenzie, Don Petit, and i
Martin Scatena are the leading
sprinters at present. All have done
well in practice in the 50 and 100-
yard free style, but are unproved
in competition. Bob Sutherland, j
another water poloist, has made a
time of 24.8 in the 50.
Jack Kuhn, 100 and 220-yard man.
is the most promising of the Card i
free stylists, having sv/um the fur
long in 2:24. Bob Hoover, three
seconds slower in past performances,
will back up Kuhn in this race, Don
Peterson, who broke the Little Big ,
Meet 440 record by 30 seconds last
spring, and Bill Cle©io, Long Beach
transfer with a quarter-mile time of i
5:20, will swim the distances for the j
Indians.
Veterans Return
The leading candidate for the !
back-stroke at present is Holly ;
Fitting, 1934 veteran, who will re- j
ceive competition from Jack Berg- '
man and Dee Myers over the 150- '
yard route. Bill Rogers, who set the
California-Stanford freshman record
of 1:47 several years ago, may go out
for swimming in the coming season.
Milton Friedman, a senior, and
Tom Boothe, a junior, lead the divers
on the team, and George Fraser, a ;
veteran' of the 1932 versity, is re- |
turning to competition.
S.C. Favored
Stanford is tentatively scheduled
to meet U.S.C in dual competition,
and is doped to lose to the Trojans
for the first time in history. The
Cards have won every dual meet in
which they have competed since
1917. The 19.J5 schedule, which will
probably run from the second week
in Februai'y until April 13, includes
meets with California, U.C.L.A., San
Jose State, and the Lakeside Swim
ming Club, in addition to the Tro
jans.
With a much brighter outlook, the
Indian frosh team includes several
good prospects for the 1936 varsity.
Particularly strong in the breast
stroke and back-stroke events, the
Papooses will soon begin prepai'ation
for a season which will parallel that
of the varsity as to dates, and will
include meets with Golden Gate
Junior College, the Y.M.C.A. re
serves, and the San Jose State and
California yearlings.
Smith Is Frosh Star
Best known of the first - year
aquatic stars is Warren Smith, who
has to his crcdit a mark of 1:C9.7 in
the 100-yard breast-stroke. Smith
made this time, a record for high
schools, in the Stanford Swimming
Relays last spring. He also has swum
the 200 in 2:30, and the 220 in 2:57
in the frog-like stroke.

1917. The 19.J5 schedule, which will

With a much brighter outlook, the

Particularly strong in the breast
stroke and back-stroke events, the
Papooses will soon begin prepai'ation
for a season which will parallel that
of the varsity as to dates, and will
include meets with Golden Gate
Junior College, the Y.M.C.A. re

Smith Is Frosh Star
Best known of the first - year
aquatic stars is Warren Smith, who
has to his crcdit a mark of 1:C9.7 in
the 100-yard breast-stroke. Smith
made this time, a record for high
schools, in the Stanford Swimming
Relays last spring. He also has swum
the 200 in 2:30, and the 220 in 2:57
in the frog-like stroke.
The only man who defeated Smith j
Stanford's swimming prospects for j
1935 are only mediocre for the var
sity, but good for the frosh, accord
ing to Coach Nort Thornton. After |
losing most of last year's stars, the |
Indians are rebuilding with a team
composed largely of sophomores and
.-junior college transfers, and will
probably have their weakest aqua
tic outfit in years.
Captain Bob Foster is the Indians' |
sole, natator of nationally known I
ability, holding the American record
for the 440-yard breast-stroke at
6 minutes, 5.7 seconds, set in Encina j
pool at the Stanford relays last '
April. The Card leader swam the i
200-yard breast-stroke consistently
in 2:38 last year, comparing favor
ably with the Coast record of 2:37 2,
and has a mark of 1:10 in the 100 to
his credit. John Harvey, transfer

in the 200 is another breast-stroke {
prospect.

Jack Kuhn, 100 and 220-yard man.
is the most promising of the Card i
