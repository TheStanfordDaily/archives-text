# Stanford Due For Comeback In '36 Tennis
## Varsity Strengthened By Frosh, Transfers 
### 
Will Stanford tennis follow the
lead of Stanford football and rise to
prominence in the Coast Confer
ence? Until last year Stanford was
acknowledged the leader in college
tennis in the United States. During
an eleven-year period, starting in
1921, Keith Gledhill, Cranston Hol
man, and Phil Neer carried suc
cessfully the Stanford colors into the
arena of the Merion Club in Penn
sylvania.
The high-water mark of Stanford
tennis was reached in 1932, when
Sam Let, this year's tennis captain,
and Joe Coughlin, '33 captain, won
the Intercollegiate Doubles Cham
pionship. This victory gave Stanford
enough points to win the Inter
collegiate Tennis Cup, given to the
j school that had gained the most
victories in the Intercollegiate tour
nament since 1919.
Hard Luck Hits Team
Last year hard luck hit the team,
i Sam Lee was in an auto accident
| and could not compete the last
j half of the season. Glenn Reed
i number five man, decided to gradu
ate at the end of winter quarter and
1 became ineligible for competition.
Without sufficient strength in the
, lower brackets, and with S.C.'s
brilliant Gene Mako dominating the
i number one matches, Stanford lost
its high place in Coast Conference
I competition.
This year Stanford will have both
j number one strength and strength
in the lower brackets. It is doubt- i
ful if Sam Lee can take S.C.'s Mako, j
but S.C.'s Mako may forget about j
college competition and be train -
for Davis Cup competition next
I spring.
Varsity Competition Keen
i Bill Seward, John Law, Jack
Lynch, Bob Pommer, Ben Dey, Stan
Lordeaux, and Danny Clark have
been competing for the five other
places on the team. Most of these
men could defeat the number two ;
and three men of the other colleges !
in the conference. Probably Lynch.
Seward, Law, and Dey at the height
of their form could take most of the
| number one men.
This sudden increase in r-irength
is due to the exceptional ability of
last year's freshmen: Dey, Sewai'd,
and Pommer; and to the transfer
of two outstanding men: Lynch from
Taft Junior College, and Lordeaux
from Menlo.
Further strength for future varsi- j
ties is revealed in this year's fresh- j
man team. The triumvirate of Bobs:
Bob Underwood, Bob Braley, and
Bob Colwell, the three favorites in
; the Freshman tournament, have all
advanced to the fourth round.
Walter Ralphs, another talented
yearling, has kept pace with the
i nabobs.

and Pommer; and to the transfer
of two outstanding men: Lynch from
Taft Junior College, and Lordeaux
from Menlo.
Further strength for future varsi- j
ties is revealed in this year's fresh- j
man team. The triumvirate of Bobs:
Bob Underwood, Bob Braley, and
Bob Colwell, the three favorites in
; the Freshman tournament, have all
advanced to the fourth round.
Walter Ralphs, another talented
yearling, has kept pace with the
i nabobs.
Will Stanford tennis follow the
lead of Stanford football and rise to
prominence in the Coast Confer
ence? Until last year Stanford was
acknowledged the leader in college
tennis in the United States. During
an eleven-year period, starting in
1921, Keith Gledhill, Cranston Hol
man, and Phil Neer carried suc
cessfully the Stanford colors into the
arena of the Merion Club in Penn
sylvania.
The high-water mark of Stanford
tennis was reached in 1932, when
Sam Let, this year's tennis captain,
and Joe Coughlin, '33 captain, won
the Intercollegiate Doubles Cham
pionship. This victory gave Stanford
enough points to win the Inter
collegiate Tennis Cup, given to the
j school that had gained the most
victories in the Intercollegiate tour
nament since 1919.
Hard Luck Hits Team
Last year hard luck hit the team,
i Sam Lee was in an auto accident
| and could not compete the last
j half of the season. Glenn Reed
i number five man, decided to gradu
ate at the end of winter quarter and
1 became ineligible for competition.
Without sufficient strength in the
, lower brackets, and with S.C.'s
brilliant Gene Mako dominating the
i number one matches, Stanford lost
its high place in Coast Conference
I competition.
This year Stanford will have both
j number one strength and strength
in the lower brackets. It is doubt- i
ful if Sam Lee can take S.C.'s Mako, j
but S.C.'s Mako may forget about j
college competition and be train -
for Davis Cup competition next
I spring.
Varsity Competition Keen
i Bill Seward, John Law, Jack
Lynch, Bob Pommer, Ben Dey, Stan
Lordeaux, and Danny Clark have
been competing for the five other
places on the team. Most of these
men could defeat the number two ;
and three men of the other colleges !
in the conference. Probably Lynch.
Seward, Law, and Dey at the height
of their form could take most of the
| number one men.
This sudden increase in r-irength
is due to the exceptional ability of
last year's freshmen: Dey, Sewai'd,
and Pommer; and to the transfer
of two outstanding men: Lynch from
Taft Junior College, and Lordeaux
from Menlo.
