### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 22 (/Phâ€”
Joe Di Maggio, husky young out
fielder, sold yesterday to the New
York Yankees by the San Francisco
Seals, becomes major league prop
erty after two years of professional
baseball.
"Deadpan Joe," as he is known
throughout the Coast League, joined
the Seals for the last three games
of 1932 after his older brother, Vince,
had persuaded the club officials he
1 was a "good prospect for shortstop.'
