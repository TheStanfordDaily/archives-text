# '38 Gridsters Through After Five Victories
## Cal Cubs Only Conquerors; Paulman Stars 
### Warren Breed 
With an 84 per cent perfect season,
the 1938 frosh football varsity is no j
more.
The disastrous 39-0 defeat ad- j
ministered by the Calcub power- {
house was the only serious setback
of the season.

Paulman Stars
If Coach Jim Bradshaw brought !
any athlete from out of the high
school files to college stardom it was j
Bill Paulman, stocky, blond fullback.
This boy is rated as a good bet for
a first-line reserve post on the '35
varsity, behind the Graysons, Alus- 1
tizas, et al. His passing is the best
in the school, his kicking is long, :
high, and sure, and he shows an i
all-aroufid presence of football poise, i
Other backfielders who played an
above - average brand of ball
throughout the season were Tom
Collins, Jimmy CofTis, and Doc Luc
kctt at the halves, Ed Gillette and |
Bill Roberts at quarter, and Glenn
Hamilton at full. These will find it
tough going with the veteran var
sity stars i next year, but will take,
part in the wide-open, free-for-all
scramble that looms in 1936, after the i
great class of that year has received
diplomas.
Holdridge Captain
In the line, standout heavy-duty i
men were the ends and honorary ;
captain Jay Holdridge at guard. ,
Bernie Layer, light but aggressive
end, wound up the season with a j
sterling ball game against the much
heavier Cal babes. Grant Stone, Bob
Dakan, and John Wyeth are other !
varsity possibilities at the flanks.
Holdridge, diminutive, scarcely 170 1
pounds, led the interference and
crashed through the defense often
enough and well enough to warrant
being chosen team leader. His fierce
blocking and tackling and heady
play place him in a class parallel to
that of Walt Heinecke several years |
ago.
Cy O'oerg, Irv Henningson, and
Howard Bell played steadily at tac
kles. R.uss McKinney and John
Partridge at guards and Nellie Hedth
at center were other line stars, play
ing in all of the games.
