# BEAR FROSH BOAST BRILLIANT RECORD
## 
### 
The performance of the Cal Frosh
this season bodes optimism for the
next three seasons. Only 13 points
were tallied against them all sea
son, while they ran up a total of
nearly 200 points. Future varsity
material filled every position.
Both line and backfield were
strong. Captain Bob Herwig at
eentcr, big and fast, had "his man"
on the ground most of the time.
Vard Stockton and Charlie Wheeler
at guards, Newton and Pollack at
tackles, and Hay and Sparks at end
all showed probabilities of varsity
caliber.
Dave Out, John In
The backfield was led by John
Meek at quarter, who called "the
plays and made it easy for the ball
carriers with plenty of sure and
timely blocking. This roly-poly lad
will take his tall brother Dave's
place on the varsity next year. â€¢
Ham Poole and Jack Howard were
the outstanding Babe ball-carriers.
Poole was more of the crashing type,
and Howard the open field runner,
but both could take the ball any
time, any place, anywhere.
Sam Chapman and John Gilbert
complete the list of Calcub back
field standouts, although others
looked nice against the Card babes.

Connie Mack bought Lefty Grove
for the Philadelphia Americans from
the Baltimore Internationals for
$100,000 just ten years ago.
