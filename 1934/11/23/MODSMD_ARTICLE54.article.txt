# ARMY OF WORKERS SET FOR DEMANDING THRONGS

More than 70.000 district citi
zens and their families will descend
on Berkeley's stadium tomoffow to
see 22 men fight over a pig-skin
oval. But while the crowd roars and
bang out modern his
tory to an army of stay-at-homes,
there will be big things going on
that you may get your hot dog, your
soda pop, your weeds and your train
ride.
Fifteen hundred unseen and un
known workers, some busy far in
the depths of the stadium structure,
will keep the wheels of California's
greatest show in even and integrated
motion, according to O. H. Tucker,
Stanford manager of operations.
Their labors started more than mx
months ago, when presses began
turning out the 1,000.000 pieces of
printed matter necessary to the
game. Tickets, receipts, filing cards,
programs—all were designed or ed
ited, and run oft in staggering num
bers long before the public sensed
the first wave of big-game lension.
Two hundred forty newsmen and
radio announcers have for weeks
been rewiring their press boxes,
planning for pictures, seeing thai
the telegraphic and electrical con
nections were well-placed and "live."
With them, as with the lowliest ush
er, nothing can slip on Big Game
Day. You can't fool with 70,000
people.

''Comps"—there aren't any to be
had. Three hundred forty consti
tute the total number, and 240 of
these are going to accredited repre
sentatives of press and radio.
Meanwhile, East-bay butchers and
bottlers are cleaning up the last of
their year's biggest order. More
than 4.000 yards of hot dogs are
ready to be flopped on griddles and
washed down thirsty throats with
13,000 pints of soda pop.
If the tickets that will find their
way into gate receipt boxes were
laid end to end they would form a
round-trip ribbon from the stadium
to the heart of San Francisco, sta
tastics show. Cigarettes smoked will
equal the Big Game bonfire.
Private detectives and traffic po
lice are girding up their diction for
verbal tussles with 40.000 Saturday
drivers, impatient to get to the game,
and more impatient to get home and
away to dawn-bound parties.

France just launched a "Buy .
French" campaign.
