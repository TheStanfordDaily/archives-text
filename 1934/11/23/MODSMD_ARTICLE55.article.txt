# Track Weights Show Strength For '35 Season
## Cardinal Chances Usually Based on Field Events 
### Mort D'Evelyn 
Perennial followers of the for
tunes of Dink Templeton's> Cardinal
track teams have gotten into the
habit in recent years of predicting
the strength of Indian squads by the
quality of the weight tossers, taking
it for granted that there will be the
usual number of star performers in
the other events.
For example, Stanford fans ac
cept unconsciously, almost as a mat
ter of course, that the 1935 track
team will have a hurdler who can
be listed as the favorite in every race
entered, Sam Klopstock; a 220-foot,
javelin thrower, John Mottram; a
quarter-miler who can be ranked as
the fastest collegiate man on the
Coast, A1 Blackman; or a 4:19 miler,
Chuck Nimmo.

What, the fans want to know is
whether Templeton will have shot
putters and discus throwers that can
be counted on for 15 or 18 points
in every meet entered, as the Stan
ford "weight circus" has done for the
past four or five years. Is the de
veloper of such national champs as
Bob Jones, Heic Laborde, Gordon
Dunn in the discus and Eriot Krenz,
Nellie Gray, and John Lyman in the
shot-put going to have men of equal
caliber? More weight champs have
been developed on Angell Field
during the last ten years than on
any other track in the country. What
about '35?

Last spring the outlook for another
set of first place discus and shot men
was gloomy. With Lyman and Dunn
through with collegiate competi
tion, Templeton was without the
point-winning juniors to carry over
into the next season. He did have
Jim Reynolds, who set a new Little
Big Meet record, 48 feet 3 inches, in
the shot last April; and Howard
Buller, third place winner in the
discus against Cal, as men who could
be counted on as point winners.
But Stanford seems to be particu
larly attractive to the junior trans
fers among the discus throwers, and
the Cards now have Hal King and
Phil Levy, two men who should be
sure point winners. With 152-foot,
148-foot, and 139-foot tosses, Stan
ford swept the discus event in the
1934 Big Meet. Levy has a disquali
fied mark of 149 feet already, and
one of 146 feet 7 inches when he
did stay in the ring. King has a mark
of 143 feet to his credit this fall.
Others working out in the discus
circle are Gig Holloway, who threw
141 feet last spring, Hugh Gribben,
Mel Hurley, and Doug Spencer.
Reynolds is as yet the only shot
putter with exceptional promise.
The fact that his marks this fall
have not approached those he made
last spring is because Reynolds has
been concentrating on form, leaving
the "punching" for spring. Other
possible shot-putters are Bob Rey
nolds and Claude Callaway, varsity
tackles, who showed potentialities
last spring.

caliber? More weight champs have
been developed on Angell Field
during the last ten years than on
any other track in the country. What
about '35?

Last spring the outlook for another
set of first place discus and shot men
was gloomy. With Lyman and Dunn
through with collegiate competi
tion, Templeton was without the
point-winning juniors to carry over
into the next season. He did have
Jim Reynolds, who set a new Little
Big Meet record, 48 feet 3 inches, in
the shot last April; and Howard
Buller, third place winner in the
discus against Cal, as men who could
be counted on as point winners.
But Stanford seems to be particu
larly attractive to the junior trans
fers among the discus throwers, and
the Cards now have Hal King and
Phil Levy, two men who should be
sure point winners. With 152-foot,
148-foot, and 139-foot tosses, Stan
ford swept the discus event in the
1934 Big Meet. Levy has a disquali
fied mark of 149 feet already, and
one of 146 feet 7 inches when he
did stay in the ring. King has a mark
of 143 feet to his credit this fall.
Others working out in the discus
circle are Gig Holloway, who threw
141 feet last spring, Hugh Gribben,
Mel Hurley, and Doug Spencer.
Reynolds is as yet the only shot
putter with exceptional promise.
The fact that his marks this fall
have not approached those he made
last spring is because Reynolds has
been concentrating on form, leaving
the "punching" for spring. Other
possible shot-putters are Bob Rey
nolds and Claude Callaway, varsity
tackles, who showed potentialities
last spring.
Perennial followers of the for
tunes of Dink Templeton's> Cardinal
track teams have gotten into the
habit in recent years of predicting
the strength of Indian squads by the
quality of the weight tossers, taking
it for granted that there will be the
usual number of star performers in
the other events.
For example, Stanford fans ac
cept unconsciously, almost as a mat
ter of course, that the 1935 track
team will have a hurdler who can
be listed as the favorite in every race
entered, Sam Klopstock; a 220-foot,
javelin thrower, John Mottram; a
quarter-miler who can be ranked as
the fastest collegiate man on the
Coast, A1 Blackman; or a 4:19 miler,
Chuck Nimmo.

What, the fans want to know is
whether Templeton will have shot
putters and discus throwers that can
be counted on for 15 or 18 points
in every meet entered, as the Stan
ford "weight circus" has done for the
past four or five years. Is the de
veloper of such national champs as
Bob Jones, Heic Laborde, Gordon
Dunn in the discus and Eriot Krenz,
Nellie Gray, and John Lyman in the
shot-put going to have men of equal
caliber? More weight champs have
been developed on Angell Field
during the last ten years than on
any other track in the country. What
