# Soccer Squad Invades Cal Tomorrow
## TEAM BRACED FOR COMEBACK AFTER WEDNESDAY'S FALL First, Second Strings Will Make Trip; Starting Line-up in Doubt 
### John McClelland 
Soccermen will get up off the mat
tomorrow morning and brace them
selves for a last crack at the team
that gave them one on the chin last
Wednesday.
The Cardinals play California at
10 o'clock in Berkeley.
It's been many long years since a
Stanford team has failed to defeat
the Bears at least once during a sea
son and the responsibility of contin
uing what has come to be almost a
tradition rests on eleven men to
morrow. They will have to play in
spired soccer to win.
Punch Lacking
With a smooth-kicking, expe
rienced outfit, the Bears took the
measure of the Cards Wednesday
(J-2. The Indians didn't seem to be
able to get goingâ€”they lacked ag
gressiveness. In practice last night
ihe fighting spirit still was absent.
The second-string repeatedly out
played the men in red.
So it won't be for revenge that
Maloney's men go to Berkeley to
morrow; it will be to redeem them
selves. To prove to their coach, to
Cal, and to themselves that they are
capable of playing as good a brand
of soccer as teams of other years.
Maloney is taking his regular first
and second strings across the bay
tomorrow. The complete starting
line-up is in question.
Bull is Injured
One of the mainstays of defense,
Dick Bullis, was injured to such an
extent Wednesday that he will not be
able to play. Barney Vierling will
take his place in the right fullback
position. Bud Wilson will team up
with Vierling in the other back post.
Of all the parts of the team, ihe
halfbacks functioned best in the first
Cal tilt. Bob Hall, Waddy White, and
Ruddy Gonzales all played a good
game and all will be in the line-up
tomorrow.
Steve Enke will probably be
started at left wing with Herb Saw
yer, Pete Knecht, or Jeeb Halaby on
the right. Ron Row will be in again
at inside left and either A1 Navarro
or Dick Forhan will play center for
ward. Mike Gomez, A1 Dibblee, or
Win.stead Weaver will be used at
inside right.
The team will leave for Berkeley
from in front of Eneina Gymnasium
tomorrow morning at 8 o'clock.
