# ASSASSINATION INQUIRY ASKED BY JUGOSLAVS
## Hungary Blamed for Acts Calculated To Upset Nations' Peace 
### 
GENEVA, Nov. 22 (/P).—Jugosla
via today lodged a formal complaint
against Hungary, asking the League
of Nations Council to investigate the
assassinations of King Alexander of
Jugoslavia and Foreign Minister
Louis Barthou of France as acts cal
culated to disturb international
peace.
M. Fotich, the Jugoslav delegate
to the League, sent a letter to J. A.
C. Avenol secretary general, re
questing that the matter be placed
on the Council agenda for discus
sion.
Delegates Complain
The Jugoslav delegate alleged:
"The investigation into the Marseille
assassinations brought to light the
fact that they were prepared on
Hungarian soil by a band of inter
national terrorists."
The letter said that a memorandum
detailing the police investigations in
several countries will be forwarded
to the League later.

Jugoslavia's complaint, the letter
said, is lodged under article XI, par
agraph II of the League Covenant,
which says: "It is the friendly right
of each member of the League to
bring to the attention of the Assem
bly or the Council any circumstan
ces whatever affecting international
relations which threaten to disturb
international peace or the good un
derstanding between nations on
which peace depends."
Backing Expected
Czechoslovakia and Rumania, Ju
goslavia's partners in the Little En
tente, were expected to hand Avenol
similar letters tonight, backing the
Slav kingdom's request that the
Council investigate alleged terrorist
camps in .Hungary.
The letters, it is expected, will
assert these two countries also were
"injured" by the assassinations.
The Jugoslav complaint says:
"The odious crimes at Marseille
stunned civilized people, and they
arc of such nature as to disturb the
good relations between Jugoslavia
and her neighbor, Hungary."
The three-page letter recalled the
deep emotions of the Jugoslavs at
the death of their King and indicated
League action was necessary to give
the masses of Jugoslavia satisfac
tion. It was not believed, however,
that the Council would discuss the
matter until next. year.
Complicity Charged
Jugoslavia directly charged Hun
gary with "complicity" in the assas
sinations.
"The investigations after the as
sassinations," said the letter, "show
the criminal acts were organized and
executed with the participation of
terrorist elements in Hungary . . . I
and it was only with the complicity
of certain Hungarian authorities that
the idious act of Marseille was per
petrated."
Elsewhere in the note Jugoslavia
declared: j
"If the best servants of a nation
and the firmest pillars of interna
tional peace can be killed while ac
complishing their duty by organized
criminals who enjoy the facilities i
and the support of the authorities
of a foreign country, organized go'v
crnment would be no no longer pos
sible.

"The investigation into the Marseille
assassinations brought to light the
fact that they were prepared on
Hungarian soil by a band of inter
national terrorists."
The letter said that a memorandum
detailing the police investigations in
several countries will be forwarded
to the League later.

Jugoslavia's complaint, the letter
said, is lodged under article XI, par
agraph II of the League Covenant,
which says: "It is the friendly right
of each member of the League to
bring to the attention of the Assem
bly or the Council any circumstan
ces whatever affecting international
relations which threaten to disturb
international peace or the good un
derstanding between nations on
which peace depends."
Backing Expected
Czechoslovakia and Rumania, Ju
goslavia's partners in the Little En
tente, were expected to hand Avenol
similar letters tonight, backing the
Slav kingdom's request that the
Council investigate alleged terrorist
camps in .Hungary.
The letters, it is expected, will
assert these two countries also were
"injured" by the assassinations.
The Jugoslav complaint says:
"The odious crimes at Marseille
stunned civilized people, and they
arc of such nature as to disturb the
good relations between Jugoslavia
and her neighbor, Hungary."
The three-page letter recalled the
deep emotions of the Jugoslavs at
the death of their King and indicated
League action was necessary to give
the masses of Jugoslavia satisfac
tion. It was not believed, however,
that the Council would discuss the
matter until next. year.
Complicity Charged
Jugoslavia directly charged Hun
gary with "complicity" in the assas
sinations.
"The investigations after the as
sassinations," said the letter, "show
the criminal acts were organized and
executed with the participation of
terrorist elements in Hungary . . . I
and it was only with the complicity
of certain Hungarian authorities that
the idious act of Marseille was per
petrated."
Elsewhere in the note Jugoslavia
declared: j
"If the best servants of a nation
and the firmest pillars of interna
tional peace can be killed while ac
complishing their duty by organized
criminals who enjoy the facilities i
and the support of the authorities
of a foreign country, organized go'v
crnment would be no no longer pos
sible.
