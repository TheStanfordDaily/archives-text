# WATER POLO SQUAD WILL MEET BEARS FOR HEAVY STAKES
## Lead in Conference, League Will Be Decided 
### 
It will be all or nothing for Stan
ford's varsity water polo team to
morrow. When the Indians play the
Bears in their Berkeley pool at 11
o'clock, first place in both the confer
ence and the league standings, Stan
ford's record of no defeats at the
hands of California in 21 years of
the aquatic sport, and the great ri
valry of a toss-up game will all bs
at stake.
The Cards are almost assured of
the Pacific Coast Conference cham
pionship, but the Bears still have a
good chance for the Northern Cali
fornia Water Polo League crown.
Undefeated in the past two seasons,
titlists in both circuits, and indivi
dually brilliant, Stanford would or
dinarily be a heavy favorite to win
this game.
Bears Real Threat
Terrific speed, perfect teamwork,
and a great fighting spirit give Coach
A1 Dowden's California septet an
even chance to win tomorrow. His
smoothly,, working water machine
has amazed with its ability all sea
son. It might be said that California
seems to have everything where
there should be nothing.
A man-l'or-man comparison fa
vors the Indians, but the Bears have
four of the Coast's finest players in
Captain Davis, Danny Kuhns, and
Dean Langworthy at forwards and
goalie Johnson. Three steady and
powerful guards give them a strong
defense.
Comparative scores, which should
not be taken too seriously even in
water polo, favor Stanford mainly as
to defensive play. Season records
of the two teams to date are as fol
lows:

Every man on the team played a
great game as the Cardinals again
trounced the Olympic Club, 3 to 2,
in San Francisco Wednesday night.
Leo Cook scored all three goals, in
spite of the expert guarding ot
George Mitchell, Olympic Games
veteran on the club seven. Half
time score was tied at 1-all.
Indian Backs
Stanford's guards. Bill Woodard,
Wally Wiget, and Jimmy Benet, de
serve special credit for the Indian
victory, since they stopped nearly
every scoring drive launched by the
club. This veteran trio also starred
on offense, passing to Vlad Taranik
and Bob Foster at forwards, or di
rectly to "Cookie" in the hole.
Taranik and Foster, though held
scoreless by the great club defense,
played as well as ever, and Bob
Haslacher in the goal proved himself
in a class with Collette of the

Winged "O" and Johnson of the'
Bears, two top-notch goalies. Whitey
Burns scored the first Club goal, and |
Ginger Austin the second on a free j
throw.
J.V.'s Lose to Club
Nort Thoi-nton's junior varsity
j barely lost to the Club reserves, 3
to 4, in a preliminary game which I
ran four extra periods. Don Peter- i
son rang up two goals for the Card i
jayvees, and Pierson Dean and Bob I
Hoover made one each.
The Indian-Bear fracas tomorrow
morning will be played in the pool
in the Men's Gym at Berkeley. Prob-
I able starting line-ups are as fol
lows:
Stanford: sprint, Taranik; for
-1 wards, Cook (c.) and Foster; guards,
Woodard, Wiget, and Benet or Suth

and Bob Foster at forwards, or di
rectly to "Cookie" in the hole.
Taranik and Foster, though held
scoreless by the great club defense,
played as well as ever, and Bob
Haslacher in the goal proved himself
in a class with Collette of the

Winged "O" and Johnson of the'
Bears, two top-notch goalies. Whitey
Burns scored the first Club goal, and |
Ginger Austin the second on a free j
throw.
J.V.'s Lose to Club
Nort Thoi-nton's junior varsity
j barely lost to the Club reserves, 3
to 4, in a preliminary game which I
ran four extra periods. Don Peter- i
son rang up two goals for the Card i
jayvees, and Pierson Dean and Bob I
Hoover made one each.
The Indian-Bear fracas tomorrow
morning will be played in the pool
in the Men's Gym at Berkeley. Prob-
I able starting line-ups are as fol
lows:
Stanford: sprint, Taranik; for
-1 wards, Cook (c.) and Foster; guards,
Woodard, Wiget, and Benet or Suth
erland; goalie, Haslacher.
California: sprint, Davis (c.); ,
forwards, Kuhns and Langworthy;
1 guards, Smith, Dozier, and Heinecke;
goalie, Johnson.
Wiget and Smith will play the po
i sition of center back.

It will be all or nothing for Stan
ford's varsity water polo team to
morrow. When the Indians play the
Bears in their Berkeley pool at 11
o'clock, first place in both the confer
ence and the league standings, Stan
ford's record of no defeats at the
hands of California in 21 years of
the aquatic sport, and the great ri
valry of a toss-up game will all bs
at stake.
The Cards are almost assured of
the Pacific Coast Conference cham
pionship, but the Bears still have a
good chance for the Northern Cali
fornia Water Polo League crown.
Undefeated in the past two seasons,
titlists in both circuits, and indivi
dually brilliant, Stanford would or
dinarily be a heavy favorite to win
this game.
Bears Real Threat
Terrific speed, perfect teamwork,
and a great fighting spirit give Coach
A1 Dowden's California septet an
even chance to win tomorrow. His
smoothly,, working water machine
has amazed with its ability all sea
son. It might be said that California
seems to have everything where
there should be nothing.
A man-l'or-man comparison fa
vors the Indians, but the Bears have
four of the Coast's finest players in
Captain Davis, Danny Kuhns, and
Dean Langworthy at forwards and
goalie Johnson. Three steady and
powerful guards give them a strong
defense.
Comparative scores, which should
not be taken too seriously even in
water polo, favor Stanford mainly as
to defensive play. Season records
of the two teams to date are as fol

Every man on the team played a
great game as the Cardinals again
trounced the Olympic Club, 3 to 2,
in San Francisco Wednesday night.
Leo Cook scored all three goals, in
spite of the expert guarding ot
George Mitchell, Olympic Games
veteran on the club seven. Half
time score was tied at 1-all.
Indian Backs
Stanford's guards. Bill Woodard,
Wally Wiget, and Jimmy Benet, de
serve special credit for the Indian
victory, since they stopped nearly
every scoring drive launched by the
club. This veteran trio also starred
on offense, passing to Vlad Taranik
and Bob Foster at forwards, or di
rectly to "Cookie" in the hole.
Taranik and Foster, though held
scoreless by the great club defense,
played as well as ever, and Bob
Haslacher in the goal proved himself
in a class with Collette of the

Winged "O" and Johnson of the'
Bears, two top-notch goalies. Whitey
Burns scored the first Club goal, and |
Ginger Austin the second on a free j
throw.
J.V.'s Lose to Club
Nort Thoi-nton's junior varsity
j barely lost to the Club reserves, 3
to 4, in a preliminary game which I
ran four extra periods. Don Peter- i
son rang up two goals for the Card i
jayvees, and Pierson Dean and Bob I
Hoover made one each.
The Indian-Bear fracas tomorrow
morning will be played in the pool
in the Men's Gym at Berkeley. Prob-
I able starting line-ups are as fol
lows:
Stanford: sprint, Taranik; for
-1 wards, Cook (c.) and Foster; guards,
Woodard, Wiget, and Benet or Suth
erland; goalie, Haslacher.
California: sprint, Davis (c.); ,
forwards, Kuhns and Langworthy;
1 guards, Smith, Dozier, and Heinecke;
goalie, Johnson.
Wiget and Smith will play the po
i sition of center back.

It will be all or nothing for Stan
ford's varsity water polo team to
morrow. When the Indians play the
Bears in their Berkeley pool at 11
o'clock, first place in both the confer
ence and the league standings, Stan
ford's record of no defeats at the
hands of California in 21 years of
the aquatic sport, and the great ri
valry of a toss-up game will all bs
at stake.
The Cards are almost assured of
the Pacific Coast Conference cham
pionship, but the Bears still have a
good chance for the Northern Cali
fornia Water Polo League crown.
Undefeated in the past two seasons,
titlists in both circuits, and indivi
dually brilliant, Stanford would or
dinarily be a heavy favorite to win
this game.
Bears Real Threat
Terrific speed, perfect teamwork,
and a great fighting spirit give Coach
A1 Dowden's California septet an
even chance to win tomorrow. His
smoothly,, working water machine
has amazed with its ability all sea
son. It might be said that California
seems to have everything where
there should be nothing.
A man-l'or-man comparison fa
vors the Indians, but the Bears have
four of the Coast's finest players in
Captain Davis, Danny Kuhns, and
Dean Langworthy at forwards and
goalie Johnson. Three steady and
powerful guards give them a strong
defense.
Comparative scores, which should
not be taken too seriously even in
water polo, favor Stanford mainly as
to defensive play. Season records
of the two teams to date are as fol
lows:
