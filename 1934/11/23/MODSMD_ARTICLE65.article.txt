# INDIAN CAGE PROSPECTS GOOD FOR 1935 SEASON
## 
### PHIL DUFFY 
Stanford is the team to beat!
That is what the basketball
coaches at U.C., U.S.C., and U.C.L.A.
are saying to draw attention away
I from their own teams.
I Nibs Price of California in writing
for the Basketball Guide Official
' Rule Book, picks Stanford as the
team to beat in the 1935 Pacific
I Coast Conference basketball season,
i Price perhaps is hardest hit of the
conference coaches, for his problem
| is the building of an entire new team.
And inasmuch as Stanford has all
but one player from the freshman
team that defeated the Cal Babes
decisively in all three games of then
series last year returning for varsity
competition, things do not look so
i rosy for the Bear mentor.
S.C. Too Pessimistic
I Sam Barry of the Trojans, how
' ever, should not be crying so loud,
for he has only the replacing of
two men lost via the graduation
route. And in the South where
there is so much athletic material
this should not be hard to do. Pierce
Works, coach at U.C.L.A., is liable
to supply the upsetting factor in
conference play when his Uclan
| varsity takes the floor.
Perhaps the big hullabaloo comes
from the fact that for the first time
since 1921, when Walt Powell
coached the Indians to conference i
title and Swede Righter was a big
star, Stanford seems ready to put
one of its most formidable basketball
teams in the race for Pacific Coast
honors.
Center Is Problem
But why the hue and cry just be
cause Stanford has some 60-odd bas
ketball players from which to mold ]
a team of varsity caliber? Gradua- J
tion last year left the Indian team
with a big hole right in the center, !

when Captain Harold Edelen stepped j
out and left John Bunn with the
serious problem of filling the center
position. Forwards and guards are ,
numerous, but good centers are hard
to find, especially when they have
to fill such a gap.
Kenny Nobs, who made his letter j
last year but saw comparatively
little real action, is doing his utmost
to fill the space left by Edelen and
is doing very well at his task. Nobs
is only a junior and in two years'
time should develop into something
well worth watching. Kenneth Bell,
a good forward from the freshman
quintet, is being tried out at cen
ter and may help to bolster that !
position. YVytze Gorter, regular for
ward, started practice sessions at j
center but with the advent of Nobs
was glad to return to his forward I
berth.
Action Foreseen
Rod Bost and Hal Turner have j
developed into a pair of fast and I
rugged forwards that will make Gor
ter step if he wants to play first j
string. Robin Lindsey, "Dinty"
Moore, and Gordon Mallatratt are
showing up well at the guard posi- j
tions and will probably see plenty
of action this coming season.
Stanford's conference team will
be smaller than that of other uni
versities, but will make up for this j
deficiency in their fast break and
ability to hit the hoop. Coach Bunn
is not taking the chant of the other
coaches too seriously, but it is cer
tain that the Stanford five that
takes to the hardwood against Cali
fornia or any other conference op
ponent will be a well-seasoned team.

During the 1912 season, Jim
Thorpe of Carlisle, immortal full
-1 back, scored 198 points.

I from their own teams.
I Nibs Price of California in writing

' Rule Book, picks Stanford as the
team to beat in the 1935 Pacific
I Coast Conference basketball season,
i Price perhaps is hardest hit of the
conference coaches, for his problem
| is the building of an entire new team.
And inasmuch as Stanford has all
but one player from the freshman
team that defeated the Cal Babes
decisively in all three games of then
series last year returning for varsity
competition, things do not look so
i rosy for the Bear mentor.
S.C. Too Pessimistic
I Sam Barry of the Trojans, how
' ever, should not be crying so loud,
for he has only the replacing of
two men lost via the graduation
route. And in the South where
there is so much athletic material
this should not be hard to do. Pierce
Works, coach at U.C.L.A., is liable
to supply the upsetting factor in
conference play when his Uclan
| varsity takes the floor.
Perhaps the big hullabaloo comes
from the fact that for the first time
since 1921, when Walt Powell
coached the Indians to conference i
title and Swede Righter was a big
star, Stanford seems ready to put
one of its most formidable basketball
teams in the race for Pacific Coast
honors.
Center Is Problem
But why the hue and cry just be
cause Stanford has some 60-odd bas
ketball players from which to mold ]
a team of varsity caliber? Gradua- J
tion last year left the Indian team
with a big hole right in the center, !

when Captain Harold Edelen stepped j
out and left John Bunn with the
serious problem of filling the center
position. Forwards and guards are ,
numerous, but good centers are hard
to find, especially when they have
to fill such a gap.
Kenny Nobs, who made his letter j
last year but saw comparatively
little real action, is doing his utmost
to fill the space left by Edelen and
is doing very well at his task. Nobs
is only a junior and in two years'
time should develop into something
well worth watching. Kenneth Bell,
a good forward from the freshman
quintet, is being tried out at cen
ter and may help to bolster that !
position. YVytze Gorter, regular for
ward, started practice sessions at j
center but with the advent of Nobs
was glad to return to his forward I
berth.
Action Foreseen
Rod Bost and Hal Turner have j
developed into a pair of fast and I
rugged forwards that will make Gor
ter step if he wants to play first j
string. Robin Lindsey, "Dinty"
Moore, and Gordon Mallatratt are
showing up well at the guard posi- j
tions and will probably see plenty
of action this coming season.
Stanford's conference team will
be smaller than that of other uni
versities, but will make up for this j
deficiency in their fast break and
ability to hit the hoop. Coach Bunn
is not taking the chant of the other
coaches too seriously, but it is cer
tain that the Stanford five that
takes to the hardwood against Cali
fornia or any other conference op
ponent will be a well-seasoned team.
