# NEW DRAMA CLUB TO MEET MONDAY
## 
### 
For students who are genuinely
interested in dramatics but are un
'tble to turn nut for campus produc
tions, Miss Elisabeth Buckingham of
the English department has organ
ized a club to work on all phases
of drama. The purpose of the club
is to keep alive the interest in dra
matics among lower classmen and to
provide opportunity for upper class
mer to direct plays.
Miss Buckingham stresses that the
club has been started because the
enrollment in public speaking and
'Iramatics courses is limited, and that
no experience or qualifications are
necessary for membership other
than interest and a desire to partici
pate in plays.
The second meeting of the club
will be held Monday evening at 8
>'c:lock at Miss Buckingham's home,
534 Lasuen.
