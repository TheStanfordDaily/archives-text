ners four months from now. Kneu
buhle has been consistently win
ning sprints in the interciass meets.,

Leo Madlem and Tom Collins are j
two 2l>-foot broad-jumpers, a mark .
which usually wins varsity compe
tition. The other standout is Edson i
Burroughs, a 4:29 iniler from Wash- j

much greater than a year ago.
