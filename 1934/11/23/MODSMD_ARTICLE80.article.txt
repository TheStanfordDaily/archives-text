# U.C. May Upset Indians' Title Aspirations
## MANY GRIDIRON TEAMS VIE FOR ROSE BOWL BID Minnesota, Pit, Alabama Lead Eastern Fight For Invitation CARDS NEARLY CINCH Coast Team Will Be Chosen Tomorrow Night 
### Phil Duffy 
By Phil Duffy

As the sun begins to slowly set on j
old King Football's 1034 season, the
nations' critics begin to delve into |
records in an effort to pick two foot- {
ball teams that will represent thej
western and eastern sectors of the !
country in the Tournament of Roses '
at Pasadena on New Year's Day; a 1
game that brings the gridiron sea- ■
son to a glorious climax in the battle
between two elevens that have de-

A telegraphic ballot of the
Rose Bowl committee will he
taken Saturday evening imme- '
(iiately after the Big Game, it
was announced by Hugh Wil
lett, president of the Pacific
Coast Conference. Saturday
evening the western participant
will be announced and Sun
day's papers will carry a com
plete story on the voting of the
committee.

fied defeat and vanquishing all have
gained the coveted honor of being
selected to play in the Rose Bowl.
Cards Pride of West
In the West, Stanford, the only un
defeated major team west of the
Rockies, the least scored on team in
the United States, and the sixth
highest scoring eleven in the coun-
try, is the natural selection to rep
resent this sector.
Tin; Indians have only one more
liurdie- before they enter the Pasa
dena Bowl and that is the California
game. A win for Tiny Thornhill's
men should mean an invitation from
ihe Ro.se bowl committee. Stanford
has amassed a total of 202 points 10
the opponents' seven in nine games.
Minnesota Ranks High
In ihe Big Ten Conference the
Minn: .ota Gophers lead the parade
with six wins and no defeats. In
those six contests the powerful
Gopher backs, led by the All-Ameri
can Pug Lund, have run up a total
of 21 (5 points. In only one game
have they failed to run up loss than
30 points and that was in defeating
Pittsburgh, 13-7.
'I lie idea! opponent for a west
ern eleven in the New Year's
classic, .Minnesota is hampered by
;i Big Ten ruling which disap
proves of post-season games. One
chance in a million is that the
Gophers will forget the ruling and
accept the hid which i* almost
certain to Ise offered them.
Illinois and Ohio State also in the
Big Ten have been defeated once
each. Ohio State with 227 points
places third in the nation's scorers
although neither team can reach the
class of Minnesota, and probably
neither will be asked ' to the Rose
Bowl in the event that Minnesota
refuses.
Crimson Tide Unbeaten
Next to the Gophers in considera
tion for the western trip will be the
Crimson Tide from Alabama, twice
participating in the Rose Bowl and
twice emerging the victor. The Tide
leads the nation in scoring with 253
points scored in eight games. Ala
bama has 12 consecutive victories,
their last loss to Fordham, 2-0, in
1933. The Crimson Tide will in al!
events jump at the chance to again
play in Pasadena, but they cannot be
placed in a class with either Minne
sota or Pittsburgh due tv the dif
ference in schedules.
Louisiana State, pride and joy of
Ihe Kingfush, is still undefeated but
tied twice. Ilusy Long will probably
take them to bask in the soft sun
light of Miami should the Orange
Blossom game mature. Rice also
boasts of a clean record with only
one tie, but it is unlikely either of
these teams will get any notice by
the' Pasadena committee.
Tigers Win Fourteen
Mighty Princeton with 14 straight
victories and their total reaching 242
points for six games this season, fed
before the ghost of old E!i 7-0. f iist
il was Dartmouth, who, undefeated,
united and unscored on, lost to Yale
7-2 and then the Tigers.
Another ruling, this time of the
Big Three, would probably have kept
Princeton from accepting an invita
tion to California, so few tears will
be shed at her defeat
Pop Warner's Temple Owls. 011 a
nf the six remaining undefeated
teams, also might have aspiration,
out inasmuch as the University of
3an Francisco is planning to open
legotiations with Temple tor a post
-1 ...son game in Kezar Stadium in
3an Francisco, the Rose Bowl com
nitiec will likely let it go at that.
Beside.-, the Owls have two more
james coming up with teams that
Deat them by 20 points last year and
nay be toppled. 1
Columbia Loses One
Lrst we be accused of pointedly
'orgetiing, we will mention Colum
bia, the team picked for the East
ast year. Lou Little's men after j
naking it six straight by beating j
Stanford 7-0 added two more this!
season and then ran into a snag
when Navy beat them 18-7. Since j
h<'n Columbia has won four games,
jut the wealth of strong teams in ;
he East will not warrant their being
isked again.
In the same class Colgate and Sy
•acuse have hut one defeat to mar
heir record. Their schedules are not
is tough as several other teams
vorthy of note and it is possible
hat neither team will be mentioned
•; contestants for right to play in
he West.
Pitt Panthers Strong
Last but not least on our list are.
he Pittsburgh Panthers, beaten,

only by the mighty Minnesota team '
in a tight 13-7 game. The Panthers
seem to come closest to the type of !
football shown by Minnesota, beat
ing such teams as Notre Dame, Navy, j
and Nebraska by a good margin.
We could also bring in the Army
and Navy, who have each been
beaten once, and one of them will
have two losses after they meet, but .
it probably would take an act of
Congress to send them out and wc ,
don't believe the committee will go
to that trouble, especially when
there are several teams as food, if
not better, waiting to come.
After all is said and done we pick
Minnesota for first choice, Pittsburgh
for second, and Alabama for third.
Charles Brick ley scored 26 field |
goals during his college football ca- I
reer at Harvard. He made 13 of these J
during the 1913 season.

In the Big Game of 1000, William
Traegor kicked a 50-yard drop kick
1 for a Stanford victory and the long
j est field goal ever registered by a
j Stanford man.

day's papers will carry a com
plete story on the voting of the
committee.

fied defeat and vanquishing all have
gained the coveted honor of being
selected to play in the Rose Bowl.
Cards Pride of West
In the West, Stanford, the only un
defeated major team west of the
Rockies, the least scored on team in
the United States, and the sixth
highest scoring eleven in the coun-
try, is the natural selection to rep
resent this sector.
Tin; Indians have only one more
liurdie- before they enter the Pasa
dena Bowl and that is the California
game. A win for Tiny Thornhill's
men should mean an invitation from
ihe Ro.se bowl committee. Stanford
has amassed a total of 202 points 10
the opponents' seven in nine games.
Minnesota Ranks High
In ihe Big Ten Conference the
Minn: .ota Gophers lead the parade
with six wins and no defeats. In
those six contests the powerful
Gopher backs, led by the All-Ameri
can Pug Lund, have run up a total
of 21 (5 points. In only one game
have they failed to run up loss than
30 points and that was in defeating
Pittsburgh, 13-7.
'I lie idea! opponent for a west
ern eleven in the New Year's
classic, .Minnesota is hampered by
;i Big Ten ruling which disap
proves of post-season games. One
chance in a million is that the
Gophers will forget the ruling and
accept the hid which i* almost
certain to Ise offered them.
Illinois and Ohio State also in the
Big Ten have been defeated once
each. Ohio State with 227 points
places third in the nation's scorers
although neither team can reach the
class of Minnesota, and probably
neither will be asked ' to the Rose
Bowl in the event that Minnesota
refuses.
Crimson Tide Unbeaten
Next to the Gophers in considera
tion for the western trip will be the
Crimson Tide from Alabama, twice
participating in the Rose Bowl and
twice emerging the victor. The Tide
leads the nation in scoring with 253
points scored in eight games. Ala
bama has 12 consecutive victories,
their last loss to Fordham, 2-0, in
1933. The Crimson Tide will in al!
events jump at the chance to again
play in Pasadena, but they cannot be
placed in a class with either Minne
sota or Pittsburgh due tv the dif
ference in schedules.
Louisiana State, pride and joy of
Ihe Kingfush, is still undefeated but
tied twice. Ilusy Long will probably
take them to bask in the soft sun
light of Miami should the Orange
Blossom game mature. Rice also
boasts of a clean record with only
one tie, but it is unlikely either of
these teams will get any notice by
the' Pasadena committee.
Tigers Win Fourteen
Mighty Princeton with 14 straight
victories and their total reaching 242
points for six games this season, fed
before the ghost of old E!i 7-0. f iist
il was Dartmouth, who, undefeated,
united and unscored on, lost to Yale
7-2 and then the Tigers.
Another ruling, this time of the
Big Three, would probably have kept
Princeton from accepting an invita
tion to California, so few tears will
be shed at her defeat
Pop Warner's Temple Owls. 011 a
nf the six remaining undefeated
teams, also might have aspiration,
out inasmuch as the University of
3an Francisco is planning to open
legotiations with Temple tor a post
-1 ...son game in Kezar Stadium in
3an Francisco, the Rose Bowl com
nitiec will likely let it go at that.
Beside.-, the Owls have two more
james coming up with teams that
Deat them by 20 points last year and
nay be toppled. 1
Columbia Loses One
Lrst we be accused of pointedly
'orgetiing, we will mention Colum
bia, the team picked for the East
ast year. Lou Little's men after j
naking it six straight by beating j
Stanford 7-0 added two more this!
season and then ran into a snag
when Navy beat them 18-7. Since j
h<'n Columbia has won four games,
jut the wealth of strong teams in ;
he East will not warrant their being
isked again.
In the same class Colgate and Sy

Columbia Loses One
Lrst we be accused of pointedly
'orgetiing, we will mention Colum
bia, the team picked for the East
ast year. Lou Little's men after j
naking it six straight by beating j
Stanford 7-0 added two more this!
season and then ran into a snag
when Navy beat them 18-7. Since j
h<'n Columbia has won four games,
jut the wealth of strong teams in ;
he East will not warrant their being
isked again.
In the same class Colgate and Sy
•acuse have hut one defeat to mar
heir record. Their schedules are not
is tough as several other teams
vorthy of note and it is possible
hat neither team will be mentioned
•; contestants for right to play in
he West.
Pitt Panthers Strong
Last but not least on our list are.
he Pittsburgh Panthers, beaten,

only by the mighty Minnesota team '
in a tight 13-7 game. The Panthers
seem to come closest to the type of !
football shown by Minnesota, beat
ing such teams as Notre Dame, Navy, j
and Nebraska by a good margin.
We could also bring in the Army
and Navy, who have each been
beaten once, and one of them will
have two losses after they meet, but .
it probably would take an act of
Congress to send them out and wc ,
don't believe the committee will go
to that trouble, especially when
there are several teams as food, if
not better, waiting to come.
After all is said and done we pick
Minnesota for first choice, Pittsburgh
for second, and Alabama for third.

committee.

fied defeat and vanquishing all have
gained the coveted honor of being
selected to play in the Rose Bowl.
Cards Pride of West
In the West, Stanford, the only un
defeated major team west of the
Rockies, the least scored on team in
the United States, and the sixth
highest scoring eleven in the coun-
try, is the natural selection to rep
resent this sector.
Tin; Indians have only one more
liurdie- before they enter the Pasa
dena Bowl and that is the California
game. A win for Tiny Thornhill's
men should mean an invitation from
ihe Ro.se bowl committee. Stanford
has amassed a total of 202 points 10
the opponents' seven in nine games.
Minnesota Ranks High
In ihe Big Ten Conference the
Minn: .ota Gophers lead the parade
with six wins and no defeats. In
those six contests the powerful
Gopher backs, led by the All-Ameri
can Pug Lund, have run up a total
of 21 (5 points. In only one game
have they failed to run up loss than
30 points and that was in defeating
Pittsburgh, 13-7.
'I lie idea! opponent for a west
ern eleven in the New Year's
classic, .Minnesota is hampered by
;i Big Ten ruling which disap
proves of post-season games. One
chance in a million is that the
Gophers will forget the ruling and
accept the hid which i* almost
certain to Ise offered them.
Illinois and Ohio State also in the
Big Ten have been defeated once
each. Ohio State with 227 points
places third in the nation's scorers
although neither team can reach the
class of Minnesota, and probably
neither will be asked ' to the Rose
Bowl in the event that Minnesota
refuses.
Crimson Tide Unbeaten
Next to the Gophers in considera
tion for the western trip will be the
Crimson Tide from Alabama, twice
participating in the Rose Bowl and
twice emerging the victor. The Tide
leads the nation in scoring with 253
points scored in eight games. Ala
bama has 12 consecutive victories,
their last loss to Fordham, 2-0, in
1933. The Crimson Tide will in al!
events jump at the chance to again
play in Pasadena, but they cannot be
placed in a class with either Minne
sota or Pittsburgh due tv the dif
ference in schedules.
Louisiana State, pride and joy of
Ihe Kingfush, is still undefeated but
tied twice. Ilusy Long will probably
take them to bask in the soft sun
light of Miami should the Orange
Blossom game mature. Rice also
boasts of a clean record with only
one tie, but it is unlikely either of
these teams will get any notice by
the' Pasadena committee.
Tigers Win Fourteen
Mighty Princeton with 14 straight
victories and their total reaching 242
points for six games this season, fed
before the ghost of old E!i 7-0. f iist
il was Dartmouth, who, undefeated,
united and unscored on, lost to Yale
7-2 and then the Tigers.
Another ruling, this time of the
Big Three, would probably have kept
Princeton from accepting an invita
tion to California, so few tears will
be shed at her defeat
Pop Warner's Temple Owls. 011 a

play in Pasadena, but they cannot be
placed in a class with either Minne
sota or Pittsburgh due tv the dif
ference in schedules.
Louisiana State, pride and joy of
Ihe Kingfush, is still undefeated but
tied twice. Ilusy Long will probably
take them to bask in the soft sun
light of Miami should the Orange
Blossom game mature. Rice also
boasts of a clean record with only
one tie, but it is unlikely either of
these teams will get any notice by
the' Pasadena committee.
Tigers Win Fourteen
Mighty Princeton with 14 straight
victories and their total reaching 242
points for six games this season, fed
before the ghost of old E!i 7-0. f iist
il was Dartmouth, who, undefeated,
united and unscored on, lost to Yale
7-2 and then the Tigers.
Another ruling, this time of the
Big Three, would probably have kept
Princeton from accepting an invita
tion to California, so few tears will
be shed at her defeat
Pop Warner's Temple Owls. 011 a
nf the six remaining undefeated
teams, also might have aspiration,
out inasmuch as the University of
3an Francisco is planning to open
legotiations with Temple tor a post
-1 ...son game in Kezar Stadium in
3an Francisco, the Rose Bowl com
nitiec will likely let it go at that.
Beside.-, the Owls have two more
james coming up with teams that
Deat them by 20 points last year and
nay be toppled. 1
Columbia Loses One
Lrst we be accused of pointedly
'orgetiing, we will mention Colum
bia, the team picked for the East
ast year. Lou Little's men after j
naking it six straight by beating j
Stanford 7-0 added two more this!
season and then ran into a snag
when Navy beat them 18-7. Since j
h<'n Columbia has won four games,
jut the wealth of strong teams in ;
he East will not warrant their being
isked again.
In the same class Colgate and Sy
•acuse have hut one defeat to mar
heir record. Their schedules are not
is tough as several other teams
vorthy of note and it is possible
hat neither team will be mentioned
•; contestants for right to play in
he West.
Pitt Panthers Strong
Last but not least on our list are.
he Pittsburgh Panthers, beaten,

only by the mighty Minnesota team '
in a tight 13-7 game. The Panthers
seem to come closest to the type of !
football shown by Minnesota, beat
ing such teams as Notre Dame, Navy, j
and Nebraska by a good margin.
We could also bring in the Army
and Navy, who have each been
beaten once, and one of them will
have two losses after they meet, but .
it probably would take an act of
Congress to send them out and wc ,
don't believe the committee will go
to that trouble, especially when
there are several teams as food, if
not better, waiting to come.
After all is said and done we pick
Minnesota for first choice, Pittsburgh
for second, and Alabama for third.
Charles Brick ley scored 26 field |
goals during his college football ca- I
reer at Harvard. He made 13 of these J
during the 1913 season.

In the Big Game of 1000, William
Traegor kicked a 50-yard drop kick
1 for a Stanford victory and the long
j est field goal ever registered by a
j Stanford man.
