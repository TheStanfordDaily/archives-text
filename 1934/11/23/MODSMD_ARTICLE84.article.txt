(Sports editor's note: Ever since
Sylvestre J. Drofnats sot slapped in
the hoosegow for carving up his little
brother with a cleaver, he thinks he
is a martyr. So he has written a
soul-stirring ballad: "To Alma Mar
tyr, by the Prisoner of Chiffon,"
which we are publishing, because
that's all we can do.)
My hair is purple
But not with fears,
Nor grew it white in a single night
As men's have grown with sudsy
beers.
I
California's a lovely school,
A lovely school, a lovely school.
Ingram is a lovely fool,
A lovely fool, tra-la.
(Swing your podners)
"Poor Cal" has a lot of profs,
A lot of sophs and apple-sophs.
"Poor Cal" has a lot of dough,
A lot of dough, and a lot of
doughps.
(Cal has Ingram)
Cal has lots of great, big buildings,
Lots of communists* capitalists,
'gildings.
Swelled with pride, they're fit to
burst.
God Bless Hearst, and Hearst, and
Hearst.
(Cal has a football team)
Cal has more of everything.
"Quantity," is what they sing.
"The Farm way down in the
sticks."
But the Farm will beat them 20-6.

(Sports editor's note: Ever since
Sylvestre J. Drofnats sot slapped in
the hoosegow for carving up his little
brother with a cleaver, he thinks he
is a martyr. So he has written a
soul-stirring ballad: "To Alma Mar
tyr, by the Prisoner of Chiffon,"
which we are publishing, because
that's all we can do.)
My hair is purple
But not with fears,
Nor grew it white in a single night
As men's have grown with sudsy
beers.
I
California's a lovely school,
A lovely school, a lovely school.
Ingram is a lovely fool,
A lovely fool, tra-la.
(Swing your podners)
"Poor Cal" has a lot of profs,
A lot of sophs and apple-sophs.
"Poor Cal" has a lot of dough,
A lot of dough, and a lot of
doughps.
(Cal has Ingram)
Cal has lots of great, big buildings,
Lots of communists* capitalists,
'gildings.
Swelled with pride, they're fit to
burst.
God Bless Hearst, and Hearst, and
Hearst.
(Cal has a football team)
Cal has more of everything.
"Quantity," is what they sing.
"The Farm way down in the
sticks."
But the Farm will beat them 20-6.
