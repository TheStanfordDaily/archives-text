# ANALYSIS SHOWS INDIAN TEAM SUPERIOR TO U.C.
## 
### 
By Craig Barbash
Stanford carries into the Big Game
battle tomorrow a line and backfield
reputedly the best on the Pacific
Coast. In a fighting California team
they will find plenty of opportunity
to prove their rating.
Any way you want to look at it—
1 position for position, weapon for
weapon—Stanford is the superior
team as the Bears and Cards enter
1 ; the fortieth annual Big Game.
, Newcomers Start
California will not be the same
| team which gave Stanford a great
battle last year. Five new starters
: change the complexion of the con
j test considerably, and it will mean
' r j a California team not accustomed to
I play together will face a Stanford
squad well moulded into a team unit.
' Bob Reynolds and Claud Calla
; way at tackles for Stanford will be
) faced by two newcomers to the Cal
i Starting lineup, Ray Nordstron and
Dave Anderson. Both the Bears
showed well against U.S.C. and tore
i large holes in the Idaho line. Though
I both are 205-poundcrs, the Califor
| nia men will be outweighed slightly.
Crosby Beedy and Ray Jack arc
| the new California guards, re
placing Tenncy and McAtecr on
(he first string. Woody Adams
and Larry Rouble have the edge
i both in power and experience and
i figure to outcharge the California
pair.
| In the backfield Bob Grayson,
■ Stanford's fullback, appears the out
islanding runner on cither team,
j while "Bones" Hamilton cannot be
denied as the most versatile player—
! blocker, tackier, and runner—of any
| man on the field tomorrow, or on
j most any field.
Arleigh Williams vies with Ham
[ ilton for versatility, and though a
kicker who will give Frank Alustiza
! a battle in distance, the California
I left halfback has not thus far shown
! Hamilton's power.
Mocllcr at Back
Ken Moeller at right half for Cali- j
, fornia may be likened in Ihe work i
i he does to Stanford's Buck Van Del- !
j len. Both are rugged and do much j
! blocking. Moeller carricd the ball
on plays to the left side against Idaho
I and gained considerably, but under
I the stress of "big time" competition
ihe has yet to show Van Dellen's
! consistent ability to advance the ball.
The Brittingham brothers, Bob and
j Jack, are surprise starters at ends
j for the Bears, replacing Jones and
! Meek. Both starters arc hard to j
root out of defensive positions. But
"Monk" Moscrip and Keith Topping
! must be given the ball in an analy
i sis of ability.
At, center Stanford's Wes Mullet
i will outweigh Russ Calkins, the Cal '
1 Starter, about 20 pounds. Calkins |
has been so violent on the defense j
that his occasional poor passes on j
| offensive have been overlooked, j
: Muller charges like a bull backing ;
lup gaps in Ihe defense. He is im- j
proving his diagnosis of plays each j
gaine, and tomorrow will probably |
not be fooled by the offenses, de- j
, layed bucks, or reverses.
FROSIf OUTLOOK GOOD
Prospects for frosh baseball look
better this year than they have for
) f everal seasons past. There are about
115 frosh out for ball already with
several more coming up from foot-]
1 ball.

Stanford carries into the Big Game
battle tomorrow a line and backfield
reputedly the best on the Pacific
Coast. In a fighting California team
they will find plenty of opportunity
to prove their rating.
Any way you want to look at it—
1 position for position, weapon for

team as the Bears and Cards enter
1 ; the fortieth annual Big Game.
