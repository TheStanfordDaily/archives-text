# LIGHT CROWD AT GAME EXPECTED
## Heavy Odds Contribute To Small Ticket Sale 
### 
Fewer spectators and perhaps not
so tight a game as last year. Such
are two of the main prospects of the
big clash tomorrow.
Graduate Manager A1 Masters
yesterday revealed that only be
tween 62,000 and 63,000 tickets have
been disposed of. Last year fully
78,000 grid fans sat in the Stanford
bowl to see the annual classic.
With the last-minute rush for
seats not yet accounted for, it is
j likely that the present 63,000 total
will be boosted considerably, Mas
ters believes. The Berkeley Sta
dium will hold some 78,000 persons.
Stanford rooters are not. holding
back, however, just because the
game is across the bay this year.
Twenty-four hundred Card student
tickets have been sold, Masters said.
The general belief that Stanford
has the stronger team and that she is
likely to score an easy win has been
named as one of the principal rea
sons.
