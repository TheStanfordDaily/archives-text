This writer thoroughly enjoys sticking out his nose and asking for it,
and flat predictions are the best means of accomplishing this. So, in spite
of the hard luck that befell Sylvestre J. Drofnats and his little brother Joe
last week, here goes with a lot of predictions concerning Stanford's little
battle with California Saturday.
We claim:
That Stanford will win the game by two touchdowns or more, and
in so doing, we pray to the high heavens thai it doesn t rain. II the skies
do pour forth, we still like Stanford, but not by that biff a score.
That Stanford will score at least once from somewhere between the
California 30- and 5-yard lines. That is, at least one scoring play will start
with the ball in this territory.
That the Indians will score again, at least once, from within the three
yard line.
That a scorc will be made on a California pass, but not on a Stanford
pass. To clarify: either the Bears will connect with a touchdown pass,
or a Bear pass will be intercepted and converted into points by Stanford.
That each team will attempt at least one field goal, and that one or the
olher will connect.
That Arleigh Williams of the Bears will go through or around Monk
Moscrip once, and only once, for a gain ol eight or more yards.

That Bobby Grayson will score a
touchdown lor Stanford.
That both Grayson and Moscrip
will leave little doubt in the minds
of Big Game witnesses as to their
claim for all-American distinction,
and that both will be standouts all
the way in the Cardinal lineup.
That the California running at
tack will not go for more than a
total of 1(H) yards, and that Stan
ford will total over 200 yards from
scrimmage on running plays.
That Stanford will drive for four
or more consecutive first downs at
least once, and that California will
not make more than two first downs

on any one drive.
That California will not score on
running plays.

That at least two of Frankie Alu.sliza's punts will go out of bounds or
be grounded within Ihe Bear 15-yard line, but
That Williams' kicks will go for a better average in yards than those
of Alustiza.
That Buck Van Dellen will play his best game since the Southern Cali
fornia contest of 1933, and that Van Dellen will really approach his per
formance of that game for the first time since.
That California will attempt 15 or more forward passes, and Stanford
will not try more than eight.
That, if the Cards should score in the first ten minutes of play, the final
count will favor Stanford by 20 points or more.

This writer thoroughly enjoys sticking out his nose and asking for it,
and flat predictions are the best means of accomplishing this. So, in spite
of the hard luck that befell Sylvestre J. Drofnats and his little brother Joe
last week, here goes with a lot of predictions concerning Stanford's little
battle with California Saturday.
We claim:
That Stanford will win the game by two touchdowns or more, and
in so doing, we pray to the high heavens thai it doesn t rain. II the skies
do pour forth, we still like Stanford, but not by that biff a score.
That Stanford will score at least once from somewhere between the
California 30- and 5-yard lines. That is, at least one scoring play will start
with the ball in this territory.
That the Indians will score again, at least once, from within the three
yard line.
That a scorc will be made on a California pass, but not on a Stanford
pass. To clarify: either the Bears will connect with a touchdown pass,
or a Bear pass will be intercepted and converted into points by Stanford.
That each team will attempt at least one field goal, and that one or the
olher will connect.
That Arleigh Williams of the Bears will go through or around Monk
Moscrip once, and only once, for a gain ol eight or more yards.

That Bobby Grayson will score a
touchdown lor Stanford.
That both Grayson and Moscrip
will leave little doubt in the minds
of Big Game witnesses as to their
claim for all-American distinction,
and that both will be standouts all
the way in the Cardinal lineup.
That the California running at
tack will not go for more than a
total of 1(H) yards, and that Stan
ford will total over 200 yards from
scrimmage on running plays.
That Stanford will drive for four
or more consecutive first downs at
least once, and that California will
not make more than two first downs

on any one drive.
That California will not score on
running plays.

That at least two of Frankie Alu.sliza's punts will go out of bounds or
be grounded within Ihe Bear 15-yard line, but
That Williams' kicks will go for a better average in yards than those
of Alustiza.
That Buck Van Dellen will play his best game since the Southern Cali
fornia contest of 1933, and that Van Dellen will really approach his per
formance of that game for the first time since.
That California will attempt 15 or more forward passes, and Stanford
will not try more than eight.
That, if the Cards should score in the first ten minutes of play, the final
count will favor Stanford by 20 points or more.
