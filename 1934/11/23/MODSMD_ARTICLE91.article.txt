# ALL-CONFERENCE TEAM 'PICKERS' ALL SET; STANFORD HAS CHANCE FOR EACH POSITION
## 
### 
All - Coast, all - Conference, and j
other all-star football teams will be ]
selected and splashed all over van- i
ous sports pages during the next few i
weeks, and the various "pickers" i
are already hard at work looking (
over prospects and selecting tenta- |
tive teams.
Among the possibilities, a Stan- ;
ford man is named for nearly every
position, and there looms the strong ,
probability that three or four Car- j
dinal stars will receive mention on j
many teams.
Fates at Stake
Tomorow's Big Game will settle j
Ihe fates of several more doubtful i
Stanford and California players, and j
other games over the week-end will j
help those who formulate the myth- ■
ical teams in determining their final !
choices. Washington's clash with j
Washington State may show up a !
few stars to advantage, and even the j
U.C.L.A.-Oregon State game may j
contribute its bit in the pickings.
Among the centers who have been .
mentioned off and on all season are
Stanford's Wes Muller, Larry Sie- ;
inering of the University of San :
Francisco, and Russ Calkins of Cali- j
l'ornia. Seimering has been leading j
the list of comment, with Muller ap- [
parently a close second. Both are j
riding somewhat on 1933 Feputa- .
lions, but each is contributing his
bit to two of the strongest lines in 1
the Pacific region. Calkins seems a
third choice for most of the authori- j
ties.
The guard positions are the ones
giving the moguls the most diffi
culty. No sensations such as Bill I
Corbus and Rosy Rosenberg of ,
1 !>:!!{ have been noted, and the final
nominations will be made from a
long list of consistently good, but
hardly all-star guards.
Leading in this group are Boyer !
of U.C.L.A., Mucha of Washington, j
Pecheu of San Francisco, Rouble, t
Adams, and Black of Stanford. Until ,
the Stanford-Husky game of two I
weeks ago, Mucha was considered '
almost a unanimous choice, but the i
three Cardinals helped the other
Stanford linemen to halt the huge
Northerner. Mucha still rates a good
chance, but any of Ihe Stanford trio
may break into the figuring. Boyer ,

is a standout in the otherwise fairly
weak Bruin forward wall, and Pe
cheu is just another of the reason
for the Don line's high ranking.
Reynolds Outstanding
Big Bob Reynolds of Stanford and
Barber of San Francisco seem the
outstanding choices for the tackle
positions, wiih Lutz and Boone of
California still claiming a prayer of
recognition, depending on their
game tomorrow, and with Theodo
ratus of Washington State as the
outstanding representative of the
Northwest.
Monk Moscrip of Stanford seems
almost unanimous as an end se
lection, with the other flank post
finding ErdcTatz of St. Mary's,
Arnericb of Santa Clara as the
Brett of Washington State, and
outstanding choices. Stanford's
Keith Topping has an outside
chance at mention in this position.
The backfield positions are over
flowing with their usual number of
highly publicized ball-carriers, and
the powers that do the choosing are
laboring over many possibilities for
these four berths.
Stanford offers three men for con
sideration —Bobby Grayson. Bones
Hamilton, and Frankie Alustiza.
Grayson is a standout choice for
fullback, and Bay Peterson of San
Francisco, Flash Falaschi of Santa
Clara, Norman Franklin of Oregon
State, and others will have to be
content with second- and third
string mention.
Halfbacks are many, with Arleigh
Williams of California as one of the
leading choices, with Hamilton, Burl
Bufkin of Washington, Mike Baccia
rini of San Francisco, A1 Nichelini
and Harry Mattos of St. Mary's, So
brero of Santa Clara, Van Vliet of
Oregon, Oravec of Willamette. Pan
gle of Oregon State, and Christof
ferson of Washington State all claim
ing their backers for the wing posts
on the honorary team.
In ihe quarterback position, God
di.rd of Washington State and Alus
tiza of Stanford claim the chief men
tion. Goddard. second place scorer
in the conference, is given odds to
place oftener than Alustiza. Other
possibilities for this work are Davis
of U.S.C. and Salatino of Santa Clara.
