# PALY CITIZENS BACK STANFORD
## 
### 
With the unanimous support of
prominent Palo Altans behind them,
Stanford's varsity football players
will not lack home-town support in
tomorrow's Big Game. Each one of
nine leading merchants and city of
ficials picked the Indians to win, and
several of them favored Tiny Thorn
hill's men by decisive scores.
The statements of these townsmen
are as follows:
Arnold Rumwell, city attorney—
"The Cardinals will come out on top
by a score of 21 to 6. That's a writ
ten guarantee. I've done a lot of
research on the case, and all evidence
points that way."
J. F. Byxbee, city engineer—"I
predict that Stanford will win 20
to 6."
Firemen Pick Score
William Clemo, head of the fire
department—"Stanford should take
the game by about a 31 to 7 score—
this is from some of the boys."
Howard Zink, chief of police—
"These Big Games are always good.
I like the Indians to win this one.
13 to 0. with two touchdowns and a
conversion. That result would be
satisfactory to me as a Stanford
advocate."
George Stewart, acting principal
of the Palo Aito High School: "The
Cards will triumph by two touch
downs, or 14 points, in what will bo
a better game than most people look
for."
Howard C. "Hod" Ray, football
coach at the high school—"Stanford
should win by a couple of touch
downs in a good game. If it keeps on
raining, I don't know how to predict
it."
Ex-Yell King Talks
Bob Fraser, Stanford's head yell
leader in 1927 —"Tiny's team will
win by at least two touchdowns, and
probably more, but I don't think
they'll copy the 1930 team and ex
ceed the 41 to 6 score that they
rolled up at Berkeley when I was
leading yells."
Ed Crady, Palo Alto merchant—
"Stanford ought to win by about
three scores—probably 20 to 0. Un
less California gets a lucky break,
she won't score."

Cards will triumph by two touch

Howard C. "Hod" Ray, football

Bob Fraser, Stanford's head yell
leader in 1927 —"Tiny's team will
win by at least two touchdowns, and
probably more, but I don't think
they'll copy the 1930 team and ex
ceed the 41 to 6 score that they
rolled up at Berkeley when I was
leading yells."
Ed Crady, Palo Alto merchant—
"Stanford ought to win by about
three scores—probably 20 to 0. Un
less California gets a lucky break,
she won't score."
