# ALUSTIZA GOOD IN '32 CLASSIC
## 
### 
California holds Stanford to a 7-7
tic. Redshirts' offense stopped cold
by seas of mud in the rain-soaked
Memorial Stadium. Hamilton gets
into open twice, but slips once, and
plows into safety man once, fearing
to try dodging. Rouble injured.
Grayson has a bad day of fumbling.
Both teams score on passes. Ham
ilton makes lone Indian score with
but five minutes left in the game.
Moscript converts. Alustiza is most
outstanding player of the day, al
though Adams looks good.
This is not a forecast of the Big
Game for 1934. but the tale of the
1932 Little Big Game when Stan
ford's Laughing Wonders were
freshmen. The starting lineup read
much like that of the Varsity of
today.
Moscrip, Callaway, Rouble, Roth,
Adams, Reynolds, Trompas, Hoop,
Hamilton, and Alustiza composed
the first string. Roth is now out of
school due to scholastic difficulties.
Trompas and Hoos have been
pushed into the second string by
Topping and Van Dellen but still see
action. The other eight men are now
to face California for the third time
as the major part of Stanford's
"greatest" Big Red Machine.
