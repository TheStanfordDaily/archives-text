## Lee Declares Spectators Run Greater Risks Than Players

When the hero of the game is |

leg or an injured back, football |
mothers in the stands shudder, and :
j sports writers beat a hectic tattoo i
on their typewriters.
But if Ihe huzzas of public and
press which go to the fallen giant
were turned instead to celebrating i
the accidents of daily life — the j
drownings, the auto accidents in- j
curred to and from games, the car
diac patients who are hauled from
the stadium, victims of football ex
citement, there wouldn't be ears
enough to hear, or reporters enough
to write the copy.
So believes Russell V. Lee, physi- 1
i cian to the Stanford gridders, who i
has been watching both football and j
! its health records at the Farm long j
enough to convince him that foot- j
ball isn't half as dangerous as the ;
public believes.
Comparing the number of injur'";
on the gridiron with those sustained 1
in other sports reveals some inter
esting and overlooked statistics, ac
cording to his article, "Causes of In- j
I juries on the Football Field," in No
vember's Stanford Illustrated Re
: view.
"Swimming, for instance, is largely
participated in simply as a sport,"
he stated, "yet over 3,000 people will
be drowned this year.
This year will see at least 50,000
; colleges athletes playing football, no
less than half a million high school
; students, and approximately 2,000,-
000 sand-lot, club, professional, and
■ grammar school participants. Of that
, number, only 8 to 40 will be killed.
Brain injuries rank first as the
causes of football death. Infections
run a close second. At Stanford, of
all incapacitating injuries those to
; the knee are most frequent. Clip
ping from behind, now illegal, and
blocking, have been the most fre
[ quent cause of such accidents. In
• ternal injuries, Dr. Lee believes, are
usually caused by a blow by an op
;! ponent's knee in the chest or unpro
-1 j tected abdomen.
' Avoidance of such accidents are
as much a part of Dr. Lee's business

' alumni and helpful students turn
• | with criticism and suggestion, can
1 j and does help.
' I "The greatest responsibility for

' 1 with him," Dr. Lee stated. "If the
' ; coach insists that every athlete re
s ceive a preliminary medical exami
; nation, if he refrains from 'firing up'
