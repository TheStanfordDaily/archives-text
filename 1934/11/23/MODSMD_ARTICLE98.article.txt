# Red Machine Ranked With California Wonder Team
## INDIAN BACKFIELD HAS MORE POWER IN BALL CARRIERS Adams – Rouble Combine, Outclass Bear Guards 
### Mort D'Evelyn 
With a Ro:C Bowl game in their
sophomore year and what looms to I
be an undefeated year and another j
invitation to the Rose, Bowl in their;
junior year, Stanford's present foot- j
ball eleven is being ranked by some |
enthusiasts as the best team ever to !
play on the Coast, which automati- j
caliy takes in the famous wonder j
teams of California in the early |
years of the last decade.
Cal Unbeaten Three Years
Few of the present-day fans real- |
ize just how great a football team j
has to be to surpass the California [
wonder team. For three seasons — j
1920, '21, and '23—the Bears went'
undefeated. In 1920 they licked the j
Big Ten champions, Ohio, in a post- ;
season game. In 1921 they scored!
312 points to their opponents' 33. In j
1922 the strength and reputation ol' |
the Bears was so great that the j
Stanford captain before the Big!
Game was optimistic enough to state j
that the "Big Game will not be a j
track meet," and the Stanford paper j
headed its story "FIGHTING CAR- j
DINALS HOLD BEARS TO FOUR j
TOUCHDOWNS IN BIG GAME" j
after the game.
The Stanford line of 1934 is cer- j
tainly larger than the California |
line of 1921, averaging around 205 I
pounds per man as against 187 :
pounds for the wonder team. The |
difference in playing strength is; j
probably not as great.
Latham Still Famous
At center Cal had Captain '"Fat" '
Latham, whose reputation after a !
lapse of 13 years is still mighty, i
Latham was a bulkwark in the line, j
and could probably outplay any cen- j
ter Stanford can put on the field J
today.
Cal's tackles were Stupe Barnes,
a three-year veteran, and Dan Mc-
Millan, an All-American, who in
cidentally played a year of football
at U.S.C. McMillan's great record is
not enough to rank these two Cal
men ahead of Claude Callaway and
Bob Reynolds, 1934 Indian tackles.
Woody Adams and Larry Rouble.
Stanford's "Five and Ten" guard
combination, s;:em to have a decided |
edge over "Fat" Clark and Lee j
Cranmer of the '21 Cal eleven.
Ends Evenly Matched
The ends of ihe two teams are :
evenly matched. Cal had Brick Mul
ler and Brodies Stephens, the pair [
who still hold the record for the

I longest completed pass in a college
game, 70 yards against Ohio. Monk
Moscrip and Keith Topping rate with
| the Coast's best but cannot be ranked
eabove this wonder team pair.
