# Europe Seeks New Alliances In War Scare
## Little Entente Threatened With Rumored French-Russian Pact STATESMEN NERVOUS France Adds to Armaments, Germany Is Quiet 
### 
(Copyright, 1934, by the A.P.)
LONDON, Nov. 25.—An atmos
phere of warlike excitement pre
vailed in Europe at the beginning of
a new week tonight as nation after
nation joined in the cry, "Who's your
ally?"
In the last few days new shouts of
discord have echoed across the
borders of European nations. Like
chi'dren seeking shelter from an ap
proaching storm, countries big and
small were hunting new security un
der the skirts of alliances with pow
erful neighbors or distantly strate
gic countries.
U.S. Involved
Even the United States figured in
this new phase of world politics
when the question of a new Anglo-
American understanding was re
ported to have been under contem
plation to offset Japan's insistcnl de
mands at the London naval conver
sations for parity in armaments.
Calm counsels in the principal
European capitals continued to be
lieve warfare would be limited to
words and that the Old World would
escape, as it has already narrowly
escaped several times this year, a
repetition of the cataclysm of 1914.
The most alarming rumor of the
week-end was contained in re
ports from Maribor, Yugoslavia,
that the authorities of that nation
had cancelled all military leave at
the northern garrison, adjacent to
both Hungary and Austria.
At Geneva, where immediate in
terest centered in Yugoslavia's ac
cusations against Hungary, growing
out of the recent assassination of
King Alexander, it was hoped that
the resulting Central European bit
terness could be lanced like an ab
scess and healed.
Entente in Danger
Out of a welter of accusations,
plots, and counterplots, new friend
ships and alliances were cutting
across old allegiances, threatening
such established relationships as the
Little Entente, which has been the
politcial backbone of Middle Europe
since the World War.
The most sensational develop
ment of this nature was the reve
lation of Leon Archimbaud.
France's reporter of the budget,
that his country has virtually ob
tained a new and potentially pow
erful ally in Soviet Russia, on
whom France can depend in case
of necessity to harass Germany's
eastern frontiers as she did in tiie
World War.
Many leaders said that if the Cove
nant of the League of Nations is a
"living reality," nations have a right
to bring their grievances to Geneva
for discussion.
Nevertheless, the atmosphere was
one of nervousness increased by re
cent political events, including the
discussion in the French Chamber of
Deputies on German rearmament
and the movement to obtain revision
of post-war treaties.

discussion in the French Chamber of
Deputies on German rearmament
and the movement to obtain revision
of post-war treaties.

LONDON, Nov. 25.—An atmos
phere of warlike excitement pre
vailed in Europe at the beginning of
a new week tonight as nation after
nation joined in the cry, "Who's your
ally?"
In the last few days new shouts of
discord have echoed across the
borders of European nations. Like
chi'dren seeking shelter from an ap
proaching storm, countries big and
small were hunting new security un
der the skirts of alliances with pow
erful neighbors or distantly strate
gic countries.
U.S. Involved
Even the United States figured in
this new phase of world politics
when the question of a new Anglo-
American understanding was re
ported to have been under contem
plation to offset Japan's insistcnl de
mands at the London naval conver
sations for parity in armaments.
Calm counsels in the principal
European capitals continued to be
lieve warfare would be limited to
words and that the Old World would
escape, as it has already narrowly
escaped several times this year, a
repetition of the cataclysm of 1914.
The most alarming rumor of the
week-end was contained in re
ports from Maribor, Yugoslavia,
that the authorities of that nation
had cancelled all military leave at
the northern garrison, adjacent to
both Hungary and Austria.
At Geneva, where immediate in
terest centered in Yugoslavia's ac
cusations against Hungary, growing
out of the recent assassination of
King Alexander, it was hoped that
the resulting Central European bit
terness could be lanced like an ab
scess and healed.
Entente in Danger
Out of a welter of accusations,
plots, and counterplots, new friend
ships and alliances were cutting
across old allegiances, threatening
such established relationships as the
Little Entente, which has been the
politcial backbone of Middle Europe
since the World War.
The most sensational develop
ment of this nature was the reve
lation of Leon Archimbaud.
France's reporter of the budget,
that his country has virtually ob
tained a new and potentially pow
erful ally in Soviet Russia, on
whom France can depend in case
of necessity to harass Germany's
eastern frontiers as she did in tiie
World War.
Many leaders said that if the Cove
nant of the League of Nations is a
"living reality," nations have a right
to bring their grievances to Geneva
for discussion.
Nevertheless, the atmosphere was
one of nervousness increased by re
cent political events, including the
discussion in the French Chamber of
Deputies on German rearmament
and the movement to obtain revision
of post-war treaties.
