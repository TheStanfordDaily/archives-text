# Gaieties Win Praise From Packed House
## Weaver, Copp, Heckscher Outstanding Stars 
### Bud Brill 
A pandemonious paean of applause
surged through the Assembly Hall
last Friday evening as the final cur
tain, drooveling slowly stageward,
closed the last scene of Ram's Head's
glittering, glamorous 1934 Big Game
Gaieties; all of which is a nice way
of saying that the .superlative spec
tacle was "de nuts."
The spirit of tlic Stanford rough,
coming t<Â» the performance with a
pocket full of pennies, was forced
to toss them at scenes far better
than the best of any Gaieties num
ber of the last five years, for this
show had talent, originality, swell
music, and plenty of pep.
The show consisted of Weaver,
Copp, Heckscher, and a cast of 97
able thespians. How we loved
Weaver, how we shouted, for that
insane youth has the rare faculty
of being able to win the plaudits of
an audience. Copp's number, "So
liloquy on a Water Tank," was a
hilarious event for those enjoying
that type of entertainment. It savors
strongly of the Dwight Fiske sort of
thing, that has been wowing Park
Avenue bigwigs (Go East, young
man, go East!). Ernie Hcekscher's
banjo-playing was so good that he
broke Gaieties tradition by being
forced to give an encore. The au
dience simply wouldn't let the show
go on.
Gordon Songs Praised
Mac Gordon starred vicariously
with his songs, "Maybe You Think
I Don't Know," "I'm Writing This
Song to You," and "Hi Ho the Mcr
rio." The number "Major in Love,"
written by him in collaboration with
Margaret Krohn and Anne Ritchie,
was the hit of the evening, and with
proper backing I'd say there was ab
solutely no reason for its not being
"Big-Ten" material. "Words and
Music" by Norman Sears, "When I'm
with Her" by Weaver, and "A Waltz
with You" by Keating, were other
outstanding numbers. Excellent vo
calists, including Ruth Williams, Tro
Harper, Barbara Pat ton, Norman
Sears, Drayton Bryant, Claire Mitch
ell, and AI Treolar were responsible
for putting these numbers across.
The Pi Phi's skit, having to do
with the "Undeserved but Awful
Pate of the Stanford Rough," was
easily the best of the evening.
The Tri Delt Musical Novelty
was another "best" skit; and Dick
Dawson, in a "chalk talk," success
fully coupled a demonstration of un
usual artistic ability with an en
tertaining curtain speech. The Glee
Club's "Schnitzelbank" of old Farm
songs was thoroughly enjoyed and
entered into by the audience. The
chorus, under the direction of Hes
ton Beaudoin, did surprisingly well
for an amateur group, and the few
slips they did make were received
with pleasure by the somewhat
rowdy group of balcony spectators.
Sets. Music Good
One of the best features of the
production was the use of the news
paper theme for continuity (by Gor
don Steedman), instead of having a
master of ceremonies. The drops
and sets, by George Andreini, were
quite colorful and effective, and
William M. Timmons can chalk up a
second successfully directed produc
tion.
