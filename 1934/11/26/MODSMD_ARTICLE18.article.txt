# WIN OR LOSE, FAIR PLAY COMES FIRST

(Editorial)
The l'orlielli annual Big (iame proved more than one
point. Stanford has one of ilie country's best football teams,
admits it, and is proud of the fact. The Indians did a nine
to-seven job with the Bears, and the boys from the Farm
found that it didn't take the first string to do it.
Stanford defeated California, fairly and squarely, and
we might as well stop right there. Hut that would not pre
vent repetition of the shameful and degrading example of
poor sportsmanship that marred an otherwise great day in
Berkeley for some 70,000 roaring, raving fans.
The game, itself a bloody spectacle of sixty minutes,
that saw lists fly and blows register on weary flesh when
otlicials were looking the other way, was scarcely over
before the California rooting section joined in a chant
that has probably only been heard once before in a foot
ball stadium.
That once was last year, when the same California
rooting section delivered the same obnoxious, pornographic
ditty in an unexpurgated version of one of the vilest "songs"
on record. Twelve months ago, the Daily, hoping that the
occurrence might have been accidental and not to be re
peated, said nothing. Today, the Daily asks that the
friendly rivalry that once was California's and Stanford's
be revived, that dirt and tilth be removed from thought as
well as action, that there be no "hate," and that future
relations be clean.
For your own information, the tune above mentioned
answers colloquially to the unkind title "The Cardinals
Be Damned, Bovs . . . The Cardinals Be Damned." The
Daily gladly withholds any further comment and refrains
from including the words and music. Enough that at least
15,000 women, young and old, were forced to listen to such
tripe.
One point is certain. November, 10.'ia, and every twelve
months thereafter, cannot and shall not see a Big (iame
that might leave any taint in the mind of the poor fellow
who brings tho kiddies to see the color, the glory of a clean
amateur performance by two topnotch outfits.
For the rooters, a large-sized dose of good yell leading
and mass psychology is recommended. Varsity ball car
riers who nurse a yen for a sock in the other guy's jaw might
still play a hard, fast contest without the rough stuff that
sometimes goes with it when coaches issue the edict: I J lay
clean or don I play.
