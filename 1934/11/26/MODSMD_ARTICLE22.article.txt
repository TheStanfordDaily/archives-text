# Drofnats Says Big Game Was "Breather"

"Sky-y-y rock-k-ett! Whiskey
wee-wee! S-S-S! Boob! Bass, poop
poop-a-doop." In a shower of flying
sparks and breaking China, Sylves
tre J. "Rose Bose" Drofnats came Hy
ing into the Daily office yesterday.
A broad grin o'erspread his hand
some countenance. A ruddy pic
ture of glowing health he was, he
was. Particularly chic was his
prison haircut, and his clothes made
out of zebra fur.
"Hot dog!" said Drofnats.
"How'd you get out of jail?'' the
glowering sports editor parried.
"They had to let me out," replied
the seer. "I used up all the paper in
writing poetry about Stanford s
breather game, and people started to
complain."
"Whadyamean, a 'breather game".'"
asked the sport editor mans.
"The Cat team had halitosis, and
most of Stanford's first team fainted
away," snapped hack the divine. "I
guessed practically 100 per cent on
my predictions on the Pacific
Coast."
"Whadyamean, 'almost'?"
"Well, T missed on the Pomona-
Occidental game. I said Pomona
would win, but they didn't.
"And 1 guessed that Washington
and Washington State would come
within one point of tieing, and they
raised me one."
"How about your national stand
ing?"
"Well, I missed five, but I guessed
a goodly number right."
"Drofnats," the sports editor said,
*'it looks as if this is your swan
song. Football's over, so you re
washed up."
"Yes," said Drofnats, "but not be
hind the ears."
