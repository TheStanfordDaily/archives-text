# Cards Cinch Rose Bowl Bid With 9-7 Victory Over U.C.
## Stanford Awaits Conference Members' Decision, To Be Given Today GRAYSON BREAKS RIBS Hamilton, Schott Score As Indians Stage Rally 
### Millard Browne 
The town of Berkeley did a lot of
celebrating Saturday night.
California's Golden Bears were a
happy bunch, and Stanford's Indians
furnished as woe-begone an appear
ance as any group of football players
could possibly show.
Yes, it was a sad story from Stan
ford's standpoint as the final gun
sounded on the 40th annual Big
Game before some 65,000 fans in Cal
ifornia Memorial Stadium.
Stanford won the game. !) to 7.
And considering this, it was an
exceedingly ludicrous sight that the
victorious Stanford rooters presented
on leaving the stadium.
The Cardinals were 4 to 1 favor-

jury. He sat in the press box and
watched as bloody a first quarter,
iles, the San Francisco bettors said,
when the game opened, and the In
dians were expected some sort of
decisive victory.
But Stanford hackers were not
peeved at the closcness of the
score. It was the cost of the vic
tory that proved so irksome.
It all started the day before the
game when Monk Moscrip was de
clared definitely out with a leg in
from Stanford's standpoint, as any
in Big Game history.
Scliott Comes Through
First on the Cardinal team that
had not suffered a major injury all
season was Bobby Grayson, who fell
with two broken ribs. Next Keith
Topping was "out cold," and then
came Stan Anderson, sub for Gray
son. And it went on that way.
Moscrip was out, that was a blow
to Stanford. But Monk had the sat
isfaction of sitting in the press box
and seeing the third-string sub for
his position, Cai'l Schott, blast him
self into the select roll of Big Game
heroes.
It was Schott who blocked a kick
in the third quarter to set Cali
fornia back on her heels. It was
Schott who blocked % another Wil
liams punt a few moments later to
set Stanford up in a scoring posi
tion. And it was Schott in the fourth
period who place kicked a field goal
that made even Moscrip green with
envy.
Stanford opened with a bang,
.iiiNt like her old self. Init it did not
last long. The Indians crashed
through early in the first period to
the seven-yard line, from where
Grayson passed.
Ken Moeller of the Bears inter
cepted and halted the only Cardinal |
drive in the first half. Williams j
punted out, and continued to get j
the better of Frank Alustiza in kick- ;
ing as the Cards found themselves j
forced ever back into their own ter- j
ritory.
Bears Threaten
In the second period of play, Stan- i
ford fumbled on her 25, and Cali- !
fornia began threatening. The Bears;
advanced to the 1;) and lost the ball
on downs. Then after a few punt ex
changes, California came to the
Cardinal 22 where the Indian line
held for downs as the half ended.
Most of the Stanford excite
ment took place in the third pe
riod. standing on his own 17, Ar
leigh Williams, the chief Bear
claim to gridiron fame, took a bit
too long to punt and the zealous
Schott got in the way. The hall
rolled to the 11, where the Bears
recovered.
Stanford brought a California punt j
back lo the 35 a few moments later I
and Alustiza's pqss was intercepted.
Williams again tried to punt, and
Schott again draped himself over
the ball, recovering on the 24. Alus
tiza tried one buck tljat netted two
yards.
Then that sensational double
reverse from Ila.y Todd to Frank
Alustiza to Captain Bones Hamil
ton sent the latter around right end
behind perfect interference, and
Bones weaved in and out to a
touchdown. Schott's attempted
conversion failed and the score
was <> to 0.
Stanford, at last looking the same
smooth Stanford of other games this
season, opened another drive a.s the
quarter was ending, from the Bear
40-yard line. Bob Maentz slashed
through for one first down, and
Alustiza added another to the 12 as
the gun sounded. Â»
The Indians were set back to the
15 on the two succeeding plays, and
J Schott place-kicked a field goal to
I make the count 9 to 0.
Cards Take Defensive
| Tiny Thornhill's men settled back
| on the defensive from this point on
| and were constantly driven back.
Toward the middle of the final pe
' riod, Williams threw a pass to Jack
Brittingham lhat gained 40 yards
from the Bear 37 to the Cardinal 23.
i Williams then alternated with A1
Thorell to drive to the 7-yard line
; for a first clown. The Indians yielded
l three more and then held for downs
to permit Alustiza to punt out of
i danger.
Williams then passed to Monty
t Reedy for a three-yard loss, and
followed this with a perfectly exe
cuted toss to Brittingham for the
California touchdown. The pass and
run netted 30 yards for the Bears.
Williams converted to make the
I score 9 to 7, and the game was vir
j tually over.
During the 1933 season, Peter
Young of Bluefield College scored
more touchdowns than any other
college football player. His total was
18. Richard Tinney of Davis and
j Elkins, with 25 conversion points,
I took the record in this department.
