# Cards Cinch Rose Bowl Bid With 9-7 Victory Over U.C.
## Stanford Awaits Conference Members' Decision, To Be Given Today GRAYSON BREAKS RIBS Hamilton, Schott Score As Indians Stage Rally 
### Millard Browne 
The town of Berkeley did a lot of
celebrating Saturday night.
California's Golden Bears were a
happy bunch, and Stanford's Indians
furnished as woe-begone an appear
ance as any group of football players
could possibly show.
Yes, it was a sad story from Stan
ford's standpoint as the final gun
sounded on the 40th annual Big
Game before some 65,000 fans in Cal
ifornia Memorial Stadium.
Stanford won the game. !) to 7.
And considering this, it was an
exceedingly ludicrous sight that the
victorious Stanford rooters presented
on leaving the stadium.
The Cardinals were 4 to 1 favor-

jury. He sat in the press box and
watched as bloody a first quarter,
iles, the San Francisco bettors said,
when the game opened, and the In
dians were expected some sort of
decisive victory.
But Stanford hackers were not
peeved at the closcness of the
score. It was the cost of the vic
tory that proved so irksome.
It all started the day before the
game when Monk Moscrip was de
clared definitely out with a leg in
from Stanford's standpoint, as any
in Big Game history.
Scliott Comes Through
First on the Cardinal team that
had not suffered a major injury all
season was Bobby Grayson, who fell
with two broken ribs. Next Keith
Topping was "out cold," and then
came Stan Anderson, sub for Gray
son. And it went on that way.
Moscrip was out, that was a blow
to Stanford. But Monk had the sat
isfaction of sitting in the press box
and seeing the third-string sub for
his position, Cai'l Schott, blast him
self into the select roll of Big Game
heroes.
It was Schott who blocked a kick
in the third quarter to set Cali
fornia back on her heels. It was
Schott who blocked % another Wil
liams punt a few moments later to
set Stanford up in a scoring posi
tion. And it was Schott in the fourth
period who place kicked a field goal
that made even Moscrip green with
envy.
Stanford opened with a bang,
.iiiNt like her old self. Init it did not
last long. The Indians crashed
through early in the first period to
the seven-yard line, from where
Grayson passed.
