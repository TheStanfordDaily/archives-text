# Who's to Pay For the Second World War?
## 
### 
The Wiir threat to world peace continues;
and the diplomats continue to scurry, rat
like, from conference to conference, arguing,
gesticulating, hegging, promising, in unheed
ed efforts to dam the surging Hood of world
armament- It seems that the old men of
government never learned the lesson of 191 <S;
otherwise, why do they lieumit the madness
to go on? It is certain that the young men
have learned the lesson, where, we know not;
hut they are insistent that rationality, not
hlood and iron, shall conquer.
Europe reeks with tension, while the League
of Nations daily retrogresses to a more futile
status, unahle to police two minor nations,
states of South America, at present engaged
in miniature mortal combat of the one-horse
variety. France and Russia are popularly
believed to have reached a defensive accord;
Mussolini trains his warriors from the cradle;
the madmen of Berlin persist in power; and
the inter-racial struggle in south-central Eu
rope smoulders dangerously.
England, Japan, and the t'nited States are
at loggersheads over the naval ratio; and
while Japan announces the greatest war ap
propriation in ils history, Washington rushes
its project for a battle Meet "second to none."
The young men look on ineomprehensive,
waiting, wondering if it's going to be their
show, or if the Second World War can be
deferred to the generation that conies after.
Many of them ponder the question, "Where's
the money coining from?"
The common plea is "security" at any price,
(iod grant that we all get it. The very ferocity
implied in armed readiness may deter us all,
hut* someday someone may have to make
good the bluIT.
