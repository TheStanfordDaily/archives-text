# Honor Again

In (his agitation to gel rid of useless honor
societies one 11111 st regard willi due charity
(he pi t i I'll I late that awaits the presidents of
such organizations.
Sympathy need not he wasted on the rank
and file members of the honor societies should
dissolution he their fate. They would prob
ably peal forth with loud hosnnnas and go
into the world free men once more, relieved
of the necessity of paying unwelcome dues
and of attending boring meetings, when and
if such meetings are held. Thev would no
longer have to keep up the sham of being an
honorable member of an honor society, an
honor society in which honor is the unknown
factor or the minus quantity.
Of course members of honor societies can
probably withdraw whenever they feel like it.
But the trouble is that I hey went into them
under the illusion that they were being hon
ored and they hate to admit that they have
made a mistake. So they go on year alter year,
paying dues and holding the bear by the tail,
hoping that someone will come along and
turn them loose.
But we started to say something about the
presidents. There is where injustice lies. Are
we to wipe out this honored group of honor
society executives in one fell swoop? These
people are perched on the pinnacle of worldly
achievement. Kvery member of a democratic
society cherishes the laudable ambition of
someday being president of something, it
matters not what. These honor society ex
ecutives have attained that objective. II is not
to be lightly taken away. There must he solace
for their deprivation.
The logical solution, after disbanding all
unworthy honor societies, would be to form
an honor society composed of ex-honor so
ciety presidents. They could all be presidents
then and everybody would be happy. That
would be an honor society to end unworthy
honor societies and thai would be a very line
thing indeed.
