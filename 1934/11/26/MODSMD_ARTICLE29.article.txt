# Don't Park Here
## 
### 
That heaven-sent gift or, more appropri
ately, Roth-inspired improvement, the path
from Eneina to the engineering eorner seems
in danger of being eoinpletelv buried in the
deluge of automobiles that pour into the
parking area there every day. Students who
wish to use it are I'oreed to make devious and
rock-strewn detours through a maze of Fords
and Chevrolets.
However, (lordy Davis, scourge of the
wicked and friend of the righteous, serves
notice that the sanctity of the path will be
preserved. From now on anyone parking on
the new asphalt path will be served with a
tie ket.
Thus the path is made safe for its rightful
userâ€”the long-suffering pedestrian.
