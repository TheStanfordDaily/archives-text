# VIEWING THE NEWS
## WITH PAUL EUGENE HOLDEN 
### CHARLOTTE BURRIDGE 
Primary steps of the street railway strike in Los
Angeles and minor labor flare-ups scattered through
out United States turn discussion of the day's news into
a prediction of the future labor situation.
As Professor of Industrial Management, Paul E.
Holdcn understands the past and present trends in
labor disputes. He believes the still uneasy feeling
on the San Francisco Embarcadero to be a "tremor"
following the labor "quake" of last summer, and
is of the opinion that the Los Angeles strike is just
another instance of the unions' trying to get a
foothold in the notoriously open-shop set-up in
Los Angeles.
The national field holds a greater interest for the
labor specialist.
"I think things are quieting down. It may be just
the calm before a storm, depending on the improve
ment in business conditions and such legislation as
may come out of Congress which convenes the first
of the year.
"There is quite a definite idea that Congress will
legislate in connection with unemployment insurance
and old age pension. I think it would be extremely
unwise to secure legislation on the 30-hour week at
present."
It has four drawbacks, the professor explained:
Increased manufacturing cost that would ensue would
raise prices and substantially retard business. Until
industry consolidates the operating conditions on the
basis of a 40-hour week, further reduction would have
the effect of stimulating introduction of labor-saving
devices and in the end would defeat the original pur
pose of the 30-hour week—to provide more opportunity
for work. There is at present an actual shortage of
skilled labor in some fields; thus reduction of hours
would make production even more difficult. Almost
the entire industrial unemployment at present exists
in the capital goods industries, the greatest part of
which is now operating on a 30-hour week or less.
"It was my impression that the President's
appeal for a six month's labor truce lias not been
totally the motivating reason why the situation
has quieted down," Holdcn said.
"It is rather," he continued, "a result of clarifi
cation of the administration's attitude toward the
National Recovery Act—particularly the famous
7-A section which provides for collective bargain
ing. The administration has made clear now that
their interpretation of collective bargaining did
not mean closed shop in any restricted sense.
"The code for the automobile industry involving
collective bargaining has been extended 90 days to
postpone any strike trouble. By that time the industry
will be more vulnerable as factories will be under the
way with 1935 production and any strike at the first of
the year would be more serious."
Another probable outcome of present labor trends
is entrance of unions into the distribution field. Pro
fessor Holden believes this will be accomplished by a
foothold through chain stores.
"Evidence points," he said, "that the American
Federation of Labor is planning toward unioniza
tion of distribution workers. The distribution
field is thd A. F. of L.'s most fertile source, and the
chain store is the most vulnerable spot."
