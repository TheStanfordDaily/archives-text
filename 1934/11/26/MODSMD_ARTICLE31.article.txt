# "INS" AND THE "OUTS"
## BUSINESS ON THE BANDWAGON—AND WHY 
### CROMPTON BANGS, Jr 
BOSTON, Mass., Nov. 25.—One of the most encour
aging post-election developments is the way business
has been climbing onto the F.R. bandwagon. On first
thought this seems just a little strange, for only a few
weeks before election the anti-New Deal campaign was
at its height; bankers, brokers, and the press were be
ginning to say what they really thought. Now they are
falling over each other in the rush to co-operate with
the President.
The answer is not hard to find. The election left
the Democrats about the only party in office any
where, which means the only one able to repay cam
paign favors. Then business is at last realizing that
Roosevelt is just about the only bulwark against
the growing tide of radicalism—which most col
lege professors and newspapermen could have told
them long ago.
Business knows that the Democrats are practically
certain to be in power until 1940, so there's no use
sinking money in G.O.P. stock. Instead sizeable cash
contributions from large corporations # are now going
to the Democrats; as time goes on they will increase—
especially before the next presidential election. The
givers naturally expect to be repaid in favors and posi
tions: they won't be disappointed.
Thus in a few years a marked change is likely to
come over the Democratic party. Whereas in 1932 it
was the party of the People,.in 1936 or 1940, it is likely
to be the party of Privilege. This is the price of success,
the price of building too well.
Now there is no doubt that so-called radical
movements are on the upgrade. They have no rela
tion to Communism or Russia; they're just backed
by desperate and ambitious Americans. Business
in general, and creditors in particular view them
with increasing alarm. Upton Sinclair, Huey Long
and the Townsend Plan made hundreds of thou
sand.l; of New Deal converts in a few weeks. Per
haps they were unwilling converts, hut it was the
lesser of two evils.
Sinclair got nearly a million votes; Long is run
ning Louisiana and reaching over into Mississippi and
Arkansas, and there seem to be several million people
who believe the Townsend hocus-pocus is going to
give them all $200 a month when they are 60. Ob
viously, Roosevelt is about the only man who can meet
these; movements on their own ground and deal with
them.
So business men are flocking to the New Deal, and
even the United States Chamber of Commerce is pro
posing a plan of industrial co-operation. Fundamental
conditions are certainly encouraging (apologies to
Babson), and all business needed to get started was to
get lid of its jitters. The election may have done this;
if it has Prosperity ought at least to peek around the
corner in appreciation.

sand.l; of New Deal converts in a few weeks. Per
haps they were unwilling converts, hut it was the
lesser of two evils.
Sinclair got nearly a million votes; Long is run
ning Louisiana and reaching over into Mississippi and
Arkansas, and there seem to be several million people
who believe the Townsend hocus-pocus is going to
give them all $200 a month when they are 60. Ob
viously, Roosevelt is about the only man who can meet
these; movements on their own ground and deal with
them.
So business men are flocking to the New Deal, and
even the United States Chamber of Commerce is pro
posing a plan of industrial co-operation. Fundamental
conditions are certainly encouraging (apologies to
Babson), and all business needed to get started was to
get lid of its jitters. The election may have done this;
if it has Prosperity ought at least to peek around the
corner in appreciation.
BOSTON, Mass., Nov. 25.—One of the most encour
aging post-election developments is the way business
has been climbing onto the F.R. bandwagon. On first
thought this seems just a little strange, for only a few
weeks before election the anti-New Deal campaign was
at its height; bankers, brokers, and the press were be
ginning to say what they really thought. Now they are
falling over each other in the rush to co-operate with
the President.
The answer is not hard to find. The election left
the Democrats about the only party in office any
where, which means the only one able to repay cam
paign favors. Then business is at last realizing that
Roosevelt is just about the only bulwark against
the growing tide of radicalism—which most col
lege professors and newspapermen could have told
them long ago.
Business knows that the Democrats are practically
certain to be in power until 1940, so there's no use
sinking money in G.O.P. stock. Instead sizeable cash
contributions from large corporations # are now going
to the Democrats; as time goes on they will increase—
especially before the next presidential election. The
givers naturally expect to be repaid in favors and posi
tions: they won't be disappointed.
Thus in a few years a marked change is likely to
come over the Democratic party. Whereas in 1932 it
was the party of the People,.in 1936 or 1940, it is likely
to be the party of Privilege. This is the price of success,
the price of building too well.
Now there is no doubt that so-called radical
movements are on the upgrade. They have no rela
tion to Communism or Russia; they're just backed
by desperate and ambitious Americans. Business
in general, and creditors in particular view them
with increasing alarm. Upton Sinclair, Huey Long
and the Townsend Plan made hundreds of thou
sand.l; of New Deal converts in a few weeks. Per
haps they were unwilling converts, hut it was the
lesser of two evils.
