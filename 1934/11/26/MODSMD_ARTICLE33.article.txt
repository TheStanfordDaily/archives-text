Gene Stratton - Porter's poignant
Limberlost tale is filmed at last, and,
if you liked the story, you will like
the picture. The movie is a well
done, thoughtful, deep research into

a girl's heart and
s u ccessf ully
catches the deli
cate touch of
Stratton - Por
ter's original.
Louise Dresser
is very convinc
ing as the moth-

er of Lenora Comstock, while Ralph
Morgan gives an excellent portrayal
of her helping friend. Marian Marsh,
the shy, wide-eyed Limberlost girl,
convinces a sophisticated audience
that sweetness is not to be scoffed at.

"ONE EXCITING ADVENTURE"
Also at. the Varsity
Beautiful, pert, sophislicated —
Binnie Barnes was an inspired choice
for the cosmopolitan jewel snatcher,
who calmly and sweetly removed
glittering diamond earrings and
platinum watches from jewelers'
velvet containers and rotund de
tectives' pockets.
An able supporting cast, including
Neil Hamilton, Eugene Pallelte, and
Grant Mitchell, aided Binnie Barnes
in achieving smart, casual, delight
fully humorous effects, but from be
ginning to end it was her show—
with no regrets by the audience.
