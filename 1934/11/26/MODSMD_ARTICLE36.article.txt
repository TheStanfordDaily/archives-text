# BULL SESSION
## THE 						GAIETIES: NOT GAUDY BUT NICE 
### 
Stanford audiences have a sup
pressed desire to be on the stage,
the whole pack at once. And the
Gaieties of 1934 gave that chance.
It was not only the roughs and their

pennies. It was
not only a slightly
tipsy electrician in
the booth. It was
not only A1 Roth &
Co. singing from
the floor. But ev
erybody — simul
taneously. Would
they join with
Weaver in "Nuts to
Cal"? Of course!

Would they hop on the wagon with ;
"Son of a Gamboleer"? They did! J
That made the Gaieties hum.
As anticipated, Weaver and Copp
were the heart of the show. When- !
ever there was chance for a lag, [
Weaver could jump in with music j
and a funny pan; or Copp could j
start gurgling about scrambled eggs \
and pools of blood. It worked.
Despite the presence in the cast ;
of the Ancient and Venerable!
Cuckoo Dodderer, there was a de- I
cidod absence of genuinely funny i
lines. A number of rather good |
-mechanical gags partially made up
for the lack. Weaver pulling him
self by the neck, the three hermits. ;
and Storey's flicker thriller clicked.
Songs were good, especially the j
Ritchie - Krohn - Gordon "Major in
Love." By the time she had finished |
"Maybe You Think I Don't Know," (

no one had any doubt but that
Barbara Patton knew. Still, there
was not a hit that would set the
audience on its collective ear. like
the now dimly remembered "You
Don't Know What Heaven Is Like
Till You've Been Kissed by a Red
headed Girl," or Weaver's '33 "You
Look Like a Butcher to Me."
Now that chorus. Choruses arc
ticklish subjects, but they cannot be
neglected. Among the nice copper
pennies that drifted down from the
galleries for the noble dozen women,
stage hands were able to detect not
a few lead slugs, which was appro
priate. But the chorus was as good
as any Stanford chorus: no one ex
pects Stanford women to kick in
time. Their closing number was
well done. Yet throughout, the
chorines suffered from the poor sup
pox-t of the lights: they were not
shaded softly, but glared bright and
white to make the girls seem
stranded.
The Pi Phi skit rightfully took
the cake. Well planned, well tuned,
clevei*, it ran off without a noticeable
hitch. The audience felt that the
"U.C.L.A. Transfer" was an excel
lent addition to the campus.
Not the "Cleverest Yet" as the
ads said, 1934's Gaieties satisfied.
That is a real achievement.

of the Ancient and Venerable!
Cuckoo Dodderer, there was a de- I
cidod absence of genuinely funny i
lines. A number of rather good |
-mechanical gags partially made up
for the lack. Weaver pulling him
self by the neck, the three hermits. ;
and Storey's flicker thriller clicked.
Songs were good, especially the j
Ritchie - Krohn - Gordon "Major in
Love." By the time she had finished |
"Maybe You Think I Don't Know," (

no one had any doubt but that
Barbara Patton knew. Still, there
was not a hit that would set the
audience on its collective ear. like
the now dimly remembered "You
Don't Know What Heaven Is Like
Till You've Been Kissed by a Red
headed Girl," or Weaver's '33 "You
Look Like a Butcher to Me."
Now that chorus. Choruses arc
ticklish subjects, but they cannot be
neglected. Among the nice copper
pennies that drifted down from the
galleries for the noble dozen women,
stage hands were able to detect not
a few lead slugs, which was appro
priate. But the chorus was as good
as any Stanford chorus: no one ex
pects Stanford women to kick in
time. Their closing number was
well done. Yet throughout, the
chorines suffered from the poor sup
pox-t of the lights: they were not
shaded softly, but glared bright and
white to make the girls seem
stranded.
The Pi Phi skit rightfully took
the cake. Well planned, well tuned,
clevei*, it ran off without a noticeable
hitch. The audience felt that the
"U.C.L.A. Transfer" was an excel
lent addition to the campus.
Not the "Cleverest Yet" as the
ads said, 1934's Gaieties satisfied.
That is a real achievement.
—Dave Mcllinkoff.

Stanford audiences have a sup
pressed desire to be on the stage,
the whole pack at once. And the
Gaieties of 1934 gave that chance.
It was not only the roughs and their

pennies. It was
not only a slightly
tipsy electrician in
the booth. It was
not only A1 Roth &
Co. singing from
the floor. But ev
erybody — simul
taneously. Would
they join with
Weaver in "Nuts to
Cal"? Of course!

Would they hop on the wagon with ;
"Son of a Gamboleer"? They did! J
That made the Gaieties hum.
As anticipated, Weaver and Copp
were the heart of the show. When- !
ever there was chance for a lag, [
Weaver could jump in with music j
and a funny pan; or Copp could j
start gurgling about scrambled eggs \
and pools of blood. It worked.
