## California 5-3 Aquatic Win At Berkeley First In Teams' Rivalry 
### Roger Kimball 
Twenty-one straight years of
Stanford victories finally came to an
end when the California varsity
water polo team defeated the In
dians by a score of 5 to 3, Saturday
morning in Berkeley. This set-back
also broke Stanford's string of 28
games with the Bears, in which the
Cardinal paddlers won every time.
Kntire Team Shines
California's great aquatic outfit,
known to have line teamwork, also
proved that it included star players
who would do credit to any team.
Danny Kuhns, ace Bear forward,
scored twice and played a superb all
around game. Captain "Wink" Davis,
Jack Dozier, and Weldon Smith made
the three other goals, and the entire
team outplayed the Cards, who were
not. at their best.
California gained control tff the
ball in the first minute of Saturday'.-;
contest, giving a hint of her success
ful campaign to maintain the up
per hand throughout the game. Be
fore the tilt was two minutes old,
Captain Davis made a beautiful shot
from the side to give the Bears their
initial lead, which Stanford never
took from them.
Bob Haslacher, Card goalie, made
some nice stops in the early stages,
but the Golden Boars' shots were
bullet-like and often beyond his
reach. Kuhns followed Davis with
another clever shot to make the
score 2 to 0. Stanford appeared al
most helpless on offense against the
inspired California team. Weldon
Smith, Bear center-back, made the
third goal, during a siege of rough,
wild play.
Cards Score
With the first half almost over,
Captain Leo Cook put the Cards on
the scoreboard with a fast, short
goal. After several stray shots by
both teams, Bob Foster sank another
one for Stanford, to pull the cham
pion Indians up to within one goal
of the Bears. Shortly after that, the
Card forward left the game because
of rough playing. The half-time in
termission found the score still 3 to 2.
Keeping control of' the competi
tion in the second half, California
soon scored again on an unstoppable
20-footer by Dozier. Fighting for the
ball became fierce as Kuhns made
his second goal a minute later. Sev
eral minutes passed with neither
team able to break through the oth
ers' defense for a score. Bill Wood
ard made Stanford's third and final
goal with only 50 seconds of play
remaining, and the Bears kept the
upper hand until the end.
The Bears were so pleased with
their triumph that they nearly
drowned A1 Dowden, their coach,
who was thrown in and ducked,
though fully dressed. Kuhns, Dav
is, Smith, Dozier. and Goalie Bill
Johnson all played top-notch
games, and Lawrence and Mc-
Chire were not far behind them.
Captain Cook. Wiget, and Wood
ard looked best for the Indians
in defeat.
Tomorrow's game will follow the
Stanford-California frosh tilt, which
will start at 3 o'clock. Admission
will be 25 cents with student body
cards, and 40 cents for the general
public.

proved that it included star players
who would do credit to any team.
Danny Kuhns, ace Bear forward,
scored twice and played a superb all
around game. Captain "Wink" Davis,
Jack Dozier, and Weldon Smith made
the three other goals, and the entire
team outplayed the Cards, who were
not. at their best.
California gained control tff the
ball in the first minute of Saturday'.-;
contest, giving a hint of her success
ful campaign to maintain the up
per hand throughout the game. Be
fore the tilt was two minutes old,
Captain Davis made a beautiful shot
from the side to give the Bears their
initial lead, which Stanford never
took from them.
Bob Haslacher, Card goalie, made
some nice stops in the early stages,
but the Golden Boars' shots were
bullet-like and often beyond his
reach. Kuhns followed Davis with
another clever shot to make the
score 2 to 0. Stanford appeared al
most helpless on offense against the
inspired California team. Weldon
Smith, Bear center-back, made the
third goal, during a siege of rough,
wild play.
Cards Score
With the first half almost over,
Captain Leo Cook put the Cards on
the scoreboard with a fast, short
goal. After several stray shots by
both teams, Bob Foster sank another
one for Stanford, to pull the cham
pion Indians up to within one goal
of the Bears. Shortly after that, the
Card forward left the game because
of rough playing. The half-time in
termission found the score still 3 to 2.
Keeping control of' the competi
tion in the second half, California
soon scored again on an unstoppable
20-footer by Dozier. Fighting for the
ball became fierce as Kuhns made
his second goal a minute later. Sev
eral minutes passed with neither
team able to break through the oth
ers' defense for a score. Bill Wood
ard made Stanford's third and final
goal with only 50 seconds of play
remaining, and the Bears kept the
upper hand until the end.
The Bears were so pleased with
their triumph that they nearly
drowned A1 Dowden, their coach,
who was thrown in and ducked,
though fully dressed. Kuhns, Dav
is, Smith, Dozier. and Goalie Bill
Johnson all played top-notch
games, and Lawrence and Mc-
Chire were not far behind them.
Captain Cook. Wiget, and Wood
ard looked best for the Indians
in defeat.
