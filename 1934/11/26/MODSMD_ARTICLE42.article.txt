# Columbia Holds Broncs To 12-6 Score in North
## 
### 
PORTLAND, Ore., Nov. 25 (TP).â€”A
fighting, inspired Columbia Univer- |
sity football team almost pulled the ,
biggest upset of this weird season,
but bowed 12 to (! to Santa Clara I
here today.
On the sticky, wet field the Santa
Clara Broncos became plodding \
workhorses who by sheer weight:
pushed over two touchdowns after j
being held scoreless all but the last
few seconds of the first half.
So determined was the Columbia !
defense that Santa Clara showed a I
net loss of two yards the first quur
ter, during which neither team made
a first down.
