# CARD SOCCERMEN LOSE TO BEARS BY SCORE OF 4 TO 0
## 
### John McClelland 
Playing one of their best defensive
games of the year but lacking the
necessary spark in the forward line,
Stanford soccermen were again vic
tims of the Golden Bear Saturday
morning by a score of 4-0.
The victorious California squad,
though playing on its own grounds,
didn't look as good as it did in its
first win last Wednesday. The Bears
managed to repulse all of the In
dians' attacks, but their offense was
ragged and three of the scores came
on "breaks."
Indian Defense Strong
The Cards played a hard, fast
game, and were led during every
minute of play by Waddy White,
captain and mainstay of the team
throughout the season. White, at
center half, was forced to spend most
of his time on defense, and was the
thorn in the side of every ambitious
Bear forward.
â€¢
On four rear line Indian defense
men was placed the biggest re
sponsibility from the opening
whistle, and to them goes the
credit for the outstanding team
work of the day. Barney Vier
ling, stocky left back, time and
again got the hall out of scoring
territory with long kicks toward
the Cal goal. Primo Pinotti, sub
stitute goalie, rose to the occa
sion and earned credit for himself
with repeated good saves.
Dick Bullis, right back, though
suffering from a knee injury, broke
up many Bear attacks, and Bud Wil
son, who went into Bullis' position
later in the game, turned in an un
usually fine performance.
Cards Start Well
Until late in the second quarter,
it looked as if Stanford was going
to be able at least to hold their op
ponents even. Then a score came
when a long shot bounded off a Card
player into the net. A little later the
Bears scored again as a long, wild
shot scraped into the corner of the
goal.
In the second half the play was
mostly in' the center of the field,
except on two occasions when the
Bruins scored from close range.

Winning two games each from
California and Southern California
and losing twice to Stanford by one
point margins, U.C.L.A.'s water polo
team finished its season last week
in second place in conference stand
ings.
