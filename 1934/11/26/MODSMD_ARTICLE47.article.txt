IT'S TOSS-UP FOR
HERO HONORS
There are always Big Game heroes and Big Game goats, and Stanford
possesses a couple of the former. There was not the usual clear-cut hero
of the game, but something resembling a tie among three or four Cardinal
players.
Up from the ranks of the third string, Carl Schott, end, made a
totally unexpected showing. He was directly and indirectly respon
sible for both Stanford scores. Schott blocked two kicks in as clean
a manner as any on the Coast this year, and those kicks were from the
foot of Arleigh Williams, usually a very speedy punter. Then Schott
hooted the field goal that made the score !) to ft and proved the margin
of victory.
Schott was the scoring hero, but he had assistance, much of it from a
few other Indians. There was Keith Topping, playing by far his best
game of the season, and consistently holding up the right end of the line.
If it were not for the fact that he has already been a Big Game hero,
Stan Anderson might have been thusly dubbed. Stan showed more real
drive and spunk than any other member of the Stanford backfield, and
he played much of the game with a bandage on his head. He met up with
the wrong kind of company twice and was "out" for a few minutes each
time, but arose and went on with his consistent punching.
Once, however, Anderson was so badly hurt in the first half that he
bad to leave the game, and what did Thornhill do but put in Ray
Todd, third string aide to Bobby Grayson at fullback. Todd had not
played in any game all year, and the bleacherites were just a bit
dubious. The blonde pile-driver matched the play of both Anderson
and Grayson and figured strongly in the one Indian touchdown drive.
! THEY'RE NOT
THE ONLY O.NES
They were not the only Stanford men who played football, but they were
the unexpected ones.
Buck Van Dellen made the safety department appear really safe, and
returned punts nicely. His twin at left half, Bob Maentz, also contributed
some snappy running and blocking.
I Then Captain Bones Hamilton, although he tired himself out running
I to the sidelines to confer with Thornhill on the advisability of sending in
such and such a fourth stringer to replace so-and-so who was injured, was
his old blocking self and added a few yards, not to mention a touchdown
j by carrying the oval.
That touchdown play of Hamilton's, by the way, together with Cali
fornia's scoring pass, were the only really smooth plays this writer saw
i during the entire game. *■
Hamilton scored on a double reverse from Todd to Frank Alustiza
to Hamilton, one of the oldest plays in the Pop Warner ensemble. As
(he play started many would have bet their last tent it would go for
a touchdown, even though it began 22 yards from the goal. Every

HERO HONORS
There are always Big Game heroes and Big Game goats, and Stanford
possesses a couple of the former. There was not the usual clear-cut hero
of the game, but something resembling a tie among three or four Cardinal
players.
Up from the ranks of the third string, Carl Schott, end, made a
totally unexpected showing. He was directly and indirectly respon
sible for both Stanford scores. Schott blocked two kicks in as clean
a manner as any on the Coast this year, and those kicks were from the
foot of Arleigh Williams, usually a very speedy punter. Then Schott
hooted the field goal that made the score !) to ft and proved the margin
of victory.
Schott was the scoring hero, but he had assistance, much of it from a
few other Indians. There was Keith Topping, playing by far his best
game of the season, and consistently holding up the right end of the line.
If it were not for the fact that he has already been a Big Game hero,
Stan Anderson might have been thusly dubbed. Stan showed more real
drive and spunk than any other member of the Stanford backfield, and
he played much of the game with a bandage on his head. He met up with
the wrong kind of company twice and was "out" for a few minutes each
time, but arose and went on with his consistent punching.
