Weather Blustery
Though not accustomed to the
blustery weather of late November
in the Bay Region, Jones performed
magnificently and left little doubt
in the minds of the gallery that he
was still the king of American golf
though he has not played in a major
tournament since his "Grand Slam"
of golf in 1930.
The match between the two
teams was submerged beneath the
elegance of the golf that was
played. Lawson Little played a
greatly improved game over his
last match but still fell four
strokes short of Jonees' sub par 70.
Jones' match partner. Stuart Haw
ley, also scored a 74 while Ernie
pieper had a 73.
The gallery was attracted by the
smoothness of Jones' game, each
stroke having the same mechanical
precision.
Drives Equal
Possibly the most spectacular.shot
of the day was made by Jones on
the third hole where he holed a
birdie on an explosion shot out of a
trap to the right of the green. The
drives of the foursome were just
about equal, though Little had a
slight edge. In the eighteen holes
drives in the rought, and generally
the four were pretty much together.
