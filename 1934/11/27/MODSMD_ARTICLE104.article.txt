"Whether you go to church next |
Thursday, participate in a family re- j
union, see or indulge in some sport, I
eat a sumptuous Thanksgiving din- !
ner, or all of them, you may be sure i
that you are doing something that is I
in perfect keeping with the history,
the tradition, and the .spirit of our j
American Thanksgiving." This Pro- j
fessor Maxwell Savelle, an authority j
on American Colonial history, told !
his radio audience over station KGO !
during the Stanford hour last night, i
Professor Savelle traced the origin
of "our American Thanksgiving" to i
the old English "harvest home," ■
which the Pilgrims brought from |
England, but pointed out t'hat the i
turkey, symbol supreme of the j
American Thanksgiving, is an Amer- J
ican bird.
Savelle also stressed the fact that
Indian corn is an American plant, i
given to the Pilgrims by the Indians j
to enable them to make bread; and j
that the Indian himself, an import
ant figure at the first Thanksgiving, I
is distinctively American.
