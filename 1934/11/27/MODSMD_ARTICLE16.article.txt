# Bay Region Responds To Daily's Editorial
## Dirty Singing Condemned By Student Leaders; Christie Speaks 
### 
Yesterday's front page editorial
charging California with dirty play
ing and dirty singing at the Big
Game re-echoed throughout the Bay
Region last night and this morning
as San Francisco papers headlined
the Daily's comments.
In his blue Monday edit, Editor
Walt Christie, Jr., of the Daily Cali
fornian, substantiated the Daily
charge of pornographic singing, in
an editorial which appeared simul
taneously.
Bears Condemned
"Aside from the Bear rooting sec
tion's unsportsmanlike and hoodlum
sounding shrieking of 'The Cardi
nals Be Damned' after the game,
which might easily be construed
that California has a bunch of poor
sports who don't know how to take
it, the spirit was friendly."
The Californian did not mention
the subject of dirty playing, but
criticized California Coach Bill In
gram, saying:
"Don't tell newspaper reporters in
midsummer that you intend to play
in the Rose Bowl January 1. Don't,
ill short, stick your neck out—and
you will find that things on this
funny old campus will click along in
smooth style."
Kahn's Comment
On the Stanford campus the Daily
editorial was commented on in state
ments by A.S.S.U. President Marvie
Kahn, and Yell Leader Jim Triolo.
Both stated that they didn't notice
any dirty playing but saw a "rough,
tough football game."
Kahn criticized the rooting section,
and said, "The rooting section sur
prised me. I talked to a rally of Cal
students the day before, and they
were very courteous to me."
Triolo didn't hear the singing of
"The Cardinals Be Damned" be
cause he was busy chasing off Stan
l'ordites standing on Andy Smith's
memorial bench. "I didn't hear any
thing to compare with last year.
They were terrible then. I think
they might be complimented on their
improvement."
