# Show Makes $350 Profit
## 
### 
Playing to one of the best ho'uses
in recent years, 1650 people, the
1934 Big Game Gaieties made a profit
of approximately $350, part of which
will make up the deficit of the last
show. Considering the loss incurred
from the Gaieties the last time Big
Game was played in Berkeley, this
year's crowd was an unusually good
one.
According to Ben Cave, about 160
couples attended the post-Gaieties
dance held in Roble Gymnasium,
bringing in a total of $80.
Ram's Head placques for the best
skits of the evening were awarded to
Pi Beta Phi and Phi Kappa Sigma.
Dick Dawson, with his "chalk talk,"
won the award for the Phi Kap's
and "The Undeserved but Awful
Fate of the Stanford Rough" brought
the prize to the Pi Phi's.
