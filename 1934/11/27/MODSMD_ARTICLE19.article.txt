# ASSU Heads To Consider Honor Clubs
## Kahn Favors Continuance Of Honoraries 
### 
Are all honor societies worth
keeping yn the campus, or should
Ex Committee abolish those that do
not seem to serve a definite purpose?
That question may be answered
when the Ex Committee meets to
night in its usual Old Union com
mittee room at 7:15 o'clock.
The honor society problem, which
was rankling the breasts of the Con
stitutional Revision Comrditteemen
last year, has been brought up again.
Many Honor Groups
There are many honor societies
at Stanford. Some of them are con
sidered useful by students; others
charge dues, which few members
pay, get their pictures in the Quad,
and do nothing else.
A.S.S.U. President Marvie Kahn
thinks that Ex Committee .should
not interfere with the honor society
set-up. He says: "I, personally, am
not in favor of abolishing honor so
cieties. 1 believe it is up to the
honor society itself. If the members
want to spend their money and get
their pictures in the Quad, and as
long as the society is not doing any
harm and satisfies the ego of the
members, it's O.K. with me. The
University will kick them out if they
are immoral."
Conflicting Views
Members of campus honorary so
cieties approached by The Daily last
night expressed conflicting views.
Many members refused to be quoted
but said they disliked the honor so
cieties of which they were members.
Campus members who would talk
said the following things:
Gordon Steedman: "Most honor
societies are existing for nothing
more than keeping their name going.
There is a lot of glamour on the out
side, but a lot of dues inside. There
are a few that fill a definite de
mand. All ihe others do is to satisfy
a little political prestige."
Van Dellen Statement
Buck Van Dellen: "I think honor
societies would be all right if they
served some purpose but, as they are
now, they do not."
Gordon Mallatratt: "Honor so
cieties have a definite place in Uni
versity activities; at present, on our
campus this position is highly su
perficial and obscure. Unless the
Stanford honor societies can assume
their burden of purposeful activity
they will continue to fall into a
stagnan condition and eventually
disintegrate."
