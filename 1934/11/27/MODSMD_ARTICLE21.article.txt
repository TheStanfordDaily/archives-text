# Roble Women Get First Lists of Pan Hell Rules
## Greek Goddess 
### BARBARA SWEET 
Roble women, wide-eyed and ea
ger, received their first inkling of
the mysterious glories that are Greek
when copies of the Panhellenic Bid
ding Contract and the Panhellenic
Constitution and By - laws were
passed out to thorn last night during
corridor meetings. The occasion was
the announcement of fall rushing
teas for freshmen, to be held De
cember G, 7, and 8, following the
Thanksgiving vacation.
Warned in sufficient time, fresh
man women will spend the next
two weeks in a frenzy of permanents,
manicures, and prinking, while with
in the sacred portals it is likely that
the Greeks will be engaged in simi
lar pursuits. Lengthy bull (or cow)
sessions will probably keep both
Row and Roble awake far, far into
the night, and another rushing sea
son will be under way.
Or such has been the experience
of rushing in the past, but indica
tions are that this year a saner view
will be taken of the situation. It is
in an effort to transform the Roble
"cow" sessions into sober discus-

sions and the prinking into mere grooming that the freshmen have been
given instructions so far in udvuncc of the teas.
