# New York Police Brutal, Claims Chicagoan Head
## 
### 
CHICAGO, Nov. 26 (/P). â€” New i
York's new policy of "mussing up" j
known criminals when they are ar- j
rested, announced today by Police j
Commissioner Lewis J. Valentine, j
sounded dangerous to Frank E. |
Loesch, veteran head of the Chicago j
crime commission.
"I suppose he is going on the the- :
ory that violence is the only law i
such criminals know," said Loesch. >
"The difficulty with the policy is, j
however, it's likely to be abused. It
i.; likely to brutalize the police."
