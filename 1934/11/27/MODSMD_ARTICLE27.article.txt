# CONTINUANCE OF PYRE PROBABLE
## Big Game Bonfire Incites Praise on Campus 
### 
I As the general consensus of opin
' ion concedes that last week's Big
! Game bonfire was a success, future
similar bonfires become not only a
probability, but practically a cer
tainty.
Those contacted last night unani-
I mously agree that a bonfire under
| the "one day" system carries all the
former meaning with much greater
I efficiency, at the same time inciting
less bad spirit among persons liv
ing in the surrounding community.
Itoth Offers Praise
"The present plan of limiting the
construction to one day and reduc
! ing the size was a very sensible idea,"
i says Comptroller Almon E. Roth.
He adds that under this plan those
people needing wood will not be
i deprived of it by over-zealous stu
j dents.
According to Dean of Men G. B.
I Culver this year's bonfire meant
i just as much as any other bonfire
j and at the same time made it more
! of an all-University affair by having
, others than just freshmen build it.
i He remarks further that no com
! plaints of marauding have been made
• by surrounding citizens. This in it-
J self was one of the main features of
i the old time "ten day" bonfires.
"I think that the bonfire under the
now system carries the same-idea as
{ before — r on a larger scale," says
I the bonfire was larger, but that the
| A.S.S.U. president Marvin Kahn.
I "By 'larger scale' I don't mean that
I good feeling and spirit was main
tained on a larger scale, with a
j greater social contact. I am defi
| nitely not in favor of the old system
| as long as the fire can be built in
one day."
Favors Continuance
Bob Jones, head of this year's
bonfire comirp *ee, states: "I am defi
nitely in jvor of the continuation
of the Big Game bonfire as an an
nual event. The cost, slightly over
one hundred dollars, is practically
I the same as that of putting on card
j stunts between the halves at the
| game. In my opinion the bonfire is
I equally as important if not more
1 so than the stunts, since it leads to
| a greater pre-game spirit and at the
! same time gives us desirable pub
j licity by bringing big crowds to
j watch the burning pyre."
