# Chappie Funnymen Work On Santy Claus Number
## 
### 
Over Thanksgiving vacation while
Chappie men are talking turkey, they
will be thinking up savory quips
with which to pound the stuffing out
of their typewriters, for December 3
is the deadline for the Christmas
number.
Santy Claus and his North Pole
cat will be the subject of the Chappie
hearties.
