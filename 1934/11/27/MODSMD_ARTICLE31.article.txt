# CARD GRID MEN OFFICIALLY BID TO ROSE BOWL
## New Year's, 1935, Will See Fifth Stanford Team At Pasadena ALABAMA MAY BE FOE Eastern Opponent Will Be Chosen Thursday 
### 
Stanford University has been offi
| cially invited to represent the West
! in the annual Tournament of Roses
i football game on New Year's Day at
j Pasadena.
This announcement was made by
;A1 Masters, graduate manager of
I the Board of Athletic Control, late
j yesterday and comes as a climax
; to one of the most successful grid
' iron seasons in Cardinal history,
j After the victory over California it
| was generally assumed that the In
i dian eleven would be selected for
the intersectional contest, but every
j one was awaiting the official invita-
I tion of the Pacific Coast Conference
j committee, which arrived yesterday.
Four Previous Games
j The Tournament of Hoses was
i originated in 1916 and teams rep re
| senting Leland Stanford University
; have played there four times, al
j though Stanford's first New Year's
j Day game was with Michigan prior
;to 1916. This will mak. the fifth
! appearance of Cardinal teams and
j places them as the only western
j gridiron team that has been twice
selected for two consecutive years
to play in the Bowl classic. The
Indians received the bid in 1927 and
1928.
In 1!) games played, the West
holds the small margin of nine
games won to the East's seven,
with three ties. Th<- Indians lost
to Notre Dame 27-10 in 1925, were
I tied by Alabama 7-7 in 1927, de
! fcaled Pittsburgh 7-6 in 1928, and
lost 7-0 to Columbia in 1933.
Although the invitation rests with
the 8.A.C., no action will be taken
until the outcome of Thursday's
games is known. The East winds up
its season on Thanksgiving Day and
in the event that a suitable oppo
nent cannot be found it is not un
likely that Stanford will refuse the
invitation.
Minnesota Declines
Minnesota, classed as the besJt team
| in the East, has asked that the West
j refrain from offering them the Rose
: Bowl bid to save the Gophers the
embarrassment of having to refuse
to come out.
Alabama, the strongest team in the
South, plays Vanderbilt this Thurs
day and it is possible that the Tide
will be upset. Pittsburgh is also a
powerful contender. Masters an
nounced that nothing would be done
in regard to the invitation until the
| results of Thursday's games have
I been determined.
