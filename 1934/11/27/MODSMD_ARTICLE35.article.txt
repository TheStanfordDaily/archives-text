# Unfortunate Situation, That Can Be Cleared Up
## 
### 
liav Region newspapers, with their accus
tomed distortion of facts and headlines, plas
lered Northern California yesterday with the
fact that the Daily did not approve of many
lliings. California sportsmanship in particu
lar. The mailer should possibly be dropped
right there, with the understanding that next
year student officials of both institutions
should make i! their responsibility to elimi
nate a repetition ot the Herkcley liaseo.
A spokesman for the California student
body, A.S.I'.C. president Alden Smith, in a
judiciously disingenuous statement last night,
forestalls this apparent conclusion.
Smith, misquoting Marvie Kalin, A.S.S.I'.
president, publicly announces that, according
to the latter, Stanford was very pleased with
California's good sportsmanship. Kalin not
only denies the statement, but declares that,
in view of preliminary simulation of friend
ship at last week's rallies, he personally was
disappointed with the Herkelev rooters, their
obvious disregard of good taste.
Smith, devoid of any plausible excuse for
the unwarranted conduct, engages in an amus
ing if libelous bit of rationalization with the
statement that the Daily's comments were
"overemphasized, sensational, and designed
only to provoke publicity." He forgets, for the
moment, that 70,(MM) sped a tors would prefer
to leave any semblance of obscenity at home
in the California men's smokers, rather than
drag it out as a public spectacle. California's
head yell leader says that "the boys were just
showing that they were* not downhearted"
by singing the Cardinals lie Damned. A pecu
liar met hod, no doubt.

The above opinion, niÂ» in rally, originates
with the editor of this newspaper, and does
not rellcet official I'niversity sentiment. It is
his (inn belief that 'mattes of this nature
are best aired and settled onee and for all,
rather than risk the opportunity of useless and
harmful repetition. It is his own personal
desire that California and Stanford, tlie Hears
and the Indians, onee again be the friendly,
happy rivals of bygone days.
No hate, no battles, no dirt. Hut enjoyable
recreation for tans and piayei.s on both sides,
before and after the l>ig (lame that comes
mighty close to losing that rightful monicker
in the face of an unhealthy situation.
