burden upon their members that the benefits

bring undeserved discredit lo legitimate socie

gation of these organizations be made, with
a view to eliminating those that are unde
sirable.
No quarrel wilh worth-while societies is
intended. Such groups should welcome and
co-operate with a general cleaning up of the
honor society mess. For when worthy and
unworthy groups are lumped together as at
present, the outsider has no way of discrimi
nating and concludes that all arc pretty much
of the same stripe.
To clarify the question, a possible basis
for determining the worlh of these societies
might be suggested. The Daily believes thai
seleclion to membership based upon clearly
demonstrated achicveiuenl, ami consistent,
construclive, and sincere activity of some soi l,
are enough to justify I heir existence. Some
limes only Ibe lirsl qualification is necessary,
as in I lie case of Phi Beta Kappa. If, however,
only I he second is fulfilled, the honorary term
should be dropped and the society allowed lo
continue siniplv as a club. There mav he other

i criteria but these at least point the way.
Obviously there are many societies that do
not fulfill either qualification. They have no
right to exist and should he eliminated.
