# His Name Is Williams
## 
### 
There is a man on the California football
team whose actions and attitude ought in
some measure to dissipate the common and
! recurring charges that college football "isn't
I worth while." That man is Captain Arleigh
1 Williams.
Interviewed in the lilue and Cold dressing
! rooms immediately alter he had driven his
team in a game battle against Stanford, the
i "Little Champion" was anything but dejected
at the Bear's near approach to victory.
Morose he was indeed, not with defeat, but
: because his college football days were over.
Williams sentimentally recalled that he had
found the greatest pleasure and interest in
his college career founded on the friendships
he made on the playing field.
Football has been his bread and meat; it
; hsa taught him the meaning of sportsmanship
i and honor, and given him the ability to
"take it."
Captain Williams was well named, "the
, Little Champion."
