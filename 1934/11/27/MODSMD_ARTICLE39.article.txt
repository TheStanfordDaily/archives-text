II must he rather disconcerting to the die
hard prohibitionists to discover that, with
repeal, the average college student is not
drinking himself into a three - star labeled
casket.
It is not exactly a secret to the world at
large that a fair proportion of the college
undergraduates imbibe more or less freely
of the "wine when it is red," often with rather
curious results. What is strange to many
observers, however, is the fact that legality
has had little effect on the total amount con
sumed.
The fact of the matter is simply that those
who wished to drink did so, in spite of, or
perhaps because of, the Eighteenth Amend
ment. I hose who had no taste for liquor let
it alone, and repeal has had little effect either
to increase or diminish the amount consumed.
Surprisingly enough, a great many stu
dents do as they wish about the matter, in
spite ot the laet that the general opinion is
that the average student has little or no mind
of his own.â€”l'.C.L.A. Daily liruin
