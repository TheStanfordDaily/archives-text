Turning to the European field of news, the Saar
Basin problem looms as the most important, with a
special session of the League of Nations' council having
been called to consider the problem of the coming
plebiscite. The election to decide future affiliation of
the area is scheduled for January according to provi
sions of the Treaty of Versailles. Germany, France, and
the present system of control by a League of Nations
council will vie for the honor.
Professor Ralph H. Lutz, who closely follows all
significant happenings in the German field, does not
expect any serious outcome of the plebiscite result,
although he considers it a vital problem in the Euro
pean set-up.
"Until the recent move of Jugoslavia against Hun
gary. the Saar question was considered the most imme
diate threat to European peace," he said.
The basin was set aside by the Treaty of Versailles
as compensation for destruction of the coal mines of
Northern France and as part payment of total repara
tion of Germany. The delicate part of the arrangement
is that the deposits of coal in the territory became com
plete property of Fiance by the treaty.
"I think the probable outcome is that Germany
will win the election as the inhabitants are predom
inantly German, and that the council of the League
of Nations will have to re-establish German gov
ernment. However, if Germany wins she must
re-purchase France's rights of ownership of the
mines," the professor explained.
"Price of the mines is to be decided by a com
mittee including one Frenchman, one German, and
one other man to be appointed by the league. If Ger
many does not pay the price within .six months, the
territory of the mines will become French.
"Up to this week France and Germany have not
concluded any special agreements with regard to the
question of the mines. The League of Nations is now
issuing the monthly report of the plebiscite commis
sion which shows the magnitude of the problem and
the dangers to peace.
The governing commission has formally com
plained to (he League that the local gens d'armee is
not strong enough to maintain order before the
election. They also charge that Germany has estab
lished an espionage in the Saar Valley. Other
evidence points that the Nazis arc active in the
region.
"The new French cabinet has just informed Ger
many that France expects to maintain her treaty right
to send troops into the Saar if the league asks for it.
Germany has formally disavowed any plan to form i
coup in the region and protests against the threatened
use of French troops," Lutz said.
"Germany has replied to Fiance's message that
such a move would be violation of the Locarno, pact.
Up to now the British and Italians, guarantors for the
pact, have not commented."
