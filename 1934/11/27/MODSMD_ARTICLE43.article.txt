'•MADAME BUTTERFLY"' (Puc
cini), War Memorial Opera House.
Opera-goers know what to expect
when they visit Puccini's Italian
Japan with a David Belasco guide
book. It will be a pathetic evening,
watching fragile and very sweet
Cho-Cho-San mistreated, forsaken, I
tragic in death. "Madame Butter
fly," they know, is sentimental all'
Ihe way through: every turn of feel
ing is heightened to pathos in the i
libretto, and in the music of Puc
cini usually seems a little uncom
fortably sympathetic over his hero- [
ine.

But last Thursday in Saij. Fran
| cisco the opera-goers got something
rather different. The strong-voiced
and dramatic Lotte Lehmann, so
effective as Tosca, was cast for the
winsome Cho-Cho-San, a difficult
task for her. Lehmann is essentially
a dramatic (or melodramatic, if you
like) singer, suited to German op
era or a role like Tosca. She i.s
naturally unsuited to the tiny sweet
ness of Butterfly. Her voice is too
large and lacks the necessary upper
•range: she had to let high notes go,
often replacing them with shrieks,
theatrically effective but not what
Puccini intended.
However, Her very talent for em
phasizing the dramatic and the
theatrical in every musical phrase
created a more powerful Butterfly,
an intensity and force more thrilling
than sentimental, more European
than Japanese. Her hari-kari scene,
for instance, was convincing to
fright as well as pity. Lehmann is
a good operatic actress, but Butter
fly is not a role worthy of her.
The performance was smooth,
though not as well rehearsed as pre
vious productions. There was some
sensible revision of the stage ac
tion. Pietro Cimini conducted and is
to be commended for his sensitive
handling of the orchestra and the
singers; he gave a fine integration
and balance to what possible uncer
tainty there might have been on the
stage.
Dino Borgioli, reported to be ill
with a cold, sang Pinkerton surpris
ingly well. His tendency to slur was
the more noticeable, but he was ef
fective in the last act. Elino Mario
as Suzuki did a good piere of work;
her voice has a fine middle register,
and she was the most Japanese mem
ber of the cast. Unfortunately in her
second act duet with Lehmann she
set it off key.
Gandolfi was Sharpless and Marek
Windheim an excellent Goro. The
chorus was rather lamentable, while
the staging was colorful though
somewhat abrupt in lighting. Those
traditional fireflies in the first act
remain a detriment rather than a
help.

Dino Borgioli, reported to be ill
with a cold, sang Pinkerton surpris
ingly well. His tendency to slur was
the more noticeable, but he was ef
fective in the last act. Elino Mario
as Suzuki did a good piere of work;
her voice has a fine middle register,
and she was the most Japanese mem
ber of the cast. Unfortunately in her
second act duet with Lehmann she
set it off key.
Gandolfi was Sharpless and Marek
Windheim an excellent Goro. The
chorus was rather lamentable, while
the staging was colorful though
somewhat abrupt in lighting. Those
traditional fireflies in the first act
remain a detriment rather than a
help.

'•MADAME BUTTERFLY"' (Puc
cini), War Memorial Opera House.
Opera-goers know what to expect
when they visit Puccini's Italian
Japan with a David Belasco guide
book. It will be a pathetic evening,
watching fragile and very sweet
Cho-Cho-San mistreated, forsaken, I
tragic in death. "Madame Butter
fly," they know, is sentimental all'
Ihe way through: every turn of feel
ing is heightened to pathos in the i
libretto, and in the music of Puc
cini usually seems a little uncom
fortably sympathetic over his hero- [
ine.

But last Thursday in Saij. Fran
| cisco the opera-goers got something
rather different. The strong-voiced
and dramatic Lotte Lehmann, so
effective as Tosca, was cast for the
winsome Cho-Cho-San, a difficult
task for her. Lehmann is essentially
a dramatic (or melodramatic, if you
like) singer, suited to German op
era or a role like Tosca. She i.s
naturally unsuited to the tiny sweet
ness of Butterfly. Her voice is too
large and lacks the necessary upper
•range: she had to let high notes go,
often replacing them with shrieks,
theatrically effective but not what
Puccini intended.
However, Her very talent for em
phasizing the dramatic and the
theatrical in every musical phrase
created a more powerful Butterfly,
an intensity and force more thrilling
than sentimental, more European
than Japanese. Her hari-kari scene,
for instance, was convincing to
fright as well as pity. Lehmann is
a good operatic actress, but Butter
fly is not a role worthy of her.
The performance was smooth,
though not as well rehearsed as pre
vious productions. There was some
sensible revision of the stage ac
tion. Pietro Cimini conducted and is
to be commended for his sensitive
handling of the orchestra and the
singers; he gave a fine integration
and balance to what possible uncer
tainty there might have been on the
stage.
