# Naval Improvements May Follow Treaty Discarding

### 
LONDON, Nov. 26 (/P). â€”Certain
naval quarters tonight suggested
that when Japan junks the Wash
ington Naval Treaty of 1922 a "naval
race of technical improvements" may
follow, resulting in new types of
powerful warships which would
make Germany's pocket battleships
look like the galleons of old Spain.
The United States' plan, it was
indicated, would be made in gen
eral co-operation with Great Brit
ain, thereby conforming with the
American hopes for an accord on
general policies. Such an accord, it
was believed, probably will be sug
gested to Great Britain if there is
no new naval treaty.
