# CAMPUS OPINION

j The Editor, Sir:
The singing of "The Cardinals Be
Damned, Boys," etc., by the Cali
fornia rooters last Saturday should j
j be taken as indicative of the type of
mentality that attends that univer
i sity and not be attributed entirely to '
i poor sportsmanship. The fact that
1 California sang her bar-room ditty :
twice—once before any scoring was |
( done and once again when too
much had been done for her own 1
good—should show that California
was expressing her personality to a
greater degree than her feelings re
| garding the game.
Post-game justification for the j
| public rendition of the "song" as
| stated by three sons of California
; picked at random, were: "Well, we
; all sang it together" (which unison,
j of course, cleaned up the song); "We ;
! sing it in the frats, why not at the I
i game?" (demonstrative of rare ana- ;
j lytical thought); "What's the matter:
; with the song?" (comment unneces-
I sary).
Finally, Bill Johnson, yell leader
of California, may have been waving
j for silence while Cal rooters shouted
j their harmonious profanity to the
' 60-odd thousand men, women, and
children spectators, but if so, it is
regrettable, from the standpoint that
California is presumably an institute
. of higher learning, that he waved in
I such a rythmical manner. American
i social customs do not as yet approve
j the public flaunting of obscene words
| before a mixed gathering; individual '
cussing, while not applauded, is tol-
I erated, but combined filth can only ,
i serve as a dangerous boomerang. |
A. S. !
I The Editor, Sir:
"Five lonely lockoutees" the other
j day suggested that the boys respon
! sible for their dilemma send them
I candy with which to console them
i selves and pass the weary but more
j restful hours.
Dear girls, I can assure you that
we would be more than willing to
' do this were wc not watching out i
for your future health and well
-1 being. Candy is fattening and. al
though the Mae West figure with all
! its banked curves is now quite popu
i lar, you may be sure that we will j
, not allow a custom to exist that will |
I cause you girls to round out like
overstuffed sausages.
But you say that you are thin
and need to put on a few ounces of i
weight? Ah! my sweet children,
J have you forgotten your ABC's of
nutrition? Candy is bad for the
teeth and causes pimples. Further
more, it destroys the appetite. In !
| place of the desired confection may
I suggest a bowl of beef stew or a i
baked potato? Nothing is so re
freshing or soul - inspiring as a
baked potato.
i By this time you should have
guessed that after a date we are in
debt more than before and cannot
j afford even a package of gum. Fie
on you, girls. You should be
j ashamed and send us the candy.
