"THE MERRY WIDOW '
At the Stanford Theatre
Franz Lehar's immortal strains, a
1900 operetta plot, and Ernst Lu
bitsch doing a typical Lubitsch with
Jeannette Mac Donald and Chevalier
—result: delightful entertainment.
True, Lubitsch's delicate innuen
dos and subtleties sometimes jarred

with the robust
ness of the orig
inal theme—the
picture wasn't as
smooth and con
sistent as it
might have been
if it had been all
Lubitseh'?. But,

if you can accept individually Le
har's unforgettable waltzes, Mac Do
nald's lovely voice, the Albertina
Rasch waltz ballet, and the exqui
site sets and gowns of Cedric Gib
bons and Adrian, you'll think "The
Merry Widow" one of the season's
best.
Pluto steals the show from Mickey
Mouse in one of Walt Disney's most
hilarious cartoons to date, entitled
"Mickey Plays Papa." —Brill.
