tory, Nov. 26 (A 3 ). —France, it was
stated tonight in informed quarters, j
was virtually withdrawn from the |
Saar plebiscite fight, making a large '
Nazi victory probable in January.
Foreign Minister Pierre Laval and !
Chancel lor Hitler, said an uncon- ■
firmed report, have reached an un- ■
derstanding under which France |
agrees not to press the Anti-Nazi
cause and to talk no more about
sending the French army into the
Saar.
Germany To Settle
In return, according to this re
port, the Nazis have agreed to nego
tiate a financial settlement for the ,
Saar mines as soon as possible.
Laval, it was said, has indicated
both to Berlin authorities and to,
Anti-Nazis in the Saar that he is ;
unwilling to continue the battle in j
favor of a status quo, which would |
leave the Saar under League of Na
tions jurisdiction. The fight for this j
was waged by his predecessor, the '
late Louis Barthou.
Barlhou was the mouthpiece for j
Anti-Nazis at Geneva in their ef- I
fort to obtain if possible a district j
or two for France and prevent Hitler
from obtaining an overwhelming j
majority in the plebiscite.

Laval, more interested in settling |
the financial problems now being
discussed at Rome, was not expected
to give his active support to a re
quest of the Anti-Nazis that the j
League council grant the right to
hold a second plebiscite "after Hitler
is gone" should the Saar vote in Jan
uary to continue indefinitely under '
the League.
•8 Saarites, the Anti-Nazis say, wish '
to rejoin the fatherland some day,;
