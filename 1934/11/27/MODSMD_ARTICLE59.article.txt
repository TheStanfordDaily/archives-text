\ j "Nothing ever happens."
This is not a quotation from

1 ' "We do nothing around here of '

Button reservedly tilting back in his

However, if furniture in any of
i Ihe University buildings is broken,

tioning of builcfings on the campus
is usually taken care of during sum
mer months, thereby giving employ
ment to a large crew of Stanford
men during the vacation period.
Continually during the school
year, men from the corporation
yard are at work repairing roads
and paths of the campus; witness
the recent and unprecedented inno
vation of the asphalt pathway
stretching from Encina Commons
diagonally across to the Quad.
The corporation yard stands ready
and willing to function smoothly for
the mutual benefit of Stanford stu
dents and faculty. Such emergency
repair jobs as fixing a leaky or
broken radiator that refuses to emit
heat on chilly mornings, repairing
; faulty electric wiring and keeping
roads and vistas of the campus both
i usable and beautiful all come with

I yard.
