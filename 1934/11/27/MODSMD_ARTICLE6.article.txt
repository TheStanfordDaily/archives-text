# Farm Thiet Gets $99 in Double Haul
## Burglar Loots 2 Houses As Occupants Sleep 
### 
In his first appearance the year
I the Stanford campus thief played a
: double engagement at Farm frater
j nities to net himself approximately
$99 in two early morning calls dur
| ing the past week-end.
The heaviest loser in this latest
1 offensive of crime was the Chi Psi
; lodge on Salvatierra which lost
i nearly $75 to the nocturnal visitor
! who slipped into the house Friday
; night to take his loot. No exact time
( of the crime could be set but it
; must, have been some time between
12:30 and S:3O o'clock.
The other loser was the Sigma Chi
house where about $24 was taken
from three different men. Here the
thief is thought to have visited be
tween 2:30 and morning.
The house manager of Sigma Chi,
Dave Bardin, had his locker jimmied
j open and the contents pilfered. In
contrast with campus crooks of the
past, this one took nothing but cash,
j The campus police have had no
; means of tracing the thief as yet. It
; is thought that he is a professional
I fraternity burglar who has been op
crating on the Coast for the past
month. Several weeks ago the frater
nity houses at the University of
Washington were pilfered and a large
sum of money taken.
As a result of the losses, Gordon
| Qavis, campus policeman, asked all
: living groups to keep a close watch
I on strangers and for individuals to
: be more than usually careful with
I their surplus cash.
