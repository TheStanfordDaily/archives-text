# LITTLE DEFEATED BY HOERNER. 2 UP
## 
### 
Lawson Little's chances to regain j
j his number one golf team position
| were blasted yesterday afternoon by j
j Jack Hoerncr as the latter pounded
! out a two-up win over the British
! and National Amateur golf cham-
I pion in a ladder match.
The outstanding point of the
I match was the fact that it showed
! the class of the Stanford team. Of
! the players all seem about evenly
j matched on that highest rung of the
J championship class. Hoerner secured
j his track at Little through defeating j
! | Spec Stewart and Don Edwards in
| close succession. However, he
I | played Don Edwards three times J
; before finally winning.
l)\vyer Dethrones Little
, i Little was dethroned from the
| pedestal of seeded number one man
t last week when Torn Dwyer deci
[ sively defeated him by a seven and j
, ! five margin. Hoerner will now chal- i
j lenge Dwyer for the tob spot. He :
, j held it at the end of last year but
dropped down in this year's quali
! fying. He is the Nebraska State
( champion.
J Hoerner started out fast in yes- !
. : terday's match. He birdied the sec
. j ond hole to go one up. His putter
, ! was working like magic and he had j
. j very little trouble on the greens. |
| Little on the other hand has not had j
j ! that putting accuracy" that made his j
i English victories miraculous. By the |
j eighth hole Little was four down i
, but he rallied there and won the
j ninth.
Champion Fails
From that point on the match was
! all the champion's show but it was
[ impossible for him to overcome the
lead that Hoerner had put up on
' I the first nine. He went into the last
_ I hole dormie and lost.
