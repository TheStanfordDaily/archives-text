# INDIAN POLO MEN HEAD FOR TUSCON TO PLAY ARIZONA
## Rogers, on Debating Trip, Will Fly To Join Team For Second Game 
### 
Stanford versus Arizona. These,
annual contests, which will be I
played in Tucson on Thanksgiving!
and the following Saturday are the
"Big Games" of western intercolle- j
giate polo. A strong Card aggrega- \
tion, accompanied by their coach,'
Lt. Haydon Y. Grubbs, embarked
last night for the Arizona city to
meet what is reputed to be one of
the strongest college polo fours in
the West.
In spite of the loss of their veteran
No. 3 rider, Bill Rogers, for the first
till of the scries, the Indians are
confident that they can repeat their
last year's conquest of the Wildcats.
Rogers is accompanying a debate
team to Salt Lake City this week,
but he plans to fly south to rejoin
the poloists in time to participate in
Saturday's game, according to Lt.
Grubbs.
Enemark Replaces Rogers
Bill Enemark, who has been play
ing excellent polo for the reserve
Whites, will substitute for the hard
riding Rogers in the first contest.
The Card starting line-up, according
to Grubbs, will find Captain Luppe
Luppen at No. 1, Russ Rasmussen
at No. 2, Enemark at No. 3, and Bob
Fullerton at back. Cal Emeis is also
making the trip as team substitute.
In a spirited practice encounter
yesterday afternoon before they de
parted, the varsity decisively de
feated a reserve outfit composed of
Dwyer, Beal, Emeis, and Henderson,
by a score of five goals to nothing.
Excellent polo was demonstrated,
which boded no good to Arizona's
chances of whipping the champion
ship Indians.

The same Stanford line-up that
won two out of three games from |
the Wildcats last season will again
face the Arizonans, though the Curd
riders will be handicapped some
what by being forced to use horses
loaned to them by their opponents,
Lt. Grubbs stated. It is impracticable
to ship local mounts to Tucson for
the games.
Nothing is known about the Ari
zona quartet except that they are
expected to be just as tough as last
season, and the Wildcats have a
formidable record. Associated Press
dispatches from Tucson yesterday
stated that the Arizona men had
completed preparations for the Stan
ford series by beating a powerful
Southern Arizona Polo Club four by
a score of 10 to 1, for their fifth con
secutive win of the season. As the
coming contests are the first regular
contests of the year for the Cards, tlu
opposition appears to possess an
edge on previous experience and
training.
The Stanford polo party will re
turn to the campus on Monday, De
cember 3, it was stated, Arizona will

play another series with the Cards
here at Stanford in the spring, it is
planned.
