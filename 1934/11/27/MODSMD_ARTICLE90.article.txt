# Cards Battle Bear Water Poloists Today
## INDIANS WILL ANEX 2 CHAMPIONSHIPS BY DEFEATING CAL Game To Be Played at 3:45 This Afternoon In Encina Pool 
### Roger Kimball 
Stanford, fighting mad, and Cali
fornia, exalted by her first victory
over the Cards in water polo history,
will clash for the championship of 1
both leagues in the aquatic sport at
3:45 (his afternoon in Encina pool.
An inspired Golden Bear team
is out to make it two straight over
Norl Thornton's men, and the In
dians will have to hit peak form
to prevent a repetition of Califor
nia's 5-3 win Saturday at Berke- j
It y. As individually brilliant as
any college septet in Coast his
tory, the Cardinals must watch the
Bears' superb teamwork in order
to win today.
California's triumph Saturday gave j
}he Bears a tie with the Indians for j
the first plac in the Northern Cali
fornia Water Polo League. Since to
day's game is the last of the season |
for both teams, Stanford must win
to take the league title. The Cardi
nals still have an advantage of one ;
game over U.C.L.A. in the Pacific
Coast Conference ratings, but a j
California victory today would throw 1
the race into a triple lie between 1
the Cards, Bears, and Bruins.
Complete standings in the two cir
cuits are as follows:
Pacific Coast Conference
Team Won Lost Pet. l
Stanford '11 *800 .
U.C.L.A 4 2 .867 j
California 3 2 .600
U.S.C 0 6 .000
Northern California League
Team Won Lost Pet.
Stanford 6 1 .857
California 6 1 .857
Olympic Club ... 5 3 .62a
Athens Club .... 2 6 .250
Lakeside Club ~0 8 .000
The Indians must stop Captain Ed
"Wink" Davis and Danny Kuhns,
great Bear forwards, today, or they j
will again find themselves on the j
short end of the score. Jack Dozier i
;nd Weldon Smith, guards, proved
themselves dead-eyes by scoring ,
two of the five Bear goals Saturday, j
Kuhns. who scored twice, will :
compete for individual honors with
Stanford's Captain Leo Cook, who
was held to one goal in the first (
£;imc. Bob Foster established him
self as another prominent Card scor
ing ace by making two of the three
goals credited to the Indians.
Indian Chances Even
In spite of their defeat Saturday,
Nort Thornton's men are conceded
an even chance of turning the tables
today. The knowledge that they are
the first team which has ever lost
to California may give them just the
added incentive necessary to victory.
Since the Bears, with their renewed
confidence, are also on the warpath,

j anything is likely to happen.
j Two positions in the starting Card
inal line-up are doubtful, but oth
-1 erwise posts on both teams are fairly
certain. Those starting the game wiil
I probably be as follows:
Line-up Unchanged
Stanford: forwards,. Captain Leo
Cook, Bob Foster, and Bill Clemo
ior Vlad Taranik; guards, Wally
Wiget, Bill Woodard, and Jimmy
Benet or Bob Sutherland: goalie,
Bob Haslacher.
California: forwards, Captain
J "Wink" Davis, Danny Kuhns, and
George Lawrence; guards, Weldon
Smith, Jack Dozier, and Jim Mc-
Clure; goalie, Bill Johnson.
The varsity game will immediately
follow the frosh tussle, which will
start at 3 o'clock. Admission for the
double bill is 25 ceyts with student
body cards, arid 40 cents without
j them.

The Indians must stop Captain Ed
"Wink" Davis and Danny Kuhns,
great Bear forwards, today, or they j
will again find themselves on the j
short end of the score. Jack Dozier i
;nd Weldon Smith, guards, proved
themselves dead-eyes by scoring ,
two of the five Bear goals Saturday, j
Kuhns. who scored twice, will :
compete for individual honors with
Stanford's Captain Leo Cook, who
was held to one goal in the first (
£;imc. Bob Foster established him
self as another prominent Card scor
ing ace by making two of the three
goals credited to the Indians.
Indian Chances Even
In spite of their defeat Saturday,
Nort Thornton's men are conceded
an even chance of turning the tables
today. The knowledge that they are
the first team which has ever lost
to California may give them just the
added incentive necessary to victory.
Since the Bears, with their renewed
confidence, are also on the warpath,

j anything is likely to happen.
j Two positions in the starting Card
inal line-up are doubtful, but oth
-1 erwise posts on both teams are fairly
certain. Those starting the game wiil
I probably be as follows:
Line-up Unchanged
Stanford: forwards,. Captain Leo
Cook, Bob Foster, and Bill Clemo
ior Vlad Taranik; guards, Wally
Wiget, Bill Woodard, and Jimmy
Benet or Bob Sutherland: goalie,
Bob Haslacher.
California: forwards, Captain
J "Wink" Davis, Danny Kuhns, and
George Lawrence; guards, Weldon
Smith, Jack Dozier, and Jim Mc-
Clure; goalie, Bill Johnson.
The varsity game will immediately

both leagues in the aquatic sport at

An inspired Golden Bear team
