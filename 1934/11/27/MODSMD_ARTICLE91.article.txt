## EARLY PREDICTIONS PROVED CORRECT 
### 
Three predictions were made in
the special edition of The Daily two
weeks before fall quarter opened,
and now that football season is over
they can be summed up. The three
all proved correct.
In the first place, The Daily then
said: "Stanford will not come through
the season completely unscathed
And that "Stanford will again de
feat both California and U.S.C."
The first was correct in essence
but not in spirit. The Santa Clara tie
could be construed as meaning Stan
ford was not "unscathed," but the
writer frankly admits he was pre
dicting, in spirit, that the Indians
would be defeated once at least.
As for the other two predictions,
j they sound easy now, but if one re
calls the publicity coming from
Bear and Trojan camps at the start
of the season, he will remember both
rivals were talked up as the same
powerful aggregations of former
years. Bill Ingram of California
! flatly claimed his Bears would be
playing in the Rose Bowl; but that
war before the season opened, and
particularly before the St. Mary's
: game.
