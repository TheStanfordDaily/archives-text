# UNNOTICED GESTURE TOUCHED OUR HEARTS
## 
### 
It was just after the bands had
left the field at the close of The
Star-Spangled Banner and as the
California team was lined up for
the opening kick-off in Saturday's
Big Game. The entire Stanford
eleven came to the sidelines and
1 waved.
1 The team was waving to Monk
Moscrip, all-American end hurt
| during the final week of practice
and sitting up in the press box.
Comparatively few spectators no
ticed the gesture, but it obviously
1 moved Moscrip deeply.

Concerning Moscrip, why couldn't ;
j either the Stanford or California
rooting sections have included some
simple card stunt for him? Each
I section gave mention to Red Chris
tie of the Bears, and the Californians
added a stunt to Floyd Blower, both j
injured members of the Blue and
Gold eleven. The- stunt would not
have had to be elaborate and it
coyld easily have been planned Fri->'
day after it was definite Monk would
not play.
