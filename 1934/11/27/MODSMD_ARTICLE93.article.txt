# BIG GAME WON'T HURT BOWL CHANCES
## 
### 
Wc don't believe the physical set
back, which crippled the entire
Cardinal team, .suffered in the
rough Big Game, will affect the In
dians' Ro?a Bowl chances.
All of the men probably will be
well, and the beating will work the
psychological advantage of instilling
the idea into Stanford of continuing
the proof of her claims to national
honors. Every game up until the
Washington game helped in this
campaign, but the California clash
hardly showed more than a Card
superiority over the Bears.
Stanford is still remembering the
beating of last year, and what is
worse, the East, collectively, also
remembers it. Stanford' is ' never
mentioned on the other side of the
Rockies as the place, for instance,
that produced a national champion
ship track team, or as the school
which produced Herbert Hoover,
Ben Eastman, Lawson Little, but as
the team that lost to Lou Little's
Columbia Lions in last year's Pasa
dena contest.
Considering the manner in which
Columbia gained that victory, that
is a little more than the Cardinal
machine cares to take without a
comeback. That comeback is plan
ned for January 1, 3935, and the In
dians don't care whether it's Ala
bama, Colgate, Minnesota, Temple,
or anyone else. —Browne.
