leagues yesterday in Eneina pool.
The Card frosh repeated their Ber
keley victory over the Bear Cubs
with a triumph by the margin of 3
to 1 in the preliminary game.
Nort Thornton's varsity made a
great come-back from the defeat
suffered in the Bears' tank Satur
day. Captain Leo Cook and Bill
Clemo, with three goals each,
played like champions in forward
positions, and YVally Wiget and
Bill Woodard were in the thick of
the fight all the time at guards.
Bob Haslachcr made numerous
line stops in the goal.
Indians Score First
For the first time in several weeks,

scoring three times before the first
California goal. ' The speed of Bob
Foster in the sprint position gave

the varsity water polo team
last night at a banquet given
the entire team at the Sigma Nu
house.

Stanford the ball nearly every time,
and the Cards kept control of the
play. Bill Clemo scored first on a
pretty shot from close in, after less
than two minutes.
Captain Cook made the second
goal after a hard fight for the ball.
The huge Card leader was held by
the opposing guard on this play, but
got the ball into the net as if he'd
been fveo. Shortly after Cook's shot,
Stanford's Wiget and Clemo and
Bud Ramsauer of the Bears were
thrown out of the game lor their
lough tactics.
Clever Shot Scores
"Cookie" soon scored again on a
clever shot from 15 feet out, but.
Jimmy Benet then left the game by
the referee's request. Danny Kuhns
made good on a free throw of the
aquatic sport for the first Golden
Bear goal. After Ramsauer again
left the pool, Clemo made the count
4 to 1 on a southpaw penalty shot.
With one minute to go in the first
half, George Lawrence sank a 12-
footer for the Bears, and the score
remained 4 to 2 as the period ended
Stanford took only the first 30 see
in a flurry of fast, rough play.
onds of the final half to score again
on a superb bat-in shot by Cook,
who took a perfect pass from Wiget
on the fly, and deflected it into the
Bear goal. Vlad Taranik then macte
a clever short effort to stretch the
margin to 0-2. Within the next two
minutes, Bob Kaslacher made a
pretty stop, Woodard, Foster, and
Smith all left the tank, and Captain
Wink Davis made a short goal for
the Bears.
Bears Come In
The next goal was also made by
Davis, on a 20-footer, which put the
Bears back in the running, with the
count 6 to 4. Bill Clemo went in for
Taranik, drew Goalie Bill Johnson of
California out of position, and made
a clever shot to the corner for the
Cardinals' final goal. In the closing
seconds of play, Danny Kuhns scored
a pretty side shot for the Bears, but
! the score remained 7 to 5 as the In- I
' dians kept the ball.
The crowd of approximately 300
not only saw Stanford flefout Cali
fornia, but also witnessed the In
dia?!* close their 19,14 season with
both the Northern California
Water Polo League and tiie Pa-
I cific Coast Conference titles in
their possession.
Other features of the game were I
, Stanford's convincing revenge for |
I her first, loss in 21 years of play with j
, California, and the ducking of '
i Coach Thornton, v/ho was thrown in I
i with all his clothes on, by the jubi- !
j lant Cardinals.
Line-ups were as follows:
Stanford — Forwards, Cook (c.),
Foster, Clemo, and Taranik; guards,
i Wiget, Woodard, Benet, and Suther
land; goalie, Haslacher.
California—Forwards, Davis (c.), |
Lawrence, Kuhns, and Langworthy; ;
guards, Smith, Dozier, McClure, and j
Ramsauer; goalie, Johnson.
Frosh Win Easily
Consistently keeping the upper
hand in slower game, the Stanford
frosh had less trouble with the Bear i
Cub septet than in the first game at I
Berkeley. The Papooses started j
slowly, but soon gained their stride I
as Jack Loupe scored on a tip-in
from Warren Smith, and Bill Hanna j
sank a beauty from the center of the I
pool. The first half ended with the |
count still standing at 2 to 0.
Early in the second period. Smith j
fooled the Cub guard and made a ]
short goal, but Fisher soon scored j
for California's yearlings on a near I
push-in shot. A splurge of missed
shots brought the game to a close !
with the .'1 to I score remaining.
Loupe, Smith, and Hanna starred
for the undefeated frosh, who should j
furnish good material, especially at j
forwards, for the 1935 varsity. Fisher 1
and Shields looked good for the
Bear Cubs.
