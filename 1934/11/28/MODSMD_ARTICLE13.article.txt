# CHAPPIE SELLS TEAM DRAWINGS
## Big Game Issue Sold Out; Copy Due Dec. 3 
### 
Big Game issue of Chaparral was
! a complete sell-out, according to
j Lyman Tondro, circulation manager,
I but students who wish copies of the
j four-page insert with Ollie John
jston's drawing of Coach Tiny Thorn
-1 hill and his Pacific Coast cham
; pions may get them b£ bringing a
; nickel around to the Chappie ofiicc
: any afternoon next week.
This issue of 1,400 copies followed
i a precedent set by the "Back to the
\ Ftirm" number. The first issue of
the year sold out its 1,000 copies on
the first day also.
Business Manager Everett Clai
borne can see a moral in this habit
of Chaparral to sell out. He says it
I makes it necessary for students to
! subscribe, if they wish to be sure of
j getting their Chappies.
Editor Gordon Steedman, going off
: on a different tack, suggests to his
■ stooges that they "Do Their Christ
mas Chappying early." Deadline is
j December 3, and Thanksgiving vaca
i tion is a good time to grind out the
' quips, thinks Steedman.
