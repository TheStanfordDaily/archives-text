# New Type Of '7-8' Devised
## 
### 
Continuing and elaborating on the
system inaugurated at their last
jolly-up, freshman women will give
another "7 to 8" December 5 in
Robl'e Gymnasium. "The last one
was successful," said Beth Allen,
chairman of the affair, "but we in
tend this one to be a huge success.
Under the new system no man can
enter the dance floor unless accom
panied by a woman. For the first
half hour dancers will trade part
ners every three minutes. During
the last half-hour free cutting will
be allowed.
Jim Triolo will act as master of
ceremonies, announcing the change
of dances and seeing that the trading
is done.
Arrangements for the orchestra
are indefinite as yet
