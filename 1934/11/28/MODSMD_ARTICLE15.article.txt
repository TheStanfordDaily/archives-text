Thanksgiving vacation means!
j mother's home cooking and four
; lazy play days to some Stanford
students.
"Say good-bye to me, I'm going
home," said one enthusiastic fresh
| man Monday afternoon as he barged
| into the post office. "Skipping classes
j and everything," he added rather
! boastfully. And he probably wasn't
! the first person to improve on the
j four-day leave —some classes looked i
; pretty thin Tuesday morning,
j "I'm leaving after twelve today,
and I don't have any studying to
j do," comments the "one-in-a-hun
: dred" student who neither cuts
| classes nor lets his work pile up.
i To some students, though, Thanks
! giving vacation doesn't, seem like
such a rosy time. Just listen to the
| table conversation.
"Wouldn't it be terrible if we
I didn't have Thanksgiving vacation
j in which to catch up? I'd never have

my work done."
"Am I glad we're having a lull.
I've got a term paper."
"Are you going home for the holi
days?" says one student to another.
"Not much!" is the reply. "I'm
hardly going to have time to eat
my Thanksgiving dinner, I've got so
much work to do!"
"I'll have some fun these next
few days when I'm not reading the
"Autobiography of Lincoln Stef
fens."
"No, I guess I can't come and visit
you during the holidays. I have a
Chaucer ex and a term paper to do."
"I'm going home, but I'm going to
have to finish an education notebook
sometime between sleeping and eat
ing and going places." z
At any rate, Thanksgiving vaca
tion starts officially tonight. And,
no doubt, every Stanford student is
thankful whether it's for the oppor
tunity to catch up i>n sleep, to study,
or to play.
