### 
It looks like Alabama and Stan- j
ford in the Rose Bowl January 1,
and the only thing that would change
this match would be for the Crimson
Tide of Tuscaloosa to drop its
Thanksgiving Day game tomorrow
with Vanderbilt.
Alfred R. Masters, Board of Ath- !
letic Control graduate manager, has
sole jurisdiction and is empowered to
invite an eastern team. He may in
vite Alabama immediately after her ,
game tomorrow, if the Tide wins.

Sale of rooters' tickets for the
Pasadena Rose Bowl game on
New Year's Day will start some
time next week, with general
admission pasteboards available

ford's opponent has not yet
been definitely chosen, the
Board of Athletic Control was
unable to state the price of Rose
Bowl tickets, or the exact date
when they will go on sale.

forthcoming that Alabama or any
other team is under consideration, it
is generally understood it will be
the Crimson vs. the Cardinal.

that no announcement would be
made until the first of next week.
Colgate Has Chance
Should the underdog Vanderbilt
eleven upset the mighty Tide of
Alabama, the field will be thrown
wide open again, with Andy rr's
Colgate leading the remaining field.
Colgate meets Brown in her final
game tomorrow-
Minnesota, generally rated the
country's number one team, has ap
peared more and more certain to re

seriously considering them.
There is still a faint possibility of
either Pittsburgh or Temple being
asked.
Stanford has not officially ac

indicated by B.A.C. officials that
there is little chance of a refusal.
