# Ex Committee Drops Honor Group Probe; Heads Deny Charges
## Al Blackman, Iris Forsythe Say Societies Have Social Purpose 
### 
In reply to yesterday's Daily edi
torial which stated that campus hon
oraries should be dropped if not car
rying on "consistent, constructive,
and sincere activity of some sort,"
two honor society members stated
that the existence of an honor society
does not need to be justified on the
basis of work done.
No Purpose
"The attack of The Daily is un
called for because honor societies do
not need to have a purpose for their
existence," was'the opinion of A!
Blackman, past president of Scalpers,
sophomore men's honorary, and pres
ent senior man on the Ex Commit
tee.
"An honor society justifies itself.
There is no publicity given to elec
tions; so no feelings are hurt. Scalp
ers and Skull and Snakes collect no
dues, unless they wish to have a
picture in the Quad, which nullifies
the point that honoraries are an un
justifiable expense to members. I
believe that there is a place for
honor societies on the campus."

"The existence of Cap and Gown
does not need to be justified on the
basis of work accomplished or activ
ities entered into," stated Iris For
sythe, president of the women's so
ciety. "Members of Cap and Gown
are elected for recognition of past
achievements, and carry on individ
ually, while members of the organi
zation, as enthusiastic supporters and
leaders of campus activities."
"Aside from its regular functions,
Cap and Gown is distinctly a bene
fit in passive ways. For its mem
bers it offers invaluable contacts and
a definite tie to the campus when
returning. Honor societies do not
have to continually keep their ac
tivities before the public in order
to justify their existence."
