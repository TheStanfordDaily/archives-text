# He Was Acquitted

Samuel Insull, lluil lovable old gentleman
who bilked thousands of investors of si ()(),-
00(1,(MM) but who said he was sorry about it,
and all his 10 eodufendants have been ac
quitted of charges that the government spent
two years and two months iu developing. And
the decision was handed down, not after long
and thoughtful deliberation but in the record
time <if two hours and two minutes.
Perhaps it is wrong to consider a man guilty
after a jury of his peers has found him inno
cent hut the unbiased observer cannot help
but wonder in this case. Men do not often
scurry across the face of the globe like hunted
animals, seeking refuge in any country that
will grant it, unless they have a mighty guilty
conscience. Nor does the government spend
its valuable time and money pursuing a man
month after month unless it has pretty con
clusive evidence of guilt. Several thousand
investors know that they have been bilked.
And most <>! them still have a pretty definite
opinion as to who did it.
Why Insull was acquitted is hard to say.
Some believe that there were 100 many big
names involved and that it was best just to
forget the whole thing.
The main reason, however, probably rests
on the psychology of the soil-hearted Ameri
can people who can slill be swayed by old age
and a few tears. Had the accused been of low
origin and limited opportunity the crime of
robbery would have meant conviction even
though it might have been excusable. ' Hut
Insull, a man of intelligence who certainly
knew better, is such a nice old gentleman and
he used such refined methods to rob Ihe
people!
When an erring capitalist receives such
easy treatment from a jury of average men,
one must conclude that class conflict in Amer
ica is a far-distant myth. The spectators
cheered at the verdict !
