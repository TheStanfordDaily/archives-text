Well, perhaps egg tossing, soap box ha

Again, those institutions which found them
j selves blessed with radical demonstrations
are not particularly notable for their keen

they were saddled with administrative, or

free speech, a condition which rarely fails to
fan the spark smouldering in the breasts of
i the malcontented.

fair opportunity to disgorge it; consequently
he can afford to do it like a gentleman, with-
I out the popular appurtenances of rotten eggs,
tear gas, and the metropolitan front page.
Maybe it is apathy; we prefer to call it
