# VIEWING THE NEWS
## WITH HAROLD H. FISHER 
### CHARLOTTE BURRIDGE 
Political turmoil of one kind or another continues to
keep European relations at the top of the news. At
this point Jugoslavia seems to be leading the trouble.
Supported by the other members of the Little Entente,
Czechoslovakia and Rumania, she has presented to
the Council of the League of Nations a note charging
Hungarians with responsibility for the assassination of
King Alexander and Foreign Minister Barthou. Harbor
ing of Croatian terrorists was given as Hungary's part.
Harold Fisher of the history department, who is
particularly interested in the European field, does
not believe the recent Jugoslav-Hungarian difficulty
to be of any great significance. It is, of course, one
of the little incidents backed up by historical move
ments that can assume great importance to the highly
nationalistic European groups.
"The Hungarian government has denied any ac
tivity in protecting Croatian terrorists and has recom
mended that the matter be investigated immediately
by the League of Nations Council rather than at the
next meeting." Fisher explained. '"The Italians sup
ported the Hungarians in their denial, and refused
to permit extradition of certain Croations accused of
being involved in the assassinations."
France's Laval made every effort to tone down
the Jugoslav note to the League. In fact, it is said
that he spent all of one night trying, withoyt suc
cess. That indicates that France is not hacking the
Little Ententeâ€”.which is, of course, a good sign.
"I don't think that Jugoslavia will push the matter
because she is too isolated politically, and the French-
Italian relations arc- very good just now," the historian
said.
"Czechoslovak and Rumanian sister Entente mem
bers have no personal interest in the matter. Hungary
is the only one likely to want to press the investiga
tion since they are accused of something of which.
I agree, they are probably innocent.
"If this does come up befoi'e the Council of the
League of Nations, which it will uniess all parties are
persuaded to cool off, the investigations may give up
revelations and accusations about the political exiles
of several countries," Fisher said.
Almost every country is harboring people who for
political reasons cannot go home, so once they start
investigating refugees there is going to be a lot of
cross accusation in Europe.
Summarizing the European situation as it now
stands. Fisher said: "If there were a balanced
grouping of powers as in 1914. any little incident
like the current Jugoslavia matter might lip it
over, hut at the present time there is not such
balance."
