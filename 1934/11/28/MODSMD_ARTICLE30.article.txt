# RENO: CITY OF SIN
## 
### 
RENO, Nev., Nov. 25. — A bright three-quarters
moon hangs over Reno. It has been a long 260 miles
: from the Farm, and now—after all is done—it. is sweet
! to contemplate the moon and write. The trip was beau
j tiful: San Joaquin Valley disgustingly flat, and n
| State Highway Patrolman disgustingly insistent, but
! snow in the high Sierras more than compensated for
all such. Through Donner Pass with a fleeting thought
| for those who perished that California might be the
I land of the good, the beautiful, and the true. Reno
1 and no sales tax was a relief.
Sunday night in Reno means church bells and
j gambling halls. Needless to say, the halls are more
attractive to the majority of the city. Stanford de
j haters, due in Salt Lake tomorrow for a debate tourna
ment, followed the majority of the city—in the capacity
I of sociological students in search of truth and the
scientific method.
Motley's the name of the gambling crowd. There
; are few clean shirts and fewer pressed coats. There are
j whites and browns and yellows. There are heavy
1 beards and haggard faces: shcepherders, army men.
1 day laborers, clerks, bums. Cigars are everywhere in
I evidence; they seem to go with fat bellies, and shifty
! gamblers' eyes.
Gambling, as everything else, is regulated in Reno.
| It is open, above board, and very democratic: every
| one has the same right to lose his money. There are
high-priced games for those who have, and five-cent
! minimums for the small fry. If you stay long enough
you win; if you stay long enough you lose. Reno lives
on those who stay too long.
The gambling den of Brisbane is here: his hell is
I simply one where the suckers get taken. But the low
den of the moral crusaders is utterly absent. There are
I not. the halls where, beneath dimmed lights, drink
| sodden men lose their rolls and plot horrid crimes,
j There is plenty of light, and government regulation,
which is better than San Francisco.
This is Reno, the "Biggest Little City in the World,"
but still rather small. This is the original home of the
rough, and here the rough remains. No, the Stanford
debaters left Monday morning for Salt Lake.
