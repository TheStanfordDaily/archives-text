"THOMAS CRAVEN: MODERN
ART: THE MEN, THE MOVE
MENTS. THE MEANING." Simon
6c Sinister, 1!)34. New York.

Thomas Craven is the well-known
author of "Men of Art," an unquali
fied success, and the present vol
ume, "Modern Art: The Men, ih. 5
Movements, the Meaning/' promises
to eclipse in popularity his earlier
work.
Craven finds lhat the "modern
school" in art has not definitely com?
to an end, and the lime for a
critical appraisal of its accomplish
ment.sis at hand. This he has under
taken to do in a treatment of nearly
400 pages.
The art critic commences with a
study of the Bohemian creed, and art
at the beginning of a new century.
He then examines the work of such
artists as Van Goh, Matisse, Picasso
and Grosz, names familiar to any
exhibit room of modern art.
The last third of the book is es
pecially interesting to the general
reader as it is devoted altogether to
contemporary American art. He de
velops a background and then pre
sents a most entertaining account of
how modern American art is coming
into its own.
The volume contains some 35
illustrations. One finishes it with
the impression that Craven is a clear
and vigorous thinker, commanding
his subject, in a vivid and enter
taining manner. —Larson.
