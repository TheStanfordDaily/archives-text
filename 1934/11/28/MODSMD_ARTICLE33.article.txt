# NEW RECORDINGS
## 
### 
Pinky Tomlin's singing of "The
Object of My Affections" has taken
the Pacific Coast by storm; so it
i.i only natural that Jimmy Grier's
Brunswick record of it. with the
above-mentioned Tomlin doing the
1 vocal honors, is the best seller among
phonograph records tody* The num
-1 her is 7308, and on the other side
is "Somebody's Birthday," which,
unfortunately, is just another one of
i those things.
From the new Bruadway show,
"Anything Goes," Paul Whiteman
does a concert medley on Victor
36141 which is only fair, but on the
reverse side Ray Noble's Orchestra
does an excellent arrangement of
the tunes from the new Gaumont-
British picture, "Evergreen."
From another new Broadway
thow, "Say When," comes a record
of the title number and "When Love
Come.'- Swinging Along," both played
by Richard Himber's Orchestra,
I which this writer thinks is the best
new recording for Victor.
Noel Coward's new show, "Con
versation Piece," furnished two de
lightful numbers, "I'll Follow My
i Secret Heart," and "Nevermore."
Noble does these two for Victor on
! one of the most beautiful records it
has ever been our pleasure to hear.
They feature simple, but exquisite,
arrangements. Ambrose and his or
chestra do the same two numbers
for Decca on 24G.
Dick Jurgens and his "Frantic"
orchestra disced four numbers for
Decca a few weeks ago, and they
1 have just been issued. No. 268 car
ries "In the Quiet of An Autumn
Night" and "Strange."' "Wild Hon-
I cy" and "Just OnceiToo Often" are
[ pressed on 269.
I I Orville Knapp and his boys, an
j other well-liked Coast aggregation,
do "Talking to Myself" and "Believe
! Me" on Decca's 224.
