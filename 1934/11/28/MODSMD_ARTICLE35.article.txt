# CAMPUS OPINION

### 
The Editor, Sir:
Last Saturday afternoon some
60.000 spectators were horrified (with
the exception of the many who were
pleased) to hear the California root
ing section sing '.hat awful song.
"The Cardinals Be Damned, Boys."
etc.
Shortly after, in this column, somt
self-appointed defender of public
morals and upholder of propriety in
collegiate rivalry righteosuly pointed
out that, by this act, these Califor
nians, represented as "typical," had
proved themselves to be the pos
sessors of an inferior mentality.
However right this criticism may
be, though, it was noticeable that
the "Stanford Axe" was not repre
sented as a definitely superior ox
ample of the fine art of rooting sec
tion performance. Fact is, the "Axe'
yell carries an implication, the so
cial consequences of which are con
siderably more serious than the
use of bad wards could ever be.

The Editor, Sir:
I should like to thank Bob Jones,
' chairman of the 1934 Bonfire com
mittee, for the wonderful efficiency
that he showed in organizing, build
j ing, and cleaning up the debris. Bob
i not only kept the cost of the fire
: extremely low, but his dealings with
business men and other people who
i contributed a share to the fire were
â–  very diplomatic.
There is no doubt that the new
idea of bonfire construction proved
I to be very satisfactory. I only hope
; that in the future there will be at
j least a few men like Jones, willing
| to serve the Associated Students in
a similar manner.
