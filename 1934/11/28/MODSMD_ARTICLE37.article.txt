# FIRES IN STADIUM ON BIG GAME DAY AVERAGE 10 TO 12
## 
### HERB DIAMOND 
Ten or twelve fires in the Stanford
stadium on a Big Game day is an
average number—the startling re
sult of carelessness. So stated Chief
R. D. Dugan's student fire-fighters
employed at the campus firehouse.
Haystack iires about the farm are
another great responsibility of the
local department. Spring quarter
several years ago an "epidemic"
seemed to appear among the hay
stacks. For I's consecutive days the
entire force spent the evening and
most of the morning battling the
pyres of burning hay.
"And it wouldn't have been so
bad," one of the informing firemen
explained, "but they a.'l came during
the final examination pei'iod, and we
lost a lot of study, to say nothing of
sleep." The haystack fires are an
annual spring quarter occurrence.
It is on occasions such as these,
ho added, that the boys are called
upon to jump from their beds, get
into their trousers, boots, and shirts
in the same move, and board their
light Cadillac truck. The truck, in
cidentally, is the reincarnated pri
vate toui ing car which was used by
Comptroller Almon Roth way back
when.
The pei onnel of the campus de
partment usually numbers 15, five
more experienced men and ten stu
dents. On Big Game days, how
ever, as many as ten extra students
are put on the job. At the present
time SEL'A funds arc paying five of
the employees.
A recent fire answered on the cam
pus occurred in one of the Union
building offices. The person report
ing the blaze evidently became ex
cited and reported it to the fire
house by phone from the Union Cel
lar instead of using the fire box on
the coiner. This caused much delay |
in valuable time, say the firemen,
and they advise the use of the fire
box on all occasions of fire.
Chief Dugan, having had twenty j
years of experience in San Francisco
and ten years at the local firehouse, i
is deeply respected by his force
all hough his earnest support of Sin- !
clajr in the recent gubernatorial I
race caused many a humorous up- I
roar and argument at the house.
