# Salt Content Decreasing In Palo Alto Wells
## 
### 
Salt content of the wells in North I
Palo Alto is decreasing, to the great!
joy of the residents there.
Stanford's geology department has j
made a survey which reveals that j
the amount of saline water seeping
into the wells from the bay has de
creased. The fact that the ground i
water is regaining its freshness is j
due to the plugging up of old wells j
in 1 his region, a step advised by j
Professor C. F. Tolman.
Palo Alto's water table has been j
sinking at the rate of five feet a I
year since 1916; consequently when
the layers of protective shale sur- '
rounding the bay were punctured b>
wells, the salty water of the bay
percolated downward and contami- '
nated the fresh water table.
