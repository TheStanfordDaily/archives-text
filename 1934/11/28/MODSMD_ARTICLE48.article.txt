# Gael, Oregon Tilt Tops Grid Menu of Week
## S.C.-Husky Game Saturday At Los Angeles 
### Phil Duffy 
Pacific Coast football is divided
into two phases this week with sev
eral games being played tomorrow
and the rest on Saturday.
Holding the Thanksgiving Day
limelight in the Bay district will be
the St. Mary's-Oregon game in Kezar
Stadium. Last year after being
crushed by U.S.C., the Webfevt pro
ceeded to defeat the Gaels 13-7 on
tlie following Saturday. This year
Oregon's defeat by Troy was even
more overwhelming and the north
ern team is again vowing lo repeat
last year's performance.
In Sacramento the Cal Aggies and
Sacramento Junior College will re
sume their annual feud. The Aggies
won last year 16-6 but should have a
tougher time this year.
Bruins Meet Loyola
San Jose State plays Whitticr in
the Spartan Stadium, while Fresno
State entertains Nevada, and Chico
plays host to th ■ College of the
Pacific.
In the South the Bruins and Loyola
tangle in Los Angeles in an effort to
prove which is the strongest • team
in the sector. In the North, Gonzaga
entertains Montana, and the Uni
versity of Idaho travels to Omaha
for and interseetional game with I
Creighton University.
The Pacific Coast feature on Sat- j
urday, December 1, will be the'
Washington - Southern California j
tussle in Los Angeles. The Huskies j
pounded out a 10-0 victory over the j
Trojans last year and expect to send |
S.C. farther down the conference;
ladder this week-end. Washington j
State journeys to Detroit for a game
with Detroit University.
Alabama in Tilt
On Thanksgiving Day the eyes of j
the South will be turned on the Alu- i
bama-Vanderbilt tilt. The Crimson
Tide are reigning favorites for the j
eastern Rose Bowl bid and an upset i
would injure their chances. 'Bama j
won over Vanderbilt last season 7-0. i
Colgate University, which is being |
boomed by scribes of the New York j
papers for the Pose Bowl, meets!
Brown tomorrow. Andy Kerr's only !
defeat of the season was a 10-7 loss
to Chico State. They stopped the
parade for national honors of Colum
bia, Syracuse, and Tulane and feel
they should he given the invitation j
to Pasadena.
Temple Undefeated
Temple University, still unde- I
feated with one tie, play Bucknell ;
tomorrow in their first appearance.
Pop Warner would gladly accept a I
western invitation but has little !
chance of getting one. The Big Six
title will also be Redded tomorrow j
afternoon when Nebraska and Kan- ;
sas State meet. Neither have lost a j

conference game.
Pittsburgh Panthers, still in the
running for the Rose Bowl, tangle
with Carnegie Tech in what should
be a breather for Pitt. On Saturday
undefeated Louisiana State meets the
once defeated Tulane, who have a
good chance of beating Huey Long's
pride and joy. Also the annual fight
between the Army and Navy will
hold the light in eastern gridiron
circles.
