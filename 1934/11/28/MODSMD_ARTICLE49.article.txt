Lawson Little, present holder of the British and American amateur golf championships, managed to
break away from his studies at Stanford university long enough to show Bobby Jones, former world's king,
how he putted his way to fame. Little is shown here dropping a long putt during a match in San Fran
cisco, with Jones crouched to Little's left looking on. Jones and Stuart Hawtey, California champ, turned
back Little and Ernest Peiper, jr., San Jose, Calif., youth, 4 and 3. (Associated Press Photo)
