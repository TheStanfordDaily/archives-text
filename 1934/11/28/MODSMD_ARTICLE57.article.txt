ONCE JUST A FEW;
NOW CARDS HAVE MANY
Stanford's starting line-up in the
Big Game was almost exactly the
same that ran through signal drill
on the first day of practice in Sep
tember. That is somewhat signifi
cant. .
But in September, the Indians had
only twelve proved football play
ers—Monk Moscrip, Bob Reynolds,
Woody Adams, Wes Muller, Larry
Rouble, Claude Callaway, Keith
Topping, Frank Alustiza, Bones
Hamilton, Bobby Grayson, Buck
Van Dellen, and Bob Maentz.
Stanford was in had shape from
the reserve standpoint. Ail of the
city journals guffed about how the
Indians would be fine until one of
the regulars was injured, and then
would they do for substitutes?
But gradually, as the season pro
gressed these positions were filled
in and now there are reserves at
every position that come up into
almost the same class as the varsity.
Stanford will not be an eleven man
team as she goes into the Rose Bowl,
but will have a well-rounded squad.
It started when Muller was in
jured and Alf Brandin and Niels
I.arsen stepped in, then Bob
Black proved himself nearly as ca
pable as Adams in the running
guard position. Jack Clark gave
early indications of his plan to
run Topping a merry race, and
last week both Alex Tronnpas and
Carl Sehott filled iu for Moscrip.
Last week, also, Stan Anderson
and Ray Todd proved capable sub
stitutes for Grayson and Alustiza.
and Gordy Head had shown himself
worthy 'of first string right half
backing when Hamilton was moved
to lull to take the temporarily-in
jured Grayson's job. Johnny Reisner
.has been going smoothly at left halt
in place of Maentz and Van Dellen.
Jack Walton, wilh lots of weight
and remarkable speed for his size,
bud shown abilities all along when
called on to replace Rouble, and Erl
Lettunich and Jack Drown are vet
erans from way back and work in
nicely when Reynolds and Calla
way are out.
The significant thing about these
proven substitutes is that in most
cases they showed their abilities
when they had to; that is, when
(lie first-stringer was injured. At
tirst, Black caused much worry,
but he advanced to the position
of making Adams' position quite
precarious.
So next year, Stanford will start
practice with not the same 12 men
of acknowledged abilities, but wilh
i 20-odd proven athletes, and many

more potential stars.
This may be the biggest factor
in keeping the Stanfords together
for their third successful year.
When the Cards' 1935 potentiali
ties are mentioned, the example is
cited of the many athletes who, in
their senior year, have eased off and
been much more ineffective than
they were in their junior year. With
.second stringers battling valiantly
for regular work in every position,
the present varsity will have an in
centive for play matching or exceed
ing that of this year.
STANFORD HONORED
ON A.P. ALL-COAST
The Associated Press choice of an
all-Coast football team gave Tiny
Thornhill's Indians quite a hand
out. Four men on the first team is
quite a distinction, and distinctively
contrary to the usual procedure, but
added to these four are five more on
the second string.
This leaves only Woody Adams
and Buck Van Dellen without the
first or second honor. Adams, who
was given honorable mention, was
injured during much of the season
arid Bob Black played enough to
divide the selectors' attention. Van
Dellen, who alternated with Bob
Maentz all year, was in the same
position. —Browne.

The significant thing about these
proven substitutes is that in most
cases they showed their abilities
when they had to; that is, when
(lie first-stringer was injured. At
tirst, Black caused much worry,
but he advanced to the position
of making Adams' position quite
precarious.
So next year, Stanford will start
practice with not the same 12 men
of acknowledged abilities, but wilh
i 20-odd proven athletes, and many

more potential stars.
This may be the biggest factor
in keeping the Stanfords together
for their third successful year.
When the Cards' 1935 potentiali
ties are mentioned, the example is
cited of the many athletes who, in
their senior year, have eased off and
been much more ineffective than
they were in their junior year. With

for regular work in every position,
the present varsity will have an in
centive for play matching or exceed
ing that of this year.
STANFORD HONORED
ON A.P. ALL-COAST
The Associated Press choice of an
all-Coast football team gave Tiny
Thornhill's Indians quite a hand
out. Four men on the first team is
quite a distinction, and distinctively
contrary to the usual procedure, but
added to these four are five more on
the second string.
This leaves only Woody Adams
and Buck Van Dellen without the
first or second honor. Adams, who
was given honorable mention, was
injured during much of the season
arid Bob Black played enough to
divide the selectors' attention. Van
Dellen, who alternated with Bob
Maentz all year, was in the same
position. —Browne.
ONCE JUST A FEW;
NOW CARDS HAVE MANY
Stanford's starting line-up in the
Big Game was almost exactly the
same that ran through signal drill
on the first day of practice in Sep
tember. That is somewhat signifi
cant. .
But in September, the Indians had
only twelve proved football play
ers—Monk Moscrip, Bob Reynolds,
Woody Adams, Wes Muller, Larry
Rouble, Claude Callaway, Keith
Topping, Frank Alustiza, Bones
Hamilton, Bobby Grayson, Buck
Van Dellen, and Bob Maentz.
Stanford was in had shape from
the reserve standpoint. Ail of the
city journals guffed about how the
Indians would be fine until one of
the regulars was injured, and then
would they do for substitutes?
But gradually, as the season pro
gressed these positions were filled
in and now there are reserves at
every position that come up into
almost the same class as the varsity.
Stanford will not be an eleven man
team as she goes into the Rose Bowl,
but will have a well-rounded squad.
It started when Muller was in
jured and Alf Brandin and Niels
I.arsen stepped in, then Bob
Black proved himself nearly as ca
pable as Adams in the running
guard position. Jack Clark gave
early indications of his plan to
run Topping a merry race, and
last week both Alex Tronnpas and
Carl Sehott filled iu for Moscrip.
Last week, also, Stan Anderson
and Ray Todd proved capable sub
stitutes for Grayson and Alustiza.
and Gordy Head had shown himself
worthy 'of first string right half
backing when Hamilton was moved
to lull to take the temporarily-in
jured Grayson's job. Johnny Reisner
.has been going smoothly at left halt
in place of Maentz and Van Dellen.
Jack Walton, wilh lots of weight
and remarkable speed for his size,
bud shown abilities all along when
called on to replace Rouble, and Erl
Lettunich and Jack Drown are vet
erans from way back and work in
nicely when Reynolds and Calla
way are out.
