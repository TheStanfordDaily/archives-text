# Student Leaders Decide To Dodge Consideration Of Abolition
## 
### 
Not wishing lo involve itself in the
honor societies dispute, Ex Commit
tee last night decided to drop dis
cussion on the subject.
The committee decided that the
task of weeding out the useless so
cieties from the good would be too
great to undertake.
Instead, Ex Committee devoted
most of its meeting to considering
the financial aspects of the New
Theatre drive. Ben Cave, student
manager, reported that the Union
dollar could be diverted to the
Theatre Fund at the beginning of
next quarter. Action on this matter
awaits the meeting of the Union
Board of Governors later this quar
ter.
Profit-Split Idea
A few members of the Board of
Governors have expressed to Cave
, the wish that the Union .split profits
with the A.S.S.U. rather than give
(he flat sum of a dollar per student.
i With the profits made last year, this
would have meant a greater return
i to the A.S.S.U., but Cave doubted
the advisability of this, since the
New Theatre Fund will need a safe
; and sure income to meet its pay
ments, if construction is started.
If the Union dollar plan goes
, through, and the extra dollar is add
j ed to tuition, the Theatre Fund will
receive two dollars per student per
quarter, and the prospect of early
building of the New Theatre will be
brighter.
Dr. Wilbur Approves
The proposition of adding on the
Theatre dollar to tuition starting
winter quarter has been approved
by President Wilbur. It will'now be
taken up by the Board of Trustees.
Ex Committee granted ring awards
1 to the Stanford Cardinals. The rings
will be silver, cost $4.50 apiece the
first year, and $4 for succeeding
years. Willard Eisner, chairman of
the Cardinals, said in urging adop
tion of the rings: 'After graduating
you have some nice memories of the
work done on the Cardinals in your
mind, but in" case you lose your
mind —it is nice to have some award
' for memory."

Dr. Wilbur Approves
The proposition of adding on the
Theatre dollar to tuition starting
winter quarter has been approved
by President Wilbur. It will'now be
taken up by the Board of Trustees.
Ex Committee granted ring awards
1 to the Stanford Cardinals. The rings
will be silver, cost $4.50 apiece the
first year, and $4 for succeeding
years. Willard Eisner, chairman of
the Cardinals, said in urging adop
tion of the rings: 'After graduating
you have some nice memories of the
work done on the Cardinals in your
mind, but in" case you lose your
mind —it is nice to have some award
' for memory."
Circle "S" awards were allowed for
i the Stanford men who finish among
the first ten in the cross-country

Not wishing lo involve itself in the
honor societies dispute, Ex Commit
tee last night decided to drop dis
cussion on the subject.
The committee decided that the
task of weeding out the useless so
cieties from the good would be too
great to undertake.
Instead, Ex Committee devoted
most of its meeting to considering
the financial aspects of the New
Theatre drive. Ben Cave, student
manager, reported that the Union
dollar could be diverted to the
Theatre Fund at the beginning of
next quarter. Action on this matter
awaits the meeting of the Union
Board of Governors later this quar
ter.
Profit-Split Idea
A few members of the Board of
Governors have expressed to Cave
, the wish that the Union .split profits
with the A.S.S.U. rather than give
(he flat sum of a dollar per student.
i With the profits made last year, this
would have meant a greater return
i to the A.S.S.U., but Cave doubted
the advisability of this, since the
New Theatre Fund will need a safe
; and sure income to meet its pay
ments, if construction is started.
If the Union dollar plan goes
, through, and the extra dollar is add
j ed to tuition, the Theatre Fund will
receive two dollars per student per
quarter, and the prospect of early
building of the New Theatre will be
brighter.
