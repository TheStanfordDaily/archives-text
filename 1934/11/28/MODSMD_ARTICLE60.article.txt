# COACH ISSUES 30 RUGBY SUITS FOR EARLY PRACTICES
## 
### 
Approximately 30 rugby men were
issued suits yesterday by Jim Wylie,
who is conducting practice in the
absence of Harry Maloney.
With a good schedule already
filled, it is expected that many more
will turn out for the sport. The spe
cial incentive of a trip to British
Columbia for five members of the
team should draw quite a turnout.
Inasmuch as Stanford has received
the Rose Bowl bid, several rugby
stars who are out for football will
not be available until after the New
Year's game. Among these are John
Reisner, Ben Palamountain, Chuck
White, Joe Vigna, and Ray Lewis.
