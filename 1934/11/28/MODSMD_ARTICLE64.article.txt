LOS ANGELES, Nov. 27 (/P). —
Loyola's dreams of upsetting the
Bruins of U.C.L.A. in their annual
Thanksgiving Day battle took a turn
upward today. As Coach Tom Lieb
put the Lions through another stiff
practice session, announcement was
made that Howard Whalen, speedy
back, will go back into the Loyola
lineup Thursday.
Bothered by a knee injury, Whalen
was kept out of the Santa Clara and
U.S.F. games—the only games this
season in which the Lions have failed
to score.
Loyola, however, has never beaten
U.C.L.A., and the only tie in their
football relations was back in 1924.
Women's gym classes will not meet
this afternoon.
