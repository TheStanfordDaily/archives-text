# ARIZONA MENACES INDIAN SUPREMECY IN WESTERN POLO
## Thanksgiving Day Battle To Test Strength Of Card Four 
### 
Stanford's polo outfit, mythical
collegiate champions of the West last
season by virtue of two wins out
of three games against the Univer
sity of Arizona, will attempt to re
peat their championship record when
they meet the Arizona Wildcats in
Tucson tomorrow. A second game
will be played on Saturday.
Reports from Tucson indicate that
considerable interest is being evi
denced in anticipation of the coming
games. The Arizonuns, with a quar-
I tet as formidable as last year when
they whipped all opposition in the
Southwest, hope to turn the tables
j on the Indians tomorrow. They will
have the advantage of playing on
j home ground and on their own
mounts. The Stanford riders will be
forced to use strange horses.
I For the Cards the same line-up,
with the exception of Bill Rogers in
! the first contest, that faced the Wild
! cats and defeated them last year,
j will open tomorrow. Luppe Luppen
will play at No. 1. Russ Rasmussen
will handle the No. 2 position, Bill
Enemark is substituting for the vet
' eran Rogers at No. 3, while Bob Ful
lerton is scheduled to handle the
No. 4 spot.
Cal Emeis accompanied the team
and will see considerable action as
! team substitute. Lt. Haydon Y.
Grubbs, coach of the poloists, also
made the trip. Rogers expects to
fly to Tuscon from Salt' Lake, where
he has gone with a Stanford debate
team, in time to play Saturday.
