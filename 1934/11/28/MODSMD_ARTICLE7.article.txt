# "Inspired" Alumni Assist Glee Club in Gaieties Skit
## 
### 
Many Gaieties-goers wondered
who the three "inspired" alumni
were who burst into song during the
"The Farm" number presented by
the Men's Glee Club Friday night.
People sitting near them have re
ported that it was John Springer,
instructor in economics, who came
out with the "Ballad of the Roble
Maid;" that Alfred Trowbridge, as
sistant comptroller, sang the first
verse of the "Bum Bum Song;" and
that the costumed Russian wearing
the mackinaw shirt and painter's
overalls who finished the act singing
the opening verse of "Son of a Gam
bolier" was Comptroller Almon E.
