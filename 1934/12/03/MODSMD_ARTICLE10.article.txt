# 'GIVING' TITLE OF RADIO TALK
## Dr. W. P. Shephard Speaks Over KGO Tonight 
### 
"The Problem of Giving," espe-j
ciaily appropriate at this time of i
year, will be the subject of the!
Stanford University program over ]
KGO tonight at 8 o'clock. W. P.
Shephard, M.D., of the Stanford Uni- j
versify School of Medicine, will be
the speaker.
"You and I recall that when our |
mother sent a basket of food to a I
less fortunate neighbor there was !
always gratitude in abundance," Dr.!
Shephard said in an advance inter
view on the .subject of giving.
Experience Plentiful
"We are, therefore, puzzled and !
even inclined to question the mod- !
ern methods of so-called social case j
work, of lumping together in one j
amazing sum the needs of all chari- ;
table organizations under the ban
ner of the Community Chest."'
Dr. Shephard,' aside from his i
work as clinical professor of public j
health and preventive medicine, is j
the Pacific Coast welfare director of!
the Metropolitan Life Insurance l
Company, and has served for sev- j
eral years on the Executive Com- j
mittee of the San Francisco Com- j
munity Chest. His experience in j
this work has taught him those
methods of charity that will work
today. His message tonight will ap
ply equally to cities with or without i
community chests.
Present Needs Greater
The Stanford social worker agrees
that the older meihods had their
charm and that they gave a feeling
of righteousness and gratification
which is missed today. But could we
return to our community of 25 years i
ago, we should find that .the relief
burden has.grown enormously. Dr. j
Shephard will show that the modern [
well-trained staff is far superior to |
the clumsy method of days gone by. :
