How many Stanford students, |

i pictures is due in part to research !
| carried on by Senator Leland Stan- i
j ford at his stock farm ilea;* Palo |
i Alto, now ihe site of Stanford Uni- I
j versity?
In 1878 and 1879 Senator Stan
j ford, with the co-operation of an
I English photographer, Eadweard
I Muybridge, conducted a series of
j novel experiments in photographing
I the stages of the action of trotting
| horses. The results obtained through
1 ihis investigation were carefully rc
j corded and published under the,
| name, "The Horse in Motion," which
| contributed materially 1o the ad
j vancement of the cinema, at that
! time nol yet perfected.
I In order to prove to incredulous
turf-followers the value of scientific
horse breeding and of certaifi of the
senator's theories, Muybridge rigged
lup a battery of 21 cameras, placed
two feet apart and equipped with,

electro-shutters. With these he was!
able to obtain consecutive instan
taneous exposures and, eventually, a
fairly complete series of action pic
tures.
Various trotters, for which
horses the Farm was famous, were
put through the paces before the
cameras. Muybridge showed that !
these photographs could be com- '
bined in projection to give the true
appearance of motion. These pho
tographs, besides being used as a
basis on which was built the motion
picture, settled several controversies I
that had long raged among horse j
fanciers. For example, it was by;
means of this experiment that it |
was first ascertained that horses, j
when trotting, lift all four feet from j
the ground at once.
Assisting Senator Stanford and j
Muybridge with this research were i
John D. Isaacs, a mechanical engi- j
neer, who devised the electrical j
equipment, and J. D. B. Stillman, i
M.D., who analyzed the photo
graphs.
In 1929 the University placed a j
plaque in the Memorial Court com
memorating these experiments. ,

| carried on by Senator Leland Stan- i
j ford at his stock farm ilea;* Palo |
i Alto, now ihe site of Stanford Uni- I
j versity?
In 1878 and 1879 Senator Stan
j ford, with the co-operation of an
I English photographer, Eadweard
I Muybridge, conducted a series of
j novel experiments in photographing
I the stages of the action of trotting
| horses. The results obtained through
1 ihis investigation were carefully rc
j corded and published under the,
| name, "The Horse in Motion," which
| contributed materially 1o the ad
j vancement of the cinema, at that
! time nol yet perfected.
I In order to prove to incredulous
turf-followers the value of scientific
horse breeding and of certaifi of the
senator's theories, Muybridge rigged
lup a battery of 21 cameras, placed
two feet apart and equipped with,

electro-shutters. With these he was!
able to obtain consecutive instan
taneous exposures and, eventually, a
fairly complete series of action pic
tures.
Various trotters, for which
horses the Farm was famous, were
put through the paces before the
cameras. Muybridge showed that !
these photographs could be com- '
bined in projection to give the true
appearance of motion. These pho
tographs, besides being used as a
basis on which was built the motion
picture, settled several controversies I
that had long raged among horse j
fanciers. For example, it was by;
means of this experiment that it |
was first ascertained that horses, j
when trotting, lift all four feet from j
the ground at once.
