# FOOTBALL PRACTICE STARTS ANEW WITH ROSE BOWL IN SIGHT
## Indians To Work Out Today For First Time Since California Game ODDS MAY FAVOR TIDE Stanford Stars Should Be Ready for Action 
### Mort D'Evelyn 
With Alabama officially chosen as
the opposition over the week-end,
the Cards settle down thus afternoon |
to Rose Bowl preparations with their ;
first work-out since the Big Game ;
some ten days ago.
Practice sessions will be light for;
the few school weeks remaining, in- I
dicates Coach "Tiny" Thornhill, with 1
signal drill and possibly dummy j
scrimmage on tap this afternoorf. I
Following finals the Indians will I
practice on the Farm until Decern- j
ber 27, when they are scheduled to ;
head south.

The choice of Alabama as the j
East's representative was cinched |
when the Crimson Tide .swept over j
Vanderbilt on Thanksgiving Day by
a 34-0 margin. Minnesota, though
generally recognized as the strong- !
est team in the country, stood firm ;
by conference rulings which pro- j
hibit post-season games.
Alabama not only has an unde- |
feated record this season and their j
strongest eleven of all time but an
unequalled record in the Rose Bowl, j
Early odds give the Crimson Tide a |
slight edge, which is just the set-up j
that "Tiny" Thornhill and the Stan- i
ford backers want.

Thornhill is not uninitiated as to
the type of football played in the
South, having been coach at Centre
College in Kentucky. With the in
juries of Fullback Bobby Grayson
I and End Monk Moscrip improving j
rapidly and evidently certain to be:
fully healed by the first of the year, 1
Card hopes are distinctly looking up. ;
Stanford will be on the short end of j
1 the odds for the first time this year, |
which should put Thornhill's men!
lat a good psychological advantage. !
