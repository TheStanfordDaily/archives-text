# University of California Proposes "Hyde Park"
## 
### 
Out of the turmoil of recent, stu
j dent "strikes" and dissension at the
' University of California has come j
! the proposal for the establishment'
j of a "Hyde Park" on the Berkeley !
I campus.
The Daily Californian suggests j
i that several small platforms be [
| erected in Eucalyptus Grove where
: any student who felt the urge to j
! make a speech could do so. They j
j suggest that the same code of ethics !
| in effect in London's Hyde Park be j
! established at Berkeley. These are: ,
|no speaker may step down from
! the platform until he is through (to !
J prevent him from "popping" any j
I energetic heckler); no listener may:
j jump on the platform and engage in j
i fisticuffs; no egg-throwing is toler- '
ated.
Faculty objection to the plan has j
arisen because police control would
ibe involved. The same purpose j
! should be accomplished through!
regular debating societies or discus
| sion groups, according to some of 1
I the professors.
