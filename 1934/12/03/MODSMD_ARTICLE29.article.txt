# The 						1935 Season— Stanford vs. Minnesota?
## 
### 
Now thai flu* hullvhoo is all over and the
Rose Howl Committee has obtained two satis
factory opponents lor their yearly hi# show
down that way, not a lew fans look towards
the future —not January I, but next season.
Alabama and Stanford, two admittedly
lopnoleh elevens, are going to give each other
a mighty interesting afternoon in Pasadena
some thirty days hence. The competition is
keen, and nobody intends to suggest other
wise. Hut, win or lose, there are still a few
million Americans who are very anxious to*
see or hear the Indians and the Gophers
settle a very important question between a
couple of sets of sturdy goalposts.
Roth varsities boast a powerful lineup that
centers in third-year men, and both outfits will
be back in the running, when next autumn
rolls around, with approximately the same
strength.
Of course, it is impossible to think of a
meeting this year. So why couldn't the game
be played next season? A big majority of the
lirst elevens will be back, Minnesota and Stan
ford are not strangers on the gridiron, and
Stanford would welcome a continuation of
the friendly athletic relations of 1930 and
1931, when the Gophers and the Indians had
a home-and-home arrangement.
In recent years, Stanford has scheduled at
least one intersectional contest each season.
The meetings have not been particularly
timely, nor arranged with any special pur
pose in mind. Here is an opportunity for the
Hoard of Athletic Control to arrange a real
gridiron classic that would be the national
fans' bone of contention for months before
and years after it was played. A capacity
crowd is practically assured no matter where
the stadium should be.
Evidently, it is impossible that a Rig Ten
team wiil ever appear in the Rose Howl on
January 1 of any year. The Daily suggests
the next best thing, and hints that authorities
might start moving now.
