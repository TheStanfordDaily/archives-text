# Just A Few Weeks Left

That lime of the quarter when careworn,
drawn faces predominate, when library traffic
is heavy, when the lights burn long and late,
and Ihe haunting specter of examinations
looms in the not too distant future has prac
tically arrived. In short, finals are 100 damn
near.
Finals are an old, old story to those who
have been here for several years. They are a
decadent institution and vastly over-rated.
People sweat and strain for lon# hours, cram
irrelevant facts into their heads, and then
rush over to the Quad and fire them back to
the instructors before they forget, which they
promptly do.
I he same process will be repealed this year
and in succeeding years ad infinitum. Such
a criterion, often the only one, for judging a
person's scholastic ability is obviously faulty.
It proves nothing. The students know it and
I he professors know it.
.Inst exactly what can be done about it is
not quite clear. Various suggestions of one
soil or another have been made but the good
old final exam system still seems to be about
Ihe only one used.
So long as people come to college lo he
lold things and not lo learn things some basis
for measuring the number of fads retained
iniist he used. Rut it would seem that some
improvement could be made in Ihe examina
tion system to makc iI more of a true measure
of the quality of work done during I he quarter.
Perhaps Ihe stars in their courses will
someday see a reform, il not in Ibis generation
I hen in another one perhaps.
