So many letters have boon received by the
Campus Opinion department in regard to
last week's editorial condemning the Cali
fornia rooting sertion for the singing of
"The Cardinals !»«• Damned" that the Daily
Jinds no room to print the bahmee of them.
Taking both sides of the case, they either
condemn the Editor for being so prudish as
to resent public rendition of a "dirty song,"
or they are equally einphalie in 'asking that
this year's spectacle not be repeated.
For future contributors: Letters to the Edi
tor should be confined to I.~>o words and should
he siyned with the author s full name. In
structions may be included to withhold the
name from publication, but the Daily must
know the source for its own recor<ls.
