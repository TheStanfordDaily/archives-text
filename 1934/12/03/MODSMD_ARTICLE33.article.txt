AND ELLIOTT REID
Aviation is holding its place in the news today with
Charles Ulm waiting for favorable weather for his
trans-Pacific commercial charting flight from Cali
fornia to Australia and Monte Mason finishing up the
details for what promises to be an epochal non-stop
flight from Los Angeles to Tokio.
The latter trip is of particular interest to the
campus because the plane to be used was orig
inally designed by Professor Alfred Niles and
Elliott Reid of the Guggenheim laboratory. Aero
dynamic features of the plane when first con
structed were under the supervision of Professor
Reid, who built and tested a model. The struc
tural plans and stress analysis were done by Pro
fessor Niles.
The 6,400-mile trip, to be started as soon as soon
as arrangements are completed, will be the longest
flight that has ever been attempted. Because
of the particular type plane they are using, the pilot
and navigator feel confident of making their Tokio goal.
"The big feature of the plane," said Professor Niles,
"is that it is nearly, .all wings. Most airplanes have a
large fuselage which causes air resistance.'
"The new style ship is of the 'flying wing' type
and has no fuselage. Of the 55-foot wing span, all
but the center 14 feet are of wood construction.
The two booms replacing the fuselage arc also of
wood structure."
Pilot Mason and his navigator are planning on a
cruising speed over the ocean of 185 miles per hour,
as the top speed is 220. The weight of the ship when
fully loaded is 13,400 pounds. This includes the 1,156
gallons of gasoline and 53 gallons of oil to be carried.
"There have been a number of changes in the plane
since we first designed the ship," said Professor Reid.
"I do not know the details of the present flight plans."
Good performance records were received from tests
made in the Oakland and Los Angeles areas several
years ago, Professor Niles explained, and since the
fundamental design of the airplane is not changed,
good results should be gained, he believes.
"The closed cockpit and widening of it to ac
commodate both pilot and navigator are improve
ments added more recently," Niles said. "The gas
supply has taken over space formerly allotted to
freight."
Stanfordites will be watching the outcome of the
Los Angeles to Tokio flight with interest as the first
long test of the type of plane originally designed by
tv/o Farm professors.

Elliott Reid of the Guggenheim laboratory. Aero
dynamic features of the plane when first con
structed were under the supervision of Professor
Reid, who built and tested a model. The struc
tural plans and stress analysis were done by Pro
fessor Niles.
The 6,400-mile trip, to be started as soon as soon
as arrangements are completed, will be the longest
flight that has ever been attempted. Because
of the particular type plane they are using, the pilot
and navigator feel confident of making their Tokio goal.
"The big feature of the plane," said Professor Niles,
"is that it is nearly, .all wings. Most airplanes have a
large fuselage which causes air resistance.'
"The new style ship is of the 'flying wing' type
and has no fuselage. Of the 55-foot wing span, all
but the center 14 feet are of wood construction.
The two booms replacing the fuselage arc also of
wood structure."
Pilot Mason and his navigator are planning on a
cruising speed over the ocean of 185 miles per hour,
as the top speed is 220. The weight of the ship when
fully loaded is 13,400 pounds. This includes the 1,156
gallons of gasoline and 53 gallons of oil to be carried.
"There have been a number of changes in the plane
since we first designed the ship," said Professor Reid.
"I do not know the details of the present flight plans."
Good performance records were received from tests
made in the Oakland and Los Angeles areas several
years ago, Professor Niles explained, and since the
fundamental design of the airplane is not changed,
good results should be gained, he believes.
"The closed cockpit and widening of it to ac
commodate both pilot and navigator are improve
ments added more recently," Niles said. "The gas
supply has taken over space formerly allotted to
freight."
Stanfordites will be watching the outcome of the
Los Angeles to Tokio flight with interest as the first
long test of the type of plane originally designed by
tv/o Farm professors.
WITH PROFESSORS ALFRED NILES
AND ELLIOTT REID
Aviation is holding its place in the news today with
Charles Ulm waiting for favorable weather for his
trans-Pacific commercial charting flight from Cali
fornia to Australia and Monte Mason finishing up the
details for what promises to be an epochal non-stop
flight from Los Angeles to Tokio.
The latter trip is of particular interest to the
campus because the plane to be used was orig
inally designed by Professor Alfred Niles and
Elliott Reid of the Guggenheim laboratory. Aero
dynamic features of the plane when first con
structed were under the supervision of Professor
Reid, who built and tested a model. The struc
tural plans and stress analysis were done by Pro
fessor Niles.
