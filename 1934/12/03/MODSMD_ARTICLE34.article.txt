# SINLESS SALT LAKE
## 
### 
SALT LAKE CITY, Nov. 30.—Across the snow
covered Wasatch Mountains from the iniquitous dens
of Reno lies sinless Salt Lake, scintillating in its
saline purity.
The Mormons came here in 1847 to get away from
the people of Illinois who didn't like that sort of thing.
They were well settled before they got wise to the fact
that the lake was of salt water. But by that time it
was too late to move on, for Brigham Young received
a vision from the Lord saying that "This Is the Place,"
and he couldn't go back on his vision.
In the good old days Brigham Young had 19 wives,
and a mere bigamist was considered a piker. At pres
ent, however, the Mormon Church officially frowns on
polygamy, and one woman per one man is the hard
and fast rule. Occasionally, however, little fanciful
touches creep into the Salt Lake press, such r.s this:
"Mr. X will climax his Thanksgiving day at a
dinner tonight with 70 members of his immediate
family."
University of Utah students like to feel they were
the first "Indians," and feel certain that Stanford pi
rated the colors "red and white." Yet despite such
vanity, the Utes are nice people.
U. of U. students dress far better than we do
at Stanford. A Utah "rough" would make a Stan
ford "smoothie" feel almost virile. University of
Utah women are beautiful, and do not smoke or
drink coffee. It is not just one or two—but dozens
of them—gorgeous, smokeless, and drinkless; and
far more enjoyable than a Kaywoodie pipe.
Yet despite their fine clothes and moral ways, Utah
men and women are more rooty-toot-toot and rah-rah
than the Stanford Indian and Indian maid. Their engi
neers not only have hairy ears as the songs says, but
they paint the sidewalks with all manner of "col
legiate" stuff before football games. Before the Thanks
giving Day game with the Utah Aggies, the U. of U.
boys slopped literally buckets and buckets of led and
white paint through the business section of <he town
(and, unlike Palo Alto, Salt Lake is a city of 160,000).
Co-eds actually wear their "spurs," society honorary
sweaters, white things with a gaudy red emblem; and
this not only for football games. They apparently are
untroubled by the modesty that keeps Stanford rally
?irl sweaters rolled in mothballs.
As far as taxation is concerned. Utah is one
half of I per cent better than California—their
state sales tax being but 2 per cent. As far as
liquor is concerned Utah (not the university) is
officially about 15 per rent worse than California
—prohibition still holding sway on the statute
books; .1.2 beer the legal maximum. Actually, of
course, everything is sold, and quite openly; alco
holic beverages being dispensed in the most re
spectable clubs.
Salt Lake's official naivete in re liquor cxeeeds
even that found on the Farm. A high official of the
Mormon Church told a gathering of brethren he was
>ure prohibition was a success in Salt Lake, for at
the Utah Hotel more ginger-ale was being sold than
any other drink.
Salt Lake is homesy, folksy; everyone is related to
everyone else, and everyone else is related to Brigham
Young. It is one of the few American cities with u
definite character and heritage.

men and women are more rooty-toot-toot and rah-rah

SALT LAKE CITY, Nov. 30.—Across the snow
covered Wasatch Mountains from the iniquitous dens
of Reno lies sinless Salt Lake, scintillating in its
saline purity.
The Mormons came here in 1847 to get away from
the people of Illinois who didn't like that sort of thing.
They were well settled before they got wise to the fact
that the lake was of salt water. But by that time it
was too late to move on, for Brigham Young received
a vision from the Lord saying that "This Is the Place,"
and he couldn't go back on his vision.
In the good old days Brigham Young had 19 wives,
and a mere bigamist was considered a piker. At pres
ent, however, the Mormon Church officially frowns on
polygamy, and one woman per one man is the hard
and fast rule. Occasionally, however, little fanciful
touches creep into the Salt Lake press, such r.s this:
"Mr. X will climax his Thanksgiving day at a
dinner tonight with 70 members of his immediate
family."
University of Utah students like to feel they were
the first "Indians," and feel certain that Stanford pi
rated the colors "red and white." Yet despite such
vanity, the Utes are nice people.
U. of U. students dress far better than we do
at Stanford. A Utah "rough" would make a Stan
ford "smoothie" feel almost virile. University of
Utah women are beautiful, and do not smoke or
drink coffee. It is not just one or two—but dozens
