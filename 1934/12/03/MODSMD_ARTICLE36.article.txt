The Editor, Sir:
Several grievances bestir Ihe old j
typewriter to ihe boiling point.!
Steam arises in four places and is j
let off in the following manner:
1. More power to those jolly cam
pus cops who hand tickets to fellows'
who park on the newly constructed t
sidewalk from Encina to the engi- j
neering corner. The most harrassed
individual, the pedestrian, must reel |
around like a drunken sailor in a j
typhoon to avoid steering straight
into nine or ten members of the |
four-wheeled family. I was under i
the impression the sidewalk was put!
there to walk on and not to furnish i
parking space.
2. Who said hats are "out" on the
Stanford campus? To say that not j
many men wear hats is 0.K., but i
to dub hats as' "out" is a dirty !
thrust straight up the snoot of com- j
mon sense. Anybody who would j
wander around in these recent rains I
without a hat is merely using his j
head for a sponge and should bei
chucked in the loony bin.
3. This year there are more golfers
and would-be golfers on the Stan
ford campus than ever before. The j
pedestrian element must crop up
again. Many golfers are without
cars. It is a 40-minute round trip
on foot out to the course and back, j

That is quite a waste of time, en
ergy, and shoe leather.. Why cannot
a practice field and possibly a green
be erected at least a mile nearer
the campus? Or give the men cer
tain times when they could play
on the women's practice field.
Doggoned if I didn't forget the
fourth one, but I'll bet I could have
made some nasty cracks.

The Editor, Sir:
Few more than the five hundred
and some Stanford men who play
intra-mural touch football know
what a really swell game it is.
Should not a Stanford spoj-t that
affords competition between such a
large number of teams and individ
uals be given more recognition than
it now receives?
The attention of Intra - mural
Sports Manager Marvie Kahn and
the B.A.C. is drawn to this sugges
tion that a game between the Stan
ford championship team and the best
touch football team at the University
of California be arranged.
Why not have it played as a pre
liminary to the Big Game, when so
many of the early comers wait two
or three hours with nothing to oc
cupy their attention?

3. This year there are more golfers
and would-be golfers on the Stan
ford campus than ever before. The j
pedestrian element must crop up
again. Many golfers are without
cars. It is a 40-minute round trip
on foot out to the course and back, j

That is quite a waste of time, en
ergy, and shoe leather.. Why cannot
a practice field and possibly a green
be erected at least a mile nearer
the campus? Or give the men cer
tain times when they could play
on the women's practice field.
Doggoned if I didn't forget the
fourth one, but I'll bet I could have
made some nasty cracks.

The Editor, Sir:
Few more than the five hundred
and some Stanford men who play
intra-mural touch football know
what a really swell game it is.
Should not a Stanford spoj-t that
affords competition between such a
large number of teams and individ
uals be given more recognition than
it now receives?
The attention of Intra - mural
Sports Manager Marvie Kahn and
the B.A.C. is drawn to this sugges
tion that a game between the Stan
ford championship team and the best
touch football team at the University
of California be arranged.
Why not have it played as a pre
liminary to the Big Game, when so
many of the early comers wait two
or three hours with nothing to oc
cupy their attention?

The Editor, Sir:
Several grievances bestir Ihe old j
typewriter to ihe boiling point.!
Steam arises in four places and is j
let off in the following manner:
1. More power to those jolly cam
pus cops who hand tickets to fellows'
who park on the newly constructed t
sidewalk from Encina to the engi- j
neering corner. The most harrassed
individual, the pedestrian, must reel |
around like a drunken sailor in a j
typhoon to avoid steering straight
into nine or ten members of the |
four-wheeled family. I was under i
the impression the sidewalk was put!
there to walk on and not to furnish i
parking space.
2. Who said hats are "out" on the
Stanford campus? To say that not j
many men wear hats is 0.K., but i
to dub hats as' "out" is a dirty !
thrust straight up the snoot of com- j
mon sense. Anybody who would j
wander around in these recent rains I
without a hat is merely using his j
head for a sponge and should bei
chucked in the loony bin.
