# Largest Astronomical Eye Poured in Record Time
## 
### 
CORNING. N.Y.. Dec. 2 (TP).â€”The
second 200-inch mirror for the
world's greatest telescope, the as
tronomical eye that will see one
million times better than a human j
eye, was poured without a single j
apparent flaw at the Corning Glass
Works today.
The time was record-breaking,
six hours and 53 minutes, for 20 i
tons of molten glass, ladled out in I
104 huge gobs that fairly scorched i
the faces of spectators and scientists j
who encircled the great pouring
room. The time was nearly twice the
speed of pouring the first "eye" here
last March.
