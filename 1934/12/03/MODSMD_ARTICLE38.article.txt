### 
BUENOS AIRES, Dec. 2 (/Phâ€”
Strategic struggles between Para- \
guayan attackers and Bolivian de- i
fenders in the Pilcomayo River sec- i
tor were reported under way today.
Conditions were described lit re as
similar to those which preceded the j
Paraguayan victories last month in
Canada El Carmen. The Para
guayans were reported pushing
toward Cururenda and Dorbigny
with the hope of pushing the Bo
livians back to Villamonte, west of
the 63rd meridian.
The Prussian guards, pet soldiers
of former German kaisers, had to j
stand seven feet in their stocking j
feet.
