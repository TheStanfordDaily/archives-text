# L. A. Railway Men Hope For Quick Settlement
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES. Dec. 2 (JP).â€”With
violence less in evidence, and hope
higher for a settlement, the strike
of union employes of the Los Angeles
Railway moved into its second week
today as street cars, manned by non
union men, continued operating "on
schedule."
In contrast to past nights, which
have seen the overturning and burn
ing of street cars, the only disturb
ances of the last 24 hours occurred
in the downtown district at dusk
when police on two occasions used
tear gas bombs to break up crowds
of strike sympathizers which milled
about street cars.
