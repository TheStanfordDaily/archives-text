"STUDENT TOUR"
At the Varsity Theatre
When a picture opens with an [
entire university student body j
boarding an ocean liner and prepar
ing to accompany its varsity crew on \
a world tour, it needs only Charles)
Butterworth as a doddering piofes
sor of philosophy and Jimmy Du
rante as crew trainer to be complete, j
"Student Tour" is complete. How
ever, despite such drawbacks as
trite dialogue (Durante's nose is
likened to Mount Everest) and a
background of pretty coeds (this is
not "sour grapes"), it also manages
to be funny throughout. Of interest
to Stanford students is the appear
ance in this production of Mary
Anita Loos,» former campus stage
star, as one of the pretty coeds.
"WHEN A MAN SEES RED"
Also at the Varsity
This picture, too, should be of'
special interest to local theatre
goers, not because it presents a
campus actress (see above), but be- |
cause its scene is laid in a nearby j

town. Or so we
are led to be- j
lieve when the j
heroine an-;
nounces her in-i
tention to give
up painting in |
New York and j
go west to Los |

Gatos to manage a ranch left, her by
an uncle. The fact that Los Gatos
proves to consist of a frame rail
road station and a hitching-post is ;
a bit misleading, but then, how can 1
Buck Jones continue to make wild
west pictures if there is no longer j
any wild west? —B. Sweet.
