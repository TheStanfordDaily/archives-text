REYNOLDS ALL-AMERICAN
CHOICE IS SURPRISE

Over the week-end ihe annual j
picking of all-American elevens
gained momentum with ihe pub- j
fishing of the Associated Press, the I
United Press, and the New York Sun
teams, which included some mild 1
surprises as far as Coast and Stan- I
ford followers were concerned.
Chief among these was the name !
of Bob Reynolds on the A'-sociated j
Press first team. The reams of pub- '
licity distributed on a nation-wide 1
scale oii front sport pages from Sep- j
temfoer through November, a recog- j
nized requisite for ail-American i
candidates, has not been received ,
by Reynolds.
What undoubtedly did give the!
220-pound, 6 foot 4 inch Card a j
distinct advantage over most tackles
in the country was his service on the j
kickoffs, and his consistent 55 or 60- J
yard kicks. Furthermore, opponents |
hnve rated Reynolds among the best j
«lackles 111. v y have faced. Finally, j
when his record for time played and !
his ability to stand poundings Sat
urday after Saturday without in- |
jury, Reynolds' name on first all-
Amevican teams cannot be so un- i
expected after all.

MOSC RIP'S KNEE INJURY
HURTS CHANCES

The factor- which kept Monk Mos- i
crip oil the first elevens of these early i
selections was the knee injury which
kept him out of the Coast's biggest !
game of the season two Saturday's ;
ago. Despite this handicap, Moscrip
is almost certain to be named on j
several of the many all-American 1
teams yet to be chosen, and certainly j
has an inside track on one all- j
American end post for his senior I
year.
In fact, Card fans can look for
ward to 1935 choices with optimistic
smiles of self-satisfaction, what with
three juniors making the majority of
the teams this year and others of
such calibre as Bob Hamilton, Claude
Callaway, and Larry Rouble still
without recognition.

SIX ALL-AMERICANS
IN 1 ROSE HOWL

All-American choices arc inci- ;
dentally providing a natural build- i
up for the Rose Bowl game, already j
anticipated by both participants and

classed as a "natural" by sport |
writers.
Aside from the aforementioned |
all-Americans among the Indian
starters, Alabama has three men who '
are making places on first or second
nation-wide selections. There will
undoubtedly be more all-Americans
playing for the Rose Bowl than in
any other single contest this year.
Bill Lee, tackle, Don Hutson, end, j
and Millard Howell, half, will play i
football of all-American calibre fori
Ihe Crimson Tide. Alabama will be I
far from the pitied Columbia on next
January 1!
