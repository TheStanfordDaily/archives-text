# REYNOLDS AND GRAYSON RATE A.P. ALL-AMERICAN
## 
### (By the Associated Press 
As seemingly befits the perform- j
ances of three outstanding unde- j
feated college football teams of the 1
1934 season, the individual stars of :
Minnesota, Alabama and Stanford
capture the major portion of all-
American honors awarded today in
the annual Associated Press con
sensus selections.
Each of those tremendously pow
erful aggregations dominant in
their own gridiron bailiwicks, gain
two places on the all-star eleven. I
The remaining five positions go to
individual heroes of North Carolina,
Rice, Texas Christian, Pittsburgh,
and Navy after one of the keenest ;
battles ever waged for membership j
on the football roll of honor.
Bob Reynolds at tackle and Bobby |
Grayson at quarterback, both of i
Stanford, were the West's only of- |
ferings to the first team.
The battlQ for end positions was j
won by Minnesota's rangy Frank j
Larson and Alabama's brilliant Don ;
Hutson, only after a close three- |
cornered race in which James i
(Monk) Moscrip, Stanford junior, '
supplied the chief opposition. Mos
crip outranked all the ends on the ]
West Coast by a wide margin, but j
was claimed to lack the experience |
of Hutson and Larson.
