BUENOS AIRES, Dec. 2 (/P). â€” j
Primo Camera, former heavyweight i
champion of the world, won a bout |
over Victorio Campolo, Argentine j
fighter, who is only a shade smaller |
than himself, yesterday.
Thirty thousand people Hied into ;
the huge football stadium, many '
failing to come because rumor said !
Campolo was far over fighting J
weight. After 12 tame rounds. Car- j
nera won the decision, but Cam- |
polo amazed the South American j
gallery who expected that after two |
years out of the ring the southerner I
would be stale.
