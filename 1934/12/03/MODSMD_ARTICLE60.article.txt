# Strange Man-Brute Friendship Ends in Two Deaths at Zoo
## 
### 
"Finis" has been written by a
double death and perhaps a third,
to one of the most dramatic episodes
in the annals of zoo history.
It all happened this last week in
San Francisco when "Ginger," famed
Fleishhacker zoo orang-outang, was
maliciously poisoned by a visitor
who gave him a stick of candy con
taining a lethal ingredient. The huge
simian was known far and wide, and
was valued at $5,000.
Jack Bamberger, the keeper of the
anthropoid, was so attached to the
animal that when he heard of the
calamity the shock proved too much.
He collapsed upon hearing the news
and shortly afterward died.
The superintendent of Fleishhacker
zoo, George Bistany, was also over
whelmed at the loss of his prize pet,
which he brought from Sumatra six
years ago. He was taken to the Uni
versity of California hospital in a
critical state. The bond of attach
ment which had grown between the
park chief and the 200-pound orang
outang was nothing short of remark
able. The ape would perform tricks
or cut up capers at the behest of
Bistany and his antics amused many
a large crowd.
Ginger saved Bistany's life once
when he was attacked by another
ape, and administered upon the
other anthropoid a severe beating.
The University of California an
thropology museum will mount the
skin of the simian. No one but
keepers will be allowed to feed the
animals in the future, as a result of
Ginger's death.
