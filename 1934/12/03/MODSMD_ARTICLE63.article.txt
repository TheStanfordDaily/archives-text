# Court Refuses To Rehear Mayfield Liquor Decree
## 
### 
Considering its first order as final,
the California Supreme Court Thurs
day refused a rehearing of its decree
that the liquor license of the Cali
fornia Avenue Pharmacy in Mayfield
be cancelled.
The court's previous decision, is
sued on November 2, was made on
the grounds that the pharmacy was
within the zone surround
ing the Stanford campus, and thus
was subject to the rule that no in
toxicating beverages be sold within
that limit.
