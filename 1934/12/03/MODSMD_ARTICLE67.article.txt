# Navy Downs Army 3-0 After Long 13-Year Jinx
## 
### 
PHILADELPHIA, Dec. 2 j
ter 13 years of dominance, Navy
| crashed through yesterday to win
j over West Point, 3-0.
Eighty thousand people saw the
j battle, one of the closest and hardest
j fought in many years of rivalry,
j Finally, a placement kick by Slade 1
i Cutter, from the 19-yard line, meant
the margin of victory for Navy.
Rain turned the field into a sea
! of mud, and Army could du little
j on its own, while Navy tried one 1
I forward pass all afternoon, which
! was intercepted.
Fred Borries, all-American Navy .
i ball-carrier, played a stand-out
! gi.me for Navy, as did the remainder
I of an inspired Annapolis team.
