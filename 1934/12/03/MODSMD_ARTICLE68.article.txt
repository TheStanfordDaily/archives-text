BERLIN, Dec. 2 (/P).—Through a
j tremendous "back to the soil" move
! ment, Nazi Germany is progressing
i toward a fuller measure of protec
| tion in a military sense as well as
j economically, it was reliably stated
i today.
"By settling thousands of young
■ men on small farms or subsistence
| projects, particularly along the
j border, Germany is putting at pos-
I sibly critical points many who could
i be called, to arms in a few hours,
! well-conditioned men disciplined in
I military knowledge," declared a
I trustworthy informant.

Bureau of Forestry statistics .state
that the average life of a tree is
between 200 and 300 years.
