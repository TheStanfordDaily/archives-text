# PROPOSED TILT WITH GOPHERS HELD UNLIKELY
## Many Difficulties Loom In Way of Intersectional football Tilt MINNESOTA SAYS 'NO' Daily's Proposal Not Likely To Materialize 
### 
Unless Board of Athlelic Control
officials change their minds within
the next; week, The Daily's proposed
Stanford - Minnesota football game
during the regular 1935 season will
not materialize.
Tliis was indicated in a general
sounding of opinion following the
Daily editorial advocating (lie in
tersectional clash for next year's
schedule yesterday.
While united in their belief that
the game would be one of the best
possible drawing cards, leaders in

Stanford football could see no feas
ible way in which the two could get
together in their schedules.
No Mid-Season Game
The objection raised by Alfred R.
Masters, general manager of the
BA.C., and again by Coach "Tiny"
Thornhill was that the game would
have to be played during the middle
ol the season in order to get around
the Big Ten ruling, which affects
Minnesota, barring post - season
games.
This would necessitate a trip for
one team or the other, and in the
event ol a home-and-home arrange
ment a trip for each, during the reg
ular schedule, thus killing two or
two and one-half weeks of practice
when the respective squads need it
most.
Practice Time Lost
Thornhill said, "I don't want to
take a trip like the Northwestern
jaunt of last year, which cost us so
much practice time; that's the only
objection I would have to the pro
posed game. It would be all right if
it were the Saturday after the Big
Game. 3ut; Minnesota finishes her
Big Ten schedule at the same time
we play California, and the follow
ing week would classify as post
season. •
"Of course, an early-season trip
next year would be different from
that of 1932, because we were build
ing an inexperienced sophomore
team then. But it would work a
handicap, and I don't believe Min
nesota would consent to it any more
than we would," "Tiny" continued.
Masters reiterated this same
opinion, and indicated the game
could not be seriously considered.
Student sentiment was a bit more
favorable to the plan.
Bones Hamilton, acting captain of
the Indians during the Big Game,
in speaking for the team, said: "I
think it would be a good idea. We
probably will play some intersec
tional game next year, and we nat
urally want to meet the best; it looks
like Minnesota will be that team."
"Biggest Drawing Card" •
"It would be the biggest drawing
card we could get, and Stanford is
entitled to some eastern trip next
year. It wouldn't be the best thing
to travel in the middle of the season,
but it would be fine if the Minne
sota. content could be arranged after
the Big Game. If that is possible, I
prefer a post-season trip to New
York to meet Princeton," was the
comment of Chuck White, student
member of the BA.C. and reserve
halfback on the Cardinal team.
Drawing Card Game
Stan Anderson, co-hero" of the
Fig Game and another student mem
ber of the board, expressed the same
opinion, seemingly convinced of the
impracticability of the proposed
game, yet admitting it would be the
ideal drawing card.
The home-and-home arrangement
that would b.' almost necessary in
order to secure the Minnesota con
sent was another drawback cited by
those interviewed. The fact that by
l!) 36 one or the other of the teams
may drop in national prestige damp
ened the officials' enthusiasm en '.his
score.
