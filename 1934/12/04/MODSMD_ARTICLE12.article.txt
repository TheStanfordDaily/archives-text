Paul White, bus driver of Harrison, Pennsylvania, gave police one of
their first definite clues before the bodies of three little girls found in
the woods near Carlysle, Pa., were identified. White said the girls,
accompanied by a woman, had ridden on his bus and identified the body
of Winifred Pierson as the person. Her body was found with that of
Elmo Noakes, while the three little girls were Noakes' daughters.
