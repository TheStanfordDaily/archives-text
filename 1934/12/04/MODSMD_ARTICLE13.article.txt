# U. S. RELATIONS IS TALK TOPIC
## League Authority To Speak At Lecture Tonight 
### 
Clark M. Eichelberger, national
director of the League of Nations
Association, will speak at 7:30 o'clock
in the Assembly Hall tonight on
"American Responsibility and Self
interest in World Affairs."
A recognized authority on inter
national problems, Eichelberger vis
ited in the bay region last spring,
speaking in San Francisco before
the Commonwealth Club at one of
its regular Friday luncheon meetings.
Long Study in Europe
After serving with the American
Expeditionary Forces in Franco dur
ing the World War, Eichelberger re
turned to Europe in 1923 for an
exhaustive study of reconstruction in
nine countries there. After spending
several months at the seat of the
League of Nations, he returned to
this country on a lecture tour, con
vinced that the United States should
take its full place in the community
of nations.
Attends League Regularly
An annual visitor at the League,
Eichelberger has attended practically
every session of the Assembly. He
was present when the Sino-Japanese
dispute was brought before the
Council, visited Geneva in 1933 when
Germany resigned from the League
and the Disarmament Conference,
and was again present in 1934, at
the 15th Assembly, when Soviet
Russia entered the League of Na
tions.
Alert and cognizant of public opin
ion trends in world affairs, intimately
acquainted with government leaders
in the United States and Europe,
Eichelberger is an accepted authority
on international affairs as related to
American policies.
