# Warns of 'C' Average Upper Division Rule
## 
### 
Attention was called â– yesterday by !
Registrar J. P. Mitchell to the ruling
passed last June by the Academic J
Council requiring a "C" average on !
work done in the lower division for j
entrance to the upper division.
Formerly a student could enter the
upper division without this average,
but the new rule was made after it
was decided to abolish flunking in
ihe upper division. The new regu
lation is designed to insure that all \
upper division students shall be adc- 1
quate scholars.
