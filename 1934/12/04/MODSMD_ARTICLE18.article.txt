# Girlish Figures Vanish At Farm, Co-eds Find

### SUZANNE HAMMOND 
Whether-or not the average coed'
has come to Stanford merely for the
pursuance of higher learning has
long been a source of great contro
versy, but one thing is known as a I
certain fact: the Farm is no place
for the gal who wishes to m; intain
her youthful figure!
Survey has shown that every
liable woman consumes as many j
potatoes as (he heftiest football
player; to lie exact, she eats one
whole sack of the tubers yearly.
The women fall behind, however,
when it comes to milk drinking. En
ein;i leads in this field with a record
of 80 lo 100 gallons daily. By rough
compulation this means that each!
man has one full quart of mill: every
day to his credit. Their femah< com
petitors manage to down a scant pint ;
a day.
Encina. liable, Lagunita, and Un- i

ion all consume approximately the
same amounts of coffee, namely six
pounds per person yearly, which
proves that both men and women
have an equal caffeine stimulation of
an evening to stay awake with bor
ing companions.
In addition to these appetite
phenomena of Stanfordites, survey
shows that the ice cream plant at
the Union makes enough ice cream
and sherbet yearly to supply
every man, woman, and child on
the campus with 120 fat ice cream
cones during the period while col
lege is in session — one every day,
to be still more exact.
And, of course, aside from this, all
kinds of punch and fancy ice cream
are consumed at parties; and nearly
2,500 gallons of syrup are spread in
gooey masses across the surface of
the afore-mentioned ice cream.
