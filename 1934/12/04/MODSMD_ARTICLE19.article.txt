# Indians, Fired By 'Underdog' Rumor, Resume Workouts
## Several First Stringers Not On Field as Thornhill Runs Signal Drill 
### Millard Browne 
The Stanford football team was I
ju.st a shadow of its former .self as i
it convened for the first time yester- I
day afternoon since the Big Game j
for purposes of physical pi-actice. ;
What with the California game and j
final examinations, the first string j
that lined up to run through a few i
new and many old plays under j
guidance of Coach "Tiny" Thornhill j
was scarcely recognizable.
The players who were there, j
however, were serious in intent, ;
and gave every impression that j
they were quite some enthused j
about a little matter to be settled j
with Alabama in Pasadena's Rose j
Bowl on New Year's Day.
Yep, the Indians have heard ru
mors that they will be underdogs
when they meet the representa
tives of the "ol' South," and they
have quite taken to the idea.
Here's the way the first string
lined up, and it didn't look exactly
according to Hoyle:
Ends: Carlos Monsalve and Alex
Trompas; tackles, Bob Reynolds and !
Claude Callaway; guards, Larry
Rouble and Woody Adams; center,
Wes Muller; backs, Frank Aiustiza,
Bones Hamilton, Stan Anderson, and
Johnny Reisner.
It was just right except in the ends :
and backfield.
Monk Moscrip and Keith Top- i
ping, better known at the flank !
work, are still recuperating from j
knee injuries. Dr. Fritz Roth an- '
nouneed definitely that both will
be able to play, but they will not j
work out until late in the month. j
Bobby Grayson, all - American
fullback who was injured in the
Bear game, will be well within a
week, Roth opined, and will resume
work in the position temporarily
held by Anderson.
Unexplained absences were chalk
ed up for Buck Van Dellen and Bob
Maentz, left half alternates, and
Jack Walton, second string guard, j
For the sake of convenience and j
because there are no known inju- j
l ies in these sources, these absentees j
were accredited to approaching'
finals.
Stanford is still worrying about !
this year, and entire concentra
tion during the next three weeks
will be on the Crimson Tide game,
but Thornhill gave indication he j
is thinking in terms of 1935 at J
least a little bit, as lie shuffled 1
his reserves slightly.
Nils Larsen, alternate with Muller j
and Alf Brandin in the center role, I
was working at tackle during part of I
the afternoon. The reason: Jack
Drown and Ed Lettunich, second j
stringers, will be graduated and i
leave gaping apertures in the reserve |
tackle forces, whereas Muller and j
Brandin .will be back to do right by]
the center post. Larsen is big and
may do more good as a second
siring tackle next year than as a;
third string center.
Practice Wednesday, Friday
Thornhill will drill his men again J
Wednesday and Friday, with prac- |
tice being more or Jess voluntary!
until after finals. Indications were
that the squad on the whole is well
up in studies ,and the Indian work
outs probably will not suffer greatly
in the wake of book learning.

Brandin .will be back to do right by]
the center post. Larsen is big and
may do more good as a second
siring tackle next year than as a;
third string center.
Practice Wednesday, Friday
Thornhill will drill his men again J
Wednesday and Friday, with prac- |
tice being more or Jess voluntary!
until after finals. Indications were
that the squad on the whole is well
up in studies ,and the Indian work
outs probably will not suffer greatly
in the wake of book learning.
The Stanford football team was I
ju.st a shadow of its former .self as i
it convened for the first time yester- I
day afternoon since the Big Game j
for purposes of physical pi-actice. ;
What with the California game and j
final examinations, the first string j
that lined up to run through a few i
new and many old plays under j
guidance of Coach "Tiny" Thornhill j
was scarcely recognizable.
The players who were there, j
however, were serious in intent, ;
and gave every impression that j
they were quite some enthused j
about a little matter to be settled j
with Alabama in Pasadena's Rose j
Bowl on New Year's Day.
Yep, the Indians have heard ru
mors that they will be underdogs
when they meet the representa
tives of the "ol' South," and they
have quite taken to the idea.
Here's the way the first string
lined up, and it didn't look exactly
according to Hoyle:
Ends: Carlos Monsalve and Alex
Trompas; tackles, Bob Reynolds and !
Claude Callaway; guards, Larry
Rouble and Woody Adams; center,
Wes Muller; backs, Frank Aiustiza,
Bones Hamilton, Stan Anderson, and
Johnny Reisner.
It was just right except in the ends :
and backfield.
Monk Moscrip and Keith Top- i
ping, better known at the flank !
work, are still recuperating from j
knee injuries. Dr. Fritz Roth an- '
nouneed definitely that both will
be able to play, but they will not j
work out until late in the month. j
Bobby Grayson, all - American
fullback who was injured in the
Bear game, will be well within a
week, Roth opined, and will resume
work in the position temporarily
held by Anderson.
Unexplained absences were chalk
ed up for Buck Van Dellen and Bob
Maentz, left half alternates, and
Jack Walton, second string guard, j
For the sake of convenience and j
because there are no known inju- j
l ies in these sources, these absentees j
were accredited to approaching'
finals.
Stanford is still worrying about !
this year, and entire concentra
tion during the next three weeks
will be on the Crimson Tide game,
but Thornhill gave indication he j
is thinking in terms of 1935 at J
least a little bit, as lie shuffled 1
his reserves slightly.
Nils Larsen, alternate with Muller j
and Alf Brandin in the center role, I
was working at tackle during part of I
the afternoon. The reason: Jack
Drown and Ed Lettunich, second j
stringers, will be graduated and i
leave gaping apertures in the reserve |
tackle forces, whereas Muller and j
Brandin .will be back to do right by]
the center post. Larsen is big and
may do more good as a second
siring tackle next year than as a;
third string center.
