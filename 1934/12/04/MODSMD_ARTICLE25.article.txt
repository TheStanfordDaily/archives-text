# GAVE HINTS AT EX COMMITTEE SURPRISE MOVE
## Ideas for New Theatre Will Furnish Principal Topic For Discussion FINANCES ARE PROBLEM Plans Indicate Construction Beginning in June 
### 
A.S.S.U. President Marvie Kahn
expects a calm and peaceful Ex
Committee meeting tonight, but
Student Manager Ben Cave may
make a surprise move and upset Un
expected tranquillity.
Cave hints darkly tliat he is
going to bring up some proposition
and refuses to divulge the nature
of its contents.
Ex Committee started a plan re
cently whereby propositions com
ing before Ex Committee would
bo submitted to Kahn the day before
Ex Committee meeting, so that the
business coming before the group
could appear in The Daily before the
meeting. The plan was started as a
convenience to Ex Committee, but
Cave says he is afraid that the reve
lation of his plot would upset his
well-laid plans.
Kahn has on his schedule for to
night's meeting only the subject of
Ihe New Theatre, which he dees not
expect will evoke any involved dis
cussion.
Consideration of New Theatre
problems will consist of a report
by Kalui on the progress of the
Theatre Committee. The student
body's part in financing the struc
ture is still the cause for concern
of the Theatre Committee, Kahn
reported to The Daily yesterday.
The present plans center on the
proposal to divert the Union Dollar
into the Theatre Fund, according to
Kahn. He expects action t n this
proposition when the Union Board
of Governors meet at the beginning
of next quarter.
If all financial plans of ihe com
mittee are perfected in the near fu
ture, the beginning of the construc
tion on the New Theatre is expected
by next June.
