MOSCOW, Dec. 3 (VP).--Thirty
nine "white guards from the Lenin
grad region and 32 others from the
Moscow area were arrested tonight
and charged with preparation of ter
roristic acts against officials of the
U.S.S.R., presumably in connection
with the assassination of Sergei
Kiroff, secretary of the ccntral exec
utive committee.
The arrests followed the central
committee's decree invoking anew
the death penalty for Russian ter
rorists and providing swift trial and
prompt execution of penalties, with
no appeal from death sentences.
In addition to the arrests, the
chief of administration of the com
missariat of home affairs at Lenin
grad, named Medvied, together with
six of his responsible assistants was
removed from office for negligence
in safeguarding the state's security.
It was announced the "white
guards" will be tried by a military
collegium of the Supreme Court.
Medvied and his assistant also are
to face trial.
