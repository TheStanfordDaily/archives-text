# Poor Cal's Rally Committee Stooged for the NRA
## 
### 
Over 70,000 people stood up to stretch, eat
peanuts, and throw the shells down the neck
of the nearest cash customer. II was half-time
at the Big (lame, and the California rooting
section was putting on some mighty good card
stunts. There was a particularly outstanding
one for Navy Bill; another followed that com
plimented the visiting Indians. Fans ap
plauded and awaited the next offering. It
came.
A gigantic blue eagle spread itself across
the expansive Berkeley section, and seemed
to tell everybody that the National Recovery
Administration was what you and I ought to
love, honor, etc. According to calculations,
70,000 cheering maniacs should have howled
a vociferous cheer for the NBA and all that
il stands for.
Somehow or other, nothing happened.
Somebody started to bang his hands together
very noticeably, until nearby stares brought
an abrupt hall to Ibis show of enthusiasm.
A mild wave of applause might have started,
but nobody heard it. A moment of embar
rassing silence, and the bewildered eagle
folded in peace.
The above is of special interest to Stanford's
own Bally Committee, which had the pleasure
of politely informing a gentleman from San
Francisco last month that Stanford could not
permit the Farm's rooters' stunts to be com
mercialized to the extent of advertising the
NBA in the above manner.
The gentleman from San Francisco, repre
senting a regional code authority, decided that
the NBA would benefit materially from such
a "voluntary" public show of approval by
students before the 70,000 spectators. He
staled that it would be a nice gesture for
Stanford to be the school to do it. Stanford's
Bally Committee replied that it is not an
agency for propaganda, and thai if anyone
would be the goat for the job, California would
have to do it.
II is pitiful when government good will
agents have to stoop as low as that to ad
vertise and popularize their movements.
