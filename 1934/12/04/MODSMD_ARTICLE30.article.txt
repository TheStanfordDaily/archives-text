# Bullets in Russia
## 
### 
All is not quiet along the Don, the Volga
el alia, according to reports emanating from
Russia. Assassination of a high government
ollicial is closely followed by news of the
execution of ten Soviet army oflicers. The
latter are said to have plotted the simultane
ous assassination of all the country's leaders.
None of this has much to do with the ques
tion of whether Communism is a success or
not. It merely goes to show that European
politics, including that of Russia,, is not the
peaceful, word-slinging pastime that it is in
America. There bullets, not blarney, are the
favored missiles.
Soviet Russia was conceived in blood and
violence and though the Russian march to
ward the millennium began 17 years ago it
will be a long, long time before complete
unanimity and agreement have been reached,
in Russia or anywhere else.
And since assassinations seem to be pretty
much in the European tradition, there is
nothing surprising about the latest one. It
may or may not be significant. What goes on
in Russia is still more or less a mystery to
the outside world.
