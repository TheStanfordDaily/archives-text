Southern California has been bit by a lean
year in loolball; its team has lost the ability
to win, but none of the Trojans has lost his
ability to grin and bear it and hand the other
man a cheer where a cheer is due.
When Washington's Huskies were batter
ing Ihe slightly weathered Trojan horse hist
Saturday in Los Angeles Coliseum the
Southern rooting section extended Stanford a
friendly gesture. A card stunt pictured a
green tree on a red background, and ;i cheer
for "Stanford, Conference Champs" was
sounded, while the 'Trojan hand played "Come
Join the Rand."
Thanks, El 'Trojan; Stanford appreciates
your courtesy, your fair play and your sports
manship. And Stanford knows that Howard
Jones and the Thundering Herd will be
bouncing right back to the top next year,
