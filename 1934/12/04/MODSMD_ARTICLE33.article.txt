# In Which We Sniffle
## 
### 
To a freshman, membership in an "honor
society" would seem to be the crowning
achievement of one's collegiate career. But
to many a senior, membership in any of
several "honor societies" would seem to indi
cate just how many "suckers" there are on
the campus.
Most "honor societies" exact high member
ship fees from the initiates. Fees of -Y~O
and *lf> are the rule, rather than the ex
ception. Most of this money, it goes without
saying, is pure waste —unless one is willing
to charge it up to his own personal budget as
an "advertising appropriation." (It always
sounds impressive to say: "'Flying Coal-
Scuttle'? Oh, yes, I joined that last year"—or
—"I am proud to consider myself a loyal
member of 'Aqua-Velva Society'.")
In explaining membership fees, a president
of one group said: "We charge $1.1 for mem
bership, because we have to send most of
that amount back to our national headquar
ters." Phooey! In many of the campus soci
eties, the local chapters have been declared
inactive by the national headquarters. In
others, the advantages of national organiza
tion are negligible.
Several societies are willing to aver that the
initiation fee is a huge farce, and of no actual
importance to the society's work. In one of
the outstanding of all campus service organi
zations, one member threw the meeting into
a mild sort of uproar when he asked: "What
happens to the money we pay in as initiation
fees?" Needless to say, there was no accurate
answer.
Surely, some societies perform valuable
services. Others have abolished initiation fees.
But their efforts are curbed by the detrimental
activities of the others. It would be well for
the University to examine the records of ALL
service and activity "honor" societies, and to
reaffirm only those which actually perform
some useful function.
