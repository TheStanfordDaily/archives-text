### CEDRIC LARSON 
From Fred E. Stewart of Sacramento, president of
the National Association of State Tax Administrators,
which organization is now having a meeting in Indiana,
comes the warning that states must unite in solving
their fax problems or see the national administration
take charge of the situation.
"The relationship between the states and the
federal government with respect to such matters
as banks and interstate commerce discloses it is
essential for the states to work in close co-opera
tion if there is to be any satisfactory development
of their taxing powers as affected by these subjects,"
declared Stewart.
He went on to say: "Allocation problems encoun
tered in the administration of taxes or incomes, either
gross or net, and other types of business exercises
demand more than casual contact between state rev
enue officials. Because these problems transcend state
lines it must be clear t,o those who have been studying
them that unless solutions result, the inevitable tend
ency will be to transfer the functions to the federal
government."
Representatives of 20 states listened to the Cali
fornia president as he pointed out that, "due to un
warranted restrictions now contained in the federal
statutes relating to the states' taxation of national
banks practically every state in the union is experi
encing embarrassment in its efforts to tax banks ade
quately." He plead for an adequate bank tax program
by the states, and an equitable state liquor tax.
Stewart is a member of the California Equalization
Board, and Dixwell L. Pierce, secretary, and M. A.
Keesling, assistant secretary of the California State
Equalization Board, were also present.
Earl Charles Thomas, mayor of Palo Alto, Stanford
professor of civil engineering, and an authority on
state taxation problems, feels that although some re
vision of state taxation principles is necessary, that
there is danger in local units surrendering to the.state
too great a share of their taxation prerogatives.
In transferring to the state local taxing privi
leges the communities lose a fundamental measure
of their independence. Proposals are being made
in this state and elsewhere to give a central state
board the power to levy taxes on all classifications
of property, irrespective of the desires of the
local community. Thus the state board of equaliza
tion might tell the town of Menlo Park whether »ir
not it might purchase a fire engine.
"It is perfectly apparent," states Professor Thomas,
"that the attempt is to make available for state use
certain sources of income which have been hitherto
utilized by local units of government. The local unit
of government is, in my opinion, the most efficient unit
so far as the providing of direct service to the people
is concerned —I am speaking of the municipality. The
legislative bodies of the municipalities are directly
and immediately susceptible to the influence of their
constituents.
"The state board of equalization can know
little or nothing of local problems. They are re
motely situated as far as the people directly af
fected are concerned."
Professor Thomas feels that in re-allocating the
tax burden a large measure should be left V/ith the
local unit rather than transferred to the state. He
points out that the League of California Municipalities,
of which he is lust year's president, takes this stand also.

leges the communities lose a fundamental measure
of their independence. Proposals are being made
in this state and elsewhere to give a central state
board the power to levy taxes on all classifications
of property, irrespective of the desires of the
local community. Thus the state board of equaliza
tion might tell the town of Menlo Park whether »ir
not it might purchase a fire engine.
"It is perfectly apparent," states Professor Thomas,
"that the attempt is to make available for state use
certain sources of income which have been hitherto
utilized by local units of government. The local unit
of government is, in my opinion, the most efficient unit
so far as the providing of direct service to the people
is concerned —I am speaking of the municipality. The
legislative bodies of the municipalities are directly
and immediately susceptible to the influence of their
constituents.
"The state board of equalization can know
little or nothing of local problems. They are re
motely situated as far as the people directly af
fected are concerned."
Professor Thomas feels that in re-allocating the
tax burden a large measure should be left V/ith the
local unit rather than transferred to the state. He
points out that the League of California Municipalities,
of which he is lust year's president, takes this stand also.
From Fred E. Stewart of Sacramento, president of
the National Association of State Tax Administrators,
which organization is now having a meeting in Indiana,
comes the warning that states must unite in solving
their fax problems or see the national administration
take charge of the situation.
"The relationship between the states and the
federal government with respect to such matters
as banks and interstate commerce discloses it is
essential for the states to work in close co-opera
tion if there is to be any satisfactory development
of their taxing powers as affected by these subjects,"
declared Stewart.
He went on to say: "Allocation problems encoun
tered in the administration of taxes or incomes, either
gross or net, and other types of business exercises
demand more than casual contact between state rev
enue officials. Because these problems transcend state
lines it must be clear t,o those who have been studying
them that unless solutions result, the inevitable tend
ency will be to transfer the functions to the federal
government."
Representatives of 20 states listened to the Cali
fornia president as he pointed out that, "due to un
warranted restrictions now contained in the federal
statutes relating to the states' taxation of national
banks practically every state in the union is experi
encing embarrassment in its efforts to tax banks ade
quately." He plead for an adequate bank tax program
by the states, and an equitable state liquor tax.
Stewart is a member of the California Equalization
Board, and Dixwell L. Pierce, secretary, and M. A.
Keesling, assistant secretary of the California State
Equalization Board, were also present.
Earl Charles Thomas, mayor of Palo Alto, Stanford
professor of civil engineering, and an authority on
state taxation problems, feels that although some re
vision of state taxation principles is necessary, that
there is danger in local units surrendering to the.state
too great a share of their taxation prerogatives.
