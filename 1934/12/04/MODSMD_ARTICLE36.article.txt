## PRAISES U.S.C. STUNTS 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
It seems to me that some more or
less official word of appreciation
.should be expressed by Stanford for
the courtesy and good sportsmanship
shown by the U.S.C. student body
this last week-end. I refer, of course,
to the card stunt —or stunts, as it
had three pails —between the halves
of the Washington - U.S.C. game,
which congratulated our football
team on winning the 1934 Coast
conference title. Such a gesture
seems to be especially significant and
praiseworthy after all the discussion
that the 1934 "Big Game" aroused.
I hope you will be able to make
some reference in your columns to
this friendly action.
Very sincerely yours,
John Merrill
