## "THE WHITE PARADE" 
### 
At the Stanford Theatre

One of the great photoplays of all !
time, "The White Parade" presents j
a sensitive, realistic, and inspiring j
picture of life in a nurses' training |
school. And in it, beautiful Loretta i
Young surprises by her truly re-

markable pe r
for ma nee as
June Arden,
who, seemingly j
marked by des- i
tiny for a nurse's 1
profession, gives j
up her wealthy
fiance (John!

Boles). Jesse Lasky's careful direc- i
tion always emphasizes the unim
portance of the people themselves
in comparison with their noble work, j
Yet he isolates and individualizes all
the characters and secures from the
entire cast even, competent per
formances.
