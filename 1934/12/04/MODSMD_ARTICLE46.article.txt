LETS MEET THE
UOPIIERS NEXT VEAR

It's too bad it couldn't have been
I his year- that Stanford-Minnesota
football game.
But next year, ii' the respective
.schedule makers will consider it fa
vorably, will suffice as second best
thing in matching these two sectional
emperors of the gridiron.
The Daily's editorial yesterday
was tlie first public mention of
the possibility of scheduling the
Big Ten Gophers to meet the Pa
cific Coast Indians in a regular
intersectional combat, but it was
not the first thought of that
Utopian clash.
It would be a natural, and defi- j
nitely would come closer to filling j
the coffer:.; of both universities than j
did the home-and-home ;r range - i
meat between Stanford and North- I
western.
Yes, it appears that for next
year, at least, Stanford and Min
nesota will continue dominant in j
their respective sections, just as
Southern California and Notre
Dame were dominant some three j
years ago. The only difference
now is (hat the Irish and Trojans |
met on the gridiron and settled
(heir little question.
From .straight drawing power, j
minus tradition and sentiment; S.C. i
■mkJ Notre Dame furnished the best
spectacle of any in the country
din ing those plentiful years. Stan- j
ford and Minnesota next year could |
do the same.
Of course, it would help the
gate next fall if Stanford won j
from Alabama in the Rose Bowl j
and did it in such a manner as to j
challenge the Minnesota claim to j
national honors.
Schedule makers, here is one of I
the big chances of a decade.
The only drawback to this pro- !
posed classic is the matter of ar- j
ranging dates. Stanford does not !
like to travel East in Ihe middle of 1
a season, since the Northwestern
game of 1933. That game cost the
Indians two weeks of valuable prac
tice when that practice was most !
essential.
So Cardinal officials would not I
consent to an eastern jaunt unless
i; wi'i'o to bo a post-season trip, j
II would be fine, they say, if Min- i
nesota could come out heie next j
year, but any home-and-home ar
rangement would have to be post
>e; -on. And the Big Ten ruling still
prohibits after-season games; this'
is thj same rule that keeps Min
nesota from playing in th? Rose
Bowl.

Minnesota's a fine idea for next j
year, but the Gophers are out for
thi.- year, and everyone knows it —
has known it for several -weeks.
So there won't be the kicks there 1
v/oro last year at Stanford's choice
of a Rose Bowl opponent.
It's Stanford vs. Alabama, and
in this case there can be no claim
tliut the Cards chose a weak sis
ter. The Crimson Tide's season
record dispells all of that kind of
comment. There are very few
people in these United States who
do not rate Stanford, Minnesota,
and Alabama as the Big Three,
in varying order, and what could
he more fitting than two of these
getting together in the Pasadena
classic?
True, Stanford and Minnesota
would draw even better than the
Indians and Tide will, but Mlnesota
is out. The Big Ten ruling made it
impossible for the game to mate
rialize, and everyone knows that's
the reason, so there definitely can
be no complaints that Stanford
showed partiality.

Minnesota's a fine idea for next j
year, but the Gophers are out for
thi.- year, and everyone knows it —
has known it for several -weeks.
So there won't be the kicks there 1
v/oro last year at Stanford's choice
of a Rose Bowl opponent.
It's Stanford vs. Alabama, and
in this case there can be no claim
tliut the Cards chose a weak sis
ter. The Crimson Tide's season
record dispells all of that kind of
comment. There are very few
people in these United States who
do not rate Stanford, Minnesota,
and Alabama as the Big Three,
in varying order, and what could
he more fitting than two of these
getting together in the Pasadena
classic?
True, Stanford and Minnesota
would draw even better than the
Indians and Tide will, but Mlnesota
is out. The Big Ten ruling made it
impossible for the game to mate
rialize, and everyone knows that's
the reason, so there definitely can
be no complaints that Stanford
showed partiality.
LETS MEET THE

It's too bad it couldn't have been
I his year- that Stanford-Minnesota
football game.
But next year, ii' the respective
.schedule makers will consider it fa
vorably, will suffice as second best
thing in matching these two sectional
emperors of the gridiron.
The Daily's editorial yesterday
was tlie first public mention of
the possibility of scheduling the
Big Ten Gophers to meet the Pa
cific Coast Indians in a regular
intersectional combat, but it was
not the first thought of that
Utopian clash.
It would be a natural, and defi- j
nitely would come closer to filling j
the coffer:.; of both universities than j
did the home-and-home ;r range - i
meat between Stanford and North- I
western.
Yes, it appears that for next
year, at least, Stanford and Min
nesota will continue dominant in j
their respective sections, just as
Southern California and Notre
Dame were dominant some three j
years ago. The only difference
now is (hat the Irish and Trojans |
met on the gridiron and settled
(heir little question.
From .straight drawing power, j
minus tradition and sentiment; S.C. i
■mkJ Notre Dame furnished the best
spectacle of any in the country
din ing those plentiful years. Stan- j
ford and Minnesota next year could |
do the same.
Of course, it would help the
gate next fall if Stanford won j
from Alabama in the Rose Bowl j
and did it in such a manner as to j
challenge the Minnesota claim to j
national honors.
Schedule makers, here is one of I
the big chances of a decade.
The only drawback to this pro- !
posed classic is the matter of ar- j
ranging dates. Stanford does not !
like to travel East in Ihe middle of 1
a season, since the Northwestern
game of 1933. That game cost the
Indians two weeks of valuable prac
tice when that practice was most !
essential.
So Cardinal officials would not I
consent to an eastern jaunt unless
i; wi'i'o to bo a post-season trip, j
II would be fine, they say, if Min- i
nesota could come out heie next j
year, but any home-and-home ar
rangement would have to be post
>e; -on. And the Big Ten ruling still
prohibits after-season games; this'
is thj same rule that keeps Min
nesota from playing in th? Rose
Bowl.
