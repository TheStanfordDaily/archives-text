WASHINGTON. Dec. 3 (JP).—Up- ,
holding the right of the University 1
of California and other land grant j
colleges to compel students to take (
military training, the Supreme Court j
asserted unanimously today every •
citizen has the duty of defending the
government.
The court affirmed the action of;
the university in suspending two!
students who declined to take the j
training because of conscientious I
objections.
"Government, federal and state, '
each in its own sphere, owes a duty j
to the people within its jurisdiction j
to preserve itself in adequate j
strength to maintain peace and or- :
der and to assure the just enforce- !
ment of law," the decision said.
