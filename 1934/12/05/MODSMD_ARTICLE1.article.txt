# Stanford Triumphs Over Menlo Park In Liquor Dispute
## Merchants Outline Move Of Stores to Border Of Redwood City QUIT FIGHT FOR REPEAL University Limits Measured From Edge of Campus 
### Dick Hodgson 
Stanford University wins its case ;
for elimination of the liquor business j
in Mcnlo Park, with the announce- J
ment that the Menlo Park Mer-.
chants Association has abandoned!
plans to fight for repeal of the state j
law forbidding sale of liquor within ;
a mile and a half of the Stanford i
campus.
Today's announcement by Jean j
I loss, president of the association, 1
was followed by the statement i
from Menlo Park business men i
that the 110-odd beer and hard j
liquor sellers in the community ;
will either move to the outskirts j
of Redwood City, or give up busi- j
ness entirely.
While Menlo Park merchants hac 1 j
definitely abandoned their former j
plans to seek legislative action re- i
pealing the mile and one-half law, i
the possibility was seen ihat one j
chain liquor concern which main- j
tains a branch in the city might make j
a fight.
The State Supreme Court recently .
ruled against the State Board of |
Equalization, which granted liquor
licenses to the dealers in Menlo Park
a year ago on the ground that the
mile and one-half limit shall be j
measured by road from the Admin- |
istration Building.
The court agreed with Stanford 1
attorneys, who claimed that the i
state law dearly orders the meas- |
uremcnt to start from the Quarry
road behind the Palo Alto Ilospi- ,
tal and to proceed from that point i
by air line.
This action will mean a loss of;
approximately $1,000 in annual reve- ;
nue to Menlo Park as virtually one- j
fourth of the merchants are now \
selling beer or hard liquors.
The action also closes tho long>
history of liquor selling in Menlo j
Park, which was interrupted during j
the period of prohibition only to con- j
tinue again during the past yeer.
Neither Almon E. Roth, comp- !
troller, nor President Ray Lyman i
Wilbur could be reached last night j
for a statement on the new action.
