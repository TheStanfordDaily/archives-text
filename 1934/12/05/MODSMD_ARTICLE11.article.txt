1 )i:ak Jam; :
Your letter addressed to the ('ajnpiis Opinion column
today opens a question which has long been a bother to the
| Stanford campus. You, a member of our community for
the past nine weeks, undoubtedly realize by now that Stan
ford means a good deal more to you and to me than just
a place to eat, sleep, study, and have a good time.
For years, people have been talking about that very
elusive thing called "democracy," and when Senator Stan
ford tii'st conceived the idea of a great University in the
West on the site of the then flourishing Palo Alto Dairy
1 Farm, his first thought was that Stanford students were to
be equal, would live in a community apart from metro
politan life, and should be on their own as far as personal
habits and conduct is concerned. The Senator thought of
his University as the place where one might experiment in
the ways of living, learning in a laboratory, perhaps, how
to care for one's self.
Friday, as your communication indicates, opens the
1!).'{.") rushing parties during which nine sororities will take
the part of gracious hostesses to freshman women. You
say that so much is present to confuse one that you do not
know just what to do. You indicate that the "insincerity"
of the whole idea of rushing is antagonistic to your ideals.
! You add that the pressure brought from the folks back
i home, from the boy friend who lias feminine acquaintances
in a certain house, only serve to further the confusion which
surrounds the making of an important decision that will
affect your future life here with the rest of us.
You are vaguely groping for something upon which to
lean, something firm and dependable, something that will
not serve only to bewilder. You s;iy that it people would
let vou alone, the choice eventually would be much easier.

Xaturally, you arc u bit confused with all this rubbish
and talk about where you are going lo live next year. Hut
you lose sight of the fact that inhere you live makes very
little difference. It isn't the name of the organization that
counts, nor a question of Hall vs. How, but a matter of the
friends you will make for yourself and the surroundings
that you will choose for the purpose of being happy and
at ease during the next three years.
. . Â» . *
You mention the "insincerity" of rushing. Naturally, its
is difficult for any group of women to become intimately j
acquainted with 2.~>() new friends in an afternoon's conversa- 1
tion. Remember that, if any organization desires to become |
better acquainted with you, it is because you have iin- j
pressed the members with your personality and appear-{
ance. Should you become affiliated with that group, they
will desire to become your sincere friends and counselors.
Should you choose otherwise you will never miss some
thing you did not seek.
The point to remember at this time rs that, when choos-j
ing; make your selection of the friends with whom you
will live, Hall or Row, without regard to name or reputation,
most mythical and unreal attributes.
Forget about relatives, friends, relations, your parents
who might have heard about a certain house at Vassar
and who do not have the slightest knowledge of Stanford;
forget them all. Disregard what your male companions i
might have lo say. l*hey aren't going to have to live there
next year, it is your problem, and yours alone lo solve.
Refreshing sleep between now and Friday, and no j
worries concerning the future is the best prescription any
doctor could order. Stanford has nine good, clean, friendly
sororities, and the most modern women's dormitories in
the t'nited Slates. You, .lane, will be happiest wherever
your deliberate, unemotional judgment lells you to go.
(iood luck.
, Sincerely,
S i an 1 i K i . lulitor
