## 
### 
HONOLULU, Dec. 4 (/P). — The
monoplane "Star of Australia," fly
ing from Okland to Honolulu,
dropped to the sea today when its
motors stopped for lack of fuel, and
a widespread search was started at
once for Flight Lieutenant Charles
T. P. Ulm and his two companions.
Six hours after Lieutenant Ulm's
frantic message, "Will land ir the
sea," the fliers had not been found
despite the fact many planes and
•-hips were participating in the hunt
over the ocean.
The searchers did not know where
the aviators had been forced down,
but Ihcy believed Ulm and his com
panions, Co-Pilot George LHilejohn
and Navigator-Radio Operator J. L.
Skilling, might be adrift somewhere
within 200 miles of Oahu.
