# Winters Hits At Lamson's Prosecution
## Corruption Charged By English Instructor 
### John McClelland 
Condemning the Santa Clara
County officials prosecuting the Lam
son case as a "corrupt group," Yvor
Winters, English instructor and ar
dent champion of the Lamson de
fense, yesterday expressed belief
that the road to freedom at last is
rapidly opening up for the long
imprisoned former Stanford press
executive.
Co-author with Frances T. Rus
sell of the booklet published last
summer, "The Case of David Lam
son," Winters has been actively in
terested in the cause of Lamson for
a number of months. He has watched
with keen intei-est every move in
the hearings at San Jose this week.
''The case seems to me to be cut
and dried in favor of Lamson,"
Winters stated. "In the recent
hearings the prosecution has done
nothing more than hint they have
new evidence, attack the Su
preme Court's reversal decision,
and demand a new trial, basing
their request on flimsy grounds.
"The prosecution in this case is
a very corrupt group. They are
typical representatives of Santa
Clara County government which
is thoroughly corrupt. This was
evidenced at the original trial of
Lamson where there was enough
perjury to send a good many im
portant officials to San Quentin."
Mr. Winters can see no reason
why the district attorney should hold
back the "new evidence" which he
claims is in his possession. He be
lieves the claim of the prosecution is
false and that they are probably
trying to save their faces by putting
up a good fight.
Speaking of Stanford's part in the
now nearly finished case, Winters
said:
"The attitude of the Stanford
population has been surprising to
me all along. The people of this
community have seemed unwilling
to look into the trial and have been
indifferent to the obvious fraudu
lent character of the original trial.
Stanford simply surrendered at
the very beginning."
Winters bases his firm belief in
Lamson's innocence on the obvious
evidence connected with Mrs. Lam
son's death. He has carefully studied
the narrow bathroom where she met
her death and concluded that a fall
while standing in the bathtub, strik
ing her head against the wash stand,
was the only way her injuries could
have been sustained.

evidenced at the original trial of
Lamson where there was enough
perjury to send a good many im
portant officials to San Quentin."
Mr. Winters can see no reason
why the district attorney should hold
back the "new evidence" which he
claims is in his possession. He be
lieves the claim of the prosecution is
false and that they are probably
trying to save their faces by putting
up a good fight.
Speaking of Stanford's part in the
now nearly finished case, Winters
said:
"The attitude of the Stanford
population has been surprising to
me all along. The people of this
community have seemed unwilling
to look into the trial and have been
indifferent to the obvious fraudu
lent character of the original trial.
Stanford simply surrendered at
the very beginning."
Winters bases his firm belief in
Lamson's innocence on the obvious
evidence connected with Mrs. Lam
son's death. He has carefully studied
the narrow bathroom where she met
her death and concluded that a fall
while standing in the bathtub, strik
ing her head against the wash stand,
was the only way her injuries could
have been sustained.
