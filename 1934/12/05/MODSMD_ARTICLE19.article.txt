# Ex Committee Votes Down Investigation Of Honor Societies
## A.S.S.U. Board Gives Money To Rallymen, Awards Soccer Letters; Cave Presents No 'Secret Plan' on New Theatre 
### IRVIN JORGENSEN 
Declining to involve themselves in the honor societies muddle, Ex
Committee hy a vote of -1 to last night refused to appoint a committee
to investigate the groups.
The honor societies problem, which has been smoldering in political
circles for the past few weeks, was fanned into a flame last night when
the abolition of Scalpers, sophomore men's honor society, was proposed.

♦ With opinion of the group appar
ently against this proposal, Bill Rog
ers, senior member, suggested that a
committee be appointed to investi
gate the possible reorganization of
honor societies and report back to
Ex Committee. The merit of this
plan, Rogers intimated, was that Ex
Committee would not be held re
sponsible for the activities of the
investigating committee and that
the probe would serve to stimulate
the groups. Helen Ray, vice-presi
dent of the A.S.S.U., seconded him
in this proposal.
Opposition from other members of
1 the committee developed. Their
, [ contention was that Ex Committee
j was busy with New Theatre prob-
J lems, did not have the time to con
• cern itself with such a charge, and
[ I probably would accomplish little
' anyway.
One hundred dollars was granted
| by Ex Committee to the Rally
Committee on the petition of
Chairman Julius Jacobs in order
to defray $10 of the expenses of
18 Rally Committee members liv
ing away from Los Angeles.
I ! Ex Committee members can study
i for finals next Tuesday night, unless
.' important business necessitates a
meeting. The group empowered
Kahn and Student Manager Cave to
I "transact A.S.S.U. business for the
! rest of the quarter, except in the
I case of a protest, when a meeting
shall be called."
In his report on the New Theatre
Committee, Kahn urged Ex Com
mittee members to help him "on the
big thing of the year."
Cave's threatened "secret plan"
did not materialize. Cave main
tained a stoical calm throughout the
; meeting. He claimed that his state
j ments to a Daily reporter Monday
| in regard to a proposal for tonight's
| meeting were "strictly informal."
I Circle "S" awards were granted
i | to the varsity soccer men.

I ! Ex Committee members can study
i for finals next Tuesday night, unless
.' important business necessitates a
meeting. The group empowered
Kahn and Student Manager Cave to

! rest of the quarter, except in the
I case of a protest, when a meeting
shall be called."
In his report on the New Theatre
Committee, Kahn urged Ex Com
mittee members to help him "on the
big thing of the year."
Cave's threatened "secret plan"
did not materialize. Cave main
tained a stoical calm throughout the

j ments to a Daily reporter Monday
| in regard to a proposal for tonight's
| meeting were "strictly informal."
