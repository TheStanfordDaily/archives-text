# Ex Committee Isn't Bothered With Mere Investigations
## 
### 
Stanford's student ISxeculive Committee in
dicaled by vote last night, four to three, that
it is too bothersome and risky to invade the
field of honor societies with even so much as
a friendly investigation that might possibly
lead to improvement.
The suggestion by some thai so-called
"honor" groups might really be made to mean
something if one or two of the unnecessary
organizations were eliminated was turned
aside with the hint that the student leaders
should not invite trouble by such a survey
which would probably lead to the abolition of
or or more useless groups. Opinion, irf effect,
is to let them die a "natural" death, leaving
the carcass around until it is able to stand up
and carry itself away.
Somehow, it just doesn't seem right that
any student executives should be unwilling to
look into a situation, good or bad, and settle
a question that undoubtedly is controversial
in nature.
