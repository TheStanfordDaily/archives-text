The house of Lloyd's in London is one of
I lie world's prolific news sources: there is
always something going on there that is odd
and interesting, or vital and informative. The
public likes to think of Lloyd's as a jolly well
sporting hunch of fellows; hut on the contrary
thev are cold and calculating business men,
never likely to act without impartial survey
of the facts.
Thus when Lloyd's announces that it has
wagered a solid $200,000,000 at the extrava
gant odds of 200 to I that there will be no
war in Kurope for the next twelvemonth, it
is reassuring to the rest of the world.
It is doubly heartening to the United States,
inasmuch as of the $1,000,000 premiums that
were paid to Lloyd's for insurance, or the
short end of the "bet," none was backing
possibility of a war between the United States
and any other country.
Concurrently, it was announced thai France
and Germany had reached an agrecmenHn the
dreaded Saar region squabble. The Nazi state
will reimburse France for the coal and iron
rights of the area, that is, in the event that
the coining plebiscite is favorable to Germany.
In the ebb and Mow of war scares, the threat
apparently is subsiding at present; one won
ders what odds Lloyd's will be offering one
year, live vears, ten vears from lodav.
