Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur's action which post
pones winter quarter registration one day in
order that Stanford Hose Bowl Inns will have
lime to return to the campus in an orderly
fashion without undue haste is ;i boon for
which over .'i,(Â»()() of us are duly grateful.
II is pleasant to know thai we are ;i part of
a University in which one fellow likes to help
the oilier man along without being asked to
do so. Faculty and students alike will enjoy
the leisure afforded.
