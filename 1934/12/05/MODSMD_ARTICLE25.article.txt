# Stanford's Lieutenants are Happy

### 
In ruling on the Hamilton-Reynolds ease, ,
which, incidentally, h;is nothing to do with !
Stanford's football players, the tinted States
Supreme Court has decided that the t'niver
sily of California and all other Federal land 1
granl universities have the right to enforce 1
compulsory military training upon their stu
dents.
I naniinoiislv, the Supreme Court upheld
Ihe seldoni-ehallenged principle that il is the
duly ol every citizen to defend his government '
against nil enemies. Though \\;ir is deplored j
by almost everyone, only :i small minority
challenge Ihe justification for ;i defensive war.
The problem, ;is world treaty makers have
found, is lo decide when :i war is defensive |
and when offensive. I

I Aside from that question, however, is the
i fact that the moral status of compulsory mili
tary training is still a matter of doubt, even
though the legality has been established. A
stale university can require military training
but should it?
II a university can compel such training,
it ;ilso has the right to dispense with it. The
duty of :i citizen to defend his country in time
of war is a long way Irom the duty of a citi
-1 zeii to prepare for war in time of peace. While
the former would be taken on if necessary,
i the latter is usually a distasteful burden that
few care to assume.
It would seem that the defenses of the
1 country could he safeguarded without re
quiring military training of anyone. Optional
military training works ell'ectivelv at Stanford
and at manv other universities.
