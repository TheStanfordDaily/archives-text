The Daily, co-ope rat inn with the Men's and
Women's Councils, offers the following bit of
information regarding the operation of the
Honor Code at Stanford I'niversity. It is a
'â–  direct, straight forward talk to each of us bg
those who are charged with the responsibility
of student control on this campus.

The preservation of freedom in the class
room is a vital factor in the success of the
Honor Code, and far more, a vital factor in the
success of student self-government. Any limi
tation of the liberties now enjoyed by students
during examinations would be a denial that
the student body is capable of intelligent and
honorable conduct.
Freedom in the class room cannot tolerate
carelessness because it leads to suspicion,
which is the very thing that breaks down
confidence in the Honor Code. To avoid care
lessness and suspicion during examinations
we recommend that you: (1) sit in alternate
seats, (2) place books and notes away from
your chair, (3) obtain permission from the
instructor if you desire to write the examina
tion outside the class room, (4) leave blue
books in the room if you go outside the room
temporarily.
The improvement of honorable conduct in
the class room, by shifting the responsibility
from the instructor to the students them
selves, depends entirely on the extent of stu
dent support of the Honor Code. Cheating
can be minimized or done away with if stu
dents are willing to do something about every
violation that they observe.
II you observe a violation of the Code, we
recommend the following procedure:
(1) If you think you are capable of it,
handle the case votirself. Talk to the violator,
or write him a note. Above all, demand that
he accept a zero in the examination.
(2) II you have tried the above procedure
and it has not proved effective, or if you are
convinced the violator will not accept your
advice, notify your instructor, or notify a
member ol the Men's or Women's Council.
II is an established practice that the in
vestigations administered by the Men's and
Women's Councils are not made public.
Names and sources of information are pro
tected throughout all proceedings connected
with violations of the Honor Code.
