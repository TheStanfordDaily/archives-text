Newspaper headlines about "Japan's threatened ex
pansion into Italy's African territory" sound like the
trumpet call for a first class pow-wow, but in reality
nothing more has happened than the voicing of anxiety
by Italy due to Japan's commercial penetration of
the dark continent.
King Victor Emmanuel after returning from the
African colonies said: "Japan offers the example of a
people . . . extraordinarily developed economically,
industrially, and in a military way. The birth rate,
energy, and spirit of sacrifice of the Japanese, the
imperious necessity for always seeking new markets,
all combine to make Japan a very great danger for
Europe."
According to Professor Yamato Ichihashi, a recog
nized authority on Japanese activities, tfce entire .situa
tion can be summarized as Italy's irritation from the
success of Japan as a competitor. The Japanese have
secured fertile land in Abyssinia and are raising cotton
to good advantage. Italy dislikes this as it endangers
one of her important trade relationships.
"To characterize that as invasion is not clear."
said Ichihashi. "Any market is open to all coun
tries. The trade expansion of Japan is an important
development and will continue to he. It is a per
fectly legitimate thing for any country to do."
The Far East is Japan's best market. From there
she has used possessions of Western countries as step
ping stones to India and the West. She has business
connections with Europe and is also expanding trade
to Canada, the United States, and South America. It is
easy for her to get into the Mediterranean and African
trade.
"There is no wholesale immigration of Japanese
into Africa. That, is inconceivable," Ichihashi .said. "The
anxiety that Italy entertains probably is not based on
the immigration problem but on trade expansion into
markets heretofore monopolized by the Italian govern
ment and people. In other words, they are worried
about a trade war, not a political war."
If Japan were a European country the objection
to her development as a power would not be so
resented, the professor believes. It is the rising to
a place of power of an Asiatic "heathen" nation
that hurts Italy so deeply, he explained. In Europe
just as in the United States the caricature of
Japan as a nation of backward "fish and rice
eaters" still prevails among the average masses.
Most people do not realize that Japan has a cultural
history that ought to put it among the great powers.
"Japan has developed, in the judgment of other
nations, rather too suddenly. In reality she has been
growing right along as a great powerâ€”unnoticed.
More particularly she is becoming a commercial power,'
Ichihashi said.
"Japan Is the only country, non-white in popu
lation, which lias attained the position of .i great
power. Til at is at the bottom of (he present
trouble."
