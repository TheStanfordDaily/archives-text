The Editor, Sir:
I'm a freshman, and I come to
you lor a little advice because there
is so much confusion among the
girls of my class'on the question of
sororities. None of us exactly knows
just what rushing is all about, and
we're already so bewildered by ad
vice that I, for one, would like to
know just what we are to cxpect
from a sorority, and what they will
expect of us as rushees.
Before I came to Stanford and ever
since, I have been besieged by let- j
ters from friends and relatives and '
advice from fellows on the campus.
Some of them tell me to join u j
sorority; others say "stay in a hall; i
it's more democratic." I realize my
decision on this matter will affect a
large part of my future college life,
and I want to be careful in con
sidering it.
The insincerity of rushing, as I j
have heard about it from others: 1
seems to be appalling; all the arti
ficiality confuses me and makes me J
wonder if it is really worth all the
grief it seems to bring to some who
in past yeais haven't pledged.
It is really important to belong to !
a sorority; does it matter after all !
what house I pledge; and why, oh ,
why, is there so much fuss about it? |
Confusedly,
Jane
