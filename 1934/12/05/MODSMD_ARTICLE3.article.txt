# League Head Lectures on World Setup
## Eichelberger Prophesies American Entrance 
### 
Pleading for America's immediate
entrance into the "community of na
tions," Clark M. Eichelberger, na
tional director of the League of
Nations Association, spoke last night
in the Assembly Hall on "American
Responsibility and Self-interest in
World Affairs."
"Let us consolidate the gains al
ready made," urged Eichelberger.
"Until the world community is uni
versal, it is impossible to carry out
the great plan."
Alternatives Named
There are two possibilities, Eichel
berger explained. America may agree
to join the League of Nations today,
with the understanding that there be
no obligation either to carry out the
terms o fthe Versailles Treaty, or to
resort to armed force in the mainte
nance of peace. The United States
may also agree to enter the League
on the condition that the Kellogg
Pact be made a part of the Covenant.
Although Eichelberger favors un
conditioned acceptance of the League
terms for entrance, the nations, he
states, are even willing to modify or
re-interpret the Covenant to make
possible America's membership. The
United States, however, must take
the first step in proposing closer co
operation.
Planning Is Needed
Eichelberger predicts the entrance
of America to the League of Nations
within three years. ''Then, : ' he re
minded the audience, "the real work
of the world community will have
just begun." Immediate international
economic planning is necessary if we
intend to avoid disastrous future
wars.
To replace the system of dangerous
alliances, Eichelberger recommends
the formation of non-agression pacts
among neighboring states, all within
the League framework.
