In New York there is published a
Social Register or Blue Book. Mulled
over in the greatest secrecy, and
cloaked in the aura of Continental
"nobleness," the names of the social

elite are yearly in
scribed that the
yokels may gaze
and wonder. Each
year a few names
are added, and a
few names are
dropped. Those
who have most
nearly approximat
ed apathy and idle-

ness are added.
Those who have gone out and done
something are dropped. ' The game
has gone on for years.

At Stanford there is a more or j
less legitimate off-spring of the Social
Register racket. Mulled over in the
greatest secrecy, and cloaked in the ;
aura of collegiate "nobleness," the j
names of several dozen Roblc lambs
are yearly added to the rosters of
Farm Sororitydom. The thing is
ballyhooed: there are tea 3, gossip, 1
and uni-sexual dances. Sister Van
Whoosis (of the San Francisco Van i
Whoosises) is introduced to the
lambkins. Finest plate is spread. ;
Backrooms are dusted off or closed j
up. The family album is dragged j
out to prove anything. The whole '
business is climaxed with "Pledge !
Night," a general orgy of kissing and
embracing—the feminine substitute
for backslapping and handshaking.

Drunk with the speed of the pro
cess, (he lambkins who pledge be
! lieve they have attained Nirvana;
j and those who are left behind believe
j ihey are actually goats. Not until the
i following weeks and quarters are
: the lambkins allowed to look be
neath the velvety cloak to see the
shabby pantaloons that hide there.
Not until the shouting and tumult
have died are they faced with the
hard reality of being penned up for
; good with people who soon grow
boring. Not until later do they dis
cover that the sister who speaks up
is promptly sat down or upon. Not
until the house album is once more
gathering dust, do the "family skele
tons come out for their ghoulish fes
tivities.
Then it is too late. There are few

RUSH! GUSH! SLLSII!

i who have the courage to walk out;
but there are many who would like
to. That is what the lambkins must
think of when they are being told of
the imaginary glories of the Greek ,
alphabet. That is what the goatkins
must think of: and then they will
weep not.
Far happier the little .goatkin,
frisking in freedom, than Stanford's
little lambs following Mary to school.
—Dave Mellinkoff.

In New York there is published a
Social Register or Blue Book. Mulled
over in the greatest secrecy, and
cloaked in the aura of Continental
"nobleness," the names of the social

elite are yearly in
scribed that the
yokels may gaze
and wonder. Each
year a few names
are added, and a
few names are
dropped. Those
who have most
nearly approximat
ed apathy and idle-

ness are added.
Those who have gone out and done
something are dropped. ' The game
has gone on for years.

At Stanford there is a more or j
less legitimate off-spring of the Social
Register racket. Mulled over in the
greatest secrecy, and cloaked in the ;
aura of collegiate "nobleness," the j
names of several dozen Roblc lambs
are yearly added to the rosters of
Farm Sororitydom. The thing is
ballyhooed: there are tea 3, gossip, 1
and uni-sexual dances. Sister Van
