The gripe at all-American selec
tions is raging once more, as it al
ways does at thus time of year.
We would like to add a few moans
(,{ oUr own, and also to defend the
various "pickers'* on certain other
.scores.
All-star teams are unfair, there is
little question about that. No one
that chooses them can hope to see
each team and player that is con
sidered in action.
Furthermore, the few players that
a critic does see, he can witness only
once or twice during the season, and
he may see the questioned individual
in a game when he is playing over
his head, or when he has an off day,
as even the best occasionally do
have.
Tl\en, too, there is entirely too
much attention paid to percentages
by all-star selectors. It is consid
ered a breach of professional ethics
if more than two, or at the most
three, players from any one team,
no matter how good that team is,
are placed on a mythical all-Amer
ican eleven.
An example of this was found in
the recent Associated Press all-
American team. There were two
Stanford, two Minnesota, and two
Alabama men on the first team, |
one of each on the second, and none j
on the third eleven.
Those throe teams were admittedly
the outstanding trio in the country,
but when they are rated that close :
to each other on the basis of in- {
dividual stars, it is too much to be j
entirely chance.
Another complaint is that all- j
Americans are built before the sea- j
son ever starts. Newspapers and j
ethers connected Avith this business j
of making stars pick out some one j
or two stars at the outset of a sched- J
ule and play him lip in headlines no |
mailer what he does all year. The j
unfortunate who is forgotten at this j
time is destined to become just an- I
other member of the starting line-up. I
All-star teams, then, are faulty, j
But they have their good points, too. j
They make no claim at actually get- i
ting the best possible working com- j
hi nation of football players. But they j
do claim to gather together a group j
of names that are, and in most cases,
rightly should be the prominent ones |
in football.
This task the all-American selec- j
tors do succeed in accomplishing, |
and the result of their labors does |
furnish some very interesting read- j
ing—even those who scream loudest I
about the injustice read the selec- !
tion.s diligently.
And all-American teams do give
each section of the country an idea i
of what the rest of the nation thinks
of its particular stars. If, for ex- I
ample, an all-star team chosen in ;
Now York selects Bobby Grayson
and Bob Reynolds to all-American
berths, it is a good sign that the
easterners rate Stanford with the
best in the country.
Why should Monk Moscrip and I
Bones Hamilton, for example, take it
as a personal injury; the New York- |
ers have not seen any of the four j
play, and they are merely being in
fluenced by publicity emitting from 1
the Pacific Coast.
And so it goes—there is no real j
sense to all-American teams, but.
ihey are readable, interesting, and
draw forth comment. And that's
their main objective.
