### 
Baseball prospects for 1935 look
bright, as a recent checkup shows
that 18 men from last year's varsity
squad will be out for the team. !
Fourteen are already out, and four
more will report after the Rose Bowl
game.
These four are Monk Moscrip.
Bobby Grayson, Bones Hamilton, and
Stan Anderson. The others are
Beach, Clark, Forsythe, Fred and
Bill Heringer, McÃŸothy, Maggiora,
Marshall, Morgan, Semmelroth, Tre
maine, Walline, and Woolley.
All Workouts Light
Practice sessions at present are
being held only three days a week,
i.nd are light. Batting and fielding
practice is being held but, because
of early nightfall, practice lasts,
barely an hour. However, in winter
quarter the men will practice five
days a week.
Both the frosh and the varsity are ,
now practicing together, but at the
beginning of winter quarter they
will be split up, probably with Ernie
Nevers coaching the frosh and Harry
Wolter the varsity.

football squad have just reported
