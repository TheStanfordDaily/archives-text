# RUGGERS START PRACTICE WITH TURNOUT OF FORTY
## 
### WARREN BREED 
Some 40 rugby players bt.ve as
sembled this week for the first regu
lar practice sessions of the season,
under the hand of Coach Harry Ma
loney. The turnout is promising in
every respect, with many of last
year's stars returning for another
year.
Although the schedule is not yet
complete, the probability is that no
games will be played before the
British Columbia series during
Christmas vacation. Workouts will
be held at least three days in the
week, and probably every day.
Hager Leads Team
Heading the squad was Captain
Roger Hager, a two-year veteran.
With him in the scrum, or forward
line, arc several other veterans, in
cluding George Wyman, Frank In
gersoll, Jim Mullen, Primo Pinotti,
and Ed Becker. All of these but In
gersoll and Becker made the north
era trip last winter, and have had
one or two years' experience.
Backs who turned out include
Ray Lewis the field-goal kicking
artist, George Fuller, Aylett Cotton,
and Otto Bansbach.

| Still a cause for speculation is the
i appearance of several football squad
i members. As the Rose Bowl squad
j is not yet selected, varsity ruggers
J like Ben Palamountain, Joe Vigna,
j and Lewis are not certain whether
they are going north or south.
Palamountain in the past two
years has been outstanding in the
! scrum, frequently grabbing & loose
| ball and tearing off long, scorching
I runs. Vigna is an elusive back and
' a good field man. The absence of
John Reisner and Jack Walton will
' be keenly felt, these two being cer
tain to accompany the grid squad
south.
Many New Men Out
Besides the returning veterans,
I there is a sizeable crop of new men
I who will also make a bid for a place
j on the 15. Some of the '38 frosh are
, out, but will be ineligible for this
!season.
Coach Moloney has announced
that for the first time regulation
rugby equipment will be issued to
(he varsity. Uniforms will piobably
be ready when the five chosen to go
north on the all-star team after
finals.
