# STANFORD STUDENTS GIVEN PREFERENCE IN JOBS AT GAMES
## Pay Per Hour Now Raised To 1929 Standard 
### 
Fifty-one per cent of the 900 people
: employed by the B.A.C. for duty at
the games are Stanford students.
! The B.A.C. policy has always been
| to give registered students the first
chance at jobs.
In case the positions are not filled
; by the students, therl the alumni and
| ex-students, University employees,
! high school and junior college stu
! dents, and outsiders living in or near
I Palo Alto are given chances in the
j order named.
Want Lucrative Jobs
The students, as a rule, prefer the
; jobs at which they can make the
j most money and see part of the game,
i Full time jobs outside the stadium
are hard to fill with students, and the
| same applies to the jobs of small pay,
I such as ushers.
i The pay for the 1933-34 season
j ranged from 40 cents an hour for
| outside jobs to 60 cents an hour for
: men in charge. This year the pay
I has been restored to the 1929 level
| of 50 to 75 cents an hour.
Average Pay $2.25
The average pay for the first five
| home games has been between $2.25
| and $2.50 per game. Ushers received
i the least, $1.28, while concession
| salesmen received the most, $3.60.
Jobs are held for Stanford students
; to within 10 days of game time. After
! this time the various crews are filled
from Ihe sources indicated. If an
I order is received to reduce crews for
. any reason whatsoever, the non
j students are cut off, but never has a
' Stanford student been cut off after
: he was notified he had a job.
Service Rendered
The reason that others in addition
| to students are given jobs is that
it frequently happens that a man
; goes through Stanford and renders
I valuable service to the board in
I some particular job.
He takes up his residence in the
! vicinity and rather than chance some
: new man falling down on the job,
I through lack of experience, this
■ alumnus or ex-student is used until
| .such time as another man can be
; trained for his job.

Fifty-one per cent of the 900 people
: employed by the B.A.C. for duty at
the games are Stanford students.
! The B.A.C. policy has always been
| to give registered students the first
chance at jobs.
In case the positions are not filled
; by the students, therl the alumni and
| ex-students, University employees,
! high school and junior college stu
! dents, and outsiders living in or near
I Palo Alto are given chances in the
j order named.
Want Lucrative Jobs
The students, as a rule, prefer the
; jobs at which they can make the
j most money and see part of the game,
i Full time jobs outside the stadium
are hard to fill with students, and the
| same applies to the jobs of small pay,
I such as ushers.
i The pay for the 1933-34 season
j ranged from 40 cents an hour for
| outside jobs to 60 cents an hour for
: men in charge. This year the pay
I has been restored to the 1929 level
| of 50 to 75 cents an hour.
Average Pay $2.25
The average pay for the first five
| home games has been between $2.25
| and $2.50 per game. Ushers received
i the least, $1.28, while concession
| salesmen received the most, $3.60.
Jobs are held for Stanford students
; to within 10 days of game time. After
! this time the various crews are filled
from Ihe sources indicated. If an
I order is received to reduce crews for
. any reason whatsoever, the non
j students are cut off, but never has a
' Stanford student been cut off after
: he was notified he had a job.
Service Rendered
The reason that others in addition
| to students are given jobs is that
it frequently happens that a man
; goes through Stanford and renders
I valuable service to the board in
I some particular job.
He takes up his residence in the
! vicinity and rather than chance some
: new man falling down on the job,
I through lack of experience, this
■ alumnus or ex-student is used until
| .such time as another man can be
; trained for his job.
