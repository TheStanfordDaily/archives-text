## 
### 
j Winning handily, 40-14, over a
I strong Y.M.C.A. quintet. Coach John
! Bunn's varsity basketball five
â–  clicked in fine fashion last night in a
practice scrimmage game played in
the Pavilion.
Starting out slowly, the Cardinal
five worked up to a fast game fea
turing good passing and shooting.
For the first time this season,'the
attack functioned well, with Rod
Bost, A1 Page, Wytze Goiter, and
Ken Bell the shining lights. Ken
Nobs turned in a steady game.
Bunn gave two full teams a chance
to see action, sending in a. complete
second string squad for the U.st five
minutes of the game.
