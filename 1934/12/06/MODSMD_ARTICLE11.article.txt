## Professor Appointed in New Government Shake-Up; Returns Next Year 
### 
Dr. Theodore John Kreps, sta
tistics expert of the Stanford Grad
uate School of Business, has just
been called to Washington, DC., by
the federal government as chief of
the Statistics Division of the newly

reorganized Na
tional Recovery
A d m inisiration
und e r Donald
Richberg.
The Stanford
pr of ess or en
trained for the
national capital
i mmedia tely,
leaving ' yester
day afternoon.

He will be absent during the greater
part of 1935. Dr. Kreps will be
placed in charge of approximately
100 government statisticians.
The recent shake-up in the Na
tional Recovery Administration
was the result of Roosevelt's de
termination to place that organiza
tion of a permanent and efficient
basis. Krep'§ key position is part
of the Division of Research and
Planning under Leon Henderson,
which is in turn a part of the NRA
board and the National Emergency
Council.
Dr. Kreps stated he was going in a
purely technical and professional ca
pacity. He is taking with him many
monographs and statistical studies
for reference which have been pre
pared by his Graduate School of
Business students on specialized
topics as the result of intensive re
search.
"The NRA hoard wishes to
build up a statistical division for
permanent use," explained Dr.
Kreps, "the purpose being to work
for closer harmony between gov
ernment and business. The sta
tistics on which the NRA board
has had to rely in the past have
been compiled mainly by manu
facturers' or employers' associa
tions, inventory figures, or census
reports. These have been intended
often primarily for export and
import trade purposes.
"The federal government now pro
poses to assemble purely objective
tables of various sorts upon which
full reliance may be placed. No
doubt a great many statistics which
are gathered by us will never be
made public. Through analyses of
these revised and up-to-date sta
tistics, government experts can
immediately check for guidance and
policy-determination of the course
of any given industry."
Dr. Kreps is widely known as an
author of numerous statistical stud
ies..
