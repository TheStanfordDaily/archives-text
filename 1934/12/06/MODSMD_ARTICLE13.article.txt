# Perplexing Questions Answered As Rushing Season Begins for Women
## 
### BARBARA SWEET 
With the fall rushing teas for freshmen women
commencing tomorrow and the regular winter rush
period not far off. the time has come to answer some
of the many questions that now perplex both Roble
and the campus at large. Of these questions two in
particular are heard frequently: What percentage of
eligible women will be bid by the nine campus sorori
ties next January, and how does the cost of living in
sororities compare with that in dormitories?
Because of housing limitations, the campus sorori
ties will be forced, on the average, to pledge a much
smaller class this year than they did last. It is esti
mated that each house will bid about 11 women, as
compared to last year's 15. No house is planning to
take in more than 14 pledges and several houses will
bid only eight. All together it is probable that a
maximum of 100 women will be pledged by the nine
houses.
As there are 250 freshmen and 12(1 transfers, a total
of .170 women eligible for rushing, and only 100 of
these can be bid, only 10 out ol 37, or 27 per cent of
the new women, will be asked to join sororities.

How does the average cost of living in a sorority
compare with that in a university-run dormitory?
Figures show that the house bill of a sorority woman
usually amounts to around $52 a month, < r $150 a
quarter. Of this money, 15 per cent, or $24, goes toward ,
paying dues, although this item varies. Some houses
have fees as large as $42 a quarter, while the lowest
figure is $9 for the same period. The c-ost o r
board and room is $132 a quarter.
The cost of board and room to the non-sorority
women is the same as that of one who is affiliated.
She pays $132 per quarter on the average to univer
sity for food and shelter. The exceptions to ihis i nK
are the women living in some of the smaller houses of
the Union unit. They pay only $122 a quarter.
The unaffiliated woman saves, however, when it
comes to dues and outside fees. She pays $3 quarterly
dues to her living group, as contrasted to the $24 payed j
by the sorority woman.
The cost of living in a dormitory, therefore, is 14
per cent less than the cost of living in a sorority. The
student who lives in the former saves $21 a quarter :>r '
$G3 a year.

She pays $132 per quarter on the average to univer
sity for food and shelter. The exceptions to ihis i nK
are the women living in some of the smaller houses of
the Union unit. They pay only $122 a quarter.
The unaffiliated woman saves, however, when it
comes to dues and outside fees. She pays $3 quarterly
dues to her living group, as contrasted to the $24 payed j
by the sorority woman.
The cost of living in a dormitory, therefore, is 14
per cent less than the cost of living in a sorority. The
student who lives in the former saves $21 a quarter :>r '
$G3 a year.
With the fall rushing teas for freshmen women
commencing tomorrow and the regular winter rush
period not far off. the time has come to answer some
of the many questions that now perplex both Roble
and the campus at large. Of these questions two in
particular are heard frequently: What percentage of
eligible women will be bid by the nine campus sorori
ties next January, and how does the cost of living in
sororities compare with that in dormitories?
Because of housing limitations, the campus sorori
ties will be forced, on the average, to pledge a much
smaller class this year than they did last. It is esti
mated that each house will bid about 11 women, as
compared to last year's 15. No house is planning to
take in more than 14 pledges and several houses will
bid only eight. All together it is probable that a
maximum of 100 women will be pledged by the nine
houses.
As there are 250 freshmen and 12(1 transfers, a total
of .170 women eligible for rushing, and only 100 of
these can be bid, only 10 out ol 37, or 27 per cent of
the new women, will be asked to join sororities.

How does the average cost of living in a sorority
compare with that in a university-run dormitory?
Figures show that the house bill of a sorority woman
usually amounts to around $52 a month, < r $150 a
quarter. Of this money, 15 per cent, or $24, goes toward ,
paying dues, although this item varies. Some houses
have fees as large as $42 a quarter, while the lowest
figure is $9 for the same period. The c-ost o r
board and room is $132 a quarter.
The cost of board and room to the non-sorority
women is the same as that of one who is affiliated.
