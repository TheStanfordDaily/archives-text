# Axe Back In Cellar Case
## 
### 
Newly engraved—''l9ls4 Stanford J). |
California 7"—the Stanford Axe and j
plaque is back in its Union Cellar |
case for another year.
A.S.S.U. President Marvie Kahn |
took the axe for a ride up to Ber- <
k*. ley on Big Game day. But it was j
an uneventful ride. The Axe was .
never even .so much as taken on the j
(i< Id. After the game Kahn quietly
took the famed symbol of football
supremacy back to the farm and
thence to the engravers to have a
second Stanford victory recorded on
its surface.
The incident was one of distinct j
contra 1 1 to the trip the Axe made
between Cal and the Farm in 1930.
in that year a group of Stanford men 1
literally wrested the Axe from under
the noses of the California men who
guarded il and beat a triumphant
and hurried retreat back across the
bay.
Last year the ancient symbol was
made a trophy. It was polished and
varnished and placed upon a plaque.
For a year it has rested in the U,nion
Cellar, but just as a safeguard
against any ambitious Cal men who
might forget that the Axe is now a |
trophy, the plaque is firmly chained
to its case.
