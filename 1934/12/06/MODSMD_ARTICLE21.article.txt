'"Don't let St. Nicholas Nick you,"
Editor Gordon Steedman, of the
Chaparral, writes in to say. "Save
your 16 pennies for the Chaparral
Christmas Number and the one cent
sales tax."
Breaking the Chaparral Thursday
tradition, the Christmas number will
appear on the Quad Friday of next
week. "Just in time for finals,"
quoth Steedman.
Steedman, with his usual modesty,
admits that this issue is going to be
"good." To the multifarious abilities
of Dink Dawson, who will illustrate
the cover; and Gilman Gist, who will
illustrate practically anything, in
cluding an esoteric story by Jim
Copp; Steedman has added such
outside talent as John Coulthard,
artist from Modesto; Dohrman H.
Smith, San Francisco Examiner ar
tists; and Ned Hilton, an artist who
contributes to New Yorker.
Anne Ritchie breaks into song in
a pretty ditty on Christmas. Other
Chappie stars will display their
Yuletide wares with "Unpublished
Letters of Famous Men," "Shopping
Lists," and other ready -to wares.
