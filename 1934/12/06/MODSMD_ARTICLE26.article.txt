# Rescuers Seek Ulm As Search Draws To Close
## 'Last Chance' Search for Australian Flyers Undertaken 24 Hours after Last SOS Sent from Plane; Hope for Aviators' Safety Fades 
### 
HONOLULU, Deo. .» (/P)—A mammoth "last chance" search by air
and sea for the luckless Australian flyers, Lieutenant Charles T. P. Ulm
and his two companions, was drawing toward a close in a wide area sur
rounding the Hawaiian Islands today.
More than 24 hours had elapsed since the last feeble SOS had been
heard from Ulm's transoceanic plane, presumably then floating on the

► Pacific somewhere off the Island of
Oahu on which Honolulu is situated.
Hope Aroused
Hope of a rescue was aroused by
Lieutenant Paul Foley, one of the
j searching naval aviators, when he
i reported he had "sighted a drifting
object" 300 miles southwest of Hono
lulu and "was going to investigate
I it."
After an hour without further re
port from Foley, naval officials ex-
J pressed the opinion that his discovery
probably was merely driftwood.
Sampans Join Hunt
Not to give up, Hawaiians then
I pinned their faith in the Jrpanese
j fishing sampans, more than a hun-
I dred of which were at sea cruising
from 300 to 500 miles offshore from
all the major islands. Without
j means of communicating with land,
the result if any of the fishermen's
i search could not be learned until
' the sampans had returned to the
I islands. It was hoped that some
i fisherman might have sighted the
; flares of the trio last night, if the
| Australians were alive, afloat, and
| able to signal.
Twenty - seven American army
| and navy planes yrere in the air
today, scouting the Pacific in an
ever widening circle about Oahu.
; Hundreds of surface craft were in
the hunt, including United States
! submarines and destroyers.
Storm Spurs Efforts
Spurring their efforts was an ad-
I verse weather forecast. Rough
j weather was again in the offing and
j was expected to blanket the area
by nightfall.
Despair shaded the great attempt
j to find the lost plane, Star of Austra
-1 lia. How long it could stay afloat
was only a matter of conjecture.
Searchers, too, were totally in the
dark as to its position even when
it last called for help.
Theory Offered Navy
Captain Larry Doetsner, master
of the freighter Kaliko, offered the
! navy a theory which would place the
i plane southwest of Honolulu, when
it crashed into the sea yesterday.
Captain Doetsner's theory is the
flyers mistook his freighter for the
liner President Coolidge early Tues
day when flying to Hawaii. He be
lieves when Ulm radioed the Cool
idge "I am about over you now" he
really was above the MalTko at a
| high altitude.
