# Runyon on Stanford And Vice Versa
## 
### 
Well, lads, the seer of Universal Service
lias investigated the football situation by spe
cial delivery letter and has made his report.
101 Runvon, the celebrated sports critic, has
nonchalantly cast out the vital information
that Alabama will whip Stanford in the Rose
Bowl by any casual, but complete and definite
score.
And for that reason, the athletic manage
ment of the University of Alabama should
bring suit against this man-with-the-schnoz
zle-sluck-out for defaming the ability of ils
football team. IJee.ause when "expert' Kunyon
selects a team to win he automatically close
hauls it with the most notorious handicap in
Ihe sports world. Reason: rarely, if ever, do
Damon lUinyon's choices win.
Sports writers generally are noted for their
colossal elTronlerv; but seldom does even Mr.
Mark Kellcy of Los Angeles or Mr. Pal Fravne
of San Francisco produce a column of bilge
water on the merits of two football teams
located in opposite sections of the country,
without the benefit of observing those teams
in action. That was an indiscretion committed
by El Kunyon.
However, there is some doubt 1 hut an in
tense scrutiny of Alabama and Stanford on
successive Saturdays would have brightened
Runyon's perspicacity. He Haunts such an
unnatural excess of stupidity concerning the
gridiron that his prognostications could hardly
be improved on such brief acquaintance as one
season could fluidei:.
The capacity of an "expert" is one 100 easily
gained in the sports writing racket. For in
stance, one well-known and competent San
Francisco sports writer was sent out to cover
a couple of polo games, for the single reason
that there was nothing else doing and he had
to earn his pay check. "In two weeks," he
told later, "I was considered an authority on
Ihe game. And I don't know yet which end
of the horse I hey hang the tail on."
El Kunyon turns his phrases with such
complacent poise that the intelligent reader
puzzles over them, expectant of irony and
trying to lind il; but the former intended no
irony, lb' is quite satislied to be accounted a
mere "expert."
Kunyon, plainly you are a fake; why don'l
you go out and get a good shell game, and at
least be an honest fake?
