# Tonight in the Pavilion
## 
### 
Tonight simon-pure, untainted, amateur
sport will have ils ;i Ming that is far too
infrequent even in collegiate circles. In the
Stanford haskethall pavilion 23 novice boxers
will square oil' and settle the question of who
are the eight hest, inexperienced University
boxers.
These 23 are not the cream of the collegiate
crop; they are far from being the best athletes
in the country or even at Stanford. Highly
thousand spectators will not kock from miles
away to see them go through their paces at
>' I. H) per throw nor will chattering telegraph
keys send thousands upon thousands of words
on the event to an eager outside world. No
body outside of Stanford knows or cares what
they do tonight.
et there will be and should be a good crowd
there lo back them up. For these 23 athletes
are doing more to maintain the true spirit
of amateur sport than brilliant, highly publi
cized intercollegiate athletes. This is no rc
llcction upon the latter. II is not their fault
that college athletics has been over-commer
cialized. Mill the fact exisls and we may as
well accept the obvious conclusion thai inter
collegiate contests are pseudo-professional in
character, their chief function being to fur
nish a public spectacle.
Therefore, tonight's tournament and similar
contests must be depended upon to carry out
the spirit of amateur sport. Tonight it makes
no dill'erence who wins. The matches are be
ing held for the fun of the thing. Thai's all
and that's enough.
