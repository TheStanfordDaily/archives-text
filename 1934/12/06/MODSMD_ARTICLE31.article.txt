# The
						Theatre Is Coming
## 
### 
Years of organization, planning, and sludy
apparently are about lo hear fruit with the
indication that Stanford's new theatre will
possibly enter construction by the end of the
next six months.
The poor, antiquated, unhappy structure
kindly designated as Ihe Assembly Hall is

f about to >by the boards as the official home
j of Hit' local drama. Xo tears are shed, no
veils of black mark the passing.
A Stanford School of the Theatre, School
of Music, and conjunctive organizations will
do much to l'urther the very noticeable inter
est in campus performances that has grown
steadily with seasons of experience. It will
, liriup; to the Farm those talented artists who
intend to make ;i lite study of the drama and
would desire to do :is much for Stanford
dramatics as they would seek to gain from the
1 doing. Stanford, the I'liiversitv, and the
seeker of beauty would profit.

Question number one at the present writing
centers about the proposed financing of the
project, that involves a building program of
half a million dollars. For the past three
years, the Daily has consistently asked for
immediate action on the proposition, and last
spring Stanford students voted conclusively
to assess themselves one dollar per quarter,
; iii the hope that the University could then raise
sullicient funds to start construction.
During the past two months, student leaders
have discussed a new proposition to divert the
Union dollar to the cause, and add additional
funds from other student organizations. The
! result would mean an approximate two and a
' quarter dollars from each student, making a
total of some twenty-two thousand dollars a
1 year for twenty years or so.
j During the next few weeks, much will be
I done to determine the precise status of pres
! ent plans. Something should be considered
that will lessen the burden on the students
| and yet provide sufficient financial support for
the complete project.
