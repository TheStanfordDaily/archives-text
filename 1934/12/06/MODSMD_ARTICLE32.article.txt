# Music in the Spring
## 
### 
The 1934 Hi(lame (iaieties proved clearly
that campus talent can he used to put on a
clever, entertaining, and thoroughly enjoyable
evening.
There is no reason in the world why the
Dramatic Council should not revive the all
campus idea, and produce a musical revue
during the spring quarter. II would undoubt
edly lill the Assembly Hall, make money lor
the dramatics coffers, and completely satisfy
a campus audience.
Musical and dramatic talent on the Farm
abounds in plenty, as evidenced by the un
usually good music and lyrics which came
out of this year's (laieties. That the students
realize this fact was also proved by a peek
inside the theatre once the performance had
started. All seats were taken, and not even
standing room could be had.
In the eastern colleges, hi-jinks and musical
comedies are the rule, with Vale and Dart
mouth going in for shows, and choruses, where
men perform all the work. With plenty of
women on tlu- Stanford campus, il would be
an easy task to gel excellent casts for such
theatrical productions.
With talent, a recognized need for such a
production, and a student body that would
eagerly await the event, the Daii.v awaits
action on the part of campus dramatists.
