### CROMPTON BANGS, Jr. MR. HOPKINS AND EPIA 
WASHINGTON, D.C., Dec. 3.—A month ago capi
talists were crawling under the bed at the mention of
Sinclair's EPIC. Then came November 8 and the
defeat of Sinclair and all his works. Better than thut,
even President Roosevelt was showing hopeful signs
of staying just to the right of the middle of the road.
But a few days ago many conservatives got a
rude shock. The President's left-hand relief man.
Harry Hopkins, had brought out a plan to End
Poverty in America (EPIA). What was worse it
looked almost exactly like EPIC. It proposed
further expansion of subsistence homesteads;
large scale removal of families from unprofitable
land to U.S.-provided homesites; loans of money
lo buy tools and livestock; more and more factories
for the jobless, and finally, a large-scale. low-cost
housing program in the big cities.
You will remember that Upton Sinclair proposed
to have California take over idle farms and put un
employed to work on them; he also proposed to take
over idle factories to make jobs for the jobless in the
cities. Thus Mr. Hopkins' plan differs from EPIC in
detail but not in principle. This is what worries con
servatives so; having got rid of Mr. Sinclair in Cali
fornia, they find that the United States is going EPIC
one better.
However, there is no reason for conservatives
to worry—at least not yet. All of what Mr. Hopkins
proposes on a grand scale in EPIA has already been
started on a small scale. Subsistence homesteads,
Mrs. Roosevelt's wicker furniture factory and
government housing are all familiar front page
words. So far they have proven fairly successful,
but terribly expensive considering how many job
less they have taken care of.
This is exactly what worries the more farsighted.
They feel it's no use thinking about the socialistic
aspects of the program; what bothers them is the cost.
Even careful statisticians estimate it would fr.ke four
billion a year, and this allows for the abolition of the
FERA and a 75 per cent cut in the PWA. This sum
is half a billion more than we are now spending yearly.
Nobody knows how long we would have to keep
dishing out cash once we got started. But if Congress
has anything to say. it will before a long time. Right
now it would be fairly easy to raise Ihe money: later
it would be very hard to pay it back without much
higher taxes or further dollar devaluation. If pros
perity returns it will help some, but not much.
We might as well gel used to taking care of at
least four million unemployed every year for a
long time. This EPIA is an expensive way; there
are cheaper ways—(he cash dole is one of them,
but socially it is less desirable. And it leaves no
permanent public improvements. So we are ap
parently committed at least in part to Mr. Hopkins'
plan. Now what does its appearance at this time
mean?
It can mean one of three things: (1) That Mr.
Hopkins has been lying low during the campaign; (2)
EPIA is F.R.'s plan for relief in the future; (3) Thut
il is a trial balloon. The last is the more likely.
Mr. Hopkins is n clever man; he may b<> asking for
much more than he hopes to get in order to get much
more than ho would otherwise receive.

permanent public improvements. So we are ap
parently committed at least in part to Mr. Hopkins'
plan. Now what does its appearance at this time
mean?
It can mean one of three things: (1) That Mr.
Hopkins has been lying low during the campaign; (2)
EPIA is F.R.'s plan for relief in the future; (3) Thut
il is a trial balloon. The last is the more likely.
Mr. Hopkins is n clever man; he may b<> asking for
much more than he hopes to get in order to get much
more than ho would otherwise receive.
WASHINGTON, D.C., Dec. 3.—A month ago capi
talists were crawling under the bed at the mention of
Sinclair's EPIC. Then came November 8 and the
defeat of Sinclair and all his works. Better than thut,
even President Roosevelt was showing hopeful signs
of staying just to the right of the middle of the road.
But a few days ago many conservatives got a
rude shock. The President's left-hand relief man.
Harry Hopkins, had brought out a plan to End
Poverty in America (EPIA). What was worse it
looked almost exactly like EPIC. It proposed
further expansion of subsistence homesteads;
large scale removal of families from unprofitable
land to U.S.-provided homesites; loans of money
lo buy tools and livestock; more and more factories
for the jobless, and finally, a large-scale. low-cost
housing program in the big cities.
You will remember that Upton Sinclair proposed
to have California take over idle farms and put un
employed to work on them; he also proposed to take
over idle factories to make jobs for the jobless in the
cities. Thus Mr. Hopkins' plan differs from EPIC in
detail but not in principle. This is what worries con
servatives so; having got rid of Mr. Sinclair in Cali
fornia, they find that the United States is going EPIC
one better.
However, there is no reason for conservatives
to worry—at least not yet. All of what Mr. Hopkins
proposes on a grand scale in EPIA has already been
started on a small scale. Subsistence homesteads,
Mrs. Roosevelt's wicker furniture factory and
government housing are all familiar front page
words. So far they have proven fairly successful,
but terribly expensive considering how many job
less they have taken care of.
This is exactly what worries the more farsighted.
They feel it's no use thinking about the socialistic
aspects of the program; what bothers them is the cost.
Even careful statisticians estimate it would fr.ke four
billion a year, and this allows for the abolition of the
FERA and a 75 per cent cut in the PWA. This sum
is half a billion more than we are now spending yearly.
Nobody knows how long we would have to keep
dishing out cash once we got started. But if Congress
has anything to say. it will before a long time. Right
now it would be fairly easy to raise Ihe money: later
it would be very hard to pay it back without much
higher taxes or further dollar devaluation. If pros
perity returns it will help some, but not much.
We might as well gel used to taking care of at
least four million unemployed every year for a
long time. This EPIA is an expensive way; there
are cheaper ways—(he cash dole is one of them,
but socially it is less desirable. And it leaves no
permanent public improvements. So we are ap
parently committed at least in part to Mr. Hopkins'
plan. Now what does its appearance at this time
