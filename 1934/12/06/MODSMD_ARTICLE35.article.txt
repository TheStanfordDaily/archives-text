JUSTICE: NOT BLIND BUT BATTY
It was not long ago that the press '
carried daily reports of the European
escapades of Samuel Insull, utilities ;
magnate turned fugitive from jus
tice. There were many who hoped

the old boy would
keep off the law's ;
bloodhounds; it was
rather thrilling: the
thought of a grey
haired and dodder
ing man defying the
most powerful na
tion on earth. Nat
urally, there were j
many who were j
anxious to see him

safely in jail. There was some fear |
that left loose he would begin pull
ing utilities over the heads of the
gullible Gi'eeks.

Everyone —or nearly everyone —
was agreed that Insull was guilty,
"guilty as hell." His flight gave
credence to this belief. Trapped,
and brought to trial in the United
States, Insull told his story. He
blubbered about working up from
the bottom, admitted he told in
vestors his stock was worth $10,000,-
000 more than it actually was worth,
attributed the losses of innocent in
vestors to "bad judgment." The jury
figured he was all right after all. and
that anyone can make mistakes: they
acquitted Samuel Insull.

The wonder is not that Insull made
mistakes. No one is infallible; Tom,
Dick, and Harry all commit error—
even as Samuel Insull. Yet there are
some important differences. When
Tom, Dick, and Harry blunder—
Tom, Dick, and Harry are the only
sufferers. If their blunders affect
others—they ordinarily land in the
cooler, even if they are sorry for
what they did. But when Insull
utilities collapsed, beneath the fallen
pillars of his financial temple were
the crushed lives of a trusting pub
lic. They did not think they were
gambling. Insull was safe; but not
for them.

If John on the Street loses a
greenback in a poker game, the
moral half of the community raises
its eyebrows and shudders a right
eous shudder. It screams ihat
gambling should be forbidden, be
cause it is wicked and wasteful. Not
only do they scream, but everywhere
outside of Reno their screams are
heeded; and gambling becomes il
legal.
Apparently, Insull was operating a
giant gambling casino under the very

eyes of the Boards of Morals. For
only in gambling casinos can suck
ers lose to the dealer, and .-till see
the dealer go free. It is a queer
Board of Morals that does not cry
out at the Insull swindle. Unless
public gambling is to be allowed on
the most grandiose scale the world
has ever seen, Insull must not be
allowed to lose other people's
money.
Insull was most certainly sorry.
He was sorry he got caught.
