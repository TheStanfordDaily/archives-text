AN AGED CUSTOM BOBS IT
AGAIN: The -Best' Films
It is the amusement of cri'ics from
time to time to make lists of "the
best" cinemas. Unsatisfactory as any
such list must necessarily be, such
gleanings do have the advantage of;
reminding the skeptical that some
really worthy films do appear from i
time to time.
It is my pleasure below to select
a number of films which seem to me
to be most generally worthy of
recollection. By "generally" I mean
as a unified, whole rather than be
cause of the performance of a single
actor or the merits of the camera
work in an otherwise undistinguished
film.
Such a basis for selection precludes
mention of a good many films excel
lent in one or two respects and defi
cient in others. Such a film, for in
stance, as The Thief of Bagdad is
memorable for the imaginative set
tings of William Cameron Menzies
which, however, only served as a
background for Mr. Fairbanks' ath
letic demonstrations. And while the
performance of Sylvia Sydney in
Madame Butterfly was a splendid
and exceedingly sensitive one, the
vehicle itself was too hackneyed to
permit of its inclusion on a iist which
I is already overlong for journalistic
publication.
Further, the list is not intended to
. be representative of purely tcch
-1 nical matters and so excludes the
melodramatics of The Birth of a
Nation and the tinny sobbings of
The Jazz Singer, despite the intro
i duction of the close-up in one and of
a crudely developed sound track in
j the other.
The basis of this list, then, is sin
cere dramatic value, of consistent
j and thoroughly .sound or brilliant
technics, of sensitive acting and di
recting. With this much introduction,
then, let us proceed to the list itself:
It is with pleasure that I recall:
All Quiet 011 the Western Front for
the scope and remorselessness of its
criticism, which criticism is pictorial
rather than vocal, dramatic rather
than rhetorical; A Bill of Divorce
ment because it is a straightforward
adaptation of u social tragedy given
| splendid attention by a fine cast and
director; Catherine the Great, be
! cause the taste of the production as a
whole and the dignity of Elizabeth
Bergner's performance in particular,
justified and exalted its departure
from fact.
Cavalcade as a spectacle-film with
dignity and sweep, well adapted from
an ingeniously contrived and fre
quently moving play; The Cocoanuts,
because it is a demonstration of mad
comic scramble ranging from sharp
satire to lowest slapstick performed
I by the hysterical Marx Brothers;

1 Tlu* Dreyfus Case as a dramatic
: human document as well as a .sincere
portrait of historical fact; Eskimo,
for its epic quality and its line use
i of the camera in a medium pecu
liarly suited to it.
