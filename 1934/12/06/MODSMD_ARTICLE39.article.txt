"GIRL O' MY DREAMS"
At the Stanford Theatre
Thus is another college picture,
and is no different from the ordinary
run except that there are heroes in
stead of a hero and they are track
rather than football stars.
The scenes,of fraternity and so
rority houses will be amusing to
college students. Mary Carlisle is
the somewhat chubby heroine, and
Arthur Lake, that perennial youth,
is the lad who does the winning pole
vault for dear old Rawley. But Mary
walks off with someone else, if you're
interested.

"LIMEHOUSE BLUES"
Also at the Stanford Theatre
George Raft does a half-caste
Chinese smuggler in London's Lime
house in this morbid picture which
features the ancient struggle be
tween West and East. Jean Parker
as the girl to whom Raft would like
to be more than a friend, but she
will have none of it and falls in
love with Kent Taylor, who owns a
pet store in Picadilly.
Anna May Wong, without whom no
Oriental picture would be complete,
gracefully commits suicide when she
tees that Raft has fallen in love with
Jean, and Raft also dies, leaving
Jean and Kent kissing in a taxi in
the final fadeout. —Harlan.
