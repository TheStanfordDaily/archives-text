# AIRPORT MAY BE MOVED TO FIELD NEAR BAYSHORE
## 
### IRVIN JORGENSON 
In the near future Stanford may no
longer have the airplanes that cut
their capers over the red-tiled roofs.
The airfield commonly dubbed "The
Stanford Airport," operated by the
Associated Air Services on the
northeast corner of the campus, may
be moved away from Stanford down
to a new field on the bay flats.
The construction of this new
field is awaiting final approval by
SERA and the City of Palo Alto,
who will build it together on a
flat 011 the bay side of the Bay
shore Highway.
Though there has never been any
official connection between the fly
ing school and the University, the
fact that the property is leased from
the University, the fact that many
Stanford students have learned to

fly on the field, and that some Stan
ford men have been instructors, has
caused many people to consider that
a relation exists between the two.
Over 40 Stanford students arc
now flying at the Associated Air
Services, according to J. F. Dono
van, manager. Of these, about 15
already have their private pilots'
licenses.
Two students holding private
pilots' licenses are women, Marjorie
Kitselman and Yvonne Beattie. Miss
Kitselman, only aviatrix on the cam
pus until joined by freshman Beattie
this year, was the "Pilot 689710" who
defended airplaning against an edi
torial by Editor Abe Mellinkoff. He
attacked low flying over the campus
as a menace to concentrated study
ing.
