# Educator Devotes Life To Service of Women
## 
### 
Michi Kawai, the most famous
woman educator of Japan, who will
speak here tomorrow night at 7
o'clock in the Women's Clubhouse,
has spent her life in service for the
Japanese women.
She came from a family which
founded and dedicated a . hrine to
the Sun Goddess on the beautiful
Island of Ise. Messengers of the
Emperor consulted on this island,
and all important politics of the
country were made known there. It
was closely connected with the royal
I family's welfare.
Ability Recognized
It was on this island that Michi
Kawai grew up. She went to school
j in Japan, and there met Mr. Inazo
i Nitobe, exchange professor in Amer
j ican universities and at one time
j Japan's representative at Geneva.
He immediately recognized in her
| great ability and leadership, and it
j was through him that Michi Kawai
I obtained a scholarship to Bryn
I Mawr.
While at college Miss Kawai de
i cided to dedicate herself to the
i greater enlightenment for the women
j of Japan. Her first step in this direc
tion was the social service work
which she did for several years after
leaving college.
Traveled Extensively
On her missions she traveled
i through Great Britain, Europe, Si
i beria, Manchuria, the United States,
; and Canada. People of all nations
made her welcome and were inter
i ested in what she had to tell them.
Her education, her extensive trav-
I els, and above all, her fine mind have
| given her a viewpoint which is ultra
! modern. She is trying to bring Japa
nese women to have the same sane
outlook on life which western
i women have.
She has said: "It is essential for
Japanese to learn a western language

in order to take a wider view of the
world. I teach them internationalism
side by side with patriotism." In
stressing internationalism for Japan
Miss Kawai is attempting to bring
new ideals to the people of those
islands, long shut off from the rest
of the modern world.
One of Miss Kawai's greatest works
has been the founding of a school in
Japan where the daughters of so
cially prominent families meet rural
girls on the same social plane, and
for their mutual benefit. This is a
revolutionary move in the training
of girls in Japan, modern as that
country has made itself in the last
few years.
