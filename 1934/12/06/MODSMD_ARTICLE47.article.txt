The Editor, Sir:
Despite my limited personal ac- j
tivity in counter, there are yet many ]
students who persist in the unfair j
and unfortunate delusion that the j
Epistle to Jane, of Wednesday's is- |
sue, with its incomparably irrele
vant biographical material, is deli- 1
cious, though perhaps a too proxi- j
mate travesty on Hearst and High i
School editorial banality, and its
stylistic emulation of the scribe it
so subtly parodied, was written has
tily, under pressure, and God forbid,
in all earnestness.
Now this is deplorable, certainly, j
and the discerning who salute you,
regret it; but not nearly so deeply j
as they lament the cruel and unjust j
contention of a slightly more in- j
telligent group who feel that in the j
teeth of a bona fide request for aid
and enlightenment you eleel to pro- I
duce a long-winded, satirical .shrug ;
and nothing more.
I don't for an instant begrudge :
you your fun, but now that you've !
had it, I await confidently and not !
too patiently your prompt and sin
cere attention to a real hunger and ;
need for an intelligent answer to j
Jane's letter.
Cordially.
