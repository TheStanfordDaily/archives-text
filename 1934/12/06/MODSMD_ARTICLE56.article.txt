# Pasadena Will See Alabama's 'Great' Eleven
## Card Opponent Boasts Five All-Star Players 
### 
The most resourceful of all Crim
son Tide elevens, featuring brilliant
punters, spectacular passers, and a
bone-crashing attack. That is how
the South is heralding its represen
tative to the Rose Bowl.
In 1930 the Alabama team that
• annihilated Washington State was a
superior team to the two elevens
that defeated Washington and came
from behind to tie Stanford in 1925
and 1926, respectively.
Yet the 1934 team under Frank
Thomas boasts a faster set of line
men and backs than the great 1930
eleven, which was considered the
greatest of all Southern aggrega
tions.
Millard Howell, the all-Ameri
can half-hack, on the Tide team
is considered the greatest triple
threat of all time. Howell has an
average of 44 yards per kick in
three years of punting and sur
passes even the great Johnny
"Hurry" Cain.
The 'Bama back has completed
31 out of 52 passes this year for
more than 500 yards, and has an
average of more than six yards for
every time he has run with the ball.
Johnny Angelich, Howell's running
mate, is a great back himself and
averages 40 yards on his kicks. His
performances do not show np simply
because he is unfortunate (o be in
the line-up with such a back as
Howell.
The Alabama ends have tre
mendous strength in Paul Bryant
and Don Hutson, who has been
named on several all-American
selections. Hutson weighs 195
pounds and steps the century in
9.8 seconds. One of the Tide's
pet scoring plays is ihc end
around with Hutson carrying the
ball. Bryant weighs 200 pounds
and runs the 100 in 10 seconds flat.
Bill Lee, tackle and captain of the
team is an outstanding player, while
Jim Whatley, 215 pounds and
standing 6 feet 5 inches, plays the
other tackle post almost to perfec
tion. Charley Marr, a 225-pound
guard, is practically immovable.
The Southern eleven has three
strong centers, and a wealth of
material to replace the veteran
linemen. The varsity has played
more than two periods in only one
game this season, which gives the
substitutes quite a bit of expe
rience. This year's Tide line av
erages 200 pounds, while there are
two 105 pounders in the backfield,
and two 190 pounders.
Five of the players have made ihe
majority of all-southeastern elevens,
with two more failing to make the
grade by a few votes. Thomas, coach
of the Crimson Tide, and eastern
critics feel that Alabama has the
greatest football team of «.il time!
and look to another victory for them j
in the Pasadena game.
