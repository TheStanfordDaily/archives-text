# DR. REINHARDT DIRECTS DRAMA
## German Folk Story Given Brilliant Portrayal 
### Cedric Larson 
A brilliant portrayal of rococco
eighteenth century Gorman court
life into which was woven a folk
lore theme, was given last night be
fore a packed house in the Little
Theater, by the dramatic class of
the German department, in the stag
ing of Heinrich Burhenne's celebrated
play "The Myrtle Princess." Dr.
Kurt Frank Reinhurdt directed the
presentation.
Annelies Morgan in the leading
role of the prince, arrayed in royal
velvet, gave an excellent masculine
impersonation. Her singing, ges
tures, and German pronunciation
were exceptional. Jane Robinson
played opposite the prince as the
Myrtle Princess, heroine of the
piece.
Action Good
Plenty of plot-action for the play
was furnished by Francisca Warncke,
Betty McGlashan, and Normandene
Biss, who were the jealous rivals of
the Myrtle Princess for the hand of
the prince.
Hans Leschke and Cedric Larson,
the two councillors, clothed in flow
ing robes and periwigs, seemed al
most to have stepped out of some
l'Bth century court room as they
came on the stage with measured,
legal tread.
Minor Holes
The humble artisan class of the
period was well portrayed in the
roles of the potter and his wife,
taken by Sydney Head and Isabel
Stowell. Ed Kilburn and Neil Ruge
were gardener and servant, respec
tively.
The lute was played for several
German songs by Hans Leschke,
while Lawrence Templeton and Wil
liam Pratt played French horns.
Settings for the play were done by
Waldemar Johansen. artist of note,
Stanford graduate, and now on the
faculty of Sequoia Union High
School.
