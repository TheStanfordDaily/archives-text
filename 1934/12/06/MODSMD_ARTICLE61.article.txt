## WE'RE UNPOPULAR WITH THE EAST 
### 
The Damon Runyon beagle waved unqualifiedly early this week in a
copyrighted article by Universal Service. It seems he doesn't think too
much of the Stanford football team.
He commended Stanford on her choice of Alabama as Rose Bowl
opponent* but made a few choice statements:
"Alabama, football champion of the South, and perhaps one of the
three best teams in the country, out-ranked only by Minnesota, and
possibly by Pitt, deserves this high honor. . . .
"Stanford deserves great credit for selecting Alabama as its op
ponent. though Stanford must be fully aware that it is quite likely to
take a sound beating from the Southerners....
"Football might have admired Stanford's nerve iji inviting Min
nesota had it been possible for Minrfesota to accept, but would have
questioned Stanford's judgment. "The Giants of the North," one of
the most powerful aggregations of all time, might have defeated
Stanford by a humiliating score.
"Alabama's score will be bad enough for Stanford. Minnesota's would
have been terrible....
"Eastern observers who have drifted West and seen Stanford say it
is apparently a big team, and looks rugged, but that it does not play
rugged football. It is not the rough, fighting type of team.
"Despite the fact that the result of the New Year's game between
Alabama and Stanford is a foregone conclusion, unless something
serious happens to Alabama between now and January 1, it will be a
grand game for the spectators."

We like the idea of the story, insomuch as it probably will be one of
the bases for rating Stanford an underdog against Alabama, but there
are a few questions.
If Pitt is so darned good, in the eastern scribe's opinion, why was it
the Pirates had so much harder time whipping U.S.C. than did St<Uiford?
The Trojans were fighting fully as hard against the Indians.
The only crack in the entire article that we could see any sense in
was that about the non-fighting, non-rough Stanford team. It has been
true so far this year. Stanford has never looked particularly fired-up for
a game; she hasn't needed to. The Indians had a tough, long schedule,
and could not afford to point for each game, that was pointed out early
in the year.
It is our own little opinion that Tiny Thornh ill's men will show
the long desired fight and pep in the New Year's game. We expected
it in the Big Game, hut all the injuries of the first quarter plus Mos
crip's uncalled for hurt prior to the game was just a trifle more than
the Stanford team could take all at once.
We would respect the opinion, as an opinion at least, of someone
who made the remarks that Mr. Runyon did—but only if that person had
watched Stanford in action this year. However, for an authority who
has not seen the Indians play all season those statements were too rash,
to say the least, to be read with more than humorous chuckles.
Possibly the peer of sports writers will sincerely wish he had con
fined his column to tiddly-winks, or at least to teams he had seen in
action, come January 2 of 1935.

true so far this year. Stanford has never looked particularly fired-up for
a game; she hasn't needed to. The Indians had a tough, long schedule,
and could not afford to point for each game, that was pointed out early
in the year.
It is our own little opinion that Tiny Thornh ill's men will show
the long desired fight and pep in the New Year's game. We expected
it in the Big Game, hut all the injuries of the first quarter plus Mos
crip's uncalled for hurt prior to the game was just a trifle more than
the Stanford team could take all at once.
We would respect the opinion, as an opinion at least, of someone
who made the remarks that Mr. Runyon did—but only if that person had
watched Stanford in action this year. However, for an authority who
has not seen the Indians play all season those statements were too rash,
to say the least, to be read with more than humorous chuckles.
Possibly the peer of sports writers will sincerely wish he had con
fined his column to tiddly-winks, or at least to teams he had seen in
action, come January 2 of 1935.
The Damon Runyon beagle waved unqualifiedly early this week in a
copyrighted article by Universal Service. It seems he doesn't think too
much of the Stanford football team.
He commended Stanford on her choice of Alabama as Rose Bowl
opponent* but made a few choice statements:
"Alabama, football champion of the South, and perhaps one of the
three best teams in the country, out-ranked only by Minnesota, and
possibly by Pitt, deserves this high honor. . . .
"Stanford deserves great credit for selecting Alabama as its op
ponent. though Stanford must be fully aware that it is quite likely to
take a sound beating from the Southerners....
"Football might have admired Stanford's nerve iji inviting Min
nesota had it been possible for Minrfesota to accept, but would have
questioned Stanford's judgment. "The Giants of the North," one of
the most powerful aggregations of all time, might have defeated
Stanford by a humiliating score.
"Alabama's score will be bad enough for Stanford. Minnesota's would
have been terrible....
"Eastern observers who have drifted West and seen Stanford say it
is apparently a big team, and looks rugged, but that it does not play
rugged football. It is not the rough, fighting type of team.
"Despite the fact that the result of the New Year's game between
Alabama and Stanford is a foregone conclusion, unless something
serious happens to Alabama between now and January 1, it will be a
grand game for the spectators."

We like the idea of the story, insomuch as it probably will be one of
the bases for rating Stanford an underdog against Alabama, but there
are a few questions.
If Pitt is so darned good, in the eastern scribe's opinion, why was it
the Pirates had so much harder time whipping U.S.C. than did St<Uiford?
The Trojans were fighting fully as hard against the Indians.
The only crack in the entire article that we could see any sense in
was that about the non-fighting, non-rough Stanford team. It has been
true so far this year. Stanford has never looked particularly fired-up for
a game; she hasn't needed to. The Indians had a tough, long schedule,
and could not afford to point for each game, that was pointed out early
