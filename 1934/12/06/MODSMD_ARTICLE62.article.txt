# ALL-AMERICANS MEET IN ROSE BOWL
## 
### 
It will bo u battle of individuals when Stanford meets Alabama New
Year's Day.
Both teams have three stars that have been alternating in various
all-American selections. And the three play at corresponding positions
on cach team.
.Monk Moscrip of Stanford *ave away all-star honors to Don Ilutson
of Alabama on some of the mythical elevens. Each plays end. and
there will bo some good rivalry there.
Bob Reynolds is an all-Amcrican tackle, and so is Bill Lcc of the
Crimson Tide. Then Bobby Grayson, an all-star ball packer end back
field ace, will meet Dixie Howrll, Crimson claim to ball carrying dis
tinction.
Here's another interesting little angle concerning Stanford's trio of
stars: Each was trained by an all-Amcrican in his own right, and on
this very campus.
(•rayson, although named as a quarterback, is in reality a fullback,
and he has learned much from Ernie Never*. Stanford's immortal
all-time all-Ameriran. Moscrip, an end. has received his tutoring
from Jim another ex-Stanford all-Ameriean. But I helieve
that has been mentioned before.
Then Reynolds, the .surprise portion of the Cardinal trio, crashed into
the national limelight, and it may be brought out that in his day genial
Coach Thornhill was one of the better tackles in the country; he played
for the Pitt Panthers.
Let's hire an all-Amcrican halfback, and maybe Bones Hamilton can
crash in some place. —Browne.
