## 
### Phil Duffy 
Deviating from the regular offen
sive and defensive drills every after
noon and holding more scrimmages
has given Coach John Bunn a better
opportunity to vied his basketball
players and at the sarrie time has
given the individual pbyers a chance
to prove their worth.
This year's practice sessions for
the varsity squad have been marked
by a series of active scrimmages.
Bunn feels that this system is bet
ter than a usual routine of drills and
.states that he has been able to get
a newer slant on his men during
these practice frays.
Bunn was impressed by the show
ing of the varsity against the
Y.M.C.A. team on Wednesday night,
and spoke favorably of the playing

of Bill Quade and Gordon Malla
tratt. The Indian mentor is also
pleased with the showing of both
Kenny Nobs and Kenneth Bell at
*he center position.
Bell is a smoother player and a
better shot than Nobs, but the lat
ter will probably Ret the first call
on the Eastern trip due to his rug
ged style of play. Nobs' height and
defensive work aid him greatly.
The squad has several ruggeo
players but they have not been using
this attribute to the best of theu
ability and are being replaced
.aster and smoother men. Coas.

Indian squad, the faster players will
get Bunn's call.
