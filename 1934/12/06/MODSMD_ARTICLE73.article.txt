# PROGRESS SLOW IN FALL TRACK
## 
### 
Midqtlarters, vacation, and nu
merous other interferences have
played considerable havoc with the
fall track practice of Coach Dink
Templeton s 1935 varsity. Coupled
with a small and irregular turnout,
the result is that the times and dis
tances made this fall are way below
the marks of the last few years.
On the other hand, California fall
meets have produced unusual early
season times, particularly in the
sprints, and Cal's long-awaited Big
Meet victory never looks surer than
at the present time.
Only in two departments can Stan
ford track followers feel elated over
fall marks—the discus and the high
jump. Transfers Hal King and Phil
Levy have been consistent around
the 145 and 150-foot marks in the
discus, and loom as regular point
winners next spring. Humbert
Smith's 6 feet 4% inches in the high
jump Tuesday ranks Smith as the
finest Card high jumper since Bob
King's day, and among the best on
the coast.
Middle-distance men, aside from
1.C.4-A. champ A1 Blackman, have
been registering but fair times. This
department will be temporarily
weakened when half-miler Joe Bur
ris undergoes a nose operation late
this week.
