Stanford rooters who saw the
midget football teams sponsored by
the Lions Club of Berkeley wilt
again see the 80-pounders scamper
around the gridiron in the prelim
inary to the Rosa Bowl game.
Funds have been raised by mem
bers and friends of the Lions Club
to finance the sending of the two
teams south to play' their fourth
game this season. The two teams,
named after their coaches, are known
as "Lumpe's Lions" and "McKevitt's
Lions."
Lumpe's team wears the red and

wholly of Japanese youngsters. The
blue jerseys belong *to McKevitt's
Lions.
The midget footballers displayed
their wares to Stanford fans in the
Northwestern and California pre

nese Lumps eleven, using intricate
spinners, laterals, and pass plays,
won 7-0.
