## 
### Bob Adams 
About two tons of paper are used
by Stanford students in a quarter.
At least two tons of paper are sold
each quarter by the bookstore, ac
cording to Mr. Stager, manager.
''Before school opened in October,
I ordered 5,000 pounds of paper and
I have now ordered 4,000 pounds
more for the beginning of the new
quarter," says Mr. Stager. "This
paper is bought from a concern in
Chicago and is cut and bundled by
the regular Bookstore staff. Various
tests to determine strength, ability to
take ink and erasures are made on
the paper."
Aside from textbooks, the Book
store sells more paper than anything
else. Notebooks come next. Mr.
Stager estimates that there are
1,000 new notebooks on the campus
this year. The majority of these are
leather and zipper types, for which
there was a great demand last Octo
ber.

"Business has picked up about 10
per cent this year. This is piobably
the result of the 10 per cent increase
in enrollment," continues Mr. Stager, j
He was unable to prophesy as to I
whether or not there would be a i
rebate coming to students at the end ;
of the year. "Of course, we can't tell j
a thing until after the end of the j
year, when we have had a chance j
to balance the books.
