### Loren Irwin 
A sellout! 1500 Rose Bowl tickets
sold by 3 o'clock yesterday after
noon; and approximately 150 stu
dents were greeted with "I'm sorry,
but there arc no more tickets."
After a desultory 300 tickets sold
on each of the first tv/o days of
ticket sale, the final day's sale of 900
came as a soothing balm to Rally
Committee Chairman Julius Jacobs'
hopes of a capacity rooting section
for the Rose Bowl game.
A1 Masters, graduate manager,
expressed great surprise at the
number of ducats sold, stating
that if demand for more tickets
is great enough, another group
will be printed and sold imme
ciiately.
Don Liebendorfer, director of pub
licity for the 8.A.C., will probably
leave for Pasadena some time today
where he will establish headquar
ters until after January 1. All rela
tions concerning publicity will be
carried out by Liebendorfer in an
attempt to fill the Bowl on New
Year's Day.

aPsadena and all business concern

Comment Challenged
At the same time, Coach Tiny and
his squad went quietly about their
job of preparing for their battle with
the Crimson Tide, displaying the

son.
Underlying this, however, was an
other toneâ€”one nf "So, we're not
rugged and tough enough for the
Eastern sports writers, huh! We'll
show 'em!"
The turnout was as yet slightly
skeletonized with Monk Most-rip,
Bobby Grayson, and Keith Top
ping still absent with their in
juries. All three will definitely be
ready to play in the Rose Bowl
game, however, according to Dr.
Fritz Roth.
With Stan Anderson missing for
reasons unknown, Ray Todd played
full back for the first string as it
went through some of Thornhill's
newly developed pet plays. Todd, a
little too ambitious, succeeded in
knocking the '"stuffings" out of a
sawdust "opposition end" toward the
close of the workout.
Johnny Reisner appeared in the
left halfback position, although Bob
Maentz and Buck Van Dellen were
on hand. Maentz was in his regular
uniform, taking lighter work, while
Van Dellen reported in civilian dress.
The latter was troubled with a
sprained ankle, suffered in Tues
day's intramural track meet as he
starred for the row in the pole vault,
his freshman love. "Darn fool,"
quoth track mentor Dink Templeton
as he "covered" football practice.
