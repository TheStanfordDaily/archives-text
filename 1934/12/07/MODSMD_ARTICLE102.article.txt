# Mike, Veteran Army Horse, Dies Quietly at Age of 25
## 
### BOB EISENBACH 
Mike ate, drank, and made merry ,
in his own dignified way yesterday, j
for his horse-sense told him thaL i
something big and terrible was go
ing to happen.
And though his hay was specially i
pitched and his stall was extra- i
clean, though it was his 25th birth
day and he received all the tribute j
that comes to an equine Caesar, j
Mike couldn't be fooled by a lot of ;
attention to an old army horse, even j
if he was the stable patriarch.
So when Mike "died today, a vic
tim of old age and a veteran of 15 j
years hard service on the Fitrm, it i
was no surprise to him. Stable at
taches say that he met the Dark
Angel with peace in his heart, for he j
had been accorded all the honors of j
horsedom during his life at the |
R.O.T.C. stables, and could look back i
on a career of high color and ro- j
mantic escapade—the only horse on
the Farm that could.
Mike's eulogist was Seigoant E.!
Paul Duncan, who has seen Mike do I
his stuff for four generations of i
Stanfordites, and who can recall in ;
glamorous detail his equine esca- !
pades since his arrival here in 1919 !
after wartime service in Camp
Kearney at San Diego.
"Four of his buddies came with :
Mike," Sergeant Duncan recalled. !
"They are Princeton, Scott, Bill, and
Jerry. But Mike was always the,
romantic renegade, and the leader of
the stable."
"He's had some mighty big high ,

, spots in his life. I don't suppose he
I ever forgot the time they dressed
him up like a horse, literally, and
| put him on the platform of Ihe Pa
| vilion during the 1931 pre-game
j rally for the Stanford-U.S.C. game,
i He was supposed to be the Trojan
i horse, but that didn't go with Mike
1 at, all. Just to show 'em what a
j real Stanford horse can be, he re
j fused to budge from his perch when
I the rally was over. We had to call
i out half the detachment and prac
i tically carry him off."
"Then there was the time Ihat he
j was borrowed by the Paly High
j boys for a picnic. Mike pulled a
| loaded wagon into the hills to the
picnic grounds all right, but he ate
i every bit of the lunch before they
j could get him under control."
| Versatile? Mike could do any
j Ihing, in Sergeant Duncan's opinion,
j To prove it, he hauled out Mike's
j polo record, one of nine years' ex
j tent, which showed that he trained
! two Stanford captains, Thompson
I and Vanderburg, on his patient back.
"There was only one thing that
ever really embarrassed him," Ser
-1 geant Duncan believes. "That was
j back in '25 when some boys painted
him up as a zebra and staked him
| on a sorority lawn. He never forgot
! that indignity."
"In retaliation, he invariably
| threw Sunday riders as soon as he
i was out of the stables. Was he smart?
I'll say. Mike couldn't read, but
he knew what God told Adam about
i the seventh day."

"He's had some mighty big high ,

, spots in his life. I don't suppose he
I ever forgot the time they dressed
him up like a horse, literally, and
| put him on the platform of Ihe Pa
| vilion during the 1931 pre-game
j rally for the Stanford-U.S.C. game,
i He was supposed to be the Trojan
i horse, but that didn't go with Mike
1 at, all. Just to show 'em what a
j real Stanford horse can be, he re
j fused to budge from his perch when
I the rally was over. We had to call
i out half the detachment and prac
i tically carry him off."
"Then there was the time Ihat he
j was borrowed by the Paly High
j boys for a picnic. Mike pulled a
| loaded wagon into the hills to the
picnic grounds all right, but he ate
i every bit of the lunch before they
j could get him under control."
| Versatile? Mike could do any
j Ihing, in Sergeant Duncan's opinion,
j To prove it, he hauled out Mike's
j polo record, one of nine years' ex
j tent, which showed that he trained
! two Stanford captains, Thompson
I and Vanderburg, on his patient back.
"There was only one thing that
ever really embarrassed him," Ser
-1 geant Duncan believes. "That was
j back in '25 when some boys painted
him up as a zebra and staked him
| on a sorority lawn. He never forgot
! that indignity."
"In retaliation, he invariably
| threw Sunday riders as soon as he
i was out of the stables. Was he smart?
I'll say. Mike couldn't read, but
he knew what God told Adam about
i the seventh day."

Mike ate, drank, and made merry ,
in his own dignified way yesterday, j
for his horse-sense told him thaL i
something big and terrible was go
ing to happen.
And though his hay was specially i
pitched and his stall was extra- i
clean, though it was his 25th birth
day and he received all the tribute j
that comes to an equine Caesar, j
Mike couldn't be fooled by a lot of ;
attention to an old army horse, even j
if he was the stable patriarch.
So when Mike "died today, a vic
tim of old age and a veteran of 15 j
years hard service on the Fitrm, it i
was no surprise to him. Stable at
taches say that he met the Dark
Angel with peace in his heart, for he j
had been accorded all the honors of j
horsedom during his life at the |
R.O.T.C. stables, and could look back i
on a career of high color and ro- j
mantic escapade—the only horse on
the Farm that could.
Mike's eulogist was Seigoant E.!
Paul Duncan, who has seen Mike do I
his stuff for four generations of i
Stanfordites, and who can recall in ;
glamorous detail his equine esca- !
pades since his arrival here in 1919 !
after wartime service in Camp
Kearney at San Diego.
