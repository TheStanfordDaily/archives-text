# Menlo Beer Merchants Rue State Court's Ruling
## Revenue in Menlo Will Be Cut $5,000 by Lost Liquor Sale 
### 
What will the results of the state
Supreme Court's ruling on alcoholic
beverages be, to the numerous beer
parlors and liquor shops within a
mile and a half of Stanford?
To those on the lucky side of an
imaginary line, it will mean increased
business, but to the Menlo merchants
the definite ruling is a minor trag
edy. As one of the leading liquor
merchants in the town explained:
"By gosh, it means we will all
go out of business. The law takes
in the whole town, and there's
nothing to be done about it. It
will mean a bunch of empty build
ings in the town, bootleg joints all
over again, and a loss of $5,000
revenue yearly for iMenlo Park.
All this loss will have to be ab
sorbed by taxpayers and property
owners."
Happier than the Menlo met chants
were those in the town who carried
on bootleg joints during prohibition.
"They have no worriesâ€”they don't
care when the town becomes dry, j
because they made more money dur
ing prohibition than they do now.
They will simply reopen again fori
illegal business."
Continuing along the highway, I
sentiment changed noticeably to that 1
of indifference, and even enthusiasm,
particularly outside the mile-and-a
half boundaries. One establishment
located on the very border-line of
the present limit had the following
philosophy on the new set-up.
"We've had our property sur
veyed by engineers on three differ
ent occasions, and wc still don't j
know where we stand. According
to the present limit, our shop is I
right 011 the border line. If they
change the limits, we'll simply |
move groceries into this shop, and 1
put our main store 011 the other !
side of the line."
This establishment consisted of a
chain of buildings strung ou* along
the highway, evidently prepared for
any contingency.
But up and down the highway, the
ieeling was one of bewilderment, j
No one knew just what was happen- j
ing, even less about where the mile
and-a-half would be measured
from, and they all concluded: "If
people want to drink, a mile and a
half doesn't mean anything in an
automobile anyhow."
