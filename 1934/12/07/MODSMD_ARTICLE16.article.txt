# RED GRIDIRON MACHINES WILL TANGLE JAN. 1
## Cards, Alabama Will Enter Game Unscouted And On Even Terms 
### Millard Browne 
Southern California may be paint-,
ed red New Year's Eve. That's not
news.
But one particular portion of the
land of liquid sunshine—Pasadena
—will have red as its motif right
on through New Year's Day in
varying shades when the Cardinal
of Stanford meets the Crimson of
Alabama in the climax to that
city's annual classic known as the
Tournament of Roses.
Yes, it will be a red-letter day in
the gridiron history of one oi these
two exponents of sectional football
potency when Tiny Thomhill's In
dians, champion of all that territory
west of the Rocky Mountains, at
tempt to settle several matters with
the best of the ol' South.
For this particular classic there
are no signs of the usual bases of
comparison. There are no compara
tive scores, very few fans have even
seen both teams play, and neither
eleven has been scouted by the other.
I But still the odds range somewhat
even.
Offense vs. Card Defense
Alabama is a particularly strong
offensive team, which considers the
j best defense a big, early scoring lead.
| The Cardinals will match this with
the best defensive eleven in national
football today. That .should produce
something.
And so on down the line the
two are compared, with newspaper
reports and partisan claims on the
j part of each as the only basis for
j (his comparison. So Stanford
, might win by three touchdowns,
and the Crimson Tide may win by
21 points.
After spending a lot of good play
ers in winning the Big Game, Stan
ford looks forward once more to en
tering a game at full physical
[strength on January 1. The entire
j Card line-up will be back, probably
in perfect form, including ail-Amer
ican Bobby Grayson, Monk Moscrip,
and Keith Topping, present cripples.
No Practice Christmas
The Indian team will practice to
day and three days next week be
fore laying off in favor of final ex
aminations. After finals, Stanford
j men will begin the more serious
I preparations for the Tide invasion
jof Pasadena's Rose Bowl, working
I out every day until December 24,
j when many of them will go home for
I Christmas.

Unless something goes wrong
with present plans, the Indians
will line up against the Tide with
Most rip and Topping at the ends,
Bol) Reynolds arid Claude Calla
way tackles. Woody Adain.s and
Larry Rouble guards, Wes IVlullcr
center, Frank Alustiza quarter,
Bones Hamilton and Buck Van
Dcllen or Boh Maentz halfbacks,
and Bob Grayson fullback.
