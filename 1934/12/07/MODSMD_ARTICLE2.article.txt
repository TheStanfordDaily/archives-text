# Departmental Lectures Set
## 
### 
For students .still uncertain about
choice of a major subject, or upper
classmen desiring information of
vocational opportunities after grad
uation, the Vocational Guidance
Committee announces a new edition
of last year's Department Lecture
Series.
According to Charles Gâ€ž Wrenn,
assistant registrar and committee
head, 1145 enthusiastic students at
tended last year's talks. Half of them
were members of the upper divi
sion.
"The unexpectedly large student
response, we think, justifies repeti
tion," commented Wrenn. He added
that the lectures will resemble, but
not duplicate, those of the original
series.
