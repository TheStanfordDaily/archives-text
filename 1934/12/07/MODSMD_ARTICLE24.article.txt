# Newhall's Sudden Death Ends Active Career as Trustee
## Blindness Fails To Curtail Activities of Aged Board Member 
### 
By John McClelland
William Mayo Newhall, for 22
years a member of Stanford's Board
of Trustees, died sudenly in the
Stanford Hospital in San Francisco
at 5 o'clock yesterday morning.
Mr. Newhall, 75 years old, was the
oldest member of the board. His
death came on the very day when
he planned to attend a .regular
Trustees' meeting. After being re
moved from his home to the hospital
Wednesday, he was unable to rally.
No one of the Trustees was bet
ter known to Stanford than Mr.
Newhall. He was the one member
who could be counted 011 to be pres
ent at nearly every University func -
tion. Although almost totally blind
during the last years of his life, Mr.
Newhall was one of the most active
members of the board. His charac
ter and his work are well described
by President Ray Lyman Wilbur in
a statement made yesterday after
noon:
"When Mr. Newhall became a
Stanford Trustee, he made the
University his one primary in
terest He carried forward his
large personal responsibilities, but
was ever ready to push (hem aside
for the problems of the University.
When lie was suddenly faced with
the fact that he must live in com
parative darkness following an
operation that brought back very
limited eyesight, he met the situ
ation with such undaunted cour
age and kindly optimism that he
won the affection and admiration
of all.
"Stanford University has lost
one of its greatest friends."
Mr. Newhall was a member of one
of the oldest families in San Fran
cisco and was a graduate of Yale
University. Of great service to the
University was his knowledge of
California land which was of great
help to the University in its disposal
of some of its landholdings.
Mr. Newhall was the widower of
the late Elizabeth S. Newhall. He
is survived by three daughters and
one son, and a number of relatives.
There will be a private funeral
for Mr. Newhall at Trinity Episcopal
Church in San Francisco at two
o'clock this afternoon.
