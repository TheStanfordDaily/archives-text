j A native San Franciscan, Miss!
i Crawford began writing dramatic j
j sketches four years ago after re- I
| turning from a round-the-world j
j cruise in which she gathered mate- '

; in folk music and the characterize- !
' tics of different racial groups whom '
i she studied.
j Miss Crawford, who originally in- j
| tended to become a musician, studied â– 
i in New York for three years under j
] Rubin Goldmark. She made an
eastern tour last winter, appearing
! throughout New York and New
England. So enthusiastically re- '
ceived were her programs that she j
has been engaged to cover the same
route, as well as additional U rritory.!
next spring.
! One of Miss Crawford's most popu- ;
lar characterizations is that "of Rosa, j
| an old Italian fisher-woman who has I
i plied her trade for many years along j
; San Francisco's Fisherman's Wharf. 1
