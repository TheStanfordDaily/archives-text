# "HER MASTER'S VOICE" CHOSEN AS NEXT PLAY
## Tryouts for Comedy To Be Tuesday, Wednesday In Little Theatre WAS BROADWAY HIT Stanford Cast To Give First Western Showing 
### Annalee Whitmore 
From last night's stormy three
hour session of Dramatic Council
emerged "Her Master's Voice" as
final choice for winter quarter's play.
All the ingredients necessary for
one of the most pretentious, fast
moving dramas yet presented on tho
campus are contained in this last
year Broadway box-office hit.
Selected as one of the two best
comedies playing in New York last,
saason, the farce is the work of Clare
Kummer. Burns Mantle selected it
as one of the headliners in his "Best
Plays."
Tryouts will be held this quar
ter. Tuesday and Wednesday of
next week, in the Little Theatre,
Director William Murray Tinnnons
will supervise competition for
roles from 4 to (5 o'clock.
Runners-up for Council's final
choice were "Rebound," stage and
screen hit, and George Bernard
Shaw's "Major Barbara."
Characters are lor the most part
youthful. Almost equal distribution
between men and women dramatists
makes the cast unusually well-bal
anced, with all roles suitable to col
lege actors.
I'la.v lias "Punch"
Clever lines and comical situations
abound. ' The play contains more
punch than any other we've ever
been able to present," comment
Council members.
Two acts, with many scenes, con
stitute division of action of the un
usual farce. Scenery is being out
lined tentatively under the super
vision of Technical Director George
Andreini, who refuses to divulge
plans.
The plot concerns a would -be
opera singer, married to a radio star,
whose thwarted aspirations to fame
and fortune threaten her happiness.
Her aunt, who financed a European
trip in anticipation of the niecc's ca
reer, is also dissatisfied.
Situations Farcical
Subsequent complications in which
the husband masquerades as a gar
dener on the aunt's country estate
develop into one of the most de
liciously farcical situations ever
staged.
" 'Her Master's Voice' is, actually,
one of the most outstanding presen
tations ever obtained for Stanford,"
comments Frank. He adds that the
Stanford interpretation will be prob
ably thr first Western performance.

All officially registered students,
with the exception of freshman
women, are eligible for tryouts Tues
day and Wednesday.

Stanford interpretation will be prob

From last night's stormy three
hour session of Dramatic Council
emerged "Her Master's Voice" as
final choice for winter quarter's play.
All the ingredients necessary for
one of the most pretentious, fast
moving dramas yet presented on tho
campus are contained in this last
year Broadway box-office hit.
Selected as one of the two best
comedies playing in New York last,
saason, the farce is the work of Clare
Kummer. Burns Mantle selected it
as one of the headliners in his "Best
Plays."
Tryouts will be held this quar
ter. Tuesday and Wednesday of
next week, in the Little Theatre,
Director William Murray Tinnnons
will supervise competition for
roles from 4 to (5 o'clock.
Runners-up for Council's final
choice were "Rebound," stage and
screen hit, and George Bernard
Shaw's "Major Barbara."
Characters are lor the most part
youthful. Almost equal distribution
between men and women dramatists
makes the cast unusually well-bal
anced, with all roles suitable to col
lege actors.
I'la.v lias "Punch"
Clever lines and comical situations
abound. ' The play contains more
punch than any other we've ever
been able to present," comment
Council members.
Two acts, with many scenes, con
stitute division of action of the un
usual farce. Scenery is being out
lined tentatively under the super
vision of Technical Director George
Andreini, who refuses to divulge
plans.
The plot concerns a would -be
opera singer, married to a radio star,
whose thwarted aspirations to fame
and fortune threaten her happiness.
Her aunt, who financed a European
trip in anticipation of the niecc's ca
reer, is also dissatisfied.
Situations Farcical
Subsequent complications in which
the husband masquerades as a gar
dener on the aunt's country estate
develop into one of the most de
liciously farcical situations ever
staged.
" 'Her Master's Voice' is, actually,
one of the most outstanding presen
tations ever obtained for Stanford,"
comments Frank. He adds that the
Stanford interpretation will be prob
ably thr first Western performance.

All officially registered students,
