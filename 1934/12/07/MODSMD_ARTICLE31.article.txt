# Funny Thing What Laws Can Do
## 
### 
California legislators spent a good deal of
liino in ;i most important session once upon a
time. Net result left Stanford and other uni
versities wondering what to do about a law
which says that no intoxicating liquors may
he sold within a mile and a halt of any
campus.
Merchants, always anxious to please, finally
interpreted the edict hy measuring the dis
tance from the Administration Building, here
011 the Farm, and thus the good old Stanford
Hough could get his root and coca cola
across the bridge on the main highway.
A most peculiar thing happened. Before
repeal, at the height of prohibition, there were
many quiet little establishments hidden away
in the darker corners wherein dwell the in
gratiating proprietors of those curious shops
known as "speakeasies." With the opening of
public drinking parlors, the shady places
pulled the curtains, folded, and went oil' to
more legitimate fields.
The public spots near the Stanford coinpus
received their share of patronage, of course,
but the unusual feature of the affair lies in
the fact thai Stanford students are not as
noticeable in numbers at these places as they
were ii) former .days at the undercover es
tablishments.
Last week, a Supreme Court ruling defi
nitely set the boundaries back to a mile and a
half from the outer limits of the campus.
Befreshment parlors near the campus must
close, the order demands. Menlo Park alone
will lose an estimated civic income from
license, etc., of $.">,OOO from this move.
Certainly, these places will close. Thev will
bar the doors, and move on up or down the
highway some seven thousand feet, where they
will reopen under better and more attractive
conditions. Those who enjoy light liquors
will not mind the refreshing drive of five
minutes duration. Â«
Speakeasies will again pop into the front,
as popular hideaways reopen for the seeker
of forbidden fruit. It is probable that these
establishments will even regain some of their
loriner allure and sham popularity.
And only because of a law which in effect
means nothing, does nothing, and can be inter
preted two ways bv you and bv me.
