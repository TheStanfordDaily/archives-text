A lew short weeks of holiday merriment
and President Roosevelt will once more have
Congress on his hands, as President Cleveland
used to say. With Roosevelt, however, it is
more often a ease of Congress being under the
Ihiunh of the President rather than on his
hands.
I'ndceided, vacillating, and fearful <>f losing
their jobs, members of Congress were only too
willing hisl year to surrender their powers
to a bold, resolute leader who knew what he
wanted and how to get it.
Roosevelt will still dominate the present
Congress, fortunately for the country. Rut
benevolent dielalorship will not endure for
ever. Demagogues are already arising. There
is a growing realization that Congress cannot
permanently surrender ils powers. Capable
individual leadership is a rare thing that will
not always be available. Therefore it behooves
Corfgress l<* begin assuming ils fair share of
( I the burden. II mistakes are made in succeed
ing months, the President alone is not to be
blamed. People are going to wonder just
where Congress was while all this was going

The new Congress is faced with :i re
sponsibility ol' restoring intelligent, parlia
mentary consideration to its rightful place
in Ihe sun, without, at the same time, in
dulging in purely obstructive tactics. If it
fails, then the few remaining vestiges of
democracy in this world of ours might as
well slip silently into the shadows, whither
they arc even now all too rapidly drifting.
