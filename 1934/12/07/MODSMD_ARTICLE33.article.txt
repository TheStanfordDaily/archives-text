I hat K'nglish courses in colleges are lagging
far behind Ihe limes is Ihe contention of
Professor AI wood Townsliend of New York
I Diversity. Speaking before a convention

of teachers of English literature in Washing
ton, Townshend revealed some interesting
data on the relative appreciation ol' professors
and sludenls. According to liiin the edueators
are just ,TS years behind the classes.
The live novels most commonly assigned
by the professors are: Pride and Prejudice,
Hcturn ol the Native, The Scarlet Letter,
Henry Ksmond, and Vanity Fair. Their
median date of publication is IMMU.
The live works preferred by the students
are: The" Forsyte Saga, Arrowsmith, Of ilti
man Bondage, The (iood Earth, and The
Iteturn of the Native. Their median date of
publication is 1924.
Hut the teaching professors are compara
tively modern; those who plan the course of
studies in English departments dote on such
ancient obscurities as the authors
Farquhar, and Wyeherly, of whom Professor
Franklin Snyder of Northwestern, also speak
ing at the convention said. "I would as soon
listen to rain on a tin roof."
For all but the historical scholar, these
antiquities might well be eliminated. The
student of style and technique, as well as he
who is merely interested in art, can find enjoy
ment and instruction in more modern sources.
