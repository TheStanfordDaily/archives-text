# Step Off the Quad
## 
### 
And now about smoking. There is a tradi
tion on the Farm which frowns on all who
are guilty of smoking on the Quad. It was
Mrs. Stanford's earnest request that this
area be unmarred by cigarette butts, much less
lipsticked butts.
With finals approaching rapidly it would
be well to remember that classrooms are a
part of the Quad' and that smoking during
examinations would not only be a violation
of the traditional but a discourtesy to those
students who do not smoke.
For those Heads who must have their pull's
they are privileged to leave the classrooms at
anytime. Bui there is no excuse for sub
jecting one's fellow students to a smoke-filled
room.
