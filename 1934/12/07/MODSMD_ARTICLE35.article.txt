# "Her Master's Voice"

### 
Followers of the campus drama will be
given what promises to be an outstanding
treat in the way of current popular Broadway
hits with the production of "Her Master's
Voice" by director William Murray Timinons
early next quarter.
One of the "ten best" plays of last year, not
having been seen on the Coast yet, and still to
appear in pictures, "Her Master's Voice" un
doubtedly will tax the facilities of the As
sembly Hall, already jammed to standing
room during the 1934 Big Came Gaieties.
