# "INS" AND THE "OUTS"
## BURYING THE BLUE EAGLE 
### CROMPTON BANGS, Jr 
BOSTON, Mass., Oec. 6. —Thanksgiving has come
and gone; so has the family turkey. Once a proud bird
with lots of luscious white meat, it passed through the
succeeding stages of hash, salad, and soup, leaving
nothing but bones. Certainly it ought to be given a
decent burial. The same goes for the Blue Eagle.
It is only a young bird as birds go, but it lias
had an eventful life. Born only a year and a half
ago, it grew faster and bigger than any bird before
or since. In fact, when it was only two months old
it spread its wings with General Johnson on the
right, and "Robbie" on the left and set out on a
propaganda flight.
Soon everybody thought the millenium was just
around the corner, that Capital and Labor would lie
down like the lion and the lamb, and all the jobless
would miraculously find work.
But just like other birds that grow up too fast,,
it tried to do too much too soon and got the pip. In
spite of Doctor Johnson's best efforts, it contracted a
bad case of code fever. All the Democratic bird doc
tors said they didn't know what brought it on, but
outside specialists suspected the Blue Eagle had been
trying to digest too many big and little industrial codes
in too much of a hurry. Probably been bolting its
food in order to eat more and get still bigger, they said.
Then complications set in—strike complications
of the worst kind and all over its body, just like
the chickenpox. When last seen, the Blue Eagle
was still scratching its section 7A, getting sicker
and sicker all the time.
But this Ls not the end of the story. The other bird
doctors said Doctor Johnson talked too much and too
loudly about his patient. So they persuaded the Great
White Father to kick Doctor Johnson upstairs in a
friendly way and file him there for future reference.
But they were sorry; they found out General Johnson
was the Blue Eagle's soul. Without him there was
nothing but hash, salad, then soup, then very thin
soup. Now there are only the bones of the NBA staff
in the Commerce Building in Washington, sitting
around waiting to be the Blue Eagle's pallbearers. And
in the White House the Great White Father is still
hoping for reincarnation.
The whole point of all this is that the NltA has
outlived its usefulness. It is pretty generally ad
mitted that its only good features were the wages
and hours for labor and the practical elimination
of child labor. Collective bargaining was a good
idea, but 7A was too indefinite, and the A. F. of L.
was in too much of a hurry. So was the codification
of the big industries—if enough policemen were
around.
But when the Blue Eagle's wings spread out over
all the pants-pressers and dry cleaners in the land,
fixed their prices and cracked down on them, th;it
was too much. Especially when the big companies
went scot free for much worse violations.
Naturally, the whole complicated mess soono cracked
under its own weight, from the top down and from the
bottom up. With General Johnson gone it collapsed
completely. Now there is nothing to do but bury it as
a valuable experiment in government. And it didn't
even lay a golden egg.

ago, it grew faster and bigger than any bird before
or since. In fact, when it was only two months old
it spread its wings with General Johnson on the
right, and "Robbie" on the left and set out on a
propaganda flight.
Soon everybody thought the millenium was just
around the corner, that Capital and Labor would lie
down like the lion and the lamb, and all the jobless
would miraculously find work.
But just like other birds that grow up too fast,,
it tried to do too much too soon and got the pip. In
spite of Doctor Johnson's best efforts, it contracted a
bad case of code fever. All the Democratic bird doc
tors said they didn't know what brought it on, but
outside specialists suspected the Blue Eagle had been
trying to digest too many big and little industrial codes
in too much of a hurry. Probably been bolting its
food in order to eat more and get still bigger, they said.
Then complications set in—strike complications
of the worst kind and all over its body, just like
the chickenpox. When last seen, the Blue Eagle
was still scratching its section 7A, getting sicker
and sicker all the time.
But this Ls not the end of the story. The other bird
doctors said Doctor Johnson talked too much and too
loudly about his patient. So they persuaded the Great
White Father to kick Doctor Johnson upstairs in a
friendly way and file him there for future reference.
But they were sorry; they found out General Johnson
was the Blue Eagle's soul. Without him there was
nothing but hash, salad, then soup, then very thin
soup. Now there are only the bones of the NBA staff
in the Commerce Building in Washington, sitting
around waiting to be the Blue Eagle's pallbearers. And
in the White House the Great White Father is still
hoping for reincarnation.
The whole point of all this is that the NltA has
outlived its usefulness. It is pretty generally ad
mitted that its only good features were the wages
and hours for labor and the practical elimination
of child labor. Collective bargaining was a good
idea, but 7A was too indefinite, and the A. F. of L.
was in too much of a hurry. So was the codification
of the big industries—if enough policemen were
around.
But when the Blue Eagle's wings spread out over
all the pants-pressers and dry cleaners in the land,
fixed their prices and cracked down on them, th;it
was too much. Especially when the big companies
went scot free for much worse violations.
Naturally, the whole complicated mess soono cracked
under its own weight, from the top down and from the
bottom up. With General Johnson gone it collapsed
completely. Now there is nothing to do but bury it as
a valuable experiment in government. And it didn't
even lay a golden egg.
BOSTON, Mass., Oec. 6. —Thanksgiving has come
and gone; so has the family turkey. Once a proud bird
with lots of luscious white meat, it passed through the
succeeding stages of hash, salad, and soup, leaving
nothing but bones. Certainly it ought to be given a
decent burial. The same goes for the Blue Eagle.
It is only a young bird as birds go, but it lias
had an eventful life. Born only a year and a half
ago, it grew faster and bigger than any bird before
or since. In fact, when it was only two months old
it spread its wings with General Johnson on the
