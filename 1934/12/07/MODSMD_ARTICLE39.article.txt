FINALS, FROSH, FIGHT 'EM

Three months ago, dear freshmen, !
you came to Stanford presumably to !
start soaking yourself in the tepid
bath of higher education. First you i
moistened your forehead, tip of the
nose, and ears with little droplets of
Cit. Then you split up in many
directions to take .sponge baths in
Chem, Biology, History, English,
and whatnot. Just as you were get
ting used to that, a very wet wash
rag hit you squarely in the face, and
a hollow voice intoned: Midquarters.
That was not too pleasant. But you
have yet to learn that you are all
wet: finals are coming.
Those of you who have taken
European history have thought that
the Inquisition was long since over.
But Inquisition nor Hell know no j
fury like Finals Week.
EDUCATION and FINAL,S defi
nitely do not mix. Yet all know that
the latter, and many think that the
former too exists at Stanford. Edu
cation and finals live side by side
in a sort of colloidal state, each re
fusing to give in to the other, each
working fo defeat the other. Finals
are admittedly bad. Most professors
hate to give them. Everyone hafos to
take them. No one likes them but
those who insist on branding every
one for purposes of petty classifica
tion.
Still, though finals are anathema
to all and a real blessing to none,
everyone submits. Generations of
Stanford students have learned :hat
there are certain ways of taking
finals, not definitely better, but at
least less ineffective than other
ways:
1. STRESS MICROSCOPIC DE
TAIL: All quarter you have been
trying to grasp certain fundamental
principles. Now is the time to for

i get them. The minute, the tiny, the
obscure, are (he things that finals i
are made of. Two petty details are'
j worth one general principle on any
final. Details give points. Hit details.
2. GIVE AUTHORS AND TITLES:
Anyone who enters a final room
without having first looked through
the last pages of the sj llabus
(bibliography) is tempting the fates.'
Authors and titles lend a certain
classical coloring to a blue bock that
cannot fail to please—unless you
have memorized the wrong list.
3. PAT THE PROFESSOR: Au
thors and titles of other books are;
good, but no author is as good as the
professor, and no tkle is as worth
while as the title of his bcok, or j
direct references to his lectures. For
wll their sophistication, even profes
sors are human.
4. WRITE PLAINLY: There are
some benighted souls who still make
a hybrid cross between an "E" and
"I whenever they are in doubt about'
the correct letter, or write rather
confusedly whenever they are in
doubt about the correct answer. That
went out with bustles. Nothing so i
arouses the suspicion of a grader as
| such simple stuff. Straightforward
presentation is much more per,sua- ■
; sive, even if it is totally wrong.

There is more, much more that
all your friends will be happy to tell
you. There is only one catch. If you
all take this advice, and all cover
more "points," then you will all be
just as bad off as before. For if you
do better, you still get stuck on the
"bell curve." which permits only
small quantities of "A'.s,'' "B's,"'
| "C's." etc.
Still, you can take a chance on
trying this system, for most of you
will not use it. If that is clear to
you, you are entitled to a Merry
1 Christmas.
