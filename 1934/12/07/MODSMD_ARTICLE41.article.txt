AN AGED CUSTOM HOBS UP
AGAIN: The "Best" Films
(Continued from yesterday)

I Was a Spy, because it is a deeply
human and sincerely touching pic
i ture of human failings, rather than
because it is a tale of spies; The
Kid because it is perhaps the most
memorable of Chaplin's films: and
an excellent example of his comic
method; Little Women for the tastv
of its faithful adaptation and the
delicate portrayal of its sturdy sen
timentality.
Love Me Tonight for the excep
tional synchronization of mood and
humor in music as well as dialogue
and action and for the imaginative
I hand of Rouben Mamoulian in that
synchronization; Mata Marl for the
unhistorical but tragic dignity with
1 which Garbo endowed the role of the
weary courtesan and so dominated
the contrasting shoddy melodra
, matics of the film's physical action. '
Mickey Mouse and the Silly
Symphonies because, as semi-real
istic fantasies, they are deliciously
deserving of their popularity; be
cause they are maintained on so
high a plane in contrast tc their
competitors; The Old Dark House
because its ghastly if unimportant
progress was firm and subtle, as
well as straightforward.
Payment Deferred because, mas
querading as a tale of crime, it is
a finely acted tragedy, handled
without ostentation or exaggera
tion; She Done Him Wrong be
cause it recaptures in unsentimental i
terms the dubious glamours of a
bygone age; because Mae West here
presents a universal character, at
once type and individual, and repre
sents that character from a realistic
viewpoint hitherto ignored by the
films; Trouble in Paradise as an
exquisitely turned high comedy, the
method of which was a bathetic re
production of standard sccnes of
sentimentality; as well, for its witty
use of musical accompaniment.
Topaze, because the screen ver
sion was not only better than the
various stage versions, but the trag
edy of lost self-esteem, sincei'ely
acted, by John Barrymore; Reunion
in Vienna as an extraordinarily bril
liant and subtlq, satiric comedy, ex
quisitely made; Zwci Hertzen in
Takt because of the persistence j
and simplicity of its charm, particu- !
larly in contrast to the grossness and '
vulgarity of American musical films.
Among good films, excluded from
the list for reasons too long to de- j
tail, are: The The Guards
man. Twentieth Century, The Great
Jasper, Morning Glory, Street Scene,
Design for Living, Madchen in Uni
form, Zwci Menschen, I Am a Fugi
tive from a Chain Gang, Silver
Dollar.
Purposely omitted are George Ar
liss, for his persistent repetition of j
a single and tiring character; Marie
Dressier for occasionally very mov
ing but generally far too sentimental
films; a number of films which I
have reason to believe are fine but
have not seen, including Siegfried
Hallelujah. Maedchen in Uniform.
