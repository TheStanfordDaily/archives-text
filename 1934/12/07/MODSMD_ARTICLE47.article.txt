# CAMPUS OPINION

### 
The Edilty, Sir:
Congratulations on your editorial.
I "Music in the Spring," favoring an
j other all-campus musical. A good
Junior Opera, whfch everyone
knows wasn't an opera at all—but
was good fun, would revive a worthy
Stanford tradition.
Dne with fitting production val
ues (the cheapness of which was
one of the major faults of the recent
Gaieties) and presented on the Fri
day before the Big Meet, it would
do much to balance the dramatic
budge* as well as give the student
body a typical show of real personal
interest.
If we are to have another Junior
Opera, the decision must come soon.
The Dramatic Council meets in a
few days. The issue is before them;
let us hope they face it squarely.

The Editor, Sir:
The opinion of some few hundred
students unjustifiably emable to ob
tain rooters' tickets last Wednesday
seems to be one and the same.
The selling out of the 1,500 root
! ers' tickets before the allotted time 1
I of sale could not be helped, for the
| demands for such is sometimes hard :
to judge. j

That is beside the point. Our ar- !
, gument is for the immediate remedy i
• of the situation by printing more!
1 roo'ers' tickets, ar d thus giving j
? every loyal Stanford student a chance j
L to purchase one, especially when he l
r is unable to do so during the allotted I
j time of sale, for reasons not his own. j
■ This is the right granted every stu- 1
; dent upon paying his tuition fee at!
t Stanford. It should not be denied i
■ him.
I If the present situation is not rem- J
: edied, we would hate to think of 1
; | the feeling which might be aroused
. should the public be seen sitting I
where many rooters might have sat.'
I I Every student who wants to sec
j the famous New Year's classic and
. 1 root for his alma mater should be
given ample and proper opportunity
to buy a rooter's ticket. We rest
i the case with student opinion. We j
! demand action. Rooters' tickets —
please. B. R.
j The Editor, Sir:
Didn't the Stanford band and the
1 Stanford rooting section attend the :
' Big Game this year?
Or, did the Associated Oil Com
pany neglect to install microohone; j
: on the Stanford side of the field?
