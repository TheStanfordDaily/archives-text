# BALZER SCORES HIT IN MOLIERE PLAY READING
## 
### PHIL BERNHEIM 
Last night's Little Theatre audi- '
ence witnessed what was by far the
most outstanding dramatic perform
ance on the campus this year: i
Robert Balzer's portrayal of Harpa
gon in Sword and Sandals' reading j
of Moliere's "The Miser." His char
acterization of the grasping miser
was so good that it delighted the I
entire audience, excelling in the
scene where he discovers {hat his'
fortune has been stolen.
Rendering their usual talenicd per
formances, James Benet, Jean Al
bertson, and Shelley Smith contrib
uted in no small degree to the eve
ning's entertainment. Benet played
the dashing young hero with gusto,
while Albertson and Smith were the
charming young heroines (not difli- ,
cult roles for them). Dick Dawson,
"co-hero" along with Benet, was
more than satisfying.
The play itself is wittily satirical, i

' Although not including the number
of gag lines and belly-laughs which
, modern comedy writers deem neces
sary, it is more subtly amusing than
i those plays depending on gags for
j their effects. It would have been
! easy — too easy — to burlesque
the performance, but Director James
Benet exercised fine restraint. The
ending of the play, with coincidence
stretched beyond the bounds of cre
dulity by the reuniting of three
branches of a long-separated family,
was the only exaggerated note in
the performance, but this was the
' fault of Moliere, not the cast. The
attempts by various characters to
outwit the miser kept the audience
thoroughly amused.
The remainder of the cast in
cluded Neal Berry, Walt Newcomb,
Bill Blues, and* Rosemary Benet.
