"Remember that the decision of,
oining a sorority or remaining in the
hall is a strictly personal affair, as is
also whatever sorority you may join.
Neither your friends, campus men,
nor old girls can decide for you."
In an open letter to the freshmen
women, distributed in Rofcle a few

dent of Panhellenic, thus expressad
a view that has been seconded
throughout the campus, and was ex
pressed by The Daily in an editorial
hat appeared on the front page
Tuesday morning.
Prominent wemen on the campus,
when asked for their views on the
oub ect, made the following state
ments:
Charlotte Gibner, vice-president of
Panhellenic and president of Pi Beta
Phi: "The editorial is, in my opin
ion, the best that has ever been
writlen in ;he history of Stanford
ush'ng. It is the on'y fair and un
birsed Judgment expressed by a man
on women's rushing in my expe
rience. It is fair both to the halls and
to the sororities."
Helen Ray, vice-president of the
Associated Students: "In my opinion
women's rushing should be given no
more publicity than men's. Publi
cizing is only emphasizing it."
Barbara Roberts, president of
Kappa Kappa Gamma: "I think the
editor states the problem clearly and
nbiasedly. He gives any girl very
3ood advice."
