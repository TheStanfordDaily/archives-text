## 
### 
The 1934 football season will reach
| a glorious climax on January 1, when
, Stanford meets Alabama in ihe Pasa
dena Rose Bowl, and the eastern
I stars vie in a charity game with
j western lights in Kezar Stadium in
\ San Francisco.
i Far westward, on the same after
noon, the Golden Bears of Califor

Odds Against Troy
Between now and New Year's Day
I there are several gridiron encoun
ters that should attract much notice.
This Saturday the Ramblers of
Notre Dame renew their colorful
feud with the Southern California
' Trojans, who are already on the
short end of 11-5 odds. Trey has
1 won only one conference game this
j year and the South has lost a little
J faith in them.
The South Bend eleven has had a
I fairly successful season defeating
! Purdue, Carnegie Tech, Wisconsin,
I Northwestern, and the Army. The
! Ramblers dropped games to Texas,
I Pittsburgh, and Navy, all by close
scores. Regardless of the odds, the
Los Angeles game should attract a
! good crowd.
Broncos Play in Texas
Western foothall honor will be up
| held by the Santa Clara team, in
Fort Worth, Texas, when they tangle
with Texas Christian this Saturday.
The Texans have a powerful aggre
gation, although they have lost
! games to Centenary and Texas Uni-
I versity. The last game ended in a
20-19 score. The Christians' -most
I impressive win was over Rice, whose
| backfield has been heralded as the
1 best in the country.
The Broncos have but one loss
i to mar their record, the debated
| mud fight with St. Mary's. A com
parative score of the two teams can

] be given as both have played Loyola
of Los Angeles. Santa Clara won
over the Lions 9-0, while the Texas
team came out ahead 7-0, which
! makes Clipper Smith's men two
! points to the better.
Michigan State will wind up a
'season marked by only one loss, to
Syracuse, also in Texas where they
meet the Texas A. & M. eleven.
Louisiana State, recently defeated
by Tulane, tackle Tennessee, who
held Alabama 13-6.
