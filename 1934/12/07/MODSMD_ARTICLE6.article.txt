# THEATER FEE APPEARS SET FOR NEXT QUARTER
## 
### 
That Stanford students will begin
paying a dollar extra on tuition and
community fees next quarter to
start plans for financing the New
Theatre is practically a certainty, ac
cording to A.S.S.U. President Marvic
Kahn.
Though earliest possible construc
tion on the New Theatre will not
bo until June, according to present
plans, Ex Committee petitioned
President Ray Lyman Wilbur to add
the tuition on winter quarter' in
order to make adequate financing
for the structure possible.
Dr. Wilbur has approved the
petition, but the Board of Trustees
has not yet announced its sanc
tion. It is rumored, however, that
the winter quarter registration
booklets with community fees
placed at $15 have already been

[ printed.
A.S.S.U. work on the New The
atre project will continue unabated
for the rest of the quarter, even
though Ex Committee will not hold
another meeting until next quarter,
according to Kahn.
In its last meeting Ex Committee
| authorized Kahn and Ben Cave,
l student manager, to transact all
business for the A.S.S.U., "unless
there is a protest."
In this connection Kahn said, "I
! will only conduct business of a minor
nature." When asked if he would
! transact business in regard to the
Daily, he said, "No."
Cave had no statement to make.
First business carried on by the
Kahn-Cave system was the granting
of Circle numerals to the freshman
1 soccer team, a proceeding overlooked
i by Ex Committee Tuesday night.
