NEW REGIME'S SECOND
SEASON CLOSES

By the lime this Daily publishes its next issue, Claude E. Thornhill !
will have celebrated the completion of his second year as head coach of
the Stanford Indian football team.
The record of Tiny Thornhill and his two assistants, Ernie Nevers and
Jim Lawson, in the two short seasons they have been in charge of local
gridiron destinies is by far the best of any similar period in Stanford
athletic history.
Acknowledged the best on the Pacific Coast last year, and consid
ered one of the three best teams in the country as the second schedule
is closed, in spite of comment to the contrary by El Kunyan, the
Indians have made the new regime's start a completely satisfying
success.
Thornhill deserves and gets a lot of commendation. There is none of J
the alumni howling, no faculty or student dissatisfaction, and the athletic
situation in many ways is better than ever.
Stanford has a winning football team! That may be the entire
reason. But the fact remains that there is better student spirit and

sportsmanship, a better mental attitude among the Cardinal athletes,
and a better feeling oward Stanford from the outside than there has
ever before been.
But Tiny and staff did not entirely start from scratch. When they took
over the reigns there was none of this "Four years to come through or
else," stuff. Instead, everyone was behind the new experiment—that of
promoting local talent to the head-coaching duties.

TINY INAUGURATED
MANY NEW POLICIES

Tiny, always the pupil of Glenn S. Warner, the "Old Fox," continued
with many of Warner's plans when he took over the reigns here, but
he inaugurated many new policies. So Stanford still uses a Warner system,
but it is modified in many respects.
Defying Pop's old principle, Thornhill was quick to notice the
powerful combination of 1932 freshmen and to make use of them on
the varsity. Warner's idea of sophomores was something to hold over
on the Gray team for training, and then to break them into their first
varsity experience as juniors.
Consequently, it was primarily a sophomore team that finished last
year's schedule against California and went on to Rose Bowl combat with
Columbia. It started in the first game when Thornhill tried the noble
experiment of opening the San Jose contest with Monk Moscrip and
Bobby Grayson, untried sophs, in the line-up.
This worked out quite well, and soon Bob Reynolds, Claude Calla
way, Bones Hamilton, Frankie Alustiza, and Earl Hons were added.
They played regularly during mid-season, and were joined toward the
end of the year by Wcs Muller, who had ployed on the Grays the year
before, and Keith Topping, a made-over basketball player.
During this time Woody Adams, Larry Rouble, Shelly Bronstein, Alex
Trompas, and Johnny Reisner were all gaining much part-time experience.
This was but. one of the new regime's many innovations in coaching.

Another was the '--pint of friendship between
coaches, players, and students. It has become
tradition among grid mentors to bellow out
orders and crack whips at the free, white, and
often 21, football contestants. None of that with
Thornhill. He makes his wishes known, all right,
with the squad, but dees it in a less antagonizing
manner.
Helping this along considerably, of course,
is the unusually , mature attitude of the
present crop of athletes. Those sophomores,
who had visions of greatness way back in
their freshman year, knew exactly what they
were after. They lacked experience in their
first varsity year, but just a suggestion from
the coaches usually was sufficient.

This sea.son that attitude was particularly noticeable. They could have
been a reasonably sood team without anv coachine staff.

PLAYERS JUST
STUDENTS, AFTER ALL

Along with this new .spirit inaugurated when Tiny, Ernie, and Jim
took over the reigns, was the attitude of players that they were just
students at Stanford, and not the elite of the cam- r

pus. I knew a student at the University of
California who came back to the home town
and bragged, "I once said hello to ro-and-so,
he plays .second string on the football team."
None of that stuff here.
The first part of every practice session
has been more like a tea party; the team
members all kid Tiny, and he comes right
hack with a "wise one" of his own. Oh yes,
it's all quite wholesome.
Certain other people are largely responsible
for Stanford's huge success on the gridiron these
past two years besides the coaching staff.
There is Grayson, who has done much of

the scoring and ground-gaining, and there i.s Moscrip, who has given j
many a spectacular demonstration at end.
But at least as great a contribution to the Stanford team has been
the less conspicuous work of Alustiza, and Hamilton, and Reynolds,
and Callaway, and the others who have played regularly for two
seasons. ■ ■
Alustiza's kicking has saved Stanford many times, and it was his I
that won (he 1933 Big Game.

BEST MAN ON THE
TEAM—BONES HAMILTON

Our official nomination at this time for the rating of most valuable j
player during the past two seasons goes to Bones Hamilton, however, j
JI was "Captain Bones" who held the squad together mentally and made j
the long run to this year's Big Game touchdown. It was also Captain
Bones who has done fully half of the blocking and interfering in the |
Stanford backfield this year.
Next place on our list of valuables is taken by "Horse" Reynolds, j
so called since freshman days when playful playmates locked a horse in |
his upper-.story room for a full week-end. Reynolds is another of those !
inconspicuous players who does the same to the line that Hamilton i
to the backfield. He is a cool, heady player that is hard to ruffle, bui '
he charges hard, and has the weight to make quite an impression on
opposition.
Accept our congratulations, Stanford coaches and team, for an excep
tional start on a new Cardinal football regime. —-BrovCme.

with many of Warner's plans when he took over the reigns here, but
he inaugurated many new policies. So Stanford still uses a Warner system,
but it is modified in many respects.
Defying Pop's old principle, Thornhill was quick to notice the
powerful combination of 1932 freshmen and to make use of them on
the varsity. Warner's idea of sophomores was something to hold over
on the Gray team for training, and then to break them into their first
varsity experience as juniors.
Consequently, it was primarily a sophomore team that finished last
year's schedule against California and went on to Rose Bowl combat with
Columbia. It started in the first game when Thornhill tried the noble
experiment of opening the San Jose contest with Monk Moscrip and
Bobby Grayson, untried sophs, in the line-up.
This worked out quite well, and soon Bob Reynolds, Claude Calla
way, Bones Hamilton, Frankie Alustiza, and Earl Hons were added.
They played regularly during mid-season, and were joined toward the
end of the year by Wcs Muller, who had ployed on the Grays the year
before, and Keith Topping, a made-over basketball player.
During this time Woody Adams, Larry Rouble, Shelly Bronstein, Alex
Trompas, and Johnny Reisner were all gaining much part-time experience.
This was but. one of the new regime's many innovations in coaching.

Another was the '--pint of friendship between
coaches, players, and students. It has become
tradition among grid mentors to bellow out
orders and crack whips at the free, white, and
often 21, football contestants. None of that with
Thornhill. He makes his wishes known, all right,
with the squad, but dees it in a less antagonizing
manner.
Helping this along considerably, of course,
is the unusually , mature attitude of the
present crop of athletes. Those sophomores,
who had visions of greatness way back in
their freshman year, knew exactly what they
were after. They lacked experience in their
first varsity year, but just a suggestion from
the coaches usually was sufficient.

This sea.son that attitude was particularly noticeable. They could have
been a reasonably sood team without anv coachine staff.

PLAYERS JUST
STUDENTS, AFTER ALL

Along with this new .spirit inaugurated when Tiny, Ernie, and Jim
took over the reigns, was the attitude of players that they were just
students at Stanford, and not the elite of the cam- r

pus. I knew a student at the University of
California who came back to the home town
and bragged, "I once said hello to ro-and-so,
he plays .second string on the football team."
None of that stuff here.
The first part of every practice session
has been more like a tea party; the team
members all kid Tiny, and he comes right
hack with a "wise one" of his own. Oh yes,
it's all quite wholesome.
Certain other people are largely responsible
for Stanford's huge success on the gridiron these
past two years besides the coaching staff.
There is Grayson, who has done much of

the scoring and ground-gaining, and there i.s Moscrip, who has given j
many a spectacular demonstration at end.
But at least as great a contribution to the Stanford team has been
the less conspicuous work of Alustiza, and Hamilton, and Reynolds,
and Callaway, and the others who have played regularly for two
seasons. ■ ■
Alustiza's kicking has saved Stanford many times, and it was his I
that won (he 1933 Big Game.

BEST MAN ON THE
TEAM—BONES HAMILTON

Our official nomination at this time for the rating of most valuable j
player during the past two seasons goes to Bones Hamilton, however, j
JI was "Captain Bones" who held the squad together mentally and made j
the long run to this year's Big Game touchdown. It was also Captain
Bones who has done fully half of the blocking and interfering in the |
Stanford backfield this year.
Next place on our list of valuables is taken by "Horse" Reynolds, j
so called since freshman days when playful playmates locked a horse in |
his upper-.story room for a full week-end. Reynolds is another of those !
inconspicuous players who does the same to the line that Hamilton i

opposition.

NEW REGIME'S SECOND
SEASON CLOSES

By the lime this Daily publishes its next issue, Claude E. Thornhill !

the Stanford Indian football team.
The record of Tiny Thornhill and his two assistants, Ernie Nevers and
Jim Lawson, in the two short seasons they have been in charge of local
gridiron destinies is by far the best of any similar period in Stanford
athletic history.
Acknowledged the best on the Pacific Coast last year, and consid
ered one of the three best teams in the country as the second schedule
is closed, in spite of comment to the contrary by El Kunyan, the
Indians have made the new regime's start a completely satisfying

Thornhill deserves and gets a lot of commendation. There is none of J

Stanford has a winning football team! That may be the entire
reason. But the fact remains that there is better student spirit and

sportsmanship, a better mental attitude among the Cardinal athletes,
and a better feeling oward Stanford from the outside than there has
ever before been.
But Tiny and staff did not entirely start from scratch. When they took

PLAYERS JUST
STUDENTS, AFTER ALL

Along with this new .spirit inaugurated when Tiny, Ernie, and Jim
took over the reigns, was the attitude of players that they were just
students at Stanford, and not the elite of the cam- r

pus. I knew a student at the University of
California who came back to the home town
and bragged, "I once said hello to ro-and-so,
he plays .second string on the football team."
None of that stuff here.
The first part of every practice session
has been more like a tea party; the team
members all kid Tiny, and he comes right
hack with a "wise one" of his own. Oh yes,
it's all quite wholesome.
Certain other people are largely responsible
for Stanford's huge success on the gridiron these
past two years besides the coaching staff.
There is Grayson, who has done much of

the scoring and ground-gaining, and there i.s Moscrip, who has given j
many a spectacular demonstration at end.
But at least as great a contribution to the Stanford team has been
the less conspicuous work of Alustiza, and Hamilton, and Reynolds,
and Callaway, and the others who have played regularly for two
seasons. ■ ■
Alustiza's kicking has saved Stanford many times, and it was his I
that won (he 1933 Big Game.

BEST MAN ON THE
TEAM—BONES HAMILTON

Our official nomination at this time for the rating of most valuable j
player during the past two seasons goes to Bones Hamilton, however, j
JI was "Captain Bones" who held the squad together mentally and made j
the long run to this year's Big Game touchdown. It was also Captain
Bones who has done fully half of the blocking and interfering in the |
Stanford backfield this year.
Next place on our list of valuables is taken by "Horse" Reynolds, j
so called since freshman days when playful playmates locked a horse in |
his upper-.story room for a full week-end. Reynolds is another of those !
inconspicuous players who does the same to the line that Hamilton i
to the backfield. He is a cool, heady player that is hard to ruffle, bui '
he charges hard, and has the weight to make quite an impression on
opposition.
Accept our congratulations, Stanford coaches and team, for an excep
tional start on a new Cardinal football regime. —-BrovCme.

NEW REGIME'S SECOND
SEASON CLOSES

By the lime this Daily publishes its next issue, Claude E. Thornhill !
will have celebrated the completion of his second year as head coach of
the Stanford Indian football team.
The record of Tiny Thornhill and his two assistants, Ernie Nevers and
Jim Lawson, in the two short seasons they have been in charge of local
gridiron destinies is by far the best of any similar period in Stanford
athletic history.
Acknowledged the best on the Pacific Coast last year, and consid
ered one of the three best teams in the country as the second schedule
is closed, in spite of comment to the contrary by El Kunyan, the
Indians have made the new regime's start a completely satisfying
success.
Thornhill deserves and gets a lot of commendation. There is none of J
the alumni howling, no faculty or student dissatisfaction, and the athletic
situation in many ways is better than ever.
Stanford has a winning football team! That may be the entire
reason. But the fact remains that there is better student spirit and

sportsmanship, a better mental attitude among the Cardinal athletes,
and a better feeling oward Stanford from the outside than there has
ever before been.
But Tiny and staff did not entirely start from scratch. When they took
over the reigns there was none of this "Four years to come through or
else," stuff. Instead, everyone was behind the new experiment—that of
promoting local talent to the head-coaching duties.

TINY INAUGURATED
MANY NEW POLICIES

Tiny, always the pupil of Glenn S. Warner, the "Old Fox," continued
with many of Warner's plans when he took over the reigns here, but
he inaugurated many new policies. So Stanford still uses a Warner system,
but it is modified in many respects.
Defying Pop's old principle, Thornhill was quick to notice the
powerful combination of 1932 freshmen and to make use of them on
the varsity. Warner's idea of sophomores was something to hold over
on the Gray team for training, and then to break them into their first
varsity experience as juniors.
Consequently, it was primarily a sophomore team that finished last
year's schedule against California and went on to Rose Bowl combat with
Columbia. It started in the first game when Thornhill tried the noble
experiment of opening the San Jose contest with Monk Moscrip and
Bobby Grayson, untried sophs, in the line-up.
This worked out quite well, and soon Bob Reynolds, Claude Calla
way, Bones Hamilton, Frankie Alustiza, and Earl Hons were added.
They played regularly during mid-season, and were joined toward the
end of the year by Wcs Muller, who had ployed on the Grays the year
before, and Keith Topping, a made-over basketball player.
During this time Woody Adams, Larry Rouble, Shelly Bronstein, Alex
Trompas, and Johnny Reisner were all gaining much part-time experience.
This was but. one of the new regime's many innovations in coaching.

Another was the '--pint of friendship between
coaches, players, and students. It has become
tradition among grid mentors to bellow out
orders and crack whips at the free, white, and
often 21, football contestants. None of that with
Thornhill. He makes his wishes known, all right,
with the squad, but dees it in a less antagonizing
manner.
