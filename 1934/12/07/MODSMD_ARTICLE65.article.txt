# RUGGERS, HOPEFUL OF CANADIAN TRIP, TO CONTINUE DRILL
## Five Players To Be Chosen From Stanford 
### Warren Breed 
With live of their number to be !
picked on the All-Star team going
to British* Columbia in two weeks, i
varsity ruggers held spirited scrim- j
{ mage yesterday under the twin- I
j kling eye of Coach Jim Wylie.'
Coaches Wylie and Harry Maloney j
plan to work out the squad regularly
j for the next fortnight, finals or no
finals. The other three conference
j schools, U.C., U.S.C., and U.C.L.A., j
| who will send the other fifteen north,
j are also keeping up on practice
I sessions.
Canadians Strong
Canadian strength will warrant all
preparation indulged in, if it is to j
i be judged by its three wins in the
series last winter.
The California Conference team
plans to leave for the North De- j
cember 22; the return date is not j
now known. Headquarters will
i probably be Vancouver, last year's
i base.
At the present there is no indica
j tion as to the five who will be chose/"
| from the sizeable Card squad. Con
i siderable new material showed up
j well in the scrimmage yesterday, and
veterans may be replaced.
Palamountain Stars
Ben Palamountain, playing in the j
three-quarters line, was a standout
j threat for his team. He tore off one I
run of 95 yards, only to be leaped
upon from behind by a couple of
the opposition. If he occupies a back
position he will do plenty of dam- j
i age, claiming more than the average
j size and speed.
Ray Lewis also looked good carry
i ing the ball, frequently scooping it
lup for several lengthy runs. Cap
tain Roger Hager, always a depend-
I able man in the scrum, was out
i standing, as were Ed Becker, Primo
i Pinotti, and several others.
