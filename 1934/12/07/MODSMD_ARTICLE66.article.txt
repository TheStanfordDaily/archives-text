# SEQUOIA I DEFEATS SIGMA CHI, 6 TO 0
## 
### 
The University championship in !
1 touch-football went to Sequoia 1 ;
i yesterday afternoon at the Grays' j
I field when Bill Ladue ran 20 yards I
â€¢ to a touchdown for the only score
of the game against Sigma Chi.
The score came late in the first
I half. Ladue failed to drop kick the j
I conversion, the ball sailing wide,
1 and the final score was 0 to 0 after j
| a torrid second half.
Fading back for what was appar
i ently a pass, Ladue reversed his field, 1
while Sigma Chi backs covered pass
! receivers, and dashed down the right
sideline to score.
Later in the game Sigma Chi
j blocked a Sequoia punt and recov- j
j ered on the Sequoia 40-yard stripe,'
but they could not penetrate the
stiff Sequoia defense.
i The game was filled with activity,
j both teams charging up field re
peatedly with concentrated drives. '
