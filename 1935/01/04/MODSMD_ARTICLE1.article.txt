# TIDE AIR SHOW BETTERS CARD ATTACK 29 TO 13
## 85,000 Watch Howell Pass Alabama To Win In All-American Game GRAYSON LEADS CARDS Bama Scores 22 Points In Second Quarter

Alabama's passing—
Stanford's power—
Each team's defensive prowess,
which proved so ineffective against
the other's scoring specialty—
There's your real all-American
team. Alternate each team for a
quarter and you'll have something.
That was exactly what some 85,000
fans saw Tuesday afternoon in the
smoothest, cleanest, and all-around
best Rose Bowl gridiron classic ot
them all in Pasadena.
Those 85,000 all jammed Southern
California highways late on that
New Year's afternoon feeling they
had just watched the most spectacu
lar air show in football today whip
the game's greatest power attack,
29 to 13, in a totally satisfying game
of "sport as it should be played."
Stanford has three all-Ameri
cans. So has Alabama. AH six
looked the part in opposing each
other.
The Crimson Tide's passing pa
rade, which set up three touch
downs and a field goal, was the
margin of victory. That margin
was undisputcdly there, although
some say it was not by 1(5 points
as the scoreboard showed.
It was a case of too much Dixie
Howell. Secondarily it was a case
of too much Don Hutson and Riley

ford defense against passing.
The Daily is a bit late wiih super
latives concerning this Mr. Howell,
and the* best thing we can do is
leave them implied. He was with
out much question the outstanding
player on the field which saw the
biggest all-star parade in 1934 in
tercollegiate football.
Stanford started the scoring pa
rade, and the first quarter ended
much as did those when the In
dians met U.C.L.A., Washington,
and Ihe other regular coast teams.
But it was the second period
that Stanford fans are dreaming
about after too much mince pic.
Howell started passing. He quit
passing al half tinjc for a few
moments with the count 22 to 7
in favor of the Tide.
Stanford began to show her face
above water in the third period
again. The halftime kickoff was
taken back some 75 yards on the
typical straight power to a (ouch
down. and the remainder of the
period remained without threats.
Just when the Indians were on
