# TIDE AIR SHOW BETTERS CARD ATTACK 29 TO 13
## 85,000 Watch Howell Pass Alabama To Win In All-American Game GRAYSON LEADS CARDS Bama Scores 22 Points In Second Quarter 
### Millard Browne 
Alabama's passing—
Stanford's power—
Each team's defensive prowess,
which proved so ineffective against
the other's scoring specialty—
There's your real all-American
team. Alternate each team for a
quarter and you'll have something.
That was exactly what some 85,000
fans saw Tuesday afternoon in the
smoothest, cleanest, and all-around
best Rose Bowl gridiron classic ot
them all in Pasadena.
Those 85,000 all jammed Southern
California highways late on that
New Year's afternoon feeling they
had just watched the most spectacu
lar air show in football today whip
the game's greatest power attack,
29 to 13, in a totally satisfying game
of "sport as it should be played."
Stanford has three all-Ameri
cans. So has Alabama. AH six
looked the part in opposing each
other.
The Crimson Tide's passing pa
rade, which set up three touch
downs and a field goal, was the
margin of victory. That margin
was undisputcdly there, although
some say it was not by 1(5 points
as the scoreboard showed.
It was a case of too much Dixie
Howell. Secondarily it was a case
of too much Don Hutson and Riley

Smith, and not quite enough Stan
ford defense against passing.
The Daily is a bit late wiih super
latives concerning this Mr. Howell,
and the* best thing we can do is
leave them implied. He was with
out much question the outstanding
player on the field which saw the
biggest all-star parade in 1934 in
tercollegiate football.
Stanford started the scoring pa
rade, and the first quarter ended
much as did those when the In
dians met U.C.L.A., Washington,
and Ihe other regular coast teams.
But it was the second period
that Stanford fans are dreaming
about after too much mince pic.
Howell started passing. He quit
passing al half tinjc for a few
moments with the count 22 to 7
in favor of the Tide.
Stanford began to show her face
above water in the third period
again. The halftime kickoff was
taken back some 75 yards on the
typical straight power to a (ouch
down. and the remainder of the
period remained without threats.
Just when the Indians were on
I the way toward overcoming a dis
gusting 15-point lead, the southern
ers took to the air again. This time
it was the 59-yard Howell-Hutson
! touchdown pass, which snapped off
| Stanford's last lingering chance at
victory, and the rest of the game
was spent in vain Cardinal thrusts
which almost, but not quite, scored
twice.
Cards Score Early
Late in the first period, the In
dians recovered Demyanovich's
fumble on the 27-yard stripe and
sliced through to the one-yard line
j on four successive plays. Bobby
; Grayson barely bucked over on his
j first chance, and Monk Moscrip
! added the point.
Bama started her first drive on
! the Cardinal 45. Howell passed to
I Hutson for 18; Howell to Angelich
for 11 more; Bryant on an end
I around gained the 21-yard line;
Howell to Hutson for 16 more to
the 5, and Howell, with a pass threat,
knifed through guard for the touch
down. Smith failed to convert, and
the South was behind, 6 to 7.
The Tide received the next kick
| off, and gained 20 yards on two run
ning plays; then Howell passed to
Hutson-twice to put the ball on the
Stanford 33, from where Howell
gained three on a running play. The
Dixie all-American made his first
incompleted pass at this point, but
countered with an 18-yard shot to
Bryant. Three more plays v/ere good
for but six yards, and Smith kicked
a field goal—9 to 7..
Howell Runs (57 Yards
Stanford again kicked, and Howell
I returned the ball to the 26; Angelich
j added seven, and Howell went over
left end for 67 yards to the: second
Bama touchdown. Smith kicked the
| goal to make it 16 to 7, with less than
j two minutes remaining in the half.
Stanford received, but Smith in
tercepted Stan Anderson's pass on
the Alabama 46. With Howell out
J of the game, Smith passed to Hutson
for 54 yards and another touchdown
j to give the Tide 22 points lor the
quarter's work.
Stanford Marches 75 Yards
i It was now Stanford's turn. After
taking a fumble on the 25, the In
dians made 75 yards to a touchdown
in ten plays. Grayson gained five,
Captain Bones Hamilton added four
and then 14, Grayson made 3, Buck
Van Dellen picked tip four. Grayson
gained 19, Van Dellen added another
seven, Hamilton made two, Grayson
added one, all of which put the ball
on the 12-yard line, and Van Dellen
went over standing up. Moscrip
failed to convert.
The remainder of the quarter was
spent in futile Indian thrusts, and
the Tide had the ball on the Stanford
46 as (ho fourth period opened. The
Tide passed incomplete and was
then penalized 15 yards, from where
Howell shot a pass to Hutson that
gained 59 yards for another touch
down to make the count 29 to 13,
where the score stood until the
finish.
Indian Ends Look Good
The Stanford ends looked particu
larly good during the game—Keith
Topping and Moscrip tackling vic
iously and protecting their positions
well. Moscrip was largely respon
sible for the loss of 45 yards suf
fercd by Alabama during the game.
He was sucked in on one occasion

when Howell scored his 67 - yard
touchdown, but that was his one
mistake.
Hamilton was his old blocking and
tackling self, although he appeared
bewildered by the aerial show; he
was helpless in trying to copc with
Howell's bullet passes, but was ready
for the tackle on all of tho tosses
that came into his territory.
Grayson Is Outstanding
Grayson was easily the standout
among Cardinal backfield men, al
though Van Dellen played his best
game of the season. Bob Reynolds
was consistent at tackle, and the en
tire line functioned well, particularly
when on offense.
Howell's speed and passing spoke
for themselves among the Bama
players, as did Hutson's sprinting
and aerial receiving.
The phenomenal blocking of
Smith, giant quarterback, was the
chief thing that permitted Howell
enough time to make his passes
click.
Bill Lee, Tide captain and all-
American tackle, withstood a ter
rific Stanford tackle-pounding well
and added much to his team's prow
ess. Kay Francis was another stand
out in the Alabama line.

Hutson-twice to put the ball on the
Stanford 33, from where Howell
gained three on a running play. The
Dixie all-American made his first
incompleted pass at this point, but
countered with an 18-yard shot to
Bryant. Three more plays v/ere good
for but six yards, and Smith kicked
a field goal—9 to 7..
Howell Runs (57 Yards
Stanford again kicked, and Howell
I returned the ball to the 26; Angelich
j added seven, and Howell went over
left end for 67 yards to the: second
Bama touchdown. Smith kicked the
| goal to make it 16 to 7, with less than
j two minutes remaining in the half.
Stanford received, but Smith in
tercepted Stan Anderson's pass on
the Alabama 46. With Howell out
J of the game, Smith passed to Hutson
for 54 yards and another touchdown
j to give the Tide 22 points lor the
quarter's work.
Stanford Marches 75 Yards
i It was now Stanford's turn. After
taking a fumble on the 25, the In
dians made 75 yards to a touchdown
in ten plays. Grayson gained five,
Captain Bones Hamilton added four
and then 14, Grayson made 3, Buck
Van Dellen picked tip four. Grayson
gained 19, Van Dellen added another
seven, Hamilton made two, Grayson
added one, all of which put the ball
on the 12-yard line, and Van Dellen
went over standing up. Moscrip
failed to convert.
The remainder of the quarter was
spent in futile Indian thrusts, and
the Tide had the ball on the Stanford
46 as (ho fourth period opened. The
Tide passed incomplete and was
then penalized 15 yards, from where
Howell shot a pass to Hutson that
gained 59 yards for another touch
down to make the count 29 to 13,
where the score stood until the
finish.
Indian Ends Look Good
The Stanford ends looked particu
larly good during the game—Keith
Topping and Moscrip tackling vic
iously and protecting their positions
well. Moscrip was largely respon
sible for the loss of 45 yards suf
fercd by Alabama during the game.
He was sucked in on one occasion

when Howell scored his 67 - yard
touchdown, but that was his one
mistake.
Hamilton was his old blocking and
tackling self, although he appeared
bewildered by the aerial show; he
was helpless in trying to copc with
Howell's bullet passes, but was ready
for the tackle on all of tho tosses
that came into his territory.
Grayson Is Outstanding
Grayson was easily the standout
among Cardinal backfield men, al
though Van Dellen played his best
game of the season. Bob Reynolds
was consistent at tackle, and the en
tire line functioned well, particularly
when on offense.
Howell's speed and passing spoke
for themselves among the Bama
players, as did Hutson's sprinting
and aerial receiving.
The phenomenal blocking of
Smith, giant quarterback, was the
chief thing that permitted Howell
enough time to make his passes
click.
Bill Lee, Tide captain and all-
American tackle, withstood a ter
rific Stanford tackle-pounding well
and added much to his team's prow
ess. Kay Francis was another stand
out in the Alabama line.
Alabama's passing—
Stanford's power—
Each team's defensive prowess,
which proved so ineffective against
the other's scoring specialty—
There's your real all-American
team. Alternate each team for a
quarter and you'll have something.
That was exactly what some 85,000
fans saw Tuesday afternoon in the
smoothest, cleanest, and all-around
best Rose Bowl gridiron classic ot
them all in Pasadena.
Those 85,000 all jammed Southern
California highways late on that
New Year's afternoon feeling they
had just watched the most spectacu
lar air show in football today whip
the game's greatest power attack,
29 to 13, in a totally satisfying game
of "sport as it should be played."
Stanford has three all-Ameri
cans. So has Alabama. AH six
looked the part in opposing each
other.
The Crimson Tide's passing pa
rade, which set up three touch
downs and a field goal, was the
margin of victory. That margin
was undisputcdly there, although
some say it was not by 1(5 points
as the scoreboard showed.
It was a case of too much Dixie
Howell. Secondarily it was a case
of too much Don Hutson and Riley

Smith, and not quite enough Stan
ford defense against passing.
The Daily is a bit late wiih super
latives concerning this Mr. Howell,
and the* best thing we can do is
leave them implied. He was with
out much question the outstanding
player on the field which saw the
biggest all-star parade in 1934 in
tercollegiate football.

much as did those when the In

But it was the second period
that Stanford fans are dreaming
about after too much mince pic.
Howell started passing. He quit
passing al half tinjc for a few
moments with the count 22 to 7
in favor of the Tide.
Stanford began to show her face
above water in the third period
again. The halftime kickoff was
taken back some 75 yards on the
typical straight power to a (ouch
down. and the remainder of the
period remained without threats.
Just when the Indians were on
I the way toward overcoming a dis
gusting 15-point lead, the southern
ers took to the air again. This time
it was the 59-yard Howell-Hutson
! touchdown pass, which snapped off
| Stanford's last lingering chance at
victory, and the rest of the game
was spent in vain Cardinal thrusts
which almost, but not quite, scored
twice.

them all in Pasadena.
Those 85,000 all jammed Southern
California highways late on that
New Year's afternoon feeling they
had just watched the most spectacu
lar air show in football today whip
the game's greatest power attack,
29 to 13, in a totally satisfying game
of "sport as it should be played."
Stanford has three all-Ameri
cans. So has Alabama. AH six
looked the part in opposing each
other.
The Crimson Tide's passing pa
rade, which set up three touch
downs and a field goal, was the
margin of victory. That margin
was undisputcdly there, although
some say it was not by 1(5 points
as the scoreboard showed.
It was a case of too much Dixie
Howell. Secondarily it was a case
of too much Don Hutson and Riley

Smith, and not quite enough Stan
ford defense against passing.
The Daily is a bit late wiih super
latives concerning this Mr. Howell,
and the* best thing we can do is
leave them implied. He was with
out much question the outstanding
player on the field which saw the
biggest all-star parade in 1934 in
tercollegiate football.
Stanford started the scoring pa
rade, and the first quarter ended
much as did those when the In
dians met U.C.L.A., Washington,
and Ihe other regular coast teams.
But it was the second period
that Stanford fans are dreaming
about after too much mince pic.
Howell started passing. He quit
passing al half tinjc for a few
moments with the count 22 to 7
in favor of the Tide.
Stanford began to show her face
above water in the third period
again. The halftime kickoff was
taken back some 75 yards on the
typical straight power to a (ouch
down. and the remainder of the
period remained without threats.
Just when the Indians were on
I the way toward overcoming a dis
gusting 15-point lead, the southern
ers took to the air again. This time
it was the 59-yard Howell-Hutson
! touchdown pass, which snapped off
| Stanford's last lingering chance at
victory, and the rest of the game
was spent in vain Cardinal thrusts
which almost, but not quite, scored
twice.
Cards Score Early
Late in the first period, the In
dians recovered Demyanovich's
fumble on the 27-yard stripe and
sliced through to the one-yard line
j on four successive plays. Bobby
; Grayson barely bucked over on his
j first chance, and Monk Moscrip
! added the point.
Bama started her first drive on
! the Cardinal 45. Howell passed to
I Hutson for 18; Howell to Angelich
for 11 more; Bryant on an end
I around gained the 21-yard line;
Howell to Hutson for 16 more to
the 5, and Howell, with a pass threat,
knifed through guard for the touch
down. Smith failed to convert, and
the South was behind, 6 to 7.
The Tide received the next kick
| off, and gained 20 yards on two run
ning plays; then Howell passed to
Hutson-twice to put the ball on the
Stanford 33, from where Howell
gained three on a running play. The
Dixie all-American made his first
incompleted pass at this point, but
countered with an 18-yard shot to
Bryant. Three more plays v/ere good
for but six yards, and Smith kicked
a field goal—9 to 7..
Howell Runs (57 Yards
Stanford again kicked, and Howell
I returned the ball to the 26; Angelich
j added seven, and Howell went over
left end for 67 yards to the: second
Bama touchdown. Smith kicked the
| goal to make it 16 to 7, with less than
j two minutes remaining in the half.
Stanford received, but Smith in
tercepted Stan Anderson's pass on
the Alabama 46. With Howell out
J of the game, Smith passed to Hutson
for 54 yards and another touchdown
j to give the Tide 22 points lor the
quarter's work.
Stanford Marches 75 Yards
i It was now Stanford's turn. After
taking a fumble on the 25, the In
dians made 75 yards to a touchdown
in ten plays. Grayson gained five,
Captain Bones Hamilton added four
and then 14, Grayson made 3, Buck
Van Dellen picked tip four. Grayson
gained 19, Van Dellen added another
seven, Hamilton made two, Grayson
added one, all of which put the ball
on the 12-yard line, and Van Dellen
went over standing up. Moscrip
failed to convert.
The remainder of the quarter was
spent in futile Indian thrusts, and
the Tide had the ball on the Stanford
46 as (ho fourth period opened. The
Tide passed incomplete and was
then penalized 15 yards, from where
Howell shot a pass to Hutson that
gained 59 yards for another touch
down to make the count 29 to 13,
where the score stood until the
finish.
Indian Ends Look Good
The Stanford ends looked particu
larly good during the game—Keith
Topping and Moscrip tackling vic
iously and protecting their positions
well. Moscrip was largely respon
sible for the loss of 45 yards suf
fercd by Alabama during the game.
He was sucked in on one occasion

when Howell scored his 67 - yard
touchdown, but that was his one
mistake.
Hamilton was his old blocking and
tackling self, although he appeared
bewildered by the aerial show; he
was helpless in trying to copc with
Howell's bullet passes, but was ready
for the tackle on all of tho tosses
that came into his territory.
Grayson Is Outstanding
Grayson was easily the standout
among Cardinal backfield men, al
though Van Dellen played his best
game of the season. Bob Reynolds
was consistent at tackle, and the en
tire line functioned well, particularly
when on offense.
Howell's speed and passing spoke
for themselves among the Bama
players, as did Hutson's sprinting
and aerial receiving.
The phenomenal blocking of
Smith, giant quarterback, was the
chief thing that permitted Howell
enough time to make his passes
click.
Bill Lee, Tide captain and all-
American tackle, withstood a ter
rific Stanford tackle-pounding well
and added much to his team's prow
ess. Kay Francis was another stand
out in the Alabama line.
Alabama's passing—
Stanford's power—
Each team's defensive prowess,
which proved so ineffective against
the other's scoring specialty—
There's your real all-American
team. Alternate each team for a
quarter and you'll have something.

| goal to make it 16 to 7, with less than
j two minutes remaining in the half.
Stanford received, but Smith in
tercepted Stan Anderson's pass on
the Alabama 46. With Howell out
J of the game, Smith passed to Hutson
for 54 yards and another touchdown
j to give the Tide 22 points lor the
quarter's work.
Stanford Marches 75 Yards
i It was now Stanford's turn. After
taking a fumble on the 25, the In
dians made 75 yards to a touchdown
in ten plays. Grayson gained five,
Captain Bones Hamilton added four
and then 14, Grayson made 3, Buck
Van Dellen picked tip four. Grayson
gained 19, Van Dellen added another
seven, Hamilton made two, Grayson
added one, all of which put the ball
on the 12-yard line, and Van Dellen
went over standing up. Moscrip
failed to convert.
The remainder of the quarter was
spent in futile Indian thrusts, and
the Tide had the ball on the Stanford
46 as (ho fourth period opened. The
Tide passed incomplete and was
then penalized 15 yards, from where
Howell shot a pass to Hutson that
gained 59 yards for another touch
down to make the count 29 to 13,
where the score stood until the
finish.
Indian Ends Look Good
The Stanford ends looked particu
larly good during the game—Keith
Topping and Moscrip tackling vic
iously and protecting their positions
well. Moscrip was largely respon
sible for the loss of 45 yards suf
fercd by Alabama during the game.
He was sucked in on one occasion

when Howell scored his 67 - yard
touchdown, but that was his one
mistake.
Hamilton was his old blocking and
tackling self, although he appeared
bewildered by the aerial show; he
was helpless in trying to copc with
Howell's bullet passes, but was ready
for the tackle on all of tho tosses
that came into his territory.
Grayson Is Outstanding
Grayson was easily the standout
among Cardinal backfield men, al
though Van Dellen played his best
game of the season. Bob Reynolds
was consistent at tackle, and the en
tire line functioned well, particularly
when on offense.
Howell's speed and passing spoke
for themselves among the Bama
players, as did Hutson's sprinting
and aerial receiving.
The phenomenal blocking of
Smith, giant quarterback, was the
chief thing that permitted Howell
enough time to make his passes
click.
Bill Lee, Tide captain and all-
American tackle, withstood a ter
rific Stanford tackle-pounding well
and added much to his team's prow
ess. Kay Francis was another stand
out in the Alabama line.
Alabama's passing—
Stanford's power—
Each team's defensive prowess,
which proved so ineffective against
the other's scoring specialty—
There's your real all-American
team. Alternate each team for a
quarter and you'll have something.
That was exactly what some 85,000
fans saw Tuesday afternoon in the
smoothest, cleanest, and all-around
best Rose Bowl gridiron classic ot
them all in Pasadena.
Those 85,000 all jammed Southern
California highways late on that
New Year's afternoon feeling they
had just watched the most spectacu
lar air show in football today whip
the game's greatest power attack,
29 to 13, in a totally satisfying game
of "sport as it should be played."
Stanford has three all-Ameri
cans. So has Alabama. AH six
looked the part in opposing each
other.
The Crimson Tide's passing pa
rade, which set up three touch
downs and a field goal, was the
margin of victory. That margin
was undisputcdly there, although
some say it was not by 1(5 points
as the scoreboard showed.
It was a case of too much Dixie
Howell. Secondarily it was a case
of too much Don Hutson and Riley

Smith, and not quite enough Stan
ford defense against passing.
The Daily is a bit late wiih super
latives concerning this Mr. Howell,
and the* best thing we can do is
leave them implied. He was with
out much question the outstanding
player on the field which saw the
biggest all-star parade in 1934 in
tercollegiate football.
Stanford started the scoring pa
rade, and the first quarter ended
much as did those when the In
dians met U.C.L.A., Washington,
and Ihe other regular coast teams.
But it was the second period
that Stanford fans are dreaming
about after too much mince pic.
Howell started passing. He quit
passing al half tinjc for a few
moments with the count 22 to 7
in favor of the Tide.
Stanford began to show her face
above water in the third period
again. The halftime kickoff was
taken back some 75 yards on the
typical straight power to a (ouch
down. and the remainder of the
period remained without threats.
Just when the Indians were on
I the way toward overcoming a dis
gusting 15-point lead, the southern
ers took to the air again. This time
it was the 59-yard Howell-Hutson
! touchdown pass, which snapped off
| Stanford's last lingering chance at
victory, and the rest of the game
was spent in vain Cardinal thrusts
which almost, but not quite, scored
twice.
Cards Score Early
Late in the first period, the In
dians recovered Demyanovich's
fumble on the 27-yard stripe and
sliced through to the one-yard line
j on four successive plays. Bobby
; Grayson barely bucked over on his
j first chance, and Monk Moscrip
! added the point.
Bama started her first drive on
! the Cardinal 45. Howell passed to
I Hutson for 18; Howell to Angelich
for 11 more; Bryant on an end
I around gained the 21-yard line;
Howell to Hutson for 16 more to
the 5, and Howell, with a pass threat,
knifed through guard for the touch
down. Smith failed to convert, and
the South was behind, 6 to 7.
The Tide received the next kick
| off, and gained 20 yards on two run
ning plays; then Howell passed to
Hutson-twice to put the ball on the
Stanford 33, from where Howell
gained three on a running play. The
Dixie all-American made his first
incompleted pass at this point, but
countered with an 18-yard shot to
Bryant. Three more plays v/ere good
for but six yards, and Smith kicked
a field goal—9 to 7..
Howell Runs (57 Yards
Stanford again kicked, and Howell
I returned the ball to the 26; Angelich
j added seven, and Howell went over
left end for 67 yards to the: second
Bama touchdown. Smith kicked the
| goal to make it 16 to 7, with less than
j two minutes remaining in the half.
Stanford received, but Smith in
tercepted Stan Anderson's pass on
the Alabama 46. With Howell out
J of the game, Smith passed to Hutson
for 54 yards and another touchdown
j to give the Tide 22 points lor the
quarter's work.
