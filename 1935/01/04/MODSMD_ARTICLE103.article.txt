# CONGRESS MACHINE ROLLS BEFORE CAPACITY CROWD
## 
### 
( WASHINGTON, Jan. 3 (/P>. —A
new Congress, filled with many first
termers, sot out today for the 74th
running of the always colorful
! sweepstakes.
Engine, steering gear and most of
! the body were Democratic. There
were a few Republican accessories.
Iluey Gets Laugh
In its first day's roll the big ma
- chine ran past such incidents as a
wild outburst of rebel yells in the
House, the quiet wafting of a kiss
by Mrs. Joseph Byrns when her
husband came in as speaker, and
roaring laughter from floor and gal-
I leries when Senator Huey Lcng an
nounced by telegram that he whs
! coming up to make a speech next
| week.
A simultaneous crack of gavels at
noon set House and Senate under
way. Vice-President Garner, at first
looking not entirely comfortable in
formal cutaway and striped trousers,
promptly put the Senate to the

| swearing in of new members.
Byrns Installed
In the House, the business of for
mally electing the speaker—actually
chosen yesterday—held up proceed
ings long enough to allow some
marching back and forth and a little
! speech-making.
Once Byrns, lanky, white - haired
j Tennesseean, had been named pre
siding officer, a committee went out
and surrounded him. It led him
down in the ai'ile through standing,
applauding members.
Representative Snell, the veteran
New Yorker who had been the Re
publican choice for speaker, stood
| beside Byrns on the .rostrum and
presented him to the House. Byrns
and Snell alike received yells from
both Republicans and Democrats.
Capacity House
On both sides of the Capitol, there
j was almost a full representation on
i the floors and better than a full gaJ
; lery to watch. Cabinet members and
! lesser officials, notables and plain,
ordinary citizens wedged into the
! stalls of private galleries or crowded
1 into the public sections to watch
Congress on parade.
In the corridors outside, pretty
stenographers and dowagers with
; full chins jostled with clerks and
■ frock-coated men in an effort to
! impress upon doorkeepers that they
j were entitled to admission.
New Members Honored
Silentiy, some frankly nervous,
j new members sat watching their first
j session, waiting to be called down
to the front to raise their hand and
I take the time-honored oath of office.
In the House, they simply rose
I and wound up the formality in a
( jumbled, ■ general repetition. The
Senate marched its newcomers down
| by fours. Among them came Theo
dore G. Bilbo, who came from Mis
! sissippi to outdo Huey Long, and
Joseph GuiTey, the Pennsylvanian
who sent veteran David A. Reed
! back to law practice.
Rush D. Holt, the young West Vir
; ginian who has not yet reached the
legal age for Senate office holding,
remained seated when his name was
called. He will wait for his next
; birth anniversary to take his oath.
Long Promises Specch
From the gallery, Postmaster-
General Farley who, as chairman of
the Democratic National Committee
i had much to do with the alteration
of Congressional complexion, watch-
