# FARMER'S MAP OF CAMPUS FEATURED IN REVIEW ISSUE
## Scale of Map Taken From Aerial Photograph 
### 
One of the most interesting fea
tures of the December issue of the
Illustrated Review is a copy of the
map of the campus which was made
by Mr. Edward Farmer, head of the
Graphic Art department.
The map contains minute drawings
of all the houses on the campus, with
the dormitories lettered by name and
the houses on the row by their let
ters. It is drawn slightly in per
spective, and extends from the por
tals of Palm Drive to the golf course,
lunning north and south; and from
west of the Carnegie Institute labo
ratories to the R.O.T.C. stables and
the stadium on the east.
The scale of the map was taken
from an aerial photograph of the
campus, but the actual projection
was all done free-hand. The com
position and the printing were done
by a combination of the old hand
transfer and the newer photolith
processes.
In doing the work, Professor
Farmer had three plates of his
drawing made and filled in sepa
rately the colors by hand with wax
crayon on the plates themselves,
which accounts for the grained ef
fect of the prints.
It is interesting to note that the
separate houses are all recognizable
by the shapes of the roofs and the
parts of the buildings which are
visible. This is true of no previous
map of the campus.

Ed the opening proceedings.
Huey Long, with whom Farley
and the administration have had
their troubles, was not there, but he
made himself heard just the same.
"I'll come Monday and make a
speech," said, in effect, a telegram
sent by the Kingfish, which brought
a roar of laughter and a burst of
gavel pounding by Garner.
