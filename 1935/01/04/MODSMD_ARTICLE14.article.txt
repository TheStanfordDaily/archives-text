# COLLEGE EDITORS DENOUNCE HUEY
## Attack Faculty, Political Interference 
### 
Meeting in Washington, D.C., dur
ing the Christmas holidays, the first
convention of college newspaper ed
itors made a stand for freedom of
the college press, and against polit
ical meddling in education and com
mercialization of athletics.
Conceived and organized by the
Stanford Daily's editor, Stan Beau
baire, the convention brought to
gether editors from all over the
United States. In recognition of his
work in creating the convention,
Beaubaire was elected permanent
chairman. Ben Lieberman of Illi
nois was named secretary.
Huey Long Hit
Because they felt that a new per
sonnel would be desirable, Beaubaire
and Lieberman later withdrew and
four new officers were elected: D. H.
Hardeman of Texas, national chair
man; Amos Landman of Brown,
eastern regional chairman; Howard
Hudson of Chicago University, mid
western regional chairman; and
Beaubaire, western regional chair
man. The college editors will be or
ganized in the future so that a meet
ing will be held at least once a year.
The convention hit Senator Huey
Long, Kingfish of Louisiana, for his
"unwarranted censorship and sup
pression of news in the Louisiana
State Reveille, and for his dema
gogic political meddling in affairs
purely educational in nature." Guest
of honor at the convention was Jesse
Cutrer, student editor of the Reveille,
who was expelled by the Long po
litical machine. The convention also
censored President James M. Smith
of Louisiana State University for his
submission to the abridgement of
the students' rights of freedom of
speech and press.
Interference Flayed
The college editors flayed faculty
and political interference with edi
tors and the requirement of the au
thorities of some universities that
copy be submitted for approval prior
to publication.
Bound home from-the convention
on the Overland Limited, Beaubaire
is expected back on the campus
Monday or Tuesday after an event
ful eastern tour in which he met
many important men, including
President Roosevelt, Vice-President
Garner, Secretary of the Interior
Ickes, Arthur Brisbane, and Walter
Winchell.
