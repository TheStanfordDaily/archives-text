# LINDBERGH AND WIFE RECOUNT KIDNAP STORIES
## Hauptmann Stares Silently As Famed Pair Take Stand in Trial 
### 
FLEMINGTON, N.J., Jan. 3 f/P).—
Charles and Anne Lindbergh, par
ents of the golden-haired boy whom
Bruno Richard Hauptmann is
charged with kidnaping and killing,
bravely told a tense and hushed
courtroom today the tragic story of
their baby's empty crib.
First, for forty-five dramatic min
utes, the slight, brown-haired moth
er related what she knew of the
day and night of March 1, 1932,
when baby Charles Augustus Lind
bergh was stolen from the Sourland
Mountains home of his famous par
ents.
Bed Found Empty
Once her eyes gleamed as though
with tears, but she did not lose her
composure, as, in low, clear tones,
she said simply:
"I looked hastily at the bed—and
found it to be empty."
Then as Hauptmann, the stolid,
stoic carpenter, gazed fixedly at the
witness stand, Colonel Lindbergh
added to the grim narrative.
Firmly, the young airman told of
the quiet evening and then of the
frantic rush to the baby's nursery;
of the empty bed and the sinister
kidnap note on the window sill.
Lindy Testifies
"I saw the appearance of the
room . . . the bed . . . and realized
that something had gone wrong,"
he said.
The condition of the bed, Lind
bergh added, made him feel it was
impossible for the baby to have got
out himself. The bulging rise in the
bedclothing, caused by the child's
body, still was noticeable. The cov
ers still were pinned to the mattress.
The flier then told how he found
the first ransom note, lying on the
window sill in the southeast corner
of the room. The window was closed.
Anguish Concealed
Mrs. Lindbergh, pale and dressed
simply in black, faced Hauptmann,
but did not look at him as the pris
oner shifted occasionally in his chair.
The defense did not cross-examine
her.
What mental anguish she con
ceivably was enduring she con
cealed. In her manner at times was
just a trace of restraint. She smiled,
occasionally bit her lower lip, and
for the most part sat erect in the old
wooden chair, her legs crossed, her
elbows resting on the arms, her
hands lying in her lap.
Tells of Crash
When Mrs. Lindbergh had fin
ished, Wilentz called for Betty Gow,
then changed his mind and asked
Colonel Lindbergh to testify.
The famous flyer crossed .his legs
and told the jury of the domestic
events in his home before the dis
covery of the kidnaping.
"Sometime during that night did
you hear a crash?" the attorney
general asked him.
"Yes, I did," he replied.
"Was it such a noise as would
come from the falling of a ladder?"
"Yes, if it were outside."
He was sitting in the living room
with Mrs. Lindbergh at the time, he
he said, and his first impression was
that the slats of an orange box had
fallen from a kitchen table.
Stare at Each Other
Hauptmann, his chin resting in a
hand, let his gaze fall upon Lind
bergh. The latter turned his eyes
toward him.
For a moment they gazed directly
at each other, Hauptmann finally
breaking the contact by seeking a
spot on the judge's bench for the
object of a stare.
