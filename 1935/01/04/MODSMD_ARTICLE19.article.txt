# Laval Starts For Meeting With II Duce
## Takes Tentative Draft Of Franco-Italy Pact 
### 
PARIS, Jan. 3 (/P). —Foreign Min
ister Pierre Laval left Paris tonight
for his epoch-making visit to Pre
mier Benito Mussolini of Italy.
"Realizing the grave difficulties of
the present," he said, "we will de
fend together the interests of peace."
The foreign minister took with
him a tentative draft of the pro
posed Franco-Italian agreement to
assure Austria's independence and
guarantee the peace of Central Eu
rope, and proposals to settle the two
nations' colonial questions in Africa.
To Visit London
After his return from Rome, La
val, possibly in company with Pre
mier Pierre - Etienne Flandin, will
visit London to discuss European
matters, including Britain's recently
proposed general security pact, with
Sir John Simon, British Foreign
Secretary.
Essential details of the proposed
agreement concern
ing Austria were revealed to the
Associated Press tonight as Premier
Benito Mussolini set an elaborate
stage for his meeting tomorrow with
France's Foreign Minister, Pierre
Laval.
Favor Independence
An excellent authority said the
agreement would have these three
stages:
1. Mussolini and Laval will sign a
declaration in reference to Austrian
independence and announce the
presentation of a pact that, in effect,
would guarantee that independence
at Geneva.
2. Italy, Czechoslovakia, Yugosla
via, Austria and Hungary will be
asked to sign a five-power pact
which, while not specifically guar
anteeing Austrian independence,
will pledge each signatory not to
interfere in the internal 'affairs of
the others.
Halt Terrorists
3. Later other nations not neigh
bors of Austria, such as England,
France and Rumania, will be in
vited to adhere to the pact, although
these nations will not assume pre
cisely the same obligations as Aus
tria and her neighbors.
The second stage of the agree
ment, it was pointed out, could also
be invoked to halt the activities of
terrorists such as those which re
cently threatened to disturb rela
tions between Yugoslavia and Hun
gary.
The pact also would answer the
objection of Austria that she did not
relish being the object of such an
agreement, but preferred to partici
pate directly in it. The proposed
agreement would enable her to join
with the same rights and obligations
as other signatories.
Diplomatic circles said they be
lieved Adolf Hitler would find it
easier to join a mutual pact of this
nature than one definitely guaran
teeing Austrian independence.

"Realizing the grave difficulties of
the present," he said, "we will de
fend together the interests of peace."
The foreign minister took with
him a tentative draft of the pro
posed Franco-Italian agreement to
assure Austria's independence and
guarantee the peace of Central Eu
rope, and proposals to settle the two
nations' colonial questions in Africa.
To Visit London
After his return from Rome, La
val, possibly in company with Pre
mier Pierre - Etienne Flandin, will
visit London to discuss European
matters, including Britain's recently
proposed general security pact, with
Sir John Simon, British Foreign
Secretary.
Essential details of the proposed
agreement concern
ing Austria were revealed to the
Associated Press tonight as Premier
Benito Mussolini set an elaborate
stage for his meeting tomorrow with
France's Foreign Minister, Pierre
Laval.
Favor Independence
An excellent authority said the
agreement would have these three
stages:
1. Mussolini and Laval will sign a
declaration in reference to Austrian
independence and announce the
presentation of a pact that, in effect,
would guarantee that independence
at Geneva.
2. Italy, Czechoslovakia, Yugosla
via, Austria and Hungary will be
asked to sign a five-power pact
which, while not specifically guar
anteeing Austrian independence,
will pledge each signatory not to
interfere in the internal 'affairs of
the others.
Halt Terrorists
3. Later other nations not neigh
bors of Austria, such as England,
France and Rumania, will be in
vited to adhere to the pact, although
these nations will not assume pre
cisely the same obligations as Aus
tria and her neighbors.
The second stage of the agree
ment, it was pointed out, could also
be invoked to halt the activities of
terrorists such as those which re
cently threatened to disturb rela
tions between Yugoslavia and Hun
gary.
The pact also would answer the
objection of Austria that she did not
relish being the object of such an
agreement, but preferred to partici
pate directly in it. The proposed
agreement would enable her to join
with the same rights and obligations
as other signatories.
Diplomatic circles said they be
lieved Adolf Hitler would find it
easier to join a mutual pact of this
nature than one definitely guaran
teeing Austrian independence.
