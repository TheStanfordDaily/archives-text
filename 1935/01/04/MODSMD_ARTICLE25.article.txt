# Ye Olde Assemblie Halle And A New Theatre
## 
### 
The grotesque barnlike structure that
stands so unobtrusively between the Adminis
tration building and the .Memorial Court is
doomed as anything that can be identified with
the modern theatre. You call it the assembly
hall, and wonder why people venture within,
regardless of the olTering. You point to the
public high schools and junior colleges with
I heir up-to-date architecture. You wonder.
The Assembly hall is to be no more alter
this year as a theatre. Students, during the
past three years especially, have joi.ued forces
with faculty to get Stanford a theatre for the
good presentation of the legitimate drama.
Today's plans call for a half million dollar
structure that will embrace a School of Music
:inii a School of the Theatre to enrich the
Stanford curriculum. It is a worthy project, j
one that has taken much time, trouble, and 1
endless energy.
A question remains for immediate settle
ment. Students voted last spring to assess
themselves one dollar per quarter to defray
in pari the expense of giving Stanford this !
great luxury. The pavilion fee and the Union
dollar remain in force, and aid the earlv settle- !
I
inent o! any debts incurred. The students j
voted to assess themselves with the under- i
standing that actual construction, if not i 111- I
mediate, would start when the tuition fee went I
to one hundred and fifteen dollars. Yesterday, ;
you registered for the winter quarter, and you j
recall, with perhaps a few tears, that your
check was for that amount.
The Executive committee, at the end of the
autumn quarter, went on record as asking the :
Board of Trustees to start collecting the dollar
with the stipulation that construction will
shirt by June of this year.
It is now lime that the students are given
an absolute guarantee that this will he taken j
care of. Architects, of course, can easily find j
plenty of means to waste time between now !
and June to delay construction another year j
at least while the student fees pile up in the J
records. I hev may, too, complete their work 1
much before June (as in the case of Lagunita
Court last year) to place the new theatre under
construction hv that time.
The students at large haven't yet expressed j
opinion on the matter except in personal re
marks to the editor. It is time to have campus j
sentiment on this subject brought into the
open, and called to the attention of the proper j
authorities. Letters addressed to this pa per-j
will be printed for your perusal.
I he theatre must be ready for autumn quar- i
ler, 193f>, or the dollar should be refunded to
the students now. Or campus sentiment to the
contrary should he made public at once. If
Ihe students do not care, and w;ish to pay their
money without personally seeing the new
building, all well and good.
