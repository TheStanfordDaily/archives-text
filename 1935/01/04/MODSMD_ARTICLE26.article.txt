# Alabama Stars That Fell on Stanford
## 
### 
I wenty-nine l<> thirteen; sweet and lovely,
and alter all, what more is there to say? Even
I lie most confirmed and vociferous Stanford
supporler will admit that it was one swell
Mi!ilie, the hest, in lad, that they had ever seen.
Some <>l the local critics declaim that Stan
hud never will make a representative showing
in the Hose Howl, as long as the t'niversily
continues to operate on the quarter system,
and the athletes must contend with the added
mental hazard of finals week.
I rue or not true, as the observation in the
hist paragraph may he, it is doubtful if Stan
lord s current Hose Howl contenders were
hampered by any finals week bugaboo. Stan
ford's Indians played great football, well
worthy ol Hose Howl teams. They were
beaten, fairly and squarely beaten, by an
Alabama squadron, which unconsciously
"hot or naturally super-great, was emphati
cally the best team on Tuesday afternoon.
the superior character of the play was in
directly a tribute to the perspicacity of the
Hose Howl committe in choosing Stanford as
the western defender, and it likewise con
firmed Stanford s selection of the Crimson
I ide as an outstanding and eminently suitable
opponent.
(ileal teams, superior players, thrilling
game. And as lor this talk of no more Hose
Howl bids lor Stanford because of their
weak record, it is questionable that the
Pasadena promoters will turn the Indians
down in Iproviding their record war
rants a return appearance.
And lastly, it was a complete financial
success. After all, what more is there to sav?
