# The 						Winds of Freedom Again
## 
### 
Allcr several sporadic attempts, some highly
successful and interesting and certain others !
that tailed to ring the hell, hist year's stu- |
dent forum finally died a lingering death. So
far no one has seen fit to exhume the corpse
and attempt In lu ing it to life this year.
The Daily believes that the student forum
\v;is ;i good idea, still is ;i good idea, and should
he revived. Those who heard any of last
year's willy word halites will prohahlv second
Ihe motion. II a revival is to he successful,
however, it inusl he carefully managed. Topics
lo he discussed must he timely, controversial, 1
and of general interest. The I'oruin should

meet only when such a topic is available.
There will probably he no dearth of subjeet
matter for lively discussions for several
months now. Congress is in session and
things have :i habit of flopping when Congress
is on the scene. Controversial local topics
frequentlv arise also.
Stanford University has a freedom of
thought and expression equalled by few col
leges in the West. Such freedom is meaning
less, however, unless it is used. A public
forum is the ideal means for using this
privilege.
A so far inactive student forum committee
exists. II is hoped that they will soon revive
these public discussions. Let verbiage be tin
confined !
