Yesterday marked the opening of the great
annual Washington show, a new Congress.
Presided over by a new speaker of the Mouse.
1935 leaders will find much important legis
lation awaiting them.
Such a majority as neither Republicans nor
Democrats have bad since the days after the
Civil War when the good old (r.O.P's con
trolled the government, looms ahead for the
Democrats this session.
However, all appears to be clear sailing,
since Speaker of the House Byrnes and his
fellow members seem inclined to give Presi
don Roosevelt a free hand, and allow him to
eonti-nue the policies which he has planned to
put into effect during 19.'}.").
It will be interesting to see whether the
President will hold his Congress together and
completely dominate them, as he has done
since 1933, or whether a new session will
bring in its wake new and more aggressive
leaders, who may assume a stand hostile to
thai followed by administration leaders :it the
present time.
