TREITSCHKE AND HITLER
(Note: Below is printed with the consent of the
author, excerpts from a paper read last week at
the thirtieth annual convention of the American
Historical Association, Pacific Coast Branch, held
at Stanford University. Dr. S. K. Padover is a
member of University of California history fac
ulty, and the author of the recently published
book. "The Revolutionary Emperor, Joseph II.")
"Those unacquainted with German history might
find it surprising that there should be a parallelism
between the ideas of a famous academic historian and
the leader of the Nazis. Yet both Treitschke and Hitler
were rooted in the same culture and their ideology was
the result of half a millenium of German history. Both
men were the product of the German 'soul,' tc use n
favorite word of Treitschke, which was chaotic, unsure
of itself, and burdened with a sense of inferiority.
"Germany, alone among the great people of Europe,
never succeeded in creating a centralized, united, ho
mogeneous state, but was split into several hundred
principalities, differing in religion, institutions and
'race.' Even Bismarck never really united Germany,
except in a superficial political sense, and half a cen
tury later Hitler found it necessary to boast that his
greatest achievement was the creation of a united—
totalitarian—Reich.
"The key to the understanding of both Treitsch
ke and Hitler lies in this sense of national infe
riority among upper-class Germans. This explains
their virulent hatred of non-Germans, especially
French, English, and Jews. For Treitschke. like
Hitler, was the impassioned apostle of violence and
race hatred, and his venom infected a whole
generation of Germans.
"It is significant that Treitschke. like Hitler,
was not a blond 'Nordic.' He was largely Slav,
being of Czech descent.
"Two motives dominated Treitschke's life, patriot
ism and hatred, one supplementing the other. It was
a pathological patriotism, so sick that it required hatred
for its self-assertion and violence for its self-realiza
tion. Hence his uncontrolled flaying of south Germans.
Catholics, 'particularists,' liberals, socialists and Jews.
"Treitschke despised the finer elements in German
civilization and espoused those German ideas and in
stillations which foreigners find so revolting. In his
idea of the State he outdid the Hohenzollerns, preach
ing, not logically, but insistently, that the State was
based upon force. This concept of the State had two
implications: first, only a large and powerful govern
ment deserved respect; consequently the small German
stales were contemptible and should be wiped out.
Secondly, war was the greatest good of a strong State.
Treitschke urged both doctrines.
"War Treitschke considered the noblest activity of
society. 'War,' he said, 'must be taken as part of the
divinely appointed order.' War steels and ennobles
mankind. It is inevitable, because of 'human sins and
passions.' He spoke of the 'moral majesty of war.'
"Germany having defeated France (1870) and
having established a powerful Reich. Treitschke
thought it was time that the empire return to its
pristine glory and begin to dominate the weaker
nations of Europe. The Germans, lie said blandly,
had given civilization to Europe. The Reich should
also revive the naval glory of the old Itansa, should
become the great trans-Atlantic power, and
should acquire Holland—that lost sister.
"Such ambitions and ideas inevitably drove Treit
schke to mad hatred for England, a hostility which had
envy for its basis. Catholics, socialists, liberals, and
Jews fared no better than the English, which again
shows the proverbial repetition of history. Treitschke
scorned Catholics for the same reason Hitler does:
because they owe obedience to a spiritual (foreign)
head.
"And so the circle of Treitschke's hates was com
plete and the basis for Hitlerism was laid. The poison
which Treitschke infused into Germany took effect,
and even half a century before Hitler, Ernest Renan,
seeing the dangerous drift of Germany, issued a sad
warning to German intellectuals.
"Treitschke, let us remember, was not merely a
scholar; lie was not an isolated individual 'crying
in the wilderness.' lie may be considered ns the
voice of oHicial, imperial, Germany. A friend of
Bismarck, a prominent member of the Reichstag,
a distinguished professor at the greatest Geiman
university (Berlin), the official Historiographer i
Royal of Prussia—Treitschke spoke with authority
and his voice was heard throughout the Reich.
11 is words found a prolonged reverberation and.
even today, one can easily trace his ideas in the
pronouncements of thr Nazis.
"Not so long ago the German historian Meineckf
referred to him as a 'great and noble personality,' and
ihe equally eminent historian Erich Marcks spoke of
Treitschke as 'a royal person of glowing and strong
soul who marched victoriously over the heights of j
his time.' The Nazis would probably agree with that."

TREITSCHKE AND HITLER

"Those unacquainted with German history might
find it surprising that there should be a parallelism
between the ideas of a famous academic historian and
the leader of the Nazis. Yet both Treitschke and Hitler
were rooted in the same culture and their ideology was
the result of half a millenium of German history. Both
men were the product of the German 'soul,' tc use n
favorite word of Treitschke, which was chaotic, unsure
of itself, and burdened with a sense of inferiority.
