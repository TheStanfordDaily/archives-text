# HUMORISTS RESTING Chappie Issues 'Breather' OLD GUARD PUFFING
## 
### 
With the record of complete sell
outs for every issue of Chaparral
so far this year, Editor Gordon
Steedman is giving his merry quip
piers a "breather issue" in order
that the old timers of the staff can
show the young upstarts that they
can write sell-out copy too.
Old Chaparral wits from the good
old times are coming out of their
caves, trees, and ditches for miles
around to tell of the bopm days of
Prohibition when funny men had
funnier things to be funny with,
according to the Venerable Cuckoo.
Since Stecclman's usual campaign
for copy will be among old Hammer
and Coffin men, student contributors
do not need to worry about deadline.
The ' Old Timer's" Issue will be out
about the middle of the month, says
Old Boy Steedman.
Mary Livingstone, of the Women's
Wear and Tear Department, wishes
that it be known that she wants to
see all her women tryoutees within
a week.
