I I
. HAPPY NEW YEAR?
As everyone had anticipated, the
old year passed. Like every other
year, it had been welcomed into life
with the optimism that is born of
alcohol. It passed out unmourned
into the oblivion of unfulfilled hopes.
For 1934 was a washout.
Nineteen thirty-four recognized
many problems it had to deal with.
There was the threat of war, and
unemployment, and general inse
curity. There was a need J'or in
ternational friendship, and birth
control, and official honesty. And
1934 (which was hailed as the "op
portunity year") muffed its big
chance. Kipling's "Light That
Failed" was a howling success com
pared with the score of the old year.
Armies were being mobilized in
every section of the globe. Mussolini
was even robbing the cradle to fill
his battalions. Tariff walls were
still rising. Dictatorships on a half
dozen fronts were squelching life
and liberty, while falling standards
of living were making fast work of
happiness. Real solutions were still
not in evidence.
That sounds like a hell of a way
to start the new year. Glum, grue
some, and grotesque. But unfortu
nately, that is what happened. And
that is the way 1934 must be con
sidered if 1935 is to be a mite better.
Nineteen thirty-five will be a cru
cial year, not only because every
year is a crucial year, but because
Ihe immediate past has left us on a
downhill grade with the brakes slip
ping and the gears stripped. The
unemployed millions must be dealt
with lest they become unemployed
mobs, and the unborn millions must
be dealt with, lest THEY become un
employed millions, and so on, ad in
finitum.
The 74th Congress got off to a
typical Congressional start: babbling
Congressmen refusing to shut-up
even for the roll-call. Those Con
gressmen, and those Senators, and
the President must do something—
genuine and constructive. Unless
they do, 1935 will not be a happy
new year, but just another horribly
long 365 days.
Thus we greet the new year, not
happy but hopeful.

they do, 1935 will not be a happy
new year, but just another horribly
long 365 days.
Thus we greet the new year, not
happy but hopeful.

I I
. HAPPY NEW YEAR?
As everyone had anticipated, the
old year passed. Like every other
year, it had been welcomed into life
with the optimism that is born of
alcohol. It passed out unmourned
into the oblivion of unfulfilled hopes.
For 1934 was a washout.
Nineteen thirty-four recognized
many problems it had to deal with.
There was the threat of war, and
unemployment, and general inse
curity. There was a need J'or in
ternational friendship, and birth
control, and official honesty. And
1934 (which was hailed as the "op
portunity year") muffed its big
chance. Kipling's "Light That
Failed" was a howling success com
pared with the score of the old year.
Armies were being mobilized in
every section of the globe. Mussolini
was even robbing the cradle to fill
his battalions. Tariff walls were
still rising. Dictatorships on a half
dozen fronts were squelching life
and liberty, while falling standards
of living were making fast work of
happiness. Real solutions were still
not in evidence.
That sounds like a hell of a way
to start the new year. Glum, grue
some, and grotesque. But unfortu
nately, that is what happened. And
that is the way 1934 must be con
sidered if 1935 is to be a mite better.
Nineteen thirty-five will be a cru
cial year, not only because every
year is a crucial year, but because
Ihe immediate past has left us on a
downhill grade with the brakes slip
ping and the gears stripped. The
unemployed millions must be dealt
with lest they become unemployed
mobs, and the unborn millions must
be dealt with, lest THEY become un
employed millions, and so on, ad in
finitum.
The 74th Congress got off to a
typical Congressional start: babbling
Congressmen refusing to shut-up
even for the roll-call. Those Con
gressmen, and those Senators, and
the President must do something—
genuine and constructive. Unless
they do, 1935 will not be a happy
new year, but just another horribly
long 365 days.
Thus we greet the new year, not
happy but hopeful.
