For four years a Stanford tradi
tion, $114 for tuition and community
fees is no more. Upped to $115 the
middle of last quarter by Ex Com

the proposed New Theatre, tuition
will henceforth follow the trend
toward "higher education."
Though the "Theatre Dollar" was
approved by an overwhelming vote
of the students last year, many stu
dents had forgotten that this morn
ing when they stepped up to the
cashier's cage to pay their money
and take their choice.
