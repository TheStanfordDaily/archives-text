# Signal Misunderstanding Blamed for Ship Collision
## 
### 
NEW YORK. Jan. 3 (/P).â€”A mis
understanding in signals sent the
steamer Lexington to the bottom of
the East River last night, testimony
at a federal inquiry showed today.
Less than 20 hours after the tramp
freighter Jane Christenson cleft the
Long Island Sound steamer in twain,
the Steamboat Inspection Service
opened its inquiry into the collision
with Captain George Fried, hero of
many a disaster at sea, in charge.
