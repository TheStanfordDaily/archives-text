# '95 Examiner Tells Trials of Roughs
## 
### 
Tucked away in one of the many
files of the library devoted to the
history of Stanford is a page from
the San Francisco Examiner of
Christmas Day, 1895.
It is a page made up of articles by
Stanford students, some of them
persons who have since become
famousâ€”C. K. Field, '95, now "Chee
rio" on the radio; E. M. Hulme, '97,
now Professor Hulme and a noted
historian; and Will Irwin, '98, now
a writer of note.
Under the heading "As a Co-Ed
Views the Ed" is a letter purporting
to be from a Stanford woman to
her chum back home telling all
about the Rough. According to this
particular co-ed, the Rough was not
always as fearless as he has been
painted. "Co-education is not at
all what I thought it would be,"
reads the letter. "Sometimes a boy
is thrown with a girl every day for
two years, and stares at her but
never has nerve enough to get some
one to introduce him!
"There are a few, though, who
walk around the Quad hour after
hour with the same girl and look
very happy." But this shyness is
adequately explained, for, says the
writer in another place, "Many of
these | men | live at Encina, in the
wilderness away from the refining
influence of co-eds."
The "Ed" has his innings on the
opposite side of the page, where
Charles S. Burnell, now a Superior
Court judge in Los Angeles, de
scribes the co-ed and the tortures
one suffered when calling on her
at old Roble Hall (now Sequoia).
"Perhaps you will call on her at

Roble Hall. You don a dress suit, if
you or your roommate own one (al
though white duck tennis trousers
are occasionally" worn), and medi
tating of the bright remarks you in
tend to make you will proceed to
Roble's portal. A co-ed comes to
the door in answer to your ring, and
leaves you standing in the hallway
between two tables, at which sit
other co-eds, while she calls up the
young lady you wish to see. The
calling is done through a tube, and
the correct form is: 'Oh, Miss' Dash!'
" 'Yes, what is it?'
" 'Please tell Miss (mumble mum
ble) that Mr. Blank would like to
see her.'
'"Mr. Who?'
" 'Mr. Blank (this very distinctly;
all the girls at the table nudge each
other and you feel sure 4hat they
are grinning, but dare not look).'
" 'Who is the young lady he wishes
to see?'
" 'Miss So-and-so.'
" 'Oh, all right.'
"There is a pause. You are sure
your necktie is crawling up your
collar, the co-eds at the table titter,
and you know you are the subject
of their merriment. Then the mys
terious tube delivers the information
to all whom it may (or may not)
concern that Miss So-and-so will
see you in the parlor.
"If you are a sensible man, in
stead of calling at Roble you will
prefer wandering through the ar
boretum, exploring the French
man's lake, or going wheeling | bi
cycling to modern readers |. Then,
indeed, you will have a chance to
get acquainted with the co-ed as
she really is."
