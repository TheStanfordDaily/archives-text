SALINAS, Jan. 3 (/P).â€”For
years highway cops have been
demanding of speeding motor
ists, "Who do you think you
are, Bax'ney Oldfield!"
Today it was Barney Oldfield.
The noted auto racer was
cited for speeding on the high
way north of Salinas by High
way Patrolman A. W. Martin,
who said Oldfield had the usual
cigar stuck in his mouih, with
the wind whipping the ashes off
at 60 miles an hour.
