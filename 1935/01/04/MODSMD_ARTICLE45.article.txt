# SOCIAL WORKER TO SPEAK IN CHAPEL
## 
### 
Miss Muriel Lester, England's
most famous social service worker,
may not feel at ease when she speaks
from the pulpit of Stanford's chapel
Sunday.
Her eyes will not be seeing the
well-dressed audience that sits be
fore her'. Perhaps she will be think
ing of a mob of coolies squatting
sullenly in some waterfront dive in
China, or of a silent, hard-faced
group of English laborers, who
stepped off London's reeking Bow
Street to hear her preach.
For luxury is admittedly not Miss
Lester's forte. During her lifetime
consecrated to the care of England's
sick and poor, she has learned to
see comfort in a drab shack, happi
ness in the smile of a street urchin.
As the English "Jane Addams" she
has made the slums her battlefield
against destitution and disease.
Today she can point to Kingsley
Hall, Bow, London, as the crowning
glory of her career, just as Miss
Addams can point to Hull House.
She feels that England's poverty
problem is on its way to solution,
so she is now on her way to the
Orient, where she believes there is
a place for those who can dun the
ears of high officials until the sick
receive care and the children have
food.
Following her sermon, four organ
selections, "The Old Year Hath
Passed Away," "Break Forth, O
Beauteous Heavenly Light," and
"How Shall I Fitly Meet Thee," by
Bach, and "When Christ Was Born
of May Fx-ee," by Leopold Stokow
ski, will complete the morning serv
ices.
Warx-en D. Allen will give his
regular organ recital at 4 o'clock.
