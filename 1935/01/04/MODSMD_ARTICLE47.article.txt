# McGrath Asks House Inquiry On Naval Jobs
## Struggles To Obtain Work For Coast Yards 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 3 (/P).â€”An
investigation by the Naval Affaix's
Committee of the award of con
tracts for 24 navy vessels last fall
was asked in the House today by
Representative McGrath (D., Cal.).
The object of the investigation, as
set forth in a resolution by McGrath,
would be to discover why ship
builders on the Pacific Coast who
submitted low bids on four ships
were unable to post bonds to qualify
their bids.
Threaten Industry
McGrath, member of the Naval
Committee, said in the resolution
that because no navy shipbuilding
had gone to the West Coast yards,
the once flourishing Coast industry
is threatened with destruction.
McGrath also reintroduced his bill
for government purchase of the
Union Iron Works and the Hunter's
Point drydock on San Francisco Bay.
McGrath first presented his bill
last session but it did not receive
consideration.
Preparedness Needed
The Union Iron Works and the
drydock are owned by the Bethle
hem Shipbuilding Company.
"It is evident the Bethlehem does
not intend to bid on naval construc
tion for its West Coast yards," Mc-
Grath said. "Efficient shipyards on
the West Coast are necessary as a
second line of defense. With the
fleet in the Pacific the necessity for
preparedness on the Coast is em
phasized."
McGrath said the government's
operation at the Mare Island and
Bremerton navy yards had demon
strated ships could be built better
and cheaper on the West Coast, due
to conditions which permitted work
the year around.
