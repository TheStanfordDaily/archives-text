# Merriam's Program Will Ask "Balanced Budget"
## 
### 
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 3
ernor Merriam said today the pro
gram he will submit to the 1935
Legislature will call for a "balanced
budget." Although declining to re
veal any parts of the program, he
said firmly:
"An ad valorem tax will not be
included in any plan I submit."
Asked if his program for a bal
anced budget will include the esti
mated $32,000,000 deficit at the close
of the 1933-35 biennium in June, he
said:
"Whatever deficit exists on July 1
will be treated as a separate mat
ter and not as a part of the budget."
