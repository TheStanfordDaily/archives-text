### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 3 (£>).—'The
i 74th Congress, meeting in a cheer-
I ful atmosphere, fell into controversy
' within an hour today over a House
Republican recovery program which
■ caused reverberations at both ends
of the Capitol.
While Democrats awaited Presi
dent Roosevelt's message tomorrow
to give them the first look at the
course he wants Congress to follow,
, a 20-point program was issued by
House G.O.P. chieftains that called
down both praise and criticism. Some
Republican liberals regarded it as
too conservative.
