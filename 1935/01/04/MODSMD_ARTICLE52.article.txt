# Portland Fog and Ice Cause Traffic Troubles
## 
### 
PORTLAND, Ore., Jan. 3 (#>).â€”
Fog and ice, attending the coldest
morning in nearly two years, threw
automobile traffic into utter confu
sion here today. Scores of cars
jumped curbings, pounded against
other machines and into ditches. The
fog limited visibility to a few feet
and the ice made it impossible to
stop.
No serious injuries were reported
in several hundred accidents. At 8
a.m. the temperature slipped down
to 28 degrees.
President Andrew Johnson was a
tailor for seven years before he
learned the alphabet.
