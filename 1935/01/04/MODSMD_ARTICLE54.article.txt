ing resolutely, collected its third win
in nine games by defeating a some
what distracted Creighton Univer

counters, 33-29, here tonight. The
two teams will play again tomorrow
night.
After 14 minutes of play, the West
Coast outfit found itself out in
front, 18-8, due to some snappy pass
ing and the individual work of Ken
neth Nobs, elongated center, who
scored four field goals.
Excitement rose to a high pitch in
the dying minutes of the game as
Creighton was able to draw within
two points. But the Hilltoppers' on
rush was staved off as Stanford
gained possession of the ball and
kept it.
As the final gun burst, Bill Quade.
Stanford forward, got away from the
Creighton defense for an undergoal
shot and made it.
