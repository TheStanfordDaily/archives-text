# Rose Bowl Stunts Finish Work of Rally Committee
## 
### 
Members of the Rally Committee,
under the direction of Julius Jacobs,
completed their season's duties with
the organization of the mooting sec
tion and planning of card stunts for
the Rose Bowl game.
The 30 members of the committee
distributed stunt cards the morning
of the game, and organized the sec
tion as game time approached.
The first stunt was a Stanford tree
on a background with a white "S."
Other stunts consisted of a picture
of "Borres" Hamilton, an ail-Ameri
can shield, and an outline of the
state of Alabama, which gradually
was changed into California with a
large "S" in the foreground.
