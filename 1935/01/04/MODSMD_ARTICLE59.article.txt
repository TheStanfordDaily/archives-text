## TWO INDIAN BUTCHES COST MANY POINTS 
### 
Stanford made a couple of rather serious mistakes in the Rose Bowl
Tuesday—one of these just happened, the other has been on its way all
year.
The first was the insistence on kicking off in the second quarter.
It usually is good football for an exceptional defensive team to kick off
and move the game into the opposition's end of the field.
But Stanford kicked after the first Alabama touchdown, which was all
right, except that Bama ran the ball through to another score. Then the
Indians kicked off again. That, it seems, was the mistake. They had been
driven crazy with passes all during that period, and it was psychologically
as well as physically impossible for them to pull themselves together, so
Alabama proceeded to score twice more from far out in the field.
All of this rehash is getting to the fact that the Indians might have
climbed back on to an even they had received once and opened a
drive of their own—just to break up the stream of successful Bama passes.
