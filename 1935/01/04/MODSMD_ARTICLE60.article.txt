# COULDN'T BEAT 'EM AT THEIR OWN GAME

Another little mistake did not permit Alabama to score, but it did cut
down Stanford's chances of retrieving the lead.
That was the Indian insistence on passing. Stanford had not passed
all year, but they waited until they met the greatest passing team
in the country to try out their air attack. The Cardinals tried 24 tosses,
five of which were completed, and the Indian aerial raid on the whole
looked bad.
Early in the third quarter, the Cards opened up the power, and they
scored a clean touchdown. They started it again a few moments later, but
this time, with their running attack clicking perfectly they wasted many
valuable downs on feeble passes that fell incomplete or were intercepted.
