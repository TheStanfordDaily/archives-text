# "HORSE'S" KICKOFF ONE OF HIGHLIGHTS
## 
### 
All-American Bob Reynolds takes credit for the prize kickoff of the
year. In the second quarter, Reynolds booted»the ball 85 yards in the air.
It sailed high above the goal posts, but to the side, and came to rest some
15 yards behind the end zone.
Some blame the score on Stanford's pass defense. Although the
Indian alertness did not touch that shown in the Washington game,
this writer believes the Cards played as good a defensive game as
could be expected from anyone in the face of that bombing party.
The Rose Bowl crowd was as non-partisan as any seen on the Coast
this year. Cheers came up indiscriminately from all parts of the stadium
when a spectacular play was made, and on one occasion, one solid "boo"
was heard from all parts of the Bowl as a questionable penalty was in
flicted.
Sportsmanship, for the most part, was evident throughout. The captain
of each team was seen to pat the referee on the shoulder when a penalty
was made on his own team. None of the usual moaning.
