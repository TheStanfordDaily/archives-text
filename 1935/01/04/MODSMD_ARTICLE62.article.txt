# THREE PLAYS DECIDED GAME
## 
### 
There were three key plays, any one of which may have decided the
game.
The first two of these came with but two minutes remaining in
the first half. With Alabama maintaining a two-point lead, and the
stadium united in expecting the Tide to coast into the intermission,
Dixie Howell broke loose with that 67-yard spurt to a touchdown.
Added to the other two scoring drives, this in itself would have made
many teams give up in disgust. But Alabama added insult to injury with
but one minute to go, when Riley Smith passed to Don Hutson for another
score.
That did not kill Stanford hope, however, and the Indians came out
with a drive of their own after the halt-time talking-to.
They successfully cut the lead by one touchdown and were going after
another, when Bama grabbed the ball at the start of the fourth quarter
and with one play—a pass from Howell to Hutson—nullified the work of
an entire quarter. This was the final straw, and Stanford did not quite
recover from it during the remaining 14 minutes of play.
