# Transfers Strengthen Varsity Track Team
## 
### 
Card track fans watching yester
day's enrollment were pleased to
J see the names of Warren Dixon and
Ray Dean, two San Mateo Junior
College transfers who should con
siderably strengthen the distance
and sprint departments of Dink
Templeton's 1935 varsity.
Dixon has led J.C. milers and half
milers in northern California for the
past two years, and has a 4:24 mile
and a 1:58 half-mile to his credit.
Giving much needed reinforcements
I in the sprints, Deane will probably
; compete in the 100 and 220, and has
a mark of 9.8 seconds in the century
as his best to date.
For Bill Ellington's frosh Stanley
Marks, a widely reputed discus
j thrower from Butte, Montana, also
registered for the first time yester
day.
