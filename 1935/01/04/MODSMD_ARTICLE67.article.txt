# Card Teams Excell in '34
## 
### 
Stanford rode the crest of the
waves in at least three sectors of
the sports world during 1934. In
football, well, even if the Indians
did not win the Rose Bowl, they did
claim the title of the best team on
the Pacific Coast, a claim earned by
their record of eight victories and
one tie in competition with their
regional competitors.
Trackmen Win
In track and field, the Cardinal
dominated the intercollegiate scene
as their spectacular seven-man team
triumphed in the I.C.A.A.A.A. at
Philadelphia with 35V4 points, lead
ing Yale and the University of Cali
fornia. A short while later at Los
Angeles the Redmen rang up 62

points to lead U.S.C. and Louisiana
State in the N.C.A.A.
And in golf, Lawson Little carried,
1 unofficially of course, the Stanford
name to the victor's pedestal at
Prestwick, Scotland, where the long
driving star of the tees won the
British Amateur title after playing
a great part in the triumph of the
American Walker Cup team.
Little Takes U.S. Title
Late in the summer, Little packed
his woods and irons to America's
historic old Brookline, there to take
the American Amateur title with a
sparkling exhibition of superlative
golf.
In other sports the Indian fared
not so well. Basketball followers
found them placing third in the

southern division of the Pacific Coast
Conference race. They did manage
to steal one game of the California
series, thereby knocking the Golden
Bears out of a conference tie with
U.S.C.
Baseball, hmmn, not so good.
Stanford lost all of the California
series, won a single game from
U.S.C. and four from St. Mary's.
Stanford ruggers played a tie
with U.C.L.A. in a match to deter
mine the collegiate championship of
California. The same men lost their
; international meeting with the Brit
j ish Columbia "Reps," 3-0.
Tennis men were wracked with
I injuries, and could win but two in
I six matches with U.C., U.S.C., and
| U.C.L.A.
