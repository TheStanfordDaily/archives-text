# Lack of Bald Heads Noted in Congress
## 
### 
(Note: The following are the per- t
sonal observations of Stan Beau- j
baire, Daily editor, at the opening
of the 74th Congress. Beaubaire is I
in Washington attending a conven- j
tion of college newspaper editors.) !
WASHINGTON, Jan. 3.â€”Congress 1
is a great show. We crashed the
Senate and House press galleries !
and learned that at least 75 per cent l
ot the legislators are not bald, nor do '
they wear toupees. Twenty-five per ]
cent lean on their elbows during |
the sessions. Three-fourths of the
spectators in the galleries are worn- j
en. Congress is just a bunch of
good fellows. Members of both j
houses enjoyed themselves glad
handing each other before the real
battle.
Somebody made a mistake when j
swearing in Representative Byrns, j
new speaker of the House. He was \
too anxious and almost gave Byrns j

the oath before he was introduced.
Hiram Johnson is a good scout and
does not admit any Red scare on j
California campuses. He says he be
lieves in education that presents both j
sides of the case but opposes propa-: '
ganda from aliens.
I talked to Mrs. Roosevelt for five
seconds en route in an elevavor be
tween two floors. She would not
commit herself on co-education and
the place of the co-ed in activities.
Secretary Ickos seerried embar
rassed at his press conference today
when confronted with White House
rumors that he had been asked to
discharge two trusted aides. He de
nied the report. They are evidently
after Ickes here.
Huey Long didn't show up, so we j
couldn't ask him personally what he ,
thinks of college editors. He did not ;
answer the query we wired him
from the convention.
