# Frosh Quintet Plays In Double-Header Tonight
## 
### 
Coach Jimmy Bradshaw's frosh
basketball five will meet Palo Alto
High and Menlo Junior College to
night and tomorrow night in the
Encina gymnasium.
During the vacation the frosh
journeyed up the Sacramento Val
ley, deleating Auburn High 31-18.
and Stockton High 31-30. Hank
Luisetti, center, was high scorer in
both contests.
While the prep "five will probably
offer little opposition to Bradshaw's
heavy and rangy quintet, Menlo will
be the best competition the frosh
have met this season. Last year's
frosh, defeated but twice, won from
Menlo only after a hectic overtime
period.
The frosh line-up will be .Luisetti
and Dick Lyon or Dick Bigler, for
wards; Bob Zonne, center; and Nelly
Heath and H. B. Lee or Berneth
Layer, guards.
