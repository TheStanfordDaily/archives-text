NAVAL BASE, San Pedro, Jan. 3
(/P). â€”The roar of big guns at sea,
off the California Coast tonight
marks the beginning of the year's
test to see whether Uncle Sam's
naval gunners are what fleet officers
believe them to be, the best in the
world.
The fastest fighting craft of the
United States fleet, the squadron of
heavy cruisers, opened up with their
eight-inch main batteries as a cur
tain-riser of the year's gunnery
tests.

Military training in all schools
and colleges in Canton has been
made compulsory by a government
decree which,calls for 400 instruc
tors to supervise the drilling.
