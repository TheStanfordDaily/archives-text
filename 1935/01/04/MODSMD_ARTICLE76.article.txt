## 
### 
l One week from tomorrow what j
; promises to be a powerful Stanford j
| rugby team will start its schedule as j
, a member of the California Rugby
! Union.
The Union consists of teams from
! U.S.C., U.C., U.C.L.A., Stanford,
US.F., and the Olympic Club, Clare
! Mont, Barbarians, Argonauts, and
| S.F. Blues.
| In addition to the local Union an ,
Intercollegiate League has been
j formed, in which the four teams of
i the Coast Conference will each play
| one game with the other three.
Team Experienced
Coach Harry Maloney is not as yet
j sure of the official schedule, but he j
| is sure of a bang-up combination of |
15 experienced men. A large sign
up greeted him yesterday, with sev
l eral of the football men indicating
intentions to come out.
From Pasadena come Johnny Reis- i
ner, Ray Lewis, Jack Walton, Larry
Cooke, Joe Vigna, and possibly Frank
Alustiza and other footballers.
Last year's veterans coming back j
to play will include Captain Roger
Hager. George Wyman, Jim Mullen,
Frank Ingersoll, George Fuller, Otto
Bansbach, Aylett Cotton, Dick Beck- !
er, and Primo Pinotti.
Trip Cancelled
The expected trip to British Co
j lumbia was not made this winter,
j due to the fact that the four Cali
j fornia college teams were not able to
| choose five representatives to go, the
; football season lasting too long,
i Arrangements have been made, ;
however, to the effect that a Cana- ;
dian team will come to California
this spring, and the California team j
will be sent north next winter.
