Stanford's barnstorming basketball
team plays its last game tonight in
i Omaha, Nebraska, where ihe Cards
face the Creighton University quin
tet in the second game of a two
' game series.
Coach John Bunn's men, while
i gaining in experience, have met with
little success on their extended trip.
The Indians played their first game
against Utah University in Ogden on
| December 20, where they lost 46-37.
On the following evening in Salt
Lake City, Stanford gained revenge
on the Utes by winning 48-38. Con
tinuing on their journey the- Cards
stopped oil in Kansas City where on
Christmas Eve they were defeated
by the White Eagle Oil Company,
44-25.
Arne Anderson and Kenneth Bell
were high point men in this game,
scoring three field goals apiece. The
Oil Company has been champion of
â™¦he Kansas City League for the past
five years, and the Cards could not
cope with their attack.
Lose to Notre Dame
Going to South Bend on December
26 Stanford dropped her third game
of the trip to Notre Dame, 29-19.
The Cards played good defensive
ball but could not make their long
shots connect. Bryan Moore led the
scorers with six points, while Hal
Turner followed with five.
Stanford entered the second half
of the game on the short end of a
10-6 score and were held scoreless
for 14 minutes until Moore made
three successive field goals.
On the following night a tired
Cardinal quintet dropped a close 25-
18 game to Michigan State. Again
without rest the Indians tangled with
Marquette University on December
28 and lost to the Milwaukee team

this game and was followed by
Moore. The former gathered 11
digits and the latter seven.
Trim Nebraska
Traveling to lowa City, Bunn's
men played their fourth game in as
many nights and lost to the Univer
sity of lowa five 38-28. Proving that
a rest would do them good, the local
five played their next game on Jan
uary 2 in Lincoln, where they de
feated the University of Nebraska
35-31.
Moore, playing his usual bang-up
game, scored 12 points. The re
maining double header with Creigh
ton gives the Indians a chance to
bring up their winning column. The
team will be home January 6.

Dairymen have found that cows
which are exceptionally heavy milk
producers often draw on the min
eral matter in their skeletons to such
an extent that their bones break
easily.
