# POLO TEAM LOSES SERIES IN ROGERS CUP COMPETITION
## Oklahoma Four Wins First Two Contests While Cards Take Third 
### Charles Thomas 
Continuing their policy of vacation
contests, a much-improved Stanford
polo four participated in the inaugu
ral games in competition for the
Will Rogers trophy, though the
Cards dropped a close scries to the
strong Oklahoma Military Academy
riders by a of 2 games to 1.
The three contests, played on De
cember 23, 26, and 30, were run off
in Los Angeles. The Will Rogers
trophy, it is hoped, will eventually
become one of* the most coveted
awards in intercollegiate polo, with
Eastern and Western eliminations
planned preceding annual cham
pionships in Los Angeles for the
cup. Last month's single series was
a preliminary "feeler" to determine
public reaction to such a proposed
plan, it was explained.
Oklahoma Wins Opener
Oklahoma won the first game by
a close score of 10 to 8 in a sensa
tional contest which featured a re
juvenated Stanford lineup. The In
dians pushed over four counters in
the third chukker 4 to take a 6-5
lead, but were unable to hold the
Claremont riders, who hail from
Mr. Rogers' home town. Cal Emeis
and Captain Luppe Luppen each
accounted for three goals while Bill
Rogers, son of the famous humorist,
played excellent defensive polo.
Carl Beal was the other Card play
er, and he accounted for two goals
from his back position.
The second contest found the
OklaHomans still too powerful,
though the score was very close at
7 to 5. The same lineup played for
Stanford.
Cards Capture Third
On the 30th, the Indians came back
strong to revenge themselves by de
cisively defeating the Oklahoma out
fit, 5 to 2, in the most thrilling en
counter of the series. Stanford, with
the old lineup of Cal Emeis and
Luppe Luppen alternating at No. 1
position, Bill Rogers at No. 2, Russ
Rasmussen in No. 3, and Bob Ful
lerton playing back, demonstrated
some of the power which made them
mythical Coast champions last sea
son.
Rogers Is High Scorer
Bill Rogers, veteran No. 2, proved
to be one of Stanford's leading play
ers, when he scored three sensational
goals out of the total score of five.
Two men who played their last
games for the Red, and will be sorely
missed from the squad in the future,
Captain Luppe Luppen arid Cal
Emeis, were instrumental in Stan
ford's victory.
The contests were played on Mr.
Rogers' private grounds and at the
Uplifters Field in Los Angeles.
Mounts for both aggregations were
furnished from the Rogers stables.
