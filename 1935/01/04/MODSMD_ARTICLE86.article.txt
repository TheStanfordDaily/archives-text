# STANFORD-TROJAN QUINTET TO OPEN CONFERENCE HERE
## Bunn Men Will Face Last Season Champions In Pavilion Jan. 11-12 
### 
Coach John Bunn's 1935 basketball
forces will make their first local ap
pearance following their ten-game
barnstorming trip with an acid test,
facing the University of Southern
Califox-nia quintet, last year's con
ference champs, in the Encina gym
nasium on Friday and Saturday
nights, January 11 and 12.
Cards Lose Six Games
Card fans have been preparing for
the worst, judging by the reports of
the trip — two wins against six
losses. However, basketball follow
ers have long considered the play
in the Midwest as far superior to the
Coast brand, so the success of the
Cards does not give a fair estima
tion of their chances against Cal,
U.S.C., and U.C.L.A.
The barnstorming trip, according
to Bunn, was designed to give the
Cards the experience necessary for
the Trojan and Bear series. Stan
ford's strenuous schedule against
teams playing an open, fast game is
expected to give them the stamina
necessary to play top-speed through
the conference contests.
Troy Team to Beat
Sam Barry's Trojans are now re
garded as the team to beat. With
all - conference Lee Guttero still
tallying heavily from the pivot po
sition, and a new' high-scoring for
ward in Jack Hupp, S.C. will again
be hard to beat. The Trojans have
also been barnstorming, up the coast
as far as Washington.
Cal meanwhile has been having
only mediocre success with its
post - conference games. The Bears
dropped two to Santa Clara, evi
dently bothered by a considerably
altered line-up. The return of Cap
tain Dave Meek following the foot
ball trip to Hawaii is counted on to
boost Cal's scoring column.
