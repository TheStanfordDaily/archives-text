TAMING PHILIPPINE HEAD
HUNTERS, by Felix M. Keesing
and Marie Keesing. With an in
troduction by Theodore Roosevelt.
Stanford University Press. (Dec.)
1934, 228 pages.
This volume was written by Dr.
and Mrs. Keesing under the aus
pices of the Institute of Pacific Re
lations, and deals with those peoples
inhabiting the little known region of
northern Luzon.
The Philippines were under Span
ish domination for three centuries.
Then came the three decades of
American overlordship. The result
was a civilization more western than
Oriental. There were portions of
the islands—strongholds of barbar
ism—into which white man's ways
never penetrated. North Luzon was
one of the.se.
These folk that inhabit the moun
tain fastnesses of northern Luzon
number a quarter of a million. They
are so-called "non-Christian" peo
ples—Malayan, Indonesian, and pig
my stocks.
The customs, manners, and future
outlook of these peoples are dwelt
upon in the pages of this volume,
especially their relation to twentieth
century civilization. The best hope
held for these people in the belief
of Theodore Roosevelt, who served
as governor general of the islands
for a term, is assimilation by the
Christian population.
To the general reader, the book
offers especial interest from the eth
nic content, and also the administra
tive problem of governing a pagan
minority amid a common Filipino
Christian culture. —Larson
MODERN SAMOA, by Felix M.
Keesing. Stanford University
Press. (Dec.) 1934, 506 pages.
Dr. Keesing of the research staff
of the Institute of Pacific Relations
has made a thoroughgoing study of
the problem of racial and cultural
conflicts in the Samoan Islands.
This volume would well be worth
reading by any student interested in
sociology, government, or ethnology.
The affairs of western Samoa and
American Samoa are discussed from
practically every angle in an illu
minating manner.
The author spent eight months in
the Samoan Islands gathering mate
rials for this volume. lie is a recog
nized authority in Polynesian an
thropology.
Although the Samoan Islands are

but one of many island groups of the !
Far Pacific, they have been a bone 1
of contention among western na
tions for a hundred years. Many a |
diplomatic storm has raged about
them, due to their strategic lock- j
tion.
Keesing devotes nearly a hundred j
pages to a review of their troubled ;
political history. The remainder 01
the book is concerned with the vex
ing questions which confront the j
white overlords of the from
the standpoint of administration. j
Native government, land owner- !
ship, contract labor, health, religion, :
and education in the Samoas are a'l |
considered.
The author reaches the conclusion
that out of the present racial hodge
podge a people of fused blood will
result, and their life will strike "some
balance between the island environ
mental-cultural conditions and the
world intellectual and social milieu. 1 ' |

was a civilization more western than
Oriental. There were portions of
the islands—strongholds of barbar
ism—into which white man's ways
never penetrated. North Luzon was
one of the.se.
These folk that inhabit the moun
tain fastnesses of northern Luzon
number a quarter of a million. They
are so-called "non-Christian" peo
ples—Malayan, Indonesian, and pig
my stocks.
The customs, manners, and future
outlook of these peoples are dwelt
upon in the pages of this volume,
especially their relation to twentieth
century civilization. The best hope
held for these people in the belief
of Theodore Roosevelt, who served
as governor general of the islands
for a term, is assimilation by the
Christian population.
To the general reader, the book
offers especial interest from the eth
nic content, and also the administra
tive problem of governing a pagan
minority amid a common Filipino
Christian culture. —Larson

Keesing. Stanford University
Press. (Dec.) 1934, 506 pages.
Dr. Keesing of the research staff
of the Institute of Pacific Relations
has made a thoroughgoing study of
the problem of racial and cultural
conflicts in the Samoan Islands.
This volume would well be worth
reading by any student interested in

The affairs of western Samoa and
American Samoa are discussed from
practically every angle in an illu
minating manner.
The author spent eight months in
the Samoan Islands gathering mate
rials for this volume. lie is a recog
nized authority in Polynesian an
thropology.
Although the Samoan Islands are

but one of many island groups of the !
Far Pacific, they have been a bone 1
of contention among western na
tions for a hundred years. Many a |
diplomatic storm has raged about
them, due to their strategic lock- j
tion.
Keesing devotes nearly a hundred j
pages to a review of their troubled ;
political history. The remainder 01
the book is concerned with the vex
ing questions which confront the j
white overlords of the from
the standpoint of administration. j
Native government, land owner- !
ship, contract labor, health, religion, :
and education in the Samoas are a'l |
considered.
The author reaches the conclusion
that out of the present racial hodge
podge a people of fused blood will
result, and their life will strike "some
balance between the island environ
mental-cultural conditions and the
world intellectual and social milieu. 1 ' |
