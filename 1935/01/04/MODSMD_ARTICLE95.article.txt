## 
### 
Invitations for winter rushing, i
which begins tomorrow at noon,
were issued to freshmen and un
affiliated transfer women last night
by members of Panhellenic follow
ing a Panhellenic tea held at 4
o'clock in Ihe Women's Clubhouse
for all women registering at Stan
ford for the first time this quarter.
A new .system of rushing is being 1
inaugurated this year by the sorori
ties, featuring the division of the
rush period into three consecutive
parts with the elimination of all oral j
invitations.
Rushing will take place between

i January 5 and January 11, inclusive,
bidding taking place Saturday, Jan
uary 12. Wednesday, January 9, will
be a day of silence and no invitations
will be for that day.
The first division of rushing dates
v/ill consist of luncheon and dinner
Saturday, January 5, and dinner at
noon Sunday, January G. The second
division will consist of dinner Mon
day, January 7. and luncheon and
dinner Tuesday, January 8. Written
invitations will be given out follow
! ing each of these divisions.
The final period of rushing, which
follows a day of silence, Wednesday.
January 0, will consist of dinner
dates for Thursday. January 10, and
Friday, January 11. Bidding will
take place the next dav.
1 The advantage of this new system
! of issuing invitations is the elimina
tion of ail personal and telephoned
. requests to rushees. These will be
considered invalid, and any sorority
wishing to get in touch with a
rushee after the written invitations
have gone out must do so through
her sponsor.
