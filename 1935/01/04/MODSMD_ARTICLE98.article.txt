# Graft Exposed In L.A. County By Grand Jury
## Probe Reveals Corruption Of Public Money 
### 
| LOS ANGELES, Jan. 3 (/P).—The
Los Angeles county grand jury to
■ day filed its report with Superior
i Judge Fletcher Bowron, saying its
investigations "reveal a shocking
condition of corruption in local
| government generally."
It also reported that facts indi
cate "many hundreds of thousands
j of dollars of public money are be
ing wasted each year in petty graft,
favoritism and the purchase of po
| litical preferment."
Record Data
The report did not mention any
department of government by name
1 but said the grand jury would file
| with the court detailed data un
i covered in the investigation,
j Among things the report charged
| were: i
I That corruption has permeated the
law enforcement agencies as well as
the administrative departments and
i that "spheres of influence" have been
created in these agencies by machine
' politicians to protect the politicians
against prosecution for bribery.
Attack Lobbyists
That work of honest employees of
! governmental agencies is nullified
by activities of lobbyists engaged in
"purchasing from public officials
and employees special favors and
j special positions and privileged con
; tracts for the interests they represent
! at the expense of the taxpayers.
That although the grand jury is
confined by law to investigation of
county officials and city boards of
education, graft conditions in city
governments are as bad if not worse
than in the county government.
Overpay Favorites
The report also said one county
department "overpaid a single fa
vored company for a single commod
ity more than $30,000 in a period of
17 months." This was given as an
instance of the causes of greatly in
creased costs of government.
The grand jury reported it had
been unable to fix criminal respon-
I sibility definitely in the majority of
j cases it has examined. Prosecution
j for bribery, it was said, is hampered
i by the three-year statute of limi
tations. This said the re
-1 port, expires frequently while public
officials are still in office and able
I to cover up discrepancies.
Much space was devoted in the
report to trenchant attacks on ma
chine politicians, professional lobby
i ists and campaign contributions.
