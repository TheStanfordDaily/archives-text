NEW YORK, Janfl 3 (/?!,
Baer might just as well disabuse
himself now of the idea iha.
he's going to feature the 1035 fight
picture with an attempt to knock
out two legitimate heavyweight title
challengers in one night.
Cocky Mr. James J. Johnston of i
Madison Square Garden, the or
ganization that holds the contract
under which Baer will fight some
one in June actually shudders at
the thought of such a colossal waste
of the prize ring's natural resources, i
"Christmas," shouts Jimmy. "It
takes a whole year to build up one
challenger. And he wants to take
two of them—Steve Hamas and Art
Lasky—the same night on ihe same
card for the price of one admission.
Well, he won't do it."
So that, apparently, brings to a j
sudden ending one of the most fan
tastic prospects of a new year in

j which the boxing picture is likely
; to turn out just a reprint of the
1934 panorama, with slight back
ground changes.
One heavyweight challenger will
be culled from the list of Hamas,
I nsky, Max Schmeling and Primo
l;:i: ip. with an even chance that
the lialir.n mastiff will again draw
(he Garden Bowl invitation and
take another first class licking. Per
sonally, Jol i: rn f ivoi- Lasky's
j chances, and he .v; innks he m\;ht
lick Baer.
One at a Tinn
"Why, that Baer!" he fun: s "H •
knocked out Levinsky in two rou'V.
He had to be lucky to do that after
fighting him 30 previous rounds and
j never getting him off his feet. So
1 now he wants to fight everyone all
at once. If Baer's such a terriffic
puncher, why did Camera get up 11
times? Why did Camera finish on
his feet? Why, if this Baer is such
a murderer, couldn't he get enough
power into one punch to keep a big
guy down 10 seconds?"
Johnston's conversation goes on

that w: y ft r hours. It takes diplo
ni o witch him to the rest of |
the l!/'o5 resicc!s.
"This Joe L i':. ho bir* Detroit
Negro who knock rd over Lee
Ramage and Charley '' ei;\ '-i?r
be the sensation of 1935 that Baer
was in 1934," Jimmy declares.
Louis knocks out Patsy Perroni in
Detroit Friday night, then he rates
j l ight up there with the rest of the I
| challengers.
