# APPROVE RAISE IN TUITION FOR THEATER FUND
## Response to Daily Editorial Shows Approval Of Upping in Fee 5-1 SUPPORT IS SHOWN Students Say Completion By Next Fall Unnecessary 
### 
That Stanford students should
continue to pay the dollar toward
the theatre fund was the almost
unanimous opinion of students con
tacted yesterday for statements in
response to Friday's Daily editorial.
These students consider that the
theatre will definitely be erected and
that the dollar added to the tuition
will bring the construction time
nearer.
The editorial stated that stu
dents should not continue to pay
the money unless it could he as
sured that the theatre would he
ready hy autumn quarter of this
next year. Campus opinion on the
subject is being sought
Following are the statements of
the students:
Helen Ray, A.S.S.U. vice-presi
dent: "Definite student effort will
prove our interest in desiring to have
a new theatre and will encourage
the administration and outside sup
port. The students must make the
first move."
Ben Cave, student Manager:
"The University is sincere in its
promise that we will get a new
theatre. We are spending our dol
lars with a definite end in view,
and the sooner the money for the
theatre is assured, the sooner the
building will be erected."
Gordon Steedman, member of the
theatre committee: "We should go
on paying the dollar, for the new
theatre is not a possibility, it is an
actuality. Present plans are for con
struction to start about June. The
committee is working on plans by
which more money will be assured
and a more satisfactory construc
tion plan will be achieved before
actual work is begun. That the the
atre will be ready by the beginning
of next autumn quarter is of second
ary importance. We must have the
best theatre possible—and we must
not sacrifice thorough consideration
to hasten construction."
Mary Ann Crary: "It is vitally
necessary to try to raise the mon
ey, whether we build a new theatre
or remodel the old one. The dra
matics department at Stanford must
be built up."
Annalee Whitmore, member of
the theatre committee: "Of course
we should pay the dollar! Even if
construction doesn't begin for a
year, the theatre is sure to he
built eventually—the committee is
sure of that. All the support that
students can possibly give is abso
lutely necessary."
John Mottram: "It is only right
that the student body members
know where the money is going and
when the construction will begin."
His response was emphatically in
favor of the editorial.
