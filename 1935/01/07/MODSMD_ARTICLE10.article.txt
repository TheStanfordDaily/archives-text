# Lake Prospects Excellent For Love, Fish, Tadpoles

### HESTER McMASTERS 
Courageous souls who court while
canoeing will probably find them
selves able to indulge in this ro
mantic outdoor sport to their heart's
content this year if the moisture from
heaven, otherwise known as rain,
falls in the proportions needed to fill
Lagunita Lake,
With three feet of water already
in the lake, and more running in, all
that is necessary is a steady down
pour over a continuous period to
assure plenty of water for canoers,
tadpoles, fish and other amphibians,
says James W. McDonnell, civil and
electrical engineer at the Corpora
tion Yard.
McDonnell explained that the

water for the lake is the overflow
from Felt and Searsville lakes and
is diverted into Lagunita by means
of San Francisquito Creek, so that a
continuous rain is needed to keep the
creek full and running. The amount
of rainfall is equal to that of last
i year at this time with good prospects
; of more.
The rumor that the lake would not
be allowed to fill this year because
| of the danger of it undermining the
foundations of the new dormitory,
Lagunita Court, was spiked by As
' sistant Comptroller Alfred L. Trow
bridge. Trowbridge said that the
j story was unfounded because no de
terminations had been made about
the matter. â€¢
