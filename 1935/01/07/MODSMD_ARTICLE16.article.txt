# BUDGET OUTLOOK POOH FOR 1935
## Dr. G. A. Dowrie To Speak Over KGO Tonight 
### 
That the prospect of a balanced
budget before 1937 is slight will be
the opinion given by Dr. Geoi-ge W.
Dowrie in discussing the financial
outlook for 1935 over the Stanford j
Radio Hour on KGO at 8 o'clock to- i
flight.
Dr. Dowrie, professor of finance in
the Graduate School of Business, is
considered an authority on finance,
which he has been teaching since
1913. He sees much improvement in
agriculture, retail trade, personal
service occupations, and industries
which cater to the consumer in 1934
over 1932, when the depression was
at its height.
Progress in the building business
and the making of capital goods
has been disappointingly slow, j
however, and as a result many !
millions are still dependent on j
public work or direct relief.
With the exception of 1918, when |
he- was connected with the Guar- |
anty Trust Company of New York, j
Dr. Dowrie has done research in i
business methods. He received his i
Ph.D. degree in 1913 from the Uni- |
versity of Illinois. He was dean of i
the School of Business of the Uni- j
versity of Minnesota from 1919 to I
1926.
