JACKSONVILLE, Fla., Jan. 6 (/P).
â€” Fifty passengers and 15 members
of the crew were hauled to safety
from bobbing lifeboats today after
the Ward liner Havana smashed into
a reef off the Bahama Islands. One
passenger, Robert Rittenhouse, was
dead when taken from a lifeboat.
Guided by a Coast Guard plane
and spurred on by cracking wire
less calls, the freighter El Oceano
and the United Fruit steamer Peten
pounded through heavy seas to res
cue the occupants of six lifeboats
launched from the Havana which left
New York Thursday for Havana.
The weather, which had been
thick during the tense hours pre
ceding the passengers' rescue, was
clearing up and no immediate fears
were held for the stranded vessel
or her remaining crew.
The rescue of the passengers
routed out of their cabins when the
Havana jarred against Manzanilla
shoals at 4:30 a.m., was effected in
lolling seas about GO miles due east
of Fort Pierce, Fla., at the extreme
northern tip of the Bahamas.
