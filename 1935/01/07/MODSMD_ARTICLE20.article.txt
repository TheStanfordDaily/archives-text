# Sororities Begin Second Period of Rushing Today
## Rushees Allowed To Accept Two Meals at a House; Bidding Saturday 
### 
Second period rushing invitations
were delivered to Roble women and
transfers by Pan-Hellenic represen
tatives last night. These invitations
include dates for dinner tonight,
luncheon tomorrow, and dinner to
morrow night.
In keeping with the new rushing
spirit, the invitations were handed
out in as quiet a manner as possible.
Rushees returned the missives to
their sponsors during the evening,
thus avoiding any personal contact
with the houses, as was the case last
year.
During this second period, a
rushee is allowed to accept two
invitations to a single house. In
the preceding period each sorority
could entertain a rushee only
once.
At dinner tonight and tomorrow
night informal afternoon clothes are
to be worn, while at the luncheon
date Tuesday noon Quad dresses are
in order. Tuesday noon's rushing
period extends from 12:15 until 2
o'clock, half an hour longer than was
formerly allowed.
New Bid System
A preferential bidding system will
be inaugurated by Pan-Hellenic this
year. After the final rushing date
Friday night, each sorority will turn
in two lists of women whom they
wish to pledge, a first list and an
alternative list. Between 9:30 and
10:30 o'clock that same evening,
rushees will go down to the offices of
the directors of the various dormi
tories. They will write their prefer
ences as to the house they wish to
pledge on a card.
A disinterested woman has
been hired to compare the lists
turned in by the sororities and the
cards turned in by the freshmen
on Saturday. She will write down
the decision as to which house
each woman may pledge on a card.
Pledging will take place on Satur
day night. The same disinterested
woman, however, will replace the
customary lawyer. In the director's
office, the rushee will receive the
card on which she will discover the
house she may pledge. As usual,
Cap and Gown alumnae will call for
the pledges and deliver them to the
various houses on the Row.
. Pan-Hellenic has endeavored to
keep rushing as quiet and unexciting
a matter as possible. Prolonged bull
sessions have been discouraged. Each
freshman is urged to make her own
decision, thus avoiding the former
hectic rushing period.
