## 
### 
Tlie first day of registration found
3191 students enrolled for winter
quarter studies, according to a re
port issued from the registrar's
office.
This is a gain of 183 students over
last year's first day registration. An
even greater gain j s expected before
registration closes, since many stu
dents are not expected to return un
til today, having taken advantage of
the additional week-end as part of
their Christmas vacation.
