### 
BERLIN, Jan. 6 (/P). â€” Uncon
firmed reports from unrelated quar
ters in Munich and Berlin, tonight
Sc.id two storm troopers attempted
to shoot Adolph Hitler in the Chan
cellery on the night of December 31,
not harming Hitler, but wounding a
chauffeur.
Another version, likewise un
confirmed, said the chauffeur was
killed. Both reports were prompt

It was noted that Chancellor Hitler
has a new driver for his automobile.
It was said the reputed attempt
against Hitler's life motivated the
