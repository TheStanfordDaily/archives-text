# HEAVY SESSION FACES SENATE, HOUSE GROUPS
## Long, Clark Due To Clash Over Floor Supremacy In Upper House BUDGET TALK AWAITED Differences Seen on Social Security Program 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. G (A 1 ). â€” A
prolonged and heated session of
Congress was foreseen today by
Democratic congressional leaders as
they studied the outlines of the
President's vast legislative program.
Members of both the House and
Senate were awaiting only the read
ing of the President's $8,000,000,009
budget message tomorrow before
starting the verbal fireworks of the
new Congress.
The first clash was scheduled
for the Senate tomorrow, where
Senator Clark (I). Mo.) and Sen
ator Huey P. Long (D., La.) are
to contest for the right to the floor.
Clark planned to open the fight
for a $100,000 appropriation to
enable the Nye committee to con
tinue its munitions investigation.
The "Kingfish" desired to make
some disparaging remarks about
the administration.
The House was in a state of semi
docility for the first day but bonus
advocates, inflationists and 30-hour
week proponents already were rest
less.
Speaker Byrns claims he has all
hut the honus proponents hog-tied
for the remainder of the session
under new rules which make it
difficult for minorities to secure
floor votes. However, inflation and
30-hour week groups in the Sen
ate plan to get legislation through
that branch and send it to the
House.
Despite the harmonious start of
the session, indications point to
much debate and difference of ideas
on the administration's social se
curity program. Already members
of Congress are receiving protests
over Mr. Roosevelt's proposal to
eliminate the dole beginning Feb
ruary 10.
