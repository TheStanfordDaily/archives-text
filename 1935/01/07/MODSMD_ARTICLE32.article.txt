# Honor Code To Stay? Drive Out the Chiselers
## 
### 
"A'o mi permit led aid yiven or received"
placed above one's signature upon an exami
nation paper or other written work, means
that he personally believes in and supports
in lull the Stanford Honor Code.
If there is a man or woman who does not
know what that Honor Code stands for by this
lime, his or her presence is no longer required
on this campus.
The student councils, executive leaders,
Daily editorial writers, and other interested
parties have long labored to lix. the Honor
Code in the individual mind as the one tradi
tion on this campus that cannot be broken.
Hecent days have shown that definite co
operative action must be taken if that element
of Stanford undergraduate life is to be pre
served. That action must be taken now.
Some students have grown very careless
of late in their habits of taking examinations,
in their methods used to procure material for
term papers. Some of the faculty advise refer
ence to old quizes and papers in study for a
given course. They do not advocate taking
copies of these papers to class on examination
day. Nor do they request that fellows "get
together for a smoke" to break up the mo
notony of a four hour examination and, in
cidentally, to talk over a few of the less
comprehensible questions.
Hut others, 100, have been lax. You and I,
and the average Stanford student have not
met the responsibilities that are ours, nor
fulfilled ttie obligations that each individual
owes the Stanford community. Some of us,
during the past three months, have had very
good reason to believe that one or more of
our colleagues have not played fair with the
Stanford Honor Code. There are some who
are known by a few to have raised their aca
demic grades by unfair methods.
It is not easy to report a friend, turn even a
stranger in for possible expulsion from the
I niversity because lie has slipped once into
h:i(l ways. It is far easier to forget the incident,
with the realization that the class average may
be higher and your own grade lower, but that
(rouble might be avoided.
What if 3,000 men and women at Stanford
feel the same way? If you see me cheating
and do not report me are you any better than
your private opinion of me?
Is the man held as "accessory after the fact"
in ;i murder case any more guilty than the
student who sees a vicious situation making
its inroads on the Stanford campus and does
not do his part to forestall the calamity?
If you catch a thief ransacking the room of
your best friend, it is your duty to apprehend
him and see that he is brought to justice. The
underhanded, despicable, two-faced person
who pilfers the very academic standards from
beneath your own two eyes certainly deserves
as just a fate.
Cheaters are chisclers, parasites on good
society, and they are not wanted on the Stan
lord campus. One comes to Stanford to learn,
to profit from the art of seeking knowledge.
To fool others, and oneself with pretense of
knowledge is not achievement. These chisclers
should be sent elsewhere with no waste of
lime.
Once every Stanford student gels this idea
firmly imbedded in his mind very few students
will be forced to leave Stanford for pursuit
of this practice.
Each of us will liike his chance with his
fellows in a fair, proper examination that is
given with equal opportunity to all. That is
the spirit of competition. In the future, the
cheaters, the chisclers, the grade-sucking
parasites shall be eliminated from Stanford
society.
The Daily herewith pledges its full support
to the efforts of Stanford students to maintain
I his standard of fair play, as outlined by the
student councils.
If you detect cheating in your classroom,
report the fact at once. Your information is a
confidence thai will no! be violated. Your
name will never be made public.
Yours will be a constructive contribution
lo the Stanford community.
