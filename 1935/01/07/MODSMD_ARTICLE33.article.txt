# Barbarism on Way Out—Maybe
## 
### 
Thcta Chi. in its animal convention during
the Christinas holidays, took a progressive

and highly desirable step when it passed a
resolution abolishing Hell Week, heretofore
considered an indispensable part of the
mysterious-process by which common mortals
become members of (ireek letter societies.
Such action is not new, however. It has ln»en
taken before and so far seems to be nothing
more than a gesture in the right direction.
Individual chapters persist in continuing the
playful and asinine pranks that usually
characterize initiation periods, despite the
express disapproval of their national organiza
tions.
Hell Week, as most enlightened fraternity
men will themselves admit, is nothing more
than an outdated remnant of the barbarism
that once prevailed in collegiate circles. Can
non lire, arson and other similarly harmless
idiosyncrasies were once favored by univer
sity playboys hut have now faded into the
limbo where Hell Week belongs.
Such national action as Theta Chi has
taken is highly commendable. It needs only
to be put into practice.
