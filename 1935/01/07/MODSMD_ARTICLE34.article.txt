As the new year gets into full swing, many
students will find themselves building plans
for the Inline, plans for pleasure; plans on
landing that job after next June; perhaps,
even plans for the continuance of their edu
cation.
A lot of water is due to slip through the mill
before summer quarter registration day, but
these same foresighted students would do well
to consider the advantages of Stanford's sum
mer quarter session.
Most of the vital courses offered in other
seasons are also a part of the summer quar
ter, and in addition, there is the opportunity
of studying under any number of the twenty
live noted specialists, five of whom are from
foreign countries, who will be guest instruc
tors.
