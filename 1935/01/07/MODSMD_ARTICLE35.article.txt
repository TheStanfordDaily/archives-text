It was profounded hv the late Thomas Alva
Edison in one of his contests to find "the
brightest American hov," and for a time no
one could move in the best of society unless
he or she had a pat answer.

Charles Edison, son of the inventor, has re
vealed that the "right answer" was no answer.
College educators and men of similar high
caliber take time out once in awhile to re

any very concrete evidences of that attitude
in the conduct of the courses.

there was no "right answer," but at that late
hour we never could be quite sure whether
the prof knew it, too. —Michigan Daily.
