### CEDRIC LARSON 
WITH ADAMANTIOS T. POLYZOIDES
Discounting current rumors that the recently mar
ried Duke of Kent and Princess Marina may ascend a
Greek throne, Adamantios T. Polyzoides, expert on
Greek affairs, who visited Stanford Friday evening,
said:
"I don't think there is any serious movement to
restore the monarchy in Greece at this time. If any
thing like this should happen, the deposed dynasty
would probably return rather than a new royal
house being established. If, on the other hand, a
fascist government based on military authority
were set up in Greece, a king might be supported.
The royalists are a minor political faction at pres
ent, and a return to monarchic government seems
to me obviously impalpable."
The Greek publicist pointed out the growing im
portance of his nation: "Greece is now a country of
8,000,000 inhabitants, and occupies 50,000 square miles.
Our coastline is greater than that of France, and our
merchant marine trade has grown steadily since the
end of the war."
Modern Greece was born over a century ago, Poly
zoides stated, when in 1821 patriotic Greeks under the
inspiration of nationalist revival unfurled the banner
of revolution against their Turkish masters, whose
tyranny they had endured four centuries. After heroic
fighting and foreign help, Hellas threw off the alien
yoke of the sultan. Ensuing Greek history is a record
of its determined efforts to preserve and enlarge the
results of its dearly bought independence.
Up to the time of the Great War there were
2,500.000 Greeks vegetating under the obscurity of
Turkish overlor4ship, Polyzoides said. The treaty
•of Neuilly (191!)) afforded Greece the enjoyment of
Allied fruits of victory when it obtained from Bul
garia Macedonia and Thrace, and also fattened
territorially on cessions from its ancient foe, Tur
key. The 2,500.000 Greeks were now under the
aegis of their national flag—they were chiefly
business men, artisans, merchants, and those de
voted to intellectual pursuits. Their compatriots
who had been free a century were more conserva
tive and interested in politics. "I think the blend
of these two cultures has proceeded very satis
factorily since 1919." commented the publicist.
Communism in Greece has been politically sup
pressed. "The Greeks are too individualistic to be
good communists," said Polyzoides. Nonetheless, Greece
is today on good terms with Soviet Russia and a brisk
trade has sprung up between the two countries.
Two problems in the realm of foreign affairs
harass the minds of Greek statesmen. Bulgaria
clamors for an outlet' to the Aegean Sea—"an
Aegean Polish corridor," as Polyzoides phrased it
—which Greece is reluctant to grant. The other
question is one of treatment accorded 200.000
Greeks living in southern Albania.
Chief hopes for future near eastern tranquillity re
pose in recently signed Balkan pacts, is the belief of
Polyzoides. The Balkan confederation has eased ten
sion immeasurably. The four-power treaty of 1933
between Greece, Yugo-Slavia, Rumania, and Turkey
guaranteeing existing frontiers mitigates the traditional
bellicose attitude of these countries toward one another,
and suspicion is gradually being supplanted by amity
and toleration, making the Balkans less of a "powder
keg" each succeeding year.

factorily since 1919." commented the publicist.
Communism in Greece has been politically sup
pressed. "The Greeks are too individualistic to be
good communists," said Polyzoides. Nonetheless, Greece
is today on good terms with Soviet Russia and a brisk
trade has sprung up between the two countries.
Two problems in the realm of foreign affairs
harass the minds of Greek statesmen. Bulgaria
clamors for an outlet' to the Aegean Sea—"an
Aegean Polish corridor," as Polyzoides phrased it
—which Greece is reluctant to grant. The other
question is one of treatment accorded 200.000
Greeks living in southern Albania.
Chief hopes for future near eastern tranquillity re
pose in recently signed Balkan pacts, is the belief of
Polyzoides. The Balkan confederation has eased ten
sion immeasurably. The four-power treaty of 1933
between Greece, Yugo-Slavia, Rumania, and Turkey
guaranteeing existing frontiers mitigates the traditional
bellicose attitude of these countries toward one another,
and suspicion is gradually being supplanted by amity
and toleration, making the Balkans less of a "powder
keg" each succeeding year.
WITH ADAMANTIOS T. POLYZOIDES
Discounting current rumors that the recently mar
ried Duke of Kent and Princess Marina may ascend a
Greek throne, Adamantios T. Polyzoides, expert on
Greek affairs, who visited Stanford Friday evening,
said:
"I don't think there is any serious movement to
restore the monarchy in Greece at this time. If any
thing like this should happen, the deposed dynasty
would probably return rather than a new royal
house being established. If, on the other hand, a
fascist government based on military authority
were set up in Greece, a king might be supported.
The royalists are a minor political faction at pres
ent, and a return to monarchic government seems
to me obviously impalpable."
The Greek publicist pointed out the growing im
portance of his nation: "Greece is now a country of
8,000,000 inhabitants, and occupies 50,000 square miles.
Our coastline is greater than that of France, and our
merchant marine trade has grown steadily since the
end of the war."
Modern Greece was born over a century ago, Poly
zoides stated, when in 1821 patriotic Greeks under the
inspiration of nationalist revival unfurled the banner
of revolution against their Turkish masters, whose
tyranny they had endured four centuries. After heroic
fighting and foreign help, Hellas threw off the alien
yoke of the sultan. Ensuing Greek history is a record
of its determined efforts to preserve and enlarge the
results of its dearly bought independence.
Up to the time of the Great War there were
2,500.000 Greeks vegetating under the obscurity of
Turkish overlor4ship, Polyzoides said. The treaty
•of Neuilly (191!)) afforded Greece the enjoyment of
Allied fruits of victory when it obtained from Bul
garia Macedonia and Thrace, and also fattened
territorially on cessions from its ancient foe, Tur
key. The 2,500.000 Greeks were now under the
aegis of their national flag—they were chiefly
business men, artisans, merchants, and those de
voted to intellectual pursuits. Their compatriots
who had been free a century were more conserva
tive and interested in politics. "I think the blend
of these two cultures has proceeded very satis
factorily since 1919." commented the publicist.
