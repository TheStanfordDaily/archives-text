# BULL SESSION
## PROPAGANDA AND PROFITS 
### 
As today's Campus Opinion indi
cates, some people were a trifle irked
at the flood of propaganda which
drowned poor Mr. Sinclair last
November.
Mi - . Sinclair, who in normal life
is a peace-loving man and a milk
drinker, overnight became the Big
Bad Wolf of California politics —
wallowing in the blood of capital
ists, and thoroughly frightening
about a million and a half voters.
The flames of Epic roared for a time,
and then were reduced to a small
sputter beneath the waves of Re
publican and Democratic attack.
But that was not all. The Campus
Opinioner is further worried that
the crimson tide of propaganda con
tinues. Like Alabama's offensive,
the tide of propaganda is ever pres
ent on land and on the air.
Why should the Campus Opinioner
be outraged? Is it because he was
on the losing side? If so, that is
unfortunate. Is it because he ob
jects to freedom of the press? Prob
ably not. Is it because he mistakes
the purpose of journalism? Prob
ably so!
In America, we are quite ready to
admit that the Communist press,
and the Fascist press, and the Nazi
press are purposive organs for the
dissemination of half-truths and un
truths. We know that they do not
print the truth, the whole truth, so
help them! Dominated by a rigid
governmental censorship, the ma

jority of Continental journalists do
not print news, but preach a phi
losophy. The philosophy they preach
is determined by Stalin, Mussolini,
Hitler, and a half-dozen lesser lights.
In America the press is "free." It
is not avowedly and openly dedi
cated to any single, detailed plan of
anything. The columns of each pa
per are filled, not with the dictated
"news" of a governmental dictator
ship, but with the dictated "news"
of the publisher. Thus the
press, while it does not have to
prirjt government colored stories,
must print not the facts, but the
"news" as it is seen through the
eyes of Hearst, McCormick, Chand
ler, Scripps, Howard, etc.
The individual life-philosophies of
these men, thank God, do differ—and
so their papers are somewhat dif
ferent. On one point they are all
agreed: a paper exists to pay divi
dends. Thus a paper which prints
the truth about advertisers does not
pay. Hence, not the truth but the
"news" is printed about advertisers.
Thus a paper which prints the whole
truth about Upton Sinclair does not
receive the proper "support." Hence,
last November's pleasant spectacle.
And thus it goes on.
If one accepts the premise that a
newspaper is a business and not a
profession, there can be very little
condemnation of printed propaganda.
The Campus Opinioner must rechart
his gripe.
