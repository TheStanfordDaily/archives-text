# CAMPUS OPINION
## DECRIES BALLYHOO

The Editor, Sir:
We had hoped that with the suc
cessful (?) termination of the re
cent campaign to save our state from
the awful menace of Sinclairism we
would be excused from further
hooey and buncombe. â€¢
But no! Daily we are bombarded
with rot and corruption by the press
of the nation about "radicals," "red
professors," and poor gullible stu
dents who are swallowing in toto
this Communistic propaganda.
Please tell me when a professor's
educational efforts become propo
ganda and why Mr. Hearst's propo
ganda of hate is merely educational.
Yours,
D. O. C.
