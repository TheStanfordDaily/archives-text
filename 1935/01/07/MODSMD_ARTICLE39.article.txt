WASHINGTON, Jan. 6 [A*). â€”
NRA's Consumers' Advisory Board
today recommended a considerable
extension of the government's power
to prevent monopoly. In so doing, it
advised serious consideration of
proposals by the Federal Trade Com
mission to stop concentration of
business in the hands of large cor
porations.
In 1868 the death rate in the slums
of New York was six times greater
than it is today.
