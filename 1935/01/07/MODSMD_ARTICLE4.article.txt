# REHEARSALS OF PLAY OUTLINED
## Newcomers Head Cast Of February Production 
### 
Planned rehearsals, inaugurated
last quarter by Dramatic Director
William Murray Timmons, will also
be used in preparation of "Her Mas
ter's Voice," current production.
Timmons last year mapped out a
complete list of rehearsal dates and
what would be accomplished on each.
The result, he thinks, was economy
of time and a more finished perform
ance.
Lines were learned over vacation
for the February play. For the first
time recently, the entire cast was
chosen before fall finals.
Action Planned
To date, the cast has run over the
entire script, act by act, to get the
general action planned. Later each
scene was rehearsed more pains
takingly, with special emphasis on
characterizations.
A rigid schedule has been mapped
out by Tirnmons. Rehearsals are
held every night of the school week,
besides Tuesday and Saturday af
ternoons. The cast attends faith
fully, remarked Manager Dick Frank,
and has made rapid progress.
Properties and scenery will not be
on hand for several weeks, but by
the time they arrive characteriza
tions will be almost perfected.
Feature Newcomers
Newcomers to Stanford dramatics
are headlined in the cast. Members
of Timmons' acting classes with out
standing ability make their debut in
"Her Master's Voice."
Mary Anne Crary, Bernard Wil
son, Katharine Comrie, David Dev
lin, Annelie Morgan, Harold Kahn,
Jr., and Olive Krehbiel occupy major
roles.
