THEODORE ROOSEVELT AND
THE JAPANESE - AMERICAN
CRISIS, by Thomas A. Bailey.
Stanford University Press, 1934.
Dr. Thomas A. Bailey of the Stan
ford history department offers in his
newly published volume an illumi
nating analysis of the gradual rift ir.
American-Japanese relations which
look place during the Theodore Roo
sevelt administration.
Oriental immigration was the ini
tial reef upon which traditional
American - Japanese amity foun
dered. Then came the San Francisco
school' order of 1906 segregating
oriental school children, which
raised a storm of protest in the Japa
nese press.
Dr. Bailey finds that by the end
of the Theodore Roosevelt admin
istration the golden era in Japanese-
American relations had passed, "and
although men might continue to
speak of the traditional fi iendship
as if nothing had happened the at
titude of the two peoples toward each
other** was no longer the same and
never could be. It was the price that
both Japan and America had to pay
for coming of age." —Larson

Thirty-two oil wells were drilled
in the bed of the Sabine river, once
a naviftable stream, near Glade
water, Texas.

Ninety per cent of the childrer
born in St. Louis last year were t<
peoples on the relief rolls.
