# Hoopsters Prepare For League Opener With U.S.C. Friday
## Indians Will Enter Trojan Series Friday Night As Underdogs 
### 
Coach John Bunn will start his
1935 varsity basketball team in its
final week of practice for Coast Con
ference play this afternoon, follow
ing (he arrival of the hoopsters at 1
o'clock this morning from a barn
storming trip through the Midwest.
The final Indian practice game,
played Friday night, was dropped
when Creighton came back after
its 33-29 defeat of the night before
to trim the Cards in a return game,
31-2fi.
The Cardinal quintet will meet the
University of Southern California
Friday and Saturday nights in the
league's opener, and the three wins
against seven losses during the Mid
west trip will definitely place the
Cards as the underdogs.
. Early Hopes Fade
The underdog position is one fa
miliar to Stanford fives, however,
since the Indians have regularly
•bowed to the Trojans and the Bears
on the hardwood court for the past
half-dozen years or more.
Stanford has found its high hopes
of early fall glimmering as practice
games have brought only mediocre
results. Losses through ineligibil
ity, sickness, and injuries have
hampered showing, though the
strenuous barnstorming trip should
leave the Cards in the best of shape
for league play.
The Trojans, on the other hand,
looked for a slight slump, with
the loss of Julie Bescoes and oth
ers, but their December perform
ances leaves them easily resting as
favorite for the conference title
again. The advantage that the
Trojans will carry into the series
with them can be estimated by
comparative scores: San Jose State
33, Stanford 25; U.S.C. 42, San
Jose State, 24, with the Trojans
playing a month later in the sea
son.
Ace of the Trojan attack again
will be Lee "Rubberlegs" Gutterro,
all-conference center. Talk of Gut
tero's slump was dispelled when the
lanky center came through the S.C.
barnstorming trip with a record of
having scored 99 points in the eight
games.
S.C. Trims Huskies
Other high scorer was Ernie Hol
brook, veteran forward, with Jack
Hupp, forward, tallying 31, and Cap
tain '"Barking Joe'' Kelly scoring 22
at guard.
In their trip the Trojans won but
five out of eight games, scoring 269
points against their opponents 243.
However, this apparently mediocre
record will be seen in a different
light when it is realized that the
Trojans met all comers, including the
best of the semi-pro teams on the
Coast, and that they defeated Wash
ington University, last year's Coast
champs, by a decisive 40-24 margin.
U.S.C.'s other wins were over the
Olympic Club, Young Men's Insti
tute, Santa Clara, and San Jose
SUtte, while they lost to the Uni
versal pictures, Hutchinson Renos,
and the first Washington game.

tero's slump was dispelled when the
lanky center came through the S.C.
barnstorming trip with a record of
having scored 99 points in the eight
games.
S.C. Trims Huskies
Other high scorer was Ernie Hol
brook, veteran forward, with Jack
Hupp, forward, tallying 31, and Cap
tain '"Barking Joe'' Kelly scoring 22
at guard.
In their trip the Trojans won but
five out of eight games, scoring 269
points against their opponents 243.
However, this apparently mediocre
record will be seen in a different
light when it is realized that the
Trojans met all comers, including the
best of the semi-pro teams on the
Coast, and that they defeated Wash
ington University, last year's Coast
champs, by a decisive 40-24 margin.
U.S.C.'s other wins were over the
Olympic Club, Young Men's Insti
tute, Santa Clara, and San Jose
SUtte, while they lost to the Uni
versal pictures, Hutchinson Renos,
and the first Washington game.
Coach John Bunn will start his
1935 varsity basketball team in its
final week of practice for Coast Con
ference play this afternoon, follow
ing (he arrival of the hoopsters at 1
o'clock this morning from a barn
storming trip through the Midwest.
The final Indian practice game,
played Friday night, was dropped
when Creighton came back after
its 33-29 defeat of the night before
to trim the Cards in a return game,
31-2fi.
The Cardinal quintet will meet the
University of Southern California
Friday and Saturday nights in the
league's opener, and the three wins
against seven losses during the Mid
west trip will definitely place the
Cards as the underdogs.
. Early Hopes Fade
The underdog position is one fa
miliar to Stanford fives, however,
since the Indians have regularly
•bowed to the Trojans and the Bears
on the hardwood court for the past
half-dozen years or more.
Stanford has found its high hopes
of early fall glimmering as practice
games have brought only mediocre
results. Losses through ineligibil
ity, sickness, and injuries have
hampered showing, though the
strenuous barnstorming trip should
leave the Cards in the best of shape
for league play.
The Trojans, on the other hand,
looked for a slight slump, with
the loss of Julie Bescoes and oth
ers, but their December perform
ances leaves them easily resting as
favorite for the conference title
again. The advantage that the
Trojans will carry into the series
with them can be estimated by
comparative scores: San Jose State
33, Stanford 25; U.S.C. 42, San
Jose State, 24, with the Trojans
playing a month later in the sea
son.
Ace of the Trojan attack again
will be Lee "Rubberlegs" Gutterro,
