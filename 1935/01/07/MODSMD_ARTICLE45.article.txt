# Frosh Quintet Defeats Menlo J.C., Paly High
## Luisette, Cardinal Forward, Stars in Both Tilts 
### 
Coach Jimmie Bradshaw's crew of
frosh basket bailers emerged victo
rious twice during the past week
end, downing a strong Paly High
quintet, 37-15, Friday evening and
then taking the court Saturday night
to defeat Menlo J.C., 40-25.
In both contests Hank Luisette,
stellar Cardinal forward, was the
man of the evening tallying eight
floor shots and one free throw
against Paly and repeating that rec
ord in the J.C. game. In the latter
tussle he was hampered by a bad
ankle, injured late in Friday night's
affair.
Take Early Lead
Starting out slowly against the
prep school five, the local hoopmen
stepped into the lead in the first
quarter, ended the half leading 24-12,
and then continued to build up their
lead during the final periods of play.
Many of the first stringers had taken
the bench when the final gun
sounded.
Saturday evening saw the Stan-»
ford ba£>e quintet make an even bet
ter showing against a fast but small
J.C. five.
Reserves Weak
At the end of the half the Cards
held a 16-11 lead, building it to a
34-15 score about 10 minutes before
the finish gun. At this time Brad
shaw replaced most of his first team
and the reserves found it a difficult
job to withstand the onslaughts of
the Menlo cagers who managed to
take command of the game for the
final period.
Clai-ence Maurer, substitute for
ward for Dick Lyons, who is laid up
with the flu, showed remarkably
well, along with Bob Zonne, center,
Nelly Heath, guard, and Byron I
Forderhase, center and guard.
