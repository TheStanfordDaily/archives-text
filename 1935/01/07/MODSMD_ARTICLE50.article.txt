Stanford sportsmanship received
a major test at last Tuesday's Rose
Bowl game, and it came out in the
Indians' favor.
After the Big Game, which Stan
ford undisputedly won, 9 to 7, al
though the margin was disappoint
ing to more optimistic Stanford fans,
there were many squawks set up
on the farm concerning various fac
tors of the game. Many of these
were justified, but the moaning did
sound like "sour grapes" to outsid
ers, and these non-partisans did
much "yaa-yaaing" at the Stanford
powerhouse "that almost got beaten."
Then came Alabama and trimmed
the Redskins, 29 to 13, with a sensa
tional passing show, and it was
feared sopie of the moaning would
be set up again. But there was not
a Stanford student who claimed any
thing other than that the game was
the best seen during the entire sea
son.
Everyone who committed himself
at all was loud in his praises of the
Alabama offense, and none went
farther than to say Stanford could
have won with better breaks.
So it seems relations between
Stanford and Alabama are on as
high a plane as any athletic rela
tions can be between two schools.
All of which means that in case
the two arc tops in their sections
next fall, a rematching in the
Rose Bowl would be the ideal
drawing card.
Not that it wasn't this year. The
stadium was a complete sell-out; but
next year, with that kind of match,
seats could be sold for a much
higher price and the Bowl would
again be packed.
