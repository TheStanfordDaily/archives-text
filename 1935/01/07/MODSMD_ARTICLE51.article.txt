# DEFEAT WON'T KILL NEXT YEAR'S CHANCES
## 
### 
There has been much talk to the
effect that Stanford has played her
last Rose Bowl game for many years.
Two defeats in a row, it has been
pointed out, may be enough to turn
the Coast Conference officials
against choosing the Indians for a
third successive year, even if they
go through the 1035 season unde
feated.
But other campus comment dis
pells this idea. What team would be
chosen, for example, if the con
ference season ends as it did this
year? Would it be California with
three defeats, or Washington with a
24 to 0 defeat and a tie, or Wash
ington State with three defeats and

a tie? All of these sound rather
ridiculous.
Coach Tiny Thornhill remarked
yesterday: "Our being beaten
won't keep us from Rose Bowl
competition again next year. Of
course we have to win every game,
or at least be above every other
conference team."
In case of a tie, or near tie, in the
conference standings, it is almost
certain that the committee would
give the chance to some other school.
But the conference is also thinking
in terms of drawing powers, and
Stanford did show herself to be a
distinct customer-drawing team.
