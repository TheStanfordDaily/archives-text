# STANFORD VS. ALABAMA IN 1936, MAYBE
## 
### 
In reference to a possible repeti
tion of Stanford vs. Alabama in the
1936 Pasadena game, Thornhill re
marked, "If the two teams are the
best in their sections, a Stanford-
Alabama contest would be the best
drawing card possible next year."
He added: "We have to win every
game, and the rest is up to Ala
bama."
The game has been compared
to Stanford's 24 to 0 victory over
Washington. Both were a case of
the better team winning, but with
a bigger score than was entirely
just in showing the margin be
tween the two. Stanford can now
sympathize with the feeling of
Jimmy Phelan on November II)
after his best Washington team
had found a passing attack handed
back as a boomerang.
Bones Hamilton, Stanford's Rose
Bowl Captain, said "In the Wash
ington game we got the breaks on a
couple of passes. The Huskies could
have been as hot as Alabama and
won the game 24 to 0, but we got
the breaks. Our defense was as
good against Alabama as it has been
all season, but they had a fellow
who could throw the ball where it
was supposed to be thrown."
Bones gave much credit to the
Tide passing attack, but believed
the southerners "not superior to
Stanford in any other way."
