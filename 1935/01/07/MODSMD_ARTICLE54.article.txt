# FRANCE AND ITALY SIGN NEW FREEDOM PACT FOR AUSTRIA
## 
### 
ROME, Jan. G (/P).—Premier Mus
solini of Italy and Pierre Laval, for
eign minister of France, today
leached agreement on a joint decla
ration with regard to Austrian in
dependence and a five or six-power
pact of noninterference, but the
matter regarding colonial conces
sions between France and Italy still
was not settled.
With agreement reached on the
first two points during a three-and
a-half hour conversation between
Laval and Mussolini in the morning
experts of the two nations worked
all afternoon on the third part of
the program — what concessions
Fiance will make for the benefit of
Italian colonies in Africa, involving
a separate pact strictly between
themselves.
The Premier and his French
visitor will have another talk to
morrow morning, a government
spokesman said.
The spokesman denied statements
published abroad yesterday saying
the two foreign ministers have
reached complete accord. The long
talk they had today proved they
had not been in agreement yester
day, he pointed out.
