# BIG WITNESSES TO BE CALLED IN LINDY CASE
## State Will Summon Condon For First Solid Blow Against Hauptmann 
### 
FLEMINGTON, N.J., Jan. 6 (/P).—
The sparring over, the State will take
off its gloves this week and slug bare
fists at Bruno Hauptmann's defense
to charges of baby murder.
Dr. John F. Condon, the 73-y<*ar
old Bronx schoolmaster, who found
himself a principal in the negotia
tions to ransom the Charles A.
Lindberghs' stolen baby, is depended
upon to strike the first solid blow.
Will Support Colonel
Early this week, perhaps by Tues
day, Dr. Condon is to take the stand
in the crowded, close court-room,
and say—as did Colonel Lindbergh
last week:
"The man to whom the $50,000
ransom money was paid was
Hauptmann."
The defense, hoping to counter
act the effect of this testimony, will
slrike back with the charge that
four persons actually kidnaped the
baby and that Hauptman was not
one of them.
Four Kidnapers
Edward J. Reilly, chief defense
counsel, said he would name the
four, probably Thursday.
When court reconvenes tomorrow
morning in Hauptmann's trial for
the baby's murder, the Stale is ex
pected to call as one of its first
witnesses Betty Gow, the Scottish
nurse, who put the Lindbergh baby
to sleep in his crib at Hopewell on
the night of March 1, 19.32. Her
testimony, it is believed, will be
substantially the same as that of
Mrs. Anne Morrow Lindbergh, the
baby's mother.
Visits Accused
Dr. Condon came to Flemington
shortly after Hauptmann was
brought here from the Bronx and
visited the carpenter in the County
Jail. He talked to him in his cell,
using as far as he was able the
same language he used when he sat
with the mysterious "John" for
more than an hour in Woodlawn
Cemetery, the Bronx.
