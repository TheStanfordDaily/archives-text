# ASK SORORITIES TO STAY INSIDE ADVISED QUOTA
## Authorities Warn Houses To Pledge Specified Numbers Only MORE RUSHING TODAY Rushees Drenched by Rain As Cars Barred 
### 
While bewildered freshmen wom
en and transfers paddled home in the
rain from rushing last night, rumor
spread over the campus that some of
the sororities plan to exceed the
recommended quota of pledges.
Authorities refused to divulge the
exact number of pledges allotted to
each house. These figures have been
arrived at after each sorority has
reviewed its own situation in regard
to house capacity and number of
members who will remain in the
house next year. They further
stated that the quota is to be con
sidered not as a prohibition, but as
a I'ecommendation.
In explanation of the situation,
Pan-Hellenic President Margaret
Taylor said last night that, although
the quota recommended is not a
ruling, any departure from the set
quota on the part of a sorority will
be considered as "not co-operating"
by the University.
Luncheon and dinner dates to
day conclude the second rushing pe
riod. Wednesday will be the custo
mary day of silence. Third period in
vitations will be delivered on Wed
nesday, to be returned to the spon
sors by 6:15 o'clock Wednesday
night. These invitations are for din
ner dates both Thursday and Friday
nights.
Rain during the rushing period
further inconvenienced rushees this
year. In former years rushees were
delivered to their respective dormi
tory doors in automobiles by sorority
women. This year rushees must
fend for themselves after they leave
the sorority portals.
Rumor also has it that one house
on the Row has taken to wearing red
hair ribbons and that a group of
freshmen are also following suit,
with official denial by Pan-Hellenic
chiefs immediately upon query last
night.
