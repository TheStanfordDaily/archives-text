# NURSE SHAKEN FROM GRILLING IN LINDY TRIAL
## Prosecution Shows Ladder After Many Protests From Defense 
### 
FLEMINGTON, N.J., Jan. 7'(A*).â€”
Betty Gow, pert Scotch nurse from
whose care the Lindbergh baby was
stolen and slain, faced a three-hour
fire of defense questions today and
later collapsed, tearful and shaken,
in the courthouse where Bruno
Richard Hauptmann is on trial for
his life.
On the witness stand her voice
was calm and even as she answered
the searching queries of Edward J.
Reilly. She kept her composure
bravely when the chief of Haupt
mann's defense steadily pursued his
effort to show the crime was the
work of an "inside" gang of four.
Examines Clothes
Again the pretty nursemaid who
came back from Scotland to testify,
felt the tiny garments the child had
worn when she put him to sleep in
his crib at Hopewell. Again she
saw and touched the flannel shirt
she had sewn to protect his chest
against the cold. Again she touched
the thumbguard she put on him.
But in the end the ordeal of di
rect and cross examination was too
great.
Her eyes red from weeping, her
slim figure quivering with emotion,
she was forced to leave the court
room. In an anteroom she collapsed.
Ladder Shown
Later in the ladder down which,
the state contends, Hauptmann car
ried the stolen baby from his nursery
was brought into the courtroom. It
provoked a storm of protests and
was not immediately admitted as
evidence.
Hauptmann, the cold-eyed cai*-
penter, listened intently as witnesses
described the sectioned ladder.
As he left court he turned to a
guard and remarked:
"If I made that ladder, I'd be a
second rate carpenter."
Prosecutoi's will try to prove that
the baby was killed when the lad
der splintered -and broke that blus
tery night of March 1, 1932.
