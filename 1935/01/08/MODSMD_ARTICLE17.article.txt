# Stanford Shaken 5600 Times Since Big Quake
## 
### ROBERT EISENBACH 
Grey-templed alumni who were
tn the Farm back in '06 like to loosen
up and tell of the big shake that
threw roughs and co-eds from their
beds and tumbled the mosaic-fronted
chapel into ruin.
It's one of the more or less tech
nical secrets of local geologists that
since the fatal year, Stanford's
buildings, and students, have undei
gone approximately 5600 shakes,
whether they know it or not.
Instrument on Course
The human body makes an indif
ferent seismograph, but Dr. Sidney
Dean Townley, emeritus professor of
geodesy, who keeps a peeled eye on
(he seismograph located on the 17th
green of the golf course, has figures
to prove his point.
Out where nothing disturbs the
delicate apparatus, save a misplaced
putt, he has found that this particu
lar portion of Mother Earth gives
1.825 twitches per day, or 200 a year.
Most of them, however, are so slight
as to escape human detection.

uary 3 and December 22, Dr. Town- I
j ley's records show. Six quakes, of |
> which only two were felt, were reg- !
1 istercd on December 30. The first |
! and heaviest struck at 5:54 a.m. That
| was the shock that gave Los Angeles j
papers a break.
The campus seismograph recorded j
19 quakes for December last year as
' compared with 11 in December, 1933.
I Students don't have to worry that
the quakes are gaining in number!
and intensity, however. The average
j has remained constant over a period
of years. Dr. Townley says.

threw roughs and co-eds from their
beds and tumbled the mosaic-fronted
chapel into ruin.
It's one of the more or less tech
nical secrets of local geologists that
since the fatal year, Stanford's
buildings, and students, have undei
gone approximately 5600 shakes,
whether they know it or not.
Instrument on Course
The human body makes an indif
ferent seismograph, but Dr. Sidney
Dean Townley, emeritus professor of
geodesy, who keeps a peeled eye on
(he seismograph located on the 17th
green of the golf course, has figures
to prove his point.
Out where nothing disturbs the
delicate apparatus, save a misplaced
putt, he has found that this particu
lar portion of Mother Earth gives
1.825 twitches per day, or 200 a year.
Most of them, however, are so slight
as to escape human detection.

uary 3 and December 22, Dr. Town- I
j ley's records show. Six quakes, of |

papers a break.
The campus seismograph recorded j
19 quakes for December last year as
' compared with 11 in December, 1933.
I Students don't have to worry that
the quakes are gaining in number!
and intensity, however. The average
j has remained constant over a period
of years. Dr. Townley says.
