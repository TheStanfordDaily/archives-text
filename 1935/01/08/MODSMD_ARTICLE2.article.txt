# Budget Sent To Congress
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 7 (/P).â€”Con
gress tonight appeared reconciled
to another unbalanced budget and
ready to appropriate four billion
more dollars for transferring the un
employed from dole to jobs.
This second financial accounting
of the New Deal, read separately to
an expectant Senate and House, al
lowed for the spending of $17,101,-
000,000 in the two-year fiscal period
that ends 18 months hence.
The President's request for $4,-
000,000,000 was coupled with the rec
ommendation that the money be "in
one sum, subject to allocation" by
himself.
Senate and House members split,
however, on the proposal of Presi
dent Roosevelt's annual budget mes
sage today that the chief executive
be given the money in a lump sum
with power to use the money where
and how he might see fit.
