# Prosperity Returning, ----Dowrie
## Slow Financial Advance Predicted Over Air 
### 
Predicting that we shall make fur
ther slow progress out of our long
depression this year, Professor G. W.
Dowrie spoke on the "Outlook for
1935" over station KGO last night
during the Stanford Radio Hour.
Unwilling to predict any certain
path for 1935, he said he was willing
to hazard the prophecy that unless
something unforeseen happens, the
present favorable situation in the
retail field and in the production of
goods for consumers will continue in
a* least the first quarter of 1935.
He said within the last few months
there has been developed a better
understanding between government
and business and a greater willing
ness to co-operate in the war upon
the depression. He predicts only a
modest improvement in business,
with a corresponding moderate fluc
tuation in stock market prices.
Taking a stand between the ex
treme optimists and radical pessi
mists, Professor Dowrie said there
is no serious reason for expecting
either a let-up in the progress we
are making out of the depression or
some grand spurt into prosperity.
In conclusion he prophesied that
progress will neither be swift nor
even during the coming year, but
that unless a great war is precipi
tated or we bankrupt ourselves by
foolish public spending, we shall
have made further progress out of
the depression.
