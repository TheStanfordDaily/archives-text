votes to be thrown out, it was an
nounced tonight. Such demonstra
tions had been forbidden.
SAARBRUECKEN, Jan. 7 (ZP).—
Voting began today in the history
making Saar plebiscite, ordered 15
years ago at Versailles.
Five thousand public employes
cast .their ballots in a "dress rehear
sal" of the mass voting next Sunday.
In effect, it was a vote for or
against Adolf Hitler, just an army
corporal when the powers which won
Ihe World War decreed that the
Saar, after 15 years of supervision by
the League of Nations, should decide
whether to return to Germany, unite
with France, or remain under the
league's guidance.
