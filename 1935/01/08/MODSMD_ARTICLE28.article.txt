# Supreme Court Declares N.R.A. Oil Code Illegal
## Eight Justices Claim Too Much Legislative Authority Given President Roosevelt; Crude Oil Prices Expected To Tumble as Result 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 7 (yT*).—With only one dissent, the Supreme Court
today declared unconstitutional the first important bit of New Deal legis
lation to come before it—the section of the National Industrial Recovery
Act under which the government is attempting to control oil production.

Chief Justice Hughes read the
long opinion, scrapping one of the
vital laws passed during the Roose
velt administration, to an audience
which packed the tiny courtroom
that was once the Senate chamber.
His voice resonant, the Chief
Justice reiterated that Congress
had delegated too much legislative
authority to the President when
it gave him the power to prohibit
the interstate shipment of oil pro
duced in excess of state quotas.
Such excess production has be
i come known as "hot oil."
The decision caused a burst of
I discussion in the capital.
Secretary Ickes asserted that while
the court had declared unconstitu
tional section 9(C) of the NIRA it
"did not rule on the oil code" em
bodied in other parts of the recovery
act.
"We still have the oil code and
will continue to operate," said Ickes.
"We will attempt to regulate 'hot
oil' with every resource we have."
From the Oklahoma oil liclds
came reports that the crude oil
price structure was cxpccted to
crumble within 24 hours under the
decision.
From Senate and House members
came few expressions of surprise.
New Laws Seen
There were predictions that new
legislation would be enacted for oil
control, possibly through State
compacts.
Justice Cardozo was the only
high court members to disagree
with the conclusion of the other
eight that Congress had given
away some of its intrinsic powers.
Although the oil statute was a
part of the national industry re
covery act, other portions of the
law were not challenged in the suit
brought by the Panama Refining
Company and other concerns oper
ating in the flush oilfields of East
Texas.
Consequently, the codes affecting
almost every industry in the United
States stand for a later test, although
some of the chief justice's language
J may not be read with pleasure by
i administration and NRA officials.
