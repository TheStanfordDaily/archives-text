# Merriam vs. the Future; The Public Is Waiting
## 
### 
Today nl Sacramento Frank Finlev Mer
riain, victor in last November's political battle
of the century, will be inducted as governor
of California. The inauguration will be noth
ing more than an empty formality, for ever
since Inst spring Merriam has been acting
governor of California, wrestling with the
problems of statecraft when not occupied with
the problem of getting himself elected.
Now, however, Mr. Merriam will be gov
ernor, not through the death of another but
through the grace of the electorate. It will
be his duty within the next few days to Jay
before the legislature of California that lib
eral program which he so glibly promised
the voters of California last fall when Sinclair
so nearly stampeded them with his own vis
ions of Utopia.
Mr. Merriatn's greatest problem, as he well
knows, will be to increase the state's revenue
to a point where it will more nearly balance
outgo. Various means of accomplishing this
have been put forward, with Merriam's own
idea of a state income lax being the most
popular except in certain loudly vociferous
quarters.
Although these selfish protests, veiled in a
cloud of pious remarks about the welfare of
business, are obviously overdrawn, there may
possibly be some merit to them. The same
objection that was raised against Sinclair's
EPIC plan may legitimately be used against
a state income tax. While desirable nation
ally, an income tax may be undesirable on a
statewide scale for the reason that it may take
or keep money out of the state. Although
there is no danger of business enterprises
picking up and moving, there is a possibility
that wealthy retired gentlemen with vast
sums of money, if there are any now, will be
less likely to spend their declining years in
California.
t'neasy lies the head that wears a crown
and governors are no exception to the rule
as Mr. Merriam is fast learning.
