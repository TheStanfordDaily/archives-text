# Just a Few Rainy Ideas
## 
### 
The rainy season is with lis again; and this
year it seems to give rise to more than the
usual number of hazards and complaints.
Hourly, harassed newsmen are bombarded
with requests, "Why don't you write an edi
torial about the ', (a H & X *ZZZ?" etc.,
etc., etc. These urgent demands are frequent
enough to bear filing under standardized de
partments.
For instance, the mud puddle is omnipo
tent; to listen to the voice of the people, it
often attains vast and dangerous proportions,
and students daily risk their necks and the
sad fate of falling into an uncommonly large
puddle and drowning therein. The adminis
tration is hereby requested to take steps to
ward curing this puddle situation.
lu the same vein we have the auto-driver
splashing - mud -on - pedestrian grievances,
which are deposited in a pigenhole adjacent
to the puddle compartment. Careless auto
isls arc hereby admonished and requested to
treat the parties afoot with care.
This season by way of variety we have the
satisfaction of listening to an original squawk.
II appears that some tool is guilty of parking
his car in the walk connecting Hrantier ttnd
Tovon Halls; the residents whereof must ac
cordingly scramble out in the wet and dis
agreeable shrubbery instead of using the path
as God and the administration intended. Said
tool is hereby politely asked to discontinue
Ibis practice.
Fairly vital is the current gripe about the
traffic control light al Fl Camilla Meal and
Palm Drive. II has been dead for several days
and before the bureaucrats gel around to re
pairing it, a formidable pile of lorn fenders
and broken gl.lss will probably accumulate at
the side of the road. The authorities in
charge, whoever I hey may be, are hereby rep
rimanded. Graciously, of course.

Well, we heard our duty, and spoke our
piece. It won't do any good, but at least we
wrote the "editorial ahout the X ', (n li
& x *zzzr
