# VIEWING THE NEWS
## WITH THOMAS S. BARCLAY 
### CEDRIC LARSON 
As representatives and senators again begin the
great annual Washington show, front pages throughout
the world are graced with all manner of stories con
cerned with congressional activities and people in all
walks of life in the United States are watching eagerly
to see what will be the behavior of the overwhelming
Democratic majority.
Will Democratic ranks in this seventy-fourth Con
gress unite under powerful leadership to steamroller
the opposition? Will it split into factions, proving too
uncontrollable for Roosevelt to manage? Or will it
become purely a rubber-stamp for administration
measures? These and many other questions, the an
swers to which are as yet problematical, arise in the
minds of Americans.
Dr. Thomas S. Barclay of the political science de
partment, in viewing the situation surrounding the
new Congress, observes:
"Democratic majorities in both houses are far
too large for effective party government. They
may tend to develop into blocs and factions, while
the Republican minority is not sufficiently numer
ous to supply the very desirable opposition and
check, which are necessary in parliamentary bodies.
"There has been much criticism of the management
of the Democratic majority during the seventy-third
Congress, when present Speaker Joseph W. Byrns
was floor leader. Party discipline was not well en
forced and unity in the House majority did not com
pare with that of the Clark-Underwood regime of
20 years ago. Because of seniority and geographical
considerations, Mr. Byrns was the logical choice for
Speaker.
"The new Democratic floor leader, Representative
Bankhead of Alabama, served with distinction on the
committee on rules and was an able and skilled par
liamentarian. The new chairman of the committee on
rules will probably be a northern Democrat, such as
Representative O'Connor of New York.
"The recent change in the House discharge
rule is an important point to bear in mind. The
purpose of the discharge rule is to get legislation
before the House for a vote, when the leaders do
not wish it to be considered. The operation of the
discharge rule since 1931, when the number of
signatures to a petition was fixed at 145, has been
a constant threat to the integrity of the adminis
tration program. Special interests and blocs have
used the rule as a weapon to forward their sectional
or minority group legislation.
"It becomes increasingly difficult under our system
of government to develop and put in operation a uni
fied plan for the national interest, as congressional
blocs supporting organized pressure groups are fre
quently more powerful than party organization and
discipline.
"Administration leaders in Congress have been suc
cessful in forcing a new discharge rule which fixes at
218 the number of signatures necessary to fill a dis
charge petition. It will be interesting to observe during
the seventy-fourth Congress the extent to which proce
dural devices can be used to protect the administra
tion program."
