The difficulty with women's rushing is to find who is
rushingâ€”the freshmen or the sororities. The line that
some of the Class of '38 have pulled during these rush
ing meals has pledged several sorority women third
floor Roble.
The real losers in women's rushing are the frater
nities in the sorority belt. The Sigma Chis have lent
all the new furniture they just bought to the Kappas
and their silverware to the Chi O's. The Chinese cook
may have to bring out some chopsticks, and the Sigma
Chis can go back to their grammar school days when
they were "Friendly Indians" and eat on the floor.
So far, Lagunita has pledged the biggest class of
the year.
The Wimmen's Conference Party, which is thrown
every year as a grand free-for-all for the sororities, is
supposed to be strictly neutral. The women dance
around together in a sort of No Man's Land, with the
bombs bursting in air, enemy scouts leering at all the
other enemy scouts, and no place for the Marines to
land on. The story goes that at the last party a little
D.G. came dressed in baby clothes. She happened to
be sitting out one dance, when another girl esked her
to dance and practically pledged her Pi Phi.
The hashers take the biggest beating chasing up and
down stairs for the "cellar squad," the girls who tend
the furnace and hold down the trunks during rushing.
On the hashers' role of honor are many sterling
football heroes that have their first chance at feeding
the girls during rushing. The Kappas, who usually have
their own girls trip in with two plates at a time, have
contracted some Zete football men for rushing, while
the D.G.'s string along with the Alpha Detts. The
Theta's boast Phi Delt Ben Cave, who plays football
with the long lines of zeroes on A.S.S.U. budget (but
only with the zeroes), for head hasher.
Because of the overloaded trays the hashers carry
during rushing, the worst accidents are bound to hap
pen during that period. One year, a hasher who was
having a hard time juggling a tray had to go clear out
in the front room and drop it in the Theta piano, while
another stalwart slipped on the floor, and his whole
tray went out the window.
This year's hutches have not yet been reported.
Whether they will ,bc mechanical or human is yet :.o
be determined.
