# THE 						REVIEWER
## “COLLEGE RHYTHM" At the Stanford Theatre 
### 
This is Paramount's mad and
merry melange of a department store
that goes collegiate in its advertis
ing. Of course it's good entertain -

ment, with Joe
Penner, Lyda
Roberti, Jack
Oakie, Lanny
Ross and George
Barbier in the
cast it would
have to try aw
fully hard not to

be. Penner crashes through as the
first radio comedian to make good
in pictures. Lyda Roberti sizzles in
the best way. Lanny Ross warbles in
the ditto.
Also on the bill -are a Mickey
Mouse cartoon and a musical burl
esque of "Men in White" that is one
of the best shorts in years.
