The Editor, Sir:
In reply to the gripe of yesterday's
Campus Opinioner about the flood of
"rot and corruption" to which he
has been subjected by the press. I
advise him to attend the Walrus Club
discussion Thursday and listen at
tentively.
The subject is "Propaganda" and
should answer his plea to the editor
to tell him "when a professor's edu
cational efforts become propaganda,
and why Mr. Hearst's propaganda
of hate is merely educational."
I also advise the Bull Sessioner
who yesterday attacked Campus
Opinioner and his gripe to attend
and hear explained some of the
methods and principles used by his
esteemed "free press."
