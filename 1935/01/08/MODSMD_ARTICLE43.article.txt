# BULL SESSION
## “UNPERMITTED AID GIVEN AND RECEIVED” 
### 
Once more the cry is. raised that
the tradition of the Honor Code
"Cannot Be Broken." It is an old,
old cry—one that has echoed long
and loud through the sandstone
arches of the Quad. It has been lec
tured to frosh, drilled into sopho
mores, and thrown in tne sheepish
faces of upper classmen. And still,
though the Honor Code "cannot be
broken," the Honor Code is broken.
The Honor Code is defended on ;
three major premises: (1J That it is
p Stanford tradition; (2) That it is
a noble ideal; (3) That it stops peo- I
pie from cheating on examinations
and other assigned work. If more
than the first of these contentions
were true, there might be some ex- (
c use for the Honor Code. But if the ,
Code is a tradition and nothing
more—without nobility or effective
ness —there is small reason lor con
tinuing it.

The idealism of the Honor Code ;
springs from the belief that people— j
especially Stanford people — should
be honest, upright, and true. But ,
that is as far as its idealism goes. |
The Honor Code is slightly confused j
as to just HOW honest Stanford men
and women are. It does not assume
that they are really honest—else it
would not require a pledge not to j
cheat ,on examinations.
It does not admit that they are
just as dishonest as the rest of the i
world—else it would have professors
in to watch examinations. Presum- |
ably the Honor Code believes stu- j
dents on the Farm are sort of honest, ;
which is a very queer way of look- !
ing at 1 something like "honesty." i
Second rate honesty is like a second
late poker hand —neither are worth |

• having.
Students who will cheat to get
grades will cheat both before and
after signing the pledge. If it is rec
ognized that there are people who
cheat—even at Stanford, where the
air is pure and things are noble, .it
is more sensible to actually try to
prevent cheating, than to sign pledges
and hope people will keep them.
, The Honor Code stands today, a.s
an inglorious tribute to optimism.
1 The form lingers on, but the vital
juices have all run out. The sooner
the Code is dropped officially, as it
has been dropped practically, the
more intellectual honesty will exist
af Stanford.

ator Robinson, the Democratic lead

about $100,000,000 and that the Presi
