# Wild Flower Etchings Exhibited in Art Gallery
## 
### 
Current exhibits at the Art Gallery i
are etchings and lithographs by A. !
Kay Burrell, well-known in the West |
for his conservative prints, and j
paintings of California wild flowers, |
done in oils by Waller Loos.
Among the 32 prints of California I
scenes that will be on display until
January 13 are lithographs, etchings, i
dry-points, and aquatintsâ€”illustrat- 1
ing the various methods used by ;
print makers.
Effecting a compromise between 1
the too-scientific and the too-artistic
in botanical drawings, the flowers
done in oils by Walter Loos are deco
rative and instructive. Treatment of |
foliage is varied; leaves are given
graded hue and position. Artist Loos'
works remain on exhibit until Jan
uary 22.
