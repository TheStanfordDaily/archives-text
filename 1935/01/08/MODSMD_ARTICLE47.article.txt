We made some predictions con
cerning football that turned out
fairly well at the .start of fall quar
ter, so now, with the opening of
the new year, we're going to branch
out a bit, and let our neck out a
few more notches with some start
ling revelations concerning the en
tire spoi ling program during 1935.
We see, in our crystal gazing:
In basketball—a Trojan south
ern championship. Stanford will
be runner up, we hope, by barely
beating California in the series.
Southern California will meet
Washington for the Coast cham
pionship, and Troy will win this
year. Keith Topping, the star of
two years ago for Stanford, will
have difficulty in getting into
shape after football season, and
will be worth very little during the
next few weeks.
Track—Not so good, although not
as had as many think. Stanford will
lose the Big Meet, and possibly the
S.C. dual affair, but will come back
with a better showing in the bigger
meets; that is, if the Indians enter
the N.C.A.A. To pick Dink Temple
ton to Jose to California in a track
meet is to be a bit irregular, and
we make prediction with our
tongue in our cheek. If he is lacking
iti team strength, Dink will have his
usual quota of seven or eight in
dividual stars.

ON UPGRADE
Baseball — A California league
championship, but with Stanford
pressing, and possibly beating U.S.C.
out of second place. Because of bet
ter pitching strength, the Indians
will have a much better team than
any in recent years.
Tennis—A conference champion
ship to Stanford's most well-rounded
team in recent history. The Cardi
nals will lose several first and sec
ond position matches, but they will
be deep enough in strength to win
every major meet. Gene Mako of
U.S.C. will capture the national col
legiate crown, but his team will not
be strong enough to win from Stan
lord.
Golf—Lawson Little will repeat
his national amateur victory, but
may lose his other title. The Indians
will be powerful as a team, with
Tom Dwyer, Jack Hoerner, and Spec
Stewart joining Little in the starring
role of many matches throughout the
country.
Swimming—Stanford with a con
sistently good team, winning every
collegiate meet she enters. Captain
Bob Foster as a backstroke artist of
national recognition, and several
'other individual stars, none of whom
will win a national title, however.
U.S.C. will have a greatly improved
team in conference meets.

the new year, we're going to branch
out a bit, and let our neck out a
few more notches with some start
ling revelations concerning the en
tire spoi ling program during 1935.
We see, in our crystal gazing:
In basketball—a Trojan south
ern championship. Stanford will
be runner up, we hope, by barely
beating California in the series.
Southern California will meet
Washington for the Coast cham
pionship, and Troy will win this
year. Keith Topping, the star of
two years ago for Stanford, will
have difficulty in getting into
shape after football season, and
will be worth very little during the
next few weeks.
Track—Not so good, although not
as had as many think. Stanford will
lose the Big Meet, and possibly the
S.C. dual affair, but will come back
with a better showing in the bigger
meets; that is, if the Indians enter
the N.C.A.A. To pick Dink Temple
ton to Jose to California in a track
meet is to be a bit irregular, and
we make prediction with our
tongue in our cheek. If he is lacking
iti team strength, Dink will have his
usual quota of seven or eight in
dividual stars.
1935 BASEBALL
ON UPGRADE
Baseball — A California league
championship, but with Stanford
pressing, and possibly beating U.S.C.
out of second place. Because of bet
ter pitching strength, the Indians
will have a much better team than
any in recent years.
Tennis—A conference champion
ship to Stanford's most well-rounded
team in recent history. The Cardi
nals will lose several first and sec
ond position matches, but they will
be deep enough in strength to win
every major meet. Gene Mako of
U.S.C. will capture the national col
legiate crown, but his team will not
be strong enough to win from Stan
lord.
Golf—Lawson Little will repeat
his national amateur victory, but
may lose his other title. The Indians
will be powerful as a team, with
Tom Dwyer, Jack Hoerner, and Spec
Stewart joining Little in the starring
role of many matches throughout the
country.
Swimming—Stanford with a con
sistently good team, winning every
collegiate meet she enters. Captain
Bob Foster as a backstroke artist of
national recognition, and several
'other individual stars, none of whom
will win a national title, however.
U.S.C. will have a greatly improved
team in conference meets.
We made some predictions con
cerning football that turned out
fairly well at the .start of fall quar
ter, so now, with the opening of
the new year, we're going to branch
out a bit, and let our neck out a
few more notches with some start
ling revelations concerning the en
