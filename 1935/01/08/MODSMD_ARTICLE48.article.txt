# GRIDMEN BEST ON COAST, MAYBE
## 
### 
Football—The Red machine again
winning the Coast Conference, with
California as runner up and the title
depending on the Big Game. This
prediction is assuming the Stanford
seniors keep their equilibrium.
Southern California will be better,
but not good enough, and Washing
ton will be as strong as last year.
Again barring senior trouble, Stan
ford will be unbeaten. Bones Ham
ilton will be an all-American finally,
.sharing honors with Monk Moscrip
mikl Bob Reynolds. Bobby Grayson
i'gain will be a nearly unanimous
choice. In the Rose Bowl—but that's
in and outside our scope.
Rugby—Again Stanford as far as
the intercollegiate matches go. The
delayed football season will hamper
Stanford somewhat, but it also will
bother California, and the major
trouble will come from some of the
independent teams in the league.
British Columbia, if the "Reps" come
down again, will win.
Soccer—A come-up next fall, but
still defeated by U.S.F. Stanford
may be runner-up in the league.
