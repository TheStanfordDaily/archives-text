# LET'S TALK ABOUT THE WEATHER

### 
(Editorial)
One thousand women and several hundred rumors are
floating about the Stanford campus today.
While nine sororities struggle to survive the rushing
season without the blemish of underhand methods brought
to light, campus gossips tell in audacious stage whispers
of terrible doings that are going on.
Somebody's second cousin claims that a few houses will
violate the "gentleman's agreement" in regard to the num
ber of pledges each sorority has agreed to take as a maxi
mum. A long-faced friend adds that the girls of one group
and the freshmen they favor already wear attractive little
hair-ribbons of the same color. The horrifying tales ot
what little girls had said to them 011 the last double-date,
or in some other illegal manner, are growing hourly in
proportion.
Nothing can be accomplished by all this talk, whether
the persons and groups concerned are behaving properly
or not.
The houses only ask to be left alone, and to see it they
cannot work out their own problems successfully in their
own way without interference.
They ask that you and 1 mind our own business for the
next few days. After that, if we have any legitimate gripes,
we may have our say.
They are experimenting with a new system of rushing
and honestly want to profit thereby.
The least we can do is to give them the chance tliev ask
for, kill these wild rumors, and reserve judgment until the
Sunday after.
Freshmen can forget the unsound, hypocritical, preju
diced "advice" dished out by family, friends, and masculine
"admirers."
They don't want our advice, because their decisions will
not a fleet us. They will live three years at the sorority of
their choice, with the friends they select. It is not an easy
selection.
Let us not confuse where we seek to aid.
