# HOOPSTERS START PREPARATIONS FOR FRIDAY'S OPENER
## Topping, Schott on Squad; Turner, Bell May Not Face Trojans 
### 
A peppy, confident Cardinal quin
tet went through its first workout
yesterday afternoon for the all-im
portant conference opener Friday
night against the Trojans, following
its return early yesterday morning
from the barnstorming trip through
the Midwest.
The stored-up energy of a two
day train ride from Omaha, Ne
braska, where they played their last
j game Friday night, and the experi
| enee gained by playing the best col
lege and pro teams of the Midwest
were easily apparent as the Cards
spent their first afternoon in the
Enema gym in three weeks.
Topping, Schott Out
Further cause for a rise in the In
dian hopes for a win over the U.S.C.
five was justified when Keith Top
ping and Carl Schott joined the
squad, their football activities hav
ing closed for the present with the
Rose Bowl. Topping has been play
ing center off and on for Indian
j quintets during the past two seasons
and his height and weight make him
particularly valuable for under
bucket play.
Schott held down a guard post for
the frosh last year, and proved him
self a steady defensive man. Top
ping and Schott may not be caught
up enough with the rest of the squad
to be used in the U.S.C. series this
week-end but should be ready for
Cal on the following Friday and Sat
urday.
May Lose Turner
While gaining Topping and Schott,
Coach John Bunn also temporarily
lost the services of two other hoop- I
sters. Howell Turner, first-string I
forward, has a questionable scholas- i
tic standing, due to a final neces
sarily postponed when the squad
left the campus early for the Mid
west trip.
Ken Bell, center, will probably be
lost for a longer time, his playing
in the U.S.C. series being a matter
of considerable doubt. Bell is just
recovering from an ear operation
which he underwent in Omaha, and
did not work out with the squad last
night.
Squad Stricken
Bell's sickness was typical of that j
of the entire squad, except that his
case was the most severe one. Fol
lowing the White Eagle Oilers game
in Kansas City, the entire squad !
came down with some type of the 1
flu due to an unheated pullman.
During the seven remaining games
of the trip Coach John Bunn had to |
struggle along with a squad broken
by sickness and unable to play top
speed basketball for the full game, j
Bell, for example, traveled from one
hospital to another, rather from one .
court to another, and was unable to '
play after the third game.
From the standpoint of finance .
and the reception accorded the Cards |
in the Midwest, however, the trip
was pronounced as highly satisfac- :
tory, with crowds of 4000 to 6000 be- j
ing the usual attendance.

soon as they walk in New Guinea.
perfect record of victories.
Fencing—A mediocre team, with
Captain Jerry Bowen leading the;
Coast as an individual star.
Polo—Same old thing. The best on
the Coast, but beaten by Arizona. I
not quite as strong a team this year. |
