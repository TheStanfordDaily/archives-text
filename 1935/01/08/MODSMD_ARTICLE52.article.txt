# '35 Football Hopes Bright
## Only 5 of Regular Squad Not Returning 
### 
| The second successful year has
come to an unsuccessful close, and
Stanford football players have once
more gone for books, basketball,
baseball, etc.
And now that publicity on the Ala- 1
j baina-Stanford Rose Bowl game has !
I dwindled to an occasional mention J
| in sports columnists' productions, a ;
stock may be taken on whom and
what to expect for next year.
That is easy: the whole regular ■
squad with the exception of two
backs and three linemen—Buck Van
Dellen and Bob Maentz, and Jack
Drown, Ed Lettunich, and Carlos
Monsalve—will return. They will i
all be in shape, it appears, since no j
one was seriously hurt in the Pasa
dena game. Captain Bones Hamilton
is recovering from an injured collar j
bone, but he will be well within !
the next week or ten days.
Many of the Indians will go into .
I other sports. Hamilton, Bobby
j Grayson, Monk Moscrip, and Stan
Anderson probably will appear as
j first-string baseball players. Keith
: Topping and Carl Schott are already
working out with the basketball
i team, and Bob Reynolds and Claude
Callaway will join the track forces.
Many of the lesser lights on the team
J are playing rugby.
The only work on football this
quarter will be some routine drill
! with freshmen, in which Coach Tiny
Thornhill and assistants plan to de
velop representatives of '38 into var
! sity material that will plug the left
half and tackle gaps.
