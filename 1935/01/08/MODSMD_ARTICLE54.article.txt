# TENNIS STARS MAY GO PROFESSIONAL
## 
### 
Two may be able to live cheaper
than one, but many leading tennis!
players â€¢ have recently been unable |
to support themselves on the "double !
personalities" they assumed in male- !
ing out "expense accounts" while |
traveling around the country as the |
guests of various tournament man- I
agements.
Consequently, when Bill O'Brien, j
tennis promoter, waved very fat con- '
tracts under the noses of Bill Tilden, i
Ellsworth Vines, Lester Rollo Stoef
en, and George Lott, these aforesaid j
gentlemen \Vho had gained their ten- j
nis reputation in amateur ranks, de- !
cided it was better to keep their i
financial integrity in professional j
tennis.
Prospects that latest converts to!
the pro ranks may be Fred Perry, I
world's champion, and Helen Jacobs, j
U.S. women's champion, have been !
given out by O'Brien.
Miss Jacobs, in England, who |
would very much like to beat Helen j
Wills Moody in a clean-cut combat
before she dies, has been wavering j
over offers which climbed to $20,000
oyer the week-end.
O'Brien claims that Perry will sign J
a contract for $40,000 upon his ar
rival in San Francisco from Aus
tralia on February 21. Perry has not ;
had a chance to deny this.
