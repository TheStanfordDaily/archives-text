# RUGGERS TO OPEN SEASON WITH TWO GAMES SATURDAY
## First String Men To Battle Argonauts; Seconds Face Barbarians 
### 
Stanford rugby starts Saturday'
with a double-header, opening a sea
son that will last through the month
of March. The first team will play
the Argonauts, and the seconds will
engage the Barbarians. These two
are San Francisco teams composed
largely of Britishers with former ex
perience.
Alusti/.a May Play
Card hopes were boosted yester
day with the word that Frank Alus
tiza, of Basque fame, will probably
turn out for the fifteen. Alustiza is
well fitted for rugger play, with his
well-known kicking ability, speed,;
and ability to "take it."
Beliefs that Buck Van Dellen
would join the team were dissipated j
with the word that the long-stridding
light halfback will journey to Hono
lulu with the Coast All-Star team
for a game this month.
Of the footballers, however, John- j
ny Reisner, Jack Walton, and Joe'
Vigna of the Pasadena bunch will in j
all probability be out. Reisner was 1
the team star last year, tearing off J
repeated sideline jaunts for long runs
from his flank position.
Schedule Submitted
Coach Harry Maloney has submit- j
ted his revised schedule to the j
Board of Athletic Control, and that;
document will be ready for publica- !
tion soon.
The two games Saturday will be !
no warm-up for the Card forces, for i
the Argonauts and Barbs are al-!
ready in the middle of their season, j
having been competing all Decern- I
ber. Stanford, on the contrary, has |
had no more than a month of prac- j
tice, and no games.
Rain halted any organized prac-1
tice yesterday, although several men I
took workouts for condition's sake.
