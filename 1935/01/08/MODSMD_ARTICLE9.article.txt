# Ex Committeemen Consider Routine Business Tonight
## 
### 
Since Marvie Kahn is still in the
process of returning from the con
vention of college presidents he at
tended during Christmas vacation
in Boston, and since there is no
special business, Ex Committee's
meeting tonight will be largely rou
tine in nature.
Helen Ray, A.S.S.U. vice-presi
dent, who will preside in the absence
of President Kahn, assured The Daily
last night that there is nothing sched
uled for tonight's meeting but the
usual consideration of minutes and
approval of dates.
President Kahn is expected to be
back from his transcontinental tour
on Wednesday. On his return it is
possible that the fireworks will start
on the proposition of taking 15 cents
of the 75-cent subscription fee from
The Stanford Daily.
This was attempted once last
quarter, but Ex Committee allowed
The Daily to keep the full rate but
with the qualification that the* con
tested 15 cents be used for such edi
torial expenses as pictures of local
celebrities and campus events, and
general editorial improvement of the
paper.
During the interim, The Daily has
used the money for the cuts. Mean
while, Kahn and Student Manager
Cave, busy in their efforts to pro
vide finances for the new theatre,
have cast envious eyes on The Daily
subscription fee. Rumors have come
out of the Old Union offices of the
A.S.S.U. executives that a second at
tempt to get The Daily's 15 cents
will be made in Ex Committee
shortly, possibly the Tuesday meet
ing of next week.
