# Hauptmann Defiant While Two Witnesses Shout Accusations
## Cab Driver Names Suspect As Man Who Delivered Lindy Ransom Note 
### 
FLEMINGTON, N.J., Jan. 8 (/P).—
Two men—one an elderly Sourland
neighbor of the Charles A Lind
berghs, the other a Bronx cab driver
—laid an accusing hand today on
Bruno Richard Hauptmann on trial
for the murder of the kidnaped
Lindbergh baby.
Gingerly, 87-year-old Amandus
Hochmuth, who lives at the entrance
of the Lindbergh lane, unexpectedly
tapped the stolid carpenter on the
shoulder as he identified him as the
man, in a "dirty green car" contain
ing a ladder, whom he saw from his
porch the day of the kidnaping—
March 1, 1932.
That's the Man"
Then Joseph Perrone, the cab
driver, slapped the same rigid shoul
der and almost shouted: "That's the
man!" -who eleven nights later sent
him to Dr. John F. (Jafsie) Condon,
elderly kidnap negotiator, with a
note.
Hauptmann stiffened. He mut
tered, almost inaudibly:
"You're a liar."
It was another day of swift sensa
tions in the case by which the State
of New Jersey hopes to send Haupt
mann to the electric chair.
Already the carpenter had been
accused by the father of the slain
baby himself; already both Charles
and Anne Lindbergh and Betty Gow,
the baby's nurse, have told their own
stories.
"Jafsie'' Appears
Shortly before the fifth day of the
trial ended in the tense atmosphere
of the old Hunterdon County court
room Dr. Condon himself entered.
Regarded as perhaps the state's
chief witness, the aging educator,
who paid the $50,000 ransom for a
dead baby, walked into the court
room and took a seat near Colonel
Lindbergh.
Prosecutors expect that when he
testifies, probably tomorrow, he will
accuse Hauptmann directly as the
man who took the ransom from his
hands.
The way was paved for his testi
mony late today by several wit
nesses, including his friend and
bodyguard, A1 Reich, who drove Dr.
Condon to his rendezvous with the
ransom collector in St. Raymond's
Cemctary, the Bronx, the night of
April 2, 1932.

Condon to his rendezvous with the
ransom collector in St. Raymond's
Cemctary, the Bronx, the night of
April 2, 1932.
FLEMINGTON, N.J., Jan. 8 (/P).—
Two men—one an elderly Sourland
neighbor of the Charles A Lind
berghs, the other a Bronx cab driver
—laid an accusing hand today on
Bruno Richard Hauptmann on trial
for the murder of the kidnaped
Lindbergh baby.
Gingerly, 87-year-old Amandus
Hochmuth, who lives at the entrance
of the Lindbergh lane, unexpectedly
tapped the stolid carpenter on the
shoulder as he identified him as the
man, in a "dirty green car" contain
ing a ladder, whom he saw from his
porch the day of the kidnaping—
March 1, 1932.
That's the Man"
Then Joseph Perrone, the cab
driver, slapped the same rigid shoul
der and almost shouted: "That's the
man!" -who eleven nights later sent
him to Dr. John F. (Jafsie) Condon,
elderly kidnap negotiator, with a
note.
Hauptmann stiffened. He mut
tered, almost inaudibly:
"You're a liar."
It was another day of swift sensa
tions in the case by which the State
of New Jersey hopes to send Haupt
mann to the electric chair.
Already the carpenter had been
accused by the father of the slain
baby himself; already both Charles
and Anne Lindbergh and Betty Gow,
the baby's nurse, have told their own
stories.
"Jafsie'' Appears
Shortly before the fifth day of the
trial ended in the tense atmosphere
of the old Hunterdon County court
room Dr. Condon himself entered.
Regarded as perhaps the state's
chief witness, the aging educator,
who paid the $50,000 ransom for a
dead baby, walked into the court
room and took a seat near Colonel
Lindbergh.
Prosecutors expect that when he
testifies, probably tomorrow, he will
accuse Hauptmann directly as the
man who took the ransom from his
hands.
The way was paved for his testi
mony late today by several wit
nesses, including his friend and
bodyguard, A1 Reich, who drove Dr.
Condon to his rendezvous with the
ransom collector in St. Raymond's
Cemctary, the Bronx, the night of
April 2, 1932.
