ROME, Jan. 8 (/P). —A prediction
the Italo-Jugoslav enmities may be,
buried by the new Italo-French un
derstanding was advanced today as
France's foreign minister, Pierre
Laval, left for home.
The authoritative Giornale D'ltalia,
in an editorial outlining the agree
ments' Laval and Benito Mussolini
achieved during the former's four
day visit, said "one result should be
an Italo-Jugoslav rapproachement."
"They (the agreements) confirm
once the absence of any foundation
for suspicion among the Little En
tente and above all in Jugoslavia,
the Giornale said. "Therefore, Italo-
Jugoslav relations finally can emerge
from that deformation into which
propaganda and the actions of some
Jugoslav sectors forced them, and
turn toward the invitation of friend
ship extended by Mussolini."
The French foreign minister ex
plained the agreements to the rep
resentatives in Rome of the three
Little Entente members—Jugoslavia,
Rumania, and Czechoslovakia —and
of Austria, before departing.
