Displaying a surety and ease of
presentation, Miss Elizabeth Strang,
violinist, and Miss Bethel Melvin,
feature pianist and accompanist,
presented a concert in the Assembly
Hall last night. The program sup
planted the usual Tuesday Evening
Lecture, which is sponsored by the
Committee on Public Exercises.
Miss Melvin showed clearness and
brilliance in the frequent running
passages in her three piano selec
tions, and power in the heavier por
tions. Her interpretation of "Re
flections in the Water," by Debussy,
was sincere and moving.
The audience was particularly re
sponsive to Miss Strong's rendition
of the gay and lively "Holzapfel und
Schlehwein." In Bach's light "Ari
oso" Miss Strong showed sympathy
and depth of feeling.
Miss Strong has been in New York
for the last few years, where she
has been doing radio and concert
work. She is, however, well known
in San Francisco and throughout the
bay region, where she has appeared
often in concert.
In San Francisco she studied with
Louis Persinger for several years,
and in New York with Emmanuel
Zetlin and Carl Flesch.
Having recently returned from
New York, where she was makinj
Duo-Arte recordings, Miss Melvin
is at present giving a series of con
certs over station KYA in San Fran
cisco. She is widely known as a
coricert pianist and accompanist in
New York and on the Coast.
