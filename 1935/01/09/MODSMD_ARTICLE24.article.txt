# Theatre Is Subject of Ex Meeting
## Committee Tangles In 2-Hour Consultation 
### 
What was scheduled for a routine
meeting turned out to be a two-hour
session last night, as Ex Committee
tangled with promotional problems
for the coming A.S.S.U. concert of
Januai'y 30; voted to recommend
that a theatrical architect be brought
into "consultation in relation'* to the
New Theatre; granted athletic
awards; and passed on dates.
The Cardinals were given charge
of publicity for the Concert Series'
All-Stanford Music program.
Believing that a theatre should not
be constructed until after a theatre
architect had consulted the original
architects (Norman Barnes, music
master, said: "We aren't going to be
building it twice.") Ex Committee
went on record as approving the
hiring of the architect.
During the month that the com
mittee was not in session a propo
sition in regard to the general sale
of Stanford rings was broached to
the student body heads by a manu
facturing concern. The idea sounded
like a good thing to the officials.
A telephone poll was taken. Every
thing seemed all right.
It finally worked out, however,
that the profit promised the A.S.S.U.
was 15 per cent of the difference
between the wholesale and retail
price rather than the whole price,
and a lot of fire went out of the
student enthusiasm. It eventually
developed that no one remembered
who had voted for the propositions,
so an investigation is under way.
Returning to the Ex Committee
meeting after a long vacation, mem
bers plunged into their work with
more than their usual gusto. Ex
Committee wits had their usual
quota of laughs.
In connection with the Concert
Series program, someone mentioned
the fact that the A.S.S.U. should
expect some co-operation, since it
was subsidizing Stanford music or
ganizations to the extent of $2,000
annually. At this point, Student
Manager Cave said: "For $2,000 I
would give a concert myself." There
were no tSkers.
Representative of the People Bill
Rogers hinted that "Her Master's
Voice," winter quarter Dramatic
Council production might be slightly
risque.
"I know the scene to which you
are referring," said Dramatic Man
ager Dick Frank. "Now he sits on
the foot of the bed."

ager Dick Frank. "Now he sits on
the foot of the bed."
What was scheduled for a routine
meeting turned out to be a two-hour
session last night, as Ex Committee
tangled with promotional problems
for the coming A.S.S.U. concert of
Januai'y 30; voted to recommend
that a theatrical architect be brought
into "consultation in relation'* to the
New Theatre; granted athletic
awards; and passed on dates.
The Cardinals were given charge
of publicity for the Concert Series'
All-Stanford Music program.
Believing that a theatre should not
be constructed until after a theatre
architect had consulted the original
architects (Norman Barnes, music
master, said: "We aren't going to be
building it twice.") Ex Committee
went on record as approving the
hiring of the architect.
During the month that the com
mittee was not in session a propo
sition in regard to the general sale
of Stanford rings was broached to
the student body heads by a manu
facturing concern. The idea sounded
like a good thing to the officials.
A telephone poll was taken. Every
thing seemed all right.
It finally worked out, however,
that the profit promised the A.S.S.U.
was 15 per cent of the difference
between the wholesale and retail
price rather than the whole price,
and a lot of fire went out of the
student enthusiasm. It eventually
developed that no one remembered
who had voted for the propositions,
so an investigation is under way.
Returning to the Ex Committee
meeting after a long vacation, mem
bers plunged into their work with
more than their usual gusto. Ex
Committee wits had their usual
quota of laughs.
In connection with the Concert
Series program, someone mentioned
the fact that the A.S.S.U. should
expect some co-operation, since it
was subsidizing Stanford music or
ganizations to the extent of $2,000
annually. At this point, Student
Manager Cave said: "For $2,000 I
would give a concert myself." There
were no tSkers.
Representative of the People Bill
Rogers hinted that "Her Master's
Voice," winter quarter Dramatic
Council production might be slightly
risque.
"I know the scene to which you
are referring," said Dramatic Man
ager Dick Frank. "Now he sits on
the foot of the bed."
