### 
JOLIET, 111., Jan. 8 (/P>. â€” The
"electric eye" won't even trust a
trusty. The trusty who found this
out is Phadeas Johnson, 275-pound
convict whom the warden sent out
for a cigar.
Every time Phadeas passed the
electric eye it would flash a light,
and the warden had him searched
to see what was the mattei. In the
heel of Phadeas' huge shoe a shoe
horn was found, explaining the
mystery.
