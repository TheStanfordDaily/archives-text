# Various Students Voice Opinions on Honor Code's Fate
## Campus Tells Reactions To Daily Editorials On Discussed Topic 
### 
Cheating on fall quarter final ex
aminations brought three-quarter
expulsion to an unnamed Stanford
man last week.
This was disclosed yesterday as
students from a dozen sections of
the campus voiced their opinions on
the Honor Code, boosted in a recent
Daily editorial and roasted in a re
cent Bull Session.
Ex Committee members were gen
erally inclined to favor the Code.
Comment ranged from Bill Rogeis'
terse: "I'm for it," to Bill Stark\s
"The honor system Is Stanford's
finest tradition, and its observance is
characteristic of the standards of
Stanford men and women."
Committeeman A1 Blackman saw
practical difficulties: "If the Honor
Code works, it is fine, but the way it
has been interpreted to new students
defeats the Code's purpose."
A1 Page, chairman of Men's Coun
cil, and Iris Forsyth, Women's Coun
cil member, both thought the code
served a worthy purpose.
Bob Grantier, Men's Council mem
ber, struck out particularly at the
Bull Session attack. He stated:
"The Honor Code hasn't -e perfect
record, but I feel that Dave Mcllin
koff has junked truth in favor of
sensationalism when he says that it
has failed. As compared with a proc
tor system, that would make cheating
in examinations little more than a
game of hide and seek between stu
dent and professor, I certainly pre
fer an Honor Code that minimizes
cheating and pays the students the
compliment of self-government."
Opposed to this sanguine view was
the brief comment of Student Man
ager Ben Cave, who declared: "The
Honor Code is a flop."
Don Brown, English major, was
even less in favor of the system: "The
Honor Code is an insult to character
and intelligence. It makes spies out
of everyone who won't cheat. That's
why I like it."
A scattering of student opinion
thought the whole matter was rather
funny.
Dave Hawkins, philosophy grad:
"It lends spice to otherwise dull ex
aminations."
Walt O'Bannon, student: "Cheaters
never win, do they?"
Joe Gill, another student: "Like
prohibition, it is a noble experiment.
And the time for repeal has now
come."
