# Error of Arizona Gold Discovery Draws Many
## 
### 
PHOENIX, Ariz., Jan. B.—Hun
dreds of persons—some seeking gold
and others just curious—flocked to
Superstition Mountains today after
Charles Williams, lost since Friday,
found his way out of the labyrinth
of canyons with a story of a fabu
lously rich "gold find" and weird ex
periences.
Skeptics wagged their heads over
the story of gold piled up as though
it had been shoveled in place" and
expressed doubt that the handful of
almost pure gold nuggets Williams
exhibited came from a virgin de
posit, but they did not chock the
rush to the mountain range.
