# Kilauea May Soon Erupt
## 
### 
HILO, Jan. 8 (/P). â€”The great vol
cano Kilauea gave indications today
of impending eruption.
The seismograph in the observa
tory at the rim trembled and long
cracks opened along the sides of the
Haledemaumau fire pit. All visitors
to the pit rim were warned condi
tions were dangerous.
Dr. Thomas A. Jaggar, volcanolo
gist, hurried a crew of men to make
fast a cable of 1000 feet along the
crack edges and to post warning
signs.
The volcanologists surveying the
brooding volcano predicted tre
mendous landslides were imminent.
Although shocks otherwise arc im
perceptible, the seismograph has
registered them for two days.
