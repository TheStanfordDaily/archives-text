# How Now, Watson? Notre Dame's Stage Bow
## 
### 
A dispatch from South Bend informs the
sporting public that Notre Dame has "tight
ened up" on its football eligibility rules, and
current comment anent the "tightening"
would indicate that sports critics consider
that the Notre Dame step is prompted by
I lie highest and purest of idealistic motives.
Tut, tut, my dear Watson. Hasty conclu
sions are dangerous in the commenting, as
well as the detective business.
Let us consider the Notre Dame restriction,
and possible reasons for it, other than the
idealistic kind.
Notre Dame will permit its footballing ath
letes to compete only during their first eight
semesters in college. After the first four years
in which it is normally possible for a student
to graduate he will no longer be eligible. In
other words there will be in the future no
men lingering around to compete in their
fifth or si\th year, because they elected not
to take their sophomore year of competition
or were prevented by reason of injuries.
Idealistic sportsmanship? Ah, no, my dear
Watson. Plain tight-fisted business methods.
Notre Dame is a national magnet drawing
athletic material from all states to bask in
the glory of its legendary great football teams
and easy entree to lucrative coaching jobs.
Many scholarships are obviously needed to
cement these prospective coaches in their
places. A player receiving a stipend for his
presence on the team gels injured, and misses
a season of play. But he does not drop out of
school; he remains to collect bis scholarship
and his free education because be can live
cheaper and better in college than out in the
eold world.
Consequently he gains a five- or six-year
college course, plus the opportunity to make
an impressive showing when he does take his
competition. The Notre Dame authorities are
ending all lliis. They believe the athlete will
lake his years of varsity play when he can
get them; he will drop out of school when
injured rather than jeopardize bis future eli
gibility.
Noire Dame will be enabled to subsidize
other material with the scholarships which
formerly were wasted on these non-producing
parasites. Idealism, hell no; efficiency, yes.
A simple matter of deduction, my dear
Walson!
