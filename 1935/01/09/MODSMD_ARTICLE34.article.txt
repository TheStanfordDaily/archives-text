# Forum on Propaganda
## 
### 
The Walrus Club, Ihnl staunch and somc
liuies only bulwark of intellectual discussion
on the Stanford cani]>us, resumes its old-time
activity tomorrow night with the first of a
scries of forums to he held this quarter.
Propaganda, nemesis of popular govern
ment, tool of dictators, and weapon of any
faction or ism that seeks to force its belief
upon the people without benefit of intellectual
.ippcal, will be the subject considered tomor
row night.
Two experts in their field will start the ball
rolling with short t:ilks and then will throw
the meeting open to discussion from the lloor.
Dr. Kdward K. Strong will outline the psy
chological basis of propaganda while Mifchel
Saadi will speak of the Merriam-Sinclair mud
slinging fiasco.
There are those who would have us believe
that the American government is tottering
from I he pernicious effects of Communist
propaganda; if is certain that 110 dictator
governed nation is free of it, and it is very
apparent that America h;is its share whenever
some genuinely controversial economic or
political question arises. As evidence of flic

hitter we need go hack no further than the
gubernatorial campaign of last November in
our own state Â«>l California.
Those who heinoan the paucity of intellec
tual activity on the Stanford campus have an
opportunity tomorrow night to show the sin
cerity of their criticism.
