An eight-to-one Supreme Court decision
tells the people of this country that too much
power has heen given the President in the
oil control clause of the National Industrial
Recovery Act.
That is not news to some, hut it is of the
utmost significance to all. There are those
who will contend that the delegation of that
authority to Mr. Roosevelt was and is the best
possible course. Many will attempt to refute
the latter premise.
Seeking not to pass snap judgment upon
the setup in entirety, college men and women
join the rest of the world in wondering just
what is going to happen during the present
session of Congress.
Opportents of the New Dcai shout that the
oil verdict is but the lirst victory in a battle
that may be carried straight through the long
line of ."recovery" legislation.
New Dealers reply that the decision does
not really stop the codes from achieving theiu
actual purpose. In the meantime, Congress
must consider renewal or replacement of the
NBA, which expires in June of this year.
But what will happen when the problem is
tossed into the lap of that legislative body is
difficult to say.
If you the hungry lioness a juicy morsel
of raw meat, it doesn't last very long. Poli
ticians, many of them, would like very much
to dish out special advantages to their respec
tive electorates if the chance is offered.
.lust to what extent the Roosevelt forces
can actually keep the boys in line is the im
portant question today. Undoubtedly, a re
vised NBA, perhaps under a new and popular
slogan, will be presented for the legislative
approval. But how much bargaining of selfish
motivation will come about before the deed
is done?
The battle is on. The constitutionality of
the key legislation is being challenged. Swing
right or left, action is imminent, and the
debate will be both fierce and potent. The
road little tried, signs do not point the way
very far.
Which highway, if any, to Becovery, mis
ter?
