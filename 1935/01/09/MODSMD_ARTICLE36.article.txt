# Music for Our Ears
## 
### 
1935 rolls around with the promise of the
! second event on the Student' Concert Series
i playing a very important part in Stanford's
1 cultural development.
I The January 30 program, entirely new to
i the series this year, will feature campus talent
j exclusively. It oilers the Stanford hand, glee
S ehih, and orchestra, with their combined tal
j cuts, to show that good musical entertainment
I is not lacking at home when we seek to pro
j vide the Hough with some of the better things
1 in life.
j Drop in at the Concert Series office in the
j Old Union to see that you gel a (food reserved
i seat while they last. Reasonably priced, the
| good ones may not be waiting long.
