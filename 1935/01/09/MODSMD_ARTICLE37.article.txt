## WITH ARTHUR MARTIN CATHCART 
### John McClelland 
Early in November it was predicted in this column
that the question of the constitutionality of NIRA
would soon arise in courts throughout the country
with new vigor and that judges and juries would prob
ably not uphold the recovery laws in nearly every
case as they had in the past.
Monday when the Supreme Court declared uncon
stitutional the first important bit of New Deal legisla
tion to come before it, that prediction proved to be
not wholly unfounded.
Professor Arthur Cathcart, who has been vitally in
terested in the legal side of NRA since its inception,
attaches a certain significance to this important act of
the Supreme Court but scoffs at the statements of
certain newspapers that it means "the bottom has
fallen out of NRA."
From the rather sketchy reports that have come
through from Washington, Professor Cathcart con
cludes that the vital point has been entirely missed
if any attempt was being made actually to prove
NRA as a whole unconstitutional. As he said in
his classes yesterday, the only thing that has been
proven unconstitutional was a single provision in
the NRA oil code which authorized the president
to prohibit the transportation in inter-state and
foreign commerce of petroleum.
In this provision Congress passed the buck to the
president, saying that he could prohibit inter-state
commerce in oil IF HE WANTED TO. It is obviously
unconstitutional for Congress to delegate anyone to
orohibit anything unless they definitely tell them to
do so.
"The really vital question in these matters," Cath
cart states, "is not of control of transportation, but
control of production. But neither of these questions
was involved in this current decision. The Supreme
Court in the past has said that Congress can prohibit
ihe interstate commerce of such undesirable things as
liquor and dope, but it has never given Congress
lower lo prohibit commerce of such things as oil.
nra the president has been making such
prohibitions and it certainly is not constitutional for
him to do so. The question here is—could Congress
itself have made these prohibitions?
"But the really important issue, and it is likely
the right to control production, working hours, re
to come up in subsequent appeals, is—has Congress
tailing, or trading. If the Supreme Court should say
no to this, then the bottom really would drop out
of NRA."
Again a prediction is made. The present Congress
will not only have to watch itself and not let anything
else like Section 9-C of the oil code get through, but
it will also have to do something about similar provi
sions in other codes now in effect or the whole NRA
structure will fall to pieces.
Monday's decision, about which so much ballyhoo
has been printed, "does not get u.s much nearer the
solution of the big problems of NRA," to use Mr. Calh
curt's own words.

Early in November it was predicted in this column
that the question of the constitutionality of NIRA
would soon arise in courts throughout the country
with new vigor and that judges and juries would prob
ably not uphold the recovery laws in nearly every
case as they had in the past.
Monday when the Supreme Court declared uncon
stitutional the first important bit of New Deal legisla
tion to come before it, that prediction proved to be
not wholly unfounded.
Professor Arthur Cathcart, who has been vitally in
terested in the legal side of NRA since its inception,
attaches a certain significance to this important act of
the Supreme Court but scoffs at the statements of
certain newspapers that it means "the bottom has
fallen out of NRA."
From the rather sketchy reports that have come
through from Washington, Professor Cathcart con
cludes that the vital point has been entirely missed
if any attempt was being made actually to prove
NRA as a whole unconstitutional. As he said in
his classes yesterday, the only thing that has been
proven unconstitutional was a single provision in
the NRA oil code which authorized the president
to prohibit the transportation in inter-state and
foreign commerce of petroleum.
In this provision Congress passed the buck to the
president, saying that he could prohibit inter-state
commerce in oil IF HE WANTED TO. It is obviously
unconstitutional for Congress to delegate anyone to
orohibit anything unless they definitely tell them to
do so.
"The really vital question in these matters," Cath
cart states, "is not of control of transportation, but
control of production. But neither of these questions
was involved in this current decision. The Supreme
Court in the past has said that Congress can prohibit
ihe interstate commerce of such undesirable things as
liquor and dope, but it has never given Congress
lower lo prohibit commerce of such things as oil.
nra the president has been making such
prohibitions and it certainly is not constitutional for
him to do so. The question here is—could Congress
itself have made these prohibitions?
"But the really important issue, and it is likely
the right to control production, working hours, re
to come up in subsequent appeals, is—has Congress
tailing, or trading. If the Supreme Court should say
no to this, then the bottom really would drop out
of NRA."
Again a prediction is made. The present Congress
will not only have to watch itself and not let anything
else like Section 9-C of the oil code get through, but
it will also have to do something about similar provi
sions in other codes now in effect or the whole NRA
structure will fall to pieces.
Monday's decision, about which so much ballyhoo
has been printed, "does not get u.s much nearer the
solution of the big problems of NRA," to use Mr. Calh
curt's own words.
