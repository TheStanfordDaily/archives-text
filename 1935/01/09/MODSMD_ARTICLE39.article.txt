# BULL SESSION
## FOOEY. MR. HUEY 
### 
Given a man, a mouth, and hard
times—and the hard pressed masses
will fall for anything. On the prin
ciple that anything different must be
an improvement, the masses of men
through countless generations have
followed one Pied Piper after an
other. They have been duped by this
one, betrayed by that, and aided by
a very few. But there is nothing
worse than suffering in silence, so
the people join ranks behind every
new demagogue who know.show to
talk about their suffering.
Thousands followed Sinclair to
defeat without ever having even a
faint ghost of an intelligent glimmer
of what EPIC really meant.
Millions of Germans voted for the
Austrian paperhanger without
knowing whether Nazism was Na
tionalistic or Socialistio, or tl|at
there was any difference between the
two. Certainly, few of them ex
pected to get a decreased standard
of living. For goodness sputtered
from the lips of Adolf Hitler, and
goodness sounded good.
There have been American spell
binders ere this. And Americans
have proved themselves no less gul
lible than Germans or Californians.
The current political hog caller

sweeps northward from the bayous j
of Dixie. Prophetic parents named
him Huey Long.
Long's latest outburst in the
United States Senate is directed at
Jim Farley and the Democratic
gravy organization. Wh it could!
please individualistic Americans |
more than Ruey's: "God send me to i
hell before I have to have patronage I
through that kind of thing!" There |
will be many who will conclude from !
that that Huey Long objects to the j
usual skullduggery connected with ;
the handing out of political plums j
and pudding. A few might even say !
that Huey is a man of ideals.
That sort of people will vote for !
hot air and "Share Our Wealth"'
without ever stopping to look at
Long's own state government. With- i
cut ever looking at puppet i
legislators, and suppressed editors, j
and machine-gun elections, and all j
the rest of the Long program that j
shames not only Louisiana but the !
whole country.
Long represents the worst element !
in our political life: intolerant, ig- j
norant, and crooked. If he ever gets j
beyond Louisiana, America will be |
on the greased slide to the bogs of j
red, black, and brown dictatorships. |
