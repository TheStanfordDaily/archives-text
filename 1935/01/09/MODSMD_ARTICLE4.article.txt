# Ickes Plans New Law to Regulate Oil
## Crash in Price Results From Court Ruling 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 8 (/P).—Ob
viously concerned that the Supreme
Court had ruled against the first
New Deal measure to reach it, the
Roosevelt Administration moved to
day to re-enact legislation designed
to conti'oi the interstate shipment of
oil.
Senator Connally, author of the
section of the National Industrial
Recovery Act which was ruled il
legal, immediately drafted a joint
resolution specifically penalizing
shipments in violation of a State
quota, and authorizing the President
to makes rules and regulations for
enforcement.
Earlier, Secretary Ickes, the oil
administrator, said he would confer
with Chairman Cole of a House
Commence Subcommittee investiga
ting the industry in order to expe
dite drafting of a new bill.
Code Poorly Drawn
Asserting that the section might
have been "more carefully and skill
fully drawn," Ickes said the oil code
v/hich was not affected by the de
cision, was inadequate to control
production in Texas. Elsewhere the
oil administration has set up quotas
within the states, and seeks to con
trol both production and shipment
under the code.
In Texas, however, allocations
within the state are fixed by the
Railroad Commission. After an un
successful effort to control inter
state shipments under the cede, the
oil administration resorted to sec
tion 9c of the NRA.
"While wo intend to do the best
we can with the means available to
us," Ickes added, "the basic remedy
rests with Congress. The decision of
the court, in my opinion, emphasizes
the necessity for specific and ade
quate legislation to effectuate the ra
tional conservation program designed
to prevent the waste of oil and gas
resources and to prevent the de
moralization of one of our largest
basic industries."
Discussion Results
The high court's action yesterday
set up a buzz of discussion that con
tinued throughout the capital today.
Two progressive Senate Republicans
who have been most vocal in their
criticisms of NRA —Borah of Idaho
and Nye of North Dakota—had vary
ing reactions to the decision.
Borah commented that the "logi
cal decision would seem clearly to
include the codes of so-called fair
competition" as also unconstitution
al. Nye did not touch on the possible
effect of the decision on NRA, whose
validity, contended Donald R. Rich
berg, recovery co-ordinator, had not
had "a doubt" cast upon it.
Instead, Nye expressed concern
that an oil agreement be accom
plished to "enable the industry to
get away from this frightful com
petition and establish itself on a fair
ti'ade basis."
