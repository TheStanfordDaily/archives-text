The Editor, Sir:
Usually we politely bow to your
editorial opinions, but "tool," sir, is
a horrid word, and we must protest.
The "gentlemen" who made the
protest to you about parking in the
walk between Toyon and Branner
must be a lazy cuss indeed, since
there is room to pass even though a
car is parked on the path, and an
other path is only a few paces away.
If you think it a "toolish" trick to
leave a car for about ten minutes in
front of Toyon, what, sir, would you
say to the fact that on returning to
my car I found all four doors open
(in the rain) and one tire completely
deflated with the valve unscrewed.
Possibly you know that old saw
about "Two wrongs . . At any
rate, I have my ideas about who was
the real "tool" in this instance.
Yours for gentlemanliness,
V. C.
