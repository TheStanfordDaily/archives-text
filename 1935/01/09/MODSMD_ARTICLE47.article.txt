•IMITATION OF LIFE"
At the California Theatre
In reality, "Imitation of Life" is
TWO pictures; one the Hollywood
typical of a woman's (Claudette
Colbert) rise to success only to have
her lover stolen by the daughter for

whom she sac
rificed every
thing, and the
other (ihe really
interesting one)
telling the life
tragedy of the
"nearly - white"
daughter (Fredi

Washington) of Colbert's negro
business partner, who is forced to
watch the white girl's attaining of
friends and established social posi
tion, while in contrast, her color
and education sentence her to a life
of aloneness. The producers have
side-stepped this main issue and at
tempted to subordinate it, but they
fail, even after illogically altering the
Fannie Hurst novel in such a way as
to make the thwarted and rebellious
daughter reaccept her mother's race
after the latter's death.
