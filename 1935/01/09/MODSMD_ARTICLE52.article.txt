Football is over and now basket
ball begins, or rather, basketball will
pet a little more publicity now that
the sports sheets aren't filled with
inches and inches of football mate
rial.
And although basketball is now
the major sport for this season of
the year, it will not come close to
receiving the space that is given over
to the gridiron. Why? We don't
know. But basketball games, at
least on the coast, never draw much
of a crowd. Thirty-five hundred
people would be a big crowd here on
the coast. We have heard of a near
7000 in the southern part of the
.state at one game, but that is the
unusual.
Perhaps one of the reasons for
small attendance is the fact that
there are but a few basketball pa
vilions that will house a large crowd.
Again people might object to the
rough and tumble style of Pacific
Coast Conference play, but then the
football followers should go for that.
Back in the Middle west they play
basketball like it should be played
and consequently play before packed
houses, sometimes numbering mighty
close to 20,000. Here one sees noth
ing of the fellow who takes the ball
at one end of the court and barges
through all opposition to the other
end and then sinks, or most likely
misses, a field goal. Back there it is
a single unit composed of five men,
that work with a finesse that draws
the people to the games.
Some people even go to claim that
there is not enough action in a
basketball game. We wonder, then,
how they can sit through a football
game with its numerous times-out,
penalties, and the- time taken up
by huddles and putting the ball in
play. Basketball is a last game and
the new rules adopted by the Con
ference this year have made it
much faster.
Elimination of the center jump
with the exception of at the start
of each half, and after certain foul
shots, leaves little time for relaxa
tion, on the part of both the player
and spectator.
Friday night in the Pavilion Stan
ford initiates another conference
season, meeting the toughest oppo
sition on the coast, the University
of Southern California, coached by
Sam Berry. Last season* the Tro
jans won the southern half of the
conference and then traveled north
to lose the title to Washington. Some
idea as to their present strength can
be found in their successful barn
storming trip, during which they de
feated Washington by a-good score.
There may be some wonder as to
why the Indians should tackle such
an opponent for their opening game.
John Bunn feels that his team is as
ready for Troy right now as it would
be later in the season. The Cardinals
have eleven games under their belt,
and although their winning column
is n-yt impressive, what they have
gained in experience cannot be de
nied them.
Furthermore, the squad as a whole
is pointing for the two S.C. games
this week-end. They know it is the
biggest hurdle. Once over it, Stan
ford has the best chance for a con
ference title it has had since Bunn
became the Indian coach.
U.C. and U.C.L.A., although not
as formidable as the Trojans, are
tough enough and Stanford will be
forced to extend herself throughout
the entire season.
The first game with the Bears
comes on January 18 at Berkeley and
a win over U.S.C. this week-end
would put the Bunn men right on
top of the pile.
Good luck, Coach Bunn. You have
worked hard for the coveted coast
basketball title and we hope that
this is your year. â€”Duffy
