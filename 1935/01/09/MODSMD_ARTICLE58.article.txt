# REVAMPED QUINT TO OPEN LEAGUE WITH S.C. FRIDAY
## Keith Topping Starts; Will Watch S.C.'s Guttero 
### Mort D'Evelyn 
Stanford's starting line-up in the
conference opened here this Friday
night will be a new combination, a
quintet styled to outdo the quick
breaking, high-scoring game U.S.C
has been showing during practice j
games this year. This was the result
of last night's practice as Coach John j
Bunn sent his squad through a stiff
session stressing man-to-man de
fense.
Essential change in the line-up is
at the center position, where Keith
Topping, on his second day with the
squad and scarcely over Alabama
bruises, starts his third season at tht
pivot post.
Topping's assignment in the com
ing Trojan sdries Will be to handle
Lee "Rubberlegs" Guttero. all
conference center and leading scorer
of last year. Guttero has been doing
most of the scoring for the Trojans
1 his season, and Topping's success
with the ace of the S.C. attack will
be one of the deciding points of
the game.
Arne Anderson and Howell Tur
ner were the forwards on what con
stituted the first string last night.
Both are over 6 feet in height, and
with Topping at center, the Cardi
nal forwards will give away nothing
to the Trojans as far as height and
weight are concerned.
At guard A1 Page and Bryan
"Dinty" Moore have been getting
the first call regularly. Page, who
captained the Indians in most of the
Midwest games, lacks the size of
most varsity guards but is one of the
fastest and the scrappiest men on
the squad.
Moore's knee, which was injured
| three weeks ago, is apparently well
able to stand a full basketball game,
and the smooth floor work of last
| year's frosh captain has played a
large part in the Midwest games.
; The second combination last night
| included Rod Bost and Bill Quade,
| forwards; Ken Nobbs, center; and
! Wytze Gorter and Robin Lindsay,
j guards.
