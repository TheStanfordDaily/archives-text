# Departmental Requisitions For SERA Work Are Due
## 
### 
Departmental requisitions for
work to be done under SERA fundi;
must be turned in as soon as pos
sible, reminds Mrs. Irene Spenner,
student employment director. These
requisitions must state the project
and the names and number of stu
dents needed.
Release cards for this month are
being given out in the Registrar's
office this week. All students must
take them out and file them in the
Accountant's office to get credit for
SERA work done.

Children in Ashevilie, N.C., re
cently exchanged more than 1.000
discarded toys for admission tickets
to a theatre which was collecting
Christmas gifts for distribution to
the poor.
