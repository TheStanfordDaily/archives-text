# CARD GOLF SQUAD HURT BY INJURIES
## 
### 
A dark cloud of gloom descended
on the Stanford golf course yester
day afternoon, the reason being thai
the Stanford golf team, after a very
successful fall quarter, had been
damaged by sickness and other
causes.
Lawson Little, British and Ameri
can champion, has not returned as
yet, though he is expected. He has
been handicapped in his golf due
to injuries he received just before
finals when his car hit a milk truck
on the Bayshore highway.
Jack Hoerner, who upset Little
and blasted Dwyer out of the num
ber one position at the last of fall
quarter, will not return to school
until the spring as he has only one
quarter of school left and prefers to
study spring quarter.
Morse Erskine, who has been on
the team ever since leaving the
ireshman ranks, will be unable to
return due to sickness.
