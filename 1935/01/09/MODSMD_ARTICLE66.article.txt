# REYNOLDS JOINS CARD TRACKMEN

### 
Stanford's shot putting stock took
quite a rise on Angell Field yester
day with the advent of Bob "Horse"
Reynolds from football togs to track
shoes and uniform.
Reynolds, although possessing
little form, managed to put the shot
a distance of 49 feet 10 inches in
practice last year, failing to reach
that mark in the regular meets. How
ever, with practice the big all-
American tackle should develop into
a good weight man.
Claude Callaway, the other Indian
football tackle, was out the previous
night, and will also put the shot.
Fred Williams, another grid star, will
compete in the dashes.
Slinger Dunn, recently returned
from a track cruise around the
world, was out in suit putting the
shot with his former teammates.
Dunn's best mark on the cruise was
51 feet 10 inches. On the entire trip
Dunn fell below 50 feet but once.
With the rain over, the majority of
the track men were out last night,
although the field and track was too
wet for them to get a good workout.
Slrenuous workouts will be held as
soon as the track is dry enough to
run on.
The Indian squad is shaping up
fairly well and from all indications
will put a team on the field much
better in all departments than
seemed possible at the beginning of
practice sessions. Ray Dean and
Warren Dixon, two transfers from
San Mateo J.C., have bolstered the
sprints and mile, respectively.
The freshman track team seems to
be made up of numerous high school
stars and should offer good competi
tion to their opponents.
