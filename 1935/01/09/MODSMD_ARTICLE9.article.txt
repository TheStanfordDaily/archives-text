# NAZIS MOVE TO GAG SAAR ZEAL
## Ten Commandments Guide Hitlerite's Actions 
### 
SAARBRUECKEN, Jan. 8 (/P).â€”
Ten commandments to force im
petuous Hitlerites into iron-bound
silence during the January 13 plebi
scite, thus avoiding wholesale dis
qualification of voters, were laid
down today by Nazi leaders.
The organ of the German Front,
Nazi organization, alarmed by the
disqualification in the preliminary
vote yesterday of an old woman for
remarking, "I was born a German
and will die a German," announced
the regulations.
The first commandment is "Do
not say 'Heil Hitler.' " This phrase
cost hundreds of public servants
their ballots yesterday, under the
rigid regulations laid down by the
governing commission for the con
duct of the plebiscite.
Another warns against speaking
when entering the voting booth and
the last enjoins a quick and silent
departure after the ballot is cast.
Strict adherence to election techni
calities, such as marking and folding
the ballots, was stressed in the other
seven orders.
If the Nazi voters obey, the Sun
day balloting will see the most silent
procession of Hitlerites since the
Reichsfuehrer attained dominance.
A handful of communists today
defied the Saarbruecken police, the
international police, the Nazi munic
ipal government and the troops of
.Great Britain, Italy, Holland and
Sweden when a bailiff attempted to
evict them from the building they
have been using as plebiscite head
quarters.
