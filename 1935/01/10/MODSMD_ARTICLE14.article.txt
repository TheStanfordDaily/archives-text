After a day of silence sororities
and freshmen will resume lelations

the houses for the final rush period.
Invitations were issued yesterday for
dinner dates for tonight and tomor

Bidding, which takes place Satur
day night, is to be carried en in a
new manner this year. Pan-Hellenic
is employing a preferential bidding
system for the first time. After the
final rushing date Friday night, each
sorority will turn in two lists of
women whom they wish to pledge, a
first list and an alternative list.
Between 9:30 and 10:30 o'clock that
same evening rushees will go down
to the offices of the directors of the
various dormitories and write down
their preferences as to the house they
wish to pledge.
A disinterested woman has been
engaged to compare the lists turned
in by the freshmen with those turned
in by the houses. She will write
down the decision as to which house
cach woman may pledge.
The woman will replace the lawyer
who formerly officiated at bidding.
The rushee will get the card at the
director's office ' designated which
house she may join. Cap and Gown
alumnae, as usual, will call for the
pledges and deliver them to the va
rious houses on the Row.
