# WILBUR OPENS WEEKLY TALKS ON VOCATIONS
## Robinson Leads Discussion Of Opportunities For History Majors 
### Annalee Whitmore 
In the first of a series of depart
ment lectures, President Ray Lyman
Wilbur and Professor Edgar E. Rob
inson last night pointed out the vo
cational opportunities afforded by
medicine and history.
Discussing recent trends in the
medical field, President Wilbur cited
the increased range of specialties
during recent years, together with
need for greater preparation. Two
years was considered adequate for
training 30 years ago; today the min
imum is six or seven.
It has been discovered, he con
tinued, that men farthest ahead 15
years after graduation were those
with some specialized intensive
interest.. Thus, a major in history
or psychology may be satisfactory
as well as an A.B. degree in phys
iology or histology.
He stressed the contributions of
laboratory work in the past, and the
present-day trend toward emphasis
on the field of psychology. The med
ical practitioner is now advised to
have a broad knowledge of Social
Sciences, languages (especially Ger
man and French) psychology, and
the ability to express himself easily
and well.
Interest Necessary
Absolutely necessary are a good
mind and body, excellent disposition,
and above all the desire to practice
medicine. A period of general prac
tice is suggested before specializa
tion in all fields but those such as
bacteriology.
"A knowledge of the past is nec
essary to understand the present,"
decided Professor Robinson in his
discussion of the Department of
History.
Satisfactory work in basic fields
and advanced lecture courses, to
gether with seminars in special fields,
are expected for the history major.
Stanford, remarked Robinson, is the
only institution requiring this last
type of work.
Aids in Wide Study
History, although it does not pre
pare directly for a vocation, does
help in many fields. The Stanford
department is interested in prepar
ing teachers and writers of history;
but if the object is immediate finan
cial returrt, it is not the correct field.
A particularly satisfactory meth
od of study is afforded by the In
dependent Study Plan, which
makes possible individual guid
ance. Such courses as those on
Japan, Latin America, the Far
East, and Canada, in addition to
the more common American and
European history, offer a wide
range of interest. Graduate work
is unusually fruitful in this de
partment.
"The thoughtful public," says
Robinson, "is turning more and more
to books interpreting modern life
and situations." Expert instruction,
he added, is afforded by the fact that
the "faculty are men who are inter
preters, who know the history of our
world."

have a broad knowledge of Social
Sciences, languages (especially Ger
man and French) psychology, and
the ability to express himself easily
and well.
Interest Necessary
Absolutely necessary are a good
mind and body, excellent disposition,
and above all the desire to practice
medicine. A period of general prac
tice is suggested before specializa
tion in all fields but those such as
bacteriology.
"A knowledge of the past is nec
essary to understand the present,"
decided Professor Robinson in his
discussion of the Department of
History.
Satisfactory work in basic fields
and advanced lecture courses, to
gether with seminars in special fields,
are expected for the history major.
Stanford, remarked Robinson, is the
only institution requiring this last
type of work.
Aids in Wide Study
History, although it does not pre
pare directly for a vocation, does
help in many fields. The Stanford
department is interested in prepar
ing teachers and writers of history;
but if the object is immediate finan
cial returrt, it is not the correct field.
A particularly satisfactory meth
od of study is afforded by the In
dependent Study Plan, which
makes possible individual guid
ance. Such courses as those on
Japan, Latin America, the Far
East, and Canada, in addition to
the more common American and
European history, offer a wide
range of interest. Graduate work
is unusually fruitful in this de
partment.
"The thoughtful public," says
Robinson, "is turning more and more
to books interpreting modern life
and situations." Expert instruction,
he added, is afforded by the fact that
the "faculty are men who are inter
preters, who know the history of our
world."
In the first of a series of depart
ment lectures, President Ray Lyman
Wilbur and Professor Edgar E. Rob
inson last night pointed out the vo
cational opportunities afforded by
medicine and history.
Discussing recent trends in the
medical field, President Wilbur cited
the increased range of specialties
during recent years, together with
need for greater preparation. Two
years was considered adequate for
training 30 years ago; today the min
imum is six or seven.
It has been discovered, he con
tinued, that men farthest ahead 15
years after graduation were those
with some specialized intensive
interest.. Thus, a major in history
or psychology may be satisfactory
as well as an A.B. degree in phys
iology or histology.
He stressed the contributions of
laboratory work in the past, and the
present-day trend toward emphasis
on the field of psychology. The med
ical practitioner is now advised to
have a broad knowledge of Social
Sciences, languages (especially Ger
man and French) psychology, and
the ability to express himself easily
and well.
