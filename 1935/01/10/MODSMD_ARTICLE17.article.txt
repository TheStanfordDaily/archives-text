# 'Pop' Visits Farm After Good Season at Temple
## By john McClelland 
### 
Glenn S. "Pop" Warner, the "Old
j Fox" of American football, garnered
new laurels by creating a champion
ship grid outfit back at Temple this
' fall, but he still considers Stanford
his home and is back in Palo Alto
; with his backfield coach, Charlie
I Winterburn, to keep him company
i marking time between seasons,
i Warner, member of the all-Amer
| ican football board, yesterday spiked
! all rumors that there are likely to be
j rule changes which will "open up"
college football or change the scoring
| system.
I "I am heartily in favor of rule
! changes which will give more len-
I iency in passing and make the game
j more spectacular, because that is
I what the public wants," Warner said.
I "But the rules committee is a pretty
j conservative bunch of fellows and
I they are satisfied with the way
I things are."
Pro's Open Up
Pop would like to see the rules
governing lateral passes in front of
| the line of scrimmage and forward
| passing behind the line changed.
| Back East, he says, pro football
' teams pull passing stunts that look
like triple plays on a ball field. And
if college football doesn't open up
the pro boys are likely to steal the
crowds.
"I want to congratulate Stanford
and the coaches on the fine showing
the Cards made this season," Warner
1

| said. "And I can't see any reason
why the team shouldn't be just as
| good next season."
Tops Nevers?
Warner likes to talk about his
J great sophomore fullback, Dave
Smukler, these days.
"Smukler was better as a sopho
more than Nevers, and if he im
proves like Ernie did he should prove
to be an even greater player. He's
bigger and faster than Nevers and is
our best kicker, passer, and runner."
About Bones Hamilton, Stanford's
halfback who, after the Rose Bowl
game, was awarded the trophy for
being the most valuable player in
the country, Pop said:
Break for Bones
"Hamilton is undoubtedly a won
derful player. He wasn't considered
for all-American, however, chiefly
because Grayson 'and Moscrip had
had more opportunities to make out
standing plays and because three all-
American places are never awarded
to one school."
Warner thinks many of those
passes Alabama completed New
] Year's Day were due to luck, and he
| also thinks that some of the stuff
Tulane got away with against his
: Owls in the Sugar Bowl was due to
| fortune.
When spring comes, Pop will trek
Pi st again for spring practice. His
team, he says, ought to be as
good, if not better, than this yt nr's.
