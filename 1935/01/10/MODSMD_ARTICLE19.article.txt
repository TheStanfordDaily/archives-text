# Triolo Wins Farm Praise
## 
### 
With a record which will go down
in the annals of Stanford yell leading
history as one of the best, Jimmie
Triolo has completed a major por
tion of his activities as Stanford yell
king and has opened tryouts for men
who will be his successors.
Under Triolo's direction, Ed But
terworth and Dick Stark, assistant
yell leaders, are training aspiring
arm wavers twice a week in the
Pavilion.
Not since the time of Paul Speegle,
'30, has Stanford had a more enthus
iastic, energetic, original, and enter
taining leader of the masses than is
Triolo. His gags are never-ending
and on several occasions the football
crowds near the Stanford looting
section have been as interested in
watching and listening to Triolo as
in watching the Big Red Machine.
It was Triolo who gave Emma the
Owl, beloved mascot of the Benevo
lent Order of the Turtles, to Stan
ford. When Emma was kidnaped in
Los Angeles it was Triolo who helped
obtain Asta the Turtle to take Em
ma's place in the hearts of the Stan
ford rooter.
New styles in yells were also in
troduced by Triolo during the foot
ball season, and several of his new
yells are due to continue as a part of
Stanford's regular repertoire. And
due to Triolo's efforts and ability to
control crowds, Stanford has heard
practically no booing during the
season.
