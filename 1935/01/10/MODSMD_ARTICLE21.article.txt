# Ziegfeld Follies Open In San Francisco Tonight
## 
### 
With this evening's opening of the
Ziegfeld Follies at the Curran The
atre, San Francisco will have a
chance to see its first major revue in
several years, and the only one
booked for this season.
In the cast are Fannie Brice, Wil
lie and Eugene Howard, and a com
pany of 100 persons, including the
celebrated "glorified" girls of Zieg
feld's fame. This is the first time
thai the Follies with its original New
York cast and production has sallied
forth from the larger eastern cities
for a coast to coast tour.
A special train of eleven cars was
required to transport the company
to the coast. The tour will cover 45
states and will have paid out more
than a million dollars for advertis
ing, traveling expenses, salaries, and
royalties.
