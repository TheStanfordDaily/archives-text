# Hauptmann Thrice Called Go-Between As Jafsie Testifies
## Former Bronx Teacher Tells Of Cemetery Meetings To Pay Ransom MISTRIAL CALL DENIED Lindbergh's Eyes Moist As Futile Hunt Retold 
### 
FLEMINGTON, N.J., Jan. 9 (/P).—
Dr. John F. Condon, "Jafsie" of the
Lindbergh kidnaping case, opened
up new pages of that fantastic trag
edy today with a witness stand story
that thrice branded Bruno Richard
Hauptmann as "John," the cemetery
ransom taker.
Firm, almost eager, in his accusa
tion, the 74-year-old former Bronx
teacher told his direct story for two
and a half hours at Hauptmann's
trial and then turned on defense in
quisitors with vigor.
Defense Chided
Again the chiding schoolmaster,
he lectured Edward J. Reilly, chief
of defense counsel, until the portly
lawyer protested he could "take it."
Colonel Lindbergh's eyes were
moist as "Jafsie" told of the futile
hunt for the baby.
Condon told how the coughing
"John" asked if he would "burn" if
the baby were dead; described him
self as "only a go-between," and re
fused to take Dr. Condon to "the
leader," who he said, "would smack
me up."
'John' Quoted
At one point he quoted "John" as
saying:
"Nobody else shall get the baby
but you, and you can put that baby's
arms around Mrs. Lindbergh's
neck."
But the baby already was dead
its body in a shallow grave near the
Sourland home from which it had
been stolen.
At one point Condon's testimony
on cross examination provoked a de
fense call for a mistrial. The motion,
directly the result of an interruption
by Attorney General David T.
Wilentz, was denied quickly by Jus
tice Thomas W. Trenchard.
There was no doubt in the voice
of the tall, white haired scholar as
he shook a pedantic finger and re
peated:
" 'John' is Bruno Richard Haupt
mann!"
Nor did his story falter as he
told of the eerie cemetery trysts that
finally led him to put $50,000 in the
hands of the furtive "John"—Colonel
Charles A. Lindbergh's ransom for
the baby already slain.
