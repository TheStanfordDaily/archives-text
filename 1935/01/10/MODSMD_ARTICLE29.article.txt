A display arranged by the Stan

to show a few of the many uses of
the photolith process of reproduction
is to be seen in the exhibit cases on
the second floor of the library this

In one of the cases is an exhibit of
the necessary steps in reproducing a
piece of work, with explanations ac
companing each illustration. A dis
play of the various types of finished
pieces makes up the other case.
A map of the Stanford campus
made by Edward M. Farmer of the
graphic arts department, with the
color texture applied by hand direct

of the examples of the process being
shown.
A Russian newspaper from the
Hoover War Library is shown with

one-inch "economy enlargement" for
reading with a glass. Many other
objects of interest are included in
the exhibit.
