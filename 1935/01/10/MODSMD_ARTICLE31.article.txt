# Blithering Blunderers, "Board of Equalization"
## 
### 
Current shakeups in tin* State Hoard of
Equalization only go to show that a govern
ing body cannot continue indefinitely to act
with an excess of stupidity the like of which
(iod seldom chooses to inltict on lis here
below. Somewhere, sometime, under this,
democratic form of government we Americans
enjoy, the wrath of the people is certain to
overtake the misguided authorities.
Last year, alter its lifetime of inactivity
and obscurity, the Hoard of Equalization was
given a responsible, man-sized administrative
job, state liquor control. That job it miserably
bungled. Its weak and vacillating attitude
made complete and profound asses of its
members in the eyes of honest, public-minded
California business men.
Instead of attacking and solving the liquor
problem, members of the Hoard seized the
opportunity t<> build up powerful political
machines through the medium of an exten
sive stall' of liquor administrators and sales
tax collectors. These political machines
proved sufficiently powerful to retain all
members of the board in ofliee, except iivthe
Southern California district where a crusad
ing woman fought and won a position.
That woman has apparently united with
the liberal element of the group to override
the ancient politieos who, clinging to the gov
ernmental precepts of the pre-Hooseveltian
era, had been dominant for 2(1 years. Already
S new and intelligent policy has been enun
ciated; already the cumbersome and politi
cally stalled machine has been reduced in
size.
These omens indicate that in the future Ihe
Hoard of Equalization will inject some fore
sight and ingenuity into Ibis difficult liquor
control problem, and thereby put an end to
I he shilly-shallying, side-stepping, rail-sitting,
crawfishing approach that has been its chief
characteristic this past year.
