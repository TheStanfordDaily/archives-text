# Castor Oil Cure
## 
### 
There \\';is a good deal of tongue-clucking
in I lie Tailed States last year when il was
learned, through the dubious iiieditini of the
international press, th;it European dietators
were resorting to the hrutish practice of the
castor oil cure lor their political miscreants.
That prize hit of information was never traced
to its source; it was never proven.
Now the tonguc-cluckers hear on fairly
competent authority that a Chicago member
of the bench is indicting the same punish
ment, in lieu of a six-month jail sentence, on
citizens of these t'nited States who have done
nothing more horrendous than imbibing deep
ly of the demon rum.
While the 100 percenters are haranguing
long and loudly about "un-American prac
tices" thev might take time out to investigate
this benign brute in the Windy City. His
name might well be placed on the lists of
"reds and undesirables" whom the 100 per
centers consider eligible for deportation.
Ilerr Hitler's castor oil living squadron
would no doubt find in him a valuable
member.
