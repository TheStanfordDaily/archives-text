When llie curtain goes up tomorrow night
on the t93f> conference basketball season,
Stanford rooters—if thev will can work for
a record in sportsmanship .just :is surely as
the team can work for :i record in number
of games won.
So far this year there has been no booing on
the part of Stanford rooters, thanks princi
pally to the splendid leadership of Veil Leader
.limmy Triolo.
Favorable reaction on Stanford's spirit is
heard both within and outside of the I'ni
versitv. The fhiily Trojan commented edito
rially at the end of the football season on the
friendly relations between S.C. and Stanford.
Tomorrow night these same Trojans will
be our guests on the basketball court. If we
c;in continue last fall's record throughout the
basketball season, Stanford sportsmanship
will once more enjoy a prestige comparable
to that of the I'niversity ;is a whole.
Basketball is the most exciting game on
I lie I'niversity sports calendar. Shrieks and
yells are inevitable ;md add to the enjoyment
<>l the game. Make all the noise you want
but don't boo.
Coach John Hunn does not like it and has
said so more than once, visiting teams do not
like it. officials do not like it, and no Stanford

student, taken individually, approves of it.
So don't let mass hysteria lead us into evil
ways. Awav, Satan!
