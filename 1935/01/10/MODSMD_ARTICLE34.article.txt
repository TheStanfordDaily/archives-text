Napoleon is still front-page news.
American dailies are featuring under prominent
captions the 121-year hidden correspondence of Napo
leon to the Empress Marie Louise, his second wife,
and mother of Napoleon 11.
Professor Albert L. Guerard, author of the book,
"Reflections on the Napoleonic Legend," points out
that a great deal more has been known hitherto of
Napoleon's marriage to the Empress Josephine than of
his romance with the Empress Mai/ie Louise.
Unearthing 318 letters (only eight were known pre
ivously) of Napoleon to Marie Louise represents new
historical documentary evidence of the highest im
portance on the emperor's life. The correspondence
covers the period of 1810 to the empero»'s abdication in
1814, the years both of the zenith and nadir of the
Corsican's career. Napoleon's biographies no doubt will
have to be revised or rewritten in the new flood of
light shed upon many of the most stirring episodes of
his life.
The Austrian Archduke recently offered the let
ters at auction in London where they pro
cured by the French government at a price of
$12,500. Twelve experts on Napoleonic orthogra
phy were summoned by France to authenticate the
correspondence before it was purchased. The tet
ters now repose in the archives of the Bibliolheque
Nationale in Paris.
On January 2, the' French government an
nounced that publication rights of these letters
had been sold to a syndicate, and they are now
being published in all major modern tongues.
The background of these letters is most fascinating.
The Empress Josephine had given Napoleon no heir,
and at the probable instigation of the shrewd Austrian
chancellor, Metternich, who hoped to better the ebbing
fortunes of the Hapsburg house, the match of Napoleon
with the 19-year-old Marie Louise, daughter of Fran
cis I, Emperor of Austria, was engineered. After
divorcing Josephine, the emperor wed Marie Louise
by proxy in Vienna, March 11, 1810, and the bride
then left for Paris.
The emperor was overjoyed when a year later his
wife bore him a son, known to history as Napoleon 11,
who grew up to be "a correct Hapsburg prince"
rather than a Bonaparte. In 1812 Marie Louise accom
panied her husband to Dresden on a state visit of great
eclat. But the ill-fated Russian campaign followed,
and the emperor was buried under an avalanche of
misfortune. He appointed Marie Louise Regent of
France while he was absent on the battlefield.
Professor Guerard states concerning these 1118
letters now being published: "The correspondence
will be a great revelation from a politico-historic
point of view. So far as love was concerned, Napo
leon was quite a bourgeois husband to Marie
Louise, and I do not think the romance was at all
a passionate one. Napoleon, however, had more
contidence in Marie Louise than in Josephine.
"France in 1810-14 did not seem to 'take' to
Marie Louise. She was, in the first place, an Aus
trian, of alien race. She spoke French with diffi
culty and was strange to French ways. People
felt she was dull and futile. In addition, she was
the niece of Marie Antoinette who had been guil
lotined only a few years before. These factors cast
a sinister shadow about her. Hardly anyone spoke
a good word for her. We will understand her very
much better through these 318 letters."
Upon reading the serialized correspondence of
Napoleon with Marie Louise the question naturally
arises: Why do our great metropolitan dailies play up
these letters as they do? The explanation of this
übiquitous American admiration for the great em
peror-soldier lies in the American psyche itself,
according to Professor Guerard, who says in his book:
"This persistent fondness for the soldier exists
in a marked degree in America, the least militar
istic of all great nations. There are certain traits
in Napoleon that appeal particularly to the west
ern world, because they are, or seem to be, typical
of its own youthful and energetic civilization. What
America admires in Napoleon is the typical
American.
"We admire the commercial magnate all the
more for his having started as an office boy.
Napoleon is the type of the self-made man. We
love to sec _a man of the people rise by sheer
strength of purpose, stand among those effete
lords and kings of the old countries, and teach them
their places. Napoleon is the greatest of all par
venus. and America is proud of being a parvenu
among nations."
On May 5, 1821, on the isle of St. Helena, death
quieted forever the restless spirit of Napoleon. But
the "serried battalions of Napoleonic literature"—to
use Professor Guerard's phrase—and the Napoleonic
legend, march on triumphantly.
