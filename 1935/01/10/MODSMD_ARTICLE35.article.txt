The Chinese cook claims that there is a certain chap
lain who teaches a certain course who is an "old, old
man with an old, old pipe."
If it keeps raining, and The Daily writes editorials
on the weather, then Lagunita Hall will be filled up.
Lagunita's a lovely dorm
But some of de gals
Are a little "off form."
—Exchange (not Foreign, nor
Money and Banking)
If it keeps raining, and The Daily writes editorials
on the weather, then I will be filled up. The campus
may become saturated, but it is nothing compared to
the Stanford men who went south for the Rose Bowl
game and "sponged off" of their relatives on New
Year's Eve. (This has nothing to do with baths.) —
Exchange.
Hashers are a philosophic race. When drying silver
ware, it may be noticed they stand a long ways away
from the drawer, and throw the knives, forks, and
spoons from this position, making great clanging noises.
One veteran hasher explained that he did it this way
so that the utensils would have a chance to dry off
while traveling through the air.
Hashers trust in God and Evaporation.
If it keeps raining, and The Daily writes editorials
on the weather, then Jupiter, Pluvius, and The Daily
will be completely exhausted. There are some icono
clastic (not speaking of Iconclast. 55, Elementary Icon)
souls who would fervidly wish that the Row would be
all washed up. (This has nothing to do with baths.)
If the roof of the house keeps leaking on my bed, I'm
going to tear the dripping place apart, I am.
There are 30 or 40 legacies for each house this year.
Required reading in the sororities from now on is
going to be Margaret Sanger or the Agricultural Ad
justment Act might offer some suggestions.
If it keeps raining, and The Daily writes editorials
on tho weather, then I presume it will keep raining
and The Daily will write editorials on the weather.
