PECK'S BAD BOY"'
At the Varsity Theatre
The purity cycle brings us yet an
other idealization of small town life.
This one suffers because it:; people
are types, rather than individuals,
with the exception of Peck's Bad
Boy. Jackie Cooper in this role is

remarkably nat
ural, and hi s
performs nee
? evokes sympathy
and gives to the
film what ever
interest it pos
sesses. He plays
an orphan whom

an avaricious aunt separaies from
his adopted father that she may put
her own boy (Jackie Searl) in his
place. The scene in which Searl in
forms Cooper that he is not Peck's
natural son is memorable, a master
piece of its kind. Thomas Meighan
returns to the screen as Peck, and
he again demonstrates his inability
to act, to get beneath a role, to be
anybody but himself on the screen.
"We're Rich Again," the second
feature, is a trite, but occasionally
humorous, comedy. Such expert
funsters as Edna May Oliver, who
now plays polo, and that deliciously
droll woman, Billie Burke, are wast
ed in a hopeless story about a re
cently impoverished family.
