# BULL SESSION
## THE 						DILEMMA HAS HORNS 
### 
The "older" generation is funny,
fnd not only because it is the "older"
generation. It is not funny because
it plunged us into war, into debt,
into depression; for that is really
quite sad. It is not funny because it
once wore bustles, and danced tho
two-step instead of the Carioca; for
that is forgiven and almost forgotten
The "older" generation is funny be
cause it is so confused about what it.
expects from the "younger" gen
eration.
In general, oldsters have three dif
ferent views of the "young people."
When the younger generation is lik«■
the older generation was 20 years
ago, it is "thoughtless" and "wild."
When the younger generation is like
the older generation is now? it is "in
spiring" and "the hope of the fu
ture." When the younger generation
is entirely different from the older
generation, it is—to quote the sage—
"saph^aded."
Although they will never fcdmit it,
most of those who new occupy the
positions of adults in society desire
us to grow up to be what they are. 1

If you get them in a corner and turn
the light in their eyes, they will red
den and tell you they are for prog
ress. But sale in the gray and watery
recesses of their convolutions lies
the conViction that ihey have done
right, and that what they have
achieved should be emulated.
Because most adults will not ad
mit this, a general ferment exists
among the "young." On one hand
they are urged to think for them
selves, to be leaders and not sheep.
If they are entirely listless, the moan
is that the race is headed downhill.
But if they come out with something
"new," they are "young puppies'
who had better learn better. Young
men and women have found to their
dismay that they are really "good"
only when they speak in platitudes,
and act in line with chambers of
commerce, and the giants of business
and society.
That situation i.s bad. Of some it
makes outcasts; of others neurotics;
and of most it makes custom-built
Boys and Girls, who will carry-on
—and that is all.

generation. It is not funny because
it plunged us into war, into debt,
into depression; for that is really
quite sad. It is not funny because it

eration.
In general, oldsters have three dif
ferent views of the "young people."
When the younger generation is lik«■
the older generation was 20 years
ago, it is "thoughtless" and "wild."
When the younger generation is like
the older generation is now? it is "in
spiring" and "the hope of the fu
ture." When the younger generation
is entirely different from the older
generation, it is—to quote the sage—
"saph^aded."
Although they will never fcdmit it,
most of those who new occupy the
positions of adults in society desire
us to grow up to be what they are. 1

If you get them in a corner and turn
the light in their eyes, they will red
den and tell you they are for prog
ress. But sale in the gray and watery
recesses of their convolutions lies
the conViction that ihey have done
right, and that what they have
achieved should be emulated.
Because most adults will not ad
mit this, a general ferment exists
among the "young." On one hand
they are urged to think for them
selves, to be leaders and not sheep.
If they are entirely listless, the moan
is that the race is headed downhill.
But if they come out with something
"new," they are "young puppies'
who had better learn better. Young
men and women have found to their
dismay that they are really "good"
only when they speak in platitudes,
and act in line with chambers of
commerce, and the giants of business
and society.
That situation i.s bad. Of some it
makes outcasts; of others neurotics;
and of most it makes custom-built
