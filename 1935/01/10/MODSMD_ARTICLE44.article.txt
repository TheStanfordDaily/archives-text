| Editor, Sir:
In lack of something better to do
I read the terrifying Bull Session
|in Tuesday's Dippy. It seems as if
the poor old Honor Code is taking a
; beating from another one of our so
i called intellectual giants. The Honor
! Code is classified as a failure on two
j out of three arguments given. It has
J failed (per Bull Session) from both
i an idealistic and a practical stand -
| point because we don't practice all
jwe preach. An ideal is something to
'aspire to. It is a perfection we can
| not hope to attain. It is by trying
j to attain an ideal that we gain and
! not by gaining it.
Bull Session says that the Honor
| Code does not work from a prac
tical standpoint. I have talked the
j matter of cheating over with many
lof my friends, and not one of us
| has ever witnessed a case of the
1 much talked of "cheating." Of course
i it is ridiculous to assume that the
| Honor Code was in any way re-
I sponsible. If Bull Session's class
j mates and friends are such as he
describes, perhaps we cannot blame
[ him for some of the things he writes.
