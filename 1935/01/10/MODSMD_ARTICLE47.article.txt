For a little diversion and plenty
of good clean fun a visit to one of
the varsity rugby games is recom
mended. The first one is going to be
held Saturday on the frosh football
field. There will be others coming
along almost every Saturday after
noon till March.
Kughy on the West Coast has
not yet come to be the highly com
mercialized, life-and-death propo
sition that is the lot of American
football. There is not going to be
a crowd of 7(1,000 people at any of
the games this season, or the next,
or the one following that, and there
will not be any bets running over
two figures on the outcome.
These are reasons why rugby men
look forward to the games, and get
a kick out of them. They aren't go
ing to get dragged over the coals by
thousands of bleacher coaches if they
bobble the ball a couple of times, or
make a bonehead play. Neither the
spectators, the press, or even the
players themselves are always sure
of the rules, but that's just it—it
doesn't matter an awful lot.
Varsity footballers really go for
rugby in a big way. If the more
"important" and publicized sports
like basketball, track, and base
ball weren't interfering, most of
the Rose Bowlers would be gracing
the heavy red shorts and cleats
right now.
They like the freedom of the game.
Id football, it is a series of concen
trated charges, every ounce of effort
going into each play. Then the next
play, and the same charge.
Now in rugby the halts between
''plays" are few and far between,
some "plays" lasting for several
minutes at a time. Each of the 15
men on the team gets his chance to
pass, kick, or run with the ball,
whereas the football lineman is re
signed to his lot of unsung heroism
and back-breaking drudgery.
The chances are that any lack of
interest in rugby which may exist is
because not many people know what
it's all about. Saturday's double
header will give you a chance to
learn. Even if you aren't sure what
a "try" or the "three-quarter line"
i. l by the end of the first game, we're
sure you won't start to leave if some
body says "scrum" in the second.
