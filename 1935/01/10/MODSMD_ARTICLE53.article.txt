# INDIAN HOOPSTERS TRAIN FOR TROJAN WEEK-END GAMES
## League Starts Tomorrow; Team Confident Despite Mid-Western Losses 
### Phil Duffy 
Confident that they have a real
good chance to defeat the highly
touted Trojan quintet this coming
Friday and Saturday nights, the
Stanford hoopsters are working out
strenuously this week.
Coach John Bunn's squad re
cently returned from an eastern
trip on which they played 10
games. Hampered by sickness and
injuries to all but two of the 12,
the Cardinals were successful in
only three games, winning over
Utah, Nebraska, and Creighton.
Two of these wins came during the
last three games of the trip when
ihe squad was almost completely re
covered from sickness. At the peak
of their schedule, when the Indians |
played four games on as many sue- [
cessive nights, the members of the I
team were so bad that Bunn was j
forced to call for volunteers to start.
The majority of games saw the
Cardinals forging to the lead in
the early part and then fading at
the last unable to keep up the pace.
Bunn feels that the Stanford five
at their best could have beaten
anyone on the journey with the
exception of the White Eagle Oil
quintet of Kansas City, who have
i been champions of the City League
i there for the past five years.
Regardless of the losses, Bunn felt
well pleased with the squad as a
1 whole and can discern a marked im
provement in the Indian defense and
team work. Bfyan Moore, who
i nursed an injured knee at the start
' of the journey, proved to be the star
of the last few games, scoring as high
i as 12 points.
Kenneth Nobs showed up well 3t
center while Kenneth Bell was laid
up for most of the trip with a bad
I ear. Hal Turner and Rod Bo.st proved
the best mainstays at the forward
i positions with Arne Anderson com

i ing in for his share of the work.
! A1 Page,' Wytze Gorter, and Bill
Quade also played stellar ball.
Keith Topping, rugged center who
began practice this week, has been
in first string position in practice
sessions and will in all likelihood
start the U.S.C. game. Topping will j

add much to the Indian attack, and
it in good condition should prove a
worthy foe of Lee Guttero, a 11-con
ference center on the Troy team.

male auto drivers than any other
j country in the world.

played four games on as many sue- [
cessive nights, the members of the I
team were so bad that Bunn was j
forced to call for volunteers to start.
The majority of games saw the
Cardinals forging to the lead in
the early part and then fading at
the last unable to keep up the pace.
Bunn feels that the Stanford five
at their best could have beaten
anyone on the journey with the
exception of the White Eagle Oil
quintet of Kansas City, who have
i been champions of the City League
i there for the past five years.
Regardless of the losses, Bunn felt
well pleased with the squad as a
1 whole and can discern a marked im
provement in the Indian defense and
team work. Bfyan Moore, who
i nursed an injured knee at the start
' of the journey, proved to be the star
of the last few games, scoring as high
i as 12 points.
Kenneth Nobs showed up well 3t
center while Kenneth Bell was laid
up for most of the trip with a bad
I ear. Hal Turner and Rod Bo.st proved
the best mainstays at the forward
i positions with Arne Anderson com

i ing in for his share of the work.
! A1 Page,' Wytze Gorter, and Bill
Quade also played stellar ball.
Keith Topping, rugged center who
began practice this week, has been
in first string position in practice
sessions and will in all likelihood
start the U.S.C. game. Topping will j

add much to the Indian attack, and
it in good condition should prove a
worthy foe of Lee Guttero, a 11-con
ference center on the Troy team.
The United States has more fe
male auto drivers than any other
j country in the world.
Confident that they have a real
good chance to defeat the highly
touted Trojan quintet this coming
Friday and Saturday nights, the
Stanford hoopsters are working out
strenuously this week.
Coach John Bunn's squad re
cently returned from an eastern
trip on which they played 10
games. Hampered by sickness and
injuries to all but two of the 12,
the Cardinals were successful in
only three games, winning over
Utah, Nebraska, and Creighton.
Two of these wins came during the
last three games of the trip when
ihe squad was almost completely re
covered from sickness. At the peak
of their schedule, when the Indians |
played four games on as many sue- [
cessive nights, the members of the I
team were so bad that Bunn was j
forced to call for volunteers to start.
