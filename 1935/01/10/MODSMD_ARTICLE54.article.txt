# Swim Team Faces Ten Inter-collegiate Meets
## 
### 
Led by Captain Bob Foster, some
23 veteran and sophomore Card
swimmers splashed into Encina pools
early this week beginning intensive
workouts for winter competition
which will see the Indians in action
in ten inter-collegiate meets.
Coach Nort Thornton looks on his i
'35 aggregation as being slightly less
formidable than last year's but still
good enough to clean every team on
the coast with the possible exception .
of a great Trojan team. Stanford
has not lost an inter-collegiate meet
since 1917, Norton says, and he is
hopeful that the record will not be
broken within the next three months. ,
The tentative schedule as it now
stands includes an inter-class meet
on January 24, meets with Golden
Gate Jaysee, Lakeside Swimming
Club, U.S.C., U.C.L.A., and San Jose !
State in February; a meet with Cali
fornia, the Northern California
A.A.U. meet, the Pacific Coast Con
ference meet at Los Angeles, all in
March; and the Northern California
inter-collegiate championships, and
the fourth annual Stanford relays in
| April. I
Thornton's present line-up, while
I not as good as last season, is still i

strong. Foster, who holds the Amer- j
ican record for the 440 breast stroke j
and the Pacific Association and 1
Northern California championships, J
is the prospective high point man. |
Milton Friednu ">, winner of the
i Stanford-Cai diving meet test year,'
i promises to be in even better form
i this season.
Jimmy Triolo, who two years ago \
was chosen an all-American in
, 220 and 440 dashes, may be out ol
! competition as he was last winter i
Most of the candidates are sopho
i mores and juniors who have yet to
prove their ability.
Turning out for the sprints are '
Alec MacKenzie, Walter Doyle, Mar- i
tin Scatera, Don Petit, Sud Suther- !
land, Jack Kuhn, and Pierson Dean, i
Out for the quarter are Don Peter- j
son and Bill Clemo. For the 220j |
1 Jack Kuhn, Peterson, Clemo, and (
Bob Hoover.

i diving ranks. Those out for back- j
