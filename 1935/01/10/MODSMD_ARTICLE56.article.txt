WASHINGTON, Jan. 9 Re- i
newal of the practice of sending con
gressional missions to Hawaii to |
study conditions there was .seen as
probable today by Delegate King, j
following a long conference with
Representative Green of Florida,
chairman of the Territories Commit
tee.
King said Green suggested Con
gress might see fit to send a mis- '
sion to the Islands next summer in j
view of the vigorous complaints and J
misunderstandings that arose as the j
result of legislation in the 73rd .ses
sion. Green has plans to make the I
trip this year.
