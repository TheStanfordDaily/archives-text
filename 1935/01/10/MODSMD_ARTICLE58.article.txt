## 
### 
As a result of firing conducted last
quarter, 19 members of the Stan
ford R.O.T.C. qualified in pistol
marksmanship, according to orders
issued recently by the local military
department. Two men, George
Downing and Hamilton Lawrence,
won, by virtue of scores of 86 and
85.9, respectively, out of a possible
100, the rating of expert, which is
the highest normal marksmanship
award that the army recognizes.
In the next highest classification
of sharpshooter, the local unit quali
fied four. A score of at least 78 is
necessary to obtain this award, ac
cording to Captain S. F. Miller, who
conducted the firing as a part of the
First Year Advanced Course cur
riculum of the R.O.T.C. program.
John Morse, John Coffin, Don
Smith, and John Steelquist shot
sharpshooter scores.
In the lowest qualification of
marksman, which requires a total of
GO points, 13 men were placed. By
scores ranging from 7(5.3 to G0.5, the
following were listed in the order as
qualified marksmen: Richard Becker,
Robert Ranzoni, Charles Baird,
Edward Hinkle, Robert Jenkins,
Robert Morris, John Waller, Peter
van Loben Sels, Richard Bibbero,
Arthur Lundin, Francis Holman,
Charles Thomas, and John Gill.
It was said that the course fired,
in which the regular army .45 Colt
was used, was one regularly used
by dismounted troops of the army.
Army marksmanship medals for
each of the three classifications will
be issued to the R.O.T.C. men, Cap
tain Miller said.
A better record with the pistol was
made this year than is usual due to
the limited time and ammunition
available for the work, according to
Lt. Col. D. C. Cubbison.
