# DAILY ANNOUNCES TWO CHANGES IN CARRIER SERVICE
## 
### 
The Circulation Department
of the Daily announces a re
adjustment of routes.
Because of the large num
ber of students now living in
College Terrace, Mayfield, the
Daily's carrier service will be
extended to that district.
In order to effect this exten
sion, the Daily will be forced to
discontinue carrier service in
that part of Palo Alto which
lies north of Guinda Street.
The students who live north of
Guinda Street, and who will be
deprived of carrier service by
the readjustment, will have
their papers left for them at
the Bookstore.
The change will be effective
Friday morning, January 11.
