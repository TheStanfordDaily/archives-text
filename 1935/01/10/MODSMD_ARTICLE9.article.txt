# Old Boy Stacks Old Cards; Deals From Cold Deck
## 
### 
Old discarded Cards will come
back ace-high and with lots of jack,
when Berk Anthony, an old Old
Boy of Chaparral, returns to the
hearts and firesides of his many ad
mirers with a tale of life and love:
"Popular Falacies Concerning Stan
ford" in the "Old Timers" number.
Berserk Berk will illustrate his
machination with illustrations and,
possibly, pictures.
Wallace Irwin, a Stanford power of
'00 who got too far behind the throne,
will have his famous poem printed
in regard to his equally famous grad
uation from Stanford. .
Dan Mendelowitz, graphic artist,
has contributed an unpornographic
cover for the old timers.
