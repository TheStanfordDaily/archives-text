# EXPERTS STUDY BRUNO'S NOTES IN 'LINDY' CASE
## Condon Finishes Testimony After Long Battle With Defense Counsel CASE MOVES FORWARD Court Rules Hand-Writing Is Worthy Evidence 
### 
FLEMINGTON, N.J., Jan. 10 (IP).—
The state of New Jersey marshalled
a battery of hand-writing experts
tonight in its attempt to prove Bruno
Richard Hauptmann guilty of kid
naping and killing baby Charles A.
Lindbergh, Jr.
The attack swung in this direction
shortly after Dr. John F. (Jafsie)
Condon, hoary-headed ransom nego
tiator, stepped wearily from the wit
ness stand late today, tired but still
unshaken in his identification of
Hauptmann as the ransom receiver.
Call Experts
Tonight, with samples of the
blooding Bronx carpenter's hand
writing definitely admitted as evi
dence over bitter protests, Haupt
mann's counsel rallied quickly to
line up a counter-attack for this new
onslaught.
"We'll have all the hand-writing
experts who are willing to testify
for nothing," Edward J. Reilly, chief
of defense counsel, has grimly pro
claimed, "when they're needed.''
Policeman Testifies
But today it was the state, quickly
following up the stern finger-poinl
ing of the aged "Jafsie," which
sought to consolidate the testimony
ag;nn.st the chalk-visaged Haupt
mann witlv hand-writing exhibits. It
charged they compared with the
ransom notes—notes which led Colo
nel lindbergh to pay $.10,000 for the
"safe return" of the golden-haired
little son he was never to see alive
again.
Opening gun in the state's intro
duction of handwriting standards,
Corporal William F. Horn of th?
state polite took the stand to identify
a statement he said Hauptmann
wrote voluntarily in the Greenwich
police station, New York.
