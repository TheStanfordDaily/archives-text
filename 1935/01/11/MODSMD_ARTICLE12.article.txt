# Stuart Anticipates Pro-Hitler Saar Vote
## Political Science Professor Describes Experiences In Saarbruecken 
### John McClelland 
When the people of the Saar re- '
gion of Europe go to the polLs Sun- ;
day to decide their future political |
destiny, the vote should be 75 to 85 !
per cent for German union, 15 to 25 j
per cent for status quo and less than j
5 per cent for French union.
This is the prediction of Political
i Science Professor Graham Stuart,
| who recently returned to the United
States after making extensive studies
of diplomatic and consular proce
| dures in Europe.
Hitlerites Have Control
Stuart feels sure that France has
n't a chance, that the status quo ad
; vocates are a small minority, and
! that the Hitlerites with their usual j
' strong arm efficiency, have things;
very well in hand.
In a report sent from tlje east !
coast, where he is now visiting, |
; Stuart cites the reasons v/hy the;
I Saar will go German by such a big I
majority. He was in Saarbruecken j
! on the eve of "a great German polit- j
I ical demonstration" which the Nazis i
' handled with Kingfish-like efficiency, j
Crowds Excitcd
"Excitement was in the air," Stu- j
art said, "and the streets were ablaze j
| with innumerable electric lights, j
Great red banners and flags with the I
I black swastika floated in profusion |
! from the buildings. Speeches were j
; made. The people turned out by the i
! tens of thousands, shouting 'Zuruck !
zu Deutschland!'" And the Nazis j
stood grimly by nodding approval,
j Hitler, according to Stuart, went j
! out after the Saar in a big way, 1
| using true American methods of "en- j
i terprise." The French, and the Com- j
, munists and Jews who want to con- j
( tinue the status quo were simply j
I overwhelmed. The great Adolph
made it quite evident that it would
j be to the advantage of the "Saar
folk" to vote for German alliance,
j and the people have more than
I shown their willingness to comply.
Propaganda Ilifc
j Stuart also cites the war of press j
I propaganda typically represented by j
mast head mottoes in rival papers:, j
j "For Christ and Hitler" in a pro- |
j Nazi publication, and "Christ Is Our j
j Leader, not Hitler" in a pro status ;
j quo organ.
| There is also the psychological fac- '
| tor which favors Germany. The ;
I people know the vote is bound to be j
; pro-German and, naturally wanting
to be on the winning side, will join
i in to make the swing to the Deutsch- j
j land a literal landslide.
