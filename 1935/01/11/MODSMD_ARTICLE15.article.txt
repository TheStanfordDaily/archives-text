# Spiritualism Studied on Farm

### 
Because Thomas Welton Stanford, t
Leland Stanford's wealthy and un
usual brother, was annoyed at being ;
unable to prove whether or not an j
I Australian spiritualist was a fake,
Stanford is one of the few univer
sities in the world with a division of ;
psychical research.
Thomas Welton Stanford, through
various gifts and bequests, left an i
endowment of some $650,000 for a I
chair in psychical research and psy- j
chology. Spiritualistic phenomena :
1 were, scientifically speaking, "be
yond the pale"—considered unwor
thy of study by the true scientist.
' Because of this, the University had
| trouble in finding a man to fill the i
j chair. Finally, in 1912, John Edgar!
j Coover, who had just taken his doc
' tor's degree in psychology here at |
Stanford, accepted the position. He j
was to devote part of his time to
] psychical research, the rest to psy-J

chology. The arrangement has sur
vived to this day.
Before the University was
founded, Senator and Mrs. Stan
ford attended seances in Boston.
When the division of psychical re
search was founded, San Francisco
reporters interviewed the Boston
medium who had later moved to
Cupertino. The medium said that
the Stanfords had received the in
spiration for the University from
conversations with their dead son
in seances.
This untruth, coupled with a false
conception by many people that the
endowment was to promote the
cause of spiritualism, has caused the
University to keep a tight lid clamp
ed on publicity about the division
and its activities.
The results of Dr. Coover's work
were published in a monograph en
titled "Experiments in Psychical Kc

t search at Stanford University."
! Summed up, they tended to prove
1 that telepathy, at least in normal
i people, did not exist. Neither is there
I anything to "the feeling of being J
J stared at." Certain other experi- i
j ments had shown the effect of trie
mind in hearing -causing it to make ,
I sense from anything indistinctly
heard. Nonsense syllables were
| spoken in one room. An auditor on
the other side of a closed door j
thought he heard sensible words.
! Other experiments proved further
the unreliability of evidence. But as
for the existence or nonexistence of i
| ghosts, nothing had been attempted.
Dr. Coover's favorite topic, next
the psychical research, is "What is
I it that makes a student learn?" |
He devotes most of his spare time
to finding out, and has devised a
unique test for what he calls "in -
j tcllectual curiosity" — a test for \

which he is locally famous.
His test is simply a set of "catch
questions." Without letting his
classes know what ihe point is, he
Rives them the same set. of questions
several times during the quarter.
Those who have "intellectual curios
ity" will look up the correct an
swers; others will continue to guess
at them.
Here's a typical question: Suppose
the earth to be a perfect circle at
the equator, 25,000 miles in diam
eter. Suppose also that there is
placed around it a steel hand which
exactly tils it. Then splice into ihe
steel band a section 18 feet long and
again make it a perfect circle. Will
the resulting clearance betweon the
band and the earth be enough to
slip a piece of paper through? Will
it be enough to slip your hand
through. Will it he enough for a
man to crawl under?
