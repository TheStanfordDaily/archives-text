# Yell Leader Trial Today
## 
### 
As their final service to the Stan
ford student body, the members of
the Rally Committee will meet to
day to act as judges in the yell
leader tryoutee contest. The com
mittee members will choose six of
the 13 candidates in the competition
held at 1:15 o'clock today in the
Pavilion.
The six men chosen today will be
the candidates for the position of
assistant yell leader in the student
body election next month.
The balloting today will be based
strictly upon the ability of the can
didates. To insure fairness, the can
didates will be voted on by number
rather than by name. Each man will
lead two yells. The tryouts are
under the direction of Jim Triolo.
