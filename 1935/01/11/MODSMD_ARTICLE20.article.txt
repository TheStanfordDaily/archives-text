# Revenue Sought From Income Tax Proposal
## 
### 
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 10 (If).â€”
State income tax proposals made
their first appearance in the Legis
lature today as members of both
houses turned their attention to this
type of levy as a new revenue source
for the state.
Most significant of the proposals
was the bill introduced by Senator
Andrew R. Schottky of Merced,
which would provide for a levy of
one-third of the amount assessed by
the federal government. State and
municipal employees would not be
exempted from payment of the state
tax.
