## Gubernatorial Campaign Is Hit by Mitchel Saadi In Walrus Club Meet 
### John McClelland 
Using material gathered in an ex
tensive study of the recent Califor
nia gubernatorial campaign, Mitchel
Saadi, graduate student now in the
Hoover War Library, last evening
turned a Walrus Club "Propaganda"
| discussion into a semi-public expose
| of the fantastic methods used by the
I Merriam and Sinclair forces to mold
j the public to their wills for political
j purposes.
For 40 minutes Saadi kept his au
dience of some 50 students and fac
i ulty members at gleeful attention as
he pointed out the motives behind
j the U.C.L.A. Communist scare, th?
press-created Communist threat in
i San Francisco, Merriam's reasons for
i putting through the $20,000,000 un
employment relief program, and the
j graphic war-time method appeals of
j the Merriam forces to the public's
I emotions.
Saadi explained how Merriam
postponed calling out the militia in
' the longshoremen's strike because of
| fear of losing the labor support and
how the press united with their well
known Communist propaganda to
turn the public against the strikers.
Governor Flayed
| "Merriam held off calling out the
militia," Saadi said, "until the big
! shots promised him political support.
Later in his campaign he saw the
need of gaining back the labor sT.jp
â€¢ port and put through the unemploy
! ment relief program. But Merriam.
was forced to take this action be
cause the federal government threat
ened to cut the state off without a
dime of relief money unless the state
itself voted relief money. Merriam,
therefore, reluctantly called the leg-
I islature back from their vacations
I and put through the program in the
| name of 'aiding the unemployed.' "
Displays Posters
Saadi punctuated his talk with
, frequent displays of gaudy posters
; used by Merriam forces to excite the
! people against Sinclair. He told how
propaganda stories used in the East
I were printed word for word as per
| taining to California "because they
had worked well in one place and
should work in another."
He showed the posters exhibiting
| Sinclair as advocating "free love,"
! "The protector of the home and jobs"
and as "The enemy of the church."
He told how Hearst kept out of the
battle until two weeks bflfbre the
| election and thereby gained great
advertising revenue advantages over
| rival papers.
All this Saadi used as explaining
! the use of propaganda in political
I campaigns.
Professor Strong Speakj,
First speaker on the Walrus Club
program was Psychology Professor
! Edward K. Strong, who also talked
! on propaganda, explaining the dif
| ference between advertising and out
I and out propaganda.
He illustrated how neither of the
I two necessarily incited action; rather
j tending to point out a line of action
! which would satisfy certain desires.
1 Strong declared that advertising did
i n't require proof, using as an ex
! ample "a young man in love."
"Others may see defects in the
young lady," he said, "but the young
man is not interested. He wants no
proof. So it is with advertising and
I propaganda."
