# Youth Is Interested In the Next Few Years
## 
### 
The young America which, deservedly or
not, was indiscreet enough to earn the derision
implied in the epithet oi "Flaming Youth'' is
no more. It has long ago gone, its way, re
placed hy the children of the depression, du
bious, dissatisfied creatures who perhaps feel
their responsibility too keenly.
As a class this youth has been less favored
under our new conception of paternalistic
government than any American group. Ex
perience believes, no doubt, that the young
and the strong can protect themselves, can
light their own battles, provide, their own
food and shelter, marry and raise children
by the standards they have known on sixty,
seventy, eighty dollars a month when and if
they can get it.
This winter in America there is much talk
of old :ige pensions, and attention is particiir
larlv focused on the Townsend plan, the
ollspring of an aged Southern California ama
teur economist.
While the government is considering 'S2OO
a month pensions for the old—who are inlinn
in body and no longer able to enjoy it, who
are.-tired in mind and no longer have /.est for
it, whose children are grown and self-susr
laining, who have had their lling ;it life in an
easier, perhaps better age let it also turn to
Ihe youl'h of the land.
Young men and women, bullied by the bio
logical. social, and financial* incompatibility
of this world, are the ones who need the pen
sions. Let them be free, free to study, free to
male as nature meant them, free to jest and
play and labor their just share, to own their
homes, make their families, enjoy their
friends. Let tlieni have freedom to line!
The youth of America is at present a dis
illusioned, but not yet a discouraged youth.
We believe it, more than our old, needs aid
and redemption, for it is on youth, not age,
that America's future rests, (live it a chance,
and it will succeed.
