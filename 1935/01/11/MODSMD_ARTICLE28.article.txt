# Dr. Munro and His Alternatives
## 
### 
Ably expressing I he thoughtful, sober point
of view of many eonservative thinkers, Dr.
William IJ. Munro in his talk yesterday eon-
I ributed a sincere, st i 111 u I a t i iil; :;malysis of
what he ehooses to cadi the "New Politics. 5 *
Dr. Munro believes that as a long-run propo
sition, we must elutose between the democratic
rule of the people, with all the liberties as
we 11 as uncertainties which that involves, and
a sort of benevolent dictatorship which would
guarantee economic security at the expense
ol much ol' the freedom that we now enjoy.
He believes thai a democratic form of govern
ment is not suited lo a high degree of control
over business since il must change 100 fre
quently, thus sacrificing continuity. Govern
ment without continuity is not efficient
enough to assume such a burden, he points
out.
Thus, according to Dr. Munro, we are faced
with a devil's choice. II we are to keep our
democratic form of government, wo must ac
cept all the chaos and confusion of uncon
trolled private initiative . with the booming
prosperity thai il brings and the devastating
depressions that follow in its wake. Implied
acceptance ol I his alternative is involved in
I lie speaker's admonition that we must resign
ourselves to a slow process of recovery.
Meeovery will come when il will come as
even the most ardent New Dealer is about
ready to admit. While that long, long corner
is being rounded, it seems not impertinent lo
suggest thai we might he doing something lo
palch up the battered old machine of capi
talism to make il run better once il gels
started again. If can be done, many believe,
without succumbing to either of the alterna
tives that Dr. Munro suggests.
Thoughtfully considered, intelligent legis
lation can be passed within Ihe framework of
the Constitution that will endure through any
Adminislration, regardless of parly. The evils
of private initiative can be curtailed still fur
ther even as Ihev have been lo a certain exlcnl

in the past. The ultimate ellict will be* more,
not less, freedom lor the* average man.
This the New Deal seeks to accomplish,
placing reform ahead of recovery whether il
admits il or not. II it succeeds in ils ultimate
objectives, then political scientists will have
to revise their theories. II it fails, then con
servative savants will probably be faced with
au entirely new lonn of to talk
about. Or perhaps we will back In the old
regime. That does not seem likely, however,
wilh the Longs, the Sinclairs, and the Cough
lins abroad in the land.
Because things have been done in a certain
way iu the past does not mean that the same
process will continue in the future. Still less
does it mean that il should continue. History
tenches many things and one of them is that
history is not an infallible guide.
