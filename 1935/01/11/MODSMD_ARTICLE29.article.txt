### CEDRIC LARSON 
WITH GEORGE W. DOWRIE
President Roosevelt's budgetary message to Con
gress of this week wound up on the same old tremolo
note of deficit.
The chief executive asked for a lump sum ap
propriation of $4,000,000,000 in the 1936 fiscal year
starting July 1 next to substitute work relief for
the dole. No recommendations for increased taxes
were made. The deficit for the fiscal year of 103G
will reach a total of $4.528,000-,000, of which sum
$636,000,000 will be used for debt retirement.
Regular federal expenditures for the fiscal year
1934 totalled $2,462,000,000; in 1935 (including estimated
disbursements until July 1) $2,748,000,000; and in 1930
$3,302,000,000. These figures do not include recovery
and relief expenditures, The national debt will jump
from about $31,000,000,000 as of July 1, 1935, to a new
high of $34,239,000,000 a year from lhat date. The
deficit must be met with loans floated* from American
banks for the most part.
How far can the credit of the United States be
stretched, with year after year 6f accumulating deficit?
Can the treasury, the federal reserve and private banks
maintain the prolonged strain on their already over
taxed resources?
Dr. George W. Dowrie of the Graduate School of
Business, makes the following observations on this
topic:
"Thus far the credit of the United States has re
mained in excellent condition. The huge loans
needed to meet the excess of expenditures over
receipts from taxes have been heavily oversub
scribed. in spite of the low rate of interest offered.
True, the banks have taken about 85 per cent of
these loans, but with the heavy increase in funds
available for loans and investments and the lack
of demand on the part of the public for accom
modation at banks, government bonds were the
logical media for putting funds to work.
"More than a year and a half ago, Congress author
ized the President to employ several methods .of
inflating prices. In the meantime, in addition, large
stocks of silver have been purchased and nearly three
billions of gold acquired from the devaluation of the
dollar. This furnishes the basis for an enormous expan
sion of credit. i,
"All of these moves have kept the conservative
element in our population in a state of fear lest wie
drift into an orgy of inflation similar to that which
prevailed in Germany after the war. The fact is that
the administration has made little use of these infla
tionary measures. The longer it refrains from doing
so the less likelihood there is of its employing them.
"Last January 31, the devaluation of the dollar was
stopped and has not. been resumed. While no definite
promise has been made that no further monetary ex
periments will be tried, the fact that restrictions on
foreign exchange transactions were removed recently
indicates that the administration intends to leave the
dollar as it is.
"The condition of our banks has improved
steadily during 1934. Instead of the several thou
sand failures a year which characterized the earlier
years of the depression tbe number of bank failures
has decreased to a mere handful and in most of
them the depositors were protected by the new
deposit insurance system. One striking bit of evi
dence as to the growth in confidence in banks is
the increase in deposits of privately owned banks
to tbe extent of 22 per eent, during the past year,
while poslal savings declined 37.7 per cent."
Despite the deficit for the fiscal year 1936, it would
seem that the federal government is at least holding
its own when relief measures are not counted in, that
there is much confidence in government securities in
Ihe money world, and that although the financial
upward .surge may not be rapid, there is no basis for
gloom.

WITH GEORGE W. DOWRIE
President Roosevelt's budgetary message to Con
gress of this week wound up on the same old tremolo
note of deficit.
The chief executive asked for a lump sum ap
propriation of $4,000,000,000 in the 1936 fiscal year
starting July 1 next to substitute work relief for
the dole. No recommendations for increased taxes
were made. The deficit for the fiscal year of 103G
will reach a total of $4.528,000-,000, of which sum
$636,000,000 will be used for debt retirement.
Regular federal expenditures for the fiscal year
1934 totalled $2,462,000,000; in 1935 (including estimated
disbursements until July 1) $2,748,000,000; and in 1930
$3,302,000,000. These figures do not include recovery
and relief expenditures, The national debt will jump
from about $31,000,000,000 as of July 1, 1935, to a new
high of $34,239,000,000 a year from lhat date. The
deficit must be met with loans floated* from American
banks for the most part.
How far can the credit of the United States be
stretched, with year after year 6f accumulating deficit?
Can the treasury, the federal reserve and private banks
maintain the prolonged strain on their already over
taxed resources?
Dr. George W. Dowrie of the Graduate School of
Business, makes the following observations on this
topic:
"Thus far the credit of the United States has re
mained in excellent condition. The huge loans
needed to meet the excess of expenditures over
receipts from taxes have been heavily oversub
scribed. in spite of the low rate of interest offered.
True, the banks have taken about 85 per cent of
these loans, but with the heavy increase in funds
available for loans and investments and the lack
of demand on the part of the public for accom
modation at banks, government bonds were the
logical media for putting funds to work.
"More than a year and a half ago, Congress author
ized the President to employ several methods .of
inflating prices. In the meantime, in addition, large
stocks of silver have been purchased and nearly three
billions of gold acquired from the devaluation of the
dollar. This furnishes the basis for an enormous expan
sion of credit. i,
"All of these moves have kept the conservative
element in our population in a state of fear lest wie
drift into an orgy of inflation similar to that which
prevailed in Germany after the war. The fact is that
the administration has made little use of these infla
tionary measures. The longer it refrains from doing
so the less likelihood there is of its employing them.
"Last January 31, the devaluation of the dollar was
stopped and has not. been resumed. While no definite
promise has been made that no further monetary ex
periments will be tried, the fact that restrictions on
foreign exchange transactions were removed recently
indicates that the administration intends to leave the
dollar as it is.
"The condition of our banks has improved
steadily during 1934. Instead of the several thou
sand failures a year which characterized the earlier
years of the depression tbe number of bank failures
has decreased to a mere handful and in most of
them the depositors were protected by the new
deposit insurance system. One striking bit of evi
dence as to the growth in confidence in banks is
the increase in deposits of privately owned banks
to tbe extent of 22 per eent, during the past year,
while poslal savings declined 37.7 per cent."
Despite the deficit for the fiscal year 1936, it would
seem that the federal government is at least holding
its own when relief measures are not counted in, that
there is much confidence in government securities in
Ihe money world, and that although the financial
upward .surge may not be rapid, there is no basis for
