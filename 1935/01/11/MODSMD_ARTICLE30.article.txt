# OUR HASHER SEZ:

### 
Hong, the second boy, wishes we to say, "Hello," to
everybody fox* him.
Wednesday was supposed to be the "Day of Silence"
in sorority rushing. It was about as quiet as Jimmy
Durante blowing his nose, or Pagan's "Unseen Hand"
shelling peanuts.
The hashers, those, stalwart, uncombed gentlemen
of the frowzy cuff, have made a few butches during
rushing so far. Everybody says that Crary (recently
connected with the Chi O's and the Kappas but no'v
dribbling for the Alpha Phi's) pulled some tremendous
mistake, but Crary refuses to talk, and the Alpha Phi's
won't breathe a word. They breathe in sentences, do
these Alpha Phi's. The Pi Phi hashers got lost in a
fog. It seems that the girls were singing one of those
sweet, chiruppy little ditties about "Get h Pi Phi
arrow, and you'll have a lot of beaus, if you'll string
along with us," or something. There came a break in
the xnusic. "Chirrup, chirrup," came the lilting reed
like notes from the kitchen. The hashers, who had
been singing along with the women, got the bird.
As "Our Hasher" (the darling of the regimexif)
prophesied, most of the terrific errors have been made
by the women themselves. The Chi O's thought thar
everyone had left as 8 o'clock came around. In their
long, flowing formals, they started frisking about, run
ning up and down stairs and shouting in true lady
like, Chi Omega, national standing manner. They
discovered, with horror, however, that the innocent,
uplifted faces of several Robleites were watching them.
The pay-off came, though, at the local chapter house
of Kappa Kappa Gamma. Something went wrong
with the gas in the kitchen. The beautiful souffle in
the kitchen went flat, the eook muttered implications,
and the hashers laid in a stock of apples, crackers,
and bread in preparation for a long winter. The result
was that the Kappas and their rushces (no ticker no
rushee) ate only salad and pie that noon. After th"
girls had put away from them the desire lor meat and
drink, the meeting was hastily adjourned. Many
Kappas dashed to the cellar for sustenance, and tlior",
ahead of them, they saw the girls they had just been
feeding, trying to stave off the pangs of hunger.

like notes from the kitchen. The hashers, who had
been singing along with the women, got the bird.
As "Our Hasher" (the darling of the regimexif)
prophesied, most of the terrific errors have been made
by the women themselves. The Chi O's thought thar
everyone had left as 8 o'clock came around. In their
long, flowing formals, they started frisking about, run
ning up and down stairs and shouting in true lady
like, Chi Omega, national standing manner. They
discovered, with horror, however, that the innocent,
uplifted faces of several Robleites were watching them.
The pay-off came, though, at the local chapter house
of Kappa Kappa Gamma. Something went wrong
with the gas in the kitchen. The beautiful souffle in
the kitchen went flat, the eook muttered implications,
and the hashers laid in a stock of apples, crackers,
and bread in preparation for a long winter. The result
was that the Kappas and their rushces (no ticker no
rushee) ate only salad and pie that noon. After th"
girls had put away from them the desire lor meat and
drink, the meeting was hastily adjourned. Many
Kappas dashed to the cellar for sustenance, and tlior",
ahead of them, they saw the girls they had just been
feeding, trying to stave off the pangs of hunger.
Hong, the second boy, wishes we to say, "Hello," to
everybody fox* him.
Wednesday was supposed to be the "Day of Silence"
in sorority rushing. It was about as quiet as Jimmy
Durante blowing his nose, or Pagan's "Unseen Hand"
shelling peanuts.
The hashers, those, stalwart, uncombed gentlemen
of the frowzy cuff, have made a few butches during
rushing so far. Everybody says that Crary (recently
connected with the Chi O's and the Kappas but no'v
dribbling for the Alpha Phi's) pulled some tremendous
mistake, but Crary refuses to talk, and the Alpha Phi's
won't breathe a word. They breathe in sentences, do
these Alpha Phi's. The Pi Phi hashers got lost in a
fog. It seems that the girls were singing one of those
sweet, chiruppy little ditties about "Get h Pi Phi
arrow, and you'll have a lot of beaus, if you'll string
along with us," or something. There came a break in
the xnusic. "Chirrup, chirrup," came the lilting reed
like notes from the kitchen. The hashers, who had
been singing along with the women, got the bird.
