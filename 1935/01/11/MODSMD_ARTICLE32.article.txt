# BULL SESSION
## A 						BAN ON "ECSTASY" 
### 
Once again America has been |
saved. In the hour of gx'eatest peril, i
the Legion of Decency—like, a Whit?
plumed knight of old—has rushed in '
and rescued Miss America from a!
fdte worse, far worse, than death.
Led by A1 Smith—that "Happy War
rior" in the fight for personal liberty
—the forces of good have succeeded 1
in barring the European film "Ecs
tasy" from entrance into the United
States.
"Ecstasy" is the picture which!
threatened a European war, a rift |
between II Duce and the Vatican, and !
even now is a potential menace to j
the moral foundations of world civi
lization. "Ecstasy" shows what ii~
said to be the beautiful body of
Hedy Kiesler without sartorial coin- 1
plications. And that is apparently
too much for
"The land of truth and freedom
Beyond the ocean bars
Where the air is full of sunlight
And the flag is full of stars."
A cynic might say that behind the !
banning of the film lay a carefully j
planned conspiracy of American j
nudists to keep out foreign compe- \
tition. A field pre-empted by Sally
Rand and dedicated to the glories of ,
Faith Bacon has no room for a
Czechoslovakian girl, the wife of
one of those insidious merchants of
death. In an age of high tariff pro
tection for everything from corn
removers to pancake flour, that might
not be a bad reason for keeping Hedy ;
in hiding. Would that that were the
reason.

| "Ecstasy" is out because many ;
I people still believe that "What you
don't know won't hurt you." Such j
' devotees of the cult of ignorance
! credit the masses with no imagina- ■
tion or even morbid curiosity. That
\ is the group which had made the -j
' "stork" a family institution, and
1 relegatecv intelligent birth-control !
literature to the darkness and filth
of back alleys.
Unfortunately, it is 'especially j
those things "you don't -know" that j
Ido the hurt. If you can "know"' a j
1 thing, you have at least a fighting
| chance of doing something about it.
But those things you don't know
about, and continue to exist despite ,
your ignorance — are the cause of
! some of our worst evils:
Disease; too many dumb babies; !
getting stuck with Peruvian bonds, |
quack remedies for the Depression j
i (e.g., remove trade barriers by
; dredging New York harbor) — all
'these and more may.he chalked to
i the score of those who ?mile, simply |
and tell you that ignorance is bliss, j
"Ecstasy" would probably not j
I contribute greatly to the uplift of,
I mankind. Its suppression is posi- j
| tively detrimental.

rior" in the fight for personal liberty

in barring the European film "Ecs
tasy" from entrance into the United

threatened a European war, a rift |

even now is a potential menace to j
the moral foundations of world civi
lization. "Ecstasy" shows what ii~
said to be the beautiful body of
Hedy Kiesler without sartorial coin- 1
plications. And that is apparently
too much for
"The land of truth and freedom
Beyond the ocean bars
Where the air is full of sunlight
And the flag is full of stars."
A cynic might say that behind the !
banning of the film lay a carefully j
planned conspiracy of American j
nudists to keep out foreign compe- \
tition. A field pre-empted by Sally
Rand and dedicated to the glories of ,
Faith Bacon has no room for a
Czechoslovakian girl, the wife of
one of those insidious merchants of
death. In an age of high tariff pro
tection for everything from corn
removers to pancake flour, that might
not be a bad reason for keeping Hedy ;
in hiding. Would that that were the
reason.

I people still believe that "What you
don't know won't hurt you." Such j
' devotees of the cult of ignorance

\ is the group which had made the -j
' "stork" a family institution, and
1 relegatecv intelligent birth-control !
literature to the darkness and filth
of back alleys.
Unfortunately, it is 'especially j
those things "you don't -know" that j
Ido the hurt. If you can "know"' a j
1 thing, you have at least a fighting
