402 pages.
No phase of American politics in |
J all it.s sundry manifestations is more j
fascinating than a cartographical j
| analysis of the presidential ballot i
over th(! last four decades. Professor i
| Edgar Eugene Robinson, history do- j
I partment head, has made such a
study in his recently published vol
ume listed above.
! The basis of the book vests upon
j lobulation by counties of the presi- i
1 dentin! vote for each of the past ten
j presidential quadrennia. The mag- i
j nitude of the research involved can
i be readily grasped when .we reflect
that it meant canvassing individual j
j county electoral results from 189ti j
; to 1932, the number of which grew i
\ from 2,738 in the former year to (
3,090 in the latter. Ten full-page i
I . i
j cartography of the United States il- !
lustrate these data.
Of the 1932 presidential election, '
| Professor Robinson observes in this I;
book: "It w&s the Republican admin - |
Jstration that had to carry the bur- i
I den of discontent and dissatisfaction j
| always to be expected in time of I
. financial depression and economic |
uncertainty. Moreover, Hoover was j
himself the candidate, and had to
; defend his record of performance, as
well as the program of the Repub- j
lican party.
"His opponent. Franklin D. Roose- j
; yelt, was not so widely known as >■
Smith had been in 1928. but the ut- j
terances of Roosevelt made appeal to j
some of the same elements of the j
population that had supported Smith j
four years before.
"Moreover, the Democrats wove I.
united as they had not been in 1928,
1 and more so than they had been at
any time in this period, while the .
Republican candidate was not sup
ported by many of the more promi
nent Republicans and violently op
i posed by others, in particular by a ;
i number of senators who had fought
him throughout his administration
and whose national reputatio'. made

their opposition of considerable im
portance."
Franklin D. Roosevelt won the
support of 22,809,638 voters and
Herbert Hoover had 15.758,901 voles,
which was 742,732 more than had
been cast for Smith in 1928. Roose
velt carried 2,721 counties and Hoo
ver 372. Roosevelt obtained 472
electoral votes (42 states), and Hoo
ver 51 electoral votes (6 states).

No phase of American politics in |
J all it.s sundry manifestations is more j
fascinating than a cartographical j
| analysis of the presidential ballot i
over th(! last four decades. Professor i
| Edgar Eugene Robinson, history do- j
I partment head, has made such a
study in his recently published vol
ume listed above.
! The basis of the book vests upon
j lobulation by counties of the presi- i
1 dentin! vote for each of the past ten
j presidential quadrennia. The mag- i
j nitude of the research involved can
i be readily grasped when .we reflect
that it meant canvassing individual j
j county electoral results from 189ti j
; to 1932, the number of which grew i
\ from 2,738 in the former year to (
3,090 in the latter. Ten full-page i
I . i
j cartography of the United States il- !
lustrate these data.
Of the 1932 presidential election, '
| Professor Robinson observes in this I;
book: "It w&s the Republican admin - |
Jstration that had to carry the bur- i
I den of discontent and dissatisfaction j
| always to be expected in time of I
. financial depression and economic |
uncertainty. Moreover, Hoover was j
himself the candidate, and had to
; defend his record of performance, as
well as the program of the Repub- j
lican party.
"His opponent. Franklin D. Roose- j
; yelt, was not so widely known as >■
Smith had been in 1928. but the ut- j
terances of Roosevelt made appeal to j
some of the same elements of the j
population that had supported Smith j
four years before.
"Moreover, the Democrats wove I.
united as they had not been in 1928,
1 and more so than they had been at
any time in this period, while the .
Republican candidate was not sup
ported by many of the more promi
nent Republicans and violently op
i posed by others, in particular by a ;
i number of senators who had fought
him throughout his administration
and whose national reputatio'. made

their opposition of considerable im
portance."
Franklin D. Roosevelt won the
support of 22,809,638 voters and
Herbert Hoover had 15.758,901 voles,
which was 742,732 more than had
been cast for Smith in 1928. Roose
velt carried 2,721 counties and Hoo
ver 372. Roosevelt obtained 472
electoral votes (42 states), and Hoo
ver 51 electoral votes (6 states).
