The Editor, Sir:
We've all seen dog shows, but
where a better one than the present )
session of the Stanford Sorority Ken- .
nel Club?
On one side we have big dogs, lit
tle dogs, medium dogs, curly dogs,'
red-lipped dogs, blue-eyed dogs,
blue-dispositioned dogs, beautiful
dogs, clever dogs, kind dogs, and
sweet dogs.
On the other side we have judges,
judges interested in looks, judges of
disposition, judges of prestige (for
mer winners), judges of walk (we
all know the model), judges of pedi
gree (sired by Von Millionnaire).
As the judges confer and confer,
and the dogs display and display,
what waste of feminine and canine
energy goes on.
But will the girls, like good dogs,
continue to wag their tails in friend
ship whether they win a ribbon or
not?
