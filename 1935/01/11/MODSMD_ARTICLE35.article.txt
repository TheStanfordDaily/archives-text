The Editor, Sir: »
You asked to have a discussion of
the Stanford Theatre to be. Before
we decide when the theatre is to be
built, don't you think we should de
cide what kind of a building it is
to be?
Could you tell us how, many peo
ple the new theatre w.ill hold? Is it
true that the dressing rooms, will be
placed below the stase. and that, the

lighting facilities in tnese dressing
rooms will be very poor?
And what is this I hear about plans
to have the box office and entrance
to the theatre in front of the stage?
As I am helping to pay for the
building, I trust that these questions
are not too impertinent.
Sincerely,
M. L. S.
