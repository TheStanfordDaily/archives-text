# MUNRO'S LECTURE
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
It was with great expectations that
many of us went to Dr. Munro's talk
in yesterday's assembly. But our ex
pectations appeared too high. We
were led to anticipate some glean
ings from the thought of a broad
minded scholar. We found that it is
still possible for an expert to be lim
ited by his specialization. Dr. Munro
stated unequivocally that the present
depression did not differ from past
ones in any fundamental aspect.
How fundamental is the# closing of
the Western frontier, the end of free
land for colonial expansion, the bur
den of war debt on the whole world,
the fact that a majority of cur popu
lation is now urban, the world ex
tent of the depression except for the
existence of a Communist state in
world affairs—that we have a satu
rated market, relative to buying
power, instead of a rapidly Expand
ing, hungry one? Then, to imply that
a planned economy necessitates the
regimentation of. labor is unscholar
ly. To say that wd are disappointed
is generous. Is this another apology
fpr the dear departed?
