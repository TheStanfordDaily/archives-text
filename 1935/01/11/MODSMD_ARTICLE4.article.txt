## Women Accept Last Dinner Engagements Tonight 
### 
Rumors that certain sororities
were planning to pledge more than
their recommended quota of rush
ees were effectively killed last night
when Pan-Hellenic chief's reached an
agreement with said houses. The
nature of the compromise was not
revealed.
Dinner dates tonight bring to a
close the third and final rushing pe
riod. Under the new preferential

bidding system, rushees, after re
turning to their respective halls lol
lowing dinnei-, w ; ll prepare to turn
in a list of their preferences. They
will do this in the offices of the
halls' directors between 9:30 and
10:30 o'clock tonight.
Meanwhile, the nine sororities
will turn in two lists of women
whom they wish to pledge, a first
list and an alternate list. Tomorrow
these lists will be compared with
the rushees' cards. Rushees will
learn the decision in the offices of
the directors tomorrow night. As in
previous years, Cap and Gown
alumnae will deliver the pledges to
the various houses on the Row.
