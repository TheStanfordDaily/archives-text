# Fire Department Pumps Water from Encina Hall
## 
### 
Because of heavy rains during the
past week the campus fire depart
ment found it necessary to pump a
level of approximately one foot of
water from the basement of Encina
Hall last night.
Little damage, however, was
caused by the flood as it did not
enter any of the students' room. The
firemen were called at 6 o'clock and
continued to work for two hours
with pumps. Rainstorms in previous
years have caused similar floods in
the Encina basement.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 10 (/P). â€”
Secretary Ickes, the oil administra
tor, asserted today that production
of oil in the East Texas field was
being held up with the hope of
avoiding federal legislation.
