# ODDS AND ENDS

Well, Marvie's back. Now every
thing can go on as usual.

The impending climax of men's j
rushing brings up the story, true,
too (or vice versa), which went the
rounds a couple of years ago con- ;
ceming one of the local chapters. j
This fraternity is inhabited for the j
most part by rather large gentle- ;
men. There was one young fresh ;
which the house wanted most of "all j
to pledge. But one of the few small j
men was against him, and refused j
to give in.
Finally, one of the larger be- :
hemoths got up, calmly put his
smaller brother to sleep with a j
well-directed hay-maker to his
jaw, and when the latter awoke— j
a new pledge was being congratu- I
lated.
Women's rushing begins to look!
more and more like that of the fra- j
ternities. This time of the year al- I
ways brings out stories of dirty work
by this and that. It's been rumored i
(so?) that one of the strong local 1
chapters had its class picked and i
lined up last fall before school ever
started. That's doing the enthusiastic
fraternity one better, if it is only j
true.
Shades of Will Hays. Dramatic !
Manager Dick Frank was quoted j

iii The Daily as saying that the
slightly risque scene in "Her
Master's Voice" has been elimi
nated by having the hero sit on
the foot of the bed. Thus is saved
the virginal Stanford mind.
Nevertheless, "Her Master's Voice"
should be a pretty fair production.
Bud Wilson, who plays the leading
male part, reminds one somewhat of
Roger Pryor, who played the role op
posite Billie Burke in Henry Duf
fy's Hollywood show.
What's become of the brilliant
white rain capes that used to blos
som out with every shower?
