# Sick List Unalarming, Says Dr. T. A. Storey
## 
### 
"He's in the hospital," or "She's in
the rest home," are common expla
nations of why some favorite friend
is not at class. The long "sick list" I
in the Daily each day speaks for it - !
self. But why are there so many i
sick students?
There is nothing to be alarmed
about, Dr. T. A. Storey of Stanford
i explains. "In January after the holi
i days there is always an increase : n
illness," he points out.
It is not due to the strenuous activ- 1
ities of the Christmas time, either, he
further tells us, for there is always
an increase in respiratory illness at i
| this season of the year, not only
here, but all over the country. Chi- I
cago, New York, and Boston are
| having inflated sick lists, too.
i "When our students go to their j
homes during the holidays they be- I
, come more exposed. They come j
' back and bring their colds with!
them. Then, too, he reminds us,
there are more students this quarter.
