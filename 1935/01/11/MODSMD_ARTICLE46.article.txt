newcomers. .
Reisner To Stay
For the first game of the season
the Card line-ups are still in a nebu
lous state. The football-playing
members of the team are still trying
to snatch a little rest and recupera
tion after the New Year's tussle, but
Johnny Reisner, Jack Walton, Joe
Yigna, and Fred Abbott will prob

come out as yet, but is going to as
soon as his injured ribs get better.
In the three-quarter line, the rug
by backfield will be Reisner, Vigna,
Abbott, George Fuller, Otto Bans
bach, Aylett Cotton, and Sam Cock
ins. Reisner will be at one flank,
ready to advance the ball fpr his
usual long jaunts.

be led by Captain Roger Hager, Wal
ton, George Wyman, Dick Becker,
Primo Pinotti, Frank Ingersoll, and

a number of new and untired men,
from whom several will be picked to
join first team ranks.

2:30 o'clock and will last till 3:45,
when the first team game will start.
