# Monetary Activities Await Supreme Court Decision
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 10 (VP). â€”
The Supreme Court was virtually
ready tonight to begin formulating
a momentous decision on the con
stitutionality of key phases of the
Roosevelt monetary program.
Leaning forward across the high
mahogany bench of their severely
furnished courtroom, the nine jus
tices today heard attacks upon the
government's monetary activilies as
a breach of solemn contract, and in
turn heard government counsel
plead that they render a decision
which would "not defeat the early
return of prosperity."
