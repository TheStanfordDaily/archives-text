# BIG POLO TURNOUT GIVES PROMISE OF BETTER SHOWING
## Busy Season of Competition Is Promised Squad By Lieut. Grubbs 
### 
Continued rains this week have
kept a good turnout of varsity polo
ists indoors, so that the regular
inter-squad practice game scheduled
for this afternoon has been called
off, according to Lt. Haydon Y.
Grubbs. An important meeting of
the A squad will be held, however,
at 4:30 o'clock this afternoon and all
concerned are urged by Coach
Grubbs to be present.
With the exception of the loss of
Captain Luppe Luppen and Cal
Emeis through autumn quarter
graduation, there has been a very
satisfactory turnout for this quar
ter's activities, it was said. Luppen
and Emeis will be greatly missed in
the Stanford line-up hereafter.
The former has been a first-string
member of the team for several years,
while Emeis played excellent polo as
the team's principal substitute and
saw considerable service in recent
contests. Prospects look good for an
improved showing from now on, Lt.
Grubbs believes. Three members of
last year's championship quartet are
still available in the persons of Bill
Rogers, Russ Rasmussen, and Bob
Fullerton, as well as some very ex
cellent former reserves, including
Jim Henderson, Ralph Beal, Biil
Enemark, and o'thers.
A busy season of competition is
being arranged by Lt. Grubbs, and
several important and interesting
contests will be played on Ibe
home field instead of elsewhere, as
was the case last quarter. A re
turn series with the University of
Arizona Wildcats, who upset the
Card outfit in two games in Tu
scon last month, is being planned
for the Easter holidays, it was
said.
For the near future, in fact as soon
as the Highway Field dries off suffi
ciently to permit play, a game has
been arranged with the well-known
San Mateo Polo Club quartet lead
by Will Tevis. This outfit has the
reputation of being one of the strong
est in this area. In fact, San Mateo
last year scored one of the two de
feats the Cards suffered all season.
