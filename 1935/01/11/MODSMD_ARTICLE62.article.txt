# Indians Tackle Trojans in Cage Season Opener
## UNTRIED REDMEN BRANDED LEAGUE'S 'DARK HORSE' TEAM Three Probable Starters To Play in Their First Conference Game 
### 
Tonight in the Pavilion at 8 o'clock
Coach Bunn will send his 1935 Car
dinal quintet, the conference "dark
horse," against Sam Barry's Univer
sity of Southern California five, fa
vorites for the Coast crown, in the
first of a two-game series this week
end.
U.S.C. has an All-American center
in Lee Guttero, winners of All-Coast
mention in Captain Joe Kelley and
Ernie Holbrook, and an enviable
practice record.
New Combination
Stanford has a newly found com
bination, with three of the probable
starters yet to play conference bas
ketball, a post - conference record
which consists of eight losses and
three wins, and the unenviable rep
utation gained over a period of long
standing of being the "weak sister"
of conference basketball.

Not to be measured is the spirit
of determination that has marked
the play of the Card varsity during
practice this past week and the ob
vious improvement which the In
dians made during their Midwest
trip. There is more . speed, more
teamwork, than any Stanford five
has shown in the past number of
years. Finally, the squad has a feel
ing that they are a match for the
Trojans no matter what the rest of
the sport world thinks. Bunn and
the squad know that tradition pro
hibits predicting a Stanford victory
over U.S.C. in basketball, but are
fully confident that they will be a
surprise to all.
Topping Adds Spirit
Part of this spirit of rising confi
dence is due to the almost phe
nomenal way in which Keith Top
ping has taken hold of the hoop
game after being less than two weeks
out of a football suit. Topping's size
and experience should give the Card
quintet a needed steadiness and rug
gedness. Ken Nobbs, who did most
of the center play on the barnstorm
ing trip, may get the starting call,
but Topping is certain to play con
siderable basketball in the series.
At forwards will be Howell Tur
ner, high scorer of last year's but
twice defeated frosh, and either Arne
Anderson or Rod Bost. Anderson
has the advantage of size and ex
perience over Bost, but the latter
has distinguished himself with a
smooth floor game and has held
down the first string post in most of
the games to date.
Guards Are Small
Guards will be A1 Page, a two
year veteran, and Bryan "Dinty"
Moore, captain of last year's frosh.
Both will give away considerable
physical advantage to the Trojan
guards, but are important cogs in
the Card passing offense.
Facing the Indians will be a five
which has already proven itself
the leading contender for the sec
ond successive conference title.
Center Guttero looms to repeat
high scoring honors for the con
ference. Hoi brook is a tried for
ward who returned to old-time
form, so the southern scribes say,
last week when the Trojans upset a
great Universal Pictures pro five,
by a score of 45-25, after dropping
two previous tilts to that team.
Jack Hupp, a soph, will hold down
the other forward post while Cap
tain Joe Kelley and Hop Findley will
start at guard.
Troy Has New Ace
In spite of this enviable and tried
lineup, U.S.C. is bringing to the
Farm an "ace-in-the-hole" in Eddie
Oram, sophomore guard, who will
trade off with Findley. Oram was
given credit for the Trojan upset
over the Universal five, during
which contest he put the damper on
the play of Lubin and Hyatt, two
professionals who gained All-Amer
ieal honors during their collegiate
days.
The probable starting line-ups:
Stanford—Turner and Anderson or
Bost, forwards; Nobs or Topping,
center; and Page and Moore, guards.

vious improvement which the In
dians made during their Midwest
trip. There is more . speed, more
teamwork, than any Stanford five
has shown in the past number of
years. Finally, the squad has a feel
ing that they are a match for the
Trojans no matter what the rest of
the sport world thinks. Bunn and
the squad know that tradition pro
hibits predicting a Stanford victory
over U.S.C. in basketball, but are
fully confident that they will be a
surprise to all.
Topping Adds Spirit
Part of this spirit of rising confi
dence is due to the almost phe
nomenal way in which Keith Top
ping has taken hold of the hoop
game after being less than two weeks
out of a football suit. Topping's size
and experience should give the Card
quintet a needed steadiness and rug
gedness. Ken Nobbs, who did most
of the center play on the barnstorm
ing trip, may get the starting call,
but Topping is certain to play con
siderable basketball in the series.
At forwards will be Howell Tur
ner, high scorer of last year's but
twice defeated frosh, and either Arne
Anderson or Rod Bost. Anderson
has the advantage of size and ex
perience over Bost, but the latter
has distinguished himself with a
smooth floor game and has held
down the first string post in most of
the games to date.
Guards Are Small
Guards will be A1 Page, a two
year veteran, and Bryan "Dinty"
Moore, captain of last year's frosh.
Both will give away considerable
physical advantage to the Trojan
guards, but are important cogs in
the Card passing offense.
Facing the Indians will be a five
which has already proven itself
the leading contender for the sec
ond successive conference title.
Center Guttero looms to repeat
high scoring honors for the con
ference. Hoi brook is a tried for
ward who returned to old-time
form, so the southern scribes say,
last week when the Trojans upset a
great Universal Pictures pro five,
by a score of 45-25, after dropping
two previous tilts to that team.
Jack Hupp, a soph, will hold down
the other forward post while Cap
tain Joe Kelley and Hop Findley will
start at guard.
Troy Has New Ace
In spite of this enviable and tried
lineup, U.S.C. is bringing to the
Farm an "ace-in-the-hole" in Eddie
Oram, sophomore guard, who will
trade off with Findley. Oram was
given credit for the Trojan upset
over the Universal five, during
which contest he put the damper on
the play of Lubin and Hyatt, two
professionals who gained All-Amer
ieal honors during their collegiate
days.
The probable starting line-ups:
Stanford—Turner and Anderson or
Bost, forwards; Nobs or Topping,
center; and Page and Moore, guards.
Tonight in the Pavilion at 8 o'clock
Coach Bunn will send his 1935 Car
dinal quintet, the conference "dark
horse," against Sam Barry's Univer
sity of Southern California five, fa
vorites for the Coast crown, in the
first of a two-game series this week
end.
U.S.C. has an All-American center
in Lee Guttero, winners of All-Coast
mention in Captain Joe Kelley and
Ernie Holbrook, and an enviable
practice record.
New Combination
Stanford has a newly found com
bination, with three of the probable
starters yet to play conference bas
ketball, a post - conference record
which consists of eight losses and
three wins, and the unenviable rep
utation gained over a period of long
standing of being the "weak sister"
of conference basketball.

Not to be measured is the spirit
of determination that has marked
the play of the Card varsity during
practice this past week and the ob
vious improvement which the In
dians made during their Midwest
trip. There is more . speed, more
teamwork, than any Stanford five
