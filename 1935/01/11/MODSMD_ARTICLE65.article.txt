j DIDN'T QUITE GET
INTO HALL OF FAME
Stanford's 1934 football team bor
i dered on greatness from time to
1 time, but never quite reached the
! pinnacles. The following is not a
column of moaning because the In
j dians finally lost a game, but it is a
: criticism of the whole season; not
! only that but it is a criticism of the
I best season in Stanford history. And
that makes it quite a ticklish matter
| to slap this particular team in the
face.
So, just to indicate that we are
not considering the Rose Bowl beat-
I ing, we will take the season up to
and including the Big Game.
Stanford won all of those games,
except for the tie with Santa Clara,
which was too early in the season
to count very heavily against the
Indians.
So the Cardinals finished the
season as an undefeated team with
quite a reputation on the Coast.
But the Indians kicked—some of
the eastern sports writers and fans
didn't think so much of them, and
they considered it quite an in
( justice.
But consider the record—against
San Francisco University, 3 to 0;
against California, often beaten, 9
to 7; against Santa Clara. 7 to 7.
: All good teams, granted, but not

! quite so well thought of in the East.
! CARDS DIDN'T COME
UP TO ABILITIES
I The whole point is that the Cards,
with the greatest potentialities in
history, came through with one of
I the best records in Stanford's history,
j but did not approach a realization
of their full power, and so their sea
son was just a good third or fourth
rate one, considering the thing from
1 a national standpoint.
i Now for the reasons:
They had some idea they could
crash through the schedule with
nothing but power. And they did
pretty well; in fact, they devel
oped the best power attack in the
game today. But it seems there are
other things to the great Ameri
can game, and Stanford did not do
anything about these.
The Indians thought only of
! sneaking through with victories.
This is an exceptionally good policy,
and brings in conference champion
ships. But it does not make the kind
of record that induces eastern sports
j writers to rate Stanford as No. 1 team
in the country.
| DIDN'T USE ANY
FANCY PLAYS, WHY?
I So Stanford played her straight
power, and it worked. Opposition
was defending only against straight
' power, but it still worked. But why

! didn't the Indians use some fancy,
; plays, not as their main dish, but
] just as a variation to draw enemy ,
defense out and permit their run- j
ing attack to go even better?
j Willi other learns afraid of
passes, laterals, and wide plays,
they would have been tempted to
play a six-man line much of the
time, and this would have been all
Stanford's power needed to look ,
totally impressive during tiO min
utes of every game.
i They didn't have the passes or
! equipment for the frills, you say?
It was the same team that scored on
the mighty Southern California Tro- ,
jans in 1933 on a pass, won the Eig,
Game of that year in the same ;
! manner, and drove S.F.U. crazy dur-
; ing the 1933 tilt with end around#
and laterals.
In the San Jose State game, first of
| 1934, Stanford completed an ex
i actly-timed lateral that gained yards
i and yards, and they looked awfully
! good on this particular type of play
' during earlv-season practice, but
that San Jose game was the last this
writer saw of laterals during the
i year in an actual game.
FORWARD PASSES
FEEBLE ATTEMPTS
Stanford never passed. That is \
rather stretching the point, but is
essentially a fact. Every week the i
team practiced passing long hours; |
then came Saturday with all the !
scribes and headlines saying the i
Cards would take to the air, an 1
those Cards still remained on the
ground.
i Also, Stanford tried many end- j

arounds in practice. Monk Mas
crip is one of the best ball car
riers on a team of ball carriers.
But these end-arounds never ma
terialized during games.
All told, the "passless wonders"
reached their peak for the Washing
ton game, and never approached this
again. It was just after that game
hat everyone was speculating as 10
the prospective greatness of the In
i dian team; but from then on, that
kind of talk dwindled.
They have the same team com
ing back next year. That's why
this little piece. With about eight
months remaining before the start
cf the 1935 season, it is claimed
Stanford has the greatest poten
tiality of any Pacific Coast team
j in history. —Brown

They had some idea they could
crash through the schedule with
nothing but power. And they did
pretty well; in fact, they devel
oped the best power attack in the
game today. But it seems there are
other things to the great Ameri
can game, and Stanford did not do
anything about these.
The Indians thought only of
! sneaking through with victories.
This is an exceptionally good policy,
and brings in conference champion
ships. But it does not make the kind
of record that induces eastern sports
j writers to rate Stanford as No. 1 team
in the country.
| DIDN'T USE ANY
FANCY PLAYS, WHY?
I So Stanford played her straight
power, and it worked. Opposition
was defending only against straight
' power, but it still worked. But why

! didn't the Indians use some fancy,
; plays, not as their main dish, but
] just as a variation to draw enemy ,
defense out and permit their run- j
ing attack to go even better?
j Willi other learns afraid of
passes, laterals, and wide plays,
they would have been tempted to
play a six-man line much of the
time, and this would have been all
Stanford's power needed to look ,
totally impressive during tiO min
utes of every game.
i They didn't have the passes or
! equipment for the frills, you say?
It was the same team that scored on
the mighty Southern California Tro- ,
jans in 1933 on a pass, won the Eig,
Game of that year in the same ;
! manner, and drove S.F.U. crazy dur-
; ing the 1933 tilt with end around#
and laterals.
In the San Jose State game, first of
| 1934, Stanford completed an ex
i actly-timed lateral that gained yards
i and yards, and they looked awfully
! good on this particular type of play
' during earlv-season practice, but
that San Jose game was the last this
writer saw of laterals during the
i year in an actual game.
FORWARD PASSES
FEEBLE ATTEMPTS
Stanford never passed. That is \
rather stretching the point, but is
essentially a fact. Every week the i
team practiced passing long hours; |
then came Saturday with all the !
scribes and headlines saying the i
Cards would take to the air, an 1
those Cards still remained on the
ground.
i Also, Stanford tried many end- j

arounds in practice. Monk Mas
crip is one of the best ball car
riers on a team of ball carriers.
But these end-arounds never ma
terialized during games.
All told, the "passless wonders"
reached their peak for the Washing
ton game, and never approached this
again. It was just after that game
hat everyone was speculating as 10
the prospective greatness of the In
i dian team; but from then on, that
kind of talk dwindled.
They have the same team com
ing back next year. That's why
this little piece. With about eight
months remaining before the start
cf the 1935 season, it is claimed
Stanford has the greatest poten
tiality of any Pacific Coast team
j in history. —Brown
j DIDN'T QUITE GET
INTO HALL OF FAME
Stanford's 1934 football team bor
i dered on greatness from time to
1 time, but never quite reached the
! pinnacles. The following is not a
column of moaning because the In
j dians finally lost a game, but it is a
: criticism of the whole season; not
! only that but it is a criticism of the
I best season in Stanford history. And
that makes it quite a ticklish matter
| to slap this particular team in the
face.
So, just to indicate that we are
not considering the Rose Bowl beat-
I ing, we will take the season up to
and including the Big Game.
Stanford won all of those games,
except for the tie with Santa Clara,
which was too early in the season
to count very heavily against the
Indians.
So the Cardinals finished the
season as an undefeated team with
quite a reputation on the Coast.
But the Indians kicked—some of
the eastern sports writers and fans
didn't think so much of them, and
they considered it quite an in
( justice.
But consider the record—against
San Francisco University, 3 to 0;
against California, often beaten, 9
to 7; against Santa Clara. 7 to 7.
: All good teams, granted, but not

! quite so well thought of in the East.
! CARDS DIDN'T COME

with the greatest potentialities in
history, came through with one of
I the best records in Stanford's history,
j but did not approach a realization

and laterals.
In the San Jose State game, first of

i actly-timed lateral that gained yards
i and yards, and they looked awfully
! good on this particular type of play

that San Jose game was the last this
writer saw of laterals during the
i year in an actual game.
FORWARD PASSES
FEEBLE ATTEMPTS
Stanford never passed. That is \
rather stretching the point, but is
essentially a fact. Every week the i
team practiced passing long hours; |
then came Saturday with all the !
scribes and headlines saying the i
Cards would take to the air, an 1
those Cards still remained on the
ground.
i Also, Stanford tried many end- j

arounds in practice. Monk Mas
crip is one of the best ball car
riers on a team of ball carriers.
But these end-arounds never ma
terialized during games.
All told, the "passless wonders"
reached their peak for the Washing
ton game, and never approached this
again. It was just after that game
hat everyone was speculating as 10
the prospective greatness of the In
i dian team; but from then on, that
kind of talk dwindled.
They have the same team com
ing back next year. That's why
this little piece. With about eight
months remaining before the start
cf the 1935 season, it is claimed
Stanford has the greatest poten
tiality of any Pacific Coast team
j in history. —Brown
j DIDN'T QUITE GET
INTO HALL OF FAME
Stanford's 1934 football team bor
i dered on greatness from time to
1 time, but never quite reached the
! pinnacles. The following is not a
column of moaning because the In
j dians finally lost a game, but it is a
: criticism of the whole season; not
! only that but it is a criticism of the
I best season in Stanford history. And
that makes it quite a ticklish matter
| to slap this particular team in the
face.
So, just to indicate that we are
not considering the Rose Bowl beat-
I ing, we will take the season up to
and including the Big Game.
Stanford won all of those games,
except for the tie with Santa Clara,
which was too early in the season
to count very heavily against the
Indians.
So the Cardinals finished the
season as an undefeated team with
quite a reputation on the Coast.
But the Indians kicked—some of
the eastern sports writers and fans
didn't think so much of them, and
they considered it quite an in
( justice.
But consider the record—against
San Francisco University, 3 to 0;
against California, often beaten, 9
to 7; against Santa Clara. 7 to 7.
: All good teams, granted, but not

! quite so well thought of in the East.
! CARDS DIDN'T COME
UP TO ABILITIES
I The whole point is that the Cards,
with the greatest potentialities in
history, came through with one of
I the best records in Stanford's history,
j but did not approach a realization
of their full power, and so their sea
son was just a good third or fourth
rate one, considering the thing from
1 a national standpoint.
i Now for the reasons:
They had some idea they could
crash through the schedule with
nothing but power. And they did
pretty well; in fact, they devel
oped the best power attack in the
game today. But it seems there are
other things to the great Ameri
can game, and Stanford did not do
anything about these.
The Indians thought only of
! sneaking through with victories.
This is an exceptionally good policy,
and brings in conference champion
ships. But it does not make the kind
of record that induces eastern sports
j writers to rate Stanford as No. 1 team
in the country.
| DIDN'T USE ANY
FANCY PLAYS, WHY?
I So Stanford played her straight
power, and it worked. Opposition
was defending only against straight
' power, but it still worked. But why

! didn't the Indians use some fancy,
; plays, not as their main dish, but
] just as a variation to draw enemy ,
defense out and permit their run- j
ing attack to go even better?
j Willi other learns afraid of
passes, laterals, and wide plays,
they would have been tempted to
play a six-man line much of the
time, and this would have been all
Stanford's power needed to look ,
totally impressive during tiO min
utes of every game.
i They didn't have the passes or
! equipment for the frills, you say?
It was the same team that scored on
the mighty Southern California Tro- ,
jans in 1933 on a pass, won the Eig,
Game of that year in the same ;
! manner, and drove S.F.U. crazy dur-
; ing the 1933 tilt with end around#
