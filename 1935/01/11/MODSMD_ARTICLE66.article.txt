# FROSH BASKETMEN FACE LOWELL HIGH HOOPMEN TONIGHT
## 
### 
Prospects for an undefeated frosh
basketball team this season faded
slightly last night when the stwo i
standouts of Coach Jimmie Brad
shaw's babe quintet, Hank Luisetti ,
and Bob Zonne, went on the sick j
list.
Tonight in the Pavilion at 6:30
o'clock the hoopmen face Lowell
High School, the best prep school
team in San Francisco, and tomor- \
row evening they go into action !
against Marin J.C., rated by many as
the strongest junior college squad i
in Northern California.
AnkJe Injured
In a practice session late yesterday |
afternoon, Luisetti stumbled over a
fellow player, re-injuring the ankle
which he turned while playing
against Palo Alto High last Friday
night. It is probable that the stellar
forward will start tonight but
whether he will be able to remain
in the game any length of time is
questionable.
Zonne was shaping up nicely for
tonight's encounter when he was
overcome with the flu. He was sent
to the hospital by the team phy
sician, and will probably not return
to practice until next week.
Lineup Named
If Luisetti's condition permits his
starting tonight he will take the
floor in the center post, replacing
Zonne. Should LuisetU be unable
to play, Byron Fordahase will be at
center. Following is the probable
starting lineup: center, Hank Lui
setti; forwards, Clarence Mauer and
Bill Hulbert; guards, H. B. Lee and
Nelly Heath.
Lowell High School will bring a
shining light in local high school
basketball circles to the Pavilion to
night in the person of Carl Tropp
man. Last year Troppman was
# elected all-city forward, as was
Stanford's present frosh player, Lui
i setti.
Marin J.C. has an enviable record
thus far in the season. They scored
a ten-point win over the Athens
; Club in Oakland which lost to the
University of California varsity by
only three points. Three players of
the Marin championship team of last
' year will be seen in action Saturday
night.
