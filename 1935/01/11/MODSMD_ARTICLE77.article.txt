# Mascot Interrupts Poly Sci Lecture; Will Be Suspended
## 
### 
Political "barkings" and- the
ordinary canine variety have
very different musical qualities
to the ears of Professor Thomas
Barclay of the political science
department. Barclay takes a
keen interest in political dog
fights but apparently finds no
enjoyment in canine paw
wows, or bow-wows, at least
when it comes to the point of
having his lecture interrupted.
Now assembly orators can
cause suspension of classes
without penalty, but when a
canine tries to express his
views on American national
government, that's going a bit
too far, according to University
authorities. So Raleigh, the
S.A.E. mascot, was given a sus
pended sentence last night pro
vided he leave the campus
within the ensuing 48 hours.
Questioned on the suspension
of the "poly sci" auditor. Comp
troller Almon E. Roth said:
"The dog has been attending
too many classes; and he has
n't even paid his fees.' r
