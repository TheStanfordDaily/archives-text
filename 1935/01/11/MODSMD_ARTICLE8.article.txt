# GERMANY BID TO LEAGUE PARLEY
## January Meeting Faced By Five Major Issues 
### 
GENEVA. Jan. 10 (/P). — New
moves to get Germany back into the
League of Nations stirred enthus
iasm in Geneva tonight on the eve
of the league council's January meet
ing, which will consider the result
of the Saar plebiscite.
Great Britain's bid to the Reich to
send representatives to the council
sessions during discussion of the
plebiscite, although declined by the
Berlin government, was taken here
to be the first step toward getting
Germany to return to active league
membership.
The British initiative also was con
sidered as probably an outgrowth of
the new Franco-Italian accords.
As Europe's statesmen began ar
riving at the league seat for tomor
row's initial session of the council,
officials emphasized that Germany
remains a full-fledged member of
the league until her l'esignation be
comes effective in October and hence
the Reich's delegate could attend the
council session without an invita
tion.
The council session, opening one
day after the league's fifteenth birth
day, faced five major issues, of which
the Saar plebiscite, involving as it
does the disposition of the future na
tional allegiance of that rich terri
tory, held most immediate interest.
They are:
1. The dispute between Iraq, one
of the newer nations, and Persia over
alleged border violations by the lat
ter.
2. The border conflict between
Italy and ancient Ethiopio which,
while not officially on the agenda,
probably will come up for discus
sion. Ethiopia has charged Italian
aggression, to which Italy has re
plied with assertions that Ethiopians
were the aggressors.
