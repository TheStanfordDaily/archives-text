# Munro Rails Government Collectivism
## Noted Author Criticizes Planned Economy 
### 
When textbooks came to life yes
terday morning for students at the
all-University Assembly, they at
tacked the New Deal and "planned
economy." Dr. William B. Munro,
author of many standard works on
political science, and a t professor of
government at Cal Tech, was speak
ing on "Youth and the New Politics."
Today's depressions are more se
vere, he intimated, because America
is a bigger country, and the periods
preceding the depressions are longer.
But there is nothing new in depres
sions or in the "political revolutions"
that follow them.
Predicts Slow Recovery
Only the way we handle them Is
different. In previous times, the
country followed the theory of "Let
nature take its course," that patience
was a virtue, that liquidation could
not be attained in one easy jump,
and that local governments, which
were nearer to the people, should
handle relief.
Said Dr. Munro: "We were a long
time getting into this depression and
we'll be a long time getting out. We
will only find prosperity after look
ing around many corners."
Planning Scored
Of economic planning he was par
ticularly scornful. "If we expand
governmental functions to control
credit, banking, and social problems,
the day of democratic government as
we understand it is past."
These added functions, he de
clared. cannot be well carried out
by a democratic government, which
is slow moving. "The more demo
cratic a government is in fact, the
least efficient in practice. There is
nothing that a government should do
if some other agency can do it
better."
"We'll come as we always do, not
by taking some spectacular flight
into collectivism, not by some short
run of trial and error, but by taking
the path at a walk and by exercising
a due amount of patience.

Of "The New Politics" Cal Tech's
textbook writer had said a great
deal. Of "Youth and the New Poli
tics" nothing. Credit for only ref
erence to youth goes to President Ray
Lyman Wilbur, who wryly suggested
that since college editors filled their
columns with much criticism of gov
ernment, it might be advisable for
them to learn about government.
The fairly large (for an assem
bly) audience liberally applauded
the speaker. And the many Cit stu
dents, who had laboriously taken
notes, folded up their binders in sat
isfaction and departed.

Today's depressions are more se
vere, he intimated, because America
is a bigger country, and the periods
preceding the depressions are longer.
But there is nothing new in depres
sions or in the "political revolutions"
that follow them.
Predicts Slow Recovery
Only the way we handle them Is
different. In previous times, the
country followed the theory of "Let
nature take its course," that patience
was a virtue, that liquidation could
not be attained in one easy jump,
and that local governments, which
were nearer to the people, should
handle relief.
Said Dr. Munro: "We were a long
time getting into this depression and
we'll be a long time getting out. We
will only find prosperity after look
ing around many corners."
Planning Scored
Of economic planning he was par
ticularly scornful. "If we expand
governmental functions to control
credit, banking, and social problems,
the day of democratic government as
we understand it is past."
These added functions, he de
clared. cannot be well carried out
by a democratic government, which
is slow moving. "The more demo
cratic a government is in fact, the
least efficient in practice. There is
nothing that a government should do
if some other agency can do it
better."
"We'll come as we always do, not
by taking some spectacular flight
into collectivism, not by some short
run of trial and error, but by taking
the path at a walk and by exercising
a due amount of patience.

Lyman Wilbur, who wryly suggested
that since college editors filled their
columns with much criticism of gov
ernment, it might be advisable for
them to learn about government.
The fairly large (for an assem

notes, folded up their binders in sat
