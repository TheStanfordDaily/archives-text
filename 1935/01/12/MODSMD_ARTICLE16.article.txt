# More Pledges Last Year; Average 15
## 
### 
Last year's women's pledging,
which took place at exactly the
same time of the quarter, saw the
nine houses pledge 138 women, an
average of 15 per house.
Noi only was the total number
of pledges greater, but the vari
ation in number, not regulated as
tl;is year by Pan Hellenic, was
also large. The smallest number
of pledges was eight, recorded by
two houses; while one sorority
pledged 24 to hold the record.
The- 1934 total will in all proba
bility go down as the largest num
ber of women ever pledged by the
Stanford sororities, since the new
plan of curtailing pledging accord
ing to capacity will probably hold
each year's numbers down to ap
proximately the number taken in
this year.
