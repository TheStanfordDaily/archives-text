# Trojans Win From Cardinal Hoopsters
## 
### 
Out to avenge a 40-30 defeat
handed them last night by Sam
Barry's Trojans,, the Stanford
basketball team was to meet the
Southern invaders again tonight
in tlie Pavilion.
After holding the Trojans to a
small lead in the first half, Stanford
had trouble guarding men and liit
ting the basket later in the game,
and the southerners, led by Lee
Guttero, broke into a large lead.
Southern California used a slow
break in the first half with which
the Indians were very much able
to compete, but a change of pace
during the second half brought the
scoring up. Guttero, who had been
well guarded by Ken Nobs during
the first half, was left free several
times later in the game and sneaked
in several times to bring himself
high point honors before he left
the game on fouls. Ofiicialing was
di igent.
In the preliminary game the
Stanford freshmen defeated Low
ell High School, strong San Fran
cisco team, 34 to 19.
