# Co-eds Heave Sighs of Relief as Big Drive Ends
## 
### 
Well, it's over. After a week of
long, strained silences, forced con
versations on the weather, and the
immortality of the soul, the lambs
will lie down with the lions tonight,
and enjoy their first night of "sor
ority life."
Mattresses, bedclothes, pillows,
and beds are a scarcity in sorority
circles tonight, and upperclasswo
men whose legal address is within
a respectable distance of the cam
pus, are playing host to other up
perclasswoinen, so tliat there will
be enough room for the class of
'38.
Tomorrow morning, the alarm
clocks that usually start civil wars
on the sleeping porches, will not
shrilly pierce the Sabbath air.
Arising at a fashionable hour, most

of the sororities will come down to
breakfast about 10:30 to the sound
of rattling kettles in the kitchen.
The bleary-eyed hashers, already
tired from leering at the new pled
ges through the kitchen door and
considerably beaten down ofter
their labors of the preceding week,
will slap the waffles and little pitf
sausages down on the table with a
considerably firmer slap than pre
viously, when they jousted with
filet miguon and turkey over the
long, bare-backed evening gowns.
If the women come down to
breakfast in pajamas and dressing
gowns, as some sorority women
are wont to do, there will be con
siderable improvement in the hash
ing, however.
