# Rushing Season Ends With Formal Choice by Freshmen
## 
### 
Ninety-five cheeks were kissed tonight, ninety-five pledges hugged
and squeezed, as Stanford's nine sororities welcome the neophytes of
1935 sisterhood of the Row.

In numbers, this year's class
taken by the sororities could not
hold a candle to last year's, but
most sororities were exuberant
over what they consider one of
the best classes in point of
"quality" they ever had.
PLEDGES LIMITED
Just at the time when there were
.more women than ever clamoring
for admittance to the Greek so
cieties, Pan Hellenic, the Lasuen
Street Parliament, had limited the
number of women who could take
the pin to very small proportions.
Pan Hellenic's action was made
necessary by the large total last
year, when sororities were swept
away by the possibilities of the
large class of women and filled
their houses so full that a propor
tionately larger number of women
this year will never know the pleas
this year wi.l never know the
dubious pleasures of pledge duty
and Sunday right suppers.
Row leaders can see in these
tendencies two trends: 1. The large
number of women who will "go
hall" may found a strong com
petitive spirit that may be able to
compete with the Row for general
leadership in activities, and pos
sibly ru.sliing. 2. The general up
building of the minor sororities to
a position where they may better
compete with the "Big Three,"
who have become steeped in tra
dition—and legacies.
•Mter about 9:30 tonight, the
various sororities will throw open
Jiiir doors and invite the masculin
ity of the Farm in to survey and
dance with their new "finds." Or
chestras of a sort are in prospect
in most ot the houses, as are light
refreshments.
OPEN HOUSE
After the men are shooed away
•lightly later, the serious business
of formal pledging of the neo
phytes will begin, and continue
until every la.st one of the fiedg
lings has suddenly become a real,
honest-to-goodness pledge.
The new pledges will spend the
night in the houses they have
chosen for the next three years of
their college careers, with break
fast tomorrow the first official meal
at which the sisters and pledges
meet.
Open houses were planned earlcir
this year than in former years, due
to the new system of selection
put into effect this time by Pan
Hellenic. Sororities turned in for
mal lists last night, a preferred
list and an alternative one. Fresh
men designated first, second, and
third choices of houses on a card,
Then the two lists were compared
and a final list prepared which in
dicated which house each fresh
man was to pledge.

year, when sororities were swept
away by the possibilities of the
large class of women and filled
their houses so full that a propor
tionately larger number of women
this year will never know the pleas
this year wi.l never know the
dubious pleasures of pledge duty
and Sunday right suppers.
Row leaders can see in these
tendencies two trends: 1. The large
number of women who will "go
hall" may found a strong com
petitive spirit that may be able to
compete with the Row for general
leadership in activities, and pos
sibly ru.sliing. 2. The general up
building of the minor sororities to
a position where they may better
compete with the "Big Three,"
who have become steeped in tra
dition—and legacies.
•Mter about 9:30 tonight, the
various sororities will throw open
Jiiir doors and invite the masculin
ity of the Farm in to survey and
dance with their new "finds." Or
chestras of a sort are in prospect
in most ot the houses, as are light
refreshments.
OPEN HOUSE
After the men are shooed away
•lightly later, the serious business
of formal pledging of the neo
phytes will begin, and continue
until every la.st one of the fiedg
lings has suddenly become a real,
honest-to-goodness pledge.
The new pledges will spend the
night in the houses they have
chosen for the next three years of
their college careers, with break
fast tomorrow the first official meal
at which the sisters and pledges
meet.
Open houses were planned earlcir
this year than in former years, due
to the new system of selection
put into effect this time by Pan
Hellenic. Sororities turned in for
mal lists last night, a preferred
list and an alternative one. Fresh
men designated first, second, and
third choices of houses on a card,
Then the two lists were compared
and a final list prepared which in
dicated which house each fresh
man was to pledge.

Ninety-five cheeks were kissed tonight, ninety-five pledges hugged
and squeezed, as Stanford's nine sororities welcome the neophytes of
1935 sisterhood of the Row.

In numbers, this year's class
taken by the sororities could not
hold a candle to last year's, but
most sororities were exuberant
over what they consider one of
the best classes in point of
"quality" they ever had.
PLEDGES LIMITED
Just at the time when there were
.more women than ever clamoring
for admittance to the Greek so
cieties, Pan Hellenic, the Lasuen
Street Parliament, had limited the
number of women who could take
the pin to very small proportions.
Pan Hellenic's action was made
necessary by the large total last
year, when sororities were swept
away by the possibilities of the
large class of women and filled
their houses so full that a propor
tionately larger number of women
