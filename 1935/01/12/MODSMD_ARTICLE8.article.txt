### 
Pan-Hellenic officials late this
afternoon expressed the feeling
that the 1934-35 rushing season
was the most successful they
had known both from the Row
and hall standpoint.
Margaret Taylor, president of
of Pan-Hell, stated: "Thanks to
the cooperation of everyone on
the campus the new system
seems to have worked better
than the old one, both from the
freshmen and sorority angle.
The difficulties that arose from
a misunderstanding of the num
ber that each house had agreed
upon were settled by a re-dis
cussion of the basis for the
agreement, i. e. the desire to
keep houses down to a reason
able size so that all the benefits
could be gained by each member.
"There stiil is much room for
improvement in the system and
we hope to work out many of
the problems during the remain
der of this year."
Charlotte Gibner, vice-presi
dent: "As far as the houses are
concerned the system worked
out very well but from the fresh
man standpoint it was difficult,
although the invitation by card
throughout instead of verbally
was much easier for both."
