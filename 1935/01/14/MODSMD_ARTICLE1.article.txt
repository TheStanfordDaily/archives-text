SAARBRUECKEN, Saar Basin
Territory, Jan. 13 (A*). —In grim but
orderly silence more than half a '
million Germans stepped today into 1
and arena closely watched by all the j
world and with plebiscite ballots
battled for clashing ideals of liberty,
religion, and patriotism.
In contrast with the blaring cam
paign conducted by Nazis and oth- |
ers, there was no martial music or :
loud rallying to the attack.
Votes Cast Swiftly
Ballots were cast with no outward
indication of their allegiance, but so j
swiftly that two hours before the
plebiscite polls closed a survey
showed a 100 per cent vote had been
achieved in many districts, with j
Saarbruecken precincts averaging 98 :
per cent. The number of qualified
voters was 543,323.
Election officials predicted at least i
99 per cent participation in most [
Saarbruecken districts, with the vote j
likely to be completed before 8 [
o'clock closing time. Results will not j
be known until Tuesday.
A communist demonstration early
in the morning caused a brief dis- '
turbance and there were a few ar
rests, but not at any polling place.
According to reports available in
midafternoon, there was not a dis
turbance of any kind at the polls
anywhere in the territory.
