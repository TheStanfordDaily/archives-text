# DROP SHOWN IN NUMBER TAKING SORORITY BIDS
## Nine Greek Houses Pledge 95 Women Against 138 Last Year 
### 
Averaging ten and one-half pledges
apiece the nine Stanford sororities
closed their rushing season by form
al bidding Saturday night. Although
a larger number of new women were
admitted this year, the number of
women who pledged is considerably
smaller. One hundred and thirty
eight women went Greek last year,
as compared with 95 this year.
This decrease, nearly one-third,
is due to the limitation put on the
number of pledges each house was
advised to take. This quota was
reached after consultation between
the house presidents and the Ad
ministration. House capacity was
the determining factor in deciding
the recommended quota. Pledge
classes varied in number from two
to 19.
New System Used
Over half of the freshmen wom.'n
went hall, as well as a large majority
of transfers. These women will be
accommodated next year in the new
dormitox'y, Lagunita, and in the va
rious divisions of the Union unit.
Under the new rushing system,
all rushing invitations were given
formally on printed cards instead of
by word of mouth as before. This
method help to lessen the customary
confusion between house and rushee.
The administration has requested
that each house keep these cards,
so that a survey may be made arid
further improvement might be made
in the rushing system next year.
Open Houses Held
The new preferential bidding sys
tem expedited the preliminary hall
pledging, so that the sororities were
able to open their doors to the cu
rious men about 9:30 o'clock. Houses
were again closed about 10:30 o'clock
when formal pledging began. After
various midnight feasts, cookey
shines, and bull sessions, the pledges
spent the night with their new sis
ters.
Festivities continued yesterday,
with brunches, luncheons, and Sun
day night suppers.
