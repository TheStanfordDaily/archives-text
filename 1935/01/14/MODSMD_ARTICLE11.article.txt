### 
Stanford's speaker on the Univer
sity radio program at 8 o'clock to
night will be Harry W. Maloney.
director of minor sports, who will
address a KGO audience on "The
Importance of Keeping Physically
Fit as Well as Mentally Alert."
The popular athletic director will
relate his experiences with men
whose relaxation from athletic en
deavor after graduation from college
leaves them in sluggish physical
condition; he will offer a cure for
this condition as well as present a
series of exercises to be taken by
people in middle age to adjust or
maintain the desirable physical con
dition while busy in a business world
demanding mental alertnessâ€”a de
mand which cannot long be met, Ma
loney says, unless the physique is
kept in proper trim.
The Stanford' trainer and coach
will offer the middle-aged person a
cure who finds 18 holes of golf once
a week too much exercise at one
time. Maloney is a strong advocate
of moderation in exercise as well as
in menu.
