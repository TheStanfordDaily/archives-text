# Lagunita Opening Slated For Saturday Morning
## 
### BARBARA SWEET 
Although authorities announced |
yesterday that Lake Lagunita will be
officially opened next Saturday
morning, three unknown but hardy
campus maidens found it impossible
to wait so long a time for a dip in
the muddy waters. Icy January
winds, threatening skies, and a hos
pital full of influenza patients held
no terrors for the potential Gertrude
Ederles, who donned their bathing
suits early last week-end and gained
the distinction of being the first in
the lake this season.
The boathouse will receive ca
noes after 10 o'clock Thursday morn
ing, although no canoeing will be
permitted until Saturday. Students
are requested to telephone Palo Alto
22495 before bringing their canoes to
the lake.
Much the same set of rules will
prevail at Lagunita as were in force
last year. No swimming test is re
quired of students, but a knowledge
of swimming is desirable. Canoes

| must be equipped with regulation
doughnut life-preservers, and not
more than three occupants are per- !
mitted to a canoe.
In case of upset, students are
warned to stay with their canoes, i
The canoes are strong enough to i
hold up several persons, and under J
no conditions should the occupants ;
try to swim to shore. Cling to the
boat until the life guard arrives.
Persons overturning canoes must!
register with the attendant, accord- j
ing to a new rule. They will lose-!
their right to the lake for the rest of
the day. This rule applies especially
to freshmen.
The lake will be open from 10
o'clock in* the morning to 10 o'clock |
at night. Use of the lake is free, with
the exception of storage space for j
canoes. In addition, canoes may be )
rented at the boathouse by those who
do not own one. The lake is pri
marily for the use of Stanford stu- |
dents and their friends.
