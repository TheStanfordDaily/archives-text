# Card Quintet Stages Comeback; Defeats U.S.C. In Close Tilt
## Indians Wrest 38-36 Win From Trojan Invaders In Second Tussle LOSE OPENING GAME Week Ends with Conference In Four-Way Tie Over Week-end 
### 
"Boy, it's going to be a close race
this year!" shouted Coach Sam Barry
ol the Trojans to Coach John Bunn
of the Indians in the melee follow
ing Stanford's surprise come-back
Saturday night to defeat U.S.C. .Jb
-30 after dropping the opener the
night before 40-30.
Barry was right. Not only did th r i
Cards and the Trojans split but the
Bears and the Bruins divided in lh<i
south, leaving the Coast Conference
race in a four-way tie at the close
of the first week.
Friday night the Indians stayed
within one point of the Trojans until
Keith Topping was sent in for Ken
Nobs several minutes before the first
half was over. Topping's previous
play with the first-string had been
limited to a few minutes in practice
and he did not have the feel of the
Indian defense. As a result Lee Gut
tero, Jack Hupp, and Ernie Idol
brook of the Trojans slipped behind
the Card defense for short shots, and
U.S.C. scored four field goals while
Stanford was tallying two and a free
throw.
The Indians were never able to
make up the three-point lead which
the Trojans took at half-time, and
the second half found Barry's team
forging rapidly ahead, until the
Cards closed fast with Rod Bost and
Robin Lindsay scoring.
Saturday night the Indians started
ofT wilh even more determination
and willingness than had marked
their play the night before. Due to
the work of Guttero and Holbrook
U.S.C. took an early 3-1 lead, but
the Indians put on the pressure and,
thought tied at 6-6, 8-8, 12-12, and
19-19, were never headed during
that half. Howell Turner and 80-.t
matched the Trojan offense by scor
ing spectacularly, while Dinty Moore
dribbled through the entire Trojan
team to hook in the final field goal
that gave the Cards a-21-19 lead at
half time.
Again the Trojans came back
strong in the second half as Hupp
swished two and Holbrook dropped
in a short one to give S.C. a 25-23
lead. Then the Stanford sophs, Tin
ner and Moore, brought the Indians
to the fore again with daring, diffi
cult shots from the floor. U.S.C. tied
it up once more, but Moore, Nobs,
and Turner gave the Cards a lead
which even the high-scoring Hupp
and Guttero couldn't overcome, and
Stanford had a one-goal lead at the
final gun.
With Stanford forcing the attack
throughout the game and matching
U.S.C.'s powerful offense with one
handed "let-'er-fly" shots, and with
the mighty Trojans pressing in the
final minutes when their reputation
as title favorites was at stake, the
Saturday game was a wild one. Oik:
of the more hectic moments was
! when Stanford had six men on the
floor, Referee Lefty Sproul being un
-1 able to hear the time-keeper's whis
tle because of the bedlam.
A minute or so before the final gun
when the referee called a doubtful
foul on Hupp of the Trojans, Coach
Barry needed quiet and fresh air so
i badly that he left the S.C. bench and
I stalked out of the Pavilion to get
' some.
Stanford's next conference game
will be with California in Berkeley
next Friday.
