# Budget for Need — Not Waste
## 
### 
From the apostles of disaster who see po
tential catastrophe in every act of govern
ment that does not conform to traditional
business practices, there lias arisen a great
outcry over the failure of the Administration
to balance the budget for the coming fiscal
year.
Now everyone admits that a balanced
budget is a very fine thing to have. That is
the theory of the matter, but, as someone once
remarked, we are faced with a condition, not
a theory. There are millions upon millions
of unemployed in the country whose Inst hope
for survival is the government of the t'nifed
States.
II government conformed to traditional
business practice these unfortunates would be
turned loose to shift for themselves regard
less of the consequences. That is what pri
vate industry does when it wishes to balance
its budget, (iovermnenl, however, recognizes
certain obligations that have no place in the
philosophy of capitalistic enterprise. In the
ory, one may decry the policy of governmental
paternalism but, in point of fact, people must
eat regardless of the means employed.
Obviously, feeding the hungry, by giving
jobs or by giving doles, costs money. Today,
then, an unbalanced budget is inevitable, as
far as the demand for relief is concerned,
the justification lor this fiscal policy lies in
the fervent hope and belief that private indus
try will soon be able to assume its share of
the burden, giving the government an oppor
tunity to recoup its losses by increased tax
revenues and reduced expenses. If business
has any dfmbts about its own recuperative
powers, then truly there is no hope. But the
New Dealers evidently have more faith in the
capitalistic system than the capitalists them
selves.
Any irrational fear that government credit
is unsound should be dispelled by the fact
thai a recent $900,000,000 Treasury bond
issue was subscribed five times over in the
lirsl day that it was offered.
Much of the criticism directed against gov
ernmental practices in the disbursement of
these tremendous sums of money lies in the
charges of "waste" where the intent has been
one of relief. In the gigantic orgy of spending,
intended to restore in some measure that in
tangible idea known as "prosperity," there
undoubtedly have been unnecessary expendi
tures resulting from political rather than
economic action.
Hut the need for actual relief and the neces
sity for eliminating waste should not serve
to confuse lh« question of the budget.
So, government assumes the burden of
caring for the casualties of industrial warfare
while industry itself sits back and twiddles
its thumbs and refuses to do anything as long
as government continues to "meddle." Yet
industry will want these same unemployed
which government "meddling" provides for,
to be alive and well once it has use for them
again.
