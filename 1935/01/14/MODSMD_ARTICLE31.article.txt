# The 						Gals Are Happyâ€” Let's Keep Them So
## 
### 
Sororities, dormitories, ami freshmen
breathe of the fresh, damp air this morning
and I eel pretty good for all of the nasty things
thai have been said during the past four
monl lis.
No major casualties are reported as yet,
although threats of exposure of illegal meet
ings and discussions are still prevalent. There
the situation stands, with house mothers,
rushing chairman, and freshmen a good ileal
happier than in other years because of the
fact that so many "nice" women are to tie
Itnind almost anywhere on the campus.
The Winds of Freedom are blowing with
a powerful blast, and both dormitories and
sororities should profit thereby with a health
ier attitude on the campus in this regard.
Pan-Hellenic chiefs earned the pretty orchid
this year, not for perfection of accomplish
ment or for successful achievement, but
rather for wading through the scalping sea
son with fewer mishaps and less trouble than
in the past.

There is work to be done. While the mem
ory of the past few weeks is still clear and
strong, immediate consideration should be

given every possible weakness in this year's
system.
Among oilier items, the Duly suggests the
elimination of hypocrisy from the so-called
"Conference Party" that is traditionally the
first gun in women's rushing.
II there is going to he such a party in the
future, and the women seem to enjoy them,
why not make it an official Fan-Hellenic al
fair, and admit the purpose of "meeting" new
women?
