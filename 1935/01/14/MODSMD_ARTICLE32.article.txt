Because the student manager and some
members of the Executive Committee have
spasmodically contracted acute headaches
over the monumental sum of 7."> cents per
subscriber which is being diverted to the
Stanford Daily operating fund, they are re
putedly on the verge of easing their collective
mind and conscience by reducing the stipend
lf> cents.
In opposition to Ibis pinch-penny attitude,
is the sentiment of the campus expressed in
approval of tlie Daily's rushing extra. That
the late Saturday night edition served a vital
and appreciated purpose is the consensus of
the many phone calls and notes received at
the Daily shack yesterday.
Of the •s!"> which the student planks down
on registration day in addition to his tuition,
the Daily is the only tangible return which
everyone receives. The Health Service, the
Associated Students, the 8.A.C., the theatre
fund, the I'nion all grab their cut, and then
if the individual becomes ill, goes to a dance,
a plav, or a basketball game he is obliged to
vivjd up more of the "ready" cash.
The Daily always, whether it is subsidized
a dime or a dollar by the student, will continue
to give the utmost service within its power. At
present it is attempting to give full representa
tion to campus characters and events through
its local picture features. These, just as the
rushing extra, cost money. The Daily is able
to furnish them because of the students' 75
cents subscription. It hopes to better these
features and in the near future add other
improvements, which obviously must be fore
gone if its operating fund is curtailed.
The Daily trusts that it will continue to
earn the approval of a campus which is re
ceiving in this newspaper a tangible return
on its dollars, instead of a mere sense of
wonder at "where in the hell the money all
g< >es."
