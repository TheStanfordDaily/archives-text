Benito Mussolini intends to make the world in
creasingly Italy-conscious in 1935. His methods of
winning friends for Italy abroad display a finesse and
acumen that compels admiration.
Lute, II Duce's otiicial film propaganda division,
is aiding Italy's cinema industry in a drive for
larger foreign markets in 1935. Twelve super talk
ing pictures in English are in course of preparation
at Tirrenia, Italy's new Hollywood. Mussolini
has even collaborated with an author on a film
version of "The One Hundred Days," a Napoleonic
play. This year is also the Bellini-centenary year,
and elaborate preparations are under way to honor
the celebrated opera-composer.
Mussolini's cultural appeal to the world at large
has now been brought as it were to our very doors in
his government's exhibit of 90 representative contem
porary Italian masters of painting at the California
Palace of the Legion of Honor in Lincoln Park, San
Francisco. The gala premiere Friday night showing was
an event drawing prominent civic leaders, business
men, educators, and foreign consuls from all over the
bay region.
His Excellency, Galeazzo Ciano, under-secretary of
state for press and propaganda, Rome, heads II Duce's
general honorary committee which arranged through
co-operation of Dr. Walter Heil, curator of the Palace
of the Legion of Honor, for the San Francisco exhibit.
The Ameritan ambassador to-Rome, the Italian ambas
sador at Washington, Guglielmo Marconi, the scientist,
and seven other distinguished persons constitute tho
remainder of the committee. Regional honorary com
mitteemen include such well-known individuals as
Herbert Fleishhacker, A. P. Gianini, Archbishop E. J.
Hanna, Mayor Angelo J. Rossi, and Leland Cutler, to
mention a few of the twenty-five.
The fundamental purpose of the exhibit is to prove
that artistic and cultural life waxes apace under the
banner of the new Italy—that fascism has not caused
art to languish, but rather that the new Italy has pro
duced a new art.
Dr. Kurt F. Reinhardt gives a critique of the Italian
government's exhibit after visiting it Friday evening:
"The initial impression one derives from this
exhibit of 90 modern Italian paintings is that the
modern Italian school does not depend upon tradi
tional French modernism for inspiration. While a
fairly large number of pictures present familiar
subject matter, there are several artists who pre- .
sent works from a new angle of social significance.
There are some who follow the cul-de-sac of
abstractionism and 'Gertrude Stein-ism' and feel
that the less comprehensible their works are. the
greater their artistic value.
"Giorgio De Chirico, one of the best known modern
ists, has some quite interesting paintings of abstrac
tionist and symbolistic theme. His picture, "The Ar
cheologists" strikes one as a work of biting satire.
"Mario Sironi has four striking pictures in which
he emphasizes the fascist ideal of the dignity of labor.
The execution, however, is often unbalanced, and the
colors appear smeared.
"Mario Tozzi gives an original allegorical illustra
tion of the underlying theme of the win
ning play of Pirandello: 'Six Characters in Search of
an Author.' Tozzi's picture, "The New Generation
Gives Life to the Plastic Arts," symbolizes the essen
tial brotherhood of workers, and places the artist and
artisan on the same plane.
"Fausto Pirandello has a large canvas entitled
'Stairway,' which is a bizarre type of belated impres
sionism, and contains a great deal of the voluptuous
appeal of Renoir. •
"Franco Gentilini's tempera of 'Youth' is the por
trait of a staunch young fascist, painted in a fresh
vitality of form.
"In my opinion one of the best paintings is 'Midday,'
by Gisberto Ceracchini, a large figural composition of
recherche pattern, presenting the back-to-the-soil
idrology so emphasized by Mussolini.
"In general, although I do not feel there are any
artists shown here who compare with Thomas
Benton. Diego Rivera, Jose Clem en te Oro/.co, or
Barlach, the exhibit is undoubtedly one of merit,
representative of the artistic efforts and trends of
contemporary Italy."

Benito Mussolini intends to make the world in
creasingly Italy-conscious in 1935. His methods of
winning friends for Italy abroad display a finesse and
acumen that compels admiration.
Lute, II Duce's otiicial film propaganda division,
is aiding Italy's cinema industry in a drive for
larger foreign markets in 1935. Twelve super talk
ing pictures in English are in course of preparation
at Tirrenia, Italy's new Hollywood. Mussolini
has even collaborated with an author on a film
version of "The One Hundred Days," a Napoleonic
play. This year is also the Bellini-centenary year,
and elaborate preparations are under way to honor
the celebrated opera-composer.
Mussolini's cultural appeal to the world at large
has now been brought as it were to our very doors in
his government's exhibit of 90 representative contem
porary Italian masters of painting at the California
Palace of the Legion of Honor in Lincoln Park, San
Francisco. The gala premiere Friday night showing was
an event drawing prominent civic leaders, business
men, educators, and foreign consuls from all over the
bay region.
His Excellency, Galeazzo Ciano, under-secretary of
state for press and propaganda, Rome, heads II Duce's
general honorary committee which arranged through
co-operation of Dr. Walter Heil, curator of the Palace
of the Legion of Honor, for the San Francisco exhibit.
The Ameritan ambassador to-Rome, the Italian ambas
sador at Washington, Guglielmo Marconi, the scientist,
and seven other distinguished persons constitute tho
remainder of the committee. Regional honorary com
mitteemen include such well-known individuals as
Herbert Fleishhacker, A. P. Gianini, Archbishop E. J.
Hanna, Mayor Angelo J. Rossi, and Leland Cutler, to
mention a few of the twenty-five.
The fundamental purpose of the exhibit is to prove
that artistic and cultural life waxes apace under the
banner of the new Italy—that fascism has not caused
art to languish, but rather that the new Italy has pro
duced a new art.
Dr. Kurt F. Reinhardt gives a critique of the Italian
government's exhibit after visiting it Friday evening:
"The initial impression one derives from this
exhibit of 90 modern Italian paintings is that the
modern Italian school does not depend upon tradi
tional French modernism for inspiration. While a
fairly large number of pictures present familiar
subject matter, there are several artists who pre- .
sent works from a new angle of social significance.
There are some who follow the cul-de-sac of
abstractionism and 'Gertrude Stein-ism' and feel
that the less comprehensible their works are. the
greater their artistic value.
"Giorgio De Chirico, one of the best known modern
ists, has some quite interesting paintings of abstrac
tionist and symbolistic theme. His picture, "The Ar
cheologists" strikes one as a work of biting satire.
"Mario Sironi has four striking pictures in which
he emphasizes the fascist ideal of the dignity of labor.
The execution, however, is often unbalanced, and the
colors appear smeared.
"Mario Tozzi gives an original allegorical illustra
tion of the underlying theme of the win
ning play of Pirandello: 'Six Characters in Search of
an Author.' Tozzi's picture, "The New Generation
Gives Life to the Plastic Arts," symbolizes the essen
tial brotherhood of workers, and places the artist and
artisan on the same plane.
