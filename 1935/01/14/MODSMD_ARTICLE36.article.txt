"THE WINTER WONDERLAND"
YOSEMITE PARK. Jan. 12. —
Everyone had been to Yosemite ex
cept me. That, of course, did not
prevent me from telling pop-eyed
outlanders of the glories that exist
here—for I had studied my geology
and chamber of commerce. Yet al
though I have always had a secret
dread that the park was probably j
commercialized until the Yoseimte
Falls were ready to flow back uphill
for shame, I still wanted to see £01
myself.
No one should go to Heaven who
has nor seen Yosemite at 8 o'clock
at night, with a sliver of new rnoou
at the valley's rim casting a soft,
cold light on the tons of snow below. '
To remain a devtrtee of the scientific
method, one must have some basis
for objective comparison — even
when entering the Pearly Gates.
Geology texts describe Yosemite as ,
a giant "'U" carved from the moun
tains hy glaeiation. But geology texts |
are notoriously unaesthetic. For if ,
every letter of the alphabet were as >
inspiring as this "U," no one would
object to the study of languages.
The towering rock walls of Yose
mite, capped with snow ancl studded
with trees, are overwhelming to say
the least. Compared with this rug
ged massiveness, Grand Canyon is
like a papier mache movie set. It
stands so ominous that one is almost
compelled to "believe."
As yet, there are only two things
the matter with Yosemite. For one
thing, everything is catalogued and
named. You turn to gape here—and
it is Half Dome. In a reverie, you ,
gasp at that —and someone informs
you it Is El Capitan. You are not
permitted to gasp in peace. You
cannot feel even for a moment that
you are discoveiing Nature for your
self. Someone has been here before
you—and you must commune with
Nature at second hand, through a
medium.
Also—the California sales tax still
remains. We had hoped that in com
ing here, we were moving out of
California into the United States.
But though the federal government
holds nominal title to the park, .the

California C. of C.is rapidly an
nexing it in fact.
Someday maybe America will be
all California. Then a few of us
will fortify "Half Dome" and go into
hibernation.

No one should go to Heaven who
has nor seen Yosemite at 8 o'clock
at night, with a sliver of new rnoou
at the valley's rim casting a soft,
cold light on the tons of snow below. '
To remain a devtrtee of the scientific
method, one must have some basis
for objective comparison — even
when entering the Pearly Gates.
Geology texts describe Yosemite as ,
a giant "'U" carved from the moun

are notoriously unaesthetic. For if ,
every letter of the alphabet were as >
inspiring as this "U," no one would
object to the study of languages.
The towering rock walls of Yose
mite, capped with snow ancl studded
with trees, are overwhelming to say
the least. Compared with this rug
ged massiveness, Grand Canyon is
like a papier mache movie set. It
stands so ominous that one is almost
compelled to "believe."
As yet, there are only two things
the matter with Yosemite. For one
thing, everything is catalogued and
named. You turn to gape here—and
it is Half Dome. In a reverie, you ,
gasp at that —and someone informs
you it Is El Capitan. You are not
permitted to gasp in peace. You
cannot feel even for a moment that
you are discoveiing Nature for your
self. Someone has been here before
you—and you must commune with
Nature at second hand, through a
medium.
Also—the California sales tax still
remains. We had hoped that in com
ing here, we were moving out of
California into the United States.
But though the federal government
holds nominal title to the park, .the

California C. of C.is rapidly an
nexing it in fact.
Someday maybe America will be
all California. Then a few of us
will fortify "Half Dome" and go into
hibernation.

"THE WINTER WONDERLAND"
YOSEMITE PARK. Jan. 12. —
Everyone had been to Yosemite ex
cept me. That, of course, did not
prevent me from telling pop-eyed
outlanders of the glories that exist
here—for I had studied my geology
and chamber of commerce. Yet al
though I have always had a secret
dread that the park was probably j
commercialized until the Yoseimte
Falls were ready to flow back uphill
for shame, I still wanted to see £01
myself.
