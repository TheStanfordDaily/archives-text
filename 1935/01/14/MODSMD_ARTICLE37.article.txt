"HAT. COAT, AND GLOVE"
At the Varsity Theatre
A too slow mystery drama, which,
nevertheless, will be of interest to
those seeing something more than
a mere "story" in a picture. For al
though the plot material isn't new,
the treatment of it is. The director

has attempted to
leave the ob
vious to the au
dience's imagi
nation, or has
suggested it by
delicate innuen
do. The camera
becomes not so

much the fourth side of a room, as
a medium portraying emotional re
action and situation. If it hadn't
been so timid in its efforts, and had
n't been shown up by "Crime With
out Passion," which tried the same
thing, this film would have been out
standing.
"The Merry Widow" is also on
bill. Although the combination ol'
Ernst Lubitsch's sophisticated direc
tion, the comedy of Chevalier and
Jeannette McDonald, and the Vic
torian Lehar musical melodrama
doesn't make for a smooth produc
tion, the result is sufficiently pleas
ing to rate "thumbs up." â€”Brill
