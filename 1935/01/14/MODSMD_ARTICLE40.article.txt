The Stanford Indians sprung their
first surprise of the basketball rea
son Saturday night, and they did it
rather convincingly. It was no mere
good fortune that Stanford defeated
the defending Southern California
Trojans, 38 to 36.
So after the first four games, the
southern division of the conference
is right where it started—each of the
four teams have won a game, each
has lost one —but Stanford is defi
nitely ahead, having broken even
with the bunch that is rated '"the
team to beat."
It was all the fault of a couple
of sophomores—tvell, not quite all,
but a good part of it is attributable
\o the work of Dinty Moore and
Howell Turner. Moore was all over
the floor, and it seemed that he
practically caught his own passes.
He retrieved the hall off each bas
ket a surprising percentage of the
time, and was easily the outstand
ing man on the floor.
Turner had his scoring eye on
every conceivable type of shot tu
run up 14 points for a first place tie
in the scoring column.
Stanford basketball teams, in the
past year or so at least, have never
been so fired up. Credit that mainly
to A1 Page, who applied the pins and
needles. Report from the dressing
room said that between the halves
Saturday night the Indians were "too
excited to even leel tired" after a
particularly strenuous first half.
It was worth a lot to watch Sam
Barry walk out of the Pavilion as
the game was drawing to a close.

We never could see much excuse
for that trip California took to Ha
waii to meet a couple of island foot
ball teams. It seemed like a bit far
fetched motive for a trip. The Cali
fomians had a good time, if not as a
football team, at least as guests.
Rugby's revival is definitely es
tablished at Stanford. A better than
average minor sports crowd watched
the season opening Saturday. Very i
few of the spectators, including this j
writer, knew what the score was,
and why. But for that matter very I
few of the players savvied much more
about it.
From what we could see, Johnny j
Reisner, Joe Vigna, and Ray Lewis i
made a smooth-passing and speedy |
combination of backs as they raced
through the Argonauts for a 20 to 0 J
victory. —Browne j
