# Second Campaign On Lasuen Front Looms: 24 Rivals
## 
### 
With women's rushing laid to rest
on the Row, all is not yet quiet on
ihe Lasuen front. Men's rushing, and
its attendant rumors and whisper
ings, is just beginning to exert th-2
final gesture as Stanford's 24 Greek
letter chapters seek to maintain the
"quality and tradition" of each
house.
About this time of year, when the
snail is on the butterhorn, and all is
right with the world, the vague, un
easy rumors of "Who had who" cir
culate up and down the tree-lined
street.
Of course, none of the houses have
any idea as yet as to whom they are
rushing, but there are buttons in
Encina which are not being used for
fastening suspenders.
January 25 is men's pledge night.
After that date all the fun is over.
Rumors will perforce cease. Sole en
tertainment on the Row will then
resolve to explaining about the ,"Big
one that got away."
