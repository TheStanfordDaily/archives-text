# Card Rugby Teams Whip San Francisco Fifteens
## 
### WARREN BREED 
It was a good show all around as i
two Stanford rugby fifteens kept
I their defensive record spotless and j
trounced a pair of the better San J
Francisco teams Saturday afternoon.
Some 500 fans braved sideline mud ;
puddles on the frosh football field to |
witness the season's curtain-raising 1
j double-header* They saw the Pied
j "B" team walk through the Bar-
I barians, 25 to 0, and a little later the <
| "A" team charge to a 20-0 win over j
! the Argonauts.
i Neither fracas could truthfully be |
| called "rugby," as it is played in the
! old country, but the basic funda
mentals were there. For the most. :
past it was a toss-up between thej
American grid game and the mul- j
tiple laterals and free punting of
rugby. The club teams were tie- I
mendously outweighed, and lacked!
the speedy grid offense as shown by !
the Cards.
Midway in the first period of the ;
"A" game a series of rushes and Ar- 1
gonaut fumbles brought the ball
close to scoring territory, where Ray
Lewis took a bucket toss from Sam '
Cockins and twisted his way over |
the line after a 20-yard jaunt. Lewis i
also made the conversion for the
extra points.
The next scoring orgy came in a !
belated second period rally, in which \
three tries were made in rapid sue- i

| cession. Lewis again found himseff
i clear and crossed the line, and again
| made the free place kick.
In another scramble near the Ar
' gonapt goal line Dick Becker, active
I Stanford second-rank man, was sur
prised to find the ball bouncing right
j into his arms, but held onto it and
I scurried through the goal posts.
The last score came late in the day
j as a result of a spectacular 85-yard
J sprint featuring the two speedy var
i sity halfbacks, Joe Vigna and John
I Reisner. Vigna took a lateral from
: the scrum, and ran some 30 yards till
j blocked by Argonaut tacklers, then
j tossed it to Reisner, who easily ouc-
I ran the opposition. Lewis made it an
! even 20 with his fourth perfect con
version. .
Starring in the "B"' game was
j Primo Pinotti, hefty second-rank
! man, who twice giabbed the ball and
crossed the Barb line. George Fuller
| also tallied for the "B's." Jack Wal
! ton and Aylett Cotton grabbed their
share of the standout performances
| in this game.
Card Coach Harry Maloney felt
i that his "B's" showed better form in
J their passing and handling of the
ball, although both teams fumbled
| often and showed ragged and listless
' teamwork. The next few weeks of
j practice will in some degree straight
j en out the difficult passing game.
