## Tennis Competitors Must Sign New Entry List, Says Marvie Kahn 
### Craig Barbash 
With all the intramural standings
of Last quarter now tabulated in En
cina Gymnasium, the winter quar
ter sports were ready to swing into
action today, according to the word
of Marvie Kahn, intramural"man
ager recently returned from "the East,
where he represented Stanford in
the capacity of student body presi
dent.
Entry fists for basketball and ten
nis definitely close today at six. And
league basketball games begin Wed
nesday night in the gym and in the
Pavilion.
Tennis competitors must sign ihe
blue entry list posted on the intra
mural bulletin board in order to be
eligible for intramural competition,
Kahn said. This must be done to
preserve intramural records and
give competitors proper credit for
their participation.
Particularly enthusiastic has been
the turnout for basketball, where GO
teams are expected to compete. The
university champions of last year,
the Graduate School of Business,
will defend its title, and such
league winners as Alpha Delta Phi,
Breakers, Sigma Chi, Los Arcos, and
Theta Chi will be on hand with
strong teams.
Zeta Psi, with a beef trust of five
men and three substitutes, including
three all-American football stars of
the past season, threatens to crush
someone, with weight and prestige,
and likely with scores, in the coming
competition. "Slinger" Dunn and Bob
Reynolds are being held on reserve
for the Zetes, while teammates
Hershey, Moscrip, Erlenheim, Ham
ilton, and Walton soften up the com
petition. The quintet's combined
weight is about half a ton.
Sequoia I, Phi Psiâ€ž Delta Tau
Delta, and others who were contend
ers last year, also threaten with
strong squads in this year's compe
tition.
