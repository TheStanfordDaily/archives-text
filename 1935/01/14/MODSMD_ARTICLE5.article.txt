# Blood Seen On 15 Lindy Kidnap Bills
## State To Use Ladder As Trial Continues 
### 
FLEMINGTON, Jan. 13 (/P). —
Bloodstains, so minute they could
have escaped the naked eye, were
found on 15 of the $10 bills which
were part of the $50,000 Lindbergh
ransom money recovered before
Richard Hauptmann's arrest.
The source which revealed this to
day said the dark brown specs which
appeared on the notes were detected
under a microscope and a chemical
analysis'was made to determine their
substance.
State Pushes Case
When the Department of Justice
re-entered the case, the source said,
one of its first objectives was to
gather all the ransom bills which
had turned up at that time and send
them to Washington for examina
tion.
Confident it has already produced
sufficient evidence against Haupt
mann to convict him of the Lind
bergh kidnap-murder, the state will
pound away through most of this
week with testimony the German
carpenter wrote the 14 ransom notes.
Ladder Is Doubted
Albert Osborn, Sr., handwriting
expert, who has sworn Hauptmann
wrote all the letters, will return 10
the witness stand tomorrow. Six
other experts will follow to corrob
orate his opinion.
With the testimony of the hand
writing experts in the record, the
prosecution will make a fresh effort
to have the so-called kidnap ladder
introduced. The ladder was accepted
as an exhibit for identification, but
the state has failed to prove to the
satisfaction of Justice Trenchard that
the ladder, built in three sections,
actually was used in the abduction.
