### Gordon Frost 
Not content with a 34-18 victory
over Lowell High School of 3an
Francisco Friday night, Coach Jim
mie Bradshaw's frosh basketball
team went back onto the floor Sat
urday evening to whip an even
stronger Marin J.C. quintet, 48-26'.
During the first half of the Loweii
game, the frosh quintet, hindered by
the loss of Bob Zonne who was ill
with the flu, seemed to have diffi
culty in getting started against a
shifty and fast, but smaller, squad. |
Luisetti, who was filling Zonne's
shoes at center instead of playing
his customary forward position,
started a scoring drive which didn't
stop until the local hoopmen had
rolled up a 31-11 score. In the last
few minutes of play the Lowell
! quintet showed a spurt to make the j
I final score read 34-18. Jay De√üiss- j
I chop was high score man for the
I visitors with six points.
j Saturday night, with Zonne back i
at center and Luisetti at forward, !
; ihe Cardinal papooses started off in
I fine style and left the floor af th-3
1 half leading the undefeated Marin
! J.C. team, 24-10. In the middle of
; the second half the local frosh were
| still clicking in good shape but
i seemed unable to lengthen their 14-
i point lead. In the final minutes of)
! the last half the tallies came in faster
and when the final gun sounded the j
i scoreboard stood Stanford 48, Marin !
; J.C. 26.
