# STUDENT BELIEVES SYNDICALISM TRIAL TO BE SIGNIFICANT
## Mitchell Saadi Is Spectator At Session of Court; Talks to Judge 
### John McClelland 
One of the strangest trials in Cali
fornia law history—strange because
it is described by some concerned as
the most important now being con
ducted in the United States and yet
completely ignored by the general
press—this week drags into its
fourth month with the 18 persons on
trial becoming little more than
pawns in a controversy over the
state's criminal syndicalism laws.
Mitchel Saadi, law student, who
attended the last session of the trial
before a characteristic 10-day recess
was called, sees an unusual signifi
cance in the case and describes it as
important as the famous "evolution
trial" of Tennessee some years ago.
Papers Ignore
"The public is almost totally igno
rant of this trial and its significance,"
Saadi explains, "because the news
papers for some ulterior motive have
kept news of it out of their columns.
"And yet at the very bottom of the
controversy is the age-old question
of freedom of speech. These people
who are on trial face maximum .sen
tences of 84 years apiece for believ
ing in certain doctrines in their at
tempt to form a labor union."
In Recess Nrtw
On the bench at the trial is Judge
Lemmon, a Stanford graduate, who
told Saadi that letters were pouring
in to him from persons hearing about
the trial, asking that the case be
dropped. One letter even threatened
his life, he said.
Right now the trial is in recess. The
prosecutor who started the case was
defeated in the recent elecUon. The
new prosecutor asked for a week to
review the case. The defense ob
jected, but upon hearing that an
important person sympathetic to
them would be in the district soon,
changed their minds and raised the
request for recess to 10 days.
Passes During War
The criminal syndicalism laws, the
value of which is the vital question
in the trial, were passed during the
war. The state has never bothered
to repeal them. They provide that a
person Is committing a criminal of
fense if he lets it be known that lie
believes in any kind of an over
throw of the present order of gov
ernment. In recent months the law
has been put to use principally as a
means of charging alleged Commun
ists in connection with strikes.
Saadi, who is an ardent advocate
of free speech, foresees enormous
significance in the case should the
defense be acquitted.
Free Speech at Stake
"If the case comes out in favor of
the defense, it will mean that it has
been shown that a person has the
right to speak, preach, or publish
any of his views in this state that
do not commit libel. It will mean
that although the law is still on the
books, a representative body of citi
zens (the jury) have declared it is
not wanted*
"I don't know whether these peo
ple in Sacramento are guilty or not.
I am only interested in the theory
that the law is wrong and will in
evitably bring about more evils."
