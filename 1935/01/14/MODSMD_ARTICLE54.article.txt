# DR. WILLIS SURE PROJECTED PIER WILL BE UNSAFE
## Expert Emeritus Geologist Reasserts Plea That Builders Ignored 
### 
Despite the fact that Golden Gate
Bridge engineers claim to have drill
ed several hundred feet under the
south pier foundation and not found
sandstone, Dr. Bailey Willis, emeri
tus professor of geology, still thinks
it's there.
Dr. Willis is convinced that the
bridge, if built according to present
plans, will be unsafe. Not unsafe
only in the event of an earthquake,
but liable to be destroyed by' a slip
of its foundation at any time. Says
Dr. Willis: "Only two things can
make the south pier foundation safe.
It must be built either on the solid
sandstone "which I am sure lies
somewhere under it, or, if il be built
on the pudding.stone above the sand
stone, it must be sunk to the level
of the channel, about 350 feet below
sea level."
Dr. Willis pointed out lhat be
cause of the expansion in the steel
cables anchored to the top of the
south pier, the pier each ch;y would
be rocked back and forth on it.s
foundations. This rocking would be
great enough to raise the height of
the bridge in the center eight or nine
feet. The pier acts as lever, rocking
.its foundation of concrete in the pud
dingstone in which it is buried. This
puddingstone is of a consistency very
much like its namesakeâ€”pudding.
Rocking will produce an inevitable
weakening in the soft stone, fol
lowed by a fatal slide, Dr. Willis
thinks.
Willis submitted his report to the
building committee of the bridge di
rectorate last November. He has
heard nothing from them since then.
They have made no public report on
his paper nor taken any action to re
vise the plans he criticized. And he
is still convinced that they are build
ing an unsafe bridge.
