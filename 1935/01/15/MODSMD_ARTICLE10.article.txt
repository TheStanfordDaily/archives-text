# LIBERALISM IS LECTURE TOPIC
## Harvard Divinity Dean To Speak Tuesday Night 
### 
"The Outlook for Liberalism" will!
be Ihe subject of a lecture by Dr. j
Willard L. Sperry, dean of the Divin- :
ity School at Harvard University, l
who is scheduled to speak tonight at.
7:30 o'clock in the Assembly Hall,
under the auspices of the Commit
tee on Public Exercises. Dr. Sperry 1
spoke briefly during chapei services !
last Sunday.
Dr. Sperry considers the tempo
rary eclipse of political liberalism :
"one of the striking facts of our day."' j
He believes that in England the lib
eral party is, for the moment, com
pletely disorganized and without
leadership, while in America, "al
though there has never been a lib
eral party as such, the liberal tradi
tion is being challenged." In both j
countries the present tendencies ar ? j
toward either conservatism or radi- '
callsm.
Theologically speaking, Dr. Sperry j
holds that the term "liberalism" has |
been widely misused. "It probably ,
gains its clearest meaning," he says,
"when it is construed as being the
theological counter-part of the po
litical movement bearing the sam'.-
name. So construed liberalism is;
faith in man and a primary concern
for man's affairs."
Dr. Sperry is not uknown at Stan
ford. He has held the position of col
lege chaplain at this university, n.s
well as at Yale, Amherst, Williams,
Brown, Bowdoin, Wellesley, Smith, I
Vassal", Mt. Holyoke, and the Uni- j
versity of Chicago.
He has long belonged to Ihe Union ]
Boat Club of Boston, and rowed for '
three years on his college crew at
Oxford, where he was a Rhodes j
scholar from Michigan.
