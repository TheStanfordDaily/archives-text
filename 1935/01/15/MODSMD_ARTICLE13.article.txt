### 
The "GifTasmile Club" has a new I
recipe today for boys who want to j
be smirking their way through col - |
lege, according to G. Arkley Steed- |
man, 'chief giffersmiler. The way to j
do it, according to the chief, is to j
rattle 16 coppers on the Chappie i
lending library desk next Thursday i
morning for the "Old Timers" nuni- !
ber.
Gord. A. Steedman, who is also j
Old Boy, points out that he do,es not j
expect people to rattle coppers in
Palo Alto, or else the people may lind j
themselves niggardly on the wood
pile.'
G. A. (Graduate in Arkeyology) !
Steedman points out that he has!
assembled an amazing collection of !
rare old wit and humor.
"The Rise and Decline of G. Wash- :
burn Sidcburn," a mellifluous, and j
versimilitudinous discourse en rap- j
port to the rise and decline of G.

jaded financier who gets himself re
juvenated and goes to college and j
applies big business methods in j
working his way through school.
