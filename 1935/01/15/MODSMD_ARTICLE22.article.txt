### 
LONDON, Jan. 14 (>P).—Great
Britain is willing to enter 'i swap
ping deal with Germany—the ab
rogation of the military clauses of
the Versailles treaty —in return
for German whole-hearted partici
pation in a general pact for the
limitation of armament.
This announcement came from an
authoritative source after the British
Cabinet mot today arid review the
European outlook in the light of the
improved atmosphere resulting Irom
the Franco-Italian agreement of
Rome last month and yesterday's
plebiscite by which, it was conceded,

union with Germany.
France Backs England '
It was understood, following the
Cabinet meeting, that the British
Cabinet was informed the French
government of Premier Flandin in
tended to he more liberal toward
Germany and actually stood ready
to accept Germany's purported ille
gal armament as legal.
(Under the Treaty of Versailles of
fensive weapons were forbidden Ger
many, but during recent months both
Great Britain and France have ac
cused Germany of acquiring such
armaments "illegally.")
May Rejoin League
With these indications of amity
as a guidepost, the British laid plans
to revive Great Britain's efforts to
bring Germany back into the fold at
Geneva.
It was understood tonight that,
as an initial step, the British Cab
inet decided the League Council
should make all possible haste in
returning the Saar to Germany as
a result of what is supposed to be
an overwhelming vote in (he Saar
in favor of return. It was indicated
that the Cabinet hopes this terri
tory may be reunited with the
Reich within the next few days if
possible.
Although, under the Treaty of Ver
sailles, the League has the right to
split up the Saar, retaining districts
which give a majority of their votes
in favor of the status quo, or even
giving districts' to France if any
voted that way, it was stated offi
cially that the Cabinet would oppose
such division as "impractical."

who returned from Geneva just be
fore the Cabinet session and con
ferred with Prime Minister J. Ram
sey Mac Donald before the Cabinet
Ministers met, is expected to go back
to Geneva at the end of the week.
