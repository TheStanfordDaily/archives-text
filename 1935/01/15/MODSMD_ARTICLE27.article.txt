## Observers Use Binocular To Estimate Ballots From Balcony BALLOTS THROWN OUT Anti-Nazi Move Is Called To Protect Vote

SAARBRUECKEN, Jan. 14 (yp).~
Anti-Hitler forces in the Saar were
called upon tonight to .resist to tho
uttermost any attempt to join the
Saar to Germany on the basis of
the plebiscite vote to stage demon
strations everywhere in the terri
tory at 10 a.m. tomorrow.
SAARBRUECKEN, Jan. 14 (/P).~
Conclusive vote for Germany in the
historic Saar plebiscite—possibly 80
or 90 per cent of the 500,000 total—
was apparent to mix,t spectators
scanning tabulations through spy
glasses from the balcony of Wartburg
hall tonight.
During two and a half hours of
tabulation in plain view of the world
press and representative of all fac
tions, a "sampling" of ballot piles on
47 tables spread out below, seen
through opera glasses, yielded an
estimate that Germany was averag
ing 85 per cent, status quo about 14
per cent, and votes favoring union
with France about 1 per cent.
Prepare for Refugees
That the result of the vote was not
held in doubt was indicated in ad
vices from the French frontier that
cities in that region had begun
stocking up provisions for an influx
of Saar refugees— opponents of the
Hitler regime — as soon as the re
sults of the plebiscite are officially
announced at 8 a.m. tomorrow (11
o'clock tonight, Pacific time.)
These refugees are expected to
number 40,000, according to Fcneh
estimates. Preparations were being
made to house and feed them tem
porarily. Their absorption into
France was expected to add meas
urably to that nation's unemploy
ment difficulties.
Whether 70, 80, or 90 per cent of
the plebiscite votes favored return
of the rich Saar mining territory to
Germany was still a question, but
nobody viewing the tabulation tables,
on which the ballot marking under
neutral tabulators was easily visible,
could escape the impression that a
big Nazi majority was piling up.
Revolver Confiscated
A fairly accurate "long-distance"
view of one of the tables showed a
tremendous majority given Ger
many by the border district of Eb.s
bach-Reisweiler. The count was
3095 votes for Germany, 144 votes
for status quo, and 5 for France, with
about 50 ballots thrown out.
Diligent guards at the door con
fiscated a revolver found ui the
pocket of an editor of the Socialist
Voikcsstinime as he entered the
building. The German Front is
sued a proclamation claiming a
90 per cent vote for "our eternal
Germany."
After two and a half hours so
many spectators in the gallery above
the counting arena were using
glasses that the president of the
commisison arose and banged the
table, announcing that gallery spec
tators must refrain from telescopic
tabulating.
