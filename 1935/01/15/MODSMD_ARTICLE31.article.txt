# Gosh, Poor Stanford!

Students of Stanford University, who are
excused it they have always regarded them
selves with a certain esteem as being part of
Ihe celebrated upper Jive per eent, may he
surprised and shocked to learn tJial I hey have
committed a grave error in choosing Stanford
as their alma mater. Yes, they lowered them
selves in coming to an institution that turns
out great I'ooihaJl players, trackmen, and golf
ers, and comparatively damn few scholars.
For so says in effect President Rogers
Embree of the .Julius Kosenwald Foundation
when he ranks American universities on their
educational values. The twelve best in this
respect, says Embree, are Harvard^Columbia,
Chicago, YaJe, California, Minnesota, Cornell,
Michigan, Wisconsin, lowa, Princeton, and
Johns Hopkins.
The defect in these ratings exists in the fact
that no one knows what the critics employed
as criteria. Is a school's educational value
measured by tJie number and erudition of
treatises published by its students, Ihe rank
and prominence of its professors, its size, its
discoveries in research; or by the, public life
of its graduates, their culture, usefulness to
the community, and ability to master and
enjoy life?
Not to include these latter qualities in an
educational values yardstick would be lik
ened to rating a football team merely on the
size of its member's chest expansion, the color
of their jerseys, or the numlxT of cleats in
their shoes. It would tie counting only poten
tialities and not personal merit and achieve
ments.
We trust Ihmt J)r. Wilbur and the Hoard of
I'rustees are not upset. Despite its thousand
and one shortcomings, despite our wonder
ment at what college is all about, we still be
lieve one can learn as much about life on this
side of the bay as in Berkeley. Mr. Embree,
your rating is just a large chunk of limhiirgcr.
