When the New Deal administration some months
ago announced that it intended to launch a mammoth
forestry project with a 100-mile belt of trees -extendiivt;
from Canada to the Texas panhandle, skeptics laughed.
It was feasible for the government to tight bank fail
ures, languishing business, unemployment, and excess
cotton and hogs, but to start a battle against the ele
ments —flood, wind, and drouth—seemed a bit absurd.
Skeptics may now straighten their faoes for the
government is actually making plans for the man-made
forest and experts have pronounced the plan sound.
A 100-mile strip through the Dakotas, Nebraska,
Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas has been selected. Each
od 30 planting areas calls for the planting of 39,000
trees in strips five miles long and 10 rods wide. Mean
while, the forest service has collected sufficient seed
of acclimated species to provide about 100,000,000
seedlings for planting in 1936. Designed to provide
windbreaks for cultivated land, to give off moisture
in time of drouth and to hold the moisture in the
ground in time of heavy rains, the project was en
dorsed by President Roosevelt and set in motion with
an allotment of $1,000,000 last year.
Botany Professor Leßoy Abrams, who is actively
interested in forest trees, is one of those who pro
nounces the project sound, provided it is continually
conducted by capable hands.
"I was through that mid-west district this summer,"
Professor Abrams said, "and I can see where great
belts of trees would do a great deal of good. For
example, if strips of timber were planted across the
many fertile river valleys the wind breaks provided
would be a real boon to the farmers."
"Of course this plan is one for the future. And
it is an experiment. Another generation will have
to pass before results can be seen."
Professor Abrams believes that mid-west farm
lands are being "used up" and that forests will aid
in restoring and preserving fertility. Of the benefits
of the proposed project he says:
"The chief virtue of the forest belt would l>e as
a wind-break. It would also have some value in
preserving moisture during the summers. But Uve
belief that forests would bring more rain is very
questionable.
Professor Abrams has confidence in the project
chiefly because of the capable hands in which it has
been placed. The government has had men in .the Gobi
Desei-t studying forestry in dry climes to aid in plan
ning for the mid-west project.
Of course there are many obstacles to be overcome.
There is the land to be bought or leased and the prob
lem of protecting the young trees while they are
maturing. And the million dollars already appropriated
will not last long.
The government is looking at least 50 years ahead
as it plans the great tree belt. But it will out-live
the originators and if culminated will be a reality
when NRA and its alphabetical cousins are mere
history.

When the New Deal administration some months
ago announced that it intended to launch a mammoth
forestry project with a 100-mile belt of trees -extendiivt;
from Canada to the Texas panhandle, skeptics laughed.
It was feasible for the government to tight bank fail
ures, languishing business, unemployment, and excess
cotton and hogs, but to start a battle against the ele
ments —flood, wind, and drouth—seemed a bit absurd.
Skeptics may now straighten their faoes for the
government is actually making plans for the man-made
forest and experts have pronounced the plan sound.
A 100-mile strip through the Dakotas, Nebraska,
Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas has been selected. Each
od 30 planting areas calls for the planting of 39,000
trees in strips five miles long and 10 rods wide. Mean
while, the forest service has collected sufficient seed
of acclimated species to provide about 100,000,000
seedlings for planting in 1936. Designed to provide
windbreaks for cultivated land, to give off moisture
in time of drouth and to hold the moisture in the
ground in time of heavy rains, the project was en
dorsed by President Roosevelt and set in motion with
an allotment of $1,000,000 last year.
Botany Professor Leßoy Abrams, who is actively
interested in forest trees, is one of those who pro
nounces the project sound, provided it is continually
conducted by capable hands.
"I was through that mid-west district this summer,"
Professor Abrams said, "and I can see where great
belts of trees would do a great deal of good. For
example, if strips of timber were planted across the
many fertile river valleys the wind breaks provided
would be a real boon to the farmers."
"Of course this plan is one for the future. And
it is an experiment. Another generation will have
to pass before results can be seen."
Professor Abrams believes that mid-west farm
lands are being "used up" and that forests will aid
in restoring and preserving fertility. Of the benefits
of the proposed project he says:
"The chief virtue of the forest belt would l>e as
a wind-break. It would also have some value in
