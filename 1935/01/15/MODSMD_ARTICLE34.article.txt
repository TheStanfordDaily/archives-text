# OUR HASHER SEZ:

### 
The Tri Delts
Garnered some pelts.
The Kappas
Are happas.
The Deegees
Were pleegees.
Among the Chi O's
Were many "Oh My-os."

So endeth the reading of the Genethith, and the
beginning of the Exodus from Roble.
i Public aenemics Nos. 1 and 2 are two roughs who
dressed up in girls' clothes ("belonging to a certain
! Roble sponsor), and went up "the river" during the
height of the jonquil fever, and walked up to various
I houses while the pledges were still outstanding, and got
| themselves kissed. But the girls began to get suspi
j cious, and yanked off their faked curls.
The Gamma <Phi Betas
Got some heavy detas.
First official approval of the new class was given
by Wong, the Chinese cook, who said: "Girls good
| look. Hashboy talk too muchee." Hong, the second boy,
j said: "Bum sing."
The hashers again came through in a time of crisis,
: during the pledge jolly-ups, when they danced with all
j the pledges four or five times, made love to the house
[ mother six or seven times, and told the house presi
' dent her hair "looked beautiful tonight" eight or ten
times.
Carl Schott, who at various times has been nick -
named "Big" or "Half," did something, which confi
! dential advisers to the secretary of Miss Stevens of
the A.S.S.U. office, said would never happen. Schoit,
being a Phi Delt sophomore, had the duty with three
other sophs of lugging home the Phi Delt train bell,
which the Chi O's had borrowed to "Ring out the old,
ring in the new."
Since Schott believes in the benefits of sleep for
beautiful bodies, he was a late riser Sunday morning.
When the time came around to get the bell, he was
still, shall we say, in a condition of dishabille. In
other words, he walked into the Chi O parlor dressed
in pajamas and a dressing gown, while the girls tittered
prettily. At least that is an unfounded rumor.
