# Chips From The Records

(Editor's Note: This is the first of a series of
reviews of the classical recording programs played
each Thursday afternoon hi room X 4. Today's article
reviews last Thursday's recital.)
The new recording of Brahms' Fourth, and, for
many, his greatest symphony, is a great achievement.
Bruno Walter succeeds in dispelling the old canards as
to Brahms' "muddy" and "turgid" orchestration, and
the whole performance sparkles with brilliance and
clarity. Verve and dramatic intensity distinguish the
reading of the first and third movements, poetic lyri
cism suffuses the Andante with the Phrygian mode
theme, and the monumental finale is done with a fine
sense of line and classic proportion.
Thomas' singing of "Steal Away" brings us an ex
ample of negro folk music at its best. The freedom
of the artist's delivery, not exaggerated in this case,
shows the affinity of negro spirituals with medieval
plain song.
Heifetz, playing an old rondo by Hummel, revivifies
what might easily be a mere "museum piece." The
historic interest of this little gem, a perfect example
of the old rondo form, makes it an ideal record for
students of musical appreciation.
The Dvorak scherzo capriceioso is ;i mark seldom
heard, but Ormandy and his Minneapolis orchestra fill
up two sides of an interesting disc with sparkling music
that i.s well worth reviving.
