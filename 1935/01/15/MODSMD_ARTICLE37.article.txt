# Quake Saves '06 Class Pain of Passing Finals
## 
### SALLIE TABER 
Students who rest on past laurels
and put off writing term papers un
til the last week can desperately
hope they will not have to pay the
price of their procrastination. This
year the chances are better than they
have been since 1906 that nature in
the guise of an earthquake may in
tervene opportunely in their behalf.
The University is situated on water
soaked soil which would vibrate like
a bowl of jelly under the impetus of
a sudden jar, and lately many re
corded jars have made the earth
shiver slightly.
The class of the memorable year
of 1906 graduated without passing
through the ordeal of finals. Be
cause of the chaos following the ar
rival of the shock in the early morn
ing of April 18, it was impossible 1o
reorganize the courses before com
mencement, which at that time was
in May. Consequently everyone who
had come out in mid-terms with a
C average was allowed to graduate.
Many curious stories are told of
people's narrow escapes from death.
A student who was delivering milk

' to a house in Paly had just set the
bottles down on the doorstep when
the chimney toppled over and milk
| stained a pair of flying heels. In
Roble the bed of a sleeping maiden
fell into the shaft of a collapsed
chimney and girl and bed were neat
ly lowered one floor. Bringing death
ito Encina, an avalanche of bricks
crushed the life from the body of a
freshman.
i Financial ruin threatened the Uni
versity when many of the beautiful,
newly completed- buildings were ir
reparably damaged. A bit of melo
drama was injected into the tragedy
! by the demolition of the insane asy
lum at Agnew.
j Stanford men, however, met the
crisis with their customary valor,
| one group going to San Francisco
I to render aid to the stricken inhab
itants, and the other remaining on
the campus to ward off the invasion
I of homicidal maniacs and criminals
| who were sypposed to be plundering
the countryside. Although this latter
group'had many false alarms, it was
not called upon to do physical com
i bat to protect its fair charges.
