; "BRIGHT EYES"
; A( the Stanford Theatre
j Obviously written especially for
1 five - year - old Shirley Temple.
| "Bright Eyes," melodramatic, trite,
using all the old tear jerker tricks of
the movie trade, somehow manages
to click despite all that. Perhaps it
is because the
picture gives
Miss Temple a
chance not only
to sparkle in her
c h a r a c teristic
fashion, but also
to prove that a
year's experi
ence in the cinema has developed
her into something more than a
charming child—a real little actress
with an understanding beyond her
years and an ability to catch the au
dience up into her own emotions
with a mere gesture and a surprising
command of facial expression.
But despite Miss Temple's talent.
Jane Withers, an eight-year-old
newcomer, as the brat who makes
life # miserable for all about her, al
most manages to steal the picture
from the star.
Good shot: Jane Withers showing
Shirley Temple how to play "train
wreck." —Dodds
