# CAMPUS OPINION
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Such notoriety as that incited by
! ihe recent protests of the Syndical
ism law should move members of
Stanford University and citizens 01
this community to an expression of
disapproval. However fallible this
law may be, it remains law,* and no
amount of unrestrained and demon
strative emotionalism is going to ei
lect its reform. Such typically adol
escent displays, when sanctioned by
Stanford University professors and
; students, can result in nothing but a
leversed opinion on the part of the
I public that university people are
both intelligent and discriminating
gentlemen.
i Surely we all agree that our gov
-1 eminent should be one by the people
and for the people and that public
opinion is a feature of our plan of
government, but the means by whicrt
our government ideals should be
realized find varied expressions in
individuals, some thoughtful and
constructive—others radical and det
rimental to any possible realization
of our efforts. Although many of our
eminent thinkers hold liberal views.,
their methods of imparting them to
the public are so entirely different
from the means employed by" our
would-be intellectuals that their
common goal is obscured by the con
tinual difficulties into which the lat
ter find themselves with the courts of
justice.
As members of our reputedly en
lightened community we should do
our share in preserving the Amer
ican standards of citizenship by re
fusing to tolerate individuals or
groups of individuals who sanction
I such primitive and un-American
1 policies. i

(Editor's Note: Every man stu
dent is now paying $1 per quar
\ ter (S3 per year) plus hit. $1 to
' the Stanford Union (which goes
indirectly to the Theatre Fund),
plus the original Stanford Pavil
ion Fund $1, making a total of $9
! annually per person. Women du
j plicate this with the exception of
( their Women's Clubhouse $1 fee
| which does not go to the Theatre
Fund. The Daily's belief is that
the students are entitled to voice
their opinion in this matter, and is
awaiting campus opinion.)
The Editor, Sir:
I think it litting at this time to
! expose other views concerning the
monumental extra 15 cents which
the Ex Committee granted The Daily
last quarter. You know yourself, at
the time the grant was allowed, it
was understood (even by you) that
when the added amount was granted
it was up to the staff to prove to the
student body and the Ex Committee
that a much finer paper could be
presented. Congratulations are in
order—the paper certainly has been
; interesting and enjoyable and has
; shown marked improvement.
On the other hand, Ed., you know
| that The Daily subsidization has
i naturally increased with the greater
student enrollment this year. Adver
tising is doing well, and The Daily is
in fine financial shape. I sincerely
believe that this is true. It is not
the desire of the Ex Committee to
limit the finances of an important
student activity—probably the mos;
important.
Before you were editor you re •
newed interest in the New Theatre
movement. I am sure the campus
appreciates your efforts. Now that
the construction of the New Theatre
is almost a certainty, we must watch
our student income more closely.
If taking away the temporary
grant should result in a poorer
Daily, I would be the first one to
j champion the cause of allowing the
i grant to be permanent. But if the
paper can maintain its present high
standard without the extra money,
then this amount should be directed
i into the worthwhile Theatre Fund.
There have been rumors that
many students, desire to put this
problem up for student vote in Feb
ruary. If the rumors are true, I am
sure that the Ex Committee would
! be more than happy to place such a
proposition on the ballot. After all.
[ it is the student's money, and al

though a vote may not h*> w sure—fire
method, and sometimes is a compli
cated procedure to obtain the
results, the students will be allowed
to voice their opinions. The Daily
might find it worthwhile to sound
out the student body.
Wishing The Daily continued suc
cess, and with a sincere desire to
effect a rapid, reasonable decision of
this issue, I close (without a head
ache). Marvie Kahn.

The Editor, Sir:
I think it litting at this time to
! expose other views concerning the
monumental extra 15 cents which
the Ex Committee granted The Daily
last quarter. You know yourself, at
the time the grant was allowed, it
was understood (even by you) that
when the added amount was granted
it was up to the staff to prove to the
student body and the Ex Committee
that a much finer paper could be
presented. Congratulations are in
order—the paper certainly has been
; interesting and enjoyable and has
; shown marked improvement.
On the other hand, Ed., you know
| that The Daily subsidization has
i naturally increased with the greater
student enrollment this year. Adver
tising is doing well, and The Daily is
in fine financial shape. I sincerely
believe that this is true. It is not
the desire of the Ex Committee to
limit the finances of an important
student activity—probably the mos;
important.
Before you were editor you re •
newed interest in the New Theatre
movement. I am sure the campus
appreciates your efforts. Now that
the construction of the New Theatre
is almost a certainty, we must watch
our student income more closely.
If taking away the temporary
grant should result in a poorer
Daily, I would be the first one to
j champion the cause of allowing the
i grant to be permanent. But if the
paper can maintain its present high
standard without the extra money,
then this amount should be directed
i into the worthwhile Theatre Fund.
There have been rumors that
many students, desire to put this
problem up for student vote in Feb
ruary. If the rumors are true, I am
sure that the Ex Committee would
! be more than happy to place such a
proposition on the ballot. After all.
[ it is the student's money, and al

though a vote may not h*> w sure—fire
method, and sometimes is a compli
cated procedure to obtain the
results, the students will be allowed
to voice their opinions. The Daily
might find it worthwhile to sound
out the student body.

this issue, I close (without a head

appreciates your efforts. Now that
the construction of the New Theatre
is almost a certainty, we must watch
our student income more closely.
If taking away the temporary
grant should result in a poorer
Daily, I would be the first one to
j champion the cause of allowing the
i grant to be permanent. But if the
paper can maintain its present high
standard without the extra money,
then this amount should be directed
i into the worthwhile Theatre Fund.
There have been rumors that
many students, desire to put this
problem up for student vote in Feb
ruary. If the rumors are true, I am
sure that the Ex Committee would
! be more than happy to place such a
proposition on the ballot. After all.
[ it is the student's money, and al

though a vote may not h*> w sure—fire
method, and sometimes is a compli
cated procedure to obtain the
results, the students will be allowed
to voice their opinions. The Daily
might find it worthwhile to sound
out the student body.
Wishing The Daily continued suc
cess, and with a sincere desire to
effect a rapid, reasonable decision of
this issue, I close (without a head
ache). Marvie Kahn.
