# CARD HOOPSTERS OUT TO END BEAR WINNING STREAK
## Quintet Invades Berkeley Friday Intent On Breaking Jinx 
### 
Today Ihe Cardinal Hoopsters be
gin another drive to win a series
from the Golden Bears, a feat which
has not been accomplished within
the docade and which will open this
Friday night in the Edwards Gym
nasium in Berkeley.
Yesterday the first five did not
report for practice, taking instead a
much needed rest. Although their
speed, passing, and shooting in the
Trojan series were top-notch, it was
obvious thai the Cards had not yet
fully recovered from the strenuous
Midwest trip, but the Sunday-Mon
day lay-off should leave the first
string with the usual pep and stam
ina..
Scrimmage Held
Coach John Burin gave the rest of
the squad an easy afternoon, how
ever, as the second and third string
scrimmaged against the reserves,
who were playing the California
style of offense.
Burin knows well enough that the
Golden Bears, whom the Indians
will meet Friday night, will not be
the set-up that Cal's mediocre prac
tice season would seem to indicate.
Coach Nibs Price has always brought
his U.C. basketball teams along
slowly, and this season a finished
winning quintet was not worked out
until last Saturday night when the
Bears came back after losing the
opener 35-24 to decisively defeat the
U.C.L.A. cagers, by a 38-26 margin.
Big Oave Absent
Chiefly hindering Cal's progress
was the absence of Big Dave Meek,
captain and veteran center, who had
been vacationing in Hawaii with the
Bear football eleven. Meek finally
hit his stride Saturday night to lead
the Bears in scoring with 11 points.
At forwards Price will have Ray
Olson and Jack Kopke, the combina
tion which started both Bruin games.
Olson was substitute for Captain Hal
Eifert last season, and consequently
did not play much basketball,
though enough to prove himself a
shifty and sharpshooting forward as
tar as the opponents were concerned.
Kopke is a new name in California
basketball, but a 20-point scoring
total for the last St. Mary's-Cal
game has made the forward a favo
rite with Bear fans.
The guard positions are still open,
with Bob Herwig, Bob Feihng, and
Ritchie I lay the favorites.
