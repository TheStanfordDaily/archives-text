# SACRAMENTO TILT NEXT FOR BABES
## 
### 
With their two stellar players still !
out of uniform, Stanford's frosh j
basketball squad started practice i
last night for their game Saturday'
night with the Sacramento High
School quintet. Friday night the j
frosh hoopmen have no tilt sched- j
uled.
While "Coach Jimmie Bradshaw
was coaching his team-mates through j
a 30-minute scrimmage session last j
night, Hank Luisetti, who scored 35 !
points in the week-eud's games, was j
being treated by the doctor for a j
strained ankle and shoulder injuries
received in last Saturday night's;
game. Luisetti received several bad j
bumps during that encounter and j
was unable to raise his arms above 1
his head yesterday afternoon as the j
result of shoulder bruises.
Bob Zonne, who was taken ill with i
the flu last Thursday but was able to |
play Saturday night, is still suffering ,
with his "cold" and will not join his j
team-mates for their daily workouts j
until the latter part of the week.
Both Luisetti and Zonne are ex
pected to be in shape for next Satur- [
day night's encounter.
Bradshaw was extremely pleased i
with his team's showing last week- !
end as far as rebound play was con
cerned but explained that he is still |
dissatisfied with the papooses' of
fensive showing. The week's prac
tice sessions will be characterized by
blackboard chalk talks and offensive
scrimmage drills.
