# NEVERS' TEAM NOW COMPLETED
## 
### 
With the arrival of a set of Chi-
I cago Card gridders, Ernie Nevers'
I roster was completed, and the former
( Stanford all-time fullback ran his
, men through a stiff workout here in
I preparation for the New York Giants
; game at Kezar next Sunday for
! Knights of Columbus charity.
Nevers is still trying to get hold
j of Homer Griffiths, Trojan power-
I house of 1933, and now a success in
I pro ranks. His team, in the work-
I outs here of the past few days, has
shown great facility in a wide-open
! and sure-shot passing game.
Two of the Chicago pros arriving
: were Bernie Hughes, Oregon center,
! and Phil Sarboe, W.S.C. quarter.
A hitch from the Giants camp in
j dicated that Harry Newman, Michi
| gan all-American, would not be able
|to play. His place will be taken by
| Willis Smith, the 146-pound flash
I from Idaho.
