## SPORTING INTEREST SWINGS TO VARIETY 
### 
"Spoii for sport's sake," the thorn- 1
of most of the criticisms for the way
college football is run, is slowly but |
definitely being realized, facts, fig- j
ures, and general indications all over
the country show.
Attendance, participation, and in
terest have switched somewhat from
football, professional baseball, and
boxing in the past five years to the
so-called minor spoils. This chang
ing trend is evident at Stanford just
as clearly.
With the football tea in that 1
should have drawn the biggest 1
crowds of the modern era this
year, the Indian stadium never :
came so close to drawing capacity
crowds as i( did in the Big Games
of IU2S-29. The 1Â»33 Big Game, a
natural from nearly every aspect,
should have completely sold out,
but there were many scattered va
cant seats.
In spite of this, however, Stanford
led the country in the matter of at
tendance for the 1934 season.
The old "million dollar gate" in j
boxing is relegated to the history
books, and the professional baseball '
leagues have been tottering a bit in
the past two or three seasons.
Concerning the money sports, all, j
of course, have suffered from the de- [
pression; but professional football, a |
comparatively new event, ice hotkey :
m the East, and wrestling have been i
hit less than the old standbys.
