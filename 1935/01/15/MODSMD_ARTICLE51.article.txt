# LARGE NUMBER TAKE PART IN SPORTS HERE
## 
### 
Harry Maloney, director of minor |
sports at Stanfoi-d, estimated thai !
about GO per cent of the men stu- i
cients here actively participate in i
organized athletics on the campus,
and about 15 per cent more take par!
in informal sport.
This figure has remained essen- i
tially constant for several years, but j
the increased participation in the j
minor sports has been noticeable, I
Maloney said.
Attendance and general campus j
interest has grown gradually but
surely, and now the more important
games draw much larger crowds than j
they did three or four years ago in j
soccer, Maloney pointed out.
The same holds true of boxing, i
wrestling, water polo, rugby, and j
tennis. Water polo lias been one o£ j
the most rapidly growing s|»orts,
from the interest standpoint. Its
growth has rather handicapped
swimming, and that division lias |
made no noticeable gain.
Rugby ha.s "taken" peculiarly well
at Stanford, Maloney believes, and
he pointed out that this was prob
ably because both the sport itself,
and its modern revival were pio
neered here.
