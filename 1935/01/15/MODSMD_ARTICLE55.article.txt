As is the case with major league
baseball averages, nothing in intra
mural track is official until the final
check-up, so that belated results to
day revealed Alpha Delta Phi win
ner of the University championship,
which produced one official and
three unofficial records.
A pole vault of 12 feet 3 inches
by Van Rensselaer Ginn set the
official record. While Philip Levy
with a 149-foot 2-inch toss of the
discus; Humbert Smith, with a high
jump of 6 feet 4V2 inches; and Dave
Devlin, with a mark of 10 minutes
:3 seconds in the two-mile, set un
official marks. Ginn's affiliation with
Los Arcos caused his record's ac

qualify their records under intra
mural rulings.
The Alpha Delts' 49 points easily
carried the meet Over El Toro,
