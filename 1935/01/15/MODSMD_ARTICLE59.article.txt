WASHINGTON, Jan. 14 (/P). —In
its first direct attack on the Roose
| velt Administration, the American
| Liberty League asserted today that
"tjiree features of the federal bud
i get for the fiscal year 1936 are of a
I highly disturbing character."
Jauett Shouse, league president,
! has reiterated that the organization,
| which includes Alfred E. Smith and
! John W. Davis among its founders,
j was not anti-new deal. But the criti
i cal statement issued today caused
i little surprise in or out of Adminis
i tration circles.
j The league listed the three "dis
turbing" budget factors as:
1. A return to a level of regular
expenditures as high as that which
early in the depression occasioned a
nation-wide revolt.
2. A prospective increase in the
public debt by nearly two and a hall
billion dollars beyond the point
which the people were told a year
ago should mark the end of contin
ued Treasury deficits.
3. A huge emergency fund which
j permits executive allotments with-
I out adequate legislative direction for
j public works projects which may
| lack economic justification and may
| not accomplish the purpose foi
I which they are intended.
