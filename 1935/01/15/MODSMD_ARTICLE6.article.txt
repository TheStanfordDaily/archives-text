below zero at Bern id ji.
It was only six degrees lower in
Canada's coldest spot of the day, the
outpost of Moonsonee on an arm of
Hudson Bay in Ontario.
Two men died, one frozen and the
other a traffic accident victim, in
Minnesota, and a 15-year-old young
ster was frozen to death in a shack
at Symerton, 111., his body still un

Snow ten inches deep blocked
secondary highways in Wisconsin
and Minnesota, and more snow was
forecast for Tuesday.
Chill winds carried the cold wave
into Michigan, Indiana, and Ohio,
where temperatures from 5 to 15
degrees below zero was predicted for
the night. Light snow fell at Detroit,
and two inches were reported at
Cleveland. Inaugural crowds.stood
in bleak winds and snow flurries at
