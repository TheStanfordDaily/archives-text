# Manufacturers Propose Ban on General Strikes
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 14 (/P).â€”The
National Association of Manufactur
ers intends to propose legislation
this winter to ban general and sym
pathetic strikes.
Association officials announced
this plan tonight along with their
opposition to both the proposed
Wagner labor disputes bill and sug
gested legislation to unionize indus
try by placing it under a labor law
similar to the railway labor act. The
bill the association has in mind
would be similar to the British
trades disputes act of 1927.
