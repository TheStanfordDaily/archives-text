SAARBRUECKEN, Jan. 15 (A J >. -
Nazis late tonight were .still whoop
ing it up over their crushing victory
in Sunday's plebiscite while the few
thousands who opposed reunion with
Germany awaited expected reprisals
in fear and trembling.
As Adolf Hitler's supporters, exu
berant over having polled 477,119 of
the 525,756 valid votes cast, seized
control of the Saarbruecken police
force, Socialists, Communists; and
others who voted for continuance of
League of Nations suzerainty plead
ed with league governing commis
sion for protection.
Refugees Expected
Along the French frontier the
regular force of gendarmes was
strengthened as border residents
feared trouble from the Nazis cele
brating their victory. A wave of
refugees was expected, but at dusk
tonight official estimates of such
persons crossing the frontier varied
from 100 to 400.
Most of these were Jews. The exo
dus was not expected to reach the
flood stage until the anti-Nazis learn
the date when Reichfuehrer Hitler
will take control of the basin.
Vienna Apprehensive
Vienna also showed nervousness
and apprehension over the prepon
derant Nazi vote, interpreting it as
presaging early renewal of Nazi
activities in Austria.
From the early morning, when re
ports about the vote began to pour
in, the dictatorial fascist govern
ment took widespread measures to
suppress any possible demonstration
in favor of Germany.
Squads of policemen were hurried
to the University of Vienna and sta
tioned throughout its buildings. The
government even refused to allow
Austrian newspapers to issue extra
editions regarding the plebiscite re
sults, Vienna took on a warlike ap
pearance.
