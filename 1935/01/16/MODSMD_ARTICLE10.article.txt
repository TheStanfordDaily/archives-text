Dean Mary Yost yesterday ex
pressed her approval of the new
system of rushing inaugurated by
Pan-Hellenic this year in a statement
to The Daily. She also thanked all
those concerned for their co-opera
tion with the administration.
She said: "I am reserving judg
ment until all the facts are in, but
at the present time it seems to me
that the new system worked better
than we could expect any. new sys
tem to do.
"Pan-Hellenic is studying the way
it worked in order to find where the
rubs are and see if they cannot be
corrected for next year.
"Members of Pan-Hellenic co
operated excellently with one an
other and with the administration.
I should like here to thank The Daily
for its helpful attitude and for the
accuracy of its statement in the extra
edition."
