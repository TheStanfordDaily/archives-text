# BALZER DIRECTS DRAMA READING
## 
### 
With a cast of veteran Stanford
actors, Sword and Sandals will pre
sent a reading of Shakespeare's
"Twelfth Night" at 7:30 o'clock to
morrow evening in the Little The
atre.
The production is being directed
by Robert Balzer, with the expert as
sistance of Dr. Margery Bailey, popu
lar English professor. During the
summer Balzer secured a copy of the
Modjeska cutting of the play â€” the
famous acti-ess' own acting script.
Play Is Popular
"Twelfth Night" has long been a
favorite with audiences. It was re
vived during the Restoration period
at the Drury Lane Theatre, and ever
since that time it has been frequently
performed. Peg Woffiington, actress,
courtezan, and stage favorite of the
18th century, carried the role of
Viola from comedy to romance, and
since that time it has been played in
that way by such stars as Ellen
Terry and Maud Adams. Jean Al
bertson reads the role tomorrow.
Another part which has offered
fertile field for scholars' study and
actors' mettle is that of the conceited
steward, Malvolio. His absolute lack
of any sense of humor and his dyed
in-the-wool puritanism make him
the butt of most of the practical
jokes played by Sir Toby Belch and
Maria. Tom Seller, who reads the
part of Malvolio, manages to catch
the spirit of the comedy which leads
almost to madness at the conclusion
of the play,
Bcnct Plays Here
The Duke Orsino, hero of the ac
tion, is a handsome young nobleman
who fancies himself in love with
Lady Olivia. She spurns him, how
ever, and his love turns to the dis
guised Viola. James Benet, Sword
and Sandals president, plays Orsino;
while the part of the Lady Olivia is
taken by a newcomer to Stanford
leadings, Adela Gantner.
Others in the excellent cast which
Sword and Sandals has assembled
for this reading include Paul Crary,
Robert Moore, Jeanette Rosenfeld,
Sidney Head, Robert Dwan, Dick
Dawson, David Hughes, and Joe
Lawry.
