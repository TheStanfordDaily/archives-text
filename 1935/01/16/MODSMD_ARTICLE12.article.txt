# Griffith Joins All-Stars For Game Against Giants
## 
### 
Their offensive power increased by
the enlistment of Homer Griffiths,
former U.S.C. quarterback, Ernie
Nevers' Knights of Columbus team
worked out on the frosh football
field yesterday afternoon.
The workout included a thorough
going-over of the Warner double
wing-back formation, which Nevers
plans to shoot at. the Now York
Giants when they meet Sunday at
Kezar. The boys also tried plenty of
passes and place-kick tries.
Nevers will put his All-Stars
through some more paces here on
the campus this afternoon, Friday,
and probably Saturday morning.
His workouts come off early in the
afternoon, and are usually all
through by 4 o'clock. Students are
invited to watch the sessions, free of
charge.
