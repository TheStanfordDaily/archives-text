# NO COMMUNISM HERE

(Editorial)
Anybody who reads Ihe metropolitan papers knows by
this time of the tremendous move that is on to "drive the
RedÂ« out of our colleges."
If it was confusing at the outset, it is even more so
today. Politicians, "leading citizens," and ministers have
joined the bandwagon in "discovering" alleged collegiate
Communistic activities.
Aside from the specific mention of two or three Eastern
institutions, and a variety of charges in the West, the in
formation deals in the main with generalities that as yet
have accomplished little more than poisoning the mind of
the layman against sending soimv off to college.
The whole mess has been pretty much trash, as far as
the fact-seeking, level-headed reader is concerned.

It is not peculiar that you and I are noI possessed with
Communistic tendencies. The very characteristic American
desire for luxuries that don't grow on trees forestalls that
possibility.
Neither is it peculiar that we resent all this rubbish that
purports to discover apparent "Ked" activities in our major
colleges and universities.
We know that Stanford is a mighty liberal place to live
if one wants to advance his own pet economic or social
theories. Nobody is muzzled, and as long as physical vio
lence is not advocated, no one will be squelched.
Yet, where there's smoke, there is also tire, we are (old.
Yes, but the fellow who calls out the lire department
to put out the smudge pot in his neighbor's orchard (before
investigation) is more than a little bit embarrassed when
lie learns of his error.
* * *
I ndoubtedly, tl\esc vicious attacks on Communism in
general originated with a serious, sincere idea. The jump
to the college world, natural as il was, has taken Ihe thing
beyond control lodav, with the distortion of facts bv
"... V *
implication.

You and I believe in freedom of speech, Ihe right lo
assemble peaceably for discussion of current problems, Ihe
privilege of the freedom of the press.
We want to know both sides of a case, in order that we
may properly formulate our own logical conclusions.
We are opposed to propaganda from the press, from
the faculty, or from fellow students- for or against any
social or political group.
We ask that these mediums be kept free to tell us of
Ihe facts behind Fascism, Socialism, C.ommunism, and the
other isms; and still we do not subscribe to Ihein.
If, after full knowledge of the facts, we then decide for
ourselves thai Americanism is not the best, then we could
never expect il to survive anyway.
Hut more than 150 years have failed lo shake thai doc
trine.
