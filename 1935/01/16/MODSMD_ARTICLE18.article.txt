# EX COMMITTEE DEBATES DAILY FEE REDUCTION
## President Kahn Silences Word Volley After Hour Session 
### 
The Daily's 75-cent subscription
fee is still with The Daily, for an- j
other week, anyway.
As A.S.S.U. President Marvie
Kahn promised Monday, no action
was taken by Ex Committee on the
controversial subject at its meeting
in the Old Union last night, but a
good deal of shots were fired on
both sides.
Kahn Ends Fight
The gong sounded at the end of
the 10 rounds with Referee Kahn re
questing (upon the request of Grad
uate Manager Alfred Masters) all
the battlers to divorce in their minds
the Daily subscription tangle from
the New Theatre.
Those who wished to take away 35
cents of The Daily's 75 cents were
Ex Committeemen Bill Rogers, Ben
Cave, and Dick Stark. For The
Daily's 15 cents were Ex Committee
man Mort D'Evelyn, Editor Stan
Beaubaire, Business Manager Bob
Herman, and Bill Ward, business
tryoutee. An interested spectator
was Graduate Manager A1 Masters.
Rogers Speaks
Epigram of the week was uttered
by Rogers: "It is not that we love
The Daily less, but the Theatre
more."
The tide of battle raged back and
forth, with The Daily suffering a
tactical reverse when Tryoutee Biil
Ward uttered Epigram No. 2: "I
think The Daily can spend the 15
cents."
Grantier Resigns
After debating almost an hour on
The Daily, the Ex Committee turned
to the subject of accepting the resig
nation of Bob Grantier from Men'.-
Council. Suggested for his successor
by Grantier was Bob Gros. Sug
gested by Chuck Glasgow was that
his resignation be accepted only
after a week had elapsed and Ex
Committee had had time to think
of successors.
Eighty dollars was granted Debate
Council by Ex Committee 1o defray
expenses for the transcontinental de
bate tour. Grantier, John McFarland,
Andrew Bright, and Fred Bold, th.">
four men picked by Debate Coach
Lee Chapin, will debate 37 colleges
on their tour.
Rogers Speaks
The registration dance, which was
originally intended for the financing
of the tour, only earned $80 for iho
cause. Many students had delayed
their return because Registration
Day fell on Thursday. The Debate
Council budget of $200 will make up
the rest of the expenses of the tour.
Ex Committee refused to rescind
their recommendation that a the
atrical architect be called in to con
sult with the University architects
on the New Theatre. Majority senti- '
ment of the Ex Committee was ex
pressed by Rogers in Epigram No. 3:
"As a recommendation, it's good."
Lec Quotes
Said Sam Lee: "I don't think Mr.
Roth thought we were foolish in
recommending this, but he may have
thought we were ignorant."
Explanation of the Stanford Ring
Mystery was made, to the apparent
satisfaction of the committee.
Nomination Changed
A technicality in Daily election
by-laws was ironed out. Editorial
Board nominations must now be
made a week before the election of
the editor.
Bob Hoover was granted a Circle
"S" award on the basis of excep- :
tional merit in playing water polo.

Voice," February 8; Cardinal A.S.
