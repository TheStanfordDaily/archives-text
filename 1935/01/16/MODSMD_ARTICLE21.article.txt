# Dr. Sperry Speaks On Liberalism
## Believes Modern Trend Toward Objectivity 
### 
Dr. William L. Sperry, dean of
the Divinity School at Harvard Uni
versity, in his talk on "The Outlook
for Liberalism," one of the Tuesday
Evening lecture series, last night
expressed the opinion that the pres
ent trend in religious throught is
toward objectivity rather than in
trospection.
"Both politically and ecclesiastic
ally," said Dr. Sperry. "the world
is veering from the left. Mild and
sweet liberalism is not only out of
fashion but is ineffectual. It is no'
longer popular in these times of
stress."
Liberalism, theologically speaking,
Dr. Sperry pointed out, can be de
fined in several ways. It can mean
freedom of individual conscience; it
can be interpreted in the same light
as liberal knowledge, as an end in
itself; or it can be defined as an ex
pression of confidence in man.
The history of l'eligion swings
back and forth between two ex
tremes, the extreme of magical re
ligion, implying control of the divine
being, and the extreme of mysticism,
implying complete absorption in the
deity. All primitive religions are ex
pressions of the first form, while the
religious zeal of the Middle Ages
exemplifies the second form.
The present era has a religion of
humanism. We are coming to tho
end of a period in which we have
substituted human happiness for the
glory of God as man's end in life.
