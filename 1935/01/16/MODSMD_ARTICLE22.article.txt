# Women Hold Arms Debate
## 
### 
Debating on the Pi Kappa Delta
question, "Resolved, That the nations
should agree to prevent the interna
tional shipment of arms and muni
tions," Stanford women debaters met
speakers from St. Mary's last even
ing in the Women's Clubhouse.
Upholding the affirmative, Stan- [
ford speakers Mary Ellen Eichel- j
berger and Virginia Slater stressed j
the fact that they were not trying to ;
solve the whole problem of peace
and war, but merely dealing with a
| small part of the subject—advocat
ing the elimination of the interna
tional salesman.
This would probably be done by an j
| all-nation treaty prohibiting the sale ';
of armaments. They affirmed that
prohibition of international traffic in j
•armaments could not bring evils
worse than those now in practice.
A return no-decision debate will j
be held next Tuesday evening on the !
St. Mary's campus. Presenting the
negative side of the same question, j
Barbara Sweet and Miriam Woolf i
will speak for Stanford.
