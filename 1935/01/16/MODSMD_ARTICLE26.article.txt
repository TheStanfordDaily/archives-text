# Student Confesses Violation Of Code To Men's Council
## Campus Leaders Feel That Act Helps To Justify Honor System 
### M Jack Newman 
As the result of a Men's Council
Honor Code instruction meeting for
freshmen Monday night, a certain
student voluntarily gave himself up
to the Men's Council representatives
as u violator of the code.
According to the student Ihe viola
tion was unobserved during the
course of a final examination last
fall quarter but he felt that he wished
a clean slate at Stanford and so con -
iessed. The student said that he took
notes to class and copied from them
in the examination.
No Suspension Results
The council considered the cast-
Monday night and yesterday after
noon and came to the conclusion that
though this student had violated the
Honor Code, he should not be sus
pended as a result of it. The penalty
imjAsed was that the student should
work off an additional number of
units to receive his diploma. Past
councils have imposed up to 20 units
in a penalty of this type. The exact
number involved in this penally
could not be learned yesterday.
Men's Council members and
campus leaders who were ques
tioned on the subject felt that this
case vindicated the Honor Code in
the eyes of the student body.
Dean George B. Culver made the
following statement last night. "I
have never had an experience of this
sort before. It shows the forceful
manner in which the members of
the council presented the obligations
of the Honor Code to the freshmen."
'In Line with Code'
A1 Page, Men's Council member,
felt: "This student's idea of honesty
and fair play is in line with the
principles of the code. I doubt if
suspension from school or any other
penalty could improve his respect
for honorable conduct in the' class
room."
Bob Church, Council member, said:
"My firm belief in the Honor Code
is reinforced by this action."
Aylctt Cotton, Council member,
gave the following opinion: "I con
sider this to be the best answer
that could be given to the critics
of the Honor Code. Under no other
systems would it be possible for
something like this to happen."
Waddy White, Council member,
said: "The gentlemanly conduct and
the honorable enlightenment, as ex
emplified in this cajse is indicative of
the increasing Stanford spirit and
typical of the ideal Stanford stu
dent."
Bob Grantier, the other member of
the council, declined to comment
because his work on this case was
his last with the council. He leaves
soon on the eastern debating tour.
