### 
Recently published by the Stan
ford University Press is Professor
Welton Joseph Crook's "Metallur
gical Spectrum Analysis." The edi
tion consists of a visual atlas of arc
spectrum lines and a book describing
the method used, and containing a
table of arc spectrum lines.
Professor Crook has devised no v
equipment which makes spectrum
analysis of metals faster and more
accurate than was heretofore pos
sible. The use of spectrum analysis
in this field is a comparatively recent
development.
