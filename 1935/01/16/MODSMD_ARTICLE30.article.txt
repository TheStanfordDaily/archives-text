There are any number of places where

reports that 40 organizations signed up for
this year's mural rat-race.
Architects have advanced a plan for re
modelling the pavilion to give more seating
capacity for games, increase its suitability for
dances and entertainments, make it safer for
the players, and provide three regulation
courts which might be simultaneously used
for intramural games. The plans involve re
placing the present seats with folding struc
tures which lit unobtrusively against the walls
when not in use.
Kncina Pavilion was the first building on
the Pacific Coast designed exclusively for bas
ketball. it was good in its day; it still has a
playing lloor that compares with the best in
the nation; but Stanford now demands some
thing better. A new pavilion would be ideal,
but the cost would amount to $250,000 or
thereabouts. The remodelling would cost at
the outside, $3(1,000, and it would remedy most
of the present objectionable features.
The B. A. C. should get busy and furnish
housing suitable for the championship Stan
ford five that will be ours in the near future.
