Cynics who point to tlu* Honor Code as a
dead and useless tiling, the noble experiment
lh;it failed, will receive a shock I'roni the news
item in today's D.mi.y about the voting under
classman who turned himself in for a viola
lion of the code.
When an intangible thing like a code of
elliics that depends upon united public opinion
for its success can have such ;i practical re
sult as this, it is far from dead and still very
much of ;i vital force in determining student
conduct.
Though no effort should he made to canon
ize this conscience-stricken youth, whose of
fense was just ;is real as any other, his case
nevertheless points a moral. It is not by hold
ing a club over the head of potential malefac
tors that the Honor ('.ode can be made to
function. No such code can be enforced by
fear of punishment alone. If il could, it would
be no different from the proctor system.
It must be inculcated in the spirit of the
student body as a living, lasting thing that one
simply docs not disobey. It is the code of :i
gentleman, not the means for checking poten
tial criminals.
