Dame Europa again breathes easier with another
of her many perplexing minority problems seemingly
solved with the Saar plebiscite out of the way.
With the return of the Saar Valley to Germany
assured, the pre-plebiscite watchwords of the Deuts
cher Front( the coalition of all parties pledged to the
return of the Saar to Germany), "Zuruck zu Deutsch
land," and "Das Saarfolk will heirn" become a reality,
as, indeed, was generally predicted.
Official results of the voting announced yester
day were: For return to Germany, 477,11!): for con
tinuation of the status quo, 40,513; and for annexa
tion to France, 2,124. Reit»ch fuehrer Adolf Hitler
said over the radio that the decision of the Saar
lander's gave him "the possibility of contributing
to the solution of Europe's problems.'!. Although
the League of Nations' governing commission still
tedinirally has control of the affairs of the terri
tory, swift actum by the League to award the
Saar to Germany formally is anticipated.
Dr. Ralph H. Lutz, professor of history and head of
the Hoover War Library, makes the following observa
tions on the Saar plebiscite:
"That Germany would win the Saar plebiscite by
an overwhelming majority, of course, is the realization
of what has long been regarded as a foregone conclu
sion. The settlement of the question no doubt fore
shadows an improvement in Franco-German relations.
"Since the National Socialist revolution in Germany,
the Saarlanders have more and more resented the
control of the International Commission of the League
of Nations, which was branded by the Hitlerites as a
living representation of the dictated Peace of Ver
sailles. Nonetheless, the reincorporation of the Saar
with Germany will bring to an end a remarkable
experiment in international administration by the
League of Nations."
The Saar has been German territory culturally and
racially for centuries. More nearly a millenium and a
half—since breaking the Roman power on the left bank
of the Rhine and in Gaul in the fifth century of the
Christian era—the Saar has been inhabited by Ger
manic peoples.
The sixteenth century expansionist policy of France
resulted (1552) in its acquisition of the three bishop
rics of Metz, Toul, and Verdun in Lorraine, and the
counts of Saarbruecken were vassals of the bishop i-f
Metz with reference to Saarbruecken castle.
Louis XIV in his military conquests annexed the
territory (1(580) on the ground that the Saar was a
fief of the bishops of Metz. In the Peace of Ryswick
(1697) Louis XIV was compelled to disgorge the terri
tory which was reunited to Germany with the excep
tion of one or two French forts (Saarlouis).
A century passed and the armies of the French
revolution soon overran the Saarbruecken. In 1801
France swallowed up the whole left bank of the Rhine,
and the Saar was in French hands until 1814. The
first peace of Paris (1814) failed to return the Saar to
Germany, but the Second Peace of Paris awarded it
to Prussia (1815).
When the Versailles Treaty came into effect, the
population of the Saar was 670.000 and by the end
of 1!)33 it had jumped to 828,000. The largest cities
are Saarbruecken and Neunkirchen. with 132,000
and 42,000 inhabitants, respectively. It is estimated
that there are about ten billion tons of coal in Saar
seams still awaiting to be mined. To the end of
1033 France had extracted about 100.000,000 tons
of coal from mines of the Saarland. Germany is
now to pay France 900.000.000 francs for mines
and other rights Fracne possesses in the territory.
"The most serious problem of the Saar will be the
regulation of its future economic relations with France,"
states Dr. Lutz. "The Saar has secured 85 per cent
of its iron ore for its industries from Lorraine. The
customs difficulty which now materializes, however,
may be solved possibly by some Franco-German eco
nomic understanding covering the two regions in
question—the Saar and Lorraine—which are essen
tially a single economic unit."
Professor Lutz concludes by remarking that the
Saar plebiscite is a triumph "of the Wilsonian doctrine
of the self-determination of peoples."

with Germany will bring to an end a remarkable

The Saar has been German territory culturally and
racially for centuries. More nearly a millenium and a
half—since breaking the Roman power on the left bank
of the Rhine and in Gaul in the fifth century of the
Christian era—the Saar has been inhabited by Ger
manic peoples.
The sixteenth century expansionist policy of France
resulted (1552) in its acquisition of the three bishop
rics of Metz, Toul, and Verdun in Lorraine, and the
counts of Saarbruecken were vassals of the bishop i-f
Metz with reference to Saarbruecken castle.
Louis XIV in his military conquests annexed the
territory (1(580) on the ground that the Saar was a
fief of the bishops of Metz. In the Peace of Ryswick
(1697) Louis XIV was compelled to disgorge the terri
tory which was reunited to Germany with the excep
tion of one or two French forts (Saarlouis).
A century passed and the armies of the French
revolution soon overran the Saarbruecken. In 1801
France swallowed up the whole left bank of the Rhine,
and the Saar was in French hands until 1814. The
first peace of Paris (1814) failed to return the Saar to
Germany, but the Second Peace of Paris awarded it
to Prussia (1815).
When the Versailles Treaty came into effect, the
population of the Saar was 670.000 and by the end
of 1!)33 it had jumped to 828,000. The largest cities
are Saarbruecken and Neunkirchen. with 132,000
and 42,000 inhabitants, respectively. It is estimated
that there are about ten billion tons of coal in Saar
seams still awaiting to be mined. To the end of
1033 France had extracted about 100.000,000 tons
of coal from mines of the Saarland. Germany is
now to pay France 900.000.000 francs for mines
and other rights Fracne possesses in the territory.
"The most serious problem of the Saar will be the
regulation of its future economic relations with France,"
states Dr. Lutz. "The Saar has secured 85 per cent
of its iron ore for its industries from Lorraine. The
customs difficulty which now materializes, however,
may be solved possibly by some Franco-German eco
nomic understanding covering the two regions in
question—the Saar and Lorraine—which are essen
tially a single economic unit."
Professor Lutz concludes by remarking that the
Saar plebiscite is a triumph "of the Wilsonian doctrine
of the self-determination of peoples."
Dame Europa again breathes easier with another
of her many perplexing minority problems seemingly
solved with the Saar plebiscite out of the way.
With the return of the Saar Valley to Germany
assured, the pre-plebiscite watchwords of the Deuts
cher Front( the coalition of all parties pledged to the
return of the Saar to Germany), "Zuruck zu Deutsch
land," and "Das Saarfolk will heirn" become a reality,
as, indeed, was generally predicted.
Official results of the voting announced yester
day were: For return to Germany, 477,11!): for con
tinuation of the status quo, 40,513; and for annexa
tion to France, 2,124. Reit»ch fuehrer Adolf Hitler
said over the radio that the decision of the Saar
lander's gave him "the possibility of contributing
to the solution of Europe's problems.'!. Although
the League of Nations' governing commission still
tedinirally has control of the affairs of the terri
tory, swift actum by the League to award the
Saar to Germany formally is anticipated.
Dr. Ralph H. Lutz, professor of history and head of
the Hoover War Library, makes the following observa
tions on the Saar plebiscite:
"That Germany would win the Saar plebiscite by
an overwhelming majority, of course, is the realization
of what has long been regarded as a foregone conclu
sion. The settlement of the question no doubt fore
shadows an improvement in Franco-German relations.
"Since the National Socialist revolution in Germany,

of 1!)33 it had jumped to 828,000. The largest cities
are Saarbruecken and Neunkirchen. with 132,000
and 42,000 inhabitants, respectively. It is estimated
that there are about ten billion tons of coal in Saar
seams still awaiting to be mined. To the end of
1033 France had extracted about 100.000,000 tons
of coal from mines of the Saarland. Germany is
now to pay France 900.000.000 francs for mines
and other rights Fracne possesses in the territory.
"The most serious problem of the Saar will be the
regulation of its future economic relations with France,"
states Dr. Lutz. "The Saar has secured 85 per cent
of its iron ore for its industries from Lorraine. The
customs difficulty which now materializes, however,
may be solved possibly by some Franco-German eco
nomic understanding covering the two regions in
question—the Saar and Lorraine—which are essen
tially a single economic unit."
Professor Lutz concludes by remarking that the
Saar plebiscite is a triumph "of the Wilsonian doctrine
of the self-determination of peoples."
