# "INS" AND THE "OUTS"
## PRESIDENTIAL FENCE-SITTING 
### CROMPTON BANGS, Jr 
BOSTON, Mass., Jan. 15.—Nearly two weeks have
passed since the President read his message to Congress.
During that time it has had plenty of chance to sink in.
What does the public seem to think of it? There being
no such thing as an "articulate public opinion," we
have to take the word of the public's spokesmen—the
newspapers and the radio.
A consensus is that Mr. Roosevelt is the cham
pion fence-sitter of all time. For instance, there
are probably 110 two individuals farther apart in
political thought than Mark Sullivan and Father
• Coughlin. Yet both praise the message—but for
very different reasons. The former considers it a
"firm move to the right" and a defeat for the forces
of Socialism. The radio priest's view is the exact
opposite. He thinks it is a "great advance toward
social justice" and a real step to the left.
But this is no more strange than that newspapers as
far apart as the New York Times and the New York
Evening Post( city's most liberal) should both find it
one of the greatest presidential messages—and for
almost the same reasons. AH this is somewhat con
fusing.
To make it worse, both Senator La Follette and
Mr. Hearst think the message is good. But the pub
lisher says it goes too far toward Communism, while
the Progressive Senator say*; it doesn't go far enough.
So what does it all mean, anyway?
The answer is probably that F.R.'s message con
tains something to plea.se everybody. If so it is a
classic political speech—the kind every politician hopes
to make some time. This is not a criticism;it is a real
compliment.
With an inexperienced and unpredictable Con
gress on his handK, with the American Legion
Bonus Wolf howling at the door, and with the
country on the road to Recovery, the President
has to sit on the fence. Under the conditions
its the only way to keep everybody happy and get
results.
After all the Roosevelt administration so far has
been mostly one of constant experimentation. Naturally
this sort, of thing can't work if the President has 1o
sink or swim with one fixed policy. It may work if
he takes advantage of the opportunity to try some
thing that looks good and throws it overboard if it
isn't.
When real co-operation is necessary for business
recovery, the Roosevelt ability, as one English corre
spondent puts it, to "move simultaneously in all direc
tion" is a valuable asset. Whether the lack of «i
"steady aim toward a fixed goal" is important we
shall see in the future. For the present, at any rate, we
won't have to worry about F.R.'s sitting on the fence;
it's his falling of! that's to be feared.
