# The 						CRITIC
## MID-SEASON AND A MUSICAL 
### 
(Note of the Review Editor:
James Sandoe, our Broadway cor
respondent, continues with It's
scries of articles on the New York
theatre season.)
The Farmer Takes a Wife is still
u warm, genial genre comedy of a
highly diverting order. Within the
Gates, soon to tour, is as splendidly
j performed and thrilling as before.
The D'Oyly Carte Company (in Phil
adelphia as this is written) continues
its merry and highly profitable
American session. <
San Francisco Locale
Of the newer shows here Gold
Eagle Guy may be mentioned as
| the first of this season's produc
i lions by the Group Theatre, last
year happy owners of Men in
Wllite. Gold Eagle Guy pre
stilts, with variations, the kind of
success-story that the film Silver
i Dollar did. But the Group actors
are raw and uneven and their vehicle
i chaotic. Martin Levy, the author,
had a wealth of rich material in his
I tale and its early San Francisco set
! ting. And he made strenuous efforts
jto use it dramatically. All that
, emerges, however, is a persistently
! troubled series of abrupt scenes
which, although they represent ex
penditures of tremendous energy by
all concerned, do not form themselves
! into a coherent drama.
Revenge with Music, "a variation
on the old Spanish folk tale by
Pedro A. de Alarcon as El Sombrero
dc TrÂ«s Picos" might have been con
| siderably improved as to taste by a
| stricter and less contemporarily col-
J loquial observance of that tale. But
; it has considerable merits in the voice
iof Libby Holman, the antics of
' Charles Winninger, Georges Metaxa.
and Rex O'Malley, and the dancing
of Rosita Ortega. It has a noisy
chorus which winds itself in and out
of dance routines with skill, and ha.s
been splendidly set by Albert John
son, some of whose designs are su
perlatively fine.
Plot Good for Musical
The lyrics and music of Howard
! Dietz and Arthur Schwartz are not
i distinguished but one or two of
them are melodious and not over
-1 reprised in the rapid arrangement of
1 scenes.
Unlike most musical plays the plot
is a sound one which descends only
i once into bathos; and the characters
i are far more substantial from the
futile satyr of a Gobernadcr to his
i fair, unwilling quarry. But one can

not but suspect that the whole would
J have been improved had the authors
been less eager to be uproariously
funny in a weakened version of the
old Keith-Albee manner.
Post Road begins slowly with a
full scene of domestic comedy which
strives to be uproarious but remains
flat as an ill-adjusted flute. There
after, however, it turns into a skil
fully managed melodrama which af
fords a moderately amusing, mild
evening of ingenious theatrics.
