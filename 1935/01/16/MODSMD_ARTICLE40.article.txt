# BULL SESSION
## THE 						SEATS OF LEARNING 
### 
When the Pilgrims landed on Ply
mouth Rock they were hard-up.
There were no hors d'oevres, no
champagne, no Simmons beds, no
cushions or overstuffed chairs, none
I of the things that make people hap
py. Thus they substituted corn meal
mush, rum, hard beds, and harder
benches. They rationalized their
hardships into nobility by declaring
that men must suffer to achieve any
\ thing worth while.
From this humble beginning has
1 grown up a tradition in America that
those things gained through the
burning fires of hardship and travail
are by far the best. If a thing
comes easy, it is immediately cast
1 under a cloud of suspicion. One of
the exudations from this cauldron of
! puritanism is the custom of equip
ping schools and libraries with
straight-backed chairs, and hard
wood benches. Presumably, if your
back is wracked with shooting pains,
j and your bottom with annoying
' twinges, you will not be lulled by the
comforts of civilization, and so will
devote yourself to study.
The Stanford Library has gone in
1 for the dogma in a big way. Most of
its chairs are the most uncomfortable
things east of the Lasuen roadbed.
True, there is the Felton Library
t which one may look at but not touch;
| and the Hopkins room which eases
i the learning pains, for a few stu
| dents. But by and large, all things
considered, as far as physical com
forts are concerned, the Library reg
isters heavily in the minus column.
We have always visualized a li
brary as a place where one could
i come and stretch, light a pipe, and
| sink into a soft, billowy armchair to
) read a book. Under such cireum-
I stances, the book—even though it be
a textbook—becomes positively en
j joyable. On a small scale, that
: dream has at last been realized.
Pi Sigma Alpha, an honorary that
believes in spending its money, has
outfitted the Victor West Memorial
Library with soft chairs and soft
1 couches. They are luxurious things,
pleasantly coloxed and nice to sit in.
One of those chairs, and the Report
of the Foreign Policy Association be
-1 comes a thing of beauty. Unfortu
nately though, this sanctum is only
I large enough to accommodate a few
Poly Sci majors; the rest ofihe cam-
I pus is on the outside looking in.

When the Pilgrims landed on Ply
mouth Rock they were hard-up.
There were no hors d'oevres, no
champagne, no Simmons beds, no
cushions or overstuffed chairs, none
I of the things that make people hap

mush, rum, hard beds, and harder
benches. They rationalized their
hardships into nobility by declaring
that men must suffer to achieve any
\ thing worth while.
