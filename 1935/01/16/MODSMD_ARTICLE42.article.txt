# INDIANS WORK ON DEFENSE AS BEAR HOOP TILT NEARS
## 
### 
Coach John Bunn's 1935 varsity
quintet gained further experience
yesterday afternoon against the
"grape-vine" offense which will be
employed by California this Friday
night when the Indians and the
Bears tangle in Berkeley in the first
of a four-game series.
Assistant Coach Chuck Glas
gow's reserves played (he Cal type
of game as they did the Trojan
style last week, with the first five
opposing. Besides the five who
started both U.S.C. games last
week, Runn had Kohin Lindsoy
trading oil' with I)inty Moore at
one guard |MÂ»st and. later, Bill
Quade working out at Rod Bosi's
forward position.
The effects of the two strenuous
U.S.C. games last week-end seemed
to have been entirely worked off as
the whole squad reported in fine
.shape. Howell Turner is still weal
ing a protector for the charley-horse
which he received a week before the
squad left for the Midwest, and
Moore's knee, which suffered a
broken blood vessel late in Decem
lx i r, is given the protection of a knee
guard.
The one new injury to show lip
yesterday occurred to Keith Top
ping, who is just getting into the
swing of the hoop game following
the close of football. Topping was
playing with a heavy bandage on
his right forearm, which didn't
seem to hinder the lanky center
despite the fact that the arm had
been severely cut by glass, neces
sitating the taking of 12 stitches.
Besides the all-important opening
game of the Cal series Friday night,
the Indians will meet St. Mary's in
the Pavilion Saturday night. St.
Mary's boasts its greatest five in
history, has twice defeated Cal, and
will give the Cards little opportunity
for a let-up.
