# DINK'S EXERCISES LIMBER TRACKMEN
## 
### 
Anyone in need of some good ex
ercise should spend an afternoon on
Dink Templeton's track team.
Promptly at 4:30 o'clock every day
over half a hundred men out ior
track are subjected to a series of
tiring exercises under the able su
pervision of the track mentor, who
directs and counts from his little
stage at Arigell Field.
Grouping themselves on the track
in IVont of Templeton, the trackmen
go through such antics as bounding
up and down, bending and touching
toes with knees unbended, the push
up, and to the tune of many "ohs
and ahs" are even forced to lie on
their backs on the wet and muddy
track while waving their legs in the
air. All this goes on to the tune of
Dink's counting, which at times can
be quite slow.
After exercises the cindermen are
free to go and, as Dink says, "have
some fun."
