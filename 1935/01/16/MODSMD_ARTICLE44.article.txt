Lee, Seward, Law, Lynch, Pom
mel-, Dey, Clark, Downey, Mason,
Lilienthal, Jonas, Taylor—thus rank
the 13 varsity tennis players at the
present.
Captain Sam Lee has held his
number one position steadfastly all
year, despite the challenges of Bill
Seward and John Law. Seward has
maintained number two position ever
since he beat Law.
Law, still far from his midseason
form of last year, has been able so
far to take Jack Lynch in closely
lought matches.
Lynch defeated Bob Pommer last
Thursday in a four-set match when
he took the last set 9-7.
There may be shifting from time
to time in the relative positions, but
it is probable the first six men on
the ladder will make up the Stanford
team throughout the season. Fairly
well matched from Lee down to Ben
Dey, any man on the team can give
liny other a fairly close battle when
at the height of his form.
