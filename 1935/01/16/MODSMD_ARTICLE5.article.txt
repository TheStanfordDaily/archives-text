FLEMINGTON, N.J., Jan. 15 (/P).
—Three German relatives and the
nurse of Isador Fisch, Bruno Haupt
mann 's dead alibi man, were hidden
as secret state witnesses tonight as
the carpenter's murder trial prose
cutors announced themselves ready
to explode ' the Fisch myth."
The mysterious manner of their
landing from the liner He de France
in New York harbor stole consider
able interest from the little old Hun
terdon county courtroom where the
slate of New Jersey seeks to send
Hauptmann to the electric chair for
the kidnap-killing of the Lindbergh
baby.
It was Fisch, says Bruno, who
went to Germany to die and left
with him a shoe box containing more
than $14,000 in ransom bills — the
bills with which the carpenter was
trapped last September.
The German witnesses are Isador's
brother, Pincus; his sister, Hannah;
Pincus' wife, Czerna, and Minna
Stegnitiz, the nurse who was with
the frail furrier when he died in
Germany last March.
With associates of the little man
an<4 others who knew him 'in this
country they will be ready to bolster
the state's contention that Fisch
was innocent.
