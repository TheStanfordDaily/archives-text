TRACKMEN MAY NOT ]
ENTER BIG MEETS

Every sports authority who has so
committed himself as to make a pre
diction concerning Pacific Coast
track, selects California to beat
Stanford in the Big Meet.
Which is what we also say, partly
because of reported Bear power,
and also because the Indians, from
early indications, will have a much
better team for bigger meets than
they do for dual affairs.
But the catch is this: i( is not
assured that Stanford will com
pete in any bigger meets, save the
Fresno Relays, which are not rep
resentative of all events.
Stanford is defending champion
for both the 1.C.4-A. and N.C.A.A.
meets, the two big affairs in those
United States for college track and
field athletes.
And it appears that Stanford
could make a very good showing
in both meets. Five men scored o5
of the .'55 1 /* Stanford points at Phil
adelphia in the 1.C.4-A. Johnny
Lyman and Gordon Dunn, two of
(he five, are through with their
competition, hut Al Blackmail,
Johnny Mottram, and Sammy
Klopstock are hack.
These three could be counted on
for a repetition of their 17 points.
Klopstock, who fell in the high hur
dles last year, would be reasonably
sure of extra points.

NEWER STARS WOULD
BE GOOD FOR POINTS

Other digits would be probable
from Chuek Nimmo, who made the
trip to Philadelphia for experience
purposes last year, in the middle dis
tances, and from Humbert Smith,
junior high jumper who has made a
decided come-up (not intended for
a pun) since last spring.
Then Ray Dean in the sprints, any
of several weight men, and possibly
a few other stars that may develop
during the season, would help to
put Stanford in a position to score
many points in a national meet.
But the Faculty Athletic Com
mittee voted last year that IJKS4

t would be the last time Stanford
was to enter the 1.C.4-A. meet,
".iust a local affair for (he East."
So the East probably wiH run off
its little tea party without the
services of the defending cham
pion, and with California and pos -
sibly U.S.C. as the chief opposi
tion from the wide open spaces.
It has been decided at various times
in the past that Stanford would not
enter any more intercollegiates; but
there was something about the tone
of last year's statement that makes
it sound as if the committee meant
it that time.

N.C.A.A. ENTRANCE
MAY BE IMPOSSIBLE

In the first place, the decision was
made and announced before the
Philadelphia meet, and it served as
an ultimatum to the eastern schools
t at that time.

So if the faculty committee ac
tually is serious. tha( will leave
only the National Collegiate A(h
k'tic Association meet for Stan
ford. The catch here is that in
mo»>t years, this meet comes <4V
during, or ju:>{ preceding, final ex
it lunations, which makes it out of
the question.
Last year it was held a week
after school was over, and it was in
Los Angeles, practically at home. IT
it is scheduled in L.A., and approxi
mately as late as it was in 1934 1
everything will be line and S'an- ,
ford's little group of stars will de- !

fend their title. But otherwise, tho
Indians' track and field activities jls
a group will be climaxed in Cali
fornia or Trojan dual meets, both of
which may prove embarrassing to
the 1934 national champions.
It will be interesting to note the ;
schedule when it is released within,
a week or so, and more particularly
it will be interesting to see when
and where the national collegiate*
are to be held. —Browne.
