The Editor, Sir:
So Mr. Norman Sears thinks that ,
any criticism of the practices that |
have been carried on under unlim- i
ited interpretation of the Syndical- j
ism law should not be tolerated by }
our reputedly enlightened commun- j
ity. In order to -do our share "in
preserving the American Standards
of Citizenship" we must not "toler- i
ate individuals who sanction such ,
primitive and un-American policies" j
as criticising one of the most obnox- :
ious and un-American procedures i
ever to be even suggested, let alone j
carried out in this country.
Does Mr. Norman Sears have any ,
idea how the Syndicalism law has
been used?
What has been objected to is its j
use solely as a weapon for the pun- j
ishment of people who could be held !
on no other grounds than their avail- j
ing themselves of their inalienable j
right to freedom of speech and the
press.
For a person to use the word un-
American in defense of such views
as Mr. Sears sets forth is nothing
short of comical. He also says "how
ever fallible (his law may be, it re
mains law . . ." From this I sup-

I pose we are to draw the logical con
clusion that as long as it remains on
I the statutes it ought not to be criti
, cized. This aLso must have been
J meant for humor.
| Using one's mind to criticize exist -
i ing evils may be adolescent as he
; says, but if it is,1 prefer to be
] adolescent than antedeluvian in my
j views..
| Final touch of humor: "some
| thoughtful and constructive â€”others
radical and detrimental." Of course,
! everyone must know that anything
radical is detrimental. All reforms
I come from conservative ideas and all
'people working for reform have al-
I ways been considered from the be
! ginning as conservatives.
