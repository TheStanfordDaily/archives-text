# HEAVY RAIN KEEPS CORPORATION YARD BUSY WITH REPAIRS
## 
### 
Recent heavy rains have been
keeping the corporation yard on its
toes lately according to Alfred Trow
bridge, assistant comptroller. One
of the most important jobs has been
the clearing of drains which have
become clogged with leaves and
refuse.
At present a scaffold has been |
erected in front of (he history build
ing for the repairing of the eaves I
troughs. Since these drains are a
constant source of trouble the cor
poration yard has the problem of
reaching them each year without
building a new scaffold each time.
Experiments have been made with
a movable support that could be
hung from the windows, but Ihis
method has proved unsatisfactory!
since it could not be used in all cases
due to the difference in building
structure. The present system deals
with each drain repairing job sepa
rately.
No new construction projects ar~
being contemplated by the yard, last
quarter's work on Santa Teresa
Street in front of Lagunita being th«?
j last job of any size undertaken.
