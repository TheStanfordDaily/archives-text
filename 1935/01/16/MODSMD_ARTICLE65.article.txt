Stanford Graduate
Dean Kirkwood received his A.B.
at Stanford in 1909, and started
teaching in 1912. In 1922 he was made
dean of the law school, and during
the year 1934 he was president of
the Association of Law Schools, a
national organization of 80 law
schools of standing in the country.

Charles V. Taylor, executive head of
the school. He is a University of
California graduate, and taught at
the University of Michigan and Chi
cago, at the Hopkins Marine Station
and Tortugas Marine Station of the
Carnegie Institute.
Reorganizes School
Last year Dr. Taylor was made
chairman of the School of Biological
Sciences, and lie has reorganized the
whole school so that a greater inte
gration of instruction has been made
possible. It is interesting to note that
an announcement from the School of
Biological Sciences at Harvard of the
reorganization came at the same time
as the reorganization at Stanfoid,
and both schools are now similarly
organized, though independent.
Both meetings will have a 30 min
ute lecture followed by 30 minutes
for discussion and questions from the
floor. Dr. C. Gilbert Wrenn, secre
tary of the Vocational Guidance
Committee, will be chairman of the
j lav/ school lecture which meets in
; the Little Theatre. In the lecture on
I the School of Biological Science,
j which meets in room 90 (Little The-
I atre corner), Dr. Karl M. Cowdery,
I associate registrar and member of
j the Vocational Guidance Committee,
I will be chairman.

Reorganizes School
Last year Dr. Taylor was made
chairman of the School of Biological
Sciences, and lie has reorganized the
whole school so that a greater inte
gration of instruction has been made
possible. It is interesting to note that
an announcement from the School of
Biological Sciences at Harvard of the
reorganization came at the same time
as the reorganization at Stanfoid,
and both schools are now similarly
organized, though independent.
Both meetings will have a 30 min
ute lecture followed by 30 minutes
for discussion and questions from the
floor. Dr. C. Gilbert Wrenn, secre
tary of the Vocational Guidance
Committee, will be chairman of the
j lav/ school lecture which meets in
; the Little Theatre. In the lecture on
I the School of Biological Science,
j which meets in room 90 (Little The-
I atre corner), Dr. Karl M. Cowdery,
