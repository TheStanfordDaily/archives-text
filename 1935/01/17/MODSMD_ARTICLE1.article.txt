# THEATER PLANS ARE SUBMITTED TO ARCHITECTS
## Seating Capacity for New Structure Considered By Committee 2 DESIGNS DISCUSSED Proposal Made for Double-Faced Stage 
### 
Actual construction of the pro
posed new theatre drew nearer yes
terday as plans centered about two
definite possibilities, submitted by
the Associated Students' New The
atre Committee to Bakewell and
Brown, official University architects.
The size of the theatre was the first
point considered. Dr. Wilbur, Comp
troller Almon E. Roth, and A.S.S.U.
President Marive Kahn pointed out
what, in their opinion, Stanford
students desired in the way of a
theatre—a theatre, but at the same
time a place in which assemblies
could be held satisfactorily.
From this point, the discussion
was directed along the lines of
whether or not an assembly hall
should he constructed with a the
atre of approximately 800 seating
capacity. Under this plan the back
part and balcony of the assembly
hall would be partitioned off.
Gridiron Practical
Acoustics were considered at great
length, and Bakewell and Brown
agreed to submit plans which would
incorporate both a small theatre and
assembly hall to replace the anti
quated structure now in use.
Continuing along these lines, the
concensus was that the traditional
gridiron, storage space above the
stage, should be eliminated, and the
latest feature of side rooms in which
to sdt up sets which would be run
in by tracks be utilized.
Elimination of the gridiron does
away with tremendous construction
cost, and also insures greater safety.
Or Double Stage
The second plan presented was to
have a double-faced stage with a
small theatre of a seating capacity of
between 550 and 800 on one side, and
an assembly hall which would seal
1500 on the other side.
The success of thi.<» plan depends
on how much money can be saved
with the elimination of the gridiron.
The architects were instructed to
present both plans and costs at an
other meeting to be held in about
two weeks.
Those present at yesterday's meet
ing were Dr. Wilbur, Roth, Kahn,
Harold Helvenston, William Murray
Timmons, Elizabeth Lee Bucking
ham, Norman Barnes, Ben Cave, A1
Phil Brown, and George
Andreini. Architects Bakewell and
Brown, and Designer Weihe of San
Francisco completed the group.
