# B.A.C. Plans Seating Changes in Pavilion
## Folding Seats To Increase Capacity by 1000; May Add Second Court 
### 
Outstanding among improvements i
: which might be made with the profit
garnered by the B.A.C. during the
past football season is the remodel
ing of the Encina Pavilion.
When the Pavilion was constructed i
in 1921, plans for seating arrange- ;
ments completely escaped the de
signer. Consequently, afier the
building had been built, seats were j
! ?ddod merely as an afterthought, i
This arrangement has proved not !
only slightly uncomfortable for the I
spectator, but also inconvenient 10 |
the students through the lack of |
space.
New Type of Seats
Tentative plans, according to bas- 1
kctball Coach John W. Bunn, indi
cate that both of these difficulties i
can be smoothed out with installa- 1
tion of a new type of bleacher called j
the Gymstand.
The Gymstand is constructed so

I that all seats may be folded back
against the wall when not in use
taking up very little room and at i
| the same time giving the appear- I
! ance of a solid wall.
Thus, when the seats are not in j
use, they may be folded back leav- j
! ing 25 or 30 feet extra floor space for j
1 whatever activity may be taking j
; place.
Courts Crosswise
With this arrangement three regu- |
lation basketball courts could be j
; constructed across the Pavilion, says |
| Bunn, providing ample room for'
j both frosh and varsity basketball
j teams to practice at the same time, j
| Heretofore, the frosh have had to j
I practice at 2 o'clock, which has ere- [
i ated conflicts both in class schsd- j
J ules and digestive systems.
. Not only would the hoopmen be
' benefited, but the students as a
j whole would have much more room
i for campus dances, concerts, etc.,
I which are considered an important j
| part of student life.
Seating capacity of the Pavilion i
is at present, including bleachers
