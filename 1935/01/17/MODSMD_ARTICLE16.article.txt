# B.A.C. Plans Seating Changes in Pavilion
## Folding Seats To Increase Capacity by 1000; May Add Second Court 
### 
Outstanding among improvements i
: which might be made with the profit
garnered by the B.A.C. during the
past football season is the remodel
ing of the Encina Pavilion.
When the Pavilion was constructed i
in 1921, plans for seating arrange- ;
ments completely escaped the de
signer. Consequently, afier the
building had been built, seats were j
! ?ddod merely as an afterthought, i
This arrangement has proved not !
only slightly uncomfortable for the I
spectator, but also inconvenient 10 |
the students through the lack of |
space.
New Type of Seats
Tentative plans, according to bas- 1
kctball Coach John W. Bunn, indi
cate that both of these difficulties i
can be smoothed out with installa- 1
tion of a new type of bleacher called j
the Gymstand.
The Gymstand is constructed so

I that all seats may be folded back
against the wall when not in use
taking up very little room and at i
| the same time giving the appear- I
! ance of a solid wall.
Thus, when the seats are not in j
use, they may be folded back leav- j
! ing 25 or 30 feet extra floor space for j
1 whatever activity may be taking j
; place.
Courts Crosswise
With this arrangement three regu- |
lation basketball courts could be j
; constructed across the Pavilion, says |
| Bunn, providing ample room for'
j both frosh and varsity basketball
j teams to practice at the same time, j
| Heretofore, the frosh have had to j
I practice at 2 o'clock, which has ere- [
i ated conflicts both in class schsd- j
J ules and digestive systems.
. Not only would the hoopmen be
' benefited, but the students as a
j whole would have much more room
i for campus dances, concerts, etc.,
I which are considered an important j
| part of student life.
Seating capacity of the Pavilion i
is at present, including bleachers
on the end, 2600, while the Gym
stand would accommodate 2700
people with no bleachers at one
end and with a 10-foot space be
tween the playing floor and the
bleachers.
All improvements necessary in
cluding six new backboards, new
' lighting features, and adequate cov
ering for the heating system could
; be made for a cost not exceeding at
i the outmost $30,000.
Pay Debts First?
Spending of the B.A.C. money is
not, however, taken so slightly by
A1 Masters, graduate manager, who
believes that present debts of the
board should be taken care of before
I additional improvements are made.
Comptroller Almon E. Roth, al
though not yet having seen the plans
expressed approval if a feasible idea
, be perfected.

: which might be made with the profit
garnered by the B.A.C. during the
past football season is the remodel
ing of the Encina Pavilion.
When the Pavilion was constructed i
in 1921, plans for seating arrange- ;
ments completely escaped the de
signer. Consequently, afier the
building had been built, seats were j
! ?ddod merely as an afterthought, i
This arrangement has proved not !
only slightly uncomfortable for the I
spectator, but also inconvenient 10 |
the students through the lack of |
space.
New Type of Seats
Tentative plans, according to bas- 1
kctball Coach John W. Bunn, indi
cate that both of these difficulties i
can be smoothed out with installa- 1
tion of a new type of bleacher called j
the Gymstand.
The Gymstand is constructed so

I that all seats may be folded back
against the wall when not in use
taking up very little room and at i
| the same time giving the appear- I
! ance of a solid wall.
Thus, when the seats are not in j
use, they may be folded back leav- j
! ing 25 or 30 feet extra floor space for j
1 whatever activity may be taking j
; place.
Courts Crosswise
With this arrangement three regu- |
lation basketball courts could be j
; constructed across the Pavilion, says |
| Bunn, providing ample room for'
j both frosh and varsity basketball
j teams to practice at the same time, j
| Heretofore, the frosh have had to j
I practice at 2 o'clock, which has ere- [
i ated conflicts both in class schsd- j
J ules and digestive systems.
. Not only would the hoopmen be
' benefited, but the students as a
j whole would have much more room
i for campus dances, concerts, etc.,
I which are considered an important j
| part of student life.
Seating capacity of the Pavilion i
is at present, including bleachers
on the end, 2600, while the Gym
stand would accommodate 2700
people with no bleachers at one
end and with a 10-foot space be
tween the playing floor and the
bleachers.
All improvements necessary in
cluding six new backboards, new
' lighting features, and adequate cov
ering for the heating system could
; be made for a cost not exceeding at
i the outmost $30,000.
Pay Debts First?
Spending of the B.A.C. money is
not, however, taken so slightly by
A1 Masters, graduate manager, who
believes that present debts of the
board should be taken care of before
I additional improvements are made.
Comptroller Almon E. Roth, al
though not yet having seen the plans
expressed approval if a feasible idea
, be perfected.
