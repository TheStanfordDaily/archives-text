# RAIN REIGNS ON CAMPUS; PUDDLES MUDDLE FROSH
## 
### BARBARA SWEET 
Nearly two weeks of rains have
boosted the season's total on the
Stanford campus to 9.44 inches. The
fortnight of downpour has also
boosted the number of mud-puddles
on the Stanford campus to an un
countable, or perhaps unaccountable,
number.
It is rumored that certain fresh
men, unfamiliar with the location of
Lagunita, mistook an embryo duck
pond opposite the B.A.C. for the lake
Other rumors say tli9t a prize is
being offered to thi< first publicity
seeking co-ed who will dare to take
a swim in the icy waters of this
30-foot puddle.
Local athletics have not been
spared. Golfers have to ford a veri
table river which (lows across the
fairway at the third hole, the base
hail team has been seen making mud
pies out of the infield, and tennis
courts are only lit for water polo-

isls. A rugby player was reported !
drowned in one of the pools that I
have formed on the rugby field, but J
fhis later proved to be untrue. The j
swimming team is doing nicely.
Women athletes, too, are having |
their difficulties. The path between
the Women's Gym and the Geology j
corner is responsible for several ;
casualties, including the loss of a j
pair of shoes sucked down in the j
ooze. Nevetheless, galoshes are de- j
cidedly not chic this year and few j
self-respecting co-eds would stoop
to draw a pair on her dainty feet.
Alfred L. Trowbridge, assistant
comptroller, who is in charge of re
pairing walks and paths on the cam
pus, stated yesterday that emergency i
work is being done on the thorough- ]
fares. Although he has no major
campaign of improvement in mind
at this time, it is believed that tlu 1 j
campus will soon be high and dry
once more.
