# Will Re-allot SERA Work
## 
### 
In order to give more students a
chance to work under SERA funds,
Mrs. Irene Spenner, employment
head, asks that all students who now
work on SERA jobs report to her if
their quota of hours for this month
will not be finished.
A large waiting list, and a great
demand of projects on departmental
work make the reapportioning of
jobs necessary, and full co-operation
is asked of the 400 students now
working. No student will get the
maximum of $20 this month to facili
tate in giving more students a chance
to work.
As no correction will be made after
checks are written, time cards must
be turned in at the cashier's office
promptly. If any student c'annot
work during February, the fact
should be reported to Mrs. Spenner.
A new release card is necessary ev
ery month, and students may get
them on the first of the month at
the Registrar's office.
