# Nevers Team To Toss Passes in K.C. Grid Tilt
## 
### 
Passes aplenty will feature the
Knights of Columbus charity game
next Sunday at Kezar, if yesterday's
workouts are any criterion.
Ernie Nevers gave his boys some
new pass plays on the frosh field yes
terday, with Ace Gutowski and Ernie
Caddell throwing them and A1 Nor
gard on the receiving end. Up at
Ewing Field the New York .Giants
also took to the air, despite the soggy
ball and tricky turf.
Nevers has been fortified with an
other strong back, Homer Griffiths,
who was more than once a thorn in
the Indian side while attending
U.S.C. Griffiths is in great shape,
having starred in a game last Sun
day with numerous completed passes
and one jaunt of SO yards to a touch
down.
Nevers will work his team out hero
again tomorrow, at noon on the frosh
field.
