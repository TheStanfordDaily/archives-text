# Dr. Townsend Errs
## 
### 
While responsible Administration leaders
:iml others who share their views about social
security try to plan a sound, sensible means
oT caring lor aged persons, well-meaning but
misguided Dr. Townsend, through California's
kindly but impractical poet laureate, Repre
sentative John Steven McGroartv, throws his
highly expensive, -$200 -a - month monkey
wrench into the works.
Congressional leaders will probably suc
ceed in stopping the good doctor's fantastic
plan but it will nevertheless have added one
more burden to those who are striving for
genuine, practical social reform.
II means that progressive leaders must not
merely light die-hard reactionaries and sup
porters of a visionary individualism, but also
(|ucll what amounts to dissension in their
own ranks.
For hard-listed Tories can point to people
like Dr. Townsend and exclaim, with wither
ing contempt, "We told you so. These re
formers are all alike, just a bunch of im
practical sentimentalists who will bankrupt
all of us."
The time has come and is long overdue for
the adoption in America of old-age pensions
and unemployment insurance, but they must
be intelligent reforms and not half-baked
panaceas. Like the poor, however, the "luna
tic fringe" in reform movements is always
with us.
At that Dr. Townsend deserves ni-ire re
spect than Huev Long and his "share the
wealth" scheme, for the former aims to help
the aged while the latter aims to help Uuev
Long.
