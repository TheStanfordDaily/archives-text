"Wiir is justifiable ;»s a method of obtain
ing redress of grievances. I'ntil a substitute
is found for lhat method war will and should
continue."
That is the opinion expressed by Sir Wil
mott Lewis, Washington correspondent for
the London Times, in ;i speech to a group of
college editors. It is typical of the arguments
of those resigned to the apparent inevitability
of war.
It is a surprising statement, not because

it is true or untrue, hut because it
reveals the fact that in this of universal
dissemination of information and opinion
there is still so much ignorance and so little
thought in the world that such statements
can pass as reasonable.
Sir Wilmott Lewis represents that enlight
ened, purportedly thoughtful class which has
thf most inlltiencc in the ordering of all'airs
in this world and in the settling of its disputes.
His group can find no practical methods of
obtaining redress of grievances other than
war, that residue of barbarism slill remaining
in the world, which demands that a nation
wronged shall obtain redress by killing and
maiming as many of its enemies as its strength
will permit, and in so doing shall suffer as
great a loss in life and property as the in
tended victim.
Men may apply thetr heritage of learning
and culture to the search for the secrets of
the universe and to inventions that will en
able them to build a show of civilization
great buildings and ships and machines; they
may strive for perfection in the arts, to know
and create beauty; they may devise profound
philosophies and religions to guide their moral
development.
But when men find themselves aggrieved
by other men they must forget their heritage
and their work, revert to the ages when rea
son-was unknown, and behave like animals
fighting over a carcass. '
That is the proposal of those who would
justify war.—Daily Kansan
