WITH MAX SAVELLE
Today the Canadian Parliament convenes for the
1935 session. Premier R. B. Bennett, an ultra-conserva
tive, plans to introduce some very progressive legisla
tion, due to political pressure and rival party programs.
"The year 1935 promises to be of extraordinary
political significance in the Dominion of Canada,'
states Dr. Max Savelle, professor of Canadian history.
"The conservatives have been in power since 1929,
and sense that there is a day of reckoning awaiting
them at the polls this spring unless they can initiate (he
reforms popularly called for.
"In announcing his intention to sponsor progressive
legislation, Premier Bennett has stolen the thunder of
his political rivals, the Liberals and Consumers Co
operative Federation, middle and left-wing groups who
demand enactment of social legislation and political
reform.
"Last summer, Harry Stevens, Conservative
minister of commerce, created a sensation by ex
posing corrupt commercial practices in Canadian
business, such as sweat shop conditions, conspir
acy to keep down wages, manipulation of prices
and irregular stock issues. Stevens was ultimately
forced to resign from the Cabinet due to pressure
from big business.
"Such conditions and general unemployment prob
lems have caused a growing sentiment for a new deal
in Canada. The laborites (C.C.F.) are agitating i'or
stricter labor laws benefiting the workman, socializing
of banking and railways, and similar reforms.
"The Liberals have already won many provincial
election victories, which alarms the Conservatives.
Liberalism has also won the adherence of business
due to the Stevens exposures. In business the Liberals
have thus far been supporters of laissez-faire. They
also oppose the Ottawa agreements of 1932, which are
reciprocal trade pacts between the various nations of
the British Empire. Bennett, on the other hand, has
favored the Ottawa agreements and championed their
renewal.
"The Conservatives seemed almost certain of
defeat, but within the past two or three weeks
Bennett has come out in favor of radical social
legislation looking to the reform of abuses which
the Royal commission of which Stevens was a
member unearthed last summer. He is now advo
cating minimum wage laws, maximum hours for
laborers, wage insurance, and betterment of agri
cultural conditions. If Bennett can put through the
program, the chances of the Conservatives in the
spring election will be greatly augmented.
"Canada is one of the nations most rapidly recov
ering from the world-wide depression, and it may be
this will help Bennett in the election this spring. This
is doubtful, however, especially in view of the Stevens
exposures, and the widespread demand for a new
deal more or less after the American fashion, combined
with the feeling that it is now too late for the Con
servatives to redeem themselves.

Today the Canadian Parliament convenes for the
1935 session. Premier R. B. Bennett, an ultra-conserva
tive, plans to introduce some very progressive legisla
tion, due to political pressure and rival party programs.
"The year 1935 promises to be of extraordinary
political significance in the Dominion of Canada,'
states Dr. Max Savelle, professor of Canadian history.
"The conservatives have been in power since 1929,
and sense that there is a day of reckoning awaiting
them at the polls this spring unless they can initiate (he
reforms popularly called for.
"In announcing his intention to sponsor progressive
legislation, Premier Bennett has stolen the thunder of
his political rivals, the Liberals and Consumers Co
operative Federation, middle and left-wing groups who
demand enactment of social legislation and political
reform.
"Last summer, Harry Stevens, Conservative
minister of commerce, created a sensation by ex
posing corrupt commercial practices in Canadian
business, such as sweat shop conditions, conspir
acy to keep down wages, manipulation of prices
and irregular stock issues. Stevens was ultimately
forced to resign from the Cabinet due to pressure
from big business.
"Such conditions and general unemployment prob
lems have caused a growing sentiment for a new deal
in Canada. The laborites (C.C.F.) are agitating i'or
stricter labor laws benefiting the workman, socializing
of banking and railways, and similar reforms.
"The Liberals have already won many provincial
election victories, which alarms the Conservatives.
Liberalism has also won the adherence of business
due to the Stevens exposures. In business the Liberals
have thus far been supporters of laissez-faire. They
also oppose the Ottawa agreements of 1932, which are
reciprocal trade pacts between the various nations of
the British Empire. Bennett, on the other hand, has
favored the Ottawa agreements and championed their
renewal.
"The Conservatives seemed almost certain of
defeat, but within the past two or three weeks
Bennett has come out in favor of radical social
legislation looking to the reform of abuses which
the Royal commission of which Stevens was a
member unearthed last summer. He is now advo
cating minimum wage laws, maximum hours for
laborers, wage insurance, and betterment of agri
cultural conditions. If Bennett can put through the
program, the chances of the Conservatives in the
spring election will be greatly augmented.
"Canada is one of the nations most rapidly recov
ering from the world-wide depression, and it may be
this will help Bennett in the election this spring. This
is doubtful, however, especially in view of the Stevens
exposures, and the widespread demand for a new
deal more or less after the American fashion, combined
with the feeling that it is now too late for the Con
servatives to redeem themselves.
