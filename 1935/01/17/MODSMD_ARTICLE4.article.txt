There seems to be a jinx hov
ering over the Theta house,
which has a desolate, woebe
gone air these days. Practically
the whole house has moved in
to either the Stanford Hospital
or the Rest Home, where a total
of 14 members have temporarily
been forced to reside since an
epidemic of colds and influ
enza struck like a plague last
week.
Vacation, hectic rushing ac
tivities, and the rainy weather
have all taken their toll, until
even the pledges have caught
the spirit of the thing. Seven
member and four pledges are
confined in the hospital, while
three members are in the Rest
Home.
To cap the climax, Ruth Wil
liams fell and was injured while
horseback riding and is keeping
her sorority sisters company in
the hospital.
