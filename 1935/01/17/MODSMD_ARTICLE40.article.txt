MID-SEASON AND MUSICAL
(Continued from yesterday)
Katharine Cornell has finally
reached Broadway with what is re
vealed as a much modified produc
tion of Romeo and Juliet. As before
the skilful and sensitive direction ol
Guthrie McClintic speeds the play
along at a breath-taking pace and
Jo Melziener's costumes are splen
did, although his stylized backdrops
are frequently grotesque.
Miss Cornell has gathered a splen
did cast of notables and her own per
formance is considerably better than
it was during the first weeks of her
transcontinental tour. She has elim
inated certain unfortunate awk
wardnesses and is less orgiastically
hysterical than before. Her portrait
of the fair Juliet is a thrilling and
frequently brilliant as well as more
satisfyingly humorous one; but it is
not yet Great.
Basil Rathbone, on the contrary, is
less satisfactory than before as Ro
meo. If he is by no means too "cold
ly intellectual" as critics occasionally
accuse him of being, his re-working
of the characterization indicates a
striving for more boyishness in the
earlier scenes which does not suit
him eminently well. In the later
scenes, however, he is a fine as ever
—and that is fine indeed.
Brian Aherne's Mercutio is bril
liant and virile and tireless as
as one of the greatest merits of the
production. Edith Evans misses the
crassness and peasant bawdy of the
Nurse but in the later scenes (usually
omitted in productions, of the play)
is excellent. Moroni Olsen's Capu
let is good; Orson Welles's Tybalt
badly costumed but sound enough;
Charles Waldron's Friar Laurence is,
as before, scarcely adequate and a
little pompous.
Miss Cornell deserves immense
credit for her courage not only in at
tempting the role of Juliet but, more
so, in defying the sad tradition that
"stars" shine better in poor com
pany. Her production is magnificent
and her cast packed with notables.
And despite the tendency of some to
belittle the direction of Guthrie
McClintic because he is usually con
cerned in more contemporary dra
matic endeavours, his direction is as
intelligent and his feeling as sensi
tive as any I have ever seen in
production of Shakespeare's plays.
The season offers other attractions
of apparently high order which 1
have yet to see: The Children's Hour,
Ode to Liberty (Sydney Howard's
latest adaptation from the French
with the witty Ina Claire), a.highly
successful musical entitled ambigu
ously Anything Goes, and so on.
But the new S. N. Behrman play,
Rain froiji Heaven, purports to be a
comedy and emerges as two and a
half hours of dull talk illuminated by
occasional flashes of high humour

1 and a thesis which is scarcely amaz
: ing or stimulating. Even such com
! petent players as Jane Cowl and
! John Halliday can give it no life and
it remains the third play of a Theatre
Guild season which has yet to offer
anything sustainedly fine.
In the near future, however, the
i Guild promises Elisabeth Bergner
j with her London success, Escape Me
I Never and perhaps John Gielgud'.s
| Ilamlet. Of Miss Bergner little need
j be said here: her Catharine the Great
j is sufficient evidence of her powers
| and superlative ability as an actress.
J Gielgud, however, is less well known
on this side of the Atlantic and may
be recognized as England's most im
j portant young actor-manager and
I lately producer of Richard of Bor
deaux in London. —Sandoe.
