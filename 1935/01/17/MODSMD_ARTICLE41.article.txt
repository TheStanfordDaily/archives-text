# BULL SESSION
## FISCAL AMBIDEXTERITY 
### 
Last spring quarter when God was
in His Heaven, and the Farm was
' bursting with greeny twiglets and
i grasses, and all was more or less
j right with the world, the student
1 body voted to assess itself one dol
| lar per person per quarter to help
j build a Stanford Theatre. Complete
j ly soused on Spring Fever, the stu
j dents did not even bother to set an
j expiration date for their contribu
j tions. The one glimmer of sobriety
| came in the expression of a general
! feeling that they were helping to
j build a theatre, not going it alone.
Came the Fall, Theatre Fever took
1 the place of Spring Fever. Certain
j people decided that the students
I should contribute s(ill more money
|to the Theatre Fund. And hungry
! eyes looked out at the "Union Dol
j lar"—that ephemeral greenback
i which Stanford men once paid as
j Union Club dues, and now just keep
!on paying. An arrangement was
j cooked up whereby the Theatre Fund
i is to get a cut on "Union profits"—
I that ephemeral sum said to exist in
; reality, but not on the books. At
| any rate, students continue to pay
| their "Union Dollar," and part of it
1 may indirectly be diverted into a
forced contribution to the Theatre
Fund.
It would seem that if the original
I justification for the "Union Dollar"
I (club dues) no longer exists, that
, Dollar should be taken off the men's
I commuity fees. If the men want to
contribute that Dollar or a part of
il to the Theatre, that is a matter for
i them—and not the Union Board of
i Governors to decide.

| Comes the Winter, and Theatre
i Fever grips the Ex Committee. They
| have now got the notion that the
1 students themselves are building the
| Theatre, and that as much of student
' money as can be nabbed should be
plumped into the Fund. They
I would like to subtract 15 cents from,
i the per capita student payment for
the Daily, and divert it to the The
atre Fund.
If the Stanford Daily does not need
the 15 cents, it should be returned to
the individual students from whenc?
it comes. If those students —as in
; dividuals—would rather spend their
money for the Theatre Fund, that is
for them to decide.
This much is certain: Even in *he
j dopy warmth of last spring, Stanford
, students did not decide that they
! would enter the building business.
They would help the Theatre along,
yes; build it, no. Stanford students
did not come to the Farm to build
buildings. And the Ex Committee or
any other body Ls not entitled to
spend any more of student money
l than the voted "Theatre Dollar'
without a special mandate from
check-writing students of the Uni
versity. —Dave Mellinkoff.
