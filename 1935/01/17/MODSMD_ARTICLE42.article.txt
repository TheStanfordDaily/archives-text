"THE PRESIDENT VANISHES"
At the Stanford Theatre
If you want to see a film which
has the courage to present a fearless
and enthralling panorama of life be
hind the scenes in Washington, you

will not miss
"The President
Vani s he s." It
concerns the ac
tivities of a jingo
group of selfish
capitalists, who
attempt toe m
broil the United

Slates in a European War.
The President (Arthur Byron) ar
ranges to have himself kidnapped,
in order to prevent Congress front
declaring war. Others in the cast
are Paul Kelly, Edward Arnold,
Janet Beecher, and Peggy Conklin.
None have the opportunity to shine
: individually, because in this piece
! ideas are more important than
j people.
