# CAMPUS OPINION

The Editor, Sir:
May 1 be permitted* to talk over
your head to the self-styled, intelli
gent and discriminating Mr. Norman
Sears?
Mr. Sears, Sir:
The inevitable consequences of un
remitting agitation lay a reputedly
< nlightened community would not be,
as you think, un-American chaos and
;,narchy, but the perfectly Ameri
can procedure of democratic legisla
tion and peaceful order as most
thoughtful and constructive intellec
tuals believe today.
Public demonstrations, though
highly emotionalized, are not adol
escent and not futile, but in fact, the
only method remaining in the hands
of an exploited class on the one
hand and the not yet shackled class
of students and professors on the
other to express themselves and form
a public opinion (which you endorse
as the best basis for democratic gov
ernment) to combat the insidious
and un-American propaganda used
to retain an undesirable law.
Without a doubt you get my mean
ing. Anyone who can write an ob
tuse letter like yours should under
stand this. For the benefit of ths
public that want less high-brow
froth, let me say this:
You are wrong. If a law is on the
books we must not forget it. If it's
good, prove it. If some primitive
liberals or radicals think it's wrong,
let them prove it. How else can that
be done than by discussion? How
can your esteemed public opinion be
formed? Who is better in leading
such discussions than an intelligent
professor or an open-minded college
student? You are like those who ad

monished the public not to criticize
the Eighteenth Amendment so long
as it was in the Constitution,
Yours very truly,
Richard W. Dickenson
The Editor, Sir:
We are surprised to find that you
have relaxed your zeal to the extent
that you overlooked griping at the
exhorbitant price of 40 cents which
students were soaked to see each ol
the recent S.C. basketball games.
How come? Weren't such games
always 25 cents per each? Certainly
it couldn't be that the football re
ceipts fell off. Why so that after a
prosperous grid season the B.A.C.
raises the basketball ante to 40 cents
to bona fide $115 per quarter payers?
Let us gripe, sir, before the right
honorable B.A.C. tries to ding us 75
cents, or some other outrageous sum
for the Cal series.
Sincerely,
Art Stoefen

The Editor, Sir:
"Step off the quad," in the Decem
ber 7, '34 issue of the Stanford Daily,
is a straightforward reminder 'to
cigarette "fiends" to observe a Stan
ford tradition. Moreover, it is an
appeal to common courtesy that non
smokers may breathe without filling
their lungs with cigarette fumes ex
haled by addicts in classrooms and
other close quarters.
Many students reveal a deplorable
lack of public regard and of training
in sanitation by throwing their nau
seating stubs about the entries of
library and academic halls. L.O.R.
