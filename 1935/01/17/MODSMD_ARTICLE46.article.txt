# THORNTON TO GIVE SWIMMERS TRIALS IN SATURDAY TEST
## 
### 
The entire swimming squad, which
has been working out during the
hist two weeks in preparation for
the annual interclass meet to be held
January 24, will be called together
Saturday for mass practice and trial
competition.
Coach Nort Thornton will climax
the day's workout with a relay race,
pitting MacKenzie, Scatena, Kuhn
and Doyle, his regulars, against a
second team in the 400-yard distance.
During the week the team members
work out individually.
Thornton declares himself par
ticularly well pleased with the show
ing of Alec MacKenzie and Martin
Scatena in recent practice. Both are
50 free-style men. This week's prac
tice has been centered around the
100 and on starts and turns.
The interclass meet will be the
first competition of the season. The
strong class of '35 which won the
meet last year is likely to repeat
again on the 24th, Thornton says.
The meet will be held on Thursday
afternoon and will be admission free.
