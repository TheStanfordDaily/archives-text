# TRIAL AWAITING NEGRO'S STORY
## To Re-tell Finding of Body In Shallow Grave 
### 
FLEMINGTON, N.J, Jan. 16 (A*).
â€”Bruno Richard Hauptmann's mur
der trial was pushed tonight toward
a grim word picture of Baby Lind
bergh's hidden grave as prosecu
tors, with the positive opinions of
eight experts, capped their accusa
tions of Bruno as the ransom wriy?r.
Thus the state, intent on sending
the glum carpenter to the electric
chair, is ready to show how Colonel
Charles A. Lindbergh's first born
son lay buried in a thicket while
Hauptmann allegedly wrote 14 lying
letters and snatched the $50,000 ran
som in a Bronx cemetery.
A negro laborer, William Allen,
stumbled across the baby's shallow
grave on May 12, 1932, more than
two months after he was stolen from
his Hopewell home a few miles away.
He will testify, and then the body,
found face down, its skull horribly
fractured, will be identified.
The state says Bruno stole the
baby from his nursery, fell from a
ladder with him and killed him in
the fall.
