# BASKETBALL TEAM IN TRIM FOR BEAR GAME TOMORROW
## Topping, Moore Disabled; Victory for Cards May Mean Championship 
### 
With one more practice remaining
before the Stanford hoop team ven
tures into the lair of the Gold* n
Bear this Friday evening, Coach John
Bunn is hard at work forming a
smooth combination that will chalk
up a victory for the Cardinals.
Everyone was out to practice last
evening and although Keith Top
ping has his left forearm in a band
age and Bryan Moore has his knee
taped, both seem capable of mixing
it up. Moore probably will be more
active than Topping as the bandage
keeps the latter from the full use
of his arm.
The majority of the practice was
spent in defensive and offensive
work with three men working the
ball in, against the efforts of two
guards, giving both forwards and
guards good practice.
Regardless of California's first
defeat by U.C.L.A., Price will put a
quintet on the floor against the
Cards that will be a good repre
sentative of the Bear type of bas
ketball which has proven too
much for the Indians the past few
years. However, Cards have prov
en their worth by defeating the
Trojans and are determined to
score a win over Cal.
A victory for the Bunn men will
put them well on the road toward a
conference title, and will likewise
spell near disaster for the Bears, who
dropped their first game. U.S.C. will
meet the Bruins in Los Angeles thio
week-end and have an outside
chance of scoring a win over Troy.
A win for the Westwood team and a
win for Stanford would put the In
dians high on the conference ladder.
