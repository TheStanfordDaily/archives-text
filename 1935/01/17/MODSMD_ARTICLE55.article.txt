# WET CONDITIONS HAMPER RUGBY PASSING WORKOUTS
## 
### 
Hpmpered all week by muddy ]
grounds, soggy balls, and lack of in- i
tensified practice, Coach Harry Ma
loney's Card ruggers nevertheless
will take on two more San Fran
cisco teams here Saturday aftei'noon,
the "B" game raising the curtain at ;
2:30 o'clock.
"B's" will play Lane Hospital, and j
the "A's" the San Francisco Blues, j
The games will count toward the
league championship ratings.
Workouts during the week have |
stressed the singular backward pass- j
ing game of the backfield line. This j
comes as a result of the sloppy show- i
ing last Saturday, which saw con- '
tinuous fumbling and bobbling about |
with scores in sight.
Passing Improves
Yesterday Coach Jim Wylie offi- !
c.ated at the whistle in a light scrim
mage. The passing teamwork showed
considerable improvement, despite
the' slippery ball.
Handling the ball on offensive
sweeps were Jim Trompas, Sam
Cockins, George Fuller, Bob Mon- |
davi, Fred Abbott, and Louis Bans- |
bach.
Men who look good on the scrum, j
and played consistently last Satur- ;
day are Captain Roger Hager, George ■
Wyman, Dick Becker, Jim Mullen, !
Jack Walton, Primo Pinotti, Marvin j
Taylor, and Frank Ingersoll.
Gridders Play
Most of the ruggers are either foot
ball or soccer players, both games
standing them in good stead in rug- j
ger, which is a combination of i
several sports. Football backfield men j
are valuable in the three-quarter j
line, and linemen are generally use
ful in shoving for the scrum. I
Saturday's games will go farther j
to determine the regular '"A" team, |
which has not been definitely picked j
as yet, due to lack of time, few!
workouts, and poor prevailing con- j

ditions. Some men, including the
veteran Frank Alustiza, are not able
to come out as yet, due to injuries.
