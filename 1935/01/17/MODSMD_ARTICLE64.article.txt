# FROSH HOOP STAR IN POOR CONDITION TO PLAY SATURDAY
## 
### 
Hank Luisetti, who scorod 41>
| points during the last four games as ;
j forward on Coach Jimmie Brad
thaw's undefeated frosh basketball [
| team, was still out of uniform at lasi '
night's practice session and may not I
i be in condition to see action when I
j the frosh meet Sacramento High!
School in the Pavilion Saturday j
J night.
; The trouble began a week ago last ,
I Friday when Luisetti turned his |
| ankle while playing against the Palo j
i Alto High School quintet. Just be- ;
1 fore last week's tussle with Lowell [
! High School he again injured the j
' ankle, and for some time Coach 1
Bradshow was dubious as to the
j possibility of his playing in the
! week-end games. At whistle time,
i however, Luisetti was ready to go j
1 and scored 25 points for ihe two!
' games despite his injury.
Now the ankle strain is healed but j
a new obstacle has appeared. While j
( returning to the gym after his wfcrk- j
i out Tuesday, Luisetti contracted the |
flu and has been ordered to stay olf!
the court for three or four days by 1
j the team physician. If Luisetti's con- j
! dition is improved by Saturday night i
jhe will start against Sacramento. |
