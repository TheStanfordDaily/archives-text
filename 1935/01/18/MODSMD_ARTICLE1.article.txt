# Students Urge BAC Profits for Handball Courts
## Ask That Gym Congestion Be Removed by Using Football Funds PRESENT SPACE SMALL Rear of Pavilion Thought Suitable Location

Among the' many improvements
suggested on which the B.A.C. migh*
.spend the profits of the past football
season are long-neglected and much
needed handball courts.
"At present the handball courts
which are available," B.A.C. officials
reported, "are situated in the Encina
gymnasium, taking up practically
two-thirds of the floor space. When
these courts are in use, usually by a
maximum of players, a great
many .students are left on the side
lines with no space in which to carry
on any other activity."
"Although space was purposely
left for the construction of courts
back of the Pavilion when it was
built, there have never been suffi
cient funds with which to carry
out the project. It was originally
intended that the group of build
ings near the Pavilion be con
nected by arches in the manner of
the Quad with handball courts and
tennis courts filling up the center.
"Since the primary purpose of the
B.A.C. at present is the paying off
of debts already contracted, the ori
ginal program could not handily be
carried out. An investigation is be
ing made, however, to determine a
plan whereby handball and squash
courts might be constructed at a
moderate cost.
"Sketchily drawn plans indicate
that three handball and three squash
courts might be built against the
back of the Pavilion at an undeter
mined but moderate cost. Though
permanent courts of the finest con
struction might prove too expensive,
good temporary courts would pro
vide much relief from the congestion
prevailing in Encina gym at present."
A.S.S.U. President Marvin Kahn
says concerning the plan: "There
is a need for solving the Encina
gymnasium congestion problem.
"The big trouble seems to be with
the four handball courts which are
now located in the gym, taking up
two-thirds of the floor spa:e. If the
concrete wall of the Pavilion couia
be utilized and courts built at a low
cost, even if temporary, a great favor
would be done for the students."
Student members of the 8.A.C.,
Stan Anderson and Frank Alustiza.
although believing that fcurrent
debts should be settled first, are
much in favor of handball courts
should a moderate cost of building be
determined.

determined.
Among the' many improvements
suggested on which the B.A.C. migh*
.spend the profits of the past football
season are long-neglected and much
needed handball courts.
"At present the handball courts
which are available," B.A.C. officials
reported, "are situated in the Encina
gymnasium, taking up practically
two-thirds of the floor space. When
these courts are in use, usually by a
maximum of players, a great
many .students are left on the side
lines with no space in which to carry
on any other activity."
"Although space was purposely
left for the construction of courts
back of the Pavilion when it was
built, there have never been suffi
cient funds with which to carry
out the project. It was originally
intended that the group of build
ings near the Pavilion be con
nected by arches in the manner of
the Quad with handball courts and
tennis courts filling up the center.
"Since the primary purpose of the
B.A.C. at present is the paying off
of debts already contracted, the ori
ginal program could not handily be
carried out. An investigation is be
ing made, however, to determine a
plan whereby handball and squash
courts might be constructed at a
moderate cost.
"Sketchily drawn plans indicate
that three handball and three squash
courts might be built against the
back of the Pavilion at an undeter
mined but moderate cost. Though
permanent courts of the finest con
struction might prove too expensive,
good temporary courts would pro
vide much relief from the congestion
prevailing in Encina gym at present."
A.S.S.U. President Marvin Kahn
says concerning the plan: "There
is a need for solving the Encina
gymnasium congestion problem.
"The big trouble seems to be with
the four handball courts which are
now located in the gym, taking up
two-thirds of the floor spa:e. If the
concrete wall of the Pavilion couia
be utilized and courts built at a low
cost, even if temporary, a great favor
would be done for the students."
Student members of the 8.A.C.,
Stan Anderson and Frank Alustiza.
although believing that fcurrent
debts should be settled first, are
much in favor of handball courts
should a moderate cost of building be
determined.
