# Health Director Urges Sensible Cold Prevention
## 
### 
Editor's Note: The following
note to the Campus Opinion
column is herewith presented
on the front page because of its
campus-wide interest.
The Editor, Sir:
While there Is no cause for
alarm, it is a quality of good
sense to avoid unnecessary ex
posure to respiratory infection,
particularly at this time of year.
Wet feet, damp clothing, bod
ily chill, and close association
with persons acutely sick with
colds are contributary causes of
respiratory disease.
This is a poor time to use
Lagunita for swimming or boat
ing. Keep dry and warm. Don't
visit your friends in the hospi
tal. They will get along better
without you, and you will get
along better without "catching"
their colds.
If you feel that you are
"catching cold" report to your
health services. That is what
these services are for.
