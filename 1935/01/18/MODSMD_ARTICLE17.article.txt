## 
### HENRY BRILL 
"Twelfth Night," Shakespeare's
amusing comedy, was read last night
in the Little Theatre by Sword and
1 Sandals. This is the popular dra
matic society's second attempt at
; Shakespeare, and from the enthu
j siastic reception given it by the usual
capacity audience it was proven that
the reading of these classics will be
come an annual event.
The large cast were all excellent
and the lines were read with un
usual understanding for a collegiate
group. Especially interesting was
[ the careful use of authentic Eliza
bethan gesture and music. Robert
1 Balzer's direction was careful and
studied, although there was, perhaps,
a too heavily emphasized tempo lag
! in certain spots, notably in the ear
lier scenes.
Paul Crary as the hearty Sir Toby
Belch: Robert Moore, portraying the
simple old Sir Andrew Aguecheek;
and Sidney Head, as the clown, fui
nished the comedy and the high-

lights of the production. And Tom
' Seller, as Malvolio, caught all the
pompous assinity of his role. Jean
ette Rosenfeld played a witty and
I mischievous Maria to complete the
comedy group.
Jean Albertson made her charac
| terization a worthy successor to a
long line of famous Violas, played in
by-gone years by such stars as
Maude Adams and Modjeska. James
Benet once again portrayed a love
sick suitor, this time as the Duke*
Orsino. He did- as well as possible
with a character inherently uninter
; esting and stereotyped.
Adela Gantner's presence in the
cast, as the fair Lady Olivia, marks
| the re-entry before Stanford audi-
J ences of a memorable name. Her
reading, smooth and poised, would
have pleased even the strict stand
j aids of her brother Vallejo.
In smaller parts were Dray to i
Bryant, Robert Dwan, Diek Dawson,
David Hughes, George Wood, and
