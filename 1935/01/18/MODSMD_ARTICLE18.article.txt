# Card, Bear Squads Evenly Matched In Hoop Tilt Tonight
## Conference Hopes at Stake For Both Schools In Berkeley Game 
### Phil Duffy 
The few remaining rooters' tick
ets for the Cai-Stanford game to
night will he on sale from !) to 12
o'clock this morning at the B.A.C.

Having the best pre-game chance j
of winning from the Golden Bears in
the past five years, Coach John Bunn
will send his quintet on the floor to
night in Edwards Gyrn against a i
California aggregation that holds the j
honor of being the first Berkeley five
that has not been the favorite to de- !
feat the Cardinal horde, in the past!
13 years of basketball relationship
between the two universities.
The game, starting at 8 o'clock, ,
will bring together two of the most
evenly matched Indian and Bears
teams. Both have won a confer- '
ence game and both have lost one.
The Cards get the benefit of the
doubt as their victory was over
the powerful Trojan five that has 1
dominated Coast basketball for the
past two years.
For 13 years hoopsters wearing the
Cardinal have been unable to win a j
basketball series from the Blue and

Gold. In fact, the sons of the Stan
ford Red have been hard put to even
win a game from the Barkeleyites.
In 1931 Stanford broke a long
drought by winning a game 37-32, in
cidentally the first victory for the
Farm in 21 starts against the Bears.
Unable To Win
Still they were unable to win the
series and dropped the remaining
two games that year, 37-34 and 46-
32. In 1932 Cal made a clean sweep,
25-19, 33-16, and 29-18. They re
peated the performance in 1933 with
three more victories, 37-22, 28-18,
and 41-23.
Last season during a series of four
games the Indians somehow man
aged to score a win 34-20 in the third
game of the series. The Price men
took the other three games, 43-34,
42-24, and 20-15. This year the hope
fuls even see a conference champion
ship for the Cardinals as well as a
clean sweep over California.
Indians May Top Heap
Coach Bunn says that the teams
tonight will be more evently matched
than any during the past five years,
and in his characteristic manner
says, "I hope we win." Bunn feels
that U.C.L.A. has a chance to defeat
the Trojan quintet tonight, and if
Stanford wins over the Bears the
Cardinal will be at the top of the
heap for the first time in many a
moon.
Bunn will start Rod Bost and
Howell Turner at forward, Kenny
Nobs at center, and A1 Page and
Bryan Moore at guards. Returning
Saturday the Bunn men will have
little rest as they face the strong
St. Mary's quintet, which has al
ready defeated the Golden Bears.

Still they were unable to win the
series and dropped the remaining
two games that year, 37-34 and 46-
32. In 1932 Cal made a clean sweep,
25-19, 33-16, and 29-18. They re
peated the performance in 1933 with
three more victories, 37-22, 28-18,
and 41-23.
Last season during a series of four
games the Indians somehow man
aged to score a win 34-20 in the third
game of the series. The Price men
took the other three games, 43-34,
42-24, and 20-15. This year the hope
fuls even see a conference champion
ship for the Cardinals as well as a
clean sweep over California.
Indians May Top Heap
Coach Bunn says that the teams
tonight will be more evently matched
than any during the past five years,
and in his characteristic manner
says, "I hope we win." Bunn feels
that U.C.L.A. has a chance to defeat
the Trojan quintet tonight, and if
Stanford wins over the Bears the
Cardinal will be at the top of the
heap for the first time in many a
moon.
Bunn will start Rod Bost and
Howell Turner at forward, Kenny
Nobs at center, and A1 Page and
Bryan Moore at guards. Returning
Saturday the Bunn men will have
little rest as they face the strong
St. Mary's quintet, which has al
ready defeated the Golden Bears.
The few remaining rooters' tick
ets for the Cai-Stanford game to
night will he on sale from !) to 12
o'clock this morning at the B.A.C.

Having the best pre-game chance j
of winning from the Golden Bears in
the past five years, Coach John Bunn
will send his quintet on the floor to
night in Edwards Gyrn against a i
California aggregation that holds the j
honor of being the first Berkeley five
that has not been the favorite to de- !
feat the Cardinal horde, in the past!
13 years of basketball relationship
between the two universities.
The game, starting at 8 o'clock, ,
will bring together two of the most
evenly matched Indian and Bears
teams. Both have won a confer- '
ence game and both have lost one.
The Cards get the benefit of the
doubt as their victory was over
the powerful Trojan five that has 1
dominated Coast basketball for the
past two years.
For 13 years hoopsters wearing the
Cardinal have been unable to win a j
basketball series from the Blue and

Gold. In fact, the sons of the Stan
ford Red have been hard put to even
win a game from the Barkeleyites.
In 1931 Stanford broke a long
drought by winning a game 37-32, in
cidentally the first victory for the
Farm in 21 starts against the Bears.
