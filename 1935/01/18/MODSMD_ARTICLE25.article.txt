# VAST SECURITY PLAN OFFERED BY ROOSEVELT
## Five-Phased Wagner-Lewis Bill To Help Aged, Unemployed PROMPT ACTION URGED Mothers, Crippled Children Included in Proposal 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 17 (/P). —
With a presidential guide before it,
Congress today set out to enact a
five-phased program to help the job
less, the aged, mothers and their chil
dren and closer to safeguard health.
In one bundle, President Rooseveit
sent to the Capitol a message out
lining what he thought was neces
sary to establish "sound means
toward a greater future economic
security of the American people,"
and a report portraying the conclu
sions reached in a half-year study by
a largo group of experts.
Bills Introduced
General opinion in the Capitol
was that the move represented the
most sweeping effort in the country'.-;
history to provide against the "haz
ards" of life.
Omnibus bills were brought for
ward by Senator Wagner of New
York and Representative Lewis of
Maryland immediately.
Tliey provided for unemploy
ment insurance borne by a 3 per
cent pay roll tax; a three-point
old age pension plan for those over
fis, at the center of whieh would
be employer - employe contribu
tions through pay roll taxes; joint
federal-state aid for mothers, de
pendent and crippled children; a
broadening of public health serv
ice with a further study of health
insurance poksibilities, and a tie
up between unemployment insur
ance and job assurance through
public works.
The government would contrib
ute more than $98,000,000 the first
year and $217,000,000 for several suc
ceeding years. Dissatisfaction with
these figures was expressed in both
official and congressional quarters,
however, and there were indications
they would be changed.
At the same time, the administra
tion laid plans for drawing up sam- ;
pie bills which will be carried before I
state legislatures by directors of the j
Emergency Council to point them i
the way to co-operate with the fed- !
eral government.
President Roosevelt asked for \
prompt action by Congress and sairl [
44 state legislatures were in session
or would meet soon. To meet this j
request, the House Ways and Means |
Committee arranged to sidetrack j
bonus bills arid take up the social j
security program. Since the meas- j
ure involves taxation, the House i
must act first.
The President asserted to Con- ;
gress the program had not attempted j
the impossible "nor has it failed to |
exercise sound caution and consid- 1
eration of all the factors concerned. - ' <
Comment on the plan and th? |
message was divided, but Senator j
Borah of Idaho issued a statement |
calling the plan "wholly inadequate."

WASHINGTON, Jan. 17 (/P). —
With a presidential guide before it,
Congress today set out to enact a
five-phased program to help the job
less, the aged, mothers and their chil
dren and closer to safeguard health.
In one bundle, President Rooseveit
sent to the Capitol a message out
lining what he thought was neces
sary to establish "sound means
toward a greater future economic
security of the American people,"
and a report portraying the conclu
sions reached in a half-year study by
a largo group of experts.
Bills Introduced
General opinion in the Capitol
was that the move represented the
most sweeping effort in the country'.-;
history to provide against the "haz
ards" of life.
Omnibus bills were brought for
ward by Senator Wagner of New
York and Representative Lewis of
Maryland immediately.
Tliey provided for unemploy
ment insurance borne by a 3 per
cent pay roll tax; a three-point
old age pension plan for those over
fis, at the center of whieh would
be employer - employe contribu
tions through pay roll taxes; joint
federal-state aid for mothers, de
pendent and crippled children; a
broadening of public health serv
ice with a further study of health
insurance poksibilities, and a tie
up between unemployment insur
ance and job assurance through
public works.
The government would contrib
ute more than $98,000,000 the first
year and $217,000,000 for several suc
ceeding years. Dissatisfaction with
these figures was expressed in both
official and congressional quarters,
however, and there were indications
they would be changed.
At the same time, the administra
tion laid plans for drawing up sam- ;
pie bills which will be carried before I
state legislatures by directors of the j
Emergency Council to point them i
the way to co-operate with the fed- !
eral government.
President Roosevelt asked for \
prompt action by Congress and sairl [
44 state legislatures were in session
or would meet soon. To meet this j
request, the House Ways and Means |
Committee arranged to sidetrack j
bonus bills arid take up the social j
security program. Since the meas- j
ure involves taxation, the House i
must act first.
The President asserted to Con- ;
gress the program had not attempted j
the impossible "nor has it failed to |
exercise sound caution and consid- 1
eration of all the factors concerned. - ' <
Comment on the plan and th? |
message was divided, but Senator j
Borah of Idaho issued a statement |
calling the plan "wholly inadequate."
