# Forty Cents Tonight For a Darn Good Game
## 
### 
Student memory must he an exceedingly
short-lived tiling if one is to judge it by the
number of gripes that are Moating around
anent the li.A.C's 40-eenl tarilT on basketball
games. Or prohahly it's like all the talk one
hears about the "good old days" that prob
ably never existed.
At any rate the complaint is based, by some
at least, on the .belief that the B.A.C. never
charged as much as 4(1 cents before. The fact
til the mailer is th;it students were admitted
for less than 40 cents only once in the past,
two years ago, when 2.~> cents was charged
for the U.S.C. games. At that time, due to a
contract that still exists with California and
t'.S.C, Stanford received only cents of the
ticket price and the practice could obviously
not be continued.
More to the point is the simple question of
reducing ticket prices, regardless of past poli
cies. The argument is raised that just as
much money could be taken in and more
students given an opportunity to see the bas
ket ha 11 games if a lower rate were charged.
The chief objection to this is that a new
contract would have to be drawn up with both
California and t'.S.C. and the latter universi
ties have so far encountered no <li(lienlly in
packing the pavilions with rabid fans. There
are several other factors—<oll'-ea in pus dates,
student dances, week-ends at home— that cut
down attendance regardless of the price
charged.
As i1 is, students get an evening of fast,
exciting entertainment for the same price as
a slioav. No one was heard griping about not
getting their money's worth at last Saturday's
game.
A championship-bound team is the princi
pal factor in drawing in the customers and
tonight will determine whether the Indians
till the bill or not.
