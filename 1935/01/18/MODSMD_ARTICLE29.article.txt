What hearing the emperor's turtle-doving
had on the course of history it is hard to
comprehend. Perhaps the scholars of the
French Mibliothcque Nationale can enlighten
us on the subject. Thev may have decided

Maybe Napoleon t*an set a new record; Cal
vin Coolidgc sold his self-approbation at $1
per word; Dickens rewrote the life of Christ
in one-syllable words and his heirs got *1.1 f>

The man who called the Knglish a nation

ought to qualify as the perfect literary agents,
who can sell a dead hero's privacy to thrill a

those cold nights at Valley Forge that will
make Napoleon look like an amateur.
