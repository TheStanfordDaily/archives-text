# Board Plans To Improve Fields, Seats
## Need $139,000 for Five Projects Proposed 
### 
A proposed expenditure of ap
proximately $139,000 is being con
sidered by the Board of Athletic
Control for improvements and addi
tions to its athletic organization.
The projects which have been un
der consideration by A1 Masters,
manager of the Board are as fol
lows:
I..lnstallation of a new system
of seating in the basketball pa
vilion to increase court space and
seating capacity. Cost 830,000.
2. Repair of the stadium fences.
Cost $10,0!>0.
3. Improvement on the Angell
Field oval. Cost $9,000.
4. Construction of eight new
handball courts. Cost $60,000.
5. Replacement of between 10,000
and 14,000 scats in the stadium.
Cost $30,000.
Some doubt was expressed by
Masters as to whether the board
would delay all improvements in an
effort to pay off the present indebt
edness of $250,000. The next meeting
of the board is to be held February
13 at which the question will be
discussed further.
Explanation of plans for new seats
in the Pavilion was given in yester
day's Daily. A new type of seat, the
Gymstand, would be installed which
could be folded against the wall
when not in use.
Work on Angell Field oval would
consist of resurfacing the strip,
stated Masters. The cost given for
the construction of the new handball
courts was based on 1929 figures and
the present cost may be considerably
lower.
Contemplated repair on the sta
dium seats calls for replacement of
seats erected in 1925. Three years
ago the board replaced 60,000 orig
inal seats in the stadium and recon
struction work on the 1925 bleachers
was scheduled for 1935.
