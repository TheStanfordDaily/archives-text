INTERNATIONAL COMMERCIAL AVIATION
Commercial aviation seems to be making real prog
ress in spite of the pathological condition of finances.
At Bordeaux this week a huge French seaplane capable
of carrying 70 passengers made a successful trial flight
over Lake Briscarosse.
The ship, probably the largest aircraft in the
world, weighs 37 tons and uses a crew of seven.
Six motors of 85ft horse power each propel the
massive machine, which is 104 feet in length,
towers 3ft feet in height, and has a wing-spread of
I(>2 feet. Trans-oceanic trips have already been
planned.
United States is not far behind the French, with
completion recently of the "Martin" flying boat built
for Pan-American Airways. In comparison with the
70-passenger capacity of the French model, the Amer
ican ship accommodates 48 for day-time Hying, and
has sleeping arrangements for a lesser number. Span
of the U.S. queen is 130 feet and the gross weight
51,000 pounds, somewhat less than that of her French
contemporary. The American craft has four 800 horse
power motors instead of six ol 850 horse power.
The French de luxe plane, with exterior of dura
luminum and stainless steel fuselage, has 12 cabins
as large as those on modern trans-Atlantic liners,
each with two beds and a private bathroom. In
addition it has accommodations for Ift first-class and
42 second-class passengers. A kitchen and bar are
part of the ship's equipment.
Since it took three years and $1,650,000 to construct
France's aeronautical prize, the United States may
prove that her plan of having a greater number of
relatively smaller planes is more practical commer
cially.
Even India, not generally considered a progres
sive country, is making enviable progress with
commercial aviation. Indian National Airways
will furnish twice-weekly passenger and mail serv
ices between Calcutta and Rangoon, a considerable
improvement on the past year's weekly trips.
London to Calcutta air traffic and service connec
tions running on through to Australia have re
cently been established on the weekly basis.
Although at present intended only as a temporary
measure during the period of occupation, daily air trips
between Heston and Saarbruecken in the Saar Basin
are being run.
