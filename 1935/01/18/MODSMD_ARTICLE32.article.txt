# LOUISIANA KINGFISH

### JOHN L. KLINE 
(Editor's Note: A recent scries of radio talks,
combined with the "machine gun dictatorship" in
Louisiana, which came into prominence last fall
bring Huey Long and his "Share the Wealth" pro
gram well into the limelight. The Daily herewith
presents a series on this unusual type of Senator,
adding to the many articles appearing in periodicals
throughout the nation.)
Conservatives of long-standing experience know
that in hard times, a "man of the people" is apt to rise
to great heights. Such a man is often a thorn in the
side of stand-pat bigwigs. In the current depression
(j.ust passing?), the man of the masses is proving to be
Louisiana's blaring loudspeaker, Huey P. Long.
Most of the country outside of Louisiana knows
Long as the man who got a crack in the j::w in :x
washroom, the man who machine-gunned New Orleans
into submission, the man who suppressed the L.S.U.
"Reveille," or the man who "pulled Louisiana out of
the mud."
More recently Long's compelling, plausible
toned voice lias come over N.B.C. often enough to
make many aware of his "Share the Wealth" pro
gram, denounced as "crack-brained," but consid
ered "darn good and right," by many of the less
pecunious.
Let's have a look at this man to see how he came
to be where he is—and just where he may be going.
Huey is only 41 years old today, young indeed for
a Senator and power-behind-the-governor of a stale.
His rapid rise would be laid by psychologists to a
deep-seated longing for revenge. When he was 24, after
a farm-boy to lawyer rise through hard work, the
Standard Oil Company refused to let an independent
company in which Huey had stock to use its pipe
lines, hoping, no doubt, to freeze it out.
Mr. Long was just smart enough to know that it
was easier to get even by pummeling down from
the top than sniping up from the bottom. The
only political post without an age limit then
vacant was that of railroad commissioner. After
announcing his redistribution of wealth ideas,
Huey undertook a house-to-house canvass such as
he would have done in his salesman days and got
himself in by the skin of his teeth.
Even a cursory knowledge of Long would lead one
to suspect the fireworks would soon start. They did.
He fought the utilities and oil companies, had the
telephone rates reduced, and was soon known as a
"friend of ihe people." Eventually, he had the satis
faction of hearing the Supreme Court decide that oil
lines were "common carriers." His original fight was
won, but Huey was now a politician and far from
through with his personal rise.
In 1924 he was snowed under by H. L. Fuqua in
the gubernatorial race. But by 1928 his rantings and
promises of actually doing what the others had only
promised won him the office. He still could see the
sinister hand of Stanacola in everything that was amiss,
and, to his own aggrandizement, soon got the people of
Louisiana to see similarly.
Huey was one "reformer" who licked the press
at the outset. lie caught up a few newspaper dis
tortions. and turned a few careless remarks to his
own ends. After publicising both by radio and a
clever urban and rural handbill and broadside
distributing system, Huey had the people eating
out of his Hnnd. Thenceforth they believed the
handbills and not the papers.
As governor, the Kingfish left plenty of tangible
results <o point tack at. He reduced the staggering
adult illiteracy by .100,000 (well over 5 per cent) by
opening night schools. He had natural gas rates cut
GO per cent in places. His free text policy increased
school enrollment 20 per cent. The 108 miles of paved
highway at his inauguration has been increased to
3,000 today. The state capitol, formerly little better
than a shanty, is now a 34-story skyscraper monument
to H. P. Long.
Nor did he put the state in the red badly in so
doing. Standard Oil suffered plenty due to corporation
and severance (natural resource consumption) taxes.
When they went to court about it, he soaked them a
nickel per barrel of oil produced for good measure.
He made such economies as installing sprinklers in
the state-owned docks to cut the fire rates. A stiff
income lax brought in more revenue.
In 1932 Huey pointed out, probably rather just
ly. that Louisiana's total taxes were a third less
per capita than the average of 21 states who com
puted city, county, and state taxes together, and
stood third from the lowest in this group—which
included California and New York, incidentally.
But all is not milk and honey in Ihe Southland nor
on Huey's own record. Tomorrow we delve further
into the Utopia of Mr. Long, where 45,000,000 will dw»'!|
around 1940—if only Louisiana can secede from tie
Union—if we are to believe all the extravagant claims
of America's No. 1 blowhard.

deep-seated longing for revenge. When he was 24, after
a farm-boy to lawyer rise through hard work, the
Standard Oil Company refused to let an independent
company in which Huey had stock to use its pipe
lines, hoping, no doubt, to freeze it out.
Mr. Long was just smart enough to know that it
was easier to get even by pummeling down from
the top than sniping up from the bottom. The
only political post without an age limit then
vacant was that of railroad commissioner. After
announcing his redistribution of wealth ideas,
Huey undertook a house-to-house canvass such as
he would have done in his salesman days and got
himself in by the skin of his teeth.
Even a cursory knowledge of Long would lead one
to suspect the fireworks would soon start. They did.
He fought the utilities and oil companies, had the
telephone rates reduced, and was soon known as a
"friend of ihe people." Eventually, he had the satis
faction of hearing the Supreme Court decide that oil
lines were "common carriers." His original fight was
won, but Huey was now a politician and far from
through with his personal rise.
In 1924 he was snowed under by H. L. Fuqua in
the gubernatorial race. But by 1928 his rantings and
promises of actually doing what the others had only
promised won him the office. He still could see the
sinister hand of Stanacola in everything that was amiss,
and, to his own aggrandizement, soon got the people of
Louisiana to see similarly.
Huey was one "reformer" who licked the press
at the outset. lie caught up a few newspaper dis
tortions. and turned a few careless remarks to his
own ends. After publicising both by radio and a
clever urban and rural handbill and broadside
distributing system, Huey had the people eating
out of his Hnnd. Thenceforth they believed the
handbills and not the papers.
As governor, the Kingfish left plenty of tangible
results <o point tack at. He reduced the staggering
adult illiteracy by .100,000 (well over 5 per cent) by
opening night schools. He had natural gas rates cut
GO per cent in places. His free text policy increased
school enrollment 20 per cent. The 108 miles of paved
highway at his inauguration has been increased to
3,000 today. The state capitol, formerly little better
than a shanty, is now a 34-story skyscraper monument
to H. P. Long.
Nor did he put the state in the red badly in so
doing. Standard Oil suffered plenty due to corporation
and severance (natural resource consumption) taxes.
When they went to court about it, he soaked them a
nickel per barrel of oil produced for good measure.
He made such economies as installing sprinklers in
the state-owned docks to cut the fire rates. A stiff
income lax brought in more revenue.
In 1932 Huey pointed out, probably rather just
ly. that Louisiana's total taxes were a third less
per capita than the average of 21 states who com
puted city, county, and state taxes together, and
stood third from the lowest in this group—which
included California and New York, incidentally.
But all is not milk and honey in Ihe Southland nor
on Huey's own record. Tomorrow we delve further
into the Utopia of Mr. Long, where 45,000,000 will dw»'!|
around 1940—if only Louisiana can secede from tie
Union—if we are to believe all the extravagant claims
of America's No. 1 blowhard.

Louisiana, which came into prominence last fall

presents a series on this unusual type of Senator,

throughout the nation.)
Conservatives of long-standing experience know
that in hard times, a "man of the people" is apt to rise
to great heights. Such a man is often a thorn in the
side of stand-pat bigwigs. In the current depression
(j.ust passing?), the man of the masses is proving to be
Louisiana's blaring loudspeaker, Huey P. Long.
Most of the country outside of Louisiana knows
Long as the man who got a crack in the j::w in :x
washroom, the man who machine-gunned New Orleans
into submission, the man who suppressed the L.S.U.
"Reveille," or the man who "pulled Louisiana out of
the mud."
More recently Long's compelling, plausible
toned voice lias come over N.B.C. often enough to
make many aware of his "Share the Wealth" pro

ered "darn good and right," by many of the less
pecunious.

tortions. and turned a few careless remarks to his
own ends. After publicising both by radio and a
clever urban and rural handbill and broadside
distributing system, Huey had the people eating
out of his Hnnd. Thenceforth they believed the
handbills and not the papers.
As governor, the Kingfish left plenty of tangible
results <o point tack at. He reduced the staggering
adult illiteracy by .100,000 (well over 5 per cent) by
opening night schools. He had natural gas rates cut
GO per cent in places. His free text policy increased
school enrollment 20 per cent. The 108 miles of paved
highway at his inauguration has been increased to
3,000 today. The state capitol, formerly little better
than a shanty, is now a 34-story skyscraper monument
to H. P. Long.
Nor did he put the state in the red badly in so
doing. Standard Oil suffered plenty due to corporation
and severance (natural resource consumption) taxes.
When they went to court about it, he soaked them a
nickel per barrel of oil produced for good measure.
He made such economies as installing sprinklers in
the state-owned docks to cut the fire rates. A stiff
income lax brought in more revenue.
In 1932 Huey pointed out, probably rather just
ly. that Louisiana's total taxes were a third less
per capita than the average of 21 states who com
puted city, county, and state taxes together, and
stood third from the lowest in this group—which
included California and New York, incidentally.
But all is not milk and honey in Ihe Southland nor
on Huey's own record. Tomorrow we delve further
into the Utopia of Mr. Long, where 45,000,000 will dw»'!|
around 1940—if only Louisiana can secede from tie
Union—if we are to believe all the extravagant claims
of America's No. 1 blowhard.
(Editor's Note: A recent scries of radio talks,
combined with the "machine gun dictatorship" in
Louisiana, which came into prominence last fall
bring Huey Long and his "Share the Wealth" pro
gram well into the limelight. The Daily herewith
presents a series on this unusual type of Senator,
adding to the many articles appearing in periodicals
throughout the nation.)
Conservatives of long-standing experience know
that in hard times, a "man of the people" is apt to rise
to great heights. Such a man is often a thorn in the
side of stand-pat bigwigs. In the current depression
(j.ust passing?), the man of the masses is proving to be
Louisiana's blaring loudspeaker, Huey P. Long.
Most of the country outside of Louisiana knows
Long as the man who got a crack in the j::w in :x
washroom, the man who machine-gunned New Orleans
into submission, the man who suppressed the L.S.U.
"Reveille," or the man who "pulled Louisiana out of
the mud."
More recently Long's compelling, plausible
toned voice lias come over N.B.C. often enough to
make many aware of his "Share the Wealth" pro
gram, denounced as "crack-brained," but consid
ered "darn good and right," by many of the less
pecunious.
Let's have a look at this man to see how he came
to be where he is—and just where he may be going.
Huey is only 41 years old today, young indeed for
a Senator and power-behind-the-governor of a stale.
His rapid rise would be laid by psychologists to a
deep-seated longing for revenge. When he was 24, after
a farm-boy to lawyer rise through hard work, the
Standard Oil Company refused to let an independent
company in which Huey had stock to use its pipe
lines, hoping, no doubt, to freeze it out.
Mr. Long was just smart enough to know that it
was easier to get even by pummeling down from
the top than sniping up from the bottom. The
only political post without an age limit then
vacant was that of railroad commissioner. After
announcing his redistribution of wealth ideas,
Huey undertook a house-to-house canvass such as
he would have done in his salesman days and got
himself in by the skin of his teeth.
Even a cursory knowledge of Long would lead one
to suspect the fireworks would soon start. They did.
He fought the utilities and oil companies, had the
telephone rates reduced, and was soon known as a
"friend of ihe people." Eventually, he had the satis
faction of hearing the Supreme Court decide that oil
lines were "common carriers." His original fight was
won, but Huey was now a politician and far from
through with his personal rise.
In 1924 he was snowed under by H. L. Fuqua in
the gubernatorial race. But by 1928 his rantings and
promises of actually doing what the others had only
promised won him the office. He still could see the
sinister hand of Stanacola in everything that was amiss,
and, to his own aggrandizement, soon got the people of
Louisiana to see similarly.
