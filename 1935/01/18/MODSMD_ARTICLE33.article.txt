# BULL SESSION
## WHEN WAR COMES 
### 
Stanford students, along with col
legians of the nation, are asked to
ballot in the "College Peace Poll"
their views on war, preparedness,
and such. To dub the thing a "peace
poll" seems like trying to premedi
tate the outcome, and to ask Stan
ford women if they will bear arms
for the fatherland sounds somewhat
silly. Still the poll should cause
students (or Roughs) to give some
thought to the question: WHERE
WILL I BE WHEN THE NEXT WAR
COMES?
One is justified in stating the ques
tion in such positive terms in as
much as world leaders are expecting
a Second World War, and if the war
does not soon materialize you will
be too happy, or too worried, to re
gret the time spent in considering
the problem.
As we see it, there are three gen
eral answers which may be made to
'"Where Will I Be When the Next
War Comes?"
1. Sitting at home behind a
desk, smoking a cigar, waving the
flag, and maybe even making prof
its.
2. In a prison, with louse and
dungeon, conscientiously object
ing.
3. Out in the mud, with louse
and bayonet, fighting.
If there is any possibility of your
honestly making Answer No. 1, you
are indeed fortunate. For when war

comes —especially when it is three
thousand miles away — there's r.o
place like home. Not only will you
enjoy life, but you will be honored.
And that is not hard to take.
If you decide on Answer No. 2, you
have a hard row to hoe. If you are
really conscientious, you had beUer
do your loudest objecting right now.
For when war comes, you will noi
have the chance to be a martyr—
much as you would like it. Behind
stone walls, with a jingo-controlled
press, one has little opportunity to
martyr. Of course, it's possible you
might be a conscientious objector
now, and get squeamish when war
comes. It is very remotely possible
that your example may do some
good.
Unfortunately, there are not
enough mahogany desks to go
around, nor enough people who will
go C.O. and stay there. Someone
will have to do the fighting. If you
decide that you are one of the suck
ers who will be doing the fighting,
you might as well join the R.O.T.C.
At least for a while, that will give
you officers' mess and a horse, and a
chance to get further behind the
lines through promotion. *
None of these answers precludes
the possibility of working for peace—
NOW. Still, war is coming. Where
will you be: mahogany desk, dun
geon, or stuck in the mud?
