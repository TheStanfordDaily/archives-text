# CAMPUS OPINION
## MORE ABOUT AMERICANISM 
### 
The Editor, Sir: |
I wish to appeal to Mr. Norman
Sears, through the agency of the
Stanford Daily, to help solve an ar
gument between myself and two
friends. We have all read his sin
gular letter, as it appeared in your
"Campus Opinion" column, but none
of us can agree as to the meaning of
the subject matter of the letter or to
the object of the writer.
One of us is of the opinion that
Mr. Sears has been reading too many
textbooks upon American govern
ment, and, which is even worse, tak
ing them too seriously. This is ob
viously the case, states my friend,
and seeks to prove his point by
quoting this typically trite phrase:
"Our government should be one
of the people and for the people and
public opinion a feature of our plan
of government."
He says that there are other ex
cerpts .that he could use to bolster
up his theory, but we asked him for
no more.
My second friend iÂ« positive lhat
Mr. Sears must be planning on be
coming a Hearst newspaperman,
and that the mental viewpoint,
having been harrowed, will now
never be rewidened. He bases his*
belief upon this bombastic and ve
hement finale:
"We should refuse "to tolerate . . .

groups of individuals who sanction ,
such . . . un-American (whatever
that may mean) policies."
My friend continues to opine that
the red flag will never lose its potent
ability to arouse bovine nature.
For myself, in most matters of a
sanguine frame of mind, I prefer to
believe that Mr. Sears was merely
attempting to be humorous by being
sarcastic.
"We should do our share in pre
serving the American standards of
citizenship."
That phrase convinced me: it
could scarcely have been intended
seriously. But should it have been,
by any chance. I do hope, for the
sake of Mr. Sears' illusions, that he
never learns better.
But we do all concur in expressing
our amazed appreciation of this typ
ical piece of political sagacity: "How
ever fallible this law may be, it
remains law; and no amount of un
restrained and demonstrative emo
tionalism is going to effect its re
form."
Such a statement implies an ignor
ance of both human nature and
propaganda: on the contrary, it is by
just such means that mass human
action can be brought about.
Now please, Mr. Norman Sears,
help settle our little argument.
