this attempt to defend our right to
discuss controversial issues I refer
specifically to the Hearst-like re
porting of the recent Walrus Club

Merriam" meeting as the first three
i fourths of the article would indicate.
: Journalism of this type won't help
| to give the "outside world" the con
i fidence which the editorial asks.
Next Thursday's Walrus Club dis

} will give The Daily an opportunity to
; show the campus that it is really in
favor of free speech to the extent of
resisting the temptation to prin'.
I something sensational.
