# HONESTY ON THE FARM
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
It grieves me greatly to cast any
disparaging remarks in regard to
the honesty of Stanford students, but
I am forced to do so. Yesterday
noon, upon leaving the library for
lunch, I placed my books in the book
racks on the first floor and left the
building. Upon returning, I found
to my consternation that my Garver
and Hansen, "Principles of Econ
omics," was missing. My other books
were not disturbed.
The person who took the book,
probably by mistake, possibly needs
it worse than I do, but, inasmuch

as I paid for the book, I feel that I
should get some use from it. There
fore, I would like to request said
person to please return the book.
