## INDIANS HAVE CHANCE TO CATCH UP ON U.C. 
### 
Stanford basketball teams have
won about as many games with
California as the Bears have won
Big Meets recently.
The general concensus is that this
year things will be different—both
ways. The Indians open basket hos
tilities with U.C. tonight and for
some reason Stanford finds herself
favored.
Should they play as they did last
week against Southern California,
plus the normal improvement .that
a week of practice this early in
the year should do for a team,
Stanford will win. And there is
very little reason why the Indians
can't make it a four-game clean
sweep in the Bear series.
Continuing with the comparison,
Stanford has won exactly as many
basketball series from California as
California has won Big Meets in
the past ten years—which is none.
