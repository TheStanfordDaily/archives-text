# NO TIP-OFF HELPS GAME FOR SPECTATORS
## 
### 
The new no-tip-off rule helps the
game for the spectators, even if it
does rtflake it a bit harder on the
participants. It is an experiment
still, but has been taken up offi
cially by the Pacific Coast Confer
ence, and was used in the Trojan
.series last week-end.
The rule provides that the team
scored on shall take the ball as on
an out-of-bounds play behind its
i,wn goal after a basket is scored,
instead of going to the center of the
court for jumping purposes. The
tip-off is still the means of settling
a held ball, and is used at the start
of each half besides being employed
after a double foul.
Main advantage of the new plan,
of course, is that it speeds up the
game—just the dish for a basket
ball spectator. It permits quick
breaking, and eliminates the ad
vantage held by an inhumanly
(all center.
Coach John Bunn seems inclined
to like the rule, although he
has not been tried out enough lor
him to definitely determine its assets.
On Stanford's barnstorming trip,
about half of the games were played
with and half without the center
jump.
