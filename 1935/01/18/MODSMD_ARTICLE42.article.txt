# KNIGHTS OF COLUMBUS GAME MAY BE WASHOUT
## 
### 
Sunday's charity football game in
San Francisco between Ernie Nevers'
Pacific Coast All-Stars and the New
York Giants, leaders of the eastern
pro league, is apt to be a washout if
rain in the Bay Region continues.
Like Alabama, both the Giants and
Nevers' team have passes, lots of
them, and much variety of them, and
rain would slow up their air game.
The sloppy field is already hurting
Nevers' chances, since his squad has
not worked itself into a unit, and all
the practice it can get is necessary to
its smooth functioning; sloppy prac
tice fields hinder these workouts.
