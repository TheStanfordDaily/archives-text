# FROSH WILL PLAY SACRAMENTO FIVE TOMORROW NIGHT
## Bradshaw's Team Hit Hard By Injuries; Luisetti Latest Cripple 
### Gordy Frost 
Playing Sacramento High School
in the Pavilion preliminary to the
Stanford-St. Mary's game at 6:30
o'clock tomorrow night, Coach Jim
mie Bradshaw's frosh quintet is out
to keep its record of no defeats for
the season.
For the past two weeks injuries
have kept Bradshaw from using
his first-string line-up, and the
state of affairs last night indicated
that tomorrow's game would prove
no exception.
Hank Luisetti, stellar forward, was
in the rest home yesterday with the
flu and Bob Zonne, first-string cen
ter, was bothered by a pulled liga
ment in his chest. First-string guard
Nelly Heath received a bad charley
horse in practice Wednesday after
noon and the same session saw sub
stitute-center Byron Forderhase
leave the floor with a fractured nose.
Heath and Zonne will he start
ing squad tomorrow but whether
Luisetti will he able to play is not
known now. At any rate the red
skin babe quintet won't be in the
best of shape to meet Sacramento
High.
Between injuries last week, Brad
shaw worked his men on offense.
Last night he gave them a short de
fensive session and instructed them
on the jump ball set-up.
Wednesday afternoon the frosh
mentor concentrated on the fast
break which employs the use of
Zonne's height under the basket.
Bradshaw explained last night that
he may be forced to direct his team
away from the fast break in order
not to tax Zonne's recently injured
ligament.
Last night Bradshaw named the
following line-up should Luisetti
he unable to play: forwards, Bill
Ilulhert and Clarence Maurer;
guards, Nelly Heath and H. B. Lee;
and center. Bob Zonne.
