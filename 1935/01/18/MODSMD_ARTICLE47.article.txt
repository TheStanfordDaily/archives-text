# Pro Elevens Plan Passes
## 
### 
Ernie Nevers, the Stanford handy
man, Sunday throws his mixed forces
against the well-knit New York
Giants unit, eastern pro topnotcliers;
at Kezar Stadium for Knights of
Columbus charity.
Both clubs are planning a quick
short-passing game," both being pro
vided with competent passers and
receivers. Homer Griffiths, the Tro
jan quarter of the past three years,
is on hand for Ernie and will share
the triple-threat game with Ace
Gutowski, an eastern fellow of some
repute.
Three ex-Stanford men are on
Nevers' contingentâ€”Bob O'Connor,
Ernie Caddell, and A1 Norgard.
