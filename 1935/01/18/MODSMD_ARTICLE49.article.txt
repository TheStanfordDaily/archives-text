# RUGGERS FROM S.F. TACKLE STANFORD HERE TOMORROW
## San Francisco Blues, Lane Hospital Play Indians At Babe's Field 
### Warren Breed 
It will be college beef and speed
against veteran experience tomorrow
afternoon, when Stanford takes on
the San Francisco Blues, and Lane
Hospital, in league rugby play here
on the frosTi field.
Card "B's" will play the first game
with the Hospital corps, the kick-off
al 2:30 o'clock. The "A's," the rec
ognized first varsity, will engage the
Blues, probably starting around 3:45
o'clock. The rugby no time-out
premise and the short half-time in
termission make the English game
faster and more continuous than the
American.
Coaches Jim Wylie and Harry
Maloney have lofty ambitions for
their team, and will accept noth
ing less than victory tomorrow.
The Lane and Blues clubs are not
among the strongest in the league,
so the coaches plan to use the
game as a trial for varsity places,
and of course, for experience.
Starting line-ups for the two In
dian fifteens are not positive, due to
earliness in the season and lack of
extensive try-out periods. These
teams, however, started the two
games last Saturday, and tomorrow's
line-ups should follow the same gen
eral trend:
"A"' team: fullback, Myers; cen
ter three-quarters, Lewis; right
wing, Reisner; left wing, Dameril;
first forward, Trompas; second
forward, Vigna; scrum half. Cock
ins; rear rank, Hager, Taylor, and
Ingersoll; second rank, Mullen and
Becker; front rank, Wyman, Boyd,
and Morrison.
"B" team: fullback, Mondavi; cen
ter three-quarters, Abbott; right
wing, Goff; left wing, Forhan; sec
ond forward, Hayes; first forward,
Cotton; scrum half, Fuller; rear
lank, Walton, Offield, and Clark; sec
ond rank, Peters and Pinotti; front
rank, Pinnell, Merritt, and Harris.
From the looks of things, these
two teams will probably be pretty
well changed around by March.
Men like Jack "Walton, Aylett Cot
ton, Primo Finotti, George, Fuller,
and Fred Abbott showed enough

last Saturday to deserve a stall at
"A" team berths.
Today's game will show the coach
es how the boys are coming along
with their scrum, passing, and kick
ing games, as well as serve as a cri
terion for future line-up changes.

afternoon, when Stanford takes on
the San Francisco Blues, and Lane
Hospital, in league rugby play here
on the frosTi field.
Card "B's" will play the first game
with the Hospital corps, the kick-off
al 2:30 o'clock. The "A's," the rec
ognized first varsity, will engage the
Blues, probably starting around 3:45
o'clock. The rugby no time-out
premise and the short half-time in
termission make the English game
faster and more continuous than the
American.
Coaches Jim Wylie and Harry
Maloney have lofty ambitions for
their team, and will accept noth
ing less than victory tomorrow.
The Lane and Blues clubs are not
among the strongest in the league,
so the coaches plan to use the
game as a trial for varsity places,
and of course, for experience.
Starting line-ups for the two In
dian fifteens are not positive, due to
earliness in the season and lack of
extensive try-out periods. These
teams, however, started the two
games last Saturday, and tomorrow's
line-ups should follow the same gen
eral trend:
"A"' team: fullback, Myers; cen
ter three-quarters, Lewis; right
wing, Reisner; left wing, Dameril;
first forward, Trompas; second
forward, Vigna; scrum half. Cock
ins; rear rank, Hager, Taylor, and
Ingersoll; second rank, Mullen and
Becker; front rank, Wyman, Boyd,
and Morrison.
"B" team: fullback, Mondavi; cen
ter three-quarters, Abbott; right
wing, Goff; left wing, Forhan; sec
ond forward, Hayes; first forward,
Cotton; scrum half, Fuller; rear
lank, Walton, Offield, and Clark; sec
ond rank, Peters and Pinotti; front
rank, Pinnell, Merritt, and Harris.
From the looks of things, these
two teams will probably be pretty
well changed around by March.
Men like Jack "Walton, Aylett Cot
ton, Primo Finotti, George, Fuller,
and Fred Abbott showed enough

last Saturday to deserve a stall at
"A" team berths.
Today's game will show the coach
es how the boys are coming along
with their scrum, passing, and kick
ing games, as well as serve as a cri
terion for future line-up changes.
It will be college beef and speed
against veteran experience tomorrow
