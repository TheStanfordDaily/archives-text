## Earle's All-Stars To Be Foes Provided Good Weather Comes 
### Dick Levi 
"Weather permitting, the baseball
' game between the varsity and Earle's
All-Stars scheduled for tomorrow af
ternoon will be played," Coach Wol
i ter said last night.
I For the past two days no practice
has been held because of the rain
and so far this quarter only four
I days have been suitable for prac-
I tice. Even then, the infield was mud
dy. Only outfield and batting prac
j tice could be held.
The line-up for Stanford for the
game tomorrow will probably be:
j catcher, Ferro; pitcher, Hcringcr,
| Campbell, Senimelroth; first base,
Mallatrat; second base, Wolley;
. third base, Clark; short-stop, Tre
maine; left field, Panero; center
field; McFadden; right field, Wal
! leen.
Earle's All-Stars probable line-up
lis: catcher, O'Connel; pitchers, Luke,
Campbell; first base, Corbett; sec
ond base, Merriott; third base, Han
nan; shoi't stop, Weber; left field.
Schimsky; center field, Jacobson;
j right field, Rosenberg.
] Co-Captain Heringer will prob
â–  ably start pitching for the Indians.
I Returning for his last year of com
| petition he is declared to be better
i than ever, and should chalk up more
than his share of wins.
That frosh team is far better
j than those of the last few years is
; the opinion of Coach Wolter.
The papoose batteries are better
than usual with Jimmy Coffis, foot
ball star, catching, and Killifer, Fur
man. Hamilton, Shingle, and Rieben
( pitching. A practice game for the
; frosh is being arranged for Tuesday
i afternoon, and will probably be
against Mountain View.
