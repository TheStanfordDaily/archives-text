## 
### 
Providing that the fence on the
northwest corner of the Angel Field
Oval becomes passable, Coach Rob
ert Lyman '"Dink" Templet on will
send the 1935 track men through the
first of the winter quarter Friday
afternoon meets this afternoon.
In this intersquad meet will be
inaugurated the new system which
Templeton has originated and wiil
use in building future ti'ack squads.
Under it a man will not become an
official member of the varsity until
he has met an arbitrary standard
which Templeton has set for each
event. Tracksters qualifying in an
event will be given red sweat suits,
with a large white numeral on the
back indicating the order in which
they qualified.
