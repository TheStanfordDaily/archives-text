# INDIANS LOSE TO CALIFORNIA; WIN OVER ST. MARYS
## Bears Outclass Cardinals 45 to 31 ; St. Mary's Downed, 41-30 U.S.C., CAL LEAD RACE Stanford, U.C.L.A. Tied For Second Place 
### 
Dropping the important conference
game and then coming back to win
an upset in a practice game, the In
dian quintet was outclassed by Cali
fornia Friday night by a 45-31 score,
but Saturday night trimmed St.
Mary's, which had twice defeated
Cal, by a 41-30 margin.
Meanwhile, the Trojans were
winning their one game from
U.C.L.A. in the south, putting Cal
and U.S.C. into a tic for the lead
and Stanford and the Bruins into
a second place deadlock, which will
doubtless be broken this week
end when the two teams meet
Friday and Saturday nights in Los
Angeles.
Against the Bears the Cardinals
were shaky from the start. Their
passing game was almost totally in
effective, though the alert guarding
of Cal's towering underbucket trio
cannot be discounted. Most of the
time the Indians lost the ball to the
U.C. hoopsters before they had a
shot at the bucket, and when they
did shoot it was obvious that they
lacked the touch which carried them
through the U.S.C. series,
California "Hot"
On the other hand, Cal was play
ing "hot" basketball, especially Jack
Kopke and Ray Olsen, the two for
wards who accounted for 27 points
between them. Cal quickly ran up
a lead in the first half and were
never headed. For the Cards Howell
Turner was outstanding, not only
claiming high point honors with 10
but with neat passes being indirectly
responsible for several other tallies.
"Hie following night Coach John
Bunn started a new line-up against
the Gaels, with Robin Lindsey open
ing at Al Page's guard post, Keith
Topping at Ken Nobb's center posi
tion, and Arne Anderson replacing
Rod . Bost at forward. Turner and
Dinty Moore held down their usual
roles.
Repeating his effective shooting
displayed in the Trojan series and
against Cal the night before, Lindsey
began ringing the hoop with long
swishers to give the Cards an early
lead which they lengthened to lead
by 19-14 at the end of the first half.
Gaels Come Back
In the second half the Gaels came
back strong, tieing the score at 23
all, but Bunn sent Page, Nobs, and
Bost into the game and the Cards
pulled away. Lindsey was high
point man for the evening with 13.
Al Nelson led the Gaels with 12.
Tomorrow night the Indians will
tackle the Olympic Club quintet in
the Civic Auditorium in San Fran
cisco. Thursday they will leave for
two games with U.C.L.A. in Los
Angeles.

"Hie following night Coach John
Bunn started a new line-up against
the Gaels, with Robin Lindsey open
ing at Al Page's guard post, Keith
Topping at Ken Nobb's center posi
tion, and Arne Anderson replacing
Rod . Bost at forward. Turner and
Dinty Moore held down their usual
roles.
Repeating his effective shooting
displayed in the Trojan series and
against Cal the night before, Lindsey
began ringing the hoop with long
swishers to give the Cards an early
lead which they lengthened to lead
by 19-14 at the end of the first half.
Gaels Come Back
In the second half the Gaels came
back strong, tieing the score at 23
all, but Bunn sent Page, Nobs, and
Bost into the game and the Cards
pulled away. Lindsey was high
point man for the evening with 13.
Al Nelson led the Gaels with 12.
Tomorrow night the Indians will
tackle the Olympic Club quintet in
the Civic Auditorium in San Fran
cisco. Thursday they will leave for
two games with U.C.L.A. in Los
Angeles.
The box scores will be found on
page 3.
Dropping the important conference
game and then coming back to win
an upset in a practice game, the In
dian quintet was outclassed by Cali
fornia Friday night by a 45-31 score,
but Saturday night trimmed St.
Mary's, which had twice defeated
Cal, by a 41-30 margin.
Meanwhile, the Trojans were
winning their one game from
U.C.L.A. in the south, putting Cal
and U.S.C. into a tic for the lead
and Stanford and the Bruins into
a second place deadlock, which will
doubtless be broken this week
end when the two teams meet
Friday and Saturday nights in Los
Angeles.
Against the Bears the Cardinals
were shaky from the start. Their
passing game was almost totally in
effective, though the alert guarding
of Cal's towering underbucket trio
cannot be discounted. Most of the
time the Indians lost the ball to the
U.C. hoopsters before they had a
shot at the bucket, and when they
did shoot it was obvious that they
lacked the touch which carried them
through the U.S.C. series,
California "Hot"
On the other hand, Cal was play
ing "hot" basketball, especially Jack
Kopke and Ray Olsen, the two for
wards who accounted for 27 points
between them. Cal quickly ran up
a lead in the first half and were
never headed. For the Cards Howell
Turner was outstanding, not only
claiming high point honors with 10
but with neat passes being indirectly
responsible for several other tallies.
