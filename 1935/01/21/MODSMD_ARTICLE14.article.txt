# Old Time College Pranks Include Riots, Bombings, Arson, Homicide

Hoses may play freely during dark [
Enema nights, hay-stacks may blaze j
in the library's back yard, and new- J
fledged row initiates may toss naked
seniors into the women's pool, but :
such antics are even less than child's
play compared with old time Amer
ican collegiate capers.
The present day milk-toast brand I
of campus mischief is water-weak
when laid along-side of the inno- i
cent pranks of three and four gen- ;
erations ago. History testifies to the j
fact.
Dr. Andrew I). White, president
of Cornell University, when an
undergraduate at Hohart, wrote:
"I have seen one professor driven
out of a room with books and
spittoons thrown at his head, and
have also seen snowballs and bot
tles hurled at the highly respected
college president."
In the 1840's a Bowdoin student
threw .sulphuric acid on the face of
his prof and was expelled. But he
felt the punishment for his burst of
high spirits so keenly that the col
lege restored him to good standing!
Student Shot
Early American college professors
had to consider bodily attacks merely

| as a trade risk of their profession. I
One distinguished teacher at the
University «of Virginia actually shot !
a student in his class room, claiming
self-defense.
Arson was just ordinary horse
play to old-time scholars. At Yale, j
j burning of the huge coal yard was m [
I annual tradition. And in 1839 at j
Bowdoin President Allen's house |
was deliberately burned to the i
: ground.
Fire Cannon
Back in 1823 some mischievous
students at Hamilton College pulled
a really prize trick, They dragged a i
| cannon to the top floor of a dormi- !
tory and aimed it at the door of a j
college tutor. The discharge missed
the tutor but it blew his clothes, i
which were lying on a chair, through I
the side of the building. '
Bombs were also favorite instru
ments of rollicking fun in the early
days, and in 1838 some Harvard
scapegraces attempted to blow the
roof ofT the library. They failed, but !
to keep the evening from being a |
failure they blew all the glass out of j
the chapel windows and broke up the
clock and the pulpit.
j Vale undergraduates in the 1850's I

i were real lads <»f spirit. In a par
ticular heated battle between town
and gown two or three townics
j were wounded by pistol shuts and
one was killed with a dirk. No
one was arrested, although the
name of the murderer is still
whispered under campus elms.
When firemen turned their hoses
i on students al Yale for singing their
| college songs one time, the students
attacked. One over-zealous invader
drew his ever-ready pistol and shot
the firemen's general. The chief died
the next day, but, according to his
i tory, no one was incriminated bo
! cause "the general college senti
ment rather deprecated the shooting
j as needless."
New Order Today
But those halcyon days have van
ished. A new order reigneth. And
modern professors, instead of facing
| brickbats and pistols in classooms,
I have only boredom, ennui, and sleep
I with which to contend. As a his-
I torian states, "Let them look back
! on the brave world gone by, when
I college life was careless and bold,
and the golden hours were filled with
i mischief, assault and battery, arson
land homicide."
