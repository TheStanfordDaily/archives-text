### 
ATLANTIC CITY, N.J., Jan. 20
(/P). —Alvin Karpis, America's public
enemy No. 1, blazed his way with
spitting machine gun fire early to
day out of a police trap laid for him
around a small hotel.
With Harry Campbell, another
hunted midwestem gangster, lie
shouted defiance to the police com
mand to surrender, flung rounds of
bullets in the direction of the po
lice, stole a motor car, made a des
perate effort to rescue two women
companions from police custody
and then, with guns still roaring
above the exhaust of their ma
chine, sped away.
One policeman narrowly escaped
death when a bullet pierced his cap.
Dolores Delaney, described as
"Karpis' girl," was wounded in the
leg. The other woman was arrested.
She was identified as Louise Camp
bell, wife of Campbell, and within
a few days of becoming a mother,
police said.
The woman police said was Mrs.
Campbell aLso was identified as
Winona Burdette of Tulsa, Okla.
Both are in their early twenties and
attractive.
Tip from Florida
The tip that led to the unsuccess
ful attempt to arrest Karpis, who
is wanted for the Edward Bremer
kidnaping in St. Paul, Minn., a year
ago—a kidnaping in which a $200,-
000 ransom was paid — came from
Florida police.
The Atlantic City police investi
gation led them to a garage near
the Boardwalk, and it was there the
car was found. In it was a rifle
and some ammunition. The Florida
information had warned that the
men were heavily armed and well
supplied with ammunition.
From the garage, the trail led to
the hotel operated by Dan Young
and William Morley.
Detectives Mulhern and Brennan
found Karpis and Campbell had reg
istered Friday.
It was about 5 a.m. when the de
tectives reached the hotel. Plac
ing police around the place, the
officers went to the room occupied
by the two men, and pounded on
the door. Mulhern yelled:
"Open the door and stick 'em
up. We're officers."
Karpis barked back:
"Stick 'em up yourself, coppers!"
The two desperadoes opened
fire with machine guns, bullets
tearing through the door.
The officers hid around a bend of
the corridor and returned the fire.
Men Race Out
Immediately the door of Karpi.s'
room burst open and the two men
raced out, their guns pumping lead
in the direction from which shots
of the detectives' guns were coming.
Karpis and Campbell charged
through the fusillade, leaped into
a car parked nearby and sped away.
The elaborate tri-state police sys
tem was swung into the pursuit.
State troopers throughout New Jer
sey, New York, and Pennsylvania
are on the alert prepared for armed
resistance.
