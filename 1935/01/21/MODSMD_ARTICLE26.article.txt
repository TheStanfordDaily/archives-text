# Huey Longâ€” Southern Spellbinder
## 
### 
The Daily calls the reader's particular at
tention to its current series of informative
articles on the grand phenomenon of the south,
Senator Huev "Kinglish" Long. Despite the
burden of a multitude of sins indicted on him
by the press of this nation, the Louisiana boss
stands as a vital and important figure.
tic casts a long and ominous political shad
ow across our favored country; obviously, he
lias designs of prizes bigger than those to be
claimed in his own state. Once his activities
were confined to the southland; now he is
seeping out in long, slender lines from the
Atlantic to the Pacific.
The way has well been prepared by the very
newspapers that jeered him; his name bears*
both a promise and a threat. To the millions
who listened to his seductive utterances over
the radio, broadcast to the nation twice within
the last few days, he appeared more like a
prophet calling them to the promised land,
than like a demagogue, properly the laughing
slock of everyone.
Huey's words are challenging to the wealthy,
inspiring to the poor, soothing to those who
have been reading that he is a madman. That
he is looking forward, in the not too distant
future, towards claims on the presidency, is
not impossible. He can lure the miserable,
the (liiwii and outers, the forgotten men; he
can be the Messiah to America that Sinclair
was to (Tali'ornia.
And he is far more astute than the Pasa
dena mahatma, in that he has refused to ally
himself with any ism, thus retaining all the
strength of dictatorial government without
the social stigma of Socialism, Communism,
Fascism.
Keep a weather eye upon him, friends. The
man from the south bears watching.
