# Social Security Ahead?
## 
### 
President Roosevelt lias submitted a com
prehensive' social security program to Con
gress, a reform long overdue in America. II
will cost money, as does practically all ol the
New Deal, hut economic security does not fall
as the gentle rain from heaven. It must he
bought and paid for.
At that, the cost of the President's five-point
program is hut a drop in the bucket as com
pared to the Townsend Plan and other fan
tastic panaceas. In fact, the proposed legisla
tion is far from being a headlong dash into
(iovernment paternalism. It is a cautious, very
moderate venture as indicated by the Presi
dent's own message to Congress in which he
disclaims any attempt to do the impossible and
says of the program "nor has il failed to exer
cise sound caution and consideration of all the
factors concerned."
In fact it is such a mild reform that Senator
Borah was led to brand it as "wholly inade
quate." As a long range policy it doubtless is.
An old age pension of *.'W a month is not cal
culated to enable a person to live in sumptuous
luxury, lint the plan is a start in the right
direction, a move toward a goal which so
called backward European nations are far
ahead of us in attaining.
Though pension plans may impinge some
what on the American philosophy of individ
ualism, it must be remembered that that phil
osophy means absolutely nothing to the vast
majority of our population. To them it means
only the right to he exploited by someone else
and to starve to death when old age or unem
ployment is their lot.
For those who can survive, American indi
vidualism is still a living, significant thing;
for those who fall by the wayside in the hitter
there is, at least, a chance to keep
alive.
