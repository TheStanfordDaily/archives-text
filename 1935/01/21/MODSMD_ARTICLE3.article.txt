# Series on True Reich Conditions Start Friday
## 
### 
The "inside story" of Ger
many.
While press censorship and
personal surveillance of all
known correspondents in the
Reich keeps news of social
change there well supervised,
The Daily presents a novel se
ries of observations, beginning
Friday, which are unccnsored
and unbiased.
The Stanford Daily observer,
a former Stanford man study
ing in a German province, must
for obvious reasons he anony
mous. Even personal corre
spondence is watched in Ger
many, and some of his letters
have not arrived. Others, some
sent from foreign countries to
forestall German censors, have
been edited and will form the
series.
Statements about the Ger
man attitude toward this or that
policy of the Nazis are not from
the mouths of professors or of
ficials; they come from the
working men and peasants.
Read this series of analytical
observations and you will un
derstand Germany better; it
starts Fridav.
