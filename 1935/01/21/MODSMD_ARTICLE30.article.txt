# LOUISIANA KINGFISH
## 
### JOHN L. KLINE 
(Editor's Note—The Daily presents the second
of a series on "man of the people" Huey I'. Long,
ranting Senator, who was heard 011 NBC Saturday, "
when he said. "There's only one way to save
America—that is to pull wealth down from the
top and distribute it to those at the bottom, God
told us just exactly how to do it all.")
When Long left the governorship to represent Loui
siana in the Senate, he was securely entrenched within
his own state. A multitude of henchmen on the pay
rolls and control of all assessing in the state were his
bulwarks. Long's pals found the assessed valuation of
their property surprisingly low, but antis found re
markable soaring in assessed*worth of their holdings.
Huey left behind a dummy governor, O. K. Allen,
and a smooth running slate machine. Even so, many
nought n.s influence was waning and at the opening
of 1934 believed he was on the downgrade. They were
mistaken. Long's banner year was 1934. His once
fantastic ambition to occupy the White House seems
less of a jo*ke daily.
The year opened with T. Semnies Walmsley and
cohorts heating the Long adherents soundly in
New Orleans elections. But Huey's puppet legis
lature fixed that. In a rapid summer session it
passed laws that to all intents pardoned crooks
retroactively and in advance. Simultaneously, cor
poration taxes were boosted, and punitive taxes
put on utilities and newspapers.
Huey was in the saddle for the elections. With
special deputies, $5 per day officers, and the militia at
his command, with judicial power radically curbed,
Huey moved into New Orleans, loudly proclaiming that
he was fighting vice of all breeds and the Tammany
like Walmsley crowd.
Unfortunately for the latter, their skirts were in
reality rather dirty. New Orleans knew it, and for
getting about the many state vices of the Long machine,
snowed Walmsley under by a phenomenal margin. In
order not to antagonize the vice vote, which was con
siderable, Long's ward-heelers had promised enough
protection to counteract his clamorous denouncements
from radio and platform of gambling, prostitution,
and all.
In November of last year, Huey P. blazed anew in
the front pages. Reason: the 44 bills, and the suppres
sion of "Reveille."
The oft-cited batch of bills was rubber-stamped
by a public assembly in an open manner never
before approached in this country for sheer brazen
ness. Huey was in the legislative chambers per
sonally to see that there were no slip-ups. To the
committees, he explained the gist of the bills. To
the assembly, he explained he'd read them, that
they were okay, and hence that further reading
would be superfluous. Only a handful were read
farther than the title before being passed.
One bill repealed the Corrupt Practices Act, so
that Huey's candidates would not have to be bothered
by details such as accounting for the source of their
campaign contributions. Now, job-holders pay from
10 to 20 per cent of their salaries into slush funds.
Judges who oppose moratorium laws find themselves
without benches, after Huey places these funds behind
his judicial candidates. Many a boss throughout the
land watches enviously as Huey places both ends
against the middle.
Others put the local fire and police chiefs under the
Long thumb. Huey admitted he was out to "get" those
obnoxious to him—such as the Alexandria police chief
who let a mob rotten-egg him last year. The bar asso
ciation practically lost all control over lawyers.
Another was destined to "take the kinks out of the
old income tax law." The one anti-Long man in the
legislature asked Huey if he meant the "old income
tax law of 1934?" The "dictator's" reply: "Yes, we're
moving so fast now I expect babies to be talking at
six months." Logical? Maybe not, but who needs
logic when he has stooges so afraid not to laugh at
His Mightiness' gags that their gales of laughter effec
tively drown any opposition?
As December neared an end, special session num
ber three was called to clean up 27 other bills further
fortifying Mr. Long and rounding out his revenges. One
of these measures Huey explained to the Ways and
Means Committee as concerning only financial adjust
ments for schools whose pupils crossed parish lines.
When it proved later to give Huey power to
hire and fire all school teachers, previously com
placent and cowering Representative Lester sput
tered: "We, as legislators, are called upon to take
from the people the last vestige of their local
political rights . . . thus placing us in the unen
viable position of putty-faced stooges."
During football season, the Senator made a big play
for student support with band-leading and preposterous
bragging about L.S.U.'s prowess. (E.g.—He offered to
lick both Alabama and Minnesota in one day with any
11 men from the squad. Such blatancy leads to little
faith being placed in his statements by thinking people.)
The movement to pit youth against the moss-backs
took a bad setback when the "Reveille" closed down,
and 26 L.S.U. journalism students went on strike, as an
aftermath of his suppressing a hostile student letter and
instituting a faculty censor. Utah's Senator Thomas
lost no time in announcing—probably quite correctly
—that Huey's action would prove a stumbling-block
in any presidential race he might make.
Tomorrow we glance at finances in Louisiana
under this super-boss and extraordinary juggler.

bragging about L.S.U.'s prowess. (E.g.—He offered to
lick both Alabama and Minnesota in one day with any
11 men from the squad. Such blatancy leads to little
faith being placed in his statements by thinking people.)
The movement to pit youth against the moss-backs
took a bad setback when the "Reveille" closed down,
and 26 L.S.U. journalism students went on strike, as an
aftermath of his suppressing a hostile student letter and
instituting a faculty censor. Utah's Senator Thomas
lost no time in announcing—probably quite correctly
—that Huey's action would prove a stumbling-block
in any presidential race he might make.
Tomorrow we glance at finances in Louisiana
under this super-boss and extraordinary juggler.
(Editor's Note—The Daily presents the second
of a series on "man of the people" Huey I'. Long,
ranting Senator, who was heard 011 NBC Saturday, "
when he said. "There's only one way to save
America—that is to pull wealth down from the
top and distribute it to those at the bottom, God
told us just exactly how to do it all.")
When Long left the governorship to represent Loui
siana in the Senate, he was securely entrenched within
his own state. A multitude of henchmen on the pay
rolls and control of all assessing in the state were his
bulwarks. Long's pals found the assessed valuation of
their property surprisingly low, but antis found re
markable soaring in assessed*worth of their holdings.
Huey left behind a dummy governor, O. K. Allen,
and a smooth running slate machine. Even so, many
nought n.s influence was waning and at the opening
of 1934 believed he was on the downgrade. They were
mistaken. Long's banner year was 1934. His once
fantastic ambition to occupy the White House seems
less of a jo*ke daily.
The year opened with T. Semnies Walmsley and
cohorts heating the Long adherents soundly in
New Orleans elections. But Huey's puppet legis
lature fixed that. In a rapid summer session it
passed laws that to all intents pardoned crooks
retroactively and in advance. Simultaneously, cor
poration taxes were boosted, and punitive taxes
put on utilities and newspapers.
Huey was in the saddle for the elections. With
special deputies, $5 per day officers, and the militia at
his command, with judicial power radically curbed,
Huey moved into New Orleans, loudly proclaiming that
he was fighting vice of all breeds and the Tammany
like Walmsley crowd.
Unfortunately for the latter, their skirts were in
reality rather dirty. New Orleans knew it, and for
getting about the many state vices of the Long machine,
snowed Walmsley under by a phenomenal margin. In
order not to antagonize the vice vote, which was con
siderable, Long's ward-heelers had promised enough
protection to counteract his clamorous denouncements
from radio and platform of gambling, prostitution,
and all.
In November of last year, Huey P. blazed anew in
the front pages. Reason: the 44 bills, and the suppres
sion of "Reveille."
The oft-cited batch of bills was rubber-stamped
by a public assembly in an open manner never
before approached in this country for sheer brazen
ness. Huey was in the legislative chambers per
sonally to see that there were no slip-ups. To the
committees, he explained the gist of the bills. To
the assembly, he explained he'd read them, that
they were okay, and hence that further reading
would be superfluous. Only a handful were read
farther than the title before being passed.
One bill repealed the Corrupt Practices Act, so
that Huey's candidates would not have to be bothered
by details such as accounting for the source of their
campaign contributions. Now, job-holders pay from
10 to 20 per cent of their salaries into slush funds.
Judges who oppose moratorium laws find themselves
without benches, after Huey places these funds behind
his judicial candidates. Many a boss throughout the
land watches enviously as Huey places both ends
against the middle.
Others put the local fire and police chiefs under the
Long thumb. Huey admitted he was out to "get" those
obnoxious to him—such as the Alexandria police chief
who let a mob rotten-egg him last year. The bar asso
ciation practically lost all control over lawyers.
Another was destined to "take the kinks out of the
old income tax law." The one anti-Long man in the
legislature asked Huey if he meant the "old income
tax law of 1934?" The "dictator's" reply: "Yes, we're
moving so fast now I expect babies to be talking at
six months." Logical? Maybe not, but who needs
logic when he has stooges so afraid not to laugh at
His Mightiness' gags that their gales of laughter effec
tively drown any opposition?
As December neared an end, special session num
ber three was called to clean up 27 other bills further
fortifying Mr. Long and rounding out his revenges. One
of these measures Huey explained to the Ways and
Means Committee as concerning only financial adjust
ments for schools whose pupils crossed parish lines.
When it proved later to give Huey power to
hire and fire all school teachers, previously com
placent and cowering Representative Lester sput
tered: "We, as legislators, are called upon to take
from the people the last vestige of their local
political rights . . . thus placing us in the unen
viable position of putty-faced stooges."

His Mightiness' gags that their gales of laughter effec
tively drown any opposition?
As December neared an end, special session num
ber three was called to clean up 27 other bills further
fortifying Mr. Long and rounding out his revenges. One
of these measures Huey explained to the Ways and
Means Committee as concerning only financial adjust
ments for schools whose pupils crossed parish lines.
When it proved later to give Huey power to
hire and fire all school teachers, previously com
placent and cowering Representative Lester sput
tered: "We, as legislators, are called upon to take
from the people the last vestige of their local
political rights . . . thus placing us in the unen
viable position of putty-faced stooges."
During football season, the Senator made a big play
for student support with band-leading and preposterous
bragging about L.S.U.'s prowess. (E.g.—He offered to
lick both Alabama and Minnesota in one day with any
11 men from the squad. Such blatancy leads to little
faith being placed in his statements by thinking people.)
The movement to pit youth against the moss-backs
took a bad setback when the "Reveille" closed down,
and 26 L.S.U. journalism students went on strike, as an
aftermath of his suppressing a hostile student letter and
instituting a faculty censor. Utah's Senator Thomas
lost no time in announcing—probably quite correctly
—that Huey's action would prove a stumbling-block
in any presidential race he might make.
Tomorrow we glance at finances in Louisiana
under this super-boss and extraordinary juggler.
(Editor's Note—The Daily presents the second
of a series on "man of the people" Huey I'. Long,
ranting Senator, who was heard 011 NBC Saturday, "
when he said. "There's only one way to save
America—that is to pull wealth down from the
top and distribute it to those at the bottom, God
told us just exactly how to do it all.")
When Long left the governorship to represent Loui
siana in the Senate, he was securely entrenched within
his own state. A multitude of henchmen on the pay
rolls and control of all assessing in the state were his
bulwarks. Long's pals found the assessed valuation of
their property surprisingly low, but antis found re
markable soaring in assessed*worth of their holdings.
Huey left behind a dummy governor, O. K. Allen,
and a smooth running slate machine. Even so, many
nought n.s influence was waning and at the opening
of 1934 believed he was on the downgrade. They were
mistaken. Long's banner year was 1934. His once
fantastic ambition to occupy the White House seems
less of a jo*ke daily.
The year opened with T. Semnies Walmsley and
cohorts heating the Long adherents soundly in
New Orleans elections. But Huey's puppet legis
lature fixed that. In a rapid summer session it
passed laws that to all intents pardoned crooks
retroactively and in advance. Simultaneously, cor
poration taxes were boosted, and punitive taxes
put on utilities and newspapers.
Huey was in the saddle for the elections. With
special deputies, $5 per day officers, and the militia at
his command, with judicial power radically curbed,
Huey moved into New Orleans, loudly proclaiming that
he was fighting vice of all breeds and the Tammany
like Walmsley crowd.
Unfortunately for the latter, their skirts were in
reality rather dirty. New Orleans knew it, and for
getting about the many state vices of the Long machine,
snowed Walmsley under by a phenomenal margin. In
order not to antagonize the vice vote, which was con
siderable, Long's ward-heelers had promised enough
protection to counteract his clamorous denouncements
from radio and platform of gambling, prostitution,
and all.
In November of last year, Huey P. blazed anew in
the front pages. Reason: the 44 bills, and the suppres
sion of "Reveille."
The oft-cited batch of bills was rubber-stamped
by a public assembly in an open manner never
before approached in this country for sheer brazen
ness. Huey was in the legislative chambers per
sonally to see that there were no slip-ups. To the
committees, he explained the gist of the bills. To
the assembly, he explained he'd read them, that
they were okay, and hence that further reading
would be superfluous. Only a handful were read
farther than the title before being passed.
One bill repealed the Corrupt Practices Act, so
that Huey's candidates would not have to be bothered
by details such as accounting for the source of their
campaign contributions. Now, job-holders pay from
10 to 20 per cent of their salaries into slush funds.
Judges who oppose moratorium laws find themselves
without benches, after Huey places these funds behind
his judicial candidates. Many a boss throughout the
land watches enviously as Huey places both ends
against the middle.
Others put the local fire and police chiefs under the
Long thumb. Huey admitted he was out to "get" those
obnoxious to him—such as the Alexandria police chief
who let a mob rotten-egg him last year. The bar asso
ciation practically lost all control over lawyers.
Another was destined to "take the kinks out of the
old income tax law." The one anti-Long man in the
legislature asked Huey if he meant the "old income
tax law of 1934?" The "dictator's" reply: "Yes, we're
moving so fast now I expect babies to be talking at
six months." Logical? Maybe not, but who needs
logic when he has stooges so afraid not to laugh at
His Mightiness' gags that their gales of laughter effec
tively drown any opposition?
