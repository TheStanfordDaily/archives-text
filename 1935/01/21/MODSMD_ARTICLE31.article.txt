Lieutenant Commander Herbert V. Wiley of the
navy dirigible Macon, in an interview Saturday told of
the newly perfected Fischer radio-direction finder.
The radio mechanism is the brain-child of
I)r. Gerhart Fischer, a young radio engineer
living in Palo Alto, who has used the Macon as a
''laboratory" for many months as a means of per
fecting his invention. On recent trips the device
has proven its indisputable reliability and worth
to the satisfaction of Commander Wiley. Dr. Fischer,
and the Macon communications officer.
The instrument, which weighs about 40 pounds, rests
in the control room of the Macon. It might be called a
"visual radio compass" for broadcasted radio waves
draw a needle's point to the zero position on a dial,
indicating the Macon is headed toward the precise
source of the radio waves.
"This radio direction-finding apparatus makes it
virtually impossible to get lost on either land or
sea. provided the Macon's radio reception is un
impaired," states Commander Wiley. "We have
been hundreds of miles out over the Pacific in
dense fogs and flown to shore without difficulty
by the use of Fischer's instrument."
Commander Wiley explains that compact replica.'-!
of this invention of very light weight may be manu
factured for use in commercial and private planes.
While steering for a certain point by the use of the
radio-compass, it is not necessary to limit radio
receptivity, or to blank out any other broadcasting
or signals. Fischer's instrument is also practically
immune from the so-called night effect and fading
of radio waves.
Patents for the apparatus are held by the United
States government, states Commander Wiley, with
commercial rights reserved by the inventor.
