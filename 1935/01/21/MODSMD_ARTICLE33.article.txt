Periodically there is a vice ex- I
pose in San Francisco. Periodically, j
the good citizens of the Bay City are ;
"astonished" to learn that Market !
Street and environs are dripping !
with sin. that young and "innocent" I
girls are being plied with drink and j
lured on to the toboggan that ends ;
in Hell. Sermons begin to fly* and
the air is thick with resolutions.
Then eyebrows are raised still
higher: not only does vice flourish,
but the business is protected and ,
aided by the San Francisco police. '
At this point the civic betterment
organizations get busy, a thorough
going investigation is demanded,
night clubs close at 2 o'clock, police
suddenly begin to make arrests, a
few dubs take the rap: then San
Francisco is pure again.
j
That is the formula. When it has
been completely executed, every- ,
thing slides back to normal, until the
next expose.
The good people of the City on the |
Bay do not like to admit to them
selves that organized vice is as
much a part of "normal" San Fran
cisco, as the ferries, or the dock, or
Market Street itself. And so when a
shake-up comes, they content them
selves with making the police de
partment the scapegoat for the whole
affair. To balm their own con
sciences, they are more than ready
to accept the explanation of one San
Francisco newspaper: to-wit, the
goodness of citizenry varies directly
with the goodness of the police.
Never was cause and effect so
reversed. If San Francisco police are
corrupt, it is because the good people
of San Francisco want corrupt po
licemen. If vice exists in San Fran
cisco, it is not only because it satis
fies a definite need in the commun
ity; but because the people who de
termine the destinies of the city find '
advantage in the existence of such
conditions. The honest cop who per
sonally attempts to crack down on a
single bawdy-house, or gambling
joint will not last five minutes on the
police force of San Francisco, or of ;

any other big city.
The men who own the buildings
which house vice and all the rest
will never consent to have their in
vestment jeopardized. They will tol
erate the nuisance of intermittent
investigations; that's all in the busi
ness. But any real interference they
will not brook. Against them, a puny
officer on the beat is That
is normal San Francisco. *
