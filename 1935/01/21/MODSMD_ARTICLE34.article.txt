# CAMPUS OPINION
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
In this day and age of intelligent
collegiate publication with supposed
intelligent contributors one is led to l
believe that all that is written and
contained therein is of intellectual
and intrinsic value, especially in such
co|umns entitled Campus Opinion.
However, I am of another nature in i
re to such beliefs. It is generally |
taken for granted that campus opin- \
ion columns are for those students |
; desiring to "express themselves." But |
in the last few days I have been led
to believe they are for the sole pur
j pose of amusing the readers such as
( a comic strip is for the amusement of
a child (and me).
The latest argument (hat has been :
going back and forth in that column j
has beer* quite humorous. Little has I
( been actually said or accomplished,
j but bombshells and insinuating re
marks have been flying back and
forth with great rapidity. One gen- j
I tleman makes a statement, the vera- j
city of which is in doubt, and im- I
mediately a dissenter wishes to be ,
. permitted to "talk over" the head of ,
I the editor so that he might reply 1.) j
I Mr. Norman Sears in the latter's j
I own language. Both men reach a j
j white heat and attempt to make an 1
I example of the other. It really i.s >
! quite languid in procedure as well as
i being amusing to the reader.
I I cannot say that I agree in en- 1
' tirety with either gentleman; how- !
| ever, I have found (in my opinion) i
S several obvious truths in the beliefs !
j of both—as well as several, if I may, |
| very obvious untruths. I can readily j
see by that which has gone before !
i that if I would attempt to criticize
either truth or untruth I would be
literally swamped by intelligent
"open-minded" persons denouncing
me as a narrow-minded radical or n
Red.
! As far as I can see, social needs
! should not take up an em of space
: in your illustrious column, Campus
i Opinion. Those needs should be left
i to someone else—such as Mr. Mel
-1 linkoff, who by his great work has
I afforded great amusement for many
i of us so-called "Communistic col
i legians" (someone's def. of a stu
j dent). I am not in the least, criticiz
ing Mr. Mellinkoff, but his beliefs,
although often sound in fact, are
j more often sound in humor—for his
jis personal opinion, also. And this is
; mine. Sincerely,
Charles Voigt
