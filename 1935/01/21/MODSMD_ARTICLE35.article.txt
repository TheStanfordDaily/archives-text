"ONE HOUR LATE''
At the Varsity Theatre
Gracefully, this little number falls
1 into the category of the superlative.
| For, without a doubt, it is the worst
] crate of tripe ever disclosed by the
j "cinemuh's" varied regurgigtations.

The cast, includ
ing be a u t e ous
Helen Twelve
trees and Joe
Morrison, a new
comer who has a
voice, struggles
rather nobly
through the mire

by amateurish, inept direction; bal
derdash dialogue; and a moronic
story. Our tip is to dodge this baby
• even if an Irish sweepstakes tickct
j comes with it. —Brill
