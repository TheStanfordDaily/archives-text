## ANOTHER OBJECTION TO ALL-AMERICAS 
### 
All-America teams, since the days
when pickers could actually watch
all or nearly all of the players chos
en, have been the bunk. There are
many objections, but just one more
was called to attention by Edward
J. Nell, Associated Press columnist.
The all-slar elevens are always
chosen at the close of regular sea
sons in November, and they elimi
nate all post-season games in their
consideration. The Rose Bowl ha
hituuliy either proves, or com
pletely disproves one or more ath
let's claim to the distinction. In
recent years, the Notre Dame-
Southern California game has
shown up some of the All-Ameri
ean selections, announced before
the game was played. And so on
with the other post-season con
tests.
In his On The Sidelines column,
Mr. Neil, in collaboration with a
Southern scribe, analyzed the situa
tion as far us Dixie Howell, Alabama
flash, was concerned:
"The trouble was that very few
writers picked Howell on their all-
Americas. They feel that the boys
;.re snickering behind their backs,
perhaps, but what can they say?
"I didn't have to pick an all-Amer
ica, but if I had had to, Howell, on
the basis of returns available late in
November, wouldn't have been on
it. Since Edwin Camp, who writes a
highly penetrating column called
"Ole Timer" in the Atlanta Journal,
feels much the same, with hLs per
mission we'll collaborate from here
on.
