"Ole Timer analyzes the situation
perfectly as follows:
" 'It seems to me the criticism, in
so far as it applies personally to Mr.
Rice or to Mr. Gould of the Associa
ted Press, is unfair. In so far as it
applies to the selecting of all-Amer
ica teams at all, it seems to me to be
valid, for it has been my contention
for years that they are primarily the
bunk. In so far as it applies to ihe
selection by anybody of an all-
America team in mid-November,
Howell's performance has shown
conclusively the absurdity of that
custom.
"It can be said that on November
15 or thereabouts, few competent
observers in the South were able to
say which of three men—Howell,
Simons of Tulane, or Mickal of L.
S. U.—was the best all-round back.
To the keen eye, Howell's unique
competitive stretch had been ob
vious for two reasons, but save in
punting his pre-eminence had not |
been established by performance.
