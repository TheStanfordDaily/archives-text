# Frosh Trounce Sacramento High, 38-15
## HANK LUISETTI IS HIGH SCORER FOR STANFORD SQUAD Bradshaw's Men Cinch Win With 15-Point Lead At Half-Time 
### Gordon Frost 
Over another hurdle went Coach
Jimmy Bradshaw's frosh basketball
squad Saturday night when they
trounced Sacramento High School,
38-15. Again Hank Luisetti led the
Sfanford scorers, tallying 16 points
for the evening to be followed bj
Bob Zonne with nine. Bud Law
rence was high for Sacramento with
9 points to his credit.
Spectators saw an even-up hall
game until the middle of the first
quarter when the Cardinals took
the lead to end the period 11-G.
In the second quarter the papoose
cagers ran the score to 27-12. Dick
Lyon replaced Clarence Maurer
and he and Luisetti were respon
sible for most of the Indian bas
kets during this second period.
In the third quarter the papooses
failed to click and the scoreboard
j;tood 33-13 at the end of that period.
Passing became less accurate and
baskets weren't forthcoming. Con
sequently Coach BracLshaw gave
some of his second stringers i: chance
to see action.
The reserves found it difficult, as
had the regulars, to again hit their
early game precision but neverthe
less the Bradshaw-coached quintet
left the floor after the gun with a
38-15 victory neatly tucked under
its belt.
High school rules were in order
during the evening providing rest
period after each quarter as well as
at half time.
Bradshaw declared after the game
that he was quite satisfied with the
team's showing with the exception
of the fast break which he plans to
work on during the week's practice
sessions. Next Friday and Satur
day nights the babe cagers meet
Galileo High School and Santa Clai'a.
