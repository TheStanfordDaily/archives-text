WASHINGTON, Jan. 20 (TP).â€”"The
invention and development of the
typewriter has opened more jobs to
women than any other single ma
chine," said a review by the women's
bureau of its first extensive study of
feminine white collar workers.
The Washington Monument, which
has stood 50 years without repairs, is
being "overhauled." The crumbling
mortar between the blocks is being
replaced.
