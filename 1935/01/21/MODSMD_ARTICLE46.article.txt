## 
### 
KEZAR STADIUM, SAN FRAN- !
CISCO, Jan. 20 (/P).— I The Now York
Giants gave a convincing demonstra
tion today of why the 1934 national
professional football championship
belongs to them when they battered
their way to a 21 to 0 victory over
the Pacific Coast All-Stars before a
post-season crowd of 20,000 fans.
The encounter, sponsored by ihe 1
Knights of Columbus as a charity af- j
fair, developed into a disastrous roui !
for the collegians coached by Ernie
Nevers, himself a former pro star.
Shortly after the kickoff the Giants J
crashed over for the first of three i
touchdowns. It climaxed a 53-yard i
drive with Danowski passing four
yards to Flaherty, who caught the j
ball over the goal line.
Another touchdown followed im- I
mediately. Homer Griffith, former <

University of Southern California
quarterback, acting in the same ca
pacity for the coast team, fumbled
the kickoff. Danowski was on hand
Ito fall on the ball on the 20-yard
! line. A pass, Danowski to Burnett,
: netted 13 yards. Ken Strong went
' through the line to score and for the
second time added the extra point
1 with a straight place kick.
A scoreless second period saw the j
! coast stars miss a field goal try from j
the 35-yard line with Schammel do- !
| ing the booting.
In the third quarter the Giants !
capitalized on another fumble for
j their final touchdown. Danowski \
threw two passes, one to Frankiau j
and the other to Burnett, who carried i
the ball over. Danowski made the
I conversion.
Only once did the coast team j
! threaten. It was in the second period. I
Taking the ball on a blocked kick, 1
! the all-star squad advanced from tho '
I Giants' 26-yard line to the 4-yard !
mark, only to lose the oval on an
interception.
Willis Smith, midget quarterback
of the Giants, played a few minutes j
in the last quarter and gave the
j crowd several thrills with his fancy j
jfootwork, especially on a'punt re-j
j turn of 34 yards. i

KEZAR STADIUM, SAN FRAN- !
CISCO, Jan. 20 (/P).— I The Now York
Giants gave a convincing demonstra
tion today of why the 1934 national
professional football championship
belongs to them when they battered
their way to a 21 to 0 victory over
the Pacific Coast All-Stars before a
post-season crowd of 20,000 fans.
The encounter, sponsored by ihe 1
Knights of Columbus as a charity af- j
fair, developed into a disastrous roui !
for the collegians coached by Ernie
Nevers, himself a former pro star.
Shortly after the kickoff the Giants J
crashed over for the first of three i
touchdowns. It climaxed a 53-yard i
drive with Danowski passing four
yards to Flaherty, who caught the j
ball over the goal line.
Another touchdown followed im- I
mediately. Homer Griffith, former <

University of Southern California
quarterback, acting in the same ca
pacity for the coast team, fumbled
the kickoff. Danowski was on hand
Ito fall on the ball on the 20-yard
! line. A pass, Danowski to Burnett,
: netted 13 yards. Ken Strong went
' through the line to score and for the
second time added the extra point
1 with a straight place kick.
A scoreless second period saw the j
! coast stars miss a field goal try from j
the 35-yard line with Schammel do- !
| ing the booting.
In the third quarter the Giants !
capitalized on another fumble for
j their final touchdown. Danowski \
threw two passes, one to Frankiau j
and the other to Burnett, who carried i
the ball over. Danowski made the
I conversion.
Only once did the coast team j
! threaten. It was in the second period. I
Taking the ball on a blocked kick, 1
! the all-star squad advanced from tho '
I Giants' 26-yard line to the 4-yard !
mark, only to lose the oval on an
interception.

of the Giants, played a few minutes j
in the last quarter and gave the
j crowd several thrills with his fancy j
jfootwork, especially on a'punt re-j
j turn of 34 yards. i
