## Part of Science in Solving Crimes Is Subject 
### 
"The Use of Scientific Methods in
the Identification of the Criminal"
will be the subject of an illustrated
lecture to be given at 4 o'clock to
morrow afternoon in the Assembly
Hall by Dr. Jo Howard Mathews,
executive head of the Department of
Chemistry of the University of Wis
consin.
Applies New Methods
Professor Mathews is one of the
few scientists of the United States
to take up crime detection as an avo
cation, and he has been instrumental
in solving a number of murder mys
teries. His work is unique in a num
ber of ways as he has applied scien
tific methods previously unknown in
this field.
In his talk he will show, by means
of lantern slides, how certain murder
mysteries have been solved and the
identity of the criminal established.
The instruments used in modem sci
entific crime detection will be pic
tured and described.

and M. A. degrees at the University
of Wisconsin and M. A. and Ph.D.
degrees at Harvard University. He
has served as a member of the faculty
of the University of Wisconsin since
1908.
Professor Mathews is founder of
Alpha Chi Sigma fraternity (1902)
and the National Colloid Symposium
(1923). He was a captain and a major
in the ordinance department during
the World War, and is a member of
