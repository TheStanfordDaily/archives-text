"THE ZIEGFELD FOLLIES" at the
Curran Theatre, (S. F.).
One man got hysterical and had to
be carried out â€”but I don't think the
show merited such explosive indica
tions of approbation. Flo' Ziegfeld's
"glorification" of the American girl
has become such a byword that ju.it
the word "Follies" induces visions ol
feminine su-perfection, lavishly ex
ploited. But when the "Follies" were
in their hey-day, some fifteen odd
years ago, Broadway's Great White
Way was America's play goal, and
Fanchon and Marco's three-arday
and Warner Brother's cinematic ex
travaganzas hadn't been heard of.
So the "Follies" are bound to disap
point those having any pre-con
ceived ideas about their originality
or unusualness; even the chorus was
perfectly normal as to bodily attire.
But the girls are beautiful, there
are several musical hits, the stars
are in the top-notch class, and the
production has more polish than is
usually seen "west of the Mississip
pi." And the show is conclusive
proof that New York can still teach
Hollywood a few things when it
comes to putting on an old-fash
ioned revue.
Fannie Brice, of course, furnishes
about thirty-five per cent of ihe
laughs. Her "fan dance" is a triumph
in farce-satire. And, as "Baby
Snooks," "Soul Saving Sadie," and
"Sarah, the Sunshine Girl," we see
that her comedy becomes more hys
terically humorous with repetition.
By the time that Fannie, as Sarah,
the Nudist, stuck her big toe "in de
leetle barrook," several members of
the audience were ready to be car
ried out.
And then, Harrison and Fisher
dance. And dancing, as used in con
nection with these two artists, takes
on a new connotation. The grace
and uniform ease of their synchron
ized movements is of superb beauty.
Their interpretations range from the
humorous, through the romantic and
sophisticated, to a modern, machin
istic climax in a number called "To
the Beat of the Heart."
Willie and Eugene Howard are
versatile comedians, winning laughs,
variedly, as communists, theatre
managers, politicians, cowboys, sail
ors, Russian violinists, and, finally,
as the operatic graduates of a bar
ber's college.
Outstanding songs were "Water
