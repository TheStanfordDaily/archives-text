Further word hits been received
from the two Stanford undergradu
a.tes, William C. KuzeJl and Williatn
A. Mingst, who are now exchange
students at Lingnan University,
Canton, China,
Mingst writes that he is "swamped
with work." He is planning an ex
cursion when the« first semester
ends, but states: "It is rather im
portant that we take the Commun
ist armies and their recent activities
into consideration before we go on
our jaunt."
Chinese Tricky
Speaking of his effort to master
the Chinese tongue, Mingst observes:
"Chinese is one of the trickiest of
languages and it is very hard to get
those nine tones — nine Cantonese,
five Mandarin — right every time.
I have noticed that I am able to un
derstand a bit of the normal conver
sation with fair accuracy, but my
speech is limited to ordering food
and the other common everyday
small items. I can say the same
word twice and the first time it will
be understood by all, while the sec
ond attempt, seemingly in the exact
tone to me, is a miserable failure as
far as the Chinese are concerned."
Mingst says*he sings in the uni
versity choir and glee club, and that
his "chief form of exercise is cycling
about Honam Island." The island,
which is 12 miles long and 3 wide,
has 72 villages, and its chief industry
is weaving.
Mingst an Editor
Lingnan News-Letter is the name
of a newly published organ of the
exchange students of the Pacific area.
Mingst is one of the co-editors. One
of the articles describes a trip taken
by a group including Mingst through
the country surrounding Canton.
Armed with sun-helmets and um
brellas, the party seemed to be
travelling in a virtual orientalesque
paradise. They returned from their
destination of Shiu-Chow on the
Canton express at the prodigious
speed of 18 miles an hour.
Sweden has announced a project
for taking care of unemployed youth
similar to the CCC camps in the
United States.
