# Lagunita Filled To Brim, Surpassing All Records,
## 
### 
Surpassing all records for the pe-
riod of the year, Lake Lagunita was
filled to its capacity of 117 million
gallons by the rains of the past week.
Searsville Lake is also completely
filled, totaling over 305 million gal
lons.
Water is being drained from La-
gunita because seepage from the
lake has come up in the basement
and kitchen of Lagunita Court. The
gage near the boathouse does not
measure the depth of the lake but
the elevation above sea level,
With the Lagunita opening Sat
urday, nearly all the canoes were in
use over the week-end. Four upsets
have been recorded up to yesterday.
