# Lagunita Filled To Brim, Surpassing All Records,
## 
### 
I Surpassing all records for the pe- [
| riod of the year, Lake Lagunita was ,
filled to its capacity of 117 million |
| gallons by the rains of the past week, j
] Searsville Lake is also completely
filled, totaling over 305 million gal
lons.
Water is being drained from La- j
gunita because seepage from the
i lake has come up in the basement!
and kitchen of Lagunita Court. The j
| gage near the boathouse does not!
: measure the depth of the lake but
I the elevation above sea level,
With the Lagunita opening Sat
i urday, nearly all the canoes were in i
! use over the week-end. Four upsets
| have been recorded up to yesterday.
