# REBUILDING OF OVAL BACKED BY BILL ELLINGTON
## Improvements Needed For Angell Field Told By Assistant Coach 
### Loren Irwin 
As persistent rumors and sugges
tions as to how the B.A.C. might
spend its money float around the
campus, track mentors wait resign
edly for .improvements which they
claim should have long since been
made on Angell Field.
According to Bill Ellington, as
sistant track coach, and members
of the track squad Angell Field
is "no angel" in its present con
dition. The brick foundation is
beginning to work its way through
the now meager covering of clay
and cinders on the track which
was constructed way back in '07
and has had no improvements
since.
In addition the inner track is
crowded by a large eucalyptus tree
into such a small space that pros
pective track men are in constant
danger of finding themselves made
the target of some slightly erratic
javelin thrower. It is only through
good fortune, says Bill Ellington,
that some serious accident has not
already occurred.
Fill-in Necessary
Plans for improvement, which
have been ready for some time ia
anticipation of funds with which to
carry them out, provide for a com
plete rearrangement of the inner
track.
At present a depression exists in
the middle of this field. This should
be filled and the entire field smooth
ed in order to provide for the events
taking place there, according to El
lington. The eucalyptus tree should
be removed so that space might be
provided for a longer and safer jave
lin range.
With this accomplished a complete
rearrangement of the location of field
events might be made.
Most important of all, however,
is the remodeling of the track it
self with an addition of enough
width to provide for an extra lane
for hurdlers. This would give room
for six men to run at the same
time. Enough clay and cinders to
cover the track to a depth of about
two inches should be imported and
laid for a more comfortable and
less injurious running space.
Should these improvements be
made, all meets could be held on
Angell Field rather than in the sta
dium, concluded Ellington. â€¢
Teams Good
Sam Klopstock, winner of the
1.C.4-A low hurdles and the N.C.A.A.
high hurdles last spring pointed out
that "The first part of any money
to be distributed should go to the
improvement of Angell Field.
"Since the track teams have been j
consistently good for the past eight
years, they deserve first considers- !
tion. Track teams, nationally known,
should at least receive notice over j
intramural .sports teams."
