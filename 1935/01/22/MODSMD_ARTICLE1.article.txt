# COURT REFUSES MOONEY'S PLEA FOR REHEARING
## Case Thrown Back, but Way Pointed for Eventual Release Action COURT REBUKES STATE Plaintiff Has Not Exhausted All Legal Rights 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 21 (/J I ).—Tom
Mooney's plea that the Supreme
Court take up his case was rejected
today, but the tribunal pointed out
another legal road which eventu
ally may lead to freedom for the
famous prisoner.
The court said in effect that Cali
fornia's court should free Mooney
if he had been convicted on perjured
testimony; that he had the legal
right to ask for a writ of habeas
corpus in the state and that all argu
ments that technicalities prevented
further action in his case were wrong.
18-Ycar Attempt
Mooney has been attempting to
obtain his freedom for 18 years. In
requesting that the Supreme Court
allow him to file a writ of habeas
corpus, he claimed that legal techni
calities blocked his attempt to get
the state courts to free him. Mooney
contended he had evidence that the
testimony which resulted in his con
viction was perjured at the instance
of the state.
The state took the view that the
snarls of legal procedure were
such that Mooney's conviction
could not be set aside. But the
court thought otherwise in lan
guage that was a rebuke to his
contention.

Chief Justice Hughes called this
view narrow.
He said in stern words that the due
process requirement of the Constitu
tion was not satisfied by technicali
ties "if a state has contrived a con
viction through the pretense of a
train which in truth is but used as a
means of depriving a defendant of
liberty through a deliberate decep
tion of court and jury by the pre
sentation of testimony known to be
perjured."
"Such a contrivance by a state to
procure the conviction and imprison
ment of a defendant is as incon
sistent with the rudimentary de
mands of justice as is the obtain
ing of a like result by intimidation,"
the Chief Justice said.
