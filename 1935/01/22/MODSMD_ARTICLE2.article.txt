—How Bruno Richard Hauptmana
suddenly quit his carpenter's' job
when the Lindbergh ransom was
paid and plunged in fat figures on
Wall Street was told to his murder
trial jury today.
Tomorrow, prosecutors indicate
they hope to rest their case against
the accused kidnap-killer of the fa
mous baby.
After a Treasury agent had reeled
of! figures that disclosed marginal
stock purchased of $256,442.15 in
1933, the timekeeper of a New York
apartment project produced books
this afternoon to show that Haupt
mann failed to work on April 2, 1932,
and returned only once after that.
It was on April 2, 1932, that Dr.
John F. "Jafsie" Condon paid tha
$50,000 to a man he has identified as
Hauptmann in a Bronx cemetery.
Since then, the state says it can
prove, the once thrifty carpenter
fingered every cent of the ransom
money, tossing most of it into the
stock market, spending some of it on
himself, and hiding the rest.
