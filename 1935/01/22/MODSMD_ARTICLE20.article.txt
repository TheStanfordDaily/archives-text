# PROSE FICTION IS OUTLINED ON RADIO PROGRAM
## Prof. McClelland Gives Six Points Necessary For Successful Story 
### 
"The essentials of lasting literary
quality," as defined by John McClel
land, assistant professor of English,
over station KGO's Stanford Hour at
8 o'clock last night, can be summed
up in six points when applied to
prose fiction:
"First—needless to say—a contin
uously interesting, coherent, and
convincing story.
"Second, characters suitably devel
oped in relation to the requirements
of that story.
Setting Necessary
"Third, a setting for the story—
notes on houses, places, and the like
—suitably indicated, which, without
being obstrusively labored, shall em
phasize the convincingness of char
acters and action.
"Fourth, disciplined intelligence:
a comprehension of the realities cf
life, and a sense of the difference that
must forever exist between the
things that matter and the things
that do not matter in this world.
"Fifth, individuality. The novelist
must stand on his own feet and see
with his own eyes. He must not be
a mere imitator of someone else, or a
mere mouthpiece for a society or a
social group.
"Sixth, and last, sympathy: an un
derstanding of the inner lives and
motives and desires of the characters
whom he depicts: a 'feel' for the
complexities of human psychoiogy
and human emotion."
Granted the possession of these
attributes, a work of fiction may
hope to outlive the generation
which gave it birth, and become
novels of which cultivated persons
feel that they really ought to know
something; the novels that, for
whatever reason, and for however
long a period, really do "count."
"The Red Badge of Courage," by
Stephen Crane, and "McTeague," by
Frank Norris, are two examples from
the last decade of the 19th century
which are still "alive" and which are
already ranked with world classics.

Continuing the series on vitality in
literature, Professor Yvor Winters
will analyze the qualities of vitality
of poetry on January 28, and George
Hinkle will discuss criticism from
the same viewpoint on February 4.
Professor McClelland has received
three degrees from Stanford, the
B.A. in 1924, the M.A. in 1925, and
the Ph.D. in 1933. He has been en
the Stanford faculty since 1925.

"Fifth, individuality. The novelist
must stand on his own feet and see
with his own eyes. He must not be
a mere imitator of someone else, or a
mere mouthpiece for a society or a
social group.
"Sixth, and last, sympathy: an un
derstanding of the inner lives and
motives and desires of the characters
whom he depicts: a 'feel' for the
complexities of human psychoiogy
and human emotion."
Granted the possession of these
attributes, a work of fiction may
hope to outlive the generation
which gave it birth, and become
novels of which cultivated persons
feel that they really ought to know
something; the novels that, for
whatever reason, and for however
long a period, really do "count."
"The Red Badge of Courage," by
Stephen Crane, and "McTeague," by
Frank Norris, are two examples from
the last decade of the 19th century
which are still "alive" and which are
already ranked with world classics.
Winters Speaks Next
Continuing the series on vitality in
literature, Professor Yvor Winters
will analyze the qualities of vitality
of poetry on January 28, and George
Hinkle will discuss criticism from
the same viewpoint on February 4.
Professor McClelland has received
three degrees from Stanford, the
B.A. in 1924, the M.A. in 1925, and
the Ph.D. in 1933. He has been en
the Stanford faculty since 1925.
"The essentials of lasting literary
quality," as defined by John McClel
land, assistant professor of English,
over station KGO's Stanford Hour at
8 o'clock last night, can be summed
up in six points when applied to
prose fiction:
"First—needless to say—a contin
uously interesting, coherent, and
convincing story.
"Second, characters suitably devel
oped in relation to the requirements
of that story.
Setting Necessary
"Third, a setting for the story—
notes on houses, places, and the like
—suitably indicated, which, without
being obstrusively labored, shall em
phasize the convincingness of char
acters and action.
"Fourth, disciplined intelligence:
a comprehension of the realities cf
life, and a sense of the difference that
must forever exist between the
things that matter and the things
that do not matter in this world.
"Fifth, individuality. The novelist
must stand on his own feet and see
with his own eyes. He must not be
a mere imitator of someone else, or a
mere mouthpiece for a society or a
social group.
"Sixth, and last, sympathy: an un
derstanding of the inner lives and
motives and desires of the characters
whom he depicts: a 'feel' for the
complexities of human psychoiogy
and human emotion."
