# COUNCIL MOVES TO POOL MONEY
## Recommend New Building For Publications 
### 
Recommending that The Daily
managing editor be given a salary
and that in the iuture the three stu
dent publications pool their resources
to erect a publications building, Pub
lications Council met yesterday af
ternoon in the Press Building.
Drawing up a statement of its po
sition, the Council will make the
following recommendation to Ex
Committee: "In view of the fact that
the student manager has tabled the
matter without action, the Publica
tions Council recommends to the Ex
Committee that beginning with vol
ume 87 (next half year )of the Stan
ford Daily, the managing editor re
ceive a monthly salary of $20 plus a
5 per cent share of the first $1,000
profits."
Cave Vacillates
The first agitation for a salary for
the managing editor was begun last
year by Editor Bob Letts, but action
was delayed until The Daily's by
laws were changed in the new Con
stitution. After the adoption of The
Daily's by-laws this year the matter
was referred to Student Manager
Ben Cave.
Publications Council leaders
claimed that Cave vacillated on the
matter, first admitting he was sup
posed to consider it and then deny
ing it. Yesterday he said: "I remem
ber something about it, but I won't
admit whether you are right oj:
wrong."
Daily Staff Low-Paid
An investigation shows that The
Daily is the only paper on the Coast
that does not pay a salary to its
managing editor.
No definite action on the future
publications structure was taken at
the meeting. At present, the funds of
the different publications will be
kept separate. But in the future, the
members agreed, joint action will
have to be taken.
