# Agreement Reached In Jehol Fight
## Report Agreement After Clash of Troops 
### 
PEIPING, China, Jan. 21 (A > ). â€”
Settlement of the Jehol-Charah bor
der dispute northwest of here was
announced today by Japanese au
thorities after Chinese sources re
ported a clash had occurred between
the Japanese officered troops and the
Charhar provincial force.
The controversy will be continued
in diplomatic negotiations, the Japa
nese announcement indicated, with
regard to exact location of the Chi
nese boundary.
Chinese authorities had frankly
voiced their fears that an invasion
of Charhar, Chinese province, with
massed Japanese and Manchukuan
troops was in prospect. A Japanese
report from Shanghai hastened to
explain, however, that the force was
sent to the border because of Chi
nese incursions.
It was estimated in Kalgan that
3000 Manchukuan and 1000 Japa
nese troops were on the border.
A Tientsin dispatch described the
border situation as "electric," but;
said Sung Chen-Yuan, Charhar pro
vincial chairman, was at Peiping ne
gotiating with the Japanese.
