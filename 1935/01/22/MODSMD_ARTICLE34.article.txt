### Irvin Jorgenson 
Final decision on what hapens to
j The Daily's contested 15 ccnts will
[ probably be made by Ex Committee
! tonight.
The football of many a hectic .ses
sion since it was first considered early
j last quarter, the 15 ccnts is part of
j the 75-cent subscription fee that is
| collected for The Daily from th'!
A.S.S.U.'s $2 fee every quarter.
May Go to A.S.S.U.
Pointing at the surplus The Daily
, has accumulated for the past four
! quarters, an Ex Committee bloc com
posed of Ben Cave, Bill Rogers, and
Dick Stark, with Marvie Kahn as a
silent partner, suggest that the 15
I cents could be better used in the
: A.S.S.U. coffers in case the Theatre is
! built with student body funds.
Pointing at the amount of money
that students arc already paying
i for the theatre, The Daily sup
porters arc promising that the 15
cents can be used for betterment
| of The Daily under the head of edi
torial expense for local pictures
I and fewer advertisements.
The Daily group also points out
that The Daily as well as other cam
pus publications, must look to the
building of new headquarters with
the eventual expansion of the Uni
versity Press.
'Points' Obscure
Now, with all the pointing going
i on, all that is necessary is that both
groups get each other's point.
Other business to be considered in
tonight's meeting is choice of Gran
j tier's successor to Men's Council, and
j the matter, of approving the use of
! "Come Join the Band" on a phono
j graph recording by a San Francisco
i orchestra.
