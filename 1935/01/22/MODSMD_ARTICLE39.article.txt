# Where Should the Money Go?
## 
### 
The question of the Dam.y in service to the
campus vs. the Theatre, two institutions that
now conflict financially although united other
wise, will rise to perturb the Kx Committee
when it meets this evening. For tonight the
matter of whether the Daily's permanent
subscription fee is to be (i() cents or 7"> cents
is expected to he settled.
A small matter, I.V cents, but the question
of whether it is of more value to the pro
posed new Theatre or to the Siaxiomd Daily
has now become a vital issue.
Those who have the interests of the Daily
most at heart believe that the full amount
can be used most effectively to provide the
paper with pictures of local events, necessa
rily more expensive than wire service photos,
with more complete news coverage, with extra
editions (i.e., last week's pledging edition),
and other more expensive mechanical serv
ices.
(dancing through today's paper, the reader
will find three local pictures that could not
be provided without the extra 15 cents. Like
wise important is the matter of a permanent
Daily improvement fund to be used some day
for additional ofliee space, for improved me
chanical equipment, and for additional facili
ties that will enable a growing, developing
paper to meet its lull potentialities.
Every Stanford student now contributes
two dollars per quarter (six dollars each
year) to the Theatre Fund, counting the in
direct t'nion dollar contribution.
The Daily contends that this extra fifteen
cents, mere drop in a live hundred thousand
dollar bucket to the Theatre, is of greater
importance in improving its local service and
in building its own improvement fund for
more permanent benefits.
Kx Committee will decide tonight.
