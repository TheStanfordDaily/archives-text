# Mooney Fights On
## 
### 
Tom Mooney's battle tor freedom is in the
news again; he is very much like a lyan
walking up hill, who persistently slides baek
two steps every time lie takes one stride for
ward. Moonev has again won the court's sym
pathetic pat on the hack, hid not his release.
Technicalities, technicalities, technicalities!
The mills of the judiciary grind slowly in
deed, and the wizened little old radical is
becoming a martyr true enough; if not a
martyr to justice, then one to the melancholy
snail's pace to which justice adheres.
In effect the Supreme Court's decision yes
terday confirmed the prevailing enlightened
opinion that something was rotten in the
procedure which stored the one-time moulder
away in San Quentin for a lifetime. It was
all very sad and deplorable, the court inti
mated. but at the suggestion that it should
oiler some tangible help, it virtually threw up
its hands and pointed mutely to the judicial
system of the sovereign state of California,
the limitless possibilities of which Mooney
has not yet exhausted. The Supreme Court
is, of course, correct. Such is the law.
Such sympathetic words are worthless; in
stitutions and individuals equally imposing
as the Supreme Court have proffered them
before; and still the prisoner drooped in con
finement, withering slowly like the fruit at
the end of a dead bough. The opinions of the
rest of the world have rarely alVected the
sublime course of California jurisprudence.
Tortured by alternate hope and despair, the
prisoner is in himself a sad indictment of
the stolidity of our American system of courts.
Murderer or innocent man, light or wrong,
Mooney was entitled to a swift settlement of
his fate. May be get it, before his life course
has ended.
