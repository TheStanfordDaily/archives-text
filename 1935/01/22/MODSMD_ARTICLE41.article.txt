# Mister Roosevelt's Birthday
## 
### 
Franklin Delano Roosevelt, seleeted hv
one lending magazine as the "Man <>1 the Year"
for 1934, thirty-second president of the I T nitod
Slates, is about to have a birthday.
You and I, and several million other Ameri
cans, have birthdays; bid unless il's John I),
senior or Mahatma himself, nobody reads
about the great event and all is well until the
morning alter.
Roosevelt, savior of his country or sham
"white hope" of the politicians rather than
the people, would probably enjoy the idea of
marking the occasion in much the same
manner.
Rut no. Every commercial organization
Irom hotels and dance pavilions to the na
tion's telegraph agencies join in the plea to
spend one's money on Roosevelt's birthday
in such a manner that the proceeds will go to
the President's favorite charity the Warm
Springs Foundation, a worthy cause.
This country, with or without Roosevelt,
is aiming to rid itself of the lasl vestige of
that weird sector of the business cycle known
as the "depression." With business striving
to gel on its own two feet and still eyeing the
specter of F.D.R. with more than & little
doubt, it does no good whatsoever for the
clever promotion experts to gain good-will for

their own organizations by exploiting the
name Roosevelt for private ends.
If we are going to hit the stage called
"recovery" or "revival" that leads to the long
awaited "prosperity," it must he with lull
co-operation of business and government and
without the idea that this country is in the
hands of a dictator.
The surest way to create the latter situation
is to deify the man Roosevelt, especially be
fore his plans and actions have even started
to accomplish what thev arc claimed to be
capable of doing.
Next, we'll be having a national holiday
on Tom Moonev's birthday.
