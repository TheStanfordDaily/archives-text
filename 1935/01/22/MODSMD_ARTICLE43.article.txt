# LOUISIANA KINGFISH
## 
### JOHN L. KLINE 
Editor's Note—The third of a series on Louisi
ana's pudgy Kingfish attempts to present a few
sidelights on his struggle with finances and the
economic order.)

With Huey loudly expostulating the blessings, mone
tary and otherwise, which his reign has brought to
Louisiana, and his national opponents equally loud in
claiming he has put the state in a financial hole, it io
somewhat difficult to know how the balances stand.
It is generally accepted that the credit of the state is
so far reasonably sound, despite the monkey-business
of Mr. Long and his unorthodox methods. Revenue to
the state has come mainly from a big income tax, sever
ance taxes, a gas tax, and a corporation franchise tax.
This seems to have been almost enough to defray Huey's
road-building, text-buying, Capitol-erecting program.
Ah, say his critics, but you forget how the "capi
tal has flown from the state.H Many claim Standard
Oil is going to move out bag and baggage. Prob
ably Standard's production has been cut down
considerably. But large capital can not be moved
like a hand-organ, it is pretty well "sot." Stand
ard Oil is not likely to desert its Louisiana holdings
completely unless things go to an extreme.
Most Louisianans consider their gains under Huey
more than offset their losses. Of course, many of Long's
supporters are hill-billies who don't think at all, but
can see the visible gains and can hear his extravagant
claims.
Long's finances are of such a juggling, r-ob-Peter-to
pay-Paul type that it is doubtful if they will hold up in
the future as they have in the past. The recent PWA
investigation of how things were run in Louisiana was
a black eye. And Huey's tax-gatherers are becoming
yearly more inefficient. Budget for tax-collectors last
year included items that constituted in some eases 30
to 50 per cent of the total collected. Not even Huey
can make money for long at that rate.
The Senator, of course, can handle figures very
glibly. Why should Louisiana worry about little
finances, when Huey is thinking in terms of billions
for his "Share the Wealth" program? His statistics
for unemployment, pensions, etc., are very good;
they must be, he intimates—-he makes them him
self. Saturday last he talked in terms of 10,000,000
industrial unemployed, 10,100,000 odd farm un
employed, three and a half billion dollars for old
age pensions, two billion dollars for the bonus.
Why bother y ith details?
His Debt Moratorium has consistently been one oI
Huey's strong talking points. He drags it out inces
santly to demonstrate his love for the poverty-stricken
and the hard-pressed. He quotes very impressively
from the Bible as to the holiness of adjusting debt.;
perennially. Similarly, he finds support in Holy Writ
for his "make the big boys have less and split it up"
theories. His reasoning may not be sound, but it has
a wide appeal.
Huey's moratorium bill appealingly provides a $10
minimum to impress the small debtor. But factually,
one must go into virtual bankruptcy to obtain respite.
The catch is that one must "show cause" to the State
Bank Examiner.
In the 44 bills of last November, Huey threw further
sops to the public in the shape of promises of lower
gas and utility rates, abolishment of the poll tax, and
a reduction in the automobile license tax.
One must remember in attempting to judge
Huey that results mean little to a man who can
make himself believed by his constituency as easily
as Huey can. The good points he expands; the bad
ones he covers up—the people think things are
rosy. And. in reality, they probably aren't "fright
ful" in Louisiana —yet, at least.
Amazingly plausible and an excellent rationalizer,
Long can even explain why his dictatorial practices
are necessary. One radio address argued in part:
"They don't like them either . . . You've got to figh'
fire with fire." He holds that you can't say, "This is ii
good law, please pass it," and get anywhere. Unfor
tunately, he's painfully close to the truth.
Tomorrow we try further to discover the tactics
which have been used by this noisy buffoon in elevat
ing himself to the position of most-feared rabble
rouser and most successful exponent of semi-Fascisi
methods in the land.

more than offset their losses. Of course, many of Long's
supporters are hill-billies who don't think at all, but
can see the visible gains and can hear his extravagant
claims.
Long's finances are of such a juggling, r-ob-Peter-to
pay-Paul type that it is doubtful if they will hold up in
the future as they have in the past. The recent PWA
investigation of how things were run in Louisiana was
a black eye. And Huey's tax-gatherers are becoming
yearly more inefficient. Budget for tax-collectors last
year included items that constituted in some eases 30
to 50 per cent of the total collected. Not even Huey
can make money for long at that rate.
The Senator, of course, can handle figures very
glibly. Why should Louisiana worry about little
finances, when Huey is thinking in terms of billions
for his "Share the Wealth" program? His statistics
for unemployment, pensions, etc., are very good;
they must be, he intimates—-he makes them him
self. Saturday last he talked in terms of 10,000,000
industrial unemployed, 10,100,000 odd farm un
employed, three and a half billion dollars for old
age pensions, two billion dollars for the bonus.
Why bother y ith details?
His Debt Moratorium has consistently been one oI
Huey's strong talking points. He drags it out inces
santly to demonstrate his love for the poverty-stricken
and the hard-pressed. He quotes very impressively
from the Bible as to the holiness of adjusting debt.;
perennially. Similarly, he finds support in Holy Writ
for his "make the big boys have less and split it up"
theories. His reasoning may not be sound, but it has
a wide appeal.
Huey's moratorium bill appealingly provides a $10
minimum to impress the small debtor. But factually,
one must go into virtual bankruptcy to obtain respite.
The catch is that one must "show cause" to the State
Bank Examiner.
In the 44 bills of last November, Huey threw further
sops to the public in the shape of promises of lower
gas and utility rates, abolishment of the poll tax, and
a reduction in the automobile license tax.
One must remember in attempting to judge
Huey that results mean little to a man who can
make himself believed by his constituency as easily
as Huey can. The good points he expands; the bad
ones he covers up—the people think things are
rosy. And. in reality, they probably aren't "fright
ful" in Louisiana —yet, at least.
Amazingly plausible and an excellent rationalizer,
Long can even explain why his dictatorial practices
are necessary. One radio address argued in part:
"They don't like them either . . . You've got to figh'
fire with fire." He holds that you can't say, "This is ii
good law, please pass it," and get anywhere. Unfor
tunately, he's painfully close to the truth.
Tomorrow we try further to discover the tactics
which have been used by this noisy buffoon in elevat
ing himself to the position of most-feared rabble
rouser and most successful exponent of semi-Fascisi
methods in the land.

Why bother y ith details?
His Debt Moratorium has consistently been one oI
Huey's strong talking points. He drags it out inces
santly to demonstrate his love for the poverty-stricken
and the hard-pressed. He quotes very impressively
from the Bible as to the holiness of adjusting debt.;
perennially. Similarly, he finds support in Holy Writ
for his "make the big boys have less and split it up"
theories. His reasoning may not be sound, but it has
a wide appeal.
Huey's moratorium bill appealingly provides a $10
minimum to impress the small debtor. But factually,
one must go into virtual bankruptcy to obtain respite.
The catch is that one must "show cause" to the State
Bank Examiner.
In the 44 bills of last November, Huey threw further
sops to the public in the shape of promises of lower
gas and utility rates, abolishment of the poll tax, and
a reduction in the automobile license tax.
One must remember in attempting to judge
Huey that results mean little to a man who can
make himself believed by his constituency as easily
as Huey can. The good points he expands; the bad
ones he covers up—the people think things are
rosy. And. in reality, they probably aren't "fright
ful" in Louisiana —yet, at least.
Amazingly plausible and an excellent rationalizer,
Long can even explain why his dictatorial practices
are necessary. One radio address argued in part:
"They don't like them either . . . You've got to figh'
fire with fire." He holds that you can't say, "This is ii
good law, please pass it," and get anywhere. Unfor
tunately, he's painfully close to the truth.
Tomorrow we try further to discover the tactics
which have been used by this noisy buffoon in elevat
ing himself to the position of most-feared rabble
rouser and most successful exponent of semi-Fascisi
methods in the land.
