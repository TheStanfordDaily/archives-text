BOSTON, Jan. 20.—Over two thousand years ago
King Pyrrhus of Epirus managed to defeat the Romans
in battle. While looking over the enormous number
of casualties he is reputed to have said: "Another vic
tory like this one and we will lose the war." Ever since,
a ruinous victory has been known as a pyrrhic victory.
Last week the Saar voted 10 to 1 for return to
Germany; now it's all over but the shouting. The
Nazis will have three-quarters of a million more citi
zens and the Saarlanders will have—well, what will
they have? They will have national socialism—victory,'
if you want to call it that. And that's about all. Sooner
or later they will realize that it was a pyrrhic victory:
the Saar went back to Germany, but its people lost
their liberties.
Under the League of Nations the Saarlanders
had labor unions. Under Hitler and Thyssen (who
supports him and hates unions) there won't be
any. Taxes will he higher, and there will be less
work sinee Germany already has too much coal—
the life blood of the Saar. These are not the only
things lost.
The League managed to uphold the rights of free
speech, free press, and free assembly during its stay,
all in spite of unlimited Nazi propaganda. Henceforth
no one will <j.ven dare criticize the holy person of the
Reulmleader, the Minister of Propaganda will tell the
papers what they must print, and the Nazi storm troops
will break up nil non-Nazi meetings.
The Saarlanders should worry. Under the magic
spell of millions of marks worth of propaganda they
voted to return to Germany. They can now call them
selves Germans and Nazis. But look what they gav
up in doing it. They won but they lost everything.
