The Editor, Sir:
In the January 17 issue of The
Daily there wag a reference to the
political parties of Canada in the col
umn "Viewing the News." The par
ties were referred to as the Con
servative, Liberal, and Consumers
Co-operative Federation. The cor
rect name of the third party is the
Co-operative Commonwealth Fed
eration, frequently referred to as the
C.C.F.
It might be of interest to point out
that this party has as its aim the
elimination of the profit system and
ihe substitution of a "production for
use" system. The Socialist Party of
Canada is a part of the Federation
but keeps its own organization intact
within the larger organization. In
the Province of British Columbia the
C.C.F. ticket ran a close second to
the Liberals, with the Conservatives
getting few votes, before the Cali
fornia Epic plan was formulated.
However, the party is not strong
throughout Canada by any means.
It diffei's from the California move
ment in that it is not built around
one man and has not a mushroom
growth. It is more nearly like the
Progressive Party in Wisconsin or
the Farmer Labor Party in Minne
sota. Lloyd E. Thomas
