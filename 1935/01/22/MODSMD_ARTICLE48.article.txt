### CEDRIC LARSON 
Leland W. Cutler, president of
| Stanford's Board of Trustees and
< alumnus of the University, has just
j published a volume of reminiscences
| and poetry under the title, "Once
Upon a Time."
Six hundred copies of the work
| were produced by John Henry Nash
j of San Francisco. The book is ex
quisitely bound and engraved, and
i contains 91 pages, 8 by 11 inches.
Memorabilia of Leland Cutler's
associations from the background of
the book, some of whose chapter
headings include: "Portola, A Wood";
"George J. Presley"; "Paul Shoup : ';
"David Starr Jordan"; "San Fran
cisco and Ignatius"; and "The
j Founders of Stanford."
Of Stanford Trustee Paul Shoup,
| the author writes: "I know a man
to whom friendships tome like til
ings to a magnet. Countless work
ers smile at toil because he is their
friend and go to happy homes at
I night with tales of work well done

| . . . The prayer of those whose
privileged step is by his sideâ€”and
the prayer of people he can never
know, is 'May God hold your hand,
Paul Shoup.'
"Countless times I have heard
David Starr Jordan say the words
he loved: "Let the winds of freedom
blow'," Cutler pens of Stanford's
first president, "And because of him,
countless Stanford men and women
| walk the wide ways of the world
1 with those words graven in their
hearts. Doctor Jordan wanted the
winds of freedom to blow."
The author pays tribute to th-3
; founders of Stanford: "And if you
I and I could offer homage to the
founders as they willed, I think we
I would not make of Founders' Day a
' solemn thing but a day of under
standing and of love, for on those
things was Stanford founded and you
j and I can pay no greater tribute to
the founders than to remember they
planned a way for young men and
women to learn to walk in knowl
edge and in self-respect, in beauty
t and in faith."
