# INDIAN CAGE TEAM TO BATTLE WINGED 'O' SQUAD TONIGHT
## Club Record to Date Shows Impressive String Of Victories 
### 
Stung by their 45-31 defeat by the
Golden Bears the Stanford basket
ball quintet will endeavor to come
back tonight when they face the
Olympic Club Cagers in Kezar Pa
vilion at 8 o'clock.
The Indian showing against Cali
fornia did not bring out their full
strength, as their inability to break
and meet th<> ball and their failure to
make free throws enabled the Bears
to run up the score. Whenever the
Cards wanted to score they proved
they could by going through the
Berkeley defense with ease. How
ever, their lack of consistency proved
their downfall.
Coach John Bunn was displeased
with the showing against the Cal
team and feels that the margin of
victory for the Bears was greater
than it should have been. Using a
makeshift line-up on the following
night, Bunn gained a victory over
St. Mary's, although he would
rather have won the previous night.
Tonight the Cards face one of the
toughest teams around the Bay. The
Club boasts of stars such as Hal
Eifert and Joe Kintana, former Cal
men; Ed Lewis, big center from
Oregon, and "Hands" Slavich, former
Santa Clara guard. The Winged 'O'
quintet has won seven games and
dropped three.
Their most impressive and sur
prising win was over the Hutchinson
Renos, 33-30. Other wins were over
the Y.M.1., 45-29, 46-23, and 43-29;
over U.S.F. 34-24, and 41-30; and
over the Athens Club 45-35. The
Club lost to the Universal Pictures
live, who have three all-Americans,
34-27.
Leading 35-31 with but thiee min
utes to go, the Olympic Club fell
before a last-minute onslaught of
California and lost the game, 41-37.
The other loss was to U.S.C., 34-2 G.
It is interesting to note that the
Club fell before both the Trojans and
the Bears, who have also succeeded
in defeating the Cardinals. However,
Bunn is looking over this game to
the two contests with U.C.L.A. in
Los Angeles this week-end. The In
dians will play to win tonight and
have a good chance to score another
victory. Following the Card game
Santa Clara and U.S.F. will tangle.
Bunn will start Arnc Anderson
and Emil Cowing at forward, Keith
Topping at center, and Robin Lind
sey and Wytz Gorter at guard.
Bryan Moore and Carl Schott will
see action, with Don Greenlee get
ting a crack at the center position.

the Y.M.1., 45-29, 46-23, and 43-29;
over U.S.F. 34-24, and 41-30; and
over the Athens Club 45-35. The
Club lost to the Universal Pictures
live, who have three all-Americans,
34-27.
Leading 35-31 with but thiee min
utes to go, the Olympic Club fell
before a last-minute onslaught of
California and lost the game, 41-37.
The other loss was to U.S.C., 34-2 G.
It is interesting to note that the
Club fell before both the Trojans and
the Bears, who have also succeeded
in defeating the Cardinals. However,
Bunn is looking over this game to
the two contests with U.C.L.A. in
Los Angeles this week-end. The In
dians will play to win tonight and
have a good chance to score another
victory. Following the Card game
Santa Clara and U.S.F. will tangle.
Bunn will start Arnc Anderson
and Emil Cowing at forward, Keith
Topping at center, and Robin Lind
sey and Wytz Gorter at guard.
Bryan Moore and Carl Schott will
see action, with Don Greenlee get
ting a crack at the center position.
Stung by their 45-31 defeat by the
Golden Bears the Stanford basket
ball quintet will endeavor to come
back tonight when they face the
Olympic Club Cagers in Kezar Pa
vilion at 8 o'clock.
The Indian showing against Cali
fornia did not bring out their full
strength, as their inability to break
and meet th<> ball and their failure to
make free throws enabled the Bears
to run up the score. Whenever the
Cards wanted to score they proved
they could by going through the
Berkeley defense with ease. How
ever, their lack of consistency proved
their downfall.
Coach John Bunn was displeased
with the showing against the Cal
team and feels that the margin of
victory for the Bears was greater
than it should have been. Using a
makeshift line-up on the following
night, Bunn gained a victory over
St. Mary's, although he would
rather have won the previous night.
Tonight the Cards face one of the
toughest teams around the Bay. The
Club boasts of stars such as Hal
Eifert and Joe Kintana, former Cal
men; Ed Lewis, big center from
Oregon, and "Hands" Slavich, former
Santa Clara guard. The Winged 'O'
quintet has won seven games and
dropped three.
Their most impressive and sur
prising win was over the Hutchinson
Renos, 33-30. Other wins were over
the Y.M.1., 45-29, 46-23, and 43-29;
over U.S.F. 34-24, and 41-30; and
over the Athens Club 45-35. The
