## FAVORING INDIANS is capital Offense 
### 
The next time we hear Stanford
is favored to beat California in bas
ketball we're going to keep our edl
- neck out of the ravages of the
winter season and do nothing what
ever to spread the rumor.
Because it should never he. The
only time Stanford can win basket
garnet* from the Bears is by some
sort of surprise upset; which means
the Indians should never be fa
vored in advance.
Well, maybe once in the next thre?
gamesâ€”
All of which partially serves to
prove the contention that basketball
is the most un-pickable sport on the
athletic program. Any team that is
"hot" and has its collective shooting
eye can win from a quintet that is
much better on paper, if that latter
team happens to be off form. It's
comparable to tennis, or golf, ox
most any of the precision sports.
Football has often been claimed a
nightmare for the pickers, just be -
cause once in a while the teams
don't do right by the scribes. But
when you figure the percentage of
grid games that are chosen in ad
vance, and even how close many of
the actual scores are predicted, it
makes the game much less 1 of a sur
prise than basketball.
