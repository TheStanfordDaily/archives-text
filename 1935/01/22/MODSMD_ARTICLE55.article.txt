# STANDINGS SAME AS LAST YEAR
## 
### 
The standings in both the northern
and southern divisions of the Pa
cific Coast Conference are in much

the same order this season as they
were at the close of the 1934 Basket
ball campaign.
In the southern division. Stan
ford is tied with U-C.L.A. for last
place and Southern California and
California are deadlocked for the
lead: last year, with but two games
remaining, the Bears and Trojans
were in that same deadlock, and
Stanford was but a notch above
the "little Bears,"
Washingturf has again climbed to
the peaks up in the Northwest. The
Huskies' one defeat at the hands of
Idaho was somewhat of a syrprisa,
although the Vandals play the game
"as it should be played," in the re
spectful opinion of Coach John Bunn.
The Vandals are tied with Oregon
and Oregon State for second place.
