# CARDS HAVE CHANCE TO GET BACK UP

### 
Even considering their two de
feats, the Cardinals are not com
pletely out of the race. In fact, they
can join the Bear-Troy first place
combination this week if things go

First of all, Stanford must win
both of her games from U.C.L.A.,
not such a difficult task, but by 110
means easy. Next, California and
U.S.C. must split, which is more
probable than a double victory for
either. That would give each of
the trio three conference victories
and two defeats.
And, although we promised to keep
the neck in, it looks like the In
dians can, and should, win both
Bruin games. —Browne.
