# CO-EDS CLIMB LADDERS, SMEAR PAINT FOR CREDIT
## 
### 
Will Stanford co-eds wear over
alls, and stand shakily atop a 12-
foot ladder with a bucket of paint
in one hand and a brush in the other,
while large smears drop over their
hair?
Yes, says Stage Director George
Andreini. That is, when they are en
rolled in a Theatre Workshop course,
and credited with four units a quar
ter for doing so.
"One of the things they hate most
to do," comments the instructor, "is
climb the grid and stand on the
light bridge in the Assembly Hall."
Explanation: The bridge is a wobbly
structure stretching far above the
stage, with nari'ow foot-room. But
they do it!.
Freshly manicured damsels even
go to the length of mixing calci
mine with their hands.
Men as well as women are eli
gible to take the course. Last quar
ter, football players Nils Larson and

Bob Maentz were to be seen paint
ing delicate designs for wall-paper
on a stage set. This quarter Arne
Anderson and Emil Cowing of bas
ketball fame also are adept at calci
mine-mixing and ladder-mounting.
The class, besides aiding Andreini
with construction of scenery, helps
during dress rehearsals and per
formances with back-stage details.
They provide a crew of assistants for
Andreini, supply groups, and finish
last-minute details in stage setting.
Their latest activity is in connec
tion with "Her Master's Voice," Dra
matic Council production slated tor
presentation early in February. Sev
eral elabtorate scenes ai*e required
for the comedy. The Workshop class
will assemble the thousand and one
props and off-stage noises needed
for the performance, meanwhile ac
quiring knowledge of theatrical
methods under the able George An
dreini.
