GREEN PASTURES
College is rapidly becoming a place
where people with nothing to do con
gregate to do nothing. "Sending the
boy to college" is a convenient and
relatively painless method of getting
rid of a young man who has achieved
the "nuisance" age as far as home is
concerned. Shunted off to the uni
versity, the young man can loose his ;
animal spirits in rooting sections,
dances, and a miscellaneous assort- j
ment of lectures. That educates him
At first, most parents are satisfied
with the education their offspring is
absorbing. Little Johnny—who was
always something of a dolt—can now 1
give the inside dope on one of the i
country's big football teams, can tell
house guests that he is in the Class |
of '00 at Zilch College, and can even j
roll off a few fancy phrases on "social
trends" and "wage scales." Now the
family has something to exhibit.
Johnny comes marching home. And
when he is in school, "Yes, my son is
away at college" is a glowing subject
for neighborhood chit-chat.
After a year or so, tne folks begin
to wonder what is going to happen to
Johnny when college ends: Is Johnny
preparing himself for life? When
they ask the boy, he is ready with
an answer: "I'm getting culture,
mom." That holds the family —at
least for a while.
But it holds Johnny only until his
senior year. Then he begins to realize
what he has known all along—that he
has not prepared himself foj- a job,
and that he is not really cultured
after all. That is usually a most
troublesome conclusion to come to —
especially in Johnny's senior year.
But Johnny goes out into the world,
and takes his Standard Station in
life.
The academic branches of a uni
versity (take Stanford for instance)
try to save their students on the cul
tural score. If they fail, it is becauso
they are alone in a hodge-podge of
yells, athletic clap-trap, and what
not.
Vocational Guidance Committees
of the universities (take Stanford,
for instance) try to save their stu
dents from the unemployed lines. If
they fail, it is because students do
not bother with Vocational Guidance
Committees; or because the world
does not give a damn about Voca
tional Guidance Committee.
