Smoothly .synchronized and speed
ily experienced, the Olympic Club
basketball team flourished in the sec
ond half to win a non-conference
game from Stanford's Indians in the
Civic Auditorium in San Francisco
last night, 50 to 34.
Coach John Bunn's Cardinals led
from time to time in the first half,
until Happy Chambers went in for
Kintana toward the end of the open
ing period. The adept forward started
the ball rolling toward the Winged
'O' basket, and the clubmen claimed
a 22-17 half-time lead which they
never lost.
Expertness in completing of free
throws worked to the Club's ad
vantage in the rough last half; the
Olympics scored on 12 foul shots
during the contest.
Chambers took scoring honors ior
the evening with 13 points. Dinty
Moore, Indian guard, led the Stan
ford forces with eight, followed by
Bill Quade with seven.
Hal Eifert and Englehard, who
played with California last year,
were among the Club scoring lead
ers, accounting for eight and seven
points, respectively.
