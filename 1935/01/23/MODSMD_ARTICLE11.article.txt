# DEBATERS PLAN OVER 40 TILTS
## 
### 
Meeting in verbal clashes with over
40 of the leading colleges and uni
versities in the country, and arguing
pi'o and con on four subjects for a
period of nearly seven weeks, four of
Stanford's best debaters will leave
next Wednesday, January 30, on a
transcontinental tour which is be
lieved to be the most comprehensive
debate tour undertaken by any ma
jor university in many years.
The four men representing Stan
ford, as named by Leland T. Chapin,
debate coach, and Debate Manager
Robert Gros after an extensive study
and a series of tryouts during the fall
quarter, are Fred Bold, Andrew
Bright, Robert Grantier, and Packey
McFarland. These four will divide
into two separate teams, Bright and
Bold touring the mid-continental
and southern route, while Grantier
and McFarland handle the north
east and Atlantic Coast.
Of the four subjects included in the
repertoire of the transcontinental
team, the most controversial and
current is the question, "Resolved:
That this house favors the New
Deal," Stanford denounces by taking
the negative. Other questions being
debated pertain to collective bar
gaining through non-company un
ions, international regulation of mu
nitions shipments, and the question,
"Resolved: That cynicism is a v/ise
view of life." All four men are pre
pared to speak on both sides of all
lout the New Deal question.
Traveling the mid - continental
route to the East, Bold, who is tour
captain and veteran of 45 intercol
legiate debates at Stanford, and
Bright, the star of last fall's: campus
gubernatorial forum, will go to Reno
on January 30, where they meet Ihe
University of Nevada in their first
debate. From there they will go to
Salt Lake City and debate at the
University of Utah, and thence to
Denver, where they will meet the
University of Colorado and Denver
University.
Debates follow in quick succession
with Kansas State and Kansas Uni
versity at Manhattan and Lawrence,
respectively, and with Roekhurst
College at Kansas City, at which
places the New Deal will be assailed
by Bright and Bold. A debate at (he
University of Missouri will be fol
lowed by another with St. Louis
University on February 8.
Other colleges to be visited on this
part of the tour include University
of Chicago, Notre Dame, Purdue,
Cincinnati, Ohio State, University of
Pennsylvania and Temple in Phila
