# SOLAMENTE QUINCE CENTAVOS

(Editorial)
The Daily is poorer by fifteen cents this morning.
('offers of the Associated Students, already swelling into
five figures, now can boast an additional fifteen cents per
quarter from every registered student.
Which is entirely beside the point.

An honest, determined, hard-working Executive Coin-j

with a five-to-four vote leaving in effect the above result.
There can be no question of the integrity and the sin-1
cerity of purpose of the individuals on that body. The |
five that carried the vote honestly feel that the Daily will ,
be able to subsist with a smaller subscription fee.

It is not peculiar that the staff of the Daily should feel

The Daily wants to present a complete coverage of
campus news in words and pictures and at the same time
include outstanding news of the day from metropolitan :
circles.
Without that extra fifteen cents, this policy cannot con-1
tinuc.
The pictures of Stanford people and Stanford places
that the Daily has been publishing recently will bow in
favor of the old-time news photos of Florida bathing beau- j
ties and foreign freaks.
Tin-: Daily seeks progress, not stagnation.
* s|t *
it is unfortunate that the question of giving this fifteen |
cents to the New Theatre rather than to the Daily should j
ever have arisen.
Students are already paying too much toward this
theatre, the drive for which has been backed whole-heart
edly by the Daily for the past three years, the present editor j
not excepted.
Ex Committee, bringing the fifteen cents back into the
fold, will probably not place it directly into the Theatre
Fund, or use it for other student purposes. In all proba
bility, the money would be used to swell the present treas
ury, with the idea that a "down payment" of several thou
sand dollars mav be made when actual construction begins. )
* * *
The issue is simple. Regardless of fifteen cents, Stan
ford must have a Theatre. The seventy-five cent subscrip
tion fee that the Daily receives from each student is mod-!
crate, fair, and divides to about twenty-five cents a month
for a paper five days a week to each student.
A.S.S.U. President Marvie Kahn agrees with the Daily]
staff that the best solution to this entire problem lies in j
taking the Daily's financial support out of the Associated j
Students' funds and in setting up a regular subscription fee,
payable directly from the community fees to the Stanfokdj
Daily.
It is a definite means of settling this situation once and
for all. It is certainly* the answer to the campus need for aj
good paper that would be placed upon its own two feet to
serve the Stanford community in the best possible manner
without interference from well-meaning student politicians
who just do not understand the running of a newspaper.

The issue is simple. Regardless of fifteen cents, Stan
ford must have a Theatre. The seventy-five cent subscrip
tion fee that the Daily receives from each student is mod-!
crate, fair, and divides to about twenty-five cents a month
for a paper five days a week to each student.
A.S.S.U. President Marvie Kahn agrees with the Daily]
staff that the best solution to this entire problem lies in j
taking the Daily's financial support out of the Associated j
Students' funds and in setting up a regular subscription fee,
payable directly from the community fees to the Stanfokdj
Daily.
It is a definite means of settling this situation once and
for all. It is certainly* the answer to the campus need for aj
good paper that would be placed upon its own two feet to
serve the Stanford community in the best possible manner
without interference from well-meaning student politicians
who just do not understand the running of a newspaper.

The Daily is poorer by fifteen cents this morning.

five figures, now can boast an additional fifteen cents per
quarter from every registered student.
Which is entirely beside the point.
