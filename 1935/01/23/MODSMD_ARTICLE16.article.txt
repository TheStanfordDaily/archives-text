### CHARLES THOMAS 
It is a fact unknown to most resi
dents on the Farm, that the United
Stales government has invested over
a quarter of a .million dollars on the
Stanford campus in the form of
equipment and material for the train
ing of future reserve officers of I he
R.O.T.C. It was revealed at the office
of Lieut. Col. D. C. Cubbison, pro
fessor of military science and tactics
in charge of local military training,
that the exact governmental ap
praisal of equipment assigned to this
university totals precisely $.'J()9,144.70.
It was explained that, the Univer
sity signs for all military property,
and the comptroller is the official
custodian of war equipment used
here for instructional purposes. In
addition to this equipment, the Army
maintains a miniature military post
on the campus with five regular
Army officers and a detachment of
20 enlisted men permanently on duty
in the military department.
The most apparent military prop
erty noticed is the stable of 90-odd
well-bred horses, which is located in
the vicinity of the freshman football
field. The horses, valued at over $150
apiece, form an important asset to
local sport activities as well as mili
tary training. Lieut. Haydor Y.
Grubbs, officer in charge of the
stables, has an excellent string of

I polo mounts, which allow the con
tinuation of the popular and highly -
successful sport of polo.
For the field artillery unit, the
army has loaned guns and materiel
enough to equip fully two batteries
of light field artillery.
In the Military Headquarters
Building, behind the Memorial
Church, the R.O.T.C. maintains an
interesting exhibit of artillery and
infantry weapons. The display in
cludes a small tank, which lumbers
out into the open annually 1o ad
vertise the Military Ball, as well as
a complete mobile machine-shop,
called a motor repair truck, which is
used to effect mechanical repairs in
the field. There is also a representa
tive collection of the various types
of rifles and machine guns used by
the American Army.
Col. Cubbison pointed out that all
these guns and equipment are war
surplus, much of which, in the line
of trucks, has become antiquated in
the intervening 18 years. So the
value of military property at Stan
ford does not represent a recent
large government outlay, but is. on
the other hand, extra materiel left :
over from war-time use, which, vil
not used here, would probably be
packed away in some Army war
reserve storehouse.

in the military department.
The most apparent military prop
erty noticed is the stable of 90-odd
well-bred horses, which is located in
the vicinity of the freshman football
field. The horses, valued at over $150
apiece, form an important asset to
local sport activities as well as mili
tary training. Lieut. Haydor Y.
Grubbs, officer in charge of the
stables, has an excellent string of

I polo mounts, which allow the con
tinuation of the popular and highly -
successful sport of polo.
For the field artillery unit, the
army has loaned guns and materiel
enough to equip fully two batteries
of light field artillery.
In the Military Headquarters
Building, behind the Memorial
Church, the R.O.T.C. maintains an
interesting exhibit of artillery and
infantry weapons. The display in
cludes a small tank, which lumbers
out into the open annually 1o ad
vertise the Military Ball, as well as
a complete mobile machine-shop,
called a motor repair truck, which is
used to effect mechanical repairs in
the field. There is also a representa
tive collection of the various types
of rifles and machine guns used by
the American Army.
Col. Cubbison pointed out that all
these guns and equipment are war
surplus, much of which, in the line
of trucks, has become antiquated in
the intervening 18 years. So the
value of military property at Stan
ford does not represent a recent
large government outlay, but is. on
the other hand, extra materiel left :
over from war-time use, which, vil
not used here, would probably be
packed away in some Army war
reserve storehouse.
It is a fact unknown to most resi
dents on the Farm, that the United
Stales government has invested over
a quarter of a .million dollars on the
Stanford campus in the form of
equipment and material for the train
ing of future reserve officers of I he
R.O.T.C. It was revealed at the office
of Lieut. Col. D. C. Cubbison, pro
fessor of military science and tactics
in charge of local military training,
that the exact governmental ap
praisal of equipment assigned to this
university totals precisely $.'J()9,144.70.
It was explained that, the Univer
sity signs for all military property,
and the comptroller is the official
custodian of war equipment used
here for instructional purposes. In
addition to this equipment, the Army
maintains a miniature military post
on the campus with five regular
Army officers and a detachment of
20 enlisted men permanently on duty
in the military department.
