## Members Give Quotations On Various Angles Of New Situation COMPLICATIONS NOTED Some Comment on Possible Effect to Paper 
### 
Various Ex Committee members
| contacted by The Daily last night
j made the following statements con
i cerning their 15-cent cut of the
i Daily's subscription fee.
Helen Ray: "I favor the 15-cent
j Daily reduction, first, because I feel j
j The Daily can function as success
fully and as effectively without it; J
! and, secondly, because I feel that

this money should be returned to the
A.S.S.U. fund where it can again be
used as an emergency subsidy for
other student body activities."
Barbara Holmes: "The Daily made
good use of the money and probably
was entitled to it."
Al Blackmail: "I voted in lfrvor of
The Daily retaining 15 cents of the
regular 75-cent subscription fee, be
cause I believe The Daily has proved
in the last three months that this
15 cents can be advantageously used
to produce a more interesting paper
by the addition of local cuts and the
elimination of fillers."
Vivian Kay: "If it comes to a stu
dent body election I hope that every
one takes the matter seriously and
considers it from all angles. 1 voted
as I felt best."
Mort D'Evelyn: "The 15 cents is
not vital to the New Theatre nor to
the future existence of The Daily.
I do believe that The Daily as a
newspaper does deserve 75 cents per
quarter per student and that the
average student receives more sat
isfaction from The Daily than from
any other portion of the Community
Fee."
Chuck Glasgow: "I absolutely
think that the 15 cents should re
main with The Daily. Continued im
provement of the newspaper is de
cidedly worth while and increased
service to the student body should be
worth the individual's investment of
15 cents.
"An extension and increase in the
circulation of The Daily so that it
will be made to include all faculty
members would be one of the results
of letting the 15 cents remain with
the paper. Also, cuts, as well as the
reporting of local activities and news,
are absolutely essential to the stu
dents."
