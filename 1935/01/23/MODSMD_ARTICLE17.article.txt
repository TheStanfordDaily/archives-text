Various Ex Committee members
| contacted by The Daily last night
j made the following statements con
i cerning their 15-cent cut of the
i Daily's subscription fee.
Helen Ray: "I favor the 15-cent
j Daily reduction, first, because I feel j
j The Daily can function as success
fully and as effectively without it; J
! and, secondly, because I feel that

this money should be returned to the
A.S.S.U. fund where it can again be
used as an emergency subsidy for
other student body activities."
Barbara Holmes: "The Daily made
good use of the money and probably
was entitled to it."
