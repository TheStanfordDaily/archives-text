A.S.S.U. President Marvie
Kahn said last night he favored
separation of The Daily from
direct control by the Ex Com
mittee and the establishment of
a separate organization to con
trol the paper.
"Under the proposed plan The
Daily would be enabled to ex
pand more freely and to become
a real journalistic enterprise,"
he said. "The Daily has as
sumed such proportions that it
really should become inde
pendent. It is unfortunate that
a detached body such as the Ex
Committee has to decide vital
financial issues about a subject
with which they are not too
familiar.
"No matter how conscien
tiously outside persons inves
tigate problems of The Daily,
decentralized financial control
presents the same problems ev
ery year. I believe elimination
of the problems would-be pos
sible if The Daily were an inde
pendent organization."
