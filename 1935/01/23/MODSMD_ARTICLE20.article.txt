## 
### 
There had to be another
member of the Men's Council.
And so the Ex Committee sal
itself down lo make the ap
pointment.
When the chit-chat had sub
sided, and votes were taken,
javelin-tossing Bill Beatty had
cornered four counts, Bob Gros
three, and Carl Boss three.
That satisfied everyone—the
job was done.
But after the meeting had ad
journed, someone discovered
that only nine members had
attended the meeting, ten votes
were cast. That was rectified
when Marvie Kahn withdrew
the vote he had inadvertently
cast for Ross (student body
president votes only in case of
a tie).
Now the matter was ended.
Until someone discovered that
Beatty was minus 25 in the
Bawl Out. That was rectified
when Beatty said the Bawl Out
had erred, he was really plus
40.
Now the matter is ended. Un
til the February elections, when
Beatty's temporary appointment
lapses.
There had to be another
