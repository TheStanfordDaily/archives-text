# WILBUR LETTER FAVORS THEATRE
## President Says Surplus Of Daily Less Important 
### 
Mr. Marvin Kahn,
i President, Associated Students
(Chairman of Executive Committee)
Stanford University
Dear Mr. Kahn:
The question you present in your
letter of January 16th, regarding the
further continuance of the grant of
an extra 15 cents made to the Stan
; ford Daily last quarter, brings up
J sharply a matter of policy. The As
sociated Students by an overwhelm
j ing vote have decided to make in
dividual contributions over a period
oi years for the construction of a new
j auditorium or theatre. This is the
( most important new project before
I the students and the University at
present. It will require every pos
sible source of revenue in order to
make its construction possible at
j this time. The larger the sum that
can be provided annually, the short
' er the period during which the addi -
tional dollar charge will be made
, against every registered student. I
i think that the students still under
stand that there is only so much
money and that careful choices must
be made as to how it is to be spent.
We have the same problem in the
i University. Whenever we want to
organize a new department or add a
! new professor we have to concen
i trate out financial resources in that
i direction and, while maintaining ex
j isting departments at a satisfactory
i level, add just as much financial
strength as we can to the new ven
ture. No substantial advance can be
i made without drawing in resources
j from other interests or delaying ad
j vances in other parts of the Uni
| versity.
It seems to me that the problem to
jbe decided is simple. The Stanford
Daily is the official organ of the
Associated Students. It has an as
sured subscription list and prac
! tically assured financing over a pe-
I riod of years. It is slowly developing
! a surplus. Is it desirable for it to
I continue to develop such a surplus
rather than to give additional sums
I to the new Stanford auditorium (the
atre) project? You and your fellow
officers in the Associated Students
must determine that question of pol
: icy. Personally, I would consider the
| new theatre project more important
! than building up a reserve fund in t
i well established official paper be
' longing to the Associated Students.
Very sincerely yours,
Pay Lyman Wilbur,

Dear Mr. Kahn:
The question you present in your
letter of January 16th, regarding the
further continuance of the grant of
an extra 15 cents made to the Stan
; ford Daily last quarter, brings up
J sharply a matter of policy. The As
sociated Students by an overwhelm
j ing vote have decided to make in
dividual contributions over a period
oi years for the construction of a new
j auditorium or theatre. This is the
( most important new project before
I the students and the University at
present. It will require every pos
sible source of revenue in order to
make its construction possible at
j this time. The larger the sum that
can be provided annually, the short
' er the period during which the addi -
tional dollar charge will be made
, against every registered student. I
i think that the students still under
stand that there is only so much
money and that careful choices must
be made as to how it is to be spent.
We have the same problem in the
i University. Whenever we want to
organize a new department or add a
! new professor we have to concen
i trate out financial resources in that
i direction and, while maintaining ex
j isting departments at a satisfactory
i level, add just as much financial
strength as we can to the new ven
ture. No substantial advance can be
i made without drawing in resources
j from other interests or delaying ad
j vances in other parts of the Uni
| versity.
It seems to me that the problem to
jbe decided is simple. The Stanford
Daily is the official organ of the
Associated Students. It has an as
sured subscription list and prac
! tically assured financing over a pe-
I riod of years. It is slowly developing
! a surplus. Is it desirable for it to
I continue to develop such a surplus
rather than to give additional sums
I to the new Stanford auditorium (the
atre) project? You and your fellow
officers in the Associated Students
must determine that question of pol
: icy. Personally, I would consider the
| new theatre project more important
! than building up a reserve fund in t
i well established official paper be
' longing to the Associated Students.
Very sincerely yours,
Pay Lyman Wilbur,
President
