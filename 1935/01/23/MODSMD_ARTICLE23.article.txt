# Final Vote of 5-4 Cuts Daily Subscription Fee From 75 to 60 Cents
## STUDENTS MAY VOTE Contested Money May Aid Theatre Fund Eventually 
### Irvin Jorgensen 
By a vote of five to four last night,
the Executive Committee cut The
Daily subscription fee from 75 cents
to 60 cents per quarter. The 15 cents
pared from the fee will revert to the
Students' Organization Fund of the
A.S.S.U.
Dissatisfied with the results of Ex
Committee's vote, Daily supporters
are now circulating a petition that a
student vote be called so that the
student body can express its opinion
on the matter.
Cave Asks Money
Hanging fire for over two months,
The Daily 15 cents first felt the heavy
hand of Ex Committee the middle of
last quarter, when Student Manager
Ben Cave began looking around for
means of financing the New Theatre.
At that time, it was agreed by Ex
Committee that the contested 15
cents should be placed in the hands
of the editorial board for use in in
creasing the size of the paper when
necessary and for pictures of campus
personalities and events. Since that
decision The Daily has been showing
what it can do with the 15 cents
editorially.
Arguing for the retention of the
15 cents, which was added to The
Daily several years ago when the
depression had cut materially into
Daily funds, Business Manager
Bob Herman, Editor Stan Beau
baire, Ex Committeemen Chuck
Glasgow, Mort D'Evelvn, and Al
Blackman contended the fee
has remained vital to The Paily
sincc the revival of business, and
Daily profits.
They said that a building for the
housing of campus publications will
soon become necessary, that The
Daily needs the 15 cents to assure
erection of this structure, that The
Daily needs the 15 cents for the
general editorial improvement of ihe
paper with local pictures and reduc
tion of superfluous advertising fill
ers, and that The Daily needs it to
provide financial stability.
To Lose Money
Bill Stark, Sammy Lee, Bill Rog
ers, and Helen Ray countered that if
a press building is necessary the Ex
Committee would back the publica
(Continued from page 1)
tions, just as it is trying to back the
theatre; and that sufficient editorial
coverage could be obtained by using
The Daily profits.
That there would not be any prof
its without the full fee was gloomily
prophesied by Manager Herman, who
pointed to his budget. The budget
showed that without the 15 cents,
The Daily stands to lose $600 be
tween January 1 and the end of the
school year.
Already weary of debating Daily
business, the committee was brought
to consider the question of a salary
for the managing editor of Stanford's
legislative football by Publications
Council's recommendation that he he
given a monthly salary of $20.
$75 Voted
This much was agreed to by Ex
Committee. But fearful of getting
lost in another rhetorcial bramble
bush, the committee postponed for
future meetings consideration of The
Daily managing editor's share in the
profits that Herman claims may nev
er again be seen on the face of the
earth, and the managing editor's
light to be nominated for editor.
Seventy-five dollars was voted by
Ex Committee to be spent for parts
on the Ex Committee's white ele
phantine public address system in an
eflort to "rejuvenate" it.
The right to use "Come Join the
Band" on a phonograph recording by
Dick Jurgens was sanctioned.
Dates were granted for a Newman
Club jolly-up on January 29, a Delta
Kappa Epsilon open house on Men's
Pledge Night, the Encina Spring In
formal on May 3, and the Cardinal
Masque Ball on April 26.
Helen Ray, chairman of the date
granting committee, requested that
students applying for dates in which
the women's gym will be used get
permission from authorities in the
women's gym before asking for the
date.
