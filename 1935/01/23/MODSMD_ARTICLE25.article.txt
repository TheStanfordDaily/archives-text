Students and trackmen who remember the

Control regarding participation in tlie 1.C.4-A.
meet the past few years are wondering, now
that the track season is just around the cor
ner, whether we are going to be inflicted with
a repetition dl the same farce again.
Certainly, Stanford, as defending cham
pions in both the I.C.A.A.A.A. and N.C.A.A.
competition, should be represented some
where: the proximity of the latter meet to
finals week proscribes it; and the prestige
attending the Eastern show, with ancient
Yale, Pennsylvania, Harvard, and others as
rivals, makes it the best bet.
Last spring, the B.A.C. emphatically de
nounced the advisability of Stanford's at
tendance at the 1.C.A.A.A.A., and promised
that 1934 would be our Ia s I appearance there.
The unrefutable fact remains that Stanford
coaches and athletes want participation;
teams at the meet represent only the finest
scholastic, as well as athletic, institutions;
competition is by invitation only; sportsmen
consider it the major American meet; and the
accompanying favorable publicity is alone
worth the price of the trip.
True, the decision might be understood as
closed, with no opportunity of our entrance.
However, the Stanford successes subsequent
to the H.A.C. ultimatum of last May should
lead the board to reconsider and perhaps to
amend their stand.
"'lie Indian squad has a right to know in
advance if, or if not, they are going. The
Hoard of Athletic Control should determine
its stand at the earliest moment, and deter
mine it with some linalitv.
