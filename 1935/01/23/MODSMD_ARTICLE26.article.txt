# What Happened in San Francisco?
## 
### 
J>isc*iissi a highly controversial and much
publicized subject last summer's San Fran
cisco strikeâ€” the Walrus Club will attempt
tomorrow night to get at the root of the causes
of the general walkout that captured the na
tion's headlines some six months ago.
Dwight L. Palmer and William S. Hopkins,
members of the technical stall" of the National
Longshoremen's Board, will give a wcll-au-
Ibentieated background approach and then
the meeting will be thrown open to discussion
from the lloor. As usual, anyone is welcome
to attend. ,
With rumors floating around that the San
Francisco strike was not settled bill only post
poned and that trouble of a more serious na
ture may crop up again, it is vital that intelli
gent discussion lake place as to the causes and
means of settlement of last summer's dilTi
culties.
The phenomenon of industrial warfare is
not a new problem and not a peculiarly local
problem but it is of grave significance, politi
cally, economically, and socially. If the Wal
rus (Hub can throw any light on the subject,
more power to them. The members of the
(Jub must at least be credited with a worth
while attempt to keep aglow the dying embers
of intellectual discussion on the Farm.
