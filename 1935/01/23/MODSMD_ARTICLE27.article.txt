Campus theatregoers are still talking about
I lie u 11 u sua I sueeess of the November Big Game
Gaieties, and many have suggested to the
Daily that plans be laid to feature a student
written musieal production during spring
quarter.

the antiquated Assembly Hall is sold out to
standing room for a well-publicized Gaieties.
II remains for campus dramatic organiza
tions, perhaps Ham's Head with its successful
experience of last quarter, to form concrete
plans for a spring musieal that will give cam
pus talent the opportunity to express itself
with new music, new lyrics, new gags, and the
gay, carefree acting of a jolly musical pro
duction.
