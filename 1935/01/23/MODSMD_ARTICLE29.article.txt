# LOUISIANA KINGFISH

### JOHN L. KLINE 
(Editor's Note: This, the last of a series of
article on Huey P. Long, blustering senator, pre
sents a brief analysis of his methods, appeal, ambi
tions, and future possibilities.)
". . . My choice (for Man of the Year) is Huey P.
Long because:
"lie believes in the 'inalienable rights' not only
for the chosen few, hut for all.
"He has the courage to fight to the bitter end for
bis convictions and for the underprivileged.
"His collection of enemies is the best guarantee
that he is not for sale.
"His past achievements against overwhelming
odds furnish ample proof of his ability and his
courage . .
Thus writes a Time-reader from Ohio. It demon
strates forcefully how Huey's supporters place him on
a pedestal, how neatly the wool is over their eyes.
How does a self-seeking man make himself appear so
altruistic? Many have done it before; demagogues are
not a novelty, especially in the South. But Huey bows
to none in this ability. How does he get by with it?
First and foremost, he is a smart man—clever and
intelligent. Such a man can go far if he conveniently
lacks both orthodoxy and bothersome scruples. Let no
one fool you, Huey can be called many things—has
been, in fact—but the word "ignorant" does not apply
to him. When Huey was a young lawyer he got fees
up to $100,000 for a single case, and won commendation
on his ability from the late Chief Justice Taft and
Justice Brandeis. He is nobody's fool.
Secondly, he hides this agile mind behind a comic
exterior. One resents a buffoon, perhaps, but it is hard
to become seriously angry with one. While the public
laughed at him, Long took away the civil liberties of
his state's citizens, and instituted his secret police,
trained courts, militia, and election machinery. More
over, his antics are good vote-getters. Crowds come
curious and go home to vote for Huey. When a crowd
is assembled, Huey is never at a loss for convincing
words.
Louisiana elections have been a source of na
tional amusement ever since the memorable day
when St. Bernard and Jefferson parishes returned
more votes for Huey than the total number of
negro and white adults in the district. Some have
come to take him more seriously since, however.
Laughing at the opposition, always an effective de
vice, has always been a Long custom. So has the brush
ing aside of setbacks as though they were minor annoy
ance. His handling of the embarrassing situation caused
by the failure of football star state senator Mickal to
take his seat, was adroitly handled by giving him a
"five-day leave" for a five-day session.
Apparent open-facedness is another popular attri
bute of the calculating Huey; hypocrisy and secrecy
are seldom favored, and he pretends to avoid them.
"I don't want the governor to have any power we can
take away from him," he told his legislators.
Long is expert at adapting almost anything to
his personal lust for autocratic power. From Plato
(and. more recently, Mussolini) comes his concept
of rule for the people, but not by them. From a
long line of thinkers come his ideas of limitation of
incomes and property ownership.
Chief weakness in Huey's thick armor is his con
ceited blatancy. Like the late-defeated Mr. Sinclair
he gives his enemies too much ammunition to turn
against him. Such statements as "We're not a-studying
about that damn Washington government; that's the
least of our worries"; and "Louisiana is big enough for
me; I don't know nothing about the other states" wiil
be a handicap if he ever runs for President.
If business is ever driven to the extremity of
Fascism to crush labor, some think Long would be
the man to head the movement. But with his chances of
peaceable election already compromised, he would have
to attempt a military coup, for the success of which
the U.S. is considered too big, too heterogeneous, and
too conservative.
Long has depended on near-radicalship and his
vague "Share the Wealth" program too long to get
the large conservative following necessary to win
a presidential race. Huey's only chance is that
economic conditions hit a new low which few now
foresee. If things get really bad, he'll be king-pin;
if they improve much more he'll he a dead kingfish.
To beat Long in Louisiana—as many would like to
do—a first-class leader of the Senator Glass type must
be found—highly popular, having a spotless record, and
lots of intestinal fortitude. Glass, incidentally, is the
only man who has ever thoroughly squelched Huey.
Once, after Glass whispered into his ear while he was
speaking in the Senate, Huey blanched, sat down, and
soon left the chamber.
There you have him—Huey P. Long, senator,
demagogue, dictator, self-seeker: climbing, may
be: slipping—perhaps.

take away from him," he told his legislators.
Long is expert at adapting almost anything to
his personal lust for autocratic power. From Plato
(and. more recently, Mussolini) comes his concept
of rule for the people, but not by them. From a
long line of thinkers come his ideas of limitation of
incomes and property ownership.
Chief weakness in Huey's thick armor is his con
ceited blatancy. Like the late-defeated Mr. Sinclair
he gives his enemies too much ammunition to turn
against him. Such statements as "We're not a-studying
about that damn Washington government; that's the
least of our worries"; and "Louisiana is big enough for
me; I don't know nothing about the other states" wiil
be a handicap if he ever runs for President.
If business is ever driven to the extremity of
Fascism to crush labor, some think Long would be
the man to head the movement. But with his chances of
peaceable election already compromised, he would have
to attempt a military coup, for the success of which
the U.S. is considered too big, too heterogeneous, and
too conservative.
Long has depended on near-radicalship and his
vague "Share the Wealth" program too long to get
the large conservative following necessary to win
a presidential race. Huey's only chance is that
economic conditions hit a new low which few now
foresee. If things get really bad, he'll be king-pin;
if they improve much more he'll he a dead kingfish.
To beat Long in Louisiana—as many would like to
do—a first-class leader of the Senator Glass type must
be found—highly popular, having a spotless record, and
lots of intestinal fortitude. Glass, incidentally, is the
only man who has ever thoroughly squelched Huey.
Once, after Glass whispered into his ear while he was
speaking in the Senate, Huey blanched, sat down, and
soon left the chamber.
There you have him—Huey P. Long, senator,
demagogue, dictator, self-seeker: climbing, may
be: slipping—perhaps.
(Editor's Note: This, the last of a series of
article on Huey P. Long, blustering senator, pre
sents a brief analysis of his methods, appeal, ambi
tions, and future possibilities.)
". . . My choice (for Man of the Year) is Huey P.
Long because:
"lie believes in the 'inalienable rights' not only
for the chosen few, hut for all.
"He has the courage to fight to the bitter end for
bis convictions and for the underprivileged.
"His collection of enemies is the best guarantee
that he is not for sale.
"His past achievements against overwhelming
odds furnish ample proof of his ability and his
courage . .
Thus writes a Time-reader from Ohio. It demon
strates forcefully how Huey's supporters place him on
a pedestal, how neatly the wool is over their eyes.
How does a self-seeking man make himself appear so
altruistic? Many have done it before; demagogues are
not a novelty, especially in the South. But Huey bows
to none in this ability. How does he get by with it?
First and foremost, he is a smart man—clever and
intelligent. Such a man can go far if he conveniently
lacks both orthodoxy and bothersome scruples. Let no
one fool you, Huey can be called many things—has
been, in fact—but the word "ignorant" does not apply
to him. When Huey was a young lawyer he got fees
up to $100,000 for a single case, and won commendation
on his ability from the late Chief Justice Taft and
Justice Brandeis. He is nobody's fool.
Secondly, he hides this agile mind behind a comic
exterior. One resents a buffoon, perhaps, but it is hard
to become seriously angry with one. While the public
laughed at him, Long took away the civil liberties of
his state's citizens, and instituted his secret police,
trained courts, militia, and election machinery. More
over, his antics are good vote-getters. Crowds come
curious and go home to vote for Huey. When a crowd
is assembled, Huey is never at a loss for convincing
words.
Louisiana elections have been a source of na
tional amusement ever since the memorable day
when St. Bernard and Jefferson parishes returned
more votes for Huey than the total number of
negro and white adults in the district. Some have
come to take him more seriously since, however.
Laughing at the opposition, always an effective de
vice, has always been a Long custom. So has the brush
ing aside of setbacks as though they were minor annoy
ance. His handling of the embarrassing situation caused
by the failure of football star state senator Mickal to
take his seat, was adroitly handled by giving him a
"five-day leave" for a five-day session.
Apparent open-facedness is another popular attri
bute of the calculating Huey; hypocrisy and secrecy
are seldom favored, and he pretends to avoid them.

altruistic? Many have done it before; demagogues are
not a novelty, especially in the South. But Huey bows
to none in this ability. How does he get by with it?
First and foremost, he is a smart man—clever and
intelligent. Such a man can go far if he conveniently
lacks both orthodoxy and bothersome scruples. Let no
one fool you, Huey can be called many things—has
been, in fact—but the word "ignorant" does not apply
to him. When Huey was a young lawyer he got fees
up to $100,000 for a single case, and won commendation
on his ability from the late Chief Justice Taft and
Justice Brandeis. He is nobody's fool.
Secondly, he hides this agile mind behind a comic
exterior. One resents a buffoon, perhaps, but it is hard
to become seriously angry with one. While the public
laughed at him, Long took away the civil liberties of
his state's citizens, and instituted his secret police,
trained courts, militia, and election machinery. More
over, his antics are good vote-getters. Crowds come
curious and go home to vote for Huey. When a crowd
is assembled, Huey is never at a loss for convincing
words.
Louisiana elections have been a source of na
tional amusement ever since the memorable day
when St. Bernard and Jefferson parishes returned
more votes for Huey than the total number of
negro and white adults in the district. Some have
come to take him more seriously since, however.
Laughing at the opposition, always an effective de
vice, has always been a Long custom. So has the brush
ing aside of setbacks as though they were minor annoy
ance. His handling of the embarrassing situation caused
by the failure of football star state senator Mickal to
take his seat, was adroitly handled by giving him a
"five-day leave" for a five-day session.
Apparent open-facedness is another popular attri
bute of the calculating Huey; hypocrisy and secrecy
are seldom favored, and he pretends to avoid them.
"I don't want the governor to have any power we can
take away from him," he told his legislators.
Long is expert at adapting almost anything to
his personal lust for autocratic power. From Plato
(and. more recently, Mussolini) comes his concept
of rule for the people, but not by them. From a
long line of thinkers come his ideas of limitation of
incomes and property ownership.
Chief weakness in Huey's thick armor is his con
ceited blatancy. Like the late-defeated Mr. Sinclair
he gives his enemies too much ammunition to turn
against him. Such statements as "We're not a-studying
about that damn Washington government; that's the
least of our worries"; and "Louisiana is big enough for
me; I don't know nothing about the other states" wiil
be a handicap if he ever runs for President.
If business is ever driven to the extremity of
Fascism to crush labor, some think Long would be
the man to head the movement. But with his chances of
peaceable election already compromised, he would have
to attempt a military coup, for the success of which
the U.S. is considered too big, too heterogeneous, and
too conservative.
Long has depended on near-radicalship and his
vague "Share the Wealth" program too long to get
the large conservative following necessary to win
a presidential race. Huey's only chance is that
economic conditions hit a new low which few now
foresee. If things get really bad, he'll be king-pin;
if they improve much more he'll he a dead kingfish.
To beat Long in Louisiana—as many would like to
do—a first-class leader of the Senator Glass type must
be found—highly popular, having a spotless record, and
lots of intestinal fortitude. Glass, incidentally, is the
only man who has ever thoroughly squelched Huey.
Once, after Glass whispered into his ear while he was
speaking in the Senate, Huey blanched, sat down, and
soon left the chamber.
There you have him—Huey P. Long, senator,
demagogue, dictator, self-seeker: climbing, may
be: slipping—perhaps.
(Editor's Note: This, the last of a series of
article on Huey P. Long, blustering senator, pre
sents a brief analysis of his methods, appeal, ambi
tions, and future possibilities.)
". . . My choice (for Man of the Year) is Huey P.
Long because:
"lie believes in the 'inalienable rights' not only
for the chosen few, hut for all.
"He has the courage to fight to the bitter end for
bis convictions and for the underprivileged.
"His collection of enemies is the best guarantee
that he is not for sale.
"His past achievements against overwhelming
odds furnish ample proof of his ability and his
courage . .
Thus writes a Time-reader from Ohio. It demon
strates forcefully how Huey's supporters place him on
a pedestal, how neatly the wool is over their eyes.
