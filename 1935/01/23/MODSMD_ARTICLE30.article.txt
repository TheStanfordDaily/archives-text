Last month Frederick Rand Rogers, one-time Stan
ford student who spent his spare time on the Farm in
random physical education activities, shocked a group
of college representatives gathered at Boston. He the
orized at some length on the admirable qualities of
good sportsmanship and wound up by saying that in -ill
athletic competition tie scores should be the rule; no
one should ever win.
"Keeping a stout heart in defeat and pride in victory
is a lot of sentiment," Rogers said. The man who mads
this statement is dean of physical education at Boston
University.
Harry Maloney, director of minor sports and for
27 years trainer 01* coach of Cardinal teams, remembers
the theorizing Fred Rogers very well and describes him
as "a man whose brain is too far ahead of his body
from the standpoint of experience."
Maloney thinks the "all ties" theory is of the es
sence of acrid grapes. "Winning is important. Not if
or whether you win, but how you win," he says. "True
sportsmanship consists of winning graciously and losing
without regrets, and not, as Rogers says, of recognizing
the opponents' equality by declaring a draw at the
end of the game."
Without the possibility of winning, the incentive
would be wholly lacking and a lackadaisical spirit would
pervade athletics that, would make sport about as
popular as courses in higher philosophy. Even in intra
mural athletics, so highly organized on the Farm, keen
competition is necessary. Maloney illustrates this by
saying:
"If the Pie Bitas beat the Kappa Zis in intra-mural
handball, a Kappa Zi man isn't going to look with
disdain on a Pie Bita simply because he has vanquished
him. He will respect him all the more for having
proven his superiority."
Radical Mr. Rogers thinks "the essence of sport is
enjoyment, not winning. That players learn from in
structors, not from competition. The athletic ability de
pends 50 per cent on brute strength and the rest 011
'other qualities.' That there is no reason for pride
following a victory. That it is merely to protect your
own ego that you want to win."
Harry Maloney, who sat behind the desk when
Rogers sat in the classroom, thinks none of this.
"Whether a young man is in athletics, the literary
field, dramatics or any other like field, he tries to giv â€¢
what is best and get just as much out as he puts in.
He carries the stamina, resistance, and competitive
spirit thus learned out into the business world."
