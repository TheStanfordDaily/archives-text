# BULL SESSION
## REDS INVADE STANFORD 
### 
Safely cloistered behind the guardian virgins on the Sandstone Gate?,
Sianford students have felt themselves secure against the social turmoil
of the outside world. There might be suffering and oppression on the
other side of the highway, but none at Stanford. There might be Com
munism and Red propaganda anywhere eke, but none at Stanford. That
has always been reassuring.

But Stanford's sanctity has at last been violated. Mr. Hearst w;is right.
The tenacles of Moscow have reached out to encircle the Farm. "First the
Russian Ambassador is received here: that causes not a few shudders.

Soviet literature is discovered in the
Hoover War Library: thqt is a bit
horrifying. Yet these are mere trifles
compared with the announcement in
today's Daily.
"Sword and Sandals" (which itself
sounds rather revolutionary) has de
cided to present ihe Soviet propaganda
play, "Fear." Written by one of those
Russians — Alexander Afinogenyev —
"Fear" proves that nothing, not even
science, can be detached from the
class struggle. It reeks with the call
to arms and Marxian dialectic mate
rialism. Stanford had better beware.
If "Fear" were the only play to
present, there might be some excuse
for it. But in trying to slip one ol
these foreign things off on the campus,
Sword and Sandals has passed over
many of the major American, classics.
A wholesome drama like "Bertha, the
Sewing Machine Girl" they do not
consider. The epic, "Jim, the Pen-

man"—that gem which inspires one to the better life—these esthetes sneer
at. And the play of them all, "The Triumph at Plattsburgh," dipped in the
blood of patriots, draws not even passing notice.

Instead of honest American names like "Smith" and "Jones." there
will echo from the platform of the Little Theatre the evil-sounding
Ilyitches, Kasyanovitches, and Kostalskies. On the fatal day when "Fear"
takes the Stanford stage, the Russian bear —not the brave American eagle
—will be enshrined on the Farm. That is pure.decadence.
And Stanford alone is not underminded. "Fear" has just been pre
sented at Syracuse University—which Mr. Hearst'has just proven to be
a hotbed of Communism. The obvious implication is that the Moscow
propaganda machine has established a Red network —dripping with perfidy
and ruin.
What is to become of Stanford? O tempora, a mores! I

Russian Ambassador is received here: that causes not a few shudders.

Soviet literature is discovered in the
Hoover War Library: thqt is a bit
horrifying. Yet these are mere trifles
compared with the announcement in
today's Daily.
"Sword and Sandals" (which itself
sounds rather revolutionary) has de
cided to present ihe Soviet propaganda
play, "Fear." Written by one of those
Russians — Alexander Afinogenyev —
"Fear" proves that nothing, not even
science, can be detached from the
class struggle. It reeks with the call
to arms and Marxian dialectic mate
rialism. Stanford had better beware.
If "Fear" were the only play to
present, there might be some excuse
for it. But in trying to slip one ol
these foreign things off on the campus,
Sword and Sandals has passed over
many of the major American, classics.
A wholesome drama like "Bertha, the
Sewing Machine Girl" they do not
consider. The epic, "Jim, the Pen-

man"—that gem which inspires one to the better life—these esthetes sneer
at. And the play of them all, "The Triumph at Plattsburgh," dipped in the
blood of patriots, draws not even passing notice.

Instead of honest American names like "Smith" and "Jones." there
will echo from the platform of the Little Theatre the evil-sounding
Ilyitches, Kasyanovitches, and Kostalskies. On the fatal day when "Fear"
takes the Stanford stage, the Russian bear —not the brave American eagle
—will be enshrined on the Farm. That is pure.decadence.
And Stanford alone is not underminded. "Fear" has just been pre
sented at Syracuse University—which Mr. Hearst'has just proven to be
a hotbed of Communism. The obvious implication is that the Moscow
propaganda machine has established a Red network —dripping with perfidy
and ruin.
What is to become of Stanford? O tempora, a mores! I

Safely cloistered behind the guardian virgins on the Sandstone Gate?,
Sianford students have felt themselves secure against the social turmoil
of the outside world. There might be suffering and oppression on the
other side of the highway, but none at Stanford. There might be Com
munism and Red propaganda anywhere eke, but none at Stanford. That
has always been reassuring.

But Stanford's sanctity has at last been violated. Mr. Hearst w;is right.
The tenacles of Moscow have reached out to encircle the Farm. "First the
