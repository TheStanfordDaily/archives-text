KID MILLIONS"
At Blanco's Theatre (Mt. View)
There is too much Cantor in this
film. Cantor that is becoming too
familiar to be funny. Eddie is pull
ing the same gags and doing the same
pantomimic stunts that made him
famous a generation ago. The plot,

having to do
with a New York
news boy's in
heritance of a
fortune in
and subsequent
ly getting in
volved with
sheiks and heirs.

is as silly as usual. It climaxes in an
ice cream factory color fantasy
which is remindful of Disney's Silly
Symphonies, but isn't nearly so ef
fective. "O.K. Toots" and "An Ear
ful of Music" are two tuneful songs
from the show, but they fail to sup
port ,the rest of the "drama."
