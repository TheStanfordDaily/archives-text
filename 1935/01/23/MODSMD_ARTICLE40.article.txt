### 
WASHINGTON. Jan. 22 (A 3 ). â€”
President Roosevelt today asked the
Labor Relations Board to refrain
from considering labor disputes
arising in industrial boards to con
sider them.
Earlier, Howard Davis, chairman
of the publishers' code committee,
revoked the call for a convention of
daily newspaper publishers due to a
"satisfactory adjustment of the dif
ferences which necessitated the call."
