# FROSH TRACKMEN SHOW STRENGTH IN ALL FIELD EVENTS
## 
### Gordon Frost 
Most every year some authority is
willing to concede Stanford's frosh |
track team the honor of having the
"brightest prospects in yeais." This
season that statement comes pretty
close to actual fact, but the conserva
tive prediction is that Stanford has a
fine all-around squad of frosh track
aspirants with considerable strength
in every event, and few weak spots.
Topping the list of prospective
shining lights is Jim Kneubuhl, from
the Samoan Islands, who has done
the hundred in 9:8 and the 220 in
2:15. Backing Kneubuhl in the
sprints are Alden Ames and John
Pauly, who have been turning in
good times for the dashes.
Kneubuhl Leads Sprints
In the 440 Knuebuhl has been
clocked at 49 flat and he with the
help of Jim Coonan, Guy Hagerty,
Hubert Jones, and Chuck Carruth
ers should be able to take care of
that event in good style. Hagerty is
also the best 880 prospect yet to ap
pear.
The longer runs will be ably taken
care of by Etson Burroughs, who has
done the mile in 4:30, Otto Donnell.
and John Dern.
Four Hurdle Prospects
Cy Oberg, Art Finucane, and Ken
Peters are vieing for hurdle honors
and with the help of Bob Zonne, who
will be occupied with basketball un
til. later in the season, should be able
to hold down the hurdle post in good
fashion.
Hank Luisetti, another frosh hoop
ster, clears the high jump bar at 3
feet 2 inches and with Zonne, El
wood Carlson, and Alden Ames,
should carry high jump honors.
" Broad jump and pole vault will be
I taken care of by Bill Daugherty, Leo
j Madlem, Joseph Gill, arid Tom Col-
I lins. Madlem broad jumps 23 feet
j 8 inches and Collins and Daugherty
j have leaps of 22 feet 6 and

21 feet 6 inches, respectively. Gill
has been showing best in the pole
vault.
Weights are covered by Glenn
Hamilton, who puts the shot 45 feet,
and Grant Stone, Kneubuhl, John
Partridge, and Bill Roberts are some
of the best javelin prospects yet to
appear.
