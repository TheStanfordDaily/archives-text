# CARDINAL RUGGERS, CALIFORNIA BEARS ARE HEAD TEAMS
## 
### Warren Breed 
With the final revision and com
pletion of the California Rugby Un
ion schedule, the Stanford fifteen is
left with six more games, including
conference tilts with U.C.L.A., U.S.C.,
and California.
The decisive Cardinal win over the
S.F. Blues Saturday put them out in
front and established them as a
"team to beat." California's Bears,
with several football men, are also
leading contenders.
Down south there is not the com
petition that is offered around the
bay, so Bruin and Trojan fifteens are
forced to scrape up what scrimmages
they may in their respective back
yards. Reports from Troy, howevex*,
are such that presage a team of no
mean caliber.
The Stanford-S.C. game will take
place in Los Angeles, on February
16. and the "Big Game" on March 2
at Berkeley.

Jan. 26—Claremont here
Feb. 2—U.S.F. here
Feb. 9—Olympic Club here
