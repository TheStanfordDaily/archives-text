GREATEST "NATURAL"
SINCE VANCE FAWCETT

It was no accident that a mere
sophomore guard on the Stanford,
basketball team could dribble j
through the entire set defense of |
the mighty Trojan five, favorites for j
their second successive league title,
ten days ago and drop the ball 1
through the hoop for ttie points that j
meant so much to the Cards' show- j
ing.
For Bryan "Dinty" Moore has been (
practically living with a basketball j
for the past dozen years. He is j
talked of as the greatest "'natural'' •
to come to the Farm since Vance ;
Fawcett. Last year he was the lead- i
ing fro.sh hoopster, and was chosen j
captain at the close of a season in |
which the frosh won 27 games and
lost two.

PLAYS GAME
HIS OWN WAY

Dinty first took up the hoop game
ir. his grammar school days. He has J
at the Farm a group of confirmed
fans who have watched him shoot
buckets day after day, through gram
mar school, junior high, and high j
school. Moore closed his prep days
at Los Angeles High, playing good
enough basketball to gain a place on \
the mythical all-city five.
On coming to Stanford last year.
Moore's facility at handling a basket- j
ball was soon apparent, although i
from the standpoint of the scientific '
basketball now coached, his funda
mentals were far from perfect. How
ever, Dinty had his win style so |
well perfected that Coaches John
Bunn, and Jimmy Bradshaw de
cided that he could play whatever
way he wantpd to.

DINTY MARKS HIT
WITH MIDWEST HOOP FANS

Moore came up to the varsity this
I year and soon had himself estab
' lished as a first stringer. He sus
tained his only injury since being on
i the Farm the day before the Mid
west trip, breaking a blood vessel in
! the knee just as Moscrip had done
before the Big Game. After consid
erable deliberation it was decided
that Moore should make the trip
anyway, on the hope that he might
j be able to play in the last two or
I three games.
Dinty's -comeback was so rapid,
however, that he broke into the line
up of the Notre Dame game, the
third of the trip just a week
' after his injury, and played long

enough to be high-point man.
During the remainder of the trip
he made a hit with the Midwest fans.
In Nebraska his yellow "tforn-shock"
hair was the delight of the grain
farmers. In all the games, despite the
reputation of the Midwest for fum
ing out the greatest players in the
country, Dinty was the best man on
the floor—at least Coach Bunn and
the Card varsity thought so.

A BASKETBALL ACE
WITH POOR EYESIGHT?

Of course if Moore has been play
ing basketball for years and years
and has six feet plus in height and
some 175 pounds in weight, he should
be a good ' basketball player. But
there are few hoopsters who do not
have first-class eyesight, and appar
ently Dinty is one of them.
He is continually being kidded
about "going blind," mostly because
of the way he peers at book print.
Dinty has a good idea himself that
his eyes are not quite what they
should be, and his confidence on the
floor is suffering as a result. The old
bugaboo of wearing glasses keeps
him away from the optometrist, ac
cording to reports, but Stanford i'ol
lcwers will be satisfied if he plays
for his home-town fans next week
end as he' played in the S.C. series
a week ago. —D'Evelyn.
