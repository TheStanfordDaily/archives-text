The navy's giant biplane, XP2H-1, carefully guarded for months from prying eyes while under
construction at Hampton Roads, Va., completed its scheduled non-stop hop of 2,000 miles to Coco Solo,
Canal Zone, from Norfolk, Va., in 25 hours. Six men made the flight. The plane is shown as it was being
launched at Norfolk to start the flight. (Associated Press Photo)
