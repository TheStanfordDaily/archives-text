# Kahn Presents Views On Daily Fee Question
## 
### 
Editor's Note: The columns of
The Daily are open at all times to
the presentation of both sides of
any case. Marvie Kahn's views as
to The Daily financial situation
are herewith presented.
ON THE FIFTEEN CENTS
First, I wish to compliment those
champions of the "Fifteen Cents
Sh t'l Be Retained" issue. Those men
presented good, concise points to
substantiate their arguments. On the
other hand, those who were in favor
of returning the temporary' Daily
grant to the coffers of the Students'
Organization Fund, also showed that
they had given much thought to the
matter.
It is very unfortunate that this
question had to come up, but it cer
tainly is one in which Stanford stu
dents should be interested. I wish
to congratulate the Ex Committee
for the fine way in which the in
dividual members weighed the evi
dence which was presented. I am
sure that there was not a witness pre
sent who will not vouch for the se
riousness of purpose of those who
had to decide the issue.
There are many who may easily

gain the impression that this prob
lem was a personal issue between
The Daily and Ex Committee. How
ever, the reverse was true. At no
time were there any heated argu
ments between the two factions. The
Ex Committee vote was close which
shows that there was plenty of de
liberation by each voting member.
The members of the Ex Committee
including myself, expected a hot at
tack in The Daily this morning. Va
rious members of The Daily staff, no
doubt, spent much time last night
denouncing the vote of those who
dared to vote to take away the tem
porary grant. The students whom you
have selected to represent you will be
painted as dunces and unthinking
minors (to use Mellinkoff phrase
ology)- I assure you that we did
what we thought was the more bene
ficial for the entire student body.
The money, which will be returned
to your Students' Organizations
Fund, will be utilized as a safety fund
for student enterprises and activities
which need further subsidization, in
the opinion of the Executive Com
mittee.
