# Kahn Presents Views On Daily Fee Question
## 
### 
Editor's Note: The columns of
The Daily are open at all times to
the presentation of both sides of
any case. Marvie Kahn's views as
to The Daily financial situation
are herewith presented.
ON THE FIFTEEN CENTS
First, I wish to compliment those
champions of the "Fifteen Cents
Sh t'l Be Retained" issue. Those men
presented good, concise points to
substantiate their arguments. On the
other hand, those who were in favor
of returning the temporary' Daily
grant to the coffers of the Students'
Organization Fund, also showed that
they had given much thought to the
matter.
It is very unfortunate that this
question had to come up, but it cer
tainly is one in which Stanford stu
dents should be interested. I wish
to congratulate the Ex Committee
for the fine way in which the in
dividual members weighed the evi
dence which was presented. I am
sure that there was not a witness pre
sent who will not vouch for the se
riousness of purpose of those who
had to decide the issue.
There are many who may easily

gain the impression that this prob
lem was a personal issue between
The Daily and Ex Committee. How
ever, the reverse was true. At no
time were there any heated argu
ments between the two factions. The
Ex Committee vote was close which
shows that there was plenty of de
liberation by each voting member.
The members of the Ex Committee
including myself, expected a hot at
tack in The Daily this morning. Va
rious members of The Daily staff, no
doubt, spent much time last night
denouncing the vote of those who
dared to vote to take away the tem
porary grant. The students whom you
have selected to represent you will be
painted as dunces and unthinking
minors (to use Mellinkoff phrase
ology)- I assure you that we did
what we thought was the more bene
ficial for the entire student body.
The money, which will be returned
to your Students' Organizations
Fund, will be utilized as a safety fund
for student enterprises and activities
which need further subsidization, in
the opinion of the Executive Com
mittee.
Next, I would like to suggest that, ;
after every student has read what |
can possibly be termed the "'Mid-1
Year Ex Committee Razz Edition," ]
he should take time enough to in- |
vestigate scientifically the situation.
I am sure that if this is done, the |
majox-ity of tfte student body will \
agree with Ex Committee's action j
last night. I personnally feel that I
The Daily can put out a fine paper j
with the old 60-cent allotment.
The Ex Committee is very much i
in favor of increasing the editorial |
budget in some way. If the latter ;
is done, we can expect The Daily to I
maintain the same standard which 1
it has exhibited this year. The Ex ,
Committee will lean over backwards |
to see to it that our paper, one of i
the most important student activities j
at Stanford, is given ample support j
in any expansive program which it i
may undertake. I say this with all i
sincerity, and I know that the Ex i
Committee members will bear me .
out. If The Daily plans to build a (
new building in the future, means
will be found to support the project. ,
No matter what personal attacks
The Daily makes on the Ex Com- \
mittee membrs, we voted on the!
issue as we saw fit, and that is all i
any student can ask of its admin- I
istrators. Your representatives' vote j
was absolutely an expression of pol- i
icy and not one of personal preju- i
dices.
If there are any questions which j
any student wishes to be answered, \
any Ex Committee member or I |
will be happy to express our point j
of view.
There will probably be further dis
cussion on this issue at a later date.
If the matter is forced to come up for (
student vote I hope that every stu- j
dent informs himself in regard to all j
points before he casts his vote. No j
doubt, this issue will be pressed by !
certain factions of The Daily. The j
Daily may or may not be preju- i
dicedâ€”that is for you to decide. The
Ex Committee only hopes that its i
decision is representative of your
desires.

President A.S.S.U. j
