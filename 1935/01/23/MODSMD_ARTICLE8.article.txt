# SINKIANG LOOMS AS WAR SCENE

### 
TOKYO, Jan. 22 (/P).—Sinkiang, a
huge western territory nominally be
longing to China, was indicated by
statements in high official quarters
today as the future scene of a con
test between the expansionist ambi
tions of two great Asiatic powers,
Japan and Soviet Russia.
A spokesman for the Japanese
government said the Soviet's alleged
economic and political penetration
of Sinkiang "menaces the peace and
stability of eastern Asia, which it is
Japan's mission to maintain."
This development was mentioned
by Koki Hirota, foreign minister, in
a formal address to the Diet.
Describing the recent retirement of
Chinese Communist armies from
Kiangsi province into Szechuan and
Kweichow provinces, Hirota said:
"In view of this fact, coupled with
the reported Sovietization of Sin
kiang, the Japanese government will
be obliged to watch with concern
activities of the Communist party
and its armies in China."
With Manchukuo's potentialities as
a breeding ground for a possible
Russo-Japanese conflict considerably
lessened as a result of the virtual
completion of negotiations for the
sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway
from Russia to Japan, Japanese im
perialists are finding new evidences
of a "red menace" against this coun
try's interest in Sinkiang.
