FLEMINGTON, N.J., Jan. 23 </P).
â€”Bruno Richard Hauptmann's car
penter plane was used to fashion the
Lindbergh kidnap ladder and a piece
of the ladder came from Haupt
mann's attic, an expert testified today
in his trial for the kidnaping and
murder of baby Charles A. Lind
bergh, Jr.
Forester Is Expert
Arthur J. Koehler, a government
forester and expert on identification
of woods, said an upright from the
ladder, dpwn which the state charges
the Lindbergh baby was carried to its
death, matched perfectly with a floor
board from Ha,upimann's attic, and
that it had been planed with a tool
found in Hauptmann's garage.
The plane had upon it the initial
"H," and it was put into evidence a
few days ago. Koehler said its own
peculiar markings were left in the
wood of the ladder.
Planes Wood
Improvising a work table on the
judge's bench, the forester demon
strated with the plane on a piece of
North Carolina pine. Shavings rasp
ed from the wood and fell to the
courtroom floor.
The demonstration -Was the second
dramatic "business" of the day. Ear
lier the defense made a police finger
print expert demonstrate his method
of brushing powder onto a piece of
paper to take fingerprints. He, too,
used the judge's bench for a work
shop.
Hauptmann hunched his shoul
ders to show annoyance as he watch
ed the expert use his plane. Koehler
placed a piece of paper on the wood
befoi'e he planed it and rubbed it
with a pencil. Then he planed. He
placed another paper over the board,
again rubbed pencil marks over it,
and finally held up to the jury a
picture of imperfect markings made
by the grooves planed out.
