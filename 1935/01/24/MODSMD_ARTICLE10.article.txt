Women in Madrono were suffering
alternately from chills and heat, and,
contrary to the popular song which
would have it otherwise, it was not
the collective objects of their affec
tions who were causing it.
The Madrono central heating sys
tem was the grievance. Now the fur
nace would be roaring hot; next,
there was no heat at all.
The Corporation Yard investigated,
and the power company's men stud
ied, figured, and puffed at their pipes.
Mankind could do nothing for the
women.
Finally, someone pried the heat
regulating thermostat to pieces and
discovered—ants in the thermostat.
There were thousands swarming
around the little gadget that did th<.
business. When the heat ros:e to a
certain temperature, the weight of
the ants tipped the gadget and stop
ped the heat.
