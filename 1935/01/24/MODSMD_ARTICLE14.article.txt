# CHOOSES TEAM FOR EAST TOUR
## Chapin Tells of Difficulty In Picking Team 
### 
Realizing the importance of the |
transcontinental tour to be under- j
taken next week by the Stanford j
debate team composed of Fred Bold, j
Andrew Bright, Robert Grantier,
and Packy McFarland, Debate Coach
Leland T. Chapin in a special letter
made the following .statement:
"It was an extremely difficult
thing to pick four debaters from the
large group of able speakers on the
Stanford debate squad. I am fully
satisfied at this time that the four j
men chosen to go will ably represent
Stanford. All of them are clear
thinkers, able speakers, and under
stand that a debate tour is a serious
pilgrimage.
Gros Praised
"The man who deserves the most!
credit for the success of this trip is j
our very able debate manager, Rob
ert Gros. Ever since school started
in October, Bob has been an indefa
tigable worker. I cannot say too
much in praise of his work in ar
ranging debates with so many
schools, and in making the tour pos
sible."
Tine intinerary of the transconti
nental team calls for debates with
over 40 of the leading colleges and
universities in the country on four
different subjects for a period of
nearly seven weeks. Bright and Bold
make up one team, touring the mid
continental route to the East, while
Grantier and McFarland take care
of the northeastern and Atlantic
swing.
New Venture
Many of the debates are being
sponsored by the Stanford alumni
groups in the various cities to be
visited in this tour which will be
Stanford's first forensic venture east
of the Rockies in seven years.
The purpose of the tour is perhaps
best expressed in the letter sent by
the Debate Council to each of the 40
colleges which Stanford will debate.
It reads, in part:
"We would like it emphatically
understood that this is not the con
ventional 'barnstorming' trip across
the country in search of victories
and decisions. Wherever our host
school so desires, we are gladly ac
quiescing to decision debates; but
Stanford forensic tradition prefers
non-decision debating.
Seek Truth
"We sincerely feel that some place
between the divergent extremes of
a debatable proposition lies the truth.
To find that truth and to express it
intelligently and ably is the ideal and
motive of a Stanford debater.
"We regard this tour, then, as more
of a scholarly and informal series of
visits to the leading universities of
the United States for the purpose of
exchanging points of view on current
problems, and thus mutually im
proving the knowledge and intellects
of our debaters."
The first debate scheduled is on
January 30, when the Bright and
Bold team will meet the University
of Nevada debaters at Reno.
