# BAND PLAYS IN CONCERT SERIES
## Will H. Bickett To Conduct January 20 Program 
### 
(Editor's Note: This is the first of
a series of articles on the directors
of the three organizations that will
participate in the concert January
30.)
As the second presentation of the
A.S.S.U. Concert Series the Stan
ford Band, Glee Club, and Sym
phony Orchestra will present a joint
program in the Pavilion at 7:30
o'clock Wednesday, January 30.
Will H. Bickett, the director of the
Stanford Band, is known interna
tionally. He is an authority on tone
production as applied to the brass
valve wind and all brass instruments
of the cupped mouth family.
He is the originator of the well-
known "Bickett System" for brass
and wind instruments, under which
many professionals of the musical
world have studied. Of those who
have had instruction under him, six
of them are first-chair men in Sousa's
Band, while many, such as Walt
Roesner of San Francisco, and Rube
Wolf, now of Los Angeles, are promi-
nent musical directors.
Bickett was soloist in all the large
Chicago theatres and concert gar-
dens for a period of over 12 years,
as well as instructor in many noted
conservatories of music. Since 1915
he has conducted summer sessions of
his school in the large cities through-
out the country.
As one of America's outstanding
band directors, Bickett came to Stan-
ford in 1932. Since that time he has
built up the Stanford Band to such
an extent that it is no longer "just
another football band," but rather a
fine concert organization.
For its opening number on the
January 30th concert, the band will
play the well known tone poem
"Finlandia," by Sibelius. This will
be followed by a cornet solo by
Charles Bubb, and next Victor Her
bert's "Serenade."
Tickets for this concert are $1, 75
cents, and 50 cents, and are on sale
at the Concert Series office or at
the Associated Students office in the
Old Union.
