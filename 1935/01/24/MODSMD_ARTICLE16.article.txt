(Editor's Note: This is the first of
a series of articles on the directors
of the three organizations that will
participate in the conccrt January
30.)
As the second presentation of the
A.S.S.U. Concert Series the Stan
ford Band, Glee Club, and Sym
phony Orchestra will present a joint
program in the Pavilion at 7:30
o'clock Wednesday, January 30.
Will H. Bickett, the director of the
Stanford Band, is known interna
tionally. He is an authority on tone
production as applied to the brass
valve wind and all brass instruments j
of the cupped mouth family.
He is the originator of the well- 1
known "Bickett System" for brass j
and wind instruments, under which j
many professionals of the musical!
world have studied. Of those who J
have had instruction under him, six j
of them are first-chair men in Sousa's j
Band, while many, such as Wait,
Roesner of San Francisco, and Rube
Wolf, now of Los Angeles, are promi- I
nent musical directors.
Bickett was soloist in all the large .
Chicago theatres and concert gar- I
dens for a period of over 12 years, ]
as well as instructor in many noted j
conservatories of music. Since 1915 j
he has conducted summer sessions of j
his school in the large cities through- j
out the country.
As one of America's outstanding j
band directors, Bickett came to Stan- !
ford in 1932. Since that time he ha:; |
built up the Stanford Band to such j
an extent that it is no longer "just |
another football band," but rather a j
fine concert organization.
For its opening number on ihei
January 30th concert, the band will i
play the well known tone poem !
"Finlandia," by Sibelius. This wiil j
be followed by a cornet solo by j
Charles Bubb, and next Victor Her
bert's "Serenade."
Tickets for this concert are $1, 7fi
cents, and 50 cents, and are on sale
at the Concert Series office or at
the Associated Students office in the j
Old Union.
