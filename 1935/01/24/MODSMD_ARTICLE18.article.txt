# DOCTORS BUSH, SWAIN TELL OF TWO VOCATIONS
## Opportunities Discussed In Journalism, Physical Science Fields 
### 
Opportunities for work in the fields
of physical sciences and journalism
were discussed last night by Dr.
Robert E. Swain, head of the chem
istry department, and Professor
Chilton R. Bush, head of the journal
ism department, in the third group
of a series of departmental lectures.
Stressing the importance of per
sonal attributes as well as adequate
scientific training, Dr. Robert E.
Swain, head of the chemistry de
partment, described the chances open
to graduates in chemistry, physics,
and mathematics.
Graduate Work Needed
In these fields, he staled, a B.A.
degree is only a "way station," and at
least one year of graduate work is
imperative. Teaching positions, in
dustrial work, and government serv
ice were named as the broadest
fields at present and that of indus
trial management was pointed out as
rapidly expanding.
Professor Eliot Blackwelder briefly
described the positions for geologists:
stating that increasing numbers of
more adequately trained persons
would be placed in coming years.
Acting as chairman of the lecture
was Harry J. Rathburn, associate
professor of law and member of the
Vocational Guidance Committee.
Bush Tells of Paper Field
Opening his lecture with a general
discussion of the types of people who
excel in journalistic work. Profes
sor Bush went on to tell of the op
portunities and the salaries offered in
the newspaper field.
In connection with the latter he
said that the avex-age reporter re
ceives more in the first few years of
work than do workers in other fields,
such as law and medicine, but that
after this the earnings do not in
crease appreciably unless he supple
ments his salary with free-lance
work, or that of a special corre
spondent. K
Bush added that a college educa
tion is becoming more and more nec
essary than in former years, but that,
in spite of this there is still a very
limited field for women unless they
go into bank or department store
advertising.
Gilbert C. Wrenn, chairman of the
Vocational Guidance Committee, in
ti'oduced the speaker.
Additional copies for the mimeo
grophed compilation of wages and
Stanford journalism courses are
available at the offices of Dr. Wrenn
and Professor Bush.
