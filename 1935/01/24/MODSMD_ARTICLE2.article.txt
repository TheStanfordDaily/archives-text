### 
"The Maritime Strike of 1934" will
be the stirring theme of the Walrus
Club meeting tonight at 7:30 o'clock
in the Women's Clubhouse, to which
all students are invited.
William S. Plopkins will delineate
the historical background of die
strike up to the summer of 1933. and
Dwight L. Palmer will take up the
narrative at that point and dwell
upon the events of 1934. Both of the
citizenship instructors are limiting
their remarks to 20 minutes.
The meeting will then be thrown
open for forum discussion and con
tinue as long as interest lasts; al
though the gathering will probably
not last later than 9 o'clock.
