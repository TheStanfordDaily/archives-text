# Legality Questioned In 15 Cent Reduction Of Subscription Fee
## Dean Kirkwood Interprets A.S.S.U. Constitution To See Whether Three-Fourths Vote Required To Lower Daily Price; Decision Later Today 
### IRVIN JORGENSON 
Was an Ex Committee vote of five to four enough to cut The Daily
subscription fee from 75 cents to 60 cents?
Dean Marion Kirkwood of the Law School and official interpreter of
the A.S.S.U. Constitution has been asked by A.S.S.U. President Marvie
Kahn to determine if a three-fourths vote was required. The Dean will

probably announce his decision
sometime today.
On the face of it the 75-ccnt
subscription fee, being a by-law,
apparently requires a three
fourths vote of Ex Committee.
Unquestionably a by-law of the
A.S.S.U. Constitution, as printed in
the Stanford Handbook on page 50,
the provision for The Daily 75 cents
is an integral part of the Finances
by-law, which reads in part.
"Section 2. Collection and Dis
tribution
(a) of the dues collected from
the men students (and in the case
of Daily fees women students
also), the Board of Athletic Control
shall receive one dollar ($1.00);
the Stanford Daily shall receive
seventy-five cents ($0.75); and the
A.S.S.U. shall receive one dollar
and seventy-five ccnts ($1.75)."
That a three-fourths vote is nec
essary to change by-laws, is stated
in the A.S.S.U. Constitution, Article
IX: "The by-laws and charters un-i
der this Constitution may be made,
amended, or revolted by the vote of
three-quarters of the voting mem
bership of the Executive Committee
at a regular meeting; but shall not
take effect until the next regular
meeting; and not then if a petition
containing 150 signatures of mem
bers of this Association asking that
the proposed change be submitted to
a vote of the Association has been
presented to the chairman of the
Executive Committee."
