# Ex Committee's Muddle, And the Daily's Future
## 
### 
The A.S.S.I'. Constitution declares that
"three-quarters ol" the voting membership"
is re(jiiire<l to amend any one of its by-laws.
The Executive Coinniitlee, Tuesday night,
by a vote of live to lour decided to reduce the
I)aii.v's subscription rate by fifteen cents. It
now appears that, inasmuch as that subscrip
tion rale is written into the by-laws, Article
111, Section 2, Tuesday's action is automati
cally voided.
Definite word will come in a ruling from
Dean Kirk wood of the Stanford Law School
Ihis morning.
* * *
Regardless of the verdict, something must
be done to straighten out Stanford's semi
annual muddle of well-meaning, mis-directed,
unfortunate efforts at student government of
matters not familiar to student executives.
Several times during the past few years,
hard-working Executive Committees have
spent a good deal of time voting only to learn
later that the vote did not count for anything
because the legislators did not know their
powers and limitations.
Most of the trouble has come because of the
fact that the Executive Committee has had the
distasteful job of trying to manage a news
paper of which it knows very little.
* * *
The most feasible of all plans is staunchly
advocated by A.S.S.L'. President Marvie Kahn,
who believes that the Daily would be a good
deal better oil if the present editorial setup
were to be retained, but financial independ
ence could make the Daily entirely self-sup
porting with a fixed subscription rate by hav
ing the money paid directly from the com
munity fees fo the Daily business department
by the Hoard of Trustees.
Chaparral, already on this independent and
stimulating basis, has found growth and im
provement by being on its own.
Whether the Daily retains the fifteen cents
no matters for the ultimate good of
the paper and the campus.
The Daily must be free to proceed with
normal, regular improvements without inter
ference from student politics.
To do so, it must he able to keep a pro
tective reserve in case of emergency and it
must be free to serve the campus as best it
can.

were to be retained, but financial independ
ence could make the Daily entirely self-sup
porting with a fixed subscription rate by hav
ing the money paid directly from the com
munity fees fo the Daily business department
by the Hoard of Trustees.
Chaparral, already on this independent and
stimulating basis, has found growth and im
provement by being on its own.
Whether the Daily retains the fifteen cents
no matters for the ultimate good of
the paper and the campus.
The Daily must be free to proceed with
normal, regular improvements without inter
ference from student politics.
To do so, it must he able to keep a pro
tective reserve in case of emergency and it
must be free to serve the campus as best it
can.
