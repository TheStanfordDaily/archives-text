# Behind the I.C.4-A. Proposition

### 
The Hoard of Athletie Control arose with
well-merited indignation yesterday to point
out that not it, hut the Faculty Athletic <lom-
mittee was the chief stumbling hlock in the
way of Stanford's participation in the Inter
collegiate track and field championships this
year. »
The Hoard <>l Athletic Control, it must he
remembered, is concerned only with the finan
cial arrangements which must be made. It is
within its discretion to provide, 1 or "withhold,
funds necessary to make the trip.
Thus far, the faculty committee has not
deemed it pertinent to reconsider the decision
it made with ostensible finality last May. At
that time the committee formally declared its
reluctance at permitting Stanford teams to
attend the Eastern meet. Hut a scrutiny of
its statement made at the time does not dis
close an ironbound determination to with
draw from future attendance, although such
was the inference made at the time.
So there is a ray of hope; since Stanford's
brilliant victories in both the I.C.A.A.A.A. and
N.C.A.A. meets, the Faculty Athletic Commit'
tee may deign to again sanction Stanford
participation on the grounds, if it so chooses,
that the champion should defend its crown.
And then, gentlemen, and not until then,
it will be up to the H.A.C. to scrape the bottom
of its coders clean, and yield up the customary
shekels, should any remain at that time.
