History does not repeat itself. But history does
tend to teach by example.
These words of History Professor Edgar E.
Robinson, probably more than any others, should
be significant to the present Congress as it anxiously
awaits the decision of the Supreme Court on the
fi!) billion "gold clause" c.^se.
There has never been a case exactly like the current
one before the court in previous history, but there have
been cases where consequences and action following
the decision may prove analogous to that following the
gold clause decision which is forthcoming February 4.
Greenbacks were legal tender before February 7,
1870. On that day the Supreme Court declared them
unconstitutional by a vote of 4 to 3. The next year two
new men were added to the court personnel WHO
WERE KNOWN to be pro-greenback. These two threw
their support to the minority and reversed the previous
year's decision by a vote of 4 to 3.
Says Professor Robinson: "Most historians will
agree that the first legal tender decision was to
be expected. Public sympathy was with them.
But the second decision was on the whole more
satisfactory since it reflected the will of Congress,
which at the time was the popular will.
"If the court rules unconstitutional in the gold
clause cvse, it will place itself across the path of
Congress as it did in the legal tender case. And
Congress will be tempted to deal with the court
personnel as they did Ka years ago."
If the government comes out on the small end of
the gold clause decision, it stands to lose the $2,200,-
000,000 "gold profit" stabilization fund and the national
debt will be increased by $17,000,000,000.
It is obvious that the United States government isn't
going to let that much money go by the board simply
because nine black-robed Supreme Court judges could
n't see their way clear to approving the money tinker
ing of Congress. It didn't let the greenbacks go by the
board in 1871 and it is hardly likely that it will let the
gold profit go in 1935, even though it has to extend its
"tinkering" to sly court personnel manipulations.
As Professor Robinson has stated: "This is another
example of the ceaseless struggle between Congress,
supposedly representing the temporary will of the peo
ple, and the courts which attempt to hold up standards
of values unaffected by the immediate situation."
