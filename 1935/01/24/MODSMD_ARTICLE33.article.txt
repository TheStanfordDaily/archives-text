Fraternity rushing, with its survival of the fittest,
! is on this week. Darwin, after investigating the love
life of the slab-sided guinea pig, decided that, whereas
man did not descend from monkeys, he at least
| came pretty close. Nevertheless, fraternity rushing
j begins this week. And when the houses see who sur
vives, they will throw a fittest.
There is a rumor going the rounds about h cer
tain fraternity man, who got a bit high over the
week-end and smashed open fire-alarm boxes in
the city, then drove around corners while the "fire
wagons" drove up. When he woke up the next
morning to find his hand cut-up and his head in a
worse condition, he was considerably saddened to
hear from a venerable law grad that conviction
of smashing fire alarm boxes brings a prison sen-
I tence of one to ten years.
Ever so many misty peeble
Said last week's rhymes were Alpha Phible.
The Alpha Delts heaved a sign of relief Friday when
the Bawlout came out without a certain mistake. Last
quarter, a Miss Margaret Ethel Hull of Denver, Colo.,
I was registered under Alpha Delta Phi.
Of course there is no illegal rushing going on these
1 days of the New Deal arid the increasing social con
; sciousness, but many are the terrific tales of the old
! days, when the houses kept freshmen away from home
and friends for weeks at a time before pledging, and
i high pressured them.
I One house had one of these particularly smooth
rushers that everyone hears about but never sees. He
' took a desirable frosh out for a "contact of a public
j but informal nature," and impressed upon him the
I desirabilities of fraternity life.
Despite the smooth rusher's abilities, the frcsh
nv\n had a great deal of sales resistance. The pair
got all the way down to Los Gatos and still the
freshman had to "talk to his father" or somebody
first. The rusher finally gave up and turned home,
lint before home was reached the car ran out of gas.
I Such was the disgust of the rusher at life and fate
; that he made the frosh walk and get the gas. It is re
; ported that the frosh joined another tong, though I
j can't see why.

The current rumor on the Row is that h certain
j house got a little exuberant and sort of "oversub-
I scribed" its quota, and is now tearing frantically around
1 rying to find some place for its second choices. How-
I ever, it is rather choosy about who it picks, being
afraid to hand over its men to houses that rush strongly
against it, and not daring to sell their men to a second
line of defense house.
