# CAMPUS OPINION

The Editor, Sir:
We who are fortunate enough to
have cars on the campus, as well as j
those pedestrians and laundry men j
who have business at Branner and j
Toyon Halls, feel we are justified in j
our complaint.
The road which runs behind these
two halls is in a deplorable condi- :
tion; in the summer it is a dirt road !
full of deep ruts and holes; in the ;
winter season it is a veritable river:
of mud and expansive puddles. Now j
considering its great use and im
portance, is there any reason that i*
cannot be modernized with some so,rt j
of paving?
Drivers complain that it transfers i
the real estate from the country to I
their automobiles, that the bumps;
shake their vehicles to pieces; pedes- '
trians present as grievance the fact
that passing cars either smother j
them in dust or drown them in mud. J
Why not put some of the extraj
football money to a worthy use and
change the back road from an auto
mobile proving ground to a modern i
thoroughfare? W. H. j
The Editor, Sir:
It is interesting to note that on a
radio program sponsored by a manu
facturer of hosiery, the much talked
of Stanford "rough" was rated fourth
to men from Princeton, Yale, and
Harvard as a style-setter in men's
sox. G. H. C.
