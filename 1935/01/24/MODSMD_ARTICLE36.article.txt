The Editor, Sir:
The charge, implied in the recent J
article of one Mr. Mellinkoff in your
columns, that Sword and Sandals is
a Communist organization, is not to
be endured!
This organization cannot by any j
stretch of even such a jaundiced
imagination as your writer's seems to
be, be classed as a political organiza
tion of any sort.
No view of art as propaganda im- j
pelled the' members to choose this
play, they feeling almost to a man
lhat the Communist theory in this j
respect is lamentably weak.
But Mr. Mellinkoff seems to agree '
with his dreaded opponent, Mr. Sta- |
lin, since he implores ' Sword and
Sandals to read plays as rigidly
ideological, though, to be .sure, on the '
other side of the question, as th" j
one he denounces.
We will not be thus ruled, Mr. !
Mellinkoff! All creeds, all sects, will
be heard in the great commonwealth \
of art, which is not influenced by any 1
defenders of special privilege such as |
the newspaper czar with whom you
have come to agree.
Very truly yours,
James W. Benet j
