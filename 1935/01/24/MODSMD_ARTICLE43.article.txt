ELECTIONS ARE COMING
Government at Stanford has the !
! same evils it has anywhere else, i
Despite the proximity to the altars of
j Cit and Poly Sci, students fall into
; the same political ruts that are sup
i posedly reserved for the ignorant i
i masses.
Elections at Stanford are quain*
affairs: A few interested parties nom
! inate their men for office. The nomi
nees are usually athletic big-shots, or
simply personal friends. The nomi-!
I nees are stuck into office, and never
i heard of again until the next elec
tion. Few people know how they
| perform; few people care. The bus-i- \
\ riess of government is an indifferent >
matter. Then another term rolls by, i
■ and the process is repeated.
i
The functioning of the present Ex
j Committee is a case in point: it is
I not much better or much worse than j
j its predecessors. Yet the few who ;
I sometimes attend Ex Committee \
I meetings know this: that there are j
at least three or four members of ,
that high body who have no more [
place there, than a deaf and dumb i
I policeman has in the intersection of 1
Third and Market. There is one
j member who never bothers to utter a !
j single word. There is one member j
i who has been known to doze off dui - j
ing session. There is one member
i who is always good for a second, and
j nothing more.
If student government at Stanford
i is to be made vital, rather than an i
: atrophying appendage to student j
j life, the campus must take an active ;
| interest in its legislature. Ex Com
mittee meetings should have to be
held in the Assembly Hall (at leas!,
the Little Theatre) to hold the
l crowds who have come to .see "How,
We Are Governed." Then those who
are good would be praised; and those
: who are bad would be damned.
Otherwise, it is a matter of luck—if
we are governed or merely tickled.
To remedy the general naivete as
to the most rudimentary attributes of
a candidate for office, a nominating
assembly would seem advisable. It
should be a first rule that a person
who cannot open his mouth to say
I "I choose to run" is not fitted for
j rapid give and take in Ex Commit
| tee debate. It would seem advisable
that the student body get to know
whether or not there is anything a I
all under the shaggy locks of its
j candidates.

February elections are coming.
Now is the time for all good men to
j come to the aid of themselves.
