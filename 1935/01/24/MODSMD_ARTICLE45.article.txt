RUGBY GAINING ALL
OVER CALIFORNIA

Rugby's popularity is definitely iC
gaining old glory in California. It
is gathering momentum at Stanford
—but that's old stuff now. The thir.r;
is that the English style of football is
picking up interest in all other parts
of the state.
At California across the Bay, they
really yo in for the revived activ
ity. The Bears will furnish the
IL'try Maloney-Jim YYylie com
bine quite some trouble when the
two schools meet in the sport that
once was the Big Game.
U.C.L.A. has already established
rugby as a big part of her winter
program. It was the Bruin fifteen
last year that tied Stanford, 8 to 8,
lor the California collegiate title, re
member?

U.S.C. TROJANS
TAKE TO THE GAME

It is ul th:? University of Southern
California that this year's main sur
prise is noticed, however. Interest
in Southern California generally is
great, and the Los Angeles papers are
loaded with stories and pictures of
local ruggers.
There has been much dickering
in and about the Trojan campus
concerning the scheduling of New
Australian, and Cam
bridge teams to play before Los
Angeles crowds.
The S.C. team started slowly with
nsto 3 defeat at the hands*of Peter
son's All-Stars in the Southern Cali
fornia Rugby Football Union, but
came back with a show of ability
and speed to win their second game,
15 to 0, from the Pasadena All—
Stars.

TROY WILL FURNISH
HEAL COMPETITION

Coach Bill Haney has been having
a bit of trouble teaching his Trojan
proteges to pass and kick more, and
better, instead of running the ball so
much, but they have made definite
advances.
Among the leaders are Cliff
Props!, speedy bnck in American
football, who plays at three
fourths, along with Bill Howard,
an ace kicker. Other standouts on
the Troyville squad are A1 Re
born, standoff, King Hall, and Led
ingham, who play in the scrum.
Stanford will meet the Trojans m
the Los Angeles Coliseum on Febru
ary 16, and by that time it seems the
rapidly-developing U.S.C. ruggers
will be in a position to question the
Stanford-U.C.L.A. supremacy.
However, the Indians are also add
ing some frills to their game, and if
normal improvement during the sea
son even partially matches that
shown in the past two weeks, the
Cardinals will be able to take care
of themselves. Passing - like that
shown last week by Joe Vigna,
Johnny Reisner, and Fred Abbott,
and the kicking of Ray Lewis will
be hard to beat. —Browne.
