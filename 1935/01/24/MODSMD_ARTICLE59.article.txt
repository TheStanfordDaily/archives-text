# LEIGHTON DETECTS POISONOUS VAPORS IN CHEM BUILDING
## 
### Taber Engelke 
Invisible poisonous vapors are ris
ing from the floors in almost every
room in Ihe Chemistry Building.
These gases are so injurious that the
breathing of them continuously for
about five months will obliterate
memory. Several great scientists
have been so afflicted in later life.
Vapors arise from mercury com
pounds, and there is enough quick
silver in a handful of dirt scraped
from the floor of a chemistry labora
tory to produce a vapor visible in
the beam of an ultra-violet lamp.
Detects Dangerous Vapor
The method of detecting these in
jurious gases was discovered by Pro
fessor P. A. Leighton of the chem
istry department. By placing floor
sweepings in front of a fluorescent
screen, and turning on the ultra
violet. lamp, a lavender shadow re
sembling steam can be thrown on the
green background.
There would be no radio, Leighton
said, were it not for the far ray, one
form of ultra-violet light. This ray
is absorbed in oxygen 60,000 feet
above the surface of the earth, and
it forms a dense layer of atmosphere.
Were it not for this heavy ozone
mantle just below the stratosphere,
radio waves would radiate into
space and never be reflected back
to the earth.
No in Ozone
Scientists believe that if adven
turers into the stratosphere were to
rise above this ozone mantle they
would not be able to send radio mes
sages to the world.
Leighton also works with cold
light—a curious phenomenon of light
without heat, fading from ice blue to
a deep purple. Fireflies, he said, use
a similar chemical reaction to regen
erate their tiny lighting mechanism
in the moments between flashes.
