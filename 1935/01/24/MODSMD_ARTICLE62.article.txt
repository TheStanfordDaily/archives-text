Sad, indeed, is the case of Madame
T. The Madame led a life of use
fulness, faithful to her owner for
many, many months.
But now Madame T. stands deso
late by the side of the road, a
broken-down bit of elegance. The
heavy rains have not been kind to
her exterior. What were once shiny
green wheels are now just wheels,
and Madame T.'s glossy tan duco
finish is only a combination of rust
and chipped paint.
During autumn quarter, the mys
tery car was driven around by her
proud owner, a certain Encina spon
sor. He treated her well, as befitted
a venerable member of the T species.
But one day something happened.
Madame T. disappointed her own
er, and he left her by the side of the
road. Came Christmas, and one
morning someone took three of her
tires, leaving her a flat one and three
rims to stand on.
But Madame T. lived on alone. All
through the vacation she stood in
silent dignity, a living reproof to the

man who had deserted her. "And
still the Madame stands by the side
of the road, a jack under the rear
axle keeping her from turning com
pletely over.
She knows full well that never
will her owner have the heart to
send her to her Valhalla, some
Mountain View junk yard.
