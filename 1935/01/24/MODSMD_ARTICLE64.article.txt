# 'Back to Land' Relief Measure Before House
## 
### 
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 23 (/P).â€”A
state-sponsored "Back to the Land"
movement on a gigantic scale was
proposed today by Assemblyman
Lyon, Los Angeles.
Lyon suggested that $2,000,000 or
more of the $24,000,000 unemploy
ment relief bond issue be used to es
tablish "subsistence farms.". Unem
ployed families would be placed on
these farms, which would be ap
proximately 40 acres in size and scat
tered in colonies throughout the
state.
State Gives Materials
The state would furnish a home,
waler, implements, seed, livestock,
and fowls and provide temporary
support until the families harvested
their first crops and became self
supporting.
The first of the subsistence farm
projects would be established im
mediately in the Owens Valley in
Inyo County and along the Mojave
River in San Bernardino County,
probably in the Ontario, Chino Dis
trict.
Commissioner Directs
Other colony sites would be se
lected by the state Unemployment
Relief Commission after hearings
were held regarding the respective
sites submitted.
Lyon estimated 25,000 people could
be placed on farms in the Owens
Valley alone and expressed c'onli
dence that arrangements for use of
the land could be made with the City
of Los Angeles, which owns piac
tically all of the valley.
No Charge
The bill provides that while un
employed families could eventually
acquire title to their farms, no charge
would be made by the state for ren
tal for the equipment oy slipport ad
vanced to them before they became
self-sustaining.
After a heated discussion of "shy
ster" lawyers and the ethics of the
legal profession, the Assembly over
whelmingly voted to investigate the
conduct of the California state bar,
quasi-official governing body of at
torneys in this state.
