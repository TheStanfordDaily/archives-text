# Sword and Sandals To Present Russian Drama
## 
### 
Sword and Sandals have scheduled
as their next reading a dyed-in-the
red Soviet drama. It is entitled
"Fear."
The popular dramatic society de
i nies that it has become a hot-bed for
I political sedition, but claims to have
j chosen the play because of its dra-
I matic value and significance. The
; play contains many surprises and in
novations. It was written by Al"x-
I ander Afinogenyev, and the names
I of the characters are even more un
pronounceable.
Tryouts for paÂ» ts will be held from
'3 to 5 o'clock this afternoon in the
Little Theatre. All students are eli-
I gible and are invited to try for roles.
| The reading, directed by Bob Dwan,
j will be produced a week from today.
