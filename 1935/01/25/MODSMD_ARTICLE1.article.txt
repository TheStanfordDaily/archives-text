# Fraternity Men Join for Pledge Dance Tonight
## 
### 
A spirit of brotherhood rivalled
only by the Yuletide season is
scheduled for the Stanford cam
pus tonight.
Yep, it's pledge night, and the
Greek brothers give way to the
more magnanimous interests, some
even going as far as to refrain
from "wolfing" dates from the less
worldly, in many cases, pledge
brothers.
That's the set-up as they begin
their official celebration â€”the an
nual pledge dance, prom, informal
or what have you.
The pledge dance begins this ev
ening at 9 o'clock in the Women's
gymnasium and dance studio, and
will be concluded with a breakfast
at 1:30 o' clock. Campus women's
deadline is 2:30 this year.
All houses will have open house
during the evening, and traffic will
be thick to and from each of the 24
Greek dwellings.
The houses split the cost of the
dance, and each of the 250-odd neo
phytes are to be awarded free ad
mission.
Ernie Heckscher and his orches
tra will furnish music in one wing
of the gymnasium, while Gordy
I leche's band will be on hand at the
other side of the court.
Interfraternity Council members
Tuesday night voted to make the
dance semi-formal instead of for
mal as was formerly planned.
There was a premium on dates
today as many of the pledges and
fraternity men were late in apply
ing and found the "line busy ' in
campus feminine strongholds.
Patrons and patronesses chosen
are Dr. and Mrs. Ray Lyman Wil
bur, Dean and Mrs. George Cul
ver, Mr. and Mrs. Almon I'.. Roth,
Dr. and Mrs. Joseph Hinsey, and
Dr. and Mrs. C. Gilbert Wrenn.
