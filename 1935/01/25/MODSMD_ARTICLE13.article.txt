# 1934 Pledge Crop Set New Record
## 
### 
Last year's rushing period net
ted the 24 fraternities 011 the cam
pus a total of 267 pledges, an aver
age of approximately eleven per
house.
The largest number to be pledg
ed by any one fraternity was 20,
and the smallest group
three with several pledging as
many as 15 and a few pledging only
five or six.
Last year's 267 pledges by far
outdistanced the number pledged
in any former years, the preceding
year's number to "go Row" being
only 196.
A sudden rise in new men ad
mitted last year was given by
many as the cause for the large
number pledged. Also, many
houses were "getting low" on men
after a rather meager season the
ycai before.
