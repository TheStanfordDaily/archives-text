### BY OUR HASHER 
Down the booby hatch went
ever so many delightful athletes,
legacies, friends, Romans, and
countrymen today as every frater
nity on the Row pledged the
"Kappa" class.
Many have been the delightful
soirees, binges, toots, and busts
during the past five months, when
even hardy seniors have gotten
fallen arches standing around try
ing to appear interested in con
versations on family Packards,
European tours, Renaissance art,
and prove at the same time their
perfect equanimity.
The delightful charm about
men's rushing is that nobody
knows what freshmen are going
what house. There arc many

contacts of a public but ephemeral
nature, but the boys in the house
scarcely know any freshmen at all.
For instance, by a peculiar stroke
of fate, the Kappa Sigs pledged all
the freshmen Alpha O hashers,
and Chi Psis were scurrying all
over Woodside last night looking
for flying fish, and there are many
football players who will be water
ing a begonia plant all next year,
while the house waters its stock
in housebills.
Now, it's all over. The pled
ges will come up to the houses
every Saturday night to get "bet
ter acquainted with the boys" and
incidentally to scrub out wash
bowls, clean ping-pong rooms,
massage weeds, and shine door
plates.
