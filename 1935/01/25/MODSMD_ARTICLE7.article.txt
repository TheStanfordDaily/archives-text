# FRATERNITIES PLEDGE 288
## Guns, Bells Herald Big Parade; New All-Time Record Made 
### 
Well, it's all over.
When 288 freshmen walked up the Row this afternoon toward the
houses that will be their homes for three years, several hundred fra
ternity men breathed much easier, the worry of some four months'
rushine ended for another year.

The class was larger than the
record set last year when 267 neo
phytes were pledged, although last
year's collection came very close
to filling many of the houses
which find themselves this year
with very few men graduating or
leaving.
The Big Parade today was punc
tuated with firing of bombs, ring
ing of bells, and various other
jovial noises heralding the arrival
of a new man to some house or
other.
Activities at the houses since 8
o'clock last night have been few,
most members preferring to sit
around counting on their fingers
the number of men "all sewed up"
and those with a doubtful mark.
Bidding cards were sent in this
morning, and the fraternity lawyer
was kept busy from 1 to 4:30 o'-
o'clock this afternoon interviewing
the men of '38 who will move up
Lasuen way next fall. "Fourteen
to a house" was the rule for fresh
men, and few houses came out of
the struggle entirely unscathed as
to number. Pledging of sopho
mores was heavy in addition to
the number of freshmen signed up.
Some dozens of freshmen who
were "lost in the shuffle" will wait
at least 72 hours before they can
be pledged by any house, but a
large number of these will fill the
lists of houses with short quotas.
When the excitement of pledg
ing was over, freshmen who found
themselves pledged returned to
Encina to prepare for the "big
event" of the fraternal year, the
Pledge Prom.

record set last year when 267 neo
phytes were pledged, although last
year's collection came very close
to filling many of the houses
which find themselves this year
with very few men graduating or
leaving.
The Big Parade today was punc
tuated with firing of bombs, ring
ing of bells, and various other
jovial noises heralding the arrival
of a new man to some house or
other.
Activities at the houses since 8
o'clock last night have been few,
most members preferring to sit
around counting on their fingers
the number of men "all sewed up"
and those with a doubtful mark.
Bidding cards were sent in this
morning, and the fraternity lawyer
was kept busy from 1 to 4:30 o'-
o'clock this afternoon interviewing
the men of '38 who will move up
Lasuen way next fall. "Fourteen
to a house" was the rule for fresh
men, and few houses came out of
the struggle entirely unscathed as
to number. Pledging of sopho
mores was heavy in addition to
the number of freshmen signed up.
Some dozens of freshmen who
were "lost in the shuffle" will wait
at least 72 hours before they can
be pledged by any house, but a
large number of these will fill the
lists of houses with short quotas.
When the excitement of pledg
ing was over, freshmen who found
themselves pledged returned to
Encina to prepare for the "big
event" of the fraternal year, the
Pledge Prom.

Activities at the houses since 8
o'clock last night have been few,
most members preferring to sit
around counting on their fingers
the number of men "all sewed up"
and those with a doubtful mark.
Bidding cards were sent in this
morning, and the fraternity lawyer
was kept busy from 1 to 4:30 o'-
o'clock this afternoon interviewing
the men of '38 who will move up
Lasuen way next fall. "Fourteen
to a house" was the rule for fresh
men, and few houses came out of
the struggle entirely unscathed as
to number. Pledging of sopho
mores was heavy in addition to
the number of freshmen signed up.
Some dozens of freshmen who
were "lost in the shuffle" will wait
at least 72 hours before they can
be pledged by any house, but a
large number of these will fill the
lists of houses with short quotas.
When the excitement of pledg
ing was over, freshmen who found
themselves pledged returned to
Encina to prepare for the "big
event" of the fraternal year, the
Pledge Prom.

When 288 freshmen walked up the Row this afternoon toward the
houses that will be their homes for three years, several hundred fra
ternity men breathed much easier, the worry of some four months'
rushine ended for another year.

The class was larger than the
record set last year when 267 neo
phytes were pledged, although last
year's collection came very close
to filling many of the houses
which find themselves this year
with very few men graduating or
leaving.
The Big Parade today was punc
tuated with firing of bombs, ring
ing of bells, and various other
jovial noises heralding the arrival
of a new man to some house or
other.
Activities at the houses since 8
o'clock last night have been few,

Well, it's all over.
When 288 freshmen walked up the Row this afternoon toward the
houses that will be their homes for three years, several hundred fra
ternity men breathed much easier, the worry of some four months'
rushine ended for another year.

The class was larger than the
record set last year when 267 neo
phytes were pledged, although last
year's collection came very close
to filling many of the houses
which find themselves this year
with very few men graduating or
leaving.
The Big Parade today was punc
tuated with firing of bombs, ring
ing of bells, and various other
jovial noises heralding the arrival
of a new man to some house or
other.
Activities at the houses since 8
o'clock last night have been few,
most members preferring to sit
around counting on their fingers
the number of men "all sewed up"
and those with a doubtful mark.
Bidding cards were sent in this
morning, and the fraternity lawyer
was kept busy from 1 to 4:30 o'-
o'clock this afternoon interviewing
the men of '38 who will move up
Lasuen way next fall. "Fourteen
to a house" was the rule for fresh
men, and few houses came out of
the struggle entirely unscathed as
to number. Pledging of sopho
mores was heavy in addition to
the number of freshmen signed up.
Some dozens of freshmen who
