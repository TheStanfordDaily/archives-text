# BRUIN QUINTET DEFEATS CARDS IN TWO GAMES
## Indians Lose 34-27, 38-32, Over Week-end; Hold Low Coast Place TO PLAY CAL FRIDAY Cal Receives Double Defeat At Hands of S.C. 
### Mort D'Evelyn 
Coach John Bunn brought his In
dian varsity back to the Farm last
night from Los Angeles and the two
trimmings by U.C.L.A., 04 to 27 and
38 to 32, which sent the Curds into
the cellar in the Coast Conference
race.
This afternoon the varsity will
begin practice for their second
game with California, scheduled
for this Friday night in the Pa
vilion. Cal, which defeated Stan
ford 45-31 a week ago, lost twice
to the Trojans over the week-end,
putting the Bears in third place.
In the two U.C.L.A. games the
Cards stayed right with the Bruins
until the final few minutes, with the
southern five tallying heavily and
earning the victories in the closing
minutes of play. As he had almost
single-handed defeated California
two weeks previously, John Ball,
U.C.L.A.'s sophomore center ace,
played a large part in the Friday win
by scoring nine points and came back
Saturday night to provide the win
ning margin and more by tallying 17.
Stanford, on the other hand,
seemed to be pl-vying the dcsulta
tory basketball that has slowed up
their game since the win over the
Trojans two weeks ago. Howell
Turner, forward, led in scoring for
the series with 12 in the first game
and two in the second. Robin Lind
sey, guard, followed with a total
of It.
With Ball scoring 26 points in the
two panics from the center of the
court, the Cards suffered from the
absence of Keith Topping, hu.sky
center, who was unable to make the
trip at the last minute because of an
infected hand. It is expected that he
will be back with the squad for
today's practice. The other injury,
Howell Turner's "charley - horse,"
bothered the forward considerably in
the second game, but should be en
tirely healed by Friday night, no
midweek game being scheduled this
week.
