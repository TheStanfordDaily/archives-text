# PROPOSED OPERA MILDLY FAVORED
## Opinion Varies Concerning Spring Production 
### 
The condensed opinion of several
) students 011 the campus as to the
j desirability of presenting a student
, written musical spring quarter seems
to be only partially in favor of the
i idea.
Gordon Heche, well-known or-
I chestra leader, who remembers
' many junior operas of former spring
quarters, lays the failure of the last
| ones to a lack of interest, either in
| their writing or casting.
Shelley Smith, who has taken the
i lead in several campus plays, also re
members the spring operas as being
i "very funny, and very entertaining."
As far as this year goes, she does not
seem to think that "we have any
I women who can sing to take the
1 parts."
j Dick Frank, dramatic manager,
! says that "the idea is excellent—
when we have our new theatre
built." He further stated that the
last three operas lost on an average
i of from three to four hundred dol
lars, and that this year it would be
j necessary to pay the orchestra at the
I new union rate of $2 an hour, thus
j increasing the outlay considerably. .
Last year the Ex Committee voted
' againsl another student musical, and
j it remains to be seen whether there
; is enough enthusiasm and talent on
i the campus to bring it back
• spring.
