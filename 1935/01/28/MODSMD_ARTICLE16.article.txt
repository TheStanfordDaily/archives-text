# Essential Rights of Labor at Stake In Currant State Syudicalism Trial
## 
### ELINOR KAHN 
As the prosecution today enters
the second phase of its case against
18 workers on trial in Sacramento
for violation of the Criminal Syn
dicalism law, it becomes increasingly
evident that the trial is concerned
not with party affiliations, but with
the fundamental right of labor to
organize strikes and picket lines, to
exercise free speech and assembly.
The Communist Party is legal in
California to the extent that its
candidates appear on the ballots
of the state at elections, yet the
first count of the indictment
against these workers pertains to
membership in such u party. Ob
viously all the members of the
Communist Party of the state have
not been arrested, and some other
reason must be found for the trial.
That the members of the Agricul
tural and Cannery Workers Indus
trial Union have made life difficult
for the many big- farmers who want
to keep labor costs as low its possible
is definite. Members of the A. and
C.W.1.U., by striking and getting
higher wages for agricultural and
cannery workers, have become an
economic menace, and are being
prosecuted. That is why the prose-
J cution is attempting to show that
the Communist Party, the Sacra

mento Workers School, and the A.
! and C.W.I.U. are one and the same
I in personnel and activity.
Not content (o let this important
case continue regularly, Attorney
I General Webb appointed as special
| prosecutor for the case in place of
Otis I). Babcock, district attorney
of Sacramento, Neil MacAllistcr,
j ex-I). A., who had been defeated by
i Bibcock in November. Webb's
power of appointment serves to
show the desire of the prosecution
] to use every method at its com
mand for securing a conviction.
The prosecution has been on the
island for a week and a half, with
I Officers Russ and Kuntz, of the Red
! Squad, identifying documentary evi
dence to be lead into the court rec-
I ord. By careful cutting the prosecu
! tion has managed to read only the
! most damaging points in each docu
-1 ment or exhibit. The defense in an
attempt to prove its innocence, will
; be forced to read from each exhibit
j much that was left unread by the
| prosecution; for this reason the trial
will probably last another two
months.
Among the defendants who have
been active in labor organization
around Sacramento are: Pat Cham
bers, who was acquitted of criminal
.syndicalism in Visalia in 1933: Nora

iConklin, so-called alien agitator by
j the prosecutor, and actual descend
i ;irit of Mathew Trumbull, signer of
| the Declaration of Independence;
I Norman Mini, Sacramento boy and
j ex-West Pointer; A1 Hougardy, Sac
j ramento organizer; and Caroline
| Decker, secretary of the Agricultural
land Cannery Workers Industrial
Union.
| Decker, when interviewed, stat
ed: "Every agency of capitalism in
lite state is behind the prosecution.
MacAllister's defeat last Novem
ber \v Â«s a good indication that the
people are not prosecuting the case.
We could all be Communists, and
not be prosecuted; but as soon a:*,
we are Communists who have ac
tually participated in forcing Cali
fornia capitalists to kick through
with higher wages, we are put on
trial."
Under the indictments made
I against the 18 workers, a conviction
j on one count is virtually a convic
. tion on all three. To effect any con
viction the prosecution must prove
that the workers on trial by their
interest or membership in certain or
ganizations, and by their resultant
activity, were desirous of overthrow
ing the government and changing in
dustrial ownership by force or vio
lence. That is the prosecution's job.
