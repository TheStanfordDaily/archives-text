# DODDS CLAIMS POPULAR RULE WILL CONTINUE
## Princeton President Speaks Before 500 Friday In Assembly Hall 
### John McClelland 
Princeton's president, Harold Wil
lis Dodds, speaking before a group
of 500 persons in the Assembly liall
Friday morning, answered his inter
rogative talk topic: "Can Democracy
Be Preserved" with three significant
predictions.
"Despite popular talk, America
is not going to surrender popular
government. It is going to be a
long time before the United States
accepts dictatorship or control by
any above group.
"Functions of the present gov
ernment are bound to expand.
"We are going to have more and
more lay co-operation in our gov
ernment."
Dr. DodcLs cxpluined that the
problems of popular government are
decidedly more complex now than
in the preceding century, but that
nevertheless Democracy is the first
demand of the public will.
"Today the government is begin
ning to accept responsibility for
maintaining decent standards of liv
ing for everyone," Dr. Dodds de
clared. "But in asserting or exercis
ing that responsibility, the govern
ment is making certain mistakes.
Deplores Sports
"Social force's are driving the gov
ernment to expand its scope beyond
its limitations. Restrictionism and
salvaging have retarded the depres
sion." >
Dr. Dodds deplored the present
state of tho politician and the tend
ency of the general public to remain
aloof from government.
"Government is our major in
dustry and yet it offers poor
chances for jobs. This because of
the presence of what was once
called the 'spoils system.' Men in
government arc still 'winners';
politicians restricted in action by
the popular attitude toward poli
ticians.
Dr. Dodds explained that men of
government are handicapped be
cause they work in a field of high
visibility — the public watches their
every move, and because higher
standards of conduct are applied to
politicians than to other people.
Need More Elite
"Government has got to get more
of the elite into it, and by the elite I
mean trained men who are compe
tent and untainted by political prom
ises," Dr. Dodds concluded.
After being introduced by Presi
dent Wilbur, Dr. Dodds stated that
he believed Pricneton and Stanford
to be intellectual brothers, not sisters
"because we are not co-educational."
He expressed the hope that even
tually athletic relations might be es
tablished between the two schools.

"Social force's are driving the gov
ernment to expand its scope beyond
its limitations. Restrictionism and
salvaging have retarded the depres
sion." >
Dr. Dodds deplored the present
state of tho politician and the tend
ency of the general public to remain
aloof from government.
"Government is our major in
dustry and yet it offers poor
chances for jobs. This because of
the presence of what was once
called the 'spoils system.' Men in
government arc still 'winners';
politicians restricted in action by
the popular attitude toward poli
ticians.
Dr. Dodds explained that men of
government are handicapped be
cause they work in a field of high
visibility — the public watches their
every move, and because higher
standards of conduct are applied to
politicians than to other people.
Need More Elite
"Government has got to get more
of the elite into it, and by the elite I
mean trained men who are compe
tent and untainted by political prom
ises," Dr. Dodds concluded.
After being introduced by Presi
dent Wilbur, Dr. Dodds stated that
he believed Pricneton and Stanford
to be intellectual brothers, not sisters
"because we are not co-educational."
He expressed the hope that even
tually athletic relations might be es
tablished between the two schools.
Princeton's president, Harold Wil
lis Dodds, speaking before a group
of 500 persons in the Assembly liall
Friday morning, answered his inter
rogative talk topic: "Can Democracy
Be Preserved" with three significant
predictions.
"Despite popular talk, America
is not going to surrender popular
government. It is going to be a
long time before the United States
accepts dictatorship or control by
any above group.
"Functions of the present gov
ernment are bound to expand.
"We are going to have more and
more lay co-operation in our gov
ernment."
Dr. DodcLs cxpluined that the
problems of popular government are
decidedly more complex now than
in the preceding century, but that
nevertheless Democracy is the first
demand of the public will.
"Today the government is begin
ning to accept responsibility for
maintaining decent standards of liv
ing for everyone," Dr. Dodds de
clared. "But in asserting or exercis
ing that responsibility, the govern
ment is making certain mistakes.
