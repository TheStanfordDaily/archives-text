# RUSSIA TOPIC OF TUESDAY SPEECH
## W. H. Chamberlin To Tell Of Soviet Problems

"Ten Years in Soviet Russia" will
be the subject of a lecture by Wil
liam H. Chamberlin, former Moscow
correspondent for the Christian Sci
ence Monitor, tomorrow evening at
7:30 o'clock in the Assembly Hall.
Russia, according to Chamberlin,
is now at work on a second Five-
Year Plan. The new plan differs
from the first in making more provi
sion for the every-day needs of the
people and in stressing quality rather
than quantity, and efficient operation
rather than .the chaotic and disor
derly large-scale building lhat was
so characteristic of the first plan.
Sums Up Results
In summing up the results of the
last Five-Year Plan Chamberlin lists
on the credit side the big new indus
trial plants, and an agricultural sys
tem that has been shaped to the gov
ernment's requirements.
On the negative side he places one
of the greatest famines of history,
which occurred during the last part
of 1933 and cost the lives of at least
three million people. The cause of
this famine was the Soviet's large
requisitions of grain, despite the fact
that the harvests were far below av
erage in 1931 and 1932, and the re
fusal of the Soviet government to
permit any first-hand reporting of
the famine while it was going on,
which cut off the possibility of relief
from abroad.
Hardship Exists
Even where actual famine did not
prevail conditions of extreme hard
ship and destitution existed. Cham
berlin believes that it is safe to say
that four-fifths of the Russian people
are at the present time existing on a
lower standard of living than falls to
the lot of the average British or
American unemployed.
Another item on the debit side of
(he Soviet Plan is the inhuman sys
tem of forced labor that has grown
up. Almost all the big enterprises of
the Fi"e-Year Plan were built with
a considerable application of forced
labor, for example, the large canal
which links the White and Baltic
seas was built by prisoners, criminal
and political, under the direction of
the Gay-Pay-00, or political police.
