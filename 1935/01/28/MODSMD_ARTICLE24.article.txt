# War Library Book Reveals Wilsonian Pledge To Europe
## Dr. R. H. Lutz Issues Book Dealing on Austrian Peace Settlement 
### Cedric Larson 
When the spectre of possible con
! flict over the Suar was laid to rest
a fortnight ago by a decisive Nazi
plebiscite, another aparition arose
!to haunt the minds of European
♦statesmen — the Anschluss. France
is determined to block German ex-
I pansion in the Danube, while Hitler
' is equally resolved that the swastika
shall fly over all German-speaking
! areas of Europe.
Simultaneously with the resusci
tated question of the Anschluss, a
. Hoover War Library volume, the
' work of Dr. Ralph Hasweil Lutz
, and Nina Almond, brings to light
the pledge of America's war presi- *
dent, Woodrow Wilson, to guaran
tee the territorial integrity of the
1!>19 settlements by American
forces. The book is entitled, "The
j Treaty of St. Germain," and is a
selection of documents bearing on
i this settlement taken from the rich
Hoover War Library archives.
Secret proceedings of the eighth
plenary session of the peace confer
ence in Paris on May 31, 1919, are
; given in this volume, including a
| sensational speech of the president.
1 Parts of Wilson's speech leaked out,
and it was asserted by many authori
ties he promised European states
; men to send the American army and
navy to Europe to enforce violations
| oi treaty settlement.
The stenographic report of Wil
son's speech has at last been pub
lished, and appears in the Hoover
! War Library volume verbatim. The
president made an impassioned plea
for self-determination of peoples in
j treaty settlements:
] "When the decisions are made, the
i Allied and Associated Powers guar-
I antee to maintain them," the presi
dent said. He then stated the mili
tary and naval strength of the major
powers was the guarantee of world
peace in the last analysis.
"How can a power like the
United States, for example, for I
on speak for no other," said Wil
son dramatically, "after signing
this treaty, if it contains elements
which they do not believe 'will be
permanent, go 3.000 miles away
across the sea and report to its
people that it has made a settle
ment of the peace of the world? It
cannot do so.
"And yet there underlies all of
these transactions the expectation
on the part, for example, of Rou
niania, and Czecho-Slovakia, and
of Serbia, that if any covenants
of this settlement arc not observed,
the United States will send her
armies and her navies to sec that
they ,<*re observed."
Wilson had in mind a powerful
League of Nations, supported by an
j international police force to which
the United States would furnish its
quota of troops and ships, which
would see that the stipulations of
the treaties were carried out.
Wilson's hopes were dashed, how
| over, upon his arrival at home where
he found his League of Nations and
peace treaties alike viewed with sus 5
I picion.
Austria had petitioned later in the
summer of 1919 for union with Ger
many,- and the Hoover War Library
volume gives the plea in full. Franc",
however, turned thumbs down on
| Austria's pan-German wishes, and
by the terms of the Treaty of St.
Germain, Austria was compelled
forever to remain separate from Ger
many without sanction of the council
of the League—a League to which
Germany no longer belongs.

1 Parts of Wilson's speech leaked out,
and it was asserted by many authori
ties he promised European states
; men to send the American army and
navy to Europe to enforce violations
| oi treaty settlement.
The stenographic report of Wil
son's speech has at last been pub
lished, and appears in the Hoover
! War Library volume verbatim. The
president made an impassioned plea
for self-determination of peoples in
j treaty settlements:
] "When the decisions are made, the
i Allied and Associated Powers guar-
I antee to maintain them," the presi
dent said. He then stated the mili
tary and naval strength of the major
powers was the guarantee of world
peace in the last analysis.
"How can a power like the
United States, for example, for I
on speak for no other," said Wil
son dramatically, "after signing
this treaty, if it contains elements
which they do not believe 'will be
permanent, go 3.000 miles away
across the sea and report to its
people that it has made a settle
ment of the peace of the world? It
cannot do so.
"And yet there underlies all of
these transactions the expectation
on the part, for example, of Rou
niania, and Czecho-Slovakia, and
of Serbia, that if any covenants
of this settlement arc not observed,
the United States will send her
armies and her navies to sec that
they ,<*re observed."
Wilson had in mind a powerful
League of Nations, supported by an
j international police force to which
the United States would furnish its
quota of troops and ships, which
would see that the stipulations of
the treaties were carried out.
Wilson's hopes were dashed, how
| over, upon his arrival at home where
he found his League of Nations and
peace treaties alike viewed with sus 5
I picion.
Austria had petitioned later in the
summer of 1919 for union with Ger
many,- and the Hoover War Library
volume gives the plea in full. Franc",
however, turned thumbs down on
| Austria's pan-German wishes, and
by the terms of the Treaty of St.
Germain, Austria was compelled
forever to remain separate from Ger
many without sanction of the council
of the League—a League to which
Germany no longer belongs.
When the spectre of possible con
! flict over the Suar was laid to rest
a fortnight ago by a decisive Nazi
plebiscite, another aparition arose
!to haunt the minds of European
♦statesmen — the Anschluss. France
is determined to block German ex-
I pansion in the Danube, while Hitler
' is equally resolved that the swastika
shall fly over all German-speaking
! areas of Europe.
Simultaneously with the resusci
tated question of the Anschluss, a
. Hoover War Library volume, the
' work of Dr. Ralph Hasweil Lutz
, and Nina Almond, brings to light
the pledge of America's war presi- *
dent, Woodrow Wilson, to guaran
tee the territorial integrity of the
1!>19 settlements by American
forces. The book is entitled, "The
j Treaty of St. Germain," and is a
selection of documents bearing on
i this settlement taken from the rich
Hoover War Library archives.
