Tliiil Princeton's president is ;i 111:111 in lime
with Hie limes, is (lie impression one received
Irom Dr. Harold Willis Dodds' stimulating
discussion Insl I'ridav of I lie fate of American
democracy.
( Democracy will survive, Dr. Dodds believes,
not merely liccausc il is a glorious heritage of
American life, as the silver-tongues would say,
bill because it is adaptable and has something
practical lo oiler.
The need of the populace for "ham and cab
hagc," as Dr. Dodds graphically expresses it,
is one of the principal reasons for the rise of
dictators. Ity stealing the thunder of the dic
tators and supplying the much-desired "ham
and cahhage" in the form of economic security
and greater governmental protection and reg
ulation, democracy can and will survive.
Princeton's political scientist president is
under no illusions about the unsullied, ideal
istic nature of a democracy. The spoils sys
tem and low politicians abound. Hut these are
accepted as more or less inevitable concomi
tants of Hie system, to be coinbatled, partly at
least, only if the t'nilcd States adopts an ex
tensive civil service system like Kngland's.,
Politicians of some sort, however, must con
tinue, to act as eo-ordinators of the adminis
trative service and to express the popular will.
Though the ship of state of the dictator may
be a smooth-sailing vessel for a while. Dr.
Dodds believes America will trust to the
greater safely of democracy's rail even though
"one's feet are always in the water."
