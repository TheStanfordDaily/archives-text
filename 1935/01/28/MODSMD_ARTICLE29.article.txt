# Nature versus Man
## 
### 
That 111:111 has not conquered nature is the
inexorable conclusion of the President's coin
missions on natural resources and Ihe Mis
sissippi valley. II is becoming clear to us :i 11
that man must shape his life to the irresistible
demands of nature; we must take what we
have an make the most of it.
Vistas of the perfections of El Dorado go
a-glinnnering with the incisive commentary
of the reports directed to Congress by the
President. America has 'botched badly, sug
gests Roosevelt in his primer on natural re
sources, and now must speed money after its
bolchings in a great effort to recover some of
the losses.
In the future we must build with eyes far
seeing into the future; the House, at least, lias
been persuaded of that fact to the tune of
nearly five billion dollars to be expended on
fifty dollar a month jobs. No doubt, subsist
ence at that level is better than no subsistence
at all, but we can only hope for better things,
when harmonious balance again is established
between man and his natural enemv, nature.
