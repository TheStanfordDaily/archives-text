World trade and the gold standard have again been
brought to the lore by the publishing of statistics pur
ported to prove that the gold bloc countries have main
tained both a higher quantum export index "and gold
value of exports during the depression years.
The gold value of total world exports for the first
half of last year was 66.5 per cent below that of 1929,
but the volume of these exports was only 24 per cent
below the 1929 level. Taking the gold value of exports
in 1929 as 100, the June 1934 value of American exports
was 23.8 per cent of the 1929 value; Great Britain's
32.7 per cent; and the gold bloc countries 37.3 per cent.
The countries adhering to the gold standard through
out the depression have suffered the smallest decrease
in their exports.
Quantum or volume figures of exports -\ppear
to substantiate this conclusion. Taking 1929 as a
base, we find that by the close of 1933 the quantity
of Great Britain's exports had fallen 35.8 per cent,
United States exports dropped 47.5 per cent by
volume, while the gold bloc countries fell only by
31 per cent and at the end of June 1934 by only
28.1 per cent.
"These export trade figures are significant certain
ly," says Dr. Theodore H. Boggs of the economics de
partment, "but must not be viewed in isolation. I think
that iron production, imports, bank clearings, unem
ployment and other criteria are perhaps more im
portant in ascertaining the prosperity of a country
than exports.
"When a country abandons the gold standard, it
can adopt a freer money and credit policy for the
central hanking institution, and resort to a mild,
controlled inflation, which usually brings with it
a business revival and rise of the price level.
"Great Britain abandoned gold in September 1931,
and a general resurgence of her economic life resulted
from* that time. United States forsook gold in the
spring of 1933, and the rest of the year prices rose and
business improved, while in such gold countries as
France and Germany, economic activity declined.
"Return to stabilization of leading monetary sys
tems is desirable, but if this step is taken prematurely,
it may he harmful. Great Britain and the United
States have succeeded in making monetary depreciation
an almost universal phenomenon in 1935, and the result
is that the net depreciation in any one country is rela
tively small.
"As the point of almost universal depreciation
is reached, we arc approaching the time when the
dollar, the pound, and other leading currencies may
look forward to stabilization on a new international
basis. World trade may then be financed on a
higher prjee level, which should in turn normally
serve as a stimulant to general economic revival."

World trade and the gold standard have again been

The gold value of total world exports for the first
half of last year was 66.5 per cent below that of 1929,
but the volume of these exports was only 24 per cent
below the 1929 level. Taking the gold value of exports
in 1929 as 100, the June 1934 value of American exports
was 23.8 per cent of the 1929 value; Great Britain's
32.7 per cent; and the gold bloc countries 37.3 per cent.
The countries adhering to the gold standard through
