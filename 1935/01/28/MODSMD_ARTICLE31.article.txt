# SWASTIKA OVER GERMANY

(In (his, (he first of a series of articles on Ger
many, our anonymous corresponded attempts (o
give us a view of the German attitude toward
Hitler. "Gemcinnutz vor Eigennutz" and its ap
plications . . .)
In order to understand just why conditions remain
as they are in Germany without a revolution, we must
first understand the attitude of the people toward Hitler
and his regime.
First of all, the Germans are not a cowed, brow
beaten people. They have always had a stolid sense
of loyalty to their country, and most of them main
tain it throughout the terrorism that from time to time
takes hold.
Germans do not consider Hitler dictator, hut
a leader. The difference between the two, they
(ell me, lies in the fart that a dictator is one who
sets himself up and makes the people like it. A
leader is one who sets himself up as a "dictator"
because the people have asked him to do so. he
cause they want a leader who does things he knows
(o he righ( even if the people don't! And one has
only to remember the soriologie-J principle that
what the society does is right if the members con
sider it right, to perhaps partially understand the
workings of the German mind these days.
Contrary to the opinion in foreign countries, there
are not great numbers of Germans against Hitler; and
it would be very simple to find out if there were such
numbers. "Certain things," says the government, "do
not concern the individual; they are a task for govern
ment." In other matters, it is possible for the German
to object to the government if he has a better sug
gestion to offer, but he is discouraged from crilici.sm
merely for the sake of criticizing.
Hitler is an idealist of the first water. Some of his
idealistic demands on the people (such as on the sub
ject of race) are so theoretical that the only way for
him to remain logically idealistic and to effect the
demands is to oblige people to accept them. Force in
this respect, becomes a means to carry out a high goal,
\as far as the German is concerned. And so with other
rather forceful acts of the German government.
The National Socialists (Nazis) have one great
principle, which can he traced %s the basis of most'
of their actions: "Gemeinnutz vor Eigennutz," or
"The Common Weal above Individual Weal." Con
sider this motto the next time yon read of some
radical action in Germany by the Nazis.
