# BULL SESSION
## PARDON MR. MOONEY 
### 
Mr. Thomas Mooney, once a hum
ble labor leader in San Francisco,
now a front-page martyr—is still in
San Quentin Prison.
Convicted 011 perjured testi
mony, Mooney has been held be
hind the walls of the State Peni
tentiary since 191(5 by "technicali
ties" and "pressure." The injustice
of his incarceration is so patent,
that it has aroused the condemna
tion of courts and investigating
committees all over the nation. To
the rest of the nation, Mooney is
innocent. In California, guilty or
innocent, he is in jail.
Now, after 18 years of San Quen
tin beans, Mr. Mooney is once more
being considered. And some of the
people who have screamed loudest
against him, are now suggesting that
Mooney be turned loose. They are
not, however, urging Mooney's free
dom on the basis of the man's inno
cence, but rather to rid themselves
of the "Free Tom Mooney" innoy
ance.
One San Francisco paper has
suggested that Mr. Mooney be
freed by "commutation" of his
sentence, in order to save the

] State of California the embarrass
ment of pardoning him—irnl thus
admitting that the great state had
done wrong.
I
That suggestion—which is likely
| to carry some weight, since it comes
from a man who has a hand on Gov
ernof Merriam's shoulder—can only
make California more ridiculous in
the eyes of the world. Is Mooney
guilty? Then what kind of a Slate is
J this where they consider letting
t guilty men—bombers—out of prison.
Is Mooney innocent? Then what kind
; of a State is this that will not rectify
a wrong in a clean-cut manner?
In California all things are pos
sible. In California there are the
greatest natural and human
anamolies. In California are more
suckers per square inch than in
any other state in the Union. In
California there are more slickers
per square inch. California lias 'v
reputation for being freakish. A
"commutation" for Mr. Mooney
would only add to a long list of
California curiosities.
On the other hand, California still
has a chance to save her face. Al
though it comes late, a pardon is still
in order. For California —sideshow
of the nation —to come out and admit
its gross error, and pardon Thomas
Mooney, would cast more glory on
the State than has come this way
in many years.
