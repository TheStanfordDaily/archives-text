The Editor, Sir:
There are many things that are
needed on this campus, hut one
thing that would be a big help to
the students would be some sort of
garage for the cars of men living in
Toyon or Branner. There are many
men that would be glad to pay a
rental of, say, $5 a quarter in order
to have their cars protected from the
weather. Why wouldn't it be pos
sible for the University to build some
garages to rent to these students?
Sincerely,
V.R.G.
