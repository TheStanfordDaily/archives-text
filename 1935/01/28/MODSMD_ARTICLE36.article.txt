# THE 						REVIEWER
## "LOTTERY LOVER" 
### 
At the Varsity
This is what is technically known
as a dud—a picture that should be
good but just misses. It has good
Comedy situations and good come
dians, fair music and fair musicians

— but poor di
rection and poor
production. ' It
could also have
stood a couple of
good women in
the cast instead
of Pat Patterson
and another in-

ept female. Lew Ayres is the lad
who is elected by lottery to woo
Madame Gaby Aimee, the famous
French star, and who finally wins
Miss Patterson. Sterling Holloway
coines through with much of the
comedy.
