# SIDELINE SLANTS
## FURNISH THRILLS WITH THEIR 143 POINTS 
### 
Like basketball? We recommend
the frosh over the varsity â€” their
games produce more excitement per
minute, and are much more satis
factory from the Stanford standpoint.
One hundred and forty-three
points in two games is the record
set by Coach Jimmy Bradshaw's
yearlings, and that happened in
the midst of pledging festivities
which claimed most of the squad.
A score of 70 to 16, such as that
Friday night against Galileo High
School, could happen; it may mean
an unusually "hut" winning team or
an unusually weak losing quintet.
But to repeat it with a vengeance,
73 to 24, on the following night, with
a pledge dance as an intermission,
designates a certain amount of class.
The shout that went up as the
70-mark was passed Saturday
evening could have been mistaken
for the roar of a few weeks ago,
when the Indian varsity won its
last conference game from U.S.C.
Hank Luisetti, smooth - passing
and dead-eye leader of the frosh
team, personally contributed 63
points during the two games. The
Babes looked much better Saturday
than they did against Galileo, and
would have added to their phenom
enal score, except that the tip-off,
which they got nearly every time on
Friday, was not in use against the
Santa Clara Bronco colts.
