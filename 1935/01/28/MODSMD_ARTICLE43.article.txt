# BASEBALL TEAM WON'T BE A HITTING CLUB
## 
### 
In its second showing of the year,
the Stanford baseball team was high
ly impressive, from a defensive
standpoint. Already, however, it ap
pears the Indians will not be a hit
ting club, and they will have to rely
on tight pitching and fielding to win
their bigger games from California
and Troy.
Only in tlie seventh inning
against a weakening pitcher did
Stanford show any hatting eye at
all. In that period of their game
with Al Earl's All-Stars, the Cards
scored five safeties to make their
only four runs of the contest.
Stanford now has three good, eli
gible pitchers, Al Semmelroth, Fred
Heringer, and Johnny Campbell; a
good, ineligible one who will be re
lieved from conference outlawry be
fore the season really gets going,
Stan Anderson, and a couple of oth
ers who may be good, but still have
to prove it.
"The scrum will have to improve,"
remarked Coach Harry Maloney just
after his Stanford rugby fifteen had
trounced — aye, trounced. — Clare
jnont in a Northern California Rugby
Union game, 54 to G, Saturday.
Maloney is highly pleased with
his hackfield's steady improve
ment in passing and running, hut
figures the present forward wall,
without a few finishing touches,
cannot compete with some of the
lines the sqirid will meet later in
the season.
The work of Jack Walton at full
back was a surprise Saturday. It
was the giant footballer's first at
tempt in the backfteld, and his play,
though hardly superlative, showed
potentiality. Johnny Reisner and Joe
Vignay were still big shots of the
passing and running department, and
Ray «Lewis did many things and
made many points, 30 in all, with his
kicking and running. *■
