Displaying a brand of basketball
| (hat had spectators on their toes and
opponents baffled, Stanford's frosh
! hoop team ran rampant Friday night
over Galileo High School, 70-1.6. and
then came back to repeat their per
' formance Saturday night against
Santa Clara frosh, downing them 73-
; 24. Santa Clara and Galileo were the
I only two teams to defeat last year's
j frosh squad.
Hank Luisetti, playing sensa
tional hall in both games, took high
! scoring honors. Luisetti made 29
points Friday night during three
quarters of play and tallied 34
points Saturday to run up a total
j of 63 digits scored in the two
i games.
Clarence Maurer, who has been
j improving rapidly since early sea
j son, scored 10 points during the one
j half of the Galileo game, and then
j made an even better showing Satur
[ day night in tallying 24 points.
Against Galileo the Stanford first—
I string took an early lead and made
i the score 36-8 at the half. Coach
I Jimmie Bradshaw gave some of his
I second-stringers a chance in the sec
| ond half and the reserves failed by
j only two points to double the half
i time score. Bill Hulbert, substitute
■ forward, showed well during the lat
' ter period, scoring eight points for
the local frosh.
Fast Break Counts
Saturday, against a stronger squad,
Stanford again hit its pace. Brad
shaw played his first team the entire
game, with the exception of Bob
( Zonne, who went out in the last min
j ute of play on fouls.
Their quick break, with H. B. Lee
! and Nelly Heath, guards, successful
ly recovering and passing the bail
down to Maurer or Luisetti seldom
failed to net a basket. At half time
the papoose quintet led 29-9 and they
boosted this score to 73-24 before the
i game had ended.
Last night Bradshaw accounted for
his team's remarkable showing by
| saying, "They were just hot." He ex
plained that, had the boys been "off"
over the week-end, the scores might
have been considerably changed.
Next Friday and Saturday nights
the frosh play California frosh and
i Berkeley High School in the Pa
j vilion. Bradshaw is planning to
| concentrate during the week's prac
tice sessions on offensive play.

over the week-end, the scores might
have been considerably changed.
Next Friday and Saturday nights
the frosh play California frosh and
i Berkeley High School in the Pa
j vilion. Bradshaw is planning to
| concentrate during the week's prac
tice sessions on offensive play.
Displaying a brand of basketball
| (hat had spectators on their toes and
opponents baffled, Stanford's frosh
! hoop team ran rampant Friday night
over Galileo High School, 70-1.6. and
then came back to repeat their per
' formance Saturday night against
Santa Clara frosh, downing them 73-
; 24. Santa Clara and Galileo were the
I only two teams to defeat last year's
j frosh squad.
Hank Luisetti, playing sensa
tional hall in both games, took high
! scoring honors. Luisetti made 29
points Friday night during three
quarters of play and tallied 34
points Saturday to run up a total
j of 63 digits scored in the two
i games.
Clarence Maurer, who has been
j improving rapidly since early sea
j son, scored 10 points during the one
j half of the Galileo game, and then
j made an even better showing Satur
[ day night in tallying 24 points.
Against Galileo the Stanford first—
I string took an early lead and made
i the score 36-8 at the half. Coach
I Jimmie Bradshaw gave some of his
I second-stringers a chance in the sec
| ond half and the reserves failed by
j only two points to double the half
i time score. Bill Hulbert, substitute
■ forward, showed well during the lat
' ter period, scoring eight points for
the local frosh.
Fast Break Counts
Saturday, against a stronger squad,
Stanford again hit its pace. Brad
shaw played his first team the entire
game, with the exception of Bob
( Zonne, who went out in the last min
j ute of play on fouls.
Their quick break, with H. B. Lee
! and Nelly Heath, guards, successful
ly recovering and passing the bail
down to Maurer or Luisetti seldom
failed to net a basket. At half time
the papoose quintet led 29-9 and they
boosted this score to 73-24 before the
i game had ended.
Last night Bradshaw accounted for
his team's remarkable showing by
| saying, "They were just hot." He ex
plained that, had the boys been "off"
over the week-end, the scores might
have been considerably changed.
