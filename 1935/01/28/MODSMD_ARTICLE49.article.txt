# INDIAN RUGGERS DEFEAT CLAREMONT, SCORE 54-6
## 
### WARREN BREED 
The Cardinal ruggers were hot
Saturday and defeated Claremont,
54-6. Ray Lewis was the chief scor
er, with 30 points to his credit, four
tries (touchdowns) and nine con
verts helping to count for the big
gest rugger score in years.
Lewis, Johnny Reisner, and Fred
Abbott were good as usual, but the
play of Tony Cockins and Jim Trom
pas, two boys new to Indian sports,
was the news of the day. Cockins and
Trompas had been going great guns
in workouts all week, but flashed
brilliantly Saturday with baffling
speed and shifty hips that com
pletely crossed up the transbay out
fit.
Lewis Abbott, Reisner, and
Dick Morrison, frmit rank man,
scored tries in the first half. Lewis
missed the last two converts,
coming at impossible angles from
the goal-posts.
Starting the second half with 21

I points, Captain Roger Hager's boys '
I crossed the line seven times, Lewis I
| converting all but one, and even that j
1 one hit the goal-posts. Lewis scored j
! three, Trompas two, and Reisner and !
Vigna one apiece.
Lewis' bit of legitimate pilfer
-1 ing late in the fray was the best
I single shot of the day. The Clare
mont fullback was holding the ball
' preparing to kick it, when tore
I up, snatched the pigskin, and side
| stepped three tacklers to cross the f
i line.
The Redshirts got the advantage by j
strong pushing in the scrum, con- j
sistently heeling the ball out to,
Cockins, who would pass it on for a j
new rush down the field. Jack:
Walton enjoyed the game from his >
new prone-fullback post.
At Santa Rosa the Stanford second
team outclassed the Santa RoSa Jay
sees, 37-7. John Merritt scored
three times, and Harry Goff two.
