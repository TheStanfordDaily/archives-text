Though the absence of most of the
I squad made it impossible for all
! events to be run off, Coach Dink
Templeton's 1935 track team went
through the customary meet last Fri
day afternoon with no surprises and
few notable marks.
Al Blackman's 49.5 seconds quar
ter-mile lead the performances,
making Black mi n eligible for the
second squad swtM suit awarded to
men attaining a given mark in their
events, as according to Templeton's
new system. Phil Levy became the
third man later in the afternoon, with
a winning discus toss of 150 feet.
John Mottram had previously be
come the first with a mark of 197

The only other good early season
mark was registered by Dave Dev
lin, diminutive distance runner, with
a mark of 10 minutes, seven seconds
in the two mile.
