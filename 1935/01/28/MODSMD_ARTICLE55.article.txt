# 'Dink' Replies To Jacobs' Chargeâ€” 'Too Ridiculous'
## 
### 
"Too ridiculous to even consider,"
is the way Dink Templeton, Stanford
track coach, branded the charges of
John Jacobs, Oklahoma track men
tor, to the effect that Templeton had
done the "worst bit of proselyting I
have ever heard of."
An Associated Press story Satur
day carried Jacobs' bitter denuncia
tion of Templeton, which claimed
that he had "tried to get Orville
Matthews from us." Jacobs made
many other charges concerning
Dink's tactics.
Has Agreement
"I'd never heard of Matthews be
fore a month ago," Dink said. "I've
never contacted him, and I never
even looked up his record to see how
good h e i s -"
From a sick bed in the Palo Alto
Hospital, where he is suffering from
abdominal influenza, Templeton ex
plained lhat he has an agreement
with Brutus Hamilton, California
coach, that neither shall do any
proselyting of athletes. This agree
ment, he said, even goes beyond the
conference rules.
Matthews Denies Charge
"I've never contacted athletes for
the purpose of interesting them in
coming to Stanford, and have not
even answered any letters from prep
school stars," Dink went on.
"Besides," he finished, "I under
stand Matthews has already signed a
scholarship to U.S.C."
Contacted by the Associated Press,
Matthews yesterday remarked: "The
coach at Stanford has never talked
to me about enrolling there, nor has
Coach Jacobs made any direct re
quest that I come to Norman . . .
Some of the alumni of both have
been asking me to enroll."
