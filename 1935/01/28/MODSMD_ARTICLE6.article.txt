Fraternity men, some of them at
least, slept their first good night's
sleep in several weeks last night.
Some 288 freshmen and transfers,
those of them who had come out of
the daze known as the x*ushing
whirl, also grabbed some undisturbed
sleep for a change.
Bull sessions themed with ''Swell
guy, pledge him up," or '"Let's get
off the dime with this boy; he's a
nugget," were junked for the re
mainder of the year Friday as the
record class of neophytes trekked
up the row and distributed itself
about 24 men's Greek letter or
ganizations to partake ot pledge
night festivities.
So now things are back to normal
and everyone is calmly happy—row
men, frosh, and even Interfraternity
Council President George Cobb, who
recorded himself as pleased with the
manner of rushing during the 1934-
35 scramble.
The dazed freshmen, struck by
rushing early last fall, were given no
chance to recover until they awak
ened Saturday morning with nothing
left but the cleaning up.
After signing with the fraternity
lawyer in Encina, the yearling nug

rooms of the Women's Gymnasium
during the evening, making it the
big one of the year for the Farm.

off the dime with this boy; he's a
nugget," were junked for the re
mainder of the year Friday as the
record class of neophytes trekked
up the row and distributed itself
about 24 men's Greek letter or
ganizations to partake ot pledge
night festivities.
So now things are back to normal
and everyone is calmly happy—row
men, frosh, and even Interfraternity
Council President George Cobb, who
recorded himself as pleased with the
manner of rushing during the 1934-
35 scramble.
The dazed freshmen, struck by
rushing early last fall, were given no
chance to recover until they awak
ened Saturday morning with nothing
left but the cleaning up.
After signing with the fraternity
lawyer in Encina, the yearling nug
gets hastened toward their chosen
houses to be greeted. Most of
them came back again for dinner
and a banquet of greeting, and
then entered the melee annuijly
known as the Pledge Dance.
A thousand couples, it was esti
mated, circulated through the two
rooms of the Women's Gymnasium
during the evening, making it the
big one of the year for the Farm.
This year's class generally ap
proached a mean, and every house
took a fair-sized group. Phi Delta
Theta again led the procession from
the number standpoint with 17. This
ranged on down to six.
Numbers pledged by other houses
follow: Phi Gamma Delta, Sigma Nu,
and Chi Psi, 16; Phi Kappa Psi, Delta
Tau Delta, and Zeta Psi, 15; Delta
Upsilon and Alpha Tau Omega, 14;
Theta Xi and Sigma Chi, 13; Sigma
Alpha Epsilon, Kappa Sigma, and
Kappa Alpha, 12; Alpha Delta Phi,
Delta Kappa Epsilon, and Beta Theta

Chi, 9; Delta Chi, 8; Alpha Kappa

Fraternity men, some of them at
least, slept their first good night's
sleep in several weeks last night.
Some 288 freshmen and transfers,
those of them who had come out of
the daze known as the x*ushing
whirl, also grabbed some undisturbed
sleep for a change.
