THE BALLET RUSSE DE MONTE
CARLO — At the War Memorial
Opera House (S.E.)
With last night's performance of [
the Ballet Russe, San Francisco's i
first season of the ballet since 191H j
came to a close. It was the city's first j
opportunity to discover for itself the ,
delights of this unusual group which j
has been thrilling New York audi- .
ences for the past year.
It might be that much of the exotic ;
flavor of the performances arose'
from the glamour of the Ballet's his- |
torv. For it is a direct descendant of j
the Czar's Imperial Russian Ballet—
the superlative of all like groups. The |
rigors of its training and the bril- I
liance of the performances have been j
vividly told in the biography of
Nijinsky, foremost artist of the j
troupe previous to the 1917 Revo- j
lution. In those days, every member |
was an'individual artist, who, how-!
ever, when once he left to go into |
the world, was never permitted to j
return.
Thrust into the world itself, after !
losing its Royal sponsor, the Ballet i
lost much of its classical background. '
Modern realism and impressionism ]
and an appeal to republican tastes
has taken the place of stern training
in traditional forms. For example, in |
Le Tricorne we find costumes and j
sets designed by such a famous mod
ernist as Picasso. In the same ballet, ;
Martinez Sierra adapts the fable and '
uses music of Manuel de Fa 11a. Leon j
Bakst, Andre Derain, and Massine j
are other moderns whose work has J
been incorporated into the produc
tions.
The result is a colorful, objective ;
pageant of synchronized movement, j
American audiences, whose experi
ence. with theatrical expression has ;
j been mostly limited to the drama or
i opera, will find themselves surprised
j that such complete and dramatic plot
j and emotional climax can be created
j without the use of song or spoken
I word. Extraordinarily expressive
| bodily movements clearly define un
i usual characters, and involved chor- j
I eography and pantomimic action
! conveys a complete range of emo- j
tional narrative.
The superb artistry and technique j
| of the dancers, the color of sets and |
I costumes, the skill of the choreogra- |
phy, and the lovely music were ail
combined to make brilliantly differ
ent entertainment, bound to appeal I
even to the least-informed initiate.
