## Christian Science Monitor Correspondent Tells Of Soviet Russia REPORTS NEW TRENDS Discusses Recent Activities In Moscow Affairs 
### Barbara Sweet 
William H. Chamberlin, former
Moscow correspondent for the Chris
tian Science Monitor, will speak to
night at 7:30 o'clock in the Assembly
Hall on "Ten Years-in Soviet Russia."
This lecture, sponsored by the Com
mittee on Public Exercises, will be an
outstanding event on the Tuesday
Evening Series. #
Two new trends in Soviet life per
ceived by Chamberlin during his
extensive trips throughout Russia
were an increasing nationalism and
growing inequality. There is a sys
tematic effort in the Soviet newspa
pers to arouse national pride in any
new achievement in industry, sci
ence, or exploration.
The propaganda for international
revolution has temporarily been
pushed into the background, ac
cording to the correspondent, al
though there is no reason to be
lieve that it has been finally aban
doned. As regards inequality,
Communist propaganda today is
constantly stressing the virtues of
payment by piecework and the ne
cessity for paying more to the more
skilled and capable.
The Soviet Union, Chamberlin be
lieves, is anxious to cultivate
friendly relations with America,
partly because it hopes to enlist
American co-operation if it be
comes involved with Japan in the
Far East, partly because it hopes to
push forward its industrial develop
ment with the aid of American cap
ital.
While there are some indications
of easier material conditions in Rus
sia, according to Chamberlin, there
is no indication that the iron grip of
the Communist dictatorship, incar
nated in Stalin, who wields the same
absolute power in Russia as Hitler in
Germany or Mussolini in Italy, is re
laxing. The recent shooting of (iG
persons after what seems to have
been a very brief and sketchy "trial,"
following the mysterious murder of
the prominent Communist, Kirov,
shows that terrorism remains a fun
damental characteristic of Soviet ad
ministration.
