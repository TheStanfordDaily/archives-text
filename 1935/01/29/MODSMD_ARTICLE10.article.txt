SACRAMENTO, Jan. 28. —In a
move termed by a San Francisco
new.spapcr as an attempt to keep
the newspapers from "printing what
happens al the trial," Defense Attor
ney Leo Gallagher on Friday after
! noon asked the citation of Bert
Vaughn, reporter for the Sacramento
Bee, for contempt of court. At the
i time the motion was made the jury
! was out for the afternoon recess, and
j court was held for the purpose of
1 Gallagher's motion.
! Gallagher based his motion on a
i headline in the Bee's first edition, on
' the streets at noon, of a story con
! taining quotations from evidence
j l ead into the court record that morn-
I ing. Claiming that the headline was
' misleading and fallacious, he asked
I Vaughn's citation. Vaughn's story,
; which he was not called on to tell
the court, was that he rushed his
j copy over at the last possible minute
and someone in the office wrote the
j heads, usually without reading be
yond the fust paragraph.

Presiding Judge Dal M. Lemmon
informed the defense that the court
would consider the motion, and had
scarcely finished speaking when
Prosecutor Mac Al lister leaped to his
feet and requested the citation of the
Western Worker's report on the same
charges. This move came as a sur
prise to the Western Worker corre
spondent, who, turning to the press
table, explained: "Well, I just wire
the facts and the paper writes it up."
In this case the prosecution objected
I to a headline declaring: "Frame-Up
j Trial in Sacramento."
Again Judge Lemmon stated the
court would look into the matter at
its leisure, and, as both attorneys
appeared rather dissatisfied, took the
opportunity to remark: "Counsel has
not assisted the court, but has tried
\ to capitalize on everything. The main
trouble has been counsel."
With these words a general recess
began, and a tired jury standing ex
pectantly in the corridor knew noth
i ing of the cause of the delay.
