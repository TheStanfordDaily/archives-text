# WINTERS READS VERSE OVER KGO
## Poems of Bridges, Baker Interpreted Over Air 
### 
Dr. Yvor Winters illustrated the j
qualities of seriousness, accuracy,!
and power which he believes neces- |
sary to poetry by reading two poems j
to the Stanford Hour radio audience j
over station KGO at 8 o'clock last j
night. !
The first, entitled "The Affliction i
of Richard," was by Richard
Bridges, the late poet laureate of
England, and is a devotional poem |
by a man who is genuinely re
signed to the modern scepticism be !
has experienced.
The second poet was chosen by |
Winters because he believes Mr. '
Howard Baker of Berkeley to be the |
finest poet to write in English since j
Bridges, and in all essential respects j
to resemble him.
The poem by Mr. Baker is entitled
"Destiny: An Ode," and its subject;
is serious and contemporary, its or- j
ganization skillful, and its details are i
beautiful. The inspiration of the i
poem was the author's view of the I
San Francisco Bay from his home, a |
view which bears an implicit sug
gestion of moral and intellectual per- j
spective.
"The essential virtues of poetry |
can be very briefly defined, but can
never be fully explained," stated Dr. ;
Winters. "Poetry, like life, can be j
formulated . . . Yet poetry, like life, i
exceeds formulation, for there is al- j
ways a content of quality, of feel- .
ing, which no formula will contain. '
This is why poetry has a life of its
own, distinct from all formulation."
Dr. Winters continued: "Like the
other forms of literature, poetry is
an experience of a good deal of com
plexity; it is an experience both
intellectual and emotional; it is an <
experience in which a motive is de- j
fined and the resultant feeling is!
evaluated, and in which the two |
processes are simultaneous, interpre- !
lative, and inseparable."
