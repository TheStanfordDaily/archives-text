### 
Dr. Robert F. Arnold, who will be I
j acting professor of German during
I the summer quarter, comes from Ihe j
j University of Vienna, where he has
• been since 1!)00.
j The Viennese philologist studied in
j Vienna and Berlin, and traveled ex-
I tensively to gain a knowledge of the
! languages before taking his position
at the University as a privattdozent,
i After six years in this position, he
was made a professor.
One of the outstanding features of
Dr. Arnold's work at the University
of Vienna was his weekly informal
! meetings with his students in a cof
fee house. He has continued to meet
j hie students in this way for 26 years.
It is expected and hoped by those '
' interested in German that Dr. Arnold \
will continue this practice next sum
l mer when he begins his professor- ■
shin at Stanford.
