# Licenses Given To Menlo Park Liquor Dealers
## Granted in Anticipation of Passing Bill Modifying Present Law Which Prohibits Sale Within Mile And A Half of Stanford Ad Building DIRECTLY OPPOSES SUPREME COURT RULING Controversy Between University Officials and State Board Of Equalization May Begin Again 
### HERB DIAMOND 
Pending final action upon a liill which would modify (lie present liquor
sales Liw, and upon permission of the Attorney General's office, approxi
mately 17 liquor dealers in Menlo Park have been granted sales licenses
for I!K{5.

Assemblyman J. P. Gilmorc of San Francisco recently introduced the
bill in the State Assembly proposing to amend the present milc-and-a-half
—♦sales limit to include only the dis
trict within one mile of the Univer
sity Administration Building. The
granting of the 1935 licenses to the
Menlo Park dealers is in direct op
position to last year's Supreme Court
ruling naming the mile and a half
limit, but if the present bill passes,
Menlo Park would be placed outside
the restricted area.
Menlo Advocates Bill
Jean Hoss, secretary of the Menlo
Park Business Assoeiation, stated
last night that Menlo Park was
"through fighting" for the adoption
of the proposed amendment, ex
plaining that on a recent trip to
Sacramento the new amendment was
assured the support of at least 70
per cent of tne legislative body.
Hoss further added that if the pro
posed amendment is defeated, the
border line liquor sales would lie in
"no man's land" directly between
Menlo Park and Atherton, which is
unincorporated territory. Saloons
and illegal establishments would
rapidly spring up in this territory
lacking local government, redupli
cating conditions prevalent in Menlo
Park 25 years ago, before the town
ship was incorporated. Hoss pointed
out that the mile-and-a-half liquor
sales limit was first put into use at
that time, when there was need for it.
Another Fight Expected
! Tlie controversy between Univer
sity officials and the State Board of
Equalization, through which the
sales licenses were issued, will in
evitably reopen as a result of the
granting of the permits. Both Presi
dent Ray Lyman Wilbur and Comp
troller Almon E. Roth were unable to
be reached last night for statements
regarding their stand on the present
liquor situation. Stanford attorneys,
however, have defined the sales lim
its from which the distance is to be
measured identical with those ac
cepted by the Stanford Board of
Trustees in 1918.
