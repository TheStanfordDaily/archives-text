## 
### 
When 6 o'clock tomorrow morning
arrives, Stanford's varsity debate
team will have started on seven
week transcontinental tour with
Fred Bold, Andrew Bright, Robert
Grantier, and Pack McFarland on
their way for 50 debates with 40 uni
versities throughout the country.
Not only will the debaters travel
into diversified sections of the
country, ,ranging from the Rocky
Mountain colleges to the staid and
old universities on the Atlantic sea
board and the old south, but their
audiences will be of all sorts and
kinds, thus making for greater ver
satility in the ability of the men as
debaters.
In Denver, for example, they have
four debates: one before a university
group; another before a church con
gregation; one before units of Work
ers Educational classes, and still an
other at a high school assembly.
With respect to this selection of au
diences, Robert Gros, debate man
ager, said: "We have made the
schedule as diversified as possible to
allow the debaters to speak in varied
sections of the country, and also
before unusual audiences. Coach Lee
Chapin feels that such training as
this will make more versatile and
able debaters than by following the
usual routine of debates."
The four men are dividing into
two teams, Bright and Bold forming
one, and Grantier and McFarland,
the other. The first debate will bring
Bright and Bold to a verbal clash
against the University of Nevada at
Reno tomorrow night.
