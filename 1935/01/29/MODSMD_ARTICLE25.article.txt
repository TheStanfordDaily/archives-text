# BRUNO NEARLY BREAKS UNDER TRIAL'S ORDEAL
## Shouts "Stop That" At Cross-Examination By Wilentz COURTROOM HOSTILE Seems Near Confession At Times 
### 
FLEMINGTON, N.J., Jan. 28 (/!>). —
Bruno Haujatmann, wilting under a
driving cross - examination, fought
today with desperate, stumbling
words from the witness stand of his
trial for murdering the Lindbergh
baby.
Accused of lies, he twice cried:
"Stop that!" at his inquisitor, the
determined Attorney General Dav
id T. Wilentz.
Throughout the ordeal Haupt
mann, perspiring, white-faced, and
often faltering, insisted he was in
nocent of the kidnaping, the baby's
murder, and the cruel ransom hoax.
The atmosphere of the old court
room was plainly antipathetic to the
pale German carpenter, but he seem
ed in nowise aware of the undercur
rent of hostility and the palpable
circus effects injected by the visiting
celebrities and out-of-towners, gay
tittering—the women in mink coats,
the men a wise-cracking lot.
There were times when he seemed
on the ,brink of an admission that
would settle definitely the question
of his guilt in the minds of the eight
men and four women jurors who sat
through the long day listening
tensely to the unbroken interroga
tion.
Caught in Maze
It was Mrs. Hauptmann's hardest
day since the trial began. Her hus
band caught himself in a maze of
contradictions, and repeatedly ad
mitted he had lied.
The name of blonde Breta Henckel,
who shared his regard, rang on her
ears, and the repeated phrase about
| money: "I did not tell my wife."
But she greeted him with a smile
when he came down from the wit
ness stand and she leaned over to
talk to him.
Mrs. Hauptmann, who leaped to
her feet earlier in the trial and told
a witness "Mrs. Achenbach, you are
lying!" listened quietly to her hus
band's admissions.
