# Menlo Park Mite and a Half?
## 
### 
The wholesale exodus of Mcnlo Park liquor
dealers threatened last fall has suddenly done
an about face as a result of the granting of 17
pennils for 1935 to dealers in the neighboring
oasis.

Last November the Supreme (-onrt ruled
lluil Ilk' Hoard of Equalization was to cancel
llie permit issued to a pharmacy in Mayfield
because the estiih.lishment fell within the
mile and a half limit prescribed by state law.
A I that time il was decided that "the distance
is to be measured from the campus limit and
by a direct and straight line."
Since most of the Menlo "thirst parlors"
are clearly within this limit, the ruling was
interpreted as the death-knell of the town's
principal industry. Now comes the Stale
Hoard of Equalization, whose methods and
decisions are strange and wondrous to behold,
and grants 17 permits in apparent defiance of
the purpose of the Supreme Court ruling. The
Hoard of Equalization seems to have its own
idea as to who is the highest judicial author
ity in the State.
Searching around I'o.r the well-known col
ored gentleman in the pile of wood, one finds
that the liquor association of Menlo and the
Hoard of Equalization base their action on a
pending legislative bill which would legalize
the sale of liquor, so long as the establishment
was more than a mile away from the admin
istration building of the university involved.
Thus, if the bill passes, Menlo's dealers are
safe. If is does not pass, they must move.
Menlo Hark interests hope the bill will become
law; Stanford University officials will doubt
less oppose it. And so the battle, apparently
settled last November, rages once more.
