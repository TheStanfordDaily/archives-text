Europe is now "arming" for another of ils
interminable peace conferences which invar
iably end as the diplomats quarrel, throw up
their hands, and go home. II is the French
and the British who are about to begin the
hostilities now; Thursday they will gather
about a table in Downing Street and begin
the quibbling, which this time will concern
the problem of what to do with Germany.
The week also marks the end of the second
year of the Nazi dictatorship which is founded
on Herr Hitler's solemn promise to see that
Germany regains her "place in the sun" that
was lost in 1918. Therein lies the problem;
Kerr Hitler is averse to consummating any
peaceful agreement which would prevent him
from silting comfortable ;il home maintaining
prestige among his peoples by the simple ex
pedient of glaring malevolently across the
Bhine and occasionally thumbing his nose at
(leneva.
Franco and Great Britain are industriously
attempting to maneuver this enfant terrible
into a less threatening position. The goal they
agree upon; but they are at loggerheads over
Ihe means. The British want Hitler to bring
back his toys and play in the League's back
yard, but the French are unwilling to pay
the price he demands for this gestureâ€”com
plete equality of armaments between the two
nations.
The consultants over the green tables of
Downing Street will feel, no doubt, that if this
mad dog of the Reich cannot be muzzled by
a peace pact, he must be caged by a ring of
steel, Ihe same enclosure that Kaiser Wilhelm
swore prompted him to battle in 1914.
So, history repeats itself; what avail is it
to fight wars or to win them, when, before
twenty years have passed, their political ef
fects are nullified? France was demolished in
LS7O, and fifty years later returned the com
pliment to her ravishcrs.
The score now stands at horse-and-horsc
between the gamblers, but who will win the
rubber game?
