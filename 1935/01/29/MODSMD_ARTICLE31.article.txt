# A 						Permanent Men's Rest Home
## 
### 
One of the finest things the Mothers' Club
has done for the students on this campus has
been to provide and maintain the Best Homes
for those not feeling suflieicnlly ill to pay
the hospital a visit, but who neverlhcless need
a good rest for a period.
The Women's Best Home is set up per
manently on the campus, but the Men's Best
Home has been tossed about like an unwanted
infant, from Palo Alio to the campus and
back.
This year, fortunately, i! spends the season
on the Farm in a very quiet and lovely spot.
Bui next year, again, it must be oil and move
lo newer grounds. The reason? It is leased
from some partv who would like to have his

own home hack when he returns to the cam
pus. No blame there.
How's for an idea from somebody?
Wanted â€”a means of securing a permanent
Men's Rest Home that will be located on the
campus and stay here.
