State constitutions are not what one would call
really interesting reading, nor does their length lend
merit or efficiency, yet California holds second place
in the U.S. ranking of long state constitutions and has
three times turned down provisions to revise the un
wieldy document.
At the last state election the people voted to hold a
constitutional convention and make more useable the
present set of laws.
E. A. Cottrell, professor of political science, com
mends the action which will begin soon and explains
why: "The trouble with the present constitution is that
they have included so much in it that is really statute
law. The legislature is limited so much by the con
stitution as it now operates that it has practically no
power. So much must be referred to (he people. This
takes time. With economic changes becoming so rapid,
a legislature meeting every second year cannot fit taxes
to current economic situations," he says.
A constitutional commission after extensive work
reported to Governor Young in 1930 what should be
changed in the constitution and what should be in
cluded in a new one. They approved a single house
legislature but did not tackle the job of trying to put
it into the new constitution because they felt it would
be too radical a change. The change should be more
gradual, they decided. Their greatest contribution to
the coming revision was the emphasis they placed on
simplifying the document.
"They condensed 30 pages on local government into
five pages," Cottrell says, "not by changing the content
but just by better, more general language."
With the work of this commission as a background
California has a fine foundation for the constitutional
convention.
Very soon now the legislature will call for election
of convention delegates. It means that members will
be elected to the group on the same basis as legislature
representatives, that is, by counties. The political sci
ence authority does not favor this plan. He believes that
with representatives elected by districts and a few at
large, the state would be able to secure the aid of
"big men of lax'ge cities" who do not care to campaign
for the position, or cannot be elected on the county
plan because their following is not widespread enough.
However, the method of electing delegates is all
decided and California will have to use the brains of
her really "big" men by unofficial capacity.

legislature but did not tackle the job of trying to put
it into the new constitution because they felt it would
be too radical a change. The change should be more
gradual, they decided. Their greatest contribution to
the coming revision was the emphasis they placed on
simplifying the document.
"They condensed 30 pages on local government into
five pages," Cottrell says, "not by changing the content
but just by better, more general language."
With the work of this commission as a background
California has a fine foundation for the constitutional
convention.
Very soon now the legislature will call for election
of convention delegates. It means that members will
be elected to the group on the same basis as legislature
representatives, that is, by counties. The political sci
ence authority does not favor this plan. He believes that
with representatives elected by districts and a few at
large, the state would be able to secure the aid of
"big men of lax'ge cities" who do not care to campaign
for the position, or cannot be elected on the county
plan because their following is not widespread enough.
However, the method of electing delegates is all
decided and California will have to use the brains of
her really "big" men by unofficial capacity.
