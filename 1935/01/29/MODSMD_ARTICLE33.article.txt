German elections—yes and no matters with
little choice to the voter—what is the ctiizen's atti
tude toward them? How German boys and girt*
are trained to fall into line . . .
Germans don't mind the way elections are carried
cn. While the rest of the world clucks with pity at the
antics of the Reich in holding "yes and no" elections,
the German citizen has his own ideas.
"In the New Germany," they slyly explain,
"elections are yes and no matters, not an opportu
nity for the voter to express his dislike of the
candidate's face or his disapproval of the poli
tician's necktie." This, they maintain, is the basis
of elections in the United States.
Another minor point about elections in the Third
Reich is the splendid co-operation of the school children
with Hitler. While older folk may at times disagree
wilh the method of carrying out measures directed by
the Fuehrer, the children are 100 per cent for his
policies. The reason is simple:
Almost all the children in German schools be
long either to the Hitler youth (boys) or to the
Bund Deutscher Mredcl (girls). Those of the
youngsters who are not members (and there arc a
few) must stay in school on Saturdays, while those
who arc members of the organizations are free to
play. The objectors are forced to do arithmetic
and spelling, interspersed with government-pro
duced lectures on the state and its principles.
College education for all may be the object of
American plans, but Germans see little use for it.
They agree that there is only room for a certain per
centage of specially trained professional men, and that
all those in other countries who are trained for pro
fessions will not be able to practice them. So why,
they ask, prepare many for lives which can be led
only by a few?
