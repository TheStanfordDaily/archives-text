# OUR HASHER SEZ:

### 
When the guns had ceased filing, the rockets had
ceased glaring, *and the Fords had got the men away
from the wenches by Christmas and 2:30, the many
aching heads up the Row got together to decide who
won the war. ♦
A box score reveals this: The Zetcs thought the
"Z-P Club" won, the Phi Delts thought "Weedy's
Hash House" won, the Alpha Delts thought the "I De
fys" won, the Dekes thought the "El Toroble Club"
won, the Chi Psis thought "The House of Chipso
Soapso" won, the D U's thought they won. D U?
There wasn't a Sigma Nu who could be reached for a
statement. The boys had been too busy "Reaching for
the Moon—and you."
The next event on the calendar is the Lagunita
Formal. "Use Dr. Blotto's Slzler pills for headaches."
If those $&%*! frogs in Lake Lagunita dun't quit
purring there won't be a Lagunitaite (and friend) who
can hear the orchestra. Ever since the lake filled up,
the campus has been as noisy at nights as an Ex Com
mittee meeting. All the farm boys that came from
Sioux City think they're back home again and can got
to sleep easily, while the boys from the big cities
think the street cars are going by, and can likewise get
to sleep easily, but me, I'm from Los Angeles, and the
noise bothers me. The only noise in Los Angeles at
nights is the sound of the real estate booms collapsing.
As a matter of fact, I come from Salinas, where on
many a still night there can be heard the sound of the
lettuce crooning its little ones to sleep.
In Palo Alto, you can hear the cops scratching out
tickets.
Up in Roble, there is a quite ancient custom, that
girls are virtuous when they get in by 2:30 five times
a quarter, and Iwice on week-ends, and once in the
middle of the week, and so forth, and 1 hope you can
figure it out. It. happened, however, that one girl did
not "turn backward, turn backward the time in its
flight, or make me a child again, just for tonight."
In short, she got a lockout. On the lockout slip,
the sly young miss explained in just four words: "Lost
in a fog."
Coming soon: "Dave MellinkofT, Ihe Frenzy of the
People." Also selected short subjects.
