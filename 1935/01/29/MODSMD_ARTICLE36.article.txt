"FORSAKING ALL OTHERS"
At the Stanford Theatre
The average shop-girl and Stan
ford student will consider this film
entertaining sophistication.- But the
Reviewer mounts the wrong side of
his rocking-horse thus morning and

dccides that the
flinging around
of country es
tates, ron s -
Hoyce roadsters,
Swedish ma s -
seuses, and hus
bands, is not only
a vulgar display

in very bad taste, but is, as well,
thoroughly un-American and Re
publican in its old-fashioned opti
mism.
The plot has to do with a rich girl
and two rich men. She is engaged
to one of them twice (Montgomery),
but pulls what is meant to be a sur
prise ending by marrying the other
(Gable). Crawford seems uncom
fortable as a comedienne; Gable is
out of place as the devil-may-care,
but I-love-you-truly playboy; and
Montgomery hasn't changed a bit
since the last time you saw him.
Director Van Dyke's fast pace, Char
lie Butterworth, and a few lines are
all that save this film. Amusing se
quence: Butterworth en *pute to a
swank reception with flowers, bal
loons, bags of peanuts, and a monkey
and hand-organ. —Brill
