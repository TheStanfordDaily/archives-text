# ONE SIDE OF IT

### RICHARD W. DICKENSON 
A vigorous effort is now being made to force the United States into
that adjunct oi the League of Nations known as the Permanent .Court of ,
International Justice or the World Court. It is hard to understand that i
the United States Senate will vote for adherence to that League Court in
ciefiance of the wishes of the American people and contrary to the long
established American policies of non-interference in purly European affairs ;
and a peaceful settlement of international disputes by arbitration.
There is no present need for a World Court. Arbitration is the better
method of settling international disputes. Arbitration is judicial settlement.
Arbitration lias proved to be a satisfactory method of settling dis
putes. The most recent case involving the United States was the dis
pute with Canada over the "I'm Alone," a rum-runner sunk by the
Coast Guard in 1929; this dispute was referred to Chief Justice Dull'
of Canada, and Associate Justice Van Dev°nter of the United States
Supreme Court, who recently announced their findings.
The United States, moreover, along with 44 other nations, is a member
of the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague, which was organized
in 1901 as a result of the Hague Conference of 1899. This court consists of
a panel of men distinguished in international law. Each nation nominates
four men. 'Hien, when a dispute arises, the two governments select five
persons from this tribunal, three of whom must be neutral, according to
the amended convention of 1907. Thus one is assured of an impartial, non
political settlement of the matter. This is what one cannot get before the
World Court, where the judges are not selected by the parties to the
dispute. The Hague Court of Arbitration has functioned well and is still
functioning. There is, then, no need for any World Court.
It is true that a world court to settle all disputes is theoretically de
sirable. That is a worthy ideal, but the millenium has not yet come. The
United States has long advocated such a court, truly judicial in character,
but the World Court is certainly not such a court.
It is said that American adherence to the World Court will be a
great aid to world peace. How that can be is a mystery to me. The
present World Court is not a tribunal organized for the prevention of
hostilities, for it is not permitted to solve war-breeding problems.
This so-called World Court is not a court at all, but merely "a limited
panel of supplemental diplomacy" (see "The, World Court Myth" by
Giblin and Brown, page 381). It is not an independent judicial body at
all. The American ideal of a real World Court which the American dele
gates to the second Hague Conference in 1907 advocated, has not been
followed at all. The United States has advocated a court to which the
parties should have direct access. But the League struck out a provision
to that effect in the Court's Statutes in order to give the League first
consideration of all important matters. The present Court is a body entirely
dominated by the League. The founders of the Court expressly stated that
this was a League Court.
The first article of the Court's Statutes states that it was set up in
accordance with Article 14 of the Covenant of the League of Nations. The
fifteen judges are elected by the League and paid by it. Moreover, by
eliminating an original provision for compulsory jurisdiction, the Council
of the League can dictate what cases are to go before it.
The history of what the Court has done so far shows that it has
been a complete failure. Many of the cases before it have been trivial.
In other cases, its rulings have been disobeyed or made impossible of
fulfillment.
In most of the cases the red issue in dispute were settled by the
Council of the League. This shows clearly that the Court is merely
supplemental to the Council. The control of the Council over the Court
was evidenced by the refusal of the Council to let Greece submit the
Corfu question to the Court; that is iust one example out of many.
The present World Court is not a judicial body but a political body.
Even Professor Manley O. Hudson, the foremost advocate of the Court,
admitted this after the opinion rendered in the Austro-German Customs
Union case on September 5, 1931. (See what he says in the American Bar
Association Journal, Vol. 17, p. 193). It is inconceivable that the United
States will join a Court which its foremost apologist admits is ruled by
political—not judicial—reasons.
Joining the Court will not aid world peace. It would merely give
prestige to a body that is fundamentally wrong. By staying out of the
League Court and encouraging international arbitration, the United States
will help itself and the world.
