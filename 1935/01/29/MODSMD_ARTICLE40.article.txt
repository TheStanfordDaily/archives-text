a position to cast one calm vote for
the World Court. If this were writ
ten with that estimable paper before
me, there would be a great tempta
tion to stuff the ballot box —in the
Court's favor: for over a period of
years of anti-World Court propa
ganda, that sheet has never risen
above the level of patriotic poppy- j
cock in its condemnation of things j
international.
In fact, the most overwhelming I
evidence of the Court's worth is the
nature of the opposition it has
bicught forth. Any sane argument
that there might be against entrance
into the World Court has been ef
fectively drowned out by the bleating
of the fife and drum brigade of 1776.
Instead of attacking the Court in the
light of world affairs of the present
era, its opponents have mustered out j
the ghosts of George Washington,
and of a United States still in the
romper stage. Yes, George Wash
ington warned against "entangling
alliances." But to suggest that the
"Father of His Country" would pre
scribe to his 20th century children (
the identical remedies that suited his
18th century brood is to cast some
doubt on the "Father's" mental acu
men. That, indeed, is unpatriotic.
The plain facts of the case are
simply these:
Whether it likes it or not, the l
United States is inextricably bound
up with every other nation on the*
face of the earth. With fast transport

WORLD COURT: YES

and communication, this nation has
stuck its beagle into the private
boudoirs of every people on earth.
Commercially, economically — we
have passed beyond the stage of iso
lation. Unless we are prepared to go
back to the pastoral peace of the 18th 1
century, we must adjust ourselves to j
an expanded theatre of operations.
Past events have shown that when i
a Serb and an Austrian quarrel in the ,
stieets of a European hamlet, the ;
United States is affected. Unless the l
United States chooses to settle the
next world squabble by force of
arms, it had better decide to help an
organization that has a chance of set- !
tling such squabbles peaceably.
The United States has participated j
in the work of the Hague tribunal, ,
and yet there are still 48 states. Nei- j
ther our honor nor our territory have j
been compromised. The World Court |
(to which we submit cases at our i
volition) attempts to supplement the ;
work of the Hague tribunal. It is
building up a body of international j
law which will serve as precedents I
for the peaceable settlement of future j
disputes. In this respect, it is supe- |
rior to the Hague Tribunal.
In recent years there has been ,
much vague talk of a desire for
world peace. Now, when there comes j
a chance to do something practical j
for world peace, is no time to shy
away from the little white dove and
her olive branch.
