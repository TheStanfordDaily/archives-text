STANFORD'S UP AND DOWN
BASKETBALL TEAM

Once more students on the Farm
may point to the standings of the
Pacific Coast Conference basketball
teams and say "as usual.' Meaning
that "as usual" the Indian hoop team
ij at the bottom of the list.
Two victories for the Little Bears
of the South put Stanford down in
that position which it has been her
ill-luck to occupy for quite a few
years. It has become an accepted
fact—almost a tradition—that Stan
ford basketball teams should hold
down the last rung on the conference
ladder.
It has become an accepted certain
ty that Stanford basketball teams
should annually lose at least two out
of three games to California, and
sometimes all three or four. In other
words the Cardinal hoopsters are not
supposed to win. No one expects
them to win, and consequently the
quintets that wear the cardinal and
white go on the lloor with somewhat
of a futile feeling.

BUNN'S RECORD ONE OF
CONSTANT BUILDING

This applies only to the varsity
teams, for the frosh entering upon a
new life have not the time to become
saturated with the pessimistic line
of gush that is handed out (in all
sides. When they become sopho
mores it begins to sink in and then
the trouble starts.
Such was the situation some five
years ago when John Bun came to
Stanford. He was faced with the
overwhelming problem of building
up a basketball team that had drifted
into chaos, of breaking tradition by
crashing down the walls of pessi
mism that surrounded Stanford bas
ketball.
Bunn realized that the way to
overcome this feeling of inferiority
was to produce a team that would
have the students behind it. During
the five years he has built and plan
ned and worried, always seemingly
hampered by the lack of a good cen
ter, around whom Bunn's system
concentrates.
Last year he had a tall, rugged
center in Hal Edelem who was afraid
to shoot when he could. The 1934
team had the height and lacked the
ability. The present varsity has the
ability and lacks the height. Faced
with these problems Bunn also had
to fight destructive criticism. He has
done his part and the fault can only
be traced back to the students and
players themselves.

FARM SHOULD SUPPORT
PRESENT TEAM

The campus has become so imbued
with the idea that an Indian basket
ball team can't win that it has af
fected the players themselves. Be
fore a football game it is almost a
unanimous conception that the team
will win—and the gridiron team has
done quite well. Before a hoop game
the reverse is true—everyone expects
them to lose. And the players know
it and go on the floor with that
feeling.
Everyone knows what sort of a
feeling it is to set out to do some
thing, while everyone is telling you
it can't be done. Under such handi
caps one cannot possibly be at his
best. And this true of the Cardinal
hoopsters. They are under the handi
cap of public opinion, and the games
lost to conference opponents have
not been lost due to the system or the
coach, but to the "butches" of the
players themselves.
Friday night Stanford again faces
the so-called invincible teams from
the University of California. Every
one expects the frosh to win. Every
one expects the varsity to lose. Why?
Because the frosh are not hampered
by idiotic ideas and play their own
game, while the varsity labors under
the impending spectre of disaster that
is dangled before their eyes by their
own classmates.
We can win, and we will win! It is
just a question of whether the stu
dents want to win. The varsity needs
your co-operation, Coach Bunn needs
your help, Stanford needs your spirit.
See you in the Pavilion Friday night!
