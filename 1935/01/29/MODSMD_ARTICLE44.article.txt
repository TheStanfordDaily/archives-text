# VARSITY'S LINEUP ALTERED BY BUNN TO SHAKE SLUMP
## Lindsey Becomes Regular Guard; Turner Shifted To Center Post 
### Mort D'Evelyn 
Coach John Bunn's varsity hoop
sters opened their fourth week of
conference basketball yesterday af
ternoon and practice for Friday's
Cal game with a revised line-up and
a renewed spirit in a determined at
tempt to break out of the slump of
the past two weeks that has seen
them slip from a first-place tie to
the bottom rung of the league ladder.
The revised line-up consists in the
replacing of A1 Page by Robin Lind
sey at one guard post and the shift
ing of Howell Turner from forward
to center, with Bill Quade taking
over Turner's old positions.
Page Out for 10 Days
Page, who captained the varsity
during most of the games in the
Midwest trip and who has been play
ing varsity basketball during the past
three seasons, dislocated his shoulder
in the first few minutes of the
U.C.L.A. game Saturday night and
v/ill consequently be lost for at least
ten days. Proving especially valuable
with his consistent scoring from the
floor, Lindsey has played consider
ably in all the league games to date,
and fitted smoothly into the first
string last night.
The shifting of Turner is an at
tempt to strengthen the center posi
tion which has proved weak all sea
son and which was the vulnerable
spot in the Indian defense during the
U.C.L.A. series. Keith Topping, who
was expected to take over the job
following the close of football, will
not be able to scrimmage for three
or four days more because of the
infected hand which kept him from
making the Los Angeles trip at the
last minute.
Higher Scoring Hope
Though heighth will be lacking at
the center post, the shifting of Turner
enables Bunn to put a potential high
scorer on the floor in Quade, who
takes over the vacated forward post.
Quade will be a distinct help to the
floor game, and though he has not
played much in games this season,
his shooting is much improved over
last year, when he was second high
scorer for the frosh.
Quade means another sophomore
on the floor, and it was the daring,
fast-breaking, let-'er-fly sophomore
spirit that gave Stanford its win over
the Trojans three weeks ago. Turner,
squad leading scorer, and Moore are
the other two sophs playing first
string, with Dinty chosen to captain
the team in its retyrn game with
California this Friday night in the
Pavilion.

Page Out for 10 Days
Page, who captained the varsity
during most of the games in the
Midwest trip and who has been play
ing varsity basketball during the past
three seasons, dislocated his shoulder
in the first few minutes of the
U.C.L.A. game Saturday night and
v/ill consequently be lost for at least
ten days. Proving especially valuable
with his consistent scoring from the
floor, Lindsey has played consider
ably in all the league games to date,
and fitted smoothly into the first
string last night.
The shifting of Turner is an at
tempt to strengthen the center posi
tion which has proved weak all sea
son and which was the vulnerable
spot in the Indian defense during the
U.C.L.A. series. Keith Topping, who
was expected to take over the job
following the close of football, will
not be able to scrimmage for three
or four days more because of the
infected hand which kept him from
making the Los Angeles trip at the
last minute.
Higher Scoring Hope
Though heighth will be lacking at
the center post, the shifting of Turner
enables Bunn to put a potential high
scorer on the floor in Quade, who
takes over the vacated forward post.
Quade will be a distinct help to the
floor game, and though he has not
played much in games this season,
his shooting is much improved over
last year, when he was second high
scorer for the frosh.
Quade means another sophomore
on the floor, and it was the daring,
fast-breaking, let-'er-fly sophomore
spirit that gave Stanford its win over
the Trojans three weeks ago. Turner,
squad leading scorer, and Moore are
the other two sophs playing first
string, with Dinty chosen to captain
the team in its retyrn game with
California this Friday night in the
Pavilion.
Coach John Bunn's varsity hoop
sters opened their fourth week of
conference basketball yesterday af
ternoon and practice for Friday's
Cal game with a revised line-up and
a renewed spirit in a determined at
tempt to break out of the slump of
the past two weeks that has seen
them slip from a first-place tie to
the bottom rung of the league ladder.
The revised line-up consists in the
replacing of A1 Page by Robin Lind
sey at one guard post and the shift
ing of Howell Turner from forward
to center, with Bill Quade taking
over Turner's old positions.
