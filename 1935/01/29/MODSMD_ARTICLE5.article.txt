# MINORITY RULES AUSTRIA TODAY
## Seeks Anschluss Union For Economic Reasons 
### 
Frank H. Simonds in a syndicated
article Sunday stated of the crucial
Austrian situation: "Today Austria is
governed by a minority which de
rives its real support not from the
Austrian people but from Italian
bayonets."
"The Treaty of St. Germain," the
new Hoover War Library volume by
Nina Almond, librarian, and Dr.
Ralph Haswell Lutz, executive head
of the Hoover War Library, discloses
the futile Austrian plea to the allied
peace conference in the late summer
of 1919, asking for Anschluss with
Germany:
"The (Austrian) National As
sembly solemnly protests before
the entire world against the provi
sions of the Peace Treaty which, â€”
under the pretext of protecting the
independence of German Austria
deprives the German Austrian na
tion of its right of self-determina
tion, and refuses it the right to
realize its ardent desire for union
with the mother-country Ger
many, a desire constituting a vital,
economic, intellectual and political
necessity.
"The National Assembly ex
presses the hope that, as soon as
peace shall have dissipated the
spirit, of animosity and national
rancor provoked by the war, the
Powers will not continue, thanks
to the intervention of the League
of N-vtions. to refuse to the German
people its right to unity and its na
tional liberty, a right accorded to
all other nations."
"I believe the National Assembly
of Austria reflected the true desire
of the 0,000,000 people constituting
the Republic of Austria at the close
of the war as expressed in this docu
ment," states Dr. Lutz.
"Austrian opinion has of course
changed since then," adds the Stan
ford professor, "particularly since the
advent of Hitler in Germany. Since
there has been no election in Austria
since 1930, it is impossible to know
the degree of sentiment in that
country for Anschluss today. It is
probably safe to say, however, that
the great mass of Austrians have not
changed their views radically since
1919 on this question."
