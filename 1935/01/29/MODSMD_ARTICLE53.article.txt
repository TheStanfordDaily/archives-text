# RUGBY SEASON TO START WITH TWO GAMES SATURDAY
## Stanford To Meet U.S.F.; U.C. Engages U.C.L.A. 
### 
The Intercollegiate Rugby League
gets into full swing with no more ado j
next Saturday, with two games
scheduled.
Stanford will have its hands full,
meeting the U.S.F. Dons, another
team with several of the American
football stars. The Hilltop 15 has
beaten the other San Francisco Club
teams, last Saturday trimming the
Blues, 15-3, with no great trouble.
The University of California will
send its team down into the sunny
South, there to engage the U.C.L.A.
fca'ces. The Bears are good this year,
but little is known about Bruin rug
ger play.
Starring for the Bears in their sur
prising defeat of the Olympic Club
Saturday were Captain Miles Hud
son, a dental student from New Zea
land, Bill Sehwabel, My Beeler, Bill
Herbert, Red Bennett, and Louie
Drnovich. the first-string guard.
Coach Harry Maloney had reason
to be pleased with the showing of his
boys Saturday against the Clare
monts, who were no set-up. His for
ward wall still has to scrum a little
better, and Saturday will be the time
to show its improvement, for the
LT.S.F. forwards are mostly football
fellows with plenty of beef and push.
Frank Alustiza will probably get
into his first game Saturday. He was
tied up at his Encina store all day,
and couldn't get out to play against
Claremont. His presence and long
kicking will be mighty helpful Sat
urday.
U.S.C. recently held a consulta
tion and advisement day for visiting
high school and junior college stu
dents.
