i graduate, asked County Clerk Roy
! Field Saturday in San Jose, when
applying for a marriage license.
Standing beside him, his fiancee;
Miss Helen Teskey of San Francisco,
smiled her encouragement.
"We want to be married twice in
I this county," Handler went on. "In
j fact, we may be married five or six
! times, all told. We got a license in
J San Mateo County on our way down
I here."
