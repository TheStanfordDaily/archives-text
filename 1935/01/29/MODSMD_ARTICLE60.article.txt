# Mexican Travel Distances Cut by Airplane Service
## 
### Hester McMasters 
Mexico, primitive lund of the |
peons, over which tourists once j
traveled by slow trains or in rat- j
tling cars over rough roads, has, by
the adoption of the airplane, mod- \
ernized its communication system as I
thoroughly as has the United States.
Distances, once seven hours jour- J
ney from Mexico City, may now be i
flown in two hours, says Dr. Alfred j
Coester, professor of Spanish-Amer
ican literature, in telling about his
recent airplane trip to Mexico. Dr.
Coester flew to Mexico City in four |
hours from Brownsville, Texas. "The
trip was very smooth and enjoyable," j
he said, "the coast on one side and
the mountains on the other."
Another evidence of the adoption ,
ox American methods is the new
theatre of Mexico City, called the |
Palace of Fine Arts, which embodies
the civic center idea, said Dr. Coes
ter. "It is not only a theatre but cor
responds to the exhibit rooms of oui
libraries, a collection of Mexican art
being on permanent display."
In describing the theatre, Dr. Coes
ter said, "It is of all kinds of Mex-- !
ican marble within—a seven million
dollar structure—perhaps rather ex
travagant—but—that's the way they j
do things.",
