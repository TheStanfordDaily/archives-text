# EX COMMITTEE WILL CONSIDER THEATRE PLANS
## Daily 15 Cents and Salary For Managing Editor To Be Debated 
### 
The New Theatre, which A.S.S.U.
President Marvie Kahn and Ex
Committee are trying to change from
a Stanford tradition into an act uality,
will probably be the main considera
tion of Ex Committee in its meeting
tonight.
Though plans are still incomplete,
and the problem of finances is far
from solved, the New Theatre Com
mittee, of which Kahn is head, is
working with the goal (?f starting
construction by this summer. Prog
ress of the Theatre plans to date will
be told by Kahn tonight.
15 Cents Still Doubtful
Daily business, the watchword of
many a heated imbroglio, may be off
the collective chest for the first time
this year, if two Daily matters are
decided tonight: the disputed 15
cents, and the proposal affecting the
managing editor's salary.
Agreed to last meeting was a $20
monthly salary for the managing
editor, beginning next volume of The
Daily. Left undecided was the ques
tion of the managing editor's right to
b'j nominated for editor and his share
of the profits.
Publications Council yesterday
afternoon voted to change two of
their by-laws. One by-law would
provide that the managing editor
get 5 per cent of the profits instead
of 7M> per cent, while the women's
editor receives 2Vz per cent.
Building Fund Planned
The other by-law effects the pro
posed publications building. It pro
poses $2,000 be set aside from Daily
profits for financial emergencies, the
rest to go into a building fund ad
ministered by the Board of Trustees.
These two by-laws of the Publica
tions Council Charter will go into
effect, unless a majority of the voting
members of Ex Committee rules oth
erwise tonight.
The 15 cents, which was amputated
from The Daily 75-cent subscription
fee by a 5-4 vote of Ex Committee
last week, and grafted back on by a
decision of Dean Marion Kirkwood
of the law school that a three-fourths
vote of the voting members was re
quired to perform the operation, will
be brought up tonight as a matter of
form, according to Kahn.
