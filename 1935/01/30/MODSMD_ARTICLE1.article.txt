# EX COMMITTEE SETTLES DAILY FEE DISCUSSION
## Three University of Mexico Students of Good Will Attend Meeting DISCUSS NEW THEATRE 2 Yell Nominees Ineligible; Alternates Chosen 
### Irvin Jorgensen 
Put on their best behavior last
night by a visiting delegation of
three good-will tourists from the
University of Mexico, Ex Commit
tee indulged in a few heated bursts
of oratory, and A.S.S.U. President
Marvie Kahn exhibited some ele
mentary Spanish as a welcome to the
visitors.
Standing up as if faced with a
firing squad while they received
Kahn's greetings, Senors Nunez, De
La Torre, and Asencio subsided into
a bewildered silence as Ex Commit
tee continued its complicated busi
ness fn English, which the visitors
fortunately could not understand.
Kahn Reports on Theatre
A report from Kahn on the New
Theatre revealed that blue-prints for
the structure are as indefinite at
present as the funds which are to
finance. University architects are
now working on two different plans,
which will try to combine the ad
vantages of an assembly hall and a
Little Theatre in the same structure.
One proposal would the the
atre with one auditorium, which
could be decreased in size to 900
seats to give it thp advantage of a
Little Theatre in acoustics. The other
suggestion is to have the building in
two auditoriums, using a double
faced stage and having 900 seats on
one side and 1500 on the other.
Daily Again
'"Daily business as usual," could
have been the sign hung out by
Stanford's legislature last night. The
75-cent subscription fee will remain
with The Daily, the managing editor
will get a $20 monthly salary and 5
per cent of the profits, beginning with
next volume, and The Daily building
fund was approved. The fund will be
kept in the Students' Organization
Fund, instead, of in a trustees' fund
recommended by Publications Coun
cil.
The share of the profits of which
Daily executives receive a percent
age was changed from a maximum of
$1200 to $1000.
Yell Leader Alternates
Because the Rally Committee
chose for their six assistant yell
leader nominees two who were not
as good at hitting the books as the
yells, Election Chairman John Brock
referred to Ex Committee the selec
tion of two alternates. The six nomi
nees now are Dick Bibbero, Bill
Molineux, Web Jones, Bob Ran
zoni, Talbot Shelton, and Howard
Carr, one of whom must make up
incompletes before the ballots for the
February student elections.
Cross-country awards were given
to Dave Devlin, Robert Alexander,
Marion Marsh, and Chuck Nimmo.
Polo awards were granted to two
men who graduated last quarter:
Luppe Luppen (who gets a Block,
because it is his third award), and
Cal Emeis.
Bill Rogers' suggestion that a shod
to house homeless Toyon automo
biles be at least referred to commit
tee died in a nameless grave, as Ex
Committee members turned a deaf
ear and a cold heart to the idea.
