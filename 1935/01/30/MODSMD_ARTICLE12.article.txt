sued the following statement:
"It seems incredible to us that the
State Board of Equalization is high
er than the Supreme Court.
"We have protested and will con
tinue to protest as long as* the laws
of the State are violated.
"If this is becoming a rule of men
rather than of laws it is time for
all of us to jump in and get busy."
