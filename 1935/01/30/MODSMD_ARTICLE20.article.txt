Expressing the opinion that the
J economic" advances made in Russia
' under the Soviet regime have not
j compensated for the suffering neces
| sary to effect them, William H.
j Chamberlin, foreign correspondent
' for the Christian Science Monitor,
j last night described concisely his
j "Ten Years in Soviet Russia" before
i a capacity Assembly Hall audience.
Chamberlin stated that the re
! cently completed Five-Year Plan,
! driven forward ruthlessly by the
Communist government, had for its
main goals industrialization and ag
; ricultural collectivization. It desired
j industrialization in order to make'
i the country economically self-suffi
j cient and to build up a strong mili
| tary machine as' protection against
I Japan and Germany.
One of the less desirable results of
j the industrialization program was a
sever decline in the standard of liv
ing of the Russian people between
I 1929 and 1933. In order to obtain
foreign currency with which to pay
! for the necessary capital equipment,
i the Soviet was forced to export a
j large amount of the agricultural
â– products of the nation, leaving the
i people with an insufficient food
| supply.
The result was a widespread fam
ine in 1933 which caused untold suf
! fering and brought about the death
jby starvation of some 4 million
Russians.
