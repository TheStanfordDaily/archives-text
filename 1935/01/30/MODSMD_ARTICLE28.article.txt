# WORLD COURT'S OPPONENTS WIN SENATE BALLOT
## Affirmative Vote of 52 Falls Short of Necessary Two-Thirds Quota ISSUE IS NOW DEAD Many Influenced by Norris; Desert Administration 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 29 (/P).—
American membership in the World
Court was injected today by the
Senate.
The vote was 52 for adherence to
36- against, falling far short of the
required two-thirds.
A burst of applause from the gal
leries greeted announcement of the
vote by Vice-President Garner.
Last Minute Concession
The vote following a 12-year dis
pute between some members of the
Senate and four presidents, wfis pre
ceded by a last-minute* concession
by the administration to the opposi
tion.
A reservation was adopted without
a record vote to prevent the United
States from taking a question to the
coui't without first negotiating a
general or special treaty with the
nation in which it was a dispute.
That was not sufficient, however,
and the court opponents triumphed.
Issue Now Dead
The reservation had been ap
proved by President Roosevelt, and
administration supporters had
claimed enough votes for ratification.
The action means the court issue,
as far as this country is concerned,
is dead for some time to come—if not
permanently.
Optimism had prevailed among
the pro-court forces after Sepator
Robinson, the Democratic leader
and spearhead of the ratification
drive, had announced acceptance,
with Fresident Roosevelt's consent,
of a binding reservation. Introduced
by Senator Thomas (D., Utah), it
would have required negotiation of
"general or special treaties" before
the United States could submit a
question to the court.
Norris Swings Votes
But Senator Norris (R., Neb.),
author of a more stringent reserva
tion that lost last week — which
would have given the Senate control
over all questions to be submitted
by the United States—took the floor
late in the day, and said he was
still dissa'tisfied. Observers felt that
he undoubtedly carried many votes
I which previously had lined up with
' the administration.
With 88 Senators voting, the ad
j herence advocates could only mar
shal 43 Democrats and nine Repub
licans on the final roll call. Oppo
nents gathered in 20 Democrats, 14
Republicans and LaFollette, Wis
consin Progressive, and Shipstead,
Minnesota Farmer-Laborite.

A reservation was adopted without
a record vote to prevent the United
States from taking a question to the
coui't without first negotiating a
general or special treaty with the
nation in which it was a dispute.
That was not sufficient, however,
and the court opponents triumphed.
Issue Now Dead
The reservation had been ap
proved by President Roosevelt, and
administration supporters had
claimed enough votes for ratification.
The action means the court issue,
as far as this country is concerned,
is dead for some time to come—if not
permanently.
Optimism had prevailed among
the pro-court forces after Sepator
Robinson, the Democratic leader
and spearhead of the ratification
drive, had announced acceptance,
with Fresident Roosevelt's consent,
of a binding reservation. Introduced
by Senator Thomas (D., Utah), it
would have required negotiation of
"general or special treaties" before
the United States could submit a
question to the court.
Norris Swings Votes
But Senator Norris (R., Neb.),
author of a more stringent reserva
tion that lost last week — which
would have given the Senate control
over all questions to be submitted
by the United States—took the floor
late in the day, and said he was
still dissa'tisfied. Observers felt that
he undoubtedly carried many votes
I which previously had lined up with
' the administration.
With 88 Senators voting, the ad
j herence advocates could only mar
shal 43 Democrats and nine Repub
licans on the final roll call. Oppo
nents gathered in 20 Democrats, 14
Republicans and LaFollette, Wis
consin Progressive, and Shipstead,
Minnesota Farmer-Laborite.
