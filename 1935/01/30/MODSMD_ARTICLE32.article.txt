# League of Nations, japan to the Contrary
## 
### 
In I lie face of League of Nations condem
nation und general world disapproval, Japan
goes serenely ahead with her efforts to achieve
additional territory and control in China.
Whether disguised as a boundary dispute,
retaliation against Chinese aggression or what
not, .Japan's ultimate policy seems quite clear.
Her announcement at (ieneva of a possible
Sino-.lapanese agreement over the economic
and financial development of China is evi
dance enough of Japan's purpose. The first
objective of the agreement would be co-opera
lion in a drive against communism in China.
Second would come the economic develop
ment of China with a consequent enlarged
market for .Japanese goods and investments.
What China thinks of the idea is probably an
other story.
And, despite the sanctimonious protests of
the Western»powers, the whole thing would
probably be a very good idea, provided China
were willing. Disunited, backward, and wal
lowing in a state ot economic chaos, China
would probably benefit tremendously by Jap
anese co-operation even though it would, in
cidentally, line the pockets of Japanese in
dustrialists. Independence .and liberty are
stronger forces than economic progress and
it is doubtful if China would willingly sur
render the former.
The amusing feature of the whole situation
is the moral approach that Western nations
take to the problem. There are doubtless good
and sufiicient political and economic reasons
for European and American opposition to
Japan's policy.
But the hands-uplifled-in-horror altitude of
these nations smacks of flagrant hypocrisy
when we consider the comparatively recent
partitions of Africa and the spheres of inllu
ence policy adopted in China not so many
years ago. And even America was not too
squeamish about enlarging her own territory
when the expansion of population and indus
try demanded it.
It looks very much like a case of the pot
calling the' kettle black.
