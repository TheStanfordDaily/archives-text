# Swastika Over Germany

purge" with the "liquidation" of Capt. Roehm and
minor leaders. The plot to kill Hitler. The Nazi
credo applied to executions . . .)
Hitler's "blood purge" of last June 30 aroused
much speculation as to the real reasons for such
"wholesale assassinations" and caused a buzz of com
ment in Germany as to the motive which impelled Dei-
Fuehrer to have put to death his friend and adviser,
Captain Roehm, and others.
For quite a number of years every informed person
in Germany had been aware of Captain Roehm's homo
sexual character, and if this is given as the reason for
his liquidation, that is wrong. It is the "I told you, so"
reason.
When it becomes known that there really was a
plot to overthrow Hitler, and that the man was
already hired and instructed whose duty it was to
kill the leader, then the picture changes. This is no
canard invented by the ministry of propaganda to
use «js an excuse; it is fact. (Needless to say, the
would-be assassin was also quietly liquidated.)
Of the real plans which were designed to change the
whole scheme of things, only a few leaders in Munich
had any idea. But the conspirators had been under
observation for a long time, and this surveillance was
kept very quiet.
The real credit for discovering the plans goes not to
the intelligence officers, but to some of the secret police
of the Schutz StafTel, Hitler's own gigantic body
guard. They are disinterested in politics but fanatically
devoted to their leader. •
On the day before the "blood purge," all the
lesser leaders of the Bavarian SA (storm troops)
gathered at the country home of Stabschef Roehm
for a little party after having met at Munich.
They were sleeping in Roehm's house when they
were surprised by their commander-in-chief.
Hitler. They were then taken to. Munich, asked to
shoot themselves or be shot, and thus done away
with.
In Prussia. Minister-President Goering took care of
the lesser details of the "cleansing."
Cock-and-bull stories about mass executions are
true only insofar as the "mass" executed amounted io
never more than four or five at a time. Some would
have been later shot, or "framed" as we do it at
home, anyway.
The Nazis believe, perhaps very logically, that their
method of doing away with wrongdoers, where they
get perhaps 90 per cent accuracy, is much better than
the American haphazard system, with better than a
fifty-fifty chance for the real criminals to escape.
In a country where even an engaged couple will
greet each other on meeting with "Heil Hitler," politics
are a bit of something else again, not as in the United
States.

(June :iO, HKI4. The beginning of the Nazi "blood
purge" with the "liquidation" of Capt. Roehm and
minor leaders. The plot to kill Hitler. The Nazi
credo applied to executions . . .)
Hitler's "blood purge" of last June 30 aroused
much speculation as to the real reasons for such
"wholesale assassinations" and caused a buzz of com
ment in Germany as to the motive which impelled Dei-
Fuehrer to have put to death his friend and adviser,
Captain Roehm, and others.
For quite a number of years every informed person
in Germany had been aware of Captain Roehm's homo
sexual character, and if this is given as the reason for
his liquidation, that is wrong. It is the "I told you, so"
reason.
When it becomes known that there really was a
plot to overthrow Hitler, and that the man was
already hired and instructed whose duty it was to
kill the leader, then the picture changes. This is no
canard invented by the ministry of propaganda to
use «js an excuse; it is fact. (Needless to say, the
would-be assassin was also quietly liquidated.)
Of the real plans which were designed to change the
whole scheme of things, only a few leaders in Munich
had any idea. But the conspirators had been under
observation for a long time, and this surveillance was
kept very quiet.
The real credit for discovering the plans goes not to
the intelligence officers, but to some of the secret police
of the Schutz StafTel, Hitler's own gigantic body
guard. They are disinterested in politics but fanatically
devoted to their leader. •
On the day before the "blood purge," all the
