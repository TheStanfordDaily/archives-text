I We naturally inquire, "Is this tendency to glorify
j the chief executive not a new trait of American democ
racy? Has the New Deal not brought with it changing
| concepts of democracy?"
Professor Edgar E. Robinson, executive head of the
j history department and author of "American Democ
| racy in Time of Crisis," when asked these questions,
j answered:
"From the founding of our country, there has
always existed to a marked degree among the
American people the tendency to apotheosize the
chief executive. It was true in the case of Wash
ington; it was true of Jefferson: it was true of
Jackson; it was not true of Lincoln until after his
death; it is strange to think so but it was true of
IWcKinley. This tendency w.s accentuated in the
case of Theodore Roosevelt and our war president,
Woodrow Wilson, and during the first six months
of Herbert Hoover's administration.
"It is true today in the case of Franklin D. Roose
j velt. The holiday spirit pervading American life on
the President's birthday indicates how personal his
! appeal has become to the country, by means of the
j radio, motion picture, Roosevelt's books, and a friendly
press.
"As for the New Deal bringing with it changing con
j cepts of American democracy, I believe Roosevelt made
, his position on democracy unequivocal in his presi
| dential campaign speech in San Francisco, September
I 23, 1932, in which he said:
" 'As long as we had free land, as long as the popu
i lation was growing by leaps and bounds, as long as
> our industrial plants were insufficient to supply our
I own needs, society chose to give the ambitious man
I free play and unlimited reward, provided only that he
! produced the economic plant so much desired.
" 'In retrospect we can now see that the turn of the
tide came with the turn of the century. We were reach
l ing our last frontier; there was no more free land and
j our industrial combinations had become great uncon
j trollable and irresponsible units of power within the
state.
'"The day of the great promoter or the financial
Titan, to whom we granted everything if only he
would huild or develop, is over. Our task now is
not discovery, exploitation of natural resources,
or necessarily producing more goods. It is the
soberer, less dramatic business of administering
resources and phnts already in hand, of seeking to
re-establish foreign markets for our surplus pro
duction, of meeting the problem of underconsump
tion, of adjusting production to consumption, of
distributing wealth and products more equitably, of
iidapting existing economic organizations to the
service of the people. The day of enlightened ad
ministration has come.' "
Professor Robinson concludes: "Roosevelt today ap
j pears to have the overwhelming endorsement of Amer
( icans, but currents of public opinion are unpredictable.
! I need hardly say that popularity of a
| man or an ideal gives no certainty a.s to value or wisdom
j or place in history. Moreover, our greatest men have
I been most severely condemned. I do not believe funda
mentals of American democracy have changed, but only
shifted their emphasis in certain aspects as brought out
by Roosevelt."
