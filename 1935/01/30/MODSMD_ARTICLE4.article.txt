# RUSSIAN DRAMA READ TOMORROW
## Sword and Sandals To Give Red Problem Play 
### 
"Fear," the highly successful Sov- j
ic-t drama by Alexander Afinogenyev, ;
will be read tomorrow evening by ,
Sword and Sandals at 7:30 o'clock in 1
the Little Theatre.
"Fear" is vastly different from
most Soviet propaganda plays. It is
a well-constructed, moving drama
of the problems facing the intellec
tual class in Russia.
Science, according to Afinogenyev,
and Communists generally, cannot ;
remain politically apathetic. It is an
instrument of the class struggle, of
the Revolution, and must be ap
proached in that spirit. The process 1
whereby an honest, but old-fash- |
ioned and individualistic scientist.
Piofessor Borodin (played by Paul j
Clary), learns this Communist les
sen makes the subject-matter of the
play- |
Desiring to establish eternal, class- ,
less, apolitical laws of science, the
professor finds himself a tool in the j
hands of anti-Soviet elements; only
after he is convinced of his error by
his own suffering is he reconciled to :
the new conditions.
The theme is one which has stimu
lated a great many Soviet novelists j
and playwrights, if only because
many of them, being intellectuals j
themselves, must solve the problem J
in their own lives. Afinogenyev has ;
Handled the touchy subject with â– 
more daring than most, exposing not ;
only the mistakes but the genuine
grievances of the old educated i
classes called on to serve new
masters.
Besides Paul Crary, who starred
in "One Sunday Afternoon" and,
"Arms and the Man," the cast in- i
eludes Sidney Head, Robert Moore, J
and Drayton Bryant, who appeared
in the recent reading of "Twelfth
Night"; James Benet and Jean Al- '
bertson, long prominent in campus !
dramatics; and several newcomers, j
including Curtis Barnes, Virginia
Swafford, and Marian Wetmore.
Robert Dwati is directing the pro- j
duction, for which an admission fee |
of ten cents will be charged.
