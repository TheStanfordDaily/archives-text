# BULL SESSION
## LIQUOR: LICENSED OR UNLICENSED? 
### 
Menlo Park—enshrined in Stan-i
ford song and tradition—is once more
selling legal liquor. The liquor is no ;
novelty; the legality is. With re
markable consistency, Menlo sold |
liquor during the Dry Decade, during
the Neo-Repeal era, during the days
when Stanford has vigorously said
"NO." Menlo likes to sell liquor.
And Stanford likes to drink it.
There has been little noticeable
i difference between those periods in
the alcohol cycle dubbed "Dry," and
those called "Wet." Practical observ
ers say the only difference is that in
the legal periods you have some idea
| of what you are getting; and in the
illegal periods a bottle labeled
"Scotch" might be anything from
perfumed fusel oil to the reeking off
' scourings of old bath tubs. In addi
tion, legality assures the state of
some revenue. But whether it's legal
or no, the alcohol continues to flow.
To anyone but the Menlo liquor
dealers and the Stanford administra
tion it is a matter of small moment
whether the charmed circle of legal
ity is drawn at the mile or the mile
and-one-half limit. At a mile or at
] a mile-and-one-half, a bottle of gin
is just as intoxicating. And with the
advent of the newer inventions —the
automobile, for instance—it is quite
difficult to tell the difference between
: a mile and a mile-an-one-half.
Stanford students have not been
greatly bothered by liquor regula
tions. With liquor in a scattering of
I miscellaneous Farm domiciles, Stan
; ford men and women are living in a

| pre-Repeal paradise. Repeal -which
robbed millions of American men
; and women of the sly joys of illicit
liquor consumption—has not terror
| ized the Farm. The old order has not
passed.
It is nice sometimes to dream of
light wines and beer in the Cellar.
' Over their cups, generations of Stan
! ford students have dreamed of a day
| when the Farm would recognize a
practical life situation, when the men
and women of the University would
: drink as law-abiding citizens and not
as potential criminals. But all that is
I pure fantasy. For the present —
Menlo suffices.
