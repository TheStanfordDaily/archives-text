# PRACTICE STIFFENS AS BUNN PREPARES FOR FRIDAY GAME
## Gray Quintet Scrimmages Revamped Varsity Aggregation 
### Phil Duffy 
Practice for the forthcoming bas
ketball game with California took
definite shape last night as Coach
John Bunn sent his team through
active defensive and offensive drilLs.
Competition is added to the regu
lar practice sessions by the Gray
basketball team under the supervi
sion of Chuck Glasgow, aide to
Bunn. The Gray team is composed
mostly of ineligibles and those who
failed to make the regular varsity
team, but have possibilities for next
year.
Grays Have Height
Beside the 14 players on the var
sity squad, the Gray team is com
posed of some six or eight men.
Among them are Art Stoefen, How
ard Paine, Ed Proctor, Pete Allen,
Harmon Howard, and Andy Spears.
Each week this quintet assumes the
defensive tactics of the team the
Cardinals are to meet, and scrim
mages with the varsity in regular
drills.
This method proves effective as
the Gray team has an average
height of six feet two inches and
makes the Indian team step fast.
Stoefen and Allen are six feet four
and one-half inches, Paine is six
feet four, Spears six two, and How
ard six one.
New Varsity Lineup
Last night the Gray team played
the Bear style of defense, while the
rejuvenated varsity of Bill Quade
and Rod Bost at forwards, Howell
Turner at center, and Dinty Moore
and Robin Lindsey at guards, en
deavored to penetrate the Gray
defense.
California plays three men back
and two in the front line on defense.
The three back men play a strict
man to man defense while one of
the front men drifts with the offen
sive guard in the event that the
latter breaks for the bucket. The
fifth man of the Berkeley defense
stays way out for a pass. This posi
tion is usually assumed by Dave;
Meek, Bear center.
Team Shows Pep
Pep and fast passwork marked the |
play of the varsity against the Grays j
and time and again the Cal defense ;
was penetrated for a field goal.!
Should the varsity keep up the style !
of play it is demonstrating in prac- j
tice the Golden Bear will have a'
bad evening Friday.
Keith Topping made an appear- j
ance on the court, but confined his j
workout to shooting goals. Top
ping's infected hand is still ban- ■
daged. He will probably be able to I
scrimmage tonight, and in all events i
will be in readiness for the Bear
game.

John Bunn sent his team through
active defensive and offensive drilLs.
Competition is added to the regu
lar practice sessions by the Gray
basketball team under the supervi
sion of Chuck Glasgow, aide to
Bunn. The Gray team is composed
mostly of ineligibles and those who
failed to make the regular varsity
team, but have possibilities for next
year.
Grays Have Height
Beside the 14 players on the var
sity squad, the Gray team is com
posed of some six or eight men.
Among them are Art Stoefen, How
ard Paine, Ed Proctor, Pete Allen,
Harmon Howard, and Andy Spears.
Each week this quintet assumes the
defensive tactics of the team the
Cardinals are to meet, and scrim
mages with the varsity in regular
drills.
This method proves effective as
the Gray team has an average
height of six feet two inches and
makes the Indian team step fast.
Stoefen and Allen are six feet four
and one-half inches, Paine is six
feet four, Spears six two, and How
ard six one.
New Varsity Lineup
Last night the Gray team played
the Bear style of defense, while the
rejuvenated varsity of Bill Quade
and Rod Bost at forwards, Howell
Turner at center, and Dinty Moore
and Robin Lindsey at guards, en
deavored to penetrate the Gray
defense.
California plays three men back
and two in the front line on defense.
The three back men play a strict
man to man defense while one of
the front men drifts with the offen
sive guard in the event that the
latter breaks for the bucket. The
fifth man of the Berkeley defense
stays way out for a pass. This posi
tion is usually assumed by Dave;
Meek, Bear center.
Team Shows Pep
Pep and fast passwork marked the |
play of the varsity against the Grays j
and time and again the Cal defense ;
was penetrated for a field goal.!
Should the varsity keep up the style !
of play it is demonstrating in prac- j
tice the Golden Bear will have a'
bad evening Friday.
Keith Topping made an appear- j
ance on the court, but confined his j
workout to shooting goals. Top
ping's infected hand is still ban- ■
daged. He will probably be able to I
scrimmage tonight, and in all events i
will be in readiness for the Bear
game.
