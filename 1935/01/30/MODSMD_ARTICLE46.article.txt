# Record Shows Bradshaw Men Can Beat Cubs
## Comparative Figures Give Team 43 Point Edge 
### Gordy Frost 
Stanford 73, California 30 is the
way the scoreboard might read when
Bear and Indian freshmen basketball
' teams leave the Pavilion floor Friday
j night, if comparative scores could be
relied upon to predict the "little big
| game" outcome.
"Figures don't lie," and the fig
i ures show that Stanford has a 43
point edge over Cal l'rosh. Xmo
j weeks °go the Boars defeated
Santa Clara J. C. 34-28; last week
end the Stanford freshmen tramp
led upon that same squad 73-24.
i Though appearing weak from the
! comparative score angle the Cal
! yearlings should give a better ac-
I count of themselves than figures
[ grant. Height is no worry for the
I Bears as they range well up into the
; six foot mark with one giant stand
j ing 6 feet 8 inches. Bob Zonne and
Hank Luisetti, Stanford's tallest first
stringers, stand 6 feet 4 inches and G
feet 2Vz inches respectively.
McCorney Is Cal Threat
Bob McCorney, shifty Cal forward,
I holds scoring honors for that squad
and is expected to be the most ser
-1 ious threat to the local team. Two
| other Bear freshmen, Bud Russell,
' center, and Carol Hill, guard, will
probably cause Stanford some worry
Friday. Hill was responsible for
California's 25-23 victory over Poly
technic High School last weekend
when he shot the winning basket in
the final minute of play, the ball sail
ing through the hoop after the gun
had sounded.
j Saturday night in the Pavilion the
; Stanford frosh will play Berkeley
High School, usually the champions
| of Alameda County but this year a
| comparatively weak squad. Berkeley
| boasts two threats in the persons of
! Bill Bigorstaff, rangy center, and
; Bud Roletto, veteran guard.
Stanford's freshmen, with the
exception of Boh Zonne, are in the
best of shape for the weekend's
games. Zonne is still bothered with
] a pulled chest ligament but this
i injury is not expected to keep him
! from the floor.
Hank Luisetti, newly elected frosh
captain, has a striking record for the
season thus far and should be the
center of Stanford's offense. Luisetti
has scored an average of 19 and one
half points per game according to
figures compiled by Don Liebendor
fer, Stanford news director.

half points per game according to
figures compiled by Don Liebendor
fer, Stanford news director.
Stanford 73, California 30 is the
way the scoreboard might read when
Bear and Indian freshmen basketball
' teams leave the Pavilion floor Friday
j night, if comparative scores could be
relied upon to predict the "little big
| game" outcome.
"Figures don't lie," and the fig
i ures show that Stanford has a 43
point edge over Cal l'rosh. Xmo
j weeks °go the Boars defeated
Santa Clara J. C. 34-28; last week
end the Stanford freshmen tramp
led upon that same squad 73-24.
i Though appearing weak from the
! comparative score angle the Cal
! yearlings should give a better ac-
I count of themselves than figures
[ grant. Height is no worry for the
I Bears as they range well up into the
; six foot mark with one giant stand
j ing 6 feet 8 inches. Bob Zonne and
Hank Luisetti, Stanford's tallest first
stringers, stand 6 feet 4 inches and G
feet 2Vz inches respectively.
McCorney Is Cal Threat
Bob McCorney, shifty Cal forward,
I holds scoring honors for that squad
and is expected to be the most ser
-1 ious threat to the local team. Two
| other Bear freshmen, Bud Russell,
' center, and Carol Hill, guard, will
probably cause Stanford some worry
Friday. Hill was responsible for
California's 25-23 victory over Poly
technic High School last weekend
when he shot the winning basket in
the final minute of play, the ball sail
ing through the hoop after the gun
had sounded.
j Saturday night in the Pavilion the
; Stanford frosh will play Berkeley
High School, usually the champions
| of Alameda County but this year a
| comparatively weak squad. Berkeley
| boasts two threats in the persons of
! Bill Bigorstaff, rangy center, and
; Bud Roletto, veteran guard.
Stanford's freshmen, with the
exception of Boh Zonne, are in the
best of shape for the weekend's
games. Zonne is still bothered with
] a pulled chest ligament but this
i injury is not expected to keep him
! from the floor.
Hank Luisetti, newly elected frosh
captain, has a striking record for the
season thus far and should be the
center of Stanford's offense. Luisetti
has scored an average of 19 and one
half points per game according to
figures compiled by Don Liebendor
fer, Stanford news director.
