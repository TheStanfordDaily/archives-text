# Maloney Schedules Two Practices for Ruggers
## 
### 
Card ruggers enjoyed brief respite
yesterday, with no workout sched
uled. Coach Harry Maloney will
hand his men two hard sessions to
day and tomorrow, however, in prep
aration for Saturday's tilt with the
U.S.F. Dons.
The Card and Don fifteens look
fairly evenly matched. Both have
won all of their games, and both have
a set of fast and shifty backs and
big, active forward line men.
Bill Hinch, Ray Petersen, and
Mike Bacciarini are possible stars
for the Dons in the way of scoring
points, to offset the combined threat
of Stanford's Reisner, Vigna, Lewis,
Trompas, and Cockins.
