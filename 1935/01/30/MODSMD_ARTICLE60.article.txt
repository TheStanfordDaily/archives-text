"MR. PIM PASSES BY"
At the Palo Alto Civic Theatre
A. A. Milne's comedy, "Mr. Pirn
Passes By," presented last week with
great success at the Palo Alto Civic
Theatre, was a very difficult vehicle
for an amateur dramatics group to
I undertake.
For a Milne play has very little
j action and relies, for its effect, on
| careful, clear-cut character delin
] eation and gentle, suave rises to gen
tle climaxes. Usually, it is all a
: competent actor can do to discover
I the character he is playing, without
| trying to obtain the apparent lack of
technique and ease ("evidence of his
mastery of acting technique itself")
] for which the play calls.
r yie cast managed to catch most of
j this, and the result was a delightfully
! entertaining production. True, the
| "lightness" at times became forced,
I notably in the kittenish scenes be
' tween the youthful lovers, but in all,
| Milne's mellow humour and whim
sical characterizations were faith
' fully reproduced.
The plot, light as always, is true to
! the playwright's pleasant philosophy,
j for although, in his play, people do
j mean and unkind acts and should
| become very annoying to each other,
jhe always endows one character
with sufficient breadth of under
j standing to overlook these "petty"
faults and interpret to the audience
the other characters at their true
: value.
So, when Mr. Pirn, an aged gen
j tleman with a love of gossip and a
i poor memory for names, visits a
I happy family, his "passing by" nearly
j ruins them all. A Russian would
have evolved a terrific tragic drama,
j showing how an insignificant inci
j dent may launch a fatal, soul-stir
| ling tragedy. But, instead, Milne,
j through the charming character of
| Olivia, allows this tragic theme to
! "pass by" too, so to speak, and em-
I ploys it to iron out the minor prob
lems which have faced the family at
| the opening of the play; such mo
mentous problems as the hanging of
! new curtains in the drawing room
I and the marriage of the attractive
j niece to an equally attractive and
j promising artist.
Dr. Sharp made a complete and
lovable character out of Mr. Pim, the
old gentleman who just "couldn't re-
I member names." Ann Weyland,
former campus star, was a charming
Olivia, displaying all the necessary
poise for which her role called. Waldo
Salt and Harriette Hall Kilby were
the young lovers. Mrs. Kilby was
vivacious and humorous in her part.
A slight criticism might be made in
her too often repeating the same ges
j tures. Salt's characterization, in sin
cerity and variation, is perhaps his
j best to date.
* The productions of the Community
Players have been improving with
each presentation. With "Mr. Pim
I Passes By" Director Ralph Welles
! has achieved a dramatic success
| which completely justifies the Little
Theatre movement.
