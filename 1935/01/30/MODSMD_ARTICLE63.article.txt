# CAMPUS OPINION

The Editor, Sir:
After reading the eminent Mr.
Brill's review in yesterday's Daily of
"Forsaking All Others" we have de
cided that he must be an ardent
reader of the New York Times and
also that he never saw the show.
Insofar as practically the entire cam
pus thinks it was a swell show, we
fail to see Mr. Brill's point of view.
Also, he should by this time know
the difference between a bootblack's
kit and a "monkey and hand organ,"
neither of the latter being in the pic
ture. We might agree that the plot
was a bit feeble but the snappy dia
logue made up for it. Another thing,
Gable was not a play-boy.

The Editor, Sir:
The Reviewer acknowledges the
Misters Freeman, Paris, and Cayton's
criticism on "Forsaking All Others"
as being based in fact. True, there
was no hand-organ and monkey in
the film, but you'll have to admit that
it would have been much improved
if there had been. My mention of it
may slide under the heading of "lit
erary license," even thought it was
not accurate dramatic criticism.
