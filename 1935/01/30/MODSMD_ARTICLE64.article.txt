At the V<vsity
MGM tried to repeat on "The Thin
Man" and didn't quite succeed.
"Evelyn Prentice" has the same two
leads, Bill Powell and Myrna Loy,
plus another of the movies' current
crop of ''awful
brats," Cora Sue
Collins. At least,
we think she's an
awful brat. This
would be a
standard "who
dunit" except for
for the usual
polished MGM production. Dialogue
and direction are always good.
According to Walter Winchell,
Myrna Loy is now the favorite
femme star among the men. 'We
can believe it. She has s.a. plus a
certain air of being a good pal.
Silliest shot: Powell, Loy, and
Collins doing their morning setting
up exercises.
