ALUMNI—
Here It Is—Make It Yours
LAKE LAGUNITA IN SPRING
We of the younger generation realize those days of '00 were the "good old days"—and then
came the long period when "500" meant more than just the number after 499—and now—
but why talk! We'll let this issue of the DAILY speak for the good old days of 1935!
It looks somewhat different than the DAILY (or the "Dippy") you used to know, doesn't it?
.
But it is really the same old sheet at heart—filled with news of interesting happenings of the
Farm ranging from minor sports to major campaigns on the political front—and you'll enjoy it
as much as ever whether you graduated in the gay '00's or the gaudy '34's!
