# MENLO LIQUOR RIGHTS 10 BE DECLARED VOID
## Action Caused by Failure Of Equalization Board To Interpret Ruling LIQUOR DEALERS MOVE New Survey Will Be Made Of Restricted Area 
### 
All liquor licenses that were is
sued for 1935 in the prohibited area
of a mile and a half from the Stan
ford campus will be cancelled, it was
revealed yesterday by Frank Kees
ling, attorney for the State Board of
Equalization.
Keesling said that the hoard ne
glected to check up on the limit as
set by the State Supreme Court,
hut that "a re-investigation of all
places close to the campus" will he
made to determine which fall with
in the restricted area. The ruling
of the court sets the boundary as
the campus limits, and not the
Administration building.
Contrary to Keesling's statement,
Don Marshall, chief enforcement of
ficer for the Board of Equalization
in the San Francisco-San Mateo
county area, said yesterday that he
had received no order from the
board regarding the court ruling, and
no notification that the licenses were
not to be issued in Menlo Park.
With the announcement that the
licenses in the restricted area will be
revoked, several liquor dealers now
in that area began negotiations for
the purchase of property between
Menlo Park and Atherton, and di
rectly adjoining Menlo School for
Boys, both of these districts being
more than a mile and a half from
the campus.
A fight in the assembly over the
Gilmore bill, which seeks to repeal
the mile Mid a half law, was ex
pected by members of the commit
tee on public morals, to which the
bill has been referred.
Mayor James E. Cooper of Menlo
Park said that he did not believe in
interfering with a fight between the
state board and the Supreme Court.
However, Mayor Cooper does main
tain, as he did a year ago, that the
mile and a half law is meaningless in
this day of rapid transportation, and
that if Stanford students want to
drink, and Menlo Park dealers want
to sell, the only result of revoking
the licenses will be a great hardship
on Menlo Park merchants.
