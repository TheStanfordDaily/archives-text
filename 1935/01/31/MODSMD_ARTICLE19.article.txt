Disak Hi:n:
have asked me lo outline for our readers an answer
to vour query, "What does Hie Daily think of having the
Executive Committee eontroJ its editorial policy?"
You have staled, and in this we agree conclusively, that
the Daily should make its position clear in this matter, and i
should very definitely inform the campus of its policy in'
reference to student affairs.
You personally state that you "disapprove entirely of
having the publishers [referring to the Executive Com
mittee | criticized by the Daily for their actions."
The following should serve to clarify your views on
these matters.
* * *
The Stam oiu) Daily is a campus newspaper, the official j
organ of the Associated Students. It has certain rcsponsi-'
Jjilities, tills a definite community function, and its activity
is toward that which will benefit the University.
In its efforts to attract and hold its readers it is restricted
by nothing but consideration of the community welfare, a
responsibility shared by every member of its staff.
Ihe Stanroan Daily believes that every newspaper j
should strive at all times for sincerity, truthfulness, and I
accuracy, it stands for impartiality in the presentation of
news, and offers its columns to those advocating either side
: of a case, regardless of its editorial stand.
j
We believe in fair play, in decency, and do not criticize
or condemn without prior investigation of the facts.
Any journalist who uses his power for any selfish or
otherwise unworthy purpose is faithless to a high trust; a
collegiate journalist not excepted.
Freedom of the press, regarded generally as a vital right
jot' mankind, is restricted only by fidelity to the public in
j terest.
I, The Stanford Daily does not propose to place this cam
pus back a few centuries, nor does it advocate any Fascistic i
method of control.
j|; ;{?
In regard to your specific query, then, I must Inform you j
that the Daily docs not believe its editorial policy should
be controlled by the Executive Committee. It should be!
added that an informal poll of that body indicates that the
Executive Committee does not wish that responsibility.
The Executive Committee, a handful of students, is not
the publisher of this newspaper. Some thirty-six hundred
engage in that function.
Furthermore, the Executive Committee probably could
never regularly agree on any set editorial policy, and the!
whole affair would be tossed right back into the lap of the
incumbent editor.
* * *
Should the Daily be free to criticize actions of the Ex
ecutive Committee?
That is one of the primary functions of this newspaper
if and when criticism is warranted. It is folly lo forget
that criticism can.be both good and bad, constructive and
destructive. The Daily criticizes only in the effort to pro-!
mote the best interests of this University.
A thorough perusal of every issue of the present volume j
will disclose not one instance where the Daily has departed j
,I'rom its policy of doing that which is best for the (jcnrral j
rather than for the individual good.
That policy is self-evident.
Our readers at all times are privileged and welcome to
make use of these columns lo tell their opinions.
The Daily is here lo serve this campus.
If and when it can no longer till that function properly
with its own staff of seventy students, it might then turn to
the eleven members of the Executive Committee for their
advice and counsel.
Sincerely,
Stan I>i;ai baiiu;, Editor j
