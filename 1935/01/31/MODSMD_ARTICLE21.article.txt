# Ex Committee Members Fail to Back Up Proposal To Control Daily Policy
## Student Manager in Favor Of Curtailment Of Editorial Ideas KAHN BACKS UP DAILY Opinion of Campus Leaders Tends To Support Paper 
### Irvin Jorgensen 
In an informal interview yesterday
between Student Manager Ben Cave,
and Stan Beaubaire, editor of The;
Daily, Cave suggested that the Ex
Committee should not be subject to
criticism on the part of The Daily.
Said he: "I disapprove entirely of
having the publishers of The Daily
(Ex Committee) criticized by The
Dailv for their actions."
He further suggested that The
Daily should state its opinion on
flic matter. Cave lias long con
tended that the Ex Committee, be
ing made up of the Chosen People
of the Associated Students, is the
publisher of The Daily and should
therefore have control over the
paper.
He maintaias that because The
Daily editor is elected after a fashion
by The Daily staff and the Ex Com
mittee is elected after a fashion by
the Associated Students, that the
committee is nearer to the heart
throbs and emotions of The People.
Heads Express Views
A telephone survey of Ex Com
mittee members who could be found
last night revealed that Cave's opin
ion was not supported in Ex Com
mittee, however. They said:
Marvie Kahn: "I've heard no
statement from Ben Cave or any
member of Ex Committee on that
subject and I've entertained no such
thought myself. I think The Daily
perfectly capable of running itself.
I think that the editorial policy, ex
cept in minor cases, has never been
unwise.
"If The Daily did contrary to
the aims of student government,
both the University and the AS.
S.U. should take steps. This im
plies no idea of curbing the free
dom of speech."
Vivian Kay: "No, I do not think
the editorial policy should be con
trolled by Ex Committee."
Barbara Holmes: "I think the edi
torial policies should be left to the
discretion of the editor and not dic
tated in any way by Ex Committee.
The editor should be entitled to use
hi s own judgment and opinion in his
editorial policies. Any other expres
sion of student opinion can be made
directly through the student opinion
columns of The Daily and should not
be regulated through the medium of
Ex Committee.'
Chuck Glasgow: "Ex Committee's
only reason in curtailing Daily ex
pression would be the committee's
fear of being exposed. That is why
] think the biggest value The Daily
can have is an absolutely free opin
ion. As long as The Daily gives un
biased opinion, unbiased reporting, it
is performing a real service, and the
editorial policy should not be in
fluenced by either Ex Committee or
others."
Bill Stark: ''I do wot think it
would be a good idea for the Ex
Committee to meddle with Daily
editorial policy, but I still think
you're getting too much money."
Moi't D'Evelyn: "If any organiza
tion should control the policies of The
Daily, the Ex Committee is certainly
not fitted for that function. I believe
it is, itself, too involved in student
affairs to be an impartial judge, a
position in which any newspaper
should be."
A1 Blackman: "Heck no! We don't
know anything about running The
Daily. I hope you're not getting any
gray hairs over that."
