# Board of Equalization And Another Mess
## 
### 
Tin.* Stale Hoard of Equalization has put its
foot in its mouth on so many occasions that
the innocent citizenry must he certainly won
dering how on earth they ever elected these
grotesque contortionists to do business in the
name of the State of California.
W'c have, it is admitted, many freaks in this
sovereign state. Some we laugh at, some we
curse at, and some, like the hoard, we can do
nothing hut shed tears over.
Yesterday this solemn pack of blockheads
heat a (puck retreat out of the Menlo liquor
dealers' mess, by discovering that it was
merely their mistake when they issued liquor
licenses in Menlo Park. Despite the long
wrangle that culminated in a State Supreme
Court decision on the subject, the Hoard of
Equalization.was unaware that liquor sales in
Menlo are, according to statute, unlawful.
170111 the time of its conception some
twenty-odd years ago, until the advent of the
sales tax and State liquor control in 1933, the
Hoard of Equalization had an innocent and
undistinguished task. Having nothing to do,
it was not blamed for doing it.
Now it Jias been saddled with a responsible
job, hid instead of attempting to administer it
like men, they have spent their oftiee hours
pussyfooting around in the bushes attempting
to leather their political nests.
This self-interest has resulted in a weak
and vacillating attitude, with decisions bob
bing around like hot potatoes at a Sunday
school picnic. It did work fairly well to the
advantage of the board members, who were
all returned, with one exception, to their seals
ilfler hitter and close battles in last fall's elec
tions.
At the beginning of the year a realignment
of the votes 011 the board, together with the
seating of a new member from Southern Cali
fornia, led the public to believe that some
reform had been accomplished, but it now
appears that the hopes were prematurely de
flated.
The board is composed of the same august
simpletons as of old; you can forgive a poli
tician when he fashions a dubious piece of
business with an end in view, but when it is
done because of sheer ignorance, it is hard to
excuse.
Members of the board must forget the po
litical scare of last summer; they would do
well to mend their ways or sutler certain de
feat next time, which although far in the tu
tu re, is sure to come.
And as for the Menlo business men, one can
express only sympathy. They are the scape
goats; but they are also the men who helped
put the Hoard of Equalization in ollicc. May
they know better, next lime.

name of the State of California.
W'c have, it is admitted, many freaks in this
sovereign state. Some we laugh at, some we
curse at, and some, like the hoard, we can do
nothing hut shed tears over.
Yesterday this solemn pack of blockheads
heat a (puck retreat out of the Menlo liquor
dealers' mess, by discovering that it was
merely their mistake when they issued liquor
licenses in Menlo Park. Despite the long
wrangle that culminated in a State Supreme
Court decision on the subject, the Hoard of
Equalization.was unaware that liquor sales in
Menlo are, according to statute, unlawful.
170111 the time of its conception some
twenty-odd years ago, until the advent of the
sales tax and State liquor control in 1933, the
Hoard of Equalization had an innocent and
undistinguished task. Having nothing to do,
it was not blamed for doing it.
Now it Jias been saddled with a responsible
job, hid instead of attempting to administer it
like men, they have spent their oftiee hours
pussyfooting around in the bushes attempting
to leather their political nests.
This self-interest has resulted in a weak
and vacillating attitude, with decisions bob
bing around like hot potatoes at a Sunday
school picnic. It did work fairly well to the
advantage of the board members, who were
all returned, with one exception, to their seals
ilfler hitter and close battles in last fall's elec
tions.
At the beginning of the year a realignment
of the votes 011 the board, together with the
seating of a new member from Southern Cali
fornia, led the public to believe that some
reform had been accomplished, but it now
appears that the hopes were prematurely de
flated.
The board is composed of the same august
simpletons as of old; you can forgive a poli
tician when he fashions a dubious piece of
business with an end in view, but when it is
done because of sheer ignorance, it is hard to
excuse.
Members of the board must forget the po
litical scare of last summer; they would do
well to mend their ways or sutler certain de
feat next time, which although far in the tu
tu re, is sure to come.
And as for the Menlo business men, one can
express only sympathy. They are the scape
goats; but they are also the men who helped
put the Hoard of Equalization in ollicc. May
they know better, next lime.
Tin.* Stale Hoard of Equalization has put its
foot in its mouth on so many occasions that
the innocent citizenry must he certainly won
dering how on earth they ever elected these
grotesque contortionists to do business in the
name of the State of California.
