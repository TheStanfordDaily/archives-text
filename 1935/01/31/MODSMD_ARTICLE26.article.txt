# Mr. Green and Unemployment
## 
### 
Again William (ireen, president of the
American Federation of Labor, comes tor
ward with bis pel and oft-repeated proposal
drastic slashes in working hours as a means
for relieving the unemployment problem.
There is no doubt but what shorter hours
would help the situation tremendously, pro
vided industry were able to shoulder the bur
den of extra payrolls. Hut it is this latter pro
viso that pretty effectively lands the whole
proposition on the rocks at Ibis stage of the
game. Business shows of creeping old
of the lethargy that has characterized it for
more than five years and anv drastic shorten

iii} 4 of hours and resulting increased payroll
initfht hand it a serious setback.
President Hoosevelt and responsible con
gressional leaders have repeatedly made
known their opposition to a 30-hour week
Green's prohahle objective at the present
time. Thev feel that the N.R.A. has shortened
hours enough for the present time.
Shortening of hours is the only logical solu
tion of technological unemployment in the
long run and future years will doubtless see
a continued reduction. Hut the time for that
will be when business is once more on the
high road, rolling along ;it a fairly mei rv clip,
not while it is just beginning to creep out of
the slough of depression.
