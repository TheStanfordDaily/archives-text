how the Nazis are caring for it. The German method

Nazis are in reality "National Socialists," and the
Socialist in their platform is illustrated by their whole
sale way of giving out employment and trying to
equc lize income. Americans may believe that employ
mem under SERA has in many cases become a propo
sitior. of "paid loafing," but look at Germany:
AM highways that need only the slightest daub
ing with tar, the smallest handful of dust, the most
insignificant surveying, are being tackled with force
and numbers. Workmen on the German highways
number almost a million. "Small wages paid to a
great number" is the German philosophy. The idea
of giving more people less wages so that no one wiil
starve but so that also no one will have two cars,
etc., is the Socialist in the National Socialist party.
Ali party members, around 6,000,000 of them, pay
exactly one mark and 80 pfennig per month as a con
tribution to pay for this employment. All members of
the German Labor Front, some millions now and still
growing, pay an amount based on their monthly income.
These contributions, theoretically voluntary, are based
on the assumption that it is a privilege to belong to the
party.
As an example of creating work: near Dresden there
is a cigarette factory that had in its employ until re
cently some 500 persons, 400 of them women. These 400
became engaged to marry some 400 gentlemen not all
at the same time but more or less concurrently. As was
the case then, each couple getting married received
coupons good for home furnishings to the sum of 1000
marks. This premium was given, however, only on the
condition that the bride-to-be was leaving a position
open for another person in her former job.
When the 400 women married the 400 men,
400,000 marks were spent by the government. 400
others took the jobs the 400 women had vacated,
400,000 nwrks got among the tradesmen for furni
ture, pots and pans, roofing, and diapers, and 400
couples must now decide whether they wish to pay
back the marks in taxes or if they want to produce
five, children in as many years and pay nothing.
If you wish to pay no income tax in Germany, get
to work and produce five children, single or in batches,
and you are free from making out an income tax return.
Figure this on the basis of population eight years from
now if the former 500 at Stanford had done the same.
How many students would there be in Cit? How many
additional tickets would the Stanford theater sell? How
many law libe contributions? How many checks pay
able to Stanford University? How many good football
players to subsidize? How much noise in Encina? How
much—oh, well, pleasant dreams.

400,000 marks were spent by the government. 400
others took the jobs the 400 women had vacated,
400,000 nwrks got among the tradesmen for furni
ture, pots and pans, roofing, and diapers, and 400
couples must now decide whether they wish to pay
back the marks in taxes or if they want to produce
five, children in as many years and pay nothing.
If you wish to pay no income tax in Germany, get
to work and produce five children, single or in batches,
and you are free from making out an income tax return.
Figure this on the basis of population eight years from
now if the former 500 at Stanford had done the same.
How many students would there be in Cit? How many
additional tickets would the Stanford theater sell? How
many law libe contributions? How many checks pay
able to Stanford University? How many good football
players to subsidize? How much noise in Encina? How
much—oh, well, pleasant dreams.
(Sidelights on the unemployment problem rind
how the Nazis are caring for it. The German method
closely paralleling our SERA, with minor varia
tions. "Raise five children and pay no income
fax . . . .")
Nazis are in reality "National Socialists," and the
Socialist in their platform is illustrated by their whole
sale way of giving out employment and trying to
equc lize income. Americans may believe that employ
mem under SERA has in many cases become a propo
sitior. of "paid loafing," but look at Germany:
AM highways that need only the slightest daub
ing with tar, the smallest handful of dust, the most
insignificant surveying, are being tackled with force
and numbers. Workmen on the German highways
number almost a million. "Small wages paid to a
great number" is the German philosophy. The idea
of giving more people less wages so that no one wiil
starve but so that also no one will have two cars,
etc., is the Socialist in the National Socialist party.
Ali party members, around 6,000,000 of them, pay
exactly one mark and 80 pfennig per month as a con
tribution to pay for this employment. All members of
the German Labor Front, some millions now and still
growing, pay an amount based on their monthly income.
These contributions, theoretically voluntary, are based
on the assumption that it is a privilege to belong to the
party.
As an example of creating work: near Dresden there
is a cigarette factory that had in its employ until re
cently some 500 persons, 400 of them women. These 400
became engaged to marry some 400 gentlemen not all
at the same time but more or less concurrently. As was
the case then, each couple getting married received
coupons good for home furnishings to the sum of 1000
marks. This premium was given, however, only on the
condition that the bride-to-be was leaving a position
open for another person in her former job.
When the 400 women married the 400 men,
400,000 marks were spent by the government. 400
others took the jobs the 400 women had vacated,
400,000 nwrks got among the tradesmen for furni
