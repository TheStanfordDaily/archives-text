## WITH PHILIP W. BUCK 
### John McClelland 
Three weeks of torrid debate in the Senate .ended.
Up came the bill for admission of the United States to
the World Court. Then down if went (o defeat as the
necessary two-thirds majority fell seven votes short.
The country gasped. It had been taken for granted that
Fioosevelt's nod was enough to put the bill across.
Philip Buck, instructor in political science, an
astute student of Congressional actions, sees in (he
surprise upset another demonstration of traditional
adherence to the Washingtonian policy of "keeping
clear of all foreign affairs."
He believes the public expected the bill to go through
and would have been pleased if it had, notwithstanding
the fact that the senators were flooded with telegrams
Tuesday crying "vote no."
"The Senate does not necessarily reflect public
opinion," Buck says. "Instead it reflects the personal
interests of that body itself, who, by reason of their
long terms, feel fairly free to do as they please despite
pressure from home. In this instance the Senate merely
expressed deep rooted prejudice more than anything
else."
The few renegade democrats who foiled to line
up behind the President—"wild men" as Buck de
scribes them—can be held responsible for the defeat.
The interest of the section apparently outweighed
the interests of the party as far as these men were
concerned.
All things considered, nevertheless, it is hard to
understand why 36 senators would see fit to vote
against the measure. The terms under which the U. S.
would enter, if it did enter, were more than liberal.
They provided that this country could enter and accept
the jurisdiction of the court as long as it liked and then,
if a question arose which it didn't like, it could with
draw gracefully without creating any hard feelings, a
sort of "we'll play games as long as we like them but
if something crosses us we'll go home and nobody will
be mad." But no terms were liberal enough for 36
reactionary senators.
"Not much is lost or gained, however," Buck
explains, "because if we had entered the court
under these terms it would not have meant mem
bership in the sense that most nations consider it."
It was a mid-west senatorial block which swung
the tide. Five democrats, eight republicans fell in with
the minority which won the battle. Mid-westerners,
isolated as they are from direct contact with all that is
foreign, could hardly be expected to do otherwise. But
from the solid south, where there are no republican
senators, eight New Dealers turned thumbs down. Nine
other dissenters from the far West and eight from the
Northeast completed the rout.
Tuesday's rejection was the president's third legis
lative defeat since he has been in office. Some may in
terpret it. as a rebellion within the ranks. At any rate,
it Is something to cause grave concern to the nation's
chief.

It was a mid-west senatorial block which swung
the tide. Five democrats, eight republicans fell in with
the minority which won the battle. Mid-westerners,
isolated as they are from direct contact with all that is
foreign, could hardly be expected to do otherwise. But
from the solid south, where there are no republican
senators, eight New Dealers turned thumbs down. Nine
other dissenters from the far West and eight from the
Northeast completed the rout.
Tuesday's rejection was the president's third legis

Up came the bill for admission of the United States to
the World Court. Then down if went (o defeat as the
necessary two-thirds majority fell seven votes short.
The country gasped. It had been taken for granted that
Fioosevelt's nod was enough to put the bill across.
Philip Buck, instructor in political science, an
astute student of Congressional actions, sees in (he
surprise upset another demonstration of traditional
adherence to the Washingtonian policy of "keeping
clear of all foreign affairs."
He believes the public expected the bill to go through
and would have been pleased if it had, notwithstanding
the fact that the senators were flooded with telegrams
Tuesday crying "vote no."
"The Senate does not necessarily reflect public
opinion," Buck says. "Instead it reflects the personal
interests of that body itself, who, by reason of their
long terms, feel fairly free to do as they please despite
pressure from home. In this instance the Senate merely
expressed deep rooted prejudice more than anything
else."
The few renegade democrats who foiled to line
up behind the President—"wild men" as Buck de
scribes them—can be held responsible for the defeat.
The interest of the section apparently outweighed
the interests of the party as far as these men were
concerned.
All things considered, nevertheless, it is hard to
understand why 36 senators would see fit to vote
against the measure. The terms under which the U. S.
would enter, if it did enter, were more than liberal.
They provided that this country could enter and accept
the jurisdiction of the court as long as it liked and then,
if a question arose which it didn't like, it could with
draw gracefully without creating any hard feelings, a
sort of "we'll play games as long as we like them but
if something crosses us we'll go home and nobody will
be mad." But no terms were liberal enough for 36
reactionary senators.
