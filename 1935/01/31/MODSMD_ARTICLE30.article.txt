# CAMPUS OPINION
## "STUDENTS WILL ALWAYS DRINK" 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
May we quote from an article in
the last issue of the Saturday Eve
ning Post written by Dean Fred H. j
Turner of the University of Illinois?
The article is entitled "Students of
the Depression."
"Then came the hard liquor. Thera
was an old state law which barred
the sale of liquor within four miles j
of the campus. That law went by :
the board with all the others. Liquor
is sold in the community and any
adult can purchase it. The bootleg- 1
gers are out of the picture, or at
least they seem to be.
"Now get me straight on this: j
we have about ten thousand stu- j
dents. We know that some of
them are going to drink. We re
gret it, hut we know they will, j
We know that some of them will I
get into trouble with the l;vw and
with university discipline. We ;
know that some of them will be
fired from the university for !
drinking and intoxication. We also
know that the favorite drink before
repeal was spiked beer. That was i
near beer with the neck and an i
inch in the bottle poured out. |
filled to the top with alcohol, and !
then .shaken and consumed.
"We know that men became se- |

riously ill once in a while from
drinking the stuff. We also knew
that men bought liquor from the boot
leggers at times which knocked them
cold as fish and oftentimes left them
terribly sick. We knew that social
events were occasionally spoiled by
smarties who thought they had to
have a little bootleg liquor.
"Well, since the change we have
had about the same number of dis
ciplinary cases involving liquor, with
a slight improvement in the last few
months. We have had none of the
terribly poisoned youngsters who
foolishly bought bootlegg gin and
mixed it in wash boilers. The fra
ternity parties and social functions
have been freer of liquor than they
were before. This is the picture as
it is here.
"I'm no idealist about the liquor
situation . . . my own observation is
that our student body has taken the
repeal of prohibition much more
sensibly than have the same num
ber of adults of twice their age. And
from what I can learn that seems to
hold for a good many colleges and
universities."

"Now get me straight on this: j
we have about ten thousand stu- j
dents. We know that some of
them are going to drink. We re
gret it, hut we know they will, j
We know that some of them will I
get into trouble with the l;vw and
with university discipline. We ;
know that some of them will be
fired from the university for !
drinking and intoxication. We also
know that the favorite drink before
repeal was spiked beer. That was i
near beer with the neck and an i
inch in the bottle poured out. |
filled to the top with alcohol, and !
then .shaken and consumed.
"We know that men became se- |

riously ill once in a while from
drinking the stuff. We also knew
that men bought liquor from the boot
leggers at times which knocked them
cold as fish and oftentimes left them
terribly sick. We knew that social
events were occasionally spoiled by
smarties who thought they had to
have a little bootleg liquor.
"Well, since the change we have
had about the same number of dis
ciplinary cases involving liquor, with
a slight improvement in the last few
months. We have had none of the
terribly poisoned youngsters who
foolishly bought bootlegg gin and
mixed it in wash boilers. The fra
ternity parties and social functions
have been freer of liquor than they
were before. This is the picture as
it is here.
"I'm no idealist about the liquor
situation . . . my own observation is
that our student body has taken the
repeal of prohibition much more
sensibly than have the same num

from what I can learn that seems to
hold for a good many colleges and
universities."

The Editor, Sir:
May we quote from an article in
the last issue of the Saturday Eve
ning Post written by Dean Fred H. j
Turner of the University of Illinois?
The article is entitled "Students of
the Depression."
"Then came the hard liquor. Thera
was an old state law which barred
the sale of liquor within four miles j
of the campus. That law went by :
the board with all the others. Liquor
is sold in the community and any
adult can purchase it. The bootleg- 1
gers are out of the picture, or at
least they seem to be.
