# CORRECTION CONCERNING HITLER
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
These articles on Hitler and Nazi
isrrr in each of the two last Dailies
seem to me to be assininely simple
and uninformed. Anyone tracing Hit
ler's rise would realize that at the
time that Hitler came into power ho
gained power by coalition with the
Nationalists which gave him 52 per
cent of the German votes.
Hitler proceeded by methods of
terrorism through his Storm Troop
ers to intimidate the German people
who opposed him; consequently be
cause of fear, many Germans give |

lip-agreement to Hitler. It is this !
that enables him to turn in such ,
large majorities as 95 per cent of!
the votes.
Moreover, there are many voters — [
Communists and the like—who have
been disfranchised. Thi.s is briefly j
; a correction of some of the glaring \
errors in the articles. I would sug- [
gest that their author, in order to J
inform himself on the subject, ei- j
ther read Calvin Hoover's ''Germany |
Enters the Third Reich" or else en- j
roll in Modern German (history
j 148). Dewey Davis
