# NEWLY-MADE WESTERNER SPEAKS
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
I suppose too much attention
should not be paid to the self-styled
"lover of better things," for usually
a man of true culture will let his
actions and words speak for them
selves and does not try to label them
acts of culture.
But it seems hardly logical to con
demn the West on the score that San
Francisco has a certain number of
night clubs, and a number that New
York could equal easily. One had
better compare like to like, and if

. the balance is an unfavorable one
: then, surely there is no need for j
anyone to stay in such an "uncul- j
tured" atmosphere.
The culture of the East should ;
teach a little grammar on the side, j
and especially in those cases where j
the incorrect usage is to be empha.- j
sized by black print.
Perhaps culture includes the abil- |
1 ity to enjoy many kinds of things, !
and then again, perhaps the West j
shouldn't try to lower the high stand- j
aids of the "New Yorker."
