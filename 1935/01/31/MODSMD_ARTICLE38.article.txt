## RUGBY IS GETTING BETTER ATTENDANCE 
### 
An improvement in the attendance
at rugby games on the campus lias
been noticed during the past three
weeks of play. It is almost getting so
a lew spectators know when a score
is being made, and a very select
group even know how many points
were scored by such and such a play.
All of which indicates that the old
English sport is gaining in popular
ity, and has approached the stage
where it should become at least a
minor sport.
The present crop of Cardinal
ruggers are playing purely for the
love of the game, and they all do
claim that it is a great game. The
oretically, of course, all athletes
participate for the love of their
particular sport, hut most of them
get awards in the form of block
or circle letters. Itugby players
don't even gel that.
Since circle letters are given to
soccer players, and blocks to Amer
ican football contestants, why not
some token to ruggers, who play a
combination of the two sports. Offi
cial rugby recognition by the Board
of Athletic Control would be a de
sirable thing.
