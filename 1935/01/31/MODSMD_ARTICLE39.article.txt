# COULD USE STADIUM FOR GAME SATURDAY
## 
### 
While we're on that tack, we
might just as well clamor for some
more concessions to rugby. Coaches
Harry Maloney and Jim Wylie send
their Indian fifteen into action here
Saturday against the San Francisco
University Dons, one of the power
ful teams of the Bay Region.
The point is that this game is
hound to draw one of the big
winter season sporting crowds, and
could handle a fair-sized throng
much better in the Stadium, un
used since the Olympic Club grid
game early in November,
The Indians have already won
three Northern California Rugby
Union games, and will make a bid
for the league title, contested partly
by California, and also by San
Francisco.
Saturday's game promises to be
close, one way or the other, and will
match some of the best backs the
rapidly reviving game can claim in
this part of the country. Johnny
Reisner, Joe Vigna, Ray Lewis, and
Fred Abbott will match running and
passing against a strong Don combi
nation led by one Hinch, who was
heard from on the American football
field.
Coach Jimmy Bradshaw and his
potent combination of frosh basket
bailers have all sorts of ideas con
cerning their game with the Univer
sity of California yearlings. Suffice
it to say that California was some
what fortunate to win from the Santa
Clara frosh, who fell to Stanford, 73
to 24, last Saturday, and that the In
dians will be nicely favored over the
Cubs.
Besides a clean sweep of their
litlle big series, the Cardinal babes
have some notion of a scoring record,
which is all very possible, just in
case Stanford is as warm when in
the vicinity of the basket as she was
last week-end, also in case the Bears
are just a trifle up in the air about
the whole thing.
—Browne.
