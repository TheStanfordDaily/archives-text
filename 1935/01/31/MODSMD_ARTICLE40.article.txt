# New Indian Quintet Seeks Revenge over Cal Tomorrow Night
## Turner, Quade, Lindsey In New Regular Jobs For Conference Clash 
### Mort D'Evelyn 
More scrimmage against the Cal
type of offense and defense last night
gave the revised-Indian quintet fur
ther opportunity to get the "feel" of
working with each other for tomor
row night's return game with the
Bear hoopsters in the Pavilion.
Apparently it will again be a
case of the smaller, but possibly
faster Stanford basketball team
versus a California quintet which
seems almost giant-like in compar
ison.
With Howell Turner playing the
center position previously held down
by Ken Nobs and Keith Topping,
the Indians will be without a man to
match the height and weight of either
Captain Dave Meek or Bob Herwig
of the Bears, a distinct disadvantage,
during the underbucket play.
With Bill Quade and Robin Lind
sey definitely among the starters,
however, the Cards will have a com
bination playing the smoothest floor
game this season. Lindsay has been
playing considerably as a substitute
in the league games to date, while
Quade played with Turner and guard
Dinty Moore last season as a frosh.
Coach Nibs Price of Cal has been
sticking with the same lineup which
decisively defeated (he Cards three
weeks agoâ€”Olsen and Kopke, for
wards; Meek, center; and Feiling
and Herwig, guards.
Tuesday night Coach John Bunn
took his first stringers to San Fran
cisco to watch the Olympic Club play
the Bears, but Price was content to
rest his regulars for Friday night and
take a whipping.
Saturday night Stanford will meet
Santa Clara in another Pavilion game.
Coach Harlan Dykes' men have lost
but two games this season, once to
the Trojans and once to California.
In Eckman and Ethan, forwards,
Goodell, center, and Otten and Ban
non, guards, the Broncos have their
best team in history, a five which
gained a Santa Clara victory over
S.F.U. for the first time in 11 years.
