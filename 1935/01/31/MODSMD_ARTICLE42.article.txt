# Rugby Team Meets Dons
## 
### 
American football tactics will be ;
in prevalence Saturday afternoon 1
when the U.S.F. ruggers come down j
for their little rendezvous with the j
Card fifteen.
At least a dozen of the thirty who i
will be on the field were footballers I
last fall, and some of them were j
stars. Men like Frank Alustiza, Jack ;
Walton, Johnnie Reisner, Bill Hinch,
Pop Blewett, and Ray Petersen, the
last three being Dons, all saw action
on the grid.
The more British features of the I
game, such as cross-kicking, lateral ,
passing, and drop-kicking on the run i
are not at this date as impressive to j
the college fellows as the idea of'
grabbing the ball and crossing the i
line with it. Captain Roger Hager. I
Frank Ingersoll, and Marvin Taylor i
in the rear rank, Dick Becker and |
Jim Mullen in the second rank, and
Jack Walton, Jerry Peters, and Dick j
Morrison in the front rank are the j
boys who lock arms and push to the j
best advantage.
