Bradshaw Optimistic
After outlining the California mode
of play in a short chalk talk. Brad
! Shaw sent his first stringers through
j an extensive practice session against
a squad of reserves trained to carry
| out the California grape-vine type of
I offense. The Stanford coach ex
pressed the belief that his men would
j be able to cope with the Bear system
j in good order.
I Tuesday night the Cubs went down
in defeat at the hands of San Mateo
Junior College, 32-14. The score of
, this game is hardly indicative of the
Bears' strength, as their first string
! played only the first eight minutes of
j competition, and at the end of this
time had a good lead. Coach Bill
Higgins chose to send his second
! team in to finish the tilt.
Practice Fast Break
Yesterday the Stanford quintet
{topped off its defensive and offens
| ive drill with a scrimmage session
intended to give the frosh a chance
to work on the fast break which
will probably be the main source of
Indian power tomorrow.
j In this play H. B. Lee and Nelly
Heath, guards, are employed to re
-1 cover and pass the ball down the
court to forwards Clarence Maurer
'and Hank Luisetti who are in shoot
| ing territory.
