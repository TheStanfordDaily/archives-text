Erratic infielding and sloppy base

1 defeat at the hands of the Kenealy i
I Seals in the sunken diamond yester- j
day.
Joe Cronin, new manager of the
Boston Red Sox and former leader I
of the Washington Senators in the j
American League, was the fea
ture attraction -it second base and
shortstop for the Seals. His con
tribution for the afternoon was one
hit, one run, and two errors.
The Seals started early and made !
three runs on as many hits in the J
first inning. A long double by Dahl- ]
gren brought in all three of these j
j runs.
The Cardinals scored twice in
the third and again in the sixth. I
Archie Zamloch led the Stanford
batsmen with a pair of doubles,
| neither of which produced a score.
[ The Indians threatened a late rally i
, in the ninth when Larry Marshall :
j singled, then tried to stretch Fred
Heringer's single for two bases and j
was ousted. Zamloch advanced Her
; inger, but Kuykendall of the club J
i settled down and forced Gordy Mala- ;
tratt into flying out.
