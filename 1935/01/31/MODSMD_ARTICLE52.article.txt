# BEAR TRACKSTERS LOOM AS THREAT TO INDIAN HOPES
## Nine Meets Scheduled for Stanford; Big Meet On May 18 
### Phil Duffy 
With the Big Meet written in large
letters for April 20, and the Bear i
threat looming larger thap it hns I
since 1925, Stanford's cindermen ar'.* i
hard at work each day on Angell l
Field, in preparation for the coming
track season.
The complete schedule as released 1
by the B.A.C. embodies nine meets,!
commencing with the University of j
San Francisco on March 23 and end- !
ing with a four way meet at Cali- j
fornia on May 18.
Bears Win in '23
California has not won a Big Meet
since 1923 when the Berkeleyites |
succeeded in swamping the Cards j
82Mj to 48*4. In 1925 with the teams j
pretty much on par Dink Temple- •
ton's squad eked out a GG'A to 64 1 / i; >
victory. That was the last big threat
of the Bear tracksters.
This year, however, the Hamilton
men present a serious problem tc j
Stanford's success. Pre-season dope j
gives the Bears a slight edge. With 1
George Anderson, the sensational
sprinter* Hamilton is almost certain j
of a continued first place in that j
department. * j
The Bears have four good hurdlers {
and are certain to garner numerous j
points in both the highs and the I
lows, regardless of whether Sam '
Klopstock wins both races. In the
pole-vault Stanford is sadly weak,
and Cal is again strong.
Cards Strong on Field
However Cardinal strength begins i
to show up in the distance races and \
the field events. Concentration on !
these events will probably bring an- !
other Big Meet victory to the Farm, j
The meet is a long way off and the i
showing of both universities in pre
meets will have much more bearing
on the outcome of this annual clash.
Following is the schedule. Unless
otherwise indicated the meets will
be held at Stanford:

of the Bear tracksters.
This year, however, the Hamilton
men present a serious problem tc j
Stanford's success. Pre-season dope j
gives the Bears a slight edge. With 1
George Anderson, the sensational

of a continued first place in that j
department. * j
The Bears have four good hurdlers {
and are certain to garner numerous j
points in both the highs and the I
lows, regardless of whether Sam '
Klopstock wins both races. In the
pole-vault Stanford is sadly weak,

Cards Strong on Field
However Cardinal strength begins i
to show up in the distance races and \
the field events. Concentration on !
these events will probably bring an- !

on the outcome of this annual clash.
