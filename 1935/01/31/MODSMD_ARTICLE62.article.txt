# Morning Classes, Paper Fill Chinese Editor 's Day
## 
### Harriet Smith 
There are probably few city news
paper editors who edit a daily paper
' and go to school, yet one San Fran
| cisco editor finds time to drive down
lrom the city every morning for eight
: o'clock class at Stanford live days
a week. He is Churchill T. Chiu, edi
| tor of the Chinese Times, a daily af
| ternoon paper with a circulation of
8500.
Printed in the Chinese language,
this paper is the second largest of
its kind in this country and the
circulation embraces a wide field,
j The Times covers the same news
i field as other daily city papers be
sides maintaining correspondents
| in China and covering all the local
] news of Chinatown.
Enrolled in the journalism division
i of Stanford, Chiu has reversed the
I process of most of the would-be edi-
I tors studying in the department. He
' has edited the Times for over six
I years and now he is back to study
I journalism as it is taught in college.
He .spends the mornings attending
i classes and then returns to San
j Francisco and devotes the afternoon
j to editing his paper.
; Chiu was born in China and was
| graduated from the Canton Teach-
J ers College in 1920 after which he
I taught school and later served as the
j Supervisor of Schools for the city
I of Canton. He spent two years in
Peking where he served in the Min
istry of Communications as Commis-
I sioner for Education of the Railway
' Workers.
Ten years ago Chiu came to the
United States for the first time, and
after obtaining his A.IS. degree in
psychology at the University of
California and doing some post-
I graduate work he became editor

of the Times.
Editing a paper and attending!
classes are not all that keeps Chiu j
busy. He is principal of the Chinese j
Evening High School in San Fran- j
cisco and devotes a great deal of time
to the educational problems of his!
countrymen. Hp is also president of i
the Chinese General Peace Associa
tion, an organization for the Chinese
in California. This Association arbi- |
trates and conciliates for the Chinese I
of all the Pacific Coast. One of its j
chief aims is the elimination of Chi
nese tong wars. I

There are probably few city news
paper editors who edit a daily paper
' and go to school, yet one San Fran
| cisco editor finds time to drive down
lrom the city every morning for eight
: o'clock class at Stanford live days
a week. He is Churchill T. Chiu, edi
| tor of the Chinese Times, a daily af
| ternoon paper with a circulation of
8500.
Printed in the Chinese language,
this paper is the second largest of
its kind in this country and the
circulation embraces a wide field,
j The Times covers the same news
i field as other daily city papers be
sides maintaining correspondents
| in China and covering all the local
] news of Chinatown.
Enrolled in the journalism division
i of Stanford, Chiu has reversed the
I process of most of the would-be edi-
I tors studying in the department. He
' has edited the Times for over six
I years and now he is back to study
I journalism as it is taught in college.
He .spends the mornings attending
i classes and then returns to San
j Francisco and devotes the afternoon
j to editing his paper.
; Chiu was born in China and was
| graduated from the Canton Teach-
J ers College in 1920 after which he
I taught school and later served as the
j Supervisor of Schools for the city
I of Canton. He spent two years in
Peking where he served in the Min
istry of Communications as Commis-
I sioner for Education of the Railway
' Workers.
Ten years ago Chiu came to the
United States for the first time, and
after obtaining his A.IS. degree in
psychology at the University of
California and doing some post-
I graduate work he became editor

of the Times.
Editing a paper and attending!
classes are not all that keeps Chiu j
busy. He is principal of the Chinese j
Evening High School in San Fran- j
cisco and devotes a great deal of time
to the educational problems of his!
countrymen. Hp is also president of i
the Chinese General Peace Associa
tion, an organization for the Chinese
in California. This Association arbi- |
trates and conciliates for the Chinese I
of all the Pacific Coast. One of its j
chief aims is the elimination of Chi
nese tong wars. I
