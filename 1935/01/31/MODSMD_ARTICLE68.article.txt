jAI Piiotolith Travelogue: Copy for
photolith reproduction may be set in type or may be type
written (the Press has installed a battery of special type
writers), and may include line drawings or photographs in
any combination. This copy is photographed on to a nega
tive using a built-in camera designed especially for photolith
work. A picture as large as 20X24 inches may be made. A
zinc plate, chemically etched and sensitized, is then exposed
to the negative, as shown at the right. The plate is developed
and put on a latest-type Harris offset press, shown above,
and copies may be printed at a rate as high as 6,000 an hour.
The Press offers the service of this photolith equipment
and its trained artisans as a result of the increasing and vari
able demands for fine reproduction on the Stanford Cam
pus, and invites the consideration of your special printing
problems.
STANFORD
UNIVERSITY
PRESS

-Aldequate publication and
printing servicc for Stanford University and
the campus publications has been the constant
aim of the Press. In keeping with this aim,
photolith equipment, opening up an entirely
new field, was installed last summer. Begin
ning with the publication of syllabi and out
of-print books, continuous and increasing use
has been made of it.
With the opening of school in the fall came
the opportunity to adapt photolith to alumni
and student publications. A special insert of
campus views has been a feature of the fall
numbers of the Illustrated Review, and the
Football Weekly carried the news of the
games to the alumni. A fine campus map, in
color, by Professor Farmer was published just
before Christmas (see it at the Bookstore).
Fraternities and sororities will find photolith
an ideal way to prepare good-looking and in
expensive House Letters, as did Sigma Chi.
Chappie, the Old Boy himself, finds photolith
an excellent aid in maintaining his outstand
ing record of a sellout of every number this
year.
And now congratulations to the Dailyâ€”
may the use of photolith add to
its prestige.and pros
perity.
