## Wagner Selection, Trumpet Solo Highlights 
### Barbara Sweet 
j Revealing considerable benefit
i from their four months practice, the
Stanford Band, Glee Club, and Sym
! phony Orchestra last night gave a
i commendable performance, although
it is doubtful if it justified their in
; elusion on the A.S.S.U. Concert Se
l lies schedule.
Best of the four groups on the
j program was the last, the glee
| club-orchestra combination. The
i "Battle Hymn" from Wagner's
â€¢ Rietizi was their outstanding num
ber. although the poor accoustics
of the Pavilion and the position of
the singers behind the orchestra
tended to diminish their volume
considerably.
The opening number by the band
was an unfortunate choice. Although
,it was technically well-executed,
such a tone poem as Sibelius' *'Fin
landia" needs the softening influence
of stringed instruments to appear at
its best. On the other hand the two
numbers that followed, especially
! the cornet solo by Charles Bubb,
: were a pleasing contrast.
j The symphony selections seemed
to suffer from the same trouble. The
1 first number, the Tschaikowsky fi
| nale, was grating and harsh, while the
next two selections, emphasizing the
i strings, were pleasing and well re
[ ceived.
