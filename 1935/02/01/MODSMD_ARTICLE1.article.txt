"exhibition" wrestling! match put on
by two master showmen in the oer
sons of Jack Walton and Bob Rey

terful interpretation of the antics of
professional grunt and groan artists.
The boys went through a complete
repertoire of body slams, spins, flying
tackles, and groans, and wound up
the show with an 'impressive airplane
spin.
