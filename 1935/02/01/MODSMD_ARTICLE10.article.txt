# HIGH PRAISE OF CAMPUS DRAMA GIVEN BY GRAY
## 'Her Master s Voice' Rated Equal to Former Plays Of Miss Kummer 
### Annlee Whitmore 
High praise of "Her Master's !
Voice," gay comedy to be presented '
February 8 in the Stanford assembly ,
hall, was issued yesterday by Pro- !
fessor Henry D. Gray of the English
department. Clare Kummer, author, j
he declared to be outstanding in the |
field of light dramas.
"In New York," Â«said Gray, "when i
Miss Rummer's first play, "Good i
Gracious Annabelle," came out, it !
was received with surprise and de- '
light by the audience. They found j.
her work fresh, sweet, and charming, j
a type hitherto unknown on Broad
way."
Suitable for Stanford
The farce is particularly well
suited to Stanford theatregoers, con - !
siders Professor Gray. Its action is ;
swift, its lines humorous, and the |
entire plot one unusually likely to
piease college students.
"That same pleasant impression of'
charm, her her fresh- j
ness and originality, was well sus
tained by her succeeding comedies,'
"Be Calm, Camilla," and "A Success
ful Calamity," and has been main- j
tained through the popular and suc
cessful "Rollo's Wild Cat."
"Those who know Miss Kummer's
work will anticipate a thoroughly ;
enjoyable evening when this last
successful play is presented."
Dialogue Exceptional
Professor Gray was particularly |
enthusiastic about the witty dialogue ;
of the playright's works.
"With however much respect and
interest one listens to more serious
drama, a Stanford audience is par
ticularly appreciative of a cheerful ;
and natural comedy," he remarked, j
"1 expect "Her Master's Voice" to be
received with great pleasure."
Mail Orders Now
The production is slated for Feb
ruary 8, at 8:15 o'clock. Mail orders
are now being filled; campus seat
sale will begin Monday.
The play had a successful season
on Broadway last year, surnassing
the author's previous works in box
office returns, and was selected as
one of the two best comedies of the '
year.
