Let tluiM.' who have always imagined Communists to he bearded, hu
morless, vulgar creatures revise their opinions.
"Fear," the Soviet drama hy Alexander Afinogenyev which Sword
and Sandals read in the Little Theatre last night, is an excellently eon
strutted, witty, vital piece 01 theatrical writing. It is a piay filled with

♦ new vision, new hope. Of course
it has a "message"; all Russian prod
ucts nowadays have. But that does
n't detract one whit from its interest.
Paul Crary was excellent as the
old professor who charges that fear
I is the underlying motive activating
citizens of the Soviet. His was the
| role of a pure scientist who resents
, -he attempt to turn science into an
I instrument of th? class struggle, but
; who finally sees the new vision. He
seemed to fit the part almost per
fectly.
Head Shows Well
; Sidney Head was equally adept as
Kastalsky, the professor's assistant
who urges him on, only to turn
j against him in the end.
In the feminine roles, Phyllis Cor
! son, a newcomer, turned in a really
praiseworthy performance as Klara,
a woman who has been with the
party from the first moments of the
Revolution.
Caroline Houseman almost stole
the show as the daughter of Tsck
hovoi and an ardent Young Com
munist. She had the comedy lines
of the evening, and the character
ization, that of a young girl who
should he playing with dolls but
is preoccupied with reports on the
; Five Year Plan, was amusingly
whimsical.
James Benet, playing the part of
Tsekhovoi, and Jean Albertson as his
wife, Elena, gave their usual pol
' ished performances.
Newcomer Promising
Drayton Bryant and Curtis Barnes
were fair in their parts, the latter
showing much promise as a new
comer. Others in the cast included
Robert Moore, Carter Meyer, Roger
| Pryor, Josephine Avis, Marian Wet
: more, and Virginia SwafTord.
Robert Dwan, who directed and
read stage directions, did a good job
in the former capacity, especially in
: view of the short rehearsal period,
! only one week. A little slowness on
the part of some in picking up cues
i was the most noticeable fault, but
I this, also, was caused by the haste of
Let tluiM.' who have always imagined Communists to he bearded, hu

James Benet, playing the part of
Tsekhovoi, and Jean Albertson as his
wife, Elena, gave their usual pol

Newcomer Promising
Drayton Bryant and Curtis Barnes
were fair in their parts, the latter
showing much promise as a new
comer. Others in the cast included
Robert Moore, Carter Meyer, Roger
| Pryor, Josephine Avis, Marian Wet
: more, and Virginia SwafTord.
Robert Dwan, who directed and
read stage directions, did a good job
in the former capacity, especially in
: view of the short rehearsal period,
! only one week. A little slowness on
the part of some in picking up cues

"Fear," the Soviet drama hy Alexander Afinogenyev which Sword
and Sandals read in the Little Theatre last night, is an excellently eon
strutted, witty, vital piece 01 theatrical writing. It is a piay filled with

♦ new vision, new hope. Of course
it has a "message"; all Russian prod
ucts nowadays have. But that does
n't detract one whit from its interest.
Paul Crary was excellent as the
old professor who charges that fear
I is the underlying motive activating
citizens of the Soviet. His was the
| role of a pure scientist who resents
, -he attempt to turn science into an
I instrument of th? class struggle, but
; who finally sees the new vision. He
seemed to fit the part almost per
fectly.
Head Shows Well
; Sidney Head was equally adept as
Kastalsky, the professor's assistant
who urges him on, only to turn
j against him in the end.
In the feminine roles, Phyllis Cor
! son, a newcomer, turned in a really
praiseworthy performance as Klara,
a woman who has been with the
party from the first moments of the
Revolution.
Caroline Houseman almost stole
the show as the daughter of Tsck
hovoi and an ardent Young Com
munist. She had the comedy lines
of the evening, and the character
ization, that of a young girl who
should he playing with dolls but
is preoccupied with reports on the
; Five Year Plan, was amusingly
whimsical.
