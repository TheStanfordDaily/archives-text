worthwhile addition to The Daily
and should be continued at regular
intervals."

man class president, "I thought the
section was really very good."
Marion Storey, Union sponsor, (
adds: "The faculty and students
would find such an addition to The
Daily an interesting way to keep up
with campus happenings; for Stan
ford subscribeis faraway it would be
invaluable in maintaining a tie with j

J the University."
"The photolith section proves that
The Daily can admirably use the
! contested 15 cents," says A1 Black
man. Ex Committee member. "1 hope
j this section can be incorporated as j
a permanent part of The Daily to
appear as many times as possible. I
The alumni and families of students I
at Stanford will especially appre
j ciate such an added feature. Let's
' see some more photolith editions!"
Jim Triolo, senior president, says:
"The Daily is to be complimented on
( its originality, at the manner in
; which it gave the campus its first
photolith section. It was novel, the
I pictures were well selected, and I'm
j glad to see that they could get out
one issue of The Daily without using
j Kahn's picture."
