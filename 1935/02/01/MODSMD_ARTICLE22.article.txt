cerned, h,v virtue of our priority

Drys were further heartened yes
terday by the announcement of How
ard jliui a move is now on to" re
open the question of zoning against
'liquor in the area of Menlo Park.
The San Mateo Times also added
i the force of its editorial influence in
: aiding the anti-liquor factions. In
; an editorial under the title "Liquoi
near Stanford, the San Mateo news
paper said:
". . . of course conditions have
changed a good deal since the one
and a half mile radius law was
enacted. Those were the days be
fore automobiles, when Stanford
, youths would hesitate to walk that
iar for a of beer. Today the
[ automobile lias brought the world
a good deal closer together, and
the mile and a half radius law, as
a practical thing, has little deter
rent value in (he service of liquor
to Stanford students.
i "The seventeen liquor permits is
sued by the state board for the ter
ritory within the mile and a half
radius therefore will probably be re
voked in the near future."
Frank Kecsling, attorney for the
State Board of Equalization, yester
day brought the controversy to a
head with the statement that all
liquor licenses that were issued for
19C5 in the piohibited mile and a
half zone would be cancelled. If
this move is carried out, it will not
only affect Menlo dealers, but North
1 Palo Alto as well.
