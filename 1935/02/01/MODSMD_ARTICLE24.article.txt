"This proves Chappie's versatility,"
says Steedman.
"Tremendous Task"
In awarding first place, the Kitty

in the field. Editor Gordon Steedman
was faced with the tremendous task
this year of filling the shoes of his
artist-predecessor, Jim Algar.
"To say that he has succeeded is
putting it mildly. New artists, gag
men, and feature writers seem to be
fairly flooding the Stanford campus.
With a large staff, splendid art work
and nice make-up, Steedman's book
is outstanding."
