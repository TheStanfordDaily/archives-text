# One Californian Who Is Asking for It
## 
### 
Over across the buy, there's a peculiar and
olttimes friendly spot known to the general
public variously as "(Lai," "Berkeley," "Cali
fornia," or something of that sort.
They have a newspaper, issued live times
('.ich week, modestly dubbed at the to]) ol
the editorial page (by its stall) Monarch of
Ihe College Doilies.
This Grand and Stupendous Organ ol' the
People of California ranks fairly well among
ils contemporaries, and aside from occasional
slumps into adolescence, dishes up the news
fairly regularly. It is about half the size of
the Dailg mini at the t'niversity of Illinois.
Which means nothing, because we are told
that "size don't cot* it."
( * * *
This Dailg California!!, as it is called, boasts
of having on ils stall' one foolhardy young
scribe frequently referred to in polite circles
as Davis Paul A. Davis.
Young Davis, bemoaning the fact that Cali
fornia has lost some basketball to the Terrible
Trojans, has hit upon an excellent idea.
lie believes that a new song should be writ
ten about Southern California, that all the
rooters could sing. Something like the "Card
inals Be Damned," only much worse.
hi fact, he asks that .California rooters
should not forget the words to that porno
graphic little dittv,. and that they sing it at
the 1935 basketball contests with the Stan
lord Indians. Especially, if the Stanford editor
is present.
II will be recalled that the California root
ing section did exactly that at the Big Came
last autumn.
This matter is one to be dropped immedi
ately and one that Tin: Daily hesitates to
mention again. But mere common sense and
a gentleman's liking for decency lead us to
ask the Daily Califomian to cease this silly
prattle which sooner or later is bound to urge
the Berkeley rooters to a repetition of last
November's musical orgy.
A joke is a joke. But repeated demands
tor vulgar and degrading songs in a student
newspaper is just a little bit too much.
