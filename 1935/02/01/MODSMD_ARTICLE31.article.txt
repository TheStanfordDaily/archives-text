Wo must pardon Ihe Chicago ministers who
denounce Hit' "marriage racket" in that city
as sufferers from a virulent case of sour
grapes. The ministers are sore because young
men and women can walk into the marriage
court, lay down five dollars, and walk out ten
seconds later bound in wedlock just as tight
ly as the most sonorous bishop could do the
I rick.
The ministers suggest marriage performed
to horse-and-buggy tempo with benefit of
clergy would be vastly more sanctimonious.
And anyway, they are willing to cut prices
on the job; some of them would do it dirt
chcap at two dollars.
It is difficult to see just who is to blame -
I he marriage court, or the hell-and-high-water
altitude of modern youth. One suggests the
fault might be laid at the door of the clergy
themselves, who indicate an unwillingness to
understand the impatience of young people
for all the ancient religious clap-trap and
fetish.
These young couples were bred in an era
when idol smashing was prevalent. Some of
them come from violently differing sectarian
families, and they agree that the safest way
to combine religions is to forget about them
entirely. Some of them probably wonder
what difference the scrap of paper means
any way.
The great error made by the Chicago civil
ians is the advertising of their limitations by
printing on the certificates, "joined in the
holy bonds of matrimony." They are neither
vers' holy or very binding, and the divorce
judge cares not a whoop whether priest, rabbi,
minister, or plain .Johnny Jones lied the knot,
when he gets ready to sever it.
