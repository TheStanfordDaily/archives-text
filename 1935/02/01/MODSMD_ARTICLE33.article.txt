# Swastika Over Germany

The last of a series of five.
(Our Gerin\u observer in an interview with
Rudolf Huffman, specialist on the foreign press in
the division of censors. Why do they believe in
censorship? Do German readers know less about
real facts in the news than Americans? . . . .)
Censorship is a horrid word. At the mere mention
of press censorship in Germany countless American
thousands lift eyebrows and praise the Lord they du
not live there. But is it really so bad as all that?
Herr Rudolf Hofmann, specialist on the foreign
press in the Reichspressestelle, Munich, tries in an
interview to show how his country is doing the right
thing in its censorship, and how other countries have
been (and aie) just as bad.
The Nazis are trying to create a perfectly orga
nized state, says Herr Hoftnamv. ami this alone
would be sufficient reason for holding back propa
ganda from those who are not co-operating. Gem»-
einnutz vor Eigennutz," the Common Weal above
Individual Weal, is the credo of the Nazis, and the
sooner editors realize this, says the Ministry of
Propaganda, the sooner ail bars will be lifted and
the sooner Herr Editor will be able to say what he
wishes.
If every editor would take to heart the Nazis'
credo and publish accordingly, Herr Hogmann says,
there would be no need for censorship because every
paper would be working for the same end toward
which the government is working.
The American citizen complains when his German
news is censored and feels cheated; he wants to know
all the facts. But just how close does he come to know
ing all the facts about, let us .say, elections or utility
franchises at home?
If one will ask why and how Roehm was shot,
says the German propaganda minister, and how
and why the ReichAag building took fire, why then
he might as well ask how and why Wilson died,
how and why Harding died, and why the United
States went into war! Behind every public event,
he argues, are some facts which arc not disclosed
to ail.
An American cartoon Herr Hofmann showed me
portrayed two men, one an American thug and the
other a Nazi storm trooper. The caption read, "Official
and Unofficial Gangsters." The string of unanswerable
questions about the "why" of things could be length
ened at will with that cartoon as a basis, he told me.
Why can American gangsters buy machine guns? Why
is he able- to buy automobiles, houses, judges, and
juries with his gains?
Nazis point with pride tq the minimizing of the
part money plays in their civilization. Their
"gangsters" do their shooting under supervision,
get small pay, and do their work honestly. Germans
obey orders from their superiors and gain efficiency
that way. Americans are not so careful.
Herr Hofmann had little patience with my notions
on the traditional freedom of the press, and so I gave
up the attempt to convince him. We then both laughed;
he knew I did not mean what I said about the necessity
for the freedom of the press at all times; and I realized
fully that his orders—well, they are his orders.
