### CEDRIC LARSON 
WITH THOMAS A. BAILEY
Japan appears to be greatly perturbed dver the
j resumption of agitation before the 1935 session of
Congress by American army and naval experts for
| immediate construction of the Nicaragua Canal—a
; project around which argument has raged pro and con
for a generation.
Professor Thomas A. Bailey, author of "Theodore
Roosevelt and the Japanese-American Cruses," has com--
i pleted a historical study of the proposed Nicaragyan
| Canal, and makes the following observations on this
current problem:
; "When Roosevelt 'took' Panama in 1903 and began
'to make the dirt, fly' he temporarily quieted the cen
! tury-long debate over the respective merits of the pro
( posed nineteen interoceanic canal x-outes. Even the most
j ardent proponents of a Nicaragua watei'way, from
I whom almost certain success had been snatched at the
' eleventh hour, appear to have lost hope.
"There was always the disquieting possibility, how
ever, that some European or Asiatic power might
; undertake to construct a rival waterway through Nica
| ragua. Such an enterprise would not only challenge
I Ihe Monroe Doctrine and provoke international compli-
I cations of a serious nature, but, if completed, would
l provide ruinous competition for the Panama Canal.
"In June, 1914, General Emiliano Chamorro, Nicara
i guan minister to the United States, was among ihosS
I who testified before the Senate committee on foreign
relations relative to the Nicaragua Canal. He was re
j ported to have declared that Germany was prepared
j to pay more than the $3,009,000 then being suggested
' for the canal route monopoly.
"Whatever may have been the effect of such testi-
I mony, on August 5. 1914, the Bryan-Chamorro treaty
| was signed at Washington. Specifically, the United
States was granted in perpetuity an option on the
! Nicaraguan Canal route; a ninety-nine year lease on
! the Great and Little Corn islands; and the privilege for
| a like period of establishing a naval base on the Gulf of
I Fonseca, one of the finest and most strategically located
harbors on the Pacific Coast of Latin America. In
| return for these concessions the bankrupt Nicaraguan
government was to receive $3,000,000.
"Late in 1928 a new impetus was given to the
campaign for a second canal. While stopping at
Nicaragua on his Latin American good will tour.
President-elect Hoover met President Diaz and
President-elect Moncda, both of whom made rep
t rqsentations in behalf of their route. Mr. Hoover,
j however, was noncommittal; but the incident did a
I great deal to focus attention in the United States
on a Nicaragua canal.
"From a purely financial point of view, one may
well doubt whether it will ever be advisable to build
» a Nicaragua canal. If congestion at Panama necessi
; tates an increase of interoceanic facilities—and in 1931
j the governor of the canal reported that such a step
: probably would not have to be taken until about 1970
| —a third set of locks, even larger than the present ones
! and paralleling them, may be built. This operation
would cost $140,000,000 and would add 50»000,000 tons
to the present capacity of the canal. The Nicaragua
: Waterway, on the. other hand, would cost $722,000,000
and add only 80,000,000 tons.
"The defense argument is probably the weight
iest one that can now be advanced in favor of a
second canal. In the event of a major war the naval
arm of the United States would be seriously handi
capped. if not crippled, should the fleets be unable
to join forces or pass into either ocean by means
of an isthmian waterway. There is -dways the pos
sibility that the Panama route may be blocked at a
critical moment by sabotage, aerial attacks, or even
by accidents, earthquakes, slides, and floods.
"In any event," Dr. Bailey concludes, "although
Nicaragua canal of the lock type would probably insure
: somewhat greater naval security than the present fa
cilities, it would be extremely difficult to convince the
American taxpayer, at least on the basis of any vidi nee
that has yet been forthcoming, that the additional
safety would justify the enormous expense involved.'

Japan appears to be greatly perturbed dver the

for a generation.
Professor Thomas A. Bailey, author of "Theodore

current problem:
; "When Roosevelt 'took' Panama in 1903 and began

' eleventh hour, appear to have lost hope.
"There was always the disquieting possibility, how

| —a third set of locks, even larger than the present ones
! and paralleling them, may be built. This operation
would cost $140,000,000 and would add 50»000,000 tons
to the present capacity of the canal. The Nicaragua
: Waterway, on the. other hand, would cost $722,000,000
and add only 80,000,000 tons.
"The defense argument is probably the weight
iest one that can now be advanced in favor of a
second canal. In the event of a major war the naval
arm of the United States would be seriously handi
capped. if not crippled, should the fleets be unable
to join forces or pass into either ocean by means
of an isthmian waterway. There is -dways the pos
sibility that the Panama route may be blocked at a
critical moment by sabotage, aerial attacks, or even
by accidents, earthquakes, slides, and floods.
"In any event," Dr. Bailey concludes, "although
Nicaragua canal of the lock type would probably insure
: somewhat greater naval security than the present fa
cilities, it would be extremely difficult to convince the
American taxpayer, at least on the basis of any vidi nee
that has yet been forthcoming, that the additional
safety would justify the enormous expense involved.'
