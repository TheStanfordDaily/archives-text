At the Stanford Theatre
The master showman of the ages—
the man with the heart of a child—
the creator of "the greatest show on
earth" was brought vividly to life by
Wallace Beery, who achieved a truly

great characteri
zation in his por
t r a y a 1 of Bar
num. Ado 1 p h
Menjou, as Bai
ley, the partner
in this strange
combinati on,
gave his usual

finished performance. ,
The film takes the earlie* part of
the lives of these two men, showing
the ultimate building up of their
show from the initial idea, through
the acquisition of Joyce Heth, Wash
ington's nurse, to the final addition
ot Jumbo, England's pet elephant.
And it's a!! completely human and
entertaining. Note: You'll like the
freaks.
