# CAMPUS OPINION

### 
The Editor, Sir:
I think I speak for the student body
as a whole when 1 say that most of
us are rather tired of opening out-
Dailies in the morning and finding
from one to three columns devoted
to disagreements between The Daily
and the Ex Committee or The Daily
and the .student manager. It not only
takes up newspaper space but makes
! us believe that all is not well in the
sphere of student government. It is
al>:o evident at times that this lack
of co-operation exists between the
Ex Committee and the Activities
Council and other subsidiary organ
izations.
Most of us realize that this state
1 of disharmony has been going on for
some time and so is not the fault of
any single editor or Ex Committee
but is rather inherent in the present
set-up of student government. As a
possible means of getting closer co
operation between (ho various organs
of .student government I would like
to present a plan suggested to me by
Herb Sanderson last spring; a plan
that wouJd have been embodied in
the present constitution except for
the fact that it was suggested such a
short time before the time set for J
a vote on the constitution that to in
corporate it in that document would !
have seemed to the students an at
tempt to slip something over and I
could only have meant the defeat '
of it. '
The plan is to haye an Ex Com- j
mittee composed of a president, vice
president, and .secretary of the stu- ,
dent body, elected at large, the stu- |
dent manager, the editor of The
Daily, the dramatics manager, one i
student to represent the combined ,
debating and music interests (just
who can be worked out later), the j
chairman of the Stanford Cardinals, |
the president of the Men's Council,
the president of the Women's Coun
cil, the senior student member of the j
8.A.C., the chairman of the Wom
en's Conference, and as the odd mem
ber either the yell leader or a rep
resentative from the Publications j
Council to be chosen from the Quad
or Chappie members.
This plan would, I believe, give us
j a diversified and fully informed Ex
! Committee and would allow any dif
ficulties to be ironed out in the Ex
Committee itself instead of being
thrown up to an uninformed, or at
best only partially informed, student
i body. It should give to student gov
ernment the co-operation that it at
present seems to lack. There are
more pros and cons and explanations
to be made of this scheme and if I
j may I will write another opinion later
on some of them. In the meanwhile
I hope that all students interested in
■ student government will give this
\ plan their earnest consideration.

, The Editor. Sir:
First, on behalf of the Stanford
| Band, Glee Club, and Symphony
, Orchestra, we wish to thank you for
the excellent publicity which you
gave our concert.
Second, we wish to register objec
tions to the criticism which appeared
I in this morning's issue. What proved
to be the best campus musical per
; formance in years was received by
. the critic with a minimum of musi
• cal discrimination. The concert, since
, it was publicaliy acclaimed a huge
, success, should certainly have been
played up in the columns of your
paper, as it is the forerunner of big
ger and better programs of Stanford
music groups.
Criticizing the comment point by
; point, "Finlandia." played by the
band, was not written for stringed
' instruments, and Is a standard band

number. Tschaikowsky's Finale was
certainly not grating nor harsh, and
many thought it the best number he
symphony played. The critic sugges
ted that the glee club should hav '
been placed in front of the orchestra
in the final group; we believe ihat
the public preferred to see both
organizations.
it may be of interest that Wilfred
L. Davis, the Concert Series spon
sor, extensively praised the perform••
rtnee, and is attempting to have the
full program repeated this season at
the Sun Francisco Opera Hou>~.
Yours truly,
George E. Britton, band mgr.
Art Allen, Glee Club Mgr.
Myron Birnbaum, Symphony
Orchestra Mgr.
The Editor, Sir:
The brilliant, "born-ea.st-of-tl:e-
Mississippi" Brill should explain pa
tiently to us Stanford students what
special advantages there are U> bain;s
born in the East. W;* tail to lii d a
trace of evidence in print of any
particular gifts or abilities imparted
io nam by his Eastern birth.
We, too, were not only born east
of the Mississippi, but still live there,
thus going Mr. Brill one better, so
our critical abilities are presumably
intact, if one is to follow the gentle
man's. And we find that the critical
abilities of the said Mr. Brill have
| suffered considerably from degenera
ting contacts with western collegiate
minds.
I We are aware that New York als.i
! has several night clubs.

| Considering the enthusiastic ap
plause of the audience, I am inclined
;to believe that your music critic
I stands alone on her opinions of Wed-
J nesday evening's concert.

LAUDS FAIRMINDEDNESS
The Editor, Sir:
May I congratulate you on the ex -
cellent article appearing in the Daily
entitled "Swastika Over Germany.''
Especially good was the first which
explained the philosophy of the Ger
man people in regard to Hitler's dic
tatorship. An orchid to the Daily for
fair-mindedness!
