# BULL SESSION
## TO A FLY IN A JAR OF LIQUID SOAP 
### 
In the Stanford Library, in a
washroom, in the right hand jar of
liquid soap, lies a fly. Just a com
mon house Hy (Musca domestica).
How it got there probably no one
knows. Whether it was the imper
tinent curiosity that spurs flies on
to do such contemptible things; or
whether it was an irrepressible urga
o redeem a race of insects known
only for dirtiness; or whether it was
someone's idea of a good joke—is a
matter of small moment. But the fly
has lain thex-e for more than a week
— thoroughly drowned, thoroughly
cleansed.
While this fly has slumbered there,
it has missed out on a whole series
of momentous morsels reserved only
for we who are not drowned in a
jar of liquid soap:
The fly has missed Siaida, the
psycho-palmist, Siaida, who writes
for the free press of San Francisco,
will tell you whether you are des
tined for love, murder, or success —
by the grooves in your palm, and
the twists in your knuckles. If you
have a forefinger that is somewhat
hooked from habitually gripping the
trigger of a gun—you are the crim
ihal type. If your "life line" is long,
and your name is Grace Moore —you
are headed for success. If you will
send ten cents to Siaida, you can
stop struggling, and rest on your
palms.
The fly has missed the Martin
Johnsons, who are at it again. To a
public fed on funny papers, Mickey
Mouse, "Chu Chin Chow," and
"Goona-Goona," the Martin John
sons are now ready to offer "Baboo
na."
The fly has missed Bruno Haupt
mann, who speaks English only less
poorly than his reporters write it.
The fly has missed the defeat of
the World Court, and the spectacle
of a United States Senate led by its
patriotic nose into a red, white, and
blue hermitage.
The fly has missed Dr. Townsend,
who says that Americans can only
become rich by becoming senile.
The fly has missed Huey Long,
who says that Americans can only
become happy by becoming insane.
All these, and more, the fly in the
jar of liquid soap in the washroom
in the Stanford Library has missed.
Move over, fly.
—Dave Mellinkoff.
P.S. As this is written, orders have
just been issued for the fly's re-1
moval.
