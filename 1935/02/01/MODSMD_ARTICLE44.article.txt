# Fancy Names for Daily Debated in Early Days

### BARBARA SWEET 
How would you like to have The
Palm Tree Daily left on your door
step every morning? Or would you
prefer, The Stanford Cloister (Roble
ites give heed!), or more aristocrati
cally, The Stanford Intelligence?
These were some of the names sug
gested when, in 1912, it was first pro
posed that the name of the Stanford
student newspaper be changed from
The Daily Palo Alto to something
more characteristic of the university.
Lost Significance
"As the town has grown up since
the college daily was established,"
reads an editorial in the special
birthday edition of the paper pub
lished September 20, 1912," "the
name 'Palo Alto' belongs to the town
and its paper, not to the University
daily."
Archie Rice, '95, associate editor
of the first volume of The Daily,
which appealed the day Stanford
opened its doors in 1891, reviewed the
derivation of the names of Stanford
publications in the same issue, and
gave as a defense against the charge
of a ruthless desire to alter tradition
the fact that he was the original ad
vocate of the name, The Daily Palo
Alto.
Rice specified, as the requisite for
a good name for a newspaper, that
it be distinctive, significant, charac
teristic, euphoneous, intelligible,
unique if possible, and not lop
sided." He recommended the name
"The Stanford Sundown, as the Daily
was an evening newspaper at that
time.
Action Delayed
A prize of $10 was offered for the
best name, but it seems that no action
was taken on the matter, for the
paper continued to be published
under the name The Daily Palo Alto
for the 14 succeeding years.
In 1926 the paper was changed

from an evening to a morning paper
! end at the same time the name was
changed to The Stanford Daily as it
I reads today. Because of the change,
the A.S.S.U. Executive Committee
i voted to increase the sum of money
I allotted the paper from 50c to 75c
per student.
The nickname "Dippy," which is
! sometimes used to designate The
Daily, originated from the name The
Daily Palo Alto. Slurring together
! the first three letters D.P.A., cam
pus wags created the more euphon
ious term "Dippy." With the change
of name the term became obsolete
j and is no longer in good usage.

How would you like to have The
Palm Tree Daily left on your door
step every morning? Or would you
prefer, The Stanford Cloister (Roble
ites give heed!), or more aristocrati
cally, The Stanford Intelligence?
These were some of the names sug
gested when, in 1912, it was first pro
posed that the name of the Stanford
student newspaper be changed from
The Daily Palo Alto to something
more characteristic of the university.
Lost Significance
"As the town has grown up since
the college daily was established,"
reads an editorial in the special
birthday edition of the paper pub
lished September 20, 1912," "the
name 'Palo Alto' belongs to the town
and its paper, not to the University
daily."
Archie Rice, '95, associate editor
of the first volume of The Daily,
which appealed the day Stanford
opened its doors in 1891, reviewed the
derivation of the names of Stanford
publications in the same issue, and
gave as a defense against the charge
of a ruthless desire to alter tradition
the fact that he was the original ad
vocate of the name, The Daily Palo
Alto.
Rice specified, as the requisite for
a good name for a newspaper, that
it be distinctive, significant, charac
teristic, euphoneous, intelligible,
unique if possible, and not lop
sided." He recommended the name
"The Stanford Sundown, as the Daily
was an evening newspaper at that
time.
Action Delayed
A prize of $10 was offered for the
best name, but it seems that no action
was taken on the matter, for the
paper continued to be published
under the name The Daily Palo Alto
for the 14 succeeding years.
In 1926 the paper was changed

from an evening to a morning paper
! end at the same time the name was
changed to The Stanford Daily as it
I reads today. Because of the change,
the A.S.S.U. Executive Committee
i voted to increase the sum of money
I allotted the paper from 50c to 75c
per student.
The nickname "Dippy," which is
! sometimes used to designate The
Daily, originated from the name The
Daily Palo Alto. Slurring together
! the first three letters D.P.A., cam
pus wags created the more euphon
ious term "Dippy." With the change
of name the term became obsolete
