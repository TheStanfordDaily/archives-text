# Odds Favor Bears In Tilt With Cards Tonight
## EVERY CAL GAME SINCE 1925 LOST ON FARM COURTS Coach Bunn to Start Quade, Bost, Turner, Moore and Lindsey 
### Phil Dully 
Facing the grim fact that a Stan
ford basketball team has not de
feated California in the Pavilion
since 1925, a determined Cardinal
quintet will go on the floor tonight
at 7:30 o'clock once again on the
short end of odds favoring the Golden
Bear.
During that long drought on the
courts the Farm teams have won a
Big Game here and there, but
always on the California floors. In
those now distant clays there was
a superstition following the Pa
vilion with its glass backboards
and poor lighting, that all hoop
games played there ended in small
scores.
This jinx held true on the night
of February 21, 1925, when with Cal
ifornia leading 15-14 and one minute
to go, Fred Price looped in a long
shot to give the Cardinals- a 16-15
victory, their last over the Bears in
the Pavilion.
Beaten Three Times
Strange as it may seern to present
basketball followers, this game
marked the third successive year that
Stanford had beaten California in
the Pavilion. In February of 1923
Andy Kerr's men won over Cal 18-17,
and the following year repeated the
performance with the small score.
In that day of basketball one man
could shoot all the free throws and
Stanford had Captain Nip McHose
who seldom missed his many chances.
In 1923 and 1924 it was his ability to
sink free shots that provided that
one point margin which spelled vic
tory for Stanford.
Tall Stars in '23
During the 1923 game, however,
Johnnie Talt of California challenged
McHose's right to free throw su
premacy by sinking 11 out of 13 tries.
The Bears took an early lead and
were on the long end of a 12-6
score at the half.
In the second period Cal's only
points came from Talt's five foul
shots. The Indians, with the help of
eight free throws by McHose, climb
ed to the top and won the game.
Out To End Jinx
With that history to help them the
1935 Stanford varsity goes out to
night in an effort to break a long
string of California victories in the
Pavilion. Coach John Bunn has won
but two games in his encounters with
the Berkeleyites.
One was the victory last year and
the other was his first meeting with
the Blue and Gold in 1931 when the
Stanfords emerged victors 37-32 in
an overtime game. Tonight Bunn
feels he has an even chance to win.
Looking forward optimistically he
said: "The general sentiment around
is that our ball team is all shot, and
I don t think that at all. Simply be
cause we lost one game to Cal is
no reason we can't win one."'
Bunn will start Rod Bost and
Bill Quade at forwards, Howell
Turner at center, and Dinty Moore
and Robin Lmdsey at guards.
Moore will be acting captain.
Keith Topping, whose infected
hand is healing rapidly, will prob
ably see action, as will Carl Schott,
who has been showing up well in
practice.

no reason we can't win one."'
Bunn will start Rod Bost and
Bill Quade at forwards, Howell
Turner at center, and Dinty Moore
and Robin Lmdsey at guards.
Moore will be acting captain.
Keith Topping, whose infected
hand is healing rapidly, will prob
ably see action, as will Carl Schott,
who has been showing up well in
practice.
Facing the grim fact that a Stan
ford basketball team has not de
feated California in the Pavilion
since 1925, a determined Cardinal
quintet will go on the floor tonight
at 7:30 o'clock once again on the
short end of odds favoring the Golden
Bear.
During that long drought on the
courts the Farm teams have won a
Big Game here and there, but
always on the California floors. In
those now distant clays there was
a superstition following the Pa
vilion with its glass backboards
and poor lighting, that all hoop
games played there ended in small
scores.
This jinx held true on the night
of February 21, 1925, when with Cal
ifornia leading 15-14 and one minute
to go, Fred Price looped in a long
shot to give the Cardinals- a 16-15
victory, their last over the Bears in
the Pavilion.
Beaten Three Times
Strange as it may seern to present
basketball followers, this game
marked the third successive year that
Stanford had beaten California in
the Pavilion. In February of 1923
Andy Kerr's men won over Cal 18-17,
and the following year repeated the
performance with the small score.
In that day of basketball one man
could shoot all the free throws and
Stanford had Captain Nip McHose
who seldom missed his many chances.
In 1923 and 1924 it was his ability to
sink free shots that provided that
one point margin which spelled vic
tory for Stanford.
Tall Stars in '23
During the 1923 game, however,
Johnnie Talt of California challenged
McHose's right to free throw su
premacy by sinking 11 out of 13 tries.
The Bears took an early lead and
were on the long end of a 12-6
score at the half.
In the second period Cal's only
points came from Talt's five foul
shots. The Indians, with the help of
eight free throws by McHose, climb
ed to the top and won the game.
Out To End Jinx
With that history to help them the
1935 Stanford varsity goes out to
night in an effort to break a long
string of California victories in the
Pavilion. Coach John Bunn has won
but two games in his encounters with
the Berkeleyites.
One was the victory last year and
the other was his first meeting with
the Blue and Gold in 1931 when the
Stanfords emerged victors 37-32 in
an overtime game. Tonight Bunn
feels he has an even chance to win.
Looking forward optimistically he
said: "The general sentiment around
is that our ball team is all shot, and
I don t think that at all. Simply be
cause we lost one game to Cal is
no reason we can't win one."'
