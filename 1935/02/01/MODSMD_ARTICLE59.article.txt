## 
### 
Local poloists will swing into ac
tion this afternoon, in preparations
for a busy season, with a regular j
| inter-squad practice game. The con- j
test, in which two Red outfits will
1 alternate against two Whites, will be
played on the Highway Field begin- '
j ning at 2 o'clock, according to Lieut. ;
Haydon Y. Grubbs, polo coach.
Last quarter some first-class polo !
j was displayed in these weekly train
ing scrimmages. There is plenty of j
' parking space available for specta- ,
tors around the field.
An impressive tentative schedule j
| for the remainder of the season, j
which is being arranged by Lieut, i
j Grubbs, includes a two-game series ;
with San Mateo Polo Club, Univer- j
sity of California, University of
j Southern California, Oregon State j
j College, San Mateo Junior College, J
; Utah, and the University of Arizona. |
j Dates for these series have not been
I arranged as yet.
The first string will probably line j
up today with Captain Bill Rogers,
j Russ Rasmussen, Bob Fullerton, and |
I either Jim Henderson or Bill Ene- !
I mark.
I The team's chances suffered a set- j
back this quarter with news that
Carl Beal, one of the most promis- j
ing candidates for Luppe Luppen's
vacated position, had sustained a
broken leg over the holidays which I
will keep him out of the line-up for !
some time.
