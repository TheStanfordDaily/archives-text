# HALF DOZEN QUINTETS FACE INTRAMURAL FIELD
## 
### 
The intramural basketball race this
' season has been featured particularly
by the wide divergence in the play of
j some half dozen or more teams over
' the rest of the field, and the conse
| quent high scores which games have
j produced.
As the boxing championships
I forced a lull in basketball activity
last night the standings placed the
j Business School as a certain con
i tender for the title, with Theta Chi,
: El Campo, Breakers, Zeta Psi, Inde
| pendent 1, Sequoia 1, and one or two
1 others right up in the first class,
j Phi Psi by scoring 94 points in a
j game last week s'et what is probably
i an all time intramural record. But
j the class of competition may be
judged by the fact that the Phi Psi

J has been beaten by Theta Chi, and
won but a close victory over Sequoia
: 2 after trailing the early part of the
' game.
Evidence that a team's condition
on a particular night is the all im
! portant factor was showed in the
recent El Campo-Delta Tau Delta
game. Both had defeated Theta Delta
Chi with scores of 66; but when the
two winners met Campo had no
trouble in walking away with the
contest, 33 to 18.
A great majority of the 45 teams
seeking the University championshin
have exhibited flashes of excellent
: play. While the standouts have
| showed consistently good fundamen -
tals, and hard play geared down to
, a speed that is maintained through
: the 40-minute contests.
