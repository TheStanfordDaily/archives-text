# VARSITY RUGGERS CLASH TOMORROW WITH U.S.F. DONS
## "B's" Meet Don Seconds; Game Slated for 2:15 On Home Field 
### Warren Breed 
The "A" team ruggsrites ran
through the "B's" yesterday in prac
tice, and will take it easy today in
preparation for their first intercol
legiate game tomorrow with the
U.S.F. Dons on the Stanford field.
The B's will take on the Don sec
onds, starting at 2:15 o'clock. The
varsity game will begin an hour later.
Lineups are still uncertain. Ray
Lewis was playing full last night,
and Frank Alustiza, Johnny Reis
ner, and Fred Abbott were not able
to take part in the scrimmage, so
the backfield line is more of a
puz/le than it ever vv;«.
Alustiza's presence is somewhat of
a doubt at all times, due to his Enema
store, but the coaching staff is well
satisfied with the work of Bob Mon
davi at the fullback position. This
chunky fellow knows the game, and
is a dependable "safety" man.
The chief Card strength "lies in
five fast backfield men. Reisner, Jim
Trompas, Ray Lewis, Tony Cockins,
and Joe Vigna are all dangerous ball
toters, and with this threat there is
no great need for any other kind of
a defense or offense. They are all
learning how to pass the ball back
to the next man, which is one of the
rugger fundamentals.
Trompas, especially, is a surprise
to the team. He gets started faster
than any other back, and is shifty
as well. Cock ins, the scrum half,
is one of the most active of the fif
teen, and is responsible for much
of the marches down the field.
The two coaches, Harry Maloney
and Jim Wylie, were being helped
yesterday by Snowey Angell, ex-
Stanford athlete and now one of the
league referees.
