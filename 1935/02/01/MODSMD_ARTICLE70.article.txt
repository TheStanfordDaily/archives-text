# BRADSHAW BACKS FROSH FOR HEAVY WIN OVER BEARS
## High Scoring Papoose Five Should Win—Coach; Lineup Intact 
### 
"Stanford froth should win from
Calilornia by a comi'ortable score."
These were Cardinal Coach Jimmie
Biidshr.w's words last night als he
expre. c c cl :onf.d( nee in his unbeaten
team of i icshmt n basketball players
who meet .he California yearlings
in the fi >:l of their annual Little
Bit; Gf'rr. s ;:t (J. 30 o'clock tonight in
the PaviPon preliminary to the
Stanlord-Cali'oinia varsity tussle.
Bradshaw's certitude in his men
is well founded, In nine games
this year the fresh have emerged
victorious each time and last
week-end succecded in taking two
70-point wins from th»'ir oppo
nents. Comparing scores with the
Bear fiosh quintet. Stanford is
rated 43 points better.
California has shown poorly all
season, and Tuesday night at the
hands of San Mateo J.C. the Bear
Cubs collected another defeat. Coach
Bill Higgins has spent the week
shifting his men endeavoring to find
a scoring combination. His "grape
vine" offense, although slow, is ex
pected to cause the local team con
siderable trouble.
Yesterday the Stanford frosh
wound up their week's training with
a short scrimmage session topped off
with lrce throw practice. Today no '
workout is scheduled.
Starting Line-up Follows
The Stanford frosh starting line
up for tonight will be as follows:
Hank Luisctti, captain and forward,
elected -City'" lorward three con- j
secutive years while playing for Gal- j
ileo High School. He stands 6 feet j
2 inches, weighs 175 pounds and spe- j
cializes in quick passing and shoot- j
ing but seldom dribbles. Remark- |
ably adept at one-hand shots, he has '
an average of 19 points made per j
game this season.
Clarence Maurer. forward —Start- j
ed the season second-string but 1
proved his ability in the Paly High
game. Has been playing first-string I
for the past month and he and Lui- j
setti present an unbeatable forward j
combination. Hails from Pennsyl- J
vania and was elected "all-State" j
forward there in 11)32. Maurer is 5
feet il inches tall, weighs IGO pounds.
Zonne Tallest Man
Bob Zonne. center — Tallest man
on the team, Zonne stands 6 feet
4 inches and tips the scales at 175.
Specializes in shooting from the cor
ners but was unable to make these
tries good last week. Is best on re
covering rebounds because of his
height. Zonne was "all-City" center
last year at Los Angeles High School.
H. B. Lee. guard—Although only 5
feet 10 inches, Lee is considered one
of the sti ongest guards seen at Stan
ford in some time. He is a clever
floor man, seldom shoots, but has
been able to make his basket tries
good when attempted. Lee played
last year for Hollywood High.
Nelly Ileatli, guard — Heath, first- j
string frosh football center, is the j
heaviest man on the team, weighing
180. His best points are recovering
rebounds, long passes, and distance
shots. Heath's weight and size come
in to good advantage, as his guard
job requires a rough and tumble
style of play under the basket.
"Stanford froth should win from
Calilornia by a comi'ortable score."

the PaviPon preliminary to the
Stanlord-Cali'oinia varsity tussle.
Bradshaw's certitude in his men
is well founded, In nine games
this year the fresh have emerged
victorious each time and last
week-end succecded in taking two
70-point wins from th»'ir oppo
nents. Comparing scores with the
Bear fiosh quintet. Stanford is
rated 43 points better.
California has shown poorly all
season, and Tuesday night at the
hands of San Mateo J.C. the Bear
Cubs collected another defeat. Coach
Bill Higgins has spent the week
shifting his men endeavoring to find
a scoring combination. His "grape
vine" offense, although slow, is ex
pected to cause the local team con
siderable trouble.
Yesterday the Stanford frosh
wound up their week's training with
a short scrimmage session topped off
with lrce throw practice. Today no '
workout is scheduled.
Starting Line-up Follows
The Stanford frosh starting line
up for tonight will be as follows:
Hank Luisctti, captain and forward,
elected -City'" lorward three con- j
secutive years while playing for Gal- j
ileo High School. He stands 6 feet j
2 inches, weighs 175 pounds and spe- j
cializes in quick passing and shoot- j
ing but seldom dribbles. Remark- |
ably adept at one-hand shots, he has '
an average of 19 points made per j
game this season.
Clarence Maurer. forward —Start- j
ed the season second-string but 1
proved his ability in the Paly High
game. Has been playing first-string I
for the past month and he and Lui- j
setti present an unbeatable forward j
combination. Hails from Pennsyl- J
vania and was elected "all-State" j
forward there in 11)32. Maurer is 5
feet il inches tall, weighs IGO pounds.
Zonne Tallest Man
Bob Zonne. center — Tallest man
on the team, Zonne stands 6 feet
4 inches and tips the scales at 175.
Specializes in shooting from the cor
ners but was unable to make these
tries good last week. Is best on re
covering rebounds because of his
height. Zonne was "all-City" center
last year at Los Angeles High School.
H. B. Lee. guard—Although only 5
feet 10 inches, Lee is considered one
of the sti ongest guards seen at Stan
ford in some time. He is a clever
floor man, seldom shoots, but has
been able to make his basket tries
good when attempted. Lee played
last year for Hollywood High.
Nelly Ileatli, guard — Heath, first- j
string frosh football center, is the j
heaviest man on the team, weighing
180. His best points are recovering
rebounds, long passes, and distance
shots. Heath's weight and size come
in to good advantage, as his guard
job requires a rough and tumble
style of play under the basket.
"Stanford froth should win from
Calilornia by a comi'ortable score."
These were Cardinal Coach Jimmie
Biidshr.w's words last night als he
expre. c c cl :onf.d( nee in his unbeaten
team of i icshmt n basketball players
