# Wes Muller's Horsepower Rivals Horses
## 
### 
A horse is seldom able to do one
horsepower of work at any one time,
but experiment has definitely estab
lished the fact that Wes Muller. first
string center of the Stanford Varsity
football team, is capable of creating
.37 horsepower.
Muller, acting as a subject for ex
perimentation in Mechanics 31,
mounted a table in front of the class
of skeptical engineers. He grabbed
the crank of the horsepower testing
machine and started turning the
wheel at a horse-killing rate. The
wheel, under a resistance of 28
pouncts, spun swiftly around at a rate
of .45 seconds per revolution and the
experiment was over.
With wild slide rule calculations,
and applications of various mechan
ics formulas, the result was finally
derived, giving Muller the awe-in
spiring total of .37 horsepower.
