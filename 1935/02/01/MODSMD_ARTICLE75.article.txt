# FATE OF FROSH-VARSITY TRACK MEET DEPENDENT ON NUMBER TURNING OUT
## 
### MORT D'EVELYN 
Dink Templcton has scheduled an
inter-squad meet for his 1935 varsity
and Bill Ellington's frosh tracks!ers
on Angell Field this afternoon pro
viding that "someone turns out."
Last Friday intramural basketball
and the like reduced the squad to
the extent that several events had to
l be omitted because of lack of compe
tition.
If Ilay Dean, Chuck Voight, and
Jimmy Kncubuhl report, the
sprints should provide interesting
competition. Voight ran all by
himself in the 100-yard dash last
Friday, breaking the tape in 10.1
| seconds. All three appear to be
j still way out of condition, but at
1 least one of the three should run
10 flat.
Captain Gus Meier of last year's
varsity has been coaching the hurd
-1 lers during the past two weeks,
1 spending considerable time on Cy
Oberg and Ken Peters, Hunt and

| Ralph Kingsbury of the Fro-h. <>nd
Charles Johnson, a transfer. S: in
Klopstock. IC4A and NC2A champ
of last year, may be conceded first
place, but the other places should be
hotly contested by the five previous
; ly mentioned men.
I Other contested events should be
Chuck Nimmo-Warren Dixon mile,
Dave Devlin-Rusty March two-mile,
and the discus, with Phil Levy, Hcr
j man King, and frosh Stanley Marks.
Niagara Falls is 95.17 per cent
Canadian.
