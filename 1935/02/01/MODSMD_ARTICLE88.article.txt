# Bruno's Story Confirmed By Alibi Witness
## First Handwriting Experts Called by Defense 
### 
FLEMINGTGN, N.J.. Jrn. 31 </P).â€”
j The story of a mysterious station
j wagon that carried two men and a
I ladder toward the scene of Baby
j Lindbergh's kidnap-murder and the
hotly disputed testimony of a hand
i writing witness were linked today
! with Bruno Richard Hauptmann's
j alibi defense.
j Just before the celebrated murder
t trial reached the end of its 22nd
I dramatic day, the carpenter's coun
] sel won the right to put the first
| handwriting expert on the witness
j stand to attack the state's identifica
| tion of Hauptmann as the ransom
j writer.
Alibi Strengthened
Two new alibi witnesses, a Hun
garian batik artist and a Harlem
restaurant owner, bolstered the ac
cused man's story of what he did
on the night the golden-haired baby
; was stolen and slain.
I Hauptmann's tale of that wild first
I night of March, 1932, was this:
That he was in the Bronx, 60 miles
I from the lonely Hopewell home of
! Colonel and Mrs. Charles A. Lind
bergh; that he called for his wife at
the bakery where she worked; took
the baker's dog for a walk and then
went home with Mrs. Hauptmann.
Stories Attacked
The state, led by fiery Attorney
General David T. Wilentz, ripped
into each story savagely.
Much of Wilentz' fire was directed
at the credibility and record of Lou
Harding, young laborer in a tattered
lumber jacket, who swore that two
men in a station wagon, loaded with
a ladder, asked him directions to the
Lindbergh estate on the afternoon of
the kidnaping.
Neither of the men was Haupt
mann and the ladder appeared to
be "one of them slide ladders" like
the one used in the kidnaping, said
Harding, who was working on a
Princeton roadside at the time.
