MAKING NEWSREELS
The newsreel cameraman, Morris
Markey, a famous reporter, earns i
about a hundred dollars a week for
handling a 60-pound machine worth
$6,000 and as delicate as a watch, and
for being a "combination of exper'
crrftsman, pack horse, Nosey Parker,
and Buttling Nelson."
Speed counts for everything, and
the steady stream of film pouring
into New York from the 'camera
magazines must be developed, edited, i
printed up, and shipped out imme- .
diately. Most of the cutting is done
at night by editors who live for years
"on the sandwiches and coffee banned
down in front of them by the studio ;
kitchen."
Fox is the only newsreel outfit
with a genuine world-wide group of |
picture gatherers, in New York, Syd
ney, Paris, Tokio, Prague, and many \
other cities. Pathe, Paramount,!
Hearst Metrotone News, and Uni
versal are the others, but they can- •

not match Fox's hundred cameramen
abroad in the world.
The cameraman is a counterpart
of the born newspaperman of other
days. They must be "a rugged lot,
very strong physically, with the gall
of a brass monkey intrepid and foot
loose, arid fanatically in love with
their jobo."
