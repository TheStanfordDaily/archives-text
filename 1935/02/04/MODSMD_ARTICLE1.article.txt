iod to wiiT over the strong Santa

Many Fouls Called
Both games were somewhat of a
lough and tumble affair with the
Bear 郊많ame taking honors with 39
personal fouls being called, and 27
checked in the Bronco fiay. Attempts
of the officials to equalize the fouls
resulted in some inconsistent offi
ciating, especially in the Cal game.
Stanford started the scoring in the
Santa Clara game when Rod Bost
dropped in a free throw. The Broncos
were quick to retaliate and jumped
into a six-point lead, due to some
tricky and fast passing that brought
gasps from the spectators.
Broncos Lead at Half
With the score at 7-1 for the Mis
sion men, Bost and Howell Turner
opened up and brought the count to
7-7. Otten added two for Santa Clara,
and Keith Topping again tied the

Turner brought the count to 11-9 for
the Cards, and from there on the
Broncos took the lead.
At the start of the second half
Goodell ran the visitors total to 19.
From then on Stanford boomed. Two
perfect buckets by Robin Lindsey,
one by Turner, and one by Dinty
Moore brought the tally to 19-19.
Not content the Cards kept going
and Moore, Bost and Topping
brought the count to 25 before Ban
non scored for the Broncos, giving

more; Eckman added two for the

In five minutes they led 2G-20. An
other rough five minutes found them
ahead 29-24. With ten minutes left
Rod Bost made the last tally for the
