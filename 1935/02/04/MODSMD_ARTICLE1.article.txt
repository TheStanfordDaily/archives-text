Trailing Jl-17 at half-time Stan
ford's red-shirted basketball team
came from behind in the second per
iod to wiiT over the strong Santa

of lhe Indians, a decided contrast to
the previous night when the Farm
team dropped another game to the
"bombers" from Berkeley 37-31.
Many Fouls Called
Both games were somewhat of a
lough and tumble affair with the
Bear ■game taking honors with 39
personal fouls being called, and 27
checked in the Bronco fiay. Attempts
of the officials to equalize the fouls
resulted in some inconsistent offi
ciating, especially in the Cal game.
Stanford started the scoring in the
Santa Clara game when Rod Bost
dropped in a free throw. The Broncos
were quick to retaliate and jumped
into a six-point lead, due to some
tricky and fast passing that brought
gasps from the spectators.
Broncos Lead at Half
With the score at 7-1 for the Mis
sion men, Bost and Howell Turner
opened up and brought the count to
7-7. Otten added two for Santa Clara,
and Keith Topping again tied the
score. With seven minutes to go
Turner brought the count to 11-9 for
the Cards, and from there on the
Broncos took the lead.
At the start of the second half
Goodell ran the visitors total to 19.
From then on Stanford boomed. Two
perfect buckets by Robin Lindsey,
one by Turner, and one by Dinty
Moore brought the tally to 19-19.
Not content the Cards kept going
and Moore, Bost and Topping
brought the count to 25 before Ban
non scored for the Broncos, giving
them 21.
Overtaken by Cal

more; Eckman added two for the
visitors; Topping added four more,
and Bost one. With a minute to go
the score stood 33-26 for the Cards.

Santa Clara points.

"bouts" Friday night the better. At

dians looked like the winning team.
In five minutes they led 2G-20. An
other rough five minutes found them
ahead 29-24. With ten minutes left
Rod Bost made the last tally for the
Cards, by picking up a loose ball and '
outrunning everyone to make a per
fect and difficult shot.
