# Air Alliance Strong
## 
### 
| In the field of aviation the new
! accord was regarded as the most
I binding alliance undertaken between
! nations since the World War, with
j the possible exception of secret pacts.
It literally does not allow for a
{single minute's consideration in the
| event of aggression, much less a
| consultation of the Le;igue of Na-
I tions council as provided in the Lo
! carno treaty.
It added, however, that Italy, Ger
many, and Belgium were invited to
j join the alliance as-equal partners.
