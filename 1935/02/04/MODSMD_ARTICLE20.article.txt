# High Court Again Delays Decision on Gold Clause
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 3 (/P). â€”
Washington resigned itself today to
more waiting for the Supreme
Court's gold decision and looked for
ward, without enthusiasm, to a con
tinuation of that subject as an ir
repressible topic of speculation.
The capital, in fact, felt let down.
Even Administration officials, dis
closing their preparations for the
veidict were complete, expressed
disappointment at; the court's an
nouncement that the opinion would
not be handed down tomorrow.
