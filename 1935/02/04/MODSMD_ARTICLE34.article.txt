# Basketball, and Other Things

### 
II wasn't prellv Oscar, and ncilhcr was il
basketball! We refer to that unwarranted
galloping, sliding, skidding, rolling, pitching,
staggering exhibition ol' the art of rough and
tumble staged, in the guise ol' the cage game,
by Stanford and California in Encina Phvilion
Friday night.
Nibs Price brought his gang over from
across the bay, and Stanford's coach John
IJunn, evidently feeling that you must* light
lire with fire, let the Indians match the visitors
play for play. On lop of that, the officials
seemed struck with an uncommonly severe at
lack of stage fright, and spent the evening
stumbling about the court, sometimes in and
sometimes out of the players' way, in an ap
parently futile effort to see just what was
going on.
Maybe the spectators enjoyed it; but it is
doubtful if they did. It is one thing to go to
a basketball game and see one; and another
tiling to go, expecting to see basketball, and
find the evening full of legs and arms sticking
up in all sorts of grotesque positions, with a
herd of baby beeves rolling about like madmen
while the referee casts his leer over the whole
scene.
The reputation of rough and crude play fol
lows some athletic teams wherever they go;
Saturday night California and St. Mary's were
attentive to the niceties of fine sportsmanship
but indulged themselves in a slugging match
between players that almost added a general
riot of the spectators as the finishing touch.
In two weeks Stanford will again be hosts
lo this superlative wrestling squad from Ber
keley. It ought to be a close contest, boys, so
bring your brass knucks and bludgeons and
make it a perfect evening.
