rather Coughlin is not a new story in the
Kasl, where he is a regular feature on the air
waves over which he has gathered a following
of millions. Until recently, however, the Paci
fic Coast had remained blissfully unaware,
relatively speaking, of the "radio priest's"
existence.
Rut that stale of a Hairs ended abruptly the
other day when readers of the Hearst news
papers had served up to them on page I of
millions of papers Father Coughlin's nauseat
ing distortion of the Scriptures in an effort to
defeat the World Court proposition.
Regardless of what one thinks of the World
Court, no intelligent person can hesitate to
condemn such demagogic, sensational appeals
to religious emotion. A question of such grave
political and international importance should
be settled by thoughtful deliberations, not by
hysterical shouting from the house tops.
That is the way of the demagogue, however,
and that is why such men are a grave danger
in a democratic society. When the electorate
ceases to think and begins to follow a har

way out.
