### 
That bulwark of campus service, the estab
lishment familiarly known as the Cellar,
comes to public notice once again.
The I'nion, it seems, is making money. This
is so even today, when students can purchase
a cup of coll'ee for f>c, the same :is any other
place. Orice upon n time the same cup of codec
was worth 10c.
Hut the Union, holding a monopoly of cam
pus business, makes a profit today and charges
the lonely student some very interesting
prices.
.lust one example for the present — a 5c
bottle of orange juice, in a glass, enriches the
I'nion coll'erji by some 20c.
Is that .Justice?
