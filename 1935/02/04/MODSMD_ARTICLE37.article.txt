Washington from the sidelines—with Reid R.
Briggs, former associate editor of The Stanford
Daily, comes to these columns periodically com
mencing this morning. Briggs is now on Capitol
Hill in the Senate building and is close to the pulse
of the nation's activities.
Capitol Hill,
Washington, D. C.
February 2, 1935
Editor, The Daily:
Members of the House of Representatives are still
chuckling over the set-to of a couple of the new legis
lators who arrived here for the new Congress. They
are both young and were pretty impressed with their
own importance.
It happened at a cocktail party, given by one of
Washington's minor but aspiring hostesses. The two
members arrived separately, and dignified introductions
were being made all around, when the two came to
gether. Each was introduced to the other as Congress
man Soandso; one had a fairly funny name, and that
didn't help any.
Each of them thought the other bird was no M. C.
at all, but was trying to kid him with the aid of the
hostess. They both drew up to their full psychological
heights, and nearly came to blows when each felt the
other was carrying the joke too far. They shrivelled
when they caught on, and the party was a huge success.
One of 'em, by the way, is from California.
Doc Townsend's old age pension bill (a revolving
pension, the Doc calls it) has been gently revolving in
the House Committee on Ways and Means, where it
was shunted after California's poet laureate, Represen
tative John Steven McGroarty, introduced it January
16. The bill is a curious jumble, and was apparently
drawn up without the assistance of the House legisla
tive counsel, whose job it is to iron out kinks at the
request of any member who has a bill he wants trimmed
up. McGroarty and Townsend prefer the rough dry, I
guess.
The $200 a month that all the yelling is about by this
bill is made payable at any bank belonging to the
Federal Deposit Insurance system. The pensioner just
goes around at the first of the month and collects it.
(F. R. wants to hold it to $15.)
There is one large, amazing loophole in the bill, as it
is now worded. As far as I can see, any qualified pen
sioner could collect $200 a month from as many feder
ally insured banks as he could hustle around to on the
first of the month. In Palo Alto, that would be $600 a
month, a tidy sum. Spry old fellers could dash to Menlo
and Mayfield for an extra $200 or so. •
The net result, I suppose, would sooner or later be
a concentration of oldsters in the big cities, where they
could make an easy circuit of all the many banks on pay
day. What a payoff' that would be!
More anon.
Yours,
Reid R. Briggs, '32
