Pacific coast longshoremen, seamen and their em
ployers today are fence sitters. They sit together in
peace atop agreement fence where they climbed last
August after the bloodiest and most expensive labor
revolt ever staged on the coast.
As long as inertia is maintained all will be well.
But the fence is rickety. It often topples. The position
of the sitters is precarious. If the balance of satisfaction
between the sitters is upset and the fence topples to
the left (if either of the two factions starts trouble
with a lockout or a walkout, then there will be a repe
tition of June, July, August, 1934. But if dissatisfaction
causes the fence to fall to the right, then there will be
peaceful settlement and all concerned will mount the
agreement fnce for another sit.
Either of these two movements are possible and
even imminent. This series will attempt to justify
this assumption presenting a complete and accurate
picture of maritime labor conditions, p*\st and pres
ent. based on a study of facts brought to the fore
by strikes of the past summer.
Strikes, contrary to common belief, are not incidents
brought about by specific and immediate causes, un
related to the other phases and stages of labor move
ments. Such an erroneous view comes from lack of
perspective and understanding of the real causes. An
observer who sees a strike from a superficial point of
view overemphasizes the dramatic, the sensational.
He sees wild-eyed, violent "Reds" leading simple work
men; bloodshed, and brutality as the inevitable result.
Strikes often do involve radicals and bloodshed, but
these phases are only incidental to the real issues.
True, it is sometimes justifiable to bewail the use of
militia or of "direct action" by the strikers, but such
bewailing is apt to distort the whole picture sc that
the real problems are obscured. It is like bewailing the
use of armored tanks in a war. Il is futile to bewail the
tanks, but it is useful to analyze the causes of the war
which make tanks necessary.
Thus, in considering the maritime strike of 1034, it
is necessary to observe first the economic causes and
the relationship between the strike, the contemporary
labor movement, and the preceding labor history of the
industry involved.
The maritime strike resembles the other contem
porary strikes in that: (1) the primary goal of the
strikers wk union recognition, (2) it developed a
young, vigorous, "rank-and-file" leadership. (3) i(
was NOT revolutionary, RUT (4) it does denote a
growing feeling of class - consciousness among
workers.
Preceding labor history shows that the recent strike
was not caused by section 7-A of the NRA code but
was the inevitable result of an intolerable situation
which had been developing for 20 years.
(This strike history will be considered in a snbe
scquent article tomorrow.)

Pacific coast longshoremen, seamen and their em
ployers today are fence sitters. They sit together in
peace atop agreement fence where they climbed last
August after the bloodiest and most expensive labor
revolt ever staged on the coast.
As long as inertia is maintained all will be well.
But the fence is rickety. It often topples. The position
of the sitters is precarious. If the balance of satisfaction
between the sitters is upset and the fence topples to
the left (if either of the two factions starts trouble
with a lockout or a walkout, then there will be a repe
tition of June, July, August, 1934. But if dissatisfaction
causes the fence to fall to the right, then there will be
peaceful settlement and all concerned will mount the
agreement fnce for another sit.
Either of these two movements are possible and
even imminent. This series will attempt to justify
this assumption presenting a complete and accurate
picture of maritime labor conditions, p*\st and pres
ent. based on a study of facts brought to the fore
by strikes of the past summer.
Strikes, contrary to common belief, are not incidents
brought about by specific and immediate causes, un
related to the other phases and stages of labor move
ments. Such an erroneous view comes from lack of
perspective and understanding of the real causes. An
observer who sees a strike from a superficial point of
view overemphasizes the dramatic, the sensational.
He sees wild-eyed, violent "Reds" leading simple work
men; bloodshed, and brutality as the inevitable result.
Strikes often do involve radicals and bloodshed, but
these phases are only incidental to the real issues.
True, it is sometimes justifiable to bewail the use of
militia or of "direct action" by the strikers, but such
bewailing is apt to distort the whole picture sc that
the real problems are obscured. It is like bewailing the
use of armored tanks in a war. Il is futile to bewail the
tanks, but it is useful to analyze the causes of the war
which make tanks necessary.
Thus, in considering the maritime strike of 1034, it
is necessary to observe first the economic causes and
the relationship between the strike, the contemporary
labor movement, and the preceding labor history of the
industry involved.

porary strikes in that: (1) the primary goal of the
strikers wk union recognition, (2) it developed a
