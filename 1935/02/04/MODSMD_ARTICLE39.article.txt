# BULL SESSION
## ANNA ELEANOR ROOSEVELT ROOSEVELT 
### 
When Democrats and Republican:-
cast their ballots for the New Deal
in '32, they thought they were voting
Franklin Delano Roosevelt into thsj
White Hou.se. They forgot, that along
with Franklin D. would come Anna
Eleanor, and a host of little Roo.se
velts.
A presidential family, of course,
is expected; the larger the better.
The American public likes that. It
likes to feel that the President is a
father, who like millions of other
fathers knows the tribulations of
crying babies, midnight milk bottles,
and afternoon diapers. If the presi
dential children are at times a bi<
unduly, the public is ready to for
give. But the public rightly expects
that a president of the United States
should at least be able to control his
wife. A president should be able to
do something that the average man
cannot do.
Anna Eleanor Roosevelt Roosevelt
is determined to prove that a wom
an's place is definitely anywhere but
in the home. Let no one think that
the First Lady does not like chil
dren; her personal life and her'one
time magazine, "Just Babies," proves
that she does. But Mrs. Roosevelt ha;;
been a "social worker," and ha.s never
gotten over it. She is public spirited
all right, but she must let the whole

| country know it.
On February 15 Mrs. Roosevelt!
will commence a new series of spon- j
sored air broadcasts. Whether this â– 
time the sponsor will be Royal type
writers, ov Simmons beds, is difii
cult to predict. Yet to some who feel
that there Ls still room left for dig- j
i nity in the White House, the an
nouncement grates no little. Even in
democratic America, a little of un
sullied pomp and circumstance is
! necessary to the continued respect,
, for the first position in the land.
It is one of the weaknesses of the
i political system in the United States
! that a president must dilute his dig
nity (and often integrity) by admix
tures of political wiggling. Still there
| is no good reason for the broth of
presidential respect being reduced to j
the level of dishwater. And that re-
I suit is certain to obtain when the
First Lady too, not only pokes her j
1 paws into the political stew (see her j
World Court address, and New York '
1 congressional race utterances), but j
casts her prestige into the commer- ;
cial brawl for the supremacy of a !
particular brand of typewriters or j
mattresses.
Yes, Mrs. Roosevelt, we like you,
j but not on the air.
