## Thief Makes Getaway After Robbing Two Students 
### 
One of the light-fingered gentry
invaded the Farm Saturday night,
and although taken into custody by
the acute detective work of Bob
Elfving, ticket-taker, the culprit,
while under the surveillance of a
timid Encina watchman, made a mad
dash for liberty, and effected his
getaway.
Tlie basketball game was the locale
of the pickpocket's nefarious opera
tions, where he relieved two Stan
ford students, Tom Boothe and
George Downing, of their wallets.
The Stanford men reported their loss
to Elfving, who made a check-up of
student body cards and found
Downing's card in the hands of the
unknown.
Elfving collared the thief, and
called campus police, who placed the
purse-snatcher in the Encina office
in charge of a new watchman, while
officers questioned boothe and
Downing.
The suspect, alone with the watch
man, watched his chance, and while
the keeper's head was turned, made
a desperate sprint for the door and
disappeared before the astonished
watchman could turn around.
