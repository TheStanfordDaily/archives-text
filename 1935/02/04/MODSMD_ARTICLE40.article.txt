Under the ground in a cellar in
Menlo under a table underneath a
table leg in a bottle and in the bottle i
is a fly and the green grass is grow- !
ing all around, all around. No more
will the fly buzz around Mellin
koff, though MellinkofT will still buzz
around the Daily office.
That fly is Mooney! Release him 1
I say! Out with him! Zounds! Re
lease Mooney, and you release
MellinkofT, and if you release Mel- j
linkofT why he'll go buzzing around
with his infernal questions, which
shock the ignorant masses, who
will in turn shock the enlightened
masses, who will in turn shock the
ignorant classes, who will give
MellinkofT an A so that he is a Phi
Bete in his junior year, and the
green grass is growing all around,
all around. (But he already is a
Phi Bete! Zounds!)
That fly is Hearst. Release him I l

say! Out with him! Zounds! Hearst!
in war, Hearst in peace, and Hearst
in the carts of his foundrymen.
Hearst doesn't want us to go into!
the World Court, because he has i
too many entangling alliances with
France, Mexico, and Hollywood. I do
not like the way he parts his hair. j
That fly is a Republican! Release j
him I say!' I do not like Republicans.
There are so few of him.
That fly is a Democrat! Release j
him I say! I do not like Democrats, j
They are too many of them. Con- j
trarywiselylike, I do not like Social- !
ists, Communists, free-thinkers, an
archists, agnostics, aesthetes. And
nobody cares for the Vocational
Guidance Committee.
I am not my brother Abe, and I
talk like this all the time
