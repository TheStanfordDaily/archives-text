### 
Editor, Sir:
It seems to me that our esteemed
Stanford audience indulged in a
mighty poor display of sportsmanship
Thursday night—a display of sports
manship that suffered doubly when
compared to the high standard set by
the competing athletes. One would
think that when these fellows spend
' hours and hours in training, and have
j the courage to be battered in the
I ring, that they deserve the courtesy
' of the crowd's attention while their
awards are being presented. Espe
cially when the guest has consented
to come all the way down here to
present the medals.
Sincerely,
Hal Underhill.
The Editor, Sir:
To Reviewer Brill: I am afraid you
take the remarks of the Messrs.
Freeman, Cayton, and Paris anent ,
"Forsaking All Others" too much to j
heart. You must realize that in re
viewing a movie you are reporting
for persons with so-called "movie
minds" as well as Econ students from
Hawaii and Southern California. Nec
essarily you must keep in mind your
audience and your medium of ex
pression (The Da'ily) neither of which
to my knowledge, have ever been |
accused of a plethora of critical dis- j
cernment.
As has been pointed out before, a
critic, to be fair, should mention (1) '
what he ate for dinner before the I
show, (2) the color of his necktie,,!
and (3) the shape of the bonnet worn !
by the lady in front of him "during j
the performance, for the conditions I

affecting of a theatrical
representation are numerous and
varied. And a tip to Freeman, Cay
ton, Paris: when you see a review
isigned "Brill," consider the possibil
ity that it may be a bit out of your
class.

, The Editor, Sir:
What is the purpose of the mythi
| cal "Union dollar" anyway? I under
stand that payment of this dollar is
a sort of membership fee to the
Union; and hence naturally supposed
that I was entitled to some sort of
privilege or courtesy other than that
of forking over my money for Cellar
meals.
And yet. despite my being a regis
tered student who has duly paid my
dollar for each of several quarters,
I find that the Union does not even
trust its members' checks.
To my mind, then, the four-bits I
pay for a haircut to the Union Barber
Shop gives me much more in the way
of privilege. "Jim, the Honest Bar
ber," as he has been called by your
illustrious sheet, cashes students'
checks of all sizes, and never do you
see "No checks cashed after such and
such date" sign hung out there.
Why not transfer the Union dollar
to the barber shop there, where at
least we are trusted? As it now
stands, the cash their "under
two dollar" checks at the Union, their
larger ones at Ihe barber shop, and
then when the Union cashing close;,
down entirely, they flock into the
