CHARLIE CHAN IN PARIS
At the Varsity Theatre
Button, botton, who's got the mur
; derer?
If you like sinister, baffle, baffle,
j baffle mystery with black-gloved
hands reaching through closed doors,
shots fired in the dark, the flash of
I a gleaming murderous dagger, false
j faces and dark glasses, you'll un
doubtedly like "Charlie Chan in
Paris." Personally, we don't.
Warner Oland's Chan is at least
consistent in that it is just like every
: other Charlie Chan the combined
talents of Mr. Oland and Mr. Big
j gers have created. Of course, there is
a love interest, and of course it is
: complicated by "the girl's" being
held by the police for the murders.
But the suave Chinese makes every -
thing come out all right in the end,
! just as you knew it. would —in fact,
] just exactly as you knew he would
so that his final monologue on just
how and why the mystery seems
I quite unnecessary. We knew it all
i the time.
"Maybe It's Love," on the same
i bill only turns the thumbs down
! further.
