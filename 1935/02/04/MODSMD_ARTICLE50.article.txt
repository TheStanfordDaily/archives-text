# RECORD-HOLDING RAIDERS SPLASH TO EASY VICTORY
## 
### JOHN McClelland 
Swimmers of Golden Gate Junior
college, living up to their reputation
of being one of the strongest swim
teams in the country, Saturday after
noon took the measure of Stanford,
57-33, taking seven out of nine pos
sible first places.
The Wandering Raiders turned
loose against the Cardinals three of
the classiest swimmers ever to enter
Encina pools — one hundred-yard
record holder Art Lindegren, back
stroke world's record holder, Bob
Walker, and 50-yard free-style
champion Haines Freeland.
These three were in a class by
themselves and, with the exception
of Lindegren in the 100 where
Etienne came within six inches of
tying him, scored easy wins in their
respective events.
Just as unbeatable was Stanford's
captain, Bob Foster, American rec
ord holder in the 440-yard breast
stroke. He stroked his way through
the 200-yard event to score an easy
win. And in the medley relay, when
he entered the water with a Golden
Gate man having a several yard lead,
he put on real pressure and covered
his distance within-a second of the
world's record.
One of the best showings Nort
Thornton's men made was in the
relay when they held an almost com
manding lead up to the last lap when
the powerful Lindegren crept up to

J win by a couple of yards.
i Besides Foster, only other first
point winner for the Indians was
Tom Boothe, who won first in the
diving with 134 points. Westley, Stan
ford frosh, took third place in diving
to score the lone point which the
j Cardinal Babes made in the meet,

Swimmers of Golden Gate Junior
college, living up to their reputation
of being one of the strongest swim
teams in the country, Saturday after
noon took the measure of Stanford,
57-33, taking seven out of nine pos
sible first places.
The Wandering Raiders turned
loose against the Cardinals three of
the classiest swimmers ever to enter
Encina pools — one hundred-yard
record holder Art Lindegren, back
stroke world's record holder, Bob
Walker, and 50-yard free-style
champion Haines Freeland.
These three were in a class by
themselves and, with the exception
of Lindegren in the 100 where
Etienne came within six inches of
tying him, scored easy wins in their
respective events.
Just as unbeatable was Stanford's
captain, Bob Foster, American rec
ord holder in the 440-yard breast
stroke. He stroked his way through
the 200-yard event to score an easy
win. And in the medley relay, when
he entered the water with a Golden
Gate man having a several yard lead,
he put on real pressure and covered
his distance within-a second of the
world's record.
One of the best showings Nort
Thornton's men made was in the
relay when they held an almost com
manding lead up to the last lap when
the powerful Lindegren crept up to

J win by a couple of yards.
