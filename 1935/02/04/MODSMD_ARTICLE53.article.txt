# FROSH HOOPSTERS RALLY TO DEFEAT U.C. CUBS, 54-33
## Also Trounce Berkeley High 36-21, after Trailing 14-11 at Half 
### Gordon Frost 
Twice during the past week end j
Stanford's frosh basketball team felt j
the sting ol near defeat and twice that ,
same team came back to pull its |
games'out of the fire, winning from i
California frosh 43-33 Friday night
and Berkeley high school 36-22 I
Saturday.
It was a nervous, mentally tied-up J
ball team that stai'ted for Stanford j
Friday night. The loss of first string
center Bob Zonne, who was hospi
talized two hours before the game
with a sudden attack of the flu,
showed its effect on the remainder j
of the team, as did the fact that it was I
their first "little Big Game."
Cubs Surprise
Hank Luisetti, who took high score |
honors with 19 points, started action I
against the Cal Cubs by sinking the !
first basket. But the frosh, with j
Byron Forderhase replacing Zonne, |
seemed unable to find their pace and j
passing and shooting were poor. !
Forderhase recently suffered a brok- |
en nose and had been unable to !
scrimmage strenuously.
California was functioning well.'
Goldman and Carlisle led the quick j
! passing, accurately shooting aggre
j gation of Cubs to a substantial lead, 1
j and when half time came Stanford's
unbeaten frosh trailed 11-20.
Soon Take Lead
Just what Coach Jimmie Bradshaw
! said to his men during the half time
I is not fully known, but it was a re
juvenated team that stepped onto the
1 floor to start the last period. Dick ,
Lyon had replaced Forderhase and
Nelly Heath, H. B. Lee, Luisetti and
Clarence Maurer completed the'
i lineup.
In less than three minutes this in
| spired squad piled up nine points to
1 tie the score at 20-20. Again passing,
shooting and breaking in their usual
: good form, the Stanford team soon ,
j had a 36-24 advantage. Bill Hulburt :
! replaced Maurer at forward, and the !
: Cardinal quintet continued to build ,
l up its lead despite the efforts of its j
! hard playing, under-rated opponents j
j to win 54-33. *
Preps Prove Strong
Dopesters declared that Stanford 1
I was playing a set-up game Saturday j
j night but before the evening was |

1 half, allowing the preps to take a
1 14-11 lead.
Bradshaw sent his first string, ,vith
Lyon for Zonne, into the game for
the second half and after struggling |
for one quarter, this team managed j
to put Stanford in the lead. The final I
quarter saw the Indians start to j
click by tallying 14 points against j
j none for their baffled opponents and j
I winning easily 36-22.

Preps Prove Strong
Dopesters declared that Stanford 1
I was playing a set-up game Saturday j
j night but before the evening was |
over were agreeing that Berkeley
j high schdol had no set-up team. The
i Indian second string played the first !
1 half, allowing the preps to take a
1 14-11 lead.
Bradshaw sent his first string, ,vith
Lyon for Zonne, into the game for
the second half and after struggling |
for one quarter, this team managed j
to put Stanford in the lead. The final I
quarter saw the Indians start to j
click by tallying 14 points against j
j none for their baffled opponents and j
I winning easily 36-22.
Twice during the past week end j
Stanford's frosh basketball team felt j
the sting ol near defeat and twice that ,
same team came back to pull its |
games'out of the fire, winning from i
California frosh 43-33 Friday night
and Berkeley high school 36-22 I
Saturday.
It was a nervous, mentally tied-up J
ball team that stai'ted for Stanford j
Friday night. The loss of first string
center Bob Zonne, who was hospi
talized two hours before the game
with a sudden attack of the flu,
showed its effect on the remainder j
of the team, as did the fact that it was I
their first "little Big Game."
Cubs Surprise
Hank Luisetti, who took high score |
honors with 19 points, started action I
against the Cal Cubs by sinking the !
first basket. But the frosh, with j
Byron Forderhase replacing Zonne, |
seemed unable to find their pace and j
passing and shooting were poor. !
Forderhase recently suffered a brok- |
en nose and had been unable to !
scrimmage strenuously.
California was functioning well.'
Goldman and Carlisle led the quick j
! passing, accurately shooting aggre
j gation of Cubs to a substantial lead, 1
j and when half time came Stanford's
unbeaten frosh trailed 11-20.
Soon Take Lead
Just what Coach Jimmie Bradshaw
! said to his men during the half time
I is not fully known, but it was a re
juvenated team that stepped onto the
1 floor to start the last period. Dick ,
Lyon had replaced Forderhase and
Nelly Heath, H. B. Lee, Luisetti and
Clarence Maurer completed the'
i lineup.
In less than three minutes this in
| spired squad piled up nine points to
1 tie the score at 20-20. Again passing,
shooting and breaking in their usual
: good form, the Stanford team soon ,
j had a 36-24 advantage. Bill Hulburt :
