## Declare Air Force Clause Only Plausible Part Of Agreement ASK LEAGUE EQUALITY England's Stand on Rome Parley Not Clear

BERLIN, Feb. 4 (/P) â€”German of
ficials today branded the Anglo-
Fiench agreement in London as "old
stuff" and indicated there would be
Jjltle chance of Germany's accepting
it in its present form.
"With the exception of the
value of the aviation clause, the
Anglo-French accord presents
nothing new," said these officials.
"Germany's return to Geneva is
thrown in with the other ques
tions, whereas we hold it ap;\rt
from tlie other things.
"There is no chance of Germany's
going back into the league until
after we "are certain equality in all
respects has been actually granted."
In addition to the air clause, it
was felt here that England's adhe
sion to the Franco-Italian accord at
Rome was also unclear since "Eng
land already had agreed to consult
over the question of Austrian inde
pendence."
"The question now is," an official
said, "whether England stands
ready not only to consult hut to
lend military assistance to keep
Austria as she is."
The foreign office appeared con
cerned over the Austrian angle of
the Rome pact and has asked Ger
many's ambassadors to find out
whether the "hands off policy" ap
plies also to Italy and France or
whether it is entirely directed against
Germany.
"However, said officials, "there
are some good things in the London
accord and we will study it care
fully."
