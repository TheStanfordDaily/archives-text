# EX COMMITTEE PROGRAM LIGHT
## To Discuss Awarding Minor Letters to Poloists 
### 
A short meeting is in prospect for j
Ex Committee tonight, according to j.
A.S.S.U. President Marvie Kahn.
On his schedule are only a "left- j
over" Daily matter and an investi
gation of the awarding of minor j
sports letters to men who play polo j
on horses.
It is The Daily's bedraggled 15 i
cents whose good name will be drag- '
ged into the limelight tonight.
The work of the 15 cents probably i
will not be controversial, since the j
consensus of Ex Committee opinion
has been clarified on the subject: that
Ihe 15 cents should be set aside for
editorial expense.
The committee's task is to make I
this into a by-law tonight. In order !
to enact this as a by-law, a three- I
quarter vote will be necessary.
Kahn says: "I, personally, am very i
pleased with the way the 15 cents is i
used, and I think it has improved
the paper a lot." He thinks that any
money left over from the 15 cents I
should not revert to the student i
body, but should go into the building
fund.
The problem with horse polo j
awards in the past has been the fact 1
that the Ex Committee has had no
way to check up on ihe time the
p<. loists have played. A plan for
doing so may be figured out tonight.
Prospects of a short meeting to
night may be wrong. For the past j
four weeks there has been "a short j
meeting in prospect," but contro
versy has reared its ugly head.
