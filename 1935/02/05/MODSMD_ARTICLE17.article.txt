# Employers Study Grades When Hiring Applicants
## 
### HENRY TANI 
So that students may look more
specifically at future vocations after
graduating from college, Dr. C. Gil
bert Wrenn of the Vocational Guid
ance Committee makes the following
statement on "The Employer Looks
at a Senior."
"Students do not always realize
that business industrial employers
often scrutinize their grade sheets
quite carefully. In fact, there are
three sources of information upon
which the employer frequently de
pends: the academic record of the
student, his student activity record,
and information obtained either
first-hand or second-hand as to his
personality characteristics.
"One large corporation in San
Francisco which normally hires from
ten to forty college graduates a
year, has as personnel manager a
man who says that the most valuable
single indication of what a prospec
tive employee will do on the job is
a record of.what he has done scho
lasticaliy during his four years of
college.
"Donald Bridgman, assistant per
sonnel officer of the American Tele
phone and Telegraph Company, re
cently stated that graduate work

should lie taken only if llie student's
age is not more than the average of
college graduates, if he will not be
handicapped seriously by self-sup
port, if his intellectual ability is su
perior as indicated by his previous
college record, and if his graduate
interest is in a field where full-time
further training is necessary.
"Bridgman further suggests that
a man's search for a job should begin
with a thorough combing over of the
opportunities in his own community.
Watching daily newspapers and
trade publications for new busi
nesses or new developments in old
concerns will give valuable clues.
Bridgman believes that with an ex
pected population growth during the
next decade of only 7 per cent, we
should nol expect more than a 15 per
cent growth in industrial activity.
"This means, according to Mr.
Bridgman, thai industrial opportuni
ties for college graduates will be on
the decline in the near future. He
thinks this is a good trend, since it
will make the dominant motive for
an undergraduate college career a
real interest in intellectual things
rather than a desire for .specific oc
cupnt ional I raining."
