# UNION PROFITS DIVERTED INTO THEATRE FUND
## Associated Students Getting Back from Union More Than Dollar Value 
### Irvin Jorgensen 
Out of the rocky caverns of the
Campus Opinion Columns comes a
voice, sad and prophetic, asking,
"What is the purpose of the 'Union
dollar,' anyway?"
That it is a membership fee is
true, .but that the Associated Stu
dents are getting back from the
Union more than the dollar they are
putting in is also true.
Under a plan recently worked out
by the Union Board of Governors,
the Associated Students are sharing
in the profits of the Union, and get
ting back in profits, if the profits
continue as they have, more than
the total money paid out in Union
dollar.
The money going to the Associa
ted Students will be diverted into a
fund for building the New Theatre.
Besides the benefits which the
students derive from the Union it
self: use of grounds, use of Wom
en's Clubhouse and offices and com
mittee rooms for student govern
ment, Union profits will now con
tribute to the New Theatre.
Plan Explained
The plan, as announced by Stu
dent Manager Ben Cave is:
(1) GO per cent of the net opera
ting income of the Union for the two
years of '34-'35 and '36-'36 goes to
ihe Associated Students. The remain
ing 40 per cent goes into a reserve
fund to provide for financial emer
gencies.
(2) After these two years, and
until a reserve fund of $30,000 is
built up, 50 per cent of the profit
will go to the A.S.S.U. and 50 per
cent to the reserve fund.
(3) After this reserve is reached
and until a reserve of $50,000 is
built up, 75 per cent of the profit
goes to the A.S.S.U.
(4) After this reserve is built up,
all of the profit will go to the
A.S.S.U.
Union Makes $24,000
During the last fiscal year of the
Union, a profit of $24,000 was made.
Of yesterday morning's complaint
on the Union's not cashing checks
i'bove two dollars, and no checks at
all before finals, Student Manager
Cave explained that the reason the
Cellar did not cash checks above two
dollars was because it would "screw
up their accounting system," and
make it necessary to maintain large
amounts of till money on hand.

The money going to the Associa
ted Students will be diverted into a
fund for building the New Theatre.
Besides the benefits which the
students derive from the Union it
self: use of grounds, use of Wom
en's Clubhouse and offices and com
mittee rooms for student govern
ment, Union profits will now con
tribute to the New Theatre.
Plan Explained
The plan, as announced by Stu
dent Manager Ben Cave is:
(1) GO per cent of the net opera
ting income of the Union for the two
years of '34-'35 and '36-'36 goes to
ihe Associated Students. The remain
ing 40 per cent goes into a reserve
fund to provide for financial emer
gencies.
(2) After these two years, and
until a reserve fund of $30,000 is
built up, 50 per cent of the profit
will go to the A.S.S.U. and 50 per
cent to the reserve fund.
(3) After this reserve is reached
and until a reserve of $50,000 is
built up, 75 per cent of the profit
goes to the A.S.S.U.
(4) After this reserve is built up,
all of the profit will go to the
A.S.S.U.
Union Makes $24,000
During the last fiscal year of the
Union, a profit of $24,000 was made.
Of yesterday morning's complaint
on the Union's not cashing checks
i'bove two dollars, and no checks at
all before finals, Student Manager
Cave explained that the reason the
Cellar did not cash checks above two
dollars was because it would "screw
up their accounting system," and
make it necessary to maintain large
amounts of till money on hand.
Out of the rocky caverns of the
Campus Opinion Columns comes a
voice, sad and prophetic, asking,
"What is the purpose of the 'Union
dollar,' anyway?"
That it is a membership fee is
true, .but that the Associated Stu
dents are getting back from the
Union more than the dollar they are
putting in is also true.
Under a plan recently worked out
by the Union Board of Governors,
the Associated Students are sharing
in the profits of the Union, and get
ting back in profits, if the profits
continue as they have, more than
the total money paid out in Union
dollar.
The money going to the Associa
ted Students will be diverted into a
fund for building the New Theatre.
