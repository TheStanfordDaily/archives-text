# Rorty Speaks On Managing
## 
### 
Stressing the three-fold responsi- j
bility of the business manager to
shareholders, employes, and consum- j
ers, Colonel M. C. Rorty, president |
of the American Management Asso- j
ciation, spoke last night in the Little
Theatre on '"The Responsibilities of
Management."
"The greatest responsibility of a
manager is the obligation toward
his employes," Rorty stated. "A con
sistent policy of paternalism is re
sented by employes. We need a sys
tem of collective bargaining on a
co-operative basis that will satisfy
the workers and keep them from
growing discontented."
Emphasizing the importance of
economic planning in successful en*
terprise, he nevertheless stated:
"It isn't possible for any human
being to do all the planning neces
sary under the NRAâ€”we cannot
put too much power in any one unit
of society."
In defining the professional mana
ger, he stated that he is a money
maker who takes his fair share of
the addition of wealth to the com- |
munity and promotes the community
welfare; in return he is expected to
give the consumer fair prices, qual
ity and quantity.
