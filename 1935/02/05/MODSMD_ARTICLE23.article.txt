# Eligibility Unsure For Yell Tryout
## Decision on Ranzoni to Be Given Friday 
### 
"If Bob Ranzoni is declared eli
j gible for candidacy by Friday, tha
i constitutional number of six men
, will ruriwfor the two junior yell lead
er posts in the student body election
to be held next Tuesday. The other
five candidates will be Dick Bibber),
Bill Molineaux, Talbot Shelton, Web
Jones, and Howard Curr."
This was the statement made last
j night by John Brock, chairman of
| the A.S.S.U. election committee, in
i discussing exactly who is and who
| is not eligible for the post of as-
I sistant yell leader. Of the nine origi-
I nal men chosen, six regular candi
j dates and three alternates, three
l were declared completely ineligible
â€”Clem Smoot, Sheldon Riley, and
Bud Desenberg. In the case of Ran
zoni, however, a question arose as
his grade record just bordered on
j the eligibility line, too close for a
I definite decision. An examination
l grade to be determined Friday will
prove the deciding factor.
Yell Leader Jim Triolo in com
menting on the situation said:
"If Ranzoni is not eligible, five
j will have to be the number of men
. running for the office. It will be im
; possible to hold another series of
tryouts to choose the sixth man re
quired, because that would take all
quarter."
Junior yell leaders Ed Butter
j worth and Dick Stark will compete
j in the election Tuesday for the office
; of senior yell leader.
