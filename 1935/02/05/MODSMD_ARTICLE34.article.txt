# Mexico For the Mexicans
## 
### 
Tiio venerable senator from Idaho, William
I']. Honih, who was partially responsible lor
protecting the United Stales from the horren
dous nssoeiations with Kuropean nations
which were threatened hy the World Court,
is jousting with windmills again.
Borah is averse to "World Court" co-opera
tion with other nations, hut he is eager to prod
America into projecting its beagle in foreign
affairs where the interference is certain to
arouse international hatreds and misunder
standings. In short, Borah wants the I'nited
Stales Senate to investigate the purely do
mestic church-state conflict in Mexico.
Why the attitude of the Mexican govern
ment toward the Mexican clergy should be
of any consequence to the Senate, to Senator
Borah, or to the Idaho citizens whom he repre
sents, is hard to understand.
II Mexico, or Canada, or the provincial
government on the island of Whosis, should
suddenly decide to investigate fluey Long,
Tammany Hall, or the NBA, we do not doubt
that the honorable senator would rear up on
his 1(10 per cent American hind legs and roar
lo high heaven about foreign Interference.
Neither do we doubt that the proud blood
of the Mexican officials will boil with in
dignation at this proposal to bless the Senate
with the role of an international Hawkshaw.
.lust what could be done about the matter
should Borah's committee decide that the situ
ation was susceptible of improvement is also
hard to sec. They could hardly undertake to
call out Federal troops lo accomplish the
ravishment of the southern nation on such a
Hi insy excuse.
In recent years, American - Mexican rela
tions have been amicable; Mexico has been
governing itself with a minimum of internal
disturbance. Any further activity of our Sen
ate in this problem will only jeopardize those
relations, embarrass President Boosevelt and
Secretary of State Hull, and be all lo no avail.
Borah should accept the advice of America
and pull in the schno/.zle.
