# Permanency for the Rest Homes
## 
### 
When next .June comes around the Men's
Hest Home must once more take up its annual
peregrination to parts as yet unknown. Other
institutions on the Stanford campus remain
fairly stable and well-anchored but not our
friend in need, the Hest Home.
Last year when any world-weary Stanford
rough wished to withdraw from it ;i]l for a
few days he had to make the long trek to
Palo Alto, for that is where the Hest Home
was then established. All this year "the com
forts of home" could be had id it spacious,
comfortable place on the campus. Where the
weary rough will have lo go next year is still
unannounced.
What the campus obviously needs is a per
manent Men's Hest Home similar to that
maintained for the women. Although the
Women's Hest Home is privately owned, it
lias the advantage of permsinency and con
venient location on the campus. So far the
Mothers' Club has had to lease a home for
the men for short-time periods.
It the process of building or buying 5t per
manent home could not be linaneed, it might
al least be possible lo lease some place on the
campus for it long-time period. Let's anchor
the thing down and quit wandering around
the vicinity.
The Mothers' Club hits done a splendid job
in maintaining the rest homes and there is no
doubt that il hopes to place them on a more
permanent basis if ;i way can possibly be
found. Let's have some help.
