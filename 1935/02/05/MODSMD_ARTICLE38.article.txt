Figures have just been released showing the results
of an investigation sponsored by the Carnegie Corpora
tion anent the scientific study of Japanese-American
educational and vocational conditions extant today.
Dr. Reginald Bell, author of "Public School Educa
tion of Second-Generation Japanese in California,'' and
professor of education, has reached some interesting
conclusions after considerable research in the field.
The population figure of Japanese in America was
138,834 in 1930, of whom 68,357 were American-born.
It is with these second-generation Japanese that Pro
fessor Bell is chiefly concerned. lie states that of
1,383,650 individuals in California below the- age of 17
in 1930, 39,184, or slightly more than 2.8 per cent, were
children of Japanese parents.
Japanese are not evenly distributed over the state,
for anti-alien land laws have driven them from farms to
segregation in cities. Of the 39,184 Japanese-American
children in California, 13,499 or abftut 34 per cent are
in Los Angeles county. About 10 per cent of Sacra
mento county's minor population, 7 per cent of San
Joaquin's minors are of this racial group, Dr. Bell
states.
"Do Japanese--Americans have the intellectual
ability of white Americans? Do they measure up to
other American children in school achievement?" we
ask. On the answers to these queries the future eco
nomic security of Japanese children, in large measure,
hinges.
"The pupils of Japanese parentage in the junior and
senior high schools of the cities of California are more
successful than their fellow non-Japanese students if
one judges on the basis of high marks received,"
observes Dr. Bell.
"Their greatest relative success in securing high
grades comes in non-academic subjects such as shop
work, mechanical drawing, foods and clothing, and
printing. But they continue to secure more high grades
and fewer low ones in science, social studies, mathe
matics, and even English and foreign languages. The
explanation of this may lie in the many things aside
from actual school achievement — docility, industry,
promptness, home pressure — that teachers' marks
register.
"There seems to be a tendency for pupils of Japa
nese parentage to perform relatively less well as they
move into the higher levels. I believe, however, that the
selective factors which eliminate the less capable among
the American white children in the higher grades do
not operate among the Japanese. Consequently compe
tition becomes keener for their group, which in turn
becomes a group of relatively less ability."
"With the passage of the Immigration Bill of 1924,
Japanese, except for certain privileged classes of stu
dents, business agents, and the like, were excluded from
immigrants eligible for entry into the United States,"
concludes Dr. Bell. "Anti-alien land laws have removed
the fear of 'the white race being driven from the land.'
Exclusion legislation has removed the fear of the white
race 'being crowded into the sea.' Wholesale anti-
Japanese agitation bids fair to become a phenomen
of the past."
