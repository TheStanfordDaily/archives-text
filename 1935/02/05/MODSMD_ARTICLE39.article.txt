Significant as is nothing else in the consideration of
maritime strikes on the Pacific Coast is labor history.
When the long trend of events prior to the great strike
of 1934 are observed, the popular theory that the recent
labor revolt was instigated by Communists and alien
radicals, merely seeking to cause strife, is reduced to
absurdity. Such observations also put the belief that
labor is licked and that maritime peace is permanent
in the category of reductio ad absurdum.
In the long stretch from 1902 to 1921, the Sailors'
Union of the Pacific enjoyed a closed shop and full
recognition from the Shipowners's Association. The
International Longshoremen's Association, however,
was ignored in San Francisco by employers. Union
organization efforts in 1916 precipitated a strike which
ended with a virtual armistice.
During the war all trouble was staved off, but in
1919, during a nation-wide strike wave, the longshore
men struck a second time. It was a blunder. Employers
actually welcomed it and sat back and grinned. The
strike was a failure because there was no unity. While
it raged in one port, traffic was diverted to other ports
and the seamen, bound to peace by an agreement with
their employers, did not offer assistance. This strike
broke the I.LA. and spawned a company union, the
so-called "Blue-book Union," whi*-h persisted until
1934.
In 1921 the seamen's agreement expired. Imme
diately, supported by the U. S. Shipping Board,
employers announced 50 per cent w'\ge cuts,
other "readjustments." Strike broke out, violent
and effective, but was finally broken by (1) court
injunction granted to U. 5.5.8.; (2) the prevail
ing mass of unemployed. (3) the non-co-operation
of longshoremen, (4) the lack of public support, due
to newspapers playing up the "red scare." (the ace
in-the-hole that S. F. papers pulled out last
summer.)
This strike broke the union. Open shop prevailed,
wages were cut to 50 per cent of the pre-strike level and
maintained throughout the entire period of "prosper
ity" and high prices (1923-29). The seamen were made
bitter by this experience and settled down to wait for
the day when successful action could be taken. The
longshoremen also were without independent union
power under the company controlled "Blue-book
Union."
Conditions in this period in brief were: a large
reserve of unemployed, all members of the company
union; existence of "star gangs"; maintenance of ef
fective "blacklist"; "speeding up" of longshore work.
Violently unsatisfactory w.ere these conditions to
most of the longshoremen and they, too, settled down to
await a day for protest.
Two things, however, were learned by the mari
time workers during this period, and learned well.
One: That within a union, there must he unity as
there is unity between neighboring ports. (The
lesson of the 1919 strike.) Two: That among mari
time trades (i.e., seamen and longshoremen) there
must also he unity.
Needless to say, these two lessons, thoroughly
learned in 1919-21, were never forgotten.
When, in 1933, the NRA became the law, the mari
time workers saw a ray of hope, a way of securing
real collective bargaining without a strike. Thus it
was that they went to the shipping code hearings in
August, 1933, hopefully.
But the code collapsed. Tine NT?A failed them. There
still is no code in this industry. The workers became
convinced that they would be driven to a strike, and
they were.
Tomorrow: The 1934 strike before the formation
of president's arbitration hoard.
