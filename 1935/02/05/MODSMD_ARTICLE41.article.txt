## 
### 
What are (.he signs of vitality in
I Criticism—that is, of vitality in the
j best ideas about life?
George Hinkle, instructor in Eng
| lish, gave a three-fold conclusion to
| the radio audience over KGO at 8
j o'clock last night.
| First, an enduring criticism must
| he disinterested, devoid of parti -
i sanship and special pleading. Sec
j ond, it must concern itself solely
j with its object, and not with what
| its object seems to suggest, and.
three, it must show itself at least
aware of the best ideas of the past
as well as those of the present.
In the eighties, when Ambrose
Bierce was a San Francisco editor,
until the time when he mysteriously
disappeared in Old Mexico in 1913,
he displayed his love for life and the
desire to penetrate to its secret at
all costs in his fiction and criticism.
He knew that the best writers do
j not devote their time to "problems"
! at all, but to ideas about life. Hinkle
j believes that Bierce was a critic who
i knew what true criticism should be
at the same time that he was indis
criminate.
"When all is said and done," stat
ed Professor Hinkle, "the best writers
are the best readers, and the best
I readers are those that hunger for
j and feed upon real ideas, from every

.
| quarter and from any time.
i "Ideas among men grow from the
I widening experience of the best I
j things. The very best writers of our
time, like the best writers of any !
| other time, have sought to under
: stand the present by applying to it
the best thought of the past.
"Colonel T. E. Lawrence, who
: gave us one of the finest books to
come out of the late war, 'The
Seven Pillars of Wisdom,' found
the whole secret of life, as he tells '
j lis; as lie sat in the dangerous des- (
crt of Arabia reading tint forgot -
| ten classic of our childhood,
; Malory's 'Morte D'Arthur'."
1; For good criticism, Hinkle sug- j
! gests that the biographer, for in- ;
j stance, would show us, not wherein,
, his subject was most like ourselves, |
but wherein he differed; or that the
i traveler should write of the Lap- ;
i landers not in terms of what we i
I think the Laplanders might be, if'
they had advantages of bathtubs and
! rapid transits, but in terms of what |
they do, think, and feel.
I "I could not do better by way of i
summary than to quote once more
| a definition by Ambrose Bierce," I
Hinkle concluded "A popular author '
jis one who writes on what every- ;
! body else is thinking; a great one j
| invites them to think of something
i else."

What are (.he signs of vitality in
I Criticism—that is, of vitality in the
j best ideas about life?
George Hinkle, instructor in Eng
| lish, gave a three-fold conclusion to
| the radio audience over KGO at 8
j o'clock last night.
| First, an enduring criticism must
| he disinterested, devoid of parti -
i sanship and special pleading. Sec
j ond, it must concern itself solely
j with its object, and not with what
| its object seems to suggest, and.
three, it must show itself at least
aware of the best ideas of the past
as well as those of the present.
In the eighties, when Ambrose
Bierce was a San Francisco editor,
until the time when he mysteriously
disappeared in Old Mexico in 1913,
he displayed his love for life and the
desire to penetrate to its secret at
all costs in his fiction and criticism.
He knew that the best writers do
j not devote their time to "problems"
! at all, but to ideas about life. Hinkle
j believes that Bierce was a critic who
i knew what true criticism should be
at the same time that he was indis
criminate.
"When all is said and done," stat
ed Professor Hinkle, "the best writers
are the best readers, and the best
I readers are those that hunger for
j and feed upon real ideas, from every

.
| quarter and from any time.
i "Ideas among men grow from the
I widening experience of the best I
j things. The very best writers of our
time, like the best writers of any !
| other time, have sought to under
: stand the present by applying to it
the best thought of the past.
"Colonel T. E. Lawrence, who
: gave us one of the finest books to
come out of the late war, 'The
Seven Pillars of Wisdom,' found
the whole secret of life, as he tells '
j lis; as lie sat in the dangerous des- (
crt of Arabia reading tint forgot -
| ten classic of our childhood,
; Malory's 'Morte D'Arthur'."
1; For good criticism, Hinkle sug- j
! gests that the biographer, for in- ;
j stance, would show us, not wherein,
, his subject was most like ourselves, |
but wherein he differed; or that the
i traveler should write of the Lap- ;
i landers not in terms of what we i
I think the Laplanders might be, if'
they had advantages of bathtubs and
! rapid transits, but in terms of what |
they do, think, and feel.
I "I could not do better by way of i
summary than to quote once more
| a definition by Ambrose Bierce," I
Hinkle concluded "A popular author '
jis one who writes on what every- ;
! body else is thinking; a great one j
| invites them to think of something
i else."
