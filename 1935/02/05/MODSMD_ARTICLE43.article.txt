"TIIE COUNTY CHAIRMAN"
At tb.e Stanford Theatre
With apologies to Gertrude Stein,
Will Rogers is Will Rogers is Will
Rogers is Will Rogers. That is to say,
"The County Chairman" follows the
, usual Rogers formula for a good
picture; plenty

of homely wit
and humor, in
volving a ro
mance and Will
in the role of
cupid.
This time the
romance wit h

which Rogers toys is between his
young law partner and the daughter
of the girl who jilted him in his
youth. Complications arise when
the unwilling lawyer is nominated by
Rogers to run for the office of prose
cuting attorney against the father
of the girl.
Typical Rogerism: "All you have to
do," he says to his candidate during
; the campaign, "is 'point with pride'
arid 'view with alarm,' and I'll do
the rest." B. Sweet
