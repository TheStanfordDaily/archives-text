# CAMPUS OPINION
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
In defense of Mr. Brill and the
eternal standards of artistry, I wish
to correct the impression that ihe
entire campus is opposed to the
Reviewer's stand on "Forsaking All
Others." Granted that a critics
function is to predict whether a pro
duction will interest and amuse his '
particular public, he should be al
lowed to apply some permanent ar
tistic standards. A play may con
tain much of artificial entertain
ment value and still violate the
accepted requirements of playcraft.
A self-respecting critic may at- i
tempt a judgment on this basis.
Sincerely, Bob Dwan
