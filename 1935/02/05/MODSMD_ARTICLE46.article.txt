The Edilor, Sir:
Shakespeare once wrote a play
called "Much Ado about Nothing."
While the various authors who have
written to the Campus Opinion con
cerning the recent criticism by Mr.
Brill are far from the plane occu
pied by William Shakespeare, they
are certainly t making "much ado
about nothing."
Mr. Brill is a critic who has the
courage of his convictions, and who
dees not hesitate to give an honest
opinion of the play or picture that
he is reviewing. If the opinions of
various other people do not coin
cide with his, that is only natural
After all, what a monotonous world
it would be if everyone thought
alike. Differences of opinion would
be taken for granted, but why, oh
why must an issue be made of such
a simple thing? There are matters
of far more importance to discuss
in this column than the tactics and
grammar of a reviewer.
In addition, when a situation
reaches the stage where it becomes
a personal matter it no longer is j
interesting or amusing to those not I
concerned.
Let's drop the subject.
Sincerely, PI. W.
The Editor, Sir:
Allow me to express my disap- i
pcintment, almost bordering on in-!
dignation, when I read the reviews!
of last week's concert in the two |
local newspapers, The Palo Alto
Times and The Stanford Daily. Both
reviewers produced on me the im- j
pression of people who were under
obligation to criticize a domestic,
production and were afraid to pro- i
nounce a favorable judgment lest j
some domestic cynics should charge |
them with a lack of taste.
Is it absolutely inevitable for an j
artist to have a 'iki' or a 'pin' to his
name to be favorably received by the
newspapers? Is it true that only the
first class artists are able to produce
enjoyable music? Hearing and see- j
inc great luminaries is very inspir- !
ing and highly "educational," but
riot always as enjoyable as hearing a
group of friends unpretentiously
playing in the intimate circle of your
own home and family.
And after all, great luminaries are
not born accomplished artists with
perfect technique and famous names.
They also, no doubt, in the begin
ning of their careers, had to play
before domestic audiences and local

> j reviewers. And if they had been mot I
I' with patronizing compliments and ;
r shallow criticism, they would not '
11 have grown to be what they are now.!
- It is the community that makes art. j
• 1 not artists alone.
I j It may perhaps be of some interest

i tists whom we are scheduled to hear I

; nition. Chaliapin in his autobiog

; rector of the Imperial theatres used

stinks of cabbage soup and vodka.
• j One can easily understand that with

' ; sitions. But we must remember that,
i if not the authorities, at least the
I Russian public, the communities of

j to appreciate and to reward their
! great musical revolutionaries.

with repeated references to the un
favorable position of the reviewer
that he happened to occupy in the
audience, and to the bad acoustic
conditions of the building.
The critic did not have to be bash
; ful or patronizing, for the perform
ance was an artistic success. It was
thoroughly enjoyable, not only for
the praiseworthy effort of the stu
dents participating in the perform
ance, but because it was intrinsically
good. Even though the voices of the
members of ihe glee club may be in

Allow me to express my disap- i
pcintment, almost bordering on in-!
dignation, when I read the reviews!
of last week's concert in the two |
local newspapers, The Palo Alto
Times and The Stanford Daily. Both
reviewers produced on me the im- j
pression of people who were under
obligation to criticize a domestic,
production and were afraid to pro- i
nounce a favorable judgment lest j
some domestic cynics should charge |
them with a lack of taste.
Is it absolutely inevitable for an j
artist to have a 'iki' or a 'pin' to his
name to be favorably received by the
newspapers? Is it true that only the
first class artists are able to produce
enjoyable music? Hearing and see- j
inc great luminaries is very inspir- !
ing and highly "educational," but
riot always as enjoyable as hearing a
group of friends unpretentiously
playing in the intimate circle of your
own home and family.
And after all, great luminaries are
not born accomplished artists with
perfect technique and famous names.
They also, no doubt, in the begin
ning of their careers, had to play
before domestic audiences and local

> j reviewers. And if they had been mot I
I' with patronizing compliments and ;
r shallow criticism, they would not '
11 have grown to be what they are now.!

' ; sitions. But we must remember that,

I Russian public, the communities of

opinion of the play or picture that

The Edilor, Sir:
Shakespeare once wrote a play
called "Much Ado about Nothing."
While the various authors who have
written to the Campus Opinion con
cerning the recent criticism by Mr.
Brill are far from the plane occu
pied by William Shakespeare, they
are certainly t making "much ado
about nothing."
Mr. Brill is a critic who has the
courage of his convictions, and who
dees not hesitate to give an honest
opinion of the play or picture that
he is reviewing. If the opinions of
various other people do not coin
cide with his, that is only natural
After all, what a monotonous world
it would be if everyone thought
alike. Differences of opinion would
be taken for granted, but why, oh
why must an issue be made of such
a simple thing? There are matters
of far more importance to discuss
in this column than the tactics and
grammar of a reviewer.
In addition, when a situation
reaches the stage where it becomes
a personal matter it no longer is j
interesting or amusing to those not I
concerned.
Let's drop the subject.
