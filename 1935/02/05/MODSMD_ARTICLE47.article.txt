Tonight in San Francisco's Civic 1
Auditorium Stanford's basketball 1
varsity meets the University of San
Francisco cagers in a mid-week ,
warm-up for the important league
names with the Trojans this Friday ,
and Saturday in Los Angeles. The 1
Card-Don game will follow the i
Santa Clara-Olympic Club contest ;
and will probably get the floor short- j
ly after 9 o'clock.
Indians Not Underdogs
Though having the reputation of j
playing some of the best basketball
fjn the coast over a period of years, j
the present S.F.U. quintet will not
force the Indians into the underdog i
position (hat has been their lot hi j
most contests this season. Joe Mur
phy. a center, is the high scorer and j
ace of the Don offense, while three j
of the four other first string men j
are inexperienced sophomores.
Coach John Bunn will probably 1
start the five which came through
the Santa Clara win here Saturday
night: Keith Toppiifg at center, |
Howell Turner and Rod Bust at for- 1
wards, and Bryan Moore and Robin ,
Lindsey playing the guard positions. ;
Topping Works In Well
Topping's play in both the Bear
;>nd Bronco contests indicated that
the problem with the center post had I
finally been .solved. With recent in- ;
juries no longer bothersome and!
with football muscles completely
adapted to court play, Topping
worked into the Card offense with j
a smoothness which .should give the j
Cards an added strength for the
final halt' of league play, beginning
this Friday.
Last night's practice found A1
Page, veteran guard, ready to scrim
mage again, his shoulder dislocated ]
in the second U.C.L.A. contest ten
days ago set for action.
