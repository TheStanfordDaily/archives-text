default from Delta Tau Delta 2.
About half of the shots by Phi j
Sigma Kappa swished the nets, de- ■
spite close guarding by the Zetes,
who towered over their opponents I
at almost every position. This was in j
.sharp contrast to the Zetes' shooting, J
most of their set shots and tip-ins j
going wifd.
Ralph Nelson's high, fast dribbling
and his accurate shooting on the I
run with the right hand contributed j
largely to a Phi Sig victory, as did j
George Worley's work under the'
basket.
Robert Wardwell was' quick on j
recoveries off the backboard, and j
when the game was tied in the last |
two minutes at 24-all he twice es- j
caped the guarding of Jack Walton |
and Gordon Dunn for the deciding i
.scores.
Bill Beatty's three field goals, and j
Bill Saxe's 7 points turned the tide j
in favor of D.U. over the Chinese I
Club, which was led in scoring by i
Won Chan, with eight points.
El Campo's easy victory over the J
Alpha Sigs was paced by Harold j
Fylkerson, who scored 12 points, j
Fi ank Van Schaick and Dick Beck
ett scored four apiece for Alpha Sig. |
The victory puts El Campo in as j
champions of their league, if they
defeat Independent 1 in a game to
be played next week.
