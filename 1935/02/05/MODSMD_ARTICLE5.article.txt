# STANFORD MAY ENTER N.C.A.A.
## Berkeley Chosen as Locale Of National Meet 
### 
The probability that Stanford will
defend both her 1.C.4-A. and N.C.
A.A. track championships was strong
last night when it was learned that
this year's N.C.A.A. competition will
be in Berkeley.
An Associated Press bulletin last
night said the California site for the
14th annual meet had been con
firmed, and that the meet would
probably be held June 21 and 22.
Will Not Conflict
That date and place will offer no
conflict with spring quarter exami
nations, and Faculty Athletic Com
mittee and Board of Athletic Con
trol officials, contacted in connection
with the probability of Stanford's
entrance, said there could be "no
possible Objection, unless it conflicts
with finals."
"I can see no reason whatever
why Stanford should not enter the
National Collcgiates at Berkeley,
particularly if the meet does not
conflict with final examinations,"
Alfred R. Masters, graduate mana
ger of the 8.A.C., said when in
formed of the decision to hold the
meet across the B^y.
Dr. J. P. Mitchell, secretary of the
faculty committee, speaking unoffi
cially for the committee, said he
could see no reason for any objec
tion from his group.
Templeton Pleased
Highly pleased. Coach Dink Tem
pleton, still confined to a hospital
bed with influenza, remarked, "Hav
ing the meet at Berkeley makes it
a cinch for us to go."
It was Templeton who brought up
the probability that because of the
N.C.A.A. decision, Stanford may go
to the 1.C.4-A. again this spring.
"There will be almost no expense
in connection with the Berkeley
meet," Dink said, "so there is no
reason why we can't go to the I.C.
A.A.A.A. for our trip this year. It
won't be too near finals, so the Fac
ulty Athletic Committee will have
no grounds for objection."
B.A.C. Will Decide
Templeton said the matter of I.C.
4-A. entrance lay directly with the
Board of Athletic Control, and that
since it would not conflict with ex
aminations, he did not expect the
faculty committee to interfere with
a B.A.C. decision.
On thre question of Stanford's
chances of successfully defending
both meets, Templeton was almost
"cocky." He insisted the Indians
would have just as good a "national
meet" team as they did last year."
