CONFERENCE STILL
EXISTS, THEORETICALLY

There is a body of some ten !
schools on the Coast that calls it- i
self the Pacific Coast Conference.
It is supposed to arrange for ath
letic combat between member teams ;
in the various sports, and to give j
the student populace in the .scat- j
tered localities a chance to match j
brain, brawn, and whatever it takes j
to be an athlete, one with the other, i
So they still pick a conference j
champion in football. Of course, I
it usually ends up in a three-way j
tie among gridiron teams that }
have never played cadi other, but
once in a while, like last year, [
one of the ten teams happens to |
get through without defeat or tie, ■
while all the others are beaten, ;
and that makes it fine. Right there j
you have a champion of all the
Pacific Coast.
In conference basketball, things j
are a bit more fair, because the j
champion is determined on a basis J
of elimination. The winner of the |
southern division plays the winner I
of the northern division in a three- j
game series. That makes it infall- :
ible. All the schools in each divi- ,
sion actually play the other ones in J
that particular division.
But that's about as far as the
conference goes. At one time there j
was a minor sports carnival, which I
matched the ten schools in the j
less-commercial sports. But the ;
financial question makes payment
of the more distant teams' ex- j
penses out of the question, so the
carnival was abandoned.
Now the conference serves the j
highly useful purpose of dictating j
rules of play and rules of eligi-1
bility, but that is about the extent |
of its worth.

SHOULD BE BUILT UP
OR ABANDONED

I What is the remedy? It obviously
I is one of two things—either aban-
I clenment of the conference entirely
(or building it up so it is something
I mere than a figurative thing that
I only theoretically determines the
j title in a couple of sports and com
pletely ignores the other fields of
[athletic endeavor.^
Practically, the "Big Four" of
California means much more in
; almost every sport. But those
four—Stanford, California, South
ern California, and U.C.L.A.—are
not hound together l>y contract or
hy any league rules, and the win
ner each year can only claim a
mythical title.
For example, what can an in
dividual winner of the "Big Four"
.track meet, scheduled for Berkeley
May 18 claim for himself? He can't
say he is a California intercolle
giate champion, because there are
■ many colleges that are not included
in the competition, and the "Big
[ Four" has no official title. All ho
can rightly claim is that he is the
best man in his event in four given
universities—kind of a glorified in
tramural champion.
The "Big Four," were it incorpo
rated into any kind of an official
organization, would really mean
I something, since the four institu
j lions included actually meet each
| other in nearly every sport, major
! and minor.

financial question makes payment
of the more distant teams' ex- j
penses out of the question, so the

SHOULD BE BUILT UP
OR ABANDONED

I What is the remedy? It obviously
I is one of two things—either aban-
I clenment of the conference entirely
(or building it up so it is something
I mere than a figurative thing that
I only theoretically determines the
j title in a couple of sports and com
pletely ignores the other fields of
[athletic endeavor.^
Practically, the "Big Four" of
California means much more in
; almost every sport. But those
four—Stanford, California, South
ern California, and U.C.L.A.—are
not hound together l>y contract or
hy any league rules, and the win
ner each year can only claim a
mythical title.
For example, what can an in
dividual winner of the "Big Four"
.track meet, scheduled for Berkeley
May 18 claim for himself? He can't
say he is a California intercolle
giate champion, because there are
■ many colleges that are not included
in the competition, and the "Big
[ Four" has no official title. All ho
can rightly claim is that he is the
best man in his event in four given
universities—kind of a glorified in
tramural champion.
The "Big Four," were it incorpo
rated into any kind of an official
organization, would really mean
I something, since the four institu
j lions included actually meet each
| other in nearly every sport, major
! and minor.

CONFERENCE STILL
EXISTS, THEORETICALLY

There is a body of some ten !
schools on the Coast that calls it- i
self the Pacific Coast Conference.
It is supposed to arrange for ath
letic combat between member teams ;
in the various sports, and to give j
the student populace in the .scat- j
tered localities a chance to match j
brain, brawn, and whatever it takes j
to be an athlete, one with the other, i
So they still pick a conference j
champion in football. Of course, I
it usually ends up in a three-way j
tie among gridiron teams that }
have never played cadi other, but
once in a while, like last year, [
one of the ten teams happens to |
get through without defeat or tie, ■
while all the others are beaten, ;
and that makes it fine. Right there j
you have a champion of all the
Pacific Coast.
In conference basketball, things j
are a bit more fair, because the j
champion is determined on a basis J
of elimination. The winner of the |
southern division plays the winner I
of the northern division in a three- j
game series. That makes it infall- :
ible. All the schools in each divi- ,
sion actually play the other ones in J
that particular division.
But that's about as far as the
conference goes. At one time there j
was a minor sports carnival, which I
