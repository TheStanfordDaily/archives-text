# VICTORIES OVER BRUINS, DONS PUTS CAL, CARD RUGGERS AT TOP OF CONFERENCE
## 
### 
Stanford and California emerged i
over the week end as the two teams !
to win in the state rugby conference. !
The Cards beat the strong U.S.F.
Dons, and the Bears won from the-*!
strong U.C.L.A. Bruins.
The U.S.C. fifteen as yet remains
untried in league play. Next Satur- !
day. however, the untried Trojans
will be tried in a very positive man- ,
ner at Berkeley when they take on
Coach Eddie Graff's unbeaten ag- j
gregation.
The Bears are reported to have im- j
pressed with tneir showing Satur- :
day, for they won, 9-3, against a re
puted bang-up Bruin teiim, headed i

gridster who caused Bill Ingram's
men so much trouble last fall.
The Troy-Bear game will iron out i
more speculation, both about con- ;
ference superiority and about the
kind of rugby played in the south
as compared to that in the bay:
region. The Cal victory over West- J
wood makes the north one up. S. C..
however, has looked good so far, j
brrring a disastrous first-game de- |
feat to "Pete's All-Stars," and has i
won several minor games.
