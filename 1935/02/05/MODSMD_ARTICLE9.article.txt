### 
A full-fledged concert orchestra
of twenty-three pieces makes its
campus debut with Friday night's
showing of "Her Master's Voice."
"If the play itself weren't so high
ly worth seeing, I'd consider it worth
while going to hear the orchestra
alone," recommends Manager Dick
Frank enthusiastically.
The orchestra was formed espe
cially to provide music for the play,
which features numbei's written by
Clare Kummer. Myron Birnbaum
recruited the members from the
campus band and symphony orches
tra, and has led the group in one
previous appearance. They played

W. Alettei"; and selections from.

Talented Cast
Two selections are included in the
play itself: first, "Sweet and Low,"

for students not attending "Her Mas
ler's Voice."
Seat sale for the play continues
today in the A.S.S.U. office in the
Old Union. Prices are 50 and 75
cents and one dollar.
A full-fledged concert orchestra
of twenty-three pieces makes its
campus debut with Friday night's
showing of "Her Master's Voice."
"If the play itself weren't so high
ly worth seeing, I'd consider it worth
while going to hear the orchestra
alone," recommends Manager Dick
Frank enthusiastically.
The orchestra was formed espe
cially to provide music for the play,
which features numbei's written by
Clare Kummer. Myron Birnbaum
recruited the members from the
campus band and symphony orches
tra, and has led the group in one
previous appearance. They played
for the three-day run of "Mr. Pim
Passes By" at the Palo Alto Com
munity Theatre, beginning January
25.
New Numbers Added
Several pieces have been added
for the initial campus appearance.
Two additional numbers have also
enlarged the repertoire.
The concert orchestra is sched
uled to play an overture, selections
from "The Desert Song," by Sig
mund Romberg; as entre'act "Sere
nade" by Toscelli; "Rendezvous'-' by
W. Alettei"; and selections from.
Romberg as exit number.
Talented Cast
Two selections are included in the
play itself: first, "Sweet and Low,"
a duet by David Devlin and Bud
Wilson. Directors William Murray
Timmons faced a difficult .problem
when he attempted to find a cast
talented both vocally and dramati
cally.
Kay Comrie and Bud Wilson sing
"Only With You," composed by
author Clare Kummer. As the cur
tain rises, Kay Comrie sings an ex
cerpt from "El Vocio" by Arditi, also
accompanied by the orchestra.
"For those who have been clam
oring for a spring musical, and also
those who backed a light comedy,
here is the perfect combination,"
decided Dick Frank.
After the play the Stanford Cardi
nals will sponsor a dance in the
Women's Gymnasium. Admission is
25 cents per couple for those with
stubs from the play, and 50 cents
for students not attending "Her Mas
ler's Voice."
Seat sale for the play continues
today in the A.S.S.U. office in the
Old Union. Prices are 50 and 75
cents and one dollar.
