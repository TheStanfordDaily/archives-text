# Comical Situations In Campus Comedy Make Unique Plot
## Director Timmons Says Cast Prepared to Give Campus "Fine Show" Friday 
### Annalee Whitmore 
A wife who leaves the husband
.•■he adores—a mother who wanted
to be an opera star by proxy—a hus
band who finds himself famous over
night, much to his annoyance —
these are the principal ingredients
in the comical mixture of "Her
Master's Voice," to be served to the
Stanford audience in the Assembly
Hall at 8:15 o'clock Friday evening.
Director William Murray Tim
mons has been preparing the delec
table dramatic dish since the end of
last quarter, and predicts "great
things" for Friday's showing.
Wants Career
The plot concerns Queena Far
rar, young, lovely, and with a fine
voice. She is married to Ned, a gay,
irresponsible young man adept at
everything from vacuum-cleaning
to radio programs. Ned is charming,
but provides poor financial backing,
much to the disgust of his mother
in-law,
Queena's aunt, like her mother,
wants an operatic career for her
protege. Her "disappointing" mar
riage of course has prevented this.
When the aunt visits the family,
fails to control her servants, gets
amiably drunk, confuses Ned with
the working man, falls in love with
the wrong person, and finally kid
naps her niece, action reaches a cli
max of rare comedy.
"Best" Comedy
The play was awarded the title
of "one of two best comedies" of
last year. Sparkling dialogue, clever
characterizations, and side-splitting
plot all combine to make the farce
idea) for presentation to a campus
audience.
Small parts—the independent but
ler and the self-sufficient maid —
promise to be particularly well
handled. "Each player is capable,
experienced, and above all inter
ested," praised Manager Dick Frank.
Orchestra Accompaniment
A twenty-three piece concert or
chestra provides musical back
ground for the play. Clare Kum
irfer, author, also wrote a "them<?
song"—"Only With You." The over
ture, led by Myron Birnbaum, will
begin promptly at 8:15, with first
curtain for the play rising at about
8:30.
The last act is scheduled to end at
11 o'clock, so that theatre-goers
may attend the Stanford Cardinal
dance to be given in the Women's
Gymnasium.
