j mittee in the A.S.S.U. election will
i appear to speak and present their
j views at an open assembly to be
! conducted in the Union Court at
; 10:10 o'clock tomorrow morning.
This was the woru received from J
j A.S.S.U. President Marvie Kahn
lart night, after he had discovered
that such an assembly would have
to be held in order to conform with
j the constitutional regulations on
j elections. An open presentation of
| their views will apply only to Ex
| committee candidates, says Kahn,
| but if anyone fails to appear at the |
j assembly, he will have automatically

| declined to run for office. The puh
i lie address system has been ob- 1
i lained for the event.
