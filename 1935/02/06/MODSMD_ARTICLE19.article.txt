### 
Swinging into scoring stride, Stan -
ford's varsity basketball team scored
a 48-33 win over University of San
Fiancisco on the San Francisco Civic
Auditorium floor last night.
Flashy forward Howell Turner
was Stanford's man of the evening,
tallying 18 points, as did also Joe
Murphy, S.F.U.'s rangy center.
Keith Topping ran second with 10
points made.
The Stanford team that accounted
for last night's victory was a far
smoother squad than spectators saw
perform last week. Five minutes
filter the first whistle the score
stood tied-up, 6-6, and then the
combination of Topping, Turner and
Dinty Moore began to function.
Breaking well and shooting accura
tely, the Cardinal team piled up a
substantial lead to make the half
time score 31-17.
The second half saw U.S.F. led by
center Murphy tighten up to gain on
Ihe Cards. With six minutes remain
ing the scox'e stood 42-32. Then the
Stanford offense, with substitutes
replacing all the starting men, began
to click again, chalking up six more
points before the final gun to make
the score 48-33.
Thursday the Stanford squad
leaves for Los Angeles where they
are scheduled to meet U.S.C. Friday
and Saturday nights.
