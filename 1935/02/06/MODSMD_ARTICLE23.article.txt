# Spain Topic Of Lecture By Alvarez
## Boss System During Rule Of Alfonso Discussed 
### 
Stating that the title of his lec
ture might just as easily read: "The
Funeral Oration of the Spanish
Monarchy," Casimiro Alvarez, mem
ber of the Board of Advisors of the
Del Amo Foundation, last de
scribed in detail "The Last Fifty
Years of the History of Spain," in
the Little Theatre as a feature of
the Tuesday Evening Lecture series.
Alvarez emphasized the preva
lence of the political-boss system in
Spain during the reign of Alfonse
XII. At that time there were two
political parties in Spain, the Lib
erals and the Conservatives, and a
change in the party in power
brought about a complete change in
personnel in all branches of the gov
ernmnt. Alvarez attributed this to
the fact that anyone who had been
a state minister, if only for five min
utes, received by law a pension for
life.
The recent "bloodless" revolution
in Spain Alvarez described as an
exceedingly peaceful change of re
gime. The royal family was allowed
to leave the country without being
molested.
The swing to the left which al -
ways follows a political upheaval
was of short duration in Spain. In
1933 a conservative coalition gov
ernment gained control and has
been in power ever since.
