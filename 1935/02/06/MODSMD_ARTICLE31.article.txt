I uiid, whieh the President is just as deter
mined to keep in his control.
Five billion dollars is quite some little
small change and 110 group of men can be
blamed for a very human desire to get their
lunch books into the booty. Hut somehow the
traditional "pork barrel" arrangement for the
disposition of government funds seems even
more distasteful than usual when such huge
funds are at stake.
II the real reason for the vociferous pro
tests of the "world's greatest deliberative
body" were a genuine desire to preserve its
Constitutional powers in government, as many
Senators and Representatives allege, it would
be a laudable motive.
Rut that is not the case, unfortunately.
Congress wants to control the money to en
sure distribution of the appropriations accord
ing to political needs, not according to human
needs. II is all too willing to surrender its
Constitutional power in almost any case â€”ex-
cept where money is involved.
Even at that, it is bad enough when it is a
matter of public knowledge that F.R. has the
five billion and docs not intend to use the
greater portion of it until 19.%.
However, the distribution (politically or
otherwise) will be much safer in the hands of
the President, who has the welfare and the
good-will of the entire nation at heart, rather
than that of any particular section.
