# An American Opera?
## 
### 
The quest lor ;i representative opera written
I)v :m Aincriciin composer has been lon# ;m<l
fruitless; instead of improving, the success
ive offerings have, if anything, declined in
quality. The latest, and incidentally the six
teenth native opus produced hy the Metro
politan company, is no exception in this re
spect. It was a complete Hop, if we lake the
word of critics and auditors.
Why Americans should he congenita llv un
able to wrile opera is n mystery; hut on ex
amination of this newest brainchild, the rea
son lor ils failure is not difficult to infer.
The scene of "In the Pasha's Garden" is
laid on the banks of the Bosporus Sea, a
place probably never visited by the author and
with which he is hardly well acquainted. Now
perhaps in opera this means nothing; the
music should sound just as well whether the
background is the Australian bush country or
Timbucloo, and the lyrics, perhaps, sound
artistic only when unintelligible.
Nevertheless, il is reasonable to expect thai
an American opera, in English, should con
cern a native subject, especially when our his
tory abounds in appropriate picturesque
backgrounds.
The composer of "In the Pasha's Garden"
is a Californian; here he had the rich heritage
of the missions, the padres, the old Spanish
rancheros. tie had the forlv-niners, the allur
ing pageant of the gold rush and the mining
camps.
Had he gone further afield he had the old
South, the negroes and their native music, the
plantations. He had the American Indian, a
great tragic people themselves.
In lad, this music makeu had a whole
storehouse of beauty from which to draw his
theme, and he loresook it all I<Â» entertain us
with a clammy will-o'-the-wisp tale about a
hazy land peopled with fairy beings.
And nobody cared. Let our ne\l native com
poser profit by this failure.
