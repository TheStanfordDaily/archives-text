Barhtira Holmes and Woody Adams decided
that the Associated Students does not need
any possible tw.cnly or thirty-dollar profit that
might accrue from Thk Daily's "fifteen-cent"
editorial budget, and voted to have any such
sum revert to 'I'm: Daily's building fund.
Hut Helen Hay moved that the question he
tabled until next week, when she claims the
vote of Hill Stark (who h;is missed several

A.S.S.f. backers.
It may be impossible, but Tin: Daily still
hopes that the campus won't be bothered with
this question again.
