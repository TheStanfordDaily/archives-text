### CHARLOTTE BURRIDGE 
With a provision for a constitutional convention for
revision of California's antiquated and complicated
document having been accepted by state voters at the
last election, actual preparation for carrying on of the
business will be under way shortly. There will be count
less names submitted, much political apple-polishing,
and strenuous campaigning on the part of a hoard of
jobless political aspirants. Many of those in the run
ning will be of mediocre ability. A number of the medi
ocrites will be elected. They will then proceed to take
up the important and highly technical problem of
giving California a new constitution.
This unfavorable situation ought to be remedied,
believes E. A. Cottrell, head of the political science
department.
"A commission of inquiry or information should
be established th,'«t would prepare for the delegates
of the convention all the things that they should
know in order to act with intelligence on the
matter of a new constitution."
Very few, if any, of the delegates will have delved
into the intricacies of the present constitution, and
fewer still would be able to understand it sufficiently
to act wisely in simplification of the legal entangle
ment.
"The ordinary group of people coming into a
convention do not have all the f.-wts they should
know. They hear only the propaganda and read
the publicity of interested groups. In all fairness
to the representatives and for the best interests of
the people for whom they are acting, a dependable
source of information should be established."
Though a permanent board of information for voters
and delegates alike would make possible intelligent
expression of opinions through medium of the ballot,
even a temporary commission for special problems
such as that of constitution revision is advisable, ac
cording to the political science professor.
Professor Gottrell has sent communications to
Governor Merriam advocating a plan whereby
outstanding authorities from four or five of the
major universities would he appointed by the gov
ernor of the state or the respective presidents of
the universities as a commission of education for
convention delegates.
