(Facts in this article taken from the personal

National Longshoremen's Boned.)
Failure to achieve a shipping code under NRA may
be suggested as one large factor leading to the mari
time labor revolt of last summer. The continurl refusal
to hear the workers' demands for shorter hours, higher
wages and increased job security caused the rumor that
a "strike was pending" to float as early as January 4.
The rumor assumed the proportions' of a coming
event on February 28 when the International Long
shoremen's Association of the Pacific Coast demanded
collective bargaining, $1.00 per hour and $1.50 for
overtime, and a 30-hour week, giving the employers
until March 7 to meet with them. Employers did not
procrastinate. They met on March 5. The longshoremen
insisted on coastwise agreement and a closed shop, and,
to emphasize their insistence, two days later announced
a strike effective March 23.
This first threatened strike was postponed at
the request of Roosevelt. On March 27 the Libor
hoard consulted with the I.L.A. and S.F. employers
in a preliminary meeting. In subsequent hearings
coastwise agreement and closd shop were the
principle issues with no less than 11 "grievances"
of the longshoremen as minor issues. The em
ployers' union declared a closed shop would be
"clearly unlawful" and they obviously couldn't
act for all employers on the coast.
On April 3, S.F. employers came forth with a plan
which included: Recognition of 1.L.A., interim adoption
of labor sections of proposed shipping code, dispatching
halls under joint control, separate handling of each
port's problems. It was refused. A strike for May 9
was announced on May 8.
On Pvlay 9, thinking direct action was their only
hope, longshoremen struck. On the same day the labor
board met with both sides and urged re-affirmation
of the April 3 agreement submitted to arbitration, but
neither party would agree. Other ineffectual confer
ences followed.
Following the strike of the longshoremen, other
maritime unions struck. On May 15 Assistant Secretary
of Labor E. F. McGrady arrived from Washington.
Almost innumerable meetings were held. Labor repre
sentatives, McGrady, I.L.A. President Ryan, Mayor
Rossi, employer representatives, citizens committees
all met, planned, schemed. The increase in the number
of meetings brought no reduction in the complicating
factors involved in a strike where 10 unions were
fighting a common battle and would not make peace
separately.
On May 28 the larger coast ports submitted a plan
which included acceptance of the 1.L.A., collective
bargaining by committees, joint committees to set ud
rules for hiring halls, no discrimination, hours and
wages to be submitted to arbitration.
Hate on both sides blazed up with this proposal
in a bloody riot on the waterfront. Masters, Mates,
and Pilots protested against police causing the riot
and against anti-picketing rules of Police Chief
Quinn.
On June 2 the men voted almost unanimously to
reject the May 28 plan. On June 5 the waterfront
employers finally announced they were willing to
accept govermental "supervision of participation in
the operation of hiring halls." This plan was worked
out by Madame Perkins. On June Hi ihe employers
offered a new proposal which provided for joint control
of hiring halls, no discrimination for union or non
union membership. The signing of the agreement wis
not binding on the 1.L.A., the constitution of which
provides for rank and file vote to start or end a strike.
Mass meetings up and down the coast refused the
June 16 offer and no agreement was made.
The first spark of the li)d'( of peace showed on
June 2(i when the President appointed the National
Longshoremen's Hoard. What (his board did will
he considered tomorrow.

procrastinate. They met on March 5. The longshoremen
insisted on coastwise agreement and a closed shop, and,
to emphasize their insistence, two days later announced
a strike effective March 23.
This first threatened strike was postponed at
the request of Roosevelt. On March 27 the Libor
hoard consulted with the I.L.A. and S.F. employers
in a preliminary meeting. In subsequent hearings
coastwise agreement and closd shop were the
principle issues with no less than 11 "grievances"
of the longshoremen as minor issues. The em
ployers' union declared a closed shop would be
"clearly unlawful" and they obviously couldn't
act for all employers on the coast.
On April 3, S.F. employers came forth with a plan
which included: Recognition of 1.L.A., interim adoption
of labor sections of proposed shipping code, dispatching
halls under joint control, separate handling of each
port's problems. It was refused. A strike for May 9
was announced on May 8.
On Pvlay 9, thinking direct action was their only
hope, longshoremen struck. On the same day the labor
board met with both sides and urged re-affirmation
of the April 3 agreement submitted to arbitration, but
neither party would agree. Other ineffectual confer
ences followed.
Following the strike of the longshoremen, other
maritime unions struck. On May 15 Assistant Secretary
of Labor E. F. McGrady arrived from Washington.
Almost innumerable meetings were held. Labor repre
sentatives, McGrady, I.L.A. President Ryan, Mayor
Rossi, employer representatives, citizens committees
all met, planned, schemed. The increase in the number
of meetings brought no reduction in the complicating
factors involved in a strike where 10 unions were
fighting a common battle and would not make peace
separately.
On May 28 the larger coast ports submitted a plan
which included acceptance of the 1.L.A., collective
bargaining by committees, joint committees to set ud
rules for hiring halls, no discrimination, hours and
wages to be submitted to arbitration.
Hate on both sides blazed up with this proposal
in a bloody riot on the waterfront. Masters, Mates,
and Pilots protested against police causing the riot
and against anti-picketing rules of Police Chief
Quinn.
On June 2 the men voted almost unanimously to
reject the May 28 plan. On June 5 the waterfront
employers finally announced they were willing to
accept govermental "supervision of participation in
the operation of hiring halls." This plan was worked
out by Madame Perkins. On June Hi ihe employers
offered a new proposal which provided for joint control
of hiring halls, no discrimination for union or non
union membership. The signing of the agreement wis
not binding on the 1.L.A., the constitution of which
provides for rank and file vote to start or end a strike.
Mass meetings up and down the coast refused the
June 16 offer and no agreement was made.
The first spark of the li)d'( of peace showed on
June 2(i when the President appointed the National
Longshoremen's Hoard. What (his board did will
he considered tomorrow.

Failure to achieve a shipping code under NRA may
be suggested as one large factor leading to the mari
time labor revolt of last summer. The continurl refusal
to hear the workers' demands for shorter hours, higher
wages and increased job security caused the rumor that
a "strike was pending" to float as early as January 4.
The rumor assumed the proportions' of a coming
event on February 28 when the International Long
shoremen's Association of the Pacific Coast demanded
collective bargaining, $1.00 per hour and $1.50 for
overtime, and a 30-hour week, giving the employers
until March 7 to meet with them. Employers did not
procrastinate. They met on March 5. The longshoremen
