800 SESSION
When the rebellious colonists
l gave King George the bird, and de
j clared for "life, liberty, and the pur
| suit of happiness," there is little
doubt but what they included the
I "right to boo - ' in their concept of
i "liberty" and of "happiness."
Booing is so tied up with Amer
icanism, that it is a bit difficult to
imagine the sort of emasculated in
dependence that would not include
I the famous bird from the Bronx. In
J Russia you can boo capitalism, but
j not Communism. In Germany you i
; can boo Communism, but not capi
j talism. In America and at Stanford.
| you can boo everything. That is
good.
Stanford students have taken a
| crude and simple thing like booing. 1
I and made of it a fine art. Nowhere
! else has the Bronx cheer reached
such sublime heights of deveiop
; ment. Indians can boo faster, neat-
I er, and louder than any crew of col- j
j legians in the country. But more
than that, Farm mey (and a l'<.'w 1
j women) are discriminating booers. !
| For puncturing inflated egoes, and
I pompously puffed-up drama, noth- i
j ing is so devastating and tidy and I
I appropriate as a healthy and reso
! nant boo.
I
Up till now Palo Alto theatres !
have accepted booing as the price of
student patronage. It was not only
enjoyable, but right. For if the
atre managers permit loud applause, i
they should also permit loud dis- j
approval. The commodity they are j
peddling is no more sacred than any
other.
During the past, week, the clammy !
j hand of censorship has descended on
j Stanford booers. The manager of
j cne Palo Alto theatre has martyred
; a Stanford man, by ejecting him for !
I a very timely comment on the cur
| rent -attraction. The man was an
i artist, and the manager did not ap
| preciate art. Though legally per- 1
| missable, the manager's action
j should not be allowed to establish |
j precedent.
It is enough that good theatre
seats cost 40 cents in Paly. If the
"right to boo" is not included in the
price of admission, the fee should j
at least be halved. For half the fun i
of many shows, and all the fun of
still more flows from this inalien- ,
able right.

When movies reach that state of
perfection which the Stanford 800
has attained, then the boo shall have
! outlived its use*in the theatre. Un
i til then, the boo must be defended
with the last lungful of Stanford's
j wind of freedom.
