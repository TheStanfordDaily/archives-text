The Editor, Sir:
How about doing something for the
women rooters at basketball games?
First an attempt is made to pass us
off as Cal women. That is bad enough,
i (Heaven forbid that we should ever
i be mistaken for any of them!) but.
ito add insult to injury, we don't
j even get a cheer-leader to help us
i drown out the enemy. My! My! Such
1 neglect. But seriously, don't you
; think something could be done about
I it? If given a chance I think we
, could do as well as, if not better
than, the men rooters. At least our
boos couldn't be quite as loud.
Hoping for the best, I remain,
A Disappointed W. R.
