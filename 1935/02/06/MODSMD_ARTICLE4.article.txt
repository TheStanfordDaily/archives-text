# Daily Money Still Open to Future Vote
## Retains Mass Interest Of Committee Members 
### Irvin Jorgensen 
j It's funny, but it's true: Ex Com
! mittee is still quibbling over The
Daily's 15 cents. Ex Committee is
fully agreed, now, that the 15 cents
remain with the editorial budget,
but the committee is still worried
| about the surplus amount that the
I editor might not spend.
; Seven Ex Committee members
! voted that the surplus money will
â–  revert to the A.S.S.U. But seven
| members were not enough to pass,
j Eight votes are required.
Editor Favors Building
Stan Beaubaire, Daily editor, who
' contended that there would never
i be more than 20 or 30 dollars left
i over, said it should be placed in the
building fund.
This view was borne out by
Woody Adams and Barbara
Ilolmcs, who withstood the test
of time, and three revotes, but
Vivhn Kay dropped by the way
j side on the first rcvote.
Those who thought that the money
1 should return to the A.S.S.U. were:
A1 Blackman, Vivian Kay, Bill Rog
; ers, Chuck Glasgow, Mort D'Evelyn,
; Helen Ray, and Sam Lee.
Ilevote Tuesday
But Ex Committee has not heard
the last of the 15 cents. It will be
back again next Tuesday night. The
seven members say they hope that
they'll have another vote in the fu
ture in the person of Bill Stark, ab
sent last night.
A proposal by the Cardinals that
the election of assistant yell-leaders
i be postponed until May so that a
! better qualified group of arm-wav
' ers might be selected, failed to get
j anywhere, when eight votes re
j quired to change the yell-leader
| by-law in the Constitution could
; not be mustered.
Okay Quad Money
I Minutes of Publications Council,
J giving a yearly salary of $100 to th?
! managing editor of The Quad, and
| providing a Quad building fund
1 set-up similar to The Daily's (money
j above a $3,000 financial reserve going
I into a building fund), were okehed
' without a murmur of dissent.
i The assembly for Ex Committee
| nominees to be held in the Union
court tomorrow morning was ap
! proved, after FranK Fullenwider,
i former constitutional committee
' man, called the committee's atten
: tion to the "forgotten by-law" that
required the meeting.
By-law Changed
Another "forgotten by-law" pro
vided for marking election ballots
with l's and 2's instead of x's. This
was changed to conform with elec
tion committee practice.
Sam Lee, Al Blackman, and Will
Eisner were appointed on a commit
tee to investigate the possibility of
1 changing the 120 unit requirement
for Honor Council nomination.
Frank Fullenwider was appoin
ted to confer with Ben Cave to
sec if there would be a possibil
ity of rounding up the "forgotten
liy-lavvs" and bringing them back
to the Constitution.
