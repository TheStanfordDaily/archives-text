"BROADWAY BILL"
At the California Tlieatre
This picture has a grand story,
fast tempo, and a great cast of
screen favorites. The action cen
ter. 1 ? around Warner Baxter, wh'>
walks out on his ice box-type wife
(Helen Vinson) and his patronizing

lather - in - Taw
(Walter Con
lTolly ). Baxter
prefers the race
tra c k to life
with his stuffy
family, and so
does his wife's
kid sister (Myr-

na Loy), who gives him inspira
tional and financial aid. As a beauty,
Loy always was a knockout, and
! she stays perfect here, even though
j Adrian of M.G.M. does not dress her.
! But Myrna has a rival for audience
| affection—Broadway Bill, the poor
: old horse whose pump bursts after
he fights his jockey to win the race
| for his master. Nowadays animals
must be getting much more intel
ligent, or so it would seem from the
movies. —Lows
