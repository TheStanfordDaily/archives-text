CONFERENCE MEET
SHOULD BE REVIVED

There is no apparent reason —ex-
cept finances—why the once-annual
Pacific Coast Conference track meet
Wat discontinued back in 1926. Fur
thermore, there is no reason why
the meet could not be revived and
become one of the big athletic class
ics of the country.
Il won't be this year; the sched
ule's are already made up, and. con
ference officials would not do any
thing so hurriedly as to begin talk
of a May event as late as Febru
ary.
But the coast-wide competition
on the cinder path is the athle(ic
event that would cement the con
ference's ragged edges firmly to
gether again, and it should become
an actuality, if not this year, per
haps in 1 !);{(>.
The financial czars of the ten
member schools object, from pe
cuniary reasons, so perhaps it
would be well to weigh a bit of the
factors for and against. Opposed to
the meet are certain facts:

MEET WON'T BE
SELF-SUPPORTING

1. The cost. The meet could not
hope entirely to support the trav
elling expenses of teams from all
parts of the conference. Each school
would have to put up a certain
amount 1o send its athletes. No mat
ter how large an attendance the af l
fair drew, it could not hope to be
more than half-way self-sustaining.
2. The time. A mutual agree
ment would he difficult to reach,
since the four southern schools
will insist that it he prior to May
18, the time of the I.C. 4-A. The
northerners, on the other hand,
claim that a date th,*\t early
would not give them a chance to
prepare for the competition, since
weather does not permit them to
get outdoors until spring is well
along.
3. The dominance of southern
schools in track. The smaller mem
bers of the conference could not
hope to win a team title, and hence
they oppose negotiations.
All of these points, however, ex
cept possibly the financial one, can
b" argued down to insignificance.
In the first place, were the meet
held in some population center, it
could be counted on for a good
crowd. Either San Francisco or Los
Angeles newspapers would be anx
ious to give it the proper ballyhoo,
and it would involve enough out
standing athletes to give it a na
tional importance that naturally
would draw as good a track crowd
as any sectional gathering in the j
country.

DATE WOULD FURNISH
A GREAT DISPUTE

The matter of getting together on |
a time would furnish a decided ob- I
slacle, and both sections would be |
stubborn. It used to be held before |
the Intercollegiates, but the north
on teams were never .satisfied.
Their claims that they haven't
enough time to train is legiti
mate. hut the fact remains that
they do work out indoors all win
ter, and Washington, for example,
met California last year and will
meet Stanford this season in a
dual meet. If they are willing to
do this, they should be willing to
give their individual st.irs a chance
against the whole conference.
It is true that Stanford, California,
raid U.S.C. probably would domi
nate the meet for the first few
years. But they do, as a rule, in
fcotball just as much—it.will be a
long time before Montana wins a
conference gridiron championship.
The latter argument falls flatter
lhan the other two. Instead of hu
miliating Montana, Idaho, and some
of the other lesser lights of the con- I
ference as football so often does, it
would give these schools a chance
to get their individual stars some j
national recognition.
In the last conference mpet, !
held here in Montana took |
three first places. Gillette, main j
star of the copper state, was in ,
fact the "hero" of the meet with !
his double victory in the mile and I
two mile, and Sweet won the 100- ;
yard dash in 9.7 seconds for the i
Montnnans.
This year, if the meet were ar- J
ranged, both Washington and Ore- j
gon would press the California :
Illinois for the fiist three positions.

The Huskies have a potent javelin
contingent, headed by Walt Rohr
scheib, who has a best of 199 feet.
They also have a long list of out
standing sprinters and quarter
milers.

OREGON LOADED
WITH TRACK STARS

Oregon's Webfeet also will fur
nish a strong, well balanced team.
Bob Wagner, captain and two
miler, is one of the best distance
men in recent years. Bud Shoemake
of Oregon has done 9.6 in the 100; as
a junior college freshman he beat
Abe Hables of Stanford several
years ago. John Stolp, a 6-foot-5
high jumper, can properly be con
sidered a. threat, too.
The problem has come up many 1
times in conference meetings, and
none of the guiding lights have a
concrete objection, but when it;
comes to voting, they still say nix.,
The four California colleges are all
for it, and Dink Templeton dfevoted

CONFERENCE MEET
SHOULD BE REVIVED

There is no apparent reason —ex-
cept finances—why the once-annual
Pacific Coast Conference track meet
Wat discontinued back in 1926. Fur
thermore, there is no reason why
the meet could not be revived and
become one of the big athletic class
ics of the country.
Il won't be this year; the sched
ule's are already made up, and. con
ference officials would not do any
thing so hurriedly as to begin talk
of a May event as late as Febru
ary.
But the coast-wide competition
on the cinder path is the athle(ic
event that would cement the con
ference's ragged edges firmly to
gether again, and it should become
an actuality, if not this year, per
haps in 1 !);{(>.
The financial czars of the ten
member schools object, from pe
cuniary reasons, so perhaps it
would be well to weigh a bit of the
factors for and against. Opposed to
the meet are certain facts:

MEET WON'T BE
SELF-SUPPORTING

1. The cost. The meet could not
hope entirely to support the trav
elling expenses of teams from all
parts of the conference. Each school
would have to put up a certain
amount 1o send its athletes. No mat
ter how large an attendance the af l
fair drew, it could not hope to be
more than half-way self-sustaining.
2. The time. A mutual agree
ment would he difficult to reach,
since the four southern schools
will insist that it he prior to May
18, the time of the I.C. 4-A. The
northerners, on the other hand,
claim that a date th,*\t early
would not give them a chance to
prepare for the competition, since
weather does not permit them to
get outdoors until spring is well
along.
3. The dominance of southern
schools in track. The smaller mem
bers of the conference could not
hope to win a team title, and hence
they oppose negotiations.
All of these points, however, ex
cept possibly the financial one, can
b" argued down to insignificance.
In the first place, were the meet
held in some population center, it
could be counted on for a good
crowd. Either San Francisco or Los
Angeles newspapers would be anx
ious to give it the proper ballyhoo,
and it would involve enough out
standing athletes to give it a na
tional importance that naturally
would draw as good a track crowd
as any sectional gathering in the j
country.

DATE WOULD FURNISH
A GREAT DISPUTE

The matter of getting together on |
a time would furnish a decided ob- I
slacle, and both sections would be |
stubborn. It used to be held before |
the Intercollegiates, but the north
on teams were never .satisfied.
Their claims that they haven't
enough time to train is legiti
mate. hut the fact remains that
they do work out indoors all win
ter, and Washington, for example,
met California last year and will
meet Stanford this season in a
dual meet. If they are willing to
do this, they should be willing to
give their individual st.irs a chance
against the whole conference.
It is true that Stanford, California,
raid U.S.C. probably would domi
nate the meet for the first few
years. But they do, as a rule, in
fcotball just as much—it.will be a
long time before Montana wins a
conference gridiron championship.
The latter argument falls flatter
lhan the other two. Instead of hu
miliating Montana, Idaho, and some
of the other lesser lights of the con- I
ference as football so often does, it
would give these schools a chance
to get their individual stars some j
national recognition.

held here in Montana took |

star of the copper state, was in ,

a time would furnish a decided ob- I
slacle, and both sections would be |
stubborn. It used to be held before |
the Intercollegiates, but the north
on teams were never .satisfied.
Their claims that they haven't
enough time to train is legiti
mate. hut the fact remains that
they do work out indoors all win
ter, and Washington, for example,
met California last year and will
meet Stanford this season in a
dual meet. If they are willing to
do this, they should be willing to
give their individual st.irs a chance
against the whole conference.
It is true that Stanford, California,
raid U.S.C. probably would domi
nate the meet for the first few
years. But they do, as a rule, in
fcotball just as much—it.will be a
long time before Montana wins a
conference gridiron championship.
The latter argument falls flatter
lhan the other two. Instead of hu
miliating Montana, Idaho, and some
of the other lesser lights of the con- I
ference as football so often does, it
would give these schools a chance
to get their individual stars some j
national recognition.
In the last conference mpet, !
held here in Montana took |
three first places. Gillette, main j
star of the copper state, was in ,
fact the "hero" of the meet with !
his double victory in the mile and I
two mile, and Sweet won the 100- ;
yard dash in 9.7 seconds for the i
Montnnans.
This year, if the meet were ar- J
ranged, both Washington and Ore- j
gon would press the California :
Illinois for the fiist three positions.

The Huskies have a potent javelin
contingent, headed by Walt Rohr

milers.

Bob Wagner, captain and two
miler, is one of the best distance
men in recent years. Bud Shoemake
of Oregon has done 9.6 in the 100; as
a junior college freshman he beat
Abe Hables of Stanford several
years ago. John Stolp, a 6-foot-5
high jumper, can properly be con
sidered a. threat, too.
The problem has come up many 1
times in conference meetings, and
none of the guiding lights have a
concrete objection, but when it;
comes to voting, they still say nix.,

CONFERENCE MEET
SHOULD BE REVIVED

There is no apparent reason —ex-
cept finances—why the once-annual
Pacific Coast Conference track meet
Wat discontinued back in 1926. Fur
thermore, there is no reason why
the meet could not be revived and
become one of the big athletic class
ics of the country.
Il won't be this year; the sched
ule's are already made up, and. con
ference officials would not do any
thing so hurriedly as to begin talk
of a May event as late as Febru
ary.
But the coast-wide competition
on the cinder path is the athle(ic
event that would cement the con
ference's ragged edges firmly to
gether again, and it should become
an actuality, if not this year, per
haps in 1 !);{(>.
The financial czars of the ten
member schools object, from pe
cuniary reasons, so perhaps it
would be well to weigh a bit of the
factors for and against. Opposed to
the meet are certain facts:

MEET WON'T BE
SELF-SUPPORTING

1. The cost. The meet could not
hope entirely to support the trav
elling expenses of teams from all
parts of the conference. Each school
would have to put up a certain
amount 1o send its athletes. No mat
ter how large an attendance the af l
fair drew, it could not hope to be
more than half-way self-sustaining.
2. The time. A mutual agree
ment would he difficult to reach,
since the four southern schools
will insist that it he prior to May
18, the time of the I.C. 4-A. The
northerners, on the other hand,
claim that a date th,*\t early
would not give them a chance to
prepare for the competition, since
weather does not permit them to
get outdoors until spring is well
along.
3. The dominance of southern
schools in track. The smaller mem
bers of the conference could not
hope to win a team title, and hence
they oppose negotiations.
All of these points, however, ex
cept possibly the financial one, can
b" argued down to insignificance.
In the first place, were the meet
held in some population center, it
could be counted on for a good
crowd. Either San Francisco or Los
Angeles newspapers would be anx
ious to give it the proper ballyhoo,
and it would involve enough out
standing athletes to give it a na
tional importance that naturally
would draw as good a track crowd
as any sectional gathering in the j
country.
