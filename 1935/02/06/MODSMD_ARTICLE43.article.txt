# NEILS LARSEN OUT FOR RUGBY; TEAM TO PLAY CLUBMEN
## Lewis, Wyman, Merritt, and Peters Outstanding 
### Warren Breed 
Neils Larsen, another football
player, came out for rugby practice
yesterday, and held down a forward
position right off the bat. A little
j experience with the intricacies of
i the rugger game and Larsen will be
! ;â€¢ valuable asset, for he is fast and
j packs plenty of weight.
Coach Harry Maloney is getting
ready for a hard game Saturday
| against the Olympic Club, and Lur
i sen's help will be invaluable agains r .
j the experienced clubmen.
Alustiza May Play
The probabilities are that Frank
Alustiza will play Saturday. The owl
j eyed Basque is handicapped, how
; by working hours and is only
| able to get out for practice twice a
| week. In his absence Bob Mondavi
I plays fullback, and has been show
' ing up well in daily workouts and
games.
As the team is not yet fully ac
quainted with the rules, regulations
and penalties, Coach Jim Wylie fre
quently stops the whole proceedings
and explains some ticklish point. He
is helped in this instruction method
by Captain Roger Hager, who has
been refereeing of late, and Coach
Harry Maloney.
Lewis As Instructor
Ray Lewis also does a bit of in
structing on the side, for he knows
as much as any of the players about
the game, and is probably the most
heady and finished player on the
squad. He is particularly adept at
the cross-kick, an important phase
of the game.
In the workout yesterday George
Wyman looked good from his rear
rank post. John Merritt and Jerry
Peters are also coming along in
their first year of the game. Merritt
has scored frequently in games,
often grabbing the ball in a goal
line rush and hurtling across the
line.
