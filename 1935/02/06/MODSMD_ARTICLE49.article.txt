## 
### 
The frosh baseball team yesterday
defeated the Menlo J. C. squad 5 to 0
iii a game featuring air-tight ball on
the part of the frosh. Menlo errored
heavily and their loss was due larg
ely to their errors.
Until the last of the fourth inning
the score was 1 to 0, but the frosh
collected two in the fourth and two
in the fifth to bring the total to five.
"Spike" Furman pitched the en
tire game for the frosh, allowing but
one hit, and striking out eleven men.
The infield composed of Russel Mc-
Kinney, first base; Paul Helms, sec
ond base; Jack Huddleson, third
base; and Charles Reimer, short
stop, functioned perfectly, while the
outfield composed of Frank Barsoc
chini, Tom Killefer, and Bill Boyd
did equally well. Glenn Hamilton
caught and showed much improve
ment over his previous games.
The next scheduled game is Sat
urday morning against Alameda
High School on the Indians' dia
mond.
