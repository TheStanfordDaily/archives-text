# TRACK TEAM SEES CHANCE TO REPEAT NATIONAL HONORS
## Four Men Remain From Last Year's Team 
### Phil Duffy 
With the announcement that the
i N.C.A.A. track meet would be held
in Berkeley this June, Stanford's
; hopes for a championship track team
j are taking on a more realistic form.
Tho,re is but little possibility that
the Cards will be unable to attend,
and with this meet so close at home,
I there is also the possibility that
; Dink Templeton will be able to take
j a team to the 1.C.4A meet. Stanford's
I seven-man team won this meet last
j year.
Four Men Back
The Farm men also annexed the
j N.C.A.A. title in Los Angeles with
j a total of 63 points. Last season a
| team composed of Sam Klopstock,
| Johnny Mottram, Chuck Nimmo, A1
Blackman, John Lyman, Gordon
j Dunn, Jim Wilson, and Bud Deacon
[ brought this victory to Stanford, de
! l'eating the favored teams of Loui
■ siana State and U.S.C.
Of this team only Klopstock, Mot
\ tram, Blackman, and Nimmo are on
, the present varsity. These four will
; be the nucleus for Stanford's team
I in the national meet and with the
' addition of Phil Levy in the discus,
,! Jim Reynolds in the shot, Chuck
' | Voight in the sprints, and Humbert
| Smith in the high jump, the Cards
will again have an eight-man team
capable of winning the champion
ship.
Klopstock Only Winner
Klopstock was the only member of
; the present track team to take a first
| place in the 1934 N.C.A.A., winning
! the 120 high hurdles. Mottram
j placed second in the javelin and
Nimmo sixth in the mile. Blackman
failed to qualify.
Warren Dixon, transfer from San
j Mateo Junior College, is another of
' the '35 eindermen who had great
! possibilities of making the N.C.A.A.
i team. He has done 4:23.0 in the mile
' and probably will do better this
! year. Mottram has already thrown
j the spear 203 feet, Voigt has done
I :9.8 seconds in the century, Smith
j leaped six feet four inches in the
; high jump, and Levy has tossed the
! discuss 153 feet.
i With such early season marks
| Templeton should be assured of a
; track team well representative of
Stanford's long standing principle
of turning out good track teams.
These men already mentioned have
the best marks to date, but there are
j numerous others now practicing
who will probably develop into
i champion material by the time of
\ ihe national meet.

Warren Dixon, transfer from San
j Mateo Junior College, is another of
' the '35 eindermen who had great
! possibilities of making the N.C.A.A.
i team. He has done 4:23.0 in the mile
' and probably will do better this
! year. Mottram has already thrown
j the spear 203 feet, Voigt has done
I :9.8 seconds in the century, Smith
j leaped six feet four inches in the
; high jump, and Levy has tossed the
! discuss 153 feet.
i With such early season marks
| Templeton should be assured of a
; track team well representative of
Stanford's long standing principle
of turning out good track teams.
These men already mentioned have
the best marks to date, but there are
j numerous others now practicing
who will probably develop into
i champion material by the time of
\ ihe national meet.
With the announcement that the
i N.C.A.A. track meet would be held
in Berkeley this June, Stanford's
; hopes for a championship track team
j are taking on a more realistic form.
Tho,re is but little possibility that
the Cards will be unable to attend,
and with this meet so close at home,
I there is also the possibility that
; Dink Templeton will be able to take
j a team to the 1.C.4A meet. Stanford's
I seven-man team won this meet last
j year.
Four Men Back
The Farm men also annexed the
j N.C.A.A. title in Los Angeles with
j a total of 63 points. Last season a
| team composed of Sam Klopstock,
| Johnny Mottram, Chuck Nimmo, A1
Blackman, John Lyman, Gordon
j Dunn, Jim Wilson, and Bud Deacon
[ brought this victory to Stanford, de
! l'eating the favored teams of Loui
■ siana State and U.S.C.
Of this team only Klopstock, Mot
\ tram, Blackman, and Nimmo are on
, the present varsity. These four will
; be the nucleus for Stanford's team
I in the national meet and with the
' addition of Phil Levy in the discus,
,! Jim Reynolds in the shot, Chuck
' | Voight in the sprints, and Humbert
| Smith in the high jump, the Cards
will again have an eight-man team
capable of winning the champion
ship.
Klopstock Only Winner
Klopstock was the only member of
; the present track team to take a first
| place in the 1934 N.C.A.A., winning
! the 120 high hurdles. Mottram
j placed second in the javelin and
