and a prize will be awarded to the

favorable comment from the alumni.
"The Illustrated went to press on
Monday," said Carol Green Wilson,
editor. "Mr. Wcigle's feature-writing
class co-operated in submitting
stories for this issue."
Deserving of special comment, in
the opinion of the editor, is an ar
ticle entitled "Ringing Stanford His
tory" by Gordon Steedman, Chap
paral editor-in-chief.
Other features include a debating
story by Bob Gros; a sports story by
Henry Jackson, Yale transfer; an ar
ticle on rugby by Harry Maloney;
and an expose of the technicalities
involved in drawing Mickey Mouse
by Jimmy Algar.
"Student interest in the magazine
should be at its peak this issue,"
Mrs. Wilson concluded.
