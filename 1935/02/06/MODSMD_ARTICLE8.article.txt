# GREEN TO TALK ON ENGINEERING
## Will Outline Available Jobs, Suggest Courses 
### 
Discussing "The School of Engi
neering," Boynton M. Green tonight
continues the Department Lecture
Series in the Little Theatre at 7:15
o'clock. Green, member of the
Lower Division and Vocational Guid
ance Committees, plans to outline
jobs actually available, and suggest
the best courses for prospective
engineers.
Dean Grayson Kefauver of the
School of Education will talk on
that department at the same time in
room 90.
Teaching and engineering ranked
third and fifth in a recent poll of
freshmen. Law and medicine led,
with business in fourth place as
most popular vocation.
Recent changes in the training
.program for teaching, and even
newer developments in the engi
neer's curriculum, make the talks
valuable to all majors or lowerclass
men behind-the-times in informa
tion about the two fields.
Dr. Gilbert C. Wrenn and Dr.
Harry J. Rathbun, vocational guid
ance committee members, will act
as chairmen of the meetings.
A special Thursday evening meet
ing has been scheduled for the
Women's Clubhouse at 7:30 o'clock
to supplement Dr. Kefauver's edu
cation lecture. Dr. Verna Carley and
Dr. Curtis Hand will discuss in full
the opportunities in the fields of
teaching administration and guid
ance.
All students may attend the sup
plementary meeting, which is plan
ned for those particularly interested
in education work, but should first
hear Dr. Kefauver's talk Wednes
day.
