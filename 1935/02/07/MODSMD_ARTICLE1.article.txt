### 
Fifty cents for a th&usand laughs!
That and one of the "ten best
plays" are offered theatre-going
Stanford people tomorrow night.
Excellent seats for tomorrow
night's showing of "Her Master's
Voice" are still on sale at the
A.S.S.U. offices in the Old Union at
the nominal prices of 50 cents to
one dollar, in spite of pretentious
scenes, elaborate props, and prob
ably the most novel array of sound
effects ever presented in a Stanford
play.
Sounds Prove Problem
Off-stage noises, says Technical
Director George Andreini, were a
difficult problem. How could the
stage crew produce the pop of a
champagne cork loud enough for
the entire audience to hear?
Prop managers O'ied pulling the
cork out of a soda bottle, unsuccess
fully. The sound was practically in
audible. A pop, gun explosion proved
to be loud and startling, but the
newest freshman would not have
mistaken it'for a champagne bottle.
The solution appeared in the per
son of Phil Brown, who will play
the part of the off-stage champagne
cork by the simple device of with
drawing a forefinger from his mouth
at. the crucial moment.
As the curtain rises, Kay Coni
ne's song is interrupted by a
crash of breaking china. Old
Union cups were provided to sup
ply the crash. Union nips, how
ever, are made of sturdier mater
ial than the prop managers
guessed — they failed to break
when merely slammed to the
floor. In tomorrow's showing they
will be stacked one on top of
the other, and hit by a brawny ;
member of the stage crew with i
a sledge hammer.
A real radio, complete with sound |
effects, will be furnished by the :
A.S.S.U. public address system, j
used this year to amplify citizen- •
ship lectures.
Copp Substitutes
The sound of a Duesenberg start
ing and stopping, hoped the staff,
could be found on a phonograph |
record of sound effects. Ready-made j
noises of thunder, cows mooing, j
waterfalls, etc., may be purchased, J
but a Duesenberg could not.
"That one was simple," boasted
Manager Andreini. "AH we have to '
do is get Jim Copp back stage—he'll ;
pass for anything."

guessed — they failed to break

Fifty cents for a th&usand laughs!
That and one of the "ten best
plays" are offered theatre-going
Stanford people tomorrow night.
Excellent seats for tomorrow
night's showing of "Her Master's
Voice" are still on sale at the
A.S.S.U. offices in the Old Union at
the nominal prices of 50 cents to
one dollar, in spite of pretentious
scenes, elaborate props, and prob
ably the most novel array of sound
effects ever presented in a Stanford
play.
Sounds Prove Problem
Off-stage noises, says Technical
Director George Andreini, were a
difficult problem. How could the
stage crew produce the pop of a
champagne cork loud enough for
the entire audience to hear?
Prop managers O'ied pulling the
cork out of a soda bottle, unsuccess
fully. The sound was practically in
audible. A pop, gun explosion proved
to be loud and startling, but the
newest freshman would not have
mistaken it'for a champagne bottle.
The solution appeared in the per
son of Phil Brown, who will play
the part of the off-stage champagne
cork by the simple device of with
drawing a forefinger from his mouth
at. the crucial moment.
