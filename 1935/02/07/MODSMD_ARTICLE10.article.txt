### 
FLEMINGTON, N. J., Feb. 6 (/P)
—Testimony intended to further
link the dead Isador Fisch with the
Lindbergh baby ransom cash and to
show that the maker's fingerprints
should have shown on the kidnap
ladder for six months marked Bruno
Richard Hauptmann's closing case
today.
Dr. Erastus M. Hudson, New York
fingerprint expert, whose silver ni
trate process was demonstrated to
the New Jersey State Police three
weeks after the kidnaping, which
took place March 1, 1932, swore
today his method would reveal
prints in the wood six months after
they were made.
The expert quality of the physi
cian's testimony was regarded as
the most effective blow to the
State's case against H-uiptmann
as the builder of the ladder, the
kidnaper and the collector of the
$50,000 ransom.
The defense also insinuated
strongly that the authorities had
made nail holes in one of the ladder
uprights to match those in the beam
in the attic of Hauptmann's home
from which, the stale charges, a
piece of board was taken to be used
in the ladder.
Dr. Hudson testified that when he
examined the ladder in March, 19.'>2,
h..> noticed only one, and no) the four
nail holes which now appear on the
upright.
