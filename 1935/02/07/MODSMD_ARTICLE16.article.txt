# F.D.R. BACKERS DEFEAT EFFORT 10 ADOPT DOLE
## Senate Committee Kills Bill To Cut Relief Measure In Vote Deadlock 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. G (&).â€”By
one vote only, the Administration
today averted, at least temporarily,
an insurgent effort to transform its
$4,880,000,000 work relief bill into
ah outright $2,880,000,000 dole, but
even the rescue effort left the meas
ure still locked in a none too sym
pathetic committee.
The proposal to sla?h the bill al
most in half and permit the use of
what was left to continue direct re
lief. if successful, would have made
impossible Mr. Roosevelt's program
of changing from charity to work.
Knees Tremble
The Senate Appropriations Com
mittee finally voted down the latest
rebellion by a 10 to 10 vote. First,
however, the knees of presidential
supporters were set to trembling by
a 9 to 8 vote for the dole.
Senators Adams of Colorado and
Copeland of New York, Democrats,
made plans, however, to resume
their attempt to scuttle the Adminis
tration's bill when the Appropria
tions Committee reassembles to
morrow.
If they fail to get the substitute
adopted they intend to take the issue
to the Senate floor.
Seek Support
But tonight uneasy Administra
tion adherents led by Senator
Byrnes (D., S.C.) were busy drum
ming up support for the full sum.
Friends of the bill asserted they
had no fear the Roosevelt plan
would be defeated in the Senate.
There was no dissent in the com
mittee today over adopting recom
mendations of the Democrats elimi
nating broad powers given the
President. The group retained in
tact his discretionary authority to
use the $4,880,000,000 for relief.
