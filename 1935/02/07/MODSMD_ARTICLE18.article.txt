# Fingers Nice To Have; Many Prefer 100 Grand
## 
### KLASINE VAN DER SLUIS 
Would you sell your utile finger '
for $100,000 in cold cash? It would !
seem lhat the average Stanford stu
' dent is of a mercenary nature, thinks !
! nothing of the lessened beauty of
j the hand minus the little finger, and j
would gladly part with that member
for such a generous sum. There are
| several pronounced exceptions to
| every rule, of course.
I In a non-discriminating question
<amp\ign to determine the whys
I and wherefores of the situation,
there were 44 affirmative replies as
| against 15 negatives, the latter
coming mainly from indignant
members of the pulchritudinous
sex.
Jimmy Triolo over the phone took
a minute for thoughtful reflection J
and then, "For a hundred grand, eh? .
Let me see, it wouldn't hamper my '
hashing capacity, and I could stiU— j
fight, Yes, I'll let you have the left
one. "Hey, who is this?"
Frank Alustiza, totally unprepared
i for the attack, queried haughtily, |
| "Pardon me?" And when he under- )
stood, "Most assuredly. I'd spend I

' the money navmg one good time.
Helen Ray felt differently. The
I student body vice-president an
swered with conviction, "No, I
should say not. I have a particular
fondness for my anatomy!"
While Professor Richard T. La
Pierre shouted indignantly, "That
i sounds like a conundrum to me! I
have absolutely no interest in it."
Gordon Steedman was of the opin
! icn that all people who go around
j asking such foolish questions should
have their little fingers chopped off,
which is probably more true than
(otherwise. Dave MellinkofT couldn't
seem to make up his mind—first it
, was "No," and, on second thought,
j "Yes."
Other replies were: "No. hut I'll
J sell my little toe cheap." "Yes, and
I'd go to Africa with the proceeds."
"There's very little I wouldn't sell
for 8100.000. gal." "How could I
do my sewing?" (This from a
j member of the stronger sex),
j "Hey—! What's the big idea, any
how? And who's going to put up
the dough, I'd like to know?"
I And wouldn't we all?
