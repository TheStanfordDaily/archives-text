### 
Experimenting with another institution for it.s system of student body
government, Farm political circles will receive their first official vocal
recognition this evening when the 23 nominees for three Ex Committee
positions give short platform speeches, as required by the newly-found
, ‚ùñprovision of the A.S.S.U. Consti-

tution.
Although the tentative arrange
ments announced Tuesday indi
cated otherwise, definite arrange
ments made yesterday fixed the
location at room 214 in the Eng
lish corner from 7 to 7:30 o'clock
in the evining.
Chairman of the political assem
bly will be Bill Rogers, member
at large of the Ex Committe and
one of the most, enthusiastic backer:;
of the idea when reviewed by the
committee last Tuesday night.
30 Minute Assembly
University authorities yesterday
were able to give the assembly but
30 minutes due to conflict with pre
viously scheduled programs. As a
result, Rogers is asking the candi
dates to keep their talks to a maxi
mum of one minute, merely out
lining briefly their qualifications and
platform.
As provided in the constitution,
candidates for the Ex Committee
offices, for graduate member, junior
man, and sophomore woman, will
automatically be declared ineligible
if they fail to appear at the assem
bly. Blanks for other declinations
will be available at the law steps
today, and must be filed before 5
o'clock.
The political inertia of Tues
day, when only five nominations
were filed, yesterday gave way to
vigorous activity as forty-five ad
ditional names were placed on the
ballot.
May Posts Nominated
Far from a lack of interest, en
thusiasm not only provided abun
dant candidates for the ten offices
to be filled but overflowed to the
extent that nominations were filled
for the secretary-treasury posts for
both the freshman and sophomore
classes, offices not to be filled until
the May elections.
However, a legal difficulty ap
peared when only one man, Bob
Gros, was nominated for the long
term Men's Council, while two po
sitions are open. Although confer
ring today with Dean Marian R.
Kirk wood of the law school in order
to avoid possible legal technicalities,
Chairman of the Election Board
John Bioek believes that the other
post can be filled by write-in can
didates.
Final word on the candidates for
assistant yell leader will not be re
ceived until tonight, pending the
settling of the scholastic difficulties
now making Bob Ranzoni ineligible
for office.
