# Mr. Hearst Explains His Stand on Communism
## 
### 
lii Ihe adjoining columns are reprinted an
editorial I'roni the .January H> issue of the
Daily, and that which appeared below it in
the Hearst newspapers Tuesday of this week
in answer to it.
Mr. Hearst has clarified his stand a good
deal. He has been charged with claiming that
Communism is being taught in all the colleges,
and denies that charge.
He says, "It is naturally unobjectionable to
discuss Communism in the colleges," but ob
jects to the teaching of it.
You and 1, who seek to learn both sides oi
every argument, who want to know all about
Socialism, Fascism, Communism, and the
other isms, will agree that while we enjoy
discussion and enlightenment, we too object
l<> the preaching of any social or political doc
trine whatsoever in an educational institution.
That would not be education.
Yet, we still seek to learn. Mr. Hearst's
simile of teaching crime and preaching Com
munism is good—if Communism is bad in
itself. A proper study of the situation, with
complete knowledge of the facts, should prove
to the student per sc that this is true if so be
the facts.

It is important to consider, as Mr. Hearst
points out, that the chief menace of Commu
nistic propaganda lies in the possibility that
it may accomplish the destruction ol democ
racy and achieve the despotism of Fascism for
I hese United States.
II is important that we, the "younger gen
eration," should strive to learn the truth about
Communism, Fascism, and Socialism. We
should know their agreement or their conllict
with each other.
We should decide how we may best pre
serve the liberty that American citizens main
lain it is their right to enjoy.

There is one more point which Mr. Hearst
might clarify that would set very many minds
at ease.
Many intelligent, fair-minded, educated
professors in our colleges today have been
seriously misled and in some cases cowed by
anti-Communistie propaganda.
The publicity in the metropolitan press has
been such as to drive fear into the heart of
even the faculty member who might other
wise discuss the situation with his students
when thru are merely see kin;/ information.
That I'ear is because they somehow believe
that they may be misquoted in the metropoli
tan press regardless of what they say.
That fear should he dispelled.
Mr. Hearst says that he believes in educat
ing the public in the facts of a ease. He be
lieves in the freedom of discussion even for
Communism.
Mr. Hearst is sincere in that statement and
knows that many a professor who is as fully
American as he is will still discuss other phi
losophies with his students in order to get at
the truth. Mr. Hearst opposes only those who
preach other doctrines, not those who discuss
them.
A declaration to this effect would help pre
sent a calamity which is very near the fear
of interference with academic freedom.
