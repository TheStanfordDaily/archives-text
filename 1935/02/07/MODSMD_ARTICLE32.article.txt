# Listen to 'Em Spiel Tonight
## 
### 
Tucked :i\vay in an obscure corner of the
revised A.S.S.U. Constitution adopted last
spring was a clause which obliges all candi
dates for election to the Executive Committee
to appear together at a public meeting before
election day, and explain to such a portion of
the student body as deigns to listen to them,
jtisl why they arc titled to be members of the
committee.
Tonight in Hoom 21 I the candidates must
undergo that ceremony. Whether it is a wise
requirement or not, no one knows, but for the
present, at least, we are here to learn.
Students will be doing themselves and the
candidates a favor by gathering around to
night to test the plan out.
Room 214, at 7:.'{() o'clock.
