Since 1922 Congress hat; been an inveterate whit
tier. It kept whittling away at thelunds which paid the
United States Army until it was narrowed down from
218,000 men and officers to 192,000, two thirds of the
former number.
Now Congress has laid down its whittling knife
and is on the verge of gluing back some of the shavings.
Last Tuesday the House Military Committee, after
hearing Chief of Staff MacArlhur outline a $405,000,000
program to modernize and restaff the army, recom
mended enactment of a measure to add 50,000 men
and 400 officers to the military forces.
Colonel Cubbison, professor of military science and
tactics, reveals that the House Military Committee in
the past has always been the highest hurdle in getting
military legislation through Congress and so feels
confident that Mac Arthur's proposal will go through.
"The national defense law of 1920," said Colonel
Cubbison, "was drawn up when war memories were
still vivid. A committee of leading civilians and officers
who had seen action met to draw up the act which
would determine the military policy of the country—
the first definite military policy the United States ever
had. #
"After much deliberation it was decided that the
absolute minimum of the army should be 200,000 men
and 18,000 officers. It was also decided to maintain a
strong national guard of 400,000 men as a reserve and a
large corp of commissioned officers for an emergency.
The purpose of the R.O.T.C. is to maintain this staff
of commissioned officers.
"Every time Congress whittled funds, the army
chiefs have warned that the national defense is get
ting below the danger point. It is rfreshing to see that
the whittling has stopped."
Colonel Cubbison points out that the U. S. ranks
sixteenth in point of numbers. But this country's army,
with the possible exception of England, has the highest
cost of maintenance per man. Yankee soldiers get $20
a month besides clothing, food and quarters. Most
countries have compusory military service and pay
their soldiers little or nothing.
If the Mac Arthur proposal goes through, the added
<50,000 men will probably be used to bolster the ranks
of the many "skeleton" regiments throughout the
country. The approximate cost has been estimated at
$25,000,000 a year—a small sum to pay for hiring half
a million men permanently compared with the vast
appropriations for temporary relief which are being
made.
"In hard times," Colonel Cubbison points out, "the
personnel of the army is always good. Recruiting
officers can choose from many arid be almost sure of
getting almost all high school graduates and a sprink
ling of college graduates.
"I am very glad to see this army improvement bill
before Congress. After all, to maintain the minimum
standard of our army is our only reasonable insurance.'
