# Strike in San Francisco
## 
### JOHN McCLELLAND, '37 
President Roosevelt proved, to be the belated man
on horseback in the longshoremen's strike. On June 26
he appointed the National Longshoremen's Board, con
sisting of Rev. Edward J. Hana, O. K. Cushing, and
Edward F. McGrady, whose authority as arbitrators
was accepted by the strikers in July by a vote of
approximately 6 to 1.
But it was a long time between June 26 and July 31
when everyone was back at work. A general strike
broke out and raged for days in the bay region. The
National Guard was called out. Police and strikers
fought with missiles, guns, and tear gas. On July 6,
the day of the famous "Battle on Rincon Hill," two
strikers were killed on the corner of Stuart and Mission
streets. Fifteen thousand turned out for their funeral.
Riots occurred in other ports. The labor revolt became
a labor war.
Peace came gradually. Strikers and employers
alike became tired of the long vigil, public opinion
favored settlement, and at the end of July all pick
eting and violence definitely came to an end and
the men went back to work on the understanding
that they and the employers were to accept the
decision of the Longshoremen's Board, whatever
it might he.
The arbitrators* award in brief provided for a
30-hour week with wages varying from a minimum
of 95 cents an hour to $1.40 an hour for overtime,
hiring halls to be maintained jointly by I.L.A.
and employers' associations.
The board also appointed a labor relations com
mittee in each port to settle all disputes that should
come up between longshoremen and employers. These
boards consist of three labor and three employer rep
resentatives. After continual deadlocks in San Fian
cisco, a third and impartial representative was ap
pointed. He is Judge Marcus Sloss, a man who formerly
knew nothing of longshore work. He acts as a jury.
The other six men are little more than attorneys.
But although there is actual peace at present, neither
side is going to be caught napping if trouble does
break out. Each faction watches the oth£r assiduously.
Watchtower for the employers is the notorious "F ink '
hall, called the Marine Service Bureau, which is under
the strong-arm supervision of strike-breaker "Betty
Jane" Ed Bettencourt, ex-Oakland cop. He has agents
provocateurs—spies —in the ranks of the 1.L.A., and
knows every move of the unions. These spies could be
used to stir up strikes at the will of the employers if
this group wished to gain ends by having the other
side cause trouble and go blame-free themselves.
Fink H'll is little less than an arsenal. Lockers
line the walls filled with sawed-o(I shotguns. Billy
clubs lie in profusion under the counters —always
within reach. The hall was an object of attack dur
ing the strike; bullets can he picked out of the
wall. That the title of "Marine Service Bureau"
is just a cover-up is seen in the fact that there
are nine men employed and in a recent month 150
Filipino somen was the sum total of men handled
through the bureau.
Strong-arm head of the labor faction is the no
torious Harry Bridges, president of the San Francisco
local of the 1.L.A., illegally holding ofTic because he is
an alien. The Longshoremen's Board, almost ready <o
dissolve, will probably not do so because of Bridges'
hinted threat that he will "keep them busy until
September."
Slack season now is coming to coast shipping, and
the marine workers are beginning to grumble. It is
getting so that union men will absolutely not work with
non-union men, "dirty ftnk.s," as they call them.
Innumerable minor strikes are called every month.
These one or two-day walkouts cost the employers
thousands of dollars, and naturally they protest.
Only last Monday, T. Ci. Plant, president of the
Waterfront Employers' Union, got the Department
of Labor in Washington excited when he called
them on the phone and cried on their shoulders
with: "Physical violence has been used and strikes
have been called against companies adhering to
the arbitration award. We are afraid of ,•mother
disastrous tie-up. Tell the I.L.A. to observe the
provisions of the award!"
How can it be said that permanent peace is
achieved?
