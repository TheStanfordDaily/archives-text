# The 						following editorial is reprinted from the Hearst newspapers of February 5, 1935:
## A 						Red Fire Alarm 
### 
Mr. Beaubaire writes an excellent editorial and his statement of fact 1
is quite correct us far as it goes, but it does not quite go to the heart of
the matter which is actually under discussion.
Nowhere is it claimed that principles subversive of the peace and
welfare of the United States are being taught in ALL the colleges—bul
merely that they are being taught in SOME of the colleges.
To use Mr. Beaubaire's simile of the fire—when a man's house is
observed to be on fire, there is no need that ALL THE ROOMS OF THr.
HOUSE should be aflame to justify an alarm. The fire may be in the parlor
or in one bedroom or only in the attic.
Still if attention is not called to the fire and the fire engines are not
summoned, the whole house may soon be on fire and be utterly destroyed. ,
A citizen who should discover a fire in one room of a neighbor's house
and should wait until the fire had spread to ALL the rooms before calling
attention to the situation would be a bad neighbor and a bad citizen.
By the time the fire had reached all the rooms or even a majority
of the rooms there would be no use to turn in an alarm. The fire would be
out of control. The alarm would be too late.
The Hearst papers have sounded an alarm concerning the teachings of
Communism APPROVINGLY in SOME colleges—not in all.
* * i» *
Communism as practiced in Russia—the only nation of importance
in which it prevails—is a policy of force and violence, of robbery and
rapine. _ I
Violence as a basic Communistic policy is promulgated by the authori
tative Kommintern of the Communist Internationale which declares:
"We proclaim openly that our design can ONLY be realized by the
VIOLENT overthrow of the ENTIRE traditional sochl order."
Communistic policy and practice as demonstrated in the efforts of
Communists to gain control of government in France, Italy, Germany,
Spain and other countries are based on terrorism and ruthlessness.
They are nothing less than the "frightfulness" of war applied to the
politics of peace.
It is impossible to teach the actuality of Communism approvingly
without being disloyal to the policies and principles of our own country.
It is naturally unobjectionable to DISCUSS Communism in the
colleges.
It is unobjectionable to discuss crime, but it is incendiary to TEACH
CRIME.
The difference is obvious.

! Many college professors are purely theorists. They are visionaries.
They have had very little practical experience in the world. They often
had very little practical experience in the world. They often teach alluring
theories which are wholly impractical and sometimes dangerous in
operati<?Vi. j
Mr. Brisbane says that it takes a good mind to resist education—
meaning to resist accepting blindly ALL that is taught in the schools —to
discriminate between what is valuable and what visionary.
The first few years of a man's life after graduation from college are j
frequently spent in unlearning much that he learned in college.
Those who went to college fifty years ago were all taught the free j
trade theories of Cobden and Mill. The graduates came out of college free 1
traders only soon to be transformed by the actualities of economics into '
protectionists.

What young people and old people, too, ought to know today is the i
actualities of Communism—the practical or rather the impractical opera- ;
tion of it; the hideous failure of it —the fact that it has been tried a,
thousand times in the history of the human race and has always been j
a failure.
Communism is only adaptable to a primitive and impoverished com- |
munity and it can be counted upon to keep the community primitive and
impoverished.
These actualities of Communism the Hearst papers are presenting ,
continually to their readers.
These actualities are damning, and by them Communism is doomed, j
Just as free trade has disappeared as a practicable policy even in i
England, so, in a few years, Communism will inevitably disappear as a .
practicality even in Russia.
The serious aspect of Communistic agitation in this country is not
that it can accomplish the success of Communism, but that it may
accomplish the destruction of democracy.
The despotism of Fascism is frequently raised up to combat the |
despotism of Communism.
Then liberty and democracy, crushed between the upper and nether |
millstones, are ground to dust and dissolution.
In the light of history it would certainly seem that liberty is the most !
precious possession of mankind and that we Americans possessing liberty |
should exert the eternal vigilance which is necessary to preserve it.

What young people and old people, too, ought to know today is the i
actualities of Communism—the practical or rather the impractical opera- ;
tion of it; the hideous failure of it —the fact that it has been tried a,
thousand times in the history of the human race and has always been j
a failure.
Communism is only adaptable to a primitive and impoverished com- |
munity and it can be counted upon to keep the community primitive and
impoverished.
These actualities of Communism the Hearst papers are presenting ,
continually to their readers.
These actualities are damning, and by them Communism is doomed, j
Just as free trade has disappeared as a practicable policy even in i
England, so, in a few years, Communism will inevitably disappear as a .
practicality even in Russia.
The serious aspect of Communistic agitation in this country is not
that it can accomplish the success of Communism, but that it may
accomplish the destruction of democracy.
The despotism of Fascism is frequently raised up to combat the |
despotism of Communism.
Then liberty and democracy, crushed between the upper and nether |
millstones, are ground to dust and dissolution.
In the light of history it would certainly seem that liberty is the most !
precious possession of mankind and that we Americans possessing liberty |
should exert the eternal vigilance which is necessary to preserve it.

Mr. Beaubaire writes an excellent editorial and his statement of fact 1
is quite correct us far as it goes, but it does not quite go to the heart of
the matter which is actually under discussion.
Nowhere is it claimed that principles subversive of the peace and
welfare of the United States are being taught in ALL the colleges—bul
merely that they are being taught in SOME of the colleges.
To use Mr. Beaubaire's simile of the fire—when a man's house is
observed to be on fire, there is no need that ALL THE ROOMS OF THr.
HOUSE should be aflame to justify an alarm. The fire may be in the parlor
or in one bedroom or only in the attic.
Still if attention is not called to the fire and the fire engines are not
summoned, the whole house may soon be on fire and be utterly destroyed. ,
A citizen who should discover a fire in one room of a neighbor's house
and should wait until the fire had spread to ALL the rooms before calling
attention to the situation would be a bad neighbor and a bad citizen.
By the time the fire had reached all the rooms or even a majority
of the rooms there would be no use to turn in an alarm. The fire would be
out of control. The alarm would be too late.
The Hearst papers have sounded an alarm concerning the teachings of
Communism APPROVINGLY in SOME colleges—not in all.

practicality even in Russia.
The serious aspect of Communistic agitation in this country is not
that it can accomplish the success of Communism, but that it may
accomplish the destruction of democracy.
The despotism of Fascism is frequently raised up to combat the |
despotism of Communism.
Then liberty and democracy, crushed between the upper and nether |
millstones, are ground to dust and dissolution.
In the light of history it would certainly seem that liberty is the most !
precious possession of mankind and that we Americans possessing liberty |
should exert the eternal vigilance which is necessary to preserve it.
