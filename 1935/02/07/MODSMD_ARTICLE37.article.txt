"SWEET ADELINE"
Al Stanford Theatre
Like artichoke without mayon
naise, like Mrs. F.D.R. without her
teeth, like Mae West devoid of sub
tlety, is a gay nineties story gone
highbrow. Those very individual,

distingu i s h i n g
qualities which
arose from its
fair and frank
estimate of life
are missing. In
their place we
have slushy
sent imentality,

which reaches its peak of putridity
when Adeline gets hysterical on
learning that New York's ace round
er, who has put a fortune in her
show, doesn't intend to marry her at
all! For the role of Adeline, the
Warners produced Irene Dunne. The
poor woman apparently finds it quite

difficult to appear lighthearted after
all the lovers she has sacrificed of
late, but she does do justice to the
many beautiful Jerome Kern melo
dies that come her way. Ned Sparks,
Hugh Herbert, and Joe Cawthorn,
the film's zanies, are left pretty much
to their own resources by a dull and
careless script. —Lowe
