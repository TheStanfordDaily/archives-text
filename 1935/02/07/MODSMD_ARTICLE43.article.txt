# Basketball Players Leave Tonight For Troy Doubleheader
## Bunn Pleased with Showing Against Dons; 13 Men To Make Trip 
### Phil Duffy 
Thirteen basketball players leave
tonight to resume relations with the
University of Southern California,
now leading the southern division of
Ihe Pacific Coast Conference with
five games won and one lost.
That one loss of the Trojans was
suffered when they met John Bunn's
men here several weeks ago. On
paper the Indians do not seem to
have a chance against the confer
ence leaders but the fact remains
that the Barry men always have
more trouble cracking the Stanford
defense than they have with any of
their other opponents.
Bunn Optimistic
Bunn, pleased by the Cards'
showing against the S.F.U. Dons,
looks forward to the week end with
great optimism. He feels that Stan
ford has a chance to take at least
one of the Troy games and possibly
both of them. A double victory for
the Redmen would put them back
into the running again.
The Stanfords' victory over the
U.S.F. five meant something to John
Bunn as it marked the first year
since he has coached the Cards that
Stanford has defeated the Little
Three, St. Mary's, Santa Clara, and
U.S.F., all in one season. Bunn was
highly pleased with the showing of
the Redshirts against the Hill
toppers.
He remarked that the Indian quin
tet was passing the ball so fast "that
half of the time the U.S.F. boys were
looking to see where it went."
Keith Topping began to look like
the center he was a couple seasons
ago and sank buckets from unbe
lievable angles. Topping likes to
play basketball in the southland and
will bolster the Indian attack against
Troy.

Coach Bunn.
Turner, Bost, Topping, Moore and
Lindsey will start the first game in
the Olympic Auditorium.
Thirteen basketball players leave
tonight to resume relations with the
University of Southern California,
now leading the southern division of
Ihe Pacific Coast Conference with
five games won and one lost.
That one loss of the Trojans was
suffered when they met John Bunn's
men here several weeks ago. On
paper the Indians do not seem to
have a chance against the confer
ence leaders but the fact remains
that the Barry men always have
more trouble cracking the Stanford
defense than they have with any of
their other opponents.
Bunn Optimistic
Bunn, pleased by the Cards'
showing against the S.F.U. Dons,
looks forward to the week end with
great optimism. He feels that Stan
ford has a chance to take at least
one of the Troy games and possibly
both of them. A double victory for
the Redmen would put them back
into the running again.
The Stanfords' victory over the
U.S.F. five meant something to John
Bunn as it marked the first year
since he has coached the Cards that
Stanford has defeated the Little
Three, St. Mary's, Santa Clara, and
U.S.F., all in one season. Bunn was
highly pleased with the showing of
the Redshirts against the Hill
toppers.
He remarked that the Indian quin
tet was passing the ball so fast "that
half of the time the U.S.F. boys were
looking to see where it went."
Keith Topping began to look like
the center he was a couple seasons
ago and sank buckets from unbe
lievable angles. Topping likes to
play basketball in the southland and
will bolster the Indian attack against
Troy.
Page in Lineup
A1 Page, Card guard, who has
been out for several days due to a
dislocated shoulder, joined the ranks
this week and saw action against the
Dons; he will be used against the
southern team. Don Greenlee, cen
ter, injured a bone in his back and
has been ordered to lay off for a
few days by the doctor. He will be
unable to make the trip but will be
in readiness next Monday.

Cowing, Anderson, Quade; centers,
Topping, Nobs, Bell; guards, Moore,
