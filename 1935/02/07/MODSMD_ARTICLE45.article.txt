# DANGER OF ACCIDENT FRIGHTENS OFFICIALS
## 
### 
In the» first place, they fear a
tragic accident. U.S.C. took up the
sport, and a student died following
a bout; so today Southern Califor
nia is not a member of the coast
association, and the incident almost
caused the group to be dissolved.
Secondly, the colleges worry
about unwholesome rivalries.
When members of rival fraterni
ties or clubs meet, with friends of
each backing him with both spirit
and coin, there may tend to be an
overdose of ferocity that would
be dangerous to the amateur
standing of the sport.
Above all, Glass pointed out, col
leges do not wish to train youths
to become professionals. The ar
ticle said that was the reason why
there is not a national intercolle
giate boxing championship, which
would be provided with a "fanfare
of publicity, and create a new set of
collegiate heroes who might be
tempted, aftei' graduation, to capi
talize on their college success."
Both Bobby Grayson and Lawson
Little are enrolled in journalism
courses. Little took a course last fall
in newswriting; it was understood
he had been signed to write a series
of articles for an eastern magazine.
