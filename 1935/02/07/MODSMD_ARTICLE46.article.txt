### IRVIN JORGENSEN 
In between the rainstorms, Stan
ford tennis men have been engaging
in combat with each other. Varsity
players are working out in prepa
lation for their first practice match
when they meet the Berkeley Tennis
Club February 10 in the Bay City.
This week end, Bill Seward will
Uam with Margaret Osborne of San
Francisco in an exhibition doubles
match against Gene Mako and Jessie
Ragener of Los Angeles as a part
of the Northern California indoor
tournament. The match, to be held
ai the Palace of Fine Arts in San
Francisco, will start at 7:30 o'clock
Saturday evening.
Though the first four men on the
ladder — Sam Lee, Seward, John
Law, and Jack Lynch — have re
mained in the same ladder positions
for the past few months, there have
beer several shillings from number
five on down.
Ben Dey was forestalled in a
four-set battle by Jack Lynch in a
challenge match for the fourth po
sition, but he maintained fifth place
by beating Bob Pommer. Pommer
defended his right to sixth place in
a recent set-to with Danny Clark,
emerging victor alter a torrid five
set match: 6-4, 2-6. 6-4, 3-6, 6-1.
Below Clark, Jack Downey, hero
of last year's U.S.C. series, keeps
eighth place, while Bob Lilienthal
and Bob Jones have advanced to
ninth and tenth position by virtue |

| of victories over Burnett Mason.
Little activity in the novice tour
nament has been seen since Don
Kennedy advanced into the semi
finals by winning from John Clifton, i
Kennedy is now waiting for the out- j
ccme of the quarter-final match be
tween Waldo Munday and Eliot ;
BJanchard.
