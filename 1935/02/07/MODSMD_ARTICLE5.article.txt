Boyn! on M. Green, member of the
vocational guidance committee.
Dr. Kefauver discussed chiefly
the qualifications necessary for suc

well developed ability for leader- j
ship, and a capacity for working j
with people, which will show itself I
in ah interesting and understanding
method of teaching a subject.
In regard to the training needed,
Dr. Kefauver says that the student
planning to enter this vocation
should not limit himself to one par
ticular branch in the field, but
should acquire a general knowledge
of other lines as well.
Green stressed the need for a
well-laid undergraduate foundation
for the large demand seen in the en
gineering field. Work in this field
requires the maximum of clcar
thought and analysis, with accurate
and precise work a necessity, he

dependability, imagination, and |
critical curiosity.
Great emphasis is laid upon labor- |
atory training and a thorough j
knowledge of physics, chemistry, and j
mathematics during the undergrad- I
