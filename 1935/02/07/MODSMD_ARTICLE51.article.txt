# Coach Guards Luisetti, Fixes Yearling Defense
## 
### GORDY FROST 
When basketball coaches John j
Bunn of the varsity and Jimmy
Bradshaw of the frosh disagreed;
yesterday morning on the best j
method to guard an offensive pivot
j man, they turned to actual practice j
j to decide the issue.
Bunn upheld the belief. that de
spite his shorter stature he could
guard a tall offensive center better
from behind than a taller man could J
guard that same center from in j
front. In both cases the pivot man j
was to play just inside the free i
, throw line.
Bunn Proves Theory
At yesterday afternoon's practice j
j session Bunn tested out his theory. I
j Lanky Hank Luisetti was put at the j
I pivot post and it became Bunn's |
j job to guard him successfully from
! behind while the tall frosh player |
I tried to ring up baskets. Although
; onlookers declared the varsity coach ,
i fouled Luisetti more often than nee- I
; essary, they agreed that Bunn was
\ quite successful in preventing scor-
I ing shots.
Then Dick Lyon, who equals Lui
setti in height, took the guarding po
' sition in front of his man but was ,
i unable to stop the fleet Luisetti.
J Both coaches finally agreed that!
Bunn's method was best.
Play U.S.F. Tomorrow
All this experimentation was by
way of developing the Card frosh'l
| defensive system to be used tomor- j

! iow night when the babes clash with
University of San Franciseho fresh
j men at 7:30 o'clock in the Pavilion.
! The U.S.F. quintet is reported to
i lack strength this season but has
j one threat in the person of forward
. Lyrahan.
Following the U.SF. game the
frosh will have only one practice
meeting before they encounter the
J California frosh for the second
I "Little Big Game" Tuesday night at
j Berkeley.
