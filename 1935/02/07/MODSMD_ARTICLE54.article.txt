# INDIANS, OLYMPICS TANGLE SATURDAY IN RUGBY CONTEST
## 
### 
A potentially strong rugby team
from Post Street's Olympic Club
will meet the strong Stamord fifteen
here Saturday afternoon.
At the same time S.C.'s squad from
the sunny south sets to work on the
California ruggers.
Much will be revealed in the way
of league championships, for all
four of the contending teams have
pennant aspirations, and one or two
may be eliminated from considera
tion.
It will be the first conference
game for Troy, so a loss will be a
severe setback. A California victory |
will also be of no little concern to
Stanford, for the Bears have already
beat most of the club teams in the !
Northern California loop, including
two wins over two title contenders,
U.C.L.A. and the Olympic Club. [
The club game will be no easy 1
pickings for the Cards, for at times
thus season the Post street boys have
shown flashes of experienced bril
liance.
The Stanford "A" team will prob
ably have Frank Almtiza, John
Reisner, Ray Lewis, Joe Vigna, Tony
Cocking, Jim Trompas, and Fred
Abbott in the secondary. The scrum
will be selected from Jack Walton, '
Jerry Peters, Dick Morrison, Dick
Becker, Jim Mullen, Frank Inger
soll, John Merrit, Marvin Taylor
John Wyman, Primo Pinotti, and
Captain Roger Hager.
The Card "B" team will have
their hands full in the preliminary,
meeting the S. F. Blues.
