# BULL SESSION
## INFERNO ON THE FARM 
### 
Cutting through the dead silence
, of early morning, the long mourn
i ful notes of the Firehouse whistle
slirred a sleeping campus. One long
blast, a pause, and then nine more:
| Encino was on fire.
I By the time the fire department
I could be roused into action, lower
| floor Encina crackled as a huge bon
'fiie. The central staircase was cut
| off: its four-story draft .sucked the
! rr.aring flames up to lick the base
|of the fifth floor. Side stairways
I were hopelessly hot. . Like small
I chimneys, they burned and smoked.
I Perhaps it was incendiarism; no one
j knew.
Down the back walls of Encina's
wings, frantic, screaming freshmen
attempted all at once to crowd down
i the two narrow fireladders. But the
, ladders were too few, and the frosh
I were too many, and too anxious.
' Heads were bashed; arms and legs
I : :

I broken: it was getting hut; they had
J "Lo get out. Now, as the flames
; reached the second, the third, and
1 the fourth floors, hundreds of fresh
! men — blinded with smoke, dizzy
with fear — knew that they were
trapped. From the windows they
leaped in desperation. Some landed
. luckily on (he front lawn; more fell
I dead or unconscious on the
, Pen cement, and the .surrounding
roads. The fire department was
; there, helpless against the giant fur
nace that was Encina.
I
i
As dawn broke, heaps of dead and
1 mangled bodies covered the ground
i Encina still smoked. The nation's
| press was aghast at the tragedy.
| someone would be held responsible,
j That did not help very much.
: Now that may all sound very
gruesome and very fanciful. And
I someone will say it has never hap
| pt-ned. But it can happen. The plain
i fact is that Encina Hall and the
! lives of 560 Farm students are not
j adequately protected against fire,
i The plain fact is that Encina Hall
| does not even fulfill the legal fire
i escape requirements that a city like
! Palo Alto demands. »
