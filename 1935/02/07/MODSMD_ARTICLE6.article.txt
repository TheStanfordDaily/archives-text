TOKYO, Feb. 6 (A } ) â€”Future Japa
rc ;e naval construction, Admiral
Mineo Minister of the Navy,
told a committee of the House of
Representatives today, will be phm
-1 ed "according to an independent
national policy."
"Some categories of the Japanese
navy," Osumi said, "probably will be
built up more than the other pow
ers, other categories less, according
to our own needs. I believe national
security can be achieved by build
ing about 50,000 tons a year."
Remarking that the Japanese
navy's current strength is about 80
per cent of that of the United States,
the naval minister indicated that
such a program would keep Japan'v
strength close to that of the United
States.
"But if tonnage is limited by new
treaties," he continued, "Japan must
have parity."
