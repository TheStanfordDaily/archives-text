It is good Encina fun to light fires
in waste baskets, and upset fire ex
i tinguishers. Encina boys are a happy
lot. and apparently uncontrollable.
Were it a class "A" fireproof build
ing, Encina, because of the nature
of its inmates, would be a bad fire
risk. But with wild freshmen, a rick
i ety building, and little fire protec
! tion, Encina becomes a first-class
house of death.
