# Aspiring Legislators Keep Political Rally In Gale of Laughter
## Committee Candidates loss Quips; Small Audience Appears for Meet 
### Irvin Jorgensen 
It may not have been the great
est .show on earth, and "Her Mas
ter's Voice" may ba the funniest,
but last night's political rally was a
great show; it was funny; and it
didn't cost money.
At least tiie small group that
gathered in room 214 to listen to
the wisecracks of Chairman Bill
Rogers, who impartially intro
duced the candidates running for
Ex Committee in next Tuesday's
election, and the wisecracks of
the candidates themselves, felt
sorry for the 3,500 students who
stayed away.
Holding a stop watch over the
candidates to be they did not
exceed their required time, Rogers
decided that the women candidates
were "faster" than the men, that de
spite the hilarity it was a valuable
political experiment. With both
opinions the audience seemed to
concur.
Upon one point all candidates
were agreed: they would be unbi
ased members of Ex Committee if
elected.
Short excerpts from the speeches
are: *
Tom Boothc: I have no platform,
but I think this job is important,
and I will fulfill it to the best of my
ability. (Said Rogers with his stop
watch: Tom, you did that in 11 sec
onds flat.)
Wally Brooke: Divorce The Daily
and Ex Committee, except for fi
nances.
Joe Burris: No matter who wraps
it up it still sells for 25 cents per
pound.
Phil Coghlan: I'd try to do best
for students as whole and do best
for group or groups.
Sterling Cotlreli: The five preced
ing men have stolen my speech.
Bill Drew: I have no platform, no
cigar, no derby.
John Harvey (apologizing for the
fact that he had not had time to
dress properly for the occasion): It
has been suggested that I run on
the labor party platform. (Said the
well-dressed Rogers: I guess that
makes me a Republican).
Jim Litd'am: Interested" in fur
thering the building of the New
Theatre.
John Slusscr: Ex Committe

ing such controversial matters as
The Daily.

reduced.

wider's platform, and with Mellin
koff and the right to boo. We should

one except poppa!)
