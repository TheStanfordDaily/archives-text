# HUMAN NATURE TOPIC OF TALK
## Dr. Woodbridge Tells Of .... Modern Philosophy .... 
### 
Genial, kindly Dr. Frederick J. E. >
Woodbridge opened his lecture on j
"Nature and Human Nature" in the j
i Little Theatre yesterday afternoon I
with an apology for a philosophic!
failing to sum up ages and epochs. |
The Greeks, he said, contested na- !
|
ture with art; to the Romans nature j
meant duty; in the Middle Ages na- !
ture was synonymous with God; I
nature is equal to human nature in j
our modern times.
Dr. Woodbridge, professor of phil
osophy at Columbia University, went
1 on to say that we look within our- !
selves for the key to human exist |
cnce. A kind of humanitarianism I
characterizes our life today. We are'
'morally shocked by such.things as |
poverty, disease, lack of opportunity,!
frustration, and failure.
Unless these ethics are translated j
into administration, they are beau
tiful, but not effective. We must edu-
I cate ourselves to distribute the
goods of life. First we must decide
what things will be useful, in edu
-1 cation for example, when distribu
ted. Then we must worry about what
can be distributed without loss.
Professor Woodbridge concluded his
informal talk with the statement
<hat his purpose had been to bring
us face to face with an understand
ing of the goods of life not in terms
of their desirability, but in terms of,
their distributability.
Professor Woodbridge is to deliver
the Howison lecture at the Univer
' sity of California today.
