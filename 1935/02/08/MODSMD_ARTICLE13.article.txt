# INDIANS FACING TOUGH TEST IN TROJAN SERIES
## Bunn's Men Battle League Leaders in Two-Game Meeting in South By Mort D'Evelyn 
### 
Facing tueir tirst big hurdle in a
j determined comeback, the Indian
quintet faces the Trojan five in Los
: Angeles tonight in the first of a two
j game series and the opening game of
the second half of the conference
1 season.
Last time the Indian faced the
j Trojan, some four weeks ago* it was
j the '"dark horse" against the favor-
I ites. The "dark horse" surprised and
I took one game, the only game the
U. S. C. hoopsters have lost during
the current conference season. To
night the Trojans are stiil favorites
! for the crown, and are firmly settled
■ on top of the ladder. The Cards arc
|in the cellar, and,
at least, are firmly secure.
| Since they hit the bottom, bow
ever, the long hoped for lias hap
pened. Since Coach John Bunn
1 brought his varsity back from the
Midwest trip early last month,
critics have maintained that al
Stanford needed was a center.
Last Saturday night Keith Topping
j recovered from the infections and
lacerations which ruined his first
! three weeks of play and fitted with
| enough smoothness into the de
fense and offense to permit the
I Cards to upset Santa Clara.
Again on Tuesday, with Topping
; showing even more steadiness and
i scoring ability at center, Stanford
won, this time over San Francisco
I University, another touted team.
I Apparently the center problem has
j been solved, and tonight will deter
] mine whether the expected strength
j is really there.
I While Stanford has been losing
every conference game, since their
defeat by the Cards a month ago,
the Tropans have been having
| their own way in conference play,
i winning two from both the Bruins
*uid the Bears without much dif
ficulty. Two wins over the Cards
will practically cinch the title for
! s.c.
Trojan followers for a while be
| moaned the loss of Captain "Bark
ing Joe" Kelly at guard, but sopho
j more Eddie Cram has more than
I filled the position. The rest of the
lineup will be unchanged, wilh Lee
Guttero, leading conference scorer,
at center, Jack Hupp and Ernie Hol
brook at forwards, and Hop Find
lay at the other guard position.
Starting for the Cards will be the
same five that opened against the
Broncos and the Dons—Howell Tur
ner and Rod Bost at forwards, Top
ping at center, and Robin Lindsey
and Dinty Moore at the guard posts.
