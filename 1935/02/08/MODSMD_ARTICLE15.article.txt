ng, February 11, from 9:30 to 10
('clock, representing the Stanford
jermanic Languages department
vhich is taking over next week's
New World Series" sponsored by
he California Teachers' Association. I
Professor Morgan will start by
)roadcasting a short talk: "German
n High Schools and the Universi- !
ies." "Foreign languages and their 1
itudy should serve international
*ood will and understanding in a
lew world," believes the head of the ;
jerman department. "Language is
he key to heart and soul of a nation.
Language Profitable
"The physician, the scientist, the !
educator, the student of history, lit
erature, and art and people engaged
n many other occupations will
jreatly profit by a knowledge of
Jerman. Such a knowledge pro
vides one of the keys to the cultural, !
political, commercial, and scientific j
ife of modern Europe.
"That there is a growing realiza- i
ion of this fact is clearly indicated
iy the rapid comeback that German
nas staged after the disappearance
if an understandable though regret -
able war - psychology of unhappy

memory."
Dr. Reinhardt. will discuss some
of the teaching techniques employed j
in German instruction. "It is true |
that scientific works can be rendered j
in foreign languages without major I
distortion of contents," states Dr. j
Reinhardt. "With philosophical and j
literary works the task becomes.
more difficult and frequently it is j
an impossible and hopeless under- j
taking.
Patriotism in Art
"What the Germans call 'Volks- (
geist' or 'national spirit' constitutes
a reality which can be compre
hended as it is manifest and incar
nate in works of art and literature,
but which cannot be translated or
transplanted.
"Therefore, those works that re
veal the heights and depths of na
tional feeling, workc that embody
the raptures and agonies of the na- '
tional spirit, works which therefore I
truly represent the foreign national j
culture â€” such works are strictly i
speaking untranslatable."
Dr. Morgan will sing two selec
tions: "Du bist wie cine Blume" by
Heine and Schumann, and "Heiden
roeslein" by Goethe and Schubert.
Orchestral selections by Bach, Bee
thoven, Strauss, and Brahms wili
conclude the program.
