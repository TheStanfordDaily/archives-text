## Demand Ban of American, British Strongholds

TOKYO, Feb. 7 (ff*) —The status of
j United States fortifications in Ha
, waii and of Great Britain's power
ful base at Singapore "should be re
j considered," Japan believes, in any
■ agreement affecting Pacific Ocean
j fortifications which may succeed
j the Washington naval treaty.
At. the same time she is convinced
restrictions should be lifted on the
chain of Japanese islands flung in a
huge arch along Ibe Asiatic coast.
Ask Treaty Revision
This version of the Japanese view
j point was outlined today by the ad
j jutant to Admiral Mineo Osumi in
j explanation of his statement yester
| day that it was questionable wheth
j er the provisions of article 19 of the
! Washington treaty (relating to Pa
cific fortifications) should remain in
'.force "without revision."
| The effect of the changes sug-
I'gested would be to "remove" the
j'naval bases, from which Great Bri
; tain or the United Slates might oper
-1 ate defensively, several hundred
j miles farther away from Japan's
! sphere of domination. (In other
I words, curtail or eliminate the bases
| in Hawaii and Singapore.)
This naturally would greatly
I strengthen Japan against Occidental
j interference in her oriental hege
mony.
Hawaii Important
"The extended range of all na
vies," the naval minister's aid said,
"makes desirable from the stand
point of all powers concerned that
the status of Hawaii and Singapore
should be reconsidered.
"Moreover, the Japanese navy
feels that expanding Chinese air
forces necessitate the removal of
present limitations on our right to
strengthen the defenses of Formosa
and the Pescadores, separated from
China by a narrow strait and a half
j hour's flight.
