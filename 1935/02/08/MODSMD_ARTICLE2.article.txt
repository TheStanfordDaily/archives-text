# Ballot List Reduced by Nine Names
## Still Accept Declinations Till Noon Today 
### 
While the finding of another "lost" i
clause in the constitution increased j
the period for filing formal declina- ,
tions until noon today, those re- j
ceived yesterday and two ineligi- j
bilities due to failure to appear at j
the assembly reduced the list of j
candidates for student body offices j
by nine.
Those declining included Jack L |
Gatman for graduate man; Ed P. |
Kehoe for junior man; Ruth Jean- j
cite Hancock for sophomore woman; i
Joyce Dunkerly and Dorothy Sweet j
for Women's Council; and Tom Col- |
bus and Henry Laws for Men's j
Council. Ed McKeon and Tom 1
Needham, both candidates for jun- j
ior man, failed to appear at last ;
night's assembly and were auto- i
matically crossed off the ballot.
Blanks at Law Steps
Blanks for further formal declina- j
tions will be available at the law I

steps. j
The legal difficulty surrounding \
the Men's Council election, only one ;
man being nominated for the two :
"long term" pests to be filled, was ;
settled last night by Dean Marion R. ;
Kirkwood of the Law School, ad- j
viser on the A.S.S.U. constitution.
Dean Kirkwood agreed that the sec- j
ond position may be filled by write- :
in candidates, and that two blanks
must be provided for that purpose.
