orchestra assembled especially for the show, it promises to outdo any
recent production at Stanford.

sides the traditional Hough tickets,
will be offered until sold out. If

This spicy drama roused guffaws
and amused admiration during its
last - year Broadway run. Slightly
risque situations were slated for
censorship before the campus pres
entation, until a compromise was
effected. The play remains itnact;
but, in the words of Dick Frank, in
one scene "now he sits on the foot of
the bed."
Pictures of characters in the
play have appeared in San Fran
cisco newspapers, creating a stir
among critics. Dramatic editors of
several papers have announced
their intention to attend the per
formance. Wood Soanes of the
Oakland Tribune wrote an espe
cially enthusiastic letter to Dick
| Frank, manager.
The curtain rises on the first elab
orate setâ€”the living room of the
Farrars house, Homewood, New
Jersey. The house is modest, but
tasteful, with a baby grand piano
i the only pretentious note.
Technical Director George Andre
; ini, with the aid of his Theatre
Workshop class, has painstakingly
constructed each item of scenery.
Act two shows the interior of a
palatial home, a sleeping porch with
up-to-date furniture and broad win
dows overlooking an expanse of
tree-bordered lawn.
Other odd It its of property were
assembled for last night's dress
rehearsal and include a sledge
hammer, fur coat, nine Union
cups, the A.S.S.U. amplifying sys
tem, Phil Bro\Vn, and one large
automobile.
Wilfiam Murray Timmons has di
rected the entire show. Casting was
begun before finals last quarter, and
a rigid rehearsal has enabled the
characters to reach a high peak of
efficiency.

Comrie, Queena Farrar; Annelies
