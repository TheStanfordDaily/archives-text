# Supreme Court And the Cold Decision
## 
### 
Nine American "wist- men" are about to an
nounce a decision which the world has been
eagerly awaiting quite some time. Slow as it
is. even the legal machinery of the courts of
the t'nited States eventually reaches some
conclusion.
The Supreme Court is asked to say defi
nitely whether or not the government of this
country Ikis the constitutional right to impair
contract rights, calling all gold out of circula
tion, thus making il impossible for debts call
ing for payment in gold coin to be "legally"
met.
There are nine intelligent American citi
zens on that court, fully aware of business
conditions and the effect that their decision
may have. They have studied the Constitu
tion, and have studied circumstances.
They are legal authorities, and are faced
with the proposition of being legally practical.
Or practically legal?
It j.s merely common sense that gold in the
\ mied States Treasury cannot and will not
be released to the public with a moment's
verdict.
Cold that is worth $ 1.(19 cannot be handed
out for *1.00. No government could stand
that kind of pressure. II the Supreme Court
ruled today that gold must be released, the
only filing left for the (lovernmcnt to do would
be to place a 09 per cent tax on all gold pay
ments and let it go at thai.
Result: status quo, and there would be
other things to worry about.
On the other hand, if the Supreme Court
finds some way to get around the matter, it
can and may very possibly rule either that
the government action is perfectly legal, or
lliat contract debts need not be met in gold
with the exception of those national obliga
tions to foreign governments.
Of course, there are a dozen other alterna
tives in between, going all the way to com
plete payment of both public and private con
tracts in gold.

II is probable that the "wise men" will he
most sagacious and practical. If is improbable
I(Kit business will be thrown into chaos with
next week's decision.
Rut it is very probable that business will
continue to wonder about future decisions
that may or may not affect the constitution
ality of other actions that have already been
taken under the wing of the NRA.
During the past two years. Congress has
been mosl liberal with its delegation of
powers.
.1 list how liberal mav it continue to be?
