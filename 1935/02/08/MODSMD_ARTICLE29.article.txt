Two California students were recently ap
prehended at :t lucrative business selling de
tailed reports of lectures lo their friends.
Some round dozen classes were "covered" by
the system, in which shorthand notes were
taken, edited, and mimeographed. The notes
sold al live cents per copy, until the pair were
forcibly induced to forego the racket by the
indignant professors.
The students were excellent business men
bill poor psychologists: a litlle persuasion
shoul I have made clear lo the professors that
the public could only condemn I hem for the
insipidilv of their lectures and applaud (lie
boys for their ingenuity and energy.
Il a "teacher" puts nothing into his dis
course which a clever youth cannot dislill and
put into handy graphic form, then il is not a
teacher but an automaton which the school
is hiring. II could do heller to buy a book and
obtain a boy with a clear voice to read lo the
class for fifty cents an hour.
Or heller yet, il could print I he professor's
lectures itself and distribute Ihem to I he slu

dents. There's no efficiency sitting on un
comfortable seats for an hour to learn what
might he read on the printed page in fifteen
minutes.
