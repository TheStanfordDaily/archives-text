# A 						Dole Avoided
## 
### 
Hut for the dramatic last-minute appear
ance of Senator McAdoo, whose vote defeated
the proposition, the Senate appropriations
committee Wednesday would have foisted a
direct dole of nearly three billion dollars upon
Congress in place of President Roosevelt's five
billion dollar public works plan.
Yes, three billion dollars is cheaper than
five billions, in the short run at least. The
plan would pare down the government deficit
and it would doubtless be sufficient to feed the
ft
needy and slave oil starvation for another
fiscal year.
Hut cost must not be measured in terms of
dollars and cents alone. America is faced
with a grave social deficit that may in the long
run be far more disastrous than any budge
tary deficit, however large. Millions upon mil
lions have been out of work for years. For
a time they were faced by actual starvation.
Then a change of government brought into
being a snore paternalistic policy thai pro
vided food, at least, for the starving.
Men do not live by bread alone, however.
Enforced idleness has torn down self-respect,
ambition, honesty, willingness to work, and
various other of the sturdy virtues that Amer
ica has prized since pioneer days. These are
the qualities that America is built upon and
thai she will need in the great work of recon
struction which lies ahead.
A dole would only aggravate the condition.
Public works would provide tangible, lasting
results and, what is more important, would
keep a vast army of men occupied who would
otherwise stagnate in idleness.
The issue is joined and the alternative
seems clear —except to a few recalcitrant
members of "the world's greatest deliberative
bodv."
