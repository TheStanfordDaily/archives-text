## NINE OLD MEN 
### CROMPTON BANCS, Jr 
! WASHINGTON. D.C., Feb. 7—While the country
j waits for their decision nine old men are deliberating
in a musty conference room in the capitol. The eldest is
I 77, the youngest 60. Taken as a whole they represent a.
i fair ci oss-section of the American public. Four are what
I might be called "conservatives," three are "liberals,"
j while two are "middle-of-the-roaders." More often than
| not the last two groups are l'ound together, making the
! famous 5-4 decisions.
These men composing the supreme court arc trying
to decide whether three men and one bank should be
i paid in 100-cent dollars instead of 59-cent dollars now
' that the U.S. has seized all the gold and devalued the;
[ dollar. The amounts in question are small, ranging from
| $10.60 in one case to $50,000 in another. But the court's
' decision might affect, one hundred billion dollar's worth
i of securities in the U.S.. and force their issuers to pay
' $1.69 for every dollar of face value. For thai reason m<.st
! businesses are holding their breath, waiting lo see what
! the court will decide next Monday.
In any event the court will have to find something
either in the constitution, or in their previous decisions,
I interpreting it to support their position. Behind their
| decision lies a long period wherein the court has helped
I make the constitution elastic enough to provide for the
| country's growth.
Il is quite likely that the fathers of the consti
tution never suspected the power they had given to
the supreme court. At first it was (bought of merely
as a federal court to settle whatever legal disputes
were forbidden to the state courts. But in 1803 John
Marshall held tlvt the powers of Congress were
limited and defined, and that the supreme court was
to formulate the definitions and mark off the
limitations.
From that time to the present the court has applied
I the constitutional yardstick to one measure or another,
j constantly broadening its interpretations. The history
| of this growth falls roughly into five great periods.
During the first of these the court was primarily con
cerned in defining its own powers and in clarifying the
relationship between the states and the federal govern
ment. With the slavery question it was naturally con-
I cerned with cases arising out of Ihis issue which ser
| iously threatened the life of the Union. During the third
} period it had to deal with questions arising out of the
j Civil War and the rebuilding of the federal structure.
| The next period marked by the rapid evolution of Big
Business saw the court rendering decisions brought
| about by these new economic conditions.
I Now entering the fifth period of its history, (he
I court v/ill have to settle the question as to how far the
I federal government may and can go in planning and
J directing the economic life of its people. The decision
i rendered a few weeks ago declaring a small portion of
the NRA unconstitutional is perhaps a signpost on the
road to the forthcoming gold clause decision but no
more.
The main point at issue in this case is this: which is
j worse—breaking down the sacredness of contracts or the
j chaos that will surely follow if the ii- sacredness is
j upheld?
It is very likely that no definite answer will he
given as to the constitutionality of the New Deal, hut
the court will have to say yes or no to four issues:
(1) Did the U.S. have the right to seize gold?
(2) Was the method it used in doing so unconsti
, tutional? (15) Did the seizure of gold void Uncle
Sam's contract to pay the holders of his Liberty
Bonds in gold? (4) Since this seizure made it impos
sible for corporations to pay (heir debts in cold,
did Otis void their contracts to do so? Or must they
pay the gold equivalent ($1.6!)) in devalued dollars?
I Each of there questions will probably be decided
! separately, and because the court says yes to one, it does
not necessarily follow it will say yes to all.
But the constitution has survived a long time end
has shown itself suited to the purposes of the people
under circumstances none of its makers could have
foreseen. In the past the people have found that when
new and unexpected situations turned up they w ie
left with liberty to handle them. In the past as now
the court has shown that the motto of one of our
largest motor manufacturers—"An : ar to the ground,
;ui eye to the future" Tils it remarkably well.

It is very likely that no definite answer will he

the court will have to say yes or no to four issues:

(2) Was the method it used in doing so unconsti

Sam's contract to pay the holders of his Liberty
Bonds in gold? (4) Since this seizure made it impos
sible for corporations to pay (heir debts in cold,
did Otis void their contracts to do so? Or must they
pay the gold equivalent ($1.6!)) in devalued dollars?

' $1.69 for every dollar of face value. For thai reason m<.st
! businesses are holding their breath, waiting lo see what
! the court will decide next Monday.
In any event the court will have to find something
either in the constitution, or in their previous decisions,
I interpreting it to support their position. Behind their
| decision lies a long period wherein the court has helped
I make the constitution elastic enough to provide for the
| country's growth.
Il is quite likely that the fathers of the consti
tution never suspected the power they had given to
the supreme court. At first it was (bought of merely
as a federal court to settle whatever legal disputes
were forbidden to the state courts. But in 1803 John
Marshall held tlvt the powers of Congress were
limited and defined, and that the supreme court was
to formulate the definitions and mark off the
limitations.
From that time to the present the court has applied
I the constitutional yardstick to one measure or another,
j constantly broadening its interpretations. The history
| of this growth falls roughly into five great periods.
During the first of these the court was primarily con
cerned in defining its own powers and in clarifying the
relationship between the states and the federal govern
ment. With the slavery question it was naturally con-
I cerned with cases arising out of Ihis issue which ser
| iously threatened the life of the Union. During the third
} period it had to deal with questions arising out of the
j Civil War and the rebuilding of the federal structure.
| The next period marked by the rapid evolution of Big
Business saw the court rendering decisions brought
| about by these new economic conditions.
I Now entering the fifth period of its history, (he
I court v/ill have to settle the question as to how far the
I federal government may and can go in planning and
J directing the economic life of its people. The decision
i rendered a few weeks ago declaring a small portion of
the NRA unconstitutional is perhaps a signpost on the
road to the forthcoming gold clause decision but no
more.
The main point at issue in this case is this: which is
j worse—breaking down the sacredness of contracts or the
j chaos that will surely follow if the ii- sacredness is
j upheld?
It is very likely that no definite answer will he
given as to the constitutionality of the New Deal, hut
the court will have to say yes or no to four issues:
(1) Did the U.S. have the right to seize gold?
(2) Was the method it used in doing so unconsti
, tutional? (15) Did the seizure of gold void Uncle
Sam's contract to pay the holders of his Liberty
Bonds in gold? (4) Since this seizure made it impos
sible for corporations to pay (heir debts in cold,
did Otis void their contracts to do so? Or must they
pay the gold equivalent ($1.6!)) in devalued dollars?
I Each of there questions will probably be decided
! separately, and because the court says yes to one, it does
not necessarily follow it will say yes to all.
But the constitution has survived a long time end
has shown itself suited to the purposes of the people
under circumstances none of its makers could have
foreseen. In the past the people have found that when
new and unexpected situations turned up they w ie
left with liberty to handle them. In the past as now
the court has shown that the motto of one of our
largest motor manufacturers—"An : ar to the ground,
;ui eye to the future" Tils it remarkably well.
