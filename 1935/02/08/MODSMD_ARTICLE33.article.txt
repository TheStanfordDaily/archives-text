# BULL SESSION
## FIRE! FIRE! FIRE! 
### 
By a stroke of fate, Encina Hall i
' has not yet burned to the ground.
The old heap still .stands—packed
I with wood, packed with potential
death. Encina stands. But it stands
l as a fire trap—ready at a moment's
. notice to furnish the campus with
a bonfire rivaling anything ever
! prepared for Big Game.
Today freshmen are circulating a
j petition asking the Administration
! to make their dwelling more safe for
i life and limb. They are asking little
| enough: that Encina be afforded
I protection against fire hazard. There '
|is no good reason for subjecting
{ frosh—compelled to live in Encina
| —to unsafe conditions that menace
j no other large living group on the
| campus. Even Sequoia Hall—with
| lav fewer residents than Encina—has
I a better system of fire escapes than
the rendezvous of the freshmen. ,
J
While attention is directed at the ;
| fire menace, a number of other de- j
I tails of Farm fire protection would j
j merit the attention of the Adminis- j
I tration. On a scattering of Farm
J bulletin boards are fire notices. ;
| These notices are supposed to make i
! Stanford men and women more
i ready to meet the demon fire. On
| them are the fire-whistle designa-
J tions of various spots on the campus,
and the telephone numbers of the
I Stanford and Palo Alto fire depart
' ments,

Lot us imagine that fire breaks
out in the History Building. A stu
dent rushes to the bulletin board to
get the {ihone number of the local
file laddirs: Palo Alto 106S, .says the
notice. The student makes for the
nearest phone and calls 1666. But
the operator tells him that it is a
wrong number. The student calls
Palo Alto 292; the notice says that
is the number of the Palo Alto Fire
Department. But the operator tells
him that is a wrong number. The
student calls Palo Alio 900, local 82;
the notice says that, too, is the'num
ber of the Campus Fire Department.
But the operator says that that,
too, is a wrong number. By this time
the student has decided to let the
building burn down.

Fire whistles are equally vague.
The fireman on duty day before yes
terday declared that 19 whistles
blew Encina. The Encina fire notice
says 22 whistles blow Encina to
arms. And yesterday the fireman on
duty was sure that 21, 23, or 24
whistles was the Encina fire signal.

While money is being expended
for paving mud flats, and floating
the Union in sinking funds, a small
sum could well be set aside to im
prove the Stanford Fire Depart
ment, and make Farm dwellings safe
for Farm students.

Today freshmen are circulating a
j petition asking the Administration
! to make their dwelling more safe for
i life and limb. They are asking little
| enough: that Encina be afforded
I protection against fire hazard. There '
|is no good reason for subjecting
{ frosh—compelled to live in Encina
| —to unsafe conditions that menace
j no other large living group on the
| campus. Even Sequoia Hall—with
| lav fewer residents than Encina—has
I a better system of fire escapes than
the rendezvous of the freshmen. ,
J
While attention is directed at the ;
| fire menace, a number of other de- j
I tails of Farm fire protection would j
j merit the attention of the Adminis- j
I tration. On a scattering of Farm
J bulletin boards are fire notices. ;
| These notices are supposed to make i
! Stanford men and women more
i ready to meet the demon fire. On
| them are the fire-whistle designa-
J tions of various spots on the campus,
and the telephone numbers of the
I Stanford and Palo Alto fire depart
' ments,

Lot us imagine that fire breaks
out in the History Building. A stu
dent rushes to the bulletin board to
get the {ihone number of the local
file laddirs: Palo Alto 106S, .says the
notice. The student makes for the
nearest phone and calls 1666. But
the operator tells him that it is a
wrong number. The student calls
Palo Alto 292; the notice says that
is the number of the Palo Alto Fire
Department. But the operator tells
him that is a wrong number. The
student calls Palo Alio 900, local 82;
the notice says that, too, is the'num
ber of the Campus Fire Department.
But the operator says that that,
too, is a wrong number. By this time
the student has decided to let the
building burn down.

Fire whistles are equally vague.
The fireman on duty day before yes
terday declared that 19 whistles
blew Encina. The Encina fire notice
says 22 whistles blow Encina to
arms. And yesterday the fireman on
duty was sure that 21, 23, or 24
whistles was the Encina fire signal.

While money is being expended
for paving mud flats, and floating
the Union in sinking funds, a small
sum could well be set aside to im
prove the Stanford Fire Depart
ment, and make Farm dwellings safe
for Farm students.

By a stroke of fate, Encina Hall i
' has not yet burned to the ground.
The old heap still .stands—packed
I with wood, packed with potential
death. Encina stands. But it stands
l as a fire trap—ready at a moment's
. notice to furnish the campus with
a bonfire rivaling anything ever
! prepared for Big Game.
