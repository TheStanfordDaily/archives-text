Hashers' motto: He also serves |

The class of '35 of a certain house
up the row had a last roundup in a
; letreat in the Santa Cruz mountains.
j During the course of the evening,
while the boys were playing merry -
I go-round in concentric circles around
i the room, two of the hardy men of
| '35 decided they had had enough oi'
j such child's play and went out on
the highway to thumb rides. There
! was really nothing unusual in such
j a procedure, except for the fact that
all they had on was a sweat shirt.
Reports have trickled in lhat the
Thetas have been acting up again,
i It used to be around these parts
i that the Thetas were considered the
' refined and conservative influence
j on the How. Even Dr. Margery
I Bailey used to pause in the midst
of her lectures to pay tribute to the
i "thirty professors' daughters." But
; times are changed. On one of our
; recent week - end pajama - clad
| Thetas got up on the top of the
Theta house and in the dead of the
1 night sang loud and lousy songs.
! Across the street in the Deke house,
strong men turned white with fear,
j Next door in the Beta house, loud
j and profane words were heard. But
I the Thetas continued their little
j ceremony, even to parading in the
j backyard by torchlight.
A couple of Delts have been seen
| tea dancing in the city. But that's
i rot half as funny as being seen tea
I dancing in the law library.
| Some of the sororities celebrated
I.Chinese New Year's, which was last,
j Monday, quite suddenly, when the
j Chinese cooks set off firecrackers in
! the dining room. Said Wong:
j "Makum good smell."
One of the clever tales of gay, col-
I lege youth concerns a week-end
J foray. It seems that a favorite trick
; of gay high school and grammar
school girls is to pick out the name
I of a fraternity house in the direc- ■
tory and then call up and ask foi

["Bill," "Joe," or "Dick." When Bill,
Joe, or Dick answers the phone and
asks "What do you want?," the
i answer . invariably comes: "You'll
do."
It happened that at one house re
; cently a group of six fine, upstand
ing youths clustered around the
phone. At about 12 o'clock the con
versation had got off the Einstein
theory and onto an invitation to
1 come down for "coffee and cake.*'
So all six of the gentlemen care
fully prettied themselves and de
parted for Palo Alto.
The girls turned out to be about
14 years old.
So the conversation got back on
the Einstein theory. But about in the
middle of the forum, the elder sister
appeared on the scene. The gentle
men departed for home.
No sooner had they arrived than
the phone was ringing again. It was
the elder sister. She wanted the
boys to come down for coffee and
! cake.
