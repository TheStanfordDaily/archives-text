The Editor, Sir:
It was with not a little satisfac
tion that I read your editorial in re
gard to the Orange Juice situation.
I have always been annoyed at
the colossal nerve of the Union man
agement in charging 10 cents for a
small glass" of exceedingly "low
proof" juice.
Coffee at one time sold for 10 cents,
milk for seven. Vigorous campaigns
on the part of your paper were vic
toirous over the laborious efforts of
the highly skilled "cost accountants'
of the Union Board to justify the
rank overcharge. It would at least
be entertaining to have the account
ants juggle the cent fractions until
the total cost of putting a small glass
of "watered beverage" on the Union
counter exceeded five cents.
The old plan of "the pi ice the kids
will pay is a reasonable price" should
be converted into a plan of "the
price for which non-monopolistic or
ganizations can sell, and sell at a
profit, is a reasonable price for the
" 'non-profit' Stanford Union" even
though it will take two years instead
of one to pay for the twenty-thou
sand dollar addition.
