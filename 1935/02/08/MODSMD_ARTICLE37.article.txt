# DEFEND IC4A TITLE
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Last May, when the dispute arose
as to whether the Stanford track
team should attend the IC4A. per
mission was finally granted 'by the
Board of Athletic Control, with the
subsequent approval of the Faculty
Athletic Committee — the latter
group giving its approval upon the
recommendation that as the IC4A
was not a representative meet, Stan
ford should not compete in this meet
again.
If that recommendation had been
made by the Board of Athletic Con
trol, very little could be saitf in
regard to its sanction —fur that is
the body which decides such mat
ters —BUT, once that body has ap
proved the trip, the power of the i
Faculty Athletic Committee is lim
ited to the scholastic standing of the ,
members of the team. To make my
self perfectly clear, as long as the
B.A.C. approves the trip, the faculty
committee can only prevent the
team from going if the grades of the
team members are too poor to war
rant them being away from school
for any length of time. In other
words, the recommendation mad?.
by the faculty committee was not j
only absolutely outside of its juris- i
diction, but a bold usurpation of the
powers of the Board of Athletic
Control.
Three of the members of the fac
ulty committee, namely, Dr. Storey,
Professor Owens and Dr. Mitchell,
are also members of the Board of
Athletic Control. As the action taken
by this latter body is a matter of
public record, it is common knowl
edge that the three faculty members
were the ones who opposed having
Stanford compete in the IC4A —but
they were over-ruled by the rest of
the members. However, the trip was
approved by the B.A.C. without any
recommendations attached.
Professor Hinsey and Professor
Mears, Ihe other two members of the
Faculty Athletic Committee, favored
approving the trip without any such
silly recommendation being made by
that body, but their two votes were
not sufficient to defeat the stand
taken by Dr. Storey, Dr. Mitchell
and Professor Owens.
The hitch in the recommendation
is the statement that the IC4A is
not a representative meet, as is the
NCAA. Only those colleges which
belong to the Intercollegiate Athletic
Association are eligible to compete,
while practically any school in the
country can gain acceptance to com
pete in the NCAA. In the East the
IC4A is the BIG MEET of the year,
duly recognized not only by the
majority of colleges, but by the ma
jority of athletic organizations. Evi
dence of this is found in the amount
of space given the IC4A in the news
papers and other publications. In
comparison, the NCAA received
very little mention last year in any
New York paper, and not a line in
Time —which carried quite a story of
the results of the IC4A.
But let us assume that Stanford
abandons the IC4A. What then is to
become of her teams competing in
thes national meets? Such a ques
tion is not hard to answer*.
Last year was the first time the
NCAA was held on the Pacific Coait.
It is to be held here again this year.
All well and good, but when it is
held out here it is held late so that
the Eastern schools can compete.
But it will undoubtedly be moved
back to the East next year, and the
dates for that meet in the East are
always the second Friday and Sat- j
urday in June—just the time our j
finals are getting under way here at j
Stanford. Therefore, we would not j
only be out of the IC4A but it would |
be next to impossible to gain the ap- j
proval of the Faculty committee to I
attend the NCAA, falling as it would ,
during finals.
It was the whole-hearted support
of the students which sent the team j
East last year. That this support was
well given is evidenced by the team's
record in that meet. That same sup
port is needed even more this year.
The members of the team are rep- '
resenting Ihe students of the Uni
versity; it is these students who can i
again show their support to send a
small, but point-grabbing track
team to the IC4A.
The team should defend its cham- |
pionship.
Sincerc'.y yours,
George W. Edmonds, "34
