# FIGHTING FATHER COUGHLIN

(This, the first of a scries on Father Charles Edward Coughlin,
>. 1 Catholic radio preacher and publicist of the priesthood, endeavors
show his background and gradual rise to eminence.)
[n 1911, the University of Toronto gave a doctorate to a young man j
I, who had specialized in politics, sociology, and the church. In 1935,
same man has probably 20,000,000 radio listeners, and ranks as
rica's topnotch non-ofTiee-holding demagogue.
Coughlin was Canadian-born, though being of American parentage,
vas ordained a Roman Catholic priest in 1916. The unusual portion of
ife began in 192G when he was sent into Royal Oak (near Detroit) to
>li.sh a church.
When the parish was founded a little money was left over. As an
periment, Coughlin purchased radio time in October 1927. He
{ended to attempt lessing intolerance, and at the same time to further
•itholic faith and thought by explaining it.
Little attention was paid to his talks until, in 1930, apparently by
lent, he introduced political ideals and comments into them. Within
s months half a million letters poured in. Coughlin found the -public
e amazingly ignorant concerning the attitude of the Catholic church
ird labor and modern industrial maladjustments.
"His task, then, was to get the people of the U.S.A. into touch with
Church and Leo Xlll's great pronouncements in favor of the laboring
fes. That he is rendering his church a service is evident, since, despite
jantings and the rebukes of William Cardinal O'Connell (of another
ict), Coughlin is supported by most of the priesthood, is backed by
mmediate superior, Bishop Gallagher, and was even commended once
;he Pope.
Two hundred thousand letters rolled in when CBS took him off the
• for Four years ago his "Golden Hour of the Little Flower,"
jis heard over an average of 22 stations, of which 17 were paid, the
jrs being "cut-ins." $8300 a week was the cost, financed from the
iluntary contributions coming in the mail which averaged 50,000 letters
week. This meant 10,000,000 listeners, if radio compilation systems
|e to be believed. About two letters in a thousand were adverse, and
ose mostly from his co-religionists.
TEvery month nearly 200,000 copies of Leo XIII's famous encyclical,
fum Novarum," which favors liberality by the Church in a modern
Id and depicts the lot of labor, were requested and sent out. Each week
30 Coughlin sermon copies were mailed.
Why this popularity? Here are a couple of samples of the Coughlin
v—a strange blend of social resentment and religion that packs a
eful punch:
"We suffer not so much from depression as oppression!"
And again: "It is idle to talk of relieving conditions by a speeding
methods which brought on these self-same conditions. Such relief
but temporary . . . one salvation . . . We must return to the spirit
Leo XIII and St. Francis—the spirit of Christ."
Coughlin had the traditional attitude of the Church, which has long
d for the welfare of the working classes—St. Augustine propounded the
■>ry lhat every man has the right to work for a decent living. Repeatedly
referred to Pius's instruction to throw every effort into the struggle
4 social justice.
Says the father of himself: "I am neither Republican, Democrat,
nor Socialist. I glory in the fact that I am a simple Catholic priest,
endeavoring to inject Christianity into . . . the economic system . . .
woven of greed . . . by cunning fingers who manipulate for their selfish
purposes."
With "Christ or Chaos" as his battle-cry, he was and is equally inimical
to capitalism, communism, and 'subversive' socialism. Social unrest and
evil conditions he placed at the door of greedy money barons and atheistic
collectivists. He lumps all "isms" under one head, holding that they are
manifestations of the same disease. His crusade is for a return to the
principles of Christ.
Wholesale charitable work has been undertaken by Coughlin in a
first-class manner, and no doubt keeps many of the wolves from howling
at him. His extreme care in facts and figures have kept refutations and
counter-attacks down a good deal. A carefully concealed inexplicitness
aids him as it has so many orators.
Tomorrow we look at the good father's system of operation, accom
plishments, and more of his varied statements. %
