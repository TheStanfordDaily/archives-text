"MARY PETERS," by Mary Ellen
Chaise. Macmillan Co. $2.50. At the
Cellar Bookstore.
Acclaimed and ballyhooed as one
of the outstanding recent fiction
publications, this story falls far shorty

tempts to show th<

of its press
agent's promises.
In telling the
history of Mary
Peters, offspring
of one of the
last of the
Maine seafaring
families, it at
le decadence and

death of this type of stock; but it
has been written not only poorly,
but with little purpose.
Mary Peters, born at sea, and
brought up on ship-board, comes
home to a small New England town
to live; the story deals with her at
i tempts at readjustment, with her
brother's struggle for happiness,
with the unhappy, futile existence of
Jim Pendleton, and with Sarah Pet
ers' philosophy of life. The novel
lacks, however, not only emphasis
but reality. Perhaps it attempts to
point out a moral or to show char
acter; whatever it tries, it is mired
under and bogged by over-descrip
tion and faulty characterization.
—Hayes
Earl Grace, Pitt Pirate catcher,
hasn't stolen a base in five years.
