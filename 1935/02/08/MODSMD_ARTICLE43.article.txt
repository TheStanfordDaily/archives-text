# Campus Factory Makes Many Frosted Goodies
## 
### ERNESTINE MAGAGNA 
No matter where you have your
seconds on ice cream —Lagunita,
Encina, Ihe Union, Stanford Golf
Club, or Searsville Lake—it all comes
from that same basement corner of
I the Union, where the Stanford "ice
1 cream factory" holds sway to the
I tune of 16,000 gallons of ice cream
i per year, plus 1500 gallons of sher
bet, and 2500 gallons of syrup on the
side.
The Stanford "ice cream factory - '
| is a very modest little plant con
i sisting of one shiny twelve-gallon
1 freezer of the electrically-operated
j variety, one very cold ice box filled
I with tall cylindrical cans that con
i tain frosty, luscious-looking ice
! creams and sherbets, plus a mild
I sprinkling of things and gadgets.
Dewey Manages
Harold Dewey, a man who has
j made his niche in the confectioners'
j hall of fame, is the combination
I manager and operator of the plant.
! Lying in a small locked drawer in
| the "factory" is a medal earned by
j Dewey before his Stanford ice cream
days. It was given him by the Cali
fornia Associated Candy Makers for
creating an elaborate candy basket
filled with intricately made fruits
and flowers.
In 1926, however, Stanford insti
tuted an ice cream plant, and Dewey
deserted the candy field. Since then,
i with the help of an assistant, hg has
been concocting such favorite ice
| creams as chocolate flakes, maple
nut, peppermint, and such special
ties as gutter-nut, caramel-nut,
rocky road, ,pnd oihers, as well as
the ordinary chocolate and vanilla
type.
On the side he and his assistant

make a few hundred gallons of sher
bets, and a few more hundred gal
lons of syrups. They also fill private
orders, and Dewey often decorates
individual ice cream cups with tiny
frosted flowers, dainty ice cream

ships, and other suitable designs.
Forty-odd di ffer en t flavored
creams and ices have been frozen in
the plant's shiny twelve-gallon
freezer, but 15 to' 20 different fla
vors are considered enough to keep
on hand daily.
The ice cream that goes to feed the
"cream loving Stanford people" is
not only good to the taste and good
to the eye, but it is higher than the
avei'age in butterfat, Dewey smiled,
and not so good for the figure.
