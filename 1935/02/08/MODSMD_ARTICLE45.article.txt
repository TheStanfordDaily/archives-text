# STRIKE IN SAN FRANCISCO
## 
### John McClelland, '37 
Th e following two interviews, exclusive to the Daily, with Captain
O. E. Rob-tad, executive in the Masters,' Mates and Pilots Association, and
"Betty Jane" Ed Bettencourt, chief strike breaker of the employers, present
representative attitudes of the two factions—labor and employers.
LABOR
"Right now tin- hottest spot in the maritime labor controversy is
in our union, the Masters, Mates and Pilots Association," says Captain
Rolstad. "Longshoremen and seamen have been taken care of—their
agreements have been made—but we arc still working under the
conditions that existed before the strike.
"The employers keep delaying settlement because the longer they |
keep paying us the low standard of wages it Ls more money in their j
pocket*. We have been gently forcing the issue with small strikes, but;
with little effect. We are not revolutionists. We want to bring about better
working conditions gradually, not all at once, but we are handicapped
by the rank and file membership who can't see why they can't have
everything right now.
"There are some workers who would never be satisfied if anything is i
done or if anybody does it. This dissatisfied group, however, is in the j
minority.
"The employers realize they must yield some things and it is only j
because of that "must" that they are doing it. It is only natural that the I
employers should use every method to fight and delay. I wouldn't even be ■
surprised if they went to court. But the battle will never stop."
Captain Rolstad, soft spoken and scholarly, cannot help but intimate
tlrU a stirring unrest is develiping. His union hasn't been given the |
consideration that the others have and there is nothing they can do
but strike. But, as he says, "It would be foolish to strike now since
the longshoremen and seamen wouldn't want to go out now because
they arc bound to peace by agreements until September 1.
Finally Captain Rolstad sounded the keynote of wax'ning which, if:
nothing else, will bring the employers to their knees.
"When the agreement runs out next fall, the employers will have a !
chance to sign up again. If they don't come through we'll have to knock J
them on the head again. We always hold the club."
EMPLOYERS
Big, loud-mouthed, but good-natured Ed Bettencourt shouts his j
views. He is not an employer but he works for them and he is on the inside, i
"We know the I.L.A. Isn't satisfied with their award," he booms. I
"They'll never be satisfied; it's only human. And the radical bunch of j
in control will never let things quiet down."
Bettencourt presides over notorious "Fink" hall, headquarters of the
"Scabs." He keeps complete records of strikebreakers—where they livo
and how soon they can get to work if a strike is called. His chief job is
keeping these records up to date. He admits that the "Marine Service
Bureau," as Fink hall is called, doesn't perform its supposed function of
hiring seamen. Waiting with him in case of emergency ai"e eight other men
and a veritable arsenal of weapons.
"The attitude of the employers now is just to get along until the
agreements run out. They don't want a strike and will do almost any
thing to avert one.
"But we never can tell when a strike is coming. Unions may even
go out separately. Some can't strike because they would be violating
contracts. the unions gained in the last strike gave them the
impression they have a lot of power. They're overbearing, arrogant.
And finally Employer Representative Bettencourt voiced the fear that
haunts every ship owner.
"The I.L.A. may go out anytime."
"But," he added grimly, "when they do (and he inclined his head
toward his aides and scab files) we are prepared to go to work within two
hours."
