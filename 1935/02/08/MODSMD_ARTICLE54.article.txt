# CARD GALL TEAM MEETS SAN JOSE
## 
### 
Backed by confidence gained in
recent wins over all - star nines,
Harry Wolter's Indian varsity will
oppose San Jose State varsity at
2:30 o'clock tomorrow afternoon on
the sunken diamond.
Tuesday's decisive win over A1
Earle's All-Stars gave the Stanford
practice season as promising an
opening as it has enjoyed in recent
years, due largely to steady and
effective pitching. Tuesday it was
Fred Heringer and Johnny Campbell
who held the opponents to two runs.
Tomorrow Stan Anderson, veteran
right - hander and considered by
some fans as the Cards' leading hurl
er for the coming conference season,
will undoubtedly get the call.
Heringer and Campbell had a
steadier infield Tuesday than had
previously supported Indian pitch
ers this season. The shortstop posi
tion, the one giving Wolter the most
trouble this year, is still being con
tested by Frank Tremaine and Arch
Zamloch, with the former probably
starting tomorrow as he did Tues
day.
The remainder of the line-up will
be Gordy Mallatratt at first base,
Jim Wooley at second, and Hank
Edwards on the hot sack. A1 Brent
in left, Ted Leidig in center, and Ed
Holman at right will compose the
outfield, while Mike Ferro will be
behind the plate.
