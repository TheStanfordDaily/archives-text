# FROSH TRACK ATHLETES BEGIN INTENSE TRAINING
## 
### GORDON FROST 
As March 2,-date of the Stanford
frosh track team's first meet, looms :
near, Angell Field has become the I
scene of intense training for some
30 aspiring freshmen athletes. Nearly j
every event with the exception of;
the 880 is well represented.
With a constantly wet track to
handicap them, the frosh cinder men
have failed to turn in any startling j
early season times. A summary of j
events with their most promising
entries follows:
Entries Announced
Sprints—Strongest in this division j
is Jim Kneubuhl, who has run the
hundred in 10 flat and gives indi
cation that he may be able to better
this time. Knuebuhl is the only;
likely 220 man to appear but hasn't j
tried his legs at this event as yet. |
Ellington expects to put him to work :
on the half-lap run next week.
Hurdles — Coach Ellington has
three major contenders for hurdle j
honors this year in the persons of i
Cy Oberg, Ken Peters and Tom Col
lins. None of these men has made |
an exceptionally good showing yet
but bad weather may be to blame '
for slowing down their times.
440 and 880 —Chuck Carruthers ;
and Guy Hagerty have been turning |
in times of 53 and 54 seconds for the ■
quarter-mile run. No 880 man has j
been discovered.
Mile and two mile — The longer ,
runs will be taken care of by Etson
Burrows who turned in a time of i
4:37 for the mile last Friday, and |
John Dern, whom Ellington expects

1 to see better his time of 10:45 for
■ the eight-lap grind.
Broad jump, high jump, and pole
, vault—Tom Collins and Leo Mad
lem are the two outstanding broad
jumpers. Collins has been making
20 feet lOV2 inches. Madlem has
cleared 23 feet but so far this sea
: son is unable to reach his previous
mark.
I Ellington plans to use Hank Lui
setti, who will soon finish his frosh
basketball season, in the high jump.
The frosh eager has jumped 6 foot
2 inches during prep school days.
Sumner Gill, entering this quarter,
has showed much promise in the
vaulting event. Gill consistently
clears 12 feet and should go even
higher.
Shot, discus and javelin—Frosh
l footballer Glenn Hamilton has been
j heaving the shot 44 feet, the discus
13G to lead competitors in this line.
Grant Stone and John Partridge
look most favorable in the javelin
with throws ranging near 150 feet.
