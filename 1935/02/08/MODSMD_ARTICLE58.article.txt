# SWIMMERS CLASH WITH OAKLAND CLUB TOMORROW
## 
### john McClelland 
Determined to score their first
win of the season, Stanford swim
mers tomorrow afternoon will meet
the Lakeside Swimming Club of
Oakland in Encina pools.
The meet will be at 4 o'clock,
following the rugby game, and will
be free.
Nort Thornton's team is pre
pared to break into the win col
umn because the Oakland outlit
has never been much of a stum
bling block in the past and because
the Indians' best men perform in
the events where Lakeside is
strongest. The Cardinal coach
confidently announces that Stan
ford is favored to win.
High spots of the meet should be
the performance of Captain Bob Fos
ter in the breast stroke event and
the diving duel between Tom Boothe
of Stanford and Rufus Rusker of
Lakeside. Rusker was Pacific Coast
intercollegiate diving champion in
1933, and won All-American honors
the same year.
Milt Friedman, another Indian
diver who has been showing good
form this season, will be back in the
line-up after being kept out of last
week's competition with a cold.
Bob Hoover, Jack Juhn, Walter
Doyle, Martin Scatena, Alec Mac-

Kenzie, Bob Sutherland, Bob
Etienne, Holly Fitting, Dee Myers,
Bill Clemo, Don Peterson, and
Jack Bergman are the Indian
swimmers who should score points
tomorrow.
The events in which Stanford
should take points are the 400-yard
relay, medley relay, breast stroke,
back stroke, 440, 220, and 100 sprints.
