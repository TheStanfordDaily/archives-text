EXPLANATION NEEDED
FOR RUGBY FOOTBALL

Stanford's rugby team has been
drawing larger crowds each Satur
day, but still ihe "fans" for the most
part like the; game only because it
moves quickly and lots of things
happen. Very few really understand
the sport.
The California Rugby Union has
prepared an explanatory paper,
which is reprinted here in part for
benefit of the fan who does not un
derstand the game:
The object of the game is the
same as that in American football,
namely, to ground the ball over
fhe opponent's goal line and try
and *mU! the extra points after the
score, while the defense tries to
smear the man with the ball.
The main differences between the
two games are:
1. In rugby when the ball is put
into play after a stoppage, each side
has an equal chance of obtaining
possession of it.
2. In rugby there is no forward
passing, the ball must be thrown or
knocked back.
3. There is no interference allowed
in rugby.
4. All players in a rugby game
must be behind the ball or they are
liable to be penalized for being off
side.

NO YARDAGE PENALTIES
GIVEN IN RUGBY

5. In rugby penalty kicks are
given for breaches of the rules and
a field goal can be scored from such
a penalty kick. There is no such
penalty as "15 yards" against an
offending team.
A rugby team consists of fif
teen players: one fullback, four
three-quarterbacks, two half
j backs, and eight forwards.
The fullback is practically entirely
I a defensive player; he is the last
line of defense and seldom attacks.
The three-quarters are the attacking
division and must be favt and elu
sive; they should be able to handle
the ball and kick when running, and
must be sure tacklers. The half
backs must be very quick and al
ways "hounding" the ball just be
hind the forwards.
The forwards must be strong,
heavy, yet not slow; they follow
ii]> punts and should play as a
pack of eight men, not eight indi
viduals.
Rugby score values are as follpv/s:
Try (same as touchdown) 3
I Extra points, conversion after try 2
Dropped goal from field 4
Penalty goal 3
Goal scored from fair catch 3

SCRUM IS WAY TO
PUT BALL IN PLAY

I "In touch" is the rugby equiva
lent of "out of bounds." The ball is
brought into play by being thrown
at least five yards into the field at
right angles to the "touch line."
A "scrum" is formed by eight
j forwards on each side binding to
gether, with the three men in the
front row of each team fating each
other and locking heads. This for
mation is the principal manner of
I bringing the hall into play after a
stoppage.
i The ball is rolled by a back into
the space between the two packs of
i forwards, and the object for each
team is to secure the ball with their

! feet and hook it back to the scrum
| half who is waiting behind the
| forwards.
j A scrum is (.-ailed by the referee
I for any minor infringement of the
| "rules. For a major infringment, such
I as intentional offside or foul play, a
! penalty kick is awarded to the non
! offending team.
The game is controlled by a ref
! cree with two linesmen to judge at
! what point the ball went into touch.
I Playing time is usually GO or 80
I minutes, divided into two halves.
There is no "time out" except in (he
] event of an injury, when a player
I may be allowed three minutes to
j recover. â€”Browne
