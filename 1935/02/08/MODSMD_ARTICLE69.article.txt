# WINDS OF FREEDOM BLOW AGAIN
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Has The Daily become a training |
school for embryonic Hearst report
ers (perhaps best described as
stooges) or has it already succumbed
to the charms of the Hearst mil
lions at the price of a dictated edi
torial policy? Hearst is avowedly
intent on keeping the world safe
for Democracy; must Stanford be;
intent on keeping the world safe for
Hearst? Let the winds of freedom
blow without Hearstian propulsion
or propaganda.
According to Mr. Hearst's defini
tion. a bad citizen is one who waits
until a fire has spread before call- !
ing attention to the situation. We
should like to remind Mr. Hearst of j
the $500 fine imposed on the citizen j
who calls the fire department in the |
absence of a fire.
