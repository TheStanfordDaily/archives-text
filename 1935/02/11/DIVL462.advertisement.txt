What Napoleon did during the four fateful
years between his betrothal to the beautiful
young Marie Louise of Austria, and his exile
to Elba, the world has long known. But what
he thought, what he felt, what he dreamed have
heretofore never been disclosed.
Now the very soul of France's most glorious
figure is laid bare through the recent and
astounding discovery of more than 300 letters he
wrote to the girl he made Empress of his domains
—and who made herself Empress 6t his heart.
These letters, kept secret by the Empress' des
cendants for 121 years, reveal a romance truly
heroic in stature, a passion of such power as
only one so masterful as Bonaparte could know.
By arrangement with the Government of France
the entire astounding series of 318 letters, to
gether with brilliant explanatory comment, is to
be published—and for the first time —beginning
WEDNESDAY, Feb. 13, and continuing
