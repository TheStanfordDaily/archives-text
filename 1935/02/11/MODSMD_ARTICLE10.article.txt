# Friday's Risque Drama Provides Thrills, Laughs
## 
### Henry brill 
Aunt Min may not have screamed
when a strange man entered her
room at night, but the audience did
—with delight—last Friday evening,
when the Dramatic Council pre
sented the witty New York comedy
hit, "Her Master's Voice."
Clare Rummer's play Ls honestly
modern and full of brilliant humor,
and although several scenes may
have been termed "risque," they
were done so delicately that one saw
in them only their comedy and com
plete naturalness. The comedy is
"brilliant" because it isn't smart in
a merely superficial way, but arises
from the playwright's keen psycho
logical insight into the make-up of
average American womanhood.
The play is really more than a
series of witty lines; it is a very
intelligent study as well. Whether
the audience saw this or not, they
did enjoy the production—their gen
erous applause proved the presenta
tion to be the most popular dramatic
event at Stanford in several years.
New Stars Play
The cast, with the .exception of
Mary Ann Crary, was entirely new

to campus productions. And it was
really a genuine pleasure to see new
faces and new people. Except for oc
casional I-don't-know-what - to-do
with-my-hands and where-shall-T
-put-my-feet amateurisms, the cast
did as well as the "stock company"
we've been seeing around here for
the lust few years.
The cast was tri-Starred. Bernard
Wilson, as Ned Farrar, the harassed
husband, turned in a natural, easy
going first performance which com
pletely won the audience. Mary Ann
Crary, seen several years ago in "An
Enemy of the People," displayed a
distinct flair for comedy as the
proud, domineering, but lovable
Min. She pointed her comedy lines
especially well and brought out all
their hidden .subtleties.
Minor Holes
Aimelies Morgan, as Mrs. Martin,
Ned's mother-in-law, was outstand
ing. She made a definite and con
vincingly aged character out of her
role, and yet was not completely
shrewish. Katharine Comrie, as
Queena Farrar, was the girl who
was induced to forget an operatic
career while riding in a gondola, to :
her later regret. Miss Comrie was
pleasing, but somewhat hampered by
nervousness.
Dave Devlin played the part of
Mi\ TwilTing and gave a sincere |
characterization, if not a smooth or j
consistent one. Wilma Baker made
a successfully disrespectful maid,
and Harold Kahn was good as the
elderly chauffeur who was too tough j
to spend the night at "Dove Cot
tage." . _ |
Direction Good
William Murray Timmon's direc
tion v/as careful and accurate. Al
though the play calls for little action,
Mr. Timmons managed to keep the
stage groupings interesting and also |
maintained an even tempo, after a |
rather slow first act beginning, j
George Andreini's sets were very ;
attractive. He was intelligent and
original enough to build his sets
shallow; thus, the audience didn't
have to struggle for lines in compe
tition with the backstage, Victorian
dome.
