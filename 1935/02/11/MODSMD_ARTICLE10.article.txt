# Friday's Risque Drama Provides Thrills, Laughs

Aunt Min may not have screamed
when a strange man entered her
room at night, but the audience did
—with delight—last Friday evening,
when the Dramatic Council pre
sented the witty New York comedy
hit, "Her Master's Voice."
Clare Rummer's play Ls honestly
modern and full of brilliant humor,
and although several scenes may
have been termed "risque," they
were done so delicately that one saw
in them only their comedy and com

"brilliant" because it isn't smart in
a merely superficial way, but arises

event at Stanford in several years.

with-my-hands and where-shall-T
-put-my-feet amateurisms, the cast
did as well as the "stock company"
we've been seeing around here for
the lust few years.
The cast was tri-Starred. Bernard
Wilson, as Ned Farrar, the harassed
husband, turned in a natural, easy
going first performance which com
pletely won the audience. Mary Ann
Crary, seen several years ago in "An
Enemy of the People," displayed a
distinct flair for comedy as the
proud, domineering, but lovable
Min. She pointed her comedy lines
especially well and brought out all
their hidden .subtleties.

Aimelies Morgan, as Mrs. Martin,
Ned's mother-in-law, was outstand
ing. She made a definite and con
vincingly aged character out of her
role, and yet was not completely
shrewish. Katharine Comrie, as
Queena Farrar, was the girl who
