# Chinatown Pacifier Says Tong War Will Not Be

"Absolutely not!" said Churchill
; T. Chiu, president of the Chinese
| General Peace Association when
i questioned concerning rumors o|t
j imminent warfare in San Francisco's
! Chinatown. "There will be no Tong
| war in Chinatown in the future."
j Chiu, who is also a student at
Stanford and editor of The Chinese
Times, went on to explain the his-
I tory of Tongs and Tong wars and to
I tell of the work of his association in
I preventing the latter.
There are three kinds-of asso
| nations in Chinatown." he stated.
District organizations, whose incm
iK-rs originally camp from the
same district in China; family as
' smiations, whose members have
! the same surname and regard each
other as cousins; and Tongs.
Tongs arc not found in China.
[They arc organizations that grew up
in America in early pioneer days
pi imarily to protect those who do not
belong to u powerful family associa
tion. Large and powerful families
were ncit infrequently accustomed
in those rough times to oppress the
weaker individuals who had fewer

relatives in America. These banded
together for protection in an asso
ciation known as a Tong. Tong lit
erally means "hall" or "meeting
place."
Tongs and family associations
had both their good and bad sides.
They looked after their needy
members, on the one hand, but
they also took up (lie quarrels pf
their individual members.
Originally a Tong war was an
ordinary duel, to which the offended
member of one Tong or family chal
lenged the offending member of an
other Tong or family, the latter hav
ing refused to pay indemnity or to
redress his wrong. Later these duels
developed into regular pitched but
tles between the two Tongs, and fi
nally they degenerated into murder.
Thr Chinese General Peace Asso
ciation is a miniature League of Na
tions, in which each Tong and fam
ily is represented, and which settles
i disputes between Tongs peaceably.
Since Chiu's election to the presi
dency of the association six years
ago there have been no Tong wars
