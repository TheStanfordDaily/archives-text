''The individual who supports a
policy involving denial of a high
level of educational opportunity for
all of our people is in conflict with
one of the most important ideals of
American life," Dean Grayson B.
Kefauver, of the Stanford Univer
sity School of Education, said yes
terday in advance of a radio talk on
"Education and Americanism" to be
broadcast tonight at 8 o'clock from
station KGO.
"Those who charge that too many
young people are continuing in
school are usually thinking chiefly
of their own economic advantage or
fail to appreciate the social impli
cations of the policy which they pro
pose," Dean Kefauver declared.
Economic status of parents at this
late date in America still affects the
opportunity of the youth for an edu
cation, Dean Kefauver believes, and
he cites the fact that nearly half of
the adolescents are not enrolled in
high schools.
