sembly l-iall.
Dr. Lewis has long maintained that
the only exact opposite to science
is not-science or nescience, that is
to say, ignorance. He does not regard
either literature or religion as an
exact opposite to science. He thinks
that both science and literature are
subjects of natural interest to any
man, and knowledge of both gives
him a certain bilateral symmetry.
