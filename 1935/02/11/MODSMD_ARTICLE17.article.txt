# Famed Pianist Will Perform Here Thursday
## Stravinsky and Dushkin To Appear in Concert In Pavilion 
### 
Igor Stavinsky, modern com poser,
conductor, and pianist, will appear
this Thursday with Samuel Dushkin,
distinguished American violinist, in
the Pavilion at 8:20 o'clock.
The name of Stravinsky has be
come almost a legend even to un
musical persons throughout the
world, so great has his reputation be
come. He is considered the most in
fluential musical figure of modern
times, although he is today only 53
years of age.
Derided at First
A pupil of Rimsky-Korsakoff,
Stravinsky's compositions, first de
rided as the formless and unmelo
dious outpourings of a madman,
have proven to be the most potent
influence in modern music since
Beethoven, Brahms, and Wagner.
As one critic put it, Stravinsky has
been to modem music what Picasso
has been to modern painting, James
Joyce to modern literature, and
Brancussi to modern sculpture.
Stravinsky has appeared in Amer
ica on two previous occasions, in
1915 and in 1925, as guest conductor
with leading symphony orchestras.
To Conduct Orchestras
During his present visit, he will
conduct most of the leading Ameri
can symphonic bodies and appear
in joint recital with Dushkin, who
for the past five years has been his
collaborator.
Tickets for the concert are $2,
$1.50, and $1, and are on sale at the
Concert Series' office in the Old
Union and at Keeble's in Palo Alto.
