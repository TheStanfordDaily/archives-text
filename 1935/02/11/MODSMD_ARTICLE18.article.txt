Dr. Otto Rank, director of the
Psychological .Center in Paris, will
speak this afternoon at 4:15 in the
Little Theatre on "Modern Psychol
ogy and Social Change."
A personal friend and pupil of
Freud's, Dr. Rank was his assistant
and collaborator for twenty years
In 1926, however, he moved to Paris
because he felt that he no longer
could adhere to the orthodox psycho
analytical school.
Whereas in his earlier writings he
had applied the Freudian theory to
literary and cultural studies, Dr.
Rank published in 1924 a volume
entitled. "The Trauma of Birth," in
which lay the foundation of a new
philosophy in life.
