# Former Farm Students Stage Aerial Stunt Show
## 
### 
Demonstrating the uses and pos
sibilities of various types of planes
at the air show given by the Palo
Alto School of Aviation yesterday,
Lieutenants John Preston and John
Kelly played an important part with
their exhibition of dual plane flying.
The two reserve officers, former
Stanford students, took planes aloft
and gave a demonstration of wing
formation flyingâ€”the two planes fly
ing in line with each other with
about ten feet, separating the wings
of the two ships. After showing the
methods of dual turning, looping,
and shifting positions, the men broke
formation and gave an exhibition of
an aerial dog fight.
