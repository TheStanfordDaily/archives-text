### Mart D'Evelyn 
Unable to stop the Trojan's aec
center and leading conference scor
er, Let-pin' Lee Guttero, Stanford's
basketball five dropped two games
over the week-end to the Univer
sity of Southern California, by 35-40
and 39-29 counts.
Meanwhile in the other confer
ence series California could only di
vide with U.C.L.A., leaving U.S.C.
with an even tighter grip on then
second successive conference title.
Cowing Scores 7
In Los Angeles the Cards found
their high hopes blasted when Gut
tero tanked 15 points Friday night
and 19 on Saturday. In the earlier
game the Cards tied the ball game
but once, at 1 to 1, while the Tro
jans shortly eased away to a heavy
lead, lengthening it to 13 points by
half time. In the second half the
Indians came back with all they had,
but were unable to close in on the
Trojans. Emil Cowing brought up
the Stanford total considerably in
the closing m'nutes by scoring three
field goals in nearly as many min
utes.
Saturday night Stanford was bet
ter set for the improved S.C. quintet.
After Southern California took an
early 11-4 lead, the Cards closed in,
leaving the floor at half time with
but a three-point disadvantage.
With Keith Topping leading the
offense, Coach John Bunn's men
came back with a rush as the
final period opened and tied lip the
score at 20 to 20. Then Guttero
began breaking away and the Tro
jans took a lead which was never
threatened.
Topping led the Cards in scoring
for both games with a combined
total of 16.

Outside of Guttero, it was U.S.C.'s
sensational sophomore guard, Eddi-j
Oram, who gave the Indians then
greatest worry. Oram not only took
the ball off the backboard with regu
larity but broke into the scoring
column with a total of 18 for the
two games.
Tomorrow night the Cards will go
