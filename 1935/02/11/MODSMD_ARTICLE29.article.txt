# Whither Away, Mad Rush of Youth?
## 
### 
The American undergraduate is passing a
ilew milestone iu bis eventful career.
Long has he been accused of being selfish,
self-centered, interested primarily in direct
personal gain and devoid of all thought of his
neighbor's welfare if such thought might lead
lo action which would inconvenience said
you I h.
The gauntlet has been Hung, and he has
been charged with having little or no interest
in public alTairs. He has been said to scorn
politics, to think more of gay parties and
lighter all'airs rather than pause for a moment
to consider the apparent lack of balance in
the modern social order.
Exceptions there are and have been, of
course.
Yet, the rule no longer holds. Newspapers
either shout that the undergraduate is too
active these days, or else they defend him for
the very charge itself.
Young men and women, fresh from pre
paratory school, venture into the collegiate
world today knowing little what lifs ahead.
Ten years ago a diploma meant a great deal.
At least a passport to a good position, a posi
tion that would prove remunerative until the
bearer demonstrated his own unworthiness.
Today, a diploma is something nice to hang
on the wall, if one can all'ord the price of a
suitable frame.
Interesting and true, it is no longer the di
ploma that counts. A youth graduated today
is tossed out into the world to use as best be
may that knowledge which he has gained
through education and experience. His di
ploma indicates nothing beyond the fact that
four years were spent in search of knowledge.
His use of those years is bis own. He may
play or he may learn. A steady, level head
will do both, in good measure, for a balanced
career.
* * *
The world lins expected too much of the
college graduate. America's jwiblic is accus
tomed to looking for leaders and has assumed
that the college man must show the way. The
individual bus not mattered as much as the
idea.
A depression has proved the fallacy of this
contention, yet has served to awaken that
youth to the purpose he serves.
It h;is encouraged him to look at others and
to see himself as an integral part of that social
system which has gotten out of balance be
cause of the lack of interest of the one indi
vidual for the other.
He is looking at the world and at himself.
He is furiously interested in what goes on
around him, and wonders vaguely what lies
ahead.
He is vitally interested in what docs lie
ahead. He will take a thoroughly active part
in the events of tomorrow.

You and I have "come to college." Let us
not lose any part of that opportunity to learn
\\h;il we can of the I'oiVes that are making
history around us todav.

The American undergraduate is passing a
ilew milestone iu bis eventful career.
Long has he been accused of being selfish,
self-centered, interested primarily in direct
personal gain and devoid of all thought of his
neighbor's welfare if such thought might lead

The gauntlet has been Hung, and he has
been charged with having little or no interest
in public alTairs. He has been said to scorn
politics, to think more of gay parties and
lighter all'airs rather than pause for a moment
to consider the apparent lack of balance in
the modern social order.
Exceptions there are and have been, of
course.
Yet, the rule no longer holds. Newspapers
either shout that the undergraduate is too
active these days, or else they defend him for
the very charge itself.
Young men and women, fresh from pre
paratory school, venture into the collegiate
world today knowing little what lifs ahead.
Ten years ago a diploma meant a great deal.
At least a passport to a good position, a posi
tion that would prove remunerative until the
bearer demonstrated his own unworthiness.
Today, a diploma is something nice to hang
on the wall, if one can all'ord the price of a
suitable frame.
Interesting and true, it is no longer the di
ploma that counts. A youth graduated today
is tossed out into the world to use as best be
may that knowledge which he has gained
through education and experience. His di
ploma indicates nothing beyond the fact that
four years were spent in search of knowledge.
His use of those years is bis own. He may
play or he may learn. A steady, level head
will do both, in good measure, for a balanced
career.
