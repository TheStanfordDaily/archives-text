# Improve Fire Protection, Demands Encina Petition
## 
### 
Freshmen living in Encina Hall
yesterday began circulation of a pe
tition asking the administration to
install a more adequate fire protec
tion in the old building.
Many residents of the hall declare
that in many respects it is a fire trap
and not equipped with proper fire
escapes. The petition which is being
circulated reads as follows:
"We, the undersigned residents of
Encina Hall—believing present fire
protection inadequate in our hall—
do hereby petition the Stanford ad
ministration to install more and bet
ter fire escapes in Encina and other
wise improve its defenses against
fire."
