# Let the Candidates Speak
## 
### 
Most of those who dropped around the other
night to hear the candidates for Kx Committee
make their speeches came to laugh and most
of them stayed to laugh. In fact, in a good
natured sort of way, everyone who was there
laughed, including the candidates. II was that
I u nny.
Hut, after all Ihe witticisms and allempled
witticisms (and unconscious witticisms) were

over, there was a feeling by many thai the
plan of letting the students at least see what
sort of representatives they were electing to
office was a good idea. II has possibilities.
Obviously, no candidate could up and
present a complete and intelligent platform in
less than a minute. And if more than a min
ute were allowed, it is very probable that the
candidates would have even more trouble.
For student politics provides no real issues
upon which to base a platform. The best that
we can do and the thing that we should do is
to elect capable and conscientious people to
office who will be willing to consider every
problem that comes up strictly on its merits.
To secure such people we should at least
be given a chance to see what the candidates
look like. A carefully planned, well-publi
cized all-University assembly, not one brought
into being by "discovery," would furnish such
an opportunity.
A thought for the spring elections.
