The sickly-looking green front page of the
Oakland Tribune bathed itself thoroughly in
the most brilliant hue of yellow journalism
last Friday afternoon.
Headlines streamed forth the fact that a
"Stanfohd Yot Tij Kills Self." Papers sold
by the score in Palo Alto. Yet, readers found
the name of the unfortunate person totally
unfamiliar.
Reason: The deceased hod not been a Stan
ford student for some four years, and then
had only been registered here for lino gnarters
in 11)29 and one in IV3I.
Any newspaper that scorns its own sense of
decency to the extent of coloring its headlines
merely to drag some poor individual's name

the results of its own altitude in the field of
outraged readers.
