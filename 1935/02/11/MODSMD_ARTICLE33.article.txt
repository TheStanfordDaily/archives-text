# Oranges and Tomatoes
## 
### 
Orange juice, mister? Or would you prefer
tomato?
A large glass for fifteen cents. A glass, the
same glass, for which one hid adieu to twenty
cents less than a week ago.
And â€”lo and heboid, not only did the price
of orange juice come tumbling down, hut the
glass of tomato juice (nicely chilled, if you
please) came falling after.
The drastic reduction is said to have been
made last Wednesday, tbirtv-six hours before
the most recent Daily editorial asking the
change was written. But two queries ad
dressed to Cellar waiters Friday morning
elicited the response that orange juice was
ten and twenty cents. Well, who.cares?
Today it is fifteen cents. Tomato juice too.
And it is hoped that the I'nion will continue
to make a profit.
