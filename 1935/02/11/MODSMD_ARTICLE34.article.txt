Aerodynamics Professor Elliott G. Reid believes that
| transoceanic travel is a coming major field of aviation,
{ and observes: "At the present time America is far in
| the lead in the development both of sea and land air
) transport craft." He points to some of the important
j 1935 contemplated progress of the Uniled States in this
! branch of aviation relative to the Pacific Ocean:
California-China air service under the initial joint
j operation of a navigation company and Pan-American
| Airways is tentatively scheduled to commence this
I spring. The American-Oriental air route has been
; charted, and a trio of great Martin "flying boats" are
! being built for use in the service.
Pan-American Airways last week asked the
Federal Communications Commission permission
to construct five radio stations in the Pacific Ocean
prior to the establishment of transpacific air
service. Directional aeronautical radio stations,
with a beam of IXOO miles each, arc planned at
Alameda, Kancohe Bay in the Hawaiian Islands,
the Midway group. Wake Island, and Guam in the
Marianas.
j Soon a Sikorsky seaplane from the Pan-American
j base at Miami, Florida, will be brought to the West
I Coast as a pilot training ship. Alameda will be a Cali
fornia terminal and five .«stops will be made in the
j Pacific along the proposed route: Hawaii, Midway
| Island, Wake Island, Guam and Manila.
As soon as the kidnaping trial is over, Colonel Charles
i A. Lindbergh, who in company with Mrs. Lindbergh
| did pioneering work on the Pacific air route in 1931,
j is expected to conduct preliminary trial flights over Ihe
1 projected route. Ho will probably fly the Pioneer
JClipper, a 42-passenger, multimotored transoceanic
plane.
The longest leg of the route is from the mainland
i of the United States to Hawaii, a distance of 2400 miles,
j which Amelia Earhart soloed in eighteen hours, but
1 which record the Pioneer Clipper will no doubt eclipse.
! The Pioneer Clipper is a sister-ship of the famous
' record-holding Brazilian Clipper, technically known
' as the Sikorsky S-42 type. The Pioneer Clipper is
capable of a nonstop flight of 3000 miles with 12 pas
j sengers, a crew of five and a ton of mail.
The proposed route will inaugurate, it is estimated,
60-hour service between California and China, and
link existing airlines of North, South and Central
America with Asia.
Atlantic air service has been a proven success for
many years. The Graf Zepplin has made 71 trans
atlantic crossings from Friedrichshafen to Pernambuco
in the last four years without mishap, carrying 10.000
passengers.
"Atmospheric conditions for the greater portion of
j the year render the Pacific Ocean less hazardous for
I aerial travel than the Atlantic Ocean," states Professor
i Reid. "A great deal of work remains in charting ocean
| air-currents, since we know very little as yet about
j the winds at high altitudes over any of the: oceans.
"The next important development in transport
flying will he aircraft designed to carry on route
operations at altitudes much higher than those
now utilized. Flights at a height of the order of
30,000 feet afford much swifter and safer air travel,
hut supercharged passenger cabins, in which at
least two-thirds of sea level air pressure can be
artificially maintained, will have to be developed
for such aircraft because passenger comfort at
i high altitudes can be insured in no other way,
| "Regular air transport service across both Ih'>
Atlantic and Pacific Oceans will undoubtedly be es
tablished within the next decade," concludes Professor
Reid. "I will be very much surprised if both lighter
and heavier than aircraft are not used wifh success
on these routes."
