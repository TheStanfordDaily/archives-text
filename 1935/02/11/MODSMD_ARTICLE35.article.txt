i Emily Post divides all of human
kind into those who eat peas with a
knife and those who don't. The
clergy divides people into those who
; have sinned, and those who have
never had a chance. The undertak- ;
! ers divide people into those who are
t doddering, and those who are too
I healthy for good business.
Whether they belong there or
not, people are put into categories j
I —just for the sake of convenience,
j 'I hey are classified ".ccording to j
the size of their collars, the bulge
of (heir craniums, the wiggle of
! their hips, etc.
j i
With due humility, we suggestj
i another classification. People (es- j
J pocially Stanford people) are di- 1
I vided into those who take everything |
| personally, and those who take
i nothing personally. This is probably
! a very superficial division, and uu- ;
doubtedly harks back to differences
| in cephalic indexes, conditional re- '
; flexes, and internal juices. But for ;
one who must dart in between brick- j
j bats and bouquets, it is a very, very
' handy grouping.
There are some persons on this
| campus, as elsewhere, who take
i every word of condemnation as a
personal affront. The condemnation j
may be directed at a locust plague,
a mass movement of Siberian lem- j
mings, or the size of cobblestones in
! the roadbed of a proposed transcon
| rinental subway. And they will feel
j offended. They feel intuitively that j
! an "attack" on anything is a veiled i
j body-blow at their own intellectual 1
1 honesty, moral stature, or family |
j tree.
The antithetical group—as may be
I suspected—is just the opposite. An .
1 article may gently jibe at people i
I who are uppy, or at people who are j
I much too downy, or at people who ;
j confuse a high fever with patriotism, 1
or at people. And this "take nothing
personally" group will smile approv- j
I ingly. You can denounce the whole
human race (which must include
them), and as long as you refrain j
from mentioning their individual
names they do not know that they
are under fire, or even gently sim- |
mering.

This latter group is destined for
j a life of sweet contentment. Re
moved from the troubles of the
; world, such ones will live to a ripe ;
and mushy old age.
The others, who go off in high \
I dudgeon at an attack on the moral
I integrity of titmice, are destined to
j a life of eternal itchiness.
Alas!
