Students who will come in contact
with Stravinsky and his music
Thursday night for the first time
will have no adequate conception of
the man and his work, because first
it is necessary to know the orches
tral Stravinsky. This is perfectly fea
sible today with the magnificent re
cordings of his symphonic works
that are available. Several of these
recordings, old and new, uill be used
at the lecture tomorrow afternoon
on "Stravinsky, the Man, and His
Work," by Warren D. Allen, in room
84, at 4:15 o'clock.
The program will begin with
two great pre-war compositions,
"The Firebird" -Mid "The Rite of
Spring," and selections from the
satirical composition inspired by
the war. entitled the "Story of a
Soldier."
The chief interest in tomorrow
afternoon's work will be the playing
of ihe two new albums which bring
to us recordings of one of the num
bers that i.s to be played on Thurs
day night's program and also the tre
mendously virile work known as
"The Country Wedding."
The first is Duo Concertante as
played by Mr. Dushkin and Stra
vinsky himself. Even with the slen
der medium of violin and piano, the
composer knows his uncanny faculty
for instrumentation and for know
ing the exact effect desired from the
particular instrument. His use of the
piano as a percussion instrument
against the pizzicato of the violin is
; particularly effective, and the whole
j work, which is really a suite con
j sisting of very short movements, is
piquant and fascinating to a degree.
"The Country Wedding" is pro
nounced by many to he the finest
, tiling Stravinsky has done. Ilis
genius is here seen at its best. The
J work is presented by soloists and
chorus with an orchestra consist
ing entirely of percussion instru
ments: piano, cympani, xylophone,
etc. The thematic material is
j strongly suggestive of the Russian
folk idiom and the health}', vig
orous rhythms are truly infec
tious. This work marks a high point
| not only in composition, but in
reproduction.
