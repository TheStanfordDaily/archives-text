# FIGHTING FATHER COUGHLIN
## 
### JOHN L. KLINE 
(Second of a series on Father |
Coughlin, radio priest, this article !
deals mainly with the recent por- I
tions of his career, some of his '
policies i\nd statements.)
A million and a quarter letters I
followed a Coughlin speech entitled
"Hoover Prosperity Means a New |
War." Six hundred thousand came
in after another anti-G.O.P. speech.
"Nominate Morgan, Mellon, Mills,
and Meyer as the Four Horseman of
the Apocalypse." For several years, i
his average per week has exceeded i
80,000 communications—the largest
mail of anyone in the U.S.
His personal popularity has its!
monetary corollary. Although he |
sometimes banks $20,000 in one-dol
lar bills, no breath of scandal as to
misuse of funds touches the father. |
His only extravagance has been the |
erection of a magnificent new church,
costing $750,000, opened within the
last year. His private offices are in I
the top stories. Here he has living i
quarters and a phone for outgoing '
use only. j
When funds fell oIT sometime
ago, he had only to suggest that i
he might have to discontinue his j
work, and the flood came in »new. |
Government silver lists showed j
Coughlin's secretary as holding;
500,000 ounces of silver —largest in
Michigan—at a time when he was |
saying over the radio: ''The restora- j
tion of silver to its proper value is of (
Christian concern. I send you a call !
for the mobilization of Christianity j
against the God of gold."
He answered questioners that he
had merely allied himself with the j
President in anticipating an in- j
crease in the price of silver. Such
deals are made for his organization. 1
The father himself lives simply, not !
even paying an income tax.
In 1932 the broadcasting priest pre
dicted that both Democrats and Re- j
publicans would disappear within |
twelve years. Nevertheless, he was j
a rabid New-Dealer, supporting the j
Administration until last summer, i
when he drifted awfiy from F.R. ;
How close the good father was to |
the President is unknown—some sus
pect it was very, but evidence is
lacking.
Some observers felt that Cough
lin knew about the closing of the
banks and dropping of the gold
standard before the moves were
made. Ilis actions seem to show
that he knew Detroit's big First
National would close. Such guesses
never get very far since the father

is exceedingly close-mouthed and
likes to appear enigmatic.
About a year ago Coughlin's re
covery formula was a public works
program to give work at a mini
mum of $1500 a year to every man
who was unable to find a place in
industry. Recently his ideas seem to
be growing more radical, and his at
tacks more violent. Although he still
professes to be a New Dealer, he
has been most disparaging about
F.R. in private remarks.
At present Coughlin's ideas are
linked up with his plan of a Na
tional League for Social Justice.
Before details were publicized, he
spoke of a national lobby of 5,000,-
000 people. His newest —and more
ambitious—plan calls for local units,
then congressional district units to
elect delegates to state conventions.
These would send representatives to
a nation-wide convention, where
policies of the organization could be
further formulated.
Opponents say 12 of the 16
planks he suggests for the league
have been taken directly from
Farmer-Labor platforms. Be that
as it may, here are the 16:
(1) Liberty of conscience and edu
cation; (2) a living wage; (3) na
tionalization of banking, currency,
and natural resources; (4X other pri
vately owned property; (5) all prop
erty controlled for public good;
(6) government banking; (7) con
gressional coinage control; (8) steady
currency value.
(9) Agriculture to receive cost of
production plus fair value; (10) gov
ernment protection of labor unions;
(11) recall of non-productive bonds;
(12) abolition of tax-free bonds;
(13) social taxation; (14) simplifica
tion of government; (15) conscrip
tion of wealth in wartime; (16)
human rights over property rights.
These planks can be interpreted
to mean a great deal, or almost
nothing; they are exceedingly
vague. As we shall Inter note, in
comprehensibility is an earmark
of this praying demagogue.
His platform mentions neither free
speech, nor democratic government.
His listeners asked for no such omis
sions, possibly do not even notice the
lack: but it is a significant feature
of his program, with many and ob
vious ramifications.
CBS and NBC have not been
over-friendly to Coughlin's broad
casts. The former wanted to "con
trol" his talks; the latter would not
even let him on their chain. So the

father has set up his own indepen
dent system, using telephone wires
and independent stations. $14,000 a
| week is paid out for the 26 stations
now emplpyed. This cost, as well as
! his office expenses, and a good deal
of charity work is maintained by
contributions.
The last article tomorrow will
! consider the personality of this
social - minded man-of-the-cloth,
j his position, and future prospects.
