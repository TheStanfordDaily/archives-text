Clubmen (jive Way
In the first half of the game the l

of the offensive, play being mostly in j
Stanford territory. Superior condi- j
tion began to tell, however, and to- j
ward the end of the game the older i
Clubmen began to give way.

the Olympics. "Scotchy" Campbell j
had taken a dribbling rush near the '
Card goal and fallen on the ball !
over the line to tally for the Club.j
but (he extra point kick was wide.

right wing, tallied the winning j
points toward the piiddie of the hail j

intei-cepted a Club lateral on his j
