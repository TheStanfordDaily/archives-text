# U.S.F. Frosh Team Trims Papoose Five
## 
### Gordon Frost 
j San Francisco University's frosh
'basketball team achieved what local
'hoop enthusiasts considered impos-j
i sible Friday nightâ€”they defeated
I the unbeaten Stanford freshmen,
1 30-28.
Friday's game was a heart
breaking ordeal for the frosh. 11
: times winners this season and
touted by many as the best frosh
team in hoop circles.
A final burst of Don speed when
1 nine minutes were left to play ac- !
i tually accounted for the victory. I
' Diminutive Card Guard H. B. Lee j
J had just left the game on fouls with j
! Stanford leading 28-24 when Gus j
i Scheppler and Ed Worthington, for- j
j wards, and Sal Seeno, center, play- ;
J ing fast and furious ball, made the!
score 28 all. Then, with two minutes ;
j before the final gun, Worthington ,
j dribbled in and shot a beautiful J
j set-up.
Earlier in the c.vening Clarencc j
: Maurer, Stanford high scorer with j
! 10 points gained, and Dick Lyon, j
I center, started activities by sinking I
i one apiece to give the papooses a j
; four-point lead. The remaining part
lof the first half saw both teams:
j build up their scores equally until :
j just before the rest time U.S.F. took i
! the lead. The score stood 18-14 be
| tween periods.
Hank Luisctti who has averaged
j 20 points per game was "off" l ri- ;
< day, making but f> points.
This afternoon Coach Jimmie
Bradshaw plans to work his men ]
lightly for their second "Little Big J
i Game" with California frosh to be i
played at Berkeley tomorrow night.
