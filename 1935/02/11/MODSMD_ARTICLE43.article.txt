## BASEBALL, BASKETBALL TEAMS NOT SO MUCH

Just a panoramic picture of Stan
ford's week-end activity on the field
of sport:
The Stanford baseball team is bid
ding to follow the basketball quin
tet's lead—the Indians started line, (
but they have been slipping until <
now they look less impressive than j
they did in their first game.
Against San Jose State things
went smoothly until the seventh in
ning; Stanford led 2 to 0, and both
pitching and infield work were air
tight. Then came the seventh, and
six runs for San Jose. A brief bat
ting show in the last half of that
period put the Indians back into the
game, but errors did the trick for the j
Spartans.
Attitude is the factor that has made
Stanford look bad in the past few
games; everyone has been working
for himself, and there has been little '
trace of team work. That's just one j
of the slight difficulties in a system
where the first three-quarters of 1
the schedule is spent in throat-cut- j
ting for the first string berths.
