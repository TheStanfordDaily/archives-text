# SUCCESS PROVED TOO MUCH FOR FRESHMEN
## 
### 
Stanford basketballers also looked
much better in the first U.S.C. series j
than they did over the past week- j
end. The squad has looked really •
impressive three times this year: in j
the second Trojan game of the sea
son, against Santa Clara, and against
San Francisco University.

The trouble is, Stanford has won j
nearly all her non-conference \
games, and California has lost
j many of her games to the same i
teams that have fallen before
Stanford, but the Bears have al
ready beaten John Bunn's Cardi- '
nals twice, and look like they can
do it a couple more times.
The frosh had their troubles also. |
llt seems they went the way of so j
many inexperienced freshman teams
and got a bit over-cocky. San Fran- ;
! cisco's yearlings stopped the Cards':
undefeated string rather effectively, j
30 to 28. The Stanford players I
i seemed cross-eyed when aiming at
the basket, and even high-scoring
Hank, Luisetti was contented with
'six small digits.
