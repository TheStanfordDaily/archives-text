# RUGGERS, SWIMMERS SAVE STANFORD'S FACE
## 
### 
The rugby fifteens, both first and ;
second teams, showed their same old [
I style, although the varsity was!
somewhat bewildered by the cool, j
1 clever game put up by an experi- i
l enced, though fairly slow, Olympic i
Club team. Johnny Reisner looked |
like an Ail-American again, and Ray
| Lewis could match himself with any
! of the placement kickers. j

The Clubmen had things much
their own way during the early
stages of play, but Stanford came
back with a penalty kick from a
difficult angle and a long, speedy
75-yard spurt for a try from Reisner.
Final score, 8 to 3.
Stanford's swimmers, humiliated j
by the powerful Golden Gate J.C.
but a week ago, came back with a ;
decisive well-rounded show againstj
the Lakeside Swimming Club to j
win, 53 to 24, after taking all but two |
of the first places.
