## 
### 
Taking first place in every event j
except the 150-yard backstroke and
100-yard free-style, Stanford swim
mers Saturday swamped Lakeside;
Athletic Club of Oakland 59-24.
In most of the events the Indian j
paddlers merely loafed down the j
stretches while the Oakland boys j.
fought hard to make a good show- j
ing in second place. Chief disap
pointment to the spectators was the i
absence of Rufus Rusker, Oaklander,!
who had been counted on to present
real competition for Tom Boothe in
a diving duel. As it was, Boothe won |
his event hands down.

divided among Boothe, Hoover, }
Foster, Scatena and Clemo. Stan
ford won both the relay events.
