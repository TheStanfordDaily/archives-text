# SAN JOSE SCORES SIX RUNS TO WIN IN WILD SEVENTH
## 
### 
Seventh-inning San Jose' batting
strength and seventh-inning fielding
and pitching weakness gave the San
: Jose State Teachers a 6 to 5 practice
game victory over the Indian base
ball team Saturday afternoon.
The Spartans swatted Johnny
Campbell for three hits and were
awarded a couple of walks and
bases on error as six of the men
from the county seat came trundling
across the plate during the night
marish seventh, the only ining that
j furnished San Jose a score.
j Both teams played erratic base
ball, Stanford being scored with six
errors and the Spartans getting four
miscues.
Co-captain Fred Heringer was
well on the way toward a shut-out
: game when he was relieved at the
i close of the sixth. Although he al
lowed five hits during the early in
nings, he was never in trouble, and
he succeeded in scattering the San
Jose safeties well.
I Stanford scored in the second and
i again in the sixth when Gordy Mal
latratt got two bases on an error and
came home on a single by Jim Wool
: ley. The Indians scored three times
in the seventh after loading the
bases; one came in on error, and a
single by Red Holman ushered two
i more Cardinal runners home.
