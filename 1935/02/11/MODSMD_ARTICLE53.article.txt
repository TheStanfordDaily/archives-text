## HEARST AND DESTRUCTION 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
My reaction to what Mr. Hearst j
has offered us is .acute compared to i
your wild reply. Possibly, you are j
over the proverbial barrel.
Those who realize the fallacy of j
Mr. Heart's stand probably realize !
also the ineffectiveness of their own j
position. They know that he enjoys I
an all-pervasive power, and that j
educational institutions, by not rec- !
ognizing their social responsibility j
or their rightful role in interpreting
social values, offer no effective
opposition.
Those who see the truth realize,
possibly that Mr. Hearst is creating j
an artificial antagonism that only j
helps to destroy intellectual liberal- j
ism. An even more significant fact '
is that whatever our own stand on |
Mr. Hearst, whatever our likes and 1
dislikes or beliefs and disbeliefs, his- '

Tory will follow its natural course.
Whether the stand of Mr. Hearst
is a sincere or hypocritical one makes
little difference: Its effects are equal
ly destructive.
I am aware of the ineffectiveness
of my stand, but I have two consola
tions: one, that I haven't the task of
convincing Americans that they aro
free; the other, that Mr. Hearst's
doctrine breeds the germs of its own
destruction. \
—Gordon Beebe.
