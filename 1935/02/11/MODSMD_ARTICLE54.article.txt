# FLAYS WOMEN'S COUNCIL
## 
### 
I The Editor, Sir:
| f think f would x'ather spend a
i week in the city jail than appear for
i five minutes before Stanford's su
; percilious, high-toned Women's
i Council. Couldn't a new policy be
! introduced whereby one is shown I
the courtesy of being treated with a
certain degree of respect and affa- :
bility, even though one has parked
j in a yellow zone. The present meth- i
! od is nothing short of primitive in- ,
! quisition.
! The compulsory formality of an j
| officer of the law would be much J
I more becoming than the attitude of
j contempt and superiority of which j
I members of the Women's Council are j
guilty. I trust I have not offended
j anyone. The Women's Council raem
i bers have such a good opinion of
j themselves that I'm sure they can
take mine with equanimity.
â€”An Offender.
