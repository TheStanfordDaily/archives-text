# Faculty, Student Spokesmen Favor Politics Discussion
## Explanation of Communism, Fascism Requested By Students 
### Cedric Larson 
Students and faculty spokesmen
joined last night in favorable reac
tion to a student-proposed project
of an all-University program for the
campus in discussion of current
trends of political thought.
Complete presentation of the phil
osophies of communism and fascism
was asked by a group of students
who communicated their opinions to
the Daily, with the idea of having
Stanford take a lead in maintaining
academic freedom.
Advocated by Wilbur
Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur feels that
such a discussion would prove quite
acceptable if a satisfactory program
could be well worked out in advance,
with an intelligent presentation of
these topics.
Economics Professor Theodore
Boggs feels such a discussion
would be a good thing if properly
sponsored, so that students might
form a more intelligent opinion
of the meaning of fascism and
communism. .
Sociology Professor Richard La
Piere said if these doctrines were
discussed before students by capable
persons, meetings would no doubt
be beneficial and be well attended
Students Interested
Economics Instructor William
Hopkins stated he noted student
opinion running high in such doc
trines as fascism and communism,
and a meeting with these subjects as
discussion topics would draw con
siderable interest.
Executive Committee Members
Woody Adams and Sam Lee and
other student leaders felt a uni
versity sponsored presentation of
these topics would meet with con
siderable interest and prove of
value.
Spotlights of publicity have been
playing lately upon charges and
counter charges ofco mmunism, fas
cism and other brands of political
thought rampant here, there, and
everywhere. More heat than light
has been generated by arguments
bandied about as to the worth of
this or that doctrine, and a dispas
sionate discussion of the issues in
volved in each political philosophy
would do much to clarify the at
mosphere.
Terms Not Understood
Most people today are in some
thing of a fog as to the real mean
ing of fascists and communists. Every
disaffected or unemployed indivi
dual is eyed askance as a potential
bolshevik, and every employer s
fascist.
William Henry Chambc. lin, the
authority on Russian affairs, drew
a record crowd at a Tuesday eve
ning lecture a short while ago, show
ing the interest on the campus in
current political experiments.
A well-planned university pro
gram or programs on current politi
cal philosophies would be backed up
by general student interest and bear
administration endorsement.
