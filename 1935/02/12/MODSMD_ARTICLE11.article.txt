## 
### 
Classes will be —or should be—
j dismissed on Thursday, when Chap
| pie's Faculty number comes out, ac
| cording to Editor Gordon Steedman.
' When teacher finds out what the
[ Hammer and Coffin kiddies have j
! said about teacher, she will burst!
I crying from the room, leaving her
; apples behind her.
The campus will resound to the
j happy laughter of Chappie and the
■ kiddies, and the Chappies will sing I
j the old Hammer and Cacaphonous
song: "We laugh and we jest, but
| what we like best is to jump down
I the faculty's throat."
Dug up by the Chappie Expedi
| tion to the G'by desert are valuable
! manuscripts containing brilliant
I statements of faculty members.
Art Editor Gist has contributed a
, different and a striking-the-gongi.ng j
cover depicting a well-known cam
pus scene.
Says Steedman: "More than the
i usual amount of better than usual
i short jokes and gags are promised. 1
j All for a small 15 cents —the tenth j
! part of a dollar plus the 20th part of
I a dollar plus the 100 th part of a
dollar for sales tax."
