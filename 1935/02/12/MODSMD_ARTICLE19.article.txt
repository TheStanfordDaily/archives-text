# THEATER PLANS UP FOR FINAL CONSIDERATION
## Ex Committee May Approve Design in Closed Meet Tonight 
### 
For the first time this year Ex
Committee tonight will hold an ex
ecutive session. A.S.S.U. President

(if several important matters, in
cluding New Theatre plans, will not
be interrupted.
There is a possibility that by to-,
morrow final plans for the New
Theatre will be approved, and an
important step towards the early
construction of the structure
taken.
Revised plans have been made by
the University'architects on the rec
ommendation of the New Theatre
Committee. These plans will be
submitted to the members of the
New Theatre Committee this after
noon, and any action taken by them
will be considered by Ex Committee
tonight, and probably acted upon.
Now that the 15 cents is definitely
back home with The Daily editorial
budget, all that the Ex Committee
has to decide is the question of
where the unspent portion goes.
Seven voting members of Ex Com
mittee said the surplus should re
vert to the A.S.S.U. Two voting
members said it should stay with
The Daily. If Bill Stark reverts to

nitely leave the money where it
is.
Another important job of Ex
Committee will be the canvassing
of today's election results.
Ex Committee will lose three of
its hardy veterans of many a cam
paign after tonight's meeting: Chuck
Glasgow, Woody Adams, and Sammy
