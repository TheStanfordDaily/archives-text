# Daily Votes Today for New Editor
## Chappell, Hamilton, and Jacobs Seek Post 
### 
After three strenuous years of
pounding typewriters, whipping out
copy paper, and meeting deadlines,'
Charles Chappell, Francis Hamilton,
and Julius Jacobs are before the
voters of The Daily staff today in the
semi-annual staff elections.
Surviving the weeding-ouf proc
ess of many successive staff promo
tions, Chappell and Hamilton have
risen to the rank of associate edi
tors and Jacobs has risen to the po
sition of managing editor.
Face Final Choice
They now face the final weeding
out. One of the men will become
editor, the other two will join the
famous list of defeated candidates.
More important in the mind of
staff members than the A.S.S.U.
elections, the staff election will be
held in the editorial offices of The
Daily this afternoon between one
and three o'clock. John Brock,
A.S.S.U. election chairman, will be
in charge.
Promotions Scheduled
Attendant to the Daily elections
are the staff promotions. There will
be changes in the staff all down the
line: associate editors, managing
editors, women's editor, night edi
tors, department heads, and copy
editors.
These are determined by the Edi
torial Board, whose members cast
their ballots with Brock first, and
then retire to another room to make
the promotions. The list of the pro
motions and the results of the elec
tion ai'e then posted simultaneously.
