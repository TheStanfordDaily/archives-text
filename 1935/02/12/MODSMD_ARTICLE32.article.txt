# Stanford Steps Forth With the Winds of Freedom
## 
### 
While students and faculty at many a con
temporary institution find themselves bewil
dered by the onslaught of propaganda for or
against current political and economic "phi
losophies," several Stanford people busied
themselves, saw the handwriting on the Uni
versily seal, and recalled that
"The Winds of Freedom Arc HI owing"

For Stanford, whether or not you and I
realize the fact, is one of the most liberal of
American educational centers.
Dr. Kay Lvman W ilbur, as president of the
t'niversity, endeavors to see that students and
faculty alike enjoy the same opportunity to
say and do what they please as long as those
words and actions are not beyond the pale
of good taste.
Dr. Wilbur, one of America's leading edu
cators, is a man who understands young
people and who likes to talk with them, to
know what they are thinking and doing. He
enjoys helping them when the opportunity
oilers. II you don't believe it, drop in at his
Administration Building office for a friendly
chat yourself. He'll be glad to see you.

There has been so much unsound, wild
talk of communism, el al., in relation to the
college campus, that some students have been
aroused to inquire into the facts as to what
those different concepts of government really
stand for.
Inquiry and discussion have considered the
possibility of an all-University assembly that
could treat the question in full. Stanford's
informed faculty members, willing to co-op
crate, would prepare a thorough presentation
of available knowledge, treating each philoso
phy from the historical, economic, political,
and social aspects.
The program, in answer to a student de
mand, would find a warm response. In all
probability the questions could not be han
dled adequately in one hour. The morning a 11-
I'piversitv affair could be followed by one or
Iwo evening discussions in series.
In fitting conclusion, after the foreign forms
have been analyzed and explained in detail, it
would be well to consider the fact that even
these United States possess a very definite
political philosophy. We who are close to it,
having grown up with it, accept it as "some
thing that is."
Why not contrast if, considering its advan
tages and weaknesses, with the revolutionary
doctrines of the isms'!

Mauvie Kahn, A.S.S.U. president, declares
that it is an excellent plan, and that Kx Com
mittee will discuss the possibilities tonight.
A morning conference of students and fac
ulty is expected to result in the drafting of a
tentative program which will be taken up
I hen.
II will he interesting to watch Stanford lake
the lead in enlightening student thought on
llicse matters in o purely objective prcsenin
lion.
It will be an experiment in education, aris
ing out of the desire of the students them
selves to learn, and one that will tell the world
that al Stanford we look for the facts.
