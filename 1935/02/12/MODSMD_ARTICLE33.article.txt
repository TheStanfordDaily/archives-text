fluey Long, that political whirlwind I'roin
Louisiana, surprises the world and touches on
very tender subjects when he sticks his nose
into asserted graft in other people's domains.
This time he has introduced a resolution
iu Congress demanding an investigation of
"Sunny Jim" Farley, the Administration's No.
1 gravy disher. He wants "general and specific
acts of irregularity, dishonesty, and other ac
tivity" on the part of the Postmaster (icnernl
looked into.
We might laugh if it were not hv now so
tiresome to hear ahout the puffing plavhov.
Any man who has a record and reputation like
Long's most certainly h;is no place in suggest
ing moves toward other departments.
Yet, the Farley prohe, il every actually
brought to a head which is politically im

practical would possibly prove quite inter
esting.
Ami, of course, a probe could be started in
Louisiana . . . and, of course, the last ad
ministration, which departed from Washing
ton in 1933, was rumored to have just about
"had the goods" on the unhappy Kingfish . . .
Hut a new administration might have mis
placed those goods.
