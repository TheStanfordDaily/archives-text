# Paging the Board of Equalization
## 
### 
The tale of the State Hoard of Equalization
is a sad one, and the additional chapters that
are written from day to day continue the
same despondent note of blissful ignorance.
It is difficult to conceive just how the
Hoard's members, politically able enough to
retain their offices year in and year out,
should be so miserably incompetent in mat
ters of civil procedure.
Last week the Hoard revoked certain liquor
licenses in the city of San Francisco without
giving the license holders benefit of hearing.
The courts have already ruled this action il
legal nnd the liquor men blithely reopen shop
and thumb their noses at the Hoard.
It becomes more obvious daily that with
the duties that have lately devolved upon it,
a liberal stocking of intelligent administrators
is needed on the Hoard of Equalization. Elec
tion lime is far away, but we trust the voters
will not forget.
