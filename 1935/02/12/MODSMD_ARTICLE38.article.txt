### CEDRIC LARSON 
One hundred and twenty-six years ago today
Lincoln, America's sixteenth president, was born in a
rude farm cabin in Kentucky.
His youth was spent amid a country then pretty
much of a howling wilderness, and it would have
seemed incredible to any of his early acquaintances that
he would rise one day to a position of eminence.
But Lincoln had idealistic purpose, combined with
tenacity, insight and a kindly sense of humor. These
qualities carried him from one position of public trust
to another, until, as preserver of the Union, after he
had at length subdued the Confederacy in the War for
Southern Independence, he was struck down by an
assassin's bullet on April 14, 1865.
Professor Edgar E. Robinson, history department
head, believes that Lincoln stood primarily for the
ideals of American social democracy. He points out
that a direct result of the World War has been a
renewed interest in Americanism, and that one phase
of this is the heightened regard for such national
heroes as Lincoln.
In his recent study, Lincoln and Americanism,"
Professor Robinson says of the Civil War president:
"No American leader has done more to make
American democracy mean a social heritage of
priceless worth (than Lincoln.) America stands
today almost alone of great peoples in its beliefs
in liberty of conscience, freedom of speech and of
press, and the high importance of equality of oppor
tunity. Lincoln did valiant service in making it so.
"Lincoln was not typical of his generation. But he
was, I think, typical of the leaders that have given
American democracy the virtues that it has. He drew
his Americanism from the soil of Middle America
that made .his career what it was. It was ihe triumph
of one of the common people, who knew the simple
life that was characteristic of ari agricultural civili
zation.
"Lincoln as the outstanding exponent of Amer
ican democracy seemed to build his life and to
govern his thought with an abiding faith that the
impulse to equality was an enduring passion of
Americans. A free acceptance of that fact is neces
sary before thought—sustained, honest, creative
thought—may again make Americanism a hope
for a better civilization."
At the end of seven decades which have elap.sed
since his death, the figure of Lincoln stands out with
increasing .sharpness from the pale crowd of political
nonentities of his day, many of whom were his bitter
est enemies. Lincoln lacked no end of detractors and
active foes when he was at the height of his power
but he out-lived, out-thought and out-died all of
them.
