# Kefauver Is KGO Speaker

The relation of the educational
program to Americanism was the
subject which Grayson N. Kefauver,
dean of the School of Education,
presented to the Stanford Hour radio
audience over station KGO at 8
o'clock last night.
He enlarged upon the point that
the need for making the education
al program more vital in developing
a sound Americanism has become
evident in the past few years.
"The educational progi'am in every
country reflects to some degree the
cultural interests of the people. The
dominant social aspirations not only
provide the basis for the support of
the educational program but they
also condition the educational poli
cies which are adopted."
Dean Kefauver continued, "The
development of a democracy in this
country with general concern for
the maximum development of all the
people and the desire that there be
participation on the part of all in
shaping social policy have caused a
more extensive program of educa
tion to be developed in the United
States than in any other country of
the world."
If sufficient social understanding
can be developed, then desirable
social changes can be made, violent
revolution can be avoided, and
demagogues will experience greater
difficulty in securing support for
their impractical schemes;* is the
conclusion reached by Dean Ke
fauver.
