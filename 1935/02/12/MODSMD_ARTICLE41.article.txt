"LIVES OF A BENGAL LANCER"
At Stanford Theatre
A sweeping, thrilling action film
set in the desert borderlands of
India, where Britain's crack regi
ment of cavalry is suppressing an in
surrection. The colonel, a crusty
old fellow and a
d i s c i p linarian,
regrets that his
boy is stationed
under him, and
makes the lad
feel it. Young j
Stone (Dick
Cromwell) falls
for the bewitching daughter of the
rebel chieftain, and is captured. It
is then up to Gary Cooper and i
Franchot Tone, comrades of his, to
break camp and rescue him. Their
blowing up of the enemy arsenal is !
by far the most breathtaking scene
| the movies have given us. Cooper
well suggests the sort of fellow who j
helps build an empire, and he is
particularly fine in his emotional |
scenes. Tone shows himself to be the j
adept comedian he hitherto gave
promise of becoming. C. Aubrey
Smith and Sir Guy Standing, com
manding officers, are at their British
bests. Hathaway's direction is with
out. noticeable Haw, either in the
amazing panoramas or in the inti
-1 mate touches which distinguish the
j piece. —Lowe.

"GRAND OLD GIRL" and
"WHEN A MAN'S A MAN"
j At the Varsity
May Robson is, of course, the
] whole show in "Grand Old Girl."
1 Neither piquant Mary Carlisle nor
! Alan Hale give a great deal of com
| petition, but Robson makes the pic
] ture, if not great, at least good en-
I tertainment.
The plot concerns a beloved old
high school principal who takes time
i off from reforming her young
j charges to dabble in political graft.
1 She buys a confectionery, learns to

shoot craps, and finally recovers her
position through the intervention of
the President of the United States, a
former pupil. Trite, but well done
I and almost convincing.
George O'Brien stars in a Harold
Bell Wright westerner. Fine for ten
! year-olds and those who like
; westerns.
—Whitmore.

Crop dusting by airplane is ex
tensively carried on in cotton fields
of the South.
