1 AMATEUR FOOTBALL A
I PROFITABLE OCCUPATION

| Amateur football, even when kept
|on a strictly amateur scale, is quite
i profitable. A rather obvious state
|ment, no doubt, but it has its into
j nations and insinuations.
For the individual who is a real
I star, the publicity and fame
gained in college football alone
are enough to set him up for sev-
I erij years, without his having to
rely on education, ability, or any-
I thing else for a livelihood. Atfd
still lie is an amateur.
I Bobby Grayson, for example, has
another year of college football, and
if he finishes the 1935 season with a
: fifth of the public notice he re
| ceived last fall, he will spend the
! remainder of the year tui'ning down
i offers for this and that.
Grayson has already been con
i tacted in regard to professional box
i ing and wrestling, neither of which
; activities he has ever participated
; in, and the offers have been highly
; inviting.

PUBLICITY MEANS
BREAD AND BUTTER

Which brings us to the point that
i for a crack athlete publicity is just
Iso much bread and butter. Each
little headline and comment in a
j sports writer's column is just one
! more step towards a good coaching
job or other offer, or it brings in
just one more chance to sign a
1 testimonial.
So headlines and huge sports
page spreads, to the really out
standing athlete, do not have the
effect of making that individual
disgustedly conceited as it would
so many high school stars. But
! he views each bit of publicity ob
jectively, much in the same man
ner as a photographer looks upon
1 a "credit line." m
Publicity is more apt to "go to
the head" of a second rate athlete
in college than to a star. This second
stringer has no particular intention
of capitalizing on his sport, and ho
frequently will swell up when he
sees his name in a paper.
Cotton Warburton of Southern
California recently'signed with the
Chicago Bears, national professional
football team. Warburton rode
through his senior year at S.C. with
nothing but his sophomore and jun
ior reputation, and when he finished
his competition, he was still con
sidered a prize by the professionals.
i
Stanford and California will open
boxing hostilities tomorrow night in
'■ the pavilion. The two always make
quite a bloody mixture of it in most
any athletic combat, but particularly
ure they out for blood when they
come across a sport where that is the
object.
Stanford's team ■will be made up
. mostly of the All-University win
ners, and this year's Indian team is
stronger than usual. The Bears also
j will have some power. —Browne.

BREAD AND BUTTER

Which brings us to the point that
i for a crack athlete publicity is just
Iso much bread and butter. Each
little headline and comment in a
j sports writer's column is just one
! more step towards a good coaching
job or other offer, or it brings in
just one more chance to sign a
1 testimonial.
So headlines and huge sports
page spreads, to the really out
standing athlete, do not have the
effect of making that individual
disgustedly conceited as it would
so many high school stars. But
! he views each bit of publicity ob
jectively, much in the same man
ner as a photographer looks upon
1 a "credit line." m
Publicity is more apt to "go to
the head" of a second rate athlete
in college than to a star. This second
stringer has no particular intention
of capitalizing on his sport, and ho
frequently will swell up when he
sees his name in a paper.
Cotton Warburton of Southern
California recently'signed with the
Chicago Bears, national professional
football team. Warburton rode
through his senior year at S.C. with
nothing but his sophomore and jun
ior reputation, and when he finished
his competition, he was still con
sidered a prize by the professionals.

Stanford and California will open
boxing hostilities tomorrow night in
'■ the pavilion. The two always make
quite a bloody mixture of it in most
any athletic combat, but particularly
ure they out for blood when they
come across a sport where that is the
object.
Stanford's team ■will be made up
. mostly of the All-University win
ners, and this year's Indian team is
stronger than usual. The Bears also
j will have some power. —Browne.
1 AMATEUR FOOTBALL A
I PROFITABLE OCCUPATION

| Amateur football, even when kept
|on a strictly amateur scale, is quite
i profitable. A rather obvious state
|ment, no doubt, but it has its into
j nations and insinuations.
For the individual who is a real
I star, the publicity and fame
gained in college football alone
are enough to set him up for sev-
I erij years, without his having to
rely on education, ability, or any-
I thing else for a livelihood. Atfd
still lie is an amateur.
I Bobby Grayson, for example, has
another year of college football, and
if he finishes the 1935 season with a
: fifth of the public notice he re
| ceived last fall, he will spend the
! remainder of the year tui'ning down
i offers for this and that.
Grayson has already been con
i tacted in regard to professional box
i ing and wrestling, neither of which
; activities he has ever participated
; in, and the offers have been highly
; inviting.
