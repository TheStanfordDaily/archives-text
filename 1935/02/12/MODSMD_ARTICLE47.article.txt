# POLOISTS DOWN ATHENS SQUAD
## Fullerton Stars To Score 3 Indian Goals 
### 
Winter season polo activities were j
auspiciously opened last week on the i
Highway Field when the varsity I
mallet-wielders decisively defeated j
a strong Athens Club quartet by a'
score of 7 goals to 1.
The Athens Club outfit was lead j
by Pat Linfoot, one of the most dan- j
gerous low goal poloists on the pen- |
insula. His outstanding play proved j
a thrill to the small gathering of |
spectators despite the fact that the j
Card four outhit and generally out- |
played the rest of the opposition. |
The Club team, composed of Mows- j
ley, Lurisner, Davis and Linfoot, j
was only able to make one goal, and
that in the first chukker by
Lurisner.
During the remainder of the con
test the Stanford lineup of Bill Ene
mark at No. 1, Captain Bill Rogers ;
at 2, Russ Rasmussen at 3, and Bob !
Fullerton at back, clicked well and j
held the upper hand. Fullerton was |
high point man with three Indian !
goals to his credit. Russ Rasmussen j
shot two between the uprights, while ,
Captain Rogers and Enemark each '
got one goal.
The Card quartet played improved i
polo. On one occasion Rogers stole j
the ball way down in front of his j
own goal ahd carried it half the |
length of the field with powerful. |
well-directed strokes, No, 4, Fuller- i
ton, there recovered it when Rogers j
missed and took it the remainder ot ,
the distance to the score.
