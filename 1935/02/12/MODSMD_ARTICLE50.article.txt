Versatile—that's Yvonne Beattie,
Roble freshman and one of Stan
ford's busiest co-eds.
Flying is her chief hobby, and sh£
goes up almost daily. To earn money
for lessons and flying time, she
worked at various jobs for two years!
Her work included washing carsf,
working in a cannery, and writing
poetry. Two years ago she received
an amateur license and is now ac-
J cumulating time for her private pi
lot's license, which she hopes will
I be granted her this summer.
Adept in Art
She no longer writes, but turns
I her talents instead to drawing, at
j which she is remarkably adept. Her
i first interest in art came from pic
| turing airplanes; now she makes life
j studies of her friends and acquaint -
j ances.
i Besides flying, she likes many
j other sports. Canoeing on Lagunita
and basketball in the Women's Gym
J takes up much of her afternoon's
; time, while dancing fills many of
! her evenings.
Studies Chemistry
Chemistry is her favorite study;
• biological research her life' ambi
j tion. She does not believe that wom
j en can be as successful in most walks
| of life as men, and thinks biological
j research one of the few fields in
I which she can hope to be outstand
ing.
Archaeology is another of her
! hobbies. She confesses that she would
I like to spend her life at it, but re
' alizes that it requires more money
| than she can afford. She is especi-
I ally interested in Egyptology, and
' while in Europe several years ago
| she learned to decipher hierogly
| phics so that she might read the an
| cient Egyptian inscriptions.
