Facing a nine composed of prep
and sandlot aces trying out for one
of the Coast League's leading teams,
Harry Wolter's varsity baseball team
will meet the Mission Red Rookies
tomorrow afternoon at 3:15 o'clock
on the Sunken Diamond.
A1 Semmelroth is likely to get the
starting call for the pitcher's box,
both Johnny Campbell and Fred
Heringer having pitched Saturday
against San Jose-State.
