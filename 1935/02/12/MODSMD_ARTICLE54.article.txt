# TROJAN MERMEN TO MEET CARDS
## 
### 
One of the greatest arrays of;
shimming stars ever to enter Encina
Pools will be seen Friday afternoon j
when Southern California — called j
the greatest team in the country — !
meets the Indian varsity in a dual j
meet.
The meet will start at 2:30 o'clock t
and will be the first paying propo- j
sition of the year with admission at |
25 cents for students and 40 cents I
for general admission.
Stanford has never lost a swim- '
tning meet to the Tropans and F' i- j
day will be the first time, Coach j
Nort Thornton cheerfully admits.
The overwhelming supremacy of the
southern team is unquestionable, the j
Card coach says; the Indians will be
swamped.
But while fans are not likely to j
see much of # a competitive meet, j
they will see some of the finest j
swimmers in the country in action. ■
The Trojans this year are |
the nation's f strongest swimming
team. Last year they placed second
to Michigan at the N.C.A.A. cham
pionship at Ohio State. But this year
Michigan has lost some of her stars
while S.C. has retained every one
of hers, and acquired a few more, i
Swimming coaches up and down j
the coast are loud in their praise of j
(he Trojans and even declare they |
have potential N.C.A.A. point win- j

I ners in every event. Unquestionably
I greater than Stanford's great 19.12 j
: team, the Southern Cal outfit may
i prove to be the best swim team of 1
I all time.
In two events, however, the Cards
j will be able to offer competition. 1
I These two are the breaststroke and |
j diving,
