"WE TIIE PEOPLE"
The Editor, Sir:
The great "Red Menace" has at
last thrown its ghastly shadow across j
our treasured cloister. Most of us \
continue —blissfully absorbed in con
templating nothing beyond ourselves ;
and our text. However, I do believe i
that our editorial "Crisis of February
Sixth" has roused me for a moment
from my lethargy.
Liberalism has passed away un
noticed and unmourned. There is no
longer a middle ground — we must
either join the battle cries of the
American Legion, and thumb
noses at the rest of the world from
behind our tariff walls, or else be
labeled "Un-American" and painted
RED.
The great "Red Menace" is a sting-,
ing lash lhat is used, not to protect
j America for "we the people," but
to buttress economic and political
control in the hands of the few, to
crush the life out of organized labor,
and to stigmatize libera! progressive
thought and action. In that extreme,
I question the divine immunity of
all things "status quo."
The ruthless and irresponsible at
j titude of American Journalism to
ward the rights of public opinion,
I is today the harshest thorn in the
]side of Democracy. Faced with a pol
j luted and distorted public opinion,
j what chance has democratic govern
! ment to function—indeed, what
j chance has it even to exist? The
I journalism of Mr. Hearst is today
i.signing the death warrant of Amer
ican Democracy. Mr. Hearst is the
"John Hancock" of American eco
nomic fascism.
