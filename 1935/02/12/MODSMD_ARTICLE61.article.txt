# "MARY PETERS"
## 
### 
I Dear Editor:
I For some time we have watched
the antics of the little figure which j
passes judgment on so much of our
entertainment. Many times we have
fpund him a rather safe guide and,
even when we have disagreed with
his opinions, we have nearly always
been able to understand his point of
view. We would, however, like very
much to see the evaluation of "Mary
Peters" supported in a more specific
and clear-cut manner.
Such phrases as "over-descrip
tion;" "faulty characterization," "with
little purpose," "lack of emphasis and
reality," "mired and bogged," are
particularly easy to apply in wide
sweeping generalities, but we believe
that in this case a fair honest peru
sal of the work would lend little
substantiating evidence.
Believing that many people on
this campus would find "Mary Pet
ers" one of the most penetrating and
realistic portrayals of human char
acter produced by any modern writ
er, we would like,at least to point
out our own opinion of the book
about which one of the most promi
nent critics on the coast says that it
this volume is not named as the best
book of 1934, he will spend the rest
of his life saying that it should have
been.
We agree with "Hayes" in two
particulars—the book is not em
phatic and it has no well-defined
purpose, but it seems to us that, on

the contrary, this adds to rather than
detracts from the realism of the
work. Its characterization or rather,
its character development, appears
almost llawless, and by its very ex
cellence over-shadows the equally
well-drawn representation of locai
color. There is no "faulty charac
terization." There is no character
portrayal who could not be paralleled
in any small village in any part of
the world. The motivation is not al
ways clear, the actions not always
logical, and there is certainly no at
tempt to point out a moral—all of
which contributes to the "reality"
of the story. The book is good be
cause, although its setting is region
al, its psychology is universal.

We agree with "Hayes" in two
particulars—the book is not em
phatic and it has no well-defined
purpose, but it seems to us that, on

the contrary, this adds to rather than
detracts from the realism of the
work. Its characterization or rather,
its character development, appears
almost llawless, and by its very ex
cellence over-shadows the equally
well-drawn representation of locai
color. There is no "faulty charac
terization." There is no character
portrayal who could not be paralleled
in any small village in any part of
the world. The motivation is not al
ways clear, the actions not always
logical, and there is certainly no at
tempt to point out a moral—all of
which contributes to the "reality"
of the story. The book is good be
cause, although its setting is region
al, its psychology is universal.
