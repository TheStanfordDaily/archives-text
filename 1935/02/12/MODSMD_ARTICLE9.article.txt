# Democrats Attempt Two Billion Dollar Relief Cut
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 11
ministration chiefs were concerned
tonight over another Democratic
effort to chop a two billion dollar
chunk off the $4,880,000,000 relief
bill, despite bolstering of White
House hopes along other lines.
The Senate Appropriations Com
mittee gave the Administration its
hopeful sign by voting to reconsider
the "prevailing wage" amendment
adopted last week.
