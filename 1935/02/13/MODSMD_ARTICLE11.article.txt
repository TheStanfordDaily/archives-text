# Plans For New Theatre Are Definitely Approved
## 
### 
Definite approval of a campus the- ]
atre seating 1500, with classrooms,
foyer, promenade, and offices was
given yesterday in a joint meeting
-of University officials, architects,
dramatists, and the New Theatre j
Committee, who agreed that con- j
struction would probably begin this I
year.
The structure will have one of the !
most completely-fitted stages on the
Pacific coast, together with a novel
arrangement for closing ofT the rear |
to reduce seating capacity to 600 fori
play performances. Provisions for the
addition of a smaller Little Theatre |
will be made in blueprints.
Tentative plans were made pre
viously for a dual auditorium, with ,
a theatre for 1500 on one side, a
.smaller auditorium for (500 on the i
other, and a mutual stage between.
This plan, although favored unani
mously because it provided two en- j
tirely dissimilar structures and re
quired only one highly expensive
stage block, would have cost ah ml i

| $609,000.
A second set of blueprints provided
for the 1500 building, and a Lit lie
I Theatre seating only 150., Total ex
pense of this would reach $577,900.
Both also contained complete class
; rooms, offices, dressing rooms, and
! storage space.
Both dual theatre plans would
! have been beyond the $475,000 bud
' get, as calculated by Comptroller
Almon E. Roth. The single audi
torium decided upon will cost less
I than half a million, a sum which
1 can be financed by A.S.S.U. and
other funds.
Present at the conference were
President Ray Lyman Wilbur and
Comptroller Roth; Architects Weihe,
j Brown, Wagner, and Slrowbridge;
â–  dramatic advisors, William Murray
! Timmons, George Andreini, Phil
Brown, and Dick Dawson; and The
atre Committee members, Helen
I Ray, Annalee Whitmore, President
Marvio Kahn, Gordon Steedman,
Norman Barnes, A1 Blackman, and
