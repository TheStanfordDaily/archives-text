# ETHIOPIA DEFIES ITALIAN THREATS
## Abyssinian Army Ready In Row Over Indemnity 
### 
ROME, Feb. 12 (/Pi—Ethiopia's
j diplomatic envoy to Rome an- j
! nounced tonight Ethiopia would not j
i pay a cent to Italy as indemnity, that i
| the African empire had one million j
j men available to fight Italy, that no 1
foreign power was expected as an
ally, and that "Ethiopia does not!
need one."
This .statement was made directly j
I to the Associated Press by Negradas j
; Yesus, Ethiopian Charge D'Afl'aires i
in Rome, after authoritative circles
; had stated that Italy, in negotia
-1 tions now under way in Addis
Ababa, had demanded about 44,900 i
i in indemnities for Italian casualties |
and a salute to the Italian flag, as j
, well as other tributes.
Legation Guarded
j Yesus declared more Ethiopians!
• than Italians had been killed in re
! cent clashes on the Ethiopian borders
! of Italy's colonies in Africa and that,
I furthermore, the idea of paying any
' kind of indemnities was abhorent ■
; to the Ethiopians.
Despite the fact that most of the |
J furniture was moved out of the
.heavily guarded Ethiopian legation j
i today, Yesus said he did not con- i
: sider himself in any personal danger
1 and that the furniture removed be- |
! longed to the owner of the legation.
King Throws Gauntlet
ROME, Feb. 12—Ethiopia's "king!
!of kings," Hailie Selassie, gave the 1
; lie direct to Benito Mussolini's bris
' tling accusations against Ethiopia
: tonight as Rome and all Italy hum- j
i med with warlike preparations.
The emperor's statement, flatly j
: denying Italy's charges that Ethio- 1
! pians were the aggressors in recent
! African border clashes, was made
i through Negradas Yesus, Ethiopian
Charge d'Affaires.
In Italian official circles, where
| the empeior's message will become
! virtually an official challenge with
its presentation to the Italian gov
i ernment tomorrow, the reaction was
j that the gauntlet had been flung
down.
