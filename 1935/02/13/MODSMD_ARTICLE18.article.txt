# Lewis Sells Of Changes In Writings
## Literature Prof Describes Technical Influence 
### 
That the technical influence in
literature has wrought a great
change in English literature was the
view expressed last night by Profes
sor Edwin H. Lewis of the Univer
sity of Chicago.
In showing the relationship be
tween science and literature, Pro
fessor Lewis illustrated by tracing
roots of words to their Greek ori
gin. He said that knowing and writ
ing coincide, and both can be equal
ly well developed in one man. He
cited the example of Dr. E. C.
Franklin of the Stanford chemistry
department.
"If English can only teach the
students to repeat what another
man said without slandering him, it
has accomplished something," he
said.
Enlarging further upon the ety
mology of words, Professor Lewis
proved that the metaphor was used
in common by scientists and writ
ers, the former making of it the
alchemy of literature, and the latter
creating organic masterpieces from
it. "Our language is such a hodge
podge that it is impossible to talk
for more than five minutes without
making an unconscious pun."
To translate scientific truths in I <
the language of literature, however
requires time, because of the infi
nite number of ramifications implied
by even an ordinary sentence.
