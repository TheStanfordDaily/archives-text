SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 12.—The airship Macon, felled by sudden
disaster, plunged dizzily from fofifiy skies to the ocean 110 miles south of
here late today, and the navy, responding to frantic SOS calls, performed
heroic rescues in picking up Commander Herbert Victor Wiley and litl
other survivors of the giant dirigible. Two men were reported missing,

>one of them a wireless operator.
A roaring explosion was believed
to have torn the Macon apart, navy
men here believed, after a wireless
message told of a "bad casualty" in
the air.
A red rocket shot into the dark
sky when the Macon struck the
water 17 miles off Poi/ii. Cur.
Curling spray flowed from bows
of nearby navy ships as they sped
quickly to the rescue.
111 n message sent at 9:15 o'clock.
Admiral Courtney said it ap
peared none of the survivors was
seriously injured, and apparently
Daley, radio operator, and Ed
j quibia, mess attendant, were the
only ones missing.
A later message told of Com
mander Wiley and Lieutenant Com
| mander Jesse Kenworthy, executive
! officer of the airship, being rescued
! along with nhie others in one boat.
| They were in the first of the rescu
; ing lifeboats to reach the U.S.S.
Concord.
The Macon was returning with
certain craft from maneuvers in
i Southern California. So sudden was
I the disaster that the Macon rocked
and plunged swiftly to the ocean.
The weather was rough off Point
Sur, rain was fa'lling and the sky w<is
overcast. A giant searchlight shot
through the darkness-in attempts to
! pick up the distressed airship.
The quick call for aid said tint
a "bad casualty" in the air, and it
"was falling"' shortly thereafter.
The Mackey radio station here
caught another SOS call saying:
"Will abandon ship as soon as we
I land on the water, somewhere
twenty miles off Point Sur. probably
10 miles at sea."
Wiley flashed his first SOS at
5:15 o'clock, and so swiftly did the
; navy ships rush to the disaster that
1 the i-escue was reported at 7:35
o'clock.
