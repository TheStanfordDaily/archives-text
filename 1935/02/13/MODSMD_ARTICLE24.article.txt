# Time Marches On — New Men at the Helm
## 
### 
Another six months are gone and another
period of student activity with many new
leaders comes to the'campus.
W illi the days of Volume <S(> numbered but
three, a new editor came home to the Daily
olliees last night to he congratulated by stall'
members and friends who have followed his
many activities on the Farm.
.iulitis L. Jacobs has been selected by his
mates to lead the way as chief of Volume S7,
a new step which the-Daily officially engages
upon with next Monday's issue.
An interesting feature of the election is
found in the caliber of the men whose mis
fortune it was to lose the race for that editor
ship
"Chuck" Chappell and "Spud" Hamilton
are a pair of men liked and respected by every
member of the editorial stall'. Able journal
ists, intelligent thinkers, damn line fellows,
their defeat of yesterday detracts not one whit
from their ability as newshawks. It would
he d i flic 1111 for any electorate to choose one
from among three good men, and it is true
that only one may win.
Jacobs knows the campus, lie has partici
pated in many and varied activities. He prom
ises to serve Ibis campus as best he can and
the Daily should benefit with the realization
ol that goal. »

"Jake" will be assisted in his new job by a
level-headed, cool, efficient managing editor
named Bob Calkins.
Charlotte Burridge, climaxing a period, of
active service to the Daily as reporter, col
umnist, and feature editor, as well as editor
of the fashion issues and photolith supple
ment. rises to the head of feminine journalists
as women's editor for the ensuing volume.
Two active, popular, keen-visioned associ
ate editors are to he found in the persons of
Bob Jones and Frank Orr. Both prominent on
the campus, acquainted with local and na
tional all'airs, they should provide several in
teresting editorials for campus readers.
The night editors—Johnny Kline (already
one of the besl ), Elaine Frisk, Millard Browne,
George Wilson, Jane Dodge, and Phil Dully—
include excellent material that will provide
plenty of still' competition for future promo
tions.
Associated Press Editor Dorothy Sweet,
Feature Editor John McClelland, Sports Edi
tor Mori D'Evelyn, and News Editor Loren
Irwin have risen to these new posts because
of outstanding service thai couldn't be de
nied.
A compliment lo one of the Daily's out
standing review editors conies with the reten
tion of Henry Brill in that capacity by unani
mous request from the outgoing hoard.
