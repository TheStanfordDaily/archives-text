# Concerts or Exams?
## 
### 
Stanford likes music. That statement
is proved by the large crowds that, even in
"slack" limes, lurn out lo hear the world
famous iirlisls which are yearly presenled on
the A.S.S.I'. concert series.
These artists cannol all he obtained on
scholastically convenient evenings, tor obvi
ous reasons of schedule.
Igor Stravinsky, famous composer and
pianist who appears tomorrow night, is one
ol these; arid the concert's attendance seems
likely to go by the boards as a result of the
unusually heavy examination schedule which
is on I he fire for Friday.
Many professors are aware of cultural and
educational events which occur on the cam

jiiis, ;in<f recognize their value by adapting ex
amination schedules accordingly. But tomor
row night, sad to say, hundreds of students
who would otherwise attend the concert fear
they will be forced to stay at home and study.
The faculty is aware of the cultural value
of such concerts; and revised niidquarler ex
amination schedules, where they are possible,
might serve to correct the error before it is
made.
