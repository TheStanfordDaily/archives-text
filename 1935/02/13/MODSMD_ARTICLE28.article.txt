# FIGHTING FATHER
## 
### JOHN L. KLINE 
(Last of n scries on Father CoUghlin, amazing
radio priest, who has only recently come into
prominence on the Coast'—thanks to W.R.H.'s
front page spread of liis anti-World Court prayer—
but who has long been a well-known force in the
East, this article deals with his personality, man
nerisms, position, and possible future.)
"If I threw away my faith, I would surround myself
with the most adroit hijackers, leam every trick of
the highest banking and stock manipulations, avail
myseli of the laws under which to hide my own crimes,
create a smoke screen to throw into the eyes of men,
and—believe me—l would become the world's cham
pion crook. If I didn't believe in religion and in a
happy land beyond, I would get everything for myself
that I could lay my hands on in the world."
The key to Father Coughlin lies in the above words
of his own. Perhaps he made the statement merely for
effect, or to prove a point. That he said it at all gives
i us a strong clue as to the type of man with which we
■ are confronted. It goes almost without saying that he
! has a strong lust for power. Concimitantly, he appears
| essentially selfish, lacking ideals, and thinking of
everything—even religion and eternity—in terms of
1 Mr. C. E. Coughlin.
Any man' who is a good publicist and an egoist
is likely to be a good actor. Coughlin is an excellent
: one, playing several roles. Often disat-iningly
straightforward and direct, he is equally often so
rhetorical and involved that almost Hny interpreta
tion can be placed on his statements.
Foremost dramatic incident in his career was a
i "bomb" which he himself found in his own cellar some
! time ago. Since the "bomb" was but a shoebox full oi
powder, without any fuse arrangement, police dropped
the case, being far from convinced that he did not plant
it himself. At any rate, he made local front pages.
Sometimes the taiher seems to strive mightily for
effect and put up clever fronts. One visitor was kept
waiting while (supposedly) Governor Pinchot phoned
to ask whether he should arrest, or just reason with,
some recalcitrant strikers: A moment later a secre
tary popped in to ask Coughlin if he would talk to
Professor Moley who was calling from Washington.
The father said he was too busy; to ask him to call
later.
Although not personally avaricious, the priest is
i astute and practical-minded in his dealings and keeps
his organization running at high speed over smooth
financial ground. While inveighing against Wall Street
brokers and their practices, at that very moment he
had one of them handling his funds. The letters which
pour in to him are not thrown into a corner—he main
tains a file of over 2.000,000 names of interested parties.
Like most publicists, Coughlin has to stoop
occasionally to Winchellian distortions. He scath
ingly rebuked two Catholic bishops and A1 Smith
for connection with the money interests, after the
three had visited Morgan. As a matter of fact,
the .visit was purely in regard to a relief committee
on which all four were serving.
Those who have met Coughlin describe him as
likeable, quick, intelligent and friendly, being rather
unpretentious in his dealings, damning and helling to
a mild degree, doing a good deal of floor-pacing, and
smoking unceasingly. Most reactionary point about
him is his stand on birth control. Even more conserva
tive than most Catholics, he hates the mere mention
of it. He is very proud of having helped force out
former Michigan U. President Little over this issue.
Reporters are almost unanimous in complaining
that he is so inexplicit. He may sound explicit over
the air, they say, but they are at a loss to find that
factual type of materiat that makes a story readahle.
For example he once spoke of "the vested interests ol
intellect" by which he had everyone baflled. Best guess
as to the answer is that he meant the leaders of orga
nized labor —he appears to favor a fascist solution of
labor difficulties.
Similarly, he denounces capitalism as production
exclusively for profit; communism as production
for use; and recommends "Christian capitalism
as "production for use at a profit." No one has
gotten that straight yet.
However, a minimum of exactitude and a maximum
of emotionalism seems to be included in the recipe for
mixing the ingredients of any political* movement.
Like Hitler, he reaches the deep-seated prejudices
almost unconsciously held by his auditors. Widespread
animosity toward "the bankers" and cravings for a
leveling-off of social inequalities are storehouses upon
which he draws.
If F.R. fails, a dictatorship will follow, Coughlin
asserts, cannily neglecting to say if he has any aspira
tions to the position. Yet he knows no fascist move
ment can grow very fast in this country without his
aid, for he has a headstart and all the proper con
stituents: a party; a near-radical program which is
"safe" in its labor stand, which guarantees the profit
system, and which appeals simultaneously to the
farmers, the middle class, and the big jmployers.
For the present, his church is back of him. The
only man with direct authority over him under canon
law, the none-too-conservative Bishop Gallagher, <s
directly behind him. Coughlin's National League for
Social Justice takes him into an enlarged field, how
ever. If it flops, it may prove a boomerang to him
personally.
The ability to spielbind and to preach does not
necessarily include the ability to run a political party.
Moreover, it is one thing to be a sanctimonious voice
from thr ether criticizing with apparent disinterest, md
quite another to get into the middle of a political mud
slinging set-to.
Most apt pigeon-liolelng title yd suggested for
the broadcasting father is that of "The Nation's
Bark-Seat Driver."

tains a file of over 2.000,000 names of interested parties.
Like most publicists, Coughlin has to stoop
occasionally to Winchellian distortions. He scath
ingly rebuked two Catholic bishops and A1 Smith
for connection with the money interests, after the
three had visited Morgan. As a matter of fact,
the .visit was purely in regard to a relief committee
on which all four were serving.
Those who have met Coughlin describe him as
likeable, quick, intelligent and friendly, being rather
unpretentious in his dealings, damning and helling to
a mild degree, doing a good deal of floor-pacing, and
smoking unceasingly. Most reactionary point about
him is his stand on birth control. Even more conserva
tive than most Catholics, he hates the mere mention
of it. He is very proud of having helped force out
former Michigan U. President Little over this issue.
Reporters are almost unanimous in complaining
that he is so inexplicit. He may sound explicit over
the air, they say, but they are at a loss to find that
factual type of materiat that makes a story readahle.
For example he once spoke of "the vested interests ol
intellect" by which he had everyone baflled. Best guess
as to the answer is that he meant the leaders of orga
nized labor —he appears to favor a fascist solution of
labor difficulties.
Similarly, he denounces capitalism as production
exclusively for profit; communism as production
for use; and recommends "Christian capitalism
as "production for use at a profit." No one has
gotten that straight yet.
However, a minimum of exactitude and a maximum
of emotionalism seems to be included in the recipe for
mixing the ingredients of any political* movement.
Like Hitler, he reaches the deep-seated prejudices
almost unconsciously held by his auditors. Widespread
animosity toward "the bankers" and cravings for a
leveling-off of social inequalities are storehouses upon
which he draws.
If F.R. fails, a dictatorship will follow, Coughlin
asserts, cannily neglecting to say if he has any aspira
tions to the position. Yet he knows no fascist move
ment can grow very fast in this country without his
aid, for he has a headstart and all the proper con
stituents: a party; a near-radical program which is
"safe" in its labor stand, which guarantees the profit
system, and which appeals simultaneously to the
farmers, the middle class, and the big jmployers.
For the present, his church is back of him. The
only man with direct authority over him under canon
law, the none-too-conservative Bishop Gallagher, <s
directly behind him. Coughlin's National League for
Social Justice takes him into an enlarged field, how
ever. If it flops, it may prove a boomerang to him
personally.
The ability to spielbind and to preach does not
necessarily include the ability to run a political party.
Moreover, it is one thing to be a sanctimonious voice
from thr ether criticizing with apparent disinterest, md
quite another to get into the middle of a political mud
slinging set-to.
Most apt pigeon-liolelng title yd suggested for
the broadcasting father is that of "The Nation's

"If I threw away my faith, I would surround myself
with the most adroit hijackers, leam every trick of
the highest banking and stock manipulations, avail
myseli of the laws under which to hide my own crimes,
create a smoke screen to throw into the eyes of men,
and—believe me—l would become the world's cham

The key to Father Coughlin lies in the above words
of his own. Perhaps he made the statement merely for
effect, or to prove a point. That he said it at all gives
i us a strong clue as to the type of man with which we
■ are confronted. It goes almost without saying that he

everything—even religion and eternity—in terms of
1 Mr. C. E. Coughlin.
Any man' who is a good publicist and an egoist
is likely to be a good actor. Coughlin is an excellent
: one, playing several roles. Often disat-iningly
straightforward and direct, he is equally often so
rhetorical and involved that almost Hny interpreta
tion can be placed on his statements.
Foremost dramatic incident in his career was a
i "bomb" which he himself found in his own cellar some
! time ago. Since the "bomb" was but a shoebox full oi
powder, without any fuse arrangement, police dropped
the case, being far from convinced that he did not plant
it himself. At any rate, he made local front pages.
Sometimes the taiher seems to strive mightily for
effect and put up clever fronts. One visitor was kept
waiting while (supposedly) Governor Pinchot phoned
to ask whether he should arrest, or just reason with,
some recalcitrant strikers: A moment later a secre
tary popped in to ask Coughlin if he would talk to
Professor Moley who was calling from Washington.
The father said he was too busy; to ask him to call
later.
Although not personally avaricious, the priest is
i astute and practical-minded in his dealings and keeps
his organization running at high speed over smooth
financial ground. While inveighing against Wall Street
brokers and their practices, at that very moment he
had one of them handling his funds. The letters which

"If I threw away my faith, I would surround myself

the highest banking and stock manipulations, avail

The key to Father Coughlin lies in the above words
of his own. Perhaps he made the statement merely for
effect, or to prove a point. That he said it at all gives
i us a strong clue as to the type of man with which we
■ are confronted. It goes almost without saying that he
! has a strong lust for power. Concimitantly, he appears
| essentially selfish, lacking ideals, and thinking of
everything—even religion and eternity—in terms of
1 Mr. C. E. Coughlin.
Any man' who is a good publicist and an egoist
is likely to be a good actor. Coughlin is an excellent
: one, playing several roles. Often disat-iningly
straightforward and direct, he is equally often so
rhetorical and involved that almost Hny interpreta
tion can be placed on his statements.
Foremost dramatic incident in his career was a
i "bomb" which he himself found in his own cellar some
! time ago. Since the "bomb" was but a shoebox full oi
powder, without any fuse arrangement, police dropped
the case, being far from convinced that he did not plant
it himself. At any rate, he made local front pages.
Sometimes the taiher seems to strive mightily for
effect and put up clever fronts. One visitor was kept
waiting while (supposedly) Governor Pinchot phoned
to ask whether he should arrest, or just reason with,
some recalcitrant strikers: A moment later a secre
tary popped in to ask Coughlin if he would talk to
Professor Moley who was calling from Washington.
The father said he was too busy; to ask him to call
later.
Although not personally avaricious, the priest is
i astute and practical-minded in his dealings and keeps
his organization running at high speed over smooth
financial ground. While inveighing against Wall Street
brokers and their practices, at that very moment he
had one of them handling his funds. The letters which
pour in to him are not thrown into a corner—he main
tains a file of over 2.000,000 names of interested parties.
Like most publicists, Coughlin has to stoop
occasionally to Winchellian distortions. He scath
ingly rebuked two Catholic bishops and A1 Smith
for connection with the money interests, after the
three had visited Morgan. As a matter of fact,
the .visit was purely in regard to a relief committee
on which all four were serving.
Those who have met Coughlin describe him as
likeable, quick, intelligent and friendly, being rather
unpretentious in his dealings, damning and helling to
a mild degree, doing a good deal of floor-pacing, and
smoking unceasingly. Most reactionary point about
him is his stand on birth control. Even more conserva
tive than most Catholics, he hates the mere mention
of it. He is very proud of having helped force out
former Michigan U. President Little over this issue.
Reporters are almost unanimous in complaining
that he is so inexplicit. He may sound explicit over
the air, they say, but they are at a loss to find that
factual type of materiat that makes a story readahle.
For example he once spoke of "the vested interests ol
intellect" by which he had everyone baflled. Best guess
as to the answer is that he meant the leaders of orga
nized labor —he appears to favor a fascist solution of
labor difficulties.
Similarly, he denounces capitalism as production
exclusively for profit; communism as production
for use; and recommends "Christian capitalism
as "production for use at a profit." No one has
gotten that straight yet.
However, a minimum of exactitude and a maximum
of emotionalism seems to be included in the recipe for
mixing the ingredients of any political* movement.
Like Hitler, he reaches the deep-seated prejudices
almost unconsciously held by his auditors. Widespread
animosity toward "the bankers" and cravings for a
leveling-off of social inequalities are storehouses upon
which he draws.
If F.R. fails, a dictatorship will follow, Coughlin
asserts, cannily neglecting to say if he has any aspira
tions to the position. Yet he knows no fascist move
ment can grow very fast in this country without his
aid, for he has a headstart and all the proper con
stituents: a party; a near-radical program which is
"safe" in its labor stand, which guarantees the profit
system, and which appeals simultaneously to the
farmers, the middle class, and the big jmployers.
For the present, his church is back of him. The
only man with direct authority over him under canon
law, the none-too-conservative Bishop Gallagher, <s
directly behind him. Coughlin's National League for
Social Justice takes him into an enlarged field, how
ever. If it flops, it may prove a boomerang to him
personally.
