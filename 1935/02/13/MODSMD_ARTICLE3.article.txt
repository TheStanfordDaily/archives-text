# May Initiate Work Soon On Theatre
## Ex Committee Discusses Plans and Costs 
### 
"It looks to me as if work will
begin on the New Theatre some
time this year," said A.S.S.U. Presi
dent Marvie Kuhn at the meeting oi
the Ex Committee last night to
sound the keynote of the half year's
work.
Despite- the importance of the
ever-recurring pitched battle over
Daily financial troubles, the com
mittee's big project of the year has
been the problem of building of the
New Theatre.
Construction of the New Theatre
is not yet assured, but the report
given in Ex Committee last night
by Kahn sounded a keynote of
confidence.
Plans for the New Theatre are
now proceeding along the lines of
combining (lie advantages of a
large assembly ball of * Â«)() seat
ing capacity with a Little Theatre
of perfect acoustics seating 600.
This will be attained by some
method of shutting off the bal
ance of the auditorium when plays
are produced. Complete plans will
be presented to the Theatre Com
mittee by the University archi
tects in next Tuesday's meeting.
Cost of such a theatre is estimated
at $500,000, of which the A.S.S.U.
would have to pay $300,000 over a
period of twenty years.
Elections Approved
The results of yesterday's mid
term elections, except the short
term Men's Council vote, were de
clared official. The short-term re
sults, because of the counting of an
inexperienced man, will not be offi
cial until a recount is taken.
By a unanimous vote of the eight
members present, Ex Committee
laid the Daily 15 cent ghost for a
while. The new by-law returns any
surplus from the editorial budget
to the A.S.S.U.
Members Thanked
Bidding a farewell to departing
members, Woody Adams, Chuck
Glasgow, Sam Lee, and ex-ofiicio
member Stan Beaubaire, Kahn
thanked them for their coopera
tion and services.
Student Manager Ben Cave suh
mitted arr estimate that it would
take five hours work to combine all
(he "forgotten by-laws" of the Con
stitution into a unified code.
Talks Proposed
Informal talks by President Wil
bur once every two weeks as a
contact between the administration
and the students may be held in the
future. The committee empowered
Marvie Kahn to conduct negotiations
on the matter.
Although last night's meeting was
closed, there were no Machiavellian
plots going on behind the barred
doors. The usual business of the
theatre and the Daily was discussed
v/ithout any unusual deviation from
the usual procedure.
