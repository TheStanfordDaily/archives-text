# CAMPUS OPINION
## DEFENSE OR OFFENSE? 
### 
The Editor. Sir:
In reading the results of the Lit
erary Digest poll on the question of
war in yesterday's paper, a problem
arose which must • occur to every
serious student of international af
fairs. Three-fourths of Stanford stu
dents replying to the questionnaire
said that they would fight if at
tacked, and would not fight in an
offensive war.
But—were we defending ourselves
in the World War against the Ger
man submarine attack, were we de
fending democracy, or financial bets
in the form of investments on the
side of the Allies, or by sending
troops overseas were we technically
attacking? Were we defending our
selves against Communism by send
ing troops to Siberia in 1919? Were
the Japanese attacking the Chinese
or defending themselves (as claimed)
against banditry in Manchuria? In
the next war who can distinguish
an attack from a defense, since the
best defense is a good offense, es
pecially in air war. Perhaps the ques

tion is reduced to the simple fact of
war. The time to debate Whether or
not we want it is not after war is
declared. —Drayton S. Bryant.
The Editor, Sir:
To ma, Mr. Hearst's attitude in
regard to communism in the colleges
is a bit comical. Much more harmful,
it seems to me, is Mr. Hearst's propa
ganda favoring nationalism than any
college professor's preaching of
communism to his classes. If the pro
fessor's lectures are to be censored,
how much more should Mr. Hearst's
editorials be censored, if we grant
that censorship is a desirable meth
od of quelling opposition.
Mr. Hearst's influence is over mil
lions, many of a low order of intel
ligence. The college professor deals
with only a small number of stu
dents, representing on the whole, a
rather high order of intelligence.
They need not fear that communism
will ruin Jhe country for a while
yet—not while Mr. Hearst is here.
Mr. Hearst is doing very nicely.
