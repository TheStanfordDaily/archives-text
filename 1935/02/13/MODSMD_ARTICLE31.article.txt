MERRILY WE ROLL ALONG
At the Curran Theatre
"Merrily 'We Roll Along" is one
| of those plays which a critic enjoys
thoroughly, yet hates to write about.
In other words, it is so good there is
nothing to say, except DON'T MiSS
IT.
The manner in which the play is
! presented is perhaps its most im
pressive feature. The opening scene
takes place in 1935 in the home of
| Richard Niles, successful and degen
-1 erate writer of spicy plays. Each
J succeeding scene takes place ,a few
I years earlier, until the final curtain
| comes down on young Richard Niles,
i a man who is some day to write
. something great, urging his fellow
' students in his valedictory address
' never to forget their ideals.
Douglass Montgomery does re
| markable work as Richard Niles,
i and every member of the cast ae
! serves praise for a fine performance,
! The sets are good, and the costum
ing excellent, especially in the 1927
scene, the era of the knee-length
; dress.
"Merrily We Roll Along" closes
Saturday, and I sincerely believe
you will be sorry if you miss it.
