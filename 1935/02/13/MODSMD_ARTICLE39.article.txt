MORT D'EVELYN NEW
SPORTS STAFF HEAD
Take it away, Mort.
Volume 86 of The Stanford Daily
has closed down, and with the inaug
uration of the new volume comes
the turning over of this column to
Mort D'EVelyn for the remainder of
the school year.
D'Evelyn will have a much wider
variety of sports with which to
fill the pages during the spring
season than this writer did last
fall, and he will have an able staff
supporting him. Mort has given a
great deal of assistance particu
larly in the handling of winter
sports, and he was a hard worker
during the nightmare of football
season.
Having spent a year and a half on
the staff, D'Evelyn has made many
connections about the various Stan
ford athletic fields, and he is widely
acquainted with the different sport
ing activities.
Assisting D'Evelyn will be a con
scientious staff, including Gordy
Frost, Warren Breed, Frank Tre
maine, Richard Levi, Charles Thom
as, Jack Newman, and Irvin Jor
gensen.
SPRING FURNISHES
ATHLETIC CIRCUS
The last half of the year is never
the one-track set-up that the first
half necessarily must be because of
football and the wide interest shown
in it. Every spring Saturday is worse
than a three-ring circus with Lhe
constant round of baseball, track,
golf, tennis, rugby, swimming, polo,
basketball, and most everything else
from pinochle playing to billiards—
all of which makes the Monday
morning papers quite well filled with
summaries of the various events.
All of the rugby enthusiasts
moan because there is hardly a
column of rugby on Monday; the
baseball players are also disap
pointed with but a column, etc.,
and the night editor screams if
there is more than three inches;
it makes quite a vicious circle.
This spring Stanford will be de
fending a couple of track titles, and
in spite of Brick Morse and most
anyone else, the Indians will be right
up there in the national meets (or
meet, as the case might be). The
baseball team may get off the dime,
and probably will get well into the
league race; the swimming team will
be good, but not sensational, and the
tennis team should be one of the
best ever.
Rugby will bo finished success
fully, and basketball at least will
furnish copy, so Ihere will be plenty
of work for the next four months in
sports.
PRESENT VOLUME
HAD ITS MOMENTS
From the spectators' standpoint,
and hence from the news value
standpoint, football of course was the
big thing for the present regime.
This writer had the pleasure* of fol
lowing Stanford's most successful
seasori in history, notwithstanding
Alabama and all the flying Ele
phants.
It was a genuine treat to watch
the Indians as they appeared
against Southern California and
Washington, and to watch them
build to an even greater 1935 sea
sort. Once again next year Stan
ford will dominate Pacific Coast
football, and I sincerely envy the
sports editor next fall.
So, there is nothing left to say but,
"Don't cat that, grandmaw—"
—Browne.

MORT D'EVELYN NEW
SPORTS STAFF HEAD
Take it away, Mort.
Volume 86 of The Stanford Daily
has closed down, and with the inaug
uration of the new volume comes
the turning over of this column to
Mort D'EVelyn for the remainder of
the school year.
D'Evelyn will have a much wider
variety of sports with which to
fill the pages during the spring
season than this writer did last
fall, and he will have an able staff
supporting him. Mort has given a
great deal of assistance particu
larly in the handling of winter
sports, and he was a hard worker
during the nightmare of football
season.
Having spent a year and a half on
the staff, D'Evelyn has made many
connections about the various Stan
ford athletic fields, and he is widely
acquainted with the different sport
ing activities.
Assisting D'Evelyn will be a con
scientious staff, including Gordy
Frost, Warren Breed, Frank Tre
maine, Richard Levi, Charles Thom
as, Jack Newman, and Irvin Jor
gensen.
SPRING FURNISHES
ATHLETIC CIRCUS
The last half of the year is never
the one-track set-up that the first
half necessarily must be because of
football and the wide interest shown
in it. Every spring Saturday is worse
than a three-ring circus with Lhe
constant round of baseball, track,
golf, tennis, rugby, swimming, polo,
basketball, and most everything else
from pinochle playing to billiards—
all of which makes the Monday
morning papers quite well filled with
summaries of the various events.
All of the rugby enthusiasts
moan because there is hardly a
column of rugby on Monday; the
baseball players are also disap
pointed with but a column, etc.,
and the night editor screams if
there is more than three inches;
it makes quite a vicious circle.
This spring Stanford will be de
fending a couple of track titles, and
in spite of Brick Morse and most
anyone else, the Indians will be right
up there in the national meets (or
meet, as the case might be). The
baseball team may get off the dime,
and probably will get well into the
league race; the swimming team will
be good, but not sensational, and the
tennis team should be one of the
best ever.
Rugby will bo finished success
fully, and basketball at least will
furnish copy, so Ihere will be plenty
of work for the next four months in
sports.
PRESENT VOLUME
HAD ITS MOMENTS
From the spectators' standpoint,
and hence from the news value
standpoint, football of course was the
big thing for the present regime.
This writer had the pleasure* of fol
lowing Stanford's most successful
seasori in history, notwithstanding
Alabama and all the flying Ele
phants.
It was a genuine treat to watch
the Indians as they appeared
against Southern California and
Washington, and to watch them
build to an even greater 1935 sea
sort. Once again next year Stan
ford will dominate Pacific Coast
football, and I sincerely envy the
sports editor next fall.
So, there is nothing left to say but,
"Don't cat that, grandmaw—"
—Browne.
