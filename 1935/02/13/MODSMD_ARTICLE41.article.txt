# Indian Frosh Defeated By Cal Cubs, 42-58, Last Night
## 
### 
Faced with a Cal scoring spurt
led by Chet Carlyle and Bob Mc-
Corney that came late in the second
half, the Stanford frosh cagers found
it )o difficult to regain their pre
vious lead and dropped their game,
42-58, at Berkeley last night.
At the end of the first half, the
Cards had gained a well-earned
edge of 19-18. But from the mid
point of the second half on, it
looked like all Cal. Carlyle and Mc-
Corney broke loose for the Bears
and went on to end the game, tally- [
ing 23 points each and .splitting high !
score honors.
Last night's was the second â€¢ ilt in
two weeks that the Card papooses [
have lost after having been prev- 1
iously undefeated during the sea
son. They seemed to be just as "off"
their regular form last night as they
were last Friday evening when they
received their first defeat of the
season administered at the hands of !
the S.F.U. frosh. l

Hank Luisetti, forward, and Dick
Lyon, center, looked good for the
Cards, however, and scored 19 and
13 points respectively. But even their
stellar performances could not stem
the flow of the Bears' attack.
Carlyle, one of the high scorers for
Cal, was playing his first game last
night after being absent from the
lineup for several weeks with a
broken hand. He was apparently
making up for lost time in contribu
ting his share to the first Cal frosh
win over the Card yearlings in three
| years.
