# S.C. Champs To Invade Encina Plunge Friday
## Gilhula, Paulsen To Lead Trojan Swimmers 
### John McClelland 
Troy will come to the Farm Fri
day afternoon for the annual S.C.-.
Stanford swimming meet, but how it
will come! Stars, champions—enough
to make of what would ordinarily be
ju.st another meet the most spectacu
lar ever held in Encina pools.
What Southern Cal failed to do in
football this year it is setting out to
do in the water—win championships.
The Indian swimmers don't hope to
win a meet; they will merely be out
comparing themselves with some of
the world's best.
World Titlists
Greatest in the Trojan lineup is
probably Jimmy Gilhula, national
200-meter champion and holder of
world records at 440 yards, 300 yards,
1500 meters and 150 yards. Then there
is John Paulsen, holder of the
world's interscholastic record of
1;07.6 for the 100-yard breaststroke.
Other champions are: John Kaye,
national interscholastic champion in
the backstroke in 1932, runner-up at
the N.C.A.A. championships last
year, and all-American intercolle
giate selection in 1934; Gene Fletch
er, all-American sprinter in 1934:
Curtis Cummings, junior national
100-yard free style champion; and
Gordon Warner, another breast
stroke champion.
Gilhula Great
Last summer Gilhula led the De
troit Athletic club to the National
A.A.U. championship in the Lagoon
at the World's Fair. In 1932 he was a
high school boy member of the
American Olympic team and last
year in the N.C.A.A. at Ohio State
swam stroke for stroke with Wash
ington's Jack Medica in the 220 free
style race.
Nort Thornton, coach of the In
dians, foresees disaster to the Pacific
Coast intercollegiate marks, every
one of which was set by a Stanford
swimmer. If the Trojans are in top
form they will be capable of setting
new records in every event.
