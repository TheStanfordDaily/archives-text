# BULL SESSION
## ORCHIDS 
### 
The Stanford Administration col
lects more than its share of seol
lions, and miscellaneous vegetables.
Many of them it deserves. Many of
them fall to the Administration be
cause there is no other place for
them to fall.
Yet even to a cold-sounding ab
straction like '"the Administration"
must come orchids, when orchids
are due.
The University has taken cogni
zance of what has come to be cailcd
the E.F.il. ("Eneina Fire Hazard"').
The Administration minimizes the
E.F.H., and says that the vision oi
an Eneina reduced to ashes is more
inspiration than reality. Still, aware
that though a great fire has never
come to Eneina, there is still the
chance that it might, the Adminis
tration will take estimates on the
cost of installation of new and bet
ter fire escapes in the freshman hall.
For which, orchids.
Further, for some time past the
Administration has had underway
the installation of an adequate fire
alarm system in Eneina. Fire alarm
boxes on every floor will be ready at
a moment's notice to send direct
word of '"FIRE" to the fire depart
ment. In the dead of night, in the

early morning—when the hall phonp
exchange is closed, these alarms will
be on duty. For which, orchids.
If these protective devices are
made available to Encina, there must
fall upon freshmen an increased
recognition of their own responsi
bility in making more or less of the
E.F.H. With the most up-to-date
equipment known to science and the
University, Encina will still be dan
gerous if Encinamen want to make it
so.
A new fire alarm systsem can bo
just so much more Encina iun. The
prospect of fire bells waking the
whole of Encina at 4 o'clock in the
morning may appeal to some as real
sport. But the mind that finds sport
in such can find better housing down
the Peninsula at Agnew, than here
at Stanford.
A new system of fire escapes can
mean just so much more grief for
Encina sponsors. But if Encinamen
really want fire protection, they must
agree not to use this benefit as a
new form of bedevilment.
The University plans to do its
job. Encina must reciprocate.
