# Cardinal Ruggers Leave For Game With Trojans
## 
### 
Card ruggers venture south Fri
day night to open their conference
series, playing U.S.C.'s Trojans
Saturday.
The following week U.C.L.A.
comes north to play the Cards; then
the last game with Cal is on
March 2.
Coach Henry Maloney starts to
bear down in training, for the three
tough conference games in a row
will be no picnic for his men.
Wet weather halted any team
workout yesterday, but there will
be sessions this afternoon and to
morrow. Maloney plans t*o stress an
improvement in backfield play, tor
the backs did not look as good as
usual Saturday against the Olympic
Club.
