# Faculty Faces Featured By Funnymen
## 
### 
Out of a Hurry of ballots, votes, (
and sophomore women, Editor Gor- j
don Steedman of the Stanford Chap- I
arral will emerge victor by a nose j
in the annual comic valentine con- I
test tomorrow.
I "I owe my success to clean liv- j
! ing, and clean thinking, and clean- !
! ing out my opponents," Steedman I
! will say if pressed. It not pressed, he j
will at least be clean.
The Oj_.D BOY is issuing the Fac
; ulty number tomorrow, Thursday, St. j
j Valentine's day, anyway, tomorrow.
J Friday morning early Steedman will !
I carefully pack his luggage and leave j
j school.
The reason for Steedman's hasty |
ideparture is the publishing in the]
| issue of some prize stories of mem- ;
: bers of the faculty in the Fables
! page.
There will also be some art work
' by Gilman Gist Jr., on the physiog
! nomy of faculty. Other aiders and j
abetters of the back to the infirm
movement are such artists as Dick
Stark, Rodell Johnson (a newcomer!
j with a style much like that of the
I late-great Algar), Dick Dawson, and
j Curtis Barnes.
