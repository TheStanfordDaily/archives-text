# COMPOSERS TO GIVE PROGRAM
## Stravinsky, Dushkin Give Concert Tomorrow 
### 
Appearing under the auspices of
the Associated Students Concert
Series, Igor Stravinsky, outstanding
pianist-composer, will make his
debut on the Stanford campus to
morrow night at 8:20 o'clock in the
Pavilion. Assisting Stravinsky in his
concert will be Samuel Dushkin,
eminent American violinist-com-

poser.
The joint performance of these
two well-known musicians marks
the culmination of a long search
by Stravinsky to find an artist
who could give his works their
proper interpretation. As com
poser of controversial masterpieces
which present unusual difficulties
to performers, Stravinsky has al
ways been at odds with other
musicians.
Stravinsky met Samuel Dushkin
for the first time in 1930, and recog
nized in him that spark of greatness
that could assist him. Dushkin was
already noted for his compositions
and transcriptions, and a successful
tour throughout America and Eur
ope had proved him to be one of
the foremost violinists. Stravinsky
and Dushkin immediately collabor
ated on the composition of a concerto
for violin and orchestra and went on
tour through the European capitals.
