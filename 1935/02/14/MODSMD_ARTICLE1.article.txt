# Eighty-One Macon Survivors Land as Navy Mourns Loss
## Cause Underlying Dirigible Disaster Still Remains Unknown to Crew 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO. Feb. 13 (/P)—
How the dirigible Macon, the Amer
ican navy's queen of the air, reared
and plunged crazily through the
skies for 35 minutes before sinking
to the bottom of the Pacific was re
vealed here today in the stories of its
survivors.
The underlying cause of the mid
air collapse remained undeter
mined, but Commander 11. V.
Wiley and others who enne
through safely revealed there had
been a sudden lurch at the outset,
after which the great sky cruiser
soared upward, out of control,
then settled haphazardly to a
watery grave.
Outwardly light-hearted, the 31
surviving officers and men who
stuck with the ship until she hit the
water and then got away in rubber
lifeboats, sang as they came ashore
here.
Search was continued for the two
missing members of the crew at ihe
spot where the big ship went down
late yesterday 13 miles off Point
Sur, Calif. Point Sur is 110 miles
south of here.
The loss of the $2,450,000 Macon
left the American navy without a
fighting dirigible. Germany's Graf
Zeppelin, slightly smaller than the
Macon, thus became queen of the
skies..

BERLIN, Feb. 13 (/P) —With point
ed references to the performance of
the German Graf Zeppelin, Ger
many's newspapers today printed
first-page accounts of # the wreck of
the U. S. S. Macon.
Tlie newspaper Angriff, owned by
Herman Wilhelm Goebbels, minister
of propaganda, carried as its page
one banner:
"Macon wrecked because of faulty
construction."
Without fail, the newspapers called
attention to the safe performance
of the Graf Zeppelin which operates
on a regular schedule across the
south Atlantic from Germany to
Brazil.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 13 —
America's navy will continue for
the present without a giant fight
ing dirigible.
President Roosevelt gave this
word today while discussing the
Macon crash, but distinctly re
served a final decision on the place
of lightcr-than-air craft in mili
tary service.
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 13 (/P) —
Governor Merriam of California
today asserted that the navy should
construct another dirigible to re
place the Macon because of the
needs of national defense.
