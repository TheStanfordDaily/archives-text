# HAUPTMANN FACES CHAIR
## Death Penalty Is Fixed by Judge; Reilly To Appeal Trenchard Condemns Bruno To Die in Jersey In March 
### 
FLEMINGTON, N. J., Feb. i;> (/}')
—A solemn mandate—dealh in the
I electric chair for the kidnap-murder
of the infant Charles Augustus
Lindbergh, Jr.—was read to Ilruno
Richard Hauptmann by his New-
Jersey jury and his judge tonight.
Pale and erect, he heard the sen
tence of the jury that "we find the
| defendant guilty of murder in the
| first degree," and he swayed almost
i imperceptibly as Justice Thomas W.
Trent-hard sentenced him to die in
i the electric chair at Trenton peni
, tentiary "the week beginning Mon
j day, the eighteenth day of March,
1 19.33.'"
| But he crouched at midnight on
i the edge of the cot in his guarded
j cell and wept.
He had not a word for the men'
j who watched him.
Shortly after the jury climaxed
; 32 days of crashing, dramatic testi
mony and frenzied pleading with its
. verdict, Edward J. Reilly, "big chief' :
of the defense counsel, announced
that an appeal would be carried to
the highest court of the country, the
; United States Supreme Court, if
necessary.
"We believe that we shall be
able to secure an ultimate reversal
the appeal is expected to be the
of judgment," Reilly said.
The fh'st higher court to pass on
, the appeal is expected to be the
Court of Errors and Appeals of the
State of New Jersey and the case
probably will not reach that tribunal
before the latter part of May.
The father whose baby died at
a kidnaper's bands three years
ago next March I—Col. Charles A.
Lindbergh—did not hear the jury's
i mandate, did not see Hauptmann
as he stood, white and unshaven,
to hear his doom.
i Col. Lindbergh had left the court
room early in ihe afternoon, and
when New Jersey authorities tele
phoned the home of his mother-in
law at Englewood they were in
formed that the household had
learned the verdict over the radio.
The colonel and his wife were re
ported "not at home."
