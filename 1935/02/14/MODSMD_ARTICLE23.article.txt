# Dutch Dates? The Woman Never Pays
## 
### 
Bright ideas trickle forth from the Campus
Opinion column at irregular intervals, hut
lliis morning's brainstorm is out in front.
Two young, uninitiated Stanford roughs
have decided that we arc in the midst of
something of far greater import than a mere
economic depression. We are faced with a
dating drought at home on the Farm.
Stanford men, it seems, look upon an oc
casional date with the lady fair as a tremen
dous boon to humanity. Finances are low and
most of them can't stand the deficjt incurred
by embarking with the Hay Region Expedi
tionary Forces on a tour of the swanky hotels
and clubs of the district.
In 1931 the same question came to a bead
with the formation of a Bachelors' Club at
the University of Arizona, where the Bache
lors agreed that henceforth all Arizona women
would bear their share of the expenses of any
and all dates. This "dutch dale" idea was
laughed at by many and fondly advocated by
the Bachelors. Even some of the women saw
the point.
In 1931, the Daily, recognizing the danger
of the situation, refrained from advocating
any similar mass action on the Stanford cam
pus, and remarked that "it is perfectly pos
sible for the puzzle to be worked out between
individuals," Meaning that whosoever dared
to dale could take the consequences if he
dared suggest.
Today we glance in at the San Francisco
hotels on a week-end and find them packed
with Stanford people. Yet, only a fraction of
those who would really care to enjoy them
selves :;i this manner if they could all'ord the
outing more often.

Vet, is is just as well. One finds more men
on Ibis campus who thoroughly enjoy them
selves us the Stanford roiujli always has done.
Money and dales don't matter, and a lio-cent
ticket lo a local theatre provides a good eve
ning's entertainment. Bull sessions and beer
busts haven't died out entirely.
And women really aren't the crying need of
every Stanford man ii those women demand
expensive attention «iid entertainment.
The Daily doesn't believe that the majority
of Stanford women are of this caliber. You
will lind that most of them enjoy a good time
regardless of the cash expended. These are
the kind you'll like and prefer being in their
company.
As far as the dutch date idea goes, all well
and good if the individual parlies to the con
tract mutually agree. Certainly when the ex
pensive dates come along, as once in a while
they do, the intelligent woman will be glad lo
do her part it Ihe situation demands.
Many Stanford women during the past few
years have paid their share of dating expenses
when the outlay was high. The campus is
proud of these co-eds.
Bid the best way to enjoy the simple things
in life is to take them as they come, enjoy
them and when the Hough dates, let hint do
so ;it a maximum of enjoyment and minimum
of expenditure.
We do not have to go to San Francisco to
enjoy ourselves.
