# Our Third Dirigible Crashes

With a hopeless sense of ('utility, thousands
of people Tuesday heard the radio Hashes
and read screaming headlines describing the
doom of the Macon, giant dirigible.
The history of this mode of living in the
t'nited States has been tragic. Three great
dirigibles, the Shenandoah, the Akron, and
now its great sister ship, the Macon, have fol
lowed each other to destruction. These great
airships, constructed by expert engineers at
a cost to the t niled States of over eight mil
lion dollars, have thus far proved to be costly
experiments.
The natural tendency is for immediate and
violent condemnation of this mode of lighter
