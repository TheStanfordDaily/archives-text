## MAKING THE U. S. SAFE FOR DEMOCRACY 
### CROMPTON BANGS, Jr 
BOSTON, Mass., Feb. 12.—The U.S. is supposed to
I have entered the war to "Make the World Safe tor
i Democracy." Today theie are signs that we will have
| to do something to make the United States safe for
| Democracy and do it soon. The signs consist of Huey
Long and other professional friends of the people. The
| way to get rid of them is down in black and white in
I our Constitution, And until we do get rid of them,
; Democracy will be anything but safe.
From what you have read in The Dally and
elsewhere there isn't much doubt thut Louisiana is
run by Kingfish Long *vnd his stooges. You may not
have read that Iluey is giving most of the people of
his state what they want. But that is just what he
is doing—and it's costing plenty. This doesn't*
worry the Kingfiish or his followers a bit. They
are going to soak the rich.
There are still a few people in Louisiana who are
worried about losing their liberties, but there aren't
j many of them. It's so much nicer to get something for
i nothing and have the rich pay for it. That's why the
Senator from Louisiana has the support he has. Nobody
doubts that Huey got rid of the state's semi-feudal
grafting system of government; for that they are
thankful. Neither does anybody doubt that they have
less liberty, more political job and more graft under
the Long dictatorship.
' As far as that goes, it's no better or no worse than
' machine politics in many states. But Huey is very
i ambitious and wants to run everything. So far he has
j succeeded in running just about everything in his
| home state and is reported to be getting ready to run
I the country in 1936, or in 1940 if times aren't bad enough
J next year. Having set up a dictatorship in Louisiana,
| he wants to do the same for the U. S.
Like other professional friends of the people the
i Kingfish has both hands in the people's pockets. If Huey
promises that every man shall be a king and have
i $5000 in every sock, you L3n be sure that Huey will be
1 twice a king and have twice as much in his socks, He
j is out for nobody's good but his own, but like all rabble
! raisers he can persuade the people he is their friend
j and can do no wrong.
If times don't get better this year Huey Long
will have a swell chance of being the next Presi
dent. If that happens, God help these United
! States. We have to remember that soaking the rich
is very popular now, even though you arc indirectly
j soaking the poor at the same time. But that doesn't
bother Huey; ail he wints is a slogan to get elected.
And unless something substantial is done for the
ever-increasing numbers of jobless old people,
and done this year, the Senator from Louisiana will
get his chance.
Before this happens there is something we can do.
j That something is federal intervention. Article IV,
! Section 4 of the Constitution guarantees a Republican
) form of government to every state. The government
I of Louisiana is certainly not Republican: it is a Dic
, tatorship and nothing else. Without Huey Long it
I would fall to pieces in a few months. So if the President
| has enough courage to do it he ought to procede to
j take over the government of Louisiana and put the
Kingfish in a safe place for a while.
This may sound like Dictatorship, too. It isn't. We
! can tolerate weak Communists, weak Fascists and
; weak Dictators as long as they have no chance oi
.success. But when they get too sti'ong or too dan
gerous, it's time to step on them. There's no sense in
allowing the use of liberty to crush liberty. Liberties
and Democracy belong only to those who are willing
i to preserve them. When they are in danger it is high
time to suppress the danger with whatever means the
law allows. Now's the time to start on Huey.
