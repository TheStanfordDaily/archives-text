# OUR HASHER SEZ:
## 
### 
Many have been the theories about the decline and
fall of the Macon, but the hashers, who ought to know,
say it must have been stomach trouble.
There have been more theories advanced by Staf
ford students about what to do with the Sunnyvale
hangar. Mellinkoff suggests the New Theatre. Others
have suggested that it be converted into a football
stadium, with four or five fields and a revolving
grandstand; handball courts; garages for Toyon and
Branner: and an annex to the Phi Delt house, to hold
this year's pledge class. Latest thoughtâ€”either indoor
track, or a Greater Pavilion.
Personally, we think it would make a darn good
wind tunnel. Or, they could put in sun lamps and grow
avocadoes.
The Phi Delt varsity, with Robert Grayson,
hasher and history major, as a nucleus of a brilliant
running attack, took on the pledge class last Satur
day in a touch foothill game and could only come
out with a score of W-6. The game, which many
took to be the rugby game, attracted a large crowd
of interested parties.
Proof that once hashing gets into the blood, there
is little can stop it before rigor mortis sets in, is the
news that a certain Mr. Mosher of the "Z-P Club"
pays his house bill, but continues to hash for the
pleasure of it.
Hashing also has a profound influence on the fate
of empires and destiny of mankind. Picture this tender
little scene of last Saturday: The frosh were playing
Alameda High in baseball. It is the ninth inning. The
frosh are leading 4-3. Alameda High is at bat. There
are two out and two men on. The man at bat hits
a hard one and beats the throw to first by a stride.
Umpire Ray Forsythe bawls: "Yer out!" The man at.
first tears his hair and ca.st.s aspersions on Forsythe's
integrity. Says Forsythe: "Yeh, I know you were safe,
but it's getting along towards 12 o'clock and I gotta go
home and hash."
The big show continues at Ex Committee meet
ing next week with a changed cast. (While the
students pay the double bill.)
