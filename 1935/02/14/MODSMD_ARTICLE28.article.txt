Macon, the United States' Navy's
giant juggernaut, has crashed to an
ignominious ocean grave. As this is
written, two-and-one-hulf-million
dollars and two men lie dead in
'(he water oft Point Sur. To the fish
who sometimes swim in the cola
water off Point Sur, the Macon dis
aster is annoying. American
Public, it can only bring a vague
feeling of kinship with the lesser
fish of the Monterey Coast. For we
are certainly suckers, if not also poor
fish.
Everyone, except the people who
are supposed to know, believes that
money invested in fighting Zeppelins
is so much money wasted. With the
tremendous improvement in heav
ier-than-aiu craft, it would seem that
America can be adequately and eco
nomically protected with airplanes.
To this, the naval experts have al
ways replied that for scouting pur
poses the giant silver cigar cannot
be boaten.
Yet, unlike airplanes, dirigibles
can be beat by even mildly bad
weather. When the great Shenan
doah crashed, the excuse was that
one of the worst electrical storms in
history had hit the ship. When the
Akron went the way of all good Zep
pelins, again it was "very bad weath
er." When the Macon dove for the
fishes, the weather was "unsettled,''
and that was all. A beautiful night
for a walk.
If dirigibles are any good at all for
fighting or scouting purposes, they
must be good at all times. Unfortu
nately, war does not always come
with spring poppies and gentle
zephyrs. And a dirigible which had
to stay cooped up, or had to be called
off on account of rain, would be less
than useless when an enemy fleet
was headed for the stormy shores of
California.
In bad weather the zeppelin is as
useful to the navy as Indian clubs
to an armless man. In nice weather,
a bulging zeppelin is the most beau
tiful of aerial targets. *

Already reports circulate that (1)1
Communists sabotaged the Macon, or
that (2) Japanese naval officers, dis
guised as simple fishermen on the !
coast of Monterey, shelled the . hip |
with high-powered miniature can- i
non concealed in their fishing j
smacks. While that may sound like i
a good one to the navy department. 1
it will sound like baloney to the
public. And zeppelins will go.
We could probably get the Sunny
vale hangar cheap, as a New Stan
ford Theatre.

money invested in fighting Zeppelins
is so much money wasted. With the
tremendous improvement in heav
ier-than-aiu craft, it would seem that
America can be adequately and eco
nomically protected with airplanes.
To this, the naval experts have al
ways replied that for scouting pur
poses the giant silver cigar cannot
be boaten.
Yet, unlike airplanes, dirigibles
can be beat by even mildly bad
weather. When the great Shenan
doah crashed, the excuse was that
one of the worst electrical storms in
history had hit the ship. When the
Akron went the way of all good Zep
pelins, again it was "very bad weath
er." When the Macon dove for the
fishes, the weather was "unsettled,''
and that was all. A beautiful night
for a walk.
If dirigibles are any good at all for
fighting or scouting purposes, they
must be good at all times. Unfortu
nately, war does not always come
with spring poppies and gentle
zephyrs. And a dirigible which had
to stay cooped up, or had to be called
off on account of rain, would be less
than useless when an enemy fleet
was headed for the stormy shores of
California.
In bad weather the zeppelin is as
useful to the navy as Indian clubs
to an armless man. In nice weather,
a bulging zeppelin is the most beau
tiful of aerial targets. *

Already reports circulate that (1)1
Communists sabotaged the Macon, or
that (2) Japanese naval officers, dis
guised as simple fishermen on the !
coast of Monterey, shelled the . hip |
with high-powered miniature can- i
non concealed in their fishing j
smacks. While that may sound like i
a good one to the navy department. 1
it will sound like baloney to the
public. And zeppelins will go.
We could probably get the Sunny
vale hangar cheap, as a New Stan

Macon, the United States' Navy's
giant juggernaut, has crashed to an
ignominious ocean grave. As this is
written, two-and-one-hulf-million
dollars and two men lie dead in
'(he water oft Point Sur. To the fish
who sometimes swim in the cola
water off Point Sur, the Macon dis
aster is annoying. American
Public, it can only bring a vague
feeling of kinship with the lesser
fish of the Monterey Coast. For we
are certainly suckers, if not also poor
fish.
Everyone, except the people who
are supposed to know, believes that
money invested in fighting Zeppelins
is so much money wasted. With the
