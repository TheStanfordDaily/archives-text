# DANCE FOLLOWS SATURDAY GAME
## All Campus Affair Honors Members of Teams 
### 
Highlight of Saturday night's
campus social activities will be an
all-University basketball dance in
the Women's Gym. Gordon Heche
and his eight-piece orchestra will
play from 9:30 to midnight.
This dance will be the first of its
kind on the Farm. Plans have been
made to start immediately after the
conclusion of the Cal-Stanford bas
ketball game. Members of the two
teams will be guests of honor.
Pete Peck is chairman of the Card
inals committee in charge of ar
rangements. The committee hopes
that all those attending Saturday
night's game will proceed at once
from the Pavilion to the Women's
Gym after the final whistle. The
dance will be a strictly informal
affair more in keeping with past
campus tradition than recent dances
have been.
Among the patrons and patron
esses who have thus far consented
to serve are: Professor and Mrs.
Richard T. LaPiere and Professor
and Mrs. Philip E. Keller.
Admission will be fifty cents for
roughs and the women will be ad
mitted free.
