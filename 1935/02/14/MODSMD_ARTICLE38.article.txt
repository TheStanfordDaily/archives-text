# CARDS, U.S.C. IN RUGBY SATURDAY
## 
### 
Gridders will meet gridders Satur
day in the Coliseum when Cardinal
rugby forces take on Troy in the
oldo English sporte. It will be con
ference opener for the Cards.
About half of each team is re
cruited from the gridiron. The Tro
jans have A1 Reboin, Gil Kuhn, Bill
Howard, Cliff Propst, Inky Wotkyns, j
B<;b Rorison, and Ted Sloan, the lat- .
ter from the frosh.
The first six above-mentioned j
boys are backs and should have
learned enough from Howard Jones
to test the Card defense until it
hurts.
Eddie Kuntz and Glenn Leding
ham, two rugger veterans, lead the
S.C. scrum, which is reputed to
average around 210 pounds. In the
Cal-S.C. game last Saturday the big
scrum had the Bears stopped cold
with the exception of a few mo
ments when Cal scored the winning
points.
Another southerner to be feared
is George Merritt, who just missed j
a dropkick from scrimmage 40 yards
out Saturday. S.C. would have won
4-3 had his kick been a little closer
to its due course.
Coaches Harry Maloney and Jim ,
Wylie worked out the Cards yester- j
day, and will put them through an- t
other session this afternoon, and j
probably a light one Friday. Eight- :
een players, coaches, and managers |
leave Friday night on the south- !
bound.
Indian hopes are pinned on fasU
moving backs to outrun Troy's un- j
wieldy scrum and punch over tries .
from scrimmage. Ray Lewis, with his !
season's average of 21 out of 24
kicks successful, is another threat j
for points.
