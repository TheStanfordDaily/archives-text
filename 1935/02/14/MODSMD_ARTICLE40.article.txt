# VARSITY HOOPMEN WORK ON OFFENSE FOR BEAR TUSSLE
## New Spirit Shown Despite Slump After Three-Day Lay-off 
### Mort D'Evelyn 
I Picking up where they left off last
! Saturday night when they let the
i Trojans move away in the second
half to win 39-29, the Stanford quin
| tet polished up their offense last
i night for their next league game
1 with California Saturday night in
! the Pavilion,
While the whole team had trouble
! shaking off the dull effects of' the
' three-day lay-off, they resumed
i practice with somewhat of a re
! newed spirjt, realizing that despite
I their disappointing cellur position in
j (he Pacific coast conference ladder, a
j win over California is what Card
fans want more than anything else.
Bears Out of Race
The Bears on their part find them
-1 selves in the unusual positi'on of
I being practically out of this race,
! which is new for Nibs Price and his
! men this early in the season. Since
j their win over the Indians two
| weeks ago, California lost a tight
game to the Bruins in an over-time
! period and than came back the fol
! lowing night to win by a decisive
margin. Stanford may not face a
j Bear with the same spirit that it
; displayed in the two previous games,
! but last Saturday night's comeback
! proves that Cal is still out to win
! ball games.
Topping, Moore Star
In last night's Pavilion practice
, Keith Topping and Dinty Moore led
i the first string as far as the sinking
! of buckets went. Topping, who sur
j prised the U.S.C. fans last week-end
I by playing a vastly improved g3me
I over the first Stanford-Trojan series
I a month ago, was particularly suc
i cessful with his shots from the foul
; line and should be an important
i factor in Stanford scoring Saturday
I night.
The two forwards, Rod Bost and
I Howell Turner, have not yet shaken
the slump that kept their scoring
down to but ,one field goal apiece in
the Trojan series. Bu{, playing in the
familiar Pavilion, against guards not
quite so adept at blocking shots as
Eddie Oram and Hop Findley of
U.S.C., and with just a ball game at
stake, Turner and Bost should loos
en up and begin tanking shots as
they have earlier in the season.
