# GAEL VICTORY WILL PUT FROSH AT TOP OF HOOP STANDINGS
## 
### 
One chance remains for Ihe Stan
ford frosh basketball team to re
gain its top position in local fresh
man hoop circles. That .chance comes
Friday night when the Cards play
their hardest game of the season with
St. Mary's frosh in the Pavilion.
The Gaels have won 16 straight
games this season, carrying a sched
ule very similar to that of the Stan
ford frosh. Tuesday night while the
Cards were being whipped by Cali
fornia for their second loss of the
season, St. Mary's was maintaining
its undefeated record by trimming
U.S.F. freshmen by three points.
Earlier in the season the Gaels al,so
downed U.C. frosh. Both of these
teams have tripped the Stanford
team in the last two weeks.
Need Comeback
If Coach Jimmy Bradshaw's men
are able to stage a comeback to
prove that their last two defeats
have not been true indications oi
team strength they will have rein
stated themselves in the top rolt
Saturday night the frosh play San
Mateo J.C., another strong squad
which has lost but one game this
season.
Following Stanford's defeat at
California Tuesday there was talk
of re-scheduling a third game be
tween the teams since each has won
one tilt this season. According U
Bradshaw, a verbal agreement was
drawn at the beginning of the sea
son providing for a game on Feb
ruary 23, but through some erroi

| California scheduled another game
| on this date and was forced to post
pone the Stanford gome until March
2. This latter day proved unsatisfac
] tory for Indian hoopmen since four
I of the first stringers are needed in
track and baseball activities and did
' not wish to carry the season so late
: in the year.
Pates Conflict
February 22 is the only open date
on California's schedule and Stan
; ford is slated to play Piedmont High
j School that night. However, Brad-

Shaw is investigating the possibili
ties of juggling the dates in order to
play Piedmont the 2."1 d and the Bears
on t-hn 22d should U.C. wish to meet
in a third "Little Big Game" to set
tle the existing tie. The Cardinal
coach is waiting fen* word from Cali
fornia on the matter.
The Freshman Supper Club will
r.toeet in the Y.M.C.A. rooms at 5:!U)
o'clock tonight. Anyone planning to
come may make 'reservations by
o'clock in the 'Y' office.
