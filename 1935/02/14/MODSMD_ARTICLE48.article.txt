FAVOR PEP IN DAILY
The Editor, Sir:
1 have been following your Daily !
ever since I have been here and !
today when I read the article on,
"Versatile Beattie," I realized that \
this is just what the paper has been j
lacking. Do yoti know that there i
| have been more comments on that |
particular article than any other you j
have ever printed? It had human!
interest, life, and pep, the things'
' that everyone is inteiested in.
I I should suggest that you try to j
! get more such "news" and help the j
i poor studuits along. I find from my
own personal experience here at!
Stanford that everyone appreciates j
reading about some one person in
1 particular rather than a group of j
people connected with some group
j activity.
Why not try having personal in- j
1 terviews with different students on
j the campus to get their ideas and,
ambitions? Everyone has an interest |
' in such a thing and I see no reason
I why you couldn't promote the in- I
j terest of the students by having these I
| personal interviews with different
• ones.
The article on Yvonne Beattie was I
j an excellent one and should be fol

lowed up with another one.
Hoping you will accept my humble
suggestion, 1 remain your inspired
but somewhat obtuse friend.
