# DUTCH-TREAT DATES?
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Society has thrown college men
into bonds—bonds of financial em
barrassment. We are slaves to an
institution which has firmly rooted
itself into the social plan of our good
home, the campus.
Assuming that the girls and boys
come to school with the same
amount of money behind them, why
should the boy be taken in for more?
Simply because we are harboring a
useless institution which commands
that the boy must, in order to obtain
his social broadening, employ the
use of dating the girl—the girl who
has the same liquid capital for the
same purpose.
We maintain that the girls could
easily defray their part of the ex
penses involved. That which makes
this plea valid is the fact that many
girls see the practicability of such
an arrangement and would prob
ably be the first to back it up.
Suppose this plan were adopted:
dutch treats for all dates unless
otherwise arranged to the satisfac
tion of both parties. Then we could
call the "objects of our affections"
and calmly say (with no shame or
fear of a turndown) "How about a
date to the formal?"—receiving an
answer such as "0.K., and of course,
Dutch."
How many more dates would be
possible? What liberal spirit of en
joyment would prevail? Ask your
self these questions and give us a
chance to consider your replies.
Sincerely,
C.C. and R.G.
