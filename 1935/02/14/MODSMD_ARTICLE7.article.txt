# B.A.C. PROVIDES HANDBALL COURT
## Athletic Board Sets Aside $ 1500 for Project 
### 
At the Board of Athletic Control
meeting held last night, $1500 was

struction of four courts will begin

manager, and University architects
draw up plans.
Long congested because of bas
ketball and handball games going on
at the same time within the Encina j
gym, when the new courts are com- i
pleted handball will be played out- ;
side the gymnasium to solve the ;
overcrowded condition of the gym.
Pavilion Backstop
The four new courts will be built
against the back of the Pavilion
wall. Originally planned for use as
a backstop for handball and squash
courts,' the Pavilion wall will be
ideal to accommodate four courts.
The courts will be standard size,
and surfaced in the same manner as
the varsity tennis courts. The plan
for the new courts is temporary, but
will provide complete facilities until
permanent handball and squash
courts are built.
Replant Grid Field
In addition, the Board of Athletic
Control recommended that $450 be i
expended on the varsity football
practice field. The turf will be dug
up and a new field replanted for next j
season.
When the University of Keiou in
Japan sends its tennis team to Cali- :
fornia this summer, they will be
guaranteed some expense money by
Stanford, as well as by the Univer
sity of California and U.S.C., the
Board finally agreed, in voting $100
as their share of the guarantee to
the oriental team.
