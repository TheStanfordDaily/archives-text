# NEW HANDBALL COURTS TO BE STARTED SOON
## Construction To Commence Within Two Weeks, Al Masters States FOUR AREAS PLANNED Nine Hundred Square Feet Will Be Surfaced 
### 
Construction of Stanford's new
temporary handball courts will be
'started within the next two weeks,
According to word received last night
from Alfred Masters, graduate man
ager of the Board of Athletic Control.
Before this work is begun, ex
plained Masters, an enlargement
j√üiust bo made on the ticket vault
is housed in the B.A.C. base
ment. Soil will be removed to make
room for the vault enlargement and
be used to fill the site of the new
courts along the rear wall of the
Pavilion.
Reduces Gym Crowds
Although still far from perfect,
the proposed courts will greatly
reduce crowded conditions in the
Encina Gymnasium which is used
for both handball and basketball.
Nearly 900 square feet will be sur
faced with Lay-Kold, a trade prepa
ration similar to asphalt, end at
both ends high fences will be built
to keep stray balls within the terri
tory. Four courts will be layed out
against the Pavilion wall which is
ideally situated for this use.
Director of the Encina Gymna
sium, Dr. Andrew Storey, expressed
his opinion on the matter. "The new
courts will furnish much better fa
cilities on clear warm days but, of
course, they will not be as satisfac
tory as those we have planned in the
proposed Intramural Gymnasium."
Mural Gym Planned
The new gym, plans for which
were drawn several years ago, would
be built between the Encina Gym,
the Pavilion and the swimming
pools, would house squash and hand
ball courts and intramural athletic
facilities. Construction of this new
building, delayed by depression fi
nancial reductions, will be started
when adequate resources are ob
tained, Storey further explained.
The four-walled courts called for
in the new gym plans will be more
j-ptiteiactory than the one-walled
courts soon to be built, but both
Masters and Storey expressed thei:
beliefs that the new work will great
ly improve conditions pending tha
construction of permanent and com
plete basketball and squash courts.
