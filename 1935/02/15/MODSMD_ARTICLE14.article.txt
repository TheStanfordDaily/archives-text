# Large Crowd Hears Stravinsky, Dushkin
## Two Artists Feature Own Unique Compositions 
### Ellamae Dodds 
Featuring their own strangely
exotic compositions, Igor Stra
vinsky, Russian musician, and Sam
uel Dushkin, American violinist,
presented a dual concert in the
Stanford Pavilion last night.
The music, so different from the
ordinary and accepted type, violat
ing all rules of musical composition,
was brought to life vividly by the
two artists. Strangely exciting and
disquieting, it stirred the Stanford
audience with mixed emotions. That
the crowd which almost filled the
Pavilion was fascinated could hardly
be questioned. That it was com
pletely plea.sed and satisfied cannot
truthfully be said.
Master of Rhythm
Stravinsky's work reveals a
unique mastery of rhythmic meas
ure -and orchestral color, but to the
uninitiated his music may appear
formless, tuneless and inconsistent,
jerky and even somewhat aggra
vating.
Stravinsky seems to feel the
throbbing restiveness of the twen
tieth century and attempts object
ively to construe a foim of art an
ticipating the future. The result is
a mu.sic very "different" and con
troversial.
Each Is Individual
Made up of unusual and often
seemingly inharmonious chords and
undertones, each new composition
serves up a new shock to the audi
ence. There is no repetition of ef
fects, no carry-over from past per
formances. Each selection is indi
vidual.
The climax to the program was
unquestionably the "Danse Russe"
from "Petroushka," the one selec
tion to which the audience really
responded warmly.
The Stanford audience, known to
have become wildly enthusiastic
over artists whom it keenly appre
ciated, was but mildly enthused over
the performance of Stravinsky and
Dushkin last night. Politely applaud
ing a concert which they felt they
probably should appreciate but
which they did not quite understand,
the listeners left the Pavilion with
out waiting for a single encore.
