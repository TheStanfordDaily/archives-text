# Defense Attorneys Prepare To Appeal Hauptmann's Case
## Sheriff Will Take Bruno To Death House Of State Prison 
### 
FLEMINGTON, N. J., Feb. 14 (/P)
Bruno Richard Hauptmann woke
from a fitful sleep today, a man con
demned to die in the electric chair
for the murder of Baby Charles A.
Lindbergh Jr.
Edward J. Reilly, chief of his
defense counsel, characterized the
conviction and sentence as a "mis
carriage of justice." He and his
three associates prepared to ask
a stay of sentence and start an
appeal.
The sheriff of Hunterdon county
announced he would move his no
torious prisoner to the death house
in the state prison at Trenton Satur
day. Mrs. Anna Hauptmann con
tinued a mournful routine of life
behind drawn shades in the yellow
frame house in v/hich she has been
staying.
Visit Prohibited
She was not allowed to visit her
condemned husband.
Hauptman's mother in Kamenz,
Germany, wrote an appeal to Presi
dent Roosevelt—who has no veto
power over a sentence meted out by
a sovereign state.
Reilly and his associates, con
fident the state will have to help
finance an appe-d,' planned to plead
to the public for a "Hauptmann
defense fund'' to carry on the
fight.
"The fight to save Bruno Richard
Hauptmann has just begun," said
Reilly. "It is one of th'; greatest mis
carriages of justice when mob psy
chology overcomes judicial calm."
Warning to Kidnapers
United States Senator W. Warren
Barbour of New Jersey considered
the verdict fair warning to kidnap
ers to avoid the famed justice of his
state.
The jury ended its 43 days of
enforced companionship shortly
before noon when its individual
members left the Union Hotel for
their homes under police escort.
The several persons who figured
in Hauptmann's arrest awaited their
rewards. Indications were they
would have to wait until any appeal
was finally lost. The state offered
$25,000.
The $14,600 ransom cache found in
Hauptmann's garage belongs to
Colonel Lindbergh who paid $50,000
ransom. He is not likely to get it
back until the state is positive it will
not need it as evidence in a new
trial.

fight.
"The fight to save Bruno Richard
Hauptmann has just begun," said
Reilly. "It is one of th'; greatest mis
carriages of justice when mob psy
chology overcomes judicial calm."
Warning to Kidnapers
United States Senator W. Warren
Barbour of New Jersey considered
the verdict fair warning to kidnap
ers to avoid the famed justice of his
state.
The jury ended its 43 days of
enforced companionship shortly
before noon when its individual
members left the Union Hotel for
their homes under police escort.
The several persons who figured
in Hauptmann's arrest awaited their
rewards. Indications were they
would have to wait until any appeal
was finally lost. The state offered
$25,000.
The $14,600 ransom cache found in
Hauptmann's garage belongs to
Colonel Lindbergh who paid $50,000
ransom. He is not likely to get it
back until the state is positive it will
not need it as evidence in a new
trial.
