# INDIANS, BEARS MEET IN THIRD TILT TOMORROW
## Close Rivalry Expected To Set Fast Pace; U.C. Has Scoring Edge CARDS OCCUPY CELLAR Anderson May Start For Turner As Forward 
### Mort D'Evelyn 
Coach John Bunn's Indian quintet
will meet Nibs Price's California
varsity for the third time this rea
son tomorrow night in the Pavilion
at 8 o'clock when the Indian faces a
Bear hoop team which not only
licks it by tradition but which has
already succeeded in winning the
two contests previously played this
year.
With the Trojans strongly grip
ping the conference title for the
second successive year, the game
will mean little more tlvw the
usual heated rivalry which exists
between the two schools.
California is three behind U.S.C.
in the win column with four won
and four lost, while the Cards are
in the cellar position.
Team Not Named
Undecided last night was the five
which Bunn will send on the floor
to open against the Bears. Howell
Turner, regular forward during the
season to date and high scorer on
the squad, has not yet broken out of
the slump which marked his play
against the Trojans last week.
Unless Turner gets his touch
hack tonight, Arne Anderson, vet
eran forward of last year and a
senior, may get the call. Anderson
has been swishing his shots during
practice the pnst few weeks, is
rugged enough to play his best
against the heavier California
squad, and gained experience
against the U.C. "grapevine" of
fense through his p'ay last year.
At the other forward position will
be Rod Bost, while Keith Topping at
center, and Dinty Moox-e and Robin
Lindsey at guards, will finish out
the five.
Bear Regulars Start
Nibs Price will undoubtedly start
the group which has played for the
Bears in all the league games so far.
Forwards will be Jack Koplce and
Ray Olsen, both of whom are well
up among the leaders in conferencc
scoring race.
Captain Dave Meek will be at
center, and Bob Feiling and Bob
Herwig at guards.
