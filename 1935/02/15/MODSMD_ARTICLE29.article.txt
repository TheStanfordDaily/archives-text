II is with a vague, groping feeling you might

the almost impossible task of directing the
editorial policies of Tin: Stamoiu) Daily.
The goodly lump in my unhappy throat

much the immediate product of genuine re- |
gret at leaving such a pleasurable place as
Tin: Daily, as il is a result of the deep regard j
I hold for the youthful sense of optimism
which impels you into the editorial chair on
Sunday night, at which lime some .3,(100 mem
bers of the Associated Students of Stanford
I Diversity can and will be waiting to take the !
lirsl crack at your glowing editorial beagle.
You will probably wonder, after the lirsl
week of it, why Tin: Daily continues publica
tion in Ihe face of it all. Half a hundred "ex
editors" join me in telling you that "you can
never be more than half light, and that only
on rare occasions-." You can always make I
people happy by praising everything and
everybody. You will make lots of friends if :
you assure the campus your paper is not run
by the faculty. You will make the faculty i
and the administration happy if you give
the*in a good paper. #
Rather interesting, but you will learn that
the administration doesn't give a tinker's
dam about who runs Tin: Daily as long as
it continues publication. Ray Lyman Wilbur
happens to be one of the leading educators ;
in this country who believes in student self
government, and one who does not permit the |
faculty to interfere with your efforts. You can
print anything you want as long as it is true, j
clean, pertinent, and courteous.
You are about to edit a newspaper that is :
managed and written entirely by students, j
You will have no "faculty adviser." Stan
ford likes to see the student given a free
hand to develop as far as possible on his own
initiative. You have a world ahead of you, 1
and the means to a successful volume arc '
many and varied.
Belter than an "adviser" in the normal
sense that has come to imply censor in most
universities, you will have a true and
counselor in Ihe gentleman who labors up
stairs in the Press Building nexl door. C.hil
ton R. Bush has been at Stanford only since
June In si, but Ibis new head man in the Divi
sion of Journalism is one who has a realm
of knowledge at his command.

If you seek information, ask Professor
Bush. If you are in doul»t, ask him. His I
judgment will serve to steady you should Ihe :
need arise.

Advice, coming from one so immature him
self, may be worth very little. But there are
a lew ideas that somehow clamor for cxprcs- I

sum. Weigh them, and choose.
In all your writing, never permit yourself
to become embittered against person or ac
tion. No matter lam you support or oppose
anything, remember that your own action
should at all times be based upon the best
knowledge at your command, the tacts in en
tirety, and that your own ignorance of the
oilier fellow's side of the ease will not excuse
you. Always know both sides. You'll be
much happier for having stood for that which
proved to be right.
When you lind something wrong, look into
the matter before printing an editorial about
it. You'll lind in most cases that the proper
authorities are only too glad to correct the
situation upon learning of its existence, and
then your editorial can cum mend the im
provement.
Don't be afraid to comment approvingly.
There is much here on the Farm that is grand
to be so near. There are persons in authority
who expend every effort to make Stanford
mean more to every one of us. Hut when
you criticize —do so constructively.
You will say that you can't praise too much,
because the campus will stamp you as weak
in intestinal fortitude and will cry for sin
other MellinkolV.
Hut there is such a thing as being too crit
ical. Whenever the urge to criticize arises,
write yourself a good, strong editorial, and
then take it home to bed with you to read
the next morning. Look it over, earelully,
and see if the matter is worth printing.
»j< J|<
Always distinguish between the individual
arid the yen era I welfare. Many will burst
into this shack demanding Ihiit you support
this or that cause. Don't let them bother you.
I know that you will not use your office for
any selfish or otherwise unworthy purpose.
Remember that your exercise of the right
of freedom of the press is restricted only by
fidelity to the public interest.
* * *
One thing I've learned above all else. Don't
ever take yourself too seriously. True, you
have a responsible, serious, anTI possibly pow
erful position to lill faithfully in the Stanford
community. You will be filled at times with
a righteous indignation against things and
people. Quite properly, too.
Odd, though, vibut what may seem all-im
portant to you and to me today will be for
gotten in the bustle of events of the next few
days, months, or years. Nothing is important
except that what you print he true. Forget
campaigns, drives, and petty arguments and
concentrate on putting out a good paper.
Then, when the occasion demands, your effec
tive editorials will come of themselves.
Don't, don't lose your sense of humor. Re
member that "the humorous shaft is far more
effective than the vehement one." In your
writing, there will be one good; namely,
knowledge. And only one evil; namely, ig
norance.
You will be templed at limes by the nature
of your position (that of guarding the best
interests of a friendly community) to pounce
upon the individual who wanders from the
path.
Avoid quarrels with student officers where
they are not necessary. The same applies to
faculty members.
Where you believe the issue should not be
side-stepped, go in with both arms swinging.
Don't lead until you are on firm ground
and then lire away effectively or not at all.
The student manager's office should not
trouble you. In all probability you will find
no cause for disagreement. Men Cave is a
clean, straight forward, well-meaning fellow
and honestly believes he is doing what is
light even when Tin: Daily and others would
legitimately disagree with him. He will work
well with you, though, as will Marvic Kahn,
whose Executive Committee is on hand to
really investigate before it votes. Rare among
like bodies, this year it has sincerely tried to
do the right thing always.
* * *
You are very fortunate in the ability and
the energy of the staff that will serve you.
That level-headed managing editor, Rob Cal
kins, will come in handy more than once.
Clever, able, dashing women's editor, Char
lotte Rurridge, will liven up Ihe gang.
Those two dependable associates Rob
Jones and Frank Orr— will contribute many
a clever line to lill the columns. And they'll
be faithful, will work hard — for you and
Tin: Daily.
Jusi a word, and we part. February to .June
is not very long. Enjoy every moment of it
and make each day's paper the hesl possible
for the campus to enjoy, because it doesn't
hist very long.
Don't let rumor and talk either worry or
discourage you. Don't be frightened by op
position. If you are rigid, stick lo it, and be
definite. Win or lose, you'll feel much better
for it.
* * *
Don't be afraid to recognize new ideas, and
never fear lo shoot at the stars. They may be
far away, and beyond your reach; but your
readers will think with von, and that is what
you should seek.
Four and a hal.f months hence, when yon
are sitting at lliis same typewriter, feeling
just ;is limp, out of the middle of things, as I
do now, you'll realize exactly how difficult it
is to bid adieu to Ibis newspaper and ils staff.
II is farewell, not goodbye. The best of

Ihe thoughts of one w ho is leaving Tin: Daily '
for the first time in three and one-half years.
II is with a vague, groping feeling you might
call il looking for something that just isn't
quite there that I deliver into your hands !
the almost impossible task of directing the
editorial policies of Tin: Stamoiu) Daily.
The goodly lump in my unhappy throat
isn't entirely as was the case wilh 1931 — so
much the immediate product of genuine re- |
gret at leaving such a pleasurable place as
Tin: Daily, as il is a result of the deep regard j
I hold for the youthful sense of optimism
which impels you into the editorial chair on
Sunday night, at which lime some .3,(100 mem
bers of the Associated Students of Stanford
I Diversity can and will be waiting to take the !
lirsl crack at your glowing editorial beagle.
You will probably wonder, after the lirsl
week of it, why Tin: Daily continues publica
tion in Ihe face of it all. Half a hundred "ex
editors" join me in telling you that "you can
never be more than half light, and that only
on rare occasions-." You can always make I
people happy by praising everything and
everybody. You will make lots of friends if :
you assure the campus your paper is not run
by the faculty. You will make the faculty i
and the administration happy if you give
the*in a good paper. #
Rather interesting, but you will learn that
the administration doesn't give a tinker's
dam about who runs Tin: Daily as long as
it continues publication. Ray Lyman Wilbur
happens to be one of the leading educators ;
in this country who believes in student self
government, and one who does not permit the |
faculty to interfere with your efforts. You can
print anything you want as long as it is true, j
clean, pertinent, and courteous.
You are about to edit a newspaper that is :
managed and written entirely by students, j
You will have no "faculty adviser." Stan
ford likes to see the student given a free
hand to develop as far as possible on his own
initiative. You have a world ahead of you, 1
and the means to a successful volume arc '
many and varied.
Belter than an "adviser" in the normal
sense that has come to imply censor in most
universities, you will have a true and
counselor in Ihe gentleman who labors up
stairs in the Press Building nexl door. C.hil
ton R. Bush has been at Stanford only since
June In si, but Ibis new head man in the Divi
sion of Journalism is one who has a realm

If you seek information, ask Professor
Bush. If you are in doul»t, ask him. His I
judgment will serve to steady you should Ihe :
need arise.

Advice, coming from one so immature him
self, may be worth very little. But there are
a lew ideas that somehow clamor for cxprcs- I

sum. Weigh them, and choose.
In all your writing, never permit yourself
to become embittered against person or ac
tion. No matter lam you support or oppose
anything, remember that your own action
should at all times be based upon the best
knowledge at your command, the tacts in en
tirety, and that your own ignorance of the
oilier fellow's side of the ease will not excuse
you. Always know both sides. You'll be
much happier for having stood for that which
proved to be right.
When you lind something wrong, look into
the matter before printing an editorial about
it. You'll lind in most cases that the proper
authorities are only too glad to correct the
situation upon learning of its existence, and
then your editorial can cum mend the im
provement.
Don't be afraid to comment approvingly.
There is much here on the Farm that is grand
to be so near. There are persons in authority
who expend every effort to make Stanford
mean more to every one of us. Hut when
you criticize —do so constructively.
You will say that you can't praise too much,
because the campus will stamp you as weak
in intestinal fortitude and will cry for sin
other MellinkolV.
Hut there is such a thing as being too crit
ical. Whenever the urge to criticize arises,
write yourself a good, strong editorial, and
then take it home to bed with you to read
the next morning. Look it over, earelully,
and see if the matter is worth printing.

Always distinguish between the individual
arid the yen era I welfare. Many will burst
into this shack demanding Ihiit you support
this or that cause. Don't let them bother you.
I know that you will not use your office for
any selfish or otherwise unworthy purpose.
Remember that your exercise of the right
of freedom of the press is restricted only by
fidelity to the public interest.
* * *
One thing I've learned above all else. Don't
ever take yourself too seriously. True, you
have a responsible, serious, anTI possibly pow
erful position to lill faithfully in the Stanford
community. You will be filled at times with
a righteous indignation against things and
people. Quite properly, too.
Odd, though, vibut what may seem all-im
portant to you and to me today will be for
gotten in the bustle of events of the next few
days, months, or years. Nothing is important
except that what you print he true. Forget
campaigns, drives, and petty arguments and
concentrate on putting out a good paper.
Then, when the occasion demands, your effec
tive editorials will come of themselves.
Don't, don't lose your sense of humor. Re
member that "the humorous shaft is far more
effective than the vehement one." In your
writing, there will be one good; namely,
knowledge. And only one evil; namely, ig
norance.
You will be templed at limes by the nature
of your position (that of guarding the best
interests of a friendly community) to pounce
upon the individual who wanders from the
path.
Avoid quarrels with student officers where
they are not necessary. The same applies to
faculty members.
Where you believe the issue should not be
side-stepped, go in with both arms swinging.
Don't lead until you are on firm ground
and then lire away effectively or not at all.
The student manager's office should not
trouble you. In all probability you will find
no cause for disagreement. Men Cave is a
clean, straight forward, well-meaning fellow
and honestly believes he is doing what is
light even when Tin: Daily and others would
legitimately disagree with him. He will work
well with you, though, as will Marvic Kahn,
whose Executive Committee is on hand to
really investigate before it votes. Rare among
like bodies, this year it has sincerely tried to
do the right thing always.

You are very fortunate in the ability and

be faithful, will work hard — for you and
Tin: Daily.
Jusi a word, and we part. February to .June
is not very long. Enjoy every moment of it
and make each day's paper the hesl possible
for the campus to enjoy, because it doesn't
hist very long.
Don't let rumor and talk either worry or
discourage you. Don't be frightened by op
position. If you are rigid, stick lo it, and be
definite. Win or lose, you'll feel much better
for it.

Don't be afraid to recognize new ideas, and
never fear lo shoot at the stars. They may be

Advice, coming from one so immature him

In all your writing, never permit yourself
to become embittered against person or ac
tion. No matter lam you support or oppose
anything, remember that your own action
should at all times be based upon the best
knowledge at your command, the tacts in en
tirety, and that your own ignorance of the
oilier fellow's side of the ease will not excuse
you. Always know both sides. You'll be
much happier for having stood for that which
proved to be right.
When you lind something wrong, look into
the matter before printing an editorial about
it. You'll lind in most cases that the proper
authorities are only too glad to correct the
situation upon learning of its existence, and
then your editorial can cum mend the im
provement.
Don't be afraid to comment approvingly.
There is much here on the Farm that is grand
to be so near. There are persons in authority
who expend every effort to make Stanford
mean more to every one of us. Hut when
you criticize —do so constructively.
You will say that you can't praise too much,
because the campus will stamp you as weak
in intestinal fortitude and will cry for sin
other MellinkolV.
Hut there is such a thing as being too crit
ical. Whenever the urge to criticize arises,
write yourself a good, strong editorial, and
then take it home to bed with you to read
the next morning. Look it over, earelully,
and see if the matter is worth printing.

Always distinguish between the individual

Remember that your exercise of the right

One thing I've learned above all else. Don't
ever take yourself too seriously. True, you
have a responsible, serious, anTI possibly pow
erful position to lill faithfully in the Stanford
community. You will be filled at times with
a righteous indignation against things and
people. Quite properly, too.
Odd, though, vibut what may seem all-im
portant to you and to me today will be for
gotten in the bustle of events of the next few
days, months, or years. Nothing is important
except that what you print he true. Forget
campaigns, drives, and petty arguments and
concentrate on putting out a good paper.
Then, when the occasion demands, your effec
tive editorials will come of themselves.
Don't, don't lose your sense of humor. Re
member that "the humorous shaft is far more
effective than the vehement one." In your
writing, there will be one good; namely,
knowledge. And only one evil; namely, ig
norance.
You will be templed at limes by the nature
of your position (that of guarding the best
interests of a friendly community) to pounce
upon the individual who wanders from the
path.
Avoid quarrels with student officers where
they are not necessary. The same applies to
faculty members.
Where you believe the issue should not be
side-stepped, go in with both arms swinging.
Don't lead until you are on firm ground
and then lire away effectively or not at all.
The student manager's office should not
trouble you. In all probability you will find
no cause for disagreement. Men Cave is a
clean, straight forward, well-meaning fellow
and honestly believes he is doing what is
light even when Tin: Daily and others would
legitimately disagree with him. He will work
well with you, though, as will Marvic Kahn,
whose Executive Committee is on hand to
really investigate before it votes. Rare among
like bodies, this year it has sincerely tried to
do the right thing always.

Jusi a word, and we part. February to .June
is not very long. Enjoy every moment of it
and make each day's paper the hesl possible
for the campus to enjoy, because it doesn't
hist very long.
Don't let rumor and talk either worry or
discourage you. Don't be frightened by op
position. If you are rigid, stick lo it, and be
definite. Win or lose, you'll feel much better

In all your writing, never permit yourself
to become embittered against person or ac
tion. No matter lam you support or oppose
anything, remember that your own action
should at all times be based upon the best
knowledge at your command, the tacts in en
tirety, and that your own ignorance of the
oilier fellow's side of the ease will not excuse
you. Always know both sides. You'll be
much happier for having stood for that which
proved to be right.
When you lind something wrong, look into
the matter before printing an editorial about
it. You'll lind in most cases that the proper
authorities are only too glad to correct the
situation upon learning of its existence, and
then your editorial can cum mend the im
provement.
Don't be afraid to comment approvingly.
There is much here on the Farm that is grand
to be so near. There are persons in authority
who expend every effort to make Stanford
mean more to every one of us. Hut when
you criticize —do so constructively.
You will say that you can't praise too much,
because the campus will stamp you as weak
in intestinal fortitude and will cry for sin
other MellinkolV.
Hut there is such a thing as being too crit
ical. Whenever the urge to criticize arises,
write yourself a good, strong editorial, and
then take it home to bed with you to read
the next morning. Look it over, earelully,
and see if the matter is worth printing.

Always distinguish between the individual

One thing I've learned above all else. Don't
ever take yourself too seriously. True, you
have a responsible, serious, anTI possibly pow
erful position to lill faithfully in the Stanford
community. You will be filled at times with
a righteous indignation against things and
people. Quite properly, too.
Odd, though, vibut what may seem all-im
portant to you and to me today will be for
gotten in the bustle of events of the next few
days, months, or years. Nothing is important
except that what you print he true. Forget
campaigns, drives, and petty arguments and
concentrate on putting out a good paper.
Then, when the occasion demands, your effec
tive editorials will come of themselves.
Don't, don't lose your sense of humor. Re
member that "the humorous shaft is far more
effective than the vehement one." In your
writing, there will be one good; namely,
knowledge. And only one evil; namely, ig
norance.
You will be templed at limes by the nature
of your position (that of guarding the best
interests of a friendly community) to pounce
upon the individual who wanders from the
path.
Avoid quarrels with student officers where
they are not necessary. The same applies to
faculty members.
Where you believe the issue should not be
side-stepped, go in with both arms swinging.
Don't lead until you are on firm ground
and then lire away effectively or not at all.
The student manager's office should not
trouble you. In all probability you will find
no cause for disagreement. Men Cave is a
clean, straight forward, well-meaning fellow
and honestly believes he is doing what is
light even when Tin: Daily and others would
legitimately disagree with him. He will work
well with you, though, as will Marvic Kahn,
whose Executive Committee is on hand to
really investigate before it votes. Rare among
like bodies, this year it has sincerely tried to
do the right thing always.

Jusi a word, and we part. February to .June

Hut there is such a thing as being too crit

write yourself a good, strong editorial, and
then take it home to bed with you to read
the next morning. Look it over, earelully,
and see if the matter is worth printing.

Always distinguish between the individual

One thing I've learned above all else. Don't
ever take yourself too seriously. True, you
have a responsible, serious, anTI possibly pow
erful position to lill faithfully in the Stanford
community. You will be filled at times with
a righteous indignation against things and
people. Quite properly, too.
Odd, though, vibut what may seem all-im
portant to you and to me today will be for
gotten in the bustle of events of the next few
days, months, or years. Nothing is important
except that what you print he true. Forget
campaigns, drives, and petty arguments and
concentrate on putting out a good paper.
Then, when the occasion demands, your effec
tive editorials will come of themselves.
Don't, don't lose your sense of humor. Re
member that "the humorous shaft is far more
effective than the vehement one." In your
writing, there will be one good; namely,
knowledge. And only one evil; namely, ig
norance.
You will be templed at limes by the nature
of your position (that of guarding the best
interests of a friendly community) to pounce
upon the individual who wanders from the
path.
Avoid quarrels with student officers where
they are not necessary. The same applies to
faculty members.
Where you believe the issue should not be
side-stepped, go in with both arms swinging.
Don't lead until you are on firm ground
and then lire away effectively or not at all.
The student manager's office should not
trouble you. In all probability you will find
no cause for disagreement. Men Cave is a
clean, straight forward, well-meaning fellow
and honestly believes he is doing what is
light even when Tin: Daily and others would
legitimately disagree with him. He will work
well with you, though, as will Marvic Kahn,
whose Executive Committee is on hand to
really investigate before it votes. Rare among
like bodies, this year it has sincerely tried to
do the right thing always.

You are very fortunate in the ability and

Jusi a word, and we part. February to .June
is not very long. Enjoy every moment of it
and make each day's paper the hesl possible
for the campus to enjoy, because it doesn't
hist very long.
Don't let rumor and talk either worry or
discourage you. Don't be frightened by op
position. If you are rigid, stick lo it, and be
definite. Win or lose, you'll feel much better
for it.

Don't be afraid to recognize new ideas, and

Ihe thoughts of one w ho is leaving Tin: Daily '
for the first time in three and one-half years.
II is with a vague, groping feeling you might
call il looking for something that just isn't
quite there that I deliver into your hands !
the almost impossible task of directing the
editorial policies of Tin: Stamoiu) Daily.
The goodly lump in my unhappy throat
isn't entirely as was the case wilh 1931 — so
much the immediate product of genuine re- |
gret at leaving such a pleasurable place as
Tin: Daily, as il is a result of the deep regard j
I hold for the youthful sense of optimism
which impels you into the editorial chair on
Sunday night, at which lime some .3,(100 mem
bers of the Associated Students of Stanford
I Diversity can and will be waiting to take the !
lirsl crack at your glowing editorial beagle.
You will probably wonder, after the lirsl
week of it, why Tin: Daily continues publica
tion in Ihe face of it all. Half a hundred "ex
editors" join me in telling you that "you can
never be more than half light, and that only
on rare occasions-." You can always make I
people happy by praising everything and
everybody. You will make lots of friends if :
you assure the campus your paper is not run
by the faculty. You will make the faculty i
and the administration happy if you give
the*in a good paper. #
Rather interesting, but you will learn that
the administration doesn't give a tinker's
dam about who runs Tin: Daily as long as
it continues publication. Ray Lyman Wilbur
happens to be one of the leading educators ;
in this country who believes in student self
government, and one who does not permit the |
faculty to interfere with your efforts. You can
print anything you want as long as it is true, j
clean, pertinent, and courteous.
You are about to edit a newspaper that is :
managed and written entirely by students, j
You will have no "faculty adviser." Stan
ford likes to see the student given a free
hand to develop as far as possible on his own
initiative. You have a world ahead of you, 1
and the means to a successful volume arc '

Belter than an "adviser" in the normal

Advice, coming from one so immature him

In all your writing, never permit yourself
to become embittered against person or ac
tion. No matter lam you support or oppose
anything, remember that your own action
should at all times be based upon the best
knowledge at your command, the tacts in en
tirety, and that your own ignorance of the
oilier fellow's side of the ease will not excuse
you. Always know both sides. You'll be
much happier for having stood for that which
proved to be right.
When you lind something wrong, look into
the matter before printing an editorial about
it. You'll lind in most cases that the proper
authorities are only too glad to correct the
situation upon learning of its existence, and
then your editorial can cum mend the im
provement.
Don't be afraid to comment approvingly.
There is much here on the Farm that is grand
