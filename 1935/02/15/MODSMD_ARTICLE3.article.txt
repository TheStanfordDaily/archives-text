# Ex-Official Flays Abandonment Of Naval Dirigibles
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 4 (/P).
—A defense of the dirigible and
excoriation of the Navy Depart
ment for mishandling those air
ships the United States has lost
was injected today by William
Mitchell into capital discussion
of the Macon plunge.
Mitchell, former assistant
chief of the air corps, pro
nounced even the decommis
sioned Los Angeles—lone sur
vivor of four—"perfectly sound
right now" and told the House
Patents Committee which is in
quiring into the recent crash
that "for us to abandon air
ships would be just a sign of
moral decrepitude."
Mitchell said the Shenan
doah, destroyed in a storm over
Ohio in 1925, came to its end
because it was sent on an "ad
vertising" junket, over protests
of its commander, "to visit
county fairs."
