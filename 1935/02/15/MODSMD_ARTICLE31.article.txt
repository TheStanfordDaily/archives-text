LIBRARY LUNACY
Every woman, a lady; and every ;
man, a gentleman: that is the Stan
ford credo. But Stanford men and
women are only ladies and gentle- i
men as long as you avoid definition j
of terms. The moment you begin to
say, "A gentleman never does this," ■
and "A lady would of course never j
do that," the vision of Stanford no
bility—like Alice's Cheshire cat—
fades into thin air.
No one feels too much aghast when i
college men break down doors, tear I
open pillows, throw bedding and
beds out windows. That is the heri- j
tage of Hollywood movies. College
men are supposed to act like. that.
They feel ashamed if they don't.
Yet in a university (the seat of
higher learning and all that) it is
not too much to expect that college
men and women should acquire a ■
respect for books—especially books
that are owned by a library.
When little Junior, age six months,
rips pages out of the dictionary,
parents smile, and think that is a
sign of scholastic aptitude. When
little Junior, age 12, pencils a beard
on the picture of the Queen of Eng
land, that, too, is amusing. When
little Junior comes to college it is
time he began reading books, in
stead of chewing them.
The Citizenship Library is full of
once good books—drawn and torn
into early senility. It is not expected
that everyone should agree with
Darwin's theory of man and monkey.
But that is small reason for filling
the margins of the great man's
books with "oh yeahs," "sez you's."
and kindred imbecilities. The next
reader may be earnestly trying to
absorb "Darwin," and not a lot of
inter-linear lunacies.
Unfortunately, the depredations
do not stop with the Cit Library.
Upperclassmen are even worse. They
go in for large-scale foolishness. One
may perhaps excuse the fraternity
man's theft of a whole section of fe
male photographs on biological '
grounds. Still it just was not cricket
for a certain student in administra
tive problems to rip a page of as

signed reading from a library peri
odical. The esthete who made off
with 49 pages of Poet Lore, the blue
nosed crank who crossed the reli
gious references out of Kandel's
"Comparative Education," the econ
omy nit-wits who scribble through
Sir Josiah Stamp and the reverend
Bullock—such are not fit for the
University.
It is one thing to mark personal
notations in one's personal books; it
is another thing to mark notations
of any sort in books that belong to
the public.
—Dave Mellinkoff.
