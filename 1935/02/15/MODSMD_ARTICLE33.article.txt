NEW YORK. Feb. 13. — Noel |
Coward's new play, Point VaWne. |
is current at the Ethel Barrymore i
Theatre here, and employs the far |
from inconsiderable and immensely '
popular talents of the Lunts during j
its sultry course.
The play is not what we "expect"
from Coward with Private Lives and :
Design for Living in mind. And il j
we are so unkind as to recollect tht :
solemn, chaotic, pleading Post Mor- I
lem (unproduced) we shall be no
nearer to those expectations.
For it Coward has turned from
the bright, crackling comedy for
which he is justly admired, he has
not embraced the serious drama
with the awlul purpose which jog
ged through the hysterical, Arlen
haunted dialogue of the abortive
anti-war drama.
Coward's hand is still apparent
in one or two scenes of Point Vaiaine
but he does not obtrude into this !
play opinions which are likely to
elude him and overpower his better
judgment. Here he has constructed
with meticulous care a drama which
grows through two acts of a sus
pense which increases to a terrific
pitch and breaks with a crash at the j
opening of the third. His skill and I
his sincere appropriate determina- I
tion to stay within the limits of his I
play, instead of straying into delec- J
table fields of low and high but al- |
ways breakneck comedy, arouse my i
admiration.
The play is not a good play; and j
if it is a bad one it has been written, j
staged and acted with such skill that j
the audience is never permitted to i
think of its demerits during the per- |
fdrmance. It is swift, exciting, and j
compelling while you watch it,
whatever it may be in retrospect.
I am inclined to believe that the J
critics who reviled it with aspirity I
did Coward some injustice. At any I
rate, they should not have stressed
in their comments the fact that at !
the climax Mr. Lunt spits in Mrs. |
Lunt's face. That is, of course, non- ;
sense. It is the bestial, moody Stefan |
who spits in Linda Valaine's face, j
And the gesture is important less in |
itself than as a brutal piece of a j
brutal scene.
But Coward's extraordinary fa- j
cility with the materials of the I

drama have lead him to be regarded
with acute suspicion by critics less
willing to accept drama as such and
to be amused momentarily (or to
admit it) by such facility than an
audience is.

The play is related to the long
series of dramas which includes
Kain and White Cargo and. coming
at the end of a long line, stands up
very well with the best of them.

The play is related to the long
series of dramas which includes
Kain and White Cargo and. coming
at the end of a long line, stands up
very well with the best of them.

NEW YORK. Feb. 13. — Noel |
Coward's new play, Point VaWne. |
is current at the Ethel Barrymore i
Theatre here, and employs the far |
from inconsiderable and immensely '
popular talents of the Lunts during j
its sultry course.
The play is not what we "expect"
from Coward with Private Lives and :
Design for Living in mind. And il j
we are so unkind as to recollect tht :
solemn, chaotic, pleading Post Mor- I
lem (unproduced) we shall be no
nearer to those expectations.
For it Coward has turned from
the bright, crackling comedy for
which he is justly admired, he has
not embraced the serious drama
with the awlul purpose which jog
ged through the hysterical, Arlen
haunted dialogue of the abortive
anti-war drama.
Coward's hand is still apparent
in one or two scenes of Point Vaiaine
but he does not obtrude into this !
play opinions which are likely to
elude him and overpower his better
judgment. Here he has constructed
with meticulous care a drama which
grows through two acts of a sus
pense which increases to a terrific
pitch and breaks with a crash at the j
opening of the third. His skill and I
his sincere appropriate determina- I
tion to stay within the limits of his I
play, instead of straying into delec- J
table fields of low and high but al- |
ways breakneck comedy, arouse my i
admiration.
The play is not a good play; and j
if it is a bad one it has been written, j
staged and acted with such skill that j
the audience is never permitted to i
think of its demerits during the per- |
fdrmance. It is swift, exciting, and j
compelling while you watch it,
whatever it may be in retrospect.
I am inclined to believe that the J
critics who reviled it with aspirity I
did Coward some injustice. At any I
rate, they should not have stressed
in their comments the fact that at !
the climax Mr. Lunt spits in Mrs. |
Lunt's face. That is, of course, non- ;
sense. It is the bestial, moody Stefan |
who spits in Linda Valaine's face, j
And the gesture is important less in |
itself than as a brutal piece of a j
brutal scene.
But Coward's extraordinary fa- j
cility with the materials of the I

drama have lead him to be regarded
with acute suspicion by critics less
willing to accept drama as such and
to be amused momentarily (or to
admit it) by such facility than an
audience is.

The play is related to the long
series of dramas which includes
