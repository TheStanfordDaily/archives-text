# OPPORTUNITIES IN FOREIGN TRADE AS VOCATION LESSEN
## 
### 
For students interested in foreign
rade as a vocation, Dr. C. Gilbert
t'renn, student personnel director
|nd member of the Vocational Guid
ince Committee, makes the follow
ng statement regarding that field:
Foreign trade opportunities are
liminishing rather than increasing
,s a result of the present tendency
oward economic nationalization.
This conclusion was recently Stated
>y Mrs. B. A. Ochs, who has been
i buyer for Oriental products for
ears and who has acted as liaison
fficer between motion picture com
lanies and foreign governments in
he filming of foreign plays.
Jobs Scarce
Mis. Ochs believes that the Far
last is becoming industrialized and
hat available jobs both in industry
nd business are being given to their
iwn people just as fast as they can
>e trained. The need for outsiders is
teadily decreasing. Even American
irms are using the natives more and
(lore â€”sometimes in the most impor
ant positions.
The West cannot hope to compete
vith the cheaper cost of production
n the East. This means that each
tountry must raise tariffs to protect
jome industries. Mrs. Ochs believes
!hat as time goes on it is probable
jhat each country will settle down to
Manufacturing only what is needed
! or itself, and that foreign trade will
be chiefly in the natural products,
Such as oil, gold, wheat, rubber, furs,
litigates, etc.
For the movement of these natural
products, trade agreements and
reaties will have to be worked out
Detween nations and industries.
This work of delicate negotiations
,vill require good representatives
slid is the most promising field in
the foreign trade possibilities of the
future.
Cites Training
As training for it, a sound knowl
edge of business methods gained
Tom experience in almost any busi
ness field, travel and a constant
study of the psychologies and cus
toms of other nationalities are most
important prerequisites. A knowl
edge of commercial geography and
sf economic principles back of trade
changes is also valuable, while a
knowledge of languages spoken in
the East will be a decided asset.
In a recent conversation with Eliot
p. Mears, professor of geography and
International trade in the Graduate
School of Business, he agreed that
the viewpoints of Mrs. Ochs as ex
pressed above are probably quite
porrect at the present time.
