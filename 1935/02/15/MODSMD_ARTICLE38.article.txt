The Editor, Sir:
Reaction to the "Dutch Date"
Just in case you Roughs harbored the notion
That we gals wouldn't second your motion,
We wish to inform you right now,
We think your idea is a wow.
Your suggestion would seem to imply
The advantage is all for the guy.
When you tear Dame Convention to Hell,
Here's the story the ladies will tell:
It's no longer a question of "Palace,
And who can you get for friend Alice?"
It's no longer the play that's the thing—
It's you and the fun that you bring.
Though you formerly trusted your wallet
To captivate "What-cha-may-call-it,"
The day of your dollar is done,
And the lady no longer is won
By the Packarded twirp without graces
And the fact that he takes her nice places.
The gal will think twice every time
When she has to depend on her dime.
When we fear that acceptance is rash,
We'll say, "Sorry, we haven't the cash."
If it's time for old standards to go,
We just want to be sure that you know
That you haven't a chance
For a date to the dance
If we feel you're not worth our good dough.
—Coed Opinion—B.K. and C. O'C.
