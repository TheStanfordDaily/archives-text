# IC4-A AGAIN
## 
### 
â€¢ The Editor, Sir:
Your caption over Dr. Meal's and
Professor Hinsey's statement Mon
j day morning was most misleading
, in proclaiming as it did "UNANI
MOUS FOR IC4-A." It should have
read "UNANIMOUS AGAINST
IC4-A." This body of men, called
the Faculty Athletic Committee, na-
I turally operates upon the same pol
' icy as the 8.A.C., of which organi-
I zation the Drs. Mitchell, Storey, and
i Owens are apparently lifetime mem
j bers, that is, that once a vote is
taken it shall be declared for all
official purposes, to have been unani
mous.
Only once has this rule of the
B.A.C. been violated, and that was
I last year when the final vote which
; sent the victories band of seven to
! Philadelphia was recorded. A im
porter, who was not forwarned that
| it wasn't "correct" to mention the
| results of the voting, published them
i the next morning. It is interesting
I to note that the trip was won by a
vote of five to four. That the four
who voted against it were, strange
as it may seem, Drs. Storey, Owens,
Mitchell, and Pay Lyman Wilbur Jr.
The two votes taken against the
(IC4-A trip were based entirely upon
a lack of finances. When it was found
that the trip could be made without
incurring further indebtedness, all
three alumni members and the two
students other than Pay, Jr., most l
enthusiastically voted to send the 1
team to the one really great inter- '
collegiate meet of the year. The I
question of whether it was a repre- j
sentative meet or not was of course j
not discussed, for all of these men i
realized the importance of the Inter- |
collegiates, the oldest and best or- ;
ganized of any meet in the country, j

It was with extreme disgust that
I, along with many of the student
body, read that statement of the
Faculty Athletic Committee, declar
ing the IC4-A to be a little sectional
meet unworthy of mighty Stanford.
It was issued just on the eve of the
little band of seven's leaving and
put our boys in such a position that
they either had to win or become
the laughing stock of the country.
That committee's action was inter
preted to be the direct result of the
sour grapes attitude with which it
was afflicted when voted down in the
EA.C. It is my understanding that
the desirability of competition and
the financial capabilities of sqcuring
such competition Ls a question for
the B.A.C. to decide. Why else have
three alurnni members, men of such
standing as Dick Barrett, Husky
Guerana and Wes Howell? And
what a joke it makes out of the stu
dents' little representation of three.
The Faculty Athletic Committee,
appointed to watch over the schol
arship of our lads, has a definite pol
icy for such trips and it was made
permanent some eight years ago. It
says that no student may make the
IC4-A trip unless ne has a C aver
age. I would like to know what other
motive this committee could possibly
have had for changing its own per
manent rule, unless its defeat by the
student and alumni members of the
B.A.C. rankled pretty badly. Why
else should it step completely beyond
its jurisdiction and give the metro
politan press a laugh at the expense
of Stanford, which was quelled by
the marvelous showing of the team?
It is the champion now, and it is
befitting a champion to defend its
title. U.S.C. didn't do it last year,
solely on account of money. Are we
to commence following U.S.C.'s lead
in athletic policies? 1 hope not.
Sincerely yours,
George W. Edmonds, '34.
