# ITALIAN TROOPS GO TO ETHIOPIA
## French To Reinforce Army In African Colonies 
### 
ROME, Feb. 14 (/P). â€”Soldiers and
troops will be Benito Mussolini's re
ply to Ethiopia's defiant disclaimer
of responsibility for Italo-Ethio
pian hostilities in Africa.
A government spokesman said to
night no written reply will be sent
to Emperor Haile Selassie, whose
forthright communication handed to
II Duce yesterday blamed Italians
for the border conflicts.
Instead, it was revealed informally,
detachments of Italian troops will
start leaving Sicily Saturday for
Eritrea and Italian Somaliland,
Italy's colonies lying east of the Afri
can emperor's domain.
Dispatches from Paris said the
French government also would re
inforce her troops in French Somali
land in order to forestall further in
cidents such as the slaying of 17
French colonians January 18, for
which Ethiopia has agreed to pay
"exemplary damages."
Police Massacred
The police were massacred while
defending 200 French Somalis
against 2000 nomad raiders from the
Ethiopian province of Aoussa.
Troops and equipment in the
French colony are being strength
ened sufficiently, Paris officials said,
to disarm the tribesmen crossing the
frontier in flight from Italian or
Ethiopian reprisals. They are ex
pected to be concentrated at Dji
bouti, which, officials said, is "an
extremely important post on the
routes linking France with Madagas
car, Indo-China and the Indian
ocean."
In Addis Ababa, an Ethiopian
government spokesman declared
Italy's mobilization of troops is un
justified and may interfere with ne
gotiations for peace between Ethi
opia and Italy.
Council Meets
As the Fascist grand council met
to decide what action shall be taken
in the face of Ethiopia's initial re
fusal to pay indemnities for Italian
soldiers in border clashes, the gov
ernment spokesman revealed that
some small units of mobilized troops
already have left for the colonies,
adequately supplied with materials
for war.
Many thousands should have left
by the end of the week, he said. It
was learned 15,000 troops will be en
route within the week.
