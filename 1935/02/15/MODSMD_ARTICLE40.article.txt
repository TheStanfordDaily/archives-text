# Varied Events Recalled By Clubhouse's Hostess
## 
### 
Romances, weddings, comedies, ]
tragedies, are only a small part of
the many events which Mrs. Ethel j
Ewell, hostess in the Women's Club- I
house, recalls to have taken place ;
or had their origins in that building.
The big carnival today celebrates the
20th birthday of the building itself, |
and on March 1 Mrs. Ewell will look i
back over 19 years of service there, j
"When I first came here," she says
with a laugh, "I thought that we
were busy if one person came to use j
the telephone during a day. But!
now . . . well . .
Mrs. Ewell is a well-trained diplo- !
mat, for many have been the em- !
barrassing situations in that building
where so much is going on at all j
times. She laughs over the time that |
Catholics, Masons, and Christian
Scientists were to meet on the same |
night. Considering the Masons the
best shock-absorbers, she placed
them on the second floor and put the
other groups above and below. On
one instance she had to send an
American boy to get some Chinese j
students to attend a lecture by a
Japanese man because the crowd
was so small.
Many wedding receptions have j

] been held at the Clubhouse, among
them those of Blake Wilbur and
Lyman Wilbur, son and nephew, re
| spectively, of the president. There
i was, however, one particular recep
i tion which was cancelled—when the
couple found that their friends
couldn't drink their health in the
i proper beverages.
One night after a dance Mrs.
; Ewell had locked up the building
! and gone downstairs when she heard
wailing cries of "I want to go home." j
Wondering how a child could pos
sibly have been left there at that j
hour, she hastened to investigate. !
But instead of a child, she found a :
sobbing Rough, all of six feet, whom i
: she had locked out on the gallery '
j where he had fallen asleep during j
the party.
Interesting people from all parts !
I of the world have occupied the club
house guest room. Although it was
' furnished originally for women,
Mrs. Ewell enjoys hearing men j
! guests invite callers into their "bou- I
doir." She once apologized to a man i
"spending the night there because
the building was so noisy. His as
tonishing reply was, however, that;
he didn't mind at all. He lived in an 1
| asylum, he said, and was used to it. |
