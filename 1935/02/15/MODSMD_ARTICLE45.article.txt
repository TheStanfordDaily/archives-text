# WESTERN WOMEN'S PAINTINGS NOW ON STANFORD DISPLAY
## 
### 
Paintings by women artists of the
West are now on display at the
Thomas Welton Stanford Art Gal- j
lory. Still-1 ifes, character portraits, I
and scenery studies are included in
the exhibit.
Among the characters depicted are I
! Elberta Mohler Jones' "Peaches," a
child negress, whose black eyes and j
| dark skin tint are accentuated by the
pink dress she wears; and Blanche
Whelan's "Movie Director," effemi
i nate in Palm Beach garb, blase and
' cynical in expression.
The outstanding still-life is Jea
j nette John's "Easter Morn," a study
i of calla lilies in a glass vase.
Typically Mexican in atmosphere j
| is Florence Parker Boser's "Court
in Olvera St., L.A.," with its patio,
palm trees, cacti, and terra cotta.
Its warm tones are in striking con- j
! trast with the cool greens of Flor- j
j ence Young's "Yosemite Park."
Exhibited at the same time in an- j
other room are examples of the var- j
| ious graphic art processes: lithog
; raphy and etching, block-printing, j
, half - tone, photo - engraving, and !
| photo-lith processes.

j "Reform should be calmly and un- ;
i emotionally conceived in order lo be !
j effective, even though history shows
that it rarely is so conceived." â€” I
| James P. Warburg.
