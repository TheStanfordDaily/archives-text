# Trojan Swimmers Will Invade Farm This Afternoon
## Stanford Ruggers Entrain for South To Battle Trojans Coaches Expect Win, Point For Next Games With U.C.L.A. and U.C. 
### Warren Breed 
Eighteen Stanford ruggers leave
tonight for the South and the Coli
seum, where they will open their
intercollegiate season against Coach
Bill Haney's Trojan fifteen tomor
row afternoon.
The eighteenth man had not been
chosen lust night, but the choice was
regarded as being between George
Wyman, Ed Becker, and Primo Pin
otti. Marvin Taylor, who was origi
nally scheduled for the job, was de
clared ineligible because of the
freshman ruling.
Troy will put a strong team on
the field tomorrow, with half dozen
football men in the lineup. They
have been beaten twice this season,
in their first game, with Pete's All-
Stars, and last week by California's
last Bears.
Coaches Jim Wylie and Harry
Maloney are expecting a win over
the Trojans, and are already point
ing to the next two games, with
U.C.L.A. and U.C. The Card back
field line is fast and is learning to
pass better all the time, as well as
learning the art of the cross kick.
The scrum looked vastly superior
in the Olympic Club game last Sat
urday to any other previous show
ing, and if the forwards can func
tion as well tomorrow S.C. will take
another licking.
The probable Card lineup will be
something like this:
Jerry Peters, Dick Morrison, and
Fred Abbott, front rank; Jim Mullen
and Neils Larsen, second rank; Cap
tain Roger Hager, Frank Ingersoll,
and another, breakaway; Tony Cock
ing, actum half; Jim Trompas, first
five; Frank Alustiza, second five;
Ray Lewis, full; John ReLsner, right
wing; Joe Vigna, center three-quar
ters; Bob Mondavi, back. Substitutes
-—Anson Hayes, John Merritt, and
one to be chosen.
