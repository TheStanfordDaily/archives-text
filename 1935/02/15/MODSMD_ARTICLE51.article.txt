Southern California vs. Stanford,
j a meet destined to be the most spee
j taculur aquatic event on the Farm
j in years, is the bill for Encina pools
j this afternoon at 2:30 o'clock.
Led by five ail-American or
world's record holders, the Trojan
| swimmers will be the strongest out
! fit to perform in local waters since
! the days of the great Indian varsity
I three years ago.
i Record-holding Trojans wlio will

Jimmy Gilhula, national 200-
meter champion and holder of
j world records at 440 yards, 300
I yards, 300 meters and 150 yards;

stroke in 1932, runner-up at the
| N.C.A.A. championships last year;
j and Curtis Cummings, junior na
tional 100-yard free style chain
; pion.
Foster vs. Paulsen wiil easily be
: the outstanding competition event of
j the day. These two men, both breast
stroke champions, will race over the
200-yard course for what will vir
! tually be the breaststroke champion
i ship of the West.
Bob Foster, Stanford captain, is
the Pacific association champion and

! ern Pacific Association champion
i and holds the world's interscholastic
record of 1:07.6 for 100 yards. Both
have been pounding out the 203-yard
distance this season in around 2:38.
i So strong is the whole Trojan

lineup that the Indians have just !
i about one chance besides the breast- 1
I stroke to take points. This second
! chance is in diving. Tom Boothe, J
j who has been getting the judges' ;
| decisions around seven points con- \
| sistently in all his dives this season, j
! can almost be declared a favorite'
in his event, but S.C. is far from
weak in the springboard contingent, j
i First event on the program this ;
i afternoon will be the 400-yard
| relay with the 200-yard breast-
I stroke second. In both these races
! Thornton's men expect to give the
Trojans real competition. Jack
i Kuhn, Bob Hoover, Martin Sea- ;

tena, *>nd Walter Doyle will make
up the Card relay quartet. Both
Gilhula and Fletcher will swim in
i the relay for S.C.
