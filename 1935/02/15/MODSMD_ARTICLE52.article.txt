CARDS HEAVILY HANDICAPPED i
TOMORROW NIGHT

Card fans have long been prone to j
groan v/hen Nibs Price brings his ;
California quintet down to Palo Alto j
and the Pavilion for a "Big Game" J
i in basketball. The Bears not only j
j win a large percentage of the games |
i but also usually outclass the Indians. I
i Tomorrow night the same feelirg j
! of almost hopelessness hits Stanford
i followers of the hoop sport. Califor- j
| nia has won the first two of the four- i
l game series, the first easily and the
' second by determinedly pulling away I
in the closing minutes.

CAL'S WINNING QUINTET
! UPSETS DOPE

HIT BEARS' TITLE
HOPES LAST YEAR

MAKES LAST APPEARANCE
ON THE FARM

There are few who will admit that i
] potentially the 1935 Bears are better )
! than the Indians. Cal just seems to
• have the knack of playing her be. s t
ball against Stanford and the Tro
i jans, when a win means a lot. The
outlook last fall headed the Bt.-ar j

1
| for the cellar position in the coast
' conference. But six weeks ago when
league play opened Price brought
| out a hard-playing, rugged, and
| sometimes flashy team just as he
i has done for the past half-dozen
! years.
For Stanford 1935 basketball has
; been just "another on the chin."
Prospects had the Indians battling
ihe Trojans for the league title, but
j the Midwest trip, although defeats
I were expected, headed the Indian
for a downfall. In league play the
Cards have been kicked about as per
j usual, with a present summary of
; seven losses and one win.

For the Cards to come out of a
slump now. with the title way out of
reach, and trim California tomorrow
night would be something of a psy
chological victory as well as one in
I physical skill.
But the set-up is parallel to
! that of last year, when Stanford
i was out of the running but played
flashy hall for one evening, long
i enough to defeat U.C. and leave
the Trojans with the title,
j Perhaps Stanford will be hot to
morrow night. In her last game with
tlie Bears she proved to herself that
I she can win. A win over Cal tomor-
I row and another in three weeks,
I closing the season, would give the
! season a sugar-coating on the bitter
1 pill. And then Dinty Moore could
| win his $1 bet from Bones Hamilton.

Leading the California squad to
morrow night will be Captain Dave
Meek, closing three years of regular
treks to the Farm to uphold the
Blue-and-Gold in football, basket
ball, and track.
Big Dave has earned respect in the
first place for having the ability to

live up and better the tremendous
ballyhoo of a sophomore year when
he was hailed as the first three
letter-man at the Berkeley institu
tion in the decade, a great end, one
of the best centers, a potentially
50-foot shot putter, etc. He has made
good in each sport every year, de
spite a badly injured knee last year
which bothered him during the three
sport seasons.
Meek not only plays a game of
basketball that is beautiful to
watch, but has won the admira
tion of opponents for good sports
manship and clean play, which is
saying something here on the coast
where basketball often takes on
many aspects of the grid game.
