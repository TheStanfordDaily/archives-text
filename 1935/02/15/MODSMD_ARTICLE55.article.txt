# FRESHMAN CINDER TEAM WORKING BETWEEN RAINS
## 
### GORDY FROST 
Between showers the Stanford
frosh track term has been whipping
into shape for die first and probably
the toughest meet of the season
March li with San Mateo J.C.
Most notable of the recent im
provements was the performance
of Tom Collins last night. Run
ning the 220 low hurdles for the
first time this season, Collins turn
ed in a time of 2(>.5. Until yester
day the lrosli footballer had con
centrated on the broad jump and
high hurdles but his recent fine
showing at the lows will probably
make him Stanford's strongest en
try in this event.
Monday night Coach Bill Elling
ton outlined his course of draining to
the freshman team. lit requested
that quarter milers run half miles to
build themselves up, that milers and
two milers do three good miles twice
a week and that all men work out
on Saturdays and Sunday^.
The frosh coach also planned a
weekly schedule for hurdlers and
dash men. Monday they are to run
progressive relays, Tuesday hur
dles, Wednesday 352'5, Thursday
hurdles, and Friday participate in
the weekly inter-squad meets.
Meetings will lie held Monday eve
nings for discussion of weak points
brought to light 'in the previous
Friday's meets.
The froiili cinder schedule prom
ises to be a tough one this year.
Following the San Mateo meet the
Babes will clash with U.S.F. Frosh
on March 9, Peninsula All-Stars on

i March 23. Both these squads are
reported to have good material.
March 30 Ellington's men meet Sac
ramento J.C. and April 6 they meet
San Franc.sco all stars. April 13
the track team meets Alameda A.C.
which promise tough competition
and on April It) the season winds up
with the Little Big Meet with U.C.
Chances lor a Stanford victory in
the California meet are good at this
time but the Bear's habit of hard
work and rapid improvement may
I make a win difficult.
