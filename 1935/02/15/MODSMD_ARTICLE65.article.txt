# DEFENDS THEATER BOOING
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
May you call to mind the recent
expose by our worthy brother Mel
linkoff, whose gentle shafts of wit
were directed against the deplorable j
state of affairs which now exists at a
certain local Falo Alto theatre. In
short, I refer (in great pain) to thai
inhuman curtailment of booing. |
Booing is the customer's only gentle- i
manly manner of protesting against
the intolerable trash which the box
office sometimes offers in exchange j
for our highly respectable 30 cents, i

| The management of this sublime
palace can hardly deny that Stan
ford students represent a good heal
thy block of cold silver cash, who,
proving that it can take it, stubborn
ly, night after night, crowd the more
selective sections of "nigger heaven."
This old tried and true patronage
should deserve some concession.
However, the only return that it
i asks is a decent amount of amuse
ment for its investment. If not re
ceived it takes matters into its own
har>ds and instead of demanding its
money back or refusing to patronize
this theatre in the future, proceeds
to amuse itself in its own quaint
v/ay, which does not disturb the far
away rest of the house any more
than a juckrabbit does the Graf
Zepplin.
Therefore, I believe that the afore
mentioned brother Mellinkoff's atti
tude toward this subject is highly
1 commendable and I, for one, com-
I mend it heartily.
—Bud Desenberg.
(Note: I. too, was ejected.)
