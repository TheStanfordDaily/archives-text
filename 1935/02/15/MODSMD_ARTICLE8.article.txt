# BOOK CAMPAIGN QUOTA IS SHORT
## Cardinals Aid In Disposing Of Old Magazines 
### 
With only four days of the Cardi
nal book campaign remaining, the
desired quota Ls far from fulfilled.
The drive, as it develops, is be
coming nearly as much of a boon to
the students as to the Civilian Con
servation Corps in that it the
student an opportunity to get rid
of old magazines and books which
may have cluttered shelves all
quarter.
Nearly everyone has purchased
magazines and, .not having any use
for them after reading them, put
them in the closet or on the book
shelf merely to get the papers out of
the way. They now have the oppor
tunity of getting rid of them and
at the same time furnish amuse
ment for others.
Representatives in all the halls
and on the Row are at all times
ready to receive any contributions
which are readable. Books or maga
zines suitable for persons of univer
sity age are preferable.
If a representative cannot be
found, a box is maintained at the
loan desk of the library in which
any offerings may be left.
