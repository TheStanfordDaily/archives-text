BEFLIN, Feb. 14 (A J ). —Germany
tonight told France and England
she would be glad to discuss with
them an air pact for Western Eu
rope.
At the same time, she showed
little interest in suggestions ema- i
nating from London that she return ,
to the League of Nations, join the j
French - sponsored Eastern security I
agreement and adhere to the pro
posed Central Europe non-interfer
ence pact.
The Reich's note — awaited with
intense interest during the week that
Adolf Hitler, in virtual seclusion,
has been pondering his reply to the
Anglo-French proposals — was de- ,
livered to Sir Erie Phipps, British
Ambassador, and Andre Francois-
Poncet, French Ambassador.
