# Student Exodus Looms, Due to Triple Holiday
## 
### 
No Friday classes this week
and a holiday on Saturday
morning.
J. P. Mitchell, registrar, last
night announced, "since Friday,
February 22, is a University
holiday, the president has de
cided to include Saturday
morning."
The action was taken, ac
cording to Mitchell, in order
that all students, including
those who have classes on the
sixth day of the week "can
make plans for the week-end."
Saturday afternoon classes and
labs, however, will be held as
usual.
Class free Friday, the annual
observance of Washington's
birthday, will be the only break
in school routine until the end
of the quarter on March 22.
