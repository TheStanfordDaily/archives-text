### CEDRIC LARSON 
His alert, steel-blue eyes flashing with the restless energy which char
acterizes the man, Roger Rahson, a Stanford visitor this week-end, and
world-famous statistician of New England who predicted the 1 !*2!> crash
in the stock market, expressed optimism over the immediate economic
future in America, in an interview yesterday for the Stanford Daily:
A "T f.r.nz-ti + innc m;ilro Prpsi-

dents rather than Presidents make
conditions. When Mr. Hoover was
President the tide was running out
and he was not big enough to stop
it from running out —now the tide is
running in, and Mr. Roosevelt is not
big enough to stop it from running
in.
"Business just now is picking up
and I expect to see it improve gen
erally for the next two or three
years, and good times incidentally
means more positions open to the
college graduate of the near future.
"Tremendous social changes are
going to take place during the life
time of the young people of today.
Just what and when these innova
tions will be, time alone will tell,
but it is my personal opinion that
they will be in the direction of
fascism and not communism.
"I believe the best investments
which a young person of today can
make are in education, character
and health, for when upheaval
comes, you cannot depend upon
democracy, or the legislature, or
wealth to save yop.
"Personally I am a conservative
and believe in the capitalistic sys
tem. I am not, however, blind to
the impending changes in the social
order, which of course may be a
gradual transition, or sudden, or de
layed. Irrespective of the outcome,
whether fascism or some form of so
cialism, future leadership will de
mand from the youth of America
the same qualities that have won
out in the past: courage, health,
I judgment, initiative and energy."
When asked what ihe people of
New England thought of Pacific
j coast affairs in general, Babson re-
I plied nonchalantly: "We New Eng
| landers think of you folks on the
j West Coast as suffering from a series
; of inferiority complexes.
"You virtually seem afraid of
your shadows. One group is
alarmed over Japanese militarism,
another section is frightened by
the insecurity of old age, a third
| faction is terrified by the red inen
-1 ace, and a fourth group dreads the
earthquakes.
"We Easterners feel that you of
the West possess an empire—the
finest part of America—in natural
! resources, soil, climate, harbors, and
i oil. All that we have in New Eng
-1 land is 'guts'," the statistician con-
I eluded with a smile, "and that is
what you need out here."
! Roger Babson entrained last
night lor his 12,000-acre citrus and
cattle ranch in Florida, where he
I spends his winters. He was last week
i at Berkeley, giving the Earl lectures
1 at the Pacific School of Religion, be
! sides addressing numerous gather
i irtgs in the Bay region. He was the
week-end guest of Dean and Mrs.
Hugh S. Jackson of the Graduate
School of Business, and Saturday
night called at the Hoover home.
Yesterday he was guest-of-honor at
an afternoon tea attended by many
! faculty members and students.
