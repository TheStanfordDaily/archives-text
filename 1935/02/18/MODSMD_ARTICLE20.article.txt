# STATE, LAMSON DEFENSE READY FOR NEW TRIAL
## Both Sides Expect Battle Of Science Over Cause Of Wife's Death 
### 
SAN JOSE, Calif., Feb. 17 (IP)â€”
Indications that the second trial of
David A. Lamson on wife murder
charges, beginning here tomorrow,
would develop into a battle of sci
entists appeared here tonight.
Defense Attorneys E. M. Rea and
Edwin V. McKenzie said they would
rely heavily on physics to disprove
the state's charge that the former
Stanford University Press represen
tative beat his attractive wife Allene
to death with an iron pipe.
They announced they would at
tempt to demonstrate before the
jury a living model their thcory
that Mrs. L/unson slipped and fell
in the bathroom of her Stanford
campus home, struck her head
against a heavy enamel wash basin
and received a skull fracture
which caused her death.
Prosecution authorities were re
ported ready to bring in new scien
tific witnesses to support their
theory that Lamson beat his mate
to death with an iron pipe.
May Call Predecessor
Another report was circulated that
the state was overhauling its en
tire case and was considering call
ing an eminent professor to the
stand in its attempt to show there
was blood on the length of pipe pro
duced by the prosecution as the
death instrument.
District Attorney Fred L. Thomas
declined to comment on the reports.
That the iron pipe would again
figure prominently was a foregone
conclusion. After the State Su
preme Court reversed the origi
nal conviction and death sentence
on the ground that the state had
not proved Mrs. Lamson was slain,
attorneys for both sides joined in
taking a deposition from a former
occupant of the Lamson cottage
regarding the pipe.
This deposition was made by Prof.
George L. Harrison of the Massa
chusetts Institute of Technology.
Although its contents were not made
public, it was understood Prof. Har
rison testified the pipe was in the
I back yard of the home when he
lived there.
In the original trial the state con
tended the iron pipe had been lying
about the house and that Lamson
in a fit of anger seized it and slew
his wife to escape from an unhappy
marriage. The pipe was found in a
! bonfire which Lamson was attending
jin the back yard just before the
I tragedy became known.
Mrs. Kent To Appear
Defense attorneys said also they
j would present Mrs. Helen Kent, a
| sister of Prof. Harrison, to testify
j that she once slipped in the .same
} bathtub and almost fractured her
! skull.
Even the shape of the blood spots
I on the walls and' floor of the bath-
I room will form a part of the defense
| case.
At the first trial the defense tried
| to give evidence through Prof. E. O.
I Heinrich, noted criminologist, thai
! the formation and positions of these
j; pots bore out the accident theory,
j Superior Judge R. R. Sycr declined
I to admit Heinrich's testimony in that
j respect.
