WASHINGTON, Feb. 17 (/!')â€”A
Congress prodded by demands that
it investigate NRA before enactment
of a law continuing the agency prob
ably will receive tomorrow from
President Roosevelt his recommen
dation for a new recovery organi
zation.
The President has indicated that
he will ask for a simpler NRA which
will not have some of the wide pow
ers possessed by the agency once
headed by Hugh S. Johnson.
Officials have said that Section
7-A, which sets out labor's right to
collective bargaining, would be con
tinued; that the abolition of child
labor would be retained, as would
minimum wages, maximum hours
and other provisions affecting labor.
