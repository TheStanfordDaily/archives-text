gate of the state reformatory here
this afternoon, killing "Uncle Pete"

were recaptured by guards. Several
were wounded.
The bseak climaxed a series of in
vestigations of the administration of
Mrs. George A. Waters, only woman
warden of a male penal institution
in the United States.
Overpower Trusty
The prisoners were understood to
have overpowered a trusty handling
keys to a gate leading to the front
of the prison, getting through the
main gate by menacing the guard
there with pistols.
The gun fight started when they
fled down the front steps leading to
an isolated guard tower about 40
feet in front of the prison proper.
Guard Killed
It was there that Jones was slain.
Identity of the 20 prisoners figur
ing in the break were not known.
"We will check as soon as we dress
the wounds of the boys," Mrs. Wa
ters said.
Voice Breaks
"It has been upset down here
since they started their investiga
tions," Mrs. Waters said, her voice
breaking. She referred to recent
probes made by Mrs. Mabel Bas
sett, state commissioner of charities
and corrections, and the state board
of affairs.
