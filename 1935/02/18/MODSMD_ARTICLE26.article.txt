## Card Five Stages Last Half Rally; 4 Ousted For Personal Fouls TOPPING, KOPKE STAR Crowd Cheers Wildly When Card Comeback Wins 
### Mort D'Evelyn 
With a four-point lead taken dur
ing the opening stages of the second
half and held determinedly through
ten hectic minutes, the Stanford var
sity quintet downed California by a
158-34 score Saturday night in the
i Pavilion.
While having no effect on the In
dians' cellar position in the Coast
conference, the victory was Stan
ford's first over the Bears in three
games this year, its second in 1935
league play, and its third over Cali
fornia in a decade of Pavilion history.

Besides being a nip-and-tuck con
test throughout, the score being tied
i five times, the contest was one of
J the roughest seen in the Pavilion
j this year. Three California men,
I Captain Dave Meek, Bob Herwig,
; and Bob Feiling, and Arne Andor-
I son of Stanford left the game on four
! personal fouls.
With Meek scoring beautifully on
long shots and Herwig sinking free
i throws, the Bears took an early 14-3
' lead. Then Robin Lindsey and Keith
Topping of the Cards started scoring
from the floor, and the California
| advantage dwindled to 18-17 at half
| time.
Bears Expelled
In the second half the Indians
came back with a rush, taking a lead
through the tallies of Topping, An
derson, and Dinty Moore which
amounted to 213—25 with ten minut( s
to go. California then started put
ting on the ,pressure, but had the
jinisioitune of being charged with
i illegal tactics by Referees Lefty
Sproul and Otis Higgins, and Meek,
Herwig, and Feiling left the game in
; quick succession.
Passing calmly between them
| selves, the Indians controlled the
I game during the closing minutes and
: successfully halted the attempts of
fresh California substitutes to break
: up the game.
Topping Scores 11
| Topping played brilliantly for
! Stanford, tying for the evening high
I point honors with 11 and using his
| height to advantage under the buck
! et. Lindsey and Moore, the two
j guards, kept the Bear set-up plays
| down to a minimum and scored 18
| points together.
j California unfortunately was
! forced to go without the services of
| Center Dave Meek for nearly half
i of the game because of the personal
1 foul ruling. Mock, however, played
| long enough to tally eight points,
following Forward Jack Wopke, who
i accounted for 11.

With a four-point lead taken dur
ing the opening stages of the second
half and held determinedly through
ten hectic minutes, the Stanford var
sity quintet downed California by a
158-34 score Saturday night in the
i Pavilion.
While having no effect on the In
dians' cellar position in the Coast
conference, the victory was Stan
ford's first over the Bears in three
games this year, its second in 1935
league play, and its third over Cali
fornia in a decade of Pavilion history.

Besides being a nip-and-tuck con
test throughout, the score being tied
i five times, the contest was one of
J the roughest seen in the Pavilion
j this year. Three California men,
I Captain Dave Meek, Bob Herwig,
; and Bob Feiling, and Arne Andor-
I son of Stanford left the game on four
! personal fouls.
With Meek scoring beautifully on
long shots and Herwig sinking free
i throws, the Bears took an early 14-3
' lead. Then Robin Lindsey and Keith
Topping of the Cards started scoring
from the floor, and the California
| advantage dwindled to 18-17 at half
| time.
Bears Expelled
In the second half the Indians
came back with a rush, taking a lead
through the tallies of Topping, An
derson, and Dinty Moore which
amounted to 213—25 with ten minut( s
to go. California then started put
ting on the ,pressure, but had the
jinisioitune of being charged with
i illegal tactics by Referees Lefty
Sproul and Otis Higgins, and Meek,
Herwig, and Feiling left the game in
; quick succession.
Passing calmly between them
| selves, the Indians controlled the
I game during the closing minutes and
: successfully halted the attempts of
fresh California substitutes to break
: up the game.

| Topping played brilliantly for

I point honors with 11 and using his
| height to advantage under the buck
! et. Lindsey and Moore, the two
j guards, kept the Bear set-up plays
