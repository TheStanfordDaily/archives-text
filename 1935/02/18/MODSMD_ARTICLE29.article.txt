I)iit S i an :
There arc many things to say to you. Un
fortunately I have no proverbs :it my linker
tips, and I am afraid that if I did have, I would
not include them in this column. After all,
it \v;is traditionally your duty to write me a
letter, but it is a pleasure for me to be able
to answer you.
There is a lot to this idea that filling edito
rial columns with swan songs and "you were
a swell man during your volume," is just so
much gull'. Perhaps so. Hut there is some
value to gull', when it is sincere, and when it
is the Inst chance to put into print many things
that have been on your mind for some time.
Once upon a time on this rag, an unusually
good editor who came to the end of his volume
gave his successor some advice. Among other
things, he said : "There is a lump in my throat
as the result of a deep sympathy for the un
suspecting youth who is about to project his
eentcrboard into the open spaces where some
.'MOO associated students of the University can
and will take a crack at it."
That was all very true. It is the gamble
every campus journalist makes when he
takes the editor's reins in his hands. Whether
he conies out comparatively unscathed, or
whether he retires with much mud in his eyes
does not make terribly much dilVerence. What
docs matter is what he has done with his op
portunity to help the University.
I think that was your idea, Stan, when you
became the editor of the Daily last fall. There
were many times that you could have shied
away from controversial subjects. Perhaps
there were even times when you should have
done so. But you waded in and expressed your
opinions, whether or not they happened to
coincide with majority sentiment. And that
was a valuable thing because it made the cam
pus think about its problems.
There was that matter of the 15 cents Daily
money. It would have been very easy to allow
the Executive Committee to put it to other
uses. But you saw a legitimate need for it
fell that the campus would gel a belter paper
every morning were il allowed to use the
money tor improvements in the paper. As a
result the campus benefited.
As for thai Hearst business. It is not my
place to judge your ideas. They may have
been good or they may on the other hand have
been bad, but there is no one who can doubt
your sincerity of purpose. If there is one word
that probably bores the average college stu
dent more than anything else, il is thai trite
phrase, isms, but the reason it bores him is
because he may not understand its signifi
cance. Bringing the entire subject to
where it could be discussed and disposed of
was a healthy thing, and I believe that was
your motive throughout.
Well, enough of that. You know, it's a
strange thing. Four years ago there were a
great many juicy topics on the Farm for every
new editor to sink his teeth into. There was
always the theatre, there was Pan-Hell and
rushing. There was the question of the Union
prices and where our dollars went. They
spoke of bookstore graft, and tyrannical stu
dent managers.
Yes, they were all good for many fiery edits.
But that day is gone. Bushing is compara
tively placid, the prices of eolVee and orange
juice are down, we know that the Union dollar
is going to help pay for a new theatre, and
even our student managers seem to be pretty
well in hand. Nothing is left but our theatre,
and I venture to say that until it is completed,
every student editor will enthusiastically sup
port it, because it is a crying need, and be
cause now more than ever, when actual plans
have been laid, they should be carried out
speedily and at the same lime comprehen-

And so—►now it conies time to slop. Soon
spring will he upon us and the Lake a very
enjoyable place to visit. Another Daily editor
has gone by the journalistic hoards and can
now visit that place where so few campus
newspapermen are ever seen the library.
