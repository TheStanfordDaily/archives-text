On May 29, 1935, San Diego plans to play host to
the world in the opening of the California Pacific
International Exposition.
The significance of the fact lies in the increasing
importance of the Pacific area in international affairs.
It is rapidly becoming the arena of world trade devel
opments and commercial expansion.
San Diego boasts the title, "A Modern Eden,"
will spend $6,000,000 in preparing the 1400-
acre exposition site on Balboa Park. Congress only
recently passed an appropriation of several hun
dred thousand dollars to further federal buildings
and exhibits, which will be reidy to show this
summer.
Balboa Park is unique in that it is in the heart of
the city, which sprawls out over considerable terri
tory, having a maximum ler*gth of twenty miles and
width of ten miles. The park overlooks San Diego
Bay, into which Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo, the Spanish
explorer, sailed only fifty years after the discovery of
America by Columbus.
The exposition will follow in many respects the
plan of the recent Chicago Century of Pregress Expo
sition, and many countries and firms are moving their
former Chicago features to San Diego, after altering
them in detail.
Myriads of exhibits are contemplated by the
southern city. A Palace of Electricity will portray
graphically the tremendous changes which have taken
place in human life since man harnessed its power.
The Transportation Section will depict the story of
man's media of travel from the days of the Spanish
ox-cart to the modern auto and airplane.
One feature of the exposition will be
containing materials from the Pacific area. A wealth of
exhibits from Australia, New Zealand, picturesque
islands of the South Seas, and nations of the Orient
will be housed in a special group of buildings. Produc
tions from Japan and epic exhibits of Chinese civili
zation will form another series of attractions. Latin
America will have another portion of the grounds for
displaying its arts and commodities.
Several corporations are constructing buildings to
contain their own private exhibits. Besides, more than
a score of foreign nations are sending special displays:
From Africa, Europe and Asia relics of the past, and
achievements of the present are pouring in daily.
An impressive display of American military
might will take place this summer. One of the
greatest air armadas in the entire history of avia
tion. more than 1,000 planes, will darken the skies
as they Hy in mass formations. The United States
fleet will be there for inspection, and tens of thou
sands of service men. These maneuvers, together
with the United States naval tactics in the Pacific
(bis summer, will be the greatest peace-time
demonstration of America's preparedness ever
held in the Pacific.
San Diego, a city of 175,000 people, expects more
than 50.000 visitors a day to see this extravaganza
of splendor. Besides the concessionnaires, there will be
replicas of various villages throughout the world; a
reproduction of a gulch mining camp of the California
gold rush days of '49; and no end of fiestas and
pageants. The botanical display promises to be one of
the most imposing ever created.
Many contingents of guests from the Orient and
South America are expected, and even scores of tur
baned visitors from far-off India. The exposition will
doubtless call the attention of the world to the growth
of the Pacific commercially, and at the same time
stimulate Pan-Pacific good-will and harmony.

An impressive display of American military
might will take place this summer. One of the
greatest air armadas in the entire history of avia
tion. more than 1,000 planes, will darken the skies
as they Hy in mass formations. The United States
fleet will be there for inspection, and tens of thou
sands of service men. These maneuvers, together
with the United States naval tactics in the Pacific
(bis summer, will be the greatest peace-time
demonstration of America's preparedness ever
held in the Pacific.
San Diego, a city of 175,000 people, expects more
than 50.000 visitors a day to see this extravaganza
of splendor. Besides the concessionnaires, there will be
replicas of various villages throughout the world; a
reproduction of a gulch mining camp of the California
gold rush days of '49; and no end of fiestas and
pageants. The botanical display promises to be one of
the most imposing ever created.
Many contingents of guests from the Orient and
South America are expected, and even scores of tur
baned visitors from far-off India. The exposition will
doubtless call the attention of the world to the growth
of the Pacific commercially, and at the same time
stimulate Pan-Pacific good-will and harmony.
On May 29, 1935, San Diego plans to play host to
the world in the opening of the California Pacific
International Exposition.
The significance of the fact lies in the increasing
importance of the Pacific area in international affairs.
It is rapidly becoming the arena of world trade devel
opments and commercial expansion.
San Diego boasts the title, "A Modern Eden,"
will spend $6,000,000 in preparing the 1400-
acre exposition site on Balboa Park. Congress only
recently passed an appropriation of several hun
dred thousand dollars to further federal buildings
and exhibits, which will be reidy to show this
summer.
Balboa Park is unique in that it is in the heart of
the city, which sprawls out over considerable terri
tory, having a maximum ler*gth of twenty miles and
width of ten miles. The park overlooks San Diego
Bay, into which Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo, the Spanish
explorer, sailed only fifty years after the discovery of
America by Columbus.
The exposition will follow in many respects the
plan of the recent Chicago Century of Pregress Expo
sition, and many countries and firms are moving their
former Chicago features to San Diego, after altering
them in detail.
Myriads of exhibits are contemplated by the
southern city. A Palace of Electricity will portray
graphically the tremendous changes which have taken
place in human life since man harnessed its power.
The Transportation Section will depict the story of
man's media of travel from the days of the Spanish
ox-cart to the modern auto and airplane.
One feature of the exposition will be
containing materials from the Pacific area. A wealth of
exhibits from Australia, New Zealand, picturesque
islands of the South Seas, and nations of the Orient
will be housed in a special group of buildings. Produc
tions from Japan and epic exhibits of Chinese civili
zation will form another series of attractions. Latin
America will have another portion of the grounds for
displaying its arts and commodities.
Several corporations are constructing buildings to
contain their own private exhibits. Besides, more than
a score of foreign nations are sending special displays:
From Africa, Europe and Asia relics of the past, and
achievements of the present are pouring in daily.
