"DAVID COPPERFIELD"
I
At the Stanford Theatre
Even though its running time is
i a mere two hours and twenty mln-
I utes, you'll feel regrets when the
last scene is
flashed on the \
screen, for thus !
is one of the fin- i
est and most en- j
joyable pictures
ever made.
Perhaps a bit 1
too biographical
for the uninitiated, those knowing
Dickens' famous work will revel in
the film's masterful and astonishing
translation to its own medium. It's
an "example of the cinema's ability
to use one masterpiece to create an- !
other."
With unusual attention to techni- !•
cal detail, Director George Cukor i
employs lighting, sets, and excellent
casting to bring vividly to life the j
novel's familiar and immortal char- j
acters: lovable David (PYeddie Bar- j
tholomew, the boy—Frank Lawton, !
the man); staccato Aunt Betsy (Edna
May Oliver); kindly, sponging Mi-I
cawber (W. C. Fields); Dora, the
child wife (Maureen. O'Sullivan); |
tyrannical Mr. Murdstone (Basil |
Rathbone); and villain Uriah Heep !
(Roland Young).
And all the others are there, too, 1
including Steerforth, Agnes, Peg
gotty, Barkis, Dan, and Mr. Wick- ■
field, played by such stars as Lionel 1
Barrymore, Lewis Stone, Madge j
Evans, and Herbert Mundin.
—Brill. I
