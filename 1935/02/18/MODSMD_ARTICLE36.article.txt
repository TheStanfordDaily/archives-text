# CHIPS from the RECORDS...

### 
In tomorrow afternoon's program
of recorded music in room 84 there
are some new and interesting read- |
ings of the compositions of Handel, j
Bach, Schumann and Mozart. Again
the Philadelphia Symphony Orches
tra, under Stokowski, brings the 18th 1
century to new and vivid life with
an arrangement of selections from j
the "Water Music" with which Han- j
del greeted the royal barge on the
River Thames. Six of the classic |
dance numbers are included in this |
most satisfying recording.
Yehudi Menuhin plays the Bach
(Â» minor sonata for unaccompa
nied violin, and most of these two
records showed him at his genial
best. The first movement is, how
ever. surprisingly free from dy
namic changes and makes one re
gret that this young artist treated
this movement with so little of
the nuance and subtlety for which
he is famous.
Two of the greatest overtures in
classic and romantic literature come j
on two discs. The "Manfred Over
ture" by Schumann played by the
British Broadcasting Company or
chestra, and Mozart's "Cosi fan
tutte."
