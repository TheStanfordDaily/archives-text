# BULL SESSION
## "WONDER-WISHING-WELLS" INCORPORATED 
### 
A Great American Artist has yet |
to draw the picture of the Great
American Fi.shbowl—with all of us
swimming around dizzily in con
stantly narrowing concentric circles, j
It could be a gorgeous thing, with
wriggling worms of every size and
color dangling enticingly from the
hooks: there would be the reduc
ing-pill worm, and the real-estate
worm, and the red worm, and the j
black and the brown and the pink
worms. And there in varying stages
of facial and gastronomical delight
fcr disgust, would be the fish—some
nibbling, some gulping, a few snif
fing, many hooked.
Of all things we bite on, by far j
the most simple and ingenious is the 1
: wishing-well. The wishmg-well is j
I nothing more than an old tub of
water —covered with ivy, and deep
| enough to prevent thieves from pul-
I ling out pennies that hopeful souls
; have tossed in. At every resort that
| amounts to anything, there is a
I wishing-well. People throw in their
' pennies, and wish: not because they
believe the wish will come true
(they tell you), but it doesn't hurt
to take a chance . . .
At the end of the year the wish- i
ing-well keeper cleans out the
wishes — the hundreds of penny
j wishes, and even a few big nickle
! wishes. In such fashions do thou
! sands of dollars change hands.
_____
Now if that is the state of the
j public, there is no good reason why
wishing wells should remain a strug

gling little enterprise, rather than ,
falling into the ranks of large scale j
business. I propose to establish a j
chain of wishing-wells, up and
down the coast, east and west, J
known as "Wonder-Wishing-Wells, ;
Incorporated." The corporation will i
not trust to the natural gullibility of j
the people, but in a variety of ways
will massage the tiny sprout of
"sucker" in everyone, into a thing of
immense proportions and profits.
The corporation will steal the !
tired mothers from Lydia Pinkham,
and Mrs. Hannabelle Adams of Pe- j
oria will swear up and down that j
"Wonder-Wishing-Well" No. 88 has ;
brought results. The corporation will j
i steal the movie stars from cigarettes I
i and sofas, and plump them into the j
! wells (a swell place for movie stars). [
J Finally "Wonder - Wishing - Wells"
will purchase divine, pseudo-divine,
and neo-divine blessings, and the |
Age of Profits will recommence, j
People will be afraid to visit a den- j
tist without first having a wish at j
Well No. 45, 73, or 193 (a neighbor
hood service).

This is a corporation, aifd stock is i

the broker, peddling "Wonder- j

the thousands of prospective pen- |
1 nios. Think of the commercialized- j
religionists who have made fortunes
by selling preferred stock in the
Kingdom of Heaven. "Wonder-Wish

1 the Sister Rimees and the Brother j
I Billys a run for their money.

Now if that is the state of the
j public, there is no good reason why
wishing wells should remain a strug

gling little enterprise, rather than ,
falling into the ranks of large scale j
business. I propose to establish a j
chain of wishing-wells, up and
down the coast, east and west, J
known as "Wonder-Wishing-Wells, ;
Incorporated." The corporation will i
not trust to the natural gullibility of j
the people, but in a variety of ways
will massage the tiny sprout of
"sucker" in everyone, into a thing of
immense proportions and profits.
The corporation will steal the !
tired mothers from Lydia Pinkham,
and Mrs. Hannabelle Adams of Pe- j
oria will swear up and down that j
"Wonder-Wishing-Well" No. 88 has ;
brought results. The corporation will j
i steal the movie stars from cigarettes I
i and sofas, and plump them into the j
! wells (a swell place for movie stars). [
J Finally "Wonder - Wishing - Wells"
will purchase divine, pseudo-divine,
and neo-divine blessings, and the |
Age of Profits will recommence, j
People will be afraid to visit a den- j
tist without first having a wish at j
Well No. 45, 73, or 193 (a neighbor
hood service).
