# FROSH HOOPSTERS DOWN ST. MARY'S AND SAN MATEO J.C.
## Galloping Gaels Outpaced By Papooses, 37-25, In Fast Game 
### 
After a two-game slump which j
netted it the only losses of the sea- j
son, Stanford's frosh basketball |
team burst into the scoring col- j
umns again this week-end, took j
their two tilts handily from St. |
Mary's 37-25 and San Mateo J. C. j
43-22.
It was a fast eager Stanford fresh- j
man squad that administered St. i
Mary's first beating of the season I
Friday night, and although some oi {
the "spurt" that characterized their j
early season play was gone, the |
Cards showed that they could come j
back.
Hank Luisetti once *gain struck
his scoring stride, chalking up 1!)
points in each of the games to
carry Stanford high scoring hon
ors. Dick Lyon seconded Luiselli
with !( points tallied Friday and
II) scored the following evening.
Against St. Mary's the frosh spent j
an uneasy first half. Both teams were j
playing tight ball, and both were j
making their shots good. At hall |
time the Indians carried a one
point lead, 13-12.
The first 13 minutes of the second
half was nearly an even-up battle, i
Stanford managed to hang on to its j
scant lead, principally through the |
efforts of Luisetti, Lyon and the di- 1
minutive guard, H. B. Lee. For- j
wards Clarence Maurer, Dick Bigler .
and Bill Hulburt were unable to hit ;
the pace; Bradshaw juggled them in j
and out of the game during the last !
period. \
In the final minutes the Gaels ,
eased oil, Stanford ran the score j
from 29-25 to 37-25 at the gun.
Saturday night Stanford re
versed the procedure of the eve- j
ning before, started the scoring j
early in the game and let up !
slightly as the end nearcd. San
Mateo .I.C. was ph.yinj> fast ball
but failed to slip into scoring ter- j
ritory as Stanford ran up a 23-(>
lead at the half. Then the Bull- :
dogs started dropping in baskets j
from all angles, matching each !
Stanford basket with one for j
themselves to trail 22-43 as the last :
li -, lf ended.
Dick Bigler, substitute forward
who has seen little action this sea
son, played most of the San Mateo
game, scored four points, and gave
indication lhat with more experience
on the floor he could become one of
Stanford's most clever ball hand
lers. Don Dewar, rangy substitute
guard, also turned in a good
showing.
