# SENATOR GLASS READY TO FIGHT DESPITE HEALTH
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 17 (/P)
—Quito a few administration
leaders today were looking for
ward with concern—if not dread
—to the day that Senator Car
ter Glass of Virginia says what
he thinks about the adminis
tration's banking bill.
Glass has been silent about
that measure thus far and that
silence, from the administra
tion's viewpoint, K ominous.
There were a few perhaps
who thought that fMass was too
old—he is 77—to put up a real
ly rousing scrap. A couple of
years ago his health was so bad
that his friends were alarmed.
But indignation ovei some ad
ministration proposals appar
ently have done him more good
than the doctors.
Those who thought Senator
Glass's age would prevent him
from activity this session
changed their minds after they
watched him go after the $4,-
880.000,000 work relief bill.
