# Cardinals Trim Trojans in Rugger, 23-9
## Farm's Hopes Or Conference Pennant Soar Lewis Tallies 14 of 23 Cardinal Points 
### Warren Breed 
i Crushing the Trojan with a first \
j half offensive in Los Angeles, Card j
' ruggers Saturday established them- !
i selves as best bet for the California j
i championship.
The redskin fifteen was too fast !
and clever for the bulky S.C. scrum. ]
The final score, 23 to 9, was held j
down because the Southern Gali- I
fornia sun shone with scorching j
brilliance during the first half, and |
the second was considerably .slowed i
down.
Lewis Stars
Again Ray Lewis, the Stanford }
field goal artist, rang up high score. j
He crossed the line for a try, com- |
pleted a penalty kick, and converted i
each of the four tries, for a total of |
14 points.
Johnny Reisner at wing, Frank i
Alustiza as second five-eighths, and j
Jerry Peters in the front rank were j
responsible for the other three tries, i
It was a case of better rugby win- j
ning. S.C.'s lineup included as many, j
if not more, football stars than that
of the Cards, but the coaching of
Jim Wylie and Harry Maloney, plus I
experience, won for the Cards.
Team Going Strong
Both the scrum and the backs j
showed to advantage. Also encour
aging about the victory is that the |
Indians will not be weakened to any j
great extent for the next two con- .
ference games, with U.C.L.A. and |
U.C.B.
Stanford's main threat to the j
lough time beating the S.F. Blues
championship, Cal's Bears, had a
Saturday. The Card varsity breezed j
through the same team, and even 1
the B team beat them not long ago.
The team returned late last night I
and this morning from the south- [
land. It was accompanied by two !
coaches, Trainer Lefty Osell and
Manager Chuck Ducommun.
