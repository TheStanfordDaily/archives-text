## 
### JOHN MeCLELLAND 
Stubbornly defying the expecta
tion of a complete rout at the hands
of Southern California, Stanford
swimmers last Friday came within
one point of tying the mighty Tro
jans, called the greatest swim team
in the country. The score was 41-42.
Not until the very last event had
been run ofi did the Trojans have
victory at hand. In fact the Cards led
right up to that last event, the med
ley relay, and if they had won would
have pulled the biggest surprise oi
the aquatic season.
Cards Win Two Events
Seven well-won first places ac
counted for all of S.C.'s points, while
Stanford ran up her total with two
first places and 13 second and third
places. Bob Foster came through in
the breast-stroke, and Tom Boothe
took the diving without opposition.
In Winnirig the 200-yard breast
stroke, Captain Foster not only de
feated one of the Trojans' best men,
but also clipped nearly two seconds
from the Pacific Coast intercolle
giate mark and won himself the un
official title of coast champion.
Foster, Pacific Association cham
pion, swam against Jack Paulsen,
who is the southern Pacific cham
pion, and defeated him decisively.
Foster covered his distance in 2:35.4
seconds, breaking the formcu- mark
of 2:37.1 seconds.
Gilhula Spectacular
Jimmy Gilhula, Troy's world's
record holder in four events, turned
in the most spectacular perform
ance of the day and set two new
I marks. In the 440-yard free style,

which he won by a full length and
a half of the tank, the S.C. ace set a
coast record of 4:51.4, bettering the
former mark set by Ted Wiget of
Stanford by a full half minute. And
j!i the 220-yard free style Gilhula
clipped two and a half seconds from
the old mark with a time of 2:10.5
seconds.
John Kaye erased another Stan
ford mark when he bested the old
record of Frank Loupe in the 150-
yard backstroke with 1:44.5 seconds.
Defeat San Jose 55-27
Saturday night the Indians de
feated San Jose in the Spartans' pool
by a 55-27 score. Scoring for Stan
lord were Foster, who swam within
a half-second of the coast record in
the 100-yard breaststroke to win in
1 minute 10.4 seconds; Jack Berg
man won the 300-yard medley, with
I Foster second; Bob Hoover won the
220-yard and Bill Clemo the 440-
, yard free style events; and the med
ley relay team of Bob Ettienne,
John Harvey, and Kuhn took first
when the latter made up five yards
in the final lap.
