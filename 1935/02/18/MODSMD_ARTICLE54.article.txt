# LYNCH WINS OVER MAKO IN BRILLIANT TENNIS EXHIBITION
## Card Tenins Men Defeat Berkeley Club; Lee, Seward Beaten 
### 
Stanford's galavanting tennis j
' players have been busier than a ;
j naval officer explaining the value of
| dirigibles this last week, what with
1 staying up past their bedtime play
| ing in the Northern California In
door Tournament, and playing prac
tice matches in the afternoon.
Biggest sensation in the tennis j
world for many a moon was little i
Jack Lynch's sensational defeat of I
U.S.C.'s famous Gene Mako at the
Palace of Fine Arts Tournament ;
Thursday night.
Lynch Is Sensation
Lynch says Mako was off form, i
while Bob Pommer, number six
man on the varsity, claims that
Lynch was "hot." It is certain that
steel-nerved Lynch outsteadied
! Mako in the third set to win 4-6, i
| 6-4, 6-4.
It is also certain that to take Mako !
! at any time requires a good deal of |
j tennis playing. John Murio defeated I
Bill Seward on Friday night, and !
Jack Lynch on Friday night to elimi- i
! nate the last remaining Stanford i
j men in the tournament.
I Sam Lee, with a wi'ecked leg ten
j don. and John Law, with a wrenched
1 back, defaulted their quarter-final
| doubles match against Gerry Hyde
I and Howard Blethen.
Traveling to Berkeley Saturday
| afternoon minus the services of
j Lynch in singles, who was resting 1
in preparation for his impending
| match with Murio that night, and
! plus the services of Law and Lee,
j the varsity defeated the Berkeley
I Tennis Club five matches to four. ;
Heat Lee, Seward
Despite the fact that the Berkeley
ites were minus the services of sev
eral of their stars who were playing
in the city, they had Bud Chandler, ;
former state champ, and Carl Homes,
former California captain, who suc
ceeded in taking Lee and Seward,
respectively.
Stanford's wins came when John
Law defeated Hornsberger, Bob
Pommer defeated Herschel Hyde, |
j Dan Clark defeated Barney de Viere, j
j and the second and third doubles j
teams of Seward and Day, Lynch
and Pommer defeated Holmes and
Chuck Weesner, and Hyde and Dan
Roberts.
Ben Day lost to Roberts, and Lee I
and Law lost to Chandler and Hons- j
berger in first doubles.
