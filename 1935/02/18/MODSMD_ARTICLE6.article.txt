# HOOVER PRINTS HISTORY NOTES
## Period 1929-33, Treated In Two Volumes 
### 
From the pen of Herbert C.
Hoover, No. 1 Stanford alumnus,
comes a brace of volumes totaling
1,235 pages, containing his state pa
pers and other public writings from
March 4, 1929, to March 4, 1933.
This contribution to the documen
tary sources of the period in ques
tion was issued under the editorial
direction of Dr. William Starr
Myers, professor of politics, Prince
ton University, and copies of the
works have just been received by
the Stanford University library.
The first document given is for
mer President's inaugural address
of 1929. Hi.s proclamations, executive
orders, innumerable press confer
ence statements, letters to senators,
representatives and other individ
uals, campaign speeches of 1932 and
addresses on various occasions com
prise the bulk of the two volumes.
The progressive note of urgency
sounded in his writings as the na
lion went deeper and deeper into the
depression during 1930, 1931 and
1932 is at once striking to the read
er, and shows how closely Mr.
Hoover followed every symptom of
America's economic malady.
Anyone .reading the volumes will
find a compendium of vital informa
tion on every phase of the critical
years, 1929-1933, on finance, foreign
relations, and federal administrative
problems seen through presidential
eyes.
