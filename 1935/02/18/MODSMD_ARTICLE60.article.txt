# DECISION ON GOLD CLAUSE AWAITED BY NATION TODAY
## Supreme Court Exacted To Make Ruling On New Deal Case 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 17 (/P) —
Every man's money was gripped to
night in a Supreme Court decision j
— expected tomorrow — reaching to !
the very' heart of the New Deal
monetary program.
The court will rule, the capital j
felt, on the gold cases within a few
hours. If so, it will say, specifically,,
whether Congress had authority tfor
outlawing all promises to pay in
gold.
All Purses Hit
But, in a broader sense, its opin- !
ion will determine whether the fun- j
damental changes worked in the.
currency system by President Roose
velt are to' stand, or whether a new |
and stirring series of monetary de
velopments is to begin.
Every pocketbook in the nation is
affected.
M-\y Delay Again
The capital and a nervous busi- j
ness world have awaited the verdict '
eagerly for weeks. Several times,
they have worked themselves into a j
high pitch of suspense and tension
upon the expectation it would be
announced on a particular date.
Each time, however, the court,' I
outwardly oblivious of the sur- ;
rounding excitement, has placidly
and inscrutably attended to other
business. That might happen again
tomorrow, but Washington ha rea
son to believe it will not be disap
pointed this time.
