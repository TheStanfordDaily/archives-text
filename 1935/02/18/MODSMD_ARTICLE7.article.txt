## 
### 
A letter from Buford Williams, I
Oklahoma oil man and Stanford '
alumnus, yesterday cleared up the !
charge of proselyting in Oklahoma 1
recently made against Ditik Temple- I
ton, Card track mentor.
John Jacobs, Oklahoma track
coach, publicly denounced Temple
ton for attempting to obtain Orville
Mathews, Chickasha, Oklahoma,
sprinter, for future Indian track
teams, and Williams cleared up the
matter as follows:
"Dink Templeton did not know
the boy, did not meet the boy, did
not directly or indirectly get any
word through to the boy, and was j
not even told the boy was coming
. . . I myself, and I alone, have scout
ed Orville's work, and of my own
volition and own accord have made
up my mind that I want to see him
at Stanford."
