# DIGEST MAKES FINAL REPORTS ON PEACE POLL
## 1,270 Farm Students Vote; Majority Would Fight If U.S. Invaded 
### 
Of all the 318,414 College Peace ;
Poll ballots sent out by the Literary
Digest to the students of the major- |
ity of American universities, and i
Queen's University in Kingston, On
tario, more than a third have been j
returned, according to the final ye- I
port. Out of this total Stanford stu- 11
dents sent in about 1,270 ballots.
Fifty-one per cent of the colleges
voted against entry into the League 1
of Nations. The balloting for the con- j
trol of munitions by the United j
States was 9-1 in favor of the move, |
while the voting in regard to the J
universal conscription of capital and
labor to control profits in time of j
war was stol in the affirmative. j
Oppose Naval Force
Other questions open to the stu- j
dent poll were whether the United \
States could stay out of another war,
which 76,441 students believed pos- j
sible; whether the United States j
should have a navy and air force j
second to none was overwhelmingly j
opposed; and the question "would
you bear arms for the United States j
if your country was invaded," or j
"'would you bear arms in the inva- j
I sion of another country" was an- t
swered, in the former case, affirma- ;
tively, and in the latter, negatively, j
In regard to these questions, Stan- j
! ford students voted 797 to 476 that j
| the United Slates could remain out
I of another war. Of those who voted j
j 983 stated that they would fight for
their country if the borders were in- j
j vaded, but only 207 of the 1,256 1
I would fight if the United States wera |
J the invader.
Farm Favors League
The Farm vote with regard to I
I whether there should be federal \
| control of munitions was 1,187 to 90
in the affirmative, while the univer- ;
| sal conscription question was an-i
i swered by a vote of 1,046 yes, and
217 no. The balloting of the League
of Nations problem was relatively j
close, in that 708 favored affirma- ;
tively and 547 negatively; 923 stu
dents claimed that the building of j
a "navy and air force second ,
to none" would insure us against
another war, while only 346 be
lieved that this would not settle the I
problem.
