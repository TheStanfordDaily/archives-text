# SECOND LAMSON JURY REVIEWED
## Battle of Scientists Seen For Murder Re-Trial 
### 
SAN JOSE. Calif., Feb. 18 (/P) â€” J
A parade of prospective jurors j
passed through court for legal re- j
view today as David A. Lamson j
went to trial a second time on J
charges that he murdered his at- |
tractive young wife with blows from !
an iron pipe.
There were indications another j
day or two might be necessary to
select a jury to try the former Stan
ford University Press sales mana- j
ger, whose first conviction and death j
were set aside by the State Supreme j
Court.
Thirty-six jurors were excused j
for cause at the morning session as j
prosecution and defense maneu- I
vered. During the afternoon the jury
box was temporarily filled with six |
men and six women.
The state charges stains on the j
pipe are blood which flowed from j
the young wife's head as she was
struck, allegedly by Lamson. Refu
sal of the trial court to permit eer- j
tain evidence tending to support the j
accident theory was one of the j
grounds on which a reversal of con- j
viction was granted by the State !
Supreme Court.
With selection of the jury, state i
and defense are expected to produce i
a battle of scientists over stains on !
the iron pipe, raked from ashes of a
backyard rubbish fire Lamson was I
attending shortly before his wife's !
body was discovered.
