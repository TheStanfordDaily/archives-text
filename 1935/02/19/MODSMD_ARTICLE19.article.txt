# CARDINALS END READING DRIVE FOR C.C.C. MEN
## Final Campus Canvass For Books, Magazines To Be Made Today 
### 
Culminating a week's drive for |
books and magazines for the Civi- j
lian Conservation Corps of Califor- i
nia, the Cardinals will today can- j
! vass the halls and the Row for con- j
| tributions.
Since today is the last day of the '
i drive, last minute contributors are j
1 asked by Will Eisner to cooperate |
! by giving any i-eadable material io j
I Cardinal representatives. Students j
i may also leave any donations in a j
1 box at the loan desk of the library. !
j Although any reading matter is '
I acceptable, that suitable for people '
between the ages of 18 and 20 years
is preferable.
The drive has more and more j
] taken on the aspect of a clean-up |
| drive, giving advantages to both do
| nators and receivers. Many maga- j
| zines have found their way from j
I corners and shelves, where they j
i were once discarded, to the hands i
! of the Cardinals.
