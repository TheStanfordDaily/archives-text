# Dr. Leighton Will Talk On Ultra Violet Radiation
## 
### 
Demonstrating fluorescence and
the ability of minerals to retain
phosphorescence after the violet ray
is removed, Dr. Philip A. Leighton,
associate professor of chemistry, will
speak before the Science Association
at 8 o'clock Wednesday evening in
the Faculty Men's Clubhouse. His
subject is "Experiments with Ultra
Violet Radiation."
Dr. Leighton will show a number
of ordinary appearing rocks con
taining minerals which show up wilh
greater brilliancy when the violet
ray is turned on them. A picture
painted by Dr. Leighton in phos
phorescent paints also displays the
fluorescent effect of the ray.
