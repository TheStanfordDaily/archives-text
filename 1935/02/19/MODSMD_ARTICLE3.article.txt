# Traffic Violations Rise with Coming Of Spring Fever
## 
### 
Traditional effects of spring
weather are love, dreams, sleep,
and cut classes, but to Gordon
Davis, campus cop, the most
significant consequence of the
buzzing of bees and the sprout
ing of grass is an increase in
traffic violations.
It's only, February, but
Gordie is already showing the
effects of added labor. "I ex
pect to issue 25 per cent more
tags during the next four
months than are issued during
all the rest of the school year,"
he declared today. "As soon as
the weather gets warm, people
just dream when they come to
stop signs and 20-mile zones."
It isn't the romantic couples
in cars, however, who get the
greatest number of "dings"
from Stanford's motorized nem
esis. Much more often. Officer
Davis has found, it's the gang
of roughs or co. ds who get into
traffic trouble.
Yesterday at Men's Council
meeting there appeared some
dozen or more sorrowful speed
violators â€” victims of Officer
Gordv's annual .spring drive.
