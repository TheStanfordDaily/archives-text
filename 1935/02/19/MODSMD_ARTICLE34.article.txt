# The 						Cold Clause And Its Possible Effects

### 
Although the nation at large breathed a
great of relief yesterday when the Su
preme Court handed down in the morning a
1 decision which swept away any govern
ment or private obligation to pay gold bonds
in gold, the Stanford student received the
decision as merely another news story of
headlines and pictures and as a topic for econ
majors to bandy in bull sessions.
The rough found that the wrinkled dirty
dollar bill in his wallet could still buy 100
cents worth of goods, just as it had done over
Ihe week-end. If he happened to own some
stocks, he smiled at the dollar profits he
could write down on paper as a result of the
Wall Street reception of the news; perhaps
he figured on an additional trip to the (lily
on those profits.
To the country the decision meant the stav
ing oil' of approximately 140 billion dollars
in additional debts, both private and govern
mental. Hut the importance of the decision
was highly exaggerated, for the President
stood ready to rush bills through Congress
had the court ruling been unfavorable to the
Administration's previous legislation on the
monetary question.
The efleet of the decision was to validate
the act of Congress suspending gold payments
of private obligations containing gold clauses,
which was passed on June ">, 1933. The court
ruled that the holders of gold certificates had
no legal cause for complaint, since the de
valuation act merely carried out the power
of Congress to regulate the currency. The de
cision, however, staled that the government
had no right to break its promise to pay bonds
in the old dollar, but the court in legal termi
nology told the holder of the government bond
"to try to get it." Because of a prohibition
placed on the court of claims denying the
light of that court to handle such cases, the
ruling closed the door to recovery of damages
by saying that bondholders could not sue for
redress. The court also made the holder of
gold certificates subject to prosecution.
In such a manner has the momentous gold
decision been handed down.
The Stanford rough will stay in college, the
New Deal will record another triumph, the
bogy of money disasters will be temporarily
stilled, and business will continue as usual â€”
perhaps with a little added spurt.
