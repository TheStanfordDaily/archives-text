Women suflrage loaders who saw thoir
cause triumph in 19*20 should gleefully rub
their hands over the lads concerning the bal
loting in the A.S.S.I . election of last Tuesday
when the Stanford maid displayed a superior
voting intelligence over the rough.
One out of every ten ballots east for the
men's council was discarded and declared
void by the election committee because it
was marked incorrectly because the rough
failed to follow the instructions plainly
printed at the top of the ballot. In the vote
for the women's council, only one out of
every 1(1 ballots was ruled invalid.
Reasons for voiding the ballots: use of a
chock instead of an "x," other marks besides

an "x" (figures for choices), markings in
pencil instead of ink, markings in pencil
over ink, and markings in pencil and ink.
Some ballots were even placed in the election
boxes without any markings at all mere
blank ballots.
So tared last Tuesday's A.S.S.I'. election.
In other words, it was the same old ease of
students not reading the plainly marked in
structions ;it the lop of every ballot, which
warned: "ballots must be marked in ink" and
"any mark or marks on any part or parts of
this ballot except the intended 'x' or the at
tachment of any write-in slip, makes the
whole ballot void."
It was the same old story that has been
the moaning cry of students in linals: "We
did not see the instructions."
The discarding of S7 ballots in the Men's
Council voting, as compared with the wom
en's 11, was an indictment against the care
lessness of the Stanford rough and an en
dorsement of the more careful Stanford maid.
