# Away with Huey!
## 
### 
A new solution of the rather unsavory prob
lem of Huey Long in Louisiana was sug
: gested by Mr. Bangs, our Eastern correspond
cut, in a recent "Viewing the News." I'mler
I the provisions of the Constitution; says the
i columnist, Mr. Iloosevelt is empowered to step
in, take out the present rotten core, and guar
! antec a wholesome, republican government to
, that benighted state.
Now Huey is making fools of both himself
i and the people of Louisiana. The nation has
become too used to laughing at the pompous
Kingtish even to take him seriously. Thinking
! citizens, however, have come to realize that
there is a real danger to the United States
from Huev's hooey.
Publicity stunts such as a reported "assas
| sination," far-Hung loudspeaker campaigns
lor Long stooges in other states, and resound
ing speeches in Congress which mean nothing
but make copy for newspapers, all go to show
that the Senate's No. I tall talker is inveigling
| himself into the public eye in no mean man
j ner.
Meanwhile the graft, corruption, and gang
1 rule continue in the sleepy state of Louisiana.
Voters are bulldozed, henchmen are put on the
payroll by the hundreds, and the state goes
to pot while the rest of the country quietly
looks on.
The generally admitted story that the last
; Republican administration "had the goods"
on Huey in great enough degree to get rid of
him (had they had time) shows that there
must exist somewhere a sufficient handle by
which the Kingfish might be lifted bodily
, Irom his leather hed and deposited in a con
; venient booby hatch.
