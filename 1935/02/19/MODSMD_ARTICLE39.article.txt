Two dark clad, heavily padded young men standing
as if nailed to the floor in a black, dismal hall, doors
heavily barred, hacking at each other's bare faces with
sharp-lipped swords before a dozen or 30 grim-visaged
| onlookers — and — twenty-two helmeted young men
i plunging and runing frantically on a bright, sun-lit
| stretch of greensward before the eyes of 50.000 stadium
squatters.
The former action more dangerous than the latter?
I Yes, thinks Dr. Herbert Mueller, German exchange
I student at the University of Kansas.
Dueling, the ancient Deutchland University sport,
I was revived by Herr Hitler in 1933—revived in the
j .sense that it was brought out in the open; it never
actually died. Dr. Mueller proudly wears the trophies
of eight student duels on his face, scars which came as a
I result of membership in Rhenania, an organization
! comparable to an American fraternity. IHe is one who
I has stood in those dismal halls, his eyes protected by
guards, but his face bare, and given and taken ma
licious but carefully watched .swipes with razor-edged
swords. And Mueller has seen American fool ball games,
i "I'd rather duel," chooses he.
Dueling boasts a far more pretentious beginning
than the grid game, having its origin in the time of
Napoleon when German students organized an armed
unit called the Burschenschaften, which played a pow
j erful part in the defeat of the French tyrant in the
j war of 1913.
From the early part of the nineteenth century
I dueling among the university students became as im
| portant a phase of their lives as beer drinking. Then
1 came the revolution of 1918 when this manly custom
I of carving one another was forbidden by the govern
! ment and mass consumption of dark lager beer became
| sport number one. Secret combats were held during the
next 15 years and when fighters were caught and con
victed of a "crime," the offenders were given an "honor"
] imprisonment behind the - grim walls of a nearby
j castle.
The belief that organized cheek-slashing built
"character, resoluteness, confidence, poise, pride and
| courage," led Dec! Duehrer to sanction dueling two
years ago and now it flourishes unhampered by the
1 law.
Kansas Student Mueller describes the ordinary
duel:
"A sporting proposition which is virtually an intra
mural activity. Each of the two contestants has a judge,
! a second, a physician and a marker who records each
successful thrust. Each candidate and bus second are
! protected by body padding, only the faces are exposed
to the opponent's blade.
"Tlie two men take positions opposite each other,
toeing a mark. They begin at the judge's signal, thrust
ing the sword from a position above the shoulder. Each
1 scoring slash is counted aloud by the judge. After three
1 tallies, the counting judge commands, "Stop!" and the
i two seconds step between the combatants. After a
moment, the duelists continue.
"If a foul is committed, the second of the man fouled
cries "Foul!" and puts his sword between the fighters.
If the second stops the fight three times, the other sec
: ond challenges him and there is another duel. Tht.se
I combats are weekly affairs."
