HAMBURGER STILL HIGH
The Editor, Sir:
Our retiring Daily chief, Mr.
Beaubaire, should be congratulated
on his successful campaign to bring
about "drastic reductions" in the
prices of delicacies at the Union Cel
lar. But, unfortunately, Mr. Beau
baire did not go far enough with
his efforts; he gave no thought to
the prices on '"Rough's Food," which
still remain fabulously high. For in
stance, at the non-profit Cellar one
bowl of soup costs the rough 16
cents; a fried egg sandwich, 21 cents;
a ground steak (hamburger) sand
wich, 16 cents.
I know, Mr. Editor, you would
have the support of some hundreds
of roughs (who realize two-bit
pieces don't grow on trees as some
of the Cellarites would have you be
lieve) if you could do anything to
bring about a remedy for this very
abnormal situation.
Hugh R. Mellon, '36.
