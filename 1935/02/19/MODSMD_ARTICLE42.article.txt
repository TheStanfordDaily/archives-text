# HELP SAVE MENLO
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
It seems incredible that Menlo
Park would have surrendered, for
liquor revenue, its potential destiny.
This town is unique in traditional
wealth pertaining to Stanford Uni
versity. It was at this Southern Pa
cific terminus that David Starr Jor
dan arrived to organize this great in
stitution of learning.
Here is a territory of scenic beauty
paralleling the Stanford farm from
El Camino Real to the Santa Cruz
Mountains. No other location adja
cent to Stanford and the railroad
has such delightful natural land
scape reaching up into the hills. Re
cent development in Stanford Park,
which was stimulated by the Al
lied Arts center, is jeopardized by
the pending "Gilmore Bill."
According to a recent compila
tion, last year's grog shop license
fees for Menlo Park approximated
$1100. This, the wets affirm, is
"needed" for the support of the
town. Would this meager sum pay
the salary of one town employe?
Surely the remarkable growth and
prosperity of Palo Alto, a "dry"
town, over the two older "wet"
towns, Mayfield and Menlo Park,
all lying near the campus, refutes
the claim of the liquor interests that
licensed intoxicants is a business
asset.
Can the citizens of this community
remain neutral in this vital issue?
Alcoholic beverage is a detriment to
wholesome life and to stable indus
try as evinced by increased demor
alization and the decline in con
sumption of healthful milk drinks
â€¢since repeal of the Eighteenth
Amendment. Recent surveys made
by Dr. John Haynes Holmes and Dr.
Alonzo Baker disclose this signifi
cant information. Consequently, an
obligation confronts each citizen to
voice a definite attitude in the pres
ent controversy to the end that the
youth may have a more favorable
environment in which to develop.
