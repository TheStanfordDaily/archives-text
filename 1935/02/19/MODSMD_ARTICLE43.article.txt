# BULL SESSION
## CALLING 3121 
### 
Stanford dormitories have what
is known as a "telephone system."'
Every time the term is used, the
spirit of Noah Webster cries out at
' the misuse of the English language.
And the great bearded soul of Alex
ander Graham Bell shudders as it
I reflects on the depths to which "the
j telephone" has fallen.
The system is hom«ey-folksey all
! right. When things are dull, you can
j always have a little chit-chat with
the operator. And the operator can
j tell you whether or not the little
| lady is two-timing you. But if you
j are so depi aved a.s to want to use
J the "telephone system" for tele
phoning, you have missed entirely
j the concept of a Stanford "telephone
I system."
The telephone system was in
j stalled when Stanford was a man's
| school, when there were some wom
'en here, but nobody was proud ot
the fact. It is too much to say thftt
in those days the telephone system
i was efficient, but at least it was
' fairly adequate.
Then came the deluge, and the
j Farm was flooded with silks and sat
ins, powder and perfume, and all
; the rest. Stanford men rose to the
J occasion. Not so, the telephone- sys

i tern. With but few changes, the
switchboard, through which the "old
rough" had made his dates with tht
"old Stanford woman," was expected
to do the work for the new era in
; Stanford dating. But the old switch- i
board couldn't take the new women. 1
They broke him. Today he stands,
a beaten switchboard.
Present facilities simply do not
i take care of the rush of calls, par
ticularly from seven to nine o'clock
in the evening. Hall men have been
known to fall asleep standing up in
the phone booth, waiting for the
j operator to answer. The rush-hour
I operators — abused and harassed —
try sometimes to speed things up.
But the old switchboard simply does
not make the grade.
Men of Sequoia, of course, are
used to terrible service. You don't
("call" a man at Sequoia, you "holler"
ihiin. The rooms are devoid of any
thing remotely related to the newer
inventions.
When the financial storm clouds
J lift, or when the Union Dollar comes
home to roost—Stanford men and
i women expect the phone service to
jbe improved. In the meanwhile,
' write your senator.

Stanford dormitories have what
is known as a "telephone system."'
Every time the term is used, the
spirit of Noah Webster cries out at
' the misuse of the English language.
And the great bearded soul of Alex

j always have a little chit-chat with
the operator. And the operator can
j tell you whether or not the little

j are so depi aved a.s to want to use
J the "telephone system" for tele
phoning, you have missed entirely
j the concept of a Stanford "telephone
I system."
The telephone system was in
j stalled when Stanford was a man's
