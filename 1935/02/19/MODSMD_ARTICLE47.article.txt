Concerned with the realization by
a wealthy play-girl that her life has
been worthless and wasted, this
drama unfortunately falls flat. Up ij
the last act wo can sympathize with
the trials and troubles of Tony Lyle,
but when she goes into a "decline"
after the second curtain it is too
much. We can only be relieved when
she succumbs to the inevitable and
dies.
On the other hand, of s;pecial in
terest to the Stanford campus is the
fine work of Shelley Smi.th, in the

comedy role of Constance Peyton,
and the excellent staging and di
recting by Harold Helveston. The
latter's first set, a lounge conserva
tory, is especially good. Marion
Burns, in the role of Tony Lyle, de
serves praise, as does Ray Clifford
as Gehring Filler.
—B. Sweet.
