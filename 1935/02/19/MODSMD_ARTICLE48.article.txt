## "IT'S A MIRACLE" "OF ALL THINGS" 
### 
Nothing could more forcefully dis
play the great psychological handi
cap that weighs on Cardinal basket
ball than the metropolitan accounts
of the long-awaited victory over
California last Saturday night.
"It's a miracle, t basketball men
will insist . . . Stanford took the
lead, and of all things, held it . . ."
and "The unexpected happensâ€”even
in basketball" must have seemed a
fiat reward for Coach John Bunn
and the determined squad that have
been working since last October for
that very triumph. When the re
sponse to a defeat is ' The usual hap
pened" and all a win can call forth
is "It's a miracle," there is really not
a great deal of incentive for playing
the game at all.
