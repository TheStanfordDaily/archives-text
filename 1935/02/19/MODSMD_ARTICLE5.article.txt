# Kahn to Ask Committee For Social Code Tonight
## Unifying of Regulations On A.S.S.U. Docket 
### 
Stanford's uninhibited brethren
! will have to be uninhibited under
I the same sort of rules, if A.S.S.U.
j President Marvie Kahn secures the
! adoption of more uniform social
! regulations by Ex Committee.
A beginning on the codification
of social regulations, which, Kahn
points out, are in a disorganized
state at present, will probably be
i made by Ex Committee tonight
with the appointment of a com
| mittee to organize social rcgula
| lions'.
j "This is not going lo be an investi-
I gation," says Kahn. The movement
| for more uniform i"egulations, par
ticularly among men's living groups,
; is designed to prevent future ex-
I cesses under Stanford's "double
j standard."
Initiation Scheduled
i The Ex Committee fledglings:
' Sterling Cottrell, Frank Fullen
! wider, and Adrienne Johnston, who
I were made guardians of the public
j welfare in last week's elections, will
i get their first chance tonight to carry
| out the promises they made at Bill
! Rogers' political rally.
President Kahn will welcome the
j newcomers with words of wisdom,
j telling them what is expected of
| them during their term of office.
May Alter By-Laws
i Fullenwider, as the first official
act in the Fullenwider New Deal,
j will present to Ex Committee a plan
! for fixing up the forgotten by-laws
i by a complete renovation of these
I misbegotten articles.
A question brought up at the last
meeting of Bill Leslie's right to a
I circle "S" for running in the cross
| country was substantiated by a let -
I ter from California's .Ciaduate Man
ager Bill Monahan, which revealed
that Leslie did not place high enough
j in the race to get his award.
I The recount of the Men's Council
j election showed the same results
I (hat were announced last week. Leo
] Cook with 319 votes and Wadsworth
I White with 309 will be considered
i officially elected, if Ex Committee
| accepts the recount tonight.
