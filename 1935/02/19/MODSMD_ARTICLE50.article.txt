Saturday's upset further empha
sized that basketball contests can
not ba predicted. The odds were
even longer against the Cards than
they had been all season.
During the previous week-end
Stanford had dropped two rather
desultory contests to the Trojans,
while the Bears had come back with
a vengeance in the .second U.C.L.A.
Eame to win overwhelmingly. In
the three practice sessions before
the game, the Cards were not only
"cold" but apparently disliked noth
ing more than the game of basket
ball.
