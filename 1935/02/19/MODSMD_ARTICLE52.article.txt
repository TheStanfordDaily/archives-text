# Boxing Captain Breaks Thumb, Out for Season
## 
### 
Sims Do Veuve, varsity boxing i
captain, broke his thumb in spar
ling practice yesterday, and will be |
out for the remainder of the season, |
it was believed last night.
Because of the injury, DeVeuve j
will not make the trip to Los Ange
les with the team Wednesday to
meet U.C.L.A. He had been counted 1
on for action in either the middle
weight or light heavyweight class, j
and was considered a sure winner j
in which ever bout he selected.
DeVeuve won the all-University
light heavy crown, and floored his
middleweight opponent in the Cali- |
iornia match last week in the first \
round.
