With Bones Hamilton stealing
home with the winning run, the
Stanford varsity baseball team de
feated the U.S.S. Arizona nine by a
score of 5-4 yesterday afternoon on
the sunken diamond.

see the Stanford infield settle down,
with but five errors being made
against 12 in the game last Saturday.
I A1 Semmelroth pitched the first five
j innings for the Cards, allowing but
eight hits, while Johnny Campbell
finished, being nicked for but one
hit and gaining credit victory.
Gordon Malatratt and Ted Leidig
led the Indian batters, with two hits
apiece.
