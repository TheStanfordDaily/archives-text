### Gordy Frost 
At 4 o'clock this afternoon in the
pavilion the current campus argu
j ment as to which is better —Stanford
. frosh or Stanford varsity—will be
I settled when the two teams meet in
! the second of their annual games
1 to be played this season*
Early in November Coach John
i Bunn's varsity took a 28-20 win
, from the lrosh. Since that time both
' teams have seen much play and
j have improved accordingly.
Varsity Has "Punch"
The varsity, although holding the
I cellar -position in their league,
| showed that they have the "punch"
I needed for victory when they de
| feated California last week-end.
The frosh, losers of but two games
this season, are ranked as one of the
best yearling quintets produced at
Stanford in several years. Last
week-end they gave St. Mary's their
first defeat this season, also tripped
San Mateo J. C.
j Bunn's winning lineup of Satur
i day night will include Keith Top
| ping, center; "Dinty" Moore and
I Robin Lindsey, guards; Rod Best
| and Arne Anderson, forwards.
Howell Turner may start for An-
J derson, the Cardinal coach ex
plained last night.
Bradshaw Shifts Line-up
Frosh mentor Jimmy Bradshaw
will, with one exception, send his
I regular first string into the fray,
with Dick Lyon at center, Nelly
! Heath and H. B. Lee, guards and
1 Dick Bigler and Hank Luisetti, for
wards. At the other forward post
j Bradshaw plans to use Bigler, who
j came to the front playing his initial
| first string game against San Mateo
| Saturday.
i Bradshaw last night was com
! municating with California frosh on
the possibilities of arranging a third
meeting between the two teams
since each has won a game this
season.
