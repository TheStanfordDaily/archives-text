LONDON, Feb. 18 (/P)—Three re
lief committees with headquarters
in Geneva and Vienna have issued
a joint manifesto declaring that Rus
sia is threatened with another fa
mine as disastrous as that of 193.1
and appealing "to the conscience of
the world to avoid a repetition of
the tragedy."
The relief organizations con
cerned said they were of the "firm
conviction that a considerable part
of the Russian population is once
again in imminent danger of
famine."
