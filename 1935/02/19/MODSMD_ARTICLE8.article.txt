### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 18 </P)â€”A
crudely fashioned bomb sent by mail
to the Senate office of Huey P. Long
failed to explode when opened today,
but sent government agencies and
the senator himself in search of the
sender.
Apparently ft chemical affair, the
bomb threw Long's office into con
fusion when opened by a secretary.
But the bottle within had smashed
in the mails and was almost empty.
