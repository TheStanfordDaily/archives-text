# RECORD BUDGET FIGURE QUOTED BY ARMY, NAVY
## 800 Million Dollars Asked By War Department For U. S. Defense HIGHEST SINCE 1921 Allowance For Air Corps Virtually Doubled 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 19 </P) —By .
far the largest budget for national j
defense since 1921 was foreshadowed
today with the House debut of a !
War Department appropriation bill
carrying $318,131,482 for military
activities alone.
The navy .supply bill is yet to be I
reported to the measure but mem- !
bers of the Appropriations Commit
tee said the 1936 figure for the
military service would exceed by
approximately $100,000,000 any de
fense fund since the Washington
naval conference.
Ihe nV»vy bill, it was said, will be
around $477,000,000 and the services'
are scheduled to get an additional
$40,000,000 from public works funds.
Members of Congress pointed out
that once a money bill has weathered
the Appropriations Committee, its
battle is much more than half won.
The War Department bill totaled
$62,583,335 more than the 1935 al
lowance and $672,205 over the
amount recommended in the budget.
The measure dealt liberally with
virtually every branch of the reg
ular service, pledging an addition
al $7,686,753 for airplanes, as well
as funds for the National Guard
and auxiliary units, such as the
reserve officers' corps. The air
corps' allowance was almost
doubled.
The House Appropriations Com
mittee stood ready to provide addi
tional funds if President Roosevelt
takes advantage of the authority the
bill gives him to increase the army's
.strength from 118,750 to 165,000 men,
and the National Guard by 5000 men.
It was the committee's answer to
a warning from General Douglas
Mac Arthur, chief of staff, that "the
whole framework of the national de
fense is so tenuous that if you put
your finger at any one spot it seems
weak and is subject to marked
criticism."
Representative Bolton of Ohio,
ranking Republican on the War De
partment subcommittee, expressed
disappointment ;is debate opened in
the House that the committee had
not provided outright for a 46,250
increase in men.
For rivers and harbors and other
nonmilitary activities of the War
Department the 1936 measure car
ried $60,567,966, a $135,878 cut
under 1935.
The $40,000,000 to be provided the
army and navy from recovery funds
is to be used by the former for
building,. and by the navy for an
airdrome in Hawaii.

.strength from 118,750 to 165,000 men,
and the National Guard by 5000 men.
It was the committee's answer to
a warning from General Douglas
Mac Arthur, chief of staff, that "the
whole framework of the national de
fense is so tenuous that if you put
your finger at any one spot it seems
weak and is subject to marked
criticism."
Representative Bolton of Ohio,
ranking Republican on the War De
partment subcommittee, expressed
disappointment ;is debate opened in
the House that the committee had
not provided outright for a 46,250
increase in men.
For rivers and harbors and other
nonmilitary activities of the War
Department the 1936 measure car
ried $60,567,966, a $135,878 cut
under 1935.
The $40,000,000 to be provided the
army and navy from recovery funds
is to be used by the former for

WASHINGTON, Feb. 19 </P) —By .
far the largest budget for national j
defense since 1921 was foreshadowed
today with the House debut of a !
War Department appropriation bill
carrying $318,131,482 for military
activities alone.
The navy .supply bill is yet to be I
reported to the measure but mem- !
bers of the Appropriations Commit
tee said the 1936 figure for the
military service would exceed by
approximately $100,000,000 any de
fense fund since the Washington
naval conference.
Ihe nV»vy bill, it was said, will be
around $477,000,000 and the services'
are scheduled to get an additional
$40,000,000 from public works funds.
Members of Congress pointed out
that once a money bill has weathered
the Appropriations Committee, its
battle is much more than half won.
The War Department bill totaled
$62,583,335 more than the 1935 al
lowance and $672,205 over the
amount recommended in the budget.
The measure dealt liberally with
virtually every branch of the reg
ular service, pledging an addition
al $7,686,753 for airplanes, as well
as funds for the National Guard
and auxiliary units, such as the
reserve officers' corps. The air
corps' allowance was almost
doubled.
The House Appropriations Com
mittee stood ready to provide addi
tional funds if President Roosevelt
takes advantage of the authority the
bill gives him to increase the army's
.strength from 118,750 to 165,000 men,
and the National Guard by 5000 men.
