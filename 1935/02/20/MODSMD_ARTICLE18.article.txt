He is regarded as one of the fore
j most members of the group of Ger

nomenological school," who took
j their initial impulse from Edmund
Husserl. He has made several im
; portant contributions to the Year-
I book published at intervals by this
j group, and is also the author of a
volume, "Essays in Aesthetics," and a
'work on the axioms of Euclidian

The German philosopher received
the doctorate at Munich in 1904. and
after a year spent in the United
States, chiefly at Harvard, was made
private-docent in that university in
1908. He became a professor at Got
tingen in 1923.
Some of Professor Geiger's philo

sophical views are printed in Eng
lish in the Proceedings of the Sixth
International Congress of Philos
ophy, held at Harvard in 1926. The
same volume contains a paper read
by him before the Aesthetic Section
of the Congress.
