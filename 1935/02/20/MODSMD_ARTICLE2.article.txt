TRENTON, N. J., Feb. 19 (/Pi-
Bruno Richard Hauptmann, con
victed of the kidnap-murder of the
Lindbergh baby and condemned to
die in the electric chair the week
of March 18, today won a respite
from death of at least seven months.
The Bronx carpenter escaped
speedy execution. His appeal from
conviction was thrown before the
state's highest tribunal, the court of
errors and appeals. Hauptmann s
New Jersey attorneys applied for
and were denied a writ of grace by
Chancellor Luther A. Campbell. The
denial automatically placed the
Hauptmann case before the court oi
errors and appeals.
