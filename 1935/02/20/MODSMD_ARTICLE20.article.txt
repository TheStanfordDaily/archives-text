# Auto Casualty Toll Hits High Daring Last Year
## 
### 
Automobile accident casualty toll !
reached a new high in the United
States last year when over one mil- !
lion people wt*re injured and 36,000 [
persons were killed as a result of i
collisions on streets and highways. I
The dominant factors of this rise j
in the toll have oeen found to he i
excessive speed, driving while in- j
toxicated, and bad mechanical con- j
dition of the cars. The fact that the
accident record for stormy weather |
last year was lower than the average â€¢
for all accidents combined indicated I
that accidents can be prevented by I
more careful driving.
