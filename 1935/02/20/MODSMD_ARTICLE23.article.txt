# Eisner Asks Cooperation
## 
### 
Since Cardinal representatives
who have been collecting reading ;
material for the Civilian Conserva
tion Corps are so scattered, Will
Eisner, Cardinal chairman, asks that. I
all collectors bring their books and
magazines to the A.S.S.U. offices j
today or tomorrow.
These contributions may be left
with Mrs. Culver or others who may
be present in the office on the left of
the Union Court entrance.
A.s soon as collected donations
have all come in they will be dis
tributed to the various CCC camps
throughout the state.
Although no definite poll has been
taken a.s to whether the drive was a
success or not, indications are that
a fair amount of reading material has
been gathered.
