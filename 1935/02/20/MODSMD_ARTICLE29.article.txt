# Possible Danger Of Social Regulations
## 
### 
Willi no Nourishing of trumpets, three new
members were initiated into Kx Committee
!;isl night when that hody met in ils lirsl new
meeting sinee Inst Tuesday's cleelion. Oddly
enough, for the first time in many quarters
on the Farm, there is a student government
hody without :i single foot ha 11 player repre
senting some taction or another.
As the primary business lor I lie evening,
A.S.S.I'. President Kahn brought up the ques
tion of a uniform set of proposed social regu
lations for men on the campus.
In an ellort to establish some standard code
of behavior at all men's social functions held
on the campus, the idea of gathering repre
sentatives of fraternities, dormitories and in
tercluh heads together may prove to he a de
sirable move.
(Jn the other hand, there is a distinct dan
ger in the possibilities of social regulation, it
such regulation is ultimately intended to im
pose rigid restrictions upon men on the cam
pus. It is a wise move to clarify the position
of the Associated Students in regard to the
manner in which they wish to run their affairs
on the campus.
Ilowever, there is the possibility of applying
an iron-clad set of regulations upon men,
% which would not only be unfair to them, but
'vould be a retrogressive step. There are in
existence at the present time regulations for
fraternities and dormitories on the campus.
To clarify these and make them more or less
standard is the only logical task confronting
the Kx Committee.
Should efforts be made to establish definite
and fast rules which must be obeyed, such re
striction will end only with disregard for them
and their being Haunted, since this is merely
human psychology.
The honor code is in existence in the I'ni
versitv, and it is assumed that it applies to
every branch of campus activity, including
men's social events. I'ntil it is disapproved,
there may he valid reason for codification of
social rules, hut there is certainly no logical
reason to establish any iron-clad regulations
for men.
