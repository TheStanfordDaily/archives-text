# Another Idea of "justice"

### 
I! is wilh something sikin In :i tooling of
surprise that we find our leMow newspsipcr,
Ih:it so-culled Monsirch of the Dailies, the
Dtiih/ (jtlifornian, luis written in its edilorisil
column si connneiitsirv upon the lluuptniunn
euse which is heurtily in siccord with our own
ide;is iÂ»l ju st ice. 11 10l low s :
One of the most disgusting diiys in the historv
ol Aincriciin justice ciune to sm end when Attor
ncy-(ienersil I>;i\ id Wilcnl/ of New Jersey closed
his ciise ;igsiins| Hruno Richard Hauptmsinn.
The triid throughout its course h;is been sin
absolute fiirce, a side-show for the world lo enjoy.
Dut the fimi! day was by fsir the worst exhibition
of "justice." Crowds snuishcd :il the doors to see
the courlroom, speetsilors obstructed court pro
ceedings iiml copy boys running from the press
row kept up a constant turmoil.
Attorney-dencrsil Wilcntz. sunnning up the ease
against 11 aup 11 nan n. gave such calm, legal opinion
as Ibis:
"Ifauptmann is sin animal: he dresses like a
man, but he is an animal.
"lie would cut out your heart with a razor,
wipe il on his sleeve and go npstsiirs to dinner.
"liauptmsinn is public enemy number one of
all the world.
"I don't like to breathe the same air this man
contaminates. I don't like to be in the same room
Ik is in. Il is not fair to my wife, to m\ children,
ami lo my friends."
All Ibis is about a man who is "innocent until
proven guilty." a man who has a wife and child
of his own, a man who has not as vet run amuck
and killed everyone about him. We stand abashed
at the prosecutor's ability to express himself.
I'.ut is it justice? I)nihi (Uiliforniuti
