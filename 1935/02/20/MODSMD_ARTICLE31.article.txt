A crowd turned mil Ijisl Thursday
nielli and was oil llir whole well pleased willi
I In* program presented by lhal are of modern
composers, Ijjor Stravinsky. There was, how
ever, one point in the whole concert which
evoked comment from most of the listeners.
II was too completely Stravinsky.
Most of the student audience expected when
Ihev entered the Pavilion to Ivear a more di
versified program. No one can lind fault with
the works ol Stravinsky, who is quite justly
ranked as the foremost modern composer;
hnl a whole evening ot his works became insl

;i hit tiresome to the student aiuiienee, who
are not Â»>n the whole ;i eoneert
andienee. In laet, a whole evening ol Much
himsell firohahlv would have heeorne some
what tiresome to a eomparahle audienee ol
earlier days.
The A.S.S.I . Concert Series is designed to
present to an audienee whieh is not yet highly
appreeiative, lor the most part, of heavy
musie, small doses ol the eultural pill in order
to increase its appreciation lor works of Llie
masters, liul these doses should he
! slowly and ini\ed with sugar lo improve the
j taste.
Mad Stravinsky's program heen inter
spersed with compositions hy other musi
cians, il only two or three during the evening,
the concert would have heen more enjoyable
to all.
The (loncert Series management in sched
uling future programs might do well to ask
the artist to make such a concession. The
result will he heller programs, fuller houses,
and more popularity for the Series and for the
recilafist.
