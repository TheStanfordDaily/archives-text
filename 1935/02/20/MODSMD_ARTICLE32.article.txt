With Roosevelt's financial experts advocating the
adoption of a United States Central B;mk to supple
ment or supersede the Federal Reserve, Americans
will watch with more than usual interest the success of
the newly-launched 1935 Central Bank of Canada.
The first Dominion Bank Act was passed in 1.871,
and has been revised five times: in 1880, 185)0, 1900,
1913, and 1923: The sixth revision set up the 1935
Central Bank, and this although Canada has not had
a single bank failure since 1923- —not a depositor has
lost a dollar, while in America since 1921, more than
9,000 banks with total deposits of four-and-a-quarter
billion dollars have closed their doors. Canada has
about a dozen strong branch banks which have 3800
branches throughout the Dominion.
Canada's Central Bank of 1935 has a capital of
$5,000,000, subject to increase. This amount is divided
into 100,000 shares of $50 each, of which no share
holder may hold more than fifty, so that there will be
at least 2,000 shareholders. No chartered bank or its
employes or officers either directly or indirectly may
acquire stock.
Seven directors selected from diversified occupa
tions, none of whom can be interested in a chartered
bank, and the Bank Governor and Deputy Governor,
who possesses the power of veto over the actions of the
board, make up the board of directors. The Canadian
Minister of Finance is an ex officio member of the
board but does not vote. The first board and officers
are appointed by the government, but future board
members are elected by the shareholders, and serve
staggered terms.
The results are obvious: the Central Bank of Canada
is divorced as completely as the law can make it, from
commercial influence or governmental pressure. The
officers of the Central Bank cannot be political ap
pointees, but must be "men of proven financial ability."
Graham F. Towers, the newly-appointed Bank Gover
nor, was formerly assistant general manager of the
Royal Bank of Canada, so brings a wealth of experience
to his post.
The Central Bank can invest in bills of the British
Treasury, or in short-term securities of the United
States or French governments. It acts as a depository
of the liquid (cash) reserves ,of commercial banks,
which are compelled by law to keep on deposit with
the central bank reserves bearing a fixed ratio to their
public deposit liabilities.
The bank is empowered to buy and sell silver, nickel
and bronze coin, and gold and silver bullion. It will
further take over the gold held by the Dominion
against the country's note issue, and goid and bullion
held by chartered banks. In time the Central Bank
will probably become sole holder and purchaser of
gold in Canada.
The significance of Canada's 1935 Central Bank
is of the highest importance. It typifies a world-wide
trend toward central banks that's going on today. A
central bank in New Zealand opened its doors August
1, 1934, and the new Reserve Bank of India will start
business later in 1935—both of which banks closely
follow the Canadian Central Bank in organization.
These banks, with the powerful central banks of
European nations, and the contemplated one of the
United States, point toward the dawning of a brighter
day in international trade. Banking uniformity
throughout the globe will pave the way for an easier
common monetary understanding between the various
states of the world in efforts to revivify trade through
financial agreements. Central banks will also sequester
the gold of the world in certain focal points, favorably
to unity of control and an earlier return to the gold
standard.
