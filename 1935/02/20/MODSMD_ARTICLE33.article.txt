While attending the local production of "David
; Coppfrfijeld'' by Metro - Goldwyn - Mayer's strolling
players at Palo Alto's temple to cinematic art, I chanced
to vent my spleen at the newsreel. It had started out
badly by flashing a picture of a structure that looked
like the Berkeley Campanile, which later proved to be
' the leaning tower of Pisa. After I had become surfeited
J wilh the sight of urchins throwing snowballs on the
streets of London, urchins throwing snowballs on the
streets of Paris, urchins throwing snowballs on the
streets of Berlin, and urchins throwing snowballs on
the streets of Rome, only to hear the dry voice of
I Lowell Thomas say thai winter was here, I voiced my
I official protestation to the ignominy of it all. At this
moment an usher came up and tapped my shoulder.
| Settee: "No booing." Sesame: "You, or a whole tribe of
your ilk can't slop me—MellinkofY is in the audience."
The guy burst into tears and went to join the other ilks.
The Alpha Sig cook, according to the vegetable man,
who is the big news service of the culinary circles up
i the Row. got caught gsimbling in a fan-tan game Satur
day night, and the poor Siggies had to go without meals
for two days.
What the hashers say while they wash ihe dishes
is always a big source of worry to sorority girls, but the
Alpha Phis have solved the problem. Over the Alpha
Phi sink, it seems, there is si ventilator, and over the
ventilator on the second floor are the Alpha Phis. It is
said that this device is installing a Reign of Terror
in the Alpha Phi kitchen. Keep it clean, boys.
Last week there appeared an editorial in the Daily
recommending thsit mid-terms assigned for Friday be
postponed because of the Stravinsky and Du.shkin
! concert on Thursday night. Professor Hulme, one of
those lecturers who continually dins into the students
i his the necessity for acquiring culture by attending
such performances, refused to postpone his mid-term.
One nmsic lover in his class consequently paid 35 cents
to have inserted in the want ads, "Professor Hulme is
unfsiir to organized labor." Charlie, the makeup man,
; is an organized laborer, and he could ra>t see ar:y
I humor in the thing at all.

While attending the local production of "David
; Coppfrfijeld'' by Metro - Goldwyn - Mayer's strolling
players at Palo Alto's temple to cinematic art, I chanced
to vent my spleen at the newsreel. It had started out

J wilh the sight of urchins throwing snowballs on the
streets of London, urchins throwing snowballs on the
streets of Paris, urchins throwing snowballs on the

said that this device is installing a Reign of Terror
in the Alpha Phi kitchen. Keep it clean, boys.
