THE OUTLAW WALRUS
" 'The time has come', the walrus
said,
'To talk of many things.
Of shoes, and vhips. and sealing wax.
Of cabbages and kings'.''
And if Lewis Carroll's garrulous
, old walrus came to visit California
he would find himself a criminal,
and subject to fourteen years im
] prisonment in the stalt penitentiary,
j For in California it is forbidden to
I talk about "shoes," and "cabbages,"
! and especially "kings." In California
we have a criminal syndicalism law.
In chapter 188, of the dry-as-dust
California Statutes of 1919. "crimi
i ral syndicalism" is roughly and in
i directly described as meaning
i "Communism," or any other revo
| lutionary doctrine. But that is just.
I definition. This is the punch: "Any
j person who wilfully and delibera
| tely by spoken or written words jus-
I tifies, or attempts to justify criminal
syndicalism" is guilty of a felony,
and is entitled to 14 years of San
Quentin beans.
I What that means is this:
That if a Stanford professor pre
! sents a plausible case for Cornmu
i .
i nism,
That if the speaker of any sort
i justifies today revolution as was
! practiced in 1776 America,
The professor arid the speaker may
expect soon to be on the inside
: looking out.
In broader terms, the California
criminal syndicalism law means that
] California alienates itself from the
i guarantee of free speech, which "The
Father" and the other great patriots
| saw fit to incorporate in the federal
; constitution.
Now, while we personally cannot
j stomach Communism, we have a
i well developed distaste for "red her
j rings." And we have enough love
j for freedom of speech and thought to
I hold both thumbs downward on laws
| which infringe on that freedom.
Stanford's Walrus Club, which,
like the story-book walrus, believes
j in discussing "many things," is hav
ing a meeting tonight to discuss the
criminal syndicalism law. A former
assemblyman will say the law is
good. A man of God will .say the
law is bad. In the next few years
Stanford students may be called
upon to vote their feelings on this
j law. And tonight is the time to find
i out: "If so, why; if' not, why not?"
