"HEAVEN'S MY DESTINATION."
I>> Thornton Wilder. Harper ind
Brothers. $2.5(1. al the Stanford
Bookstore.
Thornton Wilder, who in 1928 won
the Pulitzer Prize for his unusual
psychological novel, "The Bridge of

San Luis Rey,'*
has once again
written a story
upon the same
order as his ear
lier book, and
forgets the style
he employed in
his perhaps not

so notable "Woman of Andros."
In "Heaven's My Destination,"
Wilder tells the story of George
Brush, self-styled reformer of the
world, who found to his sorrow that
no one took kindly to his efforts to
improve them, and that all person:;
were much annoyed at his attitude.
It is a laughable talc, filled with
Brush's misadventures and mistakes,
all arising from an unusually naive
conjecture regarding the world and
the people in it.
The story is filled with satire, both
of present day life, and satire of
Brush and his exaggeratedly puri
tanical ideas. It will present a dif
ferent story to each person reading
it, whether he wishes to interpret
the work as a severe scoring of mod
ern life, or as a humorous portrait
of a Don Quixote, showing the usc
lessness of attempting to diverge
from the normal.
