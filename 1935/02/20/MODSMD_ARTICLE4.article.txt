# KOO DESCRIBES CHINA CHANGES
## Difficulties of Adjustment Told by Lecturer 
### 
"You can think of the Chinese
people as working toward their 'land
of promise'," stated Dr. T. Z. Koo in
describing "The Remaking of China"
in his lecture in the Assembly Hall
last night.
In many instances using personal
experiences to illustrate his points,
Dr. Koo described the political, eco
nomic, educational, religious, and
social changes which have taken
place in China since 1911. He pointed
out, however, that these changes are
not being accomplished without dis
tress and trouble, for the Chinese
people find it hard to break away
from their century-old customs.
Politically China is changing
from a monarchy to a republic, he
said, and education is becoming
utilitarian rnjhcr than ethical. I)r.
Koo described how as a student he
had memorized many maxims, but
how his son was taught more prac
tical things.
Contrasting the old use of silver
blocks to the modern use of trav
eler's cheques, and describing the
growth of factories and the massing
of capital, he made clear the in
creasing efficiency of the economic
system.
Chinese social tendencies are to
ward the separation of clans into
the immediate family group and to
ward the breaking down of social
barriers between men and women.
With a striking metaphor he called
the Chinese ethical plane one of
"justice" and the Christian plane one
of "love," and he told how the Chi
nese level is gradually rising to the
Christian.
