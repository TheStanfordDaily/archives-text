ABOUT THE 2WO-FOOT
DISCUS THROW

The presence of several women
athletes training for coming Olym
pics by throwing the discus and
javelin on the Angell field oval these
sunny Saturday afternoons brings
to mind a story Bill Ellington often
tells on himself.
Several years ago when the dis
cus circle was alongside the 100-yard
dash straight-away, Bill' Hoffman
was endeavoring to gain a place in
the Stanford weight circus with
Gray, Laborde, etc. Biff's generous
size rendered him a potent force on
Pop Warner's elevens, but he
couldn't quite get the hang of the
discus tossing. Ellington worked
with him day after day, but still the
best Bill could do was 140 or 141
feet.
On Saturday afternoon Hill hap
pened around Angell Field, and
from the west gate vw Biff work
ing out in the discus circle. As
usual, the platter was hitting
around 140 feet. Then Bill cut
loose with a heave (hat made Bill
rub his eyes—the thing went out of
the lot, and cracked into one of
the eucalyptus trees that border
the road Co the sunken diamond.
"Crying out loud, Biff!" exclaimed
Ellington, rushing across the circle.
"Where did you get it? Holy Smoke!
That must be over 200 feet!"
Biff took it all modestly, and
somewhat sheepishly tried to pass
off the tremendous heave as a lucky
one. But a couple of the bystanders
began to snicker, and Bill decided
that something was funny. When a
manager had climbed the tree and
retrieved the discus, Bill found out
that Biff hadn't broken a world's
record at all—he had merely thrown
a junior discus, which is used in
women's athletics, and which weighs
a half or a third as much as the
standard form.

A QUARTET
OF TWO MILERS

Now that warm and sunny after
noons have come along, the 1935
varsity track team is showing such
promise that Dink Templeton .should
have no more "groans" after Friday
meets as he did for the last one. For
one thing, Dink's quartet of 2-milers,
Dave Devlin, Rusty March, Bill
McCurdy, and Bob Alexander, are
cutting down their time considerably
each week.
Rusty, in particular, is liable to
give the track fans a surprise when
he runs for the varsity tor the
first time this spring. Templeton
has been working with the chunky
soph since last No\ ember, and
Rusty is responding to tough
workouts in the same way that
Truck Uellinger did last year. »
As far as marks go, Rusty has had
considerable of a track season .since
last fall, outside of cross country
running, during which he placed
second in the only meet, with Cali
fornia. He has already run a 51.5
seconds 440, a 1:59.2 880, a 4:35 mile,
and a 9:58 2-mile.

CENTERS—GUTTERO,
BALL, AND LUISETTI

Clipped: Leaping Lee Guttero of
(he Trojan centers has scored al
most twice as many points in con
ference basketball as any other
player this year . . . and he looked
so hopeless when he first turned out
for the hoop sport at Pasadena High
that they sent, him out to the track,
so the story goes . . . southern scribes
are booming Ball of the Bruins to
replace Guttero as the coast's best
for next season . . . Card fans will
get their first view of the U.C.L.A.
pivot man this week-end . . . We'd
probably stick with Hank Luisetti
anyway . . . Poloists want it known
that they did not win from San
Mateo Friday . . . San Mateo got the
eight tallies, and they got the six.
