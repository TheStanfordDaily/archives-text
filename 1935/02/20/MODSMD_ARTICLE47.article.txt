### 
Stanford's hopes of successfully j
defending both its individual and 1
I four-man team championships in the
1 California intercollegiate golf tour- :
| nament at Pebble Beach next week
! end received a sharp setback yes
terday when it was definitely an- :
nounced that Lawson Little and Jack
Hoerner, ranking number one and
two men on the squad, will not enter
the competition. «
Want More Time
Both members of lasf- year's win
ning quartet, and the former also
: holder of the individual title, Little
I and Hoerner have decided not to i
play in the intercollegiates hi order j
i to-stretch out their remaining eligi- :
bility. Little, who is not planning to i
be in school during the coming spring j
| quarter, intends to save his contpe
tition for the 1935-36 year, while !
j Hoerner will wait until spring fay I
his last quarter of play. \
With Little and Hoerner with
-1 drawing, Coach Eddie Twiggs has
; chosen a team of Tom Dwyer, Spec
j Stewart, Don Edwards, and a fourth
man to be announced today to rep
i resent the Cards. The three named
| have been scoring consistently in the
■ low 70's on a course equally as tough
as the nationally-famed Pebble
Beach one, but will face strong op
position from the divot-diggers of
U.C.L.A.
Bruins Threaten
The Bruins won the southern con- ,
| ference last fall and apparently have
a decided edge on California and j
U.S.C., the two other schools en
tering.
Other golfers who will participate :
in the individual championship
, match play between the low 16 j
qualifiers include Morse Erskine,
I Bob Thompson, Bill Hoelle, Dalton J
[Henderson, Jeeb Halaby, and Hugh (
! Mellon.
