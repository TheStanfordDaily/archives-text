# Varsity Nine Plays Santa Clara Today
## 
### 
Twenty-two varsity baseball play
ers travel to Santa Clara this af
ternoon for the second Bronco game
and the first off-campus tilt of the
season.
Coach Harry Wolter's nine lost
the first game to the Broncs, 6-5,
but have shown decided improve
ment since, and if the right side of
the infield plays airtight ball, a vic
tory would be no surprise. The only
change will be made at third base,
where Hank Edwards gets the call.
Fred Heringer, Indian mound ace,
again gets the hurling assignment,
with Mike Ferro behind the bat.
The rest of the lineup remains the
same, with Mallatratt at first, Wool
ley at second. Zamloch at short, and
Hamilton, Leidig, and Holman in the
outfield.
