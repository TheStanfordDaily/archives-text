# AIRSHIP HANGAR SCENE OF RITES FOR MACON'S DEAD
## 
### ROBERT EISENBACH 
Sunnyvale Hangar, vast monu
ment to man's greatness, lay trans
formed today into a memorial to his
insignificance.
Not one of the thousands who
crowded onto its concrete floor Sun
day to pay homage to the Macon's
dead missed the comparison be
tween the vast arc of its roof, man
conceived and man-made, and the
greater arch of blue above.
It was not a temple to science
then, it was a temple to God. A
modern tragedy of the sea had made
it so, and that tragedy, more than
whispers of eulogy, twisted the heart
and opened the mind to sorrow.
Those who stood in the great si
lence were not thinking only of
Radio Operator Dailey and Steward

I Florentine) Edquiba, who went down
with the navy's sky ship off Point
Sur.
They were also sorrowing for the
I deaths of hundreds more, sacrificed
j to man's conquest of nature.
Words there were — conventional
j words of mourning, of comfort, of
| renewed allegiance to God. But the
■ ears of that little human smear, hud-
I died about the blunted instruments
| of its fight with nature, heard more
than sentiment and high prayer,
j They heard the whistle of wind,
I the splash of rain, the terrifying
! crunch of crumpling metal, the eter
nal slosh of the waves, crushing a
new and greater Pegasus, but with
it an older rider, who has not yet
learned to build with nature, not
against her.
