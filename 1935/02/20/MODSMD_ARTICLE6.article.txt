# Masquers Name Three Contest-Winning Plays
## 
### 
The three one-act plays chosen as
winners of the Masquers contest
were announced yesterday by Jean
Albertson, president of the organi
zation.
The three are: "Miss Gundle Goes
Out," by Brobury Ellis, "Twelve
Decide," by Norman Stines, and
"Bread and Honey." by James Benet.
The plays were picked by a faculty
committee consisting of Dr. Margery
Bailey, Miss Elisabeth Buckingham,
and George Hinkle. Masquers will
present a reading of these plays in
the Little Theatre a week from
Thursday.

Possibilities of converting an un
employment problem into a means
of industrializing the West will be
discussed here by a group of Western
Senators and Representatives.
