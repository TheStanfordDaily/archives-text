# WRENN TELLS OF OPPORTUNITIES IN MANAGERIAL WORK
## College Graduates Lead In Public Profession 
### 
For those interested in the city
manager profession, the Vocational
j Guidance Committee through Dr.
! Gilbert C. Wrenn gives the following
| information:
There are 425 cities and 8 counties
iin the United States that have
I adopted the city manager plan. Ap
| proximately two-thirds of these city
I managers have attended college, and
I over half of them are college grad
! uates. Over three-fourths of the
| training of the men now in service
i has been in engineering.
Field Broadening
An increasing number, however,
| are going into this field directly from
j training in public administration and
I political science. At the present time
j there are six schools with such train
i ing courses: Institute of Public Ad
j ministration in New York City, Stan
! ford, University of Michigan, Uni
i versity of California, Syracuse, and
i Texas Agricultural and Mechanical
i College. Most of these training in
| stitutions make an attempt to com
' bine work in the college with prac
: tical experience in municipalities.
| The average or typical city man
| nger appears about as follows: He
j is engaged in one or more public
j positions other than city mana
i gership since leaving college. He
| received his first appointment as
j city manager at the age of 37. lie
I may or may not be a resident of
| the city which chooses him to
j handle its administrative prob
lems. He has served as city mana
| ger for between five and six years.
Most city managers have coin
| paratively short tenure.
This vocation is rapidly assuming
j the aspect of a profession, having a
! national professional association and
I a high standard of ethics. The city
j manager is ordinarily chosen by a
| city council who selects him as
; carefully as the board of directors
lof a large corporation selects its
j manager. He is definitely the execu
| tive of the council, which reserves
j its legislative functions. Ordinarily
j such a man works under contract,
j which affords a certain amount of
! protection from political changes.
Experience Necessary
In addition to the type of train
j ing suggested above, it is highly es
sential that a prospective city mana
j ger have a wide variety of experi
| ence in business and public adminis
trative fields. While it is sometimes
l possible to become an assistant to a
| city manager in a large city, it is
j more likely that a man will have to
| get experience in related business in
j public fields.

j manager is ordinarily chosen by a

; carefully as the board of directors
lof a large corporation selects its

Experience Necessary
In addition to the type of train

sential that a prospective city mana
j ger have a wide variety of experi

trative fields. While it is sometimes
l possible to become an assistant to a

j more likely that a man will have to
| get experience in related business in
j public fields.
For those interested in the city
manager profession, the Vocational
j Guidance Committee through Dr.
! Gilbert C. Wrenn gives the following
| information:
There are 425 cities and 8 counties
iin the United States that have
I adopted the city manager plan. Ap
| proximately two-thirds of these city
I managers have attended college, and
I over half of them are college grad
! uates. Over three-fourths of the
| training of the men now in service
i has been in engineering.
Field Broadening
An increasing number, however,
| are going into this field directly from
j training in public administration and
I political science. At the present time
j there are six schools with such train
i ing courses: Institute of Public Ad
j ministration in New York City, Stan
! ford, University of Michigan, Uni
i versity of California, Syracuse, and
i Texas Agricultural and Mechanical
i College. Most of these training in
| stitutions make an attempt to com
' bine work in the college with prac
: tical experience in municipalities.
| The average or typical city man
| nger appears about as follows: He
j is engaged in one or more public
j positions other than city mana
i gership since leaving college. He
| received his first appointment as
j city manager at the age of 37. lie
I may or may not be a resident of
| the city which chooses him to
j handle its administrative prob
lems. He has served as city mana
| ger for between five and six years.
Most city managers have coin
| paratively short tenure.
This vocation is rapidly assuming
j the aspect of a profession, having a
