## Private Business Gain Will Increase Volume Of Cash Spending 
### 
PHOENIX, Ariz., Feb. 19 l/Pt â€”
Roger W. Babson, business econo
mist, forecast here today an imme
diate business boom as a result of
the gold decision.
Cash spending will increase in vol
ume because private business is
bound to gain, he asserted.
Mr. Babson. who styled himself
j an "anti-inflationist" warned, how
| ever, that a "day of reckoning will
I come."
"It's just like a bank cashier
monkeying with a bank's books," he
i remarked. "He can get away with
j it: for a' while, but some day there
j will be a reckoning.
"With the boom in private busi
j ness," he continued, "the commodity
prices and the cost of living will be
! hiked."
Long Term Loans
Bankers will frown upon long
I term loans, he said, because it has
j been demonstrated that the govern
l ment, through the Supreme Couri,
j "can change the entire monetary
| outlook."
1 "The government will find the
! relief burden lessened, because
j employment is expected to show a
j marked stimulus within a short
j time," Mr. Bal>son said.
"Government spending is one oxy-
I gen tank used to revive business," he
j declared. "Inflation is die other tank.
I Now we can change from one oxy
! gen tank to the other to keep busi
i ness alive."
Results Immediate
The fact that the government can
j slow down in its spending, Mr. Bab
son said, "is the one bright spot of
the gold clause decision."
"It is one of the most momen
tous steps taken during the Roose
velt Administration," he said, "be
cause it will bring immediate
! results."
Mr. Babson said he did not know
J "when the day of reckoning will
J come," but for the immediate future
j he said he expects business to travel
| at a brisk speed, indicating the final
i outcome of the gold clause decision
! will not be felt "for several years."
