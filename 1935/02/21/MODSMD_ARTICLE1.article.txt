# F.R. CALLS FOR NRA EXTENSION; FACES TROUBLE
## Labor Dispute Bill Will Be Reintroduced, Asserts Senator Wagner MONOPOLY CONDEMNED Code Officials May Be Tried On Criminal Counts 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 20 (/P) —A
call by President Roosevelt for a
two-year extension of NRA, with a
tightening of its anti-trust provi
sions, today stirred in Congress a
sentiment that promised action in
favor of the business "little fellow."
In heavy majority, congressional
leaders praised that part of the
President's special message which
said, in effect, that additional safe
guards were needed against monop
olies.
Smooth sailing in the extension of
NRA was far from assured, however.
Hardly had the Roosevelt message
reached the capitol, where many
thought it significant that the Presi
dent made but passing reference to
controversial section 7A, than Sena
tor Wagner (D., N. Y.) asserted he
would reintroduce tomorrow his
labor disputes bill.
The measure as entered last year
was aimed at company-dominated
unions, a matter ahout which
much has been heard pro and con
under NRA. Still further dispute
appeared possible under pending
investigations into Nit A.
The President, in sketching his
views of the course the new NRA
.should take, said there were certain
industries which should be sub
jected to more rigid regulation than
others.
"'Che fundamental principles of
the anti-trust laws should be
more adequately applied," he
said. "Monopolies * within in
dustries must not he allowed nor
condoncd. No monopoly should be
private.
"But I submit that in the case of
certain natural resources, such as
coal, oil and gas, the people of the
United States need government su
pervision over these resources de
vised for the purpose of eliminating
their waste and of controlling their
output and stabilizing employment
in them to the end that the public
will be protected and that ruinous
price cutting and inordinate profits
will both be denied."
Amid these developments, it was
authoritatively indicated in other
quarters that NRA officials contem
plated criminal court action against
.some code officials.
