# Wiley Claims Navy Department Knew Of Macon's Weaknesses
## 
### CEDRIC LARSON 
Stating that the destruction of the ill-fat
Macon was due to a combination of reasons
to a single cause, Commander Herbert V. W
day gave his version of the spectacular cr;
Daily interview.
Back from the session of the board of
the U.S.S. Tennessee, Commander Wiley
more in his office at Sunnyvale—the mas
sive hangar standing empty beside him.
The official verdict of the inquiry board
has not yet been given out, but, accord
ing to Wiley, the cause of the calamity is
likely to be laid to a combination of
reasons rather than n single one.
A sudden "jolt" hit the airship prior
to its destruction, according to the Com
mander, no doubt traceable to a sharp
gust of wind—a piece of fabric could
easily have been torn loose and fouled
the controls. The fluttering fabric had
been loosened bv rains and weathering,
and the gust of wind produced a damag
ing lurch, and ripped the fabric severely,
in turn entangling the controls.
The presence of a weakness
of which the navy department was cog
nizant was also a contributory factor in
the demolishing of the leviathan. The
suspected weaknesses were thought to
be in the fins themselves or at the point
where the fins were joined to the hull.
The bureau of aeronautics had au
thorized a .strengthening of the girders 'to
fins were anchored, and by February 10; h
third of tlie I.iOO man-hours allotted for
been put in. This was slow woik, however,
or three men could work ;it a time, and ma
often difficult to procure. Besides, the aii

icchanism functioned faultily and required
mechanical attention.
1 that the United States will not give up
Lion in lighter-than-air craft,' stated Com
mander Wiley. "Although no steps may
be taken for two or three years, I believe
that after the lapse of a short time,
America's interest in this type of craft
will reassert itself.
"With the Graf Zeppelin having made
more than 70 successful trans-Atlantic
crossings from Friedrichs'nafen to South
America, that alone demonstrates the
feasibility of lighter-than-air craft. We
should realize that the present batlle
ships in the navy have been procured
only after decades of experimentation
and constant .structural improvement. If
a battleship is sunk, we don't decide to
abandon the r.avy for that reason, and
as for dirigibles, I feel that experimenta
tion with this type of craft is just in its
infancy and we must not give up due to
one or two failures.
"I feel that the future wiil leveal great
technical advances in the construction of
sturdy and airworthy dii igibles," the
Commander concluded. "Out of such
catastrophes as the destruction of the
earn of weaknesses and imperfections in
JCtion which will be eliminated in future

corporated in a new ship which gives it
over an old tvi>e. I expect to see the
ag fly again from dirigibles just as it
Miirfaec ships of the sea."
