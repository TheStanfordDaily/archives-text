## Hedley, Crist Gives Views At Walrus Club Meet 
### 
"Repeal the 'Criminal Syndicalism'
act because it is class legislation."
"Do not repeal the 'Criminal Syn
dicalism' act because criminal syn
dicalism is nothing mole than ille
gal violence."
Thus stated, respectively, Dr.
George Hedley, president of the
American Civil Liberties League,
and Frank Crist, Palo Alto lawyer,
in debating the "Criminal Syndical
ism" act at a meeting of the Walrus
Club last night in the Women's
Clubhouse.
In advocating the repeal of the
law, Dr. Hedley pointed out that in
practice the act favors the "group
who have" aga.nst the "group who
have not." It is an effort to dodge
the issue and to cover up funda
mentals, he said.
Dr. Hedley laid great stress on the
fact that the law does not punish an
act but punishes the presumed in
tent to commit an act. "This law is
a naive effort to cure a disease by
treating the symptoms," he said. He
believes that the people have a per
fect right to protest against present
conditions when these conditions do
not assure to them the things which
they by right deserve.
Crist, on the contrary, argued that
people have no right either to aid
in committing or to actually com
mit violence in order to produce a
political change, for the constitution
provides that the changes may be
brought about peaceably. He pointed
out that the act has been proved per
fectly constitutional, and showed
how the things which this law pun
ishes are already punishable under
other laws. The significance of this
one, then, he stated, is that the pun
ishment is made more severe.
The speakers quickly aroused the
attention of the large audience, many
members of which heckled C/ist
with questions.
