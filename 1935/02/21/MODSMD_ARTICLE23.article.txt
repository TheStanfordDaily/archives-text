# Stress Need For Ability In Vocations
## Lecturers Say Training Must Be Applied 
### 
What today's student needs is ade
quate training and the ability to
apply it in an original way, agreed
Professor Calvin P. Stone and Pro
fessor Elisabeth Buckingham in their
discussions of the departments of
psychology and public speaking.
Stanford's psychology department,
said Professor Stone, has the ad
vantage of a varied and widely
trained teaching staff. It offers prac
tical work in connection with biol
ogy, education, philosophy, and
other majors, besides listing far
more courses than the average uni
versity.
Vocational outlets are found main
ly in teaching, mental testing, indus
trial jobs, personnel work, actual
psychiatry, or mental hygiene.
"There aren't many opportunities
now." added Chairman Edward K.
Strong, "but don't let that deter
you. CCC training and accident pre
vention are both broad new fields.
Make your own chance."'
After stressing the emphasis which
the Division of Public Speaking
places upon the individual and his
training, Miss Buckingham went on
to tell of the various fields for prac
tical usage of public speaking.
Aside from lecturing and teach
ing, one of the more important fields
is department store managership, or
similar positions requiring personal
contact with large numbers of peo
ple. Acting, radio speaking, conti
nuity work in motion pictures, and
advertising wcrk all profit from this
training.
In addition to the actual studies
in this division, composition, and
English courses in general, and a
knowledge of the languages arc also
important.
Next week's lectures â€¢ will cover
the departments of English, social
sciences and political sciences.
