# Student Speeders Pay $360 for Law Breaking
## 
### 
Three hundred and sixty dollars
is the price Stanford students paid
last quarter for the privilege of
speedingâ€”a modest sum hut one
better than the average that goes to
fill the coffers of the University. Ac
cording to Gordon Davis, campus
officer, students almost exclusively
are the offenders, the faculty being
fairly conservative.
Paying a hearty compliment to
sportsmanship on the Farm, Gordy
declared: "The boys and girls are
always very nice about receiving
tickets. II their emotions get out of
control once in a while, it's because
they're mad at themselves; and I
they're good too about reforming,
that is, I hardly ever get any 're
peats.' There's only one boy on the
campus who has received three
tickets, and very few commit a sec
ond ofTcnse."
