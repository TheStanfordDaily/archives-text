### Irvin Jorgensen

ing groups, the Interfraternity Board
and the presidents of the halls will
meet with A.S.S.U. President Marvie
Kahn next Wednesday at 1:15 o'clock
i in the Ex Committee chambers.

ferent groups.
Alleged Misconduct
Several years ago, because of al
leged "conduct unbecoming" at a
Toyon dance, the President of the
University declared that in the fu
! ture women could not visit men's
rooms during the dances in the
dormitories.
This action was later rescinded,
ciltei - a petition had been circulated
and several meetings held with Dr.
Wilbu''. Instead, the men of the dor
mitory were' placed on their honor,
and several provisions were made
regulating conduct under this
1 system.
Men's Council Rules
As a result, the student govern
ment was made responsible for see
ing that the regulations are lived up
to. Men's Council, Stanford's judi
ciary, is the body that passes on all
infractions of social rules, except
| for liquor violations.
However, the rules are not the
same in all dormitories or living
groups. Toyon has its rules; other
dormitories have theirs. Whereas a
cordon of student, police surround
| the freshman dances, other dances
have comparative freedom.
Codification of .social rules would
give Stanford's student government
a criterian.
