There is an official holiday tomorrow ami
: 111 classes are dismissed; even hall ol Sat
urday has hern declared holiday, and labora
tories and Saturday morning classes excused.
The occasion is Washington's birthday, al
-1 hough tins has very little significance in
comparison to the fact that Friday morning
economics quizzes are postponed, and the
campus is hall deserted.
Old-tiiners who are still in the habit ol
pausing once ;i year to give a bit o! old
fashioned tribute to the first president ol his
country wonder whether we will not soon be
celebrating national holidays per se, rather
than for the men and occasions they were
originally declared to commemorate.
fiction and mystery still follow the tradi
tions of George Washington, despite excellent
biographies, and painstaking research carried
on by scholars who really desire to gel :il the
fundamental facts concerning the man.
Looking into the hodgepodge of intrigue
and conspiracy to which our contemporary
politics have degenerated* there is a feeling
of all the more respect due this simple man,
whose vices many times outshone his virtues,
but who withal was sincere and fearless in
'"•s convictions, and could command the re
spect of his people.
Leaders we have today many of them.
There are the Iluey Longs, the Senator Bilbos,
and the whole shooting works of lobbying
politicians who don their high silk hats to
inoi row and solemnly parade forth to pay
homage to a man who ranks far above them
iu every respect because, unlike them, he was
a statesman.
Were there more such men in public serv
ice today, men who would enter into govern
ment for the delight of grappling with and
mastering conditions that are just as crucial
right now as they ever were in Washington's
lime, there would he a renaissance of politics
in this country, and a much needed one at
I hat.
