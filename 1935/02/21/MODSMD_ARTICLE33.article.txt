In the Association of College Kditors' peace
poll, whiclwillraeted KM) more barm students
than voted in the semiannual campus election
.ol a week and a hall ago, Stanford strongly
endorsed inlernalionalistic and anti-war poli
cies as did overwhelming majorities on the
I 1 7 national campuses.
The fear breeders William Randolph
Hearst, Father Coughlin, Hiram .Johnson, and
Iluey Long failed to drum up strong support
to back their Big Navy and isolation policies,
at least among the colleges. Farm students
broke with the bare majority by voting an
emphatic approval of the I nited States' en
hance into the League of Nations. An Ameri
can navy and air force second to none was not
considered a sound insurance investment to
keep us from being drawn into another great
war.
Possibilities of such a war in which the
I .S. would be involved were strongly dis
counted by the 2-to-l vole. Armed invasion
of foreign territory failed to receive even the
most meager possible backing. Stanford was
most emphatic in the .~>-10-l vole for non-sup
port of such a move on the part of Ibis coun
try. Hut if the nation were invaded, I In* nation
could depend on the strong support of college
students, lite 5-to-l vote indicated.
Heavy majorities in all colleges endorsed
governmental control of armaments and mu
nitions and the universal conscription of all
resources of capital and labor in time of war.
Besides the emphatic peace demands as
shown ii l the poll. Stanford found keen in
terest in the astounding fact that Farm stu
denls took a more active part in the problems
ol tin" world than in a student body election.
Figures show that MSN students voted in Ihc
campus election while 12711 checked ballots
in the college peace poll.
