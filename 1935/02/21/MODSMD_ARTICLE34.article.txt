# Some Antiquated Laws
## 
### 
While a Sacramento jury ponders the fate
of lifleen defendants accused of violating the
Criminal Syndicalism Act. s J i 11 another in
teresting pjiase of that antiquated law makes
ils appearance.
These and other defendants have admitted

on the witness stand that the doctrines they ,
preach advocate overthrow of the government
by violence, and that interpretation has lie- |
come generally accepted.
NO act of violence must occur in order to
make the speaker or writer a "dangerous radi
cal," nor must his writing or speaking he fol
lowed hv such an act on the part of others.
The mere fact thai a person slates his belief in
Communism is enough evidence for the stale
to convict him.
Hut the strange aspect appears when the
Communist party is seen as a legal political j
group under state law. II has a ticket, can- j
didates, and a separate hallol in elections.
And therefore, under the letter of that
much-discussed statute, any candidate who
runs oil that ticket or even any voter who
registers Communist (both legal acts under
the law) ;it the same time confesses a belief
which automatically makes him f/uiltif ami
liable lo a penitentiary sentence of from one j
to fourteen i/cars.
Modification or repeal of such inane and !
Fascislic laws is the duty of the California
Legislature. II that duty is not fulfilled there
still remains the initiative petition.
