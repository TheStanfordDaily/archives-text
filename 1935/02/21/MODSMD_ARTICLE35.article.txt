the Campus Opinion column, Both are open

word-limit rule.
Only by rigid enforcement of this rule can
this newspaper find room in four pages for all
necessary news, features, and pictures, as well
as affording an equal opportunity to :ill for
expressing opinion. The shorter they are, the
more likely to be read in print.
Remember the laws of libel and common
