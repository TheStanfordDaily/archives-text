# WASHINGTON
## 
### JOHN McCELLAND 
NO GOD AND NO PRUDE
Gracing the cover of a popular magazine this week
is an inspiring and touching portrait of the man to
whom the nation will pay homage tomorrow, The man
is shown kneeling in the snow at Valley Forge offering
i up a prayer to the heavens. It is a picture of George
Washington, the man about whom more lies are told
than any other great American.
The kneeling scene is typical of some of the grosser
lies concocted about the life of America's first president
who is deserving of every honor paid him by his
country without having his spirit embarassed by pre
posterous stories which tend to make of Washington a
god-like and completely prudish individual.
There is no more historical evidence showing (hat
Washington ever kneeled in prayer at Valley Forge
than there is proving he once cut down his father's
| cherry tree. As a matter of fact, innumerable letters
seem to indicate lhat Washington ne/er once even
mentioned the name of Christ, and it is a known fact
that he would never kneel, even in church, and uni
formly and conspicuously refused communion. Perhaps
one can have more actual respect for the first president
after a glance at what is a true picture of the man as
historians see him.
Washington wa.s unhealthy. He had stooped shoul
ders, weak lungs; his face was covered with pockrnaiks;
[ he early lost his teeth and was tortured the rest of his
life with ill-fitting false ones; and in old age he became
very hard of hearing and almost blind. His hands were
enormous, and at 13 he was wearing a size 13 shoe. He
1 was a poor speller and grammarian. While a young
man he was frequently jilted, and finally married for
money, although deeply in love with his neighbor's
wife. He shed tears freely under great emotional strain,
and on one occasion laughed so uproariously that he
had to roll on the ground. He enjoyed billiards and
1 was passionately fond of the theatre, even attending
; when it was against, the law.
Washington loved dancing, and once danced for
three hours with General Greene's wife. He speculated
heavily in real estate, attended cock fights, and bet on
horse races. A frequent card player, he once lost as
much as $30 over a four-year period. As pointed out,
he never kneeled, and on the Sabbath he was known
to have swapped horses. He drank very moderately,
but did operate a large distillery at Mt. Vernon, which
turned out some 12,000 gallons of whiskey a year—a
product in which he took great pride.
A man of good spirits. Washington only occasionally
lost his temper, but when he did, great was his wrath
and not infrequent wa.s his use of profanity,. Lastly,
he lied when necessary, and definite was the rejection
of the cherry-tree story when it was proved that Wash
ington told his revolutionary soldiers that provisions
were coming when he knew perfectly well that they
were not.
BUT A HERO AND A MAN
It cannot be said that George Washington was re
sponsible for winning the Revolution anv more than it
can be said that the prayer, which he was supposed to
have offered up at Valley Forge, brought eventual
victory. The recognized father of our country became
immortal because he possessed two great and out
standing qualities.
One quality was the ability to select will-qualified
men. The men he chose for responsible military and
governmental positions could not have been better
picked. The two outstanding examples of this were
Alexander Hamilton and General Greene.
The other quality can simply be called character.
Washington possssed an astounding combination of
traits and characteristics which were enough to make
most men grpat. Many of his contemporaries surpassed
him in individual meritorious characteristics, but no
man of his age was equal in breadth of fine qualities.
He gave a sense of security and of success to what
ever he supported. When other men fail"d and gave up.
Washington kept on. He possessed will-power, stead
fastness, self-discipline, fortitude, dignity, courage,
honesty, and self-respect--all in a superlative degree.
Not endowed with superior intellectual ability,
originality of statesmanship, Washington was plain and
conventional. He never announced a belief in anything
that was not already believed in by other people. He
took pride in his horsemanship, his farming ability, and
in dog breeding.
Courage, both moral and physical, might be added
as a third characteristic which made of Washington a
great man. He was a natural commander: a man of
sound judgment who voiced his convictions so cour
ageously that he ever inspired respect and confidence in
those with whom he worked.
Tomorrow is the birthday of George Washington,
the man; not of Georgic, the hatchet hoy, or of George,
the snow kneeler.

Tomorrow is the birthday of George Washington,
the man; not of Georgic, the hatchet hoy, or of George,
the snow kneeler.
NO GOD AND NO PRUDE
Gracing the cover of a popular magazine this week
is an inspiring and touching portrait of the man to
whom the nation will pay homage tomorrow, The man
is shown kneeling in the snow at Valley Forge offering
i up a prayer to the heavens. It is a picture of George
Washington, the man about whom more lies are told
than any other great American.
The kneeling scene is typical of some of the grosser
lies concocted about the life of America's first president
who is deserving of every honor paid him by his
country without having his spirit embarassed by pre
posterous stories which tend to make of Washington a
god-like and completely prudish individual.
There is no more historical evidence showing (hat
Washington ever kneeled in prayer at Valley Forge
than there is proving he once cut down his father's
| cherry tree. As a matter of fact, innumerable letters
seem to indicate lhat Washington ne/er once even
mentioned the name of Christ, and it is a known fact
that he would never kneel, even in church, and uni
formly and conspicuously refused communion. Perhaps
one can have more actual respect for the first president
after a glance at what is a true picture of the man as
historians see him.
Washington wa.s unhealthy. He had stooped shoul
ders, weak lungs; his face was covered with pockrnaiks;
[ he early lost his teeth and was tortured the rest of his
life with ill-fitting false ones; and in old age he became
very hard of hearing and almost blind. His hands were
enormous, and at 13 he was wearing a size 13 shoe. He
1 was a poor speller and grammarian. While a young
man he was frequently jilted, and finally married for
money, although deeply in love with his neighbor's
wife. He shed tears freely under great emotional strain,
and on one occasion laughed so uproariously that he
had to roll on the ground. He enjoyed billiards and
1 was passionately fond of the theatre, even attending
; when it was against, the law.
Washington loved dancing, and once danced for
three hours with General Greene's wife. He speculated
heavily in real estate, attended cock fights, and bet on
horse races. A frequent card player, he once lost as
much as $30 over a four-year period. As pointed out,
he never kneeled, and on the Sabbath he was known
to have swapped horses. He drank very moderately,
but did operate a large distillery at Mt. Vernon, which
turned out some 12,000 gallons of whiskey a year—a
product in which he took great pride.
A man of good spirits. Washington only occasionally
lost his temper, but when he did, great was his wrath
and not infrequent wa.s his use of profanity,. Lastly,
he lied when necessary, and definite was the rejection
of the cherry-tree story when it was proved that Wash
ington told his revolutionary soldiers that provisions
were coming when he knew perfectly well that they
were not.
BUT A HERO AND A MAN
It cannot be said that George Washington was re
sponsible for winning the Revolution anv more than it
can be said that the prayer, which he was supposed to
have offered up at Valley Forge, brought eventual
victory. The recognized father of our country became
immortal because he possessed two great and out
standing qualities.
One quality was the ability to select will-qualified
men. The men he chose for responsible military and
governmental positions could not have been better
picked. The two outstanding examples of this were
Alexander Hamilton and General Greene.
The other quality can simply be called character.
Washington possssed an astounding combination of
traits and characteristics which were enough to make
most men grpat. Many of his contemporaries surpassed
him in individual meritorious characteristics, but no
man of his age was equal in breadth of fine qualities.
He gave a sense of security and of success to what
ever he supported. When other men fail"d and gave up.
Washington kept on. He possessed will-power, stead
fastness, self-discipline, fortitude, dignity, courage,
honesty, and self-respect--all in a superlative degree.
Not endowed with superior intellectual ability,
originality of statesmanship, Washington was plain and
conventional. He never announced a belief in anything
that was not already believed in by other people. He
took pride in his horsemanship, his farming ability, and
in dog breeding.
Courage, both moral and physical, might be added
as a third characteristic which made of Washington a
great man. He was a natural commander: a man of
sound judgment who voiced his convictions so cour
ageously that he ever inspired respect and confidence in
those with whom he worked.

great man. He was a natural commander: a man of

NO GOD AND NO PRUDE
Gracing the cover of a popular magazine this week
is an inspiring and touching portrait of the man to
whom the nation will pay homage tomorrow, The man
is shown kneeling in the snow at Valley Forge offering
i up a prayer to the heavens. It is a picture of George
Washington, the man about whom more lies are told
than any other great American.
The kneeling scene is typical of some of the grosser
lies concocted about the life of America's first president
who is deserving of every honor paid him by his
country without having his spirit embarassed by pre
posterous stories which tend to make of Washington a
god-like and completely prudish individual.
There is no more historical evidence showing (hat
Washington ever kneeled in prayer at Valley Forge
than there is proving he once cut down his father's
| cherry tree. As a matter of fact, innumerable letters
seem to indicate lhat Washington ne/er once even
mentioned the name of Christ, and it is a known fact
that he would never kneel, even in church, and uni
formly and conspicuously refused communion. Perhaps
one can have more actual respect for the first president
after a glance at what is a true picture of the man as
historians see him.
Washington wa.s unhealthy. He had stooped shoul
ders, weak lungs; his face was covered with pockrnaiks;
[ he early lost his teeth and was tortured the rest of his
life with ill-fitting false ones; and in old age he became
very hard of hearing and almost blind. His hands were
enormous, and at 13 he was wearing a size 13 shoe. He
1 was a poor speller and grammarian. While a young
man he was frequently jilted, and finally married for
money, although deeply in love with his neighbor's
wife. He shed tears freely under great emotional strain,
and on one occasion laughed so uproariously that he
had to roll on the ground. He enjoyed billiards and
1 was passionately fond of the theatre, even attending
; when it was against, the law.
Washington loved dancing, and once danced for
three hours with General Greene's wife. He speculated
heavily in real estate, attended cock fights, and bet on
horse races. A frequent card player, he once lost as
much as $30 over a four-year period. As pointed out,
he never kneeled, and on the Sabbath he was known
to have swapped horses. He drank very moderately,
but did operate a large distillery at Mt. Vernon, which
turned out some 12,000 gallons of whiskey a year—a
product in which he took great pride.
A man of good spirits. Washington only occasionally
lost his temper, but when he did, great was his wrath
and not infrequent wa.s his use of profanity,. Lastly,
he lied when necessary, and definite was the rejection
of the cherry-tree story when it was proved that Wash
ington told his revolutionary soldiers that provisions
were coming when he knew perfectly well that they
were not.
BUT A HERO AND A MAN
It cannot be said that George Washington was re
sponsible for winning the Revolution anv more than it
can be said that the prayer, which he was supposed to
have offered up at Valley Forge, brought eventual
victory. The recognized father of our country became
immortal because he possessed two great and out
standing qualities.
One quality was the ability to select will-qualified
men. The men he chose for responsible military and
governmental positions could not have been better
picked. The two outstanding examples of this were
Alexander Hamilton and General Greene.
The other quality can simply be called character.
Washington possssed an astounding combination of
traits and characteristics which were enough to make
most men grpat. Many of his contemporaries surpassed
him in individual meritorious characteristics, but no
man of his age was equal in breadth of fine qualities.
He gave a sense of security and of success to what
ever he supported. When other men fail"d and gave up.
Washington kept on. He possessed will-power, stead
fastness, self-discipline, fortitude, dignity, courage,
honesty, and self-respect--all in a superlative degree.
Not endowed with superior intellectual ability,
originality of statesmanship, Washington was plain and
conventional. He never announced a belief in anything
that was not already believed in by other people. He
took pride in his horsemanship, his farming ability, and
in dog breeding.
Courage, both moral and physical, might be added
as a third characteristic which made of Washington a
great man. He was a natural commander: a man of
sound judgment who voiced his convictions so cour
ageously that he ever inspired respect and confidence in
those with whom he worked.
Tomorrow is the birthday of George Washington,
the man; not of Georgic, the hatchet hoy, or of George,
the snow kneeler.
