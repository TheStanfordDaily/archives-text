# BULL SESSION
## THE 						FATHER OF HIS COUNTRY 
### 
Tomorrow is Washington's birth- •
day. Flags will fly, bands will play,
: and everyone will be happy that
George Washington was born, and
i that Friday is a legal holiday.
And as surely as George Wash
. ington chopped down the cherry
tiee, you will find tomorrow in the
| jingo press the Father's ancient
warning against entangling alliances.
You will find the Father converted
| into a blustering and narrow-mind
ed isolationist. You will find the
j white wig and black boots of the
I First President, his stern face and
j high brow poured into the Hearstian
i mould of what a First President
j should have been like.
Thus you will find George Wash
i ington expressing his opinion on
i current-day questions:
The jingoes will repeat that it was
Washington's will that we stay out
j of the World Court.
j The platform patriots will tell you
that the Father would want Amer-
I ica to have the largest army and
navy on God's green earth.
You will soon become not a little
| ashamed of the great George Wash
ington if he would indeed stand for
i all the silly things that will be
I attributed to him.
But we distrust the speakers and

the editors, and all the rest who lay
claim to such intimate connection
with the spirit of Washington that
they can speak his mind for him. It
is impossible to say that a man
would think the same today as he
thought more than a century and a
half ago. That is to deny that the
World moves and that some people
do change their minds.
Tomorrow, when all thoughts turn
to the modest man who started this
nation going, the greatest tribute
that can be paid him is to say that
he was a man of intelligence. His
writings and conduct adequately
bear that out.
If you start, with that as a basi*>,
the stature of Washington grows
v/ith the succeeding years instead of
shriveling into insignificance.
If you credit Washington with in
tellect, then you may feel sure that
he would face the problems of today
in a manner suited to the 20th cen
tury. You may feel sure that were
Washington alive today he would
have changed his mind many times
on the issues of war and peace,
which have changed since 1776.
The jifigoeS do not have a monop
oly on Washington. And despite
what the jingoes :;ay, Washington
was truly great.
