TRANSATLANTIC MERRY-GO
ROUND
At Stanford Theatre
If you feel desperately in need of
film entertainment, and you have
seen everything else between San

Francisco and
San Jose, you
might tolerate
th i 3 fil m. It
.marks the
screen return of
that deft radio
comic, Jack
Benny. More of

Benny and less murder mystery
would have made this quasi-musical
more diverting.
At it is, ihe tunes and Broadway
talent entertain, but only occasion
ally, lor they are held down by an
unconvincing, boring Grand Hot*?l
type of plot. The high spot of the
show is Mitzi Green's parody of
George Arliss. The Boswell Sisters
sing, and ;ome awkward and ugly
dames prance around in sailor suits
The second feature, an adaptation
of Dickens "The Mystery of Ed
win Drood," features Claude Rains,
Douglass Montgomery, ;md Heathei
Angel, ft is not good Dickens, and
it is not good theatre.
