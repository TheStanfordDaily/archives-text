# Indian Cagers Meet Uclans In Two Games Here
## WEEK-END VICTOR GETS CHANCE FOR SECOND TO U.S.C. Cards Tangle With Highly Touted Bruin Friday, Saturday Nights 
### 
Whether Stanford or U.C.L.A. will
scramble with California, the second
position on the coast conference hoop
ladder will be determined when the
Indians and the Bruins meet tomor
row and Saturday nights as the
wind-up of the 1935 Pavilion bas
ketball.
The Bruins are counting on their
two previous wins over Stanford
several weeks ago in Los Angeles to
carry them through this series and
to break their season record of five
conference wins.
The Cards figure that they Tan
take U.C.L.A. this week-end if they
play as they did against California
last Saturday night, and then de
feating the Bears on March 2 can
close in second place. The Trojans,
of course, must defeat Cal in the two
games in Los Angeles this week
end, which dopesters figure they can
do.
Stellar Squad
Besides John "Goon" Ball, hailed
as one of the greatest hardwood ar
tists ever to reach the Westwood
campus, and as the find of the 1935
season, Caddy Works is bringing to
the Stanford series a pair of polished
guards in Don Ashen and Bill Max
well. Ashen plays the same type of
steady game that made Hal Edelen
of Stanford an all-coast player last
year, and Bruin critics show that in
fight games opposing forwards have
made but 32 points over Ashen's
territory.
Orv Appleby and Bill Reitz have
been playing (he forward positions,
and are veterans on the Bruin squad.
Appleby was the only man to garner
a normal number of points when
U.C.L.A. was trounced by the Tro
jans last Friday night 55-22.
Two nt Center
Center position is being divided
between the previously mentioned
Ball and Captain* Bill Gibson. Ball
apparently has been in a slump since
he dropped the tieing bucket through
the hoop at the close of the Bruin-
Bear game two weeks ago, even
tually won by the Bruins 39-37. Ball
collected only 1 point against the
Trojans, but, judging by his per
formance in the two U.C.L.A. wins
a month ago, he plays his best
against the Cards.
For Stanford Bunn will probably
start the five that played most of
the California game, Arne Anderson
and Rod Bost, forwards; Keith Top
ping, center; and Dinty Moore and
Robin Lindsey, guards.

Whether Stanford or U.C.L.A. will
scramble with California, the second
position on the coast conference hoop
ladder will be determined when the
Indians and the Bruins meet tomor
row and Saturday nights as the
wind-up of the 1935 Pavilion bas
ketball.
The Bruins are counting on their
two previous wins over Stanford
several weeks ago in Los Angeles to
carry them through this series and
to break their season record of five
conference wins.
The Cards figure that they Tan
take U.C.L.A. this week-end if they
play as they did against California
last Saturday night, and then de
feating the Bears on March 2 can
close in second place. The Trojans,
of course, must defeat Cal in the two
games in Los Angeles this week
end, which dopesters figure they can
do.
Stellar Squad
Besides John "Goon" Ball, hailed
as one of the greatest hardwood ar
tists ever to reach the Westwood
campus, and as the find of the 1935
season, Caddy Works is bringing to
the Stanford series a pair of polished
guards in Don Ashen and Bill Max
well. Ashen plays the same type of
steady game that made Hal Edelen
of Stanford an all-coast player last
year, and Bruin critics show that in
fight games opposing forwards have
made but 32 points over Ashen's
territory.
Orv Appleby and Bill Reitz have
been playing (he forward positions,
and are veterans on the Bruin squad.
Appleby was the only man to garner
a normal number of points when
U.C.L.A. was trounced by the Tro
jans last Friday night 55-22.
Two nt Center
Center position is being divided
between the previously mentioned
Ball and Captain* Bill Gibson. Ball
apparently has been in a slump since
he dropped the tieing bucket through
the hoop at the close of the Bruin-
Bear game two weeks ago, even
tually won by the Bruins 39-37. Ball
collected only 1 point against the
Trojans, but, judging by his per
formance in the two U.C.L.A. wins
a month ago, he plays his best
against the Cards.
For Stanford Bunn will probably
start the five that played most of
the California game, Arne Anderson
and Rod Bost, forwards; Keith Top
ping, center; and Dinty Moore and
Robin Lindsey, guards.
