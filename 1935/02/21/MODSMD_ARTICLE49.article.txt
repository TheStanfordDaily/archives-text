FROSH DIDN'T HAVE
A CHANCE

Aside from the trio of knitting
coeds in the balcony, the fans went j
to the varsity-frosh hoop tilt Tues- '
day afternoon to see whether the
only twice-beaten frosh could trim |
the varsity and whether the frosh
captain and high scorer, Hank Lui
setti, could be as effective a scorer i
in varsity competition as he has j
been against frosh and prep teams !
this winter.
After looking at the score-board
reading "Varsity 42, Frosh 25," at j
the end of the game, most of the j
spectators felt they had learned
neither. The varsity, composed !
mainly of sophomores during most
of the game, was obviously having j
such good luck with their one
handed flyfcrs tint the chances for
possible comparisons were ruined.

QUADE SHOOTS
SEVEN FOR TEN

TROJANS, BEARS
WILL PUT ON SHOW

PAPOOSES WIND UP
SATURDAY NIOIIT

With Luisetti, the result was the i
same but the cause was reversed. !
Hank was probably as "cold" as he j
has been in any game this season, j
his long shots bouncing off the rim. j
He did pass well, but whether he I
will be able to consistently score the j
19 points or so in heavier varsity j
competition, against the type of game •
that California plays, for example, j
as he has in the past weeks is still
to be learned.
Bill Quade, soph forward, pro- j
vided the spark from the spectator's >
standpoint, ringing the bucket with j
the same regularity that placed him j
high in the scoring column last sea- i
son. Seven buckets out of 10 shots |
isn't mediocre shooting on any |
quintet.

While the Trojans have already I
cinched the title, coast conference i
basketball should produce some
hard-fought clashes this week-end,
U.C. going to Los Angeles and the
Bruins coining here.
The Bears may l»e out of the
running for the championship, but
they would rather heat the Tro
jans in basketball than 'my other
team on the coast; and when Nibs
Price and a California quintet
turns on the pressure against a
hefty team like the Trojans, the
i game becomes a knock-down,
drag-out affair. Not basketball,
perhaps, but exciting to watch.
Stanford thinks it can take the
Bruins this week-end, despite their
two previous losses to Caddy Work's
j five several weeks agp in Los An
! geles. If Arne Anderson and Robin
Lindsay can ring the bucket with as
i much regularity as they did against
j California and against the frosh
j Tuesday, the Cards should have no
| trouble staying within reach of the
! Bruins.
I John Ball, the sensational sopho
] more center, makes his first visit to
the Farm. Alter preparations for
| such ace centei's as Lee Guttero and
I Dave Meek, Stanford's under-bucket
and foul-line defense should be so
well finished that Mr. Ball will have
j meager picking in the scoring
! column.

Coach Jimmy Bradshaw's frosh
will wind up the season this week
| end with a record similar to that of
i last year's five—two losses against
I about 28 victories. Tomorrow night
.Piedmont High aims to add a'third
to the loss column, having already
trounced the California frosh. The
I Highlanders are familiar to the
Stanford fans for sending Hal Ede
len, captain of last year's varsity,
Howell Turner, sophomore forward
| and leading scorer, Enul Cowing of
! the varsity, and Dick Lyon, frosh
center, to Farm basketball.
