# STANFORD RUGGERS FACE BRUINS' SQUAD SATURDAY
## 
### 
In their last appearance before the !
j Big Game with Cal, Card ruggers j
i meet the U.C.L.A. fifteen here Sat
| urday afternoon in the stadium.
The Bruins can boast of only a
mediocre season, with a loss to the
Bears a month ago stamping them \
somewhat weaker than the unde
feated Indians on paper.
Several well-known football stars
grace the southern roster-, however,
and will be a constant threat to the
Redskin defense. Backs like Pants (
• Livesay and Ted Key, grid regulars
and hard hitters, and scrum rankers !
! like Verdi Boyer, all-Coast guard,
and Captain Bill Hilleger must be
taken into consideration. Gene
Walsh, flash from South Africa, is
I another Westwood standout.
"Take 'Em in Stride"
Card Coaches Jim Wylie ancL;
Harry Maloney hope to take U.C.
L.A. in their stride, and be ready to
i meet Cal's Bears at peak condition
March 2, but of course mean to win
the game Saturday as well.
Word was going around yesterday

| that the Portland Boomer, Bobby i
Grayson, was coming out for the j
fifteen but confirmation has not been j
| forthcoming.
The regular backfield line will !
probably start again Saturday—Tony j
Cockins, Jim Trompas, Frank Alus- ,
| tiza, Johnny Reisner, Joe Vigna, Bob
j Mondavi, and Ray Lewis. This com- [
bination is improving in its passing j
j rushes, and superiority in this deli- j
cate department was a large cause i
of the victory over U.S.C.
Scrum Lineup Changes
The scrum lineup has been under- I
! going changes every week, but the i
I following boys are fairly certain of !
starting: Dick Morrison, Jerry Pet- j
ers, Fred Abbott, Jim Mullen, Neils |
Larsen, Captain Roger Hager, and
Frank Ingersoll. Right in line for a 1
; call are Jack Walton, Dick Becker, |
Primo Pinotti, and John Merritt.
In the preliminary, the second var- I
sity meets the Barbarians starting
at 2:15 o'clock. Both games will be j
played in the stadium and students j
will be admitted by presenting their |
j student body cards.
