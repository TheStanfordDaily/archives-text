# FROSH HOOP SQUAD ENDS SEASON WITH HIGH SCHOOL TILTS
## 
### 
Facing Piedmont High tomorrow
night and South San Francisco High
Saturday night in the preliminaries
to the Card-Bruin tilts, Jimmy
I
Bradshaw's frosh hoopsters will
wind up their 1935 season this week
end.
Piedmont Best
Of the two prep teams, the Pied- I
mont five will undoubtedly furnish I
the greatest competition, and may |
lick the frosh if they play the "hot" j
basketball that permitted them to j
defeat the California frosh by a large I
margin several weeks ago. The High- !
landers have been winning as they j
pleased in the Piedmont-Alameda- '
Berkeley league play this season and j
have a squad which may not be able i
to match the Card frosh in size but J
may make up the physical disad- i
j vantage in sharp-shooting.
Jumping center against Dick Lyon |
of the l'rosh will be brother Ted |
Lyon, a leading scorer in Eastbay i
j prep circles. T. Lyon's one-handed !
j shots from the foul line have been a ;
| big factor in Piedmont wins this sea- j
i son, and along with forward Fred '
! Van Horn, leads the Highlander j
! offense.
Usual Men Start
Last year Piedmont High sue- ,
I ceeded in matching the frosh dur- j
ing the first half, but found them- I
selves heavily outscored during the |
closing minutes.
Bradshaw will start his usual com
i bination of H. B. Lee and Nelly
Heath at guard, Lyon at center, and
j Hank Luisetti at one of the forward
| posts. Clarence Maurer, Bill Hul-
J bert, and Ed Bigler divided the
! duties at the other forward position
i during the Tuesday game against I
| the varsity, and will probably share i
| the honors in the two coming games. J
