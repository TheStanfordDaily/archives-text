# Alaskan Air Base Urged

### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 20 (/P) â€”
Denying the Hawaiian Island group
is the only defensive key in the Pa
cific ocean, Delegate Dimond (D.
Alaska) today said in a speech in
the House any enemy from the Far
East would ignore those islands in
striking at continental United
States.
He urged establishment of a naval
base in the Aleutian Islands and an
army air base on the Alaska main
land.
Admitting the importance of the
Hawaiian group in the defense plans
of the United States, the delegate
cited straight line distances between
the United States and strongholds in
Japan, showing the Aleutian islands
and the mainland of Alaska would
be the logical points of attack in
case of war.
He argued not only the shorter
distances between United States
cities and the oriental nation, but
the lack of defenses in the northern
territory would make it the logical
victim.
