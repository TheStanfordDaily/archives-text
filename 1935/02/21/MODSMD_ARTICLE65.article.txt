# Adobe Bricks Tell Of Early California Crops
## 
### 
Adobe bricks reveal secrets of
early California crops to George W.
Hendry, assistant professor of agron
omy at the University of California,
who is studying agriculture during
the rule of Mexico in California.
By dissolving the bricks, seeds are
obtained of crops used at the period
of building, since the mud for the
adobe was mixed with straw from
the yards. From this, Hendry is able
to secure information about the early
state crops.
Beer parlor windows in Omaha
are used to teach children pictorial
history and geography.
