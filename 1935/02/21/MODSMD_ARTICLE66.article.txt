# CARD GOLF STARS WILL GUARD TITLE AT PEBBLE BEACH
## 
### 
Indian golfers will be defending
their two California intercollegiate
titles at Pebble Beach this week-end
when the four big Coast universities,
California, Stanford, University of
Southern California, and U.C.L.A.,
meet in an annual tournament.
The individual title, won last year
by Lawson Little, and the four-man
team title have an even chance of
coming back to the Farm, say local
golf critics, despite the loss of Little
and Jack Hoerner, ranking number
one and two men on the squad, who
have stayed out in order to save re
maining eligibility for future quar
ters.
Stanford's team annouriced yes
terday by Coach Eddie Twiggs will
include Tom Dwyer, Spec Stewart,
Don Edwards, Hugh Thompson,
Morse Erskine, and Dalton Hender
son. The four low scores of the six
men entering will be combined for
the team total, with the school reg
istering the lowest score gaining the
team medal championship.
Following the qualifying round to
morrow morning, the match play
tournament will begin tomorrow af
ternoon and will continue through
the 36-hole final match on Sunday.
