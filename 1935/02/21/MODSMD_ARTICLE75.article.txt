# SEQUOIA I DEFEATS CHINESE CLUB, WINS NINTH LEAGUE TITLE
## NO GAMES TONIGHT 
### 
Gaining an early lead and con
: tinuing to function smoothly against
their smaller but fast opponents, Se
' quoia I captured the mural hoop
| championship of League 9 by
trouncing the Chinese Club last
night, 43-12.
Barbash, forward, led the Se-
I quoians in the evening's scoring
j with a tally of 14 counts. Coghlan,
I also a forward, followed closely with
I a total of 13 points. The Chinese
| Club seemed completely overpow
j ered by the aggressive attack of the
! Sequoia men. Scoring honors among
; the Chinese men went to Chan, who
I accounted for 6 of his squad's total.
Earlier in the evening, the Kappa
; Sigs downed the weaker Chi Psis,
\ the final score standing at 20-10. The
I stellar work of Ray, who tallied 14
! points, accounted for much of the
victors' success. Seiger, Chi Psi
forward, led the scoring of that ag
gregation with 7 counts.
El Toro defaulted to Los Arcos in
the third game scheduled. Finals in
the mural tourney will begin Mon
! day night.
\ Professors at the Univei'sity of
j Washington object to the posting of
grade lists, saying they hold the
j student with low grades up to
I ridicule.
