# Gold Ruling Bares Feud In Congress
## Hard Battle Looms Over Three Legal Issues 
### 
WASHINGTON. Feb. 20 (/n—Dis
cussions following in ihe wake of
the Supreme Court's gold decision
aftermath today uncovered a grim
struggle between opposing congres
sional factions which threatened to
burst into open conflict.
At least three issues to be settled
in the near future indicated that the
dispute soon would be •filling pages
of the Congressional Rccord.
Administration officials, mean
while, were studying methods of
strengthening the one spot which
the court's verdict left in their
monetary bulwarks — Court of
Claims suits by federal bondholders.
No action will be taken, President
Roosevelt emphasized 'today, until
the whole subject has been given
thorough investigation by legal and
monetary experts. The high court's
decision will not become effective
for three weeks.
Of more immediate promise in
bringing the controversy to con
gressional floors were amendments,
which many called inflationary, to
be offered by Senators Thomas (D.,
Okla.), and Wheeler (D., Mont.) to
the pending work relief bill.
Thomas wants to instruct the
treasury to purchase 50,000,000
ounces of silver monthly until its
holdings of that metal are one-third
of it.s gold reserves or the price of
silver reached $1.29 an ounce. He
asks that the treasury be ordered
to issue currency against all its
silver holdings.
Wheeler, planning to vote for the
Thomas proposal, said today he
would submit an amendment to
make the costs of the proposed
$4,000,000,000 work-relief program
payable in non-interest bearing
treasury certificates which would
circulate as currency.
