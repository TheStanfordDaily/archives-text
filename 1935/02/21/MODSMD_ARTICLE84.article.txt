# ATHLETICS SUBORDINATED TO EDUCATION IN CHINESE COLLEGES, SAYS DR. KOO
## 
### RICHARD SUTTON 
Dr. T. Z. Koo, Chinese lecturer,
gave his views on American and
Chinese education when he visited
the campus Wednesday.
"Education means morp in China,
I believe, as our social standing has
a basis on learning, .-whereas in
America wealth gives the distinction
of culture. The young Chinese boy
is very proud when he is first recog
nized as a student.
"In America I find a tendency to
give recognition for wealth or ath
letic ability even among the younger
students. This is later brought out
in the colleges, though I see much
desire for learning in your college
and others I have visited in America.
"Chinese students enjoy discus
sion and debating especially. They
are far more interested in politics
and international developments than
the ordinary American college stu
dent.
"Athletics are more prominent in
American colleges. We play foot
bcWl and all your sports, but the
same emphasis does not exist in
China.
Speaking in a distinct, well punc
tuated manner, Dr. Koo went on to
answer a question on coeducation:
"In China our .high schools have
only one sex, but our colleges are
coeducational as at Stanford. I think
it is for better social relations to

; have men and _ women study to
gether, but not boys and girls."
When asked about the appear
ance of the Stanford rough, he an
, swered: ' Dignity in dress is appro
priate for occasions, but I believe
in informal dress otherwise. Your
Stanford men look very clean and
neat, and I like their manners. Why
do you call them 'roughs'?'
