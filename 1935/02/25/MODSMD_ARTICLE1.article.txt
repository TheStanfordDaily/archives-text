# CULTURE TREND ANALYSIS MADE BY DR. DURANT
## American Culture to Bloom A Millenium Hence, Avers Savant AUDIENCE FILLS HALL Speaker Sees New Epoch Of Progress Ahead 
### Cedric Larson 
Setting up a "straw-man" out of j
the Spenglerian thesis that the eivi- j
lization of the western world is de
clining, Will Durant, famed lec
turer and author, proceeded to de- j
molish thoroughly the tenets of the
Munich philosopher before a packed
Assembly Hall audience Thursday
morning in a brilliant display of
logic and oratory.
The New York savant first re
viewed the evidence that ours is
supposedly a dying civilization.
Birth control being confined to the j
upper strata of society presum
ably operates diseugenically as far ;
as the good of the race is con- l
ccrned, he pointed out.
Every economic system stratifies in !
the course of history, with a natural |
concentration of wealth and intclli- I
gence at the top, until a revolution, j
such as the French or Russian Revo- j
lutions, operates as a leveling proc- !
ess, he said, when the phenomenon j
of a restratification of society takes !
place. Durant stated that "categories" j
("classes" is taboo) of workers in j
Russia are already distinguished by j
the Soviets, which illustrated this '
point.
The philosopher observed that i
the present economic crisis would
have manifested itself in America
twenty years ago due to mass j
production and technological un- j
employment hut for the fact that 1
"Europe committed hari-kari in i
our honor in the World War # " and !
became the best customer for <
American manufacturers and pro
duce, thus postponing the eco- j
nomic malady.
The author stated that cultures :
require centuries to crystallize, and !
that an American civilization could !
scarcely be expected to form until j
a millenium had elapsed, and the
welter of races in America had thor- j
oughly fused, producing a new type. |
This, he said, is the mode of evo- j
lution of any culture, and cited j
Egypt, England, and Japan as all j
originally being made up of a het- j
•erogeneity of races which finally
mingled into a new strain through
miscegenation, producing ultima
tely a new civilization and cultui'e.
Durant compared the present
state of American "culture" as anal
agous to that of England in the days
of Alfred the Great, when England
was still composed of many distinct
racial types. "Men such as Emerson,
Longfellow, and Bryant were the
flower of British, not American, civi
lization," he said.
The author closed his lecture with
a not*? of optimism for the future.
Fifteen years after the Napoleonic
wars ceased, Europe, more impover
ished and stricken in 18:'.0 than to
day, entered on a seventy-year pe
riod which was the most brilliant in
world history.
A similar fifteen years interval has
now elapsed since the end of the
World War, and creative impulse
in all lines of endeavor may well be
expected to drown the calamity
howlers and their predictions in a
flood of artistic, engineering and so
cial genius surpassing anything that
has gone before.

logic and oratory.
