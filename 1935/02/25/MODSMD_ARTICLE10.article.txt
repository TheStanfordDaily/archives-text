# NAZIS JUSTIFY HARD POLICIES
## Commemorate Origin Of Creed at Munich Fete 
### 
MUNICH, Germany, Feb. 24 (/P)— .
Reichsfuehrer Hitler, on the 15th an- j
niversary of the day he proclaimed i
the Nazi gospel in a Munich beer cel
lai\ undertook today to justify Nazi i
"hard fistedness" as necessary in •
view of what he called the corrup- !
tion of the regime that preceded his. j
Faith in Nordics
"Unshakable faith in the German j
people," Hitler proclaimed, "was my j
sole inspiration and sustenance at j
a time when the country languished i
in deepest humiliation, when ma- 1
terialism triumphed and when mam- ■
mon ruled.
"When five Germans were togeth- i
er there were five parties. But I j
knew another, a better Germany, |
invisible then to most other people."
Tells Suffering
Before a huge audience in the
elaborate celebration of an impor
tant Nazi event, Hitler detailed the
early sufferings of his regime, which
he said were due to malicious slan
der or misconceptions of the Nazi
aims to save the country by making
one will predominant.
"The fool who still dreams of a
restored (monarchial) regime," Hit
ler shouted, "I say that what once
was can never be again. You will
never return to power."
The celebration in this birthplace
of National Socialism was to com
memorate the day in 1920 when Hit
ler in a hofbrau beer cellar pro-
I claimed his 25 points, these known
I as ihe Nazi gospel.
