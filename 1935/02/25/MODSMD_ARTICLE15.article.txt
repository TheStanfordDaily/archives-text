# Red Movement in Britain Growing, Says Strachey

San Francisco has firmly believed |
since last summer's waterfront strike
that all communist sympathizers
were long-haired and readily dis- |
tinguishable. San Francisco for the j
past two weeks has laboured under
the delusion that John Strachey,
British writer and former member
of Parliament, was a communist,
and. for the same length of time
tried to prevent him from speaking
in San Francisco.
The audience that gathered last
Wednesday evening to hear John
Strachey speak at the Filmarte
under the auspices of the Liberal
Forum, was surprised to find him a ,
gentleman, a charming and intelli- I
gent lecturer, and the proud pos- I
sessor of a sense of humor and a
modicum of American slang.

proeeeded to outline his version of
the dilemma which capitalism now
finds itself. His arguments, illustra
ted with manly stories, received ap
plause from certain sections of the
audience, silence from others. There
seemed to be widespread relief
when, in response to a question

It was of British students that The
Daily interviewer questioned Stra
{ chey backstage at the conclusion of
I his lecture; of students in England
; and of the success of the anti-capi
talist movement in English schools.
Surprised that his interviewer
wanted a statement and not an au
tograph, Strachey said: "The radical
movement among English students
is just beginning. We have never had
one before, and we are just begin
ning to notice one. As a result, we
are also beginning to notice the first
; signs of repression of student ac
i tivity. However, faculty members
in British universities are appar
ently less restricted in their teaching
than are American professors,
though it is extremely difficult to |
gi'iin ■.lirt In addition. Str.nhry rr
marked that the attempts fo sup
press student movement in Eng
land were illustrative of the general
fear of a British radical movement,
and of the belief that it was a mis
take to give student intellectuals
chance to build up radical organi
zations which would become future
Inolitieal nowers.
