# Washington's Greatness Topic of KGO Address
## Human Qualities of Leader Will Be Portrayed 
### 
Washington—plaster of paris hero,
lor swashbuckling roue?—is a ques
tion hotly debated between the
I D.A.R. and debunkers of history
today. But Dr. Thomas A. Bailey,
| professor of history and author of
: the book, "Theodore Roosevelt and
| the Japanese-American Crises," has
I a saner conception of America's No.
1 1 hero, which he will give tonight
j over KGO at 8 o'clock on the Stan
j ford University radio hour in his
.subject, "The Secret of Washing
ton's Greatness."
Parson Weems was godfather to
the Washington-never - told -a - lie
j myth, and the song little school chil
j dren learn to sing, "Who was it
! never told a lie, Little George Wash
ington!" The passage of time tended
|to sublimate the real Washington
into a dcmi-god who only had to
appear at the head of h small Amer
ican army on a horse that was not
skittish, whenever the British came
with a bang! bang! and the Red
| coats fled precipitately.
Along came Rupert Hughes and
j rudely pricked the bubble of Wash
ington's greatness in three huge de
bunking volumes, which have caused
' more comment than any other
American biography ever written.
: Hughes depicts Washington as "one
of the boys" rather than having a
| lofty and impeccable character,
i Dr. Bailey will sketch a word
picture of the great president which
; follows neither of these trends, but
presents a more human and reason
i able view of the "father of his coun
! try." The history professor will ex
plain Washington in terms of the
actual times in which he lived, rath
, er than place him in a non-existent
setting as most of his biographers
: do.
