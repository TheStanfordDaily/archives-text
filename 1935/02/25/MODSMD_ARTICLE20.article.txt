j guard, on Friday with seven.

i In the first game the Indians were
; off to an early 11 to 4 lead when
l Lindsey, Moore, and Bost, swished
' long field goals. Sophomore John
i Ball went in at center for the Bruins,
and the visitors came fast in the
closing minutes to take a 12 to 11
lead, which was tied shortly before
I the gun sounded for the half when
j Moore sunk a free ihrow.
Second Half All Cards'
With Moore tallying with one
hand flyers and dribbling through
the Bruin guards for set-ups, Stan
ford took command of the game
early in the second half. Ken Nobs
replaced Keith Topping at center for
the Indians when the latter's back
j injury forced him from the contest.
Saturday night Coach John Bunn
started a revised line-up, playing
' Nobs at Topping's position and How
j ell Turner taking his old forward
i position, recently played by Arne
i Anderson. The Cards led all the way,
! with the Bruins being unable to
make up for the long shots of Moore,
Lindsey, and Bost.
