# SOUND PICTURE NEDS OUTLINED
## Hollywood Aspirants Hear Inside Dope' 
### 
A distinguished visitor at Stanford j
over the holiday week-end was Jo- j
sephine Dillon, who is the outstand- i
ing acting coach for motion pictures j
in Hollywood. A Stanford graduate, !
Miss Dillon has become an authority i
on cinema acting and sound repro- |
duction to such high success that j
many of her pupils, such as Gary j
Cooper, Clark Gable, and Bruce !
Cabot, have become leading motyie
stars.
Brought to Stanford by the Eng
lish Club, Miss Dillon spoke in the
Little Theati-e last Thursday night
on "Star Building in Hollywood."
Charming and vivacious, she dis
cussed the difficulties of young ac
tors breaking into pictures, the many
attributes required for success
among the average yearly appli
cants at the studios of 25,000 young
actors.
Requisites Listed
Among the requisites she men
-1 tioned a strong limber body that
| will not creak on the sound track, an
I unprejudiced mind that is willing to
learn the difference between stage
; and screen acting, and a knowledge
| of the mechanics of sound engineer
: ing.
An understanding of sound repio
j duction is one of the most notable
' lacks in Hollywood, Miss Dillon ex-
I plained. She made a plea for the
1 establishment at Stanford of a de
partment of sound engineering which
! coul offer the movies well-equipped
j engineers, who might help the per
i fection of talking pictures and also.
; enjoy some of the important jobs
! now held by young Princeton gracl
\ uate engineers.

J lon conferred on Friday with Comp
