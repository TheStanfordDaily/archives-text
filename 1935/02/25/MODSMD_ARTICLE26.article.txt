# SOUND PICTURE NEDS OUTLINED
## Hollywood Aspirants Hear Inside Dope' 
### 
A distinguished visitor at Stanford
over the holiday week-end was Jo-
sephine Dillon, who is the outstand-
ing acting coach for motion pictures
in Hollywood. A Stanford graduate,
Miss Dillon has become an authority
on cinema acting and sound repro-
duction to such high success that
many of her pupils, such as Gary
Cooper, Clark Gable, and Bruce
Cabot, have become leading movie
stars.
Brought to Stanford by the Eng
lish Club, Miss Dillon spoke in the
Little Theatre last Thursday night
on "Star Building in Hollywood."
Charming and vivacious, she dis
cussed the difficulties of young ac
tors breaking into pictures, the many
attributes required for success
among the average yearly appli
cants at the studios of 25,000 young
actors.
Requisites Listed
Among the requisites she men
tioned a strong limber body that
will not creak on the sound track, an
unprejudiced mind that is willing to
learn the difference between stage
and screen acting, and a knowledge
| of the mechanics of sound engineer
ing.
An understanding of sound repio
duction is one of the most notable
lacks in Hollywood, Miss Dillon ex-
plained. She made a plea for the
1 establishment at Stanford of a de
partment of sound engineering which
could offer the movies well-equipped
j engineers, who might help the per
fection of talking pictures and also
enjoy some of the important jobs
! now held by young Princeton gracl
uate engineers.
Confers with Roth
Regarding this subject, Miss Dil-
J lon conferred on Friday with Comp
troller Almon Roth, Professor Fred
erick Terman of the electrical engi
neering department, and Professor
Paul Farnsworth of the psychology
department.
Mis.s Dillon was entertained dur
ing her visit by members of the Palo
Alto Community Players and at a
special tea given for her by Miss
Elizabeth Buckingham and Mrs.
Frances Theresa Russell of the Eng
lish department.
