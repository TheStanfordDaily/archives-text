# A.A.A CAUSE OF FOOD IMPORTS TO STATES IN '34
## Crops Smallest Since 1880; Price Increases Allow Foreign Profits DROUGHT IS FACTOR France Exports Wheat For First Time in History 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 24 (VP) —
Drought and AAA crop restrictions
transformed the United States —
probably for the first time in his
tory—from a heavy exporter into an
importer of feud and foodstuffs dur
ing 1934.
The crops in 1934 were the
smallest since 1880. As a result
prices increased to a point where
other nations could ship to the
United States, scale the high tariff
walls and still make a profit.
Quite a bit of food and reefstuffs,
including wheat, were exported from
the United States early in 1934. But.
with the drought came a sudden
change in habits fixed over the
I generations when the rich Middle
Western fields were the wheat and
j corn granaries of the world.
For the first time on record,
wheat was imported from France
in 1934. Wheat imports from all
countries during the latter half of
1934 totaled 1.231,000 bushels, as
; compared with 175,000,000 bushels
the United States normally exported.
Officials said the value of farm
i products exported in 1934 probably
j had shown a precipitate drop from
1933, when they amounted to only a
! little more than a half billion dol
! lars. Back in 1929 farm exports to
j taled $1,495,790,000.
Import figures tell what happened
! in the year just ended.
Since July 1, 1934, imports of cot
| tonseed cake totaled 34,728,580
pounds, compared with 4,174,775
pounds during the entire five years
preceding.
Out of its average corn crop of
more than 2,000,000,000 bushels the
j United States normally exports
| approximately 10,000.000 bushels
; of shelled corn. Last year none was
available for export. Instead,
j American users imported 1 7 8,650,-
! 822 pounds.
During the latter half of 1934
35,611,000 pounds of cocoanut oil
cake was imported, as compared
with 10,632,000 in 1933. Oats im
ports were 2,729,000 bushels during
the latter half of 1934, as compared
with 15,000 bushels in 1933, and bai -
ley imports for the last six months
of the year were 4,695,000 bushels,
compared with 10,000 bushels during
all of 1933.

WASHINGTON, Feb. 24 (VP) —
Drought and AAA crop restrictions
transformed the United States —
probably for the first time in his
tory—from a heavy exporter into an
importer of feud and foodstuffs dur
ing 1934.
The crops in 1934 were the
smallest since 1880. As a result
prices increased to a point where
other nations could ship to the
United States, scale the high tariff
walls and still make a profit.
Quite a bit of food and reefstuffs,
including wheat, were exported from
the United States early in 1934. But.
with the drought came a sudden
change in habits fixed over the
I generations when the rich Middle
Western fields were the wheat and
j corn granaries of the world.
For the first time on record,
wheat was imported from France
in 1934. Wheat imports from all
countries during the latter half of
1934 totaled 1.231,000 bushels, as
; compared with 175,000,000 bushels
the United States normally exported.
Officials said the value of farm
i products exported in 1934 probably
j had shown a precipitate drop from
1933, when they amounted to only a
! little more than a half billion dol
! lars. Back in 1929 farm exports to
