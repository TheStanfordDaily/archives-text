# The 						Girls of Vassar Go to Town

"Half a league, half a league, half a league on
ward,
Inlo Ihe Valley of Death rode Ihe Six Hundred"
Last Tuesday, some hundred odd women
from Vassar and Skidmore, select and most
proper Eastern finishing colleges on the Atlan
tic seaboard, took stock of themselves and de
cided upon a protest inarch.
Not being particular about what they pro
tested, they betook themselves toward Albany.
And once they were there, the next thing to
do was to accomplish their objective.
And so it will go down in college history
Hint the women of Vassar College protested
the oath of allegiance to their country. They
could have protested almost anything on the
list of grievances against the present adminis
tration and not have raised more than the
usual amount of publicity.
Hut because they decided that standing up
and saying "I pledge allegiance to my coun
try" every morning before their eight o'clock
classes was rather senseless, as well as even
being a bore, a chain of some 21 newspapers
throughout the country saw lit to remark that
our present college generation is practically
worthless so far as a spirit of Americanism
is concerned.
Now, there is nothing exactly wrong in as
suring your country each morning that your
loyalties remain first and last at her call. The
trouble is, not so much in the method of pro
cedure as in the fact that the whole thing is
a hit unnecessary. A college student is going
to be either a good citizen or a bad citizen ac
cording to his or her own dictates. And recit
ing a pledge each morning is not going to
make much difference in the amount of pa
triotism inspired.
I he women from Vassar betook upon them
selves ;i noble duty. They were going to rep
resent their collegiate brethren from all over
the country. They came, they saw, but they
did not conquer. All they received for their
inspired crusade was a moral lecture and the
assurance that theirs was a perfidious action.
All in all, the whole matter seems very un
important when viewed objectively. There is
a Nunan bill, , which demands Ufa I college
students take the oath of allegiance to the
I nited States. The Vassar and Skidmore girls
thought the Nunan hill silly, and their march
proved their contentions. On the other hand,
rabid patriots see in this objection nothing but
hazard for the country's future.
It is not the external show of hysteria or
newspaper emotionalism which ultimately
indicates the allegiance of the people of a
country. It is Ihe calm, unspoken, and indi
vidual thought on the part of people who want
to Know, rather than repeal what may be to
them merely meaningless words, winch forms
the national consciousness of a country.
The girls from Vassar and Skidmore had a
good march, the newspapers some excellent
publicity, and the results of the whole episode
as far as proving anything concrete, amount
to nothing.

try" every morning before their eight o'clock
classes was rather senseless, as well as even
being a bore, a chain of some 21 newspapers
throughout the country saw lit to remark that
our present college generation is practically
worthless so far as a spirit of Americanism
is concerned.
Now, there is nothing exactly wrong in as
suring your country each morning that your
loyalties remain first and last at her call. The
trouble is, not so much in the method of pro
cedure as in the fact that the whole thing is
a hit unnecessary. A college student is going
to be either a good citizen or a bad citizen ac
cording to his or her own dictates. And recit
ing a pledge each morning is not going to
make much difference in the amount of pa
triotism inspired.
I he women from Vassar betook upon them
selves ;i noble duty. They were going to rep
resent their collegiate brethren from all over
the country. They came, they saw, but they
did not conquer. All they received for their
inspired crusade was a moral lecture and the
assurance that theirs was a perfidious action.
All in all, the whole matter seems very un
important when viewed objectively. There is
a Nunan bill, , which demands Ufa I college
students take the oath of allegiance to the
I nited States. The Vassar and Skidmore girls
thought the Nunan hill silly, and their march
proved their contentions. On the other hand,
rabid patriots see in this objection nothing but
hazard for the country's future.
It is not the external show of hysteria or
newspaper emotionalism which ultimately
indicates the allegiance of the people of a
country. It is Ihe calm, unspoken, and indi
vidual thought on the part of people who want
to Know, rather than repeal what may be to
them merely meaningless words, winch forms
the national consciousness of a country.
The girls from Vassar and Skidmore had a
good march, the newspapers some excellent
publicity, and the results of the whole episode
as far as proving anything concrete, amount
to nothing.
"Half a league, half a league, half a league on
ward,
Inlo Ihe Valley of Death rode Ihe Six Hundred"
Last Tuesday, some hundred odd women
from Vassar and Skidmore, select and most
proper Eastern finishing colleges on the Atlan
tic seaboard, took stock of themselves and de
cided upon a protest inarch.
Not being particular about what they pro
tested, they betook themselves toward Albany.
And once they were there, the next thing to
do was to accomplish their objective.
And so it will go down in college history
Hint the women of Vassar College protested
the oath of allegiance to their country. They
could have protested almost anything on the
list of grievances against the present adminis
tration and not have raised more than the
usual amount of publicity.
Hut because they decided that standing up
and saying "I pledge allegiance to my coun
try" every morning before their eight o'clock
classes was rather senseless, as well as even
being a bore, a chain of some 21 newspapers
throughout the country saw lit to remark that
