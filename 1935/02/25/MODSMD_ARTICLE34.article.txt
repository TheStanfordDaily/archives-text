# II Duce and Ethiopia
## 
### 
A quarter million Italiiin troops await I he
signal Cor action in Ethiopia, and tin* rest of
the world wonders just what is behind the
"border skirmishes" thev are supposed to be
there to pul down.
The trouble is sometimes said to date from
as tar bael< as LSi'O, when 2.">,000 Italians were
routed by a superior Ethiopian force and most
ol them massacred. Today militant fascists
proclaim that Italian reprisal "will wipe out
I he shame of 1 <SW>."
Hut that is only the background for a small
grudge. The recent mass movement of Italy
into Africa really arises from the much talked
about expansion program of Signor Mussolini.
"Italy has no future in the west and north!"
he cries. "Her future lies in the east and
south, in Asia and Africa. We demand that
the nations which have already arrived in
Africa do ntil block Italian expansion!"
And so II Duce held a quiet parley with
Pierre Laval, French foreign minister, last
month. They talked of many things: the in
tegrity of Austria, settlement of frontier dis
putes between France and Italy in Africa, na
val equality, and of Italian ambitions where
the luckless empire ol Ethiopia (Abyssinia)
lies.
This is no new idea on Italy's part. Last
year she quietly obtained 10,00(1 square miles
of territory from British Sudan to tack onto
Italian Libya, and by settlement of the recent
Franco-Italian border dispute sliced oil' I .">,OOO
square miles of French West Africa.
By the same deal Mussoiini got hold of a
very small but very important spot of land
adjoining Italian Eritrea which controls the
S! raits ol Bab-el-Mandeb, a base which could
easily cut oft all shipping between the Bed Sea
and the Gulf of Aden.
And b\ the same quiet proceedings II Duce
got 3,000 shares in the strategic ."iOO-milp rail
way which connects Addis Adeba, Ethiopia's
capital, \xith the sea through French Somali
land. '
.lust south of Ethiopia is a strip ol land
known as Italian Somalihind, which borders
the empire on the south just as Eritrea does
on Ihc north. II is on the Erilrean border Hint

recent skirmishes have occurred, although the
earlier "I alu a I incident" was near Somali
land.
* * <t
So Kmperor Ilailc Selassie finds himself
threatened from two sides by Italy, who is
determined to secure reprisal for skirmishes
which she claims occurred in Italian territory.
; Not even the League of Nations knows just
where Ihe border is, and so Mussolini is safe
; so far.
Haile Selassie cannot import arms in prepa
ration for warfare: the railroad is controlled
hv Italy. He cannot strike hard at the quar
ter million Italian troops in Eritrea, or they
will sweep him and his land-locked empire
straight into the Fascist fold.
So the ponderous hlack-heardcd emperor
can only sit and wait for intervention hv the
League of Nations, of which he is ;i member.
France, after Laval's chit-chat with Musso
lini, will not protest, even though she is Haile
Selassie's nearest neighbor. The League itself
is doubtl ul about the boundaries. The Fas
cists cast coveting eyes at the territory, and
more troops and airplanes rush in.
And II Ihice, speaking in Home, says he
| wants "peace with Flhiopia." Hut at the same
time he intimates that there will he the next
line of Italian expansion.
Hritain, France, the League, and His Maj
' cstv wail.

about expansion program of Signor Mussolini.
"Italy has no future in the west and north!"

south, in Asia and Africa. We demand that

And so II Duce held a quiet parley with
Pierre Laval, French foreign minister, last

tegrity of Austria, settlement of frontier dis
putes between France and Italy in Africa, na
val equality, and of Italian ambitions where
the luckless empire ol Ethiopia (Abyssinia)
lies.
This is no new idea on Italy's part. Last

of territory from British Sudan to tack onto
Italian Libya, and by settlement of the recent
Franco-Italian border dispute sliced oil' I .">,OOO

By the same deal Mussoiini got hold of a
very small but very important spot of land

S! raits ol Bab-el-Mandeb, a base which could
easily cut oft all shipping between the Bed Sea
