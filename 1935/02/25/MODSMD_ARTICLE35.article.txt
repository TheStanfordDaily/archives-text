### 
Alter spending nearly an hour last Thurs
day morning breaking down civilization, Will
Duranl, philosopher of note, in ten minutes
carelullv rebuilt man's structure in what
proved to be one of I lie most universally pop
ular I diversity assemblies in some time.
His topic, most aptly fitted to the college
student, was delivered in the manner college
students long to have lectures delivered with
force, intelligence, planning, and humor. The
Assembly Hall, packed as it seldom is, was a
tribute to a well-selected speaker.
Such speakers are rather scarce, it seems,
but, when secured, are well received. A few
more similar guests would (ill the barnish
Assembly Hall every time something that
has not been the custom heretofore on the
Farm.
