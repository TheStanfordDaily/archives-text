Capitol Hill,
Washington, D.C.
Editor, The Daily:
Gold is gone. The nine old men robed in black gave
il the axe. In a little room, rich in historical tradition,
but no bigger than a fair-sized Stanford classroom, the
Supreme Court upheld, in a 5-4 decision, the power of
the federal Congress to say what kind of money shall
be used to meet private obligations, regardless of ihe
tenor of the obligations themselves.
It decided, collaterally, that, though the Federal
Government could not repudiate its gold bonds, a bond
holder suffered no domestic economic loss in being paid
off in devalued currency.
Clearly ami gravely, the Chief Justice read the
views of the majority. Later, Justice Mcßoynolds,
in a voice trembling with emotion, expressed the
minority's views. Chief Justice Hughes loathes
minority opinions. Perhaps the delay in .•<nnouncing
the decision has heen caused by his efforts to bring
tlie Court to a united front. lie squirmed in his
seat as Justice McKeynolds, beside him, lashed at
the breaking of promises, a repudiation which lie
termed "wicked" and shameful. The minority
spokesman, ordinarily soft-spoken, as in his ques
tioning of attorneys from the bench, delivered his
opinion in a voice of compelling earnestness,
pausing frequently to emphasize his words.
This is the last of a series of great cases to be
decided by the United States Supreme Court in a
small chamber in the Capitol. Ones the room served
to house the Senate, before that body grew too large,
and moved to the then newly constructed Senate
wing oi the Capitol. Soon it will be empty, gaped i.-1 by
tourists, while the Court sits in its $13,000,000 \vhite
marble palace a block away.
Perhaps as a symbol of the firm and final grip on
(he ultimate law of the land, held in the hands of this
group of nine men, perhaps as a lofty memorial to a
double-eagle now dead, at ihe very hour when Chief
Justice Hughes was reading the majority opinion that
killed the shining bird, workmen across the way were
raising into place two gleaming golden eagles atop a
pair of tall flagpoles in the forecourt of the new
Supreme Court Building.
At the end of the present term, ihe Court will move
to this impressive temple, bearing on its pediment the
cryptic phrase. "Equal Justice Under Law." No other
sign indicates the building is a courthouse. Sharp-eyed
visitors, however, may read the legend on tiny plates
embedded in the grass, covering the valves of the
sprinkling system. Proudly stamped on each are the
words, "Supreme Court Sprinkling System."
But the Capitol, saris the Court, will be far from a
lonely building. It will still have 96 legislators on one
side, 435 on the other, and the newspapers will still find
each House a cave of the winds.
And the old building is in other ways remark
able. It houses an amazing variety of activities.
There are restaurants, post offices, a railroad ticket
office, a school for Senate pages, telegraph offices,
newspaper rooms, libraries, bakeries, machine
shops, barber shops, and a labyrinthine b iseinent in
which more than one Congressman has been lost.
One recently stumbled by mistake into the subter
ranean bakery of the Senate restaurant, and was
soeechless (imagine!) to find himself surrounded by
six towering aegrns, covered with flour from head
to foot.
The Capitol was built in parts, and i dditions were
made at different times. From this have resulted a
startling variety of floor levels, and many winding pas
sages full of mystery. The narrow stairway by which
British incendiaries entered during the War of 1812
remains, its stone steps rounded and worn. And more
than a hundred feet above flies the flag they tried to
destroy. It waves by night as well as by day, undaunted
by the custom elsewhere observed of pulling the banner
to bed at sundown.
At night, when a few Congressional Committees have
held sessions in the otherwise darkened halls, members
of the Congress have seemed tiny men a* they walked
down shadowy corridors lined by statues of the great of
48 states, lately displaced from Statuary Hall, when
their weight made the floor sag. But men of every
stature come and go, lawyers and lobbyists, statesmen
and jurists, anH the grand old building remains, above
all Washington on Capitol Hill, a symbol of an ideal of
Democratic government that has remained constant
since the nation arose.
Yours.
