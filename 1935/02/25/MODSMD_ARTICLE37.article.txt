# BULL SESSION
## EN ROUTE 
### 
S.P., Section 89, Feb. 21.—1t is a
minute-and-a-half before thi.s black,
steaming caravan swings into the
long, jolting trip to Suit Lake. The
porters are out. toadying late com
i crs into their proper cubby-holes.
Mothers are kissing darling daugh
! ttrs goodbye ("Be a good girl, my
i dear".) Baggage men are getting in
I their last licks, and laughingly toss
I the "fragile" packages into any con
| venient corner.
i There is a large cotfin-like box
| resting on one of the platform drays.
It is draped with an American flag.
"Who's dead?"
"Don't know," says the matter-of
; fact baggageman, "We get a couple
of them every nighl." And he goes
back to work, unperturbed.
Now the long echoing "Allll
I nboardddd." And with chugs, putt's,
| and hisses, the engine lakes a deep
j breath, and yanks the cars into ac
-1 tion. They're off—swaying gently,
I rolling slowly out of Oakland, and
| into the night.
j
Back there is San Francisco, the
] Bay, and Oakland. Coming over on
| the ferry, we told a sailor from the
U.S.S. Tennessee that the Bay Bridge
was being built on unsafe rock, that
it was near an earthquake fault, and
j that a Stanford professor had said
I the thing was sure to fall. "What dif—
j ference does that make," he said,

j "the guys building it get their dough.
That's all that matters." That is the
slipping morality that Will Durnnt
was talking about. That is far worse
i than a dozen slipping Bay Bridges.
Train travel ain't what it used
to be:
t The trains are air-conditioned.
And if you feel hot arid sticky, you
can't blame it on the Pullman Com
pany.
j They don't let you keep your
shoe-string, multi-segmented ticket
any more. You give it up at the
station, and get a small insignificant
stub in return. In the old days you
kept the roll of ticket in youi in
side pocket. At every station yoj
hauled it out, or had a knock-em
dowii, drag-em-out argument with
the conductor. The conductor al
i ways won, and for the rest of the
, trip you would mutter about the offi
ciousness of petty officialdom, and
the damnable efficiency of the rail
roads. That—like the crying ghost
lof Encina, and the almost mythical
Roble tunnel—is gone, or nearly so.
A clacking typewriter in the
clubcar is about «'fs popular as a
j stage-whispering co-ed in the Li
brary. And that man behind the
newspaper has a look that would
freeze even Beezl«bu'o. Good night!
