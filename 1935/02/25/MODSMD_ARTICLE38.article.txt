# CAMPUS OPINION
## DISAGREE WITH G. B. SHAW ON WOMEN 
### 
! The Editor, Sir:
| I have' noticed that certain at
-1 tempts of girls to- revolt against Mr.
Mellinkoff's article ol January 25,
1935, entitled "Back to the Kitchen,"
| met with continuous rebuffs and
| were not published. So 1 have taken
• this opportunity to quote not a "nar
row minded" opinion of ' a woman
j but that of one of the opposite sex's
most celebrated members, George
j Bernard Shaw.
"It is not surprising that our so
! ciety, being directly dominated by
i men, comes to regard Woman, not as
. an end in herself like Man, but solely
j as a means of ministering to his ap
| petite. The ideal wife is one who
| does everything that the ideal hus
j band likes, and nothing else. How to
| treat a person as a means instead of
i and end is to deny that person's
| right, to live." (The men are trying
I to keep women in a subservient po-
Isition or "in the kitchen.") If she
! complains of neglect while hubby is
. playing golf or attending to busi
j ness, "he, the self-helper, can do
j without her; whilst she is depen
j dent on him for her place in society,
I her home, her name, her very
j bread.
"The sum of the matter is that un
less Woman repudiates her woman
liness, her duty to her husband, to
her children, to society, to the law,
and to everyone else, she cannot
emancipate herself. Man's path to
freedom is strewn with the wreck
age of the duties and ideals he has
■ trampled upon, so must hers be. A
j whole basketful of ideals of the most
j sacred quality will be smashed by
| the achievement of equality for
women and men. Tho.se who shrink
from such clatter and breakage may
comfort themselves with the reflec
tion that the replacement of the
| broken goods will be prompt and
! certain. It is always a case of "The
! ideal is dead: long live the ideal."
I May I add that this was written in
! 1800.
Some men are suggesting that we
take a .step backward.

! The Editor, Sir:
| I have' noticed that certain at
-1 tempts of girls to- revolt against Mr.
Mellinkoff's article ol January 25,
1935, entitled "Back to the Kitchen,"
| met with continuous rebuffs and
| were not published. So 1 have taken
• this opportunity to quote not a "nar
row minded" opinion of ' a woman
j but that of one of the opposite sex's
most celebrated members, George
j Bernard Shaw.
"It is not surprising that our so
! ciety, being directly dominated by
i men, comes to regard Woman, not as
. an end in herself like Man, but solely
j as a means of ministering to his ap
| petite. The ideal wife is one who
| does everything that the ideal hus
j band likes, and nothing else. How to
| treat a person as a means instead of
i and end is to deny that person's
| right, to live." (The men are trying
I to keep women in a subservient po-
Isition or "in the kitchen.") If she
! complains of neglect while hubby is
. playing golf or attending to busi
j ness, "he, the self-helper, can do
j without her; whilst she is depen
j dent on him for her place in society,
I her home, her name, her very
j bread.
"The sum of the matter is that un
less Woman repudiates her woman
liness, her duty to her husband, to
her children, to society, to the law,
and to everyone else, she cannot
emancipate herself. Man's path to
freedom is strewn with the wreck
age of the duties and ideals he has
■ trampled upon, so must hers be. A
j whole basketful of ideals of the most
j sacred quality will be smashed by
| the achievement of equality for
women and men. Tho.se who shrink
from such clatter and breakage may
comfort themselves with the reflec
tion that the replacement of the
| broken goods will be prompt and
! certain. It is always a case of "The
! ideal is dead: long live the ideal."
I May I add that this was written in
! 1800.
Some men are suggesting that we
take a .step backward.
