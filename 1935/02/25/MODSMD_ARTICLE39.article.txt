# CONCERNING CURSING
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Just a word or two of protest
against the inordinate amount of
cursing that takes place in Eneina.
Of course we realize that a moder
ate" amount of unorthadox language
is to be expected in a normal group
of men such as are gathered here.
We also recognize the value of the
oalh as a means of relieving one's
feelings in matters upon which one
feels deeply. With this type of thing
we do not quarrel.
However, when one is awakened
in the night or in the small hours

! of the morning by a tremendous vol
lery of obscene, vulgar, and thor
oughly disgusting imprecations ut
i tered in a loud penetrating shriek,
j one is, to say the least, definitely
nauseated.
Another aspect of this situation is
i the undoubtedly deleterious effect
upon the reputation of our fair in
stitution brought about when the
casual visitor is forced to listen to
| some of the boorish swearing which
infests the halls of Encina. We main
| tain that when one must live in
tl'ear that one's female visitors will
be offended, steps should be taken.
W.G.V.
