# U.S. Seamen Still Facing Spy Charges
## Captain lakes Blame For Ship Grounding Off Japanese Coast 
### 
TOKYO, Feb. 24 (/P)â€”'The crew
of the American tanker Elizabeth
Kellogg mu.st .submit to further ex
amination before suspicions of spy
ing upon vita! Japanese fortresses
are lifted.
Freed from a sand .spit at the
mouth of Tokyo Boy but still in the
toils of Japanese military law, the
.ship returned tonight to Yokohama.
Prior to her refloating groups of
Japanese army officers, marine po
lice and gendarmes boarded the
stranded tanker and .shot questions
at the vessel's master, Captain N. T.
Henderson, and other officers, as to
why the Kellogg managed to become
trapped on a sand bar just where her
crew could get an exceptional view
of the fortified peninsulas flanking
the entrance to Tokyo Bay.
Further Inquiry
Although army officers indicated
the innocence of espionage probably
would be established, they said fur
ther investigation at Yokohama
would be necessary before the Kel
logg is permitted to continue her
voyage.
Sergeant Koganai of the Yoko
hama marine police said the Kel
logg's skipper had assumed sole re
sponsibility for the grounding of the
ship last Friday. He said the master
told him he had been celebrating
Washington's birthday and hence the
ship was in command of the third
mate. H. F. Spear, at the time of
the accident. Spear, he said the mas
ter told him, mistook the proper
channel.
Japanese Charter
The Kellogg's crew consists of 21
Filipinos, 10 Americans, one Eng
lishman and a German, none of them
belonging to the United States Naval
Reserve. The vessel was under char
ter to the Mitsui Company of Japan.
Two tugs finally refloated the Kel
logg at 6 o'clock tonight, 58 hours
after her grounding. Most of her
crude oil cargo had been pumped
into other tankers.
