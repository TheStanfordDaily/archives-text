# DESTROYING IDEALS
## 
### 
The Editor. Sir:
Regarding an editorial on Wash
ington appearing in The Daily,
Thursday, February 21: Why tear
down the beautiful ideals and char
acteristics which we have always
connected with our first president?
' Why shouldn't he be God-fearing?
Every really great man that the
world has known has believed in
God and has not been afraid to show
•t. The picture of Washington that
Mr. McClelland has shown us merely
j represents him as a shallow crea
j ture. If he possessed dignity, cour
-1 age, and self-respect for a Being
j higher than himself, it is of no credit
[ to Washington that he did not kneel
; in church, and just because he be
| lieved in a God is no reason why he
i should not be a "Good Joe."
We know that the cherry tree in
j cident is just a legend, but we prefer
to think that our first president did
bow down to someone higher than
himself and did not consider himself
I "Mr. God."
Very truly yours,
Cynthia Hill.
