"OLYMPIA"
Stanford is rapidly acquiring it*
own "Pioyal Family" in the Benets—
James and Rosemary. It was the lat
ter who emerged as the star of Fe
renc Molnar's "Olympia" in its
three-day run at the Palo Alto Com
munity Theatre over the week-end.
Miss Benet seemed thoroughly at
home in her role of Princess Eugenie
Plata-Ettingcn, first lady-in-waiting
1o the Austrian Emperor. Her man
ner and bearing were stately, but her
facile and expressive voice was what
enabled her to portray perfectly the
regal dowager protecting her social
position and her daughter's reputa
tion. The biting remarks she made
to and about the Countess Lina
'added greatly to the spice of the
| play.
Adelaide Perrin, who played the
Counter; Lins, did not seem to be
, wholly consistent in her part, but
after an only fair performance in
the first act she settled more firmly
into the role. Her spiti was well set
off against the wit of Princess
Eugenie.
Marjorie Pabst, who played Olym
pia, Princess Eugenie's daughter, and
George Holt, who was Captain Ko
vacs, her lover, were also inconsis
tent in their portrayals, and never
wholly adequate.
i Joe I -.awry as the loutish Colonel
Krehl, district commander of the
gendarmes, carried off the laugh
honors of the evening, sharing the
major applause with Miss Benet.
His heel-clicking business provoked
much mirth among the audience, as
did his clumsy comprehension—or
rather, uncomprehensior.—of Prin
cess Eugenie's purposes.
i Paul Crary as Prince Plata-Ettin
gen did not appear until the last act
but was most satisfactory when he
did.
Carroll Alexander deserves much
praise for his lovely and stately set.
A skit by Waldo Salt entitled "De
sign for Private Conversation," was
presented on the opening night as a
curtain-raiser and repeated on the
last two nights by popular request.
1 Salt, Harriette Hall Kilby, and Neal
Berry played the parts. The sketch,
which was intended to copy Noel
j Coward's smart inanities, missed fire
I and succeeded only in being utterly
pointless. —Bernheim.

own "Pioyal Family" in the Benets—
James and Rosemary. It was the lat
ter who emerged as the star of Fe
renc Molnar's "Olympia" in its
three-day run at the Palo Alto Com
munity Theatre over the week-end.
Miss Benet seemed thoroughly at
home in her role of Princess Eugenie
Plata-Ettingcn, first lady-in-waiting
1o the Austrian Emperor. Her man
ner and bearing were stately, but her
facile and expressive voice was what
enabled her to portray perfectly the
regal dowager protecting her social
position and her daughter's reputa
tion. The biting remarks she made
to and about the Countess Lina
'added greatly to the spice of the
| play.
Adelaide Perrin, who played the
Counter; Lins, did not seem to be
, wholly consistent in her part, but
after an only fair performance in
the first act she settled more firmly
into the role. Her spiti was well set
off against the wit of Princess
Eugenie.
Marjorie Pabst, who played Olym
pia, Princess Eugenie's daughter, and
George Holt, who was Captain Ko
vacs, her lover, were also inconsis
tent in their portrayals, and never
wholly adequate.
i Joe I -.awry as the loutish Colonel
Krehl, district commander of the
gendarmes, carried off the laugh
honors of the evening, sharing the
major applause with Miss Benet.
His heel-clicking business provoked
much mirth among the audience, as
did his clumsy comprehension—or
rather, uncomprehensior.—of Prin
cess Eugenie's purposes.
i Paul Crary as Prince Plata-Ettin
gen did not appear until the last act
but was most satisfactory when he
did.
Carroll Alexander deserves much
praise for his lovely and stately set.
A skit by Waldo Salt entitled "De
sign for Private Conversation," was
presented on the opening night as a
curtain-raiser and repeated on the
last two nights by popular request.
1 Salt, Harriette Hall Kilby, and Neal
Berry played the parts. The sketch,
which was intended to copy Noel
j Coward's smart inanities, missed fire
I and succeeded only in being utterly
pointless. —Bernheim.
