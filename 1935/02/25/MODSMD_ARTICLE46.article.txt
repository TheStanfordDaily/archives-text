# GAUDS DROP FINAL GAME TO BRONCO BATSMEN, 5 TO 3
## Early Inning Runs Beat Indians As Delayed Rally Fails 
### Johnny Miles 
Harry Wolter's Cardinal nine lost
the third and deciding game of a
three-game series to Santa Clara on
the sunken diamond Saturday by a
5 to 3 score.
The Indians got off to a poor start
as they staked the Broncos to a
four-run handicap in the first three
innings. In the sixth inning the Cards
shoved three runs across the plate
and put five men on the bases in the
final two innings, but were unable to
tally.
Johnny Campbell and Co-Cap
tains Fred Heringer and Stan An
derson hurled for Stanford. An
derson, on the fnound for the first
time this year, struck out three
'Jul allowed three hits in his five
innings in the box.
The big Stanford inning, the sixth,
found the Indians taking advantage
of costly Bronco errors. Red Holman
drew a walk and went to second
when Bones Hamilton reached first
on the third baseman's error. Jim
Wolley walked to fill the bases, and
Holman came home on Ferro's sac
rifice. Hamilton and Wolley scored
on consecutive errors.
