# POLO TEAM MEETS SAN MATEO FRIDAY
## 
### 
A polo feud of some years' stand- j
ing will be continued Friday after- (
noon when Will Tevi:;' San Mateo !
clubmen match their skill against i
the Stanford mallet-wielders at the 1
University polo field.
Judging from results in past ;
games, Friday's match should be no i
one-sided affair and should provide
much of interest to the spectators. '
Tevis' outfit has always provided j
real competition for the local riders i
and should do so again Friday.
March 8 and 9 will find the In
dians in the north playing indoor
games against another traditional
opponent, Oregon State College.
After that game, most of the prac
tice sessions will be held with one
purpose in mind, that of winning
over the strong Arizona four who
will be on the campus during the
last week in April.
Max Snow has been acting polo
manager during the absence of Fred
Bold, now on a debating tour of the
East. He is being assisted by Charles
Thomas. Weekly practice sessions
find a group of approximately sixty
poloists scrimmaging in three sepa
late squads, all trying to force their
way up into the first team of four
riders.
