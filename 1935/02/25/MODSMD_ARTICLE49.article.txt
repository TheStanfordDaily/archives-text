# Uclan Ruggers Score Victory Over Cardinals
## 7-6 Surprise Defeat Is First Loss of Season 
### Warren Breed 
The wind blew no good luck to
Stanford rugby chances here Satur
day afternoon as U.C.L.A.'s fifteen
surprised with a 7-6 victory.
Hay Lewis, the Card demon point
kicker, was called upon to boot what
would have been the winning mar
gin midway in the second half. He
raised the ball over and between the
goal posts, but a strong breeze forced
the pigskin outside scoring ground
before it hit the ground.
Cockins Scores
The try had been made by Tony
Cockins,' who fell on the ball over
the goal line after a scrimmage.
Hay Lewis a little lfter success
fully booted a penalty kick, making
the score 6-7 in favor of the Bruins.
Trailing by one point, the Red
shirts had fifteen minutes in which
to score again, but strong defensive
play held their scoring rushes to no
avail.
Bruin scoring started in the first
half when Captain "Pants" Live
say booted a penalty kick, the half
ending at 3-0.. Eugene Walsh, a
Uclan front ranker, counted the
margin of victory with a neat drop
kick from scrimmage, about 23
yards out, to tally four points and
keep the lead.
Bruins Good on Defense
The game was remarkably even
throughout. Both forward ranks
showed some nice dribbling through
the opposition, and determined
Bruin defensive work and fierce
tackling stopping several long Card
marches. Both teams passed well.
It was a great comeback for the
Uclans, for they had been beaten by
California only a few weeks bofore
and had boen considered outsiders.
In the forward wall Niels Larsen,
Jerry Peters, Fred Abbott, and Cap
tain Roger Hager played well for
the Cards, and the whole backfield
line played consistent games.
