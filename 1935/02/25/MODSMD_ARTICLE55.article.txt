an early lead when Luisetti and

Although outclassed, the preps
came back in the closing minutes of
the opening period, leaving the floor
with but a five-goal handicap at
half time.

to make when the third period

for set-up shots. Center Lew Staehle
and forwards Fred Van Horn and
Ted Lyon led the preps, the latter
scoring 11 points.
