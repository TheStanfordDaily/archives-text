# BRUINS DEFEAT INDIAN BOXERS
## 
### 
Even with a forfeit of two matches,
Stanford boxers were defeated by
U.C.L.A. Thursday night in Los An
geles by 5 bouts to 3.
Heavyweight Ralph MacMiehael
was the only Indian to win his three
round bout, easily defeating George
Dickerson in the wind-up.
Preceding the fight ihe Bruins had
been unable to enter men in the 169
and 179-pound divisions, and Stan
ford was automatically awarded the
two bouts. Card hopes began to
glimmer early in the matches, how
ever, when A1 Velarde lost an un
popular decision to John Odisho of
U.C.L.A. The bantamweight appar
ently was easily the better fighter
and landed the most punches.
One of the closest fights of the
evening was the featherweight bat
tle between Dick Winzler of Stan
ford and Captain Frank Dooley of
the Bruins. Other Stanford boxers
to lose decisions were Bill Sullivan
at 149 pounds, Ralph Purdy at 159
pounds, and Colin McCorriston at
169 pounds.
Accompanying the squad were
Coach Myron Schall and Manager
Frank Hatch.
