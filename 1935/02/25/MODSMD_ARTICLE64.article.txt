## 
### 
BUFFALO, N. Y., Feb. 24 (/P>—
I Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur, president |
!of Stanford University, Thursday
J clared college graduates as a group j
I "seem to have had about as much \
j effect upon the ordinary processes j
| of government as did woman suff- ;
j»age."
Addressing the 20th anniversary |
meeting of the University of Buf- j
I falo General Alumni Association, the j
I former secretary of the interior said !
1 college education is "often a rite,
rather than right—something to be
j gone through as a joint social and
I education enterprise to occupy the
! squab period between youth and j
maturity."
"The public looks on the grow
| ing numbers seeking higher educa
[ tion with a mingling of awe, tole
i lance, hope and fnancial concern. 1
There is wonder as to just what the
j effect will be upon the body politic j
of these graduates who parade each
i year in bizarre caps and gowns.
"So far, as a group, they seem to
! have had about as much effect upon
the ordinary processes of govern- j
j ment as did woman suffrage—just j
; more of the same."
This condition, however, does not [
i hold true in the sciences and pro- |
' fessions," Dr. Wilbur asserted.
"The practical world may raise a
j brow at the college sophomore but
| it hires more doctors of philosophy
I every year to help make the wheels
j go round," he said.
