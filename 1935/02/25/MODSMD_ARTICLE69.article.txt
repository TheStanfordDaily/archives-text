### 
(Editor's Note: For those inter
ested in police work as a career, the
Vocational Guidance Committee \
under the sponsorship of Dr. Gil- j
bert C. Wrenn offers the following i
information:)
At the recent annual convention :
of the International Association of
Chiefs of Police there was advo
cated the creation of a national po
lice training system supervised and
maintained by the federal govern
| mcnt and individual states. Thi.s
! suggests the growing recognition of
| police and crime prevention work
I us a career.
The growing significance of the
activities of the United States Bu
j reau of Criminal Investigation under
J. Edgar Hoover is sure to result in
i the need of more men in this
! branch of the federal service.
Education Advantageous
According to a recent statement
i by Mr. Hoover, college graduates
I are given preference in this field
I provided they have the necessary
j character, personal, and experience
I qualifications. A man may be taken
| on with experience in almost any
j field---law, business, technical work,
! or other backgrounds of equal value,
provided the personal qualities are
present.
More and more police departments
, are interested in men with a good
: educational background. It is my
i understanding that the police de
j partment at Berkeley give.s definite
| preference to college graduates.*
> None of this should be implied to
| mean that mere college graduation
I is an open door to this field. A long
J apprenticeship is necessary, plus
| mental and physical qualifications.
Tells of Parole Field
Allied to police and criminal in
| vestigation work are the opportu
j nities in parole and probation work
| in connection with state and federal
I prisons.
