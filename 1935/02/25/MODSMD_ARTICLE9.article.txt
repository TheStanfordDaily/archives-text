# POST FAILS IN SPEED ATTEMPT
## 
### 

Starting from Los Angeles on an attempted sub-stratosphere speed flight to New York, Wiley Post was
forced down in the California Mojave Desert because of an oil line leak. He skidded to a stop on Murdoc
dry lake in the Mojave, about 125 miles northeast of Los Angeles. The landing gear had been dropped after
the takeoff and Post landed successfully on a wooden skid under the plane fuselage. The "Winnie Mae," Post's
around-the-world ship, was undamaged except for a bent propellor blade. The pictures show the "Winnie
Mac" resting on Murdoc Lake minus her landing gear. (Associated Press photos.)
