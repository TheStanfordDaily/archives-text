# SENATORS HOLD FAST TO STAND ON RELIEF BILL
## Leaders Insist Measure Will Not Be Accepted In Present Form NO INCREASE IN MAIL William Green Says A.F.L. Will Not Compromise 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 25 (A 3 )—' The
21 Democrats who voted against the
administration on the $4,880,000,000
work relief bill wer« shown by a
survey tonight to be standing firm
despite the administration's hope
that pressure from the country
would change their attitude.
That some would refuse to budge
was conceded, but Senate leaders
did not abandon their feeling that
reaction from the states might still
.swerve enough votes to throw the
MeCarran prevailing wage amend
ment oui of the bill.
Deadlock Continues
Several Senators reported their
mail as yet had shown no appre
ciable increase. Those on both sides
of the wage question who had heard
from constituents said their respec
tive positions had been upheld.
Meanwhile, the deadlock con
tinued, with Democratic leaders in
sisting that the Administration's
plan to transfer 3,500,000 from the
dole to work relief would not and
could not be carried out with the
bill in its present form.
Debate Resumed
The measure rested quietly in the
Senate Appropriations Committee
and there was no indication that it
would be brought out again any
time soon.
As the Senate debate was resumed
William Green, president of the
American Federation of Labor, said
on the MeCarran amendment there
would be "no compromise."'
Leaders Odamant
Fervent reiteration by Senator
Robinson, the majority leader, that
the President and those supporting
him had " no intention of breaking
down the private wage scale" and a
sound prediction by Speaker Byrns
that the "House will stand behind
the President" apparently had little
effect on those insisting upon reten
tion of the wage clause.
The Administration was reported
by officials to have planned to pay
a maximum of $50 a month to the
workers taken from the relief rolls.
