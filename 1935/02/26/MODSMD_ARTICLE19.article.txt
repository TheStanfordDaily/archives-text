# Track Meet Will Be Held On March 9
## Masters Quiets Rumors Of Combined Meet 
### 
While a statement from Graduate
Manager A1 Masters quieted excite
ment created by an Associated Press
story of a meet in June between the
combined forces of Stanford and
U.S.C. versus Michigan and Ohio
State, plans for another colorful
meet went ahead yesterday as Skull
and Snakes issued their first invi
tations for the all-University meet
of March 9.
Of the combined meet against the
mid-west teams, Masters stated that
the announcement was premature
as far as Stanford was concerned.
Conflict with N.C.A.A.
The date of the meet will prob
ably conflict with the N.C.2-A meet,
to be held in Berkeley on either the
second or third week-end in June.
Stanford has already indicated its
intentions of entering the Berkeley
competition, and Masters yesterday
believed that the Card-Trojans and
Buckeyes-Wolverines meet would
be dropped. Definite word may come
today, he revealed.
On the all-University meet, how
ever, the Board of Athletic Control
yesterday gave its full approval, and
Skull and Snakes heads began work
ing on a series of great track and
field duels.
Athletes Invited
Besides Walter Marty, world's
champion high jumper, and Ben
Eastman, middle distance ace, efforts
were being made to secure the loan
of George Anderson and Bob Fow
ler of California, providing that the
Bears have no meet thai day.
Anderson, sophomore sprinter who
has a mark of 0:9.4 seconds to his
credit, running against Chuck Voigt
and Jimmy Kneubuhl of Stanford,
would provide two great duels in the
100 and 220-yard dashes. With Norm
Bright, Stanford, facing Fowler, who
registered the fastest collegiate 2-
mile on the coast last year, fans
would see one of the greatest long
distance runs of the year.
