# Child Pianist To Play Here
## 
### 
Ruth Slcnczynski, ten-year-old
musical prodigy, will appear on the
Stanford Concert Series Tuesday,
March 5, in the Pavilion.
This child pianist has a phenome
nal memory and an innate artistic
taste —something which could not be
taught to a child and a faculty of
which many mature artists are de
void. Again and again she astonishes
by her rounding out of a phrase, by
her sense of dynamics, and the ab
solute poise with which she pre
pares for and masters a climax.
The mechanical expertness of her
playing is likewise remarkable, both
for speed and for volume of tone.
The little girl's name has been
coupled with that of Josef Hofmann
more than with anyone else, as mu
sical history goes back to the as
tonishing feats of Hofmann as a child
pianist. Too, it was Hofmann, who,
as director of the Curtis Institute of
Music in Philadelphia, first gave
Ruth recognition.
