Mysterious, bulky envelopes have

speculation has been made over
their contents. It has now been re

book of more than 70,000 words
which has been accepted for publi
cation by a large Eastern publishing
' house.
The volume will contain Lamson's
i own slants on his internationally fa
' mous murder trial, together with his
psychological reactions to prison life
in death row. His conversations with
Leo Murphy, former cell-mate, who
has been hanged since, will also bo
