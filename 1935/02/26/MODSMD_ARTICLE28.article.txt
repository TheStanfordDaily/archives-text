# FARM MORALE UNAFFECTED BY LIQUOR REPEAL
## 'Campus Sane and Sound,' Says Culver in Annual President's Report INCOME IS INCREASED Trend Seen Toward Lower Entrance Demands 
### 
George Culver, dean of men, in the
President's Annual Report issued
j yesterday stated that the repeal of
! the 18th amendment has had little,
j if any effect on the morale and eon
, duct of Stanford students.
Dean Culver stated in the report
that the campus situation is essen
tially sound and sane, and that he
was glad to note a growth of the
"Back to the Farm" movement in
connection with campus sf>cial
j activities.
"Though state highway officials
| have cooperated regarding traffic
| control and regulations, conditions
j along tho peninsular highways have
! not been so satisfactory. There is
j reason to believe that traffic casual
| ties would be reduced if the same
] zeal for public welfare and safely
were shown by tliose having control
| of the enforcement of liquor regula
tions along with some reasonable
j supervision of the personnel of those
1 selling liquor and the typo of places
j they conduct," stated Dean Culver.

Although he believes a partial
j start has been made through the
j recommendation of the Interfrater
| nity Council, Doan Culver feels that
j further work must be done to out
, law organized hazing on the campus.
Financial conditions of the Uni
| versity were indicated as improved
.over last year in the president's re
: port. The average rate of return on
| all University investments for the
j iast fiscal year was 4.0813 per cent.
| as compared with 4.0285 per cent in
; last year's report.
President Wilbur in his report pre
! facing the annual report insists on
higher intellectual attainments, but
j at the same time states that there is
a trend toward less rigid entrance
requirements.

The report states that $13,767 has
| been received from the State Emer
j gency Relief Administration during
j the year for the employment of more
i than 300 students. Dr. Wilbur said
that this fund contributed greatly to
j the support of students who other
wise would be unable to attend
: school.
The influx of more women stu
dents, has not a.s yet made any defi
nite effect upon the courses desired
by students, though there is indica
| tion that courses in music, art, and
I literature will be demanded 1o a
I greater extent.
