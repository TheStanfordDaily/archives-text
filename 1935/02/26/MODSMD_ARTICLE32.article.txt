# Wanted: One Track Captain
## 
### 
With an all-University track meet sched
uled lor next week and the varsity debut
March 28, Ihe cinder men are putting on the
grooming practice touches lor one of the most
difficult seasons, when Stanford will attempt
to maintain a championship standing with a
slightly less formidable than usual team. That
squad, however, faces this important and try
ing year without a captain.
Last spring the custom of electing a captain
was abandoned, temporarily we hope, be
cause of Ihe repeated disasters which befell
every captain for at least the past five years
because of the superstition connected with the
post. To have the captain, one of the out
standing men on the squad, on the sidelines,
nursing some ailment, was considered a de
moralizing factor to the squad.
How did the last five captains fare? (ius
Meier broke his forearm, lien Kastman pulled
a thigh muscle, Ike Hables and Podge Smith
were also in the pulled muscle grouping, and
laic Krenz drowned at Lake Tahoe.
These men, however, were not considered
along with the others, nine of whom we could
name from the past two years, who were also
out for most or all of the meets because of
pulled muscles, bad arms, or like ailments. In
other words, a man was not necessarily the
captain because he happened to meet disaster
on the track the captain was only one out
<il live or six invalids. Furthermore, four of
the live named captains participated in track
events, the type of event which normally fills
Ihe bulk of the injury lists.
1 he advantages of having a captain seem to
far outweigh the disadvantages, or the sole
disadvantage mere superstition. The squad,
because it is a group of men, needs a chosen
leader a custom of the ages. Because that
group is composed of individual stars as few
other sports are, it needs a unifying force,
otherwise it is merely a disjointed group of
athletes. Some member is needed to act as a
liaison between coach and team. One of the
squad is needed to enforce discipline and
training rules, and unless such a man has
authority, his word carries little weight. The
position of captain, furthermore, honors an
outstanding athlete and leader, and serves as
a goal at which track men may aim for their
senior year.
With the regular season, more than "regu
lar" this year, nearly a month away, it is not
100 late lor Stanford, a so-called "liberal uni
versity of high-class intellectuals," to drop
medieval superstitions and sponsor the elec
tion of a track captain for the coming season.
