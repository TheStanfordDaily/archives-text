Modern Germany, long known :is I In* race
of mechanically minded technicians, builders
of superior machinery, transports, and even
children's dolls, reverts backward in its tech
nique of executions.
Kven more crude than the recent wholesale
massacre ot Hitler political opponents was
the beheading of two German women last
week. Incarcerated in prison for many weeks,
they were finally brought out only to be led
to their death. With all the traditional cere
mony due a medieval custom, the two women
kneeled beside the block, and the executioner,
clad with white mask and white gloves, deftly
chopped ofT their heads.
No one can possibly say that such a method
of treating with people opposed to the cause
is not effective. Hut coining with the long line
of a I r< >ei I ii's staged in Germany bv "Per Fin-h
-rer" during the last two years, things are soon
going lo pop.
