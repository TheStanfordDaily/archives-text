## THE 						GOLD DECISIONS—WHAT DO THEY MEAN? 
### CROMPTON BANCS, Jr 
BOSTON, Mass.—As most people expected, the
Supreme Court generally upheld the New Deal's
dollar devaluation policy; the 5-4 decision was likewise
I looked for. Most lawyers had hoped the court would
rebuke Congress for welching on U. S. debts; it did.
So in .-übstanee the decisions amount to saying: "O.K.
this time, but don't try it again."
In-practice the New Deal came out on top; in theory
i the conservatives won a moral victory when Congress'
repudiation of gold payments was declared unconsti
tutional, though the two people concerned in the cases
couldn't collect.
But what do these decisions mean? You will re
member that the U.S. claimed Congress had the power
to regulate the value of money, while the other side
said Congress didn't have the power to strike down
contracts promising payment in gold dollars or their
equivalent. What the court did was to strike a balance
between these two viewpoints by deciding that while
Congress by its sovereign power over currency could
abrogate private contracts hostile to this power, it did
not have the power of repudiating its own pledge to
pay U.S. bonds in gold.
The decision as to private contracts made new
constitutional law, but it did not make any old con
stitutional law. The question its to the power of Con
gress over private contracts calling for payment in
gold had not been settled until the court decided it
Monday. So Justice Mcßeynolds dissenting in very
violent language hits little reason for saying the Con
stitution was swept away.
To exist and defend itself a government must have
power; one of the most important, if not the most
important powers it must have, is the power to regu
late the value of money. This power was put into the
Constitution as a matter of course. Over a hundred
years ago Chief Justice John Marshall in McCulloch
vs. Maryland claimed that it was additionally con
ferred on Congress by all the related powers in the
Constitution, the object being to "achieve the great
objects for which national government was formed—a
national government with sovereign powers." Chief
Justice Hughes merely went back to Marshall's ideas
and built his decision on them.
For a long time it has been settled that some private
contracts could not protect the contractors from the
governmental powers for the defense of health, morals,
and safety. This principle has been applied in the
Minnesota Mortgage Case, where a foreclosure mora
torium in time of emergency was allowed; the Supreme
Court has also permitted legislative interference with
existing contracts between landlord and tenant, em
ployer and employe, and with valid contracts in one
state which were forbidden by the Sherman Anti-Trust
Act.
So it is only a step further to say that since Con
gress has the power to regulate money, it must also
have the power to strike down any private contracts
which interfere with its constitutional authority to do
so. This probably means that Congress has a free hand
in regulating money insofar as private obligations are
concerned. Thus the New Deal's dollar devaluation
program is O.K.'d along this line.
Now as to Congress' power to repudiate its own con
tracts: It is one thing to say that private parties can't
tie the government's hands, and another thing to say
that the government can't tie its own haiids. All the
justices, except possibly Justice Stone, decided that
the government could not repudiate its pledge to pay
the holders of its bonds in gold as its pledge would
otherwise be meaningless.
According to the Constitution the states are for
bidden to impair the obligation of contracts; but the
United States are not, so this must be based on the
due-process clause of the Fifth Amendment. This
clause has no meaning save what the court puts into
it, and it can probably be surmised that the Supreme
Court was taking this opportunity of warning F.R. that
he had told Congress to go too far. At any rate the
court could find nothing in the Constitution or its
previous decisions allowing Congress to repudiate its
pledge, so it declared the action of Congress unconsti
tutional.
This would then allow John M. Perry of New York,
who wanted his $10,000 liberty bond paid in $1(5,931
devalued currency, to sue the U.S. in the Court of
Claims for the money. Being a sovereign power, the
U.S. can withdraw the right to be sued tiny time it
wishes. It is very likely to do so insofar as the holders
of its gold-clause bonds are concerned, or it may order
them exchanged for non-gold-clause bonds.
The Supreme Court's decision set these troubles
aside for the time being. It held Mr. Perry and Mr.
Nortz (owner of gold certificates) had failed to show
any actual damage resulting from the government's
repudiation of its pledge, and so they could not sue the
U.S. at all. In other words, try and get the money.
As a matter of fact, it would be very hard for holders
of most U.S. bonds to prove they had suffered actual
loss. Most of them were issued or bought when the
buying power of ihe dollar was much less than it is
now, so to receive $1.09 for every dollar of face value
would be a very great profit, much more in fact than
it appears at first glance. It would not be a recoupment
of a loss, but a very considerable enrichment—at the
expense of the government.
All in all the Supreme Court has again shown that
it keeps its ears to the ground and its eyes to the
future. It has managed to uphold the government with
one hand while spanking it with the other. It has also
demonstrated that the Constitution is a very flexible
instrument, with plenty of room for our future growth,
and with no need to go outside it or get around it.
