### International Hashers' News Service 
Doc Townsend, unemployed sandwich man, who
picked up a gold mine off the streets of Long Beach,
when he found this revolving old-age pension plan,
found the success of meeting all the Congressmen in
Washington while lobbying for his plan, had gone to
his head yesterday when interviewed by an Interna
tional Hasher.
Townsend denied this, however. "Success h;is never I
gone to my head," he said. "I may not have always j
kept on the alkaline .side, and I may be a bit fuzzy j
and hazy about answering all the questions concerning
my plan, but success never has gone to my head—it |
always goes to my stomach.
"I and Napoleon agree: a pension army marches on \
its stomach. If you'd been kicked out of as many
places as I have, you'd agree with me.
The merit of my plan is that it is a revolving one.
It is just like a squirrel cage. Everyone runs and runs
to beat hell and nobody gets anywhere. The idea is
that if everyone makes out checks to everybody else
for $200 a month, the paper and ink used will cause
nffT.n")'ily tn tl-tnvc Vnu iwill-i ll in n t».twv.
cussions throughout the industry.
"I would also point out that it would pension off
the justices of the Supreme Court, who could settle
down on their S'2oo a month and wouldn't have to |
befuddle themselves with gold clauses."
Doc Townsend then drew himself up to his full
height, looked Our Hasher straight in the eye, and said:
"You have to die, I'm God."
To which Our Hasher replied: "Ya, ya, you can't
hurt mr. I'm Roosevelt."
