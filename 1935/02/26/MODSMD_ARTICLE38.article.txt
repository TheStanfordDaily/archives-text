# BULL SESSION
## SAGEBRUSH. SHEEP, AND SALT LAKE 
### 
SALT LAKE CITY, Feb. 24—It
I is about 800 miles across the Great !
1 American Desert from Sun Fran- j
Cisco to Salt Lake. If you like sage j
brash and .sheep, the Great Amer- 1
; ican Desert is all right. But sage j
brush and sheep are much more j
I beautiful in a Zane Grey novel than 1
' through the window of a railroad
I train. Dust, dirty little shanties, 1
| and barren rocky hills hour after
j hour are enough to make one want j
jto join the California Chamber of ;
Commerce; which is not saying j
j much for the Great American
! Desert.
j . j
Having nothing better to do, Rog- !
| ers and I passed the time preparing j
I "impromptu" remarks for a Friday :
j night appearance at an Ogden the- ;
latre. For the first 200 miles Rogers
refused to respond to a single one |
;of my gags. But when I countered j
I with a "laugh strike" on the Rogers j
! brand of humor, he finally came to
| terms. Wc arrived in Ogden in a
j state of hilarious reciprocity.
j Ogden (45,000 souls) is the second
| largest city in Utah. Paly could give j
i Ogden a good run for its money, ex- j
jcept that Ogden has a brewery, and '<
i it is patriotic to guzzle. Our wel
i come at the theatre was friendly
| enough. We were sandwiched in be
' tween "Chu Chin Chow" and a fa- ,
shion show, with time enough to say
| only 12 words apiece. Which means !
| that our laboriously prepared "im- :
| promptu" remarks will be warmed
i over for the Pocatello, Idaho, Ki
j wanis Club. Lucky for them! j
■
Manager Gros hustled us down to |
Salt Lake, where our dear friends
of last November were much per- !
turbed at our labeling them "Sin
less" in a previous column. Which .
proves that the one thing worse than
i telling a person he lacks a sense of
! humor is to accuse him of being vir- i
! luous. The Devil has prudery on the
\ run.
I '
j Salt Lake (so the natives say) has '
! been basking in wonderfully mild
j winter weather. The day after we ar
rived a small blizzard coated the
streets, the hills, and the Mormon
! Temple with snow. "Unusual," say
; Ihe Salt Lakers, a bit sheepishly. But
! it is crisp and beautiful, nothing to
be ashamed of.
Tomorrow we debate Ogden on
l the "Arms and Munitions" question.
Our opponents are two Mormon mis
sionaries, just returned from con
verting the heathen. Fortunately,
(his is a non-decision contest.

SALT LAKE CITY, Feb. 24—It
I is about 800 miles across the Great !
1 American Desert from Sun Fran- j
Cisco to Salt Lake. If you like sage j
brash and .sheep, the Great Amer- 1
; ican Desert is all right. But sage j
brush and sheep are much more j
I beautiful in a Zane Grey novel than 1
' through the window of a railroad
I train. Dust, dirty little shanties, 1
| and barren rocky hills hour after
j hour are enough to make one want j
jto join the California Chamber of ;
Commerce; which is not saying j
j much for the Great American
! Desert.

| ers and I passed the time preparing j
I "impromptu" remarks for a Friday :
j night appearance at an Ogden the- ;
latre. For the first 200 miles Rogers
refused to respond to a single one |
;of my gags. But when I countered j
I with a "laugh strike" on the Rogers j
! brand of humor, he finally came to
| terms. Wc arrived in Ogden in a
j state of hilarious reciprocity.
j Ogden (45,000 souls) is the second

i Ogden a good run for its money, ex- j
jcept that Ogden has a brewery, and '<
i it is patriotic to guzzle. Our wel
i come at the theatre was friendly
| enough. We were sandwiched in be
' tween "Chu Chin Chow" and a fa- ,
shion show, with time enough to say
| only 12 words apiece. Which means !
| that our laboriously prepared "im- :
| promptu" remarks will be warmed
i over for the Pocatello, Idaho, Ki
