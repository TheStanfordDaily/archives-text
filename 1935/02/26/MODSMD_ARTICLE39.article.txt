# Student Reactions Enjoyed by Town Movie Audiences
## 
### 
Since the nickleodion days,
Stanford .students have carried
their own movie sound effects
in the form of hisses, boos and
claps, and believe it or not,
adult movie-goers still like a
little home-grown racket mixed
in with the dulcet tones of their
favorite stars.
"Many of our patrons like the
noise made by campusites,"
George Teckmeyer, manager of
the Stanford Theatre, admitted
today, "although it does detract
from the film."
The background noise of 1935,
however, is but a whisper of
its former self, theatre records
reveal. Booing has decreased 75
per cent in the last three years,
attributed by Teckmeyer to
more serious collegiate at
titude, and to the fact that bet
ter pictures are being pro
duced.
