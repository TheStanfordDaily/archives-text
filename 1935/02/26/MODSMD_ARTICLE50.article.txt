## WHY NOT A CLOCK FOR ANGELL FIELD? 
### 
In no major sport does time play a
more vital part than in track. Points
still determine the winner, as they do 1
in football and baseball and basket- j
ball, but the basis for comparing j
track athletes and the center of in- 1
terest for real tans of track and field
is the ti"ie made: a first in the 100-
yard dash doesn't get a second ;
thought, in most cases, unless the j
time is fast.
Especially in Stanford track,
with its emphasis on a few great
performers, such as the famed !
"Seven Avengers" of last year, j
does the interest lie in the times
made rather than first, second and
third places. Again this year Dink
Tcmpleton will have a nucleus of
a few stellar performers, running
against themselves, against time,
rather than only for a place.
The reason why people who get j
a kick out of football or baseball I
feel bored at a track meet is because j
they have no means of appreciating
the time made. If the followers of |
Farm sports understood that Warren
Dixon will be pushing Chuck Nimmo
in the mile all season and that the j
latter is a cinch to break 4 minutes j
20 seconds before long, and that Skin !
Wilson's 21-year-old Big Meet rec- !
ord is 4:20.2, Angell Field crowds 1
would be larger this year.
So why not an electric clock on j
Angell Field? We have clocks for J
football and basketball, and they are :
' of much more extensive service in j
, t rack.
. Placed in front of the bleachers, a
I band ticking off the seconds would'
: relieve a lot of the neck craning j
j down the 220 straighl-away, and \
i would lessen the "Sit down!" and '
"Down in front" hue and cry that !
follows the start of every dash and |
hurdle race. When A1 Blackmail and
Ben Eastman start ihe 440-yard dash j
in the all-University meet, people in \
1 the stands can figure ih.it they ought
to whip by when the clock reaches ,
23:5 seconds if they're going to break j
: 47 Hat.
A good miler will run his laps in ■
certain speeds, completing the first
half in 2 minutes and 10 seconds, for |
j example. If, by means of a clock, the
1 fans can enter into this fascinating
•competition in pace judgment and.
timing, the mile and the 2-mile will |
; be more than the spectacle of men j
running themselves out, which
| causes unnecessary and distracting
; sympathy.
Clocks suitable for track pur
poses are used in the East, and the
! Stanford truk interest would
benefit by one. Perhaps Skull and
Snakes will see (bat one is here
for their all-University IC4-A
; benefit meet.

In no major sport does time play a

still determine the winner, as they do 1
in football and baseball and basket- j
ball, but the basis for comparing j
track athletes and the center of in- 1
terest for real tans of track and field
is the ti"ie made: a first in the 100-
yard dash doesn't get a second ;
thought, in most cases, unless the j
time is fast.
Especially in Stanford track,
with its emphasis on a few great
performers, such as the famed !
"Seven Avengers" of last year, j
does the interest lie in the times
made rather than first, second and
third places. Again this year Dink
Tcmpleton will have a nucleus of
a few stellar performers, running
against themselves, against time,
rather than only for a place.
The reason why people who get j
a kick out of football or baseball I
feel bored at a track meet is because j
they have no means of appreciating
the time made. If the followers of |
Farm sports understood that Warren
Dixon will be pushing Chuck Nimmo
in the mile all season and that the j
latter is a cinch to break 4 minutes j
20 seconds before long, and that Skin !
Wilson's 21-year-old Big Meet rec- !
ord is 4:20.2, Angell Field crowds 1
would be larger this year.
So why not an electric clock on j
Angell Field? We have clocks for J
football and basketball, and they are :

I band ticking off the seconds would'

j down the 220 straighl-away, and \
i would lessen the "Sit down!" and '
"Down in front" hue and cry that !
follows the start of every dash and |
hurdle race. When A1 Blackmail and
Ben Eastman start ihe 440-yard dash j
in the all-University meet, people in \
1 the stands can figure ih.it they ought
to whip by when the clock reaches ,
23:5 seconds if they're going to break j
