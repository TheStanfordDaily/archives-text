# BEFORE TWO STRAIGHT CONFERENCE WINS
## 
### 
Last week in this column I took a
crack at the metropolitan sport writ
ers for their ironic attitude towards
j Stanford basketball, arid quoted sev
eral of the stories following the up
! set of the Bears ten days ago. At
that time 1 hadn't run across this
gem, easily the prize-winner: '"I
I haven't been down to the Stanford
today," writes one of the S. F. scribes
in a signed story, "to see if the bas
ketball Pavilion is still standing, but
if it is, I am sure one good gust of
i wind will blow it over. Coach John
Bunn's Indian cagers finally did
right by the old hall, and the Board
of Athletic Control should have an
inscription carved in the wall that
on February 1(5, 1935, a Stanford bas
-5 ketball team won from California by
| a score of 38 to 34."
There's the big reason why the
' Cardinal quintet is going out to take
another game from the Bears this
Saturday night. Two weeks ago they
said they would defeat California
j twice and the Bruins twice, and no
body believed it. They've made good
on three-fourths of the boast, and a
win Saturday would go a long ways
toward dispelling the pessimism that
; weighs down on Farm basketball.
