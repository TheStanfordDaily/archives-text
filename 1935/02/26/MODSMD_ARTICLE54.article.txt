# Frosh Coach Pins Hopes On Two Men for Opener
## 
### GORDY FROST 
On the shoulders of two men will j
rest the outcome of the Stanford
frosh track team's fust meet of the
season Saturday with San Mateo
J.C. So said Coach Bill Ellington last
night.
According to Ellington, San Mateo ;
has a strong squad this year and j
should take a good half of the events
as well as a substantial stock of sec
onds and thirds. Stanford's hope lies |
in the showings of Jim Kneubuhl i
running the sprints* and Hank Lui
setti in the high jump.
Ineligibilities have dragged down
Stanford's chances for seconds
and thirds. Although no out
standing performers have been
ordered off the track, eight prom
ising cinder pounders have heard
the call of studies.
If Kneubuhl, the only top-notch
sprinter on the squad, can take a
first in his event, chances for a win
will rise. Hank Luisetti. only high
jump hope, turned out for the first
time yesterday, having been occu
pied with basketball all season. San
Mateo's jumper, Dewint Good, does
a consistent 5 foot 10 inches but Lui
setti's previous prep school show
ings indicaliJ that he may be able to
take the event.
Ellington is hoping to take first and

j second in the hurdles with Ken Pe- |
(ers and Cy Oberg doing the run
ning.
Two-miler Etson Burroughs, who
turned in the fast time of 9:52.8 hist
Friday, will probably take the eight
lap event and Glenn Hamilton
should take the discus and perhaps 1
the shot.
