## 
### 
U.C.L.A.'s surprise 7-6 victory
over the Stanford rugby team Sat
urday throws a wrench into the
works, as far as the Cards are con
cerned. To win the conference cham
pionship and the right to go north
to play the British Columbia Reps,
the Card fifteen must beat Cul Sat
urday and then beat them again in a
return match.
The Bears lead tho league now,
with no defeats. Stanford has one
defeat, U.C.L.A. one, (and U.S.C. two.
Thus Troy is eliminated, and U.C.
L.A. cannot make th,.- northern trip,
as they get no spring vacation. The
decision lies between the two Big
Game rivals.
If the Cards win over the Bears
Saturday, they go into a tie for the
I lead, and the winner will be deter
mined from a playoff on March
| Coaeh Ed Graff's Bears flashed
plenty of power last week-end in
i trouncing the strong fifteen from the
j U. of S.F. On several occasions they
1 sprang fast men into the clear for
: long scoring plays.
Card locker-room talk today
j voiced the opinion that the conver
i sion kick of Ray Lewis, which would
| have won the game, was actually
j good, although the referee called it
! no good. It could be seen from the
! bench that the ball at one time
j sailed between the goal posts, al
i though the strong prevailing wind
i blew it foul as it hit the ground.
Coach Harry Maloney, in anticipa
