# CARD MERMEN TO FACE U.C. IN MEET SATURDAY
## 
### HERB DIAMOND 
Stanford's Big Meet in swimming '
with California scheduled for next
' Saturday afternoon at Berkeley
looms as th. closest match between
the Card mermen and the Bears
since 1917, when the U.C. men last
downed the Indian fortes.
Since 1917 the Indians have piled
uy a long string of unbroken vic
tories in the Big Meet. For many
years it was a big day for Cal when
even one of their men placed. In j
. 1933, however, California built its j
new pools, secured the services of j
A1 Dowden as coach, and the Bear j
swimmers accordingly began to I
show a great deal of improvement.
Today they are an even, or slightly
better than even, choice to defeat'
, the Indians.
Cal Now Powerful
N xt Saturday Coaeh Nort Thorn
ton'.-: squad will tangle with the most
powerful team in Cal's history. Led
by Captain Bill Johnson, breast
stroke ace, and Ed Davis, all-Amer-
I i: an sprint selection of last year, the
Bears present a well-rounded squad.
We Id on Smith, who swims the 100
and 220-yard free styles and the
relay, is the iron man of the Cal
1 outfit. Roy Siems is the Bears' star
backstroker. Danny Kuhns, North
ern California diving champ, is one
of the coast's best. Jack Dozier, an
! other Berkeley star, will be hard to
beat in the quarter-mile.
Foster Only Real Star
i Stanford, according to Coach
| Thornton, has a relatively weak
team. The Indians, who once domi

| natect the all-American ranks, have
only one man of national caliber. In
Captain Bob Foster the Cards have
one of the nation's greatest breast
stroke kings. Undoubtedly one of
the most stellar sailor style swim
mers the coast has ever known,
Fosttr has never been beaten at the
200-yaid intercollegiate distance.
The Stanford eaptain, Pacific Coast
â€¢hamp, holds the American record
|in tru 10; Pacific Association honors
I in the 220; and Pacific Coast Inter
| eollegiate mark in the 200. All ol
i these marks are in danger of being
j shattered again this year as the Card
captain swims the 200 against Cal.
and the 220 a week later at the
Northern California championships
at Oakland.
