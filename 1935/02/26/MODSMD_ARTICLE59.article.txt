# FATHER OF NATION LAUDED BY BAILEY IN RADIO LECTURE
## Speaker Stresses Strength Of Leader's Character 
### 
"George Washington was neither
the God that Parson Weems mad'.'
him, nor the: simpleton the debunker
tried to make him. Muck lackers
come to seofT, and remain to wor
ship."
Thus Dr. Thomas A. Bailey, popu
lar professor of history, gave his
radio audienee a picture of the true
Washington over s'ation KGO at 8
o'clock last night. His message on
"The Secret of Washington's Great
ness" Wili > delivered with intelli
gence, force, and humor.
Surrounded by Halo
Bailey declared that American
school children think of the first
president as the perfect person of
virtue that they are told he is. His
real claim to greatness—a human
being overcoming human passions,
as well as great external obstacles—
is lost in the suffocating net of mock
heroic and namby-pamby stories
that surround the school child. As
he grows older and more intelligent
he sometimes turns into the profes
sional debunker who takes his re
venge by giving the "Father of Our
Country" all the human frailties.
Washington was a leader, a man
among men, possessing enormous
physical strength, but the real sec
ret of his success, in Bailey's opin
ion, was his enormous strength of
character; the speaker quoted a fa
mous painter who remarked that the
lines of Washington's face indicated
tremendous passions held in check
by enormous power of will.
Devoted to Service
"To my mind," said Bailey, "the
real lest of Washington's greatness i.-.
not so much what he actually ac
complished as what he put up with
at the hands of his contemporaries."
Himself a man of wealth and posi
tion, hi' devoted himself to the serv
ice of his countrymen and raised the
standard of rebellion against the
mightiest empire in the world,
simply because American liberty
was dear to him. "Washington was
pro-American, not pro-French, nor
pro-English."
The first American inspired Kip
ling's immortal lines: "li you can
keep your head when all about you
are losing theirs and blaming it on
you . .
