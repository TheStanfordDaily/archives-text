Does the average American have
any conception at all ot the condi
tions now existing in China and the
Far East? "No," says Rrlph Town
send, former American consul oflicer
in China, now teaching in the jour
nalism department at Stanford Uni
versity.
"Americans," Townsend points
out, "do not get any of the truth
about China because most of the
people who know the truth are not
in a position to tell the actual facts.
Peace Menace Feared
"One thing you can t go wrong in
emphasizing. That is that America's
present anti-Japane.se baiting cam
paign is viewed by thoughtful per
sons resident in the Far East a.-, a
very serious menace to peace.
"Nothing in the particulars of the
case as it is seen by well-informed

persons warrants our taking sides
one way or the other in difficulties
between the Chinese and Japanese.
Our hostility to Japan is unjustified
and our maudlin sentimentality foi
China is ridiculous.
Rumors Unfounded
"Americans re.,idem in the Far
East do not share the anti-Japanese
spirit apparent here. They do not see
evidence of Japanese designs upon
us. Not a shred of substantiated evi
dence has ever come to light to jus
tify current rumors here.
"As for our assisting China, that is '
next to impossible under prest nt
conditions, because only a minority
of the officials in China are in a sta
tus entitling them to represent the
population of China. Loans to China
go into the pockets of military rack
eteers.
