# Second Photolith Section Appears In Daily Today
## 
### 
Because the Ex Committee
Ins given The Daily the much
discussed 15 cents over the
former allotment per student,
the second photolith section of
The Daily is appearing today.
Charlotte Burridge, women's
editor of The Daily, has had
charge of the editing of the
second edition as well as the
first. Cuts of student life have
been loaned by the Quad for
the section which was printed
by the new photolith process of
the University Press.
The last issue, which was sent
to 5000 alumni, met with cam
pus approval, arousing interest
in further pictorial sections.
Additional copies of today's
photolith paper may be ob
tained from the Stanford Daily
Business Office.
