# CHANGES CITED IN PRESIDENT'S ANNUAL REPORT
## Wilbur Tells of Extension Of Independent Study In Upper Division 
### 
j Independent study has developed
| to a new height during the 1933-34
; period, particularly in the extension
' of independent study to junior stu
j dents. Plans for juniors engaged in
j independent study are entirely difâ€”
I ferent, however, from those for
merly existing in the upper division
of the University Independent Study.
I)r. Ray Lyman Wilbur stated in
his preface to the Annual Report
| issued Monday, "It is not antici-
J pated th-vt the group of upper di-
I vision students working on indc
j pendent programs will be very
i large, for under the present schol
| arship requirements of the Uni
i versity, there are scarcely 50 jun-
I iors and 50 seniors in social sci
j ences and English who have dem
onstrated ability to meet the
standard set for independent
students."
Dr. Wilbur further emphasized
I the independent study plan, stating
] that the possibilities of achievement
I of the lower division students have
j been d continuous gratification to
j those interested in furthering the
I plan after its three years of success-
I ful trial.
Enrollment Increases
The report shows that there has
| been a decided increase in enroll
i ment during the past year, due
I largely to the increased quota of
j women. The total number of stu
i dents registered for the year 1933-34
j was 3975, an increase of 117 over last
j year. There was also an increase of
289 in the number of new students.
I An increase of 18,906 new books
j have been added to the University
I Library, largely through gifts and
j exchanges. The Hoover War Library
i has received many new pamphlets
and books from individuals and
countries all over the world.
Reports Scholarship
i George Culver, dean of men, in
: his section of the Annual Report,
j showed that there was a slight bet
j terment in the scholastic averages
jof the larger men's living groups.
I Branner Hall led with the highest
j average in scholarship ratios.
"The financial status of the fra
ternities on the campus is better than
any similar group in the larger uni
versities because of the effieieht au
diting system provided by the Inter
j fraternity Board, and new economy
i methods introduced through the
j house managers and the Stanford
i Commissary," stated Culver.
