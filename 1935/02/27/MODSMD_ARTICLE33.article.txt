# A 						Campus Doctor Needed For the Women's Rest Home
## 
### 
IJoth the Men's and Women's Rest Home
services do veoinan duly on the campus. Kacli
year they are responsible for taking care of
many hundreds ol campus students who are
ill bill nol ill enough to f4<) to the hospital. The
charge is nominal and the service on the whole
is very satisfactory.
However, in the case of the Women's Rest
Home, a delect exists which works a hardship
on the women who are quartered there lor a
few days. In past years, a regular doctor from
the I niversity visited the Women's Rest Home
regularly.
This service has been discontinued, and
women who are in the rest home and require
medical attention must get it from Palo Alto.
Doctors engaged in private practice must be
called in, and the medical service thus ren
dered is entirely disassociated from the regu
lar I niversity health service.
The doctors in Palo Alto have an agreement
whereby there is no charge made for a first
c:i11 to the rest home. However, w hen more
than one call is made, there is the regulation
doctor's fee, and if the patient is seriously ill,
or needs more than one visit, the fee soon
rises in proportion.
Although a qualified nurse is in service at
the rest home, this is not adequate to fulfill
the need when the hospital may be over
crowded, and the rest home taxed with people
who may be more than slightly ill and need
the attentions of a doctor, for which they may
be unable to pay.
It would be a worth-while investment, and
;i safeguard to campus women, to have some
arrangement whereb\ a physician connected
with the I niversity might make a call at the
Women's Rest Home daily. I! would lake the
financial burden from many who can ill all'ord
lo pay doctors' fees, and at the same time
lighten the burden of the medical stall' at the
women's gym, who must treat many cases
each day.
