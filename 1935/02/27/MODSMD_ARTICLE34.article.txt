The passing of "tho rah-rah hoy of yester
day" from American colleges and universities
was proclaimed the other day hy the (arnogic
Foundation in its twenty-ninth report of the
higher educational scene. To Stanford such
news was not startling, for the Farm lias hoen
watching the gradual decline of the country
rlul) era of I he last decade's easy-going hoom
oays.
The coining of tin 1 depression was the out
standing cause for this change in campus
life. It was the scarcity of money, the somher
ncss of the city, the timidity of business that
made the "rah-rah" hoy think about things
about what he was going to do when he got
out of college, about possible sources of in
come. about the uncertainly of his position in
college.
The movies of campus life, although exag
gerated, brought home to the student the
childishness, the high school aspect of rah
rahisin.
As the report announced, the college man
"is no longer the blase, sophisticated student
of the twenties, lie is a hard-working, serious
minded person who demands more of the
college library, the laboratory, and the in
structor than did his brother of a decade ago.
. . . He has a different attitude toward scholar
ship, research, athletics, fraternities. ;md stu
dent activities.
"It is a fact that every serious-minded ex
periment on the part of educational institu
tions to attain a new level of educational ef
fectiveness is now being met by the students
with serious-minded and intelligent co-opera
tion."
Thus "Joe College" passes down Ihe road
to distant oblivion, along with the Stanford
Hough and cords.
