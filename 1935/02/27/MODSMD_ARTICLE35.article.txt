# Japan's "Spy Game"
## 
### 
Kver-vary Japan, traditionally suspicious
p| foreigners, carries on her comic-opera war
114:1 invt ; 111»-14<• 11 spies by detaining the crew of
he I'nited States tanker Kli/;d>eth
ind succeeds only in making \inericans luis
lr and others laugh at her cautious unties.

11 is foolish to suppose thai, should the
I nited States wish information ahwtil Nip
pon's precious forts, she would attempt to
secure it by any means which would he so
sure o! detection as to strand an American
tanker on a Tokyo Hay sand liar for .~»«S hours.
Americans, of course, can have no com
plaint on the essential nature of the proced-
because Japanese have been arrested and
deported from this country for espionage
quite consistently in recent years. Whether or
not the work such Japanese carry on here is
t«>r their government is still a question; but
the fact remains that those who were caught
were obviously information by means
ol paper and film about our defenses.
Japan, however, is a bit irked at the con
stant detection of her nationals who wander
about the I nited States with pencil and cam
era.
As an example of what the intelligent spy
does not do, there is the sad case of the little
.Japanese who was deported alter he was dis
covered taking soundings of San Dietfo Bay
from a rowhoat with a length ol fishline. Had
the i nquisi t ive "spy" used a little intelligence,
he would merely have written the Bureau of
Navigation for an accurate and ollicial chart
ol the harbor, obtainable for perhaps twenty
cents.
II appears that Japan merely wishes to re
taliate for these most embarrassing American
arrests. She will hold another "investigation"
and question the tanker's crew with a show
of .ureal ceremony and injured pride. The
incident will then be closed, and Japan's very
touchy national jealousy will he once more
appeased.
