## WITH ARTHUR MARTIN CATHCART 
### CEDRIC LARSON 
Professor Arthur IVI. Cathcart of the Stanford Law
School believes that the rulings handed down by
America's highest judicial tribunal last week in an
18.000-word decision in the gold clause decisions are of
great constitutional importance for two reasons:
First, the Supreme Court verdict determines that
Congress has power to decide what shall be legal
tender in payment of all debts other than those of
the federal government regardless of the will of the
parties, even though that will be expressed in previous
contracts.
Second, the decision held that Congress cannot
annul a contract obligation of the United Slates.
"As to the first point—obligations other than those
of the United States," states Professor Cathcart, "not
withstanding counsel's argument that gold clauses
generally amounted to a contract to pay in bullion and
hence did not create a debt to which legal tender legis
lation could apply, the court reached the very sensible
conclusion that the clause meant what it said. It. was a
promise to pay in coin of a specified weight and fine
ness. the purpose being to guard against devaluation
of the dollar or a depreciated currency.
"The question then is not what the gold clause
means, but is rather what the effect of the joint
resolution of Congress (of June 5, 1933 wherein
United States went off the gold standard) upon it.
Congress has the constitutional sovereign power
of determining wirt shall he legal tender in the
payment of all debts.
"The very he/ut of the decision is contained in
Chief Justice Hughes pronouncement: "Contracts,
however express, cannot fetter the constitutional
authority of Congress. Contracts may create rights
of property, hut when contracts deal with a subject
matter which lies within the control of Congress
they have a congenital infirmity.' The argument, is,
I think, entirely sound.
"Regarding the second point—obligations between
the United States and individuals," explains the law
professor, "having reached the conclusion that the
obligation of the Liberty Bond to pay gold remained,
the court then addressed itself to the question as to
whether the plaintiff could show any damage, and held
that no damage had been shown and that presumably
none could be shown.
"This position was apparently based on the ground
that in the case Perry, the plaintiff, got the promised
gold, he could make no lawful use of it except by sur
rendering it to the government at the price fixed
under the authority of the Anti-Hoarding Act. This
reasoning is to me unconvincing as Perry could make
very good use of the equivalent in legal tender currency.
"However, even if the court should be wrong in
its ■•rguinent based upon tlie assumed non-exist
ence of damage, the error would be of little more
than academic interest and for this reason: If
Congress wants to pay in accordance with the
terms of the bonds it may do so; but if it does
not wish to pay there is no way to compel it to do so.
"In the first place a sovereign power cannot be sued
without its consent, and unable to extinguish the obli
gation, Congress could make it impossible to enforce
the obligation by denying jurisdiction over the subject
matter to the Court of Claims.
"In the second place," concludes Professor Cathcart,
"even if a judgment were obtained by plaintiff in
the Court of Claims, Congress could refuse to make
an appropriation with which to pay off the judgment."
