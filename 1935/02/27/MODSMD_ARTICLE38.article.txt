# CAMPUS OPINION
## CURIOSITY VS. IDEALS

The Editor, Sir:
Regarding "Campus Opinion" col
umn, Daily. Feb. 25. Miss Cynthia
Hill's worthy outbreak of righteous
wrath quile amused me. "Why teal
down the beautiful ideals and char
acteristics which we have always
j connected with our first President?"
! she asks.
Weil, facts are facts, and ideals are
ideals. Personally, I would rather
have facts. It's fun to be fooled, but
it's more fun to know. Some people
like to be fooled; to this 1 have noth
ing to say. Why did Miss Hill read
the article through if she wished her
beautiful ideals to remain unsullied
| by such brass debunking? It must
! have been curiosity, and curiosity
j is about the worst enemy of ideals
one can find. Not only did she read
1 the article, but she ui ;o wrote in, as
I am doing now -but 1 am ever
| urged on by curiosity and other un
worthy motives.
The Washington described by Pro
j lessor Bailey, proverbially a fact
seeker, is a much more human and
likeable person than any saint. And
1 do not think that Mr. McClelland's
picture represents Washington as a
j shallow creature. Nor do I believe
that a great man must necessarily
believe in God. True, most past
1 greats have, but so have most all
: people.
Another thing. Mis'- Hill hints that
jan atheist considers himself "Mr.
God," and that he is very conceited.
1 have not found that to be the case
usually. Many atheists are more or
less pessimistic and don't even con
| sider man to be much shucks. They
don't believe that they are specimens
of Homo Sapiens, Man the Wise
Creature, but rather specimens of
Homo Sapiens. Man the Saphead.
