# HAS BRIDGES MIXED
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
In reading this otherwise excel
lent article by Dave Mellinkoff, I am
led to believe that at the time of
writing he was either a little too
concerned about not bothering the
man behind the newspaper, or .he
victim of a common misunderstand
ing.
Persons familiar with the now
prominent bridge building activities
of the San Francisco Bay region
know that it is not the Bay Bridge,
but Golden Gate Bridge which has
occasioned so much controversy.
Professor Willis maintains that a
| fault lies under the foundation of
the south tower of the Golden Gate
Bridge, out on the tip of Fort Point.
The Bay Bridge, which crosses to
Oakland via Yerba Buena Island, is
a distinctly different contract, and is
as safe as the ole hump of Gibraltar.
