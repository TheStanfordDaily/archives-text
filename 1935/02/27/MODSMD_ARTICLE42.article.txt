•OLD RELIABLES"
One result of the Legion of De
cency campaign against the cinema
has been a "back to the classics'
movement among the various pro
ducers.
In the search for sure-fire screen
material, someone bethought himself
of the literary loves of his youth —
those sugary epics of the Elsie Dins
mores and the Little Women.
With tongue in cheek they fed a
sophisticated audience great gobs of
saccharine sentimentality and prayed
i that the results would not be as
j bad as the Legion-threatened box
office boycott.
' No pne was more surprised than
the Hollywood producers at the suc
cess of "Little Women." That started
a wave of imitation, as a successful
pictui'e always does. Some other pro
duction expert rediscovered Dickers
(despite the fact that millions of
readers had never lost him), and the
public was deluged with a veritable
flood of Dickens pictures—"Great
Expectations," "David Copperfield,"
and "The Mystery of Edwin Drood."
Still another company decided to
delete the sweetness and go in for
adventure, but again with the clas
sics in mind. The result was a pon
derous and dull version of "The
Count of Monte Cristo," one of the
I greatest adventure novels ever
written.
The chief difficulty with the '"back
i to the classics" movement in the
movies has been the choice of clas
sics to film. In ihe hope of finding a
ready-made audience, the producers
have chosen novels familiar to all. As
a result, they have been faced with
the problem of producing a good
; motion picture that at the same time
j satisfies those who love the original
I novel and would resent any change
; in it.
! It must be obvious that the novel
and the motion picture are greatly
different forms and must treat their
material differently. It is impossible
to translate from one medium to the

other and retain the same charac
teristics in the second as in the
original.
Literature presents a good field
for the motion picture. The produc
ers would do well to choose less ia
miliar books ;is their raw material
(•for translation to the screen, for they
may then taki greater liberties with
it and turn out a better motion
picture.
Two novels which offer excellent
possibilities for the screen are Vic
tor Hugo's "Ninety-three" and Conan
Doyle's "Maracot Deep." The former
is an exciting, "blood and thunder
story of the French Revolution,
while the latter, a contemporary
novel, is an imaginative tale of the
lost continent, Atlantis.
But no matter what authors are
chosen, let us have motion pictures,

(
not photographic novel.
