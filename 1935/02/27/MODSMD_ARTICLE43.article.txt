MOKE HOOP TIIOI'HEE
IN THE OFFING.

Excepting the Bear-Indian clash
in Berkeley for the second place po
sition this Saturday night, interest
in coast conference basketball now
centers on the old feud between the
advocates of the rough and of the
.skilliul types of the game.
'Ihe row of Calilornia versus
Stanford, U.C.L.A., and U.S C.
over how the game ol basketball
is to l>e played ir<s become in
creasingly obvious during the past
(wo weeks. After the lust Cali
lornia-Stanford meeting ten days
ago, which was won by the In
dians. both coaches were agreed
that the game was terrible, but for
opposite reasons.
Nibs Price of the Bears was in
dignant at the referees for calling so
many fouls. "We can't have basket
ball if officials are going to call a
foul every time one man touches
another."
John Bunn of the Farm protested
for opposite reasons: '"When you've
got players falling'all over the court,
and depending on the roughness to
get them by, it's not the real game,"
Obviously, the differences are fun
damental, involving the type of game
that basketball is, either one of skill
and speed, as Bunn maintains, or one
including power and bodily contact,
as Price coaches it.

BEARS MAKE
LONE STAND

Disregarding the origin of bas
ketball and ihe way in which it is
played in other sections of the coun
try, the other three teams of the
southern division of the coast con
ference are apparently set on the
speed and .skill game, against Cali
fornia. U.C.L.A.'s Daily Bruin made
the crack that after watching four
California-Bruin games, the writer
couldn't understand why "Price
didn't make a success as a football
coach."
The Trojans, as shown by the
type of game they play against
Stanford and U.C.L.A., arc coached
in the speed-skill style, though
they have size and strength on the
squad to match California's rough
ness when necessary.
Despite the loneness of their po
sition, Price and the California five
are determined that bodily contact
belongs in basketball. When "Soft
hall" Bunn, as the Daily Californian
put it, takes his Indian quintet to
Berkeley this Saturday night, more
may become of the squabble than
the protesting shouts of the two
coaches that were frequently heard
above the din of the last California-
Stanford game.

MORE INJURIES
FOR TOPPING

Wonder ii Old Man Injury that has
chased Keith Topping through the i
last two basketball seasons has fi- i
nallv caught up with the rugged In- ;
dian center for good? Last year a i
broken nose put "Tops" off the hard- i
wood just before the important series i
with the Trojans.
This yesr it's been football in
juries, including a badly bruised
knee; then a slashed forearm, neces
sitating a dozen stitches; thirdly, a
badly infected hand, just before the i
first Bruin series; and finally the !
back injury, received while shooting
buckets last Thursday and involving
the muscles surrounding the ver- j
tebra, which ruined his play last r
weekend.
Topping couldn't jump or bend
over Friday night, and, unless elec
tric pad treatments suddenly become !
effective, will not be able to prac
tice this week. But "Tops" would
like to get into his last California-
Stanford basketball game and a rug
ged center would mean a lot to the
Cards Saturday night, so the hard
luck man of Stanford basketball may
be on the floor after all, injuries or
no injuries.
