## 
### 
Amassing 709 points to 425 for
their opponents and losing only two
games in 17, Stanford frosh basket
ball team can look back on a highly
successful season.
Hank Luisetti, whose spectacular
I inlaying at forward has won him
much praise, easily carried high
scoring honors by tallying 305 points
or an average of 18 digits per game.
' Second place went to reliable guard
Nelly Heath with a total of 87 points,
third to Dick Lyon with 84.
Bob Zonne, who was forced to
J leave his center position in nwd
j season due to ill health, was promi
nent with GO points for eight games.
H. B. Lee, first string guard, al-
I though not a high scorer, earned
j recognition for himself with his fast
recoveries from the backboard and
i flashy floor play.
Coach Jimmy Bradshaw's hoop
i men staged an unconvincing start

j of their season by barely nosing out
Sacramento High School 31-30. Then
came a series of substantial wins
which climaxed when, in one week
end, they defeated Galileo High
School 70-16 and Santa Clara frosh
73-24. In the latter game Luisetti
hit his best pace to score 34 points.
I Clarence Maurer, forward, also
i shined in the Santa Clara bout by
tallying 24 digits.
Two weeks later the frosh went
down to their first defeat of the sea
, son at the hands of U.S.F. frosh,
; 30â€”28. Luisetti was lowest in his
| scoring at this point, making only 6
tallies. Another setback came when
California frosh, coming back after
ihe Stanford yearlings had trounced
them once, gave the papooses their
second loss to make the game score
even.
Against a strong unbeaten St
Mary's team the Stanford frosh
came back after their slump to win
handily, 37-25. Since that time the
Cards have downed San Mateo J. C.,
Piedmont High School and South
San Francisco High to finish off their
season in good shape.
