# BEAR RUGGERS UNBEATEN; FAVORED OVER CARDINALS
## 
### 
Entering (heir first game this sea- .
! son as "underdogs," Coach Jim
Wylie's Redskin rugby men will take
on Coach Ed Graff's California lifâ€”
j teen here in the stadium Saturday.
The Bears are favored because I
| they beat U.C.L.A. and Stanford
| didn t. Card players, however, have i
j their own ideas about Cal, and their
j undefeated standing. They have both
I eyes on the trip north to meet the
j Canadian Reps over the spring
' vacation.
Cal's Fall Scrum
Uclan ruggers last week confided I
j after the game that Cal had a tall !
| and strong forward wall, which was I

adept at grabbing the ball from a
lineout and thereby gaining posses
sion of the offense.
Lineup Shifts
Yesterday afternoon it was hinted
that Ray Lewis, now playing
fullback, would be shifted to second
five-eighths. This would necessi
tate the moving of Frank Alustiza,
probably to first five, and the re
"ention of Bob Mondavi at the full
back position.
Another interesting game will be I
played as preliminary, the Card and 1
Bear second teams meeting. Both
are undefeated. The Bear seconds I
thumped U.S.F.'s reserves Saturday, '
9-0.
