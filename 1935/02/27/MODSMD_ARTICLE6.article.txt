# PHILLIPS SAYS CHANGE NEEDED
## 'Capitalists Aid Growth Of Communistic Ideas' 
### 
Emphasizing the fact that social
change is the nature of the day
throughout the world. Dean Hubert
Phillips of Fresno State College
spoke last night in the Assembly Hall
on "The Road Ahead: Capitalism,
Fascism, Socialism, Communism."
"A new order is in the making, and
it must be built by those who look
both ways," said Dr. Phillips. "Yet
while we must be patient in build
ing, we must also be bold. Our col
leges and universities must guaran
tee the right to fiee inquiry."
"Fascist philosophy is marching on
in Europe, but there is one factor
present in England, France, and
America that may save us. There is
a fundamental tradition of liberty.
If it were not there I would be pes
simistic regarding domestic institu
tions."
Speaking of the threat of Commu
nism in the United States, Dr. Phil
lips said that while the Communists
unknowingly alienate middle class
opinion by their actions and publi
cations, the capitalists themselves
decidedly help promote the growth
of Communism by their practice of
paying less than a living wage.
He said, "Such instances have done
more to create a psychological con
dition in which subversive senti
ments could be planted and flourish,
than all the Communist speeches
ever made and all the Communist
literature ever printed."
