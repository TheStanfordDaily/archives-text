# Hamilton Plans Business Career; 'No Pro Football'
## 
### John McClelland 
"Some cock-eyed room-mate I
had at prep school started calling
me 'Ham'—l suppose because my
name is Hamilton. That evolved into
'Hambone' and finally into 'Bones'."
That's the way Bob "Bones" Ham
ilton reluctantly explains away the
moniker that Stanford, his team
mates and the world of football
knows him by. But he's used to his
skeleton-like name now, Bones says.
In fact when he ran for a B.A.C.
post in the last election they had his
name on the ballot as "Bob Hamil
ton" and more than a few student
voters didn't know wh*> it was.
Since the frosh foot bail season of
1932, Bones has been known to Stan
ford first and last as an athlete. He
is the rather diminutive half-back
who put the last big game on ice for
the Indians. And he is the man who
was awarded the Douglas Fairbanks
trophy last fall as a result of foot
ball players all over the country
voting him "the most valuable play
er of the season." Bones was given a
rating of 96.41 by the men who
played against him—the highest of
scores given to hundreds of gridders
in a nation-wide vote.
"Football is the best sport," Ham
ilton says, "but baseball is a mighty
fine game, too." The latter keeps
Bones in the sport-light the year
around, for as soon as the grid sea
son is over he is out taking direc
tions from Baseball Coach Harry
Walters who right now depends a
lot on him to keep the Card team
from going below the mediocre.
Bones plays left field and has one
of the best batting and base running
records in the league.
A Pennsylvania!!, Hamilton came
to the Farm because "back east
Stanford is 'the' school of the West
and because three of my classmates
at Kiski prep school—Alf Brandin,

Monk Moscrip, and Bob Reynolds—
were coming out here."
Bones' biggest surprise at Stan
ford came in the very first minute
of his first intercollegiate game.
On the kick-off pHy his jaw was
broken. "I'll never forget that as
long as I live," he grimly remarks.
Political science is the major chos- |
en by Hamilton. In that department 1
he intends to get a start towards a
foundation for a career in business, j
A junior now, Bones will only go to j
school one more year and then go to
work. "No pro football, either," he '
says. "Not unless it's absolutely :
necessary."
"A little golf and an occasional j
date. ' That's the way he accounts for 1
what little time he has left after j
studying, classes and daily turn-outs |
are over. Bones is a Zeta Psi, and, j
it is rumored, he takes something of
a beating at the hands of some half
dozen "200 - pound - tackle - size" !

"Some cock-eyed room-mate I
had at prep school started calling
me 'Ham'—l suppose because my
name is Hamilton. That evolved into
'Hambone' and finally into 'Bones'."
That's the way Bob "Bones" Ham
ilton reluctantly explains away the
moniker that Stanford, his team
mates and the world of football
knows him by. But he's used to his
skeleton-like name now, Bones says.
In fact when he ran for a B.A.C.
post in the last election they had his
name on the ballot as "Bob Hamil
ton" and more than a few student
voters didn't know wh*> it was.
Since the frosh foot bail season of
1932, Bones has been known to Stan
ford first and last as an athlete. He
is the rather diminutive half-back
who put the last big game on ice for
the Indians. And he is the man who
was awarded the Douglas Fairbanks
trophy last fall as a result of foot
ball players all over the country
voting him "the most valuable play
er of the season." Bones was given a
rating of 96.41 by the men who
played against him—the highest of
scores given to hundreds of gridders
in a nation-wide vote.
"Football is the best sport," Ham
ilton says, "but baseball is a mighty
fine game, too." The latter keeps
Bones in the sport-light the year
around, for as soon as the grid sea
son is over he is out taking direc
tions from Baseball Coach Harry
Walters who right now depends a
lot on him to keep the Card team
from going below the mediocre.
Bones plays left field and has one
of the best batting and base running
records in the league.
A Pennsylvania!!, Hamilton came
to the Farm because "back east
Stanford is 'the' school of the West
and because three of my classmates
at Kiski prep school—Alf Brandin,

Monk Moscrip, and Bob Reynolds—
were coming out here."
