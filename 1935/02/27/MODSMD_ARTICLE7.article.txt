# Flags To Be Dance Setting
## 
### 
Against a background of flags and
marching silhouette soldiers, couples I
will dance to the music of Ernie j
I Heckscher's 13-piece orchestra at the '
i formal Military Ball sponsored by
Scabbard and Blade from 9 to 1
o'clock Friday, in the Dance Studio, j
Bids for the dance are on sale for
1 $3 at the A.S.S.U. offices.
Letter openers in the form of
metal sabers pinned through black
j leather covers will make up the ;
! dance programs. A large scabbard J
; and blade will hang over the bal- I
cony. Against a silver ribbon curtain i
: mechanical silhouette soldiers will 1
march. A standard of flags will re- |
1 volve slowly during the evening.
The theme of the da nor is "behind
i the line during the war." Each dance
i will start with the playing of a bugle
i call for which it is named. Officers
i are urged to wear their uniforms.
