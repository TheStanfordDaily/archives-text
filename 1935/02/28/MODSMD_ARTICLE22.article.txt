# COURT UPHOLDS COMPANY UNION IN NRA VERDICT
## Weirton Decision Calls Law For Labor Protection Unconstitutional 
### 
WILMINGTON, Del., Feb. 27 (/P)
—A history-making fedeial court
decision today established legality
of the Weirton Steel Company's em
i ploye representation plan and held
| that section 7-A, heart of the Na
i tional Industrial Recovery Act, is in
j applicable to the company because
■it is not engaged in interstate com-
I merce in its relations to its employes.
Judge John P. Nields wrote the
i decision, holding that the plans of
j employe representation—a so-called
company union—in effect among the
| employes of Weirton, affords a law
ful and effective organization of the
j employes for collective bargaining
j through representatives of their own
j choosing.
Injunction Denied
i The government's suit, regarded
j as a major test of NRA's labor guar
! antee provision, was dismissed and
j (he plea for an injunction to restrain
I the company from dealing with the
employes through the medium of
J the company plan denied.
I "There is no showing on the part
i of the plaintiff warranting the court
!in issuing an injunction," Judge
j Nields ruled. "Section 7-A, as ap
j plied to defendant and its business, is
j unconstitutional and void."
; The decision reiterated that Con
jgress may pass laws regulating busi
| ness only of an interstate or foreign
j nature and held that the Weirton
I company is not engaged in such
j business "save to a negligible cx
! tent." The government had held that
| the Weirton business is interstate.
Hurts Labor Unions
Judge Nield's decision was a blow
1 at the contention of organized labor
;that the so-called company union is
a tool of industrial management to
circumvent the rights of workers to
organize and bargain collectively.
While government spokesmen pre
dicted the ruling would be appealed,
Weirton officials jubilantly hailed it.
