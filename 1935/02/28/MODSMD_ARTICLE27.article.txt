ginia SwafToid play the various char
acters.
The scene of Norman Stine's play,
"Twelve Decide," is laid in a jury
room. A negio is accused of murder,
and the jury is trying to reach a ver
dict. Although it is not reached dur
ing the course of the play, one sees
that because of personal bias and
racial prejudice the negro will be
convicted. The play, a biting com
mentary on the jury system, was
published in last year's English Club
Year Book.
The last of the three plays is a
fanciful romance, "Bread and
Honey," by James Benet. A princess
rebels against her pre-arranged mar
riage and falls in love with one of
her mother's courtiers. When it is re
vealed that the courtier is really the
prince to whom she is engaged, the
princess becomes incensed and re
fuses to marry him. There is much
banter and several mock battles,
which finally end in the reconcilia
tion of the two lovers.

be charged for tonight's presenta
tion.
