# Tribute to the Memory Of Jane Lathrop Stanford
## 
### 
Jane Lathrop Stanford, savior of this Uni
vcrsitv during its infancy, died thirty years
ago today.
II was Senator Stanford who founded the
I Diversity, but it was Mrs. Stanford who
saved it and was its greatest benefactor. II
was she who "stayed by the ship" and sacri
ficed her possessions through those six dark
years from 1893 to 1899 that the newly estab
lished institution might survive.
Her husband died in .lime of 1893. The
country's worst financial panic struck during
the summer. The two - year - old University
seemed doomed. The founder's estate was
lied up in the courts. Money was nowhere in
sight. Disaster seemed to hound Mrs. Stan
lord's every step.
Disregarding the almost unanimous advice
of her counsel to close the University, she
placed her devotion to the new institution
above all else. Skillfully she obtained a spe
cial court decision granting her a monthly
allowance to pay her "help," the total of which
she diverted to meet campus expenses. A
threatened Federal injunction to close the
University to collect a past debt took Mrs.
Stanford to Washington to ask President
Cleveland to speed the Supreme Court action
on the legality of the proposed injunbtion-
Stanl'ord had to slay open. A unanimous de
cision favored her.
And so the gallant Lady of the Farm never
faltered in her devotion to the University. It
was her aim to make Stanford "the ideal Uni
versity and to elevate it to the foremost rank
in this country."
As David Starr Jordan characterized her,
she was "one of the bravest, wisest, most pa
tient, most courageous, and most devout of
all women who have ever lived." To her, every
student on the Farm owes the privilege of
being here today.
