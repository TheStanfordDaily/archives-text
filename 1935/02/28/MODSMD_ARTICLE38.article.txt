# A 						Site for the World's Fair
## 
### 
After many months of careful planning and
discussion, :i definite site lims finally been
chosen for S;tn Francisco's World's Fair in
1938. II will he constructed on the Yerha
Muena Shoals in the middle of San Francisco
Bay,
II seems that for once honors in the reputed
rivalry between the northern city and Los
Angeles have hcen won by San Francisco. The
House Foreign A Hairs Committee in Wash
ington approved a resolution to invite foreign
nations to participate in the exposition. Mean
while a committee departs for Los Angeles
tomorrow to straighten out what was almost
a conflict. Los Angeles wanted to celebrate the
Moulder Dam completion the same year, 1938.
During the lust year erection orf the two
magnificent bridges has aroused interest of
campus students because Dr. Mailev Willis of
Ihe Stanford faculty has repeatedly warned
directors that the south pier of the Golden
(late Bridge is unsafe, and three years should
prove ample time to lest his contentions.
Only some forty miles away, Stanford is
ideally situated to participate in the colle
giate activities of the Fair. Many students will
probably find themselves working in some
phase of the* many activities connected with
the 19118 exposition, while San Francisco plays
host to people from all over the world.
