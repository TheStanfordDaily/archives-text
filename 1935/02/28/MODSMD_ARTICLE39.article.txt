# Stopping Bootleg Oil
## 
### 
Oil bootleggers, those grasping and short
sighted individuals who squander their na
tion's wealth to add a few dollars to their
pockets now instead of later, were dealt a
severe blow when President Moosevelt signed
the Connolly Oil Control Mill, thus putting
teeth into the regulation of production and
shipment of contraband oil.
Since the discovery of the fabulously rich
Fast Texas fields, these bootleggers have used
every means in their power to evade state reg
ulations and to market oil which is produced
in excess of the sensible limit set for conscrva
lion and fair prices.
Hidden pipe lines have carried contraband
across state lines; left - handed valves have
tricked inspectors into thinking the llow of
oil was shut off, and officials have been paid
to "look the other way" while illegal crude
flowed to the market, to be sold as a legal
product.
Regulation of national resources is no new
thing; it is a necessity it the country's wealth
is to be preserved. I neontrolled production
of oil, like unregulated felling of timber, will
result eventually in only harm.
lion were not controlled, even an extraordi
nary field like Fast Texas would run low in
in a lew years. My conservation, a state can
make sure that a fair price will be paid, that
quality will stand up under lest, and thai its
resources will he preserved.
The only loser is the illegal operator.
