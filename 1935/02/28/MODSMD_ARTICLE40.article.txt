# Spring and Bumpy Roads
## 
### 
The annual spring crop of rattles, squeaks,
and weak tires is sprouting in student auto
mobiles as the rainy season ends and the
never - too - smooth campus roads become
rougher. This distressing symptom is found
most often in cars which regularly traverse
the road which runs past Uranner to Mavfield.
Huts, rocks, and complete holes enliven an
afternoon's drive over this strip of asphalt;
and many are the justifiable curses that break
the spring stillness as an elderly car lakes
more than its share of punishment on the way
home.
The Administration has dune its share in
campus improvements this year. Building, re
modeling, and landscaping have already ex
ceeded the budget allowed for those purposes,
and there is little money available to lake care
of the necessary expense of maintenance.
Koads are had all over the campus, and we
can put up wilh most of Ihein in order 1o
secure needed expansion. But the expense
of temporary repairs iu Ibis one case would
be slight, and immediate action on this mai
ler by the Administration will save many a
broken spring and tide the situation over until
money is appropriated to rcpave the road.
