## COURSE-CREDIT AUTOMATS 
### 
Drop your coins in the slots, folks! Drop 'em in, and
out will come your credit units. This is the automat of
education, this is the college course-credit system. Put
in your coins, the necessary number of hours per week,
and, with mechanical precision, out jumps your credit
for the courses—three units for English A, five for
biology i and so forth.
But don't expect an education from the automat—
don't expect a dietetically well balanced meal. The
automat was made for that, but it's lacking. It gives you
a dab of this and a snack of that, not a wholesome
whole.
Thus is described the system in American colleges
by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of
Teaching after an extraordinary experiment in Penn
sylvania which lasted for six years. The experiment or
research, under the direction of a man with the punny
name of William Learned, proves in black and white
figures that the American college degree is worthless
as an indication of educational development.
This is what the Carnegie Foundation did. In a
single representative state with 18 public school systems
and 49 colleges co-operating, systematic tests were
given to thousands of students over a six-year period.
The tests were of the kind familiar to Stanford students
—the sort where questions can be answered with a
single word or plus-minus sign. The important thing
was that the tests were not based on material which
should be learned in certain standard courses, but on
general educational development.
The results showed conclusively that under the
course-credit system those colleges were just feed
ing their students unrelated facts for four years
and then handing them a degree. There was h;\rdly
a semblance of related, cultural knowledge.
Note some typical true-false questions from the
tests:
"Flaubert's novels emphasize scrupulous observa
tion, but pay little attention to artistic form." "The
violin was perfected later than the piano." "Rome is a
seaport." Over 8000 college students were apparently
stumped by such questions as these.
Vocabulary tests, probably the best method for de
termining general knowledge since no one can learn
new facts without learning new words, also exposed
college students for what they are. In the Carnegie
experiment one student who made an average score
thought that the word "benighted" meant "weary,"
that "spurious" meant "foamy," and that "recreant"
meant "diverting." One bright boy said "assiduous"
meant "foolish," and inadvertantly explained the gen
eral attitude of his colleagues.
The astounding thing in regard to the tests were
the results by college years. Eight tests were given:
Intelligence, English, Mathematics, General Cul
ture, General Science, Foreign Literature, Fine
Arts, History and Sochi Studies. And from first
to last the freshmen scored as well or a very few
points lower than the seniors! The sophomores and
juniors did worse than the freshmen, so that the
only possible conclusion that could be drawn was
that colleges are doing a fine job of UN-EDU
CATING its students—putting into their minds such
a jumble of facts that the related whole is mangled
to destruction. In English (spelling, grammar,
punctuation, vocabulary, and literature), mathe
matics, and history and social studies the ones
about to receive their degrees were less educated
than youngsters coming out of high school.
The reasons for the astounding findings of the Car
negie Foundation are obvious. When a student passes
a course, he is given a grade and a certain number of
units, and, as far as he is concerned, is through with
the subject for good. There is no impulsion to prqeeed
further, to master the subject more fully, no stimulus
towards self-education.
The course-credit system is outworn and a failure.
The trend in the more progressive institutions is away
from it. The so-called honors or divisional plan is
coming into its own at Chicago, Princeton, Harvard,
Swarthmore, and Minnesota. There most of the stu
dents work towards a related whole, towards a com
prehensive education. They do not feed a worthless
automat and get a worthless degree.

But don't expect an education from the automat—
don't expect a dietetically well balanced meal. The
automat was made for that, but it's lacking. It gives you
a dab of this and a snack of that, not a wholesome
whole.
Thus is described the system in American colleges
by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of
Teaching after an extraordinary experiment in Penn
sylvania which lasted for six years. The experiment or
research, under the direction of a man with the punny
name of William Learned, proves in black and white
figures that the American college degree is worthless
as an indication of educational development.
This is what the Carnegie Foundation did. In a
single representative state with 18 public school systems
and 49 colleges co-operating, systematic tests were
given to thousands of students over a six-year period.
The tests were of the kind familiar to Stanford students
—the sort where questions can be answered with a
single word or plus-minus sign. The important thing
was that the tests were not based on material which
should be learned in certain standard courses, but on
general educational development.
The results showed conclusively that under the
course-credit system those colleges were just feed
ing their students unrelated facts for four years
and then handing them a degree. There was h;\rdly
a semblance of related, cultural knowledge.
Note some typical true-false questions from the
tests:
"Flaubert's novels emphasize scrupulous observa
tion, but pay little attention to artistic form." "The
violin was perfected later than the piano." "Rome is a
seaport." Over 8000 college students were apparently
stumped by such questions as these.
Vocabulary tests, probably the best method for de
termining general knowledge since no one can learn
new facts without learning new words, also exposed
college students for what they are. In the Carnegie
experiment one student who made an average score
thought that the word "benighted" meant "weary,"
that "spurious" meant "foamy," and that "recreant"
meant "diverting." One bright boy said "assiduous"
meant "foolish," and inadvertantly explained the gen
eral attitude of his colleagues.
The astounding thing in regard to the tests were
the results by college years. Eight tests were given:
Intelligence, English, Mathematics, General Cul
ture, General Science, Foreign Literature, Fine
Arts, History and Sochi Studies. And from first
to last the freshmen scored as well or a very few
points lower than the seniors! The sophomores and
juniors did worse than the freshmen, so that the
only possible conclusion that could be drawn was
that colleges are doing a fine job of UN-EDU
CATING its students—putting into their minds such
a jumble of facts that the related whole is mangled
to destruction. In English (spelling, grammar,
punctuation, vocabulary, and literature), mathe
matics, and history and social studies the ones
about to receive their degrees were less educated
than youngsters coming out of high school.
The reasons for the astounding findings of the Car
negie Foundation are obvious. When a student passes
a course, he is given a grade and a certain number of
units, and, as far as he is concerned, is through with
the subject for good. There is no impulsion to prqeeed
further, to master the subject more fully, no stimulus
towards self-education.
The course-credit system is outworn and a failure.
The trend in the more progressive institutions is away
from it. The so-called honors or divisional plan is
coming into its own at Chicago, Princeton, Harvard,
Swarthmore, and Minnesota. There most of the stu
dents work towards a related whole, towards a com
prehensive education. They do not feed a worthless
automat and get a worthless degree.
Drop your coins in the slots, folks! Drop 'em in, and
out will come your credit units. This is the automat of
education, this is the college course-credit system. Put
in your coins, the necessary number of hours per week,
and, with mechanical precision, out jumps your credit
for the courses—three units for English A, five for
biology i and so forth.
