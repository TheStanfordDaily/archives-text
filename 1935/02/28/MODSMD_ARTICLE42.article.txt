Ever since Our Hasher's brilliant outburst of last
j week about the Alpha Sig cook being caught short by
the cops in a Redwood City fan-tan gam», the cooks up
i the Row have declared a boycott on Our Hasher. That
1 explains the absence of "cute sayings" in the colyum
j of late.
Jean Jack, caterer to the Sigma Chi appetite, is the
leader of the movement. There are rumors that parts of
the Sigma Chi housebills eventually find their way into
I the hands of thp Grant Avenue fan-tan entrepreneurs
j every week-end, but he states that he does not want
; the news to get in Our Hasher, because all his friends
up and down the Row read it and might pin something
! on him. Besides, Buddha might read it.
One of the secret desires of the cooks is to pick up
j some limousine for $10 with which to tear around the
country and impress their friends. The difficulty is
that the car of their dreams is usually priced about
j $50, and that's too much. They say that Jean Jack
is quite the driver of cars whenever he can borrow
one. Scars on the telephone pries up and down Lasuen
I are mute testimony to his gay, college youth driving.
We quote from an excerpt from a newspaper dis
patch from Hollister! "Among those arrested for speed
ing over the week-end were Leland T. Chapin and Don
T. Primrose Jr., both of Stanford University ;uid promi-
I nent fraternity men." The glory that was Greece!
