# BULL SESSION
## MORMONS, MORMONS, EVERYWHERE 
### 
OGDEN. Feb. 25.—Utah is a land
of religion. The church may be los
ing its grip everywhere else. Bujl in
the country of the Latter Day Saints,
religion is the thing. It is not only
that the Sunday church attendance
is on the up and up. But everywhere
you turn, there is a Mormon (and a
good Mormon at that) staring you
in the face.
The most impressive thing in Salt
Lake, of course, is the Mormon tab
ernacle. There is a miscellaneous as
sortment of acoustics in every cor
ner. Made entirely of wood, and
stuck together with wooden pegs
rather than nails, the tabernacle is
as resonayt as a Stradivarius. If
someone drops a box of pins at one
end of the building, it sounds like the
roar of a small Nigara at the other
end. Good Mormons never drop more
than one pin at a time.
But the Mormon church is more
than a few church buildings. Mines,
sugar refineries, a hotel, a bank, and
the better part of the biggest depart
ment store in Salt Lake City are
held in the name of Jesus Christ
of the Latter Day Saints. Further,
all good Mormons pay one-tenth of
their income to the support of the
church. With such financial under-

I pinning, it is no wonder that the
Mormons are able to reduce Mormon
unemployment to a minimum. Thus
are the profits of religion turned to
useful purpose.
What the Pope is to Catholics,
Heber Jebidiah Grant is to the
Mormons. Tall, partly bald, and with
ia snowy white, short beard, Presi
dent Grant looks the part of the
patriarch of over a half-million Mor
mons. Friendly and witty, President
Grant speaks freely of the days
; when the six-shooter was standard
Mormon equipment. No recluse, he
is equally at home at a board of di
rectors meeting or addressing a
' gathering of brethren.
i Tonight Rogers and I debated at
Weber College in Ogden. Of our two
opponents, one was a married man,
and the other had debating experi
ence extending back seven years.
Weber College (approximately GOO
! enrollment) turned out with the
; biggest audience in local history (ap
proximately 200). Outside of the fact
I that the chairman passed Bob Gros
off as a professor, the debate was
| as normal as could be expected.
Tomorrow night we feed the same
stuff to the unsuspecting sheep
herders of Pocatello, Idaho.
