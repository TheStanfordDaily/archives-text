RUMBA
At the Stanford Theatre
The haunting music of the sensu
ous rumba makes a captivating and
exciting film of a none too original

story, concerning
a mug hoofer on
the make for a
patrician beauty.
She is vacation
ing in a Cuban
dive, Paramount
informs us. Car
ole Lombard is

Ihe girl, and George Raft believes
her to possess what he calls "class."
At least, the voluptuous Carole
knows how to intercept a pass with
the best of them, and .'-he succeeds
in keeping Raft in his place—until
, the magic rumba unites the two for
a spectacular production finale.
Raft's role calls for much of his
i magnetic charm, but little acting
ability. Margo, that strangely fasci
nating little brunette of "Crime
j Without Passion ' fame, does have a
t chance to be passionate—in attempt
ing to hold her man from Park
Avenue. Margo, classy production,
intriguing atmospheric effects, and
the provocative rhythms of the
rumba are the film's chief qualities.
Because of them, it is well worth
seeing.
Also on the bill, "Society Doctor."
