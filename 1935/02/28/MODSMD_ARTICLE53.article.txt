## COAST WILL SURPRISE WITH 2-MILERS 
### 
From the angle of the friendly *but
somewhat jealous rivalry between
the East and the West over which
section of the country produces the
greatest athletes, the current and
probable future strength of Coast
2-milers is highly surprising.
Through all of the years of the
West's conscious superiority over the
Fast in track and field, the East re
mained untouched in the 2-mile.
This year, though now not so sure
of her pre-eminence in other run
ning events, the West should make
a serious bid for 2-mile places in the
national meets.

808 FOWLER
LEADS THE WAY

BRIGHT ONE
OK BEST TODAY

WINGEI) '()'
HAS GREAT PROSPECTS

DINK ON SPOT,
lilT MOPES GOOD

Bob Fowler of California led the
way last year by placing fifth in the
IC4-A 1500 meters race. Merely a
sophomore and from a school which
several years back wouldn't send
its Coast champion 2-miler, Captain
Spud Mossnian, to national compe
tition, Fowler's work signified that
the West is ready to produce long
distance runners.
This year there will he at least
four where there was only Fowler
Inst year. The Trojans have two
men, Lantz and Winn, who have
already run !» minutes ••jui 45 sec
onds this winter. Dave Devlin and
Rusty March of Stanford have yet
to break !):;»(), hut have been coin
ing along so rapidly in the. past
few weeks that their real speed is
yet unknown.

Of course Stanford's ineligible
Norm Blight is undoubtedly one of
I he fastest distance men in the coun
try today. His time of 9:35 for the
eight laps last fall, his belief that he
can be running around the 9:20 mark
this spring, and his races for the
Olympic Club during the coming two
months should prepare Bright for a
leading position in the N.C. 2-A mile
in Berkeley this summer.
When Edson Burrows of the frosh
is ready for varsity racing next year,
the Indians should feel at home in
any 2-mile competition. With a 4
minutes and 24 seconds high school
mile behind him, Burrows recently
ran 1(> seconds and later 24 seconds
under the little-big meet record, and
in the first 2-miles he had ever run
in competition.

Bright will by no means be the
only track great competing for the
Olympic Club this spring, for pres
ent prospects promise a great squad
for the Winged "O."
A.s usual the backbone of the
team will be made up of weight
men, inherited from several genera
lions of Dink Templeton's Card
troupes, including Here Laborde and
Bob Jones of a few years ago and
Johnny Lyman and Gordy Dunn of
last year. The Club will also have
Ben Eastman in the middle-dis
tances; Bob Clarke, California's
champ, in the broad jump; Cotto
Herbert in the hurdles; and Walter
Marty, world's record holder in the
high jump, to name a few.

Dink Templeton, now nationally
known as the coach of champion dis
cus throwers and shot putters, found
himself on the spot last spring with
the graduation of Lyman and Dunn,
his only consistent point winners in
1934. and only one man, Jim Rey
nolds, coming up with a frosh repu
tation.
What Card fans of long standing
will watch with interest is the suc
cess Dink has this spring in produc
ing his usual troupe of weight
champs, despite the dark prospects
of a year ago. Two junior college
transfers, Phil Levy and Jackson
King, are certain to be a distinct
help.
King, by the way, won a big red
varsity jersey wilh number "8" 011
the back two days ago with a discus
throw of 155 feet, by far his best
mark. The winning throw in the Big
Meet last year was 152 feet 8 :i 1
inches.
