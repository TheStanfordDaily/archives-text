# CARD NINE LOSES TO S.F. CLUB, 2-1; SHOWS PROGRESS
## Bones Hamilton Plays First Game at Short-stop 
### Johnny Miles 
Stanford's rapidly improving ball
team lost a tough .struggle to the Ke
; nealy Seals here yesterday afternoon
| by a 2 to 1 score.
Apparently determined to put a
stop to their continued poor showing,
the Cards came through with their
finest showing of the season. One
man erred in the field, that being
Bones Hamilton, who turned in a
! remarkably good game for his first
| at the short-stop position.
The Indians, led by Gordy Malla
tratt, outhit the visitors 6 to 4, but
failed to cash in on the runs column.
Captain Stan Anderson started his
first game of the season, and hurled
! some neat innings.
The short score:
RHE
Kenoaly Seals ...000 110 000—2 4 2
j Stanford 000 000 010—1 (5 3
Batteries: Cellini, Salonison and
Lapayri; Anderson, Campbell and
! Ferro.
