# INDIAN QUINTET RESUMES PRACTICE FOR CALIFORNIA BATTLE; TOPPING MAY PLAY
## 
### 
Resuming practice after a two
day lay-off, Coach John Bunn's In
dian hoopsters went through a spir
ited hour of scrimmage last night in
preparation for Saturday's game !
with California in Berkeley, for sec- I
ond place position in the Coast con
ference.
In the first five last night were Rod
Bust and Arne Anderson at forwards, i
Ken Nobs at center, and Dinty Moore !
and Robin Lindsey at guards.
Center Keith Topping was ap- i

parently making one of his many
recoveries from the numerous in
juries that have broken up his cur
rent hoop season. The recent back
injury, putting him out of the play
: last week end, is rapidly clearing
up, and Bunn believed that Topping
: would be ready for action against
; the Bears.
Emil Cowing and Bill Quade, for
! wards, Howell Turner, center, and
Wytz Gorter and A1 Page, guards,
composed the second five that scrim
â€¢ maged against the regulars last night.
