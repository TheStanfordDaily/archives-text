# Rugby Lineup Changed As Bear Game Nears
## 
### 
Frank Alustiza was moved to left
wing and Ray Lewis to second five
yesterday in a big lineup change, in
preparation for the all-important
California clash here Saturday. The
league championship hinges on the
outcome.
Alustiza will be valuable in his
new post, where he can use his
known ball-carrying ability, and
Lewis will add smoothness to the
passing attack.
If the Cards win, they have a
chance to go north to meet the
Canadian Reps.
