The implications of the present
decade for a close relationship be

being crystallized in certain new
courses offered by leading univer

the Harvard Business School, de

business aspects of public service.
Courses in the general field of
large scale planning will be offered

hereafter take more work in political
science in order to fit their business
graduates for social engineering.
At Stanford University the trends
