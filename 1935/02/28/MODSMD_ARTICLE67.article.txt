# Post Delayed Week By Overhauling of Airplane
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 27 (/P)â€”lt
probably will be "at least a week"
i before Wiley Post, globe-circling
> aviator, takes off on his high-speed
stratosphere flight to New York.
Billy Parker, his technical adviser,
said' today.
Post busied himself supervising a
complete overhauling of the motor
of his 'round-the-world monoplane,
the "Winnie Mae," in which he
started across the continent last Fri
day morning, but was forced down
in the Mojave Desert because of oil
i trouble after reaching 24,000 feet
altitude. The motor overhaul is to
eliminate any unfavorable condition
that may have resulted from Post's
steep climb at high speed after his
take-off.
