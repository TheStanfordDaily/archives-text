# MELLON DENIES 'SHORT' SALES
## Sharp Dip in Price Caused Financier To Buy 
### 
PITTSBURGH, Feb. 28 (JP).-A
denial that Andrew W. Mellon sold
stocks "short" during 19131 was made
today by Howard M. Johnson, the
financier's secretary, before the
Board of Tax Appeals at the hearing
of Mellon's $3,000,000 income tax
case.
Johnson had testified last week
that two "short sales" had been made
in March of 1931 in a special broker
age account maintained by Mellon.
Corrected Statement
Today he said he wished to cor
rect thatâ€”that the sale "actually was
not a short one" but one made with
the intention of delivering slocks al
ready in Mellon's portfolio.
He explained the market price
dipped sharply between the time the
order to sell one block had been
given to the broker, and his delivery
of stock from Mellon's safety deposit
box, and that he decided to "buy"
instead of deliver the stock.
The testimony was given at Mel
lon's $3,000,000 income tax hearing
before the Board of Appeals.
Ascalot Debt
On January 1, 1932, Ascalot owed
Mellon $104,065, according to his
books. There were no transfers in
that year but in 1933, Ascalot sold
Mellon 2.500 shares of Western Pub
lic Service and 428 shares of U.S.
Steel on which the net loss was
about $2,000.
At that point, because of loans,
the evidence showed Mellon owed
Ascalot $11,026 and in July and
November he loaned the company
$15,000. On November 21, Ascalot
sold through a broker 4,600 shares of
Southern Pacific stock, which had
been given to Mrs. Bruce by Mellon,
turning the proceeds into her father's
account.
On this transaction, the company
registered a net loss of $375,681.87.
