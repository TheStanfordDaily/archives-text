## Spring Innovations Offer Varied Choices in Men's Styles 
### Herb Diamond 
If the new spring interpretations
in sports clothes seen about the
Quad and the Farm in general are
to serve as any indication, the rug
ged, time-honored Stanford rough
i.-> dressing up.
And what with the vast array of
current innovations to choose from
it. suitings, sports coats, slacks, and
sweaters to draw his attention, well j
may he become clothes-minded.
Patterned fabrics, for instance —
bold checks, equally prominent |
plaids, and stripings in shaggy wool
ens, tweeds, and cheviots as well as
hard-finished worsteds and gabar
dines are being favored at the mo
ment and .should continue to greater
popularity. In design, low-roll
double-breasted jackets carrying
square-patch pockets and a single
center vent in the back are catching
on both in sports suits and coats.
Ilaglan Shoulders
The coat, which progressed from
the original bi-swing to the shirred
back and finally to tho inverted pleat
or vented back, comes this spring
wilh raglan shoulders. Topcoats fea
turing this shoulder construction
have long been recognized for the
extra looseness and freedom they of
fer over the regulation set-in sleeve.
Slack type trousers carrying zip
per fronts, inverted seams, rather
high waists and being extra fully cut
in every detail are definitely in the
fashion picture. Suit trousers and
separate slacks seem to exhibit sim
ilar general construction. The most
favored in the latter category, how
ever, are made with the side tabs,
usually held by ring fasteners, and
are cut a bit more generously to
achieve that effect of studied care
lessness.
Patterns Prevalent
A noteworthy departure in the
knitted sportswear field comes in the
newer pullover models this season
which are running to patterns in
stead of the plain colors prevalent in
the past. The sweater sets, never
theless, are yet favored in plain col
ors and are now being shown in the
usual array of brilliant spring hues.
Shirred backs, inverted pleats, and
several variations in the placing of
vents feature these favorites.
Those short-sleeved sports shirts
that come under the general heading
of polo shirts are currently enjoying
well-deserved favoritism. They have
seen fit to drop their formally full
length sleeves to the quarter-length
variety, and that is the way they are
being bought now.
Necks Cut Low
The usual neck construction is low
in cut, being fastened at tho collar
with a ■-ingle button. Bui the newer
types feature collars that fasten with
a row of buttons, a lacing arrange
men, or with a single cord to be tie'd
at the top. All of these shirts look
particularly well when worn with
mufflers in harmonizing shades.
Another noteworthy item shown
for spring is the white, or at least
very light, sports jacket. These come
in most any fabric you want, be it
linen, gabardine, or cheviot, and
achieve the best effect when com
bined with an odd pair of slacks of
deep contrasting tons. All of the
newest versions of the pleated and
vented back are carried; the most
outstanding being shown in a white
cheviot with a light window-pane
plaid in blue or brown with shirred
back, center vent extending to the
belt line, and saddle bag pockets.
Window pane patterns, incidentally,
are very good in all sportswear,
suits, slacks, or separate jackets.
