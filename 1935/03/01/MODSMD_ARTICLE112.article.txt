Instead of the customary all-blue
or brown shoe, this spring's fashions
in footwear call for a combination
and blending of lighter shades with

presuming that the blue will be
either the very deep marine, or the
blighter clipper, we will see accents
of white, chamoise, yellow, deer
taupe, Paris gray, and cameo pink.
