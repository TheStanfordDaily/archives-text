# Best Dressed Men This Spring Wear Colorful Shirts
## 
### 
Joseph's coat of many colors had |
nothing on the new shirts being
shown at the best men's shops. Shirts
of all colors, fabrics, and styles flash j
in windows everywhere.
Plaids and stripes lead in the va
rious lines in all combinations of
colors. They go especially well with
knit ties and sports coats. Solid col
ors come in deep blue, green, and
tan.
The button-down collar, which of- !
fers emancipation for the fastidious I
from misbehaving points, is being j
shown in white, solids, and stripes. :
It has a medium sized neck band and j
does not fit so low on the neck as the
Pique shirt with full inch band.
White is still available for those j
who prefer it, however. Broadcloth
whites in all models with tab or !
button-down collars are in stock i
everywhere.
Color and design aren't the only j
new things, however. Most stores are j
featuring the new "no-wilt" shirt, |
guaranteed against curling tips or j
wilting. It is displayed side by side j
with an ordinary shirt in a glass tank J
filled with water. Wafer, of course, j
has no effect on the shape of the i
newly-developed garment.
No starch, no-wilt collars of all va- I
rieties, and in all designs and colors, I
are to be featured this spring, par- j
ticularly in stores catering to those j
who have to watch the dollars. Their (
patented construction lends longer
life and better appearance.
