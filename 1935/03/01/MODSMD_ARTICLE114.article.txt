# Slacks, Loose Jackets Make Up 'Beer Suits'
## 
### 
The "beer suit" is the name of the
latest thing "to just play around in."
It is two-piece: faultlessly fitting
tailored slacks, buttoning at the sides
with some new version of the wooden
button; and a long, wide-sleeved,
loose fitting jacket that zips all the
way down the front. The zipper al
lows the top to be worn as either a
jacket or shirt.
Plain or print linen or ginghams
are suggested for scarfs and blouses
to be worn with the "beer suit."
Antelope, one of the newest mate
rials to be used in millinery, is being
made in berets of soft pastel and
darker colors; it is a pull-over-the
forehead style.
