# Brown Derby Evolving Into New Homburg
## English Hat Originates With Narrow Band 
### 
Not that there is any visible con
nection between A! Smith's brown
derby and the widespread popularity
of the dark brown snap-brim felt,
but since the days when the afore
mentioned tawny top-piece was as
well-known as the colorful political
genius who wore it, the brown snap
brim has held uncontested suprem
acy in men's hat fashions.
But recently fashion observers
have noted a tendency to change this
condition, and several new, smart
hats bid fair to usurp the position or
divide it among them. The first vis
ible change was the black band on
the brown snap-brim, followed by
the covert color snap-brim with a
black bend.
Early last fall a brand new shape,
originating in England, made its ap
pearance; we described it.s narrow
band and low, telescoped crown, por
fectly suited to accompany country
or campus clothes of rougher tex
ture. For spring, now only a few long
weeks away, it is reappearing in the
latest color from London â€”a mid
night blue, so dark as to be almost
black, and made in an appropriate
lighter weight felt. Along with (his
comes a new rough texture felt hat
with a tweed band rather than the
usual grosgrain silk, making the hat
entirely in keeping with the cur
rent trend in country clothes.
For town wear the Homburg bids
for favor in rougher finishes, the
usual silk bound edge being elimi
nated, with the self-turned and
stitched edge being the desired and
fashion-right finish. For dressier
, moments in town and with tuxedo
the black Homburg has the distinc
tion that is much to he desired for
! this purpose. This hat would have
lost caste quickly had it been ac
cepted by those "arty" persons who
have worn black hats as a tempera
mental gesture. The fact that it has
not indicates excellent future possi
bilities for the black Homburg.
