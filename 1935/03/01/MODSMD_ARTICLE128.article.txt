# Quad Clothes Bid for Favor With More Formal Attire
## Street Fashion Turns Toward Nettings, Laces Beige Net, Braided Lace Add Distinctiveness To Pastels 
### 
Appealingly feminine and dainty, j
the season's collection of afternoon i
frocks are showing a definite trend
for frills, nets, and lace trims of all
kinds. Especially new is the lingerie
trim, featuring clouds of fine white
lace at the throat and cuff line.
Laces are also being dyed to har
monize with fabric colors. Beige net
comes to the limelight for adding
distinctiveness to cloudy pastels.
Braided lace, after the fashion of the
once popular Battenburg, adorns the
semi-tailored dress, particularly
those with jackets.

And by the same token, practically
everything has a jacket this year—
fingertip, three-quarter, or the
charming and dignified redingote
again. A quaint old shop in Palo
Alto shows a dark sleeveless redin
gote over a sheer printed crepe that j
is most attractive.
In spring materials, matelesse is ;
the most outstanding, with taffeta a j
close second. The freshness and va
riety of the matelesse weave appears
in almost all the afternoon clothes.
Taffeta confines itself to the more j
dressy afternoon ensemble and is |
seen in many smart suits.
Taffeta trims are good on many
outfits, and huge checked taffeta
bows add a cunning touch to suits.
Many of the two-piece afternoon
dresses sport quilted taffeta coats or j
quilted collars and cuffs, which are
stunning in their own right and har
monize beautifully with matelesse
crepe.
Another clever innovation is the
use of steel heads for ornamenting
dresses. These are in many shapes
and sizes, and are seen to good ad
vantage on the graceful peasant '
sleeves of afternoon frocks. A rec- '
tangular design done in natural and j
white steel heads adorn rose and i
white peasant sleeves of a cameo !
rose dress to be viewed in a Palo
Alto shop.
Embroidery in Favor
Embroidery, too, in gay floral pat- ;
tern, enliven full sleeves, and the
throat ties of jackets. A banana yel
low sports dress for afternoon takes j
on a delightfully feminine air with
the addition of embroidery.
A second dress featuring embroi
dery hangs in a shop window on Uni
versity avenue. Of pristine white
matelesse crepe, the embroidery is
seen both on the sleeves of the jack
et and the high Russian collar.
Colors for spring afternoons run
the length of the pastel color chart,
in cloudy shades intriguingly named
coral mist, cameo rose, wheat gold,
acid green, crystal green, sunbeam,'
gold, and dawn blue. Gray, navy blue
and black also take bows.

And by the same token, practically
everything has a jacket this year—
fingertip, three-quarter, or the
charming and dignified redingote
again. A quaint old shop in Palo
Alto shows a dark sleeveless redin
gote over a sheer printed crepe that j
is most attractive.
In spring materials, matelesse is ;
the most outstanding, with taffeta a j
close second. The freshness and va
riety of the matelesse weave appears
in almost all the afternoon clothes.
Taffeta confines itself to the more j
dressy afternoon ensemble and is |
seen in many smart suits.
Taffeta trims are good on many
outfits, and huge checked taffeta
bows add a cunning touch to suits.
Many of the two-piece afternoon
dresses sport quilted taffeta coats or j
quilted collars and cuffs, which are
stunning in their own right and har
monize beautifully with matelesse
crepe.
Another clever innovation is the
use of steel heads for ornamenting
dresses. These are in many shapes
and sizes, and are seen to good ad
vantage on the graceful peasant '
sleeves of afternoon frocks. A rec- '
tangular design done in natural and j
white steel heads adorn rose and i
white peasant sleeves of a cameo !
rose dress to be viewed in a Palo
Alto shop.
Embroidery in Favor
Embroidery, too, in gay floral pat- ;
tern, enliven full sleeves, and the
throat ties of jackets. A banana yel
low sports dress for afternoon takes j
on a delightfully feminine air with
the addition of embroidery.
A second dress featuring embroi
dery hangs in a shop window on Uni
versity avenue. Of pristine white
matelesse crepe, the embroidery is
seen both on the sleeves of the jack
et and the high Russian collar.
Colors for spring afternoons run
the length of the pastel color chart,
in cloudy shades intriguingly named
coral mist, cameo rose, wheat gold,
acid green, crystal green, sunbeam,'
gold, and dawn blue. Gray, navy blue
and black also take bows.
Appealingly feminine and dainty, j
the season's collection of afternoon i
frocks are showing a definite trend
for frills, nets, and lace trims of all
kinds. Especially new is the lingerie
trim, featuring clouds of fine white
lace at the throat and cuff line.
Laces are also being dyed to har
monize with fabric colors. Beige net
comes to the limelight for adding
distinctiveness to cloudy pastels.
Braided lace, after the fashion of the
once popular Battenburg, adorns the
semi-tailored dress, particularly
those with jackets.
