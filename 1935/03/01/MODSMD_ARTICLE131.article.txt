# Regency Bonnet, New Sailors Dominate Spring Hat Styles
## 
### EUNICE ENGELKE 
As the lid pops oft the Spring hat
box, an array of sailors and bonnets,
the perkiest, sauciest hats in ages
pops out to enchant every feminine
eye.
If you're piquant and small fea
tured, there's the new version of the
Breton sailor, with its kettle brim
standing up in fence fashion • all
around, and there's the new "re
gency" bonnet," shown with the
quaint "regency" dresses.
Features Femininity
Originated by the son of George
111 while a gay, young blade at court,
the bonnet is as provokingly femi
nine as the Prince Regent could
make it, and it fairly demands a pro
fusion of curls and bangs and trink
ets for the hair—all of which is very
satisfying to the small girl in each of
our hearts.
Sailors in all versions will be es
pecially smart this spring, due to the
importance of tailored, daytime
dresses and suits. There arc those
with wide brims, little brims, double
brims, bumper brims, but their
dominant characteristics are round,

flat crowns, and deeper backs than
ever. In other crown variations, hats
are flat and telescoped,, or lightly
peaked in the mandarin feeling.
Berets . Varied
Then there's the new treatment of
the beret, which is draped toward
the back of the head this season,
while in the cloche, the Russian ef
fect is still very smart.
As for colors, the most popular are
the high colors such as geranium,
turquoise, and Ming gold. A clever
campus note is the dyeing of hats
to match sweaters, both in strong
contrast to darker skirts. Always the
emphasis is upon contrast rather
than on matching, as for example,
turquoise with brown, or geranium
with oxford grey.
Important straws of the season are
the baku and the ballibuntl, but the
newest straw of all is the sippcr, or
"burnyard" straw, which comes only
in the natural tone. Then there are
the "pain- brule," or "burnt bread"
straws, and rough, shining bamboo
for sports, while taffetas are smart
in, harmonizing with! the taffeta
touches on afternoon dresses.

the bonnet is as provokingly femi
nine as the Prince Regent could
make it, and it fairly demands a pro
fusion of curls and bangs and trink
ets for the hair—all of which is very
satisfying to the small girl in each of
our hearts.
Sailors in all versions will be es
pecially smart this spring, due to the
importance of tailored, daytime
dresses and suits. There arc those
with wide brims, little brims, double
brims, bumper brims, but their
dominant characteristics are round,

flat crowns, and deeper backs than
ever. In other crown variations, hats
are flat and telescoped,, or lightly
peaked in the mandarin feeling.
Berets . Varied
Then there's the new treatment of
the beret, which is draped toward
the back of the head this season,
while in the cloche, the Russian ef
fect is still very smart.
As for colors, the most popular are
the high colors such as geranium,
turquoise, and Ming gold. A clever
campus note is the dyeing of hats
to match sweaters, both in strong
contrast to darker skirts. Always the
emphasis is upon contrast rather
than on matching, as for example,
turquoise with brown, or geranium
with oxford grey.
Important straws of the season are
the baku and the ballibuntl, but the
newest straw of all is the sippcr, or
"burnyard" straw, which comes only
in the natural tone. Then there are
the "pain- brule," or "burnt bread"
straws, and rough, shining bamboo
for sports, while taffetas are smart
in, harmonizing with! the taffeta
touches on afternoon dresses.
