# Convertible Dresses Serve Day and Night
## 
### 
i At last it has comeâ€”the all day
dress that can be worn in the eve
| ning. A prominent San Francisco
| shop is showing a modd designed to
win the hearts of the never-station
-1 ary younger generation. Done in a
! black silk suitable for shopping,
i lunch, and a matinee in the after
; noon, the dress may be converted for
evening by the simple addition of an
! extra flounce zippered on to add
1 length.
1 When not in use the flounce may
be used as a cape, or left at home, or
j perhaps added to the white man's
burden and stuck , in "Johnny's"
j pocket along with "her" comb, pow-
I der puff, lipstick, toothbrush, hand
| kerchief, and like articles of civili
-1 zation.

For evening, choose between taf
feta and linen or printed satin and
lace. For informal evenings, some
thing with original sleeves; for
grand occasions, the barest of shoul
ders.
