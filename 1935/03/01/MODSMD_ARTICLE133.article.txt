# Formal Suit Is Height of Style For Tea Dance
## 
### Virginia Hawkes 
When those rare and very special
I occasions come along with tea danc
, ing in view the first question that
; enters a girl's mind is what to wear.
I This year, with formal suits very
| much in vogue, a suit of this type is
1 entirely proper to wear. These suits
' are found in the light spring shades
I of grey and beige, as well as many in
j blue and black, which are always
; good. â€¢ This season they are found
I with dashing fur trims on the cuffs
; again, and one very lovely suit of
navy blue is trimmed with luxurious
j white fox fur.
Correct Dress Listed
The afternoon dress is always very
. correct for such occasions, and now
j these are lovely and simple with the
| sweet femininity which is so charac
! teristic of 1935 spring fashions. There
j are the ti'aditional afternoon dresses
j and jacket dresses in the new relief
prints and in those lovely sketchy
prints which are often times bright
ened up with a gay sash. The dresses
! are always simple from the waist
down and are very apt to be full at
! the throat.
| There are many capes to be found
I in combination with the dresses, and
( many times the cape will be a wool
i one in the same color as the back
j ground of the print. Another domi
! nant note is to be found in the pres
| ence of many quilted taffeta coats
I for all occasions.
Colors Combined
As for colors, black and white and
i navy and white are combined as
j popularly as ever, and navy is being
combined with pastels a great deal.
Grey is again a popular color and
j the prints are very lovely in dark
backgrounds with bright colors on
I them.
