# Fashion World Goes In for Odd Buttons
## 
### 
Anything from niggertoes to wal- j
nuts on the half shell are buttoning '
this season's dresses and suits. Slice 1
one Brazilian nut, and there you
have a grand decoration for a twin
sweater set, which is the last word
in spring button smartness.
Crystal buttons are best on dark
fabrics or on taffeta blouses, and if
they're plaid or composite colors,
they're grand for light woolens and
tweeds. High necklines cry for link
buttons, and some have bracelets to
match. There are square buttons,
bullet buttons, "saucers," cylinders,
miniature tree trunks and even flow
ers, for above all, the fashion world
is button-conscious, and takes its
trimming seriously.
Something different in play suits
are the blue or brown and white
polka dot gingham ones.
