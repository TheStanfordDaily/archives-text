# Stanford Co-eds Knit Sweaters and Skirts For Practical Wear
## 
### 
When even practical feminine j
members of the Daily staff purl care- I
fully, laboriously pick up dropped !
stitches, the campus knows posi- I
tively that the "Back to the Farm"
movement is triumphing. The re
turn to home production and con
sumption are evident, for many
Stanford women are knitting their
own sweaters, skirts, and scarfs.
Knitted garments are by far the
most practical for spring wear on
Quad, for they are simple, becoming,
and easily cared for. Heavier yarns j
make comfortably warm sweaters for |
chilly and windy days, while light
weight boucles and "linen" yarns
can be fashioned into cooler, lacier
garments.
