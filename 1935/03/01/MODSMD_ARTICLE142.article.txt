# Check Plaid Is Smart in Spring Wear for Quad
## Seersucker, Linens, and Gingham Materials Are Favored 
### 
March winds to the contrary, the
Quad will soon be gay with light j
cottons and linens, which are the
delight of every coed.
The favored materials are seer- j
sucker, gingham, and all the linens, ,
especially the uncrushables. Plaids, j
stripes, and checks are still the |
smartest patterns, and the brighter j
the material, the better.
Red, White, and Blue
One can be patriotic and fash- i
ionable at the same time, for red, j
white, and blue is still considered a J
good combination. A plaid gingham :
in these colors has a double shirt
collar, three navy buttons down the
from, ;flid is especially individual in
the belt, which is a cord of giant [
thickness covered with the plaid,
and fastened on the ends with navy
yarn balls.
Ric-rac braid is very good this
spring, and is especially attractive
on the wide yellow collar of a black
and yellow plaid seersucker.
The shirtmaker style is good in
any man's country; in gingham it is
even better. One is of a light green,
white, and brown plaid, with small
brown buttons and a triangular scarf.
Lona cloth, which resembles a very
heavy linen, fashions a gray and blue
plaid shirtmaker, with a wide gros
grain belt of red and navy.
Tunic Is Timely
The tunic is still in, and has even
moved to linens. One outstanding
dress, two piece, is of dark green
linen, which buttons down the back,
and is trimmed with small bits of
embroidery. The latter may sound
as if it were dragged out of grand
mother's hopechest, but it really im
proves an already goodlooking dress.
A seersucker that contains at least
a third of all the known colors and
is still very smart is found in a two
piece sport dress which should be
easy to take care of.
Since this is a suit year, one finds
suits in linen as well as the heavier
materials. A brown and white mix
ture fashions one suit, which has the
action back, and a tailored skirt with
inverted plaits.
As long as you appear in some
thing bright, light and comfortable,
you will realize this is indeed a gay
as well as a smart season.

delight of every coed.
The favored materials are seer- j
sucker, gingham, and all the linens, ,
especially the uncrushables. Plaids, j
stripes, and checks are still the |
smartest patterns, and the brighter j
the material, the better.
Red, White, and Blue
One can be patriotic and fash- i
ionable at the same time, for red, j
white, and blue is still considered a J
good combination. A plaid gingham :
in these colors has a double shirt
collar, three navy buttons down the
from, ;flid is especially individual in
the belt, which is a cord of giant [
thickness covered with the plaid,
and fastened on the ends with navy
yarn balls.
Ric-rac braid is very good this
spring, and is especially attractive
on the wide yellow collar of a black
and yellow plaid seersucker.
The shirtmaker style is good in
any man's country; in gingham it is
even better. One is of a light green,
white, and brown plaid, with small
brown buttons and a triangular scarf.
Lona cloth, which resembles a very
heavy linen, fashions a gray and blue
plaid shirtmaker, with a wide gros
grain belt of red and navy.
Tunic Is Timely
The tunic is still in, and has even
moved to linens. One outstanding
dress, two piece, is of dark green
linen, which buttons down the back,
and is trimmed with small bits of
embroidery. The latter may sound
as if it were dragged out of grand
mother's hopechest, but it really im
proves an already goodlooking dress.
A seersucker that contains at least
a third of all the known colors and
is still very smart is found in a two
piece sport dress which should be
easy to take care of.
Since this is a suit year, one finds
suits in linen as well as the heavier
materials. A brown and white mix
ture fashions one suit, which has the
action back, and a tailored skirt with
inverted plaits.
As long as you appear in some
thing bright, light and comfortable,
you will realize this is indeed a gay
as well as a smart season.
