# New Bathing Wear May Startle Some
## Satin, Linen with Lastex Are New and Smart 
### 
Invaders of the beaches this year
will see many dashing and some
what shocking, if one is easily
shocked, beach outfits worn by the
very modern girl. Beach apparal has
not taken as much of o turn for the
feminine as have other clothes, but
they are to be made of as little as
possible and perhaps even a little
less than they were last year.
The two-piece suits of bra and
shorts are very good again this
spring, and they are also to be found
in the new bloomer and diaper mod
els in rather unusual material that
have never before invaded the line
of beach apparel.
Satin with a lastex foundation is
something very new and really very
sporting for the beachgoer. Linen
has likewise been made on a lastex
foundation for bathing suits and ap
pears to be a little more substantial
than the satin ones.
For the girls who want to be very
daring, the new and extremely smart
cellophane attire is just right. These
are found in blacks and blues made
in very intriguing models, and a girl
in one of these will be more than
just noticed on the beach.
The lastex wool suits worn last
year are equally good this season
and are the pride and joy of the real
swimmer at the beaches and in pools
everywhere.

The derby was introduced as a
1 fashion in America in 1874.
