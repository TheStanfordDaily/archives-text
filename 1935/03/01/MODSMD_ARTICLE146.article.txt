# New Lingerie Uses Bridal White Satin
## Pastel Prints Also Show Spring Femininity 
### 
Spring styles in Lingerie are in
clined toward the modes followed by
all brides, and although this is the
bride's own particular fashion, this
year all women will be copying her.
In other words, white lingerie is
very much the vogue for this year.
Never has lingerie been so lovely as
this spring in the beautiful white
satins that are being featured by all
heads of fashion everywhere. The
white satin is in most cases made all
the more beautiful by the dark ecru
lace used for trim. In this is noted
another leaning toward the more
feminine in spring fashions. *
Lingerie is the loveliest of pastel
prints in another innovation of this
year's feminine fashions. These
prints are particularly lovely in a
very soft pussy willow silk. They are
also to be found in satins.
One of the loveliest innovations in
color this spring Ls the new rich, al
most honey colored satin called Mag
nolia by fashion experts. Lingerie
made of this material is for the most
part in tailored styles which rely en
tirely upon the cut and fabric for
their simple beauty.

Tailored suits—the strictly tai
lored ones—must have snap. Col
lars and revers have new lines, so
has the back.

Buttons go on and on, getting
smarter and smarter. Good ones
simply make a dress.
