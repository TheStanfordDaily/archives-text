# Fabric Variety for Evening Permits Striking Silhouettes
## Smooth, Crisp Materials Adaptable to Many Soft Treatments 
### 
The most designating feminine
heart could not ask for a more com
plete variety of fabrics in which to
express her taste in evening clothes
than is being paraded before her this
spring. We see the extremely soft
fabrics, the stiffer materials which
have enough "body" to permit their
being adapted to picturesque lines,
and the more intermediate materials
for the dress of accepted silhouettes.
Marquisette Favored
In the soft fabrics we find a great
many airy, lovely sheers, such as
marquisette, which is lovely over
rustling taffeta, and net, which is
seen constantly. Very often single
and double layers of the net give the
frock interesting shaded effects.
Also in line with the trend toward
nineteenth century modes, we see a
great deal of fine lace, particularly in
black, which lends itself to pleating,
ruffling, and other soft treatments. In
the coarser laces, it is more usual to
see white and pastels.
ChiiTon Effective
Equally effective is chiffon, which,
though very sheer, can be given
weight by all-over embroidery of
fine pine tucks. For later in the sea
son, Mousseline de soie, particularly
in white with cushion dot embroid
ery, will be used.
Cotton, either in pastel, a clear
j color cross-barred in a brighter con
| trasting shade, or in gingham is sure
to be very popular with anyone who
I goes in for dancing in the spring and
! summer evenings. It has a cool, crisp
| effect which is both pleasing to the
j eye and comfortable for the wearer.
