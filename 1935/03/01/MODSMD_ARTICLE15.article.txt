# Atom Myth Is Shattered
## 
### 
Shattered is the famous "atomic
I screwdriver" story of the engineer
! ing department.
The word has gotten around that
I it's all a myth—that the often-told
account of the Stanford professor
j who had invented a screwdriver
j which would quickly and efficiently
j drive screws by merely pointing it in
the general direction of the threaded
■ bolt is unfounded.
| It was a good story, too, until
someone gave it away. And plausible.
A man in the engineering depart -
j ment, so the story went, had at last
j discovered a way of creating and us
! ing atomic energy. He applied it to
j the ordinary screwdriver, which,
when connected to his highly comp
j licatcd atomic energy-producing
| mechanism had the miraculous pow
jer of eliminating the wrist motion
: in driving screws.
The ones who told the story always
'explained that the invention hadn't
been put on the market because each
! screwdriver cost a thousand dollars.
Who let the cat out of the bag—
who let it be known that the miracle
invention is just a hoax has not been
revealed. —The —debunking—removed
the illusion of glamour about very
staid engineering labs from many a
! credulous and gullible scientific
! innocent.
