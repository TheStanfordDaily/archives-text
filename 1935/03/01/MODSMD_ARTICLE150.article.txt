# Correct Color Tints In Nail Polish Vary At Lighter Extreme
## 
### 
As a concession to masculine pre
judice against screamingly bright
nail polish, the trend of color is
toward natural and medium tints
for daytime, with cherry and rose
the favorites for evening affairs.
One of the largest manufacturers
of polish stresses the importance of
harmony of make-up, and presents
a lipstick to match each shade of
his product.
According to manicurists, the al
mond shape nail is the only kind
that should have polish applied all
over it, the average type being bet
ter suited to the natural contrast of
the pink wi'th the white tip.
The new cream polish is a boon to
those whose nails are naturally dry
or have been cracked by constant
application of the liquid beautifier.
The paste is absorbed by the nail and
is guaranteed to retain its gloss for
a week, even under the acid test of
chemistry labs and swimming classes.
