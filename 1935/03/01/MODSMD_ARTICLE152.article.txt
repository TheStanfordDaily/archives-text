### 
) We are going to be confronted !
j with the most dazzling array of
! feminine fashions this spring since
i the time of their originator — the
Prince Regent of Great Britain.
| Styles of the Regency Period, with
j their brilliant shades and figure
; revealing lines, have traveled over a ;
hundred years to take the world of j
spring fashions by storm.
Regent Gay
From 1810 to 1820 the eldest son
of King George 111, a young man
j with an eye for fashiops, reigned
J over England. He was a gay young
I fellow, and he loved bright colors
! and clinging gowns.
The effect of his reign upon styles
j was revolutionary. During the ten
j years of his rule the women of
I Britain blossomed forth in gowns of
j new color and altered lines to please
j their beauty-loving ruler.
Colors Contrast
Today these same colors and lines
j are ultra-smart. Fuscia, bright blue,
; clear green, red and white—all true,
unaltered shades are being used.
There will be gay color contrasts,
I dramatic full sleeve effects, low-cut
square necklines, high waistlines,
and soft shirrings on sleeves and at i
' the throat.
