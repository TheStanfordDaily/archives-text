### Klasine Van der Sluis 
Never before in the annals of eve
ning fashions has there been a more
choice selection of gay colors and
styles, ranging from flatteringly de
mure to extremely sophisticated
types of dresses.
The outstanding thing about eve
ning gowns for spring is that there is
a fabric, color, and style to express
every type of personality and to suit
every mood.
Regency Gowns Star
Dresses copied from the Regency
Period are holding the spotlight in
spring openings. Featuring low
waistlines, high collars, a soft folded
bustline, and the peacock sweep
skirt, which is a bit shorter in front
and has a full sweeping back, these
gowns cling to the figure with soft,
flowing lines.
The favorite colors are powder
blue, leaf green, lavender, pink, and
white. Black, of coui'se, is always
smart and very becoming.
Dresses Show Figures
All evening dresses are being
fashioned of figure-revealing mate
rials such as net, lace, and chiffon.
Chiffon, both pastel and printed, will
be one of the most popular fabrics,
because it lends itself so readily to
the new silhouette.
Taffeta and all types of rustling
material will be used for the more
formal gown, since the return to dig
nified femininity calls for the swish
of silk skirts in the evening. Taffetas
will be particularly smart when
trimmed in fluted organdy of the
same shade as the gown.
Variety in Cottons
Cotton for the warmer weather is
the dictate of fashion. The spring
cottons are colorful, comfortable, and
beautiful. Piques, linens, and seer
suckers will receive the unanimous
approval of the wise, smartly dressed
woman who likes variety without
sacrificing the quality of her ward
robe. In pastels, bright shades, and
gingham combinations they are ideal
for dancing on spring and summer
evenings.
Pink is a logical, flattering evening
color, and deserves a place in your
wardrobe plans for spring.
