# Soft, Light Felts, Narrower Ribbons, Lead Hat Fashions
## 
### 
Stanford men are being lured
constantly by new hats with broader
snap brims, and rougher and lighter
fells.
There are several innovations in
hats this spring, particularly in in
formal styles. As a whole, hats are
lighter, brims are broader than they
1 ave been for several years, and rib
bons are narrower. Soft light felts
as featured in the "crush" hat are
unusually popular. This hat can be
rolled up when not in use. Snap
brims still retain their appeal. And
rough felts of mixed colors are be
ing worn extensively.
One of the newest and most strik
ing hats for day time wear is the
iyrolean. A hat of this style is on
display down town. It is made of
medium gray rough felt, with a high,
sloping crown, which can be creased
like ordinary hats. A blue cord re
places the usual ribbon, in which is
stuck a bunch of blue, red, and
white and brown feathers.
For formal v/car, black hats remain
popular. And derbies, in particular,
are stylishly worn.
