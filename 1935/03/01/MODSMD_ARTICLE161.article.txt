# Raglan Jacket Models In Gabardine Are Spring Sports Demand
## 
### 
The new raglan sports jacket with
'its interesting "slope-shoulder" con
struction is one of the new styles
which have found favor among the
college men. This coat Is belted all
the way around and shows an in
verted box pleat up the center of the
back. Gabardine models with belted
backs and small knife pleats have re
turned somewhat to the fashion pic
ture.
Striplings seem to be the essential
feature both in shirts and cravats
for spring wear. For the college man
who likes a rough cut sport shirt,
the new "rugger" is suggested. Of
British origin, this latest of polo
shirts has the collar fastened by a
loop and a washable cravat. An
Egyptian cotton cloth shirt which
fits more loosely than most other
shirts of its type is preferred by
many.
Those girls who are anxious to
knit might be interested in the new
vogue of having knit cocktail dresses
; One very stunning one in a city store
is of a very lovely royal blue that it
' so popular this spring.
