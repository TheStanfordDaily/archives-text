# Men Pick Topcoat Over Wrap-Around For Spring Wear
## 
### 
The coming of spring means the
demise of wrap-arounds and over
coats as popular items in a man's
wardrobe.
In their stead comes the top
coat, in single-breasted models and
lightweight materials. Sufficient
warmth to keep one comfortable on
•00l evenings, yet not enough to
jverheat—that is the ideal.
The new materials will be either
shaggy, woolly, or silky in appear
ance. Tweeds, gabardines, and soft,
fleecy materials that po well with
rough-coated sports clothes and hard
weaves are being shown side uy siue.
The English Covert type, which is
in smooth-finished worsted, is also
very popular. It is impervious to
water and is an ideal all-around coat.
I Raglan sleeves and shoulders,
j which were features ot winter over-
I coats, again appear in the lighter
i spring models.

Another new fashion wrinkle is
I the manufacture of men's garters
| bearing the college colors on a well
executed leather shield.
