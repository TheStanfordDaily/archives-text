# Colors, Plaids, Checks, Patterns Appear in Newest Attire for Men
## Campus Men Put Stop to Rough Ideals Masculine Students Now just 'Smoothies' 
### CARL CREASEBREECHES 
Is Stanford really unsophisti
cated? Or are all the roughs casual
genii that never give a thought to
how they dress and act. In either
case, where does the "Stanford
Gentleman," held so dear by ihe
administration, fit in? Granted, a ge
nius may be a gentleman, but so
phistication is the primary requisite
of the gentry.
We can avoid an endless argument
on the definition of sophistication by
side-stepping the issue. It is a safe
assumption that the great majority
of Stanford students come from good
homes. Undoubtedly they all were
schooled in the use of the knife and
fork at some remote period of their
lives. Their mothers probably did
not send them to Sunday school in
overalls, nor were they sent to high
school in bedroom slippers.
Creature of Habit
The rough is a creature of haÂ£>it,
led into his ways by the hero wor
ship of his freshman days. After a
year or so, of ( course, it is quite na
tural to forget that in other places
people wear ties on week days,
change shirts occasionally, and do
not wear white shoes in the dead of
winter.
To be truly casual is fine. If there
ever was a person who went stag to
a dance in a sweat shirt and dunga
rees because he really didn't care
what people thought, and wanted
simply to hear the music, good. He
was a man of great moral courage,
but he would look askance at the
people who usurp reputation by ap
pearing in outfits similar to his for
the sole purpose of being pointed to
as a "guy that don't care nuthin for
nuthin." Such action is the direct
antithesis of the casualty that the
rough is attempting to affect.
Tradition Changing
The recent freshmen have taken
things more or less in their own
hands and are hanging on to the
things that they have been accus
tomed to.
Many of the old roughs are glad
of the opportunity to change shirts
every now and then. The change is
coming about slowly, however.
Stanford is far from being consid
ered either a sophisticated or well
dressed campus, but it is on the
was.
The new men have of the last few
years have aroused new interest in
clothes. Take for example the num
ber of sport coats to be seen on the
campus today. True, they are gen
erally worn with an air of abandon
borrowed from the rough. That's a
good thing. After all. school is not a
fancy dress ball; neither is it a farm
hands' picnic.
