# Latest Lowdown for Men Emphasizes Detailed Modes

Checks and stripes are about even
money now. Almost anything,
whether overcoat or sox, is good in
checks. Stripes, because they pro
vide a better medium for display
ing color, have a slight edge in (he
less exposed articles of haberdash
ery.

In shirts blue and brown stripes
are probably the best for all-around
usage. The various styles of tab col
lar are quite good although the "but
ton-down collar" is th? logical type
for. campus wear. It provides a free
dom of motion not to be found in the
tab, and it has a certain amount of
the tab's dressiness.

Argyle plaids are the kings of the
sock world, if you have the price.
Recently the bright colored stripes
have filled the Argyles shoes quite
adequately and at a much more con
venient price to the buyer.

Fortunately, if for comfort's sake ,
alone, the hobnail-minded rough has !
begun to accept the suede and crepe
soled shoe. The Norwegian calf is j
the dress shoe that the man who |
values comfort and taste alike wears. !
The heavy Scotch grain, either wing
or box tip. is still by far the most
practical shoe for fall, autumn, or

early spring wear. There's a shoe that
can take it without, a flinch. Black
patent leather is still standard for
evening wear; although the ultra
smarts, of the West at least, prefer
the black smooth cap suede.

The scarf should be the most col
orful article of the ensemble. It
should tie the color harmony of all
ihe other articles together. The simp
lest solution is the many-colored
plaid. Plaid suggests Scotland and
woolens. For street and evening
wear, of course, one is not con
fronted with the "many colored"
problem to such an extent. Here the
less passionate silks are preferred.

To the local campus man slacks are
the most important article of cloth
ing, this considered from the stand
point of taste, of course, not protec
tion. We assume that such considera
tion is practically universal. Brown
and gray are customary and quite
logically so. Checks are very good in
cheviot, flannels, harris tweed and in
fact almost anything. Gabardine
slacks provide endless opportunity
for good color harmony. They are
slightly more expensive, but, if you
believe in keeping a crease in your
pants and treating them rough, any
way, gabardines are economy.
