# Masquers Read Three Farm- Written Plays
## "Bread and Honey" Given Greatest Praise 
### Henry Brill 
Masquers, women's honorary dra
matic society, delved into local tal
, ent last night when it read three
! original one-act plays in the Little
Theatre. The plays, written by Stan
ford students, were selected by a
board of English department pro-
J fessors.
Honors went to James Benet's
I "Bread and Honey," which con
' cerncd itself with the amorous
intrigues and romantic cavortings
of members of the blood royal.
But plot was secondary to the
witty and humorous dialogue,
which seemed, to some extent, to
reflect the styles of Fercnc Mol
nar and Noel Coward.
Caroline Houseman, as the petu
lant princess, gave the outstanding
performance of the evening. Jean
Albertson made a stately queen and
| Dick Dawson was entertaining as
! Egbert, the princely suitor. His air
| of vague detachment, however, was
| a little too remindful of Hugh Her
bert for the drama's sophisticated
j setting.
"Twelve Decide," by Norman
, Stines, was an unusual one-act
j study. The scene is a jury room,
with the actors trying to rcach a
jverdici. The dialogue discloses how
i bias and prejudice and the workings
iof group psychology influence (he
i operation of our jury system. The
J result was interesting, but somewhat,
j rough as characters and lines and
| situation sometimes lost pace with
each other and by becoming incon
sistent left the rather heavy theme
i suspended in mid-air. Frank
O'Neil, Bob Dwan, Paul Crary, and
Fritzi-Belh Bowman were some of
the stars reading in this play.
The third play was "Miss Gundlc
Goes Out," by Dorothy Ellis. A few
good lines failed to redeem the
whole. Characterizations were not
smoothly drawn, motivation for lines
and action was poor, and t he plot was
a much over-used dramatic trick.
Virginia Swafford, as the secretarial
Cinderella, was the play's sole inter
est. Such talented actors as Neal
Berry, Annelics Morgan, Robert
Moore, and Phyllis Boothe were
, wasted.
