# 'American' Dinner Coats Are Popular

### 
When Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., came
back from London three years ago
with a mess jacket he had the long
sought solution to the summer form
al problem.
His was of the type known as the
'Monte Carlo." It consisted of the
ihort . white jacket, a colored cum
berund or sash, and black trousers.
Since that time the American, and
consequently more practical dinner
jacket has been developed. This
style is rapidly replacing the Monte
Carlo. It was primarily a while
double breasted shawl collar coat
with the same black trousers. The
cumberbund was replaced by the
white vest.
This season the dinner jacket is
undoubtedly to be preferred. An
innovation which will undoubtedly
find great favor is the ochre coat in
stead of the white.
