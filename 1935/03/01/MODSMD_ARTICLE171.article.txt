Every wardrobe will have its suit,
and every suit needs a few changes
of scarfs. Whether you choose a
solid color scarf or a brilliantly
printed one, you will want either
taffeta, acetate, pique, or one of the
many novelty silks.
By all means, have an extensive
neckwear wardrobe this spring, in
cluding collar and cuff sets, as well
as scarfs. There are so many ways
to vary a wardrobe with these novel
ties, that they are a worthwhile
investment.
