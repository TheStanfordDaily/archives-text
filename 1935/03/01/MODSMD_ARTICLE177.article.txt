# Daily Reviews First Fashion Edition of '32
## 
### Suzanne Hammond 
The Daily started its practice of
publishing a fashion edition in the
winter of 1932—February 25, to be
exact — when Willis Sullivan was
editor ol the paper. The only mem
ber of The Daily's present staff who
worked on that edition is Bob Jones,
now associate editor.
On first glancing at the ads and
illustrations it would seem that there
are few changes in styles since that
date, but on closer observation sev
eral startling transitions are notice
able. Among these, the most blatant
are the large ads found on page
after page of this first edition boost
ing mesh stockings, hats, hankies—
in iact everything at that date seem
ed to carry out the fish-net idea.
Formats Quaint
Another great change since that
date is seen in the field of sweaters.
At that time low neck sweaters in
very ornate designs were advocated,
and practically all were made in open
work patterns.
The headline on a feature about
spring formats read, "New Formals
Both Quaint and Worldly," the story
went on to tell that cape shoulders
and cape sleeves would compensate
for a new decolletage. Another note
along this line was the fact that "a
"frery daring style" had been devel
oped which consisted of a more con
servative version of our popular
halter neck style.
High Heels Stressed
Although in this edition sandals
consisting ol practically nothing but
straps were first mentioned as a pos
sibility for summer wear, emphasis
was laid on high heels rather than
the flat ones so popular this season.
And way down' at the bottom of a
page, in a very small filler, mention
was made that slacks might be worn
at the beach during the following
summer.
