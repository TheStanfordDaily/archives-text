The latest thing in hasher's clothes
is Cave—he never gets to work on
time.
There is a new synthesis in hash
ing costumery this season. At least,
I think it's a synthesis- it may be an '
apotheosis, however.
There should be a touch of spring
in the haberdashery, and a dash of
Boullion on the cuff.
Knowing, as 1 do, the heart and
soul of the Hashers' Trust, I can say
i that there is nothing that is closer to
their hearts than a dirty shirt.
The scheme of the ensemble should
include a bit of finery—a little bit of
slimsy whimsy, perhaps. If there is
a demand for dainty, feminine, frilly
i things, this should be carried out at
I the bottom of the coat and should be
, sung to the tune of "Don't Be Afray
ed to Tell Your Housemother."
Fawn color is the coming thing in
hasher's wear this spring, while corn
ing still later is a dark grey, while |
; finally, when the color gets so dark '
that you can't tell the coat from the
hasher, it would be advisable, per
■ haps, to pry them apart and send the
coat to the laundry. If this is im
practical, it is best to send the hasher
! along, too—that's the laundry's tough 1
f luck.
1 con definitely say that black '
shoe's are going out, while socks are
j slipping.
