Midnight blue tuxedos will be re
placing the traditional black thus

men's fashion world, as color begins
to win its way into the most sedate

Double-breasted fronts with shawl
collar replacing the usual "peak"
model and pleated peg top trousers

Comfort is the by-word among
formal fashion stylists. The new
tuxes are tailored with long-roll
j lapel following through almost to
the waist and low coat buttons. Soft
i pleated bosom shirts may replace
the stiff models as summer nears.
Now collars have been designed
i for greater ease. The regular Host
design is being replaced by the Fal

j wider wing.

eastern formal styles where grey
tuxedos and tux ensembles consist

black trousers and blue jackets with
black trousers are readily seen.

| campuses again this year but the
I constant drift toward tails has been
seen in the East and the more for
mal coats will probably take a firmer
hold on the Pacific Coast within the
' next few years.
