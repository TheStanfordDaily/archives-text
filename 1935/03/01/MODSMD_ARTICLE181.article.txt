# Men Disagree About Women's Quad Dress
## Majority Show Dislike of Red Fingernails; Socks Scored 
### 
When asked, "What don't you like
to see Stanford women wearing on
the Quad?" and "Do you think the
average Stanford woman is well
dressed?" prominent campus men
gave a gre.tl diversity of opinions.
Marvie Kahn, A.S.S.U. president,
was very liberal-minded, his only
aversion # being bobby socks. He was
also very generous in his rating of
Stanford women in general, saying
that he thought the majority were
well dressed.
Grayson (jives View
Bobby Grayson, ail-American
football player, was not very vol
uble on the subject. When asked
whether he approved of socks on the
Quad, he replied, "No, I certainly
don't." He wasn't quite certain of
his preference for low or high heeled
shoes — "Depends on the girl," ho
said. Likes sweaters and skirts for
school-wear ("you .bet"), thinks
Stanfoid women are very well
dressed, have good taste, and are
conservative.
Gordy Steedman, editor of the
Chaparral, refused to make a state
ment but said that his principal ob
jections in the line of women's Quad
wear wore bathing sails and
crutches. Following this comment 1 e
went on to enumerate high heels,
slave bracelets, fur coats, and hats
that seem to be stuck on with post
age stamps among his dislikes. Fi
nally, and most emphatically, he
said, "I wince when reminded of
gory red nail polishes!"
Trioio Likes Blondes
Jimmy Trioio, senior class* presi
dent, likes high heels, attractive
make-up—rouge and mascara —scar-
let. nail polish, and peroxided hair
on occasion. He also saw a silver
lacquered coiffuie once upon a time,
and liked it very much. Footnote
(hy XYZ) —he has a predilection for
blondes.
Kcitn Topping, football and bas
ketball star, answered, "The bane of
the Stanford campus is low-heeled
shoes. They look too dumpy, most
girls are short anyway, so why em
phasize it? High heels make the legs
look longer and more shapely."
Topping dislikes seeing women on
the Quad wearing red, "partly be
cause they don't, look good in it
anyway, and because there is foo
much red around with so many
'thick-skulled' athletes sporting red
sweaters." He approves of softer
colors, likes shirts and sweaters,
particularly mannish skirts with
sweaters worn over them, and he
dislikes ankle socks. Thinks the
average Stanford woman is well
dressed, though he thinks she must
have to get up at 6 o'clock to make
her toilette.
Never Sees Women
Jimmy Benet, president of Sword
and Sandals, said, "I never look at
women. Women's wearing apparel is
of the utmost indifference to me, and
I don't see how I can be expected to
pass judgment on it, but if red finger
nails are to be considered wearing
apparel, God knows I hate 'em!"
Waddy White, second term Men's
Councilman, commented that Stan
ford women are much too smooth,
and should have more of the qualities
ol the traditional rough. In answer
to the second question, he replied
that most of the Stanford women arc
"much too well dressed."

look longer and more shapely."
Topping dislikes seeing women on
the Quad wearing red, "partly be
cause they don't, look good in it
anyway, and because there is foo
much red around with so many
'thick-skulled' athletes sporting red
sweaters." He approves of softer
colors, likes shirts and sweaters,
particularly mannish skirts with
sweaters worn over them, and he
dislikes ankle socks. Thinks the
average Stanford woman is well
dressed, though he thinks she must
have to get up at 6 o'clock to make
her toilette.
Never Sees Women
Jimmy Benet, president of Sword
and Sandals, said, "I never look at
women. Women's wearing apparel is
of the utmost indifference to me, and
I don't see how I can be expected to
pass judgment on it, but if red finger
nails are to be considered wearing
apparel, God knows I hate 'em!"
Waddy White, second term Men's
Councilman, commented that Stan
ford women are much too smooth,
and should have more of the qualities
ol the traditional rough. In answer
to the second question, he replied
that most of the Stanford women arc
"much too well dressed."
When asked, "What don't you like
to see Stanford women wearing on
the Quad?" and "Do you think the
average Stanford woman is well
dressed?" prominent campus men
gave a gre.tl diversity of opinions.
Marvie Kahn, A.S.S.U. president,
was very liberal-minded, his only
aversion # being bobby socks. He was
also very generous in his rating of
Stanford women in general, saying
that he thought the majority were
well dressed.
Grayson (jives View
Bobby Grayson, ail-American
football player, was not very vol
uble on the subject. When asked
whether he approved of socks on the
Quad, he replied, "No, I certainly
don't." He wasn't quite certain of
his preference for low or high heeled
shoes — "Depends on the girl," ho
said. Likes sweaters and skirts for
school-wear ("you .bet"), thinks
Stanfoid women are very well
dressed, have good taste, and are
conservative.
Gordy Steedman, editor of the
Chaparral, refused to make a state
ment but said that his principal ob
jections in the line of women's Quad
wear wore bathing sails and
crutches. Following this comment 1 e
went on to enumerate high heels,
slave bracelets, fur coats, and hats
that seem to be stuck on with post
age stamps among his dislikes. Fi
nally, and most emphatically, he
said, "I wince when reminded of
gory red nail polishes!"
Trioio Likes Blondes
Jimmy Trioio, senior class* presi
dent, likes high heels, attractive
make-up—rouge and mascara —scar-
let. nail polish, and peroxided hair
on occasion. He also saw a silver
lacquered coiffuie once upon a time,
and liked it very much. Footnote
(hy XYZ) —he has a predilection for
blondes.
Kcitn Topping, football and bas
ketball star, answered, "The bane of
the Stanford campus is low-heeled
shoes. They look too dumpy, most
girls are short anyway, so why em
phasize it? High heels make the legs
look longer and more shapely."
