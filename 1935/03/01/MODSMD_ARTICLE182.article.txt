# Shoes Get Frivolous, Coy for Spring Wear
## 
### 
There is going to be a complete
transition in milady's shoe mode this
spring, bringing back a frivolity, a
coyness, and individuality that has
not been with us in years. Fashions
in footwear are going to be light in
spirit, and gay in appearance.
This inspiration is the result of
research into all periods of history,
taking from each inspiration for
definitely distinctive town costumes,
cocktail modes, and evening wear.
This year has become so complex
that these who want the utmost in
individuality will have to pay for it!
