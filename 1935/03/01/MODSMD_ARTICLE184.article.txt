# Stockings Will Be Dark, Light in Hne
## Navy Blue Style Is Set by Princess Marina 
### 
When the lovely Princess Marina
tucked some navy blue stockings into
.her trousseau, she gave the fashion
centers a new romantic interest that
, has grown into the high fashion note
I of the season.
These stockings, worn only in the
sheerrst weight, are smartest in
complementing the all-blue tailored
costume although they can be very
feminine too. They are shown with
navy prints, and also will be used
occasionally as an accent color with
light costumes that have navy ac
, ctssories. Then there is a new metal
lic grey which is grand with the
many navy blue spring suits thar
have a violet cast.
After Easter the .skin tones will
come into their own, and here the
emphasis is on the two extremes—
the light and the dark. Nude shades
which would have been considered
an evening color last year are now
i correct for daytime wear. At *he
j other end of the • cale. a deep and
vibrant suntan is the choice for gay
"peasant" colors. Reports from
southern resorts acclaim ihe enor
mous success of these colors—bright
oranges, and rusts, bright greens,
bright blues, and the stockings to go
with these must have a definite char
acter—a warm "gypsy" vitality.
