# HATS TURN REGENCY

### 
The Regency mode finds its most
complete form of expression in
spring millinery, and it- was in this
phase of fashion that it first saw
much light. Even formal slippers
and sandals indicate the nineteenth
century mode of coquettishness in
footwear.
Lacing is one alternative for any
one tired of buttons. And it doesn't
require buttonholes.
