# Shirred-Back Sweaters Popular in Soft Hues
## 
### 
Sweaters, one of the "fundamental
constants" of men's wear, are blos
soming forth in new styles and colors
this year.
Shirred-back jacket models, with
slash pockets, ring side-buckles, and
leather buttons are much in evi
dence. Twin sweater sets also prom
ise to retain their popularity, but
only in the quieter and plainer
colors.
Colors, on the whole, are quieter.
Soft pastel shades in angora and
alpaca Australian wool are holding
sway. Both slip-over and coat models
are being shown in indistinct plaids
and checks. The trend has been to
add zest to the style in cut and tail
oring, colors being light tans and
blues, with practically invisible de
signs.
