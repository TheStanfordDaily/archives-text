# Cay Colors Feature This Spring's Skirts
## 
### 
Gay, bright colors will be for
new spring skirts—especially light
blue, white, coral, yellow, brown, and
<*rey. The darker shades will be re
served for the more formal wear.
The newest thing in skirts is but
tons —huge buttons. In this, type of
skirt the lpst button is left open.
There will be a definite contrast in
the jackets and skirts, one of the
most striking being a white skirt
worn with a bright geranium-red
coat.
No more split skirts, says "Dame
Fashion"—rather straight line skii":■
with no plaits. The major materials
will be flannel and wool-crepe.
Length this spring is twelve inches
from the floor.
