# CAPES MODISH
## 
### 
One of the very smartest additions
to the* new tailored suits are silver
fox and sables or their counterpart.
Another new note is the hip length
cape, preferably black caracul, which
adds a dashing romantic air to any
wearer, and is taking the place of
all other types for the time at least.
