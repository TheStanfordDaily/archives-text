# Plainness Proves Keynote in Achieving Outstanding, Unique Wearing Apparel
## 
### 
The keynote of this season's fash
ions is "springtime simplicity,"
something one should always keep
in mind if the object in view is
achieving smartness.
Tills season, as never before, in
dividual taste may be given full lee
way in the matter of dress. In former
years, though not so much so lately,
smartness was dictated by one or
two dominant styles which one had
to wear to the exclusion of individ
ualism. «
Variety in Coats
Even in fur coats, this year, there
is as wide a range as in other ar
ticles of apparel. This variety is
somewhat of an innovation, as we
may see by looking back on the
styles of a few years ago.
Fur coats range from a very short
bolero to the 45-inch length, and
>rom the straight-lined boxy sil
houette to extreme flares. Skins
vary widely, also, including fiat cara
culs, kid caraculs, American broad
ail, mink, and weasel. The colors
are mostly black and warm brown,
although some furriers are showing
quite a bit of may, because gray and
navy blue will probably be one of
the season's leading color combina
tions.
Sleeves Express
The sleeve is the medium for ex
pression of style novelty this spring.
To accent interesting lines and to
sharply outline the silhouette, over
lapping seams will be used. Much
emphasis, also, wili be placed upon
skin working and details.
The waistline cape, usually in
black cau.cul, and very quaint and
youthful, will probably be a favorite
during the first part of the season,
along will the new "stroller"
length.
Light fabrics woven into new com
binations in line are the offering of
i lie season in foot toggery. This
model is closed with a zipper and
