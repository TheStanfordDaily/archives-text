# Tennis Courts See Varieties in Shorts
## 
### 
Shorts are going on the tennis
courts this spring in a new variety of
cloths and colors. Sandeze cloth,
which is a crinkly unbleached mus
lin, in gold, green, burnt orange,
dusky yellow, blue, scarlet red, and
white make up a variety of tennis
outfits. Some have pleated shorts,
sport skirts, and button-down-the
front skirts. Buttons arc mostly large
and wooden triangles, squares,
circles, in everything from a natural
color to deep ebony.
Some outfits have plain shorts,
bra-halter nevk tops tied with
braided cord, and coats either long
loose sleeved, or short almost sleeve
less jackets.
