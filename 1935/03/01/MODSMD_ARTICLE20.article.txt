### Mort D'Eveiyn 
With the second place in the coast
j conference undoubtedly going to the
winner, Coach John Bunn's Indian
j five will meet Nibs Price's Califor-
I nia quintet in the Harmon gymna
j sium in Berkeley tomorrow night in
i the season's v/indup.
In Los Angeles the Trojans meet
i the Bruins in the other conference
game. If the Trojans, overwhelming
favorites, win the second place po
sition will be open to the winner of
the California-Stanford game.
Final Game With Cal
Tomorrow's meeting will be the
fourth of the year for the Indians
j and the Bears, California having won
j the first two and the Indians sur
prising 10 days ago to take the third.
A second win over California within
| the season would open a new era
j in the history of Stanford basketball.

Despite tradition, the Indian will
enter tomorrow's game as slight fa
vorites, becausc of two victories over
U.C.L.A. last week-end while the
Bears were taking two lickings from
the Trojans.
Bunn will probably start the same
five that defeated the Bears in the
last game, due to the return of Keith
Topping. Appax'ently fully recovered
from a recent back injury, Topping
was able to display his usual form
in scrimmage last night, for the first
time within a week.
Anderson To Start
Ame Anderson is the favorite to
start at the other forward position
with Rod Bost. Howell Turner re
placed Anderson in the second Bruin
game last Saturday night, but has
been working out at the center po
sition this week due to the absence
of Topping.
Nibs Price will send his usual five
out on the floor for California, in
cluding Jack Kopke and Roy Olsen
or Dave Luce, forwards; Captain
Dave Meek, center; and Bob Herwig
and Bob Feiling, guards.
