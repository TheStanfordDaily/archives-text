# Aged Jurist Seriously III
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 28 (/P). -
Fear for the life of former Justice
Oliver Wendell Holmes was evi
denced today with the use of oxygen
to combat the ravages of illness.
Three tanks of the life prolonging
gas were taken into his residence a
short while after Dr. Thomas A.
Claytor announced:
"The Justice is ill and at his age
all illness is serious."
The Justice's next birthday is
March 8. when he will be 94.
The men who delivered the oxy
gen emerged from the residence
minutes later bearing several empty
tanks, which had been delivered
there on Tuesday.
Around the Supreme Court, where
Mr. Holmes served 29 years until his
retirement in January, 1932, it was
understood he was suffering with
bronchial pneumonia, with which
he was stricken Saturday.
