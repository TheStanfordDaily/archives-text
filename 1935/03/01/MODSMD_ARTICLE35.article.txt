# College Strikes: Are They Self-Defeating?
## 
### 
The latest fad in strikes has made its ap
pearance. Not content with longshoremen's
strikes or even textile and niotorinen's strikes,
the League for Industrial Democracy has
planned a series of protests during April in
colleges all over the country.
On the face of it, the whole thing seems
absurd. After looking into all the aspects,
conviction grows that it not only seems ab
surd but is actually a ridiculous move, and
one that cannot possibly lead to a logical end.
Why are students who belong to the League
for Industrial Democracy going to strike?
They will rise to protest Fascism, and lo dis
approve of armed warfare. Well and good.
Their motives are sincere, and their purpose
is a laudable one. But the means lo achieve
Ihcir end is an unfortunate accident.
After all, strikes arc nothing new in this
country. To create more than a ripple, a strike
miisl stand for something, have some signifi
cance. This protest will do neither. What
it will undoubtedly do is attract much pub
licity, most of it unfavorable.
Last year, such protest strikes were held in
the Eastern colleges, led principally by Co
lumbia I'niversitv and the College of the City
of New York. Much hard feeling was aroused,
and entire student bodies walked out. Hut not
really tangible aim was realized. This
year the plan is to spread these protest strikes
all over I he country, penetrating all the campi,
arousing student fervor.
The idea will not work. 'I hose students who
lead such movements are a passionate minor
ity. They hope to gain esteem and enlist thou
sands of students lo their cause. Hut a strike
will not achieve such a goal. On the other
hand il will serve to discredit Ihcir cause and
lead lo scorn for the most part. There is
plenty of evidence lo prove this.
Incidents on the colleges of the coast last
fall proved that student uprisings arc not
popular, nor are they a part of American cam
pus life. Hadical student leaders at U.C.L.A.,
al the University of California in Berkeley,
and even in the junior colleges, received
nothing for tliir zeal but well-directed eggs,
thrown at Iheni by their fellow students. Men
and women in universities are fundamentally
conservative. They wish to make up their
own minds as to their beliefs, and a strike will
not serve lo hasten Ihe process along.
In the recent college polls as to questions
of war and peace, huge majorities indicate
that students arc internationally minded, and
I hat they desire peace. These are the healthy
and sane ways of arriving at an estimate of
what the college student believes. Hut pro
tests are only a feeble attempt to form student
opinion, and they usually boomerang directly
back into Ihe faces of those who initiate them.
Across the bay in Berkeley, the university
leaders of the National Students League and
Hie League for Industrial Democracy have an
nounced a one-hour demonstration for April
12, to protest war and Fascism. Their dean
of undergraduates has announced that Ihe
university authorities will "let it lake its
natural course," referring lo the proposed
demonstration. Hut what is "its natural
course "
Here on Ihe Farm, this same League for
Industrial Democracy has considered the situ
ation and rejected any proposals of a strike.
Wisely they see the improbability of such a
move, and that the end to be gained from any
such demonstration is obscure if not impos
sible.
Instead, seven campus groups have peti
tioned for an assembly, to be kept free of
propaganda, where campus and outside
speakers may present facts concerning peace,
and the responsibilities of students in Inter
national Helations. Instead of protest demon
strations, other colleges could well emulate
this idea, and judiciously put across their
ideas, rather than by the very crude methods
ol simply walking out of their classrooms, in
Ihe hopes of thus annihilating both Ihe bogeys
of War and Fascism.

Across the bay in Berkeley, the university
leaders of the National Students League and
Hie League for Industrial Democracy have an
nounced a one-hour demonstration for April
12, to protest war and Fascism. Their dean
of undergraduates has announced that Ihe
university authorities will "let it lake its
natural course," referring lo the proposed
demonstration. Hut what is "its natural
course "
Here on Ihe Farm, this same League for
Industrial Democracy has considered the situ
ation and rejected any proposals of a strike.
Wisely they see the improbability of such a
move, and that the end to be gained from any
such demonstration is obscure if not impos
sible.
Instead, seven campus groups have peti
tioned for an assembly, to be kept free of
propaganda, where campus and outside
speakers may present facts concerning peace,
and the responsibilities of students in Inter
national Helations. Instead of protest demon
strations, other colleges could well emulate
this idea, and judiciously put across their
ideas, rather than by the very crude methods
ol simply walking out of their classrooms, in
Ihe hopes of thus annihilating both Ihe bogeys
of War and Fascism.
The latest fad in strikes has made its ap
pearance. Not content with longshoremen's
strikes or even textile and niotorinen's strikes,
the League for Industrial Democracy has
planned a series of protests during April in
colleges all over the country.
On the face of it, the whole thing seems
absurd. After looking into all the aspects,
conviction grows that it not only seems ab
surd but is actually a ridiculous move, and
one that cannot possibly lead to a logical end.
Why are students who belong to the League
for Industrial Democracy going to strike?
They will rise to protest Fascism, and lo dis
approve of armed warfare. Well and good.
Their motives are sincere, and their purpose
is a laudable one. But the means lo achieve
Ihcir end is an unfortunate accident.
After all, strikes arc nothing new in this
country. To create more than a ripple, a strike
miisl stand for something, have some signifi
cance. This protest will do neither. What
it will undoubtedly do is attract much pub
licity, most of it unfavorable.
Last year, such protest strikes were held in
the Eastern colleges, led principally by Co
lumbia I'niversitv and the College of the City
of New York. Much hard feeling was aroused,
and entire student bodies walked out. Hut not
really tangible aim was realized. This
year the plan is to spread these protest strikes
all over I he country, penetrating all the campi,
arousing student fervor.
