# Alumni on the Campus
## 
### 
Alumni, live hundred or more of them, will
come back to the campus this week-end to
renew old acquaintances and to put them
selves back in touch with Ihe academic world.
Originated by the class of IJMO, the con
ference lias proved itself a practical success
in the three years it has been held. More than
400 graduates from years back attended the
meeting held last,year, and indications are
that an even larger group will return to the
Quad this week.
The event has conclusively proved its value,
and its continuance in years to come is as
sured by its reception by members of the
alumni group. Contact with the University
after graduation sometimes is more valuable
lo a graduate than his student days, due to
the belter appreciation of relative values
which a few years in the outside world give.
