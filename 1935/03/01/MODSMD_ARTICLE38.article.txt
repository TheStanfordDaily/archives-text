The smash-up of the Macon a few miles ofi Point
Sur has focused the interest of the public once more
on the actual hazards of flying, and raised the inquiry
as to what steps the government is taking to protect
air-passengers from hazards of faulty construction in
aircraft.
Aeronautics Professor W. F. Durand enumerates a
few precautions now taken by the federal government
to lessen the dangers of air-travel:
"Greater safety and reliability of service are two
objectives that the government watches with great care
in exercising control over transport flying.
"Conditions involving hazards to safety may arise
from structural weakness of the plane, faulty aero
dynamic characteristics, unreliability in operation of
the engine, unfavorable weather conditions, and lack of
skill or good judgment on the part of the pilot.
"To guard against the first of these, structural weak
ness, the United States law requires that every plane
in the service of the public shall be based on a design
of structure which has been submitted to the skilled
experts of the aeronautics branch of the department of
commerce, for the service contemplated, and which has
been fully approved by them.
"Researches in the aerodynamics of flight ear
ned on at the laboratory of the national advisory
committee for aeronatucs at Langley Field, Vir
ginia, has developed an enormous fund of inform," -
tion concerning the forces to which an airplane is
subject in flight—a fund so extended that for any
normal proposed condition of service, the loads and
stresses to which the structure will he subjected can
be foretold with an accuracy quite comparable to
that prevailing in other domains of engineering
practice.
"Rigid tests and inspections must be made before the
government will pass on the acceptability of an engine
for commercial airplane service. A type engine repre
senting the design must be approved by United States
experts, as well as pass an operative test of fifty hours,
before it can be used for commercial transport purposes.
"In overcoming hazards due to adverse weather
conditions, the United States weather service, in coop
eration with the air-transport companies, furnishes
the means for radio broadcasts of weather conditions
along flying routes, so that a pilot is always informed
regarding the weather to be anticipated along the route
which he is to fly. Radio beacons greatly reduce the
hazards of blind flying.
"The United States law is most exacting as to
the training of transport pilots. Before a pilot may
present himself for examination and an air-trms
port license, previous experience as a pilot com
prising not less than 1200 hours during the preced
ing eight years, of which at least 500 must have
been cross country flying, and at least 75 at night
and 50 cross-country over lighted ojrways. Periodic
tests are then required of him after obtaining his
license.
"Demands for higher speeds of air-travel have of
course been coupled with that of no resultant sacrifice
of safety and reliability. In general these are har
monious requirements, since greater engine power,
other elements relating to safety being equal, will mean
greater ability to cope with untoward weather condi
tions, or other unexpected or abnormal incidents of
any character that may arise.
"Better knowledge still is needed regarding the
stresses upon the c'omplex structure of modern aircraft
under unusual and accidental conditions. New mater
ials remain to be investigated; new alloys, new combi
nations which shall give adequate strength with the
saving of weight, or longer life, or both.
"Air-transport is indeed a lusty infant making.its
way strongly in a domain of human activity in compe
tition with other agencies and under conditions which
dvmand the largest possible guarantees of safety, relia
bility and efficiency," concludes Professor Durand.
"Here as elsewhere, only constant study, pitiless self
criticism and continued advance in all fundamental
requirements will meet the expectations oj the public
which air-transport seeks to serve."

"Air-transport is indeed a lusty infant making.its
way strongly in a domain of human activity in compe
tition with other agencies and under conditions which
dvmand the largest possible guarantees of safety, relia

The smash-up of the Macon a few miles ofi Point
Sur has focused the interest of the public once more
on the actual hazards of flying, and raised the inquiry
as to what steps the government is taking to protect
air-passengers from hazards of faulty construction in
aircraft.
Aeronautics Professor W. F. Durand enumerates a
few precautions now taken by the federal government
to lessen the dangers of air-travel:
"Greater safety and reliability of service are two
objectives that the government watches with great care
in exercising control over transport flying.
"Conditions involving hazards to safety may arise
from structural weakness of the plane, faulty aero
dynamic characteristics, unreliability in operation of
the engine, unfavorable weather conditions, and lack of
skill or good judgment on the part of the pilot.
"To guard against the first of these, structural weak
ness, the United States law requires that every plane
in the service of the public shall be based on a design
of structure which has been submitted to the skilled
experts of the aeronautics branch of the department of
commerce, for the service contemplated, and which has
been fully approved by them.
"Researches in the aerodynamics of flight ear
ned on at the laboratory of the national advisory
committee for aeronatucs at Langley Field, Vir
ginia, has developed an enormous fund of inform," -
tion concerning the forces to which an airplane is
subject in flight—a fund so extended that for any
normal proposed condition of service, the loads and
stresses to which the structure will he subjected can
be foretold with an accuracy quite comparable to
that prevailing in other domains of engineering
practice.
"Rigid tests and inspections must be made before the
government will pass on the acceptability of an engine
for commercial airplane service. A type engine repre
senting the design must be approved by United States
experts, as well as pass an operative test of fifty hours,
before it can be used for commercial transport purposes.
"In overcoming hazards due to adverse weather
conditions, the United States weather service, in coop
eration with the air-transport companies, furnishes
the means for radio broadcasts of weather conditions
along flying routes, so that a pilot is always informed
regarding the weather to be anticipated along the route
which he is to fly. Radio beacons greatly reduce the
hazards of blind flying.
"The United States law is most exacting as to
the training of transport pilots. Before a pilot may
present himself for examination and an air-trms
port license, previous experience as a pilot com
prising not less than 1200 hours during the preced
ing eight years, of which at least 500 must have
been cross country flying, and at least 75 at night
