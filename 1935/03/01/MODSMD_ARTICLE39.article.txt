# A Toast to Townsend
## 
### 
CUM GRANO SALIS
Cheer up. Grandma! Don't you cry!
You'll wear diamonds by and by.
When the Townsend Plan goes through
How we all shall envy you!
Uncle Sam has money-mills
Made to grind out brand new bills.
He will champion your cause,
With his Old-Age pension laws.
You will find tht' poor relations
Sticking like the League of Nations.
No more worry over bills,
Butcher's duns or doctor's pills,
No more panic over rent,
Leave that to the government.
You can soar away full-fledged,
With the over-|jpvileged.
Dine on squab and caviar,
Sport a stream-line motor-car.
When the blizzards "bliz" a bit,
Off to Palm Beach gaily flit.
Lead a life of pleasure bent,
But you must spend every cent!
Whoopee! Grandma! Ktep alive!
Life be-dns at SIXTY-KTVF.!
