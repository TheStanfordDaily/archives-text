Mr. and Mrs. Oliver CHsfcn ot Spangle, Wash., saw a full-grown doe
resting on the ice cf Loon lake and when they approached her she
did not move; but struggled when they attempted to pet her. They
discovered the deer was frozen fast. It was believed she had exhausted
herself trying to gain solid footing, and then fell. The Olsons freed
the animal. The doe ran away as they reached shore with her. (Asso
