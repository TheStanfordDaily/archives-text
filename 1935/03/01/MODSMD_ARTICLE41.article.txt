The- Editor, Sir:
In June I graduate. Ever since I j
; have been in Stanford I have had !
| this gripe on my spleen and now I
: must get it off.
Why is it that the Union Cellar,
with almost a Campus monopoly on i
j food, hashers who are paid in meals. I
; the means of buying in huge lots, |
and no advertising expenses, charges j
I such exhorbitant and ruthless prices I
j for a meal? It is impossible to get |
[anything fit to hold on one's stomach
; for less than 60 to 75 cents. Night
j after night the only 50-cent entry
lis Salisbury steak (just plain reek
| ing hamburger to us) end everything
i else goes up-up. Breakfast and
lunch you go away half starved after
; a 40-cent meal and wholly starved
! after anything less. Why these high
prices and scanty portions when
'downtown dives can stuff your gut
j for 30 and 40 cents at dinner and 15
■ to 25 cents for breakfast and lunch?
i Why is it that certain creameries in >
1 Paly can shove a huge milkshake
I across the counter for 15 cents and
| a sandwich for a dime, while the
1 Cellar puts the shake in your glass
with an eye-dropper and soaked 15
< cents for a sandwich? Why is it that i
i5O per cent of the time the food
served here and at the men and
women's eating halls would gag a
: maggot or undernourish an amo
eba?
j Don't anyone reply to me that if I
l don't like it I can go some place else,
j I do go some place else but occa
sionally the pressure of time drives
I me into the blood-sucking Union and
when I leave it is only with the
greatest repugnance, anguish, and
hatred that I fork out for my check.
! As far as I am concerned the Union
i can dispose of its swill in the same
! manner in which the prisoners in-
I formed the Warden to dispose of his
pudding.
But—as long as we tolerate these
j things we are suckers! Am I alone in
my gripe?

ULPH PROTESTS AGAIN
The- Editor, Sir:
In June I graduate. Ever since I j
; have been in Stanford I have had !
| this gripe on my spleen and now I
: must get it off.
Why is it that the Union Cellar,
with almost a Campus monopoly on i
j food, hashers who are paid in meals. I
; the means of buying in huge lots, |
and no advertising expenses, charges j
I such exhorbitant and ruthless prices I
j for a meal? It is impossible to get |
[anything fit to hold on one's stomach
; for less than 60 to 75 cents. Night
j after night the only 50-cent entry
lis Salisbury steak (just plain reek
| ing hamburger to us) end everything
i else goes up-up. Breakfast and
lunch you go away half starved after
; a 40-cent meal and wholly starved
! after anything less. Why these high
prices and scanty portions when
'downtown dives can stuff your gut
j for 30 and 40 cents at dinner and 15
■ to 25 cents for breakfast and lunch?
