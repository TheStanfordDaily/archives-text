## 
### 
WASHINGTON. Feb. 28 (JP)â€”The
joint Senate and House move for re
peal of the law setting up the "pink
slip" publicity method for income
tax returns apparently collapsed

A Senate committee, in effect, told
a House committee that anything of
the kind must originate in the House
and probably would not get far in
the Senate.
