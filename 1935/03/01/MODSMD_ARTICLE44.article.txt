IDYLL IN IDAHO
POCATELLO, Idaho, Feb. 26.—1t
is just a whoop and a holler from
Ogden, Utah, up north to Pocatello.
Except that it is a triHe colder, and
lacks a Salt Lake, southern Idaho
is indistingui.shable from northern
Utah. Barrenness blends into more
barrenness.
Idahoans, like Utahans, and Cali
fornians, and apparently like the in
habitants of the whole of the civil
and uncivilized world are now suf
fering from "unusual weather." "Un
usual weather," like "hard times,"
seems to be the normal thing wher
ever you go. But Idahoans have not
yet completely mastered the Califor
nian's trick of calling roses by other
names. Natives here describe the
weather as "biting cold." We would
call it "delightfully crisp."
All politicians are at sometime in
their careers troubled by an itching
desire to belong to the other party.
This itch is particularly manifest
when "the other party" is in the sad
dle. I have at last found the man
who has contrived to straddle both
political horses at one and the same
time. That man runs both papers in
Pocatello- the morning Journal and
the afternoon Pocatello Tribune. In
the morning he writes stirring Dem
ocratic editorials. In the afternoon
he writes equally stirring Republi
can editorials. And those few people
who can tell the difference between
the two never seem to mind. Il is ;i
very neat business.
The moth-eaten remnants of the
once noble red man are housed just
outside of Pocatello on the Fort Hall
Indian Reservation. The Shoshones
and Bannocks who live there still
have their black hair and mongoloid
features of the "first Americans."
But when you take an Indian, stick
him in factory-made clothes and
drab wooden houses, he simply
ceases to be an Indian. The true
American (or at least the story-book
picture of the true American) dies
as he is Americanized. Without
swift ponies to lide, and woolly buf
falo to shoot, the local Indians are
as pitiable as sad-eyed St. Bernards
panting under the Southern Cali
fornia sun.
The young Indians are being edu
cated in up-to-date schools. They
are a little weak on arithmetic, but
their art work is unsurpassed.
Fourth-grade Indian kids draw
bucking horses that fairly kick them
selves off the page. Many of the
older Indians have become small
farmers and shepherds. Many have
soured on life in general, and the
white man in particular; they arc
rightfully suspicious and uncommu
nicative.
This is Idaho, famous for potatoes,
sheep, and Senator Borah.

P.S.—Today Rogers and I sang
with the Kiwanians, spoke over the
local radio station, and debated the
University of Idaho, Southern
Branch. A large audience paid noth
ing to get in and went out more

Indian Reservation. The Shoshones
and Bannocks who live there still
have their black hair and mongoloid
features of the "first Americans."
But when you take an Indian, stick
him in factory-made clothes and
drab wooden houses, he simply
ceases to be an Indian. The true
American (or at least the story-book
picture of the true American) dies
as he is Americanized. Without
swift ponies to lide, and woolly buf
falo to shoot, the local Indians are
as pitiable as sad-eyed St. Bernards
panting under the Southern Cali

The young Indians are being edu

are a little weak on arithmetic, but
their art work is unsurpassed.
Fourth-grade Indian kids draw
bucking horses that fairly kick them
selves off the page. Many of the
older Indians have become small
farmers and shepherds. Many have
soured on life in general, and the
white man in particular; they arc
rightfully suspicious and uncommu
nicative.

is just a whoop and a holler from
Ogden, Utah, up north to Pocatello.
Except that it is a triHe colder, and
lacks a Salt Lake, southern Idaho
is indistingui.shable from northern
Utah. Barrenness blends into more
barrenness.
Idahoans, like Utahans, and Cali
fornians, and apparently like the in
habitants of the whole of the civil
and uncivilized world are now suf
fering from "unusual weather." "Un
usual weather," like "hard times,"
seems to be the normal thing wher
ever you go. But Idahoans have not
yet completely mastered the Califor
nian's trick of calling roses by other
names. Natives here describe the
weather as "biting cold." We would
call it "delightfully crisp."
All politicians are at sometime in
their careers troubled by an itching
desire to belong to the other party.
This itch is particularly manifest
when "the other party" is in the sad
dle. I have at last found the man
who has contrived to straddle both
political horses at one and the same
time. That man runs both papers in
Pocatello- the morning Journal and
the afternoon Pocatello Tribune. In
the morning he writes stirring Dem
ocratic editorials. In the afternoon
he writes equally stirring Republi
can editorials. And those few people
who can tell the difference between
the two never seem to mind. Il is ;i
very neat business.
The moth-eaten remnants of the
