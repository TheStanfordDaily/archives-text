# COLLEGE TRAINED WELFARE WORKER IN GREAT DEMAND
## California Schools Report Openings Available In Social Held 
### 
Since increased emphasis has been
placed upon college training for
prospective social workers, demand
for graduates has been reported by
the two outstanding schools of so
cial work in the West.
The University of California at
Berkeley reports: "There has been a
much heavier demand for our grad
uates in social work than we have
been able to .supply. In our experi
ence, the largest demand at present
i:- in the field of public welfare, both
on the administrative side and in
case work. Next to this comes the de
mand for competent personnel for
medical social work."
I'.S.C. Reports Demands
The University of Southern Cali-
I inn.t says: "The demand for grad
uates of our School of Social Wel
fare was never greater than it is at
the present time. The need for
trained .social workers is steadily
increasing.
"Social work administration and
case work are the main fields where
the demands originate. The need for
men in the field of administration
and for women in the field of case
work are the two most important
factors to be stressed."
Jobs Offer Advancement
Jobs of this type, while not highly
remunerative to begin with, offer
possibilities of great progress and
advancement to an administrative
position, say school officials.
The Vocational Guidance Bureau
may be of assistance in establishing
contacts which lead to a position for
the student after graduation.
