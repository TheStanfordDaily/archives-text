# HANZLIK TELLS OF FATAL DRUG
## 
### 
Two suicides and two fatal poison
ings -that's the score of dinitrophe
nol, tissue-burning drug, against
women who place sylph-like figures
higher than their health, according
to Professor Paul J. Hanzlik, of the
Stanford Department of Pharmacol
ogy.
Chief constituent of certain patent
reducing medicines, dinitrophenol is
a compound that should be used
only under physician's advice, and
not in falsely advertised and labelled
panaceas that promise popularity
and menace life, Dr. Hanzlik indi
cated in his report to President Wil
bur.
He recommends legislation re
stricting the sale of dinitrophenol
much the same as those governing
the sale of narcotics and poisons.
Under present conditions, 'The
public is being encouraged to medi
cate itself with a potent drug, some
times dispensed secretly and without
proper diagnosis and medical super
vision, with resulting cases of poi
soning," Dr. Hanzlik declared.
Countless experiments in the uni
versity pharmacy have proved that
dinitrophenol cannot be used in
thyroid cases, though it can reduce
body weight in any condition.
