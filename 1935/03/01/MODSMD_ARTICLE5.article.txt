# CARD DEBATERS ARRIVE IN L.A. FOR U.S.C. TILT
## University of Utah Meet "Spiciest of Trip" 
### 
Arriving in Los Angeles today for
their debate with the University of
Southern California, Bill Rogers and
Dave Mellinkoff, with Bob Gros,
debate manager, prepare for the
major forensic clash of the western
team of the Stanford transcontinental
tour.
According to word received from
Mellinkoff, the debate with the
University of Utah which was held
Wednesday night at Salt Lake City
was the "spiciest debate of the trip."
Governor Henry H. Blood of Utah
presided before a large audience in
Kingsbury Hall on the Utah campus.
On their way to Los Angeles, the
three stopped over for several hours
to see Boulder Dam in southern Ne
vada yesterday.
The U.S.C. debate is billed as
the major debate on the Trojan
campus this season, and will be
held tonight in Govard flail with
Francis Lcderer, movie star and
peace advocate, presiding. Stanford
will uphold the negative <if the
arms and munitions question.
A letter to Debate Coach Lee
Chapin from Bob Grantier and
Packey McFarland who are now on
the Atlantic seaboard debating Harv
ard, Yale, and New York Univer
sity, reported that the Dartmouth
debate was "the high point of the
trip so far." The letter makes spe
cial mention of Dartmouth's hospi
tality.
The topic for the Dartmouth clash
was on collective bargaining, and
the meeting was held last Sunday
night. Stanford's policy that "de
bating tours are not barnstorming
trips in search for victories and de
cision prevailed. The debate was
held in "Oregon style" with no de
cision.
