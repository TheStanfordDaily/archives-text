# POST DEMANDS INVESTIGATION
## Emery Filings Found in Oil, Aviator Declares 
### 
NEW YORK, Fob. 28 (/P).— Wiley
Post was headed for New York late
today to discuss a possible federal
inquiry into his charge that some
one tampered with the engine-of his
airplane, the Winnie Mae, shortly
before last week's ill fated attempt
at a transcontinental substrato
sphere flight.
Alleges Sabotage
The round the world aviator, fly
ing here in another plane from Los
Angeles, landed at Kansas City and
there made his allegation that
nearly two pounds of steel filings
and powdered emery were placed in
the engine of the Winnie Mae.
As a result, he said, the engine
quickly became overheated and he
was forced to land less than an hour
after his take-off from Los Angeles.
Suspected Defect
An investigation is already under
way on the Coast, he said.
"Laboratory tests disclosed the
presence of the emery and the filings
in the oil," the aviator said. "I be
gan to suspect something was wrong
soon after I got ofl the ground at
Los Angeles, because the engine was
hotter than it had ever been before.
