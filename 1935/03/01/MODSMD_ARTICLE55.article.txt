# L.A. Fair Will Not Interfere With Bay City
## Students Will Take Part In Exposition 
### 
San Francisco will have a world's
â–  fail* despite any action that may be j
! taken by Los Angeles, it was learned
today, as Leland Cutler, chairman
j of the local exposition committee,
' was on his way south to confer with j
leading citizens there as to a pos- |
sible shelving of their plans.
Although primarily designed to
; commemorate completion of the
Golden Gate and San Francisco- ;
Oakland Bay bridges, the event will
be the first of its kind to make more
than a conventional appeal to college
| students, according to Stan Beau- 1
baire, chairman of the committee of
I university participation, and ex- ;
Daily editor.
"Demonstration of all kinds of
| college activities, including debat
i ing, sports, dramatics, and research
| will take a prominent place in the
j exposition programme," he declared
] today. 'In previous affairs, there
| was no direct interest for college
men and women. In 1938, however, ,
the importance of the university in j
the modern world will gain full rec
| ognition."
Students from nearly all major
I California colleges will be asked to
participate, according to plans. The 1
press of administrative work for .
college events and exhibits will J
! probably necessitate the employ- j
ment of 200 students from U.C. and :
Stanford, Beaubaire points out.
