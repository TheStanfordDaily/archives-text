# English Labor Leader Ruins Hitler's Stylists
## 
### 
LONDON, Feb. 28 (/P)—Styles,
politics and the press got all mixed
up today.
While the German Nazi propa
ganda ministry's style show was
thrown into an uproar as Miss Mon
ica Whately, labor leader, bitterly
assailed the German government, an
audience at another hotel saw with
surprise fashions derived from the
front pages of its favorite news
papers.
Miss Whatcly's harangue took the
audience, the seven tall, slim Ger
man mannequins—Hitler's ambassa
dresses of style—and the orchestra
completely by surprise.
One of the creeks in Tennessee has
black water six days a week and
clear on Sunday, due to the fact that
miners wash coal on every day but
the Sabbath.
