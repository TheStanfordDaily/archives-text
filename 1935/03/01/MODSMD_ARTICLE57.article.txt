Jane, 20 (left), and Elizabeth Du Bois, 23, plunged to their deaths
from a Paris-London plane near Upminster, England. The daughters
of the U. S. consul general at Naples were said to have been grief
stricken because two Royal Air Force flying officers were killed in an
air crash a short time before. (Associated Press Photo)
