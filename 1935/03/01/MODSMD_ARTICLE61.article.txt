### 
HONOLULU, Feb. 28 (/!»;. — A
of terrific rain, accompanied by
hail, a rare phenomenon in this
tropical setting, left six persons dead,
six reported missing and a variety of
damage on Oahu Island.
About six inches of rain fell in
down-town Honolulu yesterday ;
afternoon and lost night, while Dow
sett Highlands, a residential section
overlooking ihe city, experienced 14 j
inches. The heaviest fall, however, j
was registered at the Kamehameha
School, a mile and a quarter from I
the down-town district. The gauge
there showed 15.72 inches, nearly all
of which fell in six hours.
Troops Turn Out
United States Army troops, Na
tienal Guardsmen and citizen vol- j
unteers turned out when the sky |
cleared today and helped police re- |
pair damage and remove debris.
A Filipino and his two sens died
of burns and suffocation when their
house burned as an indirect result of 1
the storm. An unidentified body was 1
found lodged against a bridge on the
outskirts of the city. The other vie- 1
tims were women, one of whom was i
asphyxiated when a gas main burst.
The others drowned at Pearl City, >
near here.
Residents were returned to their '
homes today as water which filled
the roads emptied into the ocean.
Damage Not So Heavy
No official estimate of the damage '
was available, but Mayor Fred I
Wright said the loss to city and ;
county pioperty was about $150,000.
The Star Bulletin placed the prop
erty loss to stores and homes at j
$100,000. Crop damage apparently !
was comparatively light, as there was j
little wind, the element most feared j
by sugar cane growers. Some of the I
plantation owners welcomed the rain. |
Two families who stuck to their
homes until the last minute in the I
country section of Oahu Island nar
rowly escaped. They were rescued j
by a road gang, which rowed across j
a plantation covered with more than ,
six feet of water.
