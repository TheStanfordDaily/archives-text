# Varsity, Freshmen Swimmers To Meet Bears at Berkeley
## Close Contest Looms With Two Teams Appearing Evenly Matched 
### Horb Diamond 
The Card varsity and frosh mer
men journey to Berkeley tomorrow
afternoon to meet the California
swimmers in what promises to be
one of the most closely contested Big
Meets in the history of competition.
The program is. scheduled to be
gin at 2:30 o'clock in the gymnasium
pool for men.
Stanford's Captain Bob Foster is a
heavy favorite to win the breast
stroke event. California's Roy Siem
is rated to cop the honors in the
backstroke. Every other event on
the program is a toss-up. Close and
thrilling races should prove to be the
rule rather than the exception and
the unexpected "come through" per
formances are what will win the meet
for either squad.
Tie Considered Possible
Both Coaches Nort Thornton of
the Cards and A1 Dowden of the
Bears agree that a 42-42 tie will be
the most likely outcome of the
battle. The Indians will be fighting
every minute to maintain their rec
ord and add to their lengthy string
of wins, dating from 1917.
In the 400-yard relay the Indians
have consistently swum faster times,
but the Bears have never yet exerted
themselves in that particular event.
At practice, the Cards have done
3.48.5, which is a full second faster
than the highly touted Golden Gate
J. C. squad found it necessary to
swim when they downed Stanford
in-that event several weeks ago.
Dowden has indicated that he prac
tically concedes the event to the In
dians, as the Cal boys have done no
better than 3.52 all season. This
event should be a weighty factor in
determining the final score.
Captain Foster Favored
In the 200-yard breast stroke,
Captain Foster of Stanford has al
ready broken his own record in
practice and should set a new coast
mark.
Siem of California is favored in
the 150-yard back stroke, but Fit
ting of the Cards could press him
closely. Davis of U.C. is favored in
the 50-yard free-style but Scatena
and Sutherland might do the unex
pected. A great contest is looked for
when Clemo and Peterson of Stan
ford tangle with Dozier from Cal in
the 440-yard free.
The 100-yard free-style will prob
ably also prove a thriller with "Big"
Smith and Davis, both of U.C., fenc
ing Kuhn and Dogle from the Farm.
Diving should be a sensational dual
exhibition between Kuhns, U.C., and
Boothe, Stanford. The 220-yard free
Is expected to see Hoover and Kuhn,
Stanford, and Smith and Lawrence,
Cal, neck and neck to the finish.
Relay May Be Decisive
The meet may depend entirely
upon the outcome of the 300-yard
medley relay. This is definitely a
toss-up. California should gain in
the backstroke, Captain Foster may
regain the lead in breast stroking,
and Scatena, Stanford, and Davis,
U.C., are expected to fight it out in
the free style.
The frosh meet will be run off in
connection with the varsity. The
events are swim alternately. Little
is known of the Cal frosh. They
are believed to be weak, however, as
they have lost all of their meets this
season.
Smith Is Frosh Leader
Warren Smith, star breast stroker,
was elected Captain of the Card
yearlings. He has done 2.42.5 in the
breast stroke and will face the Bear
frosh's one great star, Teasdale, in
that event. Coach Thornton will use
the following line-up in the frosh
events:
200-yd. relay—Ransohoff, Elliott,
Tench, Loupe
200-yd. breast—Jacoby, Smith
150-yd. back—Letteau, Wilson
