# FROSH TRACKMEN CHANGE MEET DAY DUE TO WEATHER
## 
### 
Yesterday's rains brought post
ponement of the Stanford frosh-San
1 Mateo J.C. track meet scheduled for
I Saturday morning. Coach Bill El
lington of the frosh and Tex Byrd of
I the Jaysee team have set Wednes
day afternoon as a tentative date for
j the meet, weather permitting.
Old Man Rain was a friend of the
Stanford frosh in this instance. Three
of the first stringers were in no con
dition to participate, the rest of the
squad can readily use a few more
days of preparation.
Kneiibuhl Out With Flu
Jim Knuebuhl, the Cards' lone
hope to take sprint honors, is in bed
with the flu; Leonard Felberbaum.
quarter-miler, is suffering with a
bad case of shin splints and Leo
Medlem is bothered with a cramped
muscle.
Hank Luisetti, whose high jump
services are being depended upon,
was able to clear only 5 feet 5 inches
Wednesday afternoon while San
! Mateo's jumper does a consistent 5
feet 10 inches. Luisetti, with only
four days of practice on the field, is
having trouble with a sprained ankle
and will welcome a few days addi
tional training time.
Hardin Tosses Spear
Chances for Stanford to take the
javelin throw were increased Wed
nesday when Wallace Hardin sud
denly came to the fore with throws
of 165 and 170 feet. Coach Ellington
declares that Hardin -will be break
ing records before the season is over.
Lack of quarter-mile material has
led Ellington to encourage Dick
Lyon, frosh basketballer, to take a
try at this event. Lyon has shown a
good stride and should be making
better times soon.
