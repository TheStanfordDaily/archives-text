# STANFORD GOLFERS TO PLAY TOMORROW IN OPENING ROUND OF CITY TOURNAMENT
## 
### 
Stanford sends a five-man team
into the match play of the San
Francisco City Golf Tournament to
morrow with good chances that one
will survive to play in the finals
several weeks hence.
The outstanding man is Don Ed
wards who tied for medalist's honors
in qualifying round. He shot a 73,
even par. In his opening match he
meets George Lewis, who qualified
considerably higher. For the past
week Edwards has been working on
his game at Stanford, stressing the
long iron shots that are so necessary
on the Harding Park course.
Erskine May Change
Morse Erskine, varsity golfer, also
has an excellent chance if he
straightens out the chronic hook in
his drive. He qualified with a 79

and plays Roy Marsh, who qualified
with a 77.
Bob Thompson is the other mem
ber of the varsity to play in the city.
He has been off his game lately,
dropping a 5-4 verdict to his fellow
varsity ladder man, Bill Hoelle. He
qualified high among the Stanford
men in the tournament with an 80.
He is matched with Fred Corvi in
the opening.

among the qualifiersâ€”Alan Hyman
with a 7G, and Louis Cass, number
one freshman golfer and recent win
ner of the Intercollegiate Freshman
title at Del Monte. Cass had a 78.
