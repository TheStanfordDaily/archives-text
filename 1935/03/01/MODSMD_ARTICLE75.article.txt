GRAND CUSTOM
BEATING STANFORD
Gradually the idea that Stanford
may have a better basketball team
than California is seeping into the
beings of the U.C. .sports followers.
The Daily Californian's sports
columnist goes so far as to fear the
loss ot "that grand old custom of
winning basketball primes from
Stanford Frosh dinks may go.
Wheeler Oaks may pass into tooth
picks .... but bow to u Stanford
basketball team? Never!"
Here's the reason why a win over
the Bears tomorrow night would
warm the hearts of thy group of en
thusiasts that have stuck with John
Bunn and the Cardinal hoopsters.
The victory two weeks ago, merely
the Stanford "quota" for the year,
could easily be callcd a lucky one.
But two in a row would mean that
the Indian is once again, after a
lapse of a dozen years, a match for
the Bear.
Card fans need not "put fourteen
years of agitation into lusty thumb
nosing," as the Daily Cal columnist
fears. The idea of getting rid of ihe
bugaboo of inevitable California vic
tories in basketball would be satis
faction enough.
ONE WAY TO START
TRAINING FOR TRACK
One of the more interesting of the
sport yarns now making the rounds
in the East Bay concerns three of
California's up and coming track
stars- George Anderson, holder, of a
mark ol 9.4 seconds in the century
as a frosh last year; Mushy Pollock,
ace ol 1934 junior college sprinters;
and Jim Helmer, sophomore quarter
miler now running close to 50 sec
onds fiat.
Some ten days ago Coach Brutus
Hamilton suggested that the "varsity
should start intensive training, right
sleep, easy on the sweets, etc. An
derson, Pollock, and Helmer are
conscientious track men, but hated
the idea of giving up the frequent
trips to the local confectioners.
A compromise resulted. They
decided to have their quota of
sweets for the coming months of
the track season in one evening,
and to start training the next day.
As the favorite fountain the trio
consumed three milkshakes for a
starter, cased off with just plain
ice cream, and finished up with a
"refreshing pause," cokes. Track
practice was resumed three days
later.

GRAND CUSTOM
BEATING STANFORD
Gradually the idea that Stanford
may have a better basketball team
than California is seeping into the
beings of the U.C. .sports followers.
The Daily Californian's sports
columnist goes so far as to fear the
loss ot "that grand old custom of
winning basketball primes from
Stanford Frosh dinks may go.
Wheeler Oaks may pass into tooth
picks .... but bow to u Stanford
basketball team? Never!"
Here's the reason why a win over
the Bears tomorrow night would
warm the hearts of thy group of en
thusiasts that have stuck with John
Bunn and the Cardinal hoopsters.
The victory two weeks ago, merely
the Stanford "quota" for the year,
could easily be callcd a lucky one.
But two in a row would mean that
the Indian is once again, after a
lapse of a dozen years, a match for
the Bear.
Card fans need not "put fourteen
years of agitation into lusty thumb
nosing," as the Daily Cal columnist
fears. The idea of getting rid of ihe
bugaboo of inevitable California vic
tories in basketball would be satis
faction enough.
ONE WAY TO START
TRAINING FOR TRACK
One of the more interesting of the
sport yarns now making the rounds
in the East Bay concerns three of
California's up and coming track
stars- George Anderson, holder, of a
mark ol 9.4 seconds in the century
as a frosh last year; Mushy Pollock,
ace ol 1934 junior college sprinters;
and Jim Helmer, sophomore quarter
miler now running close to 50 sec
onds fiat.
Some ten days ago Coach Brutus
Hamilton suggested that the "varsity
should start intensive training, right
sleep, easy on the sweets, etc. An
derson, Pollock, and Helmer are
conscientious track men, but hated
the idea of giving up the frequent
trips to the local confectioners.
A compromise resulted. They
decided to have their quota of
sweets for the coming months of
the track season in one evening,
and to start training the next day.
As the favorite fountain the trio
consumed three milkshakes for a
starter, cased off with just plain
ice cream, and finished up with a
"refreshing pause," cokes. Track
practice was resumed three days
later.
