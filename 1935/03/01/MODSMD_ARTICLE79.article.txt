### Craig Barhash 
A giant Breakers five, challenged
mid-way in the second half, turned
on the power with seven minutes iO
go at the Pavilion last night and
pulled away from a smaller, lighting
El Campo to win the University bas
ketball championship, 36 to 20.
As John Bunn tossed the ball up
for the opening jump the action
.started. Roger Munger, Breaker cen
ter, tipped to Ray Williamson who
heaved to a gold-shirted teammate,
Harlan Carter, for a.yet-up.
Ted Lerch countered with a free
throw for Campo, but rapid lire
shooting by Martin Raskin, Mun
ger, and George Vigue brought
Breakers' total to eight immedia
tely.
Harold Fulkerson stemmed the
tide against the blue-shirts momen
tarily, bring Campo's total to three.
But playing at a very fast clip.
Breakers ran their score to 20 at half
time.
Lerch kept Campo in the ball '.ame
with beautiful shooting and floor
work entering the second half. But
with the score at 16-24. Adrian Thiel
was inserted for Breakers and es
caped for two quick set-ups.
This was a signal for Breakers'
final rush, directed largely by flic
cool control of the ball at guard
position by George Vigue. His
passing to Munger and Carter
added two more buckets, which
even the continued accuracy of
Lerch could not counteract.
Munger's one-hand shot, made
under full speed at this point, was
one of the best shots of the evening.
But Campo was not done yet and
Sam Lee and Lerch countering rap
idly with baskets, though trailing
hopelessly.
Munger was high for Breakers
with nine, while Lerch dominated
Campo's scoring with 16 points.
