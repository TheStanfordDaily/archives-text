# Center [illegible] Elimination In Bunn Report to Coaches
## 
### 
When the National Association of i
Basketball Coaches meets in Chicago, !
April 3, 4, and 5, it will hear the !
acclaim of the Pacific Coast and the !
entire country for the calibre of bas- I
ketbal! produced by eliminating the !
center jump, according to a report j
on this season's innovation of play ;
in the Pacific Coast Conference ,
southern division, being prepared by
John Bunn.
The Stanford coach expressed a j
belief yesterday that the unani- j
mous endorsement voiced by his re- !
port for out-of-bounds instead of j
center-jump play after a score !
would move the Coaches Associa
tion and ultimately the National i
Rules Committee to accept this j
change in basketball rules for the j
entire country.
Held up two years ago by Bunn's j
skepticism, the new ruling — by j
which the ball goes into play from
the end line immediately after a !
basket is scored—won a trial this 1
season when coaches "Nibs" Price,
"Caddy" Works, and Sam Barry of
the southern division obtained the
Stanford coach's reluctant consent.
Now Bunn is as enthusiastic as
any. and he is joined by a recent
campus visitor, L. S. W. St. John,

director of athletics at Ohio State
and chairman of the National Bas
keibal! Rules Committee. Bunn has
St. John's word that he hopes the
out of bounds play is adopted na
tionally to displace the center jump.
"The spread of .basketball to 59
countries and its inclusion in the
program of the 1936 Olympic Games,"
Bunn explains, "calls for a removal
of undue injury hazards, the speed
ing up of the game, and the elim
ination of handicaps for slight stature
now placed on smaller, foreign com
petitors.
"My findings that with the stop
watch," he continues, "show actual
play is six to eight minutes longer
in a regular collegiate game and
about 4 minutes longer in high
school contests; jostling and jockey
ing decreases; and aggressiveness is
given the chance to overcome lack
of height among small men—all of
which convinces me basketball will
profit by displacing the center jump
with the pass-in from out of bounds."
Letters from the Mid-West, where
Stanford exhibited the new play on
a barnstorming tour this winter, con
cur with Bunn, as do similar testi
monies from the Rocky Mountain
district and from all the Pacific
slope.
