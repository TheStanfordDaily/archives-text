# JUROR RELATED TO FITZGERALD, REA DECLARES
## Lamson Defense Asks That Jurors Be Reopened For Questioning 
### 
SAN JOSE, Feb. 28 (A') — The
question of a juror's relationship to
a prosecutor put an unprecedented
legal snarl today in attempts to se
lect a jury for the second David A.
Lamson wife murder trial, and a
puzzled court went searching for
helpful references.
The tangled situation arose from a
defense motion to reopen the jurors
to challenges and questioning after
both sides had accepted a jury of
eight men and four women.
The motion, made by Attorney
Edwin McKenzie, was based on in
formation he said he received that
Juror P. T. Peabody was related to
Deputy District Attorney John Fitz
gerald. Questioning developed the
two were cousins by marriage.
Superior Judge R. R. Syer, ob
viously displeased that eight days
had been consumed in attempts to
impanel a jury, put decision on the
motion over until tomorrow, when he
also will rule on two other questions
involved.
The other problems on which
Judge Syer will seek authorities to
night involve how many challenges
each side may have should the jury
be reopened to questioning, and
whether any juror or alternate be
sides Peabody may be challenged.
The 12 jurors and two alternates,
who tonight virtually were and were
not a jury, were placed in custody of
bailiff pending decision on their
status. It has been indicated, how
ever, that when a jury is obtained,
it will be under watch of bailiffs
when not in court.
McKenzie's motion to reopen the
jury produced a bitter clash be
tween counsel, and dickering kept
up for several minutes with occa
sional comment by the court.
McKenzie cited a case to prove
his contention Peabody was guilty
of misconduct.
"I move challenges be opened up
or that a mistrial be ordered," Mc-
Kenzie demanded.
"I am in favor of reopening the
jury to challenge," interposed Judge
Syer, "we had best put this matter
over until tomorrow."
Attorneys said the situation was
one that never before had come up
in legal annals of Santa Cla,ra county.
