the program of the conference.
The former President and Mrs.
Hoover invited the members of the
conference to their home for an in
formal hour before the closing ban
quet last night. Mr. Hoover also
spoke briefly at the banquet.
"In the future Stanford will be

upon her alumni who will have to
assume the burden of seeing to it
that the youth of the future will
have the same educational oppor

Hoover in his talk at the banquet.
The discussions on current world
problems led by prominent profes

He also stated that he believed that
if and when the United States with

relieved of the responsibility of pro
tecting the islands and become again
an American nation, Professor Treat
called for our withdrawal from the
Philippines.
"We have no interests in Asia
worth the shedding of American
