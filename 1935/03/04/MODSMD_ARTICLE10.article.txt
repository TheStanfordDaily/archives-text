, the dance program which will be j
presented Wednesday in the Dance j
! Studio of the Roble Gym.
Henry Cowell's class in percus- :
i sion, a regular course in the curricu- j

ment, using the strange native in- |
struments of different countries.
Some ctf these instruments have been
made by students in the class and

jell during his travels.
Many of these instruments are
used by modern dance orchestras
| when playing rhumba or tango
I rhythms. These include the Balanese
j tin click, the Cuban bongo, and split
bamboos from Hawaii. Cymbals,
Japanese gongs, Chinese tom-toms,
j Cuban maracas, Assyrian clay
, drums, and sets of musical glasses
complete the array.
Because of the limited seating ca
pacity of the Dance Studio, tickets
i will be distributed at the A.S.S.U.
! office on Monday, Tuesday, and
Wednesday. Between noon and 1
< o'clock on Monday tickets may be
had at the postofTice corner.
