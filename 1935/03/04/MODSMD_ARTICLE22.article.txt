# An Unwholesome Fear Of Educational Octopi
## 
### 
Fear ol' "cosily duplication of educational
facilities" and reluctance to see any of Ihe
University of (California's money trickle out
of Rerkeley are reasons gi\en by Hay Region
educators for their opposition to an educa
tional expansion hill now before the (California
legislature.
This hill would make four-year institutions
out of a few junior colleges, as well as ex
panding the seven stale teachers' colleges to
include a liberal arts course for graduation.
The issue has long bothered Berkeley lead
ers. They are troubled with nightmares, in
which they see potential university students
going to college at home, getting a liberal arts
education there instead of having to travel
some hundreds of miles to a university (if
they can a fiord it).
The University of (California should not
have its very valuable educational activities
curtailed, of course. Rut why appropriate for
expansion there instead of permitting a much
needed reform which would benefit thousands
of high school graduates? After all, there
are many young people -who cannot possibly
aliord to go away to school, and who are
not interested in having education courses
crammed down their throats, as is the case
now it they wish a state college diploma.
There is roo'm in (California for many col
leges; there are-many people who prefer and
can aflord attending the larger universities.
Rut there must be some place for the less pros
perous student, who can aflord an education
only if his college is near home.
(Combined opposition of university heads
and the alumni associations will probably de
feat the bill, as a similar measure was snowed
under two years ago; but the attitude shown
by the heads of these large universities seems
to the rest of the people of the state .just a bit
selfish.
