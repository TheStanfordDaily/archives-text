# The 						Wolves at Montana State

### 
Major sports nt the Montana Slate Univer
sity face banishment because the alumni club
of Helena lias become thoroughly disgusted
with the showing ol' the school's teams. The
alumni have petitioned the university au
thorities to take measures to do away with the
various teams which "seem to lend an air ol
mediocrity to the entire institution."
Such a move appears to he facetious. For a
group of right-minded graduates to propose
such a measure seems unreasonable. On the
surface, it is the old question of the alumni
trying to run the affairs of Ihe undergraduates
lor the satisfaction of the enjoyment-seeking
"old-t i mers."
The alumni accepted the principle that the
sports were run for their pleasureâ€”to have
poor teams was to disgrace the university.
Fvidently the thought that perhaps the under
graduates got some pleasure out of playing on
Ihe squads never entered the petitioners'
heads, or that athletics were established and
conducted for the enjoyment and development
of the students.
A like action might have been taken by the
Stanford alumni associations in any of the
big cities in any of the Indians' lean years of
sports. The crop of championships enjoyed
by the campus for the last couple of years
would chide any alumni of the Farm who
could have contemplated such action.
The records of varsity sports, sports in
general for that matter, run in cycles as does
business. A little patient waiting, strong back
ing, and a more understanding attitude on the
part of the Montana State alumni might alle
viate the sore situation and produce an era of
belter athletics in I lie Mountain slale.
