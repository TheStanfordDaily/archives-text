### CROMPTON BANGS, Jr 
TWO YEARS OF HITLER
BOSTON, Mass., Feb. 27—Whatever wc may think
and say about Hitler, we will have to admit that' he has
done more "impossible" things than any man living.
Only a little more than two years ago he became Ger
many s chancellor. As some people had expected, he
promptly gobbled up German democracy and deified
himsell as the Realmleader. The Reich was Ayranized
and the leader became The State. All that was ex
pected, too. What was unexpected was the tremen
dous change in Europe's diplomacy. Here Hitler
caused several things that were thought impossible.
During the first year of Nazi rule he managed to
expose the poor teamwork of his enemies. This was
.shown by the noticeable decline of French prestige
her allies and by the rise of Italy as the de
fender of Austria. Hitler's friendly overtures to hostile
and suspicious Poland finally managed to materialize
that country's political relations with France. So the
Poles were no longer actively hostile to Germany; ihey
were just plain suspicious—which is a big difference
in Europe.
While Germany's enemies were unable to get to
gether on any common front, the Nazis proceeded to
rearm Germany at an alarming rate. That also should
have been expected. After all, certain influential
French and German arm manufacturers are reported to
have invested heavily in Hitler and cannot be blamed
for cashing in at the earliest possible chance. Today
it is reliably reported that Germany equals France
in trained manpower and fighting planes and will rival
her in artillery and tanks within three years.
Thus the poor teamwork of Germany's enemies
and German re-armament made 1933-34 a Hitler
year. The result was finally to bring all of Ger
many's enemies together—an impossibility only a
year ago. A decade of diplomacy Puled to do what
the Hitler scare did in a few months.
First France and Italy apparently reached an under
standing after years of bickering and mutual distrust.
Of course, the consideration for Italy's dissatisfaction
of the Versailles Treaty was a free hand in Abyssinia,
while France got the League to look the other way,
but it was-worth it.
Then France and Russia, sensing a mutual enemy in
Nazi Germany, returned to their pre-war friendship.
Somehow many Frenchmen are suspicious of this one,
having lost countless millions of francs in the last one.
But security is, after all, more important than anything
else to the French.
Across the channel in England, Stanley Baldwin
was heard to say the British frontier was at the Rhine,
thus putting his country in the same boat with France
and Russia.
The final step in the complete hemining-in of
Germany came last week when it became per
fectly apparent that France, England, Italy, and
Russia had joined in a plan to prevent any further
enlargement of German territory and force her
return to the League. The Reich was apparently to
be permitted to rearm — legally — with certain
limitations.
When this idea was first presented to the Realm
leader he hedged by trying to drive a wedge between
France and England in offering to talk with England
right away about air defense. When this line of attack
got nowhere Hitler finally agreed to discuss everything
asked for.
It is hard to tell just where this puts things. Ger
many is faced by a desperate economic situation, aggra
vated by the foreign anti-Nazi boycott and the bad
crops of last year. Unemployment is actually worse
than a year ago. What is more, the Nazis seem to be
splitting into two camps, with Hitler at the of one
and the violent fire-eaters headed by discontented storm
troopers on the outside looking in.
If Hitler accepts the proposals made to him,
Germany's frontiers will be frozen in their present
state, which won't please the fire-eaters at all. But
in view of the economic situation, Hitler could get
a great deal of support in Germany by showing that
all Germany wanted was peace, security and equal
ity in armaments, and that his foreign policy had*
gotten what all Germans wanted and what none
lr\d been able to get until he came along. Thus
Hitler would seemingly have achieved the impos
sible in persuading France to agree to a partial
abandonment of the Versailles Treaty.
Of course, nobody knows exactly how everything
will come out in the end, but it is safe to say that if
Hitler can keep his own country in check he is likely
to agree substantially to what France, England, et al.
have proposed. We have to remember that the four most
powerful nations in Europe are working on Germany
and that under these conditions The Reich has very
little elbow room. Hitler is apparently faced with the
alternatives of co-operation or hemmed-in isolation. It
would be foolish to choose isolation as all Europe now
seems to be intent on curbing unchecked Nazi plans
for expansion.

Hitler can keep his own country in check he is likely
to agree substantially to what France, England, et al.
have proposed. We have to remember that the four most
powerful nations in Europe are working on Germany
and that under these conditions The Reich has very
little elbow room. Hitler is apparently faced with the
alternatives of co-operation or hemmed-in isolation. It
would be foolish to choose isolation as all Europe now
seems to be intent on curbing unchecked Nazi plans
for expansion.
TWO YEARS OF HITLER
BOSTON, Mass., Feb. 27—Whatever wc may think
and say about Hitler, we will have to admit that' he has
done more "impossible" things than any man living.
Only a little more than two years ago he became Ger
many s chancellor. As some people had expected, he
promptly gobbled up German democracy and deified
himsell as the Realmleader. The Reich was Ayranized
and the leader became The State. All that was ex
pected, too. What was unexpected was the tremen
dous change in Europe's diplomacy. Here Hitler
caused several things that were thought impossible.
During the first year of Nazi rule he managed to
expose the poor teamwork of his enemies. This was
.shown by the noticeable decline of French prestige
her allies and by the rise of Italy as the de
fender of Austria. Hitler's friendly overtures to hostile
and suspicious Poland finally managed to materialize
that country's political relations with France. So the
Poles were no longer actively hostile to Germany; ihey
were just plain suspicious—which is a big difference
in Europe.
While Germany's enemies were unable to get to
gether on any common front, the Nazis proceeded to
rearm Germany at an alarming rate. That also should
have been expected. After all, certain influential
French and German arm manufacturers are reported to
have invested heavily in Hitler and cannot be blamed
for cashing in at the earliest possible chance. Today
it is reliably reported that Germany equals France
in trained manpower and fighting planes and will rival
her in artillery and tanks within three years.
Thus the poor teamwork of Germany's enemies
and German re-armament made 1933-34 a Hitler
year. The result was finally to bring all of Ger
many's enemies together—an impossibility only a
year ago. A decade of diplomacy Puled to do what
the Hitler scare did in a few months.
First France and Italy apparently reached an under
standing after years of bickering and mutual distrust.
Of course, the consideration for Italy's dissatisfaction
of the Versailles Treaty was a free hand in Abyssinia,
while France got the League to look the other way,
but it was-worth it.
Then France and Russia, sensing a mutual enemy in
Nazi Germany, returned to their pre-war friendship.
Somehow many Frenchmen are suspicious of this one,
having lost countless millions of francs in the last one.
But security is, after all, more important than anything
else to the French.
Across the channel in England, Stanley Baldwin
was heard to say the British frontier was at the Rhine,
thus putting his country in the same boat with France
and Russia.
The final step in the complete hemining-in of
Germany came last week when it became per
fectly apparent that France, England, Italy, and
Russia had joined in a plan to prevent any further
enlargement of German territory and force her
return to the League. The Reich was apparently to
be permitted to rearm — legally — with certain
limitations.
When this idea was first presented to the Realm
leader he hedged by trying to drive a wedge between
France and England in offering to talk with England
right away about air defense. When this line of attack
got nowhere Hitler finally agreed to discuss everything
asked for.
It is hard to tell just where this puts things. Ger
many is faced by a desperate economic situation, aggra
vated by the foreign anti-Nazi boycott and the bad
crops of last year. Unemployment is actually worse
than a year ago. What is more, the Nazis seem to be
splitting into two camps, with Hitler at the of one
and the violent fire-eaters headed by discontented storm
troopers on the outside looking in.
If Hitler accepts the proposals made to him,
Germany's frontiers will be frozen in their present
state, which won't please the fire-eaters at all. But
in view of the economic situation, Hitler could get
a great deal of support in Germany by showing that
all Germany wanted was peace, security and equal
ity in armaments, and that his foreign policy had*
gotten what all Germans wanted and what none
lr\d been able to get until he came along. Thus
Hitler would seemingly have achieved the impos
sible in persuading France to agree to a partial
abandonment of the Versailles Treaty.
Of course, nobody knows exactly how everything
will come out in the end, but it is safe to say that if
Hitler can keep his own country in check he is likely

a great deal of support in Germany by showing that
all Germany wanted was peace, security and equal
ity in armaments, and that his foreign policy had*
gotten what all Germans wanted and what none
lr\d been able to get until he came along. Thus
Hitler would seemingly have achieved the impos
sible in persuading France to agree to a partial
abandonment of the Versailles Treaty.
Of course, nobody knows exactly how everything
will come out in the end, but it is safe to say that if
Hitler can keep his own country in check he is likely
to agree substantially to what France, England, et al.
have proposed. We have to remember that the four most
powerful nations in Europe are working on Germany
and that under these conditions The Reich has very
little elbow room. Hitler is apparently faced with the
alternatives of co-operation or hemmed-in isolation. It
would be foolish to choose isolation as all Europe now
seems to be intent on curbing unchecked Nazi plans
for expansion.
TWO YEARS OF HITLER
BOSTON, Mass., Feb. 27—Whatever wc may think
and say about Hitler, we will have to admit that' he has
done more "impossible" things than any man living.
Only a little more than two years ago he became Ger
many s chancellor. As some people had expected, he
promptly gobbled up German democracy and deified
himsell as the Realmleader. The Reich was Ayranized
and the leader became The State. All that was ex
pected, too. What was unexpected was the tremen
dous change in Europe's diplomacy. Here Hitler
caused several things that were thought impossible.
During the first year of Nazi rule he managed to
expose the poor teamwork of his enemies. This was
.shown by the noticeable decline of French prestige
her allies and by the rise of Italy as the de
fender of Austria. Hitler's friendly overtures to hostile
and suspicious Poland finally managed to materialize
that country's political relations with France. So the
Poles were no longer actively hostile to Germany; ihey
were just plain suspicious—which is a big difference
in Europe.
While Germany's enemies were unable to get to
gether on any common front, the Nazis proceeded to
rearm Germany at an alarming rate. That also should
have been expected. After all, certain influential
French and German arm manufacturers are reported to
have invested heavily in Hitler and cannot be blamed
for cashing in at the earliest possible chance. Today
it is reliably reported that Germany equals France
in trained manpower and fighting planes and will rival
her in artillery and tanks within three years.
Thus the poor teamwork of Germany's enemies
and German re-armament made 1933-34 a Hitler
year. The result was finally to bring all of Ger
many's enemies together—an impossibility only a
year ago. A decade of diplomacy Puled to do what
the Hitler scare did in a few months.
First France and Italy apparently reached an under
standing after years of bickering and mutual distrust.
Of course, the consideration for Italy's dissatisfaction
of the Versailles Treaty was a free hand in Abyssinia,
while France got the League to look the other way,
but it was-worth it.
Then France and Russia, sensing a mutual enemy in
Nazi Germany, returned to their pre-war friendship.
Somehow many Frenchmen are suspicious of this one,
having lost countless millions of francs in the last one.
But security is, after all, more important than anything
else to the French.
Across the channel in England, Stanley Baldwin
was heard to say the British frontier was at the Rhine,
thus putting his country in the same boat with France
and Russia.
The final step in the complete hemining-in of
Germany came last week when it became per
fectly apparent that France, England, Italy, and
Russia had joined in a plan to prevent any further
enlargement of German territory and force her
return to the League. The Reich was apparently to
be permitted to rearm — legally — with certain
limitations.
When this idea was first presented to the Realm
leader he hedged by trying to drive a wedge between
France and England in offering to talk with England
right away about air defense. When this line of attack
got nowhere Hitler finally agreed to discuss everything
asked for.
It is hard to tell just where this puts things. Ger
many is faced by a desperate economic situation, aggra
vated by the foreign anti-Nazi boycott and the bad
crops of last year. Unemployment is actually worse
than a year ago. What is more, the Nazis seem to be
splitting into two camps, with Hitler at the of one
and the violent fire-eaters headed by discontented storm
troopers on the outside looking in.
If Hitler accepts the proposals made to him,
Germany's frontiers will be frozen in their present
state, which won't please the fire-eaters at all. But
in view of the economic situation, Hitler could get
a great deal of support in Germany by showing that
all Germany wanted was peace, security and equal
ity in armaments, and that his foreign policy had*
gotten what all Germans wanted and what none
lr\d been able to get until he came along. Thus
Hitler would seemingly have achieved the impos
sible in persuading France to agree to a partial
abandonment of the Versailles Treaty.
Of course, nobody knows exactly how everything
will come out in the end, but it is safe to say that if
Hitler can keep his own country in check he is likely
to agree substantially to what France, England, et al.
have proposed. We have to remember that the four most
powerful nations in Europe are working on Germany
and that under these conditions The Reich has very
little elbow room. Hitler is apparently faced with the
alternatives of co-operation or hemmed-in isolation. It
would be foolish to choose isolation as all Europe now
seems to be intent on curbing unchecked Nazi plans
for expansion.
