Advancing into the ranks of big-time columnists,
Our Hasher, pirouetting pi*ttily, announces his first
contributor, the mysterious "J. McC."
He contributes:
"When winter comes I dig myself in,
With a pipe and a book and a bottle of gin,
And in summer I find me a nice, shady nook
And settle me down with pipe, gin, and book.
Then when autumn is here and the pumpkins are ripe,
I often stay home with a book, gin and pipe.
But when the snow melts and I find it is spring,
And the flowers come out and the little birds sing,
Tis then to enjoy life that I really begin,
With a pipe, and a book, and a bottle of gin.
J. McC.
We would caution J. McC. that a pipe and book
might eventually lead him to conduct unbecoming a j
Stanford gentleman. The gin's all right, because there
hasn't been any gin on the campus since 1891. But the '
combination of books and pipes leads to A's, and Stan
ford gentlemen don't seek A's.
As the head in the fashion edition mentioned:
"Fashionable Men Seek
Smart and Durable Bags."
This head caused the edit staff of The Daily to gnash
its teeth, and the staff of the Reserved Book Room to
laugh gaily and throw call slips all over the libe.

I don't know why all this should remind me of the
Chi Psi's, but it seems that after indulging in a pro
found discussion with the Chinese cook on the merits
of rice as a nutritive element uf Ihe diet, and-thr cause ;
for the early and profuse flowering of oriental civili- j
zation, I learned this little gem: "Chi Psi bum boy. No
likee ricc."
He further elaborated the statement with: "Phi
Dak boy bum boy. Allee time sing, tiilkee. tellum
storee, takum appool. Phi Dak boy too muchee girl allee i
iime. Phi Dak boy scared of Jap cook Jap cook no good
—no puttum sugar in pie."
