"CLIVE OF INDIA"
At Stanford Theatre
Follow the fascinating adventures
,of engaging Robert Clive, who rises
from East India Company employe
to famous adventurer, rebel hunt
!er, and parliamentarian. Follow his
I tempestuous romance with the wom
an whose portrait fascinates him
j (Loretta Young), and then follow
| that marriage of his which must be
sacrificed for the protection of India.
You'll feel yourself a part of "Clive
of India," and when the action is
| ended, you'll understand just what
j it, is that makes England's the great
| est empire on earth.
Ronald Colman catches the in
! trepid spirit of Clive, and he later
(gives an admirable picture of ihe
j fallen man, who is repudiated both
j by his country and his wife. Loretta
| Young is handsome in the gowns of
! the eighteenth century, and she does
j some mighty fine trouping. All the
l players are competent, the produc
tion is lavish and in good taste, and
| the photography is little short of
phenomenal. "Clive of India" is one
of the film events of the decade.
