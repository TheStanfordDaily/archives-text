, (Editor's Note: Presenting various
new vocational fields through The
Daily, Dr. C. Gilbert Wrenn of the
! Vocational Guidance Committee dis
; cusses the "Soil Erosion Service.")
A little more than a year ago the
I Soil Erosion Service was created as
J a part of the federal government's
I conservation program. Since then its
j directors have searched the country
for men who might qualify as soil
erosion experts. They are still hav
ing some difficulty finding well
qualified people for the various
! branches ol its work.
! To the practice of this newest ag-
I ricultural science must be brought
1 the combined knowledge of the ag
' ronomist (who specialized in crop
production), the soil technologist, the
i engineer, the forester, the range spe-
I eialist, and the economist.
Study Necessary
, The service must constantly be
I sold to the land owners, and the
farmers convinced that the advice
given is to their advantage. This re
-1 quires, in addition to a technical
| stafl, men to carry on the extension
| work. In the field of research there
lis much to be done in connection
i with soil erosion work in ecology
j (adaptation of plants to environ
, ment) and genetics (development of
i plants).
In the opinion of Mr. Harry E.
j Reddick, Santa Paula, regional di
rector lor the California soil erosion
project., the men chiefly needed for
j the service are soil technologists,
agonomists, and agricultural engi
| neers.
Training Needed
J "Thorough training for any one of
I these professions," he pointed out,
"takes from four to six years to com
plete. The person considering soil
erosioji work as a career should spe
cialize in one of these branches, tak
i ing enough courses in the others to
understand their relation to his own.
! This is the best he can do at pres
j ent, since no university yet offers
training which would fit him spe
; cifically to become a soil erosion
j expert."
Four universities which apparent
| ly give unusually thorough training
lin these fields are: University of
j California, Cornell University, lowa
I State College, and University of
| Wisconsin.
Service Permanent
| The present program of the soil
I erosion service is under the U. S.
Department of the Interior, with a
i $20,000,000 appropriation. This allot
ment lasts until June 30, 1935. with
every indication that this work will
be made a permanent part of the
federal government's conservation
program.
At present there are 29 soil erosion
projects and two sub-projects being
carried on in 28 states. Eiich regional
director has under him a staff of
about 20 people. The Soil Erosion
Service is not under civil service at
present. Applications for employ
ment must be filed in the regional
offices. Salaries range from $1440 to
$4000 a year.

A little more than a year ago the
I Soil Erosion Service was created as
J a part of the federal government's
I conservation program. Since then its
j directors have searched the country
for men who might qualify as soil
erosion experts. They are still hav
ing some difficulty finding well
qualified people for the various
! branches ol its work.
! To the practice of this newest ag-
I ricultural science must be brought
1 the combined knowledge of the ag
' ronomist (who specialized in crop
production), the soil technologist, the
i engineer, the forester, the range spe-
I eialist, and the economist.
Study Necessary
, The service must constantly be
I sold to the land owners, and the
farmers convinced that the advice
given is to their advantage. This re
-1 quires, in addition to a technical
| stafl, men to carry on the extension
| work. In the field of research there
lis much to be done in connection
i with soil erosion work in ecology
j (adaptation of plants to environ
, ment) and genetics (development of
i plants).
In the opinion of Mr. Harry E.
j Reddick, Santa Paula, regional di
rector lor the California soil erosion
project., the men chiefly needed for
j the service are soil technologists,
agonomists, and agricultural engi

Training Needed
J "Thorough training for any one of
I these professions," he pointed out,
"takes from four to six years to com
plete. The person considering soil
erosioji work as a career should spe
cialize in one of these branches, tak
i ing enough courses in the others to
