# BEARS DOWN CARD HOOPSTERS, 50-43, AS SERIES CLOSES
## California Gains Second Place in Conference Standings by Win 
### Mort D'Evelyn 
With a 50 to 43 victory over Stan
ford Saturday night, University of
California cagers won out in a three
way battle for second position in the
Coast conference and retained their
"grand old custom of heating Stan
ford in basketball" with their third
win in the annual four-game series.
Meanwhile in the south the Bruins
were losing their last game to the
Trojans, leaving the second place po
sition open to the winner of the
Card-Bear game and making official
for the Trojans their previously
cinched conference title.
Bears Lead
In Berkeley the game was obvious
ly California's from the outset. The
Bears were not only playing the
steam-roller game at its most effect
iveness but were hitting the bucket
with regularity. The Cards, however,
did not fold up after the first shock,
the Bears taking an early five-point
lead, but fought back, matching Cali
fornia field goal for field goal but
never quite able to make up for the
early handicap.
Once the Indians did tie up the
game at 17 all, but Cal started mov
ing away again, and stretched out
their lead to ten points early in the
second half. The closing minutes
found Stanford scoring repeatedly
on long range shots from the floor,
but with California protecting its
generous lead with one-handed
swishers by Ray Olsen.
Stanford was led as usual by its
conscientious sophomore captain,
Dinty Moore, whose daring rushes
through the California defense kept
Stanford up in the scoring column
and gave Moore high point honors
for the Cards with 14.
Seniors Last (iame
Otherwise it was a great evening
for the seniors, Keith Topping, Rod
Bost, Anne Anderson, and Emil
Cowing closing their hoop careers for
Stanford and Captain Dave Meek
and Jack Kopke for California.
Topping played easily his best
game of the year, using his height
and weight so effectively that Stan
ford received the majority of the
rebounds.
Emil Cowing was sent into the
game in the closing minutes with
the hope that he might be able to
break up the game with his long
range field goals as he did one Cali
fornia-Stanford tilt last year. Three
long swishers in almost as many
times gave Cowing's basketball ca
reer a brilliant finish, but the Bears
wouldn't be overtaken.
Bears Star
Meek was California's most con
sistent scorer, and was high point
man of the evening with 15. Captain
Dave kept his California five hust
ling, and it was his scores that spelled
defeat for the Cards. His effective
ness Saturday night was most ap
parent when in the open minutes he
leaped high to pass, found no man
open, so at the last minute shoved
the ball at the hoop, and it swished.
Kopke was the ball hawk for the
Bears, and was having the usual
success with his one-handed shots
from the center court, scoring 13
points.

Seniors Last (iame
Otherwise it was a great evening
for the seniors, Keith Topping, Rod
Bost, Anne Anderson, and Emil
Cowing closing their hoop careers for
Stanford and Captain Dave Meek
and Jack Kopke for California.
Topping played easily his best
game of the year, using his height
and weight so effectively that Stan
ford received the majority of the
rebounds.
Emil Cowing was sent into the
game in the closing minutes with
the hope that he might be able to
break up the game with his long

fornia-Stanford tilt last year. Three
long swishers in almost as many
times gave Cowing's basketball ca
