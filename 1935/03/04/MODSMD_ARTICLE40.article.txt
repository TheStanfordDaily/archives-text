# QUARTET OF HURDLE GREATS
## 
### 
Captain Dick Coe, Tom Moore, Del
Fishback, and John Wood will make
coast fans forget the great team of
Trojan hurdlers of Welsh, Payne and
Paul of the early '30's. The Stanford
custom of winning Big Meet hurdle
races will be seriously threatened
when this quartet take the sticks
for the Blue and Gold next April 20.
