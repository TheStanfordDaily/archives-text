# HEAVY VASTLY IMPROVED RUNNER
## 
### 
Greatest surprise of the whole
meet was the running of sophomore
Bob Heavy (hevee, please). Early
last spring Heavy won himself a
lot of wise-cracks from the smart
alecks by turning out for track.
Weighing close to 190 pounds, clumsy
and with little experience, he looked
like the last man to make a runner.
Heavy lumbered through the half
mile last year and improved enough
to run close to 2 minutes Hat. Satur
day he made his first appearance of
the new year, and Brutus Hamilton
never had a smoothly striding miler
il it isn't Bob Heavy.
For his first mile in a meet, the
Bear sophomore stayed right he
hind Les Voorheis, a great miler
himself and winner of the four
lap race in the Little Big Meet last
year. Coming off the last turn,
Heavy swung wide to pass Voor
heis with such ease and had such
a kick left for the sprint to the
tape that California enthusiasts
are now united in predicting a
promising future for the once lum
bering half-miler.
Sport writers are taking advan
tage of Heavy's adequate underpin
nings for human interest stories. He's
the only runner on the coast to wear
size 13 shoes, takes five months to
get them made, etc. Bill Monahan,
California graduate manager, tells
a better one.
Monahan walked into a barber
shop near the Berkeley Campus on
the afternoon of the Little Big
Meet last spring, and Heavy was
getting a haircut. "Well, Heavy,"
remarked the graduate nvuiager.

! slightly worried. "What are you
j doing here? That meet starts in
J ahout half an hour, doesn't it?
"Yeah," came hack Heavy, as the
barber clipped his locks down to
| hair-brush length. "But I want to
get off all the weight I can.
Heavy was right. He trailed Bob
| Alexander and Bill McCurdy of the
1 Stanford frosh for a lap and a half
j and then won by a whisker at the
1 tape. —D'Evelyn.
