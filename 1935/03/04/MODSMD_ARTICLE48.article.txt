among fraternities and is based on

from year to year rather than rank
ing for one specific year.
The fraternity showing greatest
improvement during the previous
year will be awarded the scholarship,
the amount of which is approxima
tely ยง250; the fraternity receiving the
award will in turn award it to the

and financial need, subject to ap
proval of Interfraternity Council.
In addition to the monetary mem
orial award, a perpetual trophy cup
will be presented each fall by the
Council to the house having the
highest actual ranking without re
gard to improvement.
