# PRODIGY PLAYS IN TOMORROW'S CONCERT HERE
## Ruth Slenczynski To Give Tomorrow's Recital In Pavilion 
### Barbara Sweet 
Ruth Slenczynski, ten-year-old
musica? prodigy, will appear in con
cert at the Pavilion tomorrow eve
ning at 8:20.
At the age of four she gave her |
first public concert at Mills College, i
The child's success was so great there
that she was given a chance to ap
pear at musicales in the large San |
Francisco hotels.
Studied in Europe
In February, 1930, Ruth was heard
in a private audition by Josef Hof
mann, director of the Curtis Insti
tute of Music in Philadelphia. Struck
by the child's talent, Hofmann im
mediately awarded her a full schol
arship to support her in her studies
at the Institute. From the East she
went to Europe, where she gave re
citals in Berlin and Paris and was
accepted as a protege of Misch* El
man, noted violinist.
It was Alfred Cortot of France who
first discovered the greatest advan
tage she possesses—that she plays
like no other pianist has ever played
before. Her "violin" fingers bring a
new expression to the piano, a new
method of playing, and it is this
method of playing that gives her the
exquisite touch she possesses and
lends the strength and endurance to
her childish hands.
Hailed by Critics
Fresh from European triumphs,
she returned to America and gave
her first New York recital at Town
Hall on November 13, 1933, and was
acclaimed by the hard-boiled critics
as an artist of the first rank, hailed
as that strange and inexplicable phe
nomenon—a true child prodigy.
Ruth Slenczynski has created one
of the greatest sensations ever known
in thus country. She has an extraor
dinary memory and she is a most re
markable musician. She has an in
nate artistic taste—something which
could not be taught to a child by any
I method known, and a faculty of
which many mature artists are
| devoid.
The mechanical expertness of her
> playing is likewise remarkable, both
for speed and for volume of tone.
The wonderful independence of the
left hand, which often becomes a
matter of a life-time's training, is
i present to such an uncanny extent
that one must agree with the general
1 dictum that she is a musical genius.
Starting To Compose
'Her creative ability, in point of
! interpretation, is worthy of that of
! a highly gifted mature mind. And
i now she is even commencing to
I compose. What the future holds for
j 1 his child's development as an artist
j and creative musician is beyond pre
diction.

| cert may be obtained at the Concert
iSeries Office in the Old Union or at
