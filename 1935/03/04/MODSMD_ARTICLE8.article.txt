# S.F. Welcomes Arrival Of German Cruiser 'Karlsruhe'
## 
### CEDRIC LARSON 
| While saluting cannon boomed a
j welcome, the first armed naval craft
! of the Third Reich to enter San
| Francisco harbor, the 6000-ton cruis
! er Karlsruhe, with 620 men aboard,
sailed Saturday morning through the
Golden Gate to moor at Pier 37 of
! the peninsular city's waterfront.
Captain Gunther Lutjens, com
mander of the craft and grizzled
veteran of many a world-war sea
engagement, may well enter his
| visit to San Francisco in his log
book in red ink. The ship plans to
remain until Monday, March 11,
•\nd the intervening time will be
one continuous round of diversion
fur officers and men.
Captain Lutjens and his officers
were welcomed by Mayor Angelo
Rossi, Admiral Thomas J. Senn of
the Twelfth United States Naval
District and many other prominent
persons of the Bay area, including
Dr. Gustav Heuser, German consul
general at San Francisco. Captain
Lutjens authorized an interview and
complete tour 'of the cruiser Satur
day morning for the Stanford Dailv,
with Lieutenant Commander W.
Bauer and Senior Lieutenant Kar
ald Grosse.
Extremists of the longshoremen's
union called a half-hour strike
, SatunV'y morning as a protest
against the supression by Hitler
of communism in Germany. About
fifty longshoremen and twice as
j many civilians were on hand at

I Pier 37 to stage the "protest," but
were soon disbursed by police.
Lieutenant Grosse explained that,
I the Karlsruhe, a naval-officers'
i training ship primarily, was stop
ping in San Francisco as part of an
eight-months' cruise covering thous
j ands of miles. They left Kiel last
October 22 and expect to return by
June 20.
The cruiser skirted the eastern and
| western coastline of South America,
i and dropped a wreath in the ocean
where its namesake, the Karlsruhe,
! under Captain Kohler, had been
sunk during the World War. From
San Francisco the ship's itinerary
will include Vancouver, British Col
umbia, doubling back through the
Panama Canal, to Houston, Texas.
From there they will dock at Char
leston, South Carolina, whence they
will sail to Spain where the 120
cadets take their examinations prior
to returning to Germany.
The 6000-ton Karlsruhe is the third
ship of the German navy by that
name, was launched August 20, 1927,
and commissioned November 6,
1929. Its length is 174 meters, breadth
15 meters, and draught 6 meters.
Under the Versailles treaty.
Lieutenant Grosse stated. Germain
was limited to about half ,i dozen
ships of the Karlsruhe type (light-
I rruisers). a few so-railed "vest
pocket" battleships, some destroy
ers, mine sweepers, and mine
layers. but no submarines.
, Armament of the ship includes

| nine 15-cm. guns triple-turreted.
I Each turret is dedicated to the mem
| ory of some great name in German
1 naval history. There are also four
8.8 cm. guns, and twelve above-waler
torpedo-tubes in triple encasement.
The ship's engines boast a speed
|of 32 knots per hour and have a
; capacity of (i 5,000 horse-power. The
' front of the ship has the coat-of
i arms or the cily of Karlsruhe, a
! shield bearing the word "Fidelitas."
The ship does not fly the swastika,
but the black-white-and red war
| flag with the iron cross.
As an expression of good-will, the
American navy lent targets and tugs
I to the Karlsruhe last Wednesday at
San Pedro for target practice.
When asked about the Reichs
fuhrcr, Lieutenant Grosse replied:
"Hitler means more than a mere
political leader to the people of
Germany—he stands for an ideal.
! That ideal to us is a Germany
i whose policy is one of peace, inter
-1 nal and external growth, and a re
spected place in the family of na
tions." He pointed out that before
Hitler's advent there existed 32
political parties in Germany—po
litical chaos—and today there is
hut one—a united front.
From the California street window
lof the San Francisco German con-
Isulate the swastika flew to a brisk
[ocean breeze for a two-fold signifi
cance —Germany's formal acquisition
of the Saarland, and "Willkommen
i Karlsruhe."

sailed Saturday morning through the
Golden Gate to moor at Pier 37 of

engagement, may well enter his

remain until Monday, March 11,
•\nd the intervening time will be

fur officers and men.
Captain Lutjens and his officers
were welcomed by Mayor Angelo
Rossi, Admiral Thomas J. Senn of
the Twelfth United States Naval
District and many other prominent
persons of the Bay area, including
Dr. Gustav Heuser, German consul
general at San Francisco. Captain
Lutjens authorized an interview and
complete tour 'of the cruiser Satur
day morning for the Stanford Dailv,
with Lieutenant Commander W.
Bauer and Senior Lieutenant Kar
ald Grosse.
Extremists of the longshoremen's
union called a half-hour strike
, SatunV'y morning as a protest
against the supression by Hitler
of communism in Germany. About
fifty longshoremen and twice as
j many civilians were on hand at

I Pier 37 to stage the "protest," but
were soon disbursed by police.
Lieutenant Grosse explained that,
I the Karlsruhe, a naval-officers'
i training ship primarily, was stop
ping in San Francisco as part of an
eight-months' cruise covering thous
j ands of miles. They left Kiel last
October 22 and expect to return by
June 20.
The cruiser skirted the eastern and
| western coastline of South America,
i and dropped a wreath in the ocean
where its namesake, the Karlsruhe,
! under Captain Kohler, had been
sunk during the World War. From
San Francisco the ship's itinerary
will include Vancouver, British Col
umbia, doubling back through the
Panama Canal, to Houston, Texas.
From there they will dock at Char
leston, South Carolina, whence they
will sail to Spain where the 120
cadets take their examinations prior
to returning to Germany.
The 6000-ton Karlsruhe is the third
ship of the German navy by that

and commissioned November 6,
1929. Its length is 174 meters, breadth
15 meters, and draught 6 meters.
Under the Versailles treaty.
Lieutenant Grosse stated. Germain
was limited to about half ,i dozen
ships of the Karlsruhe type (light-
I rruisers). a few so-railed "vest
pocket" battleships, some destroy
ers, mine sweepers, and mine
layers. but no submarines.
, Armament of the ship includes

| nine 15-cm. guns triple-turreted.
I Each turret is dedicated to the mem
| ory of some great name in German
1 naval history. There are also four
8.8 cm. guns, and twelve above-waler
torpedo-tubes in triple encasement.
The ship's engines boast a speed
|of 32 knots per hour and have a
; capacity of (i 5,000 horse-power. The
' front of the ship has the coat-of
i arms or the cily of Karlsruhe, a
! shield bearing the word "Fidelitas."

fuhrcr, Lieutenant Grosse replied:
"Hitler means more than a mere
political leader to the people of
Germany—he stands for an ideal.

i whose policy is one of peace, inter
-1 nal and external growth, and a re
spected place in the family of na
tions." He pointed out that before
Hitler's advent there existed 32
political parties in Germany—po
litical chaos—and today there is
hut one—a united front.

| While saluting cannon boomed a
j welcome, the first armed naval craft
! of the Third Reich to enter San
| Francisco harbor, the 6000-ton cruis
! er Karlsruhe, with 620 men aboard,
sailed Saturday morning through the
Golden Gate to moor at Pier 37 of
! the peninsular city's waterfront.
Captain Gunther Lutjens, com
mander of the craft and grizzled
veteran of many a world-war sea
engagement, may well enter his
| visit to San Francisco in his log
book in red ink. The ship plans to
remain until Monday, March 11,
•\nd the intervening time will be
one continuous round of diversion
fur officers and men.
Captain Lutjens and his officers
were welcomed by Mayor Angelo
Rossi, Admiral Thomas J. Senn of
the Twelfth United States Naval
District and many other prominent
persons of the Bay area, including
Dr. Gustav Heuser, German consul
general at San Francisco. Captain
Lutjens authorized an interview and
complete tour 'of the cruiser Satur
day morning for the Stanford Dailv,
with Lieutenant Commander W.
Bauer and Senior Lieutenant Kar
ald Grosse.
Extremists of the longshoremen's
union called a half-hour strike
, SatunV'y morning as a protest
against the supression by Hitler
of communism in Germany. About
fifty longshoremen and twice as
j many civilians were on hand at

I Pier 37 to stage the "protest," but
were soon disbursed by police.
Lieutenant Grosse explained that,
I the Karlsruhe, a naval-officers'
i training ship primarily, was stop
ping in San Francisco as part of an
eight-months' cruise covering thous
j ands of miles. They left Kiel last
October 22 and expect to return by
June 20.
The cruiser skirted the eastern and
| western coastline of South America,
i and dropped a wreath in the ocean
where its namesake, the Karlsruhe,
! under Captain Kohler, had been
sunk during the World War. From
San Francisco the ship's itinerary
will include Vancouver, British Col
umbia, doubling back through the
Panama Canal, to Houston, Texas.
From there they will dock at Char
leston, South Carolina, whence they
will sail to Spain where the 120
cadets take their examinations prior
to returning to Germany.
The 6000-ton Karlsruhe is the third
ship of the German navy by that
name, was launched August 20, 1927,
and commissioned November 6,
1929. Its length is 174 meters, breadth
15 meters, and draught 6 meters.
Under the Versailles treaty.
Lieutenant Grosse stated. Germain
was limited to about half ,i dozen
ships of the Karlsruhe type (light-
I rruisers). a few so-railed "vest
pocket" battleships, some destroy
ers, mine sweepers, and mine
layers. but no submarines.
, Armament of the ship includes

| nine 15-cm. guns triple-turreted.
I Each turret is dedicated to the mem
| ory of some great name in German
1 naval history. There are also four
8.8 cm. guns, and twelve above-waler
torpedo-tubes in triple encasement.
The ship's engines boast a speed
|of 32 knots per hour and have a
; capacity of (i 5,000 horse-power. The
' front of the ship has the coat-of
i arms or the cily of Karlsruhe, a
! shield bearing the word "Fidelitas."
The ship does not fly the swastika,
but the black-white-and red war
| flag with the iron cross.
As an expression of good-will, the
American navy lent targets and tugs
I to the Karlsruhe last Wednesday at
San Pedro for target practice.
