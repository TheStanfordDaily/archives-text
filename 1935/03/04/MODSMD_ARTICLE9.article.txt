# THE
						MENACE OF MORE SOCIAL REGULATION
## 
### 
{Editorial)
There is a minority move at Stanford University to es-1
taMish uniform men's social regulations. A week ago in
Lin editorial the Daily pointed out the advantages and dis- j
advantages of such an attempted revision of rules. Since j
then, although these plans have not gained the sympathy j
of any appreciable number of men on the campus, never- ;
theless a definite attempt is being made to push them
through.
Attempting uniform regulations between groups of j
men whose environmental conditions of living on the cam- |
pus differ is hazardous. There are 21 fraternities and
four dormitories. Each house lias some type of national
ruling regarding social rules, and all in all, these rules are '
standardized for the Greeks.
On the other hand, Encina Hall, composed of freshmen, '
would be subject to no additional discipline whatsoever!
bv a set of n*'\v regulations, since now only the restricted
area of their lobby is ever used for any social function. ;
There would arise the curious paradox that although En-j
cilia freshmen would be subject to no further regulations,!
sophomores, juniors, and seniors elsewhere on the Farm
wuuld be more restricted than in the past.
There are other very important factors to consider be
fore attempting to clamp onto college men additional rules |
of social behavior. Not only is the attempt to establish !
uniformity between How and Hall irreconcilable, but it is I
very definitely opposed by students, who believe the trend j
should be toward more self-government rather than more!
restriction. ,
At the meeting to discuss such regulations last week, i
although the presidents of Hranncr and Toyon* halls were
invited to participate, the Interclub Council of the halls,!
which had passed a resolution against further social regu-,
iations, was not asked to participate in the discussion.
A.S.S.I'. President Kalin, who has initiated the idea of |
more social regulations, fails to realize one point. Last'
year a group of students conferred with President Hay
Lyman Wilbur and as a result of their talk concluded that
the men of Stanford could be relied upon to feel that the
code of a Stanford gentleman, and compliance with the
honor code tempered with existing regulations, was assur
ance enough that social rules would not be violated. I nfill
Ibis is proved to be otherwise, the Daily feels that these
existing beliefs arc guarantee enough that campus men will
live up to the obligations required of them, with no neces
sity for additional ones to be tacked on.
There is one final argument against further social regu
lations on the campus. Some number of years ago the one
o'clock'dances were established on the campus. On the
other hand, less than a year ago a rule was established
which allows campus women 2:.'}() lockouts after dances,
instead of the old 1 :^() after-dance regulation. Any such
attempt to regulate the hours when women are to leave:
houses and dormitories after one o'clock dances is at the!
same time an attempt to reconcile an old rule with a new
ruling, and the result will be failure.
To discuss the situation and honestly attempt to enforce
existing regulations is to the advantage of everyone, but to
attempt uniform regulation on a campus so heterogene
ously housed as is the Stanford campus will result only in
a more perplexing situation.
