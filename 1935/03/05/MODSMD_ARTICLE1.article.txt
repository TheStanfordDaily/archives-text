# Board Refuses To Revoke Licenses for Menlo Park Liquor
## Dealers Win Over Stanford In Heated Argument On Dry Zone 
### 
SACRAMENTO, March 4 (/P)—
Menlo Park liquor dealers won a
temporary victory over Stanford
University authorities today when,
after a stormy two-hour hearing, the
State Board of Equalization refused
to revoke Menlo Park licenses.
Board members later said a defi
nite decision would he made in a
few days.
Representatives of the University,
City of Menlo Park, and Menlo Park
liquor dealers engaged in a boister
ous squabble before the board during
the heated session.
At its conclusion, Comptroller
Afinon E. Roth, representing the
University, made the threat tIW
Stanford authorities would ask
State Hoard to close all liquor es
tablishments within one and a half
miles of the original Leland Stan
ford grant.
Only a portion of the original
grant was classed as "campus" by the
University trustees in the present
dispute.
Says Map Wrong
Assemblyman William Hornblow
er represented the liquor interests
at the hearing and Attorney J.
O'Keefe presented the case of the
City of Menlo Park.
O'Keefe argued that a map pre
sented by University authorities
did not show the true boundaries
of Stanford University, and de
manded that the board refuse to
cancel Menlo Park licenses until
they were determined.
Hornblower urged that no action
be taken until the lines were set
tled by a court case. He challenged
University authorities to swear out
a warrant. He urged the board not to
injure dealers.
Roth asked for a revocation, as
serting that "every Menlo Park
dealer selling liquor knew its s,*de
within one and a half miles of the
University campus was illegal."
Only three board members at
tended the meeting. None of them
would commit themselves.
Bar at S.U.—No!
James Corbett, one oi them, asked,
"Isn't it a fact that a bar is main
tained on the Stanford campus?"
University officials indignantly de
nied such was the case.
Comptroller Roth said, "Any im
plication that Stanford consents to
the sale of beer or liquor on the
campus is a gross falsehood."
Hornblower declared that the law
forbidding the sale of liquor within
the one and a half mile' boundary
of Stanford will be changed by the
Legislature in the next session.
