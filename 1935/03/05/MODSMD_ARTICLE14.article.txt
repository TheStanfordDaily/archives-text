# F.R. Favors Shipping Aid

WASHINGTON, March 4 </P) -
( Proposing an end to the "subterfuge"
of "disguised subsidies," President
Roosevelt gave Congress by special
; message today three reasons why he
j thought this country should main
[ tain an adequate merchant marine
! under an outright subsidy plan.
Two congressional committees
' promptly squared for action. First
! reactions indicated sufiicient senti
ment to carry his proposals forward.
But with the crush of other affairs
in Congress there appeared little
likelihood of action.
The presidential message put di
; rectly to Congress the question "of
j whether or not the United States
i should have an adequate merchant
marine." Then, sharply, he added
that if Congress decided in the iffTir
mative, "it can well afford honestly
to call a subsidy by its right name."
In giving his own three reasons,
the President pointed out, first, that
i other nations give peace time subsi
dies to their shipping, and that
j "maintenance of fair competition
alone" called for a sufficient number
! of American Flag ships to carry "a
reasonable portion of our foreign
I commerce."
