# Two Investigators Report Bawl-Out Variations by Quarters and Classes
## 
### 
First quarter freshmen, not know
ing the ropes, study hard and go
plus four. Second quarter freshmen,
knowing the ropes, study less hard
and go minus eight. Third quarter
freshmen, hating to be minus, study
harder still ar.d go plus eight.
Sophomores hit the books in the
fall, coast during the winter, and
slide during the spring to wind up
plus 20. Juniors rise up to plus 75 in
March and slip down to plus 60 in
June. Seniors rocket their averages
up to plus 150 during the fall and
then drop drastically to pKis 80 when
they graduate.
Such are the findings of Betty Ju
dell. sophomore, and her father, who
went through thr current Bawl-out,
adding up the various totals with

' out the aid of machines, just to see
who did the most studying, when.
; and why.
The findings of the self-appointed
i statisticians were based on averages,
found by placing all under-grad
uates in 12 groups, each one a mul
tiple of fifteen, the average number
of units carried per quarter by each
j student. The result gave a good
I cross-section of Stanford under
• graduate academic life.
With the exception of the fresh
men, all students make worse grades
in the spring quarter than during
j the rest of the year, spring lassitude
| being the obvious reason. In the fall
everyone studies and the average
student goes at least plus 15. And in
i the winter the tendency is toward
I status quo.

i Certain large groupings of students
provided the most significant fact in
] the Judell survey — the fact that
I those students who entered in the
fall as freshmen do better uniformly
during all four years than those who
enter at odd times with units al
! ready to their credit. The former
group proceeds at an average of plus
10 units per quarter when they are
| underclassmen and at an average of
plus 20 when uppercla^smen—bar
ring of course the last two quarters
i of the senior year when the average
of nearly everybody decreases.
Revealed also in the study was the
fact that the average grade of Stan
ford students was not C or "0" in
the bawl-out. Rather it was at a
level which could be described either
' as C phis or 13 minus.
