# MARTY TO JUMP IN I.C.4.A. MEET
## 
### 
j Walter Marty, world's high jump
! champion, yesterday definitely de
clared his intentions of entering the
! Stanford all-University track meet
I Sat urday on Angell Field.
Track fans, remembering Marty's
1 thrilling performance at the first all-
University meet last spring, arc now
looking forward to a high jump duel
between Marty and Humbert Smith
of the Stanford varsity.
Marty yesterday mentioned the
! fact that he is in only "fair" shape,
which means that probably a mere
G feet 6 inches will be the winning
height Saturday. Smith this spring
has been displaying his best form
1 ever in the few afternoons he has
j jumped. Should he hit his expected
6 feet 3 inches or better, Saturday's
high jumping should provide some of
the classiest competition the Coast
j will see this year.
Last year Marty made a hurried
I trip to Stanford after staying up
| most of the night as guest of honor
| for a Fresno social function, and,
J without rest, jumped lor the world's
j record, barely missing, but giving
j the fans one of the greatest high
I jumping performances of the year.
Tomorrow Skull and Snakes,
j backers of the benefit meet, and
| their aides will cover the campus
| for the sale of tickets, priced at 25
| cents for students and 55 cents for
j ihe general public.
