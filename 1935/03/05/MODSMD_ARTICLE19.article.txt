### Barbara Sweet 
Ten-year-old prodigy pianist Ruth
Slenczynski will appear in concert
tonight at 8:20 o'clock in the Pavi
lion under the auspices of the A.S.
S.U. Concert Series.
Ruth's father, a violinist, has de-
I voted most of his time to training
! his daughter, since he suffered
wounds while fighting in Franee that
i handicapped his own musical career.
; His first care was to see that she
i heard plenty of good music, well
i played. When she passed her third
' birthday her father began her in
| structions and bought her a piano.
From that time she learned music
under strict discipline.
Plays ?\t Mills
At Mills College, Dr. Reinhardt,
the president, took an immediate in
terest. in her, and offered the use of
: the auditorium in which to give a
j concert. The audience of the result
; ing concert was composed chiefly of
1 educators and discriminating music
' lovers who, recognizing her genius,
i collected a fund of $12,000 as a means
' of enabling her father to take Ruth
to Europe, where she might be
taught by the great masters of the
piano.
Ruth does not play any of the
modern composers. She does not
like them. When asked why, she re
! plied, "Because their compositions
I are so full of dissonanoe, I cannot
; follow the line of melody."
