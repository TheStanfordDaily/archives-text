### 
SAN FRANCISCO, March 4 (/Pi-
Speaking over e state-wide radio
hookup, a forthright endorsement of
the basic provisions of the Townsend
old age pension plan was given by
Governor Frank Merriam.
The Governor heralded the pen
sion theory of the Long Beach doc
tor as a model worthy of being used
as a foundation of any federal and
stale legislation.
"I have seen no specific proposals
for old age relief which in their basic
principles are as workable as the
Townsend plan," said the Governor.
Granting that certain modifications
and adjustments in the plan may be
found advisable, Dr. Townsend's rec
ommendations have my approval
and will continue to have my
support."
