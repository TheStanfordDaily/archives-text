# U.S. IMMIGRATION NEEDS DISCUSSED
## Reynolds Surveys Subject For Radio Audience 
### 
There are three reasons why the
- immigration policy of the United
! States is of special interest today,
Dr. C. N. Reynolds told the Stan
! ford radio hour audience over station
KGO at 8 o'clock last night.
"Our natural gain in population
seems to be disappearing; millions
of our own workers are unemployed;
j and our internal problems demand a
■ well-organized and socially homo
! geneous population for their solu
j tion," stated Dr. Reynolds, profes
j sor of sociology at Stanford.
Tells History
He made a survey of the dramatic
i and interesting immigration history
j of the United States since the Revo
j lutionary War. "In several in
stances," Reynolds said, "more than
j a million arrived during a single
year. After 1890, during the period
of rapid industrialization, the immi
grants from .eastern and southern
. Europe began to supplant those from
!the British Empire, Germany, and
! the Scandinavian countries. Proc
esses of assimilation became slower
land we began to be conscious of im
j migration problems in different and
j more significant ways."
J Professor Reynolds outlined the
system of deportation and compli-
I cated administrative organization for
excluding the many undesirable
| types, which was accelerated by dan
gers of the World War. During the
depression legislation has checked
immigration to such an extent that
I the United States has witnessed the
; strange phenomenon of seeing itself
! as a country of emigration.
Fixed Policy Needed
Relating this declining immigra-
I tion to the field of sociology, Profes
! sor Reynolds believes that it is one
of the chief measures necessary to
I insure social solidarity. "It is still
: legally possible for any number of
! immigrants to come in annually
j from countries of the Western Hem
j isphere, and both Canadians and
Mexicans have shown themselves
Sable to seize this opportunity," Dr.
I Reynolds said in discussing the need
jfor a permanent policy.
He concluded with the statement
' that we are going through a crisis in
American affairs, and that in up
holding permanently enforced immi
gration legislation one must be aware
that while we insure social solidarity
of serious internal problems, at the
; same time we realize that it must
; be adjusted to the rapidly declining
rate of population gain. This de-
I creasing rate is the combined result
of loss of child-bearing group of
, immigrant women and the increased
: use of birth-control methods in
American society.

: use of birth-control methods in
American society.
There are three reasons why the
- immigration policy of the United
! States is of special interest today,
Dr. C. N. Reynolds told the Stan
! ford radio hour audience over station
KGO at 8 o'clock last night.
"Our natural gain in population
seems to be disappearing; millions
of our own workers are unemployed;
j and our internal problems demand a
■ well-organized and socially homo
! geneous population for their solu
j tion," stated Dr. Reynolds, profes
j sor of sociology at Stanford.
Tells History
He made a survey of the dramatic
i and interesting immigration history
j of the United States since the Revo
j lutionary War. "In several in
stances," Reynolds said, "more than
j a million arrived during a single
year. After 1890, during the period
of rapid industrialization, the immi
grants from .eastern and southern
. Europe began to supplant those from
!the British Empire, Germany, and
! the Scandinavian countries. Proc
esses of assimilation became slower
land we began to be conscious of im
j migration problems in different and
j more significant ways."
J Professor Reynolds outlined the
system of deportation and compli-
I cated administrative organization for
excluding the many undesirable
| types, which was accelerated by dan
gers of the World War. During the
depression legislation has checked
immigration to such an extent that
I the United States has witnessed the
; strange phenomenon of seeing itself
! as a country of emigration.
Fixed Policy Needed
Relating this declining immigra-
I tion to the field of sociology, Profes
! sor Reynolds believes that it is one
of the chief measures necessary to
I insure social solidarity. "It is still
: legally possible for any number of
! immigrants to come in annually
j from countries of the Western Hem
j isphere, and both Canadians and
Mexicans have shown themselves
Sable to seize this opportunity," Dr.
I Reynolds said in discussing the need
jfor a permanent policy.
He concluded with the statement
' that we are going through a crisis in
American affairs, and that in up
holding permanently enforced immi
gration legislation one must be aware
that while we insure social solidarity
of serious internal problems, at the
; same time we realize that it must
; be adjusted to the rapidly declining
rate of population gain. This de-
I creasing rate is the combined result
of loss of child-bearing group of
, immigrant women and the increased
: use of birth-control methods in
American society.
