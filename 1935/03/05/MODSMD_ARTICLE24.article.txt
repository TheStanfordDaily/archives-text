# Editorial on Social Probe Brings Reply By A.S.S.U. Head
## Controversy on Social Regulations Originated Because Some Thought Honor Code Insufficient To Stop Questionable Practices 
### IRVIN JORGENSEN 
Latest development in the social regulations controversy was a state
ment from Marvie Kahn, A.S.S.U. president, protesting against yesterday's
front page editorial.
The fire that has caused all this social regulations smoke was kindled
; first when it was said that Stanford's Honor Code had not been sufficient

►to prevent questionable practices at
| hall and fraternity dances.
i Kahn says that he is attempting
i only to show both fraternities and
j halls that they can avert criticism
| and possible faculty regulation by
| adopting a uniform understanding of
j existant rules.
One step that was taken towards
this by the delegates of Thurs
| day's social regulations conference
j of hall and fraternity men was *\n
agreement that there should be
j student police at all campus dances
j and that they should be instructed
to report any "conduct unbecom-
J ing" to the student committees of
the living groups.
The big wishbone on which the
; committeemen choked, and which
| has caused the major part of the
| controversy, is the diversity of opin
l ion over the old problem of allow
ing women to visit men's rooms dur
ing dances.
Despite Kahn's statement that no
steps have been taken to impose
additional regulations on men, how
! ever, one definite move has already
I been agreed upon at last Thursday's
j conference, and several more will
i be considered.
Kahn Makes Statement
Kahn's reply to yesterday's edi
! torial, charging him with heading a
I minority movement to inflict social
! regulations is as follows:
"It is too bad that The Daily has
1 failed to investigate the so-called
|'social regulation movement'. I can
! not see why an honest attempt by
j campus leaders to come to a common
i understanding about their social
l code is 'hazardous'.
I "Why has The Daily continued
| to harp on 'regulation'? This has
i been its own idea of the purpose
| of these conferences, not the opin
i ion of the unofficial committee.
"Not one step has been taken to
j clamp any additional rules for so
i cial behavior. Where did the paper
I get such an idea?
"I shall personally U:ke the blame
! for not inviting the Interclub Coun
i cil to the first conference. Previously
j I was told by that body that it was
'an unofficial hall organ. However,
; I have invited the Interclub Board
I to the next conference because last
i Friday I sat in on the meeting in
which the board declared it was
an official body.
"Also, I will admit that I ini
tiated the idea of having the groups
meet. However, the conference was
not directed along lines to inflict
! rules on anybody.
| "1 openly invite members of the
I Editorial Board of The Daily to sit
j in on the next conference. By that
means, perhaps, the Associated Stu
] dents can obtain a true picture of the
proceedings.—Marvin Kahn."
