# A 						Western Editor Dies
## 
### 
One of the most picturesque of the Western
editors passed away Sunday, alter an active
career of over fifty years in San Francisco.
Fremont Older was not the type of journal
ist of whom biographies could be written,
stressing his noble virtues or his domineering
character in gaining recognition in journal
istic fields, t'nlike the Pulitzers and the
Danas and other figures of American journal
ism, Older's was a simple and unaffected
character.
To say that he was never touched by the
linger of financial temptations would not be
entirely true. Early in I<S9."> Older started his
newspaper career as the managing editor of
the San Francisco Bulletin. In the campaign
which elected the wealthy young James Phe
lan mayor of the city, there were instances of
political maneuvers affecting the liulletin
which were not exactly prompted by higher
motives. In Older's own words, speaking of
his early career, he said: "The fact that we
were taking money from the railroad, the gas
company, and other public-looting corpora
tions was well known in the business office."
It was not in these early days thai Fremont
Older gained his reputation as a fearless lead
er of what he termed graft and corruption in
San Francisco. It was later in his career that
Older became enraged against the foul prac
tices of what was then one of the most graft
ridden cities in the country. His newspaper
lights against the Abe Huef and Eugene
Sehmitz political machine, leading eventually
to Ruef's conviction and sentence to San
Ouentin, were the start of crusading tactics
which led Older into many newspaper cam
paigns.
For fifteen years Fremont Older continued
as a managing editor, taking a newspaper that
was losing many thousands of dollars and
building it up to a leading metropolitan paper
lashing out against monopolies and conditions
of vice. To Older the idea that the newspaper
was a powerful moral force in the community
was paramount, and motivated his career as
an editor.
As the editor of the Call-Bulletin, Fremont
Older did not earn great plaudits from the
reading public, and particularly from the en
virons of the Stanford campus, where for
some years incidental happenings of univer
sity life saw themselves often transposed to
black headlines in the late afternoon editions
of the city paper. Hut as an individual, men
had nothing but respect for this man whose
integrity was unimpeachable.
In his later years Older interested himself
in the reform of people in all walks of life,
and many were the ex-convicts and other un
fortunates whom Older befriended, and who
were to be seen at bis Santa Clara ranch serv
ing this journalist they learned to admire.
Indefatigable in his work up to the last day,
Fremont Older emphasizes the type of jour
nalist whose fighting independence and zeal
for public betterment could be emulated as an
ideal by many college journalists seeking a
place in the newspaper world.

Older became enraged against the foul prac
tices of what was then one of the most graft
ridden cities in the country. His newspaper
lights against the Abe Huef and Eugene
Sehmitz political machine, leading eventually
to Ruef's conviction and sentence to San
Ouentin, were the start of crusading tactics
which led Older into many newspaper cam

For fifteen years Fremont Older continued
as a managing editor, taking a newspaper that
was losing many thousands of dollars and
building it up to a leading metropolitan paper
lashing out against monopolies and conditions
of vice. To Older the idea that the newspaper
was a powerful moral force in the community
was paramount, and motivated his career as
an editor.
As the editor of the Call-Bulletin, Fremont
Older did not earn great plaudits from the
reading public, and particularly from the en
virons of the Stanford campus, where for
some years incidental happenings of univer
sity life saw themselves often transposed to
black headlines in the late afternoon editions
of the city paper. Hut as an individual, men
had nothing but respect for this man whose
integrity was unimpeachable.
In his later years Older interested himself
in the reform of people in all walks of life,
and many were the ex-convicts and other un
fortunates whom Older befriended, and who
were to be seen at bis Santa Clara ranch serv
ing this journalist they learned to admire.
Indefatigable in his work up to the last day,
Fremont Older emphasizes the type of jour
nalist whose fighting independence and zeal
for public betterment could be emulated as an
ideal by many college journalists seeking a
place in the newspaper world.
One of the most picturesque of the Western

Fremont Older was not the type of journal
ist of whom biographies could be written,
stressing his noble virtues or his domineering
character in gaining recognition in journal
istic fields, t'nlike the Pulitzers and the
Danas and other figures of American journal
ism, Older's was a simple and unaffected
character.
To say that he was never touched by the
linger of financial temptations would not be
entirely true. Early in I<S9."> Older started his
newspaper career as the managing editor of
the San Francisco Bulletin. In the campaign
which elected the wealthy young James Phe
lan mayor of the city, there were instances of
political maneuvers affecting the liulletin
which were not exactly prompted by higher
motives. In Older's own words, speaking of
his early career, he said: "The fact that we
were taking money from the railroad, the gas
company, and other public-looting corpora
tions was well known in the business office."
It was not in these early days thai Fremont
Older gained his reputation as a fearless lead
er of what he termed graft and corruption in
San Francisco. It was later in his career that
