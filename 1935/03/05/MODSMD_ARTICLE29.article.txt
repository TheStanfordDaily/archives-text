# A 						Genuine Artist Appears Tonight
## 
### 
Not a "child wonder" nor a curiosity, but
an artist already acclaimed as a great musi
cian, ten-year-old Ruth Slenczynski (Slenzin
sky) appears in recital here tonight.
Too many "child prodigies" have flared up
in recent years to startle the world, only to
sink later into burned-out oblivion. Rut here
we find a child who, by careful and moderate
training since she first showed a spark of
genius, h:is been developed into a phenomenal
concert artist whose talent will delight the
world's musical audiences for years to come.
With interest in tonight's performance here
already heightened by the fact that she is a
resident of San Francisco, young Miss Slen
czynski should draw a good crowd from the
campus and Palo Alto 10 liear the music which
lias thrilled packed houses on both sides of
the world.
