## 
### 
MIAMI. Fla., March 4 </P)â€”Joseph
M. Schenk, representing Metro-
Goldwyn-Mayer, proposed today
that Florida raise $10,000,000 by pop
ular subscription to build motion
pictures studios to be rented to the
industry for a stipulated $250,000 a
year.
Schenk said the industry is appre
hensive of California's tendencies
toward "soaking the rich," as exem
plified in the bill providing a 35 per
cent tax on industrial incomes, and
is ready to move.
First demand of the industry, if it
migrates, he stated, will be for guar
antees against future "gouging" by
tax authorities. For this reason, he
explained, it will ask that the peo
ple's money be invested in the phy
sical plants at a specified interest
per cent.
Schenk plans to confer Wednes
day with Sidney Kent, president of
Fox Studios, at Boca Raton.
Fox. he said, as well as the other
major companies. Paramount and
RKO, would be fore d to join an
exodus from California if the income
tax is levied.
