## WITH THOMAS S. BARCLAY 
### john McClelland, '37 
The stupendous shock which industrial and financial
occurences of the last six troublesome years have
brought upon our economic system has caused many
an American to stop arid reflect. To preserve democ
racy and at the same time secure a form of govern
ment capable of coping with new conditions has been
the problem.
Professor Thomas S. Barclay is one of those who has
paused to reflect, and he is one of the few who have
formed sound conclusions in suggesting governmental
changes. Last Saturday the political science professor,
speaking before an alumni group, summed up the
causes of present conditions and told what he con
sidered to be the necessary steps for a successful tran
sition in the American form of democracy.
Three sets of forces acting together are believed by
Professor Barclay to be the most important in in
fluencing and determining the lives and fortunes of
men today.
These in brief are: (1) the destruction of accum
ulated capital, the disruption of the world's trade,
the breakdown of international relationships, and
the ending of a system which had been building
for MOO years—all results of the World War; (2)
technological advancements creating unemploy
ment; (II) the problems arising as a result of the
post-war period with which a cumbersome parlia
mentary government was unfitted to deal.
Concerning this last cause, Professor Barclay said:
"The truth is that representative government in the
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries had operated
almost entirely in the field of politics, End most of the
great governmental struggles had been over political
issues."
Professor Barclay recognized that such forms of
government as Communism and Fascism are unaccept
able to the American people but that "new forms of
representative institutions must evolve and the old
forms must be altered if what is called democracy is
to survive."
"As the business of government becomes more
and more complex . . . the task laid upon existing
institutions becomes more and more unbearable.
And as the conditions of the people change, the
functions of government must change."
With this statement, Professor Barclay explained
the necessity for changes in government which will
involve accepting unfamiliar governmental policies for
the purpose of achieving possible relief. "We must
be prepared to adapt existing institutions to present day
economic and social needs and to guarantee that 'liberty
is more than a parade ground for selfish ambition',"
he said.
Two governmental readjustments were sug
gested by Professor Barclay. The first involves the
permanent establishment of a more responsible re
lationship between the executive and legislative
branches of the national government. It is his
belief that the conditions under the present admin
istration where "effective government was achieved
without abandoning democracy" is a beginning
toward this end.
The second readjustment involves: relieving Con
gress from the necessity of considering vast masses of
private and local legislation, making it possible for
it to concentrate on the more important legislative
matters; sessions of congress without adjournment;
the establishment of a permanent joint congressional
investigation committee; the charging of the system
whereby the pressure of minority groups is the con
trolling factor in legislation and where there is a
premium on particular interests as against the general
interest; and the altering of the balance of power
between Congress and the President so that "repre
sentative government may be reduced from the with
ering cross-fire of sectional selfishness and of pressure
groups."
Professor Barclay believes that the whole
process of readjustment involves the "reconcilia
tion of government and liberty," and that "in the
eternal struggle between constancy and change, the
great task of democratic government is to provide
and maintain both freedom and security."

issues."
Professor Barclay recognized that such forms of
government as Communism and Fascism are unaccept
able to the American people but that "new forms of
representative institutions must evolve and the old
forms must be altered if what is called democracy is
to survive."
"As the business of government becomes more
and more complex . . . the task laid upon existing
institutions becomes more and more unbearable.
And as the conditions of the people change, the
functions of government must change."
With this statement, Professor Barclay explained
the necessity for changes in government which will
involve accepting unfamiliar governmental policies for
the purpose of achieving possible relief. "We must
be prepared to adapt existing institutions to present day
economic and social needs and to guarantee that 'liberty
is more than a parade ground for selfish ambition',"
he said.
Two governmental readjustments were sug
gested by Professor Barclay. The first involves the
permanent establishment of a more responsible re
lationship between the executive and legislative
branches of the national government. It is his
belief that the conditions under the present admin
istration where "effective government was achieved
without abandoning democracy" is a beginning
toward this end.
The second readjustment involves: relieving Con
gress from the necessity of considering vast masses of
private and local legislation, making it possible for
it to concentrate on the more important legislative
matters; sessions of congress without adjournment;
the establishment of a permanent joint congressional
investigation committee; the charging of the system
whereby the pressure of minority groups is the con
trolling factor in legislation and where there is a
premium on particular interests as against the general
interest; and the altering of the balance of power
between Congress and the President so that "repre
sentative government may be reduced from the with
ering cross-fire of sectional selfishness and of pressure
groups."
Professor Barclay believes that the whole
process of readjustment involves the "reconcilia
tion of government and liberty," and that "in the
eternal struggle between constancy and change, the
great task of democratic government is to provide
and maintain both freedom and security."
The stupendous shock which industrial and financial
occurences of the last six troublesome years have
brought upon our economic system has caused many
an American to stop arid reflect. To preserve democ
racy and at the same time secure a form of govern
ment capable of coping with new conditions has been
the problem.
Professor Thomas S. Barclay is one of those who has
paused to reflect, and he is one of the few who have
formed sound conclusions in suggesting governmental
changes. Last Saturday the political science professor,
speaking before an alumni group, summed up the
causes of present conditions and told what he con
sidered to be the necessary steps for a successful tran
sition in the American form of democracy.
Three sets of forces acting together are believed by
Professor Barclay to be the most important in in
fluencing and determining the lives and fortunes of
men today.
These in brief are: (1) the destruction of accum
ulated capital, the disruption of the world's trade,
the breakdown of international relationships, and
the ending of a system which had been building
for MOO years—all results of the World War; (2)
technological advancements creating unemploy
ment; (II) the problems arising as a result of the
post-war period with which a cumbersome parlia
mentary government was unfitted to deal.
Concerning this last cause, Professor Barclay said:
"The truth is that representative government in the
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries had operated
almost entirely in the field of politics, End most of the
great governmental struggles had been over political
issues."
