Because on this day a group of Americans com
mitted one of the most bore-faced acts of injustice
against—England history—the msHg.-rtion ot tht*
so-called Boston Massacre.
Disappointed by a false fire alarm, a mob of noc
turnal mischief makers provoked the garrison of
British soldiers in Boston, throwing stones, sticks and
snow at the guards. When one Bostonidn was so rash
as to attempt to wrest the gun from the hands of a
sentry, two shots were fired and men fell dead. Eight
Britishers were arrested for murder and though John
Adams defended them and there was no evidence to
show who had done the shooting, two soldiers were
convictcd, branded, and deported.
