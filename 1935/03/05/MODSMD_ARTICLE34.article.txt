# BULL SESSION
## OUT WHERE THE WEST BEGINS—AND ENDS 
### 
When San Francisco was "The
Barbary Coast," and Los Angeles
was as yet untouched by realtors,
California was "THE WEST." It was
wild and wooly and proud of it. But
though Easterners still sneer at the
barbarity of all lands west of the
Hudson River, California has
achieved a state which may be
roughlv described as "civilized." The
Old West has fled.
When THE WEST fled from Cali
fornia, it continued residence out in
the sandy wastes of the Idahos, and
Montanas, and Nevadas. At the pres
ent time, The West exists between
the civilized urbanity of California
and the rural civility of Salt Lake
City. One of the westiest little spots
in The West is Las Vegas, Nevada.
Like most Western towns, Las
Vegas has but one real street. Once
you depart from the blazing Neon of
Fremont Street, you are oil' in the
wilds or worse. For the purposes of
generalization, Fremont Street is a
long bar interspersed with roulette
wheels. There is liquor, liquor every
where, and scarcely a drop of water.
Most saloons do a flourishing busi
ness.
If a Hollywood movie company
suddenly descended upon the gam
bling-bars of Las Vegas, and filmed
the natives in action, no one would
believe the resultant film. Sophisti
cated audiences would sneer, and
brand the thing "Hollywood stuff."
But the cigar-sucking dealers, the
slouch-hatted gamblers, the bleary
eyed and generally dirty ensemble
that fills the Boulder Club, the Las
Vegas Club, and such out-westerns
Hollywood's wildest matinee thriller.
Since the advent of Boulder (nee
Hoover) Dam construction, Las Ve
gas joints have been given a new
lease on life. There is a constant
stream of devaluated dollars from
the dam site to the Vegas poker
tables.
The Boulder Dam is unbelievable.
There's just too much of it. The dam
has already bucked up the Colorado

| River to make a lake 25 miles long,
and will eventually hold a pond
stretching back over 100 miles. First
power will tome from the dam base
! power-houses in September.
Bowlder Dam will give light and
power to the inhabitants of the
Southwest. And Las Vegas gives
color, if not power, to western United
States.

When San Francisco was "The
Barbary Coast," and Los Angeles
was as yet untouched by realtors,
California was "THE WEST." It was
wild and wooly and proud of it. But
though Easterners still sneer at the
barbarity of all lands west of the
Hudson River, California has
achieved a state which may be
roughlv described as "civilized." The
Old West has fled.
When THE WEST fled from Cali
fornia, it continued residence out in
the sandy wastes of the Idahos, and
Montanas, and Nevadas. At the pres
ent time, The West exists between
the civilized urbanity of California
and the rural civility of Salt Lake
City. One of the westiest little spots
in The West is Las Vegas, Nevada.
Like most Western towns, Las
Vegas has but one real street. Once
you depart from the blazing Neon of
Fremont Street, you are oil' in the
wilds or worse. For the purposes of
generalization, Fremont Street is a
long bar interspersed with roulette
wheels. There is liquor, liquor every
where, and scarcely a drop of water.
Most saloons do a flourishing busi
ness.
If a Hollywood movie company
suddenly descended upon the gam
bling-bars of Las Vegas, and filmed
the natives in action, no one would
believe the resultant film. Sophisti
cated audiences would sneer, and
brand the thing "Hollywood stuff."
But the cigar-sucking dealers, the
slouch-hatted gamblers, the bleary
eyed and generally dirty ensemble
that fills the Boulder Club, the Las
Vegas Club, and such out-westerns
Hollywood's wildest matinee thriller.
Since the advent of Boulder (nee
Hoover) Dam construction, Las Ve
gas joints have been given a new
lease on life. There is a constant
stream of devaluated dollars from
the dam site to the Vegas poker
tables.
The Boulder Dam is unbelievable.
There's just too much of it. The dam
has already bucked up the Colorado

| River to make a lake 25 miles long,
and will eventually hold a pond
stretching back over 100 miles. First
power will tome from the dam base
! power-houses in September.
Bowlder Dam will give light and
