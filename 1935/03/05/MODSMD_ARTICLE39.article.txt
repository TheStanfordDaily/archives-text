# MURAL SWIMMING ENTRIES TO MEET FOR TRIALS TODAY
## Diving Tryouts, Finals In All Events Scheduled For Tomorrow 
### Craig Barbash 
Encirta Pools will be the scene
of the intramural swimming cham
pionships at four o'clock this after
noon when some 150 mermen from
29 organizations meet for trials in
five events prior to tomorrow's finals.
The anc l 150-yard free styles,
the 75-yard breaststroke, the 75-yard
backstroke, and the four-man, 200-
yard free style relay will be con
tested today. Finals in these events,
and the trials and finals in diving
will complete the championships
tomorrow.
Twelve divers must wait until
12:15 o'clock tomorrow for trials and
finals. In the meantime the field of
69 entries in the short sprint will
have been cut down, as will the field
of 49 in the longer free style event.
Eliminations Today
Today's eliminations y/i 11 weed
out a majority of the thirty-odd en
tries in both the breast and back
stroke events, and the 19 relay
entries.
An attack on records, plus the
award of 20 points toward the intra
mural trophy to the winner brings
out a near-record number of com
petitors, and adds incentive for
heated competition.
Phil Bateson's 24.5 second record
for the 50-yard sprint seems farthest
from going into discard, though
about a half-dozen men are within
range, and out-doing themselves,
might eclipse it.
The rest of the marks are under
fire, especially in the 75-yard back
stroke where Bob Etienne, Beta, will
be out to better his record of 52.9
seconds.
Records In Danger
The mark of 54.7 seconds for the
75-yard breaststroke held by Par
mer Fuller, Alpha Delt, '34, faces
serious challenge, as does Bill Ers
kine's mark of 1:40 for the 150-yard
free style. Erskine, a Delt, will not
defend his title.
Harry Baskerville, Kappa Sig,
whose points in diving is the
present record, is graduated and will
not compete. The present crop of
divers will be out to eclipse his rec
ord total for six dives.
Tht! record to beat in the relay is
1:54, held by Delta Tail Delta.
Five entry points are awarded each
organization with four or mere men
competing.
