# New Dances To Be Given By Orchesis
## Original Numbers Slated Tomorrow Night 
### 
Featuring original dances created
by members of Orchesis, women's
dancing society, a program will be
presented tomorrow night in the
Dance Studio.
The program is divided into four
parts, the first of which includes
three dances from Alice in Wonder
land representing the Mock Turtle,
the Seashore Quadrille, and the Cro
quet Gairle. In these dances are the
characters made famous by Lewis
Carroll's book. Alice, the Queen of
Hearts, the Big Fish, the Mad Hat
ter, and the Walrus will all be seen,
each in his or her own characteristic
poses. The music which will be used
has been especially written for Alice
in Wonderland.
Impressions portrayed by individ
uals will be included in the second
group. Students have been working
on masks, which will add to the gen
eral effect.
A cycle representing Supplication,
Realization, and Exultation will
make up the third group of dances.
Moods of the Night, presenting five
different aspects of night, will con
clude the program.
Free tickets to the dance program
may still be had at the A.S.S.U.
offices today and tomoriow. Those
who have tickets which they are not
going to use are requested to return
them to the A.S.S.U. office.
