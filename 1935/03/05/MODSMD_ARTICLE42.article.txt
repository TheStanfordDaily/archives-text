## ALL-CONFERENCE QUINTET 
### 
•
Feeling that the observations of
eight conference tilts and discrep
ancies witn previously chosen all
conference fives justifies it, this col
umnist herewith issues an ail-con
ference quintet for the season just
closed.
For the outstanding man in the
league and for the center position
—Libro "Leeping Lee' Guttero,
Trojan pivot man. Enjoying his
third great year, Guttero smashed
all previous conference games for
high scoring. He scored high
against all teams and in every
g une, that's why he gets the choice
over Captain Dave Meek of Cali
fornia.
Meek probably played his most
effective games against the Indians,
but did not score consistently against
the U.S.C. defense. His beautifully
executed overhead swisher is the

prettiest shot seen in the Pavilion
this year. Sophomore John "Goon '
Ball of the Bruins <s a comer* but
didn't justify his label as the "find
of the year" in his two appearances
at Stanford. He's grown so last that
he hasn't even the usual amount of
coordination of an 18-year-old, but
his height and spring will make him
hard to handle in his tv/o remaining
seasons.
