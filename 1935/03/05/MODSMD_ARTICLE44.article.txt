# FORWARDS HUPP AND KOPKE
## 
### 
Jack Hupp of the Trojans and
"Cocky" Jack Kopke of the Bears
are the forward choices. Hupp is the
most valuable, making his field goals
out of the range of the opposing de
fense, his long shot is easily the most
consistent on the Coast. His second
game in the Pavilion here was one
of his rare low-score evenings.
Kopke was the ball-hawk and sup
plied the pepper for the Golden
Bears, second place winners, who
should have a man on the first five,
even though Guttero is better than
their logical man, Meek. With a one
handed flyer that found the net reg
ularly against Stanford, the little
U.C. forward was the best at his po
sition for trick shots, something ex
pected of forwards since the days of
Jerry Nerner of the Trojans.
S.C.'s Ernie Holbrook is a great
forward, but his scoring power was
sacrificed to feed Guttero.
