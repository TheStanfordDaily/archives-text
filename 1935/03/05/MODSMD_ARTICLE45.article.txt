# GUARDS—ORAM AND MOORE
## 
### 
At the guard posts, Eddie Oram
of the Trojans and our own Bryan
"Dinty" Moore of Farm hoop fame.
Oram only broke into the first
string line-up when Captain "Bark
ing Joe" Kelly was rendered hors de
combat in a moment of over-enthu
siasm during a Bear-Trojan tilt, but
his floor work, his frequent field
goals, and the regularity with which
he received the rebounds from the
backboard makes him the most fully
qualified of all coast guards. Two
years to go.
Moore's play has been adequa
tely described here. It was his four,
five, and six field goals per evening
which kept the Indians in more
than one bail game. He's way
ahead of the other conference
guards in scoring. No matter how
far the were trailing. Dinty
would come pounding down the
floor with the same immovable de
termination. When there wasn't a
man free he dribbled through the
defense to store himself, and his
one-handcr is the most spectacular
shot of tin- year. Despite his sopho
more standing, he made good as a
captain, and is our idea of the most
valuable man to his team that the
conference produced.
