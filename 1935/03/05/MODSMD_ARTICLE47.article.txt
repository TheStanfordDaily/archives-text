# Flying Instructor Commends Air-Mindedness of Stanford
## Stanford Men, Women Take To Sky Like Veterans, Says Airman 
### Robert Eisenbach 
To the parents of Stanford stu
\ dents, flying may be a dangerous and
thrilling experience, but to their sons
and daughters, doing «ide-slips or an
; eight-on-pylon is no move exciting
! than making a left turn in the fam
ily chariot or bowling along at 50
per on the Bayshore.
They learn to fly as other people
learn to drive, according to Joseph F.
Donovan, manager of the Palo Alto
School of Aviation.
Not live of the forty fledglings
who keep instructors and planes
busy are out to learn professional
aviation, a significant attitude, Dono
van believes. Most of them major in
everything but aeronautical engi
neering while in their classes. Near
ly all are out for the amateur licensc,
aviation's ordinary flying permit, and
only three hope to make money from
their experience, school records
show.
Forward-Looking Pupils
By and large, they are a forwnrd
i looking lot, Mr. Donovan has found,
1 preparing for the day when knowl
edge of aviation will be expected of
job-holders in big corporations.
"There's a real love of flying in
these fellows," he points out. "They'll
do most anything to pay for their
I course. We have them remitting by
i the lesson, week, month, and some
times paying for the entire course in
, advance out of their allowances."
As a result, Stanford students have
j the distinction of being the most air

minded group in the United States.
A total of 500 flying hours per quar
ter, or 1500 per fiscal year (October
to June) is the school's record, sur
passing that of the Minnesota Uni
versity aeronautical school, interna-
I tionally recognized last year as hav
| ing the greatest number of air hours
! of any American college. Stanford's
' rating is unofficial, however, for the
' local flying school is separate from
| the university.
Preston Is Chief
Lieut. John B. Preston, former
Stanford student, and now chief in
structor at the school, is responsible

I for this achievement.
He has guided hundreds of stu
dents through their first terrifying
hours in the air, and his experience
shows that Stanfordites have an un
; usually high "air-aptitude."
Professorial opinion to the con
trary, Stanford»men and women are
smart, and darned smart, when they
want to be," he declared. "They take
to a plane like veterans. Even our
; two girl students, Yvonne Beatty and
Marjorie Kitselman, fly with control
and good judgment, despite the fact
| that the mechanics of aviation aren't
'.exactly a woman's forte."

minded group in the United States.
A total of 500 flying hours per quar
ter, or 1500 per fiscal year (October
to June) is the school's record, sur
passing that of the Minnesota Uni
versity aeronautical school, interna-
I tionally recognized last year as hav
| ing the greatest number of air hours
! of any American college. Stanford's
' rating is unofficial, however, for the
' local flying school is separate from
| the university.
Preston Is Chief
Lieut. John B. Preston, former
Stanford student, and now chief in
structor at the school, is responsible

I for this achievement.
He has guided hundreds of stu
dents through their first terrifying
hours in the air, and his experience
shows that Stanfordites have an un
; usually high "air-aptitude."
Professorial opinion to the con
trary, Stanford»men and women are
smart, and darned smart, when they
want to be," he declared. "They take
to a plane like veterans. Even our
; two girl students, Yvonne Beatty and
Marjorie Kitselman, fly with control
and good judgment, despite the fact
| that the mechanics of aviation aren't
'.exactly a woman's forte."


LIEUT. JOHN B. PRESTON AND CHARLES DAVIS
To the parents of Stanford stu
\ dents, flying may be a dangerous and
thrilling experience, but to their sons
and daughters, doing «ide-slips or an
; eight-on-pylon is no move exciting
! than making a left turn in the fam
ily chariot or bowling along at 50
per on the Bayshore.
They learn to fly as other people
learn to drive, according to Joseph F.
Donovan, manager of the Palo Alto
School of Aviation.
Not live of the forty fledglings
who keep instructors and planes
busy are out to learn professional
aviation, a significant attitude, Dono
van believes. Most of them major in
everything but aeronautical engi
neering while in their classes. Near
ly all are out for the amateur licensc,
aviation's ordinary flying permit, and
only three hope to make money from
their experience, school records
show.
Forward-Looking Pupils
By and large, they are a forwnrd
i looking lot, Mr. Donovan has found,
1 preparing for the day when knowl
edge of aviation will be expected of
job-holders in big corporations.
"There's a real love of flying in
these fellows," he points out. "They'll
do most anything to pay for their
I course. We have them remitting by
i the lesson, week, month, and some
times paying for the entire course in
, advance out of their allowances."
As a result, Stanford students have
j the distinction of being the most air

minded group in the United States.
