# '38 Trackmen To Meet Mateo J.C. Tomorrow
## 
### 
Catching a few hours of sunshine
yesterday afternoon, Coach Bill El
lington's frosh track team had its
first chance since last Wednesday to
work out for the opening meet of
the season with San Mateo J.C. to
morrow afternoon at 3:30 o'clock on
Angell Field.
The meet was originally scheduled
for last Saturday but continual rains
made outdoor athletics impossible.
Should weather conditions take an
other unfavorable turn the meet will
be repostponed until Wednesday,
March 13.
At yesterday's loosening-up ses
sion Ellington's men, despite the
wet track and hard pits, gave a fair
showing.
Luisetti Wt^k
Hank Luisetti is still having
trouble getting into high jumping
shape after a long frosh basketball
season. His weak ankle, injured dur
ing hoop play, is still in poor condi
tion and shows signs of being unab'e
to stand the strain of the takeoff.
Luisetti's best jump this season is
5 feet 6 inches.
Jim Kneubuhl has recovered from
his touch of the flu but still is in
none too good sjiape to participate
tomorrow. Upon his shoulders rest
Stanford's hopes in sprints.
Berny Layer, frosh basketballer,
with but two weeks practice at high
hurdles this year, is making good
times and has given evidence that he
will be leading Stanford frosh con
tenders for honors at this event. Ken
Peters and Cy Oberg are running
good times at the lows.
Madlem Good
Leo Madlem has begun to dis
play good pole vaulting form, clear
ing 10 feet 6easily. Madlem, a mem
ber of El Centro's four-man track
team, will probably go twelve inches
higher than his present mark before
the season ends. 1
Sumner Gill, most consistent
vaulter on the frosh squad, is still
clearing a good 11 feet 6 inches to
stand as top man on the team in this
event.
Grant Stone and Wallace Hardin,
javelin throwers, are vieing for the
top place, both throwing in the vi
cinity of 165 to 170 feet.

There are 22,100 telephones in
India.
