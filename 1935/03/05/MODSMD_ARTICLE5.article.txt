SAN FRANCISCO, March 4 (/P)
â€”Violence marked the shutdown of
San Francisco's $5,000,000 cleaning
and dyeing industry as 1400 plants
closed their doors today in a "price
protest."
Hurling of rocks through windows
of two cleaning plants belonging to
Drake Gleaners brought arrest of
two men on charges of disturbing
the peace. They were Ted Roditsky,
21, and William O'Hara, 20.
Olga Blanton, a nurse, was cut by
flying glass as she stood inside one
store, according to police.
The men were, arrested after win
dows rif a Drake plant on O'Farrell
street were smashed as pickets pa
raded in front of the building carry
ing banners reading "Down With the
Chiselers." Earlier, windows of an
other Drake establishment on Van
Ness Avenue had been broken zy
another crowd.
The Drake concern was one of
three "independents" around whose
plants police had thrown guards.
The three, not members of the Dry
Cleaners and Dyeing Institute, which
called the shutdown, kept plants
open but did not send out trucks to
pick up clothing.
