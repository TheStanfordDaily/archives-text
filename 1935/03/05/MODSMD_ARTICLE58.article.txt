# BASEBALLERS MEET ST. MARY'S TODAY IN POSTPONED TILT
## 
### 
If the weather permits, the base
ball game with St. Mary's will be
held today at 3:15 o'clock. Rain pre
vented the game from being played
last Saturday, and rain has pre
vented the Stanford varsity from
practising for almost a week. But
despite that fact, the team is in good
shape, and Coach Harry Wolter is
looking for a fast and well-played
ball game.
The local club will have its full
strength on the diamond with co-
Captain Fred Heringer and Mike
Ferro forming the The new
infield which functioned perfectly
in yesterday's practice session, will
be Mallatratt, Woolley, Hamilton, and
Tremaine, anl in the outer garden,
Brent, Leidig, and Hohnan.
As before, players will be num
bered and announced, and in addi
tion score cards will be printed for
the spectators.
