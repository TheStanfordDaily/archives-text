# Rich and Poor Pay Tribute to Fremont Older
## 
### Robert Eisenbach 
Men and women from ell walks
of life, writers, artists, journalists,
financiers, and just bums —a cross
section of humanity—paid tribute
today to the memory of Fremont
Older, veteran newspaper editor, and
for years ranking figure in the po
litical life of the state, following his
death Sunday.
Telegrams and letters from high
| and low poured into his ranch home
' at Saratoga. Long a friend of the
j underdog, pai'ticularly those whom
| he believed to be the victims of in
justice, Older consecrated his life to
I such problems as the Mooney-Bil
i lings case, never for a moment fal
| tering in his battle to right the
! wrongs of the law.
| A heart attack ended his life at
: the age of 78 as he was driving his
; wife and a friend, Mary d'Antonio, to
j Stockton after they had attended a
I flower show in Sacramento. Older
slumped at the wheel, and a few
| minutes later was declared dead by
Stockton Deputy Coroner Emanuel
Silva.
Private funeral services, conducted
i according to his oft-repeated wishes,
I will be held today from his Sara-
I toga home, the Rev. Henry Ohloff of
San Francisco officiating.
