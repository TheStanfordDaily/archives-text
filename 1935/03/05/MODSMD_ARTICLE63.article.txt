# FARM POLO TEAM TO MEET OREGON
## 
### 
Stanford's poloists entrain Thurs
day afternoon for Corvullis where
they will engage the Oregon State
College team in a fwo-gaine series.
The contests will be played indoors
Friday and Saturday in the after
noon to avoid a conflict with the
0.5.C.-U.S.C. basketball games. ..
Weather permitting, the red-shirt
ed mallet wielders will scrimmage
Wednesday afternoon on the High
way Field. The iifdoor game played
with three men instead of four will
handicap the Indians who have had
little or 110 experience.
