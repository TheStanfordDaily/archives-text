### 
ATHENS, March s—Loyal5—Loyal soldiers
swept rebels before them over the
historic battlefields of Macedonia to
night as rumors spread lhat ex-Pre
mier Eleutherios Venizelos was mak
ing ready to quit the revolt.
To the rebels fleeing toward the
wild mountainous country npar the
Turkish and Bulgarian frontiers,
went this ultimatum, from General
George Kondylis, minister of war:
"Surrender or be crushed."
Leader Tries Flight
Rumor said Venizelos, termed ti
tular head of the revolt, had attemp
ted to leave his refuge in the island
of Crete and flee to Alexandria.
A government airplane, flying over
the rebels' headquarters in Macedo
nia as loyal troops pressed hard at
their heels, dropped General Kondy
lis' curt ultimatum to them.
Curt Ultimatum
"Surrender within 24 hours," his
message read, "or my troops will
crush you. I have sufficient forces,
but I am anxious to avoid fratricidal
war. I call on you to lay down your
arms."
General Kondylis reported the
rebels numbered between 2500 and
3000.
Heartened by reports desertions
from the insurrectionists were nu
merous, the government notified its
legations abroad it was "growing
more and more confident." '
A finish fight was expected shortly,
with the possibility the 71-year-old
Venizelos, if he is still on the island
of Crete, may be cut off from escape.
Movement Broken
Many former Venizelos supporters
in the capital swung their support
to Premier Panayoti Tsaldaris' gov
ernment, leading the administration
to believe the back of the Venizelist
movement had been broken.
Determined, however, to smash
every last vestige of revolt without
delay, the government was pressing
its advantage in Macedonia.
