## Sword and Sandals Group Will Read Comedy 
### 
] Tomorrow night at 1 o'clock Little
Theater audiences will see Sword
| and Sandals' fortieth anniversary
I presentation, the Capek brothers'
| "Insect Comedy."
Sword and Sandals, men's lion
| orary dramatic society, was first or-
I ganized in 1893. The membership
\ roll of those early days shows the
, names of two members of the pres
j ent board of trustees, Leland W.
[Cutler and W. Palmer Fuller. Wil
i liam Brownlee Owens was a mem
ber, as was Will Irwin.
In its initial stage, Sword -uid
Sandals was a strictly honorary
society, engaging in no public ac
tivities. In 1917, however, by pre
senting Shakespeare's "Two Gen
tlemen of Verona," it began a
! practice of sponsoring an annual
play, and this custom continued
until 1 !)!(>, when the war put a
, stop to all campus dramatics.
After several periods of -alter
| nating activity and decadence, the
| organization was revamped in 1919.
i From therl until 1926 it again pre
' sented annual plays. Among its
members in this period who are
now on the professional stage are
j Lloyd Nolan, William Thornton, who
! will return next summer to offer
; Shakespeare courses, and Lester
! Vail. Maxwell Anderson, fjimed
i playwright, is also a member.
Group Readings Start
It was three years ago that Val
i lejo Gantner, at that time president
of Sword and Sandals and now also
I on the professional stage, conceived
j the idea that group readings might
entertain the public. His idea was
received with enthusiasm, and a few
1 weeks later Sword and Sandals pre
sented a reading of Noel Coward's
"Private Lives." It was an irustan
i taneous success, and the readings
I have been continued ever since.
To Read Comedy
Sword and Sandals presentations
have ranged from the brilliant high
I comedy of the first production
j through every phase of the drama.
Because of the expenses incidental
to the production, an admission
| charge of ten cents will be charged
tomorrow night.

It was three years ago that Val
i lejo Gantner, at that time president
of Sword and Sandals and now also
I on the professional stage, conceived
j the idea that group readings might
entertain the public. His idea was
received with enthusiasm, and a few
1 weeks later Sword and Sandals pre
sented a reading of Noel Coward's
"Private Lives." It was an irustan
i taneous success, and the readings
I have been continued ever since.
To Read Comedy
Sword and Sandals presentations
have ranged from the brilliant high
I comedy of the first production
j through every phase of the drama.
Because of the expenses incidental
to the production, an admission
| charge of ten cents will be charged
tomorrow night.
