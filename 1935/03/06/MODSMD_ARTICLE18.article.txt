j Feeding out a steady line of in

j the founding of the school and ends

j the daily task of Warren Rockwell
i who guides tourist excursions

Two Tours Visit
At this time of year, Rockwell re
! ports, there are about 40 busses a
j month representing two special
I tours which bring sight-seers to the
I campus. In the summer time that

Rockwell works with Ed Gearhardt
who runs the picture stand.
"We -try to anticipate the tour
i ists' questions and have them an
j swered before they are asked," he
I says in revealing the technique of
Jus job. '"the idea is to fnTkHsteadily
all of the way in and out."
As the party gets organized and
starts through the Memorial Court,
lie begins by revealing the back
ground of the University: who the
were, all about their son.
win they founded the University,
I how large it is, and something of

the ideals and aspirations of the
Stanfords.
While passing under the Memor
ial Arch and up toward the Church,
he verbally constructs the church
and describes tho mosaics on the
outside. Inside he further describes
the mosaics and decorations, and
leaches the point where the church
was destroyed in the earthquake.
On, the way out he gets the church
reconstructed and tells of the present
extent of the University and some
thing of its student organization.
Typicnl Americans
The sightseers on these tours are
typical traveling Americans who
want to see jus much as possible in
the shortest time. There is usually
a middle-aged woman in the party
who has been abroad and wants
everyone TO know it. She continually
compares and contrasts the Chapel
with this or that cathedral which she
has visited. The majority of the tour
ists, Rockwell says, whether or not
they know anything of architecture,
feel that they should admire the
Chapel and comment very favorable
