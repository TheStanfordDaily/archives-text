# Kirkpatrick To Run in Benefit Meet
## Tickets On Sale Today, Students 25 Cents 
### 
While a troupe of financial mana
gers began canvassing the Farm in
a widely inclusive ticket-selling
campaign, other Skull and Snake
members were busily applying final
touches to the plot to have a "blan
ket finish in every event" at the all-
University track and field meet Sat
urday.
The meet, designed to raise funds
for Stanford's trip to the 1.C.4-A will
be held in Angell Field at 2:15
o'clock. Tariff for students will be
25 cents; outsiders will be charged
55 cents.
Kirkpatrick To Run
The latest addition to the long list
of individual duels was made prob
able by the tentative acceptance of
Roy Kirkpatrick, prep school boy
from Montezuma. Kirkpatrick, who
recently tied with Sam Klopstock in
the Jiigh hurdles* is an excellent
competitor in both barrier events,
and will give Stanford's 1.C.4-A
champion a pair of tight races.
Along with Kirkpatrick will come
Steve Taggert, Montezuma broad
jumper, accredited with a best of
23 feet 11V2 inches. Taggert will
jump against George Tharp of the
varsity and Paul Zaches, alumnus
who will enter the meet.
Alumni Rel:\y Probable
Probability of a varsity-alumni
relay as a climax to the competi
tion was seen last night. Should the
event materialize, Ben Eastman will
lead the alumni baton-passers, aided
by Les Hables, Norm Bright, and
Frank Fullenwider. Eastman is still
undetermined as to whether he will
oppose A1 Blackman in a feature 440.
Other special matches already ar
ranged include a duel between Wal
ter Marty, world's high jump record
holder, and Humbert Smith of the
Indians; a javelin contest between
Johnny Mottram of Stanford and Ed
Waterbury of the Olympic Club, and
a melee in the weights with Johnny
Lyman and Henri La√üorde, former
Cardinals, vying for first place with
Phil Levy and Bob and Jim Rey
nolds.
