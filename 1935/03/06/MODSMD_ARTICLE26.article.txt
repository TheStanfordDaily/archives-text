hundred dollars to add to its already

the Dramatic Council is struggling
under annually accumulating defi
cits because it must pay part of the
salary of the dramatics director, Stu
dent Manager Ben Cave said at Ex
Committee last night.
Cave recommended to the com
mittee IhU the quarterly salary
of $250 that the Dramatic Council
has to pay to the director should
be reduced and that a greater por
tion should be paid by the Uni
versity.
Though impressed by Cave's ar
guments, # Ex Committee deferred
action on the problem until next
meeting—after it has had a chance to
hear Dramatic Council Manager
Dick Frank on the subject.
Orchestra Bidding
Cave introduced two other mea
sures to Ex Committee. Because
Cave expressed his trouble in get
ting orchestras at prices low enough

tras.
The committee also empowered
Cave to loan the Glee Club money
at six per cent interest up to the
face value of the Club's guarantees
for its proposed spring tour.

Faced with a deficit of several
hundred dollars to add to its already
existing $1,000 debt to the A.S.S.U.,'
the Dramatic Council is struggling
under annually accumulating defi
cits because it must pay part of the
salary of the dramatics director, Stu
dent Manager Ben Cave said at Ex
Committee last night.
Cave recommended to the com
mittee IhU the quarterly salary
of $250 that the Dramatic Council
has to pay to the director should
be reduced and that a greater por
tion should be paid by the Uni
versity.
Though impressed by Cave's ar
guments, # Ex Committee deferred
action on the problem until next
meeting—after it has had a chance to
hear Dramatic Council Manager
Dick Frank on the subject.
Orchestra Bidding
Cave introduced two other mea
sures to Ex Committee. Because
Cave expressed his trouble in get
ting orchestras at prices low enough
for jolly-ups, Ex Committee author
ized him to declare open bidding
for contracts with jolly-up orches
tras.
The committee also empowered
Cave to loan the Glee Club money
at six per cent interest up to the
face value of the Club's guarantees
for its proposed spring tour.
