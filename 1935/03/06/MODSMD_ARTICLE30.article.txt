.lames Corbett, member of Unit bungling
Board ol Kqualizalion which is making at
tempts to settle this Menlo Park li<| nor dis
pute, hit the front pages yesterday with his
<pierv, "Isn't it a fact that a har is maintained
on the Stanford campus?
Sneh a question from a "kid" brother ol a
toil,nil might he excusable, but not from a
member of a board which has supposedly
been dealing with the time-worn controversy
which the t niversity lias been waging for
years now.
The fashion in which that unit has handled
the situation might explain such an asinine
question. At the first of the year the Board
issued IT Menlo liquor permits ,alter the
Supreme Court had handed down a decision
lasl i/i'tir against such action within the mile
\and a-half limit of the campus. Then a few
days later Frank Keesling, attorney for the
Board, stated that that body acknowledged
ihal the licenses had been issued bv mistake
and would be cancelled. In a two-hour session
al Sacramento yesterday the noble Board, al- j
ways decisive in its actions, postponed cancel
lation of the licenses.
The Board, muddle-headed as usual, blun
ders along. It is hard to conceive how a body
like that, if it tended to its duties, could,
unknowingly, issue permits to sell liquor after
the Supreme Court Lias ruled against such
action in the inile-and-a-half /one and after
the t niversity administration has been hound- j
in 14 that Board and Menlo Park for the en
forcement of the ruling. Perhaps the members
were 100 busy, looking in the papers for ar
ticles about themselves, to read about a Su
preme Court ruling concerning their .juris
diction.
Corbelt should become better informed
about his position and its problems under con- ;
sideration. After all, the Board should know a
little about the local liquor situation.
We beg to inform him that there is no bar on
the Stanford campus.
