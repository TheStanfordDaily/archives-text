# Bagatelle: Its Value
## 
### 
The quarter h;is just about reached Hint
point where the usual Irilk's have magnified
themselves td ;m alarming proportion. On tin*
t nion lius t'nMen the hoary eurse of "under
nourishment vs. overcharging"; on the droop
ing shoulders of the bookstore is pinioned the
accusation of "monopoly."
Meanwhile an anonymous student writes
in to remark that since Stanford is not in
cluded in somebody's list of the "first ten
colleges," perhaps the professors on the cam
pus might he ranked, that since independent
study is called by that name, why not make it
iindependent ?
Social regulation talk gluts the campus air.
and while one faction claims that the phrase
merely means ;i uniform understanding of
existing rules, a group goes ahead to agree that
campus police at every dance to report "con
duet unbecoming" is the logical step to end
eamptis violations. Meanwhile the city press
eagerly seizes upon such a vibrant topic, and
the Kami's individual problem must be aired
before a jawing populace.
Meanwhile just a cursory examination of all
these momentous problems brings to light the
fact that all the charges may not be worth
the volubility their authors expend upon them,
when I hey are aired out a bit.
So far as exorbitant prices in the I nion
cellar are concerned, inquiry brings to light
that at certain hours during the day there are
"specials' 'at the counter, served as cheaply as
any eating place or restaurant of the same
caliber could offer.
The bookstore "monopoly" falls rather Hat
as soon as the important factor is discovered
that it is not making enough money to pay
dividends on purchases at the end of the year,
and the common understanding is that a mo
nopoly which fails to make money cannot
properly be termed a very harmful monopoly,
The question of the I nivcrsilx not standing
among the lirsl ten in the list of "best" col
leges, while the I'nivci sitV of C.alifornia ranks
in fifth spot, might be solved by hiring a Stan
lord alumnus to make out a rating ail of bis
own. I ndoiibtedly the I arm could thus secure
the desired recognition.
And so all the licrx arguments break down
to some extent under a scrutinizing eye, while
only the indisputable facts that the Lake has
risen three feet by virtue of spring rains, that
the May Held road is about to receive repair
work, and thai final examinations appear
ominously close at hand, remain to remind us
I hat t here is work to be done.
