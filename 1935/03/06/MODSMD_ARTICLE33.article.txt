IL DUCE IN PANDORA'S BOX—HOWELL
"Mussolini Over Abyssinia" might well be the title
of the chapter of history now being written by II Duce
in the land of the swarthy Ethiope.
Mars has evidently decided that peace has raged
too long in the Near East, that troubled region once
called by Prince von Bulow the Pandora box of Europe,
lor in addition to the present Greek civil war, the
impending Italo-Ethiopian fracas seems liable to break
momentarily.
Editor Chester Howell of the S-«n Francisco
Chronicle, political science lecturer at Stanford in
international relations, points out some of the sali
ent facts concerning the Fascist leader's aspira
tions on the ancient realm of Abyssinian Emperor
Ilaile Selassie (who claims descent from King
Solomon by the Queen of Sheha), and rider of
some 10.1100,000 Ethiopes, most of whom are adher
ents of the Christian faith.
During the nineteenth century Europe gobbled up
Africa territorially so rapidly that the dark continent
by 1900 was more or less a tail to the European kite,
that is, with the exception of one country—Abyssinia.
Although the Italians had attempted to conquer the
Ethiopians in 1896, they were disastrously defeated at
Adowa.
Imperialist Ambitions
Imperialist ambitions were once more roused in the
Italian breast with the coming of Fascism, and Africa
was the natural region in which to expend. On a Jan
uary day in 1935 a border skirmish took place between
Italian colonial troops in Somaliland and the soldiers
of the Ethiopian emperor, with most of the fighting 011
Abyssinian soil.
Envoys of Haile Selassie protested to the League of
Nations, of which Ethiopia is a member, but the league
found convenient business elsewhere, and fearing to
offend Mussolini, sought to have the disputants settle
the quarrel among themselves. On February 10 another
clash occurred and more Ethiopians and Italian troop
ers were killed. Mussolini's patience was exhausted. He
summoned some 30.000 Fascist troops for the "African
front" and began shipping accoutrements of warfare
and supplies to Italian Somaliland. II Duce no doubt
dreams of uniting Italian Eritrea on the Red Sea with
the long coast of Italian Somaliland on the Indian
Ocean at the expense of Ethiopia.
"The Italo-Abyssinian incident seems to me
another in the series of defiances of the League of
Nations," states Editor Howell. "It is similar to the
Greco-Italian border dispute of 1923, wherein Mus
solini bombarded Corfu and refused to allow the
matter to be settled by the league, but referred it
to a Conference of Ambassadors.
"We have had a similar sequence of defiances of
league authority in the cases of Germany, J" ( pan,
Paraguay, and other nations. Mussolini now insists
the Italo-Abyssinian dispute does not come within
the jurisdiction of the league's authority, and be
cause the national honor of Italy is involved, will
not back down from this stand. '
The editor points out thaf there may well be an
understanding between European powers, giving Mus
solini a chance to penetrate the rich country of Em
peror Haile Selassie in exchange for other considera
tions due to a "community of interest - ' of the former
allied nations.
With Italian support of Austrian independence,
France will prob'ably give her southern neighbor free
rein in subduing Ethiopia. French and British Somali
land would doubtless benefit territorially if Abyssinia
Were conquered and partitioned.
Europe looks with longing eyes at Ethiopia. It has
a pleasant climate, with fertile soil and an abundance
of rainfall. Minerals such as coal, sulphur, ertpper,
platinum and gold exist plentifully. Its chief crops
are rubber, coffee, fine wood, grain and cotton. Cattle
and sheep-raising also flourish.
It is little wonder, the editor concludes, that Musso
lini should feel covetous of this territorial prize of
Ethiopia.

During the nineteenth century Europe gobbled up
Africa territorially so rapidly that the dark continent
by 1900 was more or less a tail to the European kite,
that is, with the exception of one country—Abyssinia.
Although the Italians had attempted to conquer the
Ethiopians in 1896, they were disastrously defeated at
Adowa.
Imperialist Ambitions
Imperialist ambitions were once more roused in the
Italian breast with the coming of Fascism, and Africa
was the natural region in which to expend. On a Jan
uary day in 1935 a border skirmish took place between
Italian colonial troops in Somaliland and the soldiers
of the Ethiopian emperor, with most of the fighting 011
Abyssinian soil.
Envoys of Haile Selassie protested to the League of
Nations, of which Ethiopia is a member, but the league
found convenient business elsewhere, and fearing to
offend Mussolini, sought to have the disputants settle
the quarrel among themselves. On February 10 another
clash occurred and more Ethiopians and Italian troop
ers were killed. Mussolini's patience was exhausted. He
summoned some 30.000 Fascist troops for the "African
front" and began shipping accoutrements of warfare
and supplies to Italian Somaliland. II Duce no doubt
dreams of uniting Italian Eritrea on the Red Sea with
the long coast of Italian Somaliland on the Indian
Ocean at the expense of Ethiopia.
"The Italo-Abyssinian incident seems to me
another in the series of defiances of the League of
Nations," states Editor Howell. "It is similar to the
Greco-Italian border dispute of 1923, wherein Mus
solini bombarded Corfu and refused to allow the
matter to be settled by the league, but referred it
to a Conference of Ambassadors.
"We have had a similar sequence of defiances of
league authority in the cases of Germany, J" ( pan,
Paraguay, and other nations. Mussolini now insists
the Italo-Abyssinian dispute does not come within
the jurisdiction of the league's authority, and be
cause the national honor of Italy is involved, will
not back down from this stand. '
The editor points out thaf there may well be an
understanding between European powers, giving Mus
solini a chance to penetrate the rich country of Em
peror Haile Selassie in exchange for other considera
tions due to a "community of interest - ' of the former
allied nations.
With Italian support of Austrian independence,
France will prob'ably give her southern neighbor free
rein in subduing Ethiopia. French and British Somali
land would doubtless benefit territorially if Abyssinia
Were conquered and partitioned.
Europe looks with longing eyes at Ethiopia. It has
a pleasant climate, with fertile soil and an abundance
of rainfall. Minerals such as coal, sulphur, ertpper,
platinum and gold exist plentifully. Its chief crops
are rubber, coffee, fine wood, grain and cotton. Cattle
and sheep-raising also flourish.
It is little wonder, the editor concludes, that Musso
lini should feel covetous of this territorial prize of
Ethiopia.
