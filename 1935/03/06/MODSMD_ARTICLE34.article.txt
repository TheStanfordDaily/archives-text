Rudy Vallee, may hi.s tripe surcease,
Awake one night from a deep dream of peace,
And irl the moonlight flooding through his room
Lighting up his nose like Four Roses' bloom,
He saw an angel writing in a book of gold.
(Exceeding peace had made sweet Rudy bold)
And smirking smirks he quoth: "It's a!! right, my man,
II you want my autograph, but, dearie me, don'i
hog the spotlight.
Upon the presentation of the vital evidence below
Our Hasher proves his claim that Comptroller Almon
E. Roth is a superior entrepreneur.
It seems that at the May fie Id flicker house last week
the management was holding a "vegetable night.
Everybody who held a ticket had a chance to win one
of several large boxes of groceries. Well, with the spin
of the wheel of fate, it chanced that Roth's number
was called.
Our dignified keeper of the fiscal accounts walked
up on the stage, and like a homing pigeon, headed uner
ringly to his mark. Casting glances to neither right nor
left at the paltry boxes of vegetables', he seized the
most valuable box of all—a collection of canned goods
—and made ofT with it.
The Kappa Sigs have boycotted Our Hasher since
we announced their proclivities to eyestrain. They deny
the charge absolutely, irrevocably, and undeniably, and
add. with remorse, that the K.K.G. blinds have been
hastily snatched down every night since our little
notice.
