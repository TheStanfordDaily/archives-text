# BULL SESSION
## PIECE OF PEACE

| Whether it was "Depression"' or a
Stanford predilection for peace, th<
| Military Ball was nul the booming
success th«t field artillery men would
I like to have seen it. Not having been
"here" (on the campus), nor "there"
i (at the Ball), we yet suspect the
dance suffered from depression or
managerial mishap. For few if any
j on the campus take the Military Ball
J as an expression of militarism.
In fact, as a group, the men of

children—raised on fife, drum, and
gun—rush cheerfully off to conduct
peace negotiations on the Abyssin

tions of the world disport them
selves—signing a treaty here, break
ing one there, filling in the intervals
calling each other vipers.
In April, university students all
over America will express their dis
j approval of war. A peace assembly
! will probably be held on the Stan
: ford campus. Here, at the home of

Stanford, and peace (but probably
