CHANCES OF A
NEW EE AGUE

About the new hoop league •which
local sport sheets have been bally
hooing this winter, Stanford's grad
uate manager and basketball coach, j
A1 Masters and John Bunn, and
California's corresponding officials, ;
Bill Monahan and Nibs Price, met
over a San Francisco lunch table
last week. The result was a defining
of the pro and con for the league, j
which would be composed of the i
present Card, Trojans, Bears, Bruins
combination plus St. Mary's, Santa
Clara, and S.F.U.
On the pro side: It would ob
viously strengthen interest in Cali
fornia basketball. As it is now,
California, U.S.C., U.C.L.A., and
Stanford have to play each other
four times to have a season cf
any length at all. But if one temm
easily outclasses the others in the j
opening games, as the Trojans did
this year, fans lose interest be- I
cause they feel the outcome is I
certain.
Now basketball is a game of up- !
sets. There were upsets this year,
as when Stanford and U.C.L.A. de- i
feated Cal. But the more teams there j
are the more upsets are likely and j
the more interest is created. Prob
ably the most successful league in .
the country, from the enthusiasm
standpoint, is the Rocky Mountain j
League. It has 10 teams.

DIFFICULTIES IN
SCHEDULE MAKING

On the con side: An almost in
surmountable number of problems
involving schedule making and con
ference set-up would have to be
worked out. With St. Mary's, Santa |
Clara, and S.F.U. joining, there
would be five teams in the north (
against two in the ;>outh. Hence, i
each team playing the other three i
times, U.S.C. and U.C.L.A. would
ask that the other teams always play ;
two games on their home courts in
order to prevent an impossible num
ber of trips north. But playing in the
home gym is considered a distinct
advantage, and whether the north
ern schools would be willing to give i
away that much every year is doubt
ful.
Other difficulties involve the con- j
ference of which Stanford, Southern i
California, U.C.L.A., and California I
are now a part. The winner of the i
present southern conference plays j
the winner of the northern confer- I
ence, composed of Oregon and Wash- j
ington schools. Washington, Oregon,
and the others do not recognize
Santa Clara, St. Mary's, and San
Francisco University at the present
time.

NO ACTION
UNTIL JUNE

Obviously the difficulties on this
score are considerable. Breaking
away from the northern • conference
and doing away with the now anti
climatical play-off is the only solu
tion that appears at the present time.
That would lead to complications in
other sports, such as football.
Thus St. Mary's, Santa Clara, and
S.F.U. cannot merely be voted into
the? league, as some of the metro
politan sport writers would have us
believe. Radical changes in our pres
ent set-up would have to come first,
and it is highly improbable that they
can be made within the year. No of
ficial action will be even started until
the conference meeting in June.

this year, fans lose interest be- I
cause they feel the outcome is I

Now basketball is a game of up- !
sets. There were upsets this year,
as when Stanford and U.C.L.A. de- i
feated Cal. But the more teams there j
are the more upsets are likely and j
the more interest is created. Prob
ably the most successful league in .
the country, from the enthusiasm
standpoint, is the Rocky Mountain j
League. It has 10 teams.

DIFFICULTIES IN
SCHEDULE MAKING

On the con side: An almost in
surmountable number of problems
involving schedule making and con
ference set-up would have to be
worked out. With St. Mary's, Santa |
Clara, and S.F.U. joining, there
would be five teams in the north (
against two in the ;>outh. Hence, i
each team playing the other three i
times, U.S.C. and U.C.L.A. would
ask that the other teams always play ;
two games on their home courts in
order to prevent an impossible num
ber of trips north. But playing in the
home gym is considered a distinct
advantage, and whether the north
ern schools would be willing to give i
away that much every year is doubt
ful.
Other difficulties involve the con- j
ference of which Stanford, Southern i
California, U.C.L.A., and California I
are now a part. The winner of the i
present southern conference plays j
the winner of the northern confer- I
ence, composed of Oregon and Wash- j
ington schools. Washington, Oregon,
and the others do not recognize
Santa Clara, St. Mary's, and San
Francisco University at the present
time.

NO ACTION
UNTIL JUNE

Obviously the difficulties on this
score are considerable. Breaking
away from the northern • conference
and doing away with the now anti
climatical play-off is the only solu
tion that appears at the present time.
That would lead to complications in
other sports, such as football.
Thus St. Mary's, Santa Clara, and
S.F.U. cannot merely be voted into
the? league, as some of the metro
politan sport writers would have us
believe. Radical changes in our pres
ent set-up would have to come first,
and it is highly improbable that they
can be made within the year. No of
ficial action will be even started until
the conference meeting in June.
CHANCES OF A
NEW EE AGUE

About the new hoop league •which
local sport sheets have been bally
hooing this winter, Stanford's grad
uate manager and basketball coach, j
A1 Masters and John Bunn, and
California's corresponding officials, ;
Bill Monahan and Nibs Price, met
over a San Francisco lunch table
last week. The result was a defining
of the pro and con for the league, j
which would be composed of the i
present Card, Trojans, Bears, Bruins
combination plus St. Mary's, Santa
Clara, and S.F.U.
On the pro side: It would ob
viously strengthen interest in Cali
fornia basketball. As it is now,
California, U.S.C., U.C.L.A., and
Stanford have to play each other
four times to have a season cf
any length at all. But if one temm
