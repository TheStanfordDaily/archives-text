# PADDLERS PUT ON FIGHTING FINISH
## 
### 
At the slim Card victory in the
big meet swimming last week in
Berkeley, Stanford stuck by tradi
tion and upset the dope because Nort
Thornton had a bunch of come
through paddlers . . . John Harvey
in the breaststroke and Bub Hoover
and Don Peterson in the long free
styles way outdid themselves . . .
Peterson wasn't even figured on for a
place in the 440 . . . his best previ
ously was 5:25 ... at the end of five
minutes of swimming there wasn t
half a body length between him, Jack
Dozier of Cal, <md Bill Clemo of the
Cards . . . It took the judges five min
utes to decide the blanket finish . . .
Pete won in 5:18.8, Clemo second,
Dozier (winner last year) third . . .
Milt Friedman beat: teammate Chuck
Boothe for the first time this year
to take second in the diving . . .
also a comer-through . . . didn't do
anything last year until the Cal
meet, and he won it then . . . Bobby
Foster, Card captain, recently de
feated a member of the U.S. swim
ming team in the 1932 Olympics
when he won from Paulsen of the
Trojans in the 200-yard breaststroke
. . . then Saturday frosh Walter
Teasdale of the Blue and Gold bet
tered Foster's record by nearly a
second and a half . . . about the time
the diving was concluded, things be
gan to look black for the Cards . . .
somebody alongside mentioned
something about the "Stanford

: swimming machine cracking" . . .
but the Indian swimmers knew what
it would take . . . Hoover and Pet
erson both did better than ever be
i fore to take second and third in the
220-yard free style . . . Foster equated
the coast record for 100 yards of
breaststroke to provide the winning
margin in the medley relay . . .
Nort was so weak when it was all
1 over he could only whisper . . .
and the Cards won on squad
strength, not stars' . . . which is
something for a school used to seven
i men track teams. D'Evelyn.
