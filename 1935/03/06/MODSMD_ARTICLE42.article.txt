# Harry Maloney Makes Card Trophies Live in Retrospect
## Patriarch of Coaching Staff Speaks of Years When Games Were Games 
### Robert Eisenbach 
"Remembering? — It's the best
thing I do," smiles Coach Harry Ma
loney. He's been at Stanford for 27
years as athletic conditioner and di
rector of minor sports, and though
he now ranks as patriarch of the ath
letic coaching staff, he's still spry and
sandy-haired.
Trophies Inspiration
His memory spans the years be
yond the good old days. He can "re
member when" on the field or in
his office, but he's best when sur
rounded by the 80-odd trophies in
Stanford's trophy room in the Men's
Gym.
To the uninitiated, the collection
may look like a columbarium of ath
letic triumphs, but to Harry, every
cup, every faded picture that lines
the walls carries with it a living
memory.
His prize is the old red banner,
now tattered and torn by Father
Time, presented by Mrs. Leland
Stanford in 1892, first tangible me
mento given to Card athletes.
First Block "S"
Another of his favorites is the
first Block "S" sweater. It's faded
now, and the red "S" is a pale pink
that an athlete would consider in
sulting, but Harry remembers that
sweater in pristine giory, when it
was the property of W. L. McLaine,
captain of the 1896 baseball team.
The trophy room is Harry's avo
cation. When he's not busy directing
minor sports he makes studies of old
football programs, for instance, in
cluding the one laboriously explain
ing that Stanford will play its fil"st
intersectional football game with
Chicago on Christmas Day, 1894.
Tickets were only fifty cents, we
understand, and Southern Pacific
ran a special $1.00 round trip to the
city.
Big Game* Are Tame
Harry hasn't always been in a
sweatshirt showing the boys how. He
changed from classed to muscle-pro
fessoring in 1910, and until about
1925 was athletic conditioner for
Stanford teams.
"Big games have changed like
everything else," he sighs. "They're
nothing like the "mud-game" in
1910, when Stanford held Cal to a
3-3 tie in the pouring rain at the old
U.C. track field." Harry remembers
that day as his high-spot in black
bag toting. "The ground was like
liquid molasses," he remembers,

I stood on the sidelines in case
of injuries. My big job wasn't ban-
Idaging, though; it was retrieving the
j ball from mud puddles to save the
! boys an extra wetting."

Living Caption
I He's a living legend-line for every
jone of the fifty team-pictures that
| line the trophy room walls. Some
; where in the third row of a stiffly
posed group is a manager named
; Herb Hoover, Harry discovered.
! There's another of the 1899 crew,
and down in front is Jim Reynolds,
; captain. He is now manager of the
j Southern California Automobile As-
I sociation, and the father of Jim Rey
nolds, Jr., '37, the shot-putter. In the
! first varsity soccer team coached by
: Maloney in 1910 is a young Chinese
j lad, a fellow named William Pung,
j Class of 1912. He was just .ii strug
gling engineering major then, and
a middling ball-kicker. Now he's
j China's greatest engineer and a gov
! ernment big-shot.
Harry has big memories and little
i ones, you .see. But the size of the tro

phies commemorating them hasn't
anything to do with length and di
mensions of his reminiscences.
Wants New Room
He's that kind of a fellow. He likes
to draw something big out of some
thing little, either in thought or ath
letics. He also likes to talk about
his memories, but the only trouble
is that not very many people can
come round to listen, the trophy
room being where it is.
He suggests it be moved from its
present location by the men's show
ers to, say, the library, where wom
en as well as men can browse
around. "We have one of the best
collections in the world," says Harry.
"Let's put it where people can see
it—and hear of it."

letic triumphs, but to Harry, every
cup, every faded picture that lines
the walls carries with it a living
memory.
His prize is the old red banner,
now tattered and torn by Father
Time, presented by Mrs. Leland
Stanford in 1892, first tangible me
mento given to Card athletes.
First Block "S"
Another of his favorites is the
first Block "S" sweater. It's faded
now, and the red "S" is a pale pink
that an athlete would consider in
sulting, but Harry remembers that
sweater in pristine giory, when it
was the property of W. L. McLaine,
captain of the 1896 baseball team.
The trophy room is Harry's avo
cation. When he's not busy directing
minor sports he makes studies of old
football programs, for instance, in
cluding the one laboriously explain
ing that Stanford will play its fil"st
intersectional football game with
Chicago on Christmas Day, 1894.
Tickets were only fifty cents, we
understand, and Southern Pacific
ran a special $1.00 round trip to the
city.
Big Game* Are Tame
Harry hasn't always been in a
sweatshirt showing the boys how. He
changed from classed to muscle-pro
fessoring in 1910, and until about
1925 was athletic conditioner for
Stanford teams.
"Big games have changed like
everything else," he sighs. "They're
nothing like the "mud-game" in
1910, when Stanford held Cal to a
3-3 tie in the pouring rain at the old
U.C. track field." Harry remembers
that day as his high-spot in black
bag toting. "The ground was like
liquid molasses," he remembers,

I stood on the sidelines in case
of injuries. My big job wasn't ban-
Idaging, though; it was retrieving the
j ball from mud puddles to save the
! boys an extra wetting."

j Class of 1912. He was just .ii strug

Harry has big memories and little
i ones, you .see. But the size of the tro

phies commemorating them hasn't
anything to do with length and di
mensions of his reminiscences.
Wants New Room
He's that kind of a fellow. He likes
to draw something big out of some
thing little, either in thought or ath
letics. He also likes to talk about
his memories, but the only trouble
is that not very many people can
come round to listen, the trophy
room being where it is.
He suggests it be moved from its
present location by the men's show
ers to, say, the library, where wom
en as well as men can browse
around. "We have one of the best
collections in the world," says Harry.
"Let's put it where people can see
it—and hear of it."
"Remembering? — It's the best
thing I do," smiles Coach Harry Ma
loney. He's been at Stanford for 27
years as athletic conditioner and di
rector of minor sports, and though
he now ranks as patriarch of the ath
letic coaching staff, he's still spry and
sandy-haired.
Trophies Inspiration
His memory spans the years be
yond the good old days. He can "re

rounded by the 80-odd trophies in

cation. When he's not busy directing
minor sports he makes studies of old
football programs, for instance, in
cluding the one laboriously explain
ing that Stanford will play its fil"st
intersectional football game with
Chicago on Christmas Day, 1894.
Tickets were only fifty cents, we
understand, and Southern Pacific
ran a special $1.00 round trip to the
city.
Big Game* Are Tame
Harry hasn't always been in a
sweatshirt showing the boys how. He
changed from classed to muscle-pro
fessoring in 1910, and until about
1925 was athletic conditioner for
Stanford teams.
"Big games have changed like
everything else," he sighs. "They're
nothing like the "mud-game" in
1910, when Stanford held Cal to a
3-3 tie in the pouring rain at the old
U.C. track field." Harry remembers
that day as his high-spot in black
bag toting. "The ground was like
liquid molasses," he remembers,

I stood on the sidelines in case
of injuries. My big job wasn't ban-
Idaging, though; it was retrieving the
j ball from mud puddles to save the
! boys an extra wetting."

Living Caption
I He's a living legend-line for every
jone of the fifty team-pictures that
| line the trophy room walls. Some
; where in the third row of a stiffly
posed group is a manager named
; Herb Hoover, Harry discovered.
! There's another of the 1899 crew,
and down in front is Jim Reynolds,
; captain. He is now manager of the
j Southern California Automobile As-
I sociation, and the father of Jim Rey
nolds, Jr., '37, the shot-putter. In the
! first varsity soccer team coached by
: Maloney in 1910 is a young Chinese
j lad, a fellow named William Pung,
j Class of 1912. He was just .ii strug
gling engineering major then, and
a middling ball-kicker. Now he's
j China's greatest engineer and a gov
! ernment big-shot.
Harry has big memories and little
i ones, you .see. But the size of the tro

phies commemorating them hasn't
anything to do with length and di
mensions of his reminiscences.
Wants New Room
He's that kind of a fellow. He likes
to draw something big out of some
thing little, either in thought or ath
letics. He also likes to talk about
his memories, but the only trouble
is that not very many people can
come round to listen, the trophy
room being where it is.
He suggests it be moved from its
present location by the men's show
ers to, say, the library, where wom
en as well as men can browse
around. "We have one of the best
collections in the world," says Harry.
"Let's put it where people can see
it—and hear of it."
