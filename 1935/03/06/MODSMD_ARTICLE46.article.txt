# March Turns In Good Time for 880-Yd. Run
## 
### 
Rusty March added another fast
half mile to his season marks in yes
i terday's varsity track workout on the
! Angell Field oval with a time of 1
| minute 58.7 seconds, good time for
i the cold weather and for the chop
: ped-up condition of the track.
Turning out for the first time yes
! terday was Ken Nobs, second string
j center of the Indian quintet for the
| season just closed and a high jumper
j of frosh and varsity experience. As
[ soon as his legs get into shape, Nobs
j should be jumping 6 feet or better
| regularly, and will be a valuable ad
j dition to the Humbert Smith-Lloyd
1 Schween combination that has been
; doing the high jumping for the var
| sity this spring.
