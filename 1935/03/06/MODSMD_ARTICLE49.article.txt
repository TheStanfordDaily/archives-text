# STANFORD NINE LOSES 4-3 TILT TO ST. MARY'S
## Gaels Gain Early Lead In Contest; Cards Fail To Close Gap 
### 
The Card varsity's old habit of
staking its opponent to a substantial
lead in the opening innings again
lost a game, this time to St. Mary's
nine yesterday, 4-3.
In the last six innings the Indians |
played air-tight ball, and almost |
overcame the Gaels' four-run lead i
by scoring three runs on clean ,
singles. Despite the unfortunate sec- |
and and third frames, when the visi- ,
tors were given four runs on only j
four hits, it was a general feeling in '
the bleachers that the Cards turned j
in their best performance of the i
year.
Brent. Hamilton Star
•A! Brent and "Bones" Hamilton led j
the Card batting attack with two j
hits apiece, while Gordy Mallatratt
and Mike Ferro each collected a
bingle. Fred Heringer went the i
whole way on the mound, alfowing j
seven hits, six of them in the first l
four innings.
Defensively the Indians appeared i
immensely improved, with Tremaine j
and Mallatratt turning in perfect |
records in the infield.
The small crowd which braved an I
early-inning drizzle was rewarded j
with plenty of excitement in the final
inning. In the eighth Stanford
scored two runs when Brent hit
safely, and Mallatratt and Holman
walked, filling the bags.
Scores on Error
Hamilton was safe and one run
scored on an error. Woolley's infield
out brought another run home. With :
the count now 4-3, and with the pos- ,
sibility of an Indian victory on base, j
Stealy, the Saint flinger, tightened I
up and retired the side.

The Card varsity's old habit of
staking its opponent to a substantial
lead in the opening innings again
lost a game, this time to St. Mary's
nine yesterday, 4-3.
In the last six innings the Indians |
played air-tight ball, and almost |
overcame the Gaels' four-run lead i
by scoring three runs on clean ,
singles. Despite the unfortunate sec- |
and and third frames, when the visi- ,
tors were given four runs on only j
four hits, it was a general feeling in '
the bleachers that the Cards turned j
in their best performance of the i
year.
Brent. Hamilton Star
•A! Brent and "Bones" Hamilton led j
the Card batting attack with two j
hits apiece, while Gordy Mallatratt
and Mike Ferro each collected a
bingle. Fred Heringer went the i
whole way on the mound, alfowing j
seven hits, six of them in the first l
four innings.
Defensively the Indians appeared i
immensely improved, with Tremaine j
and Mallatratt turning in perfect |
records in the infield.
The small crowd which braved an I
early-inning drizzle was rewarded j
with plenty of excitement in the final
inning. In the eighth Stanford
scored two runs when Brent hit
safely, and Mallatratt and Holman
walked, filling the bags.
