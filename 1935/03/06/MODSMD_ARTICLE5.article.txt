BERLIN, March s—Reichsfuhrer5 —Reichsfuhrer
. Hitler today sensationally canceled
| plans for a proposed conference with
Sir John Simon, British foreign.sec-'
! rctary, attributing his act to a head
|cold.
However, diplomatic circles said,
' they believed he was angered by an
i official British criticism of German
j rearmament and that they felt a
I rift had been produced which might
j prove irreparable in present inter-
I national negotiations.
1 Hitler's precipitate action split
i German public opinion sharply into
! two sections.
One section charged der Fuehrer,
j in suddenly postponing his confer
| ence with Sir John Simon, British
J foreign secretary, set for Thursday,
may have lost an historic opportun
j ity for insuring world cooperation.
The other section, which included
Hitler's most ardent adherents, took
the view the new Germany, as per- v
sonified in Hitler, once again showed
the world that it won't stand for any
belittling.
Hitler and Simon were expected to
discuss every phase of the Anglo
j French proposals,'drafted at London
j early in February, which included
j an air defense alliance for Western
| Europe.
