# Child Pianist Shows Dextrous Technique
## Rendition Shows Unusual Maturity in Style 
### Barbara Sweet 
Revealing an unbelievable dexter
ity and poise, Ruth Slenczynski, ten
year-old pianist, played last night
before a large and enthusiastic au
dience in the Pavilion.
Her program, given entirely from
memory, offered her excellent op
portunity to display her well-devel
oped technique.
Chopin Well Played
Perhaps the most impressive of
her numbers was Chopin sonata, Op.
35 B Flat Minor, in which she dem
onstrated feeling and maturity of
understanding which supplemented
the technical skill necessary to exe
cute this difficult work, a maturity of
understanding lacking in her open
ing presentation, Bach's Preludio E
Major.
Of the three encores permitted by
her father—-she would give as many
as the audience desired if she were
allowed—the last, Liszt's Campanel
la, was most enthusiastically re
ceived.
Likes Stanford
Asked by the interviewer if she
enjoyed playing at Stanford, Ruth
replied smilingly, "Why, of course.
Yes." "Would you like to play here
again?" "Oh, you bet. It's a hard
thing, but I can never come back."
Ruth said that she would like to
attend Stanford as a pupil and ex
pressed a wish to return to Califor
nia to live someday. (She now has
her residence in Paris). Her father
is her teacher, and when asked which
instructor she has enjoyed working
under most, she replied, "Daddy. He
has been my only teacher."
