# FOUNDER'S DAY CONCERT SUNDAY
## Traditional Date, Senator Stanford's Birthday 
### 
The Founders' Day concert to be
given in the Memorial Chapel Sun
day evening by the Stanford Sym
phony Orchestra and the Stanford
Women's Choral will be the 44th
celebration in the history of the Uni
versity.
The first Founders' Day was held
on May 14, in 1891, the anniversary
of the birth of Leland Stanford Jr.
On that occasion the faculty and
student body entrained for Mon
terey and held the program there.
The following year the commem
oration was at the Big Trees, Santa
Cruz.
After the death of Senator Stan
ford in 189.'} the date of the ob
servance was changed to March 1),
the senator's birthday. This Ins
been the traditional date of each
Founders' Day since, but this year
the date has been changed to
March 10 so that the program will
come on Sunday.
In 1894, Former President Benja
min Harrison made the Founders'
Day address. The program has va
ried from time to time, but it has
usually taken the form of a musi
cal concert. In 1922, in addition to
the concert, Dr. Jordaft laid the cor
nerstone of the Stanford Union. In
1923 the program was broadcast over
a 400-meter wave-length radio con
structed by the Department of Elec
trical Engineering.
The only year since 1893 in which
Senator Stanford's birthday has not
been observed was in 1905 when the
date preceded Mrs. Stanford's death
by nine days, and musical services
were held in commemoration of both.
