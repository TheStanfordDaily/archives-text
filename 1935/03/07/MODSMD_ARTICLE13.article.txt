# TICKET DRIVE PROCEEDS FOR BENEFIT MEET
## Hables Will Try Comeback; Eastman, Lyman To Be Featured in Events 
### 
i "A feature in every event," is the
way George Edmonds, head of the
Skull and Snakes committee for the
I all-University benefit track meet
Saturday, summarizes advance plans
for the meet, while assistants in the
various living groups are driving for
j the 2000 paid-admissions goal.
And somehow, the typical ballyhoo
of that statement stands a deal of
testing. Even though a potential
blanket-finish is not promised in
every department, Edmonds can
think up some reason why the event
v/ill bear watching.
Specialty Numbers
By events, the specialty numbers
I are:
Sprints—Can Abe Hables come
i back? Among those saying not are
| Chuck Voigt, Ray Dean, and Jim
Kneubuhl. The "hard luck kid," now
an alumnus, will be here to prove
the point.
440—A1 Blackman, 1.C.4-A winner,
running for time with A1 Cranston,
Truck Dellinger, and Lloyd Davis.
Still a very strong possibility, Ben
Eastman will run against Blackman
with something under 48 flat devel
| oping, conditions satisfactory.
Ben Eastman Runs
880—Ben Eastman against the best
j of the present flock, including Chuck
j Nirrtmo, Joe Burris, and Bill Soren
json; Eastman still claims all records
I at the distance, but Nimmo, in bet
ter condition, will give the Blazer
an uncomfortable afternoon.
Distances—Norm Bright upholding
: alumni against Rusty March, Nimmo,
I Burris, and Warren Dixon of the
j varsity.
Hurdles To Be Close
Hurdles—Sammy Klopstock, N.C.
| A.A. and 1.C.4-A winner, bent on
I avenging a deadlock with Roy Kirk
! Patrick, prep school youth from
; Montezuma, and Blackman injecting
i himself into the general fuss that will
I be the low hurdle race.
| High jump-i-World's record hold-
J er, Walter Marty, against potential
I record man of the future, Humbert
: Smith of the Indian varsity. It's
I scheduled for an exhibition for
j Maity, but Smith may win if the
j Fresno flash is out of commission.
| Marty likes the pit at Angell Field,
I and will go over most people's heads.
Taggcrt Is Favorite
i Broad jump—George Tharp of the
varsity, Paul Zaches, alumnus, and
Steve Taggert, prep teammate of
Kirkpatrick, all with ideas. Taggei't
| rules favorite.
Pole vault—No competition; just
I Arne Anderson after a week of prac
j tice seeing if he can be counted on
j for points against California and
! Troy; he may do anything or noth
| ing.
Lyman In Form
Shot and discus—Here Laßorde of
j the alumni strangely underdog to
: Phil Levy, 160-footer, with Johnny
Lyman and Jack King getting into
: the discus fuss. Lyman will enter
tain with some freak weights in the
shbtput; he's in good shape and may
! get a few more odd-size world's
j records.
Javelin —Just a pair of 220-foot
j men—Johnny Mottram of Stanford
and Ed Waterbury of the Olympic
i Club.
j Advance ticket sales end 2 o'clock
j Friday; tax on students is 25 cents,
I and 55 cents for outsiders.
