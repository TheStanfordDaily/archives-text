# Henry Cowell, Famous Pianist, Teaches Rhythm
## 
### MARTHA SPRAGUE 
Composer, pianist, lecturer, writ
er, inventor. Such are the accomp
lishments which can be placed after
the name of Henry Cowell, who is
this quarter teaching a rhythm class
under the women's physical educa
tion department.
Percussion instruments from many
parts of the world, including Cuba,
Africa, Syria, Hawaii, Alaska, and
the Orient are used by the present
rhythm class which is studying both
the theory and practice of rhythm.
Studied Abroad
During 1931-1932 Cowell traveled
through Europe on a Guggenheim
Fellowship and studied primitive
rhythms. His phonograph recordings
of the most characteristic ones num
ber nearly 2000 and represent the
music of many strange peoples.
among them the Balinese, Polyne
sian, Javanese, and Turkish.
Modernism is the keynote of Cow
ell's achievements. The Cleveland
Plain Dealer has hailed him as "the
most persuasive of all the heralds of
the new era in music." He has dis
covered a new and unsuspected use

of the piano in that it can be made
to give forth the greatest variety of
percussion sounds of any instrument.
In experiments Cowell has found
that there are 140 classes of sounds
that can be produced on the piano,
proving that it has more different
tone qualities than all the other per
cussion instruments in an orchestra
put together.
Invents Rhythmicon
An accomplished pianist and
speaker, Cowell has made many con
cert and lecture tours all over the
world. He has composed 700 compo
sitions for piano, voice, violin, and
small and large orchestras. A few
use percussion features and some
bring out new advances in rhythm
and harmony. Many of his articles on
music have been printed in maga
zines and encyclopediae.
Perhaps Cowell's most unique
achievement is his invention of a
musical instrument which he calls
ihe rhythmicon. This invention calls
for the use of the whole arm and
thus carries man's ability to produce
music beyond the old limit of a piano
composition for two hands.
