# FREEDOM TO BE TOPIC TONIGHT
## 
### 
Tonight the question of "Academic
Freedom and Hearst" will be dis
cussed at the meeting of the Walrus
Club at 7:30 o'clock in room 520 in
the geology corner.
Preliminary talks will be given on
the subject by Lieutenant-Com
mander Stewart F. Bryant and Dr.
Harold Hand of the education de
partment. These speakers will dis
cuss the question from the angles of
suppressed-speech activities in the
eastern colleges and in California.
While attending an educational
meeting in ihe East, Dr. Hand inter
viewed professors in eastern schools
and gained their opinions on speech
suppression in class lectures. Lt.-
Com. Bryant has recently returned
from a tour of California where he
observed and contacted activities in
this state which resulted in speech
suppression. The discussion is par
ticularly timely at this time as there
are now several bills before the
State Legislature which deal with
this problem.
Elizabeth De Vinny will be chair
man of the discussion section that
will follow the introductory ad
dresses.
