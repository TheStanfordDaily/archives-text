# S.F. Fair Heads To Give Final Decision Monday
## 
### 
Members of the board of directors
for the proposed 1938 World Fair to
commemorate completion of the
Golden Gate and San Francisco-
Oakland Bay Bridges, will present
its final decision regarding the ex
position site to the San Francisco
Board of Supervisors Monday, it was
learned today.
Indications are that they will hold
to their former choice of the Yerba
Buena shoals as the only financially
expedient site. No money will be
asked from the city to help defray
expenses if the shoals arc agreed
upon, it was pointed out.
