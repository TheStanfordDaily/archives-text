### 
ATHENS, March 6 (A 3 )â€” Bloody
hand-to-hand fighting in the streets
of ancicnt Kavalla tonight followed
an attack by 20 government bombing
planes which sowed death and de
struction in the ranks of Macedonian
rebels.
After raking Kavaila with ma
chine guns and raining bombs upon
it, the bombers roared away to strafe
the insurgents' encampment near
Seres, from which government ar
tillery blasted them earlier today.
Citizens Battle
A five-hour battle, the outcome of
which was not disclosed in semi
official messages reaching the capi
| tal from the front, followed ihe aerial
j raid on the old Aegean seaport as
: residents, described as supporters of
the government, rose against the rev
olutionaries who had invaded it.
So hard pressed by the govern
j ment's land and air forces was Gen
j cral Demetrios Cammenos, the rebel
j commander, that ho wirelessed an
I appeal to the rebel ship Psara to put
iin at Kavalla and help quell the
j enraged citizens, the message said.
Rebels Pressed
A Greek fleet cleared the Straits
j of Euboda enroute to Crete to try to
engage the insurrectionists' five
j ships. One of them, the cruiser Aver
! off, has been reported missing from
i its harbor at Crete.
As the aerial marksmen, zooming
I down as low as sixty feet, rained
j bombs upon the rebels' barracks and
j swept their camps with machine gun
fire, three Greek divisions, pressing
in at the enemy from as many sides,
chafed at bad weather which im
peded their advance.
Giving most emphatic assurance
that the victory "of the lawful gov
ernment is fully assured," the pre
mier paid tribute to the Greek public
for its loyal stand against "the abom
l inable enemies of their peace."
