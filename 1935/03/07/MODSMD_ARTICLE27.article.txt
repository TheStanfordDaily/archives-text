# Women's Council Barks Up the Wrong Tree

### 
The Women's Council 11y it 11 arbitrary judg
nienl yesterday slapped a heavy penally upon
two campus women who were guillv of an
an(omohile olTense.
There was no doubt that there was an in
fraction ol good taste, and that the two
women were guilty. Still the line was of such
a character as to make this decision ol the
council seem far out of proportion to the
incident itself.
Two weeks ago the violators entered the
quadrangle of the t'niversity and proceeded
to drive around within the quad itself. Thev
had the unhappy fate of being caught by a
watchman, while in the process of exploring
the initer quad roads.
When this case came before the Women's
Council yesterday afternoon, that august body
decided to make an example of the all'air, and
assessed the two women with a twenty-live
dollar line, as well as taking away their driv
ing privileges on the campus for the remain
der of llu' year.
Student a Hairs which are controlled by
student government must be very carefully
handled. There is the all-too-easv tendency
to become autocratic iu judgment and pass
rules, or inflict lines thai are out of proportion
to the offense committed. Had Women's
Council acted wisely, thev would have in-
Hieled a warning penalty and a stern rebuke
to the women. The effect would have been
the same.
Jin! by their high-handed action, the council
has only succeeded in arousing resentment at
their excessive line, and it is doubtful whether
any beneficial results which they doubtless
had in mind will lie attained. In the first
place, although good taste should have been
sufficient to restrain them, there are no signs
which tell that the motorist is forbidden from
the quadrangle, and the two violators only
proved once more that the feminine curiosity
is ;m overpowering motive.
Two things are certain. First, the Women's
Council should reconsider the penally in
llicted, which takes away driving privileges
for foil" months; secondly, an attempt to
make an example by drastic action loses its
elVecl when ii reaches a point that is oppres
sive.
