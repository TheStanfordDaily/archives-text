colleges. (>ll the Eastern seaboard where the
nation's more radical students hold forth,
academic freedom has not ihe standing which

around his neck when he was held responsible
for an article which appeared in his news
paper.
In California an intense interest surrounds
I lie current criminal syndicalism trials now
in progress in Sacramento. Being so close to

relevant to the topic. An interesting evening
of discussion seems assured.
