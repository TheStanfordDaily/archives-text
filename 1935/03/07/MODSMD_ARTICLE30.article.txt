SAN FRANCISCO OF TOMORROW—MEARS
A glimpse of the San Francisco of tomorrow is
afforded by a survey of Dr. Eliot G. Mears, professor
of international trade in the Graduate School of
Business.
"1 envision a San Francisco of the future which may
well be the capital of the western world in the Pacific
basin, if cities of the Bay region will only work in
harmony," declares Dr. Mears. "While New York is
holding .sway with the great European capitals in the
westward march of history, San Francisco is rapidly
coming into her unquestioned destiny as the occidental
metropolis of the Pacific world, but does not yet have
all the importance it should have."
San Francisco is the outlet of a vast and rich hinter
land, and the natural commercial port of entry for other
nations of the Pacific to America. The peninsular city
has unlimited possibilities for growth of trade and
expansion to a mercantile center of the first magnitude.
It must foster greater unity with the other Bay cities
in an intelligent plan lor orderly development in the
future.
San Franciscans must be at special pains to stimu
late good will of the British Empire, Latin America, and
the Asiatic nations, as indeed they are doing in such
steps as advertising methods, expositions and other
means.
The Bay cities must put bickering behind and
concentrate on a common future harmonious
growth. He stresses four cardinal needs of the Bay
are?: a regional zoning, a unified port authority and
harbor plan, more rapid modes of transit, and de
velopment of park and recreation sites.
Professor Mears finds that the population movement
in United States during the past generation has been
largely to the "deep-water rim of the country," that is,
to the Atlantic and Pacific seaboard (in which San
Francisco has shared), the Gulf of Mexico and the
Great Lakes. Heretofore San Francisco has derived its
population elements chiefly from foreign immigration
and from rural America. With immigration shut off,
it is now becoming an adult population of white-collar
classes, with decreasing numbers of children annually.
Between IH2O and 1930 the number of persons
engaged in trade in San Francisco increased from
1!) per ccnt to 21 per cent, and in the same period
the Goldan Gate city's bank deposits jumped 150
per cent while those of New York declined S per
cent.
"San Francisco Bay is the best harbor on the
Pacific Coast, and one of the finest in the world,"
states Professor Mears. "Since the opening of the
P vnama Canal in August, 1914. the old isolation of
the American Pacific Coast is gone, and California
has been brought much closer to Europe.
"Population on the Pacific Coast has grown more
rapidly in recent years than in any part of the
United States, and San Francisco has gained great
numbers of inhabitants. California had an increase of
some 2,401,288 persons in the decade ending 19.'50. and
manufacturing and industrial development has kept
pace with this general expansion.
With ihe completion of the Golden Gate and San
Francisco Bay bridges, the cities of the bay will have
new links binding them more closely, and civic leaders
should constantly emphasize the need for closer coop
eration on the part of each political unit.
San Francisco is rapidly on the way to becoming the
Pacific entrepot of western commerce, the professor
concludes, but must never neglect the axiom of reach
ing hands across the bay and working for common
progress with her neighboring cities. Then will the
lines written to San Francisco by Bret Harte be
fulfilled;
Serene, indifferent of Fate,
Thou sittest at the Western Gate;
Upon thy height, so lately won,
Still slant the banners of the sun;
Thou seest the white seas strike their tents,
O Warder of two continents!
And, scornful of the peace thai flies
Thy angry winds and sullen skies,
Thou drawest all things, small or great,
To thee, beside the Western Gate.

Professor Mears finds that the population movement
in United States during the past generation has been
largely to the "deep-water rim of the country," that is,
to the Atlantic and Pacific seaboard (in which San
Francisco has shared), the Gulf of Mexico and the
Great Lakes. Heretofore San Francisco has derived its
population elements chiefly from foreign immigration
and from rural America. With immigration shut off,
it is now becoming an adult population of white-collar
classes, with decreasing numbers of children annually.
Between IH2O and 1930 the number of persons
engaged in trade in San Francisco increased from
1!) per ccnt to 21 per cent, and in the same period
the Goldan Gate city's bank deposits jumped 150
per cent while those of New York declined S per
cent.
"San Francisco Bay is the best harbor on the
Pacific Coast, and one of the finest in the world,"
states Professor Mears. "Since the opening of the
P vnama Canal in August, 1914. the old isolation of
the American Pacific Coast is gone, and California
has been brought much closer to Europe.
"Population on the Pacific Coast has grown more
rapidly in recent years than in any part of the
United States, and San Francisco has gained great
numbers of inhabitants. California had an increase of
some 2,401,288 persons in the decade ending 19.'50. and
manufacturing and industrial development has kept
pace with this general expansion.
With ihe completion of the Golden Gate and San
Francisco Bay bridges, the cities of the bay will have
new links binding them more closely, and civic leaders
should constantly emphasize the need for closer coop
eration on the part of each political unit.
San Francisco is rapidly on the way to becoming the
Pacific entrepot of western commerce, the professor
concludes, but must never neglect the axiom of reach
ing hands across the bay and working for common
progress with her neighboring cities. Then will the
lines written to San Francisco by Bret Harte be
fulfilled;
Serene, indifferent of Fate,
Thou sittest at the Western Gate;
Upon thy height, so lately won,
Still slant the banners of the sun;
Thou seest the white seas strike their tents,
O Warder of two continents!
And, scornful of the peace thai flies
Thy angry winds and sullen skies,
Thou drawest all things, small or great,
To thee, beside the Western Gate.
SAN FRANCISCO OF TOMORROW—MEARS
A glimpse of the San Francisco of tomorrow is
afforded by a survey of Dr. Eliot G. Mears, professor
of international trade in the Graduate School of
Business.
"1 envision a San Francisco of the future which may
well be the capital of the western world in the Pacific
basin, if cities of the Bay region will only work in
harmony," declares Dr. Mears. "While New York is
holding .sway with the great European capitals in the
westward march of history, San Francisco is rapidly
coming into her unquestioned destiny as the occidental
metropolis of the Pacific world, but does not yet have
all the importance it should have."
San Francisco is the outlet of a vast and rich hinter
land, and the natural commercial port of entry for other
nations of the Pacific to America. The peninsular city
has unlimited possibilities for growth of trade and
expansion to a mercantile center of the first magnitude.
It must foster greater unity with the other Bay cities
in an intelligent plan lor orderly development in the
future.
San Franciscans must be at special pains to stimu
late good will of the British Empire, Latin America, and
the Asiatic nations, as indeed they are doing in such
steps as advertising methods, expositions and other
means.
The Bay cities must put bickering behind and
concentrate on a common future harmonious
growth. He stresses four cardinal needs of the Bay
are?: a regional zoning, a unified port authority and
harbor plan, more rapid modes of transit, and de
velopment of park and recreation sites.
