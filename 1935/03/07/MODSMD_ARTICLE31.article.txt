# OUR HASHER SEZ:
## 
### 
Our Hasher is quite burdened down with apple
burnishing the.se days, not that he does it himself, but
that the girls are having an epidemic of faculty dinners
since finals are coming on and all. Our Hasher has
tossed many a bowl of soup into a faculty lap, and he
sharply warns the girls that what has happened before
can happen again.
I don't know why I should castigate the sororities
on this subject, though. The Phi Delts really hold the
all-time record in ki«sing the apple. Last night they
had twenty (20) faculty members partaking of Harry's
cooking. If the Phi Delts invited all the gi'ads of "Phi
De'ta Theta for aye" they would have considerably
more than that. But the gratis won't come. They know
what it is to get lost in the Phi Delt house and get
taken for a pledge.
The Phi Dclts were plenty mad about Our Hasher's
statement on the Alpha Dclts flying kites. They claim
brother Grayson (who lives in Mayfield) is the inno
vatoi of kite-flying at Stanford, and that he has flown
kiles so high that he has signed up some prospective
track athletes from Mars, or maybe it was Glendale.
Which statement reminds us of the story going the
rounds about a certain sorority. It seems that Dean
Mary Yost was breaking bread with the girls one night.
After the meal was over, the little party adjourned to
the'front room, while the hashers could clear the
table and say their bad thoughts about the lateness of
the hour. One of the gentlemen who regularly hangs
in and around the house came out in the kitchen to
wait until the affair was over. But a telephone call
came for him. Not knowing what to do, the girls sug
gested he take the call on the second floor. So our hero
walked calmly up the back stairs to speak through
the phone, which was at the head of the front stairs.
But there, standing at the bottom of the- steps, was
Dean Mary Yost. Nobody said a word.
Yesterday's high wind sent a tin smoke stuck
crashing through a skylight in the Deegee house, but
despite the pand» moniuni, the girls remained perfectly
calm. The\ thought it was only an Alpha Delt hasher
dropping a tray.
There are reports that the Thetas are ealovis of th?
Alpha Phi ventilator, and have so jimmied the kitchen
door that it will not close and .iume of the favored lew
can listen to all the profanity in the luteinn dining
