### 
TAXATION OR \ IVISECTION?
j The state legislature, led by the
| great governor of Long Beach, Cal.,
I (U.S.A.) Is enteving upon the most
j important work of its session. It is
j considering the tax progrum whose
revenues will run the slate, or run
\it ragged, during the next couple
I years.
Governor Merriam, you will re
call. was elected in the "ied"-sling
ing campaign of last November, on
j the issue that he would make Cali- '
! forma safe for Americanism. I
: "AMERICANISM,' as not defined by j
j the American Legion, means govern
i merit "of the people, by the people,
' and for the people.' Governor Mer
riam will be closely watched in the
i next few days to see whether or not
I he stands by the Lincoln version of
Americanism, or rather supporis the
revised text —calling for government
j "of the interests, by the interests,
and for the interests."
Already, the campaign to "soak the
poor" and "pamper the rich" has
| begun. Reminiscent of last Novem
! ber, one newspaper calls upon "the
j whole sober thought of California"
i to reject any sort of a "radical tax
j program." The stigma of "radicalism"
| is fastened onto the inheritance tax
I and the income tax. And the ill—
'smelling sales tax is flooded in the
; perfume of reactionary praise.
The income tax is very neatly dis
posed of: either it must be so high,
j says the "newspaper," that it will
! drive industry out of the state; or
! else it must be so low as to make its
I revenues insignificant. The same ar
j gument could be applied equally
\ well to the American practice of
< drinking water: either you drink
so much that you become water
; logged, or else you drink so little
' that the benefit derived is not worth
! the energy spent in the act of
! drinking.
I
The inheritance tax is smashed
j with the same £ort of easy grace,
j Nothing is as unfair as direct quo
tation, hence we quote directly:
j "They would boost the inheritance
| tax, to discourage any man of means
i from living long enough in California
to risk dying here." In other words,
jif the inheritance tax is raised, no
lone will want to die in California.
■ But to the doddering lich, we doubt
! that California sunshine will seem
j the more lethal when "death taxes"
| are increased. To anyone who gen
. uinely wants to live, the health-giv
ing properties of certified California
climate is worth the thousands of
dollars taxed away after mortis
has set in.
To the "newspaper" in question,
' and to numerous others, one of the
easiest ways out of our difficulties is

to increase the sales tax. It is ap
parently better to cut in heavily on
the poor man's bread and milk than
i to disturb the large fortunes of the
living or the dead. But far more hor
rible than the fantastic thought of
driving industry out of the state
should be the thought of driving the
"little man" below the subsistence
level, or onto the governmental re
lief rolls.
If Governor Merriam was really
talking "Americanism" last Novem
ber, and not just "Merrianism," he
will shape his tax program to bring
relief, and not misery to the people
I of California.
