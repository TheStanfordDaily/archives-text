At tlie Fox Stanford
Warner Brothers' adaptation of
Somerset Maugham's story, "The

Sacred Flame,
leaves much to
be desired. Jo
sephine Hutch
inson, who has
the feminine
lead, is an inept
actress and not
very good look-

ing. Colin Clive was rather good as
her invalid husband. The scenes
where his nerves get the better of
him and he breaks down were done
especially well. George Brent, as
dive's brother, had only a small and
comparatively unimportant role. Di
rection, casting, acting — all could
have been much better. The picture
is interesting only for what it might
have been.
