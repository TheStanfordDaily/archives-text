THE HOOP SEASON—
STATISTICALLY

In three long pages of statistics,
compilations, and charts, Don Lieb
endorfer, director of Stanford News
Service, reveals some interesting
facts on ihe conference basketball
season just closed. From the Stanford
viewpoint, perhaps the most start
ling, and at the same time comfort
ing, figures show that in the two
iour-game series the Trojans scored
52 more points than did California,
and only 33 more points than did
Stanford. Hence the Cards, in play
ing the Trojans, are 19 points better
than the Eears. But in <he four Cal-
Stanford tilts, the Cards made 23
points less than the Bears.
Also, the statistical extent of
Troy's hoop greatness . . . they
averaged exactly 45 points per
g'vme and whipped their opponents
by seven field goals . . . they
scored 50 points or more in four
games and over 40 in eight . . .
two of their men, center Guttero
and forward llupp, together scored
from 17 to 40 points per game, and
averaged 27.
On the much discussed roughness
of the different teams . . . Cal had
177 fouls charged against her during
the conference season . . . the Cards
followed with 160, then U.S.C. with
156, the Bruins with 137 . . . Stan
lord led in the gift shots with 208,
and was last in the number made,
95 . . . averaging 46 per cent, against
U.S.C.'s 55 per cent, California's 57
per cent, U.C.LA.'s 59 per cent . . .
Jack Kopke of California was the
champ free throw sinker, 29 for 46
. . . and the Bcfars also had the champ
foul committer, Bob Herwig, who
was called 39 times by the referees,
and in half of the games was ejected
for four personals.

IMPROVEMENT FOR
ANGELL FIELD

CAL'S NEW
ELECTRIC CLOCK

Hurray! At last the Angell Field is
benefiting by long-needed repairs.
Beside the brick field house is a
little shrubby acacia tree now bril
liant with golden blossoms. Support
ing the heavily-laden branches were
i'our-by-four piles, painted an un
obtrusive dark green color. But the
finished lumber disturbed the fitness
of things, and the four-by-fours are
now being replaced by unfinished
redwood poles, which not only are
still covered with bark but have
little green shoots, adding a rustic
note.
Angell Field might benefit by
other improvements. For example,
something might be done about the
track, one of the more important
elements. A couple of distance run
ners taking a midweek workout
following anything more than a
shower cut up the surface until
an outsider mi rht think that he
was viewing the route of the 147 th
artillery.

Well, anyway, California has an
electric clock, anyway, the kind this
column advocaled for the Stanford
oval. The Associated Oil Company
had one temporarily installed for the
U.C. meet last Saturday. It worked
without a hitch and added a lot of
enjoyment for the fans who under
stood times.
A1 Masters, Stanford graduate
manager, says Stanford probably
won't get one because it can't be
protected on Angell Field and there
will be only one meet in the sta
dium. Cal has six dual meets sched
uled for Edwards Field, besides the
N.C.2A, and private backers feel
that their investment will receive
plenty of use, while Stanford's slim
home schedule wouldn't justify it.
