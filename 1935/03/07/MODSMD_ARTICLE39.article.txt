### 
| Providing the rain has stopped by j
noon today, the Stanford varsity net- j
j men will combat California's net
j team at 1:30 o'clock on the varsity
courts. Favox-ed to win by one or
two matches, Stanford's tournament
today will probably be another laurel
for the Card team.

Jack Lynch, Ben Dey, and Bob
Pommer will each play a singles
I match for Stanford. The first doubles j
i team will be composed of Seward I
| and Dey; the second, Lee and Pom- j
mer; and the third, Law and Lynch, j
Match Advanced
The match was originally .slated |
for Saturday, but because of pro- J
; tests from California, it was moved j
up to today.
The Card team, its rank filled with j
nationally ranked stars, has had a ;
successful season so far in its prae- j
! tice games. Last Saturday they van- I
.quished the California Tennis Club!
! and the week previous defeated the j
Golden Gate Tennis Club, a strong '
| team.
Championship Material
Sam Lee, number 1 man on the
, tennis ladder, was national inter-
I collegiate doubles champion. Dey,

i the national junior doubles cham
pionship, while Jack Lynch also has
: been national junior doubles cham
