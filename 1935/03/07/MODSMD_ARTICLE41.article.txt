# Masters Denies Rumors Of Big Ten Track Meet
## 
### 
J
| The publicity given by a San
Francisco newspaper Saturday to a
proposed track meet between Stan
j ford and one of the Big Ten schools
the week preceding the N.C.2A meet
in Berkeley is without justification,
according to word received from A1
! Masters, Stanford,graduate manager.
The Indian trackstcrs have an
open date that Saturday, but no team
has been approached to fill it, and a
meet between Stanford and Michi
gan, Ohio, or lowa State is no more
than a slight possibility.
