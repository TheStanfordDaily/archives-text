# INDIAN TRACK SQUAD APPROACHES FULL STRENGTH; INJURIES GREATLY REDUCED
## 
### MORT D'EVELYN 
Despite rainy, cold weather and a
muddy, slow track, Coach Dink
Templeton's 1935 track squad has
approached full strength in numbers
during the past two weeks.
The close of basketball season has
found Arne Anderson, pole vaulter,
and Ken Nobs, high jumper, report
ing for the first time. For the pres
ent at least, the injured list is greatly
reduced, with George Tharp, broad
jumper, completely recovered from a
recent leg injury. With sunny weath
er, the shin splints and pulled mus
cles which have been bothering
sprinter Fred Williams and Joe Bur
ris and Truck Dellinger, middle dis
tance runners, should rapidly clear
up.

Also during the past two weeks the
individual-event strength of the
' coming Indian cinder squad has
been roughly determined, particu
: larly in the distance runs. At the
i present time and unless injuries
threaten strengths in other events,
the Stanford two-mile entrants .will
include Rusty March, Dave Devlin,
Bob Alexander, and Bill McCurdy.
! In the mile will be Warren Dixon,
! Chuck Nimmo, and Ed Wa'ssen. Joe
| Burris, Bill Sorensen, and Lloyd
! Davis will be the Card entrants in
| the half-mile. Entrants in other
j events are not even worth hazarding
' a guess at for the present, but should
j be largely determined by the time
I the spring quarter opens.
