## POLOISTS LEAVE FOR O.S.C. GAME 
### 
Stanford's polo team will leave this
afternoon for Corvallis where they
will meet the Oregon State Beavers
in a two-game series, the first inter
collegiate contests this quarter for
the Cards.
Game Indoors
The games will be played indoors
with three men instead of the four
used in the outdoor version. The
Indians have had little experience in
this style of play, according to Lieu
tenant H. Y. Grubbs, and the Beav
ers, though handicapped by the loss
of Hal Pangle, may give the Red
shirts more than they can handle.
Lieutenant Grubbs will take four
men, BiJl Enemark, Bill Rogers, Bob
Fullerton, and Jim Henderson. The
first three will form the starting line
up with Henderson as alternate.
Last year Stanford won both games
handily. Of the team that played in
those games, only Rogers and Ful
lerton are now playing, Luppen and
Rassmussen now being out of school.
O.S.C. Has Advantage
The greatest advantage possessed
, by the northern outfit will be their
mounts, The Beavers will ride their
own ponies, while the Indians must
play on foreign mounts, perhaps in
ferior to the ones they have been
used to.
Inclement weather put a stop to
the intended scrimmage scheduled
for yesterday, so that the Indians
will enter the contests after a week
on the ground. Certainly this lack of
work will help to equalize what su
periority the Cards may possess.
This annual engagement between
the two schools will be the last for
: two local stars. Bill Rogers and Bill
Enemark are both seniors and will
have their last crack at the Beavers
1 in this series. Jim Henderson is also
i a fourth year man.
