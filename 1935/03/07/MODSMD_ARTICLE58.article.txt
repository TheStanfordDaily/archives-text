liREAD WINS OVER MEAT
The Editor, Sir:
I thought that this would be a
good time to get rid of a gripe that
I have had for the last few weeks.
Of course, freshmen kick every
year about the food served at En
cina, and I suppose that it gets
pretty tiresome listening to them.
However, an incident which occurred
at dinner on Sunday may be of some
interest. We were all in various
stages of trying to cut and chew
some so-called class *'A" meat when
a hungry dog walked into the din
! ing hall. The head-waiter immedi
; ately tried to coax the dog out by
i offering it a generous piece of the
above-mentioned meat, but the dog
wouldn't eat it! Instead it accepted a
piece of bread which a fellow offered
it and ate that. Now I ask you, is it
j light to be offering us meat that a
j hungry dog will not eat when we are
; paying such high board bills? This
was not the first time that we have
had meat of this type served to us
cither, and it probably won't be the
last time. I think that I am speaking
for a large number of freshmen
, when I ask if something can't be
done about it.
Sincerely,
Don Dewar.
