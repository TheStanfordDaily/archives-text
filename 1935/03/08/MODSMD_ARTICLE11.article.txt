## 
### 
A1 Rushton, whote orchestra has
been the bright light, of many cam
pus dances, will sail March 20 on
the Malolo for a twelve weeks' en
gagement at the Alexander Young
Hotel in Honolulu.
Rushton, now under the auspices
of the Music Corporation of America,
has been playing an engagement at
one of San Francisco's largest hotels,
which he made into a successful
dancing spot by reason of his good
music. His broadcasts from there
every week-end were picked up in
Honolulu, and a contract for a three
months' engagement, sent by cable,
was the result.
