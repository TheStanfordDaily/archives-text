# Track Meet Is Cancelled Due to Rain
## Events Will Be Held In Spring Quarter 
### 
The 1.C.4-A.-benefit track meet,
slated for tomorrow, was postponed
last night on account of rain.
Skull and Snakes, men's honorary j
athletic fraternity, represented by
George Edmonds and his committee, |
made the dccree after continuing
rain had rendered the Angel! Fieid j
oval unfit for any manner of action.
An inch of mud covered the track
yesterday afternoon, and runaways 1
were equally skicldy.
Definite word was given, how
ever, that the meet will be held j
early next quarter, probably in
the second week of April. Tick
ets purchased this week in the
campus drive will be good at that ;
time, so there will be no necessity !
of a rain check or refund campaign, j
The committee decided that it
would not be fair lo athletes com- ,
peting, for cold weather and soft,
skittish footing is not conducive to j
record performances.
Walter Marty, for instance, was
set to try for a new outdoor record
in the high jump tomorrow. lie
would have had a hard time mak
ing the first height, for varsity
jumpers gave up the ghost when
they saw the take-oh' yesterday.
In the races also it would have
been impossible to turn in any good I
marks, even with men like Eastman, i
Blackman, Bright, and Nimmo run- |
ning. The hurdles would have been
encroaching upon suicide.
Skull and Snakes, who were in i
charge of the meet, and trying to !
raise money to send the team east i
to the 1.C.4-A., plans to re-invite all
of the athletes who had accepted for
tomorrow and others who may be
able to appear in April.
