# Bryant Mays Propaganda
## 
### 
Stressing the belief that misinfor
mation and propaganda transmitted
by uninformed or biased sources
were the chief opposing factors to
truth in public opinion, Lieut.-Com.
Stewart F. Bryant led the Walrus
Club discussion in Room 320 last
night.
Dr. Harold Hand, who was to be
the second speaker at the club forum,
was unable to appear.
Lieut.-Com. Bryant, however, ad
vanced the view that thorough edu
cation, the organization of informed
groups, and the selection of only the
most unbiased and dependable pe
riodicals would increase fact and se
curity in public opinion. He pointed
to the often inaccurate or biased
press as a great malin flu once in the
nation's thought, asserting that "it
builds fear, hate, suspicion, distrust,
and nationalism, and capitalizes on
it," thus preventing civilized co-op
eration in combating a public prob
lem.
