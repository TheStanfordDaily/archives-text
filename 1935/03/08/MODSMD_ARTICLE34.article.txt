# Finals and the Honor Code
## 
### 
With spring. Caster, and the sun-tan season
in the oiling, the old bogey of finals reappears
on the otherwise calm campus scene. March
lit is the scheduled come-back. Resides the
attending evils of cramming and jilteryness,
the presence ol the end-of-the-quarter mon
ster warns ol the existence of the Honor Code,
the accepted tradition which controls the tak
ing of examinations.
During the coining period, Ihe entire stu
dent body is extended the code privileges, with
their accompanying freedom of supervision,
and code restrictions, with their reliance on
individual honesty. The entire Kami, down
to the last man, is subjected to them.
There are written pledges in the Reg
istrar's oflice which vouch for Ihe intended
integrity of the Stanford rough as to his re
lations with rulings. A careful scrutiny, there
tore, during the tour-day period, should re
sult in a clean record for Hie campus.
