### 
Willi today's issue, lho Stanford Daily
<t;isi's activity until I ho beginning of next
quarter.
I hero are problems belore the campus
which require thought and some eonsidera
ti«»n. I or the next two weeks they will re
ceive small attention in relation to the imme
diate concern ol end-quarter studying.
However, when the spring quarter com
mences, these same topics will begin again
where they wore, left oIT, ami some thought
upon them may lead to speedy and intelligent

solutions.
I he now Stanford theatre plans must lie
! considered more seriously than ever before,
i and linal changes and suggestions made he
tort' actual construction begins. Any student
body money that is surplus may very well be
turned over toward the building of the new
edifice.
Problems of the existing system of the
honoi 1 code on the .campus will undoubtedly
be aired again during the next quarter, since
there seem to be some doubts as to its eflieaev.
On the subject of social regulations, it will
be up to the individual men on the campus
to acquaint their row and hall representatives
as to whether they think that more uniformity
in llii' social rules is necessary, or whether
i they teel that merely a clarification and
more stringent observance of r.visliny rules
is needed.
During this quarter the old and worn-out
complaint of smoking on the Quad definitely
l<MTk a turn loi the worse. Whether traditions
ol litis type are to be respected or whether new
concepts and disregard of the old are to take
their place hangs in the balance.
Meanwhile the Daily scribes lake nuieh
j needed time out in an endeavor to make up
lor lost studv time.
