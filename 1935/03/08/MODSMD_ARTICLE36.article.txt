I FRATERNITIES?
Are fraternities and sororities fading out of the'
college picture?
"Yes, says President Dennett of Williams College
and President MacCracken of Vassal - .
No, argue Dean Boucher of Chicago University,
President Woolley of Smith, and observers at Cornell,
Michigan, and Wisconsin.
Meanwhile, fraternity and sorority chapters every
where fight for their existence. Many see the hand
writing on the wallâ€”mortgages, house levies, and in
creasing competition from the new student living halls,
as organized at Harvard and Yale, which add social
aspects to dormitory living.
The situation resolves itself into a question: Is the
success of Greek letter societies based on ritual, tra
dition. close companionship? Or is it merely the result
of a need for homey places to eat and sleep?
And even if ceremonial had a strangle hold 011
college students, what guarantee have fraternity
and sorority members that these socialized dormi
tories will not in time develop their own traditions
and rites, and in so doing force the houses to the
wall by offering in addition low rents and freedom
from assessment?
In some cases, notably at Williams College last fall,
university President Dennett actually warned freshmen
not to rtish thoughtlessly into fraternities, which might
be "an anachronism in the future." The fact that t>y.7
pei cent of the frosh were pledged the following day
might be attributed more to the fact that the frats
offered the only suitable housing conditions, than e
genuine love of fraternity tile, his report indicated.
What is the answer? House presidents and
alumni must face a new situation with constructive
ideas or brook disaster. They must he willing to
change their system, to compete with the strange
new octopus of socialized, traditionalized dorms,
which threaten their single distinctive attraction.
\\ hat has made this change? It's old man depres
sion's work. The fact that fraternities and sororities
arc hard pressed for money is only one part of the
story. The other part is the part that counts. Bad
times have changed collegiate attitudes from Ihe devil
may-care play-boy outlook to one of seriousness and
judgment. College men and women are weighing val
ues, and they find them wanting in the social life of
the "house."
The place for that kind of education, they arc
coming to believe, isn't in the ordinary dorm or
the ordinary house. It's in a living hall where
dining, gaming, dancing, studying have removed
the icy hoarding house chill. It's the place where
lots of differe do lots of different things,
and work out their soil'd and intellectual salvation
in the fire of gregarious living.
"The fate of fraternities is largely in their own
hands," declares President Ruthven of the University
ol Michigan. "II they will abandon some of their exclu
sive features and become more democratic, if they
will encourage a greater degree of self-discipline and a
larger sense of social responsibility among their mem
bers, and if the chapters will frankly recognize that
the trend of the times is toward greater efficiency in
education, they can survive successfully. The frater
nity can easily avoid extermination by changing their
policies and practices so as to make of themselves Ihe
educational units they should be."
