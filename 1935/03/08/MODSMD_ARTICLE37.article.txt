There is a certain sponsor with a profile in Encina
who is known as the scourge of "Mellinkoff's Fire
Trap. He is reputed to be the biggest menace to
Stanford's traditions of free speech, free water, hot air,
and clean lecture rooms, since Wallace and Lauridsen
used to pound the corridors.
Many have been the legends that have grown up
around this mythical figure. (It is expected that in
future years fathers will quiet their children with the
statement: will get you if you don't watch out.")
One time, the Encina furnace was reputed to be
full of brc >wn dressing gowns when it was rumored
that this mighty man was looking for a gentleman in
such an outfit, who doused him with water.
Another time, was so determined to get his
man that he even ran the risk of bodily harm to track
down his quarry. It seems that a certain wise-guy was
inflicting harm on the wavy glass that passes for win
dows in the barn with a BB gun. One day when the
cannonade of shots was particularly dense and all ef
forts to locate the culprit, the Great Avenger walked
directly out in the Bull Pen.
The wise-guy took one look at the keeper of the
peace and let go a volley to the seat'of the pants. It
was doubtless a great source of satisfaction to the Un
known Soldier, but it cost him 24 hours in the Convales
cent Home.
The Great Avenger also presides with great dignity
at the breakfast table. .Many are the Tuesday night lec
tures on Science and Philosophy at the table next to
the door. But it happened that the discourses on the
Cosmos were rudely interrupted one evening by the
throwing of a bun from u table that had an oversupply
of huns t.i the the table not so fuvored by the Hock :.nrl
the hashers.
As much as Our Hero believed in manna coming
from the heavens, he decided this would never do, and
fet down the social contract which decides all bun
passing in the Commons now.
First, he said: "Four hours at the Convah'-cent Home
for you."'
Secondly, he dictated: "If you had thrown it under
hand instead of throwing it overhand, you wouldn't
have «?♦)! the hours."
