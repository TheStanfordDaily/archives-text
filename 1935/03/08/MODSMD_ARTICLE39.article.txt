The Man from the Bayous—Huey
|P. Long—has gone berserk again.
'This time his madness has crept be
j v< nd the borders of Louisiana and
| out into the aged solemnity of the
U. S. Senate chambers. He has
screamed and hollered, defied and
defiled.
! Bui there is one significant dif
| ference between Huey Long's sena
i tcrial outbursts and his eake-walk
! i'lg down in Louisiana. His "free
I speech in the Senate was constitu
tional; though the Senate likes more
[dignified harangues, the Senate was
j made to air all manner of opinion.
I P' Long confined himself to Consti
j tutioral criticism, he would not be
j a«..ngerous. But his actions down in
| his country, indicate that Long is no
j respecter of Democratic tradition.
J His actions in Louisiana indicate that
j it Long ever gets into the presiden
j tia! office in the United States, the
'U. S. Constitution will be spanked
I soundly, and sent to bed. Hence is
j Huey a menace.
Huey Long's bluster and dash is
I directed at present against the Roo
j sevelt administration. And the
: Roosevelt administration is defended
| with equal bluster and dash by the
j god-lather of the Blue Eagle—Gen-
I eral Hugh. Johnson. General John
| son says that Huey Long is a mad
J man, and should be silenced. But as
j far as we can see, that is a beautiful
instance of the pot calling the kettle
j black.
j Foi bombast the general cannot be
I beat—even by Huey Long, which is
saying plenty. But more than that,
I though General Johnson is now on
I the patriotic side of the argument,
j*his past record does not credit him
: with e much higher calibre of states-
I manship than is demonstrated by the
| senator from the South.
There are many people who re

J (he Rats" Phi Beta Kappa address at
1 California. There are mai*y who re
i member how he truckled to the in
