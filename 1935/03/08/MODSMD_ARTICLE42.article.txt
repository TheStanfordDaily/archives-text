## Students Threaten Strike When 41 Suspended

Stanford students out on strike?
An impossible thing, most people
will say, and yet back in 1908 the
pall of an impending student strike
actually hung over the university in
the aftermath of what was probably
the greatest scandal in the Farm's
history.
Liquor ran freely over the country
in that first decade of the twentieth
century and apparently the Stanford
campus, was none too dry. In an at
tempt to dry it up the Student Affairs
Committee on March 12, 1908, passed
a resolution denouncing student
drinking in no uncertain terms. And
what a storm it brought!
Paraders Object
That night, following a typical
beer-bust, 247 students, armed with
horns and other noise makers, pa
raded the campus in disdainful ob
jection to the resolution. They start
ed on the Row, marched to Encina,
to the residence of the president of
the committee on student affairs,
back through the library and the
Memorial Court.
The administration was horrified.
Two days later the committee, in one
drastic sweep, suspended 12 students
for "participation in the parade."
Then it was the students' turn to
be horrified. Why suspend 12 who
were no more to blame than the rest
of the 247? The student body for
mally requested the committee to
treat all participants alike.
Strike Suggested
On March 19 a meeting of the en
tire student body was called at
which all but a few faculty members
were unceremoniously ousted. A
strike was suggested. All those who
had participated in the parade put
their names on a petition. Dr. Max
Farrand, head of the history depart
ment, stood up and made a fervent
piea asking students not to strike,
concluding with, "Please God, Stan
ford is going to survive!"
But the committee paid little at
tention to the demands of the stu
dents that the martyred 12 be re
instated. For several days the stu
dents waited anxiously and hopefully
lor action by the committee. Finally
it came.
"Forty-one students suspended,"
read the headlines.
The action was called wholesale
slaughter. A mob gathered around
the post office the day the fatal mes
sages were sent out. Besides the 41
suspensions, several score lost from
five to ten hours each.
Alumni Overruled
At another mass student body
meeting everyone wanting to go out
on strike was asked to sign a list.
Oniy 250 did so. The alumni became
aroused, Dr. Jordan, stood by the
committee, but no further action was
taken. An alumni committee in San
Francisco condemned the action of
the student committee and demanded
the reinstatement of all the sus
pended students. But Jordan scorned
the alumni and the students were not
reinstated. Not since then has Stan
ford seen such violent action within
her confines.
