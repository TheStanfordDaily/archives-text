Hugh S. Johnson (top, right), former administrator of the NRA,
led off with a vigorous counter-attack on the assailants of the adminis
tration, dubbing Father Charles E. Coughlin (lower, left) and Senator
Huey Long (lower right) "mad Pied Pipers" for their political activi
ties. Long replied on the senate floor, savagely criticising the NRA
and the administration. Senator Joseph Robinson (top, left), Demo
cratic leader, replied with a furious barrage designed to put the
Louisiana Kingfish "in his proper place." He roared the time has come
to stop Huey's "ravings." (Associated Press Photos)
