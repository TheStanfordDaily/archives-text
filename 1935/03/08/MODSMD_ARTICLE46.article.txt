# Pelican, Chappie One-Two In Poll; 'Circus' Out Next
## 
### 
In a nation-wide poll of editors of;
college comic magazines, the Stan- J
ford Chaparral was voted the second
best college comic magazine in the ,
country, losing to the California Pel
ican by only three points, it was
revealed by Chappie editor, Gordon ,
Steedman, yesterday.
Steedman received a letter from j
the Texas Ranger, who conducted
the poll, stating that the Pelican
won the contest with points,
while Chaparral was not far be
hind with 90 digits.
"We are mighty proud of Chappie I
in placing only three points behind I
our Hammer and Coffin colleague
across the bay," said Steedman. :
"They have so much more money to !
spend at 'Poor Cal' than we have
down hyar on the Farm, that it really
bespeaks right smart well for the
young fellers of Chappie."
"Circus" Is Coining
Elated by his national x'ecognition
(his magazine was already placed'

best in the country by the Ax-izona
Kitty-Kat, and called most humorous
of the humor magazines by the Tem
ple Owl), Steedman takes out his
long black-snake to whip out the j
''College Comic Circus" number, j
which is coming to town next Thurs- i
day.
An exchange number, "The Cir
cus," will contain the best of art
work from all the leading college
comic magazines. It will also con
tain Steedman's ranking of the
college magazines. "And it will be
pretty rank, too," he says.
Gist, Dawson Garnish
''Hickory Dickory" Dawson is il- ;
lustrating the cover of the Circus,j
while Gil Gist, Jr., is garnishing the |
inside of the magazine. "He's such a i
good garnisher, we're going to put
him on a celery," quotes the cuckoo.
Steedman admonished his tractable ;
youths to get out their pens and pen- i
cils before finals start, and run off
some copy for the "Track Issue," for I
which the deadline is coming soon. |
