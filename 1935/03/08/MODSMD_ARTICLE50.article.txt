I Comedy and tragedy filled the :
J Little Theater last night when Sword i
; and Sandals, men's honorary dru- \
j mafic society, presented Josef and I
, Karel Capek's "The Insect Comedy." j
( Portraying through the lives of in
j sects all the foolishness, vanity, and !
i weakness of the human race, the j
Capek brothers have built a biting !
! and satirical drama that moves from j
\ light comedy to a powerful dramatic ]
I climax.
Largest Cast ,
With the largest cast ever to ap- |
! pear in a Stanford play reading,
[ Sword and Sandals have given the
, play a worthy production. No one j
j person can be singled out for act
; inj honors. The play gave equal im-
I portance to many roles and all were
j capably filled.
| It is through the eyes of a worth- j
j less vagrant, ably played by Paul
| Crary, that the audience is brought j
I to the insect world.
Benet, Albertson Star
In the first act, concerning itself !
with the life and flirtations of the
j butterflies, James Benet and Jean
| Albertson were, as usual, in light
dialogue, outstanding.
! 01 the creepers and the crawlers,
; whose greed and avarice were por
trayed in the second act, Charles
; Denny, Joe Lawry, and Frances
Burks were particularly good.
Hypocrisy Shown
I In the last act, which exposed the
hypocrisy of war and the methods of
fomenting it through the lives of the
red and yellow ants, and in the epi
logue, no one character had even j
j a leading role.
Limitations of space prevent pick- ,
j out for praise individual members of
\ a uniformly excellent supporting j
j cast. Several innovations in staging, |
conceived by William Kirk and Wal- j
ter Newcomb, and the direction of j
i Frank O'Neill were also most praise- '
J worthy.
