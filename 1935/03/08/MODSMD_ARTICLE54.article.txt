# Honghs Read Light Fiction
## Librarian Contends Women Prefer Better Books 
### Robert Eisenbach 
The deep-browed Stanford male
who talks in academic conundrums
hasn't nearly the literary taste of
his "flightier" female contemporary,
according to James R. Broughton,
who dishes out literary relaxation to
students from his circulating library
in the Union Cellar.
Men go almost exclusively for
light fiction, murder mysteries
mostly, while women read William
Faulkner and Ernest Hemingway
when they want to take their minds
off examinations and classes.
"They read heavier stuff to im
prove their table talk," Broughton
believes. "For some reason, they
think that the more intellectual they
are the better hit they make. If male
book selections are any indication,
Stanford men are anything but
brainy."
As for reading speed, Stanford stu
dents have it all over their profes
sors, Broughton revealed. The aver
ago rough or coed finishes a book in
about half the time it takes his in
structor.
His biggest business is around
week-end and vacation periods. Then
ho finds students stocking up for
some nice comfortable reading-in
fced. Business drops off somewhat
during final period, but picks up just
before midquurters, when literary
reports are due in certain English
classes.
