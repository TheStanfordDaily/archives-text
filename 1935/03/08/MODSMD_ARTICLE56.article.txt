# Biologist Shifts Embryo Cells, Reaps Freaks
## Twitty Produces Frog's Eye From Leg Structure 
### 
Man-made miniature monsters â€”'
normal water-dogs sporting a whole'
eye in the middle of its back, a j
mammoth foot on its foreleg, or a
dangling leg from its forehead.
Such are the creatures that are
produced by deft grafting experi
ments in the School of Biology by
Assistant Professor Victor Twitty.
Down in the basement laboratories
of the biology department, dozens oi
frog and salamander embryos are
laid open and their parts shuffled
around for the purpose of studying j
the development of the organisms.
Awkward monsters are produced, 1
but at the same time invaluable re- i
search work is accomplished.
Leg Cells Become Eye
As a result of the grafting, for ex
ample, it has been found that: an J
embryo cut in half in its early stages |
will develop into two normal sep*t- j
rate animals; a group of cells which ,
would normally grow into legs can '
be grafted into an eye position and
they will grow into an eye; an organ
grafted to a new position will grow j
just as well in its new environment, j
but will not have normal functions |
due to faulty nerve connections.
The findings also reveal that Siam
ese twins can be produced by graft
ing two whole embryos together; that
a slow growing eye, for example, can
be grafted on a faster developing ani
mal and the speed of the eye's
growth will not change; that an or
gan from a California salamander
grafted onto one of another species
will completely paralyse the host.
Frogs Best Subjects
Professor Twitty revealed that the !
frogs and salamanders are about the
only animals on which really suc
cessful experiments can be carried
out.
The purpose of the experiments, as
might be imagined, is not to deter
mine how successfully grafting can
be carried out. Rather, the purpose
is to observe the development of the
embryo or egg, to try to find out
what is behind the various trans
formations, and to see what effect a
new environment will have on a
transplanted organ.
