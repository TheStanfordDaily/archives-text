## TROJAN FIVE HONORED 
### 
Among the more interesting of the
1935 all-conference quintets was the
one chosen by the sport editor of The
Daily Trojan. The first string: the
Trojan varsity. Keith Topping and
Dinty Moore of the Indians made the
second string, the former winning a
forward position.
Moore also made an all-conference
five chosen by the California var
sity, and another chosen by Coach
Nibs Price of the Golden Bears.
