# ABOUT THE 14.2 HURDLE MARK
## 
### 
Phil Duffy has a yarn about John
Wood, Cal's high-stepping junior
transfer hurdler, who will give any
body on the coast a stiff race this
year. Alter setting a couple of coun
y records in Eastbay track circles,
v, oo spent iwo years at Sacramento
Junior College getting his rec's for
U.C.
Besides taking third in the Na
tional A.A.U. high hurdles in 1933,
Wood had another satisfactory af
ernoon taking the barriers for the
junior college.
It was at the Northern California
junior college championships last
year. Wood won the highs going
away as expected, but the officials
were highly embarrassed when the
stop watches gave a time of 14.2
seconds, the fastest mark recorded
on the coast. They decided some
thing was wrong, and Russ Sweet,
Mcnlo coach, finally relieved the
situation by announcing that the
course was three yards short of the
necessary 120 yards
By this time the officials were
thoroughly flustered, so much so that
they made the mistake of telling
Wood that they would give him a
time of 15 flat for his hurdle race.
Well, 15 flat meant nothing to Wood.
He'd been running that for three
years.
"Heck, no!" he came hack. "I'll
run it over." He did and went the
lull 120 yards in 14.(5 seconds. Won
der what he really did run his
first flight in?
GufT: Coach Dean Cromwell of
Trojan tracksters tells The Daily
Trojan boys to take it easy on pub
licity for his team . . . but a few
lightning bolts have got out of Bo
vard Field . . . for example, a frosh
who has thrown a javelin 214 feet
9 inches already this year . . . Mil
ner is ths name, and also from Texas,
as is the 14-foot S.C. pole vaulter,
Earl Meadows . . . they say Jimmy
Kneu'ouhl, Stanford frosh, ran a
quarter in 48.9 in prep school the
first time he ever tried it . . . Among
the more exciting spectacles on the
coast this year will be the hurdle
races . . . Stanford's got champ Sam
Klopsfock . . . Cal has four good men
... Sophomore Phil Cope of the Tro
jans has a mark of 14.8 seconds in
the highs already . . . Jerry Gracin,
substitute Trojan hoopster, has
jumped 6 feet 4 inches as a prep in
Indiana . . . Cal's nine-letter man,
Dave Meek, won't be able to step
into the shotput circle now that the
hoop season is over . . . he's to be
hospitalized for a few injuries incur
red during football, basketball, track
for three and a half years ... A week
or so ago we tried to catch up with
the rapidly increasing number of
good coast 2-milers . . . we missed
on Norm Bright, Indian ineligible,
with a time of 9 minutes 35 seconds
. . . One Sunday afternoon, accord
ing to a belter authority, Bright was
clocked in 9:23.8 . . . not bad, with
Washington claiming the coast record
for her man, Eb Sellers, who ran
9:27.3 . . . Sellers, they say, is re
turning for the rest of his collegiate
competition this year . . . The Hus
kies have another track great in Bill
Vandermay, a frosh with a high jump
mark of 6 feet 4 inches . . . Eddie
Galbraith, good enough as a sopho
more last year to get the second base
job on Harry Wolter's Indian nine,
i;-; now enrolled at California. . .
We started in getting excited over
the Card quintet chances in the
l: .vo race, knowing that the Trojan
champs were losing Lee Guttero, Er
nie Holbrook, Hop Findley, and
Parking Joe Kelly out of their first
string . . . but S.C. had somewhat
of a frosh team . . . undefeated . . . i
the Trojans meet Oregon State for
ihe pjay-off this week end . . . it's
in Corvallis, and the Oregon five
has never lost a game in the home
gym.
