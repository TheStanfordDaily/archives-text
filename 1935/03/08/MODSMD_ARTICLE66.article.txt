# CARDINAL NETMEN HOLD CONFERENCE MEET WITH REARS
## Rain Halts Play As Indians Lead in Victories 
### 
Playing around alternately with a
barrage of tennis balls or a gust of
rain, Stanford's varsity netmen open
ed their conference season yesterday
in auspicious style against California.
When four singles matches had
been tallied, the Cards had tucked
away four wins, but Father Jupiter
became playful, and the remaining
five matches will be played tomor
row at 1:30.
Two singles matches and three
doubles remain to be determined,
and Stanford needs but one more
| victory to cinch the match. Up
against a far inferior team, the much
heralded varsity netmen were given
quite a scare by the Bears in the
matches played.
Lec Wins Match
Captain Sammy Lee, playing num
ber one match against Dick Ben
nett of Berkeley, had no strength to
his shots, was outguessed at the net,
and after playing to deuce in the
third and deciding set for almost an
hour, finally came through to beat
Bennett. Lee was in bad form, but
the courts did not contribute to the
quality of tennis produced. Scores
were 7-5; 2-6; 9-7.
Jack Lynch played smoothly to
win over Perry Schwartz, football
minded racket wielder, by straight
sets. Lynch had Schwartz under
control at all times, winning S-3;
6-2.
Law Takes Singles
In the third singles, John Law of
Stanford made less errors than Don
White of U.C., and won by scores of
6-4; 6-2. Bob Pommer, playing at
sixtn singles for the Indians, had all
he could do to win over Tanaka,
Japanese varsity netman from Ber
keley, finally winning, 3-6; 6-0; 8-6.
Bill Sewax'd started his match with
Paul Newton, and played listlessly,
managed to drop the first set. The
match was stopped in the second
stanza by rain, however, and will be
played over tomorrow.
