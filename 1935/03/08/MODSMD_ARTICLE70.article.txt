# Stanford Swimmers To Enter Team Meet
## Cards Favored To Defeat Eight Other Squads 
### Herb Diamond 
Well - primed after a week of j
intensive workouts, Coach Nort j
Thornton's Indian swim squad leaves '
lor Oakland tomorrow afternoon j
where they will engage in a battle j
at the Lakeside indoor plunge for
the Northern California team cham
pionship. Heats are scheduled to be
oin at 3:30 o'clock; finals have been
set for 8 o'cloclc.
The Card mermen, although fa
vored to cop the title by a 4- or 5-
jjoint margin, will doubtlessly stage
a neck and neck tilt for honors with
-he strong "Wandering Raiders" of
violden Gate Junior College and Cal
ifornia. Six other teams, including
San Jose State, S.F.U., Menlo J. C.,
Y.M.C.A., Athens Athletic Club, and
the Lakeside Swimming Club, will
supply further competition.
The Golden Gate swimmers will
i.ave to do without the services of
■ two of their strongest men—Gilman,
ace back-stroker, who was seriously
injured in an auto accident this week,
and Walker, breast stroke threat,
wr.o is on the sick list. The fact that
these two will be absent from the
lineup has put the Cards slightly
ahead of the field on the dope sheet.
Breast Stroke Close
One of the most sensational races
should be the 220-yard breast stroke
event. Stanford's Captain Bobby
Foster in this event faces strenuous
competition from young Walter
Teasdale, the stellar California fresh
man. Foster is the defending cham
pion and also holds the Pacific As
sociation record at this distance,
while Teasdale turned in the fastest
200 yards ever swum on the Pacific
Coast in last Saturday's meet with
the Stanford yearlings.
The Cardinal's 400 - yard relay
team of Scatena, Hoover, Doyle, and
Kulin hope for a victory. A large
portion of Stanford's title chances
re„>ts upon Fitting, Foster, and Kuhn
in the medley relay.
Point-Getters Picked
Others favored as potential point
winners include Harvey, in the 220-
yard breast stroke; Peterson and
Clemo, in the 440 free style; Hoover
in the 220 free; and Friedman and
Boothe in diving.
The dope sheet rates Stanford at
first in the 400-yard l'elay, U.C. to
take the .150 back stroke, Stanford
to come through in the 220 breast
stroke, U.C. to top the field in the
50-yard free, the 440 to go to Menlo,
the 100 to Golden Gate, Lakeside to
out-dive everyone else, Menlo to
take the 220 free, and Stanford to
j gerner honors in the medley relay.

i lowing lineup to Oakland:
