# Ruggers Not Sure Of Canadian Trip; No Reply Receivod
## Stanford Coaches Hopeful Of Vancouver Jaunt; May Play Bears 
### Warren Breed 
Nothing was definite last night on
Rugby Row.
Negotiations were still incomplete
as to the playing of games with ei
ther the University of California
ruggers tomorrow afternoon or
British Columbia teams during the
spring vacation.
A1 Masters had stipulated agree
able terms in messages to both op
ponents, but neither had sent word
by press time. Contrary to reports
in the San Francisco papers, the
Canadian series is not definitely
called off.
Trek Fairly Certain
Coaches Jim Wylie and Harry Ma
loncy were fairly certain that their
Card fifteen would make the trek
north. Their case goes something
like this:
1. Stanford is champion of the
California Rugby Union.
2. Stanford beat California, the
only other prospect for the northern
trip.
3. Stanford would be able to play
three or four games in British Co
lumbia, as they will have practically
two weeks of lee-way from classes
over the spring vacation.
4. California, with a negligible
four-day vacation, would not be able
to play any more than two games,
which would not be sufficient to
merit them the financial guarantee
agreed to by the Canadians.
5. Stanford will go north if a fa
vorable reply is received from Van
couver.
Stanford Willing
Cards and Bears may play off their
little grudge tomorrow afternoon, to
decide the intercollegiate champion
ship. If the rivals do not tangle it
will not be any fault of • Stanford's,
for the Cards are willing to play and
are confident of again coming out on
top. If they play, the will be
either at Berkeley, Stanford, or
Kezar. Muddy playing fields is an
other nebulous quantity.
The Canadian series has been a
tit-for-tat, see-saw affair so far this
winter. First they invited Stanford
up, which proved impossible. Then
they were invited down here, still
no go. Now they again offered invi
tations for the spring vacation, Mas
ters accepted, but they are in doubt.
Meanwhile, Jim Wylie watched his
boys take informal workouts yester
day in the mud, and will keep an
eye on them until further develop
ments, break.
