# CARD POLOISTS GO NORTHWARD
## Varsity Will Battle O.S.C. On Indoor field 
### 
Stanford's varsity poloists, accom- (
, panied by Coach Lt. Hayden Grubbs,
j departed yesterday afternoon for
i Corvallis, where they will engage in
a two-game series with the Oregon
j State mallet - swingers over the j
! week-end. Those making the trip!
1 are Bob Fullerton, Bill Enemark,
j Bill Rogers, and James Henderson,
; of which the first three will form the
| opening line-up.
The Card riders may be consul
■ erably handicapped by the lack of
space on the indoor field of the
| Northerners, as it necessitates the
I elimination of the number four I
; man. Coach Grubb's men have be- j
come accustomed to lining up with
number four in the defensive po
j sition, and his absence may prove
i disconcerting to the rest of the
team, who arc in the habit of let -
; ting him handle the defensive
j saves.
' Another factor which should raise
| the chances of the Staters is the
Stanfordites' unfamiliarity with their
mounts. Handling strange and per
haps inferior mounts in a hard
fought game is a tough assignment
for even such experienced riders as
I Fullerton, Enemark, and Rogers.
While the Cards should be fa- J
vored on the basis of previous !
games between the two outfits, re
ports from the North imply the i
Beavers have a hard-riding and
vastly improved squad, which j
should be capable of providing
Grubb's horsemen with two tough
contests.
Next quarter the Northerners will ;
journey to the farm where two re
turn contests will be played between '
• the teams.
