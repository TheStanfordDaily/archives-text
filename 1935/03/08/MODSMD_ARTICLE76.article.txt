# Frosh Racket Wielders Practice for Matches
## 
### 
Breaking even in its first two
matches, against the tennis clubs of
1 Berkeley and Palo Alto, the Stan- '
ford freshman tennis squad is now !
completing its ninth week of prac- '
tice in preparation for the hard t
I matches of the next three weeks.
San Mateo Junior College looms as '
j the next match, and barring rain it I
I will be held this week-end. A ten- ,
1 tative meet during spring vacation
' with either the strong Trojan fresh- 1
man team or that of U.C.L.A. is j
being planned. In any case, the lat
ter match will be of an informal na- :
i ture and only a few men will be sent j
; south.
