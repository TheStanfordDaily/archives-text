# PUGILISTS DEFEND EDGE OVER BEARS WITH NEW LINE-UP
## Fight To Repeat 5-3 Win; Reynolds In Bout 
### Mort D'Evelyn 
Indian mittmen will swap punches
with the University of California
boxers in return bouts at 8:00 o'clock
tonight in the Harmon Gymnasium,
Berkeley.
The Cards will defend the 5 to J
victory which they gained in the
first series of bouts three weeks
ago. Since that time, however,
Stanford has lost the services of
its captain, Sims de Veuve, winner
of the 169-pound fight.
Their position as favorites was also
lowered with the loss of A1 Velarde,
flyweight, with a broken nose. The
fight in this division has been for
feited to California.
In the feature heavyweight bout
Stanford's grid tackle Bob Reynolds
will meet California's grid tackle,
Bob Carleton. Ray Jacks, Golden
Bear guard, will battle Ralph Mac-
Michaels of the Cards in a heavy
weight exhibition bout. Another
football man, Keith Topping, of Stan
ford. was also scheduled to fight but
v/as forced to withdraw at the last
minute because of an injured wrist.
Both teams have changed their
line-up considerably since the first
meeting. In return engagements,
George Thurston of the Bears will
attempt to duplicate his third round
technical victory over Ralph Purdy
of Stanford; Barney Greenlee, Indian
light-heavy, will try for another de
cision over "Buck" Francis; and
Bill Winsler, Card, will be favored
for another win over Hilton Taylor
in the 129-pound division.
