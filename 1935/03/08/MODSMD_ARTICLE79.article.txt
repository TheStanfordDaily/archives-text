# U.S.C., U.C.L.A. Silent On Four-Way Track Meet
## 
### 
No word had been received from
the south last night concerning the
proposed four-way track meet be
tween California, Stanford, U.S.C.,
and U.C.L.A. scheduled tentatively
for May 18 at Stanford.
Early in the week both California
and Stanford agreed to enter the
meet, but whether or not the Bruins
and the Trojans would join in a re
newal of the California Intercolle
giates will probably not be learned
until next week.
