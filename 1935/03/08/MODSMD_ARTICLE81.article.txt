# FROSH BATSMEN MEET SAN JOSE
## 
### 
Frosh batsmen play San Jose Stale
Reserves at 10 o'clock tomorrow
mommg on the frosh diamond. It is
the last game for the frosh before
they tangle with the California Cubs
in a three-game series, the first
game of which is to be played here
April 6.
As yet no announcement of the
line-up for tomorrow's game has
been made.
In their game against Menlo J.C.
last Tuesday which they won 2 to 0,
the yearlings fielded much better
than they have in previous games,
not making a single error. But their
batting was not as good as in the
past.
Milkmen in Providence, R. 1., de
liver oysters as well as milk.
