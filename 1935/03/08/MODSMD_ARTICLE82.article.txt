# Bob Foster To Enter National Swim Meet
## Stanford's Breaststroker Is Only Representative Of Local Team 
### 
Captain of the swimming team,
holder of American and Intercolle
giate breast stroke records, on the
Second Ail-Coast water polo team
for two years and voted most valu
able man on the Stanford swimming
team are the high points of athletic
achievement of Bob Foster, Stanford
senior. *
In three weeks Foster will be at
Harvard as Stanford's only entry in
the National Collegiate swimming
competition. Coach Thornton has
high hopes that Foster will win a
championship in the breast stroke.
"Bob has never been beaten in col
lege swimming, and is, I believe, the
best man ot his event on the west
coast," Thornton continued. "He
works hard and has developed re
markable endurance. He has a
smooth, powerful stroke plus the
ability to do better under compe
tition."
He is an honor student in his Social
Science major, is house manager of
the Sigma Nu fraternity, and a mem
ber of the Phi Phi honorary society.
When asked what he intended to
do next year, he replied, "I plan to
go into municipal government and
later state politics. However, 1 would
like to work my way on some world
travels before I settle down to busi
ness. As regards trying out for the
Olympics I am undecided.
Bob's home is in Long Beach, and
before coming to Stantord he spent
two years at Long Beach Junior Col
lege.
In answer to a question on Stan
ford swimming, Foster replied that
he thought the facilities excellent.
"The pools are as good as any on the
coast. I can't praise coaches Thorn
ton or Brandsten enough. They are
responsible to a degree for the splen
did spirit of the team, but I also want
to congratulate the fellows them
selves.
