# CARDINAL NINE TO MEET ST. MARY'S ON MORAGA FIELD
## Tomorrow's Tlit Will See Anderson On Mound 
### 
Twenty-two varsity baseball men
have been selected by Coach Harry
Wolter to journey to Moraga tomor
row afternoon to try to avenge an
earlier defeat at the hands of St.
Mary's nine.
Wolter plans to start Co-Cap
lair. Stan Anderson on the mound.
Anderson has looked good in his
few starts so far, and is rapidly
gaining his old-time form. Mike
Ferro will ofTiciate behind the bat.
As the league schedule gets under
way, Wolter feels that he at last is
gelling together nine hustlers who
have the "will to win" as well as
the necessary ability. Although drop
ping their first league game to the
Gaels Tuesday, the Indians still have
a chance to win the pennant. All
their games with U.C.L.A., South
ern California, and California re
main to be played, as well as the two
additional games with St. Mary's.
The regular lineup of Mallatratt,
Woolley, Hamilton, Tremaine, Brent,
Leidig, and Holman will start. Her
inger, Campbell, and Semmelroth
will be ready to relieve Anderson on
tin mound.
The Gael lineup remains as Owens,
Flynn, Harris, Hanna, Magrini,
Sneed, Hinckley, and Desimone.
Steely, whose speed subdued Indian
batters Tuesday, will give way to
another right-handed chucker, who
is rumored equally potent. Desimone,
Hanna, and Magrini lead the Gael
attack, the former with three hits
Tuesday.
Red Holman, Card clean-up
man. is still hanging back in his
batting slump, although most of
his teammates are beginning to find
their batting eye. Holman plans to
leave his number "13" jersey home
tomorrow, in hopes of grabbing
himself a flock of bingles.
Atter tomorrow's contest the Cards
meet the Gaels again on Wednesday
and then take time ofT until spring
vacation. At that time Wolter' will
lake a select group to San Diego to
meet Uncle Sam's marines there in
j two games. Then the full team will
j take on U.S.C. and U.C.L.A. in two
tilts apiece.
Three games with Cal and the ad
j ditional one with the two southerr
schools in the spring will end the
| season.

batters Tuesday, will give way to
another right-handed chucker, who
is rumored equally potent. Desimone,

Twenty-two varsity baseball men
have been selected by Coach Harry
Wolter to journey to Moraga tomor
row afternoon to try to avenge an
earlier defeat at the hands of St.
Mary's nine.
Wolter plans to start Co-Cap
lair. Stan Anderson on the mound.
Anderson has looked good in his
few starts so far, and is rapidly
gaining his old-time form. Mike
Ferro will ofTiciate behind the bat.
As the league schedule gets under
way, Wolter feels that he at last is
gelling together nine hustlers who
have the "will to win" as well as
the necessary ability. Although drop
ping their first league game to the
