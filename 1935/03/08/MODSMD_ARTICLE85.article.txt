Huskies Strong
While there is little doubt that the
j Cards will be able to defeat the Dons
| with little difficulty, their chance of
| winning the Husky indoor meet is
not so certain. With the exception of
the weights, the northern school has
[a well-rounded squad which prom
ises to show well in dual meet comp
etition.
In the sprints the Huskies will have
three closely matched men, Bruce
Humber, Frank Plumb, and Ken Kil

! seconds for the 75-yard straightaway

The Huskies are also showing
i strong early season possibilities in
| the hurdles, with Jack Lipscomb,
I former Washington state prep
' champ, leading. Bob Swisher, north
j west high jump champion, will also
| be entered in the high hurdles. These
: two should give Sam Klopstock of
| the Cards a battle.
! Other unusual strength is devel
. oping- in the distance runs with the
I return of Eb Sellers, holder of the
I coast 2-mile record, for further com
: petition. In Ariel Sedmiston the Hus
kies have another 2-miler whom
| Rusty March and Dave Devlin,
' Stanford entrants, will have diffi
! culty defeating.
Mile Duel Expected
Jimmy Angle, another Washington
I state prep champion of two years
j ago, is the leading miler, and has a
mark of 4 minutes 33.6 seconds al
| ready this spring. A great three-cor-
I nered duel should develop between
Angle and Chuck Nimmo and War
ren Dixon of Stanford.

Mile Duel Expected
Jimmy Angle, another Washington
I state prep champion of two years
j ago, is the leading miler, and has a
mark of 4 minutes 33.6 seconds al

I nered duel should develop between
Angle and Chuck Nimmo and War
ren Dixon of Stanford.
j Other leading Husky contenders

include Drury, a quarter-miler with
an early mark of 52.1 seconds; Ror
scheib, with a 194-foot javelin throw
recently; Childs, 12-foot 4-inch pole
vaulter; and Palmasson, a half-miler
who ran 2 minutes 1.1 seconds two

Huskies Strong
While there is little doubt that the
j Cards will be able to defeat the Dons
| with little difficulty, their chance of
| winning the Husky indoor meet is
not so certain. With the exception of
the weights, the northern school has
[a well-rounded squad which prom
ises to show well in dual meet comp
etition.
In the sprints the Huskies will have
three closely matched men, Bruce
Humber, Frank Plumb, and Ken Kil
lien. The former has a mark of 7.7
! seconds for the 75-yard straightaway
in the Washington pavilion, two
tenths of a second slower than the
j record set last year by Bob Kiesel of
California.
Good Hurdlers
The Huskies are also showing
i strong early season possibilities in
| the hurdles, with Jack Lipscomb,
I former Washington state prep
' champ, leading. Bob Swisher, north
j west high jump champion, will also
| be entered in the high hurdles. These
: two should give Sam Klopstock of
| the Cards a battle.
