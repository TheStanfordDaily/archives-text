# CARD, DON FROSH DUAL TRACK MEET DEPENDS ON SUN
## Better Weather Necessary, Says Bill Ellington 
### Gordon Frost 
With Angell Field looking more
like a swimming pool than a track
field, Stanford's frosh cinder team is
looking toward weather conditions
to decide whether its scheduled meet
with U.S.F. frosh tomorrow morn
ing will be held or not. Coach Bill
Ellington declared that if more rain
fell last night the event would prob
ably be postponed.
If bad weather forbids the meet,
chances for its being held before
vacation are few since university
regulations prohibit any athletic
events the week before final exami
nations. The same regulation may
prevent holding the twice-postponed
San Mateo J.C. meet scheduled lor
next Wednesday afternoon.
The frosh squad, with bad weather
badly jumbling its early season
meets, is hoping that Old Sol will
show his face for the tilts scheduled
for the week-ends preceding and
following vacation.
On the Saturday following finals,
March 23, Ellington's men will meet
the Peninsula All-Stars and on the
following Saturday, March 30, they
will play hosts to Sacrarpento J.C.
Fifteen men will stay over through
the holidays to participate in the two
meets.
Sacramento is reported to have
one of the strongest J.C. teams in
Northern California and according to
Ellington, "could give our varsity
some good competition.
The All-Stars, although not par
ticularly strong, have amassed good
material from most of the Peninsula
towns and will undoubtedly worry
the frosh considerably.
