# Daily Ceases As Members of Staff Become Studious
## 
### 
"Forced to Quit! We Close Our
Doors! Everything Must Go! Yours
at a Sacrifice!" thuSly did the happy,
smiling cherubs who make up that
great machine known as the Daily
Staff whistle and yell last night as
they threw the paper in the forms,
and departed for their dov/ny beds.
In deference to the faculty's pro
pensity for giving examinations at
about this time of year, the Daily
Staff, which has been so busy writ
ing stories about nationally known
orchestras who play for dances, mar
velous decorations, extensive themes,
and irrationally known dance chair
men all quarter that it has not had
time to slap the books in the ap
proved nunner, will take a few
weeks' vacation to joust with the
volumes.
In other words, this is the last
Daily ol' the quarter. Requiescat in
Pace!
