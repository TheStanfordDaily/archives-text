# Words of David Lamson On Death Day 'Natural'
## 
### 
Attempting to show that David
Lamson's actions on the morning of |
May 30, 1933, were perfectly natural!
up to the time that he came to the I
front door and cried out that his j
wife was dead, Edwin V. McKen/.ie,
defense chief, brought out two im- i
portant statements from state wit
nesses yesterday in Judge Robert R. |
Syer's court in San Jose where Lam- \
son's second fight for his life is being
waged.
The first was that it was not at all
unusual for Lamson to build a fire
when working in the yard. Miss i
Helen Vincent of (jls Lasuen, neigh
bor of the Lamsons, testified that
Lamson worked in the yard fairly
olten and "nearly always built a tire |
when he worked."
Defense Pleased
She also testified that fires had;
occasionally been built on the same ;
spot when former Stanford profes
sor George R. Harrison lived in the
house which was later occupied by '
the Lamsons.
A main argument by assistant
prosecuting attorney Allen P. Lind
say has been that tire was built
to remove blood stains from an iron
pipe which he claims was used by
Lamson to murder his wife.
Again the defense seemed pleased
when the two state witnesses who'
observed Lamson as he made the ,

statement that his wife was dead, did
not agree on whether Lamson said.
\ ' killed" or "murdered." Mrs. Lloyd
M. Place, Palo Aito rental agent, de
| dared:
Quibble Over Phrase
"I saw a man who looked wildly
excited and threw up his hands and
said, 'My God, my wife has been
murdered.' "
Mrs. Alfred Raas, client of Mrs.
Place, described Lamson's statement
I as:
"My God, my wife has been
killed."
This is significant in that the state
has based a good deal of its fight on
the premise that Lamson had it on
his mind that his wife was murdered.
Court Crowded
A crowded courtroom heard the
. tragic story of the discovery of Al
lene Lamson's body in the blood
i stained bathroom of the Lamson cot
tage at 622 Salvatierra on the Stan
ford campus related for the third
1 time, as defense and state attorneys
wrangled over law terms and called
each other names.
Mrs. Buford O. Brown, who lives
across the street from the Lamson
home, and is the widow of former
Starilord Prof. Buford O. Brown, who
committed suicide recently follow
ing a long illness, took the stand late
in the alternoon to give her version
| again in a weak, strained voice.
