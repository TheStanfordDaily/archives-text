cording to Professor C. R. Tolman of

who has been in charge of exam
ining the proposed sites, will prob

â–  "These dams are to be built for
j the purpose of replenishing the un
-1 derground water supply, which in
; some regions has been pumped down
! to 110 feet below the natural level of
j the water table," said the economic
: geologist.
