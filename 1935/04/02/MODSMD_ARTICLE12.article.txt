HONOLULU, April I (/P).â€”Out of
prefabricated pieces cut like a jig
saw puzzle, a model village for men
and machinery will rise soon on the
shores of Kaneohe bay near here,
the first halt of the Pan-American
Airways projected six-hop flight
across the Pacific to China.
While surveyors and laborers fell
Jo work today at Mokapu Point, a
slender neck of land half encircling
the coral reefed bay, to prepare the
site for radio towers, housing ma
terial ready to assemble was trans
ported by truck to the village site.
