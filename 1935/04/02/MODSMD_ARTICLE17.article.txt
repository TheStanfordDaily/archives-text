potent ball clubs. They take the

line-up.

captain and pitcher, who will not be
needed on the mound today but
whose batting is among the best.

short-stop for the last month, is
back in his old left field spot. Ted
Leidig remains in center.

Ed Clark at short, Howell Turner at
.second, is starting his first varsity
first.

playing good ball in the preceding
tills.

did heavy stick work in this contest.
On the following two days the
Bruins of U.C.L.A., present league

■Stanford's varsity baseball team
plays host to Sam Barry's strong
Trojan nine this afternoon on the
sunken diamond.
The Cards spent their vacation in
the southland, where they won two
and lost five games against some
potent ball clubs. They take the
field today with a new and different
line-up.
Darrell Holman, big right fielder
and clean-up man, broke his leg only
two days before the trip; his place
will be taken by Fred Heringer, co
captain and pitcher, who will not be
needed on the mound today but
whose batting is among the best.
Bones Hamilton, who filled in at
short-stop for the last month, is
back in his old left field spot. Ted
Leidig remains in center.
Coach Harry Wolter will use for
his infield Frank Tremaine at third,
Ed Clark at short, Howell Turner at
.second, is starting his first varsity
first.
Turner at Second
Turner, replacing Jim Woolley at
second ,is starting his first varsity
ball game. A frosh star last year,
basketball kept him from turning
out until several weeks ago. The
veteran Woolley ruptured ligaments
in his shoulder in a melee at second
base during the first S.C. game, after
playing good ball in the preceding
tills.
Oct. Morgan, who played his first
on the southern trip, will start be
hind )he bat today, replacing Mike
Ferro.
Johnny Campbell will take the
mound, with Co-captain Stan An
derson also ready for duty. Baseball
Joe Gonzales, the sensational S.C.
sophomore chucker, will probably
start for Troy.

hibition of the week. On the follow

score. Ferris, Clark, and Tremaine
