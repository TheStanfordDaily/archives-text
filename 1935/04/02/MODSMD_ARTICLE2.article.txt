In order to cinalyze the true stu

ing cream to tuxedoes," as Business
Manager Bob Herman puts it, mem
bers of the Stanford Daily staff will
institute a market survey of the cam
pus beginning tomorrow morning.
Ten per cent of the student body
will be interviewed personally by
staff members who seek information
relative to what Stanford men and
women have bought within the past
year, what their most prized posses
sions are, and what purchasing
power they have developed, if any,
as demonstrated by the actual
amount of money spent. The inter
viewing activities are under the
guidance of Chuck Chappell, who
announces that the owner of every
tenth name in the Bawlout will be
questioned.
The last survey, held two years
ago, proved that the average Stan
ford woman spent exactly $361. M
per year for wearing apparel, while
the average housewife invests but
$236 annually in her appearance. The
current survey will serve to unearth
similar facts.
"Answer truthfully, accurately,
and carefully if you are one of the
chosen 10 per cent," says Chappell,
"as the results are quite significant
to the Daily business staff."
