# Witnesses Bring Sensational Evidence to Trial of Lamson
## 
### 
Sensation aplenty featured the
Lamson trial in the interim since
the last Daily. One of the major
surprises of the trial came when
Mrs. Elsie Hail, Stanford telephone
operator, told of overhearing a con
versation between Lamson and Mrs.
Sara Kelley, attractive young divor
cee whom the state claims Lamson
was in love with.
According to Mrs. Hall, Lamson
said, "I love you, Sara, and I don't
give a damn if the whole world
knows it!" An audible gasp went
through the court room, and Lam
son, sitting alone, drew back his
mouth Into a thin line and appeared
chagrined.
Chauffeur T-Â»lks
A colorful witness for the state
was Nick Vojdovich, Mayfield chauf
feur. who testified that he saw Lam
son parked in a blue roadster on a
road near Lake Lagunita at 2:30 on
the morning of his wife's death.

With him, said Vojdovich, was a
blond, curly-headed woman, a de
scription which had previously been
applied to Sara Kelley.
Another sensation was occasioned
when Dr. Clement Arnold revealed
that he had had an artery in his own
head cut to see how far the blood
would spurt, ft spurted but a scant
18 inches, far short of the five feet
which the defense will claim that
blood from Mrs. Lamson spurted.
Arnold was a short, fussy man,
obviously sure of himself. When a
press photographer, in the corridor
after the trial session, attempted to
photograph the large bandage on
his head, he turned on the man and
lashed out furiously, knocking the
camera from his hand.
"The Woman" Testifies
But the biggest sensation of the
entire trial was when MeKenzie, on
the opening day of the defense's
case, called a Mrs. Neil Simonds to
the stand. The woman, tall, attrac
tive, and brown-haired, was a

stranger to the entire court room,
and it was not until the third ques
tion, "What, was your name before
you were married?" and the reply,
"Sara M. Kelley," that spectators
realized what was occurring.
Mrs. Kelley, who attended Stan
ford from 1921 to 1924 and knew
both Mr. and Mrs. Lamson here, de
nied ever having had a conversation
with Lamson such as Mrs. Hall had
U)ld of. She also denied that Lamson
bought her lingerie or other gifts.
It was another man, to whom she
was then engaged, that had bought
her the lingerie, she said.
Her relations with Lamson she
termed "strictly business," and she
told reporters in the press room
after the trial session that she "was
never in love with Lamson and
never would be." She also said that
she was playing bridge on the night
that Mrs. Lamson met her death
and therefore could not have been
"the blond in the roadster," men
tioned by Vojdovich.
