Renowned in both Europe and
America, this singer has long been
hailed as a unique figure in the mu
sical world. Every year adds to his
fame and gives his name new sig
nificance. Critics have termed him
"a legendary giant bringing beauty

Ellis once exclaimed, "the seal of
a serene and mysterious power, aloof
from the world."
Interesting I.ife
Chaliapin's life has been an inter
esting one. Born in poverty in Ka
zan, Russia, he soon knew the trag
edy of misery and hardship. Sing
ing was his passion, even in early
childhood. From humble begin
nings in the village church choir,
through small theatres from town
to town, he soon reached the capi
tal of Russia. At the age of 20 he
was engaged by the Russian Impe
rial Opera, and from then on his
life has been a continuous triumph
ant success both in opera and on the
concert stage.
During the season of 1907-08
chaliapin made his first appear
ance at the Metropolitan Opera
House in New York, in the opera,
"Mefistofele." Among the other op
eras in which he appeared during
the brief engagement were "The
Barber of Seville" — and "Faust."
This was followed by a brilliant sea
son in Russian opera in London.
Chaliapin was kept busy fulfilling
engagements abroad in both opera
and concert until 1014, when he re
turned to Russia at the beginning of
the World War to remain there con
tinuously for seven years.
Triumphs at Metropolitan
Coming to America lie devoted
most of three months to concerts
and attained a sensational triumph
ai the Metropolitan Opera House
where, in 1921, he appeared as Tsar
Boris in Moussorgsky's "Boris God
unoff," for the first time in America.
The following season he made his
first coast-to-coast American con
cert tour, meeting everywhere with
success, and repeating his New
York triumph. Another event of his
season was an engagement with the
Chicago Opeta Company. The illus
trious artisl was as enthusiastically
acclaimed there as he had been in
the larger city.
"Beloved Singer"
Since then Chaliapin's tours have
been an annual feature of America's
mu.sical season, and he is so well
known throughout America that he
is often referred to as "America's
beloved singer." His success has been
outstanding everywhere, and his art
is the expression of a great person
ality.
