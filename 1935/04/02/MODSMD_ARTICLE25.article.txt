SACKAMENTO, April 1 (/P).â€”Re
turning its verdict after nearly three
days of deliberation, a Superior
Court jury today found eight Sac
ramento Communists guilty of "con
spiracy to violate the criminal syn
dicalism act." Probation was recom
mended for two of those convicted.
Six of the 14 defendants in the
four months' long trial were freed.
Not one of the defendants was
found guilty of actual violation of
the criminal syndicalism law.
Defense Attorney Leo Gallagher
immediately rose with a motion for
a new trial, and Superior Judge Dal
M. Lemmon set Thursday for a hear
ing on the request.
Gallagher, who must appear to
morrow to answer a contempt of
court citation issued earlier in the
trial, asked that this action be post
poned until after the new trial heal
ing, but Judge Lemmon refused.
Those convicted on the count of
conspiracy face a pri. on term of
from t to 14 years.
