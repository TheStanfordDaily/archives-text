# COUNCIL MEETS TO STRAIGHTEN DRAMA TANGLE
## Full Powers to Select Own Productions Demanded By Dramatic Group CONCILIATION FAILURE Director Timmons' Choice Of Play Is Out 
### Irvin Jorgensen 
At this late date there is no Dra
| matic Council play selected for this
quarter. Many have bedn called, but
none chosen.
There was a time within the
memory of man that a play was
tentatively chosen by Dramatic Di
rector William Murray Timmons.
Eleanor Harris had written it. Di
rector Timmons had cast it, hut
Dramatic Council east it—out The
Council would have none o.f it.
Nothing would do but ihe Council
must have full power to choose its
own play.
Since that time, the Council has
I been exerting its full power. On the
i days of March 15, 16, and 18—just
before finals—Dramatic Council de
bated for three meetings totaling five
and a half hours in all upon various
things: the Harris play, other plays,
and Dramatic Manager Dick Frank.
The day of our Lord April 2 finds
i no decision reached. The Council
; is meeting this afternoon and per
haps the lamb will lie down with
i the lion and the dove of peace will
| hover over the Old Union com
mittee room, and then again may
be not.
First public notice of anything ex
traordinary in the tangled affairs of
the Dramatic Council appeared at
Ex Committee's Inst official meeting
of winter quarter, when Dramatic
Manager Dick Frank appeared and
stated that affairs were so bad that
no business could be done, and that
he, in conjunction with Director
I Timmons and all right-thinking citi
zens, desired the ten battling mem
bers reduced to five.
Ex Committee was touched to the
heart and was all for performing the
ceremony at that time, but golden
tongued Bill Rogers held out for the
hearing of the other side of the ques
tion.
In order to expedite the matter,
which Frank pressed as urgent, Ex
Committee held one of its extraordi
nary sessions on the following
Thursday to which the members who
were threatened with a toss of fran
chise were called.
Five stalwarts appeared: Jean Al
bertson, Masquers' representative;,
Jim Benet of Sword and Sandals,
Gordon Heche of Ram's Head, Bob
Ransom, member-at-large; and Gor
don Steedman, Chaparral represen
tative.
All but Steedman protested that
the enlarged Dramatic Council was
necessary to secure proper repre
sentation and that it did not inter
fere with business.
Timmons Calm
When questioned, even Director
Timmons said: "Everything has been
amicable and convenient for doing
business."
Said Student Manager Ben Cave:
"I won't play with these politics."
As the meeting broke up, Dramatic-
Manager Frank was seen to be out
on a limb holding a large-size sack.
Before many nights had passed
Steedman had resigned and Dick
Dawson took his place in the ranks.
Next came the three meetings. At
the first one on Friday, Eleanor Har
ris' play, which Director Timmons
had been so enthusiastically casting
that afternoon, was voted down.
At the second on Saturday, the
Council argued through the noon
•hour and into the afternoon that
Frank, who is secretary, should state
that a motion "requiring all business
pertaining to the Dramatic Council
should be brought before the Coun
cil first" was passed unanimously.
Frank claimed that the motion was
not passed unanimously because both
he and Cave had not voted.
"Yellow Jack" Voted
At the meeting on Monday, the
Dramatic Council considered four or
five plays, finally hit on "Yellow
Jack," a New York production. But
this was later ruled out because it
was financially infeasible.
This is the status of affairs to date.
"Everything is amicable and con
venient for doing business," but no
play has been chosen. The tentative
cast which Timmons selected for the
Harris play probably will not fit any
play that the Council chooses, if they
choose it.
Frank is still doing business on the
same old limb, but he is no longer
lonesome for company.
If no play is chosen by the middle
of the quarter, the vari-colored
handbills may announce as the

spring production: "A Dramatic
Councii Meeting, a farce in three acts
with an ALL-STAR cast —at a great
reduction in prices."
