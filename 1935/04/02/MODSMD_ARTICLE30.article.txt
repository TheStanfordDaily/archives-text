on the Farm. While Stanford students swel
tered in the spring heal of Carmcl, cursed the
Los Angeles weather, or caught up on a quar
ter's lost sleep, campus debaters continued
their assaults on the highest forensic honors
to he achieved in college circles.
Most sterling of all achievements was the
victory in the .JofTre Medaille debate again by
Stanford speakers who gained the liist two
places. Before a very small but appreciative
audience in a drafty assembly hall, Marshall
Dill, brilliant Cardinal debater, achieved the
unusual when he won first place laurels in his
sophomore year of competition. David Mel
linkolf took a second place to give the Stanford
orators the great bulk of honors in this estab
lished debating classic.
Then in an after-dinner contest in Walla
Walla, Bill Hogers, polo-playing K\ Committee
member, proved that the i uesdav evening
committee meetings must provide a good
background for oratorical talent when he cap
lured this verbid lilt from I lit* assembled col
legians. With a topic entitled "Tlu Obligation
to Ise Knlertaining," Rogers proved that hu
mor in debating is the most ell'cclive of all
methods.

traveled widely ail over the United Stales, up
holding affirmatives and negatives to more
questions than could possibly be settled in the
ne\t ten years, but at the same lime winning
a majority of the victories, and bringing the
name of the western University before thou
sands of people. The elfecl is obvious. Not
only by track and football championship
teams, but also by intellectual and academic
honors does Stanford extend her prestige.
