# The 						Case of Public Ownership
## 
### 
The great American hullabaloo is again to ]
I ho forefront. This time it is on I lie subject of :
Iho proposed Public I'tilities Act, which is he- j
lore the Congress of the tinted States.
From their palatial suite in the Mavllowor 1
Hotel in Washington, D.C., the hi business'
ulflity heads of the country s'Â»l hack and send
out their propaganda. To say that thev arc 1
alarmed is not to say the half of it. Thov are I
closer to the stage of being paniekv. There is !
. 1
a substantial, well-grounded reason for their!
alarm.
There are two very respectable sides to lliis
problem, which has resoiven itself into a (pies
lion of abolishing holding companies with l
their central management and allowing gov
ernmental agencies lo take over these public |
utility operating companies, or to defeat the ,
Flililies Act and allow holding companies to
grow Mill stronger.
The bill itself is largely concerned with (dec- j
trie rales, and it would supposedly put into the
hands of the Federal Pow'er Commission con
trol over 91 per cent of the national output of
elect rieilv.
The bij; slvots of the public utility companies ;
stale that they do not oppose "fair regulation." j
Kill who is to determine just what fair rcgula- j
lion means? (ioverninent proponents of the '
bill before Congress maintain that the com
panies are in such a position that they can con
trol rales to an excessive degree, and that they
must be stripped of some of llieir pow'er.
On the other hand, the men who arc lobby-:
ing so vigorously tor the defeat of the proposed
bill stale that their cause is the right one, and !
that government control means federal bu
reaucracy lo an unlimited degree. What is
more, there are strong points 011 the side of j
Ibis opposition. They are nol only fighting for j
the survival of their holding and operating J
companies, but against what they term "nulli
fying the private initiative and independent
management upon which American industry !
is based."
The trend seems to be toward more govern
mental ownership and regulation of the great ,
public services than ever before. Private in
itiative seems destined to retreat before Ihe ;
advances ol a socialization of the ureal imlus
trrr*, am I w htm h+ tiding an+f- opera! in-g com- |
panics stand in the path of government ad
vance, there is no longer much they can do lo
prevent absorption.
So the once all-powerful public utility, and
holding company with its control in a few
skilled hands, recoils before Ihe idea of public |
monopoly. II speaks of ils millions of inves-j
tors in public utility securities, and the ruin-]

ous effects of eliminating the holding compa
nies, upon the savings of these people.
1 lit* hattle will probably rage for some time
to come, with the remnants of what was once
the very pillar of the capitalist class continu- !
i llj-i to send out their sincere and siahhorn re
sistance. The main trouble is that the psy- !
chologv is had. In 11Kb"), were ihe executives
and directors of the public utilities to send out
their propaganda to disgusted business men
Irom some neighboring street corner, results |
might be effectual, but s<i long as they appeal
to the electorate from alar, with their head- j
quarters for lobbying a swanky hotel, it ap
pears as if the proposed act wiil pass Congress
and go into effect.
