# Getting Mail at the Post Office
## 
### 
Now painted and shiny inside, the old stone
post olliee on Lasuen is being spruced up for
spring, (lone from the walls are seribblings I
of playful frosh. (lone are the other vestiges
of playful pranksters. With the disappearance
of these "old memories" comes a warning
from the postmaster that 110 more high-school '
antics will b'e tolerated in the building.
Hun by the government, the post olliee is a
federal enterprise and thus outside Ihe .juris
diction of the t'niversity administration. The
penally for disregarding the warning will be
the closing of the post.olliee at N o'clock every j
night. This possible ruling will mean the tak
ing away of any opportunity on the part of a
student \\ilh a post box to gel his mail much
after dark.
The prospect of not getting a few hoped-for I
letters until the next morning will probably
discourage any Hough who has a yen to dis
play his art works on the newly varnished
walls of the post olliee.
At the same time Ihe defacing of govern
ment properly and the jamming open of mail I
boxes are antics which foster serious and dras
tic consequences, distasteful to any playful
inclinations.
