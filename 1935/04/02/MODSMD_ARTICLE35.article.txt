## FREE SPEECH, FREE PRESS WITH PROFESSOR CATHCART 
### CEDRIC LARSON 
"The newspapers," Prince Metternich once ob
served, "are worth to Napoleon an army of three hun
dred thousand men, for such a force would not over
look the interior better, or frighten foreign Powers
more, than half a dozen of his paid pamphleteers."
The shrewd Austrian diplomat well knew the power
of the printed page when he made this statement more
than a century and a quarter ago, and today with
technical devices, communications and coverage vast
ly superior, the power of the press can scarcely be
over-emphasized.
Little wonder that freedom of the press is scarcely
more than the shadow of its former substance wheravcr
absolutism has arisen in post-war Europe. The British
Commonwealth, France and America remain the only
strongholds of freedom of expression, and even in
these countries it is on trial. The judicial status of free
dom of press and speech is now under fire in the state
of California as well as other states. Just what is its
constitutional basis?
Professor Arthur M. Cat heart of the Law School
believes the "free and untrammelled discussion of
public affairs" to be die "very keystone of Amer
ican liberty. Without it no democracy could pos
sibly function, for through it alone may the peo
ple express their thoughts and desires." Constitu
tional provisions, both state and federal, protect in
dividuals from governmental interference only with
regard to freedom of press and speech.
Recently an eminent champion of an unpopular
cause was not able to find a suitable hall for ex
pressing his views in San Francisco. Some of his j
associates asserted that fconstitutional free speech had !
been violated. This was not true, for a hall owner j
may determine who shall talk from its platform, just ■
lis the owner of a newspaper may decide who shall
wine for its columns. If San Francisco had forbidden
him to speak anywhere in the city a very different !
question would have arisen.
Similar principles apply to academic freedom:
"What shall or shall not be taught in any pri
vately endowed college or university is entirely
discretionary with its management, subject only to
the primary requirements of public decency *vul
order." observes Professor Cathcart.
"The exercise of that discretion may and often
does involve difficult questions of social ethics
and educational theory; but the problem remains
in every instance purely a matter of internal policy.
Its solution has nothing whatever to do with con
stitutional free speech."
In other words, guarantees of freedom of press and J
speech under the American system are tantamount to j
restraints from governmental interference with per
sonal freedom, but do not require cither state or
federal governments to provide facilities for personal
publicity.
Freedom of the press or speech does not imply that 1
individuals ate constitutionally entitled to have their j
ideas printed yr disseminated at public expense, the
law professor states. Still deluded though well-inlen
tioned enthusiasts very often believe people are bound 1
to furnish them at public cost with a suitable place
to broadcast opinions. They choose perhaps the steps
of a public building, the lawn of a public park or
the sidewalk of a busy street. When they are noti
fied to "move on" they fancy their freedom is out
raged and the Constitution trod in the dust.
Public order and public safety are actually the
lOTtly points at issue, and as long as they are not
discriminated against in carrying out these safe
guards, constitutional rij'hts arc not infringed.

to furnish them at public cost with a suitable place
to broadcast opinions. They choose perhaps the steps
of a public building, the lawn of a public park or

Public order and public safety are actually the

"The newspapers," Prince Metternich once ob
served, "are worth to Napoleon an army of three hun
dred thousand men, for such a force would not over
look the interior better, or frighten foreign Powers
more, than half a dozen of his paid pamphleteers."
The shrewd Austrian diplomat well knew the power
of the printed page when he made this statement more
than a century and a quarter ago, and today with
technical devices, communications and coverage vast
ly superior, the power of the press can scarcely be
over-emphasized.
Little wonder that freedom of the press is scarcely
more than the shadow of its former substance wheravcr
absolutism has arisen in post-war Europe. The British
Commonwealth, France and America remain the only
strongholds of freedom of expression, and even in
these countries it is on trial. The judicial status of free
dom of press and speech is now under fire in the state
of California as well as other states. Just what is its
constitutional basis?
Professor Arthur M. Cat heart of the Law School
believes the "free and untrammelled discussion of
public affairs" to be die "very keystone of Amer
ican liberty. Without it no democracy could pos
sibly function, for through it alone may the peo
ple express their thoughts and desires." Constitu
tional provisions, both state and federal, protect in
dividuals from governmental interference only with
regard to freedom of press and speech.
Recently an eminent champion of an unpopular
cause was not able to find a suitable hall for ex
pressing his views in San Francisco. Some of his j
associates asserted that fconstitutional free speech had !
been violated. This was not true, for a hall owner j
may determine who shall talk from its platform, just ■
lis the owner of a newspaper may decide who shall
wine for its columns. If San Francisco had forbidden
him to speak anywhere in the city a very different !
question would have arisen.
Similar principles apply to academic freedom:
"What shall or shall not be taught in any pri
vately endowed college or university is entirely
discretionary with its management, subject only to
the primary requirements of public decency *vul
order." observes Professor Cathcart.
"The exercise of that discretion may and often
does involve difficult questions of social ethics
and educational theory; but the problem remains
in every instance purely a matter of internal policy.
Its solution has nothing whatever to do with con
stitutional free speech."
In other words, guarantees of freedom of press and J
speech under the American system are tantamount to j
restraints from governmental interference with per
sonal freedom, but do not require cither state or
federal governments to provide facilities for personal
publicity.
