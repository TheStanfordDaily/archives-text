### 
The Editor, Sir:
I have read many complaints late
ly of Ihe various ev'ils of life in
Encina. After living in this place
for two quarters I have concluded
that most of these grievances are
vastly over-stated.
Of course, a slight amount of pro
fanity and vulgarity is heard in the
corridors, the inmates often make
free with property not their own,
and the food bears a decided re
semblance to a marshy jnudflat on
a hot day. However, the&e items in
themselves are not objectionable.
They give the hall a certain col
legiate air which might otherwise be
lacking.
There is one thing, however,
which is a blot upon the fair name
of Stanford and should be remedied
at once. I refer to the varied fauna
of Encina. These animals range
from a profusion of insects and small
quadrupeds to a species of mammal
known as "Homo Sponsoris." Their
size and constant activity makes
them an ever present threat to the
peace of mind of the freshman.
The whole assortment is most in
convenient and distasteful to the
male members of the class of '38.
We would appreciate it greatly if
you would take this matter up with
cither Mr. MellinkofT, President
Wilbur, or the authorities of the
nearest zoo.
Sincerely yours,
J.C.S.
