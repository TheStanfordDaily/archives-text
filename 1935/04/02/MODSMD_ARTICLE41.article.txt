| "FOLIES BERGERE DE PARIS"
j At the Stanford Theatre
| Maurice Chevalier takes a dual
role as Charlier, star of the Folies,
and as Baron Cassini, boulevardier
1 and financier. The Baroness be
comes interested in Charlier's imi-

tation of hgr
husband and
when he is em
ployed to stave
off a financial
crisis during the
Baron's absence
a humorous,
farce-like situa-

tion develops, remindful of the plot
,ol ''The Guardsman." Ann Sothern,
; Charlier's jealous mistress, adds
i spice to the film with her temper
: and melod}' with her voice. The
jtwo extravagant numbers, "Rhythm
jin the Rain." and "The Straw Hat,"
, account for the title and give Che
valier a chance to shine. "Au Re
voir L'Amour" is another tvineful
number from the show.
