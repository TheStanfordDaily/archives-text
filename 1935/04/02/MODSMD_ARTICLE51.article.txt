## HUSKY WIN HITS CARD HOPES 
### 
The Seattle defeat came as a hard
blow to followers of Stanford track.
With California track booming, the
steady progress of the Bears through
four dual meets being apparent even
to those who tried not to see it,
the 68-63 loss to the Huskies as a
season's opener, indicated the worst.
But the Washington defeat is sure
to be the low point of the year, as
far as Stanford track is concerned.
Few of the Stanford squad of 18
even equalled their early season
performances. After they had tak
en a 16 to 2 lead at the close of the
first two events, the discus and the
shot, the Indians started to run into
trouble. Here are a few of the
things that happened in Seattle,
given not to explain WHY Stan
ford lost, but HOW they lost, if
you get the distinction.
