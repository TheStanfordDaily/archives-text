# SHARP CURVES BOTHERED INDIANS
## 
### 
For one, the Indian middle dis
tance men never did get the hang
of running the sharp curves of the
Armory oval, even though the ones
on the home Angell Field are sharp
enough. The Washington runners
slowed up a bit just before they hit
the curve, then put on the steam
when Ihey got into it, just like step
ping on the accelerator of a car
when rounding a curve. The In
dians missed the trick of slowing
up, and their momentum carried
them to the outside of the curves.
They say A1 Blackman almost ran
into the stands every time.
There's also a bit of explanation
why Arne Anderson and Teeny
Ginn only cleared 12 feet in the
Role vault, when they have been
doing 12 feet 6 inches consistently.
The light conditions were far from
desirable. The runway faced the
scoreboard, on which lights indi
cating the score were constantly be
ing flashed on and off.
Lighting which the Stanford
men were not used to also hin
dered the broadjuniping of
George Tharp. Thorp had difli
culty finding the board for his
take-offs, fouling seven out of his
eight jumps. The one good jump
gave him third place, but almost
any one of his "crowhops" would
have won.
Which is all meant to keep the
critics from nailing the coffin on
Stanford's 1935 track hopes, not yet,
anyway. The wraps should be off
this Saturday, however, with the
Fresno State meet on Angell Field.
