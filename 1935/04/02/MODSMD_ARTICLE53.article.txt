# LITTLE HEADS FOR BRITISH OPEN
## 
### 
Lawson Little, the Farm's golfing
light, packed his bags some ten days
ago and headed East to find Tommy
Armour and get some pointers on
his iron shots and then to cross
the pond and defend his British
Amateur open title.
Little is far from confident. He
realizes that his golf has been way
below par this winter, that he has
been ''number three man on the
school team instead of national
champion." But he'd rather "lose
the title gracefully," as he puts it
himself, than "dodge the tourna
ment."
But Bobby Jones, who remains
king of golf, even though re
tired from competition, thinks
Little is a great deal better golfer
than the Stanford divot-digger
indicates. On the same day Little
was looking forward to almost
certain loss of his title, Jones
wrote that Little was the best
amateur golfer in America last
year, that Little's winning of both
the British and American amateur
titles was the outstanding golfing
accomplishment in several years,
that the wins were no flukes.
