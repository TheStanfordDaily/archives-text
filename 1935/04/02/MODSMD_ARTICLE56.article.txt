# Coast Light-Heavyweight Crown Won by De Veuve
## 
### 
Stanford boxers, despite the fact
that only five Indians were entered,
succeeded, through the efforts of
Captain Sims De Veuve, in annexing
the light-heavyweight crown in the
Pacific Coast Intercollegiate Cham
pionships which were held in Sacra
mento on March 29 and 30.
The Indian boxers placed fifth in
team scoring with a total of ten
points in the thrilling tournament
which both nights packed Sacra
mento's War Memorial Auditorium
to its 8000 capacity. Washington
State College took team honors with
36 points; University of San Fran
cisco was second with 25; California
had 21; U.C.LA. had 13; Stanford
10; College of the Pacific 2; and the
California Aggies, defending cham
pions, nothing.
DeVcuvc Sensational
Captain DeVeuve proved the
sensation of the first night when he
decisioned 175-pound defending
champion Gil Borba of the Califor
nia Aggies in the most thrilling fight
of the evening. The third round
developed into an old-fashioned
slug-fest as both boys threw cau
tion to the winds and fought it out
toe-to-toe. DeVeuve's victory was
one of the upsets of the meet as
the Aggie champion was figured as
a cinch to repeat this year.
On the second night DeVeuve met
Stanley Shell of California for the
title. The flashy Card had no trou
ble in decisioning his less-experi
enced Bear rival. De Veuve scored a
clean decision by safe boxing and
did not try to slug it out with his
opponent.
Sullivan Scores Knockout
Bill Sullivan, in the lightweight
class, was the only other Stanford

I man to win a bout. Sullivan knocked
out John Pryor of the Cal Aggies
|in the second round after he had
tagged his man twice in the first
stanza for knockdowns. Advanc
ing to the semi-finals on the second
I night, however, Sullivan lost a close
decision to George Thurston of
i California who ultimately won the
j title in this weight. After being
floored in the first round Sullivan
I staged a beautiful comeback to more
j than hold his own in the remaining
| periods.
In the 125 - pound class Dick
; Winzler lost a very close decision
ito Californian Hilton Taylor in a
j very unpopular decision. The crowd,
which was pulling for the Card
battler, loudly registered their dis
approval when the nod went to
I Taylor. Winzler put up a great bat
! tie.
Velarde Loses Battle
A1 Velarde had the misfortune to
| encounter Roy Petregalla of Wash
] ington State who later won the
I featherweight crown in his bout,
j Velarde wasn't good enough for the
i Washingtonian and he lost by a
knockout in the first round after be
ing in bad shape the whole time.
The other Stanford boxer, Barney
| Greenlee, had to fight California's
giant captain, Jim Castle. Greenlee,
though a light-heavy, was forced
into the heavyweight division when
DeVeuve moved up into the the
175-pound class. As a result the
I game Indian was no match for the
j defending heavyweight champion
j and was K.O.'ed in the second round.

i Senior dues are now payable at
the A.S.S.U. office. The amount is
J two dollars.

toe-to-toe. DeVeuve's victory was
one of the upsets of the meet as
the Aggie champion was figured as
a cinch to repeat this year.
On the second night DeVeuve met
Stanley Shell of California for the
title. The flashy Card had no trou
ble in decisioning his less-experi
enced Bear rival. De Veuve scored a
clean decision by safe boxing and
did not try to slug it out with his
opponent.
Sullivan Scores Knockout

stanza for knockdowns. Advanc
ing to the semi-finals on the second
I night, however, Sullivan lost a close
decision to George Thurston of
i California who ultimately won the
j title in this weight. After being

I staged a beautiful comeback to more
j than hold his own in the remaining
| periods.
In the 125 - pound class Dick
; Winzler lost a very close decision
ito Californian Hilton Taylor in a

I Taylor. Winzler put up a great bat
! tie.
Velarde Loses Battle
