# INDIAN SWIMMERS PLACE SECOND IN P.C. CONFERENCE
## Cardinals Upset Dope, Best U.C. by One Point 
### 
Upsetting the dopesters* predic
tions, Coach Nort Thornton's Indian
swim squad did the unexpected and
downed the strong California mer
men to place second to U.S.C. in the
Pacific Coast Intercollegiate con
ference held in Los Angeles last
week.
A single point placed Stanford
ahead of the Bears in the final tally.
U.S.C. won the meet with a score
of 35, the Cards garnered 31 points,
California had 30, and U.C.L.A. was
crediled with 18. Since 1917 it was
the first Pacific Coast conference
title that the Indians failed to win.
Their rating on the dope sheet had
sunk, for the first time in 18 years,
from winner to a probable third
place.
But the actual events netted the
Cards a more gratifying result.
With only two first places in the
individual events, Stanford was able
to defeat U.C. and rank only four
points behind the victorious Trojans.
