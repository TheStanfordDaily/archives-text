# Assembly for Peace Planned

### 
Biggest threat to Stanford peace
at the present time is the proposed
Stanford peace assembly.
Backed by the local chapter of
the League for Industrial Democ
lacy, the English Club, the Y.W.C.A.,
and the History Club, the peace as
sembly has been suggested for Fri
day morning, April 12, at 11 o'clock.
By a not-so-odd coincidence, the
nation-wide peace strike has been
called for the same day. That Stan
ford does not want to be connected
with the nation-wide strike is the
firm conviction of the administration.
When Ex Committee learned of
this attitude it voted to do nothing
about it to the score of 6-5, though
it had previously appointed Presi
dent Marvie Kahn a committee of
one to interview the administration
upon the subject.
