# Card Trackmen Barely Lose to Huskies, 68-63
## 
### 
Stanford's 1935 track team lost a
nip-and-tuck meet not decided until
the relay and the season s opener
when they lost to Hec Edmundson s j
University of Washington Huskies by ]
a score of 08 to 03 last Friday night !
in Seattle.
The two other meets scheduled, the |
Aij-University invitational and the
Sun Francisco University dual, were
postponed because ol inclement !
weather. Next Saturday the Indians j
will make their initial home appear- ;
ance against the strong Fresno State
squad.
Performances Mediocre
Apparently the long train ride and
the sharp turns of the Armory con
siderably hampered the Stanford
men in the Seattle meet. With the i
exception of Sammy Klopstock s j
marks in the hurdles all the times
and distances were inferior to those |
made earlier in the year.
The outstanding performance of ;
the meet from the standpoint of j
thrills and an exhibition of competi- j
tive running was Captain A1 Black- |
man's anchor lap in the relay. Black
man took the baton some 20 yards
behind sophomore Jimmy Angle who
had previously won the mile and
who seemed to have a safe lead.
A1 Just Misses
Running for the victory which the
win would give his team Blackman
whipped about the 220-yard oval
with the speed of a sprinter and
steadily cut down the Washington
lead. Coming off the last turn he
was right on Angle's shoulder, but
the Washington runner uncorked the '
sprint he had been saving and held |
a two-yard lead at the tape.
Besides the running of Blackman,
who also won the 440-yard dash, and
Klopstock, who took second in the
75-yard dash and won both hurdles,
leading Stanford performances were
made by Johnny Mottram, with a
winning throw in the javelin of 210
feet, five feet over the Armory rec
ord; Jim Reynolds, with a put of 49
feet 8 inches for lirst in the shot; Tom
Sales, second in the javelin at 198
feet; and Humbert Smith's winning
high jump of 0 feet 4*4 inches.
