# Fastest 2-Mile on Coast Run by Indian Ineligible
## 
### 
Norm Bright, Stanford ineligible,
ran the fastest 2-mile on the Coast
this year when he completed the
eight laps in 9 minutes, 22 seconds,
17 under the present Big Meet rec
ord.
Though running alone and with
little regular practice behind him,
Bright showed the same speed and
endurance which has made him a
valuable distance man for the Olym
pic Club the past two seasons. He
will run Saturday in the I.C. 4-A.
benefit meet at Angell Field.
