# Heinrich Uses Geometry For Lamson Testimony
## 
### 
SAN JOSE, April 1 The
geometrical situtation resulting from
the intersectiton of two planes at
right angles—to be specific, the two
walls of the Lamson bathroom —
formed the basis for expert testi
mony given today by E. O. Hein
rich, Berkeley criminologist, at the
trial for murder of David A. Lam
son.
From the blood marks on the
Lamson bathroom walls Heinrich
declared it was possible to calculate
where Mrs. Allene Lamson's head
lay when arterial spurts from her
split head stained the walls. He
pointed out the presqnee of the two
planes made it possible to check the
blood stains on them to determine
the level of the blood's point of ori
gin.
