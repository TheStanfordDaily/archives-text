# Yearling Track Hopes Still High Despite Defeats
## 
### 
Two defeats garnered during the
spring holidays are not dampening
the spirits of the Stanford frosh track
team's genial coach, Bill Ellington, as
he sizes up the chances for his men
to take a victory over the San Fran
cisco All-Stars next Saturday.
Ellington believes his Card frosh
will be able to handle their all-star
opponents in easy style, although he
admitted that his confidence was
somewhat based on the fact that the
San Francisco squad is weakened by
the loss of Bob McGuire, stellar
sprinter. McGuire, who does the
hundred in 9.7, pulled a muscle last
Saturday and will be off the track
for some time.

Looking back at the performance
of his squad against Sacramento J.C.
last Saturday, Ellington regretted the
71-51 defeat but seemed positive that
bad luck was largely responsible for
the loss. Bill explained that had di
minutive sprinter Guy Hagerty not
been taken ill with an appendicitis
attack late Friday evening before the
meet, Stanford's places- in the 440
and relay the following day would
have been bettered sufficiently to put
the Indians on the long end of the
score.
Cy Oberg, who took a first in the
low hurdles last week with a time of
25.6 and who tied for second in the
highs, is a "darn sweet hurdler" ac
cording to Bill, and if his rapid im
provement continues "will be doing
under 25." Etson Burroughs' 880 vic
tory and second in the mile proved
his worth on the two and four lap
runs.
Two-Milcr Good
John Dern, regular two-miler, ran
even with Burroughs throughout the
mile and was first to break the tape
at that event when Burroughs
stepped behind at the finish. Elling
ton was pleased with the showing
made by Jim Coonan, who ran "a
beautiful second lap of the relay."
Grant Stone's javelin throw of 178
feet and Hank Luisetti's high jump
of 6 feet % inch gave indication that
these men will be leading their re
spective fields before long.
