## 
### 
Steedman's tractable and attrac
tive stooges have spent their whole j
week of sprung vacation racing up ;
and down the sunny highways of i
the concrete State of California in
front of the dogs of the law get- j
ting experience for turning out copy s
for Chappie's "Spring Track Num- ;
bcr."
"The deadline for thus issue was j
yesterday," says Steedman. "Get j
your copy in early."
So a copious amount of copy has j
been pouring into the Chappie office, j
mixed with traffic tickets, old 1
clothes, corkscrews, two vaulting j
poles, 220 low girdles, and Steed- 1
man.
One particularly delightful con- J
tiibution to the collection is a mural j
painted by Feg Murray, '1(5, of the
snopy-quops, or the quifflewhips, or |
the quopplewhopples at play.
Murray is a former Chappie man,
an Olympic track star, and Stan- j
ford gentleman, now a columnist of
Hollywood doings which he calls j
"Seein' Stars."
"It is a phantasmagorical and al
legorical pictorial of nocturnal hal- j
lucinations," says Steedman. Gor- >
don Steedman is editor of "Chap- I
arral."
