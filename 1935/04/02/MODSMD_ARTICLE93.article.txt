# COURT SETS ASIDE TWO VERDICTS IN SCOTTSBORO CASE
## Retrial Ordered in One Case; Other Returned 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 1 (/P).— I The
Supreme Court today set aside the
death imposed on Clar
ence Noj'iis and Haywood Patterson,
negroes eonvicted of assaulting a
white woman near Scottsboro, Ala.,
and returned both cases to Alabama
courts for further action.
Tii the case of Norris, Chief Jus
tice Hughes' opinion directly or
dered a new trial »fter saying
there was no controversy about the
constitutional principle involved—
that if negroes are excluded from
jury service, equal protection of
the laws to all does not result.
In a separate opinion on Patter
sou, Hughes returned the case for
the Alabama courts to decide wheth
er he should not be given a new
trial.
While court attaches explained
the Alabama court could refuse a
new trial and resentence Patter
son, they contended in this event
he could return to the Supreme
Court for a direct order for a new
trial.
The reason for not ordering a new
trial for Patterson immediately wa.s
said to be technical. Lawyers who
heard the opinion held that should
a new trial be refused him by Ala
bama courts, the high court un
doubtedly would order one.
