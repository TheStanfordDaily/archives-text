# Huey Says Roosevelt May Lead New Party
## 
### 
WASHINGTON. April 1 (/P).—
Huey Long stirred up much talk of
third party possibilities today, but
with almost everyone convinced he
had overshot the mark with a pre
diction that next year would see one
led by President Roosevelt himself.
Ilis implied threat that he or
some other "share-the-wealth"
leader would succeed in winning
the Democratic nomination left
party leaders unperturbed, but re
luctant to emphasize his forecast
by a discussion of it.
It was generally regarded as a
foregone conclusion that the Admin
istration would have a two-thirds
majority of the ' delegates safely
lined up when the convention meets.
May Split South
Party leaders, nevertheless, are
watching closely for any definite
signs of a third party movement. It
has been suggested in several quar
ters that one led by Long might
have the possibly serious effect of
jating into the president's Southern
and Midwestern support.
Long «ncl Charles E. Coughlin,
radio priest, are generally felt to
understand each other, even if they
do not have a definite agreement

F as to 19.1(5. Milo Reno, of the re
cent "farm holiday" movement
lias invited them and Governor Ol
son of Minnesota to meet at an
early dale.
Inquiries at Long's office revealed
that hp had accepted the Reno in
vitation, but there was some con-:
fusion as to whether Coughlin plan
ned to attend. The meeting is to be
held at Des Moines on May 7.
Kingfish Blasts
The Kin§fish threw his latest blast
at the Administration today, storm
ing up and down the President's
room adjacent to the Senate cham
ber. He was asked about last night's
third-party reference.
"We may not have to form a third
party," he said. "Roosevelt may be
leading a third party. He's already
i started a couple of third parties. He
began to organize one iiy ( l932 when
ihe thought he might not get the
Democratic nomination, and he or
ganized one in 1933, when he ran
this fellow McK.ee against La Guar
dia.
"TliTs ain't a Democratic party
running the government now. It's
a St. Vitus d:>nce parly designated
by a blue buzzard, and a dead one,
I at that."

WASHINGTON. April 1 (/P).—
Huey Long stirred up much talk of
third party possibilities today, but
with almost everyone convinced he
had overshot the mark with a pre
diction that next year would see one
led by President Roosevelt himself.
Ilis implied threat that he or
some other "share-the-wealth"
leader would succeed in winning
the Democratic nomination left
party leaders unperturbed, but re
luctant to emphasize his forecast
by a discussion of it.
It was generally regarded as a
foregone conclusion that the Admin
istration would have a two-thirds
majority of the ' delegates safely
lined up when the convention meets.

Party leaders, nevertheless, are
watching closely for any definite
signs of a third party movement. It
has been suggested in several quar

have the possibly serious effect of
jating into the president's Southern
and Midwestern support.

radio priest, are generally felt to
understand each other, even if they
do not have a definite agreement
