The Convalescent Home Drive
with it;; attendant Bean Day, Labor
Day, the Masque Ball, and the King
and Queen contest put on by the
Rally Committee takes the center
spot of the spring quarter activities
calendar.

Appropriate More Money
Ex Committee held a short meet
ing, but by the time it had finished
it had appropriated a sum "around
$00" for a new high-velocity micro
phone for the A.S.S.U. public ad
dress system, and $31.50 for a page
in the Quad for the Stanford Cardi
nals; had discussed the Dramatic
Council minutes, the New Theatre,
the peace assembly, A.S.S.U. copies
of the Quad, and the prospect for a
smaller A.S.S.U. profit than bud
geted, and granted dytes.
• New Address System
The P.A. system, which last year's
Ex Committee bought, has already
cost the A.S.S.U. $800, but the com
mittee decided that it might as well
attempt to perfect the new system
as long as so much money has al
ready been "sunk"' in the outfit.
The new microphone was tried out
at Tuesday's Registration Dance
and was reported by observers to
make the system superior to any
competing systems, according to
Student Manager Ben Cave.
Bill Stark opposed the expendi
ture. He said: "It is not the depre
ciation but the obsolescence that I
object to."
