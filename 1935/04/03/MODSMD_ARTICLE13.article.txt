# End Debate Team Tours
## Over Fifty Colleges Visited On Forensic Trip 
### 
Concluding Stanford's complete j
coverage of the country in forensic j
activities, three varsity debaters, |
Bob Gros, Dave Mellinkoff, and Bill 1
Rogers will return today at noon I
after debating in the Northwest dur- I
ing the past week.
The bulk of Stanford's coverage
was taken care of by the two Trans
continental teams composed of Fred
Bold and Andrew Bright, and Bob
Grant ier and Packey McFarland.
Bold and Bright, accompanied by
McFarland, left the campus on Jan
uary 30, meeting University of Ne- ;
vada at Reno in their first tilt.
McFarland left the first team at
Chicago and went ahead to New
York to meet Grantier and then
cover the Northeast and the Atlantic
seaboard. Bold and Bright, after
covering the Rockies, Middle West,
and Atlantic, toured the South, and
wound up their trip by debating
Georgia, Alabama, Louisiana State,
Arizona, and Texas.
Approximately 70 debates with 50
schools were participated in by
the Stanford men in the transcon
tinental tour, and every one of the
audience decision debates was a
Stanford victory.
