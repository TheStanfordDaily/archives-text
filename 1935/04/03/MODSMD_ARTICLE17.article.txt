# Scientific Spring Proves Too Dull for Collegians
## 
### ROBERT EISENBACH 
Bcirded scientists the world over looked up from a mass of slide
rules and graph paper March 21 and solemnly announced the arrival
of the vernal equinox. To them it represents an exact division of ter
! rcstrial time, and they've tacked a name on it enough to scare any
| Phi Bete.
To the rest of the world, Stanford included, it's known by the name of
! Spring. Rough and co-ed nriintain that spring is the period when you

j don'l. bother about such scientific
things as vernal equinoxes. A** a
matter of fact, you don't bother
about anything save food, sleep, and
| romance.
It's long Olympic for the cook,
1 Morpheus, and Dan Cupid, and it's
| got more recommendations to the
college student than you can shake
a stick at. It's the one season when
you don't have to cudgel your poor
j tired brain for an excuse not to
; study. Keep your high purpose of
reading that awful text book, but
! just take it with you onto some
j sunny green hillside and see what
happens.
Interesting, too, the way that girl
who sat next to you all last quarter
suddenly takes on a new look, and
makes you wonder what the dickens
you were so cool fur.
Movies, too, seem to be more in
; the "must see" classification than
j formerly. Palo Alto theatres are al
most as crowded as they were dur
! ing finals week â€”in short, plenty
full.
Take the two co-eds pictured
I above, trying to find out "what that

| old goof who wrote this book" is j
j talking about. Looks tn me like
| they're about to fall right ofT. We'll
bet a cooky they're not talking
about what they're supposed to.
It's about some gorgeous "he," or
i what they did last night, or all the
work they oughta be doing but will
do tonight.
Spring is . . . that is, spring. . . .
