# Rumors Say Nazis Plan Memel Raid
## Polish Swing from German Influence Seen After British Parley 
### 
WARSAW, April 2 (/P). â€”Rumors
of a Nazi coup to absorb Memel went
hand in hand today with reports of a
Lithuanian request to the League of
Nations for sovereignty over that
disputed territory.
The Swiss government formally
protested to Berlin over alleged ab
duction of a German newspaper
man who had sought refuge in Swit
zerland, while a Polish swing away
from the sphere of German influ
ence was presaged tonight after the
first day of Anglo-Polish conversa
tions.
Report Pact Modified
In a four-hour conference with
Polish statesmen Captain Anthony
Eden, Britain's roving negotiator,
l-eportedly made progress toward
modification of the French - spon
sored Eastern security pact, which
Warsaw and Berlin heretofore have
rejected.
The seeming change in Poland's
foreign policy was further empha
sized in the Foreign Office's an
nouncement that Pierre Laval,
French Foreign Minister, would be
invited to visit Warsaw in connec
tion with his trip to Moscow late
this month.
Suspect German Coup
Suspicion that Germany is plan
ning a coup to absorb Memel before
the powers can unite is an eastern
security pact was expressed today in
the semiofficial Communist organ,
the Moscow Pravda. The newspa
per cited alleged agitation in various
parts of Germany for the furtherance
of that purpose.
Revealing Lithuania's plan to ap
peal to the League of Nations over
Memel, the Riga correspondent of
the Exchange Telegraph Company
today sent ihe following report:
Will Ask League
Relying on support, from France
and Russia, the Lithuanian govern
ment has decided to ask the League
of Nations for unconditional recog
nition of Lithuania's sovereignty
over Memel and abolition of the
present statute under which Memel
territory is administered by a High
Commissioner representing the
League.
