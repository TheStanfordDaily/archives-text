# Scholarship Is '35 Class Gift
## 
### 
â€¢ A scholarship fund will again this
year take the place of a bench,
drinking fountain, or other material
gift formerly presented to the Uni
versity by the senior class, accord
ing to Gordon Mallatratt, chairman
of the Class of 1935 endowment com
mittee.
The fund will be administered by
the president of the Board of Trust
ees, and will be used to pay the tui
tion of some needy student. Money
will be obtained by voluntary
pledges from the members of the
class, who will sign subscription
blanks budgeting a certain sum to
be paid to the fund each year.
Previous classes have pledged an
average of $400 each, according to
Mallatratt. Present seniors will be
solicited for their pledges later this
quarter, he said.
