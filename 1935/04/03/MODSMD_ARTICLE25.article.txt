# Stuart Tells Of Foreign Crisis
## 
### 
Although the situation today re- |
sembles greatly that of 1914, and \
European nations are even more I
heavily anned than at that time, Dr. |
Graham Stuart of the political sci- j
ence department stated last night
that fear of revolution will be a '
strong factor in preventing war in !
Europe in the immediate future. J
Giving his "Personal Observations
on Present-Day Europe," Dr. Stuart
said that European dictators appre
ciate the fact that war is nearly al
ways followed by change of political
regime and are in no hurry to rush
into a conflict that may bring their 1
own downfall.
Summarizing the political and eco
nomic situation in the various Eu
-1 opean countries, Dr. Stuart des
cribed Europe as "living danger
ously." The murder of Dolfuss, the
"blood purge" in Germany, the as
sassination of King Alexander, the
Saar plebiscite have all been dan
gerou and alarming crises of the
past year. The bright spots in the
picture, Dr. Stuart thinks, were the
efficient handling of the last two
situationsâ€”the murder of Alexander
and the Saar plebiscite, and the re
crudescence of the League of Na
tions, beginning with the entrance
of Russia.
As far as the United States is
concerned, Stuart believes that it
will be very difficult for this coun
try to stay out of any European war
j and that, therefore, it is to our own
[advantage to co-operate in every
! way possible with the nations abroad
| to prevent such a war.
