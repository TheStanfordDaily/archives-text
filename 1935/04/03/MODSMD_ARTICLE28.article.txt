# Drama Council Advises End Of Student Control
## Yellow Jack' Approved As Spring Quarter Play At Meeting FINANCES WATCHED Administration as Function Of University Urged 
### 
Smarting under yesterday's Daily
chastisement, the Dramatic Council,
after approving "Yeilow Jack" as
spring quarter play, passed the
bombshell resolution that "Dra
matics administration, financially
and executively, is a function of the
University rather than of the stu
dents." This paves the way toward
a complete Stanford School of the
Theatre, controlled by the adminis
tration rather than by the students.
Director William Murray Tim
mons, speaking for the Council as
a whole, staled that "under 110 oth
er method would an outstanding
school of drama be possible in the
future. Financial administration
and responsibility should be a de
partmental project and not a mat
ter for student control."
This drastic statement wa.s the re
sult of a year of wrangling between
student financial heads and those
members of the council interested
primarily in the liteiary value of
dramatic productions.
Points Way for Change
The momentous decision was
reached after a three-hour attempt
to pare the budget so that the pre
sentation of "Yellow Jack" would
be financially possible. Members
of the Council expressed their sat
isfaction with the sincerity of effort
of the group and of Dramatic Man
ager Dick Frank, but feel that more
satisfactory results will be reached
by complete severance of dramatics
from .student control.
According to James Benct the res
olution does not mean that imme
diate change will take place, but
expresses the opinion of those most,
interested in dramatics, and points
the way for much-needed future
change.
Virgil Anderson, representative of
the English department who recently
completed a study of the dramatic:
set-up in 29 major colleges, found
that in a majority of these, control
of dramatics was in the hands of the
faculty. "Stanford's method of stu
dent control is decidedly in the mi
nority," he said.
The choice of "Yellow Jack," by
Sidney Howard, was made only after
a four to four deadlock, broken by
ihe casting of a deciding fifth vote
Iby telephone. Four members held
out to the lasl for the presentation
of Eleanor Harris' original three-act
play, "Cuckoo's Nest.'"
Based on the dramatic "Walter
Reed' chapter of Paul de Kruif's
"Microbe Huntters," the play chosen
is a contemporary classic dealing
with man's struggle against, and vic
tory over, the dread yeilow fever.
Most of the action takes place in an
American army camp in Cuba,
where Doctor Walter Reed and a
group of heroic assistants finally
learn the secret of the heretofore
fatal disease.
Present at the meeting were Di
rector Timrnons, George Andreini,
James Benet, Henry Brill, Jean Al
bertson, Dick Dawson, Dick Frank,
Gordon Heche, and Virgil Anderson.
