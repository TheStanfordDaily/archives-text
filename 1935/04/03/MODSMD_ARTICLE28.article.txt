# Drama Council Advises End Of Student Control
## Yellow Jack' Approved As Spring Quarter Play At Meeting FINANCES WATCHED Administration as Function Of University Urged 
### 
Smarting under yesterday's Daily
chastisement, the Dramatic Council,
after approving "Yeilow Jack" as
spring quarter play, passed the
bombshell resolution that "Dra
matics administration, financially
and executively, is a function of the

diate change will take place, but
expresses the opinion of those most,
interested in dramatics, and points
the way for much-needed future
change.
Virgil Anderson, representative of
the English department who recently
completed a study of the dramatic:
set-up in 29 major colleges, found
that in a majority of these, control
of dramatics was in the hands of the
faculty. "Stanford's method of stu
dent control is decidedly in the mi
nority," he said.
The choice of "Yellow Jack," by
Sidney Howard, was made only after
a four to four deadlock, broken by
ihe casting of a deciding fifth vote
