# The 						Dramatics Council Wishes to Retire
## 
### 
The inevitable litis finally happened. Al'ler
weeks of dispute and arguments that remind
one very much of a comic operetta, the Dra
matics Council in torrid session yesterday
finally came out with the startling resolution
that "the dramatics administration, finan
cially and executively, is a function of the Uni
versity rather than of the students."
Tactics employed by members of litis coun
cil last quarter were mindful of European
strategy at its best, or worst, as the ease may
be. 'I here were ten members on the council,
and each individual seemingly represented a
minority opinion of one. It was difficult to
obtain any unanimity of opinion even long
enough lo select a play for the quarter's pro
duction.
The resolution finally adopted yesterday
simply means that the Dramatics Council
wishes to abolish itself. There are two ways
to interpret its action. Either the Council far
secinglv realized the futility of it all, and
decided to end the wrangling attendant to
choosing suitable plays, or it "wished to in
dulge in the pleasant game of passing the
buck, and shifting responsibility to the admin
istration.
However, the council did finally select a play
to he produced, and at the same time made
clear that their resolution to shift control was
not to be a sudden change, but one that was
advisable. As Director Timmons put it, "finan
cial administration and responsibility should
be a departmental project and not a matter
for student control."
This is not entirely true. Responsibility in
the matter of choosing plays and in governing
dramatic affairs on thi* campus is not far re
moved from other self-administered student
activities. Student control is an integral part
of campus life, and it has proved itself suc
cessful in the great majority of problems con
fronting it. Should control of dramatics be
taken over by the department of the I'niversily
itself, it only means a weakening of student
participation, and an admission that they can
not handle the ir own all'aii s.
The three and a half hours of discussion
was interesting. Most surprising of all was
the fact that the existing council members
could agree long enough between themselves
to vole for I he* i r own future abolition, and it
is pleasing to note that the campus will see a
play litis quarter, alter all.
