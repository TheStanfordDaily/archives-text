Over at Berkeley where Ihev seem lo he
adept ill puiling surprises, conjuring innova
tions, and fostering (then combatting) radi
cals, the women are in Ihe midsl of ;i new
experiment. It's Leap Weak al California.
The eo-eds are cornering Ihe masculine ele
ment I his week and asking the men lor dales.
Sedale Slanfordites were lirsl aroused from
Iheir unmindful musings this year hv those
al Ihe stale institution hy the lied scare there,
then the most menacing and promising track
team, :md now a whole week of women's
conniving for dales among Ihe pick of Ihe
men.
II looks interesting.
This dating over ;it Berkeley for Ihe week
did not include treks to the city. Monday the
hrazen hussies were supposed to have coaxed
gullihle males to the campus soda fountain or
the corner drug store for ;i "coke." Yesterday
a lihe date was in order; today, the movies;
tomorrow, a special mixer dunce and oper
etta afterwards; and Friday, California Co-ed
Night for a dance at a local chili.
Detailed organization for the week has heen
worked out. Committee representatives have
heen selected in the sororities. Sunday the
results of all Ihe planning may he considered.
The Stanford Hough will probably he much
interested in what actually does happen. First
news of Ihe specially week appeals lo him; the
idea of not having to call up the girl friend
seems inviting. On second thought, however,
Ihe practical aspect what would actually
happen hits him and he sees himself either
finally paying for I lie movie, the coke, or the
dance when it comes lime lo pay, or else he
finds that his girl friend doesn't lake lo the
idea and Ihe whole "week" falls through.
Kven then, the Hough is optimist enough fo
look forward to encouraging news from Ber
keley.
