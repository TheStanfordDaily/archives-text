# Heart Balm on the Decline
## 
### 
When the New York legislature followed
thai of Indiana in passing one of I lie new
"anti heart halm" bills, American law took
another step forward toward thai t'topian
stale where law and justice may heroine syn
onymous terms.
The mere fart thai Sadie Snooks, peroxide
hlonde chorus girl, can no longer squee/e a
living out of suing hankers' sons in the ap
proved shorl-slorv style is not 100 significant.
The real ineril in the law is Ihe indicalion thai
even in these limes Ihcre is a serious move on
Ihe pari of legislators to think helore acting.
Many laws now existing are ridiculous, just
because sullicient thought did not go into their
preparation. One slate prohibits the shooting
of any animal except the whale from a moving
vehicle. Another law still on the books of an
Eastern slate prohibits the tarrying of lire
arms on a public highway "unless it be to
shoot a predatory animal or a police officer in
the discharge of his duly."
The smash and bang with which most legis
lation is pul through i*. the principal cause of
defects in Ihe finished product. One stale leg
islature alone has an average record of intro
ducing some hiils each session; and it is
of course imposible for even a small percent
age of these to be considered seriouslv.
