## AMERICAN PACIFIC EMPIREâ€”MEARS 
### CEDRIC LARSON 
While predictors view the future with all too san
guinary a gloom, occasionally a shaft of light pierces
the economic night of the black and muddled Thirties.
Such a ray of encouragement, at least to Califor
nians, and in varying degrees to other sections of the
Pacific slope, is offered by a working of Dr. Eliot
Grinnell Meats of the Graduate School of Business,
due shortly from the Stanford University Press, en
titled: "Maritime Trade of V/estern United States."
The volume brings together for the first time "the
salient features of the shipping activities of the Amer
ican Pacific empire."
"Ocean shipping, more than any other international
activity, is involved in propaganda," states Dr. Mears.
"Various governmental agencies are vitally concerned
in the maintenance and promotion of military and
naval interests, upon a national as well as a commer
cial basis." The investigator of maritime trade must
therefore winnow away a bushel of chaff to obtain
a handful of wheat. Trustworthy data are elusive.
The great mass of international trade such as
agricultural products, fuels, raw materials for in
dustry, and manufactures, is moved on water
rather than land, and nowhere is this more in evi
dence than on the Pacific Coast. On the West Coast
for the calendar year 1 930, 118,409,000 short tons of
cargo valued at live billion dollars constituted the
total commerce of American ports.
Although the period since 1914, the opening of the
Panama Canal, has witnessed a series of violent price
fluctuations as well as peace and war, the trends on
the whole for the Pacific Coast during the past two
decades would gladden the heart of the most melan
choly chamber of commerce secretary.
A remarkable fact is that in the period 1922-30 the
gain in ocean-borne commerce was seven times as
rapid on the Pacific slope as in the remainder of the
United States, and California ports suffered least from
the depression. One-fifth of the trade of the world
Ls now in the Pacific area.
To analyze a port near at hand: San Francisco.
Japan is San Francisco's best customer, and 1930 com
merce of $71,950,000 value passed in and out of the
Golden Gate to the Nipponese empire.
Total commerce for the same > ear between San
Franca to and other countries was as follows:
United Kingdom, $33,930,086; China and the Phil
ippines, about $24,000,000 each; Austrdia, $18,000,-
000; Germany, $10,000,000; Colombia, $14,000,000;
1 Canada, $10,000,000; and Brazil. Hongkong, the
Netherlands, France, Argentina, and Mexico
amounts from $2,500,000 to $5,300,000.
San Francisco is an attractive port for lines serv
ice, and is so far in the lead of other Pacific Coast
ports of America in this respect that it nets nearly
70 per cent, of the total transoceanic passenger busi
ness of the entire Coast. Passengers embarking from
the port of San Francisco in 1932 were about 107,000
and incoming passengers 100,000.
America has 40 per cent of its coastline on the Pa
cific, which possesses but three natural and one arti
ficial harbors of consequence, while approximately
27 per cent of all ocean-carried trade of the United
States, in the year 1929 for instance, passed through
Pacific ports. About 60 per cent of Pacific Coast trade
passes through California ports, and from 1914 to 1929
San Francisco's foreign trade tripled from $128,000,000
to $419,000,000.
Little wonder that Professor Mears believes that
the twentieth century will be known as the "Pacific
Era" in history.

titled: "Maritime Trade of V/estern United States."
The volume brings together for the first time "the
salient features of the shipping activities of the Amer
ican Pacific empire."
"Ocean shipping, more than any other international
activity, is involved in propaganda," states Dr. Mears.
"Various governmental agencies are vitally concerned
in the maintenance and promotion of military and
naval interests, upon a national as well as a commer
cial basis." The investigator of maritime trade must
therefore winnow away a bushel of chaff to obtain
a handful of wheat. Trustworthy data are elusive.
The great mass of international trade such as
agricultural products, fuels, raw materials for in
dustry, and manufactures, is moved on water
rather than land, and nowhere is this more in evi
dence than on the Pacific Coast. On the West Coast
for the calendar year 1 930, 118,409,000 short tons of
cargo valued at live billion dollars constituted the
total commerce of American ports.
Although the period since 1914, the opening of the
Panama Canal, has witnessed a series of violent price
fluctuations as well as peace and war, the trends on
the whole for the Pacific Coast during the past two
decades would gladden the heart of the most melan
choly chamber of commerce secretary.
A remarkable fact is that in the period 1922-30 the
gain in ocean-borne commerce was seven times as
rapid on the Pacific slope as in the remainder of the
United States, and California ports suffered least from
the depression. One-fifth of the trade of the world
Ls now in the Pacific area.
To analyze a port near at hand: San Francisco.
Japan is San Francisco's best customer, and 1930 com
merce of $71,950,000 value passed in and out of the
Golden Gate to the Nipponese empire.
Total commerce for the same > ear between San
Franca to and other countries was as follows:
United Kingdom, $33,930,086; China and the Phil
ippines, about $24,000,000 each; Austrdia, $18,000,-
000; Germany, $10,000,000; Colombia, $14,000,000;
1 Canada, $10,000,000; and Brazil. Hongkong, the
Netherlands, France, Argentina, and Mexico
amounts from $2,500,000 to $5,300,000.
San Francisco is an attractive port for lines serv
ice, and is so far in the lead of other Pacific Coast
ports of America in this respect that it nets nearly
70 per cent, of the total transoceanic passenger busi
ness of the entire Coast. Passengers embarking from
the port of San Francisco in 1932 were about 107,000
and incoming passengers 100,000.
America has 40 per cent of its coastline on the Pa
cific, which possesses but three natural and one arti
ficial harbors of consequence, while approximately
27 per cent of all ocean-carried trade of the United
States, in the year 1929 for instance, passed through
Pacific ports. About 60 per cent of Pacific Coast trade
passes through California ports, and from 1914 to 1929
San Francisco's foreign trade tripled from $128,000,000
to $419,000,000.
Little wonder that Professor Mears believes that
the twentieth century will be known as the "Pacific
Era" in history.
While predictors view the future with all too san
guinary a gloom, occasionally a shaft of light pierces
the economic night of the black and muddled Thirties.
Such a ray of encouragement, at least to Califor
nians, and in varying degrees to other sections of the
