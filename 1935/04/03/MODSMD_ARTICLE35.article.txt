In order to rest up from the rigours of a week's
vacation, Stanford's 4000 studying stooges now undergo
their yearly ten weeks of lights, music, and ,i>ay laugh
ter, known as spring quarter.
It is daring spring quarter that sleeping porches, on
which Stanford's shivering stooges have knocked their
knees together for six months, become of any use
| at all.
It is also during .spring quarter that the architects
start drawing plans for new houses. Just like the*
birds who begin building nests, Stanford Greeks start
feathering theirs for fall and winter rushing. It. is

I really going to sttu't on that palatial mansion, which
; plans th?y have been showing to prospective custo
\ mors for nigh unto three generations. There isn't a
j man they've pledged for MO years who hadn't counted
j on living in a place that looked like a Southern Cali
-1 forma movie pnlace 01 subdivision tract office. The
! old-timeis in the house can recall with a sigh the
first plans th;it were ever drawn up. Those were in
the good old days. Since then they've had to cut it
down so that there are only one or two swimming
pools, and the stables and servants quarters' have
given way to the ornamental bird bath and incidental
j statuaiy.
After thoroughly testing the matter out, I have de

I There are some good tales about some of our citi
zens who basketl in the Bohemian atmosphere of
Carmel over the week-end. But I can't tell them,
j Carmel is an interesting town. It overlooks beautiful
