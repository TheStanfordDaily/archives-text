MORE ALL-STAR
HOOP TEAMS

Here are a few more all-coast j
I hoop teams, and a promise that
| these will be the last.
On the "official" all-Pacific
| Coast team, as titled by its picker, ;
! J. Ered Bolder of Washington ,
State College, Dinty Moore, Stan- ;
ford high scorer and captain- |
elect, won a first team guard po
' sition, and Robin Lindsey was
given honorable mention. Others
on the first five were Hupp and
! Gultero of Southern California,
j Hihhard of Oregon, and Galer of i
( Washington.
Stanford's 1935 squad picked an j
all-opponent team, besides compil- j
1 ing other interesting data, at a bar- j
becue a week or so ago. On their
five were Kinner of Utah, Hupp,
Guttero, and Oram of the Trojans, 1
and Ashen of U.C.L.A. U.S.C. was i
the finest offensive team they met j
during the year, and Notre Dame !
the best defensively.
Othsr business concluded at the 1
get-together was the electing of J
Moore to captain the Indian five ,
during the 193G season and in his
junior yer.r, and the naming of for- j
ward Rod Bost as the honorary
captain for the season just closed. j

TOPPING NAMED ON
DYKES' FIVE

Harlan Dykes, at present free
lancing basketball coach but until j
recently Santa Clara mentor, nam
ed another. D ykes' all-stars are |
worth mentioning because his was |
the only team that included Keith :
Topping, Stanford senior who fi- i
nally managed to out-live the in
juries which broke up his third and
last hoop season.
Along with Topping, Murphy of
U.S.F., Hupp and Guttero of U.S.C.,
und Otten, Santa Clara, composed
the firs* string. Turner, forward,
and Moore, guard, were other Stan
ford players to be mentioned.

TO END
ALL-STAR TEAMS

Finally, there must be each sea-
I son an "all-star team to end all —
1 star teams," and this one should do
it. It was chosen by the women's
! sport editor of the Daily Trojan, and
j feminine heart flutter, not ability,
j was the criterion.
! Probably quoting only the part
I pertaining to Stanford will be pun
j ishment enough: "We chose Robin
Lindsey because we can just imag
ine him attending a social func
; tion in a swallow-tailed coat or
i garbed 'fit to kill' in the swagger
j men's sport clothes. . . . Gordon
| Mallatratt was right in there as
far as looks were concerned, but
; we found out that Gordon devoted
most of his time to baseball this
year, which eliminated him. Any
way, both of them could play on
our team any time."
Oww! All-star pickers to Walter

graves! If there ever was any dig
i nity to the making of news by
choosing all-star teams, it's gone
new.

A NEW TIP
FOR SHOTPUTTERS

Dink Templeton, who is credited
; with adding more to theories of
track ti'aining and form than any
other coach in recent years, has a j
new trick in shotputting which Jim
Reynolds, Johnny Lyman, and other
! Stanford weight men are trying out
at the present time.
Shotputters have always cud
dled the iron hall in the little
, hollow between the shoulder and
I the neck before hopping across !
i the circles for the put. Indian j
weight men now hold the ball off
and back of the shoulder, which
adds several inches to the drive
the hand can give the shot, mean
ing further distance, Templeton be
lieves.
