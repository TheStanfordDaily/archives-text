# Trojan Nine Trounces Cards With 8-2 Score
## 
### 
A familiar bugaboo of errors
stalked the Indian buseball players
yesterday as they fought gamely to
j stem the tide of Southern California
runs. The final count favored the
Trojans 8-2, and pushod Stanford
i farther into the league cellar.
Qimpbell Pitches
Johnny Campbell pitched a very
i acceptable game outside of the first
1 two innings when he failed to find
! the plate. Two free passes, a double
by pitcher Gonzales and an error by
j Clark put the game on ice in the
i second inning.
El Trojan collected two more un
i earned markers in the third. An
i error by Clark and two singles push
! Ed one over, and then Clark chose
| to make a doubtful play at second
j instead of first and Trojan Gonzales
| got credit for driving in another run.
The Indians scored their first
i marker in the second inning on
! Clark's double to left and a one
| base hit by Ferro. The Cards tacked
j on their last run in the fifth on a
! triple by Mallatratt and Ha mi Iton's

â€¢ infield out.
After the third inning, Campbell
had the situation well in hand. He
j allowed the slugging Trojans but two
singles in the last six innings. Both
of these hits were turned into runs,
j the first driving one across after
Tremains had tossed the pellet far
into right field, and the second aid
ing in a two run assault after Ham
ilton and Clark errored on easy
| chances.
Leidig Stars in Field
j It remained for Leidig, fleet cen
j ter fielder to turn in the fielding gem
of the afternoon. In the sixth inn
ing he raced in fast to make a shoe
| string catch of a line drive. Malla
tratt saved two bad throws by reach
ing out to spear the ball while lay
ing flat on the ground.
Besides his steiling play at the be
ginning Mallatratt nicked Gonzales
for two hits, one of them his triple
1 that bumped into the right field
fence on the first bounce. Clark col
lected a double and a single in his
I four trips to the plate.
