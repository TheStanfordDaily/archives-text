# Grid Practice Begins As 52 Men Turn Out
## 
### 
After being hushed for three
months, the old questions of a pass
defense and a football team "sev
eral deep in every position" come
back with a bound today as 52 pros
' pective Cardinal gridders begin
i their annual spring practice.
Tiny Thornhill will spend three
1 days a week during the next two
| months in drilling his men on funda
mentals; he has several new plays
and formations for experiment pur
i poses, and will spend much time in
; trying players out at new positions.
Much of the interest in spring
' practice will center about Thornhill's
efforts to find suitable replacements
j at the vulnerable left halfback and
j tackle posts, left wide open by the
I graduation of Jack Drown, Ed Let
tunich. Buck Van Dellen, and Bob
i Maentz.
Bobby Grayson, troubled with ill
ness, Bones Hamilton, engaged in
| baseball, and Bob Reynolds, track
j man, are among the regulars who
i have not signed as yet. Grayson is
expected out within two weeks, and
' Hamilton and Reynolds will report
; at the closc of the spring sports sea-
I sons.
! Thornhill said there will be no
' scrimmage for at least two weeks.

The S.P.C.A. in New York City
: keeps a number of mother cats on
! hand so that nursing kittens may be
i properly cared for.
