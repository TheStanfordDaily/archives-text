## Famous Bass Began Career As Boy Soprano 
### Barbara Sweet 
Feodor Chaliapin sings tonight in I
' the Pavilion at 8:20 o'clock.
; As the final attraction of the 1934- j
!35 Concert Series, the Associated
j Students present in concert one of |
j the greatest of all bassos, an ac- j
knowledged master of his art.
Chaliapin's musical career began I
j when he sang as a buy soprano in |
j various churches of Kazan, where he I
1 was bom. His attention was first '
| attracted to the world of the theatre j
j as he watched the antics of a famous |
j clown of the Volga region whose
booth was one of the leading attrac
tions of the annual fair.
Impressed by Opera
When he was 11 years old one of
his comrades in the church choir of
fered Chaliapin a ticket for the the
atre to see "A Russian Wedding."
From that day the boy dreamed of
! nothing else. In vain his parents
I apprenticed him in turn to a ghoe
j maker, a bookbinder, a wood-carver,
j forced him to work for a time in a j
j pawn shop and to assist his father !
I copying dry legal documents. His j
j mind was wholly absorbed with the j
i stage and, having attended per- '
formances of opera as well as plays |
at the Kazan theatre, he dreamed j
only of how to become an opera
singer.
After gi'adually working up j
i through the theatre engagements j
traveling opera companies to Rus- I
sian Imperial Opera, Chaliapin re- 1
ceived his first important engage- I
ment outside his native country I
when Gatti-Casazza, then manager j
of La Scala, called him to Milan to
| appear in the title role of Boito's
| "Mefistofele."
First Role '
It was Chaliapin's first role in
j Italian and his first appearance as j
j that character. His success with the j
j Italian public was instantaneous and
overwhelming, resulting in return
'engagements at La Scala, where he
made Moussorgsky's "Moris Cod
ounoff" known to Italy, and obtained
I contracts for appearances in Paris,
J Monte Carlo, and Buenos Aires.
Tickets for Chaliapin's concert in
