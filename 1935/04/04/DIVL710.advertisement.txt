It's on ultra-short wave radio telephone antenna—before
being raised above the dunes of Cape Cod.
Far some years, Bell System engineers have been studying
ultra-short waves. They have developed automatie tran»-
mitters and reeeivers which maybe connected with regular
telephone lines at points far from central offices. They hope
such radio links will be useful in giving telephone service
to points difficult to reach
by usual methods.
