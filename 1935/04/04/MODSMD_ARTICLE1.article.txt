# DEBATERS BACK PROM VACATION TOUR OF NORTH
## Mellinkoff, Rogers Place Third in Tournament For Western Title WIN OVER CANADIANS Gros Elected President Of Forensic Managers 
### 
Aftetr attending the meeting of
the Pacific Forensic League and cov
ering the northwestern swing of
Stanford's transcontinental debate
tour, varsity debaters Dave Mellin
kofT and Bill Rogers, and Manager
Bob Gros returned to the campus
yesterday.
Featuring speaking contests, tour
naments, and business sessions, the
forensic league conference met at
Whitman College, at Walla Walla,
Washington, on March 2U, 27, and
28. Leland Chapin, Stanford debate
coach, presided over the conference
c.s president of the league in which
14 leading Pacific Coast universities
claim membership.
I Jokers, speaking against 1!) rep
resentatives of other schools, eas
ily won the first prize in the "after
dinner speaking" contest which
was held at the final banquet ses
sion of the conference. He won
a large cup for Stanford as well as
an individual first-place award
for himself. Drawings were made
by the speakers 15 minutes before
their turn to speak, and Rogers
reached into the hat and drew the
subject, "The Obligation to Be nu
merous."
As student delegate from Stan
ford, Gros led several round-table
and business discussions, including
questions of debate: ethic - and busi
ness management ot debate tours.
He was re-elected president of the
Western Debate Managers Associa
tion.
In the debate tournament, Rogers
and Mellinkoff, who won the West
ern Championship Tournament last
fall, placed third, losing a 2-1 judges'
decision to U.C.L.A. The debate
tournament and the oratory contest
were won by U.C.L.A. while U.S.C.
placed first in the ex tempore speak
ing division.
Following this conference, the
three Stanfordites Hew to Van
couver last Friday night to keep a
debate engagement with the Uni
versity of British Columbia. This
clash was regarded by Mellin
koiT and Rogers as one of the fin
est, and surely the most unusual,
debate in which they had ever
participated.
Into the Oval Room of the Hotel
Vancouver before a select group of
the Canadian intelligentsia, the de
baters entered in a procession with
the jUdges and chairman. All speak
ers wore academic robes, and the en
tire procedure was extremely formal
and dignified. Vancouver papers re
ferred to the "solemn foolery" of
Rogers and the "frothy airiness of
delivery of the more experienced
Stanford debaters." The contrast
between the two teams was doubly
accentuated by the strong English
accent of the two Canadian debat
ers.
Professor J. Friend Day, faculty
adviser of the British Columbia
Parliamentary Forum, was chair
man, while the Committee of Judges
was composed of W. O. McLaren,
prominent Canadian engineer, Brig
adier-General Victor Odium, and the
Hon. Mr. Justice Lucas, chief jus
tice of the Supreme Court. The vote
was 3-0 in favor of Stanford, which
uphold the negative of the arms and
munitions question.
In Seattle, the Stanfordites par
ticipated in a symposium type of
debate with the University of Wash
ington before GOO people, the largest
audience ever to attend a debate on
that campus. MellinkofT upheld the
affirmative of the munitions em
bargo question while Rogers and two
Washington speakers attacked the
embargo advocated by MellinkofT.
No decision was rendered as the en
tire symposium was conducted as an
experiment.
In reference to the completed
Stanford transcontinental tour, Gros
remarked: "We feel that the tour has
been a great success from two
standpoints. First, it has been a
wonderful experience for the six
able Stanford men who have met
the 60 colleges; and second, it has
created an immense amount of fa
vorable publicity for Stanford and
its activities, a fact which has been
concretely shown in the interest evi
denced in the tours by schools and
papers throughout the country. We
are appreciative of the co-operation
of the Executive Committee and
Manager Ben Cave, without which
the tour would not have been pos
sible."
