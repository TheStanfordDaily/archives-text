# Card Trackmen Look for Fresno Win on Saturday
## Marty, Noted Bay Stars To Enter I.C.4-A. Benefit 
### 
Stanford's national championship
track team will make another bid
to justify its title Saturday. J. Flint
Banner's Fresno Staters will be the
opposition; a victory will be quite
satisfactory to the Cards.
Sam Klopstock got out of the
hospital yesterday and looked as
spry and springy as ever, but con
fined his workout to a good warmup
and hkimming a few highs. His
presence is an important one, for his
points will be needed Saturday.
Battle in Hurdles
Hanner has in the lows Floyd
Wilson, Far Western Conference
Title holder, and a 23.9 man. In
the highs there is no one under 15
flat to press Sam, but there will be
Roy Kirkpatrick, one of the added
attractions, who has run 14.6 and

who recently scored 26 points in one
meet for Montezuma.
Skull and Snakes is sponsoring
the meet, and has already received
word that these six men, all cham
pions of one loop or another, v/ill
compete: Walter Marty, world's
champion high jumper, John Lyman,
once shot put recoid holder, Roy
Kirkpatrick, State prep hurdle cham
pion, Norm Bright., best two-milcr
on the coast, Ed Waterbury, 220 foot
javelin man, and Gordy Dunn, once
iniercodegiate discus champion,
Negotiations are still on with Ben
Eastman, Here Laborde, Bobby
Jones, and some of the other un
attached greats around the bay. With
the right conditions, which are pos
sible, Marty may try for a 6.10 world
record high jump.
Who is going to run the sprints for
Stanford is still a moot question.
Chuck Voigt was not a hie to pour
on all of his speed yesterday; he
must still wait for time and a hot
day to ail up his ailing tendon and
take out the kinks. And neither is
Ray Dean ready to duplicate his
consistent junior college time of 0.8
Manner has Milton Holt, who is
touted to have beaten George Ander
son at Glandale J. C., as weil as
several other 10-flat men.
Pole Vaulter Cornelius Warmer
dam looks like a first place for
Fresno, with a spohemore jump of
13.7.. Dink Templeton has been
working Tini Ginn and Arne Ander
son. but they have yet to make the
grade at 13 feet.
Sales Shows Improvement
An encouraging note for the Care's
is the work of Dud Sales in the
javelin. Sales, who can do just
about anything in the sports line,
has been flirting with the 200 foot
mark for the last two weeks, and will
be heiped by competition Saturday
from teammate Johnny Mottram, Ed
Waterbury, and Clarence Rowland,
who has done and even 200.
. ..Card distance men will face Elroy
Robinson, a 1.53.5 880 man and Norm
Bright, the Indian ineligible. War
top Card miler, may run both the
half and, the mile. Br.'**ht will
probably concentrate on the two
mile, where he will be running
against Dave Devlin, who has been
doing nicely this week.
Tickets are 25 cents, and may be
bought at the A.S.S.U. office.

son. but they have yet to make the
grade at 13 feet.
Sales Shows Improvement
An encouraging note for the Care's
is the work of Dud Sales in the
javelin. Sales, who can do just
about anything in the sports line,
has been flirting with the 200 foot
mark for the last two weeks, and will
be heiped by competition Saturday
from teammate Johnny Mottram, Ed
Waterbury, and Clarence Rowland,
who has done and even 200.
. ..Card distance men will face Elroy
Robinson, a 1.53.5 880 man and Norm
Bright, the Indian ineligible. War
top Card miler, may run both the
half and, the mile. Br.'**ht will
probably concentrate on the two
mile, where he will be running
against Dave Devlin, who has been
doing nicely this week.
Tickets are 25 cents, and may be
bought at the A.S.S.U. office.
Stanford's national championship
track team will make another bid
to justify its title Saturday. J. Flint
Banner's Fresno Staters will be the
opposition; a victory will be quite
satisfactory to the Cards.
Sam Klopstock got out of the
hospital yesterday and looked as
spry and springy as ever, but con
fined his workout to a good warmup
and hkimming a few highs. His
presence is an important one, for his
points will be needed Saturday.
Battle in Hurdles
Hanner has in the lows Floyd
Wilson, Far Western Conference
Title holder, and a 23.9 man. In
the highs there is no one under 15
flat to press Sam, but there will be
Roy Kirkpatrick, one of the added
attractions, who has run 14.6 and

who recently scored 26 points in one
meet for Montezuma.
Skull and Snakes is sponsoring
the meet, and has already received
word that these six men, all cham
pions of one loop or another, v/ill
compete: Walter Marty, world's
champion high jumper, John Lyman,
once shot put recoid holder, Roy
Kirkpatrick, State prep hurdle cham
pion, Norm Bright., best two-milcr
on the coast, Ed Waterbury, 220 foot
javelin man, and Gordy Dunn, once
iniercodegiate discus champion,
Negotiations are still on with Ben
Eastman, Here Laborde, Bobby
Jones, and some of the other un
attached greats around the bay. With
the right conditions, which are pos
sible, Marty may try for a 6.10 world
record high jump.
Who is going to run the sprints for
Stanford is still a moot question.
Chuck Voigt was not a hie to pour
on all of his speed yesterday; he
must still wait for time and a hot
day to ail up his ailing tendon and
take out the kinks. And neither is
Ray Dean ready to duplicate his
consistent junior college time of 0.8
Manner has Milton Holt, who is
touted to have beaten George Ander
son at Glandale J. C., as weil as
several other 10-flat men.
Pole Vaulter Cornelius Warmer
dam looks like a first place for
Fresno, with a spohemore jump of
13.7.. Dink Templeton has been
working Tini Ginn and Arne Ander

grade at 13 feet.
