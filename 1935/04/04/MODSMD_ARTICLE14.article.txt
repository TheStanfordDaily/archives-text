### 
WASHINGTON, April 3 (/P). â€”
Secretary Swaruson today announced
that Admiral Frank B. Upham,
commander in chief of the Asiatic
fleet, would visit Yokohama aboard
his flagship, the new 10,000-ton
cruiser Augusta, on May 3, the day
the main fleet is scheduled to begin
its Pacific maneuvers.
Describing the visit, as a "good
will tour," Swanson said Upham
would spend two weeks at Yoko
hama, and another week at Kobe.
Several destroyers will later visit
Japan, he .said, expressing the hope
all would combine to dispell "any
bed feeling" in Japan over the ma
neuvers.
Inclusion of Germany in a future
naval parley was advocated by
Swanson in the course of his press
conference today. The secretary re
called that while he was a delegate
to the 1932 disarmament conference
at Geneva, "we tried to include
Germany."
