The authors of the play, Josef and

appear such surprisingly peculiar
and strong resemblances of the forms
of human life, especially in regard
I to the struggle for life, the cruel
I cleverness of instinct, the care for
making its kind secure, so that in
! pondering upon the insects it is im
j possible not to think of the human
race."

tles hoard their money and live self

ishly. The ichneumon flies murder
the crickets and stuff their larders

Finally the red ants and the yel
low ants wage a ruthless and devas
tating war to see which shall have
the right to travel a particular sun
lit path between two blades of
grass. The play ends on a hopeful
note in the epilogue, however.
