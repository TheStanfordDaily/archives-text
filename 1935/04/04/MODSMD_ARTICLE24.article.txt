# Series Ends As Chaliapin Grips House
## Large Audience Hears Famous Basso 
### Barbara Sweet 
Enthusiastically received by a
better than average sized Concert
Scries audience, Feodor Chaliapin
last night demonstrated that he still
has the mellowness of tone and
richness of voice that won him the
high place he holds in the musical
world.
Not the least of his charm lay in
the dramatic feeling with which ho
interpreted his numbers, and the
natural, unaffected maimer he
! adopted toward the audience. He
j announced the selections himself,
and English translations oi the songs
were provided the listeners, a com
mendable innovation.
A criticism that might be made of
i the great basso's renditions was his
noticeable lack of volume, espe
cially in such songs as the well
known "Volga Boatman." This, of
course, was to be expected.
Of the serious selections the aria
of Khan Konchak from Borodin's
"Prince Igor" was especially fine.
Emphasizing the dramatic qualities
of this number, Chaliapin also re
i vealed in it the full and pure tone
quality of his voice, perhaps his
I most outstanding attribute. The
Russian Convict Song," an old folk
song arranged by Karatigin, was
moving.
"Mephito's Song of the Flea,"
written by Goethe and set to mu
sic by Moussorgsky, was the most
delightful of the lighter numbers.
Even had the audience read no
English translation, the humor of the
: song would have been conveyed
â–  clearly by Chaliapin's expressive in
terpretation.
i The only song sung in English
j in the entire program was the final
I encore. Financially the concert was
i also successful, according to Norman
Barnes, Concert Scries manager,
over $800 being taken in.
