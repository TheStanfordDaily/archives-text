# University Victorious In Fight With Menlo Park Liquor Sellers
## Mile-and-a-Half Law to Go Into Immediate Effect; Stores to Close 31 LICENSES REVOKED New Decision Bans Sale Of Beverages Stronger Than 3.2 Beer 
### Dick Hodgson 
Climaxing its two-year protest,
j Stanford University won its fight
with the Menlo Park liquor dealers
yesterday when the State Board of
Equalisation at Sacramento can
celled the liquor licenses of 31 es
tablishments within the mile and a
! half radius of the campus bounda
ries.
"We are very much pleased to
have the State Board of Equaliza
tion follow the decision of the
Supreme Court in giving the Uni
versity security against the crea
tion of 'slum villages' at our front
door," President Ray Lyman Wil
bur stated to The Daily yesterday.
California Supreme Court rulings
made last year stated that no liquor
1 should be sold within a mile and a
! half of the campus boundaries. The
court also specified that the mile
I and a half should be measured by
1 airline from the boundaries.
Despite the Supreme Court rul
ings against the sale of liquor, the
State Board of Equalization post
poned putting the ruling into effect
until this time. University authori
ties, however, have maintained the
fight until definite action was
! reached.
Francis Keesling, assistant sec
retary of the Board, sent out no
tices of the cancellation of the li
censes of the 31 stores yesterday
to take effect immediately. Twen
ty-seven of the stores were in
Menlo Park and four in North
Palo Alto.
Cancellation of the licenses will
| ban the sale of any drinks stronger
! than 3.2 beer within the mile and
one-half limit. Congress passed a
ruling before the repeal of the 18th
1 amendment that 3.2 beer was a non
intoxicating beverage, which en
j ables the dealers to maintain its
j sale.
I Renewal of the licenses for 1935
was made at the beginning of the
year in direct defiance of the Su
preme Court ruling, however, and
dealers who received 1935 licenses
j will have the license fee refunded,
j *rhe Gilmorc Bill, which has
| been pigeon-holed by the Com
-1 mil tee on Public Morals of the
1 State Legislature, proposes to
nullify the court decision by al
lowing the sale of liquor within
i the mile and one-half limit. A
large storm of protest has met
j this bill, so that it is doubtful
th;\t immediate passage of the bill
will be forthcoming.
Almon E. Roth, University comp
j troller, stated his views on the de
cision yesterday: "In fairness to the
| board, the University wishes to point
out that the delayed decision was
| iii large part occasioned by the fact,
j that the University requested the
board to proceed slowly in the mat
| ter, and if necessary hold individual
! hearings with the dealers."
