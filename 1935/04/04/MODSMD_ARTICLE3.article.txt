# Austrian Arms Increase Adds To War Threat
## Problems Confront Stresa Peace Conference 
### 
LONDON, April 3 (/P>. —Austria's
■ sudden decision to increase her army
i tonight apparently added one more
| problem to thoss confronting the
Stresa Conference at which, high
: sources said, Great Britain will do
| all in her power to weld Europe's na
tions into one far-reaching security
system.
While British officials, surprised
Ly tlic report from Vienna, declined
'o comment pending receipt of fur-
I ther information, first impressions
were that the Austrian move would
tend to create further difficulties at
the Stresa Conference.
Observers received with interest
1 the reported decision of the Lithu
anian government to protest to Ger
many against asserted anti-Lithu-
I anian demonstrations and threatened ;
| rcprLvds for the recent sentencing of
91 Nazis convicted of plotting to re- !
( trieve Memel for Germany.
There was belief in some quar
ters here that Italy will present rad
ical methods of military action, prob- j
1 ably proposing an armed alliance |
against Germany.
In Paris, the realistic French ap
| proach to the tripartite conference \
was illustrated in the proposal sub
j mitted to the Chamber of Deputies' <
| subcommittee on national defense j
I that 120,000 army conscripts, due to j
j end service in mid-April, be kept
funder arms at least three months i
; more.
