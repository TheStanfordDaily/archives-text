# The
						New Theatre Assumes Its Final Form
## 
### 
fifteen years of speculation and hope seem
destined finally to become an actuality by the ,
end of this spring quarter, when ground
breaking for the new Theatre will in all prob
ability take place.
The history of :i movement the new
theatre h;is been interwoven in all the under
graduate student activities ot the last lour
years, (lommitlees have been formed in the
past from every phase of campus life which
might possibly have any bearing on the con
struction of such a type of building. I lie
opinions and advice of faculty and students
interested in any of the phases of drama, little j
theatre movements, and cultural values ol any
type have been solicited.
As a result, final sets of plans have been
drawn up. They embody advice and sug
gestion from all corners of the campus. The
building itself as it will eventually be erected
represents a composite of plans, combining the
most desirable ideas that could be utilized in j
the construction of a modern college theatre.
The unification of a War Memorial build- i
ing theme which at the same time would con
tain all the elements necessary to develop a i
Stanford school of the theatre with all its |
facilities and cultural values, has long been the
ideal of the proponents of the new thealr^.;
in the latest plans which represent year's <>P
Planning ton the part <Vf architects, a type of j
construction has been designed that wil'l'
Line the two ideas. ~ .«
Providing for a sealing capacity ot over
fifteen hundred people in a spacious audi
torium that will allow half the student body j
at one time to enjoy assemblies and plays,; j
plans provide for this seating limit t,o be cut
to eight hundred people when occasion
demands smaller and more intimate assem
blies. There will be a little theatre, rehearsal,
dressing and makeup rooms, and all the other i
features of a building designed to serve as
ttic nucleus for an art center of the campus.
To finance the new theatre will require a
good deal of planning and probably fifteen
years to pay oil the loans which will be Moated
to construct the new building.
Credit is due to the administration author
ities for co-operating with students to a point
where actual work will soon he commenced.
All those members who have served on theatre
committees for the years of preliminary
planning can well feel justified for the part
they have played in the new project.
