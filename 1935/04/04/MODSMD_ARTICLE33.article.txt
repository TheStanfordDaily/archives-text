# A 						Reminder Of An old Tradition
## 
### 
■ Stanford's much-discussed hut easily for
goten tradition of "no smoking on I lie Quad"
became embellished with a concrete illustra
tion during winter quarter finals, when a
glowing cigarette, carelessly tossed aside, set
lire to a classroom.
Such practical reasons as this are not the
only hasis On which that tradition is founded.
While it is true that the non-smoking custom
does lower I 'Diversity insurance rates and
keeps the Quad free from unsightly match
packages and cigarette butts, still the hack
hone of the tradition exists in sentiment a
sentiment which is too easily forgotten in our
careless times.
The original idea was no administrative
decree. It came directly from the handful of
original students, who, before their lirst week
of classes had passed, voted a resolution that
there should he no smoking on the Quad, for
which David Starr,Jordan wrote "we all I'elt a
sort of reverence."
Many traditions have gone into the mental
waslehaskct since Stanford h:is expanded.
Women climb the once-sacred Law Steps, the
Hough vanishes into neat slacks and white
shoes, and cars sail gayly past while other
students wait in vain for "a ride to Paly."
In that careless pseudo-cynicism which we
are apt to ailed, there is too little thinking,
too little harking back to the day when love
and respect fur the founders prompted such a
custom.
Students, and professors as well, who either
consider themselves above such "juvenile"
things as tradition or are simply careless,
have tailed to grasp the real Stanford, where
I radii ion has a meaning.
