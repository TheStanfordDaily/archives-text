in the hands of live persons.
Frayed nerves, irritated by a rash editor,

the ravings of a student editor with lixed,
perhaps too "liberal" ideas. The board wished
to subdue "wild-eyed" persons in charge of
the collegiate press—to infringe on the free
dom of the press. It wished to throttle a noisy,
irritating "nuisance."
