Capitol Hill,
Washington, D.C.
Editor, The Daily:
The New Deal has passed its second birthday, with
little celebration, but with considerable .superficial
stock-taking in editorial columns'throughout the na
tion. Most of the comment has been on the various
accomplishments or bunglings of the many emergency
agencies. The most obvious thing is their great num
ber and the confusion their contemplation brings to
the ordinary citizen.
What affects John Q. Public much, much more Ls
the tremendous increase in the scope of the functions
of governmental activity. Incidental to that increase
is a development of peculiar concern to college men
and women. With the widening sphere of government
activity has come an increased demand for expertly
trained personnel in many fields, particularly in social
economics. But this is simply a greater demand for a
kind of personnel already in existence.
Administrative Law »
The development which offers an opportunity al
most entirely new is that in administrative law. Many
of the present emergency agencies, have functions in
part legislative and judicial, as well as purely execu
tive. A number of the permanent offices of the gov
ernment function similarly, particularly the several in
dependent, regulatory commissions. The effect of (he
order§ of these agfcnei«ii is very often the effect of law.
A recent survey of the decisions and functions of the
National Labor Relations Board showed that the ad
ministrative decisions and orders of that board were
as effective and binding on the parties involved as
the most solemn law of the land.
No Congressman, no Senator participates in
these fiats. No President signs them. They are
not vetoed. There is, jn effect, a new body of law
growing up which has not been established in
legislative enactment or judicial enunciation. That
there is a place for it in the proper conduct of
government is undoubted, for it has its counter
parts in foreign governments, and its roots and
mild beginnings in this country are almost as ftld
as the government itself.
But with the sudden growth of this type of govern
ment activity it has become apparent that a special
training in administrative law should be a part of
the background of those public servants who are to
engage in the conduct of this work. No less important
is the need for the same training for those outside the
government service who will present the interests of
citizens to these administrative bodies as attorneys
present their clients' interests in court.
Law Schools Slow
This has already been recognized, for example, by
the Interstate Commerce Commission, which allows
only attorneys licensed to practice before it to present
cases. But the law schools of the country have been
slow to awake to this new field. Some of them have
offered single courses in administrative law. George
Washington University, in the Capital, and sensitive to
the development, has gone a bit further. But the great
awakening is yet to come.
It has hoen delayed by academic conservatism, in
part, and in part by the feeling that the attorneys who
leave their law books and represent their clients be
fore boards, commissions, and departments, are glori
fied lobbyists. Many of them are. But the opportunity
awaits expertly trained college graduates with a broad
background in governmental functions, and in the
growing body of administrative law and procedure.
They can and will take the place of lobbyists.
(To be concluded tomorrow)
