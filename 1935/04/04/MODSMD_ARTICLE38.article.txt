IN DEFENSE OF DRAMATIC
COUNCIL
Editor, The Daily:
To those who have been closely
connected with the workings oi
Stanford dramatics aud Stanford
Dramatic Councils for the last tw<
or three years it seems'obvi jus that
the time is ripe to abandon certain
predilections concerning' those ac
tivities—predilections, for the mosi
part, founded on gossip and misin
formation.
Wednesday's Daily editorial, en
titled "The Dramatic Council Wish
es to Retire," reveals an unfortu
nate and long-lived misunderstand
ing regarding the purposes, attitudes,
and accomplishments of the Stan
ford Dramatic Council.
Last Tuesday the Dramatic Coun
cil passed a resolution to the effect
that "the dramatics administration,
financially and executively, is a
function of the University rather'
than of the students." The Daily
brands this action as "startling." In
truth, there is nothing startling
about it. That the administration is
more competent to run dramatics
than the.students is b>
practically every other college in the
United States.
With plays and theatres closing
up in such theatrical centers as New
York and Chicago, it is entirely too
much to expect that students should
be able to make expenses and still
put on an artistic performance.
Students not directly connected"vviih
the business end of dramatics do not
realize that, up until January oi
this year the students paid an item
of $1000 for director's salary to thi
University each year. (This figure
has now been cut to $700 in an at
tempt to pay off the Dramatic Coun
cil debt contracted in past years.)
This terrific expense, added to ;
manager's salary, electrician's sal
ary, and a thousand and one other
items, has proven insurmountable.
Dramatic managers, actors, Coun
cil members—all have appealed to
Dr. Wilbur to put an end either to
the director's salary, or to students'
control of dramatics. Tuesday's res
olution of the .Dramatic Council is
simply a statement of this situation,
and an appeal to rid the students ol
a financial burden that is extremely
hard to meet.
The enlarged Dramatic Council,
with its eleven members, is not wish
ing "to retire." If dramatics is to
remain in the hands of the students,
in spitt* Of protests and resolutions,
the students should be represented
by a goodly number ol' their body.
The present Dramatic Council, in
spite -of its large membership, and
"torrid" cessions, gets its business
done. The Council as a whole feels
that they perform their duties com
petently. Director Timmons f< els
that they perform their duties com
petently.
The Executive Committee, in re
fusing to take action 0:1 a motion
to change the Council's member
ship, indicated that they feel that
the Council performs its duties com
! petently. Meetings may be long,
j differences of opinion may arise, but
|if the students are to be saddled
with a financial bugbear, if control
is to remain in the students' hands,
those students are certainly not go
ing "to retire" from control of their
own financial and artisfic policy.
If we cannot improve the situa
tion of a large director's salary, we
must make the best of the situation
as it is. This is just what the present
Dramatic Council is trying conscien
tiously to do.

Wednesday's Daily editorial, en
titled "The Dramatic Council Wish
es to Retire," reveals an unfortu
nate and long-lived misunderstand
ing regarding the purposes, attitudes,
and accomplishments of the Stan
ford Dramatic Council.
Last Tuesday the Dramatic Coun
cil passed a resolution to the effect
that "the dramatics administration,
financially and executively, is a
function of the University rather'
than of the students." The Daily
brands this action as "startling." In
truth, there is nothing startling
about it. That the administration is
more competent to run dramatics
than the.students is b>
practically every other college in the
United States.
With plays and theatres closing
up in such theatrical centers as New
York and Chicago, it is entirely too
much to expect that students should
be able to make expenses and still
put on an artistic performance.
Students not directly connected"vviih
the business end of dramatics do not
realize that, up until January oi
this year the students paid an item
of $1000 for director's salary to thi
University each year. (This figure
has now been cut to $700 in an at
tempt to pay off the Dramatic Coun
cil debt contracted in past years.)
This terrific expense, added to ;
manager's salary, electrician's sal
ary, and a thousand and one other
items, has proven insurmountable.
Dramatic managers, actors, Coun
cil members—all have appealed to
Dr. Wilbur to put an end either to
the director's salary, or to students'
control of dramatics. Tuesday's res
olution of the .Dramatic Council is
simply a statement of this situation,
and an appeal to rid the students ol
a financial burden that is extremely
hard to meet.
The enlarged Dramatic Council,
with its eleven members, is not wish
ing "to retire." If dramatics is to
remain in the hands of the students,
in spitt* Of protests and resolutions,
the students should be represented
by a goodly number ol' their body.
The present Dramatic Council, in
spite -of its large membership, and
"torrid" cessions, gets its business
done. The Council as a whole feels
that they perform their duties com
petently. Director Timmons f< els
that they perform their duties com
petently.
The Executive Committee, in re
fusing to take action 0:1 a motion
to change the Council's member
ship, indicated that they feel that
the Council performs its duties com
! petently. Meetings may be long,
j differences of opinion may arise, but
|if the students are to be saddled
with a financial bugbear, if control
is to remain in the students' hands,
those students are certainly not go
ing "to retire" from control of their
own financial and artisfic policy.
If we cannot improve the situa
tion of a large director's salary, we
must make the best of the situation
as it is. This is just what the present
Dramatic Council is trying conscien
tiously to do.
