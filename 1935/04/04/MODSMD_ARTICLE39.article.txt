TIMES SQUARE LADY"'
At Stanford Theatre
A fast moving comedy that is well
worth seeing, Virginia Bruce, a
honey of a blonde and a perfectly
swell little actress, plays a gang
ster's daughter, who outwits the;

crooks coveting
her estate. Op
posite he r is
personable Rob
ert Taylor—and
P i n k y Tomlin.
Pinky should go
far in pictures.
He's got a mm l

iiv. S \<l. tl w«. vv.
lelivery and a melodious singing
v'oice, particularly effective whei
rendering Pinky's own "The Objecl
)f My Affections."
The featured attraction, "The
Iron Duke," is spectacular, but
•ather dull. That precise, studied
little man with the monocle, Mr.
George Arliss, attempts to imper
sonate Wellington, and he does a
iamnable job of it. fhe perform
ance suffers by comparison with
C. Aubrey Smith's. His dynamic
and very human Wellington was
h° ontstand'""' personality in Mr.
Arliss' own "Rothschild."
H. G. Lowe
"Popeye" has been found to be
he bes.tnknown comic character.
