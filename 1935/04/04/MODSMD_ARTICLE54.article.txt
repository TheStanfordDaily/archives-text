# INDIAN NINE HAS CHANCE TO BEAT BEARS IN SERIES
## 
### 
Despite the spotty showing of the
Indian nine in their last few games,
Coach Harry Wolter can still smile
when the California series is men
tioned. In losing to the Trojans,
the Cards showed flashes of bril
liance that may spell trouble for the
Bears when they invade the Sunken
Diamond Saturday.
The infield, long a cause of worry
to Wolter. now shows signs of coming
around. Frank Tremaine's fielding
has improved tremendously and only
on rare occasions does he throw the
ball away at first.
Clark Shows Improvement
Ed Clark fielded well with the
exception of two balls hit to his right.
His throwing was bad, but if he can
field and throw for nine innings as he
did several times during the Troy
fray, then the weak .spot of the in
field will plugged.
Howell Turner, subbing for the
injured Jim Woolley, played a good
game at second and added practice
should improve his play greatly.
His hitting is nothing to boast of
as yet, but may improve in time to
be of use in the Cal series.
Gordon Mallatratt, star first sacker,
rounds out the infield that will
either make or break the team when
it meets the Bears Saturday. Gordy
is well up among the leading hitters
t)f the league.
Oct Morgan to Catch
Behind the bat, Wolter plans to
use Oct Morgan in place of Mike
Ferro. Morgan, it is hoped, will add
to the hitting strength, which aside
from Mallatratt and Hamilton has
been woefully weak, especially with
men on the paths.
Stan Anderson will get the call
for mound duty. The chunky right
hander has lots of stuff and if he is
right, the Bear batters will have
