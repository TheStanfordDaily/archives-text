# Dizzy Dean Fined For Breaking Training Rules
## 
### 
DOTHAN, ALA., April 3 (/P)—
Dizzy Dean had something new to
talk about tonight--$lOO fine handed
down by manager Frankie Frisch—
but the oratorical pitching ace of
the St. Louis Cardinals was strangely
silent.
Frisch cracked a training rules
whip over the backs of his lagging
world champions today and the lash
stung two players with fines. Two
others were sent home. Dizzy, well
known for his inability to take fines
graciously, was stung the hardest.
