# Bruin Netmen To Face Cards
## Victory Over Bruins Should Clinch League Title 
### 
Hoping to make a clean sweep
of the nine matches, Coach Sherman
Lockwood's varsity tennis team will
lace the U. C. L. A. netmen in a re
turn match at 1:30 Saturday on the
Card courts. Only Bill Seward, third
singles player, lost to the Bruins in
the Los Angeles clash during vaca
tion, and he has a fine chance to turn
the tables on George Bidwell, who
defeated him by the close scores
of 7-5, 2-6, 7-5.
Lee, Briggs Meet
Captain Sammy Lee of the Indians
and U. C. L. A.'s Stan Briggs should
wage another nip-and-tuck battle
in the first singles. Lee finished fast
to win the third and deciding set
last week. Another close scrap was
that between Johnny Law and Frank
Stewart in the third singles. Their
j return engagement may well go
either way Saturday.
Horace Haight, Carlton Pearson,
| and Bob Miller, playing in the fourth,
! fifth, and sixth positions for the
j Uclans, lost one-sided matches in
J straight sets to Stanl'ordites Ben
J Dey, Jack Lynch, and Bob Pommer,
j respectively. Each Indian netman
I will be heavily favmed to repeat
! his victory, but the Bruins are
! capable of better games.
DOUBLES ONE-SIDED
All three doubles matches were
easy for Coach Lockwood's racket-
J wfelders in the southland, but may
jbe much closer Saturday. Lee and
j Pommer will probably again face
I Briggs and Stewart in the first four-
I man match, and the second and third
j should be Seward-Dey vs. Bidwell
j Henry Uhl and Law-Lynch vs.
j Haight-Joe Robinson. Since no lad-
I der matches are being played this
week, the Stanford rankings, as well
as the Uclan's, will probably be un
changed.
If the Cards win this match, they
will practically cinch at least a tie
for first place in the Pacific Coast
| Conference standings. U.S.C. and
j California will fight it out for second
• place, and U.C.L.A., if she loses to
i Stanford Saturday, will be sent
j deeper into the cellar. Admission
to this series of matches, which will
j mark the most important point in
I the Indian schedule, will be free to
j students.

Captain Sammy Lee of the Indians
and U. C. L. A.'s Stan Briggs should
wage another nip-and-tuck battle
in the first singles. Lee finished fast
to win the third and deciding set
last week. Another close scrap was
that between Johnny Law and Frank
Stewart in the third singles. Their
j return engagement may well go
either way Saturday.
Horace Haight, Carlton Pearson,
| and Bob Miller, playing in the fourth,
! fifth, and sixth positions for the
j Uclans, lost one-sided matches in
J straight sets to Stanl'ordites Ben
J Dey, Jack Lynch, and Bob Pommer,
j respectively. Each Indian netman
I will be heavily favmed to repeat
! his victory, but the Bruins are
! capable of better games.
DOUBLES ONE-SIDED
All three doubles matches were
easy for Coach Lockwood's racket-
J wfelders in the southland, but may
jbe much closer Saturday. Lee and
j Pommer will probably again face
I Briggs and Stewart in the first four-
I man match, and the second and third
j should be Seward-Dey vs. Bidwell
j Henry Uhl and Law-Lynch vs.
j Haight-Joe Robinson. Since no lad-
I der matches are being played this
week, the Stanford rankings, as well
as the Uclan's, will probably be un
changed.
If the Cards win this match, they
will practically cinch at least a tie
for first place in the Pacific Coast
| Conference standings. U.S.C. and
j California will fight it out for second
• place, and U.C.L.A., if she loses to
i Stanford Saturday, will be sent
j deeper into the cellar. Admission
to this series of matches, which will
j mark the most important point in
I the Indian schedule, will be free to
j students.

Hoping to make a clean sweep
of the nine matches, Coach Sherman
Lockwood's varsity tennis team will
lace the U. C. L. A. netmen in a re
turn match at 1:30 Saturday on the
Card courts. Only Bill Seward, third
singles player, lost to the Bruins in
the Los Angeles clash during vaca
tion, and he has a fine chance to turn
the tables on George Bidwell, who
defeated him by the close scores
of 7-5, 2-6, 7-5.
