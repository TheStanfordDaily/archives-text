### 
A REAL 810 MEET
ONCE MORE

1935 may see the fall of Stanford
las champions, but it also brings a
j great revival in track and field in
-1 terest in northern California. The
Big Meet will again be just what
' the name indicate;*. For the past
decade the annual meeting between
Stanford and California has awak
ened little interest: the U.C. follow
i ers accepted defeat as inevitable.
This year the meet may be doped
as a toss-up, witli the victory go
ing to the team producing the
i most come - through athletes.
Stanford will not be overwhelm -
j ing favorites as they have been
for the past ten years; the pre
dictors will give Cal a slight edge,
if anybody.
Beside# a scramble for every place
! between the two teams, the Big
. Meet will bring several outstanding
j individual duels. The opening event
will find CaTs Bob Heavy, sensa
tional sophomore miler, facing Stan
ford's veterans, Warren Dixon and
Chuck Nimmo. Nimmo has run
nearly five seconds faster than
Heavy, but the U.C. ace seems to
be able to run just fast enough to
win. The 14-year-old meet record
j of 4:21 is as good as gone.

HURDLE RACES
WILL BE CLASSIC

In the hurdles Sammy Klopstock,
I the Indians' national champ, will be
I pitted against a great quartet oi'
! Bear stick men, Tom Moore, John
| Wood, Captain Dick Coe, and Del
1 Fishback. Moore, who transferred
j from Sacramento Junior College
I with Wood, has lowered the Ed-
I wards Field high hurdle mark al
most every time he has run.
Just on the side will be sucli
attractions as six 200-foot jrwelin
throwers; George Anderson,
claimed by many as the world's
fastest human, though only a Cal
sophomore; ,and the possibility of
Big Meet records being broken in
a half dozen events.
A sellout is already predicted for
the Edwards Stadium. Just a year
ago 15,000 people wouldn't have
gone to three Big Meets.
SHORTS—
More Stanford men are listed
among the world's record holders
for regular track and field college
events than for any other one or
ganization . . . and more world's
records for the 15 college events
have been made at Palo Alto than
any other place. . . . Coach John
Bunn promised jackets to the In
dian hoopsters if they won two
games on the Midwest trip last De
cember, hence the recent outburst
of red sweaters. . . . Phil Levy
hitch-hiked to the Long Beach re
lays before the vacation and took
second to "Slitiger" Dunn in the
discus with a toss of 157 feet. . . .

Eb Sellers, who won the two-mile
in the Washington - Stanford meet
last week, tried to make the finan
cial ends meet in the Stanford med
school for a couple of quarters.
. . . He's got the best two-mile
mark on the Coast.
Ace of the 1935 track pictures
seen in this region is a recent
Los Angeles Times photo of Bud
Deacon, one of Stanford's "Seven
Avengers" of last year, vaulting
at 14 feet 5 inches. Deacon ip
pears absolutely above the bar,
the photo being taken just as he
was starting down. But the bar
was eventually knocked off, and
another of Deacon's tries at the
world's record, now 14 feet 4%
inches, was lost. Later in the af
ternoon he attempted 14 feet 10
inches, and barely missed again.
U.S.C. has somewhat of a frosh
track team . . . not as good as last
year, but with three men who could
place in any college meet in th£
country: Tex Milner, 214-foot jav
elin thrower; Delos Thurber, with
a mark of 6 feet 6 inches in the
high jump, and Don Skinner, 23-foot
10-inches broad jumper. . . . Cap
tain Jimmy Gilhula of the famed
Trojan swimmers broke 16 world's
records in an afternoon a week or
|3o ago . . . and he broke three at
the N.C.A.A. meet at Harvard a week
later, but was behind Jack Medica
every time. . . . There are rumors
that Gilhula may be at the Stanford
Relays a week from Friday.

A REAL 810 MEET
ONCE MORE

1935 may see the fall of Stanford
las champions, but it also brings a
j great revival in track and field in
-1 terest in northern California. The
Big Meet will again be just what
' the name indicate;*. For the past
decade the annual meeting between
Stanford and California has awak
ened little interest: the U.C. follow
i ers accepted defeat as inevitable.
This year the meet may be doped
as a toss-up, witli the victory go
ing to the team producing the
i most come - through athletes.
Stanford will not be overwhelm -
j ing favorites as they have been
for the past ten years; the pre
dictors will give Cal a slight edge,
if anybody.
Beside# a scramble for every place
! between the two teams, the Big
. Meet will bring several outstanding
j individual duels. The opening event
will find CaTs Bob Heavy, sensa
tional sophomore miler, facing Stan
ford's veterans, Warren Dixon and
Chuck Nimmo. Nimmo has run
nearly five seconds faster than
Heavy, but the U.C. ace seems to
be able to run just fast enough to
win. The 14-year-old meet record
j of 4:21 is as good as gone.

HURDLE RACES
WILL BE CLASSIC

In the hurdles Sammy Klopstock,
I the Indians' national champ, will be
I pitted against a great quartet oi'
! Bear stick men, Tom Moore, John
| Wood, Captain Dick Coe, and Del
1 Fishback. Moore, who transferred
j from Sacramento Junior College
I with Wood, has lowered the Ed-
I wards Field high hurdle mark al
most every time he has run.
Just on the side will be sucli
attractions as six 200-foot jrwelin
throwers; George Anderson,
claimed by many as the world's
fastest human, though only a Cal
sophomore; ,and the possibility of
Big Meet records being broken in
a half dozen events.
A sellout is already predicted for
the Edwards Stadium. Just a year
ago 15,000 people wouldn't have
gone to three Big Meets.
SHORTS—
More Stanford men are listed
among the world's record holders
for regular track and field college
events than for any other one or
ganization . . . and more world's
records for the 15 college events
have been made at Palo Alto than
any other place. . . . Coach John
Bunn promised jackets to the In
dian hoopsters if they won two
games on the Midwest trip last De
cember, hence the recent outburst
of red sweaters. . . . Phil Levy
hitch-hiked to the Long Beach re
lays before the vacation and took
second to "Slitiger" Dunn in the
discus with a toss of 157 feet. . . .

Eb Sellers, who won the two-mile
in the Washington - Stanford meet
last week, tried to make the finan
cial ends meet in the Stanford med
school for a couple of quarters.
. . . He's got the best two-mile
mark on the Coast.
Ace of the 1935 track pictures
seen in this region is a recent
Los Angeles Times photo of Bud
Deacon, one of Stanford's "Seven
Avengers" of last year, vaulting
at 14 feet 5 inches. Deacon ip
pears absolutely above the bar,
the photo being taken just as he
was starting down. But the bar
was eventually knocked off, and
another of Deacon's tries at the
world's record, now 14 feet 4%
inches, was lost. Later in the af
ternoon he attempted 14 feet 10
inches, and barely missed again.
U.S.C. has somewhat of a frosh
track team . . . not as good as last

high jump, and Don Skinner, 23-foot

A REAL 810 MEET
ONCE MORE

1935 may see the fall of Stanford
las champions, but it also brings a
j great revival in track and field in
-1 terest in northern California. The
Big Meet will again be just what
' the name indicate;*. For the past
decade the annual meeting between
Stanford and California has awak
ened little interest: the U.C. follow
i ers accepted defeat as inevitable.
This year the meet may be doped
as a toss-up, witli the victory go
ing to the team producing the
i most come - through athletes.
Stanford will not be overwhelm -
j ing favorites as they have been
for the past ten years; the pre
dictors will give Cal a slight edge,
if anybody.
Beside# a scramble for every place
! between the two teams, the Big
. Meet will bring several outstanding
j individual duels. The opening event
will find CaTs Bob Heavy, sensa
tional sophomore miler, facing Stan
ford's veterans, Warren Dixon and
Chuck Nimmo. Nimmo has run
nearly five seconds faster than
Heavy, but the U.C. ace seems to
be able to run just fast enough to
win. The 14-year-old meet record
j of 4:21 is as good as gone.

HURDLE RACES
WILL BE CLASSIC

In the hurdles Sammy Klopstock,
I the Indians' national champ, will be
I pitted against a great quartet oi'
! Bear stick men, Tom Moore, John
| Wood, Captain Dick Coe, and Del
1 Fishback. Moore, who transferred
j from Sacramento Junior College
I with Wood, has lowered the Ed-
I wards Field high hurdle mark al
most every time he has run.
Just on the side will be sucli
attractions as six 200-foot jrwelin
throwers; George Anderson,
claimed by many as the world's
fastest human, though only a Cal
sophomore; ,and the possibility of
Big Meet records being broken in
a half dozen events.
A sellout is already predicted for
the Edwards Stadium. Just a year
ago 15,000 people wouldn't have
gone to three Big Meets.
SHORTS—
More Stanford men are listed
among the world's record holders
for regular track and field college
events than for any other one or
ganization . . . and more world's
records for the 15 college events
have been made at Palo Alto than
any other place. . . . Coach John
Bunn promised jackets to the In
dian hoopsters if they won two
games on the Midwest trip last De
cember, hence the recent outburst
of red sweaters. . . . Phil Levy
hitch-hiked to the Long Beach re
lays before the vacation and took
second to "Slitiger" Dunn in the
discus with a toss of 157 feet. . . .

Eb Sellers, who won the two-mile
in the Washington - Stanford meet
last week, tried to make the finan
cial ends meet in the Stanford med
school for a couple of quarters.
. . . He's got the best two-mile
mark on the Coast.
Ace of the 1935 track pictures
seen in this region is a recent
Los Angeles Times photo of Bud
Deacon, one of Stanford's "Seven
Avengers" of last year, vaulting
at 14 feet 5 inches. Deacon ip
pears absolutely above the bar,
the photo being taken just as he
was starting down. But the bar
was eventually knocked off, and
another of Deacon's tries at the
world's record, now 14 feet 4%
inches, was lost. Later in the af
ternoon he attempted 14 feet 10
inches, and barely missed again.
U.S.C. has somewhat of a frosh
track team . . . not as good as last
year, but with three men who could
place in any college meet in th£
country: Tex Milner, 214-foot jav
elin thrower; Delos Thurber, with
a mark of 6 feet 6 inches in the
high jump, and Don Skinner, 23-foot
10-inches broad jumper. . . . Cap
tain Jimmy Gilhula of the famed
Trojan swimmers broke 16 world's
records in an afternoon a week or
|3o ago . . . and he broke three at
the N.C.A.A. meet at Harvard a week
later, but was behind Jack Medica
every time. . . . There are rumors
that Gilhula may be at the Stanford
Relays a week from Friday.
