# WALTER McNEIL AND SAILBOAT ON LAGUNITA
## Stanfordite Can Navigate Seas; Hits Squalls on Campus Lake 
### RORERT EISENBACH 
Farm boys taking to the sea is old
stuff to marine novelistsâ€” about the
country lad, seized with wanderlust,
who ties a change of underwear to
the head ol pa's cane and sneaks
out over the porch roof one dark
night for a life in the fo'eastie.
But when you change the story
slightly, make the farm, house a
iraternity house, the boy a "larmer '
and a college man to boot, ploughing
through fields of knowledge, not
wheat, you've an idea that Holly
wood scenarists might use. (and
that's no crack).
Wins Prize
Call the boy Walter Carson Mc-
Niel. 'cause he's an A. T. O. and that's
his name. Have him piloting a yacht
across the Pacific with six of his
house brothers in the Biennial
Honolulu Yacht Race, winning sec
ond prize.
Then have him returning to a col
lege named Stanford with no pros
pects except a ten-buck book bill
and a house dance. Naturally, he
borrows a flat-bottomed skimmer

from a friend, 'cause he'sfco in love
with a saivor's life, and*does his
boating on Lake Lagunwa. You
could work in some romance, 100. j
Stuff about taking co-eds sailing, >
and letting the wind do the work.
Walter did.
To Many Upsets
About this time he gets into '
trouble with Lake Lagunitu's life i
guards. He's been sloughing into !
canoes, and has capsized so many
times that the aquatic muscle-men \
have the jitters. Imagine that from ,
a guy who's sailed the high seas, j
'"They've asked me to take the ;
"Gertrude" off Lugunita as a menace j
to legal shipping," Walter com- j
plained today. "And I have respect j
lor those life guards."
Now, minus his "menace," he's j
looking forward to a round-the
world trip this summer with his
house brothers. A.T.O. Bill Manger
stands the cost of the boat. They
plan to ivave at the end ol the quar
ter, hoping to return in time tor
fall quarter registration.
