Sir Baden Powell, the founder of
the Boy Scouts, comes to the Bay !
Region on P'riday, direct from the ,
international Boy Scout Jamboree !
in Australia.
Lord Powell has become almost j
a legendary figure to those who have
read of his work in the cause of
boyhood. While serving as a British |
officer in the Boer War against the '
Dutch, in which he received great !
distinction for .his valor and re
sourcefullness in battle, he found j
himself handicapped for men. He |
thus conceived the idea of urging i
boys to carry messages from po.,t j
to post, as "scouts" organized into j
patrols.
When Baden Powell returned to |
England he carried out his notion j
of scouts and patrols as a method of !
building character in youth, to thus '
organize them in training them in j
useful pursuits, and formed the Boy [
Scouts of England. The organization |
has spread into 58 countries of the !
world, with a membership of many !
millions.
