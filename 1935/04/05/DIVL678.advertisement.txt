Dear people who make Arrow Shirts:
I used to be known as the loneliest man
on East 57th Street. Other fellows had dates
with swell-looking girls. All I did was to
draw pictures of them .... Finally I dis
covered Arrow Mi,toga shirts, S.S.* They looked
great—they fitted great. As a result, look
at me now up there in the picture. See that
blonde clinging to my right arm, and that vision
clutching my left. That'll give you just a rough
idea of how I'm doing. And, my friends, I owe
it all to Arrow Shirts.
Gratefully yours,
Shrunk.
