## 
### john McClelland 
Through the dark nights of torrid
i South Africa 34 years ago, a lone
| British scout silently guided his
1 weary horse. Darkness screened
him from watchful Boer snipers who
guarded the area against attempts of
the English to bring aid to the long
besieged city of Mafeking.
That scout was Harry Maloney,
| now Stanford's minor sports direc
tor, who was carrying a dispatch to
; Colonel Baden-Poweil, commander
of surrounded Mafeking. who to
. morrow will visit the Farm in the
interests of the Boy Scout niove
i inent.
Riding fearfully by night and hid-
I in 8 in the hills by day, Maloney
finally reached Mafeking. Baden
j i-owell received him joytully, for he
brought news that provisions were
on the way for the men who had
been living on starvation rations fen*

I weeks.
Nat since that May day in 1001
has Maloney. ihen a sergeant in
charge of a froop of scouts, seen the
great Boer war hero who is now the
Honorable Lord Baden-Powell,
founder of the Boy Scout movement.
Tomorrow Harry Maloney wiil
meet the hero of Mafeking again.
And again he will be carrying a mes
sage. This time it will not be as a
British scout, but as the first com
mander of the Palo Alto Ameiican
'Legion post the compliments () |
American soldiers to a great British
military man.
When Maloney carried the dis
patch through the enemy lines to
Mafeking.he was a lad in his teens.
The British were handicapped for
men in that conflict and many youths
were called upon to give service as
scouts. From that service of youths,

Baden-Powell conceived the idea of
Boy Scouts. And when he returned
from the Boer War he founded the
movement which has spread around
the world.
Lord Baden-Powell comes to
Stanford tomorrow from the inter
national Boy Scout Jamboree in
Australia. He will be welcomed at
an informal meeting at 10:45 o'clock
in the Women's Clubhouse, which
will be open to all students.
Will the former British Colonel re
call the scout who chtttc riding into
the city he defended in the tumult
ous years of the African conflict
when the two meet again tomorrow
morning? What will be his re
sponse when Harry Maloney delivers
his second "dispatch" 34 years after?
History will he relived in the base
ment of the Women's Clubhouse to
morrow morning.
