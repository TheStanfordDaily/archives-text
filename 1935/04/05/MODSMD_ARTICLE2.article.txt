As the spring quarter gets under
way the big work on the Quad be
gins. There are only about five weeks
in which to gather all the loose ends
before the book goes to press, ac
cording to Ev Moses, editor.
No definite date has been sot for
publication, but it will be sometime
early in June. As only a limited
number are going to be printed there
will be only a few left for last minute
purchasers. All members of the edi
torial staff who have not as yet re
