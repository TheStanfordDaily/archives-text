on hand to attempt a new top, and
j plenty of officials will be present to
j make any new mark official.

| be present are Ed Waterbury in the

| Dunn in the weights. Norm Bright
in the two-mile, and Roy Kirkpatrick

j been invited.
Lyman Imperils Record
Marty will not be the only one
I leaping for a record. Fresno has
Cornelius Warmerdam, who two
: weeks ago cleared 14 feet in the pole
. vault with the greatest of ease, and
: has record intentions.
j Another record to be imperiled
will be the 8-pound shot in which
John Lyman will try to break his
own record of 70 feet and some odd
i inches.
I Making it a three-ring circus will
I be a public address system on the
j field, which will broadcast an event
{ by-event summary of the U.S.C.-
| California meet bting held in Los
{Angeles.
Tickets for the meet, at 25 cents
i each, are still on sale at the A.S.S.U.
j office, and will be obtainable at the

Dink Templeton will marshal hi.s
full force of trackmen tomorrow af
\ ternoon and pit them against a team
; from Fresno State—a team packed
with plenty of class and with vic
j tory in its grasp.
j If all goes well the Cards should
! win, but not without a good argu
! ment from Flint Hanner's boys, who
j are still recuperating from a measles
I plague. Fresno wins loom in the
1 sprints, 880, two-mile, broad jump,
' and pole vault.
Stanford, with Klopstock, Black
| man, Dixon, Smith, Reynolds, Levy,
and Mottram good for nine first
j places right there, should be able to
I rally the necessary 20 points more to
i cinch victory.
Marty to Jump
j In addition to the Fresno-Stanford
I competition, Skull and Snakes has
1 secured promise of some big-time
: added attractions to add to box-office
i appeal and spectator interest.
