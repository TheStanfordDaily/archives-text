SACRAMENTO, April 4 (/P).â€”ln
a sudden surprising move to upset
the verdict which convicted com
munists of conspiracy to violate the
criminal syndicalism act, Defense
Attorney Leo Gallagher introduced
an affidavit from a juror in the Su
perior Court of Judge Dal M. Lem
inon today.
The affidavit, signed by Juror
Howard S. Mclntire, states he did
not believe that two of the defend

however, informed Gallagher that it
would have no effect upon the con
