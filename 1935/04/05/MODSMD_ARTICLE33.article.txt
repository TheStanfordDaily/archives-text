# Sensible Action By the Board of Equalization
## 
### 
The rough heaves a sigh, ;is lie
finds that in I tie future he must travel a lull
mile and a 'half for his glass ol suds. Lau
rel lal ion of .'ll liquor lieenses hy the State
Hoard of Equalization hits Menlo Park a
lusty hlow, and that community once more
finds itself legally hone dry as Stanlord's
Hoard of Trustees emerges vietorious from a
two-year figlit.
The t'niversity had ils troubles in the early
years, when the then villages of Mavlield and
Menlo suddenly were transformed into slum
centers, each a rendezvous for many of Cali
fornia's undesirable element. Sensing the dan
ger of having such collections of resorts id the
very gales of the campus, the administration
naturally fought them.
Conditions were already greatly improved
when prohibition put an end to that fight, and
only a few speakeasies bucked the tide. That
made things easier and drier for Stanford,
and only occasional raids remained to remind
authorities of the old days.
Tlie inauguration of President Roosevelt,
.'5.2 beer, and hard liquor followed each other,
ami once more Stanford had to lake up the
tight to keep her surroundings reasonably
respectable. The danger of re-establishment
of I lie old "skim villages" has always been
great, and the Hoard of Trustees finally ap
pealed to the Supreme Court of the State when
licenses were granted liquor dealers at the
very edge of the campus.
The court's decision is well known. II up
held llie contention of the university that a
mile and a half was a reasonable amount of
desert lo surround the campus, and that the
distance should quite naturally be measured
from the campus boundary, and not from the
administration building, the I'liion Cellar, or
Ihe engineering lab.
The (li I more bill, which would have put
to naught two years of litigation, has been
pigeonholed in committee, and the situation
is once more clarified.
So the rough must go south, young man, or
north exactly one and one-half miles for his
glass of beer: and I lie old familiar haunts may
become creameries, fruit markets, or the like.
Menlo will again suffer a business slump, as
only a few very hardy souls take the bootleg
route to business solvency.
The board's decision, reached through
weeks of careful and intelligent consideration,
deserves commendation. Perhaps the trustees
may find their valiant fight not yet over. Liq
uor interests, ever mindful of the potential
stream of dimes, quarters, and dollars that
may llow from the collective student pocket,
may re-commence their side of the fight.
At any rate, thus far Wednesday's decision
stands, and has a good chance of remaining.
It is just, sensible, and gratifying to those who
place ihc reputation of Stanford and her stu
dents above the desires of a selfish few.

The court's decision is well known. II up

mile and a half was a reasonable amount of
desert lo surround the campus, and that the
distance should quite naturally be measured
from the campus boundary, and not from the
administration building, the I'liion Cellar, or
Ihe engineering lab.

pigeonholed in committee, and the situation
is once more clarified.
So the rough must go south, young man, or
north exactly one and one-half miles for his
glass of beer: and I lie old familiar haunts may

Menlo will again suffer a business slump, as
only a few very hardy souls take the bootleg
route to business solvency.
The board's decision, reached through
weeks of careful and intelligent consideration,
deserves commendation. Perhaps the trustees

At any rate, thus far Wednesday's decision
