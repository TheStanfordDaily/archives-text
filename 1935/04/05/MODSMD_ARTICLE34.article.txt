The annual politic*:il campaign dirty work
began Wednesday al the Fniversity of C.ali
fornisi when Mini institution heard its presi
dential candidates announce their planks.
Should any person imagine that campaign
ing here on the Farm is strenuous, multiply
the number of students hv approximately
three, the number of candidates by almost
four, and some idea of the intensity of the
Berkeley struggle may he ascertained.
I'jloill all corners of Lhe campus come the
candidates. Some represent liberal groups,
some arc the pick of a block of houses, while
others jusl decide to run for lhe Inn of it all.
Platforms are almost as grandiose in their
conception as the regular <Â».().P. ;md Deino
cralic planks when election time comes rolling
Most entertaining feature ol the prelinri

iiiiries: "1 have been called a dirty politician!
but considering the demagogue brought
down from Heaven by Ihe editor of the
forninn, 1 am glad I am a politician."
Not to Ik* outdone by this speech, the cam
pus paper retaliated with remarks concerning
this candidate's speech to the effect that "The
editors of the (Inliforniun do not have over
whelming objections to any of the other six
candidates. Hut to a demagogue from HcU,
they do."
Not many there are who can say with per
fect truth that our modern college is not ample
training ground for entering the political
arena after graduation. With such a perfect
background of caucus meetings, oratorical
outbursts, and counter-accusations, there is
no doubt that some day these very candidates
will evolve into fine couneilmen around some
city hall table.
What goes on at Berkeley is only one small
fraction of college election campaigns on many
eampi. ()i such material are our future states
men born!
