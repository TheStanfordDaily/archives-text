# WE SEE WASHINGTON

### 
(Concluded from yesterday) '
There's another angle to this mushroom growth of
government. There are some 25,000 more federal em
ployes in Washington now than there have 'been during
normal years. Some of them are the major emergency
officials whose names hit the news. But the vast bulk
of them are little stenographers at $1620 a year, littler
typists at $1440, and file clerks at $1260.
Probably most of them have come to Washington
with a glowing vision of the nation's capitol, a city of
Tremendous Activity and Constant Excitement. It's
an adventure, to get away from a small town, and join
the merry-go-round.
But the work is routine and pretty deadly. It's the
, same thing day after day. Some of them get home-sick
and go home. Some of them have stayed, protected by
Civil Service Commission regulations, and grown old
in the harness of minor government work.
The women outnumber the men considerably, ,
•vid the young women employes have a tmigh time,
and the men get pretty uppity. You can telephone
a girl in Washington at 9 in the evening, ask her
to go to a second show, and get mi instant lilting
"yes!" ever the 'phone. She'll meet you breathless,
'in five minutes.
I
But there's a human element in the biggest govern
ment machines. Here's an anonymous note that ac
| companied an official response to a man who was,
officially, denied the aid he sought. He was getting
: $24 a month from SERA. His wife was dead and he
supported three minor children. He lived with his
mother, widow of a Spanish War veteran, wbo received
a small pension. She died, and it was discovered that
| just before her death she had been too feeble to sign
j her pension check, and he had signed it for her—and
got into trouble.
i "Write to your Senator. Here are copies of your let
ter, which you may find useful in presenting your
' case through the intervention of others. This is un
| official and not to be acknowledged, as I am not con
cerned with this matter and am not supposed to take
cognizance of it, much less any action.
"Obscure little clerks get into trouble if they try to
help; they must not see nor hear nor think outside
| their narrow groove."
j Copies of the man's longhand appeal to the govern
ment were sent back to him, neatly typed for use in
urging his appeal on more sympathetic ears.

There's another angle to this mushroom growth of
government. There are some 25,000 more federal em
ployes in Washington now than there have 'been during
normal years. Some of them are the major emergency
officials whose names hit the news. But the vast bulk
of them are little stenographers at $1620 a year, littler
typists at $1440, and file clerks at $1260.
Probably most of them have come to Washington
with a glowing vision of the nation's capitol, a city of
Tremendous Activity and Constant Excitement. It's
an adventure, to get away from a small town, and join
the merry-go-round.
But the work is routine and pretty deadly. It's the
, same thing day after day. Some of them get home-sick
and go home. Some of them have stayed, protected by
Civil Service Commission regulations, and grown old
in the harness of minor government work.
The women outnumber the men considerably, ,
•vid the young women employes have a tmigh time,
and the men get pretty uppity. You can telephone
a girl in Washington at 9 in the evening, ask her
to go to a second show, and get mi instant lilting
"yes!" ever the 'phone. She'll meet you breathless,
'in five minutes.
