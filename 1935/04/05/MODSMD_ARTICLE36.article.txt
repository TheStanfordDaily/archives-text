Now that avocadoes have become low in price, the
cooks have declared a counter-offensive with the in
vigorating fruit on the suffering consumers, and almost
every menu in the eating groups contains avocadoes in
salads, in soups, in desserts. Boiled avocadoes, fried
avocadoes, pickled avocadoes, sliced avocadoes, mashed
avocadoes, whole avocadoes and half avocadoes have
driven down the collective marginal utility of the cam
pus and risen to haunt the dreams of the Stanford's
peace-loving board-payers.
A recent event in connection with the present avo
cado crisis illustrates the subtle workings of Chinese
high finance. Tom (Mr. Tom, Dr. Tom, Senor Tom,
Lilt.D., D.D.S. and purveyor to the D.U. palate) was
dickering with the vegetable man in relation to the
purchase of a number of avocadoes for use in feeding
D.U.'s.
Vegetable man: "Fine fresh avocadoes you like three
for a quarter?"
Tom: "Vellee bum. Down town gettum 10 cen'
apiece. No likee!"
Vegetable man: "O.K. I sellum you four for a
quarter."
Tom: "Sold!"
The deal was consummated. The avocadoes changed
hands, and so have the D.U.'s.
j'l.u want to know all the dirt about the Univer
sity do not eagerly turn at breakfast time to OUR
HASHER SEZ, but go directly to the janitorial forces,
who in their manifold duties are not only the vacuum
cleaners of the campus but philosophers and gentlemen.
There is a particularly erudite scholar who per
forms the evening ablutions upon that cradle of liberal
learning, the History Building, and has achieved wis
dom beyond his years in gleaning bits of knowledge
while pouring oil upon troubled floors.
He is a crusader at heart, and a radical in some
aspects, but he wishes to carry out his reforms within
the existing social order. Two great social questions
particularly bother him: The Honor Code, and the tra
dition of No Smoking on the Quad. For the former he
has nothing but contempt, for the latter nothing but
praise.
Says he: "If I were President of the University, I'd
stop this smoking on the Quad right here and now."
In the first place, Ned would get rid of insurgent pro
fessors who sneak off in their rooms and smoke behind
closed doors. Furthermore, he would create a Reign
of Terror among the students and would send secret
spies among them to ferret out those who have illegal
pauses that refresh.
"You can't tell me there isn't smoldng going on,"
says Nfd. "'Cause I have to sweep out all the butts."
You can't tell Ned, who is a bit cynical about human
nature since he has had to clean up after human nature
for nigh unfo 40 years, that the Honor Code is any
wood. Why, he sees violations going on all the time.
It wa-* only last quarter that he saw one particularly
flagrant (or fragrant) case.
It seems that a girl was taking a make-up extra in
a room which Ned was sporadically cleaning. Every
time that Ned came into the room he noticed that her
skirt was raised a little higher. Ned states that the
Kill had the whole course written on her Iff*, and was
busy copying it off on her paper.
