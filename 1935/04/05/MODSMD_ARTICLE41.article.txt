# BULL SESSION
## CANADIANA 
### 
Up in the Great Northern Woods—
I home of the long pine and the short
.summer—is a dotted line. South of
that line lives a people—the Amer
icans—dedicated to business, which
means happiness. North oi that line
|is a people—the Canadians —dedi-'
! cated to happiness, which means
"business.
I
Except for a slightly lesser en
j thusiasm for the bustle of money
making enterprise, the Canadian is
i but an Anglicized version of the
| American down below. He dresses
; like an American, thinks like an
American, looks like an American,
but drinks somewhat better. In the
words of one Canadian business bar -
on, "Profits is the thing; all else i.
I baloney." With American pride, one
I cannot help but feel that the slogan
was filched from some local bigger
; and better business bureau.
The Canadian liquor situation is
j somewhat bewildering. It was jas
j ier to get Canadian liquor in pre
j repeal America than it is to get
'Canadian liquor in Canada with no
i prohibition. Beer is the only alco
i holic beverage sold by the drink,
j All else is by-the-bottle in state
liquor stores. In order to buy from
! the state you must present almost
|every credential but a birth certifi-
I cate. The Canadians take very little
for granted.
Although the format -of Canadian
newspapers is similar to the accepted
1 American style, the news articles are
I written in a manner inconceivable
to the Ameiican (or Stanford) com
muter, who reads his daily on the
I way to work. Canadian news stories
I ■

actually say something. With a
brulal and refreshing frankness,
they will tell, for example, just what
happened at a debate. If the con
testants were dubs, the papers will
say so. If the debate was a washout,
the story minces no words. The net
result is that, though you never went
to a debate in your life, you know
what happened over and above the
all-important facts that there were
100 people in attendance, that the
audience was pleased, that the meet
ing started at 8 p.m. and adjourned
promptly at 10.
Canadians like Americans are be
.set by the same sort of problems.
They complain of "over-govern
ment." They complain of the lack of
"liberalism." The University of
British Columbia wanted to debate:
"Resolved, that the United States
should annex Canada." Permission
was refused. After some wrangling,
they were permitted to debate: "Re
solved, that Canada should annex
the United States."
Aside from the fact that the Amer
ican "guys" is changed to the Ca
nadian "chaps," "dumb-bell" Lo
"stick," and "doddering idiot" to
! "harmless, meandering old crack
pot"—Canadians are just as we are.
One might almost .say—we are just
as good as the Canadians!
