# R.O.T.C. Holds Official Drill Next Monday
## General Malone to Review Stanford Corps 
### 
Immaculate equipment drawn by
flashy red saddle-blanketed horses
will pass in review Monday after
noon before Major-General Paul B.
Malone, commander of the Ninth
Corps Area with headquarters at San
Francisco, in the annual inspection
of the Stanford R.O.T.C.
Because of conflicting classes it
will be impossible to turn out the en
tire local unit, Col. D. C. Cubbison
of the military faculty explained.
Consequently only one battery, com
prising the regular Monday drill
section which constitutes about a
fourth of the total unit strength, will
participate in the drill and inspec
tion.
Monday's inspection, together
with a more technical inspection
later in the quarter, will form the
basis for determination of the
War Department's efficiency grad
ing of the Stanford R.O.T.C. Last
year, and every other year since
its founding, the unit has been
classified as "excellent," which is
the highest efliciency rating as
signed. I
The main purpose of General Ma
lone's visit is to get acquainted with
the military work here and to look
over the University plant, it was ex
plained. The general will call on
President Wilbur and other univer
sity officials. General Malone has
just recently arrived in San Fran
cisco from eastern duty, so he has
not had an opportunity to visit the
campus.
During the ceremonies Monday,
which will begin at 2:30 o'clock on
the highway polo field, General Ma
lone will present to Herbert Win
free, George O. Wilson, and Rich
ard O. Hails the annual Walter's
awards, donated by Major Herbert D.
Walter, specialist-reserve, of the
Class of '00, which are presented to
the three seniors who have been
most outstanding in military work
here.
