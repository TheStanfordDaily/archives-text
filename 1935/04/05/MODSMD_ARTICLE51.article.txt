# Jurs Attempts Isolation Of Evasive Substance
## 
### 
Busily working behind a complex
barrage of chemical apparatus —
enough to befuddle even the more
technically minded—Peter C. Jurs,
graduate student in chemistry, at
temps to isolate one of the most
evasive substances known to science.
"Plant glucosides when hydro
lyzed," Jurs will tell you, "yield an
aglucone, sapogenin, and a mixture
of saccharides. My problem is this:
to isolate the saponins which will
later be broken down into their con
stituents, sapogenins and saccha
rides, the latter determined quali
tatively and quantitatively."
Quite apparently the meaning of
these remarks it very much less of
a mystery to hnn than is the mere
mention of the words to you and
me. As a matter of fact, Jurs has
made marked progress toward the
goal he has set for himself. But
those technical terms? —you may
ask. So he consents to explain.
The saponins are thought to be a
plant food, occurring in all parts of
plants and on plant life existing
throughout the world, but in Jurs
problem in the roots of the amole,
generally known as the Indian soap
root.
Incidentally, the Indians used
saponins as an effective fish poison.
A small amount of the compound
was placed in a lake or pool and,
the Indians noticed, it would only
be a few hours before all the fish
they needed were floating on the
surface, belly upward.
Jurs has been engrossed in his
problem for the past two years, de
vising his own mbthods of procedure
and carrying on his research as a
continuation of seven or eight years

iof .laboratory work already com
! pleted under the direction of Dr. Carl
Robert Noller.
Several chemists have succeeded
in isolating the sapogenins, but in
; the case of the saponins it is quite
! different. The principal difficulty
I confronting the research worker is
' that saponins are very sensitive to
| excess of heat, consequently they
| have no boiling point, no melting
: point, and but a single characteristic
for recognition.
In a dry powder form, saponins
j are a very violent, sneezing powder.
Jurs noticed this soon enough. They
are toxic to man, he concluded, only
: when injected.
So he works on. Continually add
; ing another step, he hopes, toward
[the ultimate isolation of this strange
I plant compound and the advance
ment of man's knowledge of the
i chemical world about him.

Busily working behind a complex
barrage of chemical apparatus —
enough to befuddle even the more
technically minded—Peter C. Jurs,
graduate student in chemistry, at
temps to isolate one of the most
evasive substances known to science.
"Plant glucosides when hydro
lyzed," Jurs will tell you, "yield an
aglucone, sapogenin, and a mixture
of saccharides. My problem is this:
to isolate the saponins which will
later be broken down into their con
stituents, sapogenins and saccha
rides, the latter determined quali
tatively and quantitatively."
Quite apparently the meaning of
these remarks it very much less of
a mystery to hnn than is the mere
mention of the words to you and
me. As a matter of fact, Jurs has
made marked progress toward the
goal he has set for himself. But
those technical terms? —you may
ask. So he consents to explain.
The saponins are thought to be a
plant food, occurring in all parts of
plants and on plant life existing
throughout the world, but in Jurs
problem in the roots of the amole,
generally known as the Indian soap
root.
Incidentally, the Indians used
saponins as an effective fish poison.
A small amount of the compound
was placed in a lake or pool and,
the Indians noticed, it would only
be a few hours before all the fish
they needed were floating on the
surface, belly upward.
Jurs has been engrossed in his
problem for the past two years, de
vising his own mbthods of procedure
and carrying on his research as a
continuation of seven or eight years

iof .laboratory work already com
! pleted under the direction of Dr. Carl
Robert Noller.

in isolating the sapogenins, but in
