# Chaliapin Discusses American Audiences
## 
### 
Tall, kindly, understanding—that's
Feodor Chaliapin, who Wednesday
i evening sang the closing concert of
j the 1934-35 A.S.S.U. Concert Series.
I In his dressing room after the
j concert he chatted for some minutes
i with a Daily interviewer, gladly an
| swering all questions. Unlike most
j famous artists appearing here, he ac
j tually enjoyed singing in the Pa
vilion. "I like the light," he said,
j "theatres are too dark. I like to see
my audience."
Chaliapin likes American audienc
\ es because they arc so friendly. But
j in recent years, he says, there has
i been too much talk of depression,
j "I hear too much of that," he said.
The famous basso speaks English
j without much accent, but slowly and
(sometimes with awkward sentence
i constructions. When asked if he has
ever sung at a college before, he
I said yes, at—and then he said some
; thing that sounded like "Anahvahd."
j "Harvard?" someone suggested. No,
I that was not it. "Someplace near
[ Detroit," he said. "Oh, Ann Arbor,"
jsaid someone else. That was the

place.
Asked how he liked working in I
pictures (he has just made a film of I
"Don Quixote"), he replied that I
while it was very hard, it was also i
very interesting. When asked if ho j
remembered what company had j
made the film, he replied, "The com- |
puny? I don't remember. That is
not important.- But the leading lady I
—ah!"
