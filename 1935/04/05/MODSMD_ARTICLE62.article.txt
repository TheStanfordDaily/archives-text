## NUMBER "II" CONSPICUOUSLY ABSENT 
### 
When football uniforms were giv
en out to the 1935 Stanford varsity
last night there was one member
of the famed "vowing sophs" who
was conspicuously absent as Stan
ford's greatest grid machine started
preparing for its final season. In
fact, it is not at all certain that the
"1" which has been so prominent
in the last two years will be in at
the usual right tackle position when
the Indians open next fall.
Claude Callaway, according to
the best verified reports, is still
the sick man that he was last
January 1, when he decided to
drop out of school after the Rose
Howl game and get rid of the
bronchitis that bothered him off
and on during the grid season.
The cough hasn't gone away yet.
Some reports are that Callaway's
football clays are over.
Hence the return of Dale Beedle
is particularly gratifying to Stanford
grid enthusiasts. Beedle, who lived
up to a great prep record as cap
tain of the frosh eleven two seasons
ago, is a tackle who would please
any varsity coach. He has power
to spax*e, speed, and above all, a
love for the game. His presence will
distinctly relieve the tension caused
by the absence of Callaway.
