# SKULL AND SNAKES REPEAT TOMORROW
## 
### 
Tomorrow Skull and Snakes re
peat their highly successful 1.C.4-A.
benefit meet of last year. The meet
can't be postponed this time, and
will be surely held if it doesn't rain
Saturday morning, allowing the
managers to do what they can to
get Angell Field into shape.
Last year the all-University
meet produced some of the early
season's best performances, with
Bud Deacon vaulting 14 feet 2%
inches; Walter Marty reaching (!
feet X inches, and barely missing
at (» feet 5) inches; Chuck Nimmo's
mile in 4:22.9; and John Lyman
annexing world's records in the
8- and 24-pound shots.
Tomorrow Norm Bright's 2-mile
is sure to be one of the best recorded
on the Coast since the Olympic
Games. Without competition Bright
has run 17 seconds under the Big
Meet record.
Besides, there's the slight matter
of the Fresno State dual meet
which goes on at the same time.
Some of the dopesters are predict
ing a win for the Fresno squad —
over the national champs.
