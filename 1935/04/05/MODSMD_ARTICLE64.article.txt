# TROJANS VS. BEARS HARD TO DOPE
## 
### 
What will gain the attention of
California track fans tomorrow is
the Bear-Trojan meet in Los An
geles. Wo once had the idea of dop
ing it. Then somebody said, "Yeah,
and who's going to win the hurdles?
Moore, Wood, Cope, Staley, Hall,
Paul?" And we were convinced
that we would get into mischief
enough with the Stanford meets.
We will venture the belief that
the Bears can't do it. Coach Dean
Cromwell has been keeping the Tro
jans under wraps all spring, and
their real strength will not be known
until tomorrow.
