# TINY'S "BRAINSTORMS" PUT TO SPRING PRACTICE TEST
## 
### Gordon Frost 
"Brainstorms" are Tiny Thorn
hill's pet hobbies these days! The
genial Tiny has already begun his
plans for Stanford's 1935 grid ma
chine, in fact those plans have been
under way all winter. Now that
spring practice is here Tiny is put
ting his new ideas to test. He calls
them his "brainstorms."
Last Wednesday when the Indian
coach sent his 77 varsity football as
piranis through their early season
paces, he tried out some of the new
"brainstorms" for the first time.
Three teams were organized, two of
Tiny's newly conceived formations
went on the testing block. Against
the new set-ups Coach Thornhill
pitted two of his old standby forma
tion of last season.
"They're just ideas now," exclaim
ed the burly Card coach, "and they
may never amount to anything," but
the look in his eye gave away the
fact that hopes are high for a forma
tion that will excell the old "double
wingback" of last season.
This year's spring turnout prom
ises to be at least 10 to 15 men bet
ter than last. To date 77 men have
signed for equipment and when
baseball and track release their foot
ball men Tiny expects the ranks to
swell to 90 or 95.
The rumor that Claude Calloway,
two-year first-string tackle, wouid
be unable to return to the .squad next
fall because of illness was uncon
firmed by Thornhill. Cab's close

for his return are slight.
Stan Anderson, whose stellar per- 1
fonnances at half were being
counted on for the '35 season, has
played his full allotted time on the
Indian varsity and is ineligible for
further competition, said Tiny re
gretfully. * 1
