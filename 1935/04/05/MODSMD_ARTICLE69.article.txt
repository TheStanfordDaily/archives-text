## 
### 
Forty men were issued soccer
equipment yesterday. The first
workout will be held Monday, and
' three times a week all quarter.
Coach Harry Maloney was grati-
I fied at the number of lower division
men signing up, and looks forward
j to some real teams in the next few
years. Last year's team was com
posed mostly of sophomores, and the
; added year of competition should
1 boost the win column to a new high.
