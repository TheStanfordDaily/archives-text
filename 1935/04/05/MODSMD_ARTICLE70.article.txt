### 
CHICAGO, April 4 (>P). — The
country's outstanding college bas
ketball coaches came out into the
open with their pet schemes on how
to improve the game today, but
when their quips, sallies, and argu
ments had died away they appeared
to be just where they started—dead
locked.
Clearer interpretations of some
rules were gained, but every im
portant suggestion lor a rule change
crashed into a stone wall of opposi
tion, leading many to believe that
not a single vital change would be
recommended to the national rules
committee, which meets in New
York Sunday and Monday.
Today's battle, centered in a panel
discussion of rules interpretation,
saw the East, led by Nat Holman
oi the City College of New York,
fighting a losing battle against the
rest of the country.
Harold "Ole" Olsen, Ohio State
coach, was chairman of the panel
discussion. With him on the plat
form were Coaches J. W. St. Clair,
Southern Methodist; Zard Lam
bert, Purdue; Phog Allen, Kansas;
Doc Carlson, Pittsburgh, who dia
grammed screening plays; John
Bunn, Stanford; Lon Jourdette,
Pennsylvania, and Adolph Rupp,
Kentucky.
Bunn took up the proposal to re
duce the use of the center jump.
The four southern teams of the Pa
cific Coast Conference experimented
last season with the plan to reduce
the use of the center jump by auto
matically giving the ball to the team
just scored upon, he said, with ex
ceptional results.
