# Frosh Tennis Squad Rests This Week-end
## 
### 
Stanford's freshman tennis squad
wilt rest this week-end and prepare
itself for Berkeley High a week from
Saturday, the strong California
freshmen on the 20th, and sandwich
a match with Modesto Junior Col
lege somewhere between these two
dates.
The yearling raquet-wieldei's are
expecting little opposition from the
Berkeley High team, but will take
the Bear freshman match a little
more seriously.
