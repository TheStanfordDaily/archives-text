# INDIAN BALL NINE WILL MEET BEARS IN SERIES OPENER
## Anderson and Morgan Will Form Card Battery 
### 
Old Sol having apparently won a
preliminary engagement with Jup
Pluvius, veteran snlif-ball artist,
the varsity nines of Stanford and
California can now go on with the
main event. The Sunken Diamond
will be ths site for this first game of
the annual Big Series, and 3:15 the
time.
Stan Anderson and "Lefty"
Hardt or Joe Gallison will furnish
the opposing swatsmiths with a va
ried assortment of cur ves. Oct Mor
gan will be behind the plate for
the Indians, with Arleigh Williams
of football fame doing the catching
for the Bears.
Coach Harry Wolter will again
use the line-up that started the last
Trojan game. These men, Leidig,
Herringer, and Hamilton in the out
field, and Mallatratt, Turner, Clark,
and Tremaine in the infield have
looked better in practice lately than
at any time this season.
Tremaine Improves
Especially worthy of note is the
improvement of Frank Tremaine,
who is rapidly regaining his last
year's form. Clark is still erratic in
his maneuvers around the short
patch, but has it in him to play a
great fielding" game. His hitting was
potent against the Trojans.
The biggest question mark in the
infield is Howell Turner. With only
two weeks of actual training, he can
hardly be expected to hit well, but
if his fielding holds up, he at least
won't be a drawback.
Anderson has not shown the form
this season that he displayed a year
ago, but with any kind of support
from his mates should be able to
subdue the Bears.
Three-Way Fight
This year's Blue and Gold team
has not been as consistent as some,
and must fight every minute to win.
With a chance to overtake the league
leading Bruins, the Bears should be
hustling every minute. If the In
dians pull an upset, it may throw
the league into a three-way fight be
tween California, U.C.L.A., and
Santa Clara.
Anyone can see that Stanford's
chances rest on a flock of ifs, but
the beauty of baseball is that any
thing can happen, and the Indians
are a fighting, hustling dub. If they
play the kind of ball they are cap
able of, then the customers will be
treated to some fancy baseball. If
they don't, it'll be a sad, sad story,.
