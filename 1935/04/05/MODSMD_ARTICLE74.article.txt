# GAUD POLOISTS WILL MEET UTAH
## 
### 
Stanford poloists, mythical cham
pions of the West last year, will in
augurate intercollegiate competi
tion on the campus (his year when
they meet an unknown University of
Utath quartet in a two-game series
on Wednesday and Friday.
The games, which will offer local
polo fans their first opportunity this
season of witnessing intercollegiate
polo here, will get underway at 3
o'clock on the highway polo field.
Nothing is known definitely con
cerning the ability of the visiting
mallet- wi elders, according to Lt.
Haydon Y. Grubbs, Card coach, but
it is rumored that the Utah men
will give (he redshirts a busy set of
afternoons. Two top-notch contests
should result.
The Card quartet has been greatly
strengthened by the return of the
veteran No. 3, Russ Rasmussen, this
quarter. His absence from the line
up last quarter weakened the In
dian offense. Lt. Grubbs announced
that his starting combination will
find Carl Beal in No. 1 position,
Captain Bill Rogers at No. 2. Russ
Rasmussen at No. 3, and Bob Fuller
ton at No. 4. Bill Enemark, Jim
Hendei jion, John Dwyer, and Ed
McKeon will probably see service
in the series as able substitutes..
Rogers, Rasmussen, and Fullerton
were all first-string regulars on last
season's powerful aggregation.
The Utah men are scheduled to
arrive on Tuesday and they will be
. ccommodatcd at various houses on
...o campus. The visitors are coach
i i by Lt. R. M. Cannon.
In order to make the assignment
( mounts as fair as possible, as th?
al stables will have to mount the
\ itors, it is planned to have a di
rect change of the strings of horses
at half time, Lt. Grubbs said.
