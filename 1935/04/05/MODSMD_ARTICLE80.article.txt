# BRUIN NETMEN TO FACE INDIANS IN IMPORTANT MATCH
## Lockwood's Team Hopes To Repeat First Win 
### 
Leading in the race for the Pa
cific Coast Conference, Stanford's
varsity netmen will clash with the
Bruins of U.C.L.A. at 1:30 o'clock
tomorrow on the Farm courts. Hav
ing aheady trounced the Uclans 8-1.
Sherman Lockwood's powerful
squad is heavily favored to repeat.
Several of last week's sets were
quite close, and a reversal of form
I on the part of the Bruins, who were
■ not up to par at that time, could
I make things hot for the Indians.
Lee Is Favored
Because of his strong staying qual
' ities, Captain Sammy Lee is a good
bet to repeat his narrow victory over
U.C.L.A.'s Stan Biiggs in the fea
j ture event. The second and third
singles matches, in which Stanford's
i Johnny Law will play Frank Stew
• art, and Bill Seward will try to even
the score with George Bidwell of
U.C.L.A., may provide even better
J competition.
i Ben Dey, Juek Lynch, and Bob
Pommer have excellent chances to
threaten the ladder positions and
team rankings of Lee, Law, and
Seward by showing to advantage
i against the Uclans. The three doub
les team of Lee-Pommer, Dey
| Seward, and Law-Lynch rate prac
tically on a par. but all may have
[trouble with improved Bruin com
i binations.
Junior Varsity Plays
The Stanford junior varsity will
rate a decided edge in its matches
with the San Francisco State Teach
ers' College netmen, scheduled fot
10 o'clock tomorrow morning, on the
varsity courts.
Dan Clark and Bob Helmholz, Bob
iLilienthal and Jack Downey, and

Burnett Mason and Bob Hall have
been picked as members of the ten
tative line-up for both the singles
and the doubles matches. Admis
sion to the varsity and junior var
sity matches tomorrow will be free.

There are far more women in Cali
fornia and the Southwest than men.
