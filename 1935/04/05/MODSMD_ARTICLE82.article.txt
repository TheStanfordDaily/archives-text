proposal.
The answers have been promised

board, announced here as he urged
those involved in the controversy to
be patient.
Plan Under Consideration
Rosenshine stated the truce plan,
the nature of which he did not dis
close, has been under consideration
by the sailors' union and tank ship
owners for the last 48 hours.
The proposal if accepted, Rosen
shine said, would end the strike
which has paralyzed oil shipments
for several weeks and would serve
as a basis for arbitration of the dis
pute.
Sailors Picket Waterfront
Striking sailors, whose principal
demand is for preferential employ
ment of union members, continued
meanwhile to picket waterfronts.
Violence was reported at Rich
mond, San Francisco Bay point,

a tank ship, informed police he had
been followed to his home and beat
