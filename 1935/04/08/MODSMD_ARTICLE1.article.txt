# KINGFISH LONG HELD 'TOM-TIT' BY LEGISLATOR
## "Small Bird with Big Ideas" Definition of Cowboy Representative GASSAWAY HAS 'PLAN' Would Print Free Money For All; No Work 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 7
lahoma's cowboy congressman —
Representative Percy L. Gassaway—
tonight christened Senator Huey P.
Long a "political tom-tit" and a
"militia-ized dictator," then .sug
gested a substitute for his "share
the-wealth" program.
The high-heel booted, 10-gallon
hatted southwesterner gave in his
prepared radio speech this defini
tion of a "tom-tit."
Imitates Woodpecker
"It is a very small bird that tries
to imitate a woodpecker. It will at
tack the biggest tree in the forest—
just like the Kingfish is attacking
President Roosevelt—and after ham
mering away vigorously for a while
it flies around the tree to see-if it
has knocked it down or pecked a
hole in it."
Whereupon Gassaway satirically
unfolded his own scheme of starting
the printing presses and giving
everybody as much money as the
richest man in the world has.
No Need for Schools
Then, he contended, there would
be no need for schools because no
body would have to learn to work;
no need for preachers because the i
search for the "root of all evil" j
would end. "Foreigners" could be |
hired to do the work, he said, con- j
tinuing:
"You know, in my honest opinion, j
Communists, Fascists, 'Pretty Boy' j
Floyds, Dillingers, and Barrowses J
are Sunday school boys compared j
to a man who hides behind the j
cloak of immunity granted by high j
office and preys upon the innocence
and ignorance of the unsuspecting."
