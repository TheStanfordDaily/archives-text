# YOUTHS ASLEEP CLAIMS GURRY IN 'Y' SEMINAR
## Present Generation Accepts World Too Casually, Lecturer Believes 
### Barbara Rosenblatt 
Declaring that the present genera
lion is now relatively asleep, and
unaware of the world around it, Dr.
Bruce Curry opened a three-day
seminar on "Religion and Social
Change" last night in the Women's
Clubhouse.
| "This world, which we accept so
i casually, should stir the imagination
and thinking of all of us, especially
j students," Dr. Curry claimed.
Fvjc New Demands
i Due to the breakdown of our so
| cial institutions — the school, the
j church, the state, and ihe family—
j we are facing new demands which
j must be met squarely. These insti
i tut ions as we have them now were
fitted for the needs of 50 or 100
years ago, and must undergo drastic
changes if they are to be suitable for
present-day needs.
The Hinily as it was known a
ccntury ago has broken down un
til it no longer has a meaning of
unity and sanctity. Economic
pressure within the family, mis
understanding between genera
tions, and the school systems have
caused the decay of what was for
merly the best of our national
characteristics. x
Of education, Dr. Curry says, "The
quality and content of education
j must be profoundly changed." He
is amazed at the optimism of college
: students in the face of "the tremen-
I dous problems of present-day life.
! It is Dr. Curry's belief that we have
j turned out specialized, skilled men
I for too long. There is now no room
j lor the hundreds that are being
j turned out of colleges every year,
j trained merely for a narrow job.
Discusses Religion
In spite of the pessimistic views
which have come about because of
| the breakdown of our systems, Dr.
Curry says, "There is a core of cul-
J tural value which may be pre
served."
But in order to preserve this core
and build upon it, we must turn to
the spiritual frontier. We have al
ready conquered the material and
physical frontiers; unless we face the
spiritual frontier, we will have noth
ing big enough to live i'or, nothing
left to die for.
When confronted by this problem,'
people invariably ask two questions
—"Can educated people accept re
ligion?"' and "Is religion neces
sary?" Dr. Curry believes that edu
cated people can accept religion, if
it is high, or good, religion, follow
ing the principles of Christ or of
their respective God. And if we are
to change and progress, high relig
ion is necessary.
Dr. Curry says that no matter
what one's belief is, whatever one
depends on in the last analysis be
comes one's God.
Fallowing Dr. Curry's talk an
open forum was held, which will be
continued at the Monday and Tues
day sessions, to be held in the Little
Theatre at 4:15 o'clock.

day sessions, to be held in the Little
Theatre at 4:15 o'clock.
Declaring that the present genera
lion is now relatively asleep, and
unaware of the world around it, Dr.
Bruce Curry opened a three-day
seminar on "Religion and Social
Change" last night in the Women's
Clubhouse.
| "This world, which we accept so
i casually, should stir the imagination
and thinking of all of us, especially
j students," Dr. Curry claimed.
Fvjc New Demands
i Due to the breakdown of our so
| cial institutions — the school, the
j church, the state, and ihe family—
j we are facing new demands which
j must be met squarely. These insti
i tut ions as we have them now were
fitted for the needs of 50 or 100
years ago, and must undergo drastic
changes if they are to be suitable for
present-day needs.
The Hinily as it was known a
ccntury ago has broken down un
til it no longer has a meaning of
unity and sanctity. Economic
pressure within the family, mis
understanding between genera
tions, and the school systems have
caused the decay of what was for
merly the best of our national
characteristics. x
Of education, Dr. Curry says, "The
quality and content of education
j must be profoundly changed." He
is amazed at the optimism of college
: students in the face of "the tremen-
I dous problems of present-day life.
! It is Dr. Curry's belief that we have
j turned out specialized, skilled men
I for too long. There is now no room
j lor the hundreds that are being
j turned out of colleges every year,
j trained merely for a narrow job.
Discusses Religion
In spite of the pessimistic views
which have come about because of
| the breakdown of our systems, Dr.
Curry says, "There is a core of cul-
J tural value which may be pre
served."
But in order to preserve this core
and build upon it, we must turn to
the spiritual frontier. We have al
ready conquered the material and
physical frontiers; unless we face the
spiritual frontier, we will have noth
ing big enough to live i'or, nothing
left to die for.
When confronted by this problem,'
people invariably ask two questions
—"Can educated people accept re
ligion?"' and "Is religion neces
sary?" Dr. Curry believes that edu
cated people can accept religion, if
it is high, or good, religion, follow
ing the principles of Christ or of
their respective God. And if we are
to change and progress, high relig
ion is necessary.
Dr. Curry says that no matter
what one's belief is, whatever one
depends on in the last analysis be
comes one's God.
Fallowing Dr. Curry's talk an
open forum was held, which will be
continued at the Monday and Tues
day sessions, to be held in the Little
Theatre at 4:15 o'clock.
