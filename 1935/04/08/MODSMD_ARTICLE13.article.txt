## 
### 
NEWARK. N.J., April 7 W').-Two
home runs by Babe Ruth enabled the
Boston Braves of the National
League to defeat the Newark Bears,
champions of the International
League, 10 to 8 today.
Ruth's first home run came in his
first appearance at the plate. It was
a hard line drive into the right field
bleachers. The second in the sixth
inning started the Braves on a hit
ting spree which netted seven runs.
This second homer was the longest
ever made at the local park, an at
tendant said.
