## 
### 
Where in the dickens is Peggy H.
of Los Altos? Campus Sheriff -Fred
Frehe would like to know. He is
convinced that she is not at the bot
tom of Lake Lagunita, despite the
fact that a suicide note signed with
her first name and initial was found
pinned to a fcnce bordering the lake
early Friday morning.
After spending an exhausting
afternoon' in the lake rowboat, pok
ing into old shoes and ford fenders
in i:n attempt to recover the "body,"
he is beginning to think the whole
affair is phony. Registrar's records
reveal no co-ed whose name could
be Peggy H.. and county authorities
have located only one person living
in Los Altos whose initial fit. She is
Miss Peggy Hill, Palo Alto high
school student, who is very much
alive.
