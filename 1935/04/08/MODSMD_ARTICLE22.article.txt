America possesses more essential
war materials within its borders
than any other nation on the face of
the earth, stated Dean Theodore J.
Hoover, in an interview yesterday
for the Associated Press. He named
manganese, tin, antimony and silk
as the principle raw materials need
ed in war not found abundrmtly
within the borders of Up'ted States.
"Fifty thousand acre* planted to
the guayule, which wi'l flourish in
Texas and California, would give us
after 10 years a large supply of rub
ber at law cost," stated the dean,
"and thereby make America inde
pendent of foreign shipments of this
vital war material."
