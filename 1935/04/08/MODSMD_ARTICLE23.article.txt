# Officials Set Benefit Track Meet May 25
## Plan All-University Affair For Third Time 
### 
1.C.4-A. Benefit Meet officials,
somewhat disheartened over the
twice postponed affair, last night an
nounced that May 25 has been set as
the new date with hopes ihat weather
conditions would "find the track
men a break."
Originally scheduled for a month
ago, March {), the meet was post
poned because of poor weather
conditions and April (5, last Satur
day, set as the new date.
Then Old Main Rain again turned
Angell Field into a sea of mud, and
Skull and Snakes, men's honorary
athletic fraternity sponsoring the
meet, was forced to make a second
postponement.
It was unanimously agreed that in
fairness to athletes of such calibre
as Eastman, Blackman, Marty,
Bright, and Nimmo a fast, dry track
should be the prime requisite of the
meet.
Officials will reinvite all the ac
cepting athletes with the hope that
the old adage "three is a charm"
will hold true and bring Old Sol out
for the benefit next month.
