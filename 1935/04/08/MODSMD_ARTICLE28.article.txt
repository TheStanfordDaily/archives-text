VIENNA, April 7 (A y ). — Ail the
armed forces of Austria paraded to
| day in the first show of military
I strength since the official announce
ment April 3 of the government's in
tention to rearm.
The principal display was con
fined to this one-time imperial city.
The entire Vienna garrison passed in
review before members of the gov
ernment and (he veteran Archduke
Eugene of the Hapsburgs.
Air Demonstration
A squadron of 16 planes, seven of
military type, flying in close forma
tion, roared overhead and excited
curiosity as to Austria's probable air
strength. Upwards of 100 trained
air pilots also marched, but not as
a separate formation, being scat
tered among the infantry and artil
lery regiments to which they are
nominally attached.
Refers to Past
Archduke Eugene, former field
marshal-in the imperial army and
the highest ranking representative
of the former imperial dynasty, now
in Vienna, was the dominant figure
in the display.
Chancellor Schuschnigg briefly
addressed the soldiers gathered in
historic Heldenplatz. Alluding to the
imperial martial memories of this
one-time center of Hapsburg glory,
he explained to the troops:
"Now, as in the past, it can be
said of you—in your camp is Aus
tria!"
When the Archduke Eugene parsed
by the crowd was silent—whether
because of indifference, hostility or
realization of Ihe implication of
Europe's wave of rearmament re
mained unclear.
