# Dr. Ralph Curry Discourses On A Timely Subject
## 
### 
Dr. Hruce Curry last nighl opened a scries
of discussions on "Social Change and Kcligion"
before a crowded audience in I lie Women's
clubhouse.
Speaking with a well fortified background
Â«>!' training in social and religious lields, Dr.
Curry justifies his reputation of being ;i com
pelling and sympathetic speaker. His lour
ol' American ciunpi, holding discussions and
awakening student interest in a phase ol prob-
Icins that are all too often shunted those of
religion in a changing order is eminently
worthwhile.
"The most impressive tiling about college
students today" says Dr. Curry, "is their
naive attitude." Without going into details,
be is probably right. In his wanderings over
the country during the last two months, Dr.
(lurry has met thousands of students and lias
felt them out on a multitude of subjects. He
is well qualified to judge the aggregate mind
of the university student in this country.
With an emphasis on being practical in
everyday life, and a disregard of the notion
thai the country needs more ami more skilled
workers, Dr. Curry makes the observation that
students are great exploiters, going into every
thing with the question "What can I gel out
of it?"
Today and torn morrow concludes the series
of lectures. They are interesting to every
campus student, liberal or conservative, re
ligious or merely "skeptical."
