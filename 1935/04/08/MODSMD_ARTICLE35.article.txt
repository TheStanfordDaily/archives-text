## PELAGIC SEALING—BAILEY 
### CEDRIC LARSON 
Of all the stormy issues which have played havoc
with American-Japanese amity, one of the most vexa
tious was that of stopping Japanese pelagic sealers,
us well as Canadians, from the wanton extermination
of the valuable American fur-bearing seal herds of
the North Pacific.
In 1935—twenty-four years after an agreement was
consummated between Pacific powers ,to end pelagic
sealing, only after President Taft dramatically cabled
a personal appeal to none other than a lineal descend
ant of the sun, the Japanese emperor—it.is gratifying
to note in the new :1934 report of Governor John W.
Troy of Alaska the present flourishing stale of the'fur
seal herds.
From a dwindling 100,00(3 fur-seals in 1911, the
Piibilol Island herds of today have increased to 1,300,-
000. The American government has erected a plant
and equipment worth $900,000 on the PribiJofs for
fin-seal service. In 1034 fur-seal skins inumbering
28,000 netted $575,000 in sales.
It must not he supposed, iltowover, ithat Uic
present happy state of ail'airs lias always existed.
Behind present conditions oil .the'Pril>iltifs:lie otic
of the most spectacular .if isokMetl chapters in the
history of American foreign diplomacy. America
was on the verge of exchanging blows with her
neighbors on several occasions, before '.the Gorxlian
knot of pelagic sealing was cut.
Dr. Thomas A. Bailey, professor of history,, points
out in a new study the heroic--fight waged by the
American department of state for the protection of
these valuable animals.
In 1867 when the United States purchased th€*
"Polar Bear Garden" of Alaska, as it was then called,
for $7,200,000, the magnificent American fur-seal herd
on the Pribilof Islands—two rookeries north of :the
Aleutian chain in the Bering 4,000,000.
Killing -Swimming Seals
Sealing operations normally were conducted on
land, and since the .'fur-bearing seal is highly polyga
mous, it was an easy matter to single out the super
fluous males, and leave about one male in a hundred
for the propagation of the herd. During 1881 or 1882
pelagic sealing—the killing of the seal while swimming
or floating in the water—was introduced, a practice
which killed indiscriminately males . and females .in
alarming numbers. The problem was greatly compli
cated by the fact that these fur seals, among the mast
beuutifu lof wild creatures, ranged the seas for hun
dreds of miles.
American officials first caused pelagic sealing to be
the nemesis of the state department when they seized
Canadian sealing boats on the high seas and brought
vigorous protests from the British Foreign Offiee.
Negotiations of the 1890's proved futile, however, the
herds continuing to dwindle.
Wholesale Butchery
The wholesale butchery was hastened when Japan
offered a bounty on the animal to encourage a lucra
tive industry. In 1906 American officials killed five
Japanese poachers on the Pribi-lofs and caused a dis
tinctly unpleasant incident to arise between Japan and
the United States. Skillful diplomacy fortunately pre
vented an open rupture between the two nations.
Japan, flushed with her victory over the ponderous
Russian bear, was scarcely disposed to part with so
profitable business without compensation. After six
years of continual diplomatic bargaining, Japan, the
United States, Russian and fereat Britain finally signed
in 1911 at Washington a convention prohibiting pelagic
sealing, only after Taft's previously mentioned message
to the Nipponese emperor.
The American fur-seal herd h/yl now been re
duced to 100,000 animals, hut under the new gov
ernment monopoly, the herd began to multiply.
Between 191K and 1930, after subtracting annual
payments to Canada and Japan, .'the United States
government received a tot.-\l revenue of $4,477,000
from the seal herd, and the annual catch will in the
future probably average 100,000.
"It would not be an exaggeration to say that the
North Pacific Sealing Convention of 1911 was a major
victory in the struggle for the conservation of natural
resources, a signal triumph for diplomacy, and a land
mark in the history of international co-operation,"
states Dr. Bailey.

knot of pelagic sealing was cut.
Dr. Thomas A. Bailey, professor of history,, points
out in a new study the heroic--fight waged by the
American department of state for the protection of
these valuable animals.
In 1867 when the United States purchased th€*
"Polar Bear Garden" of Alaska, as it was then called,
for $7,200,000, the magnificent American fur-seal herd
on the Pribilof Islands—two rookeries north of :the
Aleutian chain in the Bering 4,000,000.
Killing -Swimming Seals
Sealing operations normally were conducted on
land, and since the .'fur-bearing seal is highly polyga
mous, it was an easy matter to single out the super
fluous males, and leave about one male in a hundred
for the propagation of the herd. During 1881 or 1882
pelagic sealing—the killing of the seal while swimming
or floating in the water—was introduced, a practice
which killed indiscriminately males . and females .in
alarming numbers. The problem was greatly compli
cated by the fact that these fur seals, among the mast
beuutifu lof wild creatures, ranged the seas for hun
dreds of miles.
American officials first caused pelagic sealing to be
the nemesis of the state department when they seized
Canadian sealing boats on the high seas and brought
vigorous protests from the British Foreign Offiee.
Negotiations of the 1890's proved futile, however, the
herds continuing to dwindle.
Wholesale Butchery
The wholesale butchery was hastened when Japan
offered a bounty on the animal to encourage a lucra
tive industry. In 1906 American officials killed five
Japanese poachers on the Pribi-lofs and caused a dis
tinctly unpleasant incident to arise between Japan and
the United States. Skillful diplomacy fortunately pre
vented an open rupture between the two nations.
Japan, flushed with her victory over the ponderous
Russian bear, was scarcely disposed to part with so
profitable business without compensation. After six
years of continual diplomatic bargaining, Japan, the
United States, Russian and fereat Britain finally signed
in 1911 at Washington a convention prohibiting pelagic
sealing, only after Taft's previously mentioned message
to the Nipponese emperor.
The American fur-seal herd h/yl now been re
duced to 100,000 animals, hut under the new gov
ernment monopoly, the herd began to multiply.
Between 191K and 1930, after subtracting annual
payments to Canada and Japan, .'the United States
government received a tot.-\l revenue of $4,477,000
from the seal herd, and the annual catch will in the
future probably average 100,000.
"It would not be an exaggeration to say that the
North Pacific Sealing Convention of 1911 was a major
victory in the struggle for the conservation of natural
resources, a signal triumph for diplomacy, and a land
mark in the history of international co-operation,"
states Dr. Bailey.
Of all the stormy issues which have played havoc
with American-Japanese amity, one of the most vexa
tious was that of stopping Japanese pelagic sealers,
us well as Canadians, from the wanton extermination
of the valuable American fur-bearing seal herds of
the North Pacific.
In 1935—twenty-four years after an agreement was
consummated between Pacific powers ,to end pelagic
sealing, only after President Taft dramatically cabled
a personal appeal to none other than a lineal descend
ant of the sun, the Japanese emperor—it.is gratifying

was on the verge of exchanging blows with her
neighbors on several occasions, before '.the Gorxlian
knot of pelagic sealing was cut.
Dr. Thomas A. Bailey, professor of history,, points
out in a new study the heroic--fight waged by the
American department of state for the protection of
these valuable animals.
In 1867 when the United States purchased th€*
"Polar Bear Garden" of Alaska, as it was then called,
for $7,200,000, the magnificent American fur-seal herd
on the Pribilof Islands—two rookeries north of :the
Aleutian chain in the Bering 4,000,000.
Killing -Swimming Seals
Sealing operations normally were conducted on
land, and since the .'fur-bearing seal is highly polyga
mous, it was an easy matter to single out the super
fluous males, and leave about one male in a hundred
for the propagation of the herd. During 1881 or 1882
pelagic sealing—the killing of the seal while swimming
or floating in the water—was introduced, a practice
which killed indiscriminately males . and females .in
alarming numbers. The problem was greatly compli
cated by the fact that these fur seals, among the mast
beuutifu lof wild creatures, ranged the seas for hun
dreds of miles.
American officials first caused pelagic sealing to be
the nemesis of the state department when they seized
Canadian sealing boats on the high seas and brought
vigorous protests from the British Foreign Offiee.
Negotiations of the 1890's proved futile, however, the
herds continuing to dwindle.
Wholesale Butchery
The wholesale butchery was hastened when Japan
offered a bounty on the animal to encourage a lucra
tive industry. In 1906 American officials killed five
Japanese poachers on the Pribi-lofs and caused a dis
tinctly unpleasant incident to arise between Japan and
the United States. Skillful diplomacy fortunately pre
vented an open rupture between the two nations.
Japan, flushed with her victory over the ponderous
Russian bear, was scarcely disposed to part with so
profitable business without compensation. After six
years of continual diplomatic bargaining, Japan, the
United States, Russian and fereat Britain finally signed
in 1911 at Washington a convention prohibiting pelagic
sealing, only after Taft's previously mentioned message
to the Nipponese emperor.
The American fur-seal herd h/yl now been re
duced to 100,000 animals, hut under the new gov
ernment monopoly, the herd began to multiply.
Between 191K and 1930, after subtracting annual
payments to Canada and Japan, .'the United States
government received a tot.-\l revenue of $4,477,000
from the seal herd, and the annual catch will in the
future probably average 100,000.
"It would not be an exaggeration to say that the
North Pacific Sealing Convention of 1911 was a major
victory in the struggle for the conservation of natural
resources, a signal triumph for diplomacy, and a land
mark in the history of international co-operation,"
states Dr. Bailey.
