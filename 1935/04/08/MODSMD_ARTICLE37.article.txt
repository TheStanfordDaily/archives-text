# TEARING UP VERSAILLES—WHAT NEXT?
## 
### 
BOSTON, April 7. —A lot of water has passed under
the bridge of .European diplomacy in the last month.
Continuing to do the impossible Hitler proceeded to
tear up the Versailles Treaty in front of the very eyes
of an alarmed Europe. How did he do it? Simply by
announcing Germany's intention to re-arm to the hilt
and to do it as quickly a.s possible.
It has of course long been known that Germany
was well armed—far in excess of what the peace
treaties allowed her. But most of the former allies
were astounded when news of Hitler's actual demands
made to the British envoys leaked out.
Briefly he wanted to make Germany just what she
was before the war—the strongest military power in
Europe. Apparently the Realmlanders demanded in
the plainest terms an army as big as Russia's, which
is the biggest, and an air force the equal of Britain's
and France's, also the biggest. This would mean an
army of about a million men and 4500 planes. What
is more nobody doubts Hitler's ability to do these
things and to do them within a year.
Hitler also demanded a navy as big as France's,
union with Austria and the return of over three
million German-speaking Czechs nJong with the
territory they occupy. Except for asking the re
turn of Alsace-Lorraince and parts of Poland,
'Denmark and Lithuania, these demands amounted
to a complete scrapping of the peace treaties as
far as Germ*viy is concerned. Now what's going to
happen?
In spite of economic troubles Germany is alert and
confident. Militarism is on the march again and her
people are once more living in the days of Bismarck
and Kaiser Bill. So far Hitler's policy of taking his
enemies by surprise has run rings around them. At
present he is still trying to drive a wedge between the
rapidly forming alliance against him.
So the result of Hitler's work just now seems to be
the centering of German effort on the perfecting of
the German army and ihe centering of the former
"Allies" attention on the perfecting of their union
against Germany. The reason for delay in both is
simple. Germany Ls weak financially while the pro
posed coalition is weak politically.
As time goes by the choices before Europe are be
coming clearer. Germany wants a dominant position
again. If the former allies want to grant thus, the
map of Europe will have to be redrawn—in the way
Germany wants it done. On the other hand, if the
allies want to prevent this, they will have to band
together and be prepared to fight to keep Hitler from
realizing his dreams.
Tomorrow: On the Eve of Stroma.
