# BULL SESSION
## HONOR SYSTEM VS. SPONSOR SYSTEM 
### 
After two rough - and - tumble
quarters in Encina Hall, a freshman
Campus Opines that sponsors belong
more properly in a zoo than in the
home of the Stanford frosh. Some
there are who will say that it is only
on a misinterpretation of Webster
that "zoo" and "Encina" can be
spoken of as separate entities. Some
will sympathize with the freshmen
—hounded, spied on, sentenced to
\he Convalescent Home. Others will
defend the sponsors—badgered, be
| deviled, attempting to remain sane
in a 20th century bedlam.
Freshmen at Stanford are faced
with a fundamental paradox in at
tempting to regulate their mode of
conduct. In their living quarters,
they are treated as suspects—fuli of
criminal desire. In their examination
rooms they are suddenly turned
loose to develop a sense of honor.
The ethical conflict between SPON
SOR SYSTEM on the one hand, and
HONOR SYSTEM on the other is not
easy to digest.
, When a newcomer to Stanford
j starts life on Encina beds and beans,
he is explained the details of the
sponsor system. The sponsors are
men who have "been through the
mill"; they are here "to help you"';
and they are here to send you up the
creek to the Home if you get caught
tossing water-bags. The body of
sponsors, in short, is a cross between
the Salvation Army and the OGPU.
But in the quiz rooms, the hortnr
system holds sway—or at least
sways. The freshman is told that
every man is on his honor to do the
! right thing, and that Stanford men
| and women do the right thing. The
j freshman is told that it has been
I found silly to attempt a proctor sys
| tem in examination rooms—for then
I an examination becomes a game of

| hide-and-seek between student and
i professor. The freshman may ac
cept that for a short while, but when
he gets back to Encina, he begins to
wonder why hide-and-seek is all
right for Encina, and not for the
the SPONSOR SYSTEM and the
i classroom. He begins to think that
HONR SYSTEM cannot both be
light— at least not at the same time.
j
If the powers-that-be sincerely
believe that Stanford freshmen and
Stanford students in general may be
trusted with the examination honor
system, it would only seem logical
that the sponsor system should be
junked. If the students are really
quite trustworthy there is no need
for this silly policing business.
On the other hand, if it is found
that Stanford freshmen and Stanford
I students in general only refrain
' from misconduct when they are
I ' watched" — it would seem only
logical 1o reform the sponsor system
| for Encina, and extend the proctor
; system to the examination rooms.
A sponsor system at the home of
! the honor system (or vice versa) is
as out of place as a nudist in Little
, America.
