"Art is long, and times is
bad but fleeting," says Vener
able Cuckoo Gordon Steedman,
who is making tracks for his
"Spring Track Issue" of the
Chaparral.
Steedman i.s not sending out
any artful dodgers, but he
wishes it announced that he has
some fast, high-stepping art
work, done to a turn by the
old favorites: Dorman H. Smith
(nominated to the All-Ameri
can Humor Board by The Texas
Ranger), Rodell Johnson, Dick
Dawson, Rollin "Sun Maid"
Pickford, and Page "Nationally
Advertised" Oilman.
That little morsel of sparkling
humaniTy, '"Junior 1 Gist, has
whipped out a coverall that is
really a coverall. While Feg
Murray, former captain of the
Stanford track team and one
time holder of the world's rec
ord for the high hurdles, has
whopped out a gigantic cartoon
called the "Snoppvciuons."
