The Editor, Sir:
It seems incredible that our ath
letes should not be done justice in
our own Stanford paper. I am re
ferring to the statement made in
the ' sports review concerning the
light in Sacramento of our Univer
sity bantamweight champion, A1
Velarde. The tactless writer simply
states that A1 Velarde "was not good
enough for his opponent."
Was the writer present at these
lights? If so, he is doing Velarde in
justice by omitting the fact that
Velarde won his two previous first
fights, the first one by k.o. and the
second one by decision. He also for
got to mention that Velarde's nose
was broken during his first fight and
that when he boxed Petragallo his
nose was in a very pitiful state.
The blind or misinformed writer ,
jilso forgets that Velarde defeated !
Nitta here at Stanford. The fact that
Nitta was robbed of the decision in
the finals at Sacramento more than
proves that Velarde was not only
good enough for the cliampion
Petragallo, but that without his in- I
jury he would have had an even
chance to win.
We suggest that reporters either
attend the events or get well in
formed before making "any criti
cisms.
Yours sincerely,
F. E. Davila
