"RUGGLES OF RED GAP"
At the Stanford Theatre
If you miss this one don't say wo
didn't warn you. True to life and !
based on fundamental truths, the j
film yet manages to be hilariously
funny. There's nothing slap-stick or
farcical about it, and this may be ,

the .secret of its '
success. The per
formances of the
)cast, including
Mary Boland,
I Roland Young
r Charlie Ruggles.
Z a s u Pitts, are I
cimorV, Anrl

u superb. And —
Charles Laughton, transcending in
one fell swoop the distance from !
Henry VIII and Papa Barrett to |
Ruggles, the perfect valet, does his
role with a perfection beyond ad- j
jective description. His sickly pallor
when he learns that he's been "lot"
to a wild-western family in that |
game called "drawing poker"; the ;
smile he's ordered to make and does !
make because he's the perfect serv- i

ice man; the moving beauty of his
rendition of the Gettysburg Ad
dress in a saloon—well, see it! and
you won't have to be urged to sit
through the film twice. The climax
tends toward melodramatic jingo
ism, but then, America of 1908 was
decidedly that way and the director
lias faithfully reproduced this along
with all his other acute observances
of this colorful American era.
