### Roger Kimball 
Neither rain nor U.C.L.A.'s tennis
team gave Stanford's varsity netmen
any trouble Saturday afternoon,
when the Cards whitewashed the
Bruins in nine straight matches.
Since thy steady downpour had made
lakes out of the Farm courts, the
visitors and Coach Sherman Lock
wood's racket-wielders agreed to go
to San Francisco and play their
matches on the indoor courts of the
Palace of Fine Arts.
The new surroundings were just
to the Indians' liking, and the team
collectively played its best tennis of
the season, losing only one set in
Ihe singles and one in the doubles.
Cards Start Well
Stanford got off to a good start in
the first singles match, when Captain
Sam Lee took the measure of
Uclan Stan Briggs, 6-3, (i-3. At the
same time, Bill Seward, one of the
team's two sophomores, gave the
Cardinal sextet ity impetus to vic
tory by trouncing George Bidwell, by
scores of 6-1, 6-1. This was an es
pecially welcome triumph for Stan
lord, since Bidwell had defeated
Seward in the only match which the
Indians lost to the Uclans in Los
Angeles. Johnny Lav/ played con
sistent, top-notch tennis while los
ing only one game in each set to
Frank Stewart of the Bruins in the
second singles.
Dey, Seward Star
Ben Dey, Seward's classmate on
the varsity, went Law one better in
a 6-0, 6-1 conquest of Henry Uhl.
Dey and Seward combined to win
the second doubles from Bidwell
and Uhl by the same scores. These
two netmen led their team by play
ing some of their best tennis.
Jack Lynch had little trouble in
his 6-2, 7-5 victory over Horace
Haight in the fifth singles; Bob
Pommer lost a set but staged a quick
comeback to defeat Uclan Bob Mil
ler by a 4-6, 6-4, 6-0 margin.
Doubles Teams Win
The first doubles match was fairly
easy for the Cards, with Lee and
Pommer whipping Briggs and Stew
art, 6-3. 6-4. In the final four-man
tilt, Law and Lynch lost the other
set dropped by the Cards, but still
gained a close win over Bruins San
lord and Robinson, with scores of
6-1, 1-6, 6-4.
They will meet U.S.C. here Satur

nine straight matches from the Bears
and lost only one to the Trojans in
the soulh.
The junior varsity netmen were
scheduled to play San Francisco
Stale Teachers College Saturday
morning, but rain caused cancella
tion of the match.
