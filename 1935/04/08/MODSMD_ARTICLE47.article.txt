### 
Old Sol, after apparently having !
Saturday's tussle safely tucked un- I
der his b<ilt, blew up and Jup Plu- ;
, vius breezed to a lopsided win.
The result—no ball game between
j California and Stanford. The game j
I will be played tomorrow, pushing
i the U.C.L.A. game one day ahead, i
now scheduled for Wednesday.
Before Jup became really ob- i
streperous, the frosh nines were able i
|(o get in some eleven innings of !
1 more or less sloppy baseball. The j
Indian Papooses contributed five j
miscues and the Bear Cubs three i
during the melee.
Glenn Hamilton pitchcd a steady ;
game for the Card yearlings and de- I
| served a better fate. For the regu- |
: lation nine innings, He allowed six
i scattered hits and but one earned !
run. He should have won 2-1 in i
the regulation nine frames but for i
a pair of errors by his teammates j
in the third.
Stanford scored first in the second
inning when the shortstop was un- <
able to handle Hamilton's drive. He
then took second on a bad pitch, j
j went to third on. an infield out, and ]
i following a base on balls, scored on j
I a double steal. Goffis' long triple to I
! right in the fifth plus a passed ball j
gave the Indians their second run.
The score:
R. 11. E. !
California 4 9 3 I
Stanford .2 2 5 )
Batteries: Wiener and Fruzza; j
