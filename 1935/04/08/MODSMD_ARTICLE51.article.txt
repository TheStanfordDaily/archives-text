## the worst HAS HAPPENED 
### 
| Angell Field was a pitiful sight
j last Saturday afternoon at 2
i o'clock, the time scheduled for the
j combined All-University and Fresno
| vs. Stanford varsity track meet.
| The cause of the gloom was the
! blessed, gentle rain that fell evenly
and persistently, with no sign of a
let-up.
Under most conditions a track
| meet would have been postponed at
I once if the track was in as poor
i shape as Angell Field was and if
rain fell several hours beforehand.
But there were plenty of reasons
why this track meet should be held
il at all possible.
Coaches Flint Hanncr nnd Dink
Templeton had already had their
practice season thoroughly ruined
by poor weather and were anxious
) that the progress of their teams
should not be further delayed.
Fresno State had its big meet
! with Southern California sched
uled for next Saturday. Stanford
faced the prospect of entering the
Big Meet with but two meets be
hind her, against six for Cali
fornia.
Skull and Snakes heads also hated
to see a postponement of the meet.
A month ago they had sold tickets
for an 1.C.4-A. benefit meet. The
| cash customers howled slightly
' when it was postponed the first time
because of rain. A second postpone
ment with but slight possibility of
! slipping it into the remainder of
the Stanford schedule would be
chaos.
Doug Montell and the radio
I men didn't want their plans up
set. They planned a double
broadcast of the Stanford meet
and the California-U.S.C. meet
from Angell Field, receiving the
latter by wire from Los Angeles.
As meet time approached the two j
i squads hurried out from the gym.
The loamy top-surface of the oval, |
made oozy by the rainfall, stuck to \
: the spikes like tar and the track was !
soon a mess.
Still no one knew whether the j
meet was on or off. As a matter
of fact, it was on and ofl' several i
times. Once or twice it seemed as i
though there was a let-up. But the
run-ways and the high jump ap- 1
proach were so .slippery that
Coach Manner finally decided that
the only hope was to postpone the
meet until Monday, and pray for ;
sunshine.
The sunshine didn't come, the j
meet was finally cancelled, the pre- j
dieted "catastrophes" arc ahead. It ,

twill bo interesting to see what hap
} pens, to put it mildly.

broadcast of the Stanford meet
and the California-U.S.C. meet
from Angell Field, receiving the
latter by wire from Los Angeles.
As meet time approached the two j
i squads hurried out from the gym.
The loamy top-surface of the oval, |
made oozy by the rainfall, stuck to \
: the spikes like tar and the track was !
soon a mess.
Still no one knew whether the j
meet was on or off. As a matter
of fact, it was on and ofl' several i
times. Once or twice it seemed as i
though there was a let-up. But the
run-ways and the high jump ap- 1
proach were so .slippery that
Coach Manner finally decided that
the only hope was to postpone the
meet until Monday, and pray for ;
sunshine.
The sunshine didn't come, the j
meet was finally cancelled, the pre- j
dieted "catastrophes" arc ahead. It ,

twill bo interesting to see what hap

| Angell Field was a pitiful sight
j last Saturday afternoon at 2
i o'clock, the time scheduled for the
j combined All-University and Fresno
| vs. Stanford varsity track meet.
| The cause of the gloom was the
! blessed, gentle rain that fell evenly
and persistently, with no sign of a
let-up.
Under most conditions a track
| meet would have been postponed at
I once if the track was in as poor
i shape as Angell Field was and if
rain fell several hours beforehand.
But there were plenty of reasons
why this track meet should be held
il at all possible.
Coaches Flint Hanncr nnd Dink
Templeton had already had their
practice season thoroughly ruined
by poor weather and were anxious
) that the progress of their teams
should not be further delayed.
Fresno State had its big meet
! with Southern California sched
uled for next Saturday. Stanford
faced the prospect of entering the
Big Meet with but two meets be
hind her, against six for Cali
fornia.
Skull and Snakes heads also hated
to see a postponement of the meet.
A month ago they had sold tickets
for an 1.C.4-A. benefit meet. The
| cash customers howled slightly
' when it was postponed the first time
because of rain. A second postpone
ment with but slight possibility of
! slipping it into the remainder of
the Stanford schedule would be
chaos.
Doug Montell and the radio
I men didn't want their plans up
set. They planned a double
broadcast of the Stanford meet
and the California-U.S.C. meet
from Angell Field, receiving the
latter by wire from Los Angeles.
