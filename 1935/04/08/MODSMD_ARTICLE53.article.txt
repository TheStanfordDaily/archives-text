[■V ;
' trimming and he hasn't taken one
1 yet in two years of Coast dual meet
j competition, it was from Lantz last
! Saturday. The lanky Bear had been
j bothered early in the season by a
I sore muscle and had his practice sea-
I son shot by geology field trips, the
| last one but a week ago. His best
| time in competition this year was 9
minutes and 50 seconds, 17 seconds
j slower that Lantz's best.
But Fowler's classic speed on the
! last lap won again. Though the rea
ison why Lantz faltered on the final
curve is not yet known this far
1 north, Fowlers' geological week in
I the high Sierfas last week may not
'have been so bad after all: you've
I supposed to get more oxygen, run
I faster when you drop from a high
altitude to a low one, so they say.
