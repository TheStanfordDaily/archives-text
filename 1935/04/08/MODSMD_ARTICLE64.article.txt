WASHINGTON, April 7 t/P>.â€”'The
American Liberty League today pro
posed prompt abolition of New Deal
agencies and experiments which
have "failed to bring about the re
sults anticipated."
The league, in a statement frankly
critical of many administration pro
grams, also urged that "definite and
unequivocal assurance be given of
{ an intention to bring the federal bud
get into balance within a reasonable
time in order to allay fears of ruin
out inflation and a v/recking of the
nation's monetary credit structure."
"Uncertainty as to the course to
be pursued by the federal govern
ment," J he league slid, "is one of
the gravest obstacles to economic
| recovery."
Accordingly, it suggested:
"That there be a prompt and frank
! appraisal of the various ambitious

economic and sociological experi
ments undertaken during the past
two years, that those which have
lailed to bring about results antici
pated be discarded, and that those
which give some promise of produc
ing beneficial results be continued
with modifications where necessary
in order to bring them within the
scope of authority properly exer
cised by the federal government in
accordance with the constitution."
