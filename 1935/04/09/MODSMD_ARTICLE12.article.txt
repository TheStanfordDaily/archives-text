Nazis, Poles Clash
Today's shooting followed a dis
| turbance between Nazis and Poles
jin Brentau, a suburb three miles
i northwest of the city limits. Poles
j claimed a bond of Nazis entered the
j home of an employe of the gas coln
; pany and beat him up.
Joel Cang, Polish citizen and War
j saw correspondent for three British
j newspapers, was arrested in the cen
i tral postoffice filing a dispatch to
| the Manchester Guardian.
Release Denraidcd
Police said he was taken into cus
today for sending a message regard
ed as contrary to Danzig's interests.
Kazimere Papee, Polish Commis
sioned in Danzig, asked the Senate
, to release Cang and explain why
he was arrested.
| Fiiril figures in the Volgstag clec
j tion showed Nazis polled only 59.1
! per cent of the vote instead of the
' 59.9 per cent first claimed. Officials
i explained errors in a number of dis
j tricts necessitated a recheck.
Nazis failed by 17,594 votes to get
I the 66 2-3 per cent needed to wipe
j out opposition parties and have an
j absolute ascendency in the Parlia-
I mcnt.
N*-*/.i Hopes Drowned
j Approximately 95,000 Danzig vot
ers, majority of them German Cath
j olics and Socialists, combined to
j drown hopes of the Hitlerites,
i Total vote cast was 234,956. Of
thus Nazis got 139,043. Failure to get
the expected majority was a great
blow to the Nazis but their leader's
issued a call for continuation of the
battle.
In Germany the press played
down failure of the propaganda
ministry to fulfill its ambitious plans
and made the Danzig election sec
ondary news.
Paper Thinks Nazis Fail
A Danzig paper declared Nazis
j had failed in two set objectives:
"First they wanted to destroy Nazi
| opposition; second they wanted to
..show that Germanism and Naziism
are the same thing. From now on
' Danzig opposition will be stronger
than ever."
Nazi leaders, on the other hand,
1 i claimed the result would have been
far different if the issue had been a
i j clear-cut plebiscite for or against re
| union with Germany.
