# Stars Must Have Brains, Stanford Actress Reveals
## 
### ROBERT EISENBACH 
She may be an up-and-coming star to the powers of Hollywood, but
| to her sorority sisters at the Delta Gamma house, Jean Rouverol is just
"Rouvie," who burns the midnight oil and Roes on dates just as they do.
Ihe (b t \ of the beautiful-ljut-diimh star is over, she believes, and
since she s plenty beautiful, and nut .so dumb, cither, she's going to equip

herself with an honest-to-goodness
J education.
"A knowledge of history and sci
ence is what counts in Hollywood,"
she declared today, "not tea-pouring
, and door-closing. For one thing au
diences are more discriminating,
you can see that in the kind of pic
lures being produced. There's no
place for the actress who has to be
coached through every scene."
Watches Psychopaths
In her last picture, "Private
Worlds," Miss Rouverol plays a
schizophrenic. That ten-dollar
word—she learned it in hor last
quarter's psychology course — de
scribes a victim of dementia praecox.
Just knowing "what" didn't satisfy
the director, however. He insisted
she know "how" as well. So that
her performance would be genuine,
she became an inmate of a Los An
geles psychopathic ward for a day,
watching patients.
As for Hollywood night life, it
just isn't so. Miss Rouverol re
vealed. "The younger generation of
! actors give parties no more wild
th;in those on the Farm," she de
clared. And she should^ know. Even
featured players, whose weekly sal
aries run into four and five figures,
have to be on the set as early as 5
o'clock in the morning, and some
times work until after 8 at night.
("There's neither the time nor the
| inclination for partying after that.

It's home and to bed, with a head
ache."
Acting is "RouvieV first love, but
writing is her avocation" She likes
to do short stories, and at present
she's dickering with the English de
partment for publication of some of
her work in the English yearbook.
As for grades, she handles 'em as
easily as a scene in front of a cam
era. She finished last quarter with a
"B plus" average.
