j "A constructive program" w;ts the
general opinion expressed by cam
pus authorities in regard to the
coming peace day conference Friday.
Including a student assembly, a se
ries of round table conferences, and
a dinner in the evening, 1 lie peace
| day conference is to be an intelligent
| and progressive discussion of cur-
I rent problems.
"I think that it is an attempt to
| take a constructive attitude toward
I peace and war; analyzing the prob
11cm, and in keeping wilh our uni
! versity standards," stated President
: Wilbur, who will preside at the
i peace day assembly.
Professor Edgar E. Robinson re
! marked: "It is a splendid thing to
! have a constructive program on that
j day." %
| "I favor the new assembly in the
j revised form. Stanford has taken a
! progressive step in presenting prob-
I lems in an orderly, intelligent man-
I ncr. One of the most important un
dertakings of any student bodies in
America," was the opinion expressed
by Mai vie Kahn, A.S.S.U. president.
Richard LaPierre, assistant pro
fessor of economics, states: "The
conference indicates we are still im-
I pressed with the painfulness of war,
I and we are hardly as yet in a posi-
I tion to accept the possibility of an
i other one."
Colonel Cubbbon, hod of the
military department, says: "It is a
| far better method than having a
j student strike. More will be accom
| plished by bringing the subject up
freely and sensibly for considera
tion. I believe the authorities have
! handled the situation very well, and
j everyone should attend the confer
| ence."
