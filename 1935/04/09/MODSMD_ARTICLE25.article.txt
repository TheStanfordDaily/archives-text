# Menlo Liquor Shops Should Be Evacuated at Once

"There is more liquor sold by bootleggers
011 the Stanford campus than is ever sold by
licensed liquor dealers." This statement by
an enforcement official for the State Hoard ol
Equalization was given last week in an inter
view with San Francisco reporters, and ac
cordingly blazed forth from metropolitan
front pages together with the implication that
canceling licenses in Mcnlo would make no
difference in Stanford's liquor situation.
Yesterday that official, queried by the Daily,
denied his responsibility for the statement,
admitted lie "knew nothing about the situa
tion," ;m<l said his jurisdiction extended only
to Mcnlo Park.
Licenses have been revoked in Mcnlo, and
Ibis official's duly now is merely to see that
liquor is not sold there, and not to make un
authorized statements about areas outside his
jurisdiction and knowledge.
Liquor is now on sale in Mcnlo. Three of
four establishments visiicd by two students
ye sterday afternoon were selling it, precisely
the olTcnse which the enforcement office is
there to control.
Should there be bootlegging on this campus
'and the business would be a losing one with
I gal, genuine liquoi available within five min
utes' drive) it would come under the control
of Santa Clara county officials and Ihe I Di
versity administration, both of whom would
be more apt to follow the law than Mcnlo
Park or state officials.
II and when speakeasies or bootleggers oper
ate 011 the Stanford campus, they should and
will he dealt with in accordance with the law.
Meanwhile it is the enforcement office's duly
to dry up Mcnlo Park, not theoretically but
actually.
Publicity Hows readily when a public official
makes such a surprising statement as the one
quoted, no matter how fallacious or unauthor
ized it may be. The pity is that some thou
sands of readers mav believe it.
