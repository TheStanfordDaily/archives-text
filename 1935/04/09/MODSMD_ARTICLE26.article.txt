# Threatening the Movie Industry
## 
### 
The movie industry speaks very seriously
of leaving this slate and settling elsewhere,
lis loud-voiced complaint originates because
of legislation now being heard in Sacramento,
concerning taxing screen productions.
Two hundred million dollars worth yearly
is a lot of industry. It would be a shame were
California to lose her outstanding claim to
lame, aside from climate. The legislators who
are indulging in their yearly lobbying at I In*
stale capitol might realize this, lest-they wake
up when it is too late.
This tax supposedly is to be levied as a type
of income tax on high earnings. The movie
magnates are tearing through Hollywood in
high indignation. They claim the proposed
legislation would be so exorbitant that it
would no longer be profitable for them to
make their pictures in Southern California.
It is probably true that a change in the locale
of moving pictures could be effected without
any great hardship on the industry. Tempera
mental stars, publicity-loving directors, all the
bizarre paraphernalia that has surrounded
this topsy-turvy industry for the last twenty
years could be transported to Florida, or New
York or London, without any great disturb
ance. This is true because everything con
nected with the iilms is of such a temporary
nature.
However, from the film colony itself rumors
with many implications travel the rounds.
Producer ISlitz says that Florida will practi
cally pay him to move his studio, while Pro
ducer (ii'iilph maintains that the-liritish film
industry is only watiing for the tax actually
to he imposed before it begins to assume a
position of dominance in world-wide film pro
duction.
II is difficult to ascertain just what the posi
tion of Hollywood will hi' should this legis
lation he shoved through. Isut state politicians
with an ear to the ground would do well to
try and keep such a lucrative business within
I he borders of the stale.
