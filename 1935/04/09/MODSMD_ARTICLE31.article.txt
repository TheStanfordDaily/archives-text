"More liquor is being .sold on the Stanford campus
by bootleggers than has ever been sold inside the
restricted zone by licensed liquor stores."â€”Don Mar
shall, .state enforcement officer for the Board of Equali
zation, in the S.F. Chronicle, Friday, April 5.
Have you ever seen a bootlegger in the spring, in the
spring?
A Stanford bootlegger in the spring, in the spring?
When the Cellar is a stellar sellar of the rnellar liquor
to the fellar
There will be a social revolution, convolution, abso
lution,
But there aren't no Stanford bootlegger in the spring,
in the spring.
Well?
