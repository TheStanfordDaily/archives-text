# CAMPUS TO CAMPUS

Only a little more than half the freshmen who enter
Stanford remain on the Farm four years. At least 20
per cent of the first year students leave after one year,
never to return. The same conditions, only in more
startling degrees, are 1o be found on the average
American campus.
There is a reason why the majority of college stu
dents don't complete their four-year course. Critics
call it "poor service"—colleges are not serving youth.
Not long ago Tristram Metcalfe, dean of Long Island
University, openly called his profession to account on
the matter of service to college students and frankly
announced that youth leaves college because he can't
get what he wants, and that those who do stay don't
get what they ought to have. He spoke wisdom.
Said Metcalf: "That college serves youth best
that builds upon the high school foundation an
elaboration of learning and keeps youth attuned
and adjusted to the rapid changes in the world
today. Instead of doing this, most colleges try to
prepare youth to live in the present by teaching
him mainly the backgrounds of civilizntion—the
past in history, literature, government, social and
natural sciences."'
In short, innumerable enthusiastic college freshmen
have their interest in college destroyed by professors
who harangue to them about the past. Before they
get the chance to learn for themselves that which is
afforded in upper - classman years, the bewildered
underclassmen get the feeling that they are wasting
their time, and one out of two quit.
Dean Metcalfe calls upon colleges to train the
youth of today to solve the economic problems of the
future. To do this it is necessary to give youth a com
prehensive background of information about the world
and its current social and economic problems; to stimu
late youth to develop capacity for careful, clear and
critical thinking; to develop understandirtg of the
world in which he lives and of present-day problem*.
Study of the past is secondary in importance. Liberal,
not special education should be the chief aim of the
college.
If universities want to hold their students they
must give those students what they raine to col
lege to get. and they must recognize that youth
will continue to live in an economic age and that
all the knowledge and culture of the past will not
compensate for neglect of the present.
The New York educator minced no words in telling
why colleges are not changing their programs to meet
modern requirements. "The main reason," says he,
"is the prevailing tendency of college faculties to con
sider every proposed change upon the basis of what is
being done in other colleges, or from the standpoint of
how the change will affect a particular department, in
stead of how it will affect the learning youth."
Self interest makes colleges tend to be old fashioned,
unserviceable to youth.
