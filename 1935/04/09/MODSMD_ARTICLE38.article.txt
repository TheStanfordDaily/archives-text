# General Tardy; R.O.T.C. Worried at Inspection
## Icy Wind, Mud, Rain Cause Added Difficulties 
### John McClelland 
The general was late, the icy wind
nearly froze the buglers' lips stiff,
iind one irate nag kicked a dime
sized hole in the face of one ol his
nosey fellows, but all in all the
Stanford R.O.T.C. big day of the year
was declared a thumping success.
Sunday night some 60 military stu
dents polished boots and belts, buck
privates glossed living horse hides.
Once a year the general comes down
irom the City to give the Stanford
artillery battery the formal once
over, and the aspirant reserve offi
cers get a taste of what a real mili
tary inspection is.
Horses Muddy
Yesterday at 1 o'clock all was in
i eadiness. Each carefully groomed
horse was dressed up in his best red
saddle blanket and snow-v/hite
bridle rope. The men were polished
and preened. Off to the polo field
the outfit sallied forth, brown mud
coating shining hoofs and boots.
For nearly an hour the parade
went round and round the field*
amid cries of "ho" and "left wheel."
Everyone shivered and shook the
rain from his face. The time for the
general's arrival came and went.
A private was .sent to call and see if
he had been delayed. He hadn't.
Generals are always late for inspec
tion, it seems.
General Lale
Only half an hour late, the general,
ar.d his staff arrived. They were met
with an icy, wet blast of renewed
vigor from the skies. But the gen
eral, an almost tiny grey little man,
didn't even put on a coat. He- stood
at the head of his company in the
rain while the outfit went through
their maneuvers. Nothing went
wrong. Real orders were shouted.
Imaginary shots were fired. The
horses behaved. Awards were pre
sented. The little general smiled his
approval to the officers and climbed
back in his car. The battery pulled
itself together and slowly drove
away. The meager crowd hurried.
