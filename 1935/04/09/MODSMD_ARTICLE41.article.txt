# Old Boy Plans Run-off Of Track Edition
## 
### 
"Ht- who runs may read." says Old
Boy Gordon Steedman of the Chap
arral cinderellas, "but he frequently
doesn't."
In proof of this contention. Steed
man is publishing an unpublished
story entitled: "The Rover Boys on
the Cinder Track, or How I Hate
You Harrington Ingham," by James
Dillington Copp Rover Boy, Jr., in
the "Track Issue" of the Chaparral.
Further manifestations of the
Chaparral's racy genius concerning
the constant running-off at the
mouth at Angell Field will be
brought to light with the release of
the story: Dizzical Education 54.4:
track methods by the ghost writer
of James Copp (marked down to 2'/j).
