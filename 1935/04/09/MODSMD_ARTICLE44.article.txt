# Indian Baseball Squad Faces Cal Today
## CARDS DEPEND ON WEATHER TO AVOID MIXUP IN GAMES Another Postponement May Cause Double Header 
### Bob Leland 
Once postponed the bull game be
tween the var.sity nines of Stanford
and California now faces a real
mix-up, unless the heavens get
away from the wailing-wall and
.stop crying all over everything.
U.C.L.A. is scheduled to play the
Indians here tomorrow, and the
game means much to them since they
ai.:e fighting for the league pennant.
Should today's game be called off,
the Brums might have to play a
double header, facing Cal in the
morning and Stanford in the after
noon.
As things stand, it'll be California
this afternoon at 3:15 and U.C.L.A.
tomorrow, barring late rains. The
field has good drainage and could
•stand a game if the weather i.s*clear.
Anderson, Ompbell to Hurl
Stan Anderson will tackle the
Bears, while Johnny Campbell is
slated to hurl against the Bruins.
Oct Morgan will do the receiving.
Otherwise the line-up will remain
unchanged with Mallatratt, Turner,
Tremaine and Clark in the infield,
and Hamilton, Leidig, and Herringer
in the outfield.
The game represents a large ques
tion mark as far as the Indians are
concerned. They are in the enviable
spot of being underdogs and in a po
sition to knock of? their ancient
rivals. They have everything to gain
and nothing to lose. Should they
win, Cal would have to take two
games from the league - leading
Bruins in order to stay on top of
the heap.
Four "Ifs" Listed
It all depends on four positions—
fours IFS that can make or break
the ball team. If Clark can roam
the short patch without kicking the
ball around or throwing it away, if
Tremaine can keep to his improved
form, if the team can improve its
hitting overnight, and if Anderson
can keep the Bear swatters under his
thumb iust in case the other three
don't materialize, then the Cards can
beat the Bears.
At any rate, the game should be
worth seeing. Lefty Hardt, famous
as the hero of the first American
Legion Little World Series .six years
ago will probably pitch against the
Indians. If he doesn't it'll be Joe
Gallison, an equally good hurler.

ago will probably pitch against the
Indians. If he doesn't it'll be Joe
Gallison, an equally good hurler.
Once postponed the bull game be
tween the var.sity nines of Stanford
and California now faces a real
mix-up, unless the heavens get
away from the wailing-wall and
.stop crying all over everything.
U.C.L.A. is scheduled to play the
Indians here tomorrow, and the
game means much to them since they
ai.:e fighting for the league pennant.
Should today's game be called off,
the Brums might have to play a
double header, facing Cal in the
morning and Stanford in the after
noon.
As things stand, it'll be California
this afternoon at 3:15 and U.C.L.A.
tomorrow, barring late rains. The
field has good drainage and could
•stand a game if the weather i.s*clear.
Anderson, Ompbell to Hurl
Stan Anderson will tackle the
Bears, while Johnny Campbell is
slated to hurl against the Bruins.
Oct Morgan will do the receiving.
Otherwise the line-up will remain
unchanged with Mallatratt, Turner,
Tremaine and Clark in the infield,
and Hamilton, Leidig, and Herringer
in the outfield.
The game represents a large ques
tion mark as far as the Indians are
concerned. They are in the enviable
spot of being underdogs and in a po
sition to knock of? their ancient
rivals. They have everything to gain
and nothing to lose. Should they
win, Cal would have to take two
games from the league - leading
Bruins in order to stay on top of
the heap.
Four "Ifs" Listed
It all depends on four positions—
fours IFS that can make or break
the ball team. If Clark can roam
the short patch without kicking the
ball around or throwing it away, if
Tremaine can keep to his improved
form, if the team can improve its
hitting overnight, and if Anderson
can keep the Bear swatters under his
thumb iust in case the other three
don't materialize, then the Cards can
beat the Bears.
At any rate, the game should be
worth seeing. Lefty Hardt, famous
as the hero of the first American
Legion Little World Series .six years
ago will probably pitch against the
Indians. If he doesn't it'll be Joe
Gallison, an equally good hurler.
