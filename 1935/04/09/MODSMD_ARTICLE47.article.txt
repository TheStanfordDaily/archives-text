j 1935 RUGBY TEAM
HOLDS STATE TITLE

To Stanford's 1935, rugby team this
! column is dedicated—dedicated to
j their skill, power, sincerity, and suc
-1 cess—the success that gave them the
' championship of the California Rug-
I by Union.
Forty men worked for three
months to build the team, worked
j as hard as did the Big Fed football
machine, but received not one
tenth of the public acclaim or other
remuneration showered upon the
, warriors of the autumn.
j Those two-score athletes built a
[ championship Stanford team because
they wanted to, because they liked
! to play rugby, not because of the
superficial fol-de-rol attached to
; American football. And, in con.se
; quence, they derived lasting bene
: fits.
i At the beginning of the season in
; January the men were asked what
! kind of award or honor they would
: like as compensation for their in
tercollegiate play. Almost to a man
I they asked for none—just to let
! them play as they pleased, and en
joy the sport without any entangl
ing stigma attached.
Enough of this—but a few facts
about the record the men made for
themselves.
They won the California Rugby
Union championship, and tied for
the intercollegiate championship
! with a smashing win over Cal's
bears. Their only loss in eight games
saw them getting one adverse break
after another, and then lose by a
single point to U.C.L.A.

I CHANCE TO REPRESENT
! U.S. IN NEXT OLYMPICS

ROLL UP LARGE
MARGIN OF SCORES

They scored IG4 points to the op
position's 48, and obviously only
coasted in half the games.

I The record made by the "B" team
is even more remarkable—a total of
119 points to the opposition's 6.
Then men who made up these two
teams, and worked for their suc
cess, are:
Roger Hager, captain, John Reis
ner, Ray Lewis, Tony Cockins, Jim
Trompas, Joe Vigna, Frank Alus- |
j tiza, Fred Abbott, Dick Morrison,
i Bob Mondavi, Neils Larsen, Frank
Ingersoll, Jerry Peters, Jim Mullen, i
Jack Walton, Dick Becker, Primo
Pniotti, Jack Damerel, John Mer
ritt.
Marvin Taylor, Louis Bansbach,
Aylett Cotton, George Fuller, An
|son Hayes, Dick Forhan, Paul
Steiner, GilF Meyers, Harry Goff,
jW. C. Harrington, Chuck Ducom-
I mun, manager.

These men all were behind Coach
Jim Wylie, who came up every day,
j away from his fruit-jobber business !
, in San Jose, to help build the team,
I and Harry Maloney, minor sports
1 director.
I And next year . . . looms large a
j chance to represent the United
States in the Olympic Games at Ber
j lin, a goal which requires not the
I slightest prodding or cajoling. The;

Cards will have nine of their out- ;
standing regulars back, and with |
new men and capable substitutes i
. . . what an outlook for next year! i
