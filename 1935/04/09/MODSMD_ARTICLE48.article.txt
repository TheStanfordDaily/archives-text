# INDIAN TRACK IN TO TRAVEL SOUTH FOR U.C.L.A. MEET
## Heavy Practice Sessions Planned This Week 
### 
But three days of practice remain
before the Card "tough luck" track
, men journey south to meet Harry
i Trotter's U.C.L.A. team in the second .
j meet of the season, and the last be
| fore the all-important Cal meet
! April 20.
| Three days will be a short enough
I time for Coach Dink Templeton to
, whip his men into some kind of
| shape, so Dink plans to make them
days of hard work.
Track Still Poor
The track yesterday was still not
conducive to the best performances,
the inside lanes harboring several
good-sized puddles.
Yesterday saw time trials in the
I 880, mile, ar.d two-mile. Slim Chuck
: Nimmo ran through tho slush for a
4:32 mile, a better time than he made
at Washington, and an altogether en
couraging performance. Warren Dix
i on's cold of last week rendered him !
a bit weak, and he finished some 20 i
! yards astern of Nimmo.
llun Time Trials
Rusty March ran a 2.03 half, also j
'good time in the mud, four seconds J
i faster than any other of the varsity
i 880 men.
Dave Devlin, though not a "mud
j der" type, stepped eight laps in
10:13, running most of the way in the
third and fourth lanes.
Quarter-milers A1 Blackman and i
Truck Dillinger, who will probably
have to face Jimmy Lu Valle Satur
day, confined their efforts to running
sprints, but looked as fast as they
have ail season in outrunning the
rest of the sprinters.
