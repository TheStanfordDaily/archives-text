# NETMEN BATTLE U.S.C. SATURDAY
## 
### 
With a virtual strangle-hold on
tlie Pacific Coast Conference title,
Stanford's varsity tennis players
will put in all the practice allowed
them by the weather this week in
preparation for the U.S.C. matches
Saturday.
The Trojans, who took only one
match from the Indians in Los An
geles during spring vacation, are
capable of much better games, and
may .prove it on the Farm courts at
130 o'clock on the afternoon of
April 13.
Only Charles Carr, playing sec
ond singles, spoiled a clcan sweep
for Stanford in the southland. Carr
defeated Johnny Law, who was off
form, 7-5, 4-6, 6-2.
Ben De-y will be favored to re
peat his win over Phil Wooledge,
Trojan captain, in the fourth singles.
The first two doubles matches j
should again be easy for Stanford.
Captain Lee and Pommer will have
a marked edge over Vernon, John,
and Carr, having already beaten
them, 9-7, 6-1
If the Trojans repeat their pre
vious 5-4 triumph when they clash
with California at Berkeley Friday,
;>nd Stanford trounces U.S.C., as she
.should, on Saturday, Sherman Lock
wood's Cardinals will cinch first
place in the conference.
