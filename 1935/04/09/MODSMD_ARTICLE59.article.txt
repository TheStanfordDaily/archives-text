# Films of Wild Life in North To Be Shown
## W. L. Finley, Author And Explorer, Talks Tonight 
### Barbara Sweet 
Great Kodialc bears charging the
cameraman will be among the many
exciting scenes that William L. Fin
ley, author and explorer, will throw
on the screen tonight when he gives
his illustrated lecture, "Birds, Bergs,
and Kodiak Bears," in the Assembly
Hall at 7:30 o'clock.
Finley, with Arthur N. Puck, presi
dent of the American Nature Asso
| eiation, spent several weeks in
; Alaska during the summer of 1931
hunting Kodiak bears with a movie
camera. Some were photographed
at a distance of but 25 feet. Many
shots were taken from a blind as
the bears rushed into a stream of
water, catching salmon in the swift
1 waters.
Gigantic ico pinnacles toppling
from glaciers into the sea and myr
iads of water-fowl flashing from
coastal caves are other scenes that
Finley will show. These pictures
were taken en two long cruises ihe
explorer made into British Columbia
and Alaska at the same time as his
other expedition.
After long days of cruising, Fin
ley's cameras were also able to be
turned on two whales "breaching"
or jumping at play, sometimes shoot
; ing clear of the water or turning and
landing on their backs, sending up
mountains of spray. This is the first
| time that a fifty-foot whale has been
photographed leaping from the
water.
Finley is a nationally known nat
i uralist, author and lecturer, as well
as a most successful photographer of
wild animal life. From over 20,000
feet of negative exposed on his ex
i peditions, he has chosen 5000 feet
I to illustrate his talk.
