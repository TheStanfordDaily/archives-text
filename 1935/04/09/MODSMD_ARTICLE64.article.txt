Dr. Walter Crosby Eells of the
! education department spoke over
j station KGO on the weekly Stanford
< Hour last night on the subject, "The
; Junior College and the Youth Prob
lem."
j Dr. Eells in his lecture asserted
; hat "the most significant movement
in American eduealion today is the
growth of the junior college, which
is even more significant in view of
j the probable development within the
I next few years." A notable exam
ple of this development, he pointed
out, will be the establishment of a
junior college in San Francisco next
fall.
He advocated the further estab
j lishment of the junior college as i
J means of caring for the young high
1 school graduate who can not afford
1 a university education. It is cheaper
for the taxpayer than any of the
other alternatives and prepares the
young men and women to lead a
better economic, social, and political
life, Eells concluded.
The Snake River canyon in cen
tral Idaho is deeper by 1000 feet
than the famous Grand Canyon of
I the Colorado.
