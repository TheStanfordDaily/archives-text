# Dr. Curry Talks On Social Organization
## Religion Seminar Meets For Last Time Today 
### 
Stressing the importance of social j
institutions to the evaluation of hu- j
man personality, Dr. £}ruce Curry I
opened the second session of his
three-day seminar on "Religion and :
Social Change."
Change Necessary
Of the most important social in
stitutions —the state, the school, the |
church, business, and the home—Dr. j
Curry says, '"They are our greatest
asset, but they tend to become our i
greatest liability. It is necessary I
that we modify them from time to ,
time to give life a chance, but we |
arc often blindly loyal to these in- i
stitutions which we have had for .so |
long, and in which we J
unnecessary."
Dr. Curry, who will give his last
talk today at 4:15 o'clock in the
Little Theatre, believes that institu
tions should support the people, j
instead of the people having to bear
the burden of supporting the institu
tions. We judge the value of an j
institution by the contribution it
makes to life.
Crowd Out Religion
Believing that we should not al
low any one of these major institu-
I tions to become more powerful
i than the others, Dr. Curry claims
j that business has done this, and has
| crowded out religion. As a result of
j this, the whole civilization is suffer- i
j ing from a lack of spiritual feeling. ,
I Now is the time when we need to
I recapture the genuine, high ideal of
I religion.
I Dr. Curry says that everyone
I should believe in some-God, whether
j he call it a force, an element, a fac- j
| tor, an entity, or a being.
! . Toward Belter World
Agreeing with several prominent
j icligious leaders, Dr. Curry does not
i feel that God should bo made re
sponsible for everything, good 01"
j bad. He thinks that the world is in
l a process of evolution, and will
I eventually become a better one.
Dr. Curry considers brains and
| imagination the means through
i which God can work.
A more concrete definition of re
ligion given by Dr. Curry is, "Re
ligion is living all of life in a con
scious sense of fellowship with God."

Of the most important social in
stitutions —the state, the school, the |
church, business, and the home—Dr. j
Curry says, '"They are our greatest
asset, but they tend to become our i
greatest liability. It is necessary I
that we modify them from time to ,
time to give life a chance, but we |
arc often blindly loyal to these in- i
stitutions which we have had for .so |
long, and in which we J
unnecessary."
Dr. Curry, who will give his last
talk today at 4:15 o'clock in the
Little Theatre, believes that institu
tions should support the people, j
instead of the people having to bear
the burden of supporting the institu
tions. We judge the value of an j
institution by the contribution it
makes to life.
Crowd Out Religion
Believing that we should not al
low any one of these major institu-
I tions to become more powerful
i than the others, Dr. Curry claims
j that business has done this, and has
| crowded out religion. As a result of
j this, the whole civilization is suffer- i
j ing from a lack of spiritual feeling. ,
I Now is the time when we need to
I recapture the genuine, high ideal of
I religion.
I Dr. Curry says that everyone
I should believe in some-God, whether
j he call it a force, an element, a fac- j
| tor, an entity, or a being.
! . Toward Belter World
Agreeing with several prominent
j icligious leaders, Dr. Curry does not
i feel that God should bo made re
sponsible for everything, good 01"
j bad. He thinks that the world is in
l a process of evolution, and will
I eventually become a better one.
Dr. Curry considers brains and
| imagination the means through
i which God can work.
A more concrete definition of re
ligion given by Dr. Curry is, "Re
ligion is living all of life in a con
scious sense of fellowship with God."
