The Stanford captain and the stel
lar Bear freshman are the greatest
breast stroke swimmers ever de
veloped on the Pacific Coast, ac
cording to Coach Nort Thornton.
Foster, Pacific Coast Intercollegiate
title-holder, set the mark of 2:35.4
in the 200-yard breast stroke. He
also is the national champion for the
400-yard event, with a time of 6:05.7
seconds.
Teasdale has developed rapidly
within recent months. He first as
tounded Coait aquatic circles with
his remarkable 2:34.1 for 200 yards in
the Little Big Meet. The following
week, swimming 2:49 in the 220, he
trimmed Foster to capture the
Northern California championship.
Teasdale's times are the fastest ever
swum on the Coast and, say swim
ming experts, he's due to set a few
world records before very long.
Gilhula to Swim
Foster had never been beaten in
collegiate competition until the
previously unheard of Bear cub
turned the trick. Both boys are can
didates for the 1936 Olympic squad.
The appearance of Jimmy Gilhula
on Friday evening's program prom
ises a great thrill for the spectators.

swimmers, is the one-man team who
swam the mile at the N.C.A.A.

ago and smashed 13 American rec
ords on the way. Alone he scored 9
points to give U.S.C. third place in
the meet.
To Compete in 440
Gilhula is scheduled to compete

in the 440-yard free style. Gilhula

Indian captain, Bobby Foster, with
face Earl Teasdale, sensational Cali
fornia yearling, in a match race.
Foster and Teasdale will swim the
50-yard breast stroke, attempting to
establish a new American record for
the 20-yard course. The present na
tional mark is 29.7 seconds, set at
Santa Maria in 1932 by Troy's John
Paulsen.
Title Holders Swim
The Stanford captain and the stel
lar Bear freshman are the greatest
breast stroke swimmers ever de
veloped on the Pacific Coast, ac
cording to Coach Nort Thornton.
Foster, Pacific Coast Intercollegiate
title-holder, set the mark of 2:35.4
in the 200-yard breast stroke. He
also is the national champion for the
400-yard event, with a time of 6:05.7
seconds.
Teasdale has developed rapidly
within recent months. He first as
tounded Coait aquatic circles with
his remarkable 2:34.1 for 200 yards in
the Little Big Meet. The following
week, swimming 2:49 in the 220, he
trimmed Foster to capture the
Northern California championship.
Teasdale's times are the fastest ever
swum on the Coast and, say swim
ming experts, he's due to set a few
world records before very long.
Gilhula to Swim
Foster had never been beaten in
collegiate competition until the
previously unheard of Bear cub
turned the trick. Both boys are can
didates for the 1936 Olympic squad.
The appearance of Jimmy Gilhula
on Friday evening's program prom
ises a great thrill for the spectators.

swimmers, is the one-man team who
swam the mile at the N.C.A.A.
championships at Harvard two weeks
ago and smashed 13 American rec
ords on the way. Alone he scored 9
points to give U.S.C. third place in
the meet.
