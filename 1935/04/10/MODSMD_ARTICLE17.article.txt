Myriads of water-fowl flashing

cubs suspicious but playful, 40-ton
whales leaping into the air, and gi
gantic ice-pinnacles toppling from
glaciers into the sea were some of
the scenes in the spectacular motion

Stalking Kodiak bears with the
best-known hunter in Alaska, A.
Hasselborg, Finley was able to get
some exciting pictures of Kodiak
and grizzly bears when they came
to fish along salmon streams. Taken

der to slow down the swift move
ments of these carnivorous animals,,
the bears were shown rushing the
salmon out of the pools into the
shallows and landing them in a
shower of spray.
Landing on far-off islands, Finley
filmed birds seldom seen except, in
museums. Multitudes of murres
tenanted the shelving cliffs and
petrels, auklets, and puffins bur
rowed like squirrels to build their

slopes of basaltic islands.
