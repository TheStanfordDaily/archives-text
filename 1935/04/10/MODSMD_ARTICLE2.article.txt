# England Given German Views

### 
LONDON, April 9 (A 3 ).â€”Sir John
Simon, British foreign secretary,
gave the House of Commons first
official summary of Germany's se
curity views today as the govern
ment completed outline of its Stresa
proposals.
Dispatches from Paris said a
Franco-Russian mutual assistance
pact will be signed when Foreign
Minister Pierre Laval visits Moscow
late this month.
Official circles said Laval and the
Soviet foreign commissar, Maxim
Litvinoff, would sign the accord,
which I hey described as calling for
mutual aid only if the mutual assist
ance terms of the proposed general
pact fall down.
Hitler, Sir John told the Com
mons, wants:
1. Land and air arms equality.
2. A navy 35 per cent as large as
Great Britain's, or about 400,000 tons.
3. A nonaggression pact among
powers interested in European ques
tions with provisions for consulta
tion in case of aggression, but no
"Eastern Locarno" nor mutual as
sistance pact with Russia.
4. No nonaggression pact including
Lithuania until the status of Memel
territory, former German possession
now held by the Baltic country, is
satisfactorily regulated.
5. A pact providing for noninter
ference in Austria only if the powers
arc able to agree on one satisfactory
to Germany, which solves the diffi
culty of defining just what consti
tutes interference.
