# U.C. BASEBALL TEAM DEFEATS STANFORD, 5-3
## Rally Wins lilt for Bears; Stanford Plays U.C.L.A. This Afternoon 
### 
One big inning gave the California
Bears a 5-3 baseball victory ovci
Stanford yesterday. That frame
ruined the work of Stan Anderson,
who pitched a fine game. Ten bat
ters walked back to the dugout after
swinging at his offerings.
The Bears scored three runs on a
single, two doubles, and a fielder's
choice. Dutton hit down the center,
and while Turner was looking for
four-leaf clovers, Thompson scored
from second with what proved to be
the winning run. California added
another tally in the sixth on an er
ror and a single with a stolen base
sandwiched in.
The Indians drew first blood in
the third. Leidig singled but Her
ingcr forced him at second. Mal
latratt got his first of three hits, a
solid poke to left. Hamilton beat out
a bunt, and after Turner had fouled
out, Heringer scored on Thompson's
error.
Mallatratt singled in the seventh,
stole second, went to third on a bad
throw, and scored on Hamilton's in
field out. Leidig's second hit, a
stolen base, and Mallatratt's blow
to center counted the Cards' last
tally in the ninth. The rally was
short lived, as Hamilton and Turner
failed to connect.
Cards Improve
On the whole, Stanford looked
much more like a ball team than at
any other time this season. Tremaine
looked good at third, and Mallatratt
played his usual sparkling game at
first base.
Clark and Turner, with the ex
ception of single lapses, played good
ball. Turner made a fine stop in
the ninth, but his hitting still re
minds one of a child wielding a
lolly-pop. He should do better
when he has had more practice and
finds his eye.
Hamilton Stars
Hamilton turned in the fielding
gem of the day when he came from
deep left-center field to take a high
fly on the foul line. He had to reach
out with one hand and made the
catch on the dead run.
This afternoon at 3:15 the Indians
play host to the league-leading
Bruins from U.C.L.A. These same
Uclans gained a firmer hold on the
the top spot when they beat Cali
fornia, 2 to 1, in 11 innings Monday.
A win for the southerners would
practically clinch at least a tie for
the crown, even though they drop
their two remaining games. The
Cards could upset the whole scheme
of things by beating the Uclans.
Since U.C.L.A. is inclined to play
spotty ball a Stanford win is not out
of the question.
