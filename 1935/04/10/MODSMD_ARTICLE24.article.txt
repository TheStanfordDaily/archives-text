# Advantage of Religion Told By Dr. Curry
## Social Change Discussed In Final Speech 
### 
Concluding his three-day seminar
on "Religion and Social Change,"
Dr. Bruce Curry yesterday stressed
the new outlook and the many bene
fits which high religion can give us.
Dr. Curry believes that the en
trance of high religion into one's life
gives one a new and better ideal or
goal. A distinctive method of at
taining this ideal is presented by re
ligion, and a dynamic force with
v/hich to aid attainment accompa
nies the two other factors.
Levels N t wned
Three different levels of being
were pointed out by Dr. Curry—the
divine, the human, and the sub
human. He thinks that the atti
tudes and actions of most of us be
long in the sub-human stage. There
is a constant fear in all of us that
others are not human, and thus mis
trust and jealousy arise, causing in
ternal strife and even war.
One interpretation of religion is
giving the best that we have to the
best that we know. This is one meth
of adopting religion that would
is a characteristic common to many
of us.
Recognition Needed
"There are three factors which en
able us to bring our spirit into con
tact with the spirit of God—recogni
tion, appreciation, and co-operation.
To obtain the first of these," he says,
"we must recognize God's charac
teristic expression — beauty, truth,
justice, and goodness." Dr. Curry
believes that if we obtain the first
factor the others will follow, that
the latter two are not obtainable
without the first.
Dr. Curry believes that nothing
worth while is received from social
change unless it is accompanied by
religion.
