# Ex Committee's Meeting Mulls By-Law Errors
## Passing of New Liquor Clause in Social Code Gives Only Possession of Liquor on Campus As Grounds for Student Expulsion 
### IRVIN JOKGENSEN 
Ex Committee spent its valuable two hours last night in debating the
Fullenwider compilation of the scrambled A.S.S.U. by-laws despite the
fact that Student Manager Ben Cave crime out in favor of running the
A.S.S.U. on "common law" and doing away with the by-laws entirely.

9 After being somewhat elated over
: the fact that they had passed the
j "liquor clause" in the Stanford so
| cial conduct code without including
| any reference to possession of liquor
i off-campus, Ex Committee's en
thusiasm was dampened when Pres
ident Kahn pointed out that this
i status of affairs has existed ever
since last year. Mort D'Evelyn
mournfully said: "We're not really
doing anything then."
"Conduct Unbecoming"
The; code now gives possession of
I liquor as grounds for expulsion on
I campus, but not "or elsewhere."
, When elsewhere, Stanford students
1 are governed by the clause: "All
cases of conduct unbecoming a
, Stanford student are subject to the
; discretionary powers of the stu
dent (Men's and Women's) councils."
i The work on the by-laws con
sisted only of changing all the er
rors in both the A.S.S.U. Handbook
I and the "official copy," and combin
i ing them into a new "official copy"
presented by representative Frank
' Fullenwider for the first part of the
by-laws. The rest of the by-laws
will be finished at future meetings.
