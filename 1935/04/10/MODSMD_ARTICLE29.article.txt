# Senior Ball Reservations May Be Made This Week
## 
### 
Any seniors who have not already
received reservation cards for Senior
Ball bids may sign the reservation
list at the A.S.S.U. office in the Old
Union this week.
Bids will be sold only to those
seniors who have paid their class
dues. All who wish to attend the
ball must make reservations in ad
vance, as the number of bids is
limited.
