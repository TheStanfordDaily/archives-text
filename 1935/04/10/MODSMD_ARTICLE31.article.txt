# Ex Committee Works Out On By-Laws
## 
### 
Ex committee members List nighl look up
work which h:is been neglected since hisl
spring quarter, when I hoy began to consider
the by-laws of the A.S.S.F. constitution.
When :t new constitution was adopted hist
year with its ensuing details ol' articles and
by-laws, these were later incorporated into
the I'ni versilv handbook, lull tlie hy-laws
themselves have never heen officially adopted,
nor codified in their final form.
la their meeting last night, the Executive
Committee considered :i portion of the articles
with their attendant hv-laws, and will follow
through until they are perfectly complete, and
in their lasting form. This discussion and
adoption of the hy-laws will probably take
two or more meetings before the work is com
plete.
Wading through all the articles of a com
plex constitution and making final decisions
on the exact wording of the many small
clauses is tedious and lengthy work. Ilow
< - er. Ex Committee has taken the plunge into
sea of by-laws and what finally will evolve
is well worth the trouble, for future student
government.
