Miller's henchmen have failed in their band
playing, llag-waving attempt to gain a Uvo
lhirds majority in the Danzig Vokstag, and
Germany is chagrined at their failure, wonder
ing just what is wrong.
Not only that, but anti-Nazi factions, un
commonly strong in thai group of independent
people, have demanded another election,
charging that thousands of voters were
coerced into marking their ballots for the
Swastika. All of Ibis is unexplainable to the
fanatically loyal Germans, who cannot under
stand just why the Saar should vote over
whelmingly Nazi and the Free City of Danzig
ol herwise.
An answer which may save loyal Nazis
some h.ss of sleep, is that the population of
Danzig and the population of the Saar are
two different groups in nationality, education,
and intelligence.
The Saar is a region of peasants, coal-miners
and small farmers who are much more apt to
submit lo the demagogic pleadings of a Hitler
ite orator than to listen lo reason. Danzig,
on the other hand, is a thriving commercial
cily of merchants, shippers, and tradesmen.
Danzig is one of the leading seaports of
Europe, and its people are alive, alert lo
political and international all'airs.
So Hitler must he content with a mere
lifly-nine per cent of the Vokstag, with the
possibility that even this may be cut down
should a new election be held. The move to
"follow the Saar" has failed, and Germany
will probably have to wail a while longer
perhaps revising her tactics of harangue,
before there is any possibility of a merger of
Danzig with the Fatherland.
