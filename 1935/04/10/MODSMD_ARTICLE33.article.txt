# Ochs and The New York Times
## 
### 
The success story of Adolph S. Ochs, proud
publisher of the Xew York Times. \v;is closed
Monday afternoon with the death of that dis
tinguished ineiuher of newsdom's upper crust.
lit- had risen from the humble newsboy on
the streets of Chattanooga to publisher of one
of the greatest newspapers ol the country in
the largest city of the world. He had taken over
the limes at the age of 3<X in a city recking
with the profitable "yellow" journalism of
Hearst and Pulitzer. In such a setting he set
out to run a great newspaper to contain "all
the news that's lit to print."
His idealism was rewarded with greater
profits than came to Ihe "sensational" paper
of his rivels. His 100,000 readers, which he
nurtured from a mere 10.000, proved that a
larger segment of the public was intellec
tually curious than one would judge from the
ciilieisnis lÂ»v Henry 1.. Mencken. He showed
that il was possible to cater to the public with
a trustworthy, complete, non-partisan, and
decent newspaper.
He was a pioneer in the adoption of stand
ards to improve newspaper advertising typo
graphy and content and in the introduction ol
lotagravure printing and Ihe book review

supplement to the paper.
I lie Times under Oehs regarded its func
tion ;is similar to that of a university- as that
ot a depository of knowledge ;is it rose to the
surface, presenting both sides without being
dogmatic. In that sense the Times gained
recognition as being one of the most effective
conservators of civilization.
Although the story of Ochs is ended, it will
be hard t<i find his successor, lor the Times
was his paper.
