# Stanford Versus Utah in Polo
## 
### 
Intercollegiate polo makes its lirsl bow of
the season on the campus this afternoon, when
Stanford mallet wiehlers take on a visiting
team from the t niversity of I'tah.
Led by a strong bunch of veterans, the
(lard poloists begin their first test against an
opponent whose strength is unknown. The
t'tah riders bring practically nothing with
them but iheir ability to play the game, but
this may be enough to give the campus team
a serious afternoon. Horses for the visiting
team will be supplied from the Stanford
stables, and to make the series absolutely
fair, so far as mounts are concerned, it has
been arranged to swap ponies between the
two teams during half lime.
Stanford poloists have led the vanguard of
coast college polo teams the last four seasons,
and on more than one occasion only defeat
from I Diversity of Arizona teams has kept
the (lard varsity from intercollegiate top
laurels.
And so with free admission, a visiting team
of unknown strength, and ample parking
place around the area of tlie polo field, the
Farm riders should have plenty of support
in their lirst venture. Especially if it doesn't
rain.
