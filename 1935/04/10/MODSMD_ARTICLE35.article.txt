## DANZIG AND NAZISâ€”COOPER 
### CEDRIC LARSON 
When the people of the free city of Danzig held
their Vokstag election last Sunday they were not, as
many readers of the American press were led to be
lieve, voting to return within the folds of Germany.
Neither did the Nazi set-back as a result of the election
mean that Nazidom is crushed in the coveted commer
cial city of turbulent northern Europe.
Jn fact, the much publicized vote in Danzig is
only slightly significant as far as Germany is con
cerned. William Alpha Cooper, emeritus profes
sor of German, who spent some time in Danzig
last summer and had the opportunity to talk with
many high officials including the president, does
not believe Hitler had any hopes of gaining back
Danzig through Sunday's election.
National Socialist (Nazi) js simply the name of a
political party, Professor Cooper explains. The Nazi
party in Danzig is different from the party of the same
name in Germany, and the Nazi party in Austria is
not the same as the other two. Danzig Nazis are not
anti-Semitic. They have bonds in common with Hitler's
party, but there is nevertheless a significant difference
between the two.
Sunday's election was very likely an attempt to
overwhelm opposing parties in the free cily and to
give a clear indication that German-populated Danzig
may want to return to its mother country. But the
League of Nations has much to say before that event
can ever take place, even though Danzig should vote
unanimously to give up its freedom.
Professor Cooper believes the people of the free
city want to follow the Saar. and naturally, since
Danzig has been a German city for centuries. An
other reason it has for desiring alliance is the f*'|Ct
that its trade is falling oil rapidly as a result of
Polish competition. Poland has built a seaport of
its own through which it is diverting some 44) per
cent of the trade which once was Danzig's. And
the free city is greatly dependent on Poland for
much of its commerce.
"Germany," says Professor Cooper, "is only fighting
to get back on its feet and to get its people out of ihe
slough of despond. It is just as natural for them to
want to get back Danzig a.s it would be for us to covet
Chicago if it were made a free city as a result of war.
Germany has no power in Danzig, but it is in a posi
tion to exert great influence in the city's politics."
Hostility among the many little countries of north
ern Europe, says Professor Cooper, has made it im
possible foi true peace to exist since 1914. Boundaries
are guarded day and night and intruders are promptly
arrested. "I was in a boat that was actually fired upon
when it approached the coast of Poland. Hostilities and
shootings are common occurrences."
The independence of Danzig shouldn't be of
much concern to most countries, Professor Cooper
believes. Whether it is free or not will not affect
its commercial importance and usefulness to the
world in general.

give a clear indication that German-populated Danzig
may want to return to its mother country. But the
League of Nations has much to say before that event
can ever take place, even though Danzig should vote
unanimously to give up its freedom.
Professor Cooper believes the people of the free
city want to follow the Saar. and naturally, since
Danzig has been a German city for centuries. An
other reason it has for desiring alliance is the f*'|Ct
that its trade is falling oil rapidly as a result of
Polish competition. Poland has built a seaport of
its own through which it is diverting some 44) per
cent of the trade which once was Danzig's. And
the free city is greatly dependent on Poland for
much of its commerce.
"Germany," says Professor Cooper, "is only fighting
to get back on its feet and to get its people out of ihe
slough of despond. It is just as natural for them to
want to get back Danzig a.s it would be for us to covet
Chicago if it were made a free city as a result of war.
Germany has no power in Danzig, but it is in a posi
tion to exert great influence in the city's politics."
Hostility among the many little countries of north
ern Europe, says Professor Cooper, has made it im
possible foi true peace to exist since 1914. Boundaries
are guarded day and night and intruders are promptly
arrested. "I was in a boat that was actually fired upon
when it approached the coast of Poland. Hostilities and
shootings are common occurrences."
The independence of Danzig shouldn't be of
much concern to most countries, Professor Cooper
believes. Whether it is free or not will not affect
its commercial importance and usefulness to the
world in general.
When the people of the free city of Danzig held
their Vokstag election last Sunday they were not, as
many readers of the American press were led to be
lieve, voting to return within the folds of Germany.
Neither did the Nazi set-back as a result of the election
mean that Nazidom is crushed in the coveted commer
cial city of turbulent northern Europe.
Jn fact, the much publicized vote in Danzig is
only slightly significant as far as Germany is con
cerned. William Alpha Cooper, emeritus profes
sor of German, who spent some time in Danzig
last summer and had the opportunity to talk with
many high officials including the president, does
not believe Hitler had any hopes of gaining back
Danzig through Sunday's election.
National Socialist (Nazi) js simply the name of a
political party, Professor Cooper explains. The Nazi
party in Danzig is different from the party of the same
name in Germany, and the Nazi party in Austria is
not the same as the other two. Danzig Nazis are not
anti-Semitic. They have bonds in common with Hitler's
party, but there is nevertheless a significant difference
between the two.
Sunday's election was very likely an attempt to
overwhelm opposing parties in the free cily and to
give a clear indication that German-populated Danzig
may want to return to its mother country. But the
League of Nations has much to say before that event
can ever take place, even though Danzig should vote
