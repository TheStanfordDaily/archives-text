WASHINGTON, April 9.—Two hundred dollars is
what fhe average university student would pay to get
a flunk raised to a C—if he had the $200.
The price-fixing is done by Professor Robert Thorn
dike of George Washington University, who has just
completed a survey in which students there evaluated
various articles and experiences in comparison with
$500 in cash.
Though boosting a flunk to a C was declared worth
$200 to a rough, a co-ed would only pay $100. Con
versely, though, women would give $400 for a two
weeks' trip to Bermuda with all expenses paid; men
rated it worth $200.
But the opportunity to attend a first-class hanging
with all attendant trimmings wasn't worth a cent to
anyone. A private interview with Adolph Hitler was
found to be on a par with the hanging.
Men valued a new Ford at $275. That's a good
bit ofl Henry's f.0.b., but it's better lhan the women's
price of an even $100. But a horse will bring $130 (if
it has a market value of $150), Dr. Thorndike dis
covered —if the woman does the buying. Roughs think
no horse is worth more than $35, he found.
A trip to the South Seas lured both sexes to the
tune of $550; and both would give $1200 for a year's
trip around the world. A trip to the South Pole with
Admiral Bvrd drew an even zero.
Here's the ha;-is for Dr. Tliomdike's figuring:
Each student who participated in the test stated
the number of days h« would be willing to endure
solitary confinement (without disgrace) for $500. The
other experiences and articles were then rated by each
student in terms of the number of days of confinement
he would endure to have each. Correlation of the
days for $500 and for each experience or possession
disclosed Ihe money value to (he student of ihe latter.
