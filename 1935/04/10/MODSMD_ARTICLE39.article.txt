"CAST DOWN THE LAUREL," by
Arnold Gingrich. Alfred Knopf.
$2.50. At tile Stanford Bookstore.
''Esquire" is decidedly a modern,
' unique, and sophisticated magazine;
and its editor, Arnold Gingrich, has
written a novel certainly ultra
j modern, and one which distinctly
breaks with all traditions in the ac
cepted style of novel writing.
"Cast Down the Laurel" is divided
, into three sections; in the first, an
advertising man writes to a novelist
I friend, telling him of characters
j whom he regards as worthy of a
book; the second part deals with
! these characters, as molded into a
| popular novel, where character and
i reality are sacrificed to dramatic ixi
i tensity and action; the last chapter
brings us back to the breezy, col
loquial style of the advertising man,
who points out the fallacies, of his
I friend's interpretations, and tells the
| actual outcome of the characters:
The story deals with Karl Telec,
p musical genius, who scores out
| standing ovations in his fn'st per
formances, but who lacks the saving
â–  grace of mediocrity, and, dissatis
fied with himself, leaves the concert
stage to found a school of music.
The action is centered mainly about
\ Telec and his favorite pupil, Chalice,
i Moderns should find the book en
tertaining and novel fare.
