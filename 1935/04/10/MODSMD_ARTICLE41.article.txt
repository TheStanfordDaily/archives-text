# INDIAN, UTAH POLO TEAMS VIE TODAY IN SERIES OPENER
## Rasmussen, Beal, Rogers, Fullerton to Start 
### Charles Thomas 
Weather conditions yesterday
seemed to indicate that old Jupe
Pluviu.s had ceased his recent ob
streperous conduct to give local
poloists a break this afternoon for
the first of their two-game series
with the University of Utah mallet
wielders.
The contest, which marks the first
intercollegiate polo encounter of the
season on the campus, will get under
way at 3 o'clock on the highway field,
according to Lt. H. Y. Grubbs, Stan
lord coach.
Visitors Arrive
The visiting riders, seven strong,
accompanied by their coach, Lt. R.
M. Cannon, arrived last night and
are being accommodated at various
houses on the campus.
No definite knowledge as to the
ability of the visitors is known by
Lt. Grubbs, though rumor has it that
the Salt Lake lads have quite a re
spectable outfit, which should give
the powerful Indian quartet consid
erable trouble before the series is
over.
Rasmussen Returns
Lt. Grubbs' outfit has been greatly
strengthened by the reappearance of
the veteran Russ Rasmussen, who
saw regular service on last season's
championship quartet. Rasmussen
will be back at his old No. 3 position
this afternoon and the remainder of
the Card line-up, according to Lt.
Grubbs, will find Carl Beal at No. 1
position, Captain Bill Rogers at No.
2, and Bob Fullerton at No. 4.
Lt. Grubbs has available a quartet
of able substitutes who will see
service against the visitors unless the
going gets too tough. These reserves
include Bill Enemark, Jim Hender
son, John Dwyer, and Ed McKeon.
Will Swap Horses
As the local stables will have to
mount the visitors for the games, Lt.
Grubbs has arranged to have a "di
rect switch" of pony strings be
tween the two teams at half time.
This will insure fairness to the Utah
players in the way of desirable
mounts.
Admission to this afternoon's game
will be free, according to PJanager
Fred Bold, and a thrilling game will
be offered. There is plenty of park
ing space available around the field
for spectators' cars.
The Utah line-up will be as
follows: No. 1, Elwood Walker; No.
2, Captain Arthur Pratt; No, 3, C. If.
Wilchen; No. 4, Don Thompson;
coach, Lieutenant Cannon.
