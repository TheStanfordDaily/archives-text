## Revision 53h— Big meet dope sheet 
### 
Track nu'.. and those afflicted with
a craving for doping athletic con
tests are already in a heyday over
the impending Big Meet, due a week
from Saturday. Yet California has
had so much publicity and so many
opportunities to display its strengths
and weaknesses and Stanford so
little, in both cases, that the picking
is open to even more than the
usual suctioning.
However, this track nut it» crazy
enough to reveal his dope sheet
now, allowing ten days for the
dissenters to he duly heard and
also for possible revisions. Here's
No. 1, revision 53b of the Stanford
Daily Big Meet dope sheet:
100-yard dash — Anderson (C.);
Pollock (C.); Dean (S.).
220-yard dash — Anderson (C.);
Voigt (S.); Pollock (C.;.
440-yard dash — Blackmail (S.);
Helrnar (C.); Leek (C.).'
880-yard run —Brace (C:); March
(S.); Hickerson (C.).
Mile run — Nimmo (S.); Dixon
(S.); Heavy (C.).
Two-mile run —Fowler (C.); Dev
lin (S.); Voorhees (C.).

Broad jump—Pollock (C.); Tharp

Relay—Stanford.
Oh yes, one more point. The
score: Stanford 05, California <i(i.
The next step is to peacefully
subside under the protection of nu
merous "if" and "but" clauses, which,
of course, is merely to save the
trouble of throwing out the whole
thing and starting all over again.
Sure sore points:
The mile: Cal supporters will
sowl to see Nininio and Dixon,
who have yet to break 4:25. placed
ahead of Heavy, who ran under
4:21 last Saturday. The answer:
they both will outsprint Heavy in
the home stretch.
220-yard dash: About ten yards
separated Anderson and Pollock at
the finish in Los Angeles last Sat
urday, which is room enough for
Voigt to break up the Cal combi
nation.
The hurdles: Moore won and
Fishback wis just barely nosed
out against the Trojans, and both
have considerably better times
than Klopstock. All we can say
is that Klopstock is a great com
petitor and the faster the field
goes the faster Sam goes, and Sam
g-ves fast enough to win.
More troubles are promised. The
dopesters have hardly started yet.
Revision 54a of our own design is
already in the making.

is that Klopstock is a great com
petitor and the faster the field
goes the faster Sam goes, and Sam
g-ves fast enough to win.

dopesters have hardly started yet.

Track nu'.. and those afflicted with
a craving for doping athletic con
tests are already in a heyday over
the impending Big Meet, due a week
from Saturday. Yet California has
had so much publicity and so many
opportunities to display its strengths
and weaknesses and Stanford so
little, in both cases, that the picking
is open to even more than the
usual suctioning.
However, this track nut it» crazy
enough to reveal his dope sheet
now, allowing ten days for the
dissenters to he duly heard and
also for possible revisions. Here's
No. 1, revision 53b of the Stanford
Daily Big Meet dope sheet:
100-yard dash — Anderson (C.);
Pollock (C.); Dean (S.).
220-yard dash — Anderson (C.);
Voigt (S.); Pollock (C.;.
440-yard dash — Blackmail (S.);
Helrnar (C.); Leek (C.).'
880-yard run —Brace (C:); March
(S.); Hickerson (C.).
Mile run — Nimmo (S.); Dixon
(S.); Heavy (C.).
Two-mile run —Fowler (C.); Dev
lin (S.); Voorhees (C.).
High hurdles — Klopstock (S.);
Moore (C.); Wood (C.).
Low hurdles — Klopstock (S.);
Fishback (C.); Moore (C.).
Shot put —Reynolds (S.); Mackey
(C.); Meek (C.).
Discus —Levy (S.); King (S.); Ran
dell (C.).
Pole vault — Mauger (C.); Has
kell (C.); Anderson (S.).

High jump—Smith (S.); Reid (C.)j
Thompson (C.); and Jacques (C.).
Broad jump—Pollock (C.); Tharp
(S.); Vallejo (C).
Javelin—Mottram (S.); Fink (C.);
Fitzgerald (C.).
Relay—Stanford.
Oh yes, one more point. The
score: Stanford 05, California <i(i.
The next step is to peacefully
subside under the protection of nu
merous "if" and "but" clauses, which,
of course, is merely to save the
trouble of throwing out the whole
thing and starting all over again.
Sure sore points:
The mile: Cal supporters will
sowl to see Nininio and Dixon,
who have yet to break 4:25. placed
ahead of Heavy, who ran under
4:21 last Saturday. The answer:
they both will outsprint Heavy in
the home stretch.
220-yard dash: About ten yards
separated Anderson and Pollock at
the finish in Los Angeles last Sat
urday, which is room enough for
Voigt to break up the Cal combi
nation.
The hurdles: Moore won and
Fishback wis just barely nosed
out against the Trojans, and both
have considerably better times
than Klopstock. All we can say
is that Klopstock is a great com
petitor and the faster the field
goes the faster Sam goes, and Sam
g-ves fast enough to win.
