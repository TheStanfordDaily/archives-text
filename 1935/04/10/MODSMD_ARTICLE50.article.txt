# DINK PESSIMISTIC AS U.C.L.A. TEST NEARS FOR CARDS
## Track Squad Leaves For Los Angeles Friday 
### 
Robert Lyman Templeton has al
most become resigned to his fate,
but he can't quite refrain from sing
ing the blues as his team, 24 strong
("il we can find enough men we
don't mind showing in public"), go
through heavy afternoon sweat ses
sions preparatory to a tour south
ward for purposes of testing strength
against U.C.LA.
The squad will leave Friday eve
ning on the Sunset lor Los Angeles
to compete in Olympic Stadium Sat
urday afternoon.
Competition Needed
A few disappointing time trials, the
last to be held before the Big Meet
with California in ten days, have
taken place on the soggy Angel 1
Field track during the past two
days. Templeton claims disinterest
with regard to the outcome of the
Bruin meet; what he is after is to
give his Indian varsity just one little
bit of real competition before it as
sails Edwards Field and some highly
potent Golden Bears.
His team is fairly well rounded
for its fnvjt outdoor meet in the
track'events, but many of the field
departments have folded into sur
prising insignificance.
Broad Jumpers Out
Major among the current worries
are the broad jump, pole vault, and
sprints. George Tharp is still both
ered with a leg injury, and Robin
Lindsey has left school. This takes
care of the available broad jumpers.
Van Ginn and Arne Anderson are
still considerably off form in the pole
vault, and Templeton can see little
or no hopes in this department. Ray
Dean, splinter, becau.se of tight
muscles, probably will not be able
to compete in the dashes, so Chuck
Voigt, a potential 440-yard man, has
been temporarily moved back into
the shorter races.
