# FROSH TRACKMAN MARES GOOD TOSS
## 
### 
Ottn Beringer, frosh track weight
man, has given indication that his
discus throw efforts could be count
| ea on to net the yearling squad
I advantage over their opponents for
| the remaining two meets of the sea-
I son.
! The hefty weight-slinger gave the
i discuss an air ride of 146 feet 7V2
| inches early this week and has con
| sistently put the shot 42 feet. Glenn
j Hamilton, Beringer's contestant for
i shot-put honors, has been slow in
' reaching his peak, putting the iron
marble slightly over 40 feet as his
best effort to date.
