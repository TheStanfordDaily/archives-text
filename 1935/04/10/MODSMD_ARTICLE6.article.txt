# Gertrude Stein Talks Tonight
## 
### 
Gertrude Stein, noted authoress,
will be presented this evening at 8
'o'clock in the Dance Studio of the
Women's Gymnasium, under the
auspices of the English Club. Her
.subject will be "How Writing Is
Written."
Miss Stein wrote the text of the
opera "Four Saints in Three Acts,"
from which are taken the well
known lines:
"Pigeons on the grass, alas
Alas, alas, pigeons on the grass."
She is also the author of the
much discussed "Autobiography of
Alice B. Tokias," which many be
lieve to be the story of her own life,
although the title name is that of
her secretary.
Miss Stein's manner of lecturing is
said to be more intelligible than her
writings seem to the average reader,
although she sometimes lapses into
her usual literary style.
Tickets have already been sold out.
