# BULL SESSION
## GOSSIP VIA TELEPHONEY 
### 
As winter quarter drew to a close, |
Stanford students sweated through a '
week of blistering finals. Down in t
San Jose, a former Stanford student !
—David Lamson—was also sweating, j
Over the heads of the Stanford stu- !
dents hung the ominous shadow of j
the dreaded flunk. Over the head of !
the former Stanford student was j
suspended the hangman's noose.
For month after month the weary >
court battle had dragged along. Now
the testimony was dull routine; now
it was wildly sensational; at all times
the press had grabbed the tiniest j
morsels of scandal, stirred them '
around, peppered them with the :
name of "Stanford," and served the j
hash up as "news'' to an emotionally I
starved public. The first trial had j
been faulty. The new trial was re
peating the whole of the jumbled
fact and fiction of the first.
As winter quarter drew to a close,
an operator on ihe Stanford central j
telephone switchboard mounted the
witness stand to testify. She swore |
that because of a faulty wire con
nection she had inadvertently lis
tened in on part of a telephone con
versation months before, had heard
the familiar voice of David Lamson
speak words of endearment to the j
Sacramento woman known as Kelley. 1
The court was stunned. The papers
were gleeful.
One wonders at the motivation of I
the telephone operator. One won- j
ders at the coincidental nature of the |

| service trouble. One wonders at the
! remarkable memory of the woman
j who could remember a voice and a
| conversation over a period of months.
; One wonders at the long silence,
I and the sudden outburst of the op
; erator. But ono wonders most of all
j that an operator charged with the
j safe conduct of a message as surely
jas is a postman, should violate the
| moral ethics, if not the actual laws
i of her profession.
If the voice which the operator
claims to have heard was indeed
the voice of David Lamson, it was
| Lamson's right to say what he pleas
|ed on that phone—unhampered by
! prying friends or malicious enemies.
| If, as the spirit of American and
I English law seem to indicate, "a
J man's house is his castle," it would
seem to follow that a private tele
phone conversation also must be
I held inviolate. Otherwise a man's
house is not his castle, but a grand
j central depot—teeming with gossip
; mongers, eaves-droppers, and fer
| rets.
When Dr. Alexander Graham Bell
blessed the world with the telephone,
little did he know that he was but
giving the female gossip new worlds
Ito conquer. Sad it is that the in
-1 vention which rings the friends, calls
the doctor, and makes indisposition
a pleasure should be perverted to
j serve the ends of wire-tapping op-
I erators. Stanford is no place for such
| telephones.

As winter quarter drew to a close, |

Over the heads of the Stanford stu- !
dents hung the ominous shadow of j
the dreaded flunk. Over the head of !
the former Stanford student was j
suspended the hangman's noose.
For month after month the weary >
court battle had dragged along. Now
the testimony was dull routine; now
it was wildly sensational; at all times
the press had grabbed the tiniest j
morsels of scandal, stirred them '
around, peppered them with the :
name of "Stanford," and served the j
hash up as "news'' to an emotionally I
starved public. The first trial had j
been faulty. The new trial was re
peating the whole of the jumbled
fact and fiction of the first.
As winter quarter drew to a close,
an operator on ihe Stanford central j
telephone switchboard mounted the
witness stand to testify. She swore |
that because of a faulty wire con
nection she had inadvertently lis
tened in on part of a telephone con
versation months before, had heard
the familiar voice of David Lamson
speak words of endearment to the j
Sacramento woman known as Kelley. 1
The court was stunned. The papers
were gleeful.
