# CAMPUS OPINION
## STILL LIKES ARLISS 
### 
' The Editor, Sir:
In regard to the recent review of
! "The Iron Duke" might I suggest
! that you investigate as to just what
H. G. Lowe (the commentator) con
, siders a comedy and also just what
j he expects a motion picture to con
i lain so that it will not be classified
as "dull." In brief, I think that ihe
| review itself was "damnable" (to
I adopt the reporter's own peculiarity
1 of expression).
Mr. Arliss is noted for his ability
| to extract the last drop of comedy
■ from obvious situations by an in
i tonation of his voice, by a sly pause,
| or by a timely subtle gesture, and
his latest picture proves to be no
I exception. But because Arliss will
I not tear a passion to tatters or split
I the ears of the groundlings, the
i ''shicks" and "shebas" class his pic-
I tures as "dull."
Your critic stated that Arliss'
Wellington suffers by comparison
! with C. Aubrey Smith's characteri
zation in "The House of Rothschild."
Arliss isn't the reporter's eoncep
| tion of Wellington, but — come to
think of it —what is his conception?
! I'm willing to wager that "that prc-
I cise, studied little man with the
j monocle" (reviewer's phraseology)
; knows a great deal more about Wel
j lington's life, his features and his

habits, than your reporter, who, in
all probability, never even so much
as read a biography of the British
general, or saw his portrait.
Moreover, to say "that precise,
studied little man" is rather stupid
sarcasm. Arliss can't move you, as
some great players can, by the ex
cess and confusion of his own emo
tion. In "The Iron Duke" it is not
his physique, nor the swelling nat
ural flow of his emotion that im
presses you, but rather the forcc of
his art and intellect. Every detail so
well worked out, every word and
gesture so exquisitely timed, Ihe
pregnant pause, the quick fluent
transitions, and above all the feel
ing he engenders of a man who nat
urally dominates through the clear
ness of his intellectual processes.
Such acting not only dignifies the
film itself but the entire profession
for it demonstrates that acting can
be almost purely an art.
In "The Iron Duke" Arliss could
be at his worst, but he would still

be better than 90 per cent of the
actors who strut across the screen.
The picture is not monumental (I
don't think that one wants that every
time he attends a theatre) but it has
a sane sense of values and also has
in the lead one of the grandest act
oi's that ever donned make-up.
