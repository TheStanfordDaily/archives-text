Tlie sponsoring council gathers

The history of this institute dates
back to 1926 when a group of men

first conference which was success
fully held, and every year since,
meetings have been held during the
Thanksgiving holidays.

tional, religious and social groups
come together for serious and fruit
ful discussion of the current prob
lems facing the peoples of the Pa

cific.
