# Endowment Committee Solicits Senior Pledges
## 
### 
Seniors in all living groups will be
solicited for pledges to the senior
class scholarship fund this week and
next, according to Gordon Mallatratt,
endowment committee chairman.
The customary senior class gift
will again be a scholarship, to be
used in aiding some needy student
through the University, according to
a decision reached by the committee
last quarter. The fund will be made
up of contributions in the form of
pledge cards, with any amount to be
paid annually.
