### 
Whoa!
Several score baseball fans
stood up yesterday and bel
lowed this imperative horse
phrase — not at the diamond
but at a gaudily garbed polo
player who seemed just a little
out of bounds.
Utah *7id Stanford were play
ing a polo game on the highway
field, hut here was a player
riding pell mell past the sunken
diamond three or four field
lengths away from his fel
lows.
Horse, it seems, didn't feel
like stopping when he reached
the edge of the polo field
Whoas and violent bridle jerk
ings were of no avail to the
Utah player in the saddle. And
the horse-hockey pony just
kept on going until he felt like
stopping, leaving the ball crowd
hilarious and the polo players
fiat-footed.
