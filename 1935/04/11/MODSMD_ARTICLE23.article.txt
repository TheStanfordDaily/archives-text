# No Cases for Campus Cops Says Police Force Night Owl

### ROBERT EISENBACH 
Sherlock Holmes would die of co- | fj
I caine poisoning, Philo Vance would
jitter from a plus charge of Regis I
j cigarettes, if they were assigned to j
j night police duty on the Stanford 1
! campus, believes Sheriff George i
Burns. He hasn't had a good mys-
I tery for years.
George is pretty fat for a figure of
I justice, though he works from 6 in ( |
; the evening to 6 in the morning. !
But he's not blind, as justice is con
| ventionally pictured. He has eyes ; i
j like a cat's so he can spot prank
i sters, loiterers, second-story men,
and second-story women, locked in
j the night air by a lock-out.
i His last big case was the Frehe
1 ducknaping. George rates it. top
spot along with the Rue Morgue and
Charlie Ross cases. Ducks that were
.stolen one night from the golf
course duckery of Sheriff Fred
Frehe were found messing in the
Pi Phi kitchen, returned to the
Frehe metropolitan duckery, then
I ducknHpped again.
Some say it was Fire Chief Du
gan, others believe that Chief
Painter Lee C. Webb was the man,
but investigators are sure. "Webb's
shop was full of feathers, duck
I feathers," Burns whispered dramat- j

! ically. Incidentally, the S.A.E. boys
: took the fowl in the first place, but
, George calls such information rou
tine stuff.
Since then the campus has been
morgue-like. Students don't even
neck in the cactus gardens any
more, and I sure learned a lot from
them," he declares.
Hell Week i.s George's time for
high-powered rat-racing. Among
the things he returns after in
itiation soirees are Guernsey bulls,
female toads, fenders from Stanley
Steamers, and linotype machines.
His years of participation in frater
nity life have given him sufficient
material to write a book. It's to be
called "Initiation Practices," and it
should be good — particularly the
part that can't be printed.
With spring upon him, George is
inventing ways to enjoy the quiet
legality of the campus. He suggests
wholesale tea parties at the fire
house. "We could pump the tea
through hoses,'' he points out, "and
not even have to pass our cups."
Chief Dugan will receive the sug
gestion in a few days. "He'd better
say yes," George declared, "or I'll
• blast his part of the ducknaping
I case wide open."

female toads, fenders from Stanley

His years of participation in frater

should be good — particularly the
part that can't be printed.
With spring upon him, George is
inventing ways to enjoy the quiet
legality of the campus. He suggests
wholesale tea parties at the fire
house. "We could pump the tea
through hoses,'' he points out, "and
not even have to pass our cups."
Chief Dugan will receive the sug
