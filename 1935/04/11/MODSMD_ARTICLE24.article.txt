# Stein Stein Is Clear to Big Crowd Crowd
## Changes Topic Talks On Literature Language 
### Phil Bernheim 
Appropriately enough, a bird Hew !'
oround the Dance Studio of the j
Women's Gymnasium during Ger- ,
trutlc Stein's lecture last night. Of 11
course, it wasn't exactly given to j;
her, but it was (here none the less, 1
and it caught the audience's hnagi- !
nation. It. swooped around in fright- |,
ened circles while Miss Stein talked j
imperturbably on.
ChaAges Topic
Nothing perturbed her. Laughter '
fazed her not in the least. She came I
nut and .said, "I'm supposed to tall:
to you about how writing is written,
but instead I'm going to read you a
le'cture on the relation of English
literature to American language." Ii
And she proceeded to do so, pausing i
from time to time to interpolate!
lengthy extemporaneous remarks |
which sometimes bore small relation ,
to her main topic.
Although she spoke with an un- |
conventional style, it was not un- j
intelligible. The manuscript portions
of her talk had more of what one j
usually expects from Stein in them j
than did the extemporaneous re- |
marks, but, withal, she spoke much
that was sense. Although you might !
not agree with the way she said it j
you could hardly help but get what 'â– 
she was driving at.
Defends Artists
An,artist, she said, expresses the
spirit of his time, but he usually is j
not appreciated because most people I
are living, aesthetically, 40 years ago. !
It causes less mental strain, she ex- j
plained, to think of things as they j
were 40 years ago.
Again defending the artist, she 1
stated unequivocally that artists '
were the only ones with common !
sense because they were the only 1
ones that realized that all things j
were natural things. Most people
think most things are unnatural j
things, and they are shocked when '
they learn that all things are natural j
things. (All right, but it sounded j
o.k. when she said it.)
Gives War Views
Then she gave her own views on j
what causes war. It is due, she says, i
to a natural resistance to the "ac- j
ceptation" of a change which has;
already taken place. Translating, ]
she means (I think) that certain j
changes take place in the world, i
people educated 40 years ago refuse j
1o recognize' them and act accord-j
ingly, and war results. Or is that I
just as bad as the original?
When she got to the subject of \
repetition, the audience laughed ex- I
pectantly, and she displayed her j
own sense of humor by laughing
with it. But though she recognized '
the fact that her ideas are often con- :
sidered queer, she nevertheless I
showed by her manor lhat she was]
j sincere in them.
Funnies Repeat i
Everything is repetition, she said, t
citing the funny papers as one ex- |
j ample: "We couldn't go on day after j
i day reading them if they weren't the '
! same thing in just a slightly differ- 1
i ont way." All life is repetition, with
! only infinite variation, but because
j we are used to it, we do not realize
i it. It is only when we hear somc
i thing really new for the second time
jthat it seems like repetition to us,
