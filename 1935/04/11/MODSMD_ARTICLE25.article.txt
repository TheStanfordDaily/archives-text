# Roosevelt-Hull Forming Neutrality Plan for U.S.

### 
WASHINGTON, April 10 (/P). —A
strict neutrality policy to keep
, America free from entanglements in
j foreign wars w.»s shaped today by
] President Roosevelt and Secretary
| Hull.
The latter curried to the While
, House ihe results of a still incom
plete exploration of the intricate
problems involved. His depart
mental aides have been conducting
the study, which is to be made the
! basis for such a policy, for nearly a
i year.
or at least to her.
The whole key to her distinctive
style seems to lie in the fact that
she is obsessed with the idea of
movement. The English language,
as the English use it, seems static to
her. It was to express movement, to
make the language move, that she
abandoned the use of punctuation
and substituted the use of present
participles for nouns wherever pos
sible.
Seek Form
She showed how English life,
from which the language evolved, is
greatly different from ours. Amer
icans, she insisted, try to say in their
writings something which the lan
guage was not designed to say, and
since the words are given to us and
we must accept them, it is only by
experimenting with the use of words
that we can find out how to say what
we are trying to say.
The great thing which Americans
must find is their own distneitive
form, neither poetry nor prose, which
are the old forms.
Punctuation Superfluous
In an informal interview after the
lecture, she repeated what she had
told San Francisco reporters Tues
day and what she had said in her lec
ture about punctuation; namely, that
"if you need punctuation you're
feeble-minded."
"But punctuation makes it eas
ier," insisted the Daily reporter with
characteristic Daily tenaciousness.
"Why make it harder to under
stand?"
"A little work never hurt any
body," snorted La Stein. "A writer
writes himself on paper; it doesn't
matter whether or not anybody un
derstands him."
