## Powers Accept Germany's Rearmament, but See Need for Security LITHUANIA SORE SPOT Attempt to Avert Baltic War by Pressure 
### 
STRESA, April 10 (JP).—Decided
differences of opinion among Brit
ish, French and Italian delegations
as to the best way of insuring Eu
rope against war was indicated to
night on eve of their conference here,
regarded as the most important since
the World War.
While the three powers arc agreed
upon accepting Germany's rearma
ment and upon the necessity of get
ting the Reich into some system of
non-aggression and security, they
were authoritatively reported sharp
ly at odds as to the methods to be
followed.
France on Fence
Great Britain and Italy, the best
informed quarters said, are at op
posite extremes, with the French
somewhere in between them but
probably closer to Britain.
A British spokesman tonight in
dicated Britain's desire to remove
one possible future peril to the
Continent's peace, saying status of
Memel—lopped off from Germany
after the war and now held by Lith
uania — would undoubtedly form
one topic of conversation.
Presume Tried
The discussion, it was indicated,
will concern what pressure the three
powers can bring to bear on Lith
uania to prevent conflict between
the Reich and the Baltic nation.
Meanwhile, foreign observers in
Moscow placed great significance on
signing of the Russo-German trade
accord yesterday in view of an ar
ticle in the government organ Izves
tia Monday that a move to sidetrack
the eastern security pact might
force nations of eastern Europe to
make their "own deals."
