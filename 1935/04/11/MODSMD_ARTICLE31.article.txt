### 
Starling something new in the academic
life ou the barm, President Uay Lyman W ilbur
tonight inaugurates the first ol a series ol
lectures in the Women's clubhouse.
It was not so long ago, from 1 to 1932,
that Dr. Wilbur was president of Stanford
I'niversilv on leave, and directed the policies
of the University from bis desk in Washing
ton, DC., where he was Secretary of the In
terior.
During the time that Dr. Wilbur was away,
a:i entire class went throughout its four year
period on the campus without ever coming
into actual personal contact with the presi
dent of the University.
Now, biwever, and since 193.'}, the tendency
oi the administration has been to attempt a
closer relationship with the students enrolled
on the Farm, and it is with this aim in mind
that Dr. Wilbur assumes leadership in this
series of discussion groups.
The president of the Associated Students
and the Kxccutive Committee sponsor a worth
while project in the series ol informal dis
cussions. The present day trend in education
is to acquaint students upon subjects in which
they are interested by having them discuss
problems with men who have already had
practical contacts with a'world outside of
campus confines.
Many who are ignorant of the interesting
events which resulted in the founding ol Stan
lord University would do well to listen to
President Wilbur, who speaks on a subject he
knows intimately. And in the future, students
themselves will have a voice in determining
what thev want discussed.
