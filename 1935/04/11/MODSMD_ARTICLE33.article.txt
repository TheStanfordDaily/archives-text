# "There Was An Error Somewhere"

### 
"There was an error somewhere along the
■way." This is the lotal result so Car of an
investigation into the "mistake" hanging
Friday ot Hush (Iriffin, 19-year-dld eonviet
who had appealed Iron) a death sentence.
The fact that a human life was taken
illegally by the State of California simply
through the negligence of a minor official in
forgetting to forward a slay of execution
order to the prison, is a pitiful example of in
efficiency; inefficiency by which a human life
was snuffed out while the terrified victim
sobbed that his attorney "must have been
joking" when he said an appeal had been
tiled.
Various actions are suggested. Certainly
the slide, prison officials, and the county
clerk's office have left themselves open to
several large damage suils. One San Fran
cisco newspaper even suggests that the official
who was responsible should iose his job!
A tremendously effective solution, no doubt,
for a loose system of justice which each year
has custody over the lives and liberties of
thousands of convicts.
A bill introduced into the legislature would
correct the defect which probably led to this
colossal error, requiring the forwarding of
stays of execution by telegraph.
Hut no bill, no discharging of employees, no
judgment for damages can remedy such situa
tions. No rules can instill i»i those who work
for the public a sense of responsibility and a
realization of their duty to thousands of
citizens.
In the lack of Ibis intangible spirit lies the
cause not only of hist Friday's fiasco, but also
countless other "mistakes" which bring gov
< rmuenf info contempt.
