# Bridge Building Is Dangerous

Those who believe that the structural
growth of the great Oakland-San Francisco
bay bridge project is going on with a minimum
of injuries and deaths are vastly wrong.
Fleven men have been killed, almost four

ten hundred injured, and of these, live hun
dred and fifty seven so seriously that they
cannot return to work on the bridge.
'i hese appalling figures of death and in
jury prove conclusively thai modern bridge
spanning cannot he accomplished without
great hazard of life. Human life is all-loo
ollen considered a negligible element in a
modern engineering society, hut the com
mission which Monday ordered an investiga

realizes that something is being overlooked
when so many hundreds of men have been
permanently shelved.
I he bay bridge is a state-controlled project.
In contrast to this, the tiolden (late bridge,
winch is under ditferent control, has not yet
recorded a single death or major accident.
'I bis disparity of accident and death figures
between the two bridges is the external evi
dence o! a rotten condition somewhere, and
it is the duly ol the "state experts" who have
called a conference, to find a remedy for these
accidents.
