## ALASKA: NORTHERN WONDERLAND—EELLS 
### CEDRIC LARSON 
"Walrussia," "America's Ice Box" and similar ap
pellatives were bestowed on Alaska by contemporary
wits when in 1867 Seward acquired from the Czar for
$7,200,000 title to some 586,400 square miles of the ter
ritory in tiie far north.
Unknown and unwanted, the vast area remained
practically unexplored until the bonanza Klondike-
Yukon gold rush of '98 brought a flood of fortune
seekers into the vastnesses of its interior. Even today
its boundless riches remain untapped, awaiting the
initiative of the hardy adventurer.
Into this wild and inhospitable region penetrated
two investigators of Stanford University—Dr. Walter
Crosby Eel Is and Dr. H. Dewey Ai tderson—bound on a
mission of adding to the present all too meager fund
of information of this territory. Neither pains or ex
pense were spared to do a thorough job, and finally
today, at a cost upwards of $50,000, met in part by a
grant from the Carnegie Corporation of New York, the
most comprehensive survey ever made of Alaska's
aborigines comes from the Stanford University Press:
"Alaska Natives,' 'a richly qocumented 472-page
volume.
The Stanford research workers covered between
them upwards of 28,000 miles "by steamer, gasoline
boat, native boat, coast guard cutter, airplane, dog
team, or railroad" to to complete the study. Alaska
B as a 3500-mile coast, with a btfitudinal range
from 57 degrees to 71 degrees, the latter latitude
being nearly 300 miles north of the Arctic circle.
If superimposed on a map of the United States,
Alaska would extend from San Francisco to Sa
vannah, and from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
Dr. Eells explains that there are three different types
of native peoples: Eskimos, Aleuts, and Indians, who
altogether number about 30,000. The Eskimos live
chiefly along the coastline, where they eke out a pre
carious livelihood from such food as the sea affords.
The Indians live mainly in the interior of Alaska and
the Aleuts inhabit the Aleutian chain.
Among these primitive people the two Stanford
educators worked. The United States maintains schools
for the natives while separate territorial schools are
established for the children of the 28.000 whites living
in Alaska.
With the advent of schools and contacts- with
civilization, the AHska native is gradually chang
ing his habits and customs, states Dr. Eells. The
aborigines are rapidly shedding their superstitious
leliefs in the potent magic of shaman and witch
doctor, and are willing and eager for their chil
dren to have educational advantages. The Stan
forditcs made 124 recommendations to improve the
native school system.
Professor Eells states that the United States gov
ernment has just begun a far-reaching program to
help these people and develop Alaska. In the north
ern and western part of the territory there are 200,000
square miles of treeless region, unsuited to agriculture,
but capable of furnishing pasturage for millions of
reindeer. Already there are more than 700,000 reindeer
in Alaska, worth $9,000,000, many herds being owned
by natives. From these animals the natives furnish
themselves with both food and clothing, and maintain
a large measure of security.
With the American government sponsoring both
education and economic independence among the na
tive population, there is much reason to feel that their
future is an encouraging one, concludes Dr. Eells.

two investigators of Stanford University—Dr. Walter
Crosby Eel Is and Dr. H. Dewey Ai tderson—bound on a
mission of adding to the present all too meager fund
of information of this territory. Neither pains or ex
pense were spared to do a thorough job, and finally
today, at a cost upwards of $50,000, met in part by a
grant from the Carnegie Corporation of New York, the
most comprehensive survey ever made of Alaska's
aborigines comes from the Stanford University Press:
"Alaska Natives,' 'a richly qocumented 472-page
volume.
The Stanford research workers covered between
them upwards of 28,000 miles "by steamer, gasoline
boat, native boat, coast guard cutter, airplane, dog
team, or railroad" to to complete the study. Alaska
B as a 3500-mile coast, with a btfitudinal range
from 57 degrees to 71 degrees, the latter latitude
being nearly 300 miles north of the Arctic circle.
If superimposed on a map of the United States,
Alaska would extend from San Francisco to Sa
vannah, and from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
Dr. Eells explains that there are three different types
of native peoples: Eskimos, Aleuts, and Indians, who
altogether number about 30,000. The Eskimos live
chiefly along the coastline, where they eke out a pre
carious livelihood from such food as the sea affords.
The Indians live mainly in the interior of Alaska and
the Aleuts inhabit the Aleutian chain.
Among these primitive people the two Stanford
educators worked. The United States maintains schools
for the natives while separate territorial schools are
established for the children of the 28.000 whites living
in Alaska.
With the advent of schools and contacts- with
civilization, the AHska native is gradually chang
ing his habits and customs, states Dr. Eells. The
aborigines are rapidly shedding their superstitious
leliefs in the potent magic of shaman and witch
doctor, and are willing and eager for their chil
dren to have educational advantages. The Stan
forditcs made 124 recommendations to improve the
native school system.
Professor Eells states that the United States gov
ernment has just begun a far-reaching program to
help these people and develop Alaska. In the north
ern and western part of the territory there are 200,000
square miles of treeless region, unsuited to agriculture,
but capable of furnishing pasturage for millions of
reindeer. Already there are more than 700,000 reindeer
in Alaska, worth $9,000,000, many herds being owned
by natives. From these animals the natives furnish
themselves with both food and clothing, and maintain
a large measure of security.
With the American government sponsoring both
education and economic independence among the na
tive population, there is much reason to feel that their
future is an encouraging one, concludes Dr. Eells.
"Walrussia," "America's Ice Box" and similar ap
pellatives were bestowed on Alaska by contemporary
wits when in 1867 Seward acquired from the Czar for
$7,200,000 title to some 586,400 square miles of the ter
ritory in tiie far north.
Unknown and unwanted, the vast area remained
practically unexplored until the bonanza Klondike-
Yukon gold rush of '98 brought a flood of fortune
seekers into the vastnesses of its interior. Even today
its boundless riches remain untapped, awaiting the
initiative of the hardy adventurer.
