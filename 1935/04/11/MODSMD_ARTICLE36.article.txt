# OUR HASHER SEZ:

It has been rumored in authoritative circles that
there is a cook at Ruble who is a member of Kappa
Alpha Theta sorority. It is said she was a member
back East but has not affiliated here—perhaps because
the Thetas wish to have her do all their rushing for
them.
That is really something new in women's rushing.
The hashers have been offering for years to do all the
women's rushing lor them. They guarantee to round
up the cream of the class it allowed only a part of the
money ordinarily expended on rushing for "expenses."
There is a movement afoot to have a Row caucus
to decide on the Row nominees for women officers in
the spring A.S.S.U. election. But it would be really
more sensible to have a Row caucus for rushing.
Every house would be allotted a certain number of
pledges, and then they could all get together and de
cide the thing in a fair, just, and human way. There
could be lantern slides of all the girls, or the freshman
could file past on a runway, exhibiting all the latest
gowns, or bathing suits. When a girl is decided upon,
somebody would pull a lever, and she would drop into
the pen for the right house. This would modernize all
difficulties now attendant to our capitalistic system
and positively eliminate the social lag. Do you feel that
social lag?—get a lift with a camel.
I have a much better idea for men's rushing. In
planning these clever machines of mine, I take into
consideration the use to which they must be put.
Therefore, I must change my machine from the wom
en's machine. Instead of the fashion show, the men's
Row caucus would have a great engine with revolving
screens. The freshmen would be fed in from the top.
Those who are biggest will stick in the coarsest screen,
and they would join the number one fraternity, and
so on down. My research department shows that
there is a positive correlation Between size and football
playing and an inverse correlation for. English majors
and members of the library club. So everything
: hould be very satisfactory and a homogeneous group
would be gathered together.
Those infilterable viruses (or is it viri) who pass
completely through my machine could become intel
lectual liberals and free-thinkers and espouse rs of
unpoptifar causes.

could be lantern slides of all the girls, or the freshman
could file past on a runway, exhibiting all the latest
gowns, or bathing suits. When a girl is decided upon,
somebody would pull a lever, and she would drop into
the pen for the right house. This would modernize all
difficulties now attendant to our capitalistic system
and positively eliminate the social lag. Do you feel that
social lag?—get a lift with a camel.
I have a much better idea for men's rushing. In
planning these clever machines of mine, I take into
consideration the use to which they must be put.
Therefore, I must change my machine from the wom
en's machine. Instead of the fashion show, the men's
Row caucus would have a great engine with revolving
screens. The freshmen would be fed in from the top.
Those who are biggest will stick in the coarsest screen,
and they would join the number one fraternity, and
so on down. My research department shows that
there is a positive correlation Between size and football
playing and an inverse correlation for. English majors
and members of the library club. So everything
: hould be very satisfactory and a homogeneous group
would be gathered together.
Those infilterable viruses (or is it viri) who pass
completely through my machine could become intel
lectual liberals and free-thinkers and espouse rs of
unpoptifar causes.
