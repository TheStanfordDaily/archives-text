| The Editor, Sir:
Although Miss Polcar arid I differ
1 greatly in our conception of what I
i constitutes a good photoplay, she |
j tnd I are in mutual accord on this: j
1 our reverence for George Arliss. To i
! me, this performer represents to the |
highest degree the man of intellect, '
i who conquers by persuasion rather I
\ than force, and who yet is able to
| present himself to the crowd in such [
! a way that it can appreciate him and j
vvhat he stands for.
And so it was with misgivings that j
I watched George Arli.-,s desert his ,
colors by playing Wellington. It was ■
]as if Chaplin acted Hamlet. More j
| than a brusque voice is needed to |
! make a soldier, and more than ad- !
jacent trumpets to suggest a leader j
-of men. Arliss, for the first time, j
' seemed artificial, because he van- i
tured into a world in which he did
n't belong.
I feel that '"The Iron Duke" is dull |
! because it does not bring '•a fresh |
' point of view toward the material it
j covers, because its director fails to !
i organically connect the people and I
, the plot and make the whole seem
| significant, and because many of the
J performances are forced and un
! natural, particularly those of the
j Duchess of Richmond and the Duch- j
j ess of Wellington.
j The film is a British production. !
i The British seem to be able to make :
j good films only when they employ i
I Hollywood people, and in this case j
| Mr. Arliss was the sole Hollywood
| importation. At that, he might have !
seen to it that his photographer
I moved his camera about occasion- :
I ally, and that his supporting players
did not obstruct each other on the
sets. Mr. Arliss ought never to have !
appeared with this inefficient com- ;
| pany, particularly when attempting
to play Wellington. The foremost J
film critics here and in England will |
bear me out on this point. Mr. Ar-
I liss hoped to be knighted by virtue i
jof this effort, and it now appears j
J that he not only will not be knighted
| but his producers will lose a fortune j
on the film.

! The Editor, Sir:
The subject of journalistic ethics \
is so vague as to make the present
inquiry much more of a petty tenta- j
tive than an outraged attack. Yet i
there is a question.
Is it the practice of The Daily to !
print paraphrases of articles printed
j elsewhere without the customary j
j acknowledgement?
The reference is, specifically, to '
the feature article on page 1 of <
Wednesday's paper describing Ger- '
trude Stein. As every constant !
reader of The New Republic must :
have noticed, the article is a para
phrase, in something intended to be ,
similar to Gertrude Stein's style, of
Peggy Bacon's description of her j
under a caricature which appeared j
in The New Republic several weeks
ago. |
One is merely curious . . . though !
! pleased that the Dippy is aware of I
| The New Republic's existence.

! The Editor, Sir:
The subject of journalistic ethics \
is so vague as to make the present
inquiry much more of a petty tenta- j
tive than an outraged attack. Yet i
there is a question.
Is it the practice of The Daily to !
print paraphrases of articles printed
j elsewhere without the customary j
j acknowledgement?
The reference is, specifically, to '
the feature article on page 1 of <
Wednesday's paper describing Ger- '
trude Stein. As every constant !
reader of The New Republic must :
have noticed, the article is a para
phrase, in something intended to be ,
similar to Gertrude Stein's style, of
Peggy Bacon's description of her j
under a caricature which appeared j
in The New Republic several weeks
ago. |
One is merely curious . . . though !
! pleased that the Dippy is aware of I
| The New Republic's existence.

| The Editor, Sir:
Although Miss Polcar arid I differ
1 greatly in our conception of what I
i constitutes a good photoplay, she |
j tnd I are in mutual accord on this: j
1 our reverence for George Arliss. To i
! me, this performer represents to the |
highest degree the man of intellect, '
i who conquers by persuasion rather I
\ than force, and who yet is able to
| present himself to the crowd in such [
! a way that it can appreciate him and j
vvhat he stands for.
And so it was with misgivings that j
I watched George Arli.-,s desert his ,
colors by playing Wellington. It was ■
]as if Chaplin acted Hamlet. More j
| than a brusque voice is needed to |
! make a soldier, and more than ad- !
jacent trumpets to suggest a leader j
-of men. Arliss, for the first time, j
' seemed artificial, because he van- i
tured into a world in which he did
n't belong.
I feel that '"The Iron Duke" is dull |
! because it does not bring '•a fresh |
' point of view toward the material it
j covers, because its director fails to !
i organically connect the people and I
, the plot and make the whole seem
| significant, and because many of the
J performances are forced and un
! natural, particularly those of the
j Duchess of Richmond and the Duch- j
j ess of Wellington.
j The film is a British production. !
i The British seem to be able to make :
j good films only when they employ i
I Hollywood people, and in this case j
| Mr. Arliss was the sole Hollywood
| importation. At that, he might have !
seen to it that his photographer
I moved his camera about occasion- :
I ally, and that his supporting players
did not obstruct each other on the
sets. Mr. Arliss ought never to have !
appeared with this inefficient com- ;
| pany, particularly when attempting
to play Wellington. The foremost J
film critics here and in England will |
bear me out on this point. Mr. Ar-
I liss hoped to be knighted by virtue i
jof this effort, and it now appears j
J that he not only will not be knighted
| but his producers will lose a fortune j
on the film.
