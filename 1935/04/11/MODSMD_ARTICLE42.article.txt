"THE NUT FARM"
At the California Theater
A boisterous farce that has to do
with a fake movie company, and a
slightly cracked family who invest
in it. The film really is very funny
—not so much when it intends to be
as when it doesn't. Wallace Ford,
who is starred,
manages to
make something
of the role of
family ne'er-do
well, whose in
genuity saves his
clownish rela
tives from bank -
ruptcy. Oscar Apfel, as Wally's
deaf landlord, is genuinely amus
ing, but the rest of the cast horribly
overacts. "The Nut Farm" is a
"quickie," and when it won't do
good business, it doesn't deserve
what it will do.
The second feature, "The Best
Man Wins," is even more objection
able, for it is not only tiresome, but
depressing as well. It tells the old
story of the cop and the crook who
love the same girl. The gunman,
nobly kills himself, and Florence
Rice is left the sole property of Jack
Holt. Edmund Lowe's gangster
characterization is not what it should
be. This probably is not Lowe's
fault, as the story, direction, and
dialogue all bear the mark of hasty
preparation.
—H. G. Lowe
