## RECORDS AT THE SWIM RELAYS 
### 
Jimmy Gilhula, S.C. swimming
captain and headliner Stanford's
uwn swimming relays this Friday
night, is on the short end of another
champion combination, such as the
Ben Eastman-Bill Carr one of sev
eral years ago or the John Lyman-
Jack Torrance pair of a year ago.
(■iihula breaks world's records.
He broke 1(> in an afternoon two
weeks ago in the Trojan pools.
But in the races that really count,
such as the rational competition
o! the past ten days, Gilhula has
the misfortune of swimming
against one Jack Medica, who also
breaks world's records, and with
even more margin than does the
Southern California ace. The re
sult is that Gilhula stiil breaks the
records, but gets no credit for it.
Like Lyman last year, the Card
weight man broke the shot-put
mark by two feet, only to have
Torrance eclipsc it by four a week
later.
Friday night Jack Medica won't
he there, so Gilhula's attempts at the
440-record have a reasonable chance
of being rewarded. To push him,
Stanford's Coach Nort Thornton will
use two of his best distance swim
mers, each swimming a 220. Thorn
ton figures that Gilhula can beat the
combined Stanford team and still be
15 seconds from the xecord!
