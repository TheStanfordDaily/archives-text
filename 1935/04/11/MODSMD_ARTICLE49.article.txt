# WILL SETTLE FOSTER OR TEASDALE QUESTION
## 
### 
Aquatic fans are also anticipating
the dual between Stanford's Captain
Dob Faster and California's .sensa
tional frosh, Walter Tea>dale, in the
fjO-yard breast stroke. Foster held
a Coast record for a few weeks only
to have Teasdale set a new mark at
the California frosh-Stanford frosh
meet.
California barkers are sure that
Stanford's captain will be beaten
by their frosh. But on his eastern
trip Foster picked up a new tech
nique in breast stroke swimming.
It's called the "butterfly" stroke,
just recently legalized by a change
in the rules. It gives greater pow
er and speed, but is so exhausting
that even the champs can use it
only for every other stroke.
Thornton figures that Teasdale
will have to break the record to
beat Foster. Whether the present
mark goes or not local swimming
circles will have one less point of
dissension.
Don't miss it Friday r.ight. The
25-cent admission for students is of?
the price list for the evening, and
student body cards will be suffi
cient. There'll be plenty of action.
