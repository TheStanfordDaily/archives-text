# Dr. Wilbur Will Present Opening Lecture Tonight
## Discussions Will Be Held In Conjunction with New Presidential Chats Talks Are First of Kind To Be Presented Here 
### 
Those who are in any way inter
ested in the problems involved in
the foundation of a great university
such as Stanford, will have the op
portunity of hearing a lecture by
President Ray Lyman Wilbur on the
subject tonight at 7:30 in the Wom
en's Clubhouse.
This is to be the first in what is
hoped will become a triweekly se
ries of lectures and discussions by
Dr. Wilbur in an attempt to bring
the students into closer contact with
the university's president.
Informal Discussion
The topics at each of the subse
quent lectures may be suggested by
interested students. In each case
there will be informal discussions
following the lecture proper which
will also be conducted by Dr. Wil
bur.
Marvie Kahn, A.S.S.U. president,
who sponsored the idea, hopes that
the lectures will become a tradition.
This is the first presentation of its
kind in the history of Stanford.
Kahn and the Ex Committee re
alized that something of this kind
is needed on the campus.
To Foster Spirit
"It is certain," stated Kahn, "that
having the president meet with the
students will foster a closer under
standing and a better spirit.''
Dr. Wilbur in his first lecture will
deal with the foundation of Stanford
in his own inimitable style, mixing a
few well placed jokes wiih the more
serious matters that the founders
faced. After a short talk, the presi
dent will ask a few leading questions
to start the general discussion. All
interested students are invited to
attend and participate in the discus
sion.
The lectures to follow will be held
in various convenient places on the
campus, just where will not be de
cided until later. Ex Committee
members will act as hosts at all
lectures.
