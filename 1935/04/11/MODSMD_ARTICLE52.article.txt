# Golfers Named To Meet Bears In Match Here
## Frosh Victory Over Bear Yearlings Seen 
### 
With the California matches but
two days away Eddie Twiggs
yesterday announced the list of men
to see action against the Bears for
both the freshmen and jhe varsity.
The squad will be led by Tom
Dwyer, who succeeded to the num
ber one ladder position when Law
son Little left for the spring golf
wax's. Dwyer's prowess as a golfer
was more than demonstrated last fall
when he defeated Little, who
was still fresh from his victory in
the National Amateur tournament.
The second position goes to Verne
"Spec" Stewart, medalist in the Na
tional Amateur and present south
west champion. Jack Hoerner, Ne
braska state champion will be in
the third ladder position and Don
Edwards, finalist in the California
Amateur at Pebble Beach last sum
mer and more recently medalist in
the San Francisco Amateur.
Max Stoddard, a newcomer from
last year's frosh, will play the fifth
notch. Bob Thompson, flashy San
Francisco golfer, will play the sixth
position. Bill Hoelle, playing his last
Bear match, and Morse Erskine
round off the list. It is very pos
sible that the line-up will be shifted
before the matches.
The line-up for the fresh jus an
nounced is as follows: Jt.ck Wallace,
number one; Louis Cass, number 2;
Brown Cannon, number 3; Landon
Wheeler, number 4; Pete Hass, num
ber 5; Alan Hyman, number 6; Bill
Wilcox, number 7; Bill Boyd, num
ber 8; Bob Spence, number 9. With
golfers like Louis Cass, Jack Wal
lace, and Brown Cannon they
should have little trouble upholding
a record of four straight victories
over the Bears.
Germany's first road built exclu
sively for cyclists has been opened
between Munich and Starnbcrg, a
distance of 16 miles.
