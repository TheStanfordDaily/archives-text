# Indian Rankings May Be Altered In Net Matches
## Change Considered for S.C. Tennis Tilts Saturday 
### 
'
A strong possibility of a change
!in the varsity tennis rankings
! against U.S.C. Saturday arises as a
j result of Ben Dey's recent victory
! over Eill Seward in a ladder match,
i Seward has been playing third sin-
I gles, one rung above Dey, but posi
| tions mjÂ»y be reversed when the
! Indians and Trojans tangle at 1:30
j o'clock on the varsity courts.
The chance that Di>y fills the
j third spot will be greater if the
1 southerners switch rankings on
i their team, so that Jack Knemeyer
Ino longer plays third singles. Since
| Seward knows Knemeyers game,
j and is probably able to handle the
Trojan better than any ol his team
j mates, he may retain the position.
Lee Plays No. I
i Otherwise the Cards are almost
i certain to take the courts against the
i Trojans in the same order as that
i which they have had all season.
I Captain Sammy Lee will play
| U.S.C.'s Vernon John in the first
| singles, and Stanford's Johnny Law
j should meet Charles Carr again in
jlhe second match. Lee is a heavy
favorite to repeat his straight-set
triumph of last month, but the match
between Law and Carr may well be
| the closest of the afternoon,
j Indian Jack Lynch and Trojan
; Boyd Gsorgi are to clash in the fifth
I singles, and Stanford's Bob Pominer
1 will tangle with Bob Rowley of
j U.S.C. in the sixth. Doubles matches
will probably be as follows: Lee-
IPommer (S) vs. John-Carr (U.S.C.);
| Seward-Dey (S.) vs. Knemeyer
iWooledge (U.S.C.); Law-Lynch
' (S.) vs. Georgi-Rowley (U.S.C.)
Change Match Dates
j The Stanford-California varsity
net matches, originally scheduled
for Big Meet day, are to be played
at 1:30 o'clock Thursday afternoon,
April 18, on the Berkeley courts.
| Next Tuesday at 1:30 o'clock the
I junior varsity, instead of the regu
! lars, will meet the Pomona Tennis
