# POOR HITTING BY INDIANS AIDS U.C.L.A. IN 4-1 WIN
## 
### BOB LELAND 
There is an old, old adage in base
ball to the effect that if you can't
hit you can't win games. Stanford
couldn't hit in the pinches yester
day, so the U.C.L.A. Bruins won a
ball game 4-1.
On no less than seven occasions
the Indians had men on the paths,
but in each case the old punch was
lacking. In the fourth Brent walked,
Mallatratt was safe on an error and
"Bones" Hamilton beat out a bunt.
Turner then forced Brent at the
1 plate, and Mallatratt wandered in
] with the lone ran as Tremaine was
forcing Turner at second.
Runners Fail to Score
In the fifth Ferro was safe on an
error and Co-captain Heringer
doubled to right, Ferro going to
third. Leidig, Brent, and Mallatratt
were unable to score Ferro. The
ninth again found the Indians with
i a pair of runners on the bases, but
Heringer flied out to end the contest.
Again it was a one-big-inning af
fair for the opposition. Johnny
I Campbell, who started, got into hot
; water in the second. He walked the
1 first batter and plunked the second
!in the ribs. Clark made a fine stop
; of McClintock's smash but threw the
: ball away, one run coming over,
j- An infield out sent another across,
i and then the ball player's natural
enemy, the umpire, handed the
1 Uclans a run. Mallatratt took a
: grounder an dtossed to Ferro, but
dust must have gotten into the
j "ump's" eyes for he called the run
' ner safe.
Final Score in Sixth
The Bruins gained their last mark
, or in the six'.h on a hit batter, an
iClub on the Farm courts. .
Stanford's frosh netsters and Ber
keley High School will clash in a
home match for the Papooses at 9:30
o'clock Saturday morning. The am

schedule with two matches next
week, meeting Modesto Junior Col

error and Co-captain Heringer
doubled to right, Ferro going to
third. Leidig, Brent, and Mallatratt
were unable to score Ferro. The

Heringer flied out to end the contest.
Again it was a one-big-inning af
fair for the opposition. Johnny
I Campbell, who started, got into hot
; water in the second. He walked the
1 first batter and plunked the second
!in the ribs. Clark made a fine stop

: ball away, one run coming over,
j- An infield out sent another across,
i and then the ball player's natural
enemy, the umpire, handed the
1 Uclans a run. Mallatratt took a

dust must have gotten into the
j "ump's" eyes for he called the run
' ner safe.

There is an old, old adage in base
ball to the effect that if you can't
hit you can't win games. Stanford
couldn't hit in the pinches yester
day, so the U.C.L.A. Bruins won a
ball game 4-1.
On no less than seven occasions
the Indians had men on the paths,
but in each case the old punch was
lacking. In the fourth Brent walked,
Mallatratt was safe on an error and
"Bones" Hamilton beat out a bunt.
Turner then forced Brent at the
