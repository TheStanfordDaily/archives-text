# 'Beat Bears' Frosh Told In Coach's Talk
## Ellington Sets 70-Point Aim For Track Squad 
### Gordy Frost 
"We should score 70 points
against Cal!"
This is the way optimistic Coach
Bill Ellington has lined up the
chances for his frosh track team to
swamp California frosh a week
from Friday in their annual "little
big meet' 'and Ellington told his men
this in no uncertain terms at the
yearling track meeting yesterday
afternoon.
Bears Have 92 Out
"California has 92 men out for
frosh track; we have 15. That means
that you fellows will have to double
up, even triple up to win." Ellington
gave hi.s men the dope on the Cal
meet outcome in this manner:
Stanford should take the discus
with Otto Beringer heaving in the
vicinity of 147 feet and Glenn Ham
ilton and Stan Marks doing near
J4O. California's best effort is 137
feet. With the discus should come
the javdin. Grant Stone has thrown
the "stick" 178 feet; Cal's best is 176.
Concedes Shot, I'ole
Ellington concedes the shot-put
and the pole vault to the Bear Cubs
but claims that Cy Oberg can win
the hurdles since his time is better
than those of California by .4 of a
second.
"They have nothing in the broad
jump so we can count on points
there," went on Bill. Further he says
that Hank Luisetti will take the high
jump, Jim Kneubuhl the sprints and
Edson Burrows the 880.
As far as mile and two mile are
concerned Bill is still optimistic but
not sure of victory.
