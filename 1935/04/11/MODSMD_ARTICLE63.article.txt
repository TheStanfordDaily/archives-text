bert Hoover, titular head of Ihe Re- i
publican party, was reported au- j
thoritatively tonight to be planning j
to wield actively—but from a posi- j
! tion in the background—the weight !
lof that title in shaping the G.O.P.
! for the 1936 campaign.
; As the former president planned j

however, among the more than two- j
score political leaders and acquaint- I
ances who conferred with him.
