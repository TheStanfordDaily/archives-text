"Letter" men, as well as oilier
leaders in undergraduate life,
are individuals with lots of vi
tality. Their energy and their
enthusiasm make them popular.
Put many others fail to take
proper care of their health.
Their drive and pep is often
slowed down by constipation
due to insufficient "bulk."
Fortunately, this can be cor
rected. Kellogg's All-Bran, a
delicious cereal, supplies "bulk"
as well as vitamin B and iron.
This "bulk" is mild in action.
Two tablespoonfuls daily,
served with milk or cream, are
usually sufficient to promote
regular habits. Ask that it be
served at your fraternity
house, eating-club or campus
restaurant.
