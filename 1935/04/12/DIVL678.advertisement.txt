adds to thi' fun
The refreshing coolness and light weight of Palm
Beach suits add to the fun of the fun for which you
are wearing them...
...to say nothing of the kick you get out of knowing
that, in spite of your comfort, you look smart and tailored.
Few folks know what a variety of Palm Beach models
there are: open shoulder coats with room for a 250
yard swing, shirred and belted backs. Trousers full cut.
In checks, plaids, herringbones and white. All tailored
smartly by Goodall. A splendid showing atyour clothier's.
