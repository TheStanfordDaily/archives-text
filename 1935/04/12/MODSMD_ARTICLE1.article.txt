## University Architects Will Start Working On Details Now NAMED MEMORIAL HALL Bronze Plaques in Foyer To Honor Professors 
### Boh Adams 
The new theater project received
the official sanction of the Board of
Trustees at their regular meeting in
San Francisco yesterday afternoon.
The trustees passed on three meas
ures: the 'ir.st to name the new build
ing the Memorial Hall, inasmuch as
the construction will house more
than just a theater; secondly, they
approved the architects' plans for the
building, and finally they authorized
the ali-important financial arrange
ments.
University architects, Bakevvell
*n(! Brown, will start immediately
the drawing of detailed plans for
the building. This task will take
about five months. The building
will be of the finest earthquake
proof, fireproof, steel construction.
It is possible that Actual work on
the structure will start in Septem
ber with completion scheduled for
a year after that date.
The new buiiding is to be located
on the plot of ground near the ruins
of the old library. The theater itself
will accommodate 1522 persons, but
arrangements wiil be included so
that auditoriums of 810 or 712 per
sons can be easily arranged for
smaller groups. There will also be
a little theater of 184 seats.
Bronze plaques in honor of various
Stanford professors v/ill constitute
the memorial features of the lu.il in
the attractive ioyer. Included in (he
building will be ample accommoda
tions for the work ol dramatic groups
such as workshop stage, dressing
and make-up rooms, and property
rooms.
I lie financial arrangements as
approved by the trustees provide
for the use of student funds as a
partial aid in paying for the costs
of construction. Profits from vari
ous student body organizations
have been diverted into a theater
fund.
The trustees' action today marks
the end of a long campaign by vari
ous campus groups for some kind of
an auditorium to replace the present
assembly hall and provide a more
suitable place for dramatic and mu
sical eflorts. The plans accepted
combine the finest features of five
previous sets of plans that have been
submitted and carry the approval of
students and faculty as well as the
Board of Trustees.
