# A 						NATION-WIDE COLLEGE STRIKE FOR PEACE
## 
### 
(Editorial)
This morning at 11 o'clock classes in t'nivcrsitics all over
the country will walk out in sympathy with the nation-wide
student strike against war.
The propaganda sheets issued hv organizations hacking
the demonstration announce: "We must not let the drums
of war and glorious, meaningless slogans fool us again. On
this eighteenth anniversary of the World War, on the eve
of a more terrible world war, let lis join hands with students
throughout the world in the international strike and dem
onstration against war and against fascism."
Stirring words, sincerely written. Hut what actual t/ood
will words accomplish? College youth willingly cuts its
classes for one hour. It would do the same for a May Day
celebration.
While American students pause today, the nations of
Kuropc continue with their active war preparations. A
student strike in this country has no meaning to them. Nor
does it have any meaning lo those who sit in government
circles and determine policies in regard to naval parity and
armaments.
In a special dispatch to the Daily in column three of
this page are statements by members of the special Senate
committee investigating the armaments industry. They
supposedly join in support of the strike movement. Per
haps direct action in reducing the production of industries
engaged in manufacturing armaments for war might be
more effective than their "approval" of the pacifist demon
stration.
What should be realized is that cutting classes lias no
inherent connection with opposing war. In the eyes of the
world, students will not be respected more for this futile
demonstration against war. It is honest resistance of the
individual in his l/tin/ciifij, that will lead to an avoidance
of the hysteria which surrounds warfare.
Here on the campus, Stanford gives its students who
wish to express their ideas on war ample opportunity lo
do so in the asembly hall this morning. Intelligent discus
sion and objective thought substitute for an ill-timed mass
demonstration thai cannot possibly accomplish anything.
The precedent set ;it Stanford today is a valuable one.
Other colleges would do well to follow in the footsteps of
sane and intelligent objection as opposed to a nation-wide
"strike."
