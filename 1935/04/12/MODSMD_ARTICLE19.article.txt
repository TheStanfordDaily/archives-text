# Dust Disaster Raises Prices of Winter Wheat
## 
### 
CHICAGO, April 11 (/!'). â€”- The
disaster of springtime dust storms
was converted into cash terms lod;ty
as wheat prices bounded upward.
Spurred by a sensationally low
government estimate of the pros
pective winter wheat crop, traders
bid wheat futures contracts up 1o
new levels. Gains of nearly four
cents a bushel were recorded .shortly
after ihe market opened, and so
spirited was the trading that prices
on the blackboard lagged behind
those in the pit.
