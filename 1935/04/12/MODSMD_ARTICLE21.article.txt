# Peeping Toms Prophesy War in Royal Elections
## List of Entries Grows For Masque Ball Contest 
### Irvin Jorgenson 
Confidential observers in their best
confidential manner revealed today
i that the big war in 1935 will not be
fought in the Balkans, but between
the Row, the Halls, and the Fire
house for the supremacy of the
Masque Ball King and Queen Con
test.
Barnette "Leviticus" Greenlee, as
pirant to the kingly honor, is being
backed, tooth and nail, hook and lad
der, by the fire laddies, who are
pawning their red flannels and com
munity-plate cuspidors to provide
money for the kingly contestant.
Greenlee Mute
Interviewed yesterday, Greenlee
answered the questions of your very
own Daily correspondent with ani
mal cunning. Said the reporter: "Are
you running for Masque Ball king?"
"Haw!" answered Leviticus.
"Who is backing you?" the report
er asked.
"Haw!" responded the sage, un
doubtedly referring to the firehouse.
Having learned all this necessary
information, your very own corre
| spondent departed for other haunts.
He found the battle lines closely
drawn. Other devilment is now re
volving about the Hall candidates
who are going down into the sock
for the historic contest.
