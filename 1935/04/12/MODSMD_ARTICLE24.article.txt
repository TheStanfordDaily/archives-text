# Farm History Revealed by Pres. Wilbur
## First of Talks Is Given By University Head 
### 
Under the guiding influence of Dr.
Ray Lyman Wilbur th<> problems of
the foundation of Stanford Univer
sity were unfolded before an ap
preciative audience last night in the
Women's Clubhouse.
When Senator and Mrs. Stanford
sought advice from Dr. Elliot of
Harvard, that eminent educator, be
lieving the scheme to be impractical,
placed a cost of $5,000,000 on the
project, supposing such a high price
would scare the Stanfords out.
"Well, June," replied Senator
Stanford, "I think we can afford it."
In such a manner was Leland Stan
ford Junior University born.
Early Campus Wit
Strong opposition to the founda
tion of another university in the
bay region was presented by the
University of California regents, who
believed that there was no need for
another four-year institution so
close to the state university.
Some example of early campus wit
were related by President Wilbur
dealing with "rumors in Encina." On
this subject the first issue of Chap
arral carried a cartoon of a "rough"
in a bathtub with the caption, "A
roomer afloat in Encina."
Fresh Wore Beards
Those were the days of the real
Stanford rough before the days of
increased female population. Many
of the students wore older than their
professors, and fro.sh wore beards.
The buildings on the Quad are
constructed in such a manner that
the walls may be moved, thus allow
ing for considerable alteration with
little difficulty. All of these build
ings have been revamped five or six
times in the past.
It was the intention of the Stan
fords to build a great chateau on
the present site of the Mausoleum.
That is why the site is the center of
the road scheme in the vicinity of
Palm Drive.
Mosaics Destroyed
There is an interesting bit of his
tory attached to the mosaics that
face the Memorial Chapel. The first
set was destroyed by the earthquake.
The second was destroyed when an
Austrian bombing plane blew up the
factory in which they were being
made.
The third set met an equally un
usual fate when the ship upon which
it was being shipped to the United
States wao tropedoed in the Mediter
ranean by a German submarine. The
fourth and last set to be made now
adorns the Chapel's front wall. All
the .sets were produced in Venice.

Stanford rough before the days of
increased female population. Many
of the students wore older than their
professors, and fro.sh wore beards.
The buildings on the Quad are
constructed in such a manner that
the walls may be moved, thus allow
ing for considerable alteration with
little difficulty. All of these build
ings have been revamped five or six
times in the past.
It was the intention of the Stan
fords to build a great chateau on
the present site of the Mausoleum.
That is why the site is the center of
the road scheme in the vicinity of
Palm Drive.
Mosaics Destroyed
There is an interesting bit of his
tory attached to the mosaics that
face the Memorial Chapel. The first
set was destroyed by the earthquake.
The second was destroyed when an
Austrian bombing plane blew up the
factory in which they were being
made.
The third set met an equally un
usual fate when the ship upon which
it was being shipped to the United
States wao tropedoed in the Mediter
ranean by a German submarine. The
fourth and last set to be made now
adorns the Chapel's front wall. All
the .sets were produced in Venice.
Under the guiding influence of Dr.
Ray Lyman Wilbur th<> problems of
the foundation of Stanford Univer
sity were unfolded before an ap
preciative audience last night in the
Women's Clubhouse.
When Senator and Mrs. Stanford
sought advice from Dr. Elliot of
Harvard, that eminent educator, be
lieving the scheme to be impractical,
placed a cost of $5,000,000 on the
project, supposing such a high price
would scare the Stanfords out.
"Well, June," replied Senator
Stanford, "I think we can afford it."
In such a manner was Leland Stan
ford Junior University born.
Early Campus Wit
Strong opposition to the founda
tion of another university in the
bay region was presented by the
University of California regents, who
believed that there was no need for
another four-year institution so
close to the state university.
Some example of early campus wit
were related by President Wilbur
dealing with "rumors in Encina." On
this subject the first issue of Chap
arral carried a cartoon of a "rough"
in a bathtub with the caption, "A
roomer afloat in Encina."
Fresh Wore Beards
Those were the days of the real
Stanford rough before the days of
increased female population. Many
of the students wore older than their
professors, and fro.sh wore beards.
