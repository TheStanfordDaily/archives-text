# Campus Dance Publicity Goes Hey-Hey
## 
### 
Stanford's energetic (lice Club has extended
itself and is coining out tonight with the big
gest circus the campus has ever seen. It's
being called the Firemen's Ball, lint in addition
lo the "haunting tunes" of a campus hand
lor dancing, the did) is including for the sum
of one "silva dolla" the incomparable enter
tainment of its own singing members, Philbert
the singing fireman, Coddington the magician,
lire works, and innumerable great features
which can only be adequately described by the
"dolla" seeking, Barnum-minded chairman.
High - pressure publicity, tricky theatrical
schemes have all been forced down the throats
of the campus in an elTort lo sell bids for the
great Firemen's Ball. Witness the Coddington
creation in the Campus ()pinion column today,
written by a committee member about one of
his fellow entertainers. It is, lo say the least,
reminiscent of grade school days.
Perhaps it is a great honor for the Stanford
I'ire Department to be honored by the Stan
ford (dee Club, but why should il be exploited
into sending its engines screaming around the
Quad, up the How, and around the Halls with
a bunch of singing clubmen advertising that
they are to have a circus given in the name of
the lire department to raise funds for them
selves.
As an excuse for sneers, threats, and plead
ings lo give the circus news space and top
stories, the committee says that other campus
dances Ibis year have gone into the hole be
cause there has not been enough publicity.
This is not true. Other causes have created
tnis unfortunate situation. Nevertheless the
Dmi.y feels that if Stanford has to go Holly
wood to pul on a financially successful all'air,
the dances are not worth while.
