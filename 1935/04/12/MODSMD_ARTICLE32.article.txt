# Supervisors and the San Francisco Fair
## 
### 
Sun Francisco voters will have a hoi potato
tossed at I hem May second, when they will he
called on to decide a question that should have
been settled months a 540 the 19118 exposition.
This is the situation :is it emerges from a
linai court appeal to stop the Hoard of Super
visors from ducking their responsibility; and
it will result in needless expense to the tax
payers. not to speak of the posihilily that a
fair may not be held.
Whether the fair should be held on Verba
liuena Shoals or "on the mainland within the
live-cent street car fare," and whether voters
would agree to a bond issue for a mainland
fair are the questions to be decided next
month.
The hopeless tangles which might arise are
illustrated by the possibility that voters may
ask for a mainland site, yet refuse to ask for
a bond issue, thus throwing finances into a
San Francisco deserves an exposition. There
never was any valid argument against the
Verba Buena site, nor any reason for tossing
the issue into the laps of the voters. Hut two
supervisors, who are supposed to act for the
public good, have blocked this praiseworthy
movement, perhaps forever.
Hacked by little cliques of "boosters" from
nearly every vacant lot in the bay area, this
little duo has shown its sclf-sullieiency by
proving a complete rock in the road of prog
ress.
