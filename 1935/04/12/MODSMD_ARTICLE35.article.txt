## PLANNED BEASE—HULME 
### john McClelland 
"Do you think there is less possibility of war now
than in 1914?" Russia's dictator Stalin asked England's
peace ambassador Anthony Eden last week. "Yes,"
was the answer. "I don't," replied Stalin, "because
(here are two nations who want to fight now whereas
there was only one 21 years ago."
When such men as these so openly discuss the pos
sibility of war the urgent necessity to take steps to
prevent fighting can be denied by no one. Colleges
don't deny it. Today is peace day in universities all
over the country. And today is peace day at Stanford.
This afternoon groups will gather to discuss such
things as "Why nations fight," "Does international or
ganization prevent war,'' "Proposed solutions for keep
i ing out of war," and "The strategy of non-violence."
These discussions are worthy moves in promoting
peace, Professor Edward M. Hulme believes, but the
basis for lasting peace lies deeper than any concrete
moves that could be taken at any one time.
"Peace will come," Professor Hulmc says, "with
the betterment of all civilisation to the point where
international understanding will prevent peoples
i* from letting their governments lead them into
war." The abolition of ignorance, poverty, and
! communicable diseases and the establishment of
peace through planned measures will put civiliza
tion on as high a plane as any man can dream of;
and fantastic though such aspirations may seem,
they are not impossible."
Professor Hulme is an ardent pacifist. And he has
nothing but contempt for alarmists whom he holds as
largely responsible for the almost universal policy of
| heavy armaments.
"In most countries," he says, "the larger percent
: age of the nation's income goes for pensions, war debts,
and army and navy maintenance. If the percentage
were reversed—if the small share were spent on the
j results and preparation for war, and the larger share
on internal improvement, education, scientific ad«-
' vancement and promotion of international understand
ing and good will, then the nations of the world would
be on the way toward permanent peace.
"But now —why I am a professor of medieval his
tory, and there are certain characteristics of the civili
zation of the dark ages which still exist."
Ignorance, Professor Hulmc would sec wiped
out by putting education within the means and
opportunity of all; by putting men in the place of
women in American secondary schools. Poverty
lie sees fading out with the reduction of revenue
spent 011 waT preparation. Communicable diseases
he believes can he wiped out by intense medical
and scientific elVort and by the sterilization of the
diseased and mentally unfit.
As for peace: "I don't think the people of any
country ever really want to go to war. Vested interests,
ambitious leaders are the ones who Cause the gi'eat
conflicts. If propaganda were turned toward peace
instead of war, and the people had to be consulted
before a war is begun. I don't believe there would be
any fighting."

than in 1914?" Russia's dictator Stalin asked England's
peace ambassador Anthony Eden last week. "Yes,"
was the answer. "I don't," replied Stalin, "because
(here are two nations who want to fight now whereas
there was only one 21 years ago."
When such men as these so openly discuss the pos
sibility of war the urgent necessity to take steps to
prevent fighting can be denied by no one. Colleges
don't deny it. Today is peace day in universities all
over the country. And today is peace day at Stanford.
This afternoon groups will gather to discuss such
things as "Why nations fight," "Does international or
ganization prevent war,'' "Proposed solutions for keep
i ing out of war," and "The strategy of non-violence."
These discussions are worthy moves in promoting
peace, Professor Edward M. Hulme believes, but the
basis for lasting peace lies deeper than any concrete
moves that could be taken at any one time.
"Peace will come," Professor Hulmc says, "with
the betterment of all civilisation to the point where
international understanding will prevent peoples
i* from letting their governments lead them into
war." The abolition of ignorance, poverty, and
! communicable diseases and the establishment of
peace through planned measures will put civiliza
tion on as high a plane as any man can dream of;
and fantastic though such aspirations may seem,
they are not impossible."
Professor Hulme is an ardent pacifist. And he has
nothing but contempt for alarmists whom he holds as
largely responsible for the almost universal policy of
| heavy armaments.
"In most countries," he says, "the larger percent
: age of the nation's income goes for pensions, war debts,
and army and navy maintenance. If the percentage
were reversed—if the small share were spent on the
j results and preparation for war, and the larger share
on internal improvement, education, scientific ad«-
' vancement and promotion of international understand
ing and good will, then the nations of the world would
be on the way toward permanent peace.
"But now —why I am a professor of medieval his
tory, and there are certain characteristics of the civili
zation of the dark ages which still exist."
Ignorance, Professor Hulmc would sec wiped
out by putting education within the means and
opportunity of all; by putting men in the place of
women in American secondary schools. Poverty
lie sees fading out with the reduction of revenue
spent 011 waT preparation. Communicable diseases
he believes can he wiped out by intense medical
and scientific elVort and by the sterilization of the
diseased and mentally unfit.
As for peace: "I don't think the people of any
country ever really want to go to war. Vested interests,
ambitious leaders are the ones who Cause the gi'eat
conflicts. If propaganda were turned toward peace
instead of war, and the people had to be consulted
before a war is begun. I don't believe there would be
any fighting."
"Do you think there is less possibility of war now
than in 1914?" Russia's dictator Stalin asked England's
peace ambassador Anthony Eden last week. "Yes,"
was the answer. "I don't," replied Stalin, "because
(here are two nations who want to fight now whereas
there was only one 21 years ago."
