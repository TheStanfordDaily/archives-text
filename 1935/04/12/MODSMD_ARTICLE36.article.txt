# OUR HASHER SEZ:
## 
### 
Today is April 12—Cheerio, folks! Open up your
windows, throw out your chests, breathe deeply, and
say to yourself, "Today is a wonderful day! Today is a
wonderful day!" Smile at everyone you meet. And
«ome frightened girl on the Quad, unaccustomed to
such rough treatment, will probably come up to you
and slap your face.
It is our firm conviction that the "hello" tradition
at Stanford is saved only for Rally Committee men
running for office, and for Rally Committee men not
running for office.
Which reminds us that today is April 12
War is a blot on our civilization. Open up your
windows, folks, throw out your chests, breathe deeply,
and .say to yourself, "War is a blot on our civilization,"
and smile at everyone you meet.
We have a very special message from our Sequoia
minion, the languorous, sloe-eyed "C.8.":
...Sequoia Hall, Rangoon Pagoda, Looking Eastward
to the Sea, April 11 (IHS). —Shunning Communism,
the kitchen force here today voted for the Going-to-
Townsend plan.
The hashers are going to drastically change their
plan over the original one to make it mors acceptable
to everyone.
The plan is to engage the Cook in a fan-tan game,
the proceeds to go to charity.
The charity will consist of $200 a month to every
hasher over six. When asked "For how long?" hench
man Dazey replied: "That is entirely up to the cook.
We hope to catch him with his pans down."
Our esteemed contemporaries and pursuers of the
bounded calf, the gentlemen who "set-'em-up" for
Stanford intellectual lights and dim bulbs at <he Re
serve Book Room, are pointing with alarm to the de
cline of smart remarks in examinations which can be
copied in humor magazines at so much a word.
They say there used to be a professor in the history
department, Adams by name, who would give full
credit for answers in examination papers if they
showed ingenuity even though deficient in factual
knowledge.
One particular question sought the time that it took
for a steamer to go from Albany to New York. The
answer came in. "I don't know, my ship sunk outside
of Albany." Or something similar. Anyway. I bet it
was pretty funny at the time.
Which reminds us that i1 is April 12, and time to
..top this blot on civilization.
