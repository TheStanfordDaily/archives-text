# BULL SESSION
## PEACE OVER STANFORD 
### 
This is the day-of-peace. From
the rock-ribbed shores of Maine to
the sandstone arches of Stanford,
students today will urge peace upon
the world. Not that the world wants
peace urged upon it. Quite the con
trary. Which is all the more rea
son fcr the students' activity.
At a dozen universities the cru
sade for peace has already turned
into the battle of the century. With
i expulsions bursting in air and ar
j rests ricocheting over neighboring
I campi, one must be thankful that on
• the Farm the day-of-peace will be
j celebrated in peaceable fashion.
The opposition to peace demon
strations that has developed at nu
merous universities makes it quite
apparent that many people are ac
tively for peace, until they are
asked to do something about it. The
moment "peace" leaves the realm of
| very hazy idealism, "peace" is bound
| to have far more enemies than
| friends.
J i—
The junior college president who
expelled a co-ed for encouraging a
.-student peace strike, the
! ites who encouraged the arrest of
J students passing out anti-war hand-
I bills, are typical of those who talk

peace, and think war. More than
once "the young men and women of
i America" have been urged to make
impossible another such "holocaust
as enveloped the world in 1914."
! More than once "the younger gen
j oration" has been told that it is its
j duty "to build a better world." But
i the moment the "young people" at
; tempt to make reality of the fine
j sounding platitudes of their elders,
they are promptly kicked in the lace.
i
| As important as is the fight for
j peace, of more immediate importance
jis the fight for academic freedom.
I Without the right of self-expression,
the struggle for peace or for any
other liberal objective is doomed to
'failure. Stanford students — fortu
j nate in the enjoyment of far more
; freedom than exists at most other
! universities — must not consider
I themselves "above" co-operating
| with the students of other institu
-1 tiens. The students of Stanford
University alone will never bring
peace to the world —assuming that
they want peace. It will only be by
unified action that such a goal can
ever be reached.
Today the doves of peace float over
Stanford. Let us hope that the dovev
are not barren.
