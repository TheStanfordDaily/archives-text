I The Editor, Sir:
The general smug complacency
| toward Stanford's celebration of an
| anti-war demonstration has been
highly amusing. We have been out-
I doing ourselves in .stressing "the in
: telligent way" in which the whole
[ affair is being handled. We forget
I that the radical advocacy of a strike
i rests upon just as rational grounds
• as the liberal's insistence to talk the
j whole thing over. The radical knows
j that the war system is wrong and
1 maintains that it is inherent in the
capitalistic system; consequently he
1 feels that it is inevitable. He is act
| ing from a definite, well thought out
j philosophy. .
I What good docs talking do in time
jof war? What chance is there to
I talk? The only effective opposition
i is in concerted action, and .such mass
demonstration is found in a strike,
j A strike then is a mobilization to
! resist war.
