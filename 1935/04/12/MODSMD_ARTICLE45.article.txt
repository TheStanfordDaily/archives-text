"GOLD DIGGERS OF 1935"
At the Stanford Theater
Maybe you like Dick Powell. And
maybe you even still like musical
slap-sticks. But even at that, you
will probably hiss at "Gold Dig
gers"— most ot the audience did.
Gloria Stuart provides a decora
tive feminine lead who does noth-

in g extremely
gracefully. She
• changes from a
demure daugh
ter of the rich to
a not-so-demure
daughter of the
rich, but other
wise is given lit-

tle opportunity. Alice Brady, her
mother, is forced to over-act
throughout the picture.
Hugh Herbert is funny, at times,
but in a way more calculated to
please ten-year-olds than college
students.
The plot is simple — pathetically
j simple. Dick Powell is hired to show
, Gloria Stuart a good time before
she marries a 42-year-old million
aire snuff-box collector. They, of
course, fall in love, but not until
her ex-fiance has been charged with
breach of promise, her brother mar
ried to his fifth chorus girl, and they
have all appeared in a musical show.
The story is passable, but the mu
sical show is impossible. A close
up of Powell and Stuart beneath
apple blossoms shifts to a long shot,

and then shows the couple reduced
in size to two inches on top of a
piano. A trio then sings touchingly,
and two thousand pianos swing into
view. The pianos then dance.
This touching little musical num
ber, which would be distinctly lim
mited by a stage less than three
blocks square, shifts to New York.
A buxum brunette falls screaming
and whirling from a skyscraper, and
fades gradually into a whirling rou
lette wheel. Oh well—why go on?
Send your small brother and go 10
another show. —Whit more
