# Losses From Dust Storms Grow Higher
## Southwest Wheat Suffers Greatest Damage 
### 
Out of choking clouds which still |
hung like a pestilence over thousands j
of square miles in the Southwest— j
brewing spot of big dust storms—re
ports emerged yesterday of rapidly |
mounting losses in wheat, "the mon- |
ey crop."
Piece by piece the gloomy picture
came from Southeastern Colorado, j
Southwestern Kansas, Northwestern
Oklahoma, and the Texas Panhandle. [
It was tempered in part by reports
elsewhere. The big wheat acres of
Northwestern and North Central 1
Kansas maintained a favorable out- !
look. Rain and snow raised hopes in j
the northwestern tier of states.
At Washington the AAA rushed
plans for full benefit payments to ]
drought-harassed farmers who plant:
no wheat. In the grain markets
wheat rose nearly 4 cents a bushel.
Walter Barlow, Amariiio grain ele- '
vator operator, estimated the wheat
crop damage in the Texas Panhandle |
at $18,000,000 to $20,000,000.
Harry B. Cordell, president of the
Oklahoma Board of Agriculture, de- i
elared most of Oklahoma's "best '
wheat" is ruined.
In Eastern New Mexico farmers |
were leaving Union county. One es- ;
timate of those involved in the exo- j
dus was 8 per cent.
