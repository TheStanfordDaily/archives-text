# BRITISH, FRENCH VIE AT STRESA
## Anglo-Italia Aid Sought To Limit German Arms 
### 
STRESA, April 1] (VP).—A clash
of opinion between British and
French delegations developed at to
day's inaugural sessions of the tri
power conference here, authoritative
quarters said tonight, filer France
moved to get British and Italian sup
port for her appeal to Geneva against
German rearmament.
The French, it was learned, tossed
into the midst of the afternoon ses
sion their memorandum of Adolf
Hitler's alleged repudiation of treat
ies.
Pushed into the background by
the French move were other broader
issues of security, even though Prime
Minister Ramsay Mac Donald of
Britain at the morning session had
outlined his nation's desire for an
inclusive system to safeguard the
Continent's peace.
Despite a decided swing in Italian
opinion away from irritation at Brit
ain's "negative policy," Paris dele
gates openly scouted the suggestion,
traced to Mussolini, that Hitler
might be invited to the conference.
"Neither to this nor any subsequent
conference" was the gist of iheir
opinion.
Contents of ihc French memoran
dum, which supports tho Paris ap
peal against Germany's violation of
the Versailles treaty, will not be lis
eloscd until it is introduced at the
extraordinary session of the League
of Nations Council opening next
Monday.
Officials here indicated it would be
accompanied by draft of a resolu
tion condemning treaty violation,
which France will seek to have the
League Council adopt.
"Three wise men of the West"—
Mac Donald, Mussoliyi, and Premier
Flandin of France—reached no de
cision during their five and one
half-hour conference today as to
method of handling the French pro
test. The problem will be tackled
again tomorrow.
