# 24 Stanford Trackmen Entrain Tonight for Bruin Meet
## Cards in Last Test Before Bear Meet; Lack Full Strength Weakness in Sprints, Broad Jump Felt Although Cards Favored 
### 
Stanford's varsity track team,
minus a broad jumper and three
sprinters, leaves tonight for Los An
geles, where tomorrow they encoun
ter U.C.LA. in the Coliseum.
Condition, the old taskmaster, will
be the Cards' chief opponent. Rain
has caused them to mark time for
the last several weeks, while the
southland sun has shone upon the
Bruins, a team fortified with less
skill, but more luck than our boys.
Condition notwithstanding, a mod
erate but fairly accurate dope sheet
has the Cards winning by eight
points. But they have to win both
hurdles, 440, mile, and relay, and a

generous helping of seconds and
thirds. U.C.L.A. is given an edge in
the sprints, 880, two-mile, broad
jump, and pole vault.
Blackman vs. LuValle
To win the quarter Captain AI
Blackman will have to stay ahead of
Jimmy LuValle. And if the sepia
Bruin captain is in his old form it
will be quite a job. LuValle ran 46.9
in the East two years ago and beat
Blackman last year, but has been
out of shape so far this spring.
Chuck Voigt is the only surviv
ing Stanford sprinter, and a lame
muscle has kept him above 10 flat
since the first of March. He will
have to face Bruin MacLennan Sat
urday. Kay Dean, Voigt's running
mate, will not be able to make the
trip, so Monk Moscrip goes in his
place.
Coach Templeton's chief gripe is
the lack of a broad jumper on the
campus. George Tharp, the best
man, almost kills himself each time
he jumps, his heel still being the
source of pain. Voigt and Dean can't
jump at the present, so Dink had AI
Hershey and Monk Moscrip as pos
sible surprise entrants yesterday.
Klopstock F-U'ored
Sammy Klopstock, who has to go
through an unbeaten season if the
Cards are going anywhere, will meet
Carl Dwire of the Uclans in both
hurdles. Dwire is no laggart over
ihe sticks, but Sam has come through
so often that all the odds are on him.
How will the distances come out?
There's no telling for none of the
Cards runners have had a fair chance
to run in the sun for the last month.
Rusty March hasn't run 1:57 for
quite a while in the 880. and Mur
phy of the Uclans does it all the
time. Dave Devlin, Card best bet in
the two-mile, will face Henry
Sticher, who beat him last year and
looked good against California.
Templeton has a fine pair of mil
ers in Warren Dixon and Chuck
Nimmo, but under the conditions
prevailing they are no cinch to beat
Beverly Keim, the Bruin veteran
who has turned in fast times re
cently.
Four field events, the shot, dis
cus, javelin, and high jump, the old
standbys, should furnish about 30
points to the Card total, a very wel
come amount. Jim Reynolds in the
.shot, Jack King and Phil Levy in the
discus, Johnny Mottram and Dud
Sales in the javelin, and Humbert
Smith, Lloyd Schween, and Ken
Nobs in the high jump all have the
edge over their Wcstwood opponents.
The pole vault is all Uclan's.

will be quite a job. LuValle ran 46.9
in the East two years ago and beat
Blackman last year, but has been
out of shape so far this spring.
Chuck Voigt is the only surviv
ing Stanford sprinter, and a lame
muscle has kept him above 10 flat
since the first of March. He will
have to face Bruin MacLennan Sat
urday. Kay Dean, Voigt's running
mate, will not be able to make the
trip, so Monk Moscrip goes in his
place.
Coach Templeton's chief gripe is
the lack of a broad jumper on the
campus. George Tharp, the best
man, almost kills himself each time
he jumps, his heel still being the
source of pain. Voigt and Dean can't
jump at the present, so Dink had AI
Hershey and Monk Moscrip as pos
sible surprise entrants yesterday.
Klopstock F-U'ored
Sammy Klopstock, who has to go
through an unbeaten season if the
Cards are going anywhere, will meet
Carl Dwire of the Uclans in both
hurdles. Dwire is no laggart over
ihe sticks, but Sam has come through
so often that all the odds are on him.
How will the distances come out?
There's no telling for none of the
Cards runners have had a fair chance
to run in the sun for the last month.
Rusty March hasn't run 1:57 for
quite a while in the 880. and Mur
phy of the Uclans does it all the
time. Dave Devlin, Card best bet in
the two-mile, will face Henry
Sticher, who beat him last year and
looked good against California.
Templeton has a fine pair of mil
ers in Warren Dixon and Chuck
Nimmo, but under the conditions
prevailing they are no cinch to beat
Beverly Keim, the Bruin veteran
who has turned in fast times re
cently.
Four field events, the shot, dis
cus, javelin, and high jump, the old
standbys, should furnish about 30
points to the Card total, a very wel
come amount. Jim Reynolds in the
.shot, Jack King and Phil Levy in the
discus, Johnny Mottram and Dud
Sales in the javelin, and Humbert
Smith, Lloyd Schween, and Ken
Nobs in the high jump all have the
edge over their Wcstwood opponents.
The pole vault is all Uclan's.
Stanford's varsity track team,
minus a broad jumper and three
sprinters, leaves tonight for Los An
geles, where tomorrow they encoun
ter U.C.LA. in the Coliseum.
Condition, the old taskmaster, will
be the Cards' chief opponent. Rain
has caused them to mark time for
the last several weeks, while the
southland sun has shone upon the
Bruins, a team fortified with less
skill, but more luck than our boys.
Condition notwithstanding, a mod
erate but fairly accurate dope sheet
has the Cards winning by eight
points. But they have to win both
hurdles, 440, mile, and relay, and a

generous helping of seconds and
thirds. U.C.L.A. is given an edge in
the sprints, 880, two-mile, broad
jump, and pole vault.
Blackman vs. LuValle
To win the quarter Captain AI
Blackman will have to stay ahead of
Jimmy LuValle. And if the sepia
Bruin captain is in his old form it
will be quite a job. LuValle ran 46.9
in the East two years ago and beat
Blackman last year, but has been
out of shape so far this spring.
