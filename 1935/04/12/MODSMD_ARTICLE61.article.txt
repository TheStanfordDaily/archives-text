## CARDS MUST TRIP THE BRUINS 
### 
j Though even the San Francisco
1 newspapers are blissfully unaware
of it, Dink Templeton is taking his
: once-defeated 1935 track team to
1 Los Angeles tonight for a meet with
U.C.L.A. It will be the Indians'
second and la.st shot at competition
j before next Saturday's all-import
' ant Big Meet.
j Tomorrow Stanford will have an-
I other chance to show whether or not
' it is the feeble dual meet team that
the local experts have declared. The
i Cards have got to win, and they
know it.
