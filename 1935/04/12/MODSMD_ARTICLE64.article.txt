# S.C. TENNIS SQUAD TO COMPETE WITH CURDS TOMORROW
## Line-ups Uncertain as Law Downs Sammy Lee 
### 
Johnny Law defeated Captain
Sammy Lee in four sets late yes
; terday: 3-6, 6-3, (>-3, (i-3, 6-4, to
J take number one position on the
Stanford tennis varsity; so the
I only certain thing about tomor
j row's line-up is that six men will
j face Troy.
I .
i Last minute changes in bolh the
j Card and Trojan line-ups for tomor
j row's varsity matches seem likely
'according to Coach Sherman Lock-
I wood and word received from the
; South. The annual matches, which
[ are scheduled to get under way at 1
! o'clock, will be played on the cam
i pus courts.
The U.S.C. team, composed of Ver-
I non John, Charles Carr, Jack Kne
| meyer, Phil Woolcdge, Boyd Georgi,
j and Bob Rowley, â€¢ was considered
| fixed, but the name of a new man,
j George Burroughs, appears as a pos
! sibility for both singles and doubles,
j Lockwood is still undecided as to
| his choice between Bill Seward and
j Ben Dey to play third singles for the
! Indians. Dey's victory over Seward
j in a recent ladder match may mean
i that he occupies the third spot, or
j Seward may keep it to play Kne
i meyer, whose number Bill seams to
j have. Positions of the two sopho-
I mores depend largely on how the
i Trojans line up against California
this afternoon at Berkeley.
Lee Faces John
! Almost the only certain things
! about tomorrow's matches are that
| Captain Sammy Lee of Stanford will
! face Trojan Vernon John in the first
1 singles, and Johnny Law will meet
| U.S.C.'s Charley Carr in the second
tilt.
Seward and Dey will clash with
Knemeyer and Captain Wooledge of
the Trojans in the third and fourth
singles, although which Card will
play which U.S.C. man is unknown.
In all four matches Stanford is at
least slightly favored.
In the fifth singles Jack Lynch
rates a decided edge over Boyd
Georgi of the Trojans, having easily
conquered him after a slow start in
Los Angeles. Bob Pommer of Stan-
lord and Bob Rowley of U.S.C. will
meet in the sixth event, with Pom
mel- u narrow favorite.
Stanford Favored
One of the best matches of the
day should be that between Stan
ford's Lee and Pommer and Trojans
John Carr in the first doubles.
Seward and Dey may have trouble
with Knemeyer and Wooledge in the
second four-man tilt, but Law and
Lynch should easily triumph over
Georgi and Rowley in the third
doubles.
If Stanford maintains the form
which she has shown all season,
U.S.C. should go down to defeat by
at least a G-3 margin. The Indians
may reach their peaks and score a
clean sweep of the nine matches.
Frosh Meet Berkeley
Led by Bob Underwood and Bob
Braly, the Card frosh have an edge
over Berkeley High School at 9:30
tomorrow morning on the varsity
courts. The yearlings hope to get
into shape to defeat Modesto Junior
College and the Bear frosh next
week.
