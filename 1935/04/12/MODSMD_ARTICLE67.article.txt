# POLOISTS ENGAGE UTAH QUARTET IN FINAL GAME TODAY
## Visitors Have Chance To Avenge First Game 
### 
Poloists of the University of Utah
I will have an opportunity this after
| noon of avenging their decisive de
j feat Wednesday, when the visitors
j engage the championship-aspiring
i Indians on the highway field. This
final contest of the two-game series
will gt-t under way at 3' o'clock, ac
fording to Lt. H. Y, Grubbs, Stanford
coach.
| Despite the 12-to-2 verdict against
! them in the first game the Salt Lake
men appeared to be capable of bet
ter polo than they demonstrated.
The serious handicap of being forced
to play on strange mounts visibly
bothered the Utah men. With two
| days oi practice and an opportunity
jto become accustomed to Stanford
I horses, the visiting riders should be !
I able to give a much better account
I of themselves this afternoon.
Reserves to Play
Unless Utah displays sudden new ;
| strength today it is probable that ,
i Lt. Grubbs' second siring, which
l played fine polo in Wednesday's!
I game, will see considerable sei'vice. !
j This second string line-up consists of |
; Bill Enemark at No. 1, Jim Hend'er- j
son at No. 2, John Dwyer at No. 3 ;
| position, and Ed McKeon at No. 4. 1
In case of trouble, however, Lt. j
Grubbs will have his powerful var
sity combination of Carl Beal, Cap
tain Bill Rogers, Russ Rasmussen,
land Bob Fullerton ready to inject j
! into the fray.
J Lt. R. M. Cannon's Utah men will |
I probably use the same line-up they
| played in the first game with El
| wood Walker at No. 1, Captain Ar
j thur Pratt at No. 2, C. H. Wilchen at j
| No. 3, and Don Thompson at No. 4. j

The same system of direct cx- |
j change of pony strings between the

i cessfully used in the first encounter |

j make the distribution of desirable ,
mounts fair to the visitors.

i Lt. Grubbs' second siring, which
l played fine polo in Wednesday's!
I game, will see considerable sei'vice. !
j This second string line-up consists of |
; Bill Enemark at No. 1, Jim Hend'er- j
son at No. 2, John Dwyer at No. 3 ;
| position, and Ed McKeon at No. 4. 1
In case of trouble, however, Lt. j
Grubbs will have his powerful var
sity combination of Carl Beal, Cap
tain Bill Rogers, Russ Rasmussen,
land Bob Fullerton ready to inject j
! into the fray.
J Lt. R. M. Cannon's Utah men will |
I probably use the same line-up they
| played in the first game with El
| wood Walker at No. 1, Captain Ar
j thur Pratt at No. 2, C. H. Wilchen at j
| No. 3, and Don Thompson at No. 4. j
Exchange Mounts
The same system of direct cx- |
j change of pony strings between the
: two outfits at half time that was sue- j
i cessfully used in the first encounter |
| will be employed this afternoon to j
j make the distribution of desirable ,
mounts fair to the visitors.
A Danish geologist has found fos-
I sils of four-legged fish in Greenland
| that are believed to have been the
j connecting link between water and
J land-dwelling vertebi'ates.
Poloists of the University of Utah
I will have an opportunity this after
| noon of avenging their decisive de
j feat Wednesday, when the visitors
j engage the championship-aspiring
i Indians on the highway field. This
final contest of the two-game series
will gt-t under way at 3' o'clock, ac
fording to Lt. H. Y, Grubbs, Stanford
coach.
| Despite the 12-to-2 verdict against
! them in the first game the Salt Lake
men appeared to be capable of bet
ter polo than they demonstrated.
The serious handicap of being forced
to play on strange mounts visibly
bothered the Utah men. With two
| days oi practice and an opportunity
jto become accustomed to Stanford
I horses, the visiting riders should be !
I able to give a much better account
I of themselves this afternoon.
Reserves to Play
Unless Utah displays sudden new ;
| strength today it is probable that ,
