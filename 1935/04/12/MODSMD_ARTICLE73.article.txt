# Ball Team Set for Second Bear Game
## Indian Chances for VictorY Depend on Hustle 
### Bob Leland 
With but two games remaining on
the league schedule, the Indian ball
team spent the afternoon in light
practice for the second game of the
Cal series tomorrow at the Sunken
Diamond. The contest will start at
2:15.
In their first meeting, the Bears
won 5-3, hut it is doubtful if they
were really the- better team. This
time, however, "Lefty" Ilardt ts
scheduled to be on the mound for
the Berkeley nine. The way Stan
ford has been hitting, liardt should
not have much trouble subduing
the Indians.
However, there are things to be
said in favor of the Card chances,
since anything can happen in a ball
game. Cal cannot a fiord Lo take the
Redskins lightly, for such an attitude
i.; not conducive to hustling. No ball
club can win games without hustling
no matter how good its members
may be.
Victory Possible
There is some hope that the In
dians will snap out of their losing
streak. In the U.C.L.A. game the in
field functioned well most of the
time. Howell Turner played really
flossy ball rit second, thereby making
a sucker out of this scribe. Besides
handling his chances without an er
ror, he started a double play. Gordon
Mallatratt played his usual sparkling
game at first. From a purely im
partial standpoint it seems that ha
is one of the best, if not the best,
first Sc.eker in the league.
Ed Clark is a question mark. He
roams the short patch with appar
ent case and fields well, but when it
comes to throwing to first he be
comes uncertain and erratic. Nearly
all the errors charged to him have
been on pegs to first. He and Frank
Tremaine are in the same leaky boat.
I< they can come down to tarth ihe
Stanford infield will stand up with
the best.
Outfielders Show Class
As for the outfield, it is good.
Bones Hamilton, Ted Leidig, and co-
Captain Heringer, or A1 Brent, com
pose as good a combination as there
is in the league. Hamilton and Leidig
are both fast in covering territory
and both are good hitters. Bones is
especially adept at beating out
bunts.
Just who will start on the mound
Saturday is in doubt. Anderson lias
had more rest, but Heringer pitched
:;reat ball in the six innings he
worked against the Bruins. Campbell
may get the call, since he pitched
only three frames in the Uclan con
test and should be well rested.
The greatest handicap the Indians
will have to overcome is weak hit
ting. So far, outside of Leidig, Mal
latratt, Hamilton, and Heringer, the
stick work has been impotent in the
matter of driving in runs. Poor base
running has also contributed to the
Redskins' downfall on occasions.
