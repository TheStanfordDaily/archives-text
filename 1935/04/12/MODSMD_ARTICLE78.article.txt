### 
Speaking of relay teams and the
Big Meet, Coach Brutus Hamilton
picked a new anchor man for the
Bear quartet at the Trojan meet last
Saturday, replacing Everett Leek
with sophomore Jim Helmer.

one of the Coast's best 440 men,
who had already finished two yards
ahead of Helmer in the preceding
440-yard dash. Helmer had a yard
lead at the start, but Vejar came
with a rush on the back stretch,
and drew up alongside the Bear
runner. Helmer determinedly held

; the pole around the curve. Coining

' a kick that he took -i four-yard
lead over the man who had pre
! viously defeated him.
Last Saturday Helmer ran a highly
j commended anchor lap, slaying ever

I Coast's best, whose four-yard leac
wouldn't be cut down.

competitive ability that the U.C.
fans have been unable to unearth
is a story of a Cal frosh-ptep all
star meet several" years ago when
Helmer was running anchor for the
all-star half-mile relay team. Hel
mer got the baton twenty yards to
the rear of the Cub runner, but,
to the amazement of the spectators
! who thought the race was as good
as over, made up the margin with-
