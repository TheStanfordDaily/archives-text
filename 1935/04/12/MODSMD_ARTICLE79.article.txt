Last Year for Dwyer
This wiil be the last California
match lor several of the veteran
Stanford golfers. The men who
are going into final action are
Torn Dwyer, who is in the top ,
spot on the Stanford ladder; Jack
Hoerner, University champion and ;
present number 3 man, and Bill ;
Hoelle, who is playing number 8.
The other men who will see action
tomorrow are "Spec" Stewart, num
ber 2 man; Don Edwards, number 4 ,
man; Max Stoddard, number 5 man;
Bob Thompson, number 6, and Morse

With the exception of Max Slod
dard, who came up from the fresh

that met the California men and fell
before their superior golf at the
Orinda Country Club- This time they
have pointed carefully and practiced
diligently for victory and according ,
to the fence birds they are going to
make it.
Frosh Favored
The frosh are entering the matches
with very good chances of continu
ing their record. In the first position
is Jack Wallace, the second is Louis
Cass, who won the California State !
Intercollegiate Frosh title at Del |
Monte last quarter. In the third is
; Brown Cannon, Rocky Mountain
| flash who has shown up well here.
The others in descending order are:
Landon Wheeler, Pete Hass, Alan

in 150 yards and won with plenty
! to spare.,
When asked what he thought when
he got the baton, Helmer said, "Well,
| I had a hard time deciding whether
jto pass him before or after the
! curve." Not that the twenty-yard
I lead was worth worrying about.
The big meet relay should be a
j thriller.
