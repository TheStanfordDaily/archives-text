## Senate Leaders Favor New Anti-War Strikes 
### 
WASHINGTON. April 11 (Special
to the Daily).â€”Four members of the
special Senate committee investigat
ing the armaments industry today
had joined in support of the nation
wide student strike against war,
called for April 12.
Senator Homer T. Bone, of Wash
ington, in a forceful statement,
joined his colleagues, Senators Nye,
Clark, and Pope, who had earlier
expressed approval of the pacifist
demonstration.
"Certainly anything which consti
tutes so grave a challenge to civiliza
tion as war should invoke the active
interest of students as well as all of
our citizens who value our social
institutions," Senator Bone said.
"I hope that every effort will be
made to arouse public sentiment to a
realization of the gravity of the pres
ent situation, the imminence of war,
and the necessity of keeping out of
any conflict. The strike should indi
cate the trend of student opinion."
Senator James Hamilton Lewis, of
Illinois, commenting on ihc proposed
student strike against war, April 12,
said:
"I think it unfortunate that stu
dents should be called upon to strike
for anything. I believe that strikes
are bad methods for gaining an end.
Certainly they are bad for students."
