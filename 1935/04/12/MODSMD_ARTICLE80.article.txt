# FENCERS MEET U.C. MEN TODAY
## 
### 
In a toss-up series of matches,
Stanford'* varsity and frosh fencers
will engage the California Bears in
Ihe Berkeley gym at 3 o'clock this
afternoon. Yearling matches, of
which there will be nine, will start
at that hour, with 25 varsity clashes
immediately following.
Last fall the Indians defeated Cali
fornia by an 18-7 margin in the
Herron trophy matches. Since Stan
ford no longer has the services of
Oliver Bowen, captain and number
one man on the team at that lime,
today's competition should be much
closer.
Foilsmen going to Berkeley with
Coach Elwyn Bugge are Dick Fer
guson, Louis Lataillado, Jack Les
ley, Dwight Strong, and A1 Dole,
representing the varsity, and Carl
Ferguson, Lan Swent, Ed Woods, and
A1 Henley lor the frosh. One of the
four first men will be an alter
nate, but which three will actually
compete is still uncertain.
The Cardinals will be especially
anxious to win these matches, since
last year's varsity lost, 13 to 12, and
the frosh also came out on the short
end. Captain Ashley is the star of
the 1935 Bear fencers, and the re
sults of his matches with Dick Fer
guson and Lataillade, Indian aces,
will have a strong bearing on ihe
outcome of the team matches.
