Opening Friday's peace day pro
gram with an all-University assem
bly at 11 o'clock in the morning,
student speakers brought home sev
eral wholesome truths to a relatively
small audience.
After a few introductory re
marks by President Ray Lyman
Wilbur, Kenny Livingston spoke,
bringing out the point that de
struction can be the only outcome
of war, and the fact that the world
cannot mark time but must change.
He claimed that education must
answer this problem of change,
and therefore it is our responsi
bility.
Livingston was followed by Fred
Bold, who spoke on "Preparedness as
a Means of Safeguarding Peace." Us
ing the childhood simile "You won't
pick on me if I'm a big guy," he
claimed that we .should prepare for
peace to avoid war, since arms are a
means of pursuing war, rather than
a cause of it.
Praises Preparedness
In conclusion he said that an addi
tional asset of preparedness was that
it helped to alleviate war talk; and
finally that, until disarmament can
be universally attained, we must
have preparedness for protection.
Dave Mellinkoff, resplendent in
peace-inspiring white, followed Bold
with a discussion of "The League of
Nations: Not a Dodo but a Dream."
He began by saying that the realiza
tion that war is hell had caused the
nations to "engage in competitive
sin to see who could go to hell the
fastest," and added that "Passing the
buck had become an international
sport."
Divides People
His second claim was that we are
divided into two sets of people: those
who want peace, and those who read
the Hearst papers. There must be
some form of international organiza
tion to prevent conflict, and the
League, although it is far from per
fect, is better than nothing.
Spencer Thompson concluded the
assembly with a talk on "The War
Interest in Capitalism." Saying that
in their search for new markets the
huge corporative interests have used
the threat of war against the other
nations, he added that it was these
same capitalist groups who control
the war policy of the country, and
that it was through their desire for
profits that we were led into war
in 1914.
