# GERMANY JOINS OTHER NATIONS IN PEACE AIM
## Britain, Italy, and France Renew Locarno Pact; Promise Rhine Amity 
### 
GENEVA, April 14 (/}'}. —A united
front for peace rather than a united
front against Germany was the key
note in Geneva tonight on the eve
of the special session of the League
of Nations council.
There was censure for Germany,
however, in two communiques which
were made public during the day—
one at Stresa where the France-
Brit ain-Italy conferences ended yes
terday, and one here.
Germany Urged
Both the French appeal to the
league here and the communique
at Stresa are deemed as constituting
urgent bids to Germany to partici
pate in binding European peace ar
rangements. Both, too, are seen here
as emphasizing the need for accords
that must be lived up to if Europe
would avert a reign of force.
The reaffirmation of Britain and
Italy at Stresa that they will fulfill
their pledges under the Locarno
treaty to guarantee peace on the
Rhine is considered a powerful in
fluence in Europe's efforts to pre
vent war.
Pact Renewed
The Locarno agreement, formu
lated just 10 years ago, entails mili
tary assistance from Britain and
Italy in the event of unprovoked
agression upon Germany. It is still
considered the most potent pact in
Europe. The action of Italy and
Britain in reaffirming their respon
sibilities was an unexpected addi
tion to the results of the Stresa con
ference.
The French protest against Ger
many's repudiation of the arma
ment stipulations of the Versailles
treaty, made public in full today,
refrained from demanding a specific
penalizing of Germany.
