# FRESHMEN WIN DEBATE HONORS
## Hartmann, Stein Place In Coast Tournament 
### 
Triumphing over 15 junior college
and freshman teams from leading
Coast institutions, Stanford's fresh
man debate team of Robert Hart
mann and Joel Stein placed first
Saturday in the junior division of
the California Coast League invita
tional tournament held in San
Francisco.
Both experienced members of
the frosh squad, Ilartmann and
Stein debated each side of the
question: "Resolved, that the col
lege youth of today should be im
bued with nationalism rather than
internationalism."
Winning a large silver loving cup
for the University and individual
cups for themselves, they defeated
the crack team from Menlo Junior
College to win the championship of
the two-day tournament. In addi
tion to captaining the winning de
bate team, Hartmann also placed
third in the ex tempore speaking
finals, with the topic, "The economic
boycott and its use in the preserva
tion of peace."
Only Stanford's freshman team,
which included also Freshman Man
ager Wayne Richardson, William
Breeding and George Halloran, en
tered the tournament. Breeding
and Halloran, after making a bril
liant display of forensic ability,
were eliminated in the semi
finals.
