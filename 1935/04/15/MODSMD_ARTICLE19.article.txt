# Increase of Women Brings New Problems of Orientation
## 
### BARBARA ROSENBLATT 
Although the freshmen women 1
may not know it, they have been the |
object of an experiment being con- }
ducted by Women's Conference and i
the administration.
The innovation of having all fresh- ;
men women living together in Roble !
necessitated a new method of ad- !
ministration. Approximately twice |
as many new women had to be ori- j
ented, as compared with former !
years. This difficult task was left in
the hands of sponsors and admin- ;
istrators, whose duty it was in the i
first two quarters of school to toll I
the freshmen the whys and where
fores of Stanford.
At the beginning of spring quar- j
tcr, all but .six of the older girls I
moved out of Roble, and the remain- '
ing are there unofficially.
The question now arises as to \
whether the experiment has been a
success. Success, in the eyes of
Women's Conference, is the ability
of the freshmen to manage Roble j
successfully, and to become a real 1
part of the university.
Studies Ncglcctcd
If, by the end of the year, it is de
cided that the freshmen women have
upheld the standards which people
have learned to expect from Stan
ford Women, the experiment will be
come as much a part of the curricu
lum as citizenship.
However, one main objection has
been raised already, and that is the !
fact that the freshmen were so en
grossed in trying to distinguish the
law steps from the English Comei
steps, trying to find the little theater, j

and attending various and sundry
teas given to make the little women

[ feel at home, that they forgot for Ihe
) first week or two the purpose of
I Stanford—namely the indulgence in
| scholastic activities.
To Arrive Early i
To counteract this neglect, which
I caused approximately half of the
i freshmen to go minus — a horrid
] word—a new plan has been formu
• latcd by Women's Conference, which
would go into effect next year.
This plan is that freshmen women
(be required to arrive on the campus
j two days before registration. Dur
ing these two days they would go
I through a period of orientation, con
i ducted by the sponsors and admin
j istrators. All the fol-de-rol, which
j this year took up part of the time
I regularly devoted to academic pur
j suit, would be incorporated into
I these two days, and immediately
| following registration books would
be the main order of the day.
Plan Institute
This spring a leaders' institute,
j consisting of next year's sponsors,
administrators, and living group
i presidents, will be held to train the
! above-mentioned for their respective
positions, according to Marion Stor
ey, A.W.S. president and active
backer of the proposed plan. Train
ing in this institute will include talks
by Dr. Gilbert Wrenn and Dr. Doro
thy Heilman The information de
rived from these talks will in turn
be passed on to the freshmen next
fall.
However, any changes that will be
made next year rest with the suc
cess of this year's experiment, and
[the possibility of it technically.

Although the freshmen women 1
may not know it, they have been the |
object of an experiment being con- }
ducted by Women's Conference and i
the administration.
The innovation of having all fresh- ;
men women living together in Roble !
necessitated a new method of ad- !
ministration. Approximately twice |
as many new women had to be ori- j
ented, as compared with former !
years. This difficult task was left in
the hands of sponsors and admin- ;
istrators, whose duty it was in the i
first two quarters of school to toll I
the freshmen the whys and where
fores of Stanford.
At the beginning of spring quar- j
tcr, all but .six of the older girls I
moved out of Roble, and the remain- '
ing are there unofficially.
The question now arises as to \
whether the experiment has been a
success. Success, in the eyes of
Women's Conference, is the ability
of the freshmen to manage Roble j
successfully, and to become a real 1
part of the university.
Studies Ncglcctcd
If, by the end of the year, it is de
cided that the freshmen women have
upheld the standards which people
have learned to expect from Stan
ford Women, the experiment will be
come as much a part of the curricu
lum as citizenship.
However, one main objection has
been raised already, and that is the !
fact that the freshmen were so en
grossed in trying to distinguish the
law steps from the English Comei
steps, trying to find the little theater, j

and attending various and sundry
teas given to make the little women

[ feel at home, that they forgot for Ihe
) first week or two the purpose of
I Stanford—namely the indulgence in
| scholastic activities.
To Arrive Early i
To counteract this neglect, which
I caused approximately half of the
i freshmen to go minus — a horrid
] word—a new plan has been formu
• latcd by Women's Conference, which
would go into effect next year.
This plan is that freshmen women
(be required to arrive on the campus
j two days before registration. Dur
ing these two days they would go
I through a period of orientation, con
i ducted by the sponsors and admin
j istrators. All the fol-de-rol, which
j this year took up part of the time
I regularly devoted to academic pur
j suit, would be incorporated into
I these two days, and immediately
| following registration books would
be the main order of the day.
Plan Institute
This spring a leaders' institute,
j consisting of next year's sponsors,
administrators, and living group
i presidents, will be held to train the
! above-mentioned for their respective
positions, according to Marion Stor
ey, A.W.S. president and active
backer of the proposed plan. Train
ing in this institute will include talks
by Dr. Gilbert Wrenn and Dr. Doro
thy Heilman The information de
rived from these talks will in turn

fall.
