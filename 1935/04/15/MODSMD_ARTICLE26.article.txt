! power, the Card track team out-
I pointed the Bruins 82-49 before a

Nine new meet records were es
i tablished during the afternoon and

I counted for six of the broken marks

j three.
Broad Jump Weak
The Cards were weak in the
1 broad jump, pole vault, and sprints,
| however. Bruins finished one, two,
! three in the broad jump, when none
of the Stanford men could better 22
! feet. Two Uclans tied for first in the
pole vault, (he best an Indian could
j clear being 13 feet, and the Stan
j fordites looked pretty slow in the
; sprints.
In the feature match of the after
noon, the quarter-mile race between
(Jimmy LuVaile and A1 Blackmail,
the Card captain showed his heels to
j the Bruin star, passing him 10 yards
from the finish and winning easily
j in 47.8, though he could have cut his
i time considerably. Truck Dellinger
| came up fast at the finish to take
| third from Ray Vejar.
j With Paul Green and Alan
J Cranston, Blackman and Dellinger
| went on to win the relay in the
I fast time of 3 minutes 14.5 seconds,
! one of the fastest relays ever run
on the Co'v>t and within onc
j tenth second of the Coliseum rec
ord.
LuVaile won the 220 easily in 21.5.
lln the half, Murphy finished first
j with Rusty March of the Cards right
; behind him. Warren Dixon won the
I mile for the Indians in 4 minutes 26.8
| seconds, and Dave Devlin, veteran
j Stanford distance man, took first in
the two-mile in 9 minutes 51.9 sec
i onds.
Take Hurdles <
Stanford's Sammy Klopstock was
! the only double winner of the day,
J taking both high and low hurdles.
! He made the high in 14.6, the low in
123.6. Hunt Kingsbury finished a
'close second in the highs, nosing out
Dwire of the Bruins, but finishing
| back of Dwire in the lows.
Cardinal weight men came
through as expected sweeping both
shot and discus. Keith Carlin,
U.C.L.A. sophomore, showed the
best improvement, placing third in
j the javelin with 197 feet 3 3/10
; inches, 10 feet further than he had
