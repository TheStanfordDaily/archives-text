# Equality in Capability â€“ Not in Numbers
## 
### 
In the midst () f the transition from a men's
school to a normal coeducational institution,
Stanford has undergone noticeable mechani
cal rearrangement. Asa result it is faced with
the necessity of accepting the accompanying
social changes.
That Stanford women merit greater consid
eration in campus alfairs and in student gov
ernment is becoming increasingly obvious. A
more fair percentage of representation in the
future is inevitable.
With the live-to-one ratio of men to women
under the old ".">(10" set-up the women's view
point was of only minor interest to the campus
as a whole. Women had their own little group,
the A.W.S., which neither interfered with the
Ex <loin inittee nor was consulted by them in
handling student alfairs. In short, the man
ning power of the t'niversity was truly man
power, and the women look what was given
them without the force of numbers to object.
The proportion of .women on the Eann has
changed. Realization of their increased im
portance was made apparent to some extent
by new provisions for women's positions in
the recently adopted A.S.S.L 1 . constitution.
it seems incredible, however, that even in
the partially corrected stage of transformation
in which Stanford finds itself today, an Asso
ciated Students dramatic presentation could
be selected which provides for l\~) male char
acters and possibility for only one actress to
have a part.
Stanford women will never be able to gel
far with a campaign for "equality of women"
for they will always be outnumbered by men,
but it seems only reasonable that their equal
ity of capability should he utilized.
In spile of their one-third percentage in the
student body, it will not always be that Stan
ford women will remain acquiescent with a
place in student government only through the
notoriously uninlluenlial positions of vice
president of the A.S.S.U., women's editor of
the Daily, and a minority on the Ex Com
mittee.
This edition of the Daily, written and put
