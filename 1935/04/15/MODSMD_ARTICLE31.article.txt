II would he lolly to start a rumpus war on
the question of modern college women's intel
lectual equality with their masculine class
males, for science proves that there is no sex
in hrain cells. Yet it is of interest to note
the recent fomentation of indignation on the
Northwestern I diversity campus when Pro
fessor John Morgan of the psychology depart
ment said that college girls pretend to he dumh
in order to make men feel superior.
Professor Morgan's statements, concerned
with an assumption he <idmits to he without
laboratory experimentation, caused much ad
verse criticism in women's dormitories and
sorority houses. Whatever grain of truth his
remarks might have as regards Northwestern
women, it is certain that the psychologist
would lin<l little hasis for such an idea \<ith
Stanford's feminine element.
Any Stanford professor who attempted to
have it believed that women students feigned
dumbness in order to keep their heroes from
acquiring an inferiority complex would be
laughed at and justly.
Women are as well read as men, and in an
increasing number of cases are able to talk
intelligently on subjects formerly considered
lo be strictly masculine topics of conversation.
Probably the cause for the Northwestern pro
lessor's mistaken idea of women's actions is
their willingness to admit lack of knowledge
on a particular subject and their eagerness to
become better informed through inquiry and
discussion.
