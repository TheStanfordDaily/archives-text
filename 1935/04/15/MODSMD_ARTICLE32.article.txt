# Repeat Performance for Gertrude
## 
### 
(iertrude Stein is coining again. She will
be here on Wednesday night, and all the curi
osity seekers who weren't in on the first sing
ing lesson will shell out good money to see
the feminine "intellectual."
The Knglish CJub knows when il has a good
thing. Ergo, repeat it until the people get tired.
It's the same principle as a box olliee attrac
tion at the theater. Mill (iertrude reached the
point of diminishing returns long ago. She
is merely trying to coast along on marginal
utility now.
Miss Stein is no fool. When her audience
laughs, she laughs right along. (>1 course the

question arises as to whether she really is
laughing with them or merely ut them. The
argument that every generation has its great
genius there was a Tennyson, and an Emer
son, and now there is a Stein, and someone
may eome along to supplant her in the next
generation is a hit questionable, at least so
lur as Stein is eoneerneil.
No one can deny that her American lecture
tour has been a ripping success. Thousands
ol women's club members have come to listen,
and remained to laugh at .Miss Stein's habit of
pushing her hair forward and scratching her
nose. However, newspaper people are always
apt to he a bit cynical, and perhaps the Eng
lish (Jul) and Stein lloat somewhere above in
the transcendental aurora of higher Knowl
edge.
Or then again, maybe thev 100 approve of
the idea ol gathering shekels where they may.
