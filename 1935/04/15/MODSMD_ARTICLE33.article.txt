## MIDWEST DUST STORMS—PETTENGILL 
### Annalee Whitmore 
Travelers in the Middle West pass through mite
alter mile of land entirely covered by drifting powder
dry soil. Each dust-laden wind brings destruction to
crops already hurt by drought, and each headline an
nounces a new area hit by the storms.
This xritical situation, says Robert B. Pettengill of
the Department of Economics, can be traced back to
the World War. European countries then depended on
tlie United States for food. We put under the plow
much of the short-grass region of the western prairies,
ci tet t itory with low rainfall, previously considered im
possible to cultivate. This marginal agricultural land
had formerly been used for cattle raising, and had been
covered with buffalo grass.
Attempts to farnt the l"wid since the war are
now facing adverse economic conditions mainly
due to the scanty rainfall. We are now witnessing
the stage of drought which, alter year upon year
of low rainfall, has reached the extent that normal
plant growth has virtually disappeared. The land
surface is loose and powdery; every high wind
raises dust clouds.
"I agree," said Pettengill, "with those who feel that
(here is no solution for the problem unless the govern
ment takes over the land, restoring large parts to sod
instead of plow crops (of which there is an over
supply). This will help to overcome the overproduc
tion of farm crops as well as prevent erosion, which is
harmful to wide regions where it is blown as dust.
"This situation nr\y force the United States to
sanction a degree of domination of industry ap
proximating socialism," he said. "The problem de
mands collective action by the government, with
purchase and utilization of land. We are l>eing
forced to it.
"Even rabid individualists, if they face the prob
lem fairly, must agree that collective action is dras
tically needed."
Exploitation of America's natural resources has been
largely accomplished by individuals. The choice is now
between further waste and preservation, the latter
necessary for a sound policy in the future. The same
situation existed in our oil supply—wild catters drilled
wastefully and unhampered. America's tradition of
freedom must be altered in order to conserve re
sources. The government must buy land and prevent
dust storms from destroying further crops and settle
ments.
Tree planting, thinks Pettengill, is not the solu
tion, mainly because rainfall is not sufficient to
support most forms of tree life. Windbreaks, to be
efficient, must be planted in the eastern territory,
where rainfall is greater.
Perennial, not annual, grass, seems to be necessary
to keep the land in place, although portions may be
irrigated, to aid in solving the problem.
The AAA's attempts to raise prices of foodstuffs
have been severely criticized for the present shortage
of supply, he added. Drought, rather than crop re
striction, he believes to be the real cause, accounting
for ten times the shortage brought about by the AAA.
The increased price of wheat is said to benefit farm
ers. "You should remember that this conclusion is
reached by averaging the net income to agriculture,"
he pointed out, "which leaves out those farmers in
drought area prevented from raising a crop of any
kind. Outside this area crops have been enhanced in
value, actual suffering exists in the dust-storm area."
Figures on erosion are sufficient to stagger the
imagination. Soil, the natural resource for which no
.substitute is possible, is going to waste unnoticed. One
godsend might be discovered in wind-erosion, con
cludes Mr. Pettengill, in that it will make us conscious
ol the actual danger to agriculture.
