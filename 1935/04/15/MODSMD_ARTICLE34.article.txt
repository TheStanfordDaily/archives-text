# OUR HASHER SEZ:
## 
### 
It is a long, long time, my friends, since I last sat
down to write "Our Hasher Sez" for a Women's Edition
of The Daily. In fact, this is tho first time there has
been a Women's Edition since "Our Hasher Sez"
sprang full-fledged from the brain of Our Hasher,
a la Minerva. Anyway, as a result of the effort,
I'minervous wreck. (Pause for laughter.)
Well, that's over! Ever since The Editor pointed a
burly finger at me last Friday and said in a loud voice:
"You write 'Our Hasher' for the Women's Edition,
minion - ' (my middle name is Minion), I have been
haunted by the thought, "I must think of a pun. I must
think of a pun. It wouldn't be 'Our Hasher' without
a pun." Now I can rest in peace.
I must confess right now, hesitatingly, that I—l'm
really not a hasher. In fact, my hashing experience has
been limited to helping at the recent Peace Conference
dinner, where I served up soup, nuts, and what goes
with them to a tableful of psychology professors. Hash
ing i.s all very well, but not for psychology professors.
You see. there is always the danger that they might
read your mind while you are struggling v.ith a tray
ful of steaming coffee cups or passing the rolls for the
tenth time. (If any psychology professors read this—
I was only joking.)
There is an unwritten law at Lagunita Court that
none of the girls arrives at the dinner table with her
hair screwed up in curlers or fastened down by bobby
pins. Likewise, the hashers forbid the removal of
any food from the dining room. I nominate for the
Hall of Fame the young damsel who recently not only
dared to come to the table with her entire front frizz
entangled in bobby-pins but even attempted to carry
off a plate of butter (with which to make fudge) while
so bedecked. "The nerve!" fumed the irate head
hasher, who chased her into the court and rescued
the butter. "And with that wireworks in her hair!"
(Let it bo added that he, too, appreeiated such valor,
however, for he tried to date her the very next week
end.)
The life of a hasher is hard. I admit, but sometimes
the life of the consumer is equally hard. When a group
of Robleites swore off talking aboul the food last
work they found themselves reduced to discussing cach
other's table manners.
