# CAMPUS OPINION
## SAN JOSE EXPULSION 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Your terse dispatch Thursday on
the expulsion of June Phares Wills
from San Jose State College declares
that Miss Wills was disqualified for
"creating a disturbance along com
munistic lines."
The quoted words are, presum
ably, those of Dr. MacQuarrie in
justifying his position. Since Dr.
MacQuarrie is a leading member of
the parish red-baiting circles, it is
not surprising that he should evoke
the fashionable communist bogey in
disposing of all dissenting opinion.
He has done this before, and there
are very good indications that he
will continue to do it.
But the truth of the matter is
communism has nothing whatever to
do with the dismissal of June Wills,
and Dr. MacQuarrie very well
knows it. Miss Wills was not in the
first place "creating a disturbance,"
but peacefully circulating a leaflet
publicizing the April 12th student
strike. She was not acting under
communist authorization, but in the
name of a joint strike committee on
which no communist group was rep
resented.
In resorting to this fascist method
of intimidation, Dr. MacQuarrie has
proved that he will go to any ex
tremity to suppress minority opin
ion. While he permits himself such
infamies of assertions as: "War is
stimulating and interesting," and has
"advantages for most of the partici
pants" (Spartan Daily), he yet has
the temerity to abuse the powers of
his office by holding the threat of

| expulsion over anyone with a con- j
| trary opinion.
No college president in the United
States has ever dragged the dignity i
of a high public office to such depths |
of jingoistic fatuity. Dr. MacQuar
rie stands utterly discredited by his
* wn hand.
Sincerely,
R. Lyndon
