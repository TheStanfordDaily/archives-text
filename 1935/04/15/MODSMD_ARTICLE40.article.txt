# KENNETH IS PERTURBED
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Little Stanley has sold his birth- j
right for a mess of pottage. Pottage j
that someday Stan will realize is I
only infected tripe.
| Stan is now engaged in further- i
ing the great San Simeon Burden— j
to poison a nation with the ptomaines !
of fear and hatred.
NOW THAT—
Stan has sold his soul to the devil, j
please ask him to cut his "Stanford" |
apron strings; for we resent the im- j
plication that we are tagging along i
1 behind him.
Ken Livingston
