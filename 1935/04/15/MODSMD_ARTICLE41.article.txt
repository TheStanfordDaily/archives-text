# CAT SESSION

### 
Five gimlet-eyed women sit
! around in a circle, confronting a re
calcitrant freshman. "Will you
j please explain your lockout of Fri
! day, April 12?" asks the chairman of
| the convening Committee of Five.
| "Well," begins the nervous frosh in
! a shaky voice, "on the way home
| from the City Friday night we had
| a blowout on the Bayshore. That
| made us 15 minute late."
"Flat tire excuses are not ac
| cepted," asserts the chairman, and
! the freshman is summarily sentenced
! to a lockout during the next week
! end.
In this hypothetical judgment of
i the Roble Committee of Five of a
I case which occurs again and again,
i there are several legitimate gripes.
! Following a policy laid down by
j Women's Council, the Committee of
Five in Roble, Lagunita, and Union
! arbitrarily disregard all flat tire and
watch excuses. This ruling is in di
j rect violation of the spirit of the
honor code. Instead of going on the
assumption that the offenders who
appear before them are telling the
j truth, these bodies assume that the
offenders are dyed-in-the-wool story
tellers, ready to use these excuses as
, a dodge.
Thus the unfortunate city-goers
who struggle by the side of the
Bayshore, changing flat tires at 2
; o'clock in the morning, are placed in
, the same category as the very occa
sional deliberate liar, who has no
more originality than to present this
time-worn excuse.
Through this ruling the lockout of
; fender is encouraged to fabricate an
acceptable excuse in place of the
true but disregarded tale of the flat
tire.
j Much high feeling has been arous

] Ed in Lagunita, Roble, and the Union
| by the increasingly severe penalties
j for lockouts, being meted out by the
1 respective Committees of Five and
Women's Council. These disciplinary
groups are antagonizing the "1000."
The old spirit of co-operation is gone.
Smarting under what they feel are
injustices, many of the "1000" are
coming to the conclusion that they
might as well put as much over on
'the committees as they are able
to do.
They are beginning to realize the
truth in the frosh bible's definition of
a lockout. "Don't worry, littfe girl.
| They don't lock you out. They let
i you in and give you hell!"
