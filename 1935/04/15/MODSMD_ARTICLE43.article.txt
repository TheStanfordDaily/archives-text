## U.C. Squad Takes Singles; Loses on Doubles 
### Virginia Hawkes 
In the annual California-Stanford
golf matches played Saturday on the
Stanford course the Card team, rated
as one of the best in the country, de
feated the Bears 17-10. At the same
time the Stanford frosh walloped the
Bt'iir Cubs 26V2-V2.
The Bears were surprisingly strong
in the singles, scoring 7'L* of their 10
points in these matches and making
it look for a time like they would
outscore the Indians in this depart
ment. Winning two of the three
doubles matches, however, the Cards
were ensured of victory.
Tom Dwyer was the only Stan
ford man to lake all three points
in his singles match. In (lie doubles
matches the hist score was turned
in by Stoddard and Thompson,
\v!h> carded a 08.
The Card babes, continuing their
winning streak, made a clean sweep
of the singles matches and lost only
one-half point in the doubles to the
Dear yearlings.
