IN SPORTS

i Of the 1000 women at Stanford G73

women, but just the same there are
i about as many women in propor
tion active in beneficial sports as
there are men. Sports on the wom->
| en's calendar for the year include
hockey, basketball, swimming, ten
j nis, golf, fencing, archery, riding,

A.F.W.C. REMOVES
RESTRICTION

WOMEN TO HAVE i
INTRAMUKAL

One of (lie most important de-
I cisions rendered at the Western
| Division convention of the
AJ\W.C. at Mills College a week
ago was to the effect next year
! Coast women may have intereol
j legiatc competition if they so de
! sire.
This means that the A.F.C.W. re
striction on intercollegiate athletics
for women has been removed and
next year at Tri-sports Day, for in-
I stance, points can be awarded to the
j individual schools instead of to the
various classes, frosh, soph; etc., as
| is customary under the stupid system
! prevailing this year.

W.A.A. has taken a big step for
ward in planning intramural sports
competition for women next fall—a
! step that definitely should be taken
if interest in athletics is to continue
I or increase. The board has appointed
J Frances Strong intramural manager
j for next year (the office will be
j elective after that) and the faculty
advisor will be Marie Manchee, who
has had experience with intramural
organization at Fresno Slate. To
gether the two should be able to
work out a good program.
With four halls and nine houses
to enter teams the plan should he
successful. Intramural would form
the only extra-curricular sports
activity for women. As the system
i now works, every woman has to
join a gym class to be eligible for
a class team. This requirement
1 would he eliminated and more
women would come out for ath

• letics, women who might other
wise feel they hadn't time for
; sports.
Intramural competition should
promote friendly contacts and keen
ier interest in sport*. To the win
ning team and the runner-up in
each sport intramural points will be
awarded, and the team amassing the
greatest number of points through
out. the year will be awarded a cup.
j The men have worked out a suc
cessful system—there is no reason
why a similar plan should not suc
ceed for the women. The fine qual
ity of sportsmanship, the definite
! physical benefit attained, cannot
help but promote that very desir
! able goal—better sportsmanship and
i wholesome athletics for the women
of Stanford.
