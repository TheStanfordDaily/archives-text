## 
### 
Stanford's polo quartet again
proved its superiority over Univer
sity of Utah poloists Friday after
noon, taking the final contest of the
two-game series 11-2.
In a rather slow game the visitors
were outridden and outplayed by
the Indian four. The Card first
string saw action during the first
two chukkers only but piled up
seven counters in that time. The
Utah men didn't break into the scor
ing until the third period when C. H.
Wilehen scored two goals.
Captain Bill Rogers, Russ Ras
mussen, and Carl Beal all made
two goals and Bob Fullerton ac
counted for one in the two periods
the varsity saw action. Jim Hender
son, John Dwyer, and Ed McKeon of
the second-string line-up, each add
ed another score. John Coffin scored
once when the third team entered
the fray.
