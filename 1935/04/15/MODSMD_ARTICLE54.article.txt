ica's feminine swimming stars of
the more or less immediate future
may be coming along, but the "big
three," Katherine Rawls, Lenore
Kight, and Eleanor Holm Jarrett,
are giving them precious little op
portunity to prove it.
Among them, the trio completely
dominated the 1935 National A.A.U.
championship meet in everything
but the diving events. But for a
rule restricting each individual to
four events, Miss Rawls probably
could have taken over a diving title.
