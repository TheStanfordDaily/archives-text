# CARDINAL VARSITY FOILSMEN DEFEAT BEAR TEAM 13-12

### 
In a close but uneventful mutch
I Friday afternoon Stanford varsity
j foilsmen beat the Cal squad 13 to 12,
j while the frosh lost to the Bear
| yearlings by one point, the score be
\ ing 5-4.
Though the Stanford team, coach
jed by Harry Maloney and Elwyn
I Bugge, was captainle*s, with Jerry
Bowen out of school this quarter, it
j showed a decided advantage of
I strength over its foes. Sadly, the
| Cards loosened up after the half
j when the score was 8 to 4 in their
I favor. Gradually the Cal men crept
jup on their adversaries but were
i finally vanquished in the critical
i bout in which Dick Ferguson repre
! sented Stanford.
i No hair-raising thrillers were wit
-1 nessed, no amazing feats displayed,
| but Louis Lataillade and Ferguson—
j Stanford fencers—each winning four
I bouts, proved likely rivals for suc
cessorship to Jerry Bo wen's cap
taincy of the Card squad. Jack Les
lie and Dwight Strong each won
three combats for Stanford and A1
Dole won one.

The whole of Canada has less j
! people than the city of New York.
