# Trustees Plan Debt Payments
## 
### 
Between 15 and 18 years will be
required to pay off the theater debt,
said President Marvic Kahn last
night. Plans for financial arrange
ments were approved last week by
the Board of Trustees, and as a re
sult the campus will have the new
theater by 1937, but will be in debt
unlil approximately 1952.
A down payment of $50,000 will be
paid by means of the 1934-35 student
dues of $1 per quarter, plus GO per
cent of (he Union profits for the same
period. To this will be added the
Memorial Fund raised to honor
Stanford men killed in the World
War.
After this first payment about
$25,000 a year will be applied to the
debt. The dollar per student per
quarter will total about $10,000 each
year, which with Union piofits of
about the same sum and $5000 a year
from other sources will reach the re
quired sum.
