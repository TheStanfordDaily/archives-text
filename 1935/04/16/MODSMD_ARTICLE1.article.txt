Flatly turning against the wishes of
Governor Frank F. Merriam, Cali
fornia's Senate today put a decisive
foot down on the governor's appoint
ment of John C. Porter, former Los
Angeles mayor, to the State Per
sonnel Board.
Senator Leads Battle
The battle against Porter was led
hy Senator Stow, Santa Barbara, and
it. quickly developed into a series of
fiery exchanges in which charges of
'"rubber stamps for the governor,"
"needless besmirching of a man's
character," "intolerance," and "ex
aggerated statements made under the
protection of Senate privilege," flew
back and forth.
The climax was provided when
Senator Scollan, Sacramento, near
the close of the debate, arose and
demanded to know whether "your
loyalty is going to he given to the
governor or the Slate of Califor
nia?"
The Santa Barbara senator, who
previously had charged Porter with
being "no man for the personnel
job" because of his alleged refusal
to drink a wine toast to the Presi
dent of France and because of his
failure to greet President Roosevelt
On Oil official visit to Los Angeles,
said ne wa.s willing to waive these
two incidents.
Instead, he asserted his belief
that Porter, if appointed to the
Personnel Board, would crucify"
state employees because of his
"intolerance."
He asserted further that Porter
had allowed big Los Angeles
gambling establishments to run
"high, wide and handsome" while
(he little ones were closed down.

find another man to fill the person
nel board vacancy, refused 1o com
ment on the action of the Senate in
