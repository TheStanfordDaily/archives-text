# Bridges Ousted for Conservative Leader
## O'Grady Named Temporary Head of Marine Unions 
### 
SEATTLE, April 15 (A').—Harry
Bridges, militant longshore chief of
San Francisco, who led in the strike
last summer, was shoved aside today
in the marine convention which con
servatives dominated by electing
E. B. O'Grady, San Francisco, as
temporary chairman.
The meeting may last a week, may
result in a general strike, may ap
prove the present oil tankers strike,
j may advocate peace, may do nothing
but accomplish its ostensible pur
pose, formation of a central marine
federation. Union leaders refused to
discuss their plans—some said they
didn't know them.
i Unions represented were the In
j ternational Longshoremen's Union,
i International Seaman's Union, Mas
! ters, Mates and Pilots, American
| Radio Telegraphers Association and
i the Marine Engineers' Beneficial
Association.
First sessions saw a quiet group
| of between 125 and 200 conservatives,
| mostly concerned today over prox-
I ies and credentials. All delegates
j are from unions affiliated with the
| American Federation of Labor.
