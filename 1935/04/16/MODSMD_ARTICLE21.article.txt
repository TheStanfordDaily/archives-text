LONDON, April 15 (/I').—Neville
Chamberlain, chancellor of the ex
chequer, pulled his fourth balanced
budget out of the counting house to
day, offering new relief to millions
of small taxpayers despite increased
military expenditures for 1935-36 of
about $52,300,000.
He proposed to Commons the in
come tax be reduced in the lower
brackets and announced restoration
of the final portion of pay cuts made
in 1931. Even so he presented an
estimated surplus for the year of
500,000—about $2,425,000.
Describes Program
'Our program of cheap money,
tariffs, remission of taxes and bal
anced budgets," said the chancellor,
"has made it possible for our coun
try to recover 80 per cent of its pros
perity. Given peace abroad and fair
time at home we should make a fur
ther substantial advance in the com
ing fiscal year."
The chancellor's total estimated
expenditure of £729,970,000 (about
$3,649,800,000) compares with 708,-
879,171 pounds for last year, while
the total estimated revenue of £735,-
580,000 ($3,677,81*0,000) was an ap
preciable jump over the last budget's
716,441,050 pounds.
No War Debt
Chamberlain painted a glowing
picture of increased production in
industry and increased trade, but
warned: "We will need constant ef
fort to maintain what has been
achieved."
His budget contains no provision
again this year for payment of the
war debt now owed to the United
States, listed in Chamberlain's offi
cial debt ledger at $4,368,000,000.
