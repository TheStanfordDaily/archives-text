in which she has established her rep
utation as a critic and a patron,
Gertrude Stein will again appear on
the campus tomorrow night at 8
o'clock in the Dance Studio of the
Roble Gym.
Although she is American-born,
Miss Stein has spent much of her
life in Paris, where she has been
associated with many of the best
known figures in contemporary art.
Her studio in Paris has been the
gathering place for artists of all na
tionalities. Miss Stein has done much
to bring the works of once unrecog
nized geniuses to public attention.
Together with her fame in the field
of art, Miss Stein has gained world
wide reknown for her distinctive
style of writing. Her main purpose
has been to adapt her style to her
subject matter.
Coming to Stanford under the aus
pices of the English Club, Miss Stein
makes her second appearance on the
Stanford campus this year. The au
dience will be limited to 300.
Tickets for the lecture arc 50 cents, i
