# NO SIGNS ON TREES Quad Sales to Continue PUBLICITY RESTRUNG
## 
### 
"No signs on campus trees or
telephone poles" orders university
regulations, and they're O.K. by the
gentleman who will vend the 1935
Quad outside the post office today.
Once before he outwitted collegiate
Blackstone's ordinance, and he's not
beaten yet.
Students will remember his trick
overhead poster set-up of a week
ago, when he suspended cards from
a wire stretched between the street
sign and stop sign at the intersection
of Santa Teresa and Lasuen Streets.
This Tuesday he is afraid some
legal whip might invoke the aid of
a technicality, and to stop all com
ers he is planning the erection of
tko old coat-hangers mounted on
tables.
"I'll string my publicity from
them," he announced.
