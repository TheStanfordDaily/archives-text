# GREEKS' BOARD HOPES FOR END OF HELL WEEK
## Interfraternity Group Will Seek Action of Houses, Regulate Abuses MOVE WELL RECEIVED Action Taken on Findings Of Exhaustive Survey 
### Frank Orr 
Excessive initiation practices, con
sidered by many detrimental to the
health and scholarship of the pledge
and the reputation of the chapter
and University, may go into the dis
card by a joint resolution of campus
fraternities.
Members of the Intel-fraternity
Board of Control, acting after a thor
ough survey of the effects of "Hell
Week" on sophomores, began last
night to present statistics to living
group. - ? and ask endorsement of the
new plan.
Formal Action Planned
If a large majority of the houses
approve the findings of the board's
initiation committee, then formal
action will be taken outlawing va
rious practices which are considered
harmful.
A noticeable drop in scholar
ship of first quarter sophomores
was indicated in a report given
â€¢he committee by the University's
scholarship committee. The drop
was noticeable only in the ease* of
fraternity pledges, indicating that
fall quarter initiations tended to
add to the already low scholar
ship averages of fraternity men.
Testimony by several initiates
also showed that lack of sleep and
physical strain aggravated this
condition.
Complaints, filed with the admin
istration by householders as far
away as Santa Cruz, periodically in
dicate that fraternity men on
"quests" are required to "borrow"
property and bother residents late at
night.
Examples Cited
Cases in other universities where
initiates have been seriously in
jured and even killed during "Hell
Week" practices were cited as illus
trations of what an uncontrolled sys
tem of initiation might result in.
No definite regulations will be
imposed. However, the objective is
expoctcd to be attained by joint res
olution, defining what practices may
be used and which will be consid
ered outside the pale of reason.
Several houses took definite ac
tion endorsing the move last night,
and there was a strong indication
that most of the others would vote
favorably. Many fraternities at
the present time operate under na
tional and local rules which pro
hibit conspicuous, extreme, or
harmful activities.
