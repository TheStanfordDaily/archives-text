# Hell Week Practices at Stanford Appear Doomed
## 
### 
Sleepy-eyed pledges fail examinations, com
plaining that fraternity initiations have pre
vented their studying and deprived them of
rest. Householders complain ol stolen ani
mals and defaced property. Six per cent ol
Stanford fraternity pledges appear at the
11 e a 1111 Service during or after "Hell Week"
in need of medical attention.
This is the situation as it exists under the
present jumhle of initiation practices which
exist here. Some fraternities, already under
local and national rules controlling treatment
(jf pledges, are reasonable in their activities;
others permit practices which injure the
health and scholarship of the pledge, submit
ting him to danger of injury, as well as lower
the reputation of the t'niversity and his chap
ter.
The Interfraternity Hoard, in a quiet, sen
sible manner, is presenting the facts of the
matter to the fraternities, and it seems likely
that Stanford will follow the lead of other
progressive American universities in outlaw
ing certain practices which have resulted dis
aslrouslv elsewhere.
Last year there was a great to-do about
the fact that "Hell Week" had been abolished.
The eU'ect of that move was merely to change
the name to "pre-initiation period," require
registration of all initiation period dates, and
frown on excessive practices.
A much farther-reaching and objective view
is taken by the Hoard in its move at the present
time. Initiative in the matter has been taken
by the fraternity men themselves, and it is
probable that a satisfactory solution will be
reached without any necessity of an edict from
the dean's or president's office.
