preliminaries leading up to it serve a useful
purpose. Foremost is the fact that the pennies,
later nickels, and finally dollars which drop
into the eoll'ers of the contest committee, go to
the Convalescent Home and they are contribu

Secondly, all the atmosphere and color sur
rounding this contest go to make up a tradi

on the Farm, and is Stanford's one exception
to otherwise conservative I 'diversity dances.
Many of the candidates sport fancy appella

strength of their poeketbooks, or depend on
the fact that because Susie goes out with Hill,
the other boys in the house (Cod bless them!)
will part with some of their monthly allow

of fame.
In older days on the campus, a few houses
shared their kings and queens between them
in proper order of rotation. No more so. The
Hall, with added strength, stands ready to
challenge any and all candidates, and with
the campus goal as a substantial amount to
the Convalescent Home, may the voles llv
