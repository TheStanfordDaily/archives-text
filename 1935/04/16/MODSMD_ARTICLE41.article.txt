# Study or Sleep in the Libe?
## 
### 
l'or seven days Inst week hundreds «l' sln
denls trudged up the lliirly-lhree slops lend
ing from the main floor of the t'niversity
library to the reference or periodical rooms
on the second lloor to do some required study
ing.
Those same hundreds settled down in a
slufl'y, hadlv ventilated room where the tem
perature from Monday to Friday failed to
drop below 72 degrees Fahrenheit between
<S and 1(1 o'clock during any of the nights.
It was as if those students were entering a
hot-house with the expectation of doing a
night's studying.
Instead of perusing the books properly,
most students became drowsy and often am
bled down the thirty-three steps to the cool,
Iresh air outside. Thev dreamed and thought
of a more comfortable atmosphere. The usual
number, drowsy with the heat, put their heads
on folded arms and tried to go to sleep.
According to tested and satisfactorily
proved figures, the temperature should slay
at (».H degrees Fahrenheit with a relatively high
humidity. The thermometer, however, has
hovered between 72 .and 74 degrees.
In an "enlightened" institution like Stan
lord. it seems paradoxical that so little atten
tion should be paid to the temperature of the
main librarv.
