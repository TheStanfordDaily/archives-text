# THE 						SETTING
## 
### 
Before considering the matter at hand, and lest we
make the same mistake as correspondents did at the
time, it will be necessary to present some of the back
ground and facts preceding the armed conflict.
Such material, though presented at the risk of bor
ing the reader, is vital to an unprejudiced under
standing of this incident—or any other. Conspicuously
absent in press dispatches of January, 1932, the points
we are about to consider were lost in the shuffle for
sensational "spot news."
Of paramount importance was the boycott, which
was of sufficient motivation to the incident to gladden
the heart of any economic determinist. The first Chi
nese-invoked boycott was against the United States in
1905, which Roosevelt I promptly "big-sticked" into a
nonentity. From that time on, anti-Japanese boycotts
were organized almost biennially in China. In 1925,
Russian Communists momentarily directed the Chinese
into boycotting the British.
Like most boycotts, the Chinese ones usually petered
out after the first wave of resentment passed. Canny,
the Chinese would soon be buying in the cheapest
market. But the 1931 boycott was no ordinary penny
ante affair. The Chinese introduced first-class racket
eering methods into the game.
Led by associations with headquarters in the
Shanghai foreign settlement, the boycott built it
self a war chest from stiff fines imposed on mer
chants found with Japanese goods, and also from
resales of confiscated goods. The war chest was
then used to hire huskies to see to it that Japj:,-
lese goods were not bought. Municipal, govern
mental, and Kuoinintang (controlling party) offi
cials were members of these extra-legal societies.
Japan looked on confiscations of goods as little
better than robbery and, obviously, liked the rest
of the movement equally little.
The Manchurian occupation in the fall of 1931 added
fuel to the flames of the boycott already invoked be
cause the Chinese felt the Japanese had tarried in
suppressing the anti-Chinese riots in Korea caused
by reports of Chinese atrocities against Koreans in
Manchuria.
The British paper in Shanghai, North China Daily
News, as well as responsible and well-informed resi
dents, foresaw trouble if the associations remained in
operation. Meanwhile, great numbers of the 30,000
Japanese merchants in the city returned home, ruined.
The highly literate Japanese public, great readers,
I soon knew of this condition.
j However, the American public, less vitally inter
i ested, had no inkling of the graveness of the situation.
Correspondents, knowing that the latest murder trial
1 (Massie, at the moment) held more interest than any
! thing which had yet developed in Shanghai, saved
their papers the expense of cable tolls and told them
| nothing. Scarcely a paper besides the Nov/ York
| Times was informed at all.
On the 19th of January, for example, about the
only news of the Far East that the Associated
Press carried was a short note to the effect that ;
i some "foreign office spokesman" (meaning just
what?) had branded recent Japanese replies to
Secretary Stimson's note "insulting to China" and
"impertinent to America." (Not that the Chinese
would foster an ;»nti-Japanese feeling in this coun
try!)
The "incident," so necessary to international
; maneuvers, occurred on the 20th. Two Buddhist
| priests and several Japanese civilians were attacked,
i and one of the priests died. A brief paragraph by
A.P., which was carried in the back pages by most
i papers, said: "Chinese police and a number of Japa
: nese clashed" in the settlement "and one Japanese was
I killed."
For three days no mention of Shanghai could be
) found in most papers. On the 23rd, another small
I article told of forthcoming "drastic naval action" un
j less satisfaction in accordance with the ultimatums
was received. No explanation of what the ultimatums
J wanted or why was included. The article ended by
! saying Japanese warships steamed in as the funeral for
the Japanese killed in Wednesday's riots progressed.
(This was Saturday.)
The 25th brought news that "the threatened occu
j pation of Shanghai by Japanese marines was post
| poned" by a two-hour conference between the mayor
I and Japan's consul-general.
The articles were given small "play" by most Amer
ican papers and most readers were unaware that any
' thing was happening.
It was during this week that the Municipal Council
i of Shanghai (an international body) declared the city
i to be in a state of emergency due mainly to the large
number of Chinese fleeing into the settlement in fear
of their own 19th P'oute Army. No mention of this ever
reached American papers.
With an apology for the length of these neces
sary preliminaries, this article closes. Tomorrow,
we shall see how the original Japanese troop
movements were part of the INTERNATIONAL
DEFENSE of the city and note a few more points
our newshawks neglected to tell us.

The highly literate Japanese public, great readers,
I soon knew of this condition.
j However, the American public, less vitally inter
i ested, had no inkling of the graveness of the situation.
Correspondents, knowing that the latest murder trial
1 (Massie, at the moment) held more interest than any
! thing which had yet developed in Shanghai, saved
their papers the expense of cable tolls and told them
| nothing. Scarcely a paper besides the Nov/ York
| Times was informed at all.
On the 19th of January, for example, about the
only news of the Far East that the Associated
Press carried was a short note to the effect that ;
i some "foreign office spokesman" (meaning just
what?) had branded recent Japanese replies to
Secretary Stimson's note "insulting to China" and
"impertinent to America." (Not that the Chinese
would foster an ;»nti-Japanese feeling in this coun
try!)
The "incident," so necessary to international
; maneuvers, occurred on the 20th. Two Buddhist
| priests and several Japanese civilians were attacked,
i and one of the priests died. A brief paragraph by
A.P., which was carried in the back pages by most
i papers, said: "Chinese police and a number of Japa
: nese clashed" in the settlement "and one Japanese was
I killed."
For three days no mention of Shanghai could be
) found in most papers. On the 23rd, another small
I article told of forthcoming "drastic naval action" un
j less satisfaction in accordance with the ultimatums
was received. No explanation of what the ultimatums
J wanted or why was included. The article ended by
! saying Japanese warships steamed in as the funeral for
the Japanese killed in Wednesday's riots progressed.
(This was Saturday.)
The 25th brought news that "the threatened occu
j pation of Shanghai by Japanese marines was post
| poned" by a two-hour conference between the mayor
I and Japan's consul-general.
The articles were given small "play" by most Amer
ican papers and most readers were unaware that any
' thing was happening.
It was during this week that the Municipal Council
i of Shanghai (an international body) declared the city
i to be in a state of emergency due mainly to the large
number of Chinese fleeing into the settlement in fear
of their own 19th P'oute Army. No mention of this ever
reached American papers.
With an apology for the length of these neces
sary preliminaries, this article closes. Tomorrow,
we shall see how the original Japanese troop
movements were part of the INTERNATIONAL
DEFENSE of the city and note a few more points
our newshawks neglected to tell us.
Before considering the matter at hand, and lest we
make the same mistake as correspondents did at the
time, it will be necessary to present some of the back
ground and facts preceding the armed conflict.
Such material, though presented at the risk of bor
ing the reader, is vital to an unprejudiced under
standing of this incident—or any other. Conspicuously
absent in press dispatches of January, 1932, the points
we are about to consider were lost in the shuffle for
sensational "spot news."
Of paramount importance was the boycott, which
was of sufficient motivation to the incident to gladden
the heart of any economic determinist. The first Chi
nese-invoked boycott was against the United States in
1905, which Roosevelt I promptly "big-sticked" into a
nonentity. From that time on, anti-Japanese boycotts
were organized almost biennially in China. In 1925,
Russian Communists momentarily directed the Chinese
into boycotting the British.
Like most boycotts, the Chinese ones usually petered
out after the first wave of resentment passed. Canny,
the Chinese would soon be buying in the cheapest
market. But the 1931 boycott was no ordinary penny
ante affair. The Chinese introduced first-class racket
eering methods into the game.
Led by associations with headquarters in the
Shanghai foreign settlement, the boycott built it
self a war chest from stiff fines imposed on mer
chants found with Japanese goods, and also from
resales of confiscated goods. The war chest was
then used to hire huskies to see to it that Japj:,-
lese goods were not bought. Municipal, govern
mental, and Kuoinintang (controlling party) offi
cials were members of these extra-legal societies.
Japan looked on confiscations of goods as little
better than robbery and, obviously, liked the rest
of the movement equally little.
The Manchurian occupation in the fall of 1931 added
fuel to the flames of the boycott already invoked be
cause the Chinese felt the Japanese had tarried in
suppressing the anti-Chinese riots in Korea caused
by reports of Chinese atrocities against Koreans in
Manchuria.
The British paper in Shanghai, North China Daily
News, as well as responsible and well-informed resi
dents, foresaw trouble if the associations remained in
operation. Meanwhile, great numbers of the 30,000
Japanese merchants in the city returned home, ruined.

of their own 19th P'oute Army. No mention of this ever
reached American papers.
With an apology for the length of these neces
sary preliminaries, this article closes. Tomorrow,
we shall see how the original Japanese troop
movements were part of the INTERNATIONAL
DEFENSE of the city and note a few more points
our newshawks neglected to tell us.
Before considering the matter at hand, and lest we
make the same mistake as correspondents did at the
time, it will be necessary to present some of the back
ground and facts preceding the armed conflict.
Such material, though presented at the risk of bor
ing the reader, is vital to an unprejudiced under
standing of this incident—or any other. Conspicuously
absent in press dispatches of January, 1932, the points
we are about to consider were lost in the shuffle for
sensational "spot news."
Of paramount importance was the boycott, which
was of sufficient motivation to the incident to gladden
the heart of any economic determinist. The first Chi
nese-invoked boycott was against the United States in
1905, which Roosevelt I promptly "big-sticked" into a
nonentity. From that time on, anti-Japanese boycotts
were organized almost biennially in China. In 1925,
Russian Communists momentarily directed the Chinese
into boycotting the British.
Like most boycotts, the Chinese ones usually petered
out after the first wave of resentment passed. Canny,
the Chinese would soon be buying in the cheapest
market. But the 1931 boycott was no ordinary penny
ante affair. The Chinese introduced first-class racket
eering methods into the game.
Led by associations with headquarters in the
Shanghai foreign settlement, the boycott built it
self a war chest from stiff fines imposed on mer
chants found with Japanese goods, and also from
resales of confiscated goods. The war chest was
then used to hire huskies to see to it that Japj:,-
lese goods were not bought. Municipal, govern
mental, and Kuoinintang (controlling party) offi
cials were members of these extra-legal societies.
Japan looked on confiscations of goods as little
better than robbery and, obviously, liked the rest
of the movement equally little.
The Manchurian occupation in the fall of 1931 added
fuel to the flames of the boycott already invoked be
cause the Chinese felt the Japanese had tarried in
suppressing the anti-Chinese riots in Korea caused
by reports of Chinese atrocities against Koreans in
Manchuria.
The British paper in Shanghai, North China Daily
News, as well as responsible and well-informed resi
dents, foresaw trouble if the associations remained in
operation. Meanwhile, great numbers of the 30,000
Japanese merchants in the city returned home, ruined.
The highly literate Japanese public, great readers,
I soon knew of this condition.
j However, the American public, less vitally inter
i ested, had no inkling of the graveness of the situation.
Correspondents, knowing that the latest murder trial
1 (Massie, at the moment) held more interest than any
! thing which had yet developed in Shanghai, saved
their papers the expense of cable tolls and told them
| nothing. Scarcely a paper besides the Nov/ York
| Times was informed at all.
On the 19th of January, for example, about the
only news of the Far East that the Associated
Press carried was a short note to the effect that ;
i some "foreign office spokesman" (meaning just
what?) had branded recent Japanese replies to
Secretary Stimson's note "insulting to China" and
"impertinent to America." (Not that the Chinese
would foster an ;»nti-Japanese feeling in this coun
try!)
The "incident," so necessary to international
; maneuvers, occurred on the 20th. Two Buddhist
| priests and several Japanese civilians were attacked,
i and one of the priests died. A brief paragraph by
A.P., which was carried in the back pages by most
i papers, said: "Chinese police and a number of Japa
: nese clashed" in the settlement "and one Japanese was
I killed."
For three days no mention of Shanghai could be
) found in most papers. On the 23rd, another small
I article told of forthcoming "drastic naval action" un
j less satisfaction in accordance with the ultimatums
was received. No explanation of what the ultimatums
J wanted or why was included. The article ended by
! saying Japanese warships steamed in as the funeral for
the Japanese killed in Wednesday's riots progressed.
(This was Saturday.)
The 25th brought news that "the threatened occu
j pation of Shanghai by Japanese marines was post
| poned" by a two-hour conference between the mayor
I and Japan's consul-general.
The articles were given small "play" by most Amer
ican papers and most readers were unaware that any
' thing was happening.
It was during this week that the Municipal Council
i of Shanghai (an international body) declared the city
i to be in a state of emergency due mainly to the large
number of Chinese fleeing into the settlement in fear
of their own 19th P'oute Army. No mention of this ever
reached American papers.
