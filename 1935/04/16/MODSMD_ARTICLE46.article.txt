# BULL SESSION
## WHAT GOOD DOES A COLLEGE EDUCATION? 
### 
Editor's Note: This Bull Ses
sion does not represent the opin
ion of The Stanford Daily, hut es
sentially that of the columnist.
The editorial in controversy ap
peared in the Saturday issue of
tiic San Francisco Examiner.
That is an old, old question. And
one that has been rehashed more
often than Union stew. But like
Union stew, the question simply can
not be gotten rid of.
Almost everyone is ready to ad
mit that college men and women
waste the better part of their uni
versity careers—so far as things in
tellectual are concerned. Yet there
are some who stiil believe that col
lege has its points. What if college
students do diddle away the shining
hours which we are told the busy
bee doth improve? The college stu
dent at least gains a respect for
knowledge; he at least learns the
value of "objectivity," the need for
the search after truth.—Or so the ar
gument runs . . .
In attempting to get at the heart
of the good-of-college question,
nothing is more informative than
case histories. This morning we have
such a case history.
Stanley Beaubaire, remembered
as one-time head of the Rally Com
mittee and also as editor of The
Stanford Daily, has just broken into
print in the house that Jack built—
the San Francisco Examiner. To
those who followed Mr. Beaubaire's
Hearst-baiting editorial policy, it is
not to wonder that the Sage of Stan

[ ford now speaks in unison with the
Sage of San Simeon. Mr. Beaubaire
was always a seeker after the truth.
i, Stanley's latest quest fur knowl
edge has led him to burst forth in
Hearstian splendor with an attack
lon the "nation - wide anti-war
i strike." Significant in the perform
ance ,is not the subject of the dia
tribe itself, but rather the peculiar
j mode of assault. "
As Mr. Beaubaire wrote, his heart
! thrilled to the shriek and roar of
j the animals that roam San Simeon.
The eagle screamed—and into the
editorial came trooping the words
| "revolution," "radical," and "in
i sidious." The lion roared—and in
i came the capital letters. And then
| a more subtle noise, a soft whisper
| ing in Mr. Beaubaire's ear, and the
1 Stanford student forgot all his ob
! jectivity.
j This is not written in condemna
j tion of Mr. Beaubaire. When Mr.
Beaubaire used to write things for
! The Stanford Daily he used to talk
;of "objectivity," "the search for
' truth," and "seeing both sides of
I every question." But Mr. Beaubaire
has faced the giants of the outside
j world. And naturally, the giants of
! the outside world have been far
| more powerful than the pigmy
i thoughts of "objectivity" and "seeing
! both sides of every question." And
! so, the Hearst-Beaubaire editorial.
| What good does a college educa
l tion? It may help one Stanford stu
dent to get a job.
