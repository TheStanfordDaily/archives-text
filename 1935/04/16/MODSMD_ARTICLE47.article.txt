# BEAUBAIRE REPLIES TO BULL SESSION
## 
### 
Mr. David Mellinkoff, as Mellin- j
koffs are wont to do, is cn the war- I
path. He dislikes animals. He re- !
sents capital letters. He is opposed j
to the ideas of this Beaubaire per- j
son. He is opposed to many things, j
In the Bull Session he attacks a i
signed editorial comment which ap- j
peared in the Hearst newspapers
last Saturday. He disagrees not with
the content of the editorial so much
os with the style of its presentation. I
Many persons did not agree with
Mr. Mellinkoff that the student's i
anti-war strike of last week was a i
good thing. Many would say that it
was foolish, unnecessary, and de
signed to bring too much unfavor- |
able metropolitan publicity to the
American campus.
Mr. Mellinkoff talks of "objectiv
ity" and a "seaxx-h for truth."
In his own politely emphatic
comment, Mr. Mellinkoff, speaking
always of the downfall and degrada
tion of this fellow Beaubaire, speaks
not of what he wrote, but of what
Mr. Mellinkoff ascribes as the motive
for the writing. One is not told why
or what but one is given sentences
I that travel in circles.

The article to which Mr. Mel
linkofT refers is easily explained.
It states that the anti-war strike
was unnecessary, that it was the
work of groups (not on the Stanford
campus) who are thinking of more
than a mere protest against war in
stirring up feeling in the universi
ties.
It declared lhat its author was op
posed to war, sought peace, btit did
not think that classes must be cut,
or a general strike called, to attend
meetings that could have been held
as are the Stanford Walrus Club
forums, after school hours, for all
who are interested to attend.
It advanced the opinion that a
strike of students, aside from caus
ing many intelligent people to
laugh at college life, would bring
no constructive gain, and would
cause thinking people to treat the
college men and women as babies
to be nursed.
At Stanford there was no such
strike, and peace discussions were
held, centering in the assembly
which Dr. Wilbur arranged. Mr.
Mellinkoff, the so-called "Dove of
Peace," spoke there and did not
consider himself on strike.
The articles to which Mr. Mellin
koff had reference said we should
act to prevent war by not seeking
war, that we should seek out edu
cation and knowledge for this pur

! pose.
That is OBJECTIVITY, if Mr.
! Mellinkoff would see it. That is seek
! ing out the truth, not talking in
j specious diatribes as does today's
j Bull Session.
I do not know Mr. Mellinkoff's
I motives in ascribing reasons for my
' so-called connection with the Hearst
' newspapers. Where his unwar
| ranted assumptions cf my actions
I and my connections are found I do
! not pretend to know. I should not
i dare suppose that he used his imag
i ination, for that would not be cour
teous, and Mr. Mellinkoff is a gentle
man.
i As for the original article, it
j stands where it cannot be erased,
written at the request of the pub
i lisher of the papers in which it ap
! pears. For any connection that it
might have had with the name of
Stanford, if I have brought shame
I to that name, I am truly sorry.
■j As for my belief that the general
strike was needless and out of place,
'ii. stands, to be reiterated.

Mr. David Mellinkoff, as Mellin- j

In the Bull Session he attacks a i
signed editorial comment which ap- j
peared in the Hearst newspapers
last Saturday. He disagrees not with
the content of the editorial so much
os with the style of its presentation. I
Many persons did not agree with
Mr. Mellinkoff that the student's i
anti-war strike of last week was a i
good thing. Many would say that it
was foolish, unnecessary, and de
signed to bring too much unfavor- |
able metropolitan publicity to the
American campus.
Mr. Mellinkoff talks of "objectiv
ity" and a "seaxx-h for truth."
In his own politely emphatic
comment, Mr. Mellinkoff, speaking
always of the downfall and degrada
tion of this fellow Beaubaire, speaks
not of what he wrote, but of what
Mr. Mellinkoff ascribes as the motive
for the writing. One is not told why
or what but one is given sentences
I that travel in circles.

The article to which Mr. Mel
linkofT refers is easily explained.
It states that the anti-war strike
was unnecessary, that it was the
work of groups (not on the Stanford
campus) who are thinking of more
than a mere protest against war in
stirring up feeling in the universi
ties.
It declared lhat its author was op
posed to war, sought peace, btit did
not think that classes must be cut,
or a general strike called, to attend
meetings that could have been held
as are the Stanford Walrus Club
forums, after school hours, for all
who are interested to attend.
It advanced the opinion that a
strike of students, aside from caus
ing many intelligent people to
laugh at college life, would bring
no constructive gain, and would
cause thinking people to treat the
college men and women as babies
to be nursed.
At Stanford there was no such
strike, and peace discussions were
held, centering in the assembly
which Dr. Wilbur arranged. Mr.
Mellinkoff, the so-called "Dove of
Peace," spoke there and did not
consider himself on strike.
