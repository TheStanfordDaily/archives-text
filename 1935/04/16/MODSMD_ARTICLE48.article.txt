WEST POINT OF THE AIR"
! At the Stanford Theater v
j "West Point of the Air" is melo-
I dramatic hodge-podge, but I must
| confess, a little shamefacedly, that I
; enjoyed it down to the very last
I crash. As an exciting drama of the
air it fills the
bill.
Filmed at
Randolph* Field,
Texas, training
school for Uncle
Sam's aviation
corps, the pic-
I ture tells the
! story of "Big Mike" Stone (Wallace
! Beery) instructor at the school, and
I his son, "Little Mike" (Robert
, Young), a West Point graduate who
|is learning to fly. Beery and Young
| suffer and suffer, and it is all very
enjoyable. â€”B. Sweet
