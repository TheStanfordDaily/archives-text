WAR vs. CIVILIZATION
The Editor, Sir:
War is Uppermost in the thought '
of the world today. Talk is reaching !
the incendiary stage. Friday's as- j
sembly provoked a whirl-wind of i
comment. Unfortunately the prob- j
lem which seemed to consume the I
.speakers was the question of how !
the Stanford student could keep the
United States out of the impending
war and, thereby, himself. Four
speakers discussed the problem
from important angles, and Presi
dent Wilbur concluded the session '
by quietly reminding us that he had j
watched Stanford go to war twice I
and that when she had decided to
go to war that she had gone like
MEN and WOMEN.
If we are to stay out of war there
are doubtless many steps which can |
be taken to promote harmony among
nations, but all the steps in the world
will not eliminate war until one I
basic decision is made. When, and <
only when, we can find the courage ,
to submit 100 per cent to an adver- j
sary and resolve to do this in the t
face oi any opposing militant cause, j
can we hope to stay out of war. i
. . . Cowardice! Treason! It may be,
but the alternative is the destruc

i tion of civilization (if there are any
; who have forgotten how humane
! this is, read All Quiet on the West
ern Front, by Erich Maria Re
marque).
From 1914 to 1919 a war was fought
jto the bitter endâ€”a war to end all
j war and make the world safe for j
! Democracy. Today, Democracy is
vanishing; and the world is again on
the brink of mass murder. The
fundamental problem isn't how are
we going to stay out of war, but, will
and can we instill into ourselves the
great truth that we must either un
reservedly renounce war or pre
pare to take up arms again in the
name of our sacred and patriotic
duty.
Sincerely,
Boyd White
