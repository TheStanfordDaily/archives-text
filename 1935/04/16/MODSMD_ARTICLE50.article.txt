GREAT BUILD-UP \
FOR BIG MEET

Providing that the monsoons per
mit the actual holding of the meet,
the build-up for the 1935 Rig Meet
will be well-nigh perfect from the
.standpoint of spectator interest.
The J.vck of interest in Big Meets
of the past has been due to the
certainty of the outcome: Stanford
was so far stronger than Califor
nia that the only interest in the
score that could be moused was
whether or not the Indians would
score 100 points.
Brutus Hamilton remedied that
with a flourish this spring. He pro
vided a strenuous schedule, a color
ful list of opponents, and succeeded
in developing a team which was
humbled only by the mighty Troy.
He has a group of high class track
and field men and about them he has
/juilt up a strong following in the
East Bay.
Hamilton did so well that the bal
ance swung the other way. The Bears
exceeded all expectations and Stan
ford, defeated and rained out, had
n't made a show. The Big Meet
seemed to bo in the bag for the
Bears. To the average fan there was
no more uncertainty in the outcome
than (here had been before.

SWING UP SATURDAY

FIRST REPORTS ON
DOPE SHEET CONTEST

That was before last Saturday.
Then the Indians came out of their
wraps and California suffered one
hard blow. Stanford's champions of
last year showed that they would be
champions again this yeai* and a
number of unknowns came through
with the goods. If Mushy Pollock,
slated for six points in the sprints
and live in the broad jump is really
out of the Big Meet, California, not
the Indians, will be the team that
must come through to win.
The Pollock injury seemed slight
at the time of its occurrence, so
slight that this writer is largely un
impressed by the scare that the U.C.
ace will not be on hand Saturday.
After his close third in the 100-
yard dash. Pollock came over to
the jump pit. Ilis first jump
gave him third place. On his sec
ond he left the take-off per usual,
hut didn't get any height into his
jump, and flopped over into the
sand about 15 feet out. He got up
limping, as though he might have
hurt his taped ankle, hut he did
not seem lo be conscious of a
muscle injury. Assistant Coach A1
Regan told him to quit for the
day, hut in such a casual way th,it
thej consequent newspaper flurry
seems hardly justified.

Farm track nuts have a hardy be
lief in the magic of Coach Dink Tem
pleton and the come-through quali
ties of the Indian track team, for the
preliminary entries of the Big Meet
Dope Sheet Contest, with one ex
ception, are contrary to outside sen

mit the actual holding of the meet,
the build-up for the 1935 Rig Meet
will be well-nigh perfect from the
.standpoint of spectator interest.
The J.vck of interest in Big Meets
of the past has been due to the
certainty of the outcome: Stanford
was so far stronger than Califor
nia that the only interest in the
score that could be moused was
whether or not the Indians would
score 100 points.
Brutus Hamilton remedied that
with a flourish this spring. He pro
vided a strenuous schedule, a color
ful list of opponents, and succeeded
in developing a team which was
humbled only by the mighty Troy.
He has a group of high class track
and field men and about them he has
/juilt up a strong following in the
East Bay.
Hamilton did so well that the bal
ance swung the other way. The Bears
exceeded all expectations and Stan
ford, defeated and rained out, had
n't made a show. The Big Meet
seemed to bo in the bag for the
Bears. To the average fan there was
no more uncertainty in the outcome
than (here had been before.

SWING UP SATURDAY

FIRST REPORTS ON
DOPE SHEET CONTEST

That was before last Saturday.
Then the Indians came out of their
wraps and California suffered one
hard blow. Stanford's champions of
last year showed that they would be
champions again this yeai* and a
number of unknowns came through
with the goods. If Mushy Pollock,
slated for six points in the sprints
and live in the broad jump is really
out of the Big Meet, California, not
the Indians, will be the team that
must come through to win.
The Pollock injury seemed slight
at the time of its occurrence, so
slight that this writer is largely un
impressed by the scare that the U.C.
ace will not be on hand Saturday.
After his close third in the 100-
yard dash. Pollock came over to
the jump pit. Ilis first jump
gave him third place. On his sec
ond he left the take-off per usual,
hut didn't get any height into his
jump, and flopped over into the
sand about 15 feet out. He got up
limping, as though he might have
hurt his taped ankle, hut he did
not seem lo be conscious of a
muscle injury. Assistant Coach A1
Regan told him to quit for the
day, hut in such a casual way th,it
thej consequent newspaper flurry
seems hardly justified.

Farm track nuts have a hardy be
lief in the magic of Coach Dink Tem
pleton and the come-through quali
ties of the Indian track team, for the
preliminary entries of the Big Meet
Dope Sheet Contest, with one ex
ception, are contrary to outside sen
timent and slate another win for
Stanford. Here are their final scores:
