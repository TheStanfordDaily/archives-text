# New Big Meet Dope Boosts Card Morale
## HOPES OF VICTORY RISE IN STUDY OF RECENT RESULTS Indians Will Work Out At Berkeley Field Today 
### Warren Breed 
In order that the field event
| men may get used to the take
j ofTs and circles for Saturday's Big
I Meet, the Stanford track varsity
I will hold its workout in the Isir of
the Bear, Edwards oval in Berke-
J ley, Ibis afternoon, leaving the
i Farm about 1 o'clock.
It was reported last night that
Humbert Smith, Stanford's high
jump hope for the Big Meet,
strained his take-off ankle in prac
tice yesterday afternoon. Doctors
declared that the injury was not
serious but it was feared that the
strain might reduce Smith's chanc
es Saturday.

| Came the week-end, and with it
j came momentous happy changes in
j the standing of the Cards and the
! Bears one week before the Big Meet.
In the space of less than two hours
| Saturday Dink Templeton's Stan
; ford defending national champions
I came from utter hopelessness to a
' position that threatens Brutus Ham
ilton's Bears with defeat next Satur-
I day afternoon at Berkeley.
Bears Lose Star
! Just as the warm weather of the
i sunny southland brought out the
j Cards to surprising heights, a slight
| drizzle held Cal to not-too-good per
formances.
Adding to the dicomfiture of the
Bears is the news that Mushy Pol
! lock, their smiling little best broad
I jumper and second sprinter, has a
[sore leg muscle, acquired in the pit
Saturday. His possible absence from
I competition in the Big Meet may
I swerve 11 points over to the Card
side of the ledger, for he was doped
la second in both sprints and first in
1 the broad jump.
Whole Team Clicks
Down in the Coliseum something
j happened to the Indians, who were
j fed up on the "rain rain go away"
I game and craved the healing l-ays of
the sun. Came the sun and the boys
I came through.
Captain A1 Blackman and Sammy
i Klopstock led in honor-taking ac

and Hershey (yes, the whole darned
[squad) pushed aside the mental
r hazards and went merrily to town,
j much to the expense of Harry Trot
ter's Bruins.
Blackman Stars
Just as Blackman carried home the
bacon in beating Captain LuValle in
a dynamic 440, he carried home the
baton in a new meet relay record
of 3:14.5. He completely ran LuValle
into the ground in the quarter and
I then was clocked in 47.3 for his last
: relay lap, best time on the Coast this
| year.
j Klopstock's great pair of races, at
1 14.G and 23.6, insured the public that
j he is the same old national champ of
j last year and that Moore and Fish
! back of Berkeley will have to break
j American records to top his fighting
; speed. Saturday also saw the return
j of Hunt Kingsbury to successful in
j tercollegiate competition.
Squad in Shape
Reports from the Uclan meet are
'so replete with glad tidings that it is

strained his take-off ankle in prac

declared that the injury was not

In the space of less than two hours

I came from utter hopelessness to a

I day afternoon at Berkeley.
Bears Lose Star
! Just as the warm weather of the
i sunny southland brought out the
j Cards to surprising heights, a slight

formances.
Adding to the dicomfiture of the
Bears is the news that Mushy Pol
! lock, their smiling little best broad
I jumper and second sprinter, has a
[sore leg muscle, acquired in the pit
Saturday. His possible absence from
I competition in the Big Meet may
I swerve 11 points over to the Card
side of the ledger, for he was doped
la second in both sprints and first in
1 the broad jump.
Whole Team Clicks
Down in the Coliseum something
j happened to the Indians, who were
j fed up on the "rain rain go away"
I game and craved the healing l-ays of
the sun. Came the sun and the boys
I came through.

Just as Blackman carried home the
bacon in beating Captain LuValle in
a dynamic 440, he carried home the
baton in a new meet relay record
of 3:14.5. He completely ran LuValle
into the ground in the quarter and
I then was clocked in 47.3 for his last
: relay lap, best time on the Coast this
