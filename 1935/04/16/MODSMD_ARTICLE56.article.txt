Injuries, the dread of every track ;
coach, have hit the none too strong j
Stanford frosh cinder team just at
the time when full strength seems to
he most necessaxy and Coach Bill !
Ellington is duly worried. Friday '
afternoon on Angell Field the year
lings have their toughest tilt of the '<
season â€” the annual "Little Big
Meet" with California frosh.
Broad jumper and sprinter Leo
Madlem is the chief object of El
lington's concern. Madlem pulled a 1
muscle just before he broke the tape j
as anchor man of the relay last Sat- j
urday and has been favoring the in
jury since, failing to report for
practice yesterday afternoon.
Madlem was being counted upon
lo take a second or third in the
broad jump, third in the pole vault,
third in the century, and run anchor ,
in the relay. His loss may mean the
meet.
Miier John Dern also went on the
injured list Friday when he strained
(he arch of his foot near the end of
the four-lap event. Dern was ex
pected to run third in the mile and
second in the two-mile against the
Bear yearlings. Chances for his
competing Saturday are good.
Near La Virtud, Honduras, is a
"fountain of blood" whose liquid has
the appearance of real blood, and
even coagulates. i
