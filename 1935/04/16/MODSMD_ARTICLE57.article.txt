# NETMEN FAVORED TO DOWN U.C. IN THURSDAY BATTLE
## Victory Over Troy Assures Cards of Conference Championship 
### Roger Kimball 
Heavily favored to gain their sixth
straight victory and complete a per
fect Pacific Coast Conference season,
Stanford's varsity tennis players will
face California on the College Ave
nue courts in Berkeley at 2 o'clock
Thursday afternoon.
Saturday's 8-1 win over U.S.C. ex
tended the Indians' streak to five,
and assured them of the champion
ship, with the Trojans almost cer
tain of second place. Standings in
the Conference race are now as fol
lows:
Team W. L. Pet.
Stanford 5 0 1000
U.S.C 2 2 .500
California 2 3 .400
U.C.L.A. 0 4 .000
Cards Favored
Since U.S.C. conquered California
Friday, 5 matches to 4, winning all
three doubles matches, the Bears
should not give the Cardinals too
much trouble. California netmen
usually reach their peak games
against Stanford, however, and may
play much better tennis than they
showed while losing all nine matches
on the Farm courts six weeks ago.
Dick Bennett, Paul Newton, and
football-playing Perry Schwartz are
among the Golden Bears' leading
racket wielders. Newton trounced
Stanford's Bill Seward in the Indian-
Bear frosh matches last spring, and
Bennett barely lost to Ben Dey. In
their first 1935 meeting, Seward re
quired three sets to down Newton,
and Bennett, playing first singles,
gave Captain Sam Lee a hard fight.
Match Cancelled
Stanford's match with the Po
mona Tennis Club has been cancel
led, since the clubmen were unable
to maintain a team.
Indian and Bear frosh will tangle
in Berkeley at 10 o'clock Saturday
morning, but first the Card babes
must play Modesto Junior College.
The jaysee netsters are bringing five
singles players and two doubles
teams to the varsity courts at 1:30
o'clock Thursday afternoon.
