# Tnursday Set For Stanford, U.C. Ball Game
## Postponed Contest Will Be Played Here at 3: 15 
### Bob Leland 
j Originally scheduled as the first
I game of a double-header at Berkeley
! Saturday the postponed contest be
tween the varsity nines of Stanford
and California has been set for 3:15
o'clock Thursday at the Sunken Dia
! mond.
Coach Harry Wolter has not defi
nitely decided who will assume the
1 pitching burden, but it will likely
i be one or the other of the Indian co-
I captains, Fred Heringer and Stan
] Anderson, probably the latter.
Anderson showed in the first game
I of the Big Series that he can subdue
I the Bear hitters. In that contest he
, whiffed ten and issued but two bases
|on balls. Heringer pitched six inn
i ings against the Bruins of U.C.L.A.
I and had them completely baffled
â–  with his fast ball and changes of
I pace.
i Morgan May Catch
The catching burden will probably
Ibe handled by Mike Ferro, but
' Coach Wolter has threatened to re
(place him with Oct Morgan, who is
| reputedly a better hitter. Other po
sitions will be filled as they were in
I the first Cal game. In case Heringer
| should take the mound, A1 Brent
j will go into right field.
It will be the infield that makes or
breaks the team in this second tussle
i with the Golden Bear. Ed Clark and
! Frank Tremaine must play errorless
| ball at short and third or the Bears
! will enjoy an easy afternoon at the
Indians' expense. Errors at inoppor
| tune moments will destroy the ef
j forts of the best pitchers.
Outfield Saving Grace
Stanford's outfield continues to be
j the team's saving grace. Ted Leidig,
j 'Bones' Hamilton and Heringer form
j a dangerous hitting trio and all
j three are fast in the field and on
j the bases.
At the present time the Bears are
i fighting for the conference cham
[ pionship and cannot afford to take
I a set-back. Of course nothing could
be better for the Card from the psy
j chological standpoint. A win over
j Cal would make up for a lot of dis
appointment during the season.
