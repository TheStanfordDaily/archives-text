# MEN'S COUNCIL FINES
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
The editor of "Chaparral" appears
to have followed personal prejudice
without a careful examination of the
facts in his recent diatribe against
the Men's Council. For four years
he let the "abuses" of the Council's
traffic power continue unanswered
until nervous, worried, and terribly
in earnest for the editor of a hu
morous magazine he was given the
minimum fine for speeding in a con
gested area.
The scale of fines used is not
rigid or arbitrary, but elastic. Each
case is considered on its own merits.
The scale is used to insure, not pre
vent, equity; for it enables succes
sive councils to follow a standard
schedule and prevents John Rough
from being fined $5 for going 45 on
Palm Drive while his richer friend
gets off for $2.50 for the same of
fense. Thus the Council insures
equity and fairness to all in the per
formance of its ynpleasant duty of
fining fellow students for the ulti
mate aim of protecting the lives of
pedestrians and motorists.
As to working oIT the fine. There
is only a limited amount of work foi
st udents on the campus. The ad
ministration reserves this for self
supporting students; possession of a
car is regarded as prima facie evi
dence of an individual's ability to
pay a small fine.
The Men's Council's handling of
traffic violations saves students from
long trips to county courts, possible
jail sentences or suspension of li
censes, and maximum fines that
make the Councils' appear small in
comparison.
