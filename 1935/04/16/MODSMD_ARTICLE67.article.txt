# 'Senorita,' Chemists Discover Queer Lice
## 
### CRAIG BARBASH 
Braving rain, a rough sea, wind,
and ill fate, 50 men of Alpha Chi
Sigma, professional chemistry so
ciety, plied to the Farallon Islands
off the coast of San Francisco by
the launch "Senorita," and brought
fish specimens back to the •Farm
Saturday night for one of the first
studies of iish chemistry yet under
taken.
Besides rock and black bass and
deep sea i*ed cod the party ob
served two rare jelly fish, one red
dish brown, one-and-a-half feet in
diameter, and carrying an electric
charge; the other light yellowish
green in color and topped by a sail
formation. Peculiarly formed, the
sail changes and, no matter the
wind, tacks to the port side.
Chief among the prizes, and an un
expected one at that, was captured
when Bill Spaulding hauled up his
line, an octopus attached.

southeast wind that it lurched at a
30 degree angle to the water and a

Coming the 30 miles back from the
I islands, the party donned life pre
servers as a protection from the
wind, and crowding under the bul
wark of the boat, arranged them
j selves in piles, one lying against the
j other.
Specimens, including a group of
sea Jice afloat found near the sur
face, were not gained without the
cost of a slight accident, when some
members of the party were drenched

Diesel engine burst.
