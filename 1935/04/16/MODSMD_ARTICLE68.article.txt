Dear Ken:
When you are good enough to at
tain a high enough position to have
a man as powerful and as influential
as William Randolph Hearst send
you a telegram asking you to write
an editorial on a certain subject
specifying that it will be printed in
his newspaper, then we will be ready
to listen to your running off at the
mouth, for by that time you should
have something to say.
P.G.D.
