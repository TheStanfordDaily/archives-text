Double Styleage and
Mileage in
PALM BEACH
SLACKS
I You can get wash trousers for almost any
price you want to pay. We admit frankly
lhat Palm Beach slacks cost morethan some.
They cost $5. But remember that in these
outdoor days your slacks are an important
part of your wardrobe.
Palm Beach slacks hold their shape and
drape so much better than most summer
trousers. They keep their smart lines. Their
weave is open to admit the air. And their
fuzzless fibres resist dirt. They are being
shown in white and in fashion's newest col
ors. All wash splendidly...And we repeat,
$5 for two legs. At your favorite clothier's.
