### Irvin Jorgensen 
Ex Committee last night appointed j
Bob Church, Encina sponsor, Masque j
Ball chairman, and a member of the
Stanford Cardinals, to fill the Men's
Council office left vacant by Waddy
White, who graduated at the end of I
last quarter.
Church's appointment was recom
mended by Council Chairman A1
Page and by Marvie Kahn, A.S.S.U.
president. He will serve for the rest
of the year, since the A.S.S.U. con
stitution gives the Ex Committee
and the president the power to fill
such vacancies made within a month
of a regular election.
During the other part of the com
mittee's complicated two-hour ses
sion it considered controversial mu
sic council and publications council
minutes and deferred action on them |
until next meeting, gave out several j
commendations for services ren- !
dered, and actually completed the j
work of revising and compiling the i
jumbled by-laws, under the guid- !
ance of Frank Fullenwider, who !
was commended for his work.
Likewise commended wei - e Kahn |
and Vice-President Helen Ray for j
aiding Fullenwider in going over the j
minutes.
Also commended was Ex Commit- i
tee by Kahn for having the patience [
to sit through the many clerical de- j
tails. J
Bob Jones, Cardinal member who
was in charge of constructing the
Big Game bonfire, handed in his re
port which showed the bonfire cost
of only $87.58. Jones was com
mended.
Chairman Will Eisner of the Card- j
inals was instructed to direct his i
committee to co-operate with the
Alumni Day on May 4.
Council minutes were sent
back because it was pointed out that j
they provided for an expenditure of j
$400 for a glee club director, before [
Student Manager Cave had had a j
chance to make out the budget for
next year.
