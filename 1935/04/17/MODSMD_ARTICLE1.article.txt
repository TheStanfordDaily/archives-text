# EX COMMITTEE NAMES CHURCH AS COUNCILMAN
## Music, Publications Council Minutes Considered; Action Deferred BY-LAWS REWRITTEN A.S.S.U. Board Gives Dates, Athletic Awards 
### Irvin Jorgensen 
Ex Committee last night appointed
Bob Church, Encina sponsor, Masque
Ball chairman, and a member of the
Stanford Cardinals, to fill the Men's
Council office left vacant by Waddy
White, who graduated at the end of
last quarter.
Church's appointment was recom
mended by Council Chairman Al
Page and by Marvie Kahn, A.S.S.U.
president. He will serve for the rest
of the year, since the A.S.S.U. con
stitution gives the Ex Committee
and the president the power to fill
such vacancies made within a month
of a regular election.
During the other part of the com
mittee's complicated two-hour ses
sion it considered controversial mu
sic council and publications council
minutes and deferred action on them
until next meeting, gave out several
commendations for services ren-
dered, and actually completed the
work of revising and compiling the
jumbled by-laws, under the guid-
ance of Frank Fullenwider, who
was commended for his work.
Likewise commended were Kahn
and Vice-President Helen Ray for
aiding Fullenwider in going over the
minutes.
Also commended was Ex Commit-
tee by Kahn for having the patience
to sit through the many clerical de-
tails.
Bob Jones, Cardinal member who
was in charge of constructing the
Big Game bonfire, handed in his re
port which showed the bonfire cost
of only $87.58. Jones was com
mended.
Chairman Will Eisner of the Card-
inals was instructed to direct his
committee to co-operate with the
Alumni Day on May 4.
Music Council minutes were sent
back because it was pointed out that
they provided for an expenditure of
$400 for a glee club director, before
Student Manager Cave had had a
chance to make out the budget for
next year.
