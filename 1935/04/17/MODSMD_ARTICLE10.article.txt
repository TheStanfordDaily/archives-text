# Gertrude Stein Sincere, States Kathleen Norris
## 
### CEDRIC LARSON 
America—land of the faddist and I
; home of the oddity.
Yesterday it was cross-word puz
| zles, today Gertrude Stein. Quin
| tuplets or incomprehensible writing
pave with equal efficacy the road to i
fortune. Indeed, Miss Stein's sudclen ;
I rise to glory has sent the once su- i
preme Mae West vogue quite crash
ing to earth.
Stein under Debate
And while psychologists and crit- j
ics hotly debate the schizoid Ger
; I rude Stein and her automatic writ
ting, the object of all this furore un
obstrusively tours the country, ex
pounding to a thousand cars at a
! time her doctrine: "Grammar was
made for man and not man for j
: grammar."
While necks were craned expect
antly last Wednesday as Miss Stein j
walked onto the platform, those who i
anticipated seeing a huge Amazon
burning with true suffragette zeal
against the lowly comma and semi
colon, were somewhat taken* aback
when they perceived an unpreten
tious figure who might easily have
I stepped out of an eccentric Matisse
\ canvas, standing before them and
talking rationally.
Kathleen Norris Talks
On Thursday night as if in con
trast to the stir and bluster of the
previous evening, Kathleen Norris,
author of more than 60 novels, spoke
for two hours in the quiet of a cam
pus home to a group of aspiring
writers.
When queried on#her estimate of
Miss Stein, Kathleen Norris stated
that while the profession of writing
| has bluffers within its ranks like

J any other pursuit, Gertrude Stein
i cannot be regarded as a poser or
! notoriety-seeker.
Stein Unassuming
"I met Gertrude Stein today," said
i Mrs. Norris, "and she remembered
1 meeting me in Paris. She is very
i simple and unassuming. Her theory
| is that we should change the way
i we use the English language, and I
really believe she is going .to have a
j modifying influence on. American
letters.
"A while ago I read her auto
biography, which is so nicely and
j simply done. Although I find that
much of her writing is jargon, the
! next time I sat down to write I
| found myself cutting out half of my
| commas and semicolons.
Writing Has Fads
"When Gertrude Stem talks to
you she has a beautiful continuity of
1 speech," concluded Kathleen Norris.
j"I don't not believe anyone could
I accuse her of being insincere, and
already numbers of American writ
! ers are showing the influence of her
I style."
Perhaps Kathleen Norris is a trifle
, generous to a newcomer to* the front
page of her own craft. Writing, like
; other professions, is beset by the
: faddist with a pet theory to grind.
America is their promised land. One
has a lingering suspicion that pro
fessional eccentrics would not thrive
under the hammer and sickle or the
swastika.
Perhaps it is left for the Coues
and Steins of a future generation to
take the old-world countries in tow
j also with more incomprehensible
e? and subtle techniques.

Kathleen Norris Talks
On Thursday night as if in con
trast to the stir and bluster of the
previous evening, Kathleen Norris,
author of more than 60 novels, spoke
for two hours in the quiet of a cam
pus home to a group of aspiring
writers.
When queried on#her estimate of
Miss Stein, Kathleen Norris stated
that while the profession of writing
| has bluffers within its ranks like

J any other pursuit, Gertrude Stein
i cannot be regarded as a poser or
! notoriety-seeker.
Stein Unassuming
"I met Gertrude Stein today," said
i Mrs. Norris, "and she remembered
1 meeting me in Paris. She is very
i simple and unassuming. Her theory
| is that we should change the way
i we use the English language, and I
really believe she is going .to have a
j modifying influence on. American
letters.
"A while ago I read her auto
biography, which is so nicely and
j simply done. Although I find that
much of her writing is jargon, the
! next time I sat down to write I
| found myself cutting out half of my
| commas and semicolons.
Writing Has Fads
"When Gertrude Stem talks to
you she has a beautiful continuity of
1 speech," concluded Kathleen Norris.
j"I don't not believe anyone could
I accuse her of being insincere, and
already numbers of American writ
! ers are showing the influence of her
I style."
Perhaps Kathleen Norris is a trifle
, generous to a newcomer to* the front
page of her own craft. Writing, like
; other professions, is beset by the
: faddist with a pet theory to grind.
America is their promised land. One
has a lingering suspicion that pro
fessional eccentrics would not thrive
under the hammer and sickle or the
swastika.
Perhaps it is left for the Coues
and Steins of a future generation to
take the old-world countries in tow
j also with more incomprehensible
e? and subtle techniques.
America—land of the faddist and I
; home of the oddity.
Yesterday it was cross-word puz
| zles, today Gertrude Stein. Quin
| tuplets or incomprehensible writing
pave with equal efficacy the road to i
fortune. Indeed, Miss Stein's sudclen ;
I rise to glory has sent the once su- i
preme Mae West vogue quite crash
ing to earth.
Stein under Debate

ics hotly debate the schizoid Ger
; I rude Stein and her automatic writ
ting, the object of all this furore un
