# Indian Track Stars Travel to Edwards Field to Test Oval
## Levy Throws Discus 160 Feet, Sales Tosses Javelin Even 200 Feet in Berkeley Workout 
### WARREN BREED 
Stanford's varsity tr;»ck and field team, tlwir hopcS still rising for a
Big Meet victory Saturday, yesterday afternoon trekked up to Edwards
Field in Berkeley, scene-to-he of the combat, and tested out Berkeley's
various runways, pits, and cinders.
The found the oval right to their liking; Phil Levy \v>is tossing the
discus out around 160 feet and Dud Sales threw the javelin to the last

♦ chalk line—he thought it was 210
feet but it turned out to be a mere
200 Hat.
Coach Dink Templeton still can
| not boast his squad at full strength.
| The chief worry is Humbert Smith,
j who was a cinch for a high jump
j win until he sprained an ankle
■ Monday. Smith did not go to Ber-

| keley with (lie team yesterday; he j
I showed a noticeable limp on the !
; campus, but by Saturday coach and 1
! trainer expect him to soar with the j
■ same old ease.
Another injured Card who is
! possessed with that which can do
; much Saturday is George Tharp, j
j broad jumper from Coalinga. lie
\ has done at best. His heel, in
i jured early in the season, is "just
! fine," he says.
The big Bear question mark is ,
j Mushy Pollock. Thus little mite may !
be out of both sprints and broad j
! jump, or may garner 11 points, de- J
j pending how Maestro Brutus Hamil- j
I ton regards his "cramped muscle just j
i above the knee."
j Ray Dean and Chuck Voigt, Cards ;
who have hit 9.7 and 9.8 in the 100, i
j have been looking greatly im-j
proved in practice starts in the last :
i week. Pollock's start will give him I
an advantage in the 1(J0, but either.
J of the fleet Cards may nose past him
I for a second in the furlong. Both
are also possibilities in the broad
i jump, Dean having done 22 feet
I this week.
Another surprise Indian broad
I jumper, to add'to the swelling list
! ot Riggins, Lindsay, Hershey, Bas
: kin, Dean, Voigt, and Tharp, is Rod
; Bost, the ace forward. Rod went
: to Berkeley with the team yesterday. !
j Big Bob Reynolds, moose tackle,' no
j relation to Jim, also went along as
I utility shot-putter.
