# MOTHERS' CLUB SEE 3-ACT PLAY
## 'Cuckoo's Nest' Presented By All-Star Cast 
### Bud Brill 
"Cuckoo's Nest," a three-act farce
by Eleanor Harris, was read with
success yesterday afternoon before
the Stanford Mothers' Club. The
play recently emerged a powerful
second from the'gale-like Dramatic
Council meeting which chose ''Yel
low Jack" by a five-four vote for
production later this quarter.
Miss Harris's play, one of the
most interesting student-written
works to appear in many years,
has to do with the troubles be
setting a college professor when
lie wishes to make a second mar
riage and finds his children at
tempting to assist this action by
the assumption of various psycho
logical complexes.
Good laugh lines and the possi
bility of much comical business
make the play very entertaining.
However, at times, the play's humor
tends to become repetitious and tire
some. The original farcical situation
remains rather static, and as a re
sult the dialogue built around it
tends to become forced and artificial.
However, the play shows the re
sults of Miss Harris's strenuous ef
forts at revision, since the play has
improved vastly in all ways since it
was first written.
Miss Elizabeth Buckingham, asso
ciate professor of English, intro
duced the players and gave a short
talk on the importance of public
speaking in the training of college
students. Robert Balzer, in a rather
too studied manner, read stage di
rections. The cast was "all-starred"
featuring such well known players
as Shelley Smith, Mary Lisles, Neal
Berry, George Wilson, Annelies
Morgan, Paul Crary, Sidney Head,
Marie Louise Dobbs, and Joe Lawry.
