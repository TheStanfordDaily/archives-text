own, a land of laughs and tears, sun- I
shine and sorrow, where underprivi
leged children fight their way back i
to health under the careful guidance
of the nurses at the Convalescent !
Home. .
It is to help maintain this home j
that Stanford students every year
hold the Convalescent Home Drive, |
which takes place next week.
During the past few days, the j
general committee heads have been '
paying visits to the home, receiving |
inspiration to carry on their labors.
Never Had Luxuries
Here they saw weight charts and j
statistics, but even more Ihey saw
the children themselves, who were
slowly getting back the health that
only <he Home could give them.
Some of the children have never
had what Stanford students with
their bowls of shaving soap and bot
tles of "EaU de Cologne" consider es
sentials. One child told the nurse
that the Home Was the first place
he had ever had enough to eat. 1

learn to laugh and sine. One tiny
mite sang "Love in Bloom" and "Man

When Wffllv Brooke requested
the "Big, Bad Wolfe" the little kid
