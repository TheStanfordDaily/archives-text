# Special Investigations at the San Jose Trial
## 
### 
On and (in drills the Lamson Irinl. A be
wildered jury sils in the jury box, Irving to
glean pertinent fuels from Hie maze of eontra
dielorv evidence offered liv both sides.
No one ean deny th; 11 ;i few mosl unusual
happenings have transpired since February
liS. First, a heavy juryman slipped in his
hath tub in a San .lose hotel over one of the
week-ends, and cracked some ribs. 15<11h prose
cution and defense immediately hopped upon
Ihis incident to prove the strength of their
arguments.
Next, when one of Ihe defense witnesses
was examined as to whether she had received
gifts from Ihe man on trial, her testimony in
part was to the ell'eet that he had onee pur
chased a pair of roller skates for her.
Hut Ihe climax of evidence introduced in a
case where literally thousands of dollars are
being spent was reached when Ihe subject of
identifying people in parked cars came before
Ihe court this past week.
From newspaper reports of Ihe trial, il was
said to be found thai "over the week-end At
torney John Dinwiddie, assistant to Attorney
Fdwin McKenzie, conducted experiments on
Hie Stanford campus," where the defendant
was alleged to have parked the night before
Hit* death of Mrs. I.amson. "Kesnlts were fa
vorable to Ihe defense, McKenzie claimed."
From Ihis we are to gather that legal inves
tigators spent last week-end investigating the
possibilities of discovering the occupants of
parked cars on the campus. Perhaps in the
older days on the Farm, when the cactus gar
dens saw much use, the legal hawks could
have carried on their research work in the
space of a few hours. Hut the spectacle of a
dignified barrister peering into campus cars
Ihis past week-end, attempting to ascertain
j'isl what was to he seen, appears a bit ridicu
lous.
The methods of the law in finding out evi
dence, in accordance with current administra
tion of justice, seem at times a bit farcical.
