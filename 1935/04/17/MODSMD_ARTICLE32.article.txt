INTERNATIONAL DEFENSE

Order Thirteen Warships Out" said the headlines
of January 25, 1932, the first big mention of the Shang
hai controversy in American papers* The story an
nounced that l.'J .ships were sailing from Tokyo to join
the 11 already there awaiting decision on Japanese
demands for suppression ol the anti-Japanese societies.
Although nothing was said about international de
fense plans, a story from London declared, "Japan
will take direct action in Shanghai within the next 72
hours, private advices (some clever lad!) reaching here
today said."
Well down in the story, and unmentioned in the
headlines, we are told "this action (occupation) would
be taken only after representatives of ( ther world
powers were consulted." The deck (secondary head
line) tells us '"Occupation ol bij( Chinese city looms as
gravity of situation grows."
A ( hincse city, yes, but- neither the reader nor
the headwritcr has any way of knowing from the
dispatches that the part to be entered by the Japa
nese was the section where the nationals lived. Nor
could anyone tell from the dispatches that British,
American, French, and Italian troops were like
wise "occupying" the city to defend their nationals ,
—all part of international defense plans.
In 1919, the English had docked a warship and simi
larly sent troops ashore to protect their interests. In
3927, foreign powers (including America) had jointly
occupied' Shanghai to protect themselves against
marauding Chinese soldiers.
On the 27th the headlines'told that "Shanghai Sub
mits to Japanese Demands." The mayor had agreed to
dissolve the offensive boycott societies at 4 p.m. (the
28th in China) before the latest ultimatum expired at 6.
The deck proudly announced: "2400 British and Amer
ican Marines Ready to Defend Foreign Settlement."
True, but so were French, Italian, and Japanese forces.
The implication was that the defense was
n , gainst the Japanese. This was false. The Japa
nese were aiding in the defense, and were not
"invaders" as they were so often labelled in the
days to come.
Under plans for the defense of Shanghai, the French
forces stay within the international boundary; the
Italians stay within a little, but for the most part oper
ate outside: the Americans, ever-cautious, are fortu
nate enough to be able to stay inside. The Japanese,
late-comers to Shanghai, must go outside ihe boundary
in a long, narrow sector to the northeast, since it is
there that most of their nationals live.
The British, however, go outside the line into a
large sector to the west well over twice the size of the
Japanese. (This is well-authenticated—see reports of
the Lytton Commission, for example.)
"Chinese deploy 10.000 troops to defend city
from occupation by Japanese," the dispatch contin
ues. 'I lie statement is nothing short of absurd in
light of the tacts. These troops were of the 19th
Route Army (which in later years rebelled against
the government, and was broken up in dishonor)
and were not defending in any sense.
The next succulent bit says, "China begins open ef
forts to meet possible invasion." The account again
affirms that British and American marines will defend
Shanghai, but neglects 1o say that so will the other
nations. Twelve hundred United States marines have
been there since the days of Chiang Kai-Shek's Na
tionalist drive's menacing Shanghai. (They are there
today, incidentally.) British-American authorities an
nounce our barb-wire on the boundaries is "purely
precautionary."
Full story of the < case: Although the ultimatum had
been met, the Municipal Council did not declare the
state of emergency over. As aforesaid, this was due
mainly to Chinese fleeing into the foreign settlement
from fear of the 19th Army, and to foreign fear of
Chinese riots due to concessions made by the mayor
to the Japanese. Under the emergency state, foreign
powers (including Japanese) moved their men into
defense positions as outlined above.
The Japanese, then, were not launching an at
tack. They had nothing to gain from an attack.
They were trying to hold Chapei, as they were
supposed to do under international defense plans.
That, trouble was a possibility may be seen in that
dispatches quote Japan as .saying an economic block
ade of Shanghai harbor will be used as a last resort
if Chinese regulars attack Japanese sailors end marines
already in Shanghai.
A.s the Japanese moved into their position with the
utmost precision, they were subject to constant sniping
and were attacked by the 19th Army. The Japanese
numbered but 2,000 (mostly young sailors, 18 to 20
years old) and, having to scatter their men for defense
ol a sizable sector, could hardly have been thought to
attack an army (of possibly 30.000) equipped wiih an
armoicd train running on tracks the whole length of
their flank.
But this armored train did fire on the Japanese, as
did artillery, and two divisions of the 19th. Imme
diate! the Japanese negotiated, not wanting their men
completely wiped out. The Chinese general, Ching
"Yung-Kai, now a hero to his countrymen, having par
tially defeated an army about one-fifteenth the size of
his, refused to move back, away from the section, as
he was entreated to do by the Japanese,
Quite naturally, the Japanese did not take this
sitting down. And here is where the trouble starts.
Tomorrow we will note bow American newspapers,
which omitted nearly everything concerning this
phase, rubbed their hands in glee over the "inva
sions," and "bombings" by the Japanese that fol
lowed.

True, but so were French, Italian, and Japanese forces.
The implication was that the defense was

Under plans for the defense of Shanghai, the French
forces stay within the international boundary; the
Italians stay within a little, but for the most part oper
ate outside: the Americans, ever-cautious, are fortu

late-comers to Shanghai, must go outside ihe boundary
in a long, narrow sector to the northeast, since it is
there that most of their nationals live.
The British, however, go outside the line into a
large sector to the west well over twice the size of the
Japanese. (This is well-authenticated—see reports of
the Lytton Commission, for example.)

the government, and was broken up in dishonor)
and were not defending in any sense.
The next succulent bit says, "China begins open ef
forts to meet possible invasion." The account again
affirms that British and American marines will defend
Shanghai, but neglects 1o say that so will the other

been there since the days of Chiang Kai-Shek's Na

today, incidentally.) British-American authorities an
nounce our barb-wire on the boundaries is "purely

Full story of the < case: Although the ultimatum had
been met, the Municipal Council did not declare the
state of emergency over. As aforesaid, this was due
mainly to Chinese fleeing into the foreign settlement
from fear of the 19th Army, and to foreign fear of
Chinese riots due to concessions made by the mayor
to the Japanese. Under the emergency state, foreign
powers (including Japanese) moved their men into
defense positions as outlined above.
The Japanese, then, were not launching an at
tack. They had nothing to gain from an attack.
They were trying to hold Chapei, as they were
supposed to do under international defense plans.
That, trouble was a possibility may be seen in that
dispatches quote Japan as .saying an economic block
ade of Shanghai harbor will be used as a last resort
if Chinese regulars attack Japanese sailors end marines
already in Shanghai.
A.s the Japanese moved into their position with the
utmost precision, they were subject to constant sniping
and were attacked by the 19th Army. The Japanese
numbered but 2,000 (mostly young sailors, 18 to 20
years old) and, having to scatter their men for defense
ol a sizable sector, could hardly have been thought to
attack an army (of possibly 30.000) equipped wiih an
armoicd train running on tracks the whole length of

But this armored train did fire on the Japanese, as

A.s the Japanese moved into their position with the

numbered but 2,000 (mostly young sailors, 18 to 20

ol a sizable sector, could hardly have been thought to
attack an army (of possibly 30.000) equipped wiih an

INTERNATIONAL DEFENSE

Order Thirteen Warships Out" said the headlines
of January 25, 1932, the first big mention of the Shang
hai controversy in American papers* The story an
nounced that l.'J .ships were sailing from Tokyo to join
the 11 already there awaiting decision on Japanese
demands for suppression ol the anti-Japanese societies.
Although nothing was said about international de
fense plans, a story from London declared, "Japan
will take direct action in Shanghai within the next 72
hours, private advices (some clever lad!) reaching here
today said."
Well down in the story, and unmentioned in the
headlines, we are told "this action (occupation) would
be taken only after representatives of ( ther world
powers were consulted." The deck (secondary head
line) tells us '"Occupation ol bij( Chinese city looms as
gravity of situation grows."
A ( hincse city, yes, but- neither the reader nor
the headwritcr has any way of knowing from the
dispatches that the part to be entered by the Japa
nese was the section where the nationals lived. Nor
could anyone tell from the dispatches that British,
American, French, and Italian troops were like
wise "occupying" the city to defend their nationals ,
—all part of international defense plans.
In 1919, the English had docked a warship and simi
larly sent troops ashore to protect their interests. In
3927, foreign powers (including America) had jointly
occupied' Shanghai to protect themselves against
marauding Chinese soldiers.
On the 27th the headlines'told that "Shanghai Sub
mits to Japanese Demands." The mayor had agreed to
dissolve the offensive boycott societies at 4 p.m. (the
28th in China) before the latest ultimatum expired at 6.
The deck proudly announced: "2400 British and Amer
ican Marines Ready to Defend Foreign Settlement."
True, but so were French, Italian, and Japanese forces.
The implication was that the defense was
n , gainst the Japanese. This was false. The Japa
nese were aiding in the defense, and were not
"invaders" as they were so often labelled in the
days to come.
Under plans for the defense of Shanghai, the French
forces stay within the international boundary; the
Italians stay within a little, but for the most part oper
ate outside: the Americans, ever-cautious, are fortu
nate enough to be able to stay inside. The Japanese,
late-comers to Shanghai, must go outside ihe boundary
in a long, narrow sector to the northeast, since it is
there that most of their nationals live.
The British, however, go outside the line into a
large sector to the west well over twice the size of the
Japanese. (This is well-authenticated—see reports of
the Lytton Commission, for example.)
"Chinese deploy 10.000 troops to defend city
from occupation by Japanese," the dispatch contin
ues. 'I lie statement is nothing short of absurd in
light of the tacts. These troops were of the 19th
Route Army (which in later years rebelled against
the government, and was broken up in dishonor)
and were not defending in any sense.
The next succulent bit says, "China begins open ef
forts to meet possible invasion." The account again
affirms that British and American marines will defend
Shanghai, but neglects 1o say that so will the other
nations. Twelve hundred United States marines have
