There is a story about the flag on the second green

Two of Ruble's finest examples of femininity looked 011
the flag with greedy eyes and decided it would look
I just too lovely in their rooms. However, when they got
the flag down to Roble thov couldn't decide how to get
it up to their room without being seen. They left it in
the bushes out in front for a day, and finally decided

planted it squarely beside the front steps of a frater
nity flouse, where it waved for a whole day. Then
somebody swiped it again. Some fun, eh kid?
i I hope that somebody doesn't get similar ideas about
the Berkeley Campanile. Such an action might dis
credit the name of our fair University, and besides it
wouldn't look nice in a room anyway. And besides the
