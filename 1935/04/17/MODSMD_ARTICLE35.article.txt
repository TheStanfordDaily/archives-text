"OF TIME AND TIIE RIVER," by 1
Thomas Wolfe. Scribners. A(
the Stanford Bookstore.
|
For any reviewer to attempt a
brief outline of this 909-page novel
is an impossibility, especially since ;
there is inculcated in the novel five j
years' work of writing, a lifetime of '
experience, and,
a lifetime of
study, both of
the classics and
of modem lit- j
erature. |
"Of Time and
the River" is a
discerning and
minutely told saga of Eugene Gant's j
years at Harvard and in Europe. It
tells of his search, for the unattain
able and unknown reason for exist
ence. Here is carried on the story i

'of Eugene's life, begun in "Look
Homeward Angel," which won
Thomas Wolfe his acclaim three
j years ago, and has been said by
many critics to be the finest litera
-1 ture produced in America.
| Following as it does in the wake
:of this earlier success, this novel
' does not seem to contain as many of
; the elements of greatness. Wolfe is
I not on as sure ground as when he
; narrated the full history of Oliver
iGant, whose life stretched out in
panorama. "Of Time and the River"
! is chaotic and the style is forced in
places. But had this been the first
lof Wolfe's writings to come before
the public, it would undoubtedly
| have received as high praise as
greeted the other, though in com
parison its weaknesses are apparent.
