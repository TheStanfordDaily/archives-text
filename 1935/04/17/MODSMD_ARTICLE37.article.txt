ARE STANFORD WOMEN
STUPID?
: Not content to let the Women's
Edition of The Daily speak for it- |
self, the beauteous editrix of that |
issue deliberately raised the ques- j
tion: Are women beautiful, but :
I dumb? The question could just as i
well be turned around. But since it 1
i is far safer to question the intelli- I
gence than the beauty of any woman, !
we prefer to discuss the mental ap- j
peal of the fairly nice sex.
, The editorial took issue with the 1
i Northwestern professor who said j
that "college girls pretend to be
dumb in order to make men feel j
i superior." To us, that statement
I seemed a highly charitable and gal- j
lant explanation of a rather obvious i
| fact. But the editrix apparently be- I
lieves not only that women are not !
dumb, but that they do not even !
act dumb. Than which there can be j
I no greater loyalty to one's sex.
It may be true — as the editorial j
states—that the professor's remarks i
are certainly not applicable to Stan- \
j ford women. But if that is so—it "is j
| only because Stanford women do not ;
! "feign" dumbness, but rather act j
j completely natural. ,
What is here described as "dumb- i
1 ness" has no reference whatever to i
' the Intelligence Quotient, but rather j
to the use (or disuse) that is made j
of that I.Q. Stanford women may
rate high on the Simon-Binet-Ter- )
man-Stanford intelligence tests, but J
only the Registrar is aware of the j
fact.
Unfortunately, perhaps, people do i
not go around with I.Q.'s blazoned '
i on their sweaters. And in the ab
fsence of such a handy guide, Stan
ford women—as well as men—must
be judged by their more overt ac- j
tions.
If one can put up with the chirp- j
ing that—with most women—sub- i
stitutes for intelligent conversation, i
one can say that Stanford women i
are not dumb.
If one can reconcile sorority \
rushing practices with intelligent j
conduct, one can say that Stanford (
women are not dumb.
If one can believe that intelligent j
women would spend their spare mo
ments in uni-sexual dancing, one ,
can say that Stanford women are not
dumb. j

I Space unfortunately does not per
| mit a detailed account of the decline
|and fall of the "intelligent-college-
I woman", myth. .
It may be objected that Stanford
men act just about as stupid. But we
[have yet to see a Stanford man de
: liberately jump into Laaunita in
\ hopes of an early marriage,
! Yes, Stanford damozels, it will be
! much nicer to accept the professor's
(statement as gospel.

ARE STANFORD WOMEN

: Not content to let the Women's
Edition of The Daily speak for it- |

issue deliberately raised the ques- j
tion: Are women beautiful, but :
I dumb? The question could just as i
well be turned around. But since it 1
i is far safer to question the intelli- I
gence than the beauty of any woman, !
we prefer to discuss the mental ap- j
peal of the fairly nice sex.
, The editorial took issue with the 1
i Northwestern professor who said j
that "college girls pretend to be
dumb in order to make men feel j
i superior." To us, that statement
I seemed a highly charitable and gal- j
lant explanation of a rather obvious i
| fact. But the editrix apparently be- I
lieves not only that women are not !
dumb, but that they do not even !
act dumb. Than which there can be j
I no greater loyalty to one's sex.
It may be true — as the editorial j
states—that the professor's remarks i
are certainly not applicable to Stan- \
j ford women. But if that is so—it "is j
| only because Stanford women do not ;
! "feign" dumbness, but rather act j
j completely natural. ,
What is here described as "dumb- i
1 ness" has no reference whatever to i
' the Intelligence Quotient, but rather j
to the use (or disuse) that is made j
of that I.Q. Stanford women may
rate high on the Simon-Binet-Ter- )
man-Stanford intelligence tests, but J
only the Registrar is aware of the j
fact.
Unfortunately, perhaps, people do i
not go around with I.Q.'s blazoned '
i on their sweaters. And in the ab
fsence of such a handy guide, Stan
ford women—as well as men—must
be judged by their more overt ac- j
tions.
If one can put up with the chirp- j
ing that—with most women—sub- i
stitutes for intelligent conversation, i
one can say that Stanford women i
are not dumb.
If one can reconcile sorority \
rushing practices with intelligent j
conduct, one can say that Stanford (
women are not dumb.
