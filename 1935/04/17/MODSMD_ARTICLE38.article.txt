ACE IN THE HOLE'
FOR CARDS SATURDAY

Even worse than telling a kid
there is no Santy Claus is exposing
an "ace in the hole." It seems a
shame to take the kick out of the
Big Meet thrill some Stanford fol
lowers are going to get next Satur
day when one of Dink Templetou's
unknowns come through, but I can't
resist the opportunity to scoop some
of the city sport writers.
Last year at the N.C.A.A. Stanford
won the meet with the unexpected
points of a great little sprinter in
Jimmy Willson, a prep ace who
fought his way through three years
of pulled muscles and even had to
pay his own for one big day after
years of conscientious training.
Another sprinter is all set to pull
the meet out of the fire for Stan
ford next S;*£urday. Ray Dean,
San .Mateo J.C. transfer, seems fi
nally ready to hit his 1935 stride,
after three months of attempts to
become a quartcr-milcr an«l dis
entangling himself from scholastic
troubles and sore muscles.
Dean will be one of the Indian en
trants in the sprints and the broad
jump. He defeated Cal's George
Anderson in the 100-yard dash the
only time the two met last year.
Monday he triwd a bit of the broad
jumping (last year his best was close
to 23 feet) and hit 22 reet without
even taking enough jumps to get his
step. His junior college record labels
him as a money runner. Watch him
Saturday.

SOUTHWEST HAS
CLASSY MARKS

It seems that there have been
some track meets in the Southwest
this spring. At the Texas Relays the
following times and distances were
recorded: a 14.2 flight of high hurdles
by Sam Allen of Oklahoma Baptists;
9.4 100-yard dashes by Herman
Neugass of Tulane and Chink Wal
lender of Texas; 6 feet 5% inches in
the high jump, by Linn Philson of
Drake; and 163 feet 3 1 i inches in
the discus by Jess Petty of Rice.
