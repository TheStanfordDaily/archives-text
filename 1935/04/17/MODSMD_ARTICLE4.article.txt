# SPRING MUSICAL IDEA TENTATIVE
## Hart Preston Presents Plan To Dramatic Council 
### 
A harassed Dramatic Council,
still unsettled over their recent vit
riolic venture into the sphere of the
politic, decided that thei'e might be
"Music in the Spring." At a special
meeting yesterday they decided that
a spring musical production, in the
nature of an intimate revue, and
featuring original sketches and mu
sic by students combined with
sketches by such nolewoiihies as
George Kaufmann, Ring Lardner,
and Dorothy Parker, was a distinct
possibility.
Hart Preston presented the plan
to the council with the philanthro
pic motive of lining the Dramatic
Council from the depths of its
financial despair and with the hope
that it would furnish to the cm
pus the type of lighter entertain
ment which made a hit in the last
Big Game Gaieties. "The intimate
revue," said Hart, "has won much
popularity at Yale, Chicago, and
California, and is ideally suited
for student production.''
However, the Council, frightened
at the thought of raising the red-ink
bearing ghost of the Junior Opera,
refrained from making a final deci
sion at the time. A committee com
posed of Robert Ransom, Dick Daw
son, and James Benet was formed
for the purpose of seeing whether
adequate and feasible arrangements
could be made and a non-conflicting
date for the production late in May
secured.
