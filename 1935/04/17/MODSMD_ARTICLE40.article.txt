# INDIAN BALL NINE IN SECOND GAME WITH CALIFORNIA
## Cards Fight to Keep Bears From Championship 
### Bob Leland 
Varsity nines of Stanford and
California will clash in the second
game of the annual Big Series at
the Sunken Diamond tomorrow af
ternoon at 3:15 o'clock.
Co-Captain Stan Anderson is slat
ed to do the pitching in what should
be a crucial contest for Cal. With
the Uclans faltering, the Bears have
a good chance to cop the league title.
It will be a battle of giant and
dwarf as far as all-around team
strength is concerned. Stanford is
holding tenaciously to the cellar po
sition and nothing can seemingly be
done about it.
Although they have no chance of
getting out of the cellar, the Indian
horsehiders are in an excellent posi
tion to dump the favored Beai's and
keep them from gaining the title.
There are several weak spots that
keep the Cards down. Poor base
hitting has been a constant source
of worry to Coach Harry Wolter, as
has been the team's inability to bunt.
Only Bones Hamilton seems to be
adept at the art. As for real power
hitting, there isn't any such thing.
Ted Leidig, co-Captain Fred Her
inger, Gordy Mallatratt and Hamil
ton are the only consistent hitters of
the team and they don't pack much
extra-base punch. It is hard to score
runs when one-base blows are prac
tically the sole result of batting ef
forts.
Since they can't depend on hitting
sprees to win games, the Cards must
play errorless ball in the field. It
will be up to Howell Turner, Ed
Clark, and Frank Tremaine to handle
the ball with care and keep from
heaving the pellet far out of reach
of Mallatratt at first. The latter sin
has been losing more games of late
than faulty fielding.
The Bears will likely throw their
ace, Lefty Hardt, against Anderson
in the hope of clinching the series.
Hardt dropped a close decision to the
Bruins a week ago due to faulty
fielding. Provided Old Sol can keep
the upper hand, these two should put
on a pitching exhibition worth
watching. It appears that Mike Fer
-10 will handle the catching burden
with Arleigh Williams of football
fame doing the x - eceiving for the
Bears.
