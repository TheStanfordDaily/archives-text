# Gridders Will Hold Workout On New Plays
## Five Teams Will Take Part In First Competition 
### 
Claude E. Thornhill will take time
I off from his dabbling with "brain
storms" Friday to watch his five
j varsity football teams engage in
I free-for-all competition in their first
scrimmage of the spring practice
j season.
Tiny has spent the past two
weeks of workouts drilling the
1935 potentials oil fundamentals
and new plays and formations,
which they will use extensively
in the scrimmage.
According to present plans, the
Friday workout will be informal,
with each team being run for 10 or
15 minutes at a stretch.
The acting first string, in the
absence of Monk Moscrip, Bones
Hamilton, and a few of the other
varsity lettermen who have not
1 reported as yet, will find Alf
Brundin at center, Larry Rouble
I and Woody Adams at the guard
positions, Boh Reynolds and Dale
Beedle •«t tackles, and Keith Top
ping and Alex Trompas at ends.
Frank Alusti/.a. Bobby Grayson,
Kay Lewis, and Johnny Keisner
compose the present hackfleld
combination.
Beedle, who has been out of school
until this spring, has been working
smoothly in the first-string line. He
apparently has lost some weight,
but handles himself well.
Shelly Bronstein, letterman of
1933 who was recuperating from a
knee injury all through last season,
has lost none of hi»s speed, and prob
ably will press Reisner for left half
before the spring practice is over.
Lewis is working at right half until
Hamilton finishes his baseball activ
ities.
