over Newton. Dey should not have
too much trouble with Schwartz, but
Seward may have his hands full in
playing White, who has ranked
higher than fourth on the Califor
nia outfit at times in the past. The

! match between Lynch and Massie i
may be one of the be.st, and the
Pommer-Tanaka affair is doped as a i
toss-up.

Bennett and Newton form a strong |
i doubles team, having nearly beaten
Dey and Seward last year as frosh.
The two Bears may make things hot
