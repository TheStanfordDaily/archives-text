# YEARLING CINDER STARS MEET U.C. FRESHMEN FRIDAY
## Bear Cubs Favored to Win By Narrow Margin 
### Gordon Frost 
Their last hard workout set for
; this afternoon, Stanford's little squad
( of frosh track men are beginning to
sense the fact that Friday afternoon
| on Angell Field they face the test of
! the season when a team of fighting
J Bear Cubs from California will at
i tempt to repeat in some measure
' that 88-43 walloping they handed the
Card yearlings last year.
! It is hardly possible to say that the
i Indian frosh are out for revenge;
they weren't even Stanford students
! when last year's shelacking was ad
j ministered, but they will be eager
to prove that all this talk about the
| "weak Stanford frosh" doesn't apply
j as far as Cal is concerned.
Comparative Scores
California dopesters have prophe
| sied that the Blue and Gold yearlings
j hold an advantage in the neighbor
| hood of 10 points. This is declared
j to be true by virtue of the fact that
: the Bears downed Alameda-All-
Stars 78 to 43 while the Indians se
! cured only a 69-53 victory.
This writer does not hold that
j Stanford should be favored to win
by a margin of many points, but
! doubts the probability of a Stanford
I defeat by 10 points. Rather, the local
I belief by coaches and team mem
j bers is that the meet will be decided
I by five points or less.
California has given decidedly su
perior showings in early season
j meets in the 440, broad jump, and
pole vault and can be counted on to
capture firsts in these events. On the
other hand Stanford's mile, two
: mile, 100-yard dash, and discus
I showings indicate victory possibili
ties in these fields.
Most Events Even
In most of the other events neither
squad can be favored. The low hur
dle race between Cy Oberg of the
. Card frosh and Kent Weaver of the
Cubs is sure to be a thriller. Both
men won their events against high
! school teams last Saturday; both
were timed at 25.2 seconds.
Another battle will be staged when
j Dan Carter, undefeated Bear half
â€¢ miler, matches strides with Stan
ford's newly elected captain, Edson
Burrows. Hank Luisetti and Cal's
Chuck Weaver will be fighting for
high jump victory; both with rec
ords of six feet cleared.

J emies by imitating thorns.
