# CAMPUS OPINION
## THE 						CUCKOO ANSWERS 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
NOW THAT campus opinion yes
terday seems to leave the OLD BOY
no leg to stand on. Ho has, how
ever, a couple of optics which see
things (including editorial intent)
differently from those o! Mr. Leo
Cook, member of Men's Council.
In the first place, the editorial was
not a "diatribe" (Can we borrow
that word after The Daily is fin
ished with it?) "against the; Men's
Council. Rather, it was, as speci
fically stated, attacking the SYSTEM
and administration of a "rigid scale
of fines."
Then, too, the OLD BOY cannot
agree with Mr. Cook as to the mean
ing of "elasticity" and with his idea
of "equity." Is there any elasticity
in a FIXED scale which the Council
itself admits it must adhere to?
"Each case is considered on its own
merits," but does such consideration
consider the EFFECT of the penalty
upon the individual? Does the fact
that John Rough, working his way
through school, is fined the same
amount for (he same offense as John
Dough, who has a nice fat allowance,
insure EQUITY in punishment?
The intent of the editorial was to
point out this discrepancy of Stan
ford justice in the bearing of the
burden of fines set by scale and also
the fact that no allowance is granted
whereby in cases of necessity labor
may be substituted in lieu of cash
settlement. (There was no "personal
prejudice"—the OLD BOY was only
one of many who have been denied
the privilege of working off fines.)
Mr. Cook and the administration's
regard of the possession of a car as
prima facie evidence of ability to pay
a fine is unsound. There are on the
campus Model T Ford trucks as well
as Packards—and sometimes the
student apprehended and fined is
driving a borrowed car.
Chappie's editorial never accused
the Council of "working against the
Stanford students." Rather, recog
nizing that it IS working with them,
the consideration of a change of
policy was suggested.
Sincerely,
Gordon Steedman
