# MAKE PEACE PRACTICAL
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Dr. Wilbur, in a manner befitting
a successor of David Starr Jordan,
graciously approved the holding of
peace conferences at Stanford on
April 12. Out of the discussions
which took place several points
emerged which may serve as guide
posts to every thoughtful student.
Most of all, it seemed evident that it
is not enough merely to wish for
peace. Those who desire peace must
DO something about it.
A first step suggested is to join a
peace organization. There are many
of these, but one which correlates
the work of about 30 organizations is
the National Council for Prevention
of W ir, which has a branch office at
68 Post Street, San Francisco. Mem
bers receive the monthly bulletin,
"Peace Action," which keeps one in
formed regarding the trend of events
and suggests further lines of action.

Another step is to let the govern
ment know how one feels about spe
cific courses of action. The jingo
I press and radio mustered 40,000 tele
grams into the Senate at the crucial
time to defeat World Court adher
ence, while the peace forces re
mained comparatively silent. If, for
example, one believes that the pro
posed far-flung naval maneuvers in
J the Pacific on May 5 represent a bel
i ligerent shaking of the fist in Japan's
! faceâ€”why not write a brief letter
j to the president to that effect, before
it is too late?
When war comes, the way of the
j conscientious objector will go hard,
j What tremendous courage it re
quires in time of war to exhibit the
j higher patriotism and say, "I do not
j want my country to take part in
I anything so insane and .suicidal as
j war. I will take no part in it."
j Now, it may not yet he too late, if
| enough of us place ourselves on roc
i ord with our government as opposed
jto war, to avert the storm which
j threatens us.
Very truly yours,
Elsie R. Renne
