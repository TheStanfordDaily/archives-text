# PERSPIRES TOO
## 
### 
J The Editoi - , Sir:
I As another perspiring student I
| note with approval the present move- j
1 ment of The Daily to reduce the
temperature of the library to a more i
j suitable one for study. It has been
too high for so long that most of us |
; have almost become acclimated to it, !
but we would all, I think, appre- i
ciate this change.
Keep up the good work.
Yours hopefully,
M. Sprott Boyd
