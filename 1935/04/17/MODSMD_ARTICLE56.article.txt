P. G.D.:

Your respect for power as applied ■
even to the realm of thought is to |
me surprising and not altogether |
pleasing. It is quite possible that ,
Mr. Livingston will never be "good '
enough" to receive telegrams from j
Mr. Hearst, but I daresay you have !
listened to others who have never j
had that rare privilege. Why not J
judge ideas for their own value j
lather than by the name of their
author? I hope you will not take |
offense at my statements, and if I |
have misinterpreted you I am sin- !
cerely sorry. Above all I hope that !
I shall not be considered unkind.
