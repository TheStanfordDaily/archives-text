| Gustave Pauli, German art authority
j who is making a three months' lec
ture tour of the United States, ad
! dressed a relatively small audience
I in the Assembly Hall last night on
! the subject of "Romantic Art Today
I in Germany."
Beginning his locture with a brief
! sketch of the revolt from the class
j ical tendencies of the 17th and early
J 18th centuries, he defined romanti
' cism as appealing to the feelings
j rather than to reason.
Dr. Pauli stated Romanticism
| W's first a literary movement,
traveled next to the plastic arts,
: particularly sculpture, and then
! to {minting. It appeared in its pur
| est forms in the works of the two
I German artists, Phillipp Otto
I Runge and Caspar David Fried
rich.
| As illustrations of his point, Dr.
| Pauli flashed a number of repro
' ductions from both these artists on
| the screen. Runge he named the
I greater and pointed out as his dom
! inant characteristics a certain dig
nity or gesture as well as a naivete,
| particularly in the "Portrait of His
| Parents."
Friedrich, he described as more
j than a mere observer of nature,
for he penetrated into the heart of
nature. He painted landscapes
! such as "The Two Men Looking at
I a Scene."
j In conclusion Dr. Pauli affirmed
| that although Romanticism is pri
i marily of the emotions, neither can
lit be divorced from reason. For, he
' stated, it inspires a conception of
I new truth, and thus provides a
! stimulus to science.
