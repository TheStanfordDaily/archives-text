# Interviewer Finds Stein as Puzzling As All Others Have
## Eccentric Believes Herself To Be Successor To Walt Whitman 
### 
The eccentric of today is the gen
us of tomorrow.
To Emerson, Edgar Allan Poe was
a "jingle-man," yet Poe's reputa
tion grows with each decade.
While skeptics scoff at the voice
of Gertrude Stein crying in the wil
derness, and the most sapient of
psychologists label her a schizoid,
the little lady with a skull-cap head
of gray hair goes about quite unper
turbed and fancies herself holding
liigh the torch of independence in
American letters thrown to her from
'he hand f>[ Walt Whitman.
She has acquired what the artists
■all an "eye" for oil paintings, and
believed in Matisse, Picasso, and
Cezanne when this trio were a stench
in the nostrils of the world of art.
She had the uncanny knack of bet
ting her money on the right horse,
so to say, in the field of modernistic
art.
To the refined spirits who believe
that art is not to be reconciled with
lidactic purpose, she and her strange
Joctrines oi oil painting arc a puz
zlement.
' Everyone should have a hobby or
pursuit removed from his regular
me of activity, Miss Stein advocates.
Her avocation is oil painting.
What lies behind those restless,
brown eyes is a question. Cour
teous and polite to all comers, she
remains mentally alert to every
query that is put to her. Autograph
hunters galore crowded about her,
and with a genial air worthy of a
Queen Victoria, she vouchsafed to
every one a precious signature. Like
ill celebrities, her handwriting is an
illegible scrawl—"Gtde St-dash,"
witn a scratching flourish it is all
over. She has probably signed her
name thousands of times for auto
graph collectors in the past few
weeks.
Gertrude Stein plans to sail for
France in the early part of May.
There .she will return to the old life
of repetitious writing and dreaming
in front of the huge oil canvasses
which grace the interior of the
Louvre.
"I come and go like the ripple on
a stream" might well be Miss Stein's
theme song, for with her packing her
grip and going back to Paris, the
abyss of oblivion yawns invitingly
for Gertrude and and the Stein
inylh.
