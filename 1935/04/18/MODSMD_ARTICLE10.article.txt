# 'CLIPPER' ENDS HOP PROMPTLY
## Airplane Lands after Easy Flight Across Pacific 
### 
HONOLULU, April 17 (/P).—Pre- j
liminary commercial air service be- |
tween the American mainland and !
Hawaii was inaugurated today when 1
the huge flying boat Pan-American
Clipper alighted here to complete a
swift, sure flight from Alameda, Cal
ifornia. i
The big plane went through her j
schedule like a limited train through i
a time table.
Her flight marked the beginning j
of a new era in American aviation— |
regular service all the way across |
the Pacific, to be established this ,
summer.
She lopped exactly seven hours of! !
the previous record and had to slow
down occasionally and even leave i
her course to make her time 17 hours |
45 minutes for the 2400-mile all- j
water route.
Although the flying Clipper was
sandwiched between enormous cloud j
strata hiyh in the air for hundreds
of miles, her personnel always knew
exactly where they were, for they
followed an invisible but certain
guiding force—radio waves.
She landed at Pearl Harbor at :
7:57 a.m. (1:27 p.m. E.S.T.), just
three minutes ;ihead of scheduled
time. Her crew of six stepped
ashorj unfatigued, freshly shaven
and conventionally clothed, much
as they would have left a Pullman
car after an overnight journey.
