# HITLER BLASTS LEAGUE ACTION; FEARS WAR ACT
## Reich Stunned as Poland, Other Nations Condemn Germans' Rearming 
### 
BERLIN, April 17 (A 3 ). —A reply |
to the League of Nations' rebuke for |
rearming Germany which officials
here said "would leave nothing to
be desired in the way of plain
speech" was being drafted tonight
by Adolf Hitler at his Bavarian
mountain retreat.
The Wilhelmstrasse, meanwhile,
seemed stunned at the Geneva de
velopment, particularly because Ger
many's official friend, Poland, joined
13 other nations'represented on the
council in voting for the tripower
resolution condemning treaty viola
tions.
Persons well acquainted with the
status of Germany's rearmament ex
pressed concern that through some
act considered a violation of the
league covenant, Germany might
find herself in a state of war.
Despite boasts as to advanced con
dition of the rearmament, well-in
formed persons say there is much
doubt as to whether these boasts arc
well founded. Germany's only cer
tain reserve is her man power, but
technical equipment still is sadly
lacking.
Reichswehr officers make no secret
of the fact they consider the army
in a state of reorganization. They
said they hoped that the forthcoming
month may pass off without unto
ward incident so that they may at
least complete their technical reor
ganization.
The league's censure, German offi
cials said tonight, either destroys or
seriously retards prospects that Ger
many will join any peace pacts.
These sources declared it out of
the question for Germany, in view
of the council's rehuke, to partici
pate in the Danuhian conference
at Home or the larger conference
projected in the recent tri-power
parley at Stresa.
It was emphasized, however, thfit
the entire problem has been put up
to Reichsfuehrer Hitler, and he alone
will decide what course the Reich
! shall pursue in the face of the ad
f verse action.
Most surprising and shocking to
| German officials was Poland's sup
port for the resolution, since, neutral
: observers pointed out, without Po
land Hitler stands alone in a turbu
