# Actors Asked To Forget Barbers, Look Scientific

"Don't get your hair cut!" ad
monished Dramatic Director Wil
liam Murray Timmons.
Twenty-five men stood aghast,
j consternation growing as Timmons
explained his command. The men
were featured players in "Yellow
Jack," spring quarter Dramatic
Council production. They portray
scientists working in the heat of
laboratories throughout the world,
far away from civilization and
I barbers.
And they cah't get their hair cut
until the final curtain has been rung
J down and ihe last smear of make-up
removed after the campus per
formance.
"Of course, they'll be uncomfort
able and look a little shaggy in
classes, but how would it look for a
man to have a cleanly trimmed neck
in the middle of South America?"
inquired Manager Dick Frank.
That is not, however, the only rea
son, according to Timmons. "As a
matter of fact, there's nothing un
t usual in my request," he explained.

"I suggest that for almost every
play. There's a tradition that actors
always have long hair, for the simple
reason that if it's been cut recently,
the actor looks from Ihe stage as
though he had merely a scalp lock
on top of his head."
"How arp you going to enforce it?"
he was asked.
"That's simple. If their hair is cut,
they get a thorough application of
; grease paint." This, he added, will
take away that swath of unsun
burned .skin which appears after a
visit to the barber.
Three hardy souls objected.
"What'll we do in class? Carry a
violin case?" they queried plain
tively.
Frank O'Neill, playing Major Reed,
shows promise of having the longest
locks. He appears in a play in Palo
Alto this week-end, for which he
had to abandon neck trims. His hair
is fast approaching the shaggy stage.
"It's a shame," smilingly agreed
Timmons, "but no haircuts until af
jter the play!"
