# Huey No Clown, Club Informed
## 
### 
A small audience of 31 persons,
â€¢ plus a Daily reporter, Chairman
! Sterling Cotti-ell, and speakers Sam
| Glen and Spencer Thompson, at
tended a Walrus Club meeting on the
subject of "Why Huey Long?" in
the Women's Clubhouse last night.
Sam Glenn, speaking in favor of
| Long, tried first to show that Huey
| is not the buffoon that the press has
| made him out. In fact, according to
; Glenn, it is the newspapers of the
j country that are almost entirely rc
' sponsible for the general low opinion
of Huey outside of Louisiana.
As an example of newspaper
! treatment of the Senator, Glenn said
; that a newspaper in Louisiana
j printed the Sands Point black eye
i incident three days before it hap
pened, implying that Huey was
j framed.
I His second point was that Huey's
program really was constructive and
j would benefit the laboring man. His
i share-the-wealth plan was cited as
evidence against fascistic tendencies.
Spencer Thompson reiterated his
usual point that America faces a
. choice between socialism and fas
cism, and said that becausc Huey
favored the retention of private
! property he would inevitably be
forced to the support of fascism.
The meeting was adjourned fol
lowing the two talks, but an infor
mal discussion was staged by the
two speakers and a few others.
