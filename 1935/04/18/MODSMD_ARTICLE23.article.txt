To Be Informal
I To enliven the evening's proce
dure, the four participants are ex
j pected to indulge in considerable
I joking and kidding during the de-
I bate for the benefit of the audience.
This "Stanford's family debate,"
! though it will be held on the formal
'arms and munitions question, will
deviate from the purely intellectual
'aspects of the topic, and will aim to
be entertaining as well as interesting
I and educational.
Debate Manager Bob Gros, who
arranged both the eastern and
j western tours and hence is torn
| between the two teams, will be
j chairman of the evening. Follow
-1 ing the debate, the floor will be
J open to audience questioning.
So that the decision of the judges
'may be a true cross-section opinion
I of the audience, a large committee of
! 13 has been chosen, including rep
| resentatives of the student body,
faculty, administration, and Palo
Alto. Comptroller Almon Roth will
| be chairman of the committee.

According to Kahn, "The all-Stan-
I ford debate is a worthy tiling, and
j should be supported to show the de-
I haters that Stanford appreciates the
I fine publicity they have brought to
• the University, and to aid materially
|in helping the Convalescent Home
Drive."
