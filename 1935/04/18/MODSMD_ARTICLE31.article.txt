# Chappie and Traffic Fines Do Not Mix

### 
NOW THAT llit* venerable Cuckoo and ;i
member of Men's Council have both had their
s;iy in print, I Ik* Daily steps forth to enter
the arena, in defense of neither C.haparral nor
the council, hut perhaps to justify hoth sides.
Our worthy fellow editorialist who blasts
out with words of wisdom onse a mouth, said
that the lines imposed hy the council were
sometimes excessive in nature, and that there
"were "abuses" of the council's traffic power.
The representative of the Men's Council
answered this argument hy saying that the
imposition of lines on the campus for viola
tions of trallic is standardized that I hey arc
designed to see that the wealthy student with
his new Packard and the hashing student
with his live-year-old Model "A" are assessed
equally for sprinting up Palm Drive.
The Daily's idea on the subject is simply
this: perhaps it would he wise were there
some manner in which students could work
oil' their lines, could they prove a legitimate
case of being broke. After all, there tire some
cases where ownership of a car docs not prove
evidence of the individual's ability to pay a
line.
As to the Men's Council. They have admit
tedly the most efficient system of handling vio
lations on the campus. Long before the mem
ory of present seniors, automobile olTenses on
I lie harm were dealt with by the Santa Clara
county courts. Such a system was not just,
and that was why it was superseded by the
present set-up.
It is true that the council is working with
the students and not against them. So per
haps the Venerable One, in meaning to delve
into a situation, stuck out his gri/./.led chin a
bit too far, and some of the bristles got pulled
oil*.
