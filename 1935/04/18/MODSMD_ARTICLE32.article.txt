# Dignify and the Stanford Radio Hour
## 
### 
Kvery Monday night at 8 o'clock Stanford
goes on I lie air with its usual appropriate dis
cussion of a specific aspect of current events.
Disguised under such a pretense, this week's
quarter-hour program, however, was purely
a plea to wealthy Stanford alumni for mone
tary gifts.
Dr. Ilarrv H. Reynolds, president of Stan
lord Associates, told how privately endowed
universities have approached the economic
crossroads, where, unless additional endow
ments or bequests are secured, current ex
pansion programs must be curtailed, with the
attending improbability of maintaining the
quality scholarship standards.
The advantages of the private institution
over the public university were the basis for
his plea. He pointed out how privately en
dowed colleges can foster social, moral, and
political doctrines that the public university
cannot, being hampered by the whims of the
electorate and by the pressure of Ihe legisla
ture. "Curriculum in state institutions," he
declared, "must be devised with consideration
for every shade of thought and trend of opin
ion in the electorate."
1 le went on to show that "in the present lime
of chaotic thinking, of unrestrained moral lib
erty, and of radical social advocacy, the re
strained, conservative, steadying inllucnce of
faculties free from political expedience is not
an inconsiderable factor in training youth."
Dr. Reynolds drove home his pica for gifts
with Ihe statement that a student pays only
51,400 for an education that costs the univer
sity * 1,000.
Stanford, it is true, can choose the subject
matter of its own program, lint whether it is
correct to make an out-and-out plea for more
funds is rather questionable.
