### JOHN L. KLINE 
(Foreword: Although much of the material
given in these articles somewhat justifies Japan,
no pro-Japnnese stand is especially held by the
writer. No doubt the Japanese were not blame
less, nor did they always conduct themselves well.
Had blood between China and Japan is well
known; bitterness was to be expected. Facts here
in are those supporting a little-known side, since
they were not presented in this country's press.
â€”J.L.K.)
