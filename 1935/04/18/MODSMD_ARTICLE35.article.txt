# TERROR AND CONFUSION
## 
### 
Landing parties entered Chapei starting at midnight
on January 28, 1932, to protect Japanese nationals and
stop widespread looting. Chinese snipers harassed
these forces from the first and fighting became more
severe, making the day cf the 29th one of confusion in
this sector of Shanghai, and giving us countless ex
amples of unfair and unintelligible garbling of the
I news.
! "Jap Troops Take Shanghai" was how blaring
i streamers reported this in Thursday, the 28th. after-
I noon papers in America. (It was now the morning of
the 2Dth in Shanghai.) "Invaders pierce defenses of
j Chinese as planes bomb city, warships shell forts," add
ed the second head. Technically, the Japanese might
| be called "invaders," but to baldly brand them such in
j articles for people unfamiliar with Shanghai's prob
! lems, without explaining the necessity and justification
for their action is little short of gross misinterpretation.
First words in the United Press account said
"The Japanese occupied the Chinese city of Shang
hai and engaged the Chinese defenders in fierce
machine gun lighting." Japanese did not occupy
the whole Chinese city, as implied, never even
reaching their origins] defense objective. To en
title the Chinese "defenders" somewhat glorifies
them. To say the Japanese did the engaging places
the fault with them, even though presumably they
were going in to restore order, and could hardly
be thought stupid enough deliberately to provoke
the Chinese directly under the eyes of the foreign
powers.
Possibly the only American newsman who sent
j home comprehensive, factual, and reasonably accurate
; reports what Hallett Abend (Stanford man, '03-"04) of
the New York Times, the caliber of which allowed him
i to be less sensational than his fellows. His lengthy
i dispatch covering this day of rumor and misinforma-
I tion notes especially the shift of sentiment at this
j time.
Chinese resistance had been so tenacious that Jap
-1 anese hopes of occupying the section in an houi' or
j two had been blasted. As the day progressed, the
! Japanese dropped GO bombs. The bombing scared Ihe
foreigners, and changed their erstwhile desire to see
j Japan teach China a lesson in regard to treatment of
j foreigners into a feeling that the Japanese were bullies.
This natural phenomenon of favoring the idea of
| action before it took place, but becoming horrified
i when things were actually blown up, infected all the
j correspondents. Only Abend was quick enough to
recognize the existence of his own and others' preju
dice and try to offset it. Even he admittedly found
| himself distressed by the "truculence" of Japan's
sailors, marines, and numerous semi-militarized civil—
\ ians.
Most accounts were distinctly anti-Japanese be
cause of the sentiment prevalent in Shanghai, the
j known distaste for Japan in America, and the more
melodramatic "war" stories which could be worked
up by using this "slant." When facts failed to fit
the case, they were omitted, enlarged, 6r snowed
under by strongly worded, colorful descriptions
j which were really opinion but were sent out as
' news.
Uncritical readers were given an impression of a
i big Jap ogre pouncing on poor Shanghai by such in
nuendo as "expertly, as though this campaign had
been carefully laid out in advance." How many read
'• ers stopped to remember unemotionally that all mod
-1 ern troop movements are minutely planned in advance.
Such references to the Japanese as "armed to the
teeth," and "the invaders came in two waves," further
a false effect, while staying within bounds of literal
i accuracy.
"Japs Raid American Mission," streamers of the
! 29th told the American public. The incident was ex
ceedingly minor, a few Japanese looking in the mission
, (probably for snipers) for anti-Japanese literature,
j according to the press acount. Thus "raid" was played
; up in the main stories, whereas Japanese assurances
i of non-interference with American and British rights
! in the international settlement were given less con
! spicuous spots.
"U. S. Fleet Ready for Action in the Orient" was
the type of headline designed to appeal to the Amer
; ican audience the next day. The 'permanent truce
| meeting' at the British Consulate found a little space
farther down. Stories of the news services neglected
to mention that the truce of 8 p.m. of the 29th was
broken by Chinese on the morning of the 30th.
New York Times accounts of this day were fair
enough to repeat Japanese announcements of re
luctance to open military operations in Shanghai
due to international complications, even though
Tokyo felt the landing parties adequate to cope
only with mobs, but not with the regulars in
street -fighting.
Defense agreements were openly violated on the
31st. Embittered by their repulse in Chapei, Japanese
J took over a nearby part of the settlement near the
center of town, ousting Municipal Council forces. This
! was meat for the news services.
At this time, the A.P. told us: "Goaded by the Japa
| nose invasion of Shanghai, the Chinese National Gov
ernmeot decided to declare war on Japan." Official
| announcement was not yet out, A.P. went on to say,
but since Chinese officials did not deny it, it must be so.
Beyond a doubt, Japan did use bad judgment, was
ruthless at times and destroyed much property. On the
| big opening day. the 29th, about 1000 Chinese (mostly
| civilians) are supposed to have been killed, and about
; a square mile of populous area razed by fires and
I bombs.
This does not, however, justify unfair news treat
i ment by American correspondents, nor omissions of
| vital facts, nor unnecessarily sensational and provoca
tive "play" by American papers.
Tomorrow, the concluding article will note a
few more points overlooked by the papers, rather
than attempt the near-impossible task of analyz
ing exactly what did happen in Shanghai.

on January 28, 1932, to protect Japanese nationals and
stop widespread looting. Chinese snipers harassed
these forces from the first and fighting became more
severe, making the day cf the 29th one of confusion in
this sector of Shanghai, and giving us countless ex
amples of unfair and unintelligible garbling of the
I news.
! "Jap Troops Take Shanghai" was how blaring
i streamers reported this in Thursday, the 28th. after-
I noon papers in America. (It was now the morning of
the 2Dth in Shanghai.) "Invaders pierce defenses of
j Chinese as planes bomb city, warships shell forts," add
ed the second head. Technically, the Japanese might
| be called "invaders," but to baldly brand them such in
j articles for people unfamiliar with Shanghai's prob
! lems, without explaining the necessity and justification
for their action is little short of gross misinterpretation.
First words in the United Press account said
"The Japanese occupied the Chinese city of Shang
hai and engaged the Chinese defenders in fierce
machine gun lighting." Japanese did not occupy
the whole Chinese city, as implied, never even
reaching their origins] defense objective. To en
title the Chinese "defenders" somewhat glorifies
them. To say the Japanese did the engaging places
the fault with them, even though presumably they
were going in to restore order, and could hardly
be thought stupid enough deliberately to provoke
the Chinese directly under the eyes of the foreign
powers.
Possibly the only American newsman who sent
j home comprehensive, factual, and reasonably accurate
; reports what Hallett Abend (Stanford man, '03-"04) of
the New York Times, the caliber of which allowed him
i to be less sensational than his fellows. His lengthy
i dispatch covering this day of rumor and misinforma-
I tion notes especially the shift of sentiment at this
j time.
Chinese resistance had been so tenacious that Jap
-1 anese hopes of occupying the section in an houi' or
j two had been blasted. As the day progressed, the
! Japanese dropped GO bombs. The bombing scared Ihe
foreigners, and changed their erstwhile desire to see
j Japan teach China a lesson in regard to treatment of
j foreigners into a feeling that the Japanese were bullies.
This natural phenomenon of favoring the idea of
| action before it took place, but becoming horrified
i when things were actually blown up, infected all the
j correspondents. Only Abend was quick enough to
recognize the existence of his own and others' preju
dice and try to offset it. Even he admittedly found
| himself distressed by the "truculence" of Japan's
sailors, marines, and numerous semi-militarized civil—
\ ians.
Most accounts were distinctly anti-Japanese be
cause of the sentiment prevalent in Shanghai, the
j known distaste for Japan in America, and the more
melodramatic "war" stories which could be worked
up by using this "slant." When facts failed to fit
the case, they were omitted, enlarged, 6r snowed
under by strongly worded, colorful descriptions
j which were really opinion but were sent out as
' news.
Uncritical readers were given an impression of a
i big Jap ogre pouncing on poor Shanghai by such in
nuendo as "expertly, as though this campaign had
been carefully laid out in advance." How many read
'• ers stopped to remember unemotionally that all mod
-1 ern troop movements are minutely planned in advance.
Such references to the Japanese as "armed to the
teeth," and "the invaders came in two waves," further
a false effect, while staying within bounds of literal
i accuracy.
"Japs Raid American Mission," streamers of the
! 29th told the American public. The incident was ex
ceedingly minor, a few Japanese looking in the mission
, (probably for snipers) for anti-Japanese literature,
j according to the press acount. Thus "raid" was played
; up in the main stories, whereas Japanese assurances
i of non-interference with American and British rights
! in the international settlement were given less con
! spicuous spots.
"U. S. Fleet Ready for Action in the Orient" was
the type of headline designed to appeal to the Amer
; ican audience the next day. The 'permanent truce
| meeting' at the British Consulate found a little space
farther down. Stories of the news services neglected
to mention that the truce of 8 p.m. of the 29th was
broken by Chinese on the morning of the 30th.
New York Times accounts of this day were fair
enough to repeat Japanese announcements of re
luctance to open military operations in Shanghai
due to international complications, even though
Tokyo felt the landing parties adequate to cope
only with mobs, but not with the regulars in
street -fighting.
Defense agreements were openly violated on the
31st. Embittered by their repulse in Chapei, Japanese
J took over a nearby part of the settlement near the
center of town, ousting Municipal Council forces. This
! was meat for the news services.
At this time, the A.P. told us: "Goaded by the Japa
| nose invasion of Shanghai, the Chinese National Gov
ernmeot decided to declare war on Japan." Official
| announcement was not yet out, A.P. went on to say,
but since Chinese officials did not deny it, it must be so.
Beyond a doubt, Japan did use bad judgment, was
ruthless at times and destroyed much property. On the
| big opening day. the 29th, about 1000 Chinese (mostly
| civilians) are supposed to have been killed, and about
; a square mile of populous area razed by fires and
I bombs.
This does not, however, justify unfair news treat
i ment by American correspondents, nor omissions of
| vital facts, nor unnecessarily sensational and provoca
tive "play" by American papers.
Tomorrow, the concluding article will note a
few more points overlooked by the papers, rather
than attempt the near-impossible task of analyz
