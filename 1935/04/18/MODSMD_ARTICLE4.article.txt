Whew!
It was a nice stench, but it was a
stench.
Half of the packed reserve reading
room last Tuesday night suddenly
straightened up as one—and sniffed.
Into the ordinarily musty atmosphere
had crept a strong, penetrating
scent of something sickcningly
sweet. Perfume it must be.
A few unrestrained horse laughs
burst out. Burlesquish acts of be
ing gassed were dramatically put on
in various corners. Handkerchiefs
were tied around noses. If a hundred
roses had been brought into the
room the smell couldn't have been
si l onger.
And the cause of it all was one
lone Roble woman. Noses traced
her down. And she sat, calm and
serene, in the very ccntor of the
room with the fumes of what must
have been the contents of a full
bottle of perfumery rolling forth
from her person.
