GRAMMAR SCHOOL IDEAS
The Editor, Sir:
- I recently heard a Stanford pro
lessor lamenting the fact that stu
dents, fearful of being ctriled apple
polishers, seldom talked with him
after lecture hours. He expressed
himself as being very willing to talk
over matters of interest with stu
dents. Other professors feel the
same way.
It strikes me that we students are
missing a great opportunity in not
becoming more friendly with our
professors. It would seem much
more advantageous to "shoot the
breeze" with professors; in such a
session at least one person would
know what he was talking about.
We are letting our childish ideas
about apple-polishing interfere with
a chance to gain friendship and
knowledge. Until we rid ourselves
oi our grammar school ideas about
grades, we shall continue to lose one
of the best things college can offer.
Don Strauss
The Editor. Sir:
In regard to the letter of Boyd
w White in Tuesday's Daily, I sincerely
hope that I do not misrepresent his
■ statements by paraphrasing them as
; follows: "No circumstances justify
war"; i.e., nothing is worth fighting
for. This rather extreme statement
may justifiably come from a pros
pective martyr, but if it doesn't, we
: should like to point out "in contra
! diction the following facts:
1. Life, limb, and property are
i worth fighting for, as war could in
volve no more than the risk of los
! ing one or more of these. It may
be said that submission to an ag
j gressive foreign nation would not
! today, unlike various times in the
I past, involve the loss of these.
2. Even if this be granted, we con
! tend that justice before the law, and
i political and religious liberty are
i worth fighting for. At least good

and great men so believed, from
iTarquinius Collatinus to Woodrow
Wilson, including in transit greater
i men than either. We also contend
; that it may be that we shall have to
j fight for justice and liberty in our
itime. If Mr. White were on the Con
tinent, in Czecho-Slovakia, for in
stance, under the menace of Hitler's
Germany, I wonder if he would so
I eagerly counsel peaceful surrender.
I We agree that war is not to be en
! tered upon lightly or without great
I provocation, but we contend there
| are things worse than war and the
risk of death and destruction—those
j things being murder arid spoliation
:of the innocent, injustice, and tyr
! anny.

GRAMMAR SCHOOL IDEAS
The Editor, Sir:
- I recently heard a Stanford pro
lessor lamenting the fact that stu
dents, fearful of being ctriled apple
polishers, seldom talked with him
after lecture hours. He expressed
himself as being very willing to talk
over matters of interest with stu
dents. Other professors feel the
same way.
It strikes me that we students are
missing a great opportunity in not
becoming more friendly with our
professors. It would seem much
more advantageous to "shoot the
breeze" with professors; in such a
session at least one person would
know what he was talking about.
We are letting our childish ideas
about apple-polishing interfere with
a chance to gain friendship and
knowledge. Until we rid ourselves
oi our grammar school ideas about
grades, we shall continue to lose one
of the best things college can offer.

The Editor. Sir:
In regard to the letter of Boyd
w White in Tuesday's Daily, I sincerely
hope that I do not misrepresent his
■ statements by paraphrasing them as
; follows: "No circumstances justify
war"; i.e., nothing is worth fighting
for. This rather extreme statement
may justifiably come from a pros
pective martyr, but if it doesn't, we
: should like to point out "in contra
! diction the following facts:
1. Life, limb, and property are
i worth fighting for, as war could in
volve no more than the risk of los
! ing one or more of these. It may
be said that submission to an ag
j gressive foreign nation would not
! today, unlike various times in the
I past, involve the loss of these.
2. Even if this be granted, we con
! tend that justice before the law, and
