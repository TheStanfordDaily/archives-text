# Oil Paintings Alone Appeal To Authoress
## Gertrude Stein Returns To Talk of Art 
### Cedric Larson 
I A painting may be good or bad, or
1 neither, or both, or something else,
but unless it is painted in oil on a
flat surface it holds little interest
for Gertrude Stein, according to the
words of the stormy petrel of Amer
ican letters last night in her talk on
I that acephalous thing known as the
artwork of the future. She does not
i care for such types of painting as
! water colors or pastels.
Miss Stein contended that one of
the great difficulties with the way
! art is presented in America is the
J fact that people tend to look at all
] types of art with similar enjoyment.
I She holds a person cannot be gen
uinely and equally interested at once
jin music, theater, architecture, and
; painting.
j An oil painting, whether it is
I intended to look like something and
I looks like it, or docs not, makes no
difference to Gertrude Stein â€”it has
; achieved an existence and and for
1 itself by virtue simply of being done
j in oils on a flat surface.
Her first recollection of ana oil
paianting was a gigantic reproduc
; tion of the battle of Waterloo. "I
have always liked to look at. pic
tures of battle scenes," she said.
Some of the finer aesthetic prob
; lems of oil painting were discussed
at length: the relation of the pic
ture to the frame, "elegant" paint
ing, over-realistic painting, symbolic
, painting, and the Louvre with its
huge gilt frames. She dwelt on the
work of Cazin, Courbet, David,
| Daubigny, Matisse, Picasso, and
Cezanne.
Cezanne was her favorite. His
paintings move like landscape. His
: yellows and blues are landscape
yellows and blues. His people,
j chairs, and apples looked like peo
ple, chairs and apples. His pictures
were great because whether finished
or unfinished "everything was al
ways there" which goes to make up
| a good oil painting.
