TIIE EVILS OF
THESE DOPE SHEETS

Making out dope sheets fur track
meets is a most precarious proposi
tion. And it is more so in a fracas
like the Big Meet, where the stakes
are something more than three
cheers and the school song.
Show the guy who sits next to
you in class your dope sheet and
he'll invariably come up with some
thing like, "No,no, no. Don't pick
Dixon to win the mile. Fowler's go
ing to win both mile and two-mile,
'cause 1 know—went to high school
with him." It's not always as bad as
that, but there are so many things
that may happen from now till 3:30
Saturday afternoon that one team or
the other may win by 40 points, and
there go your dope-sheets.

SEVERAL EVENTS
OPEN FOIt UPSETS

DINK AND BRUTUS MAY
PULL FAST ONES

POSSIBLE BIG
TIME CHAMPIONS

First (jf all there are the come- ,
through performers. Fellows who j
aren't worth shucks in praelicc trot i
out a beautiful jump or throw, mak- !
ing great inroads into your dope. We j
might cite the example of Paul j
Zaches here last year. He was lucky
to jump 20 feet in practice, but in ;
the importartt meets there he was
out at 23.6. Experts caught on to j
him, however, and began to dope j
him in regardless. And there was :
Lloyd Schween who beat S.C. as a j
sophomore with a leap of 0-3, his !
"tops."
Saturday any number of these 1
surprises may hop up. The hurdles !
are open house, with four men ca- :
pable of winning each. Then the |
broad jump is wide open —some un- |
known may win it, for all we know
at present. Second and thirds in the |
high jump, pole vault, discus and '
javelin are also temporary no man's J
land. The dope-sheet favorites may :
do it, but they also may not.
Second upset chances are the |
"breaks." Remember last week at |
Berkeley when the leading Michi- j
gan two-miler broke his leg going
into the eighth and last lap.' Those j
1000-te-l chances are always just j
that —chances. A famous Bear soph- i
omore sprinter may come down with !
Blight's disease, too, and then Stan- j
ford would win the meet. i

Third is the complicated doubling
np of stars in two or more events.
Both Dink Templeton and Brutus
Hamilton have been called "old fox
es," and "wizards," and may spring
something uncalled for yet. Fowler's
running the mile is a possibility, or
Anderson in the 440, or Blackman
and Coe and Helmer in the 220 or
t.ny combination on the two relay
teams.
Fourth, and one to remember, is
the effect of psychology. If one team
comes through with a flash in the
first four events. —mile, 100, 440, and
javelin—it will tend to send the
spirit of that team on to victory,
while badly discouraging the other.
If Dixon and Nimmo take the mile,
and Voigt and Dean place in the
100, and if Blackman and Dellinger
come through in the quarter, the
Cards will be off on the right foot
to a win. It happened in the Little
Big Meet last year when Les Voor
hees of the Bears got all the breaks
and defeated the Card captain, Rusty
March, in the first event, the mile.
Immediately the Bears upset the
dope in every event and scored 88
points to win easily.

But besides deciding Big Meet
supremacy a lot will be learned
Saturday about what's going to
happen in the big intersectional
meets to come—the 1.C.4-A. and N.
C.A.A. especially.
If Sammy Klopstock, for instance,
can beat Moore, Wood, and Fish back
in the hurdles it will mean that the
Cards have an inside track on two
first places in the big meets, for men
from all over the country don't run
much faster than the four above
mentioned.
Then we will see how much of a
chance Brace, March, Nimmo and
Dixon will stand in the big leagues.
We already know about Fowler.
Hum Smith's showing will test his
skill in the high jump, and the same
goes for Levy, Reynolds, Mottram,
and Maugher. They are all possible
N.C.A.A. winners.

A recent investigation revealed
that 200,000 types of insects attack
trees.

If Dixon and Nimmo take the mile,
and Voigt and Dean place in the
100, and if Blackman and Dellinger
come through in the quarter, the
Cards will be off on the right foot
to a win. It happened in the Little
Big Meet last year when Les Voor
hees of the Bears got all the breaks
and defeated the Card captain, Rusty
March, in the first event, the mile.
Immediately the Bears upset the
dope in every event and scored 88
points to win easily.

But besides deciding Big Meet
supremacy a lot will be learned
Saturday about what's going to
happen in the big intersectional
meets to come—the 1.C.4-A. and N.
C.A.A. especially.
If Sammy Klopstock, for instance,
can beat Moore, Wood, and Fish back
in the hurdles it will mean that the
Cards have an inside track on two
first places in the big meets, for men
from all over the country don't run
much faster than the four above
mentioned.
Then we will see how much of a
chance Brace, March, Nimmo and
Dixon will stand in the big leagues.
We already know about Fowler.
Hum Smith's showing will test his
skill in the high jump, and the same
goes for Levy, Reynolds, Mottram,
and Maugher. They are all possible
N.C.A.A. winners.

A recent investigation revealed
that 200,000 types of insects attack
trees.
TIIE EVILS OF
THESE DOPE SHEETS

Making out dope sheets fur track
meets is a most precarious proposi
tion. And it is more so in a fracas
like the Big Meet, where the stakes
are something more than three
cheers and the school song.
Show the guy who sits next to
you in class your dope sheet and
he'll invariably come up with some
thing like, "No,no, no. Don't pick
Dixon to win the mile. Fowler's go
ing to win both mile and two-mile,
'cause 1 know—went to high school
with him." It's not always as bad as
that, but there are so many things
that may happen from now till 3:30
Saturday afternoon that one team or
the other may win by 40 points, and
there go your dope-sheets.

DINK AND BRUTUS MAY

POSSIBLE BIG
TIME CHAMPIONS

First (jf all there are the come- ,
through performers. Fellows who j
aren't worth shucks in praelicc trot i
out a beautiful jump or throw, mak- !
ing great inroads into your dope. We j
might cite the example of Paul j
Zaches here last year. He was lucky
to jump 20 feet in practice, but in ;
the importartt meets there he was
out at 23.6. Experts caught on to j
him, however, and began to dope j
him in regardless. And there was :
Lloyd Schween who beat S.C. as a j
sophomore with a leap of 0-3, his !
"tops."
Saturday any number of these 1
surprises may hop up. The hurdles !
are open house, with four men ca- :
pable of winning each. Then the |
broad jump is wide open —some un- |
known may win it, for all we know
at present. Second and thirds in the |
high jump, pole vault, discus and '
javelin are also temporary no man's J
land. The dope-sheet favorites may :
do it, but they also may not.
Second upset chances are the |
"breaks." Remember last week at |
Berkeley when the leading Michi- j
gan two-miler broke his leg going
into the eighth and last lap.' Those j
1000-te-l chances are always just j
that —chances. A famous Bear soph- i
omore sprinter may come down with !
Blight's disease, too, and then Stan- j
ford would win the meet. i

Third is the complicated doubling
np of stars in two or more events.
Both Dink Templeton and Brutus
Hamilton have been called "old fox
es," and "wizards," and may spring
something uncalled for yet. Fowler's
running the mile is a possibility, or
Anderson in the 440, or Blackman
and Coe and Helmer in the 220 or
t.ny combination on the two relay
teams.
Fourth, and one to remember, is
the effect of psychology. If one team
comes through with a flash in the
first four events. —mile, 100, 440, and
javelin—it will tend to send the
spirit of that team on to victory,

pable of winning each. Then the |
broad jump is wide open —some un- |
known may win it, for all we know
at present. Second and thirds in the |
high jump, pole vault, discus and '
javelin are also temporary no man's J
land. The dope-sheet favorites may :
do it, but they also may not.
Second upset chances are the |
"breaks." Remember last week at |
Berkeley when the leading Michi- j
gan two-miler broke his leg going
into the eighth and last lap.' Those j
1000-te-l chances are always just j
that —chances. A famous Bear soph- i
omore sprinter may come down with !
Blight's disease, too, and then Stan- j
ford would win the meet. i

Third is the complicated doubling
np of stars in two or more events.
Both Dink Templeton and Brutus
Hamilton have been called "old fox
es," and "wizards," and may spring
something uncalled for yet. Fowler's
running the mile is a possibility, or
Anderson in the 440, or Blackman
and Coe and Helmer in the 220 or
t.ny combination on the two relay
teams.
Fourth, and one to remember, is
the effect of psychology. If one team
comes through with a flash in the
first four events. —mile, 100, 440, and
javelin—it will tend to send the
spirit of that team on to victory,
while badly discouraging the other.
If Dixon and Nimmo take the mile,
and Voigt and Dean place in the
100, and if Blackman and Dellinger
come through in the quarter, the
Cards will be off on the right foot
to a win. It happened in the Little
Big Meet last year when Les Voor
hees of the Bears got all the breaks
and defeated the Card captain, Rusty
March, in the first event, the mile.
Immediately the Bears upset the
dope in every event and scored 88
points to win easily.

But besides deciding Big Meet
supremacy a lot will be learned
Saturday about what's going to
happen in the big intersectional
meets to come—the 1.C.4-A. and N.
C.A.A. especially.
If Sammy Klopstock, for instance,
can beat Moore, Wood, and Fish back
in the hurdles it will mean that the
Cards have an inside track on two
first places in the big meets, for men
from all over the country don't run
much faster than the four above
mentioned.
Then we will see how much of a
chance Brace, March, Nimmo and
Dixon will stand in the big leagues.
We already know about Fowler.
Hum Smith's showing will test his
skill in the high jump, and the same
goes for Levy, Reynolds, Mottram,
and Maugher. They are all possible
N.C.A.A. winners.

A recent investigation revealed
that 200,000 types of insects attack
trees.
TIIE EVILS OF
THESE DOPE SHEETS

Making out dope sheets fur track
meets is a most precarious proposi
tion. And it is more so in a fracas
like the Big Meet, where the stakes
are something more than three
cheers and the school song.
Show the guy who sits next to
you in class your dope sheet and
he'll invariably come up with some
thing like, "No,no, no. Don't pick
Dixon to win the mile. Fowler's go
ing to win both mile and two-mile,
'cause 1 know—went to high school
with him." It's not always as bad as
that, but there are so many things
that may happen from now till 3:30
Saturday afternoon that one team or
the other may win by 40 points, and
there go your dope-sheets.

SEVERAL EVENTS
OPEN FOIt UPSETS

DINK AND BRUTUS MAY
PULL FAST ONES

POSSIBLE BIG
TIME CHAMPIONS

First (jf all there are the come- ,
through performers. Fellows who j
aren't worth shucks in praelicc trot i
out a beautiful jump or throw, mak- !
ing great inroads into your dope. We j
might cite the example of Paul j
Zaches here last year. He was lucky
to jump 20 feet in practice, but in ;
the importartt meets there he was
out at 23.6. Experts caught on to j
him, however, and began to dope j
him in regardless. And there was :
Lloyd Schween who beat S.C. as a j
sophomore with a leap of 0-3, his !
"tops."
