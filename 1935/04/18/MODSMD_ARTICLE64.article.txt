# CARD POLO FOUR DEFEATS MENLO
## 
### 
Displaying power and teamwork j
which portends plenty of trouble for j
the invading Arizona mallet-wield
ers in next week's big series, Stan
ford's poloists rode through a Menlo
Junior College outfit yesterday to
win handily by the decisive score of
15 goals to 3. The game was a prac
tice affair scheduled in preparation
for a three-game championship series
next Monday, Wednesday, and Fri
day with a visiting University of
Arizona aggregation.
So easy did the game prove that
three of Lieutenant Grubbs' outfits
saw service at various stages of the
encounter. The Menlo. men were
good riders and powerful hitters,
though they were obviously no match
for the redshirts, whose playing has
shown marked improvement in re
cent games.
Captain Bill Rogers was all over
the field and when the dust had
cleared, the scoreboard showed five
goals for him in three chukkers of
play. Bob Fullerton garnered two
scores and Russ Rasmussen ac
counted for another varsity marker.
For the second Indian outfit Ed Mc-
Keon scored three beautiful goals,
Jim Henderson got two, while Bill
Enemark and John Dwyer each made
one. The third Card quintet failed
to score.
For the Menloites, Wallet scored
twice, and Free got a goal to com
plete the Jaysee scoring. Captain
Derby of Menlo also played good
polo at No. 2. â€¢
Tomorrow afternoon another con
test has been arranged by Lieutenant
Grubbs with a hard-hitting Black
Foxe Military Academy quartet. The
game is scheduled for 3 o'clock.
