# Win Over Bears Will Insure Indians Perfect Net Season
## 
### ROGER KIMBALL 
A perfect conference season will |
be the prize for Stanford's varsity
tennis team if it can defeat Califor
nia this afternoon at Berkeley. The
Indian-Bear matches are set for 2
o'clock, on the College Avenue j
courts.
California's racket wielders show
ed improvement in their 5-4 defeat
at the hands of U.S.C. Friday, and
should give the CarcLs more trouble
than they caused while losing all j
nine matches last month. Stanford
will be more heavily favored in the
doubles competition than in the
singles, and several of the two-man i
tilts may be close.
Law Plays Bennett
John Law of the Indians is sched
uled to play Dick Bennett of the
Golden Bears in the first singles
match. Stanford's Captain Sam Lee
and California's Paul Newton, an
other sophomore star, will probably !
tangle in the second affair, after .
holding top rank in most other
matches this season.
In the first Stanford-California
1J135 contests, Law trounced Don
White, now playing fourth sin
gles for the Bears, in straight sets, i
White took the measure of Phil
Wooledge, Trojan captain, last j
week, and still ranks three places
below Bennett. Law will have to
he in his best form to conquer
Bennett, who nearly defeated Dey
in the frosli matches last year.

• Lee may have his hands full in
playing Newton, who downed
U.S.C.'s Jack Knemeyer with ease.
The Bear soph is capable of top
notch tennis, and proved it in his
convincing win over Seward when
both were yearlings.
Dey Rates Edge
Ben Dey is a pronounced favorite
over California's footballing tennis
player, Perry Schwartz, in the third j
match. Both Stanford's Jack Lynch
and Trojan Vernon John have j
downed Schwartz in one-sided J
matches this season. Dey is rated
above Lynch and John.
While defeating Wooledge,
White proved that he has greatly
improved his game since a one
sided defeat by Law early in the
season. Seward must play near
his peak to be certain of a victory
over this California in the fourth
singles.
Playing in the fifth spot, Jack
Lynch of the Cards will meet the
Bears' Harper Massie, who also
won his match against the Trojans.
Massie proved that he has come a
i long way since he failed to take a
'game from Dey six weeks ago.
Sixth Match Toss-up
Bob Pommer of Stanford and
! George Tanaka of California will
i probably be the only two netmen to
play the same opponent when they
I repeat their sixth singles dispute.
1 Pommer won by a narrow margin

last month, but Tanaka is in a win
ning streak, and rates an even i
chance.
The first doubles match between
Cards Lee and Ponimer and
Bears Newton and Bennett is
doped as a toss-up. The Stanford 1
teams of Dey-Seward and Law- '
Lynch we conceded edges over
Schwartz - Captain Whitman and
White-Massie of the Bears.
Admission to the varsity matches,
moved up two days to make room j
for the Big Meet, will probably be i
25 cents with student body cards and
[40 cents general admission.

I repeat their sixth singles dispute.
1 Pommer won by a narrow margin

last month, but Tanaka is in a win
ning streak, and rates an even i
chance.
The first doubles match between
Cards Lee and Ponimer and
Bears Newton and Bennett is
doped as a toss-up. The Stanford 1
teams of Dey-Seward and Law- '
Lynch we conceded edges over
Schwartz - Captain Whitman and
White-Massie of the Bears.
Admission to the varsity matches,
moved up two days to make room j
for the Big Meet, will probably be i
25 cents with student body cards and
[40 cents general admission.
A perfect conference season will |
be the prize for Stanford's varsity
tennis team if it can defeat Califor
nia this afternoon at Berkeley. The
Indian-Bear matches are set for 2
o'clock, on the College Avenue j
courts.
California's racket wielders show
ed improvement in their 5-4 defeat
at the hands of U.S.C. Friday, and
should give the CarcLs more trouble
than they caused while losing all j
nine matches last month. Stanford
will be more heavily favored in the
doubles competition than in the
singles, and several of the two-man i
tilts may be close.
Law Plays Bennett
John Law of the Indians is sched
uled to play Dick Bennett of the
Golden Bears in the first singles
match. Stanford's Captain Sam Lee
and California's Paul Newton, an
other sophomore star, will probably !
tangle in the second affair, after .
holding top rank in most other
matches this season.
In the first Stanford-California
1J135 contests, Law trounced Don
White, now playing fourth sin
gles for the Bears, in straight sets, i
White took the measure of Phil
Wooledge, Trojan captain, last j
week, and still ranks three places
below Bennett. Law will have to
he in his best form to conquer
Bennett, who nearly defeated Dey
in the frosli matches last year.

• Lee may have his hands full in
playing Newton, who downed
U.S.C.'s Jack Knemeyer with ease.
The Bear soph is capable of top
notch tennis, and proved it in his
convincing win over Seward when
both were yearlings.
Dey Rates Edge
Ben Dey is a pronounced favorite
over California's footballing tennis
player, Perry Schwartz, in the third j
match. Both Stanford's Jack Lynch
and Trojan Vernon John have j
downed Schwartz in one-sided J
matches this season. Dey is rated
above Lynch and John.
While defeating Wooledge,
White proved that he has greatly
improved his game since a one
sided defeat by Law early in the
season. Seward must play near
his peak to be certain of a victory
over this California in the fourth
singles.
Playing in the fifth spot, Jack
Lynch of the Cards will meet the
Bears' Harper Massie, who also
won his match against the Trojans.
Massie proved that he has come a
i long way since he failed to take a
'game from Dey six weeks ago.
Sixth Match Toss-up
Bob Pommer of Stanford and
! George Tanaka of California will
i probably be the only two netmen to
