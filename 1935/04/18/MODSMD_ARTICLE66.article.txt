# Indian, Bear Ball Nines Meet for Second Game
## 
### 
Coach Harry Wolters' varsity nine '
will meet the California Bears for the I
| second time this season this after- 1
j noon on the sunken diamond.
\ Stan Anderson, ace right-hander ,
j and co-captain, will toil on the i
i mound in an attempt to stop tiie
| pennant rush of the Berkeley
Bears, and he will be supported by
! the usual line-up.
| Jf ever a team was keyed to the
utmost, the Cards are now. They
have been the butt of jokes in the
city papers and at the hands, or
tongues, of sarcastic bleacherites.
They have everything to gain, and
nothing but a ball game to lose. Cal
ifornia is now in the top spot and
nothing would be sweeter to the !
Indians than to prove that they can i
| play ball by toppling the Bear from ;
I his throne.
The infield, which has been any- J
j thing but steady so far this year, will
! have to play smart ball to keep the
Bears subdued. Ed Clark will get
l the call for short stop, with Howell
i Turner at second and Frank Tre
| maine at third.
j Gordy Mallatratt has been playing i
I steady ball in every game and has
j been getting his share of hits. Other
batters on the squad who may be :
\ relied upon to smack the old apple j
! on occasions include the outfield trio

"Bones" Hamilton, Ted Leidig, and \
Fred Heringer.
Mike Ferro will catch, and will
be supplied by Anderson and his
co-captain hurling inate. Heringer.
Both men have fast •• breaking
curves, a good change of pace, and
lots of speed and control.
