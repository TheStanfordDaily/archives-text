# Cardinals Flash Old Form for Dink as Big Meet Nears
## VOIGT, DIXON RUN FAST TIME; SMITH MAY STILL JUMP Reynolds, Levy, King, Have Some Good Throws 
### Warren Breed 
In their last hard workout before
the little rendezvous with California
Saturday the Cards went through a
series of time trials yesterday, the
results of which made Dink Temple
ton very, very happy.
Here's what the boys did yester
day:
Chuck Voigt ran a 100 in !).!). Ho
rune up from. 10.2 last week to 10
flat against U.C.L.A., and at that
rate looks like a good bet to beat
the ailing Mushy Pollock of Cal.
Ray Dean was right behind Voigt,
closing in fast after a poor start.
Dean also is now out of the injured
class, and is also in the running with
Pollock.
Dixon's Good Time
Warren Dixon ran three laps in
3.10. Giving him a 70 second fourth
lap, there is a 4.20 mile, probably
good enough to beat Cal's Bob
Heavey.
Truck Del linger ran a quarter in
50 flat. Truck never was a time
trial runner—he runs in the money
under pressure—so this time is es
pecially encouraging, and says he
might beat out Leek of Cal for sec
end place.
Sam Klopstock ran a flight of
highs in 14.8, and a (light of lows
in 24.5. A mere breeze, but show
ing that bis 14.(! and 2:1.(5 under
competition last Saturday was the
McCoy.
Reynolds Shows Class
Jim Reynolds put out three throws
of over 50 feet. This with sweat
clothes on, bearing out Templeton's
predictions for the big sophomore.
Phil Levy tossed the discus 158
feet.
Jack King followed with several
tosses over 150 feet.
Templeton still has the old ailing
list bugaboo to worry about. Here is
how they looked yesterday.
Captain A1 Blackman showed no
limp, looked like a well man as he
trotted around in a light workout.
George Tharp, who likes his
chances of a broad jump victory
Saturday, was out in a suit and con
fessed he felt as fit. as a day in
April. Tharp has done some real
jumping in his time, and he intends
to carry on the good work in Ber
keley.
Smith To Jump
Humbert Smith stili was favor
ing bis bad ankle, and did not
work out. Trainers believe bis
slight limp will be O.K. by Satur
day, but that he will not be able
to jump for a record.
Arne Anderson, who tied Tini
Ginn at a neat 13 feet against
U.C.L.A., did no vaulting, a ban
daged ankle preventing.
In this shape the Cards will go up
1o Berkeley, and in this shape they
expect to win.
Meanwhile at Berkeley the big to
do is over Mushy Pollock. Reports
say that the whole staff of doctors
and trainers have been working.on
him all week, and that they expect
him to run. His broad jumping,
however, is the subject of great
doubt.
