Attempting to do what no Stan
ford freshman baseball squad has
been able to do for the last seven
I years, the Indian frosh nine will
travel to Berkeley Saturday morn
ing in an endeavor to gain a victory
over the California yearlings, and
with it take the 1935 series. Stan
: ford last won the little series in
j 1927, and since that time has not
| been able to come through vic
' torious.
j The Card yearling nine, after a
i fairly bad early season record this
j year, has come into its own and has
| been going strong in its last several
I games. California gained the first
j victory in the 1935 series as a result
of an 11-inning game played two
weeks ago. Stanford came back
I strong last week, however, and eas
iily defeated the Bear Cubs behind
I the steady pitching of Spike Fur
man, who will be ready to pitch
again Saturday.
As a result of the game played
last week the Indian papooses will
probably be favorites to take the
j "rubber" game. The Card batters
I had no trouble in solving the deliv
eries of three Bear pitchers, and they
| banged out 11 hits. The Californians
j were much weaker at the bat and
i were held to seven scattered hits.
