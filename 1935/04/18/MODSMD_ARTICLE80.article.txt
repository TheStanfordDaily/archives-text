# LITTLE BIG MEET FINDS TWO TEAMS EQUAL IN POWER
## Ellington Picks Babe Squad To Win by 10 Points 
### Gordon Frost 
Invading historic old Angell Field
tomorrow afternoon at 3:15 o'clock,
California's strong squad of frosh
cinder pounders will nuiteh strides
with Stanford's yearlings in their
annual "Little Big Meet."
Paralleling the Big Meet of Sat
urday in uncertainness of outcome,
tomorrow's tilt rivals its "big broth
er" in the variance of dope scores
offered. California writers favor
their team to take Bill Ellington's
Stanford team by a good 10 points.
Ellington himself has doped his
squad to beat Cal by 10 points.
Relying on information gathered
by Don Liebendorfer, Stanford pub
licity manager, who made a trip io
Berkeley Tuesday to look over the
set-up, the writer believes that
Stanford will take California tomor
row by more than 10 points, although
such a statement must be made on
consideration of past performances
—hardly a true test since some men
break under heavy competition, and
others show better than before.
Cal Given Three Wins
But previous performances indi
cate that California should cop the
440 with their Branson Butler, whose
best time is 52.8 seconds. Along with
the half-mile goes the pole vault and
shot put as almost certain victories
for the Cubs. In every other field,
however, Stanford can be (favored
to win.
Jim Kneubuhl should capture the
century, Captain Edson Burrows the
mile, and Otto Beringer the discus.
All three of these events appear to
be in the bag for Stanford. Kneu
buhl's time exceeds that of Hampton
Pool, Cub ace sprinter, by two
tenths of a second, Burrows has ex
celled by a full second the 880 time
of Cal's undefeated Dan Carter, and
Beringer out-throws the best Bear
effort by 10 feet.
Madlem Improves
In the two-mile Stanford is the
heavy favorite since California frosh
have not run that event in a meet
this season. Rumors have been cir
culated, however, that the Berkeley
gang may be able to put an eight
lap man on the track who will give
Stanford's Jack Beman some com
petition.
Jim Kneubuhl is expected to have
some difficulty in taking John Dow

dakin in the 220. The latter has
turned in a time of 22.4 to Kneu
buhl's 22 flat, but repots indicate
that Dcwdakin has yet tc reach his
peak.
Broad Jump Favorite
Stanford's chances to place first
and third in the broad jump and 100
brightened yesterday whsn Leo
Madlem's strained muscle was re
ported to be healing rapidly. If Mad
lem's condition permits, and evi
dence Ls given that it will, Ellington
will probably run him in the anchor
lap of the relay as well as enter
him in the broad jump, where he
should place. In case Madlem docs

not run, Tom Collins will . print the
last 44j yards.
Collins, who should easily take the
broad jump has given proof that he
can lead the relay to th • tape if he
is called upon.
Grant Stone in the javelin, Cy
Oberg in the low hurdles, Hank
Luisetli in the high jump, anil Ken
Peters in the high sticks are up
against men of nearly equal caliber
from California. In every case, how
ever, the Ca'ds' past records show
them to bo a trifle better and unless
"Little Big Meet' competition proves
too great a strain can be counted
upon for victory.
