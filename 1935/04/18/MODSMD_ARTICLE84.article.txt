### 
With the approach of job-hunting
time for the many seniors who are to

Wrenn of the Vocational Guidance
Committee had reprinted an article
entitled "Jobs for College Men,"
written by R. S. Urhbrock who in
terviews thousands of college grad
uates as the research director of the
industrial relations division of the
Proctor and Gamble Company.
The article originally appeared in
"Occupations" of January, 1935, and
Dr. Wrenn thought the information
giyen in the article good enough to
be reprinted and distributed among
Stanford seniors. Fifty copies are
available in the information window
of the Registrar's office it 5 cents
per copy to cover cost of reprinting.
Some of the practical suggestions
given in the article are:
Success in getting jobs usually
rests upon a well-planned interview
with the employer. The student
should be fortified with sufficient in
formation concerning the firm he
wishes to enter.
The applicant's behavior during
the interview undergoes strict scru
tiny, and counts a great deal in mak
ing the final decision. To be able to
speak, freely and confidently, yet re
fraining from becoming too intimate
with the interviewer is good tech
nique in getting in the employer's
favor.
Men who stand on their own feet
are especially welcomed. Two
friends ordinarily should not go job
hunting together.
Writing letters of application is not
considered a satisfactory method of
applying for jobs.
Following directions in filling out
application blanks should be ad
hered to strictly and implicitly.
"Good scholarship, campus
achievement, early graduation, in
that order, are significant indices of
success in the Bell System."
