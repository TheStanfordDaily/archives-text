# STYLES DISPLAYED IN FASHION REVUE
## 
### 
The Daily Fashion Revue, held
yesterday afternoon in the Women's
Clubhouse, will probably become an
annual or semi-annual event, ac
cording to Charlotte Burridge, who
conducted the show.
Sport, street, and formal wear
from San Francisco and Palo Alto
stores was modeled by 14 women.
For both afternoon and evening,
black, navy blue, brown and aqua
marine, usually contrasted with
white or red were shown to be spring
style favorites. Afternoon modes
favored wool, knit, and crepe mate
rials, while net, lace, chiffon, and
organza predominated for evening
wear.
Background music was supplied
through the courtesy of Gordon
Heche and his orchestra. The event
was under the direction of Jane
Dodga.
