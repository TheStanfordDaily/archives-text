A. man who visited a Chesterfield
factory recently, saicl: r 'Now that I have
seen Chesterfields made, I understand
better than ever why people say Chester
fields are milder and have a better taste."
If you too could visit our factories you could
see the clean, airy surroundings; the employees
in their spotless uniforms, and the modern ciga
rette making machinery.
You could notice how carefully each Chester
field cigarette is inspected and see also how
Chesterfields are practically untouched by human
hands.
Whenever you happen to be in Richmond,Va.,
Durham, N. C., or San Francisco, California, wc
invite you to stop at the Liggett & Myers plants
and see how Chesterfields are made.
