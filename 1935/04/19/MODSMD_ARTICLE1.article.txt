# CARD DEBATERS PARTICIPATE IN SQUAD BATTLE
## Mellinkoff, Rogers Win Over McFarland, Bright In Informal Meet ROTH PICKS VICTORS Wit and Custard Pie Flash In Little Theater 
### 
Sparkling wil and humor, and a ;
custard pie, flashed across the Little
Theater .singe last night in an in
formal, benefit "family debate,"
which was won by Dave Mcllinkoff J
and Bill Rogers, the western team of
Stanford's transcontinental tour, over
the eastern team composed of Packey
McFanand and Andrew Bright, de
bating on the arms and munitions
question.
Choosing th<> winners on the basis j
of entertaining ability, audience con- (
tacl, good presentation of arguments, ;
and delivery, the judges' committee j
headed by Comptroller Almon Roth j
picked the victors by an 8-4 vote. ]
The decision sought to express the
cross-section opinion of the audi
ence by having in the judges' com- ,
mittee representatives from Palo j
Alto, the faculty, administration, and j
students.
Hit Arms Makers
Amidst a barrage of jokes and I
wise cracks, the affirmative team of I
Bright and McFarland were able to j
present in the arguments a plan in
volving an international definitive j
council which would define "arms
and munitions" and seek to enforce j
an embargo on them. Fomenting j
war scares and seeking customers [
regardless- of boundary lines, the I
arms manufacturers were under fire |
by the peace proponents who wanted I
the possibility of war less likely.
Rogers and Mellinkoff on the neg- j
ative opposed any embargo on the j
grounds that such an action would j
necessitate "unfair discrimination"!
against the smaller nations, and that ]
the proposed plan of the affirmative ,
does not eliminate the basic causes j
leading to war. Rogers contended !
that an embargo "makes the strong I
nations stronger, and the weak!
weaker."
Proceeds to Convalescent Home
All proceeds from the sale of the j
15 cent tickets went to the current j
Convalescent Ho r .ie Drive. Even the i
contest ct i"l 1 s themselves, as well as |
the judges and the chairman, were '
required to buy tickets so that every I
cent available could be given to the j
benefit of the little kiddies in the !
Home. Promotional expenses were'
borne by the Debate Council.
Debate Manager Bob Gros pre- |
sided as chairman of the evening, j
Following the clash, the four speak- \
ers were subject 10 questions asked j
from the floor.
By this victory, Rogers and Mel- i
linkoff uphold their title as winners!
of the Western Debate Champion
ship, an honor achieved last fall at j
Salt Lake Citv.
