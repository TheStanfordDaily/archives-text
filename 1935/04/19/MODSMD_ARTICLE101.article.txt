# Moloney Regrets End Of Old-Time Track Brawn
## 
### BOB EISENBACH 
In the days when titans ran the ■
cinder track—men who pulled out I
of pure muscle—a track meet was !
a test of endurance and the will to
win.
Today, when running has speeded
up with the times and track has be
come a science, not an art, divorced 1
from will power and married to
brains, trackmen are weighted to
their purpose, figuring their pace ,
and burning their fuel with the care
of trans-Atlantic flyers.
Harry Maloney's memory spans
the years between ancient and
modern tracksters. Me has seen
them both, and he finds it hard
to choose between tiie race-horse
of today and the steam engine of
yesterday.
His one sorrow is the passing of j
the all-round athlete. "We haven't
any move of the men who can do all
the decathlon feats and do them
well," he declared today, as Stanford
was preparing for her meet with Cal
on Saturday. "The great ones of the
past were athletes in the real sense
ol the word. Today we have special
ists, who restrict themselves not only
to one sports classification, but to
specific events, perfecting themselves
in one thing, remaining dubs in
everything else."
Whether the high records of mod- ;

• ern track compensate for (he loss of
Lhe versatile muscle-man of old is
: a question to Maloney. "I doubt if
the men are any better today than
they were in 1910," he said. "The
traekster of old was bigger and
stronger. Today's runner is built like
1 a racehorse, with a racehorse's nerv
ousness and irritability." The men
of 1910 were older, too, not imma
ture, and not so susceptible to over
strain."
The one big improvement Harry
I will admit is in the equipment.
"That's the important factor in
modern records," he believed . "To
run the quarter-mile in fifty sec
onds was the feat of a prodigy in
the old days. Such a feat usually
put a man in top-spot. Today, if
he does the same distance in the
same time, he's not in the running
at all."
Though the modern traekster may
be designed and trained for speed—
for pouring out his energy at the
crack of a gun—track men can and
do burn themselves out. "Regard
less of the statements of other
coaches, I beiieve that athletes are
not inexhaustible sources of energy,"
Maloney declared. "They can go to
pieces just as anyone or anything
' else strained beyond natural capa
' bilities.
