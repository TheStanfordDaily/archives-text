## 
### 
Watching from the Angell Field >
sidelines this afternoon when Stan
ford's little team of untried frosh 1
I truckmen clash with the California
yearlings will be a group cf veter
ans—men who can think back one,
two, or even three years to a day
when they wers shivering in their !
track shoes as uninitiated frosh.
1932 Squad Represented
A1 Blackmail will remember that
day in April of 1932 when his fresh- j
i man team took a 71-59 beating at ;
: the hands of Cal, despite his own ef
forts to garner victory. Blackmail
J was called "the most promising
i freshman runner since Ben East
• man" when he won the 220, ran the
| anchor lap of the victorious Card re- 1
1 lay, and finished a second to
Cal's sprinter in the century. Al's
time for his relay lap that day was
49.4.
With Blackman will be Johnny
Mottram, and the latter will recall
with some amusement his efforts to !
place third in that same Cal meet of j
I 1932. Mottram managed to heave the i
. javelin just over 170 feet—not good
I enough to place against Bill Beatty's
183-foot 5^4-inch winning throw.
Dave Devlin will recall that 10:30
two-mile he ran in with glee in j
1932. His nearest competitor and j
team-mate, Phil Merentin, dropped a
shoe on the sixth lap and came lop
ing home in second place still in his
j half-shod condition.

'33 There, Too
Members of the 1933 yearling
squad will be slightly more numer
ous. Chuck Nimmo will relive that
April day when, in spectacular fash
ion, he led hi.s team-mates home to
trounce the California frosh 71-59—
just the reverse of the previous
year's beating.
Nimmo cut six seconds off the
Little Big Meet mile run record and
then turned in another first in the
two mile. Chuck's mile time was
4:23.5. Sammy Klopstock did his
stuff on the same cfay by winning
both high and low hurdles', beating
out his team-mate, Hunt Kingsbury,
for the first time that season.
Monk Moscrip, Johnny Reisner,
and Bobby Grayson, who were
called the "sprinting frosh football
ers," did some fancy sprinting in
that 1933 meet, Moscrip taking the
century, and Reisner the 220, with
Grayson right on his heels.
Dollinger Scores First Win
Brewer "Truck" Dellinger won the
first race of his life that day. He led
Begnasacco of California to the tape
in 52.2 seconds. Calloway had the

be-t put in the shot, 43 feet 2V2
inches.
Last year the Bears romped all
I over the Stanford frosh, and several
I of those side-line spectators of this
1 afternoon's contest will remember
! their efforts to stave off the beating.
Rusty March, who was captain ihat
| year, will re-run his race against
California's Les Voorhees, whose
faster pace carried him across the
finish just a scant yard ahead. Jim
j Reynolds broke John Lyman's frosh
I shot heave by a fraction of an inch
to take one of the two firsts Stanford
j scored in that rout. Paul Green ac
> counted for the other by winning
: the quarter in 50.2.

1932 Squad Represented
A1 Blackmail will remember that
day in April of 1932 when his fresh- j
i man team took a 71-59 beating at ;
: the hands of Cal, despite his own ef
forts to garner victory. Blackmail
J was called "the most promising
i freshman runner since Ben East
• man" when he won the 220, ran the
| anchor lap of the victorious Card re- 1
1 lay, and finished a second to
Cal's sprinter in the century. Al's
time for his relay lap that day was
49.4.
With Blackman will be Johnny
Mottram, and the latter will recall
with some amusement his efforts to !
place third in that same Cal meet of j
I 1932. Mottram managed to heave the i
. javelin just over 170 feet—not good
I enough to place against Bill Beatty's
183-foot 5^4-inch winning throw.
Dave Devlin will recall that 10:30
two-mile he ran in with glee in j
1932. His nearest competitor and j
team-mate, Phil Merentin, dropped a
shoe on the sixth lap and came lop
ing home in second place still in his
j half-shod condition.

'33 There, Too
Members of the 1933 yearling
squad will be slightly more numer
ous. Chuck Nimmo will relive that
April day when, in spectacular fash
ion, he led hi.s team-mates home to
trounce the California frosh 71-59—
just the reverse of the previous
year's beating.
Nimmo cut six seconds off the
Little Big Meet mile run record and
then turned in another first in the
two mile. Chuck's mile time was
4:23.5. Sammy Klopstock did his
stuff on the same cfay by winning
both high and low hurdles', beating
out his team-mate, Hunt Kingsbury,
for the first time that season.
Monk Moscrip, Johnny Reisner,
and Bobby Grayson, who were
called the "sprinting frosh football
ers," did some fancy sprinting in
that 1933 meet, Moscrip taking the
century, and Reisner the 220, with
Grayson right on his heels.
Dollinger Scores First Win
Brewer "Truck" Dellinger won the
first race of his life that day. He led
