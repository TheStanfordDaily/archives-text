# Dink Hopes for Twelfth Consecutive Indian Win
## 
### 
Dink Templeton will be striving
for his twelfth consecutive Big Meet
victory tomorrow afternoon, when
his 1935 track and field team n eets
the California squr.d. Undoubtedly it
will be one of his toughest Big Meets
since 1924. when, after two defeats
and one tie, he gained his first vic
tory as coach over the Golden Bears.
Besides a Big Meet win, tomor
row's California - Stanford tussle
will mean another round in the
1 years of friendly rivalry between
i j < nipleion and California's Coach
Brutus Hamilton. The friendship
j started with the Olympic
Games, when Dink went to Ant
werp as a hroadjumper and ilam
i ilton as a decathlon entrant.
I Hamilton's coming out to the coast
three yeats ago meant that the bn
ter track rivalry between California
and Stanford was over. There is still
the same scramble for points; indeed,
'California's increased strength in the
. past two years has made the Indians
j work for each point, whereas the Big
Meet was regarded as a cinch several
years ago. But there is no "boxing"
on turns, no teaming up in the dis-
I tance races. Stanford's journey to
the California oval last Wednesday
] to become acquainted with the field
is unprecedented.
| Templeton's record, besides con
| secutive Big Meet wins, is well spot
ted with national championships in
the past few years. It includes the
coaching of such greats as Ben East
man, world's record holder in the
quarter-mile; John Lyman, world's
champion shot-putter for some ten
days last summer; Bill Miller, Olym
! pic Games pole vault champion in
1932; and such prominent weight
i men as Eric Krenz, Harlow Rothert,
i "Nellie" Gray, Here Laßorde, and
! Gordon Dunn.
