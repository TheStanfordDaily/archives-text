# J.C. TRANSFERS AID TRACKSTERS
## 
### 
Both the Stanford and California
; track teams meeting tomorrow in a
I crucial Big Meet have been consid-
I crably bolstered during the past year
by junior college transfers, and the
j benefits resulting are approximately
I equal.
j Stanford has found its discus de
j partment practically "lifted" from
j the San Mateo Junior College team
iol last year. Phil Levy and Jack
I King have placed one-two in most
i of Stanford's meets to date this sea
son, and are counted on for at least
| six points tomorrow.
San Mateo also gave generously to
I Stanford in the running events in
! Warren Dixon and Ray Dean. Dixon
| is slated for a first in the mile to
[ morrow, and with hi.s abundant ox
j perience gained during prep and
j jaysee days will be a sure point wip
j ner for another season. Dean, a 9.8
| sprinted and 23-foot broad jumper,
j has yet to best injuries, but should
j show tomorrow.
j Cal's hurdle trio was the presenta
l tion of Sacramento Junior College.
I Tom Moore now holds the California
j high hurdle record; Del Fishback
| has been equally successful in the
| lows; and John Wood has been pick
j ing up a generous share of seconds
| and thirds.
