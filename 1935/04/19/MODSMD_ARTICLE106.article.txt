# BABE NINE OUT FOR SERIES WIN
## 
### 
With the series victory within its
grasp, the Stanford ireshmaji base
ball nine will travel to California
tomorrow morning to meet the Bear
nine in ihe third and deciding game
of the 1935 "lithe series" to be
played at 10 o'clock on the Bear
diamond.
Not since 1927 has a Card yearling
nine been able to defeat the Bear
Cubs in the annual series played
between the two schools. This year,
after a slow start, the Indian lrosh
have snapped up their playing and
have been going in good shape for
the past several weeks.
The game tomorrow will be the
third between the two teams this
year, with each having gained one
win. California defeated the Card
freshmen in the first game two weeks
ago, winning out in the eleventh
inning after a tight game. The In
dians came back strong last week,
however, and easily slugged their
way to victory, chalking up eleven
hits off three California pitchers.
From the piaying of the two teams
in the last game, Coach Ernie Nev
ers' men will be slight favorites to
defeat the Cubs.
In practice this week Coach Nev
ers has concentrated on fielding, and
the Cards should put a good game
in- the field. The starting line-up for
the Indians will be the same as that
which started the last California
game. Spike Furman will handle the
pitching burden, with Glenn Hamil
ton catching. Hcrm Weiner, who de
feated the Cards in the first game of
the current series, will be the prob
able pitching choice of the Bears.
The Card lrosh had no trouble in
solving his delivery last Saturday.
