# FROSH TRACK HEAD HAS GOOD RECORD WITH CARD TEAMS
## 
### 
Bill Ellington is a familiar figure
out on the Angell field oval—cigar,
cane, Boy Scout hat and all. But
besides he is head coach of the frosh
track team, and right hand man to
varsity coach Dink Templeton.
His record, since he came to the
Farm in 1 1 j27, speaks weil for his J
capacity as coach. His frosh track i
teams have won the great majority j
of their meets, and have bov/ed lo the
California frosh only twice.
Turned Out Stars
From his yearling aggregations,
some of the greatest athletes America ;
has produced have advanced to Stan
ford track and field teams, including
Ben Eastman, Eric Krenz, John Ly- !
man, Harlow Rothert, Gus Meier, I
Nellie Grey, and, on the present var- I
sity, Sam Klopstock, Johnny Mot
tram, and Al Blackman.
Bill showed his mettle in 1932 j'
when he took over the varsity while ,
Dink was lying abed in the Lane
Hospital. He took the Cards through
a great season, and beat California
79-52.
Back in the '80's, when Bill was a
schooiboy, he was a crack half-miler
and pole vaulter. His tops in the
vault was 10-6—but that was when
the world record stood at an even
11 feet. A man six inches below the '
world's record nowadays is one of
the best.
All-Around Coach
Before he became a Stanford man
he coached in all parts of the state—
Sutter County, Chico State, Biggs,
Piedmont, and Kingsburg. He not
only coached track, but took charge
of all sports—football, baseball, and
basketball.
His work at Biggs was nothing
short of mircaculous. There were
exactly 28 boys at school there, but
he succeeded in turning out basket
ball teams that four times won
Northern California championships.
