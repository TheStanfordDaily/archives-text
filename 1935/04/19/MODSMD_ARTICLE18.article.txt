### 
SACRAMENTO, April 18 </R).— 1
Veto was written today by Governor j
Merriain across the Seawell-Powers
bill limiting the length of freight
trains to 70 cars and the action j
promptly called forth an angry i
threat of recall and a charge of lob- I
byist influence with the chief ex
ecutive.
In refusing to sign the bill, ap
proved in the Assembly, 55 to 24,
and in the Senate, 22 to 17, the Gov
ernor said he was motivated by the
fact that especial damage would be
done to agriculture and that to be
practical the legislation should be
national in •scope.
Incensed at the governor's action, i

Assemblyman Hunt. Los Angeles,
who led the fight for the bill in
the lower house, said he would go to
i Los Angeles tomorrow and put the
"full facts of this case before or
jganized labor."
j '"Under the law, a governor can
liiot be recalled until he has been in
office for at least six months," said
Hunt," but bright and early July 5
we will file a recall petition."
The assemblyman challenged th<
governor's "sincerity" toward labor
and added:
"Wo have hoard a lot of talk abou*
lobbyists this session. Th? lobbyist;
couldn't defeat the bill in eithei
house, but it is quite apparent the>
l go to Governor Merriam."
