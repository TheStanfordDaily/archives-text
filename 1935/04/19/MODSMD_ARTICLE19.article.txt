# Dopesters Puzzle Over Outlook for Big Meet; Frosh Vie Here Today
## Card Yearlings Given Edge In Bear Cub Tussle On Angell Field GUN SOUNDS AT 3:15 U.C. Slated To Take Three Events, Indians Nine 
### Gordon Frost 
This afternoon at 3:15 o'clock the
starting gun for the mile run will
crack over Angell Field and fresh
man track teams from California and |
Stanford will be off to their eleventh |
annual Little Big Meet. Admission !
has been set at 25 cents with A.S.S.U. !
cards, 40 cents to the general public. !
In nine meets out of thirteen, i
Coach Bill Ellington's Stanford frosh
have been victorious, and the dope ,
on this afternoon's affair points to a 1
tenth win—this time by a substan- !
tial margin of more than 10 points. !
Give Bears Three Events
Three events can be conceded to
California's cubs as almost certain j
victories for that squad: the 440-yard i
dash, the shot put, and the pole vault.
Stanford has victory within its •
grasp in nine other events and the (
remaining four contests are slated ;
to he fights to fhe finish.
Second and third places will be
the counting factors this afternoon
and Stanford's stock rose consider
ably yesterday in these fields when j
it was announced by trainer Leo
Mayer that Leo Madlem would be in !
good shape to perform. Madlem j'
pulled a muscle last Saturday and
some doubt was held as to the pos- j
sibility of his competing today in!
the broad jump, pole vault, 100-yard j
dash, and relay — four events in j
which he should take seconds or
thirds.
Dcrn Still Off Form
Miler John Dern has not been as j
fortunate with his injury, also re- j
ceived in last week's meet. Dern, j
who was expected to take a second j
in the mile and third in the eight
lap grind, has been having trouble
with a strained arch and recent re
ports indicate that the injury has
steadily been growing worse. It is I
doubtful that he will be able to run
in usual form.
In all oth9r fields the Indian year
lings are said to be in tip-top shape. !
Jim Kneubuhl's illness of a few
weeks ago appears to have taken
nothing off his century form, and
Guy Hagerty reports that his recent i
touch of flu is not going to hold down ,
his 440 time.
Records May Be Shattered
In several events spectators have
reason to expected record times. Jim
Kneubuhl, who has turned in times
of 9.7 and U.B at his home in Samoa, |
can be expected to run under 10 flat. |
Jim says that the cold weather both- I
ers his running here, wishes that |
the tropical sun might appear to!
warm up his muscles for the 100
and 220-yard dashes today.
Edson Burows should turn in
fast times for the 880 and mile and j
if pushed in the latter event may '
set a new Little Big Meet record. !
Several man-to-man duels appear I
in the offing to decide the four most \
doubtful events. Cy Oberg and Kent j
Weaver are prepared to battle it out !
for the low hurdles victory. Both 1
men turned in times of 25.2 last j
