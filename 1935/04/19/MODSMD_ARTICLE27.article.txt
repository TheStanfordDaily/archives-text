# Anderson, Klopstock Slated To Match Points In Sprints, Hurdles
## BLACKMAN IS IN SHAPE Broad Jump Considered Most Crucial Event 
### Warren Breed 
A big, nebulous question mark
hangs over Edwards fiield on Ban
croft Way, Berkeley. For there
track teams from Stanford and Cali
fornia will battle out their Big Meet
tomorrow afternoon. And no one
knows who will win.
Dope sheets arc deadlocked. For
both teams this is unusual. Stan
ford, in past years, lias merely
romped through the Bears. But
Brutus Hamilton and an alert
alumni system have changed all
that. Stanford enters the meet as
underdog, if, indeed, there is any
difference between the teams.
California has its George Ander
son, who has the upper hand in both
sprints. His ten points should be
matched by Sammy Klopstock, who
has it in him to win both hurdles for
Stanford.
California, with Anderson in the
sprints, as well as Pollock, who has
been injured, expects to gather most
of its points in the flat races. Stan
ford's strength comes in the weights,
jumps, and hurdles.
Reports last night had A1 Black
mail, Card captain and quarter
milcr, as fit and ready to go. His
sprained ankle has ceased to
bother.
Humbert Smith, however, is still
not certain of being in his usual
form. His ankle, injured Sunday in
the pit, still causes him to limp about,
and he will not take any chances with
it until meet time tomorrow.
Pollock's Condition Unchanged
Up in Berkeley no change is re
ported with the condition of little
Morris Pollock, whose leg injury may
keep him out of both sprints and thi
broad jump. This lit* 1« mite can
sway 11 meet points to either side of
the ledger, depending on what, he
is allowed to enter. His coach, Bru
tus Hamilton, will not sacrifice the
health of his man for points.
Both coachcs consider the broad
jump as the crucial event Every
