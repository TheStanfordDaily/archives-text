# Anderson, Klopstock Slated To Match Points In Sprints, Hurdles
## BLACKMAN IS IN SHAPE Broad Jump Considered Most Crucial Event 
### Warren Breed 
A big, nebulous question mark
hangs over Edwards fiield on Ban
croft Way, Berkeley. For there
track teams from Stanford and Cali
fornia will battle out their Big Meet
tomorrow afternoon. And no one
knows who will win.
Dope sheets arc deadlocked. For
both teams this is unusual. Stan
ford, in past years, lias merely
romped through the Bears. But
Brutus Hamilton and an alert
alumni system have changed all
that. Stanford enters the meet as
underdog, if, indeed, there is any
difference between the teams.
California has its George Ander
son, who has the upper hand in both
sprints. His ten points should be
matched by Sammy Klopstock, who
has it in him to win both hurdles for
Stanford.
California, with Anderson in the
sprints, as well as Pollock, who has
been injured, expects to gather most
of its points in the flat races. Stan
ford's strength comes in the weights,
jumps, and hurdles.
Reports last night had A1 Black
mail, Card captain and quarter
milcr, as fit and ready to go. His
sprained ankle has ceased to
bother.
Humbert Smith, however, is still
not certain of being in his usual
form. His ankle, injured Sunday in
the pit, still causes him to limp about,
and he will not take any chances with
it until meet time tomorrow.
Pollock's Condition Unchanged
Up in Berkeley no change is re
ported with the condition of little
Morris Pollock, whose leg injury may
keep him out of both sprints and thi
broad jump. This lit* 1« mite can
sway 11 meet points to either side of
the ledger, depending on what, he
is allowed to enter. His coach, Bru
tus Hamilton, will not sacrifice the
health of his man for points.
Both coachcs consider the broad
jump as the crucial event Every
entry is handicapped by injuries
or inexperience of some sort or
other, and neither coach knows the
abilities of his men under fire.
Those nine points are destined to
look like ninety at about 3:30 in
the afternoon.
Both the 880 and the mile are also
open to upset. Dixon and Nimmo of
the Indians meet Bob Heavey of the
Bears in the four-lap curtain raiser.
The lanky Heavey has better time
this year than the Cardinal pair, but
experts are saying that the latter two
will come abreast of Heavey on the
turn and nip him at the tape.
In the half, Cal's Dick Brace has
a whole second faster time than
Rusty March, the Stanford best bet.
Brace is one of the most consistent
runners on the Coast, but Rusty.has
a chance in that he has yet to be
tested under favorable conditions in
a fast half-mile.
Discus a Toss-up
Then there is the discus. Berkeley
adherents are backing their big
sophomore, Glenn Randell, to beat
out Phil Levy for the five points.
Jack King of Stanford seems to have
the inside lane for the one point.
Stanford plans to score five in the
shot, with Jim Reynolds, sophomore,
the favorite, and George Mackey and
Dave Meek of California following.
Harder to dope are the javelin and
the pole vault. Stanford's first class
time in winning against U.C.L.A.
last Saturday gives them the edge in
the relay.
The opening event, the mile run,
will get the gun at 2 o'clock and Ed
wards Field, in Berkeley, is the place.

that. Stanford enters the meet as
underdog, if, indeed, there is any
difference between the teams.
California has its George Ander
son, who has the upper hand in both
sprints. His ten points should be
matched by Sammy Klopstock, who
has it in him to win both hurdles for
Stanford.
California, with Anderson in the
sprints, as well as Pollock, who has
been injured, expects to gather most
of its points in the flat races. Stan
ford's strength comes in the weights,
jumps, and hurdles.
Reports last night had A1 Black
mail, Card captain and quarter
milcr, as fit and ready to go. His
sprained ankle has ceased to
bother.
Humbert Smith, however, is still
not certain of being in his usual
form. His ankle, injured Sunday in
the pit, still causes him to limp about,
and he will not take any chances with
it until meet time tomorrow.
Pollock's Condition Unchanged
Up in Berkeley no change is re
ported with the condition of little
Morris Pollock, whose leg injury may
keep him out of both sprints and thi
broad jump. This lit* 1« mite can
sway 11 meet points to either side of
the ledger, depending on what, he
is allowed to enter. His coach, Bru
tus Hamilton, will not sacrifice the
health of his man for points.
Both coachcs consider the broad
jump as the crucial event Every
entry is handicapped by injuries
or inexperience of some sort or
other, and neither coach knows the
abilities of his men under fire.
Those nine points are destined to
look like ninety at about 3:30 in
the afternoon.
Both the 880 and the mile are also
open to upset. Dixon and Nimmo of
the Indians meet Bob Heavey of the
Bears in the four-lap curtain raiser.
The lanky Heavey has better time
this year than the Cardinal pair, but
experts are saying that the latter two
will come abreast of Heavey on the
turn and nip him at the tape.
In the half, Cal's Dick Brace has
a whole second faster time than
Rusty March, the Stanford best bet.
Brace is one of the most consistent
runners on the Coast, but Rusty.has
a chance in that he has yet to be
tested under favorable conditions in
a fast half-mile.
Discus a Toss-up
Then there is the discus. Berkeley
adherents are backing their big
sophomore, Glenn Randell, to beat
out Phil Levy for the five points.
Jack King of Stanford seems to have
the inside lane for the one point.
Stanford plans to score five in the
shot, with Jim Reynolds, sophomore,
the favorite, and George Mackey and
Dave Meek of California following.
Harder to dope are the javelin and
the pole vault. Stanford's first class
time in winning against U.C.L.A.
last Saturday gives them the edge in
the relay.
The opening event, the mile run,
will get the gun at 2 o'clock and Ed
wards Field, in Berkeley, is the place.
A big, nebulous question mark
hangs over Edwards fiield on Ban
croft Way, Berkeley. For there
track teams from Stanford and Cali
fornia will battle out their Big Meet
tomorrow afternoon. And no one
knows who will win.
Dope sheets arc deadlocked. For
both teams this is unusual. Stan
ford, in past years, lias merely
romped through the Bears. But
Brutus Hamilton and an alert
alumni system have changed all
that. Stanford enters the meet as
underdog, if, indeed, there is any
difference between the teams.
