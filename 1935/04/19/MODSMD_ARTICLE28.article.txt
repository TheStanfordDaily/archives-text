# Release Plans For Bean Day
## 
### 
Adhering strictly to an all bean
1 diet, campus eating organizations
I will celebrate the annual Bean Day
for the Convalescent Home Drive at
the mid-day meal on Monday,
'April 29.
"That plenty of beans will be on
j hand for all" was the statement
made by Bean Day committee head
Wally Brooke. Conscriptions of
beans were given to the extent of
1 1000 pounds by King City merchants.
To offset the monotony, a 2500-
j pound gift of apples is expected from
I Watsonville.
A suggested menu for the meal in-
S eludes: a big dish of beans, fruit
; punch, bread and butter, and apples.
The Union, Roble, Lagunita, Encina,
eating clubs, and fraternity houses
[will partake of the limited rations.
| Meals under this plan will cost be
! tween 6 and 8 cents per plate against
the regular 35 cents. The difference
will go to the Home.
With the administration's sanc
j tion, restaurants in Palo Alto will be
: included.
