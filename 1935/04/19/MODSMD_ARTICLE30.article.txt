# When Stanford Defeated the Bears in Baseball
## 
### 
They said that it couldn't he done. That the
Slumlord baseball team was ;i protitahle or
ganization to het on from the standpoint ol
errors 1 hey could make.
I>i!t yesterday afternoon, they were just
good enough to win the game they most
wanted to win, against the (lolden Hear. The
linal scoi'e read eight to six, and the lew hun
dred perspiring fans who went over to the
sunken diamond just because they might see
a game between two traditional enemies,
remained to cheer a lighting Indian nine.
doing into the fourth inning with the score
two to one for the Hears, the Stanford team
started a scoring spree with two outs against
them, and went on to hat in seven runs. Fven
the campus cynics who came for a sun bath
v.cre on their feet when the inning ended
with the score eight to two.
Ami so although the Stanford team still may
remain in the cellar, and although they may
still have more errors against them than an
antique adding machine, they are still good
enough to play winning hall against a Cali
fornia team. And perhaps thai is an omen for
tomorrow's track meet.
