# The 						Legislature Kills Another Bill
## 
### 
Red-bailers in the legislature, always fear-
I,ill <»I communism on I lit* stale's campuses,
have spent tlie week cracking down on their
arch enemies.
Killed in committee was a hill which would
have stricken out the law under which school
teachers may he discharged for utterances or
acts supporting criminal syndicalism. Sent
tu President Sproul of the I'niversity of Cali
fornia was a telegram denouncing the action
of eighteen professors at Berkeley who ex
pressed opposition to planned anti-communist
hills at Sacramento.
The professors said the proposed hills were
a "dangerous invasion of intellectual liberties
and entirely unnecessary and un-American."
Red-bailers at the stale's capitol expect to
suppress communism hy laws. A look at liis
lory and the prohibition experiment fails to
discourage them. They seem to forget that
they are passing laws for human beings who
are much more easily persuaded by reason
I ban by law.
When the legislators realize that their great
est weapons against the Red menace are work
able, plausible plans to adapt capitalism to
the present day's changing needs and thus dis
prove communistic schemes, California's cam
puses will breathe a sigh of relief.
