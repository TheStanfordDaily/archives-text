# Sunday Nights in the Library
## 
### 
To those of us not entapgled with sorority
Sunday suppers and other pleasant diversions,
Sunday nights are ideal times to polish oil a
little studying. Often a whole week's reading
may he done in advance at that time, perhaps
the last week's assignments caught up.
Midquarters are not far off, sad thought,
and a very large slice of the Farm's popula
tion would be heartily pleased if the reference
and reserve rooms were kept open Sunday
nights in addition to the afternoon period.
Response by those who administer that in
stitution's heating facilities was most* grati
fying, and perhaps the Sabbath suggestion
may he followed, with resulting quantities of
gratitude from those who lind studying a
necessary activity.
