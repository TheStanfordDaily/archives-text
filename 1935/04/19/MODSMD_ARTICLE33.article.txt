# Backing Up the Government
## 
### 
Coincident with indictments of the present
national administration from various sources,
there has arisen a great wailing from the ramp
ol the backers of the status quo. "Leave them
alone, is the h;iltle cry of that shocked group.
"We should all hack them to the limit; they're
running things."
True, there is :i certain degree of co-opera
tion necessary if a government is to mean
anything. To stand behind the leaders of the
people is particularly imperative during times
ol stress, when the utmost co-operation is
needed to maintain national credit, all'ord em
ployment at decent wages, and hreak the dead
lock of fear which grips the people.
These principles are excellent, and they
were carried out with a never-equaled zeal
when the country needed optimism to pull
it out of the depths of depression.
However, critics of the administration, even
those who denounce it at the present time, do
not with a purely malicious motive, as some
would have us helieve. The right of the indi
vidual to criticize the government and its ac
tions is a fundamental principle of democracy,
and as such must he preserved. I'nlold graft,
inelliciency, and unsound action would p;iss
by unnoticed if there were not the ever-present
balance wheel ot public opinion and comment
to check it.
Let the present government and those to
follow make sure that their actions are above
criticism before they begin to squirm and com
plain when the spotlight of opinion falls upon
t hem.
