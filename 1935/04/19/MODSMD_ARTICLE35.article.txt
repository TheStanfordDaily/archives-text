### JOHN L. KLINE 
HOiVSOCOME AND CONCLUSION
A.sking world assistance on the 31.st of January,
1932, the Chinese complained of "continuous indis
criminate bombing over which 20 Japanese military
bombers" (there were six) and the "scourge of ter
rific artillery fire." Since the only artillery used the
previous d c »y was that of the Chinese in violation of
the truce, too much trust can scarcely be put in the
good faith of China.
Japan could scarcely be expected to trust China
very much, after the long record ol Chinese trick
ery and treaty-breaking which they had met. The
mayor's ultimatum saying he would repress the
boycott societies had not been strongly worded lor
fear of Chinese mob reaction and had meant little
to the Japanese.
Made bitter by the long sufferings of their na
tionals in Shanghai and by the sniping and repulse in
Chapei, it is not too be wondered at that the Japanese
did not treat the Chinese gently in the following occu
pation and clean-up campaign. It i.s fairly well authen
ticated that Japanese turned machine-guns loose a
bit too promiscuously on refugee-crowded streets in
the part of the settlement their control on the
31st.
Nevertheless, the American press can scarcely jus
tify itself for its inaccui'acies, half-truths, and glaring
omissions. Never telling why the Japanese did as they
I did, the press was only 100 glad to have the blood-and
| thunder stories of the "night pf horror" and to blame
| the Japs in such roundabout ways as "the fighting
| started when the Japanese arrived."
Nowhere in this country's press could be found
a statement as fair and as realistic as that made by
Viscount Kothermere in the Sunday Dispatch
(English). He pointed out, "In protecting her own
people, she (Jipaif) is doing no more than ttritain
has been forced to do on numerous occasions."
As close as the A.P. ever came to admitting the
Japanese were in a section in which they belonged was
in a small paragraph in the third day's dispatches, as
j follows: "Japan's armed forced were in supreme com-
I mand of what is known as the Japanese section con
sisting of Hongkew and Mayside districts."
When a committee of resident diplomats backed by
the League was about to investigate the Shanghai
controversy, the A.P. said the investigation was to be of
i the "Japanese invasion of Shanghai." The inquiry
| move was "met by the Japanese delegation with an
I unexpected show of conciliation and desire to co
: operate in bringing about a peaceful solution." Such
! a statement must be viewed critically. It was not
| "unexpected" by anyone who knew the facts under
| lying the trouble; it was merely "unexpected" by the
j Associated Press, which, as a news-gathering agency,
j should have kept its opinions to itself.
Later, much w.-\s made of the various troop
maneuvers .as Japan sent over more men, finally
having about 50,000 in early March when the last
j of the Chinese troops were cleared out by a large
scale movement over the countryside. Little was
made, however, of the report of the League of
Nations' Committee report which came later ,*». nd
showed the Japanese to be much less in the wrong
than our earlier news stories would lead us to
suspect.
Unfortunately, newspapers are overly-interested in
| getting "spot news," timely news, exciting news, and
are less concerned with admitting their mistakes later
1 on when the mote prosaic factual material comes to
j light. Follow-up apology stories, obviously, do not
j have the mass appeal and selling qualities of sensa
| tional stories of the moment.
A week, a month, a year later, the news is dead,
and the best the newspapers can do—if they are
particularly honest—is to run a correction story
in a smr\ll place somewhere in the back pages.
After all, the newspapers arc but human, and arc
subject to human failings, so we should not criti
cize them too harshly. What we should do is to
read critically important foreign news—and local
items, too, for that matter.
Meanwhile, Shanghai "seethes with wild disorder"
and is "filled with apprehension." Not that the A.P.
I is to be considered altogether unreliable because of
their inadequate and unfair work in this instance.
J Some of their accounts were fair in parts. Also, it
| must be remembered that local papers receiving wire
i services are not bound to use all "copy," only that
| which suits their needs. Further, local papers put
; their own heads and streamers over articles and often
i make them appear worse than they are. Yet, the A.P.
; gave them plenty of material on which to write scare-
I heads.
Lest the reader think this article is only dealing
with isolated cases of an extreme degree, let it be
said that nearly all quotations in these articles are
from the Associated Press, most widely used of all
American news services. The headlines quoted are
not from a big metropolitan daily even, but from a
conservative paper of 11,000 circulation in a sub
urb. and were written upon the basis of A.P. stories.
How Mr. Hearst and some of his equally sensation
loving competitors "played" the news, we leave
the reader to gucs«.
In conclusion, let us remember firstly that in news
J storie.s about matters little understood and places the
geography of which is unfamiliar (as exemplified by
1 China) to both reader and headline-writer, a clever
correspondent or reporter can pull the wool over our
j eyes quite neatly.
Secondly, let us bear in mind before becoming
! righteously indignant about foreign matters which we
little comprehend that the U.S.A. may quite possibly
do the same sort of things, only we consider them to

HOiVSOCOME AND CONCLUSION
A.sking world assistance on the 31.st of January,
1932, the Chinese complained of "continuous indis
criminate bombing over which 20 Japanese military
bombers" (there were six) and the "scourge of ter
rific artillery fire." Since the only artillery used the
previous d c »y was that of the Chinese in violation of
the truce, too much trust can scarcely be put in the
good faith of China.
Japan could scarcely be expected to trust China
very much, after the long record ol Chinese trick
ery and treaty-breaking which they had met. The
mayor's ultimatum saying he would repress the
boycott societies had not been strongly worded lor
fear of Chinese mob reaction and had meant little
to the Japanese.
Made bitter by the long sufferings of their na
tionals in Shanghai and by the sniping and repulse in
Chapei, it is not too be wondered at that the Japanese
did not treat the Chinese gently in the following occu
pation and clean-up campaign. It i.s fairly well authen
ticated that Japanese turned machine-guns loose a
bit too promiscuously on refugee-crowded streets in
the part of the settlement their control on the
31st.
Nevertheless, the American press can scarcely jus
tify itself for its inaccui'acies, half-truths, and glaring
omissions. Never telling why the Japanese did as they
I did, the press was only 100 glad to have the blood-and
| thunder stories of the "night pf horror" and to blame
| the Japs in such roundabout ways as "the fighting
| started when the Japanese arrived."
Nowhere in this country's press could be found
a statement as fair and as realistic as that made by
Viscount Kothermere in the Sunday Dispatch
(English). He pointed out, "In protecting her own
people, she (Jipaif) is doing no more than ttritain
has been forced to do on numerous occasions."
As close as the A.P. ever came to admitting the
Japanese were in a section in which they belonged was
in a small paragraph in the third day's dispatches, as
j follows: "Japan's armed forced were in supreme com-
I mand of what is known as the Japanese section con
sisting of Hongkew and Mayside districts."
When a committee of resident diplomats backed by
the League was about to investigate the Shanghai
controversy, the A.P. said the investigation was to be of
i the "Japanese invasion of Shanghai." The inquiry
| move was "met by the Japanese delegation with an
I unexpected show of conciliation and desire to co
: operate in bringing about a peaceful solution." Such
! a statement must be viewed critically. It was not
| "unexpected" by anyone who knew the facts under
| lying the trouble; it was merely "unexpected" by the
j Associated Press, which, as a news-gathering agency,
j should have kept its opinions to itself.
Later, much w.-\s made of the various troop
maneuvers .as Japan sent over more men, finally
having about 50,000 in early March when the last

previous d c »y was that of the Chinese in violation of
the truce, too much trust can scarcely be put in the
good faith of China.
Japan could scarcely be expected to trust China
very much, after the long record ol Chinese trick
ery and treaty-breaking which they had met. The
mayor's ultimatum saying he would repress the
boycott societies had not been strongly worded lor
fear of Chinese mob reaction and had meant little
to the Japanese.
Made bitter by the long sufferings of their na
tionals in Shanghai and by the sniping and repulse in
Chapei, it is not too be wondered at that the Japanese
did not treat the Chinese gently in the following occu
pation and clean-up campaign. It i.s fairly well authen
ticated that Japanese turned machine-guns loose a
bit too promiscuously on refugee-crowded streets in
the part of the settlement their control on the
31st.
Nevertheless, the American press can scarcely jus
tify itself for its inaccui'acies, half-truths, and glaring
omissions. Never telling why the Japanese did as they
I did, the press was only 100 glad to have the blood-and
| thunder stories of the "night pf horror" and to blame
| the Japs in such roundabout ways as "the fighting
| started when the Japanese arrived."
Nowhere in this country's press could be found
a statement as fair and as realistic as that made by
Viscount Kothermere in the Sunday Dispatch
(English). He pointed out, "In protecting her own
people, she (Jipaif) is doing no more than ttritain
has been forced to do on numerous occasions."
As close as the A.P. ever came to admitting the
Japanese were in a section in which they belonged was
in a small paragraph in the third day's dispatches, as
j follows: "Japan's armed forced were in supreme com-
I mand of what is known as the Japanese section con
sisting of Hongkew and Mayside districts."
When a committee of resident diplomats backed by
the League was about to investigate the Shanghai
controversy, the A.P. said the investigation was to be of
i the "Japanese invasion of Shanghai." The inquiry
