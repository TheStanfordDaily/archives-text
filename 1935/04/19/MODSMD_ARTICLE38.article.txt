# BULL SESSION

From the patriotic union of the I
D.A.R. and the American Legion has '
sprung a yowling child. In tone loud
and 100 per cent, it screams that j
everyone—especially school teachers \
—should take an oath of allegiance— |
to the State Constitution, to the Fed
eral Constitution, to the Declaration
of Independence. •
Presumably it is dangerous for a >
mathematician to teach the Pytha
gorean theorem unless he believes
that the state legislature shouid meet
in bifurcated sessions, that the fed
eral government should have a bi
cameral legislature, and that it is the
duty of a people to "throw oft" their
government when it becomes abu
sive (see Declaration of Independ
ence, July 4, 1776).
Yet there are many persons, prob- \
ably entitled to live and even to
teach (in their own particular fields),
who think that "bifurcated" refers to
a chemical compound, who think that
"bicameral" refers to a double- I
lensed kodak, and who believe that
"to throw off a government" is the 1
utterance of a red organization.
It is a bit difficult to understand
how a person's intellectual beliefs I
should disqualify him from active
service in the teaching profession.
II beliefs were of real importance in
this regard, it would obviously be
more important to eliminate the man
who disbelieved in the Law of Grav- j
ity than in the Law of the Constitu- |

tion. But as long as the man who
disbelieved the Law of Gravity con
tinued to walk on the ground, and
as long as the man who disbelieved
in the Law of the Constitution con
tinued to remain a good citizen, both
would probably be satisfactory ped
agogues.
The spirit of American democracy
runs directly counter to attempts to
make belief or disbelief of any dog
ma a qualification for the holding of
any office. It is one of the blessings
of this nation that an individual can
hold to any religion, to any strange
cultism, to vegetarianism, or to any
thing else—and still remain among
the free and the equal.
Aside from the fact that the plea
for "oaths of allegiance" is un-
American (in the better sense), it is
obviously impossible to tell what a
man actually believes. It is impos
sible to tell, for instance, that the
man who preaches "preservation of
the home" does not have designs on
his next-door-neighbor's wife, or
that the man who once talked pro
hibition was not a secret sot, or that
the person who waves the flag most
vigorously is not that flag's worst
enemy.
The pledge places a premium on
hypocrisy, is untrue to the doctrines
which it professes to uphold, and but
serves as a handle for the public
parading of "subversive jingoism."
