# POWERFUL SQUADS LIKELY TO BREAK BIG MEET RECORDS
## Nimmo, Blackman, Fowler May Set New Marks 
### 
Five Big Meet records will be en
dangered tomorrow afternoon on
Edwards Field as California's great
est team within the past decade
meets a strong Stanford squad,
worthy successors to the national
champions of last year.
Long predicted has been the fall
ol Skin Wilson's 24-year-old record
of 4 minutes 20.2 seconds for the
mile run. Bob Heavey, California
sophomore, has already run nearly a
half-second under the record, and
both Chuck Nimmo and Warren
Dixon are favored to beat him. Nim
mo's best of last year is also well
under the record.
B'.'U'kiiian May Smash Record
A1 Blackmail's time of 47.8 sec
onds for the 440-yard dash last Sat

miles, Stanford's quartet of one lap
men last Saturday ran under the
meet record of 3 minutes 15.5 sec

next to last chance to break the 2-
