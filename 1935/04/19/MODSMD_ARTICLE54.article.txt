# Stanford Man Looks For Adventures in Tropics
## 
### 
\ Adventure was what Edward t
Strong, Stanford junior, and two
companions wanted when they left 1
i the Farm last November, and they
| are finding it —in the equatorial re- j
| gions of Peru in South America.
In two weeks the three are leaving
the west coast of the southern conti
i nent to make a trip by pack train,
I canoe and river boat to the mouth
of the biggest river in the world, the
1 Amazon. And they will have no
guide on the long, four-week trek ;
which will take them through re- j
j gions where no trails are marked, J
down racing river rapids, and into j
the areas of the dread tropical fevers
where only uncivilized natives can
live.
■ Last November, Strong, and Gain
! John and Arthur Post of Palo Alto,
j left on their journey, each with only
j a little more than $300, knowing they
would be gone at least six months.
Traveled Steerage
They went first to Houston, Texas, 1
j where they took steerage passage on
| a Japanese ship for the Canal Zone.
The quarters they were given were |
terrible, they wrote home, but they
were cheap. At the canal the trio
took to the sea again, in steerage j
quarters on a Grace liner. And the
quarters this time were even worse j
j than before.
I The sea voyage ended at Mollendo,
Peru, where they immediately took j
a train to Cuzco, several hundred i

miles to the northeast. There they
have been for several months, wait
ing for the long rainy season to end
so they can start their cross-conti
nent trip.
During the stay in Cuzco, the three
California adventurers have spent
most of their time making trips in
the nearby regions. Among the most
interesting things they have seen are
the ruins of ancient Inca cities and
famed Peruvian gold mines. Their
hiking, however, has been curtailed
by the continual rains.
Hunt Jaguars
Some time they also spent on the
ranch of a young Peruvian they met
who has initiated them in the sport
of jaguar hunting.
The trip down the Amazon which
the three are about to make will
involve making a long pack train
across country until they reach a
tributary to the big river. There they
will take to canoes or rafts until
they reach the town of Manoos, the
farthest up-river point touched by
the river steamers.
If all goes right, Strong, John and
Post will arrive back in the United
States sometime in July.

During the stay in Cuzco, the three
California adventurers have spent
most of their time making trips in
the nearby regions. Among the most
interesting things they have seen are
the ruins of ancient Inca cities and
famed Peruvian gold mines. Their
hiking, however, has been curtailed
by the continual rains.
Hunt Jaguars
Some time they also spent on the
ranch of a young Peruvian they met
who has initiated them in the sport
of jaguar hunting.
The trip down the Amazon which
the three are about to make will
involve making a long pack train
across country until they reach a
tributary to the big river. There they
will take to canoes or rafts until
they reach the town of Manoos, the
farthest up-river point touched by
the river steamers.
If all goes right, Strong, John and
Post will arrive back in the United
States sometime in July.
\ Adventure was what Edward t
Strong, Stanford junior, and two
companions wanted when they left 1
i the Farm last November, and they
| are finding it —in the equatorial re- j
| gions of Peru in South America.
In two weeks the three are leaving
the west coast of the southern conti
i nent to make a trip by pack train,
I canoe and river boat to the mouth
of the biggest river in the world, the
1 Amazon. And they will have no
guide on the long, four-week trek ;
which will take them through re- j
j gions where no trails are marked, J
down racing river rapids, and into j
the areas of the dread tropical fevers
where only uncivilized natives can
live.
■ Last November, Strong, and Gain
! John and Arthur Post of Palo Alto,
j left on their journey, each with only
j a little more than $300, knowing they
would be gone at least six months.
Traveled Steerage
They went first to Houston, Texas, 1
j where they took steerage passage on
| a Japanese ship for the Canal Zone.
The quarters they were given were |
terrible, they wrote home, but they
were cheap. At the canal the trio
took to the sea again, in steerage j
quarters on a Grace liner. And the
quarters this time were even worse j
j than before.
I The sea voyage ended at Mollendo,
Peru, where they immediately took j
a train to Cuzco, several hundred i

miles to the northeast. There they
have been for several months, wait
ing for the long rainy season to end
so they can start their cross-conti
nent trip.
