STANFORD'S ACE
IRON MAN

In 40 years of records is found
the reason why California vs. Stan
ford is the Big Meet of coast track
competition. That thick pile of score
sheets provides a worthy cross sec
tion of the history of track and field
marks.
In the stack of Big Meet re
sults since 1893 is hinted the long
struggle of athletes and coaches to
excell, to break records. In them
is reflected the tremendous strides,
from the standpoint of records,
that hive been made in the past
few years.
It took the athletes of Stanford and
California 18 years to break 4 min
utes and 30 seconds in the mile, and
that lace in the 1900 Big Meet was
won in 5 minutes 1.4 seconds. In
the 17 years since 1918 only four
mile runs have been won in over
4:30.
In contrast to the mass of 9.4,
9.5, and 9.(> second 100-yard dash
es th,**t have Hooded the sport
pages in recent years, only three
Big Meet centuries have broken
10 flat, and all three within the
last three years by California's
Bob Kiesel.

Shot-putting is one of Stanford's
prides, but in the first 10 years a
put of under 40 feet could have won
any Big Meet contest, and it took
17 more years before 50 feet was
surpassed. Now Jim Reynolds is a
foot and a half ahead of any of
Stanford's sophomore putters, and
his 51 feet 5 inches is far from a
cinch for first.
Big Meet results are worth many
a chuckle. Here are a few: 1893
"COACH —no coach; mile walk —
won in 7:25.4; 2 mile bicycle—won
in 6:8." 1906 "No meet with Cali
fornia due to earthquake of Api'il
18. 1907 "Attendance 4900, largest
field day crowd ever assembled on
western slope." A word could be
said about the crowd that will pack
Edwards Field tomorrow!

In the long years of Big Meet his
tory are the stories of stand-out
athletes, men whose marks would
have made them stars in any day.
One wonders what modern scien
tific training and improved methods
would have made of Miller of Stan
ford, who won the 1908 Big Meet
half mile in 1 minute 57.1 seconds.
Horine's 6 foot 6'/8 inch high jump
in 1912 has won a prominent place
in coast track history, along with
the famed Horine-Beeson (of Cali
fornia) jumping duels. The year 1914
found Stanford with two middle dis
tance aces whose marks are still
worthy of prominence today. E. M.
Bonnet won the half in 1 minute
54.3 seconds, and Skin Wilson set
his Big Meet mile record of 4:20.
In 1919 Wells of Stanford won
the 100-yard dash in 10.2 scconds,
the 220 in 22.4 seconds; the highs
in 16.3; and the lows in 26.4. His
iron nvvn performance of that year
is the greatest of its kind in Big
Meet history.
Another heavy afternoon was put.
in by Miller of the Indians in 1926,
who, with a first in the 440 in 48.9
seconds, broke the tape in the half
in 1.53.8, and ran anchor lap in a
3:17.6 mile relay.
With the return of a scramble for
points between the two teams, the
Big Meet of tomorrow is sure to re
cord a number of ace performances.
Whom do you pick?
