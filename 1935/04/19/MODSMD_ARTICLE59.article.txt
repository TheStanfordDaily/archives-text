# DEADLINE FOR BIG MEET DOPE SHEET CONTEST AT NOON
## 
### 
One of the tightest Big Meets in
the last twenty years has the local
track enthusiasts frantic over dope
sheets. Last minute injuries and en
tries have not lessened the difficulty,
but the entrants in the Big Meet
Dope Sheet contest are practically
unanimous in one fact: the Indians
will win, by anywhere from one
third of a point to ten points.
To the contest winners, to be an
nounced Monday after a scientific
calculation of the sheets, will go
tokens of forecasting ability in the
line of men's neckwear, through the
courtesy of Khodes, Wideman's, and
Phelps-Terkel in Palo Alto.
Deadline on the entries is noon
today, and they can be placed in the
envelope on the Daiiy bulletin board
or given to any member of the sports
staff. Indicate three places for each
event
