# Clipper Crew Preparing Trip Data for Records
## 
### 
HONOLULU, April 18 (/Pi.â€”A 48-
hour job of checking, segregating,
and analyzing data gathered on their
record-smashing first commercial
flight between California and Hawaii
was started here today by the crew
of the Pan-American clipper.
Well rested from the 2400-mile
trail-blazing venture which they
completed yesterday, the fliers col
laborated with executives of Pan-
American Airways to get a com
plete record down on paper for use
when they push on westward this
summer to establish commercial
service all the way across the Pa
cific.
