# Card Nine Upsets Bears; Play Again Tomorrow
## BIG FOURTH INNING CAUSES SURPRISE 8-6 CARD VICTORY Hamilton, Anderson, and Heringer Star 
### Bob Leland 
They'll decide it Saturday morn
ing when Indian and Bear nines !
meet in the deciding game of the J
series at Edwards Field diamond at !
10:15 o'clock.
The reason for this can be laid at !
the hands of Bones Hamilton and !
co-Captains Stan Anderson and !
Fred Heringer, who led the Cards to j
an 8-6 victory.
It was Anderson and Hamilton
who combined to drive in five runs
in the big fourth inning, while Her
inger stepped to the firing line in
the sixth and pitched masterful j
ball for the remaining three frames, j
Anderson was invincible for five I
innings, but when with one out in ;
the sixth Cal scored three markers
without a hit, Stan was lifted and
Heringer stepped in to retire the I
side. Anderson allowed three hits |
and struck out five.
Bears Bunch Hits
The Bears managed to get their j
! hits in the right places. In the third, !
| fourth, and seventh innings they |
i scored a run an inning, each with j
I the aid of but a lone hit. Eight
j passes by Anderson and five errors,
i two each for Frank Tremaine and
! Howell Turner, and one for Ed
! Clark contributed to the Bear scores, j
Stanford grabbed the lead in the |
'second inning on a base on baits to
j Hamilton, a stolen base and Tre
i maine's one-base blow. Frank inci
' dentally led the Card batting at
| tack with two hits.
Indians Rally in Fourth
At the time the Indians put on
their rally, Cal was leading 2-1 by I
virtue of a run scored in the first !
half of the fourth. Hamilton started
the inning by striking out. Turner
j met a similar fate.
Tremaine then poked a hit over j
I second. Clark slapped a double to j
I left and Mike Ferro walked to fill :
| the bases. Anderson then stepped to !
lthe plate and unloaded a lusty
{double to center, Tremaine and Clark
j scoring.
j That blow finished Gallison. Ted ;
! Leidig greeted Hardt with a sharp I
j drive to center and Ferro trotted j
home. A1 Brent straightened one of
Hardt's curves for a single and An-
j derson scored.
Gordy Mallatratt drew a base on
balls and Hamilton up for the second
( time in the inning drove out a long |
hit scoring Leidig, Brent, and Mai- j
latratt. That blow finished the con
test as far as the Indians were con- \
cerned but it was enough.
Heringer Holds Bears
The Bears threatened in the sixth
! but Heringer put the brakes on and
| though Cal scored one in the sev
jenth, Fred held the upper hand. Al- :
j together five pitchers paraded to the j
j mound. Gilbert, who started for the
'Bears, lasted till the second, Galli- j
i son went out in the wild fourth, and '
Hardt finished up.
It was a wild contest, the five
j pitchers contributing 15 bases on j
balls, a wild pitch and one hit batter.
Hamilton stole three bases and Tre- |
, maine one. Crawford of the Bears
got the longest hit, a triple.
