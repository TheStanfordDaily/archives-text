# Nort Thornton Tells Card Swim History
## Pictures Reveal Stanford's Aquatic Laurels 
### Herb Diamond 
Any one of these balmy spring
afternoons now you might saunter
over to Encina pools, visit what usu
ally seems to be the nucleus of dry
land activity—the office of Coach
Nort Thornton—and there you may
actually see history.
| For Stanford's swimming history,
j an inspiring photographic record of
| past achievement, is encased and
I suspended on the wall, and the cam
! era doesn't lie. Coach Thornton will:
! tell you it's his Hall of Fame, and '
weil may the Farm point to it with j
j pride, after scanning a few of its |
| records. Every one of those bronzed i
i fellows, from springboard artist Clar- j
ence Pinkston back in 1920 right up j
to our own Captain Bobby Foster, I
J latest addition to the champions'
j brigade, captures your admiration, j
McKelvey's Records Stand
Up there in the center, holding
i down the seat of honor, you see
; young John McKelvey. It is McKel
vey who still possesses the 40 and 50-
■ yard free-style titles that he gained
j at the first annual Stanford Relays j
in 1932. His mark of 17.tt seconds in .
the 40 and exactly 22.5 in the 50 i
haven't been surpassed yet. McKel
i vey had to top Johnny Weissmuller's j
terrific pace to garner the honors in j
those events and in doing so, inci- j
j dentally, became the world's fastest!
human in the aquatic reaim.
Then we have a quintet of aero- j
batic gentlemen: Pink.%ton, already j
! mentioned, who was Olympic and
| National diving champion 15 years;
j ago; Al White, who earned the same !
titles in 1924; and Pete Desjardins, j
j who wore the very same crowns four !
! years later; Ed Throndson, National
Intercollegiate champ in 1930; and
| Dave Fall, who had to do more than !
\ his name would indicate to take j
I second place in the high dive at the |
j 1924 Olympiad.
Ross Won Every Event
Witness the feat of Wally O'Connor
| —N.C.A.A. titlist in the 220 and 440 ,
| free styles in 1924 and 1925, Olympic
I swimming team 1924, '28, and '32, !
I member of the Olympic water polo
squad during the same years and J
captain of the water poloists in 1932.
j Such were his brilliant accomplish
! ments.
| Now back to 1920 again. Norman
Ross, not to be outdone by any mer- I
j man, collected every mark from the
220 to the mile for himself and Stan- 1
ford. Here was the Jack Medica of
1 15 years ago.
Clapp in Olympics Twice
Austin Clapp, N.C.A.A. and A.A.U. j
ace of 1928 and '29, twice won the j
plaudits of Olympic Games audi
ence, first on the swim aggregation
in '28 and then, in '32, in the water
polo ranks.
Right over here is Frank Booth,
' who owns an Olympic crown won in
the 800-meter relays; 1932 was his
year. And there's Ted Wiget. Three
times he claimed the National Inter
collegiate championship in the 220
and 440. In 1932 he too was an Olym
pic contestant.

Bob Clark still holds his 300-yard
medley National Intercollegiate mark
of 3:45.7 which he hung up two
years ago. Here is backstroker Fred
i Tebbets—he was the fellow who set
the 50-yard and 400-meter American
back stroke records in 1933. And
now there is Bobby Foster, retiring
captain of Stanford's swimmers, who
t has been acclaimed as the greatest of
the Pacific Coast breast stroke men.
Among his titles are Pacific Coast
Intercollegiate champion, 200-yard
i breast stroke; and National cham

pion, 400-yard breast stroke.
Take a look at that water polo
record! Two games lost in 22 years
of competition. One of these went to
U.S.C. in 1932. California took the
other last year. A few of the Stan
ford greats who helped to pile up
Pacific Coast championships in 21
of those 22 years were "Ginger" Aus
tin, Elmer Collett, Reggie Harrison,
Cal Strong, Denny Driggs, and Nor
ton Thornton, says the caption.

Clapp in Olympics Twice
Austin Clapp, N.C.A.A. and A.A.U. j
ace of 1928 and '29, twice won the j
plaudits of Olympic Games audi
ence, first on the swim aggregation
in '28 and then, in '32, in the water
polo ranks.
Right over here is Frank Booth,
' who owns an Olympic crown won in
the 800-meter relays; 1932 was his
year. And there's Ted Wiget. Three
times he claimed the National Inter
collegiate championship in the 220
and 440. In 1932 he too was an Olym
pic contestant.

Bob Clark still holds his 300-yard
medley National Intercollegiate mark
of 3:45.7 which he hung up two
years ago. Here is backstroker Fred
i Tebbets—he was the fellow who set
the 50-yard and 400-meter American
back stroke records in 1933. And
now there is Bobby Foster, retiring
captain of Stanford's swimmers, who
t has been acclaimed as the greatest of
the Pacific Coast breast stroke men.
Among his titles are Pacific Coast
Intercollegiate champion, 200-yard
i breast stroke; and National cham

pion, 400-yard breast stroke.
Take a look at that water polo
record! Two games lost in 22 years
of competition. One of these went to
U.S.C. in 1932. California took the
other last year. A few of the Stan
ford greats who helped to pile up
Pacific Coast championships in 21
of those 22 years were "Ginger" Aus
tin, Elmer Collett, Reggie Harrison,
Cal Strong, Denny Driggs, and Nor
ton Thornton, says the caption.

McKelvey's Records Stand
Up there in the center, holding
i down the seat of honor, you see
; young John McKelvey. It is McKel
vey who still possesses the 40 and 50-
■ yard free-style titles that he gained
j at the first annual Stanford Relays j
in 1932. His mark of 17.tt seconds in .
the 40 and exactly 22.5 in the 50 i
haven't been surpassed yet. McKel
i vey had to top Johnny Weissmuller's j
terrific pace to garner the honors in j
those events and in doing so, inci- j
j dentally, became the world's fastest!
human in the aquatic reaim.
Then we have a quintet of aero- j
batic gentlemen: Pink.%ton, already j
! mentioned, who was Olympic and
| National diving champion 15 years;
j ago; Al White, who earned the same !
titles in 1924; and Pete Desjardins, j
j who wore the very same crowns four !
! years later; Ed Throndson, National
Intercollegiate champ in 1930; and
| Dave Fall, who had to do more than !
\ his name would indicate to take j
I second place in the high dive at the |
j 1924 Olympiad.

vey who still possesses the 40 and 50-
■ yard free-style titles that he gained
j at the first annual Stanford Relays j
in 1932. His mark of 17.tt seconds in .
the 40 and exactly 22.5 in the 50 i
haven't been surpassed yet. McKel
i vey had to top Johnny Weissmuller's j
terrific pace to garner the honors in j
those events and in doing so, inci- j
j dentally, became the world's fastest!
human in the aquatic reaim.
Then we have a quintet of aero- j
batic gentlemen: Pink.%ton, already j
! mentioned, who was Olympic and
| National diving champion 15 years;
j ago; Al White, who earned the same !
titles in 1924; and Pete Desjardins, j
j who wore the very same crowns four !
! years later; Ed Throndson, National
Intercollegiate champ in 1930; and
| Dave Fall, who had to do more than !
\ his name would indicate to take j
I second place in the high dive at the |
j 1924 Olympiad.
Ross Won Every Event
Witness the feat of Wally O'Connor
| —N.C.A.A. titlist in the 220 and 440 ,
| free styles in 1924 and 1925, Olympic
I swimming team 1924, '28, and '32, !
I member of the Olympic water polo
squad during the same years and J
captain of the water poloists in 1932.
j Such were his brilliant accomplish
! ments.
| Now back to 1920 again. Norman
Ross, not to be outdone by any mer- I
j man, collected every mark from the
220 to the mile for himself and Stan- 1
ford. Here was the Jack Medica of
1 15 years ago.
Clapp in Olympics Twice
Austin Clapp, N.C.A.A. and A.A.U. j
ace of 1928 and '29, twice won the j
plaudits of Olympic Games audi
ence, first on the swim aggregation
in '28 and then, in '32, in the water
polo ranks.
Right over here is Frank Booth,
' who owns an Olympic crown won in
the 800-meter relays; 1932 was his
year. And there's Ted Wiget. Three
times he claimed the National Inter
collegiate championship in the 220
and 440. In 1932 he too was an Olym
pic contestant.

Bob Clark still holds his 300-yard
medley National Intercollegiate mark
of 3:45.7 which he hung up two
years ago. Here is backstroker Fred
i Tebbets—he was the fellow who set
the 50-yard and 400-meter American
back stroke records in 1933. And
now there is Bobby Foster, retiring
captain of Stanford's swimmers, who
t has been acclaimed as the greatest of
the Pacific Coast breast stroke men.
Among his titles are Pacific Coast
Intercollegiate champion, 200-yard
i breast stroke; and National cham

pion, 400-yard breast stroke.
Take a look at that water polo
record! Two games lost in 22 years
of competition. One of these went to
U.S.C. in 1932. California took the
other last year. A few of the Stan
ford greats who helped to pile up
Pacific Coast championships in 21
of those 22 years were "Ginger" Aus
tin, Elmer Collett, Reggie Harrison,
Cal Strong, Denny Driggs, and Nor
ton Thornton, says the caption.
Any one of these balmy spring
afternoons now you might saunter
over to Encina pools, visit what usu
ally seems to be the nucleus of dry
land activity—the office of Coach
Nort Thornton—and there you may
actually see history.
| For Stanford's swimming history,
j an inspiring photographic record of
| past achievement, is encased and
I suspended on the wall, and the cam
! era doesn't lie. Coach Thornton will:
! tell you it's his Hall of Fame, and '
weil may the Farm point to it with j
j pride, after scanning a few of its |
| records. Every one of those bronzed i
i fellows, from springboard artist Clar- j
ence Pinkston back in 1920 right up j
to our own Captain Bobby Foster, I
J latest addition to the champions'
j brigade, captures your admiration, j
