# "WE HAVE CHANCE" DINK PROPHESIES IN MEET INTERVIEW
## 
### 
"California has the strength of en
tries. But Stanford has a fighting
team. We DO have a chance." That
is the way Dink Templeton last night
viewed the track squad's meet with
California tomorrow.
Templeton predicted a meet with
every event a "crucial" and named
the broad jump as the most crucial
of the crucial, "because neither coach
knows what to expect of his entries."
Tempieton said George Tharp and
Ray Dean were Stanford's principal
hopes in this event.
The preponderance of California
men in every event stacked up
against lone Stanford specialists
seemed to be the Stanford coach's
only worry as his team tapered off
practice for the meet.
Templeton, in answer to a ques
tion, replied that all Stanford per
formers had been shown, and he
expected points from his consistent
pei-formers, not dark horses.
