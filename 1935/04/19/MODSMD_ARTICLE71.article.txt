# Bear Sports Editor Hopeful; Says U.C. Will Nose Out Cards
## Toss-up Events Leave Meet Outcome Questionable; Pollock Not Sure 
### Roger Johnson 
(Sports Editor, Daily Californian)
This has been a fertile week in
Berkeley for those who are addicted
to formulating dope sheets.
Fertile? Because it has offered an >
opportunity to Californians to figure
out ways and means for the Golden i
Bear track team to end the long- ;
enduring Stanford drought which j
has been the focal point of consterna- j
tion here for 10, these many years, j
Optimism at Berkeley
There has been a hesitant under- j
current of optimism concerning the
1935 Big Meet on the California cam- j
pus for quite some time now—since j
Coach Brutus Hamilton began ex
hibiting his squad in Edwards sta- !
dium against early opponents such 1
as U.S.F., Olympic Club and U.C.L.A. I
The 1935 edition of the Bear ;
track series is a new departure |
from those of the recent past. For i
it has definitely proved itself a
"come through" team — something
which has been conspicuous by its j
absence since the hey-days of 1
Walter Christie.
Tomorrow Californians are putting
their trust in the "come through" j
performers to turn the trifck over j
Dink Templeton's vastly underrated !
aggregation. But when the list of l
certain "come through" performers '
is depleted, the dope sheeters run up
against a brick wall of conjecture. |
In other words, second and third j
places in most events are wide open, I
as are some of the first places.
Pick Moore Over Klopstock
For instance, there are those who |
dare forecast that Tom Moore will j
beat out Sam Klopstock in the high
hurdles, just as there are those who 1
think the Kiopstock-Fishback battle j
in the low sticks can go either way. 1
George Anderson is conceded vie- J
tories in the century and furlong; '
but who's in line for the rest of the !
points? Mushy Pollock may be i
scratched from the sprints. In that |
event, Voigt and Dean seem to be i
the logical runners-up. But no one J
knows for sure whether Mushy will
be entered.
There are many who believe the
broad jump will decide the meet. <
At the present writing, that event
seems destined to become a battle !
between second and third - choice j
performers around the 21-foot mark. '
Stanford's Tharp, Dean, and Mos- I
crip promise nothing spectacular; |
but neither do California's Wood,:
Vallejo, Costello, Wilson, or Cooper. I
Here is a dazzling opportunity for i
some unknown Frank Mcrriwell to
appear on the scene and come 1
through with a Carl Schott act.
So we might go on down the list |
pointing out possibilities for upsets !
which might swing the tide either j
way. But to save time and space, }
we present forthwith our dope sheet, I
minus Pollock, and distributing the |
breaks as eveniy as possible. Tear j
it to pieces. I

current of optimism concerning the
1935 Big Meet on the California cam- j
pus for quite some time now—since j
Coach Brutus Hamilton began ex
hibiting his squad in Edwards sta- !
dium against early opponents such 1
as U.S.F., Olympic Club and U.C.L.A. I
The 1935 edition of the Bear ;
track series is a new departure |
from those of the recent past. For i
it has definitely proved itself a
"come through" team — something
which has been conspicuous by its j
absence since the hey-days of 1
Walter Christie.
Tomorrow Californians are putting
their trust in the "come through" j
performers to turn the trifck over j
Dink Templeton's vastly underrated !
aggregation. But when the list of l
certain "come through" performers '
is depleted, the dope sheeters run up
against a brick wall of conjecture. |
In other words, second and third j
places in most events are wide open, I
as are some of the first places.

For instance, there are those who |
dare forecast that Tom Moore will j

think the Kiopstock-Fishback battle j
