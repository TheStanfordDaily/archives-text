Law Outstanding
Johnny Law took the measure of
Bennett in the first singles, 8-6, 1-6,
6-1. This was the day's most spec

tion at the top of the rankings by
staging a great comeback to take the
third set.

love count, but the Bear put on the

ers in the next two years.

soph moved up to fifth position, only
to be conquered by Lynch, 4-6, 6-4,
6-4. In an even closer match, Pom
mer won over Dunlop, 1-6, 12-10,
6-3. Both these victories were essen
tial to the Card cause.
Doubles Matches Easy

reputation as a doubles team by
taking the second four-man match
from Captain Mel Whitman and
Norman Bakulich of the Golden
Bears. Scores were 6-4, 6-1, with
the issue never in doubt.
