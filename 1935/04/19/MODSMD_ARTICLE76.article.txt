skeleton squad of seven or eight men
will make the trip.

year's "Seven Avengers," Sam Klop
stock, A1 Blackman, John Mottram
and Chuck Nimmo, there will be
Phil Levy, Jim Reynolds, Humberl
Smith, and Warren Dixon.

Dick Brace, Jack Mauger, and Gler
Randell that is responsible.

California plays host to the coun
try's track standouts at the N.C.A.A.
meet in June. Here again Cards and
Bears will be well represented, and
; the proximity of the meet may put
the two even more in a class by
themselves.
Other competitions involving both
teams are the Pacific Association
A.A.U. meet at Stanford May 25, i
and the Fresno Relays, in which (
only a few of the standard events
are run, in three weeks.
Competition on the track between
Stanford and California will not be
finished for the year w'th the relay
tomorrow; on the contrary, it will
be barely begun, as the two teams
go on into the sectional and na
tional meets.
California, Stanford, and U.S.C., as
they have for the past decade, will
again dominate the national track
and field horizon, and the Indians
may be fighting with the Bears for
several titles.
Rely on Few
Coach Dink Templeton will again
rely on a small group of outstanding
stars in the bigger meets, and in
the Board of Athletic Control votes
tc send Stanford to defend her
1.C.4-A. title on May 17 and 18, a
skeleton squad of seven or eight men
will make the trip.
Besides the four holdovers of last
year's "Seven Avengers," Sam Klop
stock, A1 Blackman, John Mottram
and Chuck Nimmo, there will be
Phil Levy, Jim Reynolds, Humberl
Smith, and Warren Dixon.
If these eight fail to repeat thcii
championship this year, it may be u
group of Califomians including
George Mackey, Bob Fowler, Georgi
Anderson, Mushy Pollock, Ton
Moore, Del Fishback, Bob Heavry
Dick Brace, Jack Mauger, and Gler
Randell that is responsible.
