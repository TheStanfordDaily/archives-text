# RECORDS ESTABLISHED BY TRACK GREATS RECALLED

### GORDON FROST 
It was a modest, bespectacled Ben
Bangs Eastman who turned a quiet,
uninterested Stanford campus into
jabbering, track-mad enthusiasts just
two years ago last month.
• Sports dopesters prophesied thai on
i that Saturday afternoon of March
26, 1932, a little-known Stanford
quarter-miler by the name of East
man might break a world's record.
And so it was that Angell Field was
made ready for the best—that East
man might take a few tenths of a
second off that 440 record of 47.4
•econds made by Ted Meredith in
1916.*
Careful Preparations
Stop watches were checked and
double-checked for accuracy, the
track was measured and found to be
just three inches over the quarter
mile, wind indicators were installed
I measuring a two-mile zephyr. And
; then they turned Ben loose!
Coming out of the holes with
terrific speed, "Big Ben" proceeded
to cover the 419 yards faster than
human legs had ever carried a man
that distance. When he sliced
through the tape fans sensed that
they had just witnessed something
more than an ordinary quarter
i mile—something really great. They
j had: Ben Eastman had set the pres
ent world's record of 46.4 seconds
for the 449-yard dash.
Glor}' wasn't absolutely new to
I Eastman, for a year before, in March
j of 1931, under the arc lights of the
j Fiesno State College stadium, he and
three other Stanford unforgettables,
j Maynor Shove, Ike Hables, and Les
Hables, had run the mile relay in the
fastest time ever recorded, 3:12.6.
! The week before, on Angell Field,
; that same team traversed the mile in
3:l4.3—the fastest mile reiay ever

I timed in America. But at Fresno
they wrote in indelible ink a time
faster by eight-tenths of a second
than the world's mark set in London
I in 1926 by America's great Olympic
! Games quartet of Laird, Taylor, liar
buti, and Spencer.
Jump Kci'ords Set Here
But when we turn back the pages
ot Angell Field track history thcie is
no overlooking the world's records j
ol those two masters of the jump— I
' Bill Graber of U.S.C. in the pole
i vault, and Walter Marty of Fresno 1
! State in iho high jump.
j Graber came to Stanford in 1932 to !
I battle against Stanford's Bill Miller
for the right to represent Uncle Sam
| in the Olympic Games, and a battle
j it turned out to be. Miller started the j
festivities by breaking the world's
record with a jump of 14 feet I'm i
inches—a record which lasted just
half an hour. For Graber, undaunt- j
| ed, slid over the bar at 14 feet 4 r, fi !
I inches to set a new world's mark
i which .still stands.
! Three months later neither Graber
> nor Miller could threaten the Angell
Field mark when competing under 1
Olympic Games competition, but the 1
i Indian vaulter carried Stanford col- '
ors high by setting a new Olympic ;
record of 14 feet 2 7 « inches.
Marty Broke Mark Ilere
In April of last year at the All -
! University meet another great jump
: er, Walter Marty, rose to new heights ]
for Stanford's most recent world's
record and shattered his own re
cently made world's mark of 6 feet j
8% inches. Marty shed his sweat
; clothes for his third attempt, took a j
short run, and gyrated his slender
i form over the Angell Field cross bar ;
at (j feet 9's inches, to write a new
I record into the book.
