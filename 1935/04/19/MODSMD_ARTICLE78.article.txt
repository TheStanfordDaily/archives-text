# CARD TRACKSTERS WOULD HAVE BEEN WONDERS IN 1893
## Records of First Big Meet Show Queer Events 
### John McClelland 
Born 42 years too late. That could
well be the lament of all the Cal
and Stanford tracksters who will
compete in the forty-second annual
Big Meet tomorrow.
Heroes—they'd all be heroes,
and record breakers, too, if they
hud been the ones who had taken
the field on a cold, dismal day in
April, 18«: i, when the first Card-
Bear track meet was held.
Couldn't Klopstock better 28 2/5
seconds in the 220 hurdles —couldn't
Smith beat five-eight in the high
jump—and couldn't Anderson top 10
feet in the pole vault. Those were
winning marks back in early Stan
lord days—marks that gave Califor
nia a 91-35 win.
Many Events Different
But even though such records
would seem ridiculous in tomorrow's
meet who, on either the Cal or In
dian teams, could make the two mile
bike race in 6:18, the milk walk in
7:25, or toss the hammer 86:8? Track
men did things in that meet that
most 1935 cinder stars never saw.
Stanford went to its lii'sl Big Meet
"a little out of condition," the papers
said. Cal won most of the events,
and here are some of the records:
Hundred-yard dash, 10:7; 880,
2:5.4; mile run, 5:4; 440, 52.5; high
jump, 5 feet 8 inches; shot put, 36
feet 8 inches; broad jump, 21 feet
7 inches, pole vault, 10 feet.
' Bernard Scores in Century
A man named Bernard was the
Farm's hero in the city that day.
(The meet was held on the Olympic
Club grounds.) He won the 100-
yard dash in 10.7. Kiesel won it
last year in 9.8, and it was consid
ered slow time.
Track records fall slowly. Twenty
three years after Big Meet number
one all the original marks had been
lowered, but only by about half of
what they are now. Tomorrow some
of the records are likely to fall again.
And track coaches can look back and
ahead: records have been improved
by a lot in half a century. What
will happen when the limit of ath
letes' ability is reached?

and record breakers, too, if they
hud been the ones who had taken
the field on a cold, dismal day in
April, 18«: i, when the first Card-
Bear track meet was held.
Couldn't Klopstock better 28 2/5
seconds in the 220 hurdles —couldn't
Smith beat five-eight in the high
jump—and couldn't Anderson top 10
feet in the pole vault. Those were
winning marks back in early Stan
lord days—marks that gave Califor
nia a 91-35 win.
Many Events Different
But even though such records
would seem ridiculous in tomorrow's
meet who, on either the Cal or In
dian teams, could make the two mile
bike race in 6:18, the milk walk in
7:25, or toss the hammer 86:8? Track
men did things in that meet that
most 1935 cinder stars never saw.
Stanford went to its lii'sl Big Meet
"a little out of condition," the papers
said. Cal won most of the events,
and here are some of the records:
Hundred-yard dash, 10:7; 880,
2:5.4; mile run, 5:4; 440, 52.5; high
jump, 5 feet 8 inches; shot put, 36
feet 8 inches; broad jump, 21 feet
7 inches, pole vault, 10 feet.
' Bernard Scores in Century
A man named Bernard was the
Farm's hero in the city that day.
(The meet was held on the Olympic
Club grounds.) He won the 100-
yard dash in 10.7. Kiesel won it
last year in 9.8, and it was consid
ered slow time.
Track records fall slowly. Twenty
three years after Big Meet number
one all the original marks had been
lowered, but only by about half of
what they are now. Tomorrow some
of the records are likely to fall again.
And track coaches can look back and
ahead: records have been improved
by a lot in half a century. What
will happen when the limit of ath
letes' ability is reached?
Born 42 years too late. That could
well be the lament of all the Cal
and Stanford tracksters who will
compete in the forty-second annual
Big Meet tomorrow.
Heroes—they'd all be heroes,
and record breakers, too, if they
