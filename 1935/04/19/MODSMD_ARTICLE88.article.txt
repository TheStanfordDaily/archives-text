## 
### Charles Thomas 
, In a final game preparatory to
meeting the University of Arizona
Wildcats next Monday, Wednesday,
and Friday in the big series of west
iem intercollegiate polo, Stanford's
j poloists are scheduled to encounter
the Black-Foxe Military Academy
four this afternoon at 3 o'clock.
Black-Foxe, though only a prep
school, has a real polo outfit which
| should supply the needed competi
tion to prepare the Cards for next
week's series. Stanford played two
games with the Los Angeles aggre
gation last year and won both by
uncomfortably narrow margins.
Squad Arrived Yesterday
I The Black-Foxe squad of seven
players arrived last night, accord
ing to Lieut. H. Y. Grubbs, Card
coach. Their starting line-up will
1 consist of Mickey Mcßan, Tom Beal,
Chester Foxe, and Captain John
Barneson. This quartet has the rep
utation of being one of the strongest
prep outfits in the United States.
The Card varsity remains set with
Carl Beal at No. 1, Captain Bill
Rogers at No. 2, Russ Rasmussen at
No. 3, and Bob Fullerton at No. 4
position. With the exception of Beal,
the same Card line-up which com
posed last year's western champion
! ship team which vanquished Ari
zona two games out of three, will
, again face the Wildcat outfit next
week.
Cards Out for Revenge
j The Indians have been smarting
over a double defeat last Thanksgiv
ing at the hands of the Arizona rid-
I ers and are out for revenge. A much
improved quartet over the one
which travelled to Tucson last win-
I ter will ride out to meet the invad
; ing Arizonans, reports indicate.
Those first encounters against the
Wildcats were played on strange
horses and were the first games of
the season. With much competition
behind them since then the Red
shirts have shown steady improve
ment.
In order to win the series of Ari
i zona games, the Indians will have to
; sweep next week's games.
