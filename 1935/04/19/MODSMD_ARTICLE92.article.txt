# BEARS CLAMOR FOR WORK IN HAMILTON'S PRACTICE
## 
### 
One of Brutus Hamilton's after
noon practice sessions at Edwards
Field would make most of the thou
sand-odd track coaches in the coun
try feel very depressed indeed.
For Brutus Hamilton's,afternoon
practice sessions come very close
to reaching the acme of what a
coach wants.
He doesn't have to threaten, beg,
or cajole his boys into working—
they go up and ask him if they can
run. It sounds funny, but it's a fact.
Mental Staie Perfect
The genial Bear mentor has his
boys in the perfect psychological
state —at least for practice.
One day a couple of weeks ago the
wandering Daily reporter sneaked in
by a devious route to glimpse the
Kansas fox put his Bears through .a
workout. The reporter watched him,
full of doubt.
George Anderson came up, with
Mushy Pollock. Both said they
wouldn't come out any more unless
Brutus would let them run at least
one 220. Brutus was afraid of their
condition; so he had them practically
in tears when he confined their
workout to a couple of easy hun
dreds. And no broad jumping for
Mushy, no hurdling for George.
Milers Eager
Then up came Les Voorhees, and
reported that he was ready for a fast
mile. Brutus said that if he must
run one, he must; so he went over to
frosh coach A1 Ragan and asked him
if he had any babe milers. Three
frosh heard him, as well as one var
sity man, and they all immediately
shed their sweatsuits and took their
marks—and Hamilton hadn't even
asked one to run.
So it went. Greg Stout wanted to
run a quarter; a couple of novices
all ran. Bob Fowler sidled up and
said they wanted to try too; so they
fold Brutus he wanted to run an 880
to get speed. More frosh ran with
him. It was astounding.
A couple of fellows even wanted
to run a two-mile. Now at Stan
ford a couple of fellows like that
would he clapped in a padded cell
without a further word.
But Brutus Hamilton has his
Golden Bears working for him. That's
why his team is given a good chance
of beating the Cards tomorrow.

or cajole his boys into working—
they go up and ask him if they can
run. It sounds funny, but it's a fact.
Mental Staie Perfect
The genial Bear mentor has his
boys in the perfect psychological
state —at least for practice.
One day a couple of weeks ago the
wandering Daily reporter sneaked in
by a devious route to glimpse the
Kansas fox put his Bears through .a
workout. The reporter watched him,
full of doubt.
George Anderson came up, with
Mushy Pollock. Both said they
wouldn't come out any more unless
Brutus would let them run at least
one 220. Brutus was afraid of their
condition; so he had them practically
in tears when he confined their
workout to a couple of easy hun
dreds. And no broad jumping for
Mushy, no hurdling for George.
Milers Eager
Then up came Les Voorhees, and
reported that he was ready for a fast
mile. Brutus said that if he must
run one, he must; so he went over to
frosh coach A1 Ragan and asked him
if he had any babe milers. Three
frosh heard him, as well as one var
sity man, and they all immediately
shed their sweatsuits and took their
marks—and Hamilton hadn't even
asked one to run.
So it went. Greg Stout wanted to
run a quarter; a couple of novices
all ran. Bob Fowler sidled up and
said they wanted to try too; so they
fold Brutus he wanted to run an 880
to get speed. More frosh ran with
him. It was astounding.
A couple of fellows even wanted
to run a two-mile. Now at Stan
ford a couple of fellows like that
would he clapped in a padded cell
without a further word.
But Brutus Hamilton has his
Golden Bears working for him. That's
why his team is given a good chance
of beating the Cards tomorrow.
