# BROTHER P. DEAN STARTS STRING OF 40 CARDINAL WINS
## 
### 
CHICAGO, April 18 (/P). â€”Brother
i Paul Dean, handsomely assisted by
Joe Medwick, conquered the Chicago
Cubs today, 1 to 0, for the first of the '
40 victories this season promised by
; the speaking member of the Dean
; clan, brother Dizzy, for the St. Louis
I Cards.
Medwick's contribution was a
i line-smash home run in the sixth
j tie, and Brother Paul didn't need
] anything else. He gave eight hits, j
|to only five allowed by Larry i
French, but whenever danger threat
jened, he had the Cubs popping up or
striking out.
A shivering crowd of 3200 specta- j
; tors had hopes that Brother Paul
would last no longer than Brother
Dizzy did in the opener Tuesday
when little Augie Galan shoved off
in the Cubs' half of the first inning j
with a double. He might just as well i
have been anchored to the bag, how
! ever, for Brother Paul fanned Billy :
Herman and forced Kiki Cuyler and !
' Freddy Lindstrom to pop to Collins, j
Clarence Thorpe of Kansas can j
draw simultaneously with both |
hands and feet.
