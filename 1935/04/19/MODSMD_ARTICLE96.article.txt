There are experts in every line and !

William "Re#" Kelley ranks tops I
Twelve years of experience as the j
Coast's leading starter have given
"Red," as he is known in cinder j

has it down to an art.
At every leading track event
"Red" can be seen on the starting

keep on your toes, but still remain
calm."

the greats—Percy Beard, Bud Spen

letting them go," as they did in the
days of Charlie Paddock, starters are

second longer before the gun; not
too long but just to the point where
they are ready to go without jump-
