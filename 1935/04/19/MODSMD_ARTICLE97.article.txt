# CARDINAL GOLFERS MAKE PLANS FOR AMATEUR TOURNEY
## Northern California Meet Scheduled April 23 
### 
With the California matches safely
won, the • Stanford golf teams, both
freshman and varsity, started prac
tice with the Northern California
Amateur tournament as their goal.
The event will be played on the San
Francisco Country Club links on
April 2G.
Stanford made a great bid for it
last year in the person of "Spec" !
Stewart and should advance at least
one contender to the liinals, if the
improvement shown in their victory
over Cal is any indicator.
Tom Dwyer Outstanding
Tom Dwyer, number one man on I
the varsity team and recent winner I
of the California Country Club invi- ,
tational tournament, should be the
outstanding Stanford competitor, I
chiefly by reason of that win. Tom i
has been coming into his own for |
some time, and he readily showed the '
golf that he is capable of when he
defeated Lawson Little on the latter's
homecoming last fall.
"Spec" Stewart, the number two
man, is coming into his prime de- 1
spite the fact that he had a bad day j
when the Cal men came down here
last week-end. Spec went to the
quarter-finals last year; shortly be
iore that he won the Southwestern 1
Amateur at Phoenix. He was medal- j
ist in the U.S. Amateur last fall also. !
Hoerner's Showing Uncertain
Jack Hoerner, who won the Ne- i
braska Amateur last summer, has
been off the past few weeks but is
just about due to get under way.
Jack has had a bad season, so any
thing he may do is a matter of con- ;
jecture. He is capable of champion
ship golf.
Don Edwards, who with Bob I
Thompson more or less walked off
with the hero's wreath in the Cali- i
fornia matches, should get under 1
way. Edwards won the medalist!
honors in the San Francisco City !
tournament and the California '
Country Club Invitational, and lost |
his early matches. It is just about j
time for Don to reverse the order 1
and win a tournament. His arch I
rival, Stew Hawley, former Stan- !
ford golfer, is the defending cham- I
pion. Edwards would like to avenge j
the defeat he suffered at Hawley's j
hands List summer at Del Monte; j
it cost him the state championship, j
The other Stanford tournament j
players should have some chance of i
breaking into the money. Bob j
Thompson and Max Stoddard both
seem to be at the top of their game.
Bill Hoelle, Wiffy Cox, Hugh Mel- !
lon, Jeeb Halaby may come in
the money if they enter.

Tom Dwyer Outstanding
Tom Dwyer, number one man on I
the varsity team and recent winner I
of the California Country Club invi- ,
tational tournament, should be the
outstanding Stanford competitor, I
chiefly by reason of that win. Tom i
has been coming into his own for |
some time, and he readily showed the '
golf that he is capable of when he
defeated Lawson Little on the latter's
homecoming last fall.
"Spec" Stewart, the number two
man, is coming into his prime de- 1
spite the fact that he had a bad day j
when the Cal men came down here
last week-end. Spec went to the
quarter-finals last year; shortly be
iore that he won the Southwestern 1
Amateur at Phoenix. He was medal- j
ist in the U.S. Amateur last fall also. !
Hoerner's Showing Uncertain
Jack Hoerner, who won the Ne- i
braska Amateur last summer, has
been off the past few weeks but is
just about due to get under way.
Jack has had a bad season, so any
thing he may do is a matter of con- ;
jecture. He is capable of champion
ship golf.
Don Edwards, who with Bob I
Thompson more or less walked off
with the hero's wreath in the Cali- i
fornia matches, should get under 1
way. Edwards won the medalist!
honors in the San Francisco City !
tournament and the California '
Country Club Invitational, and lost |
his early matches. It is just about j
time for Don to reverse the order 1
and win a tournament. His arch I
rival, Stew Hawley, former Stan- !
ford golfer, is the defending cham- I
pion. Edwards would like to avenge j
the defeat he suffered at Hawley's j
hands List summer at Del Monte; j
it cost him the state championship, j
The other Stanford tournament j
players should have some chance of i
breaking into the money. Bob j
Thompson and Max Stoddard both
seem to be at the top of their game.
Bill Hoelle, Wiffy Cox, Hugh Mel- !
lon, Jeeb Halaby may come in
the money if they enter.
With the California matches safely
won, the • Stanford golf teams, both
freshman and varsity, started prac
tice with the Northern California
Amateur tournament as their goal.
The event will be played on the San
Francisco Country Club links on
April 2G.
Stanford made a great bid for it
last year in the person of "Spec" !
Stewart and should advance at least
one contender to the liinals, if the
improvement shown in their victory
over Cal is any indicator.
