TAIHOKU. Formosa, April 21 (/P).
â€”The beautiful Japanese island of
Formosa was a shambles of twisted
ruin and death tonight in the wake
of an earthquake and fire which,
according to the latest official fig
ures, claimed 2495 lives.
The figures had 5770 injured, most
ly Chinese peasants; 12,122 houses
destroyed, and 11,340 structures
damaged.
The complete toll was expected to
reach even greater proportions, since
telephone and telegraph communi
cations were cut off from many of
the inland districts of mountainout
Formosa, making it impossible to
gather full details.
Worst Since 1923
The tragedy was the worst in
Japanese territory since the 1923
earthquake, which devastated Tokyo
and Yokohama with a loss of almost
.100,000 lives.'
The entire main sti'eet in Taichu
city was demolished and the city of
Taiku was virtually destroyed.
Throughout the northwestern por
tion of the island railroad tracks
buckled into fantastic waves like
writhing snakes and many elaborate
mountain tunnels caved in.
Injured Block Roads
Roads to Taichu were blocked by
processions of improvised stretchers
and crude litters bearing the injured
to places where medical attention
would be available.
Wailing women and terrified chil
dren clogged the highways, making
passage for the injured difficult.
Terrified children clung to the legs
of their fathers and mothers, im
ploring officials who attempted to
marshal them into some semblance
of order not to be separated from
relatives.
Every available doctor from the
army and the Red Cross medical
unit was brought from all parts of
the island to the areas where need
was greatest. Doctors and nurses
toiled throughout the day amid the
debris of collapsed huts to relieve
the sufferings of victims.
Fire Adds Horror
The towns of Naioshow, Kameok,
and Shimizufiai were the most af
fected. An oil field in this district
was racked to pieces, loosing a gush
er which caught fire, adding to the
terror of the stricken inhabitants.
The island of Formosa, which has
a population of nearly 5,000,000 per
sons, was acquired by Japan in the
Sino-Japanese war of 1895. It lies
between the Southern and Eastern
China seas, and is separated from
the Chinese Province of Fukien (on
the mainland) by a strait that is
nearly 90 miles across at its nar
rowest point.
The population is largely Chinese,
although there are many Aborigines
there, and Japanese business men
and their families. The island is
ruled by a Japanese governor.
