# Plans Progress For Decorations At Masque Ball
## Acres of Cloth Will Convert Encina Pavilion Into 'Royal' Palace Campus Talent Scheduled For Entertainment 
### 
Decorations that should draw
longer and louder "ohV 'and "ah's"
than any heard before are promised
for the Masque Ball Friday night by
Robert Elfving, decorations chair
man.
Picture the Encina Pavilion as it is.
Then think of it with a ceiling of
colored drapes, with drops of deep
black velour covering the bleachers,
and ends of the hall concealed by
"flitter sets," which turn out to be
merely cloth covered by pieces of
glass, with special lights to convert
everything into a shimmering mass.
Ed Stirms To Play
Ed Stirms' 12-piece orchestra will
hold forth at the north end of the
Pavilion, and at the other will sit
campus king and queen, elected
benevolent despots for the evening.
An elaborate illumination system
will convert the dancing throng into
'a human artist's palette.
Campus talent will supplement
professional entertainment features.
A campus co-ed trio, singing, of
course, includes Philura Graham,
Frances Terrell, and Margot Leland.
Eleanor Harris, abducted queen of
last year, will aid Jim Copp in the
coronation ceremonies. Don Geggie,
Phil Delt songster, promises a vocal
number.
Tickets Sell Fast
Meanwhile, tickets are selling fast
[at A.S.S.U. offices at $2 per. Those
'who plan "being in the swim"—and
: who doesnt?—should make their
purchases early, warns Bob Church,
committee chairman.
Even costumes, or the lack of
them, will be no obstacle to attend
ance this year. A San Francisco
costumer will maintain a wide se
lection of fancy dress attire in the
A.S.S.U. committee room starting at
noon today, and continuing through
the week until the Pavilion doors
