# Get Programs, Seniors Urged
## 
### 
1 Since this is the final week during
| which senior programs and an
i nouncements may be ordered, the
j senior program committee urges all
members of the Class of '35 to place
their orders immediately at the
A.S.S.U. office. A check-up has re
vealed that there are many seniors
1 who have not yet filled out order
; blanks.
Display cards bearing samples of
| both programs and announcements
| have been posted on the bulletin
boards at the Administration Build
; ing. The printed copies will be ready
| for distribution by the first of June.
The committee is emphasizing the
point that this year announcements
are being sent out simply as an
nouncements of graduation and not
!as implicat ions for gifts. Announce
ments, which are printed with sepia
I ink and bear the Stanford seal, sell
j for 10 cents apiece.
