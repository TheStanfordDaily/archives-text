# Auto Wheel To Support Stage for 'Yellow Jack'
## 
### BUD BRILL 
That hoary question, "What makes
the wheels go 'round?" usually ap
plied in derision to model T Fords
and Phi Betes, takes on a new con
notation in the forthcoming produc
tion of "Yellow Jack." For ihe elab
orate set, nearing completion, fea
tures a revolving stage, supported
and moved by the wide wheel of a
1935 Ford.
George Andreini, technical direc
tor. Is responsible for the ingenious
device. "The local dealer told us,"
ho said, "that the wheel will sup
port a weight of 20 tons, and we're
going to put it to a practical test,
as the weightiest action takes place
on this super-stage."

Then, he and his staff modestly
[admitted that the set will compare
favorably to that of the Broadway
production and that it is probably
the most modern and unusual set
ever to be viewed from the uncom
fortable seats of the doomed asscm

The interviewer was addedly im
i pressed when told that the total cost
iwas less than $72.03. This amount,
' further, must cover all lighting,
make-up, and costuming expenses.
This is because so much of the pro
duction budget, under the present
dramatic set-up, must go to pay va
rious student and faculty salaries.
In fact, only one-sixth of the money
goes for actual stage expenses.
