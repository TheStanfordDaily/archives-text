## Ten-Day Campaign Will End May 1; Funds Come From Many Sources 
### 
With the slogan, "Stanford's Own,"
Convalescent Home Drive commit
teemen are starting the busy .veek
and a half of Convalescent Home
Activities today, appealing to Stan
ford students to help the needy
children at the Home back to health
and happiness.
First event on the calendar is to
night, when heads of the major com
mittees are guests at a dinner given
by Professor and Mrs. Payson J.
Treat. Tonight's dinner will be a
send-off for the nine days of work
ahead.
Labor Day Committee
Already the movement has been
started. Mill Luhman's Labor Day
committee has been busy building a
permanent concrete barbecue, un
dertaken on its own initiative, while
yesterday the Chi Omega house
treated the 70 children to an Easter
egg hunt.
Wednesday the Masque Ball King
and Queen Contest ends.
Thursday the men's and women's
speakers will visit the different
groups, voicing the appeal for help
for the children.
On Friday there will be the Junior
Water Carnival and the Masque Ball,
at which the king and queen will
reign.
Bean Day and Strawberry Br.unch
will be on Monday, April 29, when
Stanford students eat beans and ap
ples to save money for the Home.
Labor Day
The Ping Pong finals are on the
following Tuesday, and the climax
of the drive comes on Wednesday,
May 1, which Ls the historic Labor
Day. Afternoon classes will be dis
missed, while the Stanford campus
moves out to the Home to work, the
women painting toys, and doing light,
work, and the men flexing their
muscles on the heavier labor.
After the work is over comes the
barbecue and after the barbecue
comes the jolly-up. And after it is
all over there will be a sum of mon
ey to contribute to the activities of
the Home, which the committeemen
arc hoping will indicate the large
helping hand that Stanford extends
to the unfortunates.
