# Bear Trackmen End Winning Streak of Cards; Score 77-53
## Upsets in Several Events Mark Indian Defeat Before 18,000 POLLOCK OUT OF MEET Dean Broad Jumps 24 Feet, Places in Sprints 
### Warren Breed 
Eleven times California track
teams had tried to beat Stanford,
and eleven times they had failed.
But on the dozenth, victory was
brought to Berkeley.
The score was — Stanford
California 77' 2.
Mushy Pollock, who was singled
out as the chance for Bear victory,
did not compete. But Fitzgerald,
and Fink, and Landon, and Thomp
son, and Fishback, and Vallejo did,
and they were the boys who camo
through to completely shuffle the
Cards.
Eighteen thousand spectators who
saw the meet and the 80-odd thin
elads took part in real drama.
Dixon Takes Mile
Stanford fans cheered lustily when
little Warren Dixon beat out big
Bob Heavey by the width of his
jersey in the mile, the first event.
They couldn't stop cheering when
Chuck Voigt and Ray Dean (good
boy) took second and third behind
George Anderson in the 100.
And it was swell when A1 Black
man and Truck Dellinger came
through in the 440, and when Sammy
Klopstock ran the prettiest race of
the day in the highs, and when Dave
Devlin pattered home ahead of
Voorhces in the two-mile—ah yes,
California would certainly have to
wait another year to win her Big
Meet.
In the field, too, everything was
jake. Jim Reynolds was beating
Mackey in the shot, and Johnny
Mottram and Dud Sales were lead
ing in the javelin, John at 209 feet
and Dud at 202. And Humbert Smith
in the high jump, andl Phil Levy in
the discus, were going to win.
Mottram Beaten
Then it began to happen. George
Fink, tall Bear, unwound a toss of
his spear that approached Johnny's.
"Wow," yelled Cal fans. Norman
Fitzgerald, a smaller Bear, shot one
out, and Sales was now fourth. Fitz
had two more throws, and Johnny
was all through. In those two throws
—well, Johnny came out second, and
couldn't do a thing about it.
But that wasn't all. Johnny Lan
don, a veteran Cal scrub, outdid
himself and followed Dick Brace
home to leave Rusty March, Indian
hope, in third. In the high jump,
Stanford's game Humbert Smith
found his take-off ankle too weak,
and more points filtered through to
the Bears. The same .story in the
pole vault; Mauger and Haskell
[went too high for the improving
| Tini Ginn of Stanford.
California's come-through per
! formers became heroes, but Stan-
I ford also had her boys who did
themselves proud.
Vallejo, Dean in Ti«
Ray Dean made up for a whole
bad season. He jumped more than
a foot farther than he ever had be
fore, tieing Cal's graceful Eddie Val
lejo. Ho beat out fast Jim Helmer
j for second in the 220, and took third
in the 100.
His friend Warren Dixon did a
| beautiful job of waxing the long
gaited Berkeley boy, Heavey.
Dave Devlin ran the best two
j mile of his life in beating Los Voor
hces. He did about 9.44 —a memor
able climax to his collegiate career.
Sam Klopstock dwarfed the Beats
Moore and Wood in the highs—a
great race in record-equalling time
of 14.5.
