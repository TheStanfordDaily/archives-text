# School Spirit At the Big Meet Saturday
## 
### 
A most pitiful display of Stanford students'
lack of enthusiasm and school spirit, and the
disgraceful absence of any sort ol a yell leader
or rooting section organizer was seen at the
lfig Meet at Herkeley Saturday. Not a yell and
hardly a sound of encouragement was uttered
by Stanford rooters.
California's student body rallied round in
Iron! of the Cardinal section alter their first
victory in 12 years, rooted, sang songs, and
waited expectantly for a Stanford response
from a rooting section which was discourte
ously filing out.
In desperation, or at least in sympathy, the
California veil-leaders turned around and led
Stanford in its own yells. The Cold and Blue
was courteous, yet disgusted with a Cardinal
section without even a yell-leader of its own.
Their disgust was justified.
Crowning disgrace of the day was not the
lact that Stanford was defeated, as a victory
won by California is no disgrace, but the fact
that the Stanford hymn was not sung. Cali
fornia's "Alma Mater" lloated over Edwards
field and the students remained silent for
Stanford's hymn. A few loyal Stanford men
yelled for the hymn. There was no one to lead
it. The band didn't play it or sound a chord.
Instead Stanford suffered itself to walk out
with hanging head and shamed face.
