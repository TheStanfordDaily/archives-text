# A 						German Painter Has a Birthday
## 
### 
Adolph Hi Her celebrated his birthday last
Saturday. To fourteen nations he handed a
short, curt note. It was not a very pleasant
piece of composition. It had decidedly nasty
implications.
The note was first made public in Rome,
although it was sent to all the ministers of
the nations who are participating in the
(ieneva deliberations.
Paper-hanger Adolph llatly criticized the
League of Nations Council's condemnation of
Germany's rearmament. His government, said
Hitler, contests the right of the other govern
ments which took part in the deliberation of
April 17 to make themselves judges over Ger
many. He further snid that the German gov
ernment saw, in the Council's action, discrimi
nation against Germany, and therefore in ab
solute manner Germany rejects it.
Forty-six years of life in a war-ridden
world, and power-loving Hitler now stands
e\aetlf where he wanted to be. No man above
him, the main fulcrum in a chain of circum
stances which he can alter to sleep Europe
in war, and comic-looking Hitler knows that
the fate of millions rests in his neurotic frame.
A grandstand politician, an impassioned ora
tor, Hitler sends notes to the fourteen nations,
knowing that the shoe pinches hard, and that
there isn't much the League can actually do.
The minister of propaganda said to his
countrymen on the day of Hitler's birthday:
"The entire nation loves him because it feels
sale in his arms like a child in its mother's
arms." The spectacle of an intelligent German
walking up to Goebbels, author of the remark,
and saying, "We do not love Hitler, we do not
feel sale in 1 iis arms," is ridiculous. He would
be beheaded before the day was over, test his
words leak out of the censor-ridden country
and an outside nation learn something it
didn't already know. .Just so ridiculous is the
European situation, where one man mocks
fourteen other nations because he knows that
he is King of the Mountain, for the lime being.
Perhaps Hitler may "save Germany." Hut
how many other countries' security may be
threatened before the Bcichsfuehrer cele
brates another birthdav?
