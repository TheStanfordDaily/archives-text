# 'Rough' Traveler Writes of Globe Trotting to Daily
## 
### 
Appearing on the editorial
page at regular intervals from
today on will be a series of ar
ticles entitled "Travels of a
Stanford Hough."
Its author, Grant Leibert,
Stanford sophomore, is starting
on a trip that may carry him
around the world, and into
many little-visited cities and
countries.
Three years ago, a similar se
ries of articles appeared in the
Stanford Daily under the col
umn "Windjammer," written
by a Stanford student, who re
layed his impressions of ocean
travel, the Orient and Europe
to the Farm in every issue of
The Daily.
Leibert s new column is par
ticularly interesting now in
view of expected revolution in
Mcxico, the Chaco trouble in
South America, and the strained
relations on the Continent.
Look for the first of the series
on the third page today.
