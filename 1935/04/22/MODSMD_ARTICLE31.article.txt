# Getting Used to Paly Enforcement
## 
### 
l-'ear of the much-touted and much-cussed
enforcement of the Palo Alto traffic regula
tions gradually dies down in the mind of the
Stanford Rouuh. He is becoming accustomed

to tht* strict rulings and now takes them for
granted.
Acceptance by him and by the other mem
bers of the adjoining communities of this rigid
observation of the laws lias aided the police
in cutting the number of accidents down to a
favorably low figure for the past two years.
The Hough now looks back with a smile to
the time when the laws, first put into ellcct,
brought forth strong condemnation from him.
He remembers how he and the rest of the
members of his living group gathered after
those first days of strict enforcement and
cussed the police department. He bitterly re
members working on the wood pile for a vio
lation.
With the passing of time and the examining
of results, the Hough discovers* that it was
not so bad alter all. It just took a little lime,
he discovered, to accustomed to it. After
that orientation period was oyer, he felt that
a trip to Palo Alto was no longer a certain bet
for an arrest.
Visitors and shoppers to the city also com
plained about the strict enforcement. They
vowed not to come back. Hut they were in the
minority and they did return.
Persistent carrying out of the laws has made
the city much safer, accident figures reveal,
and has created respect for the police depart
ment and for the laws. A transferring of that
constant and rigid enforcement to the other
laws of the nation would undoubtedly produce
that reverence and respect that the Stanford
Hough has for the Palo Afto traffic laws.
