## SLAVERY—1935 MODEL 
### CROMPTON BANGS, Jr 
BOSTON, April 17. —In school we were taught ihat
Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation freed all the
slaves and ended slavery forever in the U.S. While
the type of slavery pictured in "Uncle Tom's Cabin"
is gone for good, something just as bad has been with
us for a long time and is getting worse all the time.
That something is the miserable lot of the South's
share-croppers.
All around the rich cotton lands, especially in Ar
kansas, eastern Texas, Mississippi, and Louisiana the
hated system has existed for generations. About 3,000,-
000 people work the land owned by the landlord, get
half the crop they raise, in the meanwhile buying on
credit at the landlord's store. They seldom see real
cash; even with 16-cent cotton a family was lucky to
get as much as $400 a year. Many got less, so had less
to eat, and practically nothing to wear.
But that's not all. The share-croppers' first cash
never comes in until the fall. During at least half of
the year they have to live on the credit granted by
the landlord, which rarely exceeds $10-$25 a month.
Out of this they have to pay interest (usually 10 per
cent or over) on the credit, besides buying what food
they can at prices often a third higher than those
chai'ged at regular groceries. Of necessity the main
diet is cornbread, salt pork and beans. Pellagra,
malaria, malnutrition, and tuberculosis are so common
as to be the rule rather than the exception.
The New Deal's AAA was supposed to utter
the magic words and do away with the evils of
the system by passing the crop reduction benefits
right down to the share-croppers. After all, they
work 80 per cent of the cotton land and were en
titled to it. But the AAA has made things worse
instead of better.
Most of the crop reduction money and rental for
retired land has been pocketed by the land-owners,
though the honest minority have tried to see that
their tenants got what was theirs. Meanwhile, the
NRA has furnished an excuse for higher food and
clothing prices at the stores. Besides the New Deal's
crop reduction policy has apparently served to reduce
the United States' share of the world cotton market
—probably for. good—which makes things look even
worse than they have been in the past.
There is nothing the share-croppers can do. Mem
bers of the Tenant Farms Union have been systematic
ally murdered or driven out of the county by local
officials. These defend their actions on the ground
they are saving the South from Communism —which
is bunk.
The South has much more to fear from itself
than from Moscow. The longer this system con
tinues under the present set-up with degenerate
landlords and crooked insurance companies own
ing the I'Wid the more chance there will be of real
bloody revolution. If and when this comes, the
New Deal will have done more than its share
toward causing the knock-down and drag-out fight
between the Haves and the Have-Nots.
A situation like this is fertile ground for any dema
gogue—Huey Long in particular. If things get much
worse and the tenants can afford to pay their poll tax
of $1 a head and up. the Kingfish might carry five or
six Southern states ii* 1936. Of course his Share-the-
Wealth wouldn't help the share-croppers a bit.
The problem is something entirely different. It
consists partly of New Deal blundering and partly of
the lack of common honesty and common sense in a
place where they were traditionally supposed to have
been. Give the share-croppers honest landlords and a
cotton policy that doesn't cut its own throat and they
will be more than half-way out of their troubles.
