Since Our Hasher mentioned the canoe-upsetting
' episode last week about four or five canoes have over-
I turned in Lake Lagunita, but I refuse to be taken in.

strictly anonymous.
Stanford's latest sacrifice to Hollywood is a local
i affiliate of Delta Gamma and a graduate of the Paly
high school. As a consequence, the staid college town
has been going quite agog over her picture, which is
J now appearing downtown.
j The local theater manager has put the name of
t Palo Alto's darling in large type in the ads, one of
the Daily's reviewers assures me he saw the actress
walk in to see her picture with the boy friend the
J other night, and now the news is bruited about that
she is to appear on the stage in person (not a moving
picture) tonight. Within a few more days, our local girl
who made good should know how to look and act like
herself when ihe Deegees have their rushing teas
next fall.
There's a big scandal raging through the Chi O
house. One of the girls woke up to find a dark form
creeping up the fire escape to the sleeping porch.
After the usual formalities of screaming and hiding
heads beneath blankets were dispensed with, it turned
i out that the dark form was one of the girls who had
lost her key and was coming in a wee bit late. What
chagrined the girls most, though, was that the dark
form was also an old grad who could not be dealt
I with in the usual manner.
