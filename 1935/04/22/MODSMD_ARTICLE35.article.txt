# BULL SESSION
## HAVE YOU A LITTLE CRISIS IN YOUR HOME? 
### 
There was a time when newspa
per readers could pick up (he morn
ing gazette and read a plain news
story. The story may not have been
a thriller; it could be read without
the aid of aromatic spirits of am
monia; but still it was news, im
portant news.
For Americans, at least, that day
is gone. There are no longer news
papers, but crisis-papers. Every
thing is a crisis. The laying of a
corner-stone: that is a crisis. The
latest divorce case: that is a crisis.
The appendix of a movie star: even
that is a crisis. If a thing not a
crisis—not even a little crisis—it's
not fit to print. And since news
papers must be large in order to
hold lots of advertising, the annual
crisis crop is simply staggering.
There are many happenings, es
sentially not racy, and still of great
consequence: the details of treaty
negotiation, the business of congress,
etc. But such events must compete
for reader —attention with the muck
of the back-alley and the perfumed,
filth cf the boudoir. To build circu
lation, to increase profits, the modern
newspaper panders to the animal in
stincts: thus the great play given the
Dionne quintuplets. With the read
er's journalistic tastes reduced to the
emotional level, a sober news story
is naturally unappetizing. Hence, like
the sober Calvin Coolidge, a sober
news story must don ten-gallon hat
and cowboy chaps. The results are
appalling.
There would be little objection to

| the jazzing up of the news, if the
j fundamental rhythm of truth were
1 retained. But even in stories which
J a newspaper has no particular desire
! to falsify, the truth finds tough sled
j/ding over the rocks of "spice" and
."thrills." To lend color to a news
j paper story, facts are lifted out of
i their logical sequence, misquotation
, is glorified, and wild headlines cover
j the whole with an air of emphatic
| authority.
i %
I Having accustomed the public to
! reading and believing that which is
i thrillingly written, the press pro
! ceeds to use the "thrill-crisis" form
j ula to foist its pet schemes upon
j the populace.
j The late lamented Mr. Sinclair
j was a mild sort of a man. But
j masked with red whiskers, and
dramatized as a fire-breather. Mr.
) Sinclair became a "thrill," and his
* Epic plan a "crisis." Months later,
Mr. Merriam is now turning to the
! Sinclair remedies. The crisis was a
hoax.
j According to the press, San Fran
-i Cisco now faces a crisis: to build the
j fair oti the shoals, or not to build
;the fair on the shoals. Having failed
tc get the fair on the shoals by in
| telligent argument, the fair will now
be "crisised" on to the mud flats of
! Yerba Buena.
Dragged from crisis to super
crisis and back to crisis again, the
public is left in a , perpetual fer
fment; real issues are overlooked.
When we learn when a crisis is not
I a crisis there will be some hope that
j we may tackle the real crises.
