PRIVATE WORLDS"
At the Stanford Theater
"I'm, crazy! I'm crazy! I'm crazy!
I'm reviewing a movie about an in
sane asylum and I'm crazy!"

And so will
you be (and
like it), after
seeing Stanford's
Jean Rouverol
portray the role
of pathetic "Car
rie Flint" in this
fine production

of Phyllis Bottome's novel, "Private
Worlds." Although Miss Rouverol
has but a minor part, it is evidence
of her excellent work that her per
formance runs through one's mind
even after the superb portrayals of
Charles Boyer and Claudette Colbert
have dropped into the background.
Don't miss this picture if you can
help it.
