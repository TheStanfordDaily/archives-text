The Editor. Sir:
Last Saturday afternoon Edwards
Field, at the University of California,
was the scene of the Big Meet. On
the east side of the field the Cali
fornia rooters, under the able and
enei'getic leadership of two excel
lent yell leaders, gave cheer alter
cheer for their men.
On the other side of the field the
Stanford rooters — and there were
plenty qf them—saw Warren Dixon
win a heart-breaking mile, saw
Sam Klopstock take' the high hur
dles, and saw all the others doing
their best; yet never a cheer was
given.
I think that every Stanford rooter
wished to show his appreciation by
some concerted yells, but none were
given—there were no yell leaders.
Throughout the whole afternoon we
were forced to sit and watch our
team put up a game fight without
being able to show any spirit or en
couragement whatsoever.
Finally, when the meet was over
and the California students had as
sembled before us to round off the
day with a few more yells, the Cal
yell leaders, having noted our sad
predicament, thoughtfully proceeded
to lead the Stanford rooters in a
yell for the Stanford varsity.
Our thanks to California yell lead
ers—but what should we give to our
own yell leaders?
