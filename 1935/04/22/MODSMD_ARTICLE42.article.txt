# TRAVELS OF A STANFORD ROUGH
## 
### GRANT LEIBERT 
En route Los Angeles-Tuscon.
Never having traveled on a trans
continental bus and having heard
many superlative descriptions of the
Arizona desert sunrise, I decided to
gratify two desires with one master
stroke. Nine-thirty p.m. found me
boarding the Tucson stage with high
expectations of some seven hours
of sleep to be interrupted only by
the majestic heralding of the day;
at 2:o0 a.m. I was still awaiting
sleep to overtake me as I silently
and severely cursed each bump that
tortured my cramped, aching body.
Needless to say, my interest in sun
rises, of any kind, anywhere, had
been materially lessened, and it was
without regret that I perceived the
sun well in the heavens when I
awakened from what seemed but a
blink of the eye.
In relating the hardships of the
present age I shall never fail to
tell my grandchildren how I
crossed practically half the conti
nent 011 a bus, which had been
constructed for the purpose of
transporting pigmies to and from
the East African coal mines.
But all was not dull and dreary.
My fellow passengers were soon pre
cipitated into one happy family. Led
by two sailors and a gentleman from
Tennessee, they formed a transient
chapter of Cult Bacchanal, which
soon proved itself woi % thy of affilia
tion with that honorable Greek or
der. Indeed, I do not doubt that it
considerably surpassed the gayest
exhibitions of Hellenistic revelry,
Alas! before the merrymakers had
reached a climax, a new driver took
the wheel. He must have been a
holdover from another regime, for
he forthwith enacted a repeal of all
liquor, laughter, and light-hearted
ness. There can be no party, at
least not in a bus, without the grape;
and so for another attempt at sleep.
Florence,
A typical Arizona rest-stop! No
beer on ice. Out of Coco Cola. Slot
machine not working (as you dis
cover after depositing coin). The
women wear pink, yellowy or baby
blue di esses and rouge their eye-lids
as well as their cheeks. The dogs
move only to chase off a fly. The
men don't even do that.
All automobile drives up for
gasoline, and grandma alone gets
up to attempt to fill the tank. In
trying to get the nozzle of the hose
placed properly, she sprays car,
self, and whomever happens to he
nearby with liberal quantities of
fuel. She allows the t'Uik to
overflow while she is murmuring
apologies. . The driver asks her
what he owes. After a lengthy con
sultation with the rest of family.
Grandma informs him. He ob
jects to the high price. Grandma,
a little irritated now, says sharply
that it must he fetched all the way
from town. The driver still com
plains, but p iys. He drives off in
a rage, and we follow him very
much amused.

[ Tucson.
It was rot Tucson, the modern
city, the capital of the sunshine belt,
the educational center of the South
! wet., or the "Home City," which at
-1 Iracled me. I saw only the spacious
valley floor, bounded by mountains
ol' every side, where, less than a i
I century ago, Geronimo, the famous j
; warchief, rode at the head of his
avenging Apache warriors. As my ;
horse threaded his way through the j
i maze of variegated cacti, I could j
! imagine the dry river beds and j
gulches vomiting forth hordes of
' blood-thirsty Indians, intent on ex
piating the many transgressions of
their life, liberty and pursuit of hap
piness.
Over those mountains, the Santa j
Ritas, the Rineons, and the Cata- j
1 linas, came first the lone explorer, !
then the prospector, and finally the ,
winding caravans of covered wagons. I
Men and women killed, toiled, lusted
and lived that they might produce a {
| city. It was ?lso here, though long
; before a city had appeared, that i
Billy the Kid, Doc Halliday and a |
I host of others would slake their
' thirst after a long desert ride, yes, j
even as I would like to be doing.
Inasmuch as I was a stranger
in town and a sort of a tourist to j
j boot, there was 110 possibility of j
relaxation until I had seen the |
| Missions, Forts, Courthouse, caves, I
I canyons, parks, rivers, and every- j
tiling else which makes touring so
ducky. If you've ever been to 1
Tucson, you've been dragged ten
miles across the desert to see j
Mission San Xavier Del Bac, "the I
most beautiful and best preserved j
of the old Spanish missions," "the
Taj Mahal of the desert." *
And you will remember the expla- i
j nation everyone gave for the one in- j
completed tower — that the Indian j
attacks became so dangerous, work j
j had to be suspended on the last j
remaining unit. I, too, heard this |
: story and believed it until I later 1
| discovered a more plausible reason. !
The king of Spain decreed that all 1
buildings, when finished, must pay j
1 taxes to the crown. Hence, the as
-1 lute Fathers, in order to evade these !
excessive taxes, left the towers un- 1
I finished on many of their missions. !
Nor did surcease come with the j
j night. I had to put a stiff collar on j
j my poor sunburned neck and go a- j
! partying. As you may have guessed, I
I was no longer confusing myself j
with Geronimo or Billy the Kid, not j
j after having ridden horseback six
hours for the first time in more than i
a year.

[ Tucson.
It was rot Tucson, the modern
city, the capital of the sunshine belt,
the educational center of the South
! wet., or the "Home City," which at
-1 Iracled me. I saw only the spacious
valley floor, bounded by mountains
ol' every side, where, less than a i
I century ago, Geronimo, the famous j
; warchief, rode at the head of his
avenging Apache warriors. As my ;
horse threaded his way through the j
i maze of variegated cacti, I could j
! imagine the dry river beds and j
gulches vomiting forth hordes of
' blood-thirsty Indians, intent on ex
piating the many transgressions of
their life, liberty and pursuit of hap
piness.
Over those mountains, the Santa j
Ritas, the Rineons, and the Cata- j
1 linas, came first the lone explorer, !
then the prospector, and finally the ,
winding caravans of covered wagons. I
Men and women killed, toiled, lusted
and lived that they might produce a {

; before a city had appeared, that i
Billy the Kid, Doc Halliday and a |
I host of others would slake their
' thirst after a long desert ride, yes, j
even as I would like to be doing.
Inasmuch as I was a stranger
in town and a sort of a tourist to j
j boot, there was 110 possibility of j
relaxation until I had seen the |
| Missions, Forts, Courthouse, caves, I
I canyons, parks, rivers, and every- j
tiling else which makes touring so
ducky. If you've ever been to 1
Tucson, you've been dragged ten
miles across the desert to see j
Mission San Xavier Del Bac, "the I
most beautiful and best preserved j
of the old Spanish missions," "the
Taj Mahal of the desert." *
And you will remember the expla- i
j nation everyone gave for the one in- j

I Tomorrow—On to Mexico.
En route Los Angeles-Tuscon.
Never having traveled on a trans
continental bus and having heard
many superlative descriptions of the
Arizona desert sunrise, I decided to
gratify two desires with one master
stroke. Nine-thirty p.m. found me
boarding the Tucson stage with high
expectations of some seven hours
of sleep to be interrupted only by
the majestic heralding of the day;
at 2:o0 a.m. I was still awaiting
sleep to overtake me as I silently
and severely cursed each bump that
tortured my cramped, aching body.
Needless to say, my interest in sun
rises, of any kind, anywhere, had
been materially lessened, and it was
without regret that I perceived the
sun well in the heavens when I
awakened from what seemed but a
blink of the eye.
In relating the hardships of the
present age I shall never fail to
tell my grandchildren how I
crossed practically half the conti
nent 011 a bus, which had been
constructed for the purpose of
transporting pigmies to and from
the East African coal mines.
But all was not dull and dreary.
My fellow passengers were soon pre
cipitated into one happy family. Led
by two sailors and a gentleman from
Tennessee, they formed a transient
chapter of Cult Bacchanal, which
soon proved itself woi % thy of affilia
tion with that honorable Greek or
der. Indeed, I do not doubt that it
considerably surpassed the gayest
exhibitions of Hellenistic revelry,
Alas! before the merrymakers had
reached a climax, a new driver took
the wheel. He must have been a
holdover from another regime, for
he forthwith enacted a repeal of all
liquor, laughter, and light-hearted
ness. There can be no party, at
least not in a bus, without the grape;
and so for another attempt at sleep.
Florence,
A typical Arizona rest-stop! No
beer on ice. Out of Coco Cola. Slot
machine not working (as you dis
cover after depositing coin). The
women wear pink, yellowy or baby
blue di esses and rouge their eye-lids
as well as their cheeks. The dogs
move only to chase off a fly. The
men don't even do that.
All automobile drives up for
gasoline, and grandma alone gets
up to attempt to fill the tank. In
trying to get the nozzle of the hose

overflow while she is murmuring

I Tomorrow—On to Mexico.
En route Los Angeles-Tuscon.
Never having traveled on a trans
continental bus and having heard
many superlative descriptions of the
Arizona desert sunrise, I decided to
gratify two desires with one master
stroke. Nine-thirty p.m. found me
boarding the Tucson stage with high
expectations of some seven hours
of sleep to be interrupted only by
the majestic heralding of the day;
at 2:o0 a.m. I was still awaiting
sleep to overtake me as I silently
and severely cursed each bump that
tortured my cramped, aching body.
Needless to say, my interest in sun
rises, of any kind, anywhere, had
been materially lessened, and it was
without regret that I perceived the
sun well in the heavens when I
awakened from what seemed but a
blink of the eye.
In relating the hardships of the
present age I shall never fail to
tell my grandchildren how I
crossed practically half the conti
nent 011 a bus, which had been
constructed for the purpose of
transporting pigmies to and from
the East African coal mines.
But all was not dull and dreary.
My fellow passengers were soon pre
cipitated into one happy family. Led
by two sailors and a gentleman from
Tennessee, they formed a transient
chapter of Cult Bacchanal, which
soon proved itself woi % thy of affilia
tion with that honorable Greek or
der. Indeed, I do not doubt that it
considerably surpassed the gayest
exhibitions of Hellenistic revelry,
Alas! before the merrymakers had
reached a climax, a new driver took
the wheel. He must have been a
holdover from another regime, for
he forthwith enacted a repeal of all
liquor, laughter, and light-hearted
ness. There can be no party, at
least not in a bus, without the grape;
and so for another attempt at sleep.
Florence,
A typical Arizona rest-stop! No
beer on ice. Out of Coco Cola. Slot
machine not working (as you dis
cover after depositing coin). The
women wear pink, yellowy or baby
blue di esses and rouge their eye-lids
as well as their cheeks. The dogs
move only to chase off a fly. The
men don't even do that.
All automobile drives up for
gasoline, and grandma alone gets
up to attempt to fill the tank. In
trying to get the nozzle of the hose
placed properly, she sprays car,
self, and whomever happens to he
nearby with liberal quantities of
fuel. She allows the t'Uik to
overflow while she is murmuring
apologies. . The driver asks her
what he owes. After a lengthy con
sultation with the rest of family.
Grandma informs him. He ob
jects to the high price. Grandma,
a little irritated now, says sharply
that it must he fetched all the way
from town. The driver still com
plains, but p iys. He drives off in
a rage, and we follow him very
much amused.

[ Tucson.
It was rot Tucson, the modern
city, the capital of the sunshine belt,
the educational center of the South
! wet., or the "Home City," which at
-1 Iracled me. I saw only the spacious
valley floor, bounded by mountains
ol' every side, where, less than a i
I century ago, Geronimo, the famous j
; warchief, rode at the head of his
avenging Apache warriors. As my ;
horse threaded his way through the j
i maze of variegated cacti, I could j
! imagine the dry river beds and j
gulches vomiting forth hordes of
' blood-thirsty Indians, intent on ex
piating the many transgressions of
their life, liberty and pursuit of hap
piness.
Over those mountains, the Santa j
Ritas, the Rineons, and the Cata- j
1 linas, came first the lone explorer, !
then the prospector, and finally the ,
winding caravans of covered wagons. I
Men and women killed, toiled, lusted
and lived that they might produce a {
| city. It was ?lso here, though long
; before a city had appeared, that i
Billy the Kid, Doc Halliday and a |
I host of others would slake their
' thirst after a long desert ride, yes, j
even as I would like to be doing.
Inasmuch as I was a stranger
in town and a sort of a tourist to j
j boot, there was 110 possibility of j
relaxation until I had seen the |
| Missions, Forts, Courthouse, caves, I
I canyons, parks, rivers, and every- j
tiling else which makes touring so
ducky. If you've ever been to 1
Tucson, you've been dragged ten
miles across the desert to see j
Mission San Xavier Del Bac, "the I
most beautiful and best preserved j
of the old Spanish missions," "the
Taj Mahal of the desert." *
And you will remember the expla- i
j nation everyone gave for the one in- j
completed tower — that the Indian j
attacks became so dangerous, work j
j had to be suspended on the last j
remaining unit. I, too, heard this |
: story and believed it until I later 1
| discovered a more plausible reason. !
The king of Spain decreed that all 1
buildings, when finished, must pay j
1 taxes to the crown. Hence, the as
-1 lute Fathers, in order to evade these !
excessive taxes, left the towers un- 1
I finished on many of their missions. !
Nor did surcease come with the j
j night. I had to put a stiff collar on j
j my poor sunburned neck and go a- j
! partying. As you may have guessed, I
I was no longer confusing myself j
with Geronimo or Billy the Kid, not j
