# Relay Gives Bear Cubs Little-Big Meet Victory
## U.C. BABES DOWN FROSH TRACKMEN BY 67-64 SCORE Shot Put Mark Smashed By Jim Kitts of Cal 
### Gordon Frost 
In an even more heartbreaking i
upset than the Big Meet of Saturday,
Stanford's frosh track .squad went ;
down to defeat before California ■
frosh in their annual Little Big
Meet Friday afternoon — the third j
loss by Stanford in 11 years of year- :
ling track competition with the
Bear Cubs.
Relay Was Test
Why more heartbreaking than the j
Big Meet? Because, after 14 of the j
15 events had been run off Stan- \
ford's battling squad of frosh had a ;
well earned one-point lead and were j
favored heavily to take the final |
event of the day, the relay.
But California's much-talked-of
"come through" athletes upset the
dope and carried away the relay by
h slight margin to add the needed
five points to their score. Final
count, California 67 1-G, Stanford
G3 5-G.
Shot-put Record
The Bears' big shot putter, Jim
Kitts, was the only record breaker
of the day. Kitts heaved the 16-
pound pellet 48 feet 7% inches to
win the event for the Cubs and
smash the Little Big Meet record.
Stanford's Captain Edson Burrows
was the most outstanding performer
lor the Cards. Burrows easily loped
to victory in the mile, bringing John
Dern in behind him for a good sec
ond. Later in the afternoon the Card
captain garnered second in the 880-
yard run, after he had been success
fully boxed by California through
most of the race.
Peters Wins Hurdles
Ken Peters proved his ability to
come through in competition by win
ning the high hurdles, and Jimmy
Kneubuhl gave sterling perform
ances in the century and relay.
Favored to take the 220, Kneubuhl
tied up after the first 100 yards,
and fought through for a second
place, Cy Oberg was a consistent
point winner with seconds in both
high and low hurdles.
Wallace Hardin, Hank Luisetti
and Stan Marks tallied victories in
the javelin, high jump and discus,
respectively, to build up the ma
jority of Stanford's field points.
