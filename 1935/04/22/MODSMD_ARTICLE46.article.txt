tary Academy's riders Friday 10 to 0, !
I a determined Stanford polo quartet j
! will make its bid for Western Inter- |
| collegiate polo supremacy this after-
I noon when it meets University of .
Arizona outfit.
Today's contest will get under way ;
at 3 o'clock on the Highway Field.
Class of the West
Arizona and Stanford have for i
I years been the class of collegiate polo
| in the West, and although there is ;
! no organized league or conference, j
| the winner of the annual series be- |
! tween the two schools is customarily |
! invited to represent the West in the ;
j Intercollegiate championships at j
! Chicago. Last year the Cards, by i
| virtue of winning two games out of j
i three from the Wildcats, were ten- I
I dered this offer to compete at Chi- :
| cago but lack of finances made
' Indian participation impossible.
J The Card riders are on the spot
j for this series because of two de- :
| feats they suffered last Thanksgiving ;
;at the hands of the Arizonans at i
' Tucson. It will be necessary for j
i Stanford to sweep the three games
here in order to win the total series.
Rasmusscn Out
The Thanksgiving games, however,
were the first on the Indian schedule
j and were played on strange ponies
|at Tucson. With considerable com
i petition behind them since then, the
I redshirts stand an excellent chance
' of turning the tables on the Wild- 1
' cats.
The Indian varsity has been weak
ened with news that the regular No.
' 3, Russ Rasmussen, who is reported
Sto be in the hospital, will be a
doubtful starter. Rasmussen was an
j important man in the Card offense
and should he fail to compete, Stan
j ford's chances of victory will be
dealth a severe blow. Lieut. H. Y.
j Grubbs' starting line-up, if Rasmus-
I sen is out, will probably find Bill
> Enemark at No. 1, Captain Bill Rog
ers at No. 2, Carl Beal, regular No. 1,
I at No. 3, and Bob Fullerton at No. 4.

I a determined Stanford polo quartet j
! will make its bid for Western Inter- |
| collegiate polo supremacy this after-
I noon when it meets University of .
Arizona outfit.
Today's contest will get under way ;
at 3 o'clock on the Highway Field.
Class of the West
Arizona and Stanford have for i
I years been the class of collegiate polo
| in the West, and although there is ;
! no organized league or conference, j
| the winner of the annual series be- |
! tween the two schools is customarily |
! invited to represent the West in the ;
j Intercollegiate championships at j
! Chicago. Last year the Cards, by i
| virtue of winning two games out of j
i three from the Wildcats, were ten- I
I dered this offer to compete at Chi- :
| cago but lack of finances made
' Indian participation impossible.
J The Card riders are on the spot
j for this series because of two de- :
| feats they suffered last Thanksgiving ;
;at the hands of the Arizonans at i
' Tucson. It will be necessary for j
i Stanford to sweep the three games
here in order to win the total series.
Rasmusscn Out
The Thanksgiving games, however,
were the first on the Indian schedule
j and were played on strange ponies
|at Tucson. With considerable com
i petition behind them since then, the
I redshirts stand an excellent chance
' of turning the tables on the Wild- 1
' cats.
The Indian varsity has been weak
ened with news that the regular No.
' 3, Russ Rasmussen, who is reported
Sto be in the hospital, will be a
doubtful starter. Rasmussen was an
j important man in the Card offense
and should he fail to compete, Stan
j ford's chances of victory will be
dealth a severe blow. Lieut. H. Y.
j Grubbs' starting line-up, if Rasmus-
I sen is out, will probably find Bill
> Enemark at No. 1, Captain Bill Rog
ers at No. 2, Carl Beal, regular No. 1,
I at No. 3, and Bob Fullerton at No. 4.
