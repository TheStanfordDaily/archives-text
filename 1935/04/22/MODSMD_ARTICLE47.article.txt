### 
Staging a remarkable comeback '
at the turning point of the entire i
series of matches, Captain Bob Un
derwood and Bob Braly led the '
Card frosh tennis team to a 6-3 vie- ;
tory over the California yearlings at 1
Berkeley Saturday. This was Stan- '
ford's first frosh net win over the
Bears since 1929.
Coach Sherman Lockwood's Pap- t
ooses were leading, three matches to i
two, when Underwood and Braly
took the court for the first doubles
against Captain Tate Coulthard and
Dick Hyde of the Bear Cubs. Stan
ford gained an early 3-1 lead in the
first set, but the Californians won
the next four games to take a 5-3
lead.
The score then seesawed for 19
moie games until the Cubs took the
lead and had a point-set advantage
at 13-14 and love-40, wilh Braly
serving. He and Underwood then
took five straight points and the next
two games to end the gruelling set,
16-15.
With far less trouble, Ihe Card
frosh won the second set, 6-4. At
the same time, Bob Colwell, playing j
fifth singles, also came from behind
to defeat the Beans' Muir Wooley,
