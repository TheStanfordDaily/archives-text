BEAR HAD INDIAN

77V2 to 53V;> was a sweet victory

I and decisively; they came through.
I Praises be that relay win didn't go

The old Indian of Stanford track
1 had a tough afternoon. He was a
J bit slothful, perhaps, from hawing
j his own way for too many years.
I He had hardly sat down Saturday,
i however, before he realized that
' something was wrong. This was
i n't going to he an ordinary Stan
| ford-California meet.
Just before the start of the mile
| the first shout went up from the
| eager California rooters. Big Dave
i Meek dropped the shot out on the
! 50-foot line. It was a foul throw,
but it signified what was to follow.
| The mile was tough, but the Indian
! wasn't upset yet. Coach Brutus
j Hamilton finally talked the injured
Mushy Pollock off the track, so the
100-yard dash went as prescribed.
| The Indian almost had his self-com
-1 posure again, after Sam Klopstock
j won the highs going away in the
i prettiest race of the day.

last throw, the best of his career,
and a foot in the first place. It
