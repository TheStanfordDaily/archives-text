# CUB NINE BEATS CARD YEARLINGS
## 
### 
Scoring heavily in two big inn- j
ings, the California freshman base- j
ball nine defeated the Card yearling !
team 6-3 Saturday morning on the
Bear diamond. By winning this game
the Californians took the 1935 "little :
series" two games to one.
Spike Furman, starting Indian
hurler, pitched good ball up until
the fourth inning, when he developed j
a streak of wildness, and the Bears !
combined two hits with two walks
to gain three runs. Don McMillan j
replaced Furman in the fifth inning, j
but he was ineffective and was re
lieved by Glenn Hamilton after two
runs had been scored. Hamilton re
tired the side with one more run
being scored and pitched a steady
game for the remaining innings.
Coach Ernie Nevers' men played
good ball in their last game of the
season and made only one error.
The Indians were not able to solve
the pitching of Weiner, however, and
their batting was weak.
