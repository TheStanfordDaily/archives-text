# ELEVENTH INNING SCORE GIVES BEAR NINE 4-3 VICTORY
## 
### 
Lady luck once again turned her
back on the Indian ball team and
California's Bears grabbed oft an
11-inning game at Edwards Field
Saturday. The score was 4-3.
California's heroes seemed to fa
vor the letter "F" for the day. In
track it was Fitzgerald, and in base
ball it was a fellow by the name of
Fite that slole the show.
Fite Stars for Cal
In the ninth with the Cardinals
leading 3-2 Fite slammed out a
triple to score Crawford with the
tieing run. Not satisfied, he came up
in the eleventh and drove out a
double N scoring Williams with the
winning run.
Previous to this he had spoiled
a swell Indian rally in the seventh
with a one-hand running catch that
robbed Bones Hamilton of a home
run. Had Fite failed to handle the
ball it would have meant two runs
and the ball game.
Heringer pitched the whole game
for the Cards, allowing hits and
striking out eight Bears. Gallison,
who started on the mound for Cal,
again proved to be a "cousin" to the
Redskin batters and they chased him
game in the seventh.
Contribute Errors
Frank Tremaine, Gordy Mallatratt,
and Ted Leidig contributed errors,
but Howell Turner and Ed Clark
played smooth ball at second and
short. The first three mentioned
along with Clark and Mike Ferro
constituted the Indian batting at
tack, each getting one safe blow.
Saturday's win gave the Golden
Bears the series two games out of
three. The first contest went to
them 5-3, while the Cards came
back to win the second game 8-6.

Lady luck once again turned her
back on the Indian ball team and
California's Bears grabbed oft an
11-inning game at Edwards Field
Saturday. The score was 4-3.
California's heroes seemed to fa
vor the letter "F" for the day. In
track it was Fitzgerald, and in base
ball it was a fellow by the name of
Fite that slole the show.
Fite Stars for Cal
In the ninth with the Cardinals
leading 3-2 Fite slammed out a
triple to score Crawford with the
tieing run. Not satisfied, he came up
in the eleventh and drove out a
double N scoring Williams with the
winning run.
Previous to this he had spoiled
a swell Indian rally in the seventh
with a one-hand running catch that
robbed Bones Hamilton of a home
run. Had Fite failed to handle the
ball it would have meant two runs
and the ball game.
Heringer pitched the whole game
for the Cards, allowing hits and
striking out eight Bears. Gallison,
who started on the mound for Cal,
again proved to be a "cousin" to the
Redskin batters and they chased him
game in the seventh.
Contribute Errors
Frank Tremaine, Gordy Mallatratt,
and Ted Leidig contributed errors,
but Howell Turner and Ed Clark
played smooth ball at second and
short. The first three mentioned
along with Clark and Mike Ferro
constituted the Indian batting at
tack, each getting one safe blow.
Saturday's win gave the Golden
Bears the series two games out of
three. The first contest went to
them 5-3, while the Cards came
back to win the second game 8-6.
