# PIT BEING BUILT FOR BARBECUE
## Plan Permanent Structure, Concrete-Lined 
### 
As a permanent feature of this
year's arrangements for the Labor
Day activities at the Convalescent
Home, May 1, a concrete barbecue
pit is being constructed.
The pit has been badly needed in
the past, for the old dirt pits which
were dug each year proved to be a
great deal of trouble. Now, how
ever, work will be much easier for
chief barbecue tender Sam McDon
ald and his aides in preparing vast
amounts of lamb for the workers.
Chairman Mel Luhmann, head of
Labor Day activities, has been in
strumental in procuring this addi
tionHo the equipment for Labor Day
at the Convalescent Home. With the
help of Ben Facciolla and A. Rie
chers of the Corporation Yard, the
pit has been constructed at a very
reasonable cost.
The pit is all cement lined, 20 feet
long, 7 feet wide and 3 feet deep.
This will give ample room for Labor
Day barbecues in the future.
The actual barbecue arrangements
are being handled by co-Chairmen
Kermit Jeffrey and Jack Horton.
Under their direction the lamb will
be barbecued; sandwiches will be
supplied by the sororities, and ice
cream and coffee will be provided to
feed hungry workers.
Bob Hoover, Bud Desenberg,
John Atkinson, Merrel Darr, Mike
Arkoosh, and Jay Mott have been
helping with the construction of the
pit.
