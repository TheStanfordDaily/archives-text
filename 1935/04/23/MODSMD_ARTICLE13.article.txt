# EX COMMITTEE TO HEAR STARK
## Yell Leader Probe Set For Tonight's Meeting 
### 
An investigation into the reason
why there was no yell leader at last
Saturday's Big Meet will be con
ducted tonight, when Ex Committee
plays host to Dick Stark, head yell
leader, according to A.S.S.U. Presi- (
dent Marvie Kahn.
Stark's answer to the widespread
campus evoked by the lack of lead
ership for the rooting section is ex
pected at (his time.
Tonight's meeting will not lack
for incidental fireworks. Dividex
covers and the Concert Series, two
provoking problems, will both be
subject to the oratorical bufferings
in the Old Union council chamber.
Stirs Up Trouble
Dividex advertising covers, inno
cent things on the surface, have
stirred up a hornet's nest between
ihe Publications Council, the Grad
uate Manager's Office, and Ex Com
mittee.
In the past it has been the custom
for Ex Committee to give the ex
clusive right to solicit the advertis
ing, print the dividex sheets, and
distribute them free of charge to be
used by prospective consumers in
their loose-leaf binders, to some en
terprising applicant from the stu
dent body. Last year, the enter
prising applicant grossed about
$1000 it) this manner.
This year the Publications Coun
cil has requested Ex Committee that
this legitimate means of revenue be
turned over to them, with the profit
to be split between the council, the
solicitor-general, and the A.S.S.U.
Master's l'lan
Graduate Manager A1 Masters has
I suggested that, instead, dividexing
| be started as a regular student activ
ity under the supervision of Ex
i Committee, with a regular salary go
j ing to the manager of the activity
and the rest reverting to the A.S.S.U.
Ex Committee last Tuesday indi
cated that it didn't know what it
wants, and is waiting fo? the sub
mission of more concrete proposals
by Masters and the Publications
j Council tonight.
