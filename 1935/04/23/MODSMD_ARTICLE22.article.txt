# Japan Dominates Cotton Industry of North China
## 
### 
TIENTSIN, China, April 22 </P).â€”
Japanese commercial expansion in
North China reached today the point
of almost complete domination of the
cotton industry, most important en
terprise in the area, with only one
mill remaining wholly under Chi
nese ownership.
Threats of actual military penetra
tion of this region, formerly the scat
of the Chinese dynasty, have long
since died down, but observers point
out that the Japanese conquest of
the vast territory north of the Yellow
River continues with Japanese cap
italists, diplomats and businessmen
taking up where the soldiers left oil.
