## 
### 
HONG KONG. April 22 </P>. -
Hong Kong, formerly one of the
most remote points from world capi
tals, rejoiced today that it would
soon receive mail from London
| within nine days.
Ordinarily mail still will require
j2O days from New York and 30
from London. However, London
letters to be brought by the new
French airmail service will take
â™¦wo weeks. This time probably will
; be reduced to nine days, according
i to an arrangement by which Chinese
[airplanes will fly mail fiom Canton
I to the French Tonking border.
