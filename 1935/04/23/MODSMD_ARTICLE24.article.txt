# Huey Threatens State Secession In Fiery Tirade
## Delights Large Audience In Demand for Louisiana Tax Freedom Kingfish Replies to Recent Ickes Attack 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 22 (JP). — j
Senator Long of Louisiana today J •
dug a bristling array of adjcctives
from the depths of an explosive j
vocabulary, hurled them broadside j
at his administration critics and i
added a threat that Louisiana will !
secede from the taxpaying union — |
"if they don't watch out."
Casting aside such restraints as
h;ive characterized his recent speech
es, he laid- down the principle, with
appropriate rhetorical embellish
ments, that state authorities, not
Washington officials, must have the
final say on expenditures increasing
(he debt of Louisiana's municipali- j
tics.
He delighted a huge throng of J
I Easter visitors, who crammed every j
j inch of spectator room, with a re-
I turn to his characteristically em- 1
I phatic manner of oratory—eyes and
j head rolling, twisty forelock askew,
! arms larruping the surrounding at
! mosphere.
Secretary Ickes, who last week |
referred to him as one afflicted with I
"halitosis of the intellect," was lam
basted by Long today as "the chinch
bug from Chicago" and the "lord
high chamberlain" of the Admin
istration.
Others of his cabinet peeves were J
| not neglected. He attributed "royal !
prerogatives to 'prime minister' j
i James Aloysius Farley—emphasis
i upon the middle name—and 'Henry
I Almighty Wallace,' whom he called
! the ignoramus from lowa."
Later he lumped all Administra- '
j tion heads together in an assertion |
I that "if there is proof of honesty"
i among administrative boards they
are "dismissed."
Meanwhile, the political pan sput
tered over other fires. At Atlanta,
Governor Eugene Talmadge bluntly
asserted it would be a "national ca
lamity" if President Roosevelt were
to be renominated by the Democratic
party next year.
