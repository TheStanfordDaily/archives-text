TAIHOKU, Formosa, April 23
(Tuesday)—A Japanese destroyer
laden with doctors and supplies wa.j
speeding from Mako naval base to
day to quake-stricken Formosa,
where 250,000 homeless survivors ol
Sunday's disaster were plagued with
parching thirst through destruction
of water sources.
Casualties Grow
The death toll grew meanwhile to
3040 (announced officially in Tokyo
by the Rengo News Agency) as cas
ualties among injured and belated
reports from inaccessible districts
swelled the total.
Scarcity of food and water as
sumed grave proportions. Virtually
| all pipelines and water reservoirs
j had been wrecked by shocks which
laid v/aste to 2000 square miles.
Heat Adds Misery
Insanity among bereaved parents,
j children and injured began to be
! noticed frequently by relief workers.
| A scorching tropical sun beat down
pitilessly on the misery-torn sur
| vivors, inflicting new suffering.
| Thousands stumbled with parched
j and swoolen tongues among the
| ruins, seeking water.
The Japanese government sent 50
j relief parties with doctors, water
j and food to stricken districts.
U.S. Offers Aid
Offers of relief from many foreign
sources poured in. Admiral B. F.
Upham, commander in chief of the
i United States Asiatic Fleet, of
fered to send an American warship
from Shanghai, but the Japanese

a former capital, where most of the
American and European residents
live, were not seriously damaged.
From an airplane the ravages of
fire could be seen in many tumbled
villages, where oil lamps and primi
tive lighting devices had been upset
by the shocks, causing flames to
spread.
I Early estimates of property dam
age ranged from $3,000,000 to twic
i that amount. The humble charac
j ter of most destroyed buildings,
