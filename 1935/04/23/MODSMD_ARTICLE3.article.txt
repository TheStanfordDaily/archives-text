# B.A.C. To Refund Money Collected For Benefit Meet
## 
### 
1.C.4-A. Benefit Meet tickets
will be refunded during the
remainder of this week at the
B.A.C. ticket booth, it was an-p
nounced last night by A1 Mas
ters, graduate manager.
It was with some reluctance
that Skull and Snakes, sponsors
of the proposed meet, decided
to postpone the affair indefi
nitely, but since no suitable fu
ture date was in the offing it
remained as the only alterna
tive.
Sad indeed is the meet's
short, ill-fated histoiy. Orig
inally scheduled for March 9,
the benefit was rained out and
April 6 set for the new date
with hopes for better weather
conditions.
On this latter day the heav
ens unleashed their fur again
and Angell Field bore more re
semblance to the Enema Pools
than a track stadium. For sev
eral days the committee arbi
trated on the possibility of re
scheduling the affair but finally
dropped the matter entirely.
