# The
						Crime of Being a College Professor
## 
### 
More and more does Sacramento become the
|{cd-l>aiters' paradise and the college profes
sors' antipathy.
Latest word from the state's capital is the
condemnation of Professor (irahaui Stuart ot
Ihe political science department who had the
effrontery to tel I Sacra men la ns that the t ni ted
States should have joined Ihe World Court,
and the fuiiher denunciation of the eighteen
I Diversity of California professors who ex
pressed opposition to the proposed anti-corn*
niunist hills.
Assemblymen, seeing a holshevisl behind
every tree on the campuses of the state, be
come hysterical in their madness.
The outburst against Professor Stuart
comes from Editor C. K. McClatchy, to whom
"it is inconceivable . . . why our universities
permit and encourage their 'hired help' thus
to disseminate European and practically un-
American ideas among their students and
among Ihe people generally." The Sacramento
editor would have "some stalwart citizen," like
Hiram Johnson, dispel these un-American
ideas from the minds of the college youth.
In condemning Professor Stuart, McClatchy
was also belittling those Presidents of the
tinted States in the last thirty-odd years who
have advocated what the Stanford savant did
adherence of Ibis country to the World
Court. McClatchy and the super-patriots of
Sacramento, however, fell that they, after a
lew hours of research, were belter informed
than the college professors who had spent the
greater part of their lives studying the exact
details of their various subjects or the Presi
dents who were versed in the affairs of Ihe
world.
When will the jingoists of Sacramento cease
their rabid and farcical mutlerings?
