# A 						Liberal Trend Toward Filth
## 
### 
A general cultural trend hits been develop
ing in this country for Ihe past two years,
which is sadly regrettable lo the minority of
citizenry, and highly landed by a majority of
the so-called common people of our great
democracy.
The balmiest days of the gay nineties, the
ribald witticisms and corner saloon ditties, the
burlesque queens and their daring attire, seem
merely to have come into another cycle of
popularity. But this time there is nothing
ball-svav about the process. America is rap
idly becoming more and more filthy minded.
Some people blame ii on the depression.
()tbers say thai at last an advanced people are
gelling rid of their silence upon the subject of
sc\, another clique of psychologists maintains
I hat inhibitions are being cast aside under the.
nervous strain of present-dav living condi
tions.
It might be a lot more simple, and jnsl as
truthful, to conclude that the great American
public is light now engulfed in a morass of
scv dramas, foul songs, beer-tavern verses,
and a period of lillh that has no precedent,
even in Burbary Coast days.
In New York, Chicago, all the major cities
id Ihe country, the sophisticated songster
sealed at the piano in some smart cafe fre
quented hv the "best" circles, has come into
prominence. In a polished, insinuating bar
room manner he sings verse after verse of
pure rot while the old hellers forget their sag
ging chins and their protruding waistlines
while I hey roar out approval.
The movies attempted some Ivpe of censor
ship. Thev succeeded in producing a few mas
terpieces such as "David Copperficld," "The
House of Hothschild," and "Vanessa" all his
torical dramas, or adapted from famous nov
els. But then the censors became near-sighted,
or couldn't understand the jokes, or some
thing equally unexplainable. for coming out
simultaneously with these masterpieces has
been a series of cinemas that would embarrass
any of Ihe old school of philanderers, each
stamped with its "approved" sign by the pro
ducers' code of the industry.
In New York a nudist play makes its ap
pearance - a sort of half-way nudist play,
since the butler is in shorts, and the hero is
clad in underwear only, while Ihe heroine
makes a dramatic appearance in rolled stock
ings and a hair net, or apparel to that effect.
I In re is only one conclusion to be drawn
from the facts. Wcstbrook Pegler, newspaper
columnist, has made it. He minces no words,
ind what he says has the ring ol something
•at many term "old-fashioned truth."
There is an old superstition thai great na
s before they tall get rotten in their inor
"ut in the enjoyment ol a freedom newly
see and hear corruption in the theater
e restaurant only a soup-puss would
• thtil lo view with alarm. Take the

adolescents to see the naked women and hear
the loiil-inouthed pianist sing his songs. This
is liberality at Inst."
