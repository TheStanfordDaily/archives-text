## MACHINES vs. PRICE SYSTEM: BECKER 
### CEDRIC LARSON 
With western civilization in the grip of an economic
creeping paralysis, and nearly six lull years of depres
sion rounded out iri America, a symptom of the age
is a critical re-examination of social institutions all
along the line. '
Professor Cart L. Becker, visiting lecturer from
Cornell University, who is delivering the West Me
morial addresses, believes that one of ihe most im
portant if not crucial problems with which America
has to grapple is the relation between machines, dis
tribution, and the price-system.
For the past hundred and fifty years, the pro
lessor states, tlie best brains and skill of ni*w have
been applied to manufacturing goods and perfect
ing technical devices, but comparatively little
attention has been paid to distribution, which has
been left to the uncertain operation of individual
self-interest, or more often to chance.
During the era of manpower, anybody engaged in
business could go on the assumption that he could
produce as much as he wished without glutting the
market, but when machinery was introduced this all
was changed. Production soon exceeded demand, dnd
demand had to be created; then advertising was born.
Industrialism in its first phase produced capitalism
based upon the price-system. Industrialism's next log
ical development in the struggle for markets was the
imperialistic scramble after colonies, spheres of influ
ence and economic penertation of backward areas of
the world's surface.
We have.at last reached 'v point, however, where
all existing markets have been absorbed and the
home markets have had to be re-exploited. Mean
while the economic system becomes more complex,
and industries that make machines to make ma
chines even arise. The machine-world becomes
more and more automatic, requiring constantly
less manpower. A vicious cycle of technological
unemployment is set up, with those out of work in
America reaching 20 to :>;» per cent of the popu
lation.
There are two principal ways out of ibis dilemma,
states Professor Becker: (1) Reducing tlie hours of
employment sufficiently so that all can be employed
at a living wage, or (2) abandon the price system and
adopt a regulated form of social distribution adapting
the better points both of the pricc and collectivist
systems.
America now plows under cotton and restricts
wheat crops while millions are ill-clad and hun
gry: this is logical front the angle of the price
system. "From the standpoint of social welfare,
however, it is not only ironical but ridiculous to
have a plethora of goods and food when alongside
large numbers of people stand in breadlines,"
states Professor Becker. "Many people look at the
problems created by an extremely mechanized con
dition in mental terms of a past generation."
The "harsh pressure of economic distress" will in
exorably modify our institutions to meet the new situ
ations if a planned economy cannot cope with the
situation, the professor concludes.

There are two principal ways out of ibis dilemma,
states Professor Becker: (1) Reducing tlie hours of
employment sufficiently so that all can be employed
at a living wage, or (2) abandon the price system and
adopt a regulated form of social distribution adapting
the better points both of the pricc and collectivist
systems.
America now plows under cotton and restricts
wheat crops while millions are ill-clad and hun
gry: this is logical front the angle of the price
system. "From the standpoint of social welfare,
however, it is not only ironical but ridiculous to
have a plethora of goods and food when alongside
large numbers of people stand in breadlines,"
states Professor Becker. "Many people look at the
problems created by an extremely mechanized con
dition in mental terms of a past generation."
The "harsh pressure of economic distress" will in
exorably modify our institutions to meet the new situ
ations if a planned economy cannot cope with the
situation, the professor concludes.
With western civilization in the grip of an economic
creeping paralysis, and nearly six lull years of depres
sion rounded out iri America, a symptom of the age
is a critical re-examination of social institutions all
along the line. '
Professor Cart L. Becker, visiting lecturer from
Cornell University, who is delivering the West Me
morial addresses, believes that one of ihe most im
portant if not crucial problems with which America
has to grapple is the relation between machines, dis
tribution, and the price-system.
For the past hundred and fifty years, the pro
lessor states, tlie best brains and skill of ni*w have
been applied to manufacturing goods and perfect
ing technical devices, but comparatively little
attention has been paid to distribution, which has
been left to the uncertain operation of individual
self-interest, or more often to chance.
During the era of manpower, anybody engaged in
business could go on the assumption that he could
produce as much as he wished without glutting the
market, but when machinery was introduced this all
was changed. Production soon exceeded demand, dnd
demand had to be created; then advertising was born.
Industrialism in its first phase produced capitalism
based upon the price-system. Industrialism's next log
ical development in the struggle for markets was the
imperialistic scramble after colonies, spheres of influ
ence and economic penertation of backward areas of
the world's surface.
We have.at last reached 'v point, however, where
all existing markets have been absorbed and the
home markets have had to be re-exploited. Mean
while the economic system becomes more complex,
and industries that make machines to make ma
chines even arise. The machine-world becomes
more and more automatic, requiring constantly
less manpower. A vicious cycle of technological
unemployment is set up, with those out of work in
America reaching 20 to :>;» per cent of the popu
lation.
