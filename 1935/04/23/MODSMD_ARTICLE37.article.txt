WHY NOT BE MARRIED
What do'those persons who have sought and "found
1 the ways of love" do after graduation? Economic
| depression is not over. Jobs paying enough to support
I more than one person remain illusive. Yet it is hardly
to be expected that young devoted couples will remain
! in abeyance because there is no bank account. Sum
| mer will find thousands, their diplomas pocketed, in a
I dilemma.
Harper's magazine, in considering this problem,
presents views, which are presented in this article,
in a manner that lias been enlightening to many
undergraduates in scores of colleges.
Every student either knows or has heard of the
; tragedy of our social system which prevents those of
! pre-alter age from enjoying normal, healthy lives.
All colleges have their hundreds who are concerned
with finding a permanent, happy way of life that will
j fit into the new boundaries imposed by the economic
and social situation. And those who know or have
â–  heard know of the unhappiness that so often results.
Dora Russell's "The Right to Be Happy" and other
! similar books on morals hit with explosive force on
American campi some years ago. An informed writer
I tells of a secret census taken in several large women's
i colleges to determine the status of that peculiar qual
' ily known as virginity. The results actually showed
that the majority were known as maidens by courtesy
! only.
But that wcs some years ago. The cults of free
love and companionate marriage are no longer in
favor. Economic stress and a universally growing
desire for companionship in facing difficult situa
tions have shaken sense into undergraduate couples.
They realize there are three courses open to them,
",n(I if they are wise they choose the one which is
at the same time the most difficult and the most
sane.
i The first course involves denying desire for the
time being and endure a long engagement period.
This is unnatural. Doctors have pointed out that
i complete abstinence over a long period between two
| persons in love is both soul-rending and destructive.
The second course provides for acceptance of de
j sire and living together without marriage. This is
harder for a woman than for a man. If it is not ac
i tually immoral, it almost invariably incurs parential
I wrath. If the affair is kept secret, guilt is likely to
color the relationship. A young woman in love does
j not enjoy intrigue for intrigue's sake; anything that
I is clandestine or two-faced is distasteful. Those who
believe a pre-marital affair can be the same as
marriage are deluded.
The third course which young couples may
take is marriage, usually with poverty or an un
finished education facing them. If this course is
taken, pride must be swallowed, and the nonsense
about the necessity of an expensive church wed
ding and a prolonged honeymoon must lie recog
nized as nonsense. Accepting -\id from parents
is no longer to be frowned on, anymore than it
was in the 18th century when it was quite custo
mary for a young husband to settle in the bride's
home for a while.
The idea that newlyweds must begin life in a
specified manner, on a certain scale, and with abso
j lute financial security puts most couples in their dilem-
I ma. That idea also keeps many from marriage and
i loosens morals. A good percentage of young Ameri
j cans live together before marriage, soberly, with open
I eyes, and in all solemnity. And they often make fhem-
I selves unhappy.
