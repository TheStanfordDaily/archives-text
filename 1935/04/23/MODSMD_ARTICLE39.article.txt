# TRAVELS OF A STANFORD ROUGH
## 
### GRANT LEIBERT 
The University of Arizona is sur
prisingly cosmopolitan; of some 50
acquaintances I made there, not 10
were natives of the state. No secret
is made of the fact that working
hours are few and playtime is any
time. I commented on the mueh ap
parent informality to one girl, from
Chicago, who replied:
"Informal is hardly the word for
it; after a few months in this place
you go native and don't give a damn
'or anything but a good stiff drink.
Your skin dries up, your hair fades,
you become careless about your ap
pearance, manners, dress—but you
always come back. Every summer I
*o home swearing I'll never set foot
n Arizona again, and here I am, a
ienior."
"So what?" I asked.
"So what?" she echoed.
Vogales, Ariz.
Everyone you meet in this pleas
ant little community confidentially
ells you that Nogales has the best
climate, real estate, business oppor
tunities, and' ruins in Arizona, in
act, in the whole Southwest; but,
unlike other towns, Nogales does
riot care to advertise its munificence.
The Chamber of Commerce even
puts out pamphlets declaring the re
luctance of Nogales to speak of her
many incomparable opportunities
and natural advantages. Seriously
speaking, there is much appreciation
due this town for her successful ef
orts in stimulating commerce with
Mexico, which today amounts to ap
proximately $50,000,000 per year, 60
per cent imports and 40 per cent
exports.
I went for a stroll around the
town. A little while later 1 stopped
and wondered why I was seeing so
many dark brown faces. I was in
Mexico! I bad crossed the border
to Nogales, Mexico, the twin sis
ter of the American town. Like
most border towns, Nogales is
comprised chiefly of saloons and
cabarets, whose existence may be
ultimately dealt a depth blow by
the repeal of prohibition. Nogales
could experience nothing more
eventful, because, rich in miner
als. grazing lands, and fertile soil,
she can hardly hope to realize the

future which lies ahead of her by
virtue of bar room and curio shop.
With head bowed to the dust laden
winds which swept down each nar
row street, I attempted to give the
town the once-over as I passed the
four hours until my train left for
the south. A small army of boot
blacks, curio vendors,- beggars, taxi
drivers .and guides followed in my
wake offering me everything from a
one-cent shine to an option on the
Federal Palace. My Spanish was
so bad that they couldn't even un
derstand a negative shake of my
head. 1 decided to get a Mexican
newspaper and improve it at once;
so, cornering a newsboy, I beat his
price down from 25 to 5 centavos.
He grinned broadly as I handed him
the money, and I thought what a po
lite little chap he was, and how
| heartless of me to drive such a hard
i bargain with him. Seeking shelter
I in a nearby tavern, I sat down and
| spread the paper out before me. It
! was nine days old.
When the list goat hail been
: boosted up the steps and tied in a
' corner of the second class tar, and
when the conductors and the en
| gineer and the firemen simulta
neously had an inclination to pro
! ceed, the train pulled out of No
gales. I settled back in my seat to
dream of romance, glamour and
beauty which I was positive were
ahead of me. HermosiUo, where
the most beautiful women in all
Mexico are—that would be my first
■ stop.
HermosiUo, Mexico.
In somewhat of a daze I stepped
j off the train into a throng of noisy,
[soliciting Mexicans that would make
I a New York subway at 6 o'clock
i seem as barren as Death Valley.
II was so confused and eager to get
out of the crowd that I even for got
I to quibble with the cab driver, Who
i took me to a hotel. When I asked
1 him who the potentate was that the
[,lown had turned out to welcome, he
j smiled at my ignorance and said it
was only the train, which those who
had nothing else to do always met.

act, in the whole Southwest; but,
unlike other towns, Nogales does
riot care to advertise its munificence.
The Chamber of Commerce even
puts out pamphlets declaring the re
luctance of Nogales to speak of her
many incomparable opportunities
and natural advantages. Seriously
speaking, there is much appreciation
due this town for her successful ef
orts in stimulating commerce with
Mexico, which today amounts to ap
proximately $50,000,000 per year, 60
per cent imports and 40 per cent
exports.
I went for a stroll around the
town. A little while later 1 stopped
and wondered why I was seeing so
many dark brown faces. I was in
Mexico! I bad crossed the border
to Nogales, Mexico, the twin sis
ter of the American town. Like
most border towns, Nogales is
comprised chiefly of saloons and
cabarets, whose existence may be
ultimately dealt a depth blow by
the repeal of prohibition. Nogales
could experience nothing more
eventful, because, rich in miner
als. grazing lands, and fertile soil,
she can hardly hope to realize the

future which lies ahead of her by
virtue of bar room and curio shop.
With head bowed to the dust laden
winds which swept down each nar
row street, I attempted to give the
town the once-over as I passed the
four hours until my train left for
the south. A small army of boot
blacks, curio vendors,- beggars, taxi
drivers .and guides followed in my
wake offering me everything from a
one-cent shine to an option on the
Federal Palace. My Spanish was
so bad that they couldn't even un
derstand a negative shake of my
head. 1 decided to get a Mexican
newspaper and improve it at once;
so, cornering a newsboy, I beat his
price down from 25 to 5 centavos.
He grinned broadly as I handed him
the money, and I thought what a po
lite little chap he was, and how
| heartless of me to drive such a hard
i bargain with him. Seeking shelter
I in a nearby tavern, I sat down and
| spread the paper out before me. It
! was nine days old.
When the list goat hail been
: boosted up the steps and tied in a
' corner of the second class tar, and
when the conductors and the en
| gineer and the firemen simulta
neously had an inclination to pro
! ceed, the train pulled out of No
gales. I settled back in my seat to
dream of romance, glamour and
beauty which I was positive were
ahead of me. HermosiUo, where
the most beautiful women in all
Mexico are—that would be my first
■ stop.
HermosiUo, Mexico.
In somewhat of a daze I stepped
j off the train into a throng of noisy,
[soliciting Mexicans that would make
I a New York subway at 6 o'clock
i seem as barren as Death Valley.
II was so confused and eager to get
out of the crowd that I even for got
I to quibble with the cab driver, Who
i took me to a hotel. When I asked
1 him who the potentate was that the
[,lown had turned out to welcome, he
j smiled at my ignorance and said it
was only the train, which those who
had nothing else to do always met.

The University of Arizona is sur
prisingly cosmopolitan; of some 50

hours are few and playtime is any

parent informality to one girl, from
Chicago, who replied:
"Informal is hardly the word for
it; after a few months in this place
you go native and don't give a damn
'or anything but a good stiff drink.

als. grazing lands, and fertile soil,
she can hardly hope to realize the

future which lies ahead of her by
virtue of bar room and curio shop.
With head bowed to the dust laden
winds which swept down each nar
row street, I attempted to give the
town the once-over as I passed the
four hours until my train left for
the south. A small army of boot
blacks, curio vendors,- beggars, taxi
drivers .and guides followed in my
wake offering me everything from a
one-cent shine to an option on the
Federal Palace. My Spanish was
so bad that they couldn't even un
derstand a negative shake of my
head. 1 decided to get a Mexican
newspaper and improve it at once;
so, cornering a newsboy, I beat his
price down from 25 to 5 centavos.
He grinned broadly as I handed him
the money, and I thought what a po
lite little chap he was, and how
| heartless of me to drive such a hard
i bargain with him. Seeking shelter
I in a nearby tavern, I sat down and
| spread the paper out before me. It
! was nine days old.
When the list goat hail been
: boosted up the steps and tied in a
' corner of the second class tar, and
when the conductors and the en
| gineer and the firemen simulta
neously had an inclination to pro
! ceed, the train pulled out of No
gales. I settled back in my seat to
dream of romance, glamour and
beauty which I was positive were
ahead of me. HermosiUo, where
the most beautiful women in all
Mexico are—that would be my first
■ stop.
HermosiUo, Mexico.
In somewhat of a daze I stepped
j off the train into a throng of noisy,
[soliciting Mexicans that would make
I a New York subway at 6 o'clock
i seem as barren as Death Valley.
II was so confused and eager to get
out of the crowd that I even for got
I to quibble with the cab driver, Who
i took me to a hotel. When I asked
1 him who the potentate was that the
[,lown had turned out to welcome, he
j smiled at my ignorance and said it
was only the train, which those who
had nothing else to do always met.
Next—More about Mexico.
