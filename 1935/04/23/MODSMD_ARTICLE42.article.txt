THE STANFORD JINX
GOT GUS

Now thi.t the Big Meet is over, and
Captain A1 Blackmail lias partici- |
pated in at least one of the im
portant meets of the year without j
encountering the famed jinx which
has pursued and caught the last ;
half-dozen Stanford track captains,
the present troubles of Gus Meier,
last year's leader, can be printed j
without fear of calling up a bugaboo, j
Gus Meier was one of the "silk
purses" that Dink Templeton made •
out of a "sow's ear," as Gus's own
dad put it. When Meier first came
to Stanford all he had in an athletic
way was a pair of long legs, a love
for track, and a superabundance of
willingness. In his frosh year he
looked hopeless, but he stuck with
it. He hud polished hurdling form
by sheer hours of practice by the
end of his sophomore season. At the
close of his junior year he startled
everyone by coming out first in na- j
tional competition.
His team-mates elected him i
captain in recognition of his v.bll
ity and 111 admiration for the 1
qualities that permitted him to
come from a nobody to a champ
in three years. Last fall and spring,
a year ago, he was preparing for a
l/'tvt year of competition. It prom
ised to he a brilliant one, climaxed
by reappearance at the national
meets and 1 possible trip abroad
with an American track squad.

A FREAK ACCIDENT
WRECKED EVE R Y T HIN C i

THIS IS ALL BUNK
TO GUS

No one present at the Fresno State j
meet last year has forgotten the pall
that struck Angell Field when Meier
fell with all his brilliant hopes. He j
hit one of the first few barriers in
a low hurdle race, and a freak acci- j
dent caused a compound fracture of
his left arm. Gus had to be carried ;
from the track, and all the thrills of (
a really great meet went with him..
Walter Marty was jumping for a 1
world's record in the high jump, but ■
the injury of his friend left him un
nerved.
For a year now Meier lu?s been
fighting to recover from the brok
en arm .which carne as a reward
for three years of conscientious j
training. For months he was fl".t j
on his back, his arm raised to aid ,
in "the battle against the infection
that soon set in. It's been said ,
that the arm was thought lost more
than once. Then followed more
months in which the arm was
kept in a cast. A few weeks ago
i( seemed tlv<t the w>iy was finally i
clear for complete healing.

Gus went back to the hospital two |
weeks ago lor what was to bo the
last operation. But the infection
came back, and once again Gus is a
"patient." But he's more than the ,
ordinary patient at the Palo Alto ,
Hospital—he's "Gus" to everybody
from the staff doctors to the garden- t
ers, and ha gets a cheery "Good i
morning, Gus"' from them all.
Gus doesn't like sport stories; j
he thinks they're all bunk, and he j
probably has the right idea. r lhis |
must be so much sympathetic
sob-sister dribble to him, if he
ever reads it tomorrow morning
when they bring the Daily around i
to the men's ward in the hospital.
But there '-ire plenty of people that
are pulling for Gus Meier to get
well, and admire him as repre
senting the swellcst in Stanford
athletes. That's the only reason
for printing this story.
