# FARM POLO TEAM DOWNED BY FAST TUCSON FOUR, 13-3
## 
### 
i Hit by the last-minute unexpected
loss of two varsity stars, Stanford's
I poloists went down to defeat yester
day afternoon on the highway field
I before the attack of as sweet an out
, lit of polo players as has ever been
! seen in action here. When the dust
| of battle had settled, the scoreboard
read 13 fort the University of Ari
zona against 3 goals for the Red
-1 shirts.
Russ F.asmussen, regular No. 3,
was out of action as a result of be-,
ing struck on the knee in practice,
while No. 4 Bob Fullerton was in
1 the hospital with measles. The loss
lof these two regulars completely
: shot the offense and defense of Lieut.
| Grubbs' outfit.
Lack Teamwork
Lack of Indian teamwork and the
(excellent playing of the Wildcats
i contributed to the Stanford down
; fall, though the remaining varsity
; riders, Captain Bill Rogers and Carl
Beal, both turned in brilliant per
-1 formances. Rogers was all over the
i field and played a whale of a game.
1 Beal likewise was a tower of
| strength in the Card line-up and
i accounted for two beautiful scores.
Had the regular line-up been in, the
(game's result might have been very
; different.
Arizona's quartet amply justified
its reputation as the leading col
legiate aggregation in the West. De
spite the fact that the visitors were
I playing on strange mounts, their
teamwork completely outclassed the
redshirts. Jim Curtis. Arizona No. 2,
lead his team's scoring with eight
goals. Gregory Hathaway got three
1 for the visitors, while Captain Neil
son Brown and Jack Budlong each
tallied once.
Enemark Scores
Bill Enemark at No. 1 played a
j good game for Stanford and scored
the third Indian tally. Jim Hender
son played No. 4 for the Reds.
The two teams will meet again
| Wednesday and Friday afternoons in
I the remaining series contests. If
j Rasmussen and Fullerton are in
j shape, both contest should be very
j close.

i Hit by the last-minute unexpected
loss of two varsity stars, Stanford's
I poloists went down to defeat yester
day afternoon on the highway field
I before the attack of as sweet an out
, lit of polo players as has ever been
! seen in action here. When the dust
| of battle had settled, the scoreboard
read 13 fort the University of Ari
zona against 3 goals for the Red
-1 shirts.
Russ F.asmussen, regular No. 3,
was out of action as a result of be-,
ing struck on the knee in practice,
while No. 4 Bob Fullerton was in
1 the hospital with measles. The loss
lof these two regulars completely
: shot the offense and defense of Lieut.
| Grubbs' outfit.
Lack Teamwork
Lack of Indian teamwork and the
(excellent playing of the Wildcats
i contributed to the Stanford down
; fall, though the remaining varsity
; riders, Captain Bill Rogers and Carl
Beal, both turned in brilliant per
-1 formances. Rogers was all over the
i field and played a whale of a game.
1 Beal likewise was a tower of
| strength in the Card line-up and
i accounted for two beautiful scores.
Had the regular line-up been in, the
(game's result might have been very
; different.
Arizona's quartet amply justified
its reputation as the leading col
legiate aggregation in the West. De
spite the fact that the visitors were
I playing on strange mounts, their
teamwork completely outclassed the
redshirts. Jim Curtis. Arizona No. 2,
lead his team's scoring with eight
goals. Gregory Hathaway got three
1 for the visitors, while Captain Neil
son Brown and Jack Budlong each
tallied once.
Enemark Scores
Bill Enemark at No. 1 played a
j good game for Stanford and scored
the third Indian tally. Jim Hender
son played No. 4 for the Reds.
The two teams will meet again
