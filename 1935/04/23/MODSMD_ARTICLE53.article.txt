# Aspirants Vie For Positions On Grid Team
## 
### 
Stanford's spring football practice
looked almost like a business under- j
taking yesterday afternoon as new |
j aspirants to*l93ti Rose Bowl compe
j tition completed their activities in
| other sports and donned shoulder
I pads to join Tiny Thornhill's 50-odd
j gridmen.
In spite of the influx of candidates, |
| Thornhill was somewhat disgusted
j with his old timers as a result of the
! firs't scrimmage Friday. "I couldn't !
tell how the new formations looked," ,
|he complained, "they didn't even
know the plays."
Lacks Tackles
Tackles are Tiny's biggest worries.
He is fortified at least two deep at
| every other position, but in the im
portant line posts, he notices a de
-1 cided jumping-off place just be
yond All-American Bob Reynolds
and Dale Beedle. It is undecided
â–  whether Claude Callaway will be
i back to school next fall, and Tiny is
! anxiously looking over some of the
| frosh who have just reported to find
| some alternates for the two posi
tions.
With the conclusion of frosh track,
Tom Collins, Glenn Hamilton, and
j Grant Stone were free for grid work;
they limbered up yesterday, but little
| could be noticed concerning their
potentialities. Cy Oberg, yearling
! tackle, will not report until next
jweek; he plans to run hurdles in the
P.A.A. track meet here Saturday.

Rcisncr, Bronstein Race
John Reisner and Shelly Bronstein
| are staging a close race for the left
halfback position, vacated by Buck
I Van Dellen and Bob Maentz. Thorn
i hill expects Collins and Jimmy Cof
fis to enter into the competition be
j fore spring session is over. Tiny is
| using Bill Paulman as an alternate
fullback now and expressed himself
! as pleased with the freshman's kick
| ing and passing prowess. Joe Vigna
! is working in as a utility man at both
j right and left wing.
Tiny has concocted three forma
; tions, two from a balanced line and
one from an unbalanced line, and
I will scrimmage his squad for a few
j minutes during each practice from
now on, he said.
