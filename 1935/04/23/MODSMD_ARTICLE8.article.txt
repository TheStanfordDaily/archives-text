### 
HONOLULU, April 22 (/P». —'The
flying Clipper, groorped and fuelled,
was ready late today for a return
flight to California probably re
tracing its record-breaking course of
last week.
Officials of the Pan-American Air
ways announced the plane would
take off at 3:30 p.m. (6 p.m., P.S.T.)
Crew All Heady
The huge, four-motored flying
boat, which flew the 2400 miles be
tween Alameda, Calif., and here last
week in 17 hours and 45 minutes,
had 30,000 gallons of gasoline aboard,
more than sufficient for the return
trip.
The crew, headed by Captain Ed
win C. Mu.sick, was likewise ready
for ihe mainland hop after five days
in Hawaii during which the Clipper
made a survey flight around Oahu
island.
Breaks Old Record
With no more ado than is occa
sioned by a short pleasure cruise,
Captain Musick and his crew shaved
seven hours off previous records in
last week's flight which inaugurated
i preliminary commercial air service
| between the American mainland
and Honolulu. The Clipper on that
trip carried about 100 pounds of air
mail.

I not yet been announced.
