# Hitler Promises Action on Note
## 
### 
BERLIN, April 22 (/P).â€”A new
blast from Adolph Hitler at the
powers which condemned Germany
for rearming was promised soon by
a Foreign Office spokesman today as
the Reichsfuehrer deliberated over
it at his romantically situated moun
tain home at Hauswachenfeld, near
Berchtesgabcn.
There was a growing impression
here that further action following
Saturday's brief note to member na
tions of the league cannot be de
layed much longer, although there
was no prediction as to precisely
when or how it would be taken. It
was assumed there would be a de
tailed rebuttal of the Geneva con
demnation in any case.
Political Nazidom reflected a de
mand for more and more arms to
day to forestall a "hazardous at
tack" against Germany, and indorsed
vociferously Dcr Fuehrer's stand
against the powers.
A holiday aspect still prevailed in
the Wilhelmstrasse, where most of
ficials are still absent on Easter va-
J cations.
