# MAY 10 SET AS DATE FOR PLAY
## Veteran Cast Will Perform In 'Yellow Jack' 
### 
Only two weeks from Friday, May
10, has been set for the campus per
formance of "Yellow Jack," by Sid
ney Howard, probably the hist Dra
matic Council production of the year.
The curtain is slated to rise
promptly at 8:110 o'clock. Whether
or not the play will be followed by
an A.S.S.U. dance has not yet
been decided definitely.
With two weeks remaining for re
hearsals, almost perfect characteri
zations are expected, says Manager
Dick Frank. The cast of 26 veterans
was letter-perfect last week. Re
hearsals since then have consisted
of practices to individualize each
character. Even work on posture and
walking has been repeated time after
time to perfect each movement.
The hands, face, and eyes were
next given attention. Three re
hearsals were devoted to planning
each minute move of the features,
which must be exaggerated to
show up well beyond the foot
lights.
The cast began elimination of
faulty business Monday, wiping out
all the small faults it had acquired
during rehearsals. Today's practices
will continue the work of individual
izing the characters, and Saturday is
; set aside for a review of the entire
i play-
