# BECKER TRACES HUMAN TRENDS TOWARD UTOPIA
## Second in Series of West Memorial Lectures To Be Given Tonight 
### Cedric Larson 
From the uncouth Java-man of ;
prehistory, whom the anthropolo
gists in all scientific grandeur named
Pithecanthropus Erectus, to an ur
bane specimen of Homo Sapiens |
such as Mussolini or Roosevelt, man
has exhibited two striking charac
teristics which distinguish him from
all other creatures: the ability to j
implement himself with forces of j
nature, and the desire for power.
These are the bases of what is !
called loosely "progress" in human j
history, according to Professor 1
Carl L. Becker, Cornell historian, !
who last night delivered the initial
lecture: "Tools and the Man" of the j
twelfth series of the Raymond Fred j
West Memorial Lectures on the gen- j
eral topic, "Progress and Power."
Progress Told
The story of man's progress has j
been a chronicle of his subduing
elements of his environment. Man's |
first great discovery was the mastery
of fire. Later epoch making inven- j
tions were the alphabet, uses of j
metals, and conquest of the hidden [
forces of nature.
Progress means various things to j
different individuals. We are now)
in the long shadows of the world
war and may be entering into one
j of those recurring plateaus of atav
! ism in the social evolution curve of |
| mankind, the professor said. This
curve in the dawn of history was, |
I nearly a horizontal line, but with |
[the passage of time its almost im- j
'perceptible upward trend became!
| more marked, until with the last i
! millenium it has shown a sharp I
i upswing.
From the time of the remote Java
] man who experimented with the
; cutting qualities of a flint-edge to
i the perfection of the modern elec
j trie-eye which will open a door un-
I bidden, man has exhibited the same
'propensities ft utilize the forces of
: the planet and the universe. Prog- ■
; ress per se must be postulated upon
I this innate tendency of man.
Man W".nts Power
We think of the term "progress" j
loosely as a striving vaguely but j
irrepressibly toward some ultimate j
perfectability. With recorded history j
of only (>OOO years on which to base
I a premise, we find man eternally
j struggling to enter into a Utopia
ithus far always beyond the human j
grasp.
Tonight at 7:30 o'clock Professor I
Becker will deliver the second lec- I
i ture of the West Memorial series: j
"The Sword ;»nd the Pen." An am- |
plifying apparatus has been installed !
|in the Assembly Hall greatly im
| proving the acoustics.
