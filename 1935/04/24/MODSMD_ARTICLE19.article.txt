I see why we shouldn't, too."
Ex Committee's statement is
sued by Kahn follows: "The
Executive Committee wishes to
i make public statement to the cf-
I feet that in view of the testimony
of Richard Stark, head yell leader,
he carried out the tradition of >ell
leading and was not guilty of
; negligence in regard to the recent
J chaos at the Big Meet. The com
j mittcc feels that Mr. Stark was
i justified in his actions and tliTft
he should be absolved from the
; charges made against him. It is
j unfortunate that these charges
i were made because there has nev
er been precedent which would
i make it necessary or obligatory
for the ,\ell leaders to lend yells at
