UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN
CALIFORNIA—(CIPA) (By Radio). ]
—Silence on the political front was !
shattered here yesterday when lead- !
ers in Dick Parker's campaign for j
A.S.U.S.C. presidency invited the ,
first shot by announcing an open j
meeting in the Pi Kappa Alpha
house tonight.
The usual weeks of intrigue pro
ceeding any war have passed with
the usual amount of spying, counter
spying, tale-bearing, rumor-monger- ;
ing, and general behind-locked-door ■
work.
Parker has stirred the smooth- j
appearing surface of troubled po
litical waters. The presidential fight
will now be carried out with cigars,
refreshments, dances, speeches, and
back slapping.
