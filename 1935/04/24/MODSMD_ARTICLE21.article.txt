# INTERCOLLEGIATE NEWS EXCHANGE SERVICE STARTS
## 
### 
Today's paper marks ihe first
appearance of articles from
U.S.C. and U.C.L.A. in the re
cently established radio serv
ice for the exchange of news
between campuses.
Under the name of the Cali
fornia Intercollegiate Press As
sociation, the news exchange
service idea was devised by
Spud Hamilton, former asso
ciate editor of the Daily, and
Torn Lawless, managing editor
of the Daily Trojan, at a Sigma
Delta Chi convention in the
East last fall.
News from the various
schools is transmitted by the
amateur short-wave radio sta
tions of each university. Schools
connected by the service are
Stanford, U.S.C., and U.C.L.A.
Plans arc being made to have
California enter the association
also.
