# Election To Decide Balloting System, Sponsor Appointing
## Students Rale Preferential Vote, Choice of Women Leaders Tuesday DEBATERS GIVEN $20 Decision on Concert Series Manager Postponed 
### 
Stanford students will vote at the
Law School polls next Tuesday on
the questions of retaining the pref
erential ballot system for A.S.S.U.
elections and removal of the clausc
in regard to appointment of women
sponsors from the A.S.S.U. by-laws,
il was decided at Ex Committee
meeting last night.
The setting of the election was de
cided upon when the committee re
ceived a petition of 153 students
asking for the substitution of a plu
rality system for the preferential
system now used in A.S.S.U. elec
tions. No reason for the move ac
companied the petition, but dissat
isfaction with the present method
and the belief that it was to" com
plicated for students have been held
by some students. The plurality
method would give a leading candi
date an election if ho had at least
one vote more than his nearest com
petitor. Ex Committee did not dis
cuss the matter.
The women sponsors clause was
placed on the ballot on the re
quest of Marion Storey, Women's
Conference president, who pointed
out that due to changing condi
tions of women sponsors, that such
by-laws should be placed among
those of Women's Conference
rather than with the general
A.S.S.U. by-laws, since they would
be subject to more flexible control
in the former. This was agreed to
by Ex Committee.
While wide-eyed visitors from
California Women's Executive Com
mittee watched the wondrous work
ings of Stanford legislation, the com
mittee put down several minor up
heavals from the Publications Coun
cil and the Concert Series.

[ graphed a request to Ex Committee

Stanford students will vote at the
Law School polls next Tuesday on
the questions of retaining the pref
erential ballot system for A.S.S.U.
elections and removal of the clausc
in regard to appointment of women
sponsors from the A.S.S.U. by-laws,
il was decided at Ex Committee
meeting last night.
The setting of the election was de
cided upon when the committee re
ceived a petition of 153 students
asking for the substitution of a plu
rality system for the preferential
system now used in A.S.S.U. elec
tions. No reason for the move ac
companied the petition, but dissat
isfaction with the present method
and the belief that it was to" com
plicated for students have been held
by some students. The plurality
method would give a leading candi
date an election if ho had at least
one vote more than his nearest com
petitor. Ex Committee did not dis
cuss the matter.
The women sponsors clause was
placed on the ballot on the re
quest of Marion Storey, Women's
Conference president, who pointed
out that due to changing condi
tions of women sponsors, that such
by-laws should be placed among
those of Women's Conference
rather than with the general
A.S.S.U. by-laws, since they would
be subject to more flexible control
in the former. This was agreed to
by Ex Committee.
While wide-eyed visitors from
California Women's Executive Com
mittee watched the wondrous work
ings of Stanford legislation, the com
mittee put down several minor up
heavals from the Publications Coun
cil and the Concert Series.
