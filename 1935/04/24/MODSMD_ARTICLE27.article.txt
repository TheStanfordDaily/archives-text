# More Contributions To a Worthy Cause
## 
### 
Am excel lent idea lias been proposed by
A.S.S.I'. head Marvie Kahn, in regard to tick
ets sold lor the ill-fated benefit track meet
sponsored by Skull and Snakes.
The 2f>-cent tickets purchased by students
have been redeemable at the R.A.C., and will
continue to be so until the end of the week.
At the end of this time, however, whatever
sum of money remains will be turned over to
the benefit of Ihe Convalescent Home.
Rain and a muddy track contributed to flic
permanent cancellation of a track meet which
was to have helped send men back to the pro
posed 1.C.4-A. meet this year. The sum real
ized from the sale of these tickets exceeded
a few hundred dollars, and undoubtedly many
students will not go over to the B.A.C. to claim
I heir refunds.
People who bought tickets tlie first time did
so because they felt they would be aiding a
worthy cause. If thev tail to call lor their
refunds this week, their pocketbooks will not
suil'er, but they will be helping to swell con
tributions to the Convalescent Home.
So here is a good chance to fail to do some
thing, and, by this unusual expedient, help to
attain a new high in the charity drive. The
way to do it is, simply forget about your
origi mil investment.
