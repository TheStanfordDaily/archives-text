# The 						Yell Leader Exonerated
## 
### 
Last night the Executive Committee ab
solved the chic! veil loader of any blame in
connection with the lack of organized rooting
at the !iig Meet last Saturday at Berkeley.
II was satisfactorily proved to the commit
tee that in the past there had been no yell
leader present when teams competed in meets
at the other school. At least, such was the case
for I lie past three years. Tins would mean,
for instance, that two years ago at California
111.< Cardinal yell kings led cheers, and that
last year in the Stanford stadium, no Califor
nia yell leaders were present to cheer for I heir
cinder artists.
Since the present Stanford yell leader was
following tradition, he is undoubtedly tree of
blame for last Saturday's cheerless section.
However, the basic fault sliil lies uncorrected.
Whether there should be yell leaders present
to lead yells for a representative team and lead
I lie Stanford section in the hymn, was shelved
by the Kx Committee as something to be de
cided at some future lime, since il was irrele
vant lo the issue.
Numerous faculty members, many alumni
feel that even if in the past there has been
no yell leader present, there should be one.
The Si'A\l'oiU) Daily concurs in this belief.
Last Saturday's unorganized section is plenty
evidence of this contention.
Whether it is a track team or a football team
competing, for the athletes il is their !il(i
meeting of the year when they meet Califor
nia, and in future years the presence of a yell
leader is highly desirable.
