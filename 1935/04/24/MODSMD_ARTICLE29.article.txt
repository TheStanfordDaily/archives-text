# There Is Still Trouble at Menlo
## 
### 
Alter n let-up last week the Peninsula's
liquor war again moves under way. Menlo
Junior (College, however, is Ihe seene Miis week
n| the latest llare-up. And shulliing up to the
war-zone routes the notoriously "uninformed"
Hoard of Equalization, still unmindful of ex
isting conditions.
President I.owry S. Howard of the Menlo
institution rails the San Mateo supervisors'
attention to the liquor sales which. In* claims,
are being made to minors hi the \iciniiy of the
school. He further states that two resorts are
operating within a few hundred yards of the
college and a third preparing to open for
business. He asks the board to establish zone
rest fiction s in the area between Atherton and
Menlo Park.

Supervisor Albert Witt of Colnia says it is
ii I> t'> the State Hoard of Equalization to en
loree any such violations. Peter Hazovich, law
enlorceinent officer lor the equalization hoard,
retorts, however, becoming the custom of the
enforcing body, that it is news to him that
liquor sales are being made to minors in that
area.
I irst the equalization board bungles the
Mcnlo Park Stanford controversy by its "un
inlormed" attitude, .lames Corbet I expresses
fantastic beliefs of the existence of a bar on
the campus here. The Daily informs him to
the contrary. Now the hoard resumes its usual
non-committal attitude. The voters are apt to
lire of I his perennial ignorance.
