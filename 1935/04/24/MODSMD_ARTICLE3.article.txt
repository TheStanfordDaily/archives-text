# Chappie Judges Choose Beauties For Love Issue
## 
### 
The Chappie office was in the
utmost confusion yesterday, as
the judges without grudges
were busy determining the
lovely girls without churls,
who won the loveliest girl
contest conducted to determine
the 1G women that will appear
in the "Love" issue.
Results of the vote will be
a strict secret until the
appearance of the May issue,
according to Editor Gordon
Steedman. Copy and art dead
line for this issue is next Fri
day, according to Steedman.
"There will be no late leaves,"
he says.
