# BOULDER DAM
## WITH LAWRENCE WASHINGTON 
### CEDRIC LARSON 
(Editor's Note: This is the first of h series of
three articles on Boulder Dam and its significance
to the Southwest, based 011 a survey of Profes
sor Lawrence Washington of the School of Engi
neering of the huge project in March, 1 fllio.)
The engineers who stood on the lofty parapet of
volcanic rock some four years ago above the site of
Boulder Dam saw below them nothing but the jagged
V-shaped canyon walls of the foaming Colorado River,
itself a silver ribbon more than 600 feet below. Only
in their mind's eye could they picture the task of
building the greatest dam in the world's history, which
would check forever the recurrent hazards of floods
from the intractable Colorado.
Today the dam its creators envisioned is 72(5
feet high, nearly as tall as the Woolworth Build
ing. measuring from foundation rock to crest, and
6.10 feet thick at the base. The materials going
into the huge project weigh some 6,600,000 tons,
and the concrete required for the whole job would
build a monument 10!) feet square, two and one
eighth miles high. This concrete would build a
standard 16-foot wide highway from Miami, Flor
ida, to Seattle, Washington. In all more than
4,200,000 cubic yards of concrete are required.
Due to artificial cooling, more than 160,000 yards
of concrete have been laid per month on the average.
A reservoir is now in the making which will be 115
miles long, 227 square miles in area (Lake Tahoe covers
103 square miles), with 550 miles of shore line.
The Boulder Canyon Project Act authorizes appro
priations not to exceed 8165,000,000, and work was
started in June, 1931, by Six Companies, inc., of San
Francisco. From 3,500 to 5.000 men are employed per
month, with the monthly payroll averaging $500,000.
The dam is 25 miles southeast of Las Vegas, Nevada,
where the Colorado River in the upper Black Canyon
forms the Arizona-Nevada State boundary.
The general purposes of the dam are for taming
the floodwaters of the Colorado River, as well as for
irrigation, power creation, silt control, and domestic
water supply. The crest of the dam is I,IHO feet long,
and a highway 45 feet wide will ultimately run across
the top. The dam extends from 110 to 130 feet below
the low-water surface of the river to its foundation.
"Boulder Dam is by far the highest in the
world," states Professor Washington. "Next in
height comes the 446-foot Sautet Dam in France,
now under construction. The great mass of Boul
der Dam is honeycombed with a system -of cooling
pipes which was used to remove the heat gener
ated by the concrete as it set. A total of 570 miles
of one-inch steel tubing wvs used in the cooling
system.
"Spaced 011 about 5-foot centers, the pipes carried
water which had previously been cooled either by air
or by the refrigerating plant, depending upon the stage
of setting of the concrete."
Although six years were allowed to build the dam,
work has been rushed forward day and night, and
with the artificial cooling of the concrete, the Six
Companies are today 18 months ahead of schedule in
construction.

eighth miles high. This concrete would build a
standard 16-foot wide highway from Miami, Flor
ida, to Seattle, Washington. In all more than
4,200,000 cubic yards of concrete are required.
Due to artificial cooling, more than 160,000 yards
of concrete have been laid per month on the average.
A reservoir is now in the making which will be 115
miles long, 227 square miles in area (Lake Tahoe covers
103 square miles), with 550 miles of shore line.
The Boulder Canyon Project Act authorizes appro
priations not to exceed 8165,000,000, and work was
started in June, 1931, by Six Companies, inc., of San
Francisco. From 3,500 to 5.000 men are employed per
month, with the monthly payroll averaging $500,000.
The dam is 25 miles southeast of Las Vegas, Nevada,
where the Colorado River in the upper Black Canyon
forms the Arizona-Nevada State boundary.
The general purposes of the dam are for taming
the floodwaters of the Colorado River, as well as for
irrigation, power creation, silt control, and domestic
water supply. The crest of the dam is I,IHO feet long,
and a highway 45 feet wide will ultimately run across
the top. The dam extends from 110 to 130 feet below
the low-water surface of the river to its foundation.
"Boulder Dam is by far the highest in the
world," states Professor Washington. "Next in
height comes the 446-foot Sautet Dam in France,
now under construction. The great mass of Boul
der Dam is honeycombed with a system -of cooling
pipes which was used to remove the heat gener
ated by the concrete as it set. A total of 570 miles
of one-inch steel tubing wvs used in the cooling
system.
"Spaced 011 about 5-foot centers, the pipes carried
water which had previously been cooled either by air
or by the refrigerating plant, depending upon the stage
of setting of the concrete."
Although six years were allowed to build the dam,
work has been rushed forward day and night, and
with the artificial cooling of the concrete, the Six
Companies are today 18 months ahead of schedule in
construction.

The engineers who stood on the lofty parapet of
volcanic rock some four years ago above the site of
Boulder Dam saw below them nothing but the jagged
V-shaped canyon walls of the foaming Colorado River,
itself a silver ribbon more than 600 feet below. Only
in their mind's eye could they picture the task of
building the greatest dam in the world's history, which
would check forever the recurrent hazards of floods
from the intractable Colorado.

6.10 feet thick at the base. The materials going
