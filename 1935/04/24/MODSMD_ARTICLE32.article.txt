Just what the capacity of a glee club member is
might well be the subject of a lab experiment. 1 have
heard that in a recent glee club bus trip three pints of
the juice of the grape was sufficient to send all the
boys off key—not that they were keyed up or :'ven a
bit high, or off-color, they were just off key. Some
phonetics, eh kid?
Not content to nave their neighbors across the street
perform a bit of folderol and get mentioned in ,his
remarkable column, the local chapter of Phi Delta
i Theta staged an informal house-warming (not to be
confused with "Smoky Joe" Martin's finals-week fire)
and a minor rebellion last Friday.
The cause is really revealed in the workings of
this insidious Communistic propaganda that is under
mining the innocent minds of the flower of American
manhood and womanhood, engendering risre«-pect for
authority and the ideals of life, liberty, and the pursuit.
It seems that some of the radicals in the Phi Delt
house spotted "The Iron Duke," the house president,
and "Weedy," the house manager, returning from the
library at 3 o'clock Friday night (or Saturday morning).
The result was the enkindling of the fires of re
bellion in the savage breast, and though both gentle
men politely but firmly rang the doorbell, they could
not gain admittance to the sacred precincts. This con
■ tinned for some time. And the din was so terrific that
I the Deegees next door turned over in their graves.

Tiie two wielders of authority tried the resource
of climbing up to the :»leeping porch, hut they were
greeted with a salvo ot water, as the wailing sopho
mores shed tears on them.
The dawn rose rosy-fingered, and found our two
heroes sick with the loss of sleep, until finally they
won their way in through entreaties and calling upon
i the law-abiding spirit of the house to come to their
rescue.
After it was all over, the boys got together and
decided it was cheaper to have a nice, inexpensive con
i flaeration.
