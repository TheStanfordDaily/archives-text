"THE WlfOl E TOWN'S TALKINCi"
At tlic California Theater
A terrific gangster melodrama,
very often breath-taking "in it.-; ex
citement, this film give-, Edward G.
Robinson perhaps his greatest act
ing opportunity. He is first seen as
ihe self-center
ed, obsequious
little office
drudge, Arthur
Fen gu&on J ones,
and the n a s
"Kilk r" M a n -
niun, terror of
the underworld.
Robinson's performance is a never
to-be-forgotten cinema gem, rich in
detail, minute inner analysis, mood
revelation, and sense of comic val
ues. Perhaps his finest moment is
when he has Jones, famous over
night because of his re.-x-rnblance to
the gangster, meet the man who, for
the nonce, he believes he is. The
"Killer'" has decided to take over
the clerk's personality, in order to
shield his own activities. This gives
rise to a series of fascinating adven
tures which, even though they are
not basically novel, are ingeniously
developed, and are gloriously hila
rious as well. The picture is aided
not a little by Jean Arthur, who

here reveals a striking personality,
and is quite splendid as the .some
what fllippant stenographer who
manages to transform little Mr. Jones
into the sort of person she'd like him
to be. Miss Arthur, Robinson, spicy
dialogue, and clever, swift direction
make this one of the distinctly bet

ter Hollywood releases of the sea

It all the ic«' in Greelaiid and Ant

would be added to the oceans to
i aise their level 150 feet.
