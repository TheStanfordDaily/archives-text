# EAST MILERS WILL COMPETE IN P.A.A. TRACK MEET HERE
## Bright, Card Ineligible, Has Run 2-Mile in 9:22 
### Warren Breed 
A great race looms in the mile
Saturday afternoon when some of
the best four-lap men in the We-t
meet in the Pacific Athletic Asso
ciation meet here on the Stanford
oval.
Bright To Run
Heading the list will be Norm
Blight, the Card ineligible, who will
be running one of the few races he
gets a chance to enter every year.
Blight's best time this year was a
two-mile in 9:22.
Then from the varsity are Warren
Dixon and Chuck Nimmo. Both
tried shorter races yesterday in
practice, and showed some real
speed. Dixon did a 440 in , r >l.9; Nim
mo ran perhaps the best race ol his
season so far with a half-mile in
1,57. •
Burrows May Enter
Other probable entrants are Ed
Burrows, captain of the i'rosh team,
who has run 4:23 last year, but took
a long time getting into shape this
spring; Elroy Robinson, the Fresno
State middle-distance man, of whom
many superlatives are spoken; and
possibly some of the California run
ners who are not bothered by im
pending finals.
Bright was trying to get up a
special two-mile, so he would have
a chance for the record, but the man
he wanted to race against, Bob Fow
ler of Cal, was barred by his coach,
Brutus Hamilton. Bright is in a
good position to make a strong bid
for the Olympic Games team next
year.
Plans for Troy
Meanwhile Coach Dink Temple
ton is working the rest of his men
right along, with an eye for the Troy
meet two weeks hence. There is
every possibility that, after more or
less of a breather Saturday, as far
as team honors go, the Cards will ba
in peak condition to score as many or
more points against the Trojans than
they did against Cal. Two weeks of
solid workouts in the present weath
er conditions can do wonders for
the team that started out so badly.
