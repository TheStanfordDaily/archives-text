## SAD FATE OF BUNN'S PROPOSAL 
### 
The ardent hoop fans of Califor
nia were disappointed when John
Bunn of Stanford basketball in his
visit to the recent national confer
ence of coaches and officials failed
to secure a more complete elimi
nation of the center jump, and not
the least disappointed of these was
Bunn himself.
Bunn has won the title of "gentle
man coach," but he had a hard time
speaking pleasantly of the treatment
his proposal received. He went to
Chicago with the unanimous back
ing of the southern half of the Pa
cific Coast Conference, and of the
corresponding fans, for the removal
of the center jump, except for the
opening of the two halves and fol
lowing double fouls. The success
of the measure seemed likely when
a national poll of the Rules Com
mittee brought a 50-50 response plus
the enthusiastic support of those
coaches who had tried the reform.
But lobbying, porkbarreling,
and logrolling famed as legisla
tive abuses, is minutia compared
with the treatment the bigwigs of
the convention gave Bunn's pro
posal. Besides the use of false
facts on the part of its opponents,
the measure was left to the last
minute, when a goodly number of
the delegates had already left the
Windy City for their respective
hardwood courts.
The result was that the measure
lost by three votes in 100 plus. It was
disappointing, but not so much so
when it is realized that the same
body was unanimous against it lasi.
year. Bunn plans to try again next
year.
In the meantime the Coast Con
ference, southern division, will
probably use the jump as spar
ingly as they did in the season
just closed. That is, if there are
no violent objections at the confer
ence of U.S.C., U.C.L.A., Califor
nia. and Stanford officials pending.
The real purpose of the confer
ence, by the way, is to formulate
some policy toward St. Mary's,
Santa Clara, and San Francisco
University and the entrance of these
three schools into the basketball
league, which should be worth con
siderable news matter later in the
month.
