# SHOULD HAVE A TWO-MILE SATURDAY
## 
### 
If the P.A.A. officials want to have
a drawing card for their meet in
the Stadium Saturday they will get
a two-mile run put on the program.
Norm Bright is anxious to see just
how fast he can run in competition,
and the result is almost certain of
being the fastest two-mile run on
the Coast since the 1932 Olympic
Games. His 9 minutes and 22 sec
onds race without competition a
while ago is a mere 17 seconds under

] the 8-year-old Big Meet record.
Bright figures that he will hit 9:15
j if things go right, and his easy 6:50
for six laps several days ago would
place him well under that time,
i Should the officials permit the race,
Bright will have Edson Burrows of
the -frosh for competition, and pos
sibly Rusty March. California's Bob
Fowler won't be down—"Finals," he
| says, and from one who subjected a
j promising track season to all sorts of
dangers for a geology field trip, that's
enough.
With or without Fowler, Bright
, should h>.ve a chance to run the
I two-mile. Scholastic rulings have
already blasted his competitive
' opportunities at Stanford, and the
j P.A.A. race will merely give the
local fans a chance to sec what
Stanford lost.
