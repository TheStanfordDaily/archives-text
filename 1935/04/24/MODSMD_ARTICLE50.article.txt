# YEARLINGS HELP TRACK OUTLOOK

"Successful" is a term that Coach
Bill Ellington will hardly use in ref
erence to his frosh track team of
1935, but from Varsity Coach Dink
Templeton's point of view the /past
season is well described by that term.
Bill will hesitate to call the season
; success because out of five meets
his team won but two, and one of
Ihe three defeats was administered
by California freshmen. On the oth
er hand, Bill can hardly blame his
team or himself for the losses. Bad
weather coupled with bad breaks
can be credited for most of the set
backs.
Last Friday the yearlings' de
feat at the hands of the Bear frosh
was by a four-point margin—so close
that a break might have turned the
tide. Bill believes that that tide
might have turned had Lady Luck
favored the Cards but since she did
not, Ellington has no complaint to
make for his team.
Dink, however, can call the year
ling season a success by virtue of the
fact that at least half a dozen poten
tial winners for next season came
forth.
Etlson Burrows, BXO, mile and
two-mile; Jim Kncuhuhl, sprints;
Cy Oherg and Ken Peters, hur
dles: Oito Beringer, discus; Hank
Lnisetti. high jump—all these will
bear watching when the 1936
track season rolls around.
Burrows is perhaps the most
promising of the lot, his mile times
have shown him to be capable of
standing high in varsity competition,
Kneubuhl has the speed to go far
in sprints and Oberg's low hurdling
form this year has been indicative
of winning performances in the lu
lu re.
