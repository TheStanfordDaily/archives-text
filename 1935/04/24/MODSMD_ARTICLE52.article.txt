# BILL ROGERS ONLY POLO REGULAR TO PLAY TODAY
## 
### 
Injuries and sickness have cut the
tanks of Stanford's ill-fated polo
team down to one first-string player.
Captain Bill Rogers, and the second
string squad. The loss of the serv
ices of the three varsity stars cut
Stanford's chances of winning over
Arizona this afternoon for the Far
West championship to a minimum.
Second in Series
The Cards will face the fast squad
irom Arizona in the second of a
three-game series, the first game
being won by Arizona 13-3. The
match will start at 3:30 o'clock on
the highway field.
Lacking the stellar playing of Ras
mu.-sen, No. 3, Carl Beal, No. 1, and
Bob Fullerton, No. 4, Captain Bill
Rogers will lead the squad today

1 composed of Bill Enemark at No. 1
position, Jim Henderson at No. 3,
and Ed McKeon at No. 4.
Chances Slight
Through playing together for con
siderable time, the second string has
developed a teamwork which should
be superior to the mixed squad of
Monday's game. Though
chances are slim, the Arizona team
will be forced to show some real
action.
The Arizona team, which is the
greatest of a long line of cham
pionship teams, will probably have
,lhe same line-up that featured Mon
! day's meet. Gregory Hathaway will
play No. 1, Jim Curtis No. 2, Jack
Budlong No. 3, and Captain Neilson
1 Brown at No. 4.
