I MONTEREY, April 23
tenant Russell E. Laird of Riverside
I and Private Bernard F. Rygwalski
I of Cleveland, Ohio, of the Army Air
| Corps' 91st Observation Squadron
j were killed today in the crash of
, their burning plane into Monterey
! Bay.
j Several other army planes, includ-
I ing an amphibian and a number of
i fishing boats circled the spot more
1 than an hour in the hope of picking
up the fliers or their bodies. No
I trace of the men was found, how
j ever, and only an oil spot marked
j the point where the plane went
| down.
! Those familiar with the bay said
j the plane had' come down in be
; tween 50 and 60 feet of water. The
! bay was too rough this afternoon for
[ the amphibian to alight.
