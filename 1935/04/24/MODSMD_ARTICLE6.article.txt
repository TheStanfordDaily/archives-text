## 
### 
The name of the usual "Bean Day''
I will have to be changed this year to
I "Bean and Apple Day," owing to the
' donation by the Watsonville Cham
] ber of Commerce of 2500 apples, to
!be used with the 1000 pounds of
! beans given by the King City Cham
: ber of Commerce. These beans are
, to be served for lunch in all the cam
; pus living groups on Monday, April
! 29, along with the Watsonville apples
for dessert.
The beans and apples will be de
livered to the living groups some
time Friday or Saturday, Chairman
■ Wally Brooke said yesterday. Checks
! for the difference between the six-
I cent meal and the regular 35-cent
| meal will be collected at the living
groups by the drive treasurer Mon
day afternoon.
There has been some misunder
standing in some of the living groups
between the money saved on the
Bean Day and the $5 asked by Ben
| Cave for the barbecue to be held at
the Convalescent Home after Labor
Day, May 1. These are two separate
funds, Brooke said, and house man
logers are requested to send the
i checks for the barbecue to Ben Cave
but to keep the Bean Day money till
the drive treasurer calls for it.
