# Pettigrew, Walton Win Thrones With Coalition of Houses
## Sorority Backers Combine To Avert Rising Vote For Hall Women WALTMAN ADDS GAINS Queen Asks Row Entries To Appear in Court 
### Irvin Jorgensen 
A lust-minute coalition of sorority
women, smarting under a bizarre
publicity campaign conducted by
Lagunitaite Helen "Them There
Eyes" Ramming, which featured ex
tensive advertising in The Daily and
a sky-writing airplane lhat startled
noon-day crowds on the Quad,
placed Nancy "Fancy" Pettigrew
into first place for Masque Ball
queen with 85,025 votes yesterday
afternoon.
Jack "I'll Be Ilard To Handle"
Walton was a tower of strength
with 25,6fi2 votes, advancing onto
the king's throne over the prostrate
body of "Wildman" Winstead
Weaver, valiantly maintaining
total of 19,046.
Yesterday's penny-ballot struggle
was conceded the greatest in Masque
Ball history by successful and un
successful candidates, as "Old Trap
per" Bill Waltman, clutching hun-

dred dollar bills and fifty dollar
checks announced that he was out of
the woods with $763.86 more money
than any previous contest had col
lected.
Houses Co-operate
The sorority pool that elected Pct
tigrew was effected at .5:10 o'clock
yesterday afternoon, 5 minutes be
fore the polls closed, when Kow
backers of five candidates, fearful
of a Hall victory and the high-pres
sure support given by Helen Ram
ming's backers, swung over to the
Alpha Phi candidate, who was in
possession of the largest potential
majority.
Added to her own support was the
money from the backers of Leslie
"Royal Family" Huntington, Kappa
Kappa Gamma; Virginia "Smoothie"
Parker, Delta Gamma; Bctte
"Breezy" Brock. Gamma Phi Beta,
and Nancy "I Like You Too" Pol
lock, Alpha Phi pledge.
A last minute plunge of money
from the Zcte house insured the
success of Walton, backed also by
Alpha Delts and Phi Delts, over
Weaver, who drew on his Bet l *
brothers ami Chi Psi neighbors.
The 15 minutes of secret bidding,
an innovation of last year, proved
the downfall of many of the con
tributors who never expected the
'35 contest to surpass last years
embroglio.
