# 'Sword, Pen' Is Subject Of Becker Talk
## Cornell Professor To Give Third Talk Tonight 
### Cedric Larson 
"If the sword seems mightier than
the pen it is because the pen is less
noisy," remarked visiting Professor
Carl L. Becker of Cornell Univer
sity last, night in his address: "The
Sword and the Pen," the second
lecture of the 1935 West Memorial
series on the topic, "Progress and
Power."
The sword and the pen at. least
since writing became a common
place share an inextricably inter
blent influence in shaping the des
tiny of man. A written code bind
ing together a modern political en
tity is upheld by the sword. With
out the sword the pen would have
little to do but cast up accounts and
keep prosaic records.
Traces Society Change
The historian glimpsed four epochs
in the social development of man.
The first and by far the longest, was
typified by the dawn-man, the "pure
extrovert," unsociable and fierce,
whose interests were confined solely
to the moment at hand. Next came
the shaggy troglodyte crouching
with his fellows about, the strange
new element known as fire. Soon
animals were domesticated, com
munal life evolved, and accumulated
knowledge transmitted ffrom one
generation to the following.
The third era extends from the
discovery of writing to the utiliza
tion of magnetic force, and is by far
the most significant. "Writing in
creased the power of man's mind just
as the flint hatchet increased the
power of his hand," said the his
torian.
Describes Stratification
As tribal society crystallized into
the political state, six social hier
archies manifested themselves: at
the base of the social pyramid was
the slave, and tapering above him to
the king at the apex,«were succes
sively the peasantry, town-dwellers
(artisans and mechanics), privileged
land owners, priests and scribes, and
the civil and military classes.
Society next underwent stratifica
tion, hardships accumulated and a
[succession of social maladies super
imposed themselves on each other:
tyrants on nations, war on tyrants,
I pestilence on war, starvation on pes-
I tilcnce and disintegration on evcry
, thing. Empire swallows empire —
Babylon is absorbed by Persia, Pcr
: sia gives way to Greece, which in
turn bows before the legions of
Rome.
INlan Envisions Utopia
Amid all of these catastrophes,
! man looks fondly back at some gold
en age, surveys his then sorry state,
I and feels uneasy about the future.
I The prophet, poet and philosopher—
; Solompn, Job, Socrates, Plato—en
vision a day when man will banish
his mundane woes and enter the
long sought Utopia of human fc
| licity.
Tonight Professor Becker deliv
ers the concluding lecture, "Instru
j ments of Precision," in the West Me
morial scries, in the Assembly Hall
at 7:30. .
