# UNIVERSITY CONTROL OF DRAMATICS
## 
### 
(Editorial)
The present system of student control of dramatics on
; the campus appears doomed. From the source in actual
j control of the dramatics situation came a resolution yestcr-
I day to the elicit that it would he best for the control of
| Stanford dramatics to he vested in University jurisdiction.!
In making this decision, the Dramatics (Council was
making no grandstand play, nor was it acting without due
deliberation and thought upon the question, Jn its present ■
! status, the council feels that student control is jeopardizing!
the future prestige and artistic accomplishments of campus!
; dramatics.
Meetings were held with Dr. Wilbur on the subject of
transferring control of dramatics from the student body to
the University., Such a move is favored, on the condition
that should this step be taken, it would mean that hence-!
I forth students would have no authority in determining!
: policy in regard to anv dramatics on the campus.
The most important single factor in determining yester
day's resolution results from looking ahead to the future
! of dramatics at Stanford. Next year a new theater will be!
! begun, and ready for practical occupancy a short time after,
groundbreaking.
With the new facilities of this theater, it would be ex
tremely short-sighted to provide only for student control
of dramatics. Financial limitations upon plays, a very liin-j
ited type of instruction, and poor artistic results in a beau
tifully equipped building seem paradoxical.
Shifting control to University jurisdiction will allow for
an expansion of the dramatics program, a well-staffed fac
i ulty, and the beginning of a School of the Theater. The
i present spectacle of campus talent migrating to the Palo j
I Alio Community Theater, where it feels better opportuni-!
ties are afforded, would undoubtedly be halted.
Opposing views to the resolution taken by the Dramatics
Council are voiced in other columns of the Daily. 1 lowever,
j any plan which would call for a division of authority he-'
| tween faculty and students would prove incompatible. It
would be impractical to employ any set-up allowing stu
, dei,its to exercise sonic degree of authority under faculty'
i supervision, or vice versa. Either dramatics must remain
| a dent activity, or it must be absolutely shifted to Uni-j
vers ' control.
For the sake of future drama on the campus, it would;
seem thai the latter move is the wiser one, and would in i
ihe end p.ove most beneficial to the students. However,!
the Dramatics Council did not in any way construe its reso
lution to mean that should dramatics remain under control
I of the Associated Students, its present status would be al
j tered.
This resolution is a wise move toward establishing what
I is sorely needed at Stanford—a well-staffed School of the
Theater, and a renaissance of campus dramatics. As such, |
| it deserves support.
