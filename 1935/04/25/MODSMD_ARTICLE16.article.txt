# Storey Warns Of German Measles Peril to Campus
## 
### 
An increasing number of
cases of "German Measles" oc
curring here on the campus
leads me to ask you to m.<Vkc
the following facts public: This
disease is practically always
harmless. It may, however,
mask something worse. It is
communicated from sick person
to well person. Early isola
tion is the only safe procedure,
particularly in a campus situa
tion such as we have here at
Stanford. Control is possible
only by getting cases into iso
lation early. The men and
women of Stanford can help us
protect our campus community
by reporting to the Health
Services for men or women
without delay in case they feel
that they are "taking cold."
