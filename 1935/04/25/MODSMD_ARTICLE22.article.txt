## Cave, Ransom Express Opinions on Action 
### 
Dr. Wilbur's Statement
Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur, when
contacted last night, said that, al
though he had not been officially
informed of the council's action,
their decision would be satisfactory
with him. However, he added, any
financial liabilities hanging over the
council's head would probably have
to be settled with the A.S.S.U. be
fore the University would act.
Ben Cave's Statement
"The Dramatic Council owes the
student body $1000. The Dramatic
Council can make money as it proved
by earning a net income of $600 last
year, and reducing its debt to the
present $1000. But now it proposes
to dissolve itself and make it im
possible for the Associated Students
to collect the debt for the most ob
vious of reasons —because the debtor
will not exist."
Ransom Statement
Robert Ransom, who presented the
resolution to the council and con
ferred with Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur
011 its feasibility, stated: "The coun
cil's action in recommending to Dr.
Wilbur that Stanford dramatics,
financially and administratively, be
assumed by the University is simply
the cumulation of the growing feel
ing during the last few years that it
is only through faculty control that
there is any possibility of putting
dramatics on a firm footing at Stan
ford. It should be obvious that while
the dramatic director is a mere hire
ling of the students, will be no
incentive for the University either to
increase the dramatics faculty or to
encourage the growths of a Stanford
School of the Theater."
