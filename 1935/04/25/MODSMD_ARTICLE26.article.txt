# Dramatics Council Asks University Control
## Students Unable To Govern New Campus Theater Resolution Requests Wilbur To Terminate System Now Being' Used GRIEVANCES STATED Board Suggests Instituting Theatrical School 
### 
By Henry Brill
"Who will run the new $500,000
thealer which is to be built next,
year?" This is the question that
Dramatic Council, in so many words,
dropped into the lap of the campus
yesterday when it passed a resolu
tion to advise Dr. Ray Lyman Wil
bur that "student control of dra
matics is jeopardizing the future
prestige and possible artistic accom
plishments of Stanford dramatics."
Further, the Council requested
that a communication be sent to
Dr. Wilbur advising him that the
resolution be accepted by the Uni
versity, and "that control of Stan
ford dramatics be officially trans
ferred from student to University
jurisdiction on the day of the clos
ing the Dramatic Council books
for the year 1934-1935."
Among the grievances responsible
for the drastic change are those
stated in the body of the resolution.
"The Council points to the drastic
reduction in (he number of plays
produced and the extreme limita
tions imposed by a one-man dra
matics faculty as evidence of the
truth of the statement that there is
no future, artistically or financially,
in the present set-up of dramatics
at Stanford University. The Coun
cil further feels that indications of
the decadence of Stanford dramatics
at the present time is to be found in
the fact that the large majority of
Stanford talent expends its energies
at the Palo Alto Community Theater
instead of on campus productions."
The council members, from
whom the resolution arose spon
taneously, were practically unan
imous in condemning the present
system. A School of the Theater,
rivaling that headed by George
Pierce Baker of Yale, is the coun
cil's opinion of an ideal set-up.
Such an organization would give
an opportunity for real training
and experience, without hamper
ing untrained student leaders with
its administrative and financial
operative problems.
The planned change would not
mean the complete end of student
participation, nor the end of such
| student groups as Sword and San
, dais or Ramshead. Under the new
set-up a student advisory board
would bo a distinct possibility.
111 a last attempt to reduce their
deficit the council decided to restore
the Spring Musical. This produc
tion, which they hope will be their
( last, is scheduled for May 31. It is
, to be in the nature of an Intimate
Revue and will feature sketches by
Dorothy Parker and George Kauf
! matin, combined with original stu
-1 dent work. Those interested are
asked to sec the representative of
the council in the Old Union, Com
-1 iniltce Room 4, at 4:"0 this after
noon.

"Who will run the new $500,000
thealer which is to be built next,
year?" This is the question that
Dramatic Council, in so many words,
dropped into the lap of the campus
yesterday when it passed a resolu
tion to advise Dr. Ray Lyman Wil
bur that "student control of dra
matics is jeopardizing the future
prestige and possible artistic accom
plishments of Stanford dramatics."
Further, the Council requested
that a communication be sent to
Dr. Wilbur advising him that the
resolution be accepted by the Uni
versity, and "that control of Stan
ford dramatics be officially trans
ferred from student to University
jurisdiction on the day of the clos
ing the Dramatic Council books
for the year 1934-1935."
Among the grievances responsible
for the drastic change are those
stated in the body of the resolution.
"The Council points to the drastic
reduction in (he number of plays
produced and the extreme limita
tions imposed by a one-man dra
matics faculty as evidence of the
truth of the statement that there is
no future, artistically or financially,
in the present set-up of dramatics
at Stanford University. The Coun
cil further feels that indications of
the decadence of Stanford dramatics
at the present time is to be found in
the fact that the large majority of
Stanford talent expends its energies
at the Palo Alto Community Theater
instead of on campus productions."
The council members, from
whom the resolution arose spon
taneously, were practically unan
imous in condemning the present
system. A School of the Theater,
rivaling that headed by George
Pierce Baker of Yale, is the coun
cil's opinion of an ideal set-up.
Such an organization would give
an opportunity for real training
and experience, without hamper
ing untrained student leaders with
its administrative and financial
operative problems.
The planned change would not
mean the complete end of student
participation, nor the end of such
| student groups as Sword and San
, dais or Ramshead. Under the new
set-up a student advisory board
would bo a distinct possibility.
111 a last attempt to reduce their
deficit the council decided to restore
the Spring Musical. This produc
tion, which they hope will be their
( last, is scheduled for May 31. It is
, to be in the nature of an Intimate
Revue and will feature sketches by
Dorothy Parker and George Kauf
