# Airplanes — Publicity— Nonsense!
## 
### 
Two weeks ago an editorial appeared in
this newspaper entitled "Campus Publicity
lines llev Hey." It had reference to the pub
licity given the Firemen's Mall. II was an
allerupt to express what is general campus
sentiment regarding the Hollywood t\ pe of
cheap publicity.
We take our hats oil' to yesterday's events,
however. The Firemen's Mall, army tanks for
the Military Mall, the kidnapping last year,
loudspeakers on oil company cars traversing
the Mow are simply fee IHe and rather flaccid
attempts in comparison with the (ircal Stunt
pulled yesterday at noon.
Coming out of eleven o'clock classes, stu
dents were mildly interested in a plane doing
a hit of smoke-writing in the skies. Not many
paid attention, thinking probahly it was an
advertisement for Dr. Pierce's blood-curdling
tonic, or some such product. When the writ
ing became legible enough for everyone to
interpret, it became apparent that here was
drama in the making the would-be queen
Idling the world how to spell her name, no
doubt presuming that tk" stunt might bring
in a few more shekels.
There are possible arguments against this
point of view. It may be said that the whole
thing is a private matter, that an individual
may do anything he or she pleases, and that it
is not the business of other people to .judge
what is objectionable publicity.
This argument falls down when the fact is
considered that the whole purpose of the
annual King and Queen contest is to raise
money for charity. If all budding queen can
didates are running on this assumption, why
the waste of money on a skywriting exhibition,
or paid advertising in the campus newspaper?
Why not donate this campaign money directly
into the contest, rather than for ballyhooiug
I he candidate's name?
There are not many devices left the femi
nine sex to pull for the sake of dear old
publicity. Perhaps a neat bit of parachute
jumping with the Inner Memorial Court as a
landing field might be suggested for next
year's dough-heavy candidates.
It is a bit comforting to the old-timers on
Ihe Farm to realize that once upon a time
there were only five hundred women on the
campus, that some respect was paid to dignity
and tradition, and that the Stanford campus
did not appear like a Cos Angeles prep school
student's dream of what college should be.
