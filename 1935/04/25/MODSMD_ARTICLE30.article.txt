# Make Grades More Intelligent?
## 
### 
Abolish the lettei markings of the tradi
tional grading system ol' Ihe colleges and sub
sliluU' a mure simple, a more easily and l'airlv
applied system such is the basis lor a move
under consideration on the campus of Syra
cuse I niversity back Kast.
Hacked by students and faculty, the move
aims at the abolition of "angling for marks."
It substitutes a three-grade marking system
of "passing with honor," "passing," or "fail
ing," instead of the cumbersome letter ar
rangement. It points toward the answer for
the wnrking-for-grades criticism of modern
education and the substitution of a pure desire
for knowledge.
This proposed three-grade scheme escapes
the criticism directed at either the "plus
minus" or the letter markings. II grants two
passing grades instead of one one for the
scholar wish Phi Betish leanings and one for
Ihe student on the look-out for general knowl
edge. It gets away from the high •schoolish
attitude that a student must be prodded and
hounded by a multifarious system of grades.
Stanford students, after all, pay directly for
thei.r university education. If a Hough wants
lo spend a life of ease for a quarter on the
farm, he applies to Ihe registrar for that privi
lege. The I'niversitvj however, can refuse his
company for another quarter merely by think
ing him. The proposed system provides for
that.
After all, who wants the present unfair
grading system besides the Phi Betes?
