# Down with Penny-Throwers
## 
### 
The other day, that popular idol of the
air waves, lUidv Vallee, demonstrated that he
is not only a crooner hut a man of action.
\\ hiU* leading the orchestra in an Eastern
hotel, the noise of a penny landing at his feet
disturbed the equanimity of the oblique-eyed
singer, lie turned around just as the pennv-
Ihrower shouted that Ihe penny was intended
not for Vallee himself, but rather for the
music.
The information did not pha/c our young
hero, however. With his usual poise he de
scended from the orchestra platform, singled
out the offender, and planted a good right hook
to the jaw.

! M any a performer on the campus wishes
lh;it he might have tlie pleasure of doing the
same tiling to his fellow students, during the
course of a typical Gaieties or entertainment
when the ever-present "wise guv" takes issue
with \\h;it is being presented and lets go with
i a penny.
