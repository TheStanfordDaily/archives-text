## PEACE THROUGH WATCHFUL WAITING? 
### CROMPTON. BANGS, Jr 
BOSTON, April 24.—Stresa and the League rebuke
to Germany have come and gone and war is just as
far away as ever. Instead of hatching a war the
Stresa Conference hatched another conference—this
one to be sometime next month. From thi history of
the last 15 years lhi.s is just what we ought to expect.
In post-war Europe conferences have fol
lowed each other in rapid succession and all that
happens is still another conference. But at the
same time all the "conferencing" nations have
been carefully preparing for war—just in case
the conference should fail. Some day ,M1 these war
preparations will be complete and it will be use
less to talk. That time will come when some
nation or group of nations feel it will be safer
to strike than wait.
In the present slate of armed peace in Europe it
is hopeless to talk disarmament. The only thing to do
is to try and postpone the evil day when war is bound
to break out. Just now it looks very much like this
is being done. How is it being done? Simply by
building an iron ring of alliances around Germany.
The dangers of Europe's falling into two armed
camps are great—if both sides are anywhere near the
same strength. But if one side is very much stronger
than' the other, the weaker one will think for a long
time before starting anything. Of course there is a
danger that the stronger side may want a preventive
war before its enemy gets any bigger. But we have
to take a chance on that.
In the past few months the former allies have been
gradually drawing together again. Even while the
League Council was spanking Germany last week,
various underground alliances were shaping up.
France and Russia had practically finished their
mutual assistance pact; Czecho-Slovakia and Russia
were busy with some kind of alliance; the Little En
tente countries (Rumania, Czecho-Slovakia, Yugo
slavia) were noticeably friendly and receptive to any
French, Italian, or Russian plans to squelch or inti
mate Germany, fhen France, Italy and Great Britain
apparently are closer together than they were a few
weeks ago, while Italy and France are getting along
better than for many years. Even Poland has half
heartedly chosen sides with France in the rebuke to
Germany. However, she is still the big question mark
in the iron ring around Hitler. That still makes the
chain almost complete. It may or may not stick to
gether. It is safe to say that the stronger Hitler gets
the more likely it is to hold.
There are signs that point the other way too. Poland
is still afraid to choose sides with France definitely
when Germany light next-door is bent on getting
back lost territory. Denmark is too small and too
isolated geographically to want to offend Hitler; the
same might be said of the other Scandinavian coun
tries. Japan may be waiting for Russia to become
involved in a European war before proceeding to help
herself to what Soviet territory she wants.
All these uncertainties strengthen Germany's hand.
And remember it has always been Hitler's policy to
pick on his enemies' weak points and take them by
surprise—usually by trying to drive a wedge in a
prospective alliance.
But if the Allies' armed camp can stay much
bigger than Germany's, so Hitler will realize there is
nothing to be gained by war, peace may be with us
for some time yet. The arms manufacturers will make
millions, people will the jitters, but we will slill
have peace by watchful waiting.

apparently are closer together than they were a few
weeks ago, while Italy and France are getting along
better than for many years. Even Poland has half
heartedly chosen sides with France in the rebuke to
Germany. However, she is still the big question mark
in the iron ring around Hitler. That still makes the
chain almost complete. It may or may not stick to
gether. It is safe to say that the stronger Hitler gets
the more likely it is to hold.
There are signs that point the other way too. Poland
is still afraid to choose sides with France definitely
when Germany light next-door is bent on getting
back lost territory. Denmark is too small and too
isolated geographically to want to offend Hitler; the
same might be said of the other Scandinavian coun
tries. Japan may be waiting for Russia to become
involved in a European war before proceeding to help
herself to what Soviet territory she wants.
All these uncertainties strengthen Germany's hand.
And remember it has always been Hitler's policy to
pick on his enemies' weak points and take them by
surprise—usually by trying to drive a wedge in a
prospective alliance.
But if the Allies' armed camp can stay much
bigger than Germany's, so Hitler will realize there is
nothing to be gained by war, peace may be with us
for some time yet. The arms manufacturers will make
millions, people will the jitters, but we will slill
have peace by watchful waiting.
BOSTON, April 24.—Stresa and the League rebuke
to Germany have come and gone and war is just as
far away as ever. Instead of hatching a war the
Stresa Conference hatched another conference—this
one to be sometime next month. From thi history of
the last 15 years lhi.s is just what we ought to expect.
In post-war Europe conferences have fol
lowed each other in rapid succession and all that
happens is still another conference. But at the
same time all the "conferencing" nations have
been carefully preparing for war—just in case
the conference should fail. Some day ,M1 these war
preparations will be complete and it will be use
less to talk. That time will come when some
nation or group of nations feel it will be safer
to strike than wait.
In the present slate of armed peace in Europe it
is hopeless to talk disarmament. The only thing to do
is to try and postpone the evil day when war is bound
to break out. Just now it looks very much like this
is being done. How is it being done? Simply by
building an iron ring of alliances around Germany.
The dangers of Europe's falling into two armed
camps are great—if both sides are anywhere near the
same strength. But if one side is very much stronger
than' the other, the weaker one will think for a long
time before starting anything. Of course there is a
danger that the stronger side may want a preventive
war before its enemy gets any bigger. But we have
to take a chance on that.
In the past few months the former allies have been
gradually drawing together again. Even while the
League Council was spanking Germany last week,
various underground alliances were shaping up.
France and Russia had practically finished their
mutual assistance pact; Czecho-Slovakia and Russia
were busy with some kind of alliance; the Little En
tente countries (Rumania, Czecho-Slovakia, Yugo
slavia) were noticeably friendly and receptive to any
French, Italian, or Russian plans to squelch or inti
mate Germany, fhen France, Italy and Great Britain
