# BOULDER DAM
## WITH LAWRENCE WASHINGTON 
### CEDRIC LARSON 
Geologists state that once Arizona and Nevada were
under the ocean, but finally rose up out of the sea.
The country surrounding Boulder Dam i a barren
waste, with insignificant rainfall. Through this inhos
pitable country, the turbulent Colorado River has pa
tiently cut the Grand Canyon, created the Salton
Sea and other natural phenomenal.
No creature, save a few reptilian denizens of the
desert, lives in the solitary and rocky wastes con
tiguous to the Colorado. But for the jagged masses
of volcanic rock which furnish resplendent color ef
fects and mirages, the visitor finds little to attract his
altention in the vicinity of Boulder Dam, observes
Professor Lawrence Washington.
The dam itself is of the "arch-gravity" type, in
which the water load is borne both hy gravity
and horizontal arch action. The surrounding rock
is of the hardest type, known as andesite breccia.
At the dam site, the canyon tapers in width from
970 feet at the crest to 290 at low-water level.
"The construction of Boulder Dam was unique in
that it was built up in vertical columns which varied
in size from GO feet square at the upstream face to 25
feet at the downstream face," remarks Professor
Washington. "Adjacent columns were interlocked by
a system of keys or staggered joints. The slight
shrinkage of the concrete, upon setting, opened up
cracks between the columns which were filled by
pumping in grout (cement and water) under pressure.
Thus a monolithic structure was formed."
The result is a man-made "plug" so strong as to be
practically indestructable. Beside it. even the greatest
of Iho pyramids seems small and unimportant.
'In describing a job of such magnitude it is difficult
to avoid the use of superlatives. The 115,000-hp. ver
tical hydraulic turbines, for example, of which there
will ultimately be 15, exceed in size the largest yet
manufactured, namely, the 83,000-hp. turbines for
Russia's plant r.t Dnieprostroy. Likewise, the 30-foot
penstocks, each of which will carry water to four of
the turbines, ai e the largest pipes ever built. Too big
for transportation by rail, they must be manufactured
on tlie job.
The reservoir wilt hold 30.500.0f10 acre-feet of
water when full (an acre-foot being the amount
of water that will cover one acre one foot deep).
This huge artificial lake will store the river's flow
of water for two years, and would cover the en
tire state of New York with a blanket of water a
foot deep. The hydro-electric power capacity of
Boulder Dam will be 1,835,000-hp—Niagara (United
States) furnishes 452.000 and Dnieprostroy (U.S.
S.R.) 750.000. for comparison.
The government has invested $1,700,000 in Boulder
City, a town of 5000 with all the improvements of a
modern municipality. The town will be permanent,
and tourist traffic and dam employees will keep it in
a thriving state.
In construction of such a dangerous type accidents
are inevitable, and so far about 100 fatalities have
occurred, but <10 per cent of the men engaged on con
struction are without families.
Today Boulder City thrives—nearly 30.000 visitors a
month frequent the undertaking. Many tourists make
a week-end trip of it, driving the 300 miles from Los
Angeles or the 450 miles from Ogden in a day.
