# TRAVELS OF A STANFORD ROUGH

### CRANT LEIBERT 
j At breakfast I met two gentlemen,
i one an Italian, the other an Amer
ican, both of whom had been in
Mexico for many years. The former
spoke Spanish well, but my coun
tryman could not express his sim
plest desires correctly. He would
I pronounce the words as one would
I if they were English, and when a
Mexican was unable to understand
him, he would curse and rage be
cause Spanish was not pronounced
j as English. But apart from this
! widespread American propensity, he
| was an excellent fellow: he intro
i duced me to the city's most magnifi
cent edifice—the brewery, where, in
addition to other business, I col
lected some interesting .statistics.
This brewery, the only one in
jtown, supplies the city of Hermosillo
j alone with two million bottles of
j beer a month, excluding a large
j quantity of draft beer. Now com
i puting the population at 20,000,
'which includes all possible tourists,
! we have the residents of Hermo-
I silla consuming more than 200 bot
! ties a month. And the owner in
j formed me that it is only a scarcity
! of bottles which prevents him from
increasing his output. You are
privileged to doubt these figures un
i til you come, see, and are convinced
Jof their veracity, as I was and in
no uncertain terms.
By means of English, Spanish,
j and old Indian sign language I h*vd
| a very interesting conversation
j with a charming senorita, who
i was hound for a normal school
| teachers' convention in Mexico
City. She informed me that if I
' were interested in Mexican poli
| tics I should not fail to attend a
| reception at the town hall in honor
i of (he visiting minister of *'gricul
(ure. As accurately as I could de
termine, this gentleman's business
is to travel about the republic
making speeches, in which he
f promises whatever his particular
| audience of the evening wishes.
But to promise an audience in
; Mexico, or anywhere, as far as
that goes, everything it wishes is
i no small task; in f"ct. five hours
i is the minimum time in which it
j can he accomplished. Obviously,
i now, one man couldn't keep up
j this harangue night after night, so
I the Mexican politician has in his
| retinue five trained orators, whom
! he works in relays, and he himself
| only extends a short greeting and
j a farewell.
j Moreover, and American politi
cians might profit by this example
| of the Mexican's astuteness, His five
| orators are beautiful women, dressed
| in the very latest fashion. The Mex
! icans are too polite to boo a woman
| or leave before she has finished
i.speaking, as they would otherwise
I do if the orator were a man. Since I
j was in Mexico, I had to be polite
I also and keep my seat until the re
i lay was finished. Fortunately, I was
I seated next to a girl who spoke
| English, and who was kind enough
to give me the substance of each
speech during the interlude of music
and song which followed every ti
j rade.
The formula, simple, invariable, is
j this: A hearty declamation of all
j churches and clergymen, examples
[of the evil they have done; a eulogy
| of the working man, his rights to

liberty, equality, and so many square
feet of soil; a list of benefits for the
people which the present govern
ment has effected and is going to
continue until Mexico is Utopia. And
then a mild applause, coming mostly
from the section of red-shirted
youngsters between the ages of six
and fourteen.
Thinking we might repay the
kindness of two sisters who had
taken us for a tour of the city,
two American college boys and I
decided to secure a guitar player
and love-lay crooner for a sere
nade a la Mexicano. We soon
hired two eh'ips and took our
stations before the inevitable iron
grill, which bars every Mexican
door or window. What did we
wish them to play? The only songs
we could think of were "La Cu
caracha" and "Rancho Grande,"
which they played and sang. No
response. They played them again.
Still not the slightest acknowl
edgement.
At an English-speak
ing policeman came up to vis, and
we related our plight. He was over
come with laughter, but at last
gained enough control of himself to
tell us that our repertory was the
equivalent of "Barnacle Bill the
Sailor" and "Hinky Dinky Parlez
vous," which were rather inappro
priate for a serenade. We tried a
few of hi.s suggestions, but soon re
tired in disgrace, resolving to try to
■redeem ourselves another time.
