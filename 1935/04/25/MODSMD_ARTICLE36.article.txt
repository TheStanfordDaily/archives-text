# CAMPUS OPINION
## SOCIAL SNOBBERY 
### 
i The Editor, Sir:
Sweet charity is a good thing, and
1 1 should be among the lust to attack
I sweet charity. But to ma.sk social
| snobbery behind the thin veil of
| charity is a thing in which I don't
'think Stanford women should in
dulge.
The picture of airplanes flying
nbout the Stanford campus, flaunt
ing co-eds' names, on one hand; and
on the other hand the picture of all
the sororities (which goodness
knows are social snobs enough
I without having to be encouraged in
i it) scared stiff and handing together
just to keep someone else out at all
| costs ($4OO more than Ihey had to
pay) are disgusting pictures. And to
say that it was all done in the name
!of sweet charity is to make it even
more disgusting.
I know of nothing more encourag
' ing to hypocrisy and class snobbery
I than the masked ball queen con
tost. (The poor kings don't count.)
