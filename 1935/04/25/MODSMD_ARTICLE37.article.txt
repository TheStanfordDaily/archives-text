I "SMIRT." hy Branch Cabell. Mc-
Bridc and Co. $2.50. At the Cellar
Book Counter.
"Not since 'Alice in Wonderland*
has any writer attempted to novel-
I ize the story of a dieam," states
| Branch Cabell iui "Smirt," an urbane
I nightmare which deals, not with a
j sexless child, bait with a sophisti-
I cated, bon-vivant author.
"Smirt" is the tale of a ' Peripatetic
Episcopalian," who .suddenly finds
j himself in a world where time and
j space have no limitations; where the
I greatest improbabilities seem utterly
i probable; where it seems not at all
strange to discuss with God the ad-
J visability of writing another book,
jsir.ee the first was so successful;
J where it is most plausible to en
: counter all the members of that
| famed family of mythology, and it
lis not disconcerting to watch the
i Lords of the Universe blandly pull
' the strings as they drink beer and
! eat bandrakes, those strings which
result in—Wealthy Clubman Killed
I

I in Accident—Senate Quizzes Mellon
| — Tornado Strikes Midwest — and
I Two Slain in Love Nest.
"Smirt" is undoubtedly one of
Cabell's most delightful rogues,
I blending his vaunted urbanity and
I extreme self-love with an indubi
j table sentimentality. His one fault
I lies in his cynical inability to dis
' tingui. c h between truth and imagi
' nation, where his own talents and
! abilities are at stake.
