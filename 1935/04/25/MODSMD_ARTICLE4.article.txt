# Ask Amending Of Constitution
## Vote on Ballot System, Sponsor Appointing 
### 
Two proposed changes in the A.S.
; S.U. constitution will be voted upon
| by the student body Tuesday at the
Law iteps. One concerns the sub
stitution of the plurality ballot
system for the preferential system
now used in A.S.S.U. elections. The
; other pertains to the removal of the
I clause regarding the appointment
j of women sponsors from the A.S.S.U.
i constitution to the Women's Con
j ference by-laws.
I The change in method of election
was suggested by a petition signed
by 153 students. No reason was ex
pressed for the move except that
there is general dissatisfaction with
the present method. With the plu
i rality system a candidate receiving
j the greatest number of votes would
i be elected.
Appointment of women sponsors
would be subject to more flexible
control if the clause pertaining to it
j were removed from the body of the
| constitution to the by-laws of Wom
! en's Conference, according to Marion
I Storey.
