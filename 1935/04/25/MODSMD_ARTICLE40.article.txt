# SATURDAY'S TRACK MEET DRAWS PICK OF STARS IN STATE
## Several Old Feuds Renewed Among 130 Entries 
### Gordon Frost 
One hundred thirty entries-—the
pick of Northern California track
men—are signed to compete in the
Pacific Athletic Association meet
here in the Stanford Stadium Satur- j
clay afternoon. When an entry list 1
is swelled to that figure, spectators (
have every reason to anticipate the
renewal of past track feuds.
Saturday's meet promises its store
of these battles. A! Blackman is en
tered against Fred Walts of U.S.F. i
in the 440-yard run. Walts is the j
man who pushed Blackman to 48
flat in the U.S.F. meet a year ago,
crossing the finish a scant two yards
behind him. This may be his last
chance to run against the Stanford
iptain; he'll be out* to score a win
if possible.
Klopstock vs. Moore
Sammy Klopstock and Tom Moore
should bo two more who will stage j
a fight to the finish. Moore nosed |
out Stanford's ace hurdler in the j
lows last week in the Big Meet, but :
Sammy has vowed that he'll even I
the score Saturday. Both are signed I
to compete in the high sticks and i
Klopstock plans to repeat his last
week's victory, though Moore thinks
diflerently. Low hurdle winner at
Berkeley, Del Fishback will not '
compete.
Ray Dean and Ed Vallejo, who
tied in the Big Meet broad jump last j
Saturday are both slated to settle I
this dispute in the coming tussle. In ;
the 220-yard run A1 Blackman, Elmo
Ferrari, Les Hables, and Jim Helmer
loom as most likely winners. Fer- j
rari, who has a reputation for being j
one of the finest sprinters oix, the j
coast, is referred to as "the man who
almost beat Anderson."
Hables To Compete
Les Hables, Stanford's "hard luck j
kid" of two years ago, should give )
; ny of'these men some worry if he j
is in shape. When competing for the j
Cards in 1933, Les was dogged by an i
evil spirit that kept him laid up with i
one illness after another. John Dow- i
dakin, winner of the 220 in the Stan
ford-California frosh meet of last j
Friday, is given a chance to show |
the way, although his competition is j
strong.
In the shot put John Lyman will I
match throws with Dave Meek of i
California, Dick Levy and Jim Bey- j
nolds of Stanford. Johnny Mottram
is without great competition in the
j .ivelin.
Olympic Club is probable winner |
of the meet since the winged "O" :
team is the only squad to possess I
any strength in freak events; six- |
mile run, hammer throw, 56-pound I
weight throw, and hop, step, and I
jump.
