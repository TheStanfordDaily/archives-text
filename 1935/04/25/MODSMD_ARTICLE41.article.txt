# Thornhill Begins Grid Routine Workouts For Spring-Stricken Squad
## 
### 
Although his gridiron candidates i
are noticeably stricken with spring
fever and not overly ambitious, Tiny
Thornhill this week is beginning to
see some signs of a Cardinal foot
ball team as it will line up next j
September.
Practice New Plays
The three-ring circus of spring j
sporting activity has narrowed j
down to track and football now, and J
nearly all of Tiny's potential first !
string workers are now out in foot- i
ball togs, half-heartedly attempting j
to master many new formations and i
more new plays.
Yesterday's workout was one j
round of routine after another as the j
backs and ends devoted more than j
an hour to passing plays while the |
line took itself up to one end of the j
field to spend the afternoon blocking j
and tackling with a sawdust dummy i
as opponent. j
Scrimmage Tomorrow
The squad will hold a lengthy
scrimmage again tomorrow in an
other attempt to test the various
new Thornhill formations. Bones
Hamilton, practicing this week for
the first time since he wrenched his ;
shoulder in the Rose Bowl game, will
join the potential first string in the '
scrimmage.
