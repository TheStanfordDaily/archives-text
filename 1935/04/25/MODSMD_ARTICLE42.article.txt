NIMMO FINALLY
GETTING SET

| Chuck Nimmo has been worry
ing the followers of Stanford track.
They can't lorget the Big Meet last
year when the Stanford sophomore
ran away from California's Bob Raf
tery in a 4:22 mile and came back
later with a brilliant half-mile, just
losing by a foot or so at the tape.
Last Saturday Nimmo ran a disap
pointing third in the mile, and failed
to get in the money in the half,
(fence the 1.57.1 half mile which
Chuck ran without competition
last Tuesday comes as real good
news. It means that the distance
ace is approaching his last year's
form, which resulted in a 4:1!) mile
in the N.C.A.A. meet last June.
Afternoon labs have prevented
Chuck from coming along faster this
year. Instead of working out with
the squad at the usual 4 o'clock,
Nimmo puts in another hour or so
hanging over the test tubes and the
reagents.
Last Saturday morning before the
Big Moet, instead of taking the ex
pected relaxation, Chuck had a busy
session with the elements and the
compounds in the quant lab. He fin
ished up just in time to rush over
to the Union for lunch. The busses
were all set to leave when he got
there, so Chuck grabbed some bread,
stuck some sugar cubes in his pocket,
and called it a meal.

A YARN ABOUT
THE FROSH CAPTAIN

The metropolitan papers are al
ready on the trail of Captain Edson
Burrows, frosh squad leader and one
of the most promising distance men
that has come to Stanford within the
past few years. They tell the story
of the two-mile Burrows ran against
the varsity, in the middle of which
he took time out to put on a sweat
shirt, caught up with the leader, and
went on to win.
A better yarn about the frosh
ace originated at the Stanford
frosh-S.F. All-Stars meet this
spring. Burrows had already won
the mile and was in the first lap
of the half. One of the opposing
runners eased by, saying to Bur
rows with a sneer, of course, "Too
had. Burrows." But Ed didn't fold,
as the prep hoped, and had the
satisfaction of sweeping by the
other fellow on the stretch and
winning in 2:01, or thereabouts.
After the race the surprised S.F.
runner came around to Burrows.
"Gee! Pretty fast time," he said, be
tween puffs. "Must be your best, I
guess." But instead of getting any
consolation the disappointed prep
had to swallow Burrow's reply:
"First time I ever ran it."
