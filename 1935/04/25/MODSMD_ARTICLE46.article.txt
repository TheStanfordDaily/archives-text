# ARIZONA WILDCATS DEFEAT CARD FOUR BY SCORE OF 10-0
## Weakened Stanford Poloists Lose Second Game 
### 
A miracle failed to intervene yes- !
terday as Stanford's weakened polo- !
ists bowed to the flashy University
of Arizona quartet 10 to 0 in the j
second of their three-game series.
Carl Beal, Indian regular reported j
out, showed up to play a brilliant !
game but his presence was not ,
enough to swing the tide of victory, i
Captain Bill Rogers played his j
usual top-notch game at No. 2 for j
the Cards and though he failed to j
put the willow through the goal- j
posts, he was a tower of strength j
in the Stanford line-up. Bill Ene- i
mark at No. 1 and Jim Henderson !
at back for the redshirts both turned I
in creditable performances, though '
they were often outsmarted by their
more experienced Wildcat oppon
ents.
The absence of Bob Fullerton and
Russ Rasmussen ruined the team
work of the redshirts who seemed
unable to get under way. Lack of
experience in playing was probably
responsible for the defeat of Lieut.
H. Y. Grubbs' men.
The visiting Arizonans amply up
held their reputation as the class*)!'
intercollegiate polo in the West.
From all reports the present Ari- j
zona aggregation is the greatest of
the long series of .classy outfits that I
have come up here from Tuscon. [
Gregory Hathaway, Wildcat No. 1,
was high point man for the hard
riding visitors. He accounted for |
four goals during the afternoon's J
festivities. Jim Curtis and Jack Bud- j
long each tallied three times. The j
Tuscon men revealed as smooth and !
powerful a quartet as has ever been '
seen here.
A third and final contest between |
the two outfits will be played to- i
morrow afternoon on the highway j
field beginning at 3:30 o'clock. The I
series, before the unexpected weak- i
ening of the powerful Stanford I
squad, had given promise of a close j
fight for the mythical Far West in- |
tercollegiate championship. If the j
Arizonans win tomorrow, as they j
have every intention of doing, they j
will sweep the total five-game series. !

A miracle failed to intervene yes- !
terday as Stanford's weakened polo- !
ists bowed to the flashy University
of Arizona quartet 10 to 0 in the j
second of their three-game series.
Carl Beal, Indian regular reported j
out, showed up to play a brilliant !
game but his presence was not ,
enough to swing the tide of victory, i
Captain Bill Rogers played his j
usual top-notch game at No. 2 for j
the Cards and though he failed to j
put the willow through the goal- j
posts, he was a tower of strength j
in the Stanford line-up. Bill Ene- i
mark at No. 1 and Jim Henderson !
at back for the redshirts both turned I
in creditable performances, though '
they were often outsmarted by their
more experienced Wildcat oppon
ents.
The absence of Bob Fullerton and
Russ Rasmussen ruined the team
work of the redshirts who seemed
unable to get under way. Lack of
experience in playing was probably
responsible for the defeat of Lieut.
H. Y. Grubbs' men.
The visiting Arizonans amply up
held their reputation as the class*)!'
intercollegiate polo in the West.
From all reports the present Ari- j
zona aggregation is the greatest of
the long series of .classy outfits that I
have come up here from Tuscon. [
Gregory Hathaway, Wildcat No. 1,
was high point man for the hard
riding visitors. He accounted for |
four goals during the afternoon's J
festivities. Jim Curtis and Jack Bud- j
long each tallied three times. The j
Tuscon men revealed as smooth and !
powerful a quartet as has ever been '
seen here.
A third and final contest between |
the two outfits will be played to- i
morrow afternoon on the highway j
field beginning at 3:30 o'clock. The I
series, before the unexpected weak- i
ening of the powerful Stanford I
squad, had given promise of a close j
fight for the mythical Far West in- |
tercollegiate championship. If the j
Arizonans win tomorrow, as they j
have every intention of doing, they j
