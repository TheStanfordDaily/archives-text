# YEARLING BASEBALL SQUAD WINS EIGHT, DROPS FIVE TILTS DURING 1935 SEASON
## 
### 
Losing the fhird game of the 1935
"little s>- : es" and thereby the series
to the Bear frosh at Berkeley on
Saturday, Coach Ernie Nevers'
Stanford freshman nine completed
;i rather mediocre season of base
ball. The Cards boasted of a record
of three more games won than lost
in a schedule of 13 contests.
The high spot of the season was
during the Easter vacation when the
frosh played three games, gaining
three victories. San Mateo J.C., Se
quoia High School, and Mountain
View High School were the victims
of the Indian attack.
The annual series with California
went to three games and the Cards
appeared to have a good chance of
winning the first "little series" which
would have gone to Stanford in
seven years, but California pitching

was too much for the Indian batters,
and the final game resulted in a
Bear victory. Spike Furman, Glenn
Hamilton, and Dick Hanna handled
the pitching assignments for the
Card frosh during the season.
