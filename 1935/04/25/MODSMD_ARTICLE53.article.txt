# Eisner Urges Charity Drive Support Today
## 
### Irvin Jorgensen 
Beginning in earnest today is the
direct appeal to students for funds
to support the Stanford Convalescent
Home. Men speakers will visit wom
en's eating groups, while 37 women
speakers go to men's eating groups
at noon and dinner-time.
Pointing out that every single
contribution helps—no matter how
small — Willard Eisner, general
chairman of the drive, urges the
students to contribute, saying:
"We arc not expecting Stanford
itcs to give to the Home because
it is a charity, but because it is a
pleasure to help support such a
worthwhile institution.
"Committeemen who have gone
out to see the Home have formed a
deep and earnest conviction that any
work they do is fun, and that all the
tun they get is pure, economic
profit.
"The effect that this great institu
tion has on our committeemen we
would like to transmit, if possible, to
the students as a whole. It is for
this reason that we are urging all
.students to take advantage of the op
portunity to inspect the Home today.
