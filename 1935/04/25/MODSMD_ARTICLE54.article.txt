WHAT. NO YEEES?
And the Big Meet was at Berkeley.
And the Indians fought a valiant
fight, and lost. And the Bears, who j
had won, went wild, and shouted, j
and screamed, and cheered. And
there were no yells for Stanford.
And my, oh my, oh my. What is '
become of Stanford spirit? And is
Stanford spirit dead? And someone
| should be given ten lashes on the j
bare back. And then Stanford will
be virile once again.
We have spoken to Indians who J
| believe that. There are some who j
think that because Stanford had no J
organized insanity at the Big Meet i
at Berkeley, because Stanford men \
and women did not return the Cali- • r
• i'ornia attack—yell for yell, that the |
Farm's Cardinal escutcheon has been
dragged through the mire of col- j
legiate disgrace. And that the hymn
was not sung? That is an unspeak- ;
! able crime, bordering on the down- j'
; right sinful.
i
And the yell-leader—who had the j
good sense not to arrange laryngeal I
acrobatics for the Big Meet — has ,
; been put on the spot, made to ex
plain his conduct before the Ex
Committee. As the "investigation" |
i proved the yell leader was following
more closely on Stanford tradition i
than many of his righteous accusers, j
Fortunately, the Big Meet is not ;
supposed to be a second Big Game, j
In recent years Big Meets have not j
been the occasion of tumultous yell- ;
, ing and gibbering. And it is best |
that they are not made so.
Because the University of Cali
fornia — flushed with victory and I
money—chooses to dedicate its new !
j athletic field with i - oar and battle |
cry, is no very good reason that
Stanford must follow suit. Because J
Berkeleyites choose to yell their i
j heads off for school, for alumni, and j
for legislature, that does not mean
that Stanford must join hands in
Hollywoodizing inter-collegiate ath
i letics.
Despite the pressure of old grads, j
movies, and prep schools, inter- ,
collegiate athletics are gradually be-
I ing more sensibly conducted. De- i
pression has cut the size of the S.C. j
band, and cut into the tremendous j
gridiron gate receipts. Students are j
going to athletic contests less often j
than formerly, and enjoying them- ,
selves more when they do go. The
past football season seemed to in
dicate that there is better sports- j
manship displayed whan games are I
I smaller, and are accompanied by less j
riot and mayhem. There is yet some |
hope that athletics will once more
be engaged in for the love of sport, j
I and not as a sort of big business j
competition.
In 193.) A.D. Stanford students are
adopting a saner attitude toward
their college sports. Three cheers
for the Stanford yell-leader.
