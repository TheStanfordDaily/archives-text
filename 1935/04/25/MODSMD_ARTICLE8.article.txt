# Show Offered On Labor Day
## Workers Are Entertained At Convalescent Home 
### 
While hungry workers consume
the food to be provided them at the
Convalescent Home on Labor Day,
next Wednesday, a program of en
tertainment will be presented by
Dick Stark, master of ceremonies.
Provided "Doodles" Weaver can
recover from the effects of his
death-struggle with "I'll Be Hard
To Handle" Walton in the king
contest, he will present the
machination from his brain, a skit
dealing with the adventures of one
"Yippy."
Another attraction will be a group
of banjo and guitar numbers by Don
Geggie and Ernie Heckscher. Two
Alpha Phis, Anne Bartlett and
Elizabeth Rhodes will also play a
group of popular piano numbers.
Jim Copp has also consented to do
one of his inimitable skits something
on the order of the one he did for
the Big Game Gaieties last fall.
This list of attractions will be
supplemented before the big day, ac
cording to Copp, chairman of the
entertainment committee. Serving
with him in making the arrange
ments are Harriet Kilby, Gordon
Stecdman, Dick Stark, and George
Fuller.
