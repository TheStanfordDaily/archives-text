| SS. TRAINS EAST TO BE
I COMPLETELY AIR-CONDmGNED
Going East this summer? If you travel Southern Pacific
you'll enjoy a luxury that even the homes of millionaires
do not have. Our five finest trains to the East will be AIR
COOLED and AIR-CONDITIONED from stem to stern-
Pullmans, tourist sleeping cars, rcclining chair cars, coaches,
dining cars, club and observation cars—every single car! No
matter what the weather may be—inside an air-conditioned
car the air is always cool and clean, free of dust and dirt.
Right now most of the cars arc air-conditioned on the
Overland Limited and Pacific Limited (San Francisco - Chi
cago), Sunset Limited (Los Angeles-New Orleans), Golden
State Limited (Los Angeles-Chicago) and Cascade (San Fran
cisco-Portland). BY MAY 15 all cars on each of these five
trains will have the new improvement.
AIR-CONDITIONED CARS ON LOCAL TRAINS, TOO!
You can travel in air-cooled comfort to many points on the
Pacific Coast, too; for some of our trains between San Fran
cisco, Los Angeles and Portland have air-conditioned cars.
LOW FARES EAST begin MAY 15 .

HOW TO SEE TWICE AS MUCH
Our leading trains approach the East through four entirely
different parts of the country. Instead of showing you just
one of these regions on your trip East and back, Southern
Pacific can show you two! Go East on one Southern Pacific
route and return on a different one. You'll see twice as much
of the country and make a roundtrip that's really round.
MEXICO
Very low fares to Mexico City, good one way via our \T est
Coast Route through Mazatlan and Guadalajara, one way via
the National Railways of Mexico and LI Paso. Air-condi
tioned cars to Mexico City on both routes. You can easily visit
Mexico City in a two weeks' vacation. Ask agent for details.
