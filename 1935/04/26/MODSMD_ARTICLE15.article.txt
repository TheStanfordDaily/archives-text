# 'Home' Kiddies Thrill at Being Part of Stan ford
## 
### 
Convalescent Home children eel a bigger (brill out of being connected
with Stanford University than the collcgc students do themselves. That
is the opinion of Mrs. Margaret Atwood, head of the Home.
Besides the great pleasure and inspiration they get when they realize
what Ihc collcgc students do for them during the annual Convalescent

Home Drive, and especially when ,
they sec the impossible — college
students working, on Labor Day— i
1 the children sing Stanford songs, j
! listen over the radio to Stanford i
football games, • and hear with de
light Ihc echoes of the yells when
there are games in the stadium.
The Chi Omega Easter egg hunt,
where the picture shown here was
taken, is one of the contacts that the
j children have with Stanford. Betty
Joe, the girl shown, stoutly affirms
that her hair is "naturally" curly.
After being in the Home for many
j months, Betty Joe is one of the more
I fortunate Convalescent Home chil—
| drcn who are in the "runabout"
'stage, and will soon be returned to 1
I her father and mother completely
J normal and healthy.
The "runabout" children get the
i most fun out of the Easter egg hunt,
' but the bed patients sec that the
i spoils uf the war are equally di-
I vided. One child boasted: "I found
the most eggs but the nurses made
i tne split 'em with the other kids." j
