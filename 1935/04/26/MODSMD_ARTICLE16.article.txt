# EX COMMITTEE WILL CONSIDER DRAMA CHANGE
## New Theater Necessitates Difference in System, Wilbur States 
### Henry Brill 
Although members of Dramatic
Council feel themselves practically
non-existent after Wednesday's dis
solving resolution, before the bit
ter end actually arrives the council's
memorable and momentous action
! must receive the approval of the
i Executive Committee.
President Ray Lyman Wilbur
stated that the present situation
i has long been developing and
that the present outburst of the
council is not quite a surprise to
I him. "A transfer from the ama-
I teur to the professional approach
! becomes necessary with the new
\ enlarged facilities which we will
have next ye^x.
' "The Dramatic Council, which has
1 established a fine record at the Uni
j versity, is to be congratulated for its
farsightedness in looking ahead and
! planning for the future welfare of
j dramatics."
Will Be Faculty Activity
| Dr. Wilbur added that if the ad
â–  ministration takes over the control
: of dramatics, a complete turn-about
j will take place, for "the student ac
tivity interest with faculty partici
pation will lie reversed and become
'a faculty activity with student par-
J iicipation." As to future plans, Dr.
Wilbur stated that the problem will
; have to be worked out soon with
| those interests and parties which arc
I involved.
A.S.S.U. President Marvie Kahn
I unofficially approved the council's
j action. "There's unquestionably a
i definite need for reorganization and
i a definite need of a change in the
I functions and duties of both Ihe
; dramatic manager and the council,"
I he said.
Too Much Overhead
"The student members of the
j council have to bear too much of an
; unnecessary overhead in the pay-
I menl of faculty arid student salaries
I and operative expenses. However,
i any new plan should bo so organ
ized that it won't bar participation
I in dramatic activity by those stu
; dents not enrolled in dramatics
; classes."
i The Council's action in requesting
i the University to take over control
jof dramatics is the result of their
; realization that a body of students
has grown up in the University
which is .seeking genuine training
and experience iri drama.
J The present set-up is satisfactory
. for the milder forms of student.
I participation, but precludes any real
j progress or achievement.
