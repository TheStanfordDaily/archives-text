# Soaring Silver Barely Meets Treasury Offer
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 25 (/P).
â€”Soaring silver prices barely
squeezed beneath the Treas
ury's day-old offer for newly
mined metal today, and in
formed officials promptly fore
saw new boosts toward the
statutory goal of $1.29 an ounce.
A definite commitment that,
government price advances
would keep a stqp ahead of
world levels was read by even
his own subordinates into Sec
retary Morgenthau's statement
to newsmen that the Treasury
would continue to buy until
silver's market price was $1.29
or government stocks equalled
one-third the gold supply.
Along with this statement
went, a definite understanding
the Treasury was on an hour
to-hour basis in directing its
silver policy. A price boost to
morrow is not impossible.
