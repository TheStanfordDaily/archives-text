# LECTURER HITS CLASS CONFLICT
## Professor Becker Finishes 'Progress' Series 
### Cedric Larson 
"This discordant system" breed
ing class conflict and disastrous wars,
was the indictment of the present
economic structure of western civi
lization given last night by Pro
fessor Carl L. Becker, Cornell his
torian, in his third and concluding
lecture, "Instruments of Precision,"
in the 1935 West Memorial scries on
"Progress and Power."
Dating from the time of the Cru
sades nearly a millenium ago, the
fourth and final epoch in the history
of man, according to the professor's
division, was cradled and nurtured
in Europe, until in the 20th century
a material civilization of a thousand
complexities was erected.
Stresses Social I^ag
The lag between social progress
and technical development, was
stressed by the historian. With a
piethora of wealth, food, and serv
ices, nations are gripped by de
pression, machines stand idle while
millions starve. The genius of the
past has been directed chiefly in
channels of creating instruments of
precision, but distribution of aug
mented produce is left to chance.
The task now faced by man is to
work out a more equitable distribu
tion of the great surpluses the mod
ern engineering genius of man has
created.
Can Be No Profits
"There can be neither public nor
private benefit in employing self
sufficing or automatic machines to
make things to sell for private profit,
since a self-sufficing machine can
neither buy the things it makes, nor
in the absence of man-power and
wages, distribute them for consump
tion to the additional population,"
the professor said in condemning the
modern capitalistic price-system.
Man's notable achievement of the
fourth epoch has been his growing
comprehension of the universe in
which he lives, and the smallness
and relative unimportance of his own
mundane existence, was Professor
Becker's final estimate of the "doc
trine of progress."
