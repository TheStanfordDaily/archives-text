# Cards Play Host In P. A. A. Track Meet Tomorrow
## Indians, O.C. To Compete For Honors; 175 Men Will Participate 
### Warren Breed 
Stanford stadium will see its 1935
track debut tomorrow afternoon
| when 175 amateurs from all over
j Central California compete in the
j annual P.A.A. meet.
I Coach Dink Templeton has entered
j his full squad and expects to fight it
; out with Charlie Hunter's Olympic
Club for top team honors. The Club
is strong in the four "freak" events,
j Late entries yesterday came in
from Sacramento and Modesto Jun
ior Colleges, and 20 more men were
expected from San Mateo J.C. A doz
en .unattached entries from U.C. are
entered, as are several of the out
standing freshman performers and
aji S.F.U. team.
Templcton's chief concern is not
directly with the meet tomorrow,
but with the performances of his
| stars in preparation for the Trojan
meet a week hence.
He worked his men hard yester
day afternoon in practice, on the
theory that, a hard workout this
week will show up with good per
i formances against the S.C. team. His
; men will take only a light workout
today.
Smith Looks Good
Humbert Smith, who was injured
! ten dnys ago and is still limping,
was out yesterday and cleared the
. bar better than he has since the
I sprain. His right ankle is still band-
I aged and does not permit the best
; jumping.
i The mile still looms as one of the
I best races of the'day. Norm Bright,
i Warren Dixon, Chuck Nimmo, Bob
| Heavey, Ed Burrows, Johnny Wall,
j and Rusty March are all probable
| starters. Heavey will be out to take
' revenge over Dixon for his defeat in
1 the Big Meet mile last Saturday.
Another attempt at revenge will
he in the high hurdles, where Tom
' Moore of Cal will meet Stanford's
! Sammy Klops'tock.
! In the sprints Le.s Hable, the Card
