Today is the big day. Starting Ibis alter- j
noon with the Water Carnival, and ending in
the smaller hours with the annual Masque |
bull, the campus again lives through the
most colorful day of the year.
Colorfully decorated canoes, wider sports
of many varieties, the King and Queen rid
ing the mighty waves of the take in the royal
barge, are all a part of the pageant.
All the whispers of social snobbery as op
posed to publicity, of praise or censure for i
the contest itself, have their final blast this
morning in these columns. Perhaps all litis
t\pe of thing is necessary to insure the sue- .
cess of the event. However, il will be forgot- i
ten by tonight, when the King and Queen go j
through their coronation ceremonies, and the
usual weird assortment of costumes enter the
pavilion to the hissing of the Houghs lined up i
outside the entrance.
II is all in the spirit of good old spring- !
lime weather; the thing to do is to attend the j
Water Carnival this afternoon, dig up a date 1
and some sort of costume and have one last j
tling before Hindquarters come along, with the '
thought that the price of the bid is added
onto the donations for the Convalescent Home i
drive.
