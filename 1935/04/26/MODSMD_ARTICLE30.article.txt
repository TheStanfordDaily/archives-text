# Our Lobbying Legislators
## 
### 
A Sim Francisco newspaper yesterday pre- ;
senled in its front page news columns an il- 1
luminating picture of how legislation goes on
at Sacramento, center of California's law
making machinery.
Kntitled, "Bottle Is C.hicf Aid to Lobbyists," J
from (he alleged truth as written in Ibis ar
ticle it must be concluded that the typical
state senator and representative is by -no .
means a paragon of virtue.. In fact, this pic
lure has the poor politician sitting in a hotel >
room near the capitol, with a whisky I:iss in
each hand, a lobbyist at each elbow, and a
few local politicians from the "home town"
hanging around the room waiting for the
gravy to drip.
Many stories concerning the intellectual
abilities of our stale legislators have made
the rounds since the beginning of the present
session. A new system of voting by lights was
inaugurated, to speed up the recording of
voles. The lights Hash green or red, to denote
a yes vole or a no vote. The lirst time the
newly installed lights were installed on the ,
door, when the green light first Hashed to j
record a vote, il is said that a number of the
esteemed representatives of the people rushed
out onto the floor of the chambers in lighting
posture.
Such antics represent exactly the type of
program carried out by these congressmen
and senators. II is well known that the in
tense lobbying which goes on in Sacramento
makes any work done in the sessions prac
tically worthless. All the main legislation is
carried on in the committee rooms, and it
is ;i sale bet lo say that more legislation is
discussed in the Senator Motel than in the
Capitol building.
Despite all these discouraging evidences
of corrupt practice and waste of time, there i
are sincere and well-equipped men in Ihc leg
islature. Thev are such a small number,
however, that their influence on the rest is
almost nil.
It is a wise time for the graduating college
student to seriously think of entering politics, '
and attempting lo help clean up an era of
lobbying and bungling which is only re pre- :
senled in small degree in this slate. All over
the country, the situation is analogous. It is
left for a new generation lo clean up the mess
which an older group of men cannot seem lo
conquer.
