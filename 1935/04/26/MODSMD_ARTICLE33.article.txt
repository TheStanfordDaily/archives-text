### CEDRIC LARSON 
WITII LAWRENCE WASHINGTON
The United States government hopes to have this
$165,000,000 Boulder Dam pay for itself by 1985, that is
to say, within a 50-year period. Total gross revenue
from sale of power in the half-century period is esti
mated at $361,000,000, much of which will bo sold to the
city of Los Angeles.
This will leave a surplus of nearly the amount of ihe
original investment, of which United States takes 62 per
cent, and Arizona and Nevada 19 per cent each. Definite
proportions of the federal surplus will go to flood con
trol or as otherwise designated by Congress within
the Colorado River basin.
Professor Washington points out that each year 4,330
million kilowatt-hours of electrical energy will be avail"
able for consumption from this dam. In September of
this year the first units of power generation will go into
operation.
There are nearly 2,000,000 acres of irrigable land
below Boulder Dam reservoir, of which Arizona !vs
800,000 acres, California 1,200,000 acres and some
15.000 acres for Nevada. By means of an All-Amer
ican canal, the Imperial Valley will be benefited
enormously from (lie reservoir, as 850,000 acres can
be 'Mlded to the 522,000 acres already under irriga
tion. Much mesa-land will be cultivated as rec
lamation schemes are perfected.
Nearly 44 per cent of the irrigable lands are public,
40 per cent private, Indian 8 per cent, and entered,
state and railroad lands make up the balance. The
All-American canal to the Imperial Valley will be
about 80 miles long, and another to the Coachella
Valley 130 miles long. Portions of these huge irrigation
canals, which will make the desert country literally
blossom as the rose, will be lined with concrete.
The gigantic Imperial Irrigation District will require
about 1.700 miles of canals and laterals. In the new
areas which can be cultivated, such crops as alfalfa,
cantaloupes, lettuce, small fruit, barley, and corn will
thrive. In the rich Imperial and Coachella Valleys, the
growing season is practically 365 days a year, and the
per-acre yield of crops is prolific. Already 30,000 car
loads of cantaloupes and lettuce are shipped out of
Imperial Valley each season.
There are other valleys, such as Parker and Gila
Valleys, which benefit immensely from the Boulder
Dam project. Hundreds of jobs will be created in this
new farmland and in irrigation upkeep.
Professor Washington believes that the future of
the Southwest is an alluring one with such latent
possibilities. The Southwest is a subtropical re
gion in which nearly all types of crops flourish.
Development will he allowed to proceed only at
an orderly rate commensurate with
control.
Boulder Dam, planned and executed to a large
extent under government agencies, proves the fallacy
of arguments that such enterprises do not have to be
in private hands to flourish. It is not only one of the
greatest engineering feats in the history of the world,
but milestones the hastening trend of successful and
intelligent federal supervision in the economic devel
opment of the nation.

of arguments that such enterprises do not have to be

WITII LAWRENCE WASHINGTON
The United States government hopes to have this
$165,000,000 Boulder Dam pay for itself by 1985, that is
to say, within a 50-year period. Total gross revenue
from sale of power in the half-century period is esti
mated at $361,000,000, much of which will bo sold to the
city of Los Angeles.
This will leave a surplus of nearly the amount of ihe
original investment, of which United States takes 62 per
cent, and Arizona and Nevada 19 per cent each. Definite
proportions of the federal surplus will go to flood con
trol or as otherwise designated by Congress within
the Colorado River basin.
Professor Washington points out that each year 4,330
million kilowatt-hours of electrical energy will be avail"
able for consumption from this dam. In September of
this year the first units of power generation will go into
operation.
There are nearly 2,000,000 acres of irrigable land
below Boulder Dam reservoir, of which Arizona !vs
800,000 acres, California 1,200,000 acres and some
15.000 acres for Nevada. By means of an All-Amer
ican canal, the Imperial Valley will be benefited
enormously from (lie reservoir, as 850,000 acres can
be 'Mlded to the 522,000 acres already under irriga
tion. Much mesa-land will be cultivated as rec
lamation schemes are perfected.
Nearly 44 per cent of the irrigable lands are public,
40 per cent private, Indian 8 per cent, and entered,
state and railroad lands make up the balance. The
All-American canal to the Imperial Valley will be
about 80 miles long, and another to the Coachella
Valley 130 miles long. Portions of these huge irrigation
canals, which will make the desert country literally
blossom as the rose, will be lined with concrete.
The gigantic Imperial Irrigation District will require
about 1.700 miles of canals and laterals. In the new
areas which can be cultivated, such crops as alfalfa,
cantaloupes, lettuce, small fruit, barley, and corn will
thrive. In the rich Imperial and Coachella Valleys, the
growing season is practically 365 days a year, and the
per-acre yield of crops is prolific. Already 30,000 car
loads of cantaloupes and lettuce are shipped out of
Imperial Valley each season.
There are other valleys, such as Parker and Gila
Valleys, which benefit immensely from the Boulder
Dam project. Hundreds of jobs will be created in this
new farmland and in irrigation upkeep.
Professor Washington believes that the future of
the Southwest is an alluring one with such latent
possibilities. The Southwest is a subtropical re
gion in which nearly all types of crops flourish.
Development will he allowed to proceed only at
an orderly rate commensurate with
control.
