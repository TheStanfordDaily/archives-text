Tonight is the carnival of grut
Of laughter, gayety, and smut.
Lovely dancing, lovely stuff.

Bui all these actions prodigious
Are l-eally strictly religious.

If a lady should show up tonight in a Spanish cos

Dillingkoff did it.)
After long observation and experience, it has be
come my profound belief that the sole use of a Daily
business staff member is to rush through the editorial

all the while looking very official.
The part that the hashing force plays in turning
the heels of commerce and industry, and effecting a
jolly-up and get-together of supply and demand is
fully appreciated in Roblc, at least. In Chappie's
recent "Loveliest Girl" Contest, u certain Roble hasher,
T.M.D. by initial, received three tremendous votes.
Roble never experienced the rigors and terrors <>f
Sunday night supper until hist Sunday night, when a
"mixed group" of Chi Psi's and Alpha Delts walked
