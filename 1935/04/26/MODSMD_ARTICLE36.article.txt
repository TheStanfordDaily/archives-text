LEGALIZED GAMBLING
The Editor, Sir:
Critics of the legalized gambling
in behalf of Stanford's imported Ar
menians, which takes from those who
have and gives to those who have not
In an effort to increase total utility,
have a wrong idea of the purpose of
college education. Different people
give different reasons for coming to
college, but only one applies to all
of us. We are here to have a good
time. That is as it should be. We are
of that age. The queen contest af
fords fun for all. It is amusing and
therefore it is good.
We achieve our good times in dif
ferent ways. Some people get the
most pleasure from social snobbery.
It is their way and they should be
encouraged. Some like to advertise,
and the recent sky-writing was not
only good exercise for Stanford necks
—including Miss Ramming's, if it
needs it — but was amusing and
therefore good. The idea of the ad
vertising lines in the Daily was es
sentially clever, though some of them
bordered on a currently discredited
form of humor. The answering ad
vertisement was even more clever—
it amused many college students in
search of that good time which is our
goal.
A few students, strangely deluded
by university tradition, find their
pleasure in the stimulation of pro
fessors and the joys of academic
work. They, too, I suppose, should
be encouraged. At least they afford
amusement to others.
Sincerely,
—Jim Weber
