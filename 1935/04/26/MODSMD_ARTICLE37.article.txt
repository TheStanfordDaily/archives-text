# FROM THE NEW REGIME
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
In answer to the campus opinion
and your editorial in Thursday's
Daily, it is my purpose to inform the
campus that Lbgunila Court itself
had no connection with the recent
campaign and advertisement by the
contestants lor the queen who resides
at said residence.
It is our opinion that the whole
set-up of the King and Queen con
test leads to unnecessary advertising
and methods of defeating the oppo
nent. The Row this year was "do or
die" in an attempt to defeat the
strongest candidate from the Halls
who was in no way supported finan
cially or otherwise by their organi
zation.
Furthermore, Mr. Editor, not. all
members of the new regime at Stan
ford have forgotten tradition and
dignity.
Sincerely,
â€”Sue Clarke
President, Lagunita Court
