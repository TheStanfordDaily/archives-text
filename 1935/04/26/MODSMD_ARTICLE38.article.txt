# MORE QUEEN CONTEST
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Bill Rogers based his letter which
appeared in yesterday's Daily upon
the assumption that the means do
not justify the ends. If he is right,
although the greatest philosophers
have been unable to agree upon this
point, everything connected with the
Masque Ball "Queen Contest" was
wrong. Instead of adopting a clever
means of raising money for the Con
valescent Home, Stanford should
merely have canvassed the halls and
houses—and come off with a quarter
of the sum actually raised.
According to the Daily editorial
writer, the publicity for the Ram
ming cause was nonsense, for money
was wasted on the campaign. The
greatest showmen in the world, from
P. T. Barnum to Adolf Hitler, have
known that publ'city money is sel
dom wasted money. At first, how
ever, let it be clarified that the criti

cism aimed at Miss Ramming is un
warranted, for she neither paid for,
nor in any way conducted the cam
paign.
The aerial escapade served its pur
pose. Through the enthusiasm which
it raised, more money than ever be
fore was put forth for a single can
didate. But the campaign served yet
another purpose, grand for the Con
valescent Home, fateful for Miss
Ramming. So frightened were the
Row girls at this undreamed of
threat from the Halls that they were
forced to band together. They raised
more money than ever before and
succeeded in once more placing a
Row girl upon the throne.
Thus the Ramming publicity cam
paign missed its mark, in that in the
end its candidate was defeated. But,
almost solely on account of that pub
licity campaign, nearly a thousand
dollars more than ever before will
accrue to the Home to work won
ders among its crippled inmates.
Sincerely,
—Alan Cranston
