# TAKEN TO TASK

### 
The Editor. Sir:
Am much amused at your dismay
over the "Los Angeles prep" tactics
of the royal election. Your stand on
the queenly frivolities should irk. but
1 irk hard, and it is so hot today
anyway. Can only smile and add my
little bit of foolishness.
Why all the froth, Dippy, over the
Ramming group's antics? They
were fun to watch, and I think a few
of us light-minded souls even dared
to enjoy a smile and see some humor
in them. (I don't come from L.A.,
Hollywood, or junior college, and I
didn't even vote.) A little smoke in
the sky might be a bit unorthodox
and original for Stanfordites — but
give the girl credit for # daring.
And certainly these unique methods
added a lot to the interest in the
contest —did you not note the record
crowd at the polls, and the record
sum it shelled out? 76,386 more little
pennies to help the little kiddies than
ever before! Not bad—wish I were a
little kiddie.
Foolishly I thought 1 his record was
the result ol the Ramming campaign
technique, and the frightened soro
rity counterattack it provoked. But
smilingly do I perish this thought
upon learning from your stern edi
torial that "the whole purpose of
the annual King and Queen contest
is to raise money for charity." So,
in deference to you, I bow (with a
smile) and attribute the record to an
increase of charity here on the Farm,
Sweet charity! What names are done
in thy deeds!
And Dippy, why the lack of spleen
over the sorority coalition. Our old
Encina pool-room crowd would have
called that "dirty pool." When old
Abe Mellinkoff ran you, you would
have given the Greekettes a wee bit
of ribbing on that incident. You
might have even used it to argue
that all was not serene and harmo
nious on the Hellene—Pan-Hellene
front. But I guess your lack of in
terest in that little ganging just goes
to show we have no female problem
here at Stanford.
But all in all, Dippy, smile and
admit it was a good contest and
achieved results. Don't take things
so seriously—dignity is not the only
virtue. And if you must pan some
bdoy or something, get after the
election committee for commercially
tallying the votes in dollars and cents
(gently, though, and with a smile);
or get after the female element for
dropping hairpins on the Quad and
messing things up.

The Editor. Sir:
Am much amused at your dismay
over the "Los Angeles prep" tactics
of the royal election. Your stand on
the queenly frivolities should irk. but
1 irk hard, and it is so hot today
anyway. Can only smile and add my
little bit of foolishness.
Why all the froth, Dippy, over the
Ramming group's antics? They
were fun to watch, and I think a few
of us light-minded souls even dared
to enjoy a smile and see some humor
in them. (I don't come from L.A.,
Hollywood, or junior college, and I
didn't even vote.) A little smoke in
the sky might be a bit unorthodox
and original for Stanfordites — but
give the girl credit for # daring.
And certainly these unique methods
added a lot to the interest in the
contest —did you not note the record
crowd at the polls, and the record
sum it shelled out? 76,386 more little
pennies to help the little kiddies than
ever before! Not bad—wish I were a
little kiddie.
Foolishly I thought 1 his record was
the result ol the Ramming campaign
technique, and the frightened soro
rity counterattack it provoked. But
smilingly do I perish this thought
upon learning from your stern edi
torial that "the whole purpose of
the annual King and Queen contest
is to raise money for charity." So,
in deference to you, I bow (with a
smile) and attribute the record to an
increase of charity here on the Farm,
Sweet charity! What names are done
in thy deeds!
And Dippy, why the lack of spleen
over the sorority coalition. Our old
Encina pool-room crowd would have
called that "dirty pool." When old
Abe Mellinkoff ran you, you would
have given the Greekettes a wee bit
of ribbing on that incident. You
might have even used it to argue
that all was not serene and harmo
nious on the Hellene—Pan-Hellene
front. But I guess your lack of in
terest in that little ganging just goes
to show we have no female problem
here at Stanford.
But all in all, Dippy, smile and
admit it was a good contest and
achieved results. Don't take things
so seriously—dignity is not the only
virtue. And if you must pan some
bdoy or something, get after the
election committee for commercially
tallying the votes in dollars and cents
(gently, though, and with a smile);
or get after the female element for
dropping hairpins on the Quad and
messing things up.
