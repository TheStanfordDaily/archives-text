CHARITY. SNOBBERY,
The only thing that disturbed the
I peace and quiet of last night was the
sound of hammers driving large
spikes into a wild assortment of
miscellaneous rumors. And this
morning, while the near-royalty
salve their bitten bucks, half the
campus prepares to get swacked for
the sake of charity.
After tne sky-writing and other
smokes of battle have cleared away,
the most outstanding phenomenon is
$2,050 credited to the Convalescent
! Home. Next most outstanding phe
nomenon is a Campus Opinion,
burning with more or less righteous
indignation. The Masque Ball is
condemned on the ground that it
i masks nothing but "social snob
bery," encourages hypocrisy, and in
short—hides a core of rottenness be
neath a glossy coating of resurgent
altruism.
The Opinion takes a side-swipe at
cheap publicity, and closes with an
! other burst of scorn. Now no one
I feels proud of that aerial tribute to
I Stanford womanhood (least of all
Stanford womanhood in general,
and the candidate in particular).
And it will never be repeated. But
what of the Masque Ball? Does it
encourage "social snobbery"? And
j if it does, is the ball worthy of con
tinuation?
It is true that many
' pennies have dropped into ihe Con
valescent Drive till, earned on the
: wings of snobbery and vanity. It
: cannot be doubted that a large part
|of that two thousand dollars was
j contributed not because the donors
! loved the kiddies, but because they
i loved the prestige and publicity of
Masque Ball royalty. The charity
| angle but served to wheedle fond
j parents into coming through with
the money.
But that is a commendation, and
not a condemnation of the Masque
; Ball. Realizing that snobbery exists,
| realizing that vanity is one of the
| most powerful drives known to the

BOOBERY—AND SUCH
race of women—and men, the found
ers of the Masque Ball hit on a mar
velous plan. They would take this
snobbery, and put it where it would
do some real good. Better it is that
.snobbery serves to cure crippled
children than that it should run
loose—flitting in wasteful abandon
across the social landscape.
All women (and most men) will
spend more money and effort to get
their pictures in the paper and their
names before the public than thiy
will to help the worthiest of causes.
If charity can make a cut on snob
bery, that is genuine progress.
It is no more to be lamented that
the Masque Ball masks snobbery
than it is to be regretted that clothes
but serve to cloak nakedness. The
Masque Ball exploits an innate
snobbery. The Convalescent Home
benefits. Eveiybody is happy.
