j "MISSISSIPPI"
At the Stanford Theater
The Old South, set to modern mu
! sic, and Booth Tarkington's old
fashioned melodrama about the
: northerner who, losing his fiance be
' cause he won't fight a duel, becomes

a notorious bad
man of the Mis
sissippi.
As the north
erner, Bin g
Cro.sby appears
slightly more
grotesque than
usual, particu-

| larly when he sports a little mus
tache, which takes tremendously
amusing postures when Bing sings.
But give the boy credit —he can
I sing, and he makes out famously
i with "Soon" and "It's Easy To Re
member." These melodies are di
-1 rected to a new and mors radiant
Joan Bennett, who here demon
! strates definite acting ability.
However, it is W. C. Fields who
really steals the show. He seems
blessed with a Micawber hangover,
which makes for a delicious comedy
performance in a Cap'n Andy type
of role. You'll like "Mississippi," but
you'll like it chiefly for the songs
and Fields' drolleries, for its story
is unconvincing and its movement
dreadfully slow.
—H. G. Lowe
