j "MISSISSIPPI"
At the Stanford Theater
The Old South, set to modern mu
! sic, and Booth Tarkington's old
fashioned melodrama about the
: northerner who, losing his fiance be
' cause he won't fight a duel, becomes

a notorious bad
man of the Mis
sissippi.
As the north
erner, Bin g
Cro.sby appears
slightly more
grotesque than
usual, particu-

| larly when he sports a little mus
tache, which takes tremendously
amusing postures when Bing sings.
But give the boy credit —he can
I sing, and he makes out famously
i with "Soon" and "It's Easy To Re
member." These melodies are di
-1 rected to a new and mors radiant
Joan Bennett, who here demon
! strates definite acting ability.
However, it is W. C. Fields who
really steals the show. He seems
blessed with a Micawber hangover,
which makes for a delicious comedy
performance in a Cap'n Andy type
of role. You'll like "Mississippi," but
you'll like it chiefly for the songs
and Fields' drolleries, for its story
is unconvincing and its movement
dreadfully slow.
