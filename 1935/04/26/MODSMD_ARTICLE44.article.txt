# NAVY LACE
## 
### 

The CLOTHES CLOSET at 510
Waverlcy is favored by frequent
visits from Elizabeth Rhodes. We
like her to try on the latest styles
(she wears them so well). Here
she wears a new navy lace shirt
maker dress. She holds a palm
leaf straw sailor hat from the HAT
BOX, 510 Waverlcy, which com
pletes the ensemble for an im
portant date.
