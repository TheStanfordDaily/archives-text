# ACADEMIC FREEDOM
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Students who still harbor illu
sions about the inviolability of "aca
demic freedom" may find realistic
instruction in the antics of Dr. T. W.
MacQuarrie of San Jose State Col
lege.
During the boom days, the pro
nouncements of this enlightened
educator against student apathy to
the needs and deeds of our sham
bling republic were many and dour.
He even went so far as to introduce
a required cour.sc in "orientation"
into the regular curriculum in Order
that students might be "oriented" to
the problems of the commonwealth.
In the boom days it was, of course,
easy to fly the banner of "academic
freedom" because nobody questioned
it. Government and politics were to
the student a very sordid business at
best, and "malcontents" were easily
dismissed as neurotic. Dr. MacQuar
rie was not hesitant to take advan
tage of the situation to build up
a "liberal" reputation.
But when the depression came,
Dr. MacQuarrie found he could no
longer use "academic freedom" as an
opiate to silence dissenting voices.
The depression raised the question
whether the college should be an
instrument of the capitalist class to
spread "defensive" propaganda, or
whether it should be used to arouse
students to the imperious necessity
of creating a new society which
would eradicate the basic contradic
tions and villainies of capitalism.
The middle course, if any, was to
permit both views equal license.
In this situation, Dr. MacQuarrie
proved his "liberality" by first ex
pelling June Wills for "failure to
co-operate" with his jingoism, as
expressed in the statement war "has
advantages for most of the partici
pants. ' Then, when the wave of

("protest became too enormous, he re-
I instated her, and "dismissed" Arthur
j Mintz, ex-soldier and ordained
I minister.
The question arises: does "aca
demic freedom" mean freedom only
for people who are in tune with
the status quo? Does it mean free
dom to talk, and not to act? Is strik
ing against war a crime against "aca
j demic freedom?"
Sincerely,
Philip Chamberlain
