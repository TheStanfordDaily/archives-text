# LIBRARY ON SUNDAY
## 
### 
! The Editor, Sir:
Recently an editorial appeared in
| the Daily suggesting that the Library
[.should remain open on Sunday
j nights. May I add my hearty second
]to this suggestion. It is sometimes
j inconvenient, because of guests, or
j for other reasons, to get to the Li-
J brary on Sunday afternoons, and it
is oftentimes very desirable to be
j there in the evening.
< After the good work the Daily did
jon behalf of temperature lowering,
i may I urge you to continue the cam
! paign for Sunday night sessions in
the Libe.
Sincerely,
P. B.
