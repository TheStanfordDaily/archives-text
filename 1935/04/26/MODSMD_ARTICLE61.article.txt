# Bunn Shapes Team for 1936 Basketball Season
## 
### GORDON FROST 
''The sooner the better" seems to
be Coach John Bunn's slogan con
cerning the beginning of basketball
training for the 1935-36 season; al
| ready the Stanford hoop mentor has
; put his pi'ospective varsity to work
for its first game, which probably
| will be played at least eight months
] from now.
Bunn is enthusiastic over the way
things are shaping up for that game
eight months away. Although he
1 doesn't wish to prophesy the prob-
J able line-up, from the way these
j early practice sessions have been
I running it is fairly reasonable to
' expect to see "Dinty" Moore holding

! down his old guard position with the
usual fast floor play.
At the other guard job might be
Bob Zonne, rangy frosh center,
whom Bunn has recently made into
I a guard. Zonne was forced to quit
j the floor before his frosh season
| ended because of illness but has since
j taken on weight and is in top shape.
The forward positions might be
held by past first-stringer Howell
Turner and frosh Hank Luisetti.
The center post is hard to pick,
! or even guess at. Art Stoefen, in
j eligible transfer of last season, looms
| as a prime contender for that job
' although Ken Nobs will be out to
l dispute the question.
