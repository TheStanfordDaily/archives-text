# SIDELINE SLANTS
## 61 HEAR POINTS BACK NEXT YEAR 
### 
La:st Saturday was 110 great occa
sion for cheers on the part of the
Stanfords. All they could do was to
smirk and with a light trip of the
tongue .say, "Well, there's always
next year." The sons and the daugh
ters oi the Bear said, "Ah, at last we
have started on a cycle, a cycle of
victory."
The Daily wandering reporter was
in a fog. Will there be a "next year"
for Stanford, or is the Bear cycle on?
So he began to compile cold sta
tistics. *
Cold statistics showed this: Out
of the 77' •> points chalked up by
California in the Big Meet, 61 '•> of
those were made by men who are
not scheduled to graduate for at
least one year, and who art'
counted on to enter the Big Meet
next year, in
Out of Stanford's 53Vii points, 40Vz
are supposed to come back and com
pete next year.
