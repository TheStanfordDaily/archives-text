### 
Back to the farm from Japan are

enlightenment of the studious and
I ambitious citizens of Nippon.
They were full of line things to say
for the Japanese. Their desire to
| become leaders in sports is well
known in this country. Football was
a practically new sport for them, but
they showed an easy adaptability for
it despite their small size. The Japa
; nese teams averaged about 130
| pounds, against the 185 of the ocast
I stars.
Good Ruggers
Inexperience anu size handicapped
' them on the gridiron but, on the,
I other hand, the American inexpe
j rience at rugby and the Japanese
speed proved 100 much lor the West
! ern lads in the English game.
Drown, who is at present visit
ing on the campus said that only
the single factor of size would pre
; vent the little islanders from be
coming first-rate football players.
i And not only the athletes them
; selves but the public took great
j interest in the sport. The people
| showed their interest and appre
ciation with a hearty display of
I hospitality.
In addition to the three Stanford
I men. the team had on its roster such
j stars as Red Franklin of Oregon
State, Chuck Mucha and Woody Ul
; lin of Washington, Cal Clemens and

' Although football is not especially
• adapted to their ken, the Japanese
have come to the fore in the past ten
years in several other sports. Their
baseball and basketball teams are
able to play on even terms with
many American aggregations.
In the Olympic Games their swim
mers were the sensation of the
aquatic events. In track Nishida in
the pole vault, Voshioka in the
sprints, and Nambu in the broad
jump were among the best.
