# Life Worth Living To Wheel Chair Student
## Philosophical Farming Is Boyd White s Job 
### 
By Robert Eiscnbach
Twenty-year old Boyd White took
his wheel chair and his insurmoun
able physical handicap 3,000 miles to j
attend Stanford University. Sun- j
; tanned and smiling, he rolls him
: self in anci out of classes while oth- I
ers run. sits in the sun while others I
play tennis, studies while others j
dance—and he's happy.
That's the most 'amazing thing ,
about this amazing young man, who [
has spent his life without oncp mov- !
ing his legs, and to whom medical j
science offers no aid.
To most of us it would be a tough |
: row to hoe, but to Boyd the world is j
much more important than his own ,
! troubles. He's interested in war, ;
j though he'll never have to fight; in J
| humor .although he has every reason
! to be tragic, in joy-riding, although j
he has to be lifted into his car and ,
driven by someone else.
Boyd has a future —one as certain j
as that of any other campusite. He is i
going to be a farmer—a philosoph- j
ical agriculturist, if you please—and j
he's going to till field and intellect at
one time.
| "I found out that you can buy a
' rich Georgia farm for little money |
and till it for a mere pittance," he j
j explains. "My idea isn't to make |
, money. What I want is time to think, |
j and while I'm thinking, something to ;
I keep me busy. A farm is just the j
j ticket. There's always something to |
! be managed, and if things aren't !
i done right, there isn't much lost."
He's sure that he'd be home doing ;
undirected studying if he couldn't be I
! on the Farm. At Harvard and Yale, j
! where Boyd might have gone, the
buildings are two and three stories I
I high, unnavigable to a wheel chair, j
"I came out West to the steps i
I of learning," he winks. "Studying on i
the flat, that's where I shine."
