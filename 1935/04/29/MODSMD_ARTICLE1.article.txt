# B.A.C. Sends Cardinals To I.C. 4-A Meet
## Individual Stars To Defend Card Title on Boston Track, May 31 S.C. FAVORED TO WIN Tennis, Golf Teams Will Go East with Trackmen 
### Gordon Frost 
Now we have the solution!
For weeks the ever important
query, "Will Stanford defend her
1.C.4-A. championship this year?"
has been buffeted around the Farm.
Skull and Snakes planned a benefit
meet as a possible solution. Athletes
pleaded with B.A.C. officials.
And now form the minutes of
the Faculty Athletic Committee
comes the answer" — individual
members of the track team who
make exceptional performances
during the current season shall
represent Stanford in the coming
1.C.4-A. meet at Baston."
So Stanford will be on hand to de
fend her title May 31 and June 1.
It won't be a Stanford team but "in
dividual members," perhaps half a
duzen of them, who will let the best
of eastern cindermen know that the
coastal Indian still cares.
Hand in hand with the track rep
resentatives will go members of Card
tennis and golf teams for "national
competition in the East," say the re
cently publicized committee min
utes.
Card Win
Just a year ago, shortly before that
Card team of seven men went East
to win the meet, the faculty ath
letic committee hinted that possi
bilities of entering a squad this year
were slight. Now we have their final
decision regarding early statements.
"The committee realizes that
changing conditions affect the rela
tive importance of those and other
considerations involving extended
trips. In such cases the committee
will therefore avoid long-time com
mitments, for or against particular
events or opponents, which establish
customs tending to prevent the con
sideration of each proposed trip on
its merits. A decision in one year
will not establish a precedent."
Entrants Unknown
The names of Indian entrants will
not be made known for some time,
but three or four are practically
cinched for the trip by virtue of their
previous performances this season.
Sammy Klopstock should be there
to show his dexterity at the high and
low hurdles, Captain A1 Blackman
with his 440 speed, and Johnny Mot
tram to throw the "spear."
Should Humbert Smith's high
jumping indicate the return of
strength to his injured ankle he
might be another traveler. The rest
can only be guessed at now but the
next three Stanford meets will de
tide definitely what other cindermen
will make the jaunt.
S.C. Strong
U.S.C. with her full team will be
the principal western contestants in
the meet if present dope holds true,
but Stanford's gang can be counted
upon to bold their colors high in the
fields entered.
Privilege to represent Stanford far
east of the Farm has been made a
reward for the handful of excep
tional performers of the sporting
field, but with the assertion comes a
final statement to the effect that
"good scholastic standing" is also a
needed attribute.

during the current season shall
represent Stanford in the coming
1.C.4-A. meet at Baston."
So Stanford will be on hand to de
fend her title May 31 and June 1.
It won't be a Stanford team but "in
dividual members," perhaps half a
duzen of them, who will let the best
of eastern cindermen know that the
coastal Indian still cares.
Hand in hand with the track rep
resentatives will go members of Card
tennis and golf teams for "national
competition in the East," say the re
cently publicized committee min
utes.
Card Win
Just a year ago, shortly before that
Card team of seven men went East
to win the meet, the faculty ath
letic committee hinted that possi
bilities of entering a squad this year
were slight. Now we have their final
decision regarding early statements.
"The committee realizes that
changing conditions affect the rela
tive importance of those and other
considerations involving extended
trips. In such cases the committee
will therefore avoid long-time com
mitments, for or against particular
events or opponents, which establish
customs tending to prevent the con
sideration of each proposed trip on
its merits. A decision in one year
will not establish a precedent."
Entrants Unknown
The names of Indian entrants will
not be made known for some time,
but three or four are practically
cinched for the trip by virtue of their
previous performances this season.
Sammy Klopstock should be there
to show his dexterity at the high and
low hurdles, Captain A1 Blackman
with his 440 speed, and Johnny Mot
tram to throw the "spear."
Should Humbert Smith's high
jumping indicate the return of
strength to his injured ankle he
might be another traveler. The rest
can only be guessed at now but the
next three Stanford meets will de
tide definitely what other cindermen
will make the jaunt.
S.C. Strong
U.S.C. with her full team will be
the principal western contestants in
the meet if present dope holds true,
but Stanford's gang can be counted
upon to bold their colors high in the
fields entered.
Privilege to represent Stanford far
east of the Farm has been made a
reward for the handful of excep
tional performers of the sporting
field, but with the assertion comes a
final statement to the effect that
"good scholastic standing" is also a
needed attribute.
Now we have the solution!
For weeks the ever important
query, "Will Stanford defend her
1.C.4-A. championship this year?"
has been buffeted around the Farm.
Skull and Snakes planned a benefit
meet as a possible solution. Athletes
pleaded with B.A.C. officials.
And now form the minutes of
the Faculty Athletic Committee
comes the answer" — individual
members of the track team who
make exceptional performances
during the current season shall
represent Stanford in the coming
1.C.4-A. meet at Baston."

fend her title May 31 and June 1.
