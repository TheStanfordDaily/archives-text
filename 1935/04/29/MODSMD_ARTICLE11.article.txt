# Hoover To Speak For Better Homes Program
## 
### 
With Herbert Hoover, its honorary
chairman, as principal speaker, Bet
ter Homes in America, a home build
ing organization, will hold its first
national convention over the Colum
bia Broadcasting network today at 12
o'clock noon.
Due to the extraordinarily large
membership of the organization,
which was founded 12 years ago by
Hoover, it has been impossible to
hold a national meeting of its mem
bers. Some of the speakers will talk
from the studio of America's Little
House, demonstration home of the
New York branch of the organiza
tion.
