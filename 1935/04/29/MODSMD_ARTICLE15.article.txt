Competition ran high in the va
rious aquatic events at Friday's Jun

dust, or rather the mist arising from
the lashed waters of Lagunita Lake,
had settled, it was disclosed that
Kappa Kappa Gamma had amassed a
grand total of 16 points to lead the
women's groups and Chi Psi with a
score of 11 and had nosed out Delta
Upsilcn by one tally to garner first
honors among the men.
Opening the Carnival was the
lengthy procession to the corona
tion ceremonies, led by Queen
Nancy "Fancy" Pettigrew and
King "I'll Be Hard To Han

Over 1200 spectators witnessed the
festivities from the southwest bank of
the lake. Included in the eight com

night shirt derby, and contests for
the most beautiful and the most orig

events were Mr. and Mrs. Elmer
Fagan.
Twenty-five canoes escorted the
royal barge with its rcg,\J occu
pants and their attendants to the
coronation. Twenty-seven living
groups were represented by more
than 150 students in the competi
tion that followed Ihe royal
crowning.
