# A 						Wise Move Sends Stanford to Boston
## 
### 
In one of the wises I decisions il has made
lliis year, Stanford's Faculty Athletic Com
mittee paved the way for an 1.C.4-A. track trip,
for an eastern invasion by tennis and goll
learns, and at the same time issued a well
thought-out commitment of policy in its last
meet i ng.
Ity thus moving, il rewards a group ol ex
ceptional track athletes who have put in a
year of hard work, and allows Stanford l<> go
hack to Boston to he represented as a defend
ing champion.
Perhaps il is hue that the Cardinal cinder
men are no world-heaters this season. They
were defeated in one big dual meet, and stand
to lose another. That is beside the point. The
point is that there are only two ways in which
an athlete is rewarded for the hours of train
ing he puts .in in his particular sport. One is
by clean victory well won against representa
live competitors, and the other is by trips in
which he may engage in his sport. There is
no denying the fact that an athlete wants some
reward for his efforts, and traveling, whether
for football, track, or any other sport, is at the
same time an incentive and a reward.
There is still another reason. The name of
Stanford is carried throughout the country by
the prowess of her athletic teams. When a
championship campus team goes back East
and defeats Vale or Harvard or the cream of
Kastern colleges, the value of such an encoun
ter cannot be minimized. A great university
maintains her name and her reputation by
her prowess both academically and athleti
cally.
The campus may not be very much excited
about its track team right now. II may feel
that nothing much will be gained by individ
uals going hack to represent Stanford, lint
when a few determined Card athletes pit their
skill against S.C.'s eighteen-man team at the
end of next month, there will be many anxious
radios tuned in on the Farm.
