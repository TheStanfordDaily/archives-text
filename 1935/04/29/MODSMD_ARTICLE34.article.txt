# Plurality vs. Preferential—Why?
## 
### 
Tomorrow probably one-sixth of the stu
dent body— about f>f>() voters— will decide
whether Stanford will eleet campus figures to
A.S.S.I', olliees by the present preferential sys
tem of voting or by the proposed plurality sys
tem.
Formerly the Farm selected candidates for
olliee by :t simple majority, where ;t revotc was
necessary it no one received more than half
of the votes. At present the preferential sys
tem is iu use where lirst, second, and third
choices assure a better, more accurate expres
sion of the true majority. And now the pro
posed amendment calls for a plurality ar
rangement in which a candidate, regardless of
the number of contestants, wins with an in
dividual vole larger than any one other candi
date.
Of the three systems, arguments for the
present preferential plan outclass those of the
other systems. The plan in use, although more
intricate, is the most titling for an intelligent
student body. It insures the election of the
most popular candidate in relation to the ma
jority of the voters, and does away with lime
wasting rcvotes.
The greatest fault of the plurality system is
the possibility of the election, in a field of three
or more candidates, of a nominee with a mi
nority backing. Examples of such results are
I«min<t in innumerable national and state clee
t ions.
Plurality backers will have l<> put to the fore
more forceful and convincing pleas before
Stanford will drop the present, more intelli
gent. and more representative preferential
system.
