# Measles No Cause for Alarm
## 
### 
Although today's total of seventy-one cases
ol (ierman measles sounds al first like a seri
ous epidemic, reliable medical authority as
sures us there is no cause for alarm. And sev
eral rumors, perennially present every lime a
disease hits the rami, might well he laid to
rest.
(ierman measles is hv nature a very light
disease; only in rare cases does the patient
feel serious discomfort or sutler permanent
harm; and not one case of really serious mag
nitude has been recorded here within the last
week.
Another ghost which might well be laid is
the one about the number of cases which still
roam the campus "because they won't take
any more at the hospital." Kven with seventy
one in isolation, the Palo Alto hospital will
slill accommodate patients. And if beds at the
hospital should no longer be available, every
case will slill be attended. There remains the
old isolation hospital near the golf course,
which can be put into service al a few hours'
notice.
â€¢Not even such a large number of cases need
prove cause for worry when the disease is so
light and when careful administration of the
students' hospital fund assures good care of
cverv sick student at all times.
