## PATRIOTS OF PLUNDERERS 
### CROMPTON BANGS, Jr 
BOSTON, April 27. —There is a lot of stuff printed
nowadays in most papers to the effect that certain
colleges are "hoibeds of radicalism," etc. Presumably
that means anything un-American. According to the
backers of the anti-Red drive all Americans should
band together and drive out all the UN-Americans.
Before we can find out just vyhat all this is about, let's
see what Americanism means. Then let's look at some
of the alleged RED colleges as well as some of die
alleged American organizations behind the anti-Red
drive.
If you were to go up to anyone on the street
corner and ask liiin to put his idea of Americanism
in few words, it would probably be: "Life, Liberty,
and the Pursuit of Happiness." This country was
founded to preserve the spirit of tolerance; with a
ft w exceptions, it has managed to do so. That is
what has nv»de it great. But as soon as tolerance
goes, so will liberty, and America will become just
another regimented nation like Italy, Germany,
Russia & Co.
This idea of tolerance is the basis of all education.
Without it any university becomes just a mouthpiece
for whatever group happens to control it. Look at the
universities of Italy, Germany, and Russia today. They
are organs of the government and teach propaganda,
not knowledge. Even in certain of our states radical
administrations have taken over the universities and
turned them into spreaders of propaganda. Look at
Louisiana for example.
Among the universities accused of being RED are
Chicago, North Carolina, Columbia, and California. In
Chicago recently a big rumpus was raised when a
publicity-seeking drug store magnate with an exag
gerated sense of his own importance withdrew his
niece from the university because she had been sub
jected to "communistic teachings," "subversive propa
ganda." How? Through assigned readings in an Eng
lish course, the book in question being the "Red
Primer."
Now the purpose of education is not to fill the
minds'of the students with as many facts as pos
sible, nor is it to reform them, nor is it to convert
them to any particular political beliefs. The pur
pose of education is to TEACH STUDENTS TO
THINK FOR THEMSELVES. Our democracy
rests solidly on the idea that our citizens will
think for themselves. When they stop thinking for
themselves and have their thinking handed them
by selfish groups instead, the long journey down
hill to Fascism and Communism will have begun.
So naturally it is important to preserve our uni
versities as places where our citizens can learn to
think for themselves and preserve the traditions
of our country.
These groups leading the campaign against RED
teachings are undoubtedly well-meaning. But we
have to take certain things into consideration. The
newspaper publisher wants more circulation; the
Legion wants to do something to offset the popular
belief that it is out to get all it can from the Treasury.
If there are REDS in our universities, these organ
izations have taken the wrong way to drive them out.
The best way to make students red is to suppress
them. This policy has never yet failed to work this
way. The way to get rid of what few red students
there are is to let them talk. Their ideas won't hold
water. People will soon find it out, and the more
they talk the more ridiculous they will become.
That is a much better way than the present method
of try in gto preserve American institutions by de
stroying them. Too often in the past, well-meaning
but short-sighted so-called patriotic organizations have
used one hated -ISM to destroy another, thereby
defeating their own ends.
If this use of Fascist methods to drive out alleged
Communism has been intentional and knowing, with
full regard for the consequences, the only thing we
can do is to place the so-called patriotic organizations
in the same class as the I.W.W.'s, Communists, and
Fascists as destroyers of our country and its insti
tutions.

turned them into spreaders of propaganda. Look at
Louisiana for example.
Among the universities accused of being RED are
Chicago, North Carolina, Columbia, and California. In
Chicago recently a big rumpus was raised when a
publicity-seeking drug store magnate with an exag
gerated sense of his own importance withdrew his
niece from the university because she had been sub
jected to "communistic teachings," "subversive propa
ganda." How? Through assigned readings in an Eng
lish course, the book in question being the "Red
Primer."
Now the purpose of education is not to fill the
minds'of the students with as many facts as pos
sible, nor is it to reform them, nor is it to convert
them to any particular political beliefs. The pur
pose of education is to TEACH STUDENTS TO
THINK FOR THEMSELVES. Our democracy
rests solidly on the idea that our citizens will
think for themselves. When they stop thinking for
themselves and have their thinking handed them
by selfish groups instead, the long journey down
hill to Fascism and Communism will have begun.
So naturally it is important to preserve our uni
versities as places where our citizens can learn to
think for themselves and preserve the traditions
of our country.
These groups leading the campaign against RED
teachings are undoubtedly well-meaning. But we
have to take certain things into consideration. The
newspaper publisher wants more circulation; the
Legion wants to do something to offset the popular
belief that it is out to get all it can from the Treasury.
If there are REDS in our universities, these organ
izations have taken the wrong way to drive them out.
The best way to make students red is to suppress
them. This policy has never yet failed to work this
way. The way to get rid of what few red students
there are is to let them talk. Their ideas won't hold
water. People will soon find it out, and the more
they talk the more ridiculous they will become.
That is a much better way than the present method
of try in gto preserve American institutions by de
stroying them. Too often in the past, well-meaning
but short-sighted so-called patriotic organizations have
used one hated -ISM to destroy another, thereby
defeating their own ends.
If this use of Fascist methods to drive out alleged
Communism has been intentional and knowing, with
full regard for the consequences, the only thing we
can do is to place the so-called patriotic organizations
in the same class as the I.W.W.'s, Communists, and
Fascists as destroyers of our country and its insti
tutions.
BOSTON, April 27. —There is a lot of stuff printed
nowadays in most papers to the effect that certain
colleges are "hoibeds of radicalism," etc. Presumably
that means anything un-American. According to the
backers of the anti-Red drive all Americans should
band together and drive out all the UN-Americans.
Before we can find out just vyhat all this is about, let's
see what Americanism means. Then let's look at some
of the alleged RED colleges as well as some of die
alleged American organizations behind the anti-Red
drive.
If you were to go up to anyone on the street
corner and ask liiin to put his idea of Americanism
in few words, it would probably be: "Life, Liberty,
and the Pursuit of Happiness." This country was
founded to preserve the spirit of tolerance; with a
ft w exceptions, it has managed to do so. That is
what has nv»de it great. But as soon as tolerance
goes, so will liberty, and America will become just
another regimented nation like Italy, Germany,
Russia & Co.
This idea of tolerance is the basis of all education.
Without it any university becomes just a mouthpiece
for whatever group happens to control it. Look at the
universities of Italy, Germany, and Russia today. They
are organs of the government and teach propaganda,
not knowledge. Even in certain of our states radical
administrations have taken over the universities and
turned them into spreaders of propaganda. Look at
Louisiana for example.
