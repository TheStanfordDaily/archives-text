# OUR HASHER SEZ:

### 
i Since Our Hasher has recently received the entirely
1 unwarranted and unjustified appelation of "scandal
• column," I will present a summary of the week's filth
! and refuse.
The most interesting event of the social season was
! the Kappa Alpha Thela open house of last Wednesday
i evening. Engraved invitations were sent around to all
1 the fraternities, and all living groups were phoned and
asked to come around and waltz with the girls. The
only sour note in the whole affair is that the engraved
invitations and the phoning was done by someone not
j a Theta, who apparently had as many bones to pick
j as Jim Copp's famous "Theta" saurian reptile. No one
was more surprised by (he proceedings than the Thetas.
That great Alpha Sigma institution —the Chappie
business department —was represented at an Eastbay
! wedding by a Mr. Claiborne. After performing the
necessary ceremonies, the business man found himself
on his way home. But during the middle of the voyage
of adventure, Mr. Claiborne's car, unaccustomed to the
meanderings of the road, and believing in coming
: straight to the point, jumped (he road and deposited
1 itself on railroad tracks just outside of the hamlet
! Alvarado.
After struggling with struggles to get his convey
ance off the right-of-way, Claiborne surrendered to
: fate and an S.P. freight. Claiborne was carried, "tails"
and all, among the hoboes and bums, to Oakland. He
i would not reveal whether he sold the SETAONIETAE
ads for the forthcoming Chappie "Love" issue.
Though an investigation was conducted to deter
mine if "Die Luft Der Freiheit Weht" at the Masque
Ball, education professors and assembled instructors
discovered that all students were breathing freely. It
seems that everybody went to watch everybody else
get calsomined, with the result that full-vision was
unimpaired. "King Kong" was the hit of (he evening,
but his performance fell flat for the investigators, be
cause there was no ground for an investigation. Of
j course, his unofficial visit to the administration build
j ing to buy a bawlout and renew old acquaintances may
have had something to do with it. I still think that the
first prize for (he most original costume should go to
Officer Burns, who was disguised as a policeman.
My outpost in the Toyon basement informs me that
several members of a certain eating club came home
from a certain unofficial bam dance held by an official
fraternity in buckets and had to be in a window
! by their dates.
House meetings have taken up the imperious busi
ness of front porch lights. We hear that in one house
! one ingenious girl got up during meeting and sug
-1 gested that an effective means of saving money would
i be to turn off the front porch light; another little girl
in another house is on the other side of the fence. She
suggests that the porch swing be moved out on the
: lawn, so that the porch light can be turned on and she
j can see to get up the stairs at night.
