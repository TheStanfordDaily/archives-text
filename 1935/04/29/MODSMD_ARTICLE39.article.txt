# BULL SESSION
## VOTE "NO," VOTE "YES," VOTE 
### 
If political science textbooks are
correct, tomorrow Stanford men and
women will perform the highest
function of a sovereign people: vote
to amend, or mot to amend the fun
damental law of the campus, the
A.S.S.U. Constitution.
Apparently doomed to a more
hectic life than is the fate of most
constitutions, the pride of the A.S.
S.U., will be dragged out, amended,
and once more left in the dust of
unlamented desuetude. Unlike pre
vious .years, the most important item
in the forthcoming plebiscite has
been accompanied by neither expla
nation nor ballyhoo. Its sponsors
have been strangely anonymous and
silent. We have yet to see any
thoroughgoing condemnation of the
preferential system of voting.
The only recommendation for the
plurality system of election is that it
is simpler than the preferential
method. But simplicity alone is not
a recommendation but an excuse. If
the preferential scheme is a trifle
more complex, it drops infantile sim
plicity for the sake of efficiency and
fairness.
The preferential system of elec
tion was originally adopted to elimi
nate the necessity for costly and
time-wasting revotes. But in addi
tion to that, this plan also insures
that the successful candidate at the
polls is truly popular with the Stan
for delectorate. If no candidate has
an absolute majority of first votes,

l the weakest candidate is eliminated, I
' and his second choice votes are dis- j
i tributed among the leaders. Thus :
the real feeling of the voters is de- j
termined. The system insures: (1) i
that votes are not wasted (for in j
; close elections, second choice votes j
j are important), and (2) that the sue- j
cessful candidate has not won by a '
! scant and indecisive margin.

The plurality system, if adopted, j
( would mean that an individual—dis- i
j liked by a majority of the student ;
body—could slide into office, merely j
; because the vote was split between
j two more popular candidates. Elec
| tion could be won by single vote
i margin. Demands for recounts,
j charges of fraudulent counting:
( these would be inevitable under a i
: system where so much hinged on 1
. one or two votes. True, the prefer-
I ential system takes a moment or two
of thought when voting. But when
j you have voted, you've got some-
I thing. College men and women
should be able to fathom the minor
intricacies of an intelligent system
jof ballotin. Vote "No" on the plu
rality system of voting.
The other proposition merely asks '
that the method of selection of '
women's sponsors—a woman's prob
lem—should be placed more directly j
:in the hands of the women. A rea- i
! sonable request. Vote "Yes."
So on the morrow, vote. Vote ;
"No" and "Yes." but nut on the j
| same amendment.

If political science textbooks are
correct, tomorrow Stanford men and
women will perform the highest
function of a sovereign people: vote
to amend, or mot to amend the fun
damental law of the campus, the
A.S.S.U. Constitution.
Apparently doomed to a more
hectic life than is the fate of most
constitutions, the pride of the A.S.
S.U., will be dragged out, amended,
and once more left in the dust of
unlamented desuetude. Unlike pre
vious .years, the most important item
in the forthcoming plebiscite has
been accompanied by neither expla
nation nor ballyhoo. Its sponsors
have been strangely anonymous and
silent. We have yet to see any
thoroughgoing condemnation of the
preferential system of voting.
The only recommendation for the
plurality system of election is that it
is simpler than the preferential
method. But simplicity alone is not
a recommendation but an excuse. If
the preferential scheme is a trifle
more complex, it drops infantile sim
plicity for the sake of efficiency and
fairness.
The preferential system of elec
tion was originally adopted to elimi
nate the necessity for costly and
time-wasting revotes. But in addi
tion to that, this plan also insures
that the successful candidate at the
polls is truly popular with the Stan
for delectorate. If no candidate has
an absolute majority of first votes,

l the weakest candidate is eliminated, I
' and his second choice votes are dis- j
i tributed among the leaders. Thus :
the real feeling of the voters is de- j
termined. The system insures: (1) i
that votes are not wasted (for in j
; close elections, second choice votes j
j are important), and (2) that the sue- j
cessful candidate has not won by a '
