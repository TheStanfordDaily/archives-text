# CAMPUS OPINION
## UNINFORMED CAMPUS 
### 
I The Editor, Sir:
I Tuesday an uninformed campus
I must vote on two constitutional
j amendments. The one on removing
I the women's sponsor's provisions
| merely means that these same pro
visions will be put in the by-laws
where they can be changed from
year to year as conditions demand.
The other provision for a plurality
system of election was put on as a
result of a petition which contained
;no reason for the change. Presum
ably it is because they are believed
! complicated. Nothing could be fur
| ther from the truth. Prior to the
j preferential system Stanford oper
ated under a primary and final elec
tion. To avoid the cost and trouble
of two elections the preferential
system was instituted because it op
erates as an automatic primary and
final. Your second choice is merely
j what your vote on the final ballot
i would be if your candidate was
I eliminated. If your candidate is one
! of the finalists your second choice
j doesn't have to be counted at all.
| Viewed as an automatic run off it
j shouldn't seem so complicated. The
j only complication is when politicians
| try to work it. It can't be worked,
j But if the preferential were abso
: lutely undesirable it would not have
j the evils of a plurality election. This
i (ype can only mean that in an elec
tion with a large number of candi
dates the man who has perhaps one
large hall or a few houses solidly be
hind him can win regardless of
whether he is the choice of the cam-
I pu.> as a whole. It will also mean
that a split in one of the parties will
be fatal to it if the other hangs to
gether. This will mean that a slav
ish devotion to caucus choices will
j be enforced and third candidates
j bought off. A plurality system will
| mean that campus officers will be
J chosen by a small group of hall or
| row politicians and foisted on a cam
-1 pus which neither knows or likes
j them.
American and Stanford democracy
! hove been built on a system of ma
j jority rule. Why change to plurality?
