# "WE READ IN AWE"

### 
The Editor, Sir:
Wc who live in Roble read in .two
the observations which appear every
so often in your paper. Some wc
( agree with, some we don't; thut of
course is natural. We do, however,
I realize the importance of your ob
i rrv.ition: , and the importance that

Student Opinion articles play in our
campus life. Therefore, we would
like to ask your opinion, and the
opinion of other students on what
many of us girls think is an im
portant question.
How is it that so many of our
graduates participate in activities
which nominally belong to u.s as un
dergraduates? Perhaps we are
wrong but it seems to us that many
of the positions held by graduates
could be placed in the hands of
those who don't hold A.B. degrees.
We would like to know how many
student body offices are held or can
be held by undergraduates, and how
many by graduates. Can anyone en
lighten us?
Truly,
Cynthia Hill
