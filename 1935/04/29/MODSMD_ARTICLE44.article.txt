# THE
						REVIEWER
## "STAR OF MIDNIGHT" 
### 
At the Fox Stanford
In the best "Thin Man" tradition,
with "Thin Man" star William Pow
ell, playing opposite Ginger Rogers I
this time, "Star of Midnight" man
ages to be a creditable imitator.
All movie hits start a cycle. Usu
ally successors to the original are
not as good as j
this. Therefore, i
this picture is
successful, yet. |
withal, it is not ]
as good as its |
prototype. But j
that doesn't stop !
it from being j

I good entertainment.
| Silliest shot: a newspaper with an i
| eight-column streamer: "Tennant 1
j Murder Unsolved."
! The ihird issue of "The March of
I Time" finally fulfills all that was ex- !
| pected of this series.
