# Seven Records Broken As Cards Place Second To Powerful Club Squad
## Klopstock, Lyman, Bright, Blackman, Mottram Star 
### 
Charlie Hunter's Olympic Club
team, fortified by real .strength in
the weight events, ran true to form
and tradition Saturday afternoon in
winning the annual Pacific Associa
tion track and field meet.
The Club piled up a total point
score of GO 1 ,; Dink Ternpleton's'
Cardinals followed with 39 : !'4 points.
A group of California athletes, com
peting unattached, score 31 XL > mark
ers to place third.
C"*rds Break Marks
Record breaking performances
went mostly to Stanford men. Seven
old marks were broken, five of which
were broken by Templeton's boys,
although two, Norm Bright and
Johnny Lyman, were competing for
the Club.
For the Stanford undergraduates
A1 Blackman, Sammy Klopstock,
and Johnny Molt ram were the rec
ord smashers. Blackman ran a
beautiful 47.9 quarter, a mark which
could have been whittled down con
siderably with three observations:
(1) Ai started in the second row,
had to make an early sprint to gain
the pole; (2) he was so far ahead
that he practically walked the last
15 yards; (3) a brisk breeze going
down the tunnel straightaway was
no help.
Klopstock showed definite supe
riority over his rival Tom Moore of
the Bears in beating him a second
time in the fast game, made more
so considering the wind, of 14.5.
Bright Wins Mile
Mottram easily outclassed Ed
Waterbury of the Club and George
Fink of the Bears with a record
javelin toss of almost 215 feet.
Norm Bright ran a 4:17.3 mile, the
fastest run on the Coast since last
summer in staving off the great ef
fort of Johnny Wall, the U.S.F.
sophomore. The anticipated "grudge
race" between Warren Dixon and
Bob Heavey failed to materialize, as
neither of them left the stands.
Johnny Lyman broke the shot rec
ord, beating his varsity rival, Jim
Reynolds, with a toss of 52 feet, 7's
inches. Chuck Nimmo flashed a
little of his old-time form in finish
ing fast to win the 880, after running
in the mile.
Dean Takes Century
Ray Dean and Chuck Voigt fin
ished one-two over a set of classy
sprinters in the 100. Phil Levy barely
lost to Herv Laßorde in the discus,
by a matter of two inches. Van Ginn
vaulted 13 feet to tie for fourth.
Humbert Smith, the Caid who was
injured last week before the Big
Meet, still found it painful to jump,
but his leap of 6 feet, 2 inches was
welcome news. His ankle is on the
way out, and Smith should be ap
proaching top form for the Troy meet
Saturday.
The last record was in the pole
vault, where Jack Mauger of Cal
tied with Paul Garrett of the Club
at 13 feet, 9 inches. Bob Clarke,
formerly of Cal, tied Kim Dyer's old
broad jump mark of 24 feet, 10
inches.
