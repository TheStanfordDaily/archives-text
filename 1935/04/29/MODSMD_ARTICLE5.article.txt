# DRAMA SOCIETY WILL READ PLAY
## G. B. Shaw's Play Will Be Given Wednesday 
### 
First Sword and Sandals reading
of the spring quarter will be George
Bernard Shaw's "The Devil's Dis
ciple," to be given in the Little The
ater Wednesday evening at 8 o'clock.
The play is an exciting melodrama
of the American Revolution period.
Mistaken identity, near-hanging of
the wrong man, and last-minute
rescue are some of the sure-fire ele
ments of which it is concocted.
Shaw wrote this play partly in
protest against the common o'ver
emphasis of love as a motivating
element in nearly all drama. The
hero is manfully about to sacrifice
himself in place of another man not
because he is in love with that man's
wife but because, as Shaw takes care
to point out, he "would have done
the same for any other man in town."
Besides sure-fire melodrama, the
reading has a sure-fire cast. In fact,
almost every role is filled by a cam
pus actor of note. Among these are
Rosemary Benet, Tom Seller, Caro
line Houseman, Robert Dwan, Dick
Dawson, and James Benet.
The reading is being directed by
Richard Dawson, while Jean Albert
son will read stage directions. An
admission of 10 cents will be charged.
