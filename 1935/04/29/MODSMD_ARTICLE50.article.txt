j for the Cards, who ran up a two-
I goal lead in the first period. Cap
i tain Bill Rogers drove a back-hand
j shot between the uprights from a
difficult angle for the first tally, and
i a few moments later the Redshirts
drove to another goal, this time by
Bill Enemark. Stanford retained the
! upper hand in the second chucker,
though Jack Budlong, high scorer
j for the visitors, slipped over a score.
Rogers Scores Three
In the third period the Arizonans
i began to click and two scores by
| Budlong put them in the lead. At
! the start of the final period, Stanford
! was trailing, 5 to 3. The Indians
I weakened and Arizona went wild to
i scoVe four times.

! the Cards with three of Stanford's
