## A 						GREAT DAY FOR NORM BRIGHT 
### 
Many of the fans found that the
climax of last Saturday's P.A.A. meet
in the stadium came in the third
event, the mile run.
Norm Bright's several years of
Stanford athletics have been help
lessly lifeless in that he, though
one of the greatest distance run
ners ever to come to Stanford or
,|o compete recently on the coast,
has been denied a single season of
collegiate competition. His years
around Angel! Field, on the other
hand, have been remarkable in
that he has trained faithfully, when
112 could take time off from lan
guage courses and his teaching,
for the day when he could put
everything into a race, and know
it would count for something.
One of those times was taken away
this spring with the cancellation of
the 1.C.4-A, benefit meet. Norm
wanted to see Stanford represented
at the eastern meet and was doing
all that he could to make the benefit
a success. He hoped to run one of
the fastest two-miles the Coast has
seen, for one thing.
But the meet was cancelled, and
Bright had to wait for the P.A.A.
meet. They didn't have his favorite
event, the two-mile, but Norm was
set to show in the mile aViyway.
Though a high class field was
running, the first lap was com
paratively slow, at least for the
kind o£ mile Bright can run. When
he heard "(>2" for the first lap.
Norm decided to quit fooling, and
he struck out before they «r«t <>IT
the turn. Me was never headed,
though Johnny W-vll of San Fran
cisco University, a great foot racer
himself, stuck till the last straight
away. A 4:17.3 mile hasn't been
run in Northern California since
( he Olympic trials, and those who
know Norm Bright are mighty
happy that the honor was his.
