# STANFORD SCORES SWEEP IN TENNIS TOURNEY AT OJAI
## Law, Dey, Seward, Pommer Figure in Net Wins 
### 
{ Ojai Valley's annual tennis tour
j nament turned out to be just a
j breeze for Stanford, Saturday, as
j Johnny Law defeated Bill Seward,
! 6-3, 6-3, in an all-Cardinal singles
final in the collegiate division, and
Ben Dey and Bob Pommer, Stan
ford's doubles team, trounced Tro
j jans Charley Carr and Jack Kne
i meyer, 6-3, 6-4.
Law had gone south Wednesday
i with a weak ankle, and Seward had
I expected to enter the doubles com
petition with Dey instead of playing
! singles. A change in plans brought
I the Indian sophomore and junior to
jgether in the finals, and Law justi-
I lied his position as Number 1 man on
j the Coast's championship team.
I Dey and Pommer, both sopho
; mores, had little trouble in their
straight-set victory over Carr and
Knemeyer. Carr had been favored
to meet Law in the singles final, and
Knemeyer has a good doubles rec
ord. The Card pair was at the top of
its collective game, and brought fur- ;
i thcr honors to the Farm.
i Frank Shields conquered Gene
I Mako, 7-5, 6-4, in the men's singles
■ final, and Shields and Mako took the i
; measure of Jack Tidball and Gerald
J Bartosh by a 7-5, 6-1 margin in the
I doubles. Since both Mako and Tid- !
I ball competed only last year in the
I college division of this tourney, the
performances of Law, Seward, Dey,
and Pommer show real promise.
Stanford will send several out
i standing netmen back to the Na
tional Intercollegiate Tennis Tour
nament, the time and place of which
i have not yet been fixed. This event
j will probably be held in June, and
I Law, Seward, Dey, and Captain Sam
| Lee have perhaps the best chances
I of making the trip. Pommer and Jack
j Lynch are also being considered, and
j it is possible that all six may go.
