# FIRST SIX MEN ON I.C.4-A. LIST NAMED BY DINK
## Indian Tennis, Golf Teams To Compete at National Tourneys in East 
### Gordon Frost 
Dink Templeton says that anyone
can pick the first six men he is go
ing to send East for the 1.C.4-A.'s
next month, and to prove what a
simple job it is Dink reeled off those
six names last night — Klopstock,
The others, if more than six go,
have the Indian track and field
mentor somewhat uncertain, but he
is quite positive that Dean, Dixon,
Nimmo or Hershey are the most
likely gentlemen to qualify for the
still undecided places.
May Go by Plane
Plans for the trip are still in the
infant stage. There is talk of send
ing the men to Boston by plane.
"Dink" favors this plan, and of
course the men involved agree with
him. But the expense factor still
figures heavily in the matter.
From the six cindermen who are
definitely slated to journey eastward
Stanford has reason to expect much.
Sammy Klopstock's hurdle efforts
on the Boston oval should stand out
as "tops" among Eastern competi
tion.
Captain A1 Blackman can be ex
pected to rate high in the quarter
mile. Both of these men won their
events when Stanford carried away
the 1.C.4-A. championship last year
and have every reason to repeat
their performances.
Mottram, Levy Good
Johnny Mottram has been con
sistently lengthening his javelin
throws this season! and should be at
his best in another thirty days. Phil
Levy is a potential winner in the
discus, his most serious competition
coming in the form of U.S C.'s Ken
Carpenter.
Jim Reynolds and Humbert Smith
stand high in the shotput and high
jump respectively and each can ex
pect to come back to the Farm with
good records. Smith's injured ankle
is the only thing that stands in the
way of a superior jump showing.
Netmcn, Golfers Go Too
The track travelers won't be Stan
ford's only representatives cast of
the Rockies this year. Coach Eddie
Twiggs announced last night that at
least four members of the Stanford
golf team will play in the National
Intercollegiate Golf Tournament at
Congress Country Club in Washing
ton, D.C., on June 24.
Twiggs expects to select his team
of ma.>hie wieldcrs by a scries of
match and medal competitions to be
held during the next few weeks.
Previous experience and records
will also be a deciding factor.
Along with the track and golf men
Stanford will send part ofr all of her
six-man varsity tennis team to com
pete in the National Intercollegiate
Tourney, the date and place of
which are still to be selected. Chi
cago looms as the most probable site
with the Merion Cricket Club near
Philadelphia running second.

Twiggs announced last night that at
least four members of the Stanford
golf team will play in the National
Intercollegiate Golf Tournament at
Congress Country Club in Washing
ton, D.C., on June 24.
Twiggs expects to select his team
of ma.>hie wieldcrs by a scries of
match and medal competitions to be
held during the next few weeks.
Previous experience and records
will also be a deciding factor.
Along with the track and golf men
Stanford will send part ofr all of her
six-man varsity tennis team to com
pete in the National Intercollegiate
Tourney, the date and place of
which are still to be selected. Chi
cago looms as the most probable site
with the Merion Cricket Club near
Philadelphia running second.
Dink Templeton says that anyone
can pick the first six men he is go
ing to send East for the 1.C.4-A.'s
next month, and to prove what a
simple job it is Dink reeled off those
six names last night — Klopstock,
The others, if more than six go,
have the Indian track and field
mentor somewhat uncertain, but he
is quite positive that Dean, Dixon,
Nimmo or Hershey are the most
likely gentlemen to qualify for the
still undecided places.
May Go by Plane
Plans for the trip are still in the
infant stage. There is talk of send
ing the men to Boston by plane.
"Dink" favors this plan, and of
course the men involved agree with
him. But the expense factor still
figures heavily in the matter.
From the six cindermen who are
definitely slated to journey eastward
Stanford has reason to expect much.
Sammy Klopstock's hurdle efforts
on the Boston oval should stand out
as "tops" among Eastern competi
tion.
Captain A1 Blackman can be ex
pected to rate high in the quarter
mile. Both of these men won their
events when Stanford carried away
the 1.C.4-A. championship last year
and have every reason to repeat
their performances.
Mottram, Levy Good
Johnny Mottram has been con
sistently lengthening his javelin
throws this season! and should be at
his best in another thirty days. Phil
Levy is a potential winner in the
discus, his most serious competition
coming in the form of U.S C.'s Ken
Carpenter.
Jim Reynolds and Humbert Smith
stand high in the shotput and high
jump respectively and each can ex
pect to come back to the Farm with
good records. Smith's injured ankle
is the only thing that stands in the
way of a superior jump showing.
Netmcn, Golfers Go Too
The track travelers won't be Stan
ford's only representatives cast of
the Rockies this year. Coach Eddie
