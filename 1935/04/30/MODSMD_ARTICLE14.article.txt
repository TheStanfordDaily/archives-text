# KAHN'S LETTER PLEAS FOR SICK
## Hospital Patients Bothered By Noisy Visitors 
### 
President Marvie Kahn issued the
following statement to a measle
conscious campus last night:
"An unfortunate set of circum
stances has arisen in connection with
thÂ» 'measles epidemic.' Most of the
afflicted students are not very sick
and naturally they have a lot of ex
cess energy which must be i - eleased
in some way. The hospital staff real
izes that it is hard to coop up per
sons who feel quite well, but it is its
duty to keep the measles from
spreading.
"I should like to appeal to the
sense of consideration of those stu
dents who have been visiting their
friends in the hospital. I under
stand that there has been an undue
amount of loud talking carried on
between the inmates and visitors.
We must show more consideration
for those who are really sick. Some
visitors stand in the street and yell
up to their friends on the third and
fourth floors. Also, some of the
confined students have been guilty
of making unnecessary noise. The
hospital staff is doing its best to
hasten release of afflicted students,
and the least we can do is to be
gentlemanly and co-operative.
"I understand that, conditions have
improved the last few days. Let us
be good sports and keep up the good
work."
