# Good-Sized Sums Derived From Ball, Brunch, Drive
## 
### 
Convalescent Home finances are
progressing satisfactorily, according
to Giff Myers, general treasurer of
the drive, but no complete figures
are available as yet.
The Masque Ball ended with
black marks on the ledger, Bob
Church, chairman, announces. Bean
Day, under Wally Brooke's chair
manship, brought in another tidy
sum, and the Strawberry Brunch,
chairmanned by Jean KaufTman and
Vic Martin, was well on the way to
grossing $100, of which the drive gets
25 per cent and the Y.W.C.A. 75 per
cent.
