# Law Students Stoop to Penny Tossing
## 
### 
Always cluttered up are the Law
steps. With senior men, with cig
arette pulling law students, and
now—
"I'm matching you—l'm closest; I
win."
Not content with simply standing
on the traditionally sacred flight
where underclassmen and women
arc barred, the would-be lawyers
now must draw attention to their
presence with pitch-penny and
matching games.
Each morning between classes the
crowds are drawn to the scene of
competition. While two or three
branches stand huddled matching,
others toss against the side of the
building. It's relaxing to the mind,
they say. And it draws eyes—femi
nine eyes. One woman has even been
seen tossing away her pennies.
A few old timers look with scorn
on the high-schoolish pastime, and
in the last couple of days things have
quieted down «ome. The tradition of
the law steps, threatened, does not
nppe.ir wholly doomed.
