# Bush Upholds Journalism in Radio Speech
## Claims 99 Per Cent Of News Accurate 
### 
A caricature, not the real newspa
per man, has been portrayed by the
stage and movies in recent years,
said Professor Chilton R. Bush, ex
ecutive head of the Division of Jour
nalism, in his radio talk "Reporting

the Daily News" over station KGO
last night at 8 o'clock for the Stan
ford hour.
Professor Bush contended that
!)9 per cent of the news published
is accurate, although on some oc
casions newspapers deliberately
distort or suppress facts. "In the
last fifty years," he pointed out,
"the press associations in order
to serve newspapers of various
shades of political opinion have
caused newspapers to be fairly
objective in the presentation of
news."
A further reason for this accuracy
is that the newspaper man's training
protects him rather well from those
informants who desire to deceive
him. The newspaper reporter is a
person who has reported several
events of similar character; he has
developed a critical sense and
learned how to check apparent facts
against his sense of probabilities.
According to Professor Bush,
"the press is not a great floodlight
that is constantly bathing the pub
lic scene in light but is rather an
erratic searchlight that one mo
ment focuses here and at another
moment there."
He explained that the reason for
this is that the press has to conform
to an established pattern in the
reader's mind, that it must furnish
diversion and entertainment for the
ordinary reader as well as news
about investments, while for others
it must be news about personalities
and conflicts of various kinds. News
stories must be tragic dramas and
even sections of epic dramas in
combination with a certain propor
tion of comic relief.
In closing Professor Bush said that
newspapers have improved in the
last quarter-century as have the
newspaper men, although they still
merit more improvement. He urged
that if the public wants a better
newspaper they should demand of
the publisher a better paper as they
demand better foods from the gro
cery stores.
