### 
Shafts of typical Shavian wit will
fly across Ihe Little Theater stage
tomorrow evening a< 8 o'clock when
Sword and Sandals presents a read
ing; of George Bernard Shaw's "The
Devil's Disciple."
Shaw directs his satire at several
objects in this play. First of all, he
ridicules the notion that romantic
love must be the motive of heroic
action. When the hero in his play
takes the place of a pastor about to
be hanged, the pastor's wife .says, in
cffect, "Ah, you did all this for me!"
"Heck no," says the hero (again in
effect), "I would have done the same
for any other man in town!"
Richard Dudgeon, the black sheep
of his family and " The Devil's Dis
ciple," turns out to be the only de
cent and likeable person in the play,
in sharp contrast to the Puritanism
of the rest of his family.
Militarism comes in for its share
<if Shavian ridicule in the character
of General Burgoyne, leader of
British forces during the American
Revolution, in the period of which
the play is laid. Burgoyne's reputa
tion is done no good by Shaw's treat
ment of him.
In the role of the hero, Richard
Dudgeon, is James Benet, star of
many Sword and Sandals readings.
In the exceptionally strong support
ing cast are to he found such well
known campus actors as Tom Seller,
Caroline Houseman, Robert Dwan,
and Rosemary Benet. The reading is
under the direction of Dick Dawson.
An admission of 10 cents will be
chargv'd for tomorrow night's per
formance.
