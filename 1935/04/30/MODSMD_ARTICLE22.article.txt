### 
Whether a plurality or a preferential system of voting will better
suit SLuiford's needs will be decided today at the Law Steps. The polls
will he open from 8:30 until 2 o'clock.

vided on the subject. President

proposed system because he believes
that it is simpler and more easily
understood method of balloting.
Interclub council favors the
j change for much the same reasons,

it is undemocratic.
