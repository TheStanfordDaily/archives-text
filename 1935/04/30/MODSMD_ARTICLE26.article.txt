						Hospital Is No Place To Play Around
## 
### 
In Ihe comic strips there is a character
named Happy Hooligan. With a can on his
head, and nothing inside, he manages to get
himself and everyone around him in trouble.
There are a few hooligans around lliis
campus. They may not wear cans on their
heads, and their presence may be more or less
harmless most of the time, but they have
come to the fore in the Inst few days.
There are over sixty people in the hospital
with measles. Hecause the disease is not seri
ous, and because they are of college age, some
of tlieni have friends who think this is all a
huge joke. These are the so-called hooligans.
Their idea of fun is lo come around the
hospital and attempt to gel in rooms where
thev do not belong, since visitors are not al
lowed. They have been sneaking in side en
trances, in emergency doorways, and worst
of all, they have been leaning out of cars and
calling u | > to their friend Jim, up on the
fourth floor.
Such procedure may be fun. II probably
registers at Kncina where many hours are
passed in ingenious pursuits. But it so hap
pens that it is the Palo Alio Hospital which
is being annoyed, and in this institution are
many seriously ill people. Respect for these
patients should be enough to keep all stu
dents who have no business there away from
the hospital.
It is up to the students themselves. They
can continue to honk their horns, call from
automobiles, and hoist food up to their quar
antined pals. If they do, drastic steps will
soon be taken by hospital ollicials, for the
hospital itself belongs to the citizens of Palo
Alto, and is not a t'niversitv establishment.
