# An Answer to Ignorance
## 
### 
A sensible, scholarly reply came recently to
I lie proclamation of a Midwestern chain-store
druggist that his niece., "insidiously exposed
to Communistic influences," was being with
drawn from the t niversilv of Chicago, whose
fault seemed to lie in freedom of thought.
The reply came from the president of that
institution, able, young Robert Maynard
liutchins, who in :i few years has made a
name for himself :is an intelligent, progres
sive educator.
"Freedom of inquiry, freedom of discus
sion, and freedom of leaching—wit bout these
a university cannot exist. . . . Without these
it becomes :i political party or an agency *>l
propaganda. . . . The university exists only
to find and communicate the truth. . . ."
With these words Dr. liutchins laid out a
policy which should be the keynote of modern
American education that the important
thing in learning is: first, ascertain facts; and
second, treating problems and possible solu
tions peaceably and progressively.
The irate uncle objected to reading,s which
gave a Communistic viewpoint, lie disbe
lieves in that education, therefore, which
gives every side an opportunity to speak, and
believes that the only right lies in tradition.
Freedom of inquiry is the prime essential
ol education, and if that inquiry is objective,
fair, and if corrective theories postulated are
investigated intelligently, then no sensible
observer can have cause for complaint.
The present time is ideal for the tradition
ally apathetic American student to lake the
lead in the matter of fair thought on all sub
jects. With the great universities of Kurope
under the thumb of-dictatorship, they have
by Dr. liutchins' definition ceased to educate;
and this situation gives Americans a chal
lenge, and a definite opportunity to prove
their belief in t lie ideal which they call
"Americanism."
