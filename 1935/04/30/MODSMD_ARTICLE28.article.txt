# Winning Tennis on the Farm
## 
### 
The Stanford tennis team has finished what
lias been one <>l its most successful seasons
in the |>;isl five years. Sweeping through eoast
< oinpet ilion, the si\ Cardinal net men won
by overwhelming scores every conference
match in which they played.
Last week-end saw the complete triumph
of the Indian netinen in coast intercollegiate
tennis when hoth the singles and doubles
crowns were won by Stanford men at Ojai.
Two Stanford men fought it out for the sin
gles title and it wasn't even close in the
doubles matches.
When these men go Mast in June to repre
sent Stanford in the Intcrcollegiates, there is
an excellent possibility that they will bring
back to the Farm the annual trophy which
has been missing from Kncinn gym since
1933, and especially the singles crown.
