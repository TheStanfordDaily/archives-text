# The 						College Undergraduate Changes
## 
### 
From all the demonstrations, soap-bo\ ora
lory, and riots that have accompanied tin

growing anti-war feeling in the nation's col
leges emerges the realization of an inherent
change in tlie American undergraduate of the
past fifteen years.
Irwin Kdinan, professor of philosophy at
(,<;luinbia I Diversity, describes the change as
"complex, hut not in essence hard to de
scribe." The undergraduate, lie says, comes
out ";i more serious and mature person than
his predecessor of ;i generation ago."
I he change is attributable partly to :i new
seriousness and realization of the possibilities
of college ;is a background for a career, t'ni
versilies are no longer the training ground
nV'ielv for the clergy and the bar. They are
gradually becoming the place where a student
out of high school may seek a general and
broadening education. As the Carnegie re
port put il : "the object |of general education]
is the individual to make of him a positive,
responsive contributing unit in social affairs
l>\ cultivating him to the limit of his /joiners."
The leport goes on to speak of the "progres
sive deflation of the old happy-go-lucky col
lege spirit of the 'twenties."
Responsiveness to the social situation has
begun to follow, though not so markedly, the
student trends of European colleges. The un
dergraduate's attention is turned more and
more toward life outside his school. He takes
a middlc-of-tlie-road attitude toward studies
he is neither a scholastic gypsy nor a play
boy. Economies and politics, especially since
11)20, become living subjects, not the dead
matter of textbooks. Besides Ihis new politi
cal realization, there is the interest in litera
ture, the arts, and civilization itself.
In all this awakening of the undergraduate
to his place in a realistic world, a process
which has been foremost in the changes in
which the undergraduate has been going
through in the last fifteen years, there reap
pears more forcefully the inference of more
intelligently equipped classes being graduated
each year from the universities of the nation.
