# Drama Group Action Aired In Committee
## Student Heads Discuss Council Tonight 
### Irvin Jorgensen 
Dramatic Council, child of mis
fortune, hot-spot of intrigue, pathos,
and, curiously enough, drama, will
officially take its sponge before Ex
Committee tonight and throw it on
the oval table.
Ex Committee, hot-spot of ath-
Ictic awards, applications for
dates, and, curiously enough,
drama, will officially take up the
sponge, and squeezing it may or
may not find the juice of many
sour grapes.
Since the calm April day when
Dramatic Council voted to dissolve
itself, many have been the marches
and countermarches in the Thespian
world of footlights and make-up.
Every move has been clouded with
secrecy, so that all appears roseate
and calm on the surface.
But underneath the coating are
several bitter pills. Though ev
eryone is plainly disgusted with
Dramatic Council, and no one
more disgusted than the Council
itself, its dissolution may not he
so easy as partisans hope for.
First conscientious objector to the
passing of the Council is Dramatic
Manager Dick Frank, who so far
has pursued a policy of "passive re
sistance," which means an absence
of gunplay and fisticuffs. Like the
raven, Frank is sitting, still is sit
ting, in his office waiting for devel
opments, but so far has made no
overt moves to stop the decline and
fall of the Council.
Second opponent will he Stu
dent Manager Ben Cave, who
smells several financial rats in
the proceedings. Both Cave and
Frank will he at Ex Committee
meeting tonight, and may or may
not actively oppose the conten
tions of such Dramatic Council
radicals as Jim Bcnet, Henry
Brill, and Boh Ransom.
If Ex Committee survives the Dra
matic Council battle tonight, it will
also have to discuss a report on the
binder dividers controversy by the
committee composed of Ben Cave,
A.S.S.U. President Kahn, and Pub
lications Council President Gordon
Steechnan; canvass the election re
sults; and consider a proposal to
make laws governing baseball
awards more elastic.
