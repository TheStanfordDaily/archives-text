## JAPANESE TRADE: YAMATO ICHIHASHI 
### CEDRIC LARSON 
Japan's remarkable progress as an industrial nation
is known to all the world. What is not known gener
ally, however, is that her trade constitutes but little
more than 3 per cent of the aggregate of the world's
export commerce in value, while a hue and cry is
raised by rivals that Japan is capturing the markets
of the world.
Accusations levelled against Nippon by her com
petitors may be reduced to five stock arguments, ac
cording to Dr. Yamato Ichihashi of the history depart
ment, who has just completed a survey of the subject.
These charges briefly are: Japan deliberately
depreciates the exchange value of the yen to stim
ulate export trade; Nippon subsidizes shipping to
such an extent so that dumping of goods on foreign
markets is facilitated: goods are exported below
cost: "sweat shop" labor conditions prevail; and
social dumping of products is prevalent.
As for the first chui'ge, Japan is only keeping step
with United States, the British Empire and its satel
lites in forsaking gold for a silver basis. Low exchange
may tend to stimulate exports, but the advantages
arising from this source are nullified when import
totals exceed export totals. Low exchange then acts as
a boomerang, so Japan could hardly be accused of
purposely deflating her currency for trade's sake.
Regarding maritime subsidies, Japan is far out
stripped by her competitors in granting subventions
for ocean-bourne traffic. Equalizing governmental
grants at par for 1933, and taking the Japanese sub
sidy at 100, comparative index numbers reveal that
Great Britain granted 93, France 218. Italy 383, and
the United States 582. Certainly none of these major
countries could point an accusing finger at the Japanese
on account of subsidies.
"The charge that Japanese goods are exported
at prices below the cost of production is so ridicu
lous it requires no clarification. In countries which
maintain high tariffs, however, the export prices
of goods are frequently below their prices in home
markets. For instance, one can buy a number of
American products cheaper in Japan than at home;
such an anomalous situation can be explained only
by the American tariff policy," says the historian.
Evidence that the supposed "sweat shop' conditions
of labor prevail in Japan is altogether lacking. Child
labor has been largely abolished, and social legislation
ensures the workman a reasonable amount of security
against the vicissitudes of industry and old age. Where
wages are proportionately lower than abroad, prices
may be equated to a corresponding plane, so the stand
ard of living is no lower in Japan than elsewhere. On
the contrary, the Japanese workman in the depression
era has fared better on the whole than his brothers
in other industrial nations.
A representative of the International Labor
Office, -\fter investigating labor conditions in Japan
most carefully, stated specifically that social dump
ing, or the promotion of national exports by de
creasing manufacturing cost or maintaining a low
level of working conditions, does not exist in Jap;m.
The most efficacious method of ironing out trade
differences is around the conference table, and not by
crying hysterically in the press, "menace" ;>nd "yellow
peril." "Japan's successes in foreign trade can never
be ascribed to unfair methods or practices," concludes
Dr. Ichihashi.
