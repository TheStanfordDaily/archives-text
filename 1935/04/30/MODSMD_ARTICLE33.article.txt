### WHY STUDENTS GROW COLD 
If the Dippy is right, Professor
Thomas Bailey will address the re
united Class of '34 on the subject,
'"Why Professors Grow Gray." Al
though Dr. Bailey stands up under
the hammering rather well, the talk
should be very illuminating. And we
suggest that, as a companion dis
cussion, there be a seminar on the
equally important subject: "Why
Students Grow Cold."
The two things should be con
fabulated over in conjunction. For
we suspect that both are part of a
very vicious cycle, to-wit: profes
sors grow gray because students
grow cold because professors grow
gray because ... Of course, it is
difficult to tell which came first, the
chicken or the egg. All that is known
is that there IS a very close rela
tionship between the chicken and
the egg. Which does not mean (as
some way be led to think) that pro
fessors are chickens or that students
are eggs or vice versa.
In explanation, if not defense, of
the students, it may be said that
many students grow cold because
many professors are gray to begin
with. (And grayness is not a state
of hair, but of mind.) Neither bril
liant nor dismissable. there are many
professors who take a gray subject,
present it in a gray way, and make a
gray day still grayer. Nothing so
dampens one's ardor for academic
learning as stodgy pedagogy.
The teaching which consists of an
outpouring of picayunish detail not
only leaves students cold but is of
very dubious merit. It is no wonder
that the student—subjected to hour
after hour of unrelieved minutae—
takes no genuine interest in the sub

ject under discussion, finds no spir
itual friendship with the professor,
and takes every opportunity to flee
the clutches of the lecturer and his
teachings.
The teaching which consists of
multitudes of specialized fact—total
ly unrelated to the specialized fact of
other courses, ana to the facts of the
live world—is also an element in the
gradual freezing of scholarly en
thusiasm. There are many profes
sors—sunk in one tiny corner of the
academic world—who take the atti
tude that God created that one cor
ner, and then rested. "All else is un
important." (Hearing that sage ad
vice from a dozen different depart
ments at the same time, even the
most stupid of students grows some
what incredulous.) The bewildered
undergraduate, torn between com
peting sets of disconnected fact,
takes refuge in the easy assumption
that nothing of what he has learned
is applicable to anything else. The
mastery of fact becomes a mental
exercise. And the exercise is for
gotten after graduation.
In explanation, if not defense, of
the professors, it may be said that
many professors grow gray because
many students are cold to begin
with.
The incompatibility ("mental cru
elty") of grays and colds, or colds
and grays, will continue until the
divorce court intervenes. The court
must put the natural-born grays in
the bookcases, where they belong,
and put the natural-born colds out
side of the classrooms, where they
belong. Until that happy day, pro
fessors will continue to prow gray,
students to grow cold, professors to
grow gray, ad absurdum.
