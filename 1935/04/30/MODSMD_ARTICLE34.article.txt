The Editor, Sir:
Recent discussion and student ar- j
tides have raised the question con- j
cerning the eligibility cf graduates ;
and undergraduates for A.S.S.U.
offices.
Although in the past this problem
has been of little consequence, it is
possible that future elections may
necessitate a choice between an un
dergraduate officer and a graduate, j
and if this is to b the case there
will be some who feel strongly for ■
01 against graduate participation. 1
There are a number 'of us who
feel that despite the maturity and
experience of a graduate student he
should be allowed to participate only
to the extent of voting and discus
sion. It seeing only right and con
sistent that there should be a defi
nite period -of eligibility for a stu
dent. For graduate students may be

enrolled until they become instruct
tors, or hold some other official post.
It would be extraordinary if we had
a citizenship or English instructor
acting as an undergraduate leader.
In a sense, graduate leadership
would tend to professionalize the of
fices of student government and
would certainly hasten at least a
modicum of undergraduate control.
Let's maintain the A.S.S.U. as pri
marily a unit of undergraduates and
keep our government in the hands
of those who are not likely to lose
contact with the undergraduate
body.

At the time Roble was built, fac
ulty wives were pressed into service
to help arrange furniture. They were
later paid 50 cents an hour for this
work by the comptroller's office.
