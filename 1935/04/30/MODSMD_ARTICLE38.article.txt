# INDIAN TRACK MEN FACE STIFF MEET WITH U.S.C. SQUAD
## Trojans Probable Winners In Eight Events 
### 
With the sting of the California !
defeat somewhat lessened by iheir \
good, showing last Saturday, Stan
ford's trackmen face a much more
serious problem this week-end when
they meet the powerful Southern !
California squad.
If comparative scores mean any
thing, just figure the result of the
Trojan-Card meet with the follow
ing: U.S.C. 71, California 60; Cali
fornia 77'l\ Sti.n'uil 58Vfe. That
should make the Troy bunch 35
points better than Stanford — on j
paper.
U.S.C. ifas Advantage
Cromwell's men have possibilities
of taking eight first places, with a '
sweep of all points in th v - pole vault. J
Every one of their four vaulters has [
cleared 13 feet 9 inches. The Cards, i
on the other hand, have only two j
iirst practically "cinches."
Johnny Mottram has tossed the
javelin upward of 30 feet farther
than any of the S.C. men, and Dud !
Sales should be an easy second in '
this event.
Reynolds Beats Hansen
Jim Reynolds has Hansen's shot I
put mark of 47 feet 9 inches beaten j
by about 4 feet and if Levy comes !
through here, the Indians might gain '

a second. Sammy Klopstock will 1
again be up against stifl competi- I
lion, with Cope doing 14.fi seconds in j
the high hurdles and Hall a 23.5 sec- ,
ond man in the lows.
Draper should take both dashes
and McCarthy's 47.8 in the 440 com- j
pares too favoi'ably with A1 Black- |
man's mark of 47.8 Chuck Nimmo's
comeback may mean that he will be |
;> serious contender in the 880. Troy j
has two men in the 1.54 class. Hum- j
bert Smith should take the high 1
jump, although he will be pushed j
by Spicer, who has done 6 feet 2
inches.
