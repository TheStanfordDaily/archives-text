IT'S LIKE DESSERT
TO STANFORD FANS

Nothing better suits the fancy of
Stanford t:rck fans than a thrilling
440-yard dash, such as one that Al
Blackman and Johnny McCarthy
will provide at Saturday's Trojar.-
Indian meet.
There are good reasons why the
one-lap event is a favorite in these
parts. Quarter milers have been re
sponsible for the most brilliant mo
ments in the past ten years of Farm
track history. Bill Richardson, Bud
Spencer, and Johnny Morrison a
decade ago made the fans expect
top-notch performances from Stan
ford 440 men.
They sol the best, the world's
record holder, in Ben Eastman —
still unapproachable in Stanford's
track history. Those who have
seen every stadium meet in the
past 20 years will say there's noth
ing that's given them a greater
kick than the sight of Ben Eastman
coming out of the tunnel with his
matchlcss stride, on one of his
classic quarter-mile runs.
A quartet of 440 men won the
other world's record after which
"Stanford University" is written.
Maynor Shove to Ike Hables to Les
Hables to Ben Eastman is a relay
combination yet to be beaten.
With this background of quarter
mile thrills Stanford fans can't but
be on edge over the coming Black
man-McCarthy duel. Both men have
47.4 seconds marks in the relay, and
have broken 48 seconds consistently
in the dash. Several years ago they
flocked to the stadium for the Vic
Williams-Ben Eastman races. Sat
urday it will be for Blackman and
McCarthy.

Lawson Little has done more to
make Stanford a familiar name with
the sport world at large than any
other single individual. Yet we con
fess we can't keep up with him, or
do him justice.
The few times he's been on (his
sports page since last fall were
when he was defeated by another
Stanford golfer, and the scribes
had the delightful task of rank
ing the greater amateur golfer of
1934 as third man on the Stanford
team. Well, Lawson is off again,
this time to defend the British title
which he dramatically won a year
ago. We read in the papers where
lie mastered the slight wrist fault
that has been the cause of his plus
par play. A pleasant sight soon
would be another picture of Law
son with the colossal trophy that
goes to the British titlist.

Speaking of Saturday's meet, one
of the more colloquial of the city
sport columnists has this to say: "If
the Trojans don't win by 30 points
against Stanford they had better go
back to the bushes."
Another squib concerning the S.C.
tracksters: they have a first class
discus man in Carpenter,
whose consistency over 160 feet will
make him the favorite over Stan
ford's Phil Levy. . . . Carpenter's
240-pound bulk and size 48 pants
should give the sports writers a
chancc to break away from the in
escapable mention of the size 13
undeipinnings that have gone with
Ihe name of Bob Heavey ever since
the season opened.

Lawson Little has done more to
make Stanford a familiar name with
the sport world at large than any
other single individual. Yet we con
fess we can't keep up with him, or
do him justice.
The few times he's been on (his
sports page since last fall were
when he was defeated by another
Stanford golfer, and the scribes
had the delightful task of rank
ing the greater amateur golfer of
1934 as third man on the Stanford
team. Well, Lawson is off again,
this time to defend the British title
which he dramatically won a year
ago. We read in the papers where
lie mastered the slight wrist fault
that has been the cause of his plus
par play. A pleasant sight soon
would be another picture of Law
son with the colossal trophy that
goes to the British titlist.

Speaking of Saturday's meet, one
of the more colloquial of the city
sport columnists has this to say: "If
the Trojans don't win by 30 points
against Stanford they had better go
back to the bushes."
Another squib concerning the S.C.
tracksters: they have a first class
discus man in Carpenter,
whose consistency over 160 feet will
make him the favorite over Stan
ford's Phil Levy. . . . Carpenter's
240-pound bulk and size 48 pants
should give the sports writers a
chancc to break away from the in
escapable mention of the size 13
undeipinnings that have gone with
Ihe name of Bob Heavey ever since
the season opened.

IT'S LIKE DESSERT
TO STANFORD FANS

Nothing better suits the fancy of
Stanford t:rck fans than a thrilling
440-yard dash, such as one that Al
Blackman and Johnny McCarthy
will provide at Saturday's Trojar.-
Indian meet.
There are good reasons why the
one-lap event is a favorite in these
parts. Quarter milers have been re
sponsible for the most brilliant mo
ments in the past ten years of Farm
track history. Bill Richardson, Bud
Spencer, and Johnny Morrison a
decade ago made the fans expect
top-notch performances from Stan
ford 440 men.
They sol the best, the world's
record holder, in Ben Eastman —
still unapproachable in Stanford's
track history. Those who have
seen every stadium meet in the
past 20 years will say there's noth
ing that's given them a greater
kick than the sight of Ben Eastman
coming out of the tunnel with his
matchlcss stride, on one of his
classic quarter-mile runs.
A quartet of 440 men won the
other world's record after which
"Stanford University" is written.
Maynor Shove to Ike Hables to Les
Hables to Ben Eastman is a relay
combination yet to be beaten.
With this background of quarter
mile thrills Stanford fans can't but
be on edge over the coming Black
man-McCarthy duel. Both men have
47.4 seconds marks in the relay, and
have broken 48 seconds consistently
in the dash. Several years ago they
flocked to the stadium for the Vic
Williams-Ben Eastman races. Sat
urday it will be for Blackman and
McCarthy.
