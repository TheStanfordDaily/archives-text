CHICAGO, April 29 (/P). — Six
home runs, two fist fights, banish- I
ment of four players, a 10-run Chi
cago rally in the eighth and a parade
of 10 pitchers marked riotous pro
ceedings today as the Cubs and '
Pittsburgh Pirates, meeting for the !
first time this season, battled fig- !
uratively and literally through two ,
hours and 41 minutes before the
Cubs won a 12 to 11 decision.
In between a barrage of homers,
including two by Gus Suhr and one
by Arky Vauglian of the Pirates,
and one each by Fred Lindstrom,
Phil Cavarretta and Captain Woody
English of the Cubs, the players en
gaged in a fistic encounter that led
to the banishment of shortstop Bill
Jurgess and Pitcher Roy Joiner of
the Cubs and Second Baseman Harry
Lavagetto and Pitcher Guy Bush of
the Pirates. All except Bush were
participants in the game at the time.
The trouble started in the fifth
when Lavagetto, doubling to score
Manager "Pie" Traynor and boost
Pittsburgh's early lead to 6 to 2, got
entangled with Jurges' spikes as
the latter covered second. Lavagetto
got to his feet with fists flying.
Umpires and players of both teams
swarmed on the field but before the
situation was under control Bush,
who was traded to Pittsburgh by the
Cubs last fall, engaged in a short
verbal battle with Joiner and then
rushed him, knocking the Cubs'
hurler to the ground with several
rights that brought blood to Joiner's
nose and left a six-inch scratch on
his left jaw.
Bush finally was off the field and
Joiner taken to the Cub clubhouse.
But Manager Charlie Grimm de
cided to take a hand, challenging his
former pitcher. Umpires and other
players kept the pair apart, how
ever, and Grimm was permitted to
remain on the coaching line.
The Pirates, with Waite Hoyt»
pitching steady ball, apparently had
the game well in hand until the
eighth, holding a 9 to 3 advantage
thanks to home runs by Suhr and
Vaughan. The only two runs that
had been scored off Hoyt were hom
ers in the fourth by Lindstrom and
Cavarretta.
