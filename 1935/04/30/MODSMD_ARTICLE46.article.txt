# Stress Passes In Grid Drills
## 
### 
Last year Stanford was noted for
its running attack and the gridsters
were often referred to as the "pass-
I less wonders." 1D35 will present a
different picture if the plans of Tiny
Thornhill work out as schemed dur
-1 ing spring practice sessions.
While yesterday's drill was de
j voted mainly to work with the dum
! mies and on ground plays, the In
| dians used a goodly assortment of
pass plays during the informal
i scrimmage last Friday.
Thursday and Friday will find the
Redskins scrimmaging again and
the ozone plays should form an im
portant cog in the attack. The prac
tice Friday is scheduled as a formal
I scrimmage.
Yesterday saw all but three vet
| erans on hand for the running of
| plays. Frank Alustiza, Woody Ad
ams, and Bob Reynolds were the
missing ones. The backfield that con
centrated on running plays was
composed of Bob Grayson, Bob
Hamilton, Ear! Hoos and John Reis
ner. Keith Topping, Dale Beedle,
Harry Carlson, Larry Rouble, All'
Brandin, and Monk Moscrip worked
in the line.
Friday's scrimmage will be run
off under game conditions and will
show to what extent the boys have
absorbed the wisdom that Tiny has
j been giving them.
