# Chief Dugan Proud Of Fireless Campus
## 
### ROBERT EISENBACH 
In l'JOti, a young fireman named
Bob Dugan helped a lieutenant,
Charles Brennan, haul dynamite
through the streets of burning San
Francisco. He remembers sitting on
a bin-load of high explosive with the
detonating caps clutched in his hand,
careening through shaking streets to
save the city.
Since those days, Chief Robert E.
Dugan of the Stanford fire depart

| mcnt has grown older in body, and
older in his knowledge of fire-fight
[ ing. The system of <;ampus fire pro
i tection is his work, the product of
more than 30 years spent in saving
I lives and property. He can point to
a record of minimum insurance
j rates, better protection, and an air
! tight system of fire-reporting that
! makes the university an unhealthy
spot for any kind of fire, large or
• small.
He has done it all himself, with
out the aid of professional crews.
He sits in his office, waiting for
the first click of the firebox ticker,
the ring of a telephone, while his
men, ail students, are scattered
over the quad in classrooms. His
department is the only college out
fit in the country staffed exclu
sively by students, and despite the
fact that none of them has had
practical lire-fighting training,
I Chief Dugan has kept campus fire
losses at an almost irreducible
minimum.
A special system for sounding
I alarms is his own original idea. It
' saves the extra man usually left
: behind at the fire house to blow the
; whistle. Any combination of box
numbers can be indicated by the
; device, which repeats the blasts au
j tomatically.
' Since he took over the Stanford
department in 1923, Chief Dugan has
had fire extinguishers, fireboxes, and
additional hose lines installed. The
investment has been more than
amortized by property savings, he
! revealed.
Believe it or not, the halls, in
; chiding Encina, are fireproof com

pared to the average fraternity j
and sorority house. "The Greek
I letter houses are my bugaboo," j
j Chief Dugan declared. "They are
i firetr;\ps of the most perfect kind."
Much of the danger, however, has j
| been eliminated by outside lire es
i capes, extinguishers, and prceau- !
tions in connection with oil burn- j
ers and kitchen stoves, he added.
Encina, although structurally a
fire menace, is one of the safest
buildings on the campus because j
of its high population ratio.
The "don'ts" for students in con- |
nection with fire are the same as ]
those for their parents. First of all. I
don't play with the extinguishers and ,
hose lines. Second, don't keep ben- ;
zine and naphtha, and always use I
! them in the open air, not in your ■
: room. Third, don't make new elec- J
i trical connections.
And if the chief comes around to
i the "house" and asks you to clean '
up the basement and chuck out the j
old newspapers, he's not just being [
I mean. He's thinking of the night i
i when someone drops his cigarette [
I and traps you in your room.

In l'JOti, a young fireman named
Bob Dugan helped a lieutenant,
Charles Brennan, haul dynamite
through the streets of burning San
Francisco. He remembers sitting on
a bin-load of high explosive with the
detonating caps clutched in his hand,
careening through shaking streets to
save the city.
Since those days, Chief Robert E.
Dugan of the Stanford fire depart

| mcnt has grown older in body, and
older in his knowledge of fire-fight
[ ing. The system of <;ampus fire pro
i tection is his work, the product of
more than 30 years spent in saving
I lives and property. He can point to
a record of minimum insurance
j rates, better protection, and an air
! tight system of fire-reporting that
! makes the university an unhealthy
spot for any kind of fire, large or
• small.
He has done it all himself, with
out the aid of professional crews.
He sits in his office, waiting for
the first click of the firebox ticker,
the ring of a telephone, while his
men, ail students, are scattered
over the quad in classrooms. His
department is the only college out
fit in the country staffed exclu
sively by students, and despite the
fact that none of them has had
practical lire-fighting training,
I Chief Dugan has kept campus fire
losses at an almost irreducible
minimum.
A special system for sounding
I alarms is his own original idea. It
' saves the extra man usually left
: behind at the fire house to blow the
; whistle. Any combination of box
numbers can be indicated by the
; device, which repeats the blasts au
j tomatically.
' Since he took over the Stanford
department in 1923, Chief Dugan has
had fire extinguishers, fireboxes, and
additional hose lines installed. The
investment has been more than
amortized by property savings, he
! revealed.
Believe it or not, the halls, in
; chiding Encina, are fireproof com

pared to the average fraternity j
and sorority house. "The Greek
I letter houses are my bugaboo," j
j Chief Dugan declared. "They are
i firetr;\ps of the most perfect kind."
Much of the danger, however, has j
| been eliminated by outside lire es
i capes, extinguishers, and prceau- !
tions in connection with oil burn- j
ers and kitchen stoves, he added.
Encina, although structurally a
fire menace, is one of the safest
buildings on the campus because j
of its high population ratio.
