| The Editor, Sir:
The preferential voting system is
logically sound. It's theory is beau
tiful.
It has but ohe imperfection; it
doesn't work in practice.
Reason — the voter is unable to
reach a sure decision in third,
i fourth, fifth, and sixth places until
he is positively and forcefully driven
| to make that decision, a stage of
| thought projection unreached at the
j voting booth whence he came to
j choose from his favorites, a pair, or
perhaps three candidates.
Question —which is the lesser evil,
j and honcst-to-God minority that is
I clear about one man or one prin
! ciple, or majority opinion moulded
merely because the ballot said: "Vote
for Five"? •
