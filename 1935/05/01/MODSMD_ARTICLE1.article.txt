It will not be only work. There
will be a barbecue, music, and en
tertainment. The day will end with a
lree all-University jolly-up in the
Pavilion.
About 1 o'clock today students will
take advantage of the University
holiday to flock to the Convalescent
Home and participate in the tradi
tional Labor Day winding up the
drive for the benefit of the Home.
Because of the measles epidemic
running through the campus, Mrs.
Ruth Atwood, head of the Home,
requests that all workers keep off
the porches and out of the various
living units. If anyone should
wish to telephone they may do so
from the office, which is located
in .the Stanford unit (the last rem
nant of the old Stanford home).
When students arrive at the home
they are requested to park their cars
outside the yard and then report to
the labor captains at the north side
of the home. There they will receive
their tools and assignments.
Captains Named
The following are serving with
Chairman Bob Hoover as labor cap
tains: Ted Geissler, Rawley Mac-
Roth, Shel Bronstein, Bob Foster, Al
Brent, Larry Rouble, Jim Mullen,
John Harvey, and Dewey Donnell.
Work will last* until about 5
o'clock. Betty Grover, women's
chairman, urges all women to come
out to the Home for there is as
much for them to do as for the
men.
To supplement the lamb barbecue
â– which will be prepared under the
direction of the master of barbecues,
Sam Mac Donald, will be a meal sup
plied by the various living units
throughout the campus. Cookies
and beans will cofrie from Encina
