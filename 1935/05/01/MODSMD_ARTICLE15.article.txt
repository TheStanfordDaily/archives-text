# ENGLAND TURNS AGAINST HITLER ARMS POLICIES
## France Prepares for Pact With Russia; Germany Remains Silent 
### (Copyright by Associated Press 
The arms situation in brief:
Britain seen veering toward
anti-German camp on arms situ
ation.
France continues negotiations
for pact with Russia, tightens de
fense elsewhere.
Germany continues officially si
lent on submarines; Hitler ex
pected to review army plans in
Labor Day speech.
Italian newspaper, "Giornale
Ditalia," lays bare Germany's 'in
serted "big navy" plans for 19155-
1936.
Communist International at
Moscow declares humanity on
brink of another World War.
LONDON, April 30 —Britain to--
night seemed veering definitely
toward union with those nations
openly opposed to Germany's swift,
surprising rearmament.
This was the situation foreseen
in competent quarters as proposed
Anglo-German naval conversations
stood "adjourned" until after Adolf
Hitler's .statement on foreign pol
icy expected May 15.
These quarters declared it was
now up to Hitler to make the next
move if he hoped to keep Great
Britain in her role of "good neigh
bor" and "honesty broker" as con
cerns the Continent's troubles.
Hitler To Speak
While French officials openly
voiced hopes of negotiating bilat
eral air agreements with England,
Italy, and Belgium, and the authori
tative Italian newspaper, "Giornal
D'ltalia," laid bare Germany's as
sarted "big navy" program for
1935-36, the British government
fixed its attention on Hitler's forth
coming statement.
Future developments in the tense
arms situation, the British were de
scribed as believing, will depend
upon what the German fuehrer does
toward clearing the atmosphere sur
charged first by Germany's army
and air expansion and then the reve
lation of renewed submarine con
struction — a revelation even more
startling to the British people, whose
memory of the depredations of Ger
man U-boats during the World War
is still fresh.
Decision Awaited
Prime Minister Ramsay McDon
ald, Lord President of the Council,
Stanley Baldwin, and other mem
bers of the Cabinet will make deci
sions tomorrow on the momentous
questions arising from the subma
rine "bombshell."
After today's postponement of the
Anglo-German naval conversations,
speculation arose as to whether
Great Britain might not cancel them
entirely. Pei'sons in close touch
which the situation, however, ex
pressed the opinion that was not
likely.

Anglo-German naval conversations,
speculation arose as to whether
Great Britain might not cancel them
entirely. Pei'sons in close touch
which the situation, however, ex
pressed the opinion that was not
likely.
The arms situation in brief:
Britain seen veering toward
anti-German camp on arms situ
ation.
France continues negotiations
for pact with Russia, tightens de
fense elsewhere.
Germany continues officially si
lent on submarines; Hitler ex
pected to review army plans in
Labor Day speech.
Italian newspaper, "Giornale
Ditalia," lays bare Germany's 'in
serted "big navy" plans for 19155-
1936.
Communist International at
Moscow declares humanity on
brink of another World War.
LONDON, April 30 —Britain to--
night seemed veering definitely
toward union with those nations
openly opposed to Germany's swift,
surprising rearmament.
This was the situation foreseen
in competent quarters as proposed
Anglo-German naval conversations
stood "adjourned" until after Adolf
Hitler's .statement on foreign pol
icy expected May 15.
These quarters declared it was
now up to Hitler to make the next
move if he hoped to keep Great
Britain in her role of "good neigh
bor" and "honesty broker" as con
cerns the Continent's troubles.
Hitler To Speak
While French officials openly
voiced hopes of negotiating bilat
eral air agreements with England,
Italy, and Belgium, and the authori
tative Italian newspaper, "Giornal
D'ltalia," laid bare Germany's as
sarted "big navy" program for
1935-36, the British government
fixed its attention on Hitler's forth
coming statement.
Future developments in the tense
arms situation, the British were de
scribed as believing, will depend
upon what the German fuehrer does
toward clearing the atmosphere sur
charged first by Germany's army
and air expansion and then the reve
lation of renewed submarine con
struction — a revelation even more
startling to the British people, whose
memory of the depredations of Ger
man U-boats during the World War
is still fresh.
Decision Awaited
Prime Minister Ramsay McDon
ald, Lord President of the Council,
Stanley Baldwin, and other mem
bers of the Cabinet will make deci
sions tomorrow on the momentous
questions arising from the subma
rine "bombshell."
