# Committee OK's 'Stanford School Of Theater' Plan
## Fate of Dramatic Council Undetermined; Wilbur To Be Consulted Women Propose Abolition Of King-Queen Contest 
### Irvin Jorgensen 
The Ex Committee went on record
last night as recommending "That
the faculty develop a Stanford
school of the theater," after debat
ing lengthily the Dramatic Council's
move to abolish itself.
Just what effect this might have
on the future of the Dramatic Coun
cil was not made clear in last night's
meeting, but seven members of the
committee thought it was as good
an idea as any of others proposed:
status quo, complete faculty control,
or faculty control of plays, with
student control of promotion and
finances.
Bill Rogers' opinion of the rec
ommendation: "You can't imagine
anything that says less," seemed to
be the consensus of the commit
tee's reaction. But that seemed to
be its chief merit.
Casting a weather eye toward the
Administration's attitude on the sit
uation, the committee was waiting to
see which way the various cats are
going to jump, so that if it is holding
the sack it will know where to
hold it.
The plea of Drwiatic Council
members Roliert Ransom and
Henry Brill that the only way to
the full development of a Stanford
school of the theater was to give
the administration a free hand
without any strings attached and
trust that a satisfactory financial
arrangement would lie worked
out, was voted down 5-3.
Student Manager Ben Cave's sen
timents that since Stanford students
were largely paying for the New
Theater they should get a chance to
realize some return, especially after
the years of adversity during which
the $1000 Dramatic Council deficit
was piled up, struck some responsive
chords in the Ex Committee breast.
Frank Fullenwider delivered an
impassioned speech for student con
trol of all activities to give expe
rience at the price of efficiency, giv
ing as an alternative that the cam
pus be run as an "Indian reserva
tion."
The final result of the debate
was the noncommittal resolution.
A committee composed of Al
Blackman, Henry Brill, Frank
Fullenwider, Marvic Kahn, and
Bill Stark was appointed to con
fer with President Ray Lyman
Wilbur on the subject to find out
what would be the proposal of
the Administration on the sub
ject.
A political bombshell in student
politics was quietly tossed into the
meeting, when Women's Conference
President Marion Storey announced
that it had been the unanimous de
cision of Women's Conference that
the Masque Ball King and Queen
Contest be abolished because it had
a bad effect on Stanford women.

A committee composed of Al
Blackman, Henry Brill, Frank
Fullenwider, Marvic Kahn, and
Bill Stark was appointed to con
fer with President Ray Lyman
Wilbur on the subject to find out
what would be the proposal of
the Administration on the sub
ject.
A political bombshell in student
politics was quietly tossed into the
meeting, when Women's Conference
President Marion Storey announced
that it had been the unanimous de
cision of Women's Conference that
the Masque Ball King and Queen
Contest be abolished because it had
a bad effect on Stanford women.
The Ex Committee went on record
last night as recommending "That
the faculty develop a Stanford
school of the theater," after debat
ing lengthily the Dramatic Council's
move to abolish itself.
Just what effect this might have
on the future of the Dramatic Coun
cil was not made clear in last night's
meeting, but seven members of the
committee thought it was as good
an idea as any of others proposed:
status quo, complete faculty control,
or faculty control of plays, with
student control of promotion and
finances.
Bill Rogers' opinion of the rec
ommendation: "You can't imagine
anything that says less," seemed to
be the consensus of the commit
tee's reaction. But that seemed to
be its chief merit.
Casting a weather eye toward the
Administration's attitude on the sit
uation, the committee was waiting to
see which way the various cats are
going to jump, so that if it is holding
the sack it will know where to
hold it.
The plea of Drwiatic Council
members Roliert Ransom and
Henry Brill that the only way to
the full development of a Stanford
school of the theater was to give
the administration a free hand
without any strings attached and
trust that a satisfactory financial
arrangement would lie worked
out, was voted down 5-3.
Student Manager Ben Cave's sen
timents that since Stanford students
were largely paying for the New
Theater they should get a chance to
realize some return, especially after
the years of adversity during which
the $1000 Dramatic Council deficit
was piled up, struck some responsive
chords in the Ex Committee breast.
Frank Fullenwider delivered an
impassioned speech for student con
trol of all activities to give expe
rience at the price of efficiency, giv
ing as an alternative that the cam
pus be run as an "Indian reserva
tion."
The final result of the debate
was the noncommittal resolution.
