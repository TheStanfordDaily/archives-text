# Students Down Plurality Voting System, 307-143
## Large Majority Approves Women's Sponsor Amendment FEW STUDENTS VOTE Lack of Information Keeps Students from Poll' 
### Bob Leland 
That Stanford does not care to
' have its candidates put in office by
] less than a majority of the elec
i torate was proved yesterday when
amendment dealing with plurality
election was snowed under by a 307-
143 vote.
The second proposed amendment,
which dealt with women's sponsors,
| receiving an overwhelming aflirma
' tion, 328-87. This measure held less
■ interest for the voters, with only 415
| students voting on it, as compared
with 450 total vote on the first
| proposition.

The inclusion of the plurality
| amendment on the ballot raised quite
i a fuss, drawing forth editorial nm
; ment and "campus opinion," but in
j spite of all that only 450 students
j turned out to vote their opposition
j or approval.
John Brock, election chairman,
j commenting on the light vote, re-
I marked that students seemed to be
I uninformed on the matters under
consideration.
Rule by Few'
"Many students," he said, "came to
| the polls and expressed lack of in
! formation on one or both of the
I amendments. This lack of informa-
I tion or interest led many to refuse
|to vote. It is too bad that. Stanford
j must be ruled by a few. There are
; approximately 3400 eligible to vote,
! but only 13 per cent of them went to
j the polls."
The principal objection to the plu
rality method of election seemed to
bs that it was not a system com
patible with democratic principles,
and that it would make for polit
ical machines, vote-trading and
other-evils.
Council Approved
While the measure was approved
| by Inter-club Council, not all Hall
! men were in favor of the amend
j ment. Consensus of opinion among
l the non-fraternity element seemed
jto be that the plurality system
j would favor a candidate that could
| get one large hall.
! No particular interest aroused
| by the proposition to remove from
; Women's Council the power to ap
i point and remove women's sponsors.

Council Approved
While the measure was approved
| by Inter-club Council, not all Hall
! men were in favor of the amend
j ment. Consensus of opinion among
l the non-fraternity element seemed
jto be that the plurality system
j would favor a candidate that could
| get one large hall.
! No particular interest aroused
| by the proposition to remove from
; Women's Council the power to ap
i point and remove women's sponsors.
