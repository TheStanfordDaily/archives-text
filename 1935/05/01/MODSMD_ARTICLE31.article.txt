# Minority Rule Amendment Quashed
## 
### 
A two-to-one vote in the special student
body election yesterday quashed the sudden
and quietly sponsored movement to supplant
the preferential voting system with a plurality
proposi t ion.
Three hundred and seven students saw rea
son to kill the measure which sought to foist
upon the campus a voting system which could
he manipulated by either Hall, How, or mi
nority groups to their ad-vantage in a campus
election.
I! was a triumph for those Stanfordites
who, backed by the Daily, fought and won a
battle to maintain the preferential system
which assures, in its first, second, and third
choices, a better and more accurate expres
sion of the true majority. It was a crushing
defeat for the plurality plan in which a candi
date. regardless of the number of contestants,
wins with an individual vote merely larger
than that of any other one contestant.
Although only four hundred and twenty
nine legal votes were cast, in a student body
enrollment of more than three thousand, the
defeat was an indication of the strong feeling
against any manipulation by minorities who
would attempt to take advantage of the small
number of voters in a normal election to put
through a candidate or a movement favorable
to tliem.
