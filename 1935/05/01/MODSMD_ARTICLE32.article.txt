# School of the Theater: So What?
## 
### 
Definite settlement of the Dramatic Council
impasse is farther away than ever this morn
ing, following refusal of the Executive Com
mittee last night to take delinite action on the
only proposal which would firing Stanford
dramatics out of their present serious slump.
The resolution which was passed after the
delinite proposal had jjjune down in a cloud
i I quibbling says practically nothing so far
as a settlement ol present difficulties is con
cerned. The I act that the Executive Commit
tee lavors the establishment of a Stanford
school of the theater is equal to similar ac
tion favoring a school of pharmacy, ichthy
ology, or cosmetology.
What the Dramatic Council, a body which
11111 sI he given credit for knowing its own
faults, proposed, was I Diversity control of
dramatics, in the realization that such a sys
tem would eliminate most present dilliculties.
There is no doubt that tin- present situation
is had. Meager audiences attend campus
plays, and go away not too satisfied, budgets
must he pared to the penny in order to make
production possible, with resultant loss in
quality. Where two hundred once tried out
for plays, a turnout of lil'tv is the rule today;
and campus talent drifts awav, preferring
well-directed activities at the Palo Alto Com
munity Theater.
Hut last night's action, in short, meant
nothing. It merely stated an opinion already
held by everyone interested in local dramatics.
The school of the theater will come eventu
ally; hut it will be the result of years of devel
opment, not the outcome of a mere recom
mendation by students, who have no power
to demand t'niversity departments.
And until some concrete action is taken, the
situation will remain as at present, an ineffec
tive jumble.
