# Medievalism in Government
## 
### 
Once again from the vaulted chambers ol'
Sacramento come strange still
aimed at that horrible bogey, Communism,
tlie Senate's judiciary committee reports
favorably on one bill, retaining two other
measures for further consideration.
the one approved would deal out instant
discharge to any school teacher who advocates
overthrow of the government by force. A
sweeping and noble gesture, truly, but one
made unnecessary by existing laws and sen-
I i mcnts.
Of the two yet to be ruled <»n, one sets up
a bureau for the investigation of "seditions
activities." The other, which should have died
long before it readied the committee, makes it
a felony for teachers to advocate subversive
doctrines, and also brands as a penitentiary
oJlcnse the possession by any teacher of what
may be construed as "seditious literature."
This little morsel leads to interesting specu
lation.
Not lon# ago, any religious or political
IkhiU which deviated in the slightest from the
orthodox became a certain candidate for the
bonfire. However, this sharp-nosed policy is
supposed t<> have vanished Irom modern gov
ern merit.

But the legislators, in a maniacal, frenzy

to the right nor to the left. Still obsessed by
the fear that some night they may find Lenin
