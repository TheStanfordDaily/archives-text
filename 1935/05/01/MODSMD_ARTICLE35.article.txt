## POLAND'S FUTURE: DAVIDSON 
### CEDRIC LARSON 
As the figure uf Mars casts at present a length
ening shadow over Europe, Poland,- buffer state be
tween Fascism and Communism, and bounded by some
eight political entities, assumes yeaily a growing stra
tegic importance. Landlocked on all sides save for a
short strip on the Baltic, the nation is susceptible to
invasion from all sides. The political affections of
Poland are wooed alike by emissaries of Hitler, Stalin,
and Flandin. The destiny of the nation is one of ex
traordinary importance.
Dr. Percy E. Davidson of the education department,
who recently visited Poland to investigate its educa
tional system, calls attention to some of the reasons
why this nation is forging so rapidly to the front rank
in continental significance.
"Poland is a nation in size about that of the
state of California, but with a population of 33,000,-
000. The country occupies a H\t, rolling terrain,
and is a fertile agricultural area. About 70 per
cent of the people are Polish and 30 per cent mi
norities, so there is a vital problem of minority
rights with which to deal," states the educator.
Poland arose, phoenix-like, from the ashes of im
perial Germany, Austria-Hungary, and ezarist Russia,
as a consequence of the war. The flame ol patriotism,
however, burned fiercely within the breasts of the
liberty loving Poles for more than a century of political
submergence, and the memory of the heroic reign of
Sobifeoki was proudly recounted by father to son.
After the war, faced with the Herculean task of
welding the Polish people into political homogeneity
once more, Polish leaders turned almost instinctively
to education as the chief means of attaining their end.
The Poles under German suzerainty had received
fairly good education, but those under the overlord
ship of Vienna and Petrograd hud been grossly ne
glected.
For nearly 20 years Poland has pressed steadily
forward toward a goal of 100 per cent literacy for the
nation, and the results in 1935 are gratifying. Today
more than 4,500,000 children are enrolled in Polish
elementary schools. There are 765 secondary schools,
205 teachers, colleges and 747 professional schools be
sides.
Professor Davidson stresses the fact that although
Poland is not a rich country financially, it has spent
large sums of money on its educational system. Gov
ernment officials are recruited almost exclusively from
the colleges of Poland. The Polish school system offi
cials literally scour the world for new ideas, and keep
abreast of all the latest trends, the Stanford educator
found.
"In spite of Poland's dictator, Jozef Pilsudski,
the people are thoroughly steeped in the demo
cratic spirit," states Professor Davidson. "Poland
is surrounded by eight political entities and is
without natural frontiers, therefore strong mili
tary leadership is deemed essential, but culturally,
(here is as much freedom in Poland as in America."
Three-fourths of the people of Poland are Roman
Catholics, but entire religious freedom obtains in the
nation, the educator says. Furthermore, Poland has
lived up to its treaty obligations in respecting the rights
of minorities.
With an enlightened citizenry and democratic cul
tural tradition, the future of Poland is a promising one.
"Compulsory education laws, and a fust-class school
system have played a major role in the social re
habilitation of Poland," concludes Dr. Davidson.

Professor Davidson stresses the fact that although
Poland is not a rich country financially, it has spent
large sums of money on its educational system. Gov
ernment officials are recruited almost exclusively from
the colleges of Poland. The Polish school system offi
cials literally scour the world for new ideas, and keep
abreast of all the latest trends, the Stanford educator
found.
"In spite of Poland's dictator, Jozef Pilsudski,
the people are thoroughly steeped in the demo
cratic spirit," states Professor Davidson. "Poland
is surrounded by eight political entities and is
without natural frontiers, therefore strong mili
tary leadership is deemed essential, but culturally,
(here is as much freedom in Poland as in America."
Three-fourths of the people of Poland are Roman
Catholics, but entire religious freedom obtains in the
nation, the educator says. Furthermore, Poland has
lived up to its treaty obligations in respecting the rights
of minorities.
With an enlightened citizenry and democratic cul
tural tradition, the future of Poland is a promising one.
"Compulsory education laws, and a fust-class school
system have played a major role in the social re
habilitation of Poland," concludes Dr. Davidson.
As the figure uf Mars casts at present a length
ening shadow over Europe, Poland,- buffer state be
tween Fascism and Communism, and bounded by some
eight political entities, assumes yeaily a growing stra
tegic importance. Landlocked on all sides save for a
short strip on the Baltic, the nation is susceptible to
invasion from all sides. The political affections of
Poland are wooed alike by emissaries of Hitler, Stalin,
and Flandin. The destiny of the nation is one of ex
traordinary importance.
Dr. Percy E. Davidson of the education department,
who recently visited Poland to investigate its educa
tional system, calls attention to some of the reasons
why this nation is forging so rapidly to the front rank
in continental significance.
"Poland is a nation in size about that of the
state of California, but with a population of 33,000,-
000. The country occupies a H\t, rolling terrain,
and is a fertile agricultural area. About 70 per
cent of the people are Polish and 30 per cent mi
norities, so there is a vital problem of minority
rights with which to deal," states the educator.
Poland arose, phoenix-like, from the ashes of im
perial Germany, Austria-Hungary, and ezarist Russia,
as a consequence of the war. The flame ol patriotism,
however, burned fiercely within the breasts of the
liberty loving Poles for more than a century of political
submergence, and the memory of the heroic reign of
Sobifeoki was proudly recounted by father to son.
After the war, faced with the Herculean task of
welding the Polish people into political homogeneity
once more, Polish leaders turned almost instinctively
to education as the chief means of attaining their end.
The Poles under German suzerainty had received
fairly good education, but those under the overlord
ship of Vienna and Petrograd hud been grossly ne
glected.
For nearly 20 years Poland has pressed steadily
forward toward a goal of 100 per cent literacy for the
nation, and the results in 1935 are gratifying. Today
more than 4,500,000 children are enrolled in Polish
elementary schools. There are 765 secondary schools,
205 teachers, colleges and 747 professional schools be
sides.
