I had thought' that I was through chronicling the
affairs of the Phi Dolts and the Deegees, but the
pressure of public opinion is strong, so I must out
with the story of Ihe recent week-end escapade on
the front lawn of the local chapter house of Delta
Gamma.
Now it all started when Phi Delta Theta held a
picnic in the wilds of Stanford campus. Upon their
picnic, it seems, they discovered one of the reptilian
suedes and. bringing it hack, interred it upon the front
porch of the local chapter house of Delta Gamma.
It was not the first time that either the D.G.'s or
Phi Delts had seen snakes, hut nonetheless, there wi's
much screaming, yelling, and carrying-on. One of the
Alpha Delt hashers was overcome with emotion at the
thought of the girls' stomachs being upset by anything
Ivi* Ed's food. So he sallied forth to rob the grave of
its burden. The result was that he was enveloped by
a wave of Phi Delts, who deprived him of certain
articles of clothing. While the local chapter of Delta
Gamma snickered on the front porch at the statuary
on the front lawn, the statuary blushed a violent
crimson, and retired from the field. But the whole
proceedings had not yet closed. The Phi Delts turned
against one of thÂ» ir own kind, and concluded the im
promptu affair with dignity by lowering the flag while
the band played on, and a certain varsity pitcher re
treated into the house.
