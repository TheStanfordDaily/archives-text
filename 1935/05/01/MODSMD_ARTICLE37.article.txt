# BULL SESSION
## GOVERNMENT OF, BY, AND FOR 
### 
Student government is like a
I ghost: you don't see it often; and
i when you do, it's positively fright
j ening. In recent weeks, the Glfost
I of the Campus has taken several
| severe drubbings, in the Panel Dis
| cussion ' (most worthwhile forum
held here in many a moon), in the
; Dramatics Council, in Ex Commit
j tee, in Farm Gossip, in Campus
i Opinion—various phases of student
1 government have been called into
j question. Sorely pressed, the Ghost
is wailing—and well it might.
Presumably, student government
! exists primarily for two reasons:
j (1) to perform ccrtain necessary
I functions; (2) to train the future
i voters of the nation in the ways
! and worries of the business of gov
j ernment. (Now take a glass of
1 water.)
One reason hinges in the other.
! For it is apparent that there can be
j not worthwhile training of "the fu
; lure voters of the nation" unless the
! students are called upon to perform
! necessary functions, and are able
|to perform them tolerably well,
i Training in sloppy administration;
j training in the difficult art of "How
I To Second a Motion"; training to be
I puppets is insidious training. And
j unless the lessons of student govern-
I ment are raised to a higher plane
! than that—student government had
I better be junked. Else it turns out
| a group of citizens ready to fill the
I shoes of the least desirable ele
! ments in the political community.
I
The bulk of the business of stu
! dent government is made up of rou
j tine matters of administrative detail,
j far better handled by a few well-
I trained officers of the Administra-
I tion than by students who are le
gitimately bored with the trivia of
Committee action.
Those matters requiring special
| ized knowledge (e.g. Union control,
i B.A.C. matters, play selection and
j management) are also better off, un
tampered with by the superficial
| diddling of collegians. It seems to us
j that the action of the Drama Coun-
{ cil in voting to hand over its func
| tions to the Administration was at
the same time the most commend
able display of self-abnegation and
the most intelligent performance of
student government we have yet
witnessed.

Finally, it appears that joint fac
ulty-student control simply does not
work. The student# bow before what
seems to be superior knowledge,
and if the campus complains of the
action of these joint control boards,
the faculty answer that student rep
resentatives concurred in the voting.
And the buck is effectively passed
on.
; •
We believe that student govern
ment should go, because: (I) it is
inefficient; (2) it is the worst kind
of training for intelligent participa
tion in government, and but serves
to give democracy a black eye; and
(3) it diverts student interest from
worthwhile discussion of the affairs
of the world.
Yes, it is a biological fact that
"The boys and girls of today will be
the men and women of tomorrow,"
but under the benign influence of
student government it is a political
fact that "The boys and girls of to
day will be the boys and girls of
tomorrow."
