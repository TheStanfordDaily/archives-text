THE DAYS OF A MAN" by D«wid

Stanford knows David Starr Jor
dan as the man most personally re
sponsible for the reputation of the
University and its high standing
scholastically. But David Starr Jor
dan was prominent in many more
endeavors than his presidency of
Stanford; he was one of the foremost
scientists, of the country, a well
known writer, and a leader in peace
movements.
"The Days of a Man" is the auto
biography not of a man alone, but of
a man and his accomplishments. It
is a story of the times and troubled
events between the years 1851 and
1921, and as such is a history of the
close of the 19th century and the pe
riod ushering in the World War.
In 1890 he came West and began
his work in building up this Uni
versity, carrying it successfully
through the perilous years following
I the death of Leland Stanford and
following the destruction wrought by
the earthquake in 1906. In 1912 he
resigned active work to become
Chancellor.
But during these years when he
was building up the name of Stan
ford his interests were not bound up
solely in academic work. He was
j representing the United States in
. the Alaskan fishing dispute, and in
i the Newfoundland fishing contro
versy; charting the fish of the Cali
' fornia coast and Japan, touring Eu
{ rope, and writing constantly.
Jordan's greatest work was done
i in the first years of the century, try
: ing to convince a world desperately
! preparing for war of the benefits of
j peace. He served as chairman of
I the World Peace Congress held in
| in 1915, and worked vigorously to
! keep the United States out of war.
| "The Days of a Man" is power
; fully told, expounding Dr. Jordan's
j varied experiences. It reveals little
| of him as a man, but rather shows
j an internationalist with a firm grasp
j on the affairs of Europe and the Far
! East, a man outstanding among his
1 own country's scientists, and a friend
j of the world's leaders.
