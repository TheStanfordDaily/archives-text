# SIDELINE SLANTS
## SLINGER'S DUE FOR A RECORD THROW 
### 
Again the assault on track and
field world's records gets under way.
Last Saturday Bill Graber annexed
the much threatened pole vault
mark with a leap of 14 feet 5%
inches. The day before Jesse Owens,
lowa's dusky flash, eclipsed the
American broad jump mark with 26
feet 1 inch to his credit, and they
say he took off from 7 inches behind
the board! Whether the world's
mark for the four-man one-mile
relay can stand the assaults of the
Stanford and Trojan team next Sat
urday is highly doubted.
But one record which hasn't
even a ghost of a chance of last
ing more than a week or two more
is Harold Anderson's discus toss
of 17 i feet 11 :, /4 inches. Stanford's
Slinger Dunn will he Ihe first to
break it. Last Thursday in Provo
he had it with ;» practice toSs of
172 feet even. After competing in
four strong man events in Sat
urday's competition the Slinger's
hefty right arm didn't have much
left for his favorite event, and a
winning throw of only Kit feet
was the result.
Phil Levy is another Stanford man
now seriously threatening the mark.
For the past few months he has had
a stake out at the 176-foot mark
which he figures to reach before the

year is out. Monday, Levy whipped
one out 163 feet, which puts him
ahead of S.C.'s Kenny Carpenter for
the moment. The' latter's consist
ency will give him the first spot on
the dope sheets of Saturday's meet,
however.

WOULDN'T THE DEAN
LIKE TO KNOW?

Coach Dean Cromwell of the Tro
jans will not talk about his own
team, and a reporter has spare pick
ings around Bovard Field when the
Dean is on hand. Cromwell did go
so far as to name the Coast men
who should figure on the American
team for next year's Olympic
Games, and among them are several
Stanford track figures.
He looks for Eastman to repeat in
the middlp distances, and thinks Al
Blackmail will be among the quarter
inilcrs, along with his own Johnny
McCarthy. He has an all-Stanford
line-up for the shot put, John Ly
man, Gordon Dunn, and Jim Rey
nolds, and fhree Indians, Here La-

Borde, Bob Jones, and Dunn, for the
J discus.
t Bud Deacon is slated for a pole
vault berth on Cromwell's Coast
Olympic contingent, Johnny Mot
tram for one in the javelin, and
Sammy Klopstock for a third in the
i hurdles.
In our estimation Cromwell is
j the peerless suppressor of track
news on the Pacific Coast. But a
little group of newspaper men and
Stanford track men who were out
on Angell Field around 5 o'clock
lrvst Monday afternoon know
something which may give Mr.
Cromwell a heartache of some
kind or other next Saturday. U
j should make a good yarn next
Monday.
