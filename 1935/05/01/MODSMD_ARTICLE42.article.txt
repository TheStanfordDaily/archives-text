# Coast Two-Mile Record Broken By Norm Bright
## 
### 
Nine minutes 22.1 seconds—
the fastest 2-mile e\er run on
the Coast in the memory of the
local track sharks — was the
performance of Norm Bright in
a solo eight laps around the
Angell Field oval.
Bright's achievement, nearly
20 seconds under the Big Meet
mark, was just a teaser to
Coach Dink Templeton, now
trying to scrape together a few
points for the meet with the
Trojans Saturday, for the red
headed distance runner is an
ineligible, having finished his
collegiate competition «t Bel
lingham Normal in Washington
several years ago.
A few of his lap times were
(iO seconds for the first quarter,
4:33 for the mile, and 7:05 for
six laps. Bright's only com
ment was, "My timing was off
today—quite a hit."
