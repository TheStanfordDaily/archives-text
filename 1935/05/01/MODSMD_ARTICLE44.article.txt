# Trojan Track Team Favored Over Cards
## 440-Race Expected To Be Best Event of Meet 
### Warren Breed 
For the first time in several years
Dean Cromwell, the sage of the
South, will bring his Trojans north
j heavily favored to defeat a Stanford
track team Saturday afternoon.
That is, they are heavily favored
unless some stock is taken in the
set-up as presented by Don Lieben
dorfer, Farm news bureau, for Don
, shows that Stanford can win.
But the Trojan victory of 71-60
over California a month ago is an
indication of the strength of the
southern varsity. Cromwell has
I three-deep man-power in every
event but the throws and high
jump.
Liebendorfer's sheei shows that
Warren Dixon, the game little miler,
will have to beat the fastest miler on
ihe Coast, Francis Benavidez, who
ran 4:17 to beat Cal's Heavey. Pro
vision is also made for Sammy Klop
sfock to win both hurdle races '
j against six sweet Trojan performers, j
Don's little "possibility sheet" also I
includes a second place for Ru,sty
March in the half, a clean sweep in ;
the javelin, 14 points in the shot !
and discus, and gives Humbert Smith !
«j and Lloyd Schween 7 points in the
• high jump.
Don is just showing that the
Cards arc in a place to hand the
Trojans a hefty scare: upsets as j
\ioient have been known to hap
i pen on the Coast.
Aside from the possibility of vie- j
j tory, the meet will be eq,ual to any |
! offered to Bay track fans. No less j
than seven duels on track and field |
will see two or more competitors j
! fighting for first place.

Car'thy; Sam Klopstock will run in !

Chuck Nimmo, now a "dark horse" j
on the road back to stardom, meet- !
ing the phenomenal Troy trio of 1
Bush, Cartwright, and Johnson.
Phil Levy, although the "170 |
feet" story was a phony, will be j
meeting husky Ken Carpenter on 1
even terms in the discus, and sev

j feature the meet.
Humbert Smith, who was doing
C feet 4 regularly before falling

For the first time in several years
Dean Cromwell, the sage of the
South, will bring his Trojans north
j heavily favored to defeat a Stanford
track team Saturday afternoon.
That is, they are heavily favored
unless some stock is taken in the
set-up as presented by Don Lieben
dorfer, Farm news bureau, for Don
, shows that Stanford can win.
But the Trojan victory of 71-60
over California a month ago is an
indication of the strength of the
southern varsity. Cromwell has
I three-deep man-power in every
event but the throws and high
jump.
Liebendorfer's sheei shows that
Warren Dixon, the game little miler,
will have to beat the fastest miler on
ihe Coast, Francis Benavidez, who
ran 4:17 to beat Cal's Heavey. Pro
vision is also made for Sammy Klop
sfock to win both hurdle races '
j against six sweet Trojan performers, j
Don's little "possibility sheet" also I
includes a second place for Ru,sty
March in the half, a clean sweep in ;
the javelin, 14 points in the shot !
and discus, and gives Humbert Smith !
«j and Lloyd Schween 7 points in the
• high jump.
Don is just showing that the
Cards arc in a place to hand the
Trojans a hefty scare: upsets as j
\ioient have been known to hap
i pen on the Coast.
Aside from the possibility of vie- j
j tory, the meet will be eq,ual to any |
! offered to Bay track fans. No less j
than seven duels on track and field |
will see two or more competitors j
! fighting for first place.
One of the best races will see A1 |
« Blackmail battling with Johnny Mc- j
Car'thy; Sam Klopstock will run in !
iwo close hurdle races; Dixon will 1
meet Benavidez; Rusty March and \
Chuck Nimmo, now a "dark horse" j
on the road back to stardom, meet- !
ing the phenomenal Troy trio of 1
Bush, Cartwright, and Johnson.
Phil Levy, although the "170 |
feet" story was a phony, will be j
meeting husky Ken Carpenter on 1
even terms in the discus, and sev

j feature the meet.
Humbert Smith, who was doing
C feet 4 regularly before falling
and spraining his ankle is still re

injury is the only definite incapacity
