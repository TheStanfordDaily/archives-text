The Editor, Sir:
Better than asking the Daily edi
tor, or Campus Opinion fans, as to
which student body offices are held
by graduate and which are not, yes
terday's Robleite correspondent in
these columns could have consulted
the little red Handbook with which
she was presented when she entered
Stanford last fall. Having himself
just this quarter received one of
these little books, the writer can
assure her that there, among other
things, she would have found a re
production of the constitution of the
Associated Students. However, since
the question was asked, Roble must
by all means be informed.
According to the constitution, all
members of the "Associated Stu
dents of Stanford University," grad
uates and undergraduates, are eli
gible to hold any one of the offices
of the association. This means that
the offices of president, vice-presi
dent, and student manager may all
be held by graduates. Of the Execu
tive Committee of nine, at least two
and at most three members may be
graduates. Of the three student
members of the Board of Athletic
Control, all three may be graduates;
the same holds for the Union Board
of Governors. Likewise, all mem
bers of both the Men's and Women's
Councils could legally be graduate
students.
Perhaps it may seem strange to
those who live in Roble that such a
preponderance of the student body
offices may be filled by graduates.
This was undoubtedly provided by
the constitution because students
who spent four years at college are
supposedly better fitted, through the
experience they have gained, to
guide student affairs. Having been
'through the mill" they know what
it is all about.
Hoping this may help clear up at
least one of the numerous weighty
problems which tax the walls of
Roble, I am,
Sincerely,
Ralph Raymond
