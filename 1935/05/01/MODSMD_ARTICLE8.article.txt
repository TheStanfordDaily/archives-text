# TWAIN PRAISED BY ELLSWORTH
## Author's Rise To Universal Fame Told by Friend 
### Barbara Sweet 
With a rich flow of anecdote con
cerning Mark Twain that delighted
the good-sized Assembly Hall au
dience, William W. Ellsworth, noted
lecturer and friend of the great au
thor, last night described the rise of
a poor country boy to universal ac
claim as America's foremost humor
ist.
Slides picturing every phase of
Twain's life were thrown on the
screen, as well as many scenes de
scribed in the author's hooks.
Ellsworth remarked especially on
Twain's love of tall stories. Through
cut his entire life he always had
difficulty in limiting himself to the
strict truth. He once said that he
could not remember when he told
his first lie, but he remembered his
second when he was nine days old.
Although in his later years,
Twain's royalties were very large,
the humorist had a penchant for
risking his money on new inven
tions and several times lost every
thing in these wild ventures.
His losses taught him a lesson,
however, for after sinking $200,000 in
an unsuccessful type-setting ma
chine he refused to buy 500 shares
at $5 a share in a company estab
lished by Alexander Graham Bell,
formed to produce "that toy," the
telephone.
Toward the end of his life, Twain
was forced to go on a lecture tour
around the world in order to pay
these delats.
