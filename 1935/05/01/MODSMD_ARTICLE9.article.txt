# Senior Group Collects Money for Scholarship
## 
### 
Pledges totalling approximately '
| $200 have already been taken, in by
; the senior endowment committee j
| under the chairmanship of Gordon
| Mallatratt. The committee is at
I present contacting seniors to secure ;
i the pledges, and will concentrate the j
! money into a lasting scholarship !
! fund.
Unlike an ordinary gift to the Uni- I
versity, this fund will not form a J
j scholarship for a single year only, !
I but will be a continual fund sup- j
| ported by the contributions as they j
j come in from year to year. Seniors :
are pledging various'amounts for!
i any number of years. The pledges I
| are not binding, and may be in- '
j creased or decreased at any time the |
j graduate wishes.
