After every climax there must be
| 3 falling off. Last flight's reading of
G. B. Shaw's "The Devil's Disciple"
was that falling off, coming as it did
after the 42nd anniversary reading
!of "The Insect Comedy."
j Which is not to say that "The
Devil's Disciple" was not good cn
| tcrtainment. It was. James Benet,
j Carter Myer, and Caroline House
! nvrn repeated former successes in
their roles in last night's produc
tion. Phyllis Corson even rose
i above her portrayal in "Fear."
But Tom Seller and Rosemary
Benet were not quite as good as
' they have been in the past, perhaps
j because their parts were somewhat
J different than those in which they
j have been so popular.
Shaw's play, one of his earlier
works, can best be described as "a
melodrama with comedy." Highly
dramatic in plot, the tenseness of
the situation was frequently re
lieved with shafts of Shavian wit.
The play did not, however, carry a
"social message," as so many of
1 the author's later works do.
Dick Dawson was responsible for
i the direction of the reading, which
was, on the whole, capable.
