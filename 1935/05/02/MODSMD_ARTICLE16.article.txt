# Soviet Warriors Display Strength To Russ Chiefs
## May Day Celebration Seen As Stalin's Answer To Reich Armament Russians Fear War Danger On Frontiers 
### 
MOSCOW, May 1 (/P).â€”The Soviet
million man fighting machine poured
gray-coated warriors through Red
Square today in a display of strength
which Bolshevik leaders said was an
answer to German armaments.
Wave upon wave of soldiers
passed before Joseph Stalin and
nearly 700 military planes zoomed
overhead in the most imposing dis
play Russia ever has given of her
aerial power.
Stalin Approves
"War danger has obliged us to in
crease strength of our frontiers,"
Klement Voroshiloff, commissar for
defense, told the marching men.
"The principal desire of Soviet Rus
sia is peace for the whole world."
Stalin, dictator of the nation,
smiled and waved his approval from
a reviewing stand on Lenin's tomb.
The troops, standing at attention
before the parade, heard Voroshiloff
assert: "Our country is doing ev
erything possible to prevent war and
our strong army appears to be the
best argument to this end. If war
is imposed upon us, the enemy will
find there is a difference between
the Czar's army and our red army."
Air Parade Large
"If war is imposed upon us," he
said again, "the enemy will get ac
quainted with our red army. They
must reproach themselves if that ac
quaintance is distasteful."
The air parade included all types
of airplane, from giant bombers to
swift pursuit ships. The air force,
which had been something of a
mystery due to the fact figures in
dicating its actual strength have
rarely been published, brought out
for public display fast bimotored
bombers with retractable landing
gear, which flew low over heads of
spectators at impressive speed.
Foreign observers counted approx
imately 400 biplane fighting ma
chines and 135 heavy bombers.
