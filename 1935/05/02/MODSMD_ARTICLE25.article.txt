# Jolly- Up Ends Week of Home Drive Activity
## Student Laborers Clean Up Grounds; Climax Work With Big Barbecue 
### Irvin Jorgensen 
Following the back-to-thc-farm
movement in a realistic way, the
Stanford campus adjourned en
masse to the Convalescent Home
! yesterday and grappled with the
I elements in order to set the 26-acrc
I property to rights. Liibor Day and
| the all-University jolly-up in the
j Pavilion last night were the climax
| of a week and a half jammed with
| the activity of the Convalescent
! Home Drive.
Pitching in with a carefree
spirit, Stanford roughs, those who
are heirs to fortunes as well as
those who arc heirs only to diver
sity, worked with a zest and a zeal
before the watching Convalescent
children, who thrilled to the activ
ity of the students and the music
provided by the Stanford band.
Speaking with the wisdom of his
; years, Will Eisner, head of the drive,
I when cornered at the jolly-up, said,
| "Labor Day went off in the smooth
! est. way it ever has," and compli
! mented Mill _ Luhmann, Labor Day
; chairman, and his many hard-work
, ing helpers.
Entertainment Provided
The barliecue of fatted lamb pre
! pared by veteran Sam McDonald
was received by the many pro
! digious sons and daughters of the
Stanford Red, who were also enter-
I tained by Dick Creamer's program.
Though A. James Copp 111 was in
; volved with the measles epidemic,
his spirit marched on in the persons
of Barbara Pat ton, Terry Hirsch
field, soloists; Pete Knecht, Norman
Sears, Wally Baird, and Fred Nagel,
| quartetists; Ernie Heckscher, ban
i joist; Don Geggie, guitarist; Ann
' Bartlett and Elizabeth Rhodes, piano
duetists; and Doodles Weaver,
I screweyist.
Dance Is Free
Last night's free jolly-up was of
fered as a compliment and a reward
to students for their work in assur
' ing the success of the drive.
Bill Lowe, jolly-up chairman, ex
tended his thanks to Eddie Stirm's
orchestra for donating its services,
| and making the free jolly-up pos
j sible.
j GifT Myers, treasurer, is still
. struggling with long lists of figures,
I so he Is unable to announce the final
j results of this year's drive, but he
; is sure that a new high will be
t reached.
