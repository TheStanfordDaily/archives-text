Rogers Chairman
According to Dave MellinkofT and

participated in a formal afTair at

and dignity. On their arrival here,
the Canadian speakers were sur
prised to learn that the wearing of
the traditional gown was not an
American custom.
Rogers will preside as chairman
tonight. Judges will be former
Judge Egerton D. Lakin of Palo Alto,
Lieut.-Commander Stewart F. Bry
ant, and the Rev. D. Charles Gard
ner, chaplain of the University.

Chaplain Gardner today and pre
ceding the debate tonight, the Stan
