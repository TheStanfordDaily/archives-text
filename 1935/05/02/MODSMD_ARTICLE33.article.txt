# Campus Dances; We Still Have Them at Stanford
## 
### 
For the first time in a number of years,
dances on the Farm litis spring quarter seem
to be sulVering from a drought, So far as at
tendance is concerned.
II may be the impression of transfers, fresh
men, and some of the more sophisticated in
dividuals on the campus that these dances are
given merely because it is a tradition for such
an event to lie held yearly on a certain dale.
This is not true.
Campus dances serve useful purposes. The
bigger ones such as the Sophomore Cotillion,
the Junior From, and the Senior Mall are class
affairs, designed to bring members of each
class together for one big function of the year.
However, there are many other dances given
by the dormitories, or under A.S.S.I', spon
sorship.
These dances are set up with definite budg
ets, and require intensive, preparation. Their
value lies in the opportunities of acquainting
people from all over the campus, and they are
designed to keep students on the Farm where
the expense of city entertainment and hazard
of automobile travel are absent.
Stanford dances are given primarily for the
students themselves, and provide .'ill the req
uisites for a good time, with probably the best
campus orchestras available anywhere, ex
cellent lighting and decorating effects, and
the advantage of being somewhere where
there are college acquaintances rather than
the usual city hotel with the rat-racing evils
of a crowded ballroom.
For this reason alone, campus dances de
serve to be patronized by the students on the
campus, before a continuous loss of money
inav result in their elimination.
