# Hell Week Is Tottering
## 
### 
Fourteen of Stanford's fraternities have
adopted the Interfraternitv Board's anti Mell
Week plan, a progressive move which will
bring local Greeks into line with many other
campuses in ruling <)l 't excessive initiation
practices.
Quick action hv the others will bring Stan
ford into the category of a few other colleges
where students have taken this sensible action
on their own.initiative, without a faculty ride
being necessary.
An interesting contrast is found in Los An
geles, where Hell Week iias been banned both
at t'.S.C. and U.C.L.A. The difference lies in
the fact that F.S.C.. fraternities look no action
on their own responsibility, but were greeted
with an edict to that effect from the president
<>l the university. At 1 1 .C.1,.A. the interfrater
nitv council, profiting by experience gained
when two pledges were seriously injured a
few months ago, took matters into their own
bands and decisively banned rough initiation
practices without official assistance.
The ten fraternities here which have not vet
indorsed the plan will meet Monday night to
consider it. Definite action on this measure
will clear up the present argument, at the
same time adopting a definite policy to be in
force before present pledges are initialed.
