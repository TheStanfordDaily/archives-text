# Graduates in Activities?
## 
### 
With the blowing over of the Masque Ball
controversy which filled the Campus Opinion
column for days, another storm breaks un
dergraduates versus graduates for student
body positions. The argument, however, is
not new. It is as old as the t Diversity.
Fnderclassmen claim that student body of
fices are for them, not for the graduate. The
graduate, the contention goes, should spend
bis time on his studies â€” that's why he came
back to Stanford and if he was not good
enough during his four years, he should not
attempt to hold any such offices.
The student who returns for advanced stud
ies, however, advances the point that he is a
part of a group which comprises about one
tourlh of the enrollment, that his experience
is greater than that of the underclassman, and
that his interests do not change merely be
cause he has attended commencement.
The quibbling between the two groups
dodges the issue. It is not a question of under
graduate versus graduate but of the best and
most capable man for the office versus medi
ocre possibilities.
