## PROPAGANDA AND PROFESSORS: HAND 
### CEDRIC LARSON 
The once-popular aphorism, "The government is
best that governs least," seems rapidly to be going the
way of the dodo, while the highly paternalistic state
with its planned economy flourishes. Hardly a day
passes without some new duty or power over the lives
of its citizens being added to the state. With freedom
of press and speech growing more restricted, the role
of the teacher in academic institutions becomes a more
important one.
Was Glenn Frank, president of the University of
Wisconsin, right when he recently said that "teachers
must be neither propagandists nor neutrals"? Should
the professor be silent or neutral with respect to po
litically controversial issues? Or should he be a propa
gandist for his own particular views?
Dr. Harold C. Hand of the School of Education, who
has made a careful study of this vital question from
the viewpoint of the educator, says:
"If the university is to serve American democ
racy, it dare not be silent or neutral with refer
ence to controversial issues touching denials of
those values or aspirations which constitute the
very essence of our democracy. It would appear
axiomatic that a university which would serve
democracy can never permit itself to be indiffer
ent to the purposes of democracy. Rather, it must
work increasingly for the realization of these
purposes."
This does not mean that instructors should propa
gandize for one or the other of numerous panaceas,
pet schemes and blue-print solutions. It does mean,
however, that silence must not be looked upon as neu
trality. Silence regarding issues touching denials of
mass well-being, freedom to believe as one will in
economic and political mattei's, freedom of assembly
and speech, equality before the law, and the like, is
NOT neutrality, but rather an assent to the forces
which are operating to deny or to threaten the value
in question, the educator points out.
The democratic university should recognize its
mandatory obligation to draw attention to all such
denials and lead its students to study honestly and
fearlessly all suggested alternative remedies for any
conditions in which values or aspirations connoted by
the term "American democracy" are jeopardized.
"The modification, in the service of the general
welfare, of outmoded social controls inherited from
a preindustrial society is a task of great magni
tude," declares Dr. Hand. "It is. moreover, a task
which must be accomplished if American democ
racy is to survive its present severe crisis. It
makes imperative an educational theory and prac
tice closely harmonized with the realities and pos
sibilities of American life."
Freedom of speech and freedom of press are two
of the foundation stones upon which liberal democracy
rests. When these twin privileges fall upon evil days
the meaning of American liberty is undermined. And
academic freedom, the right to instruct the plastic
mind of youth with criteria of discrimination on all
controversial issues, is a corollary of both freedom of
speech and press, the educator holds.

gandize for one or the other of numerous panaceas,
pet schemes and blue-print solutions. It does mean,
however, that silence must not be looked upon as neu
trality. Silence regarding issues touching denials of
mass well-being, freedom to believe as one will in
economic and political mattei's, freedom of assembly
and speech, equality before the law, and the like, is
NOT neutrality, but rather an assent to the forces
which are operating to deny or to threaten the value
in question, the educator points out.
The democratic university should recognize its
mandatory obligation to draw attention to all such
denials and lead its students to study honestly and
fearlessly all suggested alternative remedies for any
conditions in which values or aspirations connoted by
the term "American democracy" are jeopardized.
"The modification, in the service of the general
welfare, of outmoded social controls inherited from
a preindustrial society is a task of great magni
tude," declares Dr. Hand. "It is. moreover, a task
which must be accomplished if American democ
racy is to survive its present severe crisis. It
makes imperative an educational theory and prac
tice closely harmonized with the realities and pos
sibilities of American life."
Freedom of speech and freedom of press are two
of the foundation stones upon which liberal democracy
rests. When these twin privileges fall upon evil days
the meaning of American liberty is undermined. And
academic freedom, the right to instruct the plastic
mind of youth with criteria of discrimination on all
controversial issues, is a corollary of both freedom of
speech and press, the educator holds.
The once-popular aphorism, "The government is
best that governs least," seems rapidly to be going the
way of the dodo, while the highly paternalistic state
with its planned economy flourishes. Hardly a day
passes without some new duty or power over the lives
of its citizens being added to the state. With freedom
of press and speech growing more restricted, the role
of the teacher in academic institutions becomes a more
important one.
Was Glenn Frank, president of the University of
Wisconsin, right when he recently said that "teachers
must be neither propagandists nor neutrals"? Should
the professor be silent or neutral with respect to po
litically controversial issues? Or should he be a propa
gandist for his own particular views?
Dr. Harold C. Hand of the School of Education, who
has made a careful study of this vital question from
the viewpoint of the educator, says:
"If the university is to serve American democ
racy, it dare not be silent or neutral with refer
ence to controversial issues touching denials of
those values or aspirations which constitute the
very essence of our democracy. It would appear
axiomatic that a university which would serve
democracy can never permit itself to be indiffer
ent to the purposes of democracy. Rather, it must
work increasingly for the realization of these
purposes."

gandize for one or the other of numerous panaceas,
pet schemes and blue-print solutions. It does mean,
