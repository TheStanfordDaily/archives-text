# OUR HASHER SEZ:
## 
### 
A tale of triumoh in a struggle against 'remendous
odds is interwoven with the recent measles cataclysm.
It is a tale of tremendous thirst of terror, privation, and
alma martyrdom.
It is of the valiant class of '38 that I sing. A noble
freshman youth, though of humble birlh, was stricken
from the records by an attack of the measely mea.slies,
and incarcerated in the local bastille. As many suns
and moons followed each other, the humble youth of
noble origin was stricken by drought, and held an
informal dust storm on his palate of straw.
He decided that this would never do, and it didn't.
He cudgelled his wits to think up some way to get
word out of his donjon-keep for a rescue, and sum
marily asked his nurse if he might send out for a
book to read. He forthwith penned a tender missive
to his room-mate to wit: "Please bring out to me
Volume 10 of 'Golden Glow'." The note way dis
patched with dispatch, and the result was that outside
of the donjon-keep there stood a genii, holding in his
grasp ten bottles. Improvising a rope made out of a
bathrobe belt, the imprisoned worthy straightway ele
vated the glassware to the level of his window, and
proceeded to hide the evidence. The evidence hiddn,
the prisoner was satisfied, and th nurse surprised, the
next morning, to find the ten empty volumes of
"Golden Glow" doing the dance of the dead soldiers
on the floor.
President Marvie, keeper of the peace in the council
chamber burst forth recently with a lively statement
that turned turtle, or something. "You haven't had a
meeting since the last one?" asked he. To which state
ment Drama Manager Frank replied with an emphatic
"No."
A friendly word of warning to former student man

A friendly word of warning to present stud® man

saddest is, 'it might have, Ben.' "

A friendly word of warning to readers of this
potpourri who think Our Hasher is the chief scandal
dog-in-the-monger of the campus:
Only Stevie and Aten
Know who's datin'.
A tale of triumoh in a struggle against 'remendous
odds is interwoven with the recent measles cataclysm.
It is a tale of tremendous thirst of terror, privation, and
alma martyrdom.
It is of the valiant class of '38 that I sing. A noble
freshman youth, though of humble birlh, was stricken
from the records by an attack of the measely mea.slies,
and incarcerated in the local bastille. As many suns
and moons followed each other, the humble youth of
noble origin was stricken by drought, and held an
informal dust storm on his palate of straw.
He decided that this would never do, and it didn't.
He cudgelled his wits to think up some way to get
word out of his donjon-keep for a rescue, and sum
marily asked his nurse if he might send out for a
book to read. He forthwith penned a tender missive
to his room-mate to wit: "Please bring out to me
Volume 10 of 'Golden Glow'." The note way dis
patched with dispatch, and the result was that outside
of the donjon-keep there stood a genii, holding in his
grasp ten bottles. Improvising a rope made out of a
bathrobe belt, the imprisoned worthy straightway ele
vated the glassware to the level of his window, and
proceeded to hide the evidence. The evidence hiddn,
the prisoner was satisfied, and th nurse surprised, the
next morning, to find the ten empty volumes of
"Golden Glow" doing the dance of the dead soldiers
on the floor.
President Marvie, keeper of the peace in the council
chamber burst forth recently with a lively statement
that turned turtle, or something. "You haven't had a
meeting since the last one?" asked he. To which state
ment Drama Manager Frank replied with an emphatic
"No."
A friendly word of warning to former student man
ager Hables: "Your sinus will find you out."
A friendly word of warning to present stud® man
ager Cave: "Of all the words of tongue and pen. the
saddest is, 'it might have, Ben.' "
