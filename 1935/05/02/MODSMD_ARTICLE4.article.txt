# Dink Loses Hope As Track Squad Plans Surprises
## 'Come-Through' of Former Seasons Remains Single Chance Possible Victors of Events Are Named

"Just get a lot of track suits from
j Yale, Harvard, Princeton, and Dart-
I mouth, divide them up among the
I Trojan track men, count the points
! according to colors, and we'd make
] a darn good showing."
This came from Robert Lyman
i Templeton, who directs track and
i field activities for Stanford these
I days, in one of his many pessimistic
moments lately, as his Cardinals
prepare to come through against
U.S.C. Saturday, something on the
order of the way they did two years
ago.
'"Sure," Dink added, "figured on
; that basis, we might even win the
[ meet."
Indians IVla.v Win
But although it sounds quite ridic
j ulous after a slight perusal of com
parative scores and a few other little
things, Stanford's track men, togeth
er with publicity man Don Lieben
dorfer, think the Indians might win,
even though the officials do put all
the points gathered by students in
attendance at the University of
Southern California in one column.
There is but one reason for saying
Stanford might beat S.C.: The In
dians have a habit of coming through
in one meet during the year; last
year it was against California, two
years ago it was against Troy. Both
of those two incidents happened in
the Stanford Stadium, so the stage
is set for another afternoon of over
head performances.
May Capture Events
Here are some of the possibilities
for your "come through" artists:
1. Ray Dean—a couple of seconds
in the sprints and a place in the
broad jump. Everyone figures Dean
Cromwell's men for a clean sweep
in the jumping event, but Dean
stepped out beyond 24 feet at Berke
ley two weeks ago, and he is some
thing of a competitor.
2. Lloyd Schween — a second or
first in the high jump. Humbert
Smith's leg is still a bit wobbly, but
Schween first gained prominence as
a sophomore in the S.C. meet two
years ago by leaping 6 feet 4 inches.
He hasn't beaten 6 feet this year, but
is habitually in top form for the
Trojans.
3. Chuck Nimmo or Rusty March
—a place in the 880, generally con
ceded another Trojan shutout. There
may be a surprise package here.
4. Warren Dixon—first place in
the mile. He ran those 13's of Bob
Heavey's into the ground two weeks
ago. He's a clever runner, particu
larly in the last lap.
5. Dave Devlin — lots of nerve,
maybe No. 1 in the two-mile, in
spite of Fred Lantz, who has a bit
better record. Devlin is a good com
petitor; Lantz is inconsistent.
G. Al Hershey — a comer, may
place in both weights.
7. Phil Levy—can beat Ken Car
penter in the discus; may even place
in the shot and make it a sweep for
Stanford.
8. Bill Bcatty—may combine with
Johnny Mottram and Dud Sales to
sweep the javelin. •
