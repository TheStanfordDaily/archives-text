The Editor, Sir:
One-fourth of the students at
Stanford are graduates, paying the
same dues as undergraduates. To
restrict their constitutional privi
leges might easily lead to their
withdrawal from the A.S.S.U. (they
were admitted in 1926) which would
cut the income of the association by
a quarter and work a grave injus
tice on those who possess an A.B.
It is difficult to understand why
this degree makes a great differ
ence in a possible office holder.
When students return for advanced
degrees their life and interests have
not changed suddenly; they are only
three months away from their sen
ior year. Young, experienced, inter
ested in student affairs, they may
very possibly have the qualities
requisite for office.
As years pass, natural forces op
erate. Acquaintances become fewer
as work piles up; undergraduate
fame falls away and interest in and
ability to be elected to student body
office vanishes. It therefore seems
highly unnecessary and wholly in
equitable to prevent graduate mem
bers of the A.S.S.U. from merely
being eligible for office.

The Editor, Sir;
The Daily in its capacity of right
ing the wrongs of the universe in
general and of the Stanford campus
in particular has overlooked one,
great injustice.
We have all heard often enough of
the poor food at Encina and the fu
tile attempts to secure breakfast
refunds. Apparently the obstacles
are insurmountable and so have

j been relegated to undercurrent !
I gripes. |
j Why hasn't anything been said j
| about the plight of the gals at the j
I Union, etc., who not only are forced i
jto eat University food all during ;
their campus careers at exorbitant
prices, but also must endure the
total absence of any refund what- i
soever?
If the University in its capacity of
guardian to the lives and morals of !
| its girlies sees fit to restrict their
i dining to its own domains, why
j doesn't it at least make the food
, adequate?
We are hoping for immediate ac
tion on your part not only for the
I sake of the poor starving girls, but
; also for us (those susceptible males)
j who must forever feed them at odd
| hours, either on or off the campus.
