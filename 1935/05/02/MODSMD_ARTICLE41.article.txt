# BULL SESSION
## ARGUMENT IN ACADEMICS 
### 
From beyond the Canadian-Ainer
( ican boundary — demilitarized long
i since by Ku>h and Bagot — have
come two visiting British Colum
! bian debaters. Speaking excellent
English and tolerable American, the
University of British Columbia men
have girded themselves to defend
the proposition: "Resolved, that
Japan's policies in the Orient
j should be approved."
Striking a note of uplift in cam
| pus forensics, participants in the
1 debate (both Canadians and Amer
icans) will appear in academic
1 gowns. Long a custom in Canada,
the wearing of black robes for a
! debate has never before been at
tempted on the Farm. Primarily
because Stanford debaters have
! hitherto lacked the moral courage
i to face a Stanford audience in the
, robes ordinarily reserved for grad-
J uates and corpses,
i
Of course, in addition to robes, the
men will wear the generally accepted
i tuxedos. That is also an old Can
adian custom. It was thought best
that the wearing of academics be
introduced on the campus in *the
j course of an international debate.
For International Law will now pro
j tect the debaters from the wrath of
i the Stanford rough, who can be
i made to respect little short of diplo
' matic immunity.
As we learned to our pleasure a
'month ago, the Canadians are mer
cilessly splendid debaters. With the
suavity of the practiced parliamen
tarian, they are able to pass off re
i marks that would precipiate hand
to-hand combat, if offered any
place else but on the debate plat
form. The man who started the fable
j about the slowness of British wit
I must have been deaf and dumb, and
I very possibly blind.

I By now the Canadians have been
| "duly impressed" with the Stanford
1 campus. They have seen the Chapel,
Lagunita, and have tasted of Union
1 food. Even the last did not phase
i them. They still want to debate. But
apparently the thing that impressed
I the visitors most was the Chaparral.
After getting the low-down from
j Chappy, they immediately wanted
to meet some Stanford women.
The U.B.C. speakers have the
' tough side of a rip-snorting ques
i tion. And it. will be interesting to
see if even Canadians can make a
; plausible case for Japanese imperial
ism. II it is at all possible, the
Canadians will do- it. In robes, in
| soup-and-fish, in the Little Theater,
they take their stand.

As we learned to our pleasure a

cilessly splendid debaters. With the

tarian, they are able to pass off re

place else but on the debate plat
form. The man who started the fable

I By now the Canadians have been

Lagunita, and have tasted of Union

apparently the thing that impressed
I the visitors most was the Chaparral.
After getting the low-down from

to meet some Stanford women.

they take their stand.
