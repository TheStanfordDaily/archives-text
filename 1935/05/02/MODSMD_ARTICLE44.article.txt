## IT'S AS GOOD AS IT EVER WAS 
### 
Stanford and U.S.C., two of the
strongest track teams in the coun
try, will stage their ?nnual meet
Saturday in the stadium, and the in
terest in the event is on a par with
that for a local fencing match.
No more than two years ago the
northern California sport world
anticipated the Trojan - Indian
clash for weeks. It ws the big
track event of the year. Then
* Brutus Hamilton brought Cali
fornia back, and the Big Meet is
the one the fans are most inter
ested in. This year the California
Intercollegiates, Fresno Relays,
and N.C.A.A. will all have a larger
following than Saturday's affair.
Probably the most thrilling meet
in the memory of the present Stan
ford generation was a U.S.C.-Stan
ford meet. It was two years ago,
when the Trojans were in their
prime with a well-rounde d team be
sides the usual ace performers.
Stanford was given about as much
of an outside edge as they are this
year, and that only on the condi
tion that a few of the cripples could
appear.
The Indians were handicapped by
the mental hazard of four years of
defeat; by the actual loss of two
quarter milers, Ben Eastman and
Don Blackman, and one sprinter,
Jimmy Wilson; by the injuries of
sprinter Les Hables and pole vault
ers Bill Miller and Bud Deacon.

a series of come through perform
ances that h"pn't been duplicated
since. Les Hables started the up
set when he forgot his ailments
and whipped out in the last 20
yards of the hundred to win from
the favorite in 9.7 seconds. Sopho
more Lloyd Schween finished it
when he defeated two Olympic
veterans to win the high jump.
The Stanford hurdlers came
through. A couple of unknown
Card broadjumpers placed one
two ahead of the S.C. favorites.
Bill Miller vaulted 13 feet (> inches
for second despite his heel bruise.
The 1935 Stanford-Southern Cali
fornia meet fulfills the first half of
this upset: the Indians are definitely
the short enders. No one has yet
ventured the belief that they can
turn the trick as the 1935 squad did.
