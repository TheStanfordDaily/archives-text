# BIG THREE MAKE RIGHT-ABOUT-FACE
## 
### 
A few months ago Stanford, Cali
fornia, and Southern California
were "definitely" not going to the
1.C.4-A. It's an amusing right-about
face that finds them all going now.
Coach Dean Cromwell told his
Trojans in a pre-meet pep talk that
they could go if they beat the Bears,
and they did. California, basking in
the glory of new-found track
strength and an enthusiastically re
ceived season climaxed by the Stan
ford rout, decided to send a squad.
The Stanford 8.A.C.. in contrast
with its earlier downcast looks at
the mention of the coffers, suddenly
found that they did have the money,
and authorized eastern trips for
three teams.
No one doubts that the three
western schools will again domi
nate the 1.C.4-A. meet three weeks
off. The question is: which one?
The Daily California doped it out
as follows: U.S.C., 49 points; Cali
fornia, 47; Stanford, 33. And a sar
castic "Oh, yeah!" must be par
doned.
