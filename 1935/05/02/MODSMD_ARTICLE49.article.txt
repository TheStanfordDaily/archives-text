# SQUAD TO RESUME SCRIMMAGE AFTER TWO-DAY VACATION
## 
### 
Tiny Thornhill's spring gridmen
have enjoyed a two-day lay-off this
week but today and tomorrow they
are slated to pay for their short va
cation, according to Tiny.
Thornhill plans to run his men
through their new formations this
afternoon and then top the week
off with a tough scrimmage session
Friday.
For the past month the head foot
ball mentor has been teaching his
squad of nearly 70 aspiring ball tot
ers and line smashers the six or
seven fundamental plays of his sys
tem, just"enough to have one for
each hole when he sets his men to
extensive scrimmaging.
Next week the squad will work
out four days a week instead of
the usual three and Tiny believes
that with the blessing of Old Sol
and a dry field he will have his
varsity te"\m for 19:55' mapped out
in good style by the end of the
month.
The termination of the frosh track
season put half a dozen cindermen
into the spring football ranks but as
yet Tiny hasn't been given sufficient
chance to observe the new men in
action to comment on their potential
varsity qualities.
