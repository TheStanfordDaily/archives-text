### 
Northwestern University at Ev
| anston, 111., will probably be the
j site of the annual intercollegiate ten
nis tournament, according to news
J received by the Stanford Board of
J Athletic Control. The date is un
j certain, but vfill most likely be in
j late June, after finals are over.
The number of men that Stanford
will send is not yet known, but the
J full six-man team of Captain Sam
i Lee, John Law, Ben Dey, Bill
j Seward, Jack Lynch, and Bob Pom
i mer may go. Some of these players
j will probably go on to the Sea
; bright and Newport tourneys on the
I Atlantic Coast after the intercol
legiates.
Two years ago was the last time
J the Card netsters entered the tour
nament. Lee and Joe Coughlin, 1933
captain, won Ihe doubles champion
j ship at that time. Since the Indians
'have. swept all their conference
J matches with no trouble, they should
; have a good chance in national com
! petition.
