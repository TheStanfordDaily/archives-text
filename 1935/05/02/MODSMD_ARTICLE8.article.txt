# HOUSES BALLOT ON HELL WEEK
## 14 Fraternities Vote To Ban Hazing at Initiations 
### 
With 14 houses already on record
as favoring the abolition of rough
initiations, Interfraternity Council
members will carry the Greek anti-
Hell Week plan to the other 10
houses this week for final decision.
If the plan is approved, many ini
tiation practices now carried on will
disappear, giving way to customs
which are considered more con
structive and not so dangerous to
the health and scholarship of the
pledge.
"Quests," paddling, all-night ac
tivities. ,'-\nd other phases of the
initiations which have drawn
down sophomore scholarship and
injured the health of many pledges,
appear doomed under the approval
which the plan has been meeting
in most groups.
The action was initiated after a
survey had been made of sophomore
scholarship during fall quarters,
and reports had been received from
the Health Service about injuries
and sickness suffered by fraternity
pledges.
The results, together with testi
mony of fraternity members, indi
cated that Hell Week was definitely
detrimental, and that without, com
pletely cancelling customary in
formal initiations, some steps should
be taken to improve methods.
