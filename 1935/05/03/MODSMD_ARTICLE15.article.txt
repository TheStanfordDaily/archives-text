baters from the University of British
Columbia won a 2-1 judges' deci
sion from a Stanford team in the
' year's last campus debate at the
; Little Theater last night.
Garbed in the academic robes
which all participants wore, Frank
j Miller ami John Gould of (he Ca
! n.'»dian institution out-pointed
; Stanford's Henry Lowenstein and
j Jackson Wheeler on the proposi
j tion, "Resolved, that Japan's poli
| cies in the Orient should he ap
; proved."
The arguments of the affirmative
rested on Japan's assertion of the
! "Monroe Doctrine of the Orient" and
I the justification of Japan's action re*
i garding Manchuria. Contending tb.it
Japan was burdened with economic
and increasing birth-rate problems,
Gould and Miller showed that Jap
an's entry into Manchuria helped to
1 relieve the problems, and at the
| same time bettered conditions for all
| concerned.
Conquest of Starvation
Regarding the Kellogg - Briand
Pact which the negative accused
Japan of breaking, the Canadians
countered with the statement that
"Japan had the choice of breaking
the covenant or committing suicide.
Japan entered Manchuria instead of
starving."
Lowenstein and Wheeler forward
ed their stand on Japan's policy of
"imperialism by force.'' Annexing
Korea from an originally independ
ent state v/as indicated by the nega
tive as Japan's expression of im
perialism and dominance over Asiat
ic affairs. Manchuria, especially, was
subject to close scrutiny during the
course of the evening. * M

British influence, was in evi
dence. The Canadians referred to
the "worthy opponents" as the
"honorable gentlemen of the op
posite," «,nd the traditional black
gown made its first Stanford ap
pearance at a debate. A distinctly
British custom, the academics,
which were loaned by the Board
of Trustees, emburdened the
Cardinal debaters, (hough the vis
itors appeared quite at home in
the bulky robes.
All arrangements for this third
Stanford-British Columbia debate on
the campus were made by Debate
Manager Bob Gros, who acted as
official host to the Canadians.
