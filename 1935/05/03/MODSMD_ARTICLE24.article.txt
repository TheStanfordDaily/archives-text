# Cards Hope For Upset as U. S. C. Plans Easy Win
## Trojans Arrive Tomorrow Morning for Annual Meet; Klopstock, Blackman, Levy Up Against Stiff Competition in Hurdles, 440, Shot 
### WARREN BREED 
The might Trojana, ."{3 strong, arrive 011 the campus tomorrow morning
for the annual Card-Troy track meet. Troy is favored lo win, is given
anywhere from fid to Ka points over Coach Dir.k Templeton's thin line of
defenders.
Javelin throwing starts at 2:13 o'clock, the mile 15 minutes later. To- j
morrow may see the third upset in Trojan-Card annals. Two years ago
Troy was heavily favored, and Stanford won. Last year Stanford was 1

â™¦ favored, and TYoy won. So the stage
is all set for plenty of keen compe
tition and record performances.
Troy Co-Captain Out
! An Associated Press flash last
night indicated that the Trojans will
be captainless tomorrow. Co-cap
tain Norman Paul, joint holder of the?
world low hurdle record at 23 flat,
will stay at his home in Santa Ana,
the victim of an acute attack of ap
| penclicitis.
| Harry Tompkins, 440 man and the
. other captain, has been out all sea
, son with a leg fracture.
j Student tickets will go on sale to
i day at the B.A.C. for 40 cents. Gen
( eral admission will be $1.10.
KJopstock l aces Five
For the fourth time* in as many
i mpets it will be the job of Sammy
Klopstock to take both hurdle races.
S.C. brings up a team of five big
men to try and head him ofT.
Sammy beat the Trojans in the
| lows last year, running 2',5.2 to do it.
; His last two starts in Ihe lows this
i spring have not been winning ones,
; but. he may win tomorrow.
Hie 4HO will also be a classic, \
with Captain Al Blackmail up !
against Johnny McCarthy from j
the South. McCarthy was called j
the third best quartcr-milcr in the !
country hack in 1932, and his speed i
: has decreased no whit since. Card I
fans are picking Blackmail on the I
basis of hjs coasting 47.!) race last I
i week.
Another much-anticipated duel j
will be the discus, where gigantic I
Ken Carpenter meets Stanford's Phii j
Levy. Both have been ballyhooed j
for the past weeks as potential rec
ord-breakers. Both are apt to beat
160 feet on their first throws, which
is what the fans like.
A Stanford upset will depend '
greatly on the outcome of these j
three feature events. Other upsets |
arc possible in the 880, mile, broad j
jump, high jump, and shot.
Some Pick Schween
The condition of Humbert Smith, I
i the star high jumper, is apparently J
no better, and some are picking i
I Lloyd Schween to win the event. I
| Schween has been a decided thorn j
in the Trojan side for the past two |
| years, clearing 8:4 and 6:3 against '
them ,and may repeat.
In the distances Warren Dixon, '
Chuck Nimmo, and Rusty March j
are all possible upsets. Ray Dean
may get another good lc:\p of over
24 feet to break into the select S.C. j
trio of OSsen, Crawford, and Jung
keit. Al Hershey is being counted (
on to come through in the shot and !
discus, and a Card clean sweep in j
the javelin looms.
All-around Troy strength, how- |
ever, goes to back the concensus of I
opinion that all of these upsets must |
be realized to result in Card victory. !
