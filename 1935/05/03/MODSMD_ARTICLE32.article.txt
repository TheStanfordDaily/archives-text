# College Freedom of the Press
## 
### 
How much freedom of the college press is
there? Not enough, says Dr. Luther Harr,
who taught finance aUthe I'niversity of Penn
sylvania for ten years.
Speaking last week at a convention of the
i Intercollegiate Newspapers of the Middle At
lantic States, Dr. Harr was heard to remark
that the college press of the country operates
under "definite censorship" from faculty su
pervision and expressed a belief that it should
"he as free as its professional contempora
ries."
The good Doctor may have been speaking
with the utmost sincerity. How true his re
marks are is questionable. To say that the
college papers are under definite censorship
is not true. There are many colleges where
the only restraint upon freedom is where Ihe
hounds of common sense and decency are
exceeded.
Dr. Harr fails in one other line of reason
ing where he believes that the college press
should be as free as ils professional contem
porary. Unless he is of an extremely Utopian
viewpoint, the good Doctor would again real
ize that the freedom of the professional press
is an extremely debatable question.
Dr. Harr might be shocked and a little bit
disillusioned were he to realize thai only too
often the freedom of American newspapers is
tempered by political considerations, and that
a single owner of one huge chain of newspa
pers may allow freedom of the press only
where it coincides with his own personal
convictions.
