# May the Underdog Pull a Surprise!
## 
### 
Stanford trackmen, a much-raincd-ont ag
gregation of athletes, enter tomorrow's meet
with t'.S.C. the underdoes, with perhaps the
smallest chance in years of sending HI Tro
jan hack south on the short end of the score.
Hut Stanford teams are traditionally at
their hest on the short end of the odds, and
tomorrow's festivities may bring out any
number of performances which will surprise
Dean Cromwell's invaders.
Stanford has been unfortunate this year;
one meet alter another was rained out until
bv now the team has had a minimum of
competitive workouts. The contest will bear
watching, however, when the Farm's national
champions defend their honors against the
team which this year will prove one of the
biggest threats to those titles.
