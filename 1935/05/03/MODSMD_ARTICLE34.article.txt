# A 						New Deal Experiment
## 
### 
When the I'nited States of America bought
Alaska, skeptics razzed Secretary of Slate
Seward for throwing away money on the
notiorious "Seward's Ice Ho\." That was in
I <S()7.
Today a group ot 10(1(1 destitute tanners
from Minnesota, Michigan, and Wisconsin
are on their way to Alaska where hope and
opportunity awaits in Matanuska Valley.
These American farmers and their families
are being set up in this unoccupied valley by
the New Deal Administration which is staking
them to 1(1 acres of land, *3000 worth of
equipment and provisions, and sending a stall
of experts to organize and develop the project.
The government is furnishing the capital
and grub-stakes despite the fact that' other
government-backed pioneering projects have
met with only mediocre success.
If the ambitions and e'Torts of these de
scendants of former American pioneers prove
strong enough to overcome the lethargy and
supplant the alibis which have held back
other such projects, America will realize a
great asset from "Seward's I'olly." Alaska
will furnish a new frontier for development
of adventurous and ambitious Americans.
