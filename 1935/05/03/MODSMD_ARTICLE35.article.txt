# Save Stanford from Mosquitos
## 
### 
Willi llu* heavy rains over and the sunny,
warm weal lie r consoling; Ilio campus, Lake

Lagunita begins its annual receding routine.
Ihe drying-up process brings attending
thoughts of gnats and mosquitoes which have
already begun their foraging parties heckling
the campus populace.
Every year these insects infest the Farm
at this time and make life lor the Hough
rather unbearable. The placing of some mos
quito (isli or the carrying out of some other
abatement scheme is an effective weapon
which might be used under such circum
stances.
II the Administration would take as effec
tive and quick*action on the bug situation at
the lake as it did in relation to the tempera
ture problem in the I'niversity library, a
mosquito and gnal-hitlen campus would give
thanks.
