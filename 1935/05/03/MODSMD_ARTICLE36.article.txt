## THE 						NEXT WAR: GUERARD 
### CEDRIC LARSON 
Europe in 1935, as in 1912, is in the grip of l'ear,
and the present fear is inspired by a rejuvenated Ger
many. While the National Socialist leaders of the
Wilhelmstrasse dream of a great Pan-German empire
overshadowing Europe, and Teuton statesman think
again in terms of "Weltpolitik," the Reich re-echoes
with the sound of tramping feet and the clang-clang of
military activity.
Even England admits today that, the ability to use
force is of more importance than all the post-war
treaties, and as if to underscore the British statement,
Reichsfuehrer Adolf Hitler announces Germany's in
tent to rearm on land and sea as deemed fit irrespec
tive of the delimitations of the Treaty of Versailles.
Professor Albert L. Guerard points out that the
history of the Treaty of Versailles has been one
of constant amendment invariably to the advan
tage of Germany. The Allies, for instance dis
cussed reparations repeatedly, until, tiring of
years of haggling, they wiped indemnities prac
tic°Jly out.
Furthermore, Germany's equality was recog
nized by admission to the League as one of the
great powers with a permanent seat on the coun
cil. Likewise, the principle of equality in arma
ments has been observed by European disarma
ment conferences.
European disarmament, Professor Guerard stresses,
is contingent upon the security system, the principal
of mutual assistance, articles 10 and 16, the "heart of
the Covenant." But the American refusal to under
write the pact, paralyzing England, postpones the pos
sibility of real disarmament.
Although Germany has signed the Kellogg Pact,
renunciation to aggression and war as instruments of
national policy, Hitler avowedly intends to recover
lost territories, a policy encouraged by American
pacifists and liberals in sympathy with the German
"revanehards." This can never be done without war.
"The issue which so nv.ny nations are trying
to avoid tod-\y is 'revanche'," stales Professor Gue
rard. "French pacifists before 1914 fought their
own Revanehards and defeated them in 189!).
Russia and Turkey stand for peace, because they
have renounced 'Revanche.' So it must be for
Germany. If Germany will give up thought of
reconquest there will be no iron ring against her,
and she will be treated not only as an equal but
as a friend. There is no reason to believe that the
status quo afler the next war, if Germany won it,
would be more satisfactory than the present one,
and no territorial status quo is as bad as war."
France and Germany are in many ways in opposite
position in 1935 to what they were in 1912. France has
a gold supply comparable to that of the United States,
a self-sufficient colonial empire, and adequate defenses.
Germany's wealth and industrial leadership of pre
war days are gone, but she has 65,000,000 people welded
into a totalitarian state. The geographical propinquity
of Germany and France is unchanged, so the question
is, what will happen when the irresistible force meets
the immovable body?
Millions of Hitler Youth from 7 to 17 are being
trained in the military tradition, and the barracks,
drill ground and uniform become once more—as in
the Bismarckian "blood and iron" era and the days of
Treitschke's preachment of the philosophy of force—
accepted symbols of German life.
"The voice of the Fuehrer is the voice of Ger
many," cry the Nazis .and "Mein Kampf" has gone
through millions of editions. In the not too distant
future, the Reich will boast a military strength
rivalling in effectiveness the war-machine of the
Hohenzoilern epoch.
When the hour of the Revanehards inevitably
strikes, it will not be prostrate and powerless Germany
with which Europe will have to reckon, and at that
time the Treaty of Versailles may as well have been
written in water.
