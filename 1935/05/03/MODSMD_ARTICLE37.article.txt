## DO PROFESSORS WORK? 
### 
Consider this man:
He goes to college for six or eight years, works
fairly hard for his Phi Bete key, and writes a few
1 lengthy dissertations and a thesis. Then, well edu
cated in a certain field, he starts to teach. The first
' couple of years he has to spend some time getting his
j lecture notes ready for the rest of his life, and, if
ambitious, writing a textbook which he will require
; his students to buy. But after that—sitting in the
i classroom lor an average of two and a half hours a
i day, five days a week.
Does this man work? He is the average American
i college professor.
The typical college prof is chronically, typically and
incurably lazy. Perhaps his efforts in preparing him
self for his profession fatigued him for life. At any
rate he prefers talking to action or writing, and if he
had to spend much more than 12 hours a week teach
ing he would revolt. Yet he almost always considers
himself underpaid. With an average salary of $1000, he
j is paid as much, if not more, than he is worth.
But do the worthy professors admit all this? Of
course not. The time they spend in the class-room,
I according to them, is only a small part of their woik.
! They have lectures and lessons to prepare, an endless
I flow of papers and exams to correct, conferences, fac
; ully meetings, and other red tape to attend to. And
there is always research. Ah, research! Whether it's
Siwash or Harvard there's always research.
The average—the typical professor spends less time
doing research than he does at picture shows.
Lectures to prepare? One preparation serves year
after year. Exams to correct? There are always read
ers and there is always the wastebasket where more
student papers find their way than anybody knows,
except the janitor. Meetings are just things to go to
and quibble.
Professors are genial bluffers who seldom bring to
their woik anything akin to the exacting accuracy of an
I engineer, the energy and astuteness of a politician, the
geniality of a salesman, or the creative imagination of
j even a good columnist.
They are, on the whole,* honest, civil, quiet in
j dividual content in a sedentary and rather pleasant
j routine with relative financial security. Their jobs
I are snaps.
