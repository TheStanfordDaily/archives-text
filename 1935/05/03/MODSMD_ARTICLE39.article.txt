# BULL SESSION
## THE
						DONKEY'S EARS ARE BURNING 
### 
On Sunday last, the President of
the United States delivered another
of his homesy-folksy, chitty-chatty
radio addresses. It came forth on
the ether in the same mellifluous
Rooseveltian tones that have "got"
the American people. There was the
same warmth, the same personal
touches that have characterized the
President's other fireside talks. But
yet the speech was not like the
others.
There was a note of weariness in
the President's voice. And in con
trast with the strong self-assurance
of the previous speeches, there was
a touch of back-to-the-wall defi
ance in Mr. Roosevelt's demeanor.
It was plain that the President felt
himself at long last—on the de
fensive.
There was a pleasant little excuse
for the yachting trips aboard the
blue-nosed Nourmahal. There was a
short quick rabbit-punch for oppo
sition press and radio. There was a
tidy sop for the Townsendites and
other old-age pensioners. There was
an easing-up on the more blatant
aspects of the utility holding com
pany attack. There was direct an
swer to the charges of "graft" and
"scandal" in emergency relief op
erations. At times it appeared that
the President was not explaining his
jpJjpgram to the people, but was
rather attempting to explain awa?
the widespread onslaught on the
New Deal.
For a President of the United
States, the speech was a good one.
But unless adequate measures are
not soon taken to materially alle
viate of distress, the Suni
day talk and many of the others will
soon take on the cloak of polished
but unmistakeable demagoguery.
On at least one front, Roosevelt
has made himself completely vul
nerable to attack—both from right
and from left: The country was al
most accustomed to the paradox of
"poverty in the midst of plenty." But
the nation has not yet swallowed the
added paradox of "poverty created
by the destruction of plenty." It will
be difficult to erase from the minds
ol ihe people and from the annals
of history the record of the Demo
cratic party—which has made the
contented cow discontented, so that
people would not have enough milk
to drink.
Granted that Franklin Delano
Roosevelt has a hard row to hoe, he
will inevitably be judged by the re
sults that he achieves. And unless
he is able to shower down happiness
upon the American people (along
with a shower of "best American
diction"), Roosevelt will not be able
to keep this country from the hungry
maws of a Huey Long.
