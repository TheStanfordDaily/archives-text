CHANGE OF CURRICULUM
FOR WOMEN
The Editor, Sir:
Stanford, essentially a man's uni
versity, opened its portals, finan
cially, in 19315 to women. But, while
accepting their quarterly SI 15, it
made no change in the scholastic
curriculum to develop feminine in
tellectual capabilities. To be pre
cise, what does the average Stanford
co-ed absorb from her course which
would prepare her for life? She
learns a little physical science, so
cial science, English, and a few other
subjects not particularly useful nor
applicable to her future social posi
tion. If and when she graduates, she
will have mastered political science,
sociology, economics (or even, en
gineering!); but what possible use
can any woman (except those desir
ing careers, of course) have for these
subjects in the drawing room, or
nursery, or kitchen?
What does a man look for —even
expect—in a woman? Certainly not
a knowledge of political science, eco
nomics, etc., but rather refinement
in the social graces. Do Stanford
women have an opportunity to culti
vate these social graces? Decidedly
no! Such things as poise and dig- ;
nity, conversational ability, modish '
dress, ability to entertain grace- )
fully, artistic appreciation, and even
ordinary etiquette are essential for
women's true place in life —in short, |
we want truly feminine women.
Therefore, may we propose that, as 1
long as women must attend this uni
versity, the curriculum be changed to I
provide women with an opportunity !
to learn a few of these necessary
feminine attributes. After all. this is
the only possible benefit that a
woman can derive from her educa- |
tion. We repeat: less scholasticism, '
and more cultural refinement.
Sincerely,

this time to thank Willard Eisner
and his efficient group of Conval
escent Home Drive committeemen
lor the remarkable way in which the
drive was handled this year. Also
the student body as a whole re
sponded beautifully to the appeal
lor charity. The committee, besides
setting a marvelous contribution
record, one of the largest in Stan
ford Convalescent Home Drive his
tory, administered successfully. It
is evident that there is a better taste
in the mouth of the campus than
there ever has been. No one feels
that he was unduly pressed to make
contributions. There are a few stu
dents who feel that there were too
many activities, but let us not forget
that ' besides doing a worthwhile
thing, the students obtain a lot of
entertainment (of course at their
own expense), and this is the one;
occasion that the entire student body
is enabled to participate in an en
terprise which is both socially and
morally desirable.
Sincerely,
