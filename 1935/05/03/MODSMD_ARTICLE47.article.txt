"GEORGE WHITES SCANDALS
OF 1935" and "PRINCESS OTIARA"
At the Fox Stanford
Alice Faye, very platinum and
perhaps too plump to be pleasing,
and James Dunn, probably the
screen's oldest juvenile, co-star in
the 1935 Scandals. Word of warn-

ing: this is a
musical.
They portray
two small town
celebrities who
are taken to
Broadway as '
stars and ac
quire sable

coats, night-club friends, and high
hats. A visit of their kindly old
;iunt saves the day % ; they win their
jobs again, are married, and pre- (
sumably live happily ever after.
Musical numbers are slightly j
above average at first; they grow J
worse and worse as the picture |
wends its weary way. We hate to
think what would have happened if I
it had lasted ten minutes longer.
"Princess O'Hara" concerns a
young girl who. in spite of dancing
at a night club and driving a han
some, can appear al a race track in i
the sort of sun bonnet you wore at !
the age of nine. —Whitmore.
