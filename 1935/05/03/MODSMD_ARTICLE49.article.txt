## Nellie Hag Favored To Win Kentucky Classic 
### Elliot Viney 
Tomorrow is Derby Day! One
hundred thousand people are ex
pected to be on hand to witness the
annual Churchill Downs-Kentucky
classic, for many the greatest sport
ing event of the year.
Which horse will break the tape?
It's not a race for the ladies in horse
dom, but this wandering reporter
expects to see Nellie Flag flirting
.she leads the way down the home
over her shoulder with the pack as
stretch. Her parentage is of the
fleetest—she is by American Flag
and Nellie Morse.
But the little filly will have to
turn in her best performance to win.
The Whitney colt, Today, was im
pressive in winning the Jamaica
stakes recently, and Box Thorn, the
Bradley entry, has fast workouts to
show him in prime condition.
Omaha, Plat Eye, another Whitney
entry, and Commonwealth, owned
by Mrs. Jeffries, will also be in there
trying, but have not the chance of
the other starters. Chance Sun, the
favorite in the winter book, was
scratched, as he has been emulating
the well-known turtle of late.
Recent rains in the blue grass
regions have the track fetlock deep
in mud. Nellie Flag, who has proven
herself to be probably the best mud
der in the field, should find the mire
to her liking.
Behind Nellie your scribe picks
Box Thorn to place, and Omaha to
show. Nellie's win by eight lengths
in the Cherokee Handicap makes
her too good to overlook. So there
we stand—bet 'em high and sleep
in the street.
