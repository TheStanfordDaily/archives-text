### CRANT LEIBERT 
April 26, 1935
Ilermosillo, Mexico. What official
title one would give Jose, I don't
knowl He is the small, slender
Mexican-negro boy who has as
sumed complete active control ol' the
hotel. True, there are the senor and
the senora, who lost their riches dur- j
ing the last revolution, but he arises i
only in time for his siesta, which j
extends until it is time to go to bed j
again, and the senora—nothing but '
bridge, bridge, bridge all day long j
and far into the night. So it is a j
good thing that there is an Jose who j
is always on the job. He met me at j
the taxi the night I arrived, di- j
rected me to his establishment, fixed j
the price of my room, carried my |
luggage upstairs and attended to the J
other details.
In the mornings he awakens me, j
and when I arrive downstairs, he is
wearing a white coat and serves me
breakfast. He sweeps, sprinkles the
flowers and patio, and later he takes :
a basket on his arm and goes off to !
market. Jose is always smiling, and |
life would be unmarred for him if he I
could remedy one continual torment \
—his kinky black hair. It is fuzzy, j
unruly stuff, unresponsive to his ut
most efforts to make it lie flat and !
sleek. He plasters it with pommado, j
and never fails to wear a very soiled j
skull-cap, made from the top of a 1
woman's stocking. But it is useless;

from all sides of his beanie peek wiry
little ringlets of black, black hair.
Matter has not been conquered by
mind in this instance.
Like most Mexican cities Iler
mosillo has a prison large enough
to hold almost its entire popula
tion. As 1 entered the piace there
was one lone gu-ird, in a com
bined position of at ease, rest,
and dismissed, stationed at the
doorway. Twenty yards away, in
the shade of some oaks, were half
a dozen more uniformed men, be
ing fed by their respective fami
lies or sleeping. I passed the guard
without the least sign of recogni
tion from him and entered the
warden's office. A very portly
gentlenvm nodded to me from he
hind a desk, and I expressed my
wish to have the honor of seeing
this famous prison and its in
mates.
The warden heaved a heart-rend
ing little sigh and, with a look of
silent importunity, asked me if it
would not do just as well to have a
few of the prisoners brought into
his ofl'ice instead of our troubling to
see them. But I protested, ungra
ciously, perhaps, that I had come a
long way for the purpose of seeing
the felons in their natural habitat
and would prefer to expend the ef
fort of visiting them, I won, at last,
and he took me through the prison.
May I say here that the Hermo
sillo penitentiary is the cleanest
thing 1 have seen in Mexico. It is
scrubbed thrice a day and kept spot
less. The warden told me that no
one ever tried to escape; and, indeed,
why should he? He is fed, bedded,
and clothcd for nothing in prison,
and in the outside world he might
work all day to attain that.
There was a large court where
the boys could play basketball, a
ring for boxing, and even a spa
cious swimming pool. As we were
about to le*\ve, the warden pointed
out a lunatic, who was going
through the motions of taking a
bath in the sunlight which poured
in the grilled window. The mad
man beckoned me to him and
asked for a match. The warden
sharply ordered him to desist, and
as he turned to go on, the luna
tic gave me a knowing w ink, at the
same time circling his ear with
his index finger and indacting the
official. I nodded in agreement
and. giving a series of hoarse
cackles, lie scrambled back to his
sun bathing.
Antoinette and her sister, Marie,
were very kind to my two American
friends and me. They took us swim
ming, to play tennis and, in the af
ternoons and evenings, for long
drives in their automobile around
the city and its environs. As long
as there were odd numbers of us
we might go practically anywhere
together; but couples were abso
lutely tabooed. The only time a
couple are permitted alone is when
they have an iron grill between
them.

Ilermosillo, Mexico. What official
title one would give Jose, I don't
knowl He is the small, slender
Mexican-negro boy who has as
sumed complete active control ol' the
hotel. True, there are the senor and
the senora, who lost their riches dur- j
ing the last revolution, but he arises i
only in time for his siesta, which j
extends until it is time to go to bed j
again, and the senora—nothing but '
bridge, bridge, bridge all day long j
and far into the night. So it is a j
good thing that there is an Jose who j
is always on the job. He met me at j
the taxi the night I arrived, di- j
rected me to his establishment, fixed j
the price of my room, carried my |
luggage upstairs and attended to the J
other details.
In the mornings he awakens me, j
and when I arrive downstairs, he is
wearing a white coat and serves me
breakfast. He sweeps, sprinkles the
flowers and patio, and later he takes :
a basket on his arm and goes off to !
market. Jose is always smiling, and |
life would be unmarred for him if he I
could remedy one continual torment \
—his kinky black hair. It is fuzzy, j
unruly stuff, unresponsive to his ut
most efforts to make it lie flat and !
sleek. He plasters it with pommado, j
and never fails to wear a very soiled j
skull-cap, made from the top of a 1
woman's stocking. But it is useless;

from all sides of his beanie peek wiry
little ringlets of black, black hair.
Matter has not been conquered by
mind in this instance.
Like most Mexican cities Iler
mosillo has a prison large enough
to hold almost its entire popula
tion. As 1 entered the piace there
was one lone gu-ird, in a com
bined position of at ease, rest,
and dismissed, stationed at the
doorway. Twenty yards away, in
the shade of some oaks, were half
a dozen more uniformed men, be
ing fed by their respective fami
lies or sleeping. I passed the guard
without the least sign of recogni
tion from him and entered the
warden's office. A very portly
gentlenvm nodded to me from he
hind a desk, and I expressed my
wish to have the honor of seeing
this famous prison and its in
mates.
The warden heaved a heart-rend
ing little sigh and, with a look of
silent importunity, asked me if it
would not do just as well to have a
few of the prisoners brought into
his ofl'ice instead of our troubling to
see them. But I protested, ungra
ciously, perhaps, that I had come a
long way for the purpose of seeing
the felons in their natural habitat
and would prefer to expend the ef
fort of visiting them, I won, at last,
and he took me through the prison.
May I say here that the Hermo
sillo penitentiary is the cleanest
thing 1 have seen in Mexico. It is
scrubbed thrice a day and kept spot
less. The warden told me that no
one ever tried to escape; and, indeed,
why should he? He is fed, bedded,
and clothcd for nothing in prison,
and in the outside world he might
work all day to attain that.
There was a large court where
the boys could play basketball, a
ring for boxing, and even a spa
cious swimming pool. As we were
about to le*\ve, the warden pointed
out a lunatic, who was going
through the motions of taking a
bath in the sunlight which poured
in the grilled window. The mad
man beckoned me to him and
asked for a match. The warden
sharply ordered him to desist, and
as he turned to go on, the luna
tic gave me a knowing w ink, at the
same time circling his ear with
his index finger and indacting the
official. I nodded in agreement
and. giving a series of hoarse
cackles, lie scrambled back to his
sun bathing.
Antoinette and her sister, Marie,
were very kind to my two American
friends and me. They took us swim
ming, to play tennis and, in the af
ternoons and evenings, for long
drives in their automobile around
the city and its environs. As long
as there were odd numbers of us
we might go practically anywhere
together; but couples were abso
lutely tabooed. The only time a
couple are permitted alone is when
they have an iron grill between
them.

April 26, 1935
Ilermosillo, Mexico. What official
title one would give Jose, I don't
knowl He is the small, slender
Mexican-negro boy who has as
sumed complete active control ol' the
hotel. True, there are the senor and
the senora, who lost their riches dur- j
ing the last revolution, but he arises i
only in time for his siesta, which j
extends until it is time to go to bed j
again, and the senora—nothing but '
bridge, bridge, bridge all day long j
and far into the night. So it is a j
good thing that there is an Jose who j
is always on the job. He met me at j
the taxi the night I arrived, di- j
rected me to his establishment, fixed j
the price of my room, carried my |
luggage upstairs and attended to the J
other details.
In the mornings he awakens me, j
and when I arrive downstairs, he is
wearing a white coat and serves me
breakfast. He sweeps, sprinkles the
flowers and patio, and later he takes :
a basket on his arm and goes off to !
market. Jose is always smiling, and |
life would be unmarred for him if he I
could remedy one continual torment \
—his kinky black hair. It is fuzzy, j
unruly stuff, unresponsive to his ut
most efforts to make it lie flat and !
sleek. He plasters it with pommado, j
and never fails to wear a very soiled j
skull-cap, made from the top of a 1
woman's stocking. But it is useless;

from all sides of his beanie peek wiry
little ringlets of black, black hair.
Matter has not been conquered by
mind in this instance.
Like most Mexican cities Iler
mosillo has a prison large enough
to hold almost its entire popula
tion. As 1 entered the piace there
was one lone gu-ird, in a com
bined position of at ease, rest,
and dismissed, stationed at the
doorway. Twenty yards away, in
the shade of some oaks, were half
a dozen more uniformed men, be
ing fed by their respective fami
lies or sleeping. I passed the guard
without the least sign of recogni
tion from him and entered the
warden's office. A very portly
gentlenvm nodded to me from he
hind a desk, and I expressed my
wish to have the honor of seeing
this famous prison and its in
mates.
The warden heaved a heart-rend
ing little sigh and, with a look of
silent importunity, asked me if it
would not do just as well to have a
few of the prisoners brought into
his ofl'ice instead of our troubling to
see them. But I protested, ungra
ciously, perhaps, that I had come a
long way for the purpose of seeing
the felons in their natural habitat
and would prefer to expend the ef
fort of visiting them, I won, at last,
and he took me through the prison.
May I say here that the Hermo
sillo penitentiary is the cleanest
thing 1 have seen in Mexico. It is
scrubbed thrice a day and kept spot
less. The warden told me that no
one ever tried to escape; and, indeed,
why should he? He is fed, bedded,
and clothcd for nothing in prison,
and in the outside world he might
work all day to attain that.
There was a large court where
the boys could play basketball, a
ring for boxing, and even a spa
cious swimming pool. As we were
about to le*\ve, the warden pointed
out a lunatic, who was going
through the motions of taking a
bath in the sunlight which poured
in the grilled window. The mad
man beckoned me to him and
asked for a match. The warden
sharply ordered him to desist, and
as he turned to go on, the luna
tic gave me a knowing w ink, at the
same time circling his ear with
his index finger and indacting the
official. I nodded in agreement
and. giving a series of hoarse
cackles, lie scrambled back to his
sun bathing.
Antoinette and her sister, Marie,
were very kind to my two American
friends and me. They took us swim
ming, to play tennis and, in the af
ternoons and evenings, for long
drives in their automobile around
the city and its environs. As long
as there were odd numbers of us
we might go practically anywhere
together; but couples were abso
lutely tabooed. The only time a
couple are permitted alone is when
they have an iron grill between
them.
