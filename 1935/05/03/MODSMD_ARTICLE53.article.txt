April 26, 1935
Ilermosillo, Mexico. What official
title one would give Jose, I don't
knowl He is the small, slender
Mexican-negro boy who has as
sumed complete active control ol' the
hotel. True, there are the senor and
the senora, who lost their riches dur- j
ing the last revolution, but he arises i
only in time for his siesta, which j
extends until it is time to go to bed j

and never fails to wear a very soiled j
skull-cap, made from the top of a 1
woman's stocking. But it is useless;

from all sides of his beanie peek wiry
little ringlets of black, black hair.
Matter has not been conquered by
mind in this instance.
Like most Mexican cities Iler
mosillo has a prison large enough
to hold almost its entire popula
tion. As 1 entered the piace there
was one lone gu-ird, in a com
bined position of at ease, rest,
and dismissed, stationed at the
doorway. Twenty yards away, in
the shade of some oaks, were half
a dozen more uniformed men, be
ing fed by their respective fami
lies or sleeping. I passed the guard
without the least sign of recogni
