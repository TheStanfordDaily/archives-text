Strengthened .since last week's
Arizona series, Stanford's poloists
will resume activity when they en
gage the University of Southern
California four this afternoon on the
highway field beginning at 3 o'clock.
On the basis of comparative scores
and past performances the redshirts
should come out on top though a
close, exciting contest will undoubt
edly result.
Lieut. H. Y. Grubbs' riders, smart
ing under their recent triple defeat
at the hands of Arizona's invincible
quartet, will be out today to advance
their campaign of establishing Coast
.supremacy among collegiate mallet
men. Arizona found the Indian out
fit hopelessly weakened by last min
ute losses of two first string players
but today the situation is much im
proved as the full Stanford line-up,
with the exception of Ru.ss Rasmus
sen, is in top condition to give the
Trojans a real battle.
Beal for Kasmussen
Rasmussen's injured knee will
keep him among the spectators this
afternoon though the remainder of
the Stanford line-up will be as
Usual. Carl Beal will continue in
Rasmussen's No. 3 position, while
Bill Enemark will hold down Beal's
regular spot at No. 1.
Captain Bill Rogers will be at his
usual No, 2 job while Bob Fullerton,
now fully recovered from recent ill
ness, will complete the redshirt line
up at No. 4. In case S.C.'s riders
weaken, Lieut. Grubbs 1 excellent
substitutes may see service. These
second string men include Jim Hen
derson, who took Fullerton's place
in the first two Arizona encounters,
Ed McKeon and John Dwyer.
Trojans Powerful
From all reports the Trojans have
powerful outfit. They have won
all the leading college poloists
» state, having taken easy vie
over California and U.C.L.A.
