# Stanford Netmen Elect Law, Lynch Co-Captains
## 
### 
Johnny Law and Jack Lynch-were i
| elected co-captains of the 1936 var
sity tennis team at a dinner held last
| night by Coach Sherman Lockwood
| and members of the squad. This is |
j the first time that two men have j
j shared leadership of the Cardinal i
j net aggregation.
Law piloted the 1933 frosh netmen 1
i through a successful season, and has |
been one of the Coast's leading col- 1
legiate players for the past two
years. Late in the 1935 conference
season he replaced Captain Sam Lee
as first single player.
Seward Defeated
j The stocky junior justified that po
! sition by leading his team to victory !
I over California and a perfect con-
I ference record, and then defeating
j his sophomore team-mate, Bill !
j Seward, in the finals of the Ojai Val-fJ
| ley tournament.
j Lynch is completing his first sea
i son as an Indian racket-wielder; so '

| his election is a special honor. The
little co-captain-elect, a transfer
from Taft Junior College, has a fine
1935 record, marked by a sparkling
i triumph over Gene Mako, who ranks I
high nationally.
Enter Eastern Meet
It is now almost certain that Stan- i
' ford will be represented at the Na- |
tional Intercollegiates, set for North- J
western University at Evanston,
Illinois. This event will last nearly j
j a week, from Tuesday, June 25, un- j
til June 30 or July 1. The entire j
i six-man team, composed of Law,
Lynch, Seward, Ben Dey, and Bob
Pommer, will probably make the
trip.
Postings for matches in the annual â€¢
interclass tennis tournament are now I
lon the Encina gym bulletin board, j
; Senior Tennis Manager Johnny Den- !
dahl requests that all first-round |
! matches not already completed be j
' played today or tomorrow.
