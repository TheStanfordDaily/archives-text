# FINE MARKS DEFY FARM ATHLETES IN DECATHLON MEET
## Phi Psi Team Defends Title In Event May 13 
### 
Entries in Stanford's second an-
nual all-University decathlon are
promised several exceptional records
to aim at during the three-day pro-
gram beginning May 13.
The marks are excellent, con-
sidering the fact that the event
was especially designed to be
equally difficult to trained and un-
trained athletes alike. Parmer
Fuller's 5.6 second mark in the 50-
yard dash, Giff Meyers' average
of 53.8 yards in the football punt,
and Dolin Lindsay's baseball toss
of over 331 feet indicate the type
of records that decathlon champ
aspirants will attempt to best.
Jim Trompas is defending his in-
dividual championship title this year,
while Phi Kappa Psi will attempt to
ward off all threats to annex their
athletic, faculty, and Daily trophies,
won each year by the team scoring
the most points.
