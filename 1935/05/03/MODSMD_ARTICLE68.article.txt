## HERSHEY FILLS WILLSON'S ROLE 
### 
The world loves a winner all right,
but sport fans get a bigger kick out
of the hard-luck kids that finally
make good.
Along with all the champions
that went witli two national track
titles last year, it was Jimmy
Willson, distinctly not a champion,
who gave the greatest thrill. It
was Willson, in a game comeback
."iter three seasons of pulled mus
cles, who had the self-confidence
to enter himself against the coun
try's foremost sprinters in the
N.C.A.A. meet and then take the
points that finally gave Stanford
the victory.
This year A1 Hershey seems head
ed for a similar role; his points in
weight events may be the big ones
in coming meets.
Up to a few weeks ago A1 earned
only sighs of regret from the Farm
followers of athletics. Two years
ago Coach John Bunn needed a cen
ter for his Indian quintet, and Her
shey was given a chance to fill the
bill. For a while the weak spot
seemed well taken care of. Then a
dislocated shoulder ended the bas
ket bali season for Hershey.
A1 was in the University boxing
championships as a heavyweight a
year ago. His chances for the title
were Rood, until the same dislocated
shoulder ended his fling at boxing
for the year. College athletics were
a series of disappointments for A1
Hershey.
That was up till threw weeks
ago. Then A1 happened around
Angell Field a (lay or two before
the track team left for (he U.C.L.A.
meet in Los Angeles. Dink was
hunting for broadjumpers, and
Hershey, with other passers-by,
found himself on the runway. It
w*\s a leap of 21 feet fi inches that
put Hershey on the squad, and he
went south with, the team two

days later.
He never did turn out to be a
broadjumper, but from the begin
ning he started making points in the
shot and discuss. He took two thirds
against U.C.L.A. In the Big Meet he
was one of the few Stanford sur
prises, and upset all the dope sheets
when he took a third behind Levy
and Randell in the discus.
Now he's in a "foot-a week" role.
His rapid improvement makes him a
likely point-earner against the Tro
jans tomorrow. He may be a sev
enth to Stanford's six likely entries
in the 1.C.4-A. The luck comes in
bunches for A1 Hershey.
