# I.C.4-A. TENSION TOMORROW TOO
## 
### 
Tomorrow Stanford will learn not
only whether or not she can beat
the Trojans in a dual meet, but also
will get a good indication of how
many points to expect in the 1.C.4-A.
The Indians and the Trojans will
cut each other's throats a good deal
at Cambridge three weeks from now,
and who wins in certain events to
morrow will mean a lot to the dope
sters.
Both schools are counting heav
ily on points in the hurdles. If
Sam Klopstock is a double win
ner over S.C.'s half-dozen ace
timber-toppers. Stanford's I. C.
4-A., hopes will go up. Whether
Phil Levy or Ken Carpenter gets
the five points at Cambridge in
the discus throw can be doped
from tomorrow's results. Humh
Smith's ->nkle is hardly in the best
shape, but the high jump is an
other event which will be watched
with interest tomorrow, from the
1.C.4-A. viewpoint.
