# Ex Committee Passes On Winter Athletic Awards
## 
### 
Winter quarter sport men have
been blossoming out with sweaters,
circles, blocks, and numerals as a
result of the awards granted by Ex
Committee Tuesday night.
Varsity tennis players received
gold emblems because they de
feated California. Varsity baseball
men received sweaters, varsity
fencers received circle letters,
freshman track and b'vseball stars
got numerals, while a freshman
fencer got a circle numeral.
At the same time, Ex Committee
changed the requirement for ba.se
ball awards to make the minimum
either four and a half innings
against California, nine innings
against S.C., or one-half of the rest
of the games. This was changed from
the requirement of one-i>ixth of the
Big Series because it dealt hardships
to pitchers in extra-inning games.
