# Program Sale Closes Today
## 
### 
Tomorrow afternoon at 5 o'clock
has been positively set as the time
limit within which seniors may or
der programs and announcements at
the A.S.S.U. office. Since the com
plete orders must go to the printing
company immediately, the time can
not be extended.
All members of the graduating
class are expected to order pro
grams. Bound in wine-red leather
and containing lists of the members
and activities of the class, they sell
for $1 apiece. Announcements arc
10 cents each.
Distribution of the completed or
ders will be made early in June from
the Alumni Office. Seniors must pay
for the orders at the time they are
placed.
