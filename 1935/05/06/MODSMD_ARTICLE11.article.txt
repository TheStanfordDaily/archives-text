### 
LONDON, May 5 (/P).—A surging
crowd of 50,000 persons broke pell
mell through police lines today,
I sweeping the mounties buck before a
| great tidal wave of humanity, in a
| wild rush to witness the colorful
spectacle of the changing of the
guards at Buckingham Palace.
Following the lead of the first sec
tion of the throng to break, virtually
the whole crowd joined the stampede
and stormed across the road.
Cries of terror from women and
children being crushed against the
palace railings were shortlived, as
t he efficient bobbies waded in
I smilingly lutl firmly and "shep
! herded" the straying flock back in
ordered lines.
King George's concern for the
I crowds, come to celebrate his silver
I jubilee, was illustrated when, in-
I formed of the enormous throngs in
I the streets, he ordered immediately
| that Hyde Park remain open for the
| night.
j Thousands bearing blankets and
hampers of food were given permis
! sion to camp for the night in the
I park, as well as on the benches along
! the Thames river embankment.
Both King George and Queen
Mary remained secluded in the
I solace' throughout the day, to the
disappointment of the throngs
which kept a hawk-like watch
from early morning to long past
nightfall.
The merest flutter of a curtain at
j a palace window was enough to
I bring the crowd surging forward,
i hoping for a glimpse of the sover
| cigns.
Meantime a deep feeling of the
[ significance of the jubilee dominated
! London on the eve of the silver ju
! bilee thanksgiving.
Thirty thousand communist
members of Great Britain's "unit
ed front" marched on Ilvde Park
I today, protesting tomorrow's cele
bration of King George's silver
jubilee.
"The jubilee celebration is war
! preparation," tliey chanted.
Red contingents from all parts of
London threw fresh chaos into al
most paralyzed traffic conditions.
Seven hundred "bobbies," mount
| ed and on foot, good naturedly mar
j .shaled the demonstrations to the
; park, where they flaunted banners
j inscribed with such slogans as: "We
want bread, not jubilees." Fifty
thousand pounds for King George
and 17 shillings for George King."
The communists heckled Socialist
speakers in the park, including Her
bert Morrison, so-called "Prime
iMnister of London," who arrived in
i i' coal truck, wearing a top hat.

Thirty thousand communist
members of Great Britain's "unit
ed front" marched on Ilvde Park
I today, protesting tomorrow's cele
bration of King George's silver
jubilee.
"The jubilee celebration is war
! preparation," tliey chanted.
Red contingents from all parts of
London threw fresh chaos into al
most paralyzed traffic conditions.
Seven hundred "bobbies," mount
| ed and on foot, good naturedly mar
j .shaled the demonstrations to the
; park, where they flaunted banners
j inscribed with such slogans as: "We
want bread, not jubilees." Fifty
thousand pounds for King George
and 17 shillings for George King."
The communists heckled Socialist
speakers in the park, including Her
bert Morrison, so-called "Prime
iMnister of London," who arrived in
i i' coal truck, wearing a top hat.
LONDON, May 5 (/P).—A surging
crowd of 50,000 persons broke pell
mell through police lines today,
I sweeping the mounties buck before a
| great tidal wave of humanity, in a
| wild rush to witness the colorful
spectacle of the changing of the
guards at Buckingham Palace.
Following the lead of the first sec
tion of the throng to break, virtually
the whole crowd joined the stampede
and stormed across the road.
Cries of terror from women and
children being crushed against the
palace railings were shortlived, as
t he efficient bobbies waded in
I smilingly lutl firmly and "shep
! herded" the straying flock back in
ordered lines.
King George's concern for the
I crowds, come to celebrate his silver
I jubilee, was illustrated when, in-
I formed of the enormous throngs in
I the streets, he ordered immediately
| that Hyde Park remain open for the
| night.
j Thousands bearing blankets and
hampers of food were given permis
! sion to camp for the night in the
I park, as well as on the benches along
! the Thames river embankment.
Both King George and Queen
Mary remained secluded in the
I solace' throughout the day, to the
disappointment of the throngs
which kept a hawk-like watch
from early morning to long past
nightfall.
The merest flutter of a curtain at
j a palace window was enough to
I bring the crowd surging forward,
i hoping for a glimpse of the sover
| cigns.
Meantime a deep feeling of the
[ significance of the jubilee dominated
! London on the eve of the silver ju
! bilee thanksgiving.
