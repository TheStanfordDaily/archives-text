# Letter Found in Library Discloses Author's Fraud

### BOB EISENBACH 
"Revolt in the Desert," bizarre
j tale of a white man's conquest of
savage lands, which created a sen
sation whc*n it was first published, is
branded by its author, T. E. La\v
rencc, as a "dishonest thing, delib
erately produced by myself to sell
!<O,OOO copies, and pay off my over
draft," in one of a number of hith
erto unknown letters discovered in
the files of the Hoover War Library.
The book, which tells of Law
rence's conquest of Palestine, Arabia,
j and the Near East for the allies dur
ing the World War, was, according
Ito its writer's word, published to
I liquidate debts incurred by publica
tion of a prior work, "Seven Pillars
|of Wisdom," recognized by British
! critics as "a masterpiece.
Another tangle in the life of the
enigmatic Englishman, whose name
i typifies romance and adventure, is
I revealed in a letter to ' P." in which
(Lawrcnce reveals his true name as
T. E. Shav Lawrence, his name
during th< , was not formally
renourcd 1922.
The letti question was written
lafter ihe following publication
'of the Se Pillars " The complete
| text follov

! ' Dear P.
"You must have this rotten little
book, I suppose, as we worked to
gether for two of the years during
which the big book was on ihe
.stocks: but I grudge it to you. There's
no autograph in it. Every copy of
the Seven Pillars was signed, and no
copy of 'Revolt' ever will be signed:
i because it is a dishonest thing, de
liberately produced by myself to
sell 30,000 copies, and pay off my
overdraft.
"At present, on the edge of pub
lication, I'm afraid that perhaps I've
! made a bad estimation of the public
appetite: and instead of selling 30,000
i copies, I'll sell only .'3OOO, and be still
left in the mud. In cooler moments
I'm sure lhat there is plenty of re
serve in hand, and tlrSt I'll have to
put inlo operation a guillotine clause
of my contract with Capo, which en
ables me to call off the sale when
ever I please. Let's hope so: a big
sale quickly over: and then a peace
ful return home, about 1031. 1 wish
it was 1931, now.
Yours ever.
"T. E. Shaw.
" 'Revolt' is published as by T. E
Lawrence, my name during the war,
which I did not formally renounce
, till 1922. Sorry!"
