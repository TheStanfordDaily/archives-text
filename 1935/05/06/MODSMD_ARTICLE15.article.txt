# FAVILLE TO TALK ON KGO TONIGHT
## Business Professor Speaks On Distribution 
### 
Twelve per cent of the merchan
dise bought in department stores —
$40,000,000 annually—Ls returned by
customers. This return privilege is
only one of the reasons why goods
are sold to consumers at high prices,
but with little profit to distributors.
Professor David E. Faville, of the
Graduate School of Business, pointed
out in advance of a radio talk, "Be
hind the Scenes with the Distribu
tor," to be broadcast on the Stanford
Radio Hour over station KGO (his
evening at 8 o'clock.
"The distributor of merchandise is
caught in a machineery that grinds
out for him an unhappy economic
existence," said Professor Faville.
"On the one hand ,the distributor is
faced with the demands of consum
ers for all sorts of services which
are expensive to the distributor. On
(he other hand, the high-pressure
sales methods of manufacturers in
crease the distributor's costs of doing
business and, in consequence, the
sale price of merchandise."
Professor Faville, formerly dean
of the School of Business Adminis
tration and director of business re
search at the University of Oregon,
is in charge of the courses in mar
keting, sales management, and re
tail store management at Stanford.
