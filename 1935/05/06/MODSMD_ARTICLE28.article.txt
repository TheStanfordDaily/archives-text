Falling before an all-powerful
Trojan track team, the Stanford
! varsity suffered its worst defeat of
■ the year last Saturday afternoon on
[♦heir own field by a score of 88-43.
i Garnering five firsts, and setting two
meet records to Troy's three, the
Cardinals, led by ace hurdler Sam
Klopstock, were outclassed in ten
events of the afternoon's activities
just as the critics had predicted.
Since records have fallen so
thick and fast during the past two
years in the Stanford Stadium, it
was not unusual to see five of them
shattered when two tc\ms such as
Stanford and U.S.C. were pitted
! against each other.
Among the Trojan record break
! ers was .sophomore pole vaulter
Earle Meadows, who cleared 14 feet
i 3% inchcs to raise the meet record.
, Meadows nearly made his second try
| for the world record and showed that
| he will be an active contender for
! the much sought after mark.
I "Big" Ben Eastman's meet record
! in the half was lowered by Ross
j Bush by three-fifths of a second.
I A powerful Trojan mile relay team
! managed to clip almost a full second
j from the record formerly held by
Stanford runners, Shove, A. Hables,
L. Hables, and B. Eastman. The In
dians, handicapped by the loss of Al
■ Blackman in the relay, were pretty
i well outclassed in this event.
Klopstock Stars
The mighty little Sam Klopstock
took all honors for the day's work,
i Besides keeping the Stanford colors
| out in the front in both hurdle races,
| he managed to hang up a new record
j of 14.4 in the 120-yard highs.
The fact that he got a late start in
■ this race didn't bother Sam, he just
: poured it on in the last stretch to
| cheat, three highly touted S.C. men
in this event. Repeating his success
' in the 220-yard low hurdles, by run
| ning a beautiful and well timed race,
' he gathered ten points for himself in
| the meet.
Mottram's Best Throw-
Led by Johnny Mottram, who set
the second meet record for the Stan
ford team, the Cards made a clean
sweep in the javelin throw. Follow
ing him in second and third places,
' respectively, were Sales and Beatty.
Jin; Reynolds managed to get off
his best heave of the year and sent
j the iron pellet 51 feet 3 inches to win
! the shot event from Carpenter of
S.C. Phil Levy added another point
to Stanford's score by getting a third
! in the same event.
The rare of the century found
Dean of Stanford tieing Draper for
j a well won second, with Boone of
I Southern California barely nosing
out the Trojan and Cardinal men.
A clean sweep in the pole vault
: and broad jump boosted the Tro-
I ian score considerably. Chuck
! Nimmo ran his best race hut was
up against too much competition.
His second in the half was well
J won.
The most disappointing race of the
meet was between McCarthy and
l Captain Al Blackman of the Stan
j ford team. Both have turned the
quarter well under 48 fiat. Black
man followed McCarthy during the
I whole race and seemed 1o tie up in
1 the sprint when he was passed by
Cassin. His third in the 440 and his
failure to place later in the 220
proved that it was an off day for
the Cards' flashy quarter miler.
I However, Al still has his chance to
