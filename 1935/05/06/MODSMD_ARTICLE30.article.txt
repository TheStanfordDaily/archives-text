# Stanford Track Team Licked? Not Yet
## 
### 
There was a Trojan track team on the
Stanford campus Saturday, a team that walked
all over Stanford's Stadium and all over Stan
ford's track men. To that team goes respect.
There was also a group of Stanford athletes
in the Stadium that day, hardly :i team, but
:i little body of individual performers. To
those men goes more respect.
Now Saturday's meet is on the records, the
point becomes even more obvious that as far
as a dual meet team is concerned, Stanford's
strength is almost nil. Hut in the coining Four
Way Meet and 1.C.4-A.'s it may be a different
story.
That same group of individuals who carried
away live first places against the mighty I'.S.C.
squad can be expected to hold their own in
any competition.
In some events Stanford will have no threat
ening entries at all. Let the other teams fight
for those places. Let them divide I lie points.
In other fields Stanford will enter one
powerful athlete in each. In most cases these
men will he the ones who showed the way
against Troy's aces Saturday. If these few
standouts take lirst places in their events,
which past performances prove they can, all
the other points split between the opposition
will hardly raise any one other scoring col
umn above the Cards'.
There is no doubt about the fact that Stan
ford has not looked very potent as a dual
track team so far this season, hut on May 18
when F.S.C., U.C.L.A., and California come
lo the Stanford Stadium to meet the weak
Indian again, something unexpected may
happen.
