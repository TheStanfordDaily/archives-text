# Rocking the Boat?

### 
Like an uncanny gust out of the blue, a
hesitant Congress' burst of quarrelsomeness
has altered the entire situation in Washing
lon. The pervading atmosphere of enthusi
asm, confidence, and hopefulness that grew
during the time that Roosevelt's leadership
went unchallenged has become humid with
the rising haze of reactionaries on the one
hand and scudding clouds of so-called radi
cals on the other.
Cheerful acceptance has given way to doubt
and controversy since Congress has made a
feint at capturing some degree of supremacy.
Strangely remindful of a little hoy is Con
gress a little boy who has delied his father
and is now waiting with seemingly pleasur
able fear for the parental reaction.
Perhaps now that the administration of that
.*â– '1,800,000,000 work-relief fund is in Roose
velt's grasp, he will he in a position to deal
more effectively with the individual recalci
trant members of Congress, the majority of
whom seek a goodly portion of that fund for
their own states or districts. With such a
measure through the complicated machinery
that is Congress, the President's legislative
program may find fairer weather and facili
tated progress.
Congress has nodded approval lo his steps
until the lame ducks have fallen from the
picture, carrying with them the Presidential
apparatus to reward service lo the adminis
tration and to punish rebellion in the ranks.
Result the Congress of today, more direct
representation, less dictatorship, and more
comparative democracy. Congress gangs up
on Roosevelt. And his power will continue to
dwindle unless, by some quirk of fate, he
arranges a control of spending rugged enough
lo compensate his appointment powers of
I hose lame duck days.
Will the Twentieth Amendment ensnare
F.D.R.? Will Congress pull the strings, in
cluding the purse strings, of the administra-
I ion ?
