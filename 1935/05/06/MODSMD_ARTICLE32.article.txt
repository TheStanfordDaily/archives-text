# School for Politicians?
## 
### 
Members of Stanford's Alumni Association
unanimously voted Saturday to ask the I'ni
versitv to investigate the feasibility of estab- 1
lishinfj a social service departmenl to train
workers in the administration of relief.
Such a department of the I'niversity would
also render another service in that it could 1
more adequately prepare interested students
for worthwhile careers in public service of
all kinds.
The I'niversity offers a compulsory course )
in Citizenship in the lirst year, but there is j
little opportunity for those interested to fol- 1
low out a concentrated course of study and
more than scratch the surface of otir complex
social and political problems.

The founding of such a department as has
been suggested would be a great step in Uu I
direction of a more sane and practical ap- ;
proach lo our political problems and would
place the University definitely in the class of
understanding, liberal educational institu
! lions.
