and goes into the hands of ils .'120(1 readers, ;
Stanford's class of \'l<S will have had its day
i :it the reins of the official student body organ, j
In other words, Ihis is the Freshman Edition.
Not since 1932, when Stan Bcauhaire was
frosh editor, has the Daily been trusted to
lowly freshmen, but through the recent gra- i
ciousness of an obliging Editorial Hoard, onee I
