# CAMPUS TO CAMPUS
## PASSING OF "RAH-RAH" ERA 
### 
According to Dr. Walter A. Jessup, president of ihe
Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teach
ing, "the 'Rah-rah boy' who wont to college to enjoy
life and obtain some social luster, strain his vocal
chords in cheer-gangs, and offer to die for dear old
Alma Mater is disappearing from the campus."
With the "rah-rah" era passing into history,
the college student of today is "interested in world
affairs, government, and social and political econ
omy."
This is shown by the fact that there is a greater
use of college libraries, better conduct of the
former rowdy student, increased interest in politics
and economics, and greater independence W thought
among students.
Dr. Jessup gives hope to the parents of present col
lege students and prospective students in saying that
the college boy "is no longer the blase, sophisticated
student of the 'twenties; he is a hard-working, serious
minded person who demands more of the college li
brary, the laboratory, and the instructor than did his
brother of a decade ago."
And we have the depression to thank for giving us
this reformed youth of America. In the days of plenty,
a dormitory was merely a place to sleep; a classroom,
the place on the campus most infrequently visited.
Professors were regarded as bores who had no par
ticular function; grades were those horrible things
which, unfortunately, had to be sent home to the
family at the end of every quarter.
With the advent of the depi-ession, however, prob
lems arose which had to be faced, and which could
not possibly be solved by the younger generation of a
decade ago. Clear-headed, clean-minded youths were
required to face the issues which are just starting to
fall upon their shoulders.
It became more difficult to be able to attend college,
and when one had the opportunity to go, he had to
work to get by. Less pipe courses were offered in the
curriculum, and more attention was paid to courses in
economics and politics. The same holds true today,
just as it has for ihe past five years.
And prosperity and Joe College walked out of the
picture together, fitting companions for each other.
Since the serious-minded student has taken the fore
most place in the university, the efficient university
must take the lead among its competitors. Dr. Jessup
claims that a struggle for survival among American
colleges can not be avoided. Some of them are destined
to die out because they are fulfilling no educational
purpose.
As soon as these valueless institutions are weeded
out, colleges will be judged "by their success in main
taining themselves as seats of learning for students and
staff. Each college should narrow its curriculum
down to those functions which it can best perform.
Students have now reached the point where they
are not satisfied with units of work, but they want
knowledge that really sticks with them. And with that
type of student prevalent, it can truly be said that
we have outgrown "the rah-rah era of the college boy."
