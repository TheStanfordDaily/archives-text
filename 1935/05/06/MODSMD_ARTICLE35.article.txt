# OUR HASHER SEZ:

### 
Oh woe is me! Oh woe is me! Our Frosher soared
into the editorial offices of The Stanford Daily one fair
afternoon last week and was immediately snagged as
he floated by, by the heavily gloved hand of the frosh
editor. "Foul ball, strike three!" yelled the managing
editor. He did, and when the tumult and fuss had been
wafted away, he pointed a stern and truculent finger
in the face of the stricken one. "You," he muttered.
"You," he chortled. "You!" he shrieked. "YOU!"
"He's just tiying to cow you with a lot of bull!" whis
pered the m.e. And I knew in a moment that the
honors of literary hashing were at last lo become mine.
Before embarking on this hazardous journey I sadly
took leave of my census, my senses, and my centses,
so now, midway between the great hear and the great
their, I greet you with a sad, sad tale of soriow and
horror:
Once upon a time there was a poor little girl who,
after suffering through a supper of Roble's incompar
able (v/e hope) food, betook herself to a certain local
dance accompanied by one of the more conservative
roughs. Following the rat race, during which the l.g.'s
feet encountered untold agonies, the coupie Journeyed
to a certain institution of great renown, slightly beyond
the famous one-and-one-half-mile boundary line.
There she partook of one, shall we say, glass, of milk,
and permitted her terpischorean partner to tread upon
her feet until race-for-lockout-time . . . Great was
her dismay on arriving at the home camping grounds,
to discover that her pedal extremities revolted at the
thought of treading the straight and narrow to the
doorway. And then, as a fitting climax, she was seized
with a violent attack of good old-fashioned hiccups.
All, sad is the fate of the conservative rough!
One of the very greats of our fine institution of
higher learning was recently showing some equally
great visitors through and around the campus. On ar
riving at the Encina pools, he learned to his great dis
may that the faculty swimming was in full swing.
Nothing daunted, he led his little band bravely forth
into the sacred grounds. He pointed out ail the merits
of the illustrious plunges and then, with a grandiose
and all-inclusive gesture, he turned to the bewildered
aquatics hiding behind their beards. In impressive
tones he proclaimed, "The Faculty!" and then swept his
amazed tourists from the pool.
There was a young hasher named Glupff.
Who wrote reprehensible gupff,
He was greatly dismayed when the editor sayed,
"And that, my dear boy, is enupfT!"
