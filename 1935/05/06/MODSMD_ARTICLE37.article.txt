# BULL SESSION
## CAMPUS GABRIEL 
### 
All brunet is David MellinkofT. I
Familiarly known as the most dark |
of Stanford's fair-headed boys, I
Dave's raven qualities are more than i
tonsorial. He sees the campus j
through dark-colored specs, but J
specs tinged with his own intellec
tual pigment.
Dave is a muckraker; but his dis- I
tance from Lincoln Steffenses, the 1
Upton Sinclairs of old, who served
up dirt on a platter of indignation, is
so neatly measured, so carefully
maintained, that were it not for the
lack of a better term, he might es
cape this classification.
Dave is angelic. To harried col- i
lege editors, fated to tread with one
foot on the slick wax of Ex Com- j
mittec favor and with the other on
the rough emery of brain trust judg- j
ment, he is a God-send—one who
can raise hell without dirtying offi- |
cial hands.
When Dave criticizes, his master
ful way of condemning that prompts
steely smiles from his reader and
indulgent chuckles from his victims
places him apart in the college col

i umnists' hall of fame. He has i*eached
[the sophisticated perfection of cru-
I sading journalism. His attacks have
J a flawless technique of safety and
potency, a difficult, essential, and
j exquisitely close harmony of view
! points.
Dave's greatest fault is the fact
! that his rightness is the product of
i that same technique. Reviewing
his columns of the last three months,
can you recall any which approved
lauded, or applauded? If Dave were
i what his style superficially indi
cates, campus affairs and people,
pouring through his mind, would
not invariably land in the negative
; mental basket.
i He has thrown journalistic brim
; stone in the faces and fronts of Stan
| ford's all-high with impunity. It is
not his criticism but its amount and
j constancy that amazes.
The unvarying nature of his at
' tacks may indicate that Dave has
I distorted his mind to fit his job.
After a single experience with his
job, and many with his mind, I be
lieve his job was wrong in the first
place.
