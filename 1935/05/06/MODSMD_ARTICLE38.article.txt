## GOING HOLLYWOOD 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
We have been hearing vague ru
mors to the effect that, though it has
not been officially announced, the
class of 1935 is to graduate on Sun
day, June 16, in the Stadium. It has
even been brought to our attention
that an officer of the senior class
phoned the Quad office, advising
(hem that the date had been
changed, arbitrarily settling a mat
ter upon which the class had no
vote.
Sir, horses for the Fireman's Ball
—sky-writing for the Masque Ball
—now the Stadium for .Commence
ment! Is Stanford going Hollywood
or is Hollywood coming to us? S.C.
graduates in the Coliseum. Los An
geles Junior College awards her
diplomas on the front lawn. U.C.L.A.
trails dustily to the Hollywood Bowl!
When we entered in 1931, Stanford
was conservative to a sufficient de
gree to be above "vulgar display."
Now, only four years later, must
this last tradition go? We do not be
lieve it is sentimentality to prefer
the beautiful and refined Chapel to
the impersonal, open-to-the-public
footbaU stadium.
If there had been a class vote on
this, we would swallow our wrath.
But must Stanford students even
lose the right of self-government?
