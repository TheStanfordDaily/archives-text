# AMEND ELECTION RULES
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Now that the women, through the
Women's Conference, have recog
nized the inherent evils in the pres

j ent election system of selecting
j Masque Ball kings and queens,
j would it not be an appropriate time
! for changing the election rules?
I I propose that, in order to do away
with the snobbish displays of wealth,
leach vote should cost but 10 cents,
! each voter should vote but once, and
each name be crossed off the bawl
, out as in A.S.S.U. elections.
I also propose that, in order to
make the election a more interesting
j and popular event, the women could
i only vote for the men, and the men
j could only vote for the women.
This system would of course re
! duce the Masque Ball's contribu
tion to the Convalescent Home. But
j the Home has already over a quarter
lof a million dollars in bonds. And
: the Masque Ball profits are a very
| small part of ihe Convalescent
Home's income.
1 believe that the present Masque
| Ball king-queen contest does Stan
i ford much more harm than it does
j the Convalescent Home good.
