## 
### 
With prices set on the lowest scale
ever offered by Dramatic Council
for a campus production, tickets for
the play "Yellow Jack," to be pre
sented May 10, will go on sale today
at the Engineering Corner from 10
1o 2 o'clock for 25, 50 and 75 cents.
Ticket sale will continue for the re

The play, which deals with the
conquest of yellow fever, has an
element of comedy as well as of
pathos. The comedy is provided by
four soldiers — a Scotchman, an
Irishman, a Jew, and an Englishman
—who are used as the object of the
experiment conducted to determine
the cause and cure of the disease.
A novel staging device is being
planned, which permits the use of
over 30 different scenes. The mail
order ticket sale has been so suc
cessful that students are urged to
obtain tickets early so that they will
not be disappointed.
