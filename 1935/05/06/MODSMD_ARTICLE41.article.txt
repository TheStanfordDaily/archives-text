"HAYFEVER"—As Presented by
The Menlo J.C. Players
"Hayfever" is one of Noel Cow
; ard's earlier plays. It concerns itself
| with the maniacal carryings-on of
an artistic family of four —entertain-
j ing at their English country-home
j for the week-end. In its sparkling
i wit and humorous situation it's a
i splendid piece of play writing, but it
\ does lack the suaveness and sophis
j tication of Coward's later works.
This same criticism may be di
rected to the Menlo J.C. players'
} presentation of "Hayfever" last
Friday evening at the Palo Alto
; High School Auditorium. Their
: first major production was very en
l tertaining, but it did lack .smooth
ness and finish. The first act was
particularly rough — lines were
j hard to hear, most of the action was
i forced, and climaxes were artificial.
| But by the third act these faults
I were mostly eliminated and the play
concluded with a nice little burst of
enthusiasm on the part of the actors.
The Stanford women showed the
| advantage of their greater dramatic
I activity, for they far outshined the
men. Rosemary Benet, as the actress
mother, proved herself a clever
comedienne, in spite of a most dis
; concerting make-up and a long,
! "trippity" dress in the first act. An
| nelies Morgan did a humorous cock
i ney servant, that is, as to her pan to -
' mime.
Ilen Devlin, as the shy, tearful
j Miss was good, but her failure to
! speak out her lines made it difficult
! to understand what she was saying,
j Jeanette Rosenfeld looked exceed
ingly attractive and appeared more
j at ease in her role than she has in
j previous ones, but she also spoke her
lines so low that she was scarcely
audible. Rosemary Leigh, as the
' modern daughter, gave a clever and
j vivacious characterization. As to the
j men—William Berg, the pompous,
I stiff diplomat, turned in a fine per
! formance. William Maxwell, Rob
i ert Presnell, and Cranston Cham
' berlen took their roles sincerely and
j instilled much comedy into the play.
Waldo Salt, the director, did a
J crcditable job. His single set, which
i used curtain drops, was quite ef
fective and so much more satisfac
| tory than those using cheap and
j badly painted flats. Salt has given
[ a definite style to his coaching
I which might almost be termed flam
, boyant. The difficulty with this is
I that amateur actors, having the di
| rections but not the feeling, will give
forced performances. Of course, this
j is better than having a dull produc
| tion, and it does take finished actors
;to do smooth farce and comedy,
whereas character acting is easier to
teach to amateurs. Luckily for Salt,
i this was not one of Noel Coward's
later plays in which such exagger
' ated pantomime as he employed
would have been badly out of place.
