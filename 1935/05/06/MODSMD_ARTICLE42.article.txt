# Celestial Calm Blasted by Beefy Butch
## 
### 
A fraternity cook given to
screaming is making the row
hideous. He started screaming
last week and he's still going
strongâ€”for he nulled the year's
best dietetic butch, a celestial
dietetic butch, which was sacred
cow even to Ling Po.
A son of the sun is he, who
has given his life to the quan
tity and quality of fraternity
cuisine. And when his knowl
edge of animal flesh was chal
lenged last week, he failed.
A tender, ambrosial piece of
Regret, prize-winning steer of
the San Francisco Junior Live
stock Show, sent to the house
as a special treat by the Stan
ford Wholesale Commissary, he
returned with the words. "Meat
no good,"
Elliott Ayres, commissary
manager, can't understand it.
The cook, disappointed frater
nity brothers believe, passeth
all understanding.
