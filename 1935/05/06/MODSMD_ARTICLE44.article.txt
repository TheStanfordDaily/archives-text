## TROJAN POWER CAN'T SWAMP SAMMY 
### 
Now that the dust l\ps cleared
away and the mighty Trojan has
gone back to his Southern California
lair, the little gang of Indian war
riors are dofTing their head-dresses
to one of their own clan — Sammy
Klopstock.
Sammy's performances Saturday
netted the Card team nearly one
fourth of their total points—he de
serves tribute.
Southern California has hurdlers
by the dozen; they brought five
north to face Stanford's one. In the
highs Sam got a poor start, began to
pull up, and breasted the tape just
a few inches ahead of Phil Cope,
U.S.C.'s ace. One victory for Klop
stock in his favorite race.
Later in the afternoon when Sam
faced a new field of S.C. competitors
in the low sticks it was questionable
whether lie could take another first.
In the last two meets the lows have
proved tougher for Klopstock; Moore
of California made him take second.
But Sammy ran the lows without
a falter and cracked the tape a good
yard ahead of Gil Srother in 23.6.
Competition is Sam's meat and it
was stiff competition that drove him
to both wins and a meet record of
14.4 seconds, three-tenths faster
than the previous mark.
Hand in hand with Klopstock went
Johnny Mottram, whose javelin
heave of 218 feet 1% inches sailed
.slightly less than 6 feet over the
former mark held by himself.
