# TWO WERE VICTORIOUS â€”TWO WEREN'T
## 
### 
Four members of last year's
seven-man winning 1.C.4-A. team
were on the field for Stanford Sat
urday. Two of those, Klopstock and
Mottram, topped the columns in their
events but the other pair were less
fortunate.
Captain A1 Blackmail and Chuck
Nimmo were those two.
Blackman had a tough time Sat
urday. His chief competitor, John
McCarthy, took the pole early in
the event and A1 spent the remain
der of the 440 trying to get around
McCarthy's fleet heels. Around the
turn and into the straightaway the
two battled but when A1 came to
apply the sprint, the sprint just
wouldn't come. That outside posi
tion around the turn had proved too
much.
Then to make things even more
unbearable Jim Cassin slipped past
Blackman to chalk up second. A1 is
capable of better but it's no great
disgrace to take a good third to a
47.5.
Chuck Nimmo almost proved him
self to be a dark horse against the
Trojan 880 force. All season Chuck
has been struggling to get back into
his last season condition and Satur
day it looked as though he were go
ing to demonstrate with a victory.
Troy's runners were a trifle fast for
Chuck; best he could net was a
third but they were worried during
the whole race.
Last week in training Nimmo
turned in a 1.55, a time never made
public; which clipped three seconds
off his clocking of the previous Sat
urday. Then against Troy he cut
n to 1:54. At this rate Chuck can be
expected to crash the winning col
umns soon.
