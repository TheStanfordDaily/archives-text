# THIS HIGH JUMPER BROWNE, WHO IS HE?
## 
### 
There was a lanky high jumper :
out on the field Saturday competing i
in his first big meet. Spectators |
watched him clear (> feet with ease, i
wondered where Dink had been j
keeping him. They watched "Hum" j
Smith slide over six one and the ,
newcomer after him.
Thon the bar went up to 6 feet
2 inches and neither Smith nor the
lanky jumper could quite make it; !
both stopped there while their op
ponent, S.C.'s Spicer, went on up to
win the event.
Who was this fellow, this new man
who stuck with Smith to tic for
' L'cond? Millard Browne was his
name, the same Browne who filled
this column last fall when he was
Daily sports editor.
"Browney," as his friends call him, j
has always liked to high jump, but '
he likes writing sports ju.st a little
better. Last Wednesday he was out
on the Angell Field pit just "play- 1

ing around" when Dink noticed !
him, decided to give him a try. He j
says he was lucky to place at all |
but after observing his natural abil- j
ity out there Saturday one can't i
help wondering if Djnk won't try to j
talk him into making sports head- j
lines instead of writing them.
