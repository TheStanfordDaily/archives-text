## CARDINAL PLAYERS RALLY NEAR END TO WIN FROM S.C. Cards Gain Intercollegiate Supremacy of Coast 
### Herb Diamond 
j Finding their stride after what
proved to be four periods of nip and i
tuc,k battle, Lieut. H. Y. Grubbs' In
dian poloists conquered the riders 1
from Troy, 7-4, Friday afternoon at
the highway field.
Twice during the contest the
Stanford squad found itself trail
ing, but each time the stellar driv
ing of Captain Bill Rogers, at his
usual No. 2 position, and Bob Ful
lerton, No. 4. evened the score.
Af the beginning of the fifth pe
riod the scoreboard read 4-4, the re- j
suit of neck-and-neck tallying. It ;
was then that the Cardinals rallied !
to the occasion, with Rogers, Fuller- |
ton, and Carl Beal collecting a total '
of four goals in close succession,
i During the final period neither .squad
scored.
Troy Handicapped
The Trojan outfit, although pow
i erful, was handicapped by strange 1
mounts and proved a trifle inex- j
perienced for the Indians. George
Beekley, No. 1, accounted for two j
points of the S.C. total; Captain Don j
| Spiers, riding at No. 3, drove one |
home; and Bob Shaw, substituting j
for Jack Warner at No. 2, garnered ;
j another. Beekley turned in a great I
; performance, covering the entire i
field, and causing no end of trouble
j for Stanford.
j The southern institution boasts :
one of the leading polo aggregations
in the state,- having collected easy ,
victories over California and U.C. [
LA. They, however, bowed to the
Arizona Wildcats by a 16-6 count, J
while Stanford was thrice downed I
| by the Arizonans to the tune of 13-3,
10-0, and 9-4.
Indians Come Through
The Indians, in topping the Tro- 1
| jans, lived up to pre-game expecta- i
tions which were doped on a basis 1
j of comparative scores and past per- I
i l'ormances. Smarting under thej
fsound drubbings administered them .
1 by Arizona's invincible quartet, the j
Farm mallet-swingers vowed ven- !
geance and came through in their '
1 campaign to establish Coast inter- !
collegiate polo supremacy.
The line-up, with the exception of 1
No. 3 Russ Rasmussen, was complete, i
Rasmussen's injured knee kept him j
!on the sidelines. Jim Henderson, j
I who took Fullerton's place in the
j first two Arizona encounters, Ed Mc
| Keon ,and John Dwyer, second
! string men, failed to see service in
! the contest.
The summary follows:
Stanford (7)
Enemark (No. 1) 0 I
Rogers (No. 2) .'. 3 J
, Beal (No. 3) II
! Fullerton (No. 4) 3 i
S.C. (4)

i Spiers (No. 3) II
