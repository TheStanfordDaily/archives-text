j Earl Hoos at quarterback; Doc Luck-
I ett, Ray Lewis, Bill Paulman, Ken
j Peters, Jimmy Coffis, Tom Collins,
j Joe Vigna, and Howard Erlenheim at
i half; and Paulman again at full with

Freshman Combination
Coach Thornhill is planning to try
! out an all-freshman backfield this
; week which will be made lip of
; Holdridge at quarterback, Paulman
: and Collins at the halfback potts,
j and Hamilton at fullback.
Giving about 50 perspiring aspir
ants for positions on the 1935 Indian
lootball machine a chance to show
j their talents, Coach Tiny Thornhill
put his men through a scrimmage
session Friday afternoon. Familiar
; laces of the 1934 squad which were
: missing included Claude Callaway,
I Bob Black, and Johnny Reisner.
i Callaway is not in school at the
present time, and it Ls doubtful if he
j will be playing next year. Reisner,
1 who is being boosted for halfback,
was a spectator on the sidelines. He
1 has an injured foot received in prac
! tice the other day and will be out
I for a day or two.
Add to First String
Coach Thornhill had four pros
: pective teams lined up. He scrim
' maged the first against the third and
had the second meeting the fourth.
I Frank Alustiza, Bones Hamilton,
; and Bob Grayson, in addition to Wil
liams, made up the backfield which,
with the exception of the one half
! back post, looks like a certain first
j string backfield for next season. The
line was composed of Monk Moscrip,
' Bob Reynolds, Woody Adams, Alf
j Brandin, Larry Rouble, Dale Beedle,
' and Keith Topping.
