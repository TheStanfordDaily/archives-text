### 
ISTANBUL, May 5 (/P). â€”'Tens of
thousands of inhabitants of the Kars
regions of the Turko-Russian fron
tier, terrified by recurring earth
shocks rumbling in the wake of a
disastrous earthquake, wandered
dazedly over the countryside to
night.
Many were in dire need of food
and medical attention. Scores of
corpses were still believed buried in
the debris of shattered homes and
many towns and villages.
