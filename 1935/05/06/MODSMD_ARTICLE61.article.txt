## 
### 
Old Boy Gordy Steedman an
nounces that the May of the
Chappie will be out this Thursday.
The comic this month is devoted to
the beautiful theme of love â€” love
poems, love nonsense, and, just for
the joy of it, a Love Questionnaire
(to see if there are any real lovers
on the campus!) being featured.
Steedman wishes that the question
naire be in no way confused with
the College Aptitude Test, though
the subject matter may be similar.
Results of the "Loveliest Girl"
contest will be published in this
issue.
Contributors include Dorman
Smith, outstanding cartoonist; Jim
Copp with his "Ask the Copp" col
umn again; Jack Sfcott, who advo
cates his own contest for the Ugliest
Campus Co-ed.
