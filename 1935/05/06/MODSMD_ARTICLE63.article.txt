"THE WEDDING NIGHT"
At the Stanford Theater
This is one of the finest pictures
seen in Palo Alto (or anywhere else
for that matter) this year. "Bengal
Lancer" Gai'y Cooper and the ex
quisite Anna "Nana" Sten give per-

formances not
soon to be for
gotten.
The story con
cerns a fast
decaying novel
ist's retreat to
the Connecticut
country with his

wife, lack of funds prohibiting his

I remaining in the big city. A Polish
• family, neighbors of the newcomers,
furnishes the writer with material
i for a new book, and from this point
l the story takes on a new angle.
Tony (the writer) and Manya (the
Polish daughter) become the Ste-
I phan and Sonya in the novelist's
work. The closing scenes of the pic-
I ture are delicately directed and mag
j nificently acted.
Perhaps it is the intelligently re
j strained acting of the principals that
! encourages those in lesser roles to
j outplay anything they have done in
i the past. Helen Vinson portrays
; Dox*a, the wife, with an understand
| ing heretofore unassociated with her;
Ralph Bellamy as Manya's sweet
j heart makes his few entrances vital
' ones.
I This is one picture to put on your
I "not miss" list.

"SHADOW OF DOUBT"

| Also at the Stanford
There isn't a shadow of doubt that j
i this picture (which tries to combine i
| every mystery from "The Phantom
| of the Opera" to "The Cat and the
i Canary") is one of the biggest pieces
lof tripe served lately. Ricardo Cor- j
j tez, who doesn't look a day over
' 45, is his usual stiff-shirt self in the j
| "juvenile" lead. The monotony is !
I relieved (all too seldom) by the i
j blond loveliness of Virginia Bruce. |
