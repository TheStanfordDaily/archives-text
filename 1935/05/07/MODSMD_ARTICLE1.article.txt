# LONDON CROWD OFFERS TRIBUTE TO ROYAL PAIR
## King Receives Benediction From Archbishop In Impressive Rites NEWCASTLE MOB RIOTS Thirty-Seven Injured Along Procession Route 
### 
LONDON, May G (/P). — King
George V of England knelt today
with th 6 reverence of a humble pil
grim in ancient St. Paul's Cathedral
to give thanks to God for comple
tion of 25 years on the throne, while
all his vast empire celebrated his
jubilee with mingled prayers and
merrymaking.
So tempestuous was the shouted
acclaim that rolled along with him
as his state procession proceeded
from Buckingham Palace to the ca
thedral and back that the King was
apparently stirred deeply.
Queen Mary was as deeply af
fected by the thunderous ovations.
Observers along the route thought
they detected tears in her eyes.
The day's most touching moment
came in the cathedral when the
King-Emperor, his right hand over
his brow, knelt while the Archbishop
of Canterbury pronounced his bless
ing and at its conclusion, oblivious
to others rising about him, remained
on bended knee as if offering one
final touch of personal prayer.
Subdued alike by grey shadows
of the cathedral and the humility
of King and Queen were the crim
sons, golds, silvers and ermines
worn by dignitaries of the empire
and representatives of almost all
(lie nations of the world gathered
in St. Paul's for the thanksgiving.
For Englishmen, whose love for
their monarch derives in great, part
from his simplicity and lack of os
tentation, the ceremony provided
one homely touch to be cherished.
After the prayer the King—like
any British grandfather—put on his
glasses and looked through the pro
gram to refresh his memory on or
der of the service.
In the clock-like movement of the
day's program there were only minor
mishaps.
At Newcastle some (>ft persons
were injured in collapse of a stand
overloaded with spectators watch
ing a military parade.
Communists, who had boasted
loudly of counter demonstrations
they were planning, managed to
break out a banner almost over the
King's landau bearing the slogan:
"Workers of Our Land, Unite
Against Capitalism."
Hospitals handled 37 cases result
ing from the crush of many hun
dreds of thousands jamming routes
of the state processions, while an
ambulance corps of . r >o doctors, 1000
nurses and 3000 orderlies treated
713!) persons who fainted, sprained
their ankles, or otherwise were in
jured.
