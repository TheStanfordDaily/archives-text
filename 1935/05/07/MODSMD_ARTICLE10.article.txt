Neither Is Stanford immune
from the send-a-dime chain
letter skin-game.
Like nearly every other post
office in the West, Stanford's
reports an increase in the num
ber of pieces of mail handled
during few weeks. And
at this time of year the chain
letters are the only things to

attributed.
"I got one of the things to
day." "I got three now."—can
be heard in nearly every living
group. Hundreds have come to
the Farm. But most hit the
waste basket, inquiries show.
Most students don't know
whether to send dimes or laugh.
Tlie report of the Paly citizerfs
who cashed in $70 worth of ten
cent pieces, and the statement
of the learned mathematician
who figured it out that you
can't win neutralize arguments.
But the student who has made
any real money off the chain
has yet to be heard of.
