# Senate May Favor Full Payment of Cash Bonus
## 
### 
, WASHINGTON, May 6 (/P).—Ap
| parcntly certain Senate passage of a
full cash bonus measure, despite
veto warnings, stood out in bold re- •
lief today against an administration
legislative program shadowed by a
vital Supreme Court ruling.
Senate leaders, conceding their
j week-end efforts to work out a
i bonus compromise had collapsed,
I showed more concern over the fu-
I ture of President Roosevelt's Social
Security Program and the proposed
j extension of NRA. Hastily, they
1 sought to measure the outlooks for
; both in the light of the legal stand
ards on which the high court held
j the railway retirement act uncon
stitutional.
