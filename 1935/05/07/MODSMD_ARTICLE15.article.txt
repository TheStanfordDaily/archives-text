# DISCUSSION ON STUDENT RULE SET THURSDAY
## Wilbur To Speak; Students And Faculty Will Ask Questions 
### 
Perplexing problems, current
; monkey wrenches in the machinery
; of student government administra
j tion—and a vital issue in the eyes of
: A.S.S.U. President Marvie Kahn —
will be the targets at which ques
tions will be fired and views aired
in a semi-panel discussion to be held
at the Little Theater Thursday eve
ning at 7:30 o'clock.
Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur is to be
the speaker of the evening, present
ing his ideas and philosophy of effi
cient student government. Dr. Wil
bur will come to the meeting pre
pared to answer the barrage of
questions invited and expected from
j members of the audience and Dr.
i Curtis Hand, Miss Louise Price,
! Dean Mary Yost, Dave Mellinkoff,
| Kenneth Livingston, and Kahn, who
will give .supplementary talks.
Open to All
j The discussion, coming as a direct
outgrowth of the first Pi Lambda
j Theta forum on student government,
j is open to all members of the stu
! dent, body and faculty. As many as
I possible, urges Kahn, should attend
I this meeting which, in his opinion,
! will doubtlessly prove of vital im-
{ porlance.
Included in the various phases of
the general topic will be student
government relations, progress of
government, and the qualifications
ol future office holders. Student gov
ernment in universities lias and will
I continue to take on added functions
irapidly.
Problems Increase
Its administration, it is felt, has
j come to resemble a science, in which
only those thoroughly familiar with
its problems will be able to ap
proach maximum efficiency. Fur
thermore, says Kahn, student gov
erning bodies must constantly be
aware of and able to cope with in
i creasing problems which inevitably
I accompany added functions. Many
J of such problems will bo enumerated
j by Dr. Wilbur and commented upon.
J Questioning, which will feature
.the meeting, is to be open to both
! the audience and the eight student
| and faculty members previously
| named. It will begin at the conclu-
I sion of Dr. Wilbur's talk.
