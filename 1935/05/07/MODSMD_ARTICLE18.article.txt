# Kipling Wrong: Females Not So 'Deadly' on Turf
## 
### CEDRIC LARSON 
Carrying on, as it were, the Stan
ford tradition of experiments with
fine horse-flesh on the "Palo Alto
Stock Farm," Dr. Calvin P. Stone of
the psychology department, has
completed researches which clearly
establishes the superiority of male
thoroughbred horses on the track
over females, disproving in one realm
at least the famous line of Rudyard
Kipling: "The female of the species
is more deadly than the male."
Study Covers 25 Years
The cxperimepts covered sex dif
ferences in the speed of thorough
breds from records available for the
years from 1908 to 1932.
In stake races, which are crucial
tests of speed, stamina and tempera
ment, Professor Stone found only 22
per cent of the winning horses dur
ing the period 192 3to 1929 were fe
males, when 2,400 stake races were
lun on the principal American
tracks.
In 1932 mares and fillies won 24
per cent of all races, but only 19 per
cent of those in open competition
with males. The ratio 1:4 correctly
indicates the relative frequency of

I winning by males and females in this
category of race.
Males Are Champions
The psychologist found that 8(> per
cent of all racing records established
from 15)08 to 1932 were made by
j stallions and geldings, indicating the
superiority of the male. Fifty dis
tances from 440-yards to four miles
were studied.
No female has ever been timed on
the mile at 1:35 or less, although four
| males have achieved this impressive
speed. Equipoise did it in 1:34.4 with
an impost of 128 pounds. The female
impost is mostly lighter than the
male, usually 115 pounds for a race
ir which the minimum speed for
' entrance must be 1:37.

Among Senator Leland Stanford's
prized personal possession was a
gold-headed wooden walking stick,
with effigies of his best race horses
carved on it, and a horseshoe at the
top of the shaft bearing the words
'Good Luck." The university
founder's interest in turfdom adum
brates the great fascination which
this form of sport has in all parts of
America today.

In 1932 mares and fillies won 24
per cent of all races, but only 19 per
cent of those in open competition
with males. The ratio 1:4 correctly
indicates the relative frequency of

I winning by males and females in this
category of race.
Males Are Champions
The psychologist found that 8(> per
cent of all racing records established
from 15)08 to 1932 were made by
j stallions and geldings, indicating the
superiority of the male. Fifty dis
tances from 440-yards to four miles
were studied.
No female has ever been timed on
the mile at 1:35 or less, although four
| males have achieved this impressive
speed. Equipoise did it in 1:34.4 with
an impost of 128 pounds. The female
impost is mostly lighter than the
male, usually 115 pounds for a race
ir which the minimum speed for
' entrance must be 1:37.
i Senior Stanford's Ilobby
Among Senator Leland Stanford's
prized personal possession was a
gold-headed wooden walking stick,
with effigies of his best race horses
carved on it, and a horseshoe at the
top of the shaft bearing the words
'Good Luck." The university
founder's interest in turfdom adum
brates the great fascination which
this form of sport has in all parts of
America today.
Carrying on, as it were, the Stan
ford tradition of experiments with
fine horse-flesh on the "Palo Alto
Stock Farm," Dr. Calvin P. Stone of
the psychology department, has
completed researches which clearly
establishes the superiority of male
thoroughbred horses on the track
over females, disproving in one realm
at least the famous line of Rudyard
Kipling: "The female of the species
is more deadly than the male."
Study Covers 25 Years
The cxperimepts covered sex dif
ferences in the speed of thorough
breds from records available for the
years from 1908 to 1932.
In stake races, which are crucial
tests of speed, stamina and tempera
ment, Professor Stone found only 22
per cent of the winning horses dur
ing the period 192 3to 1929 were fe
males, when 2,400 stake races were
lun on the principal American
tracks.
