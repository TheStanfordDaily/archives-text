# Faville Talks Over Air On Costs, Prices
## Distribution Discussed By Radio Speaker 
### 
Professor David E. Faville of the
Graduate School of Business spoke
over station KGO last night on the
Stanford Hour, choosing as his sub
ject "Behind the Scenes with the
Distributor."
Dr. Faville attacked the common
ideas that distribution costs are un
duly high and the consumer is being
charged exorbitant prices for ar
ticles that cost only a fraction of
their selling prices. He pointed out
that many services arc demanded by
the consumer, adding to prices.
Data Hard To Obtain
The speaker stated that cost re
duction data are both difficult and
costly to obtain, particularly during
a depression, when there is little
money available for such work, and
when it is most needed.
Professor Faville added that mar
keting costs on the .whole have not
increased in such fabulous propor
tions as the public believes. On the
contrary, he pointed out that often
it is not so much that distribution
costs have increased, but that pro
duction costs have declined and
marketing costs have remained sta
tionary.
High Prices Justified
In conclusion he stated that tem
porary high prices may bo justified,
as in the case of a new product be
ing introduced into general use when
it is necessary to increase distribu
tion costs by adding salesmanship
and advertising.
"However," said Professor Faville,
"services do add to the cost of mar
keting. They may be useful services
or they may represent the waste of
our present system, but it is largely
up to the consumer to decide wheth
er or not they are worth while."
