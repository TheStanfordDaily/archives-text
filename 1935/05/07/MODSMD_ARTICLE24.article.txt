# Ex Committee Discusses Masque Ball Fate Tonight
## Control of Dramatic Council Will Be Discussed 
### 
The future status of the Masque
Ball Contest, the binder dividers
proposition, and the Dramatics
Council may all be decided by Ex
Committee tonight.
These three involved matters will
keep Stanford's legislative body so
busy that they may not be able to
decide all of them tonight.
Conference Today
What Ex Committee will decide
about the Dramatics Council is de
pendent upon the results of today's
conference between President Ray
Lyman Wilbur and the Ex Commit
tee composed of Marvie Kahn, A1
Blackman, Henry Brill, Frank Ful
lenwider, and Bill Stark.
The committee will try to find
what the Administration's attitude is
toward proposed faculty control of
Dramatics and the effect that con
tinued student control as personified
by the present Dramatic Council
would have on the Stanford School
of the Theater.
Leaders Present
Ex Committee's reaction to Wom
en's Conference unanimous resolu
tion to do away with the Masque
Ball King and Queen Contest will be
aired in the old Union Committee
Room. Present will be Marion Storey
of Women's Conference to give her
views and Will Eisner to present the
attitude of the Convalescent Home
Drive Committee.
The fate of the binder dividers
was discussed yesterday afternoon at
a meeting of Kahn, Student Man
ager Cave, and Publications Council
head Gordon Stcednuin. Results of
the forum will be revealed tonight.
Successors to Sam Lee and Helen
Ray, members of the Student Aid
Committee whose terms have ex
pires, will also be appointed.
