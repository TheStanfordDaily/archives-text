# 17 HOUSES NOW AGREE ON BAN OF HELL WEEK
## Resolution Disapproved By Three Greek Groups In Recent Poll FOUR YET TO VOTE Measure Would Save Pledge From Possible Danger 
### Frank Orr 
Three more fraternities fell into
line last night and banned Hell Week
as part of their initiation activities,
bringing the total so far to 17 out of.
the 24 existing houses. Four had not
been heard from on the Interfrater
nity Board's resolution, and three
had disapproved it.
Thus Stanford Greeks moved even
closer to a more sensible <jnd effec
tive initiation method, following the
practice which has been acted on by
fraternity men in many of the more
progressive American universities.
Pledge Exempt ,
By the new conception of initia
tions, the pledge will be exempted
from activities which in the past
have injured his health and scholar
ship and subjected him to physical
danger, as well as injuring the repu
tation of the house and of the Uni
versity.
The four not yet heard from last
night had meetings late or were to
consider them later in the week;
and Row leaders expected to have
21 of the 24 fraternities signed up be
fore (he next Interfratemity Coun
cil meeting, to be held later in the
week.
Resolution Introduced
The resolution, originally intro
duced by the Interfratemity Board
of Control, reads as follows:
"Whereas, the practices involved
in Hell Week have, in our opinion,
proven themselves distinctly in
jurious to the initiate, both in health
and in scholarship; whereas, these
practices have tended to promote
internal friction within the frater
nity; and whereas, they have been
proven harmful to the prestige of
Stanford University, we, the under
signed, by a vote of the majority of
the members of the house, do de
clare that. Hell Week is hereby elim
inated from our fraternity initiation
program."
