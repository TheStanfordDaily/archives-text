# Naturalist Gives Moving Picture Address Tonight
## Dr. Ales Hrdlicka To Speak In Assembly Hall On Alaskan Trips Anthropology To Be Topic Of Talk by Curator 
### 
"Results of Recent Explorations in
Alaska" will be the subject of a
motion picture lecture to be given
by Dr. Ales Hrdlicka, curator of the
Division of Physical Anthropology of
the Smithsonian Institution, tonight
at 7:30 o'clock in the Assembly Hall.
According to Dr. Hrdlicka, the
chief deduction of American anthro
pology is that this continent was
peopled essentially from northeast
ern Asia.
Reasons Stated
The deduction is based on the
facts that man could not have orig
inated in the New World and hence
must have come to it from the Old;
that the American aborigines arc
throughout of one fundamental race,
the nearest relatives of which exist
to this day over wide parts of north
er nancl eastern Asia; and that the
only practicable route for man in
such a cultural stage was that be
tween northeastern Asia and Alaska.
There still remain important de
tails to be solved, Dr. Hrdlicka be
lieves, such as how man came to
America, what he brought with him
in the lines of language, culture,
and physique, how he proceeded in
peopling the continent after he
reached it, and what is the genetic
relation of the Eskimo and the In
dian.
Trips Enlightening
New light has been shed on these
questions by the explorations in the
far northwest carried on under the
;iuspices of the Smithsonian Institu
tion under the direction of Dr. Hrd
licka, who has been working on the
project for the last six years.
Dr. Hrdlicka will take up these
questions and the bearing of his re
cent explorations upon them. The
lecture will be well illustrated with
films and lantern slides.
