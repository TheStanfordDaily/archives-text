# Kings and Queens: Is a Change Needed?
## 
### 
A nice question makes ils appearance lo
nighl at the weekly ISx Committee conclave.
II resolves itself simply to, "Should we have
a King and Queen contest in the future, and if
so, should it he run along the same lines, or
should il he changed?"
There are many angles to he stressed. In
a former editor's words, when commenting
on any campus situation, "the setup is all
wrong." In the present dilliculty, granted
that there is one, the problem is to distinguish
as (o the true worth of an annual campaign
to elect a Queen (ignoring the King contest,
for it is merely a small sideshow) and to
determine whether it actually helps the Con
valescent Home, or whether il acts merely as
salve for a lot of inflated egos.
Poor old Kx Committee will lake a heating
in considering such a problem. II laces a
situation where a real money-making enter
prise is on the carpet. This year's sum may
be considered negligible for the ballyhoo and
objectionable features which followed in ils
wake. Still, to directors who administer the
Home, two thousand dollars is a tidy sum,
and will go far toward helping some.small
individuals at the Convalescent Home.
There is no doubt that the King-Queen con
test could use considerable revision, lint such
:i contest is deemed valuable, and unless some
belter system can be devised, it would he un
wise lo rule out the present one. II is a lime
for some campus genius lo come to the aid of
:i harassed situation.
