# No Need for a Press in Germany
## 
### 
Submerged by the headlined news emanat
ing from Germany is the decree of Max
Ainann, president <Â»l the Nazi press guild,
which brushes aside the last vestige of inde
pendence of the German press. This latest
stroke of Hitlerism is further indication of
:t tightening of the moustached dictator's grip
011 the fatherland.
It seeks to smash newspaper trusts not
within the Nazi ranks and to bar all .lews from
controlling or holding an interest in publish
ing concerns. Excluded from the newspaper
profession are all persons unable to prove
their own or their spouses' non-Jewish origin
hack to the year ItSIM). The Ainann guild,
furthermore, gains control of the appointment
of publishers, editors, and their representa
tives.
This suppression move is analogous to the
Stanford Ex Committee's announcing that no
student could be editor of the Daily who hap
pened to break a window during his freshman
days at Encina such an individual would
he dangerous in the editor's chair and a detri
mental influence to the Administration's in
terest.
