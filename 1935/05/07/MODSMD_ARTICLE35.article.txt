# Sometimes Freshmen Surprise
## 
### 
Yesterday morning an edition of the Stan
i oiii) Daily made its usual appearance. There '
was nothing about it to suggest any variation
from the ordinary morning paper, besides the
two little "ears" proclaiming a freshman edi
tion.
This little journalistic experiment, con- j
ducted for the first time since 1032, proves
many things. For one, il proves that many
people who feel that they are a necessary ad
junct to everything that goes on, arc vastly I
mistaken.
A handful of freshmen took over the entire
editorial reins and whipped through an edi
tion in record style. Such experience suppo
sedly takes two or three years of preliminary
training before the student is considered qual
ified. Still, here was a contradiction of that
old idea. And the same thing holds true for
every campus activity. It is doubtful whether
the freshman class could muddle up politics
any worse than do the seniors and juniors
who predominate school activities.
And so this morning the Daily drops back
"into insignificance," so we are told. Not,
however, without the feeling that if the fresh- i
men on the Farm are as talented in every
activity as they have proved themselves news
paper-wise, the campus has nothing to fear
for some four vears to come.
