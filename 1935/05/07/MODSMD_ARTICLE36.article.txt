# Hell Week Still on the Wane
## 
### 
Three more fraternities join flic ranks of
the progressives, bringing the tola! of houses
banning Hell Week to seventeen, with four
not yet reported. Only three so far have indi- '
rated disapproval.
And so the march of progress awav from j
the medieval lorture-ehamber conception of |

; initiations goes on, and within a week the
i remainder of the fraternities should be signed
up on the Interlraternity Hoard resolution.
Much more sensible in tone is the initiation
procedure now being mapped out by many
organizations. Study of fraternity and t'ni
: versity history and data, house work, and
other constructive activities, when substituted
i lor paddling and "quests," should vastly im
prove the average outsider's estimation of
fraternity men.
