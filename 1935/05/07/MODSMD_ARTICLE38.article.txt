## AUTONOMOUS INDIA: CHAMAN LAI 
### CEDRIC LARSON 
While King George V of Great Britain celebrates
with eclat his silver jubilee in London, India seethes
wilh unrest.
Ghaman Lai, disciple of Ghandi, and political corre
spondent for the Hindustan Times of Delhi, India, who
is sojourning a few days in Palo Alto, believes there is
ample evidence that this may be the last time a British
sovereign at his silver jubilee can style himself "Em
peror of India."
Although Canada, Australia and New Zealand have
achieved Dominion status and are practically self
governing nations, Chaman Lai does not believe that
India can ever successfully follow the political footsteps
of the other British overseas possessions.
Dominion status cyinot be achieved in India
since race, customs, and language of :)50,000,000
people differ radically from that of their Euro
pean masters. The traditions of Canada, New
Zealand and Australia were the same as those of
the mother country, making the question of
equality with the island kingdom a relatively sim
ple matter. Nothing short of complete autonomy
sail satisfy India. If India were made a self-gov
erning member of the British commonwealth of
nations, it would he only logical to move the
capital from London to Delhi, where most of the
people are, else the imperial tail, so to say, would
w:\g the dog.
England fights desperately to retain India for it
means not only about a fifth of her overseas trade,
but manufacturing and shipping jobs for eight to twelve
million Britons. India is the base for a flourishing
commerce with China, and the strategic locus com
manding the ocean highway to the vast continent of
Australia, New Zealand and a host of Pacific Islands.
Chaman Lai is an admirer of Japan, and has writ
ten a book entitled: "Secrets of Japan," the thesis of
which is that if India had enjoyed independence such
as Nippon has had during the past two generations,
India would now be a vigorous Asiatic power in her
own right.
The Delhi journalist sees in the spare, ascetic
Ghandi India's chief hope. The Mahatma now has a
great reform program under way, including compul
sory education throughout India, abolition of the
caste system, economic independence for every indi
gent inhabitant of India, particularly the 80 per cent
of the population who live in the 700,000 villages of
the huge peninsula, and the introduction of elementary
sanitation throughout India. "Untouchability is fast
dying under the impact of Ghandi's no-caste associa
tions springing up all over India," declares the Hin
dustan Times correspondent.
The old argument of disunited India without
British control always comes home to roost when
Indian independence is broached. CJwnan Lai de
clares that with an Indian federal rcpuhlic such as
the United States there would he no such danger.
The present friction between Moslems, Hindus,
Sikhs is inspired largely through the ruling bu
reaucrats in India, he avers, who wish to main
tain the status quo.
State education as envisioned by Ghandi supplant
ing the present religious clique instruction would go
a long way toward abolishing the internecine strife in
India, as well as wipe out the disgraceful fact that after
two centuries of British sway literacy in India is only
about 10 per cent, he points out.
Chaman Lai states the new Indian constitution will
not prove satisfactory. The franchise is by religious
categories, and the present bureaucracy will merely
change its plumage but not its plunder under the
proposed set-up. .
Since America gets its news about India from Lon
don, the United States sees the situation through Brit
ish spectacles, the journalist declares. "Nothing on
earth can stop nationalism in India," the champion of
India's freedom predicts, and states his belief that an
other decade will see the objective of an autonomous
India realized.
