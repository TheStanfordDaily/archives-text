# OUR HASHER SEZ:
## 
### 
For two times now women have taken over this
worthwhile column, once for the Women's Edition and
once for yesterday's Freshman Edition. I think that
all those worthwhile gentlemen who are the purvey
ors and conveyors of the necessary sustenances, in
short, the hashers, will agree with me that the day
of the woman hasher is definitely over. Such a change
may lead to the class struggle and social chaos, but
hashers have been to jolly-ups before.
Upon pain of death and threats of social ostracism,
terrorism, and astigmatism I must tell the tale of the
dissolution of one of the more prominent Entente
Cordiale's of the campus.
It was one of those alliances that was never going
to die. True love had at last come to the campus.
But alas, fate would not let it be so.
The lady is one of the Roble hierarchy and appar
ently heiress to the "I spirit of the old 500,
anyway, she ruled the dark and Gloomy Moore, who
is the hero of our story, with an ironic hand.
The course of true love was very smooth, until
the Moore asked the love to attend the house dance
that a fraternity was giving in May.
The love replied that she was sorry, but she already
a date. The Moore, being curious, next encountered
the fair one at the Convalescent Home Driv£ jolly-up,
and was immediately consumed with desire to find out
who the man that had the date with his other soul was.
Consequently, he asked a pledge of this fraternity
to ask the lady for a date, and upon receiving a nega
tion, to ask her who the dastardly man was. The pledge,
being pressed into service, sallied out on the floor,
tapped the necessary shoulder, asked for the date, and
got this answer: "I'd love to go."
The result is-now most interesting to behold. The
full workings of the defense reaction can be seen
brought into ploy. Instead of the Moore's vowing
eternal vengeance, the lady broke off all relations with
the Moore, because of the humiliation, and war has
been declared.
