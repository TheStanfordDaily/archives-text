# BULL SESSION
## OF CABBAGES AND THINGS 
### 
Every cud-chewing cow has her
hey day; every dog has his day;
and—oh yes, we had almost forgot
ten—every Stanford freshman has
his Frosh Edition of The Daily.
And now that '38 has laid naked
its hitherto inscrutable soul, we may
pass from the mental Doukhobors of
Encina to the itching problems of
the moment.
While a certain "beauty" salon is
offering to turn Stanford women
into "Glorified Ziegfeld Beauties''
(so help me, that's what the ad said),
Women's Conference and a certain
Campus Opinioner are worried over
the fate of Stanford women as they
are today. More especially are Con
ference and the Campus Opinioner
certain that the Masque Ball King-
Queen Contest—as at present con
stituted—are detrimental to the eth
ics of Farm co-eds and the honor
of the name of "Stanford."
Tonight the question of whether
the Masque Ball Contest is to be,
or not to be, will be thrown open
for discussion in Stanford's own
little cave of the winds—the Ex
Committee. Ex Committee will hear
it said that the contest stimulates
unnecessary friction between Row
and Hall, that it blackens the beam
ing blue eyes of Stanford, that it
makes five blades of snobbishness
grow where but one grew before.
To the argument that noble or
ignoble, the contest this year netted
$2,050 for the cirppled children of
the Convalescent Home will come
the retort righteous: The ends do
not justify the means.
We do not believe that any ends
justify any means. But when, with
only one week ot hysteria, the con
test alone (exclusive of other bene
fits) can bring good food, good
housing, and good medication to
several of the children of,'
San Francisco's poor districts, we!
believe that the fuss is worth the
feathers. Short of mayhem and mur
der, it is worth putting up with al
most any bedlam for the sake of a
good cause.

Any schemes for reform (such us j
the dime-a-throw enigma of yes
.terday's Campus Opinion) tend to |
remove the appeal-to-vanity inher- j
| ent in the contest, emasculate the '
; contest, and make it worthless. As j
has been said before, the real merit j
j of the Masque Ball Contest lies in j
i the fact that it capitalizes on the j
j vanity of male and female, and turns'!
i1 ho proceeds to the relief of the j
! needy. The flurry over Masque Ball j
| lasts but a short while; the money j
j that it brings works lasting good. !
The contest should be continued.
