# CAMPUS OPINION
## DO PROFESSORS WORK? 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Thy debunking of ''the typical col
lege prof" in your last issue was
presumably written by some clever
student (or perhaps some instructor
with a sense of humor?) in order to
get a rise out of the faculty and a
laugh out of the students. By not j
touching the actual situation at any 1
point, and even going so far as to
gibe at research, the writer must
have thought that even the profes- !
sors themselves would see the point
of his little joke.
But the is that there are
some students, even at Stanford, who
might take this "Campus to Cam
pus" communication seriously. There i i
are not only some professors who 1
seem to lack a sense of humor, but
there are also some students who
are rather low in that commodity.
The humorless professor wouldn't
be "sore" when he read the article;
he would merely say, "Well, he ob
viously doesn't mean me!" But the i
humorless student, not having ;> !
knowledge of the facts to guard
him, might be led to nourish a dull
resentment against the men with i
whom he is not getting along any too
well. We sometimes see one of these
fellows having a poor time of it in I
class, and it is hard to do anything
for him.
I don't think the writer of the
article should have used the infiu- j
ence of The Daily to increase the I
handicap of these students. For the !
benefit of these students I think it
only fair to say that the writer of
the article was not only "talking
through his hat" but that he knew j
he was, and didn't mean for you to
take it seriously.
