## Farm Squad Awaits Coming I.C.4-A., N.C.A.A. Tilts 
### Warren Breed 
Their dual meet season over, Stan
ford tracksters face now a series of
multiple-team meets, climaxing with
the 1.C.4-A. arid N.C.A.A.
I"irst come the Fresno Relays, to
be run off Friday and Saturday
nights in the valley city. The week
following is the California Intercol
legiati-s, and then the 1.C.4-A. at
.Boston.
Full Squad
Dink Templeton intimated yester
day that he will take a rather full
team to the relays â€” .somewhere
around two dozen men. Although he
said nothing of winning in the fu
ture, he wants to take advantage
ol these weeks of warm weather to
see what his men can really do, ynd
incidentally knock off a few points
here and there.
No plans for the Fresno personnel
are definite as yet, but the proba
bility is that Stanford will be repre
sented by three relay teams and a
scattering of men in the various field
events.
Johnny Mottram and Dud Sales in
the javelin, Phil Levy, Jim Reynolds,
Jack King, and A1 Hershey in the
weights, George Tliarp and Ray Dean
in the broad jump, and Hum Smith
and Millard Browne in the high
jump, are in line to make the trip.
Sammy Klopslock and Hunt Kings
bury will do the hurdling.
Plenty of Relay Men
In the way of four-man relays,
Dink wants to send a good-sized
bunch. He will enter his mile team
of Blackman, Greene, Cranston, and
Del linger.
Then there is a possibility of send
ing a sprint relay. In this, where
there will be plenty of stiff competi
tion, potential entries are Dean,
Chuck Voigt, Monk Moscrip, any of
the 440 men, or possibly Bobby
Grayson, who was quite a sprinter as
a prep and a frosty.
Third relay team to go would be
a medley distance team. In this the
runners would be Blackman, Nim
mo, March, and Dixon, running a
440. 880, 1320, and mile.
