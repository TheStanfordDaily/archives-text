## 880-MAN NIMMO WAS THE SURPRISE 
### 
Chuck Nimmo was the surprise in
store for Dean Cromwell and the
Trojans in the half-mile run Satur- |
day. The edge may have been taken I
off when Tex Bush and Bill Cart
wright passed the Stanford runner !
in the home stretch, but they had to j
break a record to do it, and Chuck's j
time of close to 1 minute 54 seconds !
is proof that his slump is over.
Chuck first surprised himself a
week ago. He had gone unplaced |
' in the P.A.A. mile, and doubled up
in the half just as a matter of
course, as he did in the Big Meet.
He was in the ruck, running about
fifth, until the last turn. Then he
found a kick which he thought he I
didn't have, and surprised himself
by passing the field and breaking
the tape in 1:58.
The next Monday he surprised |
Dink Templeton. Without opposition
he ran a 1:54.8 half mile, by far his !
best of the year. There originated
the minor conspiracy that was to
surprise the Trojans. Dink decided j
that Chuck would confine himself to
the half against S.C., and the news- j
paper men present agreed to be quiet
on 1:54.8 race. '
The ruse worked swoll until the
last 75 yards. But the advantage in
condition which all the Trojan run
ners showed proved too much for
Chuck. The Trojans were rated as a
poor traveling team, but they cer
tainly were in top shape Saturday,
everyone except Joe Gonzales, the \
two-miler, who was the ace pitcher I
on the Trojan nine until a week or |
so ago and who was in his first j
competition of the season.
The other two-milers, Lantz and i
Yates, made the eight-lap grind j
look almost enjoyable. Running ,
far *.head of the field, ihey talked |
a bit. took turns on the pole, and j
succeeded in breaking up the mo
notony of the consecutive cir
cuits. Coming off one turn Lantz. |
was heard to console himself with
a whimsical "Oh. my," which con
tained even less spleen than the j
ejaculations that follow the fa- j
miliar collar-button-rolling-undcr
the-bureau inconvenience.
