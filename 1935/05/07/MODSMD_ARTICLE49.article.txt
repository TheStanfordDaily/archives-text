# IT WAS MORE THAN A 14.4 FLIGHT
## 
### 
Sammy Klopstock's two races were j
classics for the fighting spirit that :
has always been his but which was j
never more vividly displayed than j
on Saturday.
Sam faced another tough after- j

j noon, meeting a couple of the best
j high hurdlers on the coast in the
i first race and then facing a fresh set
j of low hurdlers of the same calibre
a hylf hour later. He lacked his
I usual sparkle before the meet. He
wasn't feeling in the' best of shape
| to begin with, and an illness in the
j family had him worried.
lie took the first six hurdles in
the highs without the usual zip,
and found himself four yards be
hind the Trojans Cope and Staley.
} His heart wasn't in the race ap
parently. Then something clicked,
and S'Mnmy started flying. In three
hurdles he had drawn even with
the Trojan pair. His flying finish
nicked the tape a half a foot ahead
! of Cope. It was the greatest ex
hibition of "what it takes" that
| the current track season has yet
produced.

Water is the only breeding place
j for mosquitos.
