### 
With Spec Stewart's leaving for El
Paso to defend his Southwestern
Amateur golf championship this
week, another obstacle was removed
from Jack Hoerner's chances to re
peat his victory in the all-University
championship. The qualifying round
of that tournament is being played
this week at the same time as the
qualifying for the novice tourna
ment is progressing. All scores must
be in by Saturday.
Hoerner is very apt to have trou
ble, as there are plenty of top play
ers leit on the Farm who can make
the going tough for him. The out
standing single threat to his retain
ing the championship is Tom Dwyer,
number one man on the ladder and
only Block "S" player on the golf
team. Dwyer holds the course rec
ord and seems sure to breeze through
to the finals.
Don Edwards is another who
thould be able to make Jack lose
tome of that sleep that Spec left
consistent golfers on the Coast. He
is beaten fairly often, but it takes a
flash of brilliance to subdue his
steady, consistent shooting.
Among the men not on the varsity,
Bill Dwyer, recent winner of the
first flight in the Northern Califor
nia Championship should show up
well. Ed Beuter is another who
might make plenty of trouble for
the undergraduates if he can take
time oft to play.
All play in qualifying mast be in
threesomes or foursomes, as scores
handed in by twosomes will not be
honored. In the all-University event
two rounds must be played; in the
novice, only one is necessary. Six
teen men qualify to play each of the
two tournaments.
