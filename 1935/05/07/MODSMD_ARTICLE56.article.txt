# Decision Terms Railway Pension Measure Invalid
## Supreme Court Judgment May Invalidate NRA Legislation 
### 
WASHINGTON, May G (/P).—The
Supreme Court tagged the Railway
Pension Act "unconstitutional" to
day in a decision which left Con
gressional leaders puzziing over the
validity of the administration's pro- J
posed social security legislation and
NRA.
Kail Stocks Itisc
The verdict whirled rail stocks ;
into a short-lived upward spurt, !
sent interested senators to their!
desks to study the security and NRA J
bills in the light of the court's pro
nouncement, and brought from rail
labor leaders a statement that an- !
other retirement measure would be i
introduced soon.
Terming the benefits of the act j
"legislative largess," the majority of j
the court — Justices Roberts, Mc-
Reynolds, Sutherland, Butler, and ,
Van Devanter —found the law in- !
valid for two principal reasons:
Constitution Cited
It. held that its provisions requir- ;
ii'g railroads to contribute to a pool j
from which retirement benefits i
would be paid deprived the carriers j
of property without "the due process ]
of law" guaranteed by the Constitu
tion.
It ruled, too, that the 'social" pur- |
poses of the bill, however laudable,
were unrelated to efficiency and
safety of operation and for this, and j
other reasons, were not sustained by I
the clause of the Constitution giving j
Congress power over interstate I
commerce.
