# TRAVELS OF A STANFORD ROUGH

### CRANT LEIBERT 
As I was finishing supper one
night Antoinette and her mother
came into the hotel and sat down
with the proprietress and me. The I
two matrons were at once engrossed !
in rapid, serious conversation. An- |
toinette and I were less serious and !
very much slower in our tete-a-tete |
At the end of half an hc-ur they left
us, and I asked the senora what she
had been talking about and why she
was now smiling. r
'"Ah," she replied, "Antoinette's
mother has concluded that you shall
make a fine husband for her daugh
ter. And I think so too."
"Jose, my bags! a taxi! to the sta
tion!"
