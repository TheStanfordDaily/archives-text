There are two types of trains in
Mexico: straight and mixed. The
straight kind is like the regular
American train, but with the cool
ing system, springs, drinking water,
and dining car out of working order,
or, at the best, about 3 per cent effi
cient. This is all done purposely to
make the trip more "romantic" and
"quaint." However, if the traveler
wants the grandest thrill of all, he
should ride on the mixed trains,
which are the straight trains plus a
dozen or so of freight cars. The or
thodox time for the arrival and de
parture of Mexican trains is from
2 to 4 a.m. This, you know, is abso
lutely the most romantic time imag
inable. The moon is full, the stars
out — you'll hardly believe it — but
these little brown brothers of ours
are such a thorough people that they
very often stop their trains out in
the middle of the desert so the pas
sengers can listen to the wonderful,
romantic love-calling of the cattle in
the box cars ahead. Now, where in
the States will you find that con
sideration?
At every station the train is sur
rounded by vendors selling oranges,
soft-boiled eggs, assorted breads,
tamales, soda pop, coffee, and innu
merable Mexican dishes. The pas
sengers buy liberally at each stop,
and add their late purchases to a
large basket from which they have
| been munching continuously since
i the journey began. How they do it,
j I can't figure out. Maybe they fast
: a couple of weeks before each trip.
And always on the trains there are
| the soldiers, half a dozen or more of
J them, needing only a gun and a patch
I of the official khaki on their
I breeches to call themselves warriors,
j In answer to my inquiries of the
reason for their accompaniment, I

have been told that they arc being
officially moved, that they just like
to ride on trains, and that they are
guarding the train. The last reason
sounds the most logical until after
you see the "guards." Then you will
probably feel as I do about it—the
more distance I put between the sol
diers and myself the better my
chances for a long and happy life.
A German jewelry drummer sat
down beside me and 10 minutes later
was telling me his life story. He ran
away from home, joined the German
navy, submarine corps, and served
through the war. When he returned,
misery, poverty, hunger and wretch
edness greeted him, so he came to
America to see a brother in Chicago.
But in the land of Freedom and
Democracy the anti-German feeling
was still aflame, so the ex-sailor bor
rowed a few dollars from his brother
and struck out for Mexico.
Here he found Liberty not talked
about but enjoyed. A countryman
gave him a start in the jewelry busi
ness and he did very well. His
landlord's daughter soon caught his
eye, but even knowing that she
liked hiin, he could not summon up
enough courage nor Spanish to ask
for her hand. Luckily, the father
was not as blind as he pretended to
be, for one evening he came in to
see the German and did not leave
until the wedding had been ar
ranged. Now they have three lusty
sons, and he taught his wife to make
good German sausage, which finds a
leady market in the extensive col
ony of his countrymen.
He told me stories of the revolu
tions, of politics, and at last he
reached for the large leather box of
treasures. Tray after tray of glitter
ing rings, bracelets, amulets, ear
rings, watch chains and stickpins
were pulled out, exhibited and, in
an amazed tone, priced for my ear
j alone. And, of course, I succumbed.

A German jewelry drummer sat
down beside me and 10 minutes later
was telling me his life story. He ran
away from home, joined the German
navy, submarine corps, and served
through the war. When he returned,
misery, poverty, hunger and wretch
edness greeted him, so he came to
America to see a brother in Chicago.
But in the land of Freedom and
Democracy the anti-German feeling
was still aflame, so the ex-sailor bor
rowed a few dollars from his brother
and struck out for Mexico.
Here he found Liberty not talked
about but enjoyed. A countryman
gave him a start in the jewelry busi
ness and he did very well. His
landlord's daughter soon caught his
eye, but even knowing that she
liked hiin, he could not summon up
enough courage nor Spanish to ask
for her hand. Luckily, the father
was not as blind as he pretended to
be, for one evening he came in to
see the German and did not leave
until the wedding had been ar
ranged. Now they have three lusty
sons, and he taught his wife to make
good German sausage, which finds a
leady market in the extensive col
ony of his countrymen.
He told me stories of the revolu
tions, of politics, and at last he
reached for the large leather box of
treasures. Tray after tray of glitter
ing rings, bracelets, amulets, ear
rings, watch chains and stickpins
were pulled out, exhibited and, in
an amazed tone, priced for my ear
j alone. And, of course, I succumbed.
There are two types of trains in
Mexico: straight and mixed. The
straight kind is like the regular
American train, but with the cool
ing system, springs, drinking water,
and dining car out of working order,
or, at the best, about 3 per cent effi
cient. This is all done purposely to
make the trip more "romantic" and
"quaint." However, if the traveler
wants the grandest thrill of all, he
should ride on the mixed trains,
which are the straight trains plus a
dozen or so of freight cars. The or
thodox time for the arrival and de
parture of Mexican trains is from
2 to 4 a.m. This, you know, is abso
lutely the most romantic time imag
inable. The moon is full, the stars
out — you'll hardly believe it — but
these little brown brothers of ours
are such a thorough people that they
very often stop their trains out in
the middle of the desert so the pas
sengers can listen to the wonderful,
romantic love-calling of the cattle in
the box cars ahead. Now, where in
the States will you find that con
sideration?
At every station the train is sur
rounded by vendors selling oranges,
soft-boiled eggs, assorted breads,
tamales, soda pop, coffee, and innu
merable Mexican dishes. The pas
sengers buy liberally at each stop,
and add their late purchases to a
large basket from which they have

i the journey began. How they do it,
