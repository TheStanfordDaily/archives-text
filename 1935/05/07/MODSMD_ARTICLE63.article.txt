# CHEMISTS TO DESERT CLASSES FOR PICNIC
## 
### 
Tomorrow will be an unusual day
for the chemists, when they will de
sert their labs and travel to Sears
ville Lake for the annual chemistry
picnic, and to take part in a large
program of activities and entertain
ment.
Competition will be keen when the
organic and physical chemists op
pose each other in a baseball game,
and then when members of Alpha
Chi Sigma and Phi Lambda Upsilon
demonstrate their ability in a swim
ming meet. Many others plan to
amuse themselves at horseshoes.
After the supper which is planned,
the official sodium-thrower will add
the final touch to the celebration by
tossing a large quantity of the in
flammable metal into the lake, with
accompanying fireworks and explo
sions.
