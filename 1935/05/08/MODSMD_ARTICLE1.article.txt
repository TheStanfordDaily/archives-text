## President Will Respond To Queries from Various Campus Officials MEET SET TOMORROW Assembly Open for A.S.S.U Members, Faculty 
### Herb Diamond 
Cross - examination proceedings
will be in order tomorrow evening at
the conclusion of Dr. Ray Lyman
Wilbur's dissection of student gov
ernment which he will perform at a
semi-panel discussion in the Little
Theater at 7:30 o'clock.
For, waiting with a specially
prepared barrage of queries per
tinent to the general topic, will
he Dr. Harold C. Hand, Miss
Louise Price, Dean Mary Yost,
Debater Dave Mcllinkoff, Ken
neth Livingston, and A.S.S.U.
President Marvie Kahn.
It is with their help that Dr. Wil
bur will search out and weigh many
of the problems that student govern
ment administration is currently
confronted with and then proceed to
criticize constructively. By means of
such organized questioning it is ex
pected that many vital issues will be
considered and many present loop
holes in the system of student con
trol will be plugged up.
Discusses Many Phases
Relations, added functions, pro
gressive innovations, and proposals
for change in student government
are but a few of the varied phases
on the program. The meeting, said
to be a direct outgrowth of the first
Pi Lambda Theta panel forum on
student government, will be thrown
open to all students and faculty
members.
However, due to the limited seat
ing capacity in the Little Theater
and the comparatively large au
dience expected, Kahn urges the
early arrival of everyone who hopes
to witness the proceedings.
To Aid Future Uulc
The entire discussion, in his
opinion, will prove of vital import
ance to the student body. Much
bearing upon the future status of
student government at Stanford, he
promises, will be brought to light.
Campus governing bodies, the stu
dent president adds, must con
stantly be alive to and able to cope
with ever-increasing problems which
accompany added functions of gov
ernment. Of necessity these will be
considered. Comment and further
questioning-will be invited from the
audience as the discussion contin
ues.
The objective will be the gaining,
by means of a somewhat informal
exchange of ideas, as wide a per
spective of student government and
its problems as possible. Subsequent
sessions, similar to tomorrow night's
proceedings, may follow within a
short time.
