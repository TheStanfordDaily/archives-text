# Guggenheim Wind Tube Useful in Aviation Study
## 
### ROGER KIMBALL 
Little known, but an important
part of the University, is Stanford's
wind tunnel, located in the Gug
genheim Aeronautic Laboratory near
the clock tower. This tunnel, the
third to be constructed by the en
gineering department, is useful , in
the study of air conditions encoun
tere'd by aviators.
The first wind tube was built in
the fall and winter of 1916-17.
Knowledge of air propellers was
limited then, and an extended inves
tigation of them with adequate
equipment was the immediate pur
pose of the division of aeronautical
engineering in founding the labora
tory.
5195.000 Invested
With a honeycomb structure built
in the delivery end to secure uni
form air velocity, the original tun
nel was only a temporary affair.
In 1923 the University granted
$25,000 for the construction of a
larger and more permanent tube.
This new tunnel was located at the
site now used for parking on the

north side of the Union. The pres
ent concrete parking space was orig
inally the floor of the second wind
tunnel building.
Four years later the University
was given $195,000 by the Gufigen
heim Fund for the Promotion of
Aeronautics. This grant made pos
sible ihe establishment of the lab
oratory. A third wind tunnel was
built, with a throat diameler of 8
feet and a length of G8 feet.
Apparatus Elaborate
This new structure has an eiglit
bladed fan, which is driven by a
motor permitting a wind speed of 90
miles per hour. There is also a
propeller-testing apparatus, and both
this and the main driving motor are
supplied with power by a motor
generator set.
According to Professor Everett P.
Lesley of the mechanical engineer
ing department, 30 men have re
ceived degrees in aeronautic engi
neering since the laboratory was
founded in 1927. All but three of
those 30 are now employed in the
aeronautical industry.
