# DOUBLE STAGE IS FEATURE OF 'YELLOW JACK'
## Andreini Heads Erection Of Technical Devices For Complicated Sets 
### 
A stage with two levels—a revolv
ing circle—double proscenium—two
light bridges — and scenes which
change without closing the curtain—
all these are featured in Friday eve
ning's performance of "Yellow Jack."
Tickets are now on sale for 25, 50,
and 75 cents.
Under the technical direction of
George Andreini, one of the most
effective sets in recent years is be
ing constructed hit by hit on the
Assembly Hall stage. "The play
would he interesting from the
technical angle alone," comments
Andreini. "There are more me
chanical devices in the current
play than all the others com
bined."
The stage is divided into two main
levels. In the center of the upper is
a revolving stage, supported by a
single Ford wheel.
Two Stages Built
A double proscenium has been
constructed to make the second
stage complete in itself. A separate
light bridge has been added, so that
the upper level is completely
equipped.
The play required.two or three
scenes with desks and chairs. No
space was available; so Andreini has
incorporated into the scenery a unit
which, when pulled out, form desks,
and when folded in is an integral
part of the set.
Rattan Background
Behind the revolving circle is a
rattan background. For oil scenes in
Reed's laboratory the rattan turns
to the rear of the circle. It otherwise
conceals the revolving portion and
serves as a background for the front
stage.
Separate tents, cots, and an entire
house will be moved in under con
cealment of darkness as action pro
ceeds on another part of the stage.
Several unusual properties were
listed, and gave Andreini and his
assistants days of trouble. Among
them were hypodermic needles,
syringes, and microscopes, which
were found in the chemistry and
biology departments.
A dog takes an important part in
the play, and was quickly discov
ered. What puzzled the property
crew was a monkey's liver. They
finally soaked a sponge in red ink
and solved the difficulty.
