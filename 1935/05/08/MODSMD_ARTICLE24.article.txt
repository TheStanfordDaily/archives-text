# Propose New Joint Drama Council Plan
## Ex Committee Moves To Solve Problem 
### 
Out of the chaotic conditions sur
rounding the fate of Stanford's Dra
matic Council has come the pro
posal of a plan to solve all difficul
ties—a "bicameral" Drama Council.
The plan was proposed by a com
mittee composed of President Marvie
Kahn, Frank Fullenwider, A1 Black
mail, Bill Stark, and Henry Brill.
Dramatic Council's suggestion that
dramatics should in the future be
handled by the University was sub
mitted by Ex Committee to Presi
dent Wilbur last week. This morn
ing Dr. Wilbur, accepting the recom
mendation, said: "The University
will endeavor to put the whole ques
tion ot dramatics on an academic
and professional basis, retaining, as
much a.s possible, student participa
tion."
Plan Goes to Wilbur
The student committee's plan has
been designed to meet the state
ment of principle made by Dr. Wil
bur and will now be submitted to
him.
The proposal, briefly, is this:
'I he present Dramatic Council set
up will be retained until the open
ing of the new Memorial Theater,
which will probably be next Feb
ruary. After that, the council will
be reorganized with both student
and faculty members, in a ratio
not yet determined.
Under the new council, two types
of productions will be presented.
The School of the Theater, which the
University will establish, will pre
sent serious and artistic productions.
These will be chosen and produced
by the faculty members of the coun
cil. with the student members act
ing in an advisory capacity. All
financial obligations will be assumed
by the University.
Students Give Plays
Productions of the lighter type,
such as the Gaieties, will be given
under the direction of the student
dramatic council, with student di
rection and student financial respon
sibility. The faculty members of the
council will in such instances act in
a purely advisory way.
Under this plan, the students will
no longer have to pay part of the
faculty director's salary. The dra
matics manager will continue to re
ceive a salary from the A.S.S.U., as
at present.
