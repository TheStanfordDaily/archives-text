"It stinks of politics," said A.S.S.U.
' President Marvie Kahn as he showed
to Ex Committee last night a peti
tion of 170 signatures asking that a
special election be held on the prop
; osition that graduates be disquali-
I tied from holding the offices of
A.S.S.U. president and women's
vice-president; but Ex Committee
i voted to submit the matter to a stu
dent vote on next Tuesday.
Kahn was inferring that because
the petition was sent in at this
time, it obviously referred to the
growing political nianeuverings
centering around the coming
A.S.S.U. election to be held on
May 21.
Under the constitution, Ex Com
mittee is allowed to delay 15 days
before presenting petitioned propo
sitions to student vote. Kahn was
counselling a delay until after the
current election to divorce the mat
ter from politics, but Ex Committee
; members contended that the intent
of the petitioners was to have the
vote apply to the present election,
and that their will should be carried
I out. '
Up to Students
They stated that it was up to the
opponents of the measure to defeat it
at the polls, and that student opin
ion should be expressed in that mat
ter, rather than to let the stigma for
i negating student opinion rest on Ex
i Committee.
Nothing was decided about the
Masque Ball King and Queen Con
tost, despite the fact that Marion
Storey, Women's Conference presi
dent, and Will Eisner, of the Con
valescent Home Drive committee, in
dulged in a lively repartee over Muss
S Storey's contentions that the contest
had a bad effect on Stanford co-eds
as a whole, and that it increased
Hall-Row rivalry.
Vote Deadlocked
The net result was that a motion
to appoint a committee to present,
alternatives for the contest resulted
I in a tie when Kahn threw in his vote
to make it 5 to 5. Possibility that
I the matter will be brought up again
next week, when Bill Rogers, ab-
I sent last night, can be at. the meet
; ing was advanced.
The binder-dividers squabble
was finally decided upon, with the
plan drawn up by the committee
of Kahn, Student Manager Ben
Cave, and Publications Council
President Gordon Steedman in
conjunction with Graduate Man
ager A1 Masters.
The new scheme, which was ap
proved last night, would give the ac
tivity to two applicants who would
be guaranteed $100 apiece. Appli-
I cants would submit their names to
Publications Council, who in turn
I would pass on the names of three
; tentative nominees to Masters, who
i would decide.
Division of the spoils over the
guarantees would result: f>o per cent
io Publications Council, a maximum
'of 40 per cent to the appointees, 10
per cent to the A.S.S.U.

The binder-dividers squabble
was finally decided upon, with the
plan drawn up by the committee
of Kahn, Student Manager Ben
Cave, and Publications Council
President Gordon Steedman in
conjunction with Graduate Man
ager A1 Masters.
The new scheme, which was ap
proved last night, would give the ac
tivity to two applicants who would
be guaranteed $100 apiece. Appli-
I cants would submit their names to
Publications Council, who in turn
I would pass on the names of three
; tentative nominees to Masters, who
i would decide.
Division of the spoils over the
guarantees would result: f>o per cent
io Publications Council, a maximum
'of 40 per cent to the appointees, 10
per cent to the A.S.S.U.
"It stinks of politics," said A.S.S.U.
' President Marvie Kahn as he showed
to Ex Committee last night a peti
tion of 170 signatures asking that a
special election be held on the prop
; osition that graduates be disquali-
I tied from holding the offices of
A.S.S.U. president and women's
vice-president; but Ex Committee
i voted to submit the matter to a stu
dent vote on next Tuesday.
Kahn was inferring that because
the petition was sent in at this
time, it obviously referred to the
growing political nianeuverings
centering around the coming
A.S.S.U. election to be held on
May 21.
Under the constitution, Ex Com
mittee is allowed to delay 15 days
before presenting petitioned propo
sitions to student vote. Kahn was
counselling a delay until after the
current election to divorce the mat
ter from politics, but Ex Committee
; members contended that the intent
of the petitioners was to have the
vote apply to the present election,
and that their will should be carried
I out. '
Up to Students
They stated that it was up to the
opponents of the measure to defeat it
at the polls, and that student opin
ion should be expressed in that mat
ter, rather than to let the stigma for
i negating student opinion rest on Ex
i Committee.
Nothing was decided about the
Masque Ball King and Queen Con
tost, despite the fact that Marion
Storey, Women's Conference presi
dent, and Will Eisner, of the Con
valescent Home Drive committee, in
dulged in a lively repartee over Muss
S Storey's contentions that the contest
had a bad effect on Stanford co-eds
as a whole, and that it increased
Hall-Row rivalry.
Vote Deadlocked
The net result was that a motion
to appoint a committee to present,
alternatives for the contest resulted
I in a tie when Kahn threw in his vote
to make it 5 to 5. Possibility that
I the matter will be brought up again
next week, when Bill Rogers, ab-
I sent last night, can be at. the meet
