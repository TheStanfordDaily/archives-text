# Bonus Measure Calls for Large Currency Issue
## $2,200,000,000 Provided To Guarantee Veterans Relief Payment Vinson Bill Is Abandoned; Patman Plan Passed 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 7 (#>).—'The
Patman bill voted by the Senate to
day has been called the "inflation
ary" and "greenback" bonus bill. It
provides a $2,200,000,000 issue of new
currency to pay the bonus.
The Vinson measure, which wa£
sidetracked, would have paid oft the
bonus in cash, but would also have
left to the Administration determi
nation-of how to raise the money.
Interest Taken
The Patman bill would pay to the
average veteran the full face value
of his adjusted service certificate,
minus any loans and interest due
against it. For the 15 per cent of
the veterans who have not borrowed,
this would average $1000. For the 85
per cent who have, it would average
$497.
The bill would authorize the Sec
retary of the Treasury to suf
ficient non-interest bearing notes to
pay of! the certificates. This has been
estimated at $2,201,934,000. But if
the price level reached the 1921 -
1929 average, lhe Treasury would
be authorized to contract the cur
rency.
Eligible veterans who had not ap
plied for their bonus certificates
would have until January 2, 1940, to
do so. Altogether, approximately
3,500,000 veterans now hold certifi
cates.
Longer To Pay
Senator Thomas of Oklahoma, in
flation leader of the Senate, said on
the Senate floor today both bills
were identical in calling for full
cash payment of the bonus, but the
Vinson bill would take longer to
administer and payments would be
delayed.
The Patman bill, Thomas said,
would refund all interest paid on
loans since 1931, but the Vinson bill
would repeal all interest ever bor
rowed on bonus loans.
Payment Delayed
That, he said, would r - equire long
computations and delay payment of
the bonus for several months.
Senator McAdoo of California,
former Secretary of the Treasury, in
advocating payment of the bonus
under the Patman plan, stressed an
other difference between that bill
and the Vinson measure. He said
the Vinson bill would call for a bond
issue that would require $66,000,000
of interest annually.

the veterans who have not borrowed,
this would average $1000. For the 85
per cent who have, it would average
$497.
The bill would authorize the Sec
retary of the Treasury to suf
ficient non-interest bearing notes to
pay of! the certificates. This has been
estimated at $2,201,934,000. But if
the price level reached the 1921 -
1929 average, lhe Treasury would
be authorized to contract the cur
rency.
Eligible veterans who had not ap
plied for their bonus certificates
would have until January 2, 1940, to
do so. Altogether, approximately
3,500,000 veterans now hold certifi
cates.
Longer To Pay
Senator Thomas of Oklahoma, in
flation leader of the Senate, said on
the Senate floor today both bills
were identical in calling for full
cash payment of the bonus, but the
Vinson bill would take longer to
administer and payments would be
delayed.
The Patman bill, Thomas said,
would refund all interest paid on
loans since 1931, but the Vinson bill
would repeal all interest ever bor
rowed on bonus loans.
Payment Delayed
That, he said, would r - equire long
computations and delay payment of
the bonus for several months.
Senator McAdoo of California,
former Secretary of the Treasury, in
advocating payment of the bonus
under the Patman plan, stressed an
other difference between that bill
and the Vinson measure. He said
the Vinson bill would call for a bond
issue that would require $66,000,000
of interest annually.
WASHINGTON, May 7 (#>).—'The
Patman bill voted by the Senate to
day has been called the "inflation
ary" and "greenback" bonus bill. It
provides a $2,200,000,000 issue of new
currency to pay the bonus.
The Vinson measure, which wa£
sidetracked, would have paid oft the
bonus in cash, but would also have
left to the Administration determi
nation-of how to raise the money.
Interest Taken
The Patman bill would pay to the
average veteran the full face value
of his adjusted service certificate,
minus any loans and interest due
against it. For the 15 per cent of
the veterans who have not borrowed,
this would average $1000. For the 85
per cent who have, it would average
$497.
