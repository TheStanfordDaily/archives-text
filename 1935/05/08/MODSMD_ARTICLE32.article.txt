						Special Election And a New Mess of Politics
## 
### 
The annual political war is on. II began
last nielli in Ihe Ex Committee rooms with
:i petition presented ;m<l accepted, to hold
a special election next Tuesday.
The question before the student body con
cerns the eligibility of graduate students on
Ihe campus holding the offices ol president
or vice-president of the Associated Students.
The amendment proposed would allow only
undergraduates to hold either ot these two
offices.
This question is nothing new to Stanford.
II comes up every year, and has appeared spo
radically iti the Campus Opinion column ol
the StantoiU) Daily for the past few weeks.
What is significant is that this petition is
hul the beginning of a political feud that will
rock the campus for the next two weeks until
the A.S.S.U. elections are held. It is no credit
whatsoever to Stanford student government
to boast of three elections in one single quar
ter of school. The one on May 21 must neces
sarily be held; the other two special elections,
first the one in which the plurality amend
ment was defeated, and now Ibis special elec
tion on the graduate versus undergraduate
question, have been sponsored by definite
minority political groups and smell very sus
piciously, of fishniarket politics.
What the actual maneuvering behind this
latest brainstorm signed by one hundred and
seventy-three people collected from three or
four factions may he, will be revealed later.
Meanwhile, any expressions of opinion by
undergraduate and graduate on the proposed
amendment will be welcomed by the Daily,
provided tbev remain withn the two-hundred
word limit.
