# Finally â€” A School of the Theater
## 
### 
A permanent School of the Theater, satis
factory liiuuu'ial arrangements for drama,
and an excellent system ol' student and fac
ulty control are provided for in the recom
mendation made to the Administration last
night by the Executive Committee.
Last week's action, apparently only a ges
ture, brought forth unexpected results when
the administration indicated hearty co-opera
tion with student opinion on the dramatic
school plan; and student initiative in turning
control over to the factulty is just what was
needed to correct an unwieldy arrangement.
It was apparent at first that students would
never wish to relinquish control completely;
and it was also apparent that the present sys
tem could not be continued.
Compromise was essential; and the plan
which was worked out yesterday seems to
lilt the bill. Cultural, class, and workshop
plays, designed for the group interested in
serious dramatics, will be where they belong,
under skilled direction. Performances of the
lighter type, musical shows, the Gaieties, light
operas, and one-act tournaments, can be held
easily under student direction and manage
ment.
What is needed now is acceptance by the
t'niversity of the Ex Committee's recommen
dation; and then in February the new, sen
sible plan can be put into effect, christening
Stanford's new Theater with a series of well
directed. popular, and financially successful
productions.
