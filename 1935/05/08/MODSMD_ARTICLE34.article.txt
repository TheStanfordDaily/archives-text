## 
### 
Student government in universities, Stan
lord in particular, will favor the critical con
sideration of campus leaders tomorrow night
in a semi-panel discussion in the Little The
ater. The ramifications of student adminis
tration, gradually being incorporated because
of the increasing number of student functions,
will be analyzed for a possible solution toward
the maintenance of efficiency in the added
structure of government.
An outgrowth of the symposium of two
weeks ago which was sponsored by the local
women's honorary educational to
morrow's discussion is a move toward a more
general interest and a more intelligent leader
ship in student government and politics. It is
a step toward a better understanding between
students and faculty of their respective places
in the college administrative set-up.
A regular and well planned schedule of like
symposiums during the I'niversity year would
undoubtedly lead to a student government on
Ihe Farm which could be mentioned casually
without an accompanying smile of cynicism.
