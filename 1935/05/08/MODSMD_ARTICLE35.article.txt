# Atherton Also Wants a "Dry Zone"
## 
### 
Atherton's town council has decided to re
quest the notoriously uninformed and bun
dling Hoard of Equalization to create a half
mile "dry /one" around Mcnlo School and
Junior (College.
The move followed recent disclosures by
Lowrv S. Howard, president of the college, of
the existence of live liquor places either open
for business, or in preparation for opening,
directly opposite the school. The state board,
however, still unmindful of existing condi
tions, had previously retorted that the liquor
sales, being made to minors in that area, were
news to that body.
II the board should create the requested
"dry zone," the present restricted zone around
Stanford would be extended through Mcnlo
Park to the Alherlon town limits.
