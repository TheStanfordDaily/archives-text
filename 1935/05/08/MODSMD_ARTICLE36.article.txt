# WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE NEW DEAL?

WHO'S AFRAID OF THE BIG BAD BLUE BUZZARD?
WASHINGTON, D.C., May 5.—A lot of water has
passed under the bridge in the two years the NRA has
been with us. Unless Congress revives it, it will die
a natural death on June 16. In Washington the bird
doctors are trying to decide whether the sickly Blue
Eagle should be given another lease on lite. The
President and his right-hand yes-man, Donald Rich
berg, want two years more added to its existence.
Senator Borah wants its neck wrung right now. By a
Senate committee vote of 16-4 it will be given a sug
gested 10 months to show what it can do. If it fails,
into the soup it will go.
But is the NRA worth continuing? Isn't it just
another "noble experiment" like Prohibition? Before
we can say for sure, let's see what the NRA tried to do
and what if. did.
WHAT NRA TRIED TO DO
The idea behind the Blue Eagle was to prevent fu
ture depressions by balancing productive capacity and
mass buying power. The method of doing this was to
bring capital (employers) and organized labor (unions)
together in a partnership under government sponsor
ship. The consumers were supposed to sit around and
"advise." At any rate this partnership was the NRA.
After these "partners" got together and discussed
the situation in' each industry (all 7,500 of them) a
code of fair competition for the industry was adopted.
It usually limited working hours, fixed minimum wages,
and outlawed unfair trade practices such as price
cutting. After F.R. had approved the code an admin
istrator was appointed and a code authority, sup
ported by assessments on each company, was set up
to administer the code. Then after months of propa
ganda and swearing by General Johnson his Blue
Eagle took oft.
WHAT IT DID
The only way to test the NRA to find out what it
has really done is by trying to answer two questions:
(1) Has mass buying power been increased? (2) Has
overproduction been stopped? It is true that buying
power increased for a while, but only by employing
more people at smaller wages per man. This hap
pened because hourly wages went up a little, but to
employ more, everybody had to work shorter hours, so
earned less per week.
By raising hourly wages NRA soon squeezed out
the weak companies; by outlawing price-cutting it
made bigger profits. Naturally some industries were
pleased. But here is where ihe trouble began.
Sooner or later higher wages will mean higher
prices. As we saw, wages per man went up very
little; lately they have gone down. But at the same
time the cost of living went up and up, so that the
worker is really no better off than before. The white
collar worker was worse off as his salary stayed the
same while prices skyrocketed.
The natural outcome of no price-cutting is price
fixing by the industries and code authorities. This
means higher prices to the consumer, who will get it
in the neck. That is exactly what happened. Consum
ers had less income than before, prices were higher, so
they bought less, and industry was caught in the
vicious circle of the Blue Eagle's flight. Relief rolls rose
alarmingly—especially in industrial centers.
STRIKE TROUBLE
Section 7a of the NIRA gave labor the right to
organize for collective bargaining with employers. The
section was so indefinite that labor unions thought it
gave them a free hand and a monopoly on employee
organization. Employers thought it required company
unions. After the A. F. of L. got a million new mem
bers on the strength of 7a, the President admitted he
didn't know what it meant. The courts have been
trying to find out ever since. It's safe to say nobody
gained anything through the many strikes caused by
the NRA. Plenty was lost, though.
Tomorrow: Vested Interests in NRA.

code of fair competition for the industry was adopted.
It usually limited working hours, fixed minimum wages,
and outlawed unfair trade practices such as price
cutting. After F.R. had approved the code an admin
istrator was appointed and a code authority, sup
ported by assessments on each company, was set up
to administer the code. Then after months of propa
ganda and swearing by General Johnson his Blue
Eagle took oft.
WHAT IT DID
The only way to test the NRA to find out what it
has really done is by trying to answer two questions:
(1) Has mass buying power been increased? (2) Has
overproduction been stopped? It is true that buying
power increased for a while, but only by employing
more people at smaller wages per man. This hap
pened because hourly wages went up a little, but to
employ more, everybody had to work shorter hours, so
earned less per week.
By raising hourly wages NRA soon squeezed out
the weak companies; by outlawing price-cutting it
made bigger profits. Naturally some industries were
pleased. But here is where ihe trouble began.
Sooner or later higher wages will mean higher
prices. As we saw, wages per man went up very
little; lately they have gone down. But at the same
time the cost of living went up and up, so that the
worker is really no better off than before. The white
collar worker was worse off as his salary stayed the
same while prices skyrocketed.
The natural outcome of no price-cutting is price
fixing by the industries and code authorities. This
means higher prices to the consumer, who will get it
in the neck. That is exactly what happened. Consum
ers had less income than before, prices were higher, so
they bought less, and industry was caught in the
vicious circle of the Blue Eagle's flight. Relief rolls rose
alarmingly—especially in industrial centers.
STRIKE TROUBLE
Section 7a of the NIRA gave labor the right to
organize for collective bargaining with employers. The
section was so indefinite that labor unions thought it
gave them a free hand and a monopoly on employee
organization. Employers thought it required company
unions. After the A. F. of L. got a million new mem
bers on the strength of 7a, the President admitted he
didn't know what it meant. The courts have been
trying to find out ever since. It's safe to say nobody
gained anything through the many strikes caused by
the NRA. Plenty was lost, though.
Tomorrow: Vested Interests in NRA.
WHO'S AFRAID OF THE BIG BAD BLUE BUZZARD?
WASHINGTON, D.C., May 5.—A lot of water has
passed under the bridge in the two years the NRA has
been with us. Unless Congress revives it, it will die
a natural death on June 16. In Washington the bird
doctors are trying to decide whether the sickly Blue
Eagle should be given another lease on lite. The
President and his right-hand yes-man, Donald Rich
berg, want two years more added to its existence.
Senator Borah wants its neck wrung right now. By a
Senate committee vote of 16-4 it will be given a sug
gested 10 months to show what it can do. If it fails,
into the soup it will go.
But is the NRA worth continuing? Isn't it just
another "noble experiment" like Prohibition? Before
we can say for sure, let's see what the NRA tried to do
and what if. did.
WHAT NRA TRIED TO DO
The idea behind the Blue Eagle was to prevent fu
ture depressions by balancing productive capacity and
mass buying power. The method of doing this was to
bring capital (employers) and organized labor (unions)
together in a partnership under government sponsor
ship. The consumers were supposed to sit around and
"advise." At any rate this partnership was the NRA.
After these "partners" got together and discussed
the situation in' each industry (all 7,500 of them) a
code of fair competition for the industry was adopted.
It usually limited working hours, fixed minimum wages,
and outlawed unfair trade practices such as price
cutting. After F.R. had approved the code an admin
istrator was appointed and a code authority, sup
ported by assessments on each company, was set up
