There was an accountant named Smedger,
Who was an awful old ledger.
Of sin a amount
You may credit to his account,
And he made many red letters, you Ledger.
Which should be a commentary on the current lax
ity, or elasticity of morals, but not nearly as much as
the current tales about the petting that is spreading
around the campus.
Over in Lagunita there is a little girl who owns a
duck, and there was a little Kappa pledge who lived
in Lagunita who had a pet rabbit. She used to wear
a fur coat on some of the hottest days, and the only
reason that could be .seen for her action was that she
was hiding her rabbit from supervisorial eyes (due to
the no-pets rule in the dormitory) while she took the
animal out to enjoy God's great out-of-doors.
The Kappa pledge finally decided to sequester her
animal at the Kappa house, where ihe brute spent
many happy hours in a cage in the backyard. But
some fraternity man apparently came down like the
wolf on the fold and spirited the animal away, and the
rabbit has not been seen since.
Of course, everyone has heard of Jim Copp's baby
alligator that he sent to the Theta house, and which
arrived during a formal dinner.
Stanford's lucky turtle also found life in Lagunita
too wearisome, and was last heard of in the health
giving atmosphere of a P.E. faculty member's house
hold.
There was a chameleon at the Chi O house for two
days, but the little horse of a different color demanded
a diet of insects. This shocked the delicate sensibilities
of the Chi O's. so he was fnrred to pack up his trunks
and depart.
Encina dances are always hazardous enterpi ises.
because of the fact that those Encina men who are
not dancing are apt to forget to pull down their blinds
i when they undress. This unfortunate circumstance
happened to two D.U. pledges whose rooms were so
; situated on the second floor that their failure to close
I the door gave them an unrestricted view of ihe
| dancers and vice versa.
