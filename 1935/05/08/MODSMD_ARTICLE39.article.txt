ambitions and desires, relegating
everyone to eltortless and sluggish
life.

and its people—a.„ Southern "Main
Street," sketching characteristically
the variety of people who have come
with different aims and backgrounds,
but who inevitably find themselves
submitting contentedly to the lazy
end inactive existence.
