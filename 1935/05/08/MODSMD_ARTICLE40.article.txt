# BULL SESSION
## GRADUATION IN STADIUM 
### 
After four years of it, the class of
'35 is more or less ready to graduate.
i
Having passed through ihe blatant
timidity of froshdom, the corduroyed
i boldness of =ophomorehood, and tha
| sophisticated indifierence of junior
: days — the seniors are prepared to
J hide their individuality beneath cap
j and gown, and clutch for the coveted
j sheepskin.
In days past, Stanford commence-
J ment exercises have been held in
: the Chapel. And though the Chapel
!is hallowed with tradition, it was
j always reeking with perspiration at
| the end of the average graduation
j address. The Chapel is beautiful,
I and time honored, but it is small.
I And though it is perhaps elevating
J to receive one's diploma on the fern
i banked Chapel pulpit, the sight (if a
I thousand relatives craning necks
j around pillars and mopping dripping
1 brows is anything but inspirational.
|
| Now the exercises are to be moved
I into the Stadium. And strongly
| smitten with the urge-to-praise, we
| must ofier orchids to those whose
; good sense has enabled them to break
with a tradition that was becoming
increasingly impossible.
' At first glance, it does seem rather
! incongruous to hold a solemn com
| mencement on the same stamping
i grounds where have roamed in in

discriminate abandon the S.C. band,
sheep, and football behemoths. And i
there is terrific tt mptation to drama
tize the '35 exercises in the terms of
the gridiron, with John Doe dashing '
acros the 50-yard line for a diploma,
Jane Doe skirting light end for a
degree, and the Board of Trustees
going into a huddle to decide !
whether or not to pass the sheepskin
to Jane-John Doe-Doe.
But when the tumult and the boo
ing dies away, one fact stands forth:
graduation is a grandstand play for j
the benefit of fond parents and senti
mental relatives. Graduations are j
made for one's relatives. Fathers 1
and mothers, aunts and uncles—who
have had some part in seeing Johnny
through college, now turn out en
masse to see Johnny get a receipt for
a four year's investment. Gradua
tion is the family field day. And
there is no good reason why things
should not be made as comfortable
as possible for my aunt from Bisbee
and her husband, my uncle.
The exercises will be held suffi
ciently late in the afternoon to avoid
the heat of the June sun. There will i
even be room for great aunt Ma- |
tilda—who always ihought we were j
i dear. And, finally—is it not pe
culiarly appropriate that graduation j
from a modern American university !
should be held in a football arena?
