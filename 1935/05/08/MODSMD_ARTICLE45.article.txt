## 3 Relay Squads Chosen; To Leave Friday 
### Gordon Frost 
Twenty-one cindermen, best of
Stanford's varsity squad, were
picked by Coach Dink Templeton to
trek southward for the annual
Fresno Relays scheduled to be run
under the powerful arc lights of the
Raisin City Stadium Friday and Sat
urday nights.
Three four-man. relay teams were
named by Templeton. Ray Dean,
Chuck Voigt, Sammy Klopstock, and
Alex Faye will run the 440 and the
880 relays; Al Blackmail, Al Cran
ston, "Truck" Dellinger, and John
Green the mile, and Warren Dixon,
Chuck Nimmo, Rusty March, and Al
Blackmail, the medley relay.
Field Men Named
Along with the relay contestants
Dink will enter Johnny Mottram,
Bill Beatty, and Dud Sales to throw
the javelin; George Tharp to broad
jump; Millard Browne in the high
jump; Hunt Kingsbury in the hur
dles and Joe Burris as general util
ity mm. Phil Levy, Jim Reynolds,
and Al Hershey will uphold Stanford
honors in the shot put and discus.
Humbert Smith, ace high jump
er, will not he entered *\t all, says
Dink. IJo wants to let "Smitty"
rest his injured ankle this week
end with the hope that the lay
olY will put him in shape for the
Four Way meet slated for the fol
lowing week. Browne, who tied
with Smith for second in the
U.S.C. meet last Saturday is Stan
ford's only competitor for high
jump points.
The relays this year will draw one
of the most formidable array of
track and field talent assembled dur
ing the 19I!5 season. World's cham
pion high jumper Walter Marty will
match his spring against Cornelius
Johnson.
Medley Featured
The medley relay which has laps
of 440, 880, 1320 and mile looms as a
feature event. Three standout milers
will be on hand to run the final lap
of this event, Bob Fowler for Cali
lornia, Norm Bright for the Olympic
Club and Warren Dixon of Stanford.
Johnny Mottram will get a chance
to settle a little dispute between
himself and Norman Fitzgerald who
came through to beat him in the Cal
meet last month. Ed Waterbury,
Olympic Club's star javelin heaver
will also be on hand to make the
battle go three ways.
Templeton took his usual pessi
mistic stand on Stanford's chances,
when questioned yesterday. Dink
was chatting with members of the
little group of Angell Field sideline
commentators that are always on
hand to watch workouts these days.
"What are our chances, Dink?"
was the query.
"Well, we ought to take about fifth
in our division. There are five en
tries,"' was Dink's reply.
Usually over-pessimistic this year,
the Card coach's joking words can
be taken with a grain of salt. It
seems unlikely that Stanford will
take last in the college division but
a first place also is improbable.
