FRESNO'S RELAYS—
MOKE RECORD TOPPLING

Another Fresno Relays for Sat
| urday night, and another big oppor
! tunity for the shattering of world's
! records.
George Anderson and the Troy
high-point team will be there to
start things off. Troy is especially
; gunning for that four-man relay
record of 3:21.6, set by the Stanford
i team of Maynor Shove, Ike and Abe
Hables, and Ben Eastman in 1931.
The S.C. quartet ran 11:13.(5 last
j Saturday with no special compe
tition. And their fourth man was
j Estel Johnson, regular half-miler.
By replacing Johnson with Al
Fitch, a faster man. and with the
impetus supplied hy Jimmy Lu
valie's Uclan team and Al Black -
j man's Card team, the record can
be had by Troy.
i What a quartet Troy would have
with the services of Harry Tomp
! kins, the "Arizona Wildcat," who
1 was elected co-captain for this year
j but has been off the track with an
infected leg! He came close to 48
! seconds flat more than once, and
placed in the 1.C.4-A.

S.C. GOT SOME
MORE TRACKMEN

Down at S.C. they have scraped to
gether another pretty fair frosh
f team. Here are some of the better
| marks:
j Tex Milner has thrown the jav
elin over 210 feet .and he is fol
lowed by Chuck Sopcr. who has

beaten 200. This relieves tl«*—
partment weak ever since Jesse
Mortenson and the Williamsons
left.
Dslos Thurber has high jumped G
feet (5 inches, another Troy depart
ment needing a boost.
Don Skinner has leaped beyond
24 feet in the broad jump. Dean
Cromwell has no pressing need for
a broad jumper, but he i:; groorfting
j Skinner for ihe Olympics. "
] Adrian Talley has run the century
'{ twice in 9.8 seconds.
Bud Day has done 13.fi in the pole
! vault.

SOME SELECTED
SHORT DASHES

Hunt Kingsbury is very definitely
up again among ihe better hurdlers
I —he was even with Klwppy at the
60-yard mark Saturday in a 14.4
race. . . . Milton Holt, the Fresno
State sprinter who beat George An
| derson in high school, is supposed to
have run a 9.8 century in his street
| clothes. . . . The Joe Gonzales who
!ian the two-mile for S.C. was the
: same who had pitched Troy's base
j ball team into a tie for the league
pennant the week-end before. . . .
A great mile looms for the Prince
ton Invitational Meet June 15 when
Glenn Cunningham, Bill Bonthron.
