in the last half of the fifth, the D.U.'s
scored three runs for their win over

in the box to strike out six men in a
1 row and hold the Forgers hitless in
the last two innings.

Although it won them only a tie
! for second place, the El Toro hard

One league Softball championship
was won and another protested as a
result of yesterday's intramural
games. Delta Upsilon trounced the
Forgers, 5 to 2, to take the title in
League V. and the Breakers out
scored the Betas, G to 5, in a League
VI tussle, only to have their ap
parent victory questioned.
Play for League Title
Two undefeated teams met for the
crown in League VI. and the Break
-1 ers scored lour valid runs in the
first inning. The Betas came back
with two in the second, but the hall
i nine placed men on second and
third with two out in their half. A
base-runner was then apparently
hit, at least in the sweatshirt, by a
batted ball, but the umpire allowed
the two Breaker runs which counted
, on the play.
