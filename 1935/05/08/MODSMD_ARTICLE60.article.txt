i Guaymas.
Here, without doubt, is one of j
i the most beautiful harbors in the j
world. At a first glance the Bay of |
Guaymas seems to be a placid
I mountain lake, but when you get j
moseying around in one of the fish
i ing launches you soon come upon '
| the channel which leads into the l
\ Gulf of Lower California. Every j
I two weeks one of the large freight-
I ers calls at Guaymas to pick up fruit,
j vegetables, fish, and perhaps some
I cocoa or coffee for the States. With
I this small traffic the port has not
j been disfigured by warehouses or
J wnarves; in fact, it is the same as it
was five hundred years ago save that
| a few motor launches have replaced
j some of the more ancient fishing
| smacks.
I was beseiged by a score of en
' terprising natives who all knew
; where the biggest fish could be
! caught with the least effort. That
j sounded good to me, but I didn't
| have any tackle. Oh, they had that,
j they assured me in Spanish, French,
German, and English. Absolutely
, everything. Poles, lines, lures,
| gaffs, nets, everything complete,
j O.K. Seven o'clock tomorrow morn
| ing.
r Seven o'clock came and I was i

settled comfortably in the stern of a
spacious launch. An awning, which
long, long ago boasted stripes,
shielded the owner, three roast
chickens, cheese, bread, red wine,
and myself from the first warm rays
of the sun. But where was the
tackle? Victor, that was the guide,
was no longer unable to understand
my Spanish and had apparently for
gotten the English he had been
spouting so vociferously the evening
before. At the end of a half hour's
cruise he opened one ol the side
board lockers and brought forth a
drop line with a trolling spoon and
a doorknob fastened to* the end. It
then dawned upon me that here was
the tackle. I was too content to be
annoyed, so I tossed the line over
board and let it play out. Well, I
won't go into the details; the plain
statistics will .have to suffice. Six
hours later Victor nosed the launch
into the sea wall in front of the
hotel and in the bottom of that boat
lay 60 kilograms of raw, unadulter
ated, scintillating fish.
Truthfully, I was more than a
little apprehensive of the food I was
going to encounter in Mexico. I had
heard tales of a perpetual diet of
eggs, beans, and tamales. Like most
everything else I'd heard of Mexico,
the truth was just the opposite.
