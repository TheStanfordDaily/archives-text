to be presented May 31 in the As- ,
sembly Hall.
The women who have been
chosen arc: Frit/.i Kolstcr, Ma Lou 1
Dobbs, Virginia Kooney, Marga- ;
ret Downey, Margot Lcland, Kay
Arthur, Honey Wcstbrook. nnd I
Frances Burke. The selection was j
made as a result of tryouts held
yesterday afternoon and Friday at
2 o'clock.
Under the direction of Harriet Hall 1
Kilby the chorus will begin re
hearsals today. The dances, says !
Mrs. Kilby, will resemble those seen '
in the Gaieties. Simple but effective |
costumes will be worn in the num
bers, originated by Mrs. Kilby. One j
number is a colorful and elaborate
extravaganza and contrast will be
provided by a novelty number.
Six of the eight members of the I
chorus danced in the Gaieties, and j
all have participated in campus en- j
tertainments. Kay Arthur is well
known for the part she has played in
dramatic and musical productions. I
