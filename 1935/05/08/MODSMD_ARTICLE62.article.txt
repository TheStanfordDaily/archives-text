GRIDIRON GRADUATES
The Editor, Sir:*
I note with extreme disapproval
the blast of the "Eight Seniors"
against the idea of having com
mencement exercises in the Stadium.
It seems to me a splendid plan,
fraught with enchanting possibilities.
Down the 220-yard straightaway
and into the Stadium, scene of so
many Stanford triumphs and dis
asters, will sprint the class of 1935
in all its cap and gowned splendor,
academic robes flapping in the
breeze. Then there will be a quick
change to the football motif, as Sen
ior Class President Jim Triolo, who,
happily enough, has also served as
yell leader, will take his place and
lead the assembled multitudes in a
yell for the class of 1935 as it trips
gracefully on the field for the kick
off into the great games of life.
And then, with the goal posts fes
tooned with diplomas, the seniors
will line up in the center of the
field and battle it out. lor a pass
port into the cold, cruel world.
It might be mentioned that there
is also a school of thought within
the class which favors the idea of
having commencement exercise on
the polo field. Through the cour
tesy of the R.0.T.C., the June grad
uates could come galloping down the
field and grab their diplomas a la
merry go round style.
There is also a faction which fa
vors having the exercises on the golf
course. Then a diploma could be
hidden in every hole and sand trap
and the merry chase would proceed
over hill and dale a la treasure hunt
style.
But I still string along with the
Stadium plan. It's just too intrigu
ing.
