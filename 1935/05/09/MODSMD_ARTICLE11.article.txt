# Rapid Exchange of Chain 'Factories' in Missouri
## 
### 
SPRINGFIELD. Mo'., May 8 </P).—
Chain letter "factories" — $18,000
changed hands at three of them
within five hours — turned this
Southwestern Missouri city today
into a money-mad maelstrom.
A whirlpool of humanity—society
women, waitresses, college students,
and taxi drivers — jammed down
town streets. Women .shoved each
other roughly in a bargain counter
rush on the numerous chain head
quarters.
