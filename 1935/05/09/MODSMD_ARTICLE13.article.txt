# Work on Quad Finished Soon
## 
### 
With only a few weeks left in
which to finish up work on the
yearbook, both the business and edi
torial sides of the Quad settle down
to the last hard work of the year.
The several new features of this
year's Quad are making it different
from any books of previous years,
editor Ev Moses said. The art work
is one of the book's most outstand
ing features. The plates were done
by J. Paget-Fredericks, who is well
known for his work both in Europe
and America. His studies of the
internationally known dancer, Pav
lowa, are his outstanding work.
Entirely new page layouts arc be
ing made possible by means of the
use of the new offset? lithograph
process. And the feature known as
"candid photography," which gets
its name from catching people at
unsuspecting moments, was made
possible through use of a miniature
camera which could be easily hid
den.
Due to the work of the artist al
ready mentioned, the business staff
has been busy attending 1o mail
orders. For those who don't, have to
depend on mail, Quads will be on
sale from 8 to 12 this morning in
front of the post office.
