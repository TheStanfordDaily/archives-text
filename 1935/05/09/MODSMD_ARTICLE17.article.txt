# 'Yellow Jack' Property Men Use Ingenuity
## Two Complete Stage Sets Constructed by Crew For Production Drums, Bugles, Rifles Give Off-Stage Noises 
### Annalec Whitmore 
Dramatic Council seems to have
accomplished the impossible for to
morrow evening's performance of
"Yellow Jack."
Th?y not only obtained an out
standing current play, the work of
Sidney Howard, but also planned an
elaborate set of a type never at
tempted before, and cut ticket prices
to the new low prices of 25, 50 and
75 cents.
The property crew also faced
perplexing problems. They had to
construct two separate stages,
both complete with light bridges
and technical equipment. Then
they added a home-made revolv
ing circle supported by a single
Ford wheel.
It remained for Ihe off-stage noise
directors, Josephine Avis and Zoe
Rutherford, to find a tiring squad
and an authentic African drum.
Volley from Real Guns
Real rifles will be used. To pro
duce a volley of shot, Phil Brown,
Howard McCully, Cabby Caballero,
and Josephine Avis will fire shots
out of a stage window at the neces
sary moment.
An Indian tom-tom, said Miss
Avis, did not produce a deep thud
as required by the script. They at
last found a drum made by Frank
Van Schaeck from an old barrel
and dried skins.
Phonograph Plays March
A snare drum to add atmosphere
'to the military camp scene was do
nated by a music shop, and an off
stage band will add "Stars and
Stripes Forever" by means of a
phonograph record.
Buglers, playing every call from
reveille to taps, and a quartet
singing old-time songs complete
the necessary sound effects.
Rifles were obtained from a vet
eran of several foreign wars and
some, says Miss Avis, have actually
been used in warfare.
Cuhhison Loans Uniforms
Uniforms, also authentic, were
lent by Colonel Donald Cubbison.
They are the type which was worn
during the Spanish-American war,
when the action of the play took
place. Jean Adams serves as ward
robe mistress.
Ticket sale for the production will
continue today at the A.S.S.U. office
in the Old Union. The curtain will

ning in the Assembly Hall.
