# Chemists Set Lake on Fire
## 
### 
Searsville Lake presented the un
usual picture of fires and explosions
on its surface yesterday evening as
60 chemists ended their annual pic
nic with the traditional throwing of
sodium into the water.
Organic chemists, headed by Peter
Jurs, returned to the campus with
the baseball championship safely
theirs, having won over Arnold
Steiner and his physical chemists
by the close score of 19 to 10. No
one knew how many innings had
been played by the time supper was
served, and there was some argu
ment over whether or not the limit
of 20 men to a team had been ex
ceeded.
Phi Lambda Upsilon trounced
Alpha Chi Sigma in the
meet earlier in the afternoon by the
score of 1.'5 to 1. Ail other activities
ceased when the food arrived, and
GO chemists did it ample justice.
