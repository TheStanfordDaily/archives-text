# Kahn Gives VieWs On Amendment
## 
### 
Student. Body President Marvie
Kahn issued the following statement
in connection with the special elec
tion next Tuesday, on the proposed
amendment to prohibit graduate
members from running for highest
student body offices:
"If this amendment passes there
is no doubt in my "mind that, the
take, is to ask the University to
dissolve their present affiliation with
next, step which the graduates will
the Associated Students altogether.
The graduate students are perfectly
capable of forming their own gi'ad
uate association but naturally this
two-association set-up is a pian
which would be detrimental to the
Stanford student body.
''What hurts most is that if the
graduate student takes this step to
withdraw his financial and moral
support, our student body govern
ment and its important student ac
tivities w'l! suffer. The new Memo
rial Theater's construction is en
dangered. the Stanford Daily will
be forcer to operate on a margin
which is one-third the size of its
present budget, and the debating
budget will have to be decreased.
Many other fine activities will be
suppressed financially.
"The graduate student has proven
himself to be unselfish. The small
minority of undergraduates who are
sponsoring the proposal are so sold
on supporting certain nominees for
the A.S.S.U. presidency and vice
presidency. that they have failed to
consider what future havoc may
result from the passage of such a
measure. We must not forget that
the graduate makes up a very sub
stantial part of the student body.
Besides contributing as much money
to the Association as the undergrad
uate, he has also, contributed very
valuable advice and service to bet
ter student activities and student
government on the whole.
"I am sure that the electorate will
weigh the arguments for the defeat
of this amendment. I wish to say in
Closing, that this is my personal
view of what may happen in case
the necessary two-thirds votes are
cast in favor of this short-sighted
and purely political maneuver."
