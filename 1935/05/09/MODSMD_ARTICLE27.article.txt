# STADIUM CHOICE REASONS GIVEN
## Memorial Church Seating Capacity Insufficient 
### 
Jim Triolo, senior class president,
strongly urged members of the grad
uating class to co-operate with the
decision of the Committee of Public
Exercises to hold graduating exer
cises in the stadium, tit last night's
senior meeting.
Dr. Robert E. Swain, chairman
of the Public Exercises Committee,
told about 75 members of the class
last night that a graduation cere
mony in the Memorial Church was
next to imposible because of the in
adequate seating capacity.
For the past three years, Dr.
Swain pointed out, graduation ex
ercises have been seriously cramped
because of the small size of the
church. The use of the chapel has
brought waves of criticism on the
University from alumni and other
friends of the University because
they have been unable to attend the
ceremonies. This year there will be
an unlimited supply of admission
tickets for all seniors.
The graduating class alone this
year will number 1000 students,
while the seating capacity of the
church is approximately 2000, al
lowing only a small minority of
thqse desiring to attend to do so.
Studies of the position of the sun
on the day of graduation have been
made through the Comptroller's of
fice. From these studies, it has been
planned to hold the exercises in the
north end of the stadium at 4:30
o'clock in the afternoon.
The stadium would be made over
for the occasion, and adequate
shrubs would be provided to set ofl
the stands appropriately.
Previous to Dr. Swain's talk, Milt
Friedman, class treasurer, asked all
seniors to pay their dues and prom
ised a senior prom should enough
money be collected.
