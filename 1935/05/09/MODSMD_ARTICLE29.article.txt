# Dr. DeVoss Speaks On Personality Problem
## 
### 
Dr. James DeVoss, dean of the up
per division of San Jose State Col
lege, spoke last night on "Person
ality Problems with Camp Age
Groups" at a meeting of the class in
camp counselors' training. In an
informal talk, followed by a brief
discussion period. Dr. DeVoss
sketched the approach that should
be adopted by counselors in coping
with child problem cases.
The fundamental propositions of
dealing with human beings, said Dr.
DeVoss, are that the human person
ality is enormously complex, infi
nitely modifiable, and basically val
uable; with this in view, personality
problems should be met objectively
rather than egoccntrically. As a
conclusion. Dr. DeVoss presented
various solutions of specific prob
lem cases.
