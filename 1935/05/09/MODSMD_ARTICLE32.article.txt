# Wilbur, Kahn, Others Conduct Discussion Of Student Control Tonight
## Conclave Will Take Place In Little Theater At 7:30 o'clock ALL MAY PARTICIPATE Pi Lambda Theta Panel Leads to Meeting 
### Herb Diamond 
Vexing issues presently confront
ing student government at Stanford
will hang fire tonight at 7:30 o'clock
in the Little Theater when both stu
dents and faculty members alike
gather to hear Dr. Ray Lyman Wil
bur's talk on the subject and then to
discuss proposed solutions to the
problems pointed out.
Armed with a goodly supply of
questions designed to keep the
semi-panel conclave popping will
be Dr. Ilarohl C. Hand, Dean
Mary Yost, Miss Louise Price, De
bater Dave MellinkofT, Kenneth
Livingston, Conference President
Marion Storey, and A.S.S.U; Pres
ident Marvie K'»hn. Prepared for
the session they will swing into
action at the close of Dr. Wilbur's
comments seeking out an increas
ingly wide range of problems for
constructive criticism. Many loop
holes in the present system of stu
dent government on the Farm will
be considered and courses of fu
ture action at least determined.
Relations of student governing
bodies, their added functions, pro
gressive innovations, and new situa
tions which must be met are but a
few of the varied pertinent phases on
the program. The meeting, termed
an outgrowth of the first Pi Lambda
Theta panel session on student gov
ernment, will be thrown open to all
members of the student body and
faculty. Its subject, in the eyes of
Kahn, is worthy of the entire cam
pus' attention.
Due, however, to the limited seat
ing capacity in the Little Theater
and the large attendance expected,
he advises the early arrival of every
one who hopes to gain a seat in the
proceedings.
Much bearing directly upon the
status of student government at
Stanford will be brought to light,
promises the student president.
Campus governing bodies, he adds,
must constantly be alive to and
able to cope with the increasing
problcAis that accompany added
functions, and in a discussion of
this nature every Farm student is
entitled to a part Additional com
ment and any further questions
that may arise will lve Invited
from the audience.
The objective will be the gaining
of as wide a perspective of student
government and its current prob
lems as possible through a somewhat,
informal exchange of ideas. Plans
for subsequent confabs, similar in
nature to tonight's, are already un
der way.

Vexing issues presently confront
ing student government at Stanford
will hang fire tonight at 7:30 o'clock
in the Little Theater when both stu
dents and faculty members alike
gather to hear Dr. Ray Lyman Wil
bur's talk on the subject and then to
discuss proposed solutions to the
problems pointed out.
Armed with a goodly supply of
questions designed to keep the
semi-panel conclave popping will
be Dr. Ilarohl C. Hand, Dean
Mary Yost, Miss Louise Price, De
bater Dave MellinkofT, Kenneth
Livingston, Conference President
Marion Storey, and A.S.S.U; Pres
ident Marvie K'»hn. Prepared for
the session they will swing into
action at the close of Dr. Wilbur's
comments seeking out an increas
ingly wide range of problems for
constructive criticism. Many loop
holes in the present system of stu
dent government on the Farm will
be considered and courses of fu
ture action at least determined.
Relations of student governing
bodies, their added functions, pro
gressive innovations, and new situa
tions which must be met are but a
few of the varied pertinent phases on
the program. The meeting, termed
an outgrowth of the first Pi Lambda
Theta panel session on student gov
ernment, will be thrown open to all
members of the student body and
faculty. Its subject, in the eyes of
Kahn, is worthy of the entire cam
pus' attention.
Due, however, to the limited seat
ing capacity in the Little Theater
and the large attendance expected,
he advises the early arrival of every
one who hopes to gain a seat in the
proceedings.
Much bearing directly upon the
status of student government at
Stanford will be brought to light,
promises the student president.
Campus governing bodies, he adds,
must constantly be alive to and
able to cope with the increasing
problcAis that accompany added
functions, and in a discussion of
this nature every Farm student is
entitled to a part Additional com
ment and any further questions
that may arise will lve Invited
from the audience.
