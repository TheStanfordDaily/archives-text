Last the senior class met with Dr.
Swain. Thev came cynically, but they <le
parted with spirits much higher and the feel
ing that commencement this year will not by
any means be an absurd ceremony, merely
because it will be held in the stadium.
I here were a few things the seniors did
not realize. They did not know that the class
olbccrs were consulted as to the advisability
of transferring the graduation locale from the
C.liapel to the stadium. Nor did thev fully
realize that it is Stanford I'niversity which
graduates the class, and for that reason is in
complete charge of arrangements as to the
exercises and pays the expenses of commence
ment.
<M<| Mull Sessioner hit the nail on the head
when he spoke of fond parents peering around
pillars trying to get a perspiring glimpse at
their beloved progeny clad in the black and
white robes of academic honor. In the sla
(liuin, parents and relatives to their heart's
content will be able to view the ceremonies,
and even the Palo Alto residents will no doubt
be on hand. Thev don't seem to miss any-
I hing else.
