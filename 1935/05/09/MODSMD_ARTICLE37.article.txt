in ;i course that has no syllabus.
lit the first place the name, syllabus fees,
is a misnomer. The title is purely historical.
It dates back to former times when the fees
were ;i major consideration to the Hough so
far us I'nivcrsity expenses were concerned.
Now the fees are lived by the President and
are ailotted to the departments to meet ex
penses not covered by the regular budget.
These fees, furthermore, cover the cost of
readers, of necessary equipment, of the sylla
bus, and of instruction in elementary subjects
which should have been taken care of in high
school.
Because of the great inequality of the levies
in Ihe various departments, an "average'" fee
could not be justifiably and fairly adminis
tered on the entire student body. The Hough,
consequently, will continue to receive during
the remainder of his college career a little bill
toward the middle of the quarter demanding
Ihe payment of fees from lil'ty cents up to liftv
dollars, depending on his choice of subjects.

more appropriate and descriptive name, one
that will define the nature of these quarterly
fees.
