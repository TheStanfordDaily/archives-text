# Speed Laws and Reason
## 
### 
Changing conditions of roads and inolor
vehicles and the capacity of sonic aulos lo lie
driven last with a low danger factor were
recognized yesterday by the Third District
Appellate Court, which granted a writ of ha
beas corpus to a San Francisco man who was
convicted for driving seventy miles an hour.
Certain small communities in California
have been notorious in recent years for the
revenue they have derived from traffic fines,
and local officers have waxed tal under a
system which permits them lo convict a man
for driving, say, forty-seven miles an hour.
A new, modern car in good condition can
easily travel sixty or seventy miles an hour
over some of California's famous highways;
and such driving entails less danger to the
public than a forty-mile speed in a Ford.
The view already adopted in some cities,
lhal fast driving is not a crime unless it comes
under the separate head of reckless driving,
comes more and more into use with such tesl
cases. Common-sense construction of the law
<Â»n such matters will not only speed travel,
but actually make the highways safer by per
mitting only such speeds as the court may
deem advisable, considering the ear, the driv
er, and the road.
