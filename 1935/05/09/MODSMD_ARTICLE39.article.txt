# Hearst Metrotone News: Progaganda?
## 
### 
One collide paper in the country scored a
sweep against Publisher W'illium Randolph
Ileiirsl last week. The Williams liccorri, ed
ited hv Raymond A. McConnell, elTcetively
conducted a campaign against the showing of
the Hears! Metrotone News in the local thea
ter, and won the issue.
Kditor McConnell had a petition circulated
among students and faculty members at Wil
liams. It read in part:
"In the Waldeu theater you show the Hearst
Metrotone News, crammed full of propa
ganda. The latest includes pictures of armies
drilling, 'for the glory of empire' pictures of
big foreign warships being constructed, which
the Hearst commentator urges Americans to
watch out for and to try to outdo. We feel
that by showing these films, you are helping
to spread Hearst propaganda."
The poor owner of the theater couldn't do
much about the situation. The petition was
entirely elTcctive. Isy the second day of cir
culation, one-fourth of the college had signed
it, and confronted with a boycott, alreadv

made real hv the smallest audiences of the
year, the owner Hashed a reader <Â»n the screen
informed the audience of twenty people
thid, in spite of his eontaret, the Hearst Metro
tone News would no longer he shown and
the victory was won.
Attendance bounced back to normal. The
light against the Metrotone was successful.
It this were a really important issue and the
newspaper had won as it did, there would be
more importance to attach to the event. Hut
small as it is, it represents an increasing pres
tige o! the collegiate press, and as such, Kdilor
Mcdonncll is to be complimented.
