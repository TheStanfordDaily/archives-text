# New Type Chain Letter Unsound, Say Economists
## 
### Robert Eisenbach 
A new type of chain letter, pro
tecting the participant from the loss
of his investment and involving a
dollar instead of a dime, appeared to
day in campus and Palo Alto mails,
rumored to be the Invention of a
Stanford student.
Chief innovation is the sale of the
five new letters extending the chain
at 25 cents apiece instead of their
free presentation to friends. By this
means, the letter points out, the par
ticipant keeps hi.s original invest
ment and gains a quarter for Trail
ing costs. One five-letter cycle of
the chain will net over $15,000, its
originator claims.
Meanwhile, members of the eco
nomics faculty followed Uncle Sam's
legal condemnation of the chain let
ter, by branding the idea as "ridicu
lous" and "impossible as a profit
making scheme."
"It is simply an exchange of mon
ey, regardless of the unit used," de
cjlared Francis E. Mclntyre, in
structor in economics. 'In the final
analysis, no one loses or gains, ex
cept for the amount spent on post
age. As an economically sound
money-making idea, the chain let
ter is absolutely false.
"The dollar letter, with the re
imbursement provision tacked on
docs not change the essential falla
cies in the system. It simply means
that an additional $1.25 is changing
hands," he said.
