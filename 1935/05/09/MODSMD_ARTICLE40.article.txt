# WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE NEW DEAL?

### CROMPTON BANCS, Jr 
Till'] VESTED.
INTERESTS IN Ml A

There are some things about the NfJA that vhe
government does its best to keep in the dark. These
things are the vested interests of the Blue Eagle:
33,000 jobholders and quite a few mfiidly growing
monopolies.
Just now there are 7,000 NRA employees here in
Washington, they are mostly politieal jobholders, good
Democrats and lunkheads all. Besides we have 2G,000
more parasites in the code authorities, supported
mostly by assessments on the individual industry mem
bers. These people spend their time with their feet on
the desk dictating threatening letters to members who
won't keep in line. Somthing like the old Capone
beer-gang days in Chicago. But the administration
doesn t dare kick them out; they are all voters, have
relatives and write regularly to their Congressman.
F'.ll.'s cousin made a great reputation as a trust
buster. Before we are through with the Blue Eagle
F.K. himself will have to do a lot more trust bust
ing than "Teddy" ever did. Most industries where
there are a few powerful members have gotten
together, fixed prices, squeezed out undesirable
competition, and skinned the consumer—all un
der the cloak of government regutuition. Naturally
they want the NRA; it makes possible what was
previously illegal, and does it in such a way that
the Administration doesn't dare say anything for
fear of exposing its two-faced policy of pretend
ing to be the people's friend while sponsoring the
very monopolies it was pledged to present.

PROHIBITION DAYS
ARE HERE AGAIN

Like its preceding "noble experiment" NRA code
enforcement has become a joke. There are more ways
of getting around it than the speakeasy days ever
thought of. Even if a violator is brought into court,
in 99 cases out of a hundred the NRA hasn't a leg to
stand on. Why? As far as the law is concerned, it is
almost entirely unconstitutional.
The NRA was written purely as an emergency
measure. In the act all powers were delegated to the
President to re-delegate to the various administrative
agencies set up under the act and by his orders. In
the opinion of most lawyers and judges the delegation
is so broad that it is unconstitutional.
Then the NRA is a usurpation of state's rights in
that it delegates to code authorities through the Presi
dent things included only in the police powers of
states, as for example, federal control of prices for
purely intrastate businesses. Unless the Supreme
Court takes a broader view of interstate commerce
than ever before, and leaves practically nothing to
the states, the NRA will be found unconstitutional.
It is pretty generally known that Professor
Felix Frankfurter of Harvard Law School advised
the President to put off all tests of NKA until
every state had enacted a state NRA just like the
national one and until "a solid record of achieve
ment had been built up." Only few states have
state NRA's; some have already repealed them, as
has New Jersey, and there is very little achieve
ment, except for the 33.000 employes, some monop
olies, a bumper crop of strikes, and plenty of
headaches for business in general.
The only solid accomplishments are the outlawing
of child labor and the attempt to fix minimum wages.
Even these are regularly violated, especially in New
Jersey, South Carolina, and Georgia.
Nobody can enforce an unpopular law. Public opin
ion against the NRA has been growing steadily; it is too
li te lor the propaganda wave that launched it to do any
good. On this point two very significant things hap
pened last week. Senator Borah advised his Idaho
constituents to ignore NRA codes, disregard fees and
fines, and to conduct their own business in their own
way, and to let him know if the government tried to
interfere. Several other senators have privately told
their electorate ihc same thing.
Then in New Jersey, which has repealed its state
NRA. the state administration has warned all code
authority collectors that they will be jailed if they at
tempt to collect assessments. This startling statement
is based on two things: (1) a federal court decision
holding the NRA illegal; and (2) city ordinances mak
ing unauthorized soliciting of funds disorderly conduct.
Other states are getting ready to do the same ihing.
On Thursday and Friday Solicitor-General Reed
and Mr. Richberg were given a thorough grilling by
six justices of the Supreme Court —including three so
called "liberals." Their attempt to explain the NRA as
applied to the Schecter Bros. (Brooklyn poultry deal
ers) was pretty sad.

IS THE BLUE BUZZARD
READY FOR THE STEW?

In spite of all this tin* President wants to con
tinue the NKA for two years more. The best he
can get from Congress is 10 months with price
fixing and local business control eliminated. To
save bis face F.R. must continue the NKA no
matter what the cost. Remember, it was bis great
experiment. The public response to his Hut fire
side chat was very, very disappointing.
There are numerous reasons to suspect that Mr.
Roosevelt is a poor loser and will never admit he was
wrong about (he NRA. If this happens, the same
thing may befall him as happened to his predecessors
who clung to the "noble experiment" of prohibition
to the bitter end—and defeat.
Tomorrow: AAA.

F'.ll.'s cousin made a great reputation as a trust
buster. Before we are through with the Blue Eagle
F.K. himself will have to do a lot more trust bust
ing than "Teddy" ever did. Most industries where
there are a few powerful members have gotten
together, fixed prices, squeezed out undesirable
competition, and skinned the consumer—all un
der the cloak of government regutuition. Naturally
they want the NRA; it makes possible what was
previously illegal, and does it in such a way that
the Administration doesn't dare say anything for
fear of exposing its two-faced policy of pretend
ing to be the people's friend while sponsoring the
very monopolies it was pledged to present.

PROHIBITION DAYS
ARE HERE AGAIN

Like its preceding "noble experiment" NRA code
enforcement has become a joke. There are more ways
of getting around it than the speakeasy days ever
thought of. Even if a violator is brought into court,
in 99 cases out of a hundred the NRA hasn't a leg to
stand on. Why? As far as the law is concerned, it is
almost entirely unconstitutional.
The NRA was written purely as an emergency
measure. In the act all powers were delegated to the
President to re-delegate to the various administrative
agencies set up under the act and by his orders. In
the opinion of most lawyers and judges the delegation
is so broad that it is unconstitutional.
Then the NRA is a usurpation of state's rights in
that it delegates to code authorities through the Presi
dent things included only in the police powers of
states, as for example, federal control of prices for
purely intrastate businesses. Unless the Supreme
Court takes a broader view of interstate commerce
than ever before, and leaves practically nothing to
the states, the NRA will be found unconstitutional.
It is pretty generally known that Professor
Felix Frankfurter of Harvard Law School advised
the President to put off all tests of NKA until
every state had enacted a state NRA just like the
national one and until "a solid record of achieve
ment had been built up." Only few states have
state NRA's; some have already repealed them, as
has New Jersey, and there is very little achieve
ment, except for the 33.000 employes, some monop
olies, a bumper crop of strikes, and plenty of
headaches for business in general.
The only solid accomplishments are the outlawing
of child labor and the attempt to fix minimum wages.
Even these are regularly violated, especially in New
Jersey, South Carolina, and Georgia.
Nobody can enforce an unpopular law. Public opin
ion against the NRA has been growing steadily; it is too
li te lor the propaganda wave that launched it to do any
good. On this point two very significant things hap
pened last week. Senator Borah advised his Idaho
constituents to ignore NRA codes, disregard fees and
fines, and to conduct their own business in their own
way, and to let him know if the government tried to
interfere. Several other senators have privately told
their electorate ihc same thing.
Then in New Jersey, which has repealed its state
NRA. the state administration has warned all code
authority collectors that they will be jailed if they at
tempt to collect assessments. This startling statement
is based on two things: (1) a federal court decision
holding the NRA illegal; and (2) city ordinances mak
ing unauthorized soliciting of funds disorderly conduct.
Other states are getting ready to do the same ihing.
On Thursday and Friday Solicitor-General Reed
and Mr. Richberg were given a thorough grilling by
six justices of the Supreme Court —including three so
called "liberals." Their attempt to explain the NRA as
applied to the Schecter Bros. (Brooklyn poultry deal
ers) was pretty sad.

IS THE BLUE BUZZARD
READY FOR THE STEW?

In spite of all this tin* President wants to con
tinue the NKA for two years more. The best he
can get from Congress is 10 months with price
fixing and local business control eliminated. To
save bis face F.R. must continue the NKA no
matter what the cost. Remember, it was bis great
experiment. The public response to his Hut fire
side chat was very, very disappointing.
There are numerous reasons to suspect that Mr.
Roosevelt is a poor loser and will never admit he was
wrong about (he NRA. If this happens, the same
thing may befall him as happened to his predecessors
who clung to the "noble experiment" of prohibition
to the bitter end—and defeat.

There are some things about the NfJA that vhe
government does its best to keep in the dark. These
things are the vested interests of the Blue Eagle:
33,000 jobholders and quite a few mfiidly growing
monopolies.
Just now there are 7,000 NRA employees here in
Washington, they are mostly politieal jobholders, good
Democrats and lunkheads all. Besides we have 2G,000
more parasites in the code authorities, supported
mostly by assessments on the individual industry mem
bers. These people spend their time with their feet on
the desk dictating threatening letters to members who
won't keep in line. Somthing like the old Capone
beer-gang days in Chicago. But the administration
doesn t dare kick them out; they are all voters, have
relatives and write regularly to their Congressman.

thought of. Even if a violator is brought into court,
in 99 cases out of a hundred the NRA hasn't a leg to
stand on. Why? As far as the law is concerned, it is
almost entirely unconstitutional.
The NRA was written purely as an emergency
measure. In the act all powers were delegated to the
President to re-delegate to the various administrative
agencies set up under the act and by his orders. In
the opinion of most lawyers and judges the delegation
is so broad that it is unconstitutional.
Then the NRA is a usurpation of state's rights in
that it delegates to code authorities through the Presi
dent things included only in the police powers of
states, as for example, federal control of prices for
purely intrastate businesses. Unless the Supreme
Court takes a broader view of interstate commerce
than ever before, and leaves practically nothing to
the states, the NRA will be found unconstitutional.
It is pretty generally known that Professor
Felix Frankfurter of Harvard Law School advised
the President to put off all tests of NKA until
every state had enacted a state NRA just like the
national one and until "a solid record of achieve
ment had been built up." Only few states have
state NRA's; some have already repealed them, as
has New Jersey, and there is very little achieve
ment, except for the 33.000 employes, some monop
olies, a bumper crop of strikes, and plenty of
headaches for business in general.
The only solid accomplishments are the outlawing
of child labor and the attempt to fix minimum wages.
Even these are regularly violated, especially in New
Jersey, South Carolina, and Georgia.
Nobody can enforce an unpopular law. Public opin
ion against the NRA has been growing steadily; it is too
li te lor the propaganda wave that launched it to do any
good. On this point two very significant things hap
pened last week. Senator Borah advised his Idaho
constituents to ignore NRA codes, disregard fees and
fines, and to conduct their own business in their own
way, and to let him know if the government tried to
interfere. Several other senators have privately told
their electorate ihc same thing.
Then in New Jersey, which has repealed its state
NRA. the state administration has warned all code
authority collectors that they will be jailed if they at
tempt to collect assessments. This startling statement
is based on two things: (1) a federal court decision
holding the NRA illegal; and (2) city ordinances mak
ing unauthorized soliciting of funds disorderly conduct.
Other states are getting ready to do the same ihing.
On Thursday and Friday Solicitor-General Reed
and Mr. Richberg were given a thorough grilling by
six justices of the Supreme Court —including three so
called "liberals." Their attempt to explain the NRA as
applied to the Schecter Bros. (Brooklyn poultry deal
ers) was pretty sad.

IS THE BLUE BUZZARD
READY FOR THE STEW?

In spite of all this tin* President wants to con
tinue the NKA for two years more. The best he
can get from Congress is 10 months with price
fixing and local business control eliminated. To
save bis face F.R. must continue the NKA no
matter what the cost. Remember, it was bis great
experiment. The public response to his Hut fire
side chat was very, very disappointing.
There are numerous reasons to suspect that Mr.
Roosevelt is a poor loser and will never admit he was
wrong about (he NRA. If this happens, the same
thing may befall him as happened to his predecessors
who clung to the "noble experiment" of prohibition
to the bitter end—and defeat.

There are some things about the NfJA that vhe
government does its best to keep in the dark. These
things are the vested interests of the Blue Eagle:
33,000 jobholders and quite a few mfiidly growing
monopolies.
Just now there are 7,000 NRA employees here in
Washington, they are mostly politieal jobholders, good
Democrats and lunkheads all. Besides we have 2G,000
more parasites in the code authorities, supported
mostly by assessments on the individual industry mem
bers. These people spend their time with their feet on
the desk dictating threatening letters to members who
won't keep in line. Somthing like the old Capone
beer-gang days in Chicago. But the administration
doesn t dare kick them out; they are all voters, have
relatives and write regularly to their Congressman.
F'.ll.'s cousin made a great reputation as a trust
buster. Before we are through with the Blue Eagle
F.K. himself will have to do a lot more trust bust
ing than "Teddy" ever did. Most industries where
there are a few powerful members have gotten
together, fixed prices, squeezed out undesirable
competition, and skinned the consumer—all un
der the cloak of government regutuition. Naturally
they want the NRA; it makes possible what was
previously illegal, and does it in such a way that
the Administration doesn't dare say anything for
fear of exposing its two-faced policy of pretend
ing to be the people's friend while sponsoring the
very monopolies it was pledged to present.
