Riijht on the heels of the King and Queen Contest
comes the news of recent extractive industries in con
nection with Labor Day at ihe Convalescent Home.
I'll admit the news is a bit old. but then, everything
comes to him who wastes.
First item concerns the lack of enough ice cream on
Labor Day. But, oddly enough, the cast of "Yellow
Jack" enjoyed the consumption of ten gallons of ice
cream at a rehearsal th;it evening.
Second item concerns a candy and cigarette girl
at the Home, who instituted one of the best rackets in
the history of the Drive.
With an artless air, she stationed herself at the
gate to the Home and charged people 10 cc nts for the
privilege of going in and working. Technically speak
ing, she was selling candy, but when she gave them the
bars, many smiled sweetly, and refused it. Sweet
charity, 1 calls it.
