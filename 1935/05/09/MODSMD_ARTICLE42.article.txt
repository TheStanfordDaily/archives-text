## IN SPRING A YOUNG MAN'S FANCY 
### 
Poetically speaking, in spring a
' young man's fancy is supposed to
! turn to love. And so, that young
man — the Venerable and Cuckoo
Dodderer—cracks out with a Love j
Edition of his sentimental rag. But
politically speaking, in spring a :
young rough's fancy turns to elec- :
toral skullduggery. And so, a group
of young men—principally Row men I
—cracks out with a petition intended
'to stop graduates from filling the j
posts of A.S.S.U. president and vice
president.

Of course, it is rather obvious that
I the Row politicians are out to get
James S. Triolo and remove him
from the May battle for the presi- ,
dency before the battle even starts, j
But regardless of the tactics and the
i personalities involved, what is the i
i real objection to having graduate
'students qualify for the posts of j
Ipiesident, or vice-president, or for
I any other of the political plums and
I pills in the student body hierarchy? ,
I It is claimed that the graduates
j have had a four years' crack at stu- l
I dent body offices, and that now that ,
J they are dead and buried they should
1 remain dead and buried. It is claimed I
that it is unfair to undergraduates |
j that a graduate student who has had
: four years to build up a political
i machine should now step in and
I pre-empt a field rightly belonging
I to the undergraduate.
j But it appears to us that that I
j whole line of reasoning is fallacious ;
! because the assumptions are faLse
j assumptions. The prime assumption
; is that after four years, graduates
are dead—and that the undergrad- j
uate has some peculiar claim to the
student government field.
j If there is any justification for j
j student government (and we doubt
J that there is), it is that students j
j should have some control over the
I conditions under which they must
I live. "And that to secure these i
| ends (to quote roughly from the
I Declarations of Independence), !
j governments are instituted among l
men."
Now, in the first place, the grad
uate students of Stanford University
constitute about one-fourth of the !
total student body. And it would
thus seem that the graduates are
entitled to project their sensitive'
sehnozzolas into the affairs of the
campus. But more important than
that: one of the greatest failings of
student government has been that it
is conducted in lackadaisical, ig- I
norant fashion. To us, it appears that
the graduate leavening in the col
| lege-bred is -a healthful thing. We 1
| are reminded that some of the most !
sensible student body presidents I
and Ex Committee members that
Stanford has ever had (or has at the
! present time) have been graduates. |
| A connecting link between the
j enthusiasm of the undergraduate \
j and the experience of the faculty,
I the graduate meets a definite need
j in the councils of student govern- <
| ment. The Elder Statesmen should
j be retained.
