# Spring Rains Maintain High Level in Lagunita
## 
### 
Lagunita is usually drained long ,
before May, according to officials at
the campus engineer's office. Ex- '
ceptional rains have preserved the |
lake beyund its usual life span, 1
placing (he level of Searsville and
Felt lakes, as well as that of La- ,
gunita, at all-time highs.
Lowest level on engineering do- J
partmcnt records is that of 1932, the I
first year that lake content was offi
cially measured, when water stood
at 34 feet. The 1935 level is 36.G
feet.
