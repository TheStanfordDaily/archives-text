# Spring Rains Maintain High Level in Lagunita
## 
### 
Lagunita is usually drained long
before May, according to officials at
the campus engineer's office. Ex-
ceptional rains have preserved the
lake beyond its usual life span,
placing the level of Searsville and
Felt lakes, as well as that of La-
gunita, at all-time highs.
Lowest level on engineering de-
partment records is that of 1932, the
first year that lake content was offi
cially measured, when water stood
at 3½ feet. The 1935 level is 36.6
feet.
