# THE

## "GO INTO YOUR DANCE" At the Stanford Theater 
### 
Warner Brothers have a produc
tion which they call "A Musical
Hit" — you know — "Forty-Second
Street—Gold Diggers of 1934 and
1935 —Footlight Parade" — and far
into the night! This is the latest and
most unusual of the series—unusual

because it does
n't attempt to be
more stupendous
than its prede
cessor. An at
tempt to discuss
the plot would
be a senseless
enumeration of

repetitious tripe. Jolson produces a
stage show, has his difficulties, but
produces his show and the audience
applauds the production, which
probably covered four of Warner
Bros, extra-spacious stages in the
making. Musical numbers are, as
usual, good and include "She's a
Latin from Manhattan," "Go Into
Your Dance," "This Evening at a
Quarter to Nine," and ' The Little
Things You Used To Do." The cast
is composed of the Warner Bros,
stock-company.
