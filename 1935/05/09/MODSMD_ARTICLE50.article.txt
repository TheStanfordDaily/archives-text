# Deadly Defense Devices Evolved Secretly by U.S.
## Rapid-Fire Navy Guns, High Speed Tanks, Guarded By Government Costly Experiments Perfect New Explosives 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 8 (/P).—With
rapid-fire navy guns, a new high
speed army tank and more powerful
explosives to the forefront, the na
tion's military forces were reported
today to have evolved in secret a
lengthening list of deadly defense
devices.
Guarded jealously from public
scrutiny, the new inventions re
portedly were nearer perfection as
the result of costly post-war experi
ments. Officials were reticent even
to name some of the weapons and
.•ientific devices now being devel
oped. But a survey today listed
some of these new assurances against
foreign invasion:
Army Defense
The Army—Still unphotographed
seven- and 15-ton tanks with im
proved armor protection, greater
gun power and a speed range of 70
miles an hour over highways and 40
miles overaldn; fast light combat
cars equipped with sponge rubber
tires, turrets, .50-caliber machine
guns and one-pounders; a pack
howitzer which, though it weighs
only 2,700 pounds and can be carried
by six mules, is claimed by experts
to shoot as far as (he famous French
75-mm. gun of the World War; semi
automatic rifles for doughboys with
three times the firing speed of the
standard Springfield rifle.
Navy Defense
The Navy — Five- and six-inch
rapid fire guns with greater ranges
and armor - piercing power, more
than 250 of which are being manu
factured at the naval gun factory
here; greater fuel efficiency for
boosting the striking cruising radius;
ammunition which throws projec
tiles farther and makes torpedoes
more deadly; new chemical war
fare defenses; diving bells for res
cuing crews of sunken submarines;
sound detectors for locating enemy
submarines; surface vessels and air
craft; stronger and lighter armor;
gyro control for range finders.
