# Resistance of Building To Earthquakes Studied
## 
### SALLIE TABER 
To satisfy the flippant desire # of;
some Eastern students to be initiated
into the thrills of a California earth
quake, a visit is recommended to
the shaking table used by Stanford
engineers for vibration research.
The purpose of the machine is to
test theories about the temblor-re
sistant construction of buildings. So
far the practical results of the ex
periments have been meager, and
only a few generalizations have been
made. The investigators have dis
covered that light, strong buildings
are better than heavy ones—brick
for example—and that it is better to
lay lumber in diagonal lines instead
of using the conventional horizon
tal method of construction.
The shaking table consists of a
three-ton platform mounted on four
street-car wheels and anchored by
springs to concrete piers. Models are
placed on this platform and a syn
thetic earthquake is produced by
the punch of a pendulum swung
against a bumper spring on the table
or by the rotation of an unbalanced
flywheel. The first method pro
duces the transitory, oscillating
movement characteristic of the usual
earthquake. The fundamental type

j of vibration observed in the model
is similar to the reeling, swaybacked
motion of a drunken mah.
An earthquake has rhythm, and
when it harmonizes with the natural
! tempo of buildings, the tendency to
i move to and fro is greater with jars
i of certain length than with others.
When such harmony in tempos is es
! tablished, the buildings shimmy like
j jelly. Thus the amount of damage
; done depends more on the periods or
j tempos of the shocks than on their
i intensities.
Lagunita dormitory, which is a
| steel frame building, is one of the
most rigid and one of the most
j earthquake - resistant constructions
I in California.
From a scientific standpoint the
last great quake, which centered
near Long Beach, had a redeeming
| feature. It revealed the weaknesses
!of poorly constructed houses and
stores and proved the value of build
ing with an eye to future emer
gencies. Engineers declare it is pos
j sible to build houses capable of
withstanding shocks hitherto felt,
although there is, no positive guar
tee that the future holds nothing
i worse in store.

j tempos of the shocks than on their
i intensities.
Lagunita dormitory, which is a

From a scientific standpoint the
last great quake, which centered
near Long Beach, had a redeeming
| feature. It revealed the weaknesses
!of poorly constructed houses and
stores and proved the value of build
ing with an eye to future emer
gencies. Engineers declare it is pos
j sible to build houses capable of
withstanding shocks hitherto felt,
although there is, no positive guar
tee that the future holds nothing
i worse in store.
