# TRACKSTERS RELY ON FIELD EVENTS FOR FRESNO MEET
## Expect Points from Levy, Mottram, Reynolds 
### Warren Breed 
Stanford's famed "thin red line"
being short of runners and power
less on the track, for the Fresno
Relays Dink Templeton's men will
have to run true to tradition and
rely on .the field events for then
points.
In the field the Cards will bring to
the Raisin City men who 'can win
the three weight events. Jimmy
Mottram in the jaVelin, Phil Levy
in the discus, and Jim Reynolds in
the shot can each carry away blue
ribbons.
Competition Strong
The trio will not win with a mere
twist of the wrist, though, for strong
men from the Olympic Club will also
be stripped for action. John Lyman,
Bobby Jones, and Gordie Dunn,
three ex-Stanfordites who are work
ing out at Angell Field, will oppose
Levy, Reynolds, and A1 Hershey.
Mottram. will have big Ed Water
bury, formerly of Cal and now a
Club man, and Norman Fitzgerald,
over whom victory would be sweet.
Humbert Smith, the fellow who
gave promise of scaling the heights
in early season, will not jump Sat
urday night. Dink plans to give him
a good rest, pointing for the bigger
meets to come.
Depend on Klopstock
Aside from the tossing events the
next most fertile ground for Cardi
nal points will be in the open high
hurdle race. Sammy Klopstock, who
has a 14.2 flight bulging out some
where, will run, and should win
from any field.
Sammy will be a busy fellow at
Fresno, for he will be running in
the sprint relays as well. He ran a
352 in practice last night in 37.9,
which is right next to the time Ben
Eastman used to tour the distance in.
Dud Sales, handsome javelin
thrower who is gunning for the
1.C.4-A. trip, will also be in the
swim. He has improved a bit in
every meet all year, his latest and
best being 206 feet in the P.A. meet.
Troy May Take Relays
In the six relay events, the ter
rible Trojans from Los Angeles are
possibilities for a clean sweep. Their
four sprinters are better than any
other team can muster, especially
now that Cal has declared Mushy
Pollock out. Their mile and two
mile relay teams are fool-proof, and
their shuttle hurdle team one of
the best ever assembled.
Records will be endangered right
and leftâ€”in the 100, discus, pole
vault, high jump, and mile relay.
The Cards, 21 strong, will leave by j
bus after lunch Friday afternoon.
