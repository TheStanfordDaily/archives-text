MEDLEY RELAY
WON'T DISAPPOINT

I 'Saturday Fresno continues its tra
i edition of presenting the classic of
! California track festivals. At the
■ Fresno Relays the spring appetites
! of the local athletic enthusiasts have
! their fill. There'll be competition
I from early morning till way after
' the lights go on. California's great
! est college and club athletes will be
■ there, apd a host of prep school aces
i for the scouts to watch.
One race that will stand plenty
! of ballyhoo is the medley relay.
\ It will be a combination of a
i Blackmail - LuValle - McCarthy
i quarter, a Nimmo - Brace - Bush
i half mile, a Heavy-March-Wall
three laps, and a Bright-Fowler
! Dixon-Benavidez mile, which is
i some order. The four favorites,
j U.S.C., Stanford, California, and
j the Olympic Club have their ace
runners so staggered that a see
saw battle is almost sure to re
sult.
The Trojans should have a lead
after McCarthy runs the quarter and
Bush the half. But Zamperini, the
Trojan third man, is not so strong,
and Stanford with March, California
' with Bob Heavey, and the Club with
j Johnny Wall are sure to close the
j gap. March proved to himself last
! Saturday that he is faster than
| Zamperini when he finished with a
sprint that would have caught the
Trojan had the race been 20 yards
longer. Wall, a really great runner,
trailed Bright in his 4:17 mile two
weeks ago and is at home in the best
company. Heavey, the critics say,
doesn't know yet how fast he can
run, but there will be somebody
ahead of him and he will have
plenty of opportunity to stretch out.
The last leg, the mile run, should
shed some light on the question of
who is the Coast's distance champ
for 1935. All the Stanford money
will go on Norm Bright, but Cap
tain-elect Bob Fowler of California, 1
not yet beaten in the two-mile dur
ing two seasons of running on the
Coast, has plenty of backers and
can cut loose with a last lap that
few can match. Also, little Benny
Benavidez of the Trojans can't be
counted out; his mile in the U.S.C.-
Cal meet is still the best California
college mark of the season.

TAKE A LOOK
AT MEL HURLEY

While keeping a weather eye out
for stray high school stars as future
material for Stanford track teams,
the Farm fans Saturday night will
not be disappointed if they glance at
the discus circle and watch a Stan
ford sophomore in his first compe
tition of the year and wearing not a
Stanford but an Olympic Club em
blem.
Mel Hurley shyed out of com
petition this season in order to
save his eligibility, but he has not
neglected the discus tossing which
made him a valuable member of
last year's frosh team, despite a
bad knee which kept him from
getting the usual whip behind the
platter. This spring he's worked
ou< with Phil Levy, Jack King, Al
Hershey, and the other Stanford

weight men, and his consistency
between the 140- and 150-foot
marks' labels him ns a point win
ner for the few years to come.
Saturday night will be his first
big' competition, and despite the
presence of Bob Jones, Here La-
Borde, Glen Randell, Levy, King,
John Lyman, et al., his ample frame
may get behind a throw that will
land in the money.

MEDLEY RELAY
WON'T DISAPPOINT

I 'Saturday Fresno continues its tra
i edition of presenting the classic of
! California track festivals. At the
■ Fresno Relays the spring appetites
! of the local athletic enthusiasts have
! their fill. There'll be competition
I from early morning till way after
' the lights go on. California's great
! est college and club athletes will be
■ there, apd a host of prep school aces
i for the scouts to watch.
One race that will stand plenty
! of ballyhoo is the medley relay.
\ It will be a combination of a
i Blackmail - LuValle - McCarthy
i quarter, a Nimmo - Brace - Bush
i half mile, a Heavy-March-Wall
three laps, and a Bright-Fowler
! Dixon-Benavidez mile, which is
i some order. The four favorites,
j U.S.C., Stanford, California, and
j the Olympic Club have their ace
runners so staggered that a see
saw battle is almost sure to re
sult.
The Trojans should have a lead
after McCarthy runs the quarter and
Bush the half. But Zamperini, the
Trojan third man, is not so strong,
and Stanford with March, California
' with Bob Heavey, and the Club with
j Johnny Wall are sure to close the
j gap. March proved to himself last
! Saturday that he is faster than
| Zamperini when he finished with a
sprint that would have caught the
Trojan had the race been 20 yards
longer. Wall, a really great runner,
trailed Bright in his 4:17 mile two
weeks ago and is at home in the best
company. Heavey, the critics say,
doesn't know yet how fast he can
run, but there will be somebody
ahead of him and he will have
plenty of opportunity to stretch out.
The last leg, the mile run, should
shed some light on the question of
who is the Coast's distance champ
for 1935. All the Stanford money
will go on Norm Bright, but Cap
tain-elect Bob Fowler of California, 1
not yet beaten in the two-mile dur
ing two seasons of running on the
Coast, has plenty of backers and
can cut loose with a last lap that
few can match. Also, little Benny
Benavidez of the Trojans can't be
counted out; his mile in the U.S.C.-
Cal meet is still the best California
college mark of the season.
