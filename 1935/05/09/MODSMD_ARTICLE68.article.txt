### 
Having defeated the Trojan polo-
Lsts here last week 7-4, the redshirt

peat their victory in a return en
counter against the strong U.S.C.
outfit.
I'lay Saturday
The second game against Troy will
be played on Saturday afternoon,
according to Lieut. H. Y. Grubbs'
plans. The Indians will have a tough
job on their hands in subduing the
powerful Trojans in their own baili—
%vick. S.C. will furnish mounts for
Stanford's quartet so the situation of
being forced to play on strange pon
ies and on a foreign field will be
reversed from last week with the
Trojans possessing the advantage in
stead of the Cards.
The Trojans last Friday were
leading the favored Cards as the
fifth chukker opened, 4 to 3, and the
Indians were forced to turn on the
heat in the final two periods to put
the game on ice.
Lieut. Grubbs announced the
players who will accompany him
South as Captain Bill Rogers, Carl
Beal, Bob Fullerton, Russ Rasmus
sen, Bill Enemark, and Jim Hender
son. Despite the fact that he is mak
ing the trip, Rasmussen, regular No.
3, will probably not see service be
cause of an injured knee. With him
out the same line-up that faced Troy
last week will ride against S.C. Sat
urday. This quartet consists of Bill
Enemark at 1, Bill Rogers at No. 2,
Carl Beal at 3, and Bob Fullerton in
No. 4 position.
Schedule O.S.C.
The Trojan line-up will probably
consist of George Berkley, Captain
Don Spiers, Bob Shaw, and Chuck
Wheeler.
After the U.S.C. game Saturday the
redshirts have a contest scheduled
against a visiting Oregon State outfit
on Friday, May 17. The postponed
California game has been -tentatively
set for next Monday, May 13. A
prospective encounter with Will
Tevis's strong San Mateo four will
wind up the Stanford season, Lieut.
Grubbs said.
Del Monte this year and has made
many of the foremost amateurs in
the Bay region plenty anxious in the
various tournaments in which he has
played lately.
