# Thornhill Slates Tough Sessions For Grid Teams
## Laterals Used Extensively By Indians in Early Season Practice Newer Formations, Passes Still Being Stressed 
### 
11 Tiny Thornhill carries out his
plans of yesterday afternoon, Stan
ford's splint; football men are going
to be calling their coach "Simon
Leg roe II" along about 5:30 o'clock
this evening. Tiny says he's all set
to put his 80 grid aspirants through
a scrimmage session that will be
"plenty tough."
Last night Thornhill ran his squad
through a pass drill, then wound up
the day with sigpal practice and
some light bloekfng and tackling.
Today's workout will finish the
week for footballers.
Characteristic of early season
passing is the extensive use of lat
erals on the Card practice field.
Nearly every pass play on the In
dian list to date calls for at least one
lateral, in some cases two, and Tiny
has designed his plays in such a way
that the lateral may, or may not,
be thrown depending upon the posi
tion of the receiver.
As the season progresses the Card
coach will limit the use of laterals
somewhat, but for early season pass
catching practice he finds them a
valuable asset.
Every time Tiny turns around
these days someone accosts him
with the well-worn query "How's
the team lining up. Tiny?" and
Thornhill's regular answer is, "I've
gotta teach 'em the plays before I
can know."
The first string, with their knowl
edge of last season's plays, is the
only squad that really has the for
mations learned and little doubt re
mains as to how this team lines up.
The only two differences yester
day were the temporary absences of
Bones Hamilton and Johnny Reis
ner from the halfback posts. Fred
Williams was running in Hamilton's
place. Joe Vigna in Reisner's job.
Johnny has been ordered off the
field for the past few days to give
a broken blood vessel in his loot
a chance to heal.
