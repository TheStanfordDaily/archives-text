# CHAPPIE 'LOVE' ISSUE ON SALE
## Sketch by Ollie Johnson Featured on Cover 
### 
What is "love" and whom the
Stanford women consider the "love
liest." co-eds are revealed this morn
ing as the May issue of Chaparral
goes on sale. For a syllabus fee of
16 cents campus lovers may learn of
the humor they may have over
looked by being too serious about it
all.
Most unusual and striking cover
in many Chappie years graces the
"Love" number. A portrait of the
head of a beautiful girl done in char
coal by Oilie Johnston,'former Chap
pie artist and present member of the
Walt Disney staff, is the cover de
sign—the composite picture of all
Stanford's lovely women.
More art work than has ever be
fore appeared in one issue is fea
tured in the new Chappie. The use
of photolithography has made pos
sible the presenting of cartoons by
Dorman Smith, Dick Dawson, Gil
man Gist, Kodell Johnson, Jack
Boyd, and many other contributors.
For those who consider themselves
lovers of no mean ability, a love
questionnaire has been drawn up by
Dick Dawson. Those scoring above
$113 will get iheir money's worth out
of Chappie. John Kline contributes
an article on "How To Fall in Love
with a Stanford Woman" should the
readers be so inclined. There are
fables as usual—but concerning un
usual women and unusual love
scenes.
"All the world loves a lover" and
all the campus will love the LOVE
Number—so Editor Steedman's
warning is: get your copy early if
you don't want your "Love Locked
Out" by the threatened sell-out.
