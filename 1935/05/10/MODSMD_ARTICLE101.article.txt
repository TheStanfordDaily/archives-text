# Matanuska Pioneer Trek Nears Promised Land
## 
### 
SEWARD, Alaska, May 9 (/P). â€”
The Matanuska pioneers today drew
I near the end of their long trek from
Minnesota to a new land of prom
: ise.
By tomorrow night they will be
I "tenting" in the Matanuska valley
j where the government has "staked"
' them in the hope they may again
; achieve the independence they lost
I when they were forced to go on
| relief rolls.
I In the old days it was mostly men
| who flocked here but women and
, children far outnumbered the men
j in the band of colonists.
j It was a 150-mile trip over the
government-owned Alaska Railroad
i to the valley.
