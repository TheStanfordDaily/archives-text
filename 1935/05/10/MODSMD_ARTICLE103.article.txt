# TRAVELS OF A STANFORD ROUGH
## 
### GRANT LEIBERT 
The invigorating tang of the fresh |
breeze blowing in from the Gulf of
Lower California put me in exceed
ingly good humor after the hot, dusty
trip across the desert wastes. You
can have your mountain cabins and j
your natural cactus gardens; give I
me the seashore where the wind
, doth blow and the pounding of the
breakers lulls one to sleep.
I'll put Mazatlan up against any
, beach resort anywhere in the world. |
; But whom could I find to risk a
wager? Certainly no one who has
! over seen that cozy little harbor, i
I sprinkled with palm-covered islands
j to which the Johnny Hotbloods '
bring their maidens on picnics,
moonlight swimming parties, and
; "island dances," would be lack
i witted enough to bet even the most |
i insignificant stake.
Only 100 years old, it has tried i
hard to be a modern ci;y. Thank
: fully, it overlooked one important
point: its streets are as crooked and |
! aimless as any you can find in the :
| ancient Indian villages. So you can 1
i enjoy a hot tub, v/ell prepared food, ,
modern sanitation, first class hotels, i
1 casinos, and department stores with- i
' out sacrificing the "quaintness" and
'"romance" which are always con
! nected with crooked alleyways.
For its single century of existence j
Mazatlan has had plenty of excite- j
ment. Whenever there is a revolu
[ tion, the race is on to see who can j
take this seaport town. The inimical !
portion of the Navy teams into the j
harbor and lets loose a few broad
j sides, to which the city guns reply.
| Both sides conserve their ammuni
i tion with extreme care, for if they
didn't, they wouldn't have any left
| to start the next uprising. Conse
j quently, the city has suffered very
, little actual damage from the nu
' merous bombardments it has re
| ceived.
The citizens don't even halt busi
ness any more during time of war;
however, the statistics show that the
number of hits registered within the
city limits (including the neighbor
ing islands also) has increased 7 per
j cent during the last six revolutions.
| The inhabitants would then do well
to exercise more care, in view of the
, increased efficiency on the part of
| the Navy.
"I believe, sir, that I have the
| honor of addressing a citizen of the
United States of America," said a
full, resonant voice at my elbow.
I turned my gaze from the sea to
an elderly gentleman, of pale com
plexion, dressed in a shiny dark suit
and wearing gloves, the worn fin
gers of which revealed human flesh.
"True," I replied. "Well, sir," he
continued, hooking his cane on his
I left arm, "if you will be so kind as

to grant me your indulgence for a
few seconds, I shall reveal to you a
story which may prove to be of in
calculable value to one now in the
bloom of his manhood."
I must have nodded affirmatively,
for he went on: "You observe in me
one who was gifted beyond his years
with histrionic talent; one who
reaped his fortune, I am sad to say, I
much too early in life. Before I was
out of my early- twenties, I was a !
man of affluence, respected and, I 1
suppose, envied, in the world of the
theater. I retired, poor fool that 11
was, and started, as I called it, to j
live life. In the words of the play- |
wright, 'I lived, laughed, loved, |
lusted, and—lost.'
'"My last desperate effort to regain
a vestige of the glory and fortune
that once were mine has met with
the disapproval of the local resi
dents; and I am reduced to abject
penury. In brief, sir, I, who have

appeared for the fifth curtain call
before the Queen's box in London,
am asking you for succor. Just a
single meal, that is all I importune."
How can a man turn a deaf ear to
royalty? So, naturally I complied
with the wish of H.R.H. The Prince
of Panhandlers, if I ever hope to see

him. "Ah, sir, the leading lady, she
too ..." Again I crossed his palm,
and departed, feeling the self-satis
fied patron of arts.

The invigorating tang of the fresh |
breeze blowing in from the Gulf of
Lower California put me in exceed
ingly good humor after the hot, dusty
trip across the desert wastes. You
can have your mountain cabins and j
your natural cactus gardens; give I
me the seashore where the wind
, doth blow and the pounding of the
breakers lulls one to sleep.
I'll put Mazatlan up against any
, beach resort anywhere in the world. |
; But whom could I find to risk a
wager? Certainly no one who has
! over seen that cozy little harbor, i
I sprinkled with palm-covered islands
j to which the Johnny Hotbloods '
bring their maidens on picnics,
moonlight swimming parties, and
; "island dances," would be lack
i witted enough to bet even the most |
i insignificant stake.
Only 100 years old, it has tried i
hard to be a modern ci;y. Thank
: fully, it overlooked one important
point: its streets are as crooked and |
! aimless as any you can find in the :
| ancient Indian villages. So you can 1
i enjoy a hot tub, v/ell prepared food, ,
modern sanitation, first class hotels, i
1 casinos, and department stores with- i
' out sacrificing the "quaintness" and
'"romance" which are always con
! nected with crooked alleyways.
For its single century of existence j
Mazatlan has had plenty of excite- j
ment. Whenever there is a revolu
[ tion, the race is on to see who can j
take this seaport town. The inimical !
portion of the Navy teams into the j
harbor and lets loose a few broad
j sides, to which the city guns reply.
| Both sides conserve their ammuni
i tion with extreme care, for if they
didn't, they wouldn't have any left
| to start the next uprising. Conse
j quently, the city has suffered very
, little actual damage from the nu
' merous bombardments it has re
| ceived.
The citizens don't even halt busi
ness any more during time of war;
however, the statistics show that the
number of hits registered within the
city limits (including the neighbor
ing islands also) has increased 7 per
j cent during the last six revolutions.
| The inhabitants would then do well
to exercise more care, in view of the
, increased efficiency on the part of
| the Navy.
"I believe, sir, that I have the
| honor of addressing a citizen of the
United States of America," said a
full, resonant voice at my elbow.
I turned my gaze from the sea to
an elderly gentleman, of pale com
plexion, dressed in a shiny dark suit
and wearing gloves, the worn fin
gers of which revealed human flesh.
"True," I replied. "Well, sir," he
continued, hooking his cane on his
I left arm, "if you will be so kind as

to grant me your indulgence for a
few seconds, I shall reveal to you a
story which may prove to be of in
calculable value to one now in the
bloom of his manhood."
I must have nodded affirmatively,
for he went on: "You observe in me
one who was gifted beyond his years
with histrionic talent; one who
reaped his fortune, I am sad to say, I
much too early in life. Before I was
out of my early- twenties, I was a !
man of affluence, respected and, I 1
suppose, envied, in the world of the
theater. I retired, poor fool that 11
was, and started, as I called it, to j
live life. In the words of the play- |
wright, 'I lived, laughed, loved, |
lusted, and—lost.'
'"My last desperate effort to regain
a vestige of the glory and fortune
that once were mine has met with
the disapproval of the local resi
dents; and I am reduced to abject
penury. In brief, sir, I, who have

appeared for the fifth curtain call
before the Queen's box in London,
am asking you for succor. Just a
single meal, that is all I importune."
