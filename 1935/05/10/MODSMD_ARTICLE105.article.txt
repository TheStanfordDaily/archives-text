William Kuzell and William
Mingst, two Stanford sophomores
who are at present spending a year
at Lingnan University in Canton,
China, on a partial scholarship basis,
have written about an extended
trip they took through the interior
of turbulent China.
Starting southward from Canton,
they pushed southward along the
coast 500 miles, and then swung
sharply northward into the province
of Kwangsi, nearly 400 miles to
Liuchow, a large city in a remote
part of China. From there they went
westward to the Kwei river, down
which they went in sampans by slow
stages until they finally arrived at
Lingnan once more.
The (rip covered thousands of
miles, and v\as one of the educa
tive features of die year in the
Chinese institution.
A similar opportunity for several
Stanford students to spend a year
in Lingnan University in the near
future will open up, and those
interested may communicate with
Thomas LaFargue, room 172, Ad
ministration Building.
