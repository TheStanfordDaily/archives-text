# Propaganda Reflected In Slavic Arty Says Professor

### 
Large numbers of Stanford stu
dents and faculty attended the re
cently concluded Carnegie inter
national exhibit of modern art at
the Veterans Memorial in San Fran
cisco.
Dr. Kurt F. Reinhardt in com
menting upon this exhibit calls at
tention to the fact that it is a de
parture from the traditional art dis
play in having more than 315 paint
ings, modern only, from thirteen
nations.
The professor observes that Rus
sian art, as typified in the works of
Alexandre Deineka, "The Para
chute Jumper" and "Girl on Bal
cony," reflect, propaganda-like, the
new ideals which the Russians arc
endeavoring to inculcate in their
citizens: making the public "air
minded" and glorifying physical vi
tality.
Boili America and Russia do not
consider art as an end in itself, but
rather as a striking way of relating
life and reality.
An American painting by Peter
Blume called "South of Scranton"
was awarded the first prize of $1,500.
Dr. Reinh; rdt points out that Amer
ica has not yci been able to establish
an art tradition of its own, and has

been thriving on inherited art from
Europe.
The process of economic and in
tellectual unrest of the present is
permeating American life so deeply
that the artist is gradually finding
expression in his art for everyday
problems, and United States is rap
idly on the way to achieving inde
pendence in art, Dr. Rcinhardt con
cludes.
