# Reading To Substitute For Tuesday Lecture
## 
### 
A dramatic reading of "The Petri
fied Forest" by Robert Sherwood
will be given by Mrs. Hugh Brown
next Tuesday evening in the Assem
bly Hall at 7:30 o'clock.
Mrs. Brown, who is known in the
community for her drama interpre
tations, has given a number of read
ings on the campus in the past. The
play, which had a long run in New
York this season, while it Â«s melo
dramatic in form is an extremely
thoughtful attempt on the part of
the dramatist to symbolize present
day psychology.
Leslie Howard played the role of
Alan Squier, an intellectual, in the
New York production.
