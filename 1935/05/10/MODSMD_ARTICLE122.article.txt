# Naval Planes Start Flight Over Pacific
## Fleet Faces Battle Against Storm Conditions 
### 
HONOLULU, May 9 (/P). — The
American navy's secret move to span
a trackless stretch of midpacific
with an unprecedented 46-plane
mass flight from Honolulu to Mid
way Island got under way here to
day and almost immediately faced
the prospect of battling storm con
ditions at sea.
Storm Blowing
Soon after the planes had
off here in a spectacular formation
maneuver, J. F. Voorhees, Govern
ment meteorologist, said heavy rain
was falling and a 24-mile wind
blowing at Midway Island, 1323
miles distant.
Voorhees said there was a possi
bility of increasing storminess in the
area. He suggested the air armada,
greatest of its kind ever assembled,
could stop at French Frigate shoals,
500 miles northwest of here, or at
Pearl and Hermes reef, 100 miles
short of the air fleet's destination.
Plan Followed
Flight officers had noted the pos
sibility of a storm in the area of
Midway before Ihe takeoff, however,
ax»d apparently considered no
change of plans, which presumably
called for no intermediate; stops.
It took one minute less than Iw:j
hours fur the heavily loaded air
craft, bearing some 200 officers and
men, to get into the air one by one.
Then, like ships of the fleet, the
powerful planes lined up in squad
rons and streaked away on a hith
erto unblazed trail.
