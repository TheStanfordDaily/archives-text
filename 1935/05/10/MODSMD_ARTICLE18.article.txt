# Adult Summer Session To Be Held at Berkeley
## 
### JOHN McCLELLAND 
Imagine such a college as this: i
Three .score students between the
ages of 17 and 60; their political
leanings Communistic, Socialistic,
Democratic, Republican, or Amer
ican Worker; their religions Cath- !
olic, Protestant, or Jewish; their vo- I
! cations ranging from brick laying to ;
jewel polishing; representing at least
10 labor unions. And this group, I
taught by half a dozen college pro- !
lessors, going to college fcr a month.
Such a set-up will constitute the
Western Summer School for Work
i ers which will be held at the Uni
| versity of California this .summer,
| and to which one or more Stanford
students will be sent to live and
study along with the labor group.
Held Each Summer
As a part of California's adult cdu- |
tat ion program, the Workers School
is held each summer. Most of tho«e
who attend are not even high school
graduates. They are given courses
in labor economics and history. Eng
lish, art, drama, and music. The
sprinkling of college students who
attend get their education mainly
from the workers themselves, who
represent practically every belief
and creed.

! LaM summer Stanford was repre
sented by Jo Schlatter al the session
held at Occidental.
Radicals in Group
; "Those of us from colleges lived
right the workers, worked with
! them, and attended their union
[meetings with them," Miss Schlatter
j said in telling of her experience,
i "From the opening of the sessions
j to the end, one long, heated diseus
i sion took place. And a lot of rad
icals needed toning down. Those
people's beliefs weren't based on
j theories, but on actual experience
and practice. They are the kind of
people we study about in college.''
A committee appointed by Dean
Mary Yost will select the represen
| tative who will go from Stanford
this year. The cost to send one
woman representative, $40, will be
provided by a scholarship furnished
by women's living groups. At pres
ent no plans have been made by the
committee to send a man. although
.such a plan would be acccptablc if a
sponsor could be found. Applica
tions for individuals wishing to at
tend the school are available at the
Dean of Women's office.

[meetings with them," Miss Schlatter

i "From the opening of the sessions

people's beliefs weren't based on

A committee appointed by Dean
Mary Yost will select the represen
| tative who will go from Stanford
this year. The cost to send one
woman representative, $40, will be
provided by a scholarship furnished
by women's living groups. At pres
ent no plans have been made by the
committee to send a man. although
.such a plan would be acccptablc if a
sponsor could be found. Applica
tions for individuals wishing to at
tend the school are available at the
Dean of Women's office.
Imagine such a college as this: i
Three .score students between the
ages of 17 and 60; their political
leanings Communistic, Socialistic,
Democratic, Republican, or Amer
ican Worker; their religions Cath- !
olic, Protestant, or Jewish; their vo- I
! cations ranging from brick laying to ;
jewel polishing; representing at least
10 labor unions. And this group, I
taught by half a dozen college pro- !
lessors, going to college fcr a month.
Such a set-up will constitute the
Western Summer School for Work
i ers which will be held at the Uni
| versity of California this .summer,
| and to which one or more Stanford
students will be sent to live and
study along with the labor group.
Held Each Summer
As a part of California's adult cdu- |
tat ion program, the Workers School
is held each summer. Most of tho«e
who attend are not even high school
graduates. They are given courses
in labor economics and history. Eng
lish, art, drama, and music. The
sprinkling of college students who
attend get their education mainly
from the workers themselves, who
represent practically every belief
and creed.
