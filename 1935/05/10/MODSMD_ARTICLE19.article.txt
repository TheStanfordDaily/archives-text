# WORDS ELY AS GOVERNMENTAL PROBLEMS HIT
## Wilbur Begins Discussion With Outline of Student Control of Farm 
### 
Verbal jousting ran high in the
Little Theater last night as students
and faculty members alike, partici
pating in a semi-panel discussion on
problems of student government, |
struck out against a host of contro- j
versial issues.
Many were the brief debates that
followed Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur's
presentation of the history of stu
dent control at Stanford and his own I
philosophy of an effective student
government. On the stage included
in v/hat might be called a panel
group were Dean Mary Yost, MLss !
Louise Price, Marion Storey, Dr. !
C. Gilbert Wrenn, Dr. H. C. Hand, !
Kenneth Livingston, Dave Mellin

Kahn, acting as chairman. It was j
they, who from the close of Dr. )
Wilbur's talk, kept things popping
for the remainder of the evening j
with their questioning and comment
pertinent to the particular problem
at hand.
Wilbur Chief Speaker
Dr. Wilbur as the chief speaker j
depicted the almost chaotic condi

of a student governing body at Stan- i
ford, pointing out as he continued
the constantly increasing functions
that grew into student control as
time went on. Student interest in
such a government, he said, became j
more noticeable, a greater degree of
representation was attained, with
the result that the system of govern
ment came to be "a good deal bet
ter than in most communities of the
outer world." In concluding, how
ever, he definitely showed that in
terest is on the wane and that the
number actually interested in stu
dent. affairs and showing willing
ness to accept responsibility was far
too small for maximum efficiency of
the system.
Dean Yost, commenting first
among the panel members, agreed
wholly with Dr. Wilbur's conclud
ing statement. A high point in the
proceedings was reached when Dr.
Hand requested Bull Sessionist
Mellinkoff to explain his stand taken
in his daily column that student
government should be abolished.
Mellinkoff quickly retorted that po
. litical machinery and undue empha

i ing bodies defeated the purpose of
