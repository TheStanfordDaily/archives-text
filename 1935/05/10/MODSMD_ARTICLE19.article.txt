# WORDS ELY AS GOVERNMENTAL PROBLEMS HIT
## Wilbur Begins Discussion With Outline of Student Control of Farm 
### 
Verbal jousting ran high in the
Little Theater last night as students
and faculty members alike, partici
pating in a semi-panel discussion on
problems of student government, |
struck out against a host of contro- j
versial issues.
Many were the brief debates that
followed Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur's
presentation of the history of stu
dent control at Stanford and his own I
philosophy of an effective student
government. On the stage included
in v/hat might be called a panel
group were Dean Mary Yost, MLss !
Louise Price, Marion Storey, Dr. !
C. Gilbert Wrenn, Dr. H. C. Hand, !
Kenneth Livingston, Dave Mellin
koff, and A.S.S.U. President Marvie !
Kahn, acting as chairman. It was j
they, who from the close of Dr. )
Wilbur's talk, kept things popping
for the remainder of the evening j
with their questioning and comment
pertinent to the particular problem
at hand.
Wilbur Chief Speaker
Dr. Wilbur as the chief speaker j
depicted the almost chaotic condi
tions existing prior to the institution
of a student governing body at Stan- i
ford, pointing out as he continued
the constantly increasing functions
that grew into student control as
time went on. Student interest in
such a government, he said, became j
more noticeable, a greater degree of
representation was attained, with
the result that the system of govern
ment came to be "a good deal bet
ter than in most communities of the
outer world." In concluding, how
ever, he definitely showed that in
terest is on the wane and that the
number actually interested in stu
dent. affairs and showing willing
ness to accept responsibility was far
too small for maximum efficiency of
the system.
Dean Yost, commenting first
among the panel members, agreed
wholly with Dr. Wilbur's conclud
ing statement. A high point in the
proceedings was reached when Dr.
Hand requested Bull Sessionist
Mellinkoff to explain his stand taken
in his daily column that student
government should be abolished.
Mellinkoff quickly retorted that po
. litical machinery and undue empha
| sis upon pictty duties of the govern
i ing bodies defeated the purpose of
student government with the result
that it was distinctly bad training
for the students concerned. It was
here that Mellinkoff grasped the
bone of contention in a matter
which was not soon to be settled.
Dr. Hand, Dr. Wilbur, Dean Yost,
Miss Price, Livingston, and Dr.
Wienn were united in the viewpoint
that Mellinkoff had overestimated
the strength of the so-called polit
ical machine, that the matters with
which Ex Committee is concerned
are anything but petty, and that ihe
solving of problematic details in
government was of the greatest
value and use, anyhow.
Varied Issues Hit
Frank Fullenwider, Bill Rogers,
Bob Gros, John Kline, Phil Bern
neim, and others of the audience
then joined into the festivities,
bringing before the spotlight in rapid
order such issues as university tra
ditions and their value, social con
duct on the campus, effectiveness of
the Honor Code, and even whether
or not grade averages should be pub
lished in the bawlout. The session
soon resolved itself into a succession
of heated debates with each of the
matters finding more than ample
support both pro and con before ihe
meeting was adjourned.
Drawing the confab to a close,
Kahn extended an invitation to the
entire audience to attend the Pi
Lambda Theta panel discussion on
student-faculty relations to be con
ducted in the Women's Clubhouse
Wednesday evening at 7:30 o'clock.
Plans for subsequent sessions, simi
lar to last night's, are already under
way, he added.
Gold mining is to be carried on
extensively in Manchukuo.
