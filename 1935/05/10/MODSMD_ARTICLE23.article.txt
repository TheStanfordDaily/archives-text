# England in Race To Beat German Plane Expansion
## Parliament Cites Adoption Of Triple Air Policy For Great Britain Powerful Nazi Armaments Viewed as Menace 
### 
LONDON, May 9 (A*).—Britain of
ficially "took off" today in a grim •
race to match Germany's expansion
of air forces, disclosed by Hitler's 1
recent defiant statement '"we already ;
have as many planes as England."
Shox*tly after King George sounded
a strong note for peace before Par
liament, assembled to historic West
minster Hall to pay him jubilee
homage, a threefold government ac- :
tion was revealed. Emphasizing the
seriousness with which menace of a
powerfully armed Germany is re
garded, these steps were:
Ban Foreign Orders
1. The Air Ministry issued strict i
orders forbidding aircraft and air-1
plane engine manufacturers to ac- 1
cept foreign orders and at the same !
time urged immediate speeding up j
of production with the assurance a
huge expansion program for the
Royal Air Force would keep their I
works running full force for at least!
two years.
2. It was learned the government
intends extensive measures to edu
cate the public against perils of air
attack, probably with compulsory I
air raid drills throughout the na- ,
tion.
Defense Bill Hurried
3. Now the jubilee holiday is over, j
members of the Cabinet are under- j
stood to be speeding a program of
defense measures which will be pre- ;
sented to the House of Commons
May 22.
The Air Ministry communication j
spurring manufacturers to acceler- 1
ate production leaked out despite in
junction that it be kept strictly con- ,
fidential.
An official of a leading aircraft.
firm said "the Air Ministry asked
what maximum output could be se- '
cured and inferred that for a con
siderable period ahead sufficient
orders will be available to keep the
works at full pressure. This applies
to military aircraft and refers to a !
period of at least two years."
Compulsory Drills
Compulsory air raid drills, it was i
understood, will be modeled on Ber- !
lin's "bomb attack rehearsal." In'
addition to camouflage measures, j
civilians will be taught use of gas;
masks. The program will be offi
cially directed, as the government
has decided the task is top important >
to leave in the hands of voluntary !
bodie;; an in the past.
