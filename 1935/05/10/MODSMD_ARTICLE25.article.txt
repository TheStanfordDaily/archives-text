PASADENA, May f/P).â€”Henry j
Ellsworth Vines, Jr., home from the
professional tennis ways, took a '
squint at the Davis Cup picture to- ; '
day and decided the United Slates j 1
team would have a tough time get- *
ting past Australia in its quest for
the international trophy held by
England.
"The United States team," said
Vines, Los Angeles's singles cham
pion, "has just about an even chance
to defeat the Australians and should
it do this the prospects of it beating
the British are exceedingly remote."
