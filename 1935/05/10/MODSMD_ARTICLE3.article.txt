# Cards To Enter Relays Without Aid of Blackman
## Dink Undecided on Entries; Card Showing Depends On Special Events Weights, Hurdles Big Hope For Points 
### Gordon Frost 
There's been a haze of discourage- !
i ment hanging over Angell Field for
J the past week, and last night that |
j haze dropped right down on the |
track. Hard and cold came the an- j
nouncement from team physician t
i Fritz Roth's office that Captain A1 j
Blackman should do no running for |
j two weeks; that his cramped muscle i
i should have no more strain of gruel- i
i ing finishes.
The word came as a complete |
'■ surprise to Dink Templeton, and last
j night he was still uncertain about j
i his relay entries in the Fresno Re-
J lays at the Raisin City tonight and j
i tomorrow afternoon and evening.
Blackman was to have run the
| anchor lap of the mile relay as well j
! as the 440 of the medley event, and j
j Dink refused to comment, even to |
tell his own team, whether Al's job
! in the medley would be replaced by J
another 440 man and whether the j
j mile relay team would go south at 1
!alh
Dink Silent
Dink's only word to the little
; group of 440 and medley relay team
members who waited anxiously for
I the "yes" that would assure them of I
i a chance to compete at Fresno, de- j
] spite the loss of their captain, was I
I "I'll have to let you know in the I
j morning."
Meanwhile Blackman himself had |
a few words to say. "I've already j
1 run three i - aces on this leg, can't 11
make a stab at these two, Dink?" but
I Templeton could only reply that
I doctor's orders were doctor's orders. I
However there is still some chance I
J that physician Roth will waive his
! order if he feels that Blackman's
| competing would do the cramped j
J muscle no permanent harm. This j
might be one reason Dink hesitated j
|to make any declaration last night. (
Loss Felt Less .
The bright side of the situation i
appears when it is brought to mind j
that. Stanford's changes with or j
I without Blackman are mighty slim, |
and the loss of the captain is felt j
less at this time than at any other, j
Dink was quite positive that he i
( would still enter his sprint relay i
team along with a handful of indi- S
vidual competitors. Four of these
individuals appear as Stanford's
most likely point gainers, since all
the tard relay fours will look com- !
paratively weak in the strenuous i
competition at Fresno.
Sammy Klopstock tops the list;
his performance in the high hurdles
will stand high in any field, and
Indian hopes are that Sam will,
cleave the tape after the final hurdle
flight, despite the fact that he faces
one of the best gatherings of high
hurdlers on the coast.
Mottram Likely Winner
Johnny Mottram is another Stan
fordite who should come out on top. '
Mottram has no easy job on his 1
hands with Ed Waterbury of the
Flying "O" team and Norman Fitz
gerald who would like to beat John
ny for the second time.
Phil Levy should also tack his,
name in the point-winning column.
Levy will go up against Olympic
Club's tough lot of discus men,
Slinger Dunn, Here Laßorde, and
Eobby Jones. Then there'll be Glenn !
Randeil of Cal and Ken Carpenter
from the Trojan gang.
Jim Reynolds has a good chance to
stay abreast the shot put field, as has
A1 Hershey, but both will need super
efforts to snatch points out of the :
Fresno field.
