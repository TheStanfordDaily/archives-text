# Hall and Row; Why the Sudden Political Outburst?
## 
### 
(iraduate versus undergraduate How ver
sus Hall. The two phrases seem to be entirely
disassociated. Then why the tie-up within the J
hist few days?
Tile answer is simple. Because campus ;
would-be politicians have been set free among 1
Ihe new mown hay fields, neighboring beer j
taverns, and eating club kitchens. With a
ulew in in tliei r eve and a concent rid ion enti rely i
* . •
lacking in classrooms, they ferret around tor
some unhappy victim lo "talk over the sitna-
I ion."
II is a curious thing. For eight and a hall
months the student body goes around with an
idealistic philosophy which amounts to: "We
are advanced here at Stanford. There is no
fraternity-dormitory competition. We are ;
erasing the bond between llall and How."
And then for the other two or three weeks,
the students spend their time disproving !
what they have been claiming all year.
What is the scream? Whether a grad
uate is entitled to hold office in the student
body. And because one clique fears that
another may get one step ahead, it uses this
age-worn question as a ramrod lo stir up a
messy situation.
II you divorce the feud from politics and
look at the situation logically, there is no
doubt that restricting an office from a man
merely because he is a graduate is absurd. 1
Men are not judged by their year in school. !
They are presumably judged by their ability. j
II is like keeping a wonderful football player
on I lie bench because he is a sophomore, while
Ihe feeble senior who is out on the field be
cause he is a senior lets the tackle through |
every time.
Should a partisan group, whipped up for
Ibis occasion by a group of amateur ward
heelers, go out and succeed in putting through
this amendment next Tuesday, the results
will affect the present position of graduate
students in the administration. For this
reason alone the amendment is dangerous
and should be downed. And because it raises
an artificial distinction between senior and
graduate it deserves no place in a supposedly
democratic t'ni versitv.
