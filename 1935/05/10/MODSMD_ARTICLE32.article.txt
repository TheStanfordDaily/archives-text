# Campus Needs Succor-From Mosquitos
## 
### 
To the Daily's request that some definite
steps be taken to save Stanford from the
mosquitos, the Administration in reply says
that the insect difficulty reaches beyond the
[lowers of the University's control.
The growing hordes of mosquitos, mean
while, carry on their daily foraging parties
over the campus. The number of wounded
mounts with the passing of time and the
gradual isolation of swampy land surround
ing the Farm.
The comparatively few numbers of insects
that now haunt the local regions are nothing
compared with the expected squadrons, along
with their attending gnat shock troops, that
will gradually move in toward the end of the
Hut the t'niversity, with all its scientists of
note, claims that flic little but potent mos
quitos breed in hide-outs too numerous and
hidden to be effectively fought. Vet those same
scientists and health experts can combat
germs much more minute in size and much
more abundant in numbers.
Kvery year these hordes infest the Farm.
It is ;i wonder that a mosquito abatement ex
pert could not be found or developed among
the personnel of a faculty of noted personages,
who could hunt the attackers to their hide
outs and properly destroy them before they
inflict their yearly damage toll on Stanforditcs.
