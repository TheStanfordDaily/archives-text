# Tsk Tsk! Chappie and Daily

NOW THAT man's here again; the Old J Joy
bursts editorially forth from his lair with a
horrible vengeance in his eye, sparks sparking
from the proverbial hammer, and slinks softly
along the trial of the much-maligned Daii.v.
Poor Daily.
It's the old traffic fine nrt'ss; the Venerable
(loop's ire arose at one of the Daily's edi
torials which supported, mind you, his very
stand on the matter. Prompted by a per
fectly helpful motive in trying to explain the
injustice of the situation which caused the
Ancient One himself to be fined, the Daily
timidly hoped it could be of aid, in its very
small way.
Thankless job, hey?
