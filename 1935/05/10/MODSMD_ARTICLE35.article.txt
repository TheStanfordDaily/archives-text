THE AAA ANI) TIIE DROUGHT: WHICH
DID THE WORK?
WASHINGTON, D.C., May 6. —Ever since the War
most of our farmers have had a pretty tough time.
"They felt the first jar caused by the enormous drop
in the sale of farm products along about 1920. Prices
fell as much as 75 per cent or more almost overnight.
Ever since then the eountry has had a real farm
problem in trying to handle the perpetual surpluses
ihe land put in use by the war continued to raise.
'I he boom of the late 'twenties meant little to the
farmers; things had been bad for them since 1920. The
rapid collapse of almost all prices starting in 1930
almost ruined them. When President Roosevelt took
office on that rainy day in March, 1933, the three most
pressing problems were: (1) get the banks open again;
(2) the farm problem; (3) relief for the unemployed.
F.R. proceeded to handle the agricultural situation
by having Congress create the AAA (Agricultural Ad
justment Administration). The basic idea of this plan
was to restore the purchasing power of the farmers as
rapidly as possible to the 1908-1913 level. It was gen
erally conceded any real recovery was impossible until
this was done. As a matter of fact, the low farm pur
chasing power of the 'twenties was suspected of being
one of the big causes of the 1929 collapse.
While the AAA was restoring buying power to
farmers, the NRA was supposed to do the same
thing for the consumers of their products—the in
dustrial workers. Together these two pillars of
recovery were expected to restore prosperity with
in a few jojs. Two years have already gone by.
Let's see what's happened. First, the methods of
AAA: then the results.
AAA'S METHODS
The only obvious way to adjust farm production to
demand was to cut production and try to work off the
piled-up surpluses. The AAA tried several ways of
doing this. One was to get the growers of certain things
to agree to cut their production in return for benefit
payments. Sometimes the AAA or its allied agencies
rented vacant land or land taken out of use at $1 an
acre per year and up. The cost of these payments
was to be carried by a processing tax on the manu
facturer of the farm product—the tax to yield enough
to raise farm buying power to the 1908-13 level on each
thing.
These processing taxes didn't cover all f-mn
products. Only cotton, hogs, corn, wheat, tobacco,
sugar, rice, and peanuts were included. The cattle
and sheep raisers decided to let the hog raisers
act as guinea pigs for the government experiment—
at least for the time being. Up to March 1 the
AAA had collected and given to the farmers
about 8630,000,000 in these benefit payments. Now
besides the money paid out. what have been the
results of AAA?
AAA'S RESULTS
The only way to measure results here is by the
increase in farm buying power and by the decrease
in the surpluses. Farm income rose from a low of
4*4 billion in 1932 to 5Vi billion in 1933 and 6 billion
last. year. Against that we have to place a rise of
nearly 20 per cent in the prices of things farmers buy.
So the average farmer is still little better off than he
was two years ago, in spite of the NRA and the drought.
The AAA benefits made up over a third of the in
creased farm income for the last two years. But we
have to remember this wasn't a real increase in farm
prices, but only a tax passed on to the consumer.
