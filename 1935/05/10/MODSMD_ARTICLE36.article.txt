our hasher regrets, he will be only able to lunge,
today, messieurs;
our hasher regrets he will be only able to lunge,
today, messieurs;
when it came to serve the coffee
he stuck in his hand and pulled out a plum and the
charred and mutilated body of the second boy.
which accounted for the color of the coffee but
not for our hasher's hand, which also became
charred and mutilated,
so, our hasher regrets he will only be able to lunge,
today, messieurs.
which all means that our hasher is only able to
lunge, today, messieurs, because of the fact that the
hand that is charred and macerated hand is the hand
which i am wont to make das kapitals, i must, perforce
be only able to lunge today, messieurs.
many peculiar people have often resented the fact
that i have bandied their personages and their follies
about in this disseminator of freedom, equality and
justice, and now i demonstrate intellectual courage in
tolling of my own goibled foibles, look for the wild
war veteran tomorrow with the wounded wing—he
may be our hasher.
i was waited upon by a delegation of the pi beta phi
phouse, who asked me to announce that a sophomore
had lost her binder in the library, when i said to them,
i said, that this was no lost and found column, they
said that it was a column dedicated to lost souls and
utterly unfounded on fact, i said to them ok., i said
i 11 see what i can do. so—
a sophomore has lost her soul, ya, ya.
any person who finds it will please return it
to the pi beta phi phouse, and no questions will
bo asked, not much. ya. ya, ya.
lot's see, where was i, oh yes. our hasher regrets
he'll onlv be able to hmee, tod;iv, messieurs.
