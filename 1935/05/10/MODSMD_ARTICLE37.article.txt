# THE 						REVIEWER
## "AFTER OFFICE HOURS" 
### 
At (lie Varsity Theater
Clark Gable and Constance Ben
! nett in one of those films which
I you've forgotten all about a week
after you've seen itâ€”although while
' it lasts, the gags, gowns, and gals
; will prove amusing. The usual Cin- \

derella plot gets
into rjeverse
gear, for Gable, j
after -calling the :
yery rich Ben
nett all sorts of j
nasty names and j
pulling no end ,
of "meanies" on j
our .suffering sophisticate, puts what ]
if takes into the little glass slipper ;
and garners himself a wife and a
place in the social register. A very 1
interesting murder during the course j
of the film doesn't detract from it 1
in any way, in fact, we thought it !
pretty good.
