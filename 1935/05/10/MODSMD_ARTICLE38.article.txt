# "THE LITTLE COLONEL"
## 
### 
To quote Time, "The only thing
in the show which did not come out
of the Ark is Negro Bill Robinson's
dancing." The rest of it is trite
melodrama which gives Lionel Bar
rymore a chance to play an "old
Suhthem Cuhnel" without a South
ern accent. Shirley Temple proves
herself to be a capable actress and
completely steals the show. John
Lodge (the Yankee) and Evelyn
Venable marry against parental con
sent and it takes Shirley to bring
about the reconciliation. Temple
is at her cutest when she dons
hoopskirts and sings "Love's Young
Dream" on the harp.
