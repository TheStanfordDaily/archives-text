### 
Thirty - three Stanford students ;
: last year benefited by scholarships I
! supplied through the Commission 1
I on Student Aid, it was announced j
yesterday by J. E. McDowell, re
| cently chosen director of the com- j
i mission to succeed Dr. Harry Rey- j
nolds who will devote his whole time
to the activities of Stanford Asso
i ciates.
At Stanford, where half the stu- i
! dents are wholly or partially self- !
j supporting, there is great need for
I contributions for student aid. Once
i the richest university in America,

I privately owned universities in its |
i endowment per student. Only $50,-
000 is available for student aid as J
i compared with $307,000 available at i
Harvard, and $515,000 available at j
Yale.
No concerted drive for funds is j
; being made by the commission, but j
; the need of funds is constantly be- j
j ing brought to the attention ol j
! aiumni.
The commission, as now constitu- |
ted, includes, besides McDowell, i
Dean Mary Yost, Dean George B. |
| Culver. Professor Lowell Turrentine, |
; Assistant Registrar Karl Cowdery,
alumni and students De Lancey
