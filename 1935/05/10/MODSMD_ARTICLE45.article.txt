GREAT BRITAIN ON PARADE
The Britisher is a staid, aristocratic
sort of gentleman, who knows how'
to run colonies, keep the brown men
down, wear pith helmets, drink
scotch-and-sodas; who is mossy yet
stately with the tradition of the cen- J
turies; who likes to think that Eng
land is the Queen or the Mistress of j
the Seas; who calmly out-suaves > the
other diplomats of the world; who :
keeps his emotions marvelously in
check, and occasionally in a wild
outburst of enthusiasm exclaims in
measured tone: "Reahlly."
At least that is the average Ameri- ;
can view of the average British citi- j
zen. Britons — outside the movies I
and the comic strips—-were probably
never like that. But the facts oi the
case never prevented Americans j
from thinking the British was an 5
individual—cool, and calm, who usu- i
ally collected, and occasionally re- 1
pudiated.
!
But if illusions stilt remained as
to the staid qualities of the British,
the illusions melted away under the
burning heat of the Saver Jubilee.
It was deadly enough—to the repu
tation for English reserve —when the
London countryside went wild over
the Princess Marina and her royal
husband. Apparently the English— \
supposedly accustomed to royalty—
acted just as foolish then as the
Americans acted in the presence of
Queen Marie of Rumania and the
Marrying Mdivanis. But the Jubilee
reduced the multitudes of English
men to the level of the American
circus crowd.
According to the dispatches, there 1
were thousands sleeping jn the
streets to be on hand for a front row ,
look at the King passant. The bob
bies were overwhelmed by the surg- i

ing mobs; they wanted to see their
King.
Of course, like the flurry over
Masque Ball, the Silver Jubilee ex
citement soon passes. And. as in the j
j case of the Ball Contest, the good
I results linger on.
With a bit of intermittent pag
eantry, the British masses are held
iin check. Are there hard times?
Well, the King is sympathetic; and
! the King is of noble origin. Are ,
there crooked politicians? Well,
we've got a King; and he is noble.
| The Jubilee, the royal show—all that (
! may be illogical and un-British (as ,
! the American sees the British), but I
jit satisfies. And when social prob-
I lems are yet unsolved, it is well that
; the people are satislied.
