# CAMPUS OPINION
## LOVE CONTEST A FARCE 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
It, is the opinion of many on the j
campus that the recent selection of !
women in the "Chappie" as the
"loveliest co-eds" was indeed a j
ghastly farce. If Editor Steedman
had wandered blindfolded through j
the reference room of the "libe" he
could have done better. Granted !
there are exceptions.
Surely that remarkable "love is- j
sue" of the Chaparral can pick fif- |
teen of Stanford's loveliest on a j
purely pulchritudinous basis instead 1
of cow-towing to the selection of j
separate women's living groups. j
Love, ah what crimes have been j
committed in thy fair name!
