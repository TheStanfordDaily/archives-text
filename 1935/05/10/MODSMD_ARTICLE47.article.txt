The Editor, Sir:
To Messrs. Tripp and Hadley,
' those self-appointed judges of femi
nine loveliness —phooey!
The so-called "Lovely Ladies"
were not chosen by any member of
the Chaparral staff, but by the girls
themselves. Each house and each
: dormitory voting for the ones in
j their living groups whom they con
i sidered exemplifying "loveliness."
i The definition of the term "lovely"
was left to the voters —perhaps the
above gentlemen have their own
definition of the term — but the
i Chappies did not consider these gen
tlemen important enough judges to
consult them. Chappie apologizes for
overlooking such qualified men.
Nevertheless, the women them
selves did the choosing—and Chap
pie feejs that they did a commend
able job. The OLD BOY'S advice
to Tripp and Hadley is for them to
join a sorority, earn the right to
vote, and thus to lend their aid in
elevating the women's criteria of
"loveliness."
Sincerely,
I ' The OLD BOY
