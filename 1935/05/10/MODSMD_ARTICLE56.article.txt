# Mother's Day Boosts Sales, Report Stores

. Though F.D.R. would dispense
with Mother's Day, substituting for
it a 365-day period of adoration and
respect, Stanford students still cele
brate the occasion, and with increas
ing numbers of gifts, records of Palo
Alto and campus merchants reveal.
Long decried as the invention of
commercial publicists, Mother's Day
hasn't lost a shade of its sacredness
in the eyes of Stanford women and
roughs. "Business around this time
of the year is greater than at the
same time during previous years,
particularly among students,'' a Palo
Alto florist declared. "While tele
graphed orders aren't for amounts as
large, there are more of them."
The campus bookstore had a simi
lar report, showing that more Moth
er's Day cards were sold since 1930
than prior' to that year.
Candy is increasing in favor as a
Mother's Day item, local confec
tioners say. Hundreds of boxes are
sent all over the world by Stan
fordites, particularly by students
from the East and foreign countries.
All of which is the Daily's way of
hinting that next Sunday is "the
day" for doting mamas all over the
nation. A word to the wise . . .
