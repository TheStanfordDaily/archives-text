## Yellow Jack' Budget Cut, Says Dick Frank 
### 
Making caricatures of the cast,
putting chalk signs around the cam
pus, writing to critics, finding ush
ers, and guarding dress rehearsals
are only a few of the tasks com
pleted by Dick Frank and his dra
matic office i>i preparation for to
night's performance of "Yellow
Jack."
"Some people may think actors do
all the work," comments Frank, but
they certainly don't!" and produced a
list three pages long to prove his
point.

Royalty Is High

"Yellow Jack" cost twice as much
for production rights as plays pre
viously presented, so a wholesale
slicing of the budget was necessary.
This proved so successful that prices
were reduced from 25 to 50 per cent,
publicity started, and then the real
work began.
I A month before the play, an
' nouncements and posters are sent to
the printer, tickets obtained from the
Comptroller's office, money collected
for the playbooks, and ads solicited
for the back of the program.
Publicity Sent Out
Three weeks before the play,
1 posters are distributed, mail an
nouncements addressed, ad copy
i planned, letters written to critics,
two large posters made, caricatures
drawn, and announcements sent to
j local newspapers.
"Of course, the last two weeks are
the worst," said Frank. "Nothing
j really happens until then."
Hats with ostrich feathers cas
! ending down the back are in favor
j again.
