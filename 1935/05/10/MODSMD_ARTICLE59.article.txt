# Lagunita Maids Lose Hearts To Alexander Stanford Duck
## 
### Jane Heenan 
Living with 211 women isn't all
i fun, Alexander Stanford Duck has
: discovered in the two and a half
j weeks he has lived in Lagunita
| Court. Every day lie is the object of
' numerous "Oil's" and "Ah's"; "Isn't
i he darling?" and "I think he's the
| cutest thing!"
j At first he was most retiring and
| unhappy and spent his days in the
j seclusion of the bushes in the court
! yard, .shuddering visibly whenever
| he was accosted.
Enters Public Life
With his debut before the whole
' student body as an integral part of
J Lagunita's float in the water car
â–  nival, a great change occurred in
] Alexander's life. He came out of his
I shell (technically it was out of the
; bushes), dropped his bashful air and
I began to enjoy life in earnest.
Now he nonchalantly assumes that
the fountain is his private swimming
pool and the bank of ferns a throne
where it is his privilege to sit
majestically and be admired. Now
| he wanders around as he pleases,
, returning stare for stare, or giving
an impudent flip of his wings.
' In spite of the fact that he ar

f rived on Easter morning, Alexan- |
: der wasn't brought by the Easter j
! Bunny. No, it was a Western Union
! messenger boy who delivered him
! to Elizabeth Sinclair. In a sense he j

| was wired all the way from Yale, for |
| it was from New Haven that West
ern Union received the order to find
a 10-pound white duck, tie a big
bow and blue ribbon around its
j neck, and present it to Miss Sinclair
: with "love and Easter greetings."
The astonished telegraph office j
hunted high and low for a duck of j
I the right description, finally locating !
: Alexander in Mayfield. He was duly !
j scrubbed, clothed in blue ribbon, |
j and sent to establish his residence in !
i the dormitory. Miss Sinclair in turn
presented him to Lagunita, and
I there he will stay the rest of his life
| if he so desires.
Charming Duck
Alexander's charm has won the
j hearts of everyone from the director
I of the hall to the gardener. The lat-
I ter has, in fact, promised to see to it
! that the duck's summer i.s a safe
and happy one.
"Where's Alexander?" is the first
question the women ask as they
come out of the dining room. "There
he is," comes the answer as some
one spies him paddling in "his"
pool, waddling aimlessly about the
j court, or resting peacefully in the
1 bushes.
