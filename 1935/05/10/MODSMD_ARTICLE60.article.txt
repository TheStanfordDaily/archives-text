### HENRY TANI 
Lawyers have a better chance than |
, engineers and doctors to get higher
incomes, according to figures re
cently compiled from data for 1927
to 1929 in a comparison of the med
ian incomes for the first five years
and the median peak incomes in cer
j tain specified professions.
Figures show, for instance, that j
the lawyer's median income for the
first five years is $2584, and the
median peak income, $7410. The ]
range in income is thus $4826 from
i the first five years up to the ultimate '
peak income attainable in the law
profession.
List Median Incomes
Engineering, medicine, and den
! tistry yield for the first five years
the median incomes of $2284, $2711,
and $2695, and median peak incomes
of $0271, $5553, and $5047, or ranges I
of $4987, 2842, and $2352, respectively, j
; in the three professions named. J
The average of the professional, |
I non-government salaries stated in j
this table credits $2105 as the median
income for the first five years, and
$4493 for the median peak income, j

1 with a range of $2388.
In another statistical table, a chm
j parison of incomes at the quarter,
i median, and three-quarter points
are made for specified professions
j including law, medicine, engineering
an ddentistry. Here, again, law |
shows the widest range: $2089 in
j come for the person at the first quar
tile mark, $3915 at the median, and
$6980 at the third quartile.

Lawyers have a better chance than |

incomes, according to figures re
cently compiled from data for 1927
to 1929 in a comparison of the med
ian incomes for the first five years
and the median peak incomes in cer
j tain specified professions.
Figures show, for instance, that j
the lawyer's median income for the
first five years is $2584, and the
median peak income, $7410. The ]
range in income is thus $4826 from

peak income attainable in the law
profession.

Engineering, medicine, and den

the median incomes of $2284, $2711,
and $2695, and median peak incomes
of $0271, $5553, and $5047, or ranges I
of $4987, 2842, and $2352, respectively, j

I non-government salaries stated in j
this table credits $2105 as the median
income for the first five years, and
$4493 for the median peak income, j

j parison of incomes at the quarter,
i median, and three-quarter points
are made for specified professions
j including law, medicine, engineering
an ddentistry. Here, again, law |
shows the widest range: $2089 in

tile mark, $3915 at the median, and
$6980 at the third quartile.
