# POLOISTS TO PLAY U.S.C. TOMORROW IN RETURN MATCH
## Six Cards Leave Tonight; Coach Remains Here 
### Charles Thomas 
Six Stanford poloists will leave
tonight for Los Angeles to meet the
U.S.C. four in a return engagement
Saturday afternoon. The Indians won
from the Southern California riders
here last Friday by the score of 7 to
4 after a close contest. The Trojans
offered unexpectedly strong resist
ance to lead the favored redshirts
until the last two chukkers.
With such a creditable showing
turned in on strange ponies, an S.C.
upset on their home grounds would
not be impossible, though from all
indications the Cards should win.
Grubbs Stays Home
Lieut. H. Y. Grubbs, who, because
of an army inspection next week,
will be unable to accompany his
team south, has announced that the
invading redshirt contingent will in
clude Captain Bill Rogers, Bob Ful
lerton, Carl Beal, Russ Rasmussen,
Bill Enemark, and Jim Henderson.
Rasmussen, regular No. 3, who has
been out of action for the past three
weeks with a knee injury incurred
in the Menlo J.C. encounter, will
accompany the team, though it is
improbable that he will do any
playing, Lieut. Grubbs said.
With Rasmussen out, the redshirt
line-up will be the .same that faced
S.C. in the first game. Bill Enemark,
who has shown great improvement
in recent practice, will play at No. 1,
Captain Bill Rogers can be depend
ed upon to turn in his usual sterling
game at 2, Carl Beal will be at No. 3,
while Bob Fullerton will complete
the line-up at his regular* No. 4 spot.
Stars Show Class
This combination has improved
steadily with every game and prac
tice together. Wednesday, in an
intersquad encounter, the varsity,
minus Rogers, showed real power in
whitewashing the second string nine
goals to nothing. Another practice
intersquad scrimmage is scheduled
for this afternoon before the squad
leaves for Los Angeles.
S.C. will probably line up with
George Beck ley, Captain Don Spiers,
Bo\) Shaw, and Chuck Wheeler.
A tentative game against Califor
nia has been set for Monday or
Tuesday of next week. Definite
word has not yet been received from
Berkeley, Lieut. Grubbs stated,
where the Bears are trying to re
assemble their quartet since schol
astic activity has ceased with final
exams this week. A game against
Oregon State College will be played
here on Friday, May 17. The Indians
won two games from the northern
ers in Corvallis last quarter. Both
wex - e indoor encounters.
