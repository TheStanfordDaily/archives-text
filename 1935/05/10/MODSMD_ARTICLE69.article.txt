# MURAL SOFTBALL FINALS TO BE STARTED MONDAY
## 
### 
Playoffs between winning teams in
the seven intramural softball leagues
will start Monday and continue
throughout most of next week.
Schedules have not yet been com
pleted, but will be announced in
Monday's Daily.
With all games played but Mon
day's protested Breakers-Beta tilt ]
for the championship of League 111, |
the results of the various circuits 'â– 
are as follows:
Phi Delta Theta defeated Delta
Chi, Los Arcos, and El Tigre to
capture the League crown with a
perfect record of three victories.
Delta Chi took second, losing only
to the Phi Delts.
Sequoia II Wins
Sequoia II won two straight games
to take the honors in League 11. i
The A.T.O.'s also won twice, but
lost a third contest. Theta Xi and {
Delta Tau Delta occupied the cellar
positions.
The standings in League 111 re
sulted in a tie for first between the j
Homesteaders and Phi Delta Phi. j
Each defeated the other once, as !
well as trouncing the Kappa Sigma j
and Encina IE nines. The Home- |

steaders' win over the lawyers was
questioned; so it is uncertain as to
whether or not there will be a play
off.
Play in League IV was like that in
League I in that one team won all
three of its games, and the second
place nine won two and lost one. The
Dekes, El Cuadro, the S.A.E.'s, and
the Theta Delts placed in that order.
The same thing happened in
League V, with the D.U.'s coming
out on top, ahead of the Chi Psi's.
Thii'd and fourth were taken by the
Phi Sigs and the Forgei's.
Beta-Breakers Play-off
Either the Betas or the Bx*eakers
will win the League VI crown, de
pending on Monday's play-off. The
losing outfit will take second, one
notch above the Fijis and two above
El Capitan.
With two consecutive ti'iumphs,
the Business School took the title
in League VII. The Phi Psi's took
second, El Toro II third, and the
Menio Juniors last.
Theta Chi, Alpha Delta Phi, and
Sigma Nu won the hardball leagues,
with the Phi Kaps, El Campo, and
Sequoia I as runners-up.
