## A 						FEW OF FRESNO'S MINOR ATTRACTIONS 
### 
When GO7 athletes get together at
ihe peak of a track season on a fast
track some classy performances
can't be avoided—that might be the
slogan for tomorrow's Fresno Relays.
Publicity to date has centered on
the team relays, which are nat
urals for entertainment. With the
Trojans almost a cinch for a world
mark in the mile relay, if they're
pressed and c»in keep four fresh
men; with California and U.S.C.
matching probably, five of the doz
en best hurdlers in the country in
the shuttle race; and with Norm
Bright chasing Bob Fowler and
Benny Benavidez in the mile of
the medley relay, the Fresno fes
tival can really count on its relays
for color.
But the individual competition
will bring performances that will
equal those of any meet on the Coast
this year. Watching Sammy Klop
stock lick a field a high hurdlers
never fails to bring a thrill. The
100-yard dash between Milton Holt
of the Fresno school and George An
derson, "the incomparable," will set
tle the season's debate over which
is the faster.
