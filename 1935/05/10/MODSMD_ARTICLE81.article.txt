# MARTY AND CORNY WILL JUMP IT OFF
## 
### 
When the appearance of a world's
champion hardly gets a line of pub
licity in the advance stories the
press certainly isn't "making" the
news. Walter Marty made the rec
ord books on Angell Field last April,
and ever since the Stanford fans
have been anxious to get another
look at the great jumper. Coast pro
moters have been trying all season
to arrange a duel between Marty and
Cornelius Johnson, great Compton
J.C. jumper and an Olympic veteran
in his high school days, and Fresno
will have it tomorrow night.
Meadows, Sefton, and Hooker of
the Trojan pole vault troupe should
put their minds to the world's rec
ord tomorrow night, and take it
away. Last Saturday in the Stanford
Stadium pit there was no more dis
gusted person than Meadows, who
had the misfortune of easily clearing
14 feet 6 ; 'h inches and then knocking
the bar off with his elbow on the
way down. Sefton is another who is
familiar with dropping 14 feet into
the sawdust pit. The two should pass
all jumps until 14 feet 2 inches, and
set a record. It would be a good talk
ing point for Stanford's California
Intercollegiates next week.
