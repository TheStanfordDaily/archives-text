# DON'T BE SURPRISED IF THE SLINGER
## 
### 
Among those track greats, who
are about as prominent in the Fresno
Relays as Milpitas' 5:02 miler in the
state meet axe a group of Stanford
weight men who have been toying
with world's records for the past
few years. John Lyman had the c hot
mark for a week or so, but a 53-foot
toss with the 16-pound ball won't
even rate a glance from the cash
customers these days.
Then <here's Slinger Dunn, who
has every chance of surprising his
valley friends by taking the
world's discus record with him
when he leaves Fresno Sunday
morning. The Slinger's 17ft-foot
throws have been coming with
startling regularity during the
past month, and once the platter
goes out beyond 171 feet 11 inches
another Stanford name will go on
the books. Glenn Randell of Cali
fornia. Ken Carpenter of S.C., and
Here Laßorde and Bob Jones of
(he Club, have all thrown over 1(50
feel, and the battle for the other
places should be a close one.
