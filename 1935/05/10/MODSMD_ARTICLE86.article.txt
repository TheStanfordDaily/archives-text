# Stuart Talks On Poor Pay Of Consuls
## Foreign Service Discussed Before Women's Club 
### 
"Although the maximum salary
allowed for any foreign service offi
cial under the employ of the United
States is $17,500, some of the am
bassadors in more prominent posts
have calculated their yearly expen
ditures around $100,000," Dr. Gra
ham Stuart, professor of political
science, stated in his address on
"Diplomats and Consuls at Work"
before the Stanford Women's £lub
in their clubhouse yesterday after
noon.
Politics Decides Posts
"The positions of ambassadors
and ministers are usually political
appointments. The career men—
those who work up from the ranks
and are specialists in the fields of
foreign service — rarely get these
posts."
Control of the foreign service de
partment, Professor Stuart contin- 1
ued, lies with about fifteen men be
ginning with the President and Sec
retary of State assisted by under
secretaries and expert career men.
At present the foreign service branch
is being subjected to greater re
trenchment than ever before in
American history.
Consuls Do Work
The career men comprise the
ranks of the consular service, the
more arduous and difficult branch
of foreign work. It is the duty of the
consul to protect and promote his
country's trade, principally by ex
pert political reporting.
The American consuls in addition
are concerned with problems of sea
men, shipping regulations and im
migration.
In conclusion, Dr. Graham stated
that at this time the United States
is, on the whole, well represented in
most of the important European
capitals.
