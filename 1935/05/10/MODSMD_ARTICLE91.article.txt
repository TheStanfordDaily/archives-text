Dr. Ralph Willard, Hollywood biochemist, after five years experi
menting, has perfected a process for restoring to life guinea pigs that
have been frozen for two to 22 days. Body temperatures are restored
with an electric current, while blood transfusions and injections of
adrenalin-ephedr ine coupled with mechanical processes start heart
action. He believes by freezing certain portions of the human body
impaired tissues may be restored to a normal state. Dr. Willard is
