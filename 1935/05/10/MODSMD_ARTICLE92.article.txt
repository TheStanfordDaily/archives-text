### 
WASHINGTON, May 9 (/P). —A
fast-stepping world armament race
in which Japan leads other powers
toward a treaty-strength navy and
European nations project bigger
military outlays, today was disclosed

viding for "the national defense,"
had information on increased arms
budgets in Great Britain. Japan,

Included, members Said, were
confidential data indicating direct
appropriations for military pur
poses in the next financial year
will exceed past peace time rec
ords.

tary forces abroad were conceded to
be incomplete. But reports indica
ted that since Germany stepped out
side the Versailles treaty, thousands

of men have been called to arms in

viewed in authoritative quarters:
Japan was slated to attain a Lon
don treaty strength navy on the
5-5-3 ratio by 1936, having provided
for 88 ships of various types, 34 of
which have been laid down and 17
completed.
Japan increased naval personnel
last year by 5,400, England by
1,350, and the United States by
1,257, while France dropped oil
(!42 and Italy (>7l).
Since the Washington arms treaty
of 1922, Great Britain had built 174
warships of all types, Japan 168,
France 177, Italy 175, and the United
States 70.
Japan headed England and the
United States with the greatest
number of new or under-age war
ships, with 155 to England's 132, and
85 for the United States.
