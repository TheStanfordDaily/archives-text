# S.F. Fair Board Starts Work on Exposition Site
## 
### 
With tht* May 2nd mandate of the |
people of the Golden Gate behind 1
them, the board of directors of the
1938 San Francisco Bay Exposition 1
now face the gigantic task of pre- [
paring the site at Yerba Buena shoals ,
at a cost of many millions of dollars. '
To ensure the success of this en- I
terprise, according to Leland Cutler,
president of the board of directors, '
will mean three years of relentless I
toil on the part of the planners of j
the fair, and the whole-hearted co- j
operation of each Bay city.
Initial Outlay $3,000,000
The initial outlay for the reclama- |
tion of Yerba Buena shoals will be j
about $3,000,000, to defray which the \
board hopes to obtain PWA funds, j
The cost of setting up this island will i
probably run several times this sum, j
including buildings, equipment and j
the like. However, private interests
will invest huge sums for advertis- |
ing purposes.
Whon the fair is finally terminat- j
ed, the Yerba Buena shoals will be j
turned into a municipal airport, and
the streets will be transformed into |
i unways. A 900-foot easement from
the shore of Yerba Buena Island ;
will separate the artificially con- !
struct ed fair site from the island of ,
rock, the easement will be dredged j
out to a depth of 35 to 40 feet, and
facilities for submarines to dock j
will probably be installed.
Asks Congressional Action
Next week, Cutler plans lo fly to i
Washington, D.C., to aid the pas- i
sage of a joint resolution through
Congress which will recognize the
international status of the project, J
and authorize President Roosevelt to
make representations to foreign
countries to participate in the dis
play.
Although it is not possible to pre
dict. accurately attendance at so
early a date, it is estmiated that 12
to 20 million paid admissions will be
received at this international exposi
tions in 1938.
It will probably be financed
through a scheme similar to that
used in the Chicago Century of
Progress Exposition, that is a bond

issue underwritten by business in
terests, plus whatever PWA and
similar funds can be obtained.

and authorize President Roosevelt to
make representations to foreign
countries to participate in the dis
play.
Although it is not possible to pre
dict. accurately attendance at so
early a date, it is estmiated that 12
to 20 million paid admissions will be
received at this international exposi
tions in 1938.
It will probably be financed
through a scheme similar to that
used in the Chicago Century of
Progress Exposition, that is a bond

issue underwritten by business in
terests, plus whatever PWA and
similar funds can be obtained.
Leland Cutler, president of the
Stanford Board of Trustees and
Stanford* alumnus, heads the 55
directors of the 1938 exposition.
With tht* May 2nd mandate of the |
people of the Golden Gate behind 1
them, the board of directors of the
1938 San Francisco Bay Exposition 1
now face the gigantic task of pre- [
paring the site at Yerba Buena shoals ,
at a cost of many millions of dollars. '
To ensure the success of this en- I
terprise, according to Leland Cutler,
president of the board of directors, '
will mean three years of relentless I
toil on the part of the planners of j
the fair, and the whole-hearted co- j
operation of each Bay city.
Initial Outlay $3,000,000
The initial outlay for the reclama- |
tion of Yerba Buena shoals will be j
about $3,000,000, to defray which the \
board hopes to obtain PWA funds, j
The cost of setting up this island will i
probably run several times this sum, j
including buildings, equipment and j
the like. However, private interests
will invest huge sums for advertis- |
ing purposes.
Whon the fair is finally terminat- j
ed, the Yerba Buena shoals will be j
turned into a municipal airport, and
the streets will be transformed into |
i unways. A 900-foot easement from
the shore of Yerba Buena Island ;
will separate the artificially con- !
struct ed fair site from the island of ,
rock, the easement will be dredged j
out to a depth of 35 to 40 feet, and
facilities for submarines to dock j
will probably be installed.
Asks Congressional Action
Next week, Cutler plans lo fly to i
Washington, D.C., to aid the pas- i
sage of a joint resolution through
Congress which will recognize the
international status of the project, J
and authorize President Roosevelt to
make representations to foreign
countries to participate in the dis
