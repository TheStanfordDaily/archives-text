# Plane Crash Inquiry Ends In Oral Fight
## Jury Finally Agrees To 'Accident Verdict 
### 
MACON, Mo., May 9 (/P).—Local
inquiry into the fatal crash of a
transcontinental air liner near here
ended today after additional oral
exchanges between an attorney for
TWA and members of the coroner's
jury. Five persons, including Sena
tor Bronson Cutting of New Mexico,
died in the wreck.
In its final form the verdict of the
jury was left as revised last night,
with the inserted word "accidental"
—looked up in a dictionary by the
jury this morning—included.
Log Believed Altered
At final sessions today Manvel
Davis, TWA attorney, tried vainly
to question members of the coroner's
jury about whether they had inti
mated in newspaper interviews a
belief the log of the pilot on the
last flight of the big transport had
been altered since the crash.
"You have no right to question the
jury after a verdict has been re
turned," responded Charles Fower,
himself an aviator, and the coroner,
Dr. W. H. Gooch, sustained him.
Picture Officials Ilurt
The body of the fifth victim, Mrs.
William Kaplan of Los Angeles, was
sent west for burial, accompanied
by her husband, a motion picture
executive, who suffered a fractured
ankle.
Paul Wing, another film official,
lay at point of death in Samaritan
Hospital, and injuries of C. G. Drew,
also of the movie colony, were con
sidered critical. Four other injured
persons still in the hospital were
improved satisfactorily.
Funeral services tomorrow were
planned in New York for Senator
Cutting, Miss Jeanne Anne Hillias
of Kansas City and the two pilots,
Harvey Bolton and Kenneth Gree
son, the others killed.
