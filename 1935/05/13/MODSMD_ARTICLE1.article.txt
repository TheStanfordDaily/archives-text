# Lamson Jury Asks Dismissal After 15 Hours Deliberation
## Judge Refuses Request Of Jury Unable To Make Decision on Case COURTROOM CROWDED Foreman Believes Decision Will Be Impossible 
### 
SAN JOSE, May 12 —Weary
jurors, deliberating the fate of Dav
id A. Lamson, were locked up for
the night at 8:45 o'clock, apparently
deadlocked on the matter of his
guilt 01 innocence.
The jury was locked up by its own
request after the same request had
been denied when it went out to
dinner at 5:54 p.m.
The jury first announced it wanted
to see the judge at 11:20 a.m. and it
was nearly noon before Judge Syer
appeared. Lamson had been brought,
into the courtroom. Further delay
was caused by the failure of Prose
cutors A. P. Lindsay and Herbert
Bridges to appear until 12:10.
Many Votes Taken
Mrs. Mary Richter, chosen as
forelady of the jury, told Judge
Syer then that "we have taken a
number of votes and have been
unable to reach a verdict."
"It must appear there is no rea
sonable probability that yuu can
reach a verdict," Judge Syer de
clared.
"There are many issues in this
trial and there should l>e a full
and complete deliberation on all
issues. I feel you have not Ivyd
sufficient time to make such a full
and complete deliberation. You
will therefore return to your
room for further consideration."
The jury started to file out when
Defense Attorney Edwin V. McKen
zie requested that the jury be asked
whether it "believed it could reach
a verdict."
Jury Called Back
The jury came back into the
courtroom and after Prosecutor
Bridges had opposed McKenzie's re
quest, Judge Syer asked the ques
tion of Mrs. Richter: "I do not be
lieve it will be possible that certain
votes can be changed," she said.
Judge Syer, however, returned the
jury to its room expressing hope
further deliberation would bring a
verdict.
The jury received the case at 5:30
p.m. Friday. A.s the jury left the
courthouse it had deliberated ap
proximately 21 of the 51 hours the
case had been in its hands. The re
quest to be locked up for the night
was taken to indicate there was no
change in voting.
Spectators Early
The courtroom was again crowded
as the jury announced its inability
to decide Lamson's guilt. Before the
jury returned to the courthouse to
start deliberations this morning,
there were several spectators in the
courtroom, and a few minutes after
the jury arrived all seats were oc
cupied.
Lamson appeared nervous in
the courtroom but displayed no
emotion when the deadlock was
announced. If the jury is dis
charged without reaching a ver
dict. it was considered unlikely in
authoritative circles here, that he
would be tried a third time.
He was originally convicted and
sentenced to hang and after a year
in San Quentin Prison was returned
to the county jail here after the
•state Supreme Court had granted
him a new trial.
Ho is charged with beating Allcne
Thorpe Lamson, formerly of La
mar, Mo., to death with a piece of
iron pipe on Memorial Day of 1933
in their home on the campus of
Stanford University.
Through the 12-week trial the de
fense sought to show the attractive
young matron had falien in the
bathtub, striking her head on a wash
basin nearby.
