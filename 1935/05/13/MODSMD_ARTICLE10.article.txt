## 
### 
The new outbreak of the
measles epidemic has confined
40 students in the Palo Alto
Hospital according to hospital
authorities. This is an increase
of 26 cases over last Friday's
number. Dr. Thomas A. Storey,
however, reports that there
have been no serious cases so
far and that there are not likely
to be any.
Starting nearly three weeks
ago the epidemic seemed to
have reached its peak when 71
cases were reported. It then
subsided until only four stu
dents of the number admitted
over the week-end were con
fined at the first of last week.
