# J. PILSUDSKI, IRON MAN OF POLAND, DIES
## Uremia Attack Ends Life Of Dictator Following Three-Day Coma 
### 
WARSAW, May 12 (A'). â€”Marshal
Josef Pilsudski, 67, Poland's man
of power, died at 8:45 oclock tonight
after an uremia attack, on the ninth
anniversary of the 1926 coup that
made him virtual dictator of the
land.
Unconscious for the last three
days, while his associates carried on
their negotiations for security in
Europe, he passed on calmly. The
news was announced two hours later
to a throng gathered before Belve
dore Palace. Authorities took all
possible precautions to prevent his
death from precipitating internal
disturbances. Police were rein
forced and officers patrolling the
streets were equipped with tear
bombs. The cabinet gathered quick
ly in special session to deliberate on
the political situation.
Death interrupted the career of
Pilsudski, born an aristocrat and
from youth a revolutionary, just as
he had reached its peak. Only re
cently, constitutional reforms had
been completed, placing virtually
limitless power in the hands of the
President of the republic and the
Marshall was expected to assume
this office upon the apparently im
pending resignation of President
Ignace Moscicki.
Since the reform of the constitu
tion, the regime has had its power
well in hand and no disturbances
were expected generally to follow
the Marshal's death.
The first intimation of his demise
came at 9 p.m. when a reception for
the French Ambassador, who will
leave Warsaw within a few days,
was cancelled suddenly. His entour
age had expected the death momen
tarily.
French Foreign Minister Pierre
Laval, who came to Warsaw to as
sure Polish authorities of France's
continued friendship despite the re
cently concluded Franco-Russian
mutual assistance pact, had pro
ceeded to Moscow earlier in the day
without seeing his host.
After the announcement from the
palace of his death, the Warsaw ra
dio stopped its program.
