# PATMAN BILL VETO WAITED BY CONGRESS
## Bonus Measure May Reach White House Tomorrow; Eccles Favorable 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 12 </P).—A j
bonus-minded Congress eagerly j
looked toward its leaders tonight for
some new word from President i
Roosevelt which might guide future j
action on the cash payment issue j
and stimulate a dragging legislative
program.
Opinion was divided over the pos
sible outcome of week-end confer
ences between the President and
Democratic chieftains, held in the
clear, cool air of Tonoloway Ridge
at the Woodmont Rod and Gun Club
on the Maryland-West Virginia bor
der.
Powerful Drive
Representative Pat man, Demo
crat of Texas, author of the new
money bill scheduled to go to the
White House from the Senate Tues
day, said today many of his col
leagues had gained an impression
that the President had been urged
by some leaders to propose a new
compromise.
On the other hand, the Texan
explained, some felt that Roosevelt
could carry out a threatened veto
in Uie face of a powerful drive in
and out of Congress to have the
bonus paid with new currency. Pat
man added:
"The statements of Jesse Jones,
chairman of the Reconstruction
Finance Corporation, and Marriner
Eccles, governor of the Federal
Reserve Board, pave the way,
however, for the President to sign
the measure. Of course, we will
not know what Mr. Roosevelt is
going to do until the fishing party
returns from the mountains."
Eccles has said the Patman bill
would not necessarily be inflation
ary while Jones said an additional
bonus debt would not. be "unbear
able."
Focused on Senate
On the other hand, Democratic
and Republican opponents of the
cash bonus, counted heavily on mar
shaling the Senate votes necessary
to sustain a veto. Administration
leaders claimed they have 35 sure
ballots — three more than the 32
needed to block a motion to over
ride the President. All hope of stop
ping ihe bonus in the House has
been abandoned. Speaker Byrns
conceded more than the required
two-thirds majority wouid be forth
coming.
