BERKELEY, May 12 (/P). — It's
enough to make a girl chew up pen
cils and pencils—this "send-a-dame"
chain letter idea at the University of
California.
"I can't see where it's going to
end," said MLss Mary Kirk, pretty
freshman co-ed, as she contemplated
today* the prospect of being "dated
up for years and years and years."
Miss Kirk's name appeared on the
"send-a-dame" letters at the top of a
list of five. Men students receiving
the letters were directed to make a
"date" with the top girl, scratch her
name from the list, add a new one,
and send copies along to five friends.
"It looks like we might be
chained for life," said Miss Kirk, a
member of Delta Delta Delta soror
ity. She thought, just off-hand, that
might manage 26,000 dates, at
the rate of one a day, in about 70
years.
