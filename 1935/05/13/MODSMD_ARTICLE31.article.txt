# Vote Down Tomorrow's Amendment
## 
### 
One more day remains before the campus
voles on the latest amendment to the consti
tution that one to exclude graduates from
I lie presidential and vice-presidential offices
of the Associated Students.
At the special election two weeks ago, ap
proximately tour hundred and fifty voted
1 .*{ per cent of the entire student body. It is
imperative that a far greater number come
to the polls tomorrow, and at the same time
it is a lest of whether there is enough student
interest at Stanford to make a campus election
mean something.
As to the question itself. Probably no more
than a handful ol student body ollicers real
ize what the results will he should the amend
ment pass. The administration realizes it only
too well; only those most concerned the
students themselves —who have the deciding
voice, are the most ignorant.
Should graduates be excluded from office
al Stanford, even these two positions, a com
plete reorganization of graduates will be made
necessary by the I niversity. At present grad
uates pay four dollars each quarter, just as
freshmen, sophomores and everyone else. For
this they are entitled to all the privileges
granted every member of the student body.
Should the graduates be excluded from
ollices, this four-dollar sum will be canceled.
This means that the Associated Students will
lose over four thousand dollars of revenue
each year. At the same time, good will be
tween graduate and undergraduate will be
lost, once the graduate student feels he is
bring discriminated against because ol his
year in school.
Last Friday, the Daily pointed out the fact
that no discrimination should be made as to
status in school, but that the criterion of
candidates for office should be ability alone.
Today the relationship of graduate student
to the remainder of the campus undergradu
ate population and to the Administration is
stressed. It is up to every person in school to
vole the amendment down tomorrow, lor ii
they do not, it is a direct step toward cutting
the financial throat of student government.
