Merely scratched on at the semi-panel dis
cussion on problems of student government
last week was one of the questions of para
mount interest to the undergraduate—that
of the value of the present grading system.
Related subjects such as the honor code and
the Mawlout were reviewed in detail while
[hat of the alphabetical markings was prac
tically ignored.
Fundamentally the questions ol the code
with its temptations and the Hawlout with
its misuses are based upon the main problem
of grades and the present emphasis on degrees
of so-called "knowledge" in a subject. If
those degrees or alphabetical differences were
abolished, the need for concern over violations
of the honor code or for misrepresentations,
of the Mawlout would be considerably les
sened.
A more intelligent grading system com
posed of "plus, minus" or "passing with
honor, passing, or failing" would do much to
quid bickerings over the attending evils of
the present scheme.
