# Roosevelt "On the Spot"
## 
### 
Floods of telegrams, lellers, and threats
from all over the country pour into the White
Mouse daily, purporting to he a cross-section
cll public opinion on the Patman bonus bill.
Do these thousands of letters and telegrams
mean that the country is overwhelmingly in
favor dI the bill? Hardly. Thev mean, rather,
that ;m organized group is putting its entire
resources into the fight. A few newspapers,
the American Legion, and some political lire
eaters like Huey Long and Father Coughlin
are most strongly represented.
Mr. Roosevelt is in a tight spot. Next year
will be 1930, proving ground of, all his New
Deal and the Democratic supremacy which
lias nourished since '32; and he cannot politi
eally alTord to antagonize even a small section
of the public.
The fact remains that the issue of $2,200,-
000 which the bill proposes is unsound from
a money standpoint. II is not backed by de
posits. and would exist solely on credit, which
was also the basis of the Continental dollar
and the (icrman mark.
Mr. Roosevelt's veto, expected and de
nounced by some, will prove bis belief in a
principle as opposed to mere polities; a belief
which a lesser executive might easily put aside
in the face of opposition.
