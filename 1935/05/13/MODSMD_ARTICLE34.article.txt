# Poor Old Horse Racing
## 
### 
Not far from tin* Stanford campus, the
Sport of Kings is bring run oIT <Inilv ,%t one of
I he peninsnla race tracks. Once upon a time
that's what they dubbed horse racing. But
now. even with almighty Damon Hunvon and
Paid (iallico trying to uphold the ancient
order of the hoofs in the East, horse racing
in California has all the rpialilies of a cozy
gnme of tiddlewinks.
Muddy tracks, poor decisions, very doubtful
riding and continual complaints all total up
to the sum of one big headache. The sport is
line for the professional gamblers in San
Francisco who place their bets at the neigh
borhood cigar counter and don't bother to see
the races. II is also line for the socialites who

buy their season boxes and spend the after
nouns promenading down the clubhouse in i
' their best accoutrements.
The trouble is that it's pretty tough on those i
very few people who slill remember when :
horse racing was a sport and not merely I
i conducted entirely for the sake of gambling.
Poor nags, seedy stables and a very dubious
lot of jockeys seem to find their way onto the !
race tracks of the state, and the ordinary |
citizen doesn't know the difference anyhow. â€¢
It is all a very crude display, varnished over j
with a few good races and high purses at odd
intervals. In the Fast, at Arlington and Bel
mont and some of the other fine tracks, horse ;
racing slill clings to the name of being a legiti
mate sport. Hut in California the races are I
staged first and last to gain money, the people j
flock to win some of it, and the poor horses j
1 are merely a neglected device for legitimizing !
the exchange of dollars between the horse- !
owner and the small gamblers.
