# WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE NEW DEAL?
## 
### CROMPTON BANGS, Jr 
Besides these few figures, it's pretty hard to tell just
how things are going. Last year the worst drought in
50 years cut wheat and corp production to a 25-year
low;, and a big dent was made in the big surplus stocks
on hand. Prices naturally went up. Except for the
AAA benefit checks and the emergency drought re
lief payments the farmers got little; those who had
wheat, corn, and oats got high prices, but many more
had all or a good portion of their crop burned up by
the heat.
' So far we can see that the farmers as a whole,
especially wheat and corn, is better off thnn two
years ago; lie has some cash and Sears' and Ward's
are paying dividends again. But this is only one
side of the picture. The other side is not so
bright.
KING COTTON
Most of the crops raised in this country have
prices established by world and not domestic markets.
The larger the proportion exported the more likely
this is. In most years the U.S. exported half its cot
ton. Prices were as low as cents in 1932 and the
South suffered. Now we have 12-cent cotton (7 cents
in gold), a 4.2-cent a pound processing tax, and
acreage planted cut by 25 per cent.
In spite of ihis the South is grumbling. The cotton
raising system there really depends on total volume;
now that U.S. exports less cotton and uses less itself
they are in a pretty bad way. But that's r.ot all. Last
year for the first time since the Civil War the U.S.
planted less than half the world's cotton. It usually
raised around two-thirds the total.
What with foreign markets evaporating, domes
tic consumers howling at the high prices and the
share-croppers n ,ud giimers getting pretty sore,
the AAA is apparently in real hot water on tho
cotton program. Then the N«w England textile
manufacturers are kicking because they can't
pass the tax on to the consumer. Secretary Wal
lace gets sore at everybody, but he hasn't found a
way out yet.
PYRAMIDING THE TAXES
Latest studies have shown that the 4.2 per pound
tax on cotton (paid by the textile manufacturer) is
pyramided to 12 cents when it reaches you and me.
Ten per cent of the price of a loaf of bread is process
ing tax, 20 per cent of a pork chop, but only 3 per
cent of a pack of cigarettes. As long as the consumer
feels no pain, this system will work. But there are
already plenty of howls about the high price of pork
(helped along by pyramiding the 'tax). When Mrs.
Housewife starts buying substitutes the fun will begin
for Mr. Wallace.
ON THE OUTSIDE LOOKING IN
The beef and sheep men are still outside. From
what they have seen they are afraid of AAA. Last
year Secretary Wallace was so anxious to get them
into the benefit plan that he was willing to pay almost
any price for arfy decrepit cattle or sheep. Naturally
they sold. Then they suspect that the administration
tried to shut off the export market to enforce the AAA
on them. At any rate they are rugged individualists,
and the drought and government charity having aolved
their problems, they want to remain such.
In spite of the agonized howls on cotton manu
facturers, etc., the AAA is worth keeping. So far
cotton is its worst mistake. The Washington end
is O.K. As long as we can have part of the popula
tion supporting the other it may work. But the
NRA has jacked up prices so far and so fast that
if it weren't for the processing tax and government
handouts, the farmer would bb back where he
started from.

ON THE OUTSIDE LOOKING IN
The beef and sheep men are still outside. From
what they have seen they are afraid of AAA. Last
year Secretary Wallace was so anxious to get them
into the benefit plan that he was willing to pay almost
any price for arfy decrepit cattle or sheep. Naturally
they sold. Then they suspect that the administration
tried to shut off the export market to enforce the AAA
on them. At any rate they are rugged individualists,
and the drought and government charity having aolved
their problems, they want to remain such.
In spite of the agonized howls on cotton manu
facturers, etc., the AAA is worth keeping. So far
cotton is its worst mistake. The Washington end
is O.K. As long as we can have part of the popula
tion supporting the other it may work. But the
NRA has jacked up prices so far and so fast that
if it weren't for the processing tax and government
handouts, the farmer would bb back where he
started from.
Tomorrow: Ilclief.
Besides these few figures, it's pretty hard to tell just
how things are going. Last year the worst drought in
50 years cut wheat and corp production to a 25-year
low;, and a big dent was made in the big surplus stocks
on hand. Prices naturally went up. Except for the
AAA benefit checks and the emergency drought re
lief payments the farmers got little; those who had
wheat, corn, and oats got high prices, but many more
had all or a good portion of their crop burned up by
the heat.
' So far we can see that the farmers as a whole,
especially wheat and corn, is better off thnn two
years ago; lie has some cash and Sears' and Ward's
are paying dividends again. But this is only one
side of the picture. The other side is not so
bright.
KING COTTON
Most of the crops raised in this country have
prices established by world and not domestic markets.
The larger the proportion exported the more likely
this is. In most years the U.S. exported half its cot
ton. Prices were as low as cents in 1932 and the
South suffered. Now we have 12-cent cotton (7 cents
in gold), a 4.2-cent a pound processing tax, and
acreage planted cut by 25 per cent.
In spite of ihis the South is grumbling. The cotton
raising system there really depends on total volume;
now that U.S. exports less cotton and uses less itself
they are in a pretty bad way. But that's r.ot all. Last
year for the first time since the Civil War the U.S.
planted less than half the world's cotton. It usually
raised around two-thirds the total.
What with foreign markets evaporating, domes
tic consumers howling at the high prices and the
share-croppers n ,ud giimers getting pretty sore,
the AAA is apparently in real hot water on tho
cotton program. Then the N«w England textile
manufacturers are kicking because they can't
pass the tax on to the consumer. Secretary Wal
lace gets sore at everybody, but he hasn't found a
way out yet.
PYRAMIDING THE TAXES
Latest studies have shown that the 4.2 per pound
tax on cotton (paid by the textile manufacturer) is
pyramided to 12 cents when it reaches you and me.
Ten per cent of the price of a loaf of bread is process
ing tax, 20 per cent of a pork chop, but only 3 per
cent of a pack of cigarettes. As long as the consumer
feels no pain, this system will work. But there are
already plenty of howls about the high price of pork
(helped along by pyramiding the 'tax). When Mrs.
Housewife starts buying substitutes the fun will begin
