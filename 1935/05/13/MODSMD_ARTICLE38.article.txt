STILL MORE LOVELINESS
The Editor, Sir:
The OLD BOY'S supposedly scin
tillating humor when used to ridi
cule an intelligent objection to . the
"Lovely Ladies" campaign reveals a
lack of understanding on the OLD
BOY'S part concerning that objec
tion.
Must one be a sorority girl to
recognize the real "definition of the
term" loveliness? And is the soror
ity girl's definition the acme of
veracity?
The more disinterested the ob
server the more opportunity for the
rendition of an unbiased opinion.
A man's judgment is not hapipered
as is a woman's by such things as
jealous rivalry, reflected popularity,
Susie's larger allowance, Mamie's
superior attitude, Josie's K.A. sweet
ness; in short,, a man is not ruled
by the fear of how his vote for a
woman will affect him.
Furthermore, girls are lovely inso
far as they affect the opposite sex.
Let's not have women tell us what
they like (they do enough to us al
ready). Let the men do the electing
—and not from groups; from the
Stanford femininity en masse.
To Mr. Old Boy. that self-appoint
ed judge of judges of feminine love
liness —phooey!
Sincerely,

The Editor, Sir:
May I speak foi; the 800 graduates.
We pay our A.S.S.U. dues; many of
us have a genuine affection for
Stanford University; we feel inter
ested in its activities and welfare.
In short, we feel ourselves quite
definitely members of the student
body. We are not allowed to repre
sent Stanford on the athletic field or
the orator's forum; we are not al
lowed on Rally Committee or many
other of the activity committee;s we
have no class activities; ws are lim
ited in any living group activity;
and by the very length of time and
I he tryoutee system it is very un
likely that we will often hold any
position on any of the publications.
This situation we accept willingly,
realizing that there is usually a just
reason behind the limitations. Thus
we enter willingly into student pol
itics, the only extra-curricular field
left open to us. And it seems to me
most unjust to throw us out of this
last chance to enter into the affairs
of the student body of which we are
a part. To say that some of us are
uninterested is no reason as those
who are uninterested will neither
vote nor run for office. The same
holds true of those who have lost
all touch with student activities.

Therefore, may I ask that in the
spirit of fairness the undergraduates
will join with us in voting "No" to
the constitutional amendment, and
leave to those of us who are inter
ested in something else than cram
ming our only remaining extra
curricular activity.

DISTINCTIONS ARE BAD
The Editor, Sir:
It seems to me that the present
-division of the campus into hall and
row political factions in which the
members of each organization are
expected to vote for members of
their own group is rather undesir
able. Is it not more important that
we should have a competent man in
(he office rather than a row man if
we happen to belong to a fraternity,
or a hall man if we live in a hall?
I think that an effort should be
made to make the candidates, their
' purposes, and ideals better known to
| the campus as a whole. It would be
I an excellent idea if The Daily were
| to allow every candidate of student
t body president a column for one day,
j in which the candidate would air his
j views in the world in general and
' the campus in particular in case he
had any such ideas. And, if he has
inone, I think the campus might be
: interested in that, too.
Also, I think that the assembly in
which the candidates are presented
■ might be given more prominence.
I Couldn't we have an all-University
j assembly in the morning for this
! purpose?

It seems to me that the present
-division of the campus into hall and
row political factions in which the
members of each organization are
expected to vote for members of
their own group is rather undesir
able. Is it not more important that
we should have a competent man in
(he office rather than a row man if
we happen to belong to a fraternity,
or a hall man if we live in a hall?
I think that an effort should be
made to make the candidates, their
' purposes, and ideals better known to
| the campus as a whole. It would be
I an excellent idea if The Daily were
| to allow every candidate of student
t body president a column for one day,
j in which the candidate would air his
j views in the world in general and
' the campus in particular in case he
had any such ideas. And, if he has
inone, I think the campus might be

The OLD BOY'S supposedly scin

Must one be a sorority girl to
recognize the real "definition of the

The more disinterested the ob

A man's judgment is not hapipered
as is a woman's by such things as
jealous rivalry, reflected popularity,
Susie's larger allowance, Mamie's

by the fear of how his vote for a

Furthermore, girls are lovely inso

The Editor, Sir:
May I speak foi; the 800 graduates.
We pay our A.S.S.U. dues; many of
us have a genuine affection for
Stanford University; we feel inter
ested in its activities and welfare.
In short, we feel ourselves quite
definitely members of the student
body. We are not allowed to repre
sent Stanford on the athletic field or
the orator's forum; we are not al
lowed on Rally Committee or many
other of the activity committee;s we
have no class activities; ws are lim
ited in any living group activity;
and by the very length of time and
I he tryoutee system it is very un
likely that we will often hold any
position on any of the publications.
This situation we accept willingly,
realizing that there is usually a just
reason behind the limitations. Thus
we enter willingly into student pol
itics, the only extra-curricular field
left open to us. And it seems to me
most unjust to throw us out of this
last chance to enter into the affairs
of the student body of which we are
a part. To say that some of us are
uninterested is no reason as those
who are uninterested will neither
vote nor run for office. The same
holds true of those who have lost
all touch with student activities.

Therefore, may I ask that in the
spirit of fairness the undergraduates
will join with us in voting "No" to
the constitutional amendment, and
leave to those of us who are inter
ested in something else than cram
ming our only remaining extra
curricular activity.
