The problem of how to spend the
I spare moments i.s one thit has vexed
generations of men and women from
time immemorial. Hence the preva
lence ol such gems as: "How Doth
the Little Busy Bee Improve Each
Shining Hour," "A Rolling Stone
Gathers No Moss," and countless
others of equal merit —too platitudi
nous for even bad punning.
It is believed by some that how a
civilization spends its spare time is
the key to the cultural develop
ment of any people. Thus it is
pointed out: (1) that childhood (a
semi-sitvage or primitive state) is
) marked by such pastimes as jacks,
l or marbles, or baby-dolls; (2) that
1 frontier societies are marked by
! such necessary amusements as
; quilting-bees and knitting festivals;
I (3) that with the march of progress,
! things of the mind and the spirit
I occupy an increasingly large pro
portion of the individual's leisure
I time.
Now that introduction was long
but necessary. For the problem of
how te spend the spare moments
I has within comparatively recent
months injected itself rather forcibly
j upon the Farm community. More
! especially, it seems that the knitting
bug has struck the feminine half of
I Stanford, and struck it hard, leaving
| in its wake unpleasant memories
| and soured romances — impaled on
| the points of knitting needles.
Up at Whitman College — in the
j wilds of Walla Walla, Washington—
! we were first struck with the preva

lence of the knitting-bur. But after
ill, that was Walla Walla, where
"Ruggles of Keel Gap" could be
filmed, where life was hard, and
girls were motherly. But it is dis
tressing to find the leisure pursuits
of wilderness and frontier trans
ported to Stanford — where life
should be finer and nobler—and ul
least more sophisticated.
Despite the submersion of the
"500" in a tide of pulchritude and
paychecks, Stanford women are still
supposed to be of the upper crust—
mentally. But what can one think
when college-bred women—steeped
in all the culture and sophistication
that the traffic will bear—must break
forth with darn and knitting needles.
And they are brazen about it. Not
only is the vice practiced in the
sanctity of the boudoir, but in

plaeos of public assembly. If more
gainful occupation dots not take
precedence over knitting, at least it
would set m thai good taste would
dictate "No Knitting" in the pres
ence of a public speaker.
It is enough that women rouge
and titivate themselves in public;
that amply demonstrates their eman
cipation. But to go for darn and
knitting needles—it is not only to
boast of emancipation of the worst
sort, but to demonstrate a regret
able barrenness of spirit and mind.
