# Two World Marks Smashed at Fresno; Cards Take Fourth
## S.C. Captures West Coast Relays; Moore Ties Hurdle Record 
### Warren Breed 
In an evening of spectacular per
formance and smashed records
Stanford's depleted varsity came out
fourth bast in the college class, trail
ing U.S.C., U.C., and Fresno State
at the Fresno Relays Saturday night.
In addition to the toppling of a
flock of meet records, two new
world records were set up and one
tied. Tom Moore, Bear junior from
Petaluma, turned in <he best in
dividual performance in his world
record-equalling hurdle flight of 14.2
.seconds. The new world marks were
established by the Olympic Club's
medley relay team, anchored by
Norm Bright, and the U.S.C. 880-
yard sprint team.
Black man Missed
The Cards, dealt a mortal injury
by the absence of Captain A1 Black
man from two a relay teams, scored
26 1-7 points, chiefly in the weight
events. S.C., winning every relay
but the medley, was a landslide win
ner with 82% points.
The C'vrd missile-tossing trio of
Phil Levy, Jim Reynolds, and
Johnny Mottram beat out their old
Bear and Trojan rivals, although
they could not match sterling in
dividual performances by Gordy
Dunn and Moose Rowland.
Dunn, his Stanford competition
used up, hit his all-time top per
formance. He spun the discus 169
feet, exactly three feet behind the
world's record, after winning the
shot with one of his best puts slight
ly over 52 feet.
Rowland Wins Javelin
Rowland, the Fresno State idol,
whipped the javelin out 219 feet, 9
inches, the best throw on the Coast
this year, and one of the best ever
recorded by an American athlete.
Mot t ram's throw of 218 feet was
only good enough for a third, with
Ed Waterbury of the Club only a
lew inches behind Rowland.
Sammy Klopstock, while run
ning one of his best high hurdle
races, was shut out by a trio of
tliers with record intent â€” Tom
Moore and Johnny Wood of Cali
fornia nnd Ted Cope of S.C. in a
four-way blanket finish.
Moore's time of 14.2 tied Percy
Beard's accepted world's record. The
three following him to the tape all
broke the meet record, a showing
typical of the Relay's man-power
and class.
Dean Places
The other Redskin to score points
was Ray Dean in the 100-yard dash.
Dean pulled up third, right behind
Milton Holt of Fresno and George
Anderson, in a race that looked
faster than the official time of 9.5.
Sacramento, led by the speedball
Claude McWilliams, won the Junior
College class followed by L.A.J.C.,
and Compton, Bakersfield, S. F. Poly,
and Tulare finished in that order in
the high school division.
