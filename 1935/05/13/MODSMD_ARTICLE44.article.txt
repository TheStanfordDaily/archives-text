AND HE WASN'T
EVEN TRYING

Norm .Bright and Gordon Dunn,
j Stanford infeligibles, made a big day
[ ol Saturday's Fresno Relays.
Bright, after watching others
have the honors for three years
| while he played the hack-seat
role of an ineligible, finally en
joyed some of the glory that goes
( with being a great footracer. In
I the opening performance of the
| evening the red-headed distance
j man ran the anchor laps on •> med
i ley relay team that cracked a
| world's record by 10 seconds, and
I much of the credit for the new
• mark justly goes to Bright and his
4 minutes 17 seconds mile.
The valley crowd that witnessed
j the relays was gasping when Bright
i went into his last lap sprint that
| carried him to the tape 60 yards
j ahead of S.C.'s fine Benavidez. As a
; matter of fact, Bright was probably
! running considerably under his
j best. Three days before the meet he
; turned up with a bad case of sun
' burn and poison oak, both combin
ing poorly with track. It took two
I days of treatment to get him in
| shape to run at all.
Then, going into the last turn,
| when the spectators were wide
i eyed at the sprint he could show at
| the end of a fast mile, the great
j Norm wasn't really putting on the
i pressure at all, so the story goes.
"Get going, Norm,*' someone
i called from the sidelines. "Benny
I is catching up with you."
j "0.K.," answered Bright, non
i chalantly, "I'll take care of Beo
i ny," ? ; nd he whipped into the
| sprint that brought him to the
! tape in the fastest mile of the
! Coast track season.

i HE FIRST BROKE
' A DIVING BOARD

It was a big day for Slinger Dunn
! because he was the only double win-
I ner in the open class, and all before
| the home town fans.
i" To Fresno folks Stanford's great
! est discus thrower, now that he's
|.surpassing marks set by the late Eric
j Krenz, is somewhat of a famed fig-
I ure. They remember his prep days
,at Fresno High, and the time he
J broke the diving board out at the
' country club pool. Next to Walter
Marty, Fresno Is proudest, athlet-
I ically, of Slinger Dunn.
When Marty disappointed in the
high jump, Dunn's performances
became ail the more enjoyable.
In the afternoon, after playing
host at luncheon to Kenny Car
penter of U.S.C.. Ilerc Laborde
and other of his rivals in platter
, heaving, Dunn proceeded to set
the American mark for the year.
In fact, it was even announced
that "Slinger Dunn has just set a
new world's record of 1715 feet in
the discus." Measured, the win
ning toss proved to be approxi
mately K>9 feet, three short of the
mark.
His first place throw of 52 feet in
j the shot came as his last throw, and
j was one of his best of all time. If he
| can get into enough meets with the
j required officials present, Gordon
j Dunn is almost certain to have the
| discus record this season, and with
| it goes a $50 wager on the part of
i the Slinger's father. That is, if Sat-
I urday's bet still holds good.
