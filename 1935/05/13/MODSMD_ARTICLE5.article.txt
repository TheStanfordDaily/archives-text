# To Read Stage Hit Tomorrow
## 
### 
A dramatic reading of Robert
Sherwood's New York .stage hit,
"The Petrified Forest," will be given
by Mrs. Hugh Brown tomorrow night
in the Assembly Hall at 7:30 o'clock.
Under the auspices of ihe Commit
-1 tee on Public Exercises, the reading
will take the place of the usual
Tuesday evening lecture.
Mrs. Brown is well known in the
! community for her dramatic inter
pretations and has given a number
of readings on the campus in the
past. The play is melodramatic in
form, but is an extremely thought
ful attempt on the part of the drama
tist to symbolize present-day psy
chology as well.
Leslie Howard played the leading
role in the New York production,
that of Alan Squier, an intellectual.
