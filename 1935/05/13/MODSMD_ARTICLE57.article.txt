"IT'S A SMALL WORLD"
At the Stanford Theater
A decidedly different comedy. A
i girl and a lawyer, each driving a late
! model of "one of the low-priced
three," crash during a heavy rain in
\ the Bayou country of Louisiana â€”
and only one car can be recon
structed from
the two. Spencer
Tracy digs up a
forgotten .section
of the Napo
leonic code and
"gets possession
of the body" of
the girl (Wendy
Barry), whom we predict will be a
favorite of yours after this show.
The film's fun arises from a series
of small incidents involving dogs,
duck - hunting, hitch - hikers, and
' politicians, which are as original as
j they are humorous. Good sequence:
j Wendy Barry, changing her name to
Jasmine Lee so that the local jury
wouldn't convict a "fair blossom of
' Southern womanhood."
