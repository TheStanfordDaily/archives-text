# "BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN"
## 
### 
j Sequels are usually less effective
! than their precedents, but this film
refutes that rule. For in "The Bride
! of Frankenstein," although closely
! following the original, we find a
| development that makes this show

complete in itself. For the monster
: of Frankenstein almost acquires a
! soul. We are not so horrified as we
are moved to pity for this strange |
being that can find "no place in our j
world without changing God's plan." j
i The director sympathetically por
; trays the monster seeking for
, friendship with man, and failing,
looking for a mate of his own kind,
j When he fails here, too, and realizes
j the folly and futility of his own ex
istence, he has developed enough J
character to destroy the whole hor- ;
I rible scheme. Photography and I
technical work are unusual and the
i film genuinely entertaining, al
| though it did become extremely lu- j
; dicrous, in certain sequences, to see
i the man-killing monster acting coy
ciiicl sentimental.
—Brill
