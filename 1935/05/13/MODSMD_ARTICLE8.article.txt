# 'Yellow Jack' Draws Praise From Critic
## Scenes Presented Without Closing Curtain 
### Henry Brill 
i A typical campus audience came
! to Dramatic Council's presentation
of "Yellow Jack" last Friday eve
] ning with no illusions—they came
1 away impressed by what may mod
estly be called Stanford's most aus
picious and impressive dramatic
j production in five years. Acting, di
j rection, staging, and lighting were
i on an unusually high par and to
jgether form a complete justification
j of the University's plan to establish
I next year a full-fiedged School of
| I he Theater at Stanford.
"Yellow Jack," written by Sidney
Howard and Paul Do Kruif, is a
history of man's fight and final vic
tory over the dread yellow fever.
The play begins in 1929, when im
munization to the disease is just
about to be discovered, and moves
! backward to 1900 when Walter Reed
j in Cuba isolates the mosquito as the
J carrier of the disease and dramatic
ally fights to convince science of the
] correctness of his theories. The ac
! lion concludes in 1929 when the
! disease has been conquered and Dr.
j Reed is eulogized for making this
: possible.
Talents Combined
The play had some 35 scenes and
j Ihe curtain never closed on the pro
duction. Such an order called for
j unusual lighting, setting, and stage-
I craft—and the Stanford Assembly,
I with its barn-like equipment and
extra hard seats, was certainly an
] unauspicious locale for the attempt.
; But Director William Murray Tim
'< mons, Set-designer George An
dreini, and Stage-lighter Hart Pres
j ton combined their talents to present
! a truly outstanding performance.
| A few more rehearsals to achieve
I complete smoothness and greater
speed in lighting and set changes,
I and perhaps a single intermission to
| offset the inquisitorial abuse of the
assembly seats are the only major
! criticisms which can bo offered to
| the technical end of the production.
Lawry Outstanding
| In the entire cast of 30 there was
j n't one really weak characterization,
j and many of its members were mak-
I ing their first appearance on the
| stage. The most outstanding per-
I formance was that of Joe Lawry as
! the Irish Sergeant O'Hara. Lawry
I got every bit of comedy and effect
I possible out of his lines, and his dia
lect was a delight to hear. Najeeb
Halaby, Charles Cohen, and Rich-
I aid Paddock, the other three men
