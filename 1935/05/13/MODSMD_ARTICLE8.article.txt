# 'Yellow Jack' Draws Praise From Critic
## Scenes Presented Without Closing Curtain 
### Henry Brill 
i A typical campus audience came
! to Dramatic Council's presentation
of "Yellow Jack" last Friday eve
] ning with no illusions—they came
1 away impressed by what may mod
estly be called Stanford's most aus
picious and impressive dramatic
j production in five years. Acting, di
j rection, staging, and lighting were
i on an unusually high par and to
jgether form a complete justification
j of the University's plan to establish
I next year a full-fiedged School of
| I he Theater at Stanford.
"Yellow Jack," written by Sidney
Howard and Paul Do Kruif, is a
history of man's fight and final vic
tory over the dread yellow fever.
The play begins in 1929, when im
munization to the disease is just
about to be discovered, and moves
! backward to 1900 when Walter Reed
j in Cuba isolates the mosquito as the
J carrier of the disease and dramatic
ally fights to convince science of the
] correctness of his theories. The ac
! lion concludes in 1929 when the
! disease has been conquered and Dr.
j Reed is eulogized for making this
: possible.
Talents Combined
The play had some 35 scenes and
j Ihe curtain never closed on the pro
duction. Such an order called for
j unusual lighting, setting, and stage-
I craft—and the Stanford Assembly,
I with its barn-like equipment and
extra hard seats, was certainly an
] unauspicious locale for the attempt.
; But Director William Murray Tim
'< mons, Set-designer George An
dreini, and Stage-lighter Hart Pres
j ton combined their talents to present
! a truly outstanding performance.
| A few more rehearsals to achieve
I complete smoothness and greater
speed in lighting and set changes,
I and perhaps a single intermission to
| offset the inquisitorial abuse of the
assembly seats are the only major
! criticisms which can bo offered to
| the technical end of the production.
Lawry Outstanding
| In the entire cast of 30 there was
j n't one really weak characterization,
j and many of its members were mak-
I ing their first appearance on the
| stage. The most outstanding per-
I formance was that of Joe Lawry as
! the Irish Sergeant O'Hara. Lawry
I got every bit of comedy and effect
I possible out of his lines, and his dia
lect was a delight to hear. Najeeb
Halaby, Charles Cohen, and Rich-
I aid Paddock, the other three men
making up the quartet of buck pri
vates, were nearly as good. Their
comedy, together with that of Fred
Clark as the dumb rookie who re
turned from Havana only to have
"black beauty" take lunch off of his
arm, was the highlight of the play.
Frank O'Neill played the leading
role of Dr. Walter Reed. O'Neill
gave a strong and sincere perform
ance. But, in attempting to bring
out the full historical import of the
character he recited his lines in a
detached, semi-monotone to give
them force. The trick was succass
full in key speeches, but in many
places it slowed down the tempo and
became monotonous.
Brown Brilliant
Phil Brown, as the impetuous Dr.
Lazear, did a brilliant piece of act
ing. The force and earnestness of
his characterization was so convinc
ing that his later death became real
tragedy.
Kay Arthur, the one woman in the
cast, made every line of her small
part tell. She added all the color and
interest to the role which the play
wright meant*for it to impart to the
play. George Leavens as Stockpole
and Neal Berry and Jim Copp as
Harkness and Kraemer, were quite
good in their parts of medical ad
venturers.
Page Beckett, James Carroll, Dav
id Nusbickel, John McCracken, and
David Devlin all gave excellent
characterizations in varied and col
orful roles. Douglass McKellar, John
Partridge, Harold Connable, William
Blees, Robert Garred and Mervyn
Shoor were also good in smaller
roles. Other parts were adequately
handled by Curtis Barnes, William
Yeomans, Ernest 'Fanero, Harold
Snyder, Robert Boyd, Robert Sitkin,
and Walter Haluk. The large stage
crew is also to be congratulated for
its successfully handling of such dif
ficult and rapid changes as the play
called foi\
