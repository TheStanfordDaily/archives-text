# Retain ONE Student Body at Stanford
## 
### 
A student body, for Hit 1 most put t disinterested, goes to
the polls today to vote on tin amendment. Many will puss
ril ll by the voting steps, laugh at the people waiting in
line and keep right on going.
Two distinctly different minorities will, however, east
votes today. On the one hand is the short-sighted politic-id
group who are looking to this year's election alone, and
will attempt to put through an amendment to exclude
graduates from two oflices.
The other group are a few hundred enlightened stu
dents who see the lack of basic reasoning behind the
amendment and will go to the polls to vote NO. This edi
torial is intended to acquaint over two thousand students
with facts now only realized by these few hundred.
If today's amendment is not defeated, the present form
of student government at Stanford I'niversity will be
changed. According to the administration, if there is any
restriction upon any students, those discriminated against
have the power to set up an organization of their own
which the I niversily would have to recognize.
In voting on amendments, the long-time point of view
is the one to be considered; student government must look
ahead, not for one year, or two or three, but to constitu
tional forms that will function for many years.
.lust when the distinction between graduate and under
graduate at Stanford is finally being obliterated, along
comes a reactionary amendment that will only injure
everyone concerned. It litis been voted down twice before,
and it must be voted down again today!
