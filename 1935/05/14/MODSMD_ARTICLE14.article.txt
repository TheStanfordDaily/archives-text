# Plans for Ball Progress; Bid Sale Ends Tomorrow
## 
### 
With the sale of reserved bids to
the Senior Ball scheduled to end to
morrow, plans for the all-night
dance in Toyon lobby on Friday,
June 14, are rapidly progressing un
der the direction of a committee
headed by Stan Beaubaire.
Bids must be secured before 5
o'clock tomorrow at the A.S.S.U. of
fice, after which time any unclaimed
ones will be put on public sale to any
seniors who have paid class dues.
They are priced at $7.50.
A cigarette case of heavy red
grained leather will be the sou
venir favor presented to everyone

who attends the ball. Each case
will hear an embossed Stanford
seal. A regular dance program
with names of patrons, hall com
mittee members, and spaces for
dances will be placed inside of
! each cigarette case.
Definite plans for the lighting ef
fects and other decorations are be
ing formulated now. Choice of an
off-campus orchestra to furnish mu
si: has narrowed down to three pos
sible groups â€” Jimmy Grier, Dick
Jui'gens, or Orville Knapp. The or-
I ehestra which Ls finally selected will
t make a special trip to the campus
| for the one-night engagement.
