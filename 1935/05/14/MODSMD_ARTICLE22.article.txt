# DRAMA READING GIVEN TONIGHT
## Mrs. Hugh Brown To Give Sherwood Play Hit 
### 
"The Petrified Forest," a current
hit play by Robert Sherwood, will
be read tonight at 7:30 o'clock in the
Assembly Hall by Mrs. Hugh Brown,
noted interpreter of modern drama.
Sherwood, when lie wrote the
play, obviously intended a com
mentary on current living, but
modified the intensity of his at
tack. Glimpses of modern life are
interpreted to show that the cur
rent period is the end of epic
of living. Sherwood, through the
means of his characters, offers a
solution to the decay of the pe
riod, in philosophy. He .shows
that all people are becoming like
the dead wood in a petrified forest
without a new philosophy.
Leslie Howard took the lead in
the New York presentation as a
hitch hiker who appears at the Ari
zona-border barbecue stand, a
down and out poet and ex-writer.
A great conglomeration of charac
ters enter into the play, representa
tive of a border community. A Bol
shevik, American Legion enthusiast,
banker, college athlete who pumps
gasoline, and a reminiscent Indian
fighter are among the characters in
cluded. A kidnaping theme enters
the plot toward the close of the
drama, and results in a lather fan
tastic conclusion.
The play reading is taking the
place of the regular Tuesday evening
lecture, Mrs. Brown is well known
in San Francisco and Palo Alto for
readings, and has given several on
the campus previously.
