# Ex-Committee Votes $10,000 For New Hall
## No Specified Time Named For Debt Payment 
### 
Another step toward the early
construction for Stanford Memorial
Hall was taken Friday, when Ex
Committee voted the recommenda
tion that $10,000 be set aside for the
first payment on the new theater.
A spccW meeting was called by
A.S.S.U. President Marvic Kahn
because Comptroller Almon E.
Roth wanted to have assurance
that he could go ahead with plans â€¢
before he departed for the East.
No specified time for payment of
the $1.0,000 was named in the recom
mendation, but the date may be on
the completion of the structure,
which will probably be in the middle
of winter quarter next year.
Contracts Loan
The A.S.S.U., in order to pay off
its $325,000 share of the total cost of
$490,000, will contract a loan, which
present estimates state v/ill be paid
off in 19 years.
Money that students will use to
pay off the debt will come from the
quarterly-collected theater dollar
and a corresponding amount of
money from the profits of the Union.
Plans Going Ahead
Plans are going ahead rapidiy on
the building. Architects Bakewell
and Brown have been working on
the specifications for the past few
weeks and expect to have the plans
ready fairly soon.
Bidding for the smaller parts of
the contxacts should take place
shortly after the plans are com
pleted, according to Kahn, and ac
tual construction will start in Sep
tember.
