# Vote Held Today on Graduate Issue
## Campus To Decide Fate of Amendment At Special Election Eligibility of Graduates for Top Offices To Be Weighed At Law Steps Polls from 8:30 to 2 o'clock 
### BOB ADAMS 
A question which has been vexing campus politicians for the past
week will be defu\itely settled in the special election to be held today.
Polls will be open at the Law steps from 8:.'10 to 2 o'clock for members
of the student body to express their opinions on the question of whether
or not the A.S.S.U. constitution shall be flimended so as to bar graduates

â™¦ from holding the offices of president
and women's vice-president.
It will take a two-thirds majority
favorable vote to put the proposed
amendment into the constitution.
Unless the amendment wins this ap
proval today the constitution will
remain unchanged, permitting any
registered student to hold the two
top offices.
Following the closing of the polls
at 2 o'clock the votes will be pub
licly counted in Room 227.
Tlie proposed amendment which
| is to be placed before the voters
| today reads "V> follows: "One un
j dergraduate man shall be chosen
, at the regular May election by the
Association at large to be Presi
dent of this Association. One un
i dergraduate woman shall be
chosen at the May election by the
1 Association. Only undergraduate
members of this Association shall
be eligible to bold these positions."
| The proposed amendment, if ac
| ccpled, would replace Article 11,
i section 1, sub-section (a), which
j reads as follows: "One man shall be
| chosen at the regular May election
by the Association at large to be
j the President of this Association. One
j woman shall be chosen at the regu
lar May election by the Association
at large to be vice-president of this
; Association."

points out that the usual instruc
tions will be placed at the top of to
day's ballot and must be strictly
! followed so that votes will not be
