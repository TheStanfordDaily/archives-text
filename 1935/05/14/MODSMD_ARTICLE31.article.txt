### 
WASHINGTON, May 13 (A\
After six hours of snapping debate
in which Senator Long of Louisiana
characterized Postmaster General
Farley as the "high muckety-muck
of American political corruption,"
the Senate late today put off until
tomorrow a decision on the Louisi
anan's resolution for an investiga
tion of the Cabinet officer's official
conduct.
Democratic leaders predicted the
vote would be overwhelming against
an inquiry.
