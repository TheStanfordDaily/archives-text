# A 						Meager Audience Sees Stanford Dramatics at Its Best
## 
### 
Although proving to be "Stanford's most j
auspicious and impressive dramatic produc- j
(ion in five years," Drama Council's prcsen- 1
lalion of "Yellow Jack," realistic story of
man's triumph over the dreaded yellow lever, 1
attracted a meager and disappointing crowd ]
to the Farm's barn-like Assembly Hall last
Friday.
The less-lhan-avcrage attendance at the j
lies! play in live seasons forceablv prods an- ]
thorities toward the immediate ground-break
ing for the new theater. The success ol the j
aciual production, however, furnishes a coin- ;
plole justification of the t'niversity's plan to j
establish a full-fledged School of the Theater.
