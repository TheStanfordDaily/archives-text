# A 						Soap Box for Every Man

### 
San Francisco's own "Hvdc Park," equiva
lent of that famous spot in London, lias been
established by the Park Commission, and
soap-box orators within this area may de
claim upon any subject without molestation.
Thus San Francisco becomes another city
to take care of the vociferous radical in the
best way possible, by permitting him to blow
oil' steam to his heart's content, requiring
only that "he furnish his own soap box."
Many American cities have found by sad
experience that this is the only way to handle
the more loud-mouthed element. New York,
with squads of mounted police, has tried for
years to control it with tear gas and clubs,
breaking in on the tirades of radical orators
by force and attempting to disperse the au
dience. The net result of this procedure has
been only hard feeling, broken skulls, and
lesenlment on both sides.
On the opposite side is London, where for
years the more liberal viewpoint has been
taken. The orators shout with a maximum
of gusto, and are regarded with amusement
rather than alarm by the majority of their
listeners. No harm is done, and everyone
feels much belter about She whole thing.
San Francisco will reap much good from
this little ruling, and her example may well
be followed by other American cities where
the so-called "red scare" has been augmented
bv continual riots.
