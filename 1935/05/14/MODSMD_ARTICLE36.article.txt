# Fraternities' Big Opportunity Tonight
## 
### 
Outgoing members of the Interfratcrnily
Giuueil will consider candidates tonight for
I In* position of president of their legislative
body of the How. Along with the election, the
group will analxze rushing rules and the pro
posed abolition of Hell Week.
Tonight's meeting olTers an opportunity to
pill the fraternities on an even more substan
tial footing in the I niversitv set-up and to
prohibit the making of blunders that have
marred the progress of the (Weeks on the
earn fms.
Hy squarely facing the ban under consid
eration to do awav with the harmful tactics
accompanying the pre-initialion week, the
Mow can combat the destructive criticism that
has pelted them the nation over. By getting
Hie rather obstreperous opponents into line,
I lie fraternities can quiet opponents of the
heckling type who denounce them for their
distracting scholastic influence.
By taking a definite, plausible, and feasible
stand on next year's rushing, the How's rep
resentatives can avoid any such calamity that
befell the houses and the fraternity-minded
freshmen three years ago in the disabling

postponement ol' rushing privileges.
So tomorrow's election of a Jiew council
chairman will l>c> merely one of three concerns
oi the Creeks, the utiler two rushing and
Hell Week heing of equal importance.
