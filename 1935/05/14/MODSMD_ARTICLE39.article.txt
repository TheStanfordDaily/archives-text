# WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE NEW DEAL?

### CROMPTON BANGS, Jr 
RELIEF
NEW YORK, May 7. —Everybody wants economic
security. Thai's why we work. That's why some try
to save for a rainy day. But unfortunately there has
never been a time when everybody had a job. Lately
we have had more jobless than ever before. Relief
workers and others close to them will tell you that
unemployment is THE problem of the nation. More
than ever the loss of a job is feared; so it. oncoming
ojd age.
When FJR. took ollice over two yews ago there
were about 12.(10(1,(100 unemployed. Private and
local charity had just about broken down uuder
the strain. The federal government had to step in
and did. It will probably be In the relief business
for good, no matter how good times get. Eveu
today, with business definitely on the upgrade,
we have 10,(100,000 jobless and 22,000.000 on relief.
This is partly <ui emergency, partly a permanent
policy. Let's see why.
Ten years ago when Undersecretary Tugwell was
still a Columbia prof, he wrote a thesis called "Obso
lescence Unemployment." It was a good piece of work
but passed practically unnoticed. His argument was
that when a man of 45 or over loses his job he's likely to
lose it for good. Industry getting faster all the time
with more and more machinery wants younger men.
What with the population getting near stability, with a
larger and larger proportion of people over 45, un
employment—at least for the oldsters —is likely to be
a permanent proposition.
Neither the New Dealers nor the Old Dealers
have said much about this. It's pretty poor political
ammunition. But we ought to realize we are going
to have at least four millions jobless and ten mil
lion on soune kind of relief for a long time yet. With
that in mind let's see how relief has been handled
"jid what results it has produced.
RELIEF METHODS
There are two kinds of relief: (1) the dolt; (2)
work relief. The dole is much cheaper, but work re
lief is much better for the public morale. So far the
United States has tried both kinds. The CWA took
three million jobless through the first New Deal winter
at a cost of $400,000,000. A pretense of work was
made, such as raking leaves, digging a hole and then
filling it up, etc., but that was as far as it went.
Next year a half-federal, half-state system, the
FERA, was set up. States and localities were supposed
to contribute as much of their share as possible. Some
did, many more didn't. Work relief and the dole are
both used, but in large cities the handout predom
inates. This is the system we are now operating under.
Soon the five billion dollar work relief will supplant
it; still it will probably be a horse of the same color.
FERA is run from Washington by Harry Hopkins,
professional social worker, who has the final say-so.
Each state has Its own relief administrator and organi
zation. It must supply its share of the money used in
order to get the federal cash. Governors who haven't
done this have found Mr. Hopkins a tough customer
who is always right, or rather, can never be wrong (as
far as he is concerned). That gives you a rough idea
of how the .system is organized.
Tomorrow we look at. an example of how it works.

lescence Unemployment." It was a good piece of work
but passed practically unnoticed. His argument was
that when a man of 45 or over loses his job he's likely to
lose it for good. Industry getting faster all the time
with more and more machinery wants younger men.
What with the population getting near stability, with a
larger and larger proportion of people over 45, un
employment—at least for the oldsters —is likely to be
a permanent proposition.
Neither the New Dealers nor the Old Dealers
have said much about this. It's pretty poor political
ammunition. But we ought to realize we are going
to have at least four millions jobless and ten mil
lion on soune kind of relief for a long time yet. With
that in mind let's see how relief has been handled
"jid what results it has produced.
RELIEF METHODS
There are two kinds of relief: (1) the dolt; (2)
work relief. The dole is much cheaper, but work re
lief is much better for the public morale. So far the
United States has tried both kinds. The CWA took
three million jobless through the first New Deal winter
at a cost of $400,000,000. A pretense of work was
made, such as raking leaves, digging a hole and then
filling it up, etc., but that was as far as it went.
Next year a half-federal, half-state system, the
FERA, was set up. States and localities were supposed
to contribute as much of their share as possible. Some
did, many more didn't. Work relief and the dole are
both used, but in large cities the handout predom
inates. This is the system we are now operating under.
Soon the five billion dollar work relief will supplant
it; still it will probably be a horse of the same color.
FERA is run from Washington by Harry Hopkins,
professional social worker, who has the final say-so.
Each state has Its own relief administrator and organi
zation. It must supply its share of the money used in
order to get the federal cash. Governors who haven't
done this have found Mr. Hopkins a tough customer
who is always right, or rather, can never be wrong (as
far as he is concerned). That gives you a rough idea
of how the .system is organized.
Tomorrow we look at. an example of how it works.

NEW YORK, May 7. —Everybody wants economic
security. Thai's why we work. That's why some try
to save for a rainy day. But unfortunately there has
never been a time when everybody had a job. Lately
we have had more jobless than ever before. Relief
workers and others close to them will tell you that
unemployment is THE problem of the nation. More
than ever the loss of a job is feared; so it. oncoming
ojd age.
When FJR. took ollice over two yews ago there
were about 12.(10(1,(100 unemployed. Private and
local charity had just about broken down uuder
the strain. The federal government had to step in
and did. It will probably be In the relief business
for good, no matter how good times get. Eveu
today, with business definitely on the upgrade,
we have 10,(100,000 jobless and 22,000.000 on relief.
This is partly <ui emergency, partly a permanent
policy. Let's see why.
