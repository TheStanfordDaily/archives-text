# BULL SESSION
## SECOND ANNUAL LETTER HOME 
### 
Dear Mother;
This—like all other letters in our
family—is a chain letter; so when
you finish it, pass it on to Dad, little
brother, little sister, the maid, and
then to Sandy—the Scotch terrier
next door. Of course, I'm not asking
you to "send-a-dime," but it would
help.
Thought you might like to know
that it is spring again. And that
means more auto wrecks. One young
man's fancy is now turning over on
a hospital bed.
But turning from the morbid
to the ridiculous, there's a campus
election today. There's bunch of
guys here trying to keep graduates
out of the student body presidency.
They figure that when a man knows
enough to be a good prexy, he knows
too much. Which, if you asked me,
is a pretty funny way of looking at
things.
Say the gals are up in knitting
needles over what I said about wast
ing college time on wool. But all the
same I hope you don't send Ruthie
to Stanford to learn how to knit.
Gawd, if my sister turns out to be
a knitter, there'll be homicide in
the family. For knithood is a fate
worse, far worse than death. Yes, I
think I'd rather have her be a
clubwoman than a knitter.
As you probably saw in the pa
pers, the court said that there were
n't any speed laws in California. So
I guess that means Stanford has
seceded ltOm the Union .of States.
For we have 'em here with a ven
geance. And the lule is: You're
guilty until you can prove th<f
cop is a liar. And nobody can.; Gordy

|is such a nice guy. And I'll bet he
j nicks that kid Nightingale when
j Nightingale's head is well enough to
take another rap.
Sir Josiah Stamp, the English
| knight who caused all that trouhle
I had in Econ 55 and 56, is coming to
talk here tomorrow. And he better
ibe careful what he says, and had
, better be pretty well guarded, for
some of the boys are awful bitter on
i the subject. Course, there's no use
| trying to get Stamp, cause there's
lots more where he came from.
Well, things are about the same
1 here as always: the mosquitoes are
! biting something fierce; DeKruif got
| "Yellowjack," but that just reduced
; the competition for musca culicidae
1 (common Stanford mosquito),
i They're having another one of those
I "popularity contests" which satisfy
j no-one except dance chairmen and
| the newspapers; and darned if they
aren't having a guy by the name of
; Ran Wilde to play for the dance.
That's one pleasure that Oscar was
; spared.
|
Well, the Union is still flying the
i Jolly Roger and I must quit too.

Dear Mother;
This—like all other letters in our
family—is a chain letter; so when
you finish it, pass it on to Dad, little
brother, little sister, the maid, and
then to Sandy—the Scotch terrier
next door. Of course, I'm not asking
you to "send-a-dime," but it would
help.
Thought you might like to know
that it is spring again. And that
means more auto wrecks. One young
man's fancy is now turning over on
a hospital bed.
But turning from the morbid
to the ridiculous, there's a campus
election today. There's bunch of
guys here trying to keep graduates
out of the student body presidency.
They figure that when a man knows
enough to be a good prexy, he knows
too much. Which, if you asked me,
is a pretty funny way of looking at
things.
Say the gals are up in knitting
needles over what I said about wast
ing college time on wool. But all the
same I hope you don't send Ruthie
to Stanford to learn how to knit.
Gawd, if my sister turns out to be
a knitter, there'll be homicide in
the family. For knithood is a fate
worse, far worse than death. Yes, I
think I'd rather have her be a
clubwoman than a knitter.
As you probably saw in the pa
pers, the court said that there were
n't any speed laws in California. So
I guess that means Stanford has
seceded ltOm the Union .of States.
For we have 'em here with a ven
geance. And the lule is: You're
guilty until you can prove th<f
cop is a liar. And nobody can.; Gordy

|is such a nice guy. And I'll bet he
j nicks that kid Nightingale when
j Nightingale's head is well enough to
take another rap.
