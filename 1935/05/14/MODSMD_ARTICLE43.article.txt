"NAUGHTY MARIETTA"
At the St-'iifoid Theater
Victor Herbert remains charming
and delightful even alter repetition
that would kill lesser works within
a week. So, in "Naughty Marietta"
you'll find yourself thrilling to such
well-worn tunes as 'Ah, Sweet
Mystery of Life" and "I'm Falling
in Love." Van
Dyke's flirect
in g , Jeannette
McDonald and
Nelson Eddy in
leading' voc a 1
roles, and Frank
Morgan, as
usual, stealing
acting honor.', contribute largely to
the film's success. The production
is colorful and romantically senti
mental, and so convincingly done
that realism isn't missed. The plot
is typical 1910 musical-comedy. The
heroine runs away from a displeas
ing matrimonial match at Versailles
and comes to New Orleans, where
she meets her rough and ready sol
dier lover. At last, her rank as a
princess is discovered, and she's to
be taken home—but the hero ap
pears just in the nick of time and
rides off with her into the wilder
ness—close-up of a duet song on a
big, white hurst;. Sounds si)Jy, but
you will applaud it.
"The Florentine Dagger," a mys
tery by Ben Hecht, is ai.so on the
program. It's a good film, but makes
the program entirely too long—and
it's badly outshinad by the main fea
ture.
