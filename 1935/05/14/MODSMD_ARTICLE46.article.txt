# CAMPUS OPINION
## MORE ON ASSEMBLY 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
The suggestion by Bill Haiford
that we have an all-University as
sembly in order to present to the
students the candidates in the com
ing A.S.S.U. election is one worthy
of great commendation and further
support. The office of student body
president has reached the status of
something elusive and intangible,
with most students knowing there is
such an office, but wilh very few
t-ineerely interested, or even know
ing wlkj has the responsibility of the
office.
ft was the desire of those design
ing the constitution and creating the
position of A.S.S.U. president that he
should be democratically chosen as a
true representative of the students
to administer their affairs. The ideal
has degenerated, and in the years
past we have been presented with a
machine product.
You may say that this cry for truly
representative student body officers
i> as old as elections themselves, and
that the building of a machine is in
evitable, granted that there is a tinge
of the inevitable in the political ma
chine. However, there is nothing in
evitable in the present lethargy of
student interest in elections, and 1
wish to support Mr. Halford's sug
gestion for an all-University as
sembly as a first step toward the re
vival of student interest, and thus
bring to office a president who is
something more than a name to the
general student body.
Sincerely,
Harry Le Claire
