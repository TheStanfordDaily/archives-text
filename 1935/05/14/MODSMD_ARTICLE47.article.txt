# WOMEN UNQUALIFIED?
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
II was readily apparent Thursday
that an unusual means of selecting
the long-heralded "Loveliest Girls"
has been vised; the living groups
were too evenly represented.
It seems to me, and inquiries have
indicated that I am not alone in my
beliefs, that a woman's vote is quite
irrelevant and unqualified in cases
of this type, and that if Chappie so
chooses to conduct its selections, the
methods used should be mentioned
in the magazine. It is bad enough to
have the average Stanford woman at
the level she occupies in loveliness,
but must we fairly scream to out
siders about our prominent defi
ciency.
A poor selection of "Lovely
Ladies" was .made, and either the
Chappie staff or Stanford women are
going to lose some reputation.
Sincerely,
P. M. K.
