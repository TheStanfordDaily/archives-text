# THE 						LAST GRADUATE
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
The proposed amendment to for
bid graduate students from holding
the offices of president and vice
president of the A.S.S.U. is not only
unsound but also "stinks of politics,"
a.s Marvie Kalin said in Ex Com
mittee meeting. The amendment is
supported by a selfish group who,
not considering the welfare of the
A.S.S.U. at all, seek in this manner
to prevent the election of a certain
hall man who will be considered in
the hall caucus tonight. These poli
ticians care nothing about the merits
of the matter at all.
Unfortunately, some other stu
dents, especially underclassmen who
think that the undergraduates should
be governed by undergraduates,
have been won over by these politi
cians. These other students fail to
realize that the graduate students
comprise over one-fourth of the stu
dent body and pay their student
body fees just like undergraduates.
They also fail to realize that the
graduates are quite capable of with
drawing from the A.S.S.U. if this
amendment should pass; such a
withdrawal would benefit the grad
uates who could thus escape the in
creasing student body foes, but it
would prove disastrous for the A.S.
S.U., especially from the financial
point of view. The new theater
might be indefinitely postponed; the
Daily would be crippled; and stu
dent dramatics and debating would
ufier. The threat of the graduates
to withdraw is no idle threat; many
of them have desired such a step for
a long time.
Moreover, these other students
supporting the amendment fail to
realize the fact that graduate stu
dents are more likely to prove
capable executives than undergrad
uates. Any attempted distinction
between a senior and a graduate is
unsound. Several of our best stu
dent body presidents have been
graduates. It seems most unwise,

then, to exclude graduates from
such offices.
A vote for the proposed amend
ment is a vote for the aims of selfish
politicians and a vote for the dis
tinction of the A.S.S.U. All thinking
students know this; they should
showing it by voting "No" on the
amendment.
Yours very truly,
Richard W. Dickenson
