# WINNERS MUST BE RECORD-BREAKERS IN SATURDAY MEET
## Coast Tracksters To Vie In Intercollegiates Here 
### Warren Breed 
Stanford's going to see a track
meet- Saturday—a meet where the
winner in almost every event will
have to come close to the Pacific
Coast record—the California Inter
collegiates with U.S.C., Stanford,
U.C., and U.C.L.A. competing.
At least three-fourths oi the hold
ers of the best times reeoided in the
Fresno Relays Saturday will be
here. And these times are not to be
sniffed at, for the Fresno perform
ances were shown to be superior to
both the Drake and Penn Relays.
May Upset Bears
Dink Templeton's Cardinals, who
took things easy yesterday after
noon at practice, will be in a good
position to upset California's Bears
and sneak into second, place behind
Troy for team honors. Captain A1
Blackman and Humbert Smith may
be able to compete and the fellow
who beat Jim Reynolds, Phil Levy,
and Johnny Mottram will not be
able to enter.
Blackman was out in a sweat suit
yesterday and reported, "Sure I'm
going to run Saturday." He took a
light workout in the stadium.
Klopstack's Chances Oood
Sammy Klopstoek, who went
without a point for the first meet
he's been in for two years Saturday
night, will be headed for a double
victory in both hurdles. He will face
again his old pals Moore, Cope, and
Wood, but plans to take "better than
a fourth."
Just as Klopstoek will be counted
on to win hoth races, Reynolds,
Levy, and Mottram are favored to
cop 15 points in the weights.
Reynolds Counted On
Reynolds is the surest of winning,
as he has developed into a consist
ent 51-foot man. Mottram in the
fast two weeks has shown his su
periority over Big Meet conquerors
Fitzgerald and Fink with two tosses
of over 213 feet.
Then there will be the return of
Smith in the high jump, an event
which can be won at 6.3, which a
month ago would have been gravy
for the Card backyard leaper.
