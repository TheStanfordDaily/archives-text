## Professor Rogers Speaks On Precious Stones 
### 
Professor Austin Flint Rogers,
Stanford University mineralogist,
spoke over station KGO last evening
on the weekly radio hour on the
subject, "Precious Stones." Profes
sor Rogers has been connected with
the Stanford faculty for the past 30
years and has developed in that pe
riod the nucleus of a collection of
precious and semi-precious stones.
Professor Rogers, pointed out that
in the discovery of new minerals,
California has had her .share. One
of these is a germ mineral found in
1907 in San Benito County and
named therefore benitoite. This is a
beautiful blue stone somewhat re
sembling a sapphire but is of en
tirely different composition and has
never been found in any locality
other than the original one.
Of tlie five precious stones
which Professor Rogers considered
in his lecture he believes the opal
the most unique. Precious opal
is one of the few gems which can
not be imitated and differs from
other gems in that its colors are
not due to pigments but are pro
duced by the action of light on
exceedingly thin films within the
mineral. The opal is found mostly
in Australian desert regions in
sandstones and ironstones.
Professor Rogers also discussed
the emerald, ruby, sapphire, and dia
mond in his talk. In referring to the
diamond as the precious stone par
excellence he noted that while most
diamonds are colorless, colored ones
are also known. Diamonds were dis
covered in Brazil and following this
they were found near Orange River
in Africa, the result being the fam
ous Kimberly diamond mines.
