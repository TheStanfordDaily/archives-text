# CANDIDATES SHOULD SPEAK

### 
The Editor, Sir:
If student government is ever go
ing to raise itself out of the present
political Hall vs. Row muck, it is
imperative that candidates for A.S.
S.U. presidency be brought out into
the open and that they be expected
to officially state before the student
body the grounds on which they ask
our interest and support.
Such action would at least be an
approach to a more intelligent po
litical relationship and attitude
toward student government.
