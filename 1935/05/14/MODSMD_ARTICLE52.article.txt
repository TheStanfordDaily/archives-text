I WATCH FOK WAIJ,
iin

What with such ace performers as
| George Anderson, Norm Bright,
i Johnny McCarthy, and Torn Moore,
there were plenty of stellar perform
ers among the 600 participants that
went unnoticed during the course of
the Fresno Relays.
! One of those unsung roles was
i played by Johnny Wall, the San
j Francisco University distance run
| ner who took up an Olympic Club
! jersey when his alma mater closed
! a week or so ago. Last Saturday
night the Don soph proved himself to
ibe one of the Coast's finest pros
j pects, a position which he practically
i cinched at the P.A.A. meet two
j weeks ago when he followed Norm
| Bright by a few yards in a 4 min
| utes 17 seconds mile.

The opening event of the evening,
, the medley relay, shortly developed
into a duel between the Olympic
Club and the Trojans. Les Whistler
of the Club stayed within a yard of
the peerless Johnny McCarthy
throughout the quarter; but Fred
Walts had to tangle whh the Coast's
best half miler, and no one yet has
1 matched Tex Bush's kick on the
j home stretch. The result was that
the Trojans had an 9 or 10-yard lead
on the Winged "O" when Wall took
|the baton.
| The anticipated meeting of two
4:17 milers, Bright and Benavidez,
i was fading, the U.S.C. margin
! seemed so secure, until Wall settled
j down to overtaking Cartwright, a
I distance man of no mean repute. By
! the end of the first lap the margin
j had been cut noticeably. When the
| two came by for the last lap, Wall
I was right behind Cartwright. fPn
\ the tar side the Club runner moved
| by, and put on a burst of speed that
I gave Bright a 15-yard lead, and com
! pleted a three laps which was surely
, worthy of world's record relay.
Later, in the two-mile relay, Wall
■ came back with another exhibition
I of gritty running, making it possible
> for Bright to press Bush of the Tro
jans in the final half-mile. Next year
j he should be right with any col
| legiate miler on the Coast.

NICKING THE DIMES
WON BY MOORE

Sammy Klop.slock had faced the
impossible lor so many weeks ixi a
! row and had come through with fiy
j ing colors that the fourth place in
; the special 120-yard high hurdles
| race at first was a bit of a disap
pointment to the Stanford fans.
1 Klopstock had shown his heels ear
i lier in the season to every one of
I the three men who placed ahead of
I him in that a ace.
On afterthought the fourth place
i merely emphasized the tremendous
hazards' of the 120-yard highs,
j Hurdlers training by knoc king dimes
! off the barriers became plausible in
i Saturday's race. Against 14.4 men
j like Tom Moore, Phil Cope, and
! Johnny Wood, the slightest slip
i means everything.
Klopstock had the misfortune of
; making that slight, mistake, and the
j fourth place resulted. There were
j three false starts. They say Sammy
was headed for a world's record on
' the second. When they finally did
i get away Sammy was in the ruck.
| He knocked the first three hurdles,
j and found the others going away.
I When he started to press he tied up
|. slightly, and came down off balance.
He was hopelessly behind at the sev-
I enth barrier. But timber-toppers
! Mooie, Cope, and Wood will all be
I around Saturday for the intercol
' legiates, and a fourth place has every
j chance of becoming a first, if Sammy
} can knock off the dimes and not
j nick his big toe.
