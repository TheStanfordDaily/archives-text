Coming from behind with a four
run rally in the sixth, the Breakers'
intramural softball team defeated
the Betas yesterday 9 to 8. for the
championship of League VI. The
game was a play-01l of last week's

was called the third, with the score
4 to 1 in favor of the Betas.

for the Row nine in the first three
innings, and five runs in the fourth
