# GRID SCRIMMAGE BRINGS INJURY TO MOSCRIP, MULLER
## 
### 
Last Thursday's football scrim
| mage session which Ernie Nevers has
| .since called "the best we've had in
| years" left its mark on the partici
| pants. Monk Moscrip, ace end, em
j trged with a broken thumb and
I wrenched arm; Center Wes Midler
I suffered a neck injury; many a play
er spent a painful week-end with leg
' and body bruises.
Moscrip's injury, the only serious
j one of the lot, will probably keep
him <41 the practice fitdd for at least
two weeks, perhaps the rest of the
quarter. In the latter event Monk's
next scrimmage will not be until
: next fall.
Johnny Reisner and Bones Ham
: ilton who were off the practice lot
last week with injuries returned to
; work Monday both resuming their
I jobs on Tiny Thornhill's first-string
j squad.
