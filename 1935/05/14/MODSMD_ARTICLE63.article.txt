WARSAW, May 13 '(/P).â€” Huge
groups of devoted Poles stood weep

i bulletins of the death of Marshal

: spread that the dictator had left a
political will to guide the destiny of
his nation.
Mme. Alexandra Pilsudski, the

"unsatisfactory," physicians said.
She had tired herself out during
Pilsudski's long illness.
