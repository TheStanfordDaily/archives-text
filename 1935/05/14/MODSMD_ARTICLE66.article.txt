# Encina Barbers Recount Wild Tales of Freshmen
## 
### JOHN McClelland 
Barber-shop talk usually runs to
horse racing, politics, and baseball,
but in Encina's shaving parlor where
a good generation of freshmen have
dropped their locks, lurid accounts
of tom-foolery masterpieces are the
most frequent accompaniments of
latherings and snippings.
Often the Encina barbers tell of
the frosh who placed an order with
a fellow student for a dozen abalone
guns, which, the inventor claimed,
could knock off the shell, clean, and
slice an and wind up by
putting it in a paper bag—all in one
shooting. He wanted to take the
dozen guns and go into the business
commercially.
Tale of Sponger
Now famous is the tale of the
sponging Swede who spent a quar
ter at Stanford for nothing. He
talked his way into credit on his
board and room, managed to bor
row other necessities, and climaxed
his stay by borrowing a car, a tux
edo, and somebody's girl, and going
to the city, where he argued an or
chestra leader into letting him have
a table for nothing. Shortly after
he left, leaving no future address.
The story of the longest sentence
ever meted out by Encina sponsors
concerns a half dozen freshmen who
one evening threw three dozen eggs
through the window into a sponsor's
meeting. The one culprit caught was
sentenced to 180 hours of work at
the Convalescent Home—22 eight
hour days. But his pals confessed
and the sentence was divided.

The barbers even remember baek
as far as the days when Stanford
had a trolley line, and recount the
tale of the time when the pole of
the little electric car was pulled
down and let bounce until it hit the
overhead wire and blew out every
transformer on the campus, leaving
the Farm in total darkness for the
night.
Every year brings new frosh with
new ideas, or ideas that to them are
new. And sponsors bear the brunt
of most pranks. Fire hoses over tran
somes, horses carried to the third
floor, whistles placed on steam pipes,
waterbags, stink-bombs, and can
non crackers—all these and others
yearly furnish fun for freshmen,
tales for barbers, exasperation for
sponsors, and workers for the Con
valescent Home gardeners.
