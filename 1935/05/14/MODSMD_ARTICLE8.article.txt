# BONUS SUPPORT ADMITS DEFEAT OF PATMAN BILL
## Leaders Call Conferences To Decide Moves for Future Legislation 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 13 (/]').—ln
j virtual concession of defeat of the
1 Patman bill by the veto route, cash
I bonus forces went into a huddle to
j night to decide upon future strategy
for getting legislation at this session
! of Congress.
The conference was called by
i Senator Thomas of Oklahoma, Pat
! man bill leader in the Senate, when
; the week-end bombardment of ora
tory and telegrams failed to break
I down White House and Senate bar
riers against the inflationary bill.
Defeat Conceded
Even the strongest supporters of
j the Patman bill conceded that, it
faced a certain at the White
' House and that there appeared little
hope of over-riding the veto in the
| Senate. Administration leaders in
j the Senate count on at least 35 votes
| to sustain a veto, whereas 33 arc
| necessary.
Thomas invited to tonight's meet
: ing Representative Wright Patman
j of Texas, House author of the bill,
] representatives of the veterans' or
! ganizations and other Senators.
Thomas said he expected to with
-1 draw tomorrow his reconsideration
| motion that has been holding the
! Patman bill in the Senate and let
! it go to the White House. Final de
i cision on that parliamentary move
: was postponed, however, pending
the approval of the conference to
night.
Vinson Bill
Republican leaders were urging
that if the Patman bill were killed,
I the Vinson cash payment plan ad
! vanced by the American Legion
| should be pushed forward. Infia
| tionary forces, however, were not
| willing to go along on that proposi
j tion.
It was regarded by informed Sen
i ators as more likely that if the veto
j should be sustained, the new drive
I would come on a cash payment bill
I providing a series of alternate meth
i ods of financing, under which Presi
j dent Roosevelt could choose between
j issuing new currency or raising the
i money from other sources.
Telegrams Decrease
Administratoin leaders, mean
while, contended that the veto on
the Patman bill would end the bonus
Issue for this session and that no fur
ther compromises would be offered.
» The chief executive found 40,500
telegrams favoring the Patman bill
by a ratio of about 8 to 1 on his
desk, but went ahead with prepara
tions to veto the measure imme
diately it reaches him.
There seemed to be a marked let
up in the volume of the telegrams
| today.
