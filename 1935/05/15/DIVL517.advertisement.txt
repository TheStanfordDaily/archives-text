BEST FOR THE WIDE OPEN SPACES ...
When the Stanford maid and her swain
tiptoed through the tulips on Sunday pic
nics in 1893, their little basket wasn't
complete, because AUTEN'S wasn't in ex
istence then, to supply the thirst quench
ers.
Now the maid and her swain buy their
palate satisfiers at AUTEN'S for all the
picnics and other noteworthy occasions.
Provide relaxation and prolong enjoyment.
