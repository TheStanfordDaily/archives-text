A world of outmoded ideas which
should be sacrificed in order to make
way for the philosophy of the fu
ture —this is "The Petrified Forest"
of contemporary life which Robert
Sherwood presents in his powerful
play, read last night in the Assembly
Hall by Mrs. Hugh Brown.
Almost too insistent in pointing
his moral, Sherwood puts into the
mouth of Alan Squier, an intellec
tual and the personification of the
dead era, the bitter realization of
outlived usefulness. It is only then
Squier sacrifices his life in order
that Gabrielle, young artist-waitress
who represents the potentialities of
the future, may fulfill her promise,
that Sherwood comes near the
ridiculous.
Mrs. Brown's interpretation of the
play was well received by the audi
ence, sympathetic, and competent.
