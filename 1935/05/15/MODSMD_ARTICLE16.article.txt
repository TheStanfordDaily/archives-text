i Student government has never
claimed the real interest and sup
port of the student body because it
has not accepted the responsibility of
student body leadership.
To most of us, student government
has been a question of the strength
of purely political machinery -
highly distateful to many of us who
are sincerely interested in a more in
telligent approach to our real inter
ests and problems through the lead
ership of student government.
We must break dgwn the artifi
ciality of student-faculty relation
ships. We must develop an attitude
! of co-operation rather than opposi
tion of interest between student and
faculty We must recognize and en
courage student opinion. We must
reduce the isolation and antagonism
that exists between "Hall" and
"Row.' That problem must be met
by a more wholesome attitude with
in student government itself, and a
more wholesome relationship to the
entile student body rather than to a
political faction.
I do not believe that those cm
| bedded in the traditional political
; machinery approach student govern
ment with either that interest or
that sense of responsibility.
J I promise a student government
j that will accept the responsibility of
leadership, and will offer an intelli
i gent interest and response to stu
| dent opinion rather than to political
machinery.
I am convinced that a change in
i attitude is necessary, worthwhile,
| and wholly possible.
On these grounds I submit my
i candidacy for the presidency of the
i A.S.S.U.
