# Students Crush Amendment By Large Majority
## 709 Votes of Total Are Against Proposal; 183 Support Measure BALLOTS THROWN OUT More Interest Shown Than In Last Election 
### Bob Adams 
j A completely overwhelming ma
, jority sent the proposed amendment
to the A.S.S.U. constitution down to
1 defeat in yesterday's special election.
The measure, designed to amend the
' constitution in such a way that grad
: uate students would be unable to
( hold the two top offices, was defeated
by more than a two-thirds majority
| of the votes cast.
Over 900 Votes Cast
Considerably more interest was
shown in the outcome of this issue as
I compared with that of the proposed
I amendments voted on several weeks
| ago. A total of 943 votes were cast at
i yesterday's polls. This, however, is
, only about 28 per cent of the eligible
i voters.
Of the votes cast, the amend
ment received only 183 votes in
its support. Votes against the
proposition amounted to 70:>.
Fifty-one votes were thrown out
because they were not marked ui
ink in conformance with election
! rules.
The definite defeat of the amend
ment once more insures to graduate
! students the right to hold either the
A.S.S.U. presidency or the women's
vice-presidency. The proposed meas
! ure would have barred them from
j those offices.
Little Support Given
The rejection of the amendment is
:in accordance with the (expressed
i opinions of the present student body
leaders and the administration. It
| would seem apparent from the small
1 number of votes registered in favor
of the proposal that it had little sup
! port outside the group which spon
; sored the original petition, putting it
i before Ex Committee last week and
1 making necessary the special poll
j yesterday.
