# Last Day For Reserved Bids
## 
### 
Any reserved bids for the Senior
Ball which are not purchased by 5
o'clock this afternoon at the A.S.S.U.
office will be placed on public sale
to seniors who have paid class dues.
Because of the capacity of the Toyon
lobby, where the ball will be held,
only a limited number of bids could
be reserved by seniors.
Price of bids for the dance, which
will be held on Friday night, June
14, is $7.50. This will also cover the
cost of the breakfast which will be
served in the early morning hours.
Hed grained leather cigarette cases,
embossed with the Stanford seal,
will be presented to each dancer as
a souvenir program.
Plans for lighting effects to set off
the other decorations are rapidly be
ing completed by members of the
committee, and negotiations for an
off-campus orchestra are proceed
ing. Rather than have a campus or
chestra furnish music for the first
part of the evening, it is planned
that the orchestra selected play the
entire time.
