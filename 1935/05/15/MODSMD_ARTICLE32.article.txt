# A 						Bitter Trial â€” Ended?
## 
### 
Nine lo three. Thus stands the vote after
one of the most complex., dull and wordy trials
ever held in this state or any other state in
many years.
By this split verdict, a querulous jury in
timates that David Lamson is guilty of second
decree murder. At the end of days of jury
bickering and deadlock, there still remains
the possibility of another trial should Santa
Clara County see lit to go still farther and
stage a third trial.
II is not for a mere newspaper to judge the
fairness and capability of such a jury system
as lias produced the current results. Hut it
would he exceedingly interesting, neverthe
less, to inquire into the motives of the jury
in coining to their decision, how much I hex*
were influenced by relevant testimony, and
how much by mere impassioned oratory.
