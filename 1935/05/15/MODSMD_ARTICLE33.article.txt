# Newspapers, Radio and Fresh News
## 
### 
Hadio listeners will find their news fresher,
more frequent ;in<l more explicit as the re
sult of several recent agreements between
news agencies and radio stations. Hv these
agreements the agencies, recently very loath
to release news for radio until it was rather
stale, permit broadcasting of their news by
radio stations affiliated with member papers.
Not only does this move ailed the ordinary
listener's impression of news, but it also
marks another significant advance in the
march of radio to supremacy over the news
paper in point of immediate or "spot" news.
Several years ago, after the press had been
thoroughly "scooped" on important news
events by radio stations whose sources of news
were the same as their own, the Press-Radio
bureau was formed, with the avowed pur
pose of retarding news until alter it had been
printed. Competitive, independent radio-news
organizations were the result.
Today radio holds a tremendous advantage
over the newspaper. I! may get its "spot"
news from A.P., I'.P. or I.N'.S. and broadcast
il immediately, long before the newspaper has
a chance for an edition. The control usually
exercised by the newspaper supplying the
news is even abridged in the case of one
service which sells it direct.
There will be numerous complaints by pub
lishers when they find their street sales wan
ing: hut either this arrangement must survive,
or independent radio-news services will com
pete in news gathering with the press associa
tions themselves.
All Ihis will have its eff'eel. The probability
is that newspapers, with their loss of priority
in immediate news, will change their charac
ter. The newspaper will become an agency
for giving complete details of news events,
features, pictures, and interpretation, none
of which are possible now on the radio. 'And
though the publisher will be a die-hard with
reference to radio competition, he need only
consider gradual and sensible change to adapt
his paper to a changing situation.
