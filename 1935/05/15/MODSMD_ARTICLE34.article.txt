# Smoldering Mediterranean
## 
### 
To a campus engrossed in sun-worshipping,
love, and studies, news of Italy's proposed
mobilization of 950,00(1 men hv Friday is
rather upsetting, although emanating from
such a far-off place.
Home, dreaming of the rhythmic tramp of
the marching legions of the Caesars, seems
to point toward Ethiopia in the present Fast
African dispute. The consequences of such
a possible armed conflict are too numerous
and too uncertain for the Farm to consider
casually.
Although Stanford seemed certain in the
nation-wide peace poll that the I'niled States
could be kept out of the next war, the Hough
now looks uneasily toward the smoldering
situation around the Mediterranean.
