# WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE NEW DEAL?
## 
### CROMPTON BANCS, Jr 
RELIEF: RESULTS
Out «f the seven million here in New York, over a
million and a quarter (19 per cent) are on relief
of some kind. Two-thirds of those on relief live
on the dole—locally known as home relief. Irately
the whole city relief organization has been given
the once over in a search for graft and inefficiency
by—of all people—the Board of Aldermen. Out
side of a few peculiar things found for the jobless
white-collar worker to do. and a terribly top
heavy organization, nothing bad has turned up—
yet.
Of course there is potty graft, especially in getting
on the relief rolls, and that is why the army of inves
tigators (themselves jobless for the most, part) is used
to ferret out these cases. One investigator to every 50
families on relief may sound like a lot, but so far they
have proven necessary.
Naturally there is plenty of red tape; there are
all sorts of blanks to fill out, visits by the investigator
to be made to each family at least once a week, fol
lowed by a report on what was found, etc. At least the
FERA has found out many things it never knew before,
and many of those on home relief are better off than
they have ever been. Medical attention when needed
is paid for by the FERA, and probably ihe general
level of health of those on relief is better than it
ever was.
Both Republicans and Democrats say Mr. Hopkins
is responsible tor the high cost of relief by imposing
a heavy burden of red tape and by winking at graft in
those states favorable to F.R.
Nobody sees why the state should pledge itself to
raise over 30 million dollars for relief for the next two
years when the new work relief program, financed
almost wholly by the United States, is supposed to
supplant FERA this fall. The governor says he doesn't
know why, either, but that Mr. Hopkins said so, and
since Mr. Hopkins is the relief God, it must be done.
Apparently the New Deal has found a powerful,
though crooked campaign club.
SO WHAT?
Relief is here to stay. We have seen how it has
worked so far. We have seen what politics are involved
in it and a few of the personalities. The United States
has a duty to see that no one goes hungry or naked. It
has chosen the expensive way—work relief—to carry
out that duty in the future. But no matter what you
call it, the dole and some of its effects are here to stay.
Anybody in the relief business will tell you that
the growing tendency of most of the jobless is to
sit tight and take what they get, all the while
losing interest in finding work. The United States
is giving them food, light, and shelter, and the idea
that this is the way things should be is getting
stronger and stronger. How long will this last?
As long the "haves" have something to pay
taxes with, and as long as they have something
to Iniy United States bonds with.
Tomorrow—Co-ordinating the Co-ordinators.

RELIEF: RESULTS
Out «f the seven million here in New York, over a
million and a quarter (19 per cent) are on relief
of some kind. Two-thirds of those on relief live
on the dole—locally known as home relief. Irately
the whole city relief organization has been given
the once over in a search for graft and inefficiency
by—of all people—the Board of Aldermen. Out
side of a few peculiar things found for the jobless
white-collar worker to do. and a terribly top
heavy organization, nothing bad has turned up—
yet.
Of course there is potty graft, especially in getting
on the relief rolls, and that is why the army of inves
tigators (themselves jobless for the most, part) is used
to ferret out these cases. One investigator to every 50
families on relief may sound like a lot, but so far they
have proven necessary.
Naturally there is plenty of red tape; there are
all sorts of blanks to fill out, visits by the investigator
to be made to each family at least once a week, fol
lowed by a report on what was found, etc. At least the
FERA has found out many things it never knew before,
and many of those on home relief are better off than
they have ever been. Medical attention when needed
is paid for by the FERA, and probably ihe general
level of health of those on relief is better than it
ever was.
Both Republicans and Democrats say Mr. Hopkins
is responsible tor the high cost of relief by imposing
a heavy burden of red tape and by winking at graft in
those states favorable to F.R.
Nobody sees why the state should pledge itself to
raise over 30 million dollars for relief for the next two
years when the new work relief program, financed
almost wholly by the United States, is supposed to
supplant FERA this fall. The governor says he doesn't
know why, either, but that Mr. Hopkins said so, and
since Mr. Hopkins is the relief God, it must be done.
Apparently the New Deal has found a powerful,
though crooked campaign club.
SO WHAT?
Relief is here to stay. We have seen how it has
worked so far. We have seen what politics are involved
in it and a few of the personalities. The United States
has a duty to see that no one goes hungry or naked. It
has chosen the expensive way—work relief—to carry
out that duty in the future. But no matter what you
call it, the dole and some of its effects are here to stay.
Anybody in the relief business will tell you that
the growing tendency of most of the jobless is to
sit tight and take what they get, all the while
losing interest in finding work. The United States
is giving them food, light, and shelter, and the idea
that this is the way things should be is getting
stronger and stronger. How long will this last?
