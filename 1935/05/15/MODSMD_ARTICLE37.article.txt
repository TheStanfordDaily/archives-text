# CAMPUS TO CAMPUS

### 
Endings of eras are always being heralded, though
how such a process takes place is quite as unfathom
able as are most happenings cursed by metaphorical
descriptions. But if indeed it is possible to herald the
end of an era, the time Is ripe for trumpets to sound
from campus to campus. The era of notorious student
indifference to political legislation and social influences
outside the narrow realms of college boundaries seems
to be terminating.
Opening toots of the heralding were heard in the
cast when Vassar, Skidmore, and a dozen other col
leges rejoiced at the victory in the fight against the
Nunan-Devant student-oath bill in New York. When
the New York legislature proposed passing a bill
which would require all students in colleges supported
wholly or in part by public funds to take an oath of
allegiance to the state and federal constitution, college
at lenders were shocked out of their indifference coma.
Down from Vassar into the Albany capital
poured SO women hearing a petition representing
50.000 New York state students to lobby against the
hill, which, they declared, "was directed at Ileds
and Radicals, hut ;dso withheld the right of criti
cism from the conservative elements and could
have led to such a regime as Germany has under
Hitler." The Senate passed (lie hill, hut the As
sembly Education Committee killed it.
New York students objected to slate politicians
attempting to put checks on them as if they were ene
mies of the government, and by asserting themselves
prevented it. In the era of indifference they would
have merely talked about it among themselves.
That effective and concerted action in New York
naturally astonished many a citizen and politician,
who had never heard of a student group being any
thing more than a student group. One newspaper com
menting on the amazement of a suave senator, said:
"The senator doesn't know the half of what
college students are thinking these days, nor did
any of the Albany legislators seems to understand
that whatever happens to the belief iu fair play
and decency as men become senators, these con
cepts are very- important in the ideas of young
people."
That news commentator had his statement verified
shortly after when a college in another section of the
country took another surprising step. The students in
this institution objected to the brand of propaganda
which was displayed to them by a prominent chain
newspaper-owned news-reel. Instead of just grum
bling, they boycotted the theater where the propa
ganda was shown until the manager was forced to
discontinue the reels.
Of course it is not desirable for student bodies to
use their mere mass to exert influence after the man
ner of stubborn labor unions and obdurate church
groups. But the time for taking an active interest and
perhaps participation in outside affairs has oom«» for
the college student. Heralding the ending era must
bting more than mere lusty blufcU.

that whatever happens to the belief iu fair play
and decency as men become senators, these con
cepts are very- important in the ideas of young
people."
That news commentator had his statement verified
shortly after when a college in another section of the
country took another surprising step. The students in
this institution objected to the brand of propaganda
which was displayed to them by a prominent chain
newspaper-owned news-reel. Instead of just grum
bling, they boycotted the theater where the propa
ganda was shown until the manager was forced to
discontinue the reels.
Of course it is not desirable for student bodies to
use their mere mass to exert influence after the man
ner of stubborn labor unions and obdurate church
groups. But the time for taking an active interest and
perhaps participation in outside affairs has oom«» for
the college student. Heralding the ending era must
bting more than mere lusty blufcU.
Endings of eras are always being heralded, though
how such a process takes place is quite as unfathom
able as are most happenings cursed by metaphorical
descriptions. But if indeed it is possible to herald the
end of an era, the time Is ripe for trumpets to sound
from campus to campus. The era of notorious student
indifference to political legislation and social influences
outside the narrow realms of college boundaries seems
to be terminating.
Opening toots of the heralding were heard in the
cast when Vassar, Skidmore, and a dozen other col
leges rejoiced at the victory in the fight against the
Nunan-Devant student-oath bill in New York. When
the New York legislature proposed passing a bill
which would require all students in colleges supported
wholly or in part by public funds to take an oath of
allegiance to the state and federal constitution, college
at lenders were shocked out of their indifference coma.
Down from Vassar into the Albany capital
poured SO women hearing a petition representing
50.000 New York state students to lobby against the
hill, which, they declared, "was directed at Ileds
and Radicals, hut ;dso withheld the right of criti
cism from the conservative elements and could
have led to such a regime as Germany has under
Hitler." The Senate passed (lie hill, hut the As
sembly Education Committee killed it.
New York students objected to slate politicians
attempting to put checks on them as if they were ene
mies of the government, and by asserting themselves
prevented it. In the era of indifference they would
have merely talked about it among themselves.
That effective and concerted action in New York
naturally astonished many a citizen and politician,
who had never heard of a student group being any
thing more than a student group. One newspaper com
menting on the amazement of a suave senator, said:
"The senator doesn't know the half of what
college students are thinking these days, nor did
any of the Albany legislators seems to understand
that whatever happens to the belief iu fair play
and decency as men become senators, these con
cepts are very- important in the ideas of young
people."
