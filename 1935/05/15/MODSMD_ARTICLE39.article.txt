The Editor, Sir:
It seems, for once, Dave Mellin
koff, usually safely rhetorical, has !
stuck his beagle out in the fine ere- j
ative fad of knitting among Stanford
women. Now that (to again steal ;
Chappie's edit starter) knitting is
no worse than fiddling with ciga
rettes or yawning. And what's bet
ter, it produces something of utility 1
rather than consuming pennies or
wearing on the patience.
Now it is perfectly obvious as
Stanford is neither consistently in
tellectual nor civilized any more ,
than is any other country club "uni- '

I versity"' where students have king
! queen moneyed elections, fraterni-
I tics, bonfires, rally committees, and
â€ž other medieval activities which bear
titles of nr\jor interest, so when (he
women break out with such a pas
i time fad as knitting" it is really a
! siep toward productive refinement
. and is much more commendable and
j civilized (because it is creative and
I useful) than is the usual bridge
1 game or cocktail party.
Dave has made one good point,
; however, in suggesting that women
J be more polite than to knit in front
| <tf public speakers. But as far as ro
mance being impaled on knitting is
concerned, I might say that I would
; much rather have a nervous lady ask
for her knitting than for my cig-
I arettes. In fact, I'd much rather
marry a sock-knitter (if I were a
marryin' man) than a gambling
j bridge-player or an athletic and de
structive hedge-jumper.
