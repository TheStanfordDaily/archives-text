CANDIDATES in search of
AN ISSUE
To the accompaniment of sporadic
knifing and shop talk, the Spring
I Political Festival makes its debut on
the Stanford campus. As in the past,
' candidates will attempt to draw their

j Union Board of Governors voted to
i turn the "Union Dollar" over to the
pew theater, with the understanding
! that students were at some later
I date to get some sort of a cut on
! Union "profits."
j 3. And the climax of the spree of
1 generosity (with the students'
| money) came last Friday. In a spe-
I cial meeting called at the behest of
| the comptroller, a series of rather
j expensive resolutions were rail
i roaded through the Stanford Ex
! Committee, to-wit: $10,000 is taken
! out of the A.S.S.U. surplus and
I turned over to the New Theater;
j specific cognizance is taken of the
I "fact" that between the students and
