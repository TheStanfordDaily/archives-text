CANDIDATES in search of
AN ISSUE
To the accompaniment of sporadic
knifing and shop talk, the Spring
I Political Festival makes its debut on
the Stanford campus. As in the past,
' candidates will attempt to draw their
] largest blocs of votes by appealing to
| Row-Hall sectionalism. And, as in
the past, if that sort of vote garner
ing triumphs, an indifferent campus
j will get a group of indifferent stu
dent body officials.
True it is that student govern
! ment deals in the main with petty
! issues; and thus it is natural that
! campus politicians should confine
| themselves to petty issues, if they
i are so bold as to stand for anything
i at all. But there is at least one big
j issue that Stanford student govern-
I ment has to deal with; and that is an
1 issue that affects the pocketbooks of
j every man and woman on the cam
pus: the New Stanford Theater.
1. When the New Theater craze
hit the campus about a year ago, the
student body voted to assess itself a
dollar per student per quarter to
HELP build a suitable auditorium.
2. Some time later, without con
sulting the general student body, the
j Union Board of Governors voted to
i turn the "Union Dollar" over to the
pew theater, with the understanding
! that students were at some later
I date to get some sort of a cut on
! Union "profits."
j 3. And the climax of the spree of
1 generosity (with the students'
| money) came last Friday. In a spe-
I cial meeting called at the behest of
| the comptroller, a series of rather
j expensive resolutions were rail
i roaded through the Stanford Ex
! Committee, to-wit: $10,000 is taken
! out of the A.S.S.U. surplus and
I turned over to the New Theater;
j specific cognizance is taken of the
I "fact" that between the students and
I the Union (which means the stu-
J dents) a sum not to exceed $'125,000 j
j is to be turned over to' the theater; j
I and lastly and most ghastly, the
j money must be borrowed from the I
j Board of Trustees at an interest rate
j of 5 per cent—(which in these days j
j is something of an excessive rate of
I interest).
Now, there is one important thing ;
j to be noted: as far as we know the :
j students never obligated themselves
i to fork over $325,000 to the new the
| ater. True, they foolishly placed no
i expiration date on their self-assess
! ment of $1 per quarter for the new
J theater. But at the time that money |
| was voted there was some sort of a ;
I general feeling that large sums were i
j tc be raised for the theater from San j
I Francisco benefits and from private |
i donations. As it now stands, the I
! students, through the action of their I
j Ex Committee and Union Board of '
i Governors, are to pay the lion's j
j share in a half-million dollar enter- 1
I prise. That the students never in- j
I tended to do.
Just how much the students really
j want to pay as their contribution to
the New Theater should be decided j
j in the spring elections. The students ;
' should make clearly known how i
I long they want to continue paying |
: the theater dollar, before it, too, be- j
comes engrafted onto the community !
j fees in perpetuity along with the
i Union and Pavilion dollars.
i,. : I
That is an issue that candidates |
j should meet. The electorate will be ,
I interested.
