# Templeton Approves Proposed Rebuilding Of Angell Field Oval
## B.A.C. May Discuss Track Repairs at Budget Meeting Sunday 
### Gordon Frost 
It's rapidly becoming gossip
around Stanford that Angell Field it
no angel. In fact, more than one
trackster has described the historic
oval as the "very devil" and the lat
ter name becomes especially fitting
during a wet season such as the one
just passed.
Sunday night the Board of Ath
letic Control members will put their
heads together and make appropria
tions for the 19155-36 athletic sea
son, and once again tho persistent
suggestion comes forth that Angell
Field be made more fitting of its
pleasant sounding name.
Templeton Agrees
Head Track Coach Dink Temple
ton nodded his agreement last night.
"The first step in the rebuilding of
(he Stanford track team is the re
building of the track itself," was the
way Dink expressed it. Templeton
was hasty to add that the track re
pairs could not be temporary. "We're
at the bottom right now, and now is
the best time to start to build, not
just makeshift, but an entirely new
track unit."
Templeton acknowledges the fact
that rebuilding the entire unit,
which would include cutting down
the track a foot or two, building the
field up to approximately the same
level, and rearranging the field
events is too great a job to expect to
accomplish in the summer months
with the existing funds.
Wants Completion Soon
But Dink hopes that the board will
see fit to start the work, which could
be spread out over a year's time and
at least have a usable track for next
year's cinder season.
Templeton reasons that a new
track unit would be a spark to start
new fires in Stanford track interest
from the almost dead coals of this
season. "There are a lot of good
trackmen in Stanford who wouldn't
come out this year because they did
n't like the idea of spending their
time on facilities that were not very
inviting," says the Stanford track
mentor.
To Bo Attraction
With a good layout Dink believes
that there are "a lot of fellows who'll
come out and hang around from 3
o'clock in the afternoon till 6 just
running, watching other fellows run,
and talking track."
And a summary of past arguments
for tho new arrangement bring out
a score of other reasons that have
been thrown toward the B.A.C. Stan
ford must have a track that will
drain in wet weather, one that is not
as hard on muscles as Angell Field
which, when packed down in dry
weather, is said to be like "iron
plate."
Bill Ellington, assistant track
coach, exercised his views on the
matter back in January when he ad
vocated track repairs. And now with
Stanford's track coaching force and
Stanford's track team and Stan
lord's track enthusiasts pulling the
B.A.C. goes to a meeting at the end
of the week to look at the problem
in dollars and cents.
