## B.A.Câ€”ANGELL FIELD MUST HAVE REPAIRS 
### 
This column has stayed clear so
| far of reform movements, but it
j means to jump into the middle of
one right now.
The Board of Athletic Control will
hold one of its last meetings of the
year next Sunday night. It will, or
can, pass on the expenditures for
' the coming months. Angell Field is
i in distressing condition, and, if les
! sons learned this season are to mean
anything, the oval must be repaired
i before the start of another season.
A month or so ago the B.A.CYs
brief "We haven't got the money
to repair Angell Field" satisfied.
But the disp-Uch with which east
ern trips were authorized for
three athletic teams indicates that
there are the necessary funds, and
Angell Field should get its share.
