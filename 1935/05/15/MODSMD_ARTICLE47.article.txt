# WHY HANDICAP THE STANFORD TEAM?
## 
### 
Those who have watched the beat
j ings of the Stanford track team dur
ing the past few weeks have been
I appalled by one comparison: every
one of the opposing track squads
have shown distinct and often deci
sive advantages in condition over the
Stanford squad. Usually the wins by
the Trojan and California runners
have hurt more because the Stan
| ford men haven't had the training to
1 do their best.
Angell Field has been the prin-
I cipal CMise for the lack of condi
tion. On a cinder track, such as
those California and the Trojans
train on, only a few hours of dry
skies are needed to have the oval
1 in condition for running. It's a
matter of days for the dirt Angell
Field, and plenty of valuable time
was lost this winter aiul spring
waiting for the puddles to dry.
Once soaked, the Angell Field oval
is a shambles. There is absolutely
no provision for draining, except
the natural slope of the curves.
When the rains are heavy an attend
ant digs a ditch under the board on
the inside of the curves, and in a
i few hours the ditch widens into a
rut, which means a soft spot when
filled in. There are no cinders on
the surface. A runner can get into
! as good condition on a Japanese rice
field as he can on the Angell Field
oval after a spring shower.
