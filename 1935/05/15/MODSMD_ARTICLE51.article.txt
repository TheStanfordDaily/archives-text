# BLACKMAN, SMITH REJOIN CARDINALS FOR COMING MEET
## U.S.C., Bears, Bruins Meet Here on Saturday 
### Warren Breed 
Captain A1 Blackman, injured a
| week ago, got his okeh papers from
j B.A.C. medics yesterday and cele
brated his return to the cinders with
I an encouraging quarter-mile.
I He took things easy and stopped
1 Coach Templeton's watch at 50.2
seconds, not good for a runner like
Al, but not bad considering the leg
and the lay-off. John McCarthy and
Jim Cassin of S.C. and Jim LuValle
of U.C.L.A. will be running Satur
day in the Intercollegiates, and
Blackman may hit it just right and
finish with them.
The other Cardinal question mark,
High Jumper Humbert Smith, again
came out in his street clothes yes
terday, and chances are that he will
not risk any jumping until meet time
Saturday.
Weights Important
Sammy Klopstock will go into his
fifth consecutive week of big league
hurdling Saturday. Tom Moore and
Johnny Wood of Cal and Phil Cope
and his low-hurdling team-mates
from Troy will again be set on mak
ing it tough for Sammy. The highs,
with good conditions, will settle sev
eral arguments among officials and
the boys themselves.
The Stanford attempt to sneak into
second place behind the invincible
Trojans again rests on amassing
about 20 points in the shot, discus,
and javelin. In the spear event Dud
Sales is ready to grab a second place
behind Johnny Mottram. Dud got
one toss of 209 feet at Fresno, and is
the man to keep improving and beat
Fink and Fitzgerald of the Bears.
BXO Best Race
Chuck Nimmo will take another
crack at S.C.'s Bush, Cartwright, and
Johnson, Murphy of U.C.L.A., and
Brace of Cal. Chuck has had two
weeks in which to improve his time
of 1.55, and showed some unusual
speed in his lap in the mile relay at
Fresno. The 880 will be one of the
best races of the day.
Another race with plenty of com
petition will be the two-mile. Bob
Fowler, the Bear stridor, is favored,
but he will have to beat Lantz and
Yates of S.C., his team-mate, Voor
hees, and Stanford's Warren Dixon,
who is being groomed for the eight
lap race.
Records Threatened
In every event Saturday there are
several fellows who have been flirt
ing with Coast records, and several
are in danger of toppling. Both
sprints, with George Anderson of
Cal trying for a world's record, both
hurdles, the 440, two-mile, pole
vault, broad jump, discus, and jave
lin are the events where records
hang uneasily on their foundations.
