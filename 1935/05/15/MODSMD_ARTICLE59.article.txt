# Card Poloists Meet Webfoot Squad Friday
## 
### 
Oregon State's Webfoot poloists
arrive on the campus tonight to meet
the Indians in the last game of the
intercollegiate season. The contest
will be played Friday afternoon at 3
o'clock on the highway turf.
Although Stanford holds two wins
over the Staters, it doesn't hold that
the game will be a pushover for the
Cards. The two previous encounters
were played indoors with three men
instead of the usual four.
Five Men Coming
Oregon is bringing down five men:
Ray deLancy, Hugh O'Neil, A1 Se
wall, Grant Perry, and Gordon
Donely. There is a possibility that
Hal Pangle, star football player, may
come down as a sixth man. Pangle is
as outstanding on the polo field as on
the gridiron.
Lieut. Haydon Y. Grubbs will start
a revamped line-up. Carl Beal is
slated to open in the No. 1 position.
Captain Bill Rogers will fill his reg
ular No. 2 job. Jim Henderson will
move into the No. 3 spot vacated by
Beal, while Bob Fullerton will hold
down his regular No. 4 berth. Bill
Enemark, deposed No. 1 man, will
see action before the contest is over,
as will Dwyer, McKeon, and Coffin.
Squad To Divide
Although this Oregon State game
marks the end of the regular sched
ule, Lieut. Grubbs plans to split up
his "A" squad into four teams cap
tained by Rogers, Fullerton, Beal,
and Henderson or Enemark.
They will play two four-chukker
games and the two winners will meet

in a six-chukker affair to decide the
championship quartet. These con
tests should produce some excellent
polo since the teams will be very
evenly matched.
