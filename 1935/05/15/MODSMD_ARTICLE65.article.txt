# TRAVELS Of A STANFORD ROUGH
## 
### CRANT LEIBERT 
Mazatlan,
After nightfall, Mazatlan loses all
manifestations of its claim to com
mercial, economic, and agricultural
superiority of the Western Mexican
Coast and is magically transformed
into the premier potential marriage
mart of the Continent. Along the
Avenida de Olas Altas, High Wave
Avenue, which forms the seawall
for the main thoroughfare, strolls
every nubile maiden in the city.
Clad in their party dresses, red, blue,
and yellow the predominating col
ors, they swing by in twos, threes,
fours, and fives; never alone.
The young Johnny Hotbloods
perch themselves on the seawall, af
fecting a critical attitude in the man
ner of a iftan who is about to pur
chase two Belgian Percherons for
the spring plowing. The seawall is
about 250 yards long, but the belles
rarely cover that distance more than
once, for as soon as they spot a pair
of likely looking Johnnies, they
slow down and pass in front of them
a couple of times.
The Johnnies, if they be any sort
of men at all, arise, trail the senori
tas for a few yards, then begin a
polite conversation. The entire pro
cedure is entirely a matter ot form,
as far as I can make out. It would
be much simpler for the girls to
pretend each year was a leap year,

approach the boys directly, and
suggest they go in and dance. How
ever, bright ideas are made by men
like me, but the Mexicans still stick
to their custom. Getting back to
facts, once the gallant Johnny
breaks the ice, he is usually stuck
for the evening. There are four fe
males for every male in Mazatlan,
so the girls have developed a pecu
liar ability of cohering extremely
close to their squires of the evening.
From my vantage point in the
shadows I happen to observe how
neatly some of the more venture
some Johnnies perpetrate a trans
gression of the "Thou shalt go only
in odd numbers" commandment.
After a few rounds of dancing,
Johnny leaves his partner talking to
a group of friends while he goes out
and inconspicuously whispers in the
ear of a cab driver, who imme
diately drives off toward the dark
ened end of the avenue. Johnny
then strolls off in the same direction,
I to all appearances an unsocial youth,
seeking solitude for philosophical
meditation perhaps.
A short while later his partner ap
pears in front of the hotel and seems
to be looking for someone. She
crosses to one group and asks: "Oh,
have you seen Maria and Teresa?"
"No, we haven't." "Perhaps they

After nightfall, Mazatlan loses all
manifestations of its claim to com
mercial, economic, and agricultural
superiority of the Western Mexican
Coast and is magically transformed
into the premier potential marriage
mart of the Continent. Along the
Avenida de Olas Altas, High Wave
Avenue, which forms the seawall
for the main thoroughfare, strolls
every nubile maiden in the city.
Clad in their party dresses, red, blue,
and yellow the predominating col
ors, they swing by in twos, threes,
fours, and fives; never alone.
The young Johnny Hotbloods
perch themselves on the seawall, af
fecting a critical attitude in the man
ner of a iftan who is about to pur
chase two Belgian Percherons for
the spring plowing. The seawall is
about 250 yards long, but the belles
rarely cover that distance more than
once, for as soon as they spot a pair
of likely looking Johnnies, they
slow down and pass in front of them
a couple of times.
The Johnnies, if they be any sort
of men at all, arise, trail the senori
tas for a few yards, then begin a
polite conversation. The entire pro
cedure is entirely a matter ot form,
as far as I can make out. It would
be much simpler for the girls to
pretend each year was a leap year,

approach the boys directly, and
suggest they go in and dance. How
ever, bright ideas are made by men
like me, but the Mexicans still stick
to their custom. Getting back to
facts, once the gallant Johnny
breaks the ice, he is usually stuck
for the evening. There are four fe
males for every male in Mazatlan,
so the girls have developed a pecu
liar ability of cohering extremely
close to their squires of the evening.
From my vantage point in the
shadows I happen to observe how
neatly some of the more venture
some Johnnies perpetrate a trans
gression of the "Thou shalt go only
in odd numbers" commandment.
After a few rounds of dancing,
Johnny leaves his partner talking to
a group of friends while he goes out
and inconspicuously whispers in the
ear of a cab driver, who imme
diately drives off toward the dark
ened end of the avenue. Johnny
then strolls off in the same direction,
I to all appearances an unsocial youth,
seeking solitude for philosophical
meditation perhaps.
