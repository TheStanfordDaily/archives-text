94 eases, 22 measles patients
were transferred yesterday to
the old isolation hospital be
hind the campus. All new
cases will be admitted to the
Palo Alto Hospital, and the
convalescents will be moved to
the older institution.
Dr. Thomas A. Storey, head
of the Men's Health Service,
stressed the importance of hav
ing all men and women who
are not feeling well to report to
their health services immedi
ately. It is only in this man
ner that the continual trans
mission of the disease can be
avoided as much as possible.
There is nothing to become
alarmed about, according to Dr.
Storey, as all ihe eases are
mild. The second outbreak of
the epidemic is due to the fact
that two weeks ago those con
tracting the disease carelessly
or unwittingly exposed the ones
now confined. In another two
weeks a third outbreak will
probably occur.
