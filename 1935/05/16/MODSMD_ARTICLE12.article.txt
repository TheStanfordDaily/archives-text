# Triolo, Brooke Statements For Presidential Candidacy
## TRIOLO STATEMENT 
### 
I feel that a practical platform
and experience in student govern
ment are the essential qualifications
which a candidate for the A.S.S.U.
presidency must offer.
With this fact in mind I submit the
following program which is feasible
and, with sufficient industry, can be
realized.
The stand of the candidates on the
New Theater has been introduced
into the discus.sion, and after having
carefully studied the plans that have
been made for financing this struc
ture, I heartily endorse them. It is
my plan to elaborate on this point
during the discussion group tonight.
Another student problem about
which there should be definite ac
tion is the closer integration of the
Executive Committee and its various
subsidiary committees. The new
constitution has taken a step in the
proper direction, but there is work
remaining for next year's admin
istration. â€¢
Tlie point has been made in recent
student discussion groups that the
barrier between student and faculty
must, be abolished, and I feel that
such a move would be beneficial to
and welcomed by all concerned.
I sincerely believe that these prob
lems can be solved by a clear
thinking, pragmatic administration
next year and, having taken part in
numerous student activities, I feel
sufficiently qualified to accept this
responsibility.
James Triolo
