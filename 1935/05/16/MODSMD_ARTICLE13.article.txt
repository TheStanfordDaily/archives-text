# BROOKE STATEMENT
## 
### 
Intelligent student government
does not neglect one of its most im
portant functionsâ€”that of keeping
its student body alive and informed.
This has been, I believe, the major
fault with past Stanford student ad
ministrations. We can best eliminate

this by fostering faculty-student
panels, debates, and forums which
can help formulate a concise, in
telligent student body opinion. No
Ex Committee can possibly disre
gard a view arrived at in this man
ner.
Many financially harmful meas
ures have been drafted through an
unsuspecting Ex Committee. I site
only a few:
1. Tlie Pavilion financing scheme
of about 5 years ago which left the
A.S.S.U. with debts at disastrous in
terest rates. This almost entirely de
stroyed the balance of payment be
tween B.A.C. and A.S.S.U.
2. Tlie Union dollar. This plan was
well worth while as long as the
money was used for Union improve
ments, but when turned over to
other uses it lost its significance.
3. The Theater dollar, whose fu
ture was so ably discussed by Dave
Mellinkoff yesterday.
These "butches" can be prevented
in the future if president, manager,
and student body as a whole are
thoroughly alive to the present and
future situations. Unquestionably
we can improve this.
Opportunities at Stanford arc
many for every type of student. De
bate, forums, faculty, lectures on
major departments, dramatics, The
Daily, Quad, and Chappie (business
;;nd editorial), intramural, major
and minor sports, the Ex Committee,
Men's and Women's Councils, the
Convalescent Home Drive, etc., offer
almost every type of extracurricular
activity. A good student admin
istration will create and maintain
interest in these things.
I promise sincere effort to direct
our student body along these lines.
I am convinced that the outlook for
next year is very optimistic, but one
which only a definite plan plus hard
work can make possible.
