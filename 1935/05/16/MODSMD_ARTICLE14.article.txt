# Stamp Discusses Need Of Money Stabilization
## 
### 
I Until and unless the American
monetary system is taken out of
what appears to be politics, Eng
land and the United States cannot
hope for monetary stabilization, ac
cording to Sir Josiah Stamp, distin
guished British economist, and a
director of the Bank of England, who
spoke at an all-University assembly
yesterday, his first appearance be
fore a Pacific Coast audience.
England wants stabilization, Sir
Jo.siah pointed out, perhaps even
more so than docs America. Eng
land lives by foreign trade, to which
stabilization is an essential condi
tion, but she is not willing to nego
tiate for a balanced currency with
j out guarantees of monetary parity,
| demonstrated over a period of time,
| and stabilization at the right mo
j ment and at a parity reflecting the
J underlying price levels of the two
i countries.
j Washington's silver policies and its
| economic convictions Sir Josiah re
| sards as some of the most for
j midable barriers to a unified eco
; nomic system.
What he called the "rules of the
! game" constitute his credo for a
| new international system of bar
gaining. "We must have self-denial
j and a good deal of forward-looking
in our financial dealings," he de
; clared. "with the guaranty of simul
j taneous adjustment of monetary

j values between nations. We must
i recognize the turn of the statement
that buying is a necessary comple
ment of selling, and the fact, that
payment in gold between nations is
, not feasible."
England is torn between the in
ternational traders, who regard sta
bilized currency as a means of re
viving world trade, and those advo
cating only internal stability. A
pick-tip of international trade, how
ever, is Britain's only hope for pros
! Pol ity, Sir Jo.siah believes.
The gold standard represents a
purely psychological aspect of fi
nance, almost a superstitious hold
! over, Sir Josiah maintains. It is
neither necessary at this time, nor
economically feasible. Public con
! tention on the subject has led to the
; formation of popular schools of
economic thought, English proto
types of the Townsend and Sinclair
plan*. Chief of these is the Douglas
Credit System, widely supported in
London, which Sir Josiah termed
"economic measles."
While he believes that progress is
being made in the solution of the
world's monetary problems. Sir Jo
siah contends that the final solution
will come from a tjrw generation of
"trained intellectuals produced by
the universities, who have been
taught not only that a system i.s
i wrong, but why it is wrong."
