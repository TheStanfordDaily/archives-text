### 
One hundred track men, repre

who may have high ideas of them

Hooters' tickets for the in

After the revived California Inter
eollegiates in the Stanford Stadium
Saturday, directors of cinder activity
I>• t Stanford, U.S.C., California, and
I U.C.L.A. will formulate definite
plans for the other "big" meets —
1.C.4-A. and N.C.A.A.
And it is practicely obvious
I that any of the 100 stars who do
■ not come through Saturday will
! be discarded in the shuffle for
' 1.C.4-A.-worthy material, as the
four coaches submit lists of "those
j to make the trip" to boards of ath
letic control of the respective
I schools.
Stanford has six who probably
: will go—Sammy Klopstock, Johnny
i Mottram, Captain A1 Blaekman, Phil
j Levy, Jim Reynolds, and Humbert
i Smith. But what about A1 Hershey,
{ Ray Dean, Dud Sales, and BUI
j Beatty, Warren Dixon, and Chuck
! Nimmo? Ah, it remains to be seen
what takes place on the week-end
to come.

And even in the cases of Blackmail
and Smith, two gentlemen worthy
by early season performances of a
jaunt to Boston, plans will have to
be held up, pending the appearance
of a couple of right legs in competi
tion for the first time in two weeks.
The 8.A.C., it seems, will pay no
I traveling expenses for crippled ath
letes.
Blackmail's leg still looked only
fair in practice yesterday, and

] roughly since the S.C. meet.
I Individuals from the other three
I schools will have identical questions
I solved in the stadium Saturday.

i Mauger, George Mackey, Norman
jPitzgerald, and Glenn Randell—all
; packed up and ready to go East.
But he is awaiting further evi

Mushy Pollock and Eddie Vallejo
in the broad jump, Everett Leek in
Ihe 440, Bob Heavey in the mile,
Dave Meek in the weights, George
Haskell in the pole vault, and

U.C.L.A., the report goes, plans
to send only three or four men to
Boston — probably Jimmy LuValle,

All of which would indicate there
will be much rat-racing for indi
