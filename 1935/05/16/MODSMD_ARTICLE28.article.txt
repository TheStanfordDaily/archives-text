# Harvard, and "Nudist Numbers"
## 
### 
Yesterday the Dill Pickle, University of
California women's razz edition, decided lo
abolish itself. Hut the Harvard Lampoon
came out yesterday with an edition that was
so unusual that three thousand Harvard stu
dents themselves decided lo make away with
si\ hundred copies, stored in the humor mag
azine oflices, and stormed the place.
The college humorists made no hones about
their edition. They called it the "Nudist Num
ber," and advertised such tidbits as "Love
Below the Mason-l)i\on Line," and "Desire
Under the Kims."
Whether out of a moral sense of duty
against the censored, banned, restricted, et
cetera, publication, or merely because they
thought it would be lots of fun, the three
thousand Eastern collegians had a #reat time,
furnished the news services with much hu
morous material.
They draped the copies out of the building
and set fire to them. The liremen responded,
bill refused to put out the bonfire because the
adjacent buildings were of brick and would
not catch lire anyhow. Imagine the same
situation on the campus. Were Chaparral to
come out with such a number, three thousand
students would probably shrui; their shoul
ders, perhaps buy a copy, and semKil home
for little Junior to read.
