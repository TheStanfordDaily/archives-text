# WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE NEW DEAL?
## CO-ORDINATING THE CO-ORDINATORS 
### CROMPTON BANGS, Jr 
WASHINGTON, D.C., May 14.—For the last two
years Frank Walker and Donald Richberg have taken
turns at being the New Deal's co-ordinator. Just now
Walker is holding the bag. So far nobody has suc
cessfully co-ordinated anything. But experts agree
that unless the gears of the New Deal machine are
kept from clashing it will soon break down. Let's look
at several examples of clashing New Deal policies and
then let's see what makes them clash.
Both AAA and NRA have been running nearly two
years. The former was supposed to increase farm buy
ing power, the latter industrial. So far they have
worked at cross-purposes; while the farmer gets more
he has to pay more for what he buys, and if it
weren't for the cash handout given him he would be
right back where he was two years ago. In the mean
time the powerful combination of processing taxes, the
drought, and just plain dumbness on the part of AAA
resulted in skyrocketing prices which were too stiff for
the workers. Both agencies were supposed to help;
each alone could, but both together just counteract
each other.
Again there are still more glaring examples of
New Deal gear-clashing. The whole idea of pump
priming through relief and public works cash
filtering down to industry and agriculture de
pends upon a quick revival of capital lending for
new plants, improvements, etc. President Roose
velt Ir»s said so several times. If private capital
doesn't come in soon and take the place of Uncle
Sam's, the whole New Deal may fold up like a
broken umbrella.
In spite of this F.R. has taken every opportunity tc
scare away possible capital investment by advocating
burning down the house to get rid of the bed-bugs of
crooked finance. This was first done through the SEC
until Mr. Kennedy—a sensible man—got hold of it.
Lately it has been done by way of the proposed Ray
burn Bill regulating public utilities. It may be a way
of scaring the industry to get it to do its own house
cleaning, but so far it has not had this effect, and ha.",
scared what capital there is back into its hole.
There are good reasons why New Deal policies are
constantly working at cross-purposes. Wheny any
thing is wrong with a piece of machinery, we usually
look at it, not at the idea behind it. To a large extent
that is what is wrong with the New Deal.
In Washington cabinet members, emergency or
ganization heads, even the President are con
stantly pre-occupied with what OUGHT to be, not
with how things ARE. They fail to look at their own
organizations for the trouble; instead they blame all
their woes on the most convenient bogey-man, who
have come to be almost synonymous with business men.

organizations for the trouble; instead they blame all
their woes on the most convenient bogey-man, who
have come to be almost synonymous with business men.
WASHINGTON, D.C., May 14.—For the last two
years Frank Walker and Donald Richberg have taken
turns at being the New Deal's co-ordinator. Just now
Walker is holding the bag. So far nobody has suc
cessfully co-ordinated anything. But experts agree
that unless the gears of the New Deal machine are
kept from clashing it will soon break down. Let's look
at several examples of clashing New Deal policies and
then let's see what makes them clash.
Both AAA and NRA have been running nearly two
years. The former was supposed to increase farm buy
ing power, the latter industrial. So far they have
worked at cross-purposes; while the farmer gets more
he has to pay more for what he buys, and if it
weren't for the cash handout given him he would be
right back where he was two years ago. In the mean
time the powerful combination of processing taxes, the
drought, and just plain dumbness on the part of AAA
resulted in skyrocketing prices which were too stiff for
the workers. Both agencies were supposed to help;
each alone could, but both together just counteract
each other.
Again there are still more glaring examples of
New Deal gear-clashing. The whole idea of pump
priming through relief and public works cash
filtering down to industry and agriculture de
pends upon a quick revival of capital lending for
new plants, improvements, etc. President Roose
velt Ir»s said so several times. If private capital
doesn't come in soon and take the place of Uncle
Sam's, the whole New Deal may fold up like a
broken umbrella.
In spite of this F.R. has taken every opportunity tc
scare away possible capital investment by advocating
burning down the house to get rid of the bed-bugs of
crooked finance. This was first done through the SEC
until Mr. Kennedy—a sensible man—got hold of it.
Lately it has been done by way of the proposed Ray
burn Bill regulating public utilities. It may be a way
of scaring the industry to get it to do its own house
cleaning, but so far it has not had this effect, and ha.",
scared what capital there is back into its hole.
There are good reasons why New Deal policies are
constantly working at cross-purposes. Wheny any
thing is wrong with a piece of machinery, we usually
look at it, not at the idea behind it. To a large extent
that is what is wrong with the New Deal.
In Washington cabinet members, emergency or
ganization heads, even the President are con
stantly pre-occupied with what OUGHT to be, not
with how things ARE. They fail to look at their own
organizations for the trouble; instead they blame all
their woes on the most convenient bogey-man, who
