# VIEWING THE NEWS
## WITH ARTHUR M. CATHCART 
### CEDRIC LARSON 
(Editor's Note: The Sacramento syndicalism
trhl and various "red"' scares during 1!)H5 have
raised anew the question of certain legal aspects
of freedom of press and speech under the guaran
tees of the constitution. In a three-article series,
Professor Arthur M. Cathcart of the Law School
will present his conclusions on the subject, with
illustrations drawn chiefly from California.)
In an article which appeared under "Viewing the
News" for April 2, 1935, in The Daily, Professor Ar
thur M. Carthcart showed that freedom of press and
speech were guaranteed from government infringement
only, and that the public administration was not bound
to provide facilities for personal publicity.
The question may well be raised:' "If discussion of
the form of government cannot be prevented, how is
it that aliens holding anarchistic beliefs are excluded
from entering the country?"
The point issue is that Congress possesses
the discretionary power to decide who shall or
shall not enteu the United States. If an alien is
therefore specifically barred from entering, he is
in fact prohibited from expressing his opinions ipso
facto, but this merely arises from his exclusion to
our country and is not a prohibition of freedom of
speech.
Congress wields similar power of discretion with
reference to naturalization. Should the would-be im
migrant be unable to meet or dislike the terms of
admission, he can stay outside.
"Like considerations obtain with reference to
elusion of certain printed matter from the mails,"
states Professor Cathcart. "It has often been argued
before the Supreme Court that this is a form of press
censorship and consequently unconstitutional, but the
argument has always been rejected. In exercising its
postal powers, Congress must of necessity determine
just how far its service shall extend."
Congress may judge, therefore, in specifying
what shall or shall not be placed in the mails. It
may and does exclude unlawful or immoral mat
ter from the mails. Low unremunerative rates
prevail over special classes of mail on the assump
tion that they possess public education;d value,
and the publisher must show that his publication
complies with the law to obtain the low rate and
privilege.
Necessarily some public officer must decide upon
the application, and the Supreme Court has held that
the postmaster general may be clothed with this power,
subject to judicial review. It may constitute censor
ship and the only way to get around it is not to ask
for the privilege.
"Similarly, if the government, state or national, un
dertakes to provide for education in public schools,
colleges, or universities, it must necessarily determine
what subjects shall be taught at taxpayers' expense
and therefore what subjects shall not be taught," the
law professor says.
"And here we may observe in passing that just
as the state may say what its teachers shall
teach it may Â»iiso, as a rule, determine what its
students shall study.
"It will be remembered that only a few months ago
the United States Supreme Court held thiit California
was well within her rights in prescribing military in
struction for students in the University of California.
There again those who avail themselves of a privilege
must also accept its lawful conditions," remarks the
professor.
