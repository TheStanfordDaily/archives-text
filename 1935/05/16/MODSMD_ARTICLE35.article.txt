# BULL SESSION
## APPLESAUCE IN AMADOR 
### 
Up in Amador County, where you j
j are either tough or dead, there is
| trouble in the gold mines. For' sev-
J eral months the miners have been
| striking for higher wages and better
| working conditions. And naturally,
they have been picketing the mines.
But so peaceful has their picketing
been that even the San Francisco
press has not raised "the flag of
bloody revolution."
The owners, having failed to bluff
the miners into surrender by a threat
to flood the mines, are now attempt- (
ing to operate the works with scab !
labor and illegal intimidation. And
masking its true purpose under a
ipatriotic title, the American Pro
tective League has been formed to
do the bludgeoning for the mine |
| owners.
When sympathetic workers in San i
i Francisco asked for state protection |
I to convey food to the striking min- 1
j ers, the request was refused. And j
! when the sympathetic workers took ;
jthe food in for the relief of their!
| fellow workers, a skirmish was pre
j cipitated with the American Pro- j
! fective League rushing in with
I baseball bats to crown the relief ex- I
j pedition. The net result was that j
j gas was turned on the strikers, and '
| several of the strikers were locked
! up. The Protective League was :
! happy.
Spurred on by their efforts, the j
! American Protective League became i
! bold. When the President of the '
| State Federation of Labor sent his !
personal representative into the j
| strike area to investigate conditions, i.
the league hustled Mr. Warren out j
of town, and told him if ho returned j
he would be "shot on sight." That is |
the way matters stand.
Now we remember .last summer, j
Mr. Merriam said that law must be i
maintained. At that lime strikers j
were said to be attacking life and ;
property. At any rate, the militia j
was called out.
And when vigilante mobs raided j
Communist offices in the city, the i
militia did not stop them.
And now, when vigilante mobs
beat up very peaceful pickets, and

, run the representative of the con- 1
servatiye state labor federation out j
lof town—the militia, and the po
lice, and the governor all stand by ,
—and do nothing.
When militia are called out to gas
; and shoot down workingmen (as J
they were in San Francisco last j
isummer), and are not called out to !
even tickle vigilantes with the tip
! of a bayonet when the workers are
endangered, it is not to wonder that |
some should. say that the state is ,
prejudiced in favor of the owning
classes. If that is to be disproved,
the forces of law and order must act
quickly and differently than they
have in the past.
If it is really lawlessness that Gov
ernor Merriam is interested in sup- >

pressing, we suggest that he do more
than view with contented alarm the
news from Amador County.
