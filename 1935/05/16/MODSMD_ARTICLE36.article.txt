SQUARING TIIE CIRCLE
Most people think of Communists
as Jong-haired, wild-eyed fanatics.
• Those who went to the Community
Playhou.se Saturday evening had
; their ideas revised.
For""Squaring the Circle" is a
merry Soviet comedy, in which the
j new-day Russians have a riotous
time poking none-too-gentle iun at
themselves.
'The play revolves around two
[ Comrades, rooming in the same
room, «ach believing the other a
j confirmed bachelor. Each, unbe
, knownijt to the other, gets married
I on the same day, and each brings
I his bride to their common quarters.
Difficulties arise when neither
| pair proves compatible. The final
i solution is a trade of spouses, but
j before that end is reached, there i.s
| much concern over "party ethics"
! and hew to redeem the soul, or its
| equivalent in Russian ideology, of
| the "non-partisan comrade," who is
, one of the wives.
Dick Dawson as Vasya, one of the
! husbands, was a little wooden in his
I role at first, but warmed up later
' and turned in a really good per
! formance.
Shelley Smith as Vasya's wife,
Ludmilla, shows the results of her
! experience with Harold Helvenston
<in stock in San Francisco. She has
| improved greatly and has turned out
! to be a very creditable actress, even
i judging from the professional stand
: point.
George Wood, as the other hus
! band, was also a little in
I spots, but turned in what was on
j the whole a very interesting por-
I trayal. Jean Xlbertson, as the sec
j ond wife, was also good.
j Robert Poole did a bluff and hearty
i Russian "poet of the masses" to per
[ fection
Director James Benet kept the
pace moving .swiftly, at times, per
! haps, a bit too swiftly for the actors,
i but he is to be congratulated on his
i very capable production.
