A TWIN FOR TIIE
OLD CAL OVAL

The prime need for repairs to An
gell Field is to give the Stanford
track team a place to train through
out the year, rain or shine, as Cali
fornia, Southern California, and
other Coast schools can.
But many believe that the oval
should be entirely torn up and re
built if any improvements are to
be made at all. As one track man
expressed it: "I'd rather have
shin-splints for three more years
and wait till Stanford could have
a really good track, th.-in have a
few repairs made this year, and
then have Angell Field rot again
for 10 or 15 years."
It is true that Stanford needs a
good track. The stadium never has
been more than make-shift; if there
is a breeze anywhere on the western
slope, it will be blowing down the
straightaway in the stadium. In
rainy weather the clay surface of the
stadium track is slippery and gum
my. For years the discus throwers
have been some of the mainstays of
the Stanford track team, but when
the meets are held on Angell Field,
as they usually are, only the man
agers and the participants are in a
position to witness this event.
What Dink Templeton pointed
out yesterday, and what most peo
ple don't see is that waiting sev
eral years for these needed im
provements will have a decidedly
harmful long-run effect on Stan
ford track as a whole. A similar
experience by a rival university
just showed that effect concretely.
It was only a few years ago that
track at California was hopelessly
"in the dumps." The Cal track off
Dwight Way, backed by the Cam
panile, was about as good as Angell
Field, except that it was better
kept up. The bleachers were dilapi
dated, the track had a dirt surface
which was hopeless after a rain, and
the turns were too sharp for the best
running. The oval was the object of
general scorn, and interest in Cali
fornia track suffered as a result.
Winning track teams were an im
possibility, as Walter Christie,
coach at that time, will admit.
When California track started
an upswing that was climaxed in
the Big Meet this year the orig
inal impetus was given by the
new Edwards Field stadium.
The fear that Stanford may get
into the same fix because of an in
ferior track is something more than
a conjecture. The effects are al
ready obvious. Stanford is host this
Saturday to three of the four strong
est track teams in the country. But
the city papers are laying aside the
possibility that records might fall,
as they should. As one big black
head on a yesterday's green sheet
gently expressed it, "STANFORD'S
OVAL DOESN'T LURE OL' MAN
RECORD." To say that such com
ment doesn't hurt Stanford track in
terest is to ignore what has already
been proven.
A strong example of this feel
ing on the part of those outside
was given last Saturday, when
Stanford phyed host at the annual
meet of the Northern California
high schools. Some of the fans
that didn't make the Fresno trip
naturally approached the stand
outs among the preps as to fu
ture alma maters. They found
th<Mt they had to buck against
more than the rushing activities of
the other schools. The high school
athletes look down on the Stan
ford oval with the same scorn that
was given the old Cal track. They
figure it foolish to spend four
years running on a hard dirt track
when they can run on a fast cin
der one.
Sunday night when the B.A.C.
meets to appropriate funds for the
coming year it should remember
Angell Field—the effect that di
lapidated track is already having on
interest in Stanford track, the long
run effect that is bound to i-esult.

for 10 or 15 years."
It is true that Stanford needs a
good track. The stadium never has
been more than make-shift; if there
is a breeze anywhere on the western
slope, it will be blowing down the
straightaway in the stadium. In
rainy weather the clay surface of the
stadium track is slippery and gum
my. For years the discus throwers
have been some of the mainstays of
the Stanford track team, but when
the meets are held on Angell Field,
as they usually are, only the man
agers and the participants are in a
position to witness this event.
What Dink Templeton pointed
out yesterday, and what most peo
ple don't see is that waiting sev
eral years for these needed im
provements will have a decidedly
harmful long-run effect on Stan
ford track as a whole. A similar
experience by a rival university
just showed that effect concretely.
It was only a few years ago that
track at California was hopelessly
"in the dumps." The Cal track off
Dwight Way, backed by the Cam
panile, was about as good as Angell
Field, except that it was better
kept up. The bleachers were dilapi
dated, the track had a dirt surface
which was hopeless after a rain, and
the turns were too sharp for the best
running. The oval was the object of
general scorn, and interest in Cali
fornia track suffered as a result.
Winning track teams were an im
possibility, as Walter Christie,
coach at that time, will admit.
When California track started
an upswing that was climaxed in
the Big Meet this year the orig
inal impetus was given by the
new Edwards Field stadium.
The fear that Stanford may get
into the same fix because of an in
ferior track is something more than
a conjecture. The effects are al
ready obvious. Stanford is host this
Saturday to three of the four strong
est track teams in the country. But
the city papers are laying aside the
possibility that records might fall,
as they should. As one big black
head on a yesterday's green sheet
gently expressed it, "STANFORD'S
OVAL DOESN'T LURE OL' MAN
RECORD." To say that such com
ment doesn't hurt Stanford track in
terest is to ignore what has already
been proven.
A strong example of this feel
ing on the part of those outside
was given last Saturday, when
Stanford phyed host at the annual
meet of the Northern California
high schools. Some of the fans
that didn't make the Fresno trip
naturally approached the stand
outs among the preps as to fu
ture alma maters. They found
th<Mt they had to buck against
more than the rushing activities of
the other schools. The high school
athletes look down on the Stan
ford oval with the same scorn that
was given the old Cal track. They
figure it foolish to spend four
years running on a hard dirt track
when they can run on a fast cin
der one.
Sunday night when the B.A.C.
meets to appropriate funds for the
coming year it should remember
Angell Field—the effect that di
lapidated track is already having on
interest in Stanford track, the long
run effect that is bound to i-esult.

The prime need for repairs to An
gell Field is to give the Stanford
track team a place to train through
out the year, rain or shine, as Cali
fornia, Southern California, and
other Coast schools can.
But many believe that the oval
should be entirely torn up and re
built if any improvements are to
be made at all. As one track man
expressed it: "I'd rather have
shin-splints for three more years
and wait till Stanford could have
a really good track, th.-in have a
few repairs made this year, and
then have Angell Field rot again
for 10 or 15 years."
