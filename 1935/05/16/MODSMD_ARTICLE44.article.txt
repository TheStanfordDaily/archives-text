# INDIAN TRACKMEN EXPRESS OPINIONS OF ANGELL FIELD
## Track Hard, Drains Poorly, Say Four Runners 
### Gordon Frost 
Stanford's trackmen echoed and
I re-echoed last night the words of
i their coach, Dink Templeton, that
I ancient Angell Field had seen its
i shoe wearers, bearers of the Stanford
best days. From those same spiked
"S," came words of hope that the
B.A.C. would see fit to do something
about it at their budget meeting
j Sunday night.
Captain A1 Blackman led the pa-
I rade of athletes, men who were first
' hand authorities that the Angell
| Field of today is nothing more than
| a sad reminder of those past days of
j Stanford track supremacy, hardly a
I track upon which to train more
champion track squads.
Bhckman Quoted
"Track here at Stanford is about at
i its lowest ebb in 10 years and in or-
I der to get new interest we've got to
fix up the track itself. We don't
want just a half-way surfacing job;
j we need a whole new layout. Angell
I Field is just about the worst track
| the Stanford team has run on this
i year." Those were Blackman's
j words.
1 Right behind Al, ready to back up
his arguments, was Truck Del linger,
Blackman's understudy in the quar
! ter-mile run. Truck's spontaneous
j answer to the query, "What do you
i think of Angell Field?" was all -
i inclusive. "I think its lousy. I'd
1 rather run in the street." But Del
| linger wasn't through talking.
Muscles Pulled
"You know, about 75 per cent of
-the fellows out here today have
pulled muscles just because this
track gets so hard in dry weather
that it's terrible." And then Truck
proceeded to name the fellows, lists
of them, who've felt the shooting
pain of a pulled muscle while tread
ing Angell Field.
Sammy Klopstock agreed that the
track wasn't very good. He thought
that of all the cinder-paths he'd run
j on this season and Angell Field took
' an uncontested last place,
j "Fresno has the fastest track to
i race on; Edwards Field at Berkeley
! is the best to train on. What we need
iis one like Cal's." Sammy went on:
j "Over at Cal they can work out
j right after a rain; the track drains
I perfectly. Here we have to wait
' days before the puddles disappear."
Dean's Legs Hurt
Little Ray Dean, whose short but
j lightening-like legs carried him to
j third place in the century ahead of
i U.S.C.'s sprinter Foy Draper at
I Fresno last Saturday, knows every
j foot of the 100-yard stretch of the
j Angell Field straightaway. He's
I formed his own opinions of that
stretch.
Ray's remarks weren't extensive
but his one short sentence was
enough. "It's so darn hard it makes
your legs sore," was Sprinter Dean's
:terse reply.
