# CARDS-O.S.C. TO MEET IN POLO
## 
### 
Stanford's mallet-wieiders meet
the Oregon State polo team tomor
row in the third game between the
schools this season. The contest is
scheduled for 3 o'clock on the High
way Field.
Captain Bill Rogers, brilliant No.
2, will be playing his last intercol
legiate game for Stanford. Rogers
has smashed his team to victory on
many occasions. His work during the
last Arizona series will be long re
membered.
Jim Henderson is another who
will close out his collegiate career
in this game. Henderson will start
in the No. 3 position. During the
Arizona contests he played some at
back, but was unfamiliar with those
duties. He plays best at No. 3.
Carl Beal will start at No. 1 in
place of Bill Enemark. Beal is a
junior and will be back next season.
He has a real wallop and a good
scoring eye.
Bob Fullerton at back rounds out
the team. Fullerton displays a ter
rific wallop and next to .Rogers rates
as the best scoring threat. He is only
a sophomore.
Lieut. Haydon Grubbs believes
that although Stanford defeated the
Staters twice in the north in indoor
games, this game may be close.
