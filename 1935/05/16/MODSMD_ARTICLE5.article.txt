## 
### 
Only eight parts were filled defi- j
nitely in yesterday's skit tryouts for
"Follies Bourgeois," says Skit Di r I
rector Frank O'Neill. No more try- '
outs will be held, but final decision
on other actors will be announced ;
later.
Those chosen to appear in the Fol- j
lies are Mary Liles, new to Stanford j
dramatics; Shelley Smith, who took j
part in "Three Cornered Moon," j
"Distant Drums," readings, Gaieties, I
and other plays; Betty Reynolds, also j
new; and Annelies Morgan, whose |
most recent appearance was in "Her |
Master's Voice."
Men include Fred Clark, who i
played Private Dean in ''Yellow j
Jack"; Sterling Cotlrell, Ex Commit- |
tee member; Joseph Lawry, also of
"Yellow Jack"; and Sidney Head,
who claims much past experience.
"Tryouts were highly satisfac
tory," commented O'Neill. A large
group of cajJable actors appeared,
and "a very smooth-running, inti- !
mate revue is promised," he said.
Monday, at 4 o'clock, tryouts will !
be held for all interested in singing
or other musical novelties in the
women's old gymnasium. Stars of
last fall's Gaieties are expected to
take part in the Dramatic Council
Spring Musical.
The follies will be entirely the
work of students, says Manager Dick
Frank. Eight experienced students
have been named to supervise va
rious phases of the show, with Hart
Preston as general director.
The date has been set at May 31.
Campus ticket sale will begin .soon,
but mail orders will be taken n<sxt
week. The follies will conclude dra
matics for this year, and takes the
place of the Junior Opera.
