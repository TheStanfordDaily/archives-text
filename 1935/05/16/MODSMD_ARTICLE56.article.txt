# University Press Issues Leaflet on Silent Reading
## 
### 
For the purpose of furthering ef
fective silent reading for college and
high .school students, a leaflet en-
I titled "How To Read Rapidly and
i Well," written by C. Gilbert Wrenn,
; student personnel director, and
I Luella Cole, formerly of Ohio State
| University, has recently come off the
J Stanford University Press.
Realizing the fact that 85 to 95
per cent of a student's time is de
! voted to reading, the authors try to
; aid the students in attaining better
speed and comprehension through
, this manual. The contents are de-
I rived from cumulative research on
reading from many laboratories, and
| from the practical experience of the
authors in dealing with the reading
| problems of college students.
Six sections deal with the various
| aspects of silent reading. These are
i entitled "Phrase Reading," "Reading
for Meaning," "The Mechanics of
! Reading," "Learning to Read Rap
idly," "Making a Preliminary Sur
vey," and "Mastering a Whole
Chapter."
Some gleanings from the pages
give an idea of the material in the
leaflet. Among the causes of poor
comprehension were listed incor
rect eye-movements and excessive
vocalization, an insufficient vocabu-

I lary, inadequate background, lack of I
I anticipation of what Is to come, and j
; poor concentration.
Eye movements with reference to I
silent reading are discussed quite i
amply. Too many fixations per line, !
; regressive movements, failure to hit i
successive lines accurately, and lack I
jof eye rhythm are stated as bad i
! mechanical habits.
I
To make a preliminary survey of i
the chapter to be read is considered |
an important phase in reading. Such
| details as looking over the table of J
contents, the title of the chapter and !
main sections, and subtitles of lesser !
1 sections aid in forming a mental out- ,
| line of the chapter.
An individual check-list of read- [
, ing efficiency accompanies the man- \
; ual. Copies are available at the i
Stanford Bookstore.
