# CAMPUS OPINION
## ANGELL FIELD REPAIRS 
### 
j The Editor, Sir:
Unusual weather and the lack of
i a draining system for Angell Field
j might well be termed the downfall
| of the 1935 Stanford track team. In
j our opinion, if the B.A.C. can pro
j vide teams with the means to make
eastern trips to compete in inter-
I collegiate sports, it should recog
i nize the necessity of providing
I proper facilities for the correct
I training and conditioning of such
! teams. Although the repairing of
] Angell Field, we fully realize,
I would cost considerably more than
j the eastern trips, it seems funda
; mental that a correction of the pres
! ent condition of Angell Field is a
necessity in order to prevent a repe
tition of the prgsent track season.
Comparing the track seasons of
Stanford and California, it is inter
esting to note that whereas Stanford
I was forced to cancel two meets, Cali
| fornia went through her season
j without a cancellation. So we say
i more power to the movement to
j ward the rehabilitation of Angell
! Field, with the expectancy of a bct
i ter future record and a smaller num
ber of cancellations.
