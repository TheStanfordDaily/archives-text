# FASCISTS WANT RULE OF ITALY OVER ETHIOPIA
## Il Duce Declares Countries Must Keep Hands Off In African Affair 
### 
ROME, May 15 (jPi.â€”ltalian news
! papers openly demanded today im
position of a new "organization" on
Ethiopia, which was taken by diplo
! matic circles to mean civil or mili
tary control by Italy.
The authoritative Giornale D'ltalia,
which most often is chosen to echo
i government plans, said "Ethiopia's
j incapacity to comprehend and as
| similate the elementary values of
| civilization" made it necessary that
i "there be given Ethiopian territory
j an organization which will deprive it
of the possibility of menacing any
; more neighboring colonics, above all
Italian interests which have been
! attacked."
II Duce Bold
These blasts followed upon the
; bold declaration by Benito Musso
lini that other nations must keep
their hands off the Italo-Ethiopian
| dispute.
(Well-informed London quarters
J said Great Britain, despite II Duce's
| edict, would continue her nego
j tiations to prevent war between
Rome and Addis Ababa.)
Italy's Rights
That it is to be Italy which will
j impose this "organization" upon
i Ethiopia was recognized by the
I Giornale D'ftalia when it said: "To
| recognize the European value of
j Italy as a civilized nation and power
! for equilibrium signifies to recog
i nize also these Italian necessities in
I East Africa, her rights of defense
| and of guarantees."
It is not to be doubted, the news
i paper concluded, that "England, so
! abundantly furnished with rich
I colonial territories and precious
| mandates, will recognize the just
I basis of these Italian positions."
Italian newspapers in dispatches
from Paris and London said Mus
solini's speech yesterday had a defi
nite effect of reorienting opinions of
those two governments.
