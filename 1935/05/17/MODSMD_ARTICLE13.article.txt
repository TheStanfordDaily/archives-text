# LABOR DISPUTE BILL SECURES EASY TRIUMPH
## Upper House Sends Wagner Measure Through With 63 to 12 Vote 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 16
! Gathering such momentum that only
J twelve shouted votes of "no" were
I recorded against it, the Wagner labor
| disputes bill, designed to guarantee
| rights of workers to bargain collec
j tivcly, today swept through the Scn
i ate and went to the House.
Only eight Republicans and four
j Democrats placed themselves openly
: in opposition in the 63 to 12 ballot,
; widely considered a major victory
j for labor. Bitterly fought by many
| industrial factions, it places a ban
| against all company unions domi
! nated by employers and provides for
! bargaining through representatives
| chosen by a majority in plant elec
-1 tions.
Roosevelt to Approve
Supporters of the bill, which cre-
I ates a permanent National Labor
j Relations Board with power to order
J plant elections, said they were con
fident President Roosevelt would
! approve it.
| The four Democrats voting in op
position today were Tydings of
i Maryland. Burke of Nebraska, Byrd
!of Virginia, and Bailey of North
Carolina.
Briefly, the bill would:
Establish a permanent labor rela-
I lions board of three members, a sort
i of quasi-judicial body with power to
order by secret ballot or otherwise
| an election to determine collective
bargaining representatives. Any or
ders promulgated by it after an
: election would be reviewable by the
I courts.
Unfair Practices
; It would lay down five unfair la
bor practices, and forbid employers
i from:
I 1. Interfering with, restraining, or
coercing employees in exercise of
| their rights, guaranteed in another
j section, to organize and bargain col
j lectively through representatives of
their own choosing.
2. Dominating or interfering with
formation or administration of any
labor organization or contributing
i financial aid or other support to it.
This is the so-called company-domi
nated union ban.
3. Encouraging or discouraging
membership in any labor organiza-
I tion by discrimination in regard to
hire, or tenure of employment, or
any term or condition of employ
. ment.
! 4. Discharging or discriminating
against an employee for filing
I charges or giving testimony under
the proposed act.
5. Refusing to bargain collectively
with representatives of their em
ployees, subject to provisions of an
other section providing that bar
gaining representatives chosen by a
majority of employees in a particu
lar unit shall represent all the em
ployees of such unit exclusively in
bargaining on pay, wages, hours, and
| other conditions. A minority would
' be allowed to present "grievances."
