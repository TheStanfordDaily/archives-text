# Card Bandmaster Recalls Days with Victor Herbert
## 
### 
Victor Herbert, whose name is a
household word wherever comic op
era is performed, is a vivid memory
to Bandmaster Will 11. Bickett,
Stanford band director, who was
associated wilh the famous composer
lin Chicago for many years. The
, eleventh anniversary of the song
writer's death is this month.
I "Herbert was a most brilliant
man," reminisces the bandmaster.
"He could sit down at :i table and
simultaneously eat a meal, carry on
a conversation, and write a song for
hi.s next show which w;\s produced
without a change in manuscript."
Born in Dublin, Ireland in 1859,
Victor Herbert received his mu
sical training in Germany, and be
j came ;i skilled cello player. He was
'a member of the court orchestra in
Stuttgart, and appeared in concerts
both in Europe and America.
Soon he was writing and produc
ing his own music, and such cele
brated comic operas as "The Fortune
Teller," "Babes in Toyland," "Na
toma," and "Naughty Marietta"
came from his facile pen in rapid
succession.
Bickett recalls a peculiarity of the
composer. When engaged in con
versation, Herbert would often
pause, hum i tunc that occurred to
him and taking out pencil and
paper, exclaim: "I guess I'll jot that
melody down, it'll be popular some
day!"
Pue to the thoroughness of the
German school of music, Herbert
was u stickler for precision and fine

shading effects in his compositions.
Temperamental, witty, clever, a
shrewd business man, and versatile
, of talent, the Irbh-Anvrican com
poser stands out sharply in ihe mem
ory of Bickctt.
The Stanford bandmaster is in
variably at his best when he drills
the Stanford band in some composi
tion of Herbert. "Now men, Herbert
wanted that played a little slower
and softer in those last three meas
ures." or similar comment, he often
| points out.
