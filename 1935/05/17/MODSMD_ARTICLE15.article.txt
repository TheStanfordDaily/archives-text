WASHINGTON, May 16
â€”The Federal Communications
Commission had before it today
a recommendation for the es
tablishment of a public radio
broadcasting system to supple
ment, but not supplant, the
present private systems.
The recommendation was
made by Dr. Arthur G. Crane,
president of the University of
Wyoming, speaking on behalf
of the National Committee on
Education by Radio.
Establishment of the system
was recommended after four
years of study and investigation
made by the committee. Under
the plan programs free from
advertising would be made
available to American listeners
and also programs presenting
entertainment and information
to "promote the general wel
fare."
