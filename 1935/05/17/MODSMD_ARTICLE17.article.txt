# Edgar Payne Paintings Shown in Art Gallery
## 
### 
Twenty-three colorful oil paint
ings by Edgar Payne, marine and
landscape painter, are being ex
hibited at the Stanford Art Gallery
between 10 and 5 o'clock every day.
The pictures will be on display until
July 8.
Mr. Payne, who has studied at the
Chicago Art Institute and traveled
abroad extensively, has won many
honors for his work both in this
country and in Europe. This exhi
bition of his painting may be the
last at Stanford for some time, for
the artist has been asked to super
vise color work in a prominent mo
tion picture studio.
