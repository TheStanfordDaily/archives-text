# S.C. Rated Over Cards, Bears In Intercollegiates
## Blackman, Smith Still Hurt Indians Given Good Chance Over U.C. 
### Warren Breed 
A great track treat is the fare
for tomorrow's fifth running of the
California Intercollegiates. Teams
from Stanford, U.S.C., U.C., and
U.C.L.A. will tread the Stadium
cinders to throw light on three
questions vital to the track situation
—(1) team superiority, (2) individ
ual performances and new records,
(3) insight to the coming national
meets.
In the first department little less
than a miracle could keep S.C. from
walking away with upwards of 70
points. Interesting, however, will be
the fight between the Cards and the
Bears for second place.
Blackmail Ailing
Captain A1 Blackman did not work
out yesterday. His leg, injured a
week ago, was still sore, throttling
down Card hopes of beating the
Bears.
In the second department, thrre
are no less than nine records that
stand in jeopardy. In a!l nine,
performances already this year
have bettered the existing stand
ards.
Individual duels will see the Kiop
stock-Wood-Moore-Cope dog - fight
in the high hurdles, the McCarthy-
Cassm-LuValle 440, the Bush-Cart
wright-Brace-Nimmo 880, the Ol
sen - Crawford - Jungkcit - Dean-
Maramuto broad jump, the Sefton-
Meadows - Massey - Valentine pole
vault, the Lcvy-Carpenter-Handoll
discus, and the Mottram-Fitzgerald-
Sales-Fink-Reitz javelin.
1.C.4-A. Outlook
In the third department stars from
the four schools will be endeavoring
to show coaches and higher-ups
why they ought to go back East to
the 1.C.4-A. later in the month.
In addition to 1.C.1-A. and N.C.
A.A. prospects, there will be about
a dozen athletes competing tomor
row who are rated good chances
to go to Berlin for the Olympic
Games next summer.
Blackman's sore leg and the
doubtful condition of high jumper
Humbert Smith's ankle cut down
the chances Dink Templeton's men
had of coming back and beating
Brutus Hamilton's Bears. A rough
estimate gives Stanford 38 points
