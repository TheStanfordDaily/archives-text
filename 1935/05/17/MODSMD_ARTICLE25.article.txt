WASHINGTON, May 16 (/P).â€”The
inflationary $2,200,000,000 Patman
Bonus bill, hold captive since it was
passed by the Senate more than a
week ago, was finally .started on its
way to the V/hite House today to
meet a veto which President Roose*
volt flatly promised a few hours ear
lier.
With friends of the measure con
tending they had picked up strength
in their drive to over-ride the veto,
the White House moved to coun
ter-act reports that some Roose
velt leaders thought it wise to pass
the bill ov.'r the President's objec
tions.
Early Confides
Stephen Early, a White House
secretary, announced that President
Roosevelt would "present as force
ful an argument as he has" in ve
toing the bill and said it was the
Chief Executive's "earnest hope that
Congress will support tho veto."
Despite the claims of the Pat
man forces they had picked up
strength, administration leaders in
(he Senate said they knew of no
changes in the iinc-np and main
tained that the veto would be sus
tained. They have counted upon a
minimum of o5 votes to uphold the
President, or three more than
necessary.
The inflationary bonus measure
finally was released by Senator
Thomas of Oklahoma, leader of the
Patman forces in the Senate, with an
understanding that tho crucial test,
on over-riding the veto would not
come until the middle of next week.
Byrns Signs
The hotly disputed bill was rush
ed to the House, as soon as it was
released by the Senate, and signed
by Speaker Bynrs. But Vice-Presi
dent Garner had led the capitol, and
his office announced he would sign
i* tomorrow at 11 o'clock, assuring
its transmittal to the White House
by tomorrow night.
Members of the bonus bloc in
the Senate were somevvhat in con
flict on their claims. Huey Long
I flatly claimed to "have the votes,"
but none of the other backers of
the bill expressed such strong con
j frdence.
Senator Borah of Idaho said the
| bill was gaining strength, but. was
j still short of the required two-thirds.
He said tho lin"-up was so close that
Ithe outcome would be uncertain un
til the roll was called.
