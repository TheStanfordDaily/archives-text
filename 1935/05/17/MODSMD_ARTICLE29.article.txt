# Eighty People Hear Seventy Talk
## 
### 
Last night a political assembly was held*
in the Assembly Hall to introduce candidates
lor I lie student body election next Tuesday.
I*'or a week, campus opinions were written,
there was much discussion as to.how neces
sary such an assemblage was.
As a result of all the agitat'on, publicity,
and general commendation of the idea, a
magnificent total of'eighlv people showed up
lasl night to hear what next year's student
body oflicials had to say!
Ol' course the seventy-odd candidates were
there. Thev had to be or they would auto
matically lose their privilege of running. But
the idea of eighty people turning out to hear
seventy speak is worthy of a slapstick comedy,
not a student electorate which considers itself
capable of voting intelligently.
11 such is the interest of the campus in the
candidates' platforms, it would be much bet
ter to have no student election, but rather
allow a few qualified persons to choose next
year's office holders.
for as a result of lasl night's miserable
exhibition, about thirteen hundred people will
go to the polls Tuesday to vote, and most of
them will cast their ballots for the "cute"
candidate, or the "best" athlete —but very few
will know those who stood for something defi
nite, and took the trouble lo speak last night.
