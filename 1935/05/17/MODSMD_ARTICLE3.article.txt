University Public Health Service
have asked for the co-operation of
those living groups who are giving
dances and other social functions
over the week-end. The measles sit
uation has become very alarming;
the Palo Alto Hospital has been
completely filled, while the Isolation
Home is filled almost to capacity.
"We realize thai there will be
many complications due to con
tracts and previous arrangements;
but yet, in such an emergency, it
is very necessary that the few
groups giving social functions give
up their pians for tonight.
"The Executive Committee does
not wish to call off dates, but where
the health of the entire campu? is
directly or indirectly endangered,
we must ask this emergency co
operation. It is the sincere hope of
student leaders and public health
officials with whom I have conversed
that this request be met.
"Finally, I would also like to ask
the student body that it refrain from
visiting friends who are in bed. I
realize that this is a peculiar request,
but the hospital and isolation home
staff is overrun with human traffic.
Compliance with this wish would
serve to enhance the efforts of nurses
and physicians."
