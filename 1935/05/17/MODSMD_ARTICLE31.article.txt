Poor college radicals. Theirs is a sad lot.
They are heck'led, arrested, dunked, tossed
into jail. Ignominious insults are heaped upon
I heir heads, and very ripe tomatoes on oc
casions. And still they rise on every campus.
The latest case occurred at the I'niversity
ol Wisconsin. The League for Industrial De
mocracy adherents held a meeting, hut they
were interrupted in the law school building,
taken out to chilly Lake Mendota, and uncere
moniously ducked.

were responsible for Ihe dastardly act. Prob
ably it would be hard to determine just who
decided to give Ihe alleged radicals a bath.
But one thing is certain. II is difficult to
preach the doctrine of overthrow and revolt
when immersed in cold water. The remedy
could very well be tried out on over-talkative
congressmen.
