# Warfare at Other Colleges
## 
### 
Sounds of political strife arc wafted north
ward these days, echoes ol' recent student
body elections :il the Inivcrsity ol Southern
California. One student writes in the opinion
column ol the Dtiilii Trojan Hint he believes
he h;is been deprived of a vote illegally be
ciiuse he was registered in the wrong college,
or something to that elTect.
At Stanford we may be thankful for the
academic arrangement which permits us rea
sonable classification in scholastic depart
ments and schools, but still preserves a
closelv knit, homogeneous student bodv in

social lite. And while we are troubled with a
eertain amount of political strife and contro
versy, still we have far less trouble than is
experienced in the Oxford type of university.
