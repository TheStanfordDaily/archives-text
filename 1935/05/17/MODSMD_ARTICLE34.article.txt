# WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE NEW DEAL?
## 
### CROMPTON BANCS, Jr 
A general criticism which applies to nearly all the
New Deal is that they TRIED TO DO TOO MUCH TOO
SOON. The only way to build the temple of RE
COVERY IS FROM THE BOTTOM UP; IT CAN'T
BE BUILT FROM THE TOP DOWN. Yet that is just
what has been tried time after time. The main idea is
speed, and more speed. Plans are cooked up overnight,
put into effect the next morning with the help of a
big propaganda campaign. The people are led to ex
pect mircles. Of course the miracles don't happen;
everybody is disappointed and business takes another
nap.
That s what comes from not thinking things through
and not planning one step at a time. The American
public very seldom go up four or five stairs at a time.
Naturally the flop of the highly advertised cure-all
makes everyone think that the idea is all wrong,
when the system may be all that is the matter with it.
Then there are 100 many people in the New Deal
with an axe to grind. Some of these pet causes
become national policies. Look at what happened
to Professor Warren's commodity dollar—a col
lossal flop. Didn't do much harm, luckily. Other
panaceas are embodied in much New Deal legis
lation. With each man trying to get the ear of
the President for his favorite scheme, the White
House is beginning to look like a sultan's harem
with all the wives courting their master's favor.
Petty graft is growing rapidly, especially in the
FERA. If it isn't watched, a' scandal that will make
Teapot Dome look tame will soon pop up. This is
mainly due to the extension of the Spoils System to
relief and emergency agencies, where the system, more
than the men, breeds graft.
lo cap it all, each agency, each bureau, each depart
ment has its own corps of press agents grinding news
out by the truckful every day. Most of it is printed
somewhere sometime. It looks like each is speaking
for the government. When the stories conflict, as they
usually do, feel sorry for the poor newspaper reader.
This is the mess the President sits at the head of.
He is the only one in a position to co-ordinate it.
lie has several times given the job away. Nobody
has done it yet. If it isn't done, and done soon,
the machine will break down. Will Mr. Roose
velt break the machine, or will the machine break
him?
Tomorrow: Our President, Right or Wrong?

Petty graft is growing rapidly, especially in the

relief and emergency agencies, where the system, more
than the men, breeds graft.

A general criticism which applies to nearly all the
New Deal is that they TRIED TO DO TOO MUCH TOO
SOON. The only way to build the temple of RE
COVERY IS FROM THE BOTTOM UP; IT CAN'T
BE BUILT FROM THE TOP DOWN. Yet that is just
what has been tried time after time. The main idea is
speed, and more speed. Plans are cooked up overnight,
put into effect the next morning with the help of a
big propaganda campaign. The people are led to ex
pect mircles. Of course the miracles don't happen;
everybody is disappointed and business takes another
nap.
That s what comes from not thinking things through
and not planning one step at a time. The American
public very seldom go up four or five stairs at a time.
Naturally the flop of the highly advertised cure-all
makes everyone think that the idea is all wrong,
when the system may be all that is the matter with it.
