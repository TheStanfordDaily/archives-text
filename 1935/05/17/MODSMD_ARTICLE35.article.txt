New York has a law that makes it a public offense
to advocate or teach the doctrine of criminal anarchy,
which the act defines as the doctrine "that organized
government should be overthrown by force or violence
or by unlawful means."
A man named Gitlow was convicted of advocating
that doctrine by distributing a manifesto. It was ar
gued before the court that Bitlow was merely teaching
a doctrine which might not be fulfilled until some
future date.
This position was held untenable by ihe Supreme
Court which said: "A single revolutionary spark may
kindle a fire that, smouldering for a time, may burst
into a sweeping and destructive conflagration. It can
not be fsaid that the state is acting arbitrarily or un
reasonably when in the exercise of its judgment as to
the measures necessary to protect the public peace and
safety it seeks to extnguish the spark without waiting
until it has enkindled the flame or blazed into the
conflagration." Gitlow was convicted of advocating
a doctrine by distributing a manifesto.
Professor Arthur M. Cathcart observes in this
connection: "Suppose the law had forbidden Gitlow
to organize or assist in organizing or knowingly
hemming or remaining a member of -,n organi
zation which advocated or taught the doctrine of
criminal anarchy? In such a case the advocacy of
anarchistic action hy force and violence would
he one step farther removed and a little more in
direct than in Gitluw's c*we: but would it there
fore be beyond the prohibitory power of the
stale?"
Substituting criminal syndicalism for anarchy, the
California Criminal Syndicalism Act Ls just such a law.
which defines criminal syndicalism as "any doctrine
or precept advocating, teaching, aiding or abetting the
commission of crime, sabotage, or unlawful acts of
force and violence or unlawful methods ol terrorism
as a means of accomplishing a change in industrial
ownership or control or affecting any particular
change."
The law professor points out that if the California
aet stopped with punishing the advocacy of that doc
trine it would be constitutional under the decision of
Gitlow's case, but like Similar state acts, it goes further.
It provides that any person is guilty of a felony who
"organizes or assists in organizing, or knowingly be
comes a member of any organization, group, society,
or assemblage of persons organized or &f.sembled to
advocate, teach or aid and abet criminal syndicalism."
The Supreme Court of California has upheld the
ronstitu<ionalit> of the act. and also that the jury
was warranted in finding the Industrial Workers
of the World such an organization as was con
templated hy the act.
In the welt-known California case of the People
vs. Miss Whitney, who was convincted under the
state syndicalism act by the lower court and district
courl of appeal, the case was finally carried to the
United States Supreme Court. The highest tribunal of
America rejected the contention that 'he Criminal
Syndicalism act was repugnant to the due process
clause as a restraint upon the rights of free speech,

New York has a law that makes it a public offense
to advocate or teach the doctrine of criminal anarchy,
which the act defines as the doctrine "that organized
government should be overthrown by force or violence
or by unlawful means."
A man named Gitlow was convicted of advocating
that doctrine by distributing a manifesto. It was ar
gued before the court that Bitlow was merely teaching
a doctrine which might not be fulfilled until some
future date.
This position was held untenable by ihe Supreme
Court which said: "A single revolutionary spark may
kindle a fire that, smouldering for a time, may burst
into a sweeping and destructive conflagration. It can
not be fsaid that the state is acting arbitrarily or un
reasonably when in the exercise of its judgment as to
the measures necessary to protect the public peace and
safety it seeks to extnguish the spark without waiting
until it has enkindled the flame or blazed into the
conflagration." Gitlow was convicted of advocating
a doctrine by distributing a manifesto.
Professor Arthur M. Cathcart observes in this
connection: "Suppose the law had forbidden Gitlow
to organize or assist in organizing or knowingly
hemming or remaining a member of -,n organi
zation which advocated or taught the doctrine of
criminal anarchy? In such a case the advocacy of
anarchistic action hy force and violence would
he one step farther removed and a little more in
direct than in Gitluw's c*we: but would it there
fore be beyond the prohibitory power of the
stale?"
Substituting criminal syndicalism for anarchy, the
California Criminal Syndicalism Act Ls just such a law.
which defines criminal syndicalism as "any doctrine
or precept advocating, teaching, aiding or abetting the
commission of crime, sabotage, or unlawful acts of
force and violence or unlawful methods ol terrorism
as a means of accomplishing a change in industrial
ownership or control or affecting any particular
change."
The law professor points out that if the California
aet stopped with punishing the advocacy of that doc
trine it would be constitutional under the decision of
Gitlow's case, but like Similar state acts, it goes further.
It provides that any person is guilty of a felony who
"organizes or assists in organizing, or knowingly be
comes a member of any organization, group, society,
or assemblage of persons organized or &f.sembled to
advocate, teach or aid and abet criminal syndicalism."
The Supreme Court of California has upheld the
ronstitu<ionalit> of the act. and also that the jury
was warranted in finding the Industrial Workers
of the World such an organization as was con
templated hy the act.
In the welt-known California case of the People
vs. Miss Whitney, who was convincted under the
state syndicalism act by the lower court and district
courl of appeal, the case was finally carried to the
United States Supreme Court. The highest tribunal of
America rejected the contention that 'he Criminal
