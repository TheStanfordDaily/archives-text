# BULL SESSION
## POLITICS ON PARADE 
### 
This is written before the Farm J
Election Rally. And doubtless by i
the time this is printed, many gems :
of truth and beauty will have fallen
from the lips of the candidates for
student body office. But without !
benefit of such political pearls much I
remains to be said about the field of I
men and women which faces the
Stanford democracy.
The derbies have already been
tossed into the ring. Yet more im- |
portant than gazing at the nretty:
black and brown chapeaux labeled
"Row." and "Independent," and
"Hall," is the interesting job of
lifting up the derbies to see what
lies beneath.
In the three presidential platforms, j
there is much that is safely ambigu- j
ous and some that rings of sincerity.
On the New Theater question, two !
of the candidates have taken some .
sort of position: one is definitely'
committed to support of the financial
scheme under which Stanford stu
dents are to pay the Theater Dollar
(for an indefinite period), the Union
Dollar (for an indefinite period),
$10,000 immediately—s32s,ooo in all
(borrowed at 5 per cent from the
Board of Trustees). A second of the
candidates has said that the Union
Dollar and Theater Dollar schemes
are "harmful measures" but has not
indicated definitely his stand in the ;

] matter. The third candidate has not
| yet spoken. And we doubt that the
. two other candidates listed are seri
! ous contenders, especially since one
i is a freshman.
As important as the candidate's
| stand on definite issues is your per
-1 sonal estimate of his capabilities. The
president of the student body will
be called upon to lead an Ex Com
mittee. Will your favorite (who
might be a demon with the women,
i or a "swell Joe") click (tn Ex Com
mittee—for that is his big job? Will
| he present matters to the council in
intelligent fashion? Will he, for in
stance, swing Ex Committee into in
dorsement of a school ring, without
making definite provision that the
; ring be of any certain quality?—for
| that is what one student body presi
| dent did. (And the ring is now
1 showing silver threads among the
i gold.) Will he give the student body
| real leadership in the face of "pres
sure" from certain higher-ups?
Unless you beiieve sincerely that
the candidate of your dreams stacks
up on such matters, it is traitorous
to Stanford University to cast your
vote on the basis of the candidate's
|or your personal affiliations. "Trai
torous" is a horrid word, but it's
1 than on paper. Stanford is no place
worse in a student body election
for ward-heeling.

As important as the candidate's

president of the student body will
be called upon to lead an Ex Com
mittee. Will your favorite (who
might be a demon with the women,
i or a "swell Joe") click (tn Ex Com
mittee—for that is his big job? Will

intelligent fashion? Will he, for in
stance, swing Ex Committee into in
dorsement of a school ring, without
making definite provision that the
; ring be of any certain quality?—for

Unless you beiieve sincerely that
the candidate of your dreams stacks
up on such matters, it is traitorous
to Stanford University to cast your
vote on the basis of the candidate's

worse in a student body election
for ward-heeling.

This is written before the Farm J
Election Rally. And doubtless by i
the time this is printed, many gems :
of truth and beauty will have fallen
from the lips of the candidates for
student body office. But without !
benefit of such political pearls much I
remains to be said about the field of I
men and women which faces the
Stanford democracy.
The derbies have already been
tossed into the ring. Yet more im- |
portant than gazing at the nretty:
black and brown chapeaux labeled
"Row." and "Independent," and
"Hall," is the interesting job of
lifting up the derbies to see what
lies beneath.
In the three presidential platforms, j
there is much that is safely ambigu- j
ous and some that rings of sincerity.
On the New Theater question, two !
of the candidates have taken some .
sort of position: one is definitely'
committed to support of the financial
scheme under which Stanford stu
dents are to pay the Theater Dollar
(for an indefinite period), the Union
Dollar (for an indefinite period),
$10,000 immediately—s32s,ooo in all
(borrowed at 5 per cent from the
Board of Trustees). A second of the
candidates has said that the Union
Dollar and Theater Dollar schemes
are "harmful measures" but has not
indicated definitely his stand in the ;

] matter. The third candidate has not
| yet spoken. And we doubt that the

! ous contenders, especially since one
