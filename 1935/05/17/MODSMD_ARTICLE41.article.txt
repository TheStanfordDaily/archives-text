"HORNETS' NEST," by Helen
Ash lon. MacMillan. $2.50. At (lie
Stanford Bookstore.
"Hornets' Nest" is a book which
smacks of the Backbone of the Brit
ish Empire seated in a musty, dank,
draughty Victorian dining - room,
; making a meal upon cold, half
i cooked mutton. The setting is an old-
I fashioned, ill-kempt, poorly-run
nursing home; the plot is simply a
! rehash of the "string of circum
stance" idea.
When Sarah Moreland goes to the
"Laurels" for an appendicitis opera
tion, the "Hornets' Nest" begins to
foment, and the lives of everyone
connected with the operation are
irrevocably altered. The story re
! volves around three doctors: Sir
Robert Bernadine, desperately
struggling to maintain his reputa
tion when he realizes that he is out
j moded; Basil Cotsall, kindly, ineffi
cient family physician, who does
very well when he is only required
to soothe old ladies; and Adam
Spens, vigorous, unhappy, uncertain
i young assistant.
Sarah Moreland is clearly the
only character of the story who ap
proaches normality, yet she alone
1 is repeatedly spoken of as "neu
rotic." Adam Spens is a character
! poorly drawn; the author has con
fusedly managed her description of
him as a man trained in one of
London's best hospitals, and excel
lent in his Held; this contrasts oddly
with his pre-eminent ineffectually,
' social awkwardness, and inability to
face any situation.
"Hornets' Nest" has little to rec
-1 ommend it; it is undoubtedly an ex
cellent picture of small town gos
| sip, but its characters are so pal
-1 pably overdrawn as to make the en
tire action verge on the ridiculous.
