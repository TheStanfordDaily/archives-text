## Card Star in Good Shape For British Match 
### 
ST. ANNE'S-ON-THE-SEA, Eng
| land, May 16 (IP). —Reaching the
1 peak of his form again, just before
! they start shooting for keeps, W.
! Lawson Little, British and Ameri
; can amateur golf champion, gave
| England a painful vision of another
■ Prestwick today by touring the
I Royal Lytham course, where the
; British amateur championship will
i be played next week, in a spectacu
-1 lar round of 71 today. Par for the
| short but tricky layout is 69.
j Playing with the Scot, Jock Mc
j Lean, the man everybody says Little
i will have to beat if he successfully
defends his title, the husky Ameri
! can shot the day's best round despite
| two penalty strokes.
McLean, who experienced trouble
| with his driving, turned in a 73 in
j the cold wind which swept the
| course, still wet from yesterday's
! hard rain.
Although (he club secretary claims
. the Royal Lytham course par is 69,
! Little's score under American rules
; figures one under perfect figures.
I Three of the course's "par 4" holes
measure well over 450 yards.
"It's a par 72 as far as I'm con
: cerned," said Little.
