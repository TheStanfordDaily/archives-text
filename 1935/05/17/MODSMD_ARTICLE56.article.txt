# Life in Captivity Fatal To Alby, Novel Albino Gopher
## 
### ROBERT EISENBACH 
Alby, who might have led the life
of a human millionnaire in Stan
ford's biological laboratories, and
who was catapulted into unwanted
fame, is dead today. Dwight Fiske
might say that Alby was just an or
dinary gopher—to her own kind. But
to John Scrabbo, gardener on the
Woodside estate of James F. Waters,
San Francisco automobile dealer, she
was an albino, much whiter than the
Daily's stock.
The irony in Alby's life is that she
didn't want to be different from
other gophers, according to the way
she preserved her privacy. But f;.te
picked her out for high honor and a
glutton's death.
Put on Pillow
She was caught Tuesday by the
Waters' house-cat, and clawed into
insensibility. Gardener Scrabbo put
her on a soft white pillow and
gave her the culinary works. People
came to see her, important people
like Stanford professors. They ex
amined her, shook their heads, eulo
gized her as unique, a challenger to
the albino frog, now feted in New
York's scientific institutes.

I There was even a movement to
I make Alby queen in a gopher male
harem in college biology labs, but
j she never lived to see full glory. A
i combination of clawing, pampering,
! and overindulgence was too much
| for her constitution.
Now she Will be mounted and
hung above the Waters' fireside—
I but, doggone it, she'll never again
bury her tusks in a juicy rose bush
I or raise hell with a front lawn.
Professor Not Impressed
Everyone was pretty much im
! pressed with Alby but Dr. Frank
j Walter Weymouth, professor of
physiology. He's got Alby's num
i ber—the number of her chromo-
I somes—and, anyway, he's heard of
j albino gophers before.
j "Like white rabbits, albino go
phers are just genetic freaks," he
(explained today. "They lesult when
the gene carrying pigment charac
teristics loses out in prenatal devel-
I opment."
Alby's scientific value is doubtful,
| he believes. "We are pretty .sure of
j I he biological actions making al-
I binos. Furthermore, we haven't any

experimental gophers at Stanford to
mate with Alby and produce speci
mens to be used in research."
Had Alby lived and multiplied,
her children would probably have
been just baker's-dozen gophers.
"The albino characteristics are re
cessive," according to Dr. Weymouth,
"and might not occur again in Al
by's line for generations."
A machine has been perfected to
make as many as 50,000 glass bottles
a day.
