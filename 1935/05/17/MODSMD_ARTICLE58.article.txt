## Measles Epidemic Strikes Business School Team 
### 
MONDAY'S GAMES
Softball semifinals — Phi Delta
Theta vs. Phi Delta Phi, 4 o'clock;
Breakers vs. Dekes, 5 o'clock. (Both
games on frosh football field.)
Hardball — Alpha Delta Phi vs. El
Campo, 4 o'clock, frosh baseball field.
Delta Kappa Epsilon advanced to
the intramural softball semifinals
yesterday by taking a forfeit from
the Business School. Unable to play
Wednesday because of a measles at
tack, the grads failed to appear in
sufficient numbers for the game.
By virtue of this victory, the
Dekes will play the Breakers Mon
day for the right to challenge the
winner of Monday's Phi Delta Theta
vs. Phi Delta Phi game in Tuesday's
final. The Deke-Breaker contest is
doped as a toss-up, but the Phi
Delts, with Al Semmelroth in box,
rate a slight edge over the lawyers.
In the absence of a league op
ponent, the Dekes won a six-in
ning practice game, 7 to 1, from
a team composed of what Business
School men did show up, and a
few others present. Dick Kelley
set back this independent team
with little trouble, and showed
some pitching form that may
trouble the Breakers Monday. The
following players took part in the
game:
Dekes — Maentz, Kelley, Jonas,
Anderson, Cowing, Bost, Steiner,
Moser, V. Stewart.
Independents — Murphy, Gerrard,
Godfrey, Quade, Frates, Gates, Ham
mond, Cox, F. Stewart.
El Campo and Alpha Delta Phi
were scheduled to play off a tie
game yesterday, but this tilt was
postponed until Monday. The win
ner will then compete with Theta
Chi and Sigma Nu, champions of the
two other regulation ball leagues,
in the finals later next week.
