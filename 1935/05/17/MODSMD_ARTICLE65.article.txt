The National Chamber of Com
; merce, an enterprising organization
; as it is run under the new govern
; merit, has gone in for American ad
vertising tactics on a large scale. The
i increasing number of tourists who
| visit Mexico every year proves that
I their efforts are not in vain. I wit
| nessed one of their schemes in op
' eration: A bright young Mexican
i woman, who was evidently at the
| head of the group, and two Ameri
i can cameramen were taking pictures
J of the bay and other spots of in
, terest.
Everything was perfectly legiti—
! mate until they rented colored
j blankets and other native garb
j (which the natives hardly ever
! wear) for several of the hangers-on,
i whom they then stationed at con
-1 venient posts. And away went the
| cameras, grinding out film of the
native Mexican in his natural habi-
I tat to lure the unsuspecting tourist.
| They could well have saved them
j selves that trouble; there is such a
superabundance of real beauty in
Mexico that one doesn't need to
! stoop to the artificial.
So far I haven't been able to
get inside any churches. The
j government has closed them cn
i tirely in the states of Sonora and
i Sinaloa. The first thing the trav
! eler sees on approaching a town is
the outline of the cathedra} or
church silhouetted against the sky.
I At a closer range he can make
i out the inevitable double spires,
j two extended arms, supplicating
the mercy of God. But when he
j arrives at the massive wooden

f doors, covered with interesting j
hand-carved designs, he finds
them barred. Huge iron grills •
cover the windows. The only
open apertures are the small peep- ,
holes, from which the defenders
fire at the invaders in time of war.
But a country which has been
Catholic for over 400 years is not
i easily, if at all, to be deprived of
what it considers the cause and end ,
of its existence. The men might !
| submit to a change, but the women i
I never. From every neck, almost
i without exception, is suspended the
I glittering cross of gold. Beggar or i
aristocrat, she bows her head with
' deepest reverence as she passes the
' Mother Church, from whose arms
she is now withheld. The men, with
the exception of the political em
ployees, tip their hats and beseech a
I blessing, as their fathers and grand
; fathers did in the generations past. '•
Tepic.
The ancient capital of Nayarit. To- ;
1 day it seems no different than it ;
! must have been when the first iriis
i sidnaries departed for the North to
j establish the chain of missions which
! extends to Northern California. Per-
I haps a few more low adobe build-
I ings, some bathtubs, automobiles,
'but that is about all. The- same
cobblestones still pave the same nar
i row streets, over which pass long
eared, moth-eaten burros, laden
I with charcoal, vegetables, and milk
from the outskirts of town.
My hotel was built in true Mex
