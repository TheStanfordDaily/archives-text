fortunately made it appear as

the B.A.C. to duplicate the $1,000,000
Edwards Field. That is an impos

The leg injury which forced
Captain A1 Blackmail out of the
Fresno Relays last Saturday, and
which has taken all the smooth
ness out of his running during the
p-vst four weeks, occurred on An
gfcll Field the Monday after the
U.C.L.A. meet, ft had oeen a
rainy week-end, and the track
was muddy and covered with pud
dles. But Captain A1 knew that
he must take stiff workouts then,
early in April, to put him in shape
for the coming big meets and na
tional competition.
As it result he started his usual
early week sprinting. But just as he
was coming off the north curve he
felt hi:~ right leg slip on the squishy
track and a sharp pull in his thigh.
Already standing all the pressure it
could bear, a muscle, or muscle
sheath, had given way with the jerk
caused by the slippery surface.
Think of the proportions that the
results of the muddy track have al
ready taken for Captain A1 and
Stanford's 1935 track.
