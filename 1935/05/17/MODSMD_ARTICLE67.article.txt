# SHIN SPLINTS, PULLED MUSCLES. WRECKED ARCHES
## 
### 
That the Angell Field oval is defi
nitely harmful and dangerous to a
runner's legs has been shown in
numerous other ways. Nearly every
man in his first year of running on
ihe covered bricks of Angell Field
suffers shin-splints, painful tearing
of the tissue joining muscle to bone,
which requires weeks to heal and
which is an ailment usually worry
ing only those who pound sidewalks
on cross-city runs and the like.
Many Stanford runners have
found that running on the Angell
Field oval has torn down their
arches. For others the pounding re
sults in sore calves, causing the
runner to "tie-up." Watch it in
Stanford's present distance men. The
hardness of the track was partially
responsible for the leg injury which
wrecked Ben Eastman's last col
legiate year and marred his Olympic
Games chances.
