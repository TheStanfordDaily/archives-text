# Farm Leaders Favor Repairing of Angell Field
## BOARD MEMBERS FAVOR PROPOSAL TO REBUILD TRACK B.A.C. Will Meet Sunday lo Discuss Plan 
### Gordon Frest 
Visions of a new Stanford track
and field coursed through the cam
pus last night as word came from
, B.A.C. General Manager A1 Mas
| ters' office that the Angell Field
reconstruction program would defi
nitely be put. before the board at. its
! meeting Sunday night.
And the whole affair brightened
again when Masters and the three
student members of the board,
j Marvie *ohn, Jim Triolo, and Stan
Anderson, announced their con
victions that the new track was an
i absolute necessity and would re
ceive their support Sunday night.
I ft was a far different story from
that of three days ago when Masters
said he had no plan to bring up the
measure and the board had no too
great interest in the-affair.
Triolo in Favor
Triolo commented early yesterday
with a decisive statement favoring
the measure. "There is no doubt in
anyone's mind that Angell Field is
sadly in need of repairs, nor is there
doubt that our track plant suffers by
comparison with the new Edwards
Field at Berkeley, f realize the need
for the improvements and will favor
| the move."
Kahn and Anderson were not
hesitant with their ideas. Kahn
came forth with a decisive "I'll
support it." and Anderson wasted
J no time in declaring: "When it
comes up Sunday night I'll stand
behind it."
So with the three student mem
bers of the board pulling for a new
I Angell Field it is being hoped by an
interested campus that the remain
ing members, three faculty and three
I alumni, will join the ranks Sunday
night.
Comments Numerous
From every side, statements pour
ed in yesterday assuring members
of the- B.A.C. that the Angell Field
1 that Stanford's track teams train on
today is too far remote from the
Angell Field that was Stanford's
new pride and joy 'way back in 1907,
to be classed as a first rate track.
Athletes from every major sport
came openly to stand for the cause
of Stanford's track squad.
First baseman Gordy Mallatratt
I gave this reasoning. "It seems only
natural that the major sports in a
university like Stanford should have
good equipment. Three of those four
j sports are so equipped. Track, the
: fourth, should be entitled to the same
if the student body expects, any ac
complishments from the squad."
Hoop Men Favorable
Basket bailers Howell Turner and
Dinty Moore thought similarly. "Our
national champion football team has
; ene of the finest gridirons on the
; coast, our baseball nine and the
; outstanding collegiate diamond in
the West, our basketball squad an
excellent practice pavilion, and it is
i only fair and just that we give io
our track team the opportunity ac
! corded these other sports."
All American footballer Bob Rey
nolds also spends considerable time
in the Angell Field weight pits as a
member of the track team. His
| words are these.
"The shot and discus pit on An
gell Field are constructed of ordi
nary clay, ami for that reason
practice on the weights is im
i possible during the Tainy season.

Footing in the circle is risky, and
measurement is inaccurate. The
discus pit particularly, constructed
7 or 8 feet below the surface of
(he track, receives no drainage
whatsoever.
And from Reynolds' football team
j mate and all-American, Bobby
Grayson, comes a statement based
upon intimate connection v/ith the
einderpath and its Stanford inhab
• itants.
Grayson's Comment
"Most of the track men themselves
are of the opinion that the loss of
the Big Meet was a direct result of
the shoddy condition of Angell Field.
Continued rains kept ihe track in
puddles for a couple of months, and
then when the sun came out it hard
ened into something resembling ce
ment. Now if there were proper
. drainage there would have been no
j puddles, and if there were proper
' composition there would be no ce
i menl.
"Puddles resulted in poor condi-
S tion; hard track resulted in shin-
I splints—then Cal drubbed us.
"Also, if boys like Kirkpatrick
I and McGuire realize what they're
| getting into they'll listen to Cal
j alumni and go where they can work
j out under ideal conditions."
i Thus it becomes obvious that Stan
; ford's track team stands not alone
iin its plea for better facilities. An
I eager student body of athletes and
| spectators await the B.A.C. deci-
I sion Sunday night.
