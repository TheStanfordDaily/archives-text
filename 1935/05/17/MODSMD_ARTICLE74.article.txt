## 
### MILLARD BROWNE 
It will probably be a miniature
edition of the mighty "Even Aveng
ers" that defends the championship
of the I.C.A.A.A.A. for Stanford ihis
year, indications direct from Robert
Lyman Templeton last night -howed.
"There is a chance that only
three track men will go to Bos-
Ion," Dink said. The small group
will embark next Saturday, in
time lor two days' workout before
the historic meet opens on May 31.
The trio that is sure to go—Sammy
Klopstock, Jim Reynolds, and John
ny Mottram—may be abetted by two
or three more, but the squad defi
nitely will not total over six or seven.
Levy Wails Decision
| Phil Levy is still a cinch to com
! pete in the 1.C.4-A. if he is declared
eligible. Templeton is awaiting de
j cision of the national moguls on the
l junior college transfer ruling. Levy,
who attended San Mateo J.C. last
' year, may be barred from competi
' lion this season.
Captain Al Blackman, who failed
to show up for practice yesterday,
probably will not go, Templeton
indicated, unless his muscle injury
; shows a decided improvement in
the California Intercollegiates to-
I

morrow.
Humbert Smith, Stanford's other
current cripple, will be included in
the traveling group in case he hits
around 6:3 and appears to be coming
Lack into high jumping form.
Dean M \v Go
The two most promising additional
candidates at present are Ray Dean
and Dud Sales. Dean, gradually im
proving from an early injury, is be
coming more and more sure of points
in each meet, and may be ready for

the "big time" after this week-end.
Sales' performances have been
made somewhat insignificant by the
wealth of potent javelin throwers on
the Coast, but it is believed that if
he surpasses 210 feet Saturday he
will be taken, with a reasonable as
surance that he can place in the
Boston competition.
