# HELP STAMP OUT A DANGEROUS EPIDEMIC
## 
### 
A precarious situation faces Stanford I'niversity (his
morning. The measles epidemic lias become rampant on
the campus, and il is no exaggeration to say that half the
campus faces the disease before the week, if any more
than minimum social contact takes place on the Farm
this week-end.
It is imperative that every organization planning social
functrons this week-end cancel them. Calling oIT an en
gagement is not serious, but being confined for over a week
near finals is another story.
Rather than face a possibility of campus quarantine, it
is up to every student to co-operate before the epidemic
becomes even more menacing.
