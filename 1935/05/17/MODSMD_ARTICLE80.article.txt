# CAMPUS OPINION
## FORMER TRACK CAPTAIN SPEAKS 
### 
| The Editor, Sir:
| It certainly seems to me that Stan
; ford should have a complete and new
j track unit. Here we have the best '
! track coach in the country, but one i
iof the worst collegiate tracks. The ;
cinders and clay have disappeared
i long ago; all there's left is a small
■ layer of dirt and a brick foundation,
i The track plant is the poorest piece
i of athletic equipment on the campus, j
lAn outsider looking at the track
| would think that it had been dis
| carded several years ago, for all ;
he would see would be an old port
able circus bleacher overlooking an
j oval that is as hard as bricks and a
I field that is covered with weeds and
i wild hay.
Track here at Stanford is slipping
; and will continue to slip until a
i decent place is provided where the
j men can work' out and hold their
■ meets. I'm surprised that the inter- j
jest in track has continued as long j
as it has. For the past, several years, j
| workouts haven't been a pleasure;
| the fellows had to force themselves ,
ito run and get in<o condition. What
' fun is there in doing your exercises
; on a field that is covered with stick
! ers and weeds? Furthermore, what
! is the use of showing a prospective I
' trackman an oval which offers him I
no inducements for coming to Stan- »
j ford?
For $40,000 the B.A.C. could build j
a complete plant that would equal !
any on the Coast, and would have !
the added advantage of being so |
situated as to have practically no !
hindering winds.
Sinccrcly,
