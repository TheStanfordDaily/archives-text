i The Editor, Sir:
Many great athletes have prac- j
ticed and competed on Angell Field.
Now the track is so shot full of go- |
phcr holes you take your life into j
' your hands to walk across it. During !
| the many years since it was built i
the rains have eroded it off down lo j
■ the brick foundations and it has
, grown so hard that Leo Mayer, the
1 trainer, spends half his time taping
I shin splints.
Angell Field was named in honor
i of th.it great supporter of track, the
| friend of every track man, Dr. An
-1 gell. The track is not an honor to
him now. It's a disgrace. . . . With
1 the Olympic Games coming up next
j year it becomes a necessity to have
a new track plant as soon as possible
if Stanford wishes to be represented
i in Berlin.
They do like track over there at

I California ... it is reported they
have to kick the fellows of! the
] track for dinner, while here at An
| gell Field the favorite track event is
1 chasing gopher holes. . . . Stanford's
1 chances should not be sacrificed by
I having to practice on an ancient
: track, the washed-away brick foun
dation in places, attacked from be
low by the gophers and from above
; by the rain and sun, making it sloshy
and hard as a brick by turns. ... It
: would be extremely short-sighted,
, with track looming as the major
sport in 1936, if Stanford did not
j rebuild Angel I Field.
Sincerely,
