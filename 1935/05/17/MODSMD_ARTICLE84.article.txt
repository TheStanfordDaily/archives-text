# Women's Old Gym Serves As Woodpecker Dwelling
## 
### CATHLEEN HAYES 
To an impartial tmd unbiased ey-,
it may seem that there are many
, queer birds on the Stanford cam
; pus, but forgetting the ones apt to
appear in an 8 o'clock Monday class,
there are also numerous true mem
bers of the bird family flitting
' around.
| Even though spring quarter brings
a desire to get away into the hills,
i and studying nature can always
J serve as a good excuse, it isn't nec
! cssary to wander far from the cam
pus to discover them. Open win
! clows in classrooms have proved a
' lure lalely, and a vagrant bird can
i demoralize a class very nicely for a
j few minutes.
Woodpeckers Plentiful
But the woodpeckers are the ones
i most noticeable, for they leave their
! trademark wherever they go. As far
j as they are concerned, the depres
j sion began long ago, when the
| trustees first planned a stone; Quad.
| To add insult to injury, not a single
i rinrmitnrv nr ntlior Tlniv(<i Â«sil v vtrne-

ture is of edible material!
So the destitute woodpecker is
forced to go Row, where good old
utilitarian wood is still used, and he
finds his happy hunting ground at
the old women's gymnasium, stand
ing alone and forlorn.
Old Home Left
There was once a time when mem
bers of the 500 romped around that
floor in bloomers, but with the erec
tion of a new and modern gymna
sium, the old home was left as a
rendezvous for the Stanford band,
copyrcading classes, and woodpeck
t rs.
Hare the woodpecker has an un
limited field, as he makes his holes
in which to deposit seeds and- nuts
for future reference. That he has
made good use of his opportunities is
evident from the array of holes
which looks as if the R.O.T.C. had
mistaken the building for a shoot
ing target. So the old gym, forgot
ten by many, now serves its pur
pose as a bird sanctuary.
