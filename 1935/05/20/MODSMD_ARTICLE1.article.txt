## 10,000 Alumni in Blather Over the Way Coaches Spend Their Dough 'TO HELL,' SAYS TINY Beer Stains on Trophies Cut Price, Damit 
### 
Fears that Stanford University
would have to disband its prospec
tive 'championship football squad
next year were expressed today in
authoritative quarters as 10,000 dis
gruntled alumni in polite terms in
formed the university and the B.A.C.
collectively where they could stuff
the athletic situation.
"The way it looks now," said Cor
nelius Endymion "Tiny" Scrawny
hill in an exclusive interview with a
Dippy cub last night, "our all-Amer
j icans will have to sell their silver
loving cups to stay in school. And
of course the beer stains on the cups
cut the price considerably."
Will Carry the Mail
"Hamilton, Alustiza, Reynolds,
and Moscrip are definitely through,
but Grayson can still carry the mail.
Now that Bobby is getting married,
we ought to raise his salary, but he
may never make another 5 yards off
tackle. Marriage and football are
just like ants in your pants, they
v don't go together."
The predicament arose as an af
termath of the scholarship com
mittee's peremptorily firing young
Robin Lindsey as soon as the bas
ketball season was over.
"We gotta cut expenses," said a
spokesman for the committee. "No
workee, no payee."
"What the hell," was Dink Tem
pieton's comment. "Lindsey was u
broad jumper too, wasn't he?"
Business Is Business
"Now you know Dink," interrupt
ed the spokesman. "Track don't make
no money. Business is business.
And besides, we gave you Tharp and
Anderson, didn't we?"
"Yeah, and where is Williamson?"
was the coach's final comment.
"But if the blanket y-blankcd
; luinni won't kick through, what can
we do?" was the spokesman's re
joinder. "They're pretty sore after
buying athletes for 10 years, the
university takes all the gate re
ceipts and builds women's gyms and
golf courses that nobody but Rocke
feller can play on. Why can't you do
like Wolter? When he wants a schol
arship lie digs down in his jeans and
pays for it himself."
"And it's ali money up the creek,
judging by the results."
