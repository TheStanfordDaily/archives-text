# Gal Loses Bathing Suit Strap as 16 Men Die
## 
### 
Sixteen Stanford men were
drowned yesterday afternoon over
at the women's swimming pool.
Every Sunday afternoon is open
house at the pools, and yesterday
three hundred and seventy-five
love-starved Branner men came hot
footing it over to see how the women
are being poured into their bathing
suits this season.
Everything was under control
until the sloe-eyed little Japanese
girl who cleans up the Union on
Saturday mornings lost her swim
ming suit shoulder strap. Pande
monium reigned when the 375 men
at once dove in the water to hide
their embarrassment.
The 16 men who died could not
find their way up to the top of the
pool because their eyes were lightly
shut, an official autopsy verdict late
last night showed. Nothing hap
pened to the little Chinese girl, ex
cept that her brown little body is
even browner than usual, and she is
to be decorated by the Branner
Club. It happens that one of those
killed was Milt Friedman, a glut if
ever there was one.
