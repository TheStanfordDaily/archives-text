# HOOVER IN JAIL
## 'Beat It', Says Orange Julius To Ray, Herbie Jacoban Greatly Ired At Bad News that Hoover Wants To Blow Air 
### Howe Vera Bourgeois 
AND WILBUR
PLAN TO
MOVE

ON WASHINGTON
TO PUT
NEW DEALERS IN
«

Orange Julius Jacobin Jacoban
yesterday burst wide open with his
"Back to Washington with Hoover
and Wilbur, the Dirty Bums" move
ment.
Resulting from the announcement
carried in the adjoining column that
Hoover will deliver the commence
ment address at the graduating ex
ercises, which Orange Julius consid
ers to be the "last straw in a long
line of super - irritating publicity
stunts," the "Back to Washington"
movement swung into action.
This new movement refutes Bill
Corbus' old-time "Back to the Farm"
movement which was so effective in
getting Herbert and Ray L. back on
the campus.
Orange Julius began bouncing
higher than one of Beltramo's eggs
on receipt of the. "infuriating''
news of Hoover's speaking.
"Well, the 'Bark to Washington'
movement swings into action to
day! I'll blast 'em right outa here
and back to the D. of C., where
the.v belong. They can ream the
nation, but they can't toy with my
alma mater," Jacoban said.
The new movement is scientifically
designed to counteract the appar
ently insurmountable evils con
concocted by the two unemployed's
publicity stunts. Everything from
rape, mayhem and murder has taken
place around here since the return
of the illustrious duo.
Some 16 deaths from auto acci
dents, two suicides, god knows how
many murders, and the dying off of
professors like flies can all l>e laid
at the doors of the famed unem
ployed partners in crime, Orange
Julius was quick to point out.
"It's Godawful"
More women than you can shake
a bamboo pole at have invaded the
Farm as part of a scheme to end
j Stanford's depression. A Wilbur
brain child, the idea of getting . r >0()
more women, has wrought havoc
with the purses of the Rough. Charn
. pagne tasted dimwits purr that they
, "just adore the Palace, or the Fran
jtie or the Mark, or even the Opera."
I As a result the Rough finds himself
, even poorer than he ever dreamt of
being. The administration exploits
women, the women take the poor
Rough for a never-to-be-forgotten
ride. "It's godawful," gnashes Or
ange Julius.
The campus is lousy with measles
the kind that Hoover picked up in
Belgium. They are called Belgian
or Hoover measles, obviously.
Have you ever seen such a winter
for the past 30 years? In spite of
;; lything that Dean Mary, the Holy
Yost can do to curb the wild orgy
o>' publicity stunts, women like Ram
ming sprout up from Lagunita like
li sty mushrooms. Ramming outdid
lhe weather in attention getting.
Herbert and Ray were mighty upset.
They thought their weather manipu
u tions would be the greatest stunt.
The two most prominent members
of America's .50 million unemployed
t ven failed to co-operate with A1
Rothy Wothy's campaign to enforce
the mile-and-a-half liquor law.
They flouted the effort openly when
their names headed a petition at
Beltramo's which demanded —"Let
beer stay where it is!"
"Their publicity stunts are heinous
c; imes. Let us all unite and ship
in back!" Orange Julius finished,
(«>,-getting the Lamson murder and
tin- New York Life's losing 5900 sub
rericrs as soon as Hoover got on the
hoard of directors.

The Russian Crud and Stanford
Blue Grut are synonyms.
