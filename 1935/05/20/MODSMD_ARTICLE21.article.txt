Day before yesterday, or Tuesday, or some
liino, there was a liaslv nasty song slllll4 by
California students at Berkeley. We under
stand that it began villi something like "The
Cardinals lie Confounded."
Nov, understand, vo won the Big Came,
and we're not griping. But, Mr. Sproul, we
really I'an't stand for such shameful language.
We would expect it in the well, rest room at
Cantield's, but we simply just can't tolerate
such songs right out in front of Wilbur and
everybody.
There are 110 gentlemen at California. We
understand they are nothing but mugs. Tsk,
Isk. And we will have you know, Mr. Sproul,
that if you want to sing your feolthv old song,
we want it sung in your office, or at the foot
of the Campanile, where dogs have been seen
recently. Keep il clean, please.
(I\S. Our parents were nice people, fur
thermore, and we don't like being friendly
with bears.)
