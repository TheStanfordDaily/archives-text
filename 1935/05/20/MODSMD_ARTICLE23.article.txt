# SPEWING THE NEWS
## WITH WHISPERING DICK LOPEAR 
### CEDRIC'S BANGS 
"By the bones of good old great-grand-pappy
Brown, there's going to be another war, " ejaculated
D.T. ("D" for Dick, or Dickie) Lopear, who for years
has baffled hundreds of students with his completely
inaudible whisperings from the lecture platform. "And,
Jee.se. what a siss-cutter of a war it s goin-j to be," the
diminutive whispering further vociferously spouted. I
Dick was viewing the news—news of Italian
mobilization, German rearmament. Japanese sub
marine launchings, and Harlem race riots. And it
stirred him. stirred him to the depths, because Dick
is i fighter of the old school—of the Lopear fight
ing old school, where somebody's always fighting,
or talking about it.
"There's going to be another war," he repeated,
"with more flag waving, more cheering, marching,
drafting, singing, liberty bonds, munitions profits, and
hlood, mud, muck, and delicious horror. How proud
will be the D.A.R., the S.A.R., the American Legion,
and the bonus marchers! Glorious!"
Dick was in the last war. He's got the cold dopr.
He's a veteran devil-dog of the air who crowned his
lighting career by taking a broken airplane pro- !
peller and "cutting a 30-foot .swath through a solid j

wall of German steel and flesh, DRAGGING A LIB
ERTY MOTOR BEHIND HlM.''
Whispering Dick stopped viewing the news and
lifted his grizzled continance to view a blank spot
on the wall. "Yes," he hissed, "the sword of Mars
hangs ominously over peace loving America. The
sword will fall, and when it rises, it will drip red with
(he blood of the flowering youth of the world—youth
that never . . . really . . . wanted . . . to . . . fight
. . . each . . . other. (He whispered the words
slowly, and then he grew pensive.)
"War is wrong. It's abnormal and unnecessary. In
these modern times, nobody can gain by fighting. False
ideas of nationalism and patriotism, and absurd ideol
ogies drive nations into conflict. The world is indeed
ill when its peoples, all brothers under the skin, take
up arms to slaughter each other.
"I was over there in 1918 when thousands were
crucified on the cross of military persecution. The
skeleton hand of death plucked awav the very flower
of the world, driven to bloody graves by the flag
waving and air of patriotism at home. Those men
went into Hell to fight for a cause that they knew* or
cared little about, simply because they would have
been branded as cowards if they hadn't. Do you think
those American dough-boys were fighting for love of
their country or revenge for a few ships sunk by the
Huns? No. Those boys were driven on from behind
by wives, sweethearts, and friends who thought it was
just too, too divine that John should go out and fight
for peacg and the love of his country.
"That's what makes war, and that's what will
bring on the next war. Headlines will scream, bugles
will blow, the sound of troops marching through the
streets to the tune of the 'Star Spangled Banner' will
cause mothers to cry and turn to their sons and say:
'Oh. don't they look grand and brave marching forth
to defend their country!'
"But will I keep my head and not go forth to
slaughter just for fear of what my friends might say?
Hell, no. I won't have the guts to stay home anymore
than anybody else will."
