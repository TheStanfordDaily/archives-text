A"N INTERVIEW BY CHOLLY DRAMATICS
"Oh, said Dickie Boy, running out of his office in
the Old Union and dashing for the nearest cuspidor,
"my thicket thale ith therible."
"Why, Mr. Frank, quoth your interviewer, 'you
told the press that this Friday's play is onn of the best
you have ever managed."
Dickie Boy wiped his perspiring brow with a lacy
handkerchief and murmured: "Yeth, but the Daily—
that horrible newthpaper. With its 15 tenth and
everything, the nasty old reporters won't printh pic
thures of my lovely cath. Sometimes I become so
exathperated I could thimply die."
Just then the telephone rang and "Richie" hooked
his left biscuspid into place and exerting all his
strength, got the receiver off the hook.
"Oh, Miss Stevens, you simply thlay me. Why, we
can't allow that brazen woman to atthend our per
formanth. Why, I am bringing one of my best friends
to play tonight, and that vulgar woman would ruin
his perspective."
"Who," interrogated your reporter, "is this terrible
woman?"
Dicky Boy shuddered throughout his huge, brittle
frame, and the sight of it was enough to make strong
men pale. He averted his lace and speaking through
drawn lips and clenched teeth managed to articulate,
"MARgery Bailey."
"Aha," droned your alert reviewer, "clamping
his vice-like grip on Frank's fragile wrist, "the dirt,
Dickie Boy—the dirt."
Frank straightened up, heaved a dramatic (man
ager's) sigh, and cast discretion to the winds. "She
poisoned my mind against 'A Midsummer Night's
Dream' when I was a freshman in her Shakespeare
course. She Shatterthed my youthful illusions, and
lefth me—only a broken down remnant of an esthetic
soul." »
Dickie Boy drooled his impotent rage all over his
blotter pad, as your inquiring reporter stood up to
leave.
"Oh Cholly, help me, help me, the cast is going to
kill me tonight after the performance if I don't take
in enough money to pay them not to reveal my terrible
secret." Standing on one leg, Dickie Boy lost his
balance, fell, and crumpled like a sheet of Kleenex
(advertisement) into the nearest wastebasket.
Your emasculated interviewer fished Frank out and
revived him by tossing the Dramatic Manager's bottle
of red ink down his throat. Frank woke up at once,
completely revived. Spraying red ink from his nose
and throat, Dickie Boy was a menacing sight to see
as the dried talcum powder fell off his face and his
curly hair permanently lost its temporary wave.
"Goth-Dammith," he shrieked, "where ith that
Bcnneth Cave, the underthlung Phi Delthy who ap
pointhed me to this gruth job?"
Once again Dickie Boy fell into a mighty swoon,
this time almost knocking over three quill pens as his
tremendous weight fell against them. Just then the
cast and director of the play came in and finding Frank
in a dead-away faint, quartered him and salted away
the remains, hoping thus to cure him off his ills.
Cholly, your sensitive interviewer, flitted away.

"Oh, said Dickie Boy, running out of his office in
the Old Union and dashing for the nearest cuspidor,
"my thicket thale ith therible."
"Why, Mr. Frank, quoth your interviewer, 'you
told the press that this Friday's play is onn of the best
you have ever managed."
Dickie Boy wiped his perspiring brow with a lacy
handkerchief and murmured: "Yeth, but the Daily—
that horrible newthpaper. With its 15 tenth and
everything, the nasty old reporters won't printh pic
thures of my lovely cath. Sometimes I become so
exathperated I could thimply die."
Just then the telephone rang and "Richie" hooked
his left biscuspid into place and exerting all his
strength, got the receiver off the hook.
"Oh, Miss Stevens, you simply thlay me. Why, we
can't allow that brazen woman to atthend our per
formanth. Why, I am bringing one of my best friends
to play tonight, and that vulgar woman would ruin
his perspective."
"Who," interrogated your reporter, "is this terrible
woman?"
Dicky Boy shuddered throughout his huge, brittle
frame, and the sight of it was enough to make strong
men pale. He averted his lace and speaking through
drawn lips and clenched teeth managed to articulate,
"MARgery Bailey."
"Aha," droned your alert reviewer, "clamping
his vice-like grip on Frank's fragile wrist, "the dirt,
Dickie Boy—the dirt."
Frank straightened up, heaved a dramatic (man
ager's) sigh, and cast discretion to the winds. "She
poisoned my mind against 'A Midsummer Night's
Dream' when I was a freshman in her Shakespeare
course. She Shatterthed my youthful illusions, and
lefth me—only a broken down remnant of an esthetic
soul." »
Dickie Boy drooled his impotent rage all over his
blotter pad, as your inquiring reporter stood up to
leave.
"Oh Cholly, help me, help me, the cast is going to
kill me tonight after the performance if I don't take
in enough money to pay them not to reveal my terrible
secret." Standing on one leg, Dickie Boy lost his
balance, fell, and crumpled like a sheet of Kleenex
(advertisement) into the nearest wastebasket.
Your emasculated interviewer fished Frank out and
revived him by tossing the Dramatic Manager's bottle
of red ink down his throat. Frank woke up at once,
completely revived. Spraying red ink from his nose
and throat, Dickie Boy was a menacing sight to see
as the dried talcum powder fell off his face and his
curly hair permanently lost its temporary wave.
"Goth-Dammith," he shrieked, "where ith that
Bcnneth Cave, the underthlung Phi Delthy who ap
pointhed me to this gruth job?"
Once again Dickie Boy fell into a mighty swoon,
this time almost knocking over three quill pens as his
tremendous weight fell against them. Just then the
cast and director of the play came in and finding Frank
in a dead-away faint, quartered him and salted away
the remains, hoping thus to cure him off his ills.
Cholly, your sensitive interviewer, flitted away.
