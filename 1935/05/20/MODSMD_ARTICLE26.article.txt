# 'CO-OP ROBS US' WAIL OF GYPED HOUSE MANAGER
## 
### 
■ Shouting cries of "We been rob
j bed,'' and "Tar and feather 'em,"
some score of irate house-managers
last night stormed ths headquar
ters of the Stanford Co-operative
Buying Association in Branner
basement, searching for Manager
Byres and President Mallet-trap.
The angry mob, hollering "we
! been gypped long Enough" and wav
ing co-op bills on which exhorbitant
prices for notoriously cheap foods
appeared, were unable to find their
I eought-for victims, and finally seat
! tered, vowing to drag them before
i the next house managers' meeting
for what promises to be the biggest
graft expose in years.
Spray Ringleader
Singled out from the yowling crew
las*l night, ring-leader Jesse Spray,
! pudgy bill-collector of the Whappa
Stigma house, explained the situa
i tion: •»
j "Last year some dope went around
| and talked practically every house
j and eating club on the campus to
j sign a five-year contract with the
| Co-op. And the University sanc
| tionod it, but did they join up with
j their Unions and dormitory eating
| outfits? No. We were the only
j suckers. And now we're paying and
j paying, and for what. Some of the
gruttiest food that ever got tossed in
| a garbage can.
Asks Question
"You'd think a place like a fra
ternity that serves 90 individual
meals a day could buy food cheaper
than retail, wouldn't you? But the
Co-op not only changes more than
any whoiesale house, but more than
j any retail store."
He waxed wrathful as he. ram
! hied on.
! "And another thing. The Co-op
j made us all pay them $300, just to be
sure we pay our bills. We're stuck,
I tell you, and we're going to take it
out on somebody."
Hasty investigation plainly showed
that more money is going into the
Co-op than is the same worth in
j food coming out. And with the
! financial end of the outfit practically
! in the hands of one person, things
look awful suspicious.
Showdown Promised
In the show-down which the
house-managers promise to have,
such matters as "Why does the Co
op, a non-profit making outfit, charge
more than retail stores, which are
profit making"; "Where does the
money go"; "What happened to
those 300 buckses"; and "Where do
they get those sickly ip.mb-chops"
will be brought up.
Inquiries as to the whereabouts of
Byers and Mall-at-trap last night
were fruitless.
