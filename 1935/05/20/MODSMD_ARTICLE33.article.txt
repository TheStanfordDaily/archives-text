### 
The Editor, Sir:
In answer to thp Campus Opinion
j and your editorial in Thursday's
i Daily, it my purpose to inform the
j campus* that Lagunita Court itself
had no connection with the recent
campaign and advertisement for the
| duck who resides at said residence.
Furthermore, Mr. Editor, not all
members of the new regime at Stan
j ford have forgotten tradition and
dignity, and we do not want a duck
for the queen of the Masque Ball.
The girls of Lagunita Court, Mr.
\ Editor, are nice girls,
1 Furthermore, Mr. Editor, most of
the girls of Lagunita Court, Mr. Edi
tor, will have nothing to do with a
duck.
! The girls of Lagunita Court, Mr.
Editor, are nice girls.
j Why don't you try us some time,
Sue Clarke,
President, Lagunita Court
