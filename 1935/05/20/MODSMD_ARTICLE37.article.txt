# WOLTER AND BUNK WEEP INTO THEIR STALE BOCK BEER
## Pasters Quashes Basketball, Baseball Pastimes 
### 
Baseball and basketball are no
longer major sports at Stanford. This
was unanimously decided by the
Board of Athletic Control, in all day
session at the La Honda tea rooms
yesterday. Ihe decision hardly was
a surprise, since it came as mere
official confirmation of a long-es
tabli.shed fact.
Sports Near Doom
In reducing the two activities to
minor sports, according to General
Manager Alf Pasters, the Board
turned flown a motion, by a 5 to 4
vote, to bounce basketball and base
hall entirely from the campus ath
letic program.
Expected similar action regarding
track was tabled, pending the out
come of the four Indian entries in
the national meets. Pasters called
another meeting of the Board for
early in June to decide on this mat
ter "before completing the 1935-3G
budget."
"The basketball - baseball move
will help pay oft the University
debt," Pasters 'enthusiastically
chortled, "since Circle "S" sweaters
are cheaper and less durable than
the blocks."
Ex Committee To Approve
Ex Committee will have to ap
prove the measure before its goes
into effect, but little trouble was ex
pected here, since President Morphie
Kann already gave his approval in
the board meeting.
Sweaters already awarded to this
year's basketball and baseball teams
will be called in, it was pointed out,
and that particular group "won't
even get circles, unless it's under
their eyes," Pasters vociferously de
clared. He mumbled something to
the effect, "They were a bad invest
ment."
