## TAKE HEED, B.A.C.— WHAT THIS SCHOOL NEEDS: 
### 
The Daily makus a few brief re
quests of the B.A.C. or whoever it
is around here that has the sayso:
(a) Rebuild Angell Field. Some
one said that's where Cap'n A1 went
sour. Well, it could have been there,
p (b) More scholarships. It's a long
nme since Stanford beat S.C. in
track. In place of scholarships we
could use a few Hollywood studios
for employment purposes.
(c) Rebuild Angell Field. Captain
Gus Meier broke an arm there.
(d) Install a bar in the press
box. Hell, between halves or dur
ing the two-mile, the scribes
don't need a cup of coffee or a
glass of orange juice.
(e) Rebuild Angell Field. Truck
Dellinger doesn't like it.

STADIUM SHOULD
HAVE AN ESCALATOR

. (f) Furnish an escalator for the
Stanford Stadium. It would be a
helluva good investment, 8.A.C.;
just look at all the crippled women
and tired business men who might
come to football games—even track
meets, although that's expecting a
lot.
(g) Rebuild Angell Field. Thef
got ants in their bleachers.
(h) Shorten the holes and lessen
the profits of the Stanford golf
course. It's an awful graft, that
dollar-a-throw.
(i) Rebuild Angell Field. Why?
Because the Daily's been cam
paigning for it.
(j) Tone down the El Toro flat
feet that haunt the Stadium, Sunken
Diamond, tennis courts, and dances.
After all, they don't own the school
—yet.
(k) Rebuild Angell Field. Chuck
Minno punched it all full of holes
with his peg leg.
(I) Throw a roof onto the Sta
dium. The track team could get
an earlier start next year; also,
next fall's football squad will
probably be a dry-wentber outfit,
(m) Rebuild Withit Field. Marvie
Kahn was injured in the last game
on the old field.
(n) Let's have a local race track—
lor combined dog, horse, and motor
cycle races.
(o) Rebuild Angell Field.

dium. The track team could get
an earlier start next year; also,
next fall's football squad will
probably be a dry-wentber outfit,
(m) Rebuild Withit Field. Marvie
Kahn was injured in the last game
on the old field.
(n) Let's have a local race track—
lor combined dog, horse, and motor
cycle races.
(o) Rebuild Angell Field.

The Daily makus a few brief re
quests of the B.A.C. or whoever it
is around here that has the sayso:
(a) Rebuild Angell Field. Some
one said that's where Cap'n A1 went
sour. Well, it could have been there,
p (b) More scholarships. It's a long
nme since Stanford beat S.C. in
track. In place of scholarships we
could use a few Hollywood studios
for employment purposes.
(c) Rebuild Angell Field. Captain
Gus Meier broke an arm there.
(d) Install a bar in the press
box. Hell, between halves or dur
ing the two-mile, the scribes
don't need a cup of coffee or a
glass of orange juice.
(e) Rebuild Angell Field. Truck
Dellinger doesn't like it.

STADIUM SHOULD
HAVE AN ESCALATOR

. (f) Furnish an escalator for the
Stanford Stadium. It would be a
helluva good investment, 8.A.C.;
just look at all the crippled women
and tired business men who might
come to football games—even track
meets, although that's expecting a
lot.
(g) Rebuild Angell Field. Thef
got ants in their bleachers.
(h) Shorten the holes and lessen
the profits of the Stanford golf
course. It's an awful graft, that
dollar-a-throw.
(i) Rebuild Angell Field. Why?
Because the Daily's been cam
paigning for it.
(j) Tone down the El Toro flat
feet that haunt the Stadium, Sunken
Diamond, tennis courts, and dances.
After all, they don't own the school
—yet.
(k) Rebuild Angell Field. Chuck
Minno punched it all full of holes
with his peg leg.
(I) Throw a roof onto the Sta
dium. The track team could get
an earlier start next year; also,
next fall's football squad will
probably be a dry-wentber outfit,
(m) Rebuild Withit Field. Marvie
Kahn was injured in the last game
on the old field.
(n) Let's have a local race track—
lor combined dog, horse, and motor
cycle races.
(o) Rebuild Angell Field.
