# INSPIRED TRACKMEN LOSE, GIVEN GRAVY JAUNT EAST,

While the blood-red sun dipped
silently out of sight behind the pur
ple hills that cradle the hayfield that
is Stanford, tears welled into the
eyes of 453 emotion-laden specta
tors.
A great Stanford track team
Kid gone down to defeat, fighting
gamely and gloriously to the last.
Defeat, did we say? Yes, but de
feat such as transcends mundane
matters like amassing points and
gathering the fleeting laurels of
victory.
"Yeah, damn it, it was that bad," !
rasped Dink Simpleton, as he picked j
up the pieces of his beloved track j
and field team, which had once an !
1.C.4-A. title, an N.C.A.A. title, and
a few such baubles as that, or maybe !
we were only dreaming?
Oh, we forgot to mention that that j
old meanie El Trojan had just run, I
and jumped and messed around in !
general all over the prostrate form
of the old Stanford Indian, Chief j
Flat-on-his-fanny, to the tune of :
973 to 7 or some such thing. Naw, '

Jwc couldn't have gotten 7. Oh, what
the hell difference does it make?
Pleased beyond recognition by the
showing of "his boys" over the
week-end, Templeton announced the
; four men who are sure to go to the
Boston Tea Party next week-end:
1. Hunt Kingfish — his come-
I through appearance in the relay es
j tablishes him as no less than a
j threat in the 400 meeters; he'll prob
ably run the two-mile, too, just be
cause Stanford hasn't anyone el.se
! who could place here.
| 2. Lloyd "May Come Through
| Again" Squeem—he came through
j once, remember. And he'd of done it
again Saturday, he said, but he came
I through with the measles first. Fig
i ured for five points (or feet) in the
! high jump (or ball).
3. Arte Angerson — he'll hurdle
| and pole vault, he being as consist
i ent in one as the other. Angerson
I plans to condense the two races and
i use a pole in the hurdle race and
! vice versa, he remarked yesterday.
' "It will simplify the hurdle clear
' ance," he added. j

and field team, which had once an !
1.C.4-A. title, an N.C.A.A. title, and
a few such baubles as that, or maybe !
we were only dreaming?
Oh, we forgot to mention that that j
old meanie El Trojan had just run, I
and jumped and messed around in !
general all over the prostrate form
of the old Stanford Indian, Chief j
Flat-on-his-fanny, to the tune of :
973 to 7 or some such thing. Naw, '

Jwc couldn't have gotten 7. Oh, what
the hell difference does it make?
Pleased beyond recognition by the
showing of "his boys" over the
week-end, Templeton announced the
; four men who are sure to go to the
Boston Tea Party next week-end:
1. Hunt Kingfish — his come-
I through appearance in the relay es
j tablishes him as no less than a
j threat in the 400 meeters; he'll prob
ably run the two-mile, too, just be
cause Stanford hasn't anyone el.se
! who could place here.
| 2. Lloyd "May Come Through
| Again" Squeem—he came through
j once, remember. And he'd of done it
again Saturday, he said, but he came
I through with the measles first. Fig
i ured for five points (or feet) in the
! high jump (or ball).
3. Arte Angerson — he'll hurdle
| and pole vault, he being as consist
i ent in one as the other. Angerson
I plans to condense the two races and
i use a pole in the hurdle race and
! vice versa, he remarked yesterday.
' "It will simplify the hurdle clear
' ance," he added. j
While the blood-red sun dipped
silently out of sight behind the pur
ple hills that cradle the hayfield that
is Stanford, tears welled into the
eyes of 453 emotion-laden specta
tors.
A great Stanford track team
Kid gone down to defeat, fighting
gamely and gloriously to the last.
Defeat, did we say? Yes, but de
feat such as transcends mundane
matters like amassing points and
gathering the fleeting laurels of
victory.
"Yeah, damn it, it was that bad," !
