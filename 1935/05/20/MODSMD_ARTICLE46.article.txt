# INFORMATION CLERK JOINS JOYOUS AGNEW

### 
. AGNEW, May 19 (OOP),—A new
comer to the happy colony here last
night was Miss Susie Snizzletop, said
to have once been information clerk
in the administration building at
Stanford University. The Snizzletop
specimen was found wandejing
about the lower reaches of Palo Alto,
clad thinly in an hallucination.
She muttered, sneered, griped, re
lated a strange story of having been
driven to this by the antics of sev
eral enraged students, who, she as
serts, changed the sign over her win
dow, which formerly read "Informa
tion." Source of the substituted sign
was revealed as a spot at the Palo
Alto airport, where new experiments
have been carried on with — well,
sewer gas.

Statistics show that the rough is ,
poorer because ol the new women's
champagne tastes. Nothing left in j
his beer pocketbook but woims. Back I
to Washington!
