# Union Grub Cruddy, Rumor
## 'It Stinks of Graft' Claims Hashing Mob Soup Siphoned from Murky Lagunita Depths 
### 
"It ain't the cupidity or even the
stupidityâ€”it's the overhead that puts
the Union in a hole, raises prices to
the skies, and takes just one damn
dollar after another," warbled
Christine and Almon from the Cel
lar's spacious 525,000 lounging room
for flat-footed hashers yesterday
while a horrified Dally reporter
stood by and watched sucker after
sucker walk the plank into a sea
of red ink.
Old Captain Kidder Froth re
moved the dagger from his mouth,
lifted the patch from his eye, winked
knowingly, and then cackled glee
fully, "Overhead, overpaid we will
fleece the trusting frails while the
dollars go rolling to hell."
No Telling
Dunking a moldy doughnut into a
cup of brownish-colored dishwater,
Miss Snicker burbled, "But it's like
I always said, we have to pay such
scandalous wages to our dear boys,
there's no telling what the end will
be."
"Why, would you believe it, wc
Jv>ve to pay hoys a full 15-
ccnl meal for a mere hour's work.
It's outrageous. And the prices we
have to pay for what we laugh
ingly call food!
Why the price of greasy, gan
grened grut, putrified potatoes, pre
glacial bread, and seaweed salad has
advanced sky-high. We do save a
little something on soup since La
gunita has stayed full so long. But
ihen the cost of dredging the lake
bottom every day is something ter
rific:."
Oirls Overcharged
"Of course we make a little by
charging the girls who cat here
Iwice as much as the crud is worth
:>nd making them wait on them
elves, but. that doesn't help much."
With tears streaming down his
(hecks because of the Union's sad
plight, the Daily reporter went
around to interview Will I-sneer,
< ne of the Union's more prominent
tnen-about-town. My-sner attained
! ical fame at the Union by essaying
(lie role of Spartacus to the hashers,
William Tell to the embattled soup
lingers, or the Patrick Henry of the
dish destroyers, or something. Well,
to get on with the story, but why
should we?
Grutty Garbage
Anyway, Eisner (now the cat's
out of the bag, hell) got the whip
wielders to change the diet of the
hashers from the garbage they had
I oen getting to the garbage the girls
v ere getting, in the fond hope that
it would be better garbage. After
tugging on carrot salads for several
reeks, the boys cried for relief and
vent back to the old deal.
"Jeez," chortled Eisner, "it was
a good idea, anyway." Now Eis
ner doesn't come around to the
Union much. lie has a sub work
ing for him. Once in a while he
comes around to sub for the sub.
But not often.
Eisner is not the first great son
of Stanford to be connected with the
Union. Herbert C. Hoover, '95,
thought the whole damn thing up
in the first place. Yeah, but give a
guy a chanct, give a guy a chanct.
Ain't it enough to blame the depres
sion on one man without that, too?
