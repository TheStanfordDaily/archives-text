soul-rending appeal from a roped-off area on the greensward and Triolo
closing the affair with a few yells for himself.

told the multitude: "I am a Row |
man, I am a Row man. I am a Phi <
Psi, I am a Phi Psi. I know Mottram,
Mottram is my pal. Mottram has his
stooges. I am his stooges.
A patter of applause trickled over
the stadium. Triolo jumped to his
feet, screamed, "That's what I like
to see, plenty of support, come on,
yell!" Brooke bowed, resumed his
speech.
"I never say yes, I never say no,
they ask me what's doin', I say yes
and no. I never voted on Ex Com
mittee so I have no enemies. That is
to be truthful, but this is strictly
confidential, I never voted except
when Mottram voted.
Triolo tripped to the microphone
and in a low voice whispered:

"Rootity toot, rootity toot, wc all

"You like mc, I like you, let's get

Give him gravy and he'll say ma, ma,

Brooke's a stooge, tried and true.
He can get votes, but so can you.
Rah rah, rah rah, rah rah, rah.
"As a parting word, I'd like to
leave this parting word with you.
