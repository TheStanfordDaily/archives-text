# Indian Score Upped As Jim Heaves Record Bird
## 
### 
Late last night intercollegiate
track officials announced that three
extra points would be added to
Stanford's score on the official
books, since they had just learned
that Jim Reynolds, husky weight
tossci\ had set a new coast record
by putting the bird 23 feet 2Vi inches.
The incident, which was over
looked in the heat of Saturday's ex
citement, happened when big Jim
dropped a 12-pound shot on his toe
and involuntarily put the bird with
a mighty heave. Reynolds' mark
breaks the old record set by Califor
nia's Joe Puuk, a sophomore man
ager who set his mark in 1921 after
a bee had flown down his throat.
