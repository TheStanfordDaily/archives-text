# Bowbie Sold To Red-Baiter

### 
Stanley Ex-Editor Bowbare, fair- j
i haired non-pink of these Steenfurd j
| campoose, was finally perswaded i
much against his will to work for a j
munificent stipend under that cq- i
Jossal peer of American publishers, |
j that upholder of the best in the land ,
'of the free-to-be-reamed, Mr.
| Wearst.
Surprised was Stanley that the 1
Freesco Xaminer published his
; splendiferous editorial on why there
| should be peace but no one should
| fight for it, why maroons are fine
I people but they shouldn't be red.
j Meester Bowbairy had no iota of an j
j idea that the nassy ole publisher
would want his wonderful explana- j
• tions.
With Wearstlings to the right of
| him and Wearstlings to the laft of 1
| him, into the valley of Sun Samion !
; strode the dauntless Stanlie. None j
; of the high convictions ingrained in
his soul were in the slightest modi
fied by contacting the super-paper
entrepreneur.
"It was me own idear," said the j
| smooth ex-Daily editor. "I know j
there ain't no Commonism here, but
j does the woil know it, does Wearst
: know it? I will clear up this orful
! mizunderstanding. And of course I 1
| will not accept a job—unless it's of-
I fered to me!"
Any of the intrepid Dyily editor's
admirers can address fan mail to
| the wastebasket, care ol the San
Frunsico Zaminer.
