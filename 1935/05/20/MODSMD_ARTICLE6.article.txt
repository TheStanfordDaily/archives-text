Thus did Senior Class Treasurer
Iron Man Mill Friedman dispel till

Senior Ball except the dancers and
part of an orchestra.
"We'll save money!" he shrieked.
I "Chaperones, too."
Dance committeemen rushed up.
to protest against the possibility of
no decorations, no lighting, no sou
venirs for the boys. "Decorations?"
asked Friedman. "We'd turn the
lights out anyway. Paste pass-out

"This guy Bcaubaire is only the
chairman," he revealed. "He's my
stooge. I'm the guy that signs the
checks. Why, he can't even order
programs and souvenirs unless I get
mine first."

While Guy Lombardo, Henry
