# THEATER REAM TICKLES ROTH, HURTS ROUGHS
## Comptroller's Chain Letter Scheme Pulls for New Bird Bath Edifice 
### 
Stanford postal authorities today
announced that they had uncovered
a new chain-letter scheme, but
frankly admitted they know of no
way to stop it. The latest wrinkle
in money-makers was started by
that clever little rascal, Almon E.
Roth, and is called "Let's-All-Get-
Behind - the-New-Stanford-School
of - the-Theater-and-Just-Add-the-
Dollar - to-Your-Check-Made-Pay
able-to-Stanford-University" chain
letter.
"It's a sure-fire business proposi
tion," said Almon, shaking hands
! with a reporter last night as he sang
| "My Rosary Forever."

"All the students have to do is
! borrow $325,000 from the University
to build the New Stanford School of
I the Theater, replete and complete
! with rehearsal rooms, class rooms,
j drill rooms, work rooms, rest rooms,
! offices, and the memorial ornamental
1 bird bath. Then, if the students are
very, very good, the University will
i let them turn the theater over to the
University—when it is done.
"In return for all these service,
, the University will not charge the
; A.S.S.U. a single penny rent (not a
! single lc) for putting on their shows.
Think of it! Not a .single one cent!
Students Reamed
"Now where the money-making
j scheme comes in Ls this: The A.S.S.U.
1 borrows the money from the Univer
sity (and pays it back over a period
;of 19 years) at the rate of 10 per
cent. Isn't that a nifty! You can't
; lose. EVERYBODY WINS. That is,
everyone but the students."

Meanwhile, the University archi

Architect Erpyer Brown told a re
j porter last night that the plans called

| Stanford ingenuity, perseverance,
' naivete, and business acumen.
Architect Erpyer Brown told a re
j porter last night that the plans called

! appropriate, we think," he said.
Stanford postal authorities today
announced that they had uncovered
a new chain-letter scheme, but
frankly admitted they know of no
way to stop it. The latest wrinkle
in money-makers was started by
that clever little rascal, Almon E.
Roth, and is called "Let's-All-Get-
Behind - the-New-Stanford-School
of - the-Theater-and-Just-Add-the-
Dollar - to-Your-Check-Made-Pay
able-to-Stanford-University" chain
letter.
"It's a sure-fire business proposi
tion," said Almon, shaking hands
! with a reporter last night as he sang
| "My Rosary Forever."
Stellar Shakedown
"All the students have to do is
! borrow $325,000 from the University
to build the New Stanford School of
I the Theater, replete and complete
! with rehearsal rooms, class rooms,
j drill rooms, work rooms, rest rooms,
! offices, and the memorial ornamental
1 bird bath. Then, if the students are
very, very good, the University will
i let them turn the theater over to the
University—when it is done.
"In return for all these service,
, the University will not charge the
; A.S.S.U. a single penny rent (not a
! single lc) for putting on their shows.
Think of it! Not a .single one cent!
Students Reamed
"Now where the money-making
j scheme comes in Ls this: The A.S.S.U.
1 borrows the money from the Univer
sity (and pays it back over a period
;of 19 years) at the rate of 10 per
cent. Isn't that a nifty! You can't
; lose. EVERYBODY WINS. That is,
everyone but the students."
