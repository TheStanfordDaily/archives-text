# 23,000 Gyped by 8.A.C.; Dough-Heavy B.A.C. Glad
## 
### 
It was reported last night that the
| B.A.C. had sold 23,000 too many
| tickets for next year's Big Game.
At $3 apiece this amounts to $69,000.
Of course there will be no seats
for these extra 23,000 people, but
that will be all right. "Just think of
the 8.A.C.," said Don Licbendorfer
and Alfred Masters last night,
i Split five ways (Masters, Lieben-
I dorfcr, Jake Irwin, Miss Eunice Du
Prau, and Bobby Grayson), each
will net $13,800. Licbendorfer last
night said that if this same stunt
could bo pulled successfully for the
next three years; all five would
; "probably retire." Especially if
Stanford gets another Rose Bowl
bid. Since the graft in Pasadena is
marvelous." The other four were
| "deeply gratified" at the news, when
approached last, night.
