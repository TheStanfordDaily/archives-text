# CONGRESS MAY CONSIDER NEW VETERAN BILLS
## Democratic Floor Leader Favors Compromised Bonus Measures PATMANITES HOPEFUL Veto Confirmation Believed Certain in Senate 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 20 (A 3 ). —
Senator Robinson, the Democratic
leader, said today he would like to
sec some bonus legislation "worked
out and passed" after the Patman
bill has been killed.
The statement was the first inti
mation Administration leaders would
consider new veterans' legislation in
case the Patman bill was rejected.
Heretofore, they have discouraged
all such suggestions. "If it were pos
sible," Robinson said, "I would like to
see some further legislation worked
out and passed, but I don't know
whether it is possible or not."
He gave no indication. of what
kind of legislation might be consid
ered.
Vetoes Bill Tomorrow
Earlier President Roosevelt had
listened to a Patman pJea that he
approve payment of the bonus with
new money. The plea failed to
shake his intention to deliver his
veto message, in person, Wednesday.
Meanwhile, as it appeared more
certain the veto would be upheld,
an Administration chief in Congress
predicted 72 Senate votes — more
than enough to over-ride a veto—
could be mustered for a less re
stricting bill.
Amendment Considered
Plans were shaped to attach a
rider to some pending measure, an
amendment that would tell the
President to pay the bonus, but to
select whatever method he desired.
Leaders were assuming, despite
optimistic statements from some
Patman-ites, the veto would be de
livered and sustained in the Senate
after a House vote to over-ride.
Roosevelt supporters in the Senate
asserted a late check showed there
would be four or five votes to spare.
Clark To Offer Rider
Yet staunchest Administration
leaders were willing to concede the
fight would not be settled even then.
Senator Clark of Missouri has a new
bonus payment measure in mind,
and may offer it as a rider on the
pending navy appropriation bill if
that is still before the Senate after
the Patman veto is sustained.
The Administration chief who re
putedly found the 72 votes was one
who thought, it would be smart po
litically for the bonus to be paid this
year and not hold off until 1936.
