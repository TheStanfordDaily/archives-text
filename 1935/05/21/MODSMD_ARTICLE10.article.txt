# Fears Felt For Detective Burns' Bandaged Head
## 
### 
• No, local gangdom haSn't de
clared war on Campus Cop
George Burns; he wasn't slug
ged by some irate traffic law of
fender; and he hasn't, as yet,
been out for football scrimmage
or wrestling workouts.
No, none of such dire calami
ties has befallen him. But if
they had, even all at once, he
couldn't possibly gain a more
hospitalized appearance than
he has now achieved. At a cas
ual glance it seems to be his
entire head. That member is
swathed in what must be the
mile and a half limit in bandage
length.
But, through enlisting the aid
of Officer Gordy Davis, it was
conclusively proved that his
head was entirely well. As
a matter of fact, sleuths cen
tered the trouble down to a
carbuncle, which now gently
reposes on Bums' neck. Just
one carbuncle, but it's caused
no end of bother to its victim.
At present, Burns is taking a
well-deserved vacation from
his duties. But he'll soon be
back on the job. They didn't
"get" him.
