# BOARD DELAYS DEFINITE MOVE ON NEW FIELD
## Measure May Pass, Says Masters, if Expense Can Be Reduced 
### 
Stanford's proposed new Angell
| Field still loomed a distant hope as
Graduate Manager Alfred Masters
reported last night that the B.A.C.
had taken no action on the matter at
| its meeting Sunday evening.
Masters brought the matter before
I the Board of Athletic Control in the
j form of an estimate of the needed
I work, but at the same time re-
I quested that no sentiment, either for
| or against the measure, be expressed
i until the next session, June 17.
Cost Estimated
It. was revealed that the present
estimate by Sam McDonald, super
intendent of athletic buildings and
grounds, runs approximately $23,000;
1 Masters feels that the measure wouid
j stand a better chance of receiving
j approval if the figure were cut to
j $17,000, the amount paid for the
Stanford Stadium cinderpath.
Wednesday evening the estimate
i will be carried before the Finance
j Committee, as will the entire budget
; for 1935-36 athletic seasons, for cur
j tailment. Then if such action is
I successfully completed plans will be
i made to borrow the funds for the
j new field and the entire scheme will
! receive final judgment by the board
i at their June meeting. Masters feels
confident it will be passed.
Field To Be Modern
McDonald's figure of $23,000 is
based upon the construction of the
most modern of track and field units,
i It includes cutting the present track
j a foot lower, filling the field to near
jly the same level, turfing and
! equipping the field with an auto
| matic sprinkler system.
Masters expressed the belief that
I if the Finance Committee could see
no other way to cut down the cost
of the project, it might forget the
rebuilding of the field temporarily,
leaving the projected track work
j intact.
In that case he felt sure that the
'measure would receive the B.A.C.
I okay and work would go under way
I during the summer months.
