# Women Nose Out Roughs In Current Measles Race
## 
### ROBERT EISENBACH 
You can't beat out the gals. Take i
measles, for instance: Two weeks
ago, the Stanford rough had hos
pital sickbeds all to himself. Today
the girls are rapidly laking the lead,
says Dr. T. A. Storey, director of
Men's Health Service.
Bi-Weekly Cycles
What's the reason? The doctor
doesn't know for sure, although he
has some private ideas. He does
know that campus dances, crowded
places generally, are responsible for
the recurrence of the epidemic that
has so far raised ned with over 100
scholastic and social programs. The
disease runs in bi-weekly cycles. It
started in April and reached its first
peak two weeks ago with 72 cases,
then suddenly tobagganed off the
medical department graph with
only four or five student.-; "in."
Last week old man illness took a
new lease on life. He added 30 new
victims, who filled the Palo Alto
Hospital wards and overflowed into
(he isolation annex.
Right now the epidemic is at its 1

'height, says Dr. Storey, with 114
students on their backs and the ex
| pected "wane" just around the cor
ner. Incidentally, getting the mea
; sles at Stanford isn't, so bad. "Pa
tients get the best of care and they
have fun, too. All we ask is that
; anyone who isn't feeling right re
port to the medical department for
an examination to prevent further
spread," ihc doctor declared.
No Scarlet Fever
As to scarlet fever, consistently
rumored around the campus, Dr.
Storey says absolutely "no." "The
klea is baseless," he said. "There is
only one case on the 1035 medical
office files. That was dismissed two
weeks ago."
And while administrative heads
sigh with relief, many a rough who
would have sold out today for a "C"
average, faces an enforced regimen
of midnight-oil-burning and exam
inations, for school will not close
until finals are over as per schedule.
I Too bud, folks.
