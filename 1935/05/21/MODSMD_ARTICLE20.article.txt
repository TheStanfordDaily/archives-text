Jones, Orr Compete
Bob Jones and Frank Orr are the
two candidates who will be voted
upon. Under the new system of elec
tions, as inaugurated in last Febru
ary's race, the staff elects its new
editor directly, with the night edi
tors and editorial board, however,
being allowed a greater percentage
of votes than lower-ranked members
of the staff.
Both men have been associate
editors during the present vol
ume, and each has an outstanding
journalistic record at Stanford to
hack up his claims to the editor
ship.
Jones came on the staff in his
freshman year, was Associated Press
editor in his sophomore year, and
out of school for a period because of
v serious automobile accidcnt. He is
the newly elected president of Sigma
Delta Chi, honorary men's journal
istic fraternity.

Orr transferred in his junior year
from San Diego Junior College, rose
quickly through all the ranks on the
staff to night editor, was news edi
tor last fall, and an associate editor
this spring. In addition to his cam
pus newspaper work, Orr also is a
correspondent for International
News Service.
Members of the present board will
meet after casting their ballots to
day, and make appointments for the
new volume beginning in October.
Both the staff election and appoint
ments to executive positions will
take place simultaneously. Results
will be posted on the Daily bulletin
board some time before G o'clock.
