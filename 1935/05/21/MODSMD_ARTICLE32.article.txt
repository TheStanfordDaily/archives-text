# The
						Big Election Once Again; Good Luck to All
## 
### 
With Ihe situation well in hand, Stanford
trudges to the polls today to elect its new
A.S.S.I'. president, its new Kxeeutive Com
mittee officials, class ofliccrs, and all other
important posts.
II earlier there was ;i definite Hall-Row
political alignment, it seems to have largely
disappeared for this election at least. It indi
cates that people around this school are doing
a little hit of thinking, and a little less of fol
lowing the leader. Or inayhe it's only that
everyone is too husy contracting a case of
measles to care much who will preside over
his student hody fees next year.
It is important that at least one-half the
student hody— 170(1 men and women turn
out to vote today. In the other two elections
this quarter, a combined total of thirteen
hundred people came to the polls, hut today
is the most significant election of the entire
school year and for this reason everyone
should feci obligated to cast a ballot for his
intended representatives.
There are hut few things to remember when
casting your ballots; many candidates are
running for the different offices, but if the
criteria of selecting candidates are capability,
proven ability in student leadership, and loy
ally to the best interests of the I'niversitv, no
mistakes can possibly be made today.
