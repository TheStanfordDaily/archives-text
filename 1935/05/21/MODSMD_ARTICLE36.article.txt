# WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE NEW DEAL?
## 
### CROMPTON BANGS, Jr 
OUR PRESIDENT: RIGHT OR WRONG
WASHINGTON. DC., May 14.—1n the White House
sits a man with the biggest job in the world. With the
possible exception of Coolidge, every President since
Wilson has had a bigger job than his predecessor.
Under Roosevelt II the already big job doubled in
size and shows no signs of letting up. Under our
system of government (1935 model) the President
holds all the reins. He is the only one who can calm
the unruly and disorganized horses of the New Deal
team. Let's see how well he has done.
Much of F.R.'s great popularity dates from His now
famous radio talk just before the end of the March
193.1 banking holiday. A fair guess would be that he
acquired two million followers as a result. He has
probably lost fully as many in the past ye n- by failing
to notice a pronounced drift in public opinion.
When the President took ollice in the darkest
days of the depression, nobody could sell what
they had. so they thought there must be too much
of everything. Naturally, most people favored any
thing to get rid of overproduction and prevent it
in the future. So the NRA and the AAA were
very popular, while the CWA (now FERA), the
PWA, and the dollar devaluation were violently
opposed by many.
Now with business definitely, though jerkily on the
upgrade, the picture is changed. Relief, devaluation,
etc., are generally accepted as an accomplished fact.
T his is because they have had the tendency to stimu
late business. But on the other hand, AAA and NRA
are very much under fire, and the latter is likely to
die a natural death, or pass out by inches. This is
because these policies have tended to restrict many
businesses just when.the chance for profits is looking
better.
So (he country has apparently accepted the
policies which stimulate business and is getting
doubtful of those that restrict it. So the more ef
fective the stimulants, the more the controls will
be disliked. Thus F.R.'s leadership is likely to de
cline as lon gas he fails to notice the present drift
of opinio in favor of less business control and
more stimulation. So Mr. Roosevelt is likely to be
the first President to lose prestige and popularity
as prosperity increases.

Now with business definitely, though jerkily on the

are very much under fire, and the latter is likely to
die a natural death, or pass out by inches. This is
because these policies have tended to restrict many
businesses just when.the chance for profits is looking
better.
So (he country has apparently accepted the
policies which stimulate business and is getting
doubtful of those that restrict it. So the more ef
fective the stimulants, the more the controls will
be disliked. Thus F.R.'s leadership is likely to de
cline as lon gas he fails to notice the present drift
of opinio in favor of less business control and
more stimulation. So Mr. Roosevelt is likely to be
the first President to lose prestige and popularity
as prosperity increases.
