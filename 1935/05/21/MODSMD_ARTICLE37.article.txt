## WITH ARTHUR M. CATHCART 
### CEDRIC LARSON 
The validity of California's Criminal Syndicalism
Act was upheld by the American Supreme Court, as
discussed yesterday.
"By this time it should be perfectly clear that
when it comes to holding a man responsible for
what he has spoken or written or printed, as distin
guished from imposing a press censorship, the state
legislature, acting under the police power, may consti
tutionally impose many restrictions in the interest of
the public welfare," declares Professor Arthur H.
Cathcart.
"Liberty of speech and of the press, like liberty of
contract, is subject to that power. But the due process
clause forbids arbitrary action. And in deciding what
is arbitrary the courts do not forget that freedom to
express one's opinions upon all economic, social, po
litical, moral, and religious questions is one of the
great ideals of the American revolutionists and has
always been jealously guarded by the American
people."
A very important case involving this point was the
case of testing the consiitutionality of the California
red flag law. A ftfiss Stromberg, member of the Young
Communist League, was supervisor of an outdoor
school for children at a camp in San Bernardino
mountains.
The charge was that she directed the raising of a
red flag (a replica of the red flag of the U.S.S.R.) at a
daily ceremony. The question at issue was: Did she
have the flag raised as "an emblem of opposition to
organized government?"
The Supreme Court saw the fatal objection to the
case in that "opposition to organized government" was
too vague, and "might mean no more than peaceful
and orderly opposition tp government organized and
controlled by one political party or such opposition as
an institution."
The red flag might not be used as a symbol of ad
vocacy of force and violence in disrupting organized
government, but the court maintained the right of
every individual to participate in a peaceful and or
derly opposition to government as it exists.
"Thus we see that in spite of all the things it does
not mean, free speech does mean something after all,"
states Professor Cathcart. "Mr. Richberg himself has
no constitutional rights to use force and violence for
preserving the NRA or to urge others to do so.
"And whatever others may do in advocating their
causes the communist may do. He has as much right
to advocate his system as I have to oppose it. But both
of us must proceed with decent respect to the rights
of others and to the peace and order of society. And
if we do the Constitution will protect us from legisla
tive or administrative interference. What more could
either of us reasonably ask?"

no constitutional rights to use force and violence for
preserving the NRA or to urge others to do so.
"And whatever others may do in advocating their
causes the communist may do. He has as much right
to advocate his system as I have to oppose it. But both
of us must proceed with decent respect to the rights
of others and to the peace and order of society. And
if we do the Constitution will protect us from legisla
tive or administrative interference. What more could
either of us reasonably ask?"
The validity of California's Criminal Syndicalism
Act was upheld by the American Supreme Court, as
discussed yesterday.
"By this time it should be perfectly clear that
when it comes to holding a man responsible for
what he has spoken or written or printed, as distin
guished from imposing a press censorship, the state
legislature, acting under the police power, may consti
tutionally impose many restrictions in the interest of
the public welfare," declares Professor Arthur H.
Cathcart.
"Liberty of speech and of the press, like liberty of
contract, is subject to that power. But the due process
clause forbids arbitrary action. And in deciding what
is arbitrary the courts do not forget that freedom to
express one's opinions upon all economic, social, po
litical, moral, and religious questions is one of the
great ideals of the American revolutionists and has
always been jealously guarded by the American
people."
A very important case involving this point was the
case of testing the consiitutionality of the California
red flag law. A ftfiss Stromberg, member of the Young
Communist League, was supervisor of an outdoor
school for children at a camp in San Bernardino
mountains.
The charge was that she directed the raising of a
red flag (a replica of the red flag of the U.S.S.R.) at a
daily ceremony. The question at issue was: Did she
have the flag raised as "an emblem of opposition to
organized government?"
The Supreme Court saw the fatal objection to the
case in that "opposition to organized government" was
too vague, and "might mean no more than peaceful
and orderly opposition tp government organized and
controlled by one political party or such opposition as
an institution."
The red flag might not be used as a symbol of ad
vocacy of force and violence in disrupting organized
government, but the court maintained the right of
every individual to participate in a peaceful and or
derly opposition to government as it exists.
"Thus we see that in spite of all the things it does
not mean, free speech does mean something after all,"
states Professor Cathcart. "Mr. Richberg himself has
no constitutional rights to use force and violence for
preserving the NRA or to urge others to do so.
