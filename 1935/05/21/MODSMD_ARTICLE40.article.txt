## WOLF! WOLF! 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Through your columns I hope to
reach the authorities who installed
in Encina the new toy which gives
local application to Aesop's fable of '
"Wolf, wolf!" No one in the hall I
has heeded the two false alarms, one :
Thursday and the other Saturday, i
and no one ever will as long as the
glass is so conveniently awaiting a ,
sharp tap. If there ever is a serious
fire most of the residents will be j
like the fabled villagers—chafing un
til someone stifles the alarmist.
May not the alarm boxes be in- [
stalled in the office and in the spon
sors' rooms? Signs can be placed
conveniently to direct anyone who
discovers a fire to the proper rooms.
In the meantime, the University
hath murdered sleep.
