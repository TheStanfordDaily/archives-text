# WHAT A TRACK!
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Everybody seems to be airing his I
gripe about the track situation: the 1
track, the general layout, the con
dition of the throwing grounds have
been criticized. I'd like to say some
thing about the jumping pits.
The broad jump runway leans j
from side to side at an angle ap- i
proaching 45 degrees; the take-off j
board looks like a mouse-gnawed
two-year-old hunk of Swiss cheese;
the sand is half dust, and so dry
most of the time that the exact dis
tance of the hump cannot be ascer
tained within less than two or three
feet.
On many a day the high-jump
take-off looks and feels like a soft
garden bed after a Dakota dust
storm. You can't get any more push
off it than you can off quicksand;
the take-off is even softer than the
pit at times. The sawdust in the pit
is so old that, it is half petrified
from sediments left there by rain
during all past winters since Lor' i

knows when. If the pole vault pit
is as bad as the high-jump pit, it's no
wonder that our vaulters (who, after
all, are pretty fair) should have had
so much trouble this year. They
really look as if they took a beating
continually.
Palo Alto High track men, classes
A to D, whether jumpers or not, use
the pits before we do—and possibly
more than we do; this in no way
betters the condition of said pits.
The designers of the track had a
swell sense of humor, though. The
broad jumpers start their run di
rectly under the high-\iump bar.
With this arrangement, the high
jumpers risk not only their own lives
but those of the broadjumpers as
well.
We need a r.ew layout. The carer
takers, gardeners, and managers
have done their best with the old
weed-patch: W can't hold out much
longer.
I feel much better now.
Sincerely,
Humbert Smith
