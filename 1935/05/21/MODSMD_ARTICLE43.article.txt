HUMOR VS. VULGARITY
Humor consists of saying the right
thing at the wrong time. But when
you say the wrong thing at the
wrong time, that is not humor but
vulgarity. Vulgarity in its broadest
| sense — denoting the cheap, the
i coarse, and the common.
j As an alleged form of amusement,
' vulgarity falls into two categories:
(1) That which is consciously vul
gar, and (2) that which ',a unwitting
-1 ly vulgar. Of the two, we much pre
; fer the former. For it is impossible
to reason with a person who says
"I didn't mean to do it."
Conscious vulgarity — standing
, forth bold and bare, unadorned by
I artifice or apology—is best typified
j by the Encina "dirty story," the bur-
I lesque show, and the circus. In each
j case, the appeal is an appeal to ig
\ norance. Ignorance of "life" (in
i quotes), or of the finer things in
I life (in and out of quotes). It is
! ignorance in either case: whether it
i be derived from sexual repression,
lor from cultural sterility. There is
! no attempt at subtlety, no sophisti
j cation, you pay your monoy and you
j get your dirt. But at least you know
what you are getting.
Unwitting vulgarity is what hap
; pens when the cup runs dry. When
I the snappy phaeton strips its gears
on the highroad to humor, that aw
: ful grating sound is vulgarity.
If conscious vulgarity is an ad-
I mission of ignorance (or of a desire
to appeal to ignorance), then un
witting vulgarity is an admission of
what has recently been labelled
j "mental halitosis." If conscious vul-
I garitv is a social phenomenon, then
I unwitting vulgarity is an argument
for applied eugenics.
For the same reason that there
I are more Jean Harlows than Kath
! arine Cornells (and for the same rea
| son that the Harlows are more pop
ular), humor is far rarer than vul
garity. It is said that the outside
world looks to the universities of
the land for an uplift in the cultural
tastes of the nation. Poor outside
world.

HUMOR VS. VULGARITY
Humor consists of saying the right
thing at the wrong time. But when
you say the wrong thing at the
wrong time, that is not humor but
vulgarity. Vulgarity in its broadest
| sense — denoting the cheap, the
i coarse, and the common.
j As an alleged form of amusement,
' vulgarity falls into two categories:
(1) That which is consciously vul
gar, and (2) that which ',a unwitting
-1 ly vulgar. Of the two, we much pre
; fer the former. For it is impossible
to reason with a person who says
"I didn't mean to do it."
Conscious vulgarity — standing
, forth bold and bare, unadorned by
I artifice or apology—is best typified
j by the Encina "dirty story," the bur-
I lesque show, and the circus. In each
j case, the appeal is an appeal to ig
\ norance. Ignorance of "life" (in
i quotes), or of the finer things in
I life (in and out of quotes). It is
! ignorance in either case: whether it
i be derived from sexual repression,
lor from cultural sterility. There is
! no attempt at subtlety, no sophisti
j cation, you pay your monoy and you
j get your dirt. But at least you know
what you are getting.
Unwitting vulgarity is what hap
; pens when the cup runs dry. When
I the snappy phaeton strips its gears
on the highroad to humor, that aw
: ful grating sound is vulgarity.
If conscious vulgarity is an ad-
I mission of ignorance (or of a desire
to appeal to ignorance), then un
witting vulgarity is an admission of
what has recently been labelled
j "mental halitosis." If conscious vul-
I garitv is a social phenomenon, then
I unwitting vulgarity is an argument
for applied eugenics.
For the same reason that there
I are more Jean Harlows than Kath
! arine Cornells (and for the same rea
| son that the Harlows are more pop
ular), humor is far rarer than vul
garity. It is said that the outside
world looks to the universities of
the land for an uplift in the cultural
tastes of the nation. Poor outside
world.
