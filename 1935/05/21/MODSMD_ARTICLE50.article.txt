# 'Pest House' Lauded As Delightful Vacation Spot
## 
### DAVE BOTSFORD 
Four or five days you have to stay,
! but it's fun, fun.
i The Stanford Isolation Home, de
! serted except by the caretakers for
j Ihe last four years, is not like a hos
j pital. It's more of a summer resort,
j a delightful spot for a short vacation
1 from school. Tall pines sway in the
! breeze—a quiet stream meanders
! through the country-side—white
; chickens peck their way around.
Life at the "pest house" is lazy,
I peaceful, and good.
Victims Happy
Saturday noon there were 35 or 40
measles victims whimpering about
! not seeing the track meet but liking
I the place all the same. Some were
' playing bridge or black-jack on the
i lawn, others across the road on a
' picnic park's baseball diamond were
1 enjoying a game of soft-ball, but
| scarce indeed were those caught
studying.
j Located just three miles south
' west of the chapel, the Isolation
■ Home was built in 1916, the old Palo

Alto Hospital being without an iso
lation ward. Since the completion
of the new hospital with its modern
ward for contagious diseases, the
"pest house" has not been in use.
B.A.C. officials insisted it be kept
ready for such a campus epidemic
as the present measles attack.
Study Magazines
New arrivals at the Home — the
main hospital sends all men with
measles there, keeping the women—
I invariably bring an armful of books,
j notes, magazines', and a deck of
; cards. Within an hour, however,
the books and notes are discarded,
the magazines and cards hold all in
terest. The atmosphere just isn't
conducive to studying.
Yvonne Fay, in charge of the hos
pitalization of all epidemic victims,
requires all Home inmates to wear
pajamas, bathro be, and slippers,
| not so much for health's sake, but in
! such rig it is a bit awkward to be
found straying too far along neigh
i boring roads.
