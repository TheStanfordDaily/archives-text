I " G' MEN"
At the Stanford Theater
This is a rehash of the old "cop'n
robber" gangster film, into which
, the Legion of Decency inserts a
; rather large thumb. The result is
that sympathy is no longer with the
exciting adventures of the hunted
! gangster, but switches to the forces

of law and order
— who provide
just as many
thrills, and re
prove the theory
that the patriotic
theme is always
good entertain
ment material.

James Cagney. as the upright De
partment of Justice man, gets just
( as tough with crooks as he did with
! cops in his "public enemy" roles,
j Ann Dvorak and Margaret Lindsay
| add the feminine touch in a tho
j roughly satisfactory manner and
Robert Armstrong takes his usual
"I'm - hard-to-handle-but-0.K.-at
heat" roles. I still think that Pop
j eye in "Choose Your Weppins" is
the best part of the program.
