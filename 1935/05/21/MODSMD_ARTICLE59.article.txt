Just one more heavy week-end
. for Sammy Klopstock, and then a
I few weeks' rest. Over a month ago
he started in a doubling-up program,
meeting the opponents' best in the
highs, and then coming back 30 min-
I utes later to face a fresh man in
| the lows. And the opponents were,
| as a group, the classiest bunch of
! hurdlers ever to compete for the
. Coast. Many of them gave every
' thing in one race, while Sammy was
j counted on for points in both.
In the Big Meet he won the
highs, and was third in ihe lows.
In some way or other lie won both
against the Trojans. At the Fresno
; Relays he had his bad (light, and
I was fourth. Last Saturday he
won the highs going away, but
| heats were too much, and he faded
into third place in the lows.
| Just one more Saturday now.
Whoever the other entries are, it
will be the same fierce competition
with Moore and Cope and Wood in
I the highs and Hall, Paul, Fishback,
J and Strother in the lows. Five weeks
ago we decided Sammy would be a
i superman if he broke even in first
| places with his ace opponents.
I That's his average now, and he
j stands every chance of continuing it
i through the coming all-important

i 1.C.4-A.
Speaking of high class hurdling.
Hunt Kingsbury, Stanford's sec
ond man, was clocked in 14.5 sec
onds in the famed high hurdle
race at Fresno, »nd just slipped in
for fifth place. Whatta life!

Saturday the intense rivalry bc
l ween the quarter milers of U.C.L.A.
and U.S.C. ended up in favor of the
determined Bruins. They had re
i venge for a lacing at the Fresno
| Relays, when the Trojans won the
mile relay easily and anchormen
LuValle and McCarthy engaged in a
most routine handshake.
In the quarter mile U.C.L.A.'s Lu-
Valle controlled the event the whole
way and won by five yards in the
greatest exhibition of one-lap racing
1 seen on the Coast this year. Lu-
Valle was able to run the last lap as
I he wished aLso, thanks to the lead
| taken by Ray Vejar, a great runner
I who was mysteriously in the ruck
J until Saturday.

California's Captain - elect Bob
; Fowler won another from fightin'
i Fred Lantz of the Trojans, but the
! time was disappointing. Fowler
I hasn't run across a runner on the
| Coast yet who can match his spirit
' on the home stretch, and as a re
isult his times have been just fast
j enough to win.
They are already predicting,
| however, that Fowler's graph will
have to take a sharp turn down
; ward next year if he wants to keep
i it clean of a big black "X" for a
: dual meet defeat. Stanford's Ed
! son Burrows, a long-striding lad
from the north tlr»t produced Hill
I and Bright and other distance aces,
I will he pushing the best, and at
: last the two-mile record will
I go.
About Fowler's graph, though. He
I started it five years ago when he
i began running for the first time. It
j took a good deal of encouragement
to get him on a track (the encour
oger was a Stanford man of '35,
Fowler admits), but oncc he started
his interest increased rapidly. His
graph for the mile run started in a
14:53, I think, but it looked like a
1 1930 stocks and bonds graph before
long. The red line that goes for
j Big Meet two-miles must go below
j the ordinate for 9 minutes and 38
I seconds next April, for it will be
Fowler's last try at the 8-year-old
I record, a mark which he was re
! garded as a cinch to eclipse in his
J sophomore year.

he started in a doubling-up program,
meeting the opponents' best in the

| as a group, the classiest bunch of
! hurdlers ever to compete for the

' thing in one race, while Sammy was
j counted on for points in both.
In the Big Meet he won the
highs, and was third in ihe lows.
In some way or other lie won both

; Relays he had his bad (light, and
I was fourth. Last Saturday he
won the highs going away, but
| heats were too much, and he faded

| Just one more Saturday now.
Whoever the other entries are, it
