# 'Quid' Chappie Scheduled To Go on Sale June 6
## 
### 
The final number of Chaparral,
the traditional ''Quid" burlesque on
the Stanford Quad, will appear just
before the beginning of finals on
June G, according to Venerable
Cuckoo Gordon Steedman.
With The Daily closed down, and
nothing for the students to do but
Co to sleep in the Reserved Book
Room, Chappie feels that it's up to
the Hammer and Coffin boys to do
their duty.
"Of course, this will be the best
and funniest Chappie of the year,"
says Steedman. "We can say that
without fear of hurting future sales,
since it will be our last issue."
