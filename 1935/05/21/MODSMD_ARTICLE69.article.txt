# FARM PLATERS LOSE NET TILTS
## Four Stanford Men Downed In Coast Tournament 
### 
Eliminated in matches played Fri
day and Saturday, Johnny Law,
Ben Dey, Bill Seward, and Bob Un
derwood, Stanford tennis players,
\ found the field too fast in the an
j nual Pacific Coast doubles tourna
ment, staged at Santa Barbara over
i the week-end.

, The chances of Seward and Dey
were dealt a severe blow when the
former contracted measles during
the tourney. The Farm sophomores
â–  were defeated by Joe Hunt and Tro
jan Jack Knetneyer in four sets.
Law, teamed with John Sisson,
prominent member of the Los An
geles Tennis Club, lost to Dolf
Meuhleisen and Alan Harrington,
Southern California doubles cham
pions, who went on to win that
event.

Underwood, with Lawrence Nel
son. another leading Southern Cali
fornian, was also conquered by
Meuhleisen and Harrington. Law
dropped a 6-3 decision in a one-set
exhibition singles match with Frank
Shields, one of the nation's leading
amateur players.

A survey at the University of
Washington showed that the women
frequent the library more than do
the men.
