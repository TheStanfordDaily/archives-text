Dale Controversy
Granting dates assumed a hither
to unknown prominence in Ex Com
mittee, when the measles epidemic
was reflected in a controversy over
granting dates for this week-end. Ex
Committee at first refused to grant
any further dates, then thought bet
ter of it, deciding to grant dates on
the condition that the dance chair
man interview the health service,
and then thought better of it again,
on the appearance of Dr. Thomas A.
Storey, director of University Health
Service, who explained his stand.
It turned out that there was only
one date to be approved after this
week-end: a Class of '35 jolly-up
May 30. This was given a tentative
okay, pending the dance chairman's
securing permission from the Health
Service.
All election results were accepted.
