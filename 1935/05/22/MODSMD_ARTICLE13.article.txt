# MEASLES CAUSE DATE-CANCELING
## Dr. Storey Fears Third Peak in Epidemic 
### 
The Junior Prom with its Queen
Contest and all other campus dances
scheduled for this week-end have
been cancelled by Ex Committee be
cause of the measles epidemic.
According to Marvie Kahn, any
organization that has been granted
a date for next week or for the re
mainder of the quarter must see Dr.
Thomas Storey and obtain his ap
proval before the dance will be al
lowed to go on.
As the epidemic peaks are two
weeks apart the next wave will oc
cur during the end-quarter exam
inations, and it is for this reason,
says Dr. Storey, that action on the
dances has to take place. Though
there will probably be some who will
have the measles during finals, such
action will greatly reduce the num
ber .
Such social functions as the Folies
Bourgeois, lectures, and concerts
will not be called off, as they do not
entail the close personal contact that
makes the danger of contagion so
great at dances.
A slight decrease in the number of
cases is shown in yesterday's figure
of 108, with 53 patients being con
fined in both the Palo Alto and Iso
lation hospitals.
