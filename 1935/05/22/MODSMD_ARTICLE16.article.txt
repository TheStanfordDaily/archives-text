Slang does not arise merely be
cause of the intellectual poverty of
the speaker, or his association with
special occupational and social
groups; but, in young people, from
a desire to say things in a newer and
fresher way.
This point of view is taken by Dr.
Arthur G. Kennedy, professor of
English philology, in "Current Eng

and Company for publication on
August 15. The volume it; a study of
present-day usages and tendencies
of the English language.
