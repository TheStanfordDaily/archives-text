# Frosh Fills Hero Role In Carmel Theater Fire
## 
### ROBERT EISENBACH 
Clothes make the firemanâ€”Car
mel's head smoke-eater Ben Leidig,
and Dick Paddock. 20-ycar-old
freshman, had that fact proved to
them at the spectacular artist
colony fire Sunday night.
Without his uniform the chief,
who is also the fire department, was
just a bystander. With it, Freshman
Paddock directed fire-fighters and
afTected rescues with the non
chalance of a veteran.
"It was fate," he said today, still
dazed by his experience. "All I re
member is that the chief shed his
fireman's cap and coat while work
ing to save the Golden Bough The
ater, and I put them on and took his
place."
Dick, to whom fire is something in
a stove, covered himself with glory
arid filled himself with free break
fast as the result of his work.

It was he who aided Frank J.
Jacott, telephone company employee,
m the famous "nobody home" rescue
attempt. It was just an attempt,
I Dick emphasizes, since the mythical
> maiden allegedly trapped by the
i flames wasn't trapped at all, but safe
on the outside. To redeem himself,
Fireman Paddock made a one-man
dash to the theater projection room,
rescuing a feature picture (chock
full of romance), a comedy, and a
| newsrcel.
"Did I burn Chief Lcidig up!" he
| grins.
Dick doesn't know whether it was
because, or in spite of, his efforts
that damage totaled $75,000. but he
j does know that his efforts were oflfi
j cially appreciated. "The mayor
! pumped my hand and said I could
, t.tke anything I wanted as a sou
i venir."
Dick took Chief Leidig's hat.
