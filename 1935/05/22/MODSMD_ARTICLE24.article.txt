is not the tiny desert island most
people imagine it, but instead a
fertile continent the size of the
United Stales, Arthur H. O'Connor
emphasized in his lecture in the As
sembly Hall last night on "Australia
and the South Seas."
Although the entire continent has
a population smaller than that of
New York City, the Australian pre
dicts a great boom for his country in
the coming century. In three reels of
film he revealed the beauty and po
tentialities of thus country.

Among the scenes of beauty
caught by the color camera were
those of marine life taken off the
Great, Barrier reef on the cast coast
of Australia, a coral reef over 1200
miles in length.
As far as government is con
cerned, the lecturer felt that Aus
tralia has solved her problems very
well. All public utilities are owned
by the people, and there is little or
no sentiment in favor of private
ownership.
Pensions Given
Other social legislation which the
United States is only now consider
ing but which has been in effect in
Australia for more than 20 years is
