A.S.S.U. for 1»:{5-:J« as a rccord number of students turned out for the
annual student body election yesterday. The first count of the ballots
gave Brooke a lead but not enough to give him the clear election. Tabula
tion <>f the second choice votes of the third candidate, Ken Livingston,
gave Brooke a total of K!)(> and Triolo 703.
Election officials estimate that newly 1800 votes were cast yester
day. This high vote surpasses even the vote of last May which was con-

♦ sidered unusually heavy.
Ken Livingston, independent can
