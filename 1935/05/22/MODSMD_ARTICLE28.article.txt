also fairly close. Jacqueline Flan
ders nosed out Dorothy Sweet in
the vice-presidency race by 84!
to 750. Sammy Klopstock won the
B.A.C. position from Gift' Myers.

I contest for senior member of the Ex

W'llly Brooke won a close three-way contest for presidency of the
A.S.S.U. for 1»:{5-:J« as a rccord number of students turned out for the
annual student body election yesterday. The first count of the ballots
gave Brooke a lead but not enough to give him the clear election. Tabula
tion <>f the second choice votes of the third candidate, Ken Livingston,
gave Brooke a total of K!)(> and Triolo 703.
Election officials estimate that newly 1800 votes were cast yester
day. This high vote surpasses even the vote of last May which was con-

♦ sidered unusually heavy.
Ken Livingston, independent can
didate, ran a very close race with
Triolo all through the counting,
and Brooke's superiority was not at
all definite until all the ballots had
been counted. Triolo had only 70
more votes than Livingston after the
first choices had been counted, while
Brooke lead by several hundred.
Brooke has been active in campus
activities during his first three years
here. He is the present president of
the junior class and has served as
sophomore member of the Ex Com
mittee, Rally Committee, 1935 Bon
, fire Committee, and president of the
Pro-medics Club. He won his nu
merals in freshman basketball and
served on several freshman and
sophomore dance committees. He is
| a member of Phi Kappa Psi and was
the candidate holding the support of
; the Row caucus.
Contests for other offices were
also fairly close. Jacqueline Flan
ders nosed out Dorothy Sweet in
the vice-presidency race by 84!
to 750. Sammy Klopstock won the
B.A.C. position from Gift' Myers.
Largest single vote polled by any
I one candidate was that of Bob Gros
i as graduate member of Ex Commit
tee. He garnered 1192 votes to sweep
him into the office. Bob Grayson also
piled up an overwhelming lead in h>s
I contest for senior member of the Ex
i Committee.
Election officials completed their
tabulations of the huge vote in
record time. The results were
| complete four hours after the polls
had closed. A large staff of some
.'5O people were organized to com
plete the count ?.s quickly as pos
sible.
Ex Committee gave their approval
of Chairman John Brock's figures at
their meeting last night. The final
returns are as follows:

W'llly Brooke won a close three-way contest for presidency of the
A.S.S.U. for 1»:{5-:J« as a rccord number of students turned out for the
annual student body election yesterday. The first count of the ballots
gave Brooke a lead but not enough to give him the clear election. Tabula
tion <>f the second choice votes of the third candidate, Ken Livingston,
gave Brooke a total of K!)(> and Triolo 703.
Election officials estimate that newly 1800 votes were cast yester
day. This high vote surpasses even the vote of last May which was con-

♦ sidered unusually heavy.
Ken Livingston, independent can
didate, ran a very close race with
Triolo all through the counting,
and Brooke's superiority was not at
all definite until all the ballots had
been counted. Triolo had only 70
more votes than Livingston after the
first choices had been counted, while
Brooke lead by several hundred.
Brooke has been active in campus
activities during his first three years
here. He is the present president of
the junior class and has served as
sophomore member of the Ex Com
mittee, Rally Committee, 1935 Bon
, fire Committee, and president of the
Pro-medics Club. He won his nu
merals in freshman basketball and
served on several freshman and
sophomore dance committees. He is
| a member of Phi Kappa Psi and was
the candidate holding the support of
; the Row caucus.
Contests for other offices were
also fairly close. Jacqueline Flan
ders nosed out Dorothy Sweet in
the vice-presidency race by 84!
to 750. Sammy Klopstock won the
B.A.C. position from Gift' Myers.
Largest single vote polled by any
I one candidate was that of Bob Gros
i as graduate member of Ex Commit
tee. He garnered 1192 votes to sweep
him into the office. Bob Grayson also
piled up an overwhelming lead in h>s
I contest for senior member of the Ex
i Committee.
