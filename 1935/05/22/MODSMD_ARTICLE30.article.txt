# A 						New Editor-elect; A New Staff— Best Wishes to Both
## 
### 
And so all good things must come lo an
end. Yesterday the campus voted itself a new
set of student heads, but while it was absorbed
in its student body election, the Stanioiu)
Daily went lo its own private little polling
precinct in its own editorial ollicc, and elected
itself a new editor for Volume NX.
Rob Jones was the choice of the stall lor
the editorship of next year's volume. In
winning the highest oflice awarded lo a college
journalist at Stanford, Rob defeated a man
who would have done honor to the editorship
of any university newspaper. Frank Orr la
bored hard and earnestly as a news editor,
as an associate editor, and as a fellow anxious
always lo raise the standards of his chosen
publication. That he did not win out in a close
race detracts no whit from the excellent rec
ord which he set up for himself in two busy
years on the Farm.
Jones is a typical member of the class of \'L~>.
He entered as a freshman three years ago,
and in his knocking around llie campus
learned thoroughly all the institutions of a
secluded Farm. And because he is also in
timately acquainted with the new order of
things, Rob will be able to edit the Daily with
;i wisdom born of close association with stu
dents and faculty.
As his managing editor for the next vol
ume. Jones will have the experience of Phil
Duffy, debonair and slow-drawling chap, who
stepped into his old night editor post four
months ago and maintained a dynamic pace
ever since.
Jane Dodge, adherent of the "old days back
in P.K12," won an exceptionally close race to
become the new women's editor. Known to
many generations of editorial boards as one
of the most enterprising women members of
the stall', "Dodgie" now will have the oppor
tunity to rale, berate, and cajole stall mem
bers to heed her wishes.
Associate editor promotions found John
Kline and Millard Rrowne getting the nod
over all other candidates for the two appren
tice-editor posts. Roth Kline and Rrownie face
the prospect of grinding out editorials to a
cynical campus, Rut both men with distinct
individual writing styles should help to lill up
a super-editorial column next volume.
I-Yoin outstanding talent on the department
editors and copy desk workers come the six
new night editors, Ceorgc Wilson returns to
his old post with a volume of rich experience
to back him up, while Mori D'Fvelyn, Jane
lleenan, Dorothy Sweet, Loren Irwin, Irvin
.lorgensen, and John McClelland lill out these
important posts. Roth women stood out for
their work this quarter, while the new night
editors represent the cream of "star" reporter,
feature writer, layout expert, and sports ex
perl.
To lill in the all-important Associated Press
editor post will be M (you guess) Jack New
man, grinning veteran of many quarters on
llie paper. Pipe in mouth, Newman will sup
ply national and international news lo till the
news columns.
Newly appointed Feature Fditor liarhara
Sweet will at last be able to assign to some
one else her regular assembly hall seat at the
Tuesday lectures. In the review editor post,
a gap hard to lill will lind Phil Rernheim in
there balling hard. His former chief,' Rud
Rrill, eslalished one of the finest theater and
drama columns ever to appear or the Farm.
Rernheim will have a worth-while goal in
attempting to emulate Prill's oulstai'd'ng
work.
News editor finds Dick Hodgson, lop-rank
ing copy editor, dominated to lill the post,
while Cordon Frost will pound out all the
sports material that wends i! way into the
sports columns during the busy football sea
son.
Of the Associated Press desk editors, Vir
ginia Johnson and Annalce Whitinore remain
as veterans to boost up the department,
while Warren Rreed and Henry I'ani slep into
higher positions.
And finally, into copy editor shoes step Dave
Rotsford, Rob Fisenbach. Jones Haw lev, Vir
ginia Ilawkes, Dick Levi, Mel Jacoby, Doro
thy Newman, and Harhara Rosenblatt.
To Rob, congratulations on so fine a stall',
and another about-to-be-relired editor ■» warn

you will have to endure from the pen of the
editor there is still a last edition.
