# WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE NEW DEAL?

This will happen in other strange ways. As AAA
and FERA pour more money into the Middle West, and
as last year's drought and this year's rains bring good
crops at good prices, this usually Republican section is
likely to bite the hand that feeds it and desert the
Democrats.
Even though F.R.'s prestige does decline, future
historians will remember him for three things he did
do: he gave the U.S. hope when it needed it the most;
he gave us action, when we thought action was hope
less; finally, he increased the international prestige of
our country at just the right time.
But still the New Deal machine won't run. We
have seen how F.R. has failed to notice a drift away
from its policies. Why has he failed to notice it?
Very simple. As we do most reform administra
tions, the New Deal h'Ns become almost com
pletely introverted; it has become a mutual ad
miration society which blames all its troubles on
"Wall Street," "sinister influences," "tories,"
"demagogues." It never thinks of looking right at
home for the trouble.
This does not mean that the administration is en
tirely unaware of public opinion the other way. The
president showed that he was making a very unfor
tunate allusion in the last radio chat to his need of
feeling the pulse of the countryâ€”by fishing on Vincent
Astor's yacht or by watching the cows go by at Hyde
Park. This almost apologetic remark shows F.R.
isn't as thick-skinned as he is supposed to be. But
that is as far as it goes. Any constructive criticism of
the New Deal is considered reactionary or anti-social.
The President himself has even gone to absurd
lengths to suppress unfavorable opinion. Several
months ago he wrote a letter to a prominent news
paper publisher asking him to fire one of his Wash
ington correspondents for having written a story about
the administration's efforts to suppress unfavorable
news. The correspondent stuck to his guns, so did the
publisher. The incident was not forgotten; the writer
won a prize for his work. This is given to show how
things are.
All efforts at co-ordination of the New Deal have
failed, partly because of red tape, mostly because
everyone is looking to 1936, and there are too many
good Democrats holding good soft jobs in useless
agencies.
Even more important is the fact that (he President
IS the New Deal. He has to make all the final deci
sions himself; there have been so many of them to
make that neither he nor anyone else has had time
to think things through. Until this is done, all the
new machinery as well as the old will creak and
eventually break down.
It may take a radical overhauling of executive
Washington to do it. but unless this is done, even a
New Deal responsive to public opinion will fall
and drag the President down with it. No iu->n can
be all the government and still do a good job.
Several assistant presidents are needed, but up to
last week Mr. Roosevelt had not found a Moses to
lead him out of the New Deal wilderness of un
co-ordinated policies and self-satisfied politicians.
