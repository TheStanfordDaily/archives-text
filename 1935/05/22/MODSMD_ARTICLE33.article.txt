## WITH ARTHUR M. CATHCART FASCISM AND RELIGION: REINHARDT 
### CEDRIC LARSON 
One of the major problems thrown into bold relief
by the progressive march of political absolutism
across the map of Europe is the status of the church
in the fascist nation.
In Italy, cradle of fascism, Dr. Kurt F. Reinhardt
believes that II Duce has after years of experiment at
la.-t charted a happy course which will keep the
Italian ship of state off the shoals of politico-religious
conflict.
Mussolini has at length realized and stated: "Who
ever harms or destroys the religious foundation of
the nations sins against the soul of the people." He
also rejects the idea of making religion the tool of the
stale, which would be the case if a state would
usurp the influence of the church in order to promote
its own political or economic aims.
The fascist leader's stand here is, as he himself
says, in sharp contrast "to other countries which at
tempt to overthrow the ancient deities by creating new
gospels or dogmas idolizing race, blood, or some form
of Nordic mythology."
The fate of Bismarck's famous "Kulturkampf," and
the sad experience of Napoleon I in crossing swords
with the church in spiritual warfare may well serve
as examples to the more ambitious statesmen of 1935
who would try their prowess in this field.
A state, Mussolini himself has said, can only be
victorious over another political entity, which is a
material reality which can be attacked, dismembered
or transformed. But the very weapons with which a
state wages a war with a foreign enemy are power
less in an onslaught against the cherished spiritual
values of its people.
Mussolini's fascist state, therefore, has made it a
cardinal principle not to meddle with religious ques
tions. The concordat signed between the Roman state
and the Roman church laid to rest a troublesome
issue of allocation of power which had been vexing
Italo-Vatican relations for decades.
The church and state should each function in its
own realm and not interfere in the spheres of the
other, Mussolini holds. A college of cardinals ponder
ing the tonnage of warships, and political leaders
middling with religious dogma, are situations equally
askew.
On the olher hand, there are certain activities in
which church and state can fruitfully co-operate,
clearly recognized by II Duce. such as education, mar
riage laws, science, art, and the press, such matters
being known as "res mixtae."
Dr. Reinhardt feels that Mussolini's conception of
the ideal equilibrium between church and fascist state
squares fully with definitions of canon law in this
real mas promulgated by Leo XIII in his well-known
encyclicals Diuturnum illud (1881) and Sapientiae
christianae (18!)0).
"As the power of the state is never unlimited, so
also the obedience of a Christian citizen to the state
can never be unconditional," declares Dr. Reinhardt.
