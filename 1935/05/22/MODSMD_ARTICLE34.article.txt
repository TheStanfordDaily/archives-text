# BULL SESSION
## AFTER THE BATTLE IS OVER 
### 
The wiggling and the voting dies
away. The bosses and the heelers
now retire. The bloody work is over
—one presidential candidate neatly
knifed by the press, and a series of
Hall men with votes falsely garnered
by handbills labelling them "inde
pendents." But those are the normal
excrescences of political procedure.
Everyone expects them. They prove
merely that Stanford men and wom
en have learned their political sci
ence from politicians and not from
textbooks.
As is natural, dll eyes turn to the
man who won the presidency. In that
weird triangular race, it is not pos
sible to determine how many votes
were cast on the basis of living
group affiliations, or because Jimmy
could lead yells, and Wally could
shoot baskets, and Kenny played a
mean game of water polo. Yet all
those things (which the Man-from-
Mars might think slight qualification
lor a student body president) were
important. The least we can say is
that we have a president. The best
we can say is: "God have mercy on
his soul."
All of the presidential candidates
made certain promises or sidling ap
proximations to promises. One man
is now in the unfortunate position of
being at least morally obligated to
make a fair pretense of doing some
little bit toward making good on
some of those promises (.which cuts
it as thin as is humanly possible).
There was one issue on which the
winning candidate was in agreement
with his two rivals: There must be
more and closer student-faculty co
operation.
That problem was pointedly moot
ed in a series of panel discussions.
It was lelt that the professor should
be more than a lecturing automaton,
and that the student should be more
than a sponge-like receptor; and
that, in any case, the relationship
between automaton and sponge
should be of a more virile sort. With
perhaps a pardonable pride, the
pani'l felt that the panel was one of
the best means of promoting the de
sired better relationship. It will be
the job of the new student body
president to co-operate with the

| panel movement, even as his prede
| eessor has done.
j The losing contestants may con
sole themselves with the fact that
they will not have an Ex* Committee
! to contend with, and that they may
! get up on the right side of bed.
without being criticized for not get
ting up on the wrong
