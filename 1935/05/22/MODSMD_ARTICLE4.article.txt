### 
BERLIN, May 21 (A*). â€” Reichs
fuchrer Hitler tonight blamed Eu
rope's danger-fraught armaments
race squarely on nations victorious
in the World War which imposed the
Versailles Treaty upon Germany.
In an impassioned address to the
Reichstag, summoned into special
session, he scathingly denounced
other powers for violating the pcaee
treaty's arms limitations, thus forc
ing the Reich to rearm.

Thunderously cheered as he pro
nounced his eagerly awaited ad
dress on foreign policy, which the
radio carried to millions throughout
Germany and Europe, the Fuehrer
again protested Germany's desire for
peace.
"If the Germany of today favors
peace," he said, "it favors it neither
out of weakness nor cowardice. . . .
We dccry every war for the subjuga
tion of foreign peoples.
Germany
"Germany of today is immersed
in the tremendous work of repair
ing its domestic damages. None of
our subjects of a factual nature will
J:e completed before 10 or 20 years.
None of our tasks of an ideal nature
can find its fulfillment before 50 or
even 100 years.
"What else could I desire but quiet
and peace?"
He was bitterly sarcastic in his
comment on those who would see in
Germany's armaments cause to fear
war and in other nations' armaments
reason to hope for peace.
