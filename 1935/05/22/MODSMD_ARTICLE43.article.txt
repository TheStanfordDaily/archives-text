"TERRIBLE STUFF"—
IT'S WORSE NOW

It seems time that a piece was
I written about Leo Maier, Stanford's
I crack trainer.
What makes Leo unusual is his in
| conspicuousness: thousands of 1
words a week are written about
Stanford's athletics, but there is
j never a mention of Leo. Of course
I the track men and the football play
; ers have plenty of reason for know-
I ing who "Leo" is: he's the one that
; lakes the soreness out of muscles,
! and sets up arches, and tries to
| straighten out kinks.
Business has been good for Leo
I this spring; it always will he good
} until they fix that hard pan of an
Ang— Whoa, wasn't going to talk
about that any more.
Everybody gets the same treat
! ment from Leo, which seems a vir- !
tue in a place which likes its all
! Americans, its "Seven Avengers"—
: its stars. A scrub on a frosh team .
I gets the same treatment, and lots
of encouragement besides, as na
! tional champion from masseur Maier.
Leo has been the "they" in most
of the "so they say's" of this col
! umn during the last three months. j
i And alongside Leo in Fresno after
j the relays a couple of weeks ago |
I ended a Diogenes-like search for,
the man who spoke the truth. "Gee," ,
!he said unconsciously, quietly, as
J though he couldn't help himself. !
' "Gee, but you have written some j
terrible stuff."
Now I've gotten back. "Terrible"
1 will be mild now.

JUST A DASII—
IF YOU CAN

It's the wind-up today for this |
Sideliner, and time for the tradi- ,
tional letter to the new sport ed, ]
which goes like this: '"Dear Lem: |
Welcome to your new job. I !
know you will make a whale of a j
success of it. . . . Just don't believe
everything everybody tells you. . . . |
You will have the privilege of re- j
cording a banner .sport season . . . '
ad infinitum."
Now that that's over with, it is
worth saying that The Daily spoil
editorship is a game. I batted
about .125, which is like a round I
in the high !)o's. or a 5:04 mile, or !
a fumbled lateral.
The object is to ge* the news be

! fore the San Francisco scribes do.
[ Plenty of "copy" is written each
day about Farm sports, and it does
seem likely that The Daily should
j get some of it first.
But just try it. All the scheduled
events, of course, are described in
i the Sunday city papers and The
Daily can't help but be 24 hours
late. The big sport story of the
spring quarter was the decision to
i send a team to the 1.C.4-A. Though
anticipated, we cracked through
with a yarn 48 hours after it was
i bannered by the S.F. dailies.
Another good study was Norm
Bright's 9:20 mile. We tied the
others on that one, but somehow or
other an error was made in the
time between the copy paper and
j the Stanford press, and Bright's
mile wasn't nearly as sensational
on our sport page as it wts on the
| others. We did scoop 'em in—in
; terclass soccer
Next fall it will be worse. Harry
Borba, Bill Leiser, Roy Cummings,
and the others will be down to
| watch the grid practices two or
three times a week, and getting news
into the stories will be as hard as
j getting a prep football ace out of
Southern California.

anticipated, we cracked through
with a yarn 48 hours after it was

Another good study was Norm

other an error was made in the

"TERRIBLE STUFF"—

I written about Leo Maier, Stanford's
I crack trainer.
What makes Leo unusual is his in
| conspicuousness: thousands of 1
words a week are written about
Stanford's athletics, but there is
j never a mention of Leo. Of course
I the track men and the football play
; ers have plenty of reason for know-
I ing who "Leo" is: he's the one that
; lakes the soreness out of muscles,
! and sets up arches, and tries to
| straighten out kinks.
Business has been good for Leo
I this spring; it always will he good
} until they fix that hard pan of an
Ang— Whoa, wasn't going to talk
about that any more.
Everybody gets the same treat
! ment from Leo, which seems a vir- !
tue in a place which likes its all
! Americans, its "Seven Avengers"—
: its stars. A scrub on a frosh team .
I gets the same treatment, and lots
of encouragement besides, as na
