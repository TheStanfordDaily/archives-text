i There is still a haze of uncertainty
surrounding Stanford's 1.C.4-A. team '
lor 1935, but Coach Dink Temple- 1
ton still has four days to make his
final choice. Dink was positive of
two things last night, however.
1. Stafford's team will include not j
I less than three —Sammy Klopstock,
Johnny Mottram, and Jim Reynolds, j
2. The team may be enlarged to
six, but not more. Dink has Dud j
i Sales ; nd Humbert Smith in mind '
! as possible members with Phil Levy
as a sure traveler if his eligibility
can be established.
Smith, Sales May Go
This afternoon the two doubtfuls, ,
j Smith and Sales, will be put on the ;
j testing block. If Smitty can prove
! that his leg injury has improved
| sufficiently to warrant his jumping j
| in eastern competition, and if Dud's :
I javelin tossing shows him to still
be on the upgrade, Stanford can |
count on these two as representatives j
at Boston.
Then if word is received from the
1.C.4-A. committee on eligibility al- j
i lowing Levy to throw the discus, he
will be there, too.
Saturday night Stanford's team, !
j lie it three or six, will entrain for i
Boston with California's squad of
13 athletes. Cal Coach Brutus t
j Hamilton will take over the reins as ,
; Stanford mentor during the trip. |
j Dink Templeton's health forbids his ■
j making the jaunt.

During his workout yesterday af
j ternoon, Sammy Klopstock gave fur

presence known in 1.C.4-A. competi
! tion. Sam ran a flight of highs in
! 14.7 and then turned around less ,
j than 15 minutes later to stop the
| watches at 14.4. Hunt Kingsbury
was right on his heels in both races, i
Templeton expressed the belief

final choice. Dink was positive of
two things last night, however.
1. Stafford's team will include not j
I less than three —Sammy Klopstock,
Johnny Mottram, and Jim Reynolds, j
2. The team may be enlarged to
six, but not more. Dink has Dud j
i Sales ; nd Humbert Smith in mind '
! as possible members with Phil Levy
as a sure traveler if his eligibility
can be established.
Smith, Sales May Go
This afternoon the two doubtfuls, ,
j Smith and Sales, will be put on the ;
j testing block. If Smitty can prove
! that his leg injury has improved
| sufficiently to warrant his jumping j
| in eastern competition, and if Dud's :
I javelin tossing shows him to still
be on the upgrade, Stanford can |
count on these two as representatives j
at Boston.
Then if word is received from the
1.C.4-A. committee on eligibility al- j

will be there, too.
Saturday night Stanford's team, !

Boston with California's squad of
13 athletes. Cal Coach Brutus t
