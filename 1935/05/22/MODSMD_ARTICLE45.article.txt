# LITTLE SWEEPS TOWARD GROWN

### 
ST. ANNES-ON-THE-SEA. Eng
land, May 21 <>Pl.—Shaking off the
blight which attacked his game yes
terday, William Lawson Little, Jr.,
came back with a roar today in the
second round of the British amateur
golf championship to blast Former
Champion Eric Martin Smith out of
the running, 4 and 3, and once again
; established himself the overwhelm-
I ing favorite to retain the title — a
feat accomplished only twice in the
i 50 years of the tournament.
I Where nightfall yesterday, fol
lowing his ragged one-up victory
over an obscure player, found the
galleryites sadly striking their
heads predicting his early demise,
tonight witnessed only a wild and
enthusiastic rush to jump on the
i husky champion's bandwagon.
With the defeated Jock McLean,
! the Scottish idol, who was the vic
' tim of a first-round upset, standing
! behind him offering advice, and
Henry Cotton, British open king, in
; the gallery, Little, from the start,
played almost the same dazzling
j game.
No one of the gallery of approxi
i inately 2000, which watched him
1 shoot even fours at Smith for the
15 holes their match lasted, could
picture his defeat at the hands of
j :tny player left in the field.
