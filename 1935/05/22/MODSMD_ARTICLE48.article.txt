First measles — then a meager
crowd — handicapped Sword and
Sandals in their reading of Ibsen's
"Hedda Gabler." But the cast over
came both and presented a note
worthy interpretation of the famed
play.
Annelies Morgan, slated to fill the
title role, was taken to the hospital
the afternoon of the performance.
Miry Liles stepped imo her place
and, with three hours preparation,
gave a performance which was al
most above improvement.
Liles dominated the reading. Her
pauses, her low, well-modulated
voice, resulted in a Hedda Gabler
both understandable and real.
Amelia Baines, in the role of Aunt
Juliana, made the most of her lines.
Her accent was well done, but her
dramatic reading contrasted oddly
with Liles' restraint in their scene
together.
Fred Clark, as Jorgen Tesman,
was excellent but perhaps over
directed. "Eh?" and "Fancy
that!" were entirely foreign to him,
but well done.
Waldo Salt, veteran of many
readings, was capable as always.
Robert Garred surprised by his por
trayal of Eilert Lovborg. His pre
vious experience consisted only of
"Yellow Jack," in which he filled the
part of Stokes.
Kay Campbell was inexperienced
as Mrs. Elvsted, and several times
came close to over-acting. Josephine
Avis completed the cast as the maid.
Joe Lawry, director, also read
stage directions. Another week of
practice would have improved the
entire cast. However, when the last
minute change of characters is taken
into account, the reading was ex
tremely effective — especially Mary
Liles' expert, although almost ex
temporaneous, portrayal of Hedda.
