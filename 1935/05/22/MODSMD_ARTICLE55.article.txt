# DRIPPINGS FROM THE PEN OF ULPH
## 
### 
Tlie Editor, Sir:
I find most amusing the Da'ily's
orgasm of humor, the so-called Razz
Edition, which, subjected to a crit
ical analysis, reveals its true color,
u conglomerate mass of hooliganism,
trumpery, hypocrisy, and sheer un
adulterated "grut." What fun you
all must have had writing it.
Even more humorous, even more
grut-like do I find the editorial of
Tuesday following labelled, "The
Razz Issueâ€”A Good Thing." To
quote: "For once The Stanford
Daily was appreciated," is a belly
laugh all by itself. Other statements,
however, need explanation.
"Nothing is so sacred that it can
not be placed above the pale of
common touch." Vainly, in the face
of such liberalism, do I seek to un
derstand why, a few weeks back, an
opinion which I wrote concerning
the Beaubaire - Hearst business
failed to be printed. Vainly do I
reason why, before it went to press,
Mellinkoff's column had to be read
word for word over the tel . phone to
the Hearst-stooge, late Stan Beau
baire.
Ah, now, the cream of the jest, "to
those who took a gentle-bird, it was
all in fun." Words which could have
come only from the pen of one of
the Jacobs ilk. In other words, our
editor simply lacks the guts to at
tack with dignity the corrupt issues
which paralyze the gastric sections
of the student body. (i.e. Miss Ricker
and her staff of culinary thugs and
the fascist measures which force
the girls to eat for four long years
at the residence dining halls, the
Union Cellar prices, the Bookstore
profits, etc., etc.) No! Before Mr.
Jacobs dare say anything along these
lines he must first doff the clown
suit, which enables him, if called to
task, to back water to the tune of,
"I was only foolin'."
Yes, Mr. Jacobs, this is a farewell
and good-riddance to you and the
whole chicken-livered Daily policy
for the school year '34-'35. Put on
your dunce cap and play the buffoon
with your old crony Beaubaire and
remember, before you tear up this
letter and throw it in the waste
basket, that "Nothing Ls so sacred
. . ." even the Razz Edition wal
lowing in its vulgar and disgusting
taste and, remember, "it's all in fun."
