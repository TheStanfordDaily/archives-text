Helmets gleaming in the sun, ]
great bearded men coaxing their !
horses over an untrodden wilderness
. . . heat. . dust . . . death . . . j
that's the heritage of Dennis Cha
vez, who entered the U.S. Senate
Monday, a frontiersman in politics, i
just 337 years after his forefather, j
Juan de Salas, a leader of the Span- |
ish conquistadores in wild New ;
Mexico, started his conquest of a
new world.
Today it's cutaways, cigarettes—!
not shining armor and raw wine, j
but it's a fight just the same for the
47-year-old senator from New Mex- j
ico, who takes the seat of the late :
Bronson Cutting.
On the Stanford campus, one man,
Professor Aurelio Macedonio Es- j
pinosa, is watching. Chavez's con- j
quest of the political frontier with
more than objective interest. Tied j
with the web-like but enduring ;
bonds of tradition are their names j
and families.
Barring the Indians thc-y are rec- |
ognized as descendants from the old
est pure families on the North
American continent. When the I
Spanish army of Ornate was con
quering the desert of what is now |
New Mexico, Marccllo Espinosa and
Captain Juan de Salas fought side
by side. When the Spanish occupa
tion was compleie, the name of
Chavez and Espinosa led in settle- 1

I ment politics. Through the Mexican |
and American occupations, their I
< names have .stood pre-eminent.
More than ancient family friend
! ship, the fact that the De Salas and
Espinosas have been joined in mar
riage makes the senatorial contest a
personal matter to the Stanford
|.savant. Dr. Espinosa's third sister,
; Imelda, is the wife of Dennis Cha
vez. "She is the most beautiful <
woman in Washington today," Dr. j
Espinosa declared. "Chavez, himself, j
i is one of the most progressive of j
New Mexico's political leaders. He j
jis a university graduate and has j
[spent years in state administration.
' I cannot understand the difficulties !
he is encountering in the senate."
, Six Senate liberals walked out of ;
I the Senate Monday, an unprece
dented action, when Chavez was
; named by Governor Clyde Tingley
i of New Mexico as successor to the
; late Bronson Cutting. Chavez' al
-1 leged accusations of irregular voting
| in the original political contest be
j tween himself and Cutting was cited
j as justification.
