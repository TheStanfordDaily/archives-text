# Relief Wages Cut Despite Protests Of Labor Unions
## New Salary Plan Provides Gradual Increase 
### 
WASHINGTON. May 21 (A 1 ). —
Amid storms of labor piotests, the
Administration stood pat today on
a work-relief pay scale sharply cut
ting prevailing rates, but imme
diately projected an adjustment of
wage structure three months hence.
This revision, authoritative of
ficials hastened to explain, does not
foretell necessarily a definite up
ward shift in wage levels newly-set
for most of the $4,000,000,000 pro
gram. Present plans, they said, call
for general increases in monthly pay
rates only if the cost of living
mounts rapidly.
Other quarters insisted in the
three month check-up was part of
original plans and denied vigorously
it represented a concession to the
torrent of labor complaints against
a monthly "earnings" scale heavily
slashing public works administra
tion hourly wage rates.
William Green, president of the
American Federation of Labor, and
Senator McCarran of Nevada, who
led the unsuccessful Senate fight to
require payment of prevailing wages
under the works program, were
among the first to declare war on
the scale set by President Roosevelt.
