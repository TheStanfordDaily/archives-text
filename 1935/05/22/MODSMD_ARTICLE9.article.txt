# HAYPILE FIRES SERIOUS,WARNS ALMON E. ROTH
## Firebugs To Be Expelled; Guards Placed Near University Stacks 
### 
Almon E. Roth, comptroller of the
University, sent the following state
ment to The Stanford Daily last
night:
"The comptroller desires to call
the attention of the student body to
the very serious fire hazard which
is being created by the growing
practice of burning haystacks on the
Stanford campus.
"I think it will be conceded by
everyone that there is nothing very
original or brilliant in this juvenile
stunt, but it is possible that few
realize the danger involved in this
inane practice.
"Last night at least five fires
were started simultaneously on
different parts of the Stanford
campus. The fields are becoming
so dry that there is great danger
that the fire may spread and do
very serious damage. The very
disastrous grass lire which de
stroyed a large portion of the west
erly addition of the city of Ber
keley a few years ago—despite the
combined efforts of the bay cities'
fire departments—is an indication
of the hazard involved in grass
fires.
"Another serious hazard arises
from the fact that when the fire de
partment is responding to these calls,
the University plant and residences
on the campus are inadequately pro
tected, with the possibility of a dis
astrous fire getting started. It is ex
tremely important in handling fires
that the equipment be available at
the fire house.
"Furthermore, the wilful de
struction of property at a time
when the University and the
country generally are facing se
rious financial difficulties, is a sad
commentary on the intelligence
and dependability of Stanford
men. It is not fair to the great
majority of the Stanford student
body, who have always shown a
fine attitude toward the preserva
tion of the University property, to
permit a few individuals to give
the wrong impression of the gen
eral character of Stanford students.
"In order to meet the situation the
University will take the following
steps:
"A sufficient number of watchmen
will be employed to apprehend any
one who wilfully sets fire anywhere
on the Stanford campus. Anyone so
apprehended will be turned over to
the civil authorities for punishment
in accordance with the laws relating
to arson, and the cost of such addi
tional watchmen's service, together
with the cost of the property de
stroyed, will be assessed -igainst such
individuals.
"Any student who wilfully sets
fire, destroys fire protection equip
ment, or turns in false alarms will
be recommended for expulsion
from the University.
"It has been the experience of this
office in the past that Stanford stu
dents will respond and co-operate
with the University in eliminating
any practice, when its objectionable
features are brought to their atten
tion, and it is sincerely hoped that
we will have the co-operation of the
student, body in meeting this prob
lem."
