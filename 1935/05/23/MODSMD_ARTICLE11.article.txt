## Six Campus Singers To Be Featured in Show

Six student-written songs, plus
outstanding campus songsters, will
provide melody for "Follies Bour
geois" on May 31. Mac Gordon, com
poser of Gaieties hits, Las contrib
uted three original songs and one in
collaboration.
Gordon, a combination of song
writer and geologist, has composed
"Who Gives a Darn," "The Ele
mental," in collaboration with
Fred Nagcl, "Governor's Lane,"
and "Just for You."
Manager Dick Frank had planned
at first to use hits from past Gaieties,
but so many tunes were submitted
that it proved unnecessary.
Pete Peck will sing "Who Gives a
Darn," aided by the chorus, and
"Governor's Lane" as a duet with
a woman as yet unselected. "Just
for You" will feature Norman Sears,
backed by the chorus with Janet
Richter in a specialty dance number.
As a climax of the show will be
the "Elemental" number, sung by
Jack Walton and Harriette Hall
Kilby. An "Elemental" dance,
originated by Mrs. Kilby, which
"surpasses the Continental," *v
cording to Dick Frank, will be
performed by George Z. Wilson
and Virginia Rooney.
Barbara Patton, singing star of the
Gaieties, will do one of Nagel's songs.
Jim Copp will contribute more of
his famous "Soliloquies" which
slopped the show before the Big
Game.
