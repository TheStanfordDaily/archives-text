# HOUSE CARRIES VETERANS' BILL OVER F.R. VETO
## $2,200,000 Bonus Measure Faces Almost Certain Death in Senate 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 22 f/P). —
swiftly overriding President Roose
velt's veto warning of "disastrbus
:onsequences," the House today re
mssed the Patman bonus bill and
ent the "new money" plan to an al
nost certain death in the Senate.
Representatives voted 322 to 98
o make the $2,200,000,000 measure
aw over the presidential veto. The
'ote by which the Patman bill passed
he House in March was 318 to 90.
Veto No Avail
The huge majority — many more
han the two-thirds needed—was
•oiled up only minutes after Mr.
Roosevelt personally assailed the
'deceptively easy method" of paper
noney payment before a joint Sen
ite-House session and overflowing
galleries.
This first personally delivered
/eto message of history drew throngs
hat packed the Capitol to over
lowing. But, except for notables
ind their wives, most were forced to
do content with a glimpse of the
chief executive going to and from
he Capitol, and with snatches of
ipplause which echoed through the
corridors.
Despite the almost instantMjieous
House action, the more deliberate
Senate decided to wait until to
morrow, when, at 10 a.m., it will
take up the matter under a rule
limiting time for debate.
Administration forces,* expressing
confidence the bill could be stopped
with the 35 votes they claim have
■food fast during terrific pressure of
he past few weeks, agreed to post
ponement with the understanding
Senators could not speak longer
han 30 minutes. This, however, did
not necessarily mean a vote tomor
row.
Fighting desperately hut appar
ently hopelessly to gain a few votes
after Roosevelt's blunt assertion
th.-U full cash payment represented
'"a new straight gratuity or bounty
to the amount of $1,600,000,000,"
the Patman forces already were
looking ahead to a new drive for
legislation after the final veto
ballot.
