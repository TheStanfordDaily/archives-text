# Detectives To Laugh Last When Indians Burn Hay
## 
### ROBERT EISENBACH 
Once I here were two little fresh
men (or Row men) who had a big
idea. When they were through
studying, and the rc.st of the fellows
were asleep, they slipped out to the
haystacks east of Encina with
matches, cigarette lighters, and
blowtorches. In true Indian spirit,
they padded from haystack to hay
stack until the field was a checker
board of red flame and black night.
Then tlicy laughed and laughed
and laughed, in true Little Aud
rey style. Even Onipus Fire
thief Dugan gargled a giggle.
"eu7. he knew there were eight
special detectives lurking in Che
shadows, and that the Little
Audreys would fare a civil judge
in the morning—charged with ar
son.
The laugh used to be on the Uni
versity, but them days are gone for
ever. From now on, eight special
policemen will guard lhe fields in
«n attempt to break the Farm's most
insistent and vicious tradition.
The detectives went on duty Tues
day night. Since then, there has
been just one call from down En
cina way, Chief Dugan reveals. "It's
no fooling. The cops are real cops,"

|he admonishes. "The arsonist caught
firing a haystack will be taken into
custody facing the sannj charge as if
he had fired a private house, and he
will face court, judgment."
Incidentally, it's not the value of
the hay or the trouble and expense
to the fire department incidental to
these traditional blazes that, has led
Ito drastic control measures. "Insur
ance companies, fire fighters, and in
telligent people generally learned a
valuable lesson from the Berkeley
fire," the chief explains. "That blaze
started in some low brush about
four miles from the nearest house.
Twelve hours later millions of dol
. Jars worth of property had been de
stroyed."
The fact that a similar blaze might
be started on the Stanford campus
by some student bent on sustaining
a so-called tradition, has not been
overlooked.
A fire-setter is never a prank
ster. in the fireman's code, Chief
Dugan maintains. He is always an
arsonist. The Stanfordite con
victed of hay-hurning will stand
the salaries of the detectives who
caught him, and foot a whopping
big fine besides.
i That's one way crime does pay.

day night. Since then, there has
been just one call from down En
cina way, Chief Dugan reveals. "It's
no fooling. The cops are real cops,"

|he admonishes. "The arsonist caught
firing a haystack will be taken into
custody facing the sannj charge as if
he had fired a private house, and he
will face court, judgment."
Incidentally, it's not the value of
the hay or the trouble and expense
to the fire department incidental to
these traditional blazes that, has led
Ito drastic control measures. "Insur
ance companies, fire fighters, and in
telligent people generally learned a
valuable lesson from the Berkeley
fire," the chief explains. "That blaze
started in some low brush about
four miles from the nearest house.
Twelve hours later millions of dol
. Jars worth of property had been de
stroyed."
The fact that a similar blaze might
be started on the Stanford campus
by some student bent on sustaining
a so-called tradition, has not been
overlooked.
A fire-setter is never a prank
ster. in the fireman's code, Chief
Dugan maintains. He is always an
arsonist. The Stanfordite con
victed of hay-hurning will stand
the salaries of the detectives who
caught him, and foot a whopping
big fine besides.
i That's one way crime does pay.
Once I here were two little fresh
men (or Row men) who had a big
idea. When they were through
studying, and the rc.st of the fellows
were asleep, they slipped out to the
haystacks east of Encina with
matches, cigarette lighters, and
blowtorches. In true Indian spirit,
they padded from haystack to hay
stack until the field was a checker
board of red flame and black night.
Then tlicy laughed and laughed
and laughed, in true Little Aud
rey style. Even Onipus Fire
thief Dugan gargled a giggle.
"eu7. he knew there were eight
special detectives lurking in Che
shadows, and that the Little
Audreys would fare a civil judge
in the morning—charged with ar
son.
The laugh used to be on the Uni
versity, but them days are gone for
ever. From now on, eight special
policemen will guard lhe fields in
«n attempt to break the Farm's most
insistent and vicious tradition.
The detectives went on duty Tues
day night. Since then, there has
been just one call from down En
