partment is the latest member
of the faculty to contract the
disease.
If the history of the first wave
repeats itself there should be
a gradual falling off of cases
the rest of this week with an
other outbreak occurring a lit
tle later. All campus dances
for the week-end have been
called off to prevent the catas
trophe of having a large num
ber of students confined during
finals. Though there are bound
to be some cases at thi.s time,
such a preventive measure
should reduce the number.
The epidemic, the worst in
the history of the school, began
the last of April and the peak
of the first wave was reached
when 72 students were in the
Palo Alto Hospital. After a
short slump a new outbreak be
gan, necessitating the reopen
ing of the old Isolation Home.
