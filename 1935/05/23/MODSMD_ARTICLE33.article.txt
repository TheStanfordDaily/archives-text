## Debate Leader Is Named By Masters from Big Application List HOLDS FOUR OFFICES Selection Leaves Vacancy In Ex Committee

The annual New Deal in A.S.S.U.
politics does not stop with the stu
dent body elections. The managers
of the various activities, the back
bone of student administration, are
appointed every year at about this
time.
Backbone of the managers and
kingpin in the A.S.S.U. financial
structure is the student manager. To
this office Bob Gros, debater, holder
of many student offices, and this
year's astute debate manager, was
appointed yesterday by Graduate
Manager A1 Masters.
Many Candidates
Gros got this honor over a field of
many applicants for the position.
Though no official announcement of
tho runners-up was made, rumor in
A.S.S.U. political circles had it that
practically every manager and
leader of A.S.S.U. activities aspired
to the job.
This appointment boosts the.
total of A.S.S.U. positions attained
by Gros to four. He is debate man
ager and a member of Men's Coun
cil, and he was elected graduate
member of Ex Committee in Tues
day's balloting. Gros will resign
from Ex Committee and probably
Men's Council, and next year's de
bate manager will have to be ap
pointed soon by Debate Council.
An estimate of Gros' ability may
be gained from the student man
ager's 1934-35 report, which Ben
Cave will submit to next week's
meeting of Ex Committee. In this
part of the report Cave tersely sums
up tho debating year:
Debate Activities f/vuded
"Debating took on an importance
it never had at Stanford. Operating
under a slightly expanded budget
from last year, Bob Gros succeeded
in organizing Stanford debating on
a nation-wide scale. The eastern
tour was an especial success, four
men making a complete circuit of
the United States, contacting 35 col
leges, speaking to thousands. Too
much cannot, be said for Gros as an
efficient, enterprising manager."
Gros and Bill Rogers won the
Commonwealth Clufi Debate against
California this year.
