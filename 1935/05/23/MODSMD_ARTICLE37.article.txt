# The 						Stanford Cardinals End Their First Year of Existence
## 
### 
Last nielli the first year of an experimental
committee, the Cardinals, caitie to an official
close with the appointment of a new chair
man, new members, as well as Rally Com
mittee chairman, Woman's chairman, and
members of these two committees.
Whatever may be said to the contrary, the
past year has proved that the Cardinals is an
exceedingly workable group, and a distinct
need to campus social life. It has integrated
A.S.S.f. dances into student life, dominated
committee affairs on the Farm, and helped
to give men and women experience in this
type of work, and train them for leadership.
Everything done by the Cardinals this year
lias been experimental, and everything will
set a precedent for future chairmen and for
future committees to follow. There have been
some mistakes, perhaps, but they are far
outweighed by the excellent work accom
plished.
Because the present Daily takes issue with
the opinions of past editors, and believes that
both Rally Committee and Cardinal commit
tee groups are very much needed organiza
tions at Stanford, it takes off its hat to the
work done bv Chairman Kisncr this vear.
