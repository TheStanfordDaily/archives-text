# Don't Let Canceled Dances Get You
## 
### 
Measles scored another disagreeable hl<>\\
to the campus the other day with the calling
oil of the Junior Prom and all other campus
dances scheduled tor this week-end. This
canceling action followed a similar move last
week.
Dr. Storev's recommendation to the stu

dent controlling hoard attended his explana
i lion that the epidemic peaks were two weeks
i apart with the next wave expected during the
: end-quarter finals period. He fell such action
would greatly reduce the number of cases
with the gradual easing oil of numbers toward
the end of the month.
To a campus trying to minimize the serious
ness of the measles epidemic, news of the Ex
Committee's act comes not as a discouraging
and unfair blow but as an intelligent move
to prevent the spread of a measles epidemic
lo uncontrollable bounds and thus to pre
vent the complete isolation of the t'niversitv.
