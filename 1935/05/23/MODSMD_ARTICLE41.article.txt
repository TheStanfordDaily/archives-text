# Nice Things, Courtesy Cards
## 
### 
I he latest revelation in the slate auto mess
which goes under the, name of highway en
forcement, el cetera, concerns the State High
way patrol and its chief, Raymond Cato.
It seems thai there are such things as
"courtesy cards" and that Mr. Cato presents
these to the more select of the people who
drive automobiles in this fair state.
The other day a judge in one of the coast
cities called Mr. Cato's blulT. A man came into
his court for speeding, the second time within
a month, and presented his gilt-edged "card."
The judge promptly confiscated it and sen
tenced the man to jail, at the same time
sharply reprimanding Cato for issuing this
type of card.
Privileges for the few explains the situa
tion, and Cato deserved his reprimand, if the
tacts are true. No matter whether the gov
ernor or the neighborhood dog catcher is
iound speeding, there should be no discrimi
nation because of rank. The important thing
is that both may be jeopardizing human life.
