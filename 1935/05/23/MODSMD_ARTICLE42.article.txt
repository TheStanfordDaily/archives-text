## THE 						LAST FRONTIER: HENDERSON 
### CEDRIC LARSON 
The colonists from Minnesota who have migrated
to Alaska and are settling on government land in the
Matanuska River Valley ju.st north of Anchorage are
among the nation's most fortunate individuals, ac
cording to Lester D. Henderson, forfiier commissioner
of education for Alaska and now district superintend
ent of the Burlingame schools.
Mr. Henderson came to California from Alaska in
1929 after spending 15 years in the land' of the mid
night sun. He is completing work for the degree of
doctor of education in the Stanford School of Educa
tion this quarter.
The concept that Alaska is a frozen waste is an
inaccurate one, and has done much to retard Alaska's
development, Mr. Henderson states, and offers the
following description of the Matanuska Valley:
"The Matwtuska River drains a fertile valley.
It has a beautiful summer climate with sunshine
for almost the entire 24 hours of the day from
May to July, inclusive. Early spring and fall days,
also, are much longer than in the Bay region
latitude. Warmth, richness of soil, nnd absence
of destructive storms make the valley an excel
lent farming area."
The climate during the winter season is a most
agreeable one. While the thermometer may drop as
low as 40 degrees below zero on occasions, the average
for the winter is much above this mark. Wyoming,
Montana, and the Dakotas have a much more l'igorous
winter climate, due to both low temperatures and
blizzards. Low temperatures in this region of Alaska
are seldom or never accompanied by wind. The snow
fall is comparatively light.
Vegetation during the growing season is almost
semitropical in luxuriance. The valley, as well, has
a superabundance of fine timber, has extensive coal
deposits, and salmon fishing flourishes. The prospects
for economic self-sufficiency for the farmers is ex
traordinarily bright.
The government is advancing each family about
$3,000 on which to get started, and the debt may
be amortized over a long period of time. The
greater part of the produce which is raised will be
sold locally in Alaska.
"Go north, young man," the government is saying
to the heads of these depression victim families. Al
though the census showed that the American frontier
of the old West ended about 1890, Alaska is in a sense
the true "last frontier" of the nation, and the atten
tion of the American govei'nment will be increasingly
directed with the passing of each decade to the devel
opment of the great Alaskan storehouse of wealth,
nearly 600,000 square miles in extent.
Mr. Henderson declares that Alaska is capable of
supporting a population a great many times as large
as the present one. The warm Japanese current which
washes the shores of Ihe island-dotted Alaska coast
makes the littoral a mild and scenic region very suit
able for settlement by the white race.
