# OUR HASHER SEZ:
## 
### 
Quite a few of our last outposts of Hellenic culture
initiated their little women into the mysteries of such
neo-platonism as dancing for rushing teas, and the
rites and lefts of the orders.
The total result was that the poor hashers took a
dreadful drubbing on initiation banquets, almost get
ting locked in at 10:30 before they got the dishes
washed (no dirty cracks now, boys).
It seems that at one little shrine among the flowers,
the hashers decided to have a cocktail party in order
to ease their burden. The party was held with remark
able success. Only, one hasher failed to show up.
The result was that the hashing was done with re
markable ease that evening. Plates glided on and off
the table. Trays stacked with dishes moved swiftly
in and out of the room. Bread plates seemed to float
through nebulous ether.
There was only one incident to mar the perfect
evening One gentleman burst into the dining room
with a pay load of coffee just as the ladies had quieted
down for a talk. Confused and embarrassed, the
hasher ducked back into the kitchen, said "My God,
another speech." When the echoes reached the dining
room, many girlish titters were heard. The oddity of
the whole disaster was that this gentleman was the only
one who had not attended the cocktail party.
One of the Row gentlemen of the Roble Auxiliary
desired to hold communication with one of the ladies
of his choice after the telephone exchange had closed
the other evening. So he prevailed upon another lady
friend of his to call up the choice one and say it was>
a long distance call from Washington. D C., which was
the girl's home town. The call came into Hoble on
the emergency phone. All in a dither, the Hoble
executives bustled up to the third floor and hustled the
stricken one out of bed. and hung around the phone
to be the first to catch her or catch on. When the
frightened freshman got the import of the proceedings,
she refused point-blank a request for a date, and
swooned into the waiting arms. Romance!
