# LEVY NAMED FOR PLACE ON I.C.4-A. CARD TRACK TEAM
## Eligibility To Be Ruled On Day Before Meet 
### Warren Breed 
Phil Levy, record - threatening
Card di.scus tosser, will definitely
travel lo Boston to the 1.C.4-A. next
week.
Word was received yesterday
from the Intercollegiate Committee
indicating that Levy's case would
be taken up at a special meeting
May 30, the day preceding the track
fest. Encouraging to Coach Dink
Templeton and his little band of de
fenders was the tone of the letter,
which seemed favorable to the
chances of Levy's eligibility.
The possibility of Levy's enter
ing the meet hosts Stanford's
chances considerably. The big fel
low is one of the more prominent
cinches to lake first place, as his
consistent showings lfiO feet look
better on paper than the work of
!, ny of the eastern discolobi. He
may also sneak in for a place in
tlu> shot.
The rest of the team is still not
decided upon. Humbert Smith, the
high jumper, may possibly make
the grade with a good performance
(his week, but his ankle still keeps
him from the heights he has known.
Dud Sales, A1 Hershey, and Ray
Dean are the other three foremost
competitors for the Boston trip, al
though only two of the last four
mentioned will go. Jim Reynolds,
Sammy Klopstoek, John Mottram,
and now Levy, are four of the six
to go.
Sales, with the 10-foot improve
ment he has exhibited this year, i.s
the most logical of the group to be
chosen. His 209 feet at Fresno, al
though not good enough to place,
may be good enough against the
eastern teams. It will be risky busi
ness, though, for behind Mottram he
will have to deal with Fink and Fitz
gerald of Cal, and it is well known
what the Golden Bear pair can do
with the spear.
There will be 110 formal compe
tition for the tracksters this Sat
urday. although a few of the boys
will travel to Kczar to lake part
in the Junior P.A.A. meet. Anyone
who has not won a big time meet
may enter this competition.
Hunt Kingsbury, hurdler, George
Tharp, broad jumper, and Ed Bur
rows, irosh miler, have signified
their intentions of winning their re
spective events. Their chief compe
tition will come from various junior
college, high school, and club men.

fest. Encouraging to Coach Dink
Templeton and his little band of de
fenders was the tone of the letter,
which seemed favorable to the
chances of Levy's eligibility.
The possibility of Levy's enter
ing the meet hosts Stanford's
chances considerably. The big fel
low is one of the more prominent
cinches to lake first place, as his
consistent showings lfiO feet look
better on paper than the work of
!, ny of the eastern discolobi. He
may also sneak in for a place in
tlu> shot.
The rest of the team is still not
decided upon. Humbert Smith, the
high jumper, may possibly make
the grade with a good performance
(his week, but his ankle still keeps
him from the heights he has known.
Dud Sales, A1 Hershey, and Ray
Dean are the other three foremost
competitors for the Boston trip, al
though only two of the last four
mentioned will go. Jim Reynolds,
Sammy Klopstoek, John Mottram,
and now Levy, are four of the six
to go.
Sales, with the 10-foot improve
ment he has exhibited this year, i.s
the most logical of the group to be
chosen. His 209 feet at Fresno, al
though not good enough to place,
may be good enough against the
eastern teams. It will be risky busi
ness, though, for behind Mottram he
will have to deal with Fink and Fitz
gerald of Cal, and it is well known
what the Golden Bear pair can do
with the spear.
There will be 110 formal compe
tition for the tracksters this Sat
urday. although a few of the boys
will travel to Kczar to lake part
in the Junior P.A.A. meet. Anyone
who has not won a big time meet
may enter this competition.
Hunt Kingsbury, hurdler, George
Tharp, broad jumper, and Ed Bur
rows, irosh miler, have signified
their intentions of winning their re
spective events. Their chief compe
tition will come from various junior
college, high school, and club men.
Phil Levy, record - threatening
Card di.scus tosser, will definitely
travel lo Boston to the 1.C.4-A. next
week.
Word was received yesterday
from the Intercollegiate Committee
indicating that Levy's case would
be taken up at a special meeting
May 30, the day preceding the track
fest. Encouraging to Coach Dink
Templeton and his little band of de
