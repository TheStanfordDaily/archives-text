## OLD ORDER CHANGETH BUT THE GUFF GOES ON 
### 
Yesterday the name D'Evelyn
closed this column for the last time
as sports editor of The Stanford
Daily.
Every few months this strip
changes hands. It's just as regular
as clockwork. And equally as regu
larly columns of wisdom are ad
dressed to the incomer, praise to the
outgoer. To break the old tradition
would be criminal.
But this fellow Mort D'Evelyn,
who's in line for the praise, this
time makes things pretty easy for his
successor. Mort really deserves his
praise. To write it is a cinch.
You see, Mortis one of these
gentlemen who isn't content to sit
over a typewriter all day trying to
think of something new to say. Mort
does things. First of all he held
down a job on Stanford's track
squad, a good afternoon's work for
any man. Mort was no super-track
man. He ran his mile races method
ically, usually too slowly, but he
worked just as hard as any winner.
From Angell Field he would sprint
right over to the Daily shack and
proceed to pound out a yarn. Then
to the Union, where a hashing job
took a good two hours out of every
day. Every 24 hours was a race in
Mort's case.
And the most surprising thing of
allâ€”the grades haven't suffered.
Right now his bawlout proves him
to be too Phi Betish for a conscien
tious sports editor, trackman, or
hasher. But the bawlout doesn't lie.
The sports editing job hasn't been
too easy during these: last few weeks,
either. When the Stanford track
team is limping along with more
than its share of pulled muscles and
the basketball team coming near,
but not quite near enough, to a
championship, there isn't anything
wonderfully sensational to make into
headlines.
Yes, there isn't any disputing the
fact that it's been a tough year so
far for Stanford sports and Stanford
sports editors but Mort D'Evelyn
did his stuff and did it well. -
So ends the usual, but true words,
for spring of 1935.
