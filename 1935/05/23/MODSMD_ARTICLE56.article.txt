# ANOTHER BOWL BID FOR THE INDIAN?
## 
### 
This next sports season takes on a
rosier hue than the one just passed.
Stanford's football machine, with
only two exceptions the same win
ning squad of last year, is already
getting in shape for action in the fall.
Some have even gone so far as to
prophesy another Rose Bowl bid.
And after all, conditions are per
fect for that. When a team has twice

battled its way to play on the Pasa
dena grid, to expect another repeti
tion is not unreasonable.
For two years now Tiny Thorn
hill and the gang of sophomores he
took over in 1933 when Pop Warner
left, have worked together. Together
they have learned how to face ihe
toughest of competition. It was a
hard lesson that day last January
when Alabama passes burned the
air, but Stanford's pass defense will
profit accordingly this season.
There will be plenty of obstacles.
California, U.S.C., Washington, and
all the rest of them plan to make it
plenty uncomfortable for the Indian.
But the old war-scarred tomahawk
wielder should stand up for his
rights next fall, and if he does —
there will be news.
