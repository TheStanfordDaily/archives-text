### 
LOS ANGELES, May 22 (TP). â€”
Jesse Owens, Ohio State's great
negro track star, would be given an '
opportunity to break four world's j
records under plans proposed today
by Coach Dean Cromwell for South
ern California's dual meet with
Middle Westerners here June 15.
Coach Cromwell suggests that the
usual dual meet order of events be
departed from iti order that Owens, j
competing for the first time on the 1
fast Tenth Olympiad track, would !
have a sufficient breathing spell be
tween his favorite contests, the 100
and 220, the low hurdles and the
broad jump.
