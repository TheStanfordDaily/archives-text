# GRID PRACTICE RESUMES WITH COOL WEATHER
## 
### 
Giving his men a rest after the j
few days of terrific heat, Coach Tiny
Thornhill sent them through lim
bering up exercises and then let up j
with a fairly active signal drill in \
yesterday's practice. The heat of j
the past several days has been hard !
on the footballers, and the change
in the weather was a welcome one.
After the warming up session,
the linemen were sent to work on |
the dummies under the direction
of Assistant Coaches Murray Cud
deback and Ernie Hunt. At the â– 
same time Thornhill put his back- |
Held and ends through passing i
practice.
Bobby Grayson, Frank Alustiza, |
Glenn Hamilton, Bill Paulman, Ray
Todd, and Johnny Campbell all tried
their hands at the passing end. Paul- j
man, Hamilton, and Alustiza also |
went through punting work with all J
three booting out long ones. *
