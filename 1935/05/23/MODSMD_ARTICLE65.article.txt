ST. ANNES-ON-THE-SEA. Eng.,
May 22 (/P).—William Lawson Little,
cf Stanford, the defending champion,
and lour sharpshooting Americans
battled their wa} through to the
fourth round of the British Amateur
Golf Championship today over the
sun-drenched Royal Lytham St.
Annes course.
Accompanying the husky title
holder through today's torrid
play were Dick Chapman. Dan R.
Topping, Robert Sweeney, and
Captain A. Bui lock-Webster, who
has made his home in Monterey,
C'al., many years despite his Brit
ish citizenship.
Continuing to shoot even fours for
the second straight day, Little left
no doubt in the minds of any of the
gallery of 3,000, who watched him
dispose of the Lancashire County
giant, J. Zacharias, he'll be hard to
head off in his second quest for the
title. Apparently the broad-shoul
dered American has an affinity for
the 15th green because it was there
he disposed of Eric Martin Smith

' yesterday and Zacharias today—both
by the score of 4 to 3.
The enly thing anybody was argu
ing about tonighr was whether Little
was justified in making one of the
most daring and spectacular shots
ever seen in any championship when
so much as a player's title is at stake.
At the second hole Zacharias' ball
was or the lip of the cup in four,
completely blocking Little's pellet,
which was perhaps 18 inches behind
I in three.
Everybody expected the cham
pion to lay oflf up for a certain
half in fives rather than risk
knocking in his opponent's ball.
Instead, after studying the situa
tion for fully five minutes. Little
calmly called for his mashie nih
lic and chipped over Zacharias'
| ball and landed squarely in the
cup for a winning four.
Little was out in 36 to his rival's
39.
