# Clinchy Names Religion As Cause of Antipathy
## 
### 
All through her history America !
has suffered periodic outbursts of
group antipathy, especially among
groups of differing races and re
ligious beliefs, said Dr. Everett j
Clinchy, director of the National
Conference of Jews and Christians,
in his talk yesterday in the Women's
Clubhouse.
From the very beginning leagues
like the Know-Nothing Party, the
Klu Klux Klan, and others have
arisen because of religious pieju- |
dices. Such a feeling is held even
today as a result of misunderstand- j
ing among these groups. This reflects j
a serious lack in our educational I
system. Dr. Clinchy urges more j
association between Christians and l
Jews, not necessarily, however, for
purposes of worship.
