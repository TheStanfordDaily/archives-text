# CAMPUS OPINION
## IN DEFENSO RAZZ 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Having read Owen Uiph's com
mentary on The Daily's Razz edi
tion which appeared early this
week, I am moved to further dis
cussion of its merits and detri
mental effects.
Students read The Daily every
morning. In it they find sport write
ups, campus news, and articles con
cerning state, national, and interna
tional affairs. In brief, it is a form
of study for the subconscious mind.
We need a diversion from any kind
of study; it is in this wi.y that the
Razz edition served its purpose. It
was a good thing.
Mr. Ulph attacks the neutral pol
icy of The Daily in regard to what
he believes is corruption. Truth
fully, I think his criticism is too
severs and prejudiced to be of any
value. He worked himself into a
heat and made himself a few ene
mies. When he wrote his little
speech he as much as told me that
he didn't know the joy of living.
He didn't bear in mind that there is
little good The Daily can do by
creating a war with the Adminis
tration, or whatever it is he was re
ferring to. He didn't realize that
co-operation would get his cause

farther in the long run. And worse
yet, it probably cost him a few
years off the end of his life for wor- j
lying over the gripe he got out of !
an issue from which he had nothing
lo gain and ever>*hing to lose.
Back to the subject of this year's ;
"chicken-livered Daily staff," I j
might add that the fun of having a
school paper is derived not from j
insulting and trouble-making opin- |
ions and editorials, but from good !
clean upholding of the ideals which I
the name of Stanford implies. After |
all, there Is no excuse for sending a j
paper from this campus to our !
faithful friends and champions who '
might be disillusioned. We should
keep our troubles under our hats |
and smile at onlookers. If we have [
to soothe our pet gripes, let's have I
them out in debates or in some other |
suitable way, but let's do it peace
ably.
We have only a short time left
before we have to shift for ourselves. I
For this reason we should adapt our 1
college routine to make it enjoyable, j
It doesn't need to be "all in fun," j
and it shouldn't be all fun, but a j
farce issue of The Daily once a quar
ter can't harm anyone very much.
Sincerely,
H. B.
