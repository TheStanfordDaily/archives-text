# CIGARETTE CASES

### 
The Editor, Sir:
In recent issues of The Daily we
have read with interest about the
plans being made for the Senior
Ball. Everything seems well con
sidered except that every dancer is
to be given a cigarette case.
No doubt this will be an attrac
tive and well-made souvenir; but
the point is that there are still some
Stanford students (probably a large
number) who do not smoke, and
these would regard a cigarette ease
as a useless gift.
It is my hope that the Senior Ball

Committee can see its way clear to
making some of the red grained
leather into bill-folds and compacts,
instead of imposing cigarette cases
on those who do not want them.
Sincerely,
Richard Rathman, '35
