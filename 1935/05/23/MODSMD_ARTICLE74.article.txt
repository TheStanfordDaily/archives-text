'THE COUNTERFEIT WIFE"
Masquers' reading of the prize
winning play of their recent
contest, Professor Henry David
Gray's "The Counterfeit Wife,"
marked expansion of Masquers' pol
icy to cover the work of Palo Alto
residents and professors, as well as
students.
"The Counterfeit is a fast
moving comedy based upon the re
semblance of twin sisters. The mar
ried twin, meek and mild, is bullied
and oppressed by her husband. The
spinster twin, an attractive social
secretary, as independent as her sis
ter is mild, sets about to make a
balance of domestic rule. Chance al
lows her to take her sister's place
for six months—unknown to the
husband, who is shortly made over
into a docile lamb.
Around this plot are several com
plications which assist the main
story and provide ;«tlditional comedy.
Unlike most amateur plays, this
comedy is free of "gag" and forced
humor. The only weakness, made
apparent by the reading, is a gen
eral weakness in the conclusion of
the play—a bit overdrawn, perhaps.
The readers, very capably directed
by Jean Albertson, drew forth all
the comedy which the play offered.
Annelies Morgan, in the role of the
"counterfeit wife" gave the most
convincing and humorous portrayal
of the evening. As her twin sister,
Fritzi-Beth Bowman provided a
good share of comedy. Tom Sellers,
as the husband, and Sidney Head, as
the "other man," turned in their
usual polished readings. Rosemary
Benet showed versatility in her in
terpretation of the naive young
neighbor.
In smaller roles Frank O'Neill,
George Wilson, Rosemary Sistrom,
and Virginia SwafTord completed the
all-star cast to make a "four star"
reading. Stage directions were read
by James Benet.
