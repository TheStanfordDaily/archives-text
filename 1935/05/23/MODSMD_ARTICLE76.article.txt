# BULL SESSION
## AND ON YOUR LEFT 
### 
It will not be long now. A few
more weeks and the Senior Class
will be swallowed up in the great
blackness that lies beyond the di
ploma. But before the great trek
from the Farm begins, we suggest
1 that seniors, for at least once, visit
the spots that have made Stanford
Stanford and the rough rough.
It is good policy to have a passing
j acquaintance with the more famous
, and infamous loci on the Stanford
| campus. For there are certain to
i be alumni reunions. And when one
i of the inspirited brothers of 00 slaps
! you on the back and yelps: " 'Mem-
I ber that little place the other side
o( the big oak tree," you are duty
bound to do something. And (God
j forbid) if you can't remember the
i "little place the other side of the big
| oak tree," the least you can do is
. offer the brother a drink. And it's
cheaper to remember. Especially
I since Stanford alumni arc prolific.
By all means pay a visit to the
j most deserted building this side of
i the Great Pyramid — the Stanford
! Art Gallery. If you have not seen
I those two giant bovines staring
moodily out of the canvas foliage in
the back room, you have not lived.
| For those two individuals are by all
i odds the most bored animals that
1 ever gave milk. (The artist has his
own vagueness to blame if the crea
tures are bulls.)
And the Felton Library the home
' of the rare, the first, and the unex
purgated editions. A' new adminis
j tration has taken over that sanctum;
! and it is now possible to enter the
place without formal dress. The
; only carpeted floor on the campus.
Yes, there's the Stanford Museum,
the only place on the campus that
j is frankly mummified. A good pigeon
i hole for visiting firemen.
I ———-
After you've seen the Chapel (Yes,
■ Mister, the tile was brought over
I clear from Italy), go backstage in
| the Assembly Hall. Some people

■ wonder why other people take stage
crew. And the only fairly sane ex
planation we have yet heard is that
I in the nooks, the crannies, and clos
j ?ts there is "romance behind the
; footlights." Next to the Cactus Gar
! Jens, we can think of no worse place
i lor romance. But you should see for
f yourself.
If you can graduate from Stan
ford without learning where the
; Hoover home is, or without even
j having misdirected wandering
lowans in search of Mecca, that is
j an achievement. So skip San Juan,
I and visit the Union (often confused
with the Museum), and wind up at
i the Bookstore on the day when re
; bates are paid off, and you will
I never leave Stanford.
