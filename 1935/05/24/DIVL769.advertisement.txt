CUPFUL
OF GASOLINE
SAVED!
You often step on the starter 15
times o day t . . without your motor
really warming up between stops.
Super-Shell can save you up to
a cupful of fuel on each "cold"
start. It warms up 50% faster than
ordinary gasolines.
Super-Shell saves gasoline on
steep hills, too. And on the level
run. Try it. Start cutting the cost of
your around-town driving!
