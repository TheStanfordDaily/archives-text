# SENATE SIDES WITH F.D.R. IN VETO CONTEST
## President Gains Strength In Final Vote After House Rebels NEW FIGHT WILL BEGIN Other Legislation Proposed But Leaders Split 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 23 (/P). —
Siding with President Roosevelt in
his warning of "disastrous conse
quences," a band of 40 senators to
day killed the inflationary Patman
bonus bill—only to find the whole
bonus issue immediately resurrected
on both sides of the Capitol.
Vote to override the chief execu
tive's veto was 54 to 4f). Not only did
this fall short of the necessary tv/o-
IhircLs, but the Patmanites lost in
strength from the original 55 to 33
vote for passage of the $2,200,000,000
new currency measure.
Administration forces mustered
nine votes more than they needed,
despite the overwhelming margin by
which the House yesterday passed
the bi11—322 to 98, in the face of the
President's dramatic personal ap
pearance.
Coughlin Represented
The momentous vote came at the
end of nearly live hours of debate
before; galleries so packed with spec
tators that even senators' wives had
to .sit on the steps in the aisles.
Khaki clad veterans were sprinkled
through the throng and in a promi
nent gallery seat directly facing the
vice-president's dias was Louis
Ward, personal representative of
Rev. Charles E. Coughlin, whose
last night's address condemning the
Roosevelt veto had deluged the Sen
cite with telegrams to override the
President.
Far from conceding themselves
beaten, cash bonus forces immedi
ately .started new moves to oblain
. legislation at this session of Con
gress. Their leaders, however, were
badly divided as to the best course
of strategy.
Rider to Navy Bill
No sooner was the outcome of the
vote announced by Vice-President
Garner, that Senator Clark of Mis
souri. served notive of a motion to
suspend the rules to add a new bonus
bill to the pending $450,000,000 naval
appropriation measure.
Clark's move had only partial
support from the bonus forces.
Others wished to wait and at
tempt to add the Patman hill to
some more vital Administration
measure such as the NRA exten
sion hill or the social sciurity pro
gram.
Before the Senate had voted, the
rncc-defeated Vinson measure,
which calls for full and immediate
cash payment of the bonus, but al
lows more orthodox means of rais
ing the money, was reintroduced in
the House by Representative Fcn
erty of Pennsylvania.

appropriation measure.
Clark's move had only partial
support from the bonus forces.
Others wished to wait and at
tempt to add the Patman hill to
some more vital Administration
measure such as the NRA exten
sion hill or the social sciurity pro
gram.
Before the Senate had voted, the
rncc-defeated Vinson measure,
which calls for full and immediate
cash payment of the bonus, but al
lows more orthodox means of rais
ing the money, was reintroduced in
the House by Representative Fcn
erty of Pennsylvania.
WASHINGTON, May 23 (/P). —
Siding with President Roosevelt in
his warning of "disastrous conse
quences," a band of 40 senators to
day killed the inflationary Patman
bonus bill—only to find the whole
bonus issue immediately resurrected
on both sides of the Capitol.
Vote to override the chief execu
tive's veto was 54 to 4f). Not only did
this fall short of the necessary tv/o-
IhircLs, but the Patmanites lost in
strength from the original 55 to 33
vote for passage of the $2,200,000,000
new currency measure.
Administration forces mustered
nine votes more than they needed,
despite the overwhelming margin by
which the House yesterday passed
the bi11—322 to 98, in the face of the
President's dramatic personal ap
pearance.
Coughlin Represented
The momentous vote came at the
end of nearly live hours of debate
before; galleries so packed with spec
tators that even senators' wives had
to .sit on the steps in the aisles.
Khaki clad veterans were sprinkled
through the throng and in a promi
nent gallery seat directly facing the
vice-president's dias was Louis
Ward, personal representative of
Rev. Charles E. Coughlin, whose
last night's address condemning the
Roosevelt veto had deluged the Sen
cite with telegrams to override the
President.
Far from conceding themselves
beaten, cash bonus forces immedi
ately .started new moves to oblain
. legislation at this session of Con
gress. Their leaders, however, were
badly divided as to the best course
of strategy.
Rider to Navy Bill
No sooner was the outcome of the
vote announced by Vice-President
Garner, that Senator Clark of Mis
souri. served notive of a motion to
suspend the rules to add a new bonus
bill to the pending $450,000,000 naval
appropriation measure.
