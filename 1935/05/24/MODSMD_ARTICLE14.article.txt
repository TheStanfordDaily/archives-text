# Deny Radical Charges At College Convention
## Brooke Refutes Charges Of College Communism 
### 
American college students having
communistic tendencies were laugh
ed down yesterday by the leaders of
more than 50,000 students from 14
western institutions, gathered in
Phoenix, Arizona, for the meeting of
ihe Pacific Students Presidents' As
sociat'on, according to an Asso
ciated Press dispatch.
''Communistic sympathies among
college students arc exceedingly
shallow," said Wally Brooke,
newly elected A.S.S.U. president,
who left for the conference Tues
day night after election results.
"There is a tendency to tear down
and build over many of the divi
sions of government. This is not
communistic, but it is somewhat
socialistic," he .added.
It was the consensus of student
opinion that, except in two or three
hotbeds of student agitation, com
munism has gained no foothold. "Not
one out of 100 college boys will fight
in another war of aggression, or
do battle on foreign soil" was the
expressed opinion of student .spokes
men. In cii.se of an invasion, how
ever, there would be no hesitancy
on the part of college students to
take up arms, they stated—a predic
tion in direct contrast with recent
peace demonstrations in numerous
schools.
David Kendrick, student president
of the University of Idaho, said that
no immediate radical change in the
governmental system will occur, but
with an equally strong conviction,
Ihe capitalistic system in its present
shape will fall.
