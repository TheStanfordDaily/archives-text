# Garden Fete's Proceeds Go To Rest Home
## Receipts from Today's Tea Will Furnish Home 
### 
A new Men's Rest Home to be
rented on the campus will be fur
nished with funds obtained from
the Garden Fete given at the home
of Mrs. Louis Stern in Atherton this
afternoon from 2 to 5 o'clock. As
the number of men in the Rest
Home reached its highest with 216
men cared for winter quarter, the
need for a Rest Home is more press
ing than ever before.
The Stanford Rest Ilomes arc
operated and supported by the
Mothers' Club, at a cost of $2<)o
per month. Each house provides
facilities for the care of eight per
sons at a time. The purpose of
the home is to provide a plurc
where students may rest from
overwork and colds which are not
sufficiently serious to necessitate
going to the hospital.
Since the rest homes were first
organized in 1928, the number of
students taken care of has steadily
increased. It is hoped that it will
eventually be possible for Stanford
to have a permanent infirmary, as is
found in most colleges.
