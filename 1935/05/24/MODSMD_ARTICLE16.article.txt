## Nazis Seek Favor, Accept Britain's Sea Rule 
### 
| BERLIN, May 23 (/P). —A Nazi j
I spokesman today drew a picture of I
|an expectant Rcichsfuehrer Hitler,
! pacing the Chancellory floor and oc-
I casionally glancing at the clock, as
!he awaited word from Britain on I
i suggestions he made in his long j
i Reichstag speech.
! "He has shown the way," said the ,
spokesman. "England can have |
j peace if she wants it."
The Nazis declared one of the
j fundamental objects behind Hitler's
speech was to win back the sym
i of Britain, as they reviewed
! events of the past 48 hours.
To accomplish this feat, they j
| maintained, der Fuehrer leaned j
I backward, assuring the British peo- j
pie in no uncertain terms he has ,
no quarrel with them. His bold i
public recognition of Britain's right j
to dominate the seas and his state- j
rnent ihat Germany would not chal- (
I lenge this right., was looked upon by
j Nazi leaders as an argument power- j
ful enough to win over British I
hearts.
The leaders assert that on all |
points where England is deeply con- j
corned Hitler made concessions in [
such an unprecedented and emphatic |
manner that, the "British govern- ;
ment must grasp Hitler's hand."
