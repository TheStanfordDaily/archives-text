# SIX LOSE LIVES WHEN BOMBER FALLS AT SEA
## Giant Ship Plunges at Night During Mid-Pacific Operations 
### 
HONOLULU, May 23 (/P). â€”Minus
a big bomber which plunged into the
sea and killed six men during spec
tacular night operations, 40 navy
patrol planes presumably were head
ing back here today from Midway
Island, goal of their unprecedented
mass flight of May 9.
Although the fleet command lifted
its news censorship this morning
only long enough to disclose the loss
of the plane and announce the un
precedented sky armada had been
ordered to fly back to Pearl Harbor,
it was learned the planes might be
expected here tomorrow.
Based at Midway
Presumably the 40 planes remain
ing based at Midway, 1323 miles
from here, left there today. They
were destined to stop temporarily at
French Frigate Shoals, 100 miles
east of the little island off which the
tragedy occurred.
The ill-fated bomber was the 6P7.
It feel into the sea Tuesday night 50
miles south of Midway while taking
part in battle operations. The six
men aboard apparently died without
ever realizing what happened.
Secrecy Prevailed
Rigid secrecy veiling the exten
sive operations involving scores of
battle planes and fighting surface
craft was lifted quickly at the first
hint, of the tragedy. Warships, which
had been operating in darkness,
turned on their powerful search
lights in a hunt for the fallen craft
but it never was seen.
Officers then ordered the Midway
planes back to their Pearl Harbor
base.
At the same time, naval authorities
here disclosed the flagship Pennsyl
vania would move into Pearl Harbor
Saturday morning, leading the
other 165 ships taking part in the
far-flung operations.
The movement to Honolulu will
constitute an attempt of the entire
United States fleet to anchor at once
in the harbor here.
Crashed with Force
Tlie 6P7 apparently crashed with
terrific force in full flight while cir
cling about a disabled sister plane,
the 6PIO, which had been forced
down on the ocean surface and was
leaking.
The only wreckage found by the
cruiser Northampton, the first sur
face vessel to reach the crash scene
50 miles south of Midway Island,
was a battered gasoline tank, a
twisted wing tip and a seat cushion.
Officers on the Pennsylvania said
that news of the crash was withheld
until a 24-hour search by air and
surface craft had convinced them
the six men had been killed and
their bodies lost.
