# Nelson Eddy, Concert Singer, Interviewed by Daily Reporter
## 
### DOROTHY NEWMAN 
(Editor's Note: The following is
;\n interview witli Nelson Eddy,
well-known opera, concert, and
motion picture star.)
"Hotel St. Francis."
Interview starts, like a model T
going up a hill: "Er-a-em—could I
speak with the secretary of Mr. Nrl-
M>n Eddy, please?"
Long silence. Finally operator re
turns. "What is his name?"
Interviewer gulps: "I'm sure I
don't know." (Oil)
Another long, long silence. Then a
man's voice (wh.it a voice!) "Hello."
Interviewer inhales deeply, I—2—
and begins attack:
Mr. Eddy Speaks
"Pardon me, but I'm speaking for
ihe daily paper of Stanford Univer
sity. I wonder if you can tell me
how long Mr. Eddy will be in the
city."
"This is Mr. Eddy speaking." (You
can fool some of the people!) "I'm
leaving San Francisco thus evening."
"Well—cr—Mr.—Eddy, I hope I
didn't get you out of bed."
Mr. Eddy replies something to the
effect that he has been disturbed.
Interviewer gulps inanely. More
apologies.
"Well, I suppose you'll be very

tuuriy iiiuu—
"Yes, I will be."
"Well, I wonder if you could or
—spare about five minutes at any
time at all during the day—cr—that
is—"
"I'm afraid I II bo extremely busy. I
Just what was it you wished to
speak to me about?"
Interview Painless
"Well—er, I don't exactly know—
but I haven't much to s;iy—er—it'll
be quite painless. You sec, I don't
know much about interviewing.
Well, anyway (renewed vigor) I
wonder it you could donate a few
minutes of your time to an article
for the Stanford Daily."
"I don't know when I could pos
sibly see you. Supposing we hold
the interview right now over the
telephone."
"All right. That'll be fine." (Of all
rotten things! No notes—no pencil—
no questions—and no tact!)
Well, anyway, after a few more
gulps and a couple of shivvers. the
interview (?) begins. In her com
pletely dislodged state of mind, it is
uncanny that the interviewer re
membered as much as she did of
what occurred in those ten long
minutes.

lias Studied Extensively
Mr. Eddy has studied under a
dozen teachers during his training
for a singing career, his present in
structor being Dr. Lippe.
Yes, he enjoyed his role in
I "Naughty Marietta" extremely, and
intends making more pictures
! shortly, along with his other work,
which includes opera, concert, and
ladio appearances.
Mr. Eddy emphasizes the practical
side of a wincing career. He himself
worked on a newspaper while study
ing voice culture at night, and
doesn't hesitate to give this same
; dvice to like aspirants for stage
glory. 'Art' may be a wonderful
thing, but. after all, it's nice to have
a roof over your head, and some
clothes to put on your back while
preparing for a career. "Even if i*'s
just standing behind a counter, sell
ing ties, take it," advises Mr. Eddy,
"rather than accept endowments
from willing contributor;;."
Most people, he stated, want to
accomplish too quickly what will
take, at a minimum, ten years. He
has been studying for 15, and con
tinues his lessons, realizing that in
the singing field there is never a
| completion to the training required.
