"Don't Be a Quidder, Be a
Bidder," is the song and dance
of Venerable Cuckoo Gordon
Steedman of the Chappie staff
announcing the frothcoming
"Quid" issue for Thursday,
June fi.
Up in the quietness of the
Chappie office, where nothing
is heard these days hut the
sound of the bird, those cute
little printers' devils are as
sembling cute little pictures of
Stanford figures. Steedman
says: "These are not off-collar
pictures, but that's no sign peo
ple can buy Chappies on the
cuff."
"Last issue of Chappie sold
out because of student interest
in Hie "Love" number." This
one will be the 'Life' issue. And
one little vowel isn't going to
make a whale of a difference."
"Why buy a Quad for five
bucks, when you can get all the
hope for only 15 cents plus one
penny for Frankie and John
ny?"
