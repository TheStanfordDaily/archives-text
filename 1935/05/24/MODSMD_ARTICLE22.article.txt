# A.F.L THREATENS GENERAL STRIKE
## NRA Extension Demanded By Green, Labor Head 
### 
NEW YORK, May 23 (/P). —A na- j
tion-wide general strike was threat- j
ened tonight by William Green, j
president of the American Federa- j
tion of Labor, unless Congress ex- j
tends the NRA for two years and
passes the Wagner labor disputes bill |
and the Black-Connery 30-hour a'
week bill. j
Addressing nearly 50,000 members |
of the federation, gathered inside j
and outside Madison Square Gar
den in a mass demonstration, Green |
also threatened political retaliation '
against members of Congress.
'"We will refuse to work and will
mobilize our entire economic
strength until we get our rights," 1
he said as the vast, crowd roared its '
approval.
'"That is no idie statement. I mean
just what I say. Furthermore, the
workers can mobilize our political
strength and order those men who
deny us to stay at home when they
stand for re-election."
Seventy-three thousand of the
workers crowded into the Garden
itself, the others thronged in the
streets outside, taxing the efforts of
several hundred policemen.
Green appealed to labor to follow
the lead of President Roosevelt and
struck at the recent statement of for
mer President Hoover demanding a
speedy death for the rational re
covery act.
"As for labor, we will follow Roo
sevelt and not Hoover."
