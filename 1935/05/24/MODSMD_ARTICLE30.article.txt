# The 						Senate Goes to Bat for Roosevelt
## 
### 
The most absurd spectacle of "pressure"
legislation that has passed before tins country
in many years finally lel I llat on its lace yes
terday on the Senate floor bv a decisive vote.
In what will probably turn out to be a
historic move President Koosevelt appeared
before Congress yesterday, and lirinlv and
courageously gave his reasons for vetoing the
Pat man bonus hill.
Three hundred and twenty-two Congress
men, so-called representatives of the people,
overrode the President's veto with deafening
cheers. Paced with thousands of telegrams,
tremendous pressure from their constituents,
ami the prospect of losing their jobs, the
House of Representatives was a pitiful spec
tacle as it allowed itself to become nursemaid
to a self-pitying class.
Lucky il was that the Senate still retains
enough of. a majority of clear-headed older
men, who could see straight with the Presi
dent, and realize the danger of a bill which
would lead to payment by inflationary meth
ods, by printing money. It was fortunate that
they could see the danger of passing legis
lation for one special group, who would im
mediately become "privileged," when there
are millions of others in this country at the
present time who need assistance just as much
as litis veteran class, which grows ever more
rest less.
Kvery day it becomes more apparent that
politics in this country are becoming more
and more blatantly rotten. The Huey Longs
and their type of hokum-spreading politicians
are in the saddle and they like the glowing
feeling of adulation which the average "Lib
erty"-reading Americans shower upon them.
The latest example of Washington law
making is nothing but an eyesore. A bit more
respect.for the President earnestly attempting
to carry out his policies, even though they
may not be infallible, might help to avert a
serious national crisis within the next few
months. There is another election next year.
Put while Roosevelt is still President, the co
operation of Congress might still be a valuable
asset to the country, although that august
bodv itself does not seem fullv to realize this.
