East with the Cardinal 1.C.4-A. team is the
excellent suggestion put forth hy E. H. in to
tlay's Campus Opinion column.
While the 15-A.C. will no doubt save money
and he able to send one more man to the
meet hy sending the Indians under the wing

when the national competition is considered;
and sending Ellington might be repaid several
hundred per cent in points, in good will, and
in future contacts for Stanford.
