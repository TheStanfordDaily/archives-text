# A
						Most Serious Man
## 
### 
The most serious man in the world Ikis been
found. He is an opera singer in Italy, Ban
dini by name. The other day, during a per
lormance of "Lucia," this tenor proved his
earnestness in a most convincing manner.
During the last part of the opera, Handini
plunged a dagger into his breast. Hospital
reports are that the tenor is in a "serious"
condition. It can be seen that the man had
not a grain of levity in his system.
