### CEDRIC LARSON 
When far-reaching changes are proposed to an
antiquated social economy the extremist shouts: "Do
it toda>!" the stand-patter cries: "Never!" and the
moderate utter a cautions: "Soon, but not now."
Dean Grayson N. Kefauver of the School of Educa
tion sees in the rapidly shifting economic sands of the
present day a distinct challenge to educational leader
ship. The educator, whether his station be a humble
or important once, faces a serious responsibility in
shaping the correct attitudes in his students toward
the direction in which society is moving.
"Educational leadership is concerned with fa
cilitating change and with giving direction to thai
change," declares Dr. Kefauver. "Facilitating and
giving direction to change requires that the leader
make a judgment as to the go nl toward which he
will move. The more rapid and the more basic
the changes ii» society, the more important it is
(bat forward-looking leadership be provided for
the educational program."
A long-time view is essential because of the evo
lutionary character of social change. "There have
been few sudden fundamental revolutions in the his
tory of civilization and each has been preceded by a
long series of developments which brought about the
crisis and the resulting shift of conditions," states the
educator.
There are many forces that the forward-looking
educator must combat. Minority and pressure groups,
each with its own special interest to grind, interfere
oftentimes seriously with progressive education, and
hamper schools through unsound legislation and im
possible demands.
The progressive schoolman must work to build
"a public opinion strong enough to withstand the
interferences of individuals and groups." Very often
minority groups exert more influence upon the
school system than the community as a whole,
paradoxical as it may seem. Here again the need
for uncompromising educational leadership is es
sential.
Nor does Dr. Kefauver overlook factors which
inhere in the profession of teaching itself which block
the way of social advancement, for he recognizes:
"The teachers themselves may constitute an obstacle
to educational change. They may have understanding
and loyalty to outmoded educational practices. Some
educational changes may affect the positions of in
dividuals, so that personal interests of individuals may
disturb the support of new ventures."
The greatest menace of all, however, to improved
methods of directing the attention of the young toward
an improved social order is found in the very "com
placence of the person who is supposed to exercise
leadership, his failure to acquaint himself wilh con
ditions and trends in society, and his failure to define
future educational goals toward which he will strive."
"The need of educating for the future can
scarcely be ovcrstressed," believes (lie Stanford
educator. The tempo of life is constantly accel
erating. Changes are greater in scope and com
plexity, and the future will be more radically dif
ferent from today than l!)i>s is from the remote
past.
It is customary to talk about "a plane of stability"
or "a plateau of calm" following the sweeping changes
that have enveloped human society in the past cen
tury, but all the evidence, on the other band, points
to an ever increasing change, more swift and funda
mental in effect, with the passing of each year, without
any stationary period. This means that a larger and
larger portion of culture will be modified in time
to come.
"Conservatives seem to experience severe emotional
disturbance when it is suggested that education should
look to the future and that an effort should be made to
define the future," remarks Dean Kefauver.
Although no educator would attempt to present
his student with a photographic picture of life 50 years
hence, he can and must clearly arid fearlessly discuss
trends and processes with his scholars, "so as to stimu
late their critical and intelligent interest in the direc
tion in which society is moving. Silence here is synony
mous with negligence.

"The need of educating for the future can
scarcely be ovcrstressed," believes (lie Stanford
educator. The tempo of life is constantly accel

past.
It is customary to talk about "a plane of stability"
or "a plateau of calm" following the sweeping changes
that have enveloped human society in the past cen
tury, but all the evidence, on the other band, points
to an ever increasing change, more swift and funda
mental in effect, with the passing of each year, without
any stationary period. This means that a larger and
larger portion of culture will be modified in time
to come.
"Conservatives seem to experience severe emotional
disturbance when it is suggested that education should
look to the future and that an effort should be made to

Although no educator would attempt to present
his student with a photographic picture of life 50 years
hence, he can and must clearly arid fearlessly discuss
trends and processes with his scholars, "so as to stimu

Dean Grayson N. Kefauver of the School of Educa
tion sees in the rapidly shifting economic sands of the
present day a distinct challenge to educational leader
ship. The educator, whether his station be a humble
or important once, faces a serious responsibility in
shaping the correct attitudes in his students toward
the direction in which society is moving.
"Educational leadership is concerned with fa
cilitating change and with giving direction to thai
change," declares Dr. Kefauver. "Facilitating and
giving direction to change requires that the leader
make a judgment as to the go nl toward which he
will move. The more rapid and the more basic
the changes ii» society, the more important it is
(bat forward-looking leadership be provided for
the educational program."
A long-time view is essential because of the evo
lutionary character of social change. "There have
been few sudden fundamental revolutions in the his
tory of civilization and each has been preceded by a
long series of developments which brought about the
crisis and the resulting shift of conditions," states the
educator.
There are many forces that the forward-looking
educator must combat. Minority and pressure groups,
each with its own special interest to grind, interfere
oftentimes seriously with progressive education, and
hamper schools through unsound legislation and im
possible demands.
The progressive schoolman must work to build
"a public opinion strong enough to withstand the
interferences of individuals and groups." Very often
minority groups exert more influence upon the
school system than the community as a whole,
paradoxical as it may seem. Here again the need
for uncompromising educational leadership is es
sential.
Nor does Dr. Kefauver overlook factors which
inhere in the profession of teaching itself which block
the way of social advancement, for he recognizes:
"The teachers themselves may constitute an obstacle
to educational change. They may have understanding
and loyalty to outmoded educational practices. Some
educational changes may affect the positions of in
dividuals, so that personal interests of individuals may
disturb the support of new ventures."
The greatest menace of all, however, to improved
methods of directing the attention of the young toward
an improved social order is found in the very "com
placence of the person who is supposed to exercise
leadership, his failure to acquaint himself wilh con
ditions and trends in society, and his failure to define
future educational goals toward which he will strive."
