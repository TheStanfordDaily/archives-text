The galloping measles have the hospital attendants
not only galloping but jittery. One of our old estab
lished campus love matches was recently rudely dis
rupted. when the male partner was stricken during a
Sunday night supper. The lady rushed him down to
the measles-ward. True devotion lasted throughout
the siege. Not only did she take all her class notes
on carbon paper, but she showered milkshakes, books,
and flowers upon the lad. One day during the height
of the epidemic the lady found the hospital attendants
too busy to convey the milkshake to the impounded
invalid, so she wandered around underneath the win
dow, where a bathrobe hoisted a milkshake up to
waiting hands.
This was entirely too much for the neurotic hospi
tal supervisor, already nervous about the many spent
beer bottles littering hospital lawns. So she d;ushed up
to the room, sniffled over the whole place, was greatly
chagrincd to find nothing more incriminating than the
vibrated juice of the cow.
If you think these haystacks have the University
worried you should see the poor laddies at the fire
house who have to interrupt studies and sleep to go
out and put down the blazes. The over-worked boys
just about broke down : n hysterics the other day when
one of the firemen kidded the rest of the gents with,
the story that some old nasties had planned on turn
ing in an alarm, and then while the trucks were gone,
they would cart over a load of hay and set it on fit
in the fire house.
The third big epidemic that is the companion to the
measles and the haystacks is the big strawberry epi
demic. Every spring when strawberries get cheap, the
Chinese cooks lay it on the table just about every day.
A delegation of the Gamma Phi's waited upon thÂ»ir
son of Heaven, informing him that they were getting
damn tired of all the strawberries. After an hour or
so of impressive ceremonies, the thought finally clicked
on the gustatory chief. "All lighty,' he said, "Havurn
stlawbellv svrrupp now."
