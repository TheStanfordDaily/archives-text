"TOBACCO ROAD"
At the Curran Theater
Most playwrights attempt to por
tray a perfect world and we go to
see their plays to laugh and cry and
live as most of us never can in our
own routine existences. In vi
cariously experiencing the full lives
of the heroes we undergo a mental
catharsis and emerge with bright
ened perception and a satisfied out
look.
"Tobacco Road" reverses this for
mula and shows us an unbelievable
class of people, the "po" v/hite tiash"
of our South—ambitionless, charac
terless degenerates. And yet, it at
tains the same end as the "perfect"
play, for one emerges purged and
thankful for his own little world.
Erskine Caldwell and Jack Kirk
land have written a good play, but
also havje been clever enough to add
enough obscenity and filth to make
it a popular box office attraction.
So, if one wishes, he may enjoy a
couple hours of salacious entertain
ment and, in rationalizing, say, "a
wonderful class study, such charac
terizations! such acting!"
And, individual performances are
unusual. Various members of the
cast take their roles .so convincingly
that one says, "I wonder if he or
she is really like that?" Henry Hull
plays the leading role of Jeetsr
Lester with rare artistry. His tech
nique is made up of the combination
of perfect poise and the use of stud
ied,. detailed pantomime. This is
true of most of the cast. Helene Hill
as Grandma Lester goes through
the entire show without speaking a
line, and yet. gives a vital and pow
erful characterization.
John Arledge plays the son who
marries the preacher woman, twice
his age, just, to get an automobile
horn to toot. He lent a certain wild
insanity to his acting which gave
the part tremendous vitality. Pearl,
the beautiful, near-moronic daugh
ter, brings this same madness to
her role in a quieter way. It's more
in the distracted look of fear in her
eyes—as of an imprisoned wild rab
bit. Mary Servos does brilliant work
as the Mother, in whose life every
thing is crushed by the degenerate
existence of Tobacco Road—every
thing except the love for her daugh
ter. However, even thta love isn't
pure and admirable, but if more like
the reaching of a child, in infantile
darkness, toward a bright bauble.
