"RECKLESS"
At the Stanford Theater
Based on the Libby Holman Rey
nolds headline episode of a few
years ago, "Reckless" gives Jean
Harlow, the screen's noted platinum
blonde, still another chance to show
i her basic talents (which, after all,

constitute her
chief claim to
fame). A me
diocre actress,
she is shown at
tempting to sing
and dance. But
don't, blame the
rendition of the

: songs on Jean. They were obviously
| sung by another, afterwards "dub
| bed" in. So was much of the danc
ing. Bill Powell is there with his
usual "comedy-in-the-face-of-trag
tdy" wise cracks, but they sound
better when directed to Myrna Loy
ior Ginger Rogers. "Reckless" will
be liked by Harlow fans; for the
rest of us it's no better, 110 worse,
I than her previous film fare.
