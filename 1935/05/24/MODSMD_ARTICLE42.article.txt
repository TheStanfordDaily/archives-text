# Jane Addams' Funeral Marked by Simplicity
## 
### 
CHICAGO, May 23 (/P).â€” The sim
ple sincerity that marked the lil'e
time of Jane Addams predominated
today as the world paid its final
tribute to "the Angel of Hull House."
In Bowen Hall of the settlement
she founded and made world fa
mous in Chicago's ghetto district,
mourners passed the bier at the rate
of a thousand an hour to pay their
last respects to the widely known
social and peace worker.
