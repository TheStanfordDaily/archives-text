# PHI BETE HOUSE MOUSE ROUSES BROWSE HOUSE
## 
### 
A woe, cowering, timorous
heastie just about upset the
equilibrium of Chaunccy's soft
think parlor l/vst night, when
u field mouse got loose and de
stroyed all reserve in the Re
served Book Room of the Li
brary.
The screams of women and
tiie pitter-patter of little feet
scared the wits out of students
pounding the hooks for today's
exes. lien Dey, Koblc hasher
and a hit of a tennis player,
came to the rescue of the
frightened females, picking up
the mouse by the tail and car
rying it kick'rng and struggling
from the room.
