## 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 23 (/P).â€”
Abandoning all hope for enactment
of the Patrnan bonus bill at this
session of Congress, John Alferi, "the
one-man bonus army," is on his way
back to Los Angeles.
Alferi, who has "beaten his way"
across the country five times in
hopes of seeing the Patman bill made
law, promised before departing to
return in 1936.
It v/as Alferi who created a dis
turbance last January 4 when he
shouted at President Roosevelt from
the Capitol steps, "We want our
bonus." Arrested, he was released
after being escorted to the District
line. He returned immediately.
