# CAMPUS OPINION
## H.B. JUST AN ILL WIND 
### 
Tlie Editor, Sir:
Sage and serene-like, reeking with
Elbert Hubbardish temperance,
H. 8., in his patronizing tone, tried
to make himself appear the gentle
breeze following the storm, but to
rne he was just an ill wind.
He would have Mr. Ulph cultivate
a refined indifference, if indifference
can be refined, toward obvious cam
pus evils. "Keep our troubles under
our hats and smile at onlookers,"
says he. Maybe he is thinking of the
"Comic Spirit," although I could
never feel that it was particularly
comic to be robbed at every turn —
Union, Bookstore, Theater (5 per
cent), etc. . . .
H. B. advises Ulph to be less se
vere and less "prejudiced" if he
wants his criticisms to be of value.
Any one but an H.B. can see how
much Bookstore rebate Mellinkoff
has gotten us by less severe and
less "prejudiced" methods. Maybe
H.B. can tell us how far a "peace
able debate" will lower campus food
prices.
H.B. says Ulph knows "nothing of
the joy of living," (why don't you go
up and see him sometime?) but, he
does know one thing H.B.'s don't
know, that life begins the day we
are born, not the day we graduate.
Drool on, H. 8.; if indifference is
bliss, may you die of joy.
