# "ULPH DOESN'T DROOL"
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
The mere signature "Ulph" on a
campus opinion seems to be enough
to start a storm of protest regard
less of what he says. Why is it that
while most of the students feel that
the Union is no more than a gyp
joint and that to eat at Encina is to
die either of indigestion or starva
tion, depending on whether or not
you can down the food,
the minute that Ulph writes it a
wave of letters opposing it (most of
them signed with initials) appeal's.
Ulph may gripe, but at least he
doesn't drool, and the extolling of
"good clean upholding of the ideals
which the name of Stanford implied"
in H.B.'s letter is drool and nothing
else. Presumably the "neutral pol
icy of The Daily" as regards the
meals situation represents the up
holding of an ideal. What, then are
the ideals of Stanford?
Is weak-kneed non-resistance to
every evil that confronts as (sparing
ourselves and those none too clearly
defined "friends and champions of

Stanford" from the horrible danger
of being "disillusioned") to be con
strued as a Stanford "ideal"?
Did Stanford model its ideals after
Pollyana?
If so, then The Daily is living up
to Stanford's ideals in their highest
sense but for God's sake give us
Ulph.
Sincerely,
Philip Chamberlin
