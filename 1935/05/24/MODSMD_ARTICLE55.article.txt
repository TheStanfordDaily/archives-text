# BULL SESSION
## FILM FUN 
### 
When the silver screen was very
young (i.e., before it could talk),
there were great hopes held out for
the pictorial infant: It would civilize
the uncivilized world, and educate
the civilized world. It would bring
the glories of the stage within the
x - each of every lowa farmer. It
would stimulate and uplift the Great
American Mind. Next to Sloan's
Horse Liniment, nothing was ever
so widely hailed as the advent of
moving pictures.
But the color was not yet in its
cheeks, sound had not yet broken
from its lips before it became hor
ribly apparent that the cinematic
child was in no way related to its
legitimate forbears. From the un
holy union of Drama and Business
has come forth an idiot child bab
bling with all the coarse fluency of
the funnypapers, the Saturday Eve
ning Post, and the city streets. Far
from being a leader in the march
toward enlightenment, the new the
ater proved itself a ready follower
in the well-worn ruts of the common
taste. Sound films—far from im
proving matters—merely carried the
movies' burden of trash to the il-

I literate and the blind. Motion pic
| tures of real merit were (and are)

I lost in a sea of photographic tripe.
| In recent years and months there
! have been some efforts made to im
prove the Cc/libre of the average
i motion picture. The Motion Picture
| Research Council (which Dr. Wilbur
now heads) has worked in that di
j rection. Various of the more en
. lightened critics have pointed the
way. But the plain fact stands that
i movies are still rather terrible. A |
! complacent public and a kept press I
! have not improved matters. "Time,"
I "Rob Wagner's Script," and occa-
I sionally The Daily are among the

i truth about the cinema.
Sadly, the average theater-goer i.s
I satisfied with the average picture.

thing better have never bothered
i sufficiently to make their protests

As long as the movie i.s dependent
I upon box office receipts, the only

disapproval of bad shows is to boy- |
j cott the box office. Stanford—which i

When the silver screen was very
young (i.e., before it could talk),
there were great hopes held out for
the pictorial infant: It would civilize
the uncivilized world, and educate
the civilized world. It would bring
the glories of the stage within the
x - each of every lowa farmer. It
would stimulate and uplift the Great
American Mind. Next to Sloan's
Horse Liniment, nothing was ever
so widely hailed as the advent of
moving pictures.
But the color was not yet in its
cheeks, sound had not yet broken
from its lips before it became hor
ribly apparent that the cinematic
child was in no way related to its
legitimate forbears. From the un
holy union of Drama and Business
has come forth an idiot child bab
bling with all the coarse fluency of
the funnypapers, the Saturday Eve
ning Post, and the city streets. Far
from being a leader in the march
toward enlightenment, the new the
ater proved itself a ready follower
in the well-worn ruts of the common
taste. Sound films—far from im
proving matters—merely carried the
movies' burden of trash to the il-

I literate and the blind. Motion pic
| tures of real merit were (and are)

I lost in a sea of photographic tripe.
| In recent years and months there
! have been some efforts made to im
prove the Cc/libre of the average
i motion picture. The Motion Picture
| Research Council (which Dr. Wilbur
now heads) has worked in that di
j rection. Various of the more en
. lightened critics have pointed the
way. But the plain fact stands that
i movies are still rather terrible. A |
! complacent public and a kept press I

I sionally The Daily are among the

I satisfied with the average picture.

thing better have never bothered
