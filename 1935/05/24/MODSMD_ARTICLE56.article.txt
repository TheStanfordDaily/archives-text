# WHY NOT ELLINGTON
## 
### 
The Editor, Six-
Brutus Hamilton is a great guy
and an excellent track coach, but
why can't the B.A.C. trust a Stan
ford man with the charge of our
diminutive I.C.A.A.A.A. squad?
If "Dink" Tcmpleton is unable to
make the trip, his capable assistant
Bill Ellington has never yet been
found lacking 011 those cold and
windy days this winter, and other
winters too, when trudging around
Angell Field beating a modicum of
ability into a lackadaisical crew of
would-be athletes could be con
strued as something less than the
pleasantest job in the world.
Ellington has always been ready
when needed; why can't he go East
if Templeton does not?
