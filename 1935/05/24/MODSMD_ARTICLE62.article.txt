# PLAN COURSES IN SHAKESPEARE FOR SUMMER SESSION
## Large Faculty Will Direct Drama Classes 
### Dorothy Ames 
Keeping time with the general re
vival of interest in Shakespeare on
the Pacific Coast, a sort of Malvern
festival with special courses in
Shakespearean direction and pro
duction will feature Stanford's 1935
Summer School session.
For the first time, a'professional
actor, William Thornton, former
Stanford man, has been engaged
to teach in summer session. Dr.
Margery Bailey will head the
Shakespearean School and will
conduct courses in the study of
his plays for acting and produc
tion.
Also on the staff, teaching tech
nical direction, will be Orville Gold
ner, who designed the setting of
"King Kong" and "Lost World" and
is art director of the San Diego Ex
position. James Sandoe, '34, has re
cently come from Columbia to assist
in teaching courses on Shakespear
ean production and Tudor life and
customs.
The principal idea of this school
will be to show how Shakespeare's
plays may be presented simply and
inexpensively without losing any of
their color and drama. The empha
sis will be on the dramatic power of
the productions and not upon their
physical ornamentation.
The University of California and
the Pasadena Community Playhouse
are also participating in this Shake
spearean revival.
