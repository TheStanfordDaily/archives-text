LOS ANGELES, May 23 (£»).—A
46-year-old woman tried her best
today to marry her fiance before he
died, but the Episcopal minister
called in to perform the ceremony
declined to do so because each of
the couple had been divorced. Nor
would a nearby fire station send a
pulmotor to keep the man alive until
a Methodist minister could arrive.
So the man, W. D. Corcoran, 46,
succumbed to pneumonia just be
fore a police automobile bringing the
Methodist minister skidded to a stop
outside. Mrs. Leona Hubbard, the
fiancee, wept bitterly.
