# LITTLE ADVANCES TO QUARTERFINALS BY TWO VICTORIES
## Only Two Americans Left In British Tourney 
### 
ST. ANNE'S-ON-THE-SEA. Eng
land, May 23 (/P). —The American
menace in the British amateur golf
championship was diminished in
man-power in today's gale-swept
fourth and fifth rounds, leaving Wil
liam Lawson Little, Jr., of Stanford,
the title-holder, and Robert Sween
ey, formerly of New York, to carry
the Stars and Stripes into tomorrow's
quarter-finals against six British
rivals.

A pair of invaders from the United
States—Richard M. (Dick) Chap
man and Dan R. Topping, both of
Greenwich, Conn. — survived the
morning session, but fell before the
straight-shooting sons of John Bull
in the afternoon, and joined Captain
A. Webster-Bullock of Monterey,
Cal., who was blasted out of the
running in the fourth round.
Little, who has no liking for
sweeping breezes and lightning fast
greens, disposed of a pair of locj
favorites, making 11. («. McCallum
of Troon, Scotland, on the hack
nine and then beating out the
tenacious little James S. Black on
the home green in the afternoon.
A stiff wind, barren fairways and
suicidal, slippery green have taken
the small toll of his game as others,
but it looks like the burly Califor
nian still has any amateur's number
in the clutch. In both matches today
his opponents, who were almost sol
idly backed by rampaging galleries
numbering 5000, held him even go
ing out along the railroad tracks,
but his extra distance off the tees
finally got them pressing on the cru
cial holes and wrapped them up in
disaster.
Long Drives
In his match against McCallum,
who carried Johnny Goodman an
extra hole in the 1934 tournament,
Little twice belted drives that cov
ered more than 330 yards. His tee
shot landed in the rough hole high
on the 337-yard tenth, which he
followed up with a 12-foot put for a
birdie three, and three holes later
he poled one 335 yards on the front
of the thirteenth green, although he
flubbed his approach arid lost the
hole, to go onfe down.

Greenwich, Conn. — survived the
morning session, but fell before the
straight-shooting sons of John Bull
in the afternoon, and joined Captain
A. Webster-Bullock of Monterey,
Cal., who was blasted out of the
running in the fourth round.
Little, who has no liking for
sweeping breezes and lightning fast
greens, disposed of a pair of locj
favorites, making 11. («. McCallum
of Troon, Scotland, on the hack
nine and then beating out the
tenacious little James S. Black on
the home green in the afternoon.
A stiff wind, barren fairways and
suicidal, slippery green have taken
the small toll of his game as others,
but it looks like the burly Califor
nian still has any amateur's number
in the clutch. In both matches today
his opponents, who were almost sol
idly backed by rampaging galleries
numbering 5000, held him even go
ing out along the railroad tracks,
but his extra distance off the tees
finally got them pressing on the cru
cial holes and wrapped them up in
disaster.
Long Drives
In his match against McCallum,
who carried Johnny Goodman an
extra hole in the 1934 tournament,
Little twice belted drives that cov
ered more than 330 yards. His tee
shot landed in the rough hole high
on the 337-yard tenth, which he
followed up with a 12-foot put for a
birdie three, and three holes later
he poled one 335 yards on the front
of the thirteenth green, although he
flubbed his approach arid lost the
hole, to go onfe down.
