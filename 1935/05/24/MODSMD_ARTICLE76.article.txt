# TRACKSTERS WILL COMPETE IN P.A.A. MEET TOMORROW
## Burrows, Tharp, Kingsbury To Travel to Kezar 
### 
While the majority of Stanford's
trackmen take a rest after five weeks
of continuous competition, several
will take part in the Junior P.A.A.
meet at Kezar Stadium in San Fran
cisco tomorrow afternoon.
Ed Burrows, George Tharp, and
Hunt Kingsbury are three who will
invade the Park with blue ribbon
intent. Burrows took a fifth in the
regular P.A. meet a month ago, and
is figured to be a little too much for
the various jayseo and prep men
who will face him.
Tharp, who has so far been unable
to hit his J.C. form in the broad
jump, is due to reach out into his
&ld class at around 23 feet G inches.
A sore heel kept him from hitting
the take-cifT properly in previous
meets, but the defect has left and
George is looking for happy leaping.
Kingsbury will probably enter
both hurdles, and has a good chance
of copping honors in both. At the
Intercollegiates he was clocked, in
fifth place, at 14.5, a time four
tenth;; of a second below the record.
He has been working out daily with
Sammy Klopstock on Angel 1 Field
and is never more lhan a few yards
astern.
After the junior P.A. tomorrow
and the 1.C.4-A. a week hence,
trackmen will be through for the
season, except for those who are
entered in the N.C.A.A. at Berkeley
at the end of June.
