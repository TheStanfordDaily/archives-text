If the board feels thut it can af
ford to send Sales, Stanford will
have another man in the 1.C.4-A.
field. Dink personally wants to send
Dud; the whole matter is a finan
cial one now.
Phil Levy's eligibility to throw the
discus is still hanging in air, the de
cision not to be rendered by the
1.C.4-A. committee until the day be
fore the meet, which is scheduled for
May 31 and June 1.

positive that he would not accom
pany the team, chosing to favor his
health, and trust the radio to bring
him news of his team's accomplish
ments. Manager Low Foster also
was asked to make the trip, decided
to remain at home. "Too many
back papers to write," Low reasoned.

admittedly small but when Klop

perhaps Sales are strong in their
respective fields. Those events en
tered at all are ably entered.
