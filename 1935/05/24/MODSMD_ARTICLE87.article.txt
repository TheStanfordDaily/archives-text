Angell Field . . . rebuilding . . .
B.A.C. meeting . . . words that
have been used in these columns so
often lately they're becoming trite,
must once again be put in print,
but for the last time this quarter,
be assured.
Here and now we lower the boom
on the Angell Field controversy un
til next fall. Here and now we re
view the set-up as its rests today.
Last Sunday evening the B.A.C.
wis to bring up the measure at
their monthly meeting, probably
to pass it and assure an eager
campus that the ancient Angell
Field would be rebuilt before next
track season. Hut nothing was
done.
Wednesday evening the Finance
Committee was slated to discuss the
measure in regard to the estimate
of $23,000 submitted as the prob
able cost of rebuilding the track
and turfing the infield. Still nothing
was done.
Now from Graduate Manager Al
Masters' office comes the report that
the next B.A.C. meeting, formerly
scheduled for June 17, will prob
ably be rescheduled for June 3, 5,
or 6 in order that student members
of the board might attend before de
parting homeward for summer
days.
For (he third time the re
build Angell Field proposition is
slated to be given a hearing. They
say that three's •< charm. At any
rate there will be no putting the
matter off this time. There will
have to be action, either for or
against, and if Masters' words of
a few days ago are born out it
will be "for."
There will be another supporter
for the cause if that next meeting
h set. for the sth or fith. Sammy
Klopstock will return from 1.C.4-A.
competition at Boston about that
time and has been asked to sit in
on session as newly elected student
member with the three old student
representatives, Jim Triolo, Marvie

Kahn, and Stan Anderson.
Sammy won't have any vote bu
his power of debate will probably

about the past of Stanford athletic,
than any other ten men arouni
these parts, has unearthed some c.ib

Angell Field was called the "fastes

Harry remembers a day in 1909
when Dad Moulton, lirst Stanford
track coach, supervised the build

"First they laid layer of straw
and then crushed brick," Maloney
reminisced, "and then they sent

Maloney went on. "Those wen
