Stanford Outstanding
Stanford has always been out
standing in water polo play on the
coast, ur.d since the West coast
usually dominates the national situ
ation it is only right to say, th-
Indians have been standouts in ihe
country as a whole.
In the last 22 years of water
polo play in the Pacific Coast Con
ference, Stanford has won the
drynpionship 21 times. In addi
tion, during the past three years
of the existence of the Northern
California Water Polo Association,
which is composed of athletic
clubs as well as colleges, the Red
skin paddlers have taken the
championship each year.
Coach Nort Thornton has devel
oped an entirely new offense for
next year's team. Taking into the
swimming tank as much as possible,
a diversified basketball style of at
tack, Coach Thornton will be intro
ducing an innovation to the water
sport. The varsity has been work
ing with the new system for the p;ust
few weeks, and it appears to work
successfully.
Next Season Promising
Stanford's material for next sea
son is outstanding. After seven
weeks of work with the team, Coach
Thornton is not yet certain of his
first team. Co-eaptains Bill Wood
ard and Wally Wiget, both chosen
all-Coast last season, appear to have
twa of the guard posts cinched, but
there is a three-way fight for the
other between Don Peterson, Suds
Sutherland, and Bill Hanna.
Bob Ilaslacher seems to have
the goal position well in hand, but
the situation at the forward posi
tions is far from settled. Bill
Clerno, Boh Hoover, and Chuck
Gillin now rate a slight edge over
Jack Loupe, Boh Eticnnc, and Ben
Voss, but the posts are not cinched
; as yet.

When the interclass games are
completed, the squad will have a
rest until autumn quarter, when the
real practice will begin. In todayV
games seniors will meet the fresh
men at 4:30 o'clock in the varsity
pool.

tions is far from settled. Bill
Clerno, Boh Hoover, and Chuck
Gillin now rate a slight edge over
Jack Loupe, Boh Eticnnc, and Ben
Voss, but the posts are not cinched
; as yet.

When the interclass games are
completed, the squad will have a
rest until autumn quarter, when the
real practice will begin. In todayV
games seniors will meet the fresh
men at 4:30 o'clock in the varsity
pool.
Completing a spring practice pe
riod of seven weeks' duration, the
varsity water polo squad, now aug
mented by last season's freshman
team, will meet starting tomorrow in
a series of interclass games tu decide
the University champ.
Not only will the squad be com
pleting the spring practice session,
but it will be ju.st starting work in
an undertaking which is planned io
carry it into the 15)3(5 Olympic-
Games as the representative of the
United States. There is now but
one more year before the next
Games, and next season's play will
decide the representative to be
chosen.

Stanford Outstanding
Stanford has always been out
standing in water polo play on the
coast, ur.d since the West coast
usually dominates the national situ
ation it is only right to say, th-
Indians have been standouts in ihe
country as a whole.
In the last 22 years of water
polo play in the Pacific Coast Con
ference, Stanford has won the
drynpionship 21 times. In addi
tion, during the past three years
of the existence of the Northern
California Water Polo Association,
which is composed of athletic
clubs as well as colleges, the Red
skin paddlers have taken the
championship each year.
Coach Nort Thornton has devel
oped an entirely new offense for
next year's team. Taking into the
swimming tank as much as possible,
a diversified basketball style of at
tack, Coach Thornton will be intro
ducing an innovation to the water
sport. The varsity has been work
ing with the new system for the p;ust
few weeks, and it appears to work
successfully.
Next Season Promising
Stanford's material for next sea
son is outstanding. After seven
weeks of work with the team, Coach
Thornton is not yet certain of his
first team. Co-eaptains Bill Wood
ard and Wally Wiget, both chosen
all-Coast last season, appear to have
twa of the guard posts cinched, but
there is a three-way fight for the
other between Don Peterson, Suds
Sutherland, and Bill Hanna.
Bob Ilaslacher seems to have
the goal position well in hand, but
the situation at the forward posi
tions is far from settled. Bill
Clerno, Boh Hoover, and Chuck
Gillin now rate a slight edge over
Jack Loupe, Boh Eticnnc, and Ben
Voss, but the posts are not cinched
; as yet.
