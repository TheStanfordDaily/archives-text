# Dr. Willis Writes Study on Central African Geology
## 
### SALLIE TABER 
Dr. Builey Willis of the Stanford ;
geology department, who in 1929 |
several months studying the j
Rift valleys in Africa, has finished j
writing up his work and it is to be t
published by the Carnegie Institu- j
tion of Washington.
"In hunting down the earthquake J

dragon," said Dr. Willis, "I was led
to Central Africa, where there are
great lakes whose bottoms are sunk
under sea level and a wonderful
mountain under the equator which
carrics glaciers in its summit.
Interesting to Geologists
"It is the region of the great Rift

valleys which for t.he past 50 years
have been objects of interest and J
wonder to geologists. Many theories j
have been spun to account for them. |
It has been thought that the val- |
leys were arches in the earth's crust j
and that the keystones had fallen
in. They have been described as j
great rents as if Africa had been :
torn apart, and it has been said the
split reached from South Africa to j
tho Jordan Valley in Syria."
Explains Rift Valleys
Dr. Willis does not think, how- j
ever, that arches or rents in the !
earth's crust explain the Rift val- !
leys, but concludes that there is a j
great molten mass under East Af- [
rica which has raised part of the j
continent and drawn down sur- i
rounding sections as troughs or val- j
leys. 1 1
