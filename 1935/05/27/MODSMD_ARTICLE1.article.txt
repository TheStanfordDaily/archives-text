TACOMA, Wash., May 2G (A i ). —
Three more days to live!
That was the cold-blooded warn
ing facing federal, state, and city
gunmen and sleuths today as they
continued the greatest man hunt ;n
Ihe history of the Pacific Northwest
for the kidnapers of 9-year-old
George Weyerhaeuser.
A ransom note demanding $200,000
gave the boy's father, J. P. Weyer
haeuser, Washington and Minnesota
timber magnate, five days to raise
the money —"or else." Upon the
back of the envelope was scrawled
the youth's signature.
Second Day Ends
Today was the end of the second
day, and no concrete clues or evi
dence appeared to have been un
covered.
Meanwhile the anxious and grief
stricken parents awaited new in
structions, the G. men of the United
Slates Department of Justice, stand
ing aside as far as guarding the
home, telephone lines and mails were
concerned, to give them a chance to
contact the abductors.
They did not want to jeopardize
the boy's life. The note had read,
in part: "A slip will mean a slip."
Following orders contained in the
lengthy ransom note, which was re
ported as saying the "job" had been
planned for three years, the Weyer
hausers inserted two personals in a
Seattle newspaper. The first read:
"Expect to be ready to come
Monday. Answer, Percy Minnie."
Then the second:
"Due publicity beyond our control,
please indicate another method of
reaching you. Hurry relieve an
guished mother. Percy Minnie."
Family Await Call
And today Mr. and Mrs. Weyer
haeuser waited in their palatial
home, overlooking Commencement
Bay here, for another special deliv
ery letter or a telephone call.
It was understood they were ready
to pay the nearly quarter of a mil
lion dollars for the safe return of
their child.
Although officially tight-lipped on
the case, the authorities were known
to be carefully checking the move
ments of all .auspicious characters
within a radius of 100 miles of
Tacoma.
