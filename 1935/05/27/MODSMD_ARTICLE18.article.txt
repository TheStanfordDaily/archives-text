### 
LOS ANGELES, May 20 (/P). â€”
Royal M. Robertson, leader of a pro
posed second bonus march on Wash
ington, today marshaled his forces
for what he promised would be a
trek of 1000 to 1500 World War vet
erans to the capital via San Francis.
A crowd of veterans, still debating
advisability of the march, gathered
early at. the headquarters staked
out by Robertson, who was one of
the leaders of the ill fated bonus
march of three years ago.
Robertson asserted that his forces
will get to San Francisco by hopping
rides on freight, trains, in automo
biles or on foot if necessary, and
that from there the movement oast
ward will start in earnest.
Sharp disapproval of Smedley
Butler, former marine general,
failed to deter Robertson in his
plans.
Robertson, however, said that
"satisfactory action by the right
parties" would lead him to call of!
the march.
