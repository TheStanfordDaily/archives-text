# Senior Endowment Fund Swells; Drive Pressed
## 
### 
Pledges amounting to $250 have
been received already for the en
dowment which the senior class is
planning to leave. Members of the
Endowment Committee, under
Chnirman Gordon Mallatratt, are
canvassing seniors for pledges,
which may be made for any amount
and may cover any period of time.
Cards for pledges may also be se
cured at the A.S.S.U. offices, and
the pledges may be left there.
The money will be placed in a
lasting scholarship fund which will
go on from year to year as the
pledges are paid. Thoy are not
binding, and the graduate has the
privilege of increasing or decreas
ing the amount from year to year
as desired.
