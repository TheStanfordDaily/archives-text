# NRA CHAMPIONS PUN STRATEGY
## Senate Filibuster Looms For Extension Bill 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 26 (/!'). —A
couple of aces in the l.ole—which
they frankly would prefer not to
use—were talked of today by con
gressional strategists who seek to
enact President Roosevelt's two
year NRA extension plan.
Only a Senate filibuster threaten
ing to delay final action beyond
June 16, the day the recovery law
expires, would bring either stra
tegical move into play. But prelim
inary signs of such a filibuster were
plentiful.
If it develops, leaders said two
things could be done:
The House could retreat from its
present stand for a two-year exten
sion and accept any bill agreeable to
the Senate, even one extending the
NRA only 9M> months. Then an
other measure making the changes
desired by Donald R. Richberg and
Mr. Roosevelt could be put into the
legislative mill.
The second alternative would be
for the President, by proclamation
under existing law, to extend pres
ent codes until August 16 in the hope
that an amendatory measure would
ben enacted by then.
Informal talks on the situation
continued today. Democratic leaders
of the House Ways and Means Com
mittee drafted a tentative resolu
tion for submission to the full com
mittee tomorrow. That measure
then would be taken up and passed
by the House Tuesday.
