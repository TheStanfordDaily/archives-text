# Measles Cases Drop To Thirteen Over Week-end
## 
### 
A big drop in the number of
measles cases over the week-end
leaves only ten in the Isolation Hos
pital and but three in the Palo Alto
institution. This is the lowest ebb
reached in the second wave of ihe
epidemic and only one new case was
admitted yesterday.
In spite of the slump, authorities
believe that there will be a new
outbreak of cases at the end of this
week or the first of next. The can
cellation of campus dances that has
taken place the past two weeks will,
however, tend to reduce the num
ber, they point out.
