# Little First Yankee To Take Briton Title Twice in Succession
## Defending Champion Beats Dr. Tweddell, One Up, In Final Round MATCH HARD FOUGHT Early Rounds Are Harder Than Those Won Last Year 
### M Jack Newman 
Another triumph for Stanford was
I scored last week-end when Lawson
! Little, holder of both British and
American amateur golf champion
j ships, scored a one-up victory over
Dr. William Tweddell to become the
, first American to win the British
; title two years in a row. The match,
! which was played at St. Anne's-on
i the-Sea, England, made Little the
third man to win the title two years
| in succession.
Little's victory came with greater
I effort this year than last. For one
| thing, his one-hole victory in the
j finals over the British doctor came
| less easily than his spectacular win
j over James Wallace, the Scottish
Carpenter, who opposed him in last
j year's finals. Also his earlier rounds
were harder, especially the one 19-
i hole match that he was forced to
; win last year to annex the title.
Wins Hard-Fought
His wins in the last tournament's
j early rounds were much more la
: barious than in the amateur com
-1 pleted last Saturday, though the
I final round pressed him to a greater
I extent. The early victories were less
| difficult. In the semi-finals round
Little won a victory over Robert.
I Sweeney, the lone American reach
| ing that round with him, by a 2 to 1
' margin. In the quarter final match
he overcame his rival by a four and
; three margin.
| It was on the third day of the tour
| nament that his fellow Americans
| worried most about the possibilities
! of his winning the second title in
j succession. In the first match of that
day he managed to subdue H. G.
j McCullum on the back nine after the
| Briton gave him a stiff battle at the
| first. In the second round of the day
jhe won victory over tenacious
! JameS Black of Troon, on the home
i green.
Close Margins
In the third round he won over
the Lancashire County giant, T.
Zacharias, by a margin of 4 and 3.
In the second round he won over
' former Amateur Champion Eric
I Martin Smith by a margin of 4 and 3.
Little started out with a good lead
! in his 36-hole match with the Briton
but dropped several holes when he
j was seized with an attack of the
j jitters and saw his earlier advantage
' wiped out on the thirtieth hole.
Regains Poise
He regained his poise sufficiently
to win two of the next three holes
and marched to the thirty-fifth dor
mie two. Here the Briton lopped a
hole off his deficit and he almost,
holed out spectacularly from the
trap for a birdie three, but won from
a four as Little rapped an iron sec
ond into a swarm of spectators in
the rough and produced a five. The
marshals held up the last hole for
10 minutes until the cheering for
the courageous Briton had calmed.
I On the last hole Little holed out
| for a four to tie the hole and win the
I match by a one-hole margin.

Wins Hard-Fought
His wins in the last tournament's
j early rounds were much more la
: barious than in the amateur com
-1 pleted last Saturday, though the
I final round pressed him to a greater
I extent. The early victories were less
| difficult. In the semi-finals round
Little won a victory over Robert.
I Sweeney, the lone American reach
| ing that round with him, by a 2 to 1
' margin. In the quarter final match
he overcame his rival by a four and
; three margin.
| It was on the third day of the tour
| nament that his fellow Americans
| worried most about the possibilities
! of his winning the second title in
j succession. In the first match of that
day he managed to subdue H. G.
j McCullum on the back nine after the
| Briton gave him a stiff battle at the
| first. In the second round of the day
jhe won victory over tenacious
! JameS Black of Troon, on the home
i green.
Close Margins
In the third round he won over
the Lancashire County giant, T.
Zacharias, by a margin of 4 and 3.
In the second round he won over
' former Amateur Champion Eric
I Martin Smith by a margin of 4 and 3.
Little started out with a good lead
! in his 36-hole match with the Briton
but dropped several holes when he
j was seized with an attack of the
j jitters and saw his earlier advantage
' wiped out on the thirtieth hole.
Regains Poise
He regained his poise sufficiently
to win two of the next three holes
and marched to the thirty-fifth dor
mie two. Here the Briton lopped a
hole off his deficit and he almost,
holed out spectacularly from the
trap for a birdie three, but won from
a four as Little rapped an iron sec
ond into a swarm of spectators in
the rough and produced a five. The
marshals held up the last hole for
10 minutes until the cheering for
the courageous Briton had calmed.
I On the last hole Little holed out
| for a four to tie the hole and win the
I match by a one-hole margin.
Another triumph for Stanford was
I scored last week-end when Lawson
! Little, holder of both British and
American amateur golf champion
j ships, scored a one-up victory over
Dr. William Tweddell to become the
, first American to win the British
; title two years in a row. The match,
! which was played at St. Anne's-on
i the-Sea, England, made Little the
third man to win the title two years
| in succession.
Little's victory came with greater
I effort this year than last. For one
| thing, his one-hole victory in the
j finals over the British doctor came
| less easily than his spectacular win
j over James Wallace, the Scottish
Carpenter, who opposed him in last
j year's finals. Also his earlier rounds
were harder, especially the one 19-
i hole match that he was forced to
; win last year to annex the title.
