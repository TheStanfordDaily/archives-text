# Janitor's Building-How About the Janitors?
## 
### 
Plans art* being spoken of for the erection
nf new janitors' quarters for the building of
a *30,(MM) structure to house janitors who
work in the dormitories on the Farm.
A new building is an excellent idea. The
present shacks are make-shift eyesores and
very poor housing substitutes for people to
live in throughout the year.
However to go ahead with a new building
:it once is vaguely suggestive of trying to cure
;i man's headache by aplying curatives to his
lower extremities. There is a very trying
problem at Stanford the janitor problem
and to go ahead with any external remedies is
not going to remedy functional disturbances
to the slightest degree.
The system of hiring janitors is poor. The
men employed are poorâ€”and the services
lliey render to the University is nothing to be
complimentary about.
The janitorial efril is a very real one. Men
are hired without particular reference to their
background, capabilities, or any recommenda
tions. They arc set free on the quad to do their
work, allowed leeway in the dormitories to
clean up and 'administer tlve given service.
In most cases the employees are satisfactory.
Hut there are many instances where these
janitors revert to inclinations they have
learned elsewhere, and ;is a result, students
may be "out" watches, razors, money, and
many other articles.
And so, a new janitors' building may be a
very line idea. Hut why not first a complete
and exhaustive investigation into the janitor
system on the Farm, reorganization where it
is needed? Then, a new building and perhaps
higher pay might induce a new type of janitor
ial employee something badly needed right
now.
