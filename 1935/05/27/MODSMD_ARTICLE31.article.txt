In 1 s lias been belittled and laughed ;il down :it
Phoenix, Arizona, where the meeting of the
Pacific Students Presidents' Association has
heen held. As W'ally Brooke, Stanford's en
voy, aptly put it, "Communistic sympathies
among college students are exceedingly
shallo ,\
Communism only has hold on the campuses
if Bed-baiters consider that a handful of per
sons constitute that "hold." The presidents
have indicated, however, :i realization that
there is a tendency to tear down and build
over many of the divisions of government.
Such a tendency is called socialistic instead
of communistic. Kit her terminology, how
ever, is incorrect and inadequate.
This tearing down and rebuilding of govern
ment is called thi' "Scientific attitude" in Citi
zenship courses. II is a result of the unsettled
and "open" condition of the mind.
This experimental attitude, however, is not
restricted to communism. It encompasses all
the "isms." Hearst and the other Bed-baiters
usually fail to realize this fact or else over
look it.
