## TWO DANGER SPOTS: CUBBISON 
### CEDRIC LARSON 
With 40 million men in uniform throughout the
world, and a irenzied race for armament taking place
among all major powers, the dove of peace seems to
have little prospect of settling down in peace over
civilization in the near future.
Lieutenant Colonel Donald C. Cubbison, professor
of military science and tactics, sees two distinct men
aces to the future peace of America: the Philippines,
and the threat of another European conflagration.
The Philippines, where the colonel spent many years
in army service, is a source of danger unrecognized by
most persons. Now that the new constitution has been
adopted by a five to one vote by the islanders, the
officer believes that America's relinquishment of con
trol over these islands should be final.
The break with the Spanish-American War island
heritage of the Far East should be clean cutâ€”no
guardianship, protectorate, or other strings binding the
United States to play future great uncle to ten million
brown men in time of peril.
"The Hawaiian Islands must be the future Pacific
frontier of America,'' declares Colonel Cubbison, "for
I do not believe that there are interests in the Far East
sufficient to warrant an armed conflict there between
United States and any Asiatic power."
If any other nation should seize the Philippines in
the future, it must not be the concern of America to
intervene, for Philippine independence must be com
plete and the world given to understand so.
A rock which threatens the peaceful course of the
United States is the vexatious European situation. In
this stormy, peninsular-like continent, a causus belli
seems to lurk behind every hedge, so to say. The
merest spark might engender a blaze overnight. A
small, highly-mechanized force may decide the issues
of the coming conflict before the general population
realizes what has taken place.
What America must do, the colonel believes, is to
outline a definite statement of strict neutrality to
which the nation will commit itself. Some points in
such a code might be the refusal to lend money to
belligerents, to sell no war supplies to warring nations,
to make fighting countries come to American shores
for purchases which would only be made on a cash
basis, or forbid Americans to go abroad in times of
war. These would be only a few of the far-reaching
steps necessary to preserve strict independence.
Asia, Prince Metternich of Austria once remarked,
begins on Vienna's Landstrasse. True it is that a mil
lenium of surging of barbaric Asiatic tribesmen up
the Danube had left the ancient Reich of the Hohen
staufens of motley racial complexion at the beginning
of the twentieth century. '
Germans, Magyars, Czechs and Slovaks, Poles,
Serbs and Croatians, Ruthernians, Rumanians, Slo
venes, and Italians make up the racial hodge-podge of
central Europe, where the World War was born, and
where the "incident" for the next war may well arise.
America must preserve its independence at all costs
and irrespective of the course of European events,
the Unitd States must defend if necessary its treasures
from foreign cupidity, but give up all thought of being
lured into a coalition or alliance.
