SIN IN COLLEGE
Could it be possible that those doipgs of American
college students which come under the vague but
branding classification of sin are fading away in the
advance of American culture? It could, and it is. But
one must not be misled by the fact.
Fifteen years ago several thousand students in six
American colleges were somewhat astounded. They
were asked to list their versions of sin, starting with
the worst and proceeding to the one they considered
most minor. Here is the 1920 student's idea of what
is sinful:
Sex irregularity, stealing, cheating, lying, drinking,
gambling, vulgar talk, Sabbath breaking, swearing,
gossip, selfishness, idleness, snobbishness, extrava
gance, smoking, dancing.
This list came from both men and women, and the
correlation was practically perfect on all counts except
gossip, a point on which the females proved squeamish
by placing it in tenth position.
When the research was done, moralists and preach
ers voiced their bland approval. Only Bertrand Russell
caused a sour note by announcing that evidently col
lege students considered sex irregularity worse than
murder since the former was at the top of the list.
Now comes a second list of sins—ls years after:
Sex irregularity, stealing, cheating, gambling, lying,
drinking, selfishness, snobbishness.
Evidently vulgar talk. Sabbath breaking, swearing,
gossip, idleness, extravagance, smoking, and dancing
have emerged into the light in the minds of the youth
ful group. But why? Therein truly lies a problem
for those who pass judgment on ethics. And can they
prove that in another 15 years the list won't be com
pletely purged?
The modern roll-call of sins is not far wrong in
most students' minds. Dancing and smoking need not a
word of defense. Extravagance, considered in terms
of money, can hardly be a sin since it affects no one
but the person doing (he spending, and it probably
affects him in a very satisfying manner. Idleness is
the rule rather than the exception in these days, col
lege days not expected. Voluntary idleness might be
mildly sinful, but it is hard to get anyone to admit it.
Gossip and swearing probably escape the modern
list chiefly because they lack what every valid sin
should possess—evil intent. Since the modern Student
as a rule doesn't know how to keep the Sabbath, he
cannot be expected to be able to keep from breaking
it. And vulgar talk, though impossible to defend, can
hardly be condemned in such drastic terms as "sinful."
Thus it is possible that those doings of American
college students which come tinder the vague but
branding classification of sin are fading away in
advance of American culture. But the only reason for
this is that as the students' list of condemnations is
gradually narrowed, the doings are removed from
the pale.

as a rule doesn't know how to keep the Sabbath, he
cannot be expected to be able to keep from breaking
it. And vulgar talk, though impossible to defend, can
hardly be condemned in such drastic terms as "sinful."
Thus it is possible that those doings of American
college students which come tinder the vague but
branding classification of sin are fading away in
advance of American culture. But the only reason for
this is that as the students' list of condemnations is
gradually narrowed, the doings are removed from
the pale.
SIN IN COLLEGE
Could it be possible that those doipgs of American
college students which come under the vague but
branding classification of sin are fading away in the
advance of American culture? It could, and it is. But
one must not be misled by the fact.
Fifteen years ago several thousand students in six
American colleges were somewhat astounded. They
were asked to list their versions of sin, starting with
the worst and proceeding to the one they considered
most minor. Here is the 1920 student's idea of what
is sinful:
Sex irregularity, stealing, cheating, lying, drinking,
gambling, vulgar talk, Sabbath breaking, swearing,
gossip, selfishness, idleness, snobbishness, extrava
gance, smoking, dancing.
This list came from both men and women, and the
correlation was practically perfect on all counts except
gossip, a point on which the females proved squeamish
by placing it in tenth position.
When the research was done, moralists and preach
ers voiced their bland approval. Only Bertrand Russell
caused a sour note by announcing that evidently col
lege students considered sex irregularity worse than
murder since the former was at the top of the list.
Now comes a second list of sins—ls years after:
Sex irregularity, stealing, cheating, gambling, lying,
drinking, selfishness, snobbishness.
Evidently vulgar talk. Sabbath breaking, swearing,
gossip, idleness, extravagance, smoking, and dancing
have emerged into the light in the minds of the youth
ful group. But why? Therein truly lies a problem
for those who pass judgment on ethics. And can they
prove that in another 15 years the list won't be com
pletely purged?
The modern roll-call of sins is not far wrong in
most students' minds. Dancing and smoking need not a
word of defense. Extravagance, considered in terms
of money, can hardly be a sin since it affects no one
but the person doing (he spending, and it probably
affects him in a very satisfying manner. Idleness is
the rule rather than the exception in these days, col
lege days not expected. Voluntary idleness might be
mildly sinful, but it is hard to get anyone to admit it.
Gossip and swearing probably escape the modern
list chiefly because they lack what every valid sin
should possess—evil intent. Since the modern Student
as a rule doesn't know how to keep the Sabbath, he
cannot be expected to be able to keep from breaking
it. And vulgar talk, though impossible to defend, can
hardly be condemned in such drastic terms as "sinful."
