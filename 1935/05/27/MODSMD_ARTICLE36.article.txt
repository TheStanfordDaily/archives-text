"BOTH YOUR HOUSES"
At the Community Theater
Tlie Community Players produc
tion of "Both Your Houses," political
satire of our government, takes
place in the offices and
committee rooms of the Aporopria
tions Committee, where a huge leg
islative bill is being considered. The
characters of the play are various
politicians and office holders, ex
acting roles which the cast splen
didly portrayed.
Ralph Welles, director of the pro
duction, has done one of hi.s best
jobs to date with "Both Your
Houses." For the play is one that
could easily have become "draggy"
and heavy, but Welles succeeded in
keeping the lengthy round-table
discussion interesting by clever Stage
groupings and attention to panto
mimic detail. Too, the use of the
specially constructed revolving stage
made the six scene changes instan
taneous, proving that a little in
genuity will often take the place of
lavish expenditure.
Maxwell Anderson, prominent
Stanford alumnus, has written an
outstanding play in "Both Your
Houses." Its principal theme is the
corruption and graft which surround
our government and which has been
there so long that even honest men
have come to think it necessary. The
author prophesies the turning of
the "American public worm" and a
complete political change if the men
in control don't change fhst. But, he
concludes with the truism that "the
resources of American political ap
athy haven't yet been touched" and
that the much needed change will
probably not be in the near future.
Lloyd Ackerman, as the young
idealist, was sincere and forceful.
Judge Lakin, as the Chairman of
the Committee, clearly demon
strated the advantages of a person's
working in a Little Theater group,
for with each role his technique im
proves, until his present perform
ance was a nearly perfect one.
The comedy relief was supplied by
the character of Solomon Fitzger
ald, astute politician and student of

j human nature. The role was ably
I filled by Mr. DuPrau, who turned
in one of the best characterizations
yet seen at the Community Theater.
As the "political whip, Levering"
was Professor William Owens, who
played the part of the typical party
leader excellently. Amelia Baines,
the ingenue lead, was quite good,
playing her role with poise and
I finesse.
