"CARDINAL RICHELIEU"
At the Stanford Theater
Once again George Arliss outwits
i his enemies, surmounts all odds, and
! brings the ship of state to safe har
| bor. This time the state happens to
Ibe 17th century France and the

clever statesman
portrayed by
Arliss, Cardinal
Richelieu, but
the plot of this
picture is sub
stantially like
that of the other
Arliss produc-

j tions. The Englishman (no longer
; billed as Mr. George Arliss, inci
| dentally) gives his usual suave per
: formance, and the picture is enjoy
i able if you don't mind repetition.
! "MARY JANE'S FA"
Those who have been complaining
i about the double-bill diet the local
: theaters have been dishing up will
1 have to swallow their words as far
I as this program is concerned. Aline
j MacMahon and Guy Kibbee furnish
i some of the best comedy that has
i been seen in the vicinity for some
: time, and "Mary Jane's Pa," a story
i of a country newspaper and politics,
i proves to be at least as entertaining
j as the featured picture, if not
| more so.
