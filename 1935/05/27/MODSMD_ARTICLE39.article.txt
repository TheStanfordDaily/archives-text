"OPEN WIDE THE GATES''
(STANFORD VERSION)
That was a beautiful performance
of "Buth Your Houses" at the Com
; munity Theater last week-end. A
Stanford man's play was cheered by
u Stanford-Palo Alto audience—the
whole thing clicked. But the audi
ence not only cheered the acting: it
apparently approved the theme—the
government Ls rotten with graft. And
everyone was properly disgusted
| with the congressmen whose motto
j was "Get all you can, and the coun
try be damned."
Unfortunately, most people con
sider a play just a play—pretty in
( itself, but totally unrelated to any
j thing else. And the good citizens of
! Palo Alto who were shocked at the
low state of Congressional morals—
in the play—will go out and re-elect
the representatives who can get
them another such stately U.S. Post
Office. And the Stanford student
body president who could appre
ciate the evils of raids on the treas
ury—in the play—will undoubtedly
appear before his Ex Committee to
morrow evening and make final
plans for a last little assault on the
j A.S.S.U. purse.

There are some people who think
that for months Ex Committee has
labored long and hard. No one is
more firmly convinced of that than
Ex Committee. And so, Ex Com
mittee, out of the greatness of its
soul and the magnitude of the
A.S.S.U. treasury, is planning to re
ward itself. Tentatively, $45 of stu
dent money have been set aside for
an Ex Committee party. That, of
course, is not in the nature of a
salary or a pension. For Ex Com
mittee undoubtedly believes its col
lective worth is more than 545. It is
just a farewell gesture. Ex Commit
tee's last backslap to Ex Committee,
and kiek-in-the-pants to the student
body.
Some months back, The Stanford
Daily wanted the A.S.S.U. to give it
a little special money for an ice
cream party. The sum was trivial;
but Student Manager Cave right
fully denied the request. Then the
editor managed to carry the ice
cream party on his petty expense ac
count, which was clearly misappro

1 piiation of public funds. The main
point being that The Daily was no
more entitled to have a personal
' party at the expense erf the A.S.S.U.
than is the Rally Committee, or the
Cardinals, or Cap and Gown, or the
I Cardinal Chess Club, or any other
J campus organization. And the mere
! fact that Ex Committee has direct
■ access to the student body treasury
| does not give it any moral right to
J raid that treasury to satisfy its per
i sonal gastronomic and other desires
—even to the extent of $45.
Ex Committee is no more entitled
! to the $45 merely because it has put
| up with the student body than is the
j student body entitled to a free ban
. quet merely because it has put up
: with Ex Committee. Still, there is
nothing that can stop Ex Committee
I fiom voting itself the Si 1 ). Lest it be
' a latent sense of what is ethically
: right.
