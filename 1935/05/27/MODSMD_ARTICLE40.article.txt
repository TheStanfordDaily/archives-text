### 
While Stanford's 1.C.4-A. track- i
men made ready for their trip east, '
five Card varsity trackmen of this i
year and one of last season took high !
honors on two other fronts.
The outstanding feat of the week- i
end was a re'cord-breaking discus '
throw of Gordon "Slinger" Dunnâ€” j
17(> feet, 6 inches, far beyond the
world mark of 171 feet, 11 7m inches, i
held by Harold Andersson of
Sweden.
Mark Ruled Unofficial
Dunn's throw was ruled unofficial
since it was made in an exhibition
performance, although officials at ;
(he Humboldt High School meet in !
Eureka, where the sensational heave |
was made, declared th-it as far as 1
other technicalities were concerned j
the throw was 0.K.; Slinger stayed (
within the circle, there was no wind, |
and the platter sailed the record i
distance.
The annual Pacific Association ,
Junior meet at Kezar Stadium on
Saturday was the scene of other
Indian track and field activities over i
the week-end. Leroy Kirkpatrick, [
Montezuma High School senior, who j
will enter Stanford this fall, was '
ihe sensation of the afternoon.
The prep flash wo/i the 100-yard I
dash in 10:1, set a new meet record
of 14:ti in the high hurdles, and took j
third after falling over a barrier in
the lows. His time in the high sticks
is within a fifth of a second of Sam i
Klopstock's fastest, and breaks the j
old meet mark of 14:9, held by Tom |
Moore, now of California.
