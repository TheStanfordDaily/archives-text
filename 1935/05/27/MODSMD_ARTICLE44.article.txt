A BUSY WEEK-END
FOR SPORTSMEN

WHAT NEXT FROM
JESSE OWENS?

Last week the sports world looked
forward to a comparatively unexcit
ing w£ek-end. Saturday night the
sports . world knew it had been
wrong.
From Stanford's point of view the
high spot came When Lawsort Little
closed his fingers around the British
amateur golf championship, won the
distinction of being the only Amer
ican to take .the affair two straight
years.
Those enthusiastic Britishers who
watched Little drive down the wind
swept fairways at St. Anne's-On
the-Sea, who saw him defeat their
own Dr. William Tweddell by one
stroke in the final round, won't soon
forget the man who took the cham
pionship to America for the fourth
time in the 50 years' history of the
tourney.
Coach Eddie Twiggs of Stanford's
golf teatn won't soon forget his
feelings at the word of that victory,
either. Twiggs started working on
Little's drive, along with a lot of
other points, before the British
tournament last year. He taught
him how to handle drives when the
wind was high, how to keep the ball
lew on such occasions.
There wei'e a lot of things that
contributed to Little's win, but most
of the authorities agree that it was
his ability to cope with the wind on
that English course last week that
was principally responsible for the
victory. Twiggs has reason to re
joice.

And then back on the North Amer
ican continent Saturday a sprinter
from Ohio State by the name of
Jesse Owens proceeded to turn in
three world's records, tie another,
and turn topsyturvy the standards
of what one man is supposed to do
in one day. The 220-yard dash, the
220 low hurdles, and the broad jump
records have been considered almost
unbreakable lately.
And now one man races 220 yards
in 20.3 seconds, three-tenths better
than Roland Locke's world record
time, speeds over a low hurdle flight
in 22.6 seconds, taking four-tenths
of a second off the joint record of
Norman Paul of U.S.C. and Charles
Brookins of lowa, and runs the cen
tury in 9.4 to tie Frank Wykoff's
100-yard dash mark.
But these were just common
place occurrences in the course of
the afternoon for Mr. Owens. He did
the affair up right as the meet neared
a close by broad jumping 26 feet 8 I7 4
inches. It was an unheard-of dis
tance. Japan's Chuhei Nambu had
leaped 26 feet 2 !/ 8 inches in 1931, a
world's record that, if broken at all,
would not be broken by any great
margin. At least so it appeared. Now
our friend Owens adds more than
6 inches to the mark.
The most amazing thing of all
about Owens is that he is just a

I sophomore. Wonder what he'll be
doing to some of these records in
1937?
And along with Little's and Owens'
} triumphs of the week-end comes
word of the lack of triumph of Ken
tucky Derby and Preakness win
ner Omaha at Belmont Park Sat
urday.
And still more sports news broke
when Babe Ruth, object of many a
discussion on just how long a home
run hitter can hold his top phace,
i showed that he hadn't lost the "art
I yet when he blasted out three hom
: ers for -the Braves against Pitts
j burgh.
Yes, it was an active week-end
I for sportsmen.

and turn topsyturvy the standards
of what one man is supposed to do
in one day. The 220-yard dash, the
220 low hurdles, and the broad jump
records have been considered almost
unbreakable lately.
And now one man races 220 yards
in 20.3 seconds, three-tenths better
than Roland Locke's world record
time, speeds over a low hurdle flight
in 22.6 seconds, taking four-tenths
of a second off the joint record of
Norman Paul of U.S.C. and Charles
Brookins of lowa, and runs the cen
tury in 9.4 to tie Frank Wykoff's
100-yard dash mark.
But these were just common
place occurrences in the course of
the afternoon for Mr. Owens. He did
the affair up right as the meet neared
a close by broad jumping 26 feet 8 I7 4
inches. It was an unheard-of dis
tance. Japan's Chuhei Nambu had
leaped 26 feet 2 !/ 8 inches in 1931, a
world's record that, if broken at all,
would not be broken by any great
margin. At least so it appeared. Now
our friend Owens adds more than
6 inches to the mark.
The most amazing thing of all
about Owens is that he is just a

I sophomore. Wonder what he'll be
doing to some of these records in
1937?
And along with Little's and Owens'
} triumphs of the week-end comes
word of the lack of triumph of Ken

A BUSY WEEK-END
FOR SPORTSMEN

WHAT NEXT FROM
JESSE OWENS?

Last week the sports world looked
forward to a comparatively unexcit
ing w£ek-end. Saturday night the
sports . world knew it had been
wrong.
From Stanford's point of view the
high spot came When Lawsort Little
closed his fingers around the British
amateur golf championship, won the
distinction of being the only Amer
ican to take .the affair two straight
years.
Those enthusiastic Britishers who
watched Little drive down the wind
swept fairways at St. Anne's-On
the-Sea, who saw him defeat their
own Dr. William Tweddell by one
stroke in the final round, won't soon
forget the man who took the cham
pionship to America for the fourth
time in the 50 years' history of the
tourney.
Coach Eddie Twiggs of Stanford's
golf teatn won't soon forget his
feelings at the word of that victory,
either. Twiggs started working on
Little's drive, along with a lot of
other points, before the British
tournament last year. He taught
him how to handle drives when the
wind was high, how to keep the ball
lew on such occasions.
There wei'e a lot of things that
contributed to Little's win, but most
of the authorities agree that it was
his ability to cope with the wind on
that English course last week that
was principally responsible for the
victory. Twiggs has reason to re
joice.

And then back on the North Amer
ican continent Saturday a sprinter
from Ohio State by the name of
Jesse Owens proceeded to turn in
three world's records, tie another,
and turn topsyturvy the standards
of what one man is supposed to do
