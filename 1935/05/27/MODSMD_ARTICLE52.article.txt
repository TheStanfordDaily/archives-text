Intramural baseball for 1935 comes ;
to an end today, with ft'nal games to
be played in both hardball and soft
ball. The defending champion Sigma
Nu team will meet the Alpha Delts
in the regulation ball contest on the
varsity field. At the same time, the
Dekes and the Business School will
tangle on the frosh gridiron for the
playground ball crown.
Sigma Nu Favored
With a star pitcher in Ed Proctor,
a team of heavy hitters, and a record !
of fairly steady fielding, the 19154
title-holders are given a slight edge
over the Alpha Delts.
The latter nine, conquerors of El
Campo, has two heavy sluggers in :
Barney Smith and Johnny Miles,
and one of the league's better hurl
ers in George "Granddad" Naylon,
but their infield doesn't function as
smoothly as the Sigma Nu's.
Expect Pitching Duel
The Dekes are favored oVer the
Business School in their twice
postponed game. This affair may
well develop into a pitchers' battle
between Dick Kelley of the Row out
fit and Ernie Arbuckle of the grads. |
Final results of the spring relays, !
held on Angell Field Wednesday, i
Thursday, and Friday, found the
Alpha Delts winning with 19 points,
two more than Encina 3E. The Dekes ;
and Sequoia II tied for third with |
seven points each, and Theta Chi |
and the Breakers finished in a dead- j
lock for fifth, each with five mark
ers.

More than two-thirds of the stu
dents registered in the University
of Washington eatn their way ei
ther in whole or in part.
