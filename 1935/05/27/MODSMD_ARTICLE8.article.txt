# FOUR-MAN CARD TEAM EN ROUTE TO I.C.4-A. MEET
## Klopstock, Mottram, Levy, Reynolds To Defend Title Saturday 
### Mort D'Evelyn 
Closing a year of alternate debate
and suspense, Stanford's four-man
track team and Assistant Coach Bill
Ellington last Saturday night step
ped aboard the Overland Limited for
Cambridge, Mass., and next week
end's 1.C.4-A. championships.
Though the team is barely half as
large as the famed "Seven Aveng
ers" that st< tied the track world by
winning the national meet last
year, most of the fans are surprised
and pleased that Stanford is repre
sented at all. Following the 1934
meet, the Farm faculty board issued
a statement to the effect that the
Indians would not participate in an
other 1.C.4-A. meet, and it was only
several weeks ago that the decision
was modified.
Humbert Smith Out
At that time the faculty ruled that
only star performers would be sent
to Cambridge, and it was this ruling
that reduced the Stanford entries to
four. The ailing leg that kept him
out of recent competition made
Humbert Smith's points too much a
matter of chance, and the high
jumper was ruled off the team Fri
day morning.
Stanford did send:
Sammy Klopstock — A hurdling
junior who won the lows in last
year's Cambridge meet and is
counted on for at least one first
place. Klopstock's greatest compe
tition will come from the Coast hurd
lers who have pressed and some
times defeated the Stanford ace in
competition this spring.
Johnny Mottram—A senior, with
the third best American javelin mark
oi the year, and 218 feet should give
him first or secopd.
Jim Reynolds—Sophomore weight
man, with great, competitive ability
and good chances for a first if he
puts his best, 51 feet 5 inches. Rey
nolds will probably compete in the
discus, but will not be doped for
any points in this event.
Phil Levy—With Reynolds he will
continue the Slanford tradition of
taking the first places in the weight
events. If he can stay ahead of
S.C.'s Kenny Carpenter first place
is not too much to expect.
25 Points Needed
Summed up, Stanford's four-man
team is about as sure of first or sec
ond places as any four men entered,
but their team strength is dwarfed
alongside the Trojans, with 15, and
California, with 10. Between 25 and
30 points will be needed to land
ahead of the Trojans, and top for
the Indians will be 25. Coast track
experts are hoping last year's cham
pions will come in third, and make it
a clean sweep for the West.
