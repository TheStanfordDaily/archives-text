CALLENDER, Ont., May 26 (/!»>. —
The crackle of brush fires, sweeping
over a wide area, sounded tonight
within a quarter of a mile of the
hospital where the Dionnc quintup
lets arc housed, and heavy smoke
rolled over the back acres of Oliva
Dionne's farms.
At spots along the road leading
from Callender to the trim little
structure known as the Dafoc Hos
pital for the Dionne quintuplets the
flames lapped at the sandy highway,
and the heat from fire was felt by
persons in motorcars.
Grim-faced men fought the fires
which, because of the dryness of the
brush lands and the wide front,
along which they moved, were stead
ily advancing in the direction of the
building.
Fire breaks, consisting mostly of
brush piles, have been piled along
the road even beyond the hospital*.
No one would say that the little
institution itself v was in danger. The
fire, however, was creeping slowly
that way, sending clouds of smoke
rolling over the back section of the
farm operated by the quintuplets'
father.
