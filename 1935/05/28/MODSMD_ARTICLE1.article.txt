# SUSPECT PLAN FOR RELEASING WEYERHAEUSER
## Family Asks That Federal Agents' 'Interference' Be Ceased Now THINK MESSAGE SENT 'G-Men' Withhold Plans; Seek Three Suspects 
### 
' TACOMA, May 27 </P).â€”A strong
intimation that the family of 9-year
old George Weyerhaeuser, curly
haired victim of a $200,000 kidnaping
plot, had made contact with his ab
ductors came late today with his par
ents' firm request to federal agents
to cease their "interference."
It also was learned authoritatively
that the famed "G men" of the De
partment of Justice were definitely
seeking at least three suspects, but
all information concerning the
agents' activities was withheld.
A possible "contact man" was seen
to enter the palatial Weyerhaeuser
home with a brief case, and then to
emerge 15 minutes later without it.
Government Not Wanted
The plea from the boy's anguish
stricken mother and father, Mr. and
Mrs. J. P. Weyerhaeuser of the
wealthy lumber family, was couched
in strong terms.
"We most earnestly ask you not to
interfere further," they said. "If you
refuse to do this it will bring all our
efforts to naught."
An interpretation placcd upon the
request was that the kidnapers may
have contacted the parents with a
second message in the flood of let
ters, telephone calls and special de
livery messages deluging the Weyer
haeuser residence.
Believe Uncle Contact
Shortly after noon F. Rodney Tit
comb, uncle of the missing child,
was was kidnaped Friday noon, en
tered the Weyerhaeuser home with a
brief case, and it was believed he
might have been designated as a
"contact man."
The boy's father and F. Marfield
Bolcom of Seattle, a family friend,
were known to be inside. There was
no apparent "watching" of the home
by federal agents, but an observer
saw Titcomb leave within 15 min
utes without the brief case.
Seek Tan Sedan
No further amplification of the
information that the "G-Men" were
searching for three suspects was
available immediately. On Satur
day, however, a request went out
from police here to watch for a tan
sedan carrying California plates.
