# HALL CONTRASTS HUMAN VALUES
## Professor Calls Leisure Lost Art in KGO Talk 
### 
f Professor Everett W. Hall con
| trasted human purposes and values
| of modern times with the individual
j spirit of ancient and medieval ages
I in his talk last evening on the KGO
Stanford Radio Hour, in which he
discussed ''The Contemplative Ideal
j in a World of Action." He drew the
I contrast citing today's world of ac
j lion, which may be traced back to
, the vast control over nature pre-
I sented by the development of mod
j ern science, in comparison to olden
! times when another spirit ruled,
I that of contemplation as the goal
I rather than action.
In regard to this, Professor Hall
| pointed out that the former gen
| eral pacc of life was leisurely in an
era when leisure was detrimental
because of the lack of efficiency in
economic production. Today, how
ever, in having developed a tech
nique of production so efficient
that it allows and requires a great
amount of leisure, the art of em
ploying leisure time properly is
lost.
Professor Hall advised that society
' rediscover leisure. To do this he in
j troduced the contemplative ideal as
! a means and as the supreme ideal.
He defined contemplation as an ex
i perience of thinking or feeling for
I its own sake because one values
J v/hat is thought or felt, for itself and
j not anything one may do with it.
| He emphasized that this idea must be
| developed in education through
i books and works of art.
