# CHARGE MONEY READY TO BACK HOUSE FACTION
## Brennan Flays Interests Rumored Paying For Bloc in Session 
### 
SACRAMENTO, May 27 (IV).â€”
Ugly rumors that "certain interests"
were prepared to finance "certain
legislators" in the overtime session
of the legislature were flung before
the Assembly today by James Bren
nan, San Francisco member of the
House.
Brennan's speech quickly brought
down a storm of condemnation from
a half dozen members of the As
sembly, and a demand of Assembly
man Jones, Montebello, that he
withdraw his statement went un
heeded.
The husky San Franciscan, famed
for his prosecution of Warren K.
Billings in the San Francisco Pre
paredness Day bombing cases, made
the speech as final debate began
upon the question of passing the
$352,000,000 Mcrriam budget.
Jones To 'Hold Out'
Jones had warned the House that
he was prepared to "hold out" un
til the last in an effort to pass some
of the "social and tax legislation we
came up here pledged to fight for."
The Democratic leader, in using
the- term "hold out" meant that he
hoped 27 members, or a third of the
House, would vote against passage
of the budget at this time because of
the fact that no legislation had yet
been enacted for increased old age
pensions and other points in the
program of the Liberal Democrats,
Fifty-four votes are needed to pass
the budget with an urgency clause.
"Rumors are going around,"
shouted Brennan, "that certain
members of this legislature are be
ing financed to remain here. If that
i.s true it is the most corrupt bargain
anyone in this legislature could en
ter into. Anyone who is party to
such a thing is party to a corrupt
agreement and he has no right to
be here."
Hunt Strikes Back
Angered at the statement, Assem
blyman Hunt, Los Angeles, said:
"I'll say that if any of my col
leagues need money and I have it,
I'll loan it to them and it's none of
anybody's damn business!"
Brennan denied he intended such
an implication. "I told you what I
heard and if you want to know
where it came from I'll tell you it
came from one of your own bunch,"
he retorted. Jones accused Brennan
of simply "trying to get his name in
print."
Assemblyman Wagner, Oakland,
gaining the floor, charged that "every
member of this minority group has
been here every day and not absent
five or ten days on prolonged jags."
