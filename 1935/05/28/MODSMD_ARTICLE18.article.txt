# Dionne Babies Celebrate First Birthday Today
## 
### 
CALLANDER. May 27 (/!>>.—The
one birthday gift the government
in Ontario would like above all else
to place in the cribs of the Dionne
quintuplets, who arc 1 year old to
morrow, is harmony—an end to the
unfortunate bitterness of the babies'
parents.
There is no precedent for the situ
ation, just as there is no precedent
for quintuplets surviving a full year.
That there should be disgruntle
ment on the part of Mr. and Mrs.
Oliva Dionne because of the ar
rangements under which the babies
I became wards of the king is some
j thing the government is making
J every possible effort to rectify.
