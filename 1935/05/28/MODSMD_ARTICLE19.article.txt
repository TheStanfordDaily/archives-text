# Supreme Court Brands NRA Unconstitutional In Unanimous Decision
## Five-Year Moratorium For Farm Mortgages Also Killed by Justices DECISION UNANIMOUS Rights of Mortgage-Holders Backed by Brandeis 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 27 (/P). â€”
The Frazier-Lemke act, granting a
five-year moratorium for paying off
farm mortgages and affecting bil
lions of dollars of indebtedness, was
held unconstitutional today by the
Supreme Court.
In a decision read by Associate
Justice Brandeis, it ruled on a case
brought, by the Louisville Joint
Stock Land Bank against William
W. Radford, Sr.
The Federal District Court for
Western Kentucky and the Sixth
Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the
legislation affccting farm debts es
timated at $12,000,000,000 by the
Minnesota Attorney General.
Courts Divided
The Supreme Court's ruling was
unanimous.
Other courts had divided on the
act, some upholding it and others
ruling it unconstitutional.
In signing the bill, forced through
Congress in the closing hours of the
last session, President Roosevelt said
it probably would need amendment.
The law provided for the mora
torium if attempts failed to scale a
farmer's debt down to a figure he
could pay. The property could not
be foreclosed during the five yars if
the owner paid a "reasonable
rental."
In addition, the act enabled the
farmer to obtain full litle to his
property by payment of its ap
praised value, regardless of the
amount stipulated in the mortgage,
at the end of the five-year period.
The Case
Radford, a Kentucky farmer, had
taken advantage of the law after de
faulting on payments on a $9,000
mortgage held by the banks.
He refused an offer of $9,500 for
his property when the bank tried to
buy it in. Under the Frazier-Lemke
statute, he retained possession of it
by paying $325 annually, with an
option to clear his indebtedness by
repurchasing of $4,445, the price ap
praisers fixed.
Brandeis Ruling
Brandeis ruled the act constituted
the taking of property from the
holder of the mortgage and giving it
to the farmer without compensation.
He said the law applies to mort
gages existing prior to its enactment
and that it was invalid under the
fifth amendment.
The act's supporters argued the
financial distress of farmers justi
fied the measure, asserting mort
gaged indebtedness was so burden
some that otherwise the majority
would be dispossessed and be
come tenants of banks and insur-
I ance companies,
