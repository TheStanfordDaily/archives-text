President Roosevelt late today called
lin Attorney General Cummings,
Solicitor General Stanley Reed, and
I Donald Richberg, head of NRA, to
; study the Supreme Court ruling
that NRA was unconstitutional.
The President and his key legal
; aids gathered at the White House to
; map their course.
Although several administrative
agencies are operating under the
NRA, some officials said they be
lieved the Federal Alcohol Control
Authority was the only one
knocked out by the decision.
The FACA was set up through the
| code making authority section of
| the act, and is administering six
j codes governing various alcoholic
{ beverage industries.
There are numerous other agen-
I cies based on other sections of the
act which expires June 16. These
include the petroleum administra
j tion board, central statistics board,
| export-import bank, the automobile
i labor board, the electric home and
| farm authority, and the cotton, silk,
j and wool assignment boards.
The FACA has 168 employes.
The NRA has 4500 employes, most
, of them in Washington, who are
engaged administering the 757
I codes invalidated today.
In a separate concurring opinion,
Justices Cardozo and Stone asserted
; "to take from this (poultry) code
i the provisions as to wages and the
hours of labor is to destroy it alto
; gether."
I "If a trade or an industry is so
| predominately local as to be exempt
' from regulation by the Congress in
respect of matters such as these,
there can be no 'code' for it at all.
