# Commerce Clause Violated, Presidential Authority Oversteps Bounds
## ALL CODES ABROGATED New Deal Legislation Meets 'Complete Defeat' 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 27 OP).— I The
NRA, with its vast code structure,
was branded unconstitutional today
by the Supreme Court in a decision
which left the Administration and
Congress in bewilderment and con
fusion.
On two specific counts the high
i court unanimously cancelled the
! codes. It held Congress had given
too much authority to the President,
' and that code provisions went too
far in regulating transactions not
I directly affecting interstate com
j merce.
557 Codes Hit
First impression of the decision de
! molished the whole system of 557
i code agreements, including several
operated by AAA; abolished federal
regulation of the liquor traffic, and
I seriously imperiled pending legisla
lation on labor and other subjects.
In one high and informed quarter
j it was said the decision was "a com
! plete defeat" for the New Deal,
i Hurried conferences at the White
House and on Capitol Hill shed little
light on the future. Whether NRA
' could be revived by new legislation
| was in dispute. On all sides respon
; sible officials and legislators asked
for time to study the words of the
j court.
Urge Consideration
Equally shaken and in confusion
were the heads of the code authori
i ties —the boards named by the in
dustries to administer the codes.
They urged deliberation. One said
too much had been gained to be
thrown away. Another contended
industry "will find some way of ac
complishing NRA's objectives."
To the White House, President
Roosevelt summoned Donald R.
Richberg, head of NRA; Attorney
General Cummings and Solicitor
General Stanley Reed who argued
NRA's case before the court. They
planned a thoroughgoing study of
, the decision before the issuance of
any official statements.
Court Tense
The high court's decision, read by
Chief Justice Hughes before a tense
! courtroom into which crowded Rich
berg and other New Deal lights,
i stirred the capitol as has nothing else
for months.
Reading slowly and with emphasis,
Justice Hughes marked out the two
main counts against NRA. At one
j point, he said:
"Extraordinary conditions may call
! for extraordinary remedies, but the
( argument stops short of attempting
I to defend action outside of constitu
tional authority.
"Extraordinary conditions do not
: create constitutional power."
Quirk Action
Spreading out from Hughes' words
I were a swift rush of developments,
i statements of opinion and of ideas a.s
to what should lie done to handle the
| situation.
The House Ways and Means Com
: mittee, in charge of now-doomed
i Administration plans for extending
NRA for two years in much its old
! form, met almost immediately but
adjourned with nothing accomplish
ed. Its chairman, Doughton of North
Carolina, asserted: "It will require
! careful study."

Urge Consideration
Equally shaken and in confusion
were the heads of the code authori
i ties —the boards named by the in
dustries to administer the codes.
They urged deliberation. One said
too much had been gained to be
thrown away. Another contended
industry "will find some way of ac
complishing NRA's objectives."
To the White House, President
Roosevelt summoned Donald R.
Richberg, head of NRA; Attorney
General Cummings and Solicitor
General Stanley Reed who argued
NRA's case before the court. They
planned a thoroughgoing study of
, the decision before the issuance of
any official statements.
Court Tense
The high court's decision, read by
Chief Justice Hughes before a tense
! courtroom into which crowded Rich
berg and other New Deal lights,
i stirred the capitol as has nothing else
for months.
Reading slowly and with emphasis,
Justice Hughes marked out the two
main counts against NRA. At one
j point, he said:
"Extraordinary conditions may call
! for extraordinary remedies, but the
( argument stops short of attempting
I to defend action outside of constitu
tional authority.
"Extraordinary conditions do not
: create constitutional power."
Quirk Action
Spreading out from Hughes' words
I were a swift rush of developments,
i statements of opinion and of ideas a.s
to what should lie done to handle the
| situation.
The House Ways and Means Com
: mittee, in charge of now-doomed
i Administration plans for extending
NRA for two years in much its old
! form, met almost immediately but
adjourned with nothing accomplish
ed. Its chairman, Doughton of North
Carolina, asserted: "It will require
! careful study."
WASHINGTON, May 27 OP).— I The
NRA, with its vast code structure,
was branded unconstitutional today
by the Supreme Court in a decision
which left the Administration and
Congress in bewilderment and con
fusion.
On two specific counts the high
i court unanimously cancelled the
! codes. It held Congress had given
too much authority to the President,
' and that code provisions went too
far in regulating transactions not
I directly affecting interstate com
j merce.
557 Codes Hit
First impression of the decision de
! molished the whole system of 557
i code agreements, including several
operated by AAA; abolished federal
regulation of the liquor traffic, and
I seriously imperiled pending legisla
lation on labor and other subjects.
