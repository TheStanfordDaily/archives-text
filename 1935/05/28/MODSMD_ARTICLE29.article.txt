The Supreme Court's devastating and un
animous decision of yesterday places the Mine
Kagle, symbol of NRA-ism, on the shelves of
the Smithsonian Institute with the other
famed relies of American history. The ruling
dark is any Administration hopes for a re
vamping of the codes into workable, yet legal,
weapons.
Sum and substance of the decision was that
Congress had exceeded its authority by dele
gating broad and all-inclusive powers to the
President to draw up codes of fair competition
and that the Federal government had no
power to regulate hours and wages in trans
actions all'ecting interstate commerce.
Loopholes for a revised NRA set-up were
lew. Regardless of the economic conditions,
the government had no right, the court held,
to transcend constitutional restrictions. The
definite and unanimous ruling was a discour
aging blow to New Deal plans.
Attempts to evade the ruling by invoking
the right of contract or b> prosecuting a
breach of contract were hindered in the dis
carding by Chief Justice Hughes on the theory
that the codes were voluntary, and the em
phasizing of the fact that they were codes of
law and therefore illegal.
To add to the shamhush that the high court
was making of the New Deal, the Frazier-
Lemkc act which granted a live-year mora
torium for paying oil' farm mortgages on more
than ten billions of dollars of indebtedness
was also held unconstitutional.
The entire recovery program seems to top
ple. A body of nine venerable judges, in one
of their rare unanimous decisions, balk Roo
sevelt in the carrying out of one of his biggest
schemes. The smiling chief executive, mean
while, seeks to steady bis shaky structure.
The entire nation awaits bis next move.
