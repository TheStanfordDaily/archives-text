# Quid Number of Chappie To Wind Up Year's Work
## 
### 
The "Quid"' number of Chap
arral, which is the only bur
lesque issue of the year, has the
happy Chiippies pounding the
pavement and the cerebellum
these days, thinking up a new
way to pin the bird on fore
most campus figures.
Coming out two days after
the appearance of the Quad, the
"Quid" will be the final jour
nalistic effusion of the college
year, and the last hope to carry
the students into finals. (Some
one else will have to carry them
out, says Editor Steedman.)
"Our senior section is a reve
lation," Editor Steedman says.
"See yourself as others seize
you. If you think your picture
in the Quad is fenny, you
should try to recognize your
se If in the 'Quid'."
