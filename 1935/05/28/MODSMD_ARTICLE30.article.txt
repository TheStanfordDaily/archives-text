# Praises to a Stanford Musical
## 
### 
I his Friday night the one and only edition
<Â»l the "Follies Bourgeois" lakes place in tlie
Assembly Hall.
II marks tlie lirst time in ;i number of years
lliat the Farm again presents a spring musieal.
Conceived by the students, and'carried out
with student talent, such a production has
been needed during the spring quarter lor
some lime, and at last it becomes a reality.
Student response to plays on this campus
has been very disappointing. The plain facts
are thai there seems to be no interest in se
rious, or light, or any other types of drama.
Still llic (iaieties manages lo draw a full house
every football season.
Aside from trying to stage financial suc
cesses, the purpose of the theater on the cam
pus is to entertain. The Follies seems certain
to do Ibis. For this reason, a ticket would
be a wise investment.
