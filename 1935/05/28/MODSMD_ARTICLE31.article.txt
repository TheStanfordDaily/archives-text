### 
When one of our supposedly inferior races
comes through right under our noses with a
performance never approached hy a while
athlete lour world's records in one day it
should give us pause to think.
It is easy enough to pooh-pooh far-off echoes
of the virtues of Chinese tolerance and ra
pacity for happiness, of .Japanese literal*- and
cflieiency. It is easy to discount the stories
ill untrained African natives who can high
jump <S to Id feet l>v nsing a slight mound of
earth as a take-oil'.
Hut this performance was definite and con
clusive, and hy an American negro. Indeed,
cocky self-complacency of while peoples at
large, and Anglo-Saxons especially, could well
lake a rude setback. Posisbly the time has
come when Western civilization must slop
pronouncing itself the world's best and set out
to prove it.
To Jesse Owens, both as an athlete un
surpassed and as an object lesson extraordi
nary, should go our high praise.
