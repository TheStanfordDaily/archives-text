# That Certain Spring Feeling
## 
### 
Despite llir precarious fjile <»l llie merchant,
the hakor and the man in the street, despite
the I act that President Roosevelt probably
spent all last night trying to avert national
calamity by some emergency plan, that certain
time of the year is definitely with us on the
Stanford campus.
Haystack fires are only one minor sign. The
campus cops, shining their headlights on cars
parked along the golf course road, are another.
And last, but not least, are the wild tales that
wend their way into the editorial offices.
Most amusing is the one concerning four
students found on the slopes of Mount Tanial
pais, starting their own private little nudist
colony. Some three years ago, the tale of the
Stanford woman who was found improvising
Ihe latest dance steps in front of a mausoleum
was the classic of the year. But the nudist
colony motif dwarfs the other by comparison.
Second on the list was the recent over-the
week-end experience of the Stanford gentle
man and his escort who were asked lo put

' their automol)iie into a Paly garage and pro
| eeed homeward on their own volition. The
Hough proceeded to protest so vociferously
that lie was taken to the local hastile by Sir
Law. The feminine element meanwhile
sneaked into the garage, took the car out,
j and was on her way homeward when she too
was apprehended for a second time and fol
lowed her escort's footsteps.
It all goes to prove that every year there
i comes ;i time, and when it comes, until spring
fever is over, many singular things seem to
hannen.
