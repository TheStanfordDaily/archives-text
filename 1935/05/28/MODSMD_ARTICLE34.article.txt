When a senior receives his degree, he thinks he
has absorbed everything out of college that he possibly
—the knowledge that accompanies a degree, a i'ew
close friends and many acquaintances, and lots of
good clean fun, or at least lots of fun.
But there is something definitely lacking to this
picture—friendship and association with professors.
For it must be acknowledged lhat professors, with
their training and experience, have something to offer
students besides lectures, finals, and grades which
determine one's Bawlout fate.
Adult ideas ;\re a valuable acquisition to a
college student, and these can be gained only
through personal contact with professors. The
ideas which they expound in class are too often
only those of the textbook or what is suggested by
the administration. Their personal ideas are usu
ally interesting and progressive, and would aid the
students in forming opinions, and getting a ckvf
picture of modern problems.
But, as in every suggestion, there is a catch to it.
The ever-increasing popularity of that fatal word
apple-polishing" spells the doom of any co-ordination
between student and professor. In a small college the
word is seldom heard—contact outside of the class
room between student and teacher is a common thing,
regarded as a perfectly natural procedure, whereby
both parties are benefitted.
But when the university is run on the class aver
age basis, any step taken by the student toward more
personal association with (he professor is branded as
"apple-polishing." When the person is successful,
which means pulling down an "A," the idea is taken
up with great fervor by the rest of the class. Which
would seem that they're really starting to take an
interest in the professor. But, unfortunately, that is
not the case. They tell him how much they like his
course, and he suggests outside reading which would
further class discussion. But they forget the suggestion
as soon as they leave the classroom, and pride them
selves on having made a favorable impression on the
professor.
On the other hand, there are students who are really
interested, and who would appreciate personal contact
with the professor, knowing that they would benefit
by it, and have an entertaining time withal.
But professors recognize the tendency of the stu
dents to profess interest. With this idea in mind con
stantly they can't encourage contact outside the class
room to a great degree. In the present state, a good
deal could be done to better relationships.
