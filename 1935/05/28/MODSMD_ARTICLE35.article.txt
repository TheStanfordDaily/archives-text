# OUR HASHER SEZ:

I am coerced into reporting a new series of "atrocity
stories" about the various and sundry gentlemen who
inhabit that imposing edifice known as the Phi Delta
Theta house. It is not of my own doing. It was many
moons ago that I formulated the earnest conviction
down deep in my heart of hearts that I had written
the last publicity release for the local chapter of Phi
Delta Theta, but the local chapter of Delta Gamma
turned over a few new leaves and forced my hand.
It is both fitting and proper that the dying days of
a hectic campus year should close with this last sound
ing of taps, this last blast of the bugle. The unfor
tunate liason befween the Deegees and the Phi Delts
has been a cause of continual friction, and that poor
little space of 30 feet that separates the two houses
has not had a moment's rest for 10 long months.
The statement of the case advanced by the coun
sel for the Phi Delts is that alNrs between the
two organizations were in perfect harmony until
the day that the Deegees painted the window in
the Delta Gamma shower room, while the women
claim that conditions have never been of the
best.
The nature of the Delta Gamma complaint is drawn
up in a tremendou* treatise of some 30 pages in length,
which they have submitted to campus police, and
which contains details of offenses for some 15 years
biick. The police, not knowing exactly what can be
done except to grow hay between the two houses,
make hay while the sun shines, and then guard it with
police at night, have in turn shown the indictment to
the gents in Grand Hotel, which has been the cause
for much merriment in those quarters.
For one thing the Deegees claim that it has been
a Phi Delt tradition to raid the Deegee icebox, saying
that if the kitchen door is locked, the Phi Dells have
been known to walk right in the front.
Excessive noise at all hours of the night is an
other vice. The Deegees claim that the perceptible
shift of the Phi Delt house and its settling on its
foundations toward the south is unmistakable
proof of unseemly and undue piling up of human
ity spying on Delta Gamma activities. The Phi
Delts absolutely deny that they hold their house
meetings in the dark, and claim that the Deegees
do as much counter-spying, conducting many novel
experiments with searchlights to bear out their
contention.
The Chi Omegas are at one wilh their Pan Hellenic
sisters across the street in the "Hate Phi Delt" tradi
tion. The intermittent showers of phonograph rec
ords on the Chi Omega sleeping porch, and the use
by the Phi Delts of the Chi Omega driveway for a
combination race track and parade ground has stored
up resentment despite the Phi Delt hasher tradition.
When an unlucky youth wrecked his car while issuing
from the Chi Omega driveway the other day, one of
the prettiest sights of the collegiate year was to see
the Chi Omegas leaning out their windows and laugh
ing till they were sick.
The biggest and cardinal point in the Deegee
"atrocity stories" centers around the Phi Delt B-B
gun. This little instrument is used by Phi Delts for
probing what lies behind Delta Gamma window
screens. Among the casualties have been Ed. the
Filipino cook, several hashers, and many Delta
Gammas.
A last minute news flash to The Daily late last
night, from the Delta Gammas, disclaimer! all respon
sibility for the Deegee "chain letter." and blamed it on
the house mother.
