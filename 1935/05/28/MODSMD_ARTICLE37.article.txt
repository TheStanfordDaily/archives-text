# BULL SESSION
## "JOBS" 
### 
This June thousands of men and I
women will be literally turned out !
of dozens of American universities. ;
And having been prepared for a life
of leisure by four years' college !
training, a large percentage of '35's
graduates will step with an accus
tomed stride into the ranks of the
unemployed.
The phenomenon—"From Fifty-
Yard Line to Bread Line in Four
Years"—is not a new one. In recent
years, it has become the normal
thing. Yet "What shall we do with
the college graduate?" is not a ques
tion that can be considered separate
and apart by itself. College grad
uates get no jobs for the same rea
son that ten million others get no
jobs; and ten million others get no
jobs simply because there are no
jobs to be gotten. It is as horribly
simple as that.
The New Deal, of conse, has been
trying to do something about the
situation. And although it has failed
as yet to materially reduce the num
ber of jobless, it has at least coated
the bitter pill of unemployment
with PVVA and FERA sugar. Various
other bodies and busy-bodies have
volunteered their aid in settling
once-and-for-all the national di
lemma; the Townsendites have
agreed to accept $200 per month from
the government, if that will help
lecovery. Huey Long has offered
to make "every man a king," if the
people will first reciprocate by mak
ing Huey Long a president. The
American Legion is even willing to
drain the treasury for the sake of
recovery—of the American Legion.
But newest and juiciest of recovery
programs is the proposal for a Na
tional Labor Dollar set forth in a
book titled "Jobs" (the work of the
father of a Stanford student).
Very briefly, Labor Dollar is the
'commodity dollar" with "labor" as
the adjustable commodity. The new
dollar will be "stabilized" to equal
"two hours' common labor." When
there is unemployment, and the
price of labor tends to fall below 50
cents an hour, the government will
buy labor for use on public works,
and so steady wages. When labor is
scarce, and wages tend to rise above
the Jiorm, the government will tax
income, and again steady wages.
And with a few more wrinkles,
everybody is happy.
The most apparent answer to local
Labor Dollarites (yes, we have two
or three on the campus) is that if
you are going to give the govern

ment enough power to make Labor
Dollar a howling success, the gov
ernment could use that power to
stabilize the national economy with
just plain old spondulicks—without
confusing the issue with Labor Dol
lars. And now that we already have
"baloney dollars," the issue Ls con
fused enough as matters stand.
Labor Dollar, and Townsend Plan,
and Huey Long Plan, and all the
rest have one important thing in
common: they indicate a definite
striving among the people of the
tand to do something. Never before
was it more true that "Something
Must Be Done." And unless some
thing sane is done to give jobs to
the ten million, and to the thou
sands more who will pour forth
from the universities this June, we
may yet have Townsend pensions
paid in Labor Dollars under the
crackpot leadership of Huey Long
—a king.
