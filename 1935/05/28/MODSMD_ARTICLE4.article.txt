# Executive Group To Hold Farewell Banquet Tonight
## Consideration of Awards, Appointments Set For Business Session Committeemen To Review Quad Staff Issues 
### Irvin Jorgensen 
Because this is the day of the Ex
Committee "party," su
preme legislative body will break a
long-standing custom and hold its
business meeting this afternoon at
4:30 o'clock in the Old Union council
chamber.
After the business meeting, the
group will adjourn to the Union,
where it will hold its annual fare
well banquet. Because the Health
Service clamped down on Ex Com
mittee's attempts to convert its ban
quet into a dance in a San Francisco
hotel, as Ex Committee did last
year, the committee will stay on the
campus.

tive offices are expJfted. Appoint
ment of the Quad business manager

Series for next year may be given
if plans of Music Manager Norman

today's meeting. Several outstand
ing stars have been tentatively
scheduled but a complete series has
not as yet been rounded out.
