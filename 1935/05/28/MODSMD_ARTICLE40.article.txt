# CAMPUS OPINION
## 88 CENTS A CLASS 
### 
Ehe Editor, Sir:
Figuring on the basis of ten weeks
S and 13 hours registration, each of
us pays 88 cents per class hour.
This morning at an 8 o'clock, a
' young lady and I were ordered be
fore a hundred students not to en
ter the room because we were a few
minutes late. We went in anyway.
J It is perfectly legitimate for a pro
| lessor to use all his power of bluff
I (a surprisingly efficacious quality in
, a teacher) to scare his students into
I coming on time; but it is without
j his rights, as I see it, to refuse them
entrance, however late they may
S come. Courtesy on the part of stu
dent and teacher is, of course, requi
site in university work. We should
be prompt. When, because of vicissi
tudes of fortune and after having
i made an honest, even desperate, ef
-1 fort to be on time, I come late, it is
i my opinion that I should be allowed
i to enter as unobstrusively as pos
sible and sneak into a side seat.
Having paid my 88 cents( in my
case this quarter $1.13), I shall at
tempt to get my money's worth by
; attending class, even though, as is
j frequently the occurrence, I shall
i ultimately be cheated through hav
ing to audit a dull and platitudinous
i lecture.
And another thing—THE STAN
FORD GRADING SYSTEM (the
working of which is exceptionally
j well exemplified in this class). Al
| though the education department of

| Stanford University has developed
j the finest, most just, most modern
! tests, we in other departments are as
; a matter of routine subjected to
; essay examinations long antiquated.
I do not mind taking such examina
j tions, I know their value and their
I place, but I object to being graded
; 81-82-83 upon an examination which
asks me my opinion concerning a
piece of literature (I being a grad
uate English student) and which is
i corrected by a history assistant who
I can't surely know as much about
! the subject as 1 do. Even God
would hesitate to grade as precisely
as does that assistant to the Stanford
I Department of History.
And upon such grades (and other
extenuating considerations) are
awarded scholarships—which to poor
| souls like me mean salvation or
j damnation. My remarks are not a
| matter of "sour grapes," for I hap-
I pen to be among the fortunate in
| this game of intellectual roulette,
j Yours sincerely,

This morning at an 8 o'clock, a

fore a hundred students not to en
ter the room because we were a few
minutes late. We went in anyway.

I (a surprisingly efficacious quality in
, a teacher) to scare his students into
I coming on time; but it is without
j his rights, as I see it, to refuse them
entrance, however late they may
S come. Courtesy on the part of stu
