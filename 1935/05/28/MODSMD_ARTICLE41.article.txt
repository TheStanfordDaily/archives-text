"PYLON," by William Faulkner.
Harrison Smith. $2.50. At the
Stanford Bookstore.
Anyone who prefers his reading
to deal with normal and wholesale
ways of life and who shuns books
that deal with the perverse refine
ments of the human race should
take warning immediately and shie
away from William Faulkner. For
once again in "Pylon" he has car
ried on the tradition started in
"Sanctuary" of writing a .story of
intense realism, with his characters
distorted by poverty and lust, per
verted by the exigencies of environ
ment and nature.
"Pylon" is the story of a trio of
aviators —two men and a woman,
living from hand to mouth. Neither
know nor care which of the men is
the father of the child. They are not
human beings—they are part of an
airplane, and no more animate than
the propeller or wings. As Jiggs, the
mechanic, says of Shurnann, "Cut
him and it's cylinder oil; dissect
him and it ain't bones; it's little
rockerarms and connecting rods."
A reporter, depicted as a "Walking
Cemetery," joins the group when
they come to take part in a Loui
siana air event. Fascinated by their
very air of inhumanness, intrigued
beyond reason, and utterly unable to
tear himself away from the group,
the reporter is beyond a doubt the
most interesting character. He is no
more a human being than they are;
he is an inquirer, seeking compre
hension and understanding; his is a
body of printer's ink, paper, and
typewriter ribbons.
Possibly such characters as Faulk
ner has created exist; but it is rather
hard to believe it. At any rate,
"Pylon" is a novel of intensity, pas
sion, and tremendous force. What
ever one may say concerning Wil
liam Faulkner's outlook upon life,
it cannot be denied that he is pos
sessed of one of the best vocabularies
of the American writers, and handles
words with the deft touch of an old
master.
