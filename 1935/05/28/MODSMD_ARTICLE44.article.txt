CAL MARKS HEADY
FOR X.C.2-AA
Over at Berkeley they are already
getting .set for the National Col
legiate A.A. meet .slated to be rur
oil 011 Edwards Field June 21 and 22
and to all indications every prepara
tion possible is being made to tun
out an affair that will lead to i
general messing-up of the world';
record books.
The Associated Press circulated
a story last week concerning a
"guide" of established standards
for athletes contemplating en
trance to the affair. Although not
ironclad it was to serve as a basis
for the splitting of $12,0011 guaran
teed by University of California
toward the transportation costs of
from six to eight outstanding per
formance in each event.
T1 10 standards in the "guide" arc
reported to compare largely with
performances that took sixth placc
in last year's N.C.A.A.
They read like this:
100-yard dash 09.S
220-yard dash 21.13
440-yard dash 48.9
880-yard run 1:5(>.0
One-mile run 4:22.0
Two-mile run 9:40.0
High hurdles 14.9
Low hurdles 23.8
Shot put 48 ft. 6 in.
Discus 150 ft.
Javelin 200 ft
Hammer throw 150 ft.
High jump G ft. 4 in.
Broad jump 24 ft.
Pole vault 13 ft. G in.
OWENS VS. ANDERSON—
WIIAT A HUNDRED!
At first glance it would appear
that the '"guide" were just a trifle
stiff. Six feet 4 inches in the high
jump, 9.8 in the century, 21.3 for
the 220- —those look like pretty fast
times for sixth place winners.
But a look at. the field tells us why.
Take the hundred-yard dash, for in
stance.
In the favored spots are Ohio
State's super trackman, Jesse Ow
en's, and Cal's George Anderson.
What a race those two "fastest hu
mans" —both have been called that —
will stage when they put on their
act which will last just a little over
nine seconds. Owens ran the cen
tury in 9.4 to tie the world's record
last. Saturday.
George Anderson stopped the
head timer's watch at the Fresno
Relays three weeks ago in 9.5. Of
course there has been a lot of
talk about five watches clocking
Anderson at 9.2 but it seems that
the only way Georgie can prove
lie really ran that fast is to do it
again.
But these are just the first two.
Milton Holt of Fresno won't be very
lir behind and Michigan's Willis
Ward is no slouch either. Both these
men are capable of 9.5 or better and
cither one might upset the whole
; rrangement and surprise Messrs.
Owens and Anderson. In fact, most
. nything can happen when four
.< uch dash men match strides.
Although every event won't be
as hotly contested as the hundred,
it can easily be recognized that
Cal's guide is just about right
when it forecasts that a 9.8 would
take a sixth.
Investigation shows that most of
the figures, stiff as some may seem,
hold fairly true for a sixth position
in the kind of competition that Ed
wards Field will see next month.
