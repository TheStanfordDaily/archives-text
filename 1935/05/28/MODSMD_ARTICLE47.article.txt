# Four-Man Team Hopes To Place In I.C.4-A. Meet
## Levy, Reynolds, klopstock, Mottram Journey East 
### 
j Unless a series of awful breaks
J break out like the measles at Cam-
I bridge Friday and Saturday, Bill
I Ellington's Four Fightin' Fools
(should bring back to the Farm five
I —well, maybe four—blue ribbons, as
| tokens of I.C.A.A.A.A. champion-
J ships.
Unlike the "Seven Avengers" of
i 1934, who avenged with the best
of them to win the 1.C.4-A. last
spring, Ellington's quartet are
j more ne-»r to being the "Four
| Scavengers"—out to pick up all
they can get, beg, borrow, scrape,
j or steal.
| The present quartet, who are at
j present en route to the eastern sea
-1 board, seeing America first via the
j tourist class, haven't got a prayer
| of annexing team honors, but they
j are going to take advantage of all
; they can—entering five events and
| planning to win them all.
Chance in Weights
i Jim Reynolds and Phil Levy, the
I v/eight-tossing duo, are the surest
j of winning—provided the meet com
j mittee okehs Levy's eligibility Fri
day. Back East 48 feet is considered
a great put, and 115 feet a great
j heave. Jim and Phil can do both
j with their sweatclothes on.
Svnniy Klopstock and Johnny
Mottram will have more difficulty
j staving oIT various enemy chal
lenges. Bleacher coaches are
picking Sam to win one hurdle
i race and place in the other—they
don't say which is which because
he can win either but ol' debbil
I chance is adverse to a double win
! in big time hurdling.
j One thing—Sam won't be bothered
j with Jesse Owens or Gleen Hardin
in the lows because neither belong
I to the 1.C.4-A.
Mottram is also on the ragged
j edge. He will be meeting Hal Odell,
| who has two verdicts over him in
| as many years, and who is capable of
j 219 feet. Johnny is also capable of
| this mark, but has shown the tend
! ency in big meets to take it easy and
| be sure of himself, thus not putting
| his all into what counts—distance.
