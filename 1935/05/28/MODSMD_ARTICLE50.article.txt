# Sigma Nu Wins Hardball Title
## 
### 
| Scoring four runs in their last pe
riod at bat, Sigma Nu's hardball
team retained its championship by
defeating the Alpha Delts yesterday,
10 to 5. The winners, who got off to
an early 3-0 lead, were never headed,
although the Alpha Delts tied the
score in the fifth.
Ed Proctor pitched a strong game
for the Sigma Nu's, allowing only
two earned runs, both in the sixth
frame. George Naylon, on the mound
for the Alpha Delts, tired in the last
two innings. Larry Randall, Archie
Coffin, and Bob Foster starred at bat
for the victors with three hits each,
and George Fuller got a trio for the
Alpha Delts.
Business School obviously knew its
; business yesterday on the frosh foot
ball field when they let the Deke
softball nine down on the short end
of a 6-4 contest to decide the mural
j championship. Ernie Ar'ouckle, busi
ness school's hurler, was in rare form
as 11 Dekes fell before him.
