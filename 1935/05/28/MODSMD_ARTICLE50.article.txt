### 
| Scoring four runs in their last pe
! riod at bat, Sigma Nit's hardball
team retained its championship by
! defeating the Alpha Delts yesterday,
! 10 to 5. The winners, who got off to
j an early 3-0 lead, were never headed,
j although the Alpha Delts tied the
! score in the fifth.
i Ed Proctor pitched a strong game
I for the Sigma Nu's, allowing only
jtwo earned runs, both in the sixth
; frame. George Naylon, on the mound
for the Alpha Delts, tired in the last
two innings. Larry Randall, Archie
Coffin, and Bob Foster starred at bat
for the victors with three hits each,
and George Fuller got a trio for the
! Alpha Delts.
Business School obviously knew its
; business yesterday on the frosh foot
ball field when they let the Deke
i softball nine down on the short end
of a 6-4 contest to decide the mural
j championship. Ernie Ar'ouckle, busi
| ness school's hurler, was in rare form
[as 11 Dekes fell before him.
