# Williams Admits Part in Extortion Plot Against Ivey
## Government Agents Seek Crime Accomplices 
### 
LOS ANGELES, May 27
Department of Justice agents said
today that Jack Williams, shot eight
times last Saturday night when he
attempted to extort $72,000 from
Herbert D. Ivey, millionaire San
Marino banker, had admitted to them
he was "there to watch the pay-off."
Williams was trapped by G-men
and San Marino police in a lonely
spot near Belvedere as he approach
ed an automobile he believed to be
driven by Ivey.
Williams from Texas
Talking incoherently, Williams to
day told B. G. Sackett, chief of the
Federal Bureau of Investigation
here, that he was from Texas.
Sackett, admitting the possibility
Williams worked alone in writing a
series of extortion notes, said every
precaution was being taken to arrest
others who might be involved in
the plot.
Has Chance for Life
"If he had accomplices we'll find
them and bring them in," he said.
"Williams has about a 50-50 chance
to live. I hope he does live, for we'll
file charges of attempted murder and
use of the mails to send extortion
letters against him. Each letter
carries a sentence of 20 years, and
as there were five letters, Williams
would get 100 years."
