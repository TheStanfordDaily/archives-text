# TRAVELS OF A STANFORD ROUGH

### GRANT LEIBERT 
Guadalajara.
Sunday and the bullfight. My first
one, and I had a grand time even
if I didn't understand the art of
bulls and bullfighting. The scene
was in an oval stadium, made of
adobe, which boasted five bands and
about one-third capacity audience.
After much music and bow-taking
by everyone but the bulb, the arena
was cleared, and the chute door was
opened for the first bull to make
his entrance. But no bull came forth.
Boos, hisses, yells, and still no bull.
Not until someone reached in and
gave him a severe prod in the flank
did he come out. A few half-hearted
swipes at the torero, bullfighter, who
was annoying him and he came to a
standstill.
Out came two fellows on horses,
advancing very cautionsly toward
the animal, whom they speared with
their long pikes. This got his dan
der up and with a few snorts he
made after the nearest torero, who
jumped behind the protection of a
stout wooden cage. The bull could
n't get in the cage with him so he
did the next best thing—jumped over
the fence surrounding the arena and
took after the mob in the narrow
passage way between the fence and
the front wall of the grandstand.
This irregular action caused the
caretakers, attendants, etc., to clam
ber over the fence into the bull ring
proper. "Now, 1 here's a bull for
you," I said. "One who is willing to
carry the fight to the enemy, and
put up a battle for his life." But
wrong again, as usual. Against the
catcalls of the crowd, which was on
the point of bursting its blood ves
sels, my friends informed me that
the brave bull does not leave the
ring during the performance, but
stays there making passes at the
torero until he receives the lie i' the
neck.
They got him into the ring again
and slipped him the cold steel. With
the bull's last snort, the gates are
thrown open and a team of six mules
gallops in to drag the body to the
butcher shop. The band strikes up,
the next fighter is announced, and

the battle goes on. Five more bulls,
but they all met death in the con
ventional manner, and were ap
plaudt d. I still insisted that the first
bull put on the most entertaining,
not to mention intelligent, per
formance.
Tomorrow: Mexico City.

Tomorrow: Mexico City.
Guadalajara.
Sunday and the bullfight. My first
one, and I had a grand time even
if I didn't understand the art of
bulls and bullfighting. The scene
was in an oval stadium, made of
adobe, which boasted five bands and
about one-third capacity audience.
After much music and bow-taking
by everyone but the bulb, the arena
was cleared, and the chute door was
opened for the first bull to make
his entrance. But no bull came forth.
Boos, hisses, yells, and still no bull.
Not until someone reached in and
gave him a severe prod in the flank
did he come out. A few half-hearted
swipes at the torero, bullfighter, who
was annoying him and he came to a
standstill.
Out came two fellows on horses,
advancing very cautionsly toward
the animal, whom they speared with
their long pikes. This got his dan
der up and with a few snorts he
made after the nearest torero, who
jumped behind the protection of a
stout wooden cage. The bull could
n't get in the cage with him so he
did the next best thing—jumped over
the fence surrounding the arena and
took after the mob in the narrow
passage way between the fence and
the front wall of the grandstand.
This irregular action caused the
caretakers, attendants, etc., to clam
ber over the fence into the bull ring
proper. "Now, 1 here's a bull for
you," I said. "One who is willing to
carry the fight to the enemy, and
put up a battle for his life." But
wrong again, as usual. Against the
catcalls of the crowd, which was on
the point of bursting its blood ves
sels, my friends informed me that
the brave bull does not leave the
ring during the performance, but
stays there making passes at the
torero until he receives the lie i' the
neck.
They got him into the ring again
and slipped him the cold steel. With
the bull's last snort, the gates are
thrown open and a team of six mules
gallops in to drag the body to the
butcher shop. The band strikes up,
the next fighter is announced, and

the battle goes on. Five more bulls,
but they all met death in the con
ventional manner, and were ap
plaudt d. I still insisted that the first
bull put on the most entertaining,
not to mention intelligent, per
formance.
