Skits by prominent campus au

and George Kaufman, will be fea
tured in "Follies Bourgeois" this
Friday evening. Bill Rogers, Dave
Mellinkoff, and Waldo Salt provided
continuity for the musical.
Dorothy Parker is the author of
"After Such Pleasures" and "Figs
Among Thistles." She describes
herself as follows:
"But I. despite expert advice
Keep doing things I think arc nice.
And though to good I never come,
Inseparable my nose and thumb."
Robert Benchley, her partner dur
ing their early years as writers, was
to review a play, but asked Mrs.
Parker to go in his place. All, in
cluding its author, Charming Pol
lock, expected a flattering comment.
The nexl morning Benchly opened
the paper, turned to his column,
and saw only one lineâ€”" 'The House
Beautiful' is the play lousy."
Another famous review was de
scribing Kathcrine Hepburn's per
formance in "The Lake." "Miss Hep
burn," said Dorothy Parker, "runs
the gamut of emotions from A to B."
George Kaufman is equally well
known as dramatic critic on the
New York Times and as author of
"Dulce," "To the Iv-vdies," "The
Royal Family," "Animal Crack
ers," "June Moon," "Beggar on
Horseback," and "Strike Up the
Band."
He has collaborated with such
famous authors as Mark Connolly,
Edna Ferber, and Ring Lardner.
His play, "Still Alarm," will be
dramatized in the "Follies Bour
geois."
