# PRICE-CUTTING IS THREATENED AS NRA FALLS
## New Deal Leaders Confer To Survey Wreckage After Decision ROOSEVELT ON SPOT Constitutional Amendment Considered by Labor 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 28 (A } ). —
Guerrilla price cutting and a threat
ened coal strike of nation-wide pro
portions rode the wreckage of NRA
tonight a.s the New Deal groped in
some confusion for a pathway in the
future.
President Roosevelt summoned
congressional advisors, explored
with them the crisis caused by the
abrupt sentence of death imposed
on the Blue Eagle by the Supreme
Court and—reached no conclusion.
William Green, president of the
American Federation of Labor, fol
lowed them into the presidential of
fice, frankly discouraged and pessi
mistic, after an hour spent with his
lieutenants measuring "the extent of
the blow."
In the back of some Adminis
tration minds there lingered,
meanwhile, a proposal to revive
NRA on a voluntary basis, with
provisions covering hours, wages,
and child labor, hut with all co
ercive or compulsory clauses elim
inated.
From New York and Boston came
dispatches telling of price slashes,
despite the Administration's appeal
of last night that industry continue
to observe the codes through the
period of readjustment.
Meanwhile, a high Administration
official said he had been informed
by an important labor leader that
labor was seriously considering a
drive for a new constitutional
amendment. Such an amendment
would state the fedei'al govern
ment's powers in control of com
merce much more broadly than at
f present.
The argument in favor of an
amendment, one official said, is that
it would remove from the confusion
of many years' standing the ques
tions of interstate versus intrastate
commerce.
Legislation Held Up
Dismayed by the abrupt manner
in which the court halted the new
deal in midstride, congressional
chieftains ordered all major legisla
tion held up pending study in the
light of (he high tribunal's pro
nouncements.
Affected, many feared, were the
social security bill, the measure for
abolishment or regulation of public
utility holding companies, the codes
of AAA and the Wagner labor dis
putes bill, which bears partial White
House sanction.
House Adjourns
An impending deluge of Republic
an gloating was headed off in the
House by a quick adjournment, but
the Senate remained in session and
fought it out toe to toe. Majority
Leader Robinson maintained that all
regulation of intrastate commerce
was now impossible. Black of Ala
bama contended this 30-hour week
bill was unaffected. His insistence
centered more and more attention
upon that measure.
