# FRENCH CABINET MAY QUIT POSTS
## Battle with Chamber Over Franc Is Cause 
### 
| PARIS, May 28 (/P). —The French
I cabinet was reported tonight, to be
|so shaken at parliamentary opposi
| tion to its demand for dictatorial
j powers to defend the franc that its
I resignation was a possibility.
Friends of Premier Pierre-Etienne
i Flandin said, however, he might at-
J tempt to dissolve parliament and
| take his fight before the country in
| new elections.
Some parliamentarians asserted
the cabinet might resign tomorrow
| night unless opposition within the
j chamber finance committee and
I former Premier Edouaid Herriot's
| powerful Radical Socialist party was
I overcome.
j Devaluation became an open issue
j in France as Premier Pierre-Etienne
I Flandin's government, its political
j life in the balance, asked parliament
Ito grant it sweeping emergency
i powers to defend the franc.
A grim, almost silent Chamber of
Deputies listened cooly while Fi
nance Minister Louis Germain-
Martin revealed the full frightening
extent of the flight from the franc,
scathingly assailed "speculators,"
declared "devaluation would cause
j general impoverishment in France"
| and pleaded for near-dictatorship
I in economic matters.
With the cabinet's overthrow of
the issue freely predicted in Ihe
chamber lobbies, the deputies ad
i journed until Thursday despite the
government's request it begin dis
cussion immediately.
Strong hostility to the govern
ment's demand quickly developed in
the powerful Radical Socialist party,
which counts 100 deputies in the
chamber.
So strong was the sentiment that,
although no vote was taken at the
party caucus, some members urged
J Edouard Herriot to resign as min
| Lster of state.
