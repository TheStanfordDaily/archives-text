### 
TACOMA, May 28 (/P). â€”Discovery
j of a hidden ramshackle house which
I might have been used as a lookout
I by kidnapers of 9-year-old George
Weyerhaeuser, and report of two
nervous men buying a playsuit for
a boy "about 7" in a store at nearby
Bremerton accompanied tonight ap
pearance of a newspaper advertise
ment, inserted by Mr. and Mrs. J. P.
Weyerhaeuser, saying:
"We are ready, Percy Minnie."
Officials interpreted this as mean
ing the frantic parents possibly had
obtained the $200,000 ransom money,
or probably were seeking to con
tact the abductors in a last moment
effort to save their child from threat
ened harm.
t\ Hours Remain
Less than 24 hours remained of
the five-day limit set by the kidnap
ers, after which deadline they said
"harm" would come to the boy.
Investigators reported finding
the three-story ramshackle house
hidden in trees and underbrush
near where the Weyerhaeuser boy
last was seen.
Report that two impatient men
bought a play suit "for a kid about
seven years old" hi Bremerton,
started Kitsap county authorities on
a hunt today.
Three clerks said they observed
the men in the store. Miss Sally
Painter, a salesgirl, asked them what
they wanted.
"We want a kid's suit something
like this for a kid about 7 years
old," Miss Painter quoted one of the
men as saying.
They chose a brown playsuit and
Miss Painter held up a size seven
for them to see.
"Yeah, that looks all right," one
man said, and the two then left the
store hurriedly.
