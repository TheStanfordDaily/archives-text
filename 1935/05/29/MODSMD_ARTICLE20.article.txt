# Opportunities, Husbands Similiar: Margery Bailey
## 
### ROBERT EISENBACH 
"Opportunities are like husbands;
trap them first and coddlc them af
terwards"â€”that was the advice of
Dr. Margery Bailey given to more
than 1000 delegates to the California
State Business and Professional
Women's Conference at the Palace
Hotel S H,lir day.
She deplored the tendency to play
down feminine apjjenl and approach
the employment problem in a mas
culine way. "Women arc herdi.sh,"
she declared, "insisting on equality
instead of creating their own status
as workers."
They are constantly harping on
rights, instead of opportunities,
whioh she believes are the only priv
ileges. "Opportunities are gained by
the old feminine man-catching tech
nique, which ought to be practiced

lather than suppressed."
Female harping on the aesthetic ,
> appreciation of the "weaker" sex, as j
exemplified in female participation j
in money-raising drives for artistic |
benefit, is empty crowing, she de- |
i clarcd. "Interests are just material j
I things, neither good nor bad be
cause of their objects. The use of t
i artistic things for self-enrichment is
the important function. Edgar in
'King LeaK says 'Ripeness is all.'"
A.s to university teaching as a ca
leer for women, Dr. Bailey cites her
own experience. "Women teachers
are in their jobs on suffrance, she
j said. "The only reason I am at !
Stanford was that two male mem- j
bers of the teaching staff went to
war and did not. return. That was j
my opportunity." j
