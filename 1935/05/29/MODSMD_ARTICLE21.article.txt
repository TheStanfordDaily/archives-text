# EX COMMITTEE PLANS DANCING PARTY IN CITY
## Members Appropriate Part Of Funds from A.S.S.U. Treasury Accounts 
### Irvin Jorgensen 
Ex Committee emerged from its
afternoon business session yesterday
with not only one farewell party but
two.
At the beginning of the meeting a
message from President Marvie
Kahn, who was unable to attend the
session, was read, recommending
that the members pay for their own
meal at the banquet scheduled for
last night, since it might set a "bad
precedent.''
But this did not Ht all strike a
responsive chord in Ex Committee
breasts. Frank Fullenwider flatly
declared that he had received an
invitation through the mail to at
tend a banquet, and he'd "be
darned if he'd pay for it, espe
cially since he had already paid to
get a substitute h-«,hcr."
Fullenwider went on to say that
every other activity in school re
ceived compensation in some form
or other: rings, sweaters, awards,
pins, keys, cups, and salaries. Cal
culating a $2 expenditure for every
member of the Committee for a
dance, he mentioned that would be
a salary of only three cents an hour
for all the time Ex Committee has
sat on weighty problems this year.
"If Mellinkoff doesn't like it," he
said, "that's too bad."
He was referring to The Daily
Bull Session of Monday by Dave
Mellinkoff which stated that a $45
expenditure for an Ex Committee
party was a form of patting one's
self on the back not consistent
with a sense of ethics.
After it was decided that Ex Com
mittee members would not pay for
their own banquet, a little intro
spection by the members convinced
themselves that the banquet was not
Ihe kind of a party they wanted in
the first place, measles or no
measles.
So the committee members finally
decided to have a dancing party in
the city the day finals are over. Ex
penses for the dance will be paid
partly by Ex Committee members,
partly by what is left of the $45 ap
propriation for last night's Union
banquet.
