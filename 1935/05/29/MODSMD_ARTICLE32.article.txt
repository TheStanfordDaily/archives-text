I .succeed himself as Quad business
J manager next year, it was announced

| day afternoon.
The unprecedented reappoint
ment of Fontius was considered
! lengthily by Graduate Manager Al
Masters and Publications Council
: and was recommended by botb
j when it was found that the only
other qualified candidate wis dc
| ficient in scholarship. The ap
pointment passed Ex Committee
without comment.

j managing editor, and Ruth Barnes,
, Marjorie Dempsey, Ellis Dufficy, and
' Fred Terrien, junior editors. The

Union Pays 75 Per Cent
j It took Ex Committee 15 minutes
j to gather a quorum for its "daylight
; saving" meeting, but when it did it.
i plunged into a welter of problems.
Good news on the New Theater ap
propriations was announced, when
the message was read by Presiding
Officer Helen Ray that the Union
Executive Committee announced
i that the Union would pay 75 per
cent of its profits for the next five
years on the New Theater deficit
instead of the 60 per cent formally
agreed to.
The plan further states that
| after the five years, the percent
age will drop to 50, until a Union
emergency fund of 830,000 is built
up. After the emergency fund is
assured, all the Union profits will
go into liquidating the theater
deficit.
j The Union profit last year was
! around $22,000. If the profits con
j tinue, this will mean a payment of
j around $15,000 toward the theater
i deficit, more than the payment of
! around $10,000 that students pay in
I on the Union dollar.
A salty phrase was included in
the Union report: "The existing
I budget not to exceed -$00 for ad
: vcrtising in The. Stanford Daily
| will be continued with the under -
â€¢ standing that upon publication in
| The Daily of 'Uiy matter deroga
tory to the. Union which is not
j true, the agreement for said ad
i vcrtising shall be cancelled."
Publications Council submitted
\ three two-man teams for thf> ap
proval of Al Masters on the binder
dividers activity. The teams arc:
Charles Fontius and Bob Herman,
Ben Cave and Marvie Kahn, Burl
I Van Meter and Everett Moses. The
! 40 per cent profit from the binder
i dividers to be divided between the
three campus publications will be
| split this way: 45 per cent to The
! Daily, 32'/2 per ccnt to the Chap
j arral, and 22Vs> per cent to the Quad.
