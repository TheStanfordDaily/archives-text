# Big Problems Ex Committee "Party Party"
## 
### 
In an edition of the Daily earlier this week,
;ui entire Hull Session was devoted to the ex
traordinary topic of setting aside A.S.S.t'.
money for an Fx Committee "party."
This expenditure of forty-five dollars was
termed :i "last hackslap to Fx Committee and
kick-in-lhe-panls to the student body."
Why it is a kick-in-the-pants to the student
body has not been determined in fact, would
be hard to determine. There happen to he
;i few very solid reasons why the Fxecutive
Committee may, iu this one instance, deserve
what i( asks for.
The committee is made up of student men
and women who are elected by popular vole.
1 hev receive no salary for their jobs, as do
similar bodies at other universities. On the
oilier hand, every Tuesday night from seven
o'clock to any hour that their work is com
pleted usually around ten o'clock these
members discuss student problems in con
nection with the smooth functioning of the
A.S.S.t'.
As h:is been pointed out, every activity on
the campus benefits the people engaged in it
to some extent. Athletes receive their awards
and sweaters, Cardinal members their rings,
Hally Committee their tickets to games and
I rips, debaters their medals. Hut the Fx Com
mittee, for the work it does, ends up with nary
:t nod of approbation, let alone any material
g:tin.
For these reasons, an appropriation of
money for ;i banquet, or whatever such a
committee may see lit, is not out of order.
II is simply recognition of the fact that there
is some reward for nine months of labor.
Such an amount has been provided for in
the A.S.S.t . president's budget, it is not an
extravagance by any means, and is in no way
:i kick-in-the-pants to the student body.
