The honorable Mr. Edwin H. Embree, pres
ident of the .Julius Koscnwald I'und, is at it
again. For the second lime lie hits compiled ;i
list ol the leading American colleges.
The Atlantic Monthly will print the findings
of Mr. Embree in its June number. Mean
while, it might be wise to compose a little
essay on the subject of men who spend their
time ranking colleges. Alter nil. such reports
are a bit arbitrary to say the least, and ;is the
good Mr. Embree himself suggests, the only
eollege satisfied with his rating was Harvard,
which happened to place number one.
Like All-C.oast, All-American football teams,
every selector h;is a different basis, different
methods, and different criteria upon which he
bases his choice. For instance, Embree says
of Harvard:
"Furthermore, Harvard's pre-eminence is
widely one might almost say universally -
recognized among the laity as well as among
scholars throughout this country and Europe.
To hold ;i degree from Harvard carries social
as well as scholastic distinction; to be a mem
ber of its faculty is an honor usually coveted;
its president is ex-ollieio the leader of Ameri
can science and letters."
Since the dear Mr. Embree finds it a "social
distinction" to go to Harvard, and includes
Ibis as one of his qualifications, perhaps
Wellcslcy might be right up there with Har
vard also because the dear little girls really
have the most charming table manners, not
lo mention Pepsodent smiles.
And so Embree's rating breaks down before
the obvious fact that he cannot be completely
objective in his ideas of what constitutes a
leading college. Doubtless the article will be
in print, and arouse much discussion. To
most sensible college thinkers, it is rather
silly.
