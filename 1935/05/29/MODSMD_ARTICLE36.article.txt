# Student Body Presidents and War
## 
### 
Student body presidents meeting in con
vention at Phoenix, Arizona, over the last
week-end took a definite stand on the college
attitude toward war that the right of the
government to embark on an offensive war is
to be submitted to a national plebiscite. The
presidents, accordingly, were instructed to
sound out the reaction of their respective
student bodies to the stand.
A glance at the peace poll taken by the
college editors at the lirst of the year should
ease the minds of the presidents. As for
Stanford, sentiment was most emphatic live
to one for non-support of an aggressive war.
That ratio was fixed following the tallying
of 127 M ballots.
In case of a defensive war. t Diversity sen
timent was .just as emphatic for an opposite
stand for a united and definite defense
stand.
The student body presidents, therefore, look
no doubtful or questionable stand as tar as
college undergraduates of the nation were
concerned. Stanford, according to the recent
editors' poll, definitely stands hack of the atti
tude expressed at the Phoenix convention.
