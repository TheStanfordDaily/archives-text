# Apple Polishing: Bogy-de-Luxe
## 
### 
An old bogy has been raised by C.ampus-to-
C.umpus, in saying "the ever-increasing popu
larity of the fatal word 'apple-polishing' spells
the doom of any co-ordination between stu
dent and professor."
Such twaddle' Gentlemen, is this Hollv

wood High School or Stanford University. '
Apple-polishing is no fatal word here —it is
a lost cause. Most students never give it a
thought.
Firstly, in classes, most students realize
it is impossible t<» polish for grades. Secondly,
anyone low enough to sloop l<> it is deemed
scarce worthy of thought. Ilona fide Vases are 1
so infrequent, and students so indifferent, thai |
the charge is seldom made.
Some Kncinans and Kohleiles may carry a
hit of the old anti-knowing-teachers philoso
phy over from high school, hut it is soon lost
in the shulllc.
Students here do not know professors well
for two simple reasons: the latter are busy
teaching big classes; the students are busy j
with day-to-day classwork and routine of j
Fnivcrsity life.
•For the most pari, laziness keeps students
from looking up professors and knowing them I
intimately, even though most of them are j
only too glad to he known as human beings.
Hut "apple-polishing" is almost an obsolete i
word, and surely ;i negligible force.
