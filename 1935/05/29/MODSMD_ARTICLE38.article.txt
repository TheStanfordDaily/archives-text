## THE 						CHACO WAR: MARTIN 
### CEDRIC LARSON 
In the Chaco, Alsace-Lorraine of South America,
a bloody struggle of nearly three years' duration has
been waged between Paraguay and Bolivia.
Dr. Percy A. Martin of the history department be
lieves that this futile conflict, has at length run its
course due to the sheer exhaustion of both belliger
ents, and points to some of the decisive factors in
volved in the bitter contest.
The Bolivians, a proud and warlike nation of some
3,000,000 people, have long sought an outlet to the ocean
from their landlocked country. Deprived by Chile of
access to the Pacific, the Bolivians turned their eyes to
the Atlantic, which they hoped to reach by means of
the Paraguay and Parana rivers. Paraguay, however,
opposed them.
Paraguay, economically poverty-stricken,
seemed a contemptible foe with its SOO.OOO inhab
itants, ind its small and ill-equipped army. Bo
livia. oil the other hand, (toasted an army several
times larger, trained in modern tactical warfare by
the German, Kundt. But the Bolivians failed to
reckon with the indomitable spirit of the "Para
guayos," a brave and patriotic people, whose leader,
Estigarribia, received his military education in
France.
The Bolivians, Dr. Martin explains, are a people
accustomed to the rarified atmosphere of the Andes
highlands, and when they descended into the low
lands of the Chaco, far from their base of operation,
they soon found unexpected enemies in the heat, in
adequate water supply, lack of military stores, and the
malaria belt of the Chaco.
Tropical contagion fought against Bolivia, and where
Paraguayan bullets missed their mark, the hand of
pestilence took its toll, sadly decimating Bolivian ranks.
By the end of 1933 the first army of Bolivia was anni
hilated and the second ax-my retreating in confusion.
With victory in Paraguay's grasp, a League
commission succeeded in calling a brief truce,
which, however, proved abortive, but gave the
Bolivians time to throw up a network of defenses
across the heart of the Chaco. Hostilities were
soon resumed, and for six months savage and cruel
lighting raged in the lowland jungles.
By December of 1934, it seemed as if the Para
guayos had won the day, for they drove back the
Bolivian line some 150 kilometers, and now have the
Chaco in their grasp. In the struggle for the barren
Chaco wastelands, which are not thought to contain
petroleum, more than 100,000 casualties are said to have
taken place, and the two countries will be impover
ished for years to come.
Dr. Martin believes that the war dragged on so
disastrously for two reasons. In the first place, it was
a question of national prestige for tho.se two warring
nations, and neither one would back down until one
of them emerged victor. In the second place, efforts of
American sister republics and the League commission
to settle the contest pacifically, worked at cross pur
poses and consequently accomplished nothing.
The Paraguayans had the advantage of fighting
near their bÂ°se of supplies, for their capital city,
Asuncion, is just across the river from the Chaco.
They moreover have probably enjoyed clandestine
aid from the Argentines, many of whom are finan
cially interested in the Chaco. And Argentine
capital incidentally means some British invest
ments. These advantages counted heavily in
of the Paraguayos, who have at length expelled
Bolivians from Chaco soil.
The Chaco indeed presents a thorny problem which
may vex South American amit;, for years to come, and
is a challenge to Ihe creation of more efficacious ma
chinery for the pacific settlement of international
disputes.
