## DEMOCRACY OR DEMAGOGRACY? 
### CROMPTON BANGS, Jr 
BOSTON. May 28.—A thousand of you are soon
going out into the cold, cold world where a real fight
is going on. Your years at Stanford have given you
the knowledge you need to get into the fight and win.
Today Democracy is being attacked. You can help
save it. You can save Democracy by showing up its
enemies for what they are, and by showing that
Democracy can do more for everybody for a longer
time than any other kind of government.
Today Democracy is being attacked from two sides.
There are those groups who believe it it, all wrong
because it does not allow the strong to rule and finally
wipe out the weak. On the other side there are those
who claim that Democracy has always been exploited
by the strong and grasping to rob the weak and 1 hereby
defeat social justice.
Although fluey Long and Father Couglilin pri
vately believe lh*'< the strong should rule the
weak and that the less the masses know the bet
ter ofT they are. they are afraid to say that on the
radio. So instead they say there lias been no social
justice under Democracy: therefore it should be
destroyed.
Of course this is untrue, but that doesn't bother
Father Coughlin at all. He is afflicted with a severe
case of Egomania (sometimes known as a swelled head).
He wants to be the man behind the throne in the next
Administration. To there he is willing to stoop tn
anything. Some things Father Coughlin does are ob
vious; some aren't.
The obvious thing is that he is trading on his
nuisance value to write what he wants into the next
Democratic platform. The less obvious thing is that in
the Radio Priest we have all the worst things in the
Church rolled into one. In him are combined the un
scrupu loudness of Rasputin, the mad monk, the greedi
ness of a Mexican archbishop, and the best talents of
Ananias. Quite plainly here we have an example of a
wolf in priest's clothing. True, he may be sincere, but
so i.s a rattlesnake.
