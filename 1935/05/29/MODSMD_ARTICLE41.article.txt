The Editor, Sir:
Thank God for the Supreme
Court! That is no idle expression
of thanks, for the decision holding
the National Industrial Recovery
Act unconstitutional in its vital pro- j
visions not only brings u.s back to ]
constitutionalism, but it means the j
end of a particularly vicious bureau- j
cracy that attempted to enforce its j
orders by Fascist methods. Bureau- !
cracy unrestrained is merely a mod
ern form of tyranny that is en- |
tirely opposed to all democratic
ideals.
The NRA not only fostered mo- ;
nopolies, burdened the small busi- I

ness man, and stifled competition, but
it also was the first steps toward a
kind of Fascism, with its attempts to
limit free speech and press and co
erce everyone. The desirable parts
of the codes, such as those abolishing
child labor and fixing minimum
hours, and wages can be preserved
by other means than setting up a
vast bureaucracy. The decision of
the Supreme Court is a victory,
then, not only for constitutionalism,
but also for liberalism and democ
racy.
