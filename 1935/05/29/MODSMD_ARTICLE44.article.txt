WORD FROM THE
1.C.4-Accs

Tuesday was Dink Templeton's
birthday and Stanford's little band
of 1.C.4-A. competitors and their
coach pro tern, Bill Ellington, who
were on their way east, didn't forget
it. They wired Dink the following
message from Sidney, Nebraska.
WISHING YOU A HAPPY
BIRTHDAY STOP WE ARE OUT
TO KILL
(Signed)
DUKE AND THE FOUR ACES
So now the maestro of track, Bill
Ellington, is "Duke" Ellington, after
the famous maestro of song, and
Sammy Klopstock, Johnny Mottram,
Phil Levy, and Jim Reynolds are
the "four aces," shuffled out of a
whole deck of Card trackmen.
They vow to kill. We hope they
do. We hope that Mottram, Rey
nolds and Levy can "kill" some
1.C.4-A. meet records and that Klop
stock won't "kill" any time getting
over those high and low hurdle
flights.
Yesterday the "four aces"
worked out oil Stag# Field in
Chicago during the morning
hours; tonight they are slated to
reach Boston. The lirst rounds of
competition begin Friday and 011
Saturday the whole affair is wound
up for 1 935.
When the discussion of Stanford's
1.C.4-A. chances is brought right
down to brass tacks the best that
can be reasonably hoped for is a
third place. U.S.C., with her pow
erful squad, is already tightening
lingers around the title and the Cal
ifornia team, three times the size of
Stanford's, is in favorable position
to take second.
Even a third will be no easy job
for four men, but with super per
formances it's a possibility, and a
one, two, three for western teams,
even if Stanford must be content
with the "thx - ee," wouldn't be dis
appointing.

SLINGER SLUNG IT
LAST SATUBDAY

At Eureka last Saturday "Slinger"
Dunn had a big day*throwing the
platter all over the lot. Three times
he tossed over the world record of
Harald Andersson, which stands at
171 feet 11*4 inches and one of those
times the discus sailed 176 feet 6
inches.
Since the meet was an exhibition
affair, "Slinger's" record breaking
throws will never go down as official
but as far as breaking the old stand
ard i.s concerned, "Slinger" did it up
right.
Of his eight throws only one was
under lfiO feet, all the rest were
over 105. Four were over 170
feet, three over 172, and one, his
fifth throw, went the 170 fret <Â»
inches.
Right now he's looking for a meet
to show them that he can do it again,
