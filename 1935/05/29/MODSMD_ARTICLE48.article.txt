### 
Continuing its march toward the
University championship, the soph
omore water polo squad defeated
Ihe senior team 3-1 yesterday after
noon in the varsity pool.
Although the score was compara
tively small, the sophomores, for the
larger part of the game, were easily
superior to their opponents, and
only the excellent goal-guarding of
Leo Cook kept the score down.
Chuck Giffin made two of the sopho
mores' goals and put in another
which was not counted just after the
final whistle blew.
Today's game will feature the jun
ior and freshman teams, each having
one defeat, who will be fighting to
get out of the cellar position. The
game is slated to start at 4:30 o'clock
in the varsity tank.
There are 500 Roman Catholic
churches in Rome.
