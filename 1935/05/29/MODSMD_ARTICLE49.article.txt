# Indian Cinder Squad Works Out En Route
## Stanford, U.C., U.C.L.A. Men in Boston Tonight 
### Warren Breed 
Stanford's Bostonward team of
i lour stalwart tracksters, in com
pany with California's 13 and U.C.
L.A.'s two, worked out yesterday
I morning at Slagg Field, Chicago, and
left at noon for the Hub City.
The 19 athletes, chaperoned by
Coaches Bill Ellington and Brutus
Hamilton, arrive in Boston tonight.
| They will take things easy until
Friday, for there are trial heats in
all the events on that day, with the
finals Saturday afternoon.
Hope To Place
Card hopes still center around the
reaping of four or five first places,
in which case they may end up in
the first three. Dean Cromwell is
counting his 20 Trojans for nothing
less than a massacre, and Cal, with
Sprinter George Anderson trotting
home for two victories, looks like a
pretty fair second choice.
j Phil Levy, the Card discolobus, is
still worried about his plightâ€”he
may not even be able to get on the
field Friday. The 1.C.4-A. commit
tee votes on his eligibility just prior
to meet time, and if his junior col
lege transfer methods fire not ap
proved, he will have made the trip
| in vain.
Klopstock Threat
| When Sammy Klopstock starts
clipping dimes off the Harvard hur
dles he will be one of those threat
ening American and world's records.
His 14.5 into the teeth of a stadium
I gale a month ago speaks for his
[speed against adversity; he is fa
| vored to win the highs, if anyone is,
and has a fine chance of winning the
lows too, for America's cream is
among those absent Saturday.
I The remaining men on the Card
i team, who will be engaged in the
throwing events, are surer of win
! ning than Sam but not so sure of
| toppling any records. Jim Reynolds,
Johnny Mottram, and Levy are the
trio, and are tops in the field.
