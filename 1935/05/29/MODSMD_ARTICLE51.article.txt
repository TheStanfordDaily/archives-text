# Gridmen End Spring Work On Saturday
## Kicking, Blocking Stressed In Workouts 
### 
A strenuous practice session of j
j kicking and blocking was in order i
I yesterday afternoon as the spring !
edition of the Stanford lootball ma- !
chine swung into its last four days
of practice before Saturday's inter- |
squad game, which will officially i
culminate workouts for the Indians )
until next fall.
According to Coach Tiny Thorn- j
hill, the remainder of the week j
will be devoted to light workouts, ;
signal practice, passing, and other
less strenuous activities. Thorn
hill laughingly remarked that !
there's no use killing the boys off
just before finals.
On Thursday he plans to have ;
dummy scrimmage and a little prac- j
tice on kickoffs, but on Friday about j
| a half-hour's limbering up will be !
I all that is required.
Saturday's tilt, which will be
' played in the stadium, promises to !
:be an outstanding affair even j
j though several players who would !
â€¢ be sure starters are slated to be on !
the sidelines due to injuries. Carl j
Schott, Monk Moscrip, Keith Top- (
! ping, Jay Todd, and Bob Mangin are
definitely out, while Alex Trompas j
and Johnny Reisner are doubtfuls. 1
