# Brooke Returns From Meeting of Student Leaders
## A.S.S.U. Leader Is Elected Vice-President 
### 
Wally Brooke, recently elected
student body head for next year,
was named vice-president of the â– 
Pacific Student President's Associa
tion at their convention held last
week-end at Tempe and Phoenix, -
Arizona. Brooke was- one of 25
presidents and presidents-elect rep- I
resenting 14 universities and an es- j
timated 50,000 students of the west- i
era states. j
Tom Lambert of U.C.L.A. was
elected president of the associa
tion, while Ed Smith, of the Cali
fornia Agricultural School, was
named secretary-treasurer. U.S.C. |
will be host for next year's meet- j
ing, which will be held partly on
the U.S.C. campus and partly at
Catalina.
A representative of the National
Students Federation of America ad
dressed the convention at one of its
sessions. The P.S.P.A. is one of the
units of the national federation. The
federation's next meeting will be
held in Kansas City next Christmas
vacation.
Although it did not pass a definite j
resolution outlawing war, the meet- j
ing took a vigorous stand on the j
question. Presidents were requested |
by the convention to find out on i
their own campuses the reaction of !
students to the convention's stand >
that the right of government to em
bark on an offensive war is to be i
submitted to the national plebiscite. |
