# Durand To Inquire Into Dirigible Wreck Causes
## 
### ROBERT EISENBACH 
When a huge dirigible crashes at
sea, headlines scream of cost in lives
| and money and the merest man in
the street decides that lighter-than
air craft is a national indulgence,
perhaps writing to his congiessman
to vote down appropriations for fu
ture airship projects.
The next day an airplane crashes.
Here, too, is an appalling loss in
lives and money; but here the na
tion does not rise to protest further
construction or operation of heavicr
than-air craft.
Frequently, the spectacular quali
ties of dirigible disasters blinds the
public to the fact that their causes
may be removed by carefully con
sidered recommendations by in
formed authorities, believes Dr. Wil
liam Frederick Durand, professor
emeritus of mechanical engineering.

At present, he is at work in his
laboratories on just such recom
mendations as chairman of the Fed
eral Committee on Airships, ap
pointed by the U.S. Navy to review
and analyze the design and con
struction of airships, and to make
recommendations as to future
changes. Together with Dr. Durand,
eight American aeronautical experts,
meeting in Washington, D.C., in
April, prepared for extensive re
search work to determine if a rea
sonably safe and useful airship can
be built.
"The question requires many
months of work," Dr. Durand de
clared today. "We must first de
termine the meaning of the phrases,
'reasonably safe,' and 'reasonably
useful,' before we can proceed to full
consideration."
