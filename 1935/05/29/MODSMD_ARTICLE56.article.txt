# BULL SESSION
## SAVE THE CONSTITUTION 
### BY AMENDING IT 
NRA—sired by the United States
| Chamber of Commerce, mothered by
I Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and
godfathered by General Hugh S.
[ Johnson—has been declared uncon
| stitutional by the Supreme Court of
i the United States. NRA was born of
' an earnest desire to put men back
' to work and take America out of
] depression. But the Supreme Court
i holds that "earnest desire" is not
j sufficient warrant for (1) the Con
j gress to delegate its powers to any
I other branch of the government, or
j (2) for the federal government to
| attempt the regulation of intrastate
I commerce.
I
i Aside from the fact th;il NRA had
I not achieved its major objective—
I i.e., to raise wages and increase em
| ployment on a wholesale scale—the
! Blue Eagle mechanism had been at-
I tacked for months on the grounds
: that it was, in fact, unconstitutional,
| and that it constituted bureaucratic
I regimentation of business. It is to
the shame of the present adminis
| tration that it dodged a test of NRA's
constitutionality until the present
| moment. But now that the uncon
i stitutionality of the "recovery"
measure has been authoritatively
settled, there still remains the very
important question of whether the
central government should under
any circumstances attempt to control
business with a view toward a plan
ned economy.
Putting aside the specific manner
in which the Democratic adminis
tration has attempted to control
business, we believe that there yet
exists a crying need for a greater
control over industrial enterprise
than at present exists. The circum
stances which gave rise to a neces
sity for NRA or some form of large
| scale control of business were un
; planned and often irrational pro-
I duction, resulting in waste and glut
| of the market; disregard of the ne
! cessity for keeping consumer pur
i chasing power in step with produc
! tion and prices; "sweating" of labor;
i widespread employment of child
' labor resulting in lowered wage
| scales and fewer jobs for adults, and
| of the gradual undermining of the
; health and educational require
ments of the rising generation; and
i "cut-throat" competitive practices
j making it increasingly impossible
j for honest men to stay in business.
Those circumstances still hold
; sway. And though the Supreme
j Court has declared that the fed
eral government lacks the power to
j control those conditions, the eco
; nomic evils that plunged us into de
pression yet remain to plague the

I body politic. If those evils are not
j cured, we must resign ourselves to
further depression, further suffer
ing, further poverty in the land of
j the greatest plenty.
Experience has demonstrated that
i industry will not regulate itself in
| enlightened fashion (insofar as the
i public is concerned). The states—as
: individual units—laek the unanimity
!of purpose, the breadth of vision,
I and the co-ordinating mechanisms
| to regulate an economic system that
is national in scope. The only hope
for the rationalizing of mass pio-
I duction and mass distribution lies in
| federal control. Since the Supreme
\ Court decrees that the federal gov-
I ernment cannot at present assume
| that control, the Constitution of the
United States should be amended to
| remedy the government's impotence.
I
I
When the Constitution was drafted
i its specific provisions were beauti-
I fully adequate to the economic sit—
I uation of the day. But as industry
j continues to grow, and maladjust
!

j ment continues to mount, the Con- |
stitution—unless amended—will un- '
dergo a process of progressive emas
! culation by the economic forces of
J the machine age.
NRA has indicated both the evils
and the necessity for federal regu- !
, lation. With the experience of NRA
behind them, the leaders of the na- i
tion would do well to draft a Const i
j tutional amendment allowing the
central government to extend its
| economic powers into the intrastate ;
j field, and providing at the same time j
| against usurpation of legislative
prerogatives by the national execu- !
i tive. Particularly if economic condi- j
: tions continue as bad as they are, the !
I amendment would have an excellent
| chance of passage.
Such a move of course would ;
| drastically alter the traditional !
| federal-state set-up of the United :
i States government. But the present
! depression has indicated above all j
J else that the individual states cannot j
j take care of themselves. State sov- |
ereignty is gradually being under- j
; mined by the expansion of the na- ;
, tional economy, and — more dra- '
i matically—by the present necessity j

for federal relief and public works.
The time has come for a bold Con
stitutional change. It is the only
thing that will really save the Con- ,
stitution of the United States from !
destruction.

i widespread employment of child

i "cut-throat" competitive practices
j making it increasingly impossible

Those circumstances still hold

When the Constitution was drafted

I fully adequate to the economic sit—
I uation of the day. But as industry

j ment continues to mount, the Con- |
stitution—unless amended—will un- '
dergo a process of progressive emas

J the machine age.
NRA has indicated both the evils
and the necessity for federal regu- !
, lation. With the experience of NRA
behind them, the leaders of the na- i
tion would do well to draft a Const i
j tutional amendment allowing the
central government to extend its

j field, and providing at the same time j
| against usurpation of legislative
prerogatives by the national execu- !
i tive. Particularly if economic condi- j
: tions continue as bad as they are, the !
I amendment would have an excellent
| chance of passage.
Such a move of course would ;
| drastically alter the traditional !
| federal-state set-up of the United :
i States government. But the present
! depression has indicated above all j
J else that the individual states cannot j
j take care of themselves. State sov- |
ereignty is gradually being under- j
; mined by the expansion of the na- ;
, tional economy, and — more dra- '
i matically—by the present necessity j

for federal relief and public works.
The time has come for a bold Con
stitutional change. It is the only
thing that will really save the Con- ,
stitution of the United States from !

NRA—sired by the United States
| Chamber of Commerce, mothered by
I Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and
godfathered by General Hugh S.
[ Johnson—has been declared uncon
| stitutional by the Supreme Court of
i the United States. NRA was born of
' an earnest desire to put men back
' to work and take America out of
] depression. But the Supreme Court
i holds that "earnest desire" is not
j sufficient warrant for (1) the Con
j gress to delegate its powers to any
I other branch of the government, or
j (2) for the federal government to
| attempt the regulation of intrastate
I commerce.
I
i Aside from the fact th;il NRA had
I not achieved its major objective—
I i.e., to raise wages and increase em
| ployment on a wholesale scale—the
! Blue Eagle mechanism had been at-
I tacked for months on the grounds
: that it was, in fact, unconstitutional,
| and that it constituted bureaucratic
I regimentation of business. It is to
the shame of the present adminis
| tration that it dodged a test of NRA's
constitutionality until the present
| moment. But now that the uncon
i stitutionality of the "recovery"
measure has been authoritatively
settled, there still remains the very
important question of whether the
central government should under
any circumstances attempt to control
business with a view toward a plan
ned economy.
Putting aside the specific manner
in which the Democratic adminis
tration has attempted to control
business, we believe that there yet
exists a crying need for a greater
control over industrial enterprise
than at present exists. The circum
stances which gave rise to a neces
sity for NRA or some form of large
| scale control of business were un
; planned and often irrational pro-
I duction, resulting in waste and glut
| of the market; disregard of the ne
! cessity for keeping consumer pur
i chasing power in step with produc
! tion and prices; "sweating" of labor;
i widespread employment of child
' labor resulting in lowered wage
| scales and fewer jobs for adults, and
| of the gradual undermining of the
; health and educational require
ments of the rising generation; and
i "cut-throat" competitive practices
j making it increasingly impossible
j for honest men to stay in business.
Those circumstances still hold
; sway. And though the Supreme
j Court has declared that the fed
eral government lacks the power to
j control those conditions, the eco
; nomic evils that plunged us into de
pression yet remain to plague the

I body politic. If those evils are not
j cured, we must resign ourselves to
further depression, further suffer
ing, further poverty in the land of
j the greatest plenty.
Experience has demonstrated that
i industry will not regulate itself in
| enlightened fashion (insofar as the
i public is concerned). The states—as
: individual units—laek the unanimity
!of purpose, the breadth of vision,
I and the co-ordinating mechanisms
| to regulate an economic system that
is national in scope. The only hope
for the rationalizing of mass pio-
I duction and mass distribution lies in
