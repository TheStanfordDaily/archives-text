• Wally Brooke in defeating Jim Triolo
and Ken Livingston for the office of
A.S.S.U. President followed the platform
of a closer relation between students and
faculty. This, he says, should lead to a
more successful formulation of general
campus interests. More desirable and less
unwanted objects may be gained, he
thinks, by such an administration. The
campus stands by. . . . Bob Gros does
not at present seem to want for employ
ment. He is Debate Manager and a mem
ber of the Men's Council now and has
been named as Graduate Member of the
Ex Committee and Student Manager of
the A.S.S.U. for next year. Cros will
probably resign from his position on Ex
Committee and will devote his time to
Student Manager next year.
