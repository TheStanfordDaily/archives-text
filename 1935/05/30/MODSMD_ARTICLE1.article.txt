## Follies' Features Many In Tomorrow Night's Performance BILL ROGERS APPEARS Masque Ball King Dances In Burlesque Finale 
### Anna Ice Whitmore 
Everything from a juggling act to
a men's chorus will be featured in
tomorrow night's "Follies Bour
geois," according to last minute
plans. Ticket sale proceeds, mean
while, in A.S.S.U. offices for 25, 50,
and 75 cents.
Much practice has resulted in
one of "the greatest juggling acts
of all time." Waldo Salt, hereto
fore respectable dramatist and au
thor, will present the "world
shaking" performance after weeks
of painstaking effort.
Bill Rogers, ex-Ex Committee
ncmber, and Dave Mellinkoff, writ
r of "Bull Session," teamed last
juarter to win debate trophies. For
he Follies, they have not only writ
en much of the continuity in col
laboration, but also will appear in
person in a "Gallagher and Shean"
skit.
Copp Tickles Ivories
Jim Copp, star of past Gaieties, is
to appear in one of his well-known
"Pianologues," guaranteed to out-
Copp even his "Scrambled Egg Solo."
A men's chorus will contribute
something new in dancing in the
"Governor's Lane" number.
George Z. Wilson, Phil Brown.
James Corner, and Robert Ran
viime are the men who claim to
have out-Ziegfelded Ziegfeld.
"The Gate," a dramatic poem, will
be read by Annelies Morgan. Miss
Morgan is well-known for her parts
in campus readings and for other
dramatic work.
Mack Gordon Plays
George Wilson and Jean Hay have
planned an eccentric dance which,
says Dick Frank, will be the high
spot of the show. Mack Gordon will
play Fome of his own compositions
on a midget piano in the cabaret
scene. Another specialty will be
Janet Richter, appearing as featured
dancer, and Norman Sears singing
"Just for You."
Virginia Wilson and Pete Peck
will ba spotlighted in "Governor's
Lane" and "Who Gives a Darn.
Both have sung in Gaieties, and
both are experienced actors.
Jack Walton Dances
One of the high spots of the eve
ning is promised when Jack Walton
and Harriette Hall Kilby burlesque
Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers' re
cent dances in motion pictures in a
grand climax called "The Element
al." Fred Nagel, Pete Knecht and
Stan Brent form a trio which con
tributes songs in the "Elemental
finale.
"If you think Walton was good as
Masque Ball king," warns Manager
Frank, "you should see him in the
'Elemental'!"
