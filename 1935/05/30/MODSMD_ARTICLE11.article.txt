# F.D.H. STRIVES FOR SOLUTION OF PROBLEMS
## Many Business Men Assert Intention To Stick By NRA Codes 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 29 (TP). —
President Roosevelt closely scru
i tinized the reaction of industry and
j the public tonight as, with scores of
| advisers, he strove to reduce the
i chaotic aftermath of NRA's destruc
| tion to an orderly plan of procedure.
Breaking his silence for the first
I time since the Supreme Court killed
: the Blue Eagle, he told newspaper
] correspondents that far more im
| portant than what is happening in
j Washington were the immediate
, consequences of the decision
| throughout American industry.
On his desk, he said, were nu
| ini-rous assertions by various code
j groups and trade associations of
! an intention to stock by the codes
, until new legislation could be
1 formulated. He added, however,
i that Cut-throat tactics by a mi-
I nority in those industries could
j disrupt the whole scheme.
Of more than 75 business men,
! lawyers and editors, whom the Pres
i ident said he had consulted, one of
• the outstanding figures was General
I Hugh S. Johnson, original leader of
, NRA, whose vigorous tactics and
j biting epithetcs pushed the blue
j eagle agency to its former high place
i in popular prestige.
Johnson hurried to Washington
with, it was understood, a plan for
' a voluntary system of codes with
| the Federal Trade Commission em
i powered to lift antitrust law restric
i tions in certain cases. Mr. Roose
i vclt emphasized Johnson was but
lone of 30 with an intimate knowl
j edge of NRA who had been advis
\ ing him. Professor Felix Frankfur
ter of the Harvard law school, a
frequent Roosevelt adviser, accom
panied the former NRA chief.
In addition to the plan attrib
uted to Johnson, similar in some
i respects to one advanced by
! Chairman Harrison of the Senate
I Finance Committee, there was
I growing speculation on the pos
sibility that strong forces would
get behind a constitutional amend
; mcnt removing the reefs on which
' NRA foundered.
Mr. Roosevelt said this had been
i.suggested to him together with
many other proposals ranging from
I the abolishment of the Supreme
j Court to the abolishment of Con
-1 gress and even, he added with a
| chuckle, the elimination of the
President himself.
The President's remarks, for the
' most part cryptic and enigmatic,
were delivered at his regular press
j conference. It had been announced
that lie would not answer questions
|on NRA, and once he refused. Bui.
I when a reporter inquired as to the
! threatened coal strike, he changed
| his intention.

That, he said, was much like many
other problems created by the Su
preme Court's invalidation of NRA.
But, he continued, the real news did
not lie in Washington but through
out the cities, towns, and communi
ties which make up the nation.
