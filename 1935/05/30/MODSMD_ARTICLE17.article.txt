# WEYERHAEUSER BOY SOUGHT IN SAN FRANCISCO
## Police Search Hotels After Kidnaped Lad Alleged Seen in Cafe 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, May 29 (/pi.â€”
Purely on the strength of "possibili
ties," police today launched a thor
ough search of hotels and rooming '
houses in the vicinity of the small
down-town restaurant where a
youth described as bearing striking
resemblance to the kidnaped George !
Philip Weyerhaeuser was seen in!
company with a man.
Crime prevention detail officers
Frank Lucy and William Merrick
were told by 11. B. Clark, who
said he was a writer of legal trea
tises, he had seen a lad wearing a
tan leather jacket, blue knickers
and blue sox, accompanied by a
man, breakfasting in a small res
taurant today.
His suspicions were aroused, Clark
said, when he recalled newspaper
pictures of the missing Tacoma youth
and noticed the striking similarity
with the boy in the restaurant, whom
he had first seen yesterday at the
same place and with the same man.
Intending to talk to the boy,
Clark walked over to him and
prepared to ask who he was when
he was tapped on the shoulder by
' the man beside the youth and told
to "mind your own business."
At that, Clark said, he walked back
!to his seat. The man grasped the
i lad's hand and departed from the
: lunch room in haste.
Police were notified immediately
j and a squad of officers detailed to
, the scene. The pair had disappeared,
! however, and the search then turned
i to neighborhood hotels and rooming
i houses.
