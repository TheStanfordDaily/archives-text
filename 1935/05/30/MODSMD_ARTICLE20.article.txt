# Pyramids Predict End of Depression, Says Student
## 
### PHIL BERNHEIM 
The end of the depression in 1936
I can be predicted from an ancient
! Egyplian pyramid built in 2144 8.C.!
j That is the startling belief of George
j Grinnell, Stanford sophomore.
Grinnell and Waller Dowdy, Palo
Alto pyramidologist, claim to have
found in the construction of the
' Great Pyramid a record of the his
i tory of mankind and a means of
j predicting its future. The two have
| taken up the work of Piazzi Smythe,
i late Astronomer Royal of Scotland,
I where he left it at the time of his
i death.
Smythe in his writings claimed
i that it was possible to attach pro
j phetic meanings to the interior of
' the Great Pyramid. Ho saw in it a
[ religious history of the world, espe
| cially as affecting Great Britain.
The "historic line" of the main
1 shaft traces thr history of mankind
I from its biblical beginnings in 4000
B.C. up to the present, with signifi
j car.t markings indicating the con
struction of the pyramid in 2144 8.C.,

the birth of Christ in 4 8.C., the dis
covery of America, the turn of the
present century (which evidently is
of cspecial significance to Great
Britain), the World War, and the
present depression.
Smythe predicted the World War
as "four years of calamityâ€”God's
yvrath visited upon the earlh." Grin
nell has found markings which he
claims show the beginnings of the
present depression in 1928 and sets
September 16 of next year, 1936, as
the end of the current difficulties.
Grinnell claims a previous suc
cess in prophecy to back his predic
tion. He foretold the coming into
power of Adolf Hitler from features
of the pyramid's construction. "I
arrived at this conclusion over three
weeks before he became dictator,"
said Grinnell.
The illness of King George a few
years ago was another accurate pre
diction of Smythe, whose beliefs
were ridiculed by his contemporaries
but have since pro\ed sound.
