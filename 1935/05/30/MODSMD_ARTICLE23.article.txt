# Kahn,Cave Get Binder Ad Job
## 
### 
A.S.S.U. President Marvie Kahn j
and Student Manager Ben Cave will ]
continue in their old A.S.S.U. twin i
'act this summer, it was revealed
yesterday by A1 Masters, when he
awarded them the managership of
the much-discussed binder divider
activity.
Binder dividers are the cardboard j
inserts containing advertising that j
are distributed free to students at the
I beginning of every year.
I Because it is supposed to take
I away advertising from campus pub
lications, the proceeds of the activ
ity will go partly to the managers,
! partly to the campus publications,
I partly to the A.S.S.U., which con
jtrols the binder divider monopoly. .
