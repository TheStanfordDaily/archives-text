NEW YORK, May 29 (/Pi. â€” The
Canadian government's quest for
power to revalue gold was seen in
Wall Street today as a step in prepa
ration for possible international sta
| bilization of currencies later.
I It was pointed out that the
i Canadian dollar has depreciated
I along with the American dollar as
j the United States did in reference
i to the American dollar in January,
i 1934.
With power to revalue gold, the
government would be free to put
j the Canadian dollar back on a gold
basis when it felt conditions fa-
I vored.
