# In the Union There Is Said to Be Truth

"The existing budget not to exceed *90 for
advertising in the Stamobi) Daij.y will be con
tinued with the understanding that upon pub
lication in the Daily of any matter derogatory
to the I'nion which is not true, the agreement
for said advertising shall be canceled."
It is hard to believe that the above statement
was actually made, carried, and written into
the minutes <>l the I'nion Hoard of Governors,
li is hard to believe, because tlie members of
this board are mature, experienced people
who would never be expected to come through
with anything even approaching the absurdity
of such a statement.
11, during the year, legitimate campus opin
ions are printed which relied to the discredit
Â«j I the I'nion, who is to be the judge of whether
such "matter" is derogatory, or whether it is
"true"? Who is qualified to pass on truth,
when truth may only be a person's personal
opinion?
Perhaps next year, a sentence in the Daily
might possibly remark upon the fact that the
food in the I'nion was not very well prepared
during a specific meal. If the I'nion directors
had eaten said food without any ill elVeels, it
might be well said that the statement consti
tuted a falsehood, and the advertising con
tract broken. Still, the remark about non
well prepared food might very well be so,
although the directors were unaware of this
fact after eating so much I'nion food that
I hey were in no proper condition to judge.
In other words, the statement sounds like
a very huge joker. Anyway, we'll charitably
lake il to mean that.
