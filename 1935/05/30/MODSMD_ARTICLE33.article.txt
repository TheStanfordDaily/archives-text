It seems that men in semi-formal attire
wear shoes m good deal heavier than men clad
in cords, sweaters, et cetera. Shades of Dr.
Dyment arise. The women's dance studio
again comes into prominence.
This time il seems that the seniors cannot
have the use of the dance studio for their
Senior Prom, because the heavy hoofs of the
worn-out graduating class will leave such an
indelible imprint upon the waxed lloor ol the
studio that the women will not bo able lo do
their barefoot dancing on the scarred remains
of the lloor when the senior, function is over.
All of which is ;i bit stale reasoning. The
pool- termite-ridden Dance Studio has gotten
along very well in fact, exceptionally well
since its construction. It still appears to be
in very much excellent shape, despite the
many dances held within it. To assume that
three or four hours of dancing would really
ruin the floors is hard to believe.
Aside from all this, the five hundred seniors
have probably helped to finance Ihe building
lo some small degree during the last four
years, when they have written out chocks for
Mir> each quarter. And finally, the spectacle
of the Senior Prom being held in the Women's
Gym, along with Hoble jollv-ups, is enough to
lax the patience ol any high-minded senior.
