# Stanford Pauses Today
## 
### 
Today the nation will pause with bowed
head lor one brief moment in silent prayer
to the memory of those who "died that the
nation might live." Stanford, however, in her
casual and carefree manner will nonchalantly
go to classes in the usual Thursday morning
custom.
As far as the Hough is concerned, Memo
rial Day has little meaning 110 vacation, just
another day of the month until he thinks
hack to campus days of eighteen years ago.
He forgets those scores of similar Stanford
men who in 11)17 went to war, regardless of
the issues al stake, and of those scores who
died in France.
But like the rest of the nation, Stanford
will awaken from daily Thursday routine
and will pause in honor of those Houghs who
eighteen years ago took the same lackadaisical
attitude until they were called on to entrain
for Franceâ€”and death.
