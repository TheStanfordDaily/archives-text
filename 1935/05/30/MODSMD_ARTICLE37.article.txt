As long as we have Democracy there is no use in
allowing people like Father Coughlin to use democratic
devices to destroy it. In his case the longer he talks
the sooner people will see what he Ls. Of course there
are other ways. Mr. Brisbane recalls that the monk
Savonarola, who resembles Father Coughlin in many
ways, was turned on by his followers and burned
alive. While that is no longer done, it would be just
as painful to Father Coughlin's ego to be shown up as
a liar, a cheat, and a hypocrite, and then given the
proper treatment.
II people like the Radio Priest succeed in get
ting what they are after, many things that men
have fought for and gotten will vanish overnight.
For more than a century and a half we have had
free speech, free press, free assembly, right of
petition, and government by the consent of the
governed. While times have changed greatly, by
and large Democracy has managed to keep up
with the changes. And in spite of Father Cough
lin's screechings, the vested interests have steadily
lost.
Capital and vested interests fought the income tax
40 years ago and won. But in 1916 the income tax be
came law. And in spite of dire predictions, things
went on as before and so did Democracy. .In the long
run, too, the farmer interests have prevailed against
the money interests. That conflict was one of the
causes of the Revolution; it brought Jackson into
power, it made and broke Bryan, but finally gave us
the Federal Reserve System, and now Governor Eccles
—certainly a victory for the common man. Labor
unions, too, have risen from the status of conspiracies
to something almost like a partnership with govern
ment and industry.
While some of these things have taken time,
they have been done. TlrM shows the elasticity of
democratic institutions. Under Democracy any
program of Social Justice—if it is wise—will pre
vail. The demagogs say the only way to get Social
Justice is to destroy Democracy. They are wrong.
If they get Social Justice by destroying Democ
racy there won't be any Justice left when they get
through. The only way to keep Democracy is by
destroying those who want to destroy it by using
its own devices.

While some of these things have taken time,
they have been done. TlrM shows the elasticity of
democratic institutions. Under Democracy any
program of Social Justice—if it is wise—will pre
vail. The demagogs say the only way to get Social
Justice is to destroy Democracy. They are wrong.
If they get Social Justice by destroying Democ
racy there won't be any Justice left when they get
through. The only way to keep Democracy is by
destroying those who want to destroy it by using
its own devices.
