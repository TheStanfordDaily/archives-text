It is surprising the cfl'ett that the weather has on
the advancement of science, geographic determinism
or no geographic determinism. By an odd coincidence,
every time the weather gets hot, the toys in the
Guggenheim Aeronautical lab have the wind tunnel
going.
The greatest number of walk-outs every year are
instigated by the hashers, who have to leave 11 o'clock
classes early in order to set up table for all the boys
and girls. It is a peculiarity, though, that toward the
end of the quarter the boys and girls have to be fed
earlier, and that the number of hashers increases by
phenomenal leaps and bounds.
Because of the subversive Union threat that they
will withdraw their $90 worth of advertising from
The Daily for any derogatory statements not based on
fact, we are afraid to quote this statement of a former
Union hasher, but he ought to know the truth. He
says: "Union food is cheap, yet inexpensive."
A story is going the rounds about one of our
pampered sons of noble line, who got measles and
wired the fact home to the folks in Los Angeles. He
had hardly laid down his telegraph key, when the
folks hopped out of an airplane with four doctors, an
ambulance, a Drinker respirator, and four pills. Every
round thai the story goes, the numbers increase. Pretty
soon it will be five doctors, five pills, two airplanes, and
two families. I don't believe a word of it.
The presses have been kept hot with the news that
four Stanford students were caught by a ranger on
Mt. Tamalpais while conducting ;in informal nudist
party 'Tis said that the ranger, who has a poetic
soul, has erected a sign in Potrero Meadows: "Folks in
ihe nude, not allewd."
