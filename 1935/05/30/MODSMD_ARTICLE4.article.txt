# Indian Trackmen Beach Boston, Work Out Today
## Four Aces All Must Enter Trials Tomorrow 
### Warren Breed 
Stanford's four 1.C.4-A. trackmen, I
jwilh California's 13 and U.C.L.A.'s j
i two, arrived in Boston yesterday lo
I get a little limbering up today and
j a good rest for the trials tomorrow.
| They worked out in the Cambridge
S Stadium yesterday.
All four Cards — Sammy Klop
stock, Jim Reynolds, Johnny Mot
tram, and Phil Levy—will have to
go into the qualifying trials to- j
morrow, with the grand finale set j
for Saturday afternoon.
Strong in Weights
With no definite news pro or con
concerning the Cards' condition, pre
| dictions still hold for several Stan
i ford wins—in the shot, hurdles, dis
j cus, and javelin.
As usual, the four California
j teams are expected to come through
i with the best performances, and run
j away with high team honors. S.C. !
jis the short-shot favorite to win
! hands down, with California and
| Stanford right up there for the next
| places.
Trojans Leading
This situation is only a repetition
lof the last dozen 1.C.4-A. meets.,
J Stanford has won three, U.C. three,
I and S.C. five, Yale being the only .
non-California aggregation to cop in !
that many years. Harvard is the j
strongest eastern power.
Peering into individual events, :
j this year's performances put the j
; western boys where they are fa- i
! voted to win at least 12 events. Then.
|with the scattering of seconds audi
i thirds, Troy is counting on massing
; its 20-man team into piling up an j
! all-time high point score, although;
j California and Stanford men are
' threats to this plan.
Upsets May Occur
| Stanford's points arc also endan
gered by possible Troy or Bear up
! sets. Klopstock will have his old
i friends, Tom Moore of the Bears
I and Phil Cope of Troy, to beat in the
j highs, and, besides Moore, Strother
