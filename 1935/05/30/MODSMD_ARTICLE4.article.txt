# Indian Trackmen Beach Boston, Work Out Today
## Four Aces All Must Enter Trials Tomorrow 
### Warren Breed 
Stanford's four 1.C.4-A. trackmen, I
jwilh California's 13 and U.C.L.A.'s j
i two, arrived in Boston yesterday lo
I get a little limbering up today and
j a good rest for the trials tomorrow.
| They worked out in the Cambridge
S Stadium yesterday.
All four Cards — Sammy Klop
stock, Jim Reynolds, Johnny Mot
tram, and Phil Levy—will have to
go into the qualifying trials to- j
morrow, with the grand finale set j
for Saturday afternoon.
Strong in Weights
With no definite news pro or con
concerning the Cards' condition, pre
| dictions still hold for several Stan
i ford wins—in the shot, hurdles, dis
j cus, and javelin.
As usual, the four California
j teams are expected to come through
i with the best performances, and run
j away with high team honors. S.C. !
jis the short-shot favorite to win
! hands down, with California and
| Stanford right up there for the next
| places.
Trojans Leading
This situation is only a repetition
lof the last dozen 1.C.4-A. meets.,
J Stanford has won three, U.C. three,
I and S.C. five, Yale being the only .
non-California aggregation to cop in !
that many years. Harvard is the j
strongest eastern power.
Peering into individual events, :
j this year's performances put the j
; western boys where they are fa- i
! voted to win at least 12 events. Then.
|with the scattering of seconds audi
i thirds, Troy is counting on massing
; its 20-man team into piling up an j
! all-time high point score, although;
j California and Stanford men are
' threats to this plan.
Upsets May Occur
| Stanford's points arc also endan
gered by possible Troy or Bear up
! sets. Klopstock will have his old
i friends, Tom Moore of the Bears
I and Phil Cope of Troy, to beat in the
j highs, and, besides Moore, Strother
' and Hall of Troy in the? lows. Mot-
I tram will have to beat the two Bears
who took him down in the Big Meet,
I George Fink and Norm Fitzgerald.
Levy must beat Randall of Cali
i l'ornia and Carpenter of S.C. to win
1 the discus. Reynolds will have to
take Mackey of the Bears, whereas
if the Indians beat their Coast rivals
they should not have a great deal of
trouble with easterners.
West's Hurdlers Ilcst
The best eastern mark, for in
| stance, in the high hurdles, is 15
fiat. Eight or nine California col
legians have done better than that,
; so Klopstock, Moore, and Cope are
all by themselves as far as this
year's records go.
Reynolds and Levy are also far
I ahead of outsiders, Jim being 4 feet
! better than any non-Califomian in
; the shot, and Levy about 10 feet
! ahead in 1 lie discus. Mottram will
| have a little tougher time, for he
will be meeting last year's champ,
Horace Odell of Manhattan, who
I approached 220 feet last year.
Michigan Out of Meet
Michigan definitely declared itself
out of the running yesterday, so the
boys will not be bothered by the übi
quitious presence of Willis Ward.
Both Ward and Jesse Owens, the
Ohio State negro, are waiting for
the N.C.2-A. at Berkeley next
month to see what they can do
against the best in the West.
