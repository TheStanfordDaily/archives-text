"THE INFORMER"
At the Stanford Theater
This picture is noteworthy in that
it represents a step toward a new
source of plot, is an exhibition of
superb photography, and affords
Victor McLaglen of comedy fame, a
chance to prove himself an intelli
gent actor of serious drama.
The plot concerns the revolution
ary factions as existing in Ireland

before the es
tablishment of
th e Irish Free
State. It is im
portant inas
much as it fur
nishes the situa
tions in which
"th e informer"

is enmeshed. Mr. McLaglen plays
the moronic Gybo pathetically, and
with an animal-like brutality that
leaves the audience in sympathy
with this unfortunate victim of
heredity and circumstance.
The picture, which lasts almost
two hours, is a slow and depressing
unraveling of plot. Melodramatic
stage tricks are inserted which will
either be taken in with the rest of
this unusual story, or will leave one
wondering as to the place this ve
hicle should occupy in the season's
offerings.
