"Bolero," "About a Quarter to
Nine," and "Look Who's Here" are
three of the numbers to be played

THE GENTLE ART of throat cut
ting: NBC quietly started to clean
up their program and advertising
standards over a year ago, but Co
lumbia grabbed all the favorable
publicity with their recent an
nouncement of a similar policy and
NBC is now the unjust recipient of a
lot of "why don't you do likewise"
letters.
the supporting cast mediocre, but
the lines are clever, the situations
amusing, and if you're a Boland-
Ruggles fan, you'll enjoy this one.
