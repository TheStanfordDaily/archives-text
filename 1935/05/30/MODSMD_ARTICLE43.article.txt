# BULL SESSION
## THE 						FORTY-FIVE DOLLAR DIDDLE 
### 
Having 900ked (he A.S.S.U.'s goose |
and eaten it, Ex Committee —well ''
.•■pattered with the gravy of their
toils—lick their chops, and with
avaricious good nature anticipate
the forthcoming Ex Committee
dance.
It took a big issue like the "Forty
five Dollar Diddle" to awaken Ex 1
Committee from its legislative slum
ber. You could tell Ex Committee
it was inefficient —and that would
not bother it. You could tell Ex 1
Committee it was trivial — and its
calm would not be ruffled. But just
tell Ex Committee that you do not ,
think it entitled to $45 of student
money, and committee springs into
action, like a wounded lioness in
defense of her cubs. The simile im
probably a poor one, for the lioness
is motivated by altruism.
We had not realized until now the
extent to which Congressional mor
als had permeated the Stanford
governing council. But Ex Commit
tee's defense of the "Forty-five Dol
lar Diddle" indicates that its back
scratching and log rolling is only
less gigantic than that of the United
States Congress because Ex Com- i
mittee has less money to deal with.
Ex Committee (with the exception of
the A.S.S.U. president) felt that
j since everyone else was "getting
theirs," there was no good reason
why it too should not share in the
plunder. That is real statesman
ship. Or again, Ex Committee felt
that 3 cents an hour was not ex
cessive pay.
If Ex Committee chooses to con
sider the $45 in the nature of a
' salary grab," one can but marvel at
committee's restraint. However —if
Ex Committee, with the A.S.S.U.
1 treasury at its disposal, decides to
pay itself, and then only hires itself
at the rates of 3 cents an hour, Ex
i Committeemen must be classed as
"slave labor," or else very inferior
labor. The truth of the matter is
that Ex Committee positions are po-
I sitions of honor and of some pres
j tige. And that honor, and that pres-
I tige should be sufficient compensa-
I tion for service rendered to the stu
dent body.
One cannot but be amazed at the
i

attitude of Ex Committee through
out the whole procedure. Having
first decreed that there should be no
dances because of the measles, Ex
Committee set about to find ways
and means of evading the spirit of
its own ruling. Hoping to hold the
dance before the close of school, Ex
Committee even considered a pro
posal to hold the dance in the name
of a private member, in order that
the dance would not come under the
heading of a "student body func
tion." And that Ls real statesman
ship.
Now, Ex Committee having had
its banquet insists that it yet have a
dance. Why? Because there yet re
mains a part of the $45 budgeted for
Ex Committee fun. Save the stu
dents' money? Certainly not.
The ethical standards which have

prompted the "Fort>*-five Dollar
Diddle" will not soon be forgotten

the forthcoming Ex Committee
dance.
It took a big issue like the "Forty
five Dollar Diddle" to awaken Ex 1
Committee from its legislative slum
ber. You could tell Ex Committee
it was inefficient —and that would
not bother it. You could tell Ex 1
Committee it was trivial — and its
calm would not be ruffled. But just
tell Ex Committee that you do not ,
think it entitled to $45 of student
money, and committee springs into
action, like a wounded lioness in
defense of her cubs. The simile im
probably a poor one, for the lioness
is motivated by altruism.
We had not realized until now the
extent to which Congressional mor
als had permeated the Stanford
governing council. But Ex Commit
tee's defense of the "Forty-five Dol
lar Diddle" indicates that its back
scratching and log rolling is only
less gigantic than that of the United
States Congress because Ex Com- i
mittee has less money to deal with.
Ex Committee (with the exception of
the A.S.S.U. president) felt that
j since everyone else was "getting
theirs," there was no good reason
why it too should not share in the
plunder. That is real statesman
ship. Or again, Ex Committee felt
that 3 cents an hour was not ex
cessive pay.
If Ex Committee chooses to con
sider the $45 in the nature of a
' salary grab," one can but marvel at
committee's restraint. However —if
Ex Committee, with the A.S.S.U.
1 treasury at its disposal, decides to
pay itself, and then only hires itself
at the rates of 3 cents an hour, Ex
i Committeemen must be classed as
"slave labor," or else very inferior
labor. The truth of the matter is
that Ex Committee positions are po-
I sitions of honor and of some pres
j tige. And that honor, and that pres-
I tige should be sufficient compensa-
I tion for service rendered to the stu
dent body.
One cannot but be amazed at the
i

attitude of Ex Committee through
out the whole procedure. Having
first decreed that there should be no
dances because of the measles, Ex
Committee set about to find ways
and means of evading the spirit of
its own ruling. Hoping to hold the
dance before the close of school, Ex
Committee even considered a pro
posal to hold the dance in the name
of a private member, in order that
the dance would not come under the
heading of a "student body func
tion." And that Ls real statesman
ship.
Now, Ex Committee having had
its banquet insists that it yet have a
dance. Why? Because there yet re
mains a part of the $45 budgeted for
Ex Committee fun. Save the stu
dents' money? Certainly not.
The ethical standards which have

prompted the "Fort>*-five Dollar
Diddle" will not soon be forgotten

Having 900ked (he A.S.S.U.'s goose |
