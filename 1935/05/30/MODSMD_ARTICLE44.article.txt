# Thousands Mass For Opening of San Diego Fair
## Roosevelt Address Starts Exposition Officially 
### 
SAN DIEGO, May 29 (/P).—'Twen
ty-five thousand persons, some of
whom had started their vigil outside
the gates at dawn, moved in on the
California Pacific International Ex
position today when the gates swung
open shortly before noon.
The unofficial opening ceremony
somehow missed fire with Frank
Belcher, Jr., president of the World's
Fair Board, absent when the ap
pointed hour arrived when a color
guard and band, under command of
Captain F. I. Fenton of the Sixth
United States Marines, marched
through the portals down the Ave
nida de Palacios for the flag-raising
ceremonies.
Thousands Flood Park
On the heels of the blue-coated
squad rushed the awaiting thou
sands through the turnstiles of the
east and west entrances, soon to
flood the 300 acres of architectural
and landscaping beauty for a peek
at. the story of advancement dating
back to 1542 when Juan Rodriguez
Cabrillo set foot on land here in the
name of Spain.
By strange paradox, an elderly
man and woman earned the honor
of stepping inside the gates of Bal
boa Park, to see an exposition dedi
cated to youth and the future.
F.D.R. To Speak
While the day was given over to
a long series of ceremonies, the cli
max will be saved until 8 o'clock
tonight (Pacific Standard Time)
when President Franklin D. Roose
velt officially opens the exposition
with a short address transmitted to
the throngs here over a public ad
dress system by direct wire from
Washington, D.C.
At his instigation two orphan ohi 1-»
dren will press the button which will
flood the grounds with a soft iri
descent glow reflecting off the white
Spanish buildings and through the
trees and shrubbery of the pictu
resque park.
Afternoon Dedication
The afternoon program was given
over to dedication, first of the $125,-
000 Federal Building, bringing to the
limelight Secretary of Commerce
Daniel Roper and Undersecretary of
State William Phillips, and the Cali
fornia State Building, with Governor
Frank E. Merriam making the pres
entation to the fair.
Flag raising ceremonies in the
morning were brief, as the Marine
color guard hoisted the star-span
gled banner over the Arco del Por
venir—arch of the future—while the
early stragglers stood by with bared
heads as the national anthem was
played and the colors slowly raised.
"Crash'' Frustrated
The opening was not without its
untoward incident. Several hundred
persons attempted to crash through
the Eleventh Avenue gate but were
frustrated when a police radio patrol
answered an urgent call and dis
persed the crowd.
Accompanying the morning pro
gram was a national radio broad
cast, opened by a blast from the
whistle of the S.S. Normandie, 6000
miles away en route to America from
France on its maiden voyage. Then
the controls were switched to the
exposition grounds where ancient
mission bells were tolled and a
mixed chorus sang "Old Mission
Bells." .
Radio Description
A panoramic description over a
national network from the California
tower followed, carrying through it
the story of this, the Far West's first
pueblo, from the founding of the
first mission here in 17G9 by Fra
Junipero Serra.
Music from the Ford Symphony
Orchestra, the huge outdoor pipe
organ, and a group of Spanish trou
badours also went into the program.
