# Library Plans Extension Of Photo-Filming Service

### CEDRIC LARSON 
Stanford Library, as well as other |
leading libraries of the United States
and Europe, is now considering the ,
extension of their files of public doc
uments, newspapers and maps, by
means of photo-filming.
Nathan van Patten, director of
libraries, believes' that while this
method of preserving important rec
ords is still in its infancy, it may de
velop into a science of considerable j
proportions as technique and equip
ment are perfected.
Newspaper Problem
The librarian points out that news- !
papers, printed on extremely perish
able ground wood-pulp paper, offer
a distinct preservation problem.
Newspapers, besides, are very bulky, '
and furnish a storage problem.
A movie-film, on the other hand, i
can easily be taken of a whole series
of newspaper files and requires a
negligible amount of storage space.
At present research men are work
ing to produce cellulose-acetate
films, both photographic image and
film medium, of greater stability, and
methods of preserving them.

| Dr. Max Savelle of the history de
| partment has had considerable suc
j cess i.n carrying on pioneer work
along this line in the "dark room"
of the Stanford library, where he
uses the powerful Leitz-Wetzler
projector in reading movie films of
rare documents in European libra
] ries, which bear on the new book he
is writing: "The Treaty of Paris,
j 1763."
A picture of Dr. Savelle at work
with this machine is found in Wed
nesday's photolithic section. A per
j feet image of the book page is thrown
on the screen directly in front of the
I professor from the film strip above.
Books Duplicated
Photostat reproductions of any de
sired size can be made from these
j film strips, and a library can dupli
| cate copies of rare books and news
papers in this manner at compara
i tively small cost.
This method of research as well
' saves thousands of miles of travel to
i the investigator, who can order a
movie-film of the rare book he
wishes, whether it be in another sec
' tion of America or Europe.
