## Protests Presented Against Anti-Japanese Action 
### 
TOKYO, May 29 (A*).— Japanese
military domination of all North
j China today apparently was fore
! shadowed in Rengo (Japanese) news
! agency dispatches from Peiping,
I which said Japanese Army officers
j there had demanded China's imme
j diate settlement of 14 disputed
j points.
The list of demands was said to
| have been presented in connection
I with stern protests against alleged
j anti-Japanese movements in the
i Peiping and Tientsin regions and
i warning that such activity must
| cease.
Dispatch Not Official
A war office spokesman here,
I shown the dispatch, said it "incor-
I reetly described" what had happened
! at Peiping, but the Rengo advices
j said the Chinese had been warned
I Japan's military forces in Man
| churia might be forced to move
| south unless anti-Japanese senti
-1 ment were stilled.
Dispatches from Shanghai quoted
j Rengo as saying Chinese authorities
j had been advised that "the Japanese
j army may be obliged to place Peip
ing and Tientsin within the demili
! tarized zone as most anti-Japanese
j activities in North China are orig
| inating in the two cities."
j Rengo's Peiping correspondent,
j however, said the Japanese had as
! serted another punitive expedition
would be south from Manchuria un
j less anti-Japanfese terrorism in
North China ended quickly.
Disputed Points
He said the 14 points, existence of
i which could not be confirmed offi
| cially either in Peiping or Tokyo,
! included these:
| 1. Immediate dismissal of Gen.
Yu Hsueh-Chung, chairman of the
| provincial government at Hopei,
whom the Japanese early this month
! accused of moving troops into the
demilitarized zone.
2. Obtaining of Japanese consent
before appointing principal Chinese
officials in North China.
3. Abolition of the Peiping military
committee.
4. Withdrawal of all Kuomintang
(National Government Party) or
ganizations from North China.
Indications that the Japanese
a-rmy was ready to deal firmly with
North China were strengthened by
the fact that Lieut.-Gen. Yoshijiro
Umezu, commandant of Japanese
j garrisons in North China, went to
i Manchuria Wednesday and con
ferred with Gen. Senjuro Hayashi,
j Japanese war minister now touring
i Manchukuo.

! agency dispatches from Peiping,
I which said Japanese Army officers
j there had demanded China's imme
j diate settlement of 14 disputed
j points.
The list of demands was said to

I with stern protests against alleged
j anti-Japanese movements in the
i Peiping and Tientsin regions and
i warning that such activity must
| cease.
Dispatch Not Official
A war office spokesman here,
I shown the dispatch, said it "incor-
I reetly described" what had happened
! at Peiping, but the Rengo advices
j said the Chinese had been warned
I Japan's military forces in Man

Dispatches from Shanghai quoted
j Rengo as saying Chinese authorities
j had been advised that "the Japanese
j army may be obliged to place Peip
ing and Tientsin within the demili
! tarized zone as most anti-Japanese
j activities in North China are orig

j Rengo's Peiping correspondent,
j however, said the Japanese had as

would be south from Manchuria un
j less anti-Japanfese terrorism in
North China ended quickly.
Disputed Points
He said the 14 points, existence of
i which could not be confirmed offi
| cially either in Peiping or Tokyo,
! included these:
| 1. Immediate dismissal of Gen.
Yu Hsueh-Chung, chairman of the
| provincial government at Hopei,
whom the Japanese early this month
! accused of moving troops into the
demilitarized zone.
2. Obtaining of Japanese consent
before appointing principal Chinese
officials in North China.
3. Abolition of the Peiping military
committee.
4. Withdrawal of all Kuomintang
(National Government Party) or
ganizations from North China.
Indications that the Japanese
a-rmy was ready to deal firmly with
North China were strengthened by
the fact that Lieut.-Gen. Yoshijiro
Umezu, commandant of Japanese
j garrisons in North China, went to
i Manchuria Wednesday and con
ferred with Gen. Senjuro Hayashi,
j Japanese war minister now touring
i Manchukuo.
