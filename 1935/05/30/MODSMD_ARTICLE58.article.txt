PUBLIC HUMILIATION
The Editor, Sir:
In Tuesday's edition of The Daily
you printed a Campus Opinion which
protested against the public humilia
tion of two students by a professor,
who refused them admittance to his
class because they were a few min
utes late.
Yesterday the same professor pub
licly humiliated another student in a
different class, this time for glancing
at the headlines of .the morning
paper. Net content with merely
calling the attention of some 200 fel
low students to the offense, the pro
fessor pointed out the student spe
cifically by seat number.
Granted that it is in no way com
mendable to appear late for classes
or to read the paper during lecture,
are the high-school tactics employed
by this university professor any
more to be recommended? It seems
unfortunate that some college lec
turers should be unable to hold
the attention or interest of their
classes except through such artificial
means as compulsory attendance and
public ridicule.
Sincerely yours,
S. B.
