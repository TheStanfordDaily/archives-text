# Vocations Book Edited by Wrenn Out Next Week
## 
### 
Bearing a two-fold purpose of
outlining the curricula offered by
the various schools and depart
ments of the University, and sug
gesting vocational opportunities
thereby made possible* a 74-page
bulletin entitled "University Train
ing and Vocational Outlets," will
come oc the University Press early
next week and will be available at
the Information window in the
Registrar's office.
Lectures Summarized
The bulletin comprises a sum
mary of the vocational guidance
lecture series given in 1934 and 1935
by representatives of each school
and department of the University.
Four pages are devoted to each lec
ture, outlining current trends in that
particular field of study, the schol
astic training programs in effect at
Stanford, and the vocational out
lets for graduates with such study.
Entering freshmen have desig
nated that approximately 50 per
cent of them have no vocational
goal. Students will be assisted by
this bulletin to make an intelligent
choice of a major field of study
within the University, and of a voca
tional goal harmonious with such
training.
Thus the bulletin supplements the
opportunities given in the lower di
vision program in sampling the dif
ferent fields of knowledge in the
three broad fields of natural sci
ence, social science, and letters.
Vocation Index
A cross-index of the various vo
cations represented or mentioned
within the pages forms a feature of
the new publication. Aside from the
lectures themselves, the questions
and answers given during the series
are included, besides four selected
references on each particular sub
ject for further reading.
Dr. C. Gilbert Wrenn, assistant
registrar and director of guidance,
edited the bulletin which was pub
lished under the direction of the
Vocational Guidance Committee. A
service charge of 15 cents per copy
is made.
