# Gridders To Finish Spring Scrimmages In Game Saturday
## Thornhill Picks Teams For Contest in Stadium; Ends Injured 
### Gordon Frost 
Things are going to be popping in
the Stanford Stadium Saturday
when Tiny Thornhill sends two
picked teams of Indian gridders
against each other as the wind-up of
spring practice activities. The kick
off is scheduled for 2 o'clock. Ad
mission will be free.
For the past two months Tiny
has run his men through weekly
scrimmages, sessions that proved
to he h'Mig-up battles between In
dian varsity aspirants. Saturday's
affair will he the first time those
men get a chance to show their
wares before an audience.
About 50 men will be in uniform,
and during the course of the after
noon most of them will see action
in the game, which will be slightly
shorter than the regulation contest.
First and third quarters will last 12
minutes each and second and fourth
10 minutes.
An epidemic of injuries has cen
tered itself on the ends recently,
and as a consequence we find Monk
Moscrip, Keith Topping, Berneth
Layer, Carl Schott, and Alex Trom
pas laid up with bruises of one kind
or another. Bob Mangan, recently
shifted from end to tackle, and Ray
Todd, substitute fullback, will also
be on the sidelines.
Thornhill announced tentative
line-ups last night which will prob
ably undergo many a change before
game time Saturday.
