## University Title Aspirants Led by Rogers, Beal 
### 
Tomorrow afternoon on the High
way Turf, teams captained by Bill
Rogers and Carl Beal will battle for
the Colonel Cubbison Trophy, em
blematic of University polo cham
pionship.
Rogers' team won its way into
the finals by taking a 2-1 decision
over Bob Fullerton's team. Beal's
outfit defeated Jim Henderson's
team :Â»-2.
Starting with Rogers will b:- Jim
Coffin, Charles Christin, and Bob
Niccolls. Beal will receive support
fiom Ed McKeon, Don McAusland.
and Charles Baird.
The preliminaries were played
over a four-chukker route, but the
final tomorrow will be ol the usual
six-chukker length. The first games
showed plenty in the way of de
fense with none of the big guns do
ing much scoring. Tomorrow will
bring together two of the best shots
on the squad, Rogers and Beal, and
with them will be men who have
played, if at all, in second-string en
counters. What is lacking in team
play should be made up for by the
individual brilliance of the two cap
tains.
