## ONE LAST WORD ABOUT TRACK 
### 
Since tomorrow's paper is the last
to roll off the presses before The
Daily will bolt its doors and call it
quits for spring of 1935, this might
be a good time to do a little specu
lating on Stanford's track chances
for the remainder of the season.
First of all, the 1.C.4-A.'s at Bos
ton tomorrow and Saturdayâ€”upon
which too much has been written
already. But we can't overlook such
a perfect opportunity to add a few
more words.
Now that Michigan has decided
not to enter a team, which really
means thrt they decided not to
send Willis Ward, it would appear
that the Stanford "four ace" team's
chances would improve accord
ingly.
Actually, though, it cut the Card
chances just a trifle, although U.S.C.
and Cal will undoubtedly find it a
benefit. The fact remains that Ward
would have cut into the Trojan and
Bear sprint, hurdle, and broad
jump points but would have inter
fered little with Indian entrants.
Sammy Klopstock would be the
only Card to run up against Mr.
Ward and we like to think that Sam
; could have handled him in good
fashion had such a meeting taken
place at the 1.C.4-A. meet.
With their Michigan competi
tion called off, and varied reports
of weak Yale, Princeton, Pennsyl
vania. Michigan State, Dartmouth,
and Holy Cross teams the old
Trojan war horse can already he
gin to consider itself 1.C.4-A.
champion for 1935.
California, with George Anderson
: no longer bothered by lriend Ward,
is right up there with U.S.C. and
| Stanford's "four aces" will make
' their presence known on that Cam
i bridge oval.
