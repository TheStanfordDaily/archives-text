# THEN THERE ARE THE N.C.2-A.'s
## 
### 
Not until June 21 will another
Farm cinder team tread the competi
tive track. At that time Dink Tem
pleton's lads will see what kind of
showing they can make in the
N.C.2-A. meet at Berkeley.
Twenty-six men are on the Stan
ford entry list but before that event
comes off the schedule of entrants
will probably dwindle down to about
11 or 12.
The Stanford horizon over Ber
keley way should he a little
brighter than it has at Huston for
the 1.C.4-A. competition. The rea
son he explained tliusly.
In the eastern meet, open only to
universities having membership in
the 1.C.A.A.A.A., entries are rela
tively limited. There will be few

standouts to cut into the points that
U.S.C. and California anticipate.
But in the National Collegiates,
open to any college athlete, there
will be a score of entrants sent l;y
small schools throughout the coun
try to compete unattached.
They won't care about building
up a team score; they'll be inter
ested in placing high, and some of
(lie big teams will discover that
places will be ?*t a premium.
According to the dope men, Stan
ford, with her small team, should do
better in open competition, and if so,
Berkeley next month will be the
place and time.
The N.C.2-A.\s will wind up the
season for most of the Stanford
team, but a few will join Olympic
Club ranks, to travel eastward to
, Lincoln, Nebraska, for the A.A.U.
meet early in July.
Plans are still in the embryo
j state concerning the trip. Dink
I Templeton reports that there is some
I talk of journeying southward for
! the Far Western A.A.U. meet at San
Diego the week before and then
turning east for the Nebraska affair.
Thus the lid won't be clamped
down on the Stanford track season
for another month. Not a very suc
| cessful season so far but there is
! still hope.

j state concerning the trip. Dink
I Templeton reports that there is some
I talk of journeying southward for
! the Far Western A.A.U. meet at San
Diego the week before and then
turning east for the Nebraska affair.
Thus the lid won't be clamped
down on the Stanford track season
for another month. Not a very suc
