# Traditions Broken As Lawyers Elect Woman
## 
### 
Tradition was broken when the
Stanford law school Law Associa
tion elected Elizabeth "Gracie"
Crow, as secretary. Not only do
women invade the very practice it
| self and the sacred steps, but they
must needs seek office in the con
trolling body. Miss Crow is the first
woman ever to hold office in the
association.
Other officers elected for next year
were Louis Penfield as president
and Reid Whiting, treasurer. Bruce
Thompson and Bill Sullivan were
elected to the committee. The pur
pose of the organization is to unite
the extra-curricular activities of
the law students and supervise moot
court, a favorite diversion of the se
rious minded scholars of Black
sione and Coke.
