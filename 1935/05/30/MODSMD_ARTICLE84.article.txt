# DEBATERS TRAVEL 60,000 MILES, VIE IN 175 ARGUMENTS
## Joffre Medal, Western Title Among Honors Won 
### 
Sixty thousand miles—enough for
ton round-trips to New York or two
times around the world—that is the
sum total of the mileage covered by
Stanford debaters in the most out
standing year of Stanford's forensic
history, according to figures com
piled by Debate Manager Bob Gros.
Further investigation reveals that
Stanford participated in 175 debates,
20 of them radio affairs, against 75
schools, visited 35 states, entered five
tournaments, won five permanent
trophies, and was represented by 50
student debaters.
Trip Outstanding
The most (noteworthy event in the
year's activity was the transconti
nental tour undertaken by three sep
arate teams covering the four cor
ners of the country and penetiating
into Canadian territory on both the
eastern and western coasts.
The team composed of Packey
McFarland and Bob Grander took
care of the Northeastern and Atlantic
seaboard states and visited McGill
University in Montreal, while Fred
Bold and Andrew Bright made the
mid-western and southern swing of
of the tour. The western team of
Gros, Dave Meilinkoff, and Bill Rog
ers meanwhile met schools in their
Pocky Mountain, Southern Califor
nia, and Pacific Northwest coverage.
Victories Listed
Among the tournament victories,
Rogers and Meilinkoff won the West
ern championship against 100 teams
at Salt Lake City last fall; Robert
Hartmann and Joel Slein won the
California championship of junior
college and lower division teams at
San Francisco last month.
Other Stanford winners and win
nings were: Marshall Dill, Jr., and
Meilinkoff, first two places in the
classic annual Joffre debate; Gros
and Rogers, San Francisco Common
wealth Club plaque by victory over
California; and Rogers, first place in
after-dinner speaking contest of the
Pacific Forcnsic League.
Radio Tilts Numerous
Of the numerous radio debates, the
feature of the year was the Stanford-
Columbia clash over a transconti
nental hookup of the NBC. Cardinal
speakers participated in four of
KGO's Saturday afternoon inter
collegiate debates, as well as several
over KQW in San Jose. An all-
Western NBC hookup carried a Brit
ish Columbia-Stanford debate ear
lier this month.
Campus debates include the gu
bernatorial forum in October, East
ern vs. Western transcontinental
teams for the benefit of the Conva
lescent Home in April, the British
Columbia academic-robed affair this
month, and the Joffre against U.C. in
March.
Delegates Sent
Large representations from Stan
ford were sent to the annual Pi
Kappa Delta tournament at Stockton
in February, and to the Debate Con
gress at San Jose last month.
Wayne Richardson, frosh manager,
led the frosh squad in one of their
most successful years, winning the
California championship and meet
ing all of the leading schools on the
coast. The women's squad was man
aged by Benita Calmenson, and
though no championship was won,
they had many debates on semi
philosophical subjects.
Manager Quoted
Says Gros: "We feel that this has
been a banner year, and we have
been proud to carry the Stanford
name throughout the country. Splen
did reports followed the transconti
nental teams wherever they went
and we were swamped with numer
ous invitations which could not be
met.
"As far as I am concerned, our
greatest accomplishment has been
carrying on such a program that
every man out for debate was given
a chance to get practical experience.
This, after all. is the criterion of true
success, measured by the Stanford
ideal of debating,"
The Cardinals' extensive program
can be realized when compared with
U.C.'s record of only 9800 miles, 151)
debates, 15 radio debates, and 25
schools opposed.
