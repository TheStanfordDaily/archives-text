WASHINGTON, May 29 (/Pi. — j
Hasty precautionary measures in an
effort to prevent the AAA from'
meeting any such fate Ht the hands
of the courts as befell NRA were
reported under consideration today
by leaders of the farm program.
Secretary of Agriculture Wallace I
and others poked over the Supreme
Court's NRA decision to see what
effect it might have upon the AAA.
A high official, declining to be
quoted by name, said it was pos
sible that in rewriting the pending j
AAA amendments, changes in the
wording of the original Agricul- 1
tural Adjustment Act might be
made in an effort to plug possible
legal loopholes and defects.
The opinion was expressed that
several months might elapse before;
the AAA met any definite crisis, and '
officials said they hoped many con- j
troversial points might be settled by
that date.
Records at the AAA disclose a!
total of 59 open cases in various!
courts, involving validity of phases;
of the adjustment act.
Only one case, a suit contesting 1
validity of the Bankhead cotton law, |
has reached the Supreme Court. Va- !
lidity of this iaw was upheld directly
by the Fifth Court of Appeals.
Plan Revision
Amendments to the AAA, returned j
to committee by the Senate after the !
NRA decision, would tighten the ,
authority of the Agriculture Secre- i
tary over marketing agreements and
licenses.
Senator Smith (D., S.C.), chairman
of the Agricultural Committee, to]
which the amendments were recom- \
mitted, said attorneys of the Depart- j
ment of Agriculture were working j
out revisions in the bill in line with |
the Supreme Court decision.
License Change
The principal changes, he said, will :
be in the licensing sections.
While reiterating his conviction
that the court decisions did not affect i
present AAA law, Smith said he wasj
asking the department attorneys to i
submit information on whether the j
Bankhead cotton control act and the j
Smith - Carr act affecting tobacco j
needed revising.
The revised bill, he said, should be <
in the hands of the committee, "per
haps by tomorrow" in time to be
considered on the committee's gen- 1
eral calendar.

WASHINGTON, May 29 (/Pi. — j
Hasty precautionary measures in an
effort to prevent the AAA from'
meeting any such fate Ht the hands
of the courts as befell NRA were
reported under consideration today
by leaders of the farm program.
Secretary of Agriculture Wallace I
and others poked over the Supreme
Court's NRA decision to see what
effect it might have upon the AAA.
A high official, declining to be
quoted by name, said it was pos
sible that in rewriting the pending j
AAA amendments, changes in the
wording of the original Agricul- 1
tural Adjustment Act might be
made in an effort to plug possible
legal loopholes and defects.
The opinion was expressed that
several months might elapse before;

troversial points might be settled by
