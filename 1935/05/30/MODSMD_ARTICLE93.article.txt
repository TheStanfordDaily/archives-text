# TRAVELS OF A STANFORD ROUGH

### CRANT LEIBERT 
Mexico City.
It seemed almost as if I were in
Paris when I woke up this morning:
The honking of taxis, the distinctly
foreign hum and buzz of early morn
ing business, the view, from my
window, of the broad avenue, Paso
do la Reforma; and in the lobby, the
excited tourists, mingling with the
dignified citizens, as they searched
for their guides to the day's sight
seeing tour. Yes, it was Paris—until
the waitress asked me if I wanted
beans with my breakfast.
It was a suipri.se, almost a shock,
to encounter anything as modern as
La Capital after a month of wander
ing in the other Mexican cities and
country towns. The city is a.s urban
as most of (he country is primitive.
| Too horribly urban, I found before
I had walked more than ten blocks,
which brought me into the poorer
quarter. Never before have I seen
such an excrescence of filth, poverty,
malformities and resignation. In
dians, mostly, who had drifted in
from the country villages, which they
foresook for the glare of bright
lights. They were too miserable to
even beg; they, the least apathetic,
simply looked at me with dumb
regard, as if I had been an unknown
visitor from another planet. Old
women sat with their heads in their
laps, children lay stretched out on
the street, men just stood there, all
waiting, waiting for what? I could
n't help but wonder.

I stopped in at several of the sec
ond-hand bookstores, and was
struck by the inordinate amount of
French grammars, dictionaries, and
novels. The proprietor of one told
me that it had been the fashion sev
eral years back to learn French.
Everyone had started it, but given
up, I guess, when he came to the
irregular verbs.
Chapultepec Castle, located in the
huge forest which is Chapultcpec
Park, is the Mexican White House.
It was the official residence of the
emperors and presidents since Agus
tin Iturbidc was made ruler after
Mexico won her independence from
Spain until the election of the pres
ent president, Senor Cardenas, who
declared a more humble abode was
appropriate for the leader of the
National Revolutionary Party. After
taking a look around the castle, I
wouldn't be surprised if he moved
out because the place was haunted.
MAKE ROOM DEPOSITS
Men students who will room in a
dormitory during summer quarter
must pay deposits in the Dean of
Men's office in the first week of June.
Toyon will be open.

lights. They were too miserable to
even beg; they, the least apathetic,
simply looked at me with dumb
regard, as if I had been an unknown
visitor from another planet. Old
women sat with their heads in their
laps, children lay stretched out on
the street, men just stood there, all
waiting, waiting for what? I could
n't help but wonder.

I stopped in at several of the sec
ond-hand bookstores, and was
struck by the inordinate amount of
French grammars, dictionaries, and
novels. The proprietor of one told
me that it had been the fashion sev
eral years back to learn French.
Everyone had started it, but given
up, I guess, when he came to the
irregular verbs.
Chapultepec Castle, located in the
huge forest which is Chapultcpec
Park, is the Mexican White House.
It was the official residence of the
emperors and presidents since Agus
tin Iturbidc was made ruler after
Mexico won her independence from
Spain until the election of the pres
ent president, Senor Cardenas, who
declared a more humble abode was
appropriate for the leader of the
National Revolutionary Party. After
taking a look around the castle, I
wouldn't be surprised if he moved
out because the place was haunted.

Mexico City.
It seemed almost as if I were in
Paris when I woke up this morning:
The honking of taxis, the distinctly
foreign hum and buzz of early morn
ing business, the view, from my
window, of the broad avenue, Paso
do la Reforma; and in the lobby, the
excited tourists, mingling with the
dignified citizens, as they searched
for their guides to the day's sight
seeing tour. Yes, it was Paris—until
the waitress asked me if I wanted
beans with my breakfast.
It was a suipri.se, almost a shock,
to encounter anything as modern as
La Capital after a month of wander
ing in the other Mexican cities and
country towns. The city is a.s urban
as most of (he country is primitive.
| Too horribly urban, I found before
I had walked more than ten blocks,
which brought me into the poorer
quarter. Never before have I seen
such an excrescence of filth, poverty,
malformities and resignation. In
dians, mostly, who had drifted in
from the country villages, which they
foresook for the glare of bright
lights. They were too miserable to
even beg; they, the least apathetic,
simply looked at me with dumb
