AN AUTO SHOP TALK
A CHAT WITH JACK TIPTON, E.M.
"I always like to think of the fellow who couldn't stand
the sight of mud or grease or traffic stains on his car.
Truth was, he was forever having his car washed and
polished. He'd even look under the fenders to make sure
all the mud was off—said he didn't want them to get
so rusty they'd fall off the car. Yep, he's driving that car
today. If you didn't know it was a 1928 model, you'd
say it was a 1935. It looks that new."
