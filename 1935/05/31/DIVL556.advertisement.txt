You're GRADUATING with
HONORS in CLOTHES choice
About two years ago we entered Palo Alto
as a "Junior Transfer" and within that time
we have grown from a tiny, one-room shop to
our present multi-shopped CLOTHES CLOSET.
We are indeed grateful to you Senior Coeds
for your support and interest in order that all
of this might be possible . . .
And we may only hope that we shall be able
to continue serving successive Senior Classes
in the manner in which we have been able to
serve You: the SENIOR CLASS OF 1935!
