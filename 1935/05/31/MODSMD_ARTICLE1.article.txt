# Farm Talent Faces Audience Tonight In Spring Musical
## Students Write, Direct, Act In Entertainment For First Time FEW TICKETS REMAIN Songs, Skits, Dances To Be Featured in Show 
### 
The Assembly Hall curtain will
rise at 8:30 tonight on "Follies Bour
geois," the first student-written, stu
dent - directed, and student - acted
musical on the campus.
Last night's successful dress re
hearsal is past history. Each line is
letter-perfect, and each prop in its
place for tonight's performance. The
last remaining tickets will be on sale
at A.S.S.U. offices today, for 25, 50,
and 75 cents, or at the Assembly Hall
box office at 7 o'clock.
Probably the most remarkable
thing about the entire performance,
even more unusual than its songs,
dances, or sketches, is the fact that
the entire show is the work of stu
dents.
Preston Directs
Hart Preston, as general director,
has been in complete charge of plan
ning and assembling the entire musi
cal. Working under him as skit di
rector was Frank O'Neill, who has
cast and trained actors for each skit.
James Benet, assistant, also did much
of the continuity and served with
O'Neill and Preston on the advisory
board.
Fred Nagel has successfully as
sembled and trained the orchestra
which will provide melody for the
entire show — and original student
writen melody at that.

for the "Follies" and trained a cho

effects required, complete the staff of
directors.
