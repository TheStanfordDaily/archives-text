# Fate of NRA Still Undecided
## Court Verdict Causes Cut In Wages, Prices 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 30 (/P). —A
mounting tabulation of pricc cuts
and wage slashes was maintained to
day at NRA headquarters, while
President Roosevelt still felt for the
public pulse before deciding what to
do about NRA.
The chief executive went into
the muddled situation with Donald
Ricnberg, Secretary Perkins, and
members of the National Industrial-
Recovery Board in a two-hour con
ference which discussed remedies
generally but rcached no conclu
sions.
Word Expected Today '
Prevalent opinion was that some
announcement might be expected
from Mr. Roosevelt tomorrow, al
though even that still was uncertain
and was based principally on the
fact that he has a press conference
scheduled for tomorrow morning.
Leaving the President's oflice,
Richberg, in apparent good humor,
parried the questions of reporters
generally, but did disclose the com
pilation of code abandonments which
his aids at NRA were tabulating.
To Publish Record
The plan is, he said, to make this
record public, possibly tomorrow, as
a specific example of the immediate
results flowing from the Supreme
Court's decision that NRA's code
structure was unconstitutional and
therefore void.
The White House kept close check,
too, on letters received. Of some
12000, said Stephen T. Early, one of
the White House secretariat, only
three urged final abandonment of
NRA, with the remainder advocating
its continuance in such form as the
terms of the court opinion would
permit.
