# 'ACES' SET FOR TODAY'S I.C.4-A. PRELIMINARIES
## Klopstock, Mottram Face Hardest Competition; Reynolds Favored 
### Warren Breed 
I Stanford's four aces go into their
j 1.C.4-A. trials today. According to
the dope and the hope, they should
! all qualify: the big day, when the
j points count, is tomorrow.
And it's about time the big day
came. Here on the Farm there has
j been talk of this day since October.
First there wasn't going to be a Card
team back there; then we were going
to defend our title; then only three
were going back; then two big stars
got injured—who was going back?
Last Saturday night Coach Bill El
lington, Sam Klopstock, Jim Rey
nolds, Phil Levy, and Johnny Mot
tram entrained. Now we wonder

how they are going to fare against
the pick of the East, plus S.C. and
Cal.
23 Points to Cards
Since no news has as yet leaked
back about any startling new devel
opments, local dopesters are still
picking the quartet to score about 23
points—no less and certainly no
more. This total puts them far be
hind Troy and the Golden Bears, and
leaves them competing with Harvard
(strong in the hammer throw) for
third place.
Levy, who was put on the eligibil
ity block yesterday, and Reynolds,
in the discus and shot, are two of the
surest meet winners. Phil may be
inspired by the Boston background
and sail the platter out to new
lengths, maybe to 170 feet. Jim, who
should be inspired too, is due for a
great heave, but competition will
be lacking.
Klopstock to Be Busy
Sammy Klopstock will spend an
other of his now usual fausy after
noons. He's got to qualify in both
hurdles; th<; highs should be no
worry but the lows present a few
more able dime-clippers. Kloppy in
the finals will still be bothered by his
old Coast bugaboos, Moore and
Wood of the Bears, and Cope, Sla
ley, Hall, and St.rother of the Tro
jans—all gunning for little Sammy.
Mottram also has his difficulties.
There is last year's champion, Odell
of Manhattan, Johnson of Harvard,
and Fink and Fitzgerald of the Bears
also with straight and narrow spears.
Johnny will be called upon to hit
close to 220 feet, to garner his blue
ribbon. Ellington needs John's win
over Johnson to get the third place
over Harvard.
The meet will be run off in Gus
Kirby's meter system, so times will
not be familiar.

points—no less and certainly no
more. This total puts them far be
hind Troy and the Golden Bears, and
leaves them competing with Harvard
(strong in the hammer throw) for
third place.
Levy, who was put on the eligibil
ity block yesterday, and Reynolds,
in the discus and shot, are two of the
surest meet winners. Phil may be
inspired by the Boston background
and sail the platter out to new
lengths, maybe to 170 feet. Jim, who
should be inspired too, is due for a
great heave, but competition will
be lacking.
Klopstock to Be Busy
Sammy Klopstock will spend an
other of his now usual fausy after
noons. He's got to qualify in both
hurdles; th<; highs should be no
worry but the lows present a few
more able dime-clippers. Kloppy in
the finals will still be bothered by his
old Coast bugaboos, Moore and
Wood of the Bears, and Cope, Sla
ley, Hall, and St.rother of the Tro
jans—all gunning for little Sammy.
Mottram also has his difficulties.
There is last year's champion, Odell
of Manhattan, Johnson of Harvard,
and Fink and Fitzgerald of the Bears
also with straight and narrow spears.
Johnny will be called upon to hit
close to 220 feet, to garner his blue
ribbon. Ellington needs John's win
over Johnson to get the third place
over Harvard.
The meet will be run off in Gus
Kirby's meter system, so times will
not be familiar.
I Stanford's four aces go into their
j 1.C.4-A. trials today. According to
the dope and the hope, they should
! all qualify: the big day, when the
j points count, is tomorrow.
And it's about time the big day
came. Here on the Farm there has
j been talk of this day since October.
First there wasn't going to be a Card
team back there; then we were going
to defend our title; then only three
were going back; then two big stars
got injured—who was going back?
Last Saturday night Coach Bill El
lington, Sam Klopstock, Jim Rey
nolds, Phil Levy, and Johnny Mot
tram entrained. Now we wonder

how they are going to fare against
the pick of the East, plus S.C. and
Cal.
23 Points to Cards
Since no news has as yet leaked
back about any startling new devel
opments, local dopesters are still
picking the quartet to score about 23
points—no less and certainly no
more. This total puts them far be
hind Troy and the Golden Bears, and
leaves them competing with Harvard
(strong in the hammer throw) for
third place.
