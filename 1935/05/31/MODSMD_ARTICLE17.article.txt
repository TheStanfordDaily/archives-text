# Campus Will Entertain Japanese Delegation
## 
### 
Japanese delegates to the Japan-
America student conference at Port
land this summer will stop on the
campus for a few days in August.
Students interested in aiding in
entertainment arrangements here
should seo Marie MacSpadden.
Those students who aid in en
tertaining and lodging the Japanese
delegates will probably be favored
by the University in naming its del
ogates to send to Japan next year.
