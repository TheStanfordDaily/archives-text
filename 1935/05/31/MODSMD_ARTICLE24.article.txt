pointment as 1935-36 dramatic man
ager, succeeding Dick Frank. Hardy,
who has spent the last year as co

one of the closest competitions in
recent years.
"If there were any way of there
being a dual managership, both
these men would certainly have been
appointed," commented Frank.

Frank for the last three quarters,
and both have been thoroughly
trained in the routine duties of the
office. Despite all publicity to the
contrary, the organization of the
Dramatic Council has not been al
