# And So It Ends

Dim; Don:
Tonight is the- night, and another volume
must end. and I find mvsolf sitting hero in the
venerable old swivel chair, trying to think ot
something to say to you that you have not
already read perhaps ten times in some other
editor's swan song to his sueeessor.
Moralise all pretty fair things must eome to
an end, because it's not fair tor one lellow to
hog anything until he grows too sure of him
self, perhaps to the disadvantage ol the cam
pus, this sheet rips off another spring quarter
and prepares to take on a new chief next fall.
You are in a good spot, Hoh. You are tor
lunate in that you know Stanford as well as
if not better than any otliei man who has ever
laden into the editor's hoots on this crazy
campus. Ami when I say crazy, I do not mean
in Ihe sense of being unexplainable. Crazy in
rather a delightful way, in the sense of close
intimacy with fellow students, in the sense
of knowing pretty well what goes on from the
basement of Encina to,the hist tar reaches ol
the Fiji house.
It's funny how many things will reach your
ears and clamor for expression in your edi
torial column, Hob. You will hear ot outraged
dignity, of graft running rampant in the midst
of a corrupt student body, of student dissatis
faction with the president's ofliee, with the
dean's oflice, even with the citizenship library,
if there still is one next year.
And you will have to turn an obliging ear
lo these complaints, whether they sound ri
diculously fantastic, or whether they sound
like the harsh outpourings of some intro
verted soul. The point is, everyone with a
gripe turns to you to right it. You are the
editor, you are the voice of some thirty-live
hundred people and last but not least, you
are the guy to be so easily blamed, if anyone
happens to take a dislike to anything you say.
One Ihing, Hob, you will never gel an oppor
tunity to heroine conceited around Ibis news
paper. .lust when you think thai you have
turned a very neat trick, accomplished a coup
d'etat, along will come a sti.iging campus
opinion lo pin your ears back and make you
feel that it's all futile anyhow.
Hut it is not all futile. Of all university
papers, this Daily sheet has within it the ca
pacity to right more wrongs, and express more
candid opinions, than most other publications
that call themselves college newspapers. At
your immediate head stands a man who be
lieves absolutely in the freedom of the college
press. Dr. Wilbur will see straight with you
on every subject, as long as you are qualified
lo write of it accurately,' objectively, and in a"
decent manner.
As for actual advice, I have not much to
oiler you. Next year will bring with it new
problems. The long, liposome campaign to
bring an adequate theater lo Stanford has
been won. Many rabid ex-editors can now
brealhe contented sighs when they look back
at an editorial policy almost as ancient as a
law grad who decides to go into medicine.
Hul you will slill have with you those pleas
ant little morsels the I nion, the Hookstore.
rushing, and a few equally-as-juicy gripes.
Filher you will handle thcin from the very
beginning, or they will rise up and gel in your
hair and make your life a shambles.
Mcniembcr (lie policy started nol very long
ago of investigating before you attack, think
ing before you write, and being ready to re
tract if you have made a mistake that may
cause harm lo someone.
You have an excellent stall", a business man
ager who understands the fine points of the
game, and above all. you have the ability to
make Yolunie 8Â«S one that will long be remem
bered 011 the Farm. So, best of luck to you,
Hob, from someone who is finding out tonight
the full meaning of Ihe word "ex."
Sincerely,
