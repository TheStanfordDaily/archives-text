## THANK GOD FOR THE SUPREME COURT 
### CROMPTON BANGS, Jr 
BOSTON, May 28.—The "nine old men" of the Su
preme Court who may be old but are the wiser for it,
have wrung the Blue Eagla's neck. In the famous
Sehecter "sick chicken case" they unanimously found
NRA unconstitutional. It will probably go down in
history along with McCulloeh vs. Maryland and the
Died Scott case as the court's most far-teaching de
cisions. It is a great victory for our system of govern
ment and just as great a defeat for those who want to
act first and think afterward.
Naturally the New Deal lias lost its most im
portant legal battle. In the process President
Roosevelt and Donald Richberg deliberately dis
regarded the most expert legal advice of even their
own brain-trusters. Two years ago Professor
Felix Frankfurter of Harvard Law School told
them NRA was legally unconstitutional as it stood;
could become constitutional only through state
NRA's and solid success in what it tried to do.
The first requirement was impossible; the second
never happened.
It is rather funny to think that the basic New Deal
measure should have fallen because of a crate of sick
chickens slaughtered by a Brooklyn rabbi for the
Kosher trade. Why the Schecter case was picked for
the test only God and Mr. Richberg know; after yes
terday's decision, even God is in some doubt.
The Schecter Brothers were Brooklyn poultry
dealers, buying and selling only in New York City.
No interstate commerce here; the court didn't think so
either, dismissed this New Deal contention in one
sentence. At any rate, they were convictd of violating
the NRA poultry code and heavily fined. The lower
federal courts upheld the marketing provisions of the
code, but declared the wages and hours restrictions
unconstitutional. The? Supreme Court went them one
better and declared the whole thing was plainly un
constitutional—NßA. 750 codes, and all.
In arriving at its decision, the court looked at
two things: (1) Did Congress delegate too much
power to the President and the NRA? (2) What
was interstate commerce as defined in the Con
stitution and by the court?
First the court decided Congress had tried to dele
gate legislative authority to the executive branch
without setting up any standards or fixing any limits.
So the President and Code Authorities had virtually
been given the power to do what they pleased; it
really amounted to giving trade associations power
to make laws as they pleased. This, said the court,
was clearly unconstitutional, and could not be justified
by emergencies. Emergency does not justify scrap
ping the Constitution.
But if the powers had been delegated to the NRA
as they have been to the Federal Trade Commission,
the Interstate Commerce Commission, and the Federal
Radio Commission, the court implied that the NRA
would have been constitutional —at least as far as
delegation of power is concerned.
Even more far-reaching is the court's* discus
sion as to the nature of interstate commerce. In
declaring the NRA unconstitutional because it
tried to include as interstate commerce any
thing that had an indirect effect on it, the court
reviewed carefully all its previous decisions on
the subject. After considering all these cases,
Chief Justice Hughes decided that to give the
federal government control over indirect inter
state commerce would amount to giving it con
trol over ALL commerce, thus wiping out our
federal system and giving us a completely central
ized government.
These faults pointed out by the court can be cor
rected, but they must be carefully corrected. There
have been too many New Deal laws written over
night by a few tired men cooped up in a hotel room.
Some features of NRA, such as hours and wages,
might be kept, but this can be done only by the states
and the United Slates together. If there are any more
codes they can be only lor .such industries as shipping,
bus lines, etc., which are actually in interstate
commerce.
All in all, the NRA has been a valuable experiment.
It failed, but it should have taught us that we can't
do too much too soon. It is much better to go forward
one step at a time than to go forward ten and then
have to retreat twenty.
There is a way to Recovery. It is the Common
Sense way of leaving the government's duties to the
government and private initiative to the individual.
Progress has so far been made without scrapping
the Constitution and it can continue to be so made.
For pointing this out. and putting a stop to reckless
delegation and use of power, thank God for the
Supreme Court.
