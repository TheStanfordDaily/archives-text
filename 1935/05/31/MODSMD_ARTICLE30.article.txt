# OUR HASHER SEZ:

### 
One blast of the bugle—no, it's not taps, it's just
' the signal for Our Hasher to clear the tabic* Wring
j out the old, wring in the new grut from the dish
l towels. In short, 'tis time for Our Hasher to fold his
i pedals (loud and soft) for the summer. I realize that
the Deegees and the Phi Delts will miss my cheery
j'words of welcome for the next two weeks, but then I
may be back again next year, if the Phi Delts don't find
a lake to throw me in. So. it's one blast of the bugle
| buzzer, or the buzzer-bugle, and time to clear the last
load of muck from the dining room.
With the last trayful. Our Hasher brings in a list
of Stanford's All-American Hashers, those sterling
lads who have served the little ladies faithfully and
i well for the past year.
It has indeed been hard to select this list from
such a field of outstanding performers, and it is with
a tear in my eye when I realize what a fine lost of
athletes must be relegated to the second string.
