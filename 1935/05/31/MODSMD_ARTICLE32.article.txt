MELLINKOFF—MUCK
The Editor, Sir:
My regards to Mr. MellinkofT, |
campus muckraker, on his astute-,
ness in discovering the Ex Com
mittee ' $45 Diddle." It's been in the
budget, so his job wasn't hard.
Isn't it amazing that Ex Commit
tee . . . can grant salaries ranging j
up to $80 per month . . . can give
rings, sweaters, caps and cups with- j
out a peep from the Bull Editor; but
when it budgets $2 apiece for an j
evening's enjoyment the Guardian
of the Campus Morals screams his
head off? All other paid positions
. . . are of some honor but it has been
deemed expedient to give them some j
award and ... Ex Committee is
worth three cents per hour.
Mellinkoff has taken cracks at the
efficiency of Ex Committee. ... It
considers only problems that are I
controversial and which subsidiary
committees have failed to solve. It
meets trouble. Ex Committee makes [
mistakes but ... is worth the three '
cents an hour Mr. Mellinkoff is be- 1
ing diddled for.
