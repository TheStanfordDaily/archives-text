# CONSTITUTIONALISM
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
To those who thank the Supreme
Court for restoring America to con
stitutionalism: "What is the good of
its restoration?" Obviously, there is
none ... It may conduce to the
welfare of Society. When constitu
tionalism ceases this end, it loses its
merit. This fact caused the drafters
of the constitution to insert the right
of amendment . . .
I admit that the decision was justi
fied because the NRA was uncon
stitutional ... To insist that a con
stitution should not change ... is
. . . to destroy its purposes . . . The
government must intervene in the
problems of business and labor. So
ciai welfare depends on their har
mony . . . and it is time that gov
ernment tries to effect harmony. In
telligent people cannot be bowled
over by shouting names . . .
People are not going to be con
tented with the scrapping of the
NRA because the evil which it sought
to remedy still remains . . . The NRA
was a noble attempt to obviate these
economic defects; if it has failed
then a substitute must be found . . .
Thanking God for the Supreme
Court is not the solution . . .
â€”Joe Gill
