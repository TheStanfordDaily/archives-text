# BULL SESSION
## A 						FAREWELL TO THE EDITORIAL "WE" 
### 
For two years I have written this
column, under a series of editors
with progressively weaker editorial
policies. For two years I have en
joyed a greater freedom from cen
sorship than will probably ever be
i mine again. This morning the last
vestiges of censorship have been
removed.
For-months I have had to explain
my position to the editor, before 1
I could explain it to the campus. I
have had to convince editors that
the thing "could run," and that the
[.censorship from above and below,
which they feared, existed chiefly
! in their own minds and not in rcal
| ity. Several of the editors have tied
: their own hands with their petty
! fears, and I have had to fight to keep
them from tying mine. But as a
i result—l have never said anything 1
did not believe, have always said
what 1 did believe, and most always
; all of it.
And—when Bull Session passed
the editor, passed through the
Scylla and Charybdis of copy reader
and linotyper—l have watched in
tently the popular reaction. I have
always believed (and still do) that
il too many people agreed with me,
j I must be wrong. I have found that
it i.s most difficult to stir people with
broad concepts, that they react much
more promptly and vigorously to
small things—like the $45 diddle,
1 and the "fire" in Encina. And I have
| found that though people agree with
S you 100 per cent, that does not by
any means indicate 'that they will
j do anything about it—even though

in a position to do so.
One of the most common reactions
tc Bull Session has been, "Yah, yah,
you're always kicking." That com
plaint has never bothered me much,
because I realized that the complaint
was by and large a truthful one. But
1 have always believed that in any
institution there is a definite need
for the critic. I have worked under
the assumption that all truthful crit
icism is constructive. For every such
t riticism involves a substitute pro
posal — if nothing else, at least
abandonment of a definite evil. That
is the principle under which NEA
was attacked, and finally brought to
bay.
At some time or other, I have
sponsored almost every lost cause on
the campus: abolition of the Bawl-
Out, the grade system, student gov
ernment, social regulations, the
"Honor" Code, and rah-rahism; in
troduction of beer in the Union, and
of lower prices in the Bookstore and

tlie Union. The latter is the lostest
among lost causes, simply because
the powers are not interested in
lowering prices. The Administration
is satisfied to keep the Union on a
competitive level with the highest
priced cafes in Paly; the students
are a good source of revenue. I have
"advocated" or "urged" or "sup
ported" or "opposed" too many things
to list. J have made
friends and enemies on almost every
issue I have ever tackled; and 1 like
the friends and am satisfied with the
enemies.
There is one Issue I have not taken
up; and to clear my conscience that
must be done now. The salary of
the* editor of The Stanford Daily
should be abolished, and other stu
dent salaries correspondingly re
duced. The editorship of The Daily
carries with it so much potential
power and amusement that any
campus journalist would be happy
to take the position on a non-profit
basis (just ask them). That being
the case, Daily salaries are unwar
ranted drains on the A.S.S.U. treas
ury. In the case of the campus dog
jobs— the managerships — there is
justification for some salary, but not
the prodigious incomes that now ex
ist in some spots. If next year's Ex
Committee is of higher calibre than
this year's, the question of student
salaries would be a fertile field for
investigation and action.
And that is all. Good-bye dear
Bull Session. Though at some fu
ture date you may fall into more
capable hands than these, none will
ever be more sincere and loving.

institution there is a definite need
for the critic. I have worked under

At some time or other, I have
sponsored almost every lost cause on
the campus: abolition of the Bawl-
Out, the grade system, student gov
ernment, social regulations, the
"Honor" Code, and rah-rahism; in
troduction of beer in the Union, and
of lower prices in the Bookstore and

tlie Union. The latter is the lostest
among lost causes, simply because
the powers are not interested in
lowering prices. The Administration
is satisfied to keep the Union on a
competitive level with the highest
priced cafes in Paly; the students
are a good source of revenue. I have
"advocated" or "urged" or "sup
ported" or "opposed" too many things
to list. J have made
friends and enemies on almost every
issue I have ever tackled; and 1 like
the friends and am satisfied with the
enemies.
There is one Issue I have not taken
up; and to clear my conscience that
must be done now. The salary of
the* editor of The Stanford Daily
should be abolished, and other stu
dent salaries correspondingly re
duced. The editorship of The Daily
carries with it so much potential
power and amusement that any
campus journalist would be happy
to take the position on a non-profit
basis (just ask them). That being
the case, Daily salaries are unwar
ranted drains on the A.S.S.U. treas
ury. In the case of the campus dog
jobs— the managerships — there is
justification for some salary, but not
the prodigious incomes that now ex
ist in some spots. If next year's Ex
Committee is of higher calibre than
this year's, the question of student
salaries would be a fertile field for
investigation and action.
And that is all. Good-bye dear
Bull Session. Though at some fu
ture date you may fall into more
capable hands than these, none will
ever be more sincere and loving.

For two years I have written this
column, under a series of editors
with progressively weaker editorial
policies. For two years I have en
joyed a greater freedom from cen
sorship than will probably ever be
i mine again. This morning the last
vestiges of censorship have been
removed.
For-months I have had to explain
my position to the editor, before 1
I could explain it to the campus. I
have had to convince editors that
the thing "could run," and that the
[.censorship from above and below,
which they feared, existed chiefly
! in their own minds and not in rcal

: their own hands with their petty
! fears, and I have had to fight to keep
them from tying mine. But as a
i result—l have never said anything 1
did not believe, have always said
what 1 did believe, and most always
; all of it.
And—when Bull Session passed
the editor, passed through the
Scylla and Charybdis of copy reader
and linotyper—l have watched in
tently the popular reaction. I have
always believed (and still do) that

"Honor" Code, and rah-rahism; in
troduction of beer in the Union, and
of lower prices in the Bookstore and

tlie Union. The latter is the lostest
among lost causes, simply because
the powers are not interested in
lowering prices. The Administration
is satisfied to keep the Union on a
competitive level with the highest
priced cafes in Paly; the students
are a good source of revenue. I have
"advocated" or "urged" or "sup
ported" or "opposed" too many things
to list. J have made
friends and enemies on almost every
issue I have ever tackled; and 1 like
the friends and am satisfied with the
enemies.
There is one Issue I have not taken
up; and to clear my conscience that
must be done now. The salary of
the* editor of The Stanford Daily
should be abolished, and other stu
dent salaries correspondingly re
duced. The editorship of The Daily
carries with it so much potential
power and amusement that any
campus journalist would be happy
to take the position on a non-profit
basis (just ask them). That being
the case, Daily salaries are unwar
ranted drains on the A.S.S.U. treas
ury. In the case of the campus dog
jobs— the managerships — there is
justification for some salary, but not
the prodigious incomes that now ex
ist in some spots. If next year's Ex
Committee is of higher calibre than
this year's, the question of student
salaries would be a fertile field for
investigation and action.
And that is all. Good-bye dear
Bull Session. Though at some fu
ture date you may fall into more
capable hands than these, none will
ever be more sincere and loving.
