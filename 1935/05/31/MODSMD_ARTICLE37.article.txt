# WINNING POLOISTS WILL BE AWARDED CUBBISON TROPHY
## 
### 
Polo will make its final bid this
afternoon with the playing of the
final game in the Colonel Cubbison
Trophy series. The contest will start
at 3 o'clock on the Highway Field.
Teams will be led by Bill Rogers,
varsity captain and stellar No. 2, and
Carl Beal, hard-hitting No. 1 of the
varsity. Supporting Rogers will be
John Coffin, Charles Christin, and
Bob Niccolls, while Don McAusland,
Ed McKeon, and Bob Baird or John
Steelquist will make up the other
team.
Winner (Jets Trophy
The winner of today's contest will
receive the Colonel Cubbison Tro
phy, a perpetual plaque on which
will be inscribed the names of each
0 year's winners. In addition to this
the victors will receive silver cups
as individual trophies.
Colonel Cubbison will present cups
and plaque immediately after the
game. This is the first year that such
iin award has been made. The tro
phies are given by the Military De
partment.
Play Fast Polo
While only one man on each team
has been what could be called a
regular, the other men have played
in second string contests and on
occasions have broken into varsity
games.
It so happens that Rogers and Beal
both play forward positions on the
varsity and are dangerous scoring
threats, the former by the use of
clever mallet work and the latter
through hitting power. The other
men on the teams are good at feeding
and are good defensively as well.
Lieut. Haydon Grubbs believes
that the two teams will play as good
polo as has been seen here this sea
son barring only the Arizona series.
