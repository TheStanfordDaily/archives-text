SPEAKING OF THIS
GRID AFFAIR SATURDAY

We're going to have a chance to
see Stanford's 1935 gridders in action
Saturday, in action for the last time
until fall, and it'll be an interesting
affair as far as getting a line on the
men themselves is concerned.
But when it comes to actually siz
ing up the team as it will look next
autumn, Saturday's game will prob
ably help little. At least that's the
way Tiny Thornhill figures.
Tiny said last night if he were
to send a backiield on the grid to
day it would be the same combina
tion he announced for the coming
game—Alustiz.a, Williams, Hamil
ton and Grayson. And the rest of
team No. 1, with perhaps the ex
ception of the ends, would also be
on his Squad A.
But he is far from sure that tKey
will line up that way next Septem
ber. First of all he's worried just a
little about the toll that grades may
take. There was a day not many
years ago when seven men, all val
uable to the football machine, felt
the gentle call of the flunk-out and
although Tiny doesn't expect any
thing like that to happen this year,
he still takes that angle into con
sideration.
Thep there is always the change
that summer vacation will make in
condition. Some of Thornhill's
charges will gain weight, others will
lose, and when they begin workouts
again on September 15 there will
probably be many a noticeable
changeV
And Mill another point comes
forth whetv it is realized that dur
ing this soon-to-bc-concludcd
spring practice a lot of men have
been doing some plain and fancy
loafing. When they turn out for
fall practice it may he with a dif
ferent attitude, especially when
they realize that game season will
soon be on.
Yes, "there's no doubting that to
morrow's little battle will tell u.s
little about the team that will take
the field against San Jose State Col
lege on September 28 but we'll at
least know how things stand now.

PRETTY WEAK
THIS 1935 SCHEDULE

Not long ago we caught a glimpse
of the football schedule for next year
and it struck us as being pretty weak
for a team such as Stanford ought to
have coming up.
It went like this:
Sept. 28—San Jose State at Stanford.
Oct. s—University of S.F. at Kezar.
Oct. 12—U.C.L.A. at Stanford.
Oct. 19 —Bye.
Oct. 26—Washington at Seattle.
Oct. 26—Santa Clara at Stanford.
Nov. 9—U.S.C. at Los Angeles.
Nov. 16—Montana at Stanford.
Nov. 25—California at Stanford.
Not an intersectional contest on
the list! A little investigating
brought out fairly satisfactory rea
sons but still the schedule looks
mighty poor—and comparison with
U.S.C.'s makes it appear even
poorer.
We are told that it has been found
unsatisfactory to take the team east
between the bigger games, that
they're too worn out after the trav
eling to play well after they return
home.
We are told that eastern teams
don't like to come west during mid
season for similar reasons, that they
dislike equally traveling to the Coast
later in the year because of exams,
etc., etc.
There are a whole flock of reasons
for the rotten schedule, probably a
lot of Ihem are valid, but there are
also a lot of reasons why Stanford
ought to have a good one, an extra
good one, this year.

"SO ENDS"
FOR SPRING

With this column the Sideliner
winds up for spring of this year and
when he unwinds again it will be
right in the midst of a promising
football season.
There will be lines and lines of
football talk, and if everything goes
rightly we can predict that the
words "Stanford victory" will ap
pear mighty often. We can't help
but hope that "Stanford Rose Bowl
victory" might be written a few
times, 100.
