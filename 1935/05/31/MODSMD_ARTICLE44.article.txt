# NEW RECORD SET WHILE 63,943 SEE GIANTS WIN TWO
## 
### 
NEW YORK, May 30 (/P).—Fred
Fitzsimmons shut out the Dodgers
with two hits today to give the
Giants a 6 to 0 victory in the sec
ond game and a clean sweep of a
double header played before 63,943
paying fans, a new National League
record. The Giants won the opened
8 to 3.
Prior to today the record National
League crowd was at the Polo
Grounds on September 12 last when
the sensational Dean Brothers pitch
ed the Cardinals to victory in a
double bill over the Terrymen.
Sink to Fourth
The Giants further humiliated the
Dodgers today by scuttling them into
fourth place in the league standings.
Tlie New Yorkers shelled Van
Mungo, pride and joy of the Dodg
er hurling corps, to walk away with
the matinee, while a sparkling two
hit pitching performance by Fred
Fitzsimmons, until this year a
Dodger nemesis, was the main factor
in the second victory.
Munjjo Out
It was a heart-breaking afternoon
for the Dodgers from the start. The
Giants' siege guns began work
ing and Mungo was driven to the
showers with four hits and six runs
before two men had been retired in
the first.
Mel Ott, the youngest 10-year man
in the majors, smacked out his ninth
home run with the bases loaded and
as if that was not enough to take
the starch out of the Brooklyn
rooters, young A1 Cuceinello, mak
ing his first Polo Grounds appear
ance at second base for the Giants,
socked the first ball Mungo served
him into the stands for another
round tripper. One Giant was on
the paths.
Clark Stops Kill
Watson Clark was rushed in from
the bull pen in time to stop the
slaughter but the Giants later added
two more, one on a triple by Ott and
a single by Flank Leiber and the
other on a two-base error by Jimmy
Bucher, rookie third sacker and a
single by Joe Moore.
Roy Parmelee hurled steadily for
the Giants and but for three costly
errors would have had a shut-out.
