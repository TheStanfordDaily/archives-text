# Cards To Participate In Berkeley N.C.2-A. Meet
## 
### 
Twenty-six Stanford entry blanks
have been filed for entrance to
N.C.2-A. competition at Berkeley
June 21 and 22. The list will prob
ably dwindle to half before meet
day comes as many of the entrants
plan to drop track and return to
their homes for the summer.
Dink Templeton expects the squad
to be made up primarily of the
1.C.4-A. "four aces" bolstered by
a half dozen other good performers.
Ray Dean, Humbert Smith, A1 Her
shey, Dud Sales, Chuck Nimmo, and
Warren Dixon are most likely to be
included.

Delta Chi announces the pledging
of Bruce Young, '38.

Phi Sigma Kappa announces the
pledging of Richard J. Winzler, '37.
