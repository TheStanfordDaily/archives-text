# News of Son Expected In Kidnap Plot
## Ransom Rumored as Paid By Weyerhaeusers 
### 
TACOMA, May 30 (#>)—On the
faith of kidnapers who stole their
little son for $200,000 ransom, Mr.
and Mrs. J. P. Weyerhaeuser, Jr.,
based hopes of his return today,
amid authentie reports they have
compiled with every demand of the
snatchers.
Sources close to the family said
the money—a 50-pound stack of
Federal Reserve hills—lay in a
secret place awaiting word from
the kidnapers, who have not as
yet established contact.
Despite rumors the abductors had
been reached, and even that the
money had been paid, one family
source said "we haven't heard a
thing" from the curly-haired, 9-
year-old boy.
"We had hoped to hear something
last night or today. We are abso
lutely in the dark about him," they
said.
Official silence clothed activi
ties of the law forces as rumors
that the Alvin Karpis gang was
involved in the kidnaping brought
statements from three Tacomans
that a man resembling Volney
Davis, pal of the gang leader, had
been seen here as late as last Sat
urday.
Davis, fugitive murderer from
Oklahoma City, where he was sen
tenced to life imprisonment, is also
under indictment as one of the ac
tual kidnapers of Edward G. Bre
mer, St. Louis banker.
Seized in Kansas City last Feb
ruary, Davis was being brought to
Chicago by plane in custody of two
Department of Justice agents when
he spectacularly escaped.
