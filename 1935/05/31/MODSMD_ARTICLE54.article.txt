# First Year Of Revised A.S.S.U. Code Reviewed
## Changes Noted in By-Laws of Constitution 
### Frank Fullenwider 
This year the Associated Students
operated under a new constitution
and for the most part new by-laws.
The new system was found confus
ing since the revised handbook, due
to inconsistent copy and proof-read
ing errors, was inaccurate. During
the year these have been corrected
and now the official copy is on hand.
The constitution itself has under
gone only two slight changes. One
gives the A.S.S.U. president the
power to make appointments pro
tein until a special election can be
called and the other removes the
woman sponsor provisions from the
constitution to the by-laws, where
they belong.
By-Laws Much Changed
The changes in the by-laws have
been much wider. Articles I and II
on student control and social regu
lations are not very susceptible to
change. Except for some changes in
wording, the only one worth noting
is the provision giving the dance
chairman as well as the student po
lice the authority to report cases of
unbecoming conduct to the Councils.
As yet it hasn't been used.
Article 111 on finances contains the
controversial Daily 15 cents and now
provides that of the 75 cents each
student pays to the Daily 15 cents
shall go for editorial improvements,
the unused balance to revert to the
A.S.S.U. Article IV on elections was
left out of the handbook entirely.
Nominating assembly was changed
so that all Ex Committee and B.A.C.
members must be introduced, with
the president having discretion as to
who shall speak.
Athletic award changes made the
California Intercollegiates a letter
meet, as it was formerly; limited
tennis letters to nine men and pro
vided that men must play in two
thirds of the matches and, except
for the first four men, must win one
half of them; put baseball back on
an inning rather than a fraction-of- j
total-time basis; and made cross
country a minor sport with any man j
placing in the first 10 against Cal
being eligible.
Further Changes
The most important change has
been in the publications charter in
the method of electing a Daily editor.
Other changes give the Daily man
aging and women's editors and the
Quad managing editor salaries.
Dramatic Council changes give the
manager $50 per play instead of $35
per month and admit Ram's Head
to the Dramatic Council. In addi
tion, the Ex Committee has recom
mended that an entire new set-up be
put in when the new Theater is l
built.
Another by-law change is the for
mation of a new subsidiary com
mittee, the Music Council, consisting
of the band, symphony, choir, men's
glee club, and concert series repre
sentatives. Activities Council was
another new organization formed last
year and the only changes this year
are in the awards.

By-Laws Much Changed
The changes in the by-laws have
been much wider. Articles I and II
on student control and social regu
lations are not very susceptible to
change. Except for some changes in
wording, the only one worth noting
is the provision giving the dance
chairman as well as the student po
lice the authority to report cases of
unbecoming conduct to the Councils.
As yet it hasn't been used.
Article 111 on finances contains the
controversial Daily 15 cents and now
provides that of the 75 cents each
student pays to the Daily 15 cents
shall go for editorial improvements,
the unused balance to revert to the
A.S.S.U. Article IV on elections was
left out of the handbook entirely.
Nominating assembly was changed
so that all Ex Committee and B.A.C.
members must be introduced, with
the president having discretion as to
who shall speak.
Athletic award changes made the
California Intercollegiates a letter
meet, as it was formerly; limited
tennis letters to nine men and pro
vided that men must play in two
thirds of the matches and, except
for the first four men, must win one
half of them; put baseball back on
an inning rather than a fraction-of- j
total-time basis; and made cross
country a minor sport with any man j
placing in the first 10 against Cal
being eligible.
Further Changes
The most important change has
been in the publications charter in
the method of electing a Daily editor.
Other changes give the Daily man
aging and women's editors and the
Quad managing editor salaries.
Dramatic Council changes give the
manager $50 per play instead of $35
per month and admit Ram's Head
to the Dramatic Council. In addi
tion, the Ex Committee has recom
mended that an entire new set-up be
put in when the new Theater is l
built.
Another by-law change is the for
mation of a new subsidiary com
mittee, the Music Council, consisting
of the band, symphony, choir, men's
glee club, and concert series repre
sentatives. Activities Council was
another new organization formed last
year and the only changes this year
are in the awards.
This year the Associated Students
operated under a new constitution
and for the most part new by-laws.
The new system was found confus
ing since the revised handbook, due
to inconsistent copy and proof-read
ing errors, was inaccurate. During
the year these have been corrected
and now the official copy is on hand.
The constitution itself has under
gone only two slight changes. One
gives the A.S.S.U. president the
power to make appointments pro
tein until a special election can be
called and the other removes the
woman sponsor provisions from the
constitution to the by-laws, where
they belong.
