# Forty-Four Elected To Phi Beta Kappa
## Highest Ranking Engineers, Classes of '24 to 28, Admitted to Group 
### 
Ranking graduates in engineering
from the classes of 1924 to 1928, in
clusive, previously ineligible for
membership, were admitted to Phi
Beta Kappa in a recent move. The
Stanford chapter has, since 1929 only,
been electing qualified students from
all divisions of the University, in
cluding the School of Engineering.
The graduated engineers were list
ed as having scholarship of a quality
at least comparable with that of
members elected from other depart
ments for those same years. Those
elected, by classes, were:
Class of 1924—Cecil H. Balmat,
Harry A. Greene, Jr., Clarence T.
Hesselmeycr, Charles V. Litton,
Adam Pen-Tung Sah.
Class of 1925—Frederick E. Cle
ver, Elmer H. Hammond, Theodore
R. Hascltine, Marcel A. Lissman,
Harold L. Rordcn.
Class of 192(5—Warren S. McKay,
John A. Mancini, Allan J. Meadow
croft, Fred R. Muhs, Jr., Hugh H.
Skilling.
Class of 1927— T. Harold Acres,
Ernest E. Garnett, Jr., Harley A.
lams, Theodore L. Lenzen, J. Bur
ton McKim.
Class of 1928— J. Shirley Armficld,
William G. Hoover; Nathaniel R.
Morgan (deceased), Russell G. Rob
inson, Ira E. Wood.
These classes represent the year
they received their A.B. degree. In
1920 the lower division was estab
lished. with broad requirements. The
first class to graduate under the
lower division requirements was the
class of 1921, and it was felt that the
required work was broad enough in
scope so that engineering students iti
the lower division after 1920 had to
take much similar work to other
majors, and that they should there
fore be eligible for Phi Beta Kappa
honors.
Nathaniel A. Morgan, deceased,
was killed while on line of duty for
an electrical company, and his elec
tion is a posthumous recognition of
his high scholastic standing.
