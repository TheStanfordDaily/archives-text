Spring Practice Ends
Tomorrow's scrimmage will wind
up six weeks of spring practice,
most of which has been devoted to
trying out these new combinations
and plays, together with fundamen
tals and developing of new varsity
candidates.
Showings of several contestants
| in the stadium festivities will fur
| nish an insight into the line-up
I that will start Stanford's third-
Rosc-Bowl-gamc campaign on
September 15. Although most of
the varsity positions arc prac
] lie-ally pre-dctcrmincd, many new
; stars are apt to appear to bolster
the reserve ranks.
Stanford's coaching start' will eag-
I erly watch the work of several fresh
j men—Bill Paulman, Jimmy Coffis,
Tom Collins, Glenn Hamilton, Grant
i Stone, Johnny Wycth, Jay Hold
j ridge, Cy Oberg, and others—who
' have spent the past few weeks
1 breaking into the ways of the var
; sity. All of these men will be used
j for reserve work next fall.

I decision on the two line-ups until
j game time.
