# ELIZABETHAN EXHIBIT ON LIBRARY DISPLAY
## 
### 
A display depicting the lift', custom,
and general aspects of the Elizabethan
Period is now on exhibition at the
Stanford Library. The exhibit is be
ing shown with the idea of giving a
background to the summer quarter
course in Shakespearian production
and the Tudor lectures, under the
auspices of Dr. Margery Bailey and
the English Club.
The display, which is made up of
old books, includes the early biogra
phies and notes on Shakespeare. In
one show case, London in the day of
Shakespeare is depicted with old maps,
pamphlets, and pictures, showing the
activities and excitements of the lower
class street life. Another gives the
directly opposite picture of the Tudor
gentleman and the court life, together
with some valuable early printings on
the diplomatic relations. Tudor knowl
edge is also displayed, giving the prev
alence of certain superstitions and in
cluding views of schools and early
school books.
Besides these, other displays include
the arts and adventures of the period,
the famous books of Shakespeare's
time, with probable sources of his
works, his contemporaries and critics,
and old editions of his plays.
The well-known "Droeshout Por
trait" by Dorothy Goldner, wife of
Orville Goldner, the technical director
of the course in Shakespearian pro
duction at Stanford, is shown.
All the notes given on the various
editions were prepared by Henry David
Gray, professor of English at Stanford.
The exhibit, which will last during
the summer months, will be changed in
August to show ihe theatrical and
dramatic aspects of the Elizabethan
period.
Students from forty-three states,
three United States territories, and
fourteen foreign countries were regis
tered at Stanford during the first three
quarters of this year.
