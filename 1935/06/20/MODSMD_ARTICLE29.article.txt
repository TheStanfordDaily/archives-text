# STANFORD TRACK TEAM HAS CHANCE FOR VICTORIES AT BERKELEY MEET
## 
### MILLARD BROWNE 
It will take a lot of Jimmy Willsons
and "kids that weren't even invited"
for Stanford's track team to make its
last stand of the 1935 season even par
tially successful.
It was this "kid that wasn't invited"
last June that placed Stanford in the
position of defending champion of the
National Collegiate Athletic Associa
tion, that title to be fought for again
Friday and Saturday at Edwards Field
in Berkeley.
There is much more and greater com
petition at the Berkeley meet than at
the I.C. 4-A., at which the Indians
scored but 11 points for a tie for fifth,
but all of the added difficulties may
even prove aids to the Indians in their
final bid of a less-than-mediocre sea
son of competition.
U. S. C. Favored
Southern California, I. C. 4-A. cham
pion, will be heavily favored for the
team title this week end, with Cali
fornia, the host school, again figured
for a second place. But Stanford may
be in a position to grab third, and could
even go. after one of the upper two
positions.
There are a lot of potential points on
the Indian squad that have not been
thrown together in any meet yet, and
there is still the possibility that Stan
ford's team will get together, as it has
not done at any time this year.
Klopstock May Win
Some of the probabilities:
1. A first place in one hurdle and a
good place in the other for Sammy
Klopstock, defending low hurdle cham
pion.
2. Victoi'ies or second places in the
throe throwing divisions—Johnny
Mottram in the javelin, Phil Levy in
the discus, and Jim Reynolds in the
shot.
This, under the scoring system of 10
points for first place, could produce
nearly 50 points, which would not win,
but would be well in the money.
But there are many other possibili
ties:
1. That Captain A1 Blackman has at
last conquered a complex, and would
run a quarter mile equalling his capa
bilities, which could even win, and
would at least be good for a place.
2. Dud Sales in the javelin or A1
Hershey in the shot and discus placing
with some of those very helpful thirds
or fourths.
3. Humbert Smith, back in early sea

son 6:5 form, maybe even winning the
high jump.
All Are Possible
These are all quite possible, and if
they all materialized, the fails would
have to think again about the advisa
bility of favoring the unconquerable
Trojans.
Southern California, fully repre
sented with come through performers
at Boston, will face a real problem in
salvaging a repetition of the places
gathered in the 1.C.4-A., and she prob
ably will be unsuccessful in this. Her
strong points—broad jump and pole
vault, will .suffer at the hands of Jesse
Owens, Ohio State's great all-around
tithlete, and a bevy of good vaulters
headed by Keith Brown of Yale, new
world's record holder. Her sprinters
and 440 men are apt to be far down the
line when they tangle with fields just
a bit better.
Would Be Poor Bet
In short, the entire well-rounded
U.S.C. team may just be almost good
enough. For example, it would be a
poor bet that Phil Cope would repeat
his 1.C.4-A. high hurdle victory at
Berkeley.
California, with George Anderson as
her principal point-scorer, will suffer
a like fate; even Anderson will be lucky
to win either sprint, and may not score
better than second or third in either.
So the two who are doped for leaders
will run into much more trouble in the
individual combats than Stanford, all
of which might open things up for one
Indian come-through meet.
Stanford has officially entered 12
athletes in the meet. In addition to
those already mentioned, participants
will include Warren Dixon and "Chuck"
Nimmo, mile; George Tharp, broad
jump, and Hunt Kingsbury, hurdles.
Stanford originally entered 26 ath
letes for the championships and any of
: the 14 athletes who were not selected
this week can compete if they so desire.
