# 12,000 GUESTS SEE FIRST GRADUATION HELD IN STADIUM
## Wilbur and Hoover Deliver Addresses as 976 Get Degrees 
### 
Nine hundred seventy-six graduating
students helped make Stanford history
when they received their degrees last
Sunday. For the first time, graduation
ceremonies were held not in the Me
morial Church but in the Stadium.
Twelve thousand visitors made a
patch of color in the west end of the
Stadium, contrasting sharply with the
vast stretches of drab brown that were
the rest of the empty bowl.
Speakers who addressed the audience
through a public address system were
President Ray Lyman Wilbur and
former President Herbert Iloover.
Social Security Urged
Mr. Hoover outlined nine points
which he said contained the essentials
of social security. These were:
1. Freedom of thought, speech, wor
ship, and the right of men "to develop
their own talents and to be rewarded
for their efforts."
2. The capacity to produce a plenty.
This, he said, could only be secured
through freedom from governmental
interference.
3. Constitutional government as a
safeguard for freedom.
4. Insurance against "the concentra
tion of economic . . . and political
power."
5. "Remedy or mitigation of inter
ruptions and dislocations in the eco
nomic system." War and the business
cycle were referred to as "interruptions
and dislocations."
6. Old age and unemployment insur
ance. "The woi'ld has not yet developed
a satisfactory system.
7. Better distribution through "lower
costs, lower prices and thus higher real
wages and incomes." Elimination of
child labor, sweated labor, marginal
farms, slums, industrial conflicts, etc.
8. Widespread property ownership to
provide "a sense of freedom ... a sense
of independence."
9. Protection of the family and of
the home.
Service to Neighbor
Said Dr. Wilbur: "A prepared mind is
like a good tool. It can be used for di
verse tasks; but it needs constant
sharpening to keep ready for the next
job that comes. . . . Your own person
ality is your own greatest possession.
"Get into the game of life and play it
hard—but play it with others, respecting
their rights and their personalities.
"Stanford has tried to make you re
spect facts, to permeate you with a sense
of loyalty and honesty, to fire you with
a desire to be of service to neighbor and
nation. With confidence in you and in
our stale and nation, we set you free
with our distinguishing marks of parch
ment and hood, in the high hope that
you are prepared and will remain un
afraid."

"Stanford has tried to make you re
spect facts, to permeate you with a sense
of loyalty and honesty, to fire you with
a desire to be of service to neighbor and
nation. With confidence in you and in
our stale and nation, we set you free
with our distinguishing marks of parch
ment and hood, in the high hope that
you are prepared and will remain un
afraid."
Nine hundred seventy-six graduating
students helped make Stanford history
when they received their degrees last
Sunday. For the first time, graduation
ceremonies were held not in the Me
morial Church but in the Stadium.
Twelve thousand visitors made a
patch of color in the west end of the
Stadium, contrasting sharply with the
vast stretches of drab brown that were
the rest of the empty bowl.
Speakers who addressed the audience
through a public address system were
President Ray Lyman Wilbur and
former President Herbert Iloover.
Social Security Urged
Mr. Hoover outlined nine points
which he said contained the essentials
of social security. These were:
1. Freedom of thought, speech, wor
ship, and the right of men "to develop
their own talents and to be rewarded
for their efforts."
2. The capacity to produce a plenty.
This, he said, could only be secured
through freedom from governmental
interference.
3. Constitutional government as a
safeguard for freedom.
4. Insurance against "the concentra
tion of economic . . . and political
power."
5. "Remedy or mitigation of inter
ruptions and dislocations in the eco
nomic system." War and the business
cycle were referred to as "interruptions
and dislocations."
6. Old age and unemployment insur
ance. "The woi'ld has not yet developed
a satisfactory system.
7. Better distribution through "lower
costs, lower prices and thus higher real
wages and incomes." Elimination of
child labor, sweated labor, marginal
farms, slums, industrial conflicts, etc.
8. Widespread property ownership to
provide "a sense of freedom ... a sense
of independence."
9. Protection of the family and of
the home.
Service to Neighbor
Said Dr. Wilbur: "A prepared mind is
like a good tool. It can be used for di
verse tasks; but it needs constant
sharpening to keep ready for the next
job that comes. . . . Your own person
ality is your own greatest possession.
"Get into the game of life and play it
hard—but play it with others, respecting
their rights and their personalities.
