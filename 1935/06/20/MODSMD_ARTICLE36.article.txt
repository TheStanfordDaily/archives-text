# Bulletin Guides Choice of Vocational Study
## 
### 
A bulletin prepared to help students
in making an intelligent choice of a
major field of study at Stanford and of
a vocational goal harmonious with such
training has been published recently by
the University.
The bulletin contains summaries of a
series of lectures given to students in
1934 and 1935 by School and Depart
ment representatives who sought to
outline current trends in the various
fields of study, the scholastic training
programs in effect at Stanford Univer
sity, and the vocational outlets for
graduates from these divisions of the
University.
Much of the treatment is general
enough to be of value to students in
other universities or to those planning
for a college or university career. The
bulletin was edited by C. Gilbert
Wrenn, Assistant Registrar for Student
Personnel and Executive Secretary of
the Committee on Vocational Guidance.
Price of the bulletin is 15 cents.
