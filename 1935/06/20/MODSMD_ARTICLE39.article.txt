# FOREIGN SERVICE PRAISED IN RADIO TALK BY STUART

### 
Speaking on "The American Foreign
Sex-vice at Work," Professor Graham
Stuart of the political science depart
ment sketched the invaluable work
done by our diplomatic and consular
services in his talk during the regular
Stanford program over KGO Monday
evening.
Pointing out that the foreign services
serve as a sort of "news bureau" for
the government, Professor Stuart con
tradicted an often-current belief that
we could conduct all our foreign affairs
from Washington by cable and radio.
It is through our diplomats abroad that
we get a clear view of the foreign scene,
he said.
The services which consulates and
embassies render the traveler were also
shown by Professor Stuart. The consul,
he said, stands ready to help in case of
passport difficulties, arrests, or other
trouble which might involve the trav
eler. The embassies also perform many
minor services for the traveler's con
venience. "No task is too difficult," said
Professor Stuart, "nor is any request
too trivial."
The part our foreign services play in
immigration control was also summar
ized by Professor Stuart. "The whole
responsibility for keeping out undesir
ables and maintaining the quota limi
tation upon eligible aliens is placed
upon the American consul," he said.
"Since the days of the depression, when
no alien liable to become a public
charge can be admitted, the consul's
work has more than doubled."
Although for many years the United
States paid little attention to picking
trained men for its representatives
abroad, today we have a foreign ser
vice of which no nation in the world
need be ashamed, according to Professor
Stuart. This, he said, is because career
men are replacing political appointees
in the country's foreign services.
