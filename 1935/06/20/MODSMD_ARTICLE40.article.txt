# Furniture Stolen From Gordon Davis' Home
## 
### 
Burglars visited the campus last
week-end and robbed the house of
Gordon A. Davis, former director of
dramatics, at 619 Lasuen.
Furniture in the front bedroom was
removed sometime between Friday
nigh l when Mr. Davis' mother and
sisters inspected it, and Sunday, when
Mr. and Mrs. William G. Heuer of San
Francisco, who had rented the house
for the summer, moved in.
Entry was apparently made by forc
ing open one of the bedroom windows
which opens off a patio. A visitor next
door reported hearing sounds Saturday
night but assumed it was the new ten
ants moving in.
