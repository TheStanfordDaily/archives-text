# DORMITORIES OPEN FOR SUMMER WOMEN
## 
### 
Two dormitories will remain open lo
accommodate women students during
the summer quarter. The Union, ac
cording to Miss Louise Price, director
of the Union Unit, will take care of all
undergraduate students, and the" grad
uate women will live at Mudrona.
Sixty-four women have stated their
desire for a university residence during
the summer quarter and there is ex
pected to be an increase in that number
before the first of the week. Forty-four
of the 64 are undergraduate women.
The usual house rules, with a little
modification, will remain in effect at
the Union. There will be no sponsors
in the undergraduate house, but Miss
Price, who will be in charge of both
living groups, intends to have some of
the old students help the new ones be
come acquainted with the household
system.
Madrona, which will be made up en
tirely of graduates, will be a "key"
house. The students will be allowed
perfect freedom, with the one exception
that all men must leave the house by
midnight. The graduate group will be
expected to elect a president and to
make any rules that might be neces
sary.
Board and room for students living in
the dormitories must be paid to Miss
Sanford in the administration building
today.
Both Lagunita and Roble will be
closed until next fall. Lagunita will be
opened for one week this summer in
order to accommodate approximately
150 men and women during the Educa
tional Conference, which will be held
from July 8 to 13. Three of the wings
will be used with one for married
couples and the other two for' un
