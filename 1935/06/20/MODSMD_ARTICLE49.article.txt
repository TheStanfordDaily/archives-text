# STANFORD CHARITY MANAGES ART GROUP
## 
### 
One of the Peninsula's well-known !
activities, the Allied Arts Guild of j
Menlo Park, has recently been taken ,
over by the Senior Auxiliary of the
Stanford Convalescent Home, Stanford's I
own unique charity.
The Convalescent Home, for under
privileged children, is maintained on
the campus by the generosity of stu
dents and alumni. The Allied Arts i
Guild is a group of handcraft artists !
gathered together at their center in j
Menlo Park. The two are now joined by
management of the Guild by the Con
valescent Home group.
The executive board which is now !
running the Guild is headed by Mrs. I
A. Douglas Mc√üryde, assisted by Mrs.
Charles Bransten, Mrs. Frank Buck, j
Mrs. Ira S. Lillick, and Mrs. Payson J. j
Treat. In addition to the executive J
board there is a small and expert staff ;
headed by Robert F. Ward, general
manager.
Since being taken over by the Home j
Auxiliary, the activities of the Guild |
have been somewhat expanded. The
tea and lunch room facilities have been
increased, a Mexican flower bafcaar has
been opened, and a group of small spe- j
cialty shops is projected.
