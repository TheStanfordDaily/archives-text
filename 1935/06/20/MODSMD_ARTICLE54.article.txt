# CONSTRUCTION OF NEW THEATER TO START IN OCTOBER
## $500,000 War Memorial To House School Of The Theater 
### 
Stanford's New Theater, the dream of
many generations of Rough and Co-ed,
will soon be reality. Ground will be
broken in October, and the theater will
probably be ready to house the pro
ductions of a revised Dramatic Council
in February of next year.
The New Theater, a $500,000 project,
will stand north of the Art Gallery
and across from the English corner, in
the space now occupied by a parking
lot. The auditorium will seat 1500, but
by an ingenious arrangement of dis
appearing walls the balcony and part
of the main floor can be blocked off,
thus reducing the capacity to that of a
"little theater" seating about 550.
In a separate room will be an even
smaller auditorium, a "toy theater"
seating slightly less than 200. This will
provide a sort of theatrical workshop.
In addition, the building group will
contain, a green room, various practice
and rehearsal rooms, make-up and
dressing rooms, various storage rooms
for scenery and costumes, and a shower
room for men.
The theater project will be financed
partly by student body fees and partly
by the War Memorial Fund. This fund,
now about $159,000, plus the Hammer
and Coffin Fund, will serve as initial
working funds. In addition, the stu
dents have voted to assess themselves
one dollar per student per quarter,
and a large percentage of the Union
profits will be devoted to the construc
tion. '
The University is expected to estab
lish a School of the Theater to take
advantage of the new and modern fa
cilities. This school will equal that of
any other college on the Pacific Coast
and bring Stanford to the fore in the
field of the drama.
The new theater, which will embody
a memorial to Stanford men killed in
the World War, will be named Me
morial Hall.
