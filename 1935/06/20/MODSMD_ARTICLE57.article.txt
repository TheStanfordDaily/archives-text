University Health Service safe

Health Service will treat temporary
ambulatory cases free of charge, but
each student is expected to select a
private physician on whom he may call
in case of illness.

campus for both men and women.
These are provided for students who
are temporarily in need of home condi

ill and do not require nursing and
medical attention.
