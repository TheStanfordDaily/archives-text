# HOOVER LIBRARY FINDS NEW PAPERS FOR WAR DISPLAY
## 
### 
One of the world's most valuable
collections of data on the World War
and the conditions arising from its
aftermath is housed in Stanford's Hoo
ver War Library, founded by former
President Herbert Clark Hoover.
During the past year the library has
proceeded with its collecting program,
which is concerned mainly with post-
Armistice problems. Among the val
uable acquisitions are a rare edition of
Belgian cartoons on the war, a large
number of the Bulgarian wartime pub
lications, and the complete files of "Lc
Petit Parisien" from 1902 to 1914 and
from 1916 to 1919.
Perhaps the most valuable of the
post-war collections was that having to
do with the New Deal in the United
States, This includes a complete set
of the press releases of the NRA from
beginning to date; a set of the Codes
of Fair Competition; a collection of
press releases of various private agen
cies and lobbying organizations in
Washington; and the "Congressional
Record" for the last two Congresses.
Files of a number of American po
litical newspapers have also been re
ceived, including the "American Prog
ress," Senator Long's private paper. A
complete set of the press releases of
the Reconstruction Finance Corpora
tion and a history of the corporation
were also received.
During the year special exhibits of
materials of interest to the public were
displayed in the library's exhibition
case.
Among these were an exhibit of books
black-listed by the National .Socialist
government, an exhibit of the war writ
ings of British literati, a display of
posters and leaflets issued during the
French riots of February, 1934, a dis
play of scientific and technical publica
tions during the World War, and an ex
hibit of the so-called "rainbow books"
published by the various belligerent
governments to explain their entrance
into the World War.
Stanford employs one staff member
to every four students.
