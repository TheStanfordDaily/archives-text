# Plans for Summer Quarter Explained by Dr. Mears
## Students Are Welcomed To Stanford By Director 
### 
Dr. Eliot G. Mears, director of
the summer quarter, welcomes
students to Stanford and tells of
some of the plans for the quarter
in the following message:
"With whole-hearted hospital
ity Stanford University wel
comes her summer students.
Some of you have been with us
in former years, and will quickly
feel at home again; some are con
tinuing on from the spring quar
ter, and are at once ready to join
in welcoming the newcomers, ex
tending to them genuine Stan
ford fellowship and friendliness.
"The members of the faculty
and administrative staff actively
wish that this summer term, with
many unusual opportunities, may

be a period of intellectual advancement
and wholesome recreation for the entire
student body.
"The summer quarter is an integral
part of the academic year. In no re
spect is the summer program a mental
"let-down" compared to those of other
quarters. In addition to those of the
regular staff who remain on duty,
many noted educators and leaders of
thought from other institutions will be
with us as visiting members of the
faculty.
Many Attractions
"At the same time, it is hoped that
students will not overlook the numer
ous attractions which add so much to
the summer life on the campus. While
the social and athletic group activities
typical of American undergraduate life
are at a minimum, most forms of sport
and recreation can be fully enjoyed by
students enrolled in Stanford Univer
sity for the summer quarter.
"Many will ask how they can spend
the weeks of the summer quarter to
best advantage. In the light of past
experience one can answer that the
student should wisely budget his time
and energies. Stanford and her en
virons offer sufficient allurement and
variety to satisfy the most fastidious
person. The Stanford Daily, published
twice a week, is the best medium for
keeping in touch with local news.
Series of Events
"Regular series of events which
should be noted are the special Tues
day evening entertainments, occasional
musical programs on Friday evening,
public lectures by members of the fac
ulty on Wednesday afternoons, organ
recitals on Sunday and Thursday, non-

I sectarian religious worship on Sunday
j mornings, and two or three University
assemblies.
"Two noteworthy new interests this
summer will form part of ihe regular
academic program. One is the Course
in Shakespearean Production, with
1 which will be included many extra
| curricular public readings, and lec-
I tures dealing with the Shakespearean
period, the whole culminating in sev
j eral productions of "Othello."
"The other is the Course in Art Ap
j preciation offered by the School of Let
ters. This course will be unique, be
j cause in addition to regular lectures
j by members of the faculty there will be
| visits to public and private studios, art
â–  galleries, libraries, and gardens, on
the peninsula, and attendance at con
certs of the best in music, including the
.symphony concerts given in the open
air Woodland Theatre at HilLsboro. In
I this way students will have opportunity
|to study the various arts under the
j guidance of trained critics.
"It is especially a pleasure, also, to
| announce the return of the Pro Arte
j Quartet, offering four concerts this
j summer. These conccrts will be given
j in the beautiful setting of the Memo
, rial Church, and through the gencr-
J osity of Mrs. Elizabeth Sprague Cool-
I idge will be open to the University
community.
"in closing, I would like to say to
each student enrolled in Stanford Uni
versity this summer:
"I sincerely hope you will find real
I satisfaction in your work, and healthful
I enjoyment in your hours of recrea-
I tion."


Dr. Eliot G. Mears
