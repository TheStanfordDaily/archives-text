# Fallacies of Food Poisoning are Explained
## Ptomaine Myth Revealed By Dr. Paul J. Beard In Radio Talk Bacteria Action Discussed In KGO Speech 
### 
"We are practically assured that no
such thing exists," stated Dr. Paul J.
Beard last night regarding ptomaine
poisoning. Dr. Beard, assistant pro
fessor of sanitary sciences, spoke on
the subject "Bacteria and Food Poison
ing" over station KGO on the Stanford
University Hour. The doctor stated
that in 145 autopsies performed on
subjects with a death certificate of
ptomaine, practically every other cause
of death was found to be present ex
cept ptomaine.

Tin Can Theory Exposed

Dr. Beard exploded another theory
of housewives when he upheld the in
ability of tin cans to contaminate food
after being opened. In past years metal
cans were believed to be impure; con
sequently, if food were allowed to
remain in them any length of time
after the cans were opened, it was
declared to be poisonous and was dis
carded. Modern scientific knowledge
has eliminated that fear of poisoning,
and food may remain indefinitely in
metal containers without danger of
contamination.
Refrigeration as Preservative
Several suggestions regarding the
treatment of refrigerated food were
given by the doctor, who cited refriger
ation as one of three of the most widely
used methods of preservation at the
present time. The others are chemical
treatment of preservatives, and can
ning. One of the most difficult prob
lems facing chemists in food research
today, according to Dr. Beard, is to
find chemicals that will kill bacteria
and at the same time be without effect
on human tissues.
Dr. Beard discussed bacteria which
"are much like people—there are all
kinds." In comparing botulism and tri
chinosis, he spoke of the former be
ing the more harmful due to its insidi
ous action and resistance to extermi
nation. "About 70 per cent of those
who contract botulism die. There is
little that can be offered in the way
of effective treatment once the symp
toms develop," he said.
In closing, Dr. Beard admonished the
housewife to discard the suspicious
food if she were in doubt.
