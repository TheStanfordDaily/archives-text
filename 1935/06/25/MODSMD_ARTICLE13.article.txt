Word I hit t Stanford's summer enrollment is again on the in
crease must ho good news to Director Mears and his stall'. In these
days of ever-increasing desire for more education, a university's
vitality might well he measured hv its summer school registration.
The truth of this statement is readily apparent when we Con
sider the composition of the summer (piartcr enrollment. An ex
tremely large percentage of this enrollment is composed of teachers
who are spending their summer vacation in work on a higher degree
or in adding to their preparation as teachers. This portion of the
summer enrollment at least should he fitted to judge the educational
standing of a university. If, then, a summer session can attract a
great number of these teachers, we have fairly good proof of that
school's rating.
For a school to he preferred hv these teachers is a good indi
cation that it holds the respect of those qualified to judge it, that
it ranks high nationally, and that its curriculum is attractive. These
teachers are not drawn by school spirit or social aspirations. They
are paying their money and spending their vacations in an ell'ort to
get something.
According to figures available after the first day of registration,
this summer's enrollment at Stanford has increased nearly 15 per
cent over that recorded at a similar time last year. Present ivgis-
Iratiyn is still of course far short of the figure reached in 1925), the
peak year, hut the important thing is that it is on the increase. As
Jong as this is the case, we can he certain that Stanford is retaining
its place in the educational world.
