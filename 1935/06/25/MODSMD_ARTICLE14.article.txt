Steady expansion of Stanford's physical plant is necessary to
keep abreast ol' the growlh in educational facilities. And summer
is the lime when most of the construction work is done. The Cor
poration Yard is busy making alterations and repairs. This year a
lolal of about .$84,0(10 is being spent for reconstruction and additions
on live fralernily and sorority houses.
Also, $20,000 will be spent to provide new quarters for Uni
versity janitors. Faculty members are spending at least $17,000
for new homes. Total building for the campus this summer is more
than $ 130,000.
Last year Lagunita Court was erected. It is hoped that work will
be under way next year on the $500,000 Stanford Memorial Theater.
Thus, every year Stanford adds to the attractiveness and usefulness
of its plant and at the same time does its share toward stimulating
business in the community.
