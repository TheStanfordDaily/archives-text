In sonic ways the American public is at its best at a sports event.
The American sympathy for the under dog. the insistent demand for :
fair play, and the-appreciation of real effort are almost proverbial. I
JSuI anyone who thrilled to the ovation .given .Jesse Owens, No. t I
track man of the world, last Saturday at Herkclcy saw an additional
side of the American nature and can well be proud to have been a
part of that exhibition.
Spectators forgot the meet as a whole in their interest in the one
man show. They forgot to pull for Stanford or California. They
forgot that Owens was of another race. They forgot to count team
points. They were interested in only one man. All their talk was
of him, and when he won—four times they applauded him with
all the admiration they felt. When the meet was over and it was
announced that Owens would try for a new world's record in the
broad jump, everyone in that crowd of 20,000 kept his seat, prob- :
ably the finest gesture of all.
Anyone who saw and fell the genuineness of thai crowd at
Kd wards Field must be proud of Americans in general.
