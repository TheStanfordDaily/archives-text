# A 						Pair of Customs
## 
### 
An <>I<l Stanford custom forbids smoking on I lie Quad. New
students don't know about it and old ones may have forgotten, but
it's ;i good tradition and let's honor it. If you feel like having a ;
cigarette just step down into the street.
Another custom has to do with getting and giving rides between
the campus and Palo Alto. If you have a car it is very little incon
venience to pick lip those who haven't and they'll appreciate it.
