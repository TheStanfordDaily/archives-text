Donneil, originator of the Daily's pop
ular column, "Bull Session," Associate 1

in '27, and now Editor of the Los An- '

POST MORTEM: Kate Smith is :
about the only person south of the
Arctic Circle who guessed right on the
outcome of the Baer-Braddock fight.
And she did it over the air, too, on
the night of the fight. . . . The station
break on the Fred Waring show that
night came about seven minutes early.
The fans turned their di;ils to NBC,
no fight, so back to Waring. Then they
stayed overtime. More listeners for
Ford. Clever, eh?

JUST RAMBLINGS: The 5&10 gals |
who spotted Mrs. Waley in Salt Lake
are doing personal appearances in a
theater there. ... A British firm (not
Lloyd's) is now insuring the success
of stage shows. . . . Congress is again
faced with the perpetual bill for a
government-operated broadcasting sys
tem. It hasn't a chance. . . . Wonder
what ever became of Will Osborne?
(You know, the guy that sounded like
Rudy Vallee.) . . . NBC's new Holly
wood studios cost 250 grand. (So
what?)
. . . AND ON: I like Fred Allen's
crack about the bird imitator who's
so natural you're afraid to look up. . . .
Jack Benny went to Hollywood to
make a picture called "Broadway Mel
ody of 1935," but it took so long to
: get started they've renamed it "Broad
way Melody of 1936!"
