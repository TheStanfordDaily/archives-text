"OIL FOR THE LAMPS OF CHINA"
At the Fox Stanford
This is a rather unusual picture jn
that it is one of the few converted from
a novel that still retains all the elements
that made the novel so popular.
Pat O'Brien leaves his '"wise guy"
I role and is a pleasing surprise as Ste
! phen Crane, the young idealist who
j sacrifices everything in striving to at
j tain recognition from "the company." ]
Josephine Hutchinson, as his wife, gives j
the "best performance of her brief ca- !
reer.
While it is claimed that the story is j
not aimed at any particular oil com
pany, the plot speaks strongly of the
Oriental activities of a certain large
I American oil firm and the ruthless !
manner in which they treat their cm- (
ployees.
' "HOORAY FOR LOVE"'
Also at the Fox Stanford
i '"Hooray for Love" is, unfortunately, j
merely a rehash of a rather trite and
time-worn plot—the trials of a young
Broadway play producer thwarted in
all his attempts, even at love. But "the
play must go on," and there's the usual
fadeout on a happy ending.
Gene Raymond is still trying to jus
tify his stardom, and Ann Sothern is
at last allowed to display a good sing
ing voice. Pert Kelton fails to amuse.
Best scenes are Bill Robinson's tap
dancing and Fats Waller at the piano.
