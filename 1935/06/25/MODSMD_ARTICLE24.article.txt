## Reflects Progress Made In Developing West 
### Russell Paine 
The California Pacific International
Exposition being held at San Diego
tfii , summer is a graphic demonstration
(.1' civilization in the* Southwest. The
motto of the Exposition, "built upon
a glorious past—dedicated to a glori
ous future," commemorates the found
ing of San Diego in 1542 by Juan
I.'odrigues Cabrillo and also reflects the
progress that has been made in the
phenomenal development of the Far
West.
The fair, which opened May 30 and
will continue until November 11, has
had an average daily attendance of
30,000. Interesting events are featured
each day, and special days such as
"Hoover Day" last Tuesday, when Her
bert Hoovfer was a visitor, are named
in honor of important personages or
occasions.
In many ways the San Diego Expo
sition is a smaller replica of the Chi
cago World's Fair, giving a glimpse
into the future of science,
but laying particular stress on western
developments such as the Hoover Dam,
the All-American Canal, the Grand
Coulee Project, and the great bridges
of Sari Francisco.
The buildings and grounds at San
Diego are very different from those
at Chicago. The natural setting of
Balboa Park formed a beautiful back
ground for the buildings and necessi
tated a minimum of forced planting.
The buildings themselves, many of
which have been standing since a for
mer fair of twenty years ago, represent
old Spanish architecture in its most
beautiful form, and are a marked con
trast to the futuristic designs at Chi
cago.
The exposition is groliped into three
main sections. The industrial and sci
entific exhibits are clustered around
the Plaza; the California State, the
Federal, and the Ford buildings, and
the Palace of Education, the Hall of
Fame, and others, are arranged along
the Avenida de Naciones; and in the
amusement or Zocalo area is a group
of exhibits corresponding to Chicago's
Midway.
