The Legal Eagles, an indoor baseball
i team made up of Stanford law students
: but strengthened by non-legal mem
! bers, has entered the Industrial Indoor
| League sponsored by the Palo Alto
Branch Y.M.C.A. Carl Abbot, who is
acting in the capacity of manager, has
I collected a well-balanced team.
The pitching staff is expected to be
one of the best in the league with two
such superior pitchers as Stan Mad
den and Fred Fletcher on the mound.
Dick Kelly, well known for his pitch
ing ability, was slated to pitch but re
signed upon the unexpected enroll
ment of Fletcher and Madden. Dick
Barbour and Bob Lawrence will han
dle the receiving department.
Harlow Rothert, Stanford's all
around athlete, will hold down the
initial sack. Jim Wooley and Hal Tur
ner should develop into a great com
bination at second and short providing
Turner is as adept in handling the
horsehide as he is with the casaba.
Third base will be held down by
Carl Abbot, the playing manager. Jack
Oatman, formerly a member of the
Stanford soccer team, will boot the
ball around in right field. Bingo "Slug
ger" Grant will play center field while
A1 Brent and Bill Keesling will alter
nate in the remaining pasture.
The team will practice three after
noons a week and Manager Abbot has
issued strict training orders so that
the campus should be fairly quiet
after 2 a.m.
