# COMPTROLLER ROTH RETURNS AFTER TWO WEEKS LEAVE
## Mexico City Host to Rotary International Delegates 
### 
Almon E. Roth, comptroller of Stan
ford, arrived home Saturday following
a two-week stay in and near Mexico
City where he attended a convention
of Rotary International, at which 6,000
delegates attended from 70 countries.
Leaving June 10 at 4:30 o'clock in the
morning, he traveled by air along the
coast and Lower California as far as
I Mazatlan and then inland to Cuerna
vaca, a resort which is about 40 miles
| from Mexico City, arriving at 6 o'clock
that evening. The distance is about
i 3,000 miles.
j There he remained for a week before
going to Mexico City where the con
vention was held. Remarking about
| the hospitality of the people, Mr. Roth
said, "We were wonderfully enter
tained and well housed."
Entertainment Excellent
Included on the program was an
address by the president of Mexico,
as well as musical and dancing num
j bers. The entertainment features far
j surpassed any convention he had ever
i attended, Mr. Roth declared.
| He explained that delegates were
j invited to private homes to dinner ev
i ery evening. Dinner began at 11 o'clock
| in the evening and lasted until 1:30 or
2 o'clock. Then the members were
' expected to be up early i'or morning
sessions.
The host could catch up on sleep the
| next day in his siesta, Roth said, but
! the delegates just had to get along the
best they could on very little sleep.
Mexican Conditions Better
j Speaking of conditions in Mexico,
Mr. Roth particularly noted the ab
j sence of beggars on the streets. Also,
j he said, the convention witnessed the
only peaceful change of government in
the history of the country.
Mexico is a country of contrasts,
and it differs more from the United
States than does Europe, he said, add
ing, though, that the people with whom
i they came into contact were, however,
"delightfully civilized."
To show this contrast he related an
incident which he observed of a Mexi
can and his servant going unarmed to
the bank, heavily laden \vith money.
"The country between Mazatlan and
Mexico City was most gorgeous," he
said. While in Mexico City he visited
the archeological formations which
have been uncovered of the Toltecs, a
race which apparently preceded the
Aztecs. Most interesting, he said, were
the pyramids which had been com
pletely covered over with earth, and
the open-air temples.
"I really feel that the convention did
a great deal to promote good feeling
between the countries," Mr. Roth con
cluded.

Almon E. Roth, comptroller of Stan
ford, arrived home Saturday following
a two-week stay in and near Mexico
City where he attended a convention
of Rotary International, at which 6,000
delegates attended from 70 countries.
Leaving June 10 at 4:30 o'clock in the
morning, he traveled by air along the
coast and Lower California as far as
I Mazatlan and then inland to Cuerna
vaca, a resort which is about 40 miles
| from Mexico City, arriving at 6 o'clock
that evening. The distance is about
i 3,000 miles.
j There he remained for a week before
going to Mexico City where the con
vention was held. Remarking about
| the hospitality of the people, Mr. Roth
said, "We were wonderfully enter
tained and well housed."
Entertainment Excellent
Included on the program was an
address by the president of Mexico,
as well as musical and dancing num
j bers. The entertainment features far
j surpassed any convention he had ever
i attended, Mr. Roth declared.
| He explained that delegates were
j invited to private homes to dinner ev
i ery evening. Dinner began at 11 o'clock
| in the evening and lasted until 1:30 or
2 o'clock. Then the members were
' expected to be up early i'or morning
sessions.
The host could catch up on sleep the
| next day in his siesta, Roth said, but
! the delegates just had to get along the
best they could on very little sleep.
Mexican Conditions Better
j Speaking of conditions in Mexico,
Mr. Roth particularly noted the ab
j sence of beggars on the streets. Also,
j he said, the convention witnessed the
only peaceful change of government in
the history of the country.
Mexico is a country of contrasts,
and it differs more from the United
States than does Europe, he said, add
ing, though, that the people with whom
i they came into contact were, however,
"delightfully civilized."
To show this contrast he related an
incident which he observed of a Mexi
can and his servant going unarmed to
the bank, heavily laden \vith money.
"The country between Mazatlan and
Mexico City was most gorgeous," he
said. While in Mexico City he visited
the archeological formations which
have been uncovered of the Toltecs, a
race which apparently preceded the
Aztecs. Most interesting, he said, were
the pyramids which had been com
pletely covered over with earth, and
the open-air temples.
"I really feel that the convention did
a great deal to promote good feeling
between the countries," Mr. Roth con
cluded.
