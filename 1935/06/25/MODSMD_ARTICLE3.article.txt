# Visitors Left in Dark at Wilbur's First Reception
## 
### 
President Ray Lyman Wilbur kept
I his word about making his Friday
| evening "at home" strictly informal.
I For unforeseeen electrical difficulties,
j resulting in abrupt absence of light,
| turned the reception into slightly un-
I usual lines. Thus many visiting pro-
I fessors and students received their
j first and rather dramatic impression
J of the way Dr. Wilbur lives.
| Candles were resurrected to light
! the drive and the long ascending stair
j way, and the solemnity of the mansion
was transformed to a glowing choco
j late birthday cake, proclaiming to all
[ that lights may go out in the best of
I places.
So complete and effective was this
| transformation that those who arrived
j late mistook a catastrophe for an in
! tentional display for artistic effect.
| Butlers bowed low with flashlights
I and familiar faces were dimmed in the
soft glow of candle-light.
