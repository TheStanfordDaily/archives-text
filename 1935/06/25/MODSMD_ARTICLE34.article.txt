Students who enter college at 16
years of age make the best gi'ade aver
ages.
Students whose mothers attended
college but whose fathers did not, show
better performance than do those
whose fathers attended college and
whose mothers did not.
Such are findings of E. J. Howell, of
Texas A. & M. College, recently pre
sented before the American Associa
tion of Collegiate Registrars at North
Carolina.
Conclusions reached by Mr. Howell,
in his study of economic and social
backgrounds of 1,153 engineering stu
dents, are:
Students from the group of smallest
schools made the best showing. Stu
dents from the next group made the
poorest showing; thereafter "success
increases with the size of the school."
Students from the professional fam
ilies stand highest in rank.
The success of students increases ac
cording to size of family "up to six,"
then it decreases. There is a 60-40
chance for superiority in the case of
the oldest child.
