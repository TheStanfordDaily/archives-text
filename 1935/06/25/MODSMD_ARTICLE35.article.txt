# Palo Alto Hospital's Fiscal Record Bright
## 
### 
Prospects for the Palo Alto Hospital
making an exceptionally good showing
this fiscal year are blight, judging by
the record of operation so far available.
During the first 11 months of the
year gross operating income was $144,-
254.82 and total expenses, including
interest on equipment, were $123,634.96,
giving a net operating profit of $20,-
619.86, according to data received by
E. S. Erwin, auditor of Stanford, which
operates the hospital for the City of
Palo Alto. This compares with the fig
ure of $17,195.86 for the corresponding
period last year.
This month will see the end of the
payments made on purchase of equip
ment. When the hospital was erected
Stanford University advanced $37,500 to
cover the cost of buying essential
equipment, on the agreement that the
sum be repaid in five years. The debt
has been discharged in three years.
For the month of May the hospital's
total income was $18,239.40. Expenses
for the month totaled $13,726.36. The
net operating income is therefore $4,-
513.04.
Occupancy for the month is given as
2,174 patient days, as compared with
a capacity of 2,590 patient days, or 84
per cent. For the 11-month period the
average occupancy was 62 per cent,
which compares with 47 per cent in
the preceding year.
The epidemic of German measles
among Stanford students is believed
mainly responsible for the unusually
high occupancy this year.
The University grounds comprise
about 9,000 acres.
