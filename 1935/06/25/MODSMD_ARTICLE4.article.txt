# German Topic of Lutz Talk
## Speaks to Commonwealth Club After Return From European Trip Concedes High Importance Of Recent Revolution 
### 
"I hud previously under-estimated j
. the significance of the German revolu- 1
| tion and the statesmanship of Adolf i
| Hitler," said Professor Ralph H. Lutz
[ in opening a talk on "Present Condi- j
tions in Germany" given before the I
• Commonwealth Club in San Francisco
;on Friday. Professor Lutz has just 1
1 returned from a three months' visit in j
Germany and other European coun
tries.
Dr. Lutz pointed out that the revo- j
' lution has now developed to a point 1
I ihat all other peoples must take a J
I stand toward it, for today no one be- |
! lieves that it will disappear. Its fun- j
damental ideals have revolutionized I
the German people as well as the gov- j
eminent.
Overcame Communism
He added that the German revolu- j
tion overcame the menace of com- ;
munism. Germany was drifting toward !
it and the Nazis maintain that com- j
munists at the time were only waiting j
for the hour to strike. However, the
people were not forced to accept the
National Socialist doctrines; they were
persuaded by an army of young mis
sionaries who worked among the peo
ple and won them over to the German
cause. In no other country have so
many people been won over from
communism.
The internal struggle in Germany !
following the war came to an end j
in 1933. There has come a unification ,
of classes and parties, and where there
were 36 parties today ihere is one.
"Americans have criticized the Na
tional Socialists from two points of
view: first on the destruction of de
| mocracy and second on their policy to
' ward the German Jews," said Pro
' fessor Lutz. He explained that con
j stitutional liberty as Americans know I
| it. is suppressed, but here there is a j
j conflict of ideals. The Germans speak j
! of the French Revolution in a way that |
jno one else would dare. A German
I official at a private lecture for foreign
j press correspondents claimed that
I" 'freedom of the press' is just a slogan
i invented by the enemies of Germany.'
' Professor Lutz added, "Of course any
! one familiar with Anglo-Saxon his
tory of the 18th century cannot ac
cept such a statement."
As to the second criticism, ihe anti
.semitic movement, he pointed out that
this is a concept foreign to Americans.
Hitler has taken steps to remove them
I from their position in business where
; they had places of prominence, but the
1 great industrialists have not suffered
' severely. "It is not the present treat
ment," he said, "so much as the policy
I that they shall be refused all partici
pation in public affairs in the future."
He talked with a wealthy Jewish in
| dustrialist who said to him, "Tell the
I Americans to forget us. We have been
I through it before and can take care
i of ourselves."
Many Accomplishments Made
Professor Lutz pointed out the fol
lowing six accomplishments of the
National Socialist government to date:
1. The nation is unified. Internal
' conflict is over and the unity is a new,
democratic unity.
2. The national psychology has
changed from one of despair to one
of confidence in the future of the na-
I tion.
