# Stanford, Cal Tie For Third Place At Meet
## Owens Alone Responsible For High Score Placing Ohio Second Indians Place in Five Events But Get No Firsts 
### 
After thja enthusiasm over Jesse j
Owens, great negro athlete from Ohio i
State, had cooled off at the N.C.A.A. !
meet held last Saturday at Berkeley ]
and team standings were computed,
I Stanford was found to have scored I
20 points to tie with the University of :
California for third place far behind
j the 74 1-5 points amassed by the U.S.C.
! Trojans and the 40 1-5 points almost \
! entirely contributed by Owens for the
benefit of Ohio State.
Owens' four first places far over
shadowed a meet in which the greatest
athletes of the country were partici
pating. No world's records were bro
ken by him or others, but the times j
( were very satisfying considering the j
'.stiff wind which faced all runners.
Stanford placed in five events but i
failed to win a single first place. Most
disappointing event of the meet to
Indian backers was Sam Klopstock's
loss of his high hurdle title to Sam j
Allen of Oklahoma Baptist. Klopstock
took the barriers in fine form but failed
i to match the speed of Allen between
hurdles. At the finish Klopstock barely
managed to nose out Phil Cope of
U.S.C. for second place. The time of
14.7 was very fast considering the
strong head wind.
Johnny Mottram added another j
I eight points to the Stanford total when ■
he placed second to Charles Gongloff i
of Pittsburgh in the javelin. His best !
! throw was made in the qualifying !
I trials.
• In the discus Phil Levy failed to !
reach his earlier season marks and
was able to account for only a fifth
place, 5 feet behind the leaders. Jim
I Reynolds in the shot also fell short of
' his best marks and managed to pick
j up only one point for a sixth place.
Humbert Smith accounted for the
1 final point in the Indian total when
he tied with two others for fifth in the
high jump.
Dud Sales in the javelin was the only j
| Stanford man to qualify in the pre- j
j liminary events who failed to place in •
the finals. Captain A1 Blackman had
collapsed in his heat of the 440 after j
appearing to have recovered his last
season's form during the early part of
the race. The only other event in
j which Stanford had figured to place
j was the low hurdles. Klopstock was i
j scratched in this event in the hopes
j that he could retain his N.C.A.A. title
in the highs by concentrating on that
! race alone. Stanford's sprinters failed
| to place in the qualifying heats.

After thja enthusiasm over Jesse j
Owens, great negro athlete from Ohio i
State, had cooled off at the N.C.A.A. !
meet held last Saturday at Berkeley ]
and team standings were computed,
I Stanford was found to have scored I
20 points to tie with the University of :
California for third place far behind
j the 74 1-5 points amassed by the U.S.C.
! Trojans and the 40 1-5 points almost \
! entirely contributed by Owens for the
benefit of Ohio State.
Owens' four first places far over
shadowed a meet in which the greatest
athletes of the country were partici
pating. No world's records were bro
ken by him or others, but the times j
( were very satisfying considering the j
'.stiff wind which faced all runners.
Stanford placed in five events but i
failed to win a single first place. Most
disappointing event of the meet to
Indian backers was Sam Klopstock's
loss of his high hurdle title to Sam j
Allen of Oklahoma Baptist. Klopstock
took the barriers in fine form but failed
i to match the speed of Allen between
hurdles. At the finish Klopstock barely
managed to nose out Phil Cope of
U.S.C. for second place. The time of
14.7 was very fast considering the
strong head wind.
Johnny Mottram added another j
I eight points to the Stanford total when ■
he placed second to Charles Gongloff i
of Pittsburgh in the javelin. His best !
! throw was made in the qualifying !
I trials.
• In the discus Phil Levy failed to !
reach his earlier season marks and
was able to account for only a fifth
place, 5 feet behind the leaders. Jim
I Reynolds in the shot also fell short of
' his best marks and managed to pick
j up only one point for a sixth place.
Humbert Smith accounted for the
1 final point in the Indian total when
he tied with two others for fifth in the
high jump.
Dud Sales in the javelin was the only j
| Stanford man to qualify in the pre- j
j liminary events who failed to place in •
the finals. Captain A1 Blackman had
collapsed in his heat of the 440 after j
appearing to have recovered his last
season's form during the early part of
the race. The only other event in
j which Stanford had figured to place
j was the low hurdles. Klopstock was i
j scratched in this event in the hopes
j that he could retain his N.C.A.A. title
in the highs by concentrating on that
! race alone. Stanford's sprinters failed
| to place in the qualifying heats.
