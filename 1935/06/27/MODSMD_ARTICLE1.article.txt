# Lecture Series on Elizabethan Period Opened
## England's 'Commoner Queen' Discussed by Fenton Last Night Her Non-Marriage Explained On Political Grounds 
### 
The political and religious situation
in England at the time Elizabeth as
cendcd the throne was described by
Frank Fenton in his lecture on "The
Commoner Queen," given last night in
the Women's Clubhouse.
As is well known, the Virgin Queen
never married, and Mi*. Fenton dwelt
on the reasons for her not wedding
James Stuart or King Philip II of
Spain, both of whom wexe among her
suitors. Elizabeth refused Philip be
cause that would have joined England
and Spain more closely than the queen
would have liked, according to the lec
turer. ALso, such a union would have
precipitated another clash between the
Protestants and the Catholics, who
were already very bitter toward each
other.
Complex Married Life
In telling about the other Tudor rul
ers, Mr. Fenton spoke in some detail
regarding the very complex married
life of Henry VIII. Henry ascended
the throne only because his elder
brother, Arthur, Prince of Wales, died.
Arthur had been married to Catherine
of Aragon, Spanish princess and daugh
ter of Ferdinand and Isabella, rulers of
Spain. A few years after Arthur's
death, Catherine was married to the
new ruler, Henry VIII.
Elizabeth's importance to the Shake
spearean age, which coincides with her
reign, cannot be overemphasized. In
fact, the Shakespearean and Eliza
bethan ages are synonymous. The
queen did much to aid Shakespeare in
his writings and productions, and is
remembered gratefully in English lit
erature because of her contributions
to the writer.
Reigned Until 160.']
Queen Elizabeth reigned until IGO3,
when the throne passed by her order
to James VI of Scotland, who became
James I of England. Thus began the
Stuart line.
Mr. Fenton's talk inaugurated a se
ries of eight lectures on Shakespeare's
time in connection with the Shake
spearean course given by William
Thornton. These lectures will be held
on consecutive Wednesday evenings
during the summer quarter.
