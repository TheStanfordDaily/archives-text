# Cathcart Talks On Constitution And New Deal
## Decisions of Supreme Court On NRA Are Subject Of Lecture Professor Tells of Famous Cases and Acts 
### 
"An American dictator is impossible
without a revolution or a constitutional
amendment," said Professor Arthur M.
Cathcart of the law school in his "lec
ture on "The Supreme Court and the
New Deal."
The group gathered in the Assembly
Hall last Tuesday evening heard Pro
fessor Cathcart review the decisions
handed down by the highest court in
regard to New Deal and recovery legis
lation. Quoting from both majority
and minority decisions, he traced the
confident rise and unexpected fall of
New Deal support in the Supreme
Court.
Blow to New Deal
After stating the purpose of the Con
stitution and the Supreme Court, Pro
fessor Cathcart proceeded to cite the
"hot oil" case, the gold clause case,
the moratorium law, the compulsory
railroad pension act, and the NRA.
Upon the NRA decision depended in
a large measure whether the Constitu
tion should be abolished or retained,
and it was purely upon a constitutional
basis with no reference to emergency
or social need that the unanimous de
cision of "unconstitutional" was handed
down. That this waij an expected blow
to the confidence of the New Dealers,
stated Professor Cathcart, was evi
denced by the fact that the New Deal
legislation was rushed through Con
gress with little regard for constitu
tionality.
Powers Checked
Although the liberal majority of the
court had upheld New Deal legisla
tion in previous decisions, the entire
court in a unanimous decision on the
famous NRA "chicken case" checked
the extensive and unprecedented pow
ers that Congress had granted to the
chief executive, and returned the Con
stitution to its former status of "the
supreme law of the land."
