# Idealism in Politics
## 
### 
I hose ol us who are about to leave college and Assume the duties
of a citizen in some community should watch eloselv the progress
of Hie new Iv organized San Franeisco center of the Order of Cin
cinnatus. Here at first hand we can see an organized attempt by
young professional men to inject some of tlie idealism and sense
ol fair play of youth into corrupt municipal governments of the
country.
Composed of young men picked for their leadership in the com
munities, the order lias already firmly established itself in Wash
ington and Oregon and is organizing now in San Francisco. In
Seattle Hie mother chapter has succeeded in electing many of its
members to municipal offices.
Non-partisan in character and no! interested in the current
European political "isms," the order is organized solely to promote
intelligent civic progress and to clean up municipal politics by elect
ing intelligent and progressive youth to the offices that have so long
been corrupted by the evils of the party machine with its patronage
and graft.
In San Francisco the various bodies of young men interested in
good government arc being co-ordinated and organization being
started in order that intelligent leaders may be picked and properly
backed in a program of civic progress. Although it is not contem
plated at present, the prospect of the spread of this spirit to state
ami national government is something to think about. Meanwhile
it is a good tiling to watch.
