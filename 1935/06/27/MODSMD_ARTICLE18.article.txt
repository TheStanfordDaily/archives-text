"Romantic" is a trite and mild word with which to describe the
atmosphere surrounding the song recital to be given Friday night

something glamorous about entertainment in the open air under
California's famous sky. The singer will be in Spanish costume and
special lighting arrangements will add to the ell'ecliveness of Un
set ling.
