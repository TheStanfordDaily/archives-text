because The Rambler got three items 1
from this month's issue when he read
it yesterday . . . '!First, an answer to
our own query in Tuesday's column:

playing at the Hotel Lexington in New
York. (Saw that one in an ad.) , . . ,
1!" College women are overstuffed in
tellectually and starved emotionally"—
Professor Carl S. Joslyn, sociology in
structor at Harvard, in the column
"Faculty Minds." But professor, you
mixed a metaphor! . . . "And "Life" j
reminded us that the month's best gag
was the parody of an old nursery rime |
in the Columbia "Jester":
Rich man,
Poor man,
Fraternity brother.

PHONEY STUFF* "Oil for the Lamps |
of China" had a New York oil company |
executive phoning the Shanghai office.
Can't be done; China is one of the few j
countries to which there is no service.
MUSIC NOTES: Tom Coakley may
return to the Palace in September. Un
til then, "When you hear thp violin,
THATs Paul Pendarvis." . . . liThey !

come to the Mark after all. If he !
doesn't, Henry King will stick till Griff
Williams returns in the early fall . . .
Green has the knack of writ
ing unusual and distinctive tunes. His
latest, "How Can I Hold You Close '
Enough?" is another that has That Cer
tain Something.
THE RAMBLER is slightly piqued
that the Pro Arte Quartet should give
