# Thornton Reveals Hopes for Theater Future
## "Othello" Director Relates Early Stage Experience And Tells Aims 
### 
"I experienced a tremendous thrill
appearing as a professional on the same
stage that I had as an amateur, and
I found my name still scribbled on the
wall backstage," said William Thornton
in response to a question as to how it
seemed to appear last year on the stage
on which he had worked while a stu
dent at Stanford.
William Thornton left Stanford to be
gin his career as an actor on the pro
fessional stage in 1926. Since then he
has had experience acting with the
Pasadena Community Players as well
as with Walter Hampden's pei'manent
repertoire company. In 1929-30 he was
featured as both actor and director for
the Shakespeare Guild of America.
Thornton was playing in Los Ange
les when he received his opportunity
with Hampden. He had previously
written him asking for a chance in case
of an opening. It was while he was
playing "Hamlet" in 1928 that Hamp
den wired him to come to New York.
During the season in Manhattan he
played "Cyrano de Bergerac," which
ran 19 weeks on Broadway, and "Ca
pansacchi," as well as other plays. In
1929 he toured New England with
Hampden's repertoire company.
When asked what Shakespearean
character he liked to play most, Thorn
ton replied that it was hard to choose.
The first character of the season seems
always to be the actor's favorite. His
favorites last year were King Lear
and Richard 111, both parts having
added to his reputation. However, he
admitted that he finds playing a reper
toire the easier work, playing a differ
ent character each day. He particularly
enjoys working on the road.
Mr. Thornton is finding the teaching
here quite enjoyable. He is attempting
to give the class a bit of the atmos
phere of the professional stage, and he
has abandoned the regular classroom
style of working, preferring to seat the
students around a table. Thus each
meeting appears as a regular rehear
sal. The acting class is starting work

j on the Shakespearean play "Othello,"
! which will be presented in mid-August,
j William Thornton has one great am-
I bition. He woutd like to see a Shake
j spearean company subsidized as pres-
I ent-day municipal orchestras are. Be
j cause of the great expense involved
in producing a Shakespearean work, it
is almost impossible for the ordinary
\ director to cast one. The expense might
run up into the thousands of dollars.
He suggested that this movement
might well grow up in universities,
| and that a college group such as the
| Stanford class might be used. This

j idea was carried out in Shakespeare's
day, when students produced perfor
mances and presented them through
out the land. In this way the people
playing the part would be particularly
well trained.
When asked what lie thought of the
new theater project, Thornton said he
believed Stanford was in need of a
new theater. However, he hopes that
: when the building is being constructed
! the advice of someone well versed in
; theatrical building will be obtained, to
i provide for the proper acoustics needed
1 for theatrical work.
