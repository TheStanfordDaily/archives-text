# WOODLAND THEATER TO PRESENT NINTH ANNUAL SERIES OF OPEN-AIR CONCERTS
## San Francisco Symphony Will Start Season's Programs Next Sunday 
### 
The Woodland Theater in Hillsbor
ough occupies a unique position in the
musical fabric of America.
There, under California's blue sky
and within the shelter of Hillsborough's
hills, music lovers from San Francisco,
the East Bay cities, and the Peninsula
communities will assemble on the Sun
day afternoons of June 30, July 7 and
21, and August 4, to hear the San
Francisco Symphony Orchestra play
masterpieces by representative ancient
and modern composers under the lead
ership of four of the world's most dis
tinguished conductors.
Because of its atmospheric charm and
the beauty of its setting, the Woodland
Theater has been pronounced the most
ideal natural amphitheater that this
country affords.
The development of the Philharmonic
Concerts at the Woodland Theater from
an experiment in summertime musical
activities to an institution which brings
the standard orchestral repertoire, as
well as important novelties, thou
sands of music lovers each season is a
matter of nine years.
The inception dates back to 1926
when a group of socially prominent
women were inspired by a vision. They
dreamed of having symphony concerts
on the Peninsula under their own aus
pices.
Realizing the possibilities of the
Woodland Theater as a center of cul
ture and art, and being fired with en
thusiasm and energy, these women set
out to bring about the fulfillment of
their dream. So they founded the Phil
harmonic Society of San Mateo County,
which sponsors the Peninsula's sum
mer festival of symphonic music.
Since its inception, the Philharmonic
Society has brought to Hillsborough 23
of the world's most famous batons—
Nikolai Sokoloff, Henry Hadley, Alfred
Hertz, Ossip Gabrilowitsch, Henry
Eichheim, Bruno Walter, Albert Coates,
Bernardino Molinari, Eugene Goossens,
Ernest Bloch, Gaetano Merola, Artur
Rodzinski, Willem Van Hoogstraten, E.
Fernandez Arbos, Walter Damrosch,
Sir Hamilton Harty, Pierre Monteux,
Alexander Smallens, Frederick Stock,
Richard Lert, Howard Hansen, Fritz
Reiner, and Jose Iturbi.
This year four concerts will be pre
sented. Alfred Hertz, San Francisco's
own beloved symphony conductor, will

wield his baton at the opening concert
Sunday afternoon.
The seccnd concert of the season, on
July 7, will mark the return to the
Woodland Theater of Richard Leii,
Viennese conductor of symphony and
opera fame. Mr. Lert was formerly
conductor of the State Opera in Berlin
i and conductor of several of Germany's
major symphony orchestras, including
! the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra.
Harold Bauer, pianist, will be the
guest soloist upon this occasion, play
ing the Schumann A Minor Concerto
for piano and orchestra.
Adhering to its policy of introducing
each season a musical personality new
to Woodland Theater patrons, the Phil
harmonic Society will present Basil
Cameron, one of England's best known
' conductors. Mr. Cameron, who con
ducted the San Francisco Symphony
Orchestra in two of its winter seasons

The Woodland Theater in Hillsbor
ough occupies a unique position in the
musical fabric of America.
There, under California's blue sky
and within the shelter of Hillsborough's
hills, music lovers from San Francisco,
the East Bay cities, and the Peninsula
communities will assemble on the Sun
day afternoons of June 30, July 7 and
21, and August 4, to hear the San
Francisco Symphony Orchestra play
masterpieces by representative ancient
and modern composers under the lead
ership of four of the world's most dis
tinguished conductors.
Because of its atmospheric charm and
the beauty of its setting, the Woodland
Theater has been pronounced the most
ideal natural amphitheater that this
country affords.
The development of the Philharmonic
Concerts at the Woodland Theater from
an experiment in summertime musical
activities to an institution which brings
the standard orchestral repertoire, as
well as important novelties, thou
sands of music lovers each season is a
matter of nine years.
The inception dates back to 1926
when a group of socially prominent
women were inspired by a vision. They
dreamed of having symphony concerts
on the Peninsula under their own aus
pices.
Realizing the possibilities of the
Woodland Theater as a center of cul
ture and art, and being fired with en
thusiasm and energy, these women set
out to bring about the fulfillment of
their dream. So they founded the Phil
harmonic Society of San Mateo County,
which sponsors the Peninsula's sum
mer festival of symphonic music.
Since its inception, the Philharmonic
Society has brought to Hillsborough 23
of the world's most famous batons—
Nikolai Sokoloff, Henry Hadley, Alfred
Hertz, Ossip Gabrilowitsch, Henry
Eichheim, Bruno Walter, Albert Coates,
Bernardino Molinari, Eugene Goossens,
Ernest Bloch, Gaetano Merola, Artur
Rodzinski, Willem Van Hoogstraten, E.
Fernandez Arbos, Walter Damrosch,
Sir Hamilton Harty, Pierre Monteux,
Alexander Smallens, Frederick Stock,
Richard Lert, Howard Hansen, Fritz
Reiner, and Jose Iturbi.
This year four concerts will be pre
sented. Alfred Hertz, San Francisco's
own beloved symphony conductor, will

wield his baton at the opening concert
