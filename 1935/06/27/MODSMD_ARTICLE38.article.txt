# N.E.A. CONVENTION TO OPEN IN DENVER
## 
### 
When educators from all parts of the
j country meet in Denver, Colo., during
I the week of July 1 to attend the Na
tional Education Association conven
tion, Stanford will be represented by
three delegates. Dr. Harold C. Hand
and Dr. Paul R. Hanna, professors of
| education, will be assisted at the con-
I vention by Otto W. Bardarson, presi
! dent of the California Elementary
i School Principals' Association.
Because they are both teaching
| courses at Stanford, Dr. Hand and Dr.
| Hanna will fly to Denver and will stay
; only for the sessions at which they are
i presiding.
Dr. Hand is chairman of the evening
meeting on July 3, at which "The
Teacher as a Citizen" will be the topic
for a speech by Dr. Hand. He intends
to take the stand that all educators are
entitled to and should avail themselves
i of full rights of citizenship, instead of
being denied that right as they often
are now.
Dr. Hand says: "War is the alterna
' tive to reason—we dare not gag our
teachers, for we are at a severe crisis
■ with reference to keeping schools open
& i intellectually. If the youth of today
I! are to become free self-governing citi—
j zens capable of discrimination and in
| dependent judgment, they must early
I j and rigorously be trained in the free
I j use of tlfeir intelligence.
Ij "To expect to develop free citizens
[j capable of intelligent inquiry, keen dis-
I crimination, and independent judgment
II in schools and colleges staffed by teach
ijers who are browbeaten, uncritically
rj obedient, and who dare not think for
j themselves is obviously to expect the
| impossible."
j Dr. Hanna will speak before a gen-
I j eral group at the first general session
( on the evening of July 1. His address
Ij will be especially directed to adminis
i trators and elementary school princi
j pals.
j | Dr. Hanna's point will be an argu-
II merit for the combination of practical
' and theoretical education, especially in
' secondary schools. Dr. Hanna says:
"Formal education in school has been
almost entirely out of books. Pupils
and students should see things first and
read about them afterwards. If this
system were followed in our schools,
the student would get much more (
meaning from his reading.
The general sessions will be held in '
the evenings, leaving the mornings and
afternoons open for small panel and
j group discussions. A vesper service
will open the conference on Sunday
and banquets and luncheon meetings
for small groups will be frequent to '

make possible closer contact and freer
exchange of ideas.
More than 10,000 workers in the field
of education are expected to attend the
conference, and 1,000 to 1.500 are ex
pected to be present at each panel.
The major events of the conference
will be broadcast over the NBC net
work.
