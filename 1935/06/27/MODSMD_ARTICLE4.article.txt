# BARBOUR LECTURE IS GIVEN TONIGHT

The Peking Man was a girl! At least
that was the decision of the experts
for the first six months after the pre
cious skull was discovered. Then they
found a .mate also a half million years
old. The mate's skull was more deli
cately shaped, indicating definitely that
[ the first skull found had been that of a
: man.
Dr. George B. Barbour will give an
(ilJustrated lecture tonight at 8 o'clock
I in the Little Theater on the "Finding
of the Peking Man." The substance
; of the talk was first given by Dr. Bar
| bour before the British Association for
i the Advancement of Science at. a spe
cial meeting called to hear a report on
I the progress of the significant discov
' eries 45 miles from Peking.
Dr. Barbour holds degrees from tfie
! Universities of Edinburgh, Cambridge,
and Columbia, is a fellow of the Royal
Society of Edinburgh, and is a member
! of geological societies of America, Eng
land, France, Finland, and China. He
is best known in scientific circles for
a memoir on the section of the Mon
; golian border and for a series of stud
ies on the loess and other physiographic
problems of China.
This is believed to be the first oppor-
I tunity offered to local residents to hear
'a first-hand description of the circum
! stances related to the finding of the
Peking Man, by one intimately asso
ciated with the remarkable finds.
