# Dr. Newell Tells X-ray Uses in Radio Address
## Increasing of Ray Usages Cited in NBC Address Last Night Big Contribution Seen In Cancer Work 
### 
Although the X-ray has been an im
portant factor in the advancement of
medicine it is often given too much
weight, since it is only one part of a
medical examination, Dr. Robert R.
Newell told his NBC audience on the
Stanford Radio Hour last night. He
called attention to the fact that the X
ray specialist with his training and
ability, rather than the machine, is
the dominant factor.
"From the doctors' standpoint the
important thing is that you can cast
shadows with the X-ray. And they are
so penetrating that you get the shadow
of the inside structure as well as the
outside form."
Artificial Contrasts
Dr. Newell explained how the doctor
uses strategy to produce a shadow of
organs whose surroundings absorb X
rays and so make them indistinguish
able. This is accomplished by intro
ducing. an artificial contrast. Barium
sulphate is used to reveal the gastro
intestinal tract, and the shadow is
usually thrown on a fluorescent screen
to study the organs at work before the
permanent X-ray film is made.
Dr. Newell told how it was possible
to drain the brain cavities of their
cerebro-spinal fluid through a needle
and put air in its place. By this method
it is possible to make an X-ray photo
of the brain.
X-irays Expensive
"X-rays are very new (about as old
as the automobile). The automobile,
with millions of buyers, gets cheaper
and cheaper,, while X-ray installations,
with a few hundred buyers, get better
and more expensive,'* said Dr. Newell.
He continued: "For medical pur
poses X-rays and radium are the same
thing. But radium is little and cold and
can be put inside the body or close
against its surface. And X-ray is big
and powerful and relatively cheap, so
that it is convenient to use for irradia
tion at a distance of a foot or more."
In speaking of X-ray as a cure for
cancer Dr. Newell said: "By far the
most important therapeutic use of X
ray is for cancer. But the terrible thing
about cancer is that it comes so often
to diagnosis too late for successful re
moval."
Cancer Treatment
"X-rays and radium in large doses
cbstroy tissue. Fortunately many tu
mors are more susceptible than the
tissues in which they lie, so that a
priper dose of X-ray may destroy the
tumor and yet not do fatal injury to
the patient."
Dr. Newell believes that it is worth
the risk of injuring cancer patients
with an overdose of X-ray or radium
treatment since the disease itself is so
dange.ous. He claims that these treat
ments are seldom the immediate cause
of death.
In telling how the voltage used in X
ray was raised from 1.30,000 to 200,000
volts the speaker said he was sure no
one would disagree if he advised mak
ing the doctor rather than voltage our
first consideration.
