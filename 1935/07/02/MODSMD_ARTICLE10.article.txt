# 600-lb "Girl" Found Under Campus Porch
## 
### 
Workmen dismantling a fraternity
house on the Row recently found under
the porch a heavy marble statue of
a coy lass clutching a flag about her
self. Six of them strained and heaved
to get it out on the lawn. No sooner
had they accomplished this than the
police arrived and began an inquiry.
"We got no record of anyone missing
a statue, but it was probably stolen.
Where'd you get it?" they asked.
The boys couldn't say offhand, but a
little research into the fables of the
tong revealed that two of the brethren
were dipping their mustaches into the
foam one evening long ago and took
quite a fancy to the stone charmer.
After considerable elbow bending they
decided they couldn't live without her,
and the two of them hoisted her up and
toted the 600 pounds of her back to
the house.
"Lord," muttered one of the six per
spiring workmen, "what a brew that
must have been!"
