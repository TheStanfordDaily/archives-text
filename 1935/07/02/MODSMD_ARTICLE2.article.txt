# Drinking Water This Summer's Campus Gripe
## 
### 
With the coming of summer, campus
opinion gripes have turned to Univer
sity drinking water.
Under an undecipherable name, the
following short note was turned in to
the editorial offices yesterday:
"Dear Editor: As spokesman for a
group of students, we would like to
know if the drinking water is taken
directly from the Encina swimming
pool, or if it goes through the Roble
pool first."
The queer taste complained of come*,
according to the engineer's office, from
chlorine put in the water to purify it.
The queer smell noticeable on lawns
and other irrigated property comes
from bluestone and lime placed in the
irrigating water to keep it clear.
Water used for irrigation purposes
comes from Searsville Lake, while
drinking water, despite its taste, comes
from the University's own artesian
wells.
