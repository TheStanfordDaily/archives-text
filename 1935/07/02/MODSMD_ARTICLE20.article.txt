Slimmer quarter at Stanford is usually a dca(l space in the
athletic year. There aren't enough living groups represented to
gel up an intramural league in anything. To all'ord the campus
some entertainment and allow anyone interested to compete ath
letically here during the summer, Harry Maloney has announced
tournaments for registered men students. They're all strictly
novice so anyone who knows anything at all about the events is
urged to sign up. Prizes will be given to winners. Let's get behind
this program and have some exercise and a lot of fun. Sign up-at
the gym.
