ONE OF THE outstanding comedy
successes of the current New York dra
matic season, '"Three Men on a Horse," I
opens in San Francisco next Monday.
The play revolves around a meek,
downtrodden little suburbanite, a
writer of greeting card poetry, who i
finds that he has an unfailing knack for
picking the winners in horse races. ,
What happens when three race track
touts find out about him, when they ,
take him in hand, get him drunk, write
his verses for him, and hold him pris
oner until his genius fails, provides an
evening of old-fashioned, clean-cut
farce.

AND HAVE YOU HEARD about the
cow that drank a bottle of ink and
mooed indigo? (There; now that's*'
over.)
ORVILLE KNAPP. rumor hath it,
will bring his sobbing saxes and twang- i
ing guitar to the Frantic not far hence.
.. . The Rambler, being an ex radio '
columnist, can't resist the temptation to
call to your attention the twice-weekly
concerts of the Pro Arte Quartet on
KGO. Monday and Thursday from
3:30 to 5.
FLICKERING FRAMES: Jane Fro
man cured herself of stammering in
six days to win a movie contract from
Warner Brothers. .. . British Interna
tional will film an old British musical
comedy, "Lilac Domino," in the fall.
Take The Rambler's word for it: the
I score equals anything Friml ever did.
