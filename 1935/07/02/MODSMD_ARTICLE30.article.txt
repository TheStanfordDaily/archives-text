"NO MORE LADIES"
At the Fox Stanford
Joan Crawford,' Robert Montgomery,
Franchot Tone, Charlie Ruggles, and
Edna May Oliver do their best, but
their best is none too good in this not
up-to-scratch picture.
Perhaps the .main fault is the trite
plot: modern young man and woman
enter marriage knowing chances are
against them; modern young man
Jstrays;; m.y.w. dittoes for revenge;
tearful reunion and clinch in the final
fadeout.
Treatment, of the theme shows the
Legion of Decency influence.
