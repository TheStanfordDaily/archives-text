# AUDIENCE ENJOYS SUNDAY SYMPHONY
## 
### 
Music lovers received a pleasurable
thrill on Sunday afternoon at the first
symphony concert of the season held
in the outdoor Woodland Theater at
Hillsborough. San Francisco's own Al
fred Hertz wielded the baton on this
occasion and was given a hearty wel
come by the very appreciative au
dience.
Rare Suite Played
Beginning with the merry* * in d hu
morous overture to '"The Bartered
Bride" by Smetana, the orchestra
continued with Tschaikowsky's rarely
heard Suite No. 3, in G major, opus 55.
This suite in four movements was com
posed in 1884, and played for the first
time by the Russian. Musical Society at
St. Petersburg in 1885.
Saint-Saens' "Rouet d'Omphale,"
which followed the intermission, is a
very delicate and moving symphonic
poem. Many people came especially to
hear the next selection, a prelude, "The
Afternoon of a Faun," by Debussy.
This prelude, based on a poem by Ste
phane Mallarme and composed in 1892,
delicately traces the happenings caused
by a condition bordering on wakeful
ness and dreaminess.
Only Summer Concerts
Alfven's Swedish Rhapsody, "Mid
sommarvaka," concluded Sunday's
concert. This composition aptly re
flects- the festival which is still cele
brated in parts of Sweden on Midsum
mer Eve, June 24-25. Alfven's work is
a true musical portrayal of this festive
time in the Swedish peasant life.
These symphony concei'ts are pre
sented by the Philharmonic Society of
San Mateo County and enjoy the dis
tinction of being the only symphony
concerts presented in northern Califor
nia during the summer months. Found
ed in 192G, this is the tenth annual se
ries of concerts.
Next Sunday will note the return to
the Woodland Theater of Richard Lert,
Viennese conductor of symphony and
the opera, who was seen here last year.
Harold Bauer, pianist, will be the guest
soloist at this concert.
