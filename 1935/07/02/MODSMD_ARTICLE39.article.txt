# Barbour Tells of Finding Remains of Peking Man
## 
### 
Dr. Barbour in his lecture on the
Peking Man last Thursday evening
gave a vivid description of the finding i
of this memorable ancestor who is un
doubtedly close to the main lineage of
modern man.
The lecture revealed the extensive- j
ness of the excavations which are still
being made and which promise to
throw further light upon the precise
character and relationship of this pre
historic type.
The audience had the unique oppor
tunity of handling the actual quartz
tools and implements fashioned by man
half a million years ago.
The lecture closed with a remarkable
film of the site and the army of men \
engaged in the work.
