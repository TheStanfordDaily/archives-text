# Prominent Actors Chosen For Cast of "Antigone"
## 
### 
A cast of well-known campus actors
and actresses htfs been chosen to in
terpret the roles in Sword and Sandals'
reading of Sophocles' "Antigone" next
Friday evening in the Little Theater.
This famous classical tragedy, a fa
vorite since its first production in 442
8.C., combines poetry and drama in a
way that makes possible a most im
pressive performance. The several in
teresting and distinct characters will
be capably portrayed by such expe
rienced actors as James Sandoe, as
sistant to Thornton; Sydney Head, star
of many Community Theater produc
tions; Robert Dwan; and Hugh Baker.
The title role will be read by Dorothy
Tully, leading actress in several Stan
ford productions a few years ago.
Amelia Baines as the sister of Anti
gone, and Annelies Morgan as Eury
dice, wife of the king of Thebes, are
the other women in the play.
The chorus, an essential feature of
Greek tragedy, has been shortened and
arranged by Charles Denny, the direc
tor, to meet the limitations of a formal
reading in which the musical back
ground for the odes is impossible. Wil
liam Gwinn, remembered as the Doc
tor in last summer's comedy, "The
Doctor's Wife," and Delbert JefTers
, take the parts of the chorus, which has
[ a dramatic as well as a lyrical function
!in the play.
i Admission is free.
