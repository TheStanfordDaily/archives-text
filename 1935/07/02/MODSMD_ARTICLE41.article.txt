# Roaming Thru The San Diego World's Fair

### Russell Paine 
Included in the San Diego Exposition
are 65 buildings, exhibits, or other
j points of interest. To see any or all of
these the visitor may walk, go to va- ;
| rious points via serpentine busses, or j
hire a roller push-chair. Guides are
available for the tourist who wishes to
i make a hurried trip through the fair,
j Complete programs of music, special i
1 entertainments, and lectures are also i
j scheduled daily in addition to the regu
lar exhibits.
The first large building confronted j
inside the main entrance is the Palace :
of Natural History with its California
I fauna, plants, birds, mammals, marine |
j animals, insects, fossils, and minerals. !
Among the exhibits is a 40-foot long
! duck-billed dinosaur.
Next one approaches the Palace of
j Foods and Beverages in which, if he
' has spent a long time in the previous
building, he is prepared to work up a
i good appetite looking at the hundreds
| of varieties of modern foods, ranging
! from honey to sausage, from rolls to
: chewing gum. If samples secured from
I the different shows do not suffice, the
j visitor may eat lunch within the buiid- !
! ing.
Across the way then, is the Palace of I
Better Housing containing suggestions ;
of landscaping and building. Furniture, ;
i gas and electrical appliances, plumbing i
I fixtures, and other household articles
I are on display. In the rear of this -
| building is a model town of miniature
| homes, which stand less than three
j feet high.
Next to the Palace of Better Housing
! is the House of Hospitality, where vis
! iting notables are received. It includes
| lounges, a roof garden, a reception
i room (Casa del Oro), an auditorium, a
l patio, and a cafe.
Then proceeding by the organ amphi
! theater in the direction of the Ford
Building the fair-goer may see some
|of the most interesting parts of the
fair, including the Palace of Educa
tion, the California State Building, the
Federal Building, the Standard Oil
Tower to the Sun, the Palace of Elec
tricity and Varied Industries, the Hol
lywood Motion Picture Hall of Fame,
the Palace of Water and Transporta
tion, the Ford Music Bowl, and the
Firestone Singing Fountains.
Within the Federal Building are ex
tensive displays representing many of
the departments and commissions of
the government. In the Post Office De
partment exhibit the preserved form of
Owney, former postal mascot dog which
traveled 143,010 miles and received
j 1,017 medals, is shown.
. I On the way back to the Plaza the
i | visitor may stop in the Telephone
; j Building for a little entertainment in
the way of sound. A device which
scrambles speech into a strange gib
berish in order to give privacy to trans
oceanic telephone conversations is dem
onstrated in one corner. It operates by
transmitting the high notes of speech
into low notes, resulting in strange
scrambled sounds. Thus "mashed po
tatoes" comes out sounding like "South
Dakota"; "get the hook" sounds like
"what the heck," "San Diego" sounds
like "Don Lye Abie," "I love you"
sounds like "El yed we," and "ladies
I and gentlemen" comes out as "yodels
and Flanagan."

|of the most interesting parts of the
fair, including the Palace of Educa
tion, the California State Building, the
Federal Building, the Standard Oil
Tower to the Sun, the Palace of Elec
tricity and Varied Industries, the Hol
lywood Motion Picture Hall of Fame,
the Palace of Water and Transporta
tion, the Ford Music Bowl, and the
Firestone Singing Fountains.
Within the Federal Building are ex
tensive displays representing many of
the departments and commissions of
the government. In the Post Office De
partment exhibit the preserved form of
Owney, former postal mascot dog which
traveled 143,010 miles and received
j 1,017 medals, is shown.
. I On the way back to the Plaza the
i | visitor may stop in the Telephone
; j Building for a little entertainment in
the way of sound. A device which
scrambles speech into a strange gib
berish in order to give privacy to trans
oceanic telephone conversations is dem
onstrated in one corner. It operates by
transmitting the high notes of speech
into low notes, resulting in strange
scrambled sounds. Thus "mashed po
tatoes" comes out sounding like "South
Dakota"; "get the hook" sounds like
"what the heck," "San Diego" sounds
like "Don Lye Abie," "I love you"
sounds like "El yed we," and "ladies
I and gentlemen" comes out as "yodels
and Flanagan."
Included in the San Diego Exposition
are 65 buildings, exhibits, or other
j points of interest. To see any or all of
these the visitor may walk, go to va- ;
| rious points via serpentine busses, or j

available for the tourist who wishes to
i make a hurried trip through the fair,
j Complete programs of music, special i
1 entertainments, and lectures are also i
j scheduled daily in addition to the regu
lar exhibits.
The first large building confronted j

of Natural History with its California
I fauna, plants, birds, mammals, marine |
j animals, insects, fossils, and minerals. !

! duck-billed dinosaur.
Next one approaches the Palace of
j Foods and Beverages in which, if he
' has spent a long time in the previous
building, he is prepared to work up a
i good appetite looking at the hundreds
| of varieties of modern foods, ranging
! from honey to sausage, from rolls to
: chewing gum. If samples secured from
I the different shows do not suffice, the
j visitor may eat lunch within the buiid- !
! ing.
Across the way then, is the Palace of I
Better Housing containing suggestions ;
of landscaping and building. Furniture, ;
i gas and electrical appliances, plumbing i

! is the House of Hospitality, where vis
! iting notables are received. It includes
