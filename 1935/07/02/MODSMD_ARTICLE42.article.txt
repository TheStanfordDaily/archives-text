# Tourists Visit Stanford From All Parts of World

Approximately 110,000 tourists got
off of busses and craned their necks at
: the mosaic on the chapel front duiing
I the last year, according to Warren j
Rockwell, who, as student guide, has \o j
point out the mosaic and tell them j
that it came from Italy.
On Sundays and holidays about 600 1
can be expected, he says. The average |
week day brings around 200 people, i
This is exclusive of the private parties j
i coming in their own cars.
Most of them are from out of the
| state, but one and all want to know
where the Herbert Hoover home is.
Rockwell has a formula for this.
Questions run all the way from an
i inquiry about the life of a plant in the
botanical gardens to "did he know Joe
j Jinks who was here in 1920?" A year
I as student guide has given Rocky a
| poker face and a list of all the answers,
| however, and he sends them away with
j a lot of information they didn't have
before and some he didn't have him
! self.
They come from all over the world,
i he says, but the Australians are the
most consistent in the questions they
ask. It seems that Thomas Welton Stan
; ford came back from Australia and en
j dowed a chair for psychic research. All
! the Anzacs want to be sure that this
endowment is being spent correctly,
J and one insistent gentleman held up
| the bus while he combed the psychol
i ogy department to check up. An elderly
lady from Melbourne even asked if she
! could see the chair.
