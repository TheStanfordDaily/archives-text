# Alsberg Tells About Pacific Peace Moves
## United States, Japan Could Gain Nothing From War Policy Advises Trade Co-operation Between Countries 
### 
"Neither Japan nor the United
States has anything to gain by fight
ing," Dr. Carl Lucas Alsberg of the
Stanford Food Research Institute said
today.
Dr. Alsberg recently returned from
Tokyo, where he attended a meeting
of the International Research Commit
tee of the Institute of Pacific Relations.
This committee, with Dr. Alsberg as
chairman, is doing research in prob
lems concerning international friction
in the Pacific Basin. All members of
the institute were represented at this
meeting except Russia, France, and
New Zealand.
Competitive Power
The main subject of the discussion
was how differences in standards of
living influence competitive power in
international trade.
In speaking of Japanese-American
relations Dr. Alsberg said, "The log
ical policy between Japan and the
United States would be to work out
some co-operative trade arrangement,
because the United States is the largest
market for raw silk. On the other
hand, Japan is one of the principal
buyers of raw cotton, tobacco, and
wheat when the price is right."
Production Discussed
Dr. Alsberg continued: "We produce
things the Japanese have to have and
Japan produces silk, which we have to
have and I see no reason why an ar
rangement could not be worked out be
tween the United States and Japan
that would be mutually advantageous."
Dr. Alsberg was told by the Japanese
that they do not own Manchukuo, but
that Japan is merely helping it to stand
by itself.

Dr. Alsberg said, "They were beauti

Clara Valley."
This meeting was held at Tokyo be
cause of its central position and one of
its objectives was to make a tentative
arrangement for the program of the
general meeting of the Institute of Pa
cific Relations to be held some time
next summer or fall in California.
