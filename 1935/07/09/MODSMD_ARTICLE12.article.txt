Peggy Converse, Stanford graduate
who began her dramatic career in
campus productions under Gordon
Davis and finished it five years later
under Harold Helvfenston, will take im
portant parts in the two plays consti
tuting the July Dramatic Festival at the
University of California.
In tonight's performance of "The
Taming of the Shrew" at the Greek
Theater in Berkeley, she takes the role
of Bianca. Peggy Wood, star of the
London and Broadway stages, will play
Kathcrina, and Polio Peters, remem
bered for his Romeo to Jane Cowl's
Juliet, will be Petruchio. On July ID
she will play the feminine lead opposite
Peters in Sean O'Ca.sey's controversial
drama, "Within the Gates."
Peg Randall Converse has had two
separate dramatic careers at Stanford.
In the years prior to her graduation in
1927, she starred in many productions
under the direction of Gordon DaVis,
then director of dramatics.
She was just Peg Randall then, but
after her graduation she. married Ed
mund Converse, '28. Then in the fall
of 1931 she and her husband returned to
Stanford for graduate work, and she
resumed her dramatic activities, this
time under Director Harold Helvcnston,
appearing opposite Vallojo Gantner in
"Berkeley Square" and "RomOo and
Juliet."
The Drama Festival productions will
be under the direction of Julius Evans,
one of the most successful of New
Yolk's younger directors.

A small grass fire behind the B.A.C.
building was promptly extinguished
last Friday by the campus fire de
partment.
