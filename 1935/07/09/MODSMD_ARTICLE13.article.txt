Ihe conference, whose purpose is a
! consideration oi basic problems funda
mental to administration, has brought
to the campus outstanding leaders who
are engaged in this work.
I'ancl Discussions
! Because of the success attained by
I the use of the panel discussion in pre
i vious conferences the same general
I plan is being followed this year. Dean
' Kefauver believes more satisfactory
| results are obtained in this way than
| from a series of speeches with general
' discussions.
Members of the audience are given
! an opportunity to express their views
; from the floor. In this way freedom of
intellectual inquiry and expression, an
| element vital in the life of a university,
j may be secured, according to Dean Ke
i fauver.

Members of the educational con
-ference have been granted full
student privileges on the Uni
versity golf course and swimming
pools.

j The purpose of the opening meeting
| held yesterday afternoon was to out-
I line the historical development of the
: administrative function, and to set up
! the problems facing the school admin
: istrators. Under the chairmanship of
' Dr. Jesse B. Sears, Dr. John C. Al
i mack traced the historical develop
ments.
Traces Development
He pointed out the two important
j responsibilities of administration, the
j legislative and the executive functions,
j Originally these were performed by the
j board of trustees or by the principal
ior master. Then in the early part of
the 19th century the office of super
intendent appeared. By 1920 the func
i tion of the administrator had been al
-1 located to various ofiices in the better
organized cities.
Dr. Almack then traced the stages in
the development of the superintendent.
The three stages were sumrrted up as
the clerical, the "big business," and
; finally the scientific or engineering
.stage. All of these types are yet in
existence. *
"The next battle will be between the
state and local unit. Education will
, hold its vigor and strength by being
kept near to those it serves." Dr. Al
mack stated in conclusion.
Following the historical presentation
Dean Grayson N. Kefauver spoke on
"The Task of School Administration."
Many of the present problems have ex
isted for years, he pointed out.
"The pyst quarter of a century has
been a period of remarkable develop
ment." Dean Kefauver said, "and the
j changes in the future will be more
i rapid. This social will present many |
' problems to the school."
Changes Needed
Quoting from an article by Dr. Cub
berley written in 1909, Dr. Kefauver i
I showed that many of our present-day j
j problems were recognized at that time.
However, he pointed out that the 1
I changes in society have outdistanced |
| changes in the school.
Administrators should develop wide
spread understanding "of 'the amount of !
[ education appropriate for a democracy |
and the school should contribute toward j
| a realization of the ideals of a democ- 1
1 racy.
Educational leadership implies so- j
! cial leadership. A program should be
{ shaped which will prepare for present !
j and probable future needs of a demo
! cratic social life.
Pointing out the fact that many mi
j nority groups are seeking to control the '
1 school for their own ends, Dean Ke
| fauver expressed the belief that admin-

I istrators should seek control of educa- j
i tion in order that they may build up a
j body of public opinion which will re- !
sist the pressure of such groups.
Especial stress was placed upon the !
, problem of maintaining a stall at the ]
highest point of professional efficiency.
An organization must be maintained
' which will allow teachers to develop a
; high professional standard. This in
j volves sufficient income to live on a
I cultural level, a security which will !
I eliminate worry, and an active partici
i pation in matters of administrative
j policy.
