# Open the Post Office
## 
### 
Why can we not have the post ollice left open at night during
Summer Quarter? It does seem annoying that summer students
are made to suller for the desecration committed last quarter by a
lew thoughtless, inconsiderate men.
Surely the visiting teachers and graduate students who com
pose the majority of our summer enrollment can be trusted in flic
post ollice after dark.
II I lie authorities who closed the doors arc not willing for the
building to be open during regular school session, they might at
least lilf the Iran during these brief summer months for the digni
fied visitors who grace our campus at this time.
After *llending the many and varied cultural lectures provided
wilhiif the next few weeks, would it not be pleasant if they could
drop by their post-boxes for mail?â€”K.L.H.
