# Educational Standards

### 
Probably I lie most encouraging sign of the awakened realization
on the pari ol the educational profession that a high professional
standard is the best way to ward oIV the attacks is the increased
summer school enrollment.
Kducators need lo realize that the best way to meet (he on
slaught is to make themselves a body of workers whose activities
arc thoroughly respected. Our ideals have usually been upheld, but
100 often our work has been ridiculed. Certainly these people who
are enrolled in our summer session will be able to carry to their
tasks a deeper understanding of their problems, and will seek to
solve them in a manner that will enforce a greater sympathy for
their efforts. Ji.A.L.
