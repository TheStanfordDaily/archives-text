# Summer Campus Dances
## 
### 
How about some campus dances this summer? There seems to
be none scheduled, and surely two or three would do much to
enliven the quarter's social festivities.
Nol only would a few dances give those regular students en
lolled this summer much pleasure, but it would all'ord those visiting
an opportunity to observe a phase of Ihe I niversity's regular social
aeti\ ilies. â€” K.L.B.
