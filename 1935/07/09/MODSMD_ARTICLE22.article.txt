"DOUBTING THOMAS"
Fox Stanford
Will Rogers ,as amiable as ever, rol- '
licks his way through "Doubling 1
Thomas.'' supported in talented man- j
ner by such luminaries as Billie Burke j
and Allison Skipworth.
The plot, it.s probability and the like, !
is relatively unimportant in a film of j
such hilarious tempo. Suffice it to say. j
it is concerned with the antics of a I
local impressario (Allison Skipworth) I
of the avoirdupois female brand, and
her venture into the realm of amateur j
theatricals. How the Brown family be
comes involved in this is shown in
most amusing manner. Mr. Brown
(Will Rogers) is in constant conflict :
with his wife (Billie Burke) who is
suffering from "delusions of artistry." ;
The son of the family is having the j
same trouble with his fiancee. What i
follows is most comical.
The picture, of that brand which Fox 1
considers "the good Roger picture" is !
very engaging despite the strange dis- j
crepancy of urbane Billie Burke and ,
blundering Will.
