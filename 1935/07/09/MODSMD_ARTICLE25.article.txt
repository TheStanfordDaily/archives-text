# ORVILLE GOLDNER TELLS OF WORK ON PRODUCTIONS
## Stanford Technical Director Started Career With Marionettes 
### 
"I was interested in the theater but
I wanted to be the whole thing." It
was for this reason that Orville Gold
ner, technical director and designer,
took up marionette work as a hobby
which later developed into a profes
sion.
Before going into his present work
Orville Goldner did extensive work in
marionette production with Blanding
Sloan who has accomplished much as
a designer for Ziegfeld and Carroll.
The two created the Shack Marionette
Theater in San Francisco and in 1926
they were the only marionette players
in the United States to have their own
theater.
History of Marionettes
Mr. Goldner emphasized the fas
cinating character of marionette his
tory, pointing out that marionettes
Â» play a vital part in the history of the
theater in certain parts of the country
not only as entertainment for children
but dramatically.
In 1928 Mr. Goldner became designer
for the Kinex studio in Hollywood and
since then has done work in technical
direction for the Paramount studios.
However he says, "I wouldn't go out
of the way for a job in pictures at
present," although he admits that he
enjoys the work as much as anything
else for it is a creative and changing
field.
Workod on Exposition
Mr. Goldner did considerable work
on the present California-Pacific In
ternational Exposition at San Diego as
assistant to the art director before
coming here. He is responsible for the
designing of the State Building and
the Palace of Education. When asked
his opinion of the fair he modestly an
swered "the grounds and location are
beautiful."
Mr. Goldner further pointed out that
the exposition has done San Diego a
great deal of good economically. It
grew as a stubborn child and has far
surpassed expectations. He added that
the hard part of the work there was
due to the scarcity of craftsmen, as it
was necessary to send to Hollywood
and Los Angeles for them.
Will Direct Othello
This summer's work at Stanford as
technical director and designer is Gold
ner's first experience teaching in a
school although he has done teaching
independently before. He is enjoying
the work a great deal and thinks that
Stanford wouldn't be such a bad place
to teach permanently.
Mr. Goldner and his class will be
responsible for the technical produc
tion of Othello which is to be put on
by William Thornton's acting class late
this quarter.
