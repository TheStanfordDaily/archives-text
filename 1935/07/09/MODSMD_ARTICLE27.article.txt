SAM KLOPSTOCK
BREAKS RECORD

j little hurdler, established a new world's
record of 14.1 for the 110-meter high
hurdle at the Amateur Athletic Union's
| track and field championships at Lin
, coin, Neb.
The former record for the distance
was held by Percy Beard at 14.2 sec
: onds. Klopstock beat Beard in a pre
liminary hurdle heat and in the finals
Beard took second and Phil Good of
I Bowdoin third.
! Because of a breeze blowing at the
time of the race the record may not be
i allowed.
