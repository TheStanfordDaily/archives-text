# Second Record Program Of Quarter Played Today
## 
### 
The second record program for the
[Summer Quarter will be given this
afternoon at 4:15 o'clock in Room 84.
j The Cesar Franck Quartet, which ap
pears on the Pro Arte Quartet program
| this evening, will be played, also the
Bach arrangement from "The Art of
j Fugue."
New masterpieces released during
the month of June are to be played,
beginning with Bach's "Musical Offer
ing" on a theme by Frederick the Great,
arranged by Edwin Fischer. A string
orchestra gives a rendition of this music
as little known as the "Art of Fugue."
Beethoven's famous "Kreutzer" So
nata, opus 47, played by Hephzibah
and Yehudi Menuhin, is one of the
finest recordings of Ihe year. The per
formance is probably quite different
from the first one, given by Beethoven
Vith the Negro-English violinist,
Bridgetower.
Tlie Symphony in B Flyt Major by

Chausson, played by the Paris Con- J
servatory Orchestra, brings a work |
that is obviously inspired by the com- !
poser's teacher, Cesar Franck.
Some lighter numbers include the j
Funeral March of a Marionette by |
Gounod, and Paganini's Moto Ferpetuo i
(Allegro di Concerto), played by the !
Minneapolis Symphony, Eugene Or- !
maridy conducting, and Mendelssohn's ;
Ruy Bias-Overture, played spiritedly j
by the 8.8.C. Symphony Orchestra.
Hereafter programs will be given on i
Wednesdays as well, at 4:15 o'clock, j
Tomorrow's program will include the i
numbers for which there may not be ;
time today, and some masterworks
which had to be postponed from last
Tuesday.
Tansman's* "Tryptique" is one of the i
most modern chamber works recorded |
lately. Three well-differentiated move- j
ments on two records are full of well- '
scored music, played by the St. Louis
Symphony Orchestra.
Rossini's overture, "La gazza ladra" '
makes us realize what kinship this j
gifted composer might have had with >
Mozartâ€”in spite of his gay superfi- j
ciality. 1
