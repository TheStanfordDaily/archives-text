### 
The second Philharmonic Society
concert of the season Sunday found
two world-famous musicians offering
an uynu.sual and diversified program to
a capacity audience at the Woodland
Theater. Richard Lert, native of Vi
enna, was guest conductor, and Harold
Bauer, pianist, was the soloist.
This concert marked the return to the
theater of Mr. Lert, who conducted the
San Francisco Symphony Orchestra
here last year. Mr. Lert, famous in
â™¦he musical circles of Berlin and The
Hague, is fresh from operatic triumphs
in Washington, D.C.
Weber's Music
Mr. Bauer, recognized as the au
thority on the music of Robert Schu
mann, selected that composer's Con
certo in A Minor for his solo.
Opening with Weber's moving yet
brilliant overture to "Euryanthe," the
orchestra continued with the Good
Friday Spell from "Parsifal."
Friday Spell from "Parsifal." Brahms'
Passacaglia (Last Movement from
Fourth Symphony), next on the pro
gram, proved to be an earnest and
stately development of an ancient
dance form.
Next Concert July 21
Mr. Lert next conducted the orches
tra through a spirited and lively ren
dition of Bizet's Suite No. 1, from "Car
men." The concert concluded with the
overture to "Die Fledermaus" by
Johann Strauss. Although Strauss
wrote nearly 400 'waltzes, he also com
posed several operettas. One of these
is "Die Fledermaus," and the overture
is typically Strauss in his most lilting
form.
These Woodland Theater concerts,
presented by the Philharmonic Society
of San Mateo County, are now in their
tenth season. The next concert will
be July 21, at 3 p.m., with Basil Cam
eron of England as the guest conductor.
