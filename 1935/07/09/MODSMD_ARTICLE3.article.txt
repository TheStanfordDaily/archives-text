## 
### 
Rumor has it that the Stanford team
is going Hollywood. So, U.S.C., sit up
and take notice, for the boys are mov
ing in on the movies.
Keith Topping, Stanford's towering
end, has recently gone south with his
pal, Bob O'Conner, another former
Stanford star. Coach Ernie Nevers is
making some pictures this summer and
landed the jobs for these players. What
a break for the kids to see '"Tops"
J Topping in a cowboy suit.
Some of the team members are really
working this summer. Bob Black is
cutting wood in the Sierras and will
be in trim to give them the axe at
guard this fall.
Jacks-of- All-Trades
Jack Clark, an end, and Joy Hold
ridge, half, are working in the oil
fields near Ventura. Carl Schott is
laboring in the old fields at Taf-t.
Monk Moscrip, all-American per
former at end, went home to visit his
family in Adena, Ohio, and it is re
ported he will return to the campus
soon.
Jimmy Coflis and Bob Dakan, a
couple of likely looking prospects up
from last year's frosh team, are doing
p. little prospecting in a mine at Plaoer
ville.
Ray Todd, the quarterback who hob
bled his way.to fame in the Big Game,
is working for the Los Angeles Gas
Company.
Around Home
Frank Alustiza, stocky quarterback,
has returned to the campus, where he
will be employed for the remainder of
the summer by the B.A.C. Frank will
give Stanford's opposition plenty to
worx-y about this year.
Earl Hoos, if great back, is working
for the B.A.C. on the Stanford golf
course. Earl should be getting some
valuable practice dodging golf balls,
which he should use to advantage this
fall on the gridiron.
