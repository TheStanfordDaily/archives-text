Tudor Aristocrat Described
The Tudor aristocrat in ail his bril
liancy of wealth and education was de
scribed by Frank Fenton in his lecture
last Wednesday. Learning and birth,
as well as great material wealth, were
the requisites for the newly rich aris
tocracy of that period.
The magnifico delighted in an orna
mented prose style just as he did in
dress and conversation, and the cour- I
tier had to be graceful in his carriage i
and manner, as well.
Attesting to her love of display and 1
magnificence, Elizabeth had 3000 gowns
in her wardrobe at the time of her
death. One of her greatest pleasures j
was derived from traveling around the
kingdom with her vast entourage.
Dcficit Led to Piracy
A deficit in the English treasury
made Elizabeth approve of privateering I
and especially of Francis Drake. Her
profit in the success of Drake's voyage
around the world amounted to Â£1,400.
His swift and surprising defeat of the
Spanish Armada in 1588 made the Eng
lish feel that they were one of the
great nations of the eai'th.
"The influence of Elizabeth and the
men she gathered around her extended
on down to the Restoration," concluded
Mr. Fenton, adding that the queen was
the ''greatest magnifico of the lot."
