# Air-Minded College Group Makes Local Airport Hum
## 
### 
Stanford rales high in the field of
! local aviation, as evidenced by the
! showing of Lieutenants John Preston
and John Kelly in the air circus held
at the municipal airport last week.
The two former Stanford students won
first and second prizes in the acrobatic
i flying contest at the exercises dedicat
ing Palo Alto's new airport.
Further indication of Stanford's su
premacy is the fact lhat Stanford stu
dents hold the distinction of being the
most air-minded college group in the
United States. A total of 500 flying
hours a quarter, or 1500 per year, is
the school's record. This surpasses the
record held by the University of Min
nesota, but is unofficial, however, for
the local flying school is separate from
the University.
Outstanding among the local flying
group is Lieutenant Preston who, as
chief training pilot, has initiated many
i Stanford students to flying. He says
"College students learn faster, as evi
denced by the fact that the average solo
time on this field is six hours, whereas
on most fields it's between 8 and 10."
Comparatively few of the students
plan to follow commercial aviation,
however, as most of them fly merely
for pleasure.
