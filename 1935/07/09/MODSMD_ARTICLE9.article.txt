# Applicants at Stanford Are Scarcer Than Jobs
## 
### 
The United States suffers from un
employment, but Stanford suffers from
just the oppositeâ€”an overabundance
iof jobs and rjo one to fill them. This
peculiar .situation is reported by Mrs.
Irene Spenner of the Student Appoint
' ment Service.
The number of positions available
has increased at such a rate that there
are not enough applicants to fill them.
Room jobs, board jobs, and odd jobs
await needy workers and there are no
needy workers to be found.
Mrs. Spenner also reports that she
I has opened a transportation service to
arrange for rides to and from the Uni
! versity at the beginning and end of
each quarter. Those who want ex
pense-sharing passengers, or trans
portation should see Mrs. Spenner and
| make arrangements.
Already listed is transportation for
one person from Granville, Mass., to
Stanford for the autumn quarter.
