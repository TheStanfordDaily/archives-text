# Noted Reader Will Interpret Current Play
## Mrs. Farrington Known Here From Past Readings Of New Plays Touch Wood' To Be Given At Stanford 
### 
Mrs. Guy Stevens Farrington will
bring her rare interpretations of the
current play to the campus with a
reading of C. L. Anthony's "Touch
Wood" at the Little Theater at 8 o'clock
on Friday evening.
Mrs. Farrington is well known in
Stanford dramatic circles. Many recall
with pleasure her several appearances.
She was first introduced to the campus
in 1929 with her distinctive reading of
"Journey's End." General approval
was great enough to justify a second
appearance in 1930 when Dorothy Ban
dan's "The Outsider" was the subject
of her interpretation.
Has Appeared Recently
Mrs. Farrington's most recent appear
ance here was in 1931 when her talent
for characterization prompted a most
excellent portrayal of the famous, now
immortalized by stage and screen,
"Barretts of Wimpole Street." Mrs.
Farrington, a resident of San Fran
cisco, is an instructor of speech at Â»the
University of California. She makes
occasional appearances for various pri
vate organizations and has always been
exceptionally well received. John Hay
Chadwick aptly wrote, after seeing her
performance: "Mrs. Farrington is the
finest dramatic artist I have ever heard.
There is a delicacy, and artistry, an
indescribable finesse about her charac
terizations. That stillness that is only
given to a great artist held for fully a
minute after she had finished."
Comedy Appeal
"Touch Wood," the subject of her
scheduled performance, was produced
By Basil Dean. It has enjoyed marked
success during the recent London sea
son, and is slated for *arly production
on Broadway. "Touch Wood" is con
cerned with the antics of some charac
ters gathered in a little inn on the
Scottish coast and has decided comedy
appeal.
The unique appeal of Mrs. Farring
ton's interpretations lies in the sheer
illusion created. It has been said, by
those who have had the pleasure to
observe her, that one loses all sense of
the prosaic background of a barren
stage. Her characterizations are noted
for their delightful humor and well
timed sense of dramatic climax.
