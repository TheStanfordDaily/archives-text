# CONFERENCE HEARS OREGON PROBLEMS
## 
### 
Oregon's administrative problems
were discussed yesterday morning by
Dr. C. A. Howard, state superintendent
of schools, and Dr. Charles A. Rice,
superintendent of schools, Portland,
Ore.
"What education needs is more men
and women in legislatures who under
stand what education is," Dr. Howard
said in telling of the help educators in
government had given.

He referred to the new reorganization
of higher education in Oregon, which
has attracted wide attention. The new
plan is primarily intended to eliminate
the competition of the various state in-
for legislative favors, a
practice which hindered worth-while
developments.
Dr. Rice discussed the single salary
schedule adopted in Portland which is
based on the training of the teacher
rather than on the grade taught. This
practice encourages the elementary
school teachers to secure a more tho
rough education.
