# Social Effects Of Education Stressed Here
## New Solutions for Problems Of Schools Discussed At Conference Loss of Democratic Control Of Education Feared 
### Benjamin Leese 
Iho social implications of educatioTi
, and their effect on the administrative
field held the attention of prominent
educators speaking before the Confer
ence on Educational Administration
! here this week.
Stressing the problems brought "about
| by the recent social upheavals, Dr.
j Vierling Kersey, California state super
, intendent of public instruction, pointed
j out the new attitudes taken toward
I their solution.
Education Services
j Two approaches have been taken, he
i said. One involves the necessary irn
( mediate relief, and the other seeks to
| supply remedies. Education must be
j concerned with the remedy, or re-
I construction phase. "The attitude that
' government has a co-responsibility
. with individuals makes changes or
| death certain to many present educa
; tional practices," asserted Dr. Kersey,
j He emphasized the fact that the wel
l fare agencies had undertaken many
! services that rightly belonged to edu
( cation. In expressing the fear that un
i less local initiative is aroused demo
cratic control of education would dis
| appear, he pointed to the fact that in
80 per cent of the cases of restored
' services by California schools the fed
j eral government had supplied the
| stimulus.
! Administrative issues and adjusl
, ments needed in elementary, secondary,
j and higher educational institutions
! were discussed Tuesday evening.
Elementary Field
"We must cease to think of the ele-
I mentary field as less important than
I the others," Dr. Paul R. Hanna stated.
I "We must not discriminate between
} salaries for the different levels if we
j are to have competent training for the
j child of 6 as well as for the child of
116." Emphasizing that the elementary
j field requires as much, if not more,
| professional skill than other levels, he
| stated that teachers must be paid
I enough to enable them adequately to
| prepare for the new social-minded edu
| cational process. "Teachers must be fa-
I miliar with a wide range of subjects
! common to our social life," he said.
! He deplored especially the idea that
| the elementary school be used as a
| training ground for secondary teachers
I and principals.
Social Forces
! "Elementary teachers mast be aware
! of the social currents about them and
j help the child reach an understanding
, of social forces," Dr. Hanna concluded.
Carrying the discussion into the sec
| ondary field, Dr. William M. Proctor
I pointed out the present tendency
! toward the formation of a social-cen
tered high school. This requires in
ternal administrative adjustments to
l provide for a curricula formed in the
j light of present social, economic, and
j political problems.
Fusion courses will take the place of
i the present content subjects. "The tend
| cncy of the secondary school to adopt
j the activity type program developed in
I the elementary field is a logical step
J for social centered high schools," Dr.
Proctor said. This will break down the
line between the curricula! - and extra
curricular activities.
Marking System Wrong
Marking systems must be radically |
revised for the new secondary school. J
"Considerable difficulty is being en- j
countered in attempts to abolish mark
ing, due in part to the social prestige
attached to them," stated Dr. Proctor.
Dr. Walter C. Eells, who has been in

Washington for the past year making a
summary of surveys in higher educa- '
tion, presented some of the problems
revealed by such reports.
"Criticism of higher education is one
of the most popular indoor sports of
the American people today," he said,
adding that institutions of higher edu
cation were well aware of their own
problems as evidenced by the great :
number of voluntary studies under- |
taken.
Surveys Effective
Dr. Eells has summarized the con
tents of over 160 surveys, covering over j
40,000 pages of material. He made the
observation that "the college presidency
is one of the hazardous professions to
day, as the average tenure is only five
years."
To prove that such surveys are ef
fective in improving higher education,
he made an independent investigation
which showed that as a result of the
studies 46 per cent of the recommenda
tions contained therein had been car
ried out in full, 26 per cent had been
: carried out in part, a total which defi
nitely justified the work and expense
; involved.
