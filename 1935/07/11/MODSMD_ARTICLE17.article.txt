# Social Effects Of Education Stressed Here
## New Solutions for Problems Of Schools Discussed At Conference Loss of Democratic Control Of Education Feared 
### Benjamin Leese 
Iho social implications of educatioTi
, and their effect on the administrative
field held the attention of prominent
educators speaking before the Confer
ence on Educational Administration
! here this week.
Stressing the problems brought "about
| by the recent social upheavals, Dr.
j Vierling Kersey, California state super
, intendent of public instruction, pointed
j out the new attitudes taken toward
I their solution.
Education Services
j Two approaches have been taken, he
i said. One involves the necessary irn
( mediate relief, and the other seeks to
| supply remedies. Education must be
j concerned with the remedy, or re-
I construction phase. "The attitude that
' government has a co-responsibility
. with individuals makes changes or
| death certain to many present educa
; tional practices," asserted Dr. Kersey,
j He emphasized the fact that the wel
l fare agencies had undertaken many
! services that rightly belonged to edu
( cation. In expressing the fear that un
i less local initiative is aroused demo
cratic control of education would dis
| appear, he pointed to the fact that in
80 per cent of the cases of restored
' services by California schools the fed
j eral government had supplied the
| stimulus.
! Administrative issues and adjusl
, ments needed in elementary, secondary,
j and higher educational institutions
! were discussed Tuesday evening.
Elementary Field
"We must cease to think of the ele-
I mentary field as less important than
I the others," Dr. Paul R. Hanna stated.
I "We must not discriminate between
} salaries for the different levels if we
j are to have competent training for the
j child of 6 as well as for the child of
116." Emphasizing that the elementary
j field requires as much, if not more,
| professional skill than other levels, he
| stated that teachers must be paid
I enough to enable them adequately to
| prepare for the new social-minded edu
| cational process. "Teachers must be fa-
I miliar with a wide range of subjects
! common to our social life," he said.
! He deplored especially the idea that
| the elementary school be used as a
| training ground for secondary teachers
I and principals.
Social Forces
! "Elementary teachers mast be aware
! of the social currents about them and
j help the child reach an understanding
, of social forces," Dr. Hanna concluded.
Carrying the discussion into the sec
| ondary field, Dr. William M. Proctor
I pointed out the present tendency
! toward the formation of a social-cen
tered high school. This requires in
ternal administrative adjustments to
l provide for a curricula formed in the
j light of present social, economic, and
j political problems.
Fusion courses will take the place of
i the present content subjects. "The tend
| cncy of the secondary school to adopt
j the activity type program developed in
I the elementary field is a logical step
J for social centered high schools," Dr.
