# Don't Specialize Too Much
## 
### 
In lliis day of specialization when we are (old that the only
road to success lies in knowing all that there is to know about
soiiK' particular subject, it is refreshing to hear some man who
should know what lie is talking ahout call our attention to the
lad that there is a great danger in over-specialization. In an ad
dress given recently before the American ilvibrary Association
convention in Denver, Oscar <L. Chapman, Assistant Secretary of
Ihe Interior, stressed the danger that lies in the .path of specializa
tion and made a plea lor a wider dissemination of general infor
mation, particularly along economic and political lines.
According to Mr. Chapman, the gap between the educated man
and the man in the street has become very wide, and that gap is
becoming wider, so wide in I act, that it is no longer easy for these
two individuals to meet on common ground. The hope of a democ
racy lies in its leaders being aide to show the rank and file tlicj
direction that it should ta'ke, -and il the leaders and the led can no
longer find common interests and common problems, someone
else is going to take the place of those educated leaders. That
someone else is the demagogue, who finds in the uneducated
masses a ready group of listeners for the panaceas that he has to
oiler. W hen the demagogue has obtained sufficient support for
his plans, he is ready for the next step in bis career, that of becom
ing a dictator.
And then what? The dictator, realizing the necessity of keeping
the masses uninformed, begins to regiment the beliefs and opinions
o-l his people, books are destroyed, and freedom of thought ends.
Mr. Chapman points out that it is one of the duties of the
library to see that the masses receive the information that they
want. II we are to be a free people, we must be an Educated
people, and the library is the best-tilted of any of our institutions
to educate our untrained population in those subjects that are of
most importance to a democracy, political science and economics.
My. all means the library should do Avhat it can to carry out
that educative ideal. T>ut the library alone cannot do it all. The
educated, the trained classes must do their share— they must 'ac
quire enough of that general information that the library should
give to the masses to enable them to furnish the leadership that is
essential to the building-up of a democracy. Specialize by all
means, but don't specialize so much that you lose that vital pos
session which Kipling calls "the common touch."—J.P.M.

dress given recently before the American ilvibrary Association
convention in Denver, Oscar <L. Chapman, Assistant Secretary of
Ihe Interior, stressed the danger that lies in the .path of specializa
tion and made a plea lor a wider dissemination of general infor
mation, particularly along economic and political lines.
According to Mr. Chapman, the gap between the educated man
and the man in the street has become very wide, and that gap is
becoming wider, so wide in I act, that it is no longer easy for these
two individuals to meet on common ground. The hope of a democ
racy lies in its leaders being aide to show the rank and file tlicj
direction that it should ta'ke, -and il the leaders and the led can no
longer find common interests and common problems, someone
else is going to take the place of those educated leaders. That
someone else is the demagogue, who finds in the uneducated
masses a ready group of listeners for the panaceas that he has to
oiler. W hen the demagogue has obtained sufficient support for
his plans, he is ready for the next step in bis career, that of becom
ing a dictator.
And then what? The dictator, realizing the necessity of keeping
the masses uninformed, begins to regiment the beliefs and opinions
o-l his people, books are destroyed, and freedom of thought ends.
Mr. Chapman points out that it is one of the duties of the
library to see that the masses receive the information that they
want. II we are to be a free people, we must be an Educated
people, and the library is the best-tilted of any of our institutions
to educate our untrained population in those subjects that are of
most importance to a democracy, political science and economics.
My. all means the library should do Avhat it can to carry out
that educative ideal. T>ut the library alone cannot do it all. The
educated, the trained classes must do their share— they must 'ac
quire enough of that general information that the library should
give to the masses to enable them to furnish the leadership that is
essential to the building-up of a democracy. Specialize by all
means, but don't specialize so much that you lose that vital pos
session which Kipling calls "the common touch."—J.P.M.
In lliis day of specialization when we are (old that the only
road to success lies in knowing all that there is to know about
soiiK' particular subject, it is refreshing to hear some man who
should know what lie is talking ahout call our attention to the
lad that there is a great danger in over-specialization. In an ad
