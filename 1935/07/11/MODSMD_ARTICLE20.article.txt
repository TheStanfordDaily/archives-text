# The 						Farm in Summer

### 
The Farm 'truly lives up to its name at this time of the year.
Summer quarter finds Stanford campus in its hest attire. Looking
out ol' windows on to Quad we see the palms motionless in the
summer air. As "\ve "walk to class the smell of new-mown hay
comes from the fields, and we know that we are in the country.
If one doubts that Stanford is still the Farm, all he has to do
is lo wandrr pa si the hay fields near the library. There aAvaits a
picture which would recall the past to an old grad : bay being baled
by horse-power. No modern machinery for the barm. Twelve
horses doing the work which one huge machine could do.
It is a novel sighl in tliis modern day to see horses used in
place of machinery, but here on the "Farm" it seems that we live
up to our name. —B.M.
