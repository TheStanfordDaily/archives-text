"THE TAMING OF THE SHREW'
A lusty, rollicking Elizabethan farce,
j one that Falstaff would have loved—
that was Julius Evans' production of
I "The Taming of the Shrew," presented
; Tuesday night in the Greek Theater
] on the University of California campus.
I Evans' production was not an ama
teur one. All the important roles were
j filled by professional actors. Katharina,
j the shrew, was played by Peggy Wood,
I Star of London, Broadway, and Holly
j wood. She did an excellent job of it,
; too, her passions and tantrums being
I furiously convincing. Not even in the
j end was she thoroughly subdued, for
| though she obeyed her lord and master,
I Petruchio, she seemed to do so with
i tongue in cheek, rather than with obe
dient meekness.
Petruchio was played with gusto by
Polio Peters, also well known in tl»e
commercial theater. Peters played his
part as Douglas Fairbanks might have
done had he known more about
Shakespeare than he did, which is to
say that Peters gave Miss Wood as
good as he got, and then some.
Peggy Con-verse, former Stanford
star, took the part of Bianca, sister to
Katherina. All she had to do was play
a fair and docile maid, and this she did
adequately. One fault she has over
come since her Stanford days is a weak
voice. Roughs in the Assembly Hall
balcony often had difficulty in hearing
her, but Tuesday night her voice
reached easily to all parts of the Greek
Theater.
Two other minor parts were played
i by Frederick Stover, former technical
director under Director Harold Helven
ston here at Stanford, and George Leav
ens, '35, who last appeared on the
campus in the spring* quarter produc
tion of "Yellow Jack." Both men were
adequate.
Too much praise cannot be given
Director Julius Evans. The stage busi
ness was most excellent, and the entire
production smooth and well done. The
only detracting elements in the entire
evening were extraneous noises, such
as airplanes and trains, and the bitter
cold in the latter part of the evening.
Nevertheless, these were but small
annoyances considered the excellence
of the production.
The second and last production in
the summer Drama Festival at Cali
fornia is a production of Sean O'Casey's
controversial drama, "Within the
j Gates," in which Peg Converse will
| play opposite Rollo Peters in the lead
roles. "Within the Gates" is scheduled
for Friday night, July 19.

balcony often had difficulty in hearing
her, but Tuesday night her voice
reached easily to all parts of the Greek
Theater.
Two other minor parts were played
i by Frederick Stover, former technical
director under Director Harold Helven
ston here at Stanford, and George Leav
ens, '35, who last appeared on the
campus in the spring* quarter produc
tion of "Yellow Jack." Both men were
adequate.
Too much praise cannot be given
Director Julius Evans. The stage busi
ness was most excellent, and the entire
production smooth and well done. The
only detracting elements in the entire
evening were extraneous noises, such
as airplanes and trains, and the bitter
cold in the latter part of the evening.
Nevertheless, these were but small
annoyances considered the excellence
of the production.
The second and last production in
the summer Drama Festival at Cali
fornia is a production of Sean O'Casey's
controversial drama, "Within the
j Gates," in which Peg Converse will
| play opposite Rollo Peters in the lead
roles. "Within the Gates" is scheduled
for Friday night, July 19.

"THE TAMING OF THE SHREW'
A lusty, rollicking Elizabethan farce,
j one that Falstaff would have loved—
that was Julius Evans' production of
I "The Taming of the Shrew," presented
; Tuesday night in the Greek Theater
] on the University of California campus.
I Evans' production was not an ama
teur one. All the important roles were
j filled by professional actors. Katharina,
j the shrew, was played by Peggy Wood,
I Star of London, Broadway, and Holly
j wood. She did an excellent job of it,
; too, her passions and tantrums being
I furiously convincing. Not even in the
j end was she thoroughly subdued, for
| though she obeyed her lord and master,
I Petruchio, she seemed to do so with
i tongue in cheek, rather than with obe
dient meekness.
Petruchio was played with gusto by
Polio Peters, also well known in tl»e
commercial theater. Peters played his
part as Douglas Fairbanks might have
done had he known more about
Shakespeare than he did, which is to
say that Peters gave Miss Wood as
good as he got, and then some.
Peggy Con-verse, former Stanford
star, took the part of Bianca, sister to
Katherina. All she had to do was play
a fair and docile maid, and this she did
adequately. One fault she has over
come since her Stanford days is a weak
voice. Roughs in the Assembly Hall
balcony often had difficulty in hearing
her, but Tuesday night her voice
reached easily to all parts of the Greek
Theater.
