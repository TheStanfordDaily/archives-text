Summer school students will find in
the new map of the campus an ad
i mirable souvenir of the Farm. The
i map, a product of the Stanford Uni
versity Press, was designed in three
colors by Edward Farmer, assistant
professor in the Graphic Art depart -
1 ment. Selling at a greatly reduced
price this map has many advantages
' over its forerunner. The old map lack
; ed accuracy of detail, and the relatiye
1 positions of the various campus build- !
ings were in error.
The present product was made valid

from aerial photographs and topograph
ic maps of the campus. Turned out by
the new photolith process in true col- i
I ors, this pictorial view of the campus is j
i on sale at the Bookstore.
