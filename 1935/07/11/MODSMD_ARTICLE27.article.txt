# AMERICAN MUSIC IS DISCUSSED BY VISITING MUSICIAN
## New Compositions Not Given Consideration, Says Dr. Prager 
### Elsie Barber 
America is suffering from a mistaken j
idea that all music, to be "good," has j
to be imported and that every mu- j
sician must have an "elli" or a "ski" j
on the end of his name in order to j
succeed, according to Dr. Sigfrid j
Prager, visiting professor of music at j
Stanford this summer. Dr. Prager is i
here from Madison, Wisconsin, where j
lie has been director of civic music ,
since 1931.
"The idea that operas or symphonies j
must be old and established in order to j
secure true appreciation is equally a j
fallacy," said the musician. "Conduc- ,
tors and directors are afraid to offer J
new compositions by unknown com- t
posers, especially Americans, for fear
that they will be failures."
Discusses Future
Dr. Prager painted a glowing picture j
of the American music of the future, j
which he says will be distinctly dif- ;
ferent from this country's music today, j
That of the future will be composed j
and played by the children of today,
those who are now in school, he de- |
clared. Dr. Prager expressed amaze- i
ment at the musical progress and j
knowledge displayed by the children j
of this state in particular and has J
"never seen anything like it."
Civic music is the cornerstone of fine 1
musical building, for it is in the small
communities that its inception and
progress is determined. "Imagine a
map of the country, with dots scat
tered here and there, representing those
communities interested in the arts and j
music," said the doctor. "And then j
imagine this same country a generation \
hence when these rapidly increasing
dots shall have grown closer together
and joined. Such an essentially mu
sical nation as we shall be then!''
Makes Comparisons
Dr. Prager made very apt compari
sons between his adopted country,
America, and that of his birth regard- ,
ing orchestral development and mainte- ,
nance. In Germany, the orchestras are
financially benefited by "being taken to
outlying towns, instead of the people
having to journey to distant points to
hear good music.
"Develop civic music, instead of
handing out money to visiting con
ductors who give so little in return,'
he urged. "Usually, the selections they
do choose to play for the average
American citizen are way over his head
anyway, and that difficulty can be over
come by encouraging native musical <
talent in composing and conducting."
This summer is Dr. Prager's first |
visit to Stanford. "I like you very j
much," he said. "I like the aristocratic i
distinction, the different atmosphere
here at your University. However, the
conditions surrounding your origin, the
reason for which this university was
founded—that of being a monument to
a dearly loved son —would naturally
make you different and distinct from
other colleges."
True Musician
Tall, broad-shouldered, and blue
eyed, Dr. Prager looks and acts the
part of the sincere and true musician.
In addition, his beautiful command of
the English language is amazing, for
he speaks German, Italian, and Span
ish, while also reading French, Latin,
and some Greek.
Born in Berlin, Germany, Dr. Prager
was educated in the European coun
tries, taking his doctor's degree, magna
cum laude, at the University of Halle,
Germany, in philosophy, musicology,
and ancient French. His musical train
ing, which had been begun by his
father, was continued, and at 18 years
of age he directed opera at the Teatro
Fenice in Venice during vacation time.
Until the past few years, Dr. Prager
conducted opera and symphonies ex
clusively.
On the last day of 1924, Dr. Prager

I arrived in New York from South
I America, where he had become an
Argentine citizen. While in that coun
try, he had been appointed, by order
of the mayor of Buenos Aires, a per
manent member of the Municipal
Board for the promotion of national
composition.
In 1925 and 1926, he lectured in Mad
ison, Wisconsin, and in September of
; the latter year he whs invited to take
| charge of and train what was to be
come the polished and perfected Madi
son Civic Symphony Orchestra. It was
while living in that city that Dr. Prager
became an American citizen.
