# AUTHORITY TALKS ON TUDOR MUSIC
## 
### 
Tudor music and its influence on
Shakespeare were discussed lust night
by .Mrs. Claire Baker Holmes in the
third of the series of Tudor lectures
presented each Wednesday evening in
the Women's Clubhouse.
Mrs. Holmes, who received her A.B.
iat Mills, is a recognized authority on
! Tudor music. Her master's thesis, on
| which she spent three years, is entitled,
j "The Influence of Music on Shake-
I speare's Verse." She organized the
' Mills College School for Teachers of
Music and is at present secretary of
j the school.
I Mrs. Holmes made clear the influ-
I ence of the Tudor songs and English
dance music upon the music in Shake
â–  speare's plays and the music of his
J vorse. Her lecture was illustrated with
! vocal and piano renditions of the songs
! of the period.
After the lecture, refreshments were i
served in the lounge room of the club- '
i house, at which time further examples j
;of Tudor music were played on the
! phonograph. These songs were record
ed by the English Singers on the ancient
instruments of that time. Brief scenes
from Shakespeare's comedies were
also read.
At future lectures the education de- !
j partment urges that everyone be pres
ent at 7:30 o'clock, since the disturb- j
i ance caused by late arrivals proves
! most distracting to the lecturer.
