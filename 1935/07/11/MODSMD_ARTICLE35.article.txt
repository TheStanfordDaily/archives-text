# COOVER DISCOVERS NEW NOTE SCRIPT

For at least 2000 years there has been
almost no improvement in the writing
of longhand, while great advances have
been made in all other speech arts.
These are the factors that have urged
Dr. J. S. Coover, professor of psychol
ogy at Stanford, to invent a brief sys
tem of legible writing.
Although numerous methods of sten
ography are available, we still use
longhand. This is because shorthand
methods are hard to learn, and the signs
are so brief that their translation is
difficult. For common use we must
have something that expresses the
phonetic elements in the language.
Dr. Coover has been making labora
tory studies on the comparative legi
bility and facility of reading different
written signs. His note script alphabet
is taken from the letters themselves and
is therefore easy to learn and translate.
In 1897 Nils Strinberg left on the An
dree Ballon expedition for the North
Pole. In 1930 the remains of this un
successful expedition were found. A
remarkable discovery was the note book
of Nils Strinberg in which he had
written a diary of the excursion. These
notes were in the Arend's system of
shorthand to be communicated by car
rier pigeon to a newspaper in Norway.
Thirty-three years after the writing of
these notes they were easily trans
lilted.
The basic method of these notes was
Gabelsberger from German script.
