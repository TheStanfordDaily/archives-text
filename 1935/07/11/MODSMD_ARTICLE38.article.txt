"To the younger generation Mrs.
Stanford is usually thought of only as
one of the founders of Stanford. To
the older generation she was a definite
personality â€” the wife of a railroad
builder, former governor of California,
and United States senator." Thus states
the Stanford University Press in an
nouncing "The Biography of Mrs. Jane
L. Stanford," an intimate account by
Bertha Berner.
The author served as Mrs. Stanford's
private secretary and companion from
1884 until the death of the latter in
1904. Because of her intimate relation
with Mrs. Stanford, the author is in a
position to relate many little known
incidents about the life of the family.
Containing descriptions of the exten
sive travels of the Stanfords and va
rious anecdotes hitherto unpublished,
the book will be placed on sale on
August 1.
This authentic, interesting biography
contains five illustrations showing Mrs.
Stanford during various periods of her
life. In the appendix is found an in
teresting sketch of the old Palo Alto
Farm, with a list of the racing horses
owned by Mr. Stanford. Also a brief
review of the Art Gallery and its orig
inal contents is included.
The book will be released soon and
will go on sale at the Stanford Book
store.
