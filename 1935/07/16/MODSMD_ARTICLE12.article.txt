# Hoover Tells Educators Need for Individuality
## 
### 
"Yours is the great job of developing 1
individuality," former President Hoo
ver told the conference of administra- |
tors at the closing dinner Saturday I
evening. In a very short address he j
pointed out the importance of the ad- I
ministrators in upholding American
ideals of liberty.
"You have; indurated the American
peoples with the ideal of individual lib- j
erty. Our problem is to make this fit f
into the era of bigness." At the same j
time he pointed out the need to develop '
co-operation and toleration if we would j
maintain a unified nation.
Chester H. Rowell, editor of the San
Francisco Chronicle, presented an anal
ysis of the present situation that is
disturbing all of Europe.
"One week's time may determine
whether or not a petty raid on Ethiopia
shall set all Europe on fire," he said.
"History denies that we can keep out of |
war just by a policy of isolation. The ,
question of the freedom of the seas j
which we failed to settle in 1812 might
easily be the means of involving us in i
the next war."
"It is the solemn duty of the United i
States to preserve on earth one oasis |
of ixvice," Mr. Rowell concluded, after j
stating the task of education in the great
problems of maintaining the permanent \
| truths and the survival of peace.
Dean Grayson N. Kefauver brought :
the conference to a close in an address j
i of appreciation to those who had par- J
J ticipated.
"The Conference represented a higher j
type of personnel than any held here
in recent years," Dean Kefauver
j stated, speaking of the Educational Ad- j
ministration Conference yesterday.
Approximately G4O persons attended
! the meeting, representing over 16 states.
I These conferences are annual affairs,
1 being held during the summer quarter
in order that educators from the field
! may take part.
