# Jolly-Up Tonight in Union First Dance of Quarter
## 
### 
A jolly-up tonight will be the first
social event of the summer quarter. It
will be held from 7 to 8 o'clock in the
Women's Clubhouse. The dance is
sponsored by the Union living group,
including Mariposa and Madrona.
Jim Triolo will act as host of the
occasion and he should impart the tra
ditional air of a Stanford jolly-up.
Bridge tables will lie set up in the
lounge room for those who can not be
moved by Jim's personality to dance.
The response to this affair will deter
mine whether or not social events will
be planned.
On the dance committee are: Polly
Moore, chairman, Frances Ford, Doro
thy Snodgrass, Margot Brownrigg. and
I Phyllis Sawyer.
