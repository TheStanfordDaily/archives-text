# Odds 99 To 1 You'd Repeat
## Terman, Butenweiser Study Marital Happiness Of 300 Couples 
### 
If you arc a happily married man
or woman the chances are 99 to 1 that
I you would marry the same man or
woman if you had it to do over again, j
according to Dr. Lewis M. Terman and j
Dr. Paul Butenweiser of the Stanford |
faculty.
This conclusion is given in the cur- j
rent issue of the Journal of Social
Psychology in an article entitled "Per- 1
sonality Factors in Marital Compata- j
bility."
Questionnaire Method Used
Drs. Terman and Butenweiser, head ,
and technical assistant of the psychol- i
ogy department here, put the marital j
relationships of 300 Santa Clara Val- i
! ley couples under examination by '
means of questionnaires. These couples
were of happily married, less happily
married, and divorced groups.
Age at the time of marriage and the
I number of children are not important
factors in marital happiness, according
to these findings.
Among the questions asked was, |
"Would you marry the same person?"
Ninety-nine of the husbands in the !
happy group declared they would, !
i while one would not marry at all. Of '
the wives, 99 said they would, but one j
would marry a different man.
Of the less happy husbands and '
wives, 57 in each group said they would |
marry the same person, while 27 hus
bands and 26 wives would marry some-
I one else, and 15 husbands and 13 wives
i said they would not marry at all.
89 Never Regret Marriage
When asked if they ever regretted
marriage, husbands in the happy group
| answered: frequently, none; occa
; sionally, 1; rarely 10; and never, 89.
I Wives in this group: frequently, none;
i occasionally, 1; rarely, 8; and never, 91.
Husbands in the less happy group:
frequently, 10; occasionally, 31; rarely,
] 39; and never, 19. Wives in this group:
frequently, 7; occasionally, 33; rarely,
i 39; and never, 19.
Concerning the matter of settling do
mestic arguments, 92 husbands and 87
I wives reported adjudicating rows by
"mutual give and take." In the less |
happy groups, 66 husbands and 74 |
i wives gave the same answer.
Principal reasons for the domestic
I disputes were demonstrations of af
' l'cction, friends, intimate relations, in
; eluding mothers-in-law, table man
â–  ners, and finances.
Seven per cent of the couples were
j unhappy because they could not agree
|on how to spend their leisure, while
i philosophy of life, care of the children,
j and religion were strong factors.
