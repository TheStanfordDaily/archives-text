# Goldenweiser Urges Change In Education
## Sociologist Advocates Move For More Flexible Instruction Would Penalize Incompetent Instructors 
### Robert Starkweather 
"The educational system of the
American college suffers from a lack
of plasticity and an excess of mech
anism," said Dr. Alexander Golden
weiser, visiting professor of sociology,
in an interview today.
The noted sociologist and anthro
pologist criticized the educational sys
tem on the ground of its rigidity which
is inimical to the development of in
dividual personality in the students.
Individual Needs
"I would legally penalize the profes
sor that displays incompetence in his
position as a lecturer," continued Dr.
Goldenweiser, with a wink. He con
siders it a waste of time and effort for
a man proficient in research, but ineffi
cient in lecturing, to be compelled to
lecture.
As a remedy Dr. Goldenweiser sug
gests a plan whereby compulsory at
tendance at lectures is carried up to
the junior year. From this point on he
advocates a reliance upon individual
initiative and a tutorial system of in
dependent study. He feels that the
system must meet the individual needs
of the student.
Progressive Society
In discussing our social system lie
said, "We are not a progressive society,
bui we aspire to be one." He defines a
progressive society as "One which is
wise or discerning enough to see its own
faults, has courage enough to admit
them, is technically prepared to remedy
them, and is possessing of a public
opinion favorable to the application of
! these mechanisms.
| "We can become a progressive so
| ciety," he continued, "by instruction
| of the citizen in those functions which
make possible such a society." Knowl
j edge, liberation from dogma, inde
pendent judgment, the use of experi
j mental techniques in social control, and
i a collective public opinion based on the
idea that society is dynamic, are the
principal.functions he mentioned.
Revolutionary Changes
"What we need is revolutionary
changes brought about by intelligently
! directed evolution," he concluded, "un
! less we care to be confronted by evolu
| tion through revolution of a forceful
nature. The latter has been the method
used by Russia and other European na
| Hons." He finds in this method no
I provision for future social change,
: which only the progressive spirit of a
1 free democracy can inculcate.
Dr. Goldenweiser was formerly
1 teaching anthropology at Columbia
University, New York. Since 1930 he
I has held the position of Professor of
Thought and Culture at the Portland
i Extension of the University of Oregon.
; For the last two years he has also
served as visiting professor of sociology
at Reed College in Portland. He is the
! author of a number of anthropological
works, among which arc "Early Civi
; lization and "Robots or Gods."
