Works of the masters will again be
presented at the phonograph recitals in
Room 84 at Stanford University today
and tomorrow at 4:15 o'clock.
A rendition of the Introduction and
Dancc from de Falla's "La Vida Breve"
is a welcome addition to the domestic
catalogues. It is full of Spanish sun
shine and rhythmic gaiety. The Bourne
mouth Municipal Orchestra, conducted
by Sir Dan Godfrey, plays the spirited
Henry VIII dances (Edward German).
By far the finest recording yet made
of "A Night on Bare Mountain" of
Moussorgsky, is presented by the
Colonne Symphony Orchestra of Paris,
under Paul Paray. Sir Henry Wood
and the London Symphony Orchestra
tfive us another recording of Schubert's
Unfinished Symphony.
Three sets of discs formerly issued
are available this month in two-record
Albums. Grieg's Symphonic Dances
Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 (Op.(> 4), played by Issai
Dobrowen and symphony orchestra is
beautifully reproduced. Cesar Franck's
celestial "Redemption," played by the
orchestra of the Concert Poulet, is rare
musical experience. Two outstanding
discs of 1934 were made by Sir Ham
ilton Harty and the London Philhar
monic Orchestra, of Handel's ever pop
ular "Water Music."
The Paris Opera, with competent so
loists and the chorus under the baton
of Phillippe Gaubert, are responsible
for a well recorded disc covering twe
dramatic spots in Gounod s Faust
the Prison Scene and the death of Val
entine.
