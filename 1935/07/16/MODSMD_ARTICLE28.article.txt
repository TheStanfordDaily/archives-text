There has always been something
cosmopolitan about San Francisco with
its well-marked colonies.
San Francisco's Chinatown, with
Grant Avenue as its main artery, is the
largest settlement of Chinese outside of
China.
The jewelry shops displaying gold
filagree and jade, with their work
benches in the windows in full view
of passersby, are especially interesting.
Sidewalk Workers
The meat and fish stalls, the quaint
apothecaries, the cobblers who work on
the sidewalks, the lily and the bird
vendors, the telephone exchange where
Chinese girls operate the switchboard,
the headquarters of the Six Companies,
and the Joss House are places which no
visitor to the bay region should miss.
"Perfect Blonde"
According to the San Francisco
Chamber of Commerce, perhaps the
most perfect blonde of the world may
be seen in the American-born Chinese
girl.
At the foot of Grant Avenue, China
town merges into the Latin quarter
with its Italian and French restaurants.
Here also are the Spanish and Mexican
districts where cheese, breads, pastes,
and bologna are served, in. the only res
taurants of their kind this side of the
Mediterranean.

cinity of Third and Folsom Streets you
