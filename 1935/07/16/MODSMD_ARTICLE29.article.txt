# The 						CRITIC
## THE 						SCOUNDREL 
### 
A few months ago, in Manhattan,
The Radio City Music Hall played host
to that most amazing picture, "The
Scoundrel;" In it, displayed rather in
conspicuously and thoroughly un-
Hollywood, were such well-knowns of
the New York theater as Noel Coward,
who as you recall is responsible for
such momentous works as "Cavalcade,"
"Design for Living," and "Private
Lives," also Hope Williams, of "Strike
Me Pink" fame, and Julie Hayton and
Martha Sleeper, relative newcomers to
the footlights, as well as that conspic
uous figure in Times Square doings—
the inimitable Alexander Woolcott.
The producers were that incredibly ver
satile pair of rascals, Ben Hecht and
Charles Mfc Arthur. who earned Broad
way's respect many seasons ago with
"The Front Page" and startled the
world of the cinema with such unique
productions as "The Man Who Re
claimed His Head" and "Crime With
out Passion."
"The Scoundrel" is one of those fan
tastic, unbelievable stories that, de
spite its metaphysical character, pro
vokes much comment among even the
most stable of us. At times this bundle
of urbane sophistication embarrasses
one with its strangely inconsistent sen
timentality. Originally intended as u
vehicle for pseudo-sophistication and
edification of the would-be sophisti
cates, I think the attempt must have
turned around and even surprised Mr.
Coward with its sheer cleverness and at
times brilliance.
