# DR. JEAN-MARIE CARRE PUBLISHES MANY VOLUMES DURING HIS EXTENSIVE TRAVELS
## 
### 
Publishing a book a year would be
quite exhaustive to many authors, but
to Dr. Jean-Marie Carre, acting profes
sor of Romanic languages visiting here
irom the University of Lyons, France,
it is r.ViiVmg out of the ordinary. From
1920 to the present time, Dr. Carre has
written and published 15 volumes, as
( well as carrying on in his several
professorial posts.
Dr. and Mrs. Carre will be honored
at a banquet given by Pi Delta Phi,
national honorary French fraternity, in
the Union Alcove on Thursday night.
Dr. Carre believes that the Europ
ean schools and colleges are much
more thorough and intensive than
American ones. Teaching for him over
there is more in detail, since he offers
more of a bibliography to his students
than he does here.
It is impossible to foresee what will
happen in the future regarding the
tense European situation, he says. No
one can read the minds of Hitler and
Mussolini; hence, no one can correctly,
prophesy the happenings of the next
few months. The people do not want
war, but they live in constant dread of
it. Dr. Carre's home in Ardenne in the
northern part of France was ransacked
and pillaged during the World War and
his entire library of 3,000 volumes con
fiscated.
His own works have been on a va
riety of subjects, many of which have
been translated into English. Beginning
in 1920 with "Histoire d'une Division
de Couverture," which traced' the au
thor's own experiences during the war,
Dr. Carre continued in the same year
with "Goethe in England," thus delv

' ing into comparative literature in Eu
rope.
Dr. Carre has written more books
on the subject of comparative literature
than on any other, especially during
the past few years. However, in the
interim between his earlier works and
his most recent, he found time to write
several biographies, chief among which
are "Life of Rimbaud" (A Season in
Hell), "Life of Goethe," and "Life of
Robert Louis Stevenson" (A Frail
Warrior).
In *1933, Dr. Carre was awarded the
Grand' Prix Gobert by the French
Academy for his finest work to date,
"French Travelers and French Writers
in Egypt." This publication, in two
volumes, required exhaustive and in
tensive study and research into the
French influence in that country. Dr.
Carre was head of the French Depart
ment at the Royal University of Cairo
from 1929 to 1933.
This summer at Stanford is not Dr.
Ciirre's first visit to Stanford, since he
was acting professor of Romanic Lan
guages here in the summer of 1920.
Since that time, however, he has taught
elsewhere in the United States and has
traveled' extensively throughout Asia
and Africa. He has told of these expe
riences and travels in his book. "Prom
enades dans Trois Continents," pub
lished in 1933.
Although they are enjoying Amer
ica, Dr. and Mrs. Carre are looking
forward,"to being with their three chil
dren again in their native country. The
children could not accompany their
parents due to conflicting school sched
ules.

This summer at Stanford is not Dr.
Ciirre's first visit to Stanford, since he
was acting professor of Romanic Lan
guages here in the summer of 1920.
Since that time, however, he has taught
elsewhere in the United States and has
traveled' extensively throughout Asia
and Africa. He has told of these expe
riences and travels in his book. "Prom
enades dans Trois Continents," pub

Although they are enjoying Amer
ica, Dr. and Mrs. Carre are looking
forward,"to being with their three chil

children could not accompany their
parents due to conflicting school sched

Publishing a book a year would be
quite exhaustive to many authors, but
to Dr. Jean-Marie Carre, acting profes
sor of Romanic languages visiting here
irom the University of Lyons, France,
it is r.ViiVmg out of the ordinary. From
1920 to the present time, Dr. Carre has
written and published 15 volumes, as
( well as carrying on in his several
professorial posts.
Dr. and Mrs. Carre will be honored
at a banquet given by Pi Delta Phi,
national honorary French fraternity, in
the Union Alcove on Thursday night.
Dr. Carre believes that the Europ
ean schools and colleges are much
more thorough and intensive than
American ones. Teaching for him over
there is more in detail, since he offers
more of a bibliography to his students
than he does here.
It is impossible to foresee what will
happen in the future regarding the
tense European situation, he says. No
one can read the minds of Hitler and
Mussolini; hence, no one can correctly,
prophesy the happenings of the next
few months. The people do not want
war, but they live in constant dread of
it. Dr. Carre's home in Ardenne in the
northern part of France was ransacked
and pillaged during the World War and
his entire library of 3,000 volumes con
fiscated.
His own works have been on a va
riety of subjects, many of which have
been translated into English. Beginning
in 1920 with "Histoire d'une Division
de Couverture," which traced' the au
thor's own experiences during the war,
Dr. Carre continued in the same year
with "Goethe in England," thus delv

' ing into comparative literature in Eu
rope.
Dr. Carre has written more books
on the subject of comparative literature
than on any other, especially during
the past few years. However, in the
interim between his earlier works and
his most recent, he found time to write
several biographies, chief among which
are "Life of Rimbaud" (A Season in
Hell), "Life of Goethe," and "Life of
Robert Louis Stevenson" (A Frail
Warrior).
In *1933, Dr. Carre was awarded the
Grand' Prix Gobert by the French
Academy for his finest work to date,
"French Travelers and French Writers
in Egypt." This publication, in two
volumes, required exhaustive and in
tensive study and research into the
French influence in that country. Dr.
