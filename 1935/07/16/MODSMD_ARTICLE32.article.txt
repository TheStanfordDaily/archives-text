# Oldfather To Talk Thursday About Ancient Documents
## 
### 
"The Extra-canonical Sayings of
Jesus" will be the subject of a lecture
by Professor W. A. Oldfather, acting
professor of Classical Literature, Thurs
day evening at 8 o'clock in the Little
Theater.
The discovery on papyrus fragments
in Egypt during the last 40 years of a
few dozen reputed Logio (or sayings)
of Jesus is beginning to turn attention
to this hitherto much neglected source
of information, according to Professor
Oldfather.
All told, there are several hundred
words and a few anecdotes preserved
in ancient documents outside the New
Testament ascribed to Jesus, Professor
Oldfather said. Only a small fraction
of these can be genuine, but some of
this latter group are of quite extraor
dinary interest and importance, he
added. #
Dr. Oldfather will* review briefly the
present status of critical research in this
field and then will give samples of the
most noteworthy of the authentic say
ings, with an occasional word of exten
uation.
Dr. Oldfather, who is chairman of the
Department of Classics at the Univer
sity of Illinois, came to the Coast a year
ago last spring and delivered the Sather
Lectures at the University of California,
lie spoke at Stanford on "Levels of
Culture."
