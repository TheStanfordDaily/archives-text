# 'Wild West' Will Come To Life At World Famed Salinas Rodeo
## 
### 
For fours days starting Thursday, t
Salinas will again be the scene of a
I colorful, world famed jodeo. Wild
horses ind steers that are really wild
will be ridden by some of the most
skillful and daring riders of the West.
There will be aontests in which stock
horses only half broken and fresh from
the range will be ridden as they are on
the range. The atmosphere in Salinas
during, these four days will be per
meated with the spirit of the Old West.
The squeak of saddle leather mingled
with the jingle of curb chains and spur
rowels will be heard over the pounding
j of hoofs and the yelling of the riders, j

The colorfully dressed cowboys will !
be seen through clouds of genuine
western dust as they ride untamed
beasts or fly through the air and fall
to the ground with sounds also charac
teristically western.
An interesting feature of the show
this year will be the California Outdoor I
High School Girl Contest in which 41
entrants from as many countries have
been entered. The winner of this con
test will be given a free trip to Hawaii, j
A little more than an hour's drive
from here, the Salinas Rodeo is one of j
the few vestages of early California
life.
