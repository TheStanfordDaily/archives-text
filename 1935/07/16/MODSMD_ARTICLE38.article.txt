# PROFESSOR LUTZ ADMITS EUROPEAN SITUATION GRAVE
## Nations Once More Dividing Into Two Hostile Camps 
### 
"Europe is no longer interested in
who started the last war, it is now
wondering who is going to start the
next one," Dr. Ralph Haswell Lutz told
the audience which filled the Little
Theater Thursday night. In speaking
of the European Crisis of 1935, Profes
sor Lutz said, "One possible solution of
this problem is a Central European se
curity and non-intervention pact signed
by all European powers."
Dr. Lutz told how, in spite of the
success of Fascism, Italy was in a pre
carious position economically, socially,
and politically. "It is difficult to tell
what is going on in Italy because of the
strict censorship of the press and the
governmental control of international
news agencies in that country," he ex
plained.
Professor Lutz believes the only way
out for Italy is through the exploitation
of some smaller European nation be
cause it is impossible for her to indus
trialize much further than she has al
ready.
Other Danger Spots
Austria, Dr. Lutz said, is one of the
greatest danger spots of Europe today,
and Yugoslavia is another menace to
world peace.
The audience listened attentively
when he told them he had underesti
mated the depth and breadth of the
revolution in Germany and the states
manship of the Hitler. "The revolution
has completely changed German life.
Hitler has done two things for hfs
country: he has unified it as never be
fore and has given the people a new and
distinct hope."
He told also of the amazing en
thusiasm of young Germans and how
Hitler has turned the national attitude
from despair to hope and has raised the
moral standards. "Germany is oi'gan
ized from youth to old age. Infants are
taught to say 'Heil Hitler' at 14 months
of age."
The Position of France
"France is still the greatest economic
and military power on the European
Continent," said Dr. Lutz. "A great
majority of the strong countries of Eu
rope are the allies of France."
According to him, France could cross
the Rhine and send into Cfermany the
largest army in Europe and has fortifi
cations on the Rhine which would be
capable of repulsing any other Europ
ean force.
He concluded by saying, "The situa
tion as I see it is extremely serious.
The League of Nations seems to be in
eclipse and Italy is about to invade
Abyssinia. In five years Germany will
be as strong as France and will have
many more friends. Europe is grad
ually dividing into two hostile coali
tions."

The Position of France
"France is still the greatest economic
and military power on the European
Continent," said Dr. Lutz. "A great
majority of the strong countries of Eu
rope are the allies of France."
According to him, France could cross
the Rhine and send into Cfermany the
largest army in Europe and has fortifi
cations on the Rhine which would be
capable of repulsing any other Europ
ean force.
He concluded by saying, "The situa
tion as I see it is extremely serious.
The League of Nations seems to be in
eclipse and Italy is about to invade
Abyssinia. In five years Germany will
be as strong as France and will have
many more friends. Europe is grad
ually dividing into two hostile coali
tions."
"Europe is no longer interested in
who started the last war, it is now
wondering who is going to start the
next one," Dr. Ralph Haswell Lutz told
the audience which filled the Little
Theater Thursday night. In speaking
of the European Crisis of 1935, Profes
sor Lutz said, "One possible solution of
this problem is a Central European se
curity and non-intervention pact signed
by all European powers."
Dr. Lutz told how, in spite of the
success of Fascism, Italy was in a pre
carious position economically, socially,
and politically. "It is difficult to tell
what is going on in Italy because of the
strict censorship of the press and the
governmental control of international
news agencies in that country," he ex
plained.
Professor Lutz believes the only way
out for Italy is through the exploitation
of some smaller European nation be
cause it is impossible for her to indus
trialize much further than she has al
ready.
Other Danger Spots
Austria, Dr. Lutz said, is one of the
greatest danger spots of Europe today,
and Yugoslavia is another menace to
world peace.
The audience listened attentively
when he told them he had underesti
mated the depth and breadth of the
revolution in Germany and the states
manship of the Hitler. "The revolution
has completely changed German life.
Hitler has done two things for hfs
country: he has unified it as never be
fore and has given the people a new and
distinct hope."
He told also of the amazing en
thusiasm of young Germans and how
Hitler has turned the national attitude
from despair to hope and has raised the
moral standards. "Germany is oi'gan
ized from youth to old age. Infants are
taught to say 'Heil Hitler' at 14 months
of age."
