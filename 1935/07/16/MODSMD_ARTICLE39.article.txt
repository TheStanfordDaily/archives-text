# Creative Writing Plays Part in Educative Field
## 
### 
Creative writing is playing an in
creasingly important part in education,
Professor Holland D. Roberts, associate
professor of education, told a radio au
dience last night on the Stanford Radio
Hour.
"Everyone has latent talent to do
original work," Professor Roberts said.
"It is quite true that the life of every
person would make at least one book.
In the past it has been said that a poet
died young in every man. Today it is
the role of education to find ways to
encourage the poet and the artist in
every man to live, to grow, and to
create â€”if not in writing then in music
and the arts, in industry, business, or
the sciences."
Education, the professor pointed out,
was formerly concerned with suppress
ing individual talent. Children were
taught to write in stilted phrases and
to express other men's thoughts. To
day educators seek to develop the cre
ative ability of the child and enable
him to think for himself.
Professor Roberts gave quotations
from student writers of the "Lit," Palo
Alto High School publication. Creative
talent, he explained, is fostered in these
students by discussion groups and fac
ulty advisers rather than by class
room teaching.
"These unknown talents are all about
us, in those we meet in our daily
round," he said in closing. "To find and
develop them in creative writing, as in
other fields, is the new quest in edu
cation."
