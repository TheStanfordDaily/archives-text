# Hot Days Bring Beer To Class
## Professor Proves His Point And Students Suffer In Silence

Boer on the historically dry Stan- j
ford campus! But not to soothe the |
parchcd throats of students; for the |
amber liquid was merely the subject of I
an experiment demonstrated last week j
by Professor Francis W. Bergstrom to j
a class in organic chemistry.
Using a simple distillation process, j
Professor Bergstrom determined the j
alcoholic content of a popular brand
of beer.
Two hundred cubic centimeters of
beer were mixed with an equal amount
of water, defoamed, and placed in a
large flask. Heat was applied, and as j
the vapor passed off, it was condensed
and placed in a graduated flask. By 1
means of a specific gravity test it was '
shown that the beer contained 4 per |
cent alcohol by volume.
And then, while the class digested
this weighty deduction, he slowly j
poured the beer down the sink. v j
