# Moon Throws Library Students into Uproar
## 
### 
The reading room in the library was
filled last night with students, hard al
work and totally oblivious of the fact
that outside an eclipse of the moon was ;
taking place. A student, acutely aware !
of the phenomena, was pained that his
fellows were missing the event, so he j
stepped into the reading room and, like !
a train announcer, yelled, "All out for
the eclipse." The dignified silence of j
the room was completely broken as the â– 
enterprising students rose in a body,
left their books, and went outside to j
see the eclipse.
According to Professor Sidney D. ,
Town ley, professor of astronomy, emer
-1 itus, lunar eclipses are quite common,
! occurring nearly every year. The spec
! tacle is not considered by astronomers
to be as scientifically important as solar
eclipses, however.
Starting a few minutes after 7, and
; reaching its climax shortly after 8
1 o'clock, the shadow of the earth passed
! slowly across the face of the moon to
j finally blot it out completely. This
eclipse was predicted to the minute
by the astronomers of the U.S. Naval
Observatory and published in the As
| tronomical Almanac two years ago.
