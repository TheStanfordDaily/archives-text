# "Dark Tower" Supported By Excellent Cast
## Three Leads Taken by People Experienced in Acting And Directing Clever Dialogue and Suspense Characterize Play 
### 
A rather unusual and fine cast will
present the reading of Alexander
Woolcott's successful play, "The Dark
Tower," to be given at 8 o'clock to
morrow night in the Little Theater by
Sword and Sandals.
Bill Kilby and Bill Pabst, both of
whom have leading parts, have gained
prominence in radio. Pabst, a Stanford
graduate, took the lead in Galsworthy's
"Escapade," given at the Community
theater where Kilby directed the two
plays, "Skip" and "Olympia."
Catherine Elwood, who has the other
leading part in "The Dark Tower," is
an old Stanford star and played leads
in the campus performances, "Broad
way," "Pygmalion," and "Berkeley
Square."
Chance for Interpretation
Alexander Woolcott, whom everyone
knows through his prolific writings and
his radio work, collaborated with
George Kaufman in writing "The
Dark Tower," and together they have
produced a work which will give the
experienced Cc.st of tomorrow night's
reading a chance for some real inter
pretation. It contains some very bril
liant dialogue and has enough suspense
to warrant its being called a good mys
tery drama.
Some controversy has been raised
over the question of censorship of cer
tain parts of "The Dark Tower," it be
ing intended for the audiences of New
York City.
Campus People in Cast
The members of the supporting cast
were all prominent on the campus last
year. Annelies Morgan, Mary Ann
Craty, and Harriet Hall Kilby have
taken leads in plays. Delbert Jeffers,
Hugh Baker, George Alexander, Betty
Reynolds, and Tom Sellers have been
in previous readings.
