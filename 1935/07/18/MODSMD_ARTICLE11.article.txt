# Mystery Clouds Origin of Lady Made of Stone
## 
### 
Where did the 600-pound lady under
i the Kappa Sig porch come from? Her
| brief interlude of fame seems about to
be renewed. After she was discovered
hiding under the porch at the Kappa
Sigma house her picture appeared in
j the San Francisco and Palo Alto papers
and then she was forgotten.
Recently, however, a San Francisco
, columnist claimed that he had solved
! the mystery surrounding the stone
j lady's origin. He asserts that she was
taken from the old Stanford place by
i another fraternity and placed in a
j swimming pool on the campus, and
j that the Kappa Sigs rescued her and
took her home under the porch.
The Daily finds on good authority,
however, that its original story was cor
i rect but incomplete. The men who, on
.that alcoholic night long ago, brought
j the statue home, also put her in the
top bed of a double-decker at the house.
She survived the fall to the floor and
made her way down under the porch,
; there to stay for many years.
As to the original resting place of
this adventurous stone lady the mystery
I still remains. She won't talk.
