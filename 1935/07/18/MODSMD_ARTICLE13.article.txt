# Lyric Poetry Is Subject Of Fourth Tudor Lecture
## 
### 
"The field of lyric poetry in the six
i tcenth century, as it existed before
I Sydney and Spencer, was generally
neglected and misunderstood," said
A. Yvor Winters, English instructor, in
| the Tudor lecture last night.
Having for his subject, "Lyric Poetry
| in the Sixteenth Century," Mr. Winters
i discussed the profound and almost
| realistic types of lyrics which reached
| their highest point in the works of
George Gascoigne.
The Petrarchan movement, made
manifest in the 'eighties of the sixteenth
1 century, introduced a graceful and
'elaborate type of rhetoric, of which the
| first great, masters were Sydney and
Spencer. Mr. Winters went on to say
that several of the sixteenth century
writers lasted over into the beginning
i of the following century, among them
being Ben Johnson and Shakespeare.
Mr. Winters' lecture was one of the
series presented every Wednesday night
i in connection with the Shakespearean
i courses being given at Stanford this
I summer.
