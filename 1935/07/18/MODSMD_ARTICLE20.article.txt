# Impending War
## 
### 
J)r. Lutz, speaking last week on the European crisis, said that
another war on the Continent seemed inevitable. To the greater
part of the audience this was an interesting matter in much the
same manner as the houts for the heavyweight title are interesting.
The average American cannot see that he is any more involved in a
European conflict than he is in the liaer-Hraddoek light. The re
action of many students was simply that it was too had that Europe
had to gel into these messes.
This same attitude was prevalent before the last war. Yet the
inevitable propaganda, sabotage, and array of diplomatic incidents
spirt up the country until American sentiment heartily backed our
entrance in the conflict.
Today all this has been exposed and the futility of war has been
made very evident to the American public. Organizations till over
the country have gone on record against our participation in an
other war. Polls of college students revealed that the sentiments of
the younger generation were against the entrance of the United
Stales into a foreign conflict.
When and if this new war breaks out in Europe will this feeling
survive the campaigns of the belligerents to draw us in? Will the
American college students, the leaders of tomorrow, be able to
maintain their present attitude toward war? It is ;i mailer which,
if Dr. 'Lulz's prediction is borne out,*mav soon be put to test.—
