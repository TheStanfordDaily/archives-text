# Swimming Privileges
## 
### 
Why is if that Stanford men and women are obliged to leave
Hie campus to swim together when we have four excellent pools
on Ihe campus? The only mixed swimming permitted is from
lo f» o'clock on Sunday at the women's pool. Swimming, however,
is a spontaneous sport to he enjoyed any hot afternoon. Certainly
some arrangements can he made to permit invited men guests to
use the women's pool for two hours every afternoon. We have the
facilities for making Stanford a most attractive summer univer
sity. Let's use them.—lJ. F.
