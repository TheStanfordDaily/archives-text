# Jolly-Up
## 
### 
The success of the t'nion jolly-up on Tuesday evening can not
be overestimated. 11 the success of this undertaking was to be the
prerequisite for more campus social activities, there should be little
doubt that there will be more jolly-lips on the Stanford campus
this summer.
We of the Stanford Daily thank the Union girls for their co
operation on this matter of social activities, and it is our hope that
more siicli occasions will be forthcoming soon.â€”V. 11.
