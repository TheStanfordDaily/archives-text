"THREE MEN ON A HORSE"
! At the Geary Theater, S.F.
This is a light, amusing, unpreten-
I tious comedy that manages to supply
j quite a few effortless laughs in an eve
ning. And these laughs'come from sit
uation and acting, not gags, there be
ing only two actual gags in the whole
show.
"Thi •ee Men on a Horse" is the story
of a meek little man, a verse writer for
greeting cards, who has an uncanny
knack of picking the winning horses.
But he never bets, for that would de
sti'oy the fun in it. He falls in with
three race track touts, who shoot the
I works on his selections, giving him ,10
! per cent of their winnings.
All this is added to by the fact that
his wife does not know where he is and
is simply frantic with worry. There's
a happy ending, of course, after the
three bettors have killed their golden
egg goose by forcing him to bet, which
destroys his powers.
Not much on plot, no, but Percy Kil -
bride as Erwin Trowbridge, the mild
little poet, manages to make the char
acter excruciatingly funny,- while Shel
don Leonard as Patsy, the leader of the
betting gang, makes an excellent foil.
Not worth the $2.75 fo*£'. an evening
performance, but a balcony seat at a
matinee would be a pleasant way to
kill an afternoon. —Bernheim.
