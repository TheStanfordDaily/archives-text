# CAMPUS GETS THE BIRD Not the Bronx Cheer MERELY BARN SWALLOWS
## 
### 
Stanford gets the bird (or rather the
birds) and likes it. The bird is not of
the Bronx-cheer variety but, instead,
consists of a large colony of barn swal
lows that make the campus their offi
cial headquarters during the breeding
season.
Every March thousands of these birds
fill the air with hurried activity. The
eaves of the roof on the Quad furnish
an especially desirable location for the
construction of their countless mud
nests.
According to Edgar Schroder, of the
Building Superintendent's office, the
nests are not disturbed or molested,
since certain bird lovers on the cam
pus have requested that the swallows
be allowed to nest here during their
breeding season.
Mr. Schroder said that the mud used
by these birds in nest-building comes
from the shores of Lagunita Lake. It
has often been found that the nests con
tain bits of horse-hair and straw, added
to give them greater strength.
Strangely, the nests crumble and fall
to the ground after they have been
vacated, the moisture of the birds' bod
ies being necessary to keep the mud
in shape.
