# LABORATORY WITH MAN-MADE LIGHTNING KNOWN AS MOST AMAZING CAMPUS UNIT
## 
### 
Man-made lightning of 2,400,000
volts! Power wires capable of carrying
287,000 volts!
These deadly contrivances have no
terrors for the members of the staff of
the Harris J. Ryan High Voltage Lab
oratory, one of Stanford's most amaz
ing units. This laboratory was con
structed by a group of power compa
nies and manufacturers of electrical
equipment as a tribute to Dr. Ryan
who was formerly its head. The doctor
continued his researches, even after his
retirement, until he died in July, 1934.
His place as director is now filled by
Dr. Joseph S. Carroll.
Staffed by Stanford faculty members,
the laboratory has solved some of the
most difficult problems of electrical en
gineering. Much of the apparatus to
be used in the new power plants and
generators of America is sent there for
testing. The laboratory will undertake
any practical high-voltage problem
brought to it.
The equipment includes the greatest
assembly of high-voltage apparatus
ever brought together. The device of
which the staff is most proud is the
big wattmeter, which was used in mak
ing tests for Boulder Dam.
Perhaps one of the strangest requests
the laboratory has ever had was for
Ijolts of lightning to test a lightning
arrestor used on oil tanks. Other odd
requests were for tests on a three-ton
switch shipped here from Boulder Dam
and for measurement tests on cables
to carry electric current from the dam
to Los Angeles.
Dr. Ryan began his first experiments
with high voltage just after the turn
of the century. At that time, the high
est voltage possible was 15,000. With a
transformer that he constructed while
at Cornell University, Dr. Ryan suc
ceeded in generating more#than six
times that amount.
He came to Stanford in 1906, where
he conducted the majority of his epoch
making experiments. His little labora- \
tory became the mecca of power trans
mission experts and he became known
as the outstanding authority on high
voltage. The present laboratory was I
built in 1926, in order that Dr. Ryan I

i need no longer be hampered by lack
of proper equipment. Since its erection
it has served the entire electrical in
dustry and has solved practical prob
lems for every electrical power com
pany in the West.
All of the laboratory's problems are
not electrical ones. It has had to cre
ate artificial weather conditions, make
dust storms, rainstorms and artificial
sunlight, in order to estimate the prac
ticability of certain types of equipment
under stress. To facilitate this study
the staff has designed a huge tube
which will produce any climate from
London fog to mountain-top clearness.
The Ryan Laboratory is located on
Mayfield Road, away from the Univer
sity buildings. It is a unit of the Stan
ford Electrical Engineering Department
and the building, transmission towers,
and equipment belong to the University.
