# Hooper Foundation Finds Cause of Fish Poisoning
## 
### 
No longer is it possible to accuse
polluted or brackish water of being
the cause of shell-hsh poisoning. The
Hooper Foundation of the University
of California Medical School has found
that microscopic animal organisms eat
en by the shell-fish are the source of
the highly toxic and paralytic poison
carried by them.
The poison can be broken down by
boiling the shell-fish in soda bicar
bonate, but this destroys the flavor of
the Cood. Poisoning is also easily
avoided if only the white meat is eaten
and the liver discarded.
Although the nature and source of
shell-fish poisoning are known, there is
no available remedy to combat it and
it may cause death within two hours.
