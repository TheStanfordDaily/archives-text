# 'Pidgin English' Spoken Among Hawaiian Children
## 
### 
Three out of every five children in
Hawaii speak only a sort of "pidgin
English." The majority of them never
hear English spoken in their homes.
These were the observations of Pro
fessor Lee Emerson Bassett, who re
cently returned to the University after
spending a year on the islands. He
found that the great majority of the
inhabitants are Chinese, Japanese, and
Portuguese immigrants, who speak
only their native tongues at home. The
children hear English only in the
schools.
These schools are wholly inadequate
for the needs of a constantly increasing
population, Professor Bassett stated.
More teachers and more buildings are
needed to take care of the children.
Professor Bassett conducted a course
in the teaching of English at the Uni
versity of Hawaii. He also visited many
islands of the group, consulting more
than 2,000 teachers and professors.
