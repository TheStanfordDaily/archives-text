# COACH PREDICTS GREATEST TEAM FOR WATER POLO
## Says Tentative Fall Line-Up To Have Many Stars As Nucleus 
### 
Coach Norton Thornton reports that
Stanford has potentially one of the
greatest water polo teams that it has
ever had.
In 22 years Stanford has lost only
three games to college teams. Likewise,
Stanford teams have won the Pacific
Coast Water Polo title 21 out of 22
years. In 1928, playing Northwestern
for the National Intercollegiate title,
Stanford won two out of three games
played.
Defeats Bears
Last year Stanford lost its first game
in history to the University of Califor
nia team, but Stanford defeated the
Bears in a return game and subsequent
ly won the championship. The team
won 11 of the 12 games played that
season.
In 1932 the Los Angeles Athletic Club
represented America in the Olympics.
In competition, this team defeated the
whole world except Hungary. In 1933
and 1934 Stanford's team came close to
defeating the southern aggregation. In
one game it was necessary, to play four
extra periods, Stanford finally losing,
5-4.
Coach Thornton has devised a new
system of offense which brings an of
fense patterned after basketball to
water polo. Plays will be worked from
every free throw, something that has
never been tried before. During the
spring practice period of seven weeks
the new system was tried out and
proved to be successful. This is one
reason that Stanford has a good chance
to represent America in the 1936 Olym
pics.
Tentative Line-up
The tentative line-up for the fall will
include Ben Voss, Bill Clemo, and Bob
Hoover as forwards; co-captains Bill
Woodard and Wally Wiget, all-coast
guards from last year; Robert Suther
land and Bob Haslacher, all-coast goal
guard. There are also enough players
for three good teams.
Stanford holds the Northern Califor
nia Water Polo League title and has yel
to be dethroned after three years as
champions. The team, which holds two
titles, is ably coached by Thornton, who
has for the past four years been collect
ing victories for Stanford in water
competition.
