The Muir Woods are older than hu- I
man history—some of its trees more j
than 2,000 years old, rising hundreds of
feet in a serene valley, cause the vis
itor to unconsciously lower his voice i
in this great temple of nature. An hour j
in the Muir Woods will never be for- 1
gotten.
This grove of giant redwoods, whifch I
lies across the Golden Gate only 45 min- i
utes from Market Street, is of such !
beauty and historic interest that the i
federal government has set it aside as j
a national monument.
These woods are the awe-inspiring
approach nature has given to Mt. i
Tamalpais. The "Crookedest Railroad
in the World" has recently been re- j
placed by a highway. But the best ap- ;
| proach to this region is by way of old j
clothes and stout shoes. Thousands hike
the trails from Mill Valley, Ross, and
Fairfax every week-end of the year.
The traveler, who goes on foot, can
enjoy more fully the manzanita and
madrone covered hillsides and the red
woods, many of which are 30 to 40 feet
in circumference. The abundance of
ferns'can only be fully appreciated by
the hiker.
The summit, a half mile above the
j sea, is reached by an easy grade, af-
I fording the hiker a constantly changing
j scene.
From the top of this sacred mountain
j of the Hoo-koo-e-ho Indians, one has
! before him the whole topography of San
j Francisco and its famous bay, in one
| great map. The eye travels as far north
!as Mount "St. Helena, out over the
j Farallone Islands, and then out over
I Oakland and Berkeley to Mt. Diablo.
I High on the north side of the mountain
! are the still waters of Alpine Lake.
As Robert Louis Stevenson said,
"Tamalpais ofTers a delightful lesson
I in geography."
There is no more picturesque spot
than the Tamalpais Mountain Theater,
| where on the third Sunday in May, for
the last 21 years, a suitable play has
been presented in the natural amphi
i theater.

I fording the hiker a constantly changing
j scene.
From the top of this sacred mountain
j of the Hoo-koo-e-ho Indians, one has
! before him the whole topography of San
j Francisco and its famous bay, in one
| great map. The eye travels as far north
!as Mount "St. Helena, out over the
j Farallone Islands, and then out over
I Oakland and Berkeley to Mt. Diablo.
I High on the north side of the mountain
! are the still waters of Alpine Lake.
As Robert Louis Stevenson said,
"Tamalpais ofTers a delightful lesson
I in geography."
There is no more picturesque spot
than the Tamalpais Mountain Theater,
| where on the third Sunday in May, for
the last 21 years, a suitable play has
been presented in the natural amphi
i theater.
