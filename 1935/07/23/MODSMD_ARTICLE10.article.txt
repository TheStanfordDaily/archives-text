Marya Ostrava, interpreter of Slavic
songs, will give a program of Folk
Songs from Slavic Lands, Friday eve
ning at 8 o'clock, in the Assembly Hall.
Though born in America, Marya Os
trava's early musical experience was
distinctly Slavic. The first songs she
knew as a child were folk songs learned
from her Czech mother. The strange
beauty of these melodies heard in early
childhood had a strong influence on her
career, leading her to a comprehensive
study of Slavic folk songs, and implant
ing in her the desire to acquaint Amer
ican audiences with this colorful music,
most of which is quite unknown in
this country.
Particularly she has determined to
present these songs with their authentic
atmosphere and in English, so that hear
ers may fully enjoy their flavor and
deeply human quality. Her present
songs are largely in manuscript, and a
number were translated for her pro
gram and have never, so far as is
known, been heard before in English.
Each principal group will have its own
authentic costume.
