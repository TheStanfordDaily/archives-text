# Preparations Completed For All-University Dance
## 
### 
Preparations are being completed for
the all-University dance to be held in
Toyon Lobby Friday night from 10 to 1.
The committee has secured Eddie
Stirm's popular Brookdale Orchestra
and the hall will be attractively deco
rated with indirect lighting effects.
The committee members are: Burt
Goodman, chairman; Bill Boyd, Bernie
Colley, Bill Smith, and Sid Foorman.
They urge students to buy bids early as
this may be the only University dance
given this quarter.
Bids are now on sale in the A.S.S.U.
office at $1.
