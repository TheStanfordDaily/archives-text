"Survival of the fittest is the result
I of evolution, not its cause," Dr. Ray
• mond Wheeler stated here yesterday in
| speaking of competition. He showed
j that business results in competition,
j but that competition is not the cause of
I business.
"The new developments in physical
and biological sciences are all inter
related. They belong to a cultural
swing correlated with conditions of the
: whole social, political, and economic
structure of the western world," he
! said.
Dr. Wheeler declared the swing al
i ternates between a totalitarian state
i and a socialistic structure. In the past
there has been pre-socialistic thought,
which has been incomplete. This has
, ended in tyranny, such as that of the
medieval church, the absent, monarchy,
! the limited franchise and the fascists
!of today. There have been periods of
1 revolution and wars where the masses
have been freed. These periods bring
changes to the social structure.
Unity in Revolutions
j During these eras of totalitarianism,
' states have emphasized unity, or intcr
relatedness. In the past this emphasis
| has been at the expense of the part, or
the individual. These eras of totality
have been times of depression, while
eras of individual emphasis have been
< times of prosperity.
"Scier ce has the organic point, of
view in the totalitarian periods. Dui -
.ng individualistic eras the atomistic
i theory dominates," Dr. Wheeler said.
The totalitarian view develops the the
ory of co-operation, while the in
dividualistic thought believes in com-
J pettion as a source of progress.
Individual Effort
"Science is today returning to the
j view of the inter-relation theory of
nature rather than the atomic. As a
result we have the idea that progress
and evolution is based on co-operation
rather than on competition. Economic
development is the result of proper
interadjustments of individual effort
I and planning rather than laissez-faire,"
i he said.
Science and philosophy have entered
I another organic era. The essence of
j the Gestalt movement in psychology
) shows the universal trend in human
thought. This philosophy holds that
! the welfare of the individual is best
! guaranteed by putting the welfare of
| the group first.
In speaking of the relation of the new
| psychology to education, Dr. Wheeler
i pointed that our system has been
J based on the atomic rather than the
| organic psychology. As a result we
| have been over-departmentalized, our
1 curriculum lacks unity, the pupil
| doesn't get an integrated idea of life,
of nature, and of the social world. The
. individual doesn't understand the part
' he plays in the world.
Mentally Unadjusted
As a consequence of this atomic edu
| cation we have the mentally unad
j justed individual and personality; the
| disequilibrated economic and political
j structure; and a cultural and institu
