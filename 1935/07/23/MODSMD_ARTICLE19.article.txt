# Wheeler Tells of Psychology and Business
## Atomistic Education Causes Mentally Unadjusted Individual Country May Face Confusion For 20 to 30 Years 
### Benjamin Leese 
"Survival of the fittest is the result
I of evolution, not its cause," Dr. Ray
â€¢ mond Wheeler stated here yesterday in
| speaking of competition. He showed
j that business results in competition,
j but that competition is not the cause of
I business.
"The new developments in physical
and biological sciences are all inter
related. They belong to a cultural
swing correlated with conditions of the
: whole social, political, and economic
structure of the western world," he
! said.
Dr. Wheeler declared the swing al
i ternates between a totalitarian state
i and a socialistic structure. In the past
there has been pre-socialistic thought,
which has been incomplete. This has
, ended in tyranny, such as that of the
medieval church, the absent, monarchy,
! the limited franchise and the fascists
!of today. There have been periods of
1 revolution and wars where the masses
have been freed. These periods bring
changes to the social structure.
Unity in Revolutions
j During these eras of totalitarianism,
' states have emphasized unity, or intcr
relatedness. In the past this emphasis
| has been at the expense of the part, or
the individual. These eras of totality
have been times of depression, while
eras of individual emphasis have been
< times of prosperity.
"Scier ce has the organic point, of
view in the totalitarian periods. Dui -
.ng individualistic eras the atomistic
i theory dominates," Dr. Wheeler said.
The totalitarian view develops the the
ory of co-operation, while the in
dividualistic thought believes in com-
J pettion as a source of progress.
Individual Effort
"Science is today returning to the
j view of the inter-relation theory of
nature rather than the atomic. As a
result we have the idea that progress
and evolution is based on co-operation
rather than on competition. Economic
development is the result of proper
interadjustments of individual effort
I and planning rather than laissez-faire,"
i he said.
Science and philosophy have entered
I another organic era. The essence of
j the Gestalt movement in psychology
) shows the universal trend in human
thought. This philosophy holds that
! the welfare of the individual is best
! guaranteed by putting the welfare of
| the group first.
In speaking of the relation of the new
| psychology to education, Dr. Wheeler
i pointed that our system has been
J based on the atomic rather than the
| organic psychology. As a result we
| have been over-departmentalized, our
1 curriculum lacks unity, the pupil
| doesn't get an integrated idea of life,
of nature, and of the social world. The
. individual doesn't understand the part
' he plays in the world.
Mentally Unadjusted
As a consequence of this atomic edu
| cation we have the mentally unad
j justed individual and personality; the
| disequilibrated economic and political
j structure; and a cultural and institu
tional lag. He pointed out the fact
that many ideas are obsolete by the
time the child becomes independent of
school.
Makes Predictions
Dr. Wheeler feels that a few general
predictions can be made on the basis
ot the periodic fluctuations of view
points. He said that we are due for 20
to 30 years of confusion, a revolution
ary age with civil and imperialistic
wars out of which a more unified west
ern world should emerge. Because of
these fluctuations and their ironing out
in the West, a stable society based on
the balanced recognition of the individ
ual and the social whole may come in
50 to 70 years.
Revival of Religion
"The human race has not done any
thing original of fundamental import
ance for 300 years,' since it accepted the
physical and biological sciences and
built an mdividualistc civilization based
on physical and medical science. They
accepted the natural laws in environ
ment and in their physical being. Now
the public needs to discover the laws
of human nature and society. Accept
ance of the laws of psychology and so
cial science will be the next big step,"
he stated.
"This procedure or phase (of the new
movement) will be a revival of Chris
tianity or religion as a power in the
world rather than a refuge," he said in
conclusion.

j Fifteen years of interest in the new
movement, Gestalt psychology, has
prompted Dr. Wheeler to write four
books. He has written a "Science of
Psychology," "Readings in Psychology,"
"Laws of Psychology," and with Dr.
F. T. Perkins of the University of Kan
sas collaborating "The Principles of
, Mental Development."
During the war he worked on the
Army Beta tests. He said the tests were
of great value in weeding out the feeble
minded and unstable and in helping
place the more intelligent recruits in
! responsible positions.
