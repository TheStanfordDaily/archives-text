# American Music

II is gratifying to hear one ol' the really fine musicians of our
connlry give a good word lor our American music. Nothing Amer
ican has heen so completely smothered as our appreciation ol our
own music. Yel we have the hesl that there is to oiler along the
lines ol training for a musical career. We have brilliant composers
and musicians whose themes and ideas are strictly new and Amer
ican hut their efforts seem to go to naught.
No institution reflects the conduct, morals, thought, and man
ners ol a nation as much or more than that of a country's music.
'I he folksongs, melodies, compositions, and symphonies of each
nation are individual and should stand out as something distinct
and apart from those of others.
Dr. Sigfrid Prager, director of civic music at Madison, Wiscon
sin, dehunked one ol the lavorite existing ideas that we must go
abroad lor our musical talent, conductors, and directors whose
names have a foreign sound. He expressed the viewpoint in a
recent Daily interview that we should have our type of music. It
is a lamentable I act that so much good American musical talent
has gone to waste, due to the ctlect, no doubt, of those who in
their artificial way know little about music anyway, and merely go
lo hear some renowned conductor, artist, or composer just because
he is of foreign lineage or his name sounds "aristocratic." It is the
same llare, we suppose, which makes gullible Americans wish to be
presented to the Court ol St. James. The type of person who be
lieves in these fallacies is no doubt responsible for the raising of
the price for tickets to good concerts out of the price-class of those
who really enjoy such fine renditions. It is said that those who
honestly enjoy performances of grand opera sit in the gallery, while
those who wisl'j to show oil' sit in the sky-high priced seats.
Let us give our own composers and compositions a chance and
strive lor a true appreciation of all music, including our own, with
out the three-ring circus effect which does much to lessen apprecia
tion of music and musicians for the average American.â€”J. F. M.
