# Get Your Dance Bids
## 
### 
A paradoxical situation con fronts the campus. In answer to
many requests for social activities the student group in Toyon Hall
has announced a dance to he held Friday. With only a few davs
unlil this dance, the hid sale has heen surprisingly small.
II we expect to have campus social activity, the least we can do
is support it. Those who so loudly crusaded for such an affair should
rid behind this dance and sec that the informal event is a success
