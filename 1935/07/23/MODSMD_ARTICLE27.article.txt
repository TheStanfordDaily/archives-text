# Food Factor Discovered As Entirely New Vitamin
## 
### 
An essential poultry food factor, at
first believed to be vitamin G by its
discoverers in the University of Wis- i
cousin, has been developed as an en- ,
tirely new vitamin, in research activi- 1
ties conducted by the University of
California at Davis and Berkeley. Be
cause the lack of the new element
caused a pellagra like disease in baby
chicks, the discoverers believed that
they were working with vitamin G.
However, tests on rats at the Univer
sity of California showed that it was not
vitamin G, but an entirely new sub
stance. It was found that chicks could
not grow without a supply of both the
new vitdmin and of vitamin G. This
was shown by means of heat-treated
rlicts of natural feeds.
