# Spirit of the West Lives Again As Cowboys Raise Dust At Rodeo
## 
### 
The Wild West in all its historical .
glamour came to life again with the '
celebration of the Salinas Rodeo, July
18 to 21.
A pageant of color, this yearly re
vival of the old-time celebration of the 1
Spanish vaqueros draws thousands of
'spectators from all parts of the country. ]
For a period of four days the entire
town goes "western." Young and old
alike wear ten-gallon hats, gaudy
shirts and high-heeled riding boots. I
Horses and automobiles mingle on the
main street, and the squeak of saddle
leather predominates.
Colorful Parade
At 1 o'clock the parade starts through
the town. Riding everything from the ,
finest blooded cattle horses down to ,
the lowly burro, 1000 persons engage in
this colorful procession. Gayly colored
shirts, pearl white Stetson hats, silver
mounted saddles, and buckwing chaps,
i all combine to create an everchanging
spectacle of vivid color.
Slowly this procession advances to
the area outside the town where at 2
o'clock the show begins.
Exciting Minutes
We're inside the area, sitting in the
huge grandstand that faces the race 1
track and corral. A voice from the [
announcing speaker says," Peter Knight

coming out on Pretty Sox. Watch chute
number twelve." "Oie gate is swung
open, a starting gun is fired, and Pete
comes out on a pile of horse flesh that's
plenty mad. With head down, back
arched, and hoofs pounding the dust,
Pretty Sox, as tough a bronc as ever
came off the range, is doing his best
to throw the tenacious Pete. But Pete
dies hard, and all the time he's dig
ging his spurs into Pretty Sox, waving
his hat, and yelling bloody murder.
Ten seconds of this bucking, rolling,
and pitching, and the whistle blows.
The pick-up man rides out and with his
aid, Pete swings off the bronc and his
ride is finished. Most of the riders are
not as lucky as Pete, however, and
many leave the saddle in the middle
of their ride to describe flying arcs
and land in the dust.
A Varied Program
Trick roping and riding add to the
entertainment, and further display the
art of the cowboy.
