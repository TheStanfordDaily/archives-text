# SCIENCE DISCUSSED IN RADIO ADDRESS

"By comparison with the electrical
currents which flow through our lamps
and door bells, these tiny impulses are
as the drip of the faucet to a thousand
Niagaras," said Dr. Paul Kirkpatrick
when speaking of measurement of in
finitesimal currents to his radio audi
cnce last night during the Stanford
Hour.
Mentioning the general disorder as
sociated with the experimental labora
tory, he pointed out that the jungle of
apparatus represents equipment which
is practically always in the develop
ment stage. It is always being torn
down and adjusted to some new func
tion. "Pioneers and trail breakers
through a wilderness are not expected
to linger to build concrete highways,"
he said.
Contrasts Old and New Methods
The general public still thinks of the
scientific discoverer as somewhat of an
alchemist, who pours and boils aim
lessly, until by luck something of value
is found. Dr. Kirkpatrick said that such
grab-bag methods no longer yield re
sults in the search for the undiscovered
truths of physics, chemistry, or biology.
"Unless we are very blind, these im
portant and easily available discoveries
are now all cleaned up," he stated in
discussing Newton's work.
In contrast to the old methods, our
modern scientist asks* nature very spe
cific and pointed questions. In asking
and in getting answers, elaborate and
mystifying contrivances are employed.
Because the instruments developed
for the measurement of electricity have
been proven to be so precise, they are
used extensively by the physicist.
Whenever some physical quantity, such
as pressure, temperature, time, the
strength of a beam of light, or the loud
ness of noise requires precise Measure
ment, attempts are made to involve the
unknown into some electrical effect to
facilitate measurement.
Describes Electrometer
Dr. Kirkpatrick described the elec
trometer of Hoffman. This instrument
uses a single platinum wire drawn so
fine that half a million of them laid to
gether would make a bundle only a
little thicker than a common pin.
"A few thousand men and women
apply themselves to the entertaining
and, for the most part, unsystematic
task of piecing together the jig-saw
picture of the universe and its mechan
isms," he said, comparing areas of
knowledge with isolated spots of a
vast mosaic.
To complete the picture, a world
wide economy with a long range plan
would devote its first few centuries to
research. While this is impossible as
society is now organized, greater sup
port of research would increase the
benefits of science. Speaking of the
support needed he concluded, "If we
find these things (scientific inventions)
desirable and expect to receive more
of their kind, we must insure the con
tinued association of the scientific re
searcher and his strange playthings."

vast mosaic.
To complete the picture, a world
wide economy with a long range plan
would devote its first few centuries to
research. While this is impossible as
society is now organized, greater sup
port of research would increase the
benefits of science. Speaking of the
support needed he concluded, "If we
find these things (scientific inventions)
desirable and expect to receive more
of their kind, we must insure the con
tinued association of the scientific re
searcher and his strange playthings."
"By comparison with the electrical
currents which flow through our lamps
and door bells, these tiny impulses are
as the drip of the faucet to a thousand
Niagaras," said Dr. Paul Kirkpatrick
when speaking of measurement of in
finitesimal currents to his radio audi
cnce last night during the Stanford
Hour.
Mentioning the general disorder as
sociated with the experimental labora
tory, he pointed out that the jungle of
apparatus represents equipment which
is practically always in the develop
ment stage. It is always being torn
down and adjusted to some new func
tion. "Pioneers and trail breakers
through a wilderness are not expected
to linger to build concrete highways,"
he said.
Contrasts Old and New Methods
The general public still thinks of the
scientific discoverer as somewhat of an
alchemist, who pours and boils aim
lessly, until by luck something of value
is found. Dr. Kirkpatrick said that such
grab-bag methods no longer yield re
sults in the search for the undiscovered
truths of physics, chemistry, or biology.
"Unless we are very blind, these im
portant and easily available discoveries
are now all cleaned up," he stated in
discussing Newton's work.
In contrast to the old methods, our
modern scientist asks* nature very spe
cific and pointed questions. In asking
and in getting answers, elaborate and
mystifying contrivances are employed.
Because the instruments developed
for the measurement of electricity have
been proven to be so precise, they are
used extensively by the physicist.
Whenever some physical quantity, such
as pressure, temperature, time, the
strength of a beam of light, or the loud
ness of noise requires precise Measure
ment, attempts are made to involve the
unknown into some electrical effect to
facilitate measurement.
Describes Electrometer
Dr. Kirkpatrick described the elec
trometer of Hoffman. This instrument
uses a single platinum wire drawn so
fine that half a million of them laid to
gether would make a bundle only a
little thicker than a common pin.
"A few thousand men and women
apply themselves to the entertaining
and, for the most part, unsystematic
task of piecing together the jig-saw
picture of the universe and its mechan
isms," he said, comparing areas of
knowledge with isolated spots of a
vast mosaic.
