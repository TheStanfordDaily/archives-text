## 
### 
Alan Ci'anston, Palo Alto, and John
Atkinson, South Pasadena, quarter
miler and pole vaulter, respectively, on
the Stanford track team, were recently
reported to have joined a group of
students from the University of Mexico
in an attempt to dislodge To
mas Garrido Canabal, "dictator" of the
state of Tabasco.
Following the killing of five students
who had gone to Tabasco to vote
against Canabal, an organization was
formed at the university to enter the
state in August and vote against Cana
bal. Cranston and Atkinson, who are
attending summer school in Mexico
City, are reported to have joined the
movement.
