# SWALLOWS ARE PEEVED Poor Relations Disowned DAILY CAUSES TWITTER

Tlie Editor, Sir:
Having had my curiosity aroused by
the great concourse of Stanford swal
lows wheeling and darting above the
home of the Daily Thursday afternoon
and this morning, I could not but ob
serve that there was something unusual
in their behavior. They seemed more
than ordinarily intent, in their graceful
maneuvers, of maintaining a relatively
fixed position in the air, a custom quite
unusual in the aerial acrobatics of the
swallow.
I pondered over this phenomenon
until my eye chanced to alight once
more on an article in the Thursday
Daily referring to, the swallows. The
explanation for the concentration of
the swallows over the Daily office at
once became clear. The poor little
dears were passing on the well-known
I "bird" in their most eloquent manner
I to the ornithologist of the Daily staff.
Theirs was a mute protest against the
shameful indignity of being referred to
so patronizingly as "barn swallows."
The aristocrats of the brownstone man
sions had been mistaken for their poor
country relations, for our Stanford
dainties are properly styled "cliff swal
lows." The slip doubtless had arisen
from confusing associations with the
term "Farm."
