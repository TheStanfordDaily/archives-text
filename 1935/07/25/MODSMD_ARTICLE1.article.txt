"The coming conference of the Cali
fornia Society of Secondary Education
will offer an opportunity to secondary
teachers to attend a conference where
their specific educational interests may
be discussed," A. C. Argo, director of
the meeting and principal of the Se
quoia Union High School, Redwood
Cily, stated here today. The conference
will be held at Stanford August 2 and 3.
This meeting is one of a series of
four or five regional gatherings de
voted to secondary education. Teachers
from the North Coast section and the
Bay region will be represented.
"We will have a fine group of edu
cators participating," Mr. Argo stated.
Among them will be Dr. Rudolph
Lindquist of Ohio State University and
Dr. Raymond Wheeler of the Univer
sity of Kansas. Dean Grayson Kefau
ver of Stanford is to be chairman of
the meetings.
Throughout the meeting the panel
method will be used. A prominent
speaker sets up the problem, which is
then discussed by a panel composed of
experts in the various secondary fields.
An opportunity will be given those in
the audience to speak who wish to pre
sent their reactions.
The high-light of the meeting is to
be the presentation of reports covering
the curriculum of the four high schools
named by the State Department of Ed
ucation as experimental schools.
While the meeting is primarily in
tended for teachers, principals, and
board members representing the sec
ondary field, Mr. Argo extended an in
vitation to the general public to attend
the sessions, which will begin Friday
morning, August 2, and end Saturday
afternoon. There will be no charge at
any of the sessions, except for the Fri
