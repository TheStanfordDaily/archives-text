Marya Ostrava will bring to Stanford
i an art that is peculiarly her own when
i she presents "Songs from Slavic Lands"
I Friday night at 8 o'clock in the Assem
i bly Hall.
Marya Ostrava has evolved a new
j art, that of folk song presentation. Her
! program is novel in both material and
presentation. By means of graphic de
i script ion, elaborate pantomime, and
| costumes, the songs occur spontaneous
; ly and become vivid and meaningful.
I Miss Ostrava will sing all of the
{ songs in English to enable the audience
to enjoy their rich human quality. A "
i number were translated for this pro-
I gram and have never before been heard
in English.
I Miss Ostrava was born in America.
! Tlie first songs that she knew as a
! child were learned from her Czechish
j mother. She has made an extensive
i study of Slavic folk songs and desires
j to acquaint the American people with
I the strange beauty of these melodies.
Hillen Burton will assist at the piano,
j She is one of the notable younger pian
j ists of Southern California and her solo
| numbers will be an addition to the
! program.
The program, presented under the
| auspices of the Committee on Public
] Exercises, is as follows:
