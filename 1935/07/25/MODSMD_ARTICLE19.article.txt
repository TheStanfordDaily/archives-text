# The New Gold Vault
## 
### 
I o store more safely some of America's vast gold reserve, the
government will build a new vault at Forth Worth, Kentucky. With
walls ot concrete and steel four feet thick and supported on pillars
to enable guards to patrol it on four sides, it may well l>e called the
latest in artificial gold mines.
In one part of the earth, nations struggle through economic
doldrums because they have no gold; in another, a nation lloundcrs
through a great depression because, for one important reason, it
has too much gold.
I he metal ilsell has a history around which an infinite amount
of human misery and even blood has been wasted. It is dug up
from the ground al great cost, fought over, and then it is carefully
buried again in elaborate dungeons and guarded from sight or
use.â€”J. W. I>.
