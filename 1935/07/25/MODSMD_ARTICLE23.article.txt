Farm, formerly the Gordon estate, was
purchased by Mr. Stanford and named
Palo Alto because of his great admira
tion for the two big trees.

shall be our children," persuaded her
! that a co-educational institution would
! be better.

had been made, Mr. Stanford formed
the by-laws, dictating them off-hand
and with notes. To this day they re
