One certain Mr. Clifford Odetts has
1 injected adrenalin into the "veins "of a
theater slowly dying of mediocrity. He
has brought new life to the stage in the
I form of three new plays, "Awake and
. Sing," "Waiting for Lefty,"Till
the Day I Die." 1 x
Even in reading these play£ "In the
• script, one can easily sensd
j of power, of vitality, of importance. It
i is a new theater that Mr. Odetts is es
i tablishing—a theater of purpose and of
■ | social and political ambition. There is
' j ho wistful release in Mr. Odett's worii.
and ihe relaxation-seeking play-goer
will be severely forced to view a picture,
of life that finds its reflection on every
street in America. Mr. Odetts plays are
( in themselves a history of these soul
trying times.
The author brings home'(lie 4htnSe
of his work when he states that it is
the story of a struggle for life among
petty circumstances. "Awake and
Sing," in portraying the life of a hard
pressed city family, startles one with
its realism, its undeniable truth. The
brilliance of Mr. Odett's study in char
acter brings his work into sharp relief
and his characters emerge from the
pages and march in living procession.
"Waiting for Lefty," a grim picture
of present-day conditions r.AcI hopeless
lives, argues Mr. Odett's thesis with
bitter persuasion. The humor in this
work is the type which is motivated by
the same reaction that causes one to
whistle while walking through a grave
yard on a dark and dreary night.
"Till the Day I Die," a story of "un
derground" political activities in Nazi
Germany, is a little less gripping but
j still consistently in the manner of
i Odetts.
If you seek life and vitality in your
I play diet, read this* book of plays by
| all means. —David Brown
