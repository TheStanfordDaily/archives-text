# "Outlaws" Smother Californians Under Avalanche of Base-Knocks
## 
### JAY McBROOM 
Those rough and tough lads from the
sale-brush land, the "Oullaws," de
feated the native California "Blow
hard" soft-ball contingent of the School
of Education "World Series," in two
games, 5-3 and 10-5.
The series ended with the score in
games two for the Outlaws and one
for the Californians. It seems that the
first game was scheduled for 7 innings
but lo and behold, the native sons were
in arrears by several needed tallies,
so in their most diplomatic manner the
Californians suggested that two more
innings be played.
The series was bitterly fought and
the "Blowhards" showed magnificent
ability to talk a good ball game. Their
terrific hitting power was shown by two
bunts and a foul ball as their total num
ber of base hits. The mystery of the
series seems to be why and how the
Californians were able to garner any
runs at all.
They took the defeat good naturedly,
however, just cussing and using invec
tives such as
"shaw" and "oh
shucks" in a deri
sive manner.
For the "Out
laws," the stars
were Kutsch of
Oregon, who
smacked 'em in
the clutches, and
"Red Dizzy Dean"
Dyer from the
sage brush coun
try of Arizona, who dusted the Cali
fornia flowers ofl" with monotonous
regularity. Fields, center fielder, also
from Arizona, did sensational work in
the outer garden. The latest reports
have it that the California team will
protest to the Tsar of Baseball in order
to have them black-balled from edu
cational baseball games. The charge
will be that they possess real ball
playing ability.
The "Blowhards" seem to lack a
first-string starting pitcher as "Flatty"
Fox, "Funny" Manner, and "Patty"
Patterson were able to dish out fence
balls only. It may be said in their be
half, however, that they didn't get any
support in the field. There were no
fences, which made it bad.
"Pepper" Zanon, the Roseville won
der kid from down by the "Wenager
Works," proved himself to be quite a
ball player. It is expected that he will
draw his unconditional release imme
diately for breaking the rule of throw
ing correctly to first base. The famous
reported million-dollar keystone-sack
combination failed to materialize for
the natives, as rookie "Dud Loudmouth"

Kennedy 'proved to be unable to throw
from third to shortstop. Kennedy was
carried from the field with froth
coated lips due to
his extreme exer
cise of shooting
off his mouth.
Due to their
loss to the "Out
laws" the "Blow
hards" will be
shifted to a minor
league. They will
play their first
contest with the education faculty Fri
day afternoon. The faculty will pre
sent a new system of playing motiva
tion developed by Manager Kefauver
and the only team of soft bailers worse
than the "Blowhards" ever to be as
sembled. Included in their line-up will
be "Deany" Kefauver, who will dish
out educational spitters from the
mound. Receiving 'em behind the plat
ter will be "Gabby" C. Hand, sensa
tional young Columbia U. product who
intends to revamp the entire ball
playing system. Last but not least, it
is reported that "Johnny" Almack,
veteran of many hard-fought cam
paigns, will appear at the initial sack.
To match the stupendous array of
stars for the faculty, the "Blowhards"
will present a revamped line-up in
cluding some well-known stars.
Some of the well-known athletes
who will be seen in action are: Joshua
"Ladies' Man"
Montgomery, the
world's .tallest
and most awk
ward first-sacker,
"Hop 'em Up"
John Elia from
Fresno will be
shipped in from
the Raisin City to
labor in the
mound, and "East. Nicolaus" Peterson,
commonly known as the "all-educa
tional-out," will slip blithely among
the posies in the outer garden.
