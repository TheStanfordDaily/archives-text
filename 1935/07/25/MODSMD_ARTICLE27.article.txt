# Campus Window Washing To Occupy Two Months
## 
### 
Each of the 36.000 panes of glass in
campus windows will get its yearly
bath some time during the next 10
weeks. A crew of three window wash
ers started work early this week and
will be busy until late in September.
Probably the biggest job will be
washing the windows in the library,
those on the east side of this building
alone containing 3,600 panes.
With the exception of the windows
in the Administration Building, which
are cleaned more often, this work is
done only once a year and is more
than a two months' job for union win
dow washers brought from San Fran
cisco.
In the good old days Encina was
equipped with elevators.
