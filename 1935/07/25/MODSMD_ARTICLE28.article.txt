# STUDENT BOARDING PLAN SUCCESSFUL
## 
### 
BERKELEY.â€”The determination of
the average male collegian to obtain a
university education "at any cost" is
being exemplified in striking fashion
by the University of California Stu
dents Co-operative Association, which
; is preparing to house, feed, entertain,
! and generally watch out for a total of
250 students during the coming college
year, at $17.50 per student per month.
! The regimen of the association, which
is a regularly organized California cor
i poration, includes a comfortable room,
three meals a day prepared under the
j advisory direction of University dietary
experts, laundry work, recreation, in
cluding dances and participation in in
termural sports, all for the price named.
So popular has the movement become
j that it was necessary recently to lease
an apartment building of 140 rooms in
I addition to the accommodations already
on hand. This is fully furnished, warm
ed by oil-fired furnaces and up-to-date
|in every particular. It will accommo
i date 200 boys without crowding.
Another establishment provides for
[ a total of (i 0 students under the same
i conditions. Both houses are situated
! within a few blocks of the campus.
Under the present system of opera
tion all expenses are prorated and each
| boy works on an average of three and
one-half hours a week doing the neces
sary chores about the establishment.
The only paid employes are a cook and
j.a general executive, who also attend
to all bookkeeping details.
The corporation has now been operat
ing for more than a year, and has been
successful from the outset. The concern
; is student managed and student oper
ated throughout and thus has been
helpful, not only in caring for thrifty
students but as somewhat of a labora
tory for practical economics. At pres
ent there is a waiting list of some 25
boys, which is bound to be much big
ger before the fall semester opens.
Backers of the unique corporation
see in it the Genesis of a permanent
; boys' dormitory system for the Univer
j sity in which the students will even-
I tually own the buildings used.
