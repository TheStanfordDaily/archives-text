# Thornhill Nominated for Coach
## Alumni, Merchants Sponsor Elction of 'Tiny' For Position 
### Carlos Monsalve 
Campus supporters as well as local J
merchants and alumni are determined
lo have Tiny Thornhill, Stanford's foot- j
hall coach, elected to act as coach for
the Collegiate Ail-Star team which is i
sponsored by the Chicago Tribune.
The all-star team is composed of out
standing college players throughout the j
United States who have finished their '
undergraduate work. They are selected j
by a nation-wide poll conducted in the
same manner as will be the selection :
of the coach, votes being sent to sports !
departments of representative papers
throughout the country.
Stepping into a place vacated at
Stanford two years ago by Glenn "Pop"
Warner was no easy task for Tiny, but j
he proved his ability by winning the j
Pacific Coast Conference for the two i
years he has been head coach. This I
should be sufficient to qualify the pres- !
cnt Stanford coach for the all-star i
berth.
Tiny was selected as an all-American
tackle at Pittsburgh in 1916. Since that
time he has been selected on many of
the all-time Pitt teams. He played on
and coached professional teams after 1
leaving Pitt, and in 1920 he was as
sistant coach of the famous "Praying
Colonels" of Center College that sur
prised the sport world by beating
Harvard.
Promoted to Head Coach in 19112
When Pop Warner was signed to
coach Stanford in 1922 he was unable to
leave Pittsburgh until 11)24. Pop sent
Andy Kerr and Tiny Thornhill to lay
Ihe foundation for the Warner regime.
Tiny was line coach and held that posi
tion until .1932, when he was promoted
to the head position.
During the two years Tiny has been
head coach, Stanford teams have played
22 games, 17 of which were victories,
3 losses, and 2 ties. Stanford has only
lost to one Pacific Coast team, and that
was to Washington in 1933. Likewise,
Stanford was tied by only one Pacific
Coast team, and that was Santa Clara
last year. In the two seasons Stanford
defeated both California and Southern
California, which is something that
Stanford teams had not accomplished
since 1926.
Developed Many Stars
In the 22 games played, Stanford
scored 355 points to the opposition's 86.
Thirteen teams were unable to score
against the Indians. Under Tiny's di
rection Stanford won the Pacific Coast
Conference and was western repre
sentative in the Rose Bowl for 1933 and
1934.
Tiny was responsible for developing
such stars as Jim Lawson, Ted Shipkey,
Don Robesky, Seraphim Post, Walt
Heincke, and Bill Corbus, all of whom

were all-Americans. Besides these he
developed a tremendous number of out- j
standing linemen.
In the 1934 season Stanford had three j
1 generally recognized all-Americans, :
Bob Grayson, Jim Moscrip, and Bob
Reynolds. Bones Hamilton was chosen
by a vote of all players (sponsored by
; the Liberty magazine) as the outstand
; ing football player in America.
Tiny Thornhill has proven, by the
teams and men he has developed, that
he would make an excellent coach for
the Collegiate All-Stars. Accompany
ing this story is a ballot which, when
filled out and sent to the Sports Depart
ment of the San Francisco Chronicle,
will cast a vote for "Our Coach Tiny." 1
This ballot is supplied as a convenience.
Backers of the "Thornhill for Coach"
movement urge students to persuade
| their friends and family to cast votes

simply by writing Tiny's name on a
piece of paper and mailing it to the
sports department of the San Francisco
Chronicle or the Los Angeles Times.
