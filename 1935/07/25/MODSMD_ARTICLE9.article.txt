# Dr. Geiger, On Third Visit to America, Gives Impression of Universities Here
## Impressed with Difference Betwen Countries' Curriculum 
### 
An interest in American philosophy |
brought Dr. Moritz Alfred Geiger from
Germany to Harvard 28 years ago. At j
that time William James and Royce \
were at Harvard.
Dr. Geiger received his doctor's de
gree in philosophy and psychology at
Munich where he became a professor of
philosophy. He is now head of the phi
losophy department at Vassar and is !
acting as professor of philosophy at j
Stanford during the summer quarter.
This is Dr. Geiger's third visit to i
America. He is impressed with the dif- I
ference between German and American
universities. In Germany, a university i
is thought of as a professional or scien- t
tific school but not as an institution for i
general culture. Another great differ
ence is a "type of academic freedom j
with its positive and negative sides" that
is characteristic of German education.
The only examinations are those given
after from two to four years of study, i
and of these are given by the \
state.
The German student chooses a uni- i
versity for a specific professor or for j
its location in a specific city. It is the I
custom to change universities fre- j
quently. The students do not live in j
dormitories but in the cities. This gives j

a possibility for greater freedom but for
less social life within the university.
The universities in Germany arc all
i state universities. Consequently there
;is less difference among them. They
are all co-educational but because of
' their professional nature, few women
| attend.
Dr. Geiger said he thought that the
American student was as responsive as
! the German student, considering that
j he is several years younger.
