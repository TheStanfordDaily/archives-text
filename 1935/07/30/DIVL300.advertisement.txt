# Maybe the dough-heavy college playboy of your
father's time could burn his twenty-dollar bills
to make a big impression on his latest flame, but
it's a lot different today. You college students
must spend your allowance wisely and make
every dollar count.
â€¢ That is the reason we recommend that you
patronize DAILY advertisers. Without excep

.modern business trends and are prepared to

spend.
