# Morgan Talks On Folk Songs For NBC Hour
## Origin and Nature of German Folk Music Is Theme Of Address Its Simplicity and Uniformity Are Characteristic

"Folksong Ls not always of the folk.
It may deal with kings and princes as
well as commoners," explained Dr.
Bayard Quincy Morgan in speaking of
"German Folksongs" on the Stanford
Radio Hour last night.
Dr. Morgan continued by saying that
the words are always written by the
folk. It is anonymous to start with, or
soon becomes so. It is essentially time
less, never beginning and never ending.
"Folksong, then, is that body of words
plus tunes that live on the lips and in
the hearts of the people."
In distinguishing between the folk
song and the folktale, Dr. Morgan
pointed out that the folktale is a solo
aflair while the folksong is a choral.
In the folksong the performer and au
dience are identical.
He said, "To one who has grown up
in the poverty of our American musical
life, it is always astonishing to observe
how many songs the average German
can sing, and how many stanzas of each
song he knows by heart."
In pointing out their wealth and va
riety, Dr. Morgan stated that Germany
possesses about 2,000 folksongs which
are sung at the present time.
In considering the music of German
folksongs, the speaker said, "It seems
to me unlikely that the tunes are the
creation of the common people. Most
of them, I believe, derive from skilled
musicians, either by adaptation or by
direct borrowing."
The simple straightforward melodic
form, the moderate range, and the uni
formity of German folksongs were
pointed out by Dr. Morgan in his con
clusion when he discussed the com
monest groups.
