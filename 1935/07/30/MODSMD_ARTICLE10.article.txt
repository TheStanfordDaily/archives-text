# BABIES TIED IN NEST By Mother Hummingbird HOME IS CAMOUFLAGED

### 
The recent prominence in the news
of the nest-building activities on the
Quad of the cliff swallows brought a
story from Buck Walsh, gardener at
Lagunita, about the domestic difficulties
of a hummingbird and her offspring.
The only tree that Mrs. Humming
bird could find in Lagunita Court was
not much more than a sapling, and it
was in a prominent place. However,
most of the Lagunita women passed
that tree every day, but none of them
saw the nest.
Little Mrs. Hummingbird wasn't in
the World War, but she knew all about
"camouflage." She found bits of moss
that were exactly the color of the bark,
and she wove her nest so cleverly that
it couldn't be detected unless you were
in on the secret.
But disguising the nest didn't end
Mrs. Hummingbird's problems. As long
as her babies were only eggs every
thing was all right; but after they'd
hatched out, it was another matter.
Tlie tree bobbed around like a jumping
jack ev?ry time the wind blew. Mrs.
Hummingbird was afraid to leave the
babies for fear they'd fall out. And
yet, how was she to feed them if she
stayed on the nest all the time?
It was a tough problem, but Mrs.
Hummingbird solved it by the simple
process of tieing her babies into the nest
with threads around their feet. Mrs.
Hummingbird was free to come and go*
knowing that they couldn't fall out if
they wanted to.
The babies aren't there any more.
They've grown up now and are prob
ably out raising families of their own,
but the nest is still there, and Mr.
Walsh exhibits it proudly to visitors.
