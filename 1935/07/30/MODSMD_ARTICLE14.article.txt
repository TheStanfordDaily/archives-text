Mr. Stone is well known for his pio
neer work in the field of visual educa
tion. In 1916, while yet a student in
the University of California, he pro
duced the notable film entitled "How
Life Begins," which won him interna
tional recognition. The success of this
film gained him a position with the
firm of Prizma, Inc., where he spent
a year making natural color films of
growing flowers, microscopic life, and
other subjects of natural history.
Success in Army
With America's entry into the war
he was engaged as a lecturer under
the Fosdick Commission to present his
film to some 50,000 soldiers in the army
camps. His success was so marked
that the work was soon taken over as
an activity of the Y.M.C.A., which
trained a corps of lecturers to carry on
large-scale work in America and
France later.
Mr. Stone was then commissioned as
an officer in the Signal Corps and went
to France to help compile a photo
graphic record of the war. His work
first dealt with records of reconstruc
tion and rehabilitation as well as with
the harrowing scenes in the hospitals.
Thereafter he was sent to the front and
served as photographic officer of the
First Army Corps throughout the en
tire Argonne offensive.
Spends Year in Europe
Since the war Mr. Stone has con
tinued his work in photography. Re
cently he spent a year in Europe where
he made a tour of the Continent, ob
serving and photographing. He was
accorded unusual privileges, including
the right to photograph all the art
treasures in the public galleries of
Italy. Now he returns with fresh ma
terial and enthusiasm to resume his
work.
In his lecture on "The Spirit of
Italy" Mr. Stone takes his audience by
auto from the Austrian frontier down
to Lago di Garda and thence to Flor
ence. Here, he pauses to show many of
the beauties of that ancient and his
toric city. After a visit to the churches
and galleries he proceeds via the Hill
Towns to Rome, where he shows a gen
eral view of the Imperial City and
the treasures of its galleries. Thence to
Naples, to Pompeii, to Paestum, around
the Amalfi Drive, and finally to the
summit of Vesuvius.

treasures in the public galleries of
Italy. Now he returns with fresh ma
terial and enthusiasm to resume his
work.
In his lecture on "The Spirit of
Italy" Mr. Stone takes his audience by
auto from the Austrian frontier down
to Lago di Garda and thence to Flor
ence. Here, he pauses to show many of
the beauties of that ancient and his
toric city. After a visit to the churches
and galleries he proceeds via the Hill
Towns to Rome, where he shows a gen
eral view of the Imperial City and
the treasures of its galleries. Thence to
Naples, to Pompeii, to Paestum, around
the Amalfi Drive, and finally to the
summit of Vesuvius.
"The Spirity of Italy" will be the sub
ject of an illustrated lecture by George
E. Stone, head of the Department of
Photography (visual education) at the
San Jose State Teachers College to
night at 8 o'clock in the Assembly
Hall.
Mr. Stone is well known for his pio
neer work in the field of visual educa
tion. In 1916, while yet a student in
the University of California, he pro
duced the notable film entitled "How
Life Begins," which won him interna
tional recognition. The success of this
film gained him a position with the
firm of Prizma, Inc., where he spent
a year making natural color films of
growing flowers, microscopic life, and
other subjects of natural history.
Success in Army
With America's entry into the war
he was engaged as a lecturer under
the Fosdick Commission to present his
film to some 50,000 soldiers in the army
camps. His success was so marked
that the work was soon taken over as
an activity of the Y.M.C.A., which
trained a corps of lecturers to carry on
large-scale work in America and
France later.
Mr. Stone was then commissioned as
an officer in the Signal Corps and went
to France to help compile a photo
graphic record of the war. His work
first dealt with records of reconstruc
tion and rehabilitation as well as with
the harrowing scenes in the hospitals.
Thereafter he was sent to the front and
served as photographic officer of the
First Army Corps throughout the en
tire Argonne offensive.
Spends Year in Europe
Since the war Mr. Stone has con
tinued his work in photography. Re
cently he spent a year in Europe where
he made a tour of the Continent, ob
serving and photographing. He was
accorded unusual privileges, including
the right to photograph all the art
treasures in the public galleries of
Italy. Now he returns with fresh ma
terial and enthusiasm to resume his
work.
