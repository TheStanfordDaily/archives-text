# The 						Quad by Moonlight
## 
### 
10 ho a true Stanford student, one must take a walk alone on
the Quad in the moonlight.
11 is essential that you be alone, for only then can you fully
appreciate and experience the deep calm and serenity which is
yours at that time. Another person, he he friend or acquaintance,
unconsciously changes the entire atmosphere, and the intangible
cssence of the adventure is lost.
Walk slowly across the Inner Quad. Stop by each "island."
There is no sound except the rusUe of the giant palms and the faint
sleepy chirp of a bird. The free, wide sweep of the star-studded sky
is never to be forgotten. Pause half-way across to the Memorial
Aich and diicctly before the (.Impel. See how the moon, hidden
behind the Church, surrounds it with a halo of light, making
its beauty even more breath-taking than before.
Stroll in the darkness of the arches. Walk through the Memorial
Court, down the steps, and out on to the Oval. The moon, gliding
high in the heavens and casting a silvery veil over the buildings of
the University, makes the entire scene fceem almost of another
world.â€”E. L. B.
