# Best Cinders To Be Used On New Angell Field Track
## 
### 
Preliminary work on Angell Field is
already under way. The field "which
will rival the best tracks in America"
is being built under the direction of
Sam McDonald and Professor Charles
Moser, engineer.
One of the most necessary things that
will be needed for the new track will
be the cinders. It seems that only hard
coal cindcrs are used for this type tif
project, and these are difficult to ob
tain. It may be necessary to go as far -
as Ogdcn, Utah, for the correct type of
cinder. The cinders are usually col
lected at railway division points.
If the cinders are not of the hard coal
variety they are too soft and will not
offer the required spring or proper
draining facilities. Likewise, they will
be turned into powder by the constant I
pounding of the runners on the floor of f
the track.
Angell Field will be used primarily as
a training field although smaller meet.s
and those at which smaller numbers of
spectators are expected will be held
there. When the new bleachers are 1
built it will be possible to seat approxi- j
mately 5.000 spectators.
