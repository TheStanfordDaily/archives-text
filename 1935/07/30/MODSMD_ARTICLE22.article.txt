STANFORD SUCCESS III: Frank
Orr, '35, and Bill Waltman, senior, were
pushing wheel chairs at the San Diego
Fair. Now they are pushing people off
a 123-foot tower at a quarter a push.
Not a handy suicide device, the tower
is the only one of its kind in the world
outside of Russia. Customers are
hauled to the top in an elevator, then
strapped into an already open para
chute. After the push-off by Orr or
Waltman, they drift gently down to
earth (provided nothing goes amiss).
Charlotte Hurridge, also '35, has a job
in the publicity department of Bul
lock's in Los Angeles. And Homer
Ross, '35, has a job with the Southern
California Edison Company. Gordon
David, for 10 years dramatics director
here, is now director in the theatrical
division of the Santa Barbara School of
the Arts.
STORMY WEATHER: Presaging
WAR in Abyssinia, a direct radio tele
graph circuit has just been installed
between Addis Ababa, Ethiopian capi
tol, and London. Thus press stories can
be sent to New York with only one re
lay, that through London. Formerly
traffic from Abyssinia had to clear
through Cairo.
MISCELLANY: Eddie Cantor's re
cent engagement at the Fox Theater in
San Francisco was to try out gags for
his new picture, "Shooting the Chutes."
His daughter, Marjorie, clocked the au
dience reaction to all the gags . . . Can
tor's engagement broke all depression
records for box office grosses in S.F.;
$32,900 was the week's record . . .
Twentieth Century pictures wants to
buy KSFO or KROW for publicity pur
poses . . . The Boswell Sisters have
just concluded a week's engagement in
Glasgow, Scotland . . . The Press-Radio
Bureau goes out of business Thursday
. . .Pinky Tomlin just disced three
new ones for Brunswick.
