If you like -the Dick Powell-Joan
Blondell combination plus a Warner
Bros, musical you can't lose on this.
They seem to have photographed the
Busby Berkley dance creations from
every available angle so they left them
out of this picture.
Adolphe Menjou scores a hit in his
comeback and Louise Faaenda fur
nishes some good laughs.
The presence of the Mills Brothers
makes for real rhythm, and teamed
with Ted Fio Rito's band the com
bination is the tops.
Concerning a gigantic radio hoax that
turns out all right in the end, this ve
hicle seems to prove that the pro
ducers still have faith in the musical
even though most of them have given
up this type of picture.

At 4:30 this afternoon the annual
