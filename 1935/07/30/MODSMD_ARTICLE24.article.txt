# INDIVIDUAL NEWSPAPER CONTROL LESSENS ITS EDUCATIONAL VALUE, SAYS DR. HAND

"The newspaper is the greatest single
educational institution in the world to
day. Yet we have permitted it to re
main in the hands of small groups or
single individuals who may be without
responsibility," said Dr. Harold C.
Hand, professor of education at Stan
ford, in an interview here.
Democracy requires an informed base
and the paper is the most potent agency
in developing this base, according to Dr.
Hand. "We are being short-sighted
when we permit this great force to re
main in the hands of private individ
uals."
Because of this need of the demo
cratic society, he continued, we must
face the fact that adult education is im
perative. It must take a place in the
educational scheme on a basis equal to
other established agencies. We must
Ihink of adult education as a part of
the whole. "It should be as much a
part of our educational system as is
the elementary or the high school,"
Dr. Hand said.
Important in Education
The newspaper is a major factor in
this adult education. Yet, because of
the dominance of certain groups and
individuals it must be regarded as a
miseducative force today, said the pro
fessor. "Newspapermen as a whole
have a high standard of ethics and
resent being under the heel of vested
groups and individuals," he declared!
As a result we find them organizing
guilds for their protection in writing the
truth.
In connection with the paper as an
educative force Dr. Hand explained an
experiment to be undertaken by the
Peoples Foundation of Berkeley. A
paper will be published which will be
owned and controlled by the members
of the association. It will be run on a
non-profit basis with no stock outstand
ing. Some advertising will be carried,
but it will need to pass rather severe
restrictions. It is believed that about
one-eighth of the amount of advertis
ing carried by the ordinary daily will
be sufficient to cover the expenses.

I The paper will represent the inter
| ests of every occupational group of the
: Eastbay district. The editorial staff will
be entirely separate from the business
i management. Such an arrangement will
provide an atmosphere in which news
writers may work free from the dom
; inance of any group. It is hoped that
j the venture will be able to present the
facts regarding present conditions and
become an instrument of great worth
in adult education.
Speaking of the high school, Dr.
Hand stated that the progressive move
ment in secondary education is attempt
ing to organize in a way that will pre
pare students for life here and now.
"We have held the conception that
education must be spelled with a capi
tal "E." We have held that the content
of education should be good for any
time, place, and circumstance," he
said.
As a result we have failed to equip
the students to meet the new problems
they must face in the new society, he
continued. Our present curriculum was
outmoded 30 years ago. We have been
too content to look over our shoulder
into the past. Educators have been
too exclusively concerned with passing
on the racial heritage.
New Methods Needed
"Never again will we have the simple
task of preparing students for a static
society," he said. Until educators rec
ognize the necessity of preparing youth
to enter a changing world, democratic
values are in jeopardy.
The first step in reorienting our
school and our society will involve a
re-educative process for our profession,
according to Dr. Hand. We need to
become students of the social scene.
We need to know the conditions of so
ciety ourselves before we can prepare
students to live under those conditions.
"The public must be made to see
what education ought to be today," Dr.
Hand stated. The older public must
realize that the type of schooling they
received was one fitted for a different
world than that existing today, he said.
