# DR. CARRE TALKS ON HIS TRAVELS THROUGH EGYPT
## Explored Ancient Pyramids As Teacher at Cairo University 
### 
Many unusual aspects of life in Egypt
were revealed by Dr. Jean-Marie Carre
in an illustrated lecture in the Little
Theater Thursday evening.
Resigning his post as visiting profes
sor of French at Middlebury College
during the summer of 1929, Dr. Carre
went to Egypt where he was head of
the French Department at the Royal
University of Cairo until 1933. While
there, Dr. Carre made several trips
around Cairo and into the interior of
Egypt, traveling far up the Nile.
Before his arrival in Egypt, a friend
of Dr. Carre heralded his coming with
the announcement to the Egyptian
newspapers that he was a professor
from the Sorbonne and would be Dean
of the School of Letters at the Royal
University of Cairo. When Dr. Carre
remonstrated with his friend for the
erroneous announcement, the young
man replied,-"Oh, that's all right. Some
day you will be a professor at the
Sorbonne, and also Dean of the School
of Letters here!"
Dr. Carre described the Moham
medan religion, and spoke of one phase
of the yearly festival which requires
the women to dress in long black robes
and not to remove them for an entire
year.
Although he did not climb to the lop
of the pyramids, Dr. Carre explored
their interiors extensively. He also saw
the sphynx as it appeared when com
pletely uncovered from the desert sands
which had concealed it for centuries.
Dr. Carre has written of his travels
throughout Asia, Africa, and America
in his book, "Promenades dans Trots
Continents." This â€¢
Accompanied by Mrs. Carre, Dr.
Carre came to this country to be act
ing professor of Romanic languages at
Stanford this summer.
