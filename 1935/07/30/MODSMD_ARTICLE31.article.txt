# Timely Replies To Old Queries

(This column is intended to answer
questions on campus traditions and
history which might be puzzling to
readers of the Daily. You are, there
fore, urged to phone or write your
questions to the Daily office.)
Q. Why is the Daily termed the
"Dippy"?
A. Until a few years ago, the Stan
ford newspaper was called the "Daily
Palo Alto." Shortening such a title to
"D.P.A.," the paper soon became the
"Dippy."
Q. What is the Cactus Garden?
A. The Cactus Garden is a collection
of rare cacti gathered from all parts of
the country.
Q. Why is Governor's Lane so called?
A. Governor's Lane led from the stock
farm to the Stanford Home in the old
days. The Stanford Home is now the
Stanford Convalescent Home for chil
dren, and the stock farm is mostly a
memory; but the beautiful, eucalyptus
lined drive is still there. In the time of
the Stanfords, the Senator drove down
this lane every fair day in his "red
chariot" and would spend hours watch
ing his favorite horses as they were put
through their paces on the track.
David Starr Jordan was only 40 years
of age when he was chosen President of
Stanford University.
Everyone pooh-poohed and laughed
al the idea of a great university being
established here when it was first
planned to build Stanford.
