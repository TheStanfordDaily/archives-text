# TRAINED COW WILL BE IN HORSE SHOW
## 
### 
A cow in a stock show or a state fair
is nothing unusual, but when a cow is
in a horse show and is a featured ex
hibit, that's news. Such becomes the
case with the announcement of the en
trance of "Minnie the Moo-er," a
trained bovine, in the San Matej)
Counly National Horse Show to be held
August 3 to 10 at the Menlo Circus
Club in Atherton.
"Minnie," who has been raised from
a calf by her young mistress, Miss
Elizabeth Gerrard, has become one of
the daily sights along the roads around
Atherton and will probably be the first
of her kind ever to be invited to enter
a horse show.
Besides drawing a pony cart, Min- '
nie's other achievements include: j
kneeling down, standing and walking on
her hind legs, jumping hurdles, and
drinking from a milk bottle through a '
rubber tube.
Mingling with Minnie, and not at all |
jealous of her presence, will be the i
blue-bloods of the show ring, as fine
an array of show horses as will be
presented on the peninsula this season.
Last year Stanford received over
$1,958,371 as new endowment and $1,-
245,941 in gifts for current expenditure
in research and special projects.
