# San Francisco Museum Exhibits Matisse Works

### 
The San Francisco Museum of Art is
sponsoring an exhibition of African
Negro art which began Friday and
will continue through September 8.
The exhibition is a choice selection from
the show held in March and April at
the Museum-of Modern Art, New York,
augmented by important pieces from
the Ratton Collection lent through the
courtesy of Pierre Matisse of New York.
Sculpture in wood, iron, bronze, cop
per, gold, and ivory, as well as textiles,
implements, and weapons comprise an
exhibition 'of over 225 objects. The
principal emphasis is on sculpture in
wood, which has so much interest for
modern artists. The objects have been
drawn principally from west central
Africa, an area nearly twice the size
of the United States.
