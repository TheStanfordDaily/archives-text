# Lack of Coordination in New Deal Is Observation of Professor Coon
## 
### 
j "I find a lack of co-ordination in the
various phases of the New Deal admin
j istration," said Professor Shirley Jay
i Coon in an interview here today. Pro
| fessor Coon, acting professor of eco
nomics, returned a few weeks ago from
j Washington, where he reports a sur-
I prising lack of co-ordination between
I ihe various governmental departments.
In discussing New Deal measures, he
j added, '"Some of the legislation is good
and some is bad." He pointed out,
however, that many of the measures
are of an experimental nature, and as
' such, their present value cannot be
, truely estimated.
Failure of (he N.R.A.
In discussing the monetary policy,
i Professor Coon said he was "opposed
to meddling with the currency." He
I stated that a return to gold, even
| though not at the old level, would pro
mote in the financial world a much
I needed confidence. He also objects to
i the use of the Federal Reserve System
as an agent for the manipulation of
prices, on the grounds that this body
i should be primarily a banking agent,
and should remain as such, not attempt
ing to extend its powers.
The N R.A., he feels, "was an attempt
to raise ourselves by our boot-straps."
He finds the failure of this measure to
l>e in the attempt to regiment producers
| without regimenting consumers, and in

| the practice nullification of the anti
! trust laws. The latter suspension, he
: states, allowed many large corporations
to do legally what they had been doing
j illegally for some time. He favors a
! more strict enforcement of anti-trust
! legislation.
Government Control
"Some of the agricultural policies of
| the administration," he continued, "do
| attempt to face realistically the facts
[of the present circumstances." We
j either had to export abroad, or curtail
j domestic production. Increased exports
I involve on increased importation of for
: eign goods, and we were not willing to
accept this method. Therefore, the only
i way to aid the farm group was to re
duce producing acreage."
"Government spending," he asserted,
"can be justified to a certain extent,
but the administration should look
toward balancing the budget. There
has not been even a long-term balance
plan advanced as yet."
"Government control," he concluded,
"will continue." He expects that many
more industries, such as coal and oil,
! will eventually be declared public utili
j ties.

School of Business Administration at
i the University of Montana, has held the
I postion ofi Dean of the College of Eco

j "I find a lack of co-ordination in the

j Washington, where he reports a sur-
I prising lack of co-ordination between
I ihe various governmental departments.
In discussing New Deal measures, he
j added, '"Some of the legislation is good
and some is bad." He pointed out,
however, that many of the measures
are of an experimental nature, and as
' such, their present value cannot be
, truely estimated.
Failure of (he N.R.A.
In discussing the monetary policy,
i Professor Coon said he was "opposed
to meddling with the currency." He
I stated that a return to gold, even
| though not at the old level, would pro
mote in the financial world a much
I needed confidence. He also objects to
i the use of the Federal Reserve System
as an agent for the manipulation of
prices, on the grounds that this body
i should be primarily a banking agent,
and should remain as such, not attempt
ing to extend its powers.
The N R.A., he feels, "was an attempt
to raise ourselves by our boot-straps."
He finds the failure of this measure to
l>e in the attempt to regiment producers
| without regimenting consumers, and in

| the practice nullification of the anti
! trust laws. The latter suspension, he
: states, allowed many large corporations
to do legally what they had been doing
j illegally for some time. He favors a
! more strict enforcement of anti-trust
! legislation.
Government Control
"Some of the agricultural policies of
| the administration," he continued, "do
| attempt to face realistically the facts
[of the present circumstances." We
j either had to export abroad, or curtail
j domestic production. Increased exports
I involve on increased importation of for
: eign goods, and we were not willing to
accept this method. Therefore, the only
