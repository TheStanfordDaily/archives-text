It wasn't an air attack on Stanford
that was heard yesterday morning, but
it certainly seemed like one.
Seventeen big battleplanes looped,
zoomed, and whirled in the sky above
the campus, but as they were only on
a sight-seeing trip no damage resulted.
The planes were from Sunnyvale,
where four squadrons of them from
the S.S. Saratoga arc quartered in the
hangar of the ill-fated dirigible "Ma
con." They will be there until Friday.
After they return to the Saratoga,
four more squadrons will be sent to
Sunnyvale from the S.S. Lexington.
It is rumored that a large force of
planes will be permanently established
in the "Macon's" old hangar. by the
Navy Department.
Two more airplane carriers, the
\ orktown and the Enterprise, are now
being built by the Navy at Yorktown,
Virginia, and will in all probability be
sent to California. This will overcrowd
(he San Diego base, and Sunnyvale is
being considered as an additional sta
tion.
The flyers, on their return to Sun
nyvale yesterday, expressed enthusiasm
for the beauties of Stanford University
as viewed from the air.
"No adequate idea of it can be had
from the ground," one of them de
clared. "You have to see the lawns
and buildings from above to get an j
idea of their extent. The quadrangle j
is particularly attractive when viewed '
in this manner. It looks like an old j
Spanish mission."
