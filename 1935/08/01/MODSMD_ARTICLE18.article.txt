# Aids Convalescent Home
## 
### 
Stanford has a vested interest in the coining Horse Show at llie
Menlo Circus Club in Atherton. The proceeds of the show are to
go to the Stanford Convalescent Home, a charity institution main
tained on the campus to care for underprivileged children. During
the entire year the Convalescent Home gives free medical aid and
builds back to health 150 children.
To support this worthy cause financially the Stanford Aux
iliary was formed. The work of this organization coupled with the
efforts <>l various campus groups manages to raise sufficient funds
yearly to enable the Home to carry on its work.
The individual student can do his share toward helping the
Home in continuing its charity by going to the Horse Show. It's
well worth seeing, and at the same time a service will be rendered
in donating toward the support of some needy child.â€”R. G. S.
