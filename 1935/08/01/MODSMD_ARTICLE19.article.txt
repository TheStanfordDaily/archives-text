# In with the New

The modification of the old rule of the "500" has brought with
it a change in the curriculum at Stanford. Stanford now has not
only professional schools of medicine, law, and engineering, but
has added many cultural courses.
The schools of art and music have been extended, and courses
in Shakespeare and art appreciation are offered this summer. The
exhibition opening today at the Stanford Art Gallery is character
istic of the new role Stanford is assuming.â€”IJ. I*\
