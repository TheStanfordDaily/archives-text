# Residence Is Considered By Spanish Department
## 
### 
Ihe possibility of a Spanish house
on the campus next year is being con
sidered by the Spanish department.
There would be no requirements for
residence in the house save a fair
command of the language and a will
ingness to co-operate in its use through
out the period spent there.
Any persons who would be interested
in suÂ«h an arrangement are asked to
get in touch with Stuart M. Gross,
teaching assistant in Spanish.
Such houses are not uncommon on
other campuses throughout the country
and a German house for girls has also
been planned for Stanford next year.
