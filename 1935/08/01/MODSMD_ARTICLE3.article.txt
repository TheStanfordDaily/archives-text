# California Only State to Support Adult Education, States MacKaye
## 
### 
California leads the world in adult
education," D. L. MacKaye, director of
the department of adult education at
San Jose, said here yesterday.
The adult program is part of the pub
lic school and functions as a part of
the secondary system, according to Mr.
MacKaye. He said that the program
was first started to assist the foreign
groups to become Americanized.
"Since 1926, however, adult educa
tion has been conducted on the prem
ise that the continuation of learning
is essential to the political stability
of this country," Mr. MacKaye as
serted.
San Jose Schools
In describing the work being carried
on at San Jose, he reported an average
attendance of 3,000. Four or five cen
ters are provided in the city for the
work. The program still provides edu
cation for the foreign population; al
though the cultural development of the
lay citizenry is emphasized. He brought
out of the fact that the high school

buildings seemed to over-awe some of
the foreign groups, making it necessary
to provide other meeting places.
Ordinarily about 1,500 adults are en
rolled in the discussion groups, Mr.
MacKaye said. These groups discuss
matters which are considered to be on
a college level although different meth
ods of instruction are employed.
Since almost all the students in Mr.
! MacKaye's school are employed, no
J outside readings can be assigned. All
i the work must be done within the two
hour period of attendance. #
Subjects Lasted
The contents of the course are se
| lected on the basis of their relation to
the immediate scene. Some of the sub
jects on the program are economics,
social and political science, and psy
| chology. Mr. MacKaye mentioned that
|in psychology, domestic relationships
j and child studies are emphasized, an
J example of the way in which the school
attempts to make its subjects practical
to the student.
"Theoretically, adult education is a
tremendous force in our society," he
said. Actually, he continued, the adult
program fails because of the limited i
number of districts which have made
adult education available. He declared
that the practice of teaching vocational
subjects, such as sewing, was easy but i
failed to make the program one of so- j
cial value.
Lack of Teachers
The program is handicapped by a
lack of teachers trained to do this par
ticular type of work. He said, however,
that the school is not forced to use pro- i
fessional teachers. Any specialist who j
can meet certain credential require- I
ments may contribute his knowledge j
in the adult education program.
"Unquestionably the United States J
government will subsidize adult educa- j
tion," Mr. MacKaye concluded, show- !
ing that the $26,000,000 in federal aid j
to the adult program last year was the j
only major contribution of the federal
government to the schools. .

ticular type of work. He said, however,
that the school is not forced to use pro- i
fessional teachers. Any specialist who j
can meet certain credential require- I
ments may contribute his knowledge j
in the adult education program.
"Unquestionably the United States J
government will subsidize adult educa- j
tion," Mr. MacKaye concluded, show- !
ing that the $26,000,000 in federal aid j
to the adult program last year was the j
only major contribution of the federal
government to the schools. .
California leads the world in adult
education," D. L. MacKaye, director of
the department of adult education at
San Jose, said here yesterday.
The adult program is part of the pub
lic school and functions as a part of
the secondary system, according to Mr.
MacKaye. He said that the program
was first started to assist the foreign
groups to become Americanized.
"Since 1926, however, adult educa
tion has been conducted on the prem
ise that the continuation of learning
is essential to the political stability
of this country," Mr. MacKaye as
serted.
San Jose Schools
In describing the work being carried
on at San Jose, he reported an average
attendance of 3,000. Four or five cen
ters are provided in the city for the
work. The program still provides edu
cation for the foreign population; al
though the cultural development of the
lay citizenry is emphasized. He brought
out of the fact that the high school

buildings seemed to over-awe some of
the foreign groups, making it necessary
to provide other meeting places.
Ordinarily about 1,500 adults are en
rolled in the discussion groups, Mr.
MacKaye said. These groups discuss
matters which are considered to be on
a college level although different meth
ods of instruction are employed.
Since almost all the students in Mr.
! MacKaye's school are employed, no
J outside readings can be assigned. All
i the work must be done within the two
hour period of attendance. #
Subjects Lasted
The contents of the course are se
| lected on the basis of their relation to
the immediate scene. Some of the sub
jects on the program are economics,
social and political science, and psy
| chology. Mr. MacKaye mentioned that
|in psychology, domestic relationships
j and child studies are emphasized, an
J example of the way in which the school
attempts to make its subjects practical
to the student.
"Theoretically, adult education is a
tremendous force in our society," he
said. Actually, he continued, the adult
program fails because of the limited i
number of districts which have made
adult education available. He declared
that the practice of teaching vocational
subjects, such as sewing, was easy but i
failed to make the program one of so- j
cial value.
Lack of Teachers
The program is handicapped by a
lack of teachers trained to do this par
ticular type of work. He said, however,
that the school is not forced to use pro- i
fessional teachers. Any specialist who j
can meet certain credential require- I
ments may contribute his knowledge j
in the adult education program.
