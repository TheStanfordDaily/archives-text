# FUTURE WRITERS TO SEEK BEAUTY, SAYS OLDFATHER
## Style Will Follow Classics In New Trend Away From Realism 
### 
Writers of the future will pattern
their style on ancient Greek and Roman
authors rather than on the authors of
today.
This assertion was made yesterday
by Professor W. A. Oldfather, acting
professor of classical, literature and au
thor of many monographs on classical
.subjects.
"Modern literature has just about
reached the limit of its development
along the lines of loose, careless writ
ing," explained Professor Oldfather.
"Further progress can be made only by
placing emphasis on form and style."
Modern Writers
Modern writers, he pointed out, are
mainly concerned with a spontaneous
self expression. Most of them write in
the language of ordinary conversation.
They complain that a formal and or
dered style interferes with realism and
that the careless style is more efficient,
but our age is coming more and more
to demand beauty and craftsmanship.
We are no longer satisfied with mere
efficiency even in material things.
"The automobile is ai\ example of
this growing demand for style and
form," Professor Oldfather declared.
"The cars of the past were crude and
ugly. They were designed exclusively
for utility. But such vehicles no longer
satisfy us. Modern automobile manu
facturers are shaping their products
along lines of grace and beauty as well
as efficiency. They have learned that
a car does not have to be ugly in order
to be useful. When such a typical
manufacturer as Henry Ford finally
goes in for style, that must make it
just about unanimous."
Demand for Beauty
Literature also will have to conform
to the new demand for beauty, the pro
lessor declared. It can best perfect it
self, he continued, by taking as ex
amples the writers of ancient times
who studied form and style before they
attempted to write. By doing so, they
achieved a clarity and compactness that j
is rarely equalled today.
"Not all classical authors, of course,"
Professor Oldfather said, "obtained this
clarity and compactness. The second
rate writers of those times were too
much concerned with mere rhetoric, j
They sacrificed subject matter in order
to obtain mere beauty of words. But it |
is not necessary to do this. The im
portant writers of classical times were ]
able to say far more in fewer words
than our writers of today."
Concentrated Thought
This concentration of thought was
the result of constant study and prac
tice, Professor Oldfather believes. No
ancient writer ever regarded his style
as perfect but was constantly trying to
improve it. Literary studies were not
confined to schoolrooms but were con
tinued throughout a man's life. It was
not uncommon, he said, for Greek and
Roman men in their forties to retain
private tutors to aid them in their spe
cialties. This continuous cultivating of
natural talent has no counterpart
among modern authors.
"Another virtue of the classical sys
tem," Professor Oldfather said, "is that
the practice of writing was not confined
to a few. All men wanted to write well
if they wrote at all, and ordinary cor
respondence was conducted in a style
that many professional writers of today
might envy." -
