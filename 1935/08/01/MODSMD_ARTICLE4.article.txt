# Firehouse Pets Riot As Cats Eat Gopher
## 
### 
Bob Savage, keeper of the Fire
house Zoo, recently lost his job as
animal trainer because he has no
animals to train. A few weeks ago
the firemen returned from burning
grass in Jordan Park, bringing with
them the beginnings of a varied col
lection of native fauna.
A baby 'possum, a gopher snake, a
king snake, and two very small kit
tens started what Savage visualized
as some day being the finest unofficial
collection of animals on the campus.
A few days later misfortune came
to the Firehouse and Savage's dumb,
but evidently unhappy friends, all
left in a hurry. "I guess they didn't
like me as much as I liked them,"
said Savage.
Anyhow, none of the new arrivals
got along very well together. The
gopher bit the gopher snake and then
left with the snake in close pursuit.
When the gopher returned, without
the snake, the hungry kittens ate
him. The 'possum went back to Jor
dan Park with his friend, the king
snake, because they were lonely when
Savage was too busy polishing brass
to play with them.
