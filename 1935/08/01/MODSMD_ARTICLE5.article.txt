## 
### 
Telling his audience that the spirit
of Italy was "everything for Italy, noth
ing against Italy, and everything in
Italy," George E. Stone addressed a
group of 150 in the Assembly Hall
Tuesday night. Illustrating his lecture,
"The Spirit of Italy," with numerous
colored slides, he took the audience
through the major art galleries of the
principal cities of Italy. Rare objects
of art and quaint old world scenes
comprised the largest part of his il
lustrative material.
Discussing both the old and new
spirit of Italy, Mr. Stone told his listen
ers that Mussolini is to be admired for
his work and for the spirit and na
tional pride with which he has endowed
the people of Italy.
Mr. Stone, head of the department of
photography (visual education) at the
San Jose State Teachers College, was
introduced by Professor Percy A. Mar
tin of the history department at Stan
ford.
