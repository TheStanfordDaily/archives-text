# KOENIG LECTURES ON TUDOR SCIENCE
## 
### 
"Harvey was sure by 1616 that he had
discovered blood circulation, but he did
not publish his discovery until 1628,"
averred Dr. Frederick Otto Koenig,
instructor in chemistry, last night in
the Tudor lecture.
Harvey lived from 1578 to 1657, and
his discovery stimulated the study of
anatomy in the following century.
Dr. Koenig went on to discuss the
relations between Tudor science on the
one hand and the life and literature on
the other.
"In chemistry, scientists were follow
ers of Paracalcus and devoted them
selves to gathering facts slowly, but
there was not much progress in actual
knowledge and ideas until about 1660,"
he continued. "There was, however,
very great progress in physics and
astronomy."
Dr. Koenig's talk was the sixth in the
series of Tudor lectures being presented
in connection with the course in Shake
spearean production given at Stanford
this summer. The lectures, held in the
Women's Clubhouse, begin promptly at
7:30 o'clock each Wednesday.
