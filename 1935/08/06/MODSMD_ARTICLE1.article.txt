# Dictatorship Predicted As Cause of War
## European Conditions Critical, Says Dr. Ralph Lutz In KGO Talk National Policies Threaten Present Status Quo 
### 
For the first time since 1918 Europe
is worrying about who will be respon
sible for the next war, not who caused
the catastrophe of 1914," Dr. Ralph
Haswell Lutz of Stanford said last
night in a radio talk on "The New
European Crisis" over KGO.
National policies for expansion, na
tionalization, security, and colonization,
may lead to an international war, Dr.
Lutz, who is professor of history and
dean of graduate study, said.
"The prevention of international
war," he continued, "demands sacri
fices by those who would preserve
peace, and the present crisis reveals
I hat Europe is not prepared to make
the sacrifice."
Status Quo Threatened
Four of the world's powers, Russia,
Japan, Italy, and Germany, have since
1918, at least, considered policies which
seem to threaten the status quo, Dr.
Lutz declared. "It is a safe prediction
that if another European war breaks
out, it will be precipitated not by a
democratic power but by a dictator
ship."
Of the European dictatorships, he
continued, Germany has the greatest
chance of winning allies for a war
based upon "legitimate territorial
claims." Her national leader, Hitler,
has "greater power and prestige than
William II ever possessed." His foreign
policy indicates the possibility of
armed expansion unless the claims of
Germany are recognized.
A revision of the territorial clauses
of the Versailles treaty will involve
France, "the greatest, military, political,
and economic power on the European
continent," Dr. Lutz asserted. Her post
war treaties have been strengthened
by an alliance with Russia and rap
prochements with England and Italy.
Italy's Condition Prccarious
Italy, according to Dr. Lutz, is in a
precarious condition. While the real
policy of Mussolini, in face of the oppo
sition of the league, is still somewhat
obscure, he will probably attempt to
carry out toward Ethiopia "the well
known European plan of a penetration
pacifique, which in plain language
means the conquest of a backward peo
ple by an imperialist power."
Dr. Lutz said that one can see in
Europe's return to the pre-war system
of militarism, secret alliances and im
perialism the certain sign that inter
national war is again regarded by the
great as a "mere continuation of policy
by other means."

A revision of the territorial clauses
of the Versailles treaty will involve
France, "the greatest, military, political,
and economic power on the European
continent," Dr. Lutz asserted. Her post
war treaties have been strengthened
by an alliance with Russia and rap
prochements with England and Italy.
Italy's Condition Prccarious
Italy, according to Dr. Lutz, is in a
precarious condition. While the real
policy of Mussolini, in face of the oppo
sition of the league, is still somewhat
obscure, he will probably attempt to
carry out toward Ethiopia "the well
known European plan of a penetration
pacifique, which in plain language
means the conquest of a backward peo
ple by an imperialist power."
Dr. Lutz said that one can see in
Europe's return to the pre-war system
of militarism, secret alliances and im
perialism the certain sign that inter
national war is again regarded by the
great as a "mere continuation of policy
by other means."
For the first time since 1918 Europe
is worrying about who will be respon
sible for the next war, not who caused
the catastrophe of 1914," Dr. Ralph
Haswell Lutz of Stanford said last
night in a radio talk on "The New
European Crisis" over KGO.
National policies for expansion, na
tionalization, security, and colonization,
may lead to an international war, Dr.
Lutz, who is professor of history and
dean of graduate study, said.
"The prevention of international
war," he continued, "demands sacri
fices by those who would preserve
peace, and the present crisis reveals
I hat Europe is not prepared to make
the sacrifice."
Status Quo Threatened
Four of the world's powers, Russia,
Japan, Italy, and Germany, have since
1918, at least, considered policies which
seem to threaten the status quo, Dr.
Lutz declared. "It is a safe prediction
that if another European war breaks
out, it will be precipitated not by a
democratic power but by a dictator
ship."
Of the European dictatorships, he
continued, Germany has the greatest
chance of winning allies for a war
based upon "legitimate territorial
claims." Her national leader, Hitler,
has "greater power and prestige than
William II ever possessed." His foreign
policy indicates the possibility of
armed expansion unless the claims of
Germany are recognized.
