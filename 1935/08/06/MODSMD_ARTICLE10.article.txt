## 
### 
Two thousand people have viewed
j the European exhibition of paintings
j and water colors in the Art Gallery
! over a period of four days. This rec-
I ord attendance is due to the merit of
! the art to be seen in the display.
Two lectures have been given in the
1 gallery by Professor Edward M. Farmer
j and Daniel M. Mendelowitz of the
j graphic arts division. Mr. Farmer's
| lecture was given primarily for his
I class, but many of the visitors to the
Art Gallery attended.
The gallex'y was full at the time of
j the lecture, and although the closing
j hour is 5 o'clock, the visitors and class
| were allowed to stay until the conclu-
I sion of the talk, 40 minutes later.
Visitors from Oxford University,
i England, and from many states have
I enjoyed the exhibition. The British
I visitors also praised the beauty of the
j Stanford University grounds.
The most famous painting in the col-
I lection is the "Man with the Hoe" by
Jean Francois Millet. Most of the
j Americans who view the exhibition are
! pleased with the "Portrait of Captain
| Clayton Merriweather Talbot" by Gil
l bert Stuart, while students of modern
I art are charmed with "Pastel" by Jules
| Pascin. Manet's "Grand Canal, Ven
| ice" is also very popular.
This exhibition, valued at $1,000,000.
j is held in conjunction with the course
i in art appreciation being presented at
| Stanford this summer, and is intended
i for the- average visitor rather than for
' the specialist in art. The Art Gallery
i is open from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., and no
j admission is charged. Attendants will
| give information to those who desire it.
