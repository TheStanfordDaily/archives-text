# Higher Grades Are Made By Younger Pupils

"We are convinced that the younger !
student does as well, if not better, in
studies than the older one. He is ahead
of the game when he comes to Stanford
and usually keeps that place," declared
Charles Gilbert Wrenn, assistant regis
trar at Stanford.
"Our subjective study here at the
University," he continued, "has con
firmed the conclusions of other studies
on the scholastic accomplishments of !
younger college students."
In a series of investigations recently
reported by Professor Noel Keys of the
University of California, it was indi
cated that "under age" students in
high schools and universities earn more
scholastic honors, get placed on the j
football team more often, and have bet
ter chances of marrying than their
older classmates.
In this study, the difference between
the young and normal age groups were ;
particularly marked with respect to
length of stay in college and prospects (
of marriage.
Professor Keys claims: "There is ev
ery indication that the policy of rapid
promotion could be employed much
more widely and at the same time more
wisely than at present."
In an effort to facilitate the adjust- j
ment of all new students, the registrar's i
office has assigned many seniors as
guides and friends to the new trans
fers while they are "learning the ropes" !
at Stanford.
By letters, bulletins, and a pre
registration meeting, the administration
hopes to help Stanford's new fall stu- (
dents to make a better adjustment.
