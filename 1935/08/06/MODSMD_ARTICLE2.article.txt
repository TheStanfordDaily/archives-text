# Old Union Gets Elevator For Carrying Ice Cream
## 
### 
For the past week the gjrls in the
Union living group have been speculat
ing on just what caused the noise out
side their window. At last, the source
of the racket was found to be a group
of workmen with pneumatic hammers
tearing out the base of the Old Union
to make way for the installation of a
service elevator.
The new elevator is being installed at
the cost of $1,100 and will facilitate the
transporting of ice and ice cream
through the 10-foot rise between the
kitchens.
