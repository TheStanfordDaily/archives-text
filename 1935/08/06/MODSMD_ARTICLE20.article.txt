It is true ttyit the university can very often give the student the
basic theories and fundamentals of his elected occupation, but it is

tice and knowledge of how to gain material things.

means of his becoming wealthy is likely to be deceived. He will
probably find he knows very little and that his practical educa
tion is just starting with commencement.
In these changing times when no one knows exactly what is
going to happen next, probably the greatest thing we can expect to
receive from our education is a more healthy attitude, by which we
may find happiness with or without money.— K. B.
