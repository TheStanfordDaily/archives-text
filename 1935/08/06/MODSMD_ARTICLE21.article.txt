llow many of us can honestly say we know the campus? If we
expect to take much more than the minimum share of benefits from
the University when we graduate, we must know more than the
average undergraduate knows about his own school.
How many of us have felt rather stupid when our mental picture
of the campus was so ha/.v we were unable to tell the tourist how to
get to the Mausoleum?
The student who thinks Biblical history is taught by vestry and
v»ho wonders what is so interesting about the ('.actus Gardens and
the Sand Hill Road should gel to know the campus. The student
who sees little more than a few buildings, and even then is careful
to stay away from the Museum and Art Gallery, is not gelling all he
should from Stanford.
Also, a little historical background is really harmless and might
help us to appear as if we knew something about Stanford. —E. B.
