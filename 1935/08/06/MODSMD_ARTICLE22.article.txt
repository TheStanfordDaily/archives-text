Stanford assumes a cosmopolitan atmosphere during these vaca
tion months. The campus has become a mecca for tourists from
all parts of the nation.
Almost any day one can see automobile license plates from
widely separated states on cars parked in front of the Adminis
tration Building. At one time this writer saw New Jersey, Hhode
Island, Texas, and Massachusetts represented in a group of four
cars.
An unprecedented number of Atlantic Coast slates have been
represented in this fashion. New York, Pennsylvania, and Massa
chusetts predominating. Midwestern license plates, mainly Illinois,
Nebraska, and lowa, are quite common. Plates from Georgia and
North Carolina have been seen.
The same representation of states is confirmed by the student
guide service. Visitors from as far as Australia and the Orient have
been here, and there are a great number of New England and East
ern sightseers.â€”l). B.
