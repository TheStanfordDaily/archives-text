# Good Will Visitors
## 
### 
When Ihe .">2 "Good Will" students sent by Japan to the United
Stiites arrive at Stanford on August 18, every one of ns should
make it his personal responsibility to see that they enjoy themselves.
The visit of these young Nipponese men and women is far more
than a mere sightseeing tour. It is a gesture of intellectual com
radeship between East and West. At a time when war clouds hang
heavy over a troubled world, gestures of international amity have
far-reaching significance.
The I'nited States does not want war, either with Japan or with
any other country. A hysterical press sponsored by professional
trouble-makers would have ns believe that war with Japan is very
near. The good will tour gives the lie to this slander.
Hv making the stay of these students at Stanford as enjoyable
u% possible we shall do much to demonstrate to Japan that Ihc
voting men and young women of this generation do not intend to
repeat the mistakes of the past.â€” C. Y.
