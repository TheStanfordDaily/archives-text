MOST DANCE LEADERS turn from -
jazz to the classics for day-off musical 1
relaxation. Ted Fio-Rito's favorite is i
Chaikovsky's "Pathetique" symphony; J
Jack Shilkret and Howard Barlow do
a brother act over "Tristan und Isolde": ,
Andre Kostelanetz, also , a Wagner fan, j
prefers "The Dusk of the Gods" from
"Gotterdammerung"; Freddie Rich
turns from the lively rhythms of jazz
to Richard Strauss' "Death and Trans- j
figuration"; Jan Savitt and Johnny
Green like Beethoven's Fifth Sym- j
phony, Raymond Paige, Brahm's Firsl; j
while Richard Himbcr turns from his
own smooth rhythms to those of the !
"Meditation" from "Thais."
PICK-UPS: When Jack Benny re- '
turns to the air in the fall, he will be ■
minus Don Bestor and Frank Parker, j
Among those being considered to re- |
place Bestor are Jimmy Grier, Jack '
Joy, # and Orville Knapp. The latter, !
however, will probably be prevented j
from taking the job by his contract to j
replace Wayne King at a Chicago ball
room, which King leaves after a five- ;
year engagement . . . The pictures are
casting goo-goo eyes at Eddie Duchin j
. . . Torch-singing Libby llolman will
star in a Coast production of "Any- ;
I thing Goes" . . . Tommy Lee turned !
down a reputed offer of $2,000,000 from i
William Randolph Hearst for the Don j
Lee Network. Not for sale at any price, I
said Tommy . . . Minsky's famous New -
York burlesque will go a 10-weeks' j
engagement at S.F.'s Columbia The- i
ater in the fall.
AROUND THE DIAL: A new nation- j
wide series of light-classic musicals
directed by Meredith Willson debuts on
j KPO at 9 tonight . . . Joe Venuti, one
of the top bands in jazzdom, brings his
torrid rhythms to KPO tomorrow night
at 6.
TIP TO ROBLE: Page Gilman, '37,
has but one requisite necessary to all
his women, according to an NBC press
release. Blonds, brunettes, or red
heads—it doesn't matter as long as they
j have small feet.

MOST DANCE LEADERS turn from -
jazz to the classics for day-off musical 1
relaxation. Ted Fio-Rito's favorite is i
Chaikovsky's "Pathetique" symphony; J
Jack Shilkret and Howard Barlow do
a brother act over "Tristan und Isolde": ,
Andre Kostelanetz, also , a Wagner fan, j
prefers "The Dusk of the Gods" from
"Gotterdammerung"; Freddie Rich
turns from the lively rhythms of jazz
to Richard Strauss' "Death and Trans- j
figuration"; Jan Savitt and Johnny
Green like Beethoven's Fifth Sym- j
phony, Raymond Paige, Brahm's Firsl; j
while Richard Himbcr turns from his
own smooth rhythms to those of the !
"Meditation" from "Thais."
PICK-UPS: When Jack Benny re- '
turns to the air in the fall, he will be ■
minus Don Bestor and Frank Parker, j
Among those being considered to re- |
place Bestor are Jimmy Grier, Jack '
Joy, # and Orville Knapp. The latter, !
however, will probably be prevented j
from taking the job by his contract to j
replace Wayne King at a Chicago ball
room, which King leaves after a five- ;
year engagement . . . The pictures are
casting goo-goo eyes at Eddie Duchin j
