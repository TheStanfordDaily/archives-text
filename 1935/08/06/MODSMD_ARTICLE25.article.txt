# PROFESSOR CARRE TELLS OF EUROPE

### 
The United States is one of the few 1
countries whose beauty spots are avail- {
able to rich and poor alike, according to
Professor Jean-Marie Carre, visiting
professor of Romanic languages. He !
was amazed to find our national parks |
offering camping facilities to poorer
tourists.
Such is not the case in Europe, he i
explained. In the majority of European
beauty spots there are only expensive
hotels to serve tourists, and only the
wealthy can afford to patronize them.
Transportation is another barrier, ac
cording to Professor Carre. The poorer
classes of Europe do not own automo- j
biles as do poorer Americans, and they j
are forced to pay railroad fares when j
they travel. But the American tourist, j
with his cheap automobile and his j
camping equipment, can go anywhere >
at very low cost.
Professor Carre recently returned j
from a trip to Yosemite Valley. He was j
much impressed with what he saw, de- i
claring that the scenery equalled in j
beauty that of the Swiss Alps.
The Stanford School of Nursing is |
one of the two institutions of its kind I
on the Pacific Coast.
