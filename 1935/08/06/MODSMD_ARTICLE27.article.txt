# CAUSES OF ITALO-ETHIOP CRISIS TRACED TO 1896 MASSACRE, WORLD WAR TREATIES

(This is the first of three articles
tracing the background of the tense
situation in Ethiopia.â€”The Editor.)
At the time the European powers
were having their great race to estab
lish empires in Africp during the late
nineteenth century, Italy began to stake
out claims along the Red Sea and In
dian Ocean. This was in the '80's and
marks the beginning of the Ethiopian
.situation.
At this time the ambitious Italians
had established enclaves in Eritrea
and Somaliland. However, partly to
satisfy public opinion due to the mas
sacre of Italian explorers in that part
of Africa and partly to take advantage
of Great Britain's friendliness, the
Italian government dispatched an ex
pedition in 1885 to occupy Massawa
and Beilul and subsequently to extend
their zone of occupation.
Italians Defeated
This action excited Jubu, the negus
of Ethiopia, and soon the Abyssinians
opened hostilities despite Italy's at
tempt to reassure them. On January 25.
1887, the Africans attacked Saoti only
to be repulsed; but on the following
day, 20,000 strong, they defeated an
Italian force near Dungali. In this en
counter the Italians under General De
Cristoforis were overwhelmed and de
stroyed where they stood. Dead and
wounded alike were mutilated by order
of the Ras of the Tigre.
After this the internal situation in
Abyssinia became worse, due to the

j wars of succession after the death of
' Jubu. However, Italy, because of a de
i cidedly embittered public opinion over
the recent massacre, dispatched re
! inforcements to the African region. At
j this time the British urged mediation
j but the Italians flatly refused.
Native troops under Menelik, negus
J after the wars of succession, with the
advice and aid of the French, again
disastrously defeated the Italians at
j Adowa in 189G, and thus ended Italian
| imperialistic aims in Africa for the time
being.
Foreign Minister Overthrown
This repulse, the only one received by
j and imperialistic nation by natives in
j Africa caused the overthrow of Crispi,
j the Italian foreign minister at Rome,
j Italy was left with two secondary en
j claves as her only foothold in Africa.
This repulse was soothing to both the
i French and the English, but it re
! mained a decided thorn in the side of
! the Italians.
j In 1908, however, a tripartite agree
j ment was made between France, Eng
land, and Italy which guaranteed the
integrity and independence of Ethiopia.
This eliminated the prospect of con
quest by any of the three competitors.
The repulse of the Italians in 189G is
one of the causes which lies back of
the present Italian movement in Ethi
opia. Along with this Italy was not
pleased with the World War settle
j ments, for she feels she did not receive
her share in the redistribution of co
| lonial possessions.
