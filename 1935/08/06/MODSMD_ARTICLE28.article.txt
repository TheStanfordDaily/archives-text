THORNHILL DROPS
I KOM CONTEST

Coach Tiny Thornhill withdrew from
the all-star coach contest in order to
throw his support to Coach Slip Madi
gan,
Mr. Thornhill polled over three
quarters of a million votes, which was
not enough to place him on the top of
the list of candidates but enough to
indicate the growing popularity of the
Stanford mentor.
An enormous number of ballots was
received on the last day of the contest
and the winner will not be announced
until the votes have been tabulated.

MANY TROPHIES IN
MEN'S (IYM

Faded and torn, with peeling gilt
letters, is the silk banner which hangs
in the campus trophy room. The first
trophy awarded to Stanford, it was pre
sented by Mrs. Leland Stanford in 1892.
In contrast to this relic is the latest
Irophy, the polished triangular shaped
cup awarded to Bones Hamilton as the
most valuable football player in Amer
ica last season.
These are only two of many coveted
awards crammed together in a room in
the*men's gymnasium.
Not being permitted in the men's
gym, few women have ever seen these
irophies, and many men students have
not taken the opportunity to step into
the award room and see these records
of Stanford's past athletic success.
