# UNIVERSITY ON WHEELS 450 People in Busses VISIT CAMPUS ON TOUR
## 
### 
Arriving in big motor busses, 450
men and women stepped out onto the
Quadrangle to inspect the University
last week. They were seeing the West
as members of a college on wheels.
The University of Tours is sponsored
by the Southwestern Teachers College
of Atlanta, Georgia. Its members are
students and teachers from almosl
every college in the East. The tour is
accredited, and classes are conducted
each day by special instructors and
lecturers. It moves in three sections of
five busses each. Stops are made at
every important point and lectures are
given.
Enthusiasm was expressed by the
visitors over the beauties of Stanford.
"It is the most famous of western col
leges," Professor David M. Trout, of
the University of Chicago, declared.
"Everyone in the East has heard of it
and wants to see it. My particular en
thusiasm is for the Chapel, which is
the most beautiful I have ever seen."
According to Brewer, one of the bus
drivers, the tour is a non-profit or
ganization. Each member pays about
$200 and receives transportation, food,
and sleeping quarters for the entire
trip. The University assembled at Chi
cago and left there June 27.
After leaving Stanford the group will
proceed to Yosemite Valley, then down
the coast to Los Angeles. They will dis
band in Texas August 21.
