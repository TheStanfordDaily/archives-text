I The Editor, Sir:
When a Californian asks an easterner
how he likes this state he usually smiles
first because he knows the answer will
be "yes." Well, I've been here a year
! and the answer is still "yes," but I
would like to remind Californians that
perhaps not everyone in the world lives
somewhere else only because of ex
treme poverty or abysmal ignorance of
what they are missing.
In no other state I've visited have I
found the natives so intolerant of other
places. Forgotten is that old truth that
: almost any place where one has real
friends and not too many hardships be
comes a real home. The prairies, and
even the deserts are loved by many of
; those people at whom we gaze with
sentimental pity as we speed by at 60
miles per hour.
It is really impossible to compare
different localities, especially in the
way Californians are prone to try: by
j making flying visits and trying to set
! up each little locality against the fa
•miliar scenes of a magnificent state
j with its thousand-mile coast line.
I come from New England, and the
| two coasts are so different that no one
should try to weigh their respective
advantages. I like them both equally
well, but I am afraid we New Engend
ers will very shortly have to relinquish
to you Californians our long-held ap
pellation, "dyed in the wool."
Sincerely,
W.B.
