# SEA LIFE STUDIED IN MONTEREY BAY
## 
### 
i Down the coast in Monterey Bay is
' a small group of Stanford students
| about which little is heard. Known to
j the outside world as the Hopkins Mar
; ine Station, this distant department of
; the University provides facilities for
i the study of experimental biology, mor
; phology, marine biology, and oceanol-
I ogy.
With 12 faculty members and 21 stu
j dents this group spends its working
[ hours studying the various marine life
j that so plentifully abounds in this re
! gion.
Founded in 1892 by Timothy Hop
kins, David Starr Jordan, Charles Hen
ry Gilbert, and Oliver Peebles Jenkins,
the station has continued to flourish
and has proven itself a valuable asset
to the biology department.
The guest professor at Hopkins Ma
i rine Station this summer is Dr. Paul L.
Kirk, of the University of California.
Dr. Kirk is well known for the re
markable work that he has performed
jin the field of microanalysis. By means
of his exacting analysis under a micro
scope of minute particles, Dr. Kirk has
I aided the Berkeley police department
j in the solving of a number of famous
j crimes. During the summer Dr. Kirk Is
j giving a series of lectures on micro
| chemical methods in biology.
The course of study at th<? station
I consists of both laboratory and field
work, and the student is given an op
portunity to witness biological life in
its natural surroundings.
{ At present the station is negotiating
for a diving suit so that the students
may explore the under water area of
the bay. Last summer two students
tried helmet diving, but found the
water too cold.
A baseball game between faculty and
students used to be an annual event
i at Stanford.
