# DR. WILLIAM ANDERSON TO LECTURE FRIDAY ON THE FUTURE FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT
## 
### 
The independence of local govern
ment is declining, said Professor Wil
liam Anderson in the Little Theater
Friday night, where he spoke on "The
Outlook for Local Government."
"The small, independent systems can
not keep up with the times," Professor
Anderson declared. "They cannot meet
modern demands. I think the next 25
or 50 years will see the state playing
a more important role. State supervi
sion of local affairs has gone far. It
will go further."
He does not believe our local systems
will be entirely crowded out from the
governmental machinery of the future.
Local units will survive, but they will
be larger and fewer.
"The state will be more and more in
control of local affairs." Professor An
derson prophesied. "There will be
fewer counties, fewer special districts
and even fewer villages. Government
will be much more efficient because it
will be more centralized."
Making a survey of the conception of
local government from its earliest be
ginnings, the professor pointed out
there were really two basic concepts.
"The first," he said, "was that local
communities had the right to manage
their own affairs without interference.
The second was that local affairs
should be administered by local citi
zens, every individual owing his serv
ices to the community without pay."
This second concept has now almost
disappeared. It arose from the distrust
of early English kings for paid officials,
and it was opposed rather than cher
ished by the citizens. The wealthy
bought exemptions from public serv
ice, and the labor fell almost entirely
on the poor. This brought local gov
ernment into disrepute, and it sank to a
low ebb in the sixteenth and seven
teenth centuries.
"Not only in England but in Amer
ica was this system used," Professor
Anderson said. "It seems incredible to
modern people that at one time in New
York City the citizens were obliged by
Jaw to build and repair their own
streets, provide their own street lamps,
haul away and dispose of their own
garbage, and perform many other func
tions now discharged by paid em
ployees of the government."
The advantage of the system was that
it saved taxes. Modern conditions
gradually forced it out until now the

[ only real public duty of the local citi
zen is to pay taxes.
These taxes have increased tremen
! dously, Professor Anderson pointed
! out. He estimated that local taxes in
the early republic were than one
- hundredth of one per cent of what they
are today. More than 2,000,000 men
and women are now on public pay
' rolls.
"The gradual encroachment of the
j state into local affairs will bring with
it lower taxes and increased efficiency
|he declared. "There has been much
j improvement already, and there will be
, more."
