# Beware of 'Black Widow,' California Officials Warn
## 
### 
If you should detect Mrs. Latrodectus
i Mactans stalking toward any exposed
portion of your anatomy during this
| vacation season, reach for the nearest
1 flyswatter, club or whatnot, and let
j her have it. For she is none other
[ than the much feared and dangerous
j "Black Widow" spider, and she has a
I fondness for the habitations and re
j treats of man.
Mrs. Mactans is everywhere in Cali
i fornia, according to an admonitory and
informative bulletin issued by the Uni
versity of California. While her sup
posed aggressiveness and the potency
of her venom have been considerably
; exaggerated, her bite is serious and
demands prompt attention. While she
is held indirectly responsible for 13 re
corded deaths in California since 1930,
! the known fatalities from her bite are

extremely rare. A number of the deaths ,
recorded were of aged persons, and
were doubtless caused by complications |
which were aggravated by the spider's !
venom.
