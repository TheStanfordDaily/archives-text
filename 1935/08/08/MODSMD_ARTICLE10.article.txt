# Progressive Education Program Described by Dr. Paul R. Hanna
## 
### 
"We need to have a better under- j
standing of what is meant by the term j
'progressive education'," Dr. Paul R. i
Hanna, professor of education at Stan
ford, said here today in an interview.
He declared that many schools have
made a cult of the movement without
; an adequate understanding of the un
derlying philosophy.
Dr. Hanna pointed out that a defini
tion such as John Dewey's, "all educa
tion proceeds by the participation of
the individual in the social conscious
ness of the race," is fundamental to
! any discussion of the progressive move
ment.
I The development of this clearer con
-1 ception will assist the movement in
i avoiding many of the pitfalls that have
been a source of criticism in the past,
j he said.
Growth of Movement
i In speaking of the growth of the
movement Dr. Hanna stated that it is
I a "recognition of the truths contained
| in the works of certain philosophers,
i such as Dewey." He told of the spo
j iadic growth from the first attempts to
j develop the idea at the University of
I Chicago.
"In the past five years whole cities
j and states have swung into the pro- '
j gressive movement," he declared. Cali- I
1 fornia, Florida, Virginia, Mississippi,
; New York, and Arkansas are the lead- j
I ing states in this development.
Dr. Hanna told of the changes to be ,
' made in the schools of New York City j
; next year. There will be no grading,
j there will be universal promotions, and
report cards are to be given up in favor
lof personal notes to parents. This pro
, gram is to be used in the first six grades
! throughout the city.
"Teacher training is tob narrow in
the elementary and secondary fields,"
he said, speaking of the type of teacher
needed for the progressive school. Dr. j
Hanna declared that the teacher must ,
develop the ability to see lelationships
through wider contacts with the world
at large. They must know that society
and their profession are constantly j
changing.
"We would have little confidence in i
the doctor who had never attended a
clinic or read a professional magazine
since his training 25 years ago. It is as i
necessary for the teacher to keep
abreast of professional developments as
it is for the doctor, for our job is often
of greater influence than his," Dr.
Hanna added.
The tremendous teacher resistance to
progressive education is partly a re- i
i suit of economic conditions in the field, J
he continued. Better compensations |
must be provided along with the higher j
professional standard demanded by the |
progressive schools.
Salary Schedules
In this connection he told of the plan I
' adopted by some of the cities in which
a single salary schedule is provided for
i the whole system. Regardless of where
! the teacher is working, her pay is based
I on her training, her experience, and
her professional and social alertness.
The progressive movement will prob
[ ably lead to smaller classes, especially
; in the elementary school. "It is impos

sible for a teacher to study each per
sonality in a class of 40 or 50. The
class must not be too large if the high- ]
est type of teaching is to be obtained,"
he asserted.
Dr. Hanna mentioned the spread of
the movement into the colleges. Sev- i
eral colleges, notably the General Col
lege of the University of Minnesota and
the Teachers College of Columbia Uni
versity, are adjusting their own cur
ricula to the ideals of the progressive
education movement, he explained.

bison of the Department of Military
Science and Tactics has been ordered

must be provided along with the higher j

progressive schools.
Salary Schedules
In this connection he told of the plan I
' adopted by some of the cities in which
a single salary schedule is provided for
i the whole system. Regardless of where
! the teacher is working, her pay is based
I on her training, her experience, and
her professional and social alertness.
The progressive movement will prob
[ ably lead to smaller classes, especially
; in the elementary school. "It is impos

sible for a teacher to study each per
sonality in a class of 40 or 50. The
class must not be too large if the high- ]
est type of teaching is to be obtained,"
he asserted.
Dr. Hanna mentioned the spread of
the movement into the colleges. Sev- i
eral colleges, notably the General Col
lege of the University of Minnesota and
the Teachers College of Columbia Uni
versity, are adjusting their own cur
ricula to the ideals of the progressive
education movement, he explained.

"We need to have a better under- j
standing of what is meant by the term j
'progressive education'," Dr. Paul R. i
Hanna, professor of education at Stan
ford, said here today in an interview.
He declared that many schools have
made a cult of the movement without
; an adequate understanding of the un
derlying philosophy.
Dr. Hanna pointed out that a defini
tion such as John Dewey's, "all educa
tion proceeds by the participation of
the individual in the social conscious
ness of the race," is fundamental to
! any discussion of the progressive move
ment.
I The development of this clearer con
-1 ception will assist the movement in
i avoiding many of the pitfalls that have
been a source of criticism in the past,
j he said.
Growth of Movement
i In speaking of the growth of the
movement Dr. Hanna stated that it is
I a "recognition of the truths contained
| in the works of certain philosophers,
i such as Dewey." He told of the spo
j iadic growth from the first attempts to
j develop the idea at the University of
I Chicago.
"In the past five years whole cities
j and states have swung into the pro- '
j gressive movement," he declared. Cali- I
1 fornia, Florida, Virginia, Mississippi,
; New York, and Arkansas are the lead- j
I ing states in this development.
Dr. Hanna told of the changes to be ,
' made in the schools of New York City j
; next year. There will be no grading,
j there will be universal promotions, and
report cards are to be given up in favor
lof personal notes to parents. This pro
, gram is to be used in the first six grades
! throughout the city.
"Teacher training is tob narrow in
the elementary and secondary fields,"
he said, speaking of the type of teacher
needed for the progressive school. Dr. j
Hanna declared that the teacher must ,
develop the ability to see lelationships
through wider contacts with the world
at large. They must know that society
and their profession are constantly j
changing.
"We would have little confidence in i
the doctor who had never attended a
clinic or read a professional magazine
since his training 25 years ago. It is as i
necessary for the teacher to keep
abreast of professional developments as
it is for the doctor, for our job is often
of greater influence than his," Dr.
Hanna added.
The tremendous teacher resistance to
progressive education is partly a re- i
i suit of economic conditions in the field, J
he continued. Better compensations |
must be provided along with the higher j
professional standard demanded by the |
progressive schools.
