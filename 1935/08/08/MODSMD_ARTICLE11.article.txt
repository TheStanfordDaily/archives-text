# Socialites Gather To See Thoroughbreds on Parade
## 
### 
In a brilliantly lighted outdoor pa- j
i vilion, Ihe San Mateo County National j
1 Horse Show is being held nightly at !
j the Menlo Circus Club in Atherton.
Drawing socialites and horse lovers |
I from all parts of the country, this gala i
| event presents the champions of the [
j tanbark ring to crowded galleries.
The trumpeter in his brilliant red j
| coat opens each event by blowing a
i short blast. One by one the horses in
\ the important five-gaited class enter I
i the ring. Starting at a walk, and pass- 1
| ing by command through their various
; gaits, these blue bloods of the show 1
| parade in all their glory. Chestnuts,
bays, roans, and greys, with necks j
j arched and hoofs flung high, pass be- |
' fore the critical eye of the judges.
Finally all line up before the judges
i stand and are scored for conformation. ,
Then a moment of suspense, and the
, name of the winner is announced. The
| riders move forward, get their prize
ribbons, and proudly exhibit their
mounts before the crowd. With ribbons
grasped in their teeth, the riders guide
their mounts out of the ring as the
bugle blows for the next event.
The show will have its final display
Saturday night. Tickets may be ob
tained at Kceble's or at the Allied
Arts.
