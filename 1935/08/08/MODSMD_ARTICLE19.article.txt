# Stanford Is Different
## 
### 
I ho average American college is usually thought of ;is a four
year stopping place from which students are glad to got out into
the world. 'I hoy remember .Alma Mater only when the football
season comes around, or when alumni conventions are hold.
Hut Stanford means far more to its graduates than Ibis.. To
many ot them it is not only a college but a permanent homo as
well. The almost perfect climate, the beautiful landscaping, and
the lovely buildings combine to make it a unique beauty spot. Nor
must the cultural advantages be overlooked. Certainly the fine
museums and libraries, the incomparable Memorial Church, and
the concerts and plays enjoyed by Stanfordites would bo hard to
duplicate.
Hut the appeal ot the University lies not only in more facilities
or beauty. I here is an undeniable atmosphere of friendliness and
charm that arises from years of tradition, fostering loyalties and
excluding the potty bickerings and hostilities that are prevalent
elsewhere. One who has once known this atmosphere can never
forget it.
And so Ihe graduates come back to the campus in after years to
seek again Ihe things they could find nowhere else. Our little com
munity grows larger and larger with the passing years; Stanford
is less and loss a mere institution for forcing knowledge in un
willing students. To an ever increasing number of us it is "homo."
