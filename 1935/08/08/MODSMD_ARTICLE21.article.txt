## 
### 
With the avowed purpose of orient
ing the modern student in the city of
. London and enabling him to under
stand the background of Elizabethan
life as it affected Shakespearean plays,
Professor E. O. James of Mills College
discussed "Elizabethan Picture Maps"
last night. This lecture, the seventh of
the series of Tudor lectures given in
connection with the courses in Shake
spearean production, was held in the
Women's Clubhouse.
"I wish to show the development of
the early picture views of Tudor Lon
don into actual maps," said Professor
James, illustrating his talk with lan
tern slides. He began with the Van
Wyngarcjp views dating from the
1540's and continued with views and
maps down to the plans for the re
building of London after the fire.
Professor James brought with him a
full-sized facsimile of the Agas map '
of London, late seventeenth century
maps of the shires around London and
of Warwickshire, a copy of the 1633
(third) edition of Stow, and Camden's i
Britania.
The lecturer included some comment
upon the contemporary writers who 1
had the clearest sense of their city, !
Stow being first in importance. Pro
fessor James also spoke of the organi
zation of the greater guilds and showed
iomt of their coats-of-arms.
