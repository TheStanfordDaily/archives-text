Q. Where is the famous Roble
Bridge?
A. Roble Bridge has been torn down.
It used to be out at the end of Portola
Road, bridging San Francisquito Creek.
Q. Where is the Hoover home?
A. It is practically impossible to tell
a sightseer exactly how to reach the
Hoover residence on San Juan Hill,
but according to the student guides at
the entrance of Memorial Court, the
best way to reach it from there is to
"turn right at Lasuen, right at Dolores,
and right at Mirada." And you had
better ask questions all the way.
