# NEED OF ETHIOPIAN ECONOMIC RESOURCES GIVEN AS CAUSE OF ITALIAN PENETRATION

This is the second of a series of
three articles tracing the background
of the tense situation in Ethiopia.—
The Editor.) .
Many people have the mistaken idea
that Ethiopia is t country of jungle
wastes o£ no possible use to any Eu
ropean nation. Thus they see no reason
for the Italian penetration of this coun
try other than a desire for more colonial
possessions.
This is a misconception for the Ethi
opian region is very far from being
jungle. Ethiopia is an inland country
of east central Africa, rich in natural
resources and not totally African
swampland.
Bounded on the northeast by Italy's
province of Eritrea, on the west and
northwest by England's Anglo Sudan,
on the south by British East Africa,
and on the east by French and Italian
possessions of Somaliland it is a state
of artificial conception with boundaries
formed by other governments rather
than by natural dividing lines. These
boundaries were drawn by a group of
countries during the race for empires in
the 80's.
Italy Makes Excuses
Italy is making excuses for its pene
tration of this African region, but back
of these excuses are some real reasons
why Italy would like to own this coun
try, or at least establish a protectorate
over it.
Upon looking into the economic sit-

I uation of this country one finds that it
is backward but abounding in
resources.
This state has developed an extensive
export trade in coffee, hides, ivory,
civet, ostrich feathers, gum, and pepper.
But still there is one natural resource
which is of increasing importance to
any country that has ideas of develop
' ing prosperous industries. This raw
material is petroleum, a resource which
Italy lacks.
Need of Colony
It is also a well known fact that Italy
has been keeping a watchful eye for
i some time on a possible colony to form
( a place for Italian citizens because the
i mother country is already overpopu
lated.
J In this African country is an opening
: for such a settlement of Italian citizens,
j The climate in Ethiopia is by no means
an impossible one. In fact, this climate
ranges from that of lowland swamps to
that of Alpine height, and such range of
j climatic conditions would lend itself
'well to an "Italian colony.
Back of Italy's desires for penetration
'of this country is the fact that she
| would like to link Eritrea and the Ital
ian Somaliland so she would no longer
have to cross French territory to take
j exports and imports to and from these
possessions.
| It is easily seen that Ethiopia has
made itself attractive in the eyes of
Mussolini and other wide-awake Ital
' ians.
