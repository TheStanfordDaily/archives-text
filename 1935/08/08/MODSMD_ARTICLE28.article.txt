# Wisconsin To Have Right To Famous College Song
## 
### 
"On Wisconsin," one of the most
famous college songs in America, will
become the property of the University
of Wisconsin for the first time since it
was written more than 20 year ago
unless legal obstacles intervene.
Carl Beck, New York, former uni
versity student who went back to the
; Wisconsin campus recently for the re
union of the class of 1910, wrote the
j words for the song which the late John
I Philip Sousa called "the most stirring,
enthusiastic college melody ever heard."
Since it was written in 1909 the song
has been the property of a Milwaukee
music publishing firm. The copyright
expires in 1937 and Beck, who has the
privilege of renewing it, will then turn
it over to the university, he said.
The music for the song was written
| by William T. Purdy, who died in 1918.
j Purdy never went to school at Wiscon
! sin and when he wrote the music it
j was intended for a Minnesota song.
