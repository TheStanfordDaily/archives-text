# VARSITY LINE-UP ADDS NAMES OF TWO NEWCOMERS
## 18 Lettermen To Be Nucleus Of 1935 Football Contingent 
### 
Two new men will be in the line-up 1
of the Stanford varsity when it begins
its fall campaign. Bill Paulman, the |
sophomore who showed so well in the j
recent spring practice, may take over !
Frank Alustiza's job at quarter, and in j
that case the veteran campaigner will
be shifted to right half. Dale Beedle is !
the other newcomer to the first string j
line-up and will hold down the tackle ,
post vacated by Claude Callaway who j
will not return to school this fall.
Eighteen lettermen, including nine
regulars, will be in harness. Around
this nucleus may be added some good j
reserves from the 1934 squad, several .
likely looking prospects from last sea
son's freshmen, and a handful of mis- i
cellaneous prospects.
When the season opens, the Indians !
will be in a similar position to that of j
a year ago. They will be a tough team
to beat provided they do not run into i
bad luck. The two most serious prob
lems for Coach Tiny Thornhill to face
will be in securing tackles and reserves, j
Left Tackle Returns
Bob Reynolds, Stanford's all-Ameri- i
can left tackle, will be back to strength- j
en that post, and a great responsibility |
will rest on the shoulders of Dale |
Beedle in upholding right tackle. j
Should Beedle need support, he will j
find plenty from Harry Carlson, John >
Grant, Jelf Holbroo'k, and Bob Mangan,
of the 1934 subs. Two freshmen and ,
Bob Dakan, Russ McKinney, Don Mc- |
Millan, and Richard Shannon will also i
make a bid for a tackle post.
Monk Moscrip, all-American, and
Keith Topping, will take care of the
wings. These two are as fine a combi
nation as has been seen on the Pacific
Coast for some time. To back them up,
Carl Schott, Alex Trompas, and Jack
Clark will be on hand. Roger Munger,
a reserve who showed ability in spring
practice, may see much service. Ches
ter Olcott a junior college transfer and
Walt Chouteau, a reserve from the
.1934 squad may come up fast. The
frosh sends up five candidates for end
posts in John Wyeth, Berneth Layer,
Kenneth Peters, Cyril Oberg, and Grant
Stone.
Many Guards Back
The "Five and Ten Boys," Larry
Rouble, and Woody Adams, will share
their guard posts with Bob Black as in
1934. Jack Walton, Rouble's substitute
last season, will be back as will Dave
Cuneo and Tom Callahan, a great pair
of guai'd reserves. Charle Drace will
move up from the frosh, and Don Pin
ncll and James White are other pros
pects.
Alf Brandin and Wes Muller will
continue their battle for the first team
center job. Both these men are capable
performers, and the team suffers no
setback with either in a game. Louis
Tsoutsouvas, sub on the 1934 squad, and
Charles Heath, freshman, are pivot un
derstudies.
Hamilton at Left Half
If Bill Paulman plays quarter and
Alustiza is moved to right half, the
spark plug, Bones Hamilton will be
shifted from right to left half. Bones is
right at home at any of the back
posts, and this move may give him fur
ther opportunity to show what a really
great player he is. Ail-American Bob
Grayson will be back at fullback ready
to begin where he left oft last season.
Ray Todd, who hobbled to fame in the
Big Game last year will be available
to sub for Grayson, and frosh Glenn
Hamilton may see some action.
Two lettermen, John Reisner and
Fred Williams, will see much service
at the halfback posts. Joe Vigna, who
showed so well this spring, will also be

a threat at half. Four freshmen will |
be after back berths. They are Doc !
Luckett, Leo Madlem, Tom Collins, and j
Jim CofTis. Shelley Bronstein returns j
to moleskins after a year lay off due to i
injuries. i

setback with either in a game. Louis
Tsoutsouvas, sub on the 1934 squad, and
Charles Heath, freshman, are pivot un
derstudies.
Hamilton at Left Half
If Bill Paulman plays quarter and
Alustiza is moved to right half, the
spark plug, Bones Hamilton will be
shifted from right to left half. Bones is
right at home at any of the back
posts, and this move may give him fur
ther opportunity to show what a really
great player he is. Ail-American Bob
Grayson will be back at fullback ready
to begin where he left oft last season.
Ray Todd, who hobbled to fame in the
Big Game last year will be available
to sub for Grayson, and frosh Glenn
Hamilton may see some action.
Two lettermen, John Reisner and
Fred Williams, will see much service
at the halfback posts. Joe Vigna, who
showed so well this spring, will also be

a threat at half. Four freshmen will |
be after back berths. They are Doc !
Luckett, Leo Madlem, Tom Collins, and j
Jim CofTis. Shelley Bronstein returns j
to moleskins after a year lay off due to i
injuries. i
Two new men will be in the line-up 1
of the Stanford varsity when it begins
its fall campaign. Bill Paulman, the |
sophomore who showed so well in the j
recent spring practice, may take over !
Frank Alustiza's job at quarter, and in j
that case the veteran campaigner will
be shifted to right half. Dale Beedle is !
the other newcomer to the first string j
line-up and will hold down the tackle ,
post vacated by Claude Callaway who j
will not return to school this fall.
Eighteen lettermen, including nine
regulars, will be in harness. Around
this nucleus may be added some good j
reserves from the 1934 squad, several .
likely looking prospects from last sea
son's freshmen, and a handful of mis- i
cellaneous prospects.
When the season opens, the Indians !
will be in a similar position to that of j
a year ago. They will be a tough team
to beat provided they do not run into i
bad luck. The two most serious prob
lems for Coach Tiny Thornhill to face
will be in securing tackles and reserves, j
Left Tackle Returns
Bob Reynolds, Stanford's all-Ameri- i
can left tackle, will be back to strength- j
en that post, and a great responsibility |
will rest on the shoulders of Dale |
Beedle in upholding right tackle. j
Should Beedle need support, he will j
find plenty from Harry Carlson, John >
Grant, Jelf Holbroo'k, and Bob Mangan,
of the 1934 subs. Two freshmen and ,
Bob Dakan, Russ McKinney, Don Mc- |
Millan, and Richard Shannon will also i
make a bid for a tackle post.
Monk Moscrip, all-American, and
Keith Topping, will take care of the
wings. These two are as fine a combi
nation as has been seen on the Pacific
Coast for some time. To back them up,
Carl Schott, Alex Trompas, and Jack
Clark will be on hand. Roger Munger,
a reserve who showed ability in spring
practice, may see much service. Ches
ter Olcott a junior college transfer and
Walt Chouteau, a reserve from the
.1934 squad may come up fast. The
frosh sends up five candidates for end
posts in John Wyeth, Berneth Layer,
Kenneth Peters, Cyril Oberg, and Grant
Stone.
Many Guards Back
The "Five and Ten Boys," Larry
Rouble, and Woody Adams, will share
their guard posts with Bob Black as in
1934. Jack Walton, Rouble's substitute
last season, will be back as will Dave
Cuneo and Tom Callahan, a great pair
of guai'd reserves. Charle Drace will
move up from the frosh, and Don Pin
ncll and James White are other pros
pects.
Alf Brandin and Wes Muller will
continue their battle for the first team
