# FIRE FIGHTERS ARE SWAMPED IN YEARLY RUSH
## 
### 
: The Stanford Fire Department is very
j busy these days, but not in the line of
i regular duty. Ail hands plus five extra
j student firemen are concentrating on a
yearly check of their equipment.
The 18 boxes and 10 miles of aerial
wire in the fire alarm system are being
examined, and the several hundred ex
tinguishers arc to be emptied, cleaned,
; and refilled.
In asking for co-operation in report
ing fires, Chief Dugan says, "Residents
on the campus should always remember
that the pulling of a fire alarm box gets
response a great deal more quickly than
any other method. There is always a
chance of confusion and mistakes when
fires are reported by telephone, and
time is what counts in fighting a fire."
Firemen can get to the farthest alarm
box on the campus in less than three
minutes from the time the alarm is
sent.
In their ordinary routine the regular
firemen are drilled every Sunday after
noon on the drill tower in the Corpora
tion Yard. Under the direction of Chief
Dugan they are given intensive train
ing in the use of the different types of
fire fighting and life saving apparatus.
In spite of the pressure of their offi
cial duties, the firemen have found
time to build a de luxe horse-shoe pit,
inlaid with 24 buckets of the finest
Corporation Yard sand.
