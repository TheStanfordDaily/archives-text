# MONKEYS OBJECT TO NOISY DRILLING
## 
### 
About 25 monkeys belonging to
the Department of Bacteriology
arc tearing their hair and working
themselves into a rage. The en
gineer's office reports that these
animals have been screaming
since early Saturday morning.
The monkeys started scolding
Saturday when workmen com
menced a job under the Anatomy
Building. Air hammers are being
used to drill through the cement
floor for the installation of the new
900-foot sewer which is to make
possible the enlarging of the anat
omy and bacteriology laboratories,
and their din is driving the monk
eys "nuts."
Workmen say the monkeys
could probably be arrested for
what they are saying if an English
translation were possible.
