# ARMY MEN STUDY FOR PROMOTIONS
## 
### 
i Dignified Army officers have turned
! into students over at the R.O.T.C. head
j quarters. They are "cramming for
1 exams" like so many freshmen.
j The reason for this is the new Army
j Promotions Act. This measure, which
I has been sought by Army officials for
j many years, permits officers to take
I examinations for promotions. The first
| of these examinations will be given at
I the San Francisco Presidio Friday,
j Officers at Stanford who will take
i ihe examinations are as follows: Lieu-
I tenant-Colonel D. C. Cubbison, who
i seeks the rank of colonel; Captain
/Stewart F. Miller, candidate for'the
| rank of major, and Lieutenants Hay
! don Y. Grubbs and John F. Bird, who
! seek captaincies.
The Arm>Â» Promotions Act was en
acted by Congress on July 31 and ob
-1 tained presidential signature in the
! record time of one hour. Army authori
| ties believe that about 40 per cent of
I the present Army men will change
j ranks under the new system. Promo
; lions will now be given on a basis of
! ability instead of seniority. Under the
i old system many officers of ability were
) forced to wait for many years before
I a higher rank could be obtained.
