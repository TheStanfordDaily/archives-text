# Coon Speaks On Economics In Radio Talk
## More National Co-ordination, Use of Set Economy Recommended Balanced Budget, Low Prices Cited as Imperative 
### 
That better co-ordinated national
policies in harmony with the known
principles of economic law would
achieve more in the way of general
economic security than would haphaz
ard planning, was the general thesis of
a talk on economic security, on the
Stanford Radio Hour last night. Pro
fessor Shirley J. Coon, member of the
Stanford summer faculty and School of
Economics and Business at the Univer
sity of Washington, was the speaker.
In commenting on laissez-faire, Pro
fessor Coon said, "This policy has re
sulted in a tremendous development of
material productivity in the past cen
tury but it has also permitted an ap
palling disregard for human factors."
Complex Causes
In speaking of economic panaceas, the
economist declared they are all infected
with at least one error. "They imply
that if some one fault were corrected
COON SPEAKS .. . . k6s,S
then all of our troubles would be over.
The fact is that our troubles grow out
of a very complex set of causes."
In discussing the difficulties of work
ing out an economic plan, he explained,
"Social science lags behind natural and
physical science because most of our
social problems, which are not the re
sults of our mistakes, grow out of
changing technology. Since one cannot
predict the changes in technology, one
cannot solve in advance the problems
of which he is unaware."
Must Free Prices
According to Professor Coon, a con
structive program by which we might
hope to bring about greater stability
and security might well be based on
these requirements:
Prices must be freed from control
wherever it is possible to do so in the
public interest; production of necessary
goods must be expanded to lower prices;
a sound currency and safe banking are
needed; foreign trade restrictions must
be minimized; and the federal budget
must be balanced.
In conclusion the speaker said of
these policies, "Some of the resulting
adjustments would be very painful, es
pecially to marginal producers, and
workers in redundant industries. But
we cannot escape facing the facts event
ually; the individual victims of social
changes are justly a social responsi
bility."-
Trial and Error
In a talk on economic planning
Thursday night, Professor Coon pre
dicted there will be more government
in industry in the future. He pointed
out the admitted present experiment
has proven so expensive that the gov-*
crnment faces uncontrolled inflation
and claimed, "Trial and error is the
last resort of the ignorant and experi
ments with society are made at an
appalling cost."
In discussing the suggested panaceas,
he branded them as "hocus-pocus eco
nomics" saying, "All of the new eco
nomic schemes fail to take into consid
eration that the laws of economics have
not changed with the shift from in
dividualism to government control.

According to Professor Coon, a con
structive program by which we might
hope to bring about greater stability
and security might well be based on
these requirements:
Prices must be freed from control
wherever it is possible to do so in the
public interest; production of necessary
goods must be expanded to lower prices;
a sound currency and safe banking are
needed; foreign trade restrictions must
be minimized; and the federal budget
must be balanced.
In conclusion the speaker said of
these policies, "Some of the resulting
adjustments would be very painful, es
pecially to marginal producers, and
workers in redundant industries. But
we cannot escape facing the facts event
ually; the individual victims of social
changes are justly a social responsi
bility."-
Trial and Error
In a talk on economic planning
Thursday night, Professor Coon pre
dicted there will be more government
in industry in the future. He pointed
out the admitted present experiment
has proven so expensive that the gov-*
crnment faces uncontrolled inflation
and claimed, "Trial and error is the
last resort of the ignorant and experi
ments with society are made at an
appalling cost."
In discussing the suggested panaceas,
he branded them as "hocus-pocus eco
nomics" saying, "All of the new eco
nomic schemes fail to take into consid
eration that the laws of economics have
not changed with the shift from in
dividualism to government control.
That better co-ordinated national
policies in harmony with the known
principles of economic law would
achieve more in the way of general
economic security than would haphaz
ard planning, was the general thesis of
a talk on economic security, on the
Stanford Radio Hour last night. Pro
fessor Shirley J. Coon, member of the
Stanford summer faculty and School of
Economics and Business at the Univer
sity of Washington, was the speaker.
In commenting on laissez-faire, Pro
fessor Coon said, "This policy has re
sulted in a tremendous development of
material productivity in the past cen
tury but it has also permitted an ap
palling disregard for human factors."
Complex Causes
In speaking of economic panaceas, the
economist declared they are all infected
with at least one error. "They imply
that if some one fault were corrected
COON SPEAKS .. . . k6s,S
then all of our troubles would be over.
The fact is that our troubles grow out
of a very complex set of causes."
In discussing the difficulties of work
ing out an economic plan, he explained,
"Social science lags behind natural and
physical science because most of our
social problems, which are not the re
sults of our mistakes, grow out of
changing technology. Since one cannot
predict the changes in technology, one
cannot solve in advance the problems
of which he is unaware."
