# Fish That Walk on Dry Land, Other Queer Fish Discussed by Dr. Herre
## 
### 
Did you ever sec a fish walking on ,
| dry land?
No? Well, Doctor Albert Herre has.
As curator of the Stanford Natural His
' tory Museum and an ardent ichthyolo
, gist, he has seen a great many other
j queer fish. Sharpshooting fish. Fish
i that swim standing on their heads. Fish
j that eat men. And fish that are eaten
I by men, but which arc so small that
j ten thousand of them barely make one
| decent meal.
1 The walking fish is called the "mud
â–  skipper," and it is found in such widely
separated localities as Africa, North
I Australia, and Samoa. Its fins arc long
i and stiff and can be used as rudi
-1 mentary legs. Its breathing apparatus is
| so designed that it can stay out of water
' for long periods of time.
Fish Aims Well
The sharpshooting fish, says Dr.
j Herre, is called "Toxotes Jaculator."
I The species is also found in Australia
and in India. No Kentucky mountaineer
lever had a better aim than this little
| fish possesses, though his "bullet" is
only a drop of water. Cruising along
, in the water and spying an insect near
I the surface, it aims its deadly drop and
j lets fly. Water-logged, the insect falls
j and is immediately devoured by the
i sharpshooter, who then swims on in
\ search of another victim.
i An even queerer fish is "centriscus
scutatus" (shrimp fish to jou!) found
! in Persia. The shrimp fish actually
I s\Vims upside down, its head pointing
I toward the sea-bottom and its tail wav-

I ing nonchalantly above. Nor is this the
I shrimp fish's only peculiarity. It has a
i completely transparent spot located in
j the center of its body covered only by a
i thin membrane. No explanation has
I ever been found for this living X-ray,
I through which the inner mechanism of
j the creature is plainly visible. Nor is it
1 known why it prefers to swim standing
on its head.
Deadly Fish
The Caribe fish from the Amazon
j River are not unusual to look at. They
are less than a foot long and very harm
' less in appearance. Yet they arc the
j deadliest creatures for their size on
; earth. They will attack anything, how
ever large and powerful. Animals and
I even men have fallen prey to schools of
these vicious little fish, and they can
strip a man's body to a skeleton in a few
I minutes.
Tlie "Mistickthys" fish that live in
Lake Buhi are an edible variety, but
they arc so tiny as to be almost in
visible to the naked eye. Many thou
j sands of these fish are served for a
single meal, but their flavor, according
to Dr. Herre, more than makes up for
| their small size.
Dr. Herre has seen many other
strange and unusual fish in his travels.
He recently returned to the University
from Washington, D.C., where he com
pleted his studies of the collection of
fish which he made last year in the
Malay Peninsula. This collection con
; , tains many rare varieties, several of
i them hitherto unknown.
