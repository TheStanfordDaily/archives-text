# Othello Enters Finishing Stage Of Production
## A.S.S.U. Office Reports Good Advance Ticket Sale For Play First Dress Rehearsal Held Last Evening 
### 
With a good advance sale of tickets
for Othello reported by the A.S.S.U.
| ofTice and the iirst dress-rehearsal hav
i ing taken place last night, final prepa
rations for the presentation of the play
on Friday and Saturday evenings arc
now being made.
The production is the first all-cam
pus presentation to be attempted at
Stanford and is the result of a quarter's
| woi k by the class in Shakespearean
production under the direction of Wil
liam Thornton. Also contributing to
the production is the work done by the
class in costume design under Mrs.
Helen Green and the class in theater
workshop under Orville Goldner.
One interesting feature of the play
will be fanfares for the trumpet and
trombone composed by Dr. Sigfrid
Prager, director of the Madison Civic-
Symphony Orchestra and lecturer on
music here this summer. These fan
fares composed especially for this per
formance will add dignity to the open
ings of scenes and martial processionals.
Annelies Morgan in the role of Des
demona will sing "The Willow Song"
in the "Willow, Willow" scene which
appears just before the last action of
the tragedy. Other than this singing
and the fanfares there will be no music
in the production in order to keep the
quality of the mood as severe as pos
sible.
Certain of the properties in the play
have an historical as well as dramatic
value. Mr. Thornton as Othello will
use the dagger worn by Salvini, per
haps the greatest of Othellos. The
scimitar used by Mr. Thornton in the
part has been loaned by Mr. Frederick
Buck, in whose family it has been an
heirloom for hundreds of years.
Tickets for the play may be obtained
at the A.S.S.U. ofTice in the old Union
or at Keebles in Palo Alto at 25, 50, 75
cents and a dollar.
