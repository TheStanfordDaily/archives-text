We at Stanford are fortunate in having here the noteworthy
exhibition now presented in the Art Gallery. This choice collection
of paintings has been culled from some of the finest private collec
tions in the world.
There is a phase to this artistic showing which until now has
not been given enough emphasis. While we realize that our Uni
versity merits high regard and praise, still it is gratifying to know
that others are of the same opinion to the extent that they are
willing to share their artistic riches with lis. There may be a mon
etary value placed on the paintings in the Art Gallery, but the gen
erous thought behind the lenders and the l>encfits obtained by the
visitors are priceless.
Proof of the appreciation visitors have for the collection lies
in the great attendance at the gallery since the exhibition started.
Thousands have viewed the display in just a few days, and the
Sunday crowds are record-breaking. Sale of the explanatory cata
logues has also been large.
This exhibition is intended not only for the specialist; rather,
if is for the comparatively uninformed average citizen who desires
fuller knowledge and appreciation of art.
Stanford University is deeply grateful to those who have gen
erously shared their fine paintings with her students.—E. L. li.
