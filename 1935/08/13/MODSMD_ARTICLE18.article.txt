## 
### 
Original copies of the "extra" thai
heralded the fall of the Bastile, and also
copies of the Belgian "Nieuwe Tyding
hen" and the Parisian "Gazette de
France," believed to be among the
oldest newspapers in the world, have
come into the possession of the Univer
sity of California library in an out
standing collection of 40,000 newspapers
of all nations. The collection dates from
1(520, when the "Nieuwe Tydinghen"
first made its appearance, to 1920, when
the collector, Leon Clerbois, came to
the United States from Brussels, where
he had been an official of the municipal
government for 40 years.
Clerbois' interest in the collection of
newspapers was first aroused when he
came on several original copies of the
"Nieuwe Tydinghen" in the itttic Â«>f the
famous Palace d'Oremberg in Brussels,
many years ago. Investigating further
ht found that the paper was started in

Antwerp in 1620 by Abraham Ver
hoeven, and that its original place of
publication, together with the ancient
press and wooden type, was still in
existence.
The collection has been installed in a
special room in the University of Cali
fornia Library.
