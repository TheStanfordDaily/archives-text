# Savelle Uses Photo-Aid in Writing Book
## 
### 
A new method of research is being
I carried out on the campus. Professor
i Maxwell H. Savelle of the history de
partment is using the resources of mod
| em photographic science to aid him in
writing a book on the American aspects
of the Treaty of Paris, 17G3.
Very little printed material is avail
able on this subject, states Professor
Savelle, most of the information being
in manuscript form. These manuscripts
are divided between the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C., and li
braries in Canada, England, France,
and Spain.
For the past year, Professor Savelle
has spent a large part of his time pho
tographing the various manuscripts
sent to him by the Library of Congress.
Using a small camera of foreign make,
he has produced accurate copies of the
rare documents on a strip of motion
picture film. So sharp are these nega
tives that they can be enlarged to a size
greater than the original page from
which they were taken, without any
loss in accuracy.
From these prints, he assembled a
complete file of the material in the
Washington library.
Unable to obtain the documents from
the Canadian Library, Professor Sa
velle, took his camera to Ottawa, and
made further copies of the material he
needed.
Next year he plans to journey to
Europe, where he will photograph the
remaining manuscripts, and with the
complete material write a book on the
Treaty of Paris from the American
standpoint.
Working in a specially prepared
darkroom in the library, he not only
does his own photography, but also his
developing and enlarging.
