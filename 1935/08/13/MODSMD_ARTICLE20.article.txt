SAN DIEGO â€”Bud luck always seems
to stalk The Rambler. Wherever we go
we always encounter the hottest weath
er of the season. San Diego proves no
exception. It is hot herd Of course,
San Diegans say the weather is un
usual, but being a Californian our
selves, we're used to that story.
FLYING TURNED OUT to be very
monotonous, all except the short
stretch of bumpy air, which we rather
liked. It feels like an elevator in the
Russ Building and helps relieve the
monotony.
THE SAN DIEGO EXPOSITION is
prettier and more colorful than the
Chicago fair, but less complete in the
line of exhibits, midway attractions,
etc. It would probably be a very nice
fair if the weather weren't so hot and
our feet not so blistered. The out
standing attraction is the open air am
phitheater, in which famous symphony
orchestras from all over the country
are playing two-week engagements.
The nudist colony we haven't seen yet,
but even if we had, we couldn't write
about ;t in the dignified Summer
Daily.
