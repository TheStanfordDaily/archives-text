The eternal "fighting Irish" theme
bobs up again at the Stanford Theater
this week, where James Cagney and ;
Pat O'Brien knock each other about in
a picture that is a little above the j
average film fare.
Jimmy and Pat are brothers in this j
picture but they still continue to be ;
rivals in love. The girl is Olivia De-
Havilland, hopelessly miscast but do- J
ing work that is worthy of a better
role. Another brother in the family,
Frank McHugh, manages to entertain
his customers with some oi the most
ancient jokes ever trotted out of a
gag man's notebook.
Comedy honors must be awarded to
Allan Jenkins. His punch-drunk prize
fighter, "Carbarn Hammerschlag," is
more than just good.
The rest of the cast is adequate and
a hilarious prize fight between Mr.
Cagney and an unknown opponent
serves as a climax to an entertaining j
picture. —Young
