# JAPAN, ENGLAND TAKE INTEREST IN ETHIOPIAN CRISIS
## World Watchfulness Forbodes International Trouble In Case of War 
### 
(This is the last of a series of ar
ticles on the Ethiopian crisis.â€”The
Editor.)
As the rainy season approaches in
Ethiopia, the time for the scheduled
Italian attqck draws nearer and other
countries become more and more in
terested. Only last week announce
ments were made to the effect that
Ethiopia was to get arms from Japan.
Why is Japan taking such an inter
est in the situation? She has, at pres
ent, a substantial trade with Ethiopia,
and if Italy seizes this colony the trade
would be lost. Japan has only built up
thus trade in recent years and needs it
to keep her reputation as the coming
economic power of the Pacific. Here is
one reason why Japan is interested in
this country and is against Italy's pene
tration of the region.
Japan Against Italy
It has been mentioned that another
reason for Japan's resistance to this ex
ploitation by Italy is the fact that she
does not care to see the white race gain
any further foothold in Africa. The
Japanese in recent years have been
watching closely the progress of the
white race, and in this instance she be
comes the champion of the black race
against the white perhaps as much as
she is standing against the penetration
of her economic influence by the Ital
ians.
Britain also has interests in this re
gion that she does not care to have af
fected by Italian penetration. In Ethi
opia lie some of the water sources upon
which Great Britain is so dependent for
the production of her cotton in the
region of the Nile. England, through
the uses of these water sources, has
developed a remarkable place for her
self in the cotton market of the world.
Is she going to let Ethiopia fall into the
hands of the Italians and thus see the
fall of her cotton market?
League Action Doubtful
In the meantime the Italians are fur
ther preparing for war in September
but are ever remembering the massacre
of 18!)6. The League of Nations has
been considering the problem but it is
doubtful if it can do anything. The
European nations have little confidence
in the League.
It is remembered that back of the
situation needing merely a match under
it to blow up Europe in 1914 were sev
eral crises in Africa. Will this Ethiopia
crisis be another such case and bring
about the tightening of alliances to the
stage likely to throw Europe into an
other war?
Italy and Mussolini mean business.
The future of Italy depends upon the
seizure of this region. The Italians are
banking all they have on the outcome.
What will it be?
