# UPHILL SLOPE OF TRACK Unnoticed in Years of Use EASTERN STAR LIKES IT
## 
### 
For more than ten years Stanford
sprinters have been running up hill.
This fact was revealed here today by
Professor Charles Moser, engineer in
charge of construction of the new track.
It seems that construction on the new
track showed that the old Angell Field
track sloped at the rate of six inches
in the first hundred yards of the straight
away.
While this small rise has never been
noticed in all the years that the track
has been in use, it is interesting to note
that a famous eastern track star who
visited the University some time ago
remarked that it was the best track he
had ever run on. The reason he gave for
this statement was that he always felt
he was running down hill!
