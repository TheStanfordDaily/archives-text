j At the meeting of the California
; Rugby Union last night an important
| question was discussed. The question
i was whether or not the California
| Rugby Union would continue to allow
i three substitutions in a game or change
|to the international rules which pro-
I hibit any substitution.
It has been suggested that it would
I be a wise move to adhere to the inter
| national rules as a team from Oxford,
I England, will play in this vicinity next
| year. A visiting "All-Black" team from
i New Zealand may likewise be here.
Jim Wyliey and Harry Maloney rep- j
resented Stanford at the meeting.

SWIMMERS WILL
COMPETE

Two of Stanford's entrants in the
Northern California Championships to
be held this Sunday at Fleishhacker
Pool, San Francisco, have been turn
ing in some fine performances in prac
tice.
Bill Lhamon swam the 50-meter
free-style in 26.4 and the 60-yard free
style in 29.5. This remarkable time for
the distance breaks the world's record
by one-tenth of a second.
On the same afternoon Lhamon
watched another Stanford star, Henry
Godman, negotiate the 50-meter free
style in 25.8. The times for both swim
mers is remarkable, especially so since
they were made in a small tank where
two turns were necessary.

BRIGHT LOSES
1500-METER RUN

Norman Bright, former Stanford
track man, now in Europe on a barn
storming trip with an American team,
was defeated in a 1500-meter race after
a brilliant run.
