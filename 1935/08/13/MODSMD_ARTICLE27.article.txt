# DR. HANNA DEFENDS SCHOOL 'REALISTS'
## 
### 
"As long as progressive education
keeps its hands off the basic questions
od the day and stays within the safe
pages of history, it will be tolerated,"
Dr. Paul H. Hanna, professor <>f educa
tion at Stanford points out in an article
entitled "Romance of Reality: a Cur
riculum Problem," which was published
in the May issue of "Progressive Educa
tion."
He shows that there are two groups
within the progressive movement. The
first might be called the "romantic,"
which conceives the purpose of educa
tion to be a method of insulating and
isolating children from all environ
mental factors which are unpleasant.
The curriculum of the "romantic"
I group has "that content which is suffi
ciently removed in time and space so
J that only the more pleasant aspects are
1 remembered."
The second group is concerned with
the basic inconsistencies in our en
vironment. This school hope to recon
struct the social and material environ
ment. They are the "realists." Dr.
Hanna points out that the second school
hopes to remedy social conditions, not
merely for the material benefits, but
rather in order that all our people may
have the time, energy, and opportunity
to enjoy the cultural.
Both schools within the progressive
movement have the same aim, which is
I the production of "the life good to
live." In order to bring about this ideal
j we must "clear the ground of those fac
[ tors which foster poverty in the midst
| of plenty; . . . which keep man's lot so
i hard that he has not time and energy
i with which to develop his own person
ality. When this . . . has been com
pleted . . . we can turn ... to the
more basic educational task of living
creatively," Dr. Hanna concluded.
