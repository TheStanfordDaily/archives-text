# SURVEY OF COLLEGE FACULTY MEMBERS REPORTED BY EELLS AND CLEVELAND
## 
### 
Dr. Walter C. Eells, professor of j
education at Stanford, and Dr. Austin
C. Cleveland, of Taft Junior College,
have reported the results of their study
of faculty inbreeding, in the May and
June issues of the Journal of Higher !
Education.
Taking the source of the degree as
the criterion of inbreeding (selection of
former students as members of the fac
ulty), a survey was made of all institu- !
tions of higher learning on the accred
ited list of the American Council of
Education.
The survey revealed wide variation
in the amount of inbreeding, although
the practice is general throughout the
country. It has shown an increase of
25 per cent during the last decade.
In drawing their conclusions, the au
thors found that "inbreeding exists
among over one-third of 17.000 faculty
members in 219 representative Ameri
can colleges and universities. It is

| greater in the East than in the South
or West; in privately controlled institu
j tions than in those under public con
trol; ... in institutions with strong
graduate schools ... in the older insti-
I tutions . . . among instructors and
: assistant professors than among asso
ciate professors and full professors;
and varies widely in different subject
matter fields."
The conclusions drawn from the sec
! ond paper indicate "that the probabili
ties of academic advancement, schol
arly productivity, and outside profes
] sional recognition are distinctly greater
I for men who have had their academic
: preparation in institutions other than
in those in which they are teaching."
As a result of the study, the authors
raise the question as to whether or not
I the practice of faculty inbreeding may
be "increasingly injurious ... to the
virility of American higher education"
|as evidenced by "lessened academic
J productivity, if not sterility."
