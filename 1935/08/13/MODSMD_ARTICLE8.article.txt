# Goldner Group Still at Work On Stage Sets
## 
### 
Designing and building scenery for
Shakespearean production with only
amateur assistants seemed almost an I
impossibility a few weeks ago, yet Or
ville Goldner has accomplished the i
task.
When the curtain rises for the open- |
ing performance of Othello, everything i
will be in readiness. The bulk of the
work has already been done, and nei
ther Mr. Goldner nor his class feel at 1
all pressed for time.
The set used for Othello has been
designed as a project, in which the !
same set pieces are used in various po
sitions for the changes. A system of
arches," which can be masked off, and 1
pivoted flats constitute the main ele
ment of the set project. An effect of I
i greater mass and solidity has thus been 1
obtained and the set produced is not
only more economical but makes pos- j
sible a quicker change of scene.
Muslin for Costumes
The costumes of the production are j
â–  also practically complete. They have |
j been made by students under the direc- j
tion of Mrs. Helen Green, assistant to i
the course, from the designs of Mr. |
Goldner. Unbleached muslin has been
used almost entirely for these cos- \
tunics and has been cleverly treated to I
suggest far more costly materials.
In making sets the students of Mr. j
Goldner's group had no practical ex
perience when they began work under |
his direction, and they were further 1
hampered by the fact that there were j
more women than men in the group. I
j However, the feminine members have j
j shown themselves to be in no way in- J
ferior to the men in energy and ability ;
and work has progressed rapidly. Mr. !
Goldner has been much pleased both j
with the work of the class and with the j
interest and willingness that they have
shown from the very beginning.
Difficulties Overcome
Many difficulties were encountered in
staging the production. The small size
of the Assembly Hall stage was not a
difficulty, but the lack of off-stage I
space was. This will make the task of j
the amateur stage-hands much more
! difficult. All of the group v/ill have a 1
j hand in the task of scene-shifting, and i
I a few of them will appear as actors in
the cast.
Mr. Goldner has had a distinguished
career as stage designer, costume de
signer, and maker of marionettes. He
came to Stanford from the San Diego
i Fair where he spent seven months as
art director for two of the fair's greatest
buildings, the California State Building ,
and the Palace of Education. He also
! assisted in the design and decoration of
other buildings.
