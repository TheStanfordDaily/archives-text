# Social Liberty Submerged By Dictatorships
## Dr. Goldenweiser Points Out The Disadvantages Of One-Man Rule Government in United States Is Relatively Stable 
### 
"We have a mild but potential dic
tatorship in the United States today,"
declared Dr. Alexander Goldenweiser
in his lecture on "Dictatorship or Dem
ocracy," last Tuesday evening.
Speaking to an audience of 50, as
sembled in the Little Theater, Dr. Gold
enweiser stated that while we have the
vestige of a dictatorship, a reversion
to Fascism or any of the other "isms",
cannot bo accomplished without a
revolution. A revolution, he continued,
only comes about when conditions arc
extremely intolerable, and a complete
change of government in this country
does not seem very probable.
Tracing the rise of European dicta
torships, and attributing their success
to the lesson of unprecedented cen
tralized control taught during the war,
he pointed out that the economies of a
dictatorship are achieved at the cost
of personal liberty.
Liberty Sacrificed
"Dictatorship rests on guns—it must
be defended," he affirmed. It exacts
obedience and conformity and, in the
words of the U.S.S.R., nonconformists
are "liquidated." Difference of opin
ion must not exist, he declared.
Bringing up the question of whether
dictatorships prepare the people for the
future freedom promised by the dic
tator, Dr. Goldenweiser strongly held
to the negative, stating that this type of
government cultivates a slavish manner
of obedience, and relinquishing of
power to the central authority.
Democracy Untried
Attacking the charge that democ
racy had failed, he declared, "Democ
racy cannot have failed, for democracy
has not been tried. We live in a coun
try with a democratic tradition, but not
a democracy." Holding that the first
duty of a democratic government is to
fit the people for self government, he
pointed out that no existing democracy
has done this.
"We shirk our social duties," he said,
"and those duties plus a realistic per
spective of the social scene are what
we should impute to the child." He
maintained that we could achieve the
unified success of dictatorship, without
loss of liberty, by an intelligent and
comprehensive system of education.
Pointing out that the social sciences
have been neglected in the school cur
riculum, he urged that an understand
ing of the primary factors which con
trol human groups be added, even at
the cost of neglecting other subjects.
Teachers' Responsibility
"It is the irresponsibility of the many,
not the evil of the few, that is the
cause of our present problems, and the
future depends on the teacher as the
single means of imputing that respon
sibility to the incoming members of
society," he concluded. He feels that
through education, directed by a pro
gressive staff of teachers, we can even
tually achieve a real democracy and a
balanced social system.
An open forum was held after the
lecture, and Dr. Goldenweiser answered
questions from the floor. Dr. Golden
weiser was introduced by Professor
Philip E. Keller of the sociology de
partment.

trol human groups be added, even at
the cost of neglecting other subjects.
Teachers' Responsibility
"It is the irresponsibility of the many,
not the evil of the few, that is the
cause of our present problems, and the
future depends on the teacher as the
single means of imputing that respon
sibility to the incoming members of
society," he concluded. He feels that
through education, directed by a pro
gressive staff of teachers, we can even
tually achieve a real democracy and a
balanced social system.
An open forum was held after the
lecture, and Dr. Goldenweiser answered
questions from the floor. Dr. Golden
weiser was introduced by Professor
Philip E. Keller of the sociology de
partment.
"We have a mild but potential dic
tatorship in the United States today,"
declared Dr. Alexander Goldenweiser
in his lecture on "Dictatorship or Dem
ocracy," last Tuesday evening.
Speaking to an audience of 50, as
sembled in the Little Theater, Dr. Gold
enweiser stated that while we have the
vestige of a dictatorship, a reversion
to Fascism or any of the other "isms",
cannot bo accomplished without a
revolution. A revolution, he continued,
only comes about when conditions arc
extremely intolerable, and a complete
change of government in this country
does not seem very probable.
Tracing the rise of European dicta
torships, and attributing their success
to the lesson of unprecedented cen
tralized control taught during the war,
he pointed out that the economies of a
dictatorship are achieved at the cost
of personal liberty.
Liberty Sacrificed
"Dictatorship rests on guns—it must
be defended," he affirmed. It exacts
obedience and conformity and, in the
words of the U.S.S.R., nonconformists
are "liquidated." Difference of opin
ion must not exist, he declared.
Bringing up the question of whether
dictatorships prepare the people for the
future freedom promised by the dic
tator, Dr. Goldenweiser strongly held
to the negative, stating that this type of
government cultivates a slavish manner
of obedience, and relinquishing of
power to the central authority.
Democracy Untried
Attacking the charge that democ
racy had failed, he declared, "Democ
racy cannot have failed, for democracy
has not been tried. We live in a coun
try with a democratic tradition, but not
a democracy." Holding that the first
duty of a democratic government is to
fit the people for self government, he
pointed out that no existing democracy
has done this.
"We shirk our social duties," he said,
"and those duties plus a realistic per
spective of the social scene are what
we should impute to the child." He
maintained that we could achieve the
unified success of dictatorship, without
loss of liberty, by an intelligent and
comprehensive system of education.
Pointing out that the social sciences
have been neglected in the school cur
riculum, he urged that an understand
ing of the primary factors which con
trol human groups be added, even at
the cost of neglecting other subjects.
