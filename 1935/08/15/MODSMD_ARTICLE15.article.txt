# Newspapers As Texts
## 
### 
'I ho latest word in education is "fusion." Our modern friends
in education say that we must present life as a whole to the child.
At the same time, educators, along with other citizens, roundly
denounce the newspaper as a force of evil in the community. Vet
they must admit that the publishers of the nation's newspapers
were originally "fusers." They early mastered the art of spreading
information in a way suitable to all classes of our society, something
that even our most modern school has failed to do.
I here is no question hut that the newspaper sometimes exerts
an impure influence. This very fact gives point to the problem of
teaching our society as it really exists. Our newspapers are a defi
nite part of any "life" we attempt to portray accurately.
Those who criticize the newspaper would do well to analyze the
other textbooks they use before being too caustic. It is doubtful if
any paper has the time deliberately to distort social conditions to
flic extent that the authors of some texts have. Certainly the publish
ers of the dailies could rake up some pretty poor specimens of accu
rate reporting in history texts used by our schools today.
Rather than direct a continuous stream of invective against the
daily, the public and the schools should use the newspaper as the
most up-to-date text-book available in a course seeking to acquaint
the student with the current world and its problems.â€”B. A. L.
