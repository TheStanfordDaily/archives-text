# RIALTO RAMBLINGS

### 
LOS ANGELES—This city is just as
hot, just as sticky, just as muggy as
San Diego. Bad luck in the form of a
heat wave dogs the Rambler still. An
gelenos say the terrific heat of the
last few days has "abated." Abated,
my eye! If this is cool, I'd hate to be
in this mucilaginous inferno when it's
hot! Me for God's country (Paly to
you)!
Our one-day's stay in this city does
n't allow us to see and hear all the
orchestras and shows we'd like to, but
we hope «to get in a quick gander at
Eddie Duchin and Jimmy Grier before
leaving for New York. Which reminds
us to add to "Casted Shadows" the
following note: Benny Goodman's or
chestra opens at the Palomar here on
August 21, with nightly broadcasts over
KFRC.
THE MOON GOT OVER: CBS sound
effects men worked overtime recently
trying to perfect the simulation of a
bull-frog's croak. The nearest they
could get was a sound like a cricket's
chirp, yet that croak was necessary for
one of the sketches on Kate Smith's
hour. Suddenly Kate herself stepped
up to the microphone during x-ehearsal.
"How's this?" she asked. And she
uttered her idea of a croak. It was
perfect.
DIS 'N' DAT: (Sunk to the level of
stealing & caption from Walt Christie
on the Call) —Fred Allen, now making
a picture in Hollywood, says that city's
skyline has so many red neon signs
that it looks like Broadway with vari
cose veins . . . Max Baer, according to
"Variety," will make a picture in Eng
land . . . Jack Hylton is coming over
to lead an American orchestra. But
he must pay a stand-by leader, says
the American Federation of Labor . . .
George Gershwin demands $50 foi
each and every performance of "Rhap
sody in Blue."
SHORT STORY: A certain foreign
actor, seeking entry to this country,
came to that portion of the application
blank which asked whether he was
married, single, widowed, or divorced.
The actor bracketed all four together
and said, "Yes."
Will Irwin '98 originated the famous
"Give 'em the axe" yell in 1896.
