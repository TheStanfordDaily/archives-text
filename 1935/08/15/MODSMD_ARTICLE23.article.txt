# VALUABLE TUDOR BOOKS ARE LOANED TO SHAKESPEARE EXHIBIT IN LIBRARY
## Reynolds Lends 'Chronicles' Used by Playwright For Plots 
### 
Loans to the Shakespeare exhibit at
the art gallery by Dr. Harry Reynolds
and Mr. David Keeble have shared
honors with the great show of modern
paintings in the first gallery. Dr.
Reynolds sent out for exhibition at the
end of last week a 1577 edition of Holin
shed's "Chronicles, which occupies a
place of distinction in the large show
case near the entrance to the middle
galleries. The volume is not only val
uable for its use by Shakespeare as or\e
of his chief plot-soux - ces but also be
cause it reveals much of the history of
printing.
The quarto itself is printed in black
throughout, in the clear type to which
we are accustomed; but the leaves orig
inally used to pad the cover have been
loosened by the dilapidated state of the
volume, and show a considerably earlier
printing method. The pad page comes
from a black-letter volume, in the sim
ple old Gothic letters. At the head of
each paragraph is a colored capital—all
the capitals on the page being in dif
fering colors. Within each is a precise
lower-case letter.
The whole shows how loath book
makers were to leave off the beauties
of hand-decorated and written manu
cripts.
Oddly enough, manuscript work was
decaying so fast that even while this
method was preserving some of its
characteristics, its real value was al
most nil. In the case beside Dr. Rey

nold's volume there is a sixteenth cen
tury page of decorated manuscript, the
letters being cramped and slanting, and
the floral decoration feeble and unimag
inative, with no sense of design.
Mr. Keeble's loans to the exhibit are
two excellent Hanfstaengel prints of
Holbein's drawings, and two eighteenth
century engravings illustrate Falstaff
scenes from Henry IV—from drawings
by the famous caricaturist Henry Bun
bury, a friend of Goldsmith and Dr.
Johnson.
