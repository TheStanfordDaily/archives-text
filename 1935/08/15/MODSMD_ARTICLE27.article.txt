Worked by the native Indians for the
cinnabar ore with which they painted
their bodies long before the Spaniards
came to California, the New Almaden
Mine became the second largest and
richest quicksilver mine in the world.
Later, in the 1870's and 80's, these vast
deposits of ore caused Almaden to be a
thriving community of 6,000 people. So
rich in historical lore, one should not
fail to visit this mine, which is little
over an hour's drive from the campus.
In 1777 when the Spanish padres built
the Mission Santa Clara they learned
from the Indians of the red earth that
would make red paint, and they used it
in adorning the mission. The San Vi
cente Ranch, on which the New Al
maden Mine is located, was granted to
Don Jose Berryessa in the early settle
ment of this valley by Don Luis Ar
guello, governor of California, for Ber
ryessa's services as his secretary. Ber
ryessa in 1824 was the first white man
to discover the mine.
When General John C. Fremont and
Kit Carson passed through San Jose,
they visited the mine, and Fremont re
ported to the United States government
that the mine was worth about $30,000;
but within four years it was earning
$25,000 annually.
During its prime as many as 1000
men were employed at the mine, 80
miles of tunnels were dug ,and 16 fur
naces run. For several years it has been
inactive; but whether this famous old
mine has been exhausted or there is
still lurking in its depths other vast
stores of wealth, no one knows.
The constitution of the A.S.S.U. first
appeared in 1894.

The Crocker Art Gallery in Sacra
mento contains the largest and most
valuable collection of art treasures
west of Chicago.
