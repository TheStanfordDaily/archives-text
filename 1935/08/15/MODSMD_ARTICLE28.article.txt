# Women Top Men in Grade Points; Japanese Club Makes High Average
## 
### 
If you notice a supeiuor and slightly
patronizing look on the faces of Stan
ford women don't be surprised. They've
got a right to wear it!
Stanford women students have again
triumphed over the lordly male in grade
points. Despite an increase of 300 in
their ranks and the removal of com
petitive restrictions on admission of
women students, which resulted in a
halving of last year's lead over the
men's group, the fair sex stil! has a safe
majority on scholarship.
Latest figures from the registrar's
office show that the women's ratio of
grade points to registered units is 2.64.
The men's ratio is 2.52. In comparison
of fraternities and sororities the dif
ference is even more marked. Sorori
ties show a ratio of 2.82, while the
men's organizations have a rating of
2.4 G.
The highest rating for women's resi
dence groups goes to the sororities,

and the highest individual sorority rat
ing is awarded to Delta Gamma, whose
ratio is 2.89 with an enrollment of 42.
Highest ranking men's group is the
Japanese Club, which tops Delta Gam
ma's ratio by one point, being 2.90.
Only a few of the women's residence
groups rate below those of the men.
These figures are for 1933-34, last
year's being not yet available.
