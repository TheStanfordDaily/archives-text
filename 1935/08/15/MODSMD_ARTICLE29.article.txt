# ED.D. CANDIDATES RECEIVE DEGREES AS QUARTER ENDS
## 
### 
The School of Education announces
that six candidates have successfully
passed the oral and written examina
tions for the Master and Doctor of
Education degrees this quarter.
Each candidate has had a committee
appointed to sponsor him and check
his work in preparation for the tests.
This committee acts in an advisory
capacity, assisting the student in map
ping out his courses and aiding him in
his research problems.
Each candidate must be prepared to
take a written examination in two or
three fields in which he indicates his
interest. These tests are somewhat
shorter than the seven-hour written
examination he must take in his field
of concentration.
Upon the completion of the written
tests, the candidate is subjected to an
oral examination in which the entire
faculty of the School of Education has
the privilege of questioning him.
Following the successful completion
of all these tests, the student proceeds
with his work on his thesis. Ordinarily
he will have finished all his course work
before the examinations.
These students have completed the
tests:
For the doctor of education degree—
Lacey A. Eastburn, secondary educa
tion; Wilbur Moser, general adminis
tration; Gladys Relyea, science educa
tion; Audley Robert Kennedy, general
administration; Archie M. Turrell,
guidance and personnel.
For the master of education degree—
Ruth Grimes Sumner.
