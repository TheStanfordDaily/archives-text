# Is Men's Attire Influenced By Stanford Girl?

Is it co-education that makes Stan- j
ford men dress well?
So Professor Willis H. Johnson is I
wondering. The professor came to I
Stanford last week to join the biology i
department, where he will take over i
biology courses 1, 2, and 3.
"I came here from Wabash College, j
Indiana," the professor says. "At Wab- !
ash the students have a sort of tradition â– 
against dressing well. They go about J
in old clothfs, often unshaven, and j
make no effort to look neat. Naturally, i
one of the first things I noticed was j
the appearance of the Stanford men. j
Perhaps co-education is the answer."
Professor Johnson is very enthus- j
iastic over his new position. He is espe- 1
cially pleased with the size of Stanford,
t which he declares is ideal.
"It is neither too large nor too small," \
he explains. "At the University of Chi- 1
i cago, where I did graduate work, the
classes were so large that any personal
, contact between students and profes- j
j sors was impossible. I like to know my j
I students and to have them know me. i
S Only with a fairly small class can this |
| be done."
In comparing Stanford with the Uni
i versity of Chicago, Dr. Johnson referred |
to the size of the latter's campus with
I some surprise.
"The University of Chicago," he
pointed out, "has about 12,000 students.
Yet Stanford seems a much larger col
! lege. This is due to the large size of its I
j campus and the spacious buildings, j
Eastern universities tend to have much
j smaller campuses."
Dr. Johnson has been at Wabash Col
j lege since 1925 as a professor and re- j
I search worker in protozoology. His wife
and infant daughter will join him early
I in September. House hunting has taken
up most of Professor Johnson's time
! since his arrival.
His trip from the East was made by
motor and was without incident except
| for the excessive heat encountered
! while crossing the desert, which Dr.
Johnson declared was the worst he had
ever experienced.
