# 36 Men Needed For Gardening
## 
### 
Since those days when the founder
drove his fashionable carriage down
Governor's Lane and through the Ar
boretum, the care of the Stanford cam
pus grounds has slowly grown to a 36-
man job.
One of these men, familiarly known
as "Harry, the perpetual motion man,"
follows the power mower over the 200
acres of lawn on the Farm. When he
has completed one of his two-day trips
over the grounds, the grass is already
grown and ready to cut at the place
where he first started and Harry is off
again behind his whirling blades. If he
works at full speed he is able to cut the
lawns twice each week.
Busy in Summer
The gardeners are especially busy
during the summer in irrigating the
grounds, which require about 2,000 gal
lons of water from Searsville each day.
Besides caring for the grounds, these
men plant over 1,000 trees and shrubs a
year. They were recently called upon
to move a distant grove of five-ton olive
trees to a place near the new women's
gym. No job is too big for the Stanford
gardeners, who have moved trees so
heavy that they broke a spring on a
five-ton truck.
In only a few other places in the
world is it possible to grow the wide
variety of plants as may be seen in the
Stanford Arboretum. Almost all plants
of the temperate and tropic zones flour
ish here. Some come from little known
parts of the earth and are valued at sev
eral hundred dollars. It was in this
world famous botanical garden that
Senator Stanford dreamed of building a
palatial mansion in which to spend the
rest of his life where he could be close
to the University of which he was the
father.
On Job 40 Years
A few of the men working as gard
eners on the University grounds orig
inally worked for the founders. Henry
Maier, the head gardener came to work
for the University about 40 years ago
after being in the Royal Gardens at
! Stuttgard, the grounds surrounding the
palace of King Karl of Wurttemberg.
' Karl Maier, his nephew, has been work
ing in the nursery since the infancy of
I the school.

during the summer in irrigating the
grounds, which require about 2,000 gal
lons of water from Searsville each day.
Besides caring for the grounds, these
men plant over 1,000 trees and shrubs a
year. They were recently called upon
to move a distant grove of five-ton olive
trees to a place near the new women's
gym. No job is too big for the Stanford
gardeners, who have moved trees so
heavy that they broke a spring on a
five-ton truck.
In only a few other places in the
world is it possible to grow the wide
variety of plants as may be seen in the
Stanford Arboretum. Almost all plants
of the temperate and tropic zones flour
ish here. Some come from little known
parts of the earth and are valued at sev
eral hundred dollars. It was in this
world famous botanical garden that
Senator Stanford dreamed of building a
palatial mansion in which to spend the
rest of his life where he could be close
to the University of which he was the
father.
On Job 40 Years
A few of the men working as gard
eners on the University grounds orig
inally worked for the founders. Henry
Maier, the head gardener came to work
for the University about 40 years ago
after being in the Royal Gardens at
! Stuttgard, the grounds surrounding the
palace of King Karl of Wurttemberg.
' Karl Maier, his nephew, has been work
ing in the nursery since the infancy of
I the school.
Joseph Spaulding, who used to exer
cise Senator Stanford's prize colts, is
1 still taking care of his old employer and
; never fails to put flowers on the Mauso
! leum twice a week.
Since those days when the founder
drove his fashionable carriage down
Governor's Lane and through the Ar
boretum, the care of the Stanford cam
pus grounds has slowly grown to a 36-
man job.
One of these men, familiarly known
as "Harry, the perpetual motion man,"
follows the power mower over the 200
acres of lawn on the Farm. When he
has completed one of his two-day trips
over the grounds, the grass is already
grown and ready to cut at the place
where he first started and Harry is off
again behind his whirling blades. If he
works at full speed he is able to cut the
lawns twice each week.
Busy in Summer
The gardeners are especially busy
during the summer in irrigating the
grounds, which require about 2,000 gal
lons of water from Searsville each day.
