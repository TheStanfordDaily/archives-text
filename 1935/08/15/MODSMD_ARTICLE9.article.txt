# MODERN GERMAN AUTHORS PRODUCE NEW LITERATURE
## 
### 
"We should be willing to let the Ger- I
; man people work out their own prob- !
lems in their own way," said Profes- j
! sor Thomas M. Campbell, visiting pro
j lessor of German literature, in an intcr
j view here today.
While Professor Campbell does not
! agree with all the activities of the !
Nazi regime and personally prefers a j
democratic government to any form of
dictatorship, he still feels that the po
! litical activities of Germany are the !
problems of the German people alone. ;
Nationalism Not New
In discussing the effects of the Nazi ,
government on German literature, he
j stated, "While the present government !
i has taken over the control of literary ;
j papers and exercised a favorable cen- j
i sorship, the leaning toward nationalism
j in literature such as is noticeable un
! der the Nazi regime is by no means
j new in Germany."
He finds a tendency on the part of
j German writers to recall the literary
j figures of the nationalistic movement in i
i Germany during the Napoleonic Wars. <
Artists also stress this nationalistic
; background, he declared.
I The New Germany which is not co-
I extensive even in time with the pres
-1 ent political regime, is producing a
i somewhat different type of character
| in its literary works. This is well dem
! onstrated by the stories of Hans Grimm,
| in which the characters are symbolized
|as persons hardened to the realities
!of life. This characterization replaces
| the rather romantic and bookish symbol |
| formerly presented to German youth. !
Enjoying California
A professor of German literature at
j Northwestern University, Professor !
! Campbell is greatly enjoying his first '
i visit to California. He expected to find |
I a more tropical area, he admitted, and ;
was disappointed until he saw the palm
I trees on Palm Drive.
j The author of a number of books on 1
' German literature, outstanding of i
j which are "The Life and Works of j
Frederick Hebbel," "Hebbel, Ibsen, and
j the Analytical Exposition," Professor i
! Campbell is giving three courses this j
| summer on various phases of the lit- 1
j erature of Germany.
