# MacGill, Irish Poet, To Tell Story of Life
## Wife of Playwright To Read Verse As Supplement To Lecture Author's Formal Education Limited to 3 Years 
### 
The well-known Irish poet and play
wright, Patrick Mac Gill, will lecture
tonight at 8 o'clock in the Little Theater
on the story of his life. Supplement
ing his talk, Mrs. Mac Gill, an actress
trained under the great Sir Henry
Irving, will read several of her hus
band's poems.
Mr. Mac Gill's books have been trans
lated into 13 languages, and his plays
have been produced on this continent
as well as in England. His best known
book is "Children of the Dead End"
and deals with the sordid side of life.
On the same subject is another of his
works, "The Rat Pit."
Mr. Mac Gill is eminently suited to
tell and describe this side of life, since
he worked as a common laborer in
many different fields between the ages
of 12 and 19. His total formal school
ing amounts to three years at a moun
tain school, but at 21 he joined the
editorial staff of the Daily Express.
Mrs. Mac Gill has just returned from
Sweden, where she was invited to read
before the Anglo-Swedish Society in
Stockholm at the society's meeting in
celebration of King George's Jubilee.
This was no new experience for her,
as, in addition to her renown as an
actress, she is well known as a lecturer
and reciter of modern British poetry.
This talk, which is expected to be of
particular interest to the students in
the course in Shakespearean produc
tion, will begin promptly at 8 o'clock.
