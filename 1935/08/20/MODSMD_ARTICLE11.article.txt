# American Cities Resemble Japanese, States Visitor
## 
### 
America is exactly like Japan.
Miss Shizu Ishikawa, instructor at
the First Girl's High SchooJ of Tokio,
I and a member of the Japanese good
I will student tour, was much disap
| pointed over the resemblance.
| "I don't know exactly what I ex
pected American cities to be like," she ;
j declares, "but I certainly thought they
jwould be utterly different from those
|of my native country. However, except
I for the difference in the inhabitants,
any American city I have visited so far
could well be a Japanese city. The
buildings, the street cars, the automo
biles, are all exactly like ours."
Modernization has been rapid in
Japan, she explained, and all the de
vices of our western civilization have
been adopted. Only in the remote dis
tricts do the old ways survive. Young
Japanese men and women have adopted
[ western dress and western customs.
"The one difference I notice," Miss
Ishikawa says, "is that your American
| cities all seem to be very much alike,
j In Japan we try to make each city
! different by adopting a distinctive ar
! chitectural style, but I can hardly tell
1 one of your American cities from an
| other.
i The hospitality of Americans was an
; other thing that reminded Miss Ishi
kawa of her native land. Everyone she
: meets here, she says, tries to make her
feel at home. This is also a tradition
| of the Japanese.
"In many foreign countries," she
points out, "the people are aloof and
unfriendly. They make you feel like
an outsider. But in America you put
aside formality and treat your guests
as if they belonged here. I do not feel
] like a stranger at all."
