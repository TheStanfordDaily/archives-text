### 
Carrying messages of good will and
friendship from far-off Japan, 50
young men and women from leading
Nipponese universities came lo Stan
ford Sunday for a two-day visit.
Headed by Professor Sugimori of
Waseda University, Tokyo, the group
arrived here after attending the Amer
ican-Japanese Conference at Port
land, Oregon, and making a tour of the
Pacific Coast.
"Our only regret," Professor Sugi
mori said, "is that we have not more
time to spend in seeing the beauties of
your famous University which has
graduated so many great men. Our
allotted time is really too short.
Group Praises Stanford
His sentiments were echoed by the
entire group. "We should have liked to
have seen everything," said Masashi
Kato, their chairman. "Your facilities
here are amazing. Japanese universi
ties are very small and can not afford
the marvelous equipment and beautiful
buildings such as you have at Stanford.
We envy you for your swimming pools,
basketball courts, class rooms, libra
ries, and your art museum.
"In Japan," Kiyoshi Goto, on the ex
ecutive committee of the Japan Eng
lish Association, added, "we are over
crowded."
"The Japanese people," Mr. Goto
went on, "like Americans and want to
understand them. We are all deeply
interested in American culture and
American life. We wish that Ameri
cans could be persuaded to take an
equal interest in our country, especially
in its music and art."
Interested in English
The Japanese interest in the Ameri
can language is also great, according to
Goto. Almost every Japanese boy and
girl has a desire to learn English. In
all conferences they take it for granted
that the language spoken will be Eng
lish.
The hospitality shown them during
their stay here greatly pleased the
group. "We have been shown great
kindness and courtesy wherever wu
have gone on our tour," Mitsura Mura
kama of Doshisha College of Commerce
declared. "Our reception at Stanford
was outstanding."
Open house was held for the students
Sunday afternoon by Professor and
Mrs. Payson J. Treat and Mrs. David
Starr Jordan. After a buffet dinner at
(he Japan Student Clubhouse, coffee
was served at the home of Mrs. Herbert
Hoover. Here many of the Japanese
young men and women wore their
beautiful and picturesque native cos
tumes.
Monday morning was spent in view
ing the Stanford campus. Lunch was
served them at the Stanford Union by
the University. They left at 1:30 o'clock
for San Francisco.
Acquaintances Renewed
During their stay here some of the
group renewed acquaintance with sev

The students of the group were se

tions.

lish Association, added, "we are over
crowded."
"The Japanese people," Mr. Goto
went on, "like Americans and want to
understand them. We are all deeply
interested in American culture and
American life. We wish that Ameri
cans could be persuaded to take an
equal interest in our country, especially
in its music and art."
Interested in English
The Japanese interest in the Ameri
can language is also great, according to
Goto. Almost every Japanese boy and
girl has a desire to learn English. In
all conferences they take it for granted
that the language spoken will be Eng
lish.
The hospitality shown them during
their stay here greatly pleased the
group. "We have been shown great
kindness and courtesy wherever wu
have gone on our tour," Mitsura Mura
kama of Doshisha College of Commerce
declared. "Our reception at Stanford
was outstanding."
Open house was held for the students

beautiful and picturesque native cos
tumes.

group renewed acquaintance with sev
eral Stanford students who visited
Japan last year on the American stu

"Our only regret," Professor Sugi
mori said, "is that we have not more
time to spend in seeing the beauties of
your famous University which has
graduated so many great men. Our
allotted time is really too short.
Group Praises Stanford
His sentiments were echoed by the
entire group. "We should have liked to
have seen everything," said Masashi
Kato, their chairman. "Your facilities
here are amazing. Japanese universi
ties are very small and can not afford
the marvelous equipment and beautiful
buildings such as you have at Stanford.
We envy you for your swimming pools,
basketball courts, class rooms, libra
ries, and your art museum.
