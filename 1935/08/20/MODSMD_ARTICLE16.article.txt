A few days ago the whole world was shocked by the report of
the tragic death of Will Rogers, To the world he represented much
of that which is America. His easy and pleasant wit charmed the
world. Much of really profound philosophy escaped his lips while
seeming to jest. He contributed a great deal to the enjoyment of
life for the average American.
Will Rogers was the lovable character we knew because he had
the faculty of extracting the element of humor from the most
prosaic and commonplace things. When great men took themselves
a bit too seriously he could make them turn and smile at them
selves. He made no pretentions to being an artist yet we know
how much of an artist he really was. There was nothing super
ficial about Will Rogers, he was human to the core.
Throughout his colorful career, from the days he did rope tricks
for Ziegfeld to his emergence as America's favorite motion picture
personality, Will Rogers was a man beloved by nil of his associates.
Unoflieially he was a significant contributor to international good
will, and in America his daily article, syndicated in 117 newspapers
throughout the nation, was a reliable mirror of public opinion.
We shall miss Will Rogers greatly. We shall miss his cheerful
voice on the airwaves and on the screen. There will be a deep gap
in every newspaper in which his pertinent comments were once
printed.
The name of Will Rogers will have a permanent place in the
annals of the really great—and of course, human.
