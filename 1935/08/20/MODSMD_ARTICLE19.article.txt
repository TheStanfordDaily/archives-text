# School Declared Bulwark Against Irresponsibility
## 
### 
: The nation's schools are among the
â–  ' strongest bulwarks we have today
' ! against loose thinking, loose living,
. j cynicism, and social irresponsibility, j
i President Glen Frank told the 1,500
, ! young men and women who graduated 1
i | or received higher degrees this year i
J from the University of Wisconsin at
! the annual baccalaureate services held j
|in the University Field house. He
spoke on "The University Idea in the
Life, of the Time." In the course of his
talk he said:
"If every graduate of every Ameri
can university, in his adult participa
tion in the life of his time, functioned
|as an informed and aggressive pro
, ponent of the university idea, the na
tion's universities would be less affected
than they are by the assaults of ig
norance, malevolence, and special
j pleading."
Under the old Mosaic law, the sen
tence of death was carried out for
cursing one's parents.
