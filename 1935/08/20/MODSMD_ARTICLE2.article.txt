# Reading of Play To Be Thursday
## 
### 
A fitting climax to the summer study
of Shakespeare and Tudor times will
be the dramatic reading of "Elizabeth
the Queen" to be presented by the staff
of the course in Shakespearean Pro
duction in the Assembly Hall Thursday
evening.
The choice of this play has a double
purpose, for the author, James Max
well Anderson, was a graduate student
at Stanford in 1914 and contributed
poetry to the English Club Book of
Verse during his residence at the Uni
versity.
The lead in "Elizabeth the Queen,"
Mr. Anderson's best play and perhaps
the best play in modern times, will be
played by Dr. Margery Bailey, assist
ant professor of English. The other
members of the cast include James
Sandoe, Hugh Baker, George Z. Wil
son, Paul Crary, Thomas Seller, Robert
Cat heart, and Chester Barker. The
feminine members of the cast will be
Claire Sisson, Edith Harmon, and Elsie
Werthman.
Masks of comedy and tragedy will be
presented on the same program. The
masks are constructed by Orville Gold
ner, who is noted for his work in the
current Shakespearean productions.
Preceding the reading will be an ex
hibition of 16th ccntury Morris and
Sword dancing by the classes of Mrs.
Margaret Barr and Miss Marie Man
chee.
The program will start at 8 o'clock
and admission will be 25 cents.
