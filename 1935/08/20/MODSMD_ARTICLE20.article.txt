NEW YORK—We take back what we
said about liking bumpy air. The trip
from Los Angeles was plenty rough.
Already the typical New York atti
tude has manifested itself among ac
quaintances: New York is IT; every '
place else, the sticks. New Yorkers are i
even proud of what they should be
ashamed of. They boast about their
abominable traffic whidh an intelligent j
police commissioner could easily rem
edy; and, of course, they' boast about
their heat, which is vastly over-rated. |
The day we arrived was, according to
the natives, a very hot one; yet it was
nothing in either heat or humidity |
compared to San Diego and Los An
geles.
New York is a disappointing town.
It's just another large, dirty city, not
the glamorous center of American life J
that legend has made it.
THE TRAGIC DEATH of Will Rogers
has by now been thoroughly covered
in the local papers, and there is nothing
we could add to his obituary. But his
son, Will Jr. (or Bill, as he always in
sisted on being called at Stanford) is
our idea of the man to take his father's
place. He has that same native wit,
end the same inherent talent for the
"feel" of his audience, as shown by his
recent performance in the "Follies
Bourgeois" here.
Rogers, incidentally, was preparing
to film "Ah, Wilderness" for Metro-
Goldwyn-Mayer at the time of his
death.
LOCAL CHATTER: If "Variety,"
our sole source of home news in this
distant city, is correct, Jan Garbcr
opens tomorrow night at the St. Fran
cis, and Ina Claire brings her play,
"Ode to Liberty," to the Curran next
Monday.
MORE CASTED SHADOWS: Burns

occupy the same spot in October . . .

It was not until 1929 that engineers
