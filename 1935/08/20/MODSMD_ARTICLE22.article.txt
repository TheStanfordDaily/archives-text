# DESIGN OF MEMORIAL CHURCH INSPIRED BY FOUNDER'S OBSERVATIONS IN EUROPE
## 
### 
Before building the Memorial
Church, Mrs. Stanford made a special
trip to Europe, bringing back the fin
est and most enduring art and archi
tecture available. Artists have prophe
sied that the Memorial Church will
some day be a mecca for builders and
artists in search of the most lasting
construction and coloring.
So superior is the workmanship in
this building that if it stands for hun
dreds of years, the colors in the mo
saics, murals, and art glass windows
will be as bright as on the day they
were made.
The mosaic reproduction of the "Last
Supper" in the chancel by Cosimo
Roselli is the only copy ever permitted
to be made of the famous original in
the Sistine Chapel at Rome. Mrs.

Stanford decided to feature this typo
of decoration after being fascinated by
the unfading brilliance of the mosaic
work she saw in Italy.
This memorial . . erected to the
Glory of God and in Loving Memory
of . . . Leland Stanford" was partially
destroyed in the earthquake of 190(5.
The tower and chimes fell and the or
gan and Carrara marble statuary were
ruined. The walls were so severely
crpcked that it was necessary to prac
tically rebuild the structure.
In the reconstruction each stone was
securely bolted to its neighbor and
now the Stanford Memorial Church is
an almost indestructible shell of stone
and steel standing with its ever bril
liant facade in lasting memory of the
"Father of the Youth of California."
