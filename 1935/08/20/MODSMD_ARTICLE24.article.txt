# Old Airplane Engine Given To Wisconsin University
## 
### 
A 10-cylinder radial engine, the
work of an inspired inventor who was
dreaming 20 years ago of being able
to give his invention to his country
as a valuable aid in winning the World
War, now rests—a memorial to lost
hopes—in the mechanical engineering
building on the University of Wisconsin
campus.
The inventor, after having searched
for and finally found a financial backer,
began work back in the winter of
1915-16 in an attempt to reduce the
weight per horsepower of aeronau
tical engines. The idea was to make
fighting and scouting planes more effi
cient and give them increased cruising
ranges, vitally important in those early
days of aeronautics.
Records show that the proud de
signer and hopeful financial backer
brought the resultant 10-cylinder rad
ial engine to the State University to
take advantage of laboratory equip
ment in testing its expected 150 horse
power output and general mechanical
durability.
But so drastically had the weights
of all parts been reduced that the
crankcase was not left strong enough
to withstand forces developed in the
cylinders. The engine made only a
half dozen revolutions before the
crankcase split to pieces, in spite of
peculiar tie-rods placed as an after
thought to keep the crankcase from
heaving.
Last year women comprised more
than one-third of the Stanford Student
Body.
