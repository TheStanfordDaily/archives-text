One of the last milestones in the jour
ney of the Cross from Mexico to Alia
California is Mission de los Dolores, in
San Francisco. This venerable old
building differs from the other mission
architecture in that it is a combination
of Moorish, Mission, and Corinthian
styles.
The interior of the chapel, practically
untouched by time, is of particular in
terest. The alter, the most ornate of
the missions, was brought from Spain,
as were the original decorations and
paintings. No nails being at hand, the
Indian converts painted the rafters in
crude patterns of red, white, yellow,
and blue, and fastened them together
with rawhide thongs which are intact
today.
The tiles covering the roof, the sun
dried adobe bricks of the four-foot
walls, as well as the hand-hewn tim
bers, were all fashioned by the Indians
under the direction of mission padres.
The inscriptions on the shadowed
monuments of the little graveyard ad
joining the mission carry much of the
early history of California. Here
among other notables, rests Don Luis
Antonio Arguello, first Mexican gov
ernor of California.
