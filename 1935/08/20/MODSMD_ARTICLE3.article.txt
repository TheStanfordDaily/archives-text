# CAMPUS GAS BUGGIES Outrun Mounties in '90's SPEED LIMIT 15 M.P.H.
## 
### 
When automobiles first appeared on
the Farm, the eampus police of 20
years ago developed remarkable accu
racy in guessing the speed at which a
car was travelling. Riding horses and
bicycles, it was sometimes impossible
for them to overtake hurrying roughs
dashing hither and yon over the Uni
versity grounds in their high-powered
gasoline buggies which were capable of
the terrific speed of more than 20 miles
an hour.
To simplify this traflic problem, it
became the custom to arrest drivers on
the campus who looked as if they were
j traveling more than 15 miles an hour
j on the charge of disturbing the peace,
i Ed Fogarty, one of Stanford's ear
j liest galloping policemen, has become
famous in the history of the University
for keeping his horse in such good con
dition that he was often able to gallop
faster than the offending students; but
as automobiles improved, he too was
forced to resort to mental arithmetic to
estimate the speed of the collegiate
social lion who was rushing his date to
old Roble just before the last ding of
the 2:30 o'clock lockout.
Now, two decades later, the situa
tion is quite changed. Recently equip
ping two cars with short-wave radio
sets, Stanford has today one of the
most modern university police forces
in America and a high rating as a
well regulated campus.
