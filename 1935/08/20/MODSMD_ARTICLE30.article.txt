# NEEDY CHILDREN GET FUNDS FROM S.M. HORSE SHOW
## Convalescent Home To Get $2148 as Medical Aid For Three 
### 
A year's medical aid for three needy
childrenâ€” This is one of the results
of the San Mateo County National
Horse Show, sponsored by the Atherton
Auxiliary of the Stanford Convalescent
Home, when the final receipts were
totaled. The show, given two weeks
ago at the Menlo Circus Club in Ath
erton, netted the Auxiliary $2148, which
will be turned over to the Convalescent
Home on the campus. This amount will
be sufficient to keep three under-privi
leged children at the Home for a period
of one year.
Approximately 21,000 people saw the
nine performances of the show, and
according to Mrs. Willard Sheldon, sec
retary of the Auxiliary, '"It was a grand
success."
The automobile raffled off by the
Auxiliary, in connection with the show,
was won by Dr. T. R. Creely of San
Francisco.
