Q. Where is the Jordan home?
A. Next door to Sequoia Hall is an
apartment house for the faculty, and
just beyond that is the Jordan home.
Q. What was the story about the
horse's having all four feet off the
ground when galloping?
A. In 1877, photographic experiments
were made to see whether or not a
horse did have all four feet off the
ground at the same time during an in
stant of galloping. Senator Stanford
held that he did, although the point
was much disputed. Results of the
photography proved conclusively that
Occident, the horse used in the experi
ment, did have all his feet in the air at
once. Senator Stanford was delighted,
not only because it proved him to be
correct, but because of the consequent
development in photography. That was
the beginning of the present motion
picture system, for Stanford assumed
that if one picture could be taken
instantaneously, why not an indefinite
number, and by increasing the number
of cameras increase to the same extent
the number of views, and illustrate
the various positions of the entire
stride. Further experiments were held
with more cameras and increasing
equipment by a skillful photographer,
Muybridge, with momentous results
and benefits to the entire motion pic
ture industry.
Q. Is it true that the Chapel had a
steeple originally?
A. Yes, when the church was built
there was a steeple constructed over
the altar. The earthquake of 190G,
however, transformed the edifice into
a mass of wreckage, and in the re
building the steeple was left out.
Q. When did Senator Stanford die?
A. On June 20, 1893, Senator Stanford
died of paralysis of the heart, and now
the "University stands as an enduring
monument to the largeness of heart
and creative instinct of its founder, and
to his good will toward all mankind."
