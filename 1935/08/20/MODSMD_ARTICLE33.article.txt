# Professor Gives Views on Math

### 
"Higher mathematics is a purely
spiritual thing and like music and art
is regarded by the mathematician as
an end in itself and not as a practical
science," says Professor Gabriel Szego
of Washington University, St. Louis,
now lecturing in mathematics at Stan
foxd for the summer quarter.
Professor Szego came to America a
year ago after teaching for a time in
several German and Hungarian tech
nical schools.
In speaking of arousing the student's
interest in mathematics, he says: "Some
properties of numbers and geometrical
figures will interest anyone if he is
stimulated in the proper way. The
teacher must be capable of viewing the
topic from a high standpoint and has
to have an intuitive feeling for the per
son who is learning. Any college stu
dent can leam the more fundamental
forms of mathematics if he has a good
teacher."
