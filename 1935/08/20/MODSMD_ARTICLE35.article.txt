Strange interview—with United Air
lines Stewardess Olive Hamilton and
Pilot John Crain, shouting in the in
terviewer's ear 10,000 feet up in a
speeding air transport.
Miss Hamilton pointed out that the
turnover in air stewardesses is very
rapid. The job is almost a sure way to
get a husband, for statistics reveal that
most of the girls who enter the service
leave it to marry within six months or
a year after they first take the air.
Requirements for an air stewardess,
Miss Hamilton said, are that she must
be not over 5 feet 4 inches in height,
weigh less than 120 pounds, and be
between 21 and 27 years of age. Bru
nettes predominate by over 2 to 1.
Pilot Crain, an ex-air corps officer,
has been flying seven years, 4 on air
lines, and one and a half on the San

Francisco-Los Angeles run. He is a i
graduate of the University of lowa,
where he was a Kappa Sigma.
"Planes are becoming safer but get
ting harder to run," he says. "There
are about 115 separate controls and in
struments in this ship," he said, point
ing to a bewildering maze of them on
the instrument panel in front of him.

The mosaic- reproduction of the "Last
Supper" in the Memorial Church is the
only copy ever permitted to be made
of the famous mosaic in the Sistine
Chapel at Rome.
Stanford has had more world record
holders in the pole vault than in any
other athletic event.
