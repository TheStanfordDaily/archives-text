## 
### 
The work of the Shakespearean de
partment for the summer quarter was
climaxed Friday and Saturday eve
nings by the successful presentation of
"Othello." The audience on both
nights was large and appreciative.
William Thornton, director of the
course in Shakespearean production,
appeared for the first time in the role
of the Moor. His presentation was con
vincing and showed his ability for por
traying Shakespearean characters.
Desdemona, as portrayed by Annelies
Morgan, was a delightful person. Miss
Morgan has a fine voice and used it
well both in her spoken lines and in
the singing of the "Willow Song."
Sydney Head in the role of lago gave
a splendid performance, one that show
ed him to be an amateur of real prom
ise and one acclaimed by San Fran
cisco critics.
Amelia Baines' portrayal of Emilia,
the serving wench in the service of
Desdemona, was a fine one. Other
members of the cast ably supporting
Thornton were William Gwinn as Cas
sio, Clifford Mattox as the Duke of
Venice, Edward Bode as Brabantio,
Richard Lewis as Roderigo, James
Sandoe as Montano, Helen Gunderson
as Bianca, Edward Bode as Ludovico,
Margaret Fish as a Herald, David
Brown as Gratiano, Andrew Morth
land and Charles Young as soldiers,
and George Wilson as a senator.
The production held particular in
terest as it was the first a 11-campus
presentation at Stanford. Both the
scenery «nd costumes were made as a
part of the summer's course. The set
as planned by Orville Goldner, tech
nical director in the Shakespearean
department, was a unit set which pre
sented a great deal of versatilty in
scenes. There were nine scenes in
all and each one was decidedly effec
tive.
The costumes, made of inexpensive
materials, gave a delightful bit of color
to the production as well as authen
ticity. They were made by the students
in the course in costume design under
the direction of Mrs. Helen Green.
