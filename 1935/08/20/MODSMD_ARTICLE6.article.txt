mer will give the last of the Tydor lec
tures on Wednesday evening at 7:30
o'clock in the Little Theater. The sub

Modernity of Shakespeare."
Dr. Taylor has devoted a great deal
of study to the subject of what the
Elizabethans thought in matters of
metaphysics, psychology, and religion
in order to understand what Shake
speare's characters thought and be
lieved.
Dr. Taylor pointed out in advance
of his talk that many modernists think
Shakespeare couldn't get beyond his
time and really believed that which all
Elizabethans believed.
Wednesday evening Dr. Taylor will
ask his audcnce to consider the prob
lem of whether or not Shakespeare did
have ideas in advance of his time.
Dr. Taylor has taught English at the
University of North Carolina since
1925.
