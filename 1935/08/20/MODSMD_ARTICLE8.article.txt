# Curiosity Brings Death To Black Widow Spider
## 
### 
Minnie, the, black widow, was playing
"Man on the Flying Trapeze" from a
rafter in the Assembly Hall Thursday,
while Orville Goldner's stage design
class was rushing last-minute prepara
tions for "Othello."
Minnie hung from her web and
watched sets being assembled, costumes
being brought in and final touches be
ing made to armor and stage furniture.
Finally, Minnie lowered herself on a
spinneret (that's what spiders lower
themselve on) and tried to sec the
work at closer range.
"I think she's a black widow!" some
said.
"No!" said others.
The "black widow" proponents won
their argument by pointing out Min
nie's glossy color and called attention
to the little red hour-glass she wore.
So Minnie was executed, and the class
resumed work.
During the greater part of their lives
after founding the University, Senator
and Mrs. Stanford directed everything
concerning it.
