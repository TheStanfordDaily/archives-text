I One can well realize the skill neces- 1
j sary to create these quaint products of
i Navajo art when he sees the colorful
| sand paintings standing in the lobby
1 of the Stanford Museum. Two of these
! paintings were done especially for the
1 University by visiting Indians. The
third was obtained by the museum
j after the medicine man who created
it finally quieted his superstitious fear
1 of leaving the painting undestroyed at
sundown, by sprinkling pollen over the
j face of the figure.
j These sand paintings, which are a
j part of Navajo religious ritual, are over
I 20 feet square when used in the an
j cient art of ceremonial prayer. A sand
painter is schooled from childhood in
j his art and is taught to pour pinches of
colored sand in a clean straight line
j from between his thumb and fore
! finger.
j On the morning before a ceremony,
; the medicine man climbs to the top of
the "Sacred Mountain" and after a
! short prayer to the Sun God fills
pouches with different colored sands,

returning to the medicine lodge, where 1
the painting is begun on the freshly 1
cleaned floor exactly at 1 p.m. After 1
the ceremony the painting is always j
destroyed, for it is a part of Navajo !
superstition that misfortune will come j
to the tribe if the painting is left to i
stand in darkness.
