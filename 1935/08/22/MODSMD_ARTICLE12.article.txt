# Mears Praises Quarter Here; Tells of Plans
## Men from Foreign Colleges Will Be on Faculty Next Year Drama and Music Programs Planned for 1936 
### 
With this year's summer quarter
considered highly successful, plans are
already being formulated for next
summer, Dr. Eliot G. Mears, director of
summer quarter, declared today.
Stating that the visiting faculty this
summer was larger than any since
1929, he pointed out that the bringing
of scholars to Stanford furnishes the
student a wide contact from which to
absorb the culture and knowledge of
other centers of learning.
A large visiting faculty will be
brought to Stanford again next sum
mer, he declared. The members of the
summer faculty for 1936 will be an
nounced during the fall and winter as
the appointments are ratified by the
Board of Trustees. Dr. Mears said a
special attempt is being made to bring
men who are noted in their field, espe
cially those from foreign universities.
Education Plans Made
Plans are being laid for a School of
Education conference on curriculum
and guidance following the one on
educational administration held on the
campus this year, July 8 to 13. This
conference drew many nationally fa
mous men and women in the field of
education, and it is hoped that next
summer's educational activities will
surpass even this quarter's successful
program.
It is hoped, also, that a program of
chamber music will be arranged for
next year. It was through the kind
ness of Mrs. Elizabeth Sprague Cool
idge that the Pro Arte quartet was
again brought to the Memorial Church
this summer. Attendance at their con
certs showed a 50 per cent increase over
1934, Dr. Mears said.
Discussing other unusual aspects of
this summer quarter he cited the
course in Shakespearean production
i under the direction of William Thorn-
I ton. This group successfully created
| the scenery and costumes, and pro
duccd "Othello" in the Assembly Hall
one week ago. In the field of art and
literature, he also mentioned the Tudor
lecture series which brought to the
student vivid word pictures of Eliza
bethan times. These lectures were
| given by outstanding authorities on the
| subject of Tudor times.
Record Number of Visitors
1 Five thousand persons visited the
I exhibition of European paintings held
, in the Art Gallery in conjunction with
the course in art appreciation, given
this year for the first time. The gal
lery also held an exhibit of Shake
i spearean relics of the Elizabethan
I theaters.
The Tuesday evening lecture series
brought students the benefit of discus
j sions on contemporary political, social,
and economic problems, by members of
the faculty.
i With attendance at Stanford this
summer increased 15 per cent over last
j year, an even larger enrollment next
year is anticipated, Dr. Mears con
cluded.
A variety of new courses is being
added yearly, and summer quarter at
! tendance in the future promises* to
surpass the high mark set in the sum
mer quarter of 1929.
