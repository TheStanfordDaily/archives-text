After seeing the Italian fishing fleet
at Fisherman's Wharf, one realizes San
Francisco's cosmopolitan nature. These
fishermen are entirely Mediterranean,
both in their rapid speech and their
costumes of woolen tarns, loose trou
sers, and high rubber boots, as they go
about their work of mending nets or
unloading the day's catch. Thursday is
the best, time to visit this quaint little
harbor, because the catch for Friday is
the largest of the week.
Following the Embarcadero toward
the Ferry Building the visitor passes
Meiggs Wharf, from which the cus
toms* and immigration officials dash out
to meet incoming ships.
A short distance to the west of Fish-
erman's Wharf is the new Municipal
Pier, a favorite spot for lazy fisher
men, where catching striped bass is
merely a matter of throwing a line into
the water and pulling it out again.
Along the waterfront may be seen
ancient and weather-beaten sailing
ships lying in the stream.
On the docks, all of which are owned
by the state, giant cranes are unload
ing the products of many distant lands.
The waterfront is steeped in romance
and a few hours' chatting will bring
weird tales of foreign lands similar to
those written by Robert Louis Steven
son and Jack London from men to whom
the world is more than a colored map.
