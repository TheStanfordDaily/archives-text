NEW YORK —Wired radio, hinted at
for years and a reality in Belgium for
the last six anntims, has arrived in the
U.S. at last. Set to start in Philadel
phia, the system, which uses either
power or telephone lines, provides three
different channels of non-commercial
programs from 7 a.m. to 1 a.m. the fol
lowing morning at a daily cost of from
5 to 15 cents, depending on *the type of
receiver, which is rented, not bought.
One channel will provide a steady
diet of dance music, the second oper
etta, vocal, and light orchestral, and the
third will be a hybrid carrying sym
phonies, news, lectures, and educational
stuff. Most programs will be high
fidelity transcriptions, with more big
names than you could shake a whole
faggot of sticks at. In Belgium and
Holland, 66 per cent of the population
subscribes to the wired radio system
and relies almost exclusively on it for
home entertainment.

NEW YORK —Wired radio, hinted at
for years and a reality in Belgium for
the last six anntims, has arrived in the
U.S. at last. Set to start in Philadel
phia, the system, which uses either
power or telephone lines, provides three
different channels of non-commercial
programs from 7 a.m. to 1 a.m. the fol
lowing morning at a daily cost of from
5 to 15 cents, depending on *the type of
receiver, which is rented, not bought.
One channel will provide a steady
diet of dance music, the second oper
etta, vocal, and light orchestral, and the
third will be a hybrid carrying sym
phonies, news, lectures, and educational
stuff. Most programs will be high
fidelity transcriptions, with more big
names than you could shake a whole
faggot of sticks at. In Belgium and
Holland, 66 per cent of the population
subscribes to the wired radio system
and relies almost exclusively on it for
home entertainment.
