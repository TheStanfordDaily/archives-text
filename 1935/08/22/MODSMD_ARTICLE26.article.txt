# Yard Machinist Creates Violins
## 
### 
! George Corwin, mechanist in the
Corporation Yard and an accomplished
amateur violinist, has fulfilled a long
cherished desire to create his own in
struments. In 1932 he made his first
violin after two years' work daring his
spare time. Since then Mr. Corwin has
finished two more violins and is now
working on his fourth with a growing
ambition to build a 'cello.
"Violins are like people. Every one
has a different voice and ic is impos
sible to make two (hat are identical,"
explains Mr. Corwin. He is an omni
verous reader of literature dealing with
stringed instruments, but the only in
struction he has ever received in the
art of constructing them was through
carefully observing an old violin maker
many years ago in Ohio.
