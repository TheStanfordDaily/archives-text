# GOLDNER PRAISES EXPOSITION PLANS

San Francisco's exposition in 1938
will be one of the most successful
world fairs ever held.
This is the conclusion of Mr. Orvillc
Goldner, instructor in stage design for
the course in Shakespearean produc
tion. Mr. Goldner came to Stanford
from the San Diego fair, where he de
signed two of the fair's most important
buildings and assisted in the design of
others.
''The San Francisco fair will differ
from other recent ones in that it has
a real purpose," Mr. Goldner says.
The completion of the two huge bay
bridges will be one of the most im
portant engineering feats in modern
times, he points out. The San Fran
cisco exposition will not only be a
splendid celebration of this achieve
ment, but it will be held on Yerba
Buena Island, which is between the
two bridges and in plain view of them
both.
"The site is of vital importance to a
fair," Mr. Goldner explains. "The
beauty of the San Diego exposition is
largely due to its attractive location."
The Chicago fair of 1933 had no such
advantages, he said. It was constructed
on built-up land along the lake front
and had neither trees nor fine land
scapes to beautify it. It was forced to
depend on novelty and modernistic ef
fects to attract its crowds.
The San Diego fair, on the other
hand, has a fine setting with thousands
of beautiful trees surrounding it. Its
architecture is a blend of Spanish and
early Californian and harmonizes with
the setting.
"I believe," says Mr. Goldner, "that
it is a much greater artistic success
than the Chicago fair. The latter was
larger, of course, but not so attrac
tive."
The San Francisco exposition, located
on Yerba Buena Island with the pano
rama of the Marin hills as a background
and employing the same type of archi
tecture that made the Panama-Pacific
fair famous, should be even more at
tractive, he believes.
