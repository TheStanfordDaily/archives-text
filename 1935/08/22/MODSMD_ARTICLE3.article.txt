# MODERN PHYSICS ALTERS METAL BY ATOMIC CHANGES
## Dr. Lloyd P. Smith Explains Changing of Elements In Vacuum 
### 
Ancient alchemists sought for the
philosopher's stone, which they believed
would transform base metal into gold.
Modern science has at last solved their
problem.
Dr. Lloyd P. Smith, acting assistant
professor of physics at Stanford, says
it is now possible to disintegrate atoms
of one element into atoms of other
elements. This modern scientific magic
is done not with the philosopher's stone
but with high velocity projectiles.
"Atoms of an element," explains Pro
fessor Smith, "are placed in a vacuum
and are there bombarded with the nu
clei of hydrogen. One million electron
volts are required to break down the
atoms." Professor Smith added that the
speed obtained by this current is ap
proximately 10,000 times the speed of
the average atom in the air.
Physics, accordmg to Professor
Smith, is by no means the terrifyingly
mathematical science that some sup
pose it to be. Complicated mathema
tics are necessary only for advanced
work. Any average student who is
willing to apply himself can easily
keep up with the elementary courses.
Professor Smith comes to Stanford
from Cornell Univex-sity, where he has
been since 1932.
