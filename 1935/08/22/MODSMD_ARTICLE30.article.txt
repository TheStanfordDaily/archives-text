# MITCHELL REPORT ON CAMPUS REGISTRATION REVEALS FIGURES ON STUDENT ENROLLMENT
## Student Attendance Shown To Be Steadily On The Increase 
### 
Approximately one out of every
three students you see on the campus
at the beginning of an autumn quar

This and other interesting data is

report showed. Lowest ebb of fresh

then the number has steadily in
creased until the 1933-34 figure was
553.
Total enrollment for that year was
3,975, which marked an increase of 117

quarter showed a gain of six. The
number of old students was less than

Mitchell's figures. In there
were 1,532 of these tests given at 58
centers in the United States. Almost
half of these test centers were in Cali
fornia, the rest being distributed over
the country as far south as the Ha
