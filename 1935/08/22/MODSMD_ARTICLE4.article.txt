# SUMMER SURVEYING TAUGHT BY THOMAS, ONLY CLASS OFFERED DURING SEPTEMBER
## 
### 
Professor Earl C. Thomas, of the civil
engineering department, is looking for
ward to conducting the only class on
the Stanford campus during the whole
of September. This is the summer sur
veying class which is offered each year
during the interval between summer
and autumn quarters.
"I enjoy my work with this course
very much," Professor Thomas says.
"The students are always very much
interested in our work, as there is not
the distraction of other courses to con
tend with. The students all live to
gether during the month, and we are
like one big family."
This situation is somewhat compli
cated this summer by the fact that
women students are becoming inter
ested in the course, and some may reg
ister for it this summer. Professor
Thomas isn't exactly sure just what
arrangements he will make in that case.

"Because of the necessity of an early
breakfast," he says, "our students are
usually housed in one place. We begin
work at 6 o'clock every morning since
we are unable to work during the noon
day hours and want to get in as much
time as possible before then. The heat
waves of midday make our work very
difficult."
Most of the month's work, Profes
sor Thomas explained, will be the sur
veying of roads and highways and of
the topography of the country behind
the campus.
"In spite of the early hours," he de
clares, "my students always seem to
enjoy themselves. We have a lot of
fun, even though we do work at least
8 hours every day. Owing to the fact
I that our course is only four weeks long
while the others are 8- and 10-week
j courses, we have to keep busy."
Regular registration for the class be
-1 gins on Monday morning. Work will
I begin immediately thereafter,
j Among those students who have
! made tentative arrangements for the
| course are Charles Lippman, James A.
i Nelson, William T. Spencer. Nelson B.
Davis, Phillip J. Prescott, Eldridge M.
Fowler, M. J. Van Loben, John Silli
] man, Robert W. Cahill, and Welton C.
i Smith.
I Other registrations will be made on
Monday. The course is intended pri
i marily for upper division students, but
it is expected that graduate students
| will also apply.

Professor Earl C. Thomas, of the civil
engineering department, is looking for
ward to conducting the only class on
the Stanford campus during the whole
of September. This is the summer sur
veying class which is offered each year
during the interval between summer
and autumn quarters.
"I enjoy my work with this course
very much," Professor Thomas says.
"The students are always very much
interested in our work, as there is not
the distraction of other courses to con
tend with. The students all live to
gether during the month, and we are
like one big family."
This situation is somewhat compli
cated this summer by the fact that
women students are becoming inter
ested in the course, and some may reg
ister for it this summer. Professor
Thomas isn't exactly sure just what
arrangements he will make in that case.

"Because of the necessity of an early
breakfast," he says, "our students are
usually housed in one place. We begin
work at 6 o'clock every morning since
we are unable to work during the noon
day hours and want to get in as much
time as possible before then. The heat
waves of midday make our work very
difficult."
Most of the month's work, Profes
sor Thomas explained, will be the sur
veying of roads and highways and of
the topography of the country behind
the campus.
"In spite of the early hours," he de
clares, "my students always seem to
enjoy themselves. We have a lot of
fun, even though we do work at least
8 hours every day. Owing to the fact
I that our course is only four weeks long
while the others are 8- and 10-week
j courses, we have to keep busy."
Regular registration for the class be
-1 gins on Monday morning. Work will
I begin immediately thereafter,
