# Carre Given Professorship At the Sorbonne in France
## Old Prophesy Comes True; Now He Cannot Joke About It 
### 
j Dr. Jean-Marie Carre won't be able
; to tell one of his favorite stories any
| more. The joke has turned into fact.
The audience who attended Dr.
Carre's lecture on Egyptian life last
month heard him tell about the friend
who heralded his coming to Egypt by
telling all the newspapers that Dr.
Carre was a professor of the Sorbonne
I and would be dean of the School of
Letters at the Royal University of
Cairo. When the doctor remonstrated,
his friend replied, "Oh, that's all right.
: Some day you will be a professor of
| ihe Sorbonne and also dean of the
I School of Letters."
Prophesy Comes True
It never occurred to either Dr. Carre
or his listeners that this story con
! tained a prophesy. Yet even while he
was telling it his appointment to the
t Sorbonne was being planned in Paris.
And yesterday he learned that he had
| been chosen as professor of compara
tive literature there.
"I haven't been officially notified
| as yet," Dr. Carre says. "The informa
tion came by cablegram. But I am sure
I that it is correct."
He will assume his new duties at
the Sorbonne about the first of Novem
j ber and is sailing for Paris on the
French Line at the end of this quarter.
