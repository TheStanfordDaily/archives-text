# SHAKESPEAREAN WORKS MODERN, SAYS DR. TAYLOR
## 
### 
''Although Shakespeare is, of course,
always to be studied as of his own age,
if we are to understand him and to
really interpret him, there are never
theless to be found in him, expressed
by his characters, many attitudes
toward life which are singularly like
our own," said Dr. George C. Taylor
last night in the last of the Tudor
lectures.
Dr. Taylor's talk, which ended the
series of lectures given this summer in
connection with the course in Shake
spearean production, was on "The
Modernity of Shakespeare" and was
presented in the Little Theater.
The present tendency is to deny that
Shakespeare had ideas like our own,
according to Dr. Taylor, but careful
study shows this to be untrue. Shake
speare was both intensely modern and
at the same time distinctly of his own
age.
Dr. Taylor, who has taught English
at the University of North Carolina
since 1925, has devoted a great part of
his life to the subject of Elizabethan
thought regarding metaphysics and
psychology and is considered an au
thority on that subject .
