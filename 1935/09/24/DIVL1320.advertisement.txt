Dollars to Burn?
O Maybe the dough-heavy college playboy of your
father's time could burn his twenty-dollar bills
to make a big impression on his latest flame, but
it's a lot different today. You college student*
must spend your allowance wisely and make
every dollar count.
# That is the reason we recommend that you
patronixe DAILY advertisers. Without excep
tion they are merchants who keep up with th«
modern business trends and are prepared to
give you the greatest value for every dollar you
spend.
