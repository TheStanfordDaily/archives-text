# Charging Indian in Daily Nameplate Sets Keynote for Revision of Policy
## 
### 
Spread before a refreshed and returning
student body this morning is the first edition
of Volume <S<S of the new Stani oiuj Daily, a
volume of the paper which starts the new
school year with a revised formal, staff, and
policy, geared to keep abreast of the changing
university.
Setting the kepnote for the alterations is
the charging Indian in the background of the
paper's name at the top of the front page,
denoting action in a new vein.
'I he changes in the type dress were made
after a careful examination of the existing
conditions, it was felt that the new type dress
presented a cleaner looking, more inviting,
easier t<Â» read, more effective newspaper.
The Daily plans the allotment of the right
ful amount of space to each activity as the
news of tlie day warrants in relation to the
other subjects represented in the edition. Pub
licity will be handled with the view in mind
that the Daily is a publication for the student
body.
Letters to the editor, which will run under

' the column heading of "Vox Campi," will be
edited for unnecessary details and will be re
jected unless a signature, which need not run
if the writer so indicates, is present. Rejec
tions to the column will also be made in cases
where the correspondence is strictly dealing
1 maliciously with personalities.
The Daily, as previously, intends to ac
knowledge the existence of politics on the
campus, giving a concise, fair presentation of
the news regardless of the nature. Above all,
however, an attempt will be made to maintain
harmony between the various groups on the
I campus. Criticism is reserved for situations
where that harmony is disturbed.
National and world news will be handled
in skeleton form as best suited for a campus
paper with stress on campus angles. This will
I be particularly true of editorial comment.
Volume 88 of the Daily sets out, therefore,
to present a campus newspaper particularly
stressing local news displayed fairly, not for
getting the place of national news in the
j set-up.
