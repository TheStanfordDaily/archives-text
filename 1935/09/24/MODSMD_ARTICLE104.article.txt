# And Now With the Improvements Come . . .

### 
Stanford's usually pessimistic track coach,
Dink Tcmpleton, recently remarked that his
Indians can beat Southern California next
year and possibly win a national champion
ship or two.
II requires but little imagination to trace
Teniplcton's unexpected optimism to the fact
that Ancient Angcll Field has been repaired,
and in a short time will rank among the finest
training plants in America.
The alterations, advocated by the Daily last
spring, will be complete and accurate in every
detail. The new Angcll Field, made possible
by a $2."),000 appropriation voted by the Hoard
of Athletic Control early in July, will have a
smooth, springy track, an ideal drainage sys
tem, hard take-oils and soft pits for the jumps,
and improved facilities for weight men.
Slight drizzles will no longer make it im
possible for Indian runners to get the neces
sary training of carJv season pratcice; pulled
muscles and shin splints will be real accidents
and not just habit among Cardinal track stars,
and prospective track athletes wil no longer
be frightened away from enrolling at Stanford.
