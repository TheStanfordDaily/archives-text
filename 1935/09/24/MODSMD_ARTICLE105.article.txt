# It's Welcome and "Hello"
## 
### 
In the Farm's reluming student body arc
the many newcomers, to whom Stanford oilers
a cordial welcome and manifold attractions.
There is no need lor a newcomer to the cam
pus to crawl into a corner and shrivel up, or
worm into the library and hibernate.
To lrosh, Stanford a fiords independence,
freedom of action in a marked degree, a
chance to spread their wings, to grow up and
follow the many Stanford men who have gone
before and are successful living life in all its
phases.
Cordiality has always been a Stanford trail,
just as has democracy. The "hello" tradition
is the most noticeable outcropping of this
I rail.
The Stanford man—and woman—may, and
is expected, to say "hello" to anyone he hap
pens across on campus, whether friend, ac
quaintance, or stranger. Obviously, the cus
tom is more used when individuals meet on a

I lonely walk than in the postollice at noon
rush.
Whether the I'rosh has eome to the Farm
to study, to learn, to participate in any of a
I seore of activities, to make friends, or just to
; mature inconspicuously and 'efficiently, he
| is not likely to he disappointed. Stanford's
! field is diverse.
i Transferring students will he amazed at the
freedom of action here, and the welcome they
will he accorded hy old-timers. Transfers arc
j not treated as though they had just stepped
into an isolation ward.
! It's welcome and "hello."
