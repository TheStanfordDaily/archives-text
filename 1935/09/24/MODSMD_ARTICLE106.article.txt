After sitting on the fat of the land all summer,
Our Hasher returns to the pots and pans, the trays,
toots, and twirps, and the sinks of moral leprosy.
A probe by Our Hasher of students registering
yesterday reveals that even the slump in railroad
stock is no excuse for signing up so many of so little.
The prize butch of the season has been committed
already by some of the now-extinct Class of '38. It
appears President Wilbur was having a dinner Sunday
night for some of the student big shots. During the
middles of the meal, there same a loud banging at
the door. The maid opened it, and three sloppy
looking frosh stepped in. Shouted they in the ap
proved Kabelaisan manner: "Bring on the Wimmen."
The astute gentlemen retired in utter rout after
finding that the resemblance of the President's Home to
a woman's dormitory (Roble) being purely accidental
and not such a great resemblance at that, after you
get back and give it a good look, eh laddies? Well, it
might have been the Kappa Sig house.
Which reminds me that all the wildcat building
hither and yon on the campus makes .it look as if
somebody struck oil—or the alumni. The Delta Gam
ma First National Bank, Stanford Branch, is now ex
pecting to receive deposits of nuggets, but they ne
glected to install fortifications, bullet-proof glass, and
a machine gun nest on the Phi Delt exposure.
Reports that the Kappa Sigma house has received
several offers from gasoline companies who want a
choice service station .site, are unfounded. The Kappa
Sigs will burn their own midnight oil, they claim.
And in it they intend to burn Our Hastier. Sorry,
but Our Hash is only open for engagements for roast
ing on coals during the fall season.
Delta Chi has done its bit to contribute to Life's
Fresh Air fun, while Thcla Chi is bemoaning the fact
that the Thetas are singing: "Annex doesn't live here
anymore."
But, in spite of it all and all, I figger that the jani
tors are all set to pledge the best boys. (Look at all
the duty rnshiii ' they do every day in Eneina).
