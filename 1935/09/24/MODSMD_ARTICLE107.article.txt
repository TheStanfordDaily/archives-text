# Women Fail to Faze It
## 
### 
Although the increasing number of women
has changed many Stanford traditions, the
Honor Code remains this year as before. Few
universities in the country find it possible to
operate under this system, hut Stanford has
maintained it with almost no flagrant viola
tions and a minimum of minor ones.
Favored hy a majority of the faculty and
I supported hy the student body, the major
problem is only that of acquainting newcom
ers with the operation and tradition of the
code.
Professors have no policing function in ex
aminations on the Farm. They arc entirely
out of the room, remaining in their offices and
holding themselves ready to perform their
more suitable function of answering ques
tions.
Written work handed in for grades at any
time is expected to be the student's own, not
' his roommate's, house brother's, nor author
' Illurp's. An extension of the code also covers
library books, which arc of more use to the
student body undefaccd and unstolen.
The workings of the code arc simple. There
are no incessant harangues, no necessity for
perpetual snooping from above, no need for
! constant conspiracy below.
All that is required is a little decency, com
mon sense, and the word of a Stanford genlle
! man signing the pledge:
! "No unpermitted aid given or received."
