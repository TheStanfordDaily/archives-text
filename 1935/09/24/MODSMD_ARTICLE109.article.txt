## WHY, FRESHMEN, WHY? 
### 
Why arc they here . . . these thou
sand or more freshmen? . . . Why
for broader views of life . . . new
interests . . . poise . . . richer ca
pacities for enjoying life!

Don't ask one of this class of '39
why he came to college. He couldn't
quite tell you. But those who back
up the new checks made payable
to Stanford University can give a
reason why their offspring are sent
forth to college. They give a careful
ly thought-out answer, because in
the proccss of compounding an hon
est sounding reason, they were
forced to do some careful thinking.

> Once an inspired institution actu
ally asked a huge slice of college
parents what they expected their
children to derive from college. A
full half million, idealistic, baffled,
or unwilling with the truth, com
pounded the formula — broader
views, new interests, poise, richer
capacities for enjoying life. One
hundred thirty-two expected train
ing for earning a living. Sixty-eight
expected formation of friendships.
A bold one named participation in
college sports. Another, honest and
hopeful, wanted a husband for his
daughter. And two, dark souls they
were, expected nothing.

i From the above recital one gath
ers that American parents arc as
toundingly sane. Nobody cxpectcd
his child to get an education in col
lege. That, apparently, is out of the
question. The question is: "broader
views of life," to be obtained from
four years of association with per
sons not old enough to be citizens
and a Quad full of academic minds;
"new interests" which may emanate
from Mcnlo, Roble, or the an
nouncement of courses; "poise" to be
cultivated at well-mannered jolly
ups and around the carefully con
ducted dining boards of Hall and

Row; "richer capacities for enjoying
life'" afforded by Saturday after
noons in the stadium, week-ends at
Carmel, the Concert Series, the end
of the mile-and-a-half limit, and
Wednesday evening lectures.

Knowing what parents expect
makes it possible to deliver the
goods. So next vacation expound
broad views — defend Mussolini's
policy. Profess new interests —talk
with gusto about those afternoons in
biology lab. Display poise—pump
the citizens' hands like a fraternity
man. And enjoy life—don't yawn
over the bridge table when the rela
tives have dropped in.
Parents don't expect much. They
shouldn't be disappointed.
—John McClelland
