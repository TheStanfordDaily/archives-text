j "SPECIAL AGENT"
At the Stanford Theater
BFor a G-man picture,
"Special Agent" is surpris
ingly good, since it is a little
shorter on improbabilities
than the average. Subtle and fairly
effective propaganda against racket
j eers, shysters, and gambling dens
, rears its head now and then, with a
boost or two for Uncle Sammie in
serted rather unobtrusively.
Plot and dialogue are nothing spe
cial, but smooth direction and flaw
less acting by all principals and the
three stars—George Brent, Bette
Davis, and Ricardo Cortez—puts the
.show in the entertaining class.
| ' RUNAWAY QUEEN"
Also at the Stanford
Flhis is the kind of show
that makes single bills a
pleasure. There is no pos
sible excuse for its exist
ence; there can be no explanation.
If you go to this double bill, ar
range to miss this English flop, or
go to hear the Rough's bright cracks.

If there are no cracks, the slow
tempo or the loud music will drive
you goofy. Phew!
