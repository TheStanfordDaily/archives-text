# Broncos Seen As Stanford's Chief Barrier
## Huskies, California, St. Mary's Will Be Other Sectional Leaders Sania Clara Heavy 'Stub's' Bear Sophomores May End on Top 
### 
Coast football authorities agree
almost unanimously on one thing
this season — Stanford is the only
logieal team to take the top spot in
far western football competition for
'.935. For once the old war-scarred
Indian has the situation right under
his tomahawk and there aren't many
who dispute his potency.
But beyond that one point of
common belief there is much con
flict of opinion, Washington' Santa
Clara, St. Mary's, California—
these four have the dopemen
puzzled as to what teams might
l»e classified as second best, and
which, of those that play Stanford,
might possibly upset the Cards.
To pick just for the picking sake,
Santa Clara receives this vote for
ihe second position, disregarding the
fact that the Broncs are a non
conference outfit.
Sparkled in Scrimmage
Here is a team with a backfield
averaging 195 pounds per man, able
to pass, kick, and run, in fact, do
everything about as well as it can be
done. Here is a massive line and
enough men to pile every position
at least six deep.
Last Saturday Santa Clara mowed
through her freshman team, and the
Bronc frosh are said to be even big
ger and burlier than Stanford's Pa
pooses. They passed and lateraled
and ran their way to six touchdowns
to a single one for the freshman.
Huskies Will Be Threat
Jimmy Phelan's Washington Hus
kies are going to be heard from, too.
Last year they caused Stanford a
lot of worry until Bobby Grayson
intercepted a pair of passes to score.
They might cause some apprehen
sion again this season.
Washington is reported to have
lost most of its strong line, but Phe
lan has a habit of bringing some
mighty fine outfits out of the north
west.
California, minus its great
triple-threat Arleigh Willifms,
might come through despite this
loss. A powerful frosh team of
last year his joined Stub Allison's
squad of 17 returning Icttermen
and the 1935 Bear team is begin
ning to take definite shape.
