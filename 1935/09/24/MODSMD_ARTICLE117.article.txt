# Card Cage Star In L. A. Hospital
## Infection Settles in Dinty Moore's Shoulder 
### 
The opening of fall basketball
practice finds Stanford's 1936 chances
swinging in the balance as Captain- j
elect Bryan "Dinty" Moore remains
in a Los Angeles hospital with what
has been determined as infected
shoulder blades.
Moore spent most of tne summer j
pitching hay, and two weeks ago !
was put to bed with a fever. For |
ten days the cause of the fever was I
unknown, and the length of time it
will make an invalid of the star j
guard had not been determined at
a late hour yesterday.
Last season Sophomore Dinty j
Moore, playing a guard position, led
the entire Stanford quintet in scor
ing and was elected captain for his
junior year. He won a place on
every all-conference quintet that
was named at the close of the 1935
season, and his play during the com
ing two years was counted on as a j
vital factor in Card success.
