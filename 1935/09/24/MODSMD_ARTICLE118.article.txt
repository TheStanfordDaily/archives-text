''We'll be out of the woods by
Christmas," said Sylvestre J. (Je
hosaphat) Droftnats, "and into the

This statement was delivered by
the peerless predicter of grid and
waffle iron as he emerged from
his six-months' hibernation in the
eighth hole of the golf course,
whence he retired immediately
following Stanford's remarkable

Bosc.
The next statement he whipped
out was, "what'reyatakingthisquar

When Thornhill (Coach) replied:
"Every team on the coast," the peer
predicter without peer, mumbled

"I get it," replied the coach
(stage). "What's on your mind?"
"One dash of wildroot, a little
lemon, some sugar, and just a wee
touch of whiskey. Stir thoroughly.

"San Jose is the first on the sked
and the skeds (you get it, don't
you?): 33-0 (a multiple of three).
We'll take the next Gezar at Kezar:
U.S.F., 0, Stanford, 14. After this
