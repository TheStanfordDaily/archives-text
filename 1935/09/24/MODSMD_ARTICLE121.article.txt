# Football Prices For Year Given
## A.S.S.U. Cards Good For All But Big Game 
### 
A.S.S.U. cards have more worth
as football tickets to the Stanford
|-fan this year than last, with but one
j home game of the varsity requiring
j anything more than the card for ad
i mission as against three requiring
extra last year.
.Four of the five varsity tilts in
the Stanford stadium will be free
to cardholders, according to word
from Graduate Manager A1 Mas
| ter's office. For the California
game, however, student fans will
have to reach into their cords and
purses for $1.65 in addition to
! cards.
General admission and season
j tickets have been dropped in price
; accordingly. The latter, which in
: eludes all home tussles except the
j Big Game, is selling at $3.50. This
sum represents a saving of more
than 30 per cent over buying sep
arate general admission.
