Head Coach, Stanford Football Team
Saturday afternoon isn't the only time I want to see Stanford students
watching their football team. They ought to be out there every afternoon,
getting to know the players and the kind of football we intend to dish out

inis is no invitation, it s a request. <
I want the student body to get to- I
gether with the rally committee and i
' some yell leaders and practice a
I few yells while the team practices
j ball. It'll help both parties.
| Loafing is all right, too—for the
I spectators, I mean. We have plenty
j of bleacher room.
Right off, I want you to know that
I'm speaking for the team as well as
' myself. The boys want to sec stu
dents taking an active interest in
j practice just as much as in games.
They'd really like to have everyone
in school know something of their
j system of play. It's the sort of in-
J formation that's fun in the learning,
and more fun in the knowing when
the game is under way.
I want to take this opportunity to
point out that football isn't the only
sport that needs this kind of bleach
er "body English." Basketball, base
ball and track—they're all just the
same. They all need spectator spirit.
That's something that many stu
dents consider high school talk, but
it's something a good athletic ma
chine needs as badly as good play
ers. They need a gang to let them
know they're being watched, de
pended on, and encouraged every
inch of the bitter training grind.
This last one I'm going to whisper
in your ear when you take a wan

der to our lawn-floored football lab
oratory—bring the girls.
They'll help—plenty!
