# Nation's Grid Teams Lined Up by Scribes
## 
### 
"Stanford is the team to beat."
This slogan has become accepted all
up and down the Pacific slope
among the various followers of
■ gridiron warfare.
Similarly every separate portion
of these United States has a similar
chant, amended only by the names
of the several football elevens con
! ceded to be the "tops" in then - own
little leagues.
"Silly Season" On
The annual "silly season" of foot
ball has produced much talk, sta
i tistically rated two and one-quarter
per cent factual, concerning the po
tential "top" teams in each sector. •
Leading the Midwest, which group
of schools invariably produces a
"national champion," will be Ohio
State, the moguls say. The Buck
eyes have a veteran team back from
a highly successful 1934 season,
marred only by an early season de
feat by Illinois.
Next in this portion of the coun
try will be the defending champions,
Minnesota, weakened by the loss of
a couple of ail-Americans and 13
other lettcrmen. lowa is figured to
be among the top-notchers in the
Middle West, and Notre Dame will
stage a decided boost in class in the
realm of the independents.
Pitt Hopes High
Pittsburgh, slapped only by Min
! nesota last fall, will be attempting,
and with reason, to go through un
defeated. Thr Panther will compete
with Andy Kerr's Colgate eleven for
the title of "Miss Far East." That
is unless Pennsylvania, a darkhor.se
rumored to have many potentiali
ties bordering on probabilities,
comes through even better than ex
pected.
Princeton's Tigers will carry the
colors of the aloof Big Three, but are
figured for less national prominence
than they gathered for themselves
last season.
Stanford's nightmare—the Tide of
Alabama—will be minus the serv
ices ot' one Dixie Howell and one
Don Hutson; hence will have a long
way to go in its struggle to outdo a
number of good Southern teams.
Alabama Rated Best
Be that as it may, Alabama is
still rated with the best, which in
clude Vanderbilt, Georgia, Tennes
see, Tulane, and Louisiana State, all
members of the Southeastern Con
ference. Any one of these teams,
without too much stretching of
imagination, could easily finish the
season on top.
Farther over along the Southern
boundary comes another potent
group of football players. Rice is
generally conceded to be the class of
the Southwest Conference, but the
Institute will be closely followed by
Texas, Texas Christian, and South
ern Methodist.
Kansas State and Nebraska, ha
bitually on top in the Big Six Con
ference, will have at least one more
year of prosperity, the scribes from
that portion of the nation believe,
and they will stage a large battle
among themselves, which will find
the Kansans slightly favored.

dog.

Oklahoma football officials must
pass an oral and written examina

was adopted by the Oklahoma
Coaches' Association.
"Stanford is the team to beat."
This slogan has become accepted all
up and down the Pacific slope
among the various followers of
■ gridiron warfare.
Similarly every separate portion
of these United States has a similar
chant, amended only by the names
of the several football elevens con
! ceded to be the "tops" in then - own
little leagues.
"Silly Season" On
The annual "silly season" of foot
ball has produced much talk, sta
i tistically rated two and one-quarter
per cent factual, concerning the po
tential "top" teams in each sector. •
Leading the Midwest, which group
of schools invariably produces a
"national champion," will be Ohio
State, the moguls say. The Buck
eyes have a veteran team back from
a highly successful 1934 season,
marred only by an early season de
feat by Illinois.
Next in this portion of the coun
try will be the defending champions,
Minnesota, weakened by the loss of
a couple of ail-Americans and 13
other lettcrmen. lowa is figured to
be among the top-notchers in the
Middle West, and Notre Dame will
stage a decided boost in class in the
realm of the independents.
Pitt Hopes High
Pittsburgh, slapped only by Min
! nesota last fall, will be attempting,
and with reason, to go through un
defeated. Thr Panther will compete
with Andy Kerr's Colgate eleven for
the title of "Miss Far East." That
is unless Pennsylvania, a darkhor.se
rumored to have many potentiali
ties bordering on probabilities,
comes through even better than ex
pected.
Princeton's Tigers will carry the
colors of the aloof Big Three, but are
figured for less national prominence
than they gathered for themselves
last season.
Stanford's nightmare—the Tide of
Alabama—will be minus the serv
ices ot' one Dixie Howell and one
Don Hutson; hence will have a long
way to go in its struggle to outdo a
number of good Southern teams.
Alabama Rated Best
Be that as it may, Alabama is
still rated with the best, which in
clude Vanderbilt, Georgia, Tennes
see, Tulane, and Louisiana State, all
members of the Southeastern Con
ference. Any one of these teams,
without too much stretching of
imagination, could easily finish the
season on top.
Farther over along the Southern
boundary comes another potent
group of football players. Rice is
generally conceded to be the class of
the Southwest Conference, but the
Institute will be closely followed by
Texas, Texas Christian, and South
ern Methodist.
Kansas State and Nebraska, ha
bitually on top in the Big Six Con
ference, will have at least one more
year of prosperity, the scribes from
that portion of the nation believe,
and they will stage a large battle
among themselves, which will find
the Kansans slightly favored.
