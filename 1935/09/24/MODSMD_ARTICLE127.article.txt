# Bright Stars In Summer Track
## Card Ineligible Captures European Races 
### 
Norm Bright, Stanford's stocky
| ineligible, did his press agents a
couple better this summer by tear
ing off a number of foot races that
put him way up among the world's
best and established him as number
i one seeded choice for Olympic games
: wins next year.
The red-headed Bellingham boy
first came through in the national
A.A.U. meet in July, beating Joe
McCluskey, the national cham
pion, in a tremendous .9:12 two
mile.
It was hard to believe that a man
from the West Coast could run that
far that fast, but it was nothing
for Bright.
Then he went over to Europe with
a group of American athletes under
Charley Hunter for a series of trials
against the continent's best. Over
j there Luigi Beccale, 1500-meters
; champ of the last Olympic games,
was considered unbeatable. But the
boy from the Farm came through to
pass the flying Italian in the latter's
first defeat in months.
