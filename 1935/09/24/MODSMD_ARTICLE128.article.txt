# Frosh Eleven To Put Heavy Line On Field
## Two Weeks' Practice Left Before First Game With Sacramento Practice Shows Class Backfield Averages 180, Line, 192 Pounds 
### 
The first glimpse of Stanford's
! 1935 froshman football prospects was
provided last Saturday when the In
dian Papooses engaged the Cardinal
j varsity in their initial practice
j scrimmage of tlie season.
Although the varsity pushed them
i around the field pretty much at will,
! an encouraging factor was the un
; usual heft and beef of this year's
j frosh squad.
j The so-called first string aver
; ages around 192 pounds in the line,
I with the backfield at about 180-
pound average. This is not an al
together unhealthy prospect, par
ticularly when compared to other
freshman teams.
'Heaviest Weighs 210
Pete Zagar, Washington tackle, at
! 210, and Dick Carnahan at 205
pounds holding down the other
tackle post, afford an idea of the
way things will look to opposing
linemen. Bob Shreve, 167-pound
guard of Palo Alto, is the lightest
j man in the line.
i The squad of 70 boasts prospects
from the distant Atlantic coast, from
Honolulu, New Mexico, Idaho, and
Texas. One-third of the turnout, in
fact, is made up of out-of-state boys.
One of the fastest players on the
squad is Bill Hawkins, brother of the
' former U.S.C. captain, John Haw
: kins, and Frank Alustiza's "little
: brother," Al, is also on the team.
Lines Up Team
With only one week's practice be
hind them, the freshmen look fairly
good, showing the evidence of hard
preliminary work under Coaches
Jimmy Bradshaw and John Bunn.
The use of a shift was noted in Sat
urday's workout. With two weeks of
practice yet to come before the first
frosh game of the season with Sac
ramento Junior College, Bradshaw
has lined up a tentative first team
that looks something like this:
Ends—lrving Cummings and Wal
ter Hedge.
Tackles—Dave Carnahan and Pete
Zagar.
Guards —Bob Shreve and Nat
| Guiberson.
Center—Dick Sutton.
Quarter —Ed Gamier.
Halves—Louis Veenker and Bill
Kirsch.
; Full—Wallace DeWitt.
