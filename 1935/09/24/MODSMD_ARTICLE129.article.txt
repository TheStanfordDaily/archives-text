# Templeton Sees Improved Card '36 Track Team
## Junior Transfers and New Track Expected To Boost Spirit 
### 
Maybe remodelled Angell Field
will be directly responsible, and
maybe a flock of junior transfers
and a renewed spirit among Stanford
track forces will turn the trick, but
anyway Coach Dink Templeton will
have a better cinder squad this year
than he did last year.
This startling information ema
nated from no less an authority than
Robert Lyman Templeton himself,
who takes all of the personal blame
or glory for Cardinal successes and
failures in the realm of track and
field.
Shows Confidence
And when Dink proffers a state
ment of that ilk, it is a good indica
tion the headman is either feeling
very exhuberant or very confident
of his team's potentialities.
The track team in question, which
less than 18 months ago won the
1.C.4-A. and N.C.A.A. titles—and
less than six months ago placed fifth
and tied for third in the two na
tional championships respectively—
loses some good men, gains others,
and on the whole will gain enough
in spirit, facilities, and personnel to
place it as a distinct threat, na
tionally, in this, the Olympic year.
Loses Several Stars
Losses from last spring include A1
Elackman, quarter-miler, and John
Mottram, javelin ace, both veterans
of two years' point winning in I.C.
4-A. and N.C.A.A. competition; Dud
Sales and Bill Beatrty, two other
spear tossers who earned letters;
Dave Devlin, two-miler, and Lloyd
Schween, high jumper.
But that is just about all of the
bad news. The x*emoining 18 letter
men will be back to combine with
a crop of promising sophomores and
some potent transfers who will act
as fill-ins.
Among Stanford's national and
Olympic prospects for this year will
be Sammy Klopstock, two-year vet
eran in high and low hurdles; Hum
bert Smith, flashy high-jump stand
out of last year, who was injury-in
fested late in the season; Jim Rey
nolds and Phil Levy, shot and discus
men, respectively, and Jim Kneu
buhl, a sophomore, and Ray Dean,
both sprinters.

The track team in question, which
less than 18 months ago won the
1.C.4-A. and N.C.A.A. titles—and
less than six months ago placed fifth
and tied for third in the two na
tional championships respectively—
loses some good men, gains others,
and on the whole will gain enough
in spirit, facilities, and personnel to
place it as a distinct threat, na
tionally, in this, the Olympic year.
Loses Several Stars
Losses from last spring include A1
Elackman, quarter-miler, and John
Mottram, javelin ace, both veterans
of two years' point winning in I.C.
4-A. and N.C.A.A. competition; Dud
Sales and Bill Beatrty, two other
spear tossers who earned letters;
Dave Devlin, two-miler, and Lloyd
Schween, high jumper.
But that is just about all of the
bad news. The x*emoining 18 letter
men will be back to combine with
a crop of promising sophomores and
some potent transfers who will act
as fill-ins.
Among Stanford's national and
Olympic prospects for this year will
be Sammy Klopstock, two-year vet
eran in high and low hurdles; Hum
bert Smith, flashy high-jump stand
out of last year, who was injury-in
fested late in the season; Jim Rey
nolds and Phil Levy, shot and discus
men, respectively, and Jim Kneu
buhl, a sophomore, and Ray Dean,
both sprinters.
