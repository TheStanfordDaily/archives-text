# Lindbergh Sees Rocket Invention For Stratosphere
## 
### 
ROSWELL, N.M., Sept. 23 (JP).â€”
Colonel Charles A. Lindbergh arose
at dawn today for a second study of
the strange apparatus and steel
tower assembled on the cacti-stud
ded tableland near here by Dr. R.
H. Goddard for piercing the secrets
of the stratosphere with rockets.
Lindbergh and his airplane pas
senger and intimate friend, Harry F.
Guggenheim, were believed survey
ing the experiments with a view of
determining whether the Guggen
heim family foundation would ex
tend further financial assistance.
Great Privacy
Large canvases were hurriedly
thrown over the scientific instru
ments at the approach of outsiders,
who were halted more than 200
yards from the 60-foot high rocket
tower.
Lindbergh busied himself at the
base of the tower. Friends of God
dard indicated recently he had made
progress with an automatic steering
device for his rocket.
It was recalled that the original
grant to Goddard by the Guggen
heims was for one year and began
in September, 1934.
Tests Made
Lindbergh's principal concern is
the information Goddard might,
glean on radio waves at a height of
40 to 150 miles and the relation of
this data to stratosphere fiying.
Goddard has made only prelimi
nary tests preparatory to discharg
ing his projectile, 12 feet long and
two feet wide, for research above
the clouds with inclosed instru
ments. Some smaller rockets have
been fired in years past.
