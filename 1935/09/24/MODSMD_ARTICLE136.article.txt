# "Model Track Plant" Nearly Finished
## Work Hastened On Remodeling Of Angell Field Cindermen Start Autumn Practice Immediately On Stadium Oval 
### 
Ancient Angell Field is no more.
In the spot where for 28 years
Stanford track athletes strode the
cinderpath to both victory and de
feat, a new track, as fine as any in
the west, is coming into being.
Early in July a B.A.C. appropria
tion of $25,000 started workmen
tearing up the old oval, object of so
much criticism following last year's
unsuccessful track season.
By November 1 B.A.C. officials
expect to see completed the new
layout, with turfed infield, well
packed jump takeoffs, soft pits, and
cinder covered track.
Ready in Spring
By early spring, after winter rains,
officials believe the new Angell Field
will be ready for Coach Dink Tem
pleton to turn his 1935-36 trackmen
loose to test out the best in a mod
ern track and field unit though at
this time the team will be midway
through its season.
If work progresses more rapidly
than planned, however, Dink's men
may be able to tread the new track
earlier in the cinder year. In the
meantime they will work out on the
Stanford stadium oval, beginning
immediately.
Grading Completed
At present all grading work has
been completed; the new oval cut
nearly two feet lower than the old
level and the depression in the in
field filled to track level.
The track itself will be insulated
with redwood bark, imported from
northern woods, declared to greatly
surpass regular wood shavings usu
-1 ally used for the purpose. Cinders
have been obtained from Salt Lake
City, nearest place to the West Coast
where the coal remnants can be se
cured.
Jump Pits in Center
I High jump and broad jump pits
are being built near the center of
I the field with the pole vault unit
situated near the track on the
bleacher side.
The turfed javelin takeoff will be
located in almost the same spot it
occupied in old Angell Field days,
and moved a few feet from time to
I time to prevent wearing down the
j turf in any one place.
As yet the discus location has not
been decided. Coaches and specta
| tors would like to see it placed with
in the confines of the track but lack
1 of space makes this impossible.
McDonnell Supervises
Stanford's superintendent of build
ings and grounds, Sam McDonnell,
i has been superintending the general
; construction of the new unit with
Professor Charles Moser of the Civil
Engineering Department handling
the surveying.
Student labor has been utilized
wherever possible. Frankie Alustiza
and Brower Dellinger did most of
the surveying; a number of other
Stanfordites held down general la
bor costs.
