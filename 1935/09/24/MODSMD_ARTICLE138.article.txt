# Baseball Hopes Will Depend On Green Hurlers
## Pitching Staff, Outfield Hit By 1935 Graduation 
### 
Hopes of the 1936 Cardinal varsity
baseball squad will depend on the
effectiveness of incoming pitchers to
replace Fred Heringer and Stan An
derson, first-string twirlers last
spring.
Coach Harry Wolter will depend
entirely on young hurlers â€” about
whom he knows little or nothing.
One or two are expected to come up
from the freshmen, and junior col
lege transfers may supply additions.
Spike Furman and Dick Hamilton
are the best bets from the frosh of
1935.
Hamilton Leads Team
Besides Heringer and Anderson,
the Cards lost Gordy Mallatratt,
first baseman, and Ted Leidig, cen
ter fielder of the 1935 squad. Cap
tain Bones Hamilton heads the list
of lettermen and varsity members
returning for another year or two of
activity on the diamond.
Ock Morgan and Mike Ferro will
be back to help out with the catch
ing, and Johnny Campbell, A1 Sem
melroth, and Carl Eitner are hold
overs from last year's varsity pitch
ing staff.
Infield Fairly Intact
Ed Clark, Frank Tremaine, Archie
Zamloch, and Howell Turner will
return for another year of infielding.
They are all lettermen, and will sat
isfactorily cover every position ex
cept first base, where Mallatratt held
a monopoly last season.
Al Brent is the only returning
regular for the outfield.
From San Mateo Jaysee comes
Hegarty, all-conference catcher. He
was one of the leading sluggers of
the San Mateo nine. Modesto Junior
College sends over Ray Weierhau
ser, third baseman and pitcher, and
Menlo's contribution is Farrell, ace
short stop.
