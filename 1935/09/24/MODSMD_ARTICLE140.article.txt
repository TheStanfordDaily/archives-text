Cards—Best in West—
On Spot This Year
Stanford is on the spot!
Sports headlines scream — "In- i
dians Rated Best in West"—"Watch
Stanford This year"—
Twelve of fourteen coaches of
leading western schools vote Stan
ford to win the conference in a
United Press poll.
Every Indian opponent is ready
to sacrifice everything for a win J
over the Cards.
Yes, the Injun is on the spot, all
right.
But Tiny and his gang are getting [
ready to meet all demands and from 1
the way things are shaping up after !
their first week of practice "every- ,
thing is going to be all right," to use
Tiny's own words.
Lack of Reserves I
May Cause Trouble
There are a few points that might !
j cause trouble, though. First of all,
! the lack of reserve strength looms {
| as a fairly dangerous obstacle. The j
1 California game last year taught us
what happens when a team goes on j
| the field only one deep. Some of
i those first stringers came out pretty
| well banged up and the reserves
1 found tough going to hold down
their jobs.
And it appears that the same
trouble might be experienced
again this season. Tiny is paying
a lot of attention to his second
1 and third strings just for that rea
son.
Then there's the pass defiense. A
lot is being said about Stanford's
pass offense, that she's taking to the
air this year, that she's going to use
: frequent laterals. That's all being
| taken care of, and everything seems
! rosy as far as pass catching and
I throwing are concerned.
A Good Pass Defense
Will Be Necessary
But what about the defense? Ala
' bama—hate to mention them—grou
bama — hate to mention them —
ground Stanford to bits with passes.
The Cards just couldn't stop them.
Chances are few that another gang
of passing- demons will meet Stan
ford this year, at least not one like
; they met in the Rose Bowl last New
Year's. But there will be a lot of
passing going on and a good de-
I fense will be essential.
However, much time remains to
; go into the strong and weak points
of Stanford's 1935 varsity, and a
great deal, probably too much, will
be said before the sun sets on the
current season.
A glimpse of the lighter side of
I this Indian machine might be in
order. Tiny's gang covered a lot of
territory during the summer months
at every occupation from working
as a Hollywood extra to digging
| ditches.
Football Players
Had Varied Summers
Most of the fellows got work in
the oil fields or pumping gas. But
a lot of them covered more unusual
I fields.
Alf Brandin did private tutor
ing in Pennsylvania, Grant Stone
and Cy Oberg pulled jinrickshas
at the San Diego Expo, Frankie
Alustiza surveyed the new Angell
Field, Fred Williams drove a
steam shovel on a Colorado proj

ect, and Keith Topping went
movie star in Hollywood.
Bobby Grayson went to sumiiK-r
school at University of Hawaii, A1
Trompas lugged ice cream in San
Diego, Jack Clarke handled a weld
ing torch on piers at Santa Barbara
and Ventura. Then there are gold
miners Pop Grant, Jimmy Cofiis,
and Bob Dakin.
Bob Black did a little lumbering
in the northern country and Bill
Paulman, Woody Adams, Joe
Vigna, Leo Madlem, Johnny Reis
ner, Tom Collins. Bob Manpan,
and YVes Muller helped various
oil companies carry on.
Then there were others who col
lected sunshine at Carmel, held
down clerking jobs, and went to
summer school.
But now the whole gang is back
on the Farm to take part in a busi
ness more important to most of them
than the summer work.
Their new job is going to be a
tough one and the pay won't amount
to anything in actual dollars and
cents, but if they're successful a
lot of people will want to thank
them and will be mighty glad to yell
away their voices doing it.
