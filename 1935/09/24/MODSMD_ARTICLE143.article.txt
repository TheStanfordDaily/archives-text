# San Jose Game Set Despite 'Proselyting'
## Indians To Meet Spartans Though Other Squads Cancel Tilts 
### 
Though three colleges have can
celled their games with San Jose
State because of alleged "proselyt
ing" of football men, Stanford will
play the Spartans Saturday as sched
uled. •
This declaration came today from
Dud De Groot, San Jose coach, and
with the approval of Tiny Thornhill,
separates the black cats and the
white in the hissing and scratching
confusion over the Teachers' football
ethics.
It also clears Stanford of any con
nection as hand-maiden to the black
art of team-priming. For under Pa
cific Coast Conference rules, one
free meal per day to football men is
allowed. Which, in De Groot's opin
ion, doesn't make the three meals
per day served at San Jose State
and free beds at the campus Y.M.
C.A. illegal in actuality, but illegal
only in degree. And a justified il
legality, as he explained.
Explains Action
Meanwhile, De Groot revealed
how and why the California Agri
cultural College, Fresno State, and
Chico State had cancelled games
with San Jose.
"Their cancellations were all made
following a conference meeting in
December when the games were
scheduled," De Groot said. "At the
meeting, representatives of these
schools gained full knowledge of
our plan for housing and feeding
football men, and agreed to play us
knowing conditions."
"They are technically breaking
contract, and leaving us virtually
without a planned season," he said.
San Jose State is in no sense of
the word proselyting, De Groot re
vealed. Only football men who can
prove their need are given three
free meals per day in the school
cafeteria and sleeping quarters —
concessions which have full ap

Men Need Help
' We are absolutely not offering
these advantages to possible athletic
entrants," the San Jose mentor de
clared. We merely believe it to be
unfair to xpect men to play football,
carry an academic program, and then
work sometimes until midnight and
after to be financially able to con
tinue their education. The offer of
help is good only during fall quar
ter, and is automatically withdrawn
in the spring," he said.
"We feel the aid is entirely justi
fied under conditions prevailing at
the school. If it is a violation of Far
Western Conference rules, even if
football itself has to go by the boards,
we will hold to our conviction that
we know our school best, and know
best what to do for it."
