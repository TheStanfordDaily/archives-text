# Cards Beaten By Pittsburgh In 12-0 Tussle
## Defeat Leaves St. Louis In Wake of Cubs, Who 'Lead 3 1/2 Games 
### 
ST. LOUIS, Sept. 23 VP).— The
Pittsburgh Pirates, buccaneers in
more than name today, forced the
St. Louis Cardinals to walk the plank
to the tune of 12 to 0 and left the
1934 world champions with little
more than hope they can pass the
league-leading Chicago Cubs and
win -another pennant.
Chief Buccaneers were Big Jim
Weaver, hurler, who limited the
Cards to four hits, two of these in
the ninth, and Floyd Young, second
sacker, who drove in seven runs.
Cubs Resting
The defeat shoved the second
place Cardinals three and a half
games behind the Cubs, who come
here Wednesday for a five-game
series to end the season. Chicago is
idle today and tomorrow. St. Louis
could lose tomorrow and take the
pennant by sweeping the Cub series.
Three runs were scored by the
Pirates in the first inning, almost
before the crowd of 7,500, small con
sidering that the American Legion
national convention is in session
here, had settled down for the
game. Young's double, one of two
he collected among his three hits,
scored Woody Jensen, Lloyd Waner,
and Arky Vaughan, but Young was
out at third trying to stretch the
blow into a triple.
Jensen had opened with a double
and was safe at third when Duro
cher struck him with the ball as he
tried to nab the Pirate after fielding
Lloyd Waner's blow. Waner went to
second. Vaughan was walked. Then
came Young's timely double.
Third Inning Rout
In the third came the slaughter
and the retirement of Ed Heusser,
first of five pitchers Frankie Frisch
called to the mound in a futile ef
fort to halt the Pirate crew. Four
straight hits, the last by Young
scoring two runs, finished Heusser.
Tony Kaufmann was touched for
three more runs after the inning
closed.
Frisch's hit in the fourth was the
first safety off Weaver, who yielded
another to Pinch Hitter Sam Nar
row in the sixth and two in the
ninth — Davis and Gelbert. The
Cards' only serious threat was in the
final inning.
Hits Spread Evenly
Medwick, clean-up batter, popped
to Young. Davie, who was sent to
first base for Jim Collins in the ninth,
singled to center. DeLancey was
safe when Young fumbled the ball
and Davis reached second. Lyle
Judy, base stealing sensation of the
western association this year, flied
out to Lloyd Waner. Gelbert singled
to left and the bases were crammed
as Dizzy Dean, ace pitcher, came to
bat for Phil Collins. Dizzy grounded
out to Young.
Pittsburgh's 16 hits were distrib
uted about equally between four
players—Jensen 4, and Young Lloyd
Waner and Vaughan each three.
Weaver's record was marred some
what by seven bases on balls but
they did not prove disastrous.

out to Lloyd Waner. Gelbert singled
to left and the bases were crammed
as Dizzy Dean, ace pitcher, came to
bat for Phil Collins. Dizzy grounded
out to Young.
Pittsburgh's 16 hits were distrib
uted about equally between four
players—Jensen 4, and Young Lloyd
Waner and Vaughan each three.
Weaver's record was marred some
what by seven bases on balls but
they did not prove disastrous.
ST. LOUIS, Sept. 23 VP).— The
Pittsburgh Pirates, buccaneers in
more than name today, forced the
St. Louis Cardinals to walk the plank
to the tune of 12 to 0 and left the
1934 world champions with little
more than hope they can pass the
league-leading Chicago Cubs and
win -another pennant.
Chief Buccaneers were Big Jim
Weaver, hurler, who limited the
Cards to four hits, two of these in
the ninth, and Floyd Young, second
sacker, who drove in seven runs.
Cubs Resting
The defeat shoved the second
place Cardinals three and a half
games behind the Cubs, who come
here Wednesday for a five-game
series to end the season. Chicago is
idle today and tomorrow. St. Louis
could lose tomorrow and take the
pennant by sweeping the Cub series.
Three runs were scored by the
Pirates in the first inning, almost
before the crowd of 7,500, small con
sidering that the American Legion
national convention is in session
here, had settled down for the
game. Young's double, one of two
he collected among his three hits,
scored Woody Jensen, Lloyd Waner,
and Arky Vaughan, but Young was
out at third trying to stretch the
blow into a triple.
Jensen had opened with a double
and was safe at third when Duro
cher struck him with the ball as he
tried to nab the Pirate after fielding
Lloyd Waner's blow. Waner went to
second. Vaughan was walked. Then
came Young's timely double.
Third Inning Rout
In the third came the slaughter
and the retirement of Ed Heusser,
first of five pitchers Frankie Frisch
called to the mound in a futile ef
fort to halt the Pirate crew. Four
straight hits, the last by Young
scoring two runs, finished Heusser.
Tony Kaufmann was touched for
three more runs after the inning
closed.
Frisch's hit in the fourth was the
first safety off Weaver, who yielded
another to Pinch Hitter Sam Nar
row in the sixth and two in the
ninth — Davis and Gelbert. The
Cards' only serious threat was in the
final inning.
Hits Spread Evenly
Medwick, clean-up batter, popped
to Young. Davie, who was sent to
first base for Jim Collins in the ninth,
singled to center. DeLancey was
safe when Young fumbled the ball
and Davis reached second. Lyle
Judy, base stealing sensation of the
western association this year, flied
out to Lloyd Waner. Gelbert singled
to left and the bases were crammed
as Dizzy Dean, ace pitcher, came to
bat for Phil Collins. Dizzy grounded
out to Young.
Pittsburgh's 16 hits were distrib
uted about equally between four
players—Jensen 4, and Young Lloyd
