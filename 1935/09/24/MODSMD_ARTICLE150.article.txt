# '34-'35 Sport Year Reviewed

### 
Judging the 1934 Stanford sports
season as a whole, the decision isâ€”
not too good and not too bad.
Football started the year off to a
flying start. Victories over the
coast's leading teams set Stanford
high, but then came the Rose Bowl
game. Of course that set things
back a bit.
Basketball, with a fairly strong
early season appearance, elevated
the Indian for a time until Califor
nia stopped the victories in that
field.
Then came track and with a weak
team all season Stanford piled up
one defeat after another. But the
tennis team was sweeping every
thing in sight about that time, so
that bettered the situation.
Baseball, like track, was hard up
for victories. But to offset that
downslip, Lawson Little, Jr., was
winning the British Amateur Goif
Championship, and carrying the
name of Stanford around the world.
In the minor shorts, water polo,
swimming, soccer, fencing, and box
ing Card athletes had mediocre sea
sons.
Freshman athletics enjoyed about
the same success as did varsity
sports. Football went undefeated
until California dealt the death blow,
basketball met with a similar fate at
the hands of Bear Cubs.
Frosh trackmen started the season
well, gathered headway until the
Little Big Meet when the loss of the
relay was the loss of the meet.
Freshman tennis men stood high
when the season closed.
