# Million Dollar Gate To Gather for Fight
## Max Baer-joe Louis Battle in Yankee Stadium Predicted Sell-out; Scalpers Will Reap Up to $200 Profit on Tickets 
### 
NEW YORK, Sept. 23 (/P). â€”A re
morseless Negro with a punch; a ,
giant, reckless white man, half kill
er, half clown, rolled back the years
of the fight game tonight to the day
when Tex Rickard and hysteria were
i twin kings, and money was like
sand.
Joe Louis, the chocolate soldier
! from Detroit, and Max Baer, the
I curly haired Californian, meet in the |
ring at the Yankee Stadium for 15
rounds tomorrow night and, for the
! tight faithful, starved for years for
] a natural such as this, it was as
! though Lindbergh were flying the
Atlantic again, or the battle of the
| Maine itself were being pitched into
the huge ball park.
Records Threatened
So great was the rush for tickets
that there was no question gross
gate receipts would exceed $1,000,000
j and in doing so pei'haps break box
! ing records New York never thought
; would be challenged again.
Mike Jacobs, down to the bot
tom of the ticket barrel, predicted
i every one of the 94,569 paste
boards printed for the duel would
bo sold by 7 p.m. tomorrow, an
hour after standing room
tickets go on sale down town.
| If that happens, the crowd at the
. Yankee Stadium will represent the
| greatest ever to gather for an ath-
J letic event in New York, surpassing
| (he 85,262 who saw a baseball
double header between the Yanks
i and Athletics in the stadium Sep-
I tember 9, 1928; pay total receipts of
I $1,184,830.10, exceeding the past rec-
I old of $1,083,530 for a non-title
heavyweight match of Jack Derpp
sey and Jack Sharkey in the Pqlo
Grounds in 1927.
Ring Scats, $150-$2OO
Ticket speculators, holding choice
ringside seats, were calmly asking
$150 to $200 apiece for them as spe
cial trains from as far away as San
Francisco poured tens of thousands
into the city to jam every hotel.
Some of the larger hostelries plan
ned to bed down many of the fight
fanatics in their public, rooms to
night. It was estimated that $10,-
000,000 in extra revenue was flowing
into the city.
Everywhere groups were arguing,
and all the big commissioners agreed
that more money was being wager
ed than on any fight since Dempsey
and Tunney fought the second time

in Chicago in 1927. Odds favoring
Louis at 5 to 8 yesterday length
ened to 5 to 9 today as the Bear
money, in the hands of many wise
operators, waited for the best pos
sible price. The race track contin
gent, headed by Tim Mara, one of
the major bookmakers, held favorite.
