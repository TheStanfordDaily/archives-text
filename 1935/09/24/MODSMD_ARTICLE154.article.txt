# New Offensive Play Designed For Flashy Card Water Poloists
## Veteran Swimmers Return To Bolster Chances For Championship 
### 
Preparing for what promises to be
one of Stanford's most active sea
sons of water polo and swimming,
Coach Norf Thornton assembled his
squad of 21 poloists last week for
six days of early practice to work
on his new offensive system. Coach
Thornton has designed his new plays
in conformation with the Hungarian
style of play.
The new system allows an or
ganized play from every free
throw and places the forwards in
better scoring positions. Accord
ing to the coach, the squad is in
line shape and the first team will
probably he composed of many of
last year's regulars.
Bill Clemo, Bob Hoover, Charles
Giifon, Bill Woodard, Wally Wiget,
Suds Sutherland, and Bob Haslacher
compose the first team which was
being used in first week's practice.
Co-captains Woodard and Wiget,
and Haslacher, goalie, are all-Pacific
Coast players picked from last year's
championship team.
Practice which was held at Menlo
J.C. pool in the mornings and Se
quoia High School in the afternoons
will be resumed today at the En
cina pools. Constant work on the
new system and fundamentals
should round the squad into shape
for their first encounter Septem
ber 30.
They defend their Pacific Coast
Conference championship and the
Northern California League title
against the Athens Club in Oak
land. The Northern California
league will be considered the Pa
cific Coast Association of the
A.A.U., thereby making the win
ners A.A.U. champs.
The only loss the team has suf
fered this season is the temporary
absence of Ben Voss who was play
ing in Giffon's position. A strong
lorce of reserves composed of last
year's frosh and junior varsity men
should keep the first squad on its
guard.
Added to the long list of champs
comes Lomax Turner and Roy
Winkleman, ail-American sprinter
and diver, respectively; Winfield
Nieda, junior national 500-yard
champ; Jack Vibert, So. Cal sprint
champ; and Bob Walker from
Golden Gate J.C., who holds the
world's 440-meter backstroke rec
ord.
Besides these new record holders
and champions Henry Godman is re
turning to Stanford, and Bill Lah
mon, sophomore transfer from last
year, will be eligible. Godman was
picked on the ail-American team
two years ago and Lahmon has
turned in 23.5 for the 50 sprint.

fered this season is the temporary
absence of Ben Voss who was play
ing in Giffon's position. A strong
lorce of reserves composed of last
year's frosh and junior varsity men
should keep the first squad on its
guard.
Added to the long list of champs
comes Lomax Turner and Roy
Winkleman, ail-American sprinter
and diver, respectively; Winfield
Nieda, junior national 500-yard
champ; Jack Vibert, So. Cal sprint
champ; and Bob Walker from
Golden Gate J.C., who holds the
world's 440-meter backstroke rec
ord.
Besides these new record holders
and champions Henry Godman is re
turning to Stanford, and Bill Lah
mon, sophomore transfer from last
year, will be eligible. Godman was
picked on the ail-American team
two years ago and Lahmon has
turned in 23.5 for the 50 sprint.
Preparing for what promises to be
one of Stanford's most active sea
sons of water polo and swimming,
Coach Norf Thornton assembled his
squad of 21 poloists last week for
six days of early practice to work
on his new offensive system. Coach
Thornton has designed his new plays
in conformation with the Hungarian
style of play.
The new system allows an or
ganized play from every free
throw and places the forwards in
better scoring positions. Accord
ing to the coach, the squad is in
line shape and the first team will
probably he composed of many of
last year's regulars.
Bill Clemo, Bob Hoover, Charles
Giifon, Bill Woodard, Wally Wiget,
Suds Sutherland, and Bob Haslacher
compose the first team which was
being used in first week's practice.
Co-captains Woodard and Wiget,
and Haslacher, goalie, are all-Pacific
Coast players picked from last year's
championship team.
Practice which was held at Menlo
J.C. pool in the mornings and Se
quoia High School in the afternoons
will be resumed today at the En
cina pools. Constant work on the
new system and fundamentals
should round the squad into shape
for their first encounter Septem
ber 30.
They defend their Pacific Coast
Conference championship and the
Northern California League title
against the Athens Club in Oak
land. The Northern California
league will be considered the Pa
cific Coast Association of the
A.A.U., thereby making the win
ners A.A.U. champs.
