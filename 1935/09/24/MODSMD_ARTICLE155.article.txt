# Golfers Will Open Fall Season Today
## 
### 
Both varsity and freshman golf
ers will tsart their qualifying rounds
for 1935-36 team positions today.
By Wednesday, October 2, two
rounds must be completed and at
that time the top sixteen of each
division will make up the teams.
Only two varsity men, Jack Hoer
ner and Tom. Dwyer, were lost
through graduation this year, but
some doubt remains as to whether
British and American champion
Lawson Little will return for team
play.
A powerful group from last year's
frosh team will bolster the varsity
ranks and to use Coach Twigg's
words "the season holds great po
tentialities."
