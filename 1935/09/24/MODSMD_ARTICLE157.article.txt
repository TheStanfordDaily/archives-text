[ be in charge of this fall event.

Golf Will Prosper
An active year in golf is antici
pated, says Mrs. Brent Potter, in
j structor. Mixed foursomes will be
i held once a month. Women golfers
! may still sign up for classes. Al-
I though advanced golf is almost
! filled, a few vacancies may still re
main until noon today. Elementary
golf classes are still open to both
new and old women.
Orchesis, women's honorary dance
sorority, will announce tryouts for
I membership in the near future. All
; upperclass transfers or graduate
i students who were members of
I other dancing clubs, however, may
; attend meetings of Orchesis without
; the formality of a tryout.
j Changes in the fundamental
wording of rules already in exist
ence and a few minor changes in
others are the only variations no
ticeable in the 1936 football rule
book.
