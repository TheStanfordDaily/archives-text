# Veteran Quint May End Card Losing Streak
## Frosh, Jaysee Hoop Stars' To Supply Wealth Of Varsity Material 
### 
If a wealth of high-class material
built around a nucleus of five re
turning lettermen play to the capa
bilities of which their records indi
cate they are able, Stanford's bas
ketball squad for the season of 1935-
36 should go a long way toward end
ing a "victory famine" which has
been prevalent in the hoop sport on
the Stanford campus during recent
years.
Dinty Moore Returns
Coach John Bunn will rely greatly
upon the ability and experience of
Bryan "Dinty" Moore, last year's
captain and ail-coast guard, and
Howell Turner, who during the pre
vious season played consistently
good ball as a regular forward. The
other returning lettermen, who all
saw considerable action, are Bill
Quade, Ken Nobs, and Kenneth
Ball.
Several other prospects will an
swer Bunn's call for the first prac
tice session, among whom the out
standing are Hank Luisetti, Arthur
Stoefen, Harold Robertson, and Bob
Zonne.
Luisetti, according lo Coach
Bunn, should turn into the best
liaskethall player ever to attend
Stanford. This opinion is shared
by many others who saw the lanky
forward score nearly 350 points
during 17 games as a freshman last
season. Zonne also comes up
from the 1934-35 papoose squad,
and his record was outstanding
until he was forced out because of
an injury during mid-season.
Stoefen, six-foot five-inch center
who was ineligible last year, has an
enviable record, as does Robertson,
a junior college transfer who was
picked unanimously as a member of
the all-J.C. team last year.
Many Lettermen Lost
Loss of nine of the twelve men
who went on the eastern tour at the
beginning of last season is one thing
which will be keenly felt as it leaves
the burden of filling-in with men
who lack experience in collegiate
competition.
Graduated members of last year's
squad include Keith Topping, Rod
Bost, Arne Anderson, Robin Lind
say, Wytze Gorter, and Emit Cowing.
The Indians will have one big ad
vantage which has been noticeably
lacking in Card teams of the last few
years—they will average about six

feet three inches in height. Thii
weakness of short players has been
especially evident against the al
ways lanky Califoi'nia Bears.
Reserves Good
Other men who can be count d
on for excellent reserve material
and possibly for displacing some of
their more outstanding team-mates
are Jack Calderwood, Duane Ed
monds, Pete Allen, all transfers, and
Nellie Heath and Dick Lyons,, both
up from last year's frosh squad.
At the end of spring quarter this
year in practice games the squad
lined up as follows: forwards—Lui
setti and Turner; guards — Moore
and Zonne; center —Stoefen.

their more outstanding team-mates
are Jack Calderwood, Duane Ed
monds, Pete Allen, all transfers, and
Nellie Heath and Dick Lyons,, both
up from last year's frosh squad.
At the end of spring quarter this
year in practice games the squad
lined up as follows: forwards—Lui
setti and Turner; guards — Moore
and Zonne; center —Stoefen.
If a wealth of high-class material
built around a nucleus of five re
turning lettermen play to the capa
bilities of which their records indi
cate they are able, Stanford's bas
ketball squad for the season of 1935-
36 should go a long way toward end
ing a "victory famine" which has
been prevalent in the hoop sport on
the Stanford campus during recent
years.
Dinty Moore Returns
Coach John Bunn will rely greatly
upon the ability and experience of
Bryan "Dinty" Moore, last year's
captain and ail-coast guard, and
Howell Turner, who during the pre
vious season played consistently
good ball as a regular forward. The
other returning lettermen, who all
saw considerable action, are Bill
Quade, Ken Nobs, and Kenneth
Ball.
Several other prospects will an
swer Bunn's call for the first prac
tice session, among whom the out
standing are Hank Luisetti, Arthur
Stoefen, Harold Robertson, and Bob
Zonne.
Luisetti, according lo Coach
Bunn, should turn into the best
liaskethall player ever to attend
Stanford. This opinion is shared
by many others who saw the lanky
forward score nearly 350 points
during 17 games as a freshman last
season. Zonne also comes up
from the 1934-35 papoose squad,
and his record was outstanding
until he was forced out because of
an injury during mid-season.
Stoefen, six-foot five-inch center
who was ineligible last year, has an
enviable record, as does Robertson,
a junior college transfer who was
picked unanimously as a member of
the all-J.C. team last year.
Many Lettermen Lost
Loss of nine of the twelve men
who went on the eastern tour at the
beginning of last season is one thing
which will be keenly felt as it leaves
the burden of filling-in with men
who lack experience in collegiate
competition.
Graduated members of last year's
squad include Keith Topping, Rod
Bost, Arne Anderson, Robin Lind
say, Wytze Gorter, and Emit Cowing.
The Indians will have one big ad
vantage which has been noticeably
lacking in Card teams of the last few
years—they will average about six

feet three inches in height. Thii
weakness of short players has been
especially evident against the al
ways lanky Califoi'nia Bears.
Reserves Good
Other men who can be count d
on for excellent reserve material
and possibly for displacing some of
their more outstanding team-mates
are Jack Calderwood, Duane Ed
monds, Pete Allen, all transfers, and
Nellie Heath and Dick Lyons,, both
up from last year's frosh squad.
