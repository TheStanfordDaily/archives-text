# Wilbur Greets Campusites As Quarter Opens
## 
### 
For some of us the year begins in
late September and January first is
something of an anti-climax. Our
association with Stanford has lasted
long enough so that the coming of
the new students with the fall quar
ter is the predominant "beginning"
of the year.
Our life here suddenly jumps
from the quiet of our only vacation
month into full life at the Univer
sity. Hundreds of new faces appear
in the quadrangle, in the classrooms,
and in every part of the institution.
In them we try to see the future of
the Stanford we love.
We want them to feel as we do in
the sense of possession of this great
educational institution and in that
of responsibility to carry it forward
and turn it over improved and more
effective to our successors.
To each new student must come
a new feeling of freedom, personal
accountability for his own actions,
and a glow of pride in becoming a
part of the ever widening Stanford
family. To each returning student
there comes anew the comradeship
of the campus, the stimulation of the
classroom, library, and laboratory,
and the sense of progress along a
well-chosen path.
It is good to be back or to come
for the first time to the Stanford
campus; and as President I welcome
each and all of you.
