# Saint Mary's Meets Nevada in First Tilt
## 
### 
MORAGA. Sept. 23.â€”Coach Ed
ward "Slip" Madigan watched his
Galloping Gaels run through a
promising freshman squad in a prac
tice game Saturday, and then pro
ceeded to scold his charges thor
oughly for numerous missed blocks,
tackles, and other routine tasks.
Evidently the potentially unbeat
able team from Moraga is taking
Nevada seriously in the opening
game to be played next Saturday,
and strenuous workouts are the or
der of the day so that last year's
defeat will not be repeated.
