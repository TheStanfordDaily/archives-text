will return to school this year, ac
cording to his mother, Mrs. W. Law
son Little Sr. The American and
British amateur champ is now in

to whether Little will play on the
Stanford team this year or whether
he will take a rest from the game.

if he decides to play will be seeded
in the No. 1 position on the team,
according to Coach Eddie Twiggs.
Rated Greatest Amateur
The record which Little has set
during the past summer has estab
lished him, in the opinion of many
critics, as the greatest amateur in
the history of the game.
In the first event in which he
played this summer, the Master's at
Atlanta, Little finished sixth in a
field ol America's finest pros, and
was the top amateur.
What happened at the British
amateur in Scotland is a matter of
record. Although the margin in his
final match was not so great as that
of his victory in 1934, he won the
event without close competition.
Is National Champion
Upon his return to this country
he entered the United States Ama
teur. After a close first match, Little
methodically made his way to the
finals where he met Walter Emery,
University of Oklahoma star. Em
ery managed to hold Little in check
and finish the first 18 holes of the
36-hole match even. In the after
noon x'ound Little built up an early
lead which Emery all but obliterated
by sub par golf, but Little bested
him with birdies and a concluding
eagle to win the match, 4-2, for his
thirty-first consecutive victory in
national amateur golf.
