# Moore Will Be Soccer Mentor
## 
### 
For the first time in over a score
of years Harry Maloney will not he
at the helm of Stanford's soccer
team.
The Irish-brogued director of mi
nor sports is traveling far afield on
his year's sabbatical leave and has
left the responsibility of directing
the '35 team in the hands of John
Moore, frosh coach for iwo years and
an all-conference Card player two
years ago.
Moore is no stranger to the re
turning players. Many learned their
soccer from him on the '37 frosh
team. And he has been Maloney's
right-hand man as long as any of
this year's team has been in Stan
ford uniform. "I have no qualms
about leaving things in Johnny's
hands," Maloney told the team be
fore he left last spring.
Practice This Week
New head-coach Moore will call
the first practice late this week—
probably on Thursday or Friday.
Uniforms will be issued, and next
week daily workouts will be held in
preparation for the opening of the
conference season early in October.
The '34 soccer team was green.
The '35 squad will be practically the
same team but with a year's expe
rience. Moore will be able to skip
I lie grind of breaking in new play
ers and concentrate on a try for a
conference win.

Pete Peck, Rudy Gonzales, Waddy
White, A1 Navarro, and Mike Gomez

the positions vacated by the seniors.

The schedule for this year in
cludes Iwo games each with San
Jose, California, San Mateo, and
University of San Francisco, The
squad may make a trip to Los An
