# Student Government Keynote, Says Brooke
## 
### 
To all new men and women the
A.S.S.U. issues its especial welcome,
and its hope that you w'll soon
learn to know and like our customs
and our campus.
The "Farm's" student self-gov
ernment is the keynote responsible
for its sustained school spirit. The
year 1935-36 should bring an even
greater campus consciousness with
its attendant larger enrollment.
You incoming students come to a
new home, new ideas, new oppor
tunities, and new responsibilities.
It is our hope that your help and
interest will make a big year easy
to attain.
Welcome to the "Farm."
