# Coast Gridmen Ready To Begin '35 Campaigns
## Most of Pacific Elevens Will Open Schedules This Week-End 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 23.—
Speed and trickery is being stressed
in the University of San Francisco
stronghold during practice this week
as Coach Spud Lewis prepares his
Dons for a combat with Santa Clara
in an opener next Saturday. Lewis
will emphasize the "fancy" in an en
deavor to cope with Santa Clara
and Stanford manpower on succeed
ing Saturdays.
His team has shown adeptness at
executing multiple laterals beyond
the line of scrimmage on either run
ning or passing plays. Many of his
first stringers have gained smooth
ness along this line by a season of
rugby experience.
U.C.L.A. Squad
Stresses Laterals
LOS ANGELES, Sept. 23.—
Launching their eleventh season un
der Coach Bill Spalding with prac
tice last week, the U.C.L.A. football
squad, numbering only 35, was the
smallest among Coast Conference
colleges.
The backfield looms as a well
balanced unit, but the line lacks
reinforcements. Judging from the
smooth execution in practice, lateral
pass plays will be among the chief
Bruin offensive weapons in the com
ing campaign which opens Friday
night with Utah Agricultural Col
lege.
Huskies Have Good
Backs, Green Line
SEATTLE, Sept. 23.—Coach Jim
my Phelan, with a versatile band of
Husky backs, is losing most of his
sleep lately in dreams of a line. The
small opening practice turnout of 50
includes numerous big but inexpe
rienced forward wall potentialities,
but he has a long ways to go in re
placing the long list of linemen lost
by graduation.
The Huskies, always slow start
ers, fear trouble from the Idaho
Vandals Saturday when the two
open here.
Broncos Scrimmage
Behind Locked Gates
SANTA CLARA, Sept. 23.—1n a
strenuous practice session Saturday
the Bronco varsity under the direc
tion of Coach Maurice "Clipper"
Smith engaged a powerful freshman
squad in a scrimmage behind locked
gates.
Clipper had the boys "shoot the
works," which included flashy spin
ners, laterals and passes from all the
backs and powerful line smashing
from 235-pound fullback Jack So
brero, and the outcome of it all was
a 39 to 6 victory for the varsity.
All the preparation is for the
U.S.F. Dons in the season's opener
next Saturday.

BERKELEY, Sept. 23.—California
