(Editor's Note: Many athletes in
Coast Conference schools from
time to time have been declared
ineligible oil a technicality. The
following article is designed to ex
plain to campus athletes in gen
eral, and more particularly to
newcomers, some of the intricacies
of the conference eligibility regu
lations.)
Stanford's football team, it appears
from early season press releases, will
be one-deep ;it, fullback. This is
largely because Stan Anderson, ex
pected to return for his last year of
football, was declared ineligible on
a technicality.
The Pacific Coast Intercollegiate
Athletic Conference has included in
its 48-page pamphlet governing the
conduct of athletics within its jur
isdiction, the following paragraph:
No student shall represent his
institution in varsity competition
in any one sport in more than
three separate seasons and shall
not compete in varsity competition
in more than four separate aca
demic years.
Anderson had played only two
years of football, but he had com
peted in baseball and football to
gether during four separate seasons
—which lets him out of any further
varsity competition of any sort at
Stanford.
There are many such technicali
ties, and athletes often cannot un
derstand why they have been de
clared ineligible. Among the more
important are:
Tcehnalitics Explained
1. The always controversial rules
pertaining to the granting of scholar
ships. There are three restrictions
to these gifts and loans—they must
be based or. need, the receiver must
maintain a C average, and "scholar
ships, except those awarded on the
basis of superior scholarship attain
ment, shall not be awarded to ath
letes in greater number than to
non-athletes."
2. Every athlete must pass in at
least ten hours of work in the last
quarter of residence at a Confer
ence school previous to participa
tion. The total bawl-out rating is
not taken into consideration in this
case.
Frosh Athletes Hit
3. An athlete is ineligible if he
has total failures on his previous
record exceeding one-fifth of the
total hours passed by him. This rule
frequently hits second quarter fresh
men. For example, if a freshman in
his first quarter fails in three units
and makes a straight A in 12, he is
ineligible during his second quarter.
4. A senior who has completed
requirements for graduation, wheth
er the degree has been voted or not,
is automatically ineligible.
5. A student registering later than
three weeks after the first day of
classes will be ineligible for the re
mainder of that quarter.

6. Except in the case of junior
j college transfers, it requires a full
academic year (autumn, winter, and
spring quarters) for a student to es
tablish residence at an institution. If
he should transfer to another school,
his residence will be lost. A special
concession has been made transfers
from junior colleges immediately
eligible.
7. Eligibility from one quarter
holds until the first day of classes
of the following quarter. That is,
anyone eligible during football
season is still eligible for the Rose
Bowl on January 1, hut anyone
ineligible winter quarter cannot
join the track team for a trip dur
ing spring vacation.
Professor Joseph C. Hinsey, Stan
ford representative on conference
scholarship matters, has urged that
any potential athlete who is at all
doubtful of his case, report to his
! office before the conference axe has
| a chance to fall.

Anderson had played only two
years of football, but he had com

varsity competition of any sort at
Stanford.
There are many such technicali
ties, and athletes often cannot un
derstand why they have been de
clared ineligible. Among the more
important are:
Tcehnalitics Explained
1. The always controversial rules
pertaining to the granting of scholar
ships. There are three restrictions
to these gifts and loans—they must
be based or. need, the receiver must
maintain a C average, and "scholar
ships, except those awarded on the
basis of superior scholarship attain
ment, shall not be awarded to ath
letes in greater number than to
non-athletes."
2. Every athlete must pass in at
least ten hours of work in the last
quarter of residence at a Confer
ence school previous to participa
tion. The total bawl-out rating is
not taken into consideration in this
case.

3. An athlete is ineligible if he
has total failures on his previous
record exceeding one-fifth of the
total hours passed by him. This rule
frequently hits second quarter fresh
men. For example, if a freshman in
his first quarter fails in three units
and makes a straight A in 12, he is
ineligible during his second quarter.
4. A senior who has completed
requirements for graduation, wheth
er the degree has been voted or not,
is automatically ineligible.
5. A student registering later than
three weeks after the first day of
classes will be ineligible for the re
mainder of that quarter.

6. Except in the case of junior
j college transfers, it requires a full
academic year (autumn, winter, and
spring quarters) for a student to es
tablish residence at an institution. If
he should transfer to another school,
his residence will be lost. A special
concession has been made transfers
from junior colleges immediately
eligible.
7. Eligibility from one quarter
holds until the first day of classes
of the following quarter. That is,
anyone eligible during football
season is still eligible for the Rose
Bowl on January 1, hut anyone
ineligible winter quarter cannot
join the track team for a trip dur
ing spring vacation.
Professor Joseph C. Hinsey, Stan
ford representative on conference
scholarship matters, has urged that
any potential athlete who is at all
doubtful of his case, report to his

Stanford's football team, it appears
