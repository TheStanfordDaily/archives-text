# Greeks View Altered Row As 7 Rebuild
## Delta Gamma, Kappa Sig, Theta Chi, Delta Chi, Have New Houses 
### 
In June the Row was Domestic-
Victorian. Today it's International
Ancient, stylistically representing at
least three nations â€” Normandy,
England, and Holland.
Which is just one way of saying
that the Greeks spent over $150,000
this summer improving their chap
ter houses. .
The white colonnades and gin
gerbread friezes that constituted
grandpa's idea of a snazzy house
are gone, and the Row becomes
simple, restrained, and in keeping
with the natural beauty of shrub
and tree.
Heading the list for individual ex
pense is Theta Chi, members of
which are reported to be spending
more than $25,000 in remodeling and
enlarging their house. It will be
Mediterranean in style when work
men finish in November.
Add Seven Rooms
The campus pride is the new
Kappa Sigma house, one of the two
reconstruction jobs completed to
date. Members of the local chapter
voted an Early Georgian type and
added seven new rooms and new
furnishings at a toval cost of $23,500.
Seven new yellow-tiled showers
and five additional rooms with a
brand new plan mark the com
pletely rebuilt Delta Gamma
house. New servants' quarters, an
additional sleeping porch, and a
sun porch were also added, bring
ing the total cost of the new house
to $18,000.
With workmen still busy, the
Delta Chi's were planning early oc
cupation of their remodeled home.
The style is French Norman. Ten
additional rooms have been added,
in complete rebuilding, bringing the
investment to $20,000. Charles K.
Sumner of Palo Alto is the archi
tect.
New Wing Added
The Pi Beta Phi house has been
rebuilt as an English manor. Total
! cost of a new wing with 10 rooms
is estimated at $20,000 Meanwhile,
Gamma Phi Beta has added addi
tional living quarters for $10,000.
Just to show them that the hearts
of their employers are more than
large, fifty janitors employed on
the campus will soon move into
their new quartet a one-story,
red-tile-roofed structure opposite
i the B. A. C. on Galvez Street.
1 They will wreck their old shack
j piece by piece, and soon be fully
at home in the new $20,000 building.
Two new women's dorms have
been added to the number already
i occupied. One is the former Har
ker's School at Melville and Har
ker Streets, Palo Alto, where 50
; women will sleep, eat, play tennis
| on three private courts, and swim in
their own tank. Miss Madge Burt
