# Farm Traditions Aid Yearling's Conduct
## 
### 
Traditions arc a vital part of col
lege life, making for genuine school
spirit and a feeling of good fellow
ship among the students. For the
benefit of the bewildered freshmen,
bombarded on all sides by advice as
to what is and what is not done at
Stanford, there follows here a sum
mary of some of the taboos and
customs that have grown up on the
Farm in the past forty years.
First, of course, comes the Hon
or Code, a tradition which is far
reaching in its clTerts and valu
able to all concorned with it. It
is important that incoming stu
dents realize the full import of
this system and understand that
it applies not only to scholastic
work hut to every aspect of their
college life.
The custom of saying "Hello"
when meeting other Stanford stu
dents on tTifc Quad, whether one
knows them or not, is a tradition
which adds greatly to the friendly
spirit of the University. The formal
"attitude found at some institutions
is completely lacking at Stanford,
and a feeling of comradcry and fel
lowship is part of the atmosphere of
the Fnnn.

Another tradition of long standing
is that there shall be no smoking
on the Quad. A request of Mrs.
Stanford, this custom is observed
both in the class rooms and under
the archcs.
Stanford women and freshmen
do not use the Law Steps. These
are diagonally opposite the library
and arc marked by a metal plate
at their foot. Only upperclassmen
wear cords. High school and jun
ior college insignia arc not worn
by University students.
It is customary for Stanforditcs
fortunate enough to have automo
biles to give rides to students wait
ing for the bus, especially those
standing opposite the English corner
or at the railroad station in Palo
Alto.
A spirit of good sportsmanship is
expected of Stanford men and wom
en, and in accordance with this no
"booing" is permitted at athletic
contests or similar events.
Following all football games,
whether Stanford wins or loses, it
is the tradition for the rooting sec
tion to stand and sing the Hymn.
Hats arc removed during the song.
