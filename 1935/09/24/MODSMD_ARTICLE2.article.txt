### 
William Murray Timmons has
been appointed as head of the dra
matic department, according to
word received yesterday. Timmons
was acting head last year in the ab
sence of Harold Helvenston, away
on sabbatical leave.
Last year was Timmons' first at
Stanford. He directed several shows,
including the Gaieties, Follies
Bourgeois, "One Sunday After
noon," and "Yellow Jack."
Helvenston has requested further
leave to fill a position with the Walt
Disney studios. He will not return
to teach this year. Helvenston had
headed the department for the past
several years, and under his regime
had appeared such hits as "Distant
Drums," "Three Cornered Moon,"
and "Arms and the Man."
