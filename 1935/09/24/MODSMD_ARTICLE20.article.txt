# Daily Chooses Unusual Type In Volume 88
## 
### 
Today's initial issue of Volume 88
of the Stanford Daily displays a new
type that has been chosen by the
present editorial board to replace
the much-worn type used in sev
eral previous volumes.
The new type, known as Stymie,
was chosen after several conferences
with typographical experts. This
type is often used for advertising
purposes, but the Daily is probably
the only newspaper in the United
States that uses this style through
out all its pages.
Coupled with the new change in
type is the moving of the editorial
page from the second to the back
page. Also the Daily will display a
new "flag" across the top of the
front page and a new sports page
heading.
