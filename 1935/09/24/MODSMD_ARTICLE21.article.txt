# Strike Holds Up Coal Production
## Bituminous Fields of Over 26 States Involved 
### 
WASHINGTON, Sept. 23 (/P). -
The paralyzing touch of a soft coal
strike was felt tonight in the bitumi
nous fields of 26 states as union
spokesmen and operators struggled
wearily and without immediate suc
cess for a solution.
A battle over wages was the dead
locking issue. Hours of negotiating,
however, narrowed the difference
between the two sides to IV2 cents a
ton on the proposed contract pay for
miners on the amount of coal they
dig and load.
The strike, claimed by the United
Mine Workers to affect 400,000, took
effect automatically last midnight
when the Appalachian wage con
tract—extended five times—expired.
Both sides were reported to be in
an unyielding mood when they met
at 2 p.m., but Edward F. McGrady,
Assistant Secretary of Labor, said
he thought there were "good pros
pects for a settlement."'
McGrady called upon members of
the full Appalachian joint wage
conference to remain in Washing
ton while their negotiating commit
tee of nine miners and nine produc
ers conferred.
"Stand by all day and all night if
necessary so that this unfortunate
situation can be cleaned up," he
urged.
Philip Murray, vice-president of
the United Mine Workers' Union,
said a survey showed that "a few"
Illinois mines employing progres
sive mine workers of America and
"a few" Kentucky mines not under
union contract were all operated
today.
