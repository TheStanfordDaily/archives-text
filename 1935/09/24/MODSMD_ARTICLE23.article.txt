# Stanford Awaits San Jose As '35 Grid Year Opens
## Odds Favor Stanford as Gridders Prepare To Open Season with '34 Team Nearly Intact; First Game Is Saturday 
### GORDY FROST 
Last year Stanford had its "Passless Wonders."
The year before they were called the "Sophomore Sensations."
But what they'll nickname this Stanford varsity of 1935 is going to
be a question. One thing, it will have to be a mighty potent term to
match a mighty potent team.
For this year Stanford starts at the top. Nine returning veterans,
with two years of championship ball behind them. Two newcomers,

'each a top-notcher in his field, will
! go to make up the big red machine
j that receives almost unanimous
j choice for coast honors this year as
I it prepares for its opening game Sat
urday with San Jose State.
Eyes on Cards
Throughout the nation Stanford
has been ballyhooed as the one to
j watch this year. And rightly, too,
lor the dope is definitely pointing
that way.
Yes, with a backfield studed with
an ail-American Bobby Grayson, a
| Bones Hamilton, a Frankie Alustiza,
j and the recently added Bill Paul
: man, a regular four-ring circus of
passing, running, kicking and block -
| ing demons (they all can do every-
I thing) Stanford can't be called weak.
And with that little line in front
I of them the situation isn't hurt, by
any means. Here we have a pair of
veteran ends, Keith Topping and
Monk Moscrip, who last year were
referred to as the "best on the
I coast." And then there are those
j able guards, Woody Adams and
| Larry Rouble, who've got the brawn
, and a lot of brains (o put it wher»
| it belongs.
Line Is Able
Then there's Wes Muller and Alf
Brandin, who have everything under
| good control at the center of the
! line. At tackle Ail-American Bob
! Reynolds and Dale Beedle are very
[able to take care of most any kind
of customers. Beedle is the only new
man to the line replacing Claude
Calloway, unable to x-eturn to the
Farm this lall because of illness.
v s. il r \-p«>ri«»ncc\ ability, and
spirit will make a winning team, the
dopemen are about right when they
put the Cards on top.
There are troubles, however. Ask
Tiny Thomhill v/hat his greatest
trouble is, and he'll snap it out with
just a couple of words —we need
! more tackles.
Line Reserves Needed
True, Stanford's first team is defi
! nitely about as strong as could be
| asked for, but more than eleven men
; are needed in most football games.
Stanford will have to replace men in
its fir.-I line from time to time and
i Tiny is worried about his tackle
! strength if Mr. Reynolds or Mr.
Beadle should contract an injury.
Then too, Tiny is still not positive
that Beadle can handle his new job
j well enough. There's no denying,
he's big enough and weighs well
over 2fK) pounds but tackles have to
move fast these days and Beadle
may lack the necessary speed. In
practice so far he's been measuring
right up to the requirements, how
i ever.
There's been a lot of talk about
: senioritis, more commonly known as
over-confidence. A lot of people
i seem to think that just because these
: fellows have been getting a lot of
' publicity, have won a lot of games
in the last two years, and are seniors,
I they ought to be mighty proud.
Remember Rose Bowl
But two nasty defeats in the Rose
Bowl have done a lot to them, too.
These fellows know, after spending
most of their lives playing the game,
that football players are like apples
-when they get ripe they start to
get rotten —and will probably reach
their ripening point just when they
want t6, and not before.
Saturday afternoon in Stanford's
Stadium they start things off for
1935. San Jose State will bring a
squad of relatively unknown
strength to the Farm to put the
much publicized Cards on the test
ing block.
That the game will be anything
more than a "breather" is improbable
but Tiny and his men are not taking
it any too lightly. Every team Stan
ford meets will be ready to sacrifice
all to upset the Indian and San Jose
will be no exception.
Practice Is Routine
Last night the sun had almost set
when Thornhill finally gave the
word that broke up an afternoon's
practice of blocking for the linemen,
passing for the backs.
And yesterday was no diffei'ent
from many another, except that Fred
Williams was out of uniform to give
his "cold" a break and Alec Trom
pas was giving way to a persistent
case of poison oak.
Thomhill is not sure as to when
he will send his charges through a
second scrimmage session, the first
being last Saturday's frosh-varsity
tangle, but he expressed the belief
that it would be "either tomorrow
or Wednesday."
