# Appropriation Gives Further Aid To WPA
## Non-Federal Projects To Receive Benefits Of New Grants 
### 
WASHINGTON, Sept. 23 (/P). —
The Works Progress Administra
tion's cash register today rang up an
additional $800,000,000 intended to
stimulate its dragging campaign to
transfer 3,500,000 individuals from
the dole to jobs by November 1.
One of the first official acts of the
President upon returning to the cap
ital from Hyde Park, N.Y., was to
add this sum to the $900,000,000 set
aside in the work-relief act for loans
or grants of non-federal works proj
ects.
WPA officials said broad cuts in
funds ior such activities as highway
construction, grade crossing elimina
tion, and rural rehabilitation and
electrification would be necessary to
obtain the $800,000,000. But no au
thoritative predictions were ventured
on just where the curtailments
would fall.
With only 936,000 persons moved
from relief rolls to payrolls at the
close of last week, WPA faced the
gigantic task of creating an average
of more than 64,000 jobs daily to
reach the November goal.
Another branch of the works pro
grain, relied on by officials to pro
vide directly and indirectly around
300,000 jobs in the next year, was vir
tually ready to get underway. Sec
retary Ickes told a gathering of all
state public works administrators
that a new list of PWA projects were
ready tonight to lay before the
President.
He advised his state lieutenants to
avoid "show case projects" and
"playing politics."
