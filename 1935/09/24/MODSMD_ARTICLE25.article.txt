# Chappie' Old Boy' Considers Laughs For First Edition
## 
### 
I stood toying nervously with a
sledge-hammer in the editorial of
fice of the Stanford Chaparral while
the new "old boy," Jim Copp, picked
on his typewriter. He was trying to
think of all the things that were to
go into the new edition of "Chap
pie," and when he had finished his
list looked like this:
1. Gordie Steedman, last year's
OLD BOY, tells of his experiences
during his eight years as a freshman
in "My Life as a Freshman."
2. Jean Rouverol, of Stanford and
also Hollywood, will tell what she
thinks of Roble meals.
3. "Ciiappie" reveals for the first
time just what goes into some of
those Encina Commons recipes—
plus an interview between head chef
and applicants for the job of cook
at the Commons.
4. Dorman H. Smith, now of the
Chicago Herald-Examiner, will con
tribute some of his drawings.
5. Gilman Gist offers a full page
of cartoons on a "back to the farm"
idea.
There was only one thing the new
odiLor was a bit hazy on. He didn't
know when the new edition was
coming out and it's quite possible he
didn't know if it was coming out.
He did have the ninth and tenth of
October circled on the calendar, and
ii no one can think of what it was
circled for, the October issue may
be oliered then.
