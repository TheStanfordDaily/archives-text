# 'Use Your Head'-- Says Campus Cop
## 
### BOB EISENBACII 
"Just use your head." i
That, according to campus traffic
officer Gordon Davis, is the secret of
good driving. It is also the one
thing Stanford students should be
able to do.
Gordie, believe it or not, doesn't
like to give out tickets. Veterans in
the ways of campus characters j
know him as a square fellow, one
whom they like personally and re
spect officially.
His job is to watch you when j
you're not watching yourself; to
catch the boys and girls who go
screaming at 60 per down Palm ;
Drive, teasing Mr. Fate into a re
vengeful mood.
Saves Drivers' Lives
How many speeders' lives he's
saved with a ticket is a subject for !
speculation. But he's there also to
catch you when you go through an '
arterial stop, or bowling up to the
library steps, offenses that never yet !
have taken lives, but have taken a |
little joy from them.
Gordy drives an inconspicuous i
and unmarked four-cylinder Ford
roadster, should you be interested, j
But with its aid he can catch the
snakiest luxury car that ever slunk j
down campus by-ways, and he's i
going to continue to do just that, i
To Bear Down Bard
"We intend to bear down hard j
this quarter," he declares. "Last i
year we had more arrests than ever |
before, and with prospects of the
largest enrollment in history, our i
job will be the biggest ever."
Rules of the campus driving game 1
are few, Gordy reveals. There's a j
30-mile per hour limit on Palm j
Drive and adjacent roads. There's
a limit of three in the front seat, ;
with running board hangers-on pro- j
hibited. Arterial stops tell their
own story. Parking is limited to
areas so defined.
New Cars at Fault
Speeding, Gordy reveals, isn't al
ways the fault of the driver. Today
campusites drive high-powered new
cars instead of the rheumatic wrecks
of three or four years ago that I
couldn't do more than 30 miles per 1
hour. Modern autos are built to do '
60 without effort, and without the i
driver's knowledge if he isn't watch- j
ing the speedometer."
"Consider the other fellow. If
he's ahead of you, let him stay I

there. If he gets to the movie 15
seconds before you do, the world
will never know it. If you get there
first—theoretically, you may never
arrive—actually."
Traffic Laws Altered
New traffic laws, recently embod
ied in the revised Motor Vehicle
Act, make drunken driving a fel
ony. Speed on intersections on state
highways is 30 miles per hour re
gardless of visibility.
"Negligent homicide," now part
of the state criminal code, makes the
driver, guilty of injuring another
motorist or pedestrian, liable for his
death, should it occur within one
year following the accident and as
a result of injuries sustained in the
accident."
Conscience Is Needed
All of which rules Gordy defines
as "compulsory intelligence," a nec
essary but inadequate help to the
instinctive knowledge of right and
wrong—in his opinion the best of
all ticket protectives.
. Campus tags, if you get one, are
disposable only through the Men's
Council, which levies fines accord
ing to its judgment of the offense.
It's a cash only proposition, for if
you're flush enough to own a car,
you're flush enough to pay, says col
lege law.

Saves Drivers' Lives
How many speeders' lives he's
saved with a ticket is a subject for !
speculation. But he's there also to
catch you when you go through an '
arterial stop, or bowling up to the
library steps, offenses that never yet !
have taken lives, but have taken a |
little joy from them.
Gordy drives an inconspicuous i
and unmarked four-cylinder Ford
roadster, should you be interested, j
But with its aid he can catch the
snakiest luxury car that ever slunk j
down campus by-ways, and he's i
going to continue to do just that, i
To Bear Down Bard
"We intend to bear down hard j
this quarter," he declares. "Last i
year we had more arrests than ever |
before, and with prospects of the
largest enrollment in history, our i
job will be the biggest ever."
Rules of the campus driving game 1
are few, Gordy reveals. There's a j
30-mile per hour limit on Palm j
Drive and adjacent roads. There's
a limit of three in the front seat, ;
with running board hangers-on pro- j
hibited. Arterial stops tell their
own story. Parking is limited to
areas so defined.
New Cars at Fault
Speeding, Gordy reveals, isn't al
ways the fault of the driver. Today
campusites drive high-powered new
cars instead of the rheumatic wrecks
of three or four years ago that I
couldn't do more than 30 miles per 1
hour. Modern autos are built to do '
60 without effort, and without the i
driver's knowledge if he isn't watch- j
ing the speedometer."
"Consider the other fellow. If
he's ahead of you, let him stay I

there. If he gets to the movie 15
seconds before you do, the world
will never know it. If you get there
first—theoretically, you may never
arrive—actually."
Traffic Laws Altered
New traffic laws, recently embod
ied in the revised Motor Vehicle
Act, make drunken driving a fel
ony. Speed on intersections on state
highways is 30 miles per hour re
gardless of visibility.
"Negligent homicide," now part
of the state criminal code, makes the
driver, guilty of injuring another
motorist or pedestrian, liable for his
death, should it occur within one
year following the accident and as
a result of injuries sustained in the
accident."
