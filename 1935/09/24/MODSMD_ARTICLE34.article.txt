# Ethiopia Faces Italy Undaunted by Odds
## Reject Duce Demands For Rich Land Grants As Peace Pricc 
### 
ADDIS ABABA, Sept. 23 (/P).—
Indignant Ethiopian officials tonight
termed "crazy" and "preposterous"
the reported demands of Italy for a
grant of rich land in return for
peace.
Emperor Haile Selassie engaged
in secret and important conferences
at the palace with feudal lords and
his foreign advisers. His spokesman
reiterated the Empire will never ac
cept any agreement between Great
Britain and France on one hand and
Italy on the other which would par
tition Ethiopia into spheres of eco
nomic and political influence.
Dangerous
Any grant such as that reported
proposed by II Duce's representa
tives a tGeneva would leave Ethio
pia with little more than mountains
and deserts, Selassie's spokesman
said. Moreover, it will greatly in- j
crease the danger of invasion in the
future.
"The only territory the Emperor
is willing to cede is Ogaden and ;
Assua provinces, and then only for i
cash revenues usable in the national
development of Ethiopia," asserted
the spokesman.
Railroad Okehcd
"He might be willing also to per
mit Italians to build a railroad link
ing Eritrea and Italian Somaliland i
but excluding territorial conces- j
sions, and specific economic zones or i
special political rights to Italy con
tiguous to the railroad."
The officials also regarded with
deep disfavor the reported Italian j
stipulation that any Ethiopian ac
cess to the sea be through Italian
territory.
They said any grant of territory
linking Eritrea and Italian Somali
land would deprive Ethiopia of i
much of her most fertile provinces j
and would give Italy rich gold and
platinum land as well as valuable
coffee plantations over an area of j
100,000 square miles.
