this fall, the prospect for the var- i
sity polo team looks encouraging, ;
according to Captain Laydon I. !
Grubbs, officer-in-charge and coach j
of one University polo.

Rogers created quite a hole in the !
lorward wall, promising material j
A*om last year's "B" and "C" squads i
is expected to fill in the gap left by |
Rogers and form a new winning j
combination. The returning mem- |
bers of the 1935 varsity are Karl j
Beal, Bob Fullerton, and Rammy ;
Rasmussen. I
In an attempt to duplicate last I
year's interesting and ' successiul '
season, tentative matches with Uni- j
versity of Southern California, Uni- i
versity of Arizona, the San Mateo |
Polo Club, and other nearby schools
are being scheduled. The three
squads will be chosen early in Octo

as possible after registration day. i
Students of the University wishing I
to use the government horses must I
enroll in the R.0.T.C., Coach Grubbs !
