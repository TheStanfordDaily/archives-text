ADDIS ABABA, Sept. 23 (£>).—
After years of obscurity, Prince
Louis de Bourbon, who claims to be
half-brother of former King Alfonso
of Spain, turned up dramatically at
this capital this week-end offering
loans to Ethiopia and seeking con
cessions.
But he left today, discouraged and
empty handed.
fie explained he had come di
rectly from Washington. Pressed
for details he said he represented
a New York banker.
The Prince said he came to Ethi
opia in response to an invitation
from the government and, as proof,
exhibited a cablegram which he said
was sent him in Athens by the Ethi
opian Foreign Minister.
Slight Error
The cablegram read: "You may
come at our expense." To the
Prince's sorrow, however, the gov
ernment said the little word "our"
should have read "your."
Thereupon the Prince bade fare
well to Emperor Haile Selassie,
whom he described as charming, but
lacking money. The Prince departed
for Harrar, where he said he hoped
to obtain funds to defray his return
to Europe.
