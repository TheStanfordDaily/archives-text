# Theater Work To Be Started In November
## New Building Scheduled For 1937 Completion At $500,000 Cost 
### 
Although .ground - breaking has
been postponed tentatively until the
beginning of November, Stanford
will have a new theater. That was
made definite yesterday by Comp
troller Almon E. Roth.
The delay, says Roth, was not
caused by financial difficulties. A
complete plan for payment has
been mapped out, and will result
in a structure costing more than
$500,000.
An impressive list of experts were
consulted this summer about tech
nical details for the stage, and then
suggestions have been incorporated
into the final plans. Lee Simonson,
head scene designer for the Theater
Guild in New York, offered several
valuable comments.
Irving Pichcl, actor-director at
RKO and once a Broadway director,
was also interviewed by Phil Brown,
in charge of the working details of
the theater, and so was Kenneth
MacGowan, producer at Twentieth
Century-Fox and also experienced
on Broadway. Brown has assembled
their ideas, which he thinks will re
sult in a technically perfect theater
from the actor's standpoint.
Approximately one year will be
required to finish the building after
actual ground' - breaking. This
means that, according to present
plans, returning students in win
ter quarter of 1937 will view the
finished structure.
The Stanford Board of Trustees
have officially approved construc
tion of the Memorial Theater, and
have also okayed financial arrange
ments which call for the payment
of one dollar per quarter from each
student. This makes the tuition $115
instead of tlie 1934 total of $114.
University architects Bakewell
and Brown have completed plans for
the building, and engineer's plans
are almost finished. The building
will be of the finest earthquake
proof construction, and will be lo
cated on the plot of ground near the
ruins of the old library. It will face
the chemistry building on the op
posite side of the plot of ground in
front of the administration building.
Workshops complete with stages,
dressing rooms, property rooms,
and a completely fitted stage are
all included in the structure. It
will acommodatc 1522 people, but
sections may be closed off so as
to cut the seats to a minimum ca
pacity of 810 or 712 persons. There
will also be a little theater of IS4
seats.
Aiding in paying for the building
will be half of ail Union profits after
this year and the Memorial Fund
established after the war. Bronze
plaques in the foyer will commemo
rate Stanford war heroes.

instead of tlie 1934 total of $114.
University architects Bakewell
and Brown have completed plans for
the building, and engineer's plans
are almost finished. The building
will be of the finest earthquake
proof construction, and will be lo
cated on the plot of ground near the
ruins of the old library. It will face
the chemistry building on the op
posite side of the plot of ground in
front of the administration building.
Workshops complete with stages,
dressing rooms, property rooms,
and a completely fitted stage are
all included in the structure. It
will acommodatc 1522 people, but
sections may be closed off so as
to cut the seats to a minimum ca
pacity of 810 or 712 persons. There
will also be a little theater of IS4
seats.
Aiding in paying for the building
will be half of ail Union profits after
this year and the Memorial Fund
established after the war. Bronze
plaques in the foyer will commemo
rate Stanford war heroes.
Although .ground - breaking has
been postponed tentatively until the
beginning of November, Stanford
will have a new theater. That was
made definite yesterday by Comp
troller Almon E. Roth.
The delay, says Roth, was not
caused by financial difficulties. A
complete plan for payment has
been mapped out, and will result
in a structure costing more than
$500,000.
An impressive list of experts were
consulted this summer about tech
nical details for the stage, and then
suggestions have been incorporated
into the final plans. Lee Simonson,
head scene designer for the Theater
Guild in New York, offered several
valuable comments.
Irving Pichcl, actor-director at
RKO and once a Broadway director,
was also interviewed by Phil Brown,
in charge of the working details of
the theater, and so was Kenneth
MacGowan, producer at Twentieth
Century-Fox and also experienced
on Broadway. Brown has assembled
their ideas, which he thinks will re
sult in a technically perfect theater
from the actor's standpoint.
Approximately one year will be
required to finish the building after
actual ground' - breaking. This
means that, according to present
plans, returning students in win
ter quarter of 1937 will view the
finished structure.
The Stanford Board of Trustees
have officially approved construc
tion of the Memorial Theater, and
have also okayed financial arrange
ments which call for the payment
of one dollar per quarter from each
student. This makes the tuition $115
instead of tlie 1934 total of $114.
