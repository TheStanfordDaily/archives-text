# DIANA'S DIARY
## 
### Co-ed Reporter 
Sept. 24. Dear Diary—lt's grand
to be back at Stanford—l'm really
glad that my senior year started a
week early. I blew into the house
(it's completely renovated with the
divinest lavender showers) just in
time for lunch today and fifteen
minutes later Jerry, the dear lad,
phoned about the Reg dance tonight.
Course I accepted and then panicked
about clothes. A summer on a dude
ranch does leave one's wardrobe in
a bad way. So I only stopped twice
to quibble over whose bed was
whose before I was off to shop in
Paly. I swear I don't possess a pre
sentable stitch so first stop was
MARIAN SEIMAS, 534 Ramona,
where I fell for a swank tailored
slip—in tea rose crepe and a steal
at $1.95. I'd been hearing things
about Paly's new dress shop so I
marched right down to MARY
ELIZABETH'S, 119 University, and
am still breathless. The owner's a
Stanford grad and knows what we
gals want. I loved them all but
settled on an afternoon silk in black
crepe. It's very simple with che
nille on the sleeves and a small turn
down collar of rhinestone, but it has
lines that tell. I got a hat to match
too—one of thoes new bonnets that
tilt off the face and have an alluring
little widow's peak in front. Shoes
came next so I went to the WALK
OVER, 220 University, where I
pranced out of the store in a pair of
black T-strap suedes with patent
trim that gave my feet the most
aristocratic air they've yet enjoyed.
Jerry likes his women feminine and

since Lucille Le Long's perfume
comes first for that subtle some
thing, next stop was at J. JAY
BAKER'S, 571 Ramona. And after
that out-door summer, my face is
hardly my fortune, so I decided to
try the introductory set of Alex
andra de Markoff cosmetics the
UNIVERSITY PHARMACY, 134
University, has for a two weeks'
offer. It's simply marvelous! Prac
tical notes on this shopping tour
were stopping off at the ASSOCI
ATED STENOGRAPHERS, 266 Uni
versity, to arrange for them to type
those nasty weekly papers, and buy
ing stationery at WIGHTMAN'S,
366 University. From their swell se
lection I picked some of the new
blue that is so smart now. My room
is in sad need of a lamp and I was
lucky enough to find the DE LEMOS
STUDIO, 520 Ramona, where I
bought a super-modern chromium
desk lamp that's the envy of the
sorority. All of the gals are raving
about the THREE SAILORS, 337
Hamilton, and their personal service
department—they're noted on the
campus as roomer fixer uppers. Was
just interrupted by the arrival of
flowers—a corsage from Jerry and
am I thrilled! It's a beauty from
THE FLOWER SHOP, 175 Univer
sity—one of those original Stanfordy
corsages of red and white tubrous
begonias. Jerry's sweet and I'm glad
he didn't see me before I got a new
cut and wave at LYDIA'S, 460 Uni
versity. I've certainly missed her
hair dressing this summer. Well it's
about time to dress for the dance, so
good-bye 'til next week.

week early. I blew into the house
(it's completely renovated with the
divinest lavender showers) just in
time for lunch today and fifteen
minutes later Jerry, the dear lad,
phoned about the Reg dance tonight.
Course I accepted and then panicked
about clothes. A summer on a dude
ranch does leave one's wardrobe in
a bad way. So I only stopped twice
to quibble over whose bed was
whose before I was off to shop in
Paly. I swear I don't possess a pre
sentable stitch so first stop was
MARIAN SEIMAS, 534 Ramona,
where I fell for a swank tailored
slip—in tea rose crepe and a steal
at $1.95. I'd been hearing things
about Paly's new dress shop so I
marched right down to MARY
ELIZABETH'S, 119 University, and
am still breathless. The owner's a
Stanford grad and knows what we
gals want. I loved them all but
settled on an afternoon silk in black
crepe. It's very simple with che
nille on the sleeves and a small turn
down collar of rhinestone, but it has
lines that tell. I got a hat to match
too—one of thoes new bonnets that
tilt off the face and have an alluring
little widow's peak in front. Shoes
came next so I went to the WALK
OVER, 220 University, where I
pranced out of the store in a pair of
black T-strap suedes with patent
trim that gave my feet the most
aristocratic air they've yet enjoyed.
Jerry likes his women feminine and

since Lucille Le Long's perfume
comes first for that subtle some
thing, next stop was at J. JAY
BAKER'S, 571 Ramona. And after
that out-door summer, my face is
hardly my fortune, so I decided to
try the introductory set of Alex
andra de Markoff cosmetics the
UNIVERSITY PHARMACY, 134
University, has for a two weeks'
offer. It's simply marvelous! Prac
tical notes on this shopping tour
were stopping off at the ASSOCI
ATED STENOGRAPHERS, 266 Uni
versity, to arrange for them to type
those nasty weekly papers, and buy
ing stationery at WIGHTMAN'S,
366 University. From their swell se
lection I picked some of the new
blue that is so smart now. My room
is in sad need of a lamp and I was
lucky enough to find the DE LEMOS
STUDIO, 520 Ramona, where I
bought a super-modern chromium
desk lamp that's the envy of the
sorority. All of the gals are raving
about the THREE SAILORS, 337
Hamilton, and their personal service
department—they're noted on the
campus as roomer fixer uppers. Was
just interrupted by the arrival of
flowers—a corsage from Jerry and
am I thrilled! It's a beauty from
THE FLOWER SHOP, 175 Univer
sity—one of those original Stanfordy
corsages of red and white tubrous
begonias. Jerry's sweet and I'm glad
he didn't see me before I got a new
cut and wave at LYDIA'S, 460 Uni
versity. I've certainly missed her
hair dressing this summer. Well it's
about time to dress for the dance, so
good-bye 'til next week.
Sept. 24. Dear Diary—lt's grand
to be back at Stanford—l'm really
glad that my senior year started a
week early. I blew into the house
