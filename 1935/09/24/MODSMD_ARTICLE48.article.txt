# Cellar Misses Literary Note; Library Ends
## 
### 
"Old-timers," vintage '34, shed a
figurative tear today as they crashed
down the Union Cellar steps for the
quarter's first "snailanacuppacoffee."
For up where the New Republic,
Liberty, Terror Tales, and Anthony
Adverse once lived in unique har
mony is northing but a noncommittal
cellar bench.
Gone! with Don Brown, class poet
of the '35's, is his literary oasis, his
chicken-wire barriers, and the sim
ple pleasure of a booky bull session
and a nidle thumbing of the newest
magazines.
Successor to his circulating li
brary is a case-hardened magazine
rack, standing at the nether end of
the cigar counter. There, surround
ed by pipes that beg to be smoked
and supernaturally perfect shaving
balms, you'll find football mags and
commercial spine-chillers, with just
a mixture of literary "class."
The cgiar-counter crew will sup
ply your literary entertainment, in
the sudden emergency of the new
quarter, with pulp-paper anaesthet
ics.
But they promise, as soon as they
get the hang of it, to install a de
partment of the serious and signifi
cant â€”just in case.
