# Dividers Given Out on Campus
## 
### 
Thirty-five hundred folder divid
ers will be distributed free of charge
to Stanford students, v/ith twice the
advertising ever gathered before.
The copies have been left in each
room of the rrjen's dormitories, and
in the lobbies of Roble, Lagunita,
and all fraternities and sororities.
Marvie Kahn, last quarter's stu
dent body president, Ben Cave, stu
dent manager, and John Martin
supervised the printing. They chose
blue and red as color scheme, in a
size corresponding to that of a stand
ard three-hole folder.
Ads submitted by Palo Alto busi
ness men paid all expenses of the
publication. The large amount of
advertising piled up an impressive
profit, which will be divided among
the three publicationsâ€”the Stan
ford Daily, Chaparral, and Quad,
pnd a share also going to the A.S.
S.U. treasury.
