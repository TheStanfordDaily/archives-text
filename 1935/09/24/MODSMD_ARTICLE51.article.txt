# Yell Men Originate New Rooters' Cheer
## 
### 
Hold ydur hats, folks! Stanford
has a new yell.
It's short, but it packs a wallop,
says Dick Stark, head yell leader.
And it's the result of a summer's
head-pounding by Stark, Web Jones
and Tal Shelton, assistant yell lead
ers.
"We're well aware of campus
skepticism when a new yell is in
troduced," Stark says. "We're ask
ing you only to delay judgment un
til this one has its test in the root
ing section."
Here 'tis:
W ah who W ah
W ah who W ah
War Cry
Stan—Stanford Stan —Stanford
StaaanFOßD
And here's Stark's greeting — a
handy compendium of what to shout
when the Indians go through the
goalposts:
STANFORD YELLS
Big Six
(For the Varsity, the Frosh, visit
ing teams, the band, or any emer
gency. Yell leader's axiom—when
in doubt give "six.")
Stanford Varsity—Rah, Rah, Rah,
Rah, Rah, Rah—Stanford Varsity!
Spell It
(Pronounce each letter after the
leader.)
S T A N
F — O — R — D
STANford, STANford, StanFORD!

Sky Rocket
(For coaches and captains only.)
SKYYYYY Rocket! -
(Whistle) BOOM AH
COACH TINY THORNHILL!
New Spell
(Given twice through. First,:
slowly and softly; second, loudlyj
and very fast.)
Stee — N For — D
Stee — N For — D
Stee N For D
Stee N For D j
STANford, STANford, StanFORD! !
The Axe
(This yell became Stanford's per- j
manent possession when Sequoia's
famous "21" retrieved the axe in
1930 from California. The Axe tra- ;
dition makes this yell the most out
standing of the Stanford repertoire.)
Give 'em the Axe
The Axe the Axe
Give 'em the Axe
The Axe the Axe
Give 'em the Axe
Give 'em the Axe
Give 'em the Axe WHERE?
Right in the Neck
The Neck the Neck
Right in the Neck
The Neck the Neck
Right in the Neck
Right in the Neck
Right in the Neck THERE!
(Slowly and deliberately the first
time, but hold your hats on the
second delivery.)
