INTRODUCTION: At the time;
i this column is being written, it is 1
still without a name, the editor not |
! yet having decided on one. Which
| leaves me with a strange feeling. I
| Despite whatever title may appear J
, above, the object of this new feature i
i is to bring you the news, gossip, and ;
j not too scandalous scandal of what
J can best be lumped under the title,
i "show business."
The column originated in the
i Summer Daily, where it was called 1
' "Rialto Ramblings," but our Mr. i
! Jones, who edits this modest little |
' journal, issued an editorial edict to I
j the effect that "Rialto" reminded j
him of all the cheap theaters of the !
same name, so the title has been ;
changed to whtaever appears "away
j up thar."
I A FEW SAMPLES: Fred War- '
I ing's radio shows are recorded "off j
I the air" and released on various j
| European stations for the same
| sponsor. . . . The same practice is j
i followed by "Showboat," only their
! foreign release is in China. . . .
j "Hell's Angels" is still in the red,
! but earning $200 to $300 a week.
I For instance, it's playing in Chi
cago this week. . . . Benny Good
man used to be with Richard Him
ber's orchestra. ... As was Kel j
1 Murray, who directed one of the
| orchestras on that three-hour Sat- 1
; urday night marathon last spring.
... "Top. Hat" holds the Radio City
l Music Hall house record for box

office grosses. The first week it did
$130,000, and the next week it took
second place with $112,000.
TYPICALLY HEARST: Last Sun
day's "Chicago Herald and Exam
iner" carried a picture of
Dietrich sunning herself. The legend
said, among other things, that she
"spends every available moment re
laxing in the sunlight." It is a
well-known fact that La Dietrich
is a heliophobe, one of those per
sons who can't stand sunlight!
MUSIC NOTES: "Wished on the
Moon," Bing Crosby's new tune
from "The Big Broadcast of 1936,"
is one of those melodies with which
Ray Noble and Carrol Gibbons can
do plenty. . . . And Brooks Bow
man of Princeton's Triangle Club de
serves a plug for his swell tunes
from "Stags at Bay." "Love and a
Dime" and "East of the Sun." The
words to the latter strike me as

| showing much more imagination
than is usual in popular music.
OVERHEARD in a San Francisco
i hotel lobby: "Let's go up to the
J Comstock Room and get a Lode."
