# Baby in St. Louis Claimed by Two Different Women
## 
### 
ST. LOUIS, Sept. 23 (/P).â€”'Two
"mothers," each claiming parentage '
of a month-old baby, today were
ordered to present their arguments
in court here Wednesday morning.
Judge Wiiliam Dee Back, the Sol
omon in the case, instructed Mrs.
Nellie Tipton Muench, 43-year-old
former society matron and alleged
kidnaper, to bring the child before
the St. Louis court of appeals.
He issued his order after a writ
of habeas corpus was obtained by
Anna Ware, 19-year-old unmarried
mother of Newton, Pa., who as
serted the child belonged to her.
It was alleged in the application
for the writ that Mrs. Muench and
her husband, Dr. Ludwig Muench,
a St. Louis physician, arranged with
other persons to bring Miss Ware to
St. Louis and thus obtain custody of
her as yet unborn child.
Mrs. Muench, several days later,
announced the birth of a boy on
August 18 at her home. A birth cer
tificate later was filed by Dr.
Muench as attending physician.
When she announced the birth,
Mrs. Muench termed it a "gift" from
God to console her in her time of
need. She had been childless
through 23 years of married life.
