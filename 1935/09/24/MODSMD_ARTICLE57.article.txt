# Men's Chorus To Reorganize
## 
### 
The Stanford Glee Club, under
the direction of Mr. Harry Perry, is
completely reorganizing with well
balanced selections augmented by
talent of individual entertainment
replacing the well-known concerts
of former years.
Mr. Perry has been with the cho
rus of the Olympic Club, the glee
club of the Bohemian Club, and
choruses of the San Francisco Opera
Company. He is noted for his ability
to appeal to every audience.
Possible engagements in Los An
geles at the time of the U.S.C.-Stan
ford game, in San Francisco at the
time of the Big Game, and a winter
tour in Northern California are bait
for tryou tees.
Members will hold their first
meeting Wednesday, September 25,
at 7:30 b'clock. Tryouts for new
men will start on Monday, Septem
ber 30, at 7:45 o'clock and be con
tinued on Wednesday and Monday,
October 2 and 7. Meetings will
again be held in the Old Roble
Gymnasium.
