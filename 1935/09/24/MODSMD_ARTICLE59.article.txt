WASHINGTON, Sept. 23 (/P). â€”
Treasury officials reported all speed
records of the Bureau of Engraving
and Printing for producing postage
stamps were broken today when
pressas, at noon, started turning out
the new 3-cent Boulder Dam stamps.
The engraving of a new stamp
plate normally takes three weeks,
officials said, but in this instance
two expert engravers, alternating in
12-hour shift, completed their job
in one week's time.
