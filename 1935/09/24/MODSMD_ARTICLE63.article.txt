## Change of Venue Petition Starts New Trouble Between Councils 
###

terday in the court of Superior
Judge Robert R. Syer in San Jose
for the third trial of David A. Lam
son, former Stanford Press execu
tive who is accused of slaying his

Charges were made by Deputy
Prosecutor Allan P. Lindsay that
some of the 800 signatures secured
by friends of Lamson during the past
summer asking a change of venue
for Lamson were obtained under
false pretenses; counter charges were
hurled by Defense Attorney Edwin
M. Rea that the district attorney's of
fice has attempted to intimidate peti
tion signers and defense witnesses.
Arguments for a change of venue
will be presented by defens attor
neys before Judge Syer on Monday,
September 30.
A brief summary of the case to
date follows:
On May 30, 1933, Lamson found
the bruised body of his wife in the
bathtub of his Stanford campus
home, when he was called into the
house to show it to a real estate
saleswoman. Mrs. Lamson's body
was mutilated by bruises on the
thigh and shin and a ring fracture
of the skull.
Previous to discovering the body,
Lamson had been working at the
rear of the house over a bonfire
from which the prosecution extracted
a cloth and pipe which were alleged
to have upon them traces of blood.
Lamson was arrested by Santa
Clara County Sheriff William Emig
and was brought to trial before Su
perior Judge R. R. Syer. On Sep
tember 16, 1933, he was found guilty
of murder and was sentenced to
hang. Lamson spent the next year
in San Quentin Penitentiary, where
he wrote, "We Who Are About To
Die."
A year after the close of the first
trial Lamson's case was appealed to
the Supreme Court of California,
which unanimously reversed the de
cision of the Santa Clara County
Superior Court. Four of the judges
reversed on grounds of insufficient
evidence. Lamson was returned to
the county jail in San Jose in No
vember, 1934, where he has since re
mained.
Lamson's second trial began in
February, 1935, continuing for 12
weeks when the jury was dead
locked, nine members favoring con
viction and three acquittal.
