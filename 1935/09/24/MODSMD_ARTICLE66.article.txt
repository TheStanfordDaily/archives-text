### 
SEATTLE. Sept. 23 (/P). â€” The
steamship W. M. Tupper and her '
sea-going dairy returned to port to- ;
day, and Chief Engineer E. B. Stone, I
who added Chief Herdsman to his
regular duties, was prepared to tell
the world of dairymen that sea air i
and Alaskan scenery will do won- ,
ders in increasing milk production.
The Tupper, on her final voyage
of the season to the far North, car
ried a milch cow which was cared
for on the 2300-mile, 37-day voyage
by the chief of the steamship's
"black gang." The cow furnished
milk for passengers and crew and i
was giving two gallons more a day I
when the steamship docked than [
when it departed.
