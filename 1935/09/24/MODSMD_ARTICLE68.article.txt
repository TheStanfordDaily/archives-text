## 
### 
Only minor changes are to be
made in fraternity and sorority
rushing this fall, according to Ed
Littlefield, president of the Inter
fraternity Council, and Jeanne Kees
ling, Pan-Hellenic president.
Rushing schedules and regula
tions for both men and women have
been filed with the administration,
and official okehs will be forthcom
ing later in the week.
The two Row leaders appeared
satisfied with the rushing program
as carried out in 1934-35, and the
dates and regulations already sub
mitted for approval follow closely
those of last year.
There will be the series of three
or four short periods of contact in
which the freshmen and row dwell
ers will be allowed to mingle. Pledg
ing is again planned for January
for both men and women.
Jeanne Keesling expressed the
feelings of the women, saying that
too much rushing and too little
normal contact is the easiest way
out of the complex problem, and the
normal contact method is the most
satisfactory for both the rushers and
the rushees.
