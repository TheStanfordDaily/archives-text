### 
NEW YORK, Sept. 23 (/P). —
What was to have been the first
"rocket post office" fizzled with a
bang today, dashing to earth the
mail and hopes of a group of phila
telists and members of the Interna
tional Cosmo Science Club.
The letters were loaded into the
seven-foot rocket at the Holmes Air
port at Astoria, and the fuse was lit.
The rocket blew up on the ground,
sending Edward Vozab to the hospi
tal with a splinter in his arm.
What was left of the mail was
loaded into a second rocket. Up it
sizzled for all of 50 feet before it
fell apart, and it and the letters
drifted earthward. Remaining let
ters were taken to the Jamaica post
office and mailed in the conventional
way.
