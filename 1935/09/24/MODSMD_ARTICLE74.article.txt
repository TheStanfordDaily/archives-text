# Summer Season Teems With Artistic Activity
## 
### PHIL BERNHEIM 
As is usual, the Stanford summer
quarter was unusually rich in the
number of events of a more-or-less
artistic nature.
Before taking up the summer it
self, some mention should be made
of the "Follies Bourgeois," presented
just before the close of spring quar
ter.
Not the least important factors in
success of the "Follies" were Fred
Nagel's fine orchestra (the same one
that plays at Sigma Delta Chi's Reg
istration Dance tonight), Annelies
Morgan, and Stanford's eccentric
genius, Old Boy Jim Copp. Mack
Gordon's tunes were swell, but
rather obvious steals. Dave Mellin
koff and Bill Rogers deserve a hearty
plug for giving some real continuity.
First event of the summer quarter
was a concert by Felipe Delgado,
Spanish singer, in the Union Court.
Delgado sang his songs in costumes
native to the different Latin peoples.
Sword and Sandals filled the Stan
ford Radio Hour on July 8 with a
reading of the assassination scene
from "Julius Caesar."
Mrs. Guy Stevens Farrington gave
a reading of "Touch Wood," by C. L.
Anthony, the author of "Autumn
Crocus." The play, which is sched
uled for Broadway production this
winter, is an amusing drama of
philandering husbands and wives at
a Scottish, seaside resort, but it is
not in the flippant style of so many
modern plays on the same subject.
Sword and Sandals' first summer
quarter reading was "The Dark
Tower," a drama by Alexander
Woolcott and George S. Kaufman.
Outstanding was Annelies Morgan,
who again proved herself the out
standing actress on the campus with
her portrayal of a choleric old maid
servant.
Two concerts, one by Marya Os
trava of Slavic songs, and the other
by Ataloa of Indian, were not heard

by your reviewer. In place of one,
he went to the Sword and Sandals
reading of "Private Lives," which,
being a Coward play, couldn't miss.
Especial praise is due Rosemary
Benet for excellent work despite ob
vious miscasting.
The Pro Arte Quartet of Belgium
gave its usual summer series or
concerts here, the gift of Mrs. Eliza
beth Sprague Coolidge.
The most ambitious effort of the
quarter was the production of
"Othello" by the class in Shake
spearean production, directed ,by
William Thornton, who also played
the title role. Annelies Morgan
showed her versatility by playing
Desdemona, a part that was quite a
contrast from her delightful satire
in the spring "Follies." Sidney
Head gave a performance of lago,
one that was hailed by San Fran
cisco critics.
The final event of the quarter was
a reading of "Elizabeth the Queen"
by Maxwell Anderson, '14, given by
the staff of the course in Shake
spearean production. The title role
was taken by Dr. Margery Bailey of
the English department.
American football's present scrim
mage method was originated in 1880.
