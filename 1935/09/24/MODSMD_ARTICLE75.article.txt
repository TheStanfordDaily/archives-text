### 
NEW ORLEANS, Sept. 23 (/P;.—
Internal strife today threatened to
i dash the Long machine hopes for
victory in the January Democratic
primary while determined anti-
Long lorces of the state were laying
siege to the "dictatorship" left by
the late dominating Huey.
Under the leadership of Governor
O. K. Allen, who held his position
at the dictation of Long, the organi
zation sorely missed the guiding
hand of their assassinated leader
who hand-picked his election tick
ets and lost few races.
The shattered Long forces in their
! 24-hour caucus wrangling of Satur
day succeeded in harmonizing the
contending political ambitions in
their ranks with the exception of
the demand of James A. Noe, lieu
tenant governor and close political
friend of Senator Long, that his an
' nouncement for governor be en-
I dorsed.
