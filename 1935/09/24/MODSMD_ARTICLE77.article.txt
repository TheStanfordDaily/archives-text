# Menlo Water Okeh Claim of Manager
## 
### 
Reports that the water supply of
Menlo Park and Atherton is over
chlorinated and often contaminated
by nicnic grounds in the source area
were emphatically denied yesterday
by A. F. Poulter, manager of the
Bear Gulch Water Company, the
utility which serves the two com
munities.
"No water-borne disease has ever
been traced to our water supply,"
he said. "Daily examinations and
regular laboratory analysis prove
that the water throughout our sys
tem is absolutely free from any
contamination."
