provided. Formally called the As
sociated Students of Stanford Uni
versity.
THE AXE is a broad bladed in
strument similar to those used in
Nazi executions but now lacking a
handle. Created at Stanford, seized
by Cal, reseized by Stanford, it is
now the Big Game trophy, and by
virtue of a grid win last fall is now
chained in a glass case in Union
Cellar.
THE BAWL-OUT is a neat little
dish of dirt that supposedly re
veals the graded intelligence of
members of the A.S.S.U. (previously
defined). It costs 15 cents, tells
where everybody hails from, lists
the faculty, contains a few handy
phone numbers, and is an alleged
basis used by profs in giving grades.

Also a political faction and the ob
ject of the administration's boast of
Stanford democracy.
LOCK-OUTS are what make Stan
ford men prefer off-campus dates
and what make dated Stanford
women continually ask what time
it is. Technically the deadline when
wandering women must be safely
back in their cloistered quarters.
THE NEW THEATER is what
raised $114 to $115, what was long
hoped for, long promised. Aimed to
elevate Stanford dramatics to the

before the year is out.
ROW has the opposite meaning of
Hall and is the term applied to the
hallowed region occupied by fra
ternities and sororities. Also the
street on which bright new struc

a be jeweled pin; to go Hall is to have
janitor service and independence.
THE ROSE BOWL is the large de
piession in Pasadena where Stan
ford gathers on New Year's day and

Cal, S.C., and Washington it nearly
always goes to the Rose Bowl. Ef

year.
THE R.O.T.C. is the student unit
of Uncle Sam's artillery. With
about 75 horses, some A-l army of

the boys have a great time once a
week. Everything's freeâ€”even the
uniforms and horses.
THE TIME SCHEDULE is a
little folder that anyone can buy for
10 cents which tells which classes

two years they're a cinch to figure
out.

writers, windshield stickers, etc.,
may be purchased at the same prices

back on the cinders with the Olym
pic Club.
