"Within a month the new janitors'

The building, which is a one-story
frame stucco structure, is being
constructed by the American Build
ing Maintenance Company on
ground which has been leased from
the Univeristy. The length of the'
lease is 20 years, and at the end of
lhat time the building will become
the property of the University.
However, if at any time within the
time of the lease the contract is
canceled, the University is entitled
to purchase the building at one-half

lease.
Fifty single rooms, a social room,
dining room, and kitchen are in
cluded in the unit which will be
one of the best equipped buildings
of its kind anywhere. The old jani
tors' buildings are to be torn down
as soon as the new structure is oc
cupied in order to clear space for
construction of the new theater,
which is scheduled to start toward
the end of November.
