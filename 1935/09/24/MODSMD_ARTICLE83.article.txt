# National Cash Provides Jobs for Students
## Graduate, Undergraduate Work Projects Under Separate Heads 
### 
With more funds available for a
greater number of working students,
Stanford goes under the National
Youth Administration which re
places the SERA of the past two
years.
The NYA is essentially the same
as the SERA, and differs only in
that jobs for undergraduates and
graduate students are placed under
different supervision. Mrs. Irene W.
Coverley, executive assistant in the
appointment service, handles all un
dergraduate work, while John Ezra
McDowell, academic secretary, is in
charge of graduate jobs.
Must Prove Need
Eligibility for employment under
the NYA is determined by Mrs.
Coverley or McDowell upon appli
cation by the student who is re
quired to fill out an information
blank requesting NYA assistance
and proving his need for such aid.
The NYA grant allows a maximum
of $15 per month for undergrad
uates, $25 per month for first-year
graduates, and $30 per month for
graduate students who have com
pleted one year of graduate study.
If a student is assigned to a proj
ect, a payroll authorization is signed
by the student, approved by either
Mrs. Coverley or McDowell, and
filed in the accounting department. ;
Time cards should be secured by the
major department employing the
student, and each day : s employ- j
ment must be filled out by the stu- j
dent on these cards.
To Assist Students
The principal objective of using ,
relief funds for student aid is to in
crease the number of young men and
women going to college. Need, char- j
acter, and ability to do college or i
graduate work are primary factors |
in accepting and assigning students
for employment.
Mrs. Coverley stated that all stu
dents who have not yet filled out.
an information blank for NYA must
