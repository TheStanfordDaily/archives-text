# Cities Vie for Next Convention of Legion
## 
### 
ST. LOUIS, Sept. 23 (/P).â€”Foui
cities matched bathing beauties
against fishing, peaches against salt
water taffy and cash against cash
today as they sought the American
Legion's eighteenth annual conven
tion next year.
The committee on time and place,
after listening to the joys to be ex
pected at Cleveland, Denver, Atlan
tic City and Los Angeles, voted,
however, to throw the matter to the
convention floor for settlement Wed
nesday.

All stores in Rio de Janeiro have
steel fronts, just in case a revolution
happens along.
