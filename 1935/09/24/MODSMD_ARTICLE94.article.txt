Answers Questions
"What about the opportunities for
a successful career in the practice
of law?" was one of those questions
which Professor Brenner answered
in response to repeated queries by
prospective law students.
"We hear a great deal about the
overcrowded condition of the bar,"
said the associate professor, "but
reliable information is being made
available now that indicates there
is less overcroding in the field of
law today than there was fifteen or
more years ago."
Training Important
He went on to make the impor
tant qualification that "it is un
doubtedly tru# that there are too
many lawyers whq are not properly
qualified, but there appears to be
ample room for young lawyers of
real ability."
The professor ended with the im
portant warning to the would-be
lawyer that he should choose a law
school which is accredited by the
California State Bar Journal and
concluded that "the quality of
training is the basis for his success
in the legal profession."
