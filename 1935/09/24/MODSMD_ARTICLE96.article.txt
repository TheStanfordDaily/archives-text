Marking the beginning of the j
1935-36 debating season, manager
Wayne Richardson today issued a j
call for all interested students to I

begin at 4:00 p.m., is open to all I
students, whether or not they have i
had previous debating experience.!
According to manager Richardson,
the prospects lor this year's varsity

squad have been lost through grad
uation, a number of veteran de
baters will return and will be rein- j
forced by last year's championship
freshman team.
An extensive schedule of debates 1
is being planned for the coming j
year, including a series of trips to !
other universities. Plans call for :
several trips into the Pacific North- !
west as well as meetings with Cali- j
fornia debaters. An ambitious proj- i
ect for a trans-Pacific excursion, I
calling lor visits to Hawaii, China, |
and Japan, is under consideration.
Stanford's debating team, holders
of the western division champion
ship won at Salt Lake last fall, look
forward to another successful year
under the leadership of coach Le
land Chapin.
Freshman as well as varsity can- 1
didates are urged to be present at 1
the opening meeting on Friday.
