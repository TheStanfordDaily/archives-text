## F.D. Meets Chiefs Prior To West Coast Trip 
### 
WASHINGTON, Sept. 24 (IP). â€”
Gathering his lieutenants around
him, President Roosevelt today
sought to oil the cogs of his works
relief and social security machinery
before his proposed departure for
the West Coast Thursday.
Trekking to the White House dur
ing the busy day were the chiefs of
his works progress, public works,
and social security units. From each
he received a report and with them
discussed future moves.
Coal Strike Disregarded
The coal strike apparently re
ceived no particular attention from
Mr. Roosevelt, although a regular
Cabinet meeting at which attend
ance of the Labor Secretary is
rtoutine afforded opportunity for
consideration.
One of the callers was John G.
Winant, new head of the social se
curity board. With him, Mr. Roose
velt arranged to put the board on a
skeleton basis until funds for carry
ing out the program are made avail
able by the next Congress.
Hopkins, Ickes Call
Two other conferees were Secre
tary Ickes, PWA chief, and Harry L.
Hopkins, relief administrator. They
have been in sharp argument over
how to spend the four billion dollar
works fund.
Hopkins, accompanied by Secre
tary Wallace, sketched for Mr.
Roosevelt plans for road construc
tion as part of the relief program.
Ickes reported on the effort to shape
a program of permanent works out
of the thousands of applications
submitted the PWA.
