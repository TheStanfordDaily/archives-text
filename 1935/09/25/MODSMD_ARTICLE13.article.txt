# Former NRA Head Praises Code Loyalty
## Richberg Concedes Code Abandonment Brought No Dire Results 
### 
WASHINGTON, Sept. 24 (A>).—
Donald R. Richberg, in his first
comment on public issues since re
tiring as chairman of the National
Recovery Board, today conceded the
abandonment of NRA had not
brought the dire results he forecast.
Instead, Richberg said, the in
dustrial chaos he warned would
follow NRA's abandonment had
been averted by business improve
ment and widespread adherence
to code' standards made possible
' by "collective thinking" taught
business men under the recovery
law.
These observations were made
| during an interview in Richberg's
j newly-furnished law office, over
looking the White House, where only
three months ago he was one of
President Roosevelt's closest advis
ers in charting the nation's course.
Enjoys Freedom
Almost constantly in the headlines
until three months ago, Richberg has
since dropped completely out of the
public view. He said be was "en
joying the freedom of it and the
; lack of two great responsibilities,"
j and would continue his quiet life
I for some time to come.
Richberg now is devoting much of
his time to the writing of a book
about NRA. He explained it would
j be a philosophical analysis and his
tory of the Recovery Administration
! and would not deal with personali
j ties. He said it would not be an
answer to the book written by
j Hugh S. Johnson, former adminis
trator, in which Richberg was
| sharply criticized.
Problems Remain
! "NRA was a very big thing in
! American life and one of the most
i significant developments of the de
j pression period," he said. "Though
it is gone, those problems must be
dealt with one way or another,
j What is most needed is a crystalliza
j tion of the real issues involved in
i the conflict of economic interests.
"There hasn't been any chaos from
the abandonment of NRA for three
! very good reasons. We are in a tide
of improving business and that
makes it a lot easier to avoid con
j flicts of interest than in bad times.
Then there has been a gradual ac
i cumulation of needs for production.
! We have used up things in the de
: pression period."
