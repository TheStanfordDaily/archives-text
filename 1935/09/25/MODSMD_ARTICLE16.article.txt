"But I didn't know I couldn't take
all my 2:3o's in one week!"
"Why does Mrs. Mort make you
sign that lock-out slip when you're
only 10 minutes late?"
"Is a late leave when you don't
leave the movie in time to get home
by 10:30?"
"What is the Committee of Five?"
It is to avoid such questions as
these, asked year after year by our
confused freshmen women, and to
avoid the embarrassing situations
that arise as a result of lack of
understanding of the lockout rules,
that Women's Council has insti
tuted a "course" in freshman reg
ulations this year, given at Roble
with the sponsors as professors.
The "course," which is compul-

I sory, began several days ago with a
careful reading of the Women's
regulations. Under the new rules
freshmen women are allowed:
(a) One week-end 2:30 each
week, (b) Three additional 2:30
leaves during the quarter to be
used only on week-ends, (c) Spe
cial cultural and activity late
leaves. Under these regulations
first-quarter women arc allowed
no mid-week late leaves.
After studying the rules, freshmen
received a list of sample question?
which they were asked to fill out for
practice. Their "course" was culmi
nated by a "final examination," giv
en in corridor meetings, in which
they were quizzed on their knowl
edge of the rules.
