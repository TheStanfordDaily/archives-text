# Manager Quits Student Offices
## Bob Gros Resigns From Ex Committee Post 
### 
"I will have no political axes to
grind," said Bob Gros, student man
ager, when approached yesterday as
to his plans for the coming year.
Gros has announced his resignation
from all the offices which he held, in
cluding the important Ex Commit
tee position, in order to be better
able to handle student body affairs.
"There will be nothing spectacu
lar, nothing new nor revolutionary
about this year's student manager,"
continued Gros. "I am simply inter
ested in running this office on the
most efficient business-like basis
possible and shall devote my efforts
1o that end. Principal emphasis will
be placed upon co-operation and un
derstanding the various problems of
the nearly 200 student organizations
with which this office has contact."
Gros has spent the better part of
the summer corresponding with the
managers and heads of the principal
organizations in an effort tt> better
acquaint himself with their problems
and be prepared to work wifh them
more successfully.
The special election to fill the Ex
Committee seat left vacant by Gros
will be held early next week, ac
cording to members of the election
board.
