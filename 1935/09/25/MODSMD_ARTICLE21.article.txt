# Mine Unions Picket As Strike Continues
## 
### (By the Associated Press 
Scattered picketing, but a com
plete absence of disorder, marked
the second day of the strike of the
United Mine Workers of America
yesterday.
As union chieftains, claiming
their entire membership of 400,000
was solely back of their demands,
offered an "ultimatum," to operator
conferees on a national wage scale
in Washington, strikers began pa
troling a group of "wagon" pits in
southwestern Pennsylvania.
Serve Notices
In Kentucky, where about half the
state's 50,000 diggers were idle again,
union officers served with notices of
a hearing in Frankfort federal court
loday on the plea of the Barker
Straight Creek Coal Company and
the Southern Miners' Union for a
write to prevent picketing of its
mines.
lowa U.M.W.A. heads asserted they
contemplated picketing non-union
mines.
Illinois union members quietly
awaited an order to return to work
and claimed support from members
of their rival organization, the Pro
gressive Miners of America, at two
pits. The U.M.W.A. had issued an
appeal for progressive action "that
we may say the miners of Illinois
are standing 100 per cent with the
rest of the miners of this country."
Situation Not Pressing
With emergency reserves of fuel
estimated at 53 days for industry,
its situation was not pressing.
. But how long the miners could
hold out before turning to relief or
other aid was an unanswered ques
tion.
A few reports of miners returning
to work in the important Pennsyl
vania-West Virginia field were scru
tinized in this connection.
At Washington, the union presi
dent, John L. Lewis, told the opera
tors their final offer was for a nine
cents a ton increase for digging and
loading. The operators had said 7Mi
cents a ton increase was the best
they can do.
