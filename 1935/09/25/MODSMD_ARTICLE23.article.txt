The remorseless negro, fighting
his greatest battle in his short pro- |
fcssional career, smashed the for
mer heavyweight champion's face ]
into a gory mask in the short, but
savage slaughter.
Baer was knocked down twice in
the third round for counts of nine
and four, the last one interrupted by
the bell, and took the final count
after two minutes, 50 seconds of the
fourth round. Baer weighed 210V2
pounds, Louis, who was married
three hours before the fight, 199V4.
Max Outclassed
Baer, although withstanding a
terrific lacing until near the end of
the third round, flashed only a few
moments of his own punching power.
Outclassed, outboxed and outspeed
ed, the Californian launched one
brief spurt midway in the first
round, then was on the receiving
j end for the most part until he let
; go with another two-fisted, furious
I drive near the end of the second
j round.
The former champion, grinning
through the blood that poured from
: his mouth and nose, had one iast
: magnificent gesture. As he sagged
and went down under a deadly at
| tack by Louis in the third round,
, Max looked up and waved to the
! crowd. He got up at nine, only to
go down again in a heap and be
j saved temporarily by the bell, at
I the count of four.
Joe Takes His Time
Louis took his time finishing the
| job in the fourth round. The "brown
bomber" stalked his beaten oppon
ent, pumping lefts to the head and
• digging left hooks to the body that
i made Baer wince. With only 20 sec
onds of the round to go, Baer tot
tered again under a sudden, lashing
attack to the head. He went down
slowly, squatting, then getting to one
knee. Referee Donovan counted
"ten" while Max still was shaking
his head and looking blankly into
the faces of ringsiders.
