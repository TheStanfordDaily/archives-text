WASHINGTON, Sept. 24 (/P).â€”A
definite trend toward business nor
malcy was seen today by Secretary
Perkins in reporting an increase of
180.000 workers on the payrolls of
manufacturing industries in Au
gust compared with July.
Although the increase was some
what offset by an employment de
cline of 25.000 persons in non-manu
facturing industries, Secretary Perk
ins described the net gain as "sub
stantial progress" back to normal.
