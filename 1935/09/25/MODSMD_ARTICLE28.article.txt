GENEV, Sept. 24 (/P).—'The Coun
cil of the League of Nations faced a
grave decision tonight after its sub
committee abandoned efforts to find
a solution for peace in East Africa.
What further steps will be taken
must be decided by the Council. In
view of the tremendous possibilities
involved in one false move at this
juncture, a strong sentiment was no
ticeable among delegates to avoid
precipitous action.
An advance of thousands of Ethi
opian warriors toward the north-

east frontier to guard against a sur
prise attack by Indian foi-ces whs
reported today from Adowa. The
warriors were said to be equipped
with two months' rations.
Military observers in London ex
pressed belief that continued Italian
refusal to accept arbitration propos
als, combined with accelerated mili
tary mobilization in Italy and the ap
proach of the end of the Ethiopian
rainy season, left an outbreak of war
in East Africa within a fortnight or
so almost a foregone conclusion.
