LONDON, Sept. 24 (/P). â€” The
British cabinet, standing squarely
behind its guns, decided today not
to alter its policy of unlimited sup
port of the League of Nations' Cove
nant in the Italo-Ethiopian crisis.
A full dress meeting of minis
ters placed an unqualified stamp of
approval upon everything done at
Geneva recently by British dele
gates.
