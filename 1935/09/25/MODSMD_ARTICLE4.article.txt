# All-Time High Established As 3783 Register
## Total of 4,000 Expected To Enroll by Close Of 14-day Period 
### 
All existent registration records
fell today as 3,783 students enrolled
for the fall quarter, with that-num
ber expected to be increased to 4,000
before the end of the two-week
registration period, it was announced
late yesterday by Dr. John P.
Mitchell, registrar.
This figure exceeds by almost 200
the total of 3,618 recorded at a com
parable time last year. One hun
dred and eighty-four students reg
istered Registration Day this year
than on Registration Day in 1934, the
records reveal.
The present total of 3,783 includes
3,674 students who stood in lines
winding completely across the Ad
Building during the two days of
registration here, and 109 students
who have already signed up at the
Lane Medical School in San Fran
cisco.
Two new women's dorms estab
lished during the summer will care
for the slight increase in the num
ber of women on the campus to
date. There were 1,056 of them last
night as compared to 1,028 on a com
parable day last October. The famed
"500" passes further into history, and
leaves the ratio of men to women at
approximately 2.6 to 1.
