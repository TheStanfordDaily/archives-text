EVERYTHING TOO QUIET
iO SUIT SCRIBES
Everything is going almost too well
with Stanford's gridiron outfit this
year. At least everything is set just
a little too perfectly to suit the gang
Cards' practice fields. every after
noon.
Of course Tiny, and the players,
and their Farm following, and the
newspapermen too, like to see things
riding well but on the other hand
they've got to earn a living writing
news and about all the news that
can be garnered about Stanford is
characterized by Tiny Thornhill's
frequent expression—"everything is
going fine."
Here's a sample of their troubles.
Team line-ups, usually issued just
before game time, are ordinarily
considered news. But look at the sit
uation as far as Stanford's line-up
for Saturday is concerned.
'Way back in the middle of last
week Tiny had his first string all cut
out and right then the scribes knew
that any story about the game line
up was on the skids.
Of course there is always a chance
that one of those first eleven might
be injured in practice, or contract
ilu, or get the measles. But that
would be news anyway.
Yesterday, Tiny officially an
nounced his line-up for Saturday's
San Jose game. And naturally it
was just the same line-up, in fact
the only line-up, that has been used
since football began this fall. The
sports men won't be able to make
any big headlines out of that point.
It's the same way in just about
every case, too. Thornhill spends a
lot of his time fighting off newspa
permen with their ever-present
pleas of "how about a new angle,
Tiny?"
RESERVE TACKLES
BATTLE FOR LEAD
There is an angle, not necessarily
too new or too newsy, that Husky
Hunt, one of Thornhill's assistant
coaches, mentioned the other day,
however.
Husky was wondering why some
one didn't remind the public of the
part that reserve tackles "Pop"
Grant, Harry Carlson, Bob Black,
and Bob Mangan are playing as cogs
in the Indian team this year.
Every one of those fellows is
practically unknown now. But if
anything should happen to the first
string tackles (and we're hoping
nothing does) any one of the four
might overnight be in the spotlight.
They realize that fact, too. Right
now a sort of a four-way duel for
the first spot is being staged and al
though Grant and Black seem to
be on top now, Carlson and Man
gan have ideas about who will get
the chance if the chance should ever
come. —Frost.

EVERYTHING TOO QUIET
iO SUIT SCRIBES
Everything is going almost too well
with Stanford's gridiron outfit this
year. At least everything is set just
a little too perfectly to suit the gang
Cards' practice fields. every after
noon.
Of course Tiny, and the players,
and their Farm following, and the
newspapermen too, like to see things
riding well but on the other hand
they've got to earn a living writing
news and about all the news that
can be garnered about Stanford is
characterized by Tiny Thornhill's
frequent expression—"everything is
going fine."
Here's a sample of their troubles.
Team line-ups, usually issued just
before game time, are ordinarily
considered news. But look at the sit
uation as far as Stanford's line-up
for Saturday is concerned.
'Way back in the middle of last
week Tiny had his first string all cut
out and right then the scribes knew
that any story about the game line
up was on the skids.
Of course there is always a chance
that one of those first eleven might
be injured in practice, or contract
ilu, or get the measles. But that
would be news anyway.
Yesterday, Tiny officially an
nounced his line-up for Saturday's
San Jose game. And naturally it
was just the same line-up, in fact
the only line-up, that has been used
since football began this fall. The
sports men won't be able to make
any big headlines out of that point.
It's the same way in just about
every case, too. Thornhill spends a
lot of his time fighting off newspa
permen with their ever-present
pleas of "how about a new angle,
Tiny?"
RESERVE TACKLES
BATTLE FOR LEAD
There is an angle, not necessarily
too new or too newsy, that Husky
Hunt, one of Thornhill's assistant
coaches, mentioned the other day,
however.
Husky was wondering why some
one didn't remind the public of the
part that reserve tackles "Pop"
Grant, Harry Carlson, Bob Black,
and Bob Mangan are playing as cogs
in the Indian team this year.
Every one of those fellows is
practically unknown now. But if
anything should happen to the first
string tackles (and we're hoping
nothing does) any one of the four
might overnight be in the spotlight.
They realize that fact, too. Right
now a sort of a four-way duel for
the first spot is being staged and al
though Grant and Black seem to
be on top now, Carlson and Man
gan have ideas about who will get
the chance if the chance should ever
come. —Frost.
