# Bullis to Take Moore's Place
## 
### 
With the announcement late yes
terday that John Moore would not
take the position of head soccer
coach for the '35 season, Dick Bullis,
a junior student of the University,
was appointed by B.A.C. officials to
assume the duties of guiding the
varsity and freshmen through the
full season.
Bullis, who learned his soccer in
prep school, is a fullback and played
on the '37 l'rosh team and on last
year's varsity. Late last season he
sustained an injured knee which will
keep him out of competition this
year.
The new coach today announced
that over 30 men have signed up for
the varsity, but that the frosh were
slow in coming around.
All soccermen are required to take
a physical examination in the B.A.C.
at 4 o'clock this afternoon. Equip
ment will be issued from 2 until 4
o'clock tomorrow, and the first prac
tice will be called at 4:15 o'clock.
For the first few weeks daily work
outs will be held.
