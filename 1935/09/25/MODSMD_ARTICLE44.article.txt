# Add Kicking to Backs' Talent
## Indians Exhibit Unproven Ability In Punt Session Bones Hamilton, Grayson Surprise Spectators At Grid Practice 
### 
First it was passing that was go
ing to rejuvenate the Cards in their
'35 championship d.ish. Now it's
kicking.
And kicking a plenty, too. Flank
Alustiza, called a wizard with the
toe-on-pigskin last year was only
one of three, or rather four, yester
day in practice. Frank was lofting
them out almost as well as he ever
did, reaching 50 and 60 yards easily.
But alternating with the Basque
were the other three members of the
backfield, who pleased the gallery
immensely with better and better
boots.
The biggest surprise was Bones
Hamilton. Always a blocker and
ball carrier, he added another
threat yesterday by showing Ernie
Nevers that he could kick the ball
just about as well as anybody else
in the backfield.
Even Bobby Grayson spiraled
some nice ones out at least 50 yards.
The boomer's place, 10 yards back
of the scrimmage line, is a good place
for* the team's kicker so his boots
were not unwelcome to Ernie and
the rest.
Sophomore Bill Paulman, though,
looked like the goods for Num
ber One kicking boy. He not only
gets the longest boots the most
times, but nothing short of a
freight train coining at him seems
to mar his poise and deliberate
calm in getting off his kicks. And
when they are up in the blue they
seem to hang there over long, so
that when the safety man grabs
the ball half the line is around
him like a mulberry bush.
Besides the punt session Tiny
was working up some plays that
used all manner of rugby passes,
shovel tosses, and laterals. Such ac
tion is right in line with the new
policy of open play and none of last
year's trifling with a team of pass
less wonders.
Paulman's frosh record of passes
completed lets him in for much of
the flnging, and for deadly 10 or 15
yards there is none better. Grayson
and Hamilton are also tossing the
ball around, and there are ends and
halfbacks all over the field leaping
to snag them.
