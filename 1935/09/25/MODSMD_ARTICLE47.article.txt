# Bradshaw Pins Hope on DeWitt
## Papoose Team Weak In Pass Department 
### 
Freshman Coach Rabbit Bradshaw
smiled broadly and said, "He's plenty
good!" The reason for Bradshaw's
smile and remark was 200-pound
Wallace deWitt, who from his full
back position gave a fine exhibition
| of line smashing which was the only
I shining light in a scrimmage held
; yesterday between the first and sec
ond strings of Stanford's papoose
' squad.
Most of the linemen seemed to
turn in a somewhat listless perform
ance, which may be due to the fact
that their first game against Sacra
mento J.C. October 5 is still a long
way off. Bradshaw seems to think
a good cure for this attitude is more
scrimmage, so that is what will be in
order for his charges the next few
• days.
Lack of skilled passers and a still
imperfect pass defense are two things
which seem to be worrying the pep
pery little mentor as time for the
season's opener draws near.
The defense can be easily im
proved and this along with always
present fundamentals is what Rab
bit will stress in ail spare moments
between now and the first game. To
relieve the other worry he must rely
on a couple of boys who, although
not exactly perfect at the art, show
possibilities of being able to go out
into a game and throw plenty of
well-directed passes.
