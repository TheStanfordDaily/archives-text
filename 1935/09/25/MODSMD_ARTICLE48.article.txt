## 
### BILL HULBERT 
Hopes for another successful frosh
i basketball team were raised consid-
I erably Monday when approximately
30 men, many of whom boast bril-
I liant high school careers on the
j maple court, signed with John Bunn,
: head basketball coach, for the 1935-
| 36 season.
Among the top-notchers that can
be counted on to deliver the goods
this year is Phil Zonne, lanky broth
er of last year's star center.
Fills Pivot Post
Phil is a highly touted player from
Los Angeles High, where he was
named on the all-city teams for two
I years and should be able to fill the
| pivot position very handily. With
| him comes Pete MeArthur from the
| same place who likewise will be in
; there for a berth on the starting five.
| Gunning for the guard positions
i will be Charles Melczer, an all
! Stater from Arizona, and William

| Schuette, an all-Prep star from Lake
! Forest Academy of Chicago. Both
! are rated as good ball players and
j should put up a tough battle for the
\ first string.
Prospects Good
From Bellingham, Washington,
come a couple of bright prospects in
Charles Fisher and Walt Skinner,
! both of whom had fine records in
i Northwest basketball circles, while
I from Syracuse, Kansas, Leland
: Glover comes to the Farm rating as a
5 promising prospect.
With these men to form the nuc
leus, Coach Jimmy Bradshaw can
| look forward to the start of the sea
| son with added confidence that
i again this year, as has been the rule
for the past several years, he will
I have a World beater of a squad.
