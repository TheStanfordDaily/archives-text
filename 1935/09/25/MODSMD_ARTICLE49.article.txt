# Coach Predicts Banner Season For Indian Golf
## Expect Stiff Competition For Varsity Posts 
### 
Summer performances of Stanford
golfers throughout the country seem
to indicate a banner year for those j
who finally climb on the varsity |
team. Competition will be unusually j
stiff for positions on the team and >
Coach Eddie Twiggs seems worried j
about finding enough jobs for all the !
par shooters.
Spec Stewart, Don Edwards, and j
Morse Erskine are among those ,
whose records for the summer, while- I
not ,as stellar as that of Stanford's I
top golfer, Lawson Little, seem to i
indicate an unusually potent golf i
aggregation for the year.
Stewart Is Winner
Stewart won the western junior
championship at Colorado Springs.
Edwards went to the semi-finals in j
the upper division of the western. I
Erskine, after staging a fierce battle, j
dropped the California state cham- i
pionship on the 19th hole to Jack j
Gains.
Among the new transfers is found .
Kim Bannister from Phoenix, who
will give the old timers much to fight
for in the top positions. His first
scores on the Farm course were 71-
72. He was runner-up to Spec Stew
art in the Western Junior and has 1
held the Arizona State Junior cham- 1
pionship.
Freshmen Outstanding
In addition to returning varsity
squad members a powerful freshman
team returns from last spring.
