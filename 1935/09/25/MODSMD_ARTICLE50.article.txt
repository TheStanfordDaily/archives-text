## "Let the Winds of Freedom Blow" Member of the Associated Press New Fraternity Rushing Rules Reveal A More Satisfactory Plan for the Row 
### 
Yesterday's release on the new 1935-30 in
terfraternity rushing rules, approved by Dr.
Wilbur and Dean Culver, reveals a gradual
tendency toward a more practicable set of
regulations under which the Houses up the
Row may work.
This year's rules show a forward step in
the direction of a more satisfactory working
schedule for the Greeks. Gradually the loop
boles which have existed in the past are
plugged. Some of those phrases that the
Greeks might have laughed at previously have
been tersely expressed and in no uncertain
terms.
Greatest boost to a less strained rushing
season is the addition of the statement that
"infractions of the . . . rules must be reported
to the president or secretary of the Interl'rater
nitv Board of Control not later than fifteen
days after such an infraction occurs."
Phrased in an attempt to prevent the catas
trophe which befell the Row in the early part
of 1932 when all pledging of underclassmen
was postponed six months, the rushing com

inittec of the Council lias rightly added the
above-quoted statement to ease oil' any pos
sible mass expose this year.
Evidence of illegal rushing against other
Houses can no longer be saved for a period of
months. Practically immediate notice of in
fractions must be made. The holding oil' of
such evidence against another House to use for
retaliatory purposes when charges are made
against the particular House will not be found
011 so large a scale.
The rushing committee has acted wisely in
adding the corrections and new regulations
which smooth out some of those questionable
and touchy points.
Another commendable feature is the re
quirement that any pledging conducted after
the regular date in January must be confirmed
by the Hoard of Control. This will institute
more regularity in the after-season rushing.
All in all the new rules are aimed at a more
harmonious Row, working as a unit, getting
together to devise a practicable plan that
would tend to lessen anarchy among the
Houses.
