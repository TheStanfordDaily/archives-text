# Right of Investigation Exists Even in the Sporting World
## 
### 
The sports editor of the Daily California!!,
.lack Tracer, made the "mistake" a short lime
ago of dabbling in things that do not concern
himâ€”the conduct ol another school that ad
mittedly abides by Pacific Coast Conference
ridings on matters of the administration of
athletics.
For Ibis "mistake" Mr. Trager has been
hauled upon the carpet by the San Francisco
press and become the butt of taunts of "poor
sportsmanship" on his part for daring to in
vestigate a rumor thai St. Mary's, who claims
that she follows the Conference dictuins in
both spirit and letter, commenced organized
football practice before the legal date set for
Coast teams.
The truth of the accusation was of no con
cern to the metropolitan press. The Daily,
however, recognizes that the "right to investi
gate" is an inalienable one and a proper func
tion of Mr. Trager in his capacity as sports
editor of a major university daily.
Investigation of the athletic conduct of Con
ference members is the only manner in which
evasions of the regulations can be discovered
and dealt with. Every institution that is liv
ing up to the spirit of the laws which it helps
to make will welcome a thorough investiga
tion, and there is no way to bring the non-con
formists into line except by tracking down
those evasions. St. Mary's, although not a
mcmbur of the Facilic Coast Conference, falls
under this law by her own decision to abide by
Conference regulations.
If the San Francisco sports writers are an
xious to make an issue of an investigation into
any institution's athletic conduct, they might
do i( by staging a counter-investigation to es
tablish the truth or falsity of the statements,
instead of making themselves ridiculous by
challenging the right to investigate.
