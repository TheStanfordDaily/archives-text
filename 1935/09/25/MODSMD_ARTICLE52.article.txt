Vox Cam pi, nee Campus Opinion, is open lo
all campus residents this year, ready again to
become the haven of student gripes, peeves,
and novel theories.
In days past, the Daily has found it em
barrassing to try to squeeze all the opinions
sent in during a dog-fight into insufficient

space. This year, contributions which con
tain unnecessary details or that are overlong
will be pared to meet space limits. Those
under 100 words need have little fear of the
editorial pencil.
Contributors must give their names to the
Daily, to affix responsibility, if any. Their
names will be withheld from publication if so
requested; noms-de-plume are acceptable.
So, in these early days on-campus, any irri
tations that come to the student's mind may
be aired in Vox Cam pi, where they may be
read, cussed and discussed, answered, or pos
sibly just ignored.
