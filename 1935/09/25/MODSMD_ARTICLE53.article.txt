"Charging Indian in Daily Nameplate
Sets Keynote for Revision of Policy"
That's not new—the Union Cellar has been charging
the Stanford Indian for years.
In re The Daily's new type yesterday, a little scene
was enacted in the office of Stanford's face-lifted
newspaper. An irate printer came charging into the
sacred precincts of the "city room" waving a paper
in the air. Said he: "You'll have to write this head
over!"
"Whassamatter, doesn't it fit?" replied the cowering
reporter.
"No," answered the beetle-browed automaton,
"We've run out of F's."
Freshmen, if they don't know it already, will soon
find out from the Sunday supplements that there are
many mystic rites, furbelows, grips, and passwords in
fraternity life. As an illustration of the sacredness of
these to the hearts of the "frat" men, may we call at
tention to the two following incidents. One of our high
powered Rally Committeemen was working as a scene
shifter down in Hollywood for a while this summer
and chanced to get on a production starring one of the
boys who used to be affiliated with the same national
in some college back East.
The Rallyman extended a massive paw, presented
his name, with statement as to Stanford Chapter '37.
And then came an awful moment, when he realized he
had forgotten the grip.
The Phi Psi's have a Filipino second-boy, who mani
cures the ramparts and ramifications of that far-flung
house with a broom every day, and has other small
duties in regard to health and sanitation. This particu
lar second-boy has been an institution at the Phi Psi
house since the time 10 years ago when he first got
the job. When one of the brothers was bidding good
bye to the second-boy at the end of spring quarter, the
little brown brother flashed a broad smile, said, "See
you in L A. this summer," and slipped him the official
Phi Psi grip.
