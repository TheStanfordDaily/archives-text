Why doesn't Elinor Glyn return for another look at
flaming youth? She'd find fire in us still, but not the
deep scarlet kind that set the motif of her famous
novel.
Adversity, the same alloy that colors the rings under
paternal eyes has today changed youth's fire into
something perhaps comparable to a "gem-like flame"
—a hard blue fire of ambition, sometimes of fighting
desperation, seldom of easy complaisance.

This summer, for example, many of us young 'uns
who ordinarily sought enforced idleness and a pleasant
dawdling with life once academic stimulant was gone,
approached our vacations with economic chills and
fever.
One found fewer Stanford men canoeing on
mountain lakes or racing from $5 a day hotels into
sleek and classy pools, or clandestinely pro-creating
on papa's yacht. One had to look, instead, to grimy
waterfronts where they were stevedoring, to offices,
to newspaper city rooms where they hum-drummed
on publicity overnight.
You'd perhaps find them also going to bed nights,
at home. And you'd also have found that the froth
and giggle of their co-ed companions' ordinary talk
replaced by verbed and nouned sentences, their flimsy
airs displaced by directed action and talk on life and
Work—and the inevitable consideration of daily bread.

Just how it happened or when it happened—this
revolution in our habits—is as difficult to determine
as the exact value of a train ride. But supporting the
fact that it has happened is the incontrovertible evi
dence of employment statistics.

Many Stanford men, unjustly famed for their ex
pertness at impersonating play-boys, returned to the
campus yesterday or the day before but last week and
last month—to seek jobs.
Between 700 and 800 of them are on the rolls of
Stanford's Student Employment Bureau, the largest
number ever pre-registered, according to Mrs. Irene
Spenner Coverley, manager. They are all looking for
jobs, many of them not because they need the money,
but because they need the self-respect of knowing they
have a place in this man's world.
