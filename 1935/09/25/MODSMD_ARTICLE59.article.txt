Louis was married to a Chicago
stenographer tonight two hours and
five minutes before he was to climb
through the ropes to trade punches
with Max Baer.
While a noisy crowd waited out

through a ceremony that made him
the husband of Marva Trotter of
Chicago. Then, without a change of
j expression he said, "I've got a date
; with a fellow named Max Baer," j
and rode ofT to the scene of the con
flict behind a screaming motorcycle
escort."
