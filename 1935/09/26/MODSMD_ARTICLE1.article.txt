# Roster Jumps Five Percent; 3,812 Enroll
## Rolls Swelled with New Advanced Students; 35 More Women Men's Halls Overflow Few Encina Rooms Left For Upperclassmen 
### 
In line with heavily increased reg
istration in all coast schools, official
figures released by Registrar J. P.
Mitchell last night show Stanford's
enrollment up 5 per cent over last
year. At 5 o'clock yesterday 3,812
students had registered, as compared
to 3,635 the same time in 1934. Of
the 177 additional students 35 are
women.
The increase comes not with the
enrollment of freshmen, according
to Dr. Mitchell, but with upper
classmen and graduate students.
"Stanford's record-breaking reg
istration," said the registrar last
night, "is significant in that it shows
that men who in previous years
were forced to seek employment are
now able to return to the campus
for advanced work."
Following the announcement of a
new all-time record enrollment at
Stanford comes the report that the
men's dormitories ai'e completely
filled, with the exception of a few
Encina vacancies.
These vacancies are reserved only
for upper classmen, either new or
old to the campus, according to the
Dean of Men's office.
