and preserver of Farm person and
property. 1
The mere sounding of an alarm on |
any part of the campus will bring I

all the fire-fighting equipment at
their command. The alarm is regis

For instance, two blasts, an interval,
and three blasts indicates that fire
has broken out in Encina Hall. Each
locale has its own series of siren
blasts.
These blasts are in turn registered
on a machine that punches holes in
a strip of paper. The firemen need
only glance at this contraption to
find where they are going, and per
haps why.
