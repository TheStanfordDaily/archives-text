# Few Stags Noted At Crowded Reg Dance
## 
### 
One of the largest crowds in the
history of many Stanford reg dances
crowded into the women's gym
Tuesday night and executed the in
tricate steps of that old Big Game
night favorite: the Sardine Shuffle
(for Stanford Cards).
Over one-fourth of Stanford's
rolling stock (gathering no moss)
jammed into the gymnasium, ac
cording to statistics released by the
A.S.S.U. office, who placed the num
: her of students at 1,132. Numerically,
thus exceeds the drawing power of
I lecturers in the History of Western
! Civilization and quite a few Dra-
I matic Council productions, also ac
j cording to statistics.
That this was extremely profitable
j to the entrepreneurs, Sigma Delta
Chi, honorary journalism fraternity,
j may be seen by dividing unit cost
into total cost, or something, and the
result shows the remarkable advan
tages of mess production.
Notable about last night's dance to
distinguish it from other crowded
! leg dances was that there were less
| stags dear-hunting last night, re
j suiting in fewer cut-ins and more
j happiness, and the introduction of a
newly organized campus dance or
, chestra, led by Freddie Nagel, and
! featuring the estimable services of
Messrs. Dudley Nix, lately of Coak
ley's band, and Bob Cutter, still of
; Hal Grayson's orchestra.
