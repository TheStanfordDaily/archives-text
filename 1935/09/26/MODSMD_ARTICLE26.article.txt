## Fascist Spokesman Says Coup d'Etat Report Is Unfounded

LONDON, Sept. 25 (A I ).—Official
Italian quarters expressed amaze
ment today at rumors of a possible
overthrow of Premier Mussolini —
rumors which apparently emanated
from London last week-end and now
have spread to Paris and America.
These officials said stories that
Crown Prince Umberto or General
Italo Balbo might seize upon the
present Ethiopian crisis as a chal
lenge to the leadership of II Duce
were "utterly foolish."
The reports originated in a Lon
don Sunday newspaper.
In Rome, an Italian /government
spokesman said the royal house and
the government were in perfect ac
cord on the campaign. He said that
Prince Umberto had, in fact, been
passing tens of thousands of sol
diers in review as they departed
from Naples for East Africa.
Further, said the spokesman,
the crown prince himself had
wanted to go to East Africa.
The official declared that Musso
lini and the prince had not seen
each other for some weeks and
therefore could not have had words
several days ago, as stated in the
rumors he was denying.
