# Return of Larson To Bolster Card Tackle Position
## 210-lb. Center-Tackle Will Aid Beedle in Post Left by Calloway 
### 
The worries of one Claude E.
j Thornhill were given several degrees
of respite yesterday as word was re
ceived that Nels Larson, 210-pound
center-tackle, planned to return to
j school today. The big fellow has
been in and out of school for the
past year, and his return goes a long
way in plugging the team's one
weakness—that of tackle reserve
| material.
Coach Thornhill plans to fit Lar
son in at right tackle, where he
I will start right behind I>ale Beedle,
who still looks best for the spot
vacated by the absent Cab Callo
way. All of which makes the wor
ried-over post twice as strong,
; with two powerful, experienced
men fighting for the call.
Now with Larson returning the
; tackles are no longer a weak link.
Behind Reynolds, Beedle, and Lar
! son there are Bob Mangan, Bob
Dakan, Swede Carlson, and Pop
; Grant, four more competent men.
Aerial Attack Feature'd
Yesterday's session again saw
footballs flying all over the field in a
dummy scrimmage workout. Out of
60 plays, not more than six were
j run, and those only for variety. Bill
Paulman, Johnny Campbell, Bobby
Grayson, Glenn and Bones Hamilton,
Frank Alustiza, and Ray Todd all
took turns in flinging them. The first
two justified all reports with their
j low rifling tosses traveling 30 yards
at the same altitude.
Just how many of these aerial
plays Tiny plans to try out against
San Jose State is a moot question.
It's a cinch that passes are going
to gain many yards in the more
important tussles, though, so Sat-
J urday should see Paulmaji and
: Grayson tossing a few.
Tiny had four teams running
j through the pass drill yesterday and
chances are that he will use most of
them agaiast the Spartans Saturday,
j The week following will see the
Cards up against U.S.F.'s big and
tough Dons at Kezar, and Saturday
is the time to see how the second and
third stringers go under fire.
Muller Holds Center Spot
So far the center situation has
been left out in the cold as far as
publicity goes, with the tackles and
halfbacks grabbing all the write
ups, but the situation remains much
the same, with Wes Muller still get
ting the call over Alf Brandin. Wes
v/as out for a couple of days at the
first of the week, but is O.K. now and
will probably start Saturday.

footballs flying all over the field in a
dummy scrimmage workout. Out of
60 plays, not more than six were
j run, and those only for variety. Bill
Paulman, Johnny Campbell, Bobby
Grayson, Glenn and Bones Hamilton,
Frank Alustiza, and Ray Todd all
took turns in flinging them. The first
two justified all reports with their
j low rifling tosses traveling 30 yards
at the same altitude.
Just how many of these aerial
plays Tiny plans to try out against
San Jose State is a moot question.
It's a cinch that passes are going
to gain many yards in the more
important tussles, though, so Sat-
J urday should see Paulmaji and
: Grayson tossing a few.
Tiny had four teams running
j through the pass drill yesterday and
chances are that he will use most of
them agaiast the Spartans Saturday,
j The week following will see the
Cards up against U.S.F.'s big and
tough Dons at Kezar, and Saturday
is the time to see how the second and
third stringers go under fire.
Muller Holds Center Spot
So far the center situation has
been left out in the cold as far as
publicity goes, with the tackles and
halfbacks grabbing all the write
ups, but the situation remains much
the same, with Wes Muller still get
ting the call over Alf Brandin. Wes
v/as out for a couple of days at the
first of the week, but is O.K. now and
will probably start Saturday.
The worries of one Claude E.
j Thornhill were given several degrees
of respite yesterday as word was re
ceived that Nels Larson, 210-pound
center-tackle, planned to return to
j school today. The big fellow has
been in and out of school for the
past year, and his return goes a long
way in plugging the team's one
weakness—that of tackle reserve
| material.
Coach Thornhill plans to fit Lar
son in at right tackle, where he
I will start right behind I>ale Beedle,
who still looks best for the spot
vacated by the absent Cab Callo
way. All of which makes the wor
ried-over post twice as strong,
; with two powerful, experienced
men fighting for the call.
Now with Larson returning the
; tackles are no longer a weak link.
Behind Reynolds, Beedle, and Lar
! son there are Bob Mangan, Bob
Dakan, Swede Carlson, and Pop
; Grant, four more competent men.
