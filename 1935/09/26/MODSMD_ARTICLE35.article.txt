# NRA Racketeers Endanger Future Of U.S. Industry

### 
WASHINGTON, Sept. 25 (/P).â€”
NRA's future in the new deal scheme
was linked by President Roosevelt
today to industry's ability to restrain
its chiselers.
If business can police itself
voluntarily, he told his press con
ference, and thus maintain fair
trade and employment conditions,
further action by the government
will not be needed. If not, he
warned, the government must in
tervene.
Most industries, Roosevelt added,
are keeping close to the standards
of the defunct codes, while others
are not. First, all facts must be de
termined by a survey, he said, so
as to furnish the basis for decision
on whether new NRA legislation is
needed.
Scarcely a month ago he asked
the interested congressional com
mittees to study the situation and
prepare legislation for the next ses
sion. At that time he said business
reports "indicate a tendency toward
serious impairment of established
| standai ds by a minority."
