NOT TOO STRONG
THIS CARD SCHEDULE
A lot of people have been noticing
one weak point about Stanford foot
ball this year. It's not the team, it's
that doggone schedule.
Don't know whether you've taken
a close look at it yet but here's tell
ing you—it's pretty rotten.
Here is the strongest Stanford var
sity in years, with everything lined
up for an A-number-1 season, but
without a really strong season of
games slated for it.
Of course the team stands a bet
ter chance to emerge unbeaten after
playing a weak schedule but that's
no argument. It might not play any
games at all and be undefeated, too.
Compare Stanford and U.S.C.
schedules—they speak well for
themselves.

WAS MAXIE
REALLY FINISHED
As long as the talk has drifted to
beefs, gripes, and the like, here's

another. This one is in behalf of the
| thousands who saw the Baer-Louis
fight.
j There are a lot of fight fans who
| believe that Maxie put up a swell
j battle and deserves a lot of credit
j for taking four rounds of pounding,
| crushing blows from winner Joe
j Louis.
i There are a lot of other fight fans,
and this one too, who think that Mr.
J Baer quit before he needed to. True,
! he was taking an awful beating but
! when a man goes into the ring to
! fight 15 rounds for a mere $200,000,
! or thereabouts, he's got to expect
' either to take or give a beating.
I Baer took four rounds and then
1 ended on his knees. They say he
j was still conscious when the ten
' count stopped the fight.
If it were just a ham affair that
I might be accepted, but Baer had
; spent the better part of his life in
| side the ropes and it should have
} been a case of getting up to take a
| few more seconds of mauling, a few
| seconds that would soon put him
j out, or not getting up at all.
But of course, that's just one im
j pression. It's pretty hard to tell just
j what did happen in a fight ring 3.000
j miles away and this might be un
| justly accusing Mr. Baer.
One thing is certain. We all salute
this Mr. Joe Louis as just about the
, last word when it comes to boxing.

NOT TOO STRONG
THIS CARD SCHEDULE
A lot of people have been noticing
one weak point about Stanford foot
ball this year. It's not the team, it's
that doggone schedule.
Don't know whether you've taken
a close look at it yet but here's tell
ing you—it's pretty rotten.
Here is the strongest Stanford var
sity in years, with everything lined
up for an A-number-1 season, but
without a really strong season of
games slated for it.
Of course the team stands a bet
ter chance to emerge unbeaten after
playing a weak schedule but that's
no argument. It might not play any
games at all and be undefeated, too.
Compare Stanford and U.S.C.
schedules—they speak well for
themselves.

another. This one is in behalf of the

fight.
j There are a lot of fight fans who

j battle and deserves a lot of credit
j for taking four rounds of pounding,
| crushing blows from winner Joe
j Louis.
i There are a lot of other fight fans,
and this one too, who think that Mr.
J Baer quit before he needed to. True,
! he was taking an awful beating but
! when a man goes into the ring to
! fight 15 rounds for a mere $200,000,
! or thereabouts, he's got to expect
' either to take or give a beating.
I Baer took four rounds and then
1 ended on his knees. They say he
j was still conscious when the ten

If it were just a ham affair that
I might be accepted, but Baer had
