# Frosh Gridders May Lack Strength
## Freshman Team Fails To Shape Up as Expected Papoose Outfit Gets Stiff Scrimmage in Effort To Smooth Plays 
### 
When the little band of onlookers
: trailed off the freshman practice field
I after last night s scrimmage session
there were a lot of varied impres
j bions.
j One of them was expressed by the
I query, "Aren't these frosh taking a
i little too long to get in shape?" And
] that looms as a probability.
In yesterday's first string-second
j string battle the passing attack still
displayed a distinct weakness. While
j VVally deWitt managed to connect
I with some good throws, the south
; paw finger had occasional flares of
j inaccuracy.
! DeWitt's line plunging, however,
i was the high light of the drill. He
j succeeded in finding good holes in
i the second string line and wasted no
I time in hot-footing it through to
the secondary fortifications,
j Smoothness—that necessary ele-
I ment for a successful offense—is still
! lacking in the Pappoose squad de
! spite the fact that they have a good
; two week's practice behind them.
| But Bradshaw expects that his
i charges will be functioning better by
| the time they meet the Sacramento
i Junior College Panthers in the open
| ing game of the season a week from
j Saturday.
j A brief combined chalk and pep
I talk preceded yesterday's session.
The game of football was origi
nated by the Spartans about 500
