### 
NEW YORK, Sept. 25 (JP).—'The
chocolate soldier, a one-man army
named Joseph Louis, is heading for
the fighting fields of South America
and Europe to show folks abroad,
as he showed Max Baer and 90,000
in the Yankee Stadium, just how
much devastation can be packed in
the fists of one super-warrior.
The battling bridegroom, who
married Marva Trotter three hours
before he knocked out Baer in four
rounds last night, wants to travel,
wants a pleasant honeymoon, but
also wants to fight every two weeks
so long as he's in the business.
So Mike Jacobs, his personal pro
moter, worked out a solution of most
of these problems today as Baer,
licking his grievous wounds in a
hotel suite, insisted that he couldn't
have gotten up cnce more last night,
and vowed that he didn't know why
he failed to carry a slugging fight to
the Detroit Negro as he had prom
ised Jack Dempsey and all the rest
of his friends.
