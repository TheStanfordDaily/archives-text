# "Let the Winds of Freedom Blow"
## Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily Member of the Associated Press Rough Recalls Results of College Peace Poll as War Clouds Darken 
### 
With each passing day bringing little en- i
couraging news from Europe or Africa for a
peaceful dying out of the threatening world
conllict to arise possibly from the impending
Italo-Ethiopian war, the Stanford Rough with
fellow students in one hundred and sixteen
other universities of the country casts aside
his usual carefree, blase front.
Life on the Farm is too peaceful and too
nice to leave for a light with some foreigners
in some oilier pari of the world, he begins to |
discover. He remembers that college editors'
peace poll taken last spring to draw from him
his views Oil war and peace. He remembers j
how he so casually added his emphatic say 1
jn the 2-to-l vote discounting any possibility
of the United States' being drawn into a war.
He smiles when he thinks of that 5-to-l
sentiment expressed in the balloting against
waging a war on foreign territory. Press 110- j

tices from the Halo-Ethiopian front, however,
turn that smile into a shudder. How was he,
one out of one hundred and thirty million
Americans, going to help prevent such a de
velopment?*
The nhe recalls some of the facts revealed
in the poll. He finds consolation in the thought
that he wasn't the only one who voted last
spring. Twelve hundred and seventy-three
ballots are noted in the count for Stanford.
Furthermore, one hundred and fifteen other
colleges are represented in the poll results.
The Hough then sits hack and philosophi
cally considers that the Stanford campus was
not Ihe only college that voted definitely
against lighting the possible war that looms
in other parts of the globe.
No. Life on the Farm, he decides, is 100 com
fortable to give up for some Ethiopian wilds,
African deserts, or European plains. His vole
of last spring makes this fact obvious.
