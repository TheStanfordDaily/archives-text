# Beneath the Arches
## 
### 
As Stanford's largest registration trooped
to elasses yesterday, few oldsters had let the
summer dim the memory of Quad customs,
but newcomers might he open to a few point
ers on how to act beneath the arches.
In deference to the wishes of Mrs. Stanford,
smoking on the Quad, either in classrooms or
on the walks, day or night, is entirely taboo.
To be frank, this custom also cuts down the
insurance rales on the wooden buildings com
prising the Quad. He that as it may, the cus
tom is indexible, and much appreciated by
non-smoking students.
Frosh and women have freedom to walk
where they will on Quad, save on the Law
Steps. These are at all times reserved for
budding lawyers and upperelassmen who hap
pen to be in the vicinity. The sacred steps
may be identified as the second group toward
the post-odice from the English Corner.
Conforming with Stanford's democratic
tendencies, simplicity of dress on Quad is the
second main custom. The moleskin of the
frosh, though it h;is sull'ered setbacks, often
remains more appropriate than the llannels

and tweeds of Hollywood. And though the
Hough is getting smoother, the cord is still the
upperelassman's prerogative and joy.
For milady, sport shoes are the thing, not
high heels. Style - setters frown on flashy
clothes, and overdoses of warpaint are not ;
called for, despite Stanford's Indian theme.
Notwithstanding the death of the 500, or '
the near-atrophy of the Hough, Stanford's I
Quad traditions will undoubtedly live on,
while there are still Stanford men and a Stan- j
fohd Daily.
