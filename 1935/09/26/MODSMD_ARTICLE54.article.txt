# Little Wins His Place
## 
### 
.lust two weeks ago \\\ Lawson Little Jr.
won his fourth national amateur golfing
crown and established himself as the only
"double double" in the history of the amateur
game.
Barring Stanford's semi-marred sucess on
the football field in 1934, Little's smashing
triumphs in the British and American cham
pionships stand out as the University's chief
claim to national distinction in the realm of
recent athletic endeavor. As long as Little
and the present crop of all-American football
players are enrolled at Stanford, there will
be no justified claim that the Farm is a "hack
number" in the sporting world.
