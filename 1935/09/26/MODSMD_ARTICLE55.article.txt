## ON THE ROAD OF PROGRESS

Gone the way of all ineffectual experiments . . .
after an existence . . . unjustified . . . unsung . . .
leaving no mourners ... is the former prime require
ment of all freshmen.

Guilty of not serving its purpose, Citizenship was
the victim of a jury which long debated its case. Even
two years ago when the notoriously "pipe" first-year
course was, to all outward appearances, in its prime,
there were suspicions as to its being a misfit in the
lower division curriculum. Those suspicions gi'ew,
became definite opinions in the minds of those in con
trol, and ultimately resulted in Citizenship's complete
undoing.

But where there are no mourners of a thing that is
dead there need be no gravestones and no epitaphs.

The going by the board of Citizenship can be laid
to laudable progress on the paxt of those who shape
the form of the University's program of teaching.
Their action is the most recent demonstration of
willingness to make changes where changes are due.

Now may this column be the source of a proposal
which also might fall in the line of progress. Credit
by examination—the granting of credit in a course to
a student who is able to pass an examination covering
the field of study before the course is taken.
* * * *
Students of exceptional ability, and some exist in
this university, occasionally run into a course which
offers them nothing new. Often it is a requirement
which must be gotten over with before the student
can go on. If such a student could prove by means of
an examination that he has previously learned the
subject matter, he should be given credit and allowed
to proceed ahead.
* # * *
Such a program is not untried and if instituted
would be an emancipation for many from the several
basic required courses which are the bane of those
who are able to step at once into advanced classes
where the direction of learning is really to be found.
