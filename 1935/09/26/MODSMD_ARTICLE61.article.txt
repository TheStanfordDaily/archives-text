THE REG DANCE seems to have
been an overwhelming success, over
650 bids having been sold. Freddie
NagePs fine orchestra was even bet
ter than the one he had in last
spring's "Follies Bourgeois." And
did you see the line of coats? "This
is nothing at all," said Jimmy Triolo,
swinging an arm in their general
direction. "We've got the overflow
out in the swimming pool with four
men on guard."
IDLE CHAITER: Smart New
York models now use vari-colored
yarn for hair. (The wax kind in
store windows, yokel.) . . . Aimee
Semple McPherson ("The Desert
Walker"—remember?) has written
an opera, of all things! . . . Tommy
Lee turned down a reputed offer of
$2,000,000 from William Randolph
Hearst for the Don Lee network.
Not for sale at any price, said Tom
my . . . Jan Garbcr's first name is
January. And Sax Rohmer's real
name is SMITH!
MOST DANCE LEADERS turn
from jazz to the classics for day-ofl
musical relaxation. Ted Fio-Rito's
favorite is Tschaikowsky's "Pa
thetique" symphony; Jack Shilkret
and Howard Barlow do a brother
act over "Tristan und Isolde"; Andre
Kostelanctz, also a Wagner fan, pre
fers "The Dusk of the Gods" from
"Gctterdummcrung"; Freddie Rich
turns from the lively rhythms of
jazz to Richard Strauss' "Death and
Transfiguration"; Jan Savitt and
Johnny Green like Beethoven's
Fifth Symphony, Raymond Paige,
Brahm's First; while Richard Hini
ber turns from his own smooth
rhythms to those of the "Medita
tion" from "Thais."
AROUND THE DIAL: Frank
Parker sings witih William Daly's
orchestra on KFRC at 4:30 . . . Love
ly-voiced Jane Froman appears with
Paul Whiteman's orchestra on KPO
at 6 . . . Gactano Merola closes his
engagement as director of the Stand
ard Symphony Orchestra with a
program that includes the overture
i to "Phaedra" and the ballet music
from "Prince Igor" on KPO at 8:15.
TIP TO ROBLE: Page Gilman,
; '37, has but one requisite necessary
to all his women, according to an
NBC press release. Blondes, bru
nettes, or redheads—it doesn't mat
ter as long as they have small feet.
