convention session today to meet in
Los Angeles next year as a "demon

government in the United States.
In California the red agitators have

alien leader, witnessed Lhe boldness
of its movements as it assumed con

only broken when martial law was
threatened and 6,000 soldiers were in
the city to protect life and property."
