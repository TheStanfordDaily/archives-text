• You can thank the Duke of Kent for
this smart new style. He made it popular.
It's not an ordinary double breasted at all!
The coat is longer, the lapels are grace
fully curved to the bottom button, the
sleeves and trouser legs are tapered, the
trousers themselves are hill cut and rise
high! You can't help but like the style,
you'll like the soft fabrics and beautiful
patterns, too!
