# Brooke Plans New Deal For A.S.S.U. Jobs
## Ex Committee Schedules First Fall Meeting For Tuesday Round Table Planned Theater Question Heads List for Discussion 
### 
A new deal in A.S.S.U. appoint
ments was outlined yesterday by
President Wally Brooke as the first
move in fall Ex Committee activi
ties. Appointments, says Brooke,
hove been hit-or-miss for too long.
This year oach candidate will
submit a written application,
stating his experience â€” and lie
thinks the official chosen will
probably be more efficient.
Another innovation promised this
quarter is the student leadership
round table. Campus officials will
meet with Professor Edwin Cottrell,
political science head, to discuss stu
dent problems and try to find solu
t ions.
Discuss Theater
Problems tentatively slated to
come up for discussion in Tuesday's
meeting, the first this fall, are head
ed by the new theater arrangements
which occupied so many hours dur
ing Marvie Kahn's regime.
This year's group faccs no dif
ficulty in keeping within the bud
get. Any surplus, and Student
Manager Bob Gros thinks there
will be a sizeable one, will go to
pay theater expenses. "The bud
get drawn for fall quarter was
conservative," explains Gros.
"We'll probably spend even less
than we planned."
Brooke faces a stiff assignment, in
succeeding last year's liberal com
mittee. Among the problems thresh
ed out then were the new theater,
which was finally approved at the
end of spring quarter by the Board
of Trustees.
Daily Wins Dispute
Fifteen cents per student, after
much discussion, was turned back
into the Daily's coffers. Dramatic
Council, which decided to dissolve
itself, was left up in the air for final
solution this term.
Reorganized Concert Scries man
agership and Daily elections were
voted. These changes will be tested
this year. One outstanding accom
plishment. was the furthering of
student-faculty relations, as was the
voting ol a Peace Assembly instead
of the strike advocated by other
colleges.
