NEW YORK, Sept. 26 (A 3 ).--Busy
Mike Jacobs, already in the midst
of planning a European and South
American tour for Joe Louis, halted
long enough today to consider a
proposition that would shift the site
of the proposed Louis-Max Schmel
ing match next June to Detroit,
home town of the chocolate soldier.
Representatives of the Ford Motor
Company, unsuccessful bidders for
Tuesday's duel in which Louis shat
tered Max Baer in four rounds, saw
Jacobs again today with the result
he will leave Sunday night for De
troit for conferences Monday and
Tuesday.
