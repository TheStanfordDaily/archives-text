# ROTC Enrollment Shows Large Gain
## 
### 
In spite of the pacific tendencies
evinced by the Stanford student
body in the peace poll last spring
the R.O.T.C. enrollment for this
quarter shows an appreciable in
crease. Although the official figures
are not yet ready for publication
Lieut.-Col. Bernard R. Peyton, new
commandant of the Stanford Reserve
Officers Training Corp unit, de
scribed the registration as "most
satisfactory," adding that there was
"every indication that it will exceed
that for any previous quarter."
While the war clouds over Ethio
pia may be responsible for this in
creased enrollment Lieut.-Col. Pey
ton stated that it could not be at
tributed to any one factor.
