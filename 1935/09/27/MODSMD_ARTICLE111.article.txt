# Davis Blooms In Red Togs
## 
### 
Gordy Davis' new uniform looks
something like the flowers that
bloom in the spring, tra-la, and it's
all 'cause he's Stanford's own instru
ment of law enforcement.
When the uniform was ready for a
preliminary try-on, Gordy noticed
that the sleeves were trimmed >yith
blue and gold, the official state col
ors, but also the colors of U.C.
"We can't have that," said Gordy.
"I'm from Stanford."
"Okay," said the tailur, "well fix
I it up."
He did. When the uniform was de-
I livered it boasted bright white and
j scarlet trimmings, which make;,
I Gordy a flaming example of Stan
j ford loyalty.
