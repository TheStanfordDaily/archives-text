# "Let the Winds of Freedom Blow"
## Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily Member of the Associated Press Familiar Phrase, Omitted in Assembly, Takes Its Place Among Farm Traditions 
### 
Dr. Kay Lyman Wilbur greeted new stu
dents with a forcible talk in assembly yes
terday morning, but there seemed to be some
thing strangely lacking. The president had
omitted his traditional warning that "gaso
line and alcohol do not mix."
Considering the great increase in the num
ber of cars that the boosted enrollment has
brought to the campus, it was unusual that
Dr. .Wilbur neglected to include his expected
remark. He elaborated on the narcotic ell'ect
of alcohol in general, but some of the return
ing students listened in vain for the familiar
quotation.
At lirst thought there .seem to be but two
explanations for this neglect one is the pos
sibility that Dr. Wilbur is convinced that a
diminished disposition among Stanford stu
dents to over-imbibe counteracts the added
dangers of the greater number of cars; an
other is that the President merely forgot that
line in his speech.
Campus laboratory technicians have been
unable to provide data concerning the former
explanation. However, there is no indication
of a radical change in the pleasure habits of
any large group of students during the slim
mer.
This leaves the original statement that Dr.
Wilbur forgot the gas-and-alky slant. Hut

lhat assumption does not .ring true. He
would not be likely to forget it at the one time
during the year when he deems it appropriate.
However, one other possibility presents it
self. Dr. Wilbur may have believed his point
has been sufliciently pounded home. He may
already have the reaction he desired. He
lias undoubtedly noticed the increasing fear
among students of auto accidents on modern
crowded highways that has prompted more
careful driving and less emphasis on speed.
This eU'ecl he has been striving for, and since
he has the students generally concerned about
the problem, he believes it best to let them
go ahead with their own line of thought
without Administration prompting.
In other words, the constant hammering of
the slogan "gasoline and alcohol do not mix"
h;is begun to take ell'ect, and Dr. Wilbur now
watches it make its way gradually into a Stan
ford tradition, with the eventual outcome that
one of the next few college generations will
take it for granted that when and if they feel
the urge to "hoist a few" they will be riding
in the back-seat, and a competent driver
whose reactions are not dulled will do the
piloting.
No. It does not appear that Dr. Wilbur, who
has a faculty for weighing his words and
phrases carefully, forgot his lines in yester
day's assembly.
