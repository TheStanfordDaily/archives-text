## PICKED UP BY THE VACUUM CLEANER, OR THOUGHTS WHILE STRUGGLING 
### 
On good information, I report that Stanford's much
beloved, bc-labored, and be-publicizcd yell-leader of
last year committed a minor commotion while in the
hospital. He was incarcerated with a gentleman under
observation for acute symptoms.
During the lunch hour, the stooge wheeled in the
lunch. Underneath the sprigs of parsely the gentleman
under discussion found a dish of raspberry jello. Dis
gusted with tho whole business, the tempestuous arm
waver threw the concoction across the room, where it
landed on the floor underneath the feverish proboscis
of the seriously sick (he wasn't fooling) patient.
When the stooge came in to wheel out the lunch,
ho took one look at the quivering jello. another at ihe
feverish proboscis, and ran screaming from the room:
"He's got a hemmorhage!"
Taking one look at the quivering jello, feeling his
feverish proboscis, and hearing the awful commotion,
the long-suffering patient muttered something about
he d he darned if he'd have a hemmorhage for such a
bunch of noisy lugs, and turned over and went to
sleep.
The intimidated freshman who must live under the
reign of terror of Stanford's unresponsive, sponsorious
soonsors and ottentimes teel that their only thought in
life is dishing out hours at the Convalescent Home may
learn from Our Hasher that these martinets can be
human after all.
Last spring during senior week all the noisy Class
of '38 evacuated the enormous barn, leaving the place
all alone to graduating sponsors.
One dark night a large explosion was heard echoing
and re-echoing throughout the corridors. The boys
rushed out to find the cause of the disturbance and
found Eneina's most staid and conservative sponsor
blowing off his store of fireworks. After that, reports
have it (hat many reports echoed and re-echoed
throughout tin corridot. .
