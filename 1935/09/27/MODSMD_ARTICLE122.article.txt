## WE NEED THE "MUSTS" 
### 
Certain men who stand always in sharp focus of
the public eye, who not only earn money but spend
it in a civilized manner, have often scoffed at starry
eyed men in the street who croak, "and what college
did you attend?"
The successful gent may tell them, in grammatical
English, that he didn't attend any, and the men will
hunch their shoulders and withdraw, overcome by the
fact that they had met a polished gentleman who didn't
have the polish applied with an academic spray-gun.
* * * *
That there are such men is, obviously, more a
tribute to their own efforts than to the sources of their
knowledge. But at an early point in our college ca
reers, many of us have suddenly realized ihat much of
what is so laboriously pumped into us is available for
much less than $115 at the nearest second-hand book
store.
And simultaneously, we have stumbled on an eval
uation of our own weakness, into the shaking knowl
edge that unless we're forced to look at a book and
learn what's in it, we would simply throw over the
whole business of culture.
* * * *
Students who have attended college for a year or
so, all the while loudly professing their love of clois
tered study, during a sabbatical year in the outside
world have spent their time messing with odd jobs,
seeing the movies, reading terror tales, but not once
doing a culturally worth-while thing.
All of which may have some bearing on the de
mand that we "read two chapters tonight," "memorize
this paragraph tomorrow," "know what's in this next
Friday. . . ."
. . . And which may also have something to do with
those apocalyptic symbols known as grades, and with
the inexcusable examinations which sire them.
* * * *
Discounting the social polish and humanistic de
velopment that college life gives us, most everything
in lectures interpreting, supplementing, or explaining
texts could be learned most anywhere by most Stan
fordites at a probable cost of less than $.100.
The fact that we wouldn't educate ourselves even
if we had $500 is certainly sufficient justification for
the whole grinding machinery of academia.
And it is also sufficient justification for a little mcr
cilessness for the "under-the-wire" boys who want
grades changed, and who soulfully moan, "Gee, Sir,
give me a break. My folks will kick me out of the
house if I flunk your course."
