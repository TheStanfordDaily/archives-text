FOUIt STANFORD STARS enter
tain tonight at Hotel St. Francis in
S.F. Jack Walton, hit of the "Follies
Bourgeois," promises to sing. Ernie
Heckscher will play his well-known
I banjo, Wally Baird will play the St.
Francis' well-known piano, and Gil
Gist, Jr., will give some of his well
known chalk talks. Now I ought to
finish up with a well-known pun ori
''well-known," but to tell the truth,
I just can't think of one.
lIIS ERROR: During a rehearsal
of the production of "Berkeley
Square" here several years ago, the
cast ran through a scene to check
cues. The curtain cue was the line
where the heroine says to the hero,
"This is the strangest kiss since the
world began." She said it, and noth
ing happened. "Curtain," yelled Di
rector Harold Helvenston. "That
I was lousy. Pick up your cue on that.
; Now let's run it through again." So
run it through they did. Again the
lad on the curtain missed his cue.
"Blankety-blankety-blank," yelled
Helvenston. "Why don't you lower

the curtain?"
"I haven't heard the cue," wailed
the curtain man, piteously.
"They said it twice," shouted
Helvy. "'This is the strangest kiss
since the world began'."
"Oh," exclaimed the curtain man.
"I thought she said, 'Let's kiss and
the world be damned!'"
ASTAIRE ROGERS fans who
think their dancing is art should see
Vicente Escudero, famed concert
dancer, and his partner, Carmita,
who will stamp and flirt their way
across the stage of San Francisco's
Community Playhouse Monday eve
ning. Escudero is the fiery, intense,
and sometimes animal-like Spanish
gypsy who is famous for his infinite
rhythmic variations with heels, fin
gers, and even tongue. This, mes
dames and messieurs, will be danc
ing!
FAIR ENOUGH: A certain vaude
ville actor, Solly Violinsky by name,
recently received an offer for an en
gagement in Germany. Salary was
quoted at $1250 a week and funeral
expenses.

of the production of "Berkeley
Square" here several years ago, the
cast ran through a scene to check
cues. The curtain cue was the line
where the heroine says to the hero,
"This is the strangest kiss since the
world began." She said it, and noth
ing happened. "Curtain," yelled Di
rector Harold Helvenston. "That
I was lousy. Pick up your cue on that.
; Now let's run it through again." So
run it through they did. Again the
lad on the curtain missed his cue.
"Blankety-blankety-blank," yelled
Helvenston. "Why don't you lower

the curtain?"
"I haven't heard the cue," wailed
the curtain man, piteously.
"They said it twice," shouted
Helvy. "'This is the strangest kiss
since the world began'."
"Oh," exclaimed the curtain man.
"I thought she said, 'Let's kiss and
the world be damned!'"
