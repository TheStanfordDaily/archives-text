DIAMOND JIM"
At the Stanford Theater
A After being wasted in a
number of inferior pictures,
Edward Arnold finally
reaches the screen in a role
that displays him at his finest. As
rotund, bejeWeled James Buchanan
Brady, sensation of the late 19th cen
tury, Arnold turns in a splendid
piece of character acting.
Though "Diamond Jim" is pri
marily the biography of a person, it
forgets not the startling age of which
Brady was the center. Diamond
Jim's rise to fabulous fortune is par
alleled by the history of the rail
roads from which he became so rich.
Although the story wanders far
from the facts of Brady's life, the fine
acting and Edward Sutherland's able
direction make the film effective
none the less, and Jean Arthur is
worth remembering as "the girl in
his life."
"GOOSE AND THE GANDER"
Also at the Stanford
B Unlike his recent part in
"Special Agent," George
Brent has little to do but
grin in this Irish-stew story
of tangled wives and jewel thieves.
But with the help of Genevieve
Tobin—who adds a zesty tang to the
play—he manages to do it pleasantly
enough.
A docade or .so too old to be con
tinually teamed with Brent, Kay
Francis rounds up the cast at her
mountain "lodge" in true "When
-ladies-meet fashion." After sar
donic smiles from everyone con
cerned, the goose (the wife) is fi
nally back with the gander (the
husband) and the audience feels

! adequately amused with light,
breezy entertainment.
—Botsford
"LIFE BEGINS AT MINSKYS"
At the Columbia, S.F.
BHigh class burlesque, vul
gar revue—that's "Life Be
gins at Minsky's."
There's a lot of the usual
mediocre revue material, some skits
that are dirty, some that are funny,
and a lot that are both dirty and
: funny.
, As just good entertainment, there's
an eccentric dance team, Jerry and
Turk, composed of a tall, ianky,
dead-pan boy and a grinning little
hoyden; a fellow named Val Wil
j liams who does an excellent dance
interpretation of the feelings of a
I dope snifter; and an ensemble dance
I that is really artistic, despite its ab
| normal theme.
Yes, the show is true burlesque,
I but very much above average bur
: lesque. The same old routine is
there, including the dead-pan come
dians and 'the two or three strip
! acts, but with a group of really good
; principals and a fairly good-looking
j chorus.
But don't take the women.

Brady, sensation of the late 19th cen
tury, Arnold turns in a splendid
piece of character acting.
Though "Diamond Jim" is pri
marily the biography of a person, it
forgets not the startling age of which
Brady was the center. Diamond
Jim's rise to fabulous fortune is par
alleled by the history of the rail
roads from which he became so rich.
Although the story wanders far
from the facts of Brady's life, the fine
acting and Edward Sutherland's able
direction make the film effective
none the less, and Jean Arthur is
worth remembering as "the girl in
his life."
"GOOSE AND THE GANDER"
Also at the Stanford
B Unlike his recent part in
"Special Agent," George
Brent has little to do but
grin in this Irish-stew story
of tangled wives and jewel thieves.
But with the help of Genevieve
Tobin—who adds a zesty tang to the
play—he manages to do it pleasantly
enough.
A docade or .so too old to be con
tinually teamed with Brent, Kay
Francis rounds up the cast at her
mountain "lodge" in true "When
-ladies-meet fashion." After sar
donic smiles from everyone con
cerned, the goose (the wife) is fi
nally back with the gander (the
husband) and the audience feels

! adequately amused with light,
breezy entertainment.

BHigh class burlesque, vul
gar revue—that's "Life Be

There's a lot of the usual
mediocre revue material, some skits
that are dirty, some that are funny,
and a lot that are both dirty and
: funny.
, As just good entertainment, there's
an eccentric dance team, Jerry and
Turk, composed of a tall, ianky,
dead-pan boy and a grinning little
hoyden; a fellow named Val Wil
j liams who does an excellent dance
interpretation of the feelings of a
I dope snifter; and an ensemble dance
I that is really artistic, despite its ab

Yes, the show is true burlesque,
I but very much above average bur
: lesque. The same old routine is
there, including the dead-pan come
dians and 'the two or three strip
! acts, but with a group of really good
; principals and a fairly good-looking
j chorus.
But don't take the women.
