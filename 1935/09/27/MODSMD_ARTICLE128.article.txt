# LIGHTS OUT
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
At the intersection of University
Avenue and the cut-off which leads
past the Encina Gym, .an accident
was avoided (in the dark) of last
night by some . . . good brakes.
As that intersection is one of the
more important ones the light which
usually illuminates it . . . should
be replaced at once.
