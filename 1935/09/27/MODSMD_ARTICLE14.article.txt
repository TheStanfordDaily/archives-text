# Air Gives Campus Water Cloudy Look
## 
### BOB EISENBACH 
The gold - fish bowl quality of
Stanford's water isn't due to scour
ing soap dumped into mains by the
janitors, or to the face powder
that a Roble maid indiscriminately
dumped down the sink.
Comptroller Almon E. Roth says
it's air, just plain air, that gives
our aqua pura its milk of magne
sia look. Furthermore the taste is
the result of medical precautions,
and not what you may or may not
have thought.
It seems that buildings located
west of the post office have since
time immemorial been served by a
two-inch main, which became so
overtaxed this year that third-floor
boarder-outers couldn't get even an
ordinary drink.
Air in New Main
A new eight-inch main was com
pleted this summer, and the air re
maining in it when workmen fin
ished has collected in the dead ends
of the line and dissolved in the wa
ter, Mr. Roth revealed. As soon as
all the air finds its way out, the
water will run clear, he said. The

I new line is one of the first installa
tions on the Pacific Coast of Transite
i Pipe, made of a cement - asbestos
compound that is not electrically
active.
As for the taste, it's directly due
to a chlorinating process applied by
the University's portable chlorina
tor. Stanford's water is drawn from
deep wells on the campus, and tem
porarily requires germicidal treat
; ment to make it safe for consump
tion, Mr. Roth declared.
Water Being Checked
En route from the East is a latest
model permanent chlorinator, which
will process water without leaving,
any taste, he said.
Meanwhile, a constant check is
j kept on germ count by a corps of
University bacteriologists, including
Dr. Walter H. Brown, director of the
University health service and presi
dent-elect of the U.S. Public Health
Association, and Dr. Paul Jay Beard,
assistant professor of sanitary sci
ences, under the direction of Al
fred L. Trowbridge, assistant comp
| troller, Mr. Roth revealed.
