# Need $35,000 To Begin Work On Playhouse
## Requirements of Class A Edifice Must Be Met, Says Comptroller Roth; University Gives Up Plan to Erect Class C Structure 
### 
A loan of $35 : 000 in addition to $325,000 originally borrowed under
authorization of the University Board of Trustees must be obtained be
fore construction can start on Stanford's memorial theater, it was revealed
today by Alinon E. Roth, comptroller.

The amount will be needed to
erect the building in conformance
with Class A requirement. Orig
inal plans for a Class C structure
of almost half the seating capacity
have been completely abandoned,
he said.
The revised total estimate is now
$583,701, and with available funds
estimated at $225,371, a total of $358,-
330 will be required for financing,
Roth declared.
Seating Increased
The new drawings show a steel
framed reinforced-concrete, fire
proof structure with a main audi
torium seating 1,700, instead of the
originally proposed 1,000, and a Little
Theater opening onto the single
large stage block. Back of the stage
will be space for dressing rooms, and
to the sides space for classrooms, a
green room, and a scenery dock and
carpenter shop.
The $1 student assessment,
charged in the registration fee to
help pay construction costs, has
lead to complaint from some stu
dents, who are impatient because
work has not already started, Roth
said.
"Regardless of such protest, con
struction will not start until plans
have been satisfactorily worked out
to the smallest details," he declared.
"The theater must serve a number
of groups, and all who may use it
must be fully considered before any
thing is done.
$55,000 Increase
The net increase in the cost of the
building, including additional ap
propriation for increased size and
incidentals, is approximately $55,000,
he said.
Present plans show the theater
placed on the empty block bounded
by Lasuen Street, Serra Street, Gal
vez Street, and Pine Avenue, on the
site of the men's gym destroyed by
the 1906 earthquake.
A new road connecting Lasuen
and Galvez Streets will be cut
through the block back of the build
ing. A large parking area for both
students and visitors coming from
the direction of Palo Alto is avail
able in the open area at the back and
sides of the building, Roth pointed
out..
When completed the new theater
will be the most modern structure
of its kind in the world. Both the
main and auxiliary auditorium's are
adaptable to class meetings as well
as dramatic performances, the plans
show. Special drapes cutting off the
balcony of the main house are used
to decrease the auditorium size for
class meetings.

When completed the new theater
will be the most modern structure
of its kind in the world. Both the
main and auxiliary auditorium's are
adaptable to class meetings as well
as dramatic performances, the plans
show. Special drapes cutting off the
balcony of the main house are used
to decrease the auditorium size for
class meetings.
A loan of $35 : 000 in addition to $325,000 originally borrowed under
authorization of the University Board of Trustees must be obtained be
fore construction can start on Stanford's memorial theater, it was revealed
today by Alinon E. Roth, comptroller.

The amount will be needed to
erect the building in conformance
with Class A requirement. Orig
inal plans for a Class C structure
of almost half the seating capacity
have been completely abandoned,
he said.
The revised total estimate is now
$583,701, and with available funds
estimated at $225,371, a total of $358,-
330 will be required for financing,
Roth declared.
Seating Increased
The new drawings show a steel
framed reinforced-concrete, fire
proof structure with a main audi
torium seating 1,700, instead of the
originally proposed 1,000, and a Little
Theater opening onto the single
large stage block. Back of the stage
will be space for dressing rooms, and
to the sides space for classrooms, a
green room, and a scenery dock and
carpenter shop.
The $1 student assessment,
charged in the registration fee to
help pay construction costs, has
lead to complaint from some stu
dents, who are impatient because
work has not already started, Roth
said.
"Regardless of such protest, con
struction will not start until plans
have been satisfactorily worked out
to the smallest details," he declared.
"The theater must serve a number
of groups, and all who may use it
must be fully considered before any
thing is done.
$55,000 Increase
The net increase in the cost of the
building, including additional ap
propriation for increased size and
incidentals, is approximately $55,000,
he said.
Present plans show the theater
placed on the empty block bounded
by Lasuen Street, Serra Street, Gal
vez Street, and Pine Avenue, on the
site of the men's gym destroyed by
the 1906 earthquake.
A new road connecting Lasuen
and Galvez Streets will be cut
through the block back of the build
ing. A large parking area for both
students and visitors coming from
the direction of Palo Alto is avail
able in the open area at the back and
sides of the building, Roth pointed
out..
