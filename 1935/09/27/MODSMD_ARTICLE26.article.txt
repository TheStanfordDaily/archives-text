# Election Called To Fill Vacant Student Offices
## Gros' Resignations Leave Two Positions Open 
### 
A special election will be held
within the next few weeks in
order to fill several vacancies which
have cropped up over the summer
vacation in A.S.S.U. offices.
Most important of the offices to be
filled is the position of graduate man
on the Ex Committee. This office has
been left vacant by the recent resig
nation of Student Manager Bob Gros,
who was elected to the position last
spring preceding his appointment to
the managership.
At the same election there will be
chosen one upper division man to
serve out the short term on Men's
Council which was also left open by
Gros' resigning from that body. He
will serve from the time of his elec
tion until the regular student body
election in February.
The two other offices to be filled in
the special election are positions on
the Women's Council. One is a short
term office of Mercedes Bergman,
who resigned upon being elected
president of Women's Conference
last June. The second is the full
term office formerly held by Dorothy
Lyman who did not return to school
this September.
Nomination blanks for these of
fices may be obtained from the
A.S.S.U. office in the Old Union or at
the Law Steps during days nomina
tions are being received. Tuesday
and Wednesday have been set as the
days for receiving nominations.
These may be turned in at the Law
Steps any time between 8 o'clock and
6 o'clock, October 1 or 2.
The date of the election has been
tentatively set for October 8, but it
may have to be set over until bawl
outs are available with which to
check the voters.
