# Topping Lost To Cards For Spartan Game
## Cracked Rib Puts Star End On Sidelines for Week; Trompas Also Out Chet Olcott To Play Spartan Eleven To Test Indian Pass Defense 
### 
Tiny Thornhill will send his Big
Red Maehine on the field against
San Jose State tomorrow for the sea
son's curtain raiser minus Keith
Topping, who will be out for at least
a week and perhaps two with a
cracked rib.
The big right end felt the rib go
during a bit of. by-play yesterday
before practice, and an examination
showed it to be of a serious enough
nature to put him out of commission
for tomorrow's game and perhaps the
U.S.F. game a week hence.
Oicott To Play
Just who was to take his place
was not determined last night, but
chances are that Chet Olcott, a
heavily built transfer who looked
good in .spring practice, will get the
nod. The situation is made doubly
serious by the fact that little Alex
Trompas, Topping's sub, is also out,
having been in stx-eet clothes all
week. Carl Schott, Roger Munger,
Jack Clark, and Grant Stone may
also get a look-in at a flank position.
Tomorrow's show will probably
turn out to be a case of the varsity
taking the field for the opening
kick-off until they get the old feel
of competitive strain, then a constant
stream of substitutes filtering in for
the coach's observation.
Spartans To Pass
Dud DeGroot's Spartans have lost
many of last year's squad, and are
not figured to lend too much opposi
tion to the Card try-out session. A
strong probability is, however, that
they will try to go places on passes
â€”which means that one of Stanford's
not-too-strong departments, pass
defense, will get a thorough once
over tomorrow.
Tomorrow will also see how the
two neophytes, Dale Beedle and Bill
Paulman, can step along in the big
leagues. There seems to be no rea
son why the pair can't move right
along with the rest of the machine,
for Beedle is known for the way he
fights in a game, and Paulman for
the cool way he goes about his as
signments.
Point Toward Dons
Although Thornhill will take no
chances on losing the game under
any circumstances, he will use the
encounter chiefly to warm up his
men for the stiff tussle that waits
them next week when they go up
against the U.S.F. Dons. He isn't
forgetting the awful time he had Jast
year up in Kezar when the game was
almost lost, and would have been
except for a timely Moscrip field
goal.
Student admission will be free
with student body cards, and the
regular admission 50 cents. The game
will start at 2:30, with no preliminary
scheduled.
