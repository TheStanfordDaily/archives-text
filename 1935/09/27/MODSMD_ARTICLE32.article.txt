# Italy Warned Not to Battle Before Dec .4
## Air Patrol Suggested For Protection of Ethiopia From Invasion 
### 
GENEVA, Sept. 26 (/P) — The
council of the League of Nations
solemnly warned Italy and Ethiopia
today against war.
. At the same time it constituted it
self into a committee to draft a re
port with recommendations for set
tlement of the East African conflict
and to consider, meanwhile, if "any
thing further can be done to safe
guard peace."
Should either nation start hostili
ties before December 4, the league
warned, it will be considered to
have committed an act of war against
all league members. This would
automatically call for punitive steps.
Air Patrol Suggested
One suggestion for a further safe
guard for peace was made in in
formal discussion in league lobbies.
11: was to send a league air patrol
to Ltliiopia which could act as "the
eyes of the covenant" along the
frontier of the African kingdom.
League observers from the sky,
it was asserted, could report ac
curately and instantly if hostili
ties began on the border and
could give the council vital assist
ance in the task of determining
the aggressor.
In Rome the league's proposal for
a three months' truce between Italy
and Ethiopia got a cool reception
and "ii cedom of action" was the offi
cial watchword.
The Briiish navy, whose presence
in the Mediteranean is the cause of
gra\ e anxiety hei-e, failed to modify
11 Duce's intentions in East Africa.
Italian officials said, "Italy will
listen to what the League of Nations
may say, but without promising to
wait until after the boggy paths to
Addis Ababa becomes dry enough
to support its army."
Mussolini Will Answer
Since Premier Mussolini may an
swer the league's proposal in his
own graphic words after a cabinet
meeting Saturday, officials avoided
any too emphatic rejection of the
truce idea.
While these things were happen
ing, a Reuters (British) News
Agency dispatch to London from
Crete, Greece, said an Italian war
hip took soundings off the north
west coast of the island yesterday
and then departed.
Another Reuters dispatch from
Atlu ns said today five British sub
marines arrived at Astako, Gulf of
Patras, Greece.
Italians Don't Vote
By unanimous vote, the league
council today decided to proceed in
the Italo-Ethiopian dispute under
Article XV of the covenant. With
the Italian delegates refraining
from voting, the council ruled this
article was in operation as from
September 4.
Article XV of the covenant pro
vides the council shall endeavor to
settle disputes and, if unsuccessful,
make a report. Article XVI warns
that if a league member resorts to
war in disregard of Articles XII,
XIII, or XV, it has committed an

GENEVA, Sept. 26 (/P) — The
council of the League of Nations
solemnly warned Italy and Ethiopia
today against war.
. At the same time it constituted it
self into a committee to draft a re
port with recommendations for set
tlement of the East African conflict
and to consider, meanwhile, if "any
thing further can be done to safe
guard peace."
Should either nation start hostili
ties before December 4, the league
warned, it will be considered to
have committed an act of war against
all league members. This would
automatically call for punitive steps.
Air Patrol Suggested
One suggestion for a further safe
guard for peace was made in in
formal discussion in league lobbies.
11: was to send a league air patrol
to Ltliiopia which could act as "the
eyes of the covenant" along the
frontier of the African kingdom.
League observers from the sky,
it was asserted, could report ac
curately and instantly if hostili
ties began on the border and
could give the council vital assist
ance in the task of determining
the aggressor.
In Rome the league's proposal for
a three months' truce between Italy
and Ethiopia got a cool reception
and "ii cedom of action" was the offi
cial watchword.
The Briiish navy, whose presence
in the Mediteranean is the cause of
gra\ e anxiety hei-e, failed to modify
11 Duce's intentions in East Africa.
Italian officials said, "Italy will
listen to what the League of Nations
may say, but without promising to
wait until after the boggy paths to
Addis Ababa becomes dry enough
to support its army."
Mussolini Will Answer
Since Premier Mussolini may an
swer the league's proposal in his
own graphic words after a cabinet
meeting Saturday, officials avoided
any too emphatic rejection of the
truce idea.
While these things were happen
ing, a Reuters (British) News
Agency dispatch to London from
Crete, Greece, said an Italian war
hip took soundings off the north
west coast of the island yesterday
and then departed.
Another Reuters dispatch from
Atlu ns said today five British sub
marines arrived at Astako, Gulf of
Patras, Greece.
Italians Don't Vote
By unanimous vote, the league
council today decided to proceed in
the Italo-Ethiopian dispute under
Article XV of the covenant. With
the Italian delegates refraining
from voting, the council ruled this
article was in operation as from
September 4.
