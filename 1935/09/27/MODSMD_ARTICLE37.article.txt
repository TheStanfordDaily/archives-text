# Utility Head Framed Him, Claims Billings
## 
### 
Revelations of how Warren K. |
Billings, co-defendant of Tom Moo- !
ney in the Preparedness Day bomb
ing trial, assertedly was "framed" ;
by Martin Swanson, public utility i
detective, were related today by the
Folsom prisoner in the same court- j
room at San Francisco's HaLll of
Justice where he told his story once !
before, nineteen years ago.
Billings said he was arrested by
men brought by Swanson to ane
Hospital, whex-e he was sitting in the
rotunda waiting for a prescription
to be filled. Previously, Swanson 1

had intimated the accused bomber
might get a job from the P. G. & E.,
and had also offered Billings $50000
if he would admit Mooney had told
him of connection with the outrage,
the prisoner testified.
Again, the famous story of gun
powder supposedly found in the
basement of the home of Edward D.
Nolan, Los Angeles machinist, was
brought to light.
Nolan heatedly denied he had ever
been given the opportunity to clear
away the mystery of the basement's
contents.
