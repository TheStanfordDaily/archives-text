# Vets Choose Leader For Bonus Fight
## Riotous Meeting Closes With Election Of New President 
### 
ST. LOUIS, Sept. 26 (/P).â€”A tu
multous convention of the Ameri
can Legion ended late today with the
election of J. Ray Murphy of lowa
to lead the world war veterans in a
renewed fight for immediate cash
payment of the bonus.
Tonight special trains sped in all
directions from St. Louis, and high
ways were crowded with motor
cars, as the thousands who attended
the 17th national meeting turned
homeward.
In a colorful closing session, fea
tured by booes, cat-calls and march
ing, standing waving delegations, the
veterans called on Congress to con
sider the bonus question without ref
erence to "issues of government fi
lce or theories of currency with
which the Legion does not intend to
become involved."
The action, strengthening the de
mand made by the Legion at its
Miami, Fla., convention last year,
was an emphatic disapproval of con
gressional passage of the later vetoed
Patman bill, which provided for bon
us payment thrcugh the issuance of
new currency.
The author of the bill, Represen
tative Wright Patman of Texas, a
legionnaire, provoked a stormy 45-
minute debate when he appeared on
the floor to speak against the resolu
tion.
His remarks barely audible in a
chorus of booes and handclapping,
the congressman pleaded with the
delegates to leave the method of
bonus financing to Congress.
The convention was in a frenzy,
its delegates milling on the floor,
when Representative W. B. McFar
lane, also of Texas, launched into
similar argument.
Wielding his gavel so vigorously
he broke a table, National Com
mander Frank N. Belgrano, Jr., was
unable to maintain order as the
heated debate reached its climax
with the plea by Representative
Charles Halleck of Indiana, not to
"tie inflation or expansion around
the neck of the bonus."
With a deafening roar, the 1,207
delegates, lustily aided by non
delegate legionnaires who crowded
the 3,600-seat hall to its doors,
roared approval of the bonus de
mand. ,
The adopted resolution asked for
immediate cash payment of adjusted
compensation on certificates, can
cellation of accrued interest and re
fund of interest paid.
