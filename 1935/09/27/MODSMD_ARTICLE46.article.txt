# Campus Gets Improvements
## 
### 
In addition to several new houses,
old Stanford students were pleased
to note, upon returning, that the
University had not been idle during
the summer months and that many
needed improvements had been
made under the direction of a crew
of over 200 men employed by the
Corporation Yard.
One of the principal jobs which
was undertaken was that of re
pairing and retiling the roofs of
both the History and Engineering
buildings. Drilling a new well in
back of the Convalescent Home for
campus use and the laying of 4800
feet of both steel and transcite pipe
was also accomplished.
Other projects included the re
decorating of the new dormitory,
The Oaks, in Palo Alto, the painting
of several rooms in the History and
Bacteriology buildings, the install
ing of a new elevator in the Union
kitchen, the remodeling of the Art
Gallery, and the redecoration of the
Biology building, in which a new
ventilating system is at present be
ing installed.
