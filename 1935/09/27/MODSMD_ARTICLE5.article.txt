# Wilbur Warns Against 4 B's
## Yost, Culver Welcome Returned Students 
### 
Emphasizing the importance of
"living creatively" to the. assembly
audience yesterday morning, Presi
dent Ray Lyman Wilbur, Dean Mary
Yost, and Dean George B. Culver
welcomed students, both new and
old, back to the Farm.
Replacing Dr. Wilbur's familial?
dictum that "gasoline and alcohol
do not mix" was his more inclusive
statement that "Stanford has no
place for the 4 B's: Busters, Boozers,
Borrowers, and Bums."
Warns Students
Though Dr. Wilbur struck out
against the evils of "narcotics," his
talk less resembled Dean Culver's
warning to "avoid liquor, card-play
ing, destruction of property, and
procrastination" than it did the
pleading of Dean Yost to balance
academic and social life so that they
complement rather than conflict
with each other.
In reference to the widely dis
cussed technological unemployment,
Dr. Wilbur supported his view that
the world was decidedly not stand
ing still by tracing the swift devel
opment in the automobile and oil
industries, in the improvement of
highways, and in the cinema world
during the relatively short period
of time since the founding of Stan
ford.
Stay on Campus
"You will never get another op
portunity to improve the mind that
God gave you. Make this the center
of your activity," Dr. Wilbur con
cluded, in urging students to stay
upon the campus.
