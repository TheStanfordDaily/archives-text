# Frosh Coach Gives Team Tough Drill
## Yearling Weight On Par With Varsity; Line Averages 193 
### 
That much talked about line of
this year's Stanford freshman foot
ball squad has been rightly called a
beefy unit. In weight it far exceeds
the usual run of freshman forward
walls and, if 163-pound right guard
Bob Shreve is discounted in the fig
uring, compares favorably with the
Indian varsity line. Average per man
for six of the papooses is 198 pounds.
Shreve drops it to 193, still far above
the usual figure.
Yesterday afternoon's practicc
saw Coach Jimmy Bradshaw con
centrate his efforts on the third
and fourth stringers while super
vising a spirited scrimmage among
the reserve material.
Assistant Coach John Bunn di
rected the hefty first and second
teams in a dummy scrimmage de
signed to iron out some of the diffi
culties in timing and co-ordination,
which have been ruining the effec
tiveness of some of the more in
tricate plays during recent practice
sessions.
Bradshaw's squad, unless hit by
injuries, which have not cropped
up to any great extent as yet,
should come onto the field in lull
strength for the Sacramento J.C.
game a week from tomorrow.
Following is the first string at the
present writing: Butler, right end;
Zagar, right tackle; Shreve, right
guard; Sutton, center; MacMillan.
left guard; Carnahan, left tackle;
Cummings, left end; Gamier, quar
terback; Kirsch, right half; Fay or
Veenker, left half; deWitt, full.
