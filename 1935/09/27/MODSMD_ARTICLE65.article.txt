# 85 Report For Boxing Classes
## 
### 
With Ihe intercollegiate meets
and the all-University novice cham
pionships in the offing, boxing will
get under way next week when over
85 would-be champs start regular
workouts. This is the largest en
rollment in boxing classes for nearly
eight years, according to Coach My
ron Schall, and from this number
ho expects to develop some real
fighters.
Of course there are some of the
old-timers back, including Sims de
Veuve, light-heavy champ of the
Pacific Coast, all set to push more
than a little leather into the faces
of their opponents. With the wal
lop that de Veuve packs he can be
counted on to win many a fight via
the K.O. route. In the middleweight
class is Frank Mynderse, another
hard hitter and one that should go a
long way. Other men to bolster up
the squad are Ralph Purdy and
Richard Winzler in the light-weight
class and John Fowler in the heavy
weights, all of whom are good. These
are but a few of the outstanding
candidates and with the others that
are sure to come up from the ranks,
Stanford should have a plenty tough
outfit awaiting the opening gong of
the intercollegiate meets.
Regarding the much discussed
Baer-Louis brawl of Tuesday night,
Schall merely gave a disgusted grunt
i.nd remarked that Baer evidently
quit. "Any man that gets counted
out on one knee has no fight in him,"
was all he had to say for Maxie.
