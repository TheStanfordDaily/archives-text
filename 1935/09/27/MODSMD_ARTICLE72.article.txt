# Football Points To 1935 as Best Year
## 
### ROBERT BERNARD 
Football is in for a championship
year—east, middle-west, south, and
far-west. All observers agree that
not only will great teams be on the
gridirons of the nation but that more
and higher priced seats will be sold
to millions of rooters. A big year for
teams and box offices.
Princeton Tops East
In the East Princeton under Fritz
Crisler's direction is expected to
have its own way. But here's one
writer who expects that astonishing
Yale team of last year to keep up its
end-of-the-season performance and
give the Princeton Tigers plenty of
headaches.
In any rating of eastern football
| the Pittsburgh Panthers have to be
considered sooner or later—usually
sooner. Coach Jock Sutherland
whispers to intimates that he has
another great combination to take
the place of last year's graduates.
Big Ten Strong
In the Middle West the Big Ten
i expects to go to town with everyone
but Michigan figuring on a piece of
pie. Sports commentators are pick
ing Ohio State and Minnesota to di
vide honors—they won't meet this
fall. But Chicago is about due for a
! bang-up season. Clark Shaughnessy
! has a veteran team built around all
j American halfback Jay Berwanger.
Farther west the Big Six holds
sv/ay. Nebraska is the favorite.
However, the Huskers can expect
trouble from, the lowly Oklahoma
Sooners who have a new head coach
in Captain BilT Jones. Jones, for
merly at West Point and Louisiana
State, has produced winning teams
out of less likely looking material
than he found at Oklahoma. Never
theless, he told this correspondent
that the boys look mighty light.
Arkansas, the other Big Six threat,
has too much inter-conference com
petition to dominate its own field.
Duke Rated High
Dixieland, divided into two hos
tile camps, is all set to fight a raging
battle. In the Southern Conference,
the Duke Blue Devils are pre-season

tops with North Carolina in second
spot. In the Southeastern Confer
ence it's a different story. Alabama
(remember that team?) should have
little trouble except for Tennessee
and Vanderbilt.
Louisiana State, without "BifT"
Jones, Huey Long, and Quarterback
Walter Sullivan, looks better than
you might expect. The Baton Rouge
Tigers don't have to play Tennessee
or Alabama so they should have no
difficulty in swamping all conference
opponents. "Slats" Hardin, interna
tionally known track star, is ru
mored to be out for a backfleld job
but really they don't need any mate
rial. All last year's regulars except
Sullivan are back and rarin' to
avenge Tulane's surprise victory of
last year. If Louisiana gets by its
first game (with Rice) it should go
through the season with an unblem
ished record. If . . .
In the Southwest Conference all
you hear is Rice, Rice, and more
Rice. McCauley and Wallace are,
according to modest Texans, the
greatest football players that ever
knocked Ernie Nevers aside

Farther west the Big Six holds
sv/ay. Nebraska is the favorite.
However, the Huskers can expect
trouble from, the lowly Oklahoma
Sooners who have a new head coach
in Captain BilT Jones. Jones, for
merly at West Point and Louisiana
State, has produced winning teams
out of less likely looking material
than he found at Oklahoma. Never
theless, he told this correspondent
that the boys look mighty light.
Arkansas, the other Big Six threat,
has too much inter-conference com
petition to dominate its own field.
Duke Rated High
Dixieland, divided into two hos
tile camps, is all set to fight a raging
battle. In the Southern Conference,
the Duke Blue Devils are pre-season

tops with North Carolina in second
spot. In the Southeastern Confer
ence it's a different story. Alabama
(remember that team?) should have
little trouble except for Tennessee
and Vanderbilt.
Louisiana State, without "BifT"
Jones, Huey Long, and Quarterback
Walter Sullivan, looks better than
you might expect. The Baton Rouge
Tigers don't have to play Tennessee
or Alabama so they should have no
difficulty in swamping all conference
opponents. "Slats" Hardin, interna
tionally known track star, is ru
mored to be out for a backfleld job
but really they don't need any mate
rial. All last year's regulars except
Sullivan are back and rarin' to
avenge Tulane's surprise victory of
last year. If Louisiana gets by its
first game (with Rice) it should go
through the season with an unblem
ished record. If . . .
In the Southwest Conference all
you hear is Rice, Rice, and more
Rice. McCauley and Wallace are,
according to modest Texans, the
greatest football players that ever
knocked Ernie Nevers aside
Football is in for a championship
year—east, middle-west, south, and
far-west. All observers agree that
not only will great teams be on the
gridirons of the nation but that more
and higher priced seats will be sold
to millions of rooters. A big year for
teams and box offices.
Princeton Tops East
In the East Princeton under Fritz
Crisler's direction is expected to
have its own way. But here's one
writer who expects that astonishing
Yale team of last year to keep up its
end-of-the-season performance and
give the Princeton Tigers plenty of
headaches.
In any rating of eastern football
| the Pittsburgh Panthers have to be
considered sooner or later—usually
sooner. Coach Jock Sutherland
whispers to intimates that he has
another great combination to take
the place of last year's graduates.
Big Ten Strong
In the Middle West the Big Ten
i expects to go to town with everyone
but Michigan figuring on a piece of
pie. Sports commentators are pick
ing Ohio State and Minnesota to di
vide honors—they won't meet this
fall. But Chicago is about due for a
! bang-up season. Clark Shaughnessy
