# Cub's Pennant Plans Delayed
## 
### 
ST. LOUIS, Sent. 26 (A 5 ). â€”Rain-
fall, as steady as the march of the
carefree Chicago Cubs, washed out
I Charlie Grimm's plans to clinch the
National League pennant today and
gave the four down and four to go
St. Louis Cardinals a merciful rest
for a final doubleheader rally to
| morrow.
The final hopes of the faded and
worn world's champions will be
the Dean brothers in tomorrow's
twin bill, starting a( 12:45 p.m.
(Central Standard Time). Given
the "amazing" record of four days'
| rest. Dizzy will fire all he's got in
a desperate attempt (o snap the
Cub 19-game winning streak in the
opener. If he succeeds, Brother
Paul, at his own request, will pitch
the second. Should the great Dizzy
I fail, it will be all over.
I "General" Bill Lee, Giant right
| bander whom the Cubs purchased
' from the Cardinal farm at Columbus
two years ago for $35,000, will op
pose the rested Dizzy in a mound
duel that promises to be almost as
t exciting as the victorious 1 to 0
battle of Lonnie Warneke over
Brother Paul yesterday.
I "We'll clinch the pennant tomor
row with Lee," shouted Grimm.
, "Maybe this rain is a break for the

Cardinals, but I figure it is a bigger
one for us. It's a tough job winning
a doubleheader even from an eighth
place team, so why should we wor
ry?"
