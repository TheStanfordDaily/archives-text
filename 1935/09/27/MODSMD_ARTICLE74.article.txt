# Twenty-Five Frosh Netmen Try for Team
## Ladder Positions Will Be Decided Upon Soon 
### 
Twenty-five players, none of
whom can be rated as an outstand
ing choice to capture the coveted
number one position on this season's
freshman tennis squad, have signed
up with Tennis Coach Elwyn Bugge
and have begun strenuous practice.
Bugge stated that, although he has
a number of racket-wielders who
boast top-ranking high school posi
tions and look very good on paper,
he can't tell how the team will shape
up until he has had a chance to see
the prospects in action against each
other over a period of a couple of
weeks.
During most of the first quarter
the Papooses will spend their time
practicing in informal matches
against anyone they choose, and
then, when they have had time to
get used to the courts and condi
tions on the Farm, they will be rated
on all available evidence and given
ladder positions.
From this time until the beginning
of team matches in the spring the
boys will be occupied in trying to
better or retain their positions dur
ing ladder challenge matches with
those ranked below them.
