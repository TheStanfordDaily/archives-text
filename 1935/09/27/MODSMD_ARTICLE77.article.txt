ANOTHER LITTLE WORRY
FOR TINY
Pet pastime of most everyone who
follows Tiny Thornhill's 1935 grid
gang is the collecting and tabulat
ing of Tiny's worries. The reason
for such action seems to lie in the
fact that it's pretty hard to find any
thing that Tiny could worry about
these days and thus the man who
does succeed in scaring up a "worry"
is really accomplishing something.
First "worry" that received any
real attention and publicity was
Thornhill's lack of reserve strength.
But before long that field was worn
smooth and something new had to
be uncovered.
It was about that time that atten
tion was drawn to one specific line
of reserves—the tackles—and "wor
ry" number two was hashed over
pretty thoroughly.
And now a new "worry" has come
into existence. Actually Tiny is not
spending any sleepless nights over
this new one but it does merit a
mention.
DON'T LET THE
NAME BOTHER YOU
Worry number 3 is Streptococcus
no, don't run, it's not half as bad
as it sounds. Just the technical
name for a type of throat infection
something like a bad cold that has
been making the rounds with some
of the football men.
Wes Muller, Fred Williams, and
Don McMillan have been fighting
off cases of the strepto and Tiny is
hoping that it doesn't do any spread
ing. Wes and Fred have been out
of uniform since early in the week.
A1 Masters, graduate manager, is
another to catch this new edition of
"flu" and has spent the best part of
this week at home.
The point that might have Tiny a
little worried is the posibility of the
strepto taking a crack at some more
of the men. With so much bodily
contact that might easily happen,
but if luck is with the Stanford In
dian, it won't.
Johnny Reisner, reserve halfback,
is another who has been missing
practice lately. In his case it's not
the streptococcus (darn that word)
but a game leg that receives the
blame.
Reisner's weak knee seems to lie
at the bottom of his trouble. It's
all right when he's running straight
ahead but when he has to do any
cutting to one side or the other, the
bad limb revolts. He was back in
uniform but taking it easy last night.

smooth and something new had to
be uncovered.
It was about that time that atten
tion was drawn to one specific line
of reserves—the tackles—and "wor
ry" number two was hashed over
pretty thoroughly.
And now a new "worry" has come
into existence. Actually Tiny is not
spending any sleepless nights over
this new one but it does merit a
mention.
DON'T LET THE
NAME BOTHER YOU
Worry number 3 is Streptococcus
no, don't run, it's not half as bad
as it sounds. Just the technical
name for a type of throat infection
something like a bad cold that has
been making the rounds with some
of the football men.
Wes Muller, Fred Williams, and
Don McMillan have been fighting
off cases of the strepto and Tiny is
hoping that it doesn't do any spread
ing. Wes and Fred have been out
of uniform since early in the week.
A1 Masters, graduate manager, is
another to catch this new edition of
"flu" and has spent the best part of
this week at home.
The point that might have Tiny a
little worried is the posibility of the
strepto taking a crack at some more
of the men. With so much bodily
contact that might easily happen,
but if luck is with the Stanford In
dian, it won't.
Johnny Reisner, reserve halfback,
is another who has been missing
practice lately. In his case it's not
the streptococcus (darn that word)
but a game leg that receives the
blame.
Reisner's weak knee seems to lie
at the bottom of his trouble. It's
all right when he's running straight
ahead but when he has to do any
cutting to one side or the other, the
bad limb revolts. He was back in
uniform but taking it easy last night.

ANOTHER LITTLE WORRY
FOR TINY
Pet pastime of most everyone who
follows Tiny Thornhill's 1935 grid
gang is the collecting and tabulat
ing of Tiny's worries. The reason
for such action seems to lie in the
fact that it's pretty hard to find any
thing that Tiny could worry about
these days and thus the man who
does succeed in scaring up a "worry"
is really accomplishing something.
First "worry" that received any
real attention and publicity was
Thornhill's lack of reserve strength.
But before long that field was worn
smooth and something new had to
be uncovered.
It was about that time that atten
tion was drawn to one specific line
of reserves—the tackles—and "wor
ry" number two was hashed over
pretty thoroughly.
And now a new "worry" has come
into existence. Actually Tiny is not
