# Opening Games Lift the Lid On Football Season
## Coast Elevens 'Forget Stanford' and Face First Opponents 
### 
Football machines up and down
the Pacific Coast will momentarily
forget the year's work they have set
for themselves—that of beating
Stanford—and concentrate on look
ing at themselves objectively during
season openers this week-end.
Leading in the breach of quietude
on the western front will be a drama
featuring Santa Clara and the Uni
versity of San Francisco at Kezar
Stadium. These are two of the
teams rated as distinct threats to
Stanford's supremacy, and both have
been grooming themselves exclu
sively for this opener since practice
was officially begun on September
14.
Santa Clara, with one of the
heaviest and speediest lines in Bron
co history appearing in front of an
experienced and competent back
field, will rank as favorite over the
slightly green but potentially pow
erful Dons.
University of California fans are
anxious to watch the first edition of
Stub Allison's new deal in Golden
Bear athletics. California tackles
the Cal Aggies and Whittier in a
double-header at Berkeley Satur
day afternoon. The games, of course,
will resolve into a question of "how
many points" rather than "who will
win."
U.S.C. and Montana will put on a
slightly interesting show in the
Southland. The game is a registered
Coast Conference conflict, but the
Trojans are expected to meet only
slight opposition.
Idaho's Vandals, under direction
of a new coach, may fui'nish the first
major surprise of the season in
Seattle Saturday afternoon when
they take on Washington's slow
starting Huskies in a conference

game. Coach Jimmy Phelan of the
Huskies is having trouble getting his
j team organized, and Idaho will be in
I good shape for the meeting,
j Willamette, who defeated San
I Jose State last week-end, will play
j Oregon State at Corvallis, and Gon
j zaga, one of the better northern in-
I dependents, will test Oregon In a
i game at Portland.
U.C.L.A. meets Utah in Los An
! geles tonight in the first intersec
tional game on the Coast this sea
son. Pre-game dope here rates the
two as nearly a toss-up.
St. Mary's faces slight trouble in

meeting her jinx of last season, the
lowly Nevada Wolves, who tipped
the Moragans in a moment of Gael '
over-confidence during the 1934
campaign.
