# Roosevelt On Way To Fair In Sea Trip
## Western Trip Marked By Four Speeches, Two Over Network 
### 
WASHINGTON, Sept. 26 (/P).—
A transcontinental jaunt bearing
speechmaking omens of 1936's cam
paign furor drew President Roose
velt westward tonight toward a Pa
cific vacation cruise.
Four talks, two over nation-wide
radio hook-ups, were scheduled by
the White House as Mr. Roosevelt
gave last-minute directional touches
today to a horde of governmental
problems, both foreign and domes
tic.
The New Deal chieftain will pause
in the heart of the Middle West
grain belt Saturday to make an in
formal address to farmers at Fre
mont, Neb. Political-minded looked
for a discussion of the AAA, which
Chairman Henry P. Fletcher of the
Republican National Committee has
termed a "problem" in the western
G.O.P. outlook.
Then at Boulder Canyon Dam
on Monday Mr. Roosevelt will
broadcast a talk after an introduc
tion by Nevada's Senator Pittman.
An informal talk was scheduled
for Los Angeles Tuesday after
noon and a second national broad
cast at San Diego Wednesday af
ternoon.
Special significance was attached
in political quarters to the two radio
speeches. At the mammoth Boulder
Dam project, it was expected Mr.
Roosevelt will outline his views on
the major issue at the 1936 polls.
A speech of more general nature
appeared in prospect for San Diego.
With this stop behind, Mr. Roosevelt
looked for a leisurely 20-day fishing
cruise down the Pacific Coast and
through the Panama Canal to the
Atlantic.
With the President will travel
the two bosses of the work relief
campaign, Harry L. Hopkins and
Secretary Ickcs. Only in recent
weeks were bitter differences be
tween the two over the program
settled by presidential orders
turning the bulk of the $4,000,000,-
000 over to Hopkins.
One of the longest special trains
to puli out of the capital in recent
years was made up for the presi
dential trip. Along the way political
leaders were expected to get aboard
for brief visits.
