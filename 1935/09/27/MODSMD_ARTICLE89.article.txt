Johnny Drofnats, half-wit cousin
of the great seer of Cardinal foot
ball, dashed into the sports editor's
draft-swept sanctum at a late hour
last night, madly waving racing
forms.
"I can't pick 'em," he moaned,
"but boy can I deesh it out. Thorn
hill says Stanford fears San Jose,
but De Groot has gray hairs worry
ing about how the Indians might
slip in a lucky pass and spoil his
absotively unspotted season rec
ord."
(Note. —San Jose's record to date:
Spartans, 000; Spartan fifth string
and towel-carriers, 000. Total points
not yet scored, even less.)
"If the wind blows from the East,
and the bat swings in the belfry
tower, the Indians should romp
home an easy victor by two baskets.
But if the field she be muddy, Mus
sliter may come up fast and nip the
Indians at the cross-bars.
"Yet my cousin feels peanuts itch
ing in the Stanford boys' pretty
pantsie-wanties will cause them to
rant and roll; 40-0 would be mighty
mild. If only San Jose can bring a
peanut whistle, they could beat the
Indians to put them in the cellar
and make the Esscee game a real
tussle.
"This new bilateral force - ap
proach will have the Cards shuf
fling mad. I predict the Spartans
3-2, with Buddy Baer copping the
preliminary.
