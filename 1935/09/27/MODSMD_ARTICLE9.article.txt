# Cal Leaders Blame Reds In Boycott
## All Hearst Enterprises In Proposed Ban by U.C. Organizations 
### 
BERKELEY, Sept. 26 (CIPA).—
That communists were responsible
for a suggested boycott of Hearst
enterprises, sponsored by chapters
of the National Students' League
and the League for Industrial De
mocracy at the University of Cali
fornia, was the declaration yester
day of Arthur Harris, president of
the A.S.U.C., the Daily Californian
reported.
The campaign against the publish
ers' newspapers, radio stations, and
motion picture enterprises was
started Wednesday to "end Hearst's
rotten influence on this campus, at
least," and in protest of his attempt
"to suppress freedom of expression
in classrooms," according to a state
ment reportedly made by John L.
Rockwell, L.I.D. member. His al
leged indictment included con
demnation of Hearst Metrotone
newsreels as channels of propa
ganda for the promotion of nation
alistic spirit and militarism, the
newspaper said.
Concurring with Rockwell in his
opinions were Dyke Brown, junior
men's representative and president
of the university Y.M.C.A., Kenneth
May, vice-president of the group,
and Charles Rosenthal, member of
the Y.M.C.A. cabinet, the Daily Cal
ifornian reported.
Student participation in the
boycott was deemed "entirely a
matter for individual student de
cision" by President Harris, as
campus opinion was shown to be
in opposition to the move.
"The Hearst boycott is dangerous
and unprincipled," President Harris
is reported to have said in an official
statement from A.S.U.C. offices. "It
was originally instigated by com
munists, who themselves advocate
a system that would destroy all lib
erty. The purpose of the boycott is
to injure Mr. Hearst for saying what
he honestly believes. The radicals
are guilty of attacking his right of
free speech."
Meanwhile, Richard W. Dettering,
varsity debater, hazarded the opin
ion that radicals were fomenting the
boycott for the purpose of coercing
the university into supporting com
munistic activities and Harry
Bridges, president of the Interna
tional Longshoremen's Association
in San Francisco.
