MOSCOW, Sept. 26 (/P).—The ra
tion system of sale of some prime
food products, under which Soviet
workers had cards entitling them to
make purchases in "closed" stores
at extremely low prices, went by the
boards today.
A government decree abolished
ration shop sale of meat, sugar, fish,
butter, and potatoes, throwing the
buying into open shops, where the
general public paid higher prices,
and substituting one fixed price for
the previous double price system.
