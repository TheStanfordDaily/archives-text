The Quad's editorial and business
offices were flooded yesterday with
an unusually large number uf un
derclassmen registering for tryout
work on Stanford's yearbook. Forty
students reported to Editor Don
Hansen; 18 to Business Manager
Chuck Fontius.
With a month's probationary pe
riod before them, tryoutees begin
working at the annual's offices next
week. Those with Hansen will find
.heir hours listed Monday. Business
tryoutees meet with Fontius at 7:30
Tuesday.
Students who failed to register
today may still sign up Monday and
Tuesday. The business staff espe
cially needs more lower division
men.
