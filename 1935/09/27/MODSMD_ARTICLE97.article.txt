NEW YORK, Sept. 26 </P).—ln
"crackdown" style, Hugh S. John
son, retiring WPA administrator for
New York City, flatly warned busi
ness leaders today that the govern
ment could not go on playing "Santa

"One of these days somebody is
going to kill Santa Claus or put
such a crimp in him that he*won't
be abie to keep your problems
asleep by waving a wand over them.
"You know as well as I do that
the federal government can't go on
pouring $5.u00,000,000 a year in
soothing syrup to keep the unem
ployment problem from raising bed
-lam all over this nation.
"You are sitting on a neat little
powder mine with the fuse lighted.
You have been pretty somnolent
about it because Uncle Sam was at
tending to it for you. About the
least you can do now is to open your
pyes and take one good long look
at it."
Reduces WPA Wages
"Riot, rebellion, or revolution in
two weeks time would be the in
evitable result of the cutting off of
relief," he added.
Johnson's warning on unemploy
ment came immediately alter the
WPA administrator announced a
50 per cent cut in working hours
for WPA laborers and an accom
panying reduction in wages.
The new proposal, in line with
union labor's demands for a wage
equivalent to the prevailing wage
in private industry, reduces work
ing hours from 120 a month to 60
and sets a wage of from $80 to
$93.50 for skilled labor. Interme
diate workers are to get from $60.50
to $70. The result increase hour
