# Ex Committee Will Approve Theater Loan
## Student Group To Grant Additional $35,000 Tomorrow Twenty Years To Pay Start of Construction Set For November 
### 
Approval by Ex Committee Tues
day of an additional $35,000 for con
struction of Stanford's memorial
theater was confidently expected to
day by Bob Gros, student manager.
This amount, like the original
grant of $325,000 previously award
ed on a tentative estimate pre
sented by Comptroller Almon E.
Roth, will be advanced by the uni
versity during the next year, and
will be returned to the treasury from
yearly profits of the Union and from
the extra $1 registration fee. The
total length of time for amortization
is now 20 years, he said.
In an interview, Gros declared
that he anticipated no question as to
the approving of the additional
amount.
Approval Unquestioned
"The first award was granted with
the understanding that the amount
requested was purely a tentative
estimate, subject to increase if final
plans indicated an additional amount
would be necessary," he stated.
Ground will be broken for the
half-million dollar structure in No
vember, Roth revealed, with con
crete pouring scheduled for comple
tion by the start of the rainy season.
Steel erection will begin in January,
and the building is expected to be
ready for use by the opening of fall
quarter, 1936.
Architects are now completing de
tailed plans for the building, to be a
Class A steel-reinforced concrete
structure with provisions for two
auditoriums, one seating 1700 and
the other a Little Theater suitable
for class meetings or small plays.
Plans call for an elaborately equip
ped stage block, with dressing
rooms, green rooms, and scenery
docks for the accommodation of ac
tors and technicians.
Architecturally Unique
Usually the most unatti'active fea
ture of play houses, the "block" will
be so buttressed by surrounding
floors that it will not project notice
ably above the general roof level of
the structure, perspective drawing
show.
Other issues tentatively slated for
Ex Committee discussion include the
new Brooke appointment system,
which requires written applications
from each candidate for the position,
Daily funds, which may be held
over until next week, granting of
dates for campus activities, and any
-measures brought up by this noon.
