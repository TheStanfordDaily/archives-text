# Union Ends Strike Ban On Cargoes
## Longshore Workers Wait For Labor Relations Board Decision 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 29 (/l^. â€”
Prospects for a peaceful settlement
of the current San Francisco water
front tie-up appeared today when
Union bargemen and warehousemen
suddenly lifted their ban against the
handling of "unfair" cargo on the
piers.
The warehousemen, affiliated with
the Longshoremen's Union, an
nounced they had decided to lift the
ban on goods produced by the Santa
Cruz Packing Company of Oakland
pending action by the Regional La
bor Relations Board on a complaint
to be filed by the workers.
Bargemen Join
Union bargemen, also affiliated
with the Longshore Union, said they
had agreed to permit the working of
cargo received at the piers from the
River Lines, Inc., pending a discus
sion with representatives of the com
pany in a meeting with Labor Rela
tions Board officials tomorrow.
Longshoremen originally had re
fused to handle San Francisco pier
cargo from the Packing Company
and the River Lines because the
warehousemen and bargemen, re
spectively, were on strike against the
packing firm and the River Lnies.
The waterfront situation reached
a crucial point last week when
Federal Arbitrator M. C. Sloss
ruled that the longshoremen had
no right to refuse to handle the so
called i- hot cargo."
Waterfront employers, who had
spread this "hot cargo" among many
San Francisco piers to bring the sit
uation to a climax, began "suspend
ing from future employment all
longshoremen who declined to han
dle the disputed goods.
Employers unofficially reported to
day they had the names of 1,440 San
Francisco longshoremen on their
"suspended" list.
They said they had been notified
1,710 union longshoremen would be
available for work tomorrow but
that more than 2,800 were needed.
Although official advices were
lacking from both sides as to what
effect the developments would
have on the general waterfront
situation, it was reported the em
ployers had decided to accept men
from the "suspended" list pro
vided they would sign agreements
to work all cargo in the future.
Action of the bargemen and ware
housemen came after Walter G.
Mathewson, federal labor depart
ment conciliator, announced the
hearing tomorrow on the River Lines
strike.
