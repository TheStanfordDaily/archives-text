# Moliere Play to Be Read On Thursday
## 
### 
"Les Precieuses Ridicules," fam
ous Moliere play set for 8:25 Thurs
day night in the Assembly Hall,
brings to its audience a piece of
comedy-drama so effective that it
has met with immense success ever
â–  since its inception in 1659.
! Preciosity, the movement which
j the great French philosopher-come
\ dian, Moliere, so cleverly satirizes,
! has never died. Born simultaneously
j in most Europe countries about the
I 16th century, the movement is char
acterized by the attempt of the
bourgeoise, even of the higher and
titled classes, attempting to write
and speak in a manner unlike the
ordinary. This attempt resulted in
literary and spoken work being ei
ther super-clever and refined oi
extra-course and vulgar.
First Comic Satire
The first true dramatic comic
[satire of the contemporary foible:-
of the French people. "Les Preci
! uses" is Moliere's attack on the over
; refinement and affectation of hi:
countrymen.
William Leonard Swartz, profes
j sor of romantic languages and direc
tor of the play, explains the choice

of the drama for production at Stan
ford. "Moliere presents in such a
clever and amusing way a move
ment so typical of many countries
and so important in European civi
lization, we believe it will be well
received here."
Even the new world did not es
cape preciosity. Though it did not
come until the early 1920'5, the
movement reached America with a
"bang" in the style of post-war writ
ers of the "flaming youth"' era. F.
Scott Fitzgerald, according to Pro
fessor Swartz, probably led the
American movement.
Always Will Please
"Les Precieuses Ridicules," says
Andrew Lang, noted Moliere author
| ily, "can never cease to please whilo
, literary affectation exists. The mod
ern audience, however, may spare
some sympathy for the poor heroines
' who do not wish, in courtship, to
! 'begin with marriage,' but prefer
first to have some less formidable
acquaintance with their wooers."
Formerly scheduled to rise at 8:15
j o'clock, the curtain will go up at
8:25 o'clock. The admission charge
( is 25 cents.
