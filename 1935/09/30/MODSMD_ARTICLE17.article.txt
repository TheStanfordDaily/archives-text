BERKELEY. Sept. 30 (CIPA).â€”
3n the heels of a suggested boycott
)f Hearst enterprises by University
California chapters of the League
'or Industrial Democracy and the
National Students' League, an or
ganization protesting the misrepre
sentation of student sentiment by
radical groups and the "rape of true
American idealism by unholy rad
cal elements" had been founded to
day, the Daily Californian reported.
Included among the organizers are
Richard W. Dettering, varsity de
bater, open forum member, and
protestor of the Hearst boycott,
Robert Denhardt, varsity debate
Tianager, John R. Hector, chairman
of the Welfare Council, Hardy M.
Smith, president of the Senate De
bating Society, and Edith Tilton,
member of the Open Forum board.
The society is to be called the
"Sentries of American Youth" and
has for its purpose the combat
ting of both Communism and
Fascism, the student paper re
ported.
Dettering said plans of the organ
ization were "liberal and non-parti
san" with the society's constitution
modeled closely after that of the
United States. No members of the
Communist party would be admit
ted to Membership, he is reported to
have said. Communists could not
conscientiously subscribe to the con
stitution of the Sentries, Miss Tilton
explained.
Instead of strong-arm vigilant
ism, peaceful direction of public
opinion against insidious influ
ences will mark the organization's
activity, Dettering said, according
to the student paper.
Five organizers will form the Sen
tries' cabinet, pledged to support the
following constitution: "We, the
Sentries of American Youth, stand
for the American ideals expressed
by the Preamable of the Constitu
tion of the United States, advocating
the formation of a more perfect
Union, the establishment of justice,
the insurance of domestic tranquil
lity, the provision for the common
defense, the promotion of the gen
eral welfare, and finally for the de
fense of the University of California
from all insidious influence."
Membership in the group is to
be restricted, and invitations will
be issued to "prominent students"
to join the Sentries.
All members will act strictly as
individuals in joining the organiza
tion, the paper said. Meanwhile, Ar
thur Harris, A.S.U.C. president, re
: iterated his statement that the offi-
I cial campus government could make
| neither favorable nor damaging
comment on the Hearst boycott, nor
offer a statement representative of
I campus opinion.
"The advisability of a boycott
| against the Hearst interests is a mat
ter which each individual student
j will have to decide according to the
I dictates of his own personal views
and beliefs," President Harris said
in a communication to the Daily
here.
"Where some would disapprove of
; Mr. Hearst others would commend
him for the interest which he has
! shown in our university. The A.S.
| U.C. could not in all fairness recog
j nize such a boycott drive as repre
j sentative of student opinion on this
j matter."
