as yet resigned from his position on

tee job last spring he was not al
lowed to do so on the technicality
that he could not resign an office
which he had not yet taken over.
Resignation Assured
Gros assures The Daily, however,
that "one minute after Ex Commit
tee comes to order tomorrow night
he will be able to resign and will do
so at once." Upon this assurance,
the election board will be able to go
ahead and open nominations for
candidates to take Gros' place.
Gros also wished to resign his
Men's Council chair as was pre
viously announced but, inasmuch as
he is to be the only old member of
the board, he has been asked by
Dean Culver to remain with the
Council.
