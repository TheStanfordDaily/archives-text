WASHINGTON, Sept. 29 (/P).â€”
New taxes were conditionally ruled
out by President Roosevelt tonight
in a report to the people that im
proving business had fortified the
government's financial position.
Peering into the nation's indus
trial and fiscal future, the chief ex
ecutive saw the curves of tax col
lections and expenditures swinging
toward a meeting point. He predict
ed a big cut in the deficit originally
estimated for the current fiscal year
of 2,936 and another for the next
financial 12 months. But no date
was set for a completely balanced
budget.
