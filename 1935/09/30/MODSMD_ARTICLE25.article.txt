# Roosevelt Hails Filipino Liberty In Utah Speech
## Nation To Hear Address From Boulder Dam 
### 
SALT LAKE CITY. Utah, Sept.
29 (/P). â€”President Roosevelt in a
Sabbath day talk to a tremendous
gathering here today cited Philip
pine independence as the spirit of
America to keep its word and ob
served it would be "a mighty good
thing" for all nations to observe.
He referred to the Philippines in
noting the absence here of George
Dern, Secretary of War and former
governor of Utah, who is en rbute to
the Philippines to represent this gov
ernment at the inauguration of Man
uel Quezon as president of the new
Philippine government.
Late yesterday the presidential
special moved southwestward across
Utah and Nevada to the gigantic
Boulder Canyon Darn in the Colo
rado River.
In dedicating this power and
flood control structure erected by
the government, Mr. Roosevelt to
morrow will deliver perhaps the
principal address of his trip to the
Pacific Coast. It is expected to deal
with power and public utilities and
to lay the foundation for this ap
parent issue in the 1936 election.
The talk will be delivered at 11
a.m., Pacific time, and will be
broadcast on a national radio
hook-up.
The President in making public
the summation of the budget offered
no comment beyond the prepared
statement of "definitely encouraging
factors" and containing the assertion
that new or increased taxes will not
be needed.
The statement did emphasize
that if the attack against the Agri
| cultural Adjustment Act is sus
tained, new taxes would liave to
be found to provide the benefit
payment to farmers.
With Secretary Ickes and Harry
L. Hopkins, the works administra
tors beside him, Roosevelt is review
ing projects along the way. How
ever, there remained considerable
doubt today about the Caddoa Dam
project in the Arkansas River, asked
yestei-day by the Colorado delega
tion. Additional facts have been
asked about this.
