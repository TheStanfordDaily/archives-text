# Grayson Sent To Hospital As Cards Beat S.J.
## Vigna Stars as Indians Roll after Shaky First Period 
### Warren Breed 
Bobby Grayson lies abed in the
Palo Alto hospital today, and what's
worse, he'll be there all week. And
what's still worse, two other mem
bers of Stanford's varsity are there
with him—Woody Adams with a
pulled tendon above his heel and
Bones Hamilton with a badly swoll

Thus Stanford's victory over San

The trouble has been diagnosed as

Clara, and S.C.—may depend upon
how well and how soon it regains
normal strength.
Hamilton and Adams are in better
shape, however. Their chances to
start the U.S.F. game Saturday are
considered good.
Grayson's injury occurred mid
way through the third quarter after
he had cracked through the opposi
tion for an 8-yard gain. That play
marked the last of San Jose's clever
and highly successful opposition, and
in the next 20 minutes the Cards
busied themselves with scoring four
times to make the final count a do
cent 35-0.
The first half saw the Cards in a
slow-motion performance that was
turned back on every hand by the
alert Spartans. Redeeming feature
was Grayson's four-star perform
ance, and his seven completed passes
out of seven tries, the last of which
little Joe Vigna grabbed to crass the
line for the season's first score and a
