# Grayson Sent To Hospital As Cards Beat S.J.
## Vigna Stars as Indians Roll after Shaky First Period 
### Warren Breed 
Bobby Grayson lies abed in the
Palo Alto hospital today, and what's
worse, he'll be there all week. And
what's still worse, two other mem
bers of Stanford's varsity are there
with him—Woody Adams with a
pulled tendon above his heel and
Bones Hamilton with a badly swoll
en arch.
Thus Stanford's victory over San
Jose State Saturday took a heavy
toll. The big booming Portland full
back, who starred brilliantly in the
third quarter behind mediocre sup
port, may still be on the bench when
Stanford meets U.C.L.A. two weeks
hence.
Ankle Ligaments Torn
The trouble has been diagnosed as
some badly torn ligaments in the
ankle joint of the left leg. It's a
pretty serious member, and success
in the next four games after U.S.F.

General admission tickets for
the Stanford-U.S.F. game at
Kezar next Saturday are on
sale today only at the B.A.C.
A special block of seats priced
at $1.25 has been set aside for
the convenience of students
who wish to purchase tickets
for outsiders. Student admis
sion is by A.S.S.U. cards.

Clara, and S.C.—may depend upon
how well and how soon it regains
normal strength.
Hamilton and Adams are in better
shape, however. Their chances to
start the U.S.F. game Saturday are
considered good.
Grayson's injury occurred mid
way through the third quarter after
he had cracked through the opposi
tion for an 8-yard gain. That play
marked the last of San Jose's clever
and highly successful opposition, and
in the next 20 minutes the Cards
busied themselves with scoring four
times to make the final count a do
cent 35-0.
The first half saw the Cards in a
slow-motion performance that was
turned back on every hand by the
alert Spartans. Redeeming feature
was Grayson's four-star perform
ance, and his seven completed passes
out of seven tries, the last of which
little Joe Vigna grabbed to crass the
line for the season's first score and a
relief to the rooting scction.
But after a straight-forward
talking to by Coach Tiny at half
time the Big Red Machine ceased
sputtering and began to roll. After
an exchange of kicks the Cards
started on their own 37-yard line
and didn't stop till Vigna took the
ball 12 yards on a wide end sweep
and scored.
Then they got the ball again on
their 31-yard line. Frank Alustiza,
Bill Paulman, who got off some fine
kicks, and Little Jimmy Coffis alter
nated in a varied attack and Paul
man took it over.
Moscrip Blocks Kick
The next score was easy. Monk
Moscrip, who had been playing a
tremendous game all afternoon,
blocked a Spartan kick on the Spar
tan 26. Paulman eased up to the
seven, and Coffis darted off tackle
and squirmed to the score.
That was the fourth quai'ter, and
the subs began to drift in. They were
supposed to go in earlier, but Dud
De Groot's boys looked good enough
for the first-string until then.
Bones Hamilton, the acting cap

tain, and Joe Vigna were still in,
and for the last touchdown the
former slung a nifty pass to the lat
ter, making the whole play more
than 40 yards and 6 points.
Moscrip and Carl Schott did a
perfect job on the converts, Monk
boosting four, Carl, the other.
After Grayson, and Moscrip, the
good job of the day was done by
Little Joe Vigna, of the Port of
Stockton. It seemed that whenever
the stands began to moan for a score,
the next play would end up with Joe
tucking the ball away and scooting
over the goal line.
Passes Click
Little Joe, who wasn't so big last
year, came back this fall looking
like a flesh-and-blood edition of the
fiat-iron building. And not only did
Little Joe reap much of the pay dirt,
bxit he was blocking like Bones
Hamilton did from his right-half
post last year.
The big thing, though, was the
passing. Grayson, in the second
quarter, completed seven of them
in a row.
