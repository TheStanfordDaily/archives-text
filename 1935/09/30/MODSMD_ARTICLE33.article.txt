# Ethiopians, Britons Italians Stand Firm
## Selassie Warns He Will Mobilize Army Of 2,000,000 Men 
### 
LONDON, Sept. 29 MP). — Great
Britain told France tonight in official I
language she intends to stand firm [
for "steady and collective resistance
to all acts of unprovoked aggres
sion" — whether in Africa or in
Europe.
On a day which saw elections in i
Memel, the little Baltic territory '
which France believes Adolf Hitler J
would like to seize, the British gov
ernment published a note saying any j
idea that British policy was limited
to the Ethiopian situation "would be
a complete misunderstanding."
Sir Samuel Hoare, the foreign sec
retary, made this reservation: that
"procedure under Article XVI of
the Covenant, appropriate as regards
a negative act of failure to fulfill the i
terms of a treaty."
Observers say this might embrace j
both the possibility of the voluntary
surrender of Memel or the Austrian ;
people to German rule despite ter- j
ritorial revision treaties and the j
continued leamiament of Germany
in violation of the Versailles re
strictions.
In Addis Ababa one of Emperor
Haile Selassie's principal counsellors
followed up the Negus' warning to
the League of Nations that he may
Lt forced to order general mobiliza
tion with the statement Ethiopia can
put 2,000.000 men on the march, if
necessary.
At the same time, informants
in Rome said Italy expects an as
sault from Ethiopia when Selassie's
drums have pounded out the gen
eral call for arms.
Political circles in France reflected
tliat nation's alarm for her own safe
ly in the event Mussolini's expected
conquest of Ethiopia divides Europe
into two armed camps.
In Geneva, League of Nations of
ficials thought the League Council
might meet quickly to consider the
Ethiopian emperor's formal warn
ing that mobilization was imminent.
