# Copp Tells Of How He Smelt Wild Ethiops

"It stinks!" said Jim Copp, Chap
pie editor, when interviewed on the
subject of Ethiopia. On a round
the-world trip in the summer of
1931, Copp visited the east coast of
Africa.
"We really didn't get any closer
to Ethiopia than French Somaliland,
but we could smell it from there.
This part of Africa is dry, hot, filthy,
and smelly."
It Stinks
"The day we arrived at the harbor
of Djibouti it was 140 degrees in the
.shade in the coolest part of the boat.
Somaliland had not had any rain
for two years, and the country was
as dry as a Tuesday night lecture,
and as flat as a pun in an account
ancy course."
According to the dean of campus
humorists, the natives live in hor
rible squalor. Their gunny-sack
houses line wretched streets, down
which lepers and beggars walk. The
beggars were subject to mutilation
of arms and face by their parents at
birth, so that they could grow up to
a life of very profitable mendicancy.
Phew-vv
"We were taken by the taxi-driver
out to one lone palm tree in the
midst of a sandy waste, and were
told that this was the beauty spot of
Djibouti. While we drove along, the
natives swarmed over the running
board and made faces, leered, ogled,
and shouted at us. Some of the
faces were really good, too."
"Their attire was simple but ef
fective—almost severe. It consisted
of long, white cotton robes that
looked like nightgowns. Their one
mechanical contrivance in town was
a sewing machine—to sew the robes,
I suppose."
"Mussolini can have Ethiopia if
he can get it," sighed Copp. "lt
stinks!"
