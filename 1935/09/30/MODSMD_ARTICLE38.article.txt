TINY THORNHILL TALKS
AFTER THE GAME
Tiny Thornhill—what did he think
of Saturday's little scare? He was
in the training room when I finally
tracked him down. He sauntered
into the tub room where they were
gingerly lifting Bobby Grayson's
battered ankle out of the bath. He
shot a word—"She feel okay, Bob
by?" "Sorta painful, Tiny."
Then he talked a minute with
Bones Hamilton, who was getting
fixed up for a bad foot. Then a word
or two with Horse Reynolds about
some poor blocking. And then I
caught him.
"What d' ya think about it, Tiny?"
'liny thought plenty; and he said
what he thought. "After they got
going it was all right but right at
lirst things were pretty bad. The
linemen thought every play was go
ing to make a touchdown. They'd
stand up and watch the backfield
start, then maybe they'd do a little
half-hearted blocking."
That was a lot for Tiny to say.
He's been known as the fellow
whose comments have been limited
almost entirely to the phrase "every
thing's going to be all right."
He didn't forget that phrase Sat
urday either. He still thinks that
everything is going to be all right.
He explained that he liked Bobby
Grayson's passing, in fact, he liked
the way the whole passing attack
worked out.
He thought that the backfield
played good ball after they got over
the first periods of tension when
there were a lot of missed blocks
and stumbling runs. And he had just
about the same words to say about
the line.
It was natural that those first two
quarters would be pretty bad. After
all, even a gang of veterans can get
rusty after many months without a
game. Tiny made allowance for
that.
Yes, on Saturday afternoon Tiny
was quite sure that everything
would be all right. But since that
time Bones Hamilton and Woody
Adams have joined Grayson and
Topping on the injured list and Tiny
says his phrase with just a little less
force.
But he remembers that after the
first game last year Stanford had
heavy toll of injuries and every
thing ended up all right. That's the
way he hopes to see it go again this
year and that's why he's still op
timistic.
I'AULMAN INVENTED
A NEW PLAY
Everyone was surprised to see
Stanford using the old suicide play
Saturday. It was one of Pop War
ner's favorites but hasn't been seen
on the Farm play list for some time.
Remember the one when Bill Paul
man went around end on a fake re
verse without any interference at
all.
I asked Tiny about that when 1
had him cornered. I asked him when
he'd decided to use that, and when
he'd had them practice it. His an
swer revealed something new about
the Indians—they don't even need to
practice a play.
"That play was invented right out
there on the field," he told me. It
originally was supposed to be a
double reverse, Grayson to Paul
man to Hamilton. But Paulman
couldn't find Bones so he went right
on around the wrong end alone —and
gained ten yards. After that they
used it again. It gained every time.
And now Stanford has another
play. Tiny's decided to put it on
the list.

half-hearted blocking."
That was a lot for Tiny to say.
He's been known as the fellow
whose comments have been limited
almost entirely to the phrase "every
thing's going to be all right."
He didn't forget that phrase Sat
urday either. He still thinks that
everything is going to be all right.
He explained that he liked Bobby
Grayson's passing, in fact, he liked
the way the whole passing attack
worked out.
He thought that the backfield
played good ball after they got over
the first periods of tension when
there were a lot of missed blocks
and stumbling runs. And he had just
about the same words to say about
the line.
It was natural that those first two
quarters would be pretty bad. After
all, even a gang of veterans can get
rusty after many months without a
game. Tiny made allowance for
that.
Yes, on Saturday afternoon Tiny
was quite sure that everything
would be all right. But since that
time Bones Hamilton and Woody
Adams have joined Grayson and
Topping on the injured list and Tiny
says his phrase with just a little less
force.
But he remembers that after the
first game last year Stanford had
heavy toll of injuries and every
thing ended up all right. That's the
way he hopes to see it go again this
year and that's why he's still op
timistic.
I'AULMAN INVENTED
A NEW PLAY
Everyone was surprised to see
Stanford using the old suicide play
Saturday. It was one of Pop War
ner's favorites but hasn't been seen
on the Farm play list for some time.
Remember the one when Bill Paul
man went around end on a fake re
verse without any interference at
all.
I asked Tiny about that when 1
had him cornered. I asked him when
he'd decided to use that, and when
he'd had them practice it. His an
swer revealed something new about
the Indians—they don't even need to
practice a play.
"That play was invented right out
there on the field," he told me. It
originally was supposed to be a
double reverse, Grayson to Paul
man to Hamilton. But Paulman
couldn't find Bones so he went right
on around the wrong end alone —and
gained ten yards. After that they
used it again. It gained every time.
And now Stanford has another
play. Tiny's decided to put it on
the list.

TINY THORNHILL TALKS
AFTER THE GAME
Tiny Thornhill—what did he think
of Saturday's little scare? He was
in the training room when I finally
tracked him down. He sauntered
into the tub room where they were
gingerly lifting Bobby Grayson's
battered ankle out of the bath. He
shot a word—"She feel okay, Bob
by?" "Sorta painful, Tiny."
Then he talked a minute with
Bones Hamilton, who was getting
fixed up for a bad foot. Then a word
or two with Horse Reynolds about
some poor blocking. And then I
caught him.
"What d' ya think about it, Tiny?"
'liny thought plenty; and he said
what he thought. "After they got
going it was all right but right at
lirst things were pretty bad. The
linemen thought every play was go
ing to make a touchdown. They'd
stand up and watch the backfield
start, then maybe they'd do a little
half-hearted blocking."
