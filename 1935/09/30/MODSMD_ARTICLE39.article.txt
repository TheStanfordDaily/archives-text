# Practice Soccer Tilt Cancelled
## 
### 
Due to a conference ruling that I
forbids a team to hold a publicly i
announced pre-season game, the :
practice soccer tilt between Stanford
and San Jose State set for last Satur- I
day had to be cancelled. The an
nouncement of the game appeared |
in The Daily Friday and immedi- :
ately Coach Dick Bullis was ap- I
proached by conference officials and i
advised that if the game was held J
all competitors would lose a year of ;
< !igibility.
The first conference game with :
San Mateo J.C. will come in about â– 
two weeks and Bullis, with the aid j
of several seasoned men and some I
outstanding new ones is confident j
that the team awaiting the opening j
whistle will be strong although a :
few kinks will have to be ironed out !
before that time. I
