# Frosh Scrimmage Reveals Talent
## Zagar, Noll, Maino Shine In Friday Tilt First String Erratic But Reserves Perform In Better Style 
### Bob Leland 
Looking sloppy at times and slick
at others, Coach Jimmy Bradshaw's
frosh gridders went through an in
j formal scrimmage with "Husky"
Hunt's Gray squad, Friday afternoon
at the frosh field.
Needless to say, the Grays could
not penetrate the massive first-year
line, but they put over the first score
of the contest on a 30-yard pass from
Earl Hoos to Walt Chouteau and a
, 20-yard gallop to the end zone. That
was all for the Grays.
Null Sags Passes
Unfortunately most of the sloppy
playing was done by the first string.
The second team didn't look much
better, but a combination of second
and third stringers pushed over three
touchdowns in about ten minutes.
Instrumental jn the late Papoose
uprising was a fellow named W. T.
] Noll, who made a business of
j snatching passes, and business was
| good. The first score came on a
long toss to Noll, who made a nice
I catch and twisting run. The frosh
were given the ball on the Gray
1 40-yard marker. A forward-lateral
! did the trick on the first try. The
j last score came also from the 40-yard
line. A stubborn Gray defense re-
I sisted for a while, but a series of
: passes featuring Noll and Vera
Maino produced results.
First-String Starts
Coach Bradshaw started what has
i been considei'ed a "first string" con
: sisting of Don Butler and Hal
Saunders, ends; Dave Carnahan
and Pete Zagar, tackles; F. J. McMil
lan and Fred Gustafson, guards;
i Dick Sutton, center; Ed Gamier,
quarter; Pete Fay and Bill Kirsch,
| halfbacks; and Wally deWitt, full-
I back. Carnahan got a cut lip and
John West took his place.
No eulogy on the frosh would be
complete, however, without some
: mention of the activities of Zagar at
right tackle. The young behemoth
tore the Gray line to shreds and
generally raised cain. He is tall, big,
tough and a slashing type of player.
He alfto can catch passes when
shifted to the end of the line.
None of the frosh running plays
amounted to much, the timing being
bad, but the passing attack launched
by left-handed deitt, Veenker and
Huebel and received by Gamier,
Veenker, Noll, Maino, etc., looked
| like a fine weapon.
