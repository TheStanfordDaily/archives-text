# Seasoned Men Plan Return As Indian Poloists
## Practice Opens Tuesday With Six Veterans 
### 
When this season's initial polo
I practice session opens at 3 o'clock
! this afternoon, an encouraging bunch
| of seasoned material will face Cap
! tain Haydon Grubbs, Indian mentor.
Returning players of proven merit
include "Rammy" Rasmussen, Bob
Fullerton. Carl Beal, Johnny Dwyer,
Ed McKeon, and Don McAusland.
i Of these Rasmussen, Fullerton,
and Beal were regulars last year and
I are reasonably sure of copping
starting places this season, while the
other top spot will be the object of
! spirited competition from the re
, mainder until the opening game.
One source of material always
j open, recruits from which might up
i set the position of any of the regu
lars, is the frosh class. In polo, like
rugby football, a student has four
years of eligibility, and thus an in
| coming first-year man may, pro-
I vided he shows the necessary abil
| ity, step right into a varsity position.
First team players are scheduled
for practice sessions every Monday,
Wednesday, and Friday, while mem
! bers of the second and third outfits
will run through their paces on
I Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday
j mornings, Captain Grubbs de
j clared.
He plans to spend the first few
sessions getting his men and horses
, into shape, and then will further
! train the squad with intersquad
games starting Friday, October 11.
Although no definite schedule has
; been arranged as yet, the following
teams will be met by Stanford dur
j ing the season: University of Ari
zona, University of Southern Cali
fornia, Oregon State, Black Fox
Military Academy, and Pat Lin
foot's Freebooters.
In addition there will be a series
of contests with San Mateo and a
possible engagement with the Uni
; versify of Utah.
