SANTA CLARA 20
U.S.F. 7
Clipper Smith showed a great
i team, one that looks good for many
victories against weak and strong
this year. Flash Falaschi, Frisky j
KalLski, and Don Deßosa in the
backfield and an outstanding line
. were too much for the Dons, orig-
I inal hard-luck boys. Ray Petersen,
i Sal Seeno, and Mike Bacciarini
| were good in the S.F. backfield.
Santa Clara meets Washington in
! a big Coast game next Saturday, but
I far more important is the U.S.F.- |
j Card game. The Cards, iftinus Gray
i son and maybe Hamilton and
j Adams, will do well to win against
I the material Spud Lewis has on the
hilltop. Two good games.
WASHINGTON 14
| IDAHO 0
j Idaho, long a conference doormat,
j surprised the public by clamping
! much restraint upon Jimmy Phe
j lan's touted Huskies. The Vandals
I showed a dangerous and clever of
j fensive, and held the Huskies to two
1 long runs," which were long enough
: to score and give them the win.
Washington will have to come out
I of their hibernation'to cope with
Santa Clara next week at Seattle.
They didn't use any of their trick
plays Saturday, though, and may
have something with which to sur
j prise the Broncs.

An old-fashioned opening game

CAL AGGIES 0, WHITTIER 0

chids, and Mushy Pollock went well,

MONTANA 0
Troy didn't look so good last year,

the Grizzlies. With the ball under
the shadow of Montana goal posts

punch wasn't there. Sophomore

I Glenn Thompson, half, and penal

It would have been a real triumph
i had the Wolves beat St. Mary's
again, but Slip Madigan's boys won
j fairly handily.

day. It will be another one of those
I games whore everybody talks but
I you never can tell what's going to

SANTA CLARA 20
U.S.F. 7
Clipper Smith showed a great
i team, one that looks good for many
victories against weak and strong
this year. Flash Falaschi, Frisky j
KalLski, and Don Deßosa in the
backfield and an outstanding line
. were too much for the Dons, orig-
I inal hard-luck boys. Ray Petersen,
i Sal Seeno, and Mike Bacciarini
| were good in the S.F. backfield.
Santa Clara meets Washington in
! a big Coast game next Saturday, but
I far more important is the U.S.F.- |
j Card game. The Cards, iftinus Gray
i son and maybe Hamilton and
j Adams, will do well to win against
I the material Spud Lewis has on the
hilltop. Two good games.

j Idaho, long a conference doormat,

! much restraint upon Jimmy Phe
j lan's touted Huskies. The Vandals
I showed a dangerous and clever of
j fensive, and held the Huskies to two
1 long runs," which were long enough
: to score and give them the win.
Washington will have to come out
I of their hibernation'to cope with
Santa Clara next week at Seattle.
They didn't use any of their trick
plays Saturday, though, and may
have something with which to sur
