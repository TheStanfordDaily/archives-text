# Stanford Fraternities Answer Critics With a New, Intelligent Pledge Week
## 
### 
With the University of California formu
lating plans for less fearsome and less trying
Hell Weeks in the fraternities, the Houses
along Stanford's Row today advocate and pre
pare to test their new plan for a restricted,
entirely within-the-house orientation period.
Berkeley several weeks ago su lie red a near
tragedy in one of the Houses because no such
modified plan as now formulated here on the
Farm was in ell'ect. The dean of undergradu
ates at California then instituted a move to
draw up a scheme like the new Stanford one.
Drawn up and signed toward the end of
last spring quarter by the twenty-four frater
nities 011 the campus, the new Pledge Period
will attempt to get away from those "prac
tices involved" in the former Hell Week,
which had proved themselves "distinctly in
jurious to the initiate, both in health and in
scholarship."
The fraternities, furthermore, aim to rid
their organizations of those practices which
"have tended to promote internal friction

within the fraternity." As a result the Houses,
upon a vote of a majority of members within
each group, declare themselves—twenty-four
of them—entirely in accord with the plan to
eliminate the much-haggled Hell Week from
their initiation programs.
Ami so Pledge Week, the new orientation
period, stripped of its outside quests, its out
of-the-house antics, and wearisome practices,
is the Farm's intelligent answer to those crit
ics of fraternities. No longer will the pre
initiation period become a physical endurance
contest, according to the word of the twenty
four houses. No longer need the name of the
University be connected with headline-shock
ing alTairs attributed to the Greek societies.
Last week the How leaders drew up an
improved set of rushing rules. Now those
same leaders start out with a more enlight
ened, more modern orientation term known
as the Pledge Period. Stanford's Row gradu
ally adapts itself to a more fitting place in
the changing university.
