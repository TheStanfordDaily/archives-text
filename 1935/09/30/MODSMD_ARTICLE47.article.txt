# Pul-lease, Mr. Yell Leader
## 
### 
Seldom lias a tradition been so thought
lessly ignored by an A.S.S.U. ollicial as the
axe-yell tradition was flouted by the Indians'
head yell leader last Saturday.
For years, the axe was a symbol of all that
was anti Blue-and-Gold on the Farm. Appro
priately, the "Give-'em-the-axe" cry was saved
for use only against California. Gradually the
yell was extended to cover the S.C. game and
other rare occasions at the yell leader's dis
cretion.
When Stanford was in a tight spot against
•a formidable opponent, the axe-yell had a
rightful place. But for a yell-king to ask his
followers to "Give 'em the axe" in a season
opening game, with Stanford two touchdowns
ahead and on the seven-yard line driving for
another, is entirely to miss the spirit of the
famous cry.
The axe-vell is the property of generations
of Stanford men, past and future. As such,
it is a tradition, and not the yell leader's to
trifle with, even though he alone is privileged
to lead it.
A yell leader rightfully expects his rooters
lo pay respect to his pleas for no booing, to
stay and sing the hymn, and the like. The
rooting section, in return, expects its yell
leader to exercise due discretion, lo respect
Stanford's traditions.
