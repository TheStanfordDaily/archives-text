# A.S.S.U. Changes for the Better
## 
### 
Two innovations in procedure and policy
will greet Ex Committee members when they
meet under President Wally Brooke's gavel
in the current school year's opening session
Tuesday night. Both of these new policies,
which Brooke outlined in an interview last
Friday, are sound and have a definite place
in Stanford's student government code.
The first will add to the elliciency of Ex
Committee appointments. Applicants for va
cancies in the Bally Committee and other
groups named by the A.S.S.U, administrations,
in Ihe future will be required to submit writ
ten applications, staling experience. Ex Com
mittee then will approve candidates selected
on a competitive basis.
This plan will tend It) eliminate personal

factions on these committees, which accom
plish much of the investigation of condition's
and routine tasks that Ex Committee itself
could not possibly attend to, and it thereby
will generally elevate the efliciency of student
administration.
The second innovation sponsored by Brooke
was partially outlined last year, and now is
ready for launching. Student leaders will
meet bi-weekly to discuss the problems of
every phase of student government.
If this plan for round-table meetings is
properly handled, it will bring into the open
for speedy and intelligent handling many of
the differences between formerly opposing
factions of the student body. It will co-ordi
nate the Ex Committee with the student man
ager's oflice, Publications Council, Women's
Conference, Dramatic Council, and other sub
sidiary organizationsâ€”all of which brings
greater efliciency and greater co-operation
between the potential hot-beds of internal
campus strife.
So Ex Committee's new deal gets oil' lo a
good start.
