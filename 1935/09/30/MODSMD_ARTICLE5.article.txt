# Men's Council To Meet Today
## Chairman and Secretary Election Slated 
### 
Men's council, minus one of its
members, will hold its first meeting
of the year this afternoon at 1:15
o'clock in the Ex Committee rooms.
Purpose of the meeting will be to
elect a permanent chairman and sec
retary, to make plans for the year,
and to discuss the first duty of the
body this fall, that of instructing the
freshmen in the intricacies of the
Honor Code, it was announced.
The committee will also consider
the campus traffic problem which
falls to it. "Gordy" Davis, cam
pus patrolman, has been merely
warning speedsters this first week,
but will now embark on his cam
paign of pinning tags on speedy
drivers for which they must re
port to the Men's Council.
The missing member of the coun
cil is Henry Laws, who is not re
turning to school this fall. His posi
tion will be filled in the special
A.S.S.U. election to be held some
time next week.
Bob Gros, sole returning member
who has served on the council pre
viously, will be acting chairman of
the meeting.
