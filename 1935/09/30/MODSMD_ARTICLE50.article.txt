The first Sunday night supper of the 1935-36 season
was hold with appropriate ceremonies last night, bring
ing in its wake the attendant evils for hashers, inno
cent men, and children. For information of innocent
and innocuous frosh, who have yet to learn of the
more insidious evils of college life, I say frankly and
simply that the Sunday night supper is an institution
of the devil himself.
To which the Right Reverend Wong, purveyor to
fastidious appetites, appends: "Sunday night supper,
vclly bum." (which, after all, sums up the whole
business.
It is reported that one of the sorority women
phoned up a Phi Delt one bright Sunday afternoon,
and asked him to attend the festivities at her house
that evening. His reply was: "No thanks, I've already
seen the show." •
Common reaction to the President's Reception Sat
urday night is that the freshman women are "terrific."
What they were terrific about is not reported. One
of Our Hasher's outposts relays the news that this
noveau intelligentsia is just the old 500 multiplied by
two. This results in the formula: frigidity equals stu
pidity. Well, more material for the LID and the Walrus
Club, and less for the "distressed hotel-keepers" and
more-distressed patrons. Conditions may get so bad
that students will start coming to college to get an
education.
The Stanford Injuns got a liberal education during
the first half of their light scrimmage against the San
Jose Teachers.
It is said that members of the great freshman team
had to take interpreters along to the receptions. Hitler
would have a hard time asserting the Nordic myth, if
he ever saw a "100 per cent" American football team.
As for Schmeling's fighting Joe Louis, My! My! In all
his career of boxing, it is reported, Louis has never
suffered a black eye—or a sunburn.
There is no truth in the report that the drummer in
the Stanford band takes a work-out every night in
Encina at 2 a.m.
Love is just a roller coaster—without the rollers.
I apologize for all ot it. I am unwell.
