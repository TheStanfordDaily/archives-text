## AN APOLOGY FOR THE COLLEGE MAN 
### 
"You can tell a Stanford man a mile off . . . he's so
self-centered . . . conceited . . . wrapped up in his own
affairs ... an exaggerated individualist."
♦ ♦ ♦ ♦
That indictment has been fired at members of the
student body time and again. The charge is made
against those who go to other colleges, too, and very
often it comes from within the walls. Someone, per
haps a newcomer, can't reconcile himself to the fact
that everyone seems to be so busy with his own affairs
that he has no time to give to others.
In the first place, such a concept of college persons
isn't wholly justified. Always there are a certain num
ber who couldn't possibly be intelligent or industrious
enough to always have something to do. The sight of
someone with time on his hands isn't unusual. And
that kind is usually too care-free, amiable, and demo
cratic to be called individualistic or self-centered.

That a part of the charge is justified can't be denied.
But when a college man has his own lessons to learn,
his own reputation to make as an activity man or
athlete, his own college and fraternity or eating club
to be loyal to, his own girl, perhaps, and his own car,
how could he help but appear to be an individualist.
With so many interests, he is extremely busy, and thus
seems to be wrapped up in his own affairs. And so,
with his course of activity so shaped, he tends to
talk about himself and his doings, and thus receives
the charge of being conceited.

Suppose this group of nearly 4000 students weren't
individualists—suppose they didn't attend strictly to
their own affairs but spent a great deal of time dis
playing interest in the business of their fellows. If
such were the case, Stanford would make a glorious
Rotary club, but a poor university.
Even though a university is made up in the main
of distinctly separate personalities, we all know that
those individuals do not surround ihemselves with
cold shells of unfriendliness. Gemeingeist unter freien
Geistern, the Germans say; comradery among free
spirits.

And as for the college man being conceited, an an
swer to that is found in the words of a great former
college president who said, "I know that the conceit
and flippancy of the college student is proverbial. But
you will find that the conceit of the college student who
knows something, if not much, is a very little thing
beside the conceit of a man who knows nothing at. all."
—John McClelland
