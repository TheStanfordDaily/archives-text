# "PROMISE NOT TO DEFACE"

### 
j The Editor, Sir:
Two hours in the library with
, nothing but frustration to show for
; it. I have been trying to summarize
| a chapter on political parties. And
I what happened? Some previous
reader had underlined with red ink;
j another used red pencil; another,
j blue ink; another, lead pencil; while
one still more ingenious person had
skipped about with black ink, draw
j ing lines to connect sentences un
! derlined with other colors.
One found three points, another
five, and these were numbered in
I arabic and Roman styles. Marginal
| comments, both obvious and mis
) taken, were evident in green and
j purple. You should see my sum
| mary of that chapter! The author
! of the volume would scream and, I
am afraid, so would the professor.
"Just a poor bewildered graduate
j student,"
