# CHEERS, THEN BOUNCED

### 
; The Editor, Sir:
As far as I can make out it has
! long been the custom at Stanford to
boo and hiss the villain of a picture
j at the local theaters. And for that,
I certainly can appreciate being
j thrown out, but for applauding at an

! opportune moment and THEN get
; ting thrown out —well, that is a
j little too much.
It seems as though the people of
| Palo Alto are complaining about the
j racket during the shows. They say
| they can't hear. As a general rule
: we don't make a great deal of noise
I unless the picture waiTants it. When
] the show is worth seeing, we enjoy
j it and let others around us enjoy it,
' but when the picture becomes a
horribly distorted brain-child of a
half-crazed movie producer, we feel
| it our duty to amuse the people
J around us with local talent instead
of subjecting them to such horrible
torture as they should experience
upon viewing what some nuts would
call a movie.
But my main gripe is the'fact that
I was thrown out of the theater for
applauding the Stanford varsity
; football team during practice, as
| seen by the news-reel!
Sincerely, P.A.M.
Point well taken, but no men
tion of the quality or quantity of
said applause.—Ed.
