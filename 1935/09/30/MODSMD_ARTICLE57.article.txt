"CALL OF THE WILD"
At the Fox-Stanford
B Unusual scenic shots, the |
usual Clark Gable, and a pass
able stoi'y all go to make up
an evening of worth-while
[ entertainment in "Call of the Wild."
But Jack Oakie, who finds his best
1 comedy role to date, and Buck, the
dog, walk away with the show.
Alaskan wilderness both slowed
down the story and provided a back- '
ground that surpasses anything done
recently. Even the faked shots were ;
well done. One thing that will puz
zle fans, as it has puzzled every j
critic since release of the picture, j
was Loretta Young's perfect coiffure
I in the middle of an Arctic blizzard. J
That, however, is a minor detail.
The picture is definitely worth see
i ing-
A fair cartoon and better-than
average March of Time round out
the program. And one interesting !
note is the applause given Haile !
Selassie and the hearty boos with
which the audience greeted Musso- i
lini.
