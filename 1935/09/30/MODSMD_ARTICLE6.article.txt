# Second Pamphlet In Photolith Series Comes Off Press
## 
### 
Just off the Stanford University
Press is "The Hoover War Library"
by Neill C. Wilson, the second of a
series of brochures published by the
Stanford Associates in photolith
form after appearing originally as a
supplement in the Stanford Illus
trated Review.
The scries is meant to tell the
story of the various schools and de
partments in the University, and the
pamphlets are attractively illus
trated with some finest photolith
work yet turned out by the Stanford
Press.
"Harnessing High Voltage," the
first of the scries, told the story of
the Ryan Laboratory, which it said
was responsible in no small part for
man's twenty-fold increase in ability
to transport high voltage and which
has been used extensively in solving
the problems of transporting the
Boulder Dam power into Los An
geles.
