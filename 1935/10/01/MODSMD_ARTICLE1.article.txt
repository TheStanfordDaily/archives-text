# Hamilton May Be Ready For S.F.U. Battle
## Grayson's Injury May Be Healed in Time For Bruin Game Doubts Adams' Start Coffis, Black, Vigna Gain First Team Posts 
### 
In the hospital yesterday were
Bobby Grayson, Bones Hamilton,
and Woody Adams.
In Tiny Thornhill's first-string
line-up were Jimmy Coffis, Joe
Vigna, and Bob Black.
Thre three last mentioned earned
jobs on the new red machine, now
buildt for both land and air pur
poses, by their successful chores in
the second half against San Jose
Saturday.
Going hack to the injured,*
though, yesterday's developments
were optimistic. Adams, he of the
game Achilles tendon, is just about
all right and if things stay in the
same happy groove all week lie
will start Saturday against the
U.S.F. I)ons.
Hamilton, too, is figured to be
shooed out of the hospital today, and
doctors give him a 50-50 chance of
playing Saturday. Bones personally
says he'll play. With Grayson out
and Bones ready, it may give the
stocky all-American a shot at the
key fullback job.
Grayson Out
Grayson, who proved himself the
same old spark plug against the
Spartans, will not get a crack at the
Dons, but the chance remains that if
lie is needed he may be ready to
take a shot at U.C.L.A. the next
week. He, too, is supposed to come
out of the hospital soon, on crutches,
though.
Keith Topping, the missing end,
did not get into a suit yesterday,
and probably won't he able to un
til the pain abates from behind his
left shoulder blade, where the rib
cracked.
Back in suits, offsetting the injur
ies, were Alex Trompas, steady little
end, and Fred Williams, the sprint
ing halfback and '37 frosh star. Both
ran through signals and looked none
the worse for their respective lay
offs.
