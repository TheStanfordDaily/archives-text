### 
William Murray Timmons, direc
tor of dramatics, was stricken with
appendicitis at his home in Palo Alto
last night and operated on this
morning at the Paio Alto Hospital
on the campus, where he is now re
cuperating. Mr. Timmons' progress
is reported as satisfactory by nurses
at the hospital, where it is expected
| that he will be in the hospital about
two weeks.
The possibility that fall quarter's
j first dramatic production may be
j held up because of the director's illâ€”
j ness was scouted last night by Rex
i Hardy, dramatic manager, and mem
i bers of the Dramatics Council. Phil
| Brown, technical assistant to Tim
| mons, said, "Someone else may have
I to choose the cast for the first play,
I but unless something entirely un
i expected happens to mar Mr. Tim -
mons' recovery he will be able to
direct the actual production."
