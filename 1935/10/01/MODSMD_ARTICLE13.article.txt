# Bassett Speaks On U.S. Diction
## English Professor Heard Over Stanford Hour 
### 
"It is as pi'esumptuous as it is j
futile for the advocates of the speech j
of any section to attempt to impose
that pi-onunciation on the rest of
the country, yet no one will dispute
the right of the inhabitants of any
locality to speak as they please."
This statement das made by Profes
sor Lee Emei'son Bassett, professor j
of English, in his speech "Is Thex'e a j
Standard Pronunciation?" over the j
Stanford Radio Hour last night.
In pointing out the distinctions of i
a good American pronunciation
Professor Bassett added that free- ;
dom from marked px-ovincialisms, |
the sounding of vowels, and conco
nants properly formed and sounded
are general characteristics. "People j
do not say cous-in, hea-ven, grav
el, nor pup-il as did a certain teach
er of elocution whom I knew," he i
said.
In conclusion Professor Bassett j
stated: "It is safe to say that while
there is no absolute ideal standard
of pronunciation, thex*e is a style of
diction understood and accepted as
good anywhere in the country."
