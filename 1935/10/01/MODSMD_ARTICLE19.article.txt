# Local Boys Travel Down Amazon River in Canoe
## 
### BARBARA SWEET 
Down the Amazon in a canoe,
dream of most adventure-thirsty
boys, became a reality to three local
youths last winter when they were
fortunate enoug hto travel from Peru
to Para, Brazil, upon this famous and
romantic river. Included in the party
were Ed Strong, Stanford junior.
Gain John, freshman, and Arthur
Post of Palo Alto.
The trip started inauspiciously.
1 After traveling by steerage to Mol
i Peru, the adventurers went to Cuzco,
i Peru, the adevntifrers went to Cuzco,
three days insland, only to discover
that they h;td arrived at the wrong
time of year to make their trip
down the river. This misunder
standing resulted in a three months'
I delay, while the party waited for the
' jungle rainy season. During their
enforced stay, the boys investigated
I the Inca ruins, hunted deer, and
I even had an encounter with a tiger.
When the rainy season set in, th?
i actual trip was begun. After going
100 miles by mule along tjie bank of
I the river, which is impassable at this
i point, the travelers borrowed a ca

noc at. the last point of civilization, a
finca (ranch), hired six Indians to go
with them, and started down the
stream.
Five days later they sent the In
dians back with the canoe and bor
rowed a second dugout from a white
man who had killed his father and
was living in the jungle as a fugi
tive from justice. They then made,-
portage around an impassable placc
in the river, Pongo do Mainque
(Gorge of the Bear). The rest of
the trip the adventurers made alone,
cutting their way through the jungle
with two machetes, during which
time several of the party came down
with malaria. The journey was con
cluded by river barge, 14 days down
to Para.
Asked whether he would advise
other students to make this trip, Ed
Strong replied: "The actual trip it
self is worth-while. It makes a fine
camping tour. But getting to South
America, getting provisions, and get
ting over the "manana" spirit of the
southern countries is difficult and
detracts from the value of the en
terprise."

1 After traveling by steerage to Mol
i Peru, the adventurers went to Cuzco,
i Peru, the adevntifrers went to Cuzco,
three days insland, only to discover
that they h;td arrived at the wrong
time of year to make their trip
down the river. This misunder
standing resulted in a three months'
I delay, while the party waited for the
' jungle rainy season. During their
enforced stay, the boys investigated
I the Inca ruins, hunted deer, and
I even had an encounter with a tiger.
When the rainy season set in, th?
i actual trip was begun. After going
100 miles by mule along tjie bank of
I the river, which is impassable at this
i point, the travelers borrowed a ca

noc at. the last point of civilization, a
finca (ranch), hired six Indians to go
with them, and started down the
stream.
Five days later they sent the In
dians back with the canoe and bor
rowed a second dugout from a white
man who had killed his father and
was living in the jungle as a fugi
tive from justice. They then made,-
portage around an impassable placc
in the river, Pongo do Mainque
(Gorge of the Bear). The rest of
the trip the adventurers made alone,
cutting their way through the jungle
with two machetes, during which
time several of the party came down
with malaria. The journey was con
cluded by river barge, 14 days down
to Para.
Asked whether he would advise
other students to make this trip, Ed
Strong replied: "The actual trip it
self is worth-while. It makes a fine
camping tour. But getting to South
America, getting provisions, and get
ting over the "manana" spirit of the
southern countries is difficult and
detracts from the value of the en
terprise."
