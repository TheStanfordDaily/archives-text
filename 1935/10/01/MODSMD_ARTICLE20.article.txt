# Gros Named As Head of Men's Board
## Council Warns of Strict Traffic Regulations Seedy Secretary 
### 
Men's Council adjourned its first ;
meeting of the year yesterday after |
electing two new officers and dis- !
cussing potent Honor Code and traf
fic problems. Bob Gros, student j
manager, was made chairman, and
George Leedy was elected secretary. |
An entirely new plan for bringing j
the Honor Code to new students' at
tention will be inaugurated this j
quarter. One or two evenings in the !
near future will feature freshman |
mass meetings in the Assembly Hali j
at which the council will explain the j
workings of the Code.
Will Break Up
Immediately after the assemblies
the students will break up into
small groups each headed by a coun
cil member to discuss the Code in
formally and to clear up any mis
understandings.
Traffic problems vexing the coun
cil received special attention. The
ruling that no parking is permitted
in front of and directly across from
the post office will be strictly en
forced. The fine for such violation,
now one dollar, will be increased,
Gros warned, if the ruling is not re
spected.
Speed limit along Lasuen Street,
the Row, is set at 20 miles per hour
and 15 at intersections. Violators of
this and arterial stop rulings will be
severely fined. Only in this way,
believes the council, will accidents
be prevented.
No Radical Changes
In a statement made for himself
and the council Gros explained:
"We contemplate no radical changes
nor spectacular program this year.
We like to think of such a body as
the Men's Council being above bal
lyhoo, publicity, and necessity for
propaganda methods.
"It is no pleasant job to sit in
judgment on your fellow students,"
the new chairman concluded, "but
the Honor Code is our main concern
and we intend to enforce it unequiv
ocally and fairly."
One vacant position on the coun
cil will be filled at a later date.
