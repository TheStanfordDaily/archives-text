# Possible Saving On Theater Told
## Gros Explains Budgeting Of Construction Costs 
### 
The fact that $15,000 may be saved
on new theater construction costs,
which means that the proposed $50,-
000 addition will mean a boost of
only $35,000 in expenses, was ex
plained yesterday by Student Man
ager Bob Gros.
A lump sum of $325,000 has al
ready been borrowed and approved
by the Board of Trustees. The addi -
tional sum under discussion at to
night's Ex Committee meeting
would raise the total loan to $360,000
if sanctioned.
As this amount would be diverted
from other University investments,
5 per cent interest is required. The
saving is due to the fact that the
Union dollar per student per quarter
can now be turned over to the the
ater fund each quarter instead of
once a year as planned, making pos
sible more rapid payment, and thus
cutting interest costs.
Actual time now required for pay
ment, says Gros, is about 20 years.
If Ex Committee okays the second
sum it will be approximately 20
years and seven months before the
theater is completely out of debt.
