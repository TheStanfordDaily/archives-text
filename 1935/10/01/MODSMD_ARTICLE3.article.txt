### 
With 75 tryoutees at the first
meeting yesterday afternoon,
the two-week trial period for
Daily stafl positions has begun.
Any students who failed to
attend the first meeting and are
interested in feature writing,
sports, interviewing, or straight
news work may attend the
meeting tmoorrow afternoon at
5 o'clock in the Journalism
Library.
At the close of the two-week
tryout period on October 14 the
successful neophytes will be
announced as reporters on the
Daily staff.
Due to the losses through
graduation and failure to re
turn to school of former staff
members, an unusually large
number of reporters, both men
and women, will be taken.
An intensive training sched
ule has been made out to ac
quaint the tryoutees with Daily
style and the duties of the reg
ular staff members.
