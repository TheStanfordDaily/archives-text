# 'Lame Duck' Foes Hit By Sen. Norris
## Colleagues' Grumblings Lead to Statement By Nebraskan 
### 
WASHINGTON, Sept. 30 UP). — 1
Senator Norris defended today the
new style lume-duckless Congress
against recent grumbling by some of
his colleagues.
One, for example, had said about '
all that was accomplished under the j
Nebraskan's amendment to the (
Constitution convening Congress
every January 3 without any limit j
on the length of the session was to
do away with the Christmas con- j
gressional recess.
Formerly Congress met the first
Monday in December, and its second
session had to end by March 4. Also, |
members elected in November did
not actually sit until Decerrfber a
year later; whereas now they take
their seats within little more than a j
month.
Although the new plan was not
involved in winding up the recent j
session, some have cited the late 1
Louisianan's last hours.
