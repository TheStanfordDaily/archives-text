# France Pledges Aid To England if Italy Attacks
## 
### 
PARIS, Sept. 30 (JP). â€”An official
spokesman said tonight "France
would be forced to aid Great Britain
if Italy attacked her fleet while it
was enforcing League of Nations
sanctions."
There was no definite confirma
tion of the report Great Britain has
asked for an expression of France's
attitude in the event Italy should,
without provocation, attack the Brit
ish fleet in the Mediterranean.
But one authority stated "'specific
questions" have been asked by Great
Britain regarding France's action "in
specific cases that might arise" in
connection with application of
League of Nations sanctions.
Some infox - med observers saw in
dications the eventuality of a sea
attack might be part of a mutual
assistance agreement reported under
discussion by France and Great
Britain.
In any event, officials said, France
would automatically be obliged, un
der the League covenant, to take
sanctions against Italy if Italy made
an "unprovoked attack" on Great
Britain while the latter was carry
ing out League orders.
Yet French unwillingness to make
definite promises to Great Britain
unless that nation reciprocates was
reflected in authoritative quarters
and in the press.
A French promise "in principle"
to stick by the League even if it
involves sanctions was expected in
some quarters.
The cabinet will tackle the prob
lem at its next meeting, probably
Wednesday, even if the ministers
answer in the affirmative. Premier
Laval was expected to point out to
Great Britain that severe measures
might drive Mussolini into the arms
of Adolf Hitler.
