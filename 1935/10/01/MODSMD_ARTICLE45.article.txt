HISTORY REPEATS
ON STANFORD GRID
Stanford football history repeats
itself.
Eighteen days less than a year ago
the following words were printed in
the Daily. With a few exceptions the
•same words could be reprinted today
and aptly describe the situation that
faces Stanford's 1835 grid machine.
This is what sports editor Millard
Browne said just before the U.S.F.
game last year.
"The Dons will find a Cardinal
team more vitally weakened by in
juries than any other Stanford op
position has to date this season. The
sick list is not long, but it strikes
just at the wrong spots. It hits right
end and claims Keith Topping
which will mean that probably Car
los Monsalve will start . . ."
And then, almost as though it
were written by some super-seer
the column continues:
"Then it took its toll at left guard
by grabbing Woody Adams, behind
whom is Bob Black. And behind
Black there is little of varsity cal
ibre.
"It took a big bite at right half
back where it claimed Gordon
Head, and took partial claim on
'•ones Hamilton. The latter will be
ready to play but he will not be used
in more than half of the game, and
even during the time he is in, he
may have to assist Bobby Grayson,
another partial cripple, with the
fullback duties."
Yes, it's a real coincidence. But
this year we haven't the good for
tune to refer to Bobby Grayson as a
partial cripple, nor can we count
fully on the services of Bones Ham
ilton Saturday.
And that, along with half a dozen
other reasons, leads us to believe
that University of San Francisco is
going to be a mighty tough custo
mer for the Indians. That will be
discussed profusely as the week-end
draws near.
CAB CALLAWAY
COMES BACK
It's good to see Claude Callaway
back on the Farm. This time it's not
the Cab that we knew as varsity
tackle last year but just Claude
Calloway, a Stanford student.
Doctor's orders will keep Cab off
the grid all this season so he's plan
ning to spend a lot of time with the
books. Those who know him and
those who scan the bawlout occa
sionally know that Callaway's
achievements weren't all made on
the football turf.
Cab expects to spend a lot of
time around the practice lot this sea
son —he couldn't stay away if he
tried—and give his health a chance
to reach the top again after that
acute case of asthma and bronchial
pneumonia that claimed him last
spring.
But when next football season
comes Cab will be back in shape
and if all goes well, he hopes to be
back clearing that hole through
right tackle. —Frost
