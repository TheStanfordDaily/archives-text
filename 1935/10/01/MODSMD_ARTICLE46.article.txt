concerning the chances of his 193G
edition of the Stanford tennis squad
against California and University of
Southern California, whom he con
siders chief threats to the contin
uance of last year's Indian raquet
.supremacy.
Opening practice for the season,
which does not officially commence
until the end of winter quarter,
Lockwood has four returning letter
men bolstered by two outstanding
players graduated from the 1935
freshman outfit.
Captain John Law, whose tennis
has improved considerably because
of added court-covering ability fa
cilitated through the loss of 15
pounds excess weight, now stacks up
as the logical number one man, fol
lowed in order by Bill Seward, Ben
Dey, Bobby Underwood, Bob Pom
mel", and Bob Braley. Underwood
and Braley, promising sophomores,
might easily advance their rankings
before spring, and any of the men
have a good chance of replacing Law
n the coveted first spot by that
time.
