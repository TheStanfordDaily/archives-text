# Shoots Own Hands, Collects Insurance
## 
### 
PORTLAND. Ore., Sept. 30 (/P).â€”
Ruling that it is immaterial whether
George Hay du Barry of Seattle and
Gold Beach did or did not deliber
ately shoot away both his hands,
Federal Judge John H. McNary held
today that he still is entitled to col
lect disability insurance benefits.
The insurance company had sued
to cancel Du Barry's $12,500 policy.
The company insisted the injury
was self-inflicted solely to collect on
the insurance at the rate of $125 a
month for life.
