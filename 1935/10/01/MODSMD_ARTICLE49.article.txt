# Water Polo Team Victor Over Athens
## Varsity Ragged; Whips Clubmen, 3-2 In League Tilt 
### 
Stanford's water polo team started I
| its conference season off in a slight- j
!ly ragged yet wholly encouraging
i manner last night when it defeated j
the Athens Club in Oakland, 3 to 2.
j The game, an opener for both teams 1
!in the Northern California Water ,
Polo League, was played at Oakland. '
Charles Giffin opened the Stan
i ford scoring with a goal in the first
i half, and Hen Voss and Wally
Wiget each climaxed brilliant of- |
i fensive drives with a goal later in
the game. The Indians began to
| roll smoothly late in the game and
j scored another tally that was not
| counted just as the final gun
| sounded.
The game resolved into a fast of-
I fensive battle from the start, with
I the ball traveling from one end of j
j the pool to the other in rapid sue- '
I cession. Several players on both
teams were ordered out of the tank
for over-rough tactics.
Bob Haslacher's goal tending I
staved off several well-directed |
Athens thrusts, and the play of Voss ;
and Giffin at forward was outstand- j
ing. Other starters for Stanford in- ;
eluded Bob Hoover, sprint; Bill j
Woodard, centerbaek; and Wiget |
and Bob Sutherland, guards.
With but a week of seasoning be- !
hind them, the frosh lost a prelim- j
inary to the thens reserves, 5 to 3. I
Coach Nort Thornton commented
thai he was "well pleased" with the
early season showing of his yearling !
t^ain.
