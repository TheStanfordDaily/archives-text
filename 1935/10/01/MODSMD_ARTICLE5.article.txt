# Gaieties Offer Varied Talent
## 
### 
An exceptionally fine array of
talent is promised for the 1935 Gaie
ties, according to Winstead Weaver,
president of Ram's Head Society,
which sponsors the show. Such old
stand-bys as Jim Copp, Dick Daw
son, Nancy Scoggins, Gordon Heche,
Pete Knccht, and Weaver hifnself
will appear.
Foremost among the new stars is
Dudley Nix, author of "So Lovely
and So Sweet," who before his en
i-ollment at Stanford was with Tom
Coakley's orchestra. Nix has con
tributed new music for the Gaieties.
In addition, there are several junior
transfers who have previous stage
successes to their credit.
Continuity has been planned for
the whole show by Weaver and Wil
liam Timmons, dramatic adviser.
One of the features will be an orig
inal political skit in which Weaver
will impersonate Mussolini, Raspu
tin, Roosevelt, and Moses.
