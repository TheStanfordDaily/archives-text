With over 50 men out for the soc
cer team, Coach Dick Bullis is look
ing forward confidently to the open
ing of the season in about two w£eks
against San Mateo J.C.
Although he expressed a little
doubt as to the strength of the for
ward line, he expects to be able to
iron out this difficulty before game
time and with the stellar playing of
Captain Barney Vierling at fullback,
John McClelland, a three-year man,
at the goal position, and Dick Hanna
and Bob Hall at the halfback spots,
the team that awaits the opening
whistle of the San Mateo tilt should
be very good. Hanna is a new man
in Stanford soccer circles and has
showed lots of promise in early sea
son competition.
Eight conference games are on the
schedule for the team this season
and a possibility that they may meet
U.C.L.A. later. Besides two games
with San Mateo, they will engage in
a pair of contests each with S.F.U.,
San Jose State and California.
In contrast to the lax-ge turnout
for the varsity, only 11 men have
reported so far for the frosh squad.
However, Bullis expects more to
come out in the next few days so
that they may at least be able to put
a team on the field for the first
game.
