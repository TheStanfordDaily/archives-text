Lon Warneke, left, one of the aces on the Chicago pitching staff, who
was greatly instrumental in bringing the National League title to the
Cubs, will probably face Tommy Bridges, big siege gun for the Detroit
Tigers, in the opening game of the 1935 World Series. The Tigers are
scheduled to go into the fray on the long end of the odds. (Associated
