# 'Student Grid Days' Inaugurated Today
## 
### 
"Today's the day we look our j
best," sing Tiny Thornhill's Indians, j
for this afternoon at 4 o'clock begins |
the series of "Student's Days" at the j
practice field announced last week j
by Yell Leader Dick Stark.
Originally announced as a scrim- j
mage, today's "official" practice will j
consist of line drills and speeding up i
the famous Stanford charge. The 1
plan for a scrimmage was dropped
by Thornhill because of injuries
keeping some of the squad's stars off i
the field. Stark and his assistants, j
Webb Jones and Tal Shelton, will
lead yells and with the help of the j
managers give fans a few pointers j
on the Indian style of play.
