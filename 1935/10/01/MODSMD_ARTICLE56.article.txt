# Papoose Coach Orders Tough Drill for Team
## 
### 
Not entirely satisfied with the
. showing of his charges in Friday's
scrimmage with the Greys, Coach
Jimmy Bradshaw has ordered
scrimmage for Wednesday. Lots of
hard work on the dummies is also
in store for the yearling gridders
before they tackle Sacramento Sat
! urday.
New faces are likely to appear in
' the line-up prior to the Jaysee con
! test as Bradshaw strives to find the
j right combination. It now appears
| that the added weight of Fred Gus
| tafson will get him the call over Bob
Shreve at one tackle post.
Harry Huebel may break into one
of the halfback spots as his steadi
ness under fire has caused Bradshaw
i to favor him over either Pete Fay
or Louis Veenker.
j Saturday's probable starting line-up
i is: Butler and Saunders, ends;
Zagar and Carnahan, tackles; Mt
; Millan and Gustafson, guards; Sut
| ton, center; Gamier, quarter; Huebel
! and Kirsch, halves; and deWitt, full.
