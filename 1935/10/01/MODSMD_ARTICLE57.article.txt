## Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily Member of the Associated Press Stanford's "Greatest" Team Deserves A Chance to Prove Point to Country 
### 
The feasibility and possibility of the Board
of Athletic Control's scheduling some form
of intcrsectional football game is brought up
for consideration in a contribution to today's
"Vox Campi" column.
This is the year, the student contributor
believes, when Stanford should schedule one
of the formidable teams of the Middle West
or East, since even if Stanford goes through
her schedule undefeated she will have no na
tional title to show for it. He also points out
that the Indian team, made up mostly of
seniors who have worked together to organ
ize Stanford football into one of the most
potent units in the country, deserve a trip east
during their last season. *
The B.A.C. agrees so thoroughly with this
stand that it has been working overtime since
schedule-making last winter in trying to get
an intcrsectional game that has drawing
power. Many of the schools contacted say
"Fine —next year."
13y now every major football team in the
East or Middle West, except those excluded
anyway by conference agreements, has al
ready tilled the only dates available to Stan
ford for an Eastern game—Thanksgiving Day
or the following Saturday, November 30. I)e

cember 7 is out of the question, since the
players could not get hack to the Farm in
time lor final examinations.
That leaves only the possibility of a home
game on December 7. Notwithstanding the
fact that a game here would be nearly as
lucrative as one in New York or Chicago, the
B.A.C. management has been only lukewarm
over a post-season contest in the local sta
dium, because the team itself is not overly
anxious to play any more games at home.
The Indians ask, and rightfully, for a chance
to go visiting.
However, since the trip seems out of the
question, it would be directly to the team's
advantage to play, and beat, a major Eastern
eleven, in order to give those who pick a "na
tional champion" some comparative score on
which to base their calculations.
Stanford could beat every team on her pres
ent schedule and still not rank among the.
leaders of the game, for the obvious reason
that none of the squads she plays gives evi
dence of figuring very high in the national
ratings. Therefore, the Indian team should
welcome a chance to prove its abilities in this,
possibly its greatest year, to the skeptical
East.
