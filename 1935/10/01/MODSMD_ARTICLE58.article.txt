# Not to Grant the Request Would Be Folly
## 
### 
Culmination of a several years' drive and
amassing of ideas for Stanford's much-publi
cized and long-awaited Memorial Theater is
the plan which goes before the Ex Committee
tonight for final acceptance and for the addi
tional financial backing necessary to insure
[lie starting of construction on the building
by the first of the year.
The reason for this request for thirty-five
thousand dollars lies in the change of plans
to meet the rise in costs and the expense of
a change in the type of structure deemed
necessary for safety in a country troubled by
earthquakes.
Not to grant the needed sum, which will be
paid oil' over a period of twenty years with a
twelve-dollar tax on the average student to
be distributed over four years, one dollar a
quarter, would be disastrous to the accepted
plans for the structure. To quibble about pre
vious student body voting on the question is
to defeat that which has already been ac
complished.
Not to okeh the request now, therefore,
with three hundred and twenty-five thousand
dollars previously awarded, would be folly,
since no one party will benefit more by the
building of the proposed theater than the
students, represented by the Ex Committee
tonight.
