Apropos were the remarks of Dr. Wilbur
in church Sunday. At a time when the coun
try as a whole, and colleges in particular, are
drifting away from the mollifying effects of
religion, and from the "fundamental stand
ards" of character and morals, it was singu
larly filling that he should quote Mrs. Stan
ford's hy-no-means-uncertain views on the
subject.
Two decades ago, Mrs. Stanford said to Dr.
Brainier, famed geologist and second Presi
dent of the University: "That is why 1 am so
much more interested in the church on the
campus than I am in your precious rocks. For
no amount of learning can lake the place of de
cency, and no amount of .science can lake the
place of backbone.
"And as the moral and spiritual life is
more important than the life of our bodies,

so moral and spiritual instruction is more
important to young people than instruction
of any other kind. That is why I think the
church should be the heart and center of
this University
"And that is why I said that while my
heart is in the University my soul is in the
church. Take away the moral and spiritual
from higher education and I want nothing to
do with this or any other university.
"I don't mean that students require in
struction in doctrines; that is just what I do
not mean; and it was for this very reason
that I wanted the church to be and remain
non-sectarian
"Like any other force, education needs in
telligent guidance if it is to serve any good
purpose. And where shall we look for such
guidance if we look not to the sound and
unselfish principles taught by Christianity?"
At the time, Dr. Branner appended:
"To Mrs. Stanford, the church stood for
high-miiuledness, uprightness, unselfishness,
and for what are generally known as the
Christian virtues, and it was as the teacher
of those virtues that she wanted to pass it and
its influence on to the members of this com
munity, living and yet to come."
Thanks are in order to Dr. Wilbur for
calling these purposes of Mrs. Stanford to our
mind. Suggestions are in order to the student
body to read and mull over the same, and
profit thereby.
Further in order is the act of pausing in
the hurly-burly whirl long enough to go to
Mrs. Stanford's inspiring church some Sun
day for a little quiet reflection.
