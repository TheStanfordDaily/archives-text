Unlike the inmates at Alcatraz, and more like
A.F.L. men, Stanford women are bothered frequently
by lock-outs—or had you heard?
Late Saturday night, in fact very late Saturday
night, in one of those quaint old sorority houses that
commands a dominant view of Stanford's tree-lined
Row, a certain lady upon finding herself arriving home
at a late hour discovered by circumstantial evidence,
such as keys, etc., that another lady was yet to arrive
from San Francisco, the Skyline, Governor's Lane, and
way points.
So she made out the tardiest one's lock-out slip,
and when she came to the part where it asks for the
reason for the lock-out, the less-tardy raised up her
eyes to heaven and discovered she could not lie, even
for a sister. Simply and plainly, she wrote the word:
"Passion."
During summer quarter, difficulty is frequently had
with the older students who do not realize Stanford s
double-trouble 2:30 standard of morals. One such was
a middle-aged school teacher who flagrantly flaunted
the powers that beef, by consistently and violently
disobeying Stanford's 2:30 stepping-stone to success.
When the authorities finally caught up with the
middle-aged school teacher they dragged her before
the bar of justice and began to operate.
Authorities: "You understand the principles of the
lock-out?"
Old Maid: "Yes."
Authorities: "You have received seven lock-outs
in the past week?"
Old Maid: "Yes."
Authorities: "Do you have any explanation?"
Old Maid: "Yes. I was busy getting engaged."
