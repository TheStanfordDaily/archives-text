# An Air-Minded Campus
## 
### 
From the president of the National Inter
collegiate Flying Club comes word that Stan
ford ranks as the most air-minded school in
the country. Sixty-two Farm students did
more living id an aviation school in Palo Alto
during the last school year than any other col
legiate group on record.
The fourteen hundred living hours hung up
by the aerially inclined students were charac
terized :is "being in a class by themselves."
Vet those sixty-two enthusiasts had to
amble over to a nearby Hying field to pursue
their interests because Stanford, usually far
in advance of other institutions in facilities,
had not gone ahead and established a school
of aviation when the University was so well
located for such an undertaking in the coining
field of transportation.
