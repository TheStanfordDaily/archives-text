# A 						POST-SEASON GAME?

### 
The Editor, Sir:
Saturday marked the opening of
what we all hope will be the most
successful football season for our
great team—a bunch of fellows who
began together four years ago as
freshmen, and who, with the addi
tion of a few newcomers, have made
football history on the coast.
For most of th« players on the
team, this marks their last year in
competition at Stanford . . . those
who have not had the opportunity of
knowing them personally appreciate
what they have done for the school.
It is the last year for most of the
fellows. Yet the Board of Athletic
Control has given them one of the
poorest football schedules anyone
