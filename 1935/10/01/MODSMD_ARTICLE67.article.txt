# Walrus Club Meets Today at 4 o'clock
## 
### 
Only organized forum and discus
sion group of Stanford, the Walrus
Club, meets for the first time this
year at 4 o'clock today in the Y.W.
C.A. rooms upstairs in the Women's
Clubhouse.
Members will decide on the pro
gram for the quarter. The meeting
is open, with ex-Walrus Club mem
bers and those interested in political
science especially invited.

i has ever laid his eyes upon! Only
i eight games scheduled and two of
them relatively unimportant, and
i not an eastern trip or a game with
I an eastern team for the first time in
years. Even if the team does win all
j of its games what chance have the
j fellows for national recognition with
such a schedule? Look at the sched
| ule of our southern neighbor, U.S.C.,
who has only a mediocre team but
plays games with Illinois, Pittsburgh,
j Notre Dame, and then takes a trip to
! Hawaii at Christmas.
Certainly, in all fairness to the
I greatest team that ever played on the
coast and to their coach, they should
be given a break. An eastern game
could be scheduled for November
30, one week after the Big Game.
This was done several years ago
when we sent a team back east to
play the Army, and there is no rea
son why it could not be done for our
ail-Americans of today.
I hope the students will arouse
themselves and voice their opinion
long and loudly in this matter.
Yours sincerely,
Don Clark
Stanford's football team right
fully rates an eastern game, but
possible opponents seem busy at
this late date. See editorial.â€”Ed.
