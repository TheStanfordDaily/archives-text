CLASSIC EXAMPLE of Scotch

ES HURT. ERASED AFFORD.
ERECTED. ANALYSIS HURT TOO,
INFECTIOUS DEAD.
THE AUTO SHOW business is
starting again. San Francisco's,
which commences November 16, will,
as usual, have the costliest enter
tainment: Ted Lewis and band at
$12,500. But we prefer Cleveland's
Burns and Allen at $10,000; Buffalo's
Lanny Ross at $3500; or, best of all,
Kansas City's Sally Rand at $5,000.
MUSIC NOTES: The musicians'
union lined Don Bestor $1,000 and
expelled him for one year for under
scaling his musicians, which, in
plain terms, means he paid 'em less
than union minimum. In addition,
Bestor must adjust their back sal
aries. The penalty means that Don
is out of a job for one year. . . .
After plugging "Love and a Dime"
and "East of the Sun" to nation
wide favorites, they've at last got
around to the third tune from
Princeton's Triangle Club produc
tion, "Stags at Bay." The new tunc
they've taken up is "Will Love Find
a Way," and it's just as good as the
other two.
AROUND THE DIAL: President
Roosevelt speaks on KFRC at 2:30
. . . An Leaf, best of the radio or
ganists, inaugurates a series of re
citals on the new Hammond electric
organ on KFRC at 6:15 . . . Glen
Gray's orchestra, with Walter
O'Kbefe, return for their fall Tues
day-Thursday series on KFRC dt
8:30.
