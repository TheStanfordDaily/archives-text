"THE CLAIRVOYANT"
At the Varsity Theater
FThe boresomeness of this
inane piece of British-made
nonsense is increased by the
over-acting of a pasty-faced
Claude Rains taking himself entirely
too seriously. For obvious reasons,
Rains was best as the "Invisible
Man."
Stupid as it is, the story concerns
itself with a fake mind-reader
(Rains) who finds his eyes bulging
out on various occasions with an
absurdly - impossible) clairvoyant
power. The direction and support
ing actresses (Fay Wray and Jane
Baxter) make Rains and the plot
seem even worse by comparison.

The Baer-Louis fight pictures on
the same program cannot save this
bill from a flunking "F."
