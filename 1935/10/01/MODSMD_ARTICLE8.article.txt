# Dr. Elliott to Lecture At 7:30 Tonight
## Speech Series To Open With Talk on First Years of Farm 
### 
Opening the Tuesday scries of
1 lectures in the Assembly Hall to
night at 7:30 o'clock, Dr. O. L. El
j liott, former registrar, will speak on
| the subject, "The First Years of
j Stanford."
It has been Dr. Elliott's interesting
j lot to follow the progress of the
i University since its birth 33 years
! ago, and this theme will serve as the
i basis for his address tonight.
"When I first came to Stanford
some two or three months before it
| opened," said Dr. Elliott, "the inner
| quadrangle, with the exception of
the Memorial Church, Encina Hall,
and Roble Hall (now Sequoia),
were the only buildings in exist
: ence."
Worked at Cornell
Before his arrival at Stanford, he
! had worked in the capacity of un
j dcrgraduate stenographer in the of
| f:ce of the president of Cornell Uni
! versity. Elliott served as University
Registrar until his retirement in
1925. His book, begun at that time,
but not yet ready for publication,
will contain a history of Stanford
for the first 25 yeax's, the period just
preceding the presidency of Dr.
Wilbur, and referred to by the au
thor as "the lean years." Asked
when he expected to finish his work,
Dr. Elliott replied to the effect that
each time someone asks him this
question, he tells them it is "nearer
completion."
Farm Interest Shown
The former registrar's oft-repeat
ed quotation serves as symbolic of
â–  his deep regard for Farm institu
j tions:
"It has been my happy lot to be
a part of the Stanford administra
tion through all its formative stages
and to witness the germination and
testing of nearly every regulation
which has affected the work and
wox-king together and student. The
registrar happens to stand where all
I roads converge."
