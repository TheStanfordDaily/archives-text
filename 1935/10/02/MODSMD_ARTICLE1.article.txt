# Farm May Get Intersectional Football Game
## Masters, Thornhill Have No Objection To Late Season Tilt Players Favor Plan Administration May Not Approve Contest 
### Gordy Frost 
Stanford may still get its post
season intersectional game. That
hope remained after a poll of in
terested parties — Graduate Man
ager Alfred Masters, Coach Tiny
Thornhill, and several team mem
bers—failed to produce any unsur
mountable objections last night.
The whole situation seems now
to lie in the fulfilling of two qual
ifications. First, that the admin
istration will sanction a game on
the proposed date, December 7,
three days before finals; second,
that a suitable eastern opponent
can he found.
For many months Masters has
been attempting to schedule an in
tersectional game for November 30
but no eastern teams were available
— every logical squad either was
busy on that date or chose to refuse
a meeting with the big red ma
chine. Masters' offers to meet either
on the easterners' field or on Stan
ford's own were turned aside with
equal vigor.
Must Play Here
Then the possibility of matching
the Indians with eastern competi
tion on the following week-end, De
cember 7, was suggested. This meet
ing would have to be made on the
home field, however, since only
three days would remain before
finals—not long enough to return
from the east if the game were
played there.
Masters said he favors the sched
uling of such an affair if the foot
ball men themselves would like to
play it. And so the football men
were consulted.-
Monk Moscrip and Boh Reynolds
would like to see it planned. They
agree that it would be Stanford's
only opportunity to be ranked
with the best of the eastern field
if the season should go by with
out a hitch. And they opined that
"most of the other fellows feel
the same way."
And even if the season didn't go
so well, they said they would like
to play an eastern team.
Thornhill Approves
Thornhill was in favor from Ihe
standpoint that it would be the only
chance to receive national recogni
tion, too. But he did not think that
such a match would be a money
maker.
"Residents of the Bay Region
have seen too much football by
that time. They won't come." That
was the way Tiny looked at the
problem. But Masters, who is pri
marily concerned with the busi
ness angle of the proposed contest,
indicated that a home game would
have nearly as great a drawing
power as a match in New York or
Chicago, "provided a first class
team were scheduled."
President Ray Lyman Wilbur de
clined to comment concerning any
administration objection to schedul
ing a game so close to the final ex
amination period.
