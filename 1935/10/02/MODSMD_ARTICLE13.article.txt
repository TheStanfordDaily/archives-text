# Local Chapter Backs Boycott
## Campus L.I.D. President Defends Hearst Ban 
### 
While no anti-Hearst boycott com
parable to that suggested at U.C.
will be held at Stanford, members of
the local chapter of the League for
Industrial Democracy will at least
morally back the Berkeley protest,
it was announced yesterday by Eliz
abeth De Vinney, their acting presi
dent.
"Hearst stands as an ominous
threat to the very purposes set forth
in the preamble to the Constitution
of the United States," she declared
in a letter to The Daily here.
The Constitution, she pointed out,
is the very thing the Sentries of
American Youth, a U.C. anti-radical
organization, pledged itself to sup
port when it was organized Thurs
day.
This organization "effectively il
lustrates the stumbling block, or
should I say the chopping block,
which all such 'enlightened' persons
as the Sentries place in their way,"
Miss De Vinney continued.
"Hearst is the very symbol of those
methods and practices which these
guarding sentries of U.C. are organ
ized to prevent; namely, strong-arm
vigilant ism and the operation of in
sidious influences.
"History points out for as that
there is no middle ground. Indi
viduals who seek to occupy such a
position are always crushed. To look
back to the issue over which the
Civil War was fought—one was ei
ther for or against slavery—there
were no 'ifs' or 'buts'. Just as sharp
ly defined is the stand on the Hearst
boycott.
"The question of communism or
radicalism is only an evasion of the
issue. Do we believe in freedom of
expicssion and the ethics of honest
journalism? As distinct as black
and white is our answer."
