# Grayson Will Enter U. S. F. Game Saturday
## Hamilton, Adams Unlikely To Be in Line-up 
### 
Two days ago the sideline cynics
had things this way: Bobby Grayson
probably wouldn't be able to play
until the Washington game a month
hence, and Bones Hamilton and
Woody Adams more than likely
would meet U.S.F. Saturday.
But yesterday all of that was
j changed.
For who should be seen out on
the practice field yesterday after
noon but Bobby Grayson, in gray
j sweatshirt and cleats, looking
very healthy and only favoring the
j all-important left limb just a
little. The step-and-a-half gait
; was gleefully overlooked, however,
1 for Bobby is all set to play Satur
j day..
His injured ankle tendon injury
j fortunately was of the category that
| can be taped, and taped it was, al
j lowing the smiling boomer to run
j through signals with the second
I team, when that outfit paged for a
! spare quarterback.
And Bones Hamilton and Woody
i Adams, the pair that Monday was
} given the odds on playing with
| U.S.F., were both still in the hospi
j tal and Dr. Fritz Roth seemed du
j bious that they would be able to
i meet the Dons.
With Grayson back Saturday,
that would leave five "first
stringers" for the backfield. Paul-
I man would still be at quarter, Bob
at full, but then there would he
Vigna, Alustiza, and Coflis for
halves.
Still in the top-notch bracket are
Johnny Reisner, the fleet rugby and
track star, Ray Todd, veteran full,
and Tom Collins, soph who made a
nice run Saturday. That trio formed
Tiny's- second backfield.
In the second-string line appeared:
ends, Carl Schott and Alex Trompas,
recovered from a poison oak infec
tion, Swede Carlson and Pop Grant,
tackles; Larry Cooke and Porky
Cunoo, guards; and Bubble Muller,
center.
On Saturday students and faculty
will present their cards at Gate 15,
on the park side of Kezar, directly
opposite the press box. Student body
cards will be checked and any mis
use will cause cards to be confis
cated. The Rally Committee re
quests that rooters' caps be worn.
