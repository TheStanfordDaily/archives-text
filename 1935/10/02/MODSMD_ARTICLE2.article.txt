# Grayson Will Enter U. S. F. Game Saturday
## Hamilton, Adams Unlikely To Be in Line-up 
### 
Two days ago the sideline cynics
had things this way: Bobby Grayson
probably wouldn't be able to play
until the Washington game a month
hence, and Bones Hamilton and
Woody Adams more than likely
would meet U.S.F. Saturday.
But yesterday all of that was
j changed.
For who should be seen out on
the practice field yesterday after
noon but Bobby Grayson, in gray
j sweatshirt and cleats, looking
very healthy and only favoring the
j all-important left limb just a
little. The step-and-a-half gait
; was gleefully overlooked, however,
1 for Bobby is all set to play Satur
j day..
His injured ankle tendon injury
j fortunately was of the category that
| can be taped, and taped it was, al
j lowing the smiling boomer to run
j through signals with the second
I team, when that outfit paged for a
! spare quarterback.
And Bones Hamilton and Woody
i Adams, the pair that Monday was
} given the odds on playing with
| U.S.F., were both still in the hospi
j tal and Dr. Fritz Roth seemed du
j bious that they would be able to
i meet the Dons.
With Grayson back Saturday,
that would leave five "first
stringers" for the backfield. Paul-
I man would still be at quarter, Bob
