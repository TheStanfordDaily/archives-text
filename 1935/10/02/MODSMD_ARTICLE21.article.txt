# Students To Return $583,000 Building Costs Over Twenty Years; $500 Awarded For Aid to Needy Students
## 
### 
Ex Committee passes theater loans as pleasantly as the Board of
Trustees, discovered Comptroller Almon E. Rntli last night. Members
listened to his explanations of changes, inspected plans, and finally ap
proved the additional sum of $.'15,000 required before building can start
in November.
Total costs for the structure arc now set at a minimum of $583,701,
with $3(50,000 of that amount to be borrowed from the University at an

interest rate of 5 per cent. A term
of 20 years and nine months will be
needed for finishing payment, said
Roth.
The main building will seat (550,
850, or 1550, depending upon wheth
er or not parts are closed off. A
little theater of 150 will open off the
same stage. Class rooms, technically
complete stage, and workshops com
plete the Memorial Hall.
Outlines Policy
President Wally Brooke outlined a
routine policy, stressing attendance,
outlining the system of requiring
applications from candidates for ap
pointments, and asking that all busi
j ness be filed by 2 o'clock the day
! before each meeting.
Jack MacDowell—not, he empha-
I sizes, John—representing the fund
for self-supporting students, was
voted $500 for scholarships. An ad
-1 ditional $500 may be granted later if
| Cros' budget permits.
The Round Tabic Confcrencc on
Student Problems is a good idea,
agreed members. They okayed
Brooke's proposition for a meet
ing once every two weeks, to be
attended by I>ean Mary Yost,
Professor Edwin A. Cottrell, and
campus leaders, who meet first at
! 1 o'clock today.
A minor skirmish about, the Wom
, en's Conference request for a closed
date on October 18 for their annual
party enlivened granting of dates.
; "The row will come anyway and the
freshmen have to," remarked Ful
lenwider. "What are we worrying
! about?"
Board Appointed
Election Board will be absolutely
impartial this year. Brooke made
[ sure of that when he recommended
six row, six hall—sijf men, and six
women. Members passed include
Jim Ludlam, Esther Pelton, Bob
j Clark, Guy Neely, Ed Butterworth,
Peg Woodard, Jane Offield, Sid Vor
j mor, Bud Lesser, Priscilla Mcrwin,
1 and Jackie Brown.
Theater Group Named
Five student advisers will assist
i Roth on theater plans, outline the
S dedication ceremony, and constitute
the Theater Committee. They are
Phil Brown. Bob Gros, A1 Hyman,
i Annalee Whitmore, and Wally
! Brooke, ex officio.
Gib Holloway was named as new
high school assembly head. His du
ties will include planning programs,
in conjunction with the Cardinals,
i for presentation in local prep
| schools.
Triple Personality
Bob Gros' triumph of the evening
i came when he moved to accept his
own resignation as graduate mem
j ber. "I have an ace up my sleeve,"
i grinned Gros. "I'm here as chairman
of Men's Council and student man
' ager, too." He will fill the third post,
however, until his successor is
i chosen.
Publications Council, Cardinals,
and Dramatic Council minutes were
i passed. Nelson Eddy's changed con
cert date met with approval, as did
' the proposal that tipping at dances bo
abolished. Hat and coat checkers, he
I said, should be paid out of gate re-
J ceipts of the dance.
