Baffling Play
Characters in this intense tragedy
of frustration arc not so much peo
ple as various phases of life. It has
! been considered O'Neill's most baf
i fliiig play, mainly due to his use of
masks to symbolize the transference
' and fusion of personalities.
The tragedy is rooted in mankind's
frantic attempts "to belong," to be in
j rhythm with nature, and in the
I idealism that is constantly being
i crushed by the blind conventions of
| the "practical world."
