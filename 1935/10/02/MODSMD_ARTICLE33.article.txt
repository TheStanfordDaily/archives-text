# Symposium Plan Tested For University Debates

### 
"Throughout life one must face
j alternatives. Literature and history
; are full of examples. Situations in
; which the selection of one of three
! or four alternatives is imperative are
! continually arising."
These words of Lee Chapin, de
, bating coach, express the condition
i which gave rise to the symposium
method of debating, now being tried
| at Stanford.
| Unlike the old system of debating
I which sets up a question to be either
upheld or denied, the aim of the
| symposium is to present the possible
solutions to a problem, Mr. Chapin
explained. He suggests problems on
such subjects as the motion picture,
education, or the reorganization of
state government, which may be
! viewed from many angles. Alter the
various solutions have been outlined

by the speakers, the audience
chooses the one which it believes to
be most fitting. To come to their
decision, the audience may ask any
questions of the speakers.
Professor John Dewey of Colum
bia University was the first to sug
gest that the symposium method be
used in plac? of the old system of
debate. In Oregon, it has been used
so successfully that the state uni
versity there has abandoned the old
system. Though the idea has been
developing for several years, this is
the first time it has been actively
tried at Stanford, Mr. Chapin said.
The symposium possesses greater
educational value than the old style
method of debating, he believes, It
permits not only the speakers but
also the audience to take an active
part in discussion and affords fine
practice in speaking. It attempts to
discover a real solution to problems
and cannot be won on technicalities.
