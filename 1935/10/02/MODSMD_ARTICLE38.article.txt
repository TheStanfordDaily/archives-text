# Yearlings in Shape For Grid Tilt With Sacramento Jay see
## Three Injuries Handicap First String; Game Line-up Changed 
### Hob Leland 
With the intention of smoothing
off the rough edges in the Papoose
machine, Coach Jimmy Bradshaw
put his charges through a vigorous
offensive scrimmage with the third
string, and a defensive workout
against Sacramento plays run by the
fourth-stringers.
Several changes were noted in
the line-up. Ted Noll and Walt
I lege were at the ends. Davis was
in place of McMillan, who was not
in a suit.* Bill Hawkins at right
half and Iluebei at left half com
pleted the changes. These men,
along with Pete Zagar, Dave Car
nalian, Fred Gustafson, Dick Sut
ton, Fd Gamier, and Wally de-
Witt made up a first string that
will probably start against the
Jaysee team.
During the offensive scrimmage
ihe team looked good and bad in
turn, but is much farther along the
road than when it played the Greys.
The second string took over the of
fensive chores after the first went on
defense, and they looked better.
Their plays worked smoother for the
most part, and they cleaned up nice
ly for the ball carrier.
Several injuries, seemingly of a
minor nature, marred the day's
work. Crow, guard, received a nasty
blow on the nose. Bill Kirsch got a
cut under the eye from a collision
when someone ran the wrong way.
