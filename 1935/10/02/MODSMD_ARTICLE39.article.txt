# Gain Polo Win Under Handicap
## 
### 
After a somewhat ragged per
formance until the closing minutes
of the game, the Stanford varsity
water polo squad managed to eke out
a 3-2 win over the Athens Club Mon
day night.
That his squad was unable to
hang up a more imposing win is
not in the least surprising to
Coach Nort Thornton for more
| than one reason. Foremost is the
fact that the men couldn't use
Thornton's newly devised offense
formation—the system they have
been at work on since the first of
the year — because the California
team and coach turned out to scout
the Indians 1 new plays.
The poloists were prepared with
| little else than the new system in
| the way of offensive tactics, and
| were further weakened by the ab
; sence of Bill Clemo, veteran regu
lar, who was on the sidelines with
I a stiff neck.
Defense seemed to be the strong
est point in the Cardinals' favor,
what with VVoodard, Wiget, and
; Ilaslacher turning in brilliant
performances.
California and the Olympic Club
j will meet Friday evening in Berke
ley. The results of this tilt will give
| the Cardinals an estimation of what
j they'll have to beat if they are to be
| successful in thair quest for league
| honors.
