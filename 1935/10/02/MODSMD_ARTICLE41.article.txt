THESE DONS WON'T
BE A CINCH
University of San Francisco's Dons
aren't going to be any cinch for
Stanford Saturday, but unless some
thing goes extremely haywire the
old Indian ought to come out on top
all right. At least that's the way tha
dopemen have been sizing up the
situation for the week-end.
It was three years ago that Stan
ford first tackled the Dons on the
gridiron field of battle and since that
time they've been causing more
worry each year.
First, in 1932, Stanford had a fairly
easy time; they crushed U.S.F.
neatly under a 20-0 score. The next
year it wasn't quite as simple, 20-7.
Then last year it was too close for
any comfort.
That 3-0 win eked out by a gang
of Indian cripples after three
quarters of pounding into a stub
born, valiant team of underdogs
taught us to respect U.S.F.
This game Saturday will be an
other typical U.S.F. battle. They'll
be out to trip the great Stanford
varsity, just as they have tried the

last three times, and this year they
have a lot of material and fight to
keep the Cards guessing.
Their showing last week against
Santa Clara's mighty Bronco eleven
was better than the 20-7 score
would indicate. Two blocked kicks
resulting in a pair of scores really
marked the margin of victory,
j In the last period U.S.F. made its
I one touchdown and though Clipper
Smith had a lot of his first-stringers
on the bench at that time the Dons
showed an offense that, with another
week's training behind, will cause
; some worry.
WATCH THESE
FELLOWS SATURDAY
This fellow Prentiss Wells is well
worth watching. He turned in the
j longest run of the game at Kezar
; last week, tore through half the
Bronc team after the kick-off for a
53-yard return.
And he's just a substitute. Bac
ciarini is the regular left half and
he's supposed to be one of the best
in the game. Watch him throw
passes Saturday.
Then this Sal Seeno is no slouch
either, and his sub, Poocher Pucci,
has the drive and power to push
into the center of the line.
As far as linemen are concerned
U.S.F. looked weaker last Saturday
| than they did a year ago against
Santa Clara. But they'll get a lot
of work done this week and that's
what their line coach, Dal Marvil.
| says they need most.
Dal was in the press box at the
Stanford-San Jose State game last
j Saturday doing a little scouting.
And it must be admitted that he
looked mighty happy during those
first two quarters. Still we're glad
he stayed till the end. That last
half might have counteracted a bit
of skepticism. —Frost

Bronc team after the kick-off for a
53-yard return.
And he's just a substitute. Bac
ciarini is the regular left half and
he's supposed to be one of the best
in the game. Watch him throw
passes Saturday.
Then this Sal Seeno is no slouch
either, and his sub, Poocher Pucci,
has the drive and power to push
into the center of the line.
As far as linemen are concerned
U.S.F. looked weaker last Saturday
| than they did a year ago against
Santa Clara. But they'll get a lot
of work done this week and that's
what their line coach, Dal Marvil.
| says they need most.
Dal was in the press box at the
Stanford-San Jose State game last
j Saturday doing a little scouting.
And it must be admitted that he
looked mighty happy during those
first two quarters. Still we're glad
he stayed till the end. That last
half might have counteracted a bit
of skepticism. —Frost
THESE DONS WON'T
BE A CINCH
University of San Francisco's Dons
aren't going to be any cinch for
Stanford Saturday, but unless some
thing goes extremely haywire the
old Indian ought to come out on top
all right. At least that's the way tha
dopemen have been sizing up the
situation for the week-end.
It was three years ago that Stan
ford first tackled the Dons on the
gridiron field of battle and since that
time they've been causing more
worry each year.
First, in 1932, Stanford had a fairly
easy time; they crushed U.S.F.
neatly under a 20-0 score. The next
year it wasn't quite as simple, 20-7.
Then last year it was too close for
any comfort.
That 3-0 win eked out by a gang
of Indian cripples after three
quarters of pounding into a stub
born, valiant team of underdogs
taught us to respect U.S.F.
This game Saturday will be an
other typical U.S.F. battle. They'll
be out to trip the great Stanford
varsity, just as they have tried the

last three times, and this year they
have a lot of material and fight to
keep the Cards guessing.
Their showing last week against
Santa Clara's mighty Bronco eleven
was better than the 20-7 score
would indicate. Two blocked kicks
resulting in a pair of scores really
marked the margin of victory,
j In the last period U.S.F. made its
I one touchdown and though Clipper
Smith had a lot of his first-stringers
on the bench at that time the Dons
showed an offense that, with another
week's training behind, will cause
; some worry.
WATCH THESE
FELLOWS SATURDAY
This fellow Prentiss Wells is well
worth watching. He turned in the
j longest run of the game at Kezar
; last week, tore through half the
Bronc team after the kick-off for a
53-yard return.
