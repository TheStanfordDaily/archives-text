# Large Turnout For Basketball Is Promising
## Guarding and Shooting To Be Stressed In Practice 
### 
Fears expressed early last week
that Bryan "Dinty" Moore, stellar
guard and captain of last year's hoop
squad, might not be able to play
again this year due to an illness con
tracted late in the summer were
quieted Monday when the all-Coast
player returned to the Farm and re
ported for the first tum-out.
Although he will not be able to
exercise much for a couple of weeks,
his return added an air of encour
agement to the whole team.
According to Coach John Bunn,
work on fundamentals, guarding,
passing, and shooting will be stressed
for the next few weeks, with no ac
tual playing.
Although it is too early to say
which of the 40 men turning out for
the squad shows the most promise,
it is safe to say that "Hank" Luisetti,
lanky frosh star from last year, Bob
Zonne, also a star player up from
last year's frosh squad, Art Stoeffen,
an ineligible last year, and Howell
Turner, consistently good varsity
forward, will all be at top speed in a
week or so and will be working very
hard to cinch those first five posi
tions.
In the turnouts this week Bunn
has been working the men especially
on blocking and shooting short shots
near the basket. In about two weeks
he expects to begin scrimmaging the
men a little but until that time will
confine the workouts to practice on
fundamentals.
