# Tigers Play Cubs As Series Opens
## 
### 
DETROIT, Oct. 1 (/J I ).—Baseball's
big shqw, shaking off the chilling
effects of an unwelcome blast of
football weather, opens tomorrow in
full panoply. It brings together the
Detroit Tigers, two-time American
League champions, and the Chicago
Cubs, stretch-sensations of the Na
tional League pennant race, in an
uproar of old-time rivalry.
Capacity Crowd
Navin Field, furnishing the start
ing battleground for the second
straight year, likely will be packed
to its capacity of 48,700. a new high
for the park, when the two lanky
sharpshooters from Arkansas, Lyn
wood (Schoolboy) Rowe of the
Tigers and Lonnie Warneke of the
Cubs, unwrap their good right arms
for a pitching duel that may add a
bright chapter to World Series his
tory.
The Tigers have been slight fa
vorites to capture the series, among
wagering men, but a rush of Chicago
money indicated a possible switch.
It may be an even-money proposi
tion by tomorrow. Based upon the
pre-series evidence, it looks like the
biggest betting series in at least *ix
years.
Cubs Odds Hisc
A majority of baseball experts,
after watching the two clubs go
through their final practice paces
between showers at Navin Field to
day, indicated a preference for Chi
cago's chances. Their opinions, how
ever, are sharply divided for the
most part. Admittedly, it's a tough
series to "dope." It figures to go six
games but it might end quickly, de
pending upon whether the Cubs
continue to ride the crest of 'their
remarkable winning pace or sud
denly go to pieces against the power
ful, more experienced Tigers.
Chicago's hopes are hinged large
ly upon the long right arm of War

! neke, the pride of the Ozarks, just
\ as the Tigers place supreme confi
dence in the sharpshooting ability of
Rowe. Both are great "money"
pitchers, with a world of stuff but
Warneke enters the championship
test with a record unmatched by any
other pitcher in baseball over the
last month. Lonnie has captured his
last seven games, most of them un
-1 der pressure and against the best the
| opposition could offer. Rowe's con
j trol has been erratic and the School
boy doesn't do his best in cool
I weather.
Pitchers Ready
Manager Charley Grimm, the ban
jo-playing, fun-loving pilot of the
National League champions, ended
all speculation about his pitching
1 plans after putting his aggressive
I young outfit through the final tune
!up paces. He will pitch the veteran
i Charley Root in the second game,
j probably against Tommy Bridges,
J slim curve ball artist of the Tigers.
Big Bill Lee, freshman right
| hander, will draw the third game as
signment at Wrigley Field, likely
, against Detroit's Elden Auker, sub
marine ball right-hander.
Warneke will be shot right back
; into action for the fourth game and
! he will be ready again for the sev
! enth game in Detroit, if the series
I goes the limit. There has been an
idea in the Tiger camp that War
neke, lean and lanky, cannot stand
| the strain of too much work.

Manager Charley Grimm, the ban

Big Bill Lee, freshman right

DETROIT, Oct. 1 (/J I ).—Baseball's
big shqw, shaking off the chilling
effects of an unwelcome blast of
football weather, opens tomorrow in
full panoply. It brings together the
Detroit Tigers, two-time American
League champions, and the Chicago
Cubs, stretch-sensations of the Na
tional League pennant race, in an
uproar of old-time rivalry.
Capacity Crowd
Navin Field, furnishing the start
ing battleground for the second
straight year, likely will be packed
to its capacity of 48,700. a new high
for the park, when the two lanky
sharpshooters from Arkansas, Lyn
wood (Schoolboy) Rowe of the
Tigers and Lonnie Warneke of the
Cubs, unwrap their good right arms
for a pitching duel that may add a
bright chapter to World Series his
tory.
The Tigers have been slight fa
vorites to capture the series, among
wagering men, but a rush of Chicago
money indicated a possible switch.
It may be an even-money proposi
tion by tomorrow. Based upon the
pre-series evidence, it looks like the
biggest betting series in at least *ix
years.
Cubs Odds Hisc
A majority of baseball experts,
after watching the two clubs go
through their final practice paces
between showers at Navin Field to
day, indicated a preference for Chi
cago's chances. Their opinions, how
ever, are sharply divided for the
most part. Admittedly, it's a tough
series to "dope." It figures to go six
games but it might end quickly, de
pending upon whether the Cubs
continue to ride the crest of 'their
remarkable winning pace or sud
denly go to pieces against the power
ful, more experienced Tigers.
Chicago's hopes are hinged large
ly upon the long right arm of War

! neke, the pride of the Ozarks, just
\ as the Tigers place supreme confi
dence in the sharpshooting ability of
Rowe. Both are great "money"
pitchers, with a world of stuff but
Warneke enters the championship
test with a record unmatched by any
other pitcher in baseball over the
last month. Lonnie has captured his
last seven games, most of them un
-1 der pressure and against the best the
| opposition could offer. Rowe's con
j trol has been erratic and the School
boy doesn't do his best in cool
I weather.
