## Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily Membei of the Associated Press Ex Committee Clears Final Obstacle To Building of Long-A waited Theater 
### 
With the approval last night by the Ex.
Committee of the thirty-live thousand dollar
loan from the Associated Students for the
proposed live hundred and eighty-three thou
sand dollar Memorial Hall, the last obstruc
tion to Stanford's long-awaited and widely
acclaimed theater was finally brushed aside.
In 1919 the plan for a War Memorial on the
campus was conceived and funds donated.
Six years ago Chupurrtil brought to a head
vague campus murmurs anent a much-needed
theater for the Farm. For want of strenuous
support the idea began to fade, until three
years ago an intensive drive for a memorial
theater which could use the idle memorial
fund put the question before the campus
again. Daily editors, student body presidents,
and campus leaders backed the move.
Last night those same leaders saw their
hopes finally realized. According to Comp
troller Roth, work on the structure will prob
ably commence by November, with comple
tion of the building by next summer.

To raise the thirty-five thousand dollars
granted by the Associated Students, a levy ol
one dollar a quarter will he continued for
approximately the next twenty years, which
will mean a twelve-dollar tax at the most on
the average Stanford student. This assess
ment will he taken philosophically by the
carefree Hough as his endowment to the Uni
versity.
The new loan was necessitated by the
change in plans to lit the wants and needs ol
the students and the affected departments of
the University, to meet the rise in costs, and
to build the type of structure required to lend
safety in a country troubled by earthquqakes.
So a year from now the returning students
w ill see standing near the location of the old
library foundations Stanford's five hundred
and eighty-three thousand dollar theater, the
product of ceaseless work on the part of a
group of campus leaders with the backing,
both morally and financially, of faculty, board
of trustees, and student body.
