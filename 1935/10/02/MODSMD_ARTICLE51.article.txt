# Elusive Petition Hopelessly Seeks Saint Mary's Game
## 
### 
Two San Francisco newspapers in the past
few days have carried the news that a petition
is being circulated at Stanford asking for a
football game with St. Mary's on October 19.
Investigation so far has failed to produce any
evidence, other than campus rumor, that such
a petition exists.
Apparently the alleged sponsors of the peti
tion either are mere publicity seekers or are
attempting to weigh Stanford sentiment on
the subject before bringing the petition into
tangible form. Certainly they cannot succeed
in their objective by keeping their work se
cret; the game, if it were scheduled, assuredly
would not be played under cover.
However, there is little danger of the as
sertedly proposed game ever materializing.
Last spring, when it was suggested to the
Ji.A.C. that it schedule a game with St. Mary's,
there were too many alumni objections to
permit serious consideration of it. It was
further pointed out that a hard, potentially
rough game at that time would be folly from
the team's standpoint, with Washington,
Santa Clara, and U.S.C. contests coming up
on the succeeding Saturdays.
The sponsors of this apparently invisible
petition have accomplished their aim, it' pub
licitv-sccking was their aim, but if their re
quest for an Indian-Gael game is intended
seriously, they have little likelihood of suc
cess.
