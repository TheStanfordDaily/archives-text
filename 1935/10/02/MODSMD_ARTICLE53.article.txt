# Our Hasher Sez

### 
It. is with full play of the emotions, sorrow, and
stuff that I take up the time of my three or four avid
(and probably vapid) readers in a purely personal
quarrel between Our Hasher and 255 Roble women,
evidenced by the spirited outbreak of rebellion in
yesterday's "Vox Campi."
The stigma of being unfair to Union and Roble
labor is a most harsh one for Our Hasher to accept,
because hashers in their subservient manner are, as a
class, the flower of Southern, Northern, Eastern, and
Western chivalry.
The issue involved is that Our Hasher charged the
freshman women with being "terrific." Apparently, the
freshman women resent being classed with all-Amer
icans, big league stars, and the latest movie classic.
Perhaps I should have said they were "colossal," or
maybe only "huge."
Nonetheless, the elusive, mysterious, wispy, crispy
"F.G." has flung the gauntlet in my face, saying that
the "freshman women backed up to the looking-glass
and found themselves far superior to the fresh-men
(hashers in particular)." Doubting at the outset the
questionable maneuvers around the looking glass, Our
Hasher, trying at all times to maintain a judicial calm,
further doubts the scientific veracity of an experiment
conducted without the collateral evidence of seeing the
men back up to a looking-glass.
I again quarrel with her contention about the hash
ers in particular, knowing as I do the personal follow
ing in Roble that is maintained from year to year by a
certain dark-complexioned, curly-locked tennis player.
I am not attempting to ridicule F.G.'s campus
opinion, which was very, very clever indeed. But to be
held up to scorn and ridicule in the public prints,
hurts Our Hasher's sensitive soul, which is very sensi
tive indeed.
Health—s6 1 ; metabolism—on alkaline side; ceiling
—low; soul—sensitive.
As to her kind invitation to come around to Roble
t<» start getting my education, I will say that the last
time 1 tried getting my education at Roble, I flunked
the course.
If I have insulted the freshman women I apologize.
If it will make them feel any better, I will insult the
freshman men. Of Stanford's glorious, glamorous,
beautiful, spontaneous, combustible, charming, exotic
freshman women, I beg apology. You're TERRIFIC.

As to her kind invitation to come around to Roble

time 1 tried getting my education at Roble, I flunked
the course.
If I have insulted the freshman women I apologize.
If it will make them feel any better, I will insult the
freshman men. Of Stanford's glorious, glamorous,
beautiful, spontaneous, combustible, charming, exotic
freshman women, I beg apology. You're TERRIFIC.
It. is with full play of the emotions, sorrow, and
stuff that I take up the time of my three or four avid
(and probably vapid) readers in a purely personal
quarrel between Our Hasher and 255 Roble women,
evidenced by the spirited outbreak of rebellion in
yesterday's "Vox Campi."
The stigma of being unfair to Union and Roble
labor is a most harsh one for Our Hasher to accept,
because hashers in their subservient manner are, as a
class, the flower of Southern, Northern, Eastern, and
Western chivalry.
The issue involved is that Our Hasher charged the
freshman women with being "terrific." Apparently, the
freshman women resent being classed with all-Amer
icans, big league stars, and the latest movie classic.
Perhaps I should have said they were "colossal," or
maybe only "huge."
Nonetheless, the elusive, mysterious, wispy, crispy
"F.G." has flung the gauntlet in my face, saying that
the "freshman women backed up to the looking-glass
and found themselves far superior to the fresh-men
(hashers in particular)." Doubting at the outset the
questionable maneuvers around the looking glass, Our
Hasher, trying at all times to maintain a judicial calm,
further doubts the scientific veracity of an experiment
conducted without the collateral evidence of seeing the
men back up to a looking-glass.
I again quarrel with her contention about the hash
ers in particular, knowing as I do the personal follow
ing in Roble that is maintained from year to year by a
certain dark-complexioned, curly-locked tennis player.
I am not attempting to ridicule F.G.'s campus
opinion, which was very, very clever indeed. But to be
held up to scorn and ridicule in the public prints,
hurts Our Hasher's sensitive soul, which is very sensi
tive indeed.
