# Bull Session
## SLY ADOLPH STEALS A MARCH 
### 
The storm clouds of Jewish and Catholic persecu
tion hover over the scene of the 1936 Olympics. . . .
In the United States a congressman . . . other agitators
. . . thump the drum for America's withdrawal . . .
and Herr Hitler steals a march.
* * * *
When the question of Olympic non-participation
was raised some weeks ago, loud were the acclaims
and noisy were the protests. Some just couldn't stom
ach the thought of American youth running the low
hurdles side by side with a bunch of savage Nazis
who the week before might have laughed villainously
as the German government dispossessed a score of
Catholics or Jews of their life or property. Others
couldn't bear the thought of the U. S. missing a chance
to bring home again the lion's share of the champion
ships.
* * * *
By now it's pretty well understood that the United
States won't withdraw. The Olympiad is too delectable
a dish for the stuffed-shirts who waste so much of their
time in governing amateur athletes to pass up. They
want to make an ocean voyage, and pose around the
finish lines.
* * * *
What is regrettable is that the United States had a
golden opportunity to make Mr. Hitler squirm right
down, to the bottom of his sloppy Nazi boots, and they
didn't take advantage of it. This country could have
searched out all the Rosenblooms, Cohens, and Abrams,
and all the big Irish-Catholics who could throw a
discus or run a mile and flaunted them right in the
face of the German dictator. How those Jews and
Catholics would have delighted in helping to force the
bitter dregs of defeat down the gullets of Hitlerites!
♦ * * *
But instead of doing any such thing,' the afore
mentioned stufTed-shirts just talked about it, and
Hitler heai'd. And now what has he done? Just last
week he issued a formal invitation to a German Jewess
fencing champion over there at Mills College to join
the Nazi Olympic team. Instead of Germany's op
ponents pitting Jews against Nazis, Germany will be
sending out Jews to oppose the opponents.
Scowling Adolph has the craftiness of Pop Eye
when it comcs to dictating.

golden opportunity to make Mr. Hitler squirm right
down, to the bottom of his sloppy Nazi boots, and they
didn't take advantage of it. This country could have
searched out all the Rosenblooms, Cohens, and Abrams,
and all the big Irish-Catholics who could throw a
discus or run a mile and flaunted them right in the
face of the German dictator. How those Jews and
Catholics would have delighted in helping to force the
bitter dregs of defeat down the gullets of Hitlerites!

But instead of doing any such thing,' the afore
mentioned stufTed-shirts just talked about it, and
Hitler heai'd. And now what has he done? Just last
week he issued a formal invitation to a German Jewess
fencing champion over there at Mills College to join
the Nazi Olympic team. Instead of Germany's op
ponents pitting Jews against Nazis, Germany will be
sending out Jews to oppose the opponents.
Scowling Adolph has the craftiness of Pop Eye
