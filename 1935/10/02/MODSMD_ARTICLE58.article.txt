# MOKE FROM ROBLE

I The Editor, Sir:
; We of the freshman women wish
| to repudiate the theory sponsored
j by the males (pardon the evasion of
| the terminology "men") of the fresh
man class that this year's influx of
i women are "terrible."
Would it be presumptuous to won
der if the freshman boys are capable
i of intelligently accepting a woman
i for her potentialities as a capable
' human rather than a nin-com-poop
j of sophistication to cover up a
marked deficiency possessive of a
! Venus de Milo face to be used solely
j as a means of intrancement or as a
| reciprocant for. rouges, lipstick un
! necessarily thick, powder, and May-
I belline.
We might suggest that these boys
I return to their source of deviation
! and make room for intelligent and

appreciative men. M. H., '39
You got us.â€”Ed.
