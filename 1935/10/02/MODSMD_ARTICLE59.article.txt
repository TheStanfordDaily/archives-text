# HITS REVIEWER

### 
The Editor, Sir:
Film criticism at Stanford hit a
new low on Tuesday when your Mr.
Botsford attempted to "review" an
English film, "Clairvoyant."
Mr. Botsford disliked this film,
and I strongly suspect that his an
tipathy was due to the unfamiliar
subject and treatment of this film.
Had the picture featured Betty
Blush in Super-Colossal's "Hearts
for Sale," or something similar, per
haps he would have handled it more
gently. . . .
S. E.
It is alleged there are two sides
to every question.â€”Ed.
