At the Fox-Stanford
Alt's here! The picture
that's broken box office rec- j
ords all over the country
in a sensational streak is !
here at last. And if an "A" rating is
reserved for a super-super picture, ,
then "Top Hat" should be rated :
triple-A.
Fred Astaire is gayer and more
insouciant than ever, and his danc- j
ing is sheer delight to watch. Ginger J
Rogers is the loveliest stooge pos
sible, and her dancing is almost as I
able as his.
There's a highly improbable plot
revolving around mistaken identity j
that's rushed through as quickly as
possible to leave plenty of time for
the Astaire-Rogers brand of terpsi
chore and Irving Berlin's swell score. J
If you're one of those impossible I
creatures that don't like this show, '
the best we can say is, "A pox on j
| you!"
