# Roth Praises Equipment Of New Theater
## Upholstered Seats, Broad Aisles, Bring Luxury To Playgoers Excavate Next Month Playhouse Upkeep Will Be Large Item 
### 
Excavations early in November —
concrete pouring begun by Decem
ber—steel work during January and
February—completion by next fall
quarter—
That is the schedule tentatively
set for Stanford's long-awaited and
much-ballyhooed Memorial The
ater.
Ex Committee's sanction of the
additional $35,000 loan completes a
project which was begun after the
World War. Three complete sets of
plans have been drawn up during
the last year alone, and one after
another found lacking in some de
tail. But Ex Committee's stamp of
approval makes definite progress on
the present structure assured.
Comfort Guaranteed
"I guarantee that it will be tho
most comfortable theater you ever
attended," said Comptroller Almon
E. Roth last night. To prove his
point, he cites the broad aisles,
roomy, well-upholstered seats, air
conditioned heat system, dual light
ing, and luxurious decorations.
Modern Lighting
Technical features are fully as
perfect. An electrical control board,
which resembles that in the Pasa
dena Community Playhouse, is plan
ned. It will permit complete setting
of lights for two entire scenes; so
that one fiick of a switch will flood
the stage with the correct light in the
correct place.
Between $3500 and $4000 will be
required each year for maintenance,
predicts Roth. The classrooms,
dressing rooms, showers, and work
shops, in addition to the two audi
toriums, will be kept immaculate,
and require a corps of janitors.
Stage Scats 500
"In a pinch, 500 people could be
seated on the stage alone," said the
comptroller. The auditorium, seat
ing 1550, will be fmple for Concert
Series, as outsiders would be willing
to pay more for the luxurious seats
and better facilities, he thinks.
He asks students to remember that
the building will not be exclusively
a theater. Plans call for a Memo
rial Hall, to be used for classes in
School of the Theater, assemblies,
concerts, and other events.
