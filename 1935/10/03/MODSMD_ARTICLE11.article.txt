# Council Warns Law Violaters
## 
### 
Traffic violators were dealt with
by Women's Council in its first meet
ing, held yesterday. The council
issued a warning concerning parking
in "no parking" zones, and made it
emphatic that traffic tags ax - e being
given out freely.
Garage excuses for lockouts—that
is, excuses signed by garages to tes
tify that car trouble was had—will
not be arbitrarily accepted as valid
excuses this year. However, if they
arc useful in explaining the situa
tion, they may be presented.
The main policy of the council this
year is to try to apply and use the
Honor Code in regard to social regu
lations, more so than in the past,
according to Peg Schaeffer, chair
man.
Council will hold its regular meet
ing next Wednesday, when two new
members, yet to be selected, will be
present.
