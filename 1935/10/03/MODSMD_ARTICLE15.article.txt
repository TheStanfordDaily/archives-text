# Round Table Group Tells Year's Aims
## 
### 
Members of the Round Table Con
ference on Student Problems met at
1 o'clock yesterday in the Union to
outline tentative plans for the quar
ter.
Some of the first issues to be
brought before the group, according
to A.S.S.U. President Wally Brooke,
will be the efficiency of the Ex Com
mittee in filling the need for a stu
dent control group, student-faculty
relations and how they can be pro
moted, and Daily-Ex Committee
relations; that is, the extent of cen
sorship possible for Ex Committee
over Daily affairs.
The original plan to give one unit
of credit for the conference is to
be abandoned for the quarter at
least, but will probably be resumed
later.
Members (jf the Round Table are
Wally Brooke, A.S.S.U. president;
Jacqueline Flanders, A.S.S.U. vice
president; Peggy Schaeffer, presi
dent of Women's Conference; Bob

graduate members of Ex Committee,

be selected; two seniors, Jean An
derson and Bobby Grayson; Bob
Jones, Daily editor; Dean Mary Yost;
