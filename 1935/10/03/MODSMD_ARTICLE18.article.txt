# Mud Fighters Map Strategy
## 
### 
The traditional sophomore-fresh- i
man mud fight will be held this i
afternoon at 3:30 o'clock on the j
freshman football field.
Battle councils and plans of strat- I
egy were brought to a close last
night by the frosh class under the
leadership of Phil Zonne, lanky bas
ketball star and team captain.
The rules for the battle are simple.
At each end of the field is a pit filled
with 18 inches of muddy water,
one belonging to the sophs and the j
other to the "thirty-niners." It is j
the purpose of the battle for each
side to see how many members of t
j the opposition they can place in j
i their respective pits. After a man
has been "dunked" in a pit once, he '
is supposedly out of the fight. The j
roped off arena is to be 30 feet wide. I
; Contestants are not, according to j
| authorities ,to be permitted the use
of lethal weapons.
The sophomore class has been
spending a number of weeks this
year in organizing their class and
spreading "war fever" under the
leadership of Guy Haggarty, in an
attempt to get the Row men and the
j Hall men together.
