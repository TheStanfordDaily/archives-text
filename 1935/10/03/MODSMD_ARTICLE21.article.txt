I can't be half as nutty as students at

I Proving that they do is the result
of a survey conducted there by 123

mannerisms of 112 professors for
two weeks, then tabulated the an

"To find such obvious annoying
habits in one or two college profes
sors is not surprising," Mr. Moore
states, "but when one finds numer
ous annoying habits in a large per
cent of college faculty, one can
realize the great distracting power
I those little habits have."
At the southern college, pet ex
j pressions are so obvious and annoy
ing that students wagered on how
i often a certain professor would use

his "special net" during a lecture
period. One record showed an ex
pression 200 times over a two-week
period, Dr. Moore revealed.

The Carolina psych department
figured that the faculty was wrong
on only 25 possible points, but when
the results of the survey were tab
! ulated, students had found 63 addi
tional annoying habits and manner
| isms.
| The results were strictly straight
goods, Mr. Moore assured his col
leagues. Each student was cautioned
not to include habits that did not
annoy him personally, and urged to
keep as objective an attitude'as
possible. Naturally, the professorial
guinea pigs didn't see the results.

"To find such obvious annoying
habits in one or two college profes
sors is not surprising," Mr. Moore
states, "but when one finds numer
ous annoying habits in a large per
cent of college faculty, one can
realize the great distracting power
I those little habits have."
At the southern college, pet ex
j pressions are so obvious and annoy
ing that students wagered on how
i often a certain professor would use

his "special net" during a lecture
period. One record showed an ex
pression 200 times over a two-week
period, Dr. Moore revealed.

figured that the faculty was wrong

the results of the survey were tab

goods, Mr. Moore assured his col
leagues. Each student was cautioned
not to include habits that did not
annoy him personally, and urged to
keep as objective an attitude'as
possible. Naturally, the professorial
