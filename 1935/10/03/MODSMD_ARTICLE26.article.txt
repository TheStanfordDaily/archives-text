# B.A.C. Bans Indian Game With Gaels
## Appropriates Funds For Sending Band South To S.C. Contest 
### 
Stanford will not play St. Mary's.
So it was decreed at last night's
regular meeting of the Board of
Athletic Control.
The reason: Stanford's schedule is
already sufficiently filled and as
such, the game cannot possible be
arranged.
Since the existing petition request
ing such a meeting had not been
submitted to the secretary for action
of the board, it was not on the eve
ning's docket of business and there
fore could receive no action.
For that reason the board main
tained its decision already reached
last spring that Stanford would not
play St. Mary's but agreed that if a
well patronized petition for any
other game were properly filed with
the secretary before the next meet
ing, Octboer 30, it would receive at
tention.
Most important of the other busi
ness, which is subject to the ap
proval of Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur,
is the appropriation of $1200 for
transportation of the Stanford Band
to the U.S.C. game on November 9.
It was planned that the sum would
be sufficient to take 70 men to Los
Angeles and return.
