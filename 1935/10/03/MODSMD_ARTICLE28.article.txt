# Papoose Debators Hold Practice Tilt
## 
### 
Frosh debating starts a promising
season tonight with a practice con
test between members of the squad
on the question: "Resolved, that
federal relief program is detrimental
to social conditions." The contest is
to be held in Room 201 at 7:30
o'clock.
According to Bob Hartmann, team
manager, the outlook for the season
is brightened by the turnout of many
prep school champions, already vet
erans of the game. At present 18
men have applied, but a larger num
ber is expected.
