# Light Backfield To Carry Load In U.S.F. Game
## Alustiza, Coffis, Paulman, Vigna Will See Duty At Back Posts Boomer, Bones Out Team Shows Up Well In Long Scrimmage 
### 
Granting that all-Americans
Grayson and Hamilton will not start
against U.S.F. Saturday, Coach Tiny
Thornhill issued yesterday a memo
randum to the effect that he will,
chances are, start a "little giant"
backfield.
This little giant backfield will
have Frank Alustiza at full, Bill
Paulman at quarter, Jimmy Cof
fis at left half, and Joe Vigna
calling plays at right half.
Call the quartet "little giant" be
cause they average no more than 5
feet 8 inches in height and 185
pounds in weight. Now these figures
practically scream that there Is a lot
of stockiness in the little giant back
field, and into all the stockiness
there is almost a Rose Bowl's worth
of speed, deception, and power, be
sides two good passers and punters.
Grayson Out
The report yesterday had Gray
son, although out and running
around in full grid panoply, as hav
ing very slim chances of playing
Saturday. It is too much of a risk
on the ail-American ankle tendons
while regarding more important
| games to come, to use the boomer so
soon. But Tiny didn't say absolutely
that he would not play, if needed,
! either.
Hamilton and Adams both got a
one-way ticket out of the hospital,
but here, too, whether either will
play or not is a moot question.
Getting back, however, the little
giant backfield looked hot in a scrim
mage with the third string yester
day, late into the evening under the
| floodlights. Alustiza would dart
j through a hole at center for 10 yards,
Coffis would get away around tackle
for 20, Vigna would gain around th"
other tackle and Paulman would
l knock off another five.
Group Has Flash
Lacking, of course, were Grayson's
terrific slants and his splendid
passing of last week, and Hamilton's
gains and blocking, but the new unit
; showed flash %nd drive in the quar
terback sneaks of Alustiza and Cof
j fis' squirming tactics off tackle.
The quartet of little giants will
not be the only backfield in the game
Saturday, though. The varsity went
through a tough defensive scrim
mage last night., preparing for the
powerful onslaughts, so they say, of
Dons Mike Macciarini, Sal Seeno,
lean and fast, and Big Bill Petersen,
| as well as the strength of their man
[Lettlow at tackle.

Lacking, of course, were Grayson's
terrific slants and his splendid
passing of last week, and Hamilton's
gains and blocking, but the new unit
; showed flash %nd drive in the quar
terback sneaks of Alustiza and Cof
j fis' squirming tactics off tackle.
The quartet of little giants will
not be the only backfield in the game
Saturday, though. The varsity went
through a tough defensive scrim
mage last night., preparing for the
powerful onslaughts, so they say, of
Dons Mike Macciarini, Sal Seeno,
lean and fast, and Big Bill Petersen,
| as well as the strength of their man
[Lettlow at tackle.
Granting that all-Americans
Grayson and Hamilton will not start
against U.S.F. Saturday, Coach Tiny
Thornhill issued yesterday a memo
randum to the effect that he will,
chances are, start a "little giant"
backfield.
This little giant backfield will
have Frank Alustiza at full, Bill
Paulman at quarter, Jimmy Cof
fis at left half, and Joe Vigna
calling plays at right half.
Call the quartet "little giant" be
cause they average no more than 5
feet 8 inches in height and 185
pounds in weight. Now these figures
practically scream that there Is a lot
of stockiness in the little giant back
field, and into all the stockiness
there is almost a Rose Bowl's worth
of speed, deception, and power, be
sides two good passers and punters.
Grayson Out
The report yesterday had Gray
son, although out and running
around in full grid panoply, as hav
ing very slim chances of playing
Saturday. It is too much of a risk
on the ail-American ankle tendons
while regarding more important
| games to come, to use the boomer so
soon. But Tiny didn't say absolutely
that he would not play, if needed,
! either.
Hamilton and Adams both got a
one-way ticket out of the hospital,
but here, too, whether either will
play or not is a moot question.
Getting back, however, the little
giant backfield looked hot in a scrim
mage with the third string yester
day, late into the evening under the
| floodlights. Alustiza would dart
j through a hole at center for 10 yards,
Coffis would get away around tackle
for 20, Vigna would gain around th"
other tackle and Paulman would
l knock off another five.
Group Has Flash
