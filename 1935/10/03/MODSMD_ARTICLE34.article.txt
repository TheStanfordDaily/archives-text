# Few Report For Freshman Track In First Practice
## 
### 
With a fervent prayer that it will
amount to more than is on deck at
present, Coach Bill Ellington starts
the 1935 edition of Stanford's frosh
track team into action this week.
An initial list of 16 candidates,
against a usual fall quarter turnout
of 30, seems rather ominous to Coach
Ellington. The entry list, however, is
by no means closed, and it is hoped
that any potential '39 talent, whether
with long high school pedigrees or
not, will report to Ellington's prac
tice sessions, the sooner the better.
Among those expected to be prom
inent in frosh track write-ups from
now on are: H. S. Taggart, former
Glendale high broad-jumper and tal
ented sprinter from last year's
Montezuma prep school team; Bill
Hawkins, Santa Ana high, point
winner in both hurdle races at the
c'li-Southern California meet last
spring; R. P. Kelly, Oakland sprint
er, said to be a 23-foot broad
jumper.
K. B. Thompson, capable sprinter
from Los Angeles; H. R. Soltera,
JOO- and 220-yard Montana state
prep champ last season; Pete Za
gar. now out for football, but ex
pected to give opposing discus men
a pain next spring; B. P. G. Smith,
a brother of Humbert, who is said
to have grasped some high jump
ing ability in the past season; and
J. M. Fuller, a 2:03 half-miler com
plete the early season roster.
Conspicuously absent from the
group is any long distance talent.
Men who have signed with El
lington to date are: Smith, Thomp
son. Johnson, Moran, Soltera, Kelly,
Slater, Feder, Giannini, Paulson,
Kane, Taggart, Wagner, Fuller,
Shaw, and Lynn.
