### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 2 (/P). â€” The
United States has played only a
minor role in supplying war muni
tions to Italy, figures tabulated here
j today showed, and has shipped none
to Ethiopia.
Airplane engines and parts sent to
Italy showed the only increase over
19.M and 1928, taken as typical pe
j riods.
Data on exports of articles desig
nated as "arms, munitions and im
[ plements of war," which must be
registered with the State Depart
ment under the neutrality act, were
made available to Secretary Hull.
The figures, Hull said, are unoffi
cial, but are believed to be accurate.
The department, he added, is not
in a position to keep an official rec
( ord of arms exports until after
November 29, when the licensing
system becomes effective.
