# 'Dark Tower' Is Choice Of Drama Council
## Woolcott, Kaufman Play To Be Given Nov. 1 
### 
"Dark Tower," by Alexander
Woolcott and George S. Kaufman
of Broadway and Hollywood fame,
will be the first presentation of the
Dramatic Council for this yeai\
The three-act play is an ingenious
melodrama which combined plot
with a double mystery and typical
Woolcott wit.
"Dark Tower" had a very success
ful and long run on Broadway last
season, and has also been filmed re
ently in Hollywood. It will be given
Friday, November 1, in the Assem
bly Hall. Although the new theater
will not be ready for use until next
fall, this year's dramatic activity is
not being impaired by lack of facil
ities.
