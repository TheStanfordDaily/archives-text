# Students Urge Eastern Game December 21
## Poor Weather Conditions Appear as Obstacle 
### 
The "schedule a post-season inter
sectional game for Stanford" move
ment suffered a setback and at the
same time started on a new course
yesterday as its supporters tried
every angle to achieve their purpose.
They now work toward a post
final examination game which could
be slated for December 21 on an
eastern grid, thus giving Stanford's
big red machine a chance to travel
east. And if a win .should result ; t
j would aid the Indians' chances to
| be ranked with the nation's best.
Principle objection to this latter
i plan seems to be the weather. At
j that late date most eastern fields
j will be either pools of mud or will
be snow covered unless unusually

good weather should prevail.
The old plans proposing a game to
be played here on December 7 suf
fered a severe setback yesterday
when members of the B A C. offered
the argument that too many other
games were scheduled for the bay
region that day.
