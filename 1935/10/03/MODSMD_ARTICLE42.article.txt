BUNN BRINGS NEWS
FROM SOUTHLAND
Scouting fuur opponents within p
24-hour period is u real job—Stan
ford's head scout, John Bunn,
knows.
Last week-end Bunn went south,
viewed U.C.L.A., U.S.C., Montana,
and U.S.C. frosh in action, and now
he's back on the Farm with a stack
of notes three feet high for Tiny
Thornhill to ponder over.
Bunn went to work on his first
job last Friday night when he saw
U.C.L.A. whip Cal Aggies, 39-0. For
our own information we asked him
a question about that Uclan squad.
"Did U.C.L.A. look good, coach?"
His answer didn't sound too en
couraging to a Stanford follower.
"Look good, heavens, they look
perfect." But Bunn didn't say
"heavens."
And then he went on to tell about
a fellow named Chuck Cheshire who
Wto the big gun for that Westwood
team. It seems they only played
Cheshire for one quarter and it was
during that time that they chalked
up 33 of their final 39 points. Bunn
says he's one of the finest halfbacks
he's seen.
They have another man, too, who
looked mighty good to our Indian
scout. Fred Funk is the monicker
and he's making a name for himself
by demonstrating the fact that the
shortest distance between two points
is a straight line. That's the way he
runs, straight as a die, and anyone
that gets in his way knows it. "He
has wonderful leg drive and push"
was the way scout Bunn put it.
HERE'S A RARITY
TROJANS COMPLIMENTED
Bui after hearing how well the
Westwood team looked, we shot a
question that we thought might
bring some happy news for Stan
iord. But again words of praise for
the southland lads.
Bunn is one of the few authori
ties to hand U.S.C. a compliment
this season. He tells us that the
Trojans looked smoother and bet
ter as a team than they did when
he watched them open their last
year's season.

He credited the low Trojan score,
9-0, primarily to the fact that they
were up against a brilliant defense.
| Here again came good words for
Stanford opponents, for that defense
| belonged to Montana.
He thought that the Montanans,
under their new coach, Doug Fes
senden, played about as fine a de
t fensive game as he had occasion to
see. —Frost
