# Frosh Show Strength In Water Polo
## Thornton Encouraged By Results of Season's Opening Game 
### 
Coach Nort Thornton is not at all
I dissatisfied with his frosh water
j poloists, even in consideration of the
i defeat they received Monday night
at the hands of the fast Athens Club
|
| reserves.
| The yearlings, Coach Thornton
I says, demonstrated a lot of promise
jin their season opener with the
i Athenians, inasmuch as they had
| only worked out five times before
| the game. In fact, the only serious
j fault Thornton finds with the men
[is that they are a little lacking in
j experience.
High hopes are held for John
Lamb, right forward, who seems to
j have possibilities as outstanding as
any freshman water poloist ever to
j enroll at Stanford. Lamb hails from
\ Los Angeles high school, where he
j earned a berth on the all-Southern
California prep school team.
Other prospects who have looked
good thus far include Left Guard
| Winfield Needham, junior national
' champ in the 500-yard free-srtyle;
| Lomax Turner, right guard, a ll
| American interscholastic sprint star
j from Long Beach; Jack Wilsom, left
: forward; and Bob Allen, sprint, all
jof whom are included in Coach
j Thornton's original line-up.
Tomorrow afternoon the squad
j tangles with Paly high school at the
iEncina pools.
