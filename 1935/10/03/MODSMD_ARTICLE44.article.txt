## 38 Remain On Soccer Squad Team Meets San Mateo In Season's Opener 
### 
With the first conference game,
â–  scheduled for October 10 with San
: Mateo J.C., the varsity soccer team
is beginning to round into shape and
I in scrimmage this week looked good
j with the exception of one or two
; kinks that are being ironed out by
| Coach Dick Bullis. Because the
j start of the season is so near, the
I large squad had to be cut early this
! week, with about 38 men surviving
i the slash.
| Barney Vierling was elected cap
tain for the 1935-36 season. Bill
Hatch and Paul Helms in addition
! to Vierling also have been looking
I good in daily scrimmages. Due to
injuries, Mike Gonzalez, a ball play
j er whom Bullis is counting on for a
! lot of service this year, has not come
! out yet but should recover soon and
be on the field in a couple of days.
Bullis announced that he has ap
' pointed Winstead Weaver and Dick
i Forhan as assistant coaches, the
| former to handle the duties of frosh
j coach and the latter to aid with the
i varsity.
Although it was necessary to cut
! the varsity squad at this time Bullis
j emphasized the fact that when spring
| turnouts start, any number of men
may come out.
