# Baseball Team Considers Trip
## 
### 
According to Harry Wolters, var-
I sity baseball coach, negotiations have
i been opened toward securing an in
vitation from the Big Six, Japanese
university baseball league, for a se
ries of games next summer.
While plans are still tentative, the
proposed trip would include a sched
ule of approximately 20 games with
the six Tokio universities which
comprise the country's leading ama-
I teur baseball league.
t The team would leave immc
-1 diately after the completion of the
spring quarter next year, in order
that scholastic duties might not in
! terfere.
This trip would return the compli
ment paid Pacific Coast nines a few
I years ago, when a member of the
i Japanese conference journeyed here
| to play them. It would also replace
to some extent the eastern trip
planned for last year which was
abandoned because of unforeseen
| difficulties.
