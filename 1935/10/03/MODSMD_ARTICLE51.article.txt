# Frosh Gridders Smooth Attack
## Poor Blocking Revealed As Biggest Weakness 
### 
Still not satisfied with the per
formance of his Papoose machine.
Coach Jimmy Bradshaw put his
charges through another scrimmage
last night in an effort to iron out a
ragged attack. The greatest weak
ness seems to be ineffective blocking.
Time after time, the defensive
tackles charged in over a prostrate
end who should have been on top of
the tackle. Unless this department
of the games is speadily improved,
the frosh will NOT score on the
heavy Sacramento J.C. line.
When he got any kind of block
ing, Huebel looked mighty nice at
lefi half. He tore off several long
gains, each time shaking himself
loose from would-be tacklers.
Wally deWitt, hefty fullback,
looks good plunging through the
line, but the quality of the defenses
makes it hard to tell whether the
first-string is really bad or whether
the reserves are mighty good. It
could be the latter. There is certainly
a wealth of defensive line material.
So much, in fact, that Coach Brad
shaw may have a hard time picking
a combination.
He has five first-class ends, Butt
ler, Saunders, Noll, Hege, and
Stojkovich. At the tackle posts are
Zagar, Carnahan, J. West, B. West,
Hartzell, and Beckley. For guards,
McMillan, Gustafson, Shreve, Davis,
Crow, and Campbell. Sutton, Gui
berson, and Mecia are battling for
the center post, with the last named
having a good chance to hit the first
string in the pear future.
It would seem that the only one of
that group that has a place cinched
is big Pete Zagar, who runs a mile
around the field every night before
practice begins. He apparently has
everything a good tackle needs, in
cluding a desire for hard work.
The backfield is somewhat of a
problem, for Bradshaw must find a
combination that will click from
such as Huebel, deWitt, Gamier,
Kirsch, Hawkins, Jordan, Fay Veen
ker, Maino, and Grubbs. Of these
men, the first three seem to be ready
for the fray Saturday, but Kirsch.
Hawkins, and Grubbs have been al
ternating at the remaining halfback
I post Grubbs seems to be favored at
the moment.
