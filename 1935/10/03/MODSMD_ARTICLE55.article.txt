TO WE, 111., Oct. 2 (/P). —Fires are
not frequent in this village of 300
persons and so when the "keeper of
the keys" to the antiquated fire
truck left for a short vacation no
one thought anything of it.
But when D. W. Closser's home
caught fire, volunteers had to push
the truck to the scene. Then a
mechanic wired around the switch to
permit use of a motor driven pump.
Meanwhile the house burned
down.
