# Changes Made in the Daily With Eye to Improvement
## 
### 
[n the editor's mail this morning is a letter
calling lor a reason tor the changing of the
name "Campus Opinion," long the title of the
Daily's best-read feature, and for the append
ing of editorial notes to these campus letters.
"Vox Campi" replaces "Campus Opinion"
as a title and a feature to give to the Daily an
individuality in its column of student opinion
that seems lacking in practically every other
college paper which has a campus opinion
section.
Editor's notes at the end of each com muni
cation add a certain punch to the opinions
and remind the campus that the letters do not
necessarily express the opinion of the Daily.
Moreover, contentions in campus letters are
often one-sided, not to say grossly overstated.
Since answers either run a day or two later,
or not at all, hut seldom side-by-side, an ap
pendage reminding readers of the existence
of another side can scarcely he amiss.
Third new feature of the revamped opinion
column is the Daily's reservation of the right
to cut contributions which are over-lengthy.
This, however, cannot be classified as entirely
new since the Daily has always claimed a
space limitation on these contributions.
Not from a desire to slash at random, but
from a desire to keep the contents of "Vox
Campi" short, informative, and entertaining
arises the newly expressed right to delete.
For these reasons the revamped column
lakes its place along with the other changes
and additions in the new make-up of the
Daily.
