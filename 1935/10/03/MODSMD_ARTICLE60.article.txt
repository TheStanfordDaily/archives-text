# Prosperity Even Reaches Down to the Rough's Level
##

Navin Field in Detroit yesterday was
packed with 48,700 baseball tans for the
opening game of the World Series. Nine days
ago 90,000 individuals provided the first mil
lion-dollar prize-lighting gate since the hectic
prc-deprcssion days. American citizens ob
viously have again taken up their old habit
of spending.
Stanford has been one of the first to show
signs of this boost in expenditure. Indications
of this prosperity are evident on all sides,
(lampiis police report a huge gain in the num
ber of cars on the Farm this year; Palo Alto
garages will testify as to the percentage of
new autos being driven by students and pro
fessors alike. The record enrollment this
quarter, particularly in a school that requires
$11.") a throw, is good proof of the increased
tendency to spend. The great number of stu
dents who took leaves of absence two or three
years ago and have returned this fall further
corroborates the prosperity-is-here premise.
The Administration should do well this

year. And so, incidentally, should the Board
of Athletic Control during the current foot
ball season. Sport-hungry radio listeners of
the past, as demonstrated in the World Series
and the Louis-Baer tight, are beginning to
make personal appearances at their favorite
events again.
These evidences of 1915.") prosperity, fur
thermore. seemingly refute the statement that
Stanford, this year an ideal gridiron drawing
power throughout the country, could not
make a financial success on a post-season
game with a major Eastern opponent.
