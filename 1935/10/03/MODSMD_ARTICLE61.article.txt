The battle rages. Recriminations, counter-charges,
and fur are now flying back and forth in "Vox Campi"
upon the subject of the "terrific" freshman women.
Since Our Hasher is commonly considei-ed a pam
pered and spoiled egg, more than slightly cracked, he
cannot retire back into his shell, even though the con
flict may bore our more distinguished readers, inter
ested only in the ennobling aspects of Our Hasher's
program for the well-rounded cultural education.
Judging from the ovation accorded Our Hasher by
Roble women in the public prints, this year's crop of
women have the true Stanford Indian spirit — the
battle-axes.
I admire your spunk,
Your thesis was punk
Your quips were the bunk,
Your reasoning stunk.
Health—up; metabolism—and up; soul —sensitive;
funk—blue.
Miss M.H.. '39, this morning denies that Stanford
women should use all the arts of civilization to make
themselves attractive, elusive, charming, glamorous,
and terrific. She forgets that the only reason that a
Stanford woman comes to Stanford is to be attractive,
elusive, charming, glamorous, terrific, and to give jobs
to deserving hashers (and sometimes marry one).
Our Hasher, '37, being of a religious turn, warns
the wreck of the '30 (or was it the 97), that one can
not overlook either the pleasures of the soul or the
flesh, particularly when it walks past you on the Quad.
("It" having no particular antecedent).
Our Hasher. '37, being of a turn, also states that ho
learns to appreciate women who do not write campus
opinions.
