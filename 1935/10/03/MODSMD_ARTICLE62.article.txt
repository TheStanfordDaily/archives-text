A "proposed" Stanford-St. Mary's football
game on October 19 is completely out of
the question. This fact was made plain at the
Hoard of Athletic Control last night, thus
dispelling any lingering hopes on the part of
sponsors of a long-concealed petition, which
finally made its appearance on Quad and
living group bulletin boards yesterday.
The petition, cloaked in mystery and rumor
until its long-awaited appearance on the cam
pus, was not presented at the Board meeting;
hence, the B.A.C. merely accepted the facts
laid before it in a statement by Graduate Man
ager A! Masters, and did not feel called upon
to take up the question ollicially—the pro
posed game was obviously impossible.
