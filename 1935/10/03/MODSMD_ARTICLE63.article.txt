## CITY NEIGHBORS 
### 
Consider the aged Row ... 24 fraternities and nine
sororities . . . located for the most part side by side
. . . yet aloof from one another as the trees that front
them . . . City neighbors.
* * * *
Little less than notorious is the saying that the
Smiths living on Fifty-second avenue in Cincinnati,
Louisville, or San Francisco are barely on speaking
terms with the Jonses who live right next door. Just
a little less notorious has come to be the fact that
members of the different Greek houses at Stanford
are on less amicable terms than are their respective
cooks.
# * * *
The Smiths and the Joneses are big city residents.
They don't work at the same places, belong to the same
clubs, aren't necessarily of the same social standing,
don't spend much time at home, and there really isn't
much reason to expect that they should call each other
by their first names and spend the evenings sitting
on each other's porches.
# * * Jfc
The fraternities and sororities, on the other hand,
are rural residents. They're down here on the Farm.
Their members go to school in the same buildings,
belong to the same student body and to many of the
same organizations and teams, spend a great deal of
time at home, and are, in spite of the state of mind of
a certain few, of exactly the same social standing.
Their interests are of such a mutual nature that there
is every reason to expect they should know one an
other by name and even warm chairs on their neigh
bors' porches.
* * * *
Various unfortunate circumstances down through
the years have led to the estrangement of some of the
Greek factions. In one case the Xi Chi Delta boys
might have aroused the ire of the Tri Beta girls by
persistently playing soft ball on their neighbor's lawn.
In another the Psi Chi's might have declared a state
of feud because they figured the Xi Thetas pulled
some dirty rushing against them. But whenever one
considers just why one house is not on good terms with
another, he has a hard time trying to find a justifiable
reason.
* # * *
Now that the Interfraternity Board of Control and
Panhellenic leaders have apparently seen the light in
matters of rushing freshmen and initiating sopho
mores, it. is high time to call an inter-house get-ac
quainted period where the members of different
groups can be invited around to see how those strange
persons they pass every day at the post office act when
they are at home.

The fraternities and sororities, on the other hand,
are rural residents. They're down here on the Farm.
Their members go to school in the same buildings,
belong to the same student body and to many of the
same organizations and teams, spend a great deal of
time at home, and are, in spite of the state of mind of
a certain few, of exactly the same social standing.
Their interests are of such a mutual nature that there
is every reason to expect they should know one an
other by name and even warm chairs on their neigh
bors' porches.

Various unfortunate circumstances down through
the years have led to the estrangement of some of the
Greek factions. In one case the Xi Chi Delta boys
might have aroused the ire of the Tri Beta girls by
persistently playing soft ball on their neighbor's lawn.
In another the Psi Chi's might have declared a state
of feud because they figured the Xi Thetas pulled
some dirty rushing against them. But whenever one
considers just why one house is not on good terms with
another, he has a hard time trying to find a justifiable
reason.

Now that the Interfraternity Board of Control and
Panhellenic leaders have apparently seen the light in
matters of rushing freshmen and initiating sopho
mores, it. is high time to call an inter-house get-ac
quainted period where the members of different
groups can be invited around to see how those strange
persons they pass every day at the post office act when
they are at home.

Consider the aged Row ... 24 fraternities and nine
sororities . . . located for the most part side by side
. . . yet aloof from one another as the trees that front
them . . . City neighbors.

Little less than notorious is the saying that the
Smiths living on Fifty-second avenue in Cincinnati,
Louisville, or San Francisco are barely on speaking
terms with the Jonses who live right next door. Just
a little less notorious has come to be the fact that
members of the different Greek houses at Stanford
are on less amicable terms than are their respective
cooks.

The Smiths and the Joneses are big city residents.
They don't work at the same places, belong to the same
clubs, aren't necessarily of the same social standing,
don't spend much time at home, and there really isn't
much reason to expect that they should call each other
by their first names and spend the evenings sitting
on each other's porches.
