# SUBSIDIZING ATHLETES
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
There is a question concerning
athletes that is continually popping
up in bull sessions around the Farm.
Namely, the top is, should the uni
versities openly subsidize their ath
letes.
At Stanford there are a number
of valid arguments in favor of such
a policy. At the same time it is ob
vious that Stanford individually can
not adopt the policy. In a spirit of
fair play to those athletes partially
or wholly self-supporting, I ask
consideration of this problem by the
liberal-minded students of the Uni
versity.
