# MAYBE. WHO KNOWS?

The Editor, Sir:
I wish the campus to know that I
am serious about this Stanford-Gael
game petition.
My aides and I believe that the
majority of Farm students want this
game. It is our desire through this
petition to enable them to give voice
to their desire for a really big foot
ball game. Alumni of my acquaint
ance favor rather than oppose this
game.
Today I have made my petition
available to all living groups on the
campus.

The campus finally gets a chancc
to look at these much-rumored
petitions.â€”Ed.
