The Editor, Sir:
What's happened to the old Cam
pus Opinion column? The other day,
while looking through a strange
Daily, all we could find along that
line was something called Vox Pop,
Vox Campi, or something. Why not
call it Vox Editorus as the "thing"
was overflowing with sarcastic edi
torial comments?
It's getting so that a serious gripe
is getting turned into a silly joke.
We thought this column was for the
students, and, as the editor already
has a column, why can't he stick
to it?
Yours for an old-fashioned Cam
pus Opinion,
Sam Fi'eeman
Jim Cayton
P.S.: Please go easy with the Ed.
