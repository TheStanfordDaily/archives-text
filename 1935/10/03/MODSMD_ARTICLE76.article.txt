### THE CO-ED SHOPPER 
October 3
Dear Diary: There's so much to
tell I hardly know where to start,
but I s'pose the New Man comes
first Sunday night supper. He sorta
fer from Yale and I met him at our
first Sunlay night supper. He sorta
fell. I'm blaming it on my new per
manent—l've almost fooled myself
the curls are my own, they're so
natural looking. But actually they're
from the new Frederics permanent
machine at LYDIA'S, 460 Univer
sity. More news is that I'm chair
man of the house's flower commit
tee, but that's an easy job since I
know about THE FLOWER SHOP,
175 University. I've already bought
a graceful iron wall bracket with
little yellow pots filled with trailing
ivy for the hall. Now about Jerry,
who beaued me around until I met
Ted—the New Man, of course. Poor
Jerry's last act of devotion was the
most adorable compact — in blue
snakeskin with a real feather puff.
It couldn't have come from any
where but the DE LEMOS STUDIO,
520 Ramona. Jerry's out of the pic
ture now, and I've been shopping
for my first big date with Ted.
We're going to the S.F.U. game in
the city Saturday, then to dinner
and other places later. I found the
perfect costume at MARY ELIZA
BETH'S, 119 University. It's a one
piece dress in a warm tan made of
soft corded rabbit hair. The trim at
the belt and throat is green and

copper elephant ornaments. With
this I'm wearing the most divine
camel's hair swagger in a rich plaid
and a smart hat I found at this swell
shop. It's a matching brown with a
darker trim of leather that's very
cleverly laced across the top of the
crown like a football. My stockings
are in that grand brownish tone
called Durbar that Gatham Gold
Strip puts out. They're very sheer
and I got them at MARIAN SEI
MAS', 534 Ramona. The shoes are
the new tie-pump that's not too
dressy for football. They're the pride
of the WALK-OVER, 220 Univer
sity, in brown suede with aligator
trim. I moaned to the room-mate
how I hate a heavy perfume for out
door things, and she rushed me to
the UNIVERSITY PHARMACY, 134
University, for Tweed, the Lentheric
scent for sports. In return for this
favor, I bought the room an alarm
clock at BAKER S, 571 Ramona, and
we've been getting to our eight
o'elycks on time for a change. An
other good deed for this week was
tipping off a football player who sits
j next to me in Econ about the AS-:
SOCIATED STENOGRAPHERS, 26G
University. He has a sprained finger
' and can't write his papers, and I
knew he'd like their typing. Mother
just sent me a wonderful portrait of
Dad and I am having it framed at
WIGHTMAN'S, 366 University—they
do fine work and I'm in hopes of
having a photo of Ted for them to
frame in the very near future! (adv.)
