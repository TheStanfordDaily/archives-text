# Severe Crisis Looms on City Embarcadero
## Pickets Off Point Clear, Hot Cargo Vessel Of Waterfront Freighters Tied Up Conference To Be Held Under U.S. Judge 
### 
(Special to The Daily)
Lack of longshoremen along the
San Francisco waterfront menaces
with the possibility of the tie-up of
every ship in the harbor during the
coming week. At present 34 out of
the 49 .ships are out of commission.
Tension along the Embarcadero
was heightened rather than relieved
when pickots were withdrawn yes
terday from the Point Clear, Ca
nadian freighter, which has been
the focal point of waterfront dis
putes for over three months. The
Point Clear was condemned by the
I.L.A. for carrying "hot" cargo from
strikebound Canadian ports, and
was the first vessel actively con
cerned in the controversy.
While the number of available
longshoremen is not actually de
pleted, under the arbitration
award, men should not work more
than 120 hours per month, and the
few falling within this quota have
already been snapped up. Those
on the inactive list at present will
not be free for work until Octo
ber 14.
Negotiations are taking the form
of further conferences among ship
ping heads and maritime employers.
The bargemen have voted to hear
their differences with the River
Lines operators before Judge Sloss,
federal arbitrator on hiring hall dis
putes between employers and un
ions. The Waterfront Employers
Association, because of this situa
tion, will ask Judge Sloss to author
ize drafting of 1000 non-union wat
erfront workers.
Hiring hall disturbances came
forward yesterday, during trial of
the case, when I.L.A. President
Harry Bridges charged employers
with shipping men against rulings
of the joint labor relations board,
and employers retaliated by ac
cusing the I.L.A. of introducing
physical violence in dispatching
halls.
Further complications arose in
face of the "ultimatum" of Edwin
McGrady, assistant secretary of la
bor, who came out Wednesday night
with the statement that the unions
"as honorable men" were obliged to
work "hot" cargo, including that
from British Columbia.
Pacific Steamship Lines, Inc., who
have already suspended operations
of their passenger service, an
nounced their intentions Wednesday
of doing the same with their cargo
steamers until the situation is re
lieved.
