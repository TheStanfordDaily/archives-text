ADDIS ABABA, Oct. 3 (A>). —
Italy bombed the Ethiopian town of
Aduwa in a swift surprise aerial
raid Thursday, killing and wounding
over 1700. The long-awaited war in
East Africa was unofficially under
way.
Haile Selassie proclaimed a gen -
eral mobilization calling 10,000,000
warriors to the colors. The emperor
then telegraphed a full report and
protest of the incident to the League
ol Nations. He asserted that Red
Cross hospitals, housing sick and in
jured were the targets of the Ital
ians' bombs, and appealed to world
opinion for condemnation of such
Lactics.
Italy Admits B«mbs
After previous denials, Italy ad
mitted the bombardment Thursday
night but said it was in reprisal for
an artillery attack upon a recon
noitering border aerial squadron.
Ethiopians believed inhabitants
were not warned of the bombing and
that its purpose was to invite re
prisals on Italian territory in an at
tempt to justify invasion by the
latter.
Fight at Aduwa
Fighting was reported under way
in the region between Aduwa and
Eritrea. The Reuters correspondent
stated that Italians were retreating
in that section. A government an
nouncement understood Mussolini's
troops to be in complete occupation
of Aduwa. It added that 15 houses
in this town and 100 in Adigrat had
been completely destroyed.
Luigi Vinci-Gigluicci, Italian min
ister to Ethiopia, was presented with
his passports a few hours after the
report of the air raid. He will leave
tomorrow.
