# Il Duce Army Moves Against Ethiop Troops
## 
### 
ROME, Oct. 3 (^P). â€”Italy's mod
ern, well-trained army swept into
1 ancient Ethiopia today to meet the
! tribesmen of Emperor Haile Selassie,
j Strong positions have been taken
j up, the government announced.
; Thus far there has been no mention
' here of fighting, reported in African
| dispatches.
Italy intends to carry out her pro
gram without any declaration of war
because officials call it a "colonial
1 affair." Ethiopia's general mobiliza
-1 tion, however, was considered creat
, ing a virtual state of war, whether
Emperor Haile Selassie makes a
! formal declaration of war or not.
Overnight, the eager Italian
I troops crossed the border v/here yes
i terday small Ethiopian outposts were
j reported.
Bombers Aid Troops
The "desperate" bomb squadron
! commanded by Count Galeazzo
Ciano, son-in-law of Premier Mus
solini, with Vittorio Mussolini, son
of the premier, as one of his pilots,
| has been active along the line and
! may have led the advance in the air.
Aduwa, where Italians were
crushed in 1895, a memory which
! rankles here, lies only a short dis
! tance ahead. (Addis Ababa dis
patches said Aduwa was bombed by
Italian planes with civilian losses.)
Aduwa Ducc's Goal
I Aduwa is one of the moral goals
of Italy, for Italians say the scene
; of their defeat must be the scene of
! their victory. Mussolini, speaking of
j Ethiopia's "aggression" said yester
day to millions in the test mobiliza
! tion, "We have been patient for 40
! years. That is enough."
The Italian public received news
| of the advance with complete calm.
1 Special editions with big headlines
1 announced the long-awaited action.
There were no manifestations.
A guard of 50 Carabineers was sta
tioned around the Ethiopian lega
; tion to prevent a possible outbreak
'of popular feeling. The Ethiopian
| charge d'affaires, Jesus Negadras
! Afevort, is not allowed to receive
communications and thus is ignorant
of developments in Ethiopia.
