# Yearlings Out-Dunk Sophs in Mud fight
## 
### BILL MACKINTOSH 
War fever, which was spread i
about the campus Wednesday nignt
in the form of numerous flying to
matoes, many scoring direct hits,
provided a very suitable back- |
ground for the traditional fre.shman
sophomore mud fight won yesterday
afternoon by the frosh class.
Led onto the field of battle by
their lanky leader. Phil Zonne, amid
the cheers of their many support
ers, the frosh spent several minutes
planning an attack before the zero
hour. Captain Zonne formed his
men near the frosh end of the field
dividing his forces into an attacking
party and a reserve group. As tho
gun was fired the remaining peaches
and tomatoes left over from the
ninht before were hurled by the coa
ic.slanLs and the "thirty-niners" bt

gan to "dunk" their way to an over
whelming victory. Although the
sophomores, under the able direc
tion of Captain Guy Haggerty,
fought valiantly, they were outnum
bered as usual. This, coupled to the
fact that they seemed out maneuver
ed. contributed largely to the soph
defeat.
After the presentation of the silver
loving cup to the victorious class,
an attempt was made by some nf
the frosh to immerse Sponsor Bill
Woodard. A rescuing squad of up
perclassmen formed a color guard,
however, and saved their fellow of
ficial from a muddy bath.
Among the more seriously injured
of the contestants were William
Swett, '39, broken nose and lacera
tions. and Stub Hatch, '39, wlx> suf
fered a sprained ankle.
