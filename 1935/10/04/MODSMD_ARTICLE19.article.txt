# Production Of Farce Amuses
## 
### Eleanore Jansen 
To an attentive and amused audi
ence in the Assembly Hall last night,
it was proved that a French play
well produced could be amusing
even to those not following the dia
logue perfectly.
Elaborate pantomime made the
spirit and the humor of the play,
"Les Precieuses Ridicules," evident
to even the dullest members of the
audience. At least, most of the au
dience knew where to laugh with
out imitating too slavishly the reac
tions of the persons sitting next to
them.
The cast included William Rulon
Brockbank, Alan F. Blair, Henri C.
Charpiot, Helen Mears, Irene Os
mond, Jeanne Melton, George Wood,
Rudy Holtermann, Howard Gates,
Richard Rathman, George Grinnell,
Elizabeth Camm, Kay Arthur, Jane
Bauder, Jacqueline Flanders, Ruth
Nutting, Donald Blackmarr, Myron
Birnbaum, Dred Kimball, M. Le
Rougeaud, and M. La Porte.
The play was produced under the
general direction of Dr. William L.
Schwartz, associate professor of Ro
manic languages, and the scenes
were constructed by Phil Brown
and the members of the Theater
Workshop.
