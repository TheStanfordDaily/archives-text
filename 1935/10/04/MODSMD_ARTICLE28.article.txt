# Hume Speaks About Orient
## 
### 
Stressing the necessity of help j
from students in bridging over the |
many anisunderstandings prevalent
between America and the Orient,
Dr. Edward H. Hume, medical au- |
thority from China, spoke before the i
all-University assembly yesterday '
morning on the topic "New Bridges j
to the Orient."
Hume spoke of the commercial
bridges, crossed in early days, which ;
were instrumental in introducing j
products of China's ancient culture j
to Western civilization. Voyages
made over a century ago brought to ;
Spain, for the first time, oranges and
grapefruit and laid the foundation
for the missionary system.
Hume granted that these things !
have increased the spirit of under
standing between countries, but he j
made it clear that they must be
supplemented. "New bridges are
needed," he said. "New highways
and bridges of the spirit."
One outsanding point of misunder
standing the lecturer spoke of was
the Western emphasis on literacy.
He pointed out that the Eastern
peoples did not consider the ability
to read and write important.
