# 'Pony' Backs To Start Tomorrow's Contest In Kezar
## Grayson, Hamilton, Adams, Topping To View Tilt from Sidelines; S.F. Team Provides Stiff Competition for Indians 
### GORDY FROST 
Today they're asking questions about Stanford's pony backficld.
Tomorrow their queries will all be answered.
Tor tomorrow afternoon against the University of San Francisco
Dons, Head Coach Claude E. "Tiny" Thornhill sends a new backficld
combination of Stanford Indians on the Kezar Stadium grid. A combina
tion of small, fast, tricky men, all but one untested in tough competition.

It's all a part of Tiny's plan to
keep two injured backfield men on
the bench and start the next best
combination. So it will be veteran
Frank Alustiza at full, Bill Paulman
at quarter, Jimmy Coffis at left half,
and Joe Vigna calling signals from
his post at right half.
And this will let regular fullback
All-American Bobby Grayson and
Bones Hamilton sit on the sidelines
when the opening whistle blows and
perhaps all the time, if the new
quartet can handle the situation.
Black, Olcott To Play
Two other injured first stringers,
tackle Woody Adams and Keith
Topping, will be watching from the
side, too, and in their open spots
will be Bob Black and sophomore
Chet Olcott.
The rest of the line will start in
tact. But as was the case last year,
Thornhill is still undecided between
Alt' Brandin and Wes Muller at cen
ter. Tomorrow he'll probably start
Wes.
Thus Stanford goes into its second
game of the season tomorrow minus
four first stringers but with the va
cated spots filled with capable,
promising men.
Backfield Powerful
It'll take that kind of players to
handle U.S.F., too. Though Stan
ford receives the vote to come out
on top, U.S.R has a powerful, fast
backfield and a none-too-weak line
to make things just a trifle difficult
for a gang of Indians.
They're supposed to have a Bac
ciarini who can pass, and Seeno and
Pucci and Peterson who can drive,
and a Prentiss Wells who can run
like lightning.
On the line they're weaker, but
the last time they were seen in
action was last Saturday, and a lot
could be done with a ragged line in
seven days' time. They've got a
Blewitt, their captain, and a Letlow,
reputedly mighty tough gents, to
build that line around.
Coffis May Be Star
There's a little fellow starting for
Stanford who's going to keep that
line and those backs busy, though.
That's Jimmy Coffis.
Last week he looked like a million
in scrimmage, ran through the
whole second team, intercepted
passes, stole the show. He stands
only five feet six inches, weighs 172,
but has the mettle of another War
burton.
The other three of that pony back
field have the goods, too, and the
combination can do everything and
do it well.
Line-up Named
Paulman can pass, punt, block,
and hit the line. Vigna can run,
block, and catch passes. Alustiza
can block, drive, quick kick, and
pass. And there is everything.
This is the way Tiny Thornihll
plans to start them. If needed,
Grayson, Topping, Hamilton, and
possibly Adams may see action later
in the game.
The Indians' Line-up
Ends. Monk Moscrip and Chet Ol
cott; tackles, Bob Reynolds and
Dale Beedle; guards, Bob Black and
Larry Rouble; center, either Alf
Brandin or Wes Muller; halfbacks,
Jimmy Coffis and Joe Vigna; full
back, Frank Alustiza; quarterback,
Bill Paulman.

Paulman can pass, punt, block,
and hit the line. Vigna can run,
block, and catch passes. Alustiza
can block, drive, quick kick, and
pass. And there is everything.
This is the way Tiny Thornihll
plans to start them. If needed,
Grayson, Topping, Hamilton, and
possibly Adams may see action later
in the game.
The Indians' Line-up
Ends. Monk Moscrip and Chet Ol
cott; tackles, Bob Reynolds and
Dale Beedle; guards, Bob Black and
Larry Rouble; center, either Alf
Brandin or Wes Muller; halfbacks,
Jimmy Coffis and Joe Vigna; full
back, Frank Alustiza; quarterback,
Bill Paulman.
Today they're asking questions about Stanford's pony backficld.
Tomorrow their queries will all be answered.
Tor tomorrow afternoon against the University of San Francisco
Dons, Head Coach Claude E. "Tiny" Thornhill sends a new backficld
combination of Stanford Indians on the Kezar Stadium grid. A combina
tion of small, fast, tricky men, all but one untested in tough competition.

It's all a part of Tiny's plan to
keep two injured backfield men on
the bench and start the next best
combination. So it will be veteran
Frank Alustiza at full, Bill Paulman
at quarter, Jimmy Coffis at left half,
and Joe Vigna calling signals from
his post at right half.
And this will let regular fullback
All-American Bobby Grayson and
Bones Hamilton sit on the sidelines
when the opening whistle blows and
perhaps all the time, if the new
quartet can handle the situation.
Black, Olcott To Play
Two other injured first stringers,
tackle Woody Adams and Keith
Topping, will be watching from the
side, too, and in their open spots
will be Bob Black and sophomore
Chet Olcott.
The rest of the line will start in
tact. But as was the case last year,
Thornhill is still undecided between
Alt' Brandin and Wes Muller at cen
ter. Tomorrow he'll probably start
Wes.
Thus Stanford goes into its second
game of the season tomorrow minus
four first stringers but with the va
cated spots filled with capable,
promising men.
Backfield Powerful
It'll take that kind of players to
handle U.S.F., too. Though Stan
ford receives the vote to come out
on top, U.S.R has a powerful, fast
backfield and a none-too-weak line
to make things just a trifle difficult
for a gang of Indians.
They're supposed to have a Bac
ciarini who can pass, and Seeno and
Pucci and Peterson who can drive,
and a Prentiss Wells who can run
like lightning.
On the line they're weaker, but
the last time they were seen in
action was last Saturday, and a lot
could be done with a ragged line in
seven days' time. They've got a
Blewitt, their captain, and a Letlow,
reputedly mighty tough gents, to
build that line around.
Coffis May Be Star
There's a little fellow starting for
Stanford who's going to keep that
line and those backs busy, though.
That's Jimmy Coffis.
Last week he looked like a million
in scrimmage, ran through the
whole second team, intercepted
passes, stole the show. He stands
only five feet six inches, weighs 172,
but has the mettle of another War
burton.
The other three of that pony back
field have the goods, too, and the
combination can do everything and
do it well.
