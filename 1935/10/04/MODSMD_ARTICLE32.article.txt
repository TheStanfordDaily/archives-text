# Bangs Gives Causes For European War
## Division of Spoils After Last Major Conflict Is One Reason 
### Crompton Hangs, Jr 
BOSTON, Mass., Oct. 3.—Whik
Mussolini's blackshirt legions and
Haile Selassie's black legions wage
undeclared war, and nearly all of
England's fleet stands in instant
readiness somewhere in the Medi
terranean, the rest of the world
stands by to see what action will be
taken by the League of Nations. A
reported Italian offensive, and the
burning of Aduwa, with 1700 casu
alties, brings up the question of
why should there be another war.
To find out why there will be an
other world war we have to go back
to the end of the last one. At the
Versailles Peace Conference the
winners took everything they could
from the losers, then, to cinch the
matter tied Germany, etc., down
with the peace treaty. Having done
this England, France & Co. left Italy
out in the cold by handing her a
choice piece of desert when a lot
more had been promised to get her
to join the allies in 1915.
Few Self-sufficient
Having won, it was only natural
for the victors to want to keep what
they had gained. The League of
Nations looked like the best way to
preserve their war gains and it was.
But we have to remember that Eng
land and France were about the
only self-sufficient nations in it;
Italy, Germany and Japan weren't.
They had to depend on others for
their life.
This state of things worked all
right for a while. For a few years
after the war, the going was pretty
tough, but from 1923 to 1928 busi
ness got better, and it seemed as
though the post-war arrangement
might work as long as world trade
held up. The depression began late
in '28 in most places in Europe, and
then the trouble started.
Peace Is Profitless
Made worse by the senseless sys
tem of war debts and reparations,
the depression raised a bumper
crop ot dictatorships. Most of these
grew up because democracy failed
to solve the economic problem of
th_- defeated ancl dependent nations,
iviussouni lumished the shining ex
ample: he had brought power and
apparent prosperity to Italy. Now
that the peace arrangements and
the depression brought real hard
ship, peace became profitless and
war, sooner or later, the only way
to get more territory and prosperity.
So we now have at least six na
tions, all preparing for war as the
only way out. In Japan, Germany,
Italy, Poland, Yugoslavia and Ru
mania everybody from the cradle
up is being prepared mentally, phys
ically and economically for the time
when they will surely have to go to
war.
Others in Array
Against these nations are arrayed
England, France and Russia. They
have all they really need and a
little more than they can take care
of. To them peace is the only way
to continued prosperity, and war
is a real danger. As a group they
have become definitely opposed to
efforts of other powers to expand.
To them the League is the only way
to preserve the status quo; the
Locarno pact freezing the bound
aries oi Western Europe was a mile
stone on the way to the millennium
—as they saw it.
Slowly but surely the signs point
ing to another war have accumu
lated. Japan invaded and seized
Manchuria and a part of China
proper, and did not call it war. Her
problem is solved, but only tem
porarily. Hitler would have marched

on Austria but for Mussolini's le
gions on the border. Ethiopia will
be taken over by Italy, though it
may not be called a war.
Next time—CAN WE KEEP OUT
OF WAR?

Next time—CAN WE KEEP OUT
OF WAR?
BOSTON, Mass., Oct. 3.—Whik
Mussolini's blackshirt legions and
Haile Selassie's black legions wage
undeclared war, and nearly all of
England's fleet stands in instant
readiness somewhere in the Medi
terranean, the rest of the world
stands by to see what action will be
taken by the League of Nations. A
reported Italian offensive, and the
burning of Aduwa, with 1700 casu
alties, brings up the question of
why should there be another war.
To find out why there will be an
other world war we have to go back
to the end of the last one. At the
Versailles Peace Conference the
winners took everything they could
from the losers, then, to cinch the
matter tied Germany, etc., down
with the peace treaty. Having done
this England, France & Co. left Italy
out in the cold by handing her a
choice piece of desert when a lot
more had been promised to get her
to join the allies in 1915.
Few Self-sufficient
Having won, it was only natural
for the victors to want to keep what
they had gained. The League of
Nations looked like the best way to
preserve their war gains and it was.
But we have to remember that Eng
land and France were about the
only self-sufficient nations in it;
Italy, Germany and Japan weren't.
They had to depend on others for
their life.
This state of things worked all
right for a while. For a few years
after the war, the going was pretty
tough, but from 1923 to 1928 busi
ness got better, and it seemed as
though the post-war arrangement
might work as long as world trade
held up. The depression began late
in '28 in most places in Europe, and
then the trouble started.
Peace Is Profitless
Made worse by the senseless sys
tem of war debts and reparations,
the depression raised a bumper
crop ot dictatorships. Most of these
grew up because democracy failed
to solve the economic problem of
th_- defeated ancl dependent nations,
iviussouni lumished the shining ex
ample: he had brought power and
apparent prosperity to Italy. Now
that the peace arrangements and
the depression brought real hard
ship, peace became profitless and
war, sooner or later, the only way
to get more territory and prosperity.
So we now have at least six na
tions, all preparing for war as the
only way out. In Japan, Germany,
Italy, Poland, Yugoslavia and Ru
mania everybody from the cradle
up is being prepared mentally, phys
ically and economically for the time
when they will surely have to go to
