# Tennessee Sensation Pitches Tigers To 8-3 Victory Over Chicago Cubs
## 
### 
NAVIN FIELD, Detroit, Oct. 3 (A 3 ).
—Thomas David Bridges, the Ten
nessee thunderbolt with a crackling
Curve, came to the rescue of the De
troit Tigers today and hurled them
right back into the middle of the
coldest battle waged for baseball's
world championship in 10 years.
The six-hit pitching of the slim
speed-ball artist, combined with a
blast of semifreezing weather and a
first-inning barrage of base-hits,
halted the impetuous charge of the
Chicago Cubs. The final score was
8 to 3 as the home team's "G-men"
opened fire for the first time with
their bats and drove the veteran
Charley Root to cover with a four
run fusillade climaxed by Hank
Greenberg's first home of the series.
The Cubs, somewhat chastened by
their beating today, still ruled slight
favorites as they hustled back to
their home grounds. They have been

unbeatable at home for a month
and they are confident of gaining
the advantage again with Lee in the
box tomorrow and the great Lon
Warneke, shut-out hero of yester
day's game, slated to come back for
the fourth game on Saturday.
The Cubs acted like most of the
onlookers felt this afternoon—half
frozen. They were helpless for fully
two-thirds of the game against the
dynamic speed and curves of
Bridges. The slim Tennessee sharp
shooter held the Chicagoans hitless
for three innings, yielded only three
well spaced hits in the first six
frames and eased up after his mates
piled up an overwhelming margin
by battering three Cub hurlers.
The Tiger triumph squared mat
ters at one game apiece, with the
warfare shifting from this frigid
battle ground to Chicago tomorrow
for the next three games. The en
thusiasm of the American League

champions, along with 46,742 half
frozen cash customers was cut some
what short by an injury to the slug
ging Greenberg, who hurt his left
wrist sliding into the plate in the
seventh inning.
Examination of Greenberg's arm
by the Tiger physician, soon after
the game, disclosed injured tendons,
but no serious damage otherwise
and it was expected the big first
sacker would be in the third game
tomorrow, whether he is handicap
ped or not.
The rival clubs left on special
trains, within an hour after the
game, in order to get plenty of rest
before resuming the series tomor
row on the home grounds of the
National League champions at
Wrigley field. The pitching selec
tions for the third game are Elden
Auker, submarine-ball right-hander
of the Tigers, and big Bill Lee,
freshman right-hander of the Cubs.
