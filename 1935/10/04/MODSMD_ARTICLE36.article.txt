# G.O.P. Talker Fires Answer To Roosevelt
## Republican Reply Given To Western Speeches 
### 
CHICAGO, Oct. 3 (A*).—'The na
tion's voters were told by Repre
sentative Theodore Christianson of
Minnesota today that the leadership
of the Republican Party would offer
the electorate a "positive and affir
mative program" as a substitute for
Roosevelt policies.
Chosen by Henry P. Fletcher, Re
publican National Chairman, to an
swer President Roosevelt's western
tour speeches, Christianson assailed
the New Deal and asserted that
while his party "will not rest its
case on Democratic derelictions," it
would "enlarge its traditional pro- |
gram" for the 1936 Presidential
election.
"Confronted by new problems, it
will, without departing from its
basic principles, enlarge its tradi
tional program and review its an
cient tenets in the light of changed
conditions," lie said in a radio ad
dress.
He pictured Republicanism as the
"rallying point" for "ali who, while
realizing the need of reform and the 1
desirability of improving the social
order, want to plant the future with
out scrapping the past."
The President's address at Los
Angeles made it "clear," that "the
future course of the New Deal is to
abandon altogether the principles ■
that have made the Democratic Par
ty a great and virile force in the ;
history of the nation," the Minne
sotan declared.
President Roosevelt's claims of
success for the Agricultural Adjust- i
ment Administration were false, I
Christianson said.
