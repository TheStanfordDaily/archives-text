# Jed Davies, Pioneer On Farm, Is Dead
## 
### DICK HODGSON 
Jed Davies, one of the last of old
characters peculiar to the Univer
sity, was found dead yesterday
morning in his cabin behind Mari
posa Hall by Officer Gordon Davis
and A. H. Wheeler, superintendent
of the Stanford postoffice.
Davies has long been a figure fa
miliar to every inhabitant of Row
and Hall, working as he has for the
past 14 years as a gardener for Dean
Mary Yost, as well as doing work
for different houses on the Row.
Maintaining throughout his life
time his Welsh accent and spirit
of independence, Davies always
was recognized by his employers
as the complete king of his garden
and his work. No man took more
personal interest in his task than
did Davies.
Coming from Wales as a young
man, he eventually found his way
to the Stanford Farm, where he
worked for Senator Stanford in the
stables, caring for the highly prized
horses of the Farm. As plans for
'the University grounds were com
pleted, Davies started work on the
Searsville Dam, a structure which is
still standing.
As active construction work on
the University ceased, Davies began
to work as a gardener around the
campus, and finally was employed
only by Dean Yost as the old man
approached his nineties.
Aside from guarding his work
with a belligerent interest, Davies'
one passion was speculation in
wild-cat stocks. Taking advantage

of every opportunity, he invested
his small savings in bogus mining
schemes, only to lose, but always
I hoping to find the lucky one.
So with the passing of Jed Davies,
I another campus figure is gone along
with Harry, Senator Stanford's val
! et, and others; leaving remem
j brances of early Stanford days.
