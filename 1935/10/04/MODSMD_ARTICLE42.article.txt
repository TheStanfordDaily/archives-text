# Chop Down Old Pine Tree: Local Locusts Laid Low
## 
### 
Raucous cries of "Woodman, spare
that tree!" this week warmed not the
cold cruel hearts of corporation yard
workmen. The old pine tree, which
has for years and years risen up
towards heaven as if in silent prayer
for a generation of Roble-bound
women, is goneâ€”only a soul-rend
ing stump is left.
Across from the P.O. on the Union
grounds a host of beetles, like the
menacing locusts of ancient Egypt,
were doing the old thing wrong;
so to prevent nature's little enemies
from eating up other trees, workmen
had to cut it down.
