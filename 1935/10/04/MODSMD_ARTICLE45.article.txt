# Dink Digs Up Fancy Front For Chappie
## 
### Jim Coop 
Chappie will come out next Thurs
day, October 10. Dink Dawson has
been working night and day for the
last three years on the cover, which
promises to be C'LOSSL.
It will be the "Freshman Num
ber." Any freshman on the Quad
that day without a Chappie will be
like a mugwamper without an apron,
which is something. I repeat. It's
something.
There will be lots of pictures and a
host of funny writings, including
IRVIN JORGENSEN's subtle hints
to the freshman on what to bring to
Encina. WHICH IS VERY FUNNY
because it's clean. Any freshman
without proper knowledge of this
will be like a mugwamper without
an apron, which is something.
Dorman H. Smith, America's "A
No. 1" cartoonist, will contribute
another of his excellent drawings.
I repeat. It's something. A new
contributor, Sally Gump of Gwut
irerrdt will do a fan dance on page
seventeen eight. Price will be only
15 cents. Per copy. BUY! BUY!
BUY!
If you can make something cut of
this, you're a genius. BUY!
