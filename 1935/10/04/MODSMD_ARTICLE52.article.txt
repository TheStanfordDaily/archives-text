# Drofnats, The Seer, Predicts Farm Victory

Sylvestre Juggernaut Drof
nats, may his tribe increase,
awoke one night from a sweet
dream of peace, took an aspirin,
and went to sleep again.
The result is, that Stanford
is going to beat U.S.F. 14 to 0.
"Beat 'em some more," said
Sylvestre. Sylvestre, who is a
Juggernaut of long-standing, is
quite elated over the way the
little Brown Bomber beat the
little Brown Baer.
He points with pride that due
to the discovery that Baer was
counted out after the fourth
round was really over, his pre
diction made before the fight
was one of the exclusive pre
dictions: "I'll take Baer in the
fourth round, and Louis will
take him in the fifth." Re
member?
