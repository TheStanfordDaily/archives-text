TOO MANY SOPIIS
FOR SENIORITIS
Senioritis is a malady commonly
associated with Stanford's 1935 foot
ball team. But it doesn't stand to
reason that the dread disease has
any hold on the Indians so far this
season.
Why? Because about half of the
men Tiny Thornhill is using on his
first string, during these days of
early season injuries, are sopho
mores.
Five of Stanford's starting squad
for tomorrow have two years of
varsity ball ahead of them. Cer
tainly that doesn't make for senior
tis.
In the backfield Tiny is planning
to start sophomores Jimmy Coffis at
left half and Bill Paulman at quar
ter. Both of these men will be play
ing their second game for the Stan
ford varsity. They were first-string
frosh last year.
Right Half Joe Vigna is another
sophomore as far as football is con
cerned, though he's a junior ir.
school. Last season Joe played
Greys; he didn't have the weight to
see varsity work then, but now he's
115 pounds heavier. Of course, his
time spent with the reserves is not
counted as varsity competition.
Those are three of the sophomores
on Stanford's much-publicized
"senior team."
Dale Beedle is another. He's mak
ing his debut at varsity ball this
season after last year's.: absence from
Stanford. The season previous he
was a sensation on the Papoose
team.
Chet Olcott, who plays behind the
injured Keith Topping, is the fifth
first-year man slated to start against
U.S.F. tomorrow.
In several cases Tiny has a veteran
to put in the game just in case his
sophs might not be able "to stand the
gaff. But if they do, and can come
through with a good showing, it'll be
a joyous day for those who have al
ready begun to worry about the In
dian's chances for next year.
Judging from the way that light,
comparatively inexperienced back
field (Frankie Alustiza is the only
senior in the lot) went against the
second string in Thursday's scrim
mage, those Dons will have a lot of
trouble with them tomorrow.
TOPPING TO MAKE
THE DECISION
Whether Keith Topping plays to
morrow has been left more or less
up to the veteran end to decide him
self. It seems that Keith's cracked
rib is in such condition that he
might be able to play tomorrow and
every game thereafter and not be
bothered at all.
And on the other hand he might
re-injure it on his first play against
the Dons. However, the doctors
don't think it will get any stronger
than it is now and Keith says he's
almost decided to go ahead and try
it out.
A WATCH
FOR SOMEONE
One of Stanford's gridders stands
a mighty good chance of annexing a
$50 watch for his work against the
Dons. He'll have an even better
chance if Farm football fans get be
hind him.
Here is the proposition. As a pub
licity gag the Albert S. Samuels Co.,
San Francisco jewelers, are handing
out watches right and left for play
ers voted to be the most outstanding
in their respective games.
Tomorrow some U.S.F. or Stanford
fellow will earn one. Spectators are
asked to send their votes by mail to
the above company during the week
following the game.
Now maybe Stanford won't have
the outstanding man on the field and
then again maybe it will. In any
event if Farms fans behind the fel
lows, and send plenty of votes,
someone on the Indian squad ought
to be sporting a new watch.

comparatively inexperienced back
field (Frankie Alustiza is the only
senior in the lot) went against the
second string in Thursday's scrim
mage, those Dons will have a lot of
trouble with them tomorrow.
TOPPING TO MAKE
THE DECISION
Whether Keith Topping plays to
morrow has been left more or less
up to the veteran end to decide him
self. It seems that Keith's cracked
rib is in such condition that he
might be able to play tomorrow and
every game thereafter and not be
bothered at all.
And on the other hand he might
re-injure it on his first play against
the Dons. However, the doctors
don't think it will get any stronger
than it is now and Keith says he's
almost decided to go ahead and try
it out.
A WATCH
FOR SOMEONE
One of Stanford's gridders stands
a mighty good chance of annexing a
$50 watch for his work against the
Dons. He'll have an even better
chance if Farm football fans get be
hind him.
Here is the proposition. As a pub
licity gag the Albert S. Samuels Co.,
San Francisco jewelers, are handing
out watches right and left for play
ers voted to be the most outstanding
in their respective games.
Tomorrow some U.S.F. or Stanford
fellow will earn one. Spectators are
asked to send their votes by mail to
the above company during the week
following the game.
Now maybe Stanford won't have
the outstanding man on the field and
then again maybe it will. In any
event if Farms fans behind the fel
lows, and send plenty of votes,
someone on the Indian squad ought
to be sporting a new watch.

TOO MANY SOPIIS
FOR SENIORITIS
Senioritis is a malady commonly
associated with Stanford's 1935 foot
ball team. But it doesn't stand to
reason that the dread disease has
any hold on the Indians so far this
season.
Why? Because about half of the
men Tiny Thornhill is using on his
first string, during these days of
early season injuries, are sopho
mores.
Five of Stanford's starting squad
for tomorrow have two years of
varsity ball ahead of them. Cer
tainly that doesn't make for senior
tis.
In the backfield Tiny is planning
to start sophomores Jimmy Coffis at
left half and Bill Paulman at quar
ter. Both of these men will be play
ing their second game for the Stan
ford varsity. They were first-string
frosh last year.
Right Half Joe Vigna is another
sophomore as far as football is con
cerned, though he's a junior ir.
school. Last season Joe played
Greys; he didn't have the weight to
see varsity work then, but now he's
115 pounds heavier. Of course, his
time spent with the reserves is not
counted as varsity competition.
Those are three of the sophomores
on Stanford's much-publicized
"senior team."
Dale Beedle is another. He's mak
ing his debut at varsity ball this
season after last year's.: absence from
Stanford. The season previous he
was a sensation on the Papoose
team.
Chet Olcott, who plays behind the
injured Keith Topping, is the fifth
first-year man slated to start against
U.S.F. tomorrow.
In several cases Tiny has a veteran
to put in the game just in case his
sophs might not be able "to stand the
gaff. But if they do, and can come
through with a good showing, it'll be
a joyous day for those who have al
ready begun to worry about the In
dian's chances for next year.
