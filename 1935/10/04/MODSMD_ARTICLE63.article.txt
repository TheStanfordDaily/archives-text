NEW YORK. Oct. 3 (/P). â€”Ameri-
can residents of Ethiopia are safely
distant, for the present at least,
from the scene of the Italian Ethio
pian warfare.
Most of the 100 Americans listed,
doctors, missionaries, and members
of the American legation, are in
Addis Ababa, about 500 miles south.
The others are scattered in smaller
communities in nearby areas.
