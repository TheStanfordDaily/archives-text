# Frosh Open Season Tomorrow
## Bradshaw's Team Meets Sacramento Game with Jaysee Outfit Is Expected To Be Defensive Battle 
### Bob Leland 
Tomorrow at 10 o'clock in the
stadium, Coach Jimmy Bradshaw's
Papoose gridders get their first ac
tual test of the season against Sacra
mento Junior College.
i 1 i'om the looks ol things, the game
v/ill resolve itself into a defensive
battle, both teams having big men
in the line. Ihe frosh forwards will
average a neat 200 pounds, with
Fred Gustalson the lightest man at
187. Pete Zagar is tops at 210.
Bradshaw, while not committing
himself, named the fallowing as
till- probable starting line-up: Dick
Sutton, center: Frank McMillan
and Gustalson, guards; Dave
Carnahan and Zagar, tackles; Irv |
Cumniings and Walt Kege, ends; |
Ed Garnier, quarterback; Hank
Huebel and Bill Kirsch, half
backs; and Wally deWitt, fullback.
Of these men, all but Cumniings
have been actively engaged in the
numerous scrimmages this week.
The big end has been nursing a [
bad ankle, but is now fully recov
ered and ready to go.
Sacramento has already played one ;
game against Chico State of the Far j
Western Conference. The contest
ended in a scoreless tie, with little :
in the way of offense being shown j
by either team.
Show Possibilities '
Particularly active in gumming '
up plays in last night's scrimmage, i
the third of the week, was Sam I
Beckley, 6 feet 4 inches and 210 j
pounds of left tackle, who showed [
fine defensive work.
For the first time this week, the
yearlings looked like the goods.
They were charging on offensive
and displayed some excellent I
downfield blocking. Louis Veen
ker was especially proficient in
this respect. Another second
stringer who looked good was
Ken Jordan at fullback, who
tossed some neat passes and hit ,
the line well. Pete Fay at left |
half also looked good.
Outside of the first-string line, !
Bradshaw has several good men to
choose from. For example, there are
Andy Slojkovich, Don Butler, Hal
Saunders and Ted Noll, ends. Beck
ley, Walt Hartzell, John West and
Byron West back up the tackles.
Tony Mecia, Mat Guiberson, Bob
Shreve, George Davis and George
Campbell are capable reserves in the
center of the line.
May Move Up
Bill Hawkins, Jim Grubbs, Fay,
Kcenker, Jordan, and Vern Maino I
are pushing the regulars for berths
in the backfield and before the sea- j
.son is over some of these men may
be among the starters.
It would appeal that sheer weight
of numbers will spell the downfall
of Sacramento, for as has been men- j
tioned, the reserves are mostly as big
as the regulars.
In the game tomorrow tab for
watching: Zagar, slashing tackle;
Ed Garnier, hard working quarter- s
back; and Harry Huebel, shifty left
halfback and passer de luxe. These
boys should be worth watching.
Someone else will probably steal
the show.
