## 
### 
Louis Cass was the medalist in
the qualifying matches staged this
past week for positions on the var
sity and frosh teams, turning in 149
for a 36-hole round.
Fourteen upperclassmen and seven
freshmen were awarded positions on
their respective teams following the
qualifying. The last positions on each
team are being contested by men
who tied in their medal scores. Bill
Colm and Jim Welch, both of whom
qualified with 159 for the varsity,
will play off for the fourteenth po
sition on the team. Ed Bosbychell
and Herb Scheonlen will fight it out
for the bottom berth on the fresh
man tee.

single point Spec Stewart and Morse
