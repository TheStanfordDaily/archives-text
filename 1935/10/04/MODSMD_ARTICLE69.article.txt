# Novice Tennis Matches Begin
## 
### 
The first matches for the posses
sion of the Hahn trophy, offered to
the winner of the open novice tennis
tournament, should be played off to
day. Since matches for positions on
ihe freshman tennis squad will not
start until the winter ciuarter, this is
the first opportunity which freshman
aspirants will have to show their
worth.
Each of the 50 contestants must
play a match each week as long as
he remains unbeaten, and the win
ner will retain possession of the cup
for a year. First-round matches
must be completed by next Tuesday.
