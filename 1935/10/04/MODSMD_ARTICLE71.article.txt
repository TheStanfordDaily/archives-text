# Angell Field Construction Nears Finish
## Track Will Rank on Par With Finest; Ready For Spring Use 
### 
Angell Field is having its face
lifted. The time-honored turf where
Stanford has waged its annual track j
battles for the past 28 years is being I
replaced by what B.A.C. officials
have every reason to expect will
rpnk on a par with the finest track !
a;id fieid units in the country.
And they'll not be disappointed, >
either, if Professor Charles Moser
of the Civil Engineering depart- i
ment, Sam McDonnell, veteran con- j
struction supervisor, and 25 busy
workmen have anything to say ;
about it.
$25,000 Appropriated
Early last summer $25,000 from
the B.A.C. started the downfall of ■
the original oval which had come !
in for so much criticism during the '
1934-35 track season.
Yesterday the first section of the
new track, cut two feet deeper than
its predecessor, supplied with an '
adequate drainage system, cush- I
ioned with an inch and a half of
ground redwood bark, packed with
fine cinders, and finally sealed with
clay, was nearing completion. By
November 15, predicted McDon
nell, the entire oval will be complete
in every detail, but it will take the
rains of the winter and early spring !
to harden the track enough for
actual usage.
Engineers Enthusiastic
Both Professor Moser and Mc- i
Donnell labored over Angell Field
No. 1, and both are highly optimis- i
tic in discussing the improvements I
put into their newer edition. The i
pole vault unit is placed directly in !
front of the bleachers, while the !
high jump and broad jump pits are j
built closer to the center of the [
new field. The javelin take-off lies \
virtually in the same spot where ,
Professor Moser put it on the origi- i
nal oval. Grass has already sprouted
and will enclose the runways and
takeoffs.
Work on the field has been great
ly facilitated, according to McDon
nell, by the co-operative spirit and
interest of his workmen, who, dur- !
ing the summer, were chiefly stu- J
dents.

Both Professor Moser and Mc- i
Donnell labored over Angell Field
No. 1, and both are highly optimis- i
tic in discussing the improvements I
put into their newer edition. The i
pole vault unit is placed directly in !
front of the bleachers, while the !
high jump and broad jump pits are j
built closer to the center of the [
new field. The javelin take-off lies \
virtually in the same spot where ,
Professor Moser put it on the origi- i
nal oval. Grass has already sprouted
and will enclose the runways and
takeoffs.
Work on the field has been great
ly facilitated, according to McDon
nell, by the co-operative spirit and
interest of his workmen, who, dur- !
ing the summer, were chiefly stu- J
dents.
