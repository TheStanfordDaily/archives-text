With warfare between Italy and Ethiopia
breaking out on Wednesday at o'clock
instead of on the eleventh at 'â€¢> o'clock in this
much ballyhooed war, Farm students sit back,
serenely hoping lhat the war will remain of
but academic importance to them.
Certainly it is an unusual war. The amount
of pre-gaine talk is the most obvious proof of
this. Previous wars have oil threatened for
years before they broke, but history is not
replete with examples of wars that run on a
day-to-day schedule like a railroad train.
Probably the most hopeful of the new as
pects lo this war is that there seem to be defi
nite signs that the world is waking up. No
longer does the old hushwa have the old ap
peal. After ali, Mussolini is doing little worse
than England, France. .Japan, and even the
F.S. did in their time. He is a little more cold
blooded. yes. Hut lie has to be, for, as a late
comer, lie finds the old pleas of aiding the
half-civilized and the like simply don't go
over.
Most wars have a popular and an unpopu
lar side but the relative popularity of a
cause is usually subject to change or reversal
from country to country. Not so in this case.
World-wide belie' in Ethiopia's righteousness
and Mussolini's malfeasance is probably with
out precedent.
Poor Mussolini, in his "militant address to
mobilized Italy" Wednesday, could not say
" I hose beastly Ethiopians, for years they have
raided our outposts, broken their pledges," ad
nauseam. He had to come out flat-looted, and
declare:

| "There is attempted to commit against thein
(the Italian people) the blackest of injustices,
lhat of withholding from them a little soil
under the sun."
Equally unimpressive to everyone today are
the Italian communiques which say her moves
are defensive and aimed to comhat the "men
ace" of Ethiopian mobilizations.
Socio-political observers await with interest
the meeting of the League of Nations tomor
row to see whether or not it will apply eco
nomic, financial, and possibly even military
"sanctions" against Italy if il finds the latter
gulty of breaking the League covenant. It will
be the biggest test the League has ever faced.
! The rest of the world anxiously watches the
developing difficulties, hoping it will not be
[ drawn into a cataclysm such as that of two
J decades ago.
America, meanwhile, unconcernedly cuts
Mussolini off the air to make way for the
\\ orld's Series, taking comfort from the words
of the President uttered in San Diego. Roose
velt's remarks present an unfortunate parallel
i to the early World War remarks of Wood row-
Wilson, but should be intensely reassuring,
; especially for students who are at a likely
age for military service. He said in part:
"Despite what happens . . . the United Stales
| shall and in list remain . . . unentangled and
i free.
"... I say to you most earnestly once more
j that the people of America and the Govern
ment of those people intend and expect to
I remain at peace with all the world."
