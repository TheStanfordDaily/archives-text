# More Cars, More Students—Open Season on Parking Violators
## 
### 
Despite Women's Council's warning to Slim
lord's "1100" that campus police have de
clared open season on parking violators, both
Men's and Women's Councils are preparing
lor busy meetings next week to mete out lines
in payment for a large number of tickets.
There are more than I 100 cars on the cam
pus Ibis fall. In order to cope with the trallic
congestion that this increase entails, the law
enforcement department has stressed the ne
cessity of keeping narrow roads clear. Cam
pus police have announced that they will be
particularly strict in distributing tickets for
illegal parking across the street from and
<»n the north side ol the post otTice, on the
pathway from the physics corner to the chem
istry building, and on the path from the en
gineering corner to the men's dormitories.
Insistence on caution in driving and strict
observance of "no parking" signs seems to be
the only way the University can deal with the
added congestion of this year's influx of cars.
Daily Challenges the Faculty
I'or years Stanford's austere faculty has
been holding up the Daily as a horrible blotch
on the journalistic profession's records. For
years said austere group has complained of
mis-spelled names and mis-quoted facts.
A recently issued comment to the e fleet that
said faculty could publish a much better cam
pus newspaper than can ail undergraduate
stall proved to be the last straw.
The Daily now throws down the gauntlet,
and challenges tin* professorial body to com
pletely write and edit one entire issue of this
paper.
Stanford's faculty has rarely had such an
opporl unity.
