For the benefit of a certain erudite English profes
sor who objects to Our Hasher's strained analogies,
may I say at this time that "Love is like a roller coaster
—without either the rollers or the coasters"?
Latest style in campus jinrickshas was assembled
in certain impromptu ceremonies held in one of the
hall/at a late hour one night this week. It .seems that
certain annual rites of the little savages were being
held, but an unruly customer with a crying need for
getting his ears beaten down made himself obnoxious.
About GO erstwhile Stanford gentlemen took the law
in their own hands. They grabbed the offending mem
ber, tied him down tightly to a bed, stripped him of
all vestments save a pair of pajama pants, doused him
with water, and kept the humidity high (ceiling, low)
by covering him with a wet towel. Then the mob scene
entrained for Roble. The climax of the festivities was
reached at 1:15 a.m., when the assembled gentlemen
raised their voices hailing thee, our alma mater, and
the terrific Stanford women inside. All lights inside
the building wore doused, possibly to save eye-strain.
But luckily for all concerned, the jockey escaped from
his hobby-horse before the police, summoned by the
terrified inmates, arrived.
Ileal college life is being experienced by Theta
Chi, latest exponents of the wide-open design for liv
ing. Reports that Stanford is the most air-minded
college in the world are confirmed by the experiences
of these hardy cave-men. Because the boys have no
kitchen, no cook, no nothin. they have contracted
with the Stanford Union to provide sustenance while
the boys continue their life in God's great out-of-doors.
Says the house president, "If the contractor ever gets
through hacking away the walls and gets the new edi
fice completed, we expect to have a new house. Wc
are hoping to get the boys out of the trenches by
Christmas."
1 he C hi Omegas almost decided to begin rebuilding
after school opened, but took one look at the haggard
faces of the Delta and Theta Chis and decided to
frame Ihrir architect's plans for ttkshing instead.
