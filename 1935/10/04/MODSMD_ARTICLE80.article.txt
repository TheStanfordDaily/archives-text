# HUEY LONG BUILDS A UNIVERSITY
## 
### 
General William Tecumseh Sherman, before his
march to the sea, founded Louisiana State University.
It was just another of those mistakes that even great
generals make. The unknown, unheard-of, and insig
nificant hilly-billy school produced a great football
team in 1908 and very little of anything else until a
few years ago ;
Then Huey Pierce Long became governor of the
Pelican State. Governor Long decided that some
changes should be made. Louisiana needed prestige.
A great university would bring that prestige and its
cost would create a debt which would necessarily
draw money into the state. Furthermore, His Excel
lency wished to leave a monument which would for
ever be connected with his name.
No doubt other considerations entered into Huey
Long's determination to build a great educational in
stitution in Baton Rouge. It has been suggested that
wishing to perpetuate his regime, he, like Mussolini,
Stalin, and Hitler, wished to train the youth of the state
so later he would be supported by their grateful and
loyal votes. Then, too, Long had a deep-rooted grudge
against Tulanc University, Louisiana State's arch rival.
The former college had refused to grant him an hon
orary degree at his suggestion. But perhaps above all
these more or less practical and personal reasons, Long
was genuinely interested in young people and edu
cation.

Early in 1926 the newly elected governor took stock
of the situation and started issuing orders. A tremen
dous tract of land on the outskirts of Baton Rouge,
three miles from the old Louisiana State campus, was
purchased. It was flat, fertile land and, according to
wiseacres, oil land that Long wished to protect. With
the rapidity with which Long did all things, a new
university sprouted up. Renaissance-style architecture
was decided upon. Low, porticoed buildings with many
gardens and terraces about them were constructed.
And every one of those yellow stuccoed buildings bore
the governor's name in a most prominent position,
By 1931 the new campus was, for practical pur
poses, complete. New buildings, however, are still
going up, but all the important steps were taken under
the Long administration. From a purely aesthetic
standpoint, the governor's creation was a success. Lou
isiana State was generally recognized as the most novel
and attractive campus of the South.
♦ * * ail
Thus by 1931 Long had created a university.
Courses offered by Louisiana State covered a wide
range: law, forestry, sugar chemistry, journalism, mu
sic, dramatic arts, engineering, arts and sciences, edu
cation, and agriculture. Even aeronautical engineering
and commercial aviation courses were added. The en
rollment leaped every year. This fall 5000 students
were expected.
West Points successful football coach, Captain
Lawrence McCracken Jones, was hired. He took the
lowliest of the Southeastern Conference teams and in
his first year at L.S.U. won every conference game.
The second year of his regime saw the Louisiana Stale
Tigers undefeated.
Coach Bernie Moore's track and field team sur
prised sports writers all over the country by capturing
the National Collegiate track championship in 1933.
Huey Long's plans for his university were meeting
success everywhere. —Robert E. Bcrnhard, Jr.

West Points successful football coach, Captain
Lawrence McCracken Jones, was hired. He took the
lowliest of the Southeastern Conference teams and in
his first year at L.S.U. won every conference game.
The second year of his regime saw the Louisiana Stale
Tigers undefeated.
Coach Bernie Moore's track and field team sur

Huey Long's plans for his university were meeting
success everywhere. —Robert E. Bcrnhard, Jr.
(Monday: Huey Long "Interferes" with the Uni
versity.)
General William Tecumseh Sherman, before his
march to the sea, founded Louisiana State University.
It was just another of those mistakes that even great
generals make. The unknown, unheard-of, and insig
nificant hilly-billy school produced a great football
team in 1908 and very little of anything else until a
few years ago ;
Then Huey Pierce Long became governor of the
Pelican State. Governor Long decided that some
changes should be made. Louisiana needed prestige.
A great university would bring that prestige and its
cost would create a debt which would necessarily
draw money into the state. Furthermore, His Excel
lency wished to leave a monument which would for
ever be connected with his name.
No doubt other considerations entered into Huey
Long's determination to build a great educational in
stitution in Baton Rouge. It has been suggested that
wishing to perpetuate his regime, he, like Mussolini,
Stalin, and Hitler, wished to train the youth of the state
so later he would be supported by their grateful and
loyal votes. Then, too, Long had a deep-rooted grudge
against Tulanc University, Louisiana State's arch rival.
The former college had refused to grant him an hon
orary degree at his suggestion. But perhaps above all
these more or less practical and personal reasons, Long
was genuinely interested in young people and edu
cation.

Early in 1926 the newly elected governor took stock
of the situation and started issuing orders. A tremen
dous tract of land on the outskirts of Baton Rouge,
three miles from the old Louisiana State campus, was
purchased. It was flat, fertile land and, according to
wiseacres, oil land that Long wished to protect. With
the rapidity with which Long did all things, a new
university sprouted up. Renaissance-style architecture
was decided upon. Low, porticoed buildings with many
gardens and terraces about them were constructed.
And every one of those yellow stuccoed buildings bore
the governor's name in a most prominent position,
By 1931 the new campus was, for practical pur
poses, complete. New buildings, however, are still
going up, but all the important steps were taken under
the Long administration. From a purely aesthetic
standpoint, the governor's creation was a success. Lou
isiana State was generally recognized as the most novel
and attractive campus of the South.

Thus by 1931 Long had created a university.
Courses offered by Louisiana State covered a wide
range: law, forestry, sugar chemistry, journalism, mu
sic, dramatic arts, engineering, arts and sciences, edu
cation, and agriculture. Even aeronautical engineering
and commercial aviation courses were added. The en
rollment leaped every year. This fall 5000 students
were expected.
