# MOVIES AND THE THEATER
## 
### 
| The Editor, Sir:
There seems to have been consid- ;
| erable comment of late in regard to j
: the source of funds for the new !
! theatre.
Since finances used for this pur- !
pose are diverted from uses of more j
| benefit to the present student body '
; and particularly the seniors, might
j we suggest that provision be made I
for modern motion-picture projec- !
j tion.
| Then arrangements could be made '
I to provide for the presentation of;
■ some of ihe better pictures with
| the particular consideration that ;
: profits from this or any other stu- !
dent production be used only by '
! the presenting organization or by i
! the Associated Students thereby j
J making way for a return to the
1 students of finances that they are
now involuntarily donating.

The motion picture equipment '
is taken care of in the plans.—Ed.
