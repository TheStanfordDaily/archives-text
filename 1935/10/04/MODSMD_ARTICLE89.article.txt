HONOLULU, Oct. 3 (/P).—Speak
ing in America's main defense out
post while the sound of guns rolled
round the globe, Secretary of War
George H. Dern today told guests at
a community luncheon that recent
events had proved treaties are •
worthless unless a nation has means
to enforce them.
"Any competent student of gov- j
ernment and history must agree
that the very backbone of any gov- i
ernment is force," said the Secre
tary.
