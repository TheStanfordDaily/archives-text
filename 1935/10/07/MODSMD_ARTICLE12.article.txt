# 'Ring' Lectures Start Tuesday
## 
### 
The first of a series of Tuesday
evening lectures on Richard Wag
ner and his "Ring" will be presented
at 7:30 o'clock tomorrow night in the
Assembly Hall by Professor B. Q.
Morgan, who will speak on "Rich
ard Wagner, the Poet of the Nib
lung's Ring."
Professor Morgan will state
briefly the facts of Wagner's life,
and outline his work as an opera
composer. Then, turning to the
story of the Niblungs, he will point
out the distinction between the
Norse and continental versions of it.
He plans to give a detailed discus
sion of the content of Wagner's op
eras, pointing out the differences be
tween Wagner's conception of the
opera and that of other composers,
with the view of interpreting his
intentions.
In conclusion, an attempt will be
made to present a comprehensive
view of the entire Niblung cycle and
its meaning.
