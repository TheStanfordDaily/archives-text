# Quad Awarded National Honor
## All-American Rating Won By High-Point Score 
### 
All-American rating was awarded
the 1935 Quad in the annual year
book contest of the National Schol
astic Press Association, according to
word received Saturday by Chuck '
Fontius, business manager.
Highest possible rating, all -
American scoring is given to only
about 10 yearbooks in the United j
States by the association's judges.
To earn this high honor, the Quad
obtained 775 out of a perfect score
of 1000 points. More than 7(><)
points were required for all-Amer
ican rating. Edited by Everett
Moses, managed by Chuck Fon
tius, the 1935 Quad rated among
the very highest in points earned.
The judges gave perfect ratings to
the book's theme of "youth," its con
tent, and its originality. Under
finances" the book scored 100 per
cent. Fred L. Kildow, director of
the press association, stressed the
1 fact that many yearbooks lose in- j
j stead of make money, and are forced J
to get funds from student body cof
fers.
Both Fontius and Don Hanson,
this year's editor, believe "the
193fi Quad will be every bit as
good as the 1935 all-Amcriean ■
book." According to Fontius, the
stafT is able to make the Quad
editorially superior and at the
same time financially successful.
In 1931, the last time the Quad
; entered the contest, all-American
rating was earned.
