# Storey Denounces Mud Fight Tradition
## 
### 
In a statement made to the Daily
last night in which he denounced "a
contest for college men that centers
around a dirty mud-hole," Dr.
Thomas A. Storey, head of the men's
health service, went on record as
strongly opposing' the traditional
freshman-sophomore mudfight held
for 1935 last Thursday.
"While it didn't appear so much
this year, previous fights have
shown much poor sportsmanship
on the part of the sophomores,"
j said Dr. Storey. "The freshmen
respect the rules, nnd the sopho
mores fragrantly break them. Thus
! first-year men immediately get the
idea that rules at Stanford arc
made just to be broken."
After Thursdhy's battle, seven
1 participants needed emergency med
| ical attention. This health side of
'he question, according to the doc
tor, is an important one. "Many
' colds and sinus troubles develop
' after these fights every year. Even
bones are broken. Bruises and cuts
j which naturally result from the
I scuffle are exposed to dirt and grime

[ containing any number of germs.
; The chance for infection is unusually
i great.
Tug-o'-War Favored
"Newspapers and newsreels spread
j pictures of the mudfight all over the
j country. Shots of a grimy, dirty,
wallowing fight is certainly a poor
advertisement for Stanford."
Dr. Storey favors discontinuing
| the mudfight for some other form of
athletic contest. "A tug-o'-war, for
; example, would be much better from
! the standpoint of sportsmanship and
health."
Zonnc Okays Mudfight
On the other side of the fence was
Phil Zonne, freshman, who led his
teammates to a 7(MJB win over the
sophomores. "The brawl was a lot
of fun, and I'm looking forward to it
next year. I talked to some of the
boys that were hurt, and they said .t
was worth it." Zonne did not favor
a tug-o'-war.
Guy Haggerty, president and cap
j tain of the defeated sophomores,
could not be reached last night for a
j statement.
