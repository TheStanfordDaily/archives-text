# Hat-Check Tipping Now Thing of Past
## 
### 
Starting with the A.S.S.U. dance
following the U.C.L.A. game Satur
day, there will be no tipping of coat
checkers at Stanford dances. This is j
a new rule made by Student Man
i
ager Bob Gros, with the sanction of ;
Graduate Manager A1 Masters and j
the Ex Committee.
The past custom of paying check- j
room workers for the custody of ,
dancers' hats and coats resulted in j
an average of $10 or $15 per dance
for these checkers, in addition to !
their regular salaries.
To Serve Free Punch
Another innovation at Saturday j
night's dance will be the serving of
free punch—again saving the Stan
ford rough (or smoothie) —from 10
to 20 cents or more. This plan will
be kept in operation if it proves a
success financially.
Gros' statement follows:
"It certainly seems only reasonable
that Stanford dance guests' bids
should entitle them to the courtesy
of free wrap-checking. In the last
analysis, student body functions
should not be profit-seeking ven
tures, anyway. This is precisely why
I am instituting this no-tipping pol
icy—to try to give the student body
a little more for their money. The
checkers will be paid reasonable
wages for their work, and will be
instructed not to accept tips here
after."
Brooke Approves
Wally Brooke, A.S.S.U. president,
also voiced approval of the policy.
"The policy is perfectly logical," he
stated, "for the present dance bud
gets can easily stand the slight extra
cost. The increased enrollment will
add to the number of students pres
j ent, causing the sale of mode bids.
When a student comes to a dance
he expects to have his coat and hat
checked. Many students cannot af
ford to put out additional money for
' tips."
