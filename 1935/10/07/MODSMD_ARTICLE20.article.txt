Stanford failed to live up to Drof
j nats' expectation, when that men-
I thol-cooled potato, Lewis, threw in a
hiring hall and two longshoremen
J supporting wives and kiddies.
All in all, Drofnats did pretty well

j75 per cent. "It would have been
I 100 per cent if those nasty old Cali
i fornia and Washington men hadn't
