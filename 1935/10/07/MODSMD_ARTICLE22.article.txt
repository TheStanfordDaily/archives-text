# Men's Council To Convene In First Session
## Forty To Appear Today As Traffic Violators 
### 
The Men's Council will hold its
first meeting, since the election of
Bob Gros as chairman of the council,
this afternoon at 1 o'clock.
This first meeting, according to
Chairman Gros, will be entirely a
"speeding council." After giving
students a week's respite, Gordy, the
campus cop, succeeded in finding
over 40 miscreants breaking parking
regulations about the Farm, and
many others who have received tags
for speeding offenses. The offenders
should, according to Gros, appear
when and where their individual
citations demand for reparation or
an additional fine will be imposed
upon them.
Honor code plans will be held over
until an election next Tuesday, at
which an additional member will be
elected to the council. After this
election the Men's Council will, in a
series of meetings at Encina, instruct
the freshman class in the meaning
and responsibilities of the Honor
Code at Stanford.
