# Sub Backfield Shows Power In Don Defeat
## Jimmy Coffis Displays Abilities in Broken Field Running 
### Gordy Frost 
At the same time that thick San
Francisco fog rolled in on Kezar
Saturday, and Stanford rolled up a
10-0 victory over the Dons, the fog
that's been surrounding Stanford's
1935 grid hopes so far this season,
lifted; Stanford learned a lot about
its team.
First Stanford learned that with
three first-stringers, including
one all-American, on the bench,
it could still put a good looking
ball club on the field. That was
worth knowing because the lack of
substitute strength for Bobby
Grayson and Bones Hamilton has
caused considerable worry.
And Stanford learned that thero
was a man who could start and
twist and dodge, run the broken
field like a demon, and intercept
passes. That was stocky little Jim
my Coffis, who's so short he looked
like a helmet on legs racing over the
Kezar turf Saturday.
Alustiza Still Tops
Stanford learned that Frankie
Alustiza hasn't lost his ability to
smash and cut through the line. This
time a line which distinguished it
! self for stubborn, dogged defense.
Stanford learned that there was a
new coffin corner kicker on the In
dian squad (it was already known
that Alustiza had ability in that
j field) who placed one out on the
j one-foot line. That was Bill Paul
man.
And Stanford learned that Joe
Vigna was still good for yardage on
reverses, despite a few losses, and
that Mr. Vigna did a good job
railing plays considering it was his
first try at that work.
Stanford learned that the linemen
were beginning to hit their last-sea
son's pace, in that they did a mighty
good job of stopping the U.S.F. of
fense dead still.
And Stanford also learned that
there is still room for improvement
in blocking. According to Tiny
Thornhill the Stanford football team
is going to be learning that all next
j week.
Reynolds Injured
Yes, Saturday's game cleared up a
; lot of points and, in contrast to the
| previous week's game, only one in
jury was incurred, and that not
j serious. Bob Reynolds spent the
week-end in the hospital with a
bruised hip but is out today and
J probably will return to practice to
j morrow.
Thornhill agreed last night that he
was fairly well pleased with Satur
day's showing. He found fault
I mainly with the blocking and the
fact that the Cards took too much
time in the hurdle.
Both those faults should be ironed
out during the week's practice and
with the injured veterans back in
play, Tiny expects to be in good
shape for U.C.L.A. next Saturday.

j serious. Bob Reynolds spent the
week-end in the hospital with a
bruised hip but is out today and
J probably will return to practice to
j morrow.
Thornhill agreed last night that he
was fairly well pleased with Satur
day's showing. He found fault
I mainly with the blocking and the
fact that the Cards took too much
time in the hurdle.
Both those faults should be ironed
out during the week's practice and
with the injured veterans back in
play, Tiny expects to be in good
shape for U.C.L.A. next Saturday.
At the same time that thick San
Francisco fog rolled in on Kezar
Saturday, and Stanford rolled up a
10-0 victory over the Dons, the fog
that's been surrounding Stanford's
1935 grid hopes so far this season,
lifted; Stanford learned a lot about
its team.
First Stanford learned that with
three first-stringers, including
one all-American, on the bench,
it could still put a good looking
ball club on the field. That was
worth knowing because the lack of
substitute strength for Bobby
Grayson and Bones Hamilton has
caused considerable worry.
And Stanford learned that thero
was a man who could start and
twist and dodge, run the broken
field like a demon, and intercept
passes. That was stocky little Jim
my Coffis, who's so short he looked
like a helmet on legs racing over the
Kezar turf Saturday.
Alustiza Still Tops
Stanford learned that Frankie
Alustiza hasn't lost his ability to
smash and cut through the line. This
time a line which distinguished it
! self for stubborn, dogged defense.
Stanford learned that there was a
new coffin corner kicker on the In
dian squad (it was already known
that Alustiza had ability in that
j field) who placed one out on the
j one-foot line. That was Bill Paul
man.
And Stanford learned that Joe
Vigna was still good for yardage on
reverses, despite a few losses, and
that Mr. Vigna did a good job
railing plays considering it was his
first try at that work.
Stanford learned that the linemen
were beginning to hit their last-sea
son's pace, in that they did a mighty
good job of stopping the U.S.F. of
fense dead still.
And Stanford also learned that
there is still room for improvement
in blocking. According to Tiny
Thornhill the Stanford football team
is going to be learning that all next
j week.
Reynolds Injured
Yes, Saturday's game cleared up a
; lot of points and, in contrast to the
| previous week's game, only one in
jury was incurred, and that not
j serious. Bob Reynolds spent the
week-end in the hospital with a
bruised hip but is out today and
J probably will return to practice to
j morrow.
