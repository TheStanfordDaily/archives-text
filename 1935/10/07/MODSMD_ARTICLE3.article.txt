with Tennis Club tryouts at the same
time. While only W.A.A. members,
sponsors, and new women are in
vited to the barbecue, everyone may
come to the preliminary events.
It is especially urged that all new

be no dinner either at the Oaks or at
Roble that night. The barbecue will
start at 5:30 and last till about 7
