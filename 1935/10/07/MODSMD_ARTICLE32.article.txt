"CHINA SEAS"
At the Fox Stanford
BJean Harlow is Jean Har
low, and that's enough of a
review. But just in case
you're interested, Clark Gable
and Lewis Stone also appear in this
picture, and they're the ones that do
the acting.
Gable is a China Seas skipper who
used to be a gentleman. He's be
leaguered by a female barnacle
(Harlow), who has attached herself
to him. When the girl from dear old
blighty appears, he tries to shake

in a pirate raid convinces him he'd
better stick to the barnacle.
The picture gets the usual superb
MGM production, and the only fault
is a little too much of Miss Harlow's
"Okay, toots." ' â€”Bernheim
