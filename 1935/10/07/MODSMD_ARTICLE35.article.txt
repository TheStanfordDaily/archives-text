# Chappie Due On Thursday Says Old Boy
## 
### 
The Daily clamped down on Chap- '
arral's Copp for a statement yes
i terday, Copp clamped down on his
, teeth, and as a result the freshman ,
i issue of the campus humor mag will
j come out this Thursday.
The 1935 model Old Boy was
| found on the local golf links trying i
I out some new shots. He had a ball
j neatly teed up and was swinging at
, it with a four-and-a-half foot caddy.
When questioned as to the rauon for
I this informal procedure, the editor
! replied that he got so much more
! distance; besides "it saves wear and
tear on the clubs." And that, you'll
j have to admit, was awfully sound
' reasoning. He held the caddy up for
| all to see.
"Look, you can get a better grip, i
| too."
The caddy, being rather uncon- '
â– scious, apparently didn't mind in !
! the least. After all, it was a living.
"Some Chappie," said the Old Boy i
I in his wild exultation of the great !
i things in store for the new issue, to \
| say nothing of the way the students ;
are going to feel when they see the '
i first issue. Maybe the less said about i
1 this the better.
Carefully dotting his eyes and
j crossing his tees, Chappie Copp |
. pointed out that the first of the new
volume would feature such notables
ias Gordie ex-Old Boy Steedman,
i Dorman H. Smith, Gilman Gist, and
! Jean Piouverol.
