COAST CONFERENCE
ON TOP AGAIN
Before last Saturday's grid activ
ities, the Coast Conference looked as
though it were taking a back seat to
the independents. There seemed to
be three leading teams on the coast.
Two of them, Santa Clara and St.
Mary's, weren't conference members.
One, Stanford, was.
And at that time the prospects
weren't any too bright for the con
ference teams, either. Washington
was expected to be whipped by the
Broncs, and it was generally be
lieved that California wouldn't
stand up against Slip Madigan's
Galloping Gaels.
But they did. Up north the Hus
kies played a brand of tough,
smashing ball that saw one Bronc
carried oil the turf with a broken
leg ami a lot of other Santa Clar
ans hanged up. That was the ball
club Jimmy Phclan has been re
ferring to as "small and larking
any sort of punch."
Santa Clara could make but twu
first downs against the Huskies and
in most every field were well out
classed. And before that meeting
they were rated next to Stanford as
the coast's best.
But they still are going to be hard
for the Indians to handle and Wash
ington, after all we've been hearing
about last Saturday's toughness, is
going to be even harder.
BEARS BOOST
CONFERENCESTRENGTH
Then over at Berkeley, Saturday,
another conference team upset the
non-conference, and raised itself
from a near cellar position to the top.
That was when those mighty Bears
rose to the occasion and dropped a
highly-touted Saint eleven 10-0.
It was a neat display of the
popular football occurrence—the
underdog comes through — and
after the words and words and
columns and columns of talk
about Slip Madigan's powerful,
unstoppable backs, we can't help
but doll" our headdresses to those
Cal linemen who showed real
fight.
Here we've been boosting Cali
fornia and Washington and before
long they'll be causing Stanford a
lot of worry. But the Bears and
Huskies were a lot better than was
commonly believed and from now on
they'll be getting their credit due.
And later in the season when ihs
big conference games come off they'll
really be tough meetings; not just
reminders of the days when Coast
Conference teams were the big guns.
They still are. —Frost

be three leading teams on the coast.
Two of them, Santa Clara and St.
Mary's, weren't conference members.
One, Stanford, was.
And at that time the prospects
weren't any too bright for the con
ference teams, either. Washington
was expected to be whipped by the
Broncs, and it was generally be
lieved that California wouldn't
stand up against Slip Madigan's
Galloping Gaels.
But they did. Up north the Hus
kies played a brand of tough,
smashing ball that saw one Bronc
carried oil the turf with a broken
leg ami a lot of other Santa Clar
ans hanged up. That was the ball
club Jimmy Phclan has been re
ferring to as "small and larking
any sort of punch."
Santa Clara could make but twu
first downs against the Huskies and
in most every field were well out
classed. And before that meeting
they were rated next to Stanford as
the coast's best.
But they still are going to be hard
for the Indians to handle and Wash
ington, after all we've been hearing
about last Saturday's toughness, is
going to be even harder.
BEARS BOOST
CONFERENCESTRENGTH
Then over at Berkeley, Saturday,
another conference team upset the
non-conference, and raised itself
from a near cellar position to the top.
That was when those mighty Bears
rose to the occasion and dropped a
highly-touted Saint eleven 10-0.
It was a neat display of the
popular football occurrence—the
underdog comes through — and
after the words and words and
columns and columns of talk
about Slip Madigan's powerful,
unstoppable backs, we can't help
but doll" our headdresses to those
Cal linemen who showed real
fight.
Here we've been boosting Cali
fornia and Washington and before
long they'll be causing Stanford a
lot of worry. But the Bears and
Huskies were a lot better than was
commonly believed and from now on
they'll be getting their credit due.
And later in the season when ihs
big conference games come off they'll
really be tough meetings; not just
reminders of the days when Coast
Conference teams were the big guns.
They still are. —Frost
COAST CONFERENCE
ON TOP AGAIN
Before last Saturday's grid activ
ities, the Coast Conference looked as
though it were taking a back seat to
the independents. There seemed to
be three leading teams on the coast.
Two of them, Santa Clara and St.
Mary's, weren't conference members.
One, Stanford, was.
And at that time the prospects
weren't any too bright for the con
ference teams, either. Washington
