# Coaches Satisfied By Track Tryouts
## 
### 
Friday afternoon informal track
tryouts were held in the stadium,
and while early season incondition
was apparent, the coaches expressed
themselves as well pleased with the
results.
High spots of the meet were
Humbert Smith's high jump of 6
feet 3 inches, followed by Morrison
and Nordham at 6 feet, Voight and
Tharp's leaps of over 22 feet in the
broad jump, and Weirhauser's dash
over approximately 352 yards in 39.5
seconds.
Indiana state police are patrolling
the highways now for the first time.
