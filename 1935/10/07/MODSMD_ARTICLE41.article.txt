# Zagar Stars as Freshmen Beat Sacramento
## Penalties Crab Yearlings' Win From Jaysees Fay and Garnier Perform In Running Plays 
### Bob Leland 
Big Pete Zagar performed in a i
highly creditable manner at left !
tackle for the Frosh Saturday. So ,
creditably, in fact, that although the
Papooses showed little to deserve a
victory, they eked out a 7-0 win over 1
Sacramento J.C.
Zagar was just about the whole |
show. He spent a great deal of time
inspecting the operation of the Sac
ramento backfield at close range.
Midway in the first period, while on
one of his inspection tours, he grab
bed a poorly thrown lateral and gal- j
loped 45 yards to score. Ed Gamier |
converted, and that was that.
Frosh Penalized
During the rest of the game, the !
yearlings fussed around and didn't i
really get started until late in the '
fourth quarter, when, with Pete Fay 1
doing some nice bail lugging, they I
scored two first downs. However, a j
15-yard holding penalty put a stop i
to that threat, as had previous pen- !
alties for taking too long in huddles, j
being off-side, and clipping.
Once Fay took a punt on his i
own 40, ran a few steps, and tossed I
a lateral to Bill Kirsch, who re
versed his field and ran 55 yards I
to score. A clipping penalty ruined I
the run, however.
On another occasion, when it
seemed that the Babes might gel '
started, a penalty for too much time
in the huddle halted things. Fay had '
just wiggled and cut through the
Jaysee team for some 30 yards. Came j
the signal mix-up, a try at the line, j
and three passes fizzled.
Papoose Back Star
Two San Francisco boys showed
some of the real McCoy on more than '
! one occasion. Kirsch, especially at
| defensive right halfback, gave a fine
j performance. Several times he
I dashed in from his wing back posi
j t ion to cut down Jaysee runners
j when it seemed they might break
| into the clear. Fay, running from the
i left halfback position, showed flash -
j es of brilliance, and proved a hard
I man to bring down. He kept twisting
and fighting and adding yards when
he might have been stopped. He
fumbled a punt late in the game, but
a little more experience should cure
him of that fault.
At times the first-string line
seemed invincible, but the second
stringers had trouble holding the
Jaysee attack, which gained a lot
of ground in midfield. On one oc
casion, the l'rosh held on the two
yard line for four downs.
Walt Hege and Irv Cummings, be
fore he reinjured his ankle, looked
good at the ends. Dave Carnahan
played some good defensive ball at
right, tackle. Dick Sutton played
fine ball at center, intercepting a
pass on one of the Jaysee thrusts at
the Frosh goal. Guards Fred Gus
tafson and Jack McMillan were
strong on defense.
The starting line-up: Hege and
Cummings, ends; Carnahan and Za
| gar, tackles; Gustafson and McMil
lan, guards; Cutton, center; Gamier,
quarterback; Huebel and Kirsch,
halfbacks; deWitt, fullback.
