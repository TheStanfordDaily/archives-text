# Dibble, Hanna Hurt In Soccer Practice
## 
### 
Two first-string players were lost
to the varsity soccer team Saturday
as a result of injuries sustained in
practice.
A1 Dibble, inside right, was car
ried from the field with a broken
ankle after a melee in mid-field, and
Dick Hanna, sophomoi'e halfback.

I was forced out of play with a se
verely sprained ankle. Dibble will
be out for the season, but Hanna
I may be able to play late in the
year.
Notre Dame's nickname, "Fighting
Irish," may be a reality this season
â€¢ for the first time in years; of the
1110 vai'sity candidates, 55 have Irish
J blood.
