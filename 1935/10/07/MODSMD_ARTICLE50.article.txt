# "Let the Winds of Freedom Blow"
## Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily Member of the Associated Press Question Arises of Compensation for Encina Sponsors and Not for Roble 
### 
In a contribution to today's "Vox Carnpi"
column, a former sponsor points out that
Roble sponsors are asked to give of their serv
ices gratis, while those in Encina are given
a free room in return for their advisory and
disciplinary work among frosh men.
This brings up a question that has arisen
several times in the past few years and which
should be considered from every angle and
settled once and for all.
Women sponsors on the average contribute
more of their time to the advising of freshmen
than do their colleagues in Encina, the former
sponsor explains. The women are expected
to be available for questioning fro in their
charges most of the day and night, and, in
addition, are called upon to attend numerous
time-consuming functions. In their spare mo
ments the sponsors are expected to mingle
with the freshman women and help them ad
just themselves to college life.
On the other hand, as explained by Dean
Mary Yost, the sponsor system was originally
established by a group of women who vol

unteered their services because they felt that
they wanted to contribute their help to the
new women who were just beginning thir
college careers. Stanford men took up the
plan later, but their duties were more of a
disciplinary nature, and they served more as
University employees than as freshman ad
visers.
It has further been argued that the sys
tem would sutler il the sponsors were given
free room, in that the question of need would
interfere in the selection of sponsors. How
ever, several women in the past few years
have been forced to turn down bids because
they claimed they could not alford to put in
the required time without some compensation.
It would appear that the present spon
sorial system has become just as important
a factor in the administration of Roble and
other halls as it has at Encina. On the basis
of this assumption, it seems that the women
should get the same treatment as that given
the men. At any rate, the problem is worthy
of thorough consideration and a linal esttle
ment one way or the other.
