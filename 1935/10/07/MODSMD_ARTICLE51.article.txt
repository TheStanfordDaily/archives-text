# Faculty Mannerisms Irk Students and Vice Versa
## 
### 
Having read an account of what queer
mannerisms were discovered to be exhibited
by South Carolina's faculty, many students
have been looking inquiringly at their profes
sors. On the whole, Stanford probably found
its average faculty specimen somewhat less
weird than that of South Carolina, but in
clined in a degree to the same failings.
Some of the more observing students saw
that the recurring mannerism problem cuts
both ways. True, professors' pet phrases, re
peated mannerisms, and unconscious habits
often grate on students out of proportion to
their intrinsic nuisance value, but similarly,
it is easy to imagine how irked the profesosr
must get at yearly repetitions of examples of
student apathy, laziness, stupidity, and slov
enly habits.
Student-faculty relations at Stanford are
no longer on the near-ideal plane on which
they once lay when the University was young
and small, and 1 acuity and student body were
just one big, happy family. That friction
sometimes arises was clearly brought out in
last spring's student panel discussions. This
quarter's student discussions will probably
run into the same problem but possibly with
some solution being brought to the fore.
