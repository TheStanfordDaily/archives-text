Last Saturday's rooters furnished a reason
ably good example of a well-behaved, normal
college rooting section, with booing at an even
better than normal low. However, when the
section prepared to break up, there was an
amazing lack of clarity in the singing of the
hymn.
Staying after athletic contests to sing a
hymn is usually considered an excellent mark
of respect to one's alma mater. But it ceases
to be such il only a negligible proportion of
people actually know and sing the hymn.
At Stanford, even students who conduct
themselves uprighteouslv and show a proper

respect for traditions of the t'niversitv, lincl
themselves mush-mouthed and embarrassed
when the hymn is sung.
This is not entirely their fault, however,
since there is no organized method on the
Farm for teaching the hymn to them when
they enter, or when they stay for their college
years.
Possibly one of the branches of the A.S.S.U.
government could devise something to remedy
the fault—other schools have. An organized
system of instruction might be able to make
the hymn a live thing again, not a hollow shell.
