Here's a sad, sad story of the deliberate flaunting of
Stanford traditions, and you can't blame it on the frosh.
If Our Hasher's information is correct, there is a certain
sophomore, who came back to school this year with a
glittering, tremendous La Salle coupe.
This certain sophomore sets out all alone every
morning from Paly for his 8 o'clock in his long, shiny,
glittering, tremendous coupe, and roars past the tra
ditional share-the-wealth hitch-hike stand by the
S.P. tracks, all alone in his regal splendor, while
worthy Stanford roughs stand forsaken and desolate at
the Transit Customer's Last Stand.
The reports have it that every morning now, when
the certain sophomore sets out all alone for his 8
o'clock in his long, shiny, glittering, tremendous coupe,
and roars past the Customers' Last Stand, that there is
a great cheer that wells up from the throats of the
waiting roughs, and its does not in the least resemble:
"We Love Thee, California."
Another story about a long, shiny car involves a
woman who transgressed the local laws in regard to
conduct becoming a Stanford woman when behind a
steering wheel and ran up against the unimpeachable
Gordon Davis and his four-cylinder Chameleon. While
the estimable Davis was making out the tag, the little
lady used all the wiles of feminine art, including ogling
and googling with long lashes.
But as soon as the tag was made out and the un
impeachable Davis handed it to her, she grabbed it out
of his hand, pranced over to her car, slammed the
door, and uttered many words, some of which were
not included in the King James' version of the
Scriptures.
Officer Burns of the Black Watch answered a riot
call Saturday night at the Alpha Delt house. For
many moons now, the Alpha Phis, next door, have
spent many sleepless nights, because Alpha Delta Phi's
foot ball player snored. But the crisis approached Sat
urday, when the football player, reinforced by several
of the Knob Hill branch chapter, did some wide-awake
snoring, mixed with several caustic comments, which
included the regular Alpha Phi bottle-cry, which un
fortunately, is unprintable here.
Officer Burns brought some order out of the fracas
by asking the boys if they wished to "sleep down
town tonight." But the boys declined the kind invi
tation. and reciprocated by asking him if he wished
to sleep at the house. Burns refused also, intimating
that it wasn't safe.
