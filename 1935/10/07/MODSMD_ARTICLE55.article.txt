# Huey: His University
## HUEY LONG BOSSES HIS SCHOOL 
### 
If in 1933 there was any doubt as to who was run
ning Louisiana State University, there should not
have been. Senator Huey Pierce Long was in the saddle
through his henchman, Governor Oscar K. Allen.
University President Thomas W. Atkinson had not
seen eye to eye with the senator—he resigned. Dean
of the Law School Robert L. Tullis had disagreed with
Long—he was retired. Senator Long later fired the
football coach and the bandmaster after "misunder
standings."
Notwithstanding these arbitrary acts, Senator Long
obviously thought he was acting in the best interests
of the University. He wanted a great educational in
stitution and he believed these men stood in the way
of his dream. He wanted the school to win football
games, have a crack band, and offer all kinds of
courses at a charge so low that any boy could hope
for a college education regardless of his poverty.
* # * *
Whether he acted unjustly is a question Long-rhen
and anti-Long-men will always argue. But it is im
portant to note that Huey Long's activities within the
University were non-politcial. Most of the professors
were politically opposed to the senator. None were
dismissed or held back for this reason. True, he did
jibe these educators unmercifully. He even publicly
appealed to the student body, during commencement
exercises, not to imitate their teachers too closely
"'cause they ain't got the sense to vote right."
Dean Tullis was supposed to have been retired be
cause he refused to sign a law-school diploma for a
student who had been dishonorably discharged from
the University for publishing an allegedly libelous
paper. The student received a prison sentence but was
pardoned by Governor Long. Long felt the boy had
been sufficiently punished and wanted him to get his
degree as all the work required for it had been com
pleted. Dean Tullis, on the other hand, did not believe
the former student qualified to practice law and re
fused to sign the diploma. President Atkinson backed
him up.

The head football coach had done a splendid job
in his three years. Until December 1, 1934, the Tigers
had not lost a conference game under the Jones regime.
Then Tulane in the last four minutes of play won a
surprise victory. The next week Tennessee defeated
L.S.U. Huey, who had boasted that his University had
the best football team in the country, was furious.
During the half period of the third post-season game
Long's rage reached its height. Oregon and L.S.U. had
both been unable to score but the Oregon team had
clearly shown its superiority. Long wanted to make a
pep talk to his team. "Biff" Jones would not permit
this and a bitter argument ensued. L.S.U. defeated
Oregon but Long and Jones could not forget their
words. Captain Jones resigned.
Except for these scattered incidents, Huey Long
did not interfere with the faculty or courses of the
University in any way. Probably if anyone else had
been involved these occurrences would never have
been noticed but Long was a colorful figure and his
slightest act was news.

Whether he acted unjustly is a question Long-rhen
and anti-Long-men will always argue. But it is im
portant to note that Huey Long's activities within the
University were non-politcial. Most of the professors
were politically opposed to the senator. None were
dismissed or held back for this reason. True, he did
jibe these educators unmercifully. He even publicly
appealed to the student body, during commencement
exercises, not to imitate their teachers too closely
"'cause they ain't got the sense to vote right."
Dean Tullis was supposed to have been retired be
cause he refused to sign a law-school diploma for a
student who had been dishonorably discharged from
the University for publishing an allegedly libelous
paper. The student received a prison sentence but was
pardoned by Governor Long. Long felt the boy had
been sufficiently punished and wanted him to get his
degree as all the work required for it had been com
pleted. Dean Tullis, on the other hand, did not believe
the former student qualified to practice law and re
fused to sign the diploma. President Atkinson backed
him up.

The head football coach had done a splendid job
in his three years. Until December 1, 1934, the Tigers
had not lost a conference game under the Jones regime.
Then Tulane in the last four minutes of play won a
surprise victory. The next week Tennessee defeated
L.S.U. Huey, who had boasted that his University had
the best football team in the country, was furious.
During the half period of the third post-season game
Long's rage reached its height. Oregon and L.S.U. had
both been unable to score but the Oregon team had
clearly shown its superiority. Long wanted to make a
pep talk to his team. "Biff" Jones would not permit
this and a bitter argument ensued. L.S.U. defeated
Oregon but Long and Jones could not forget their
words. Captain Jones resigned.
Except for these scattered incidents, Huey Long
did not interfere with the faculty or courses of the
University in any way. Probably if anyone else had
been involved these occurrences would never have
been noticed but Long was a colorful figure and his
slightest act was news.

If in 1933 there was any doubt as to who was run
ning Louisiana State University, there should not
have been. Senator Huey Pierce Long was in the saddle
through his henchman, Governor Oscar K. Allen.
University President Thomas W. Atkinson had not
seen eye to eye with the senator—he resigned. Dean
of the Law School Robert L. Tullis had disagreed with
Long—he was retired. Senator Long later fired the
football coach and the bandmaster after "misunder
standings."
Notwithstanding these arbitrary acts, Senator Long
obviously thought he was acting in the best interests
of the University. He wanted a great educational in
stitution and he believed these men stood in the way
of his dream. He wanted the school to win football
games, have a crack band, and offer all kinds of
courses at a charge so low that any boy could hope
for a college education regardless of his poverty.
