## THE 						BRAIN BUST 
### 
Perhaps only professors, of all
j classes affected by the New Deal,
can point to a definite gain under
Roosevelt policies. Though with big
business and labor, America's acad
j emicians have also been flayed alive, !
}at least they have emerged with
j something better than nothing—an
j idea of their status in this civiliza
tion.
* * *
It wasn't so many years ago when
I the professorial college minds of
America joined with fear-stricken
big business and hysterical labor in
I a swelling endorsement of F.D.R. For
! the President, they believed, by au
j thorizing a group of professors as his
advisers, at last recognized the Pla
tonic principle of philosophic rule.
Facetious Washington correspond
| ents, intuitively sensed a very likely
I public reaction, dubbed the group
the "Brain Trust." They joined one
| unpleasant word, likely to conjure
j up pictures of wild-haired nuts, with
j another one still potent to old
| timers.
; The "Brain Trust" started, stag
j gered, then stopped. From what
i happened to their representatives on
| this first board of exclusively brainy
men, professors can deduce not only
a restatement of what big business
thinks of them, but, more important
ly, how they stack up with the rank
and file of America.
From its first day, the brain trust
had the contempt of the nation's
high financiers. But that contempt
1 was expected. Everyone knew that
J industrial leaders were too used to
| dictating to professorial brains in
factory labs to permit the tables to
j be turned without a squawk.

But the brain trust also annoyed
the public. Its dissolution as a power
in the administration demonstrates
not only the attitude of American
financiers, but the strength of public
prejudice against professorial activ
: ity outside the university.
It shows the firmness of the social
mores classifying professors with
clergymen—both as interesting and
brilliant types, but as individuals too
i gentle to whip the economic horse to
| action.
It re-demonstrates the fact that
; any literate crackpot capable of
earning a living regards himself as
the professor's economic superior,
and by easy extension, his intellec
tual superior in things not strictly
j of classroom theory.

It restates the popular belief that
all a professor writes and says is
popularly regarded as stuff manu
factured in fulfillment of a contract,
stuff which may be examined and
rejected (with its maker) by th_>
public, who indirectly keeps the
professor in bed and board.
* * *
Taken all in all, public reaction
showed that the professor is still re
garded somewhat as a high priest
conducting mysterious rites in the
temples of learning. True, he is a
brilliant man and an interesting one,
but somehow his calling prevents his
being a practical man who can deal
with the workaday troubles of the
world.
The professor, who saw some
thing greater beyond Roosevelt's
early recognition — riddance of the
public in his personal equation —
found himself back where he started
from with the dinging of the brain
trust.
Today, he faces no apparent alter
native between public life and schol
astic life. The busting of the brain
trust seems to show that his socially
ordained place is the campus, just as
it was 2000 years ago when Plato
was a teacher.
