## Economics, Family Law Volume Due Soon 
### 
The University Press continues
its publication of new books with
two books which are to be brought
of! the press in the near future.
These are "International Economics
and Diplomacy in the Near East," a
study of British commercial policy
in the Levant, 1834-1853, and "Amer
ican Family Laws, Vol. Ill: Hus
band and Wife."
The former written by Vernon J.
Puryear, professor of history, Hum
boldt State College, Areata, Calif.,
tells of the economic and other fac
tors, which ruled the period arid
demonstrates in detail the connec
tion which existed between the
great powers. In this work the
Crimean War receives a thorough
analysis long looked for.
Dr. Puryear, the author of this
book, spent a year in the archives
of the various countries concerned
in this specific period of history in
vestigating the subject of this vol
ume on "International Economics
and Diplomacy in the Near East."
Chester G. Vernier, professor of
law at Stanford, is the author of
"American Family Laws, Vol. Ill:
Husband and Wife." He is assisted
in writing this work by John B.
Hurlbut.
This book is the third volume of a
proposed five-volume set which will
constitute a study of the field of
domestic relations. These volumes,
when completed, will set forth
American family laws accurately
and will be a comparative survey of
the family laws of the 48 American
states, Alaska, the District of Co
lumbia, and Hawaii.
