# WHY DISCRIMINATION?
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
As a one-time Roble sponsor, j
there is a question to which I should I
greatly appreciate an answer. My •
time is past, and what interest I I
have in the matter is unfortunately j
not one of personal financial gain I
but is purely in the interest of seeing i
justice supreme down on the Farm. I
The question: Why do women |
sponsors take the job? I was told, as
were sponsors before and after me,
that it was for the sake of honor,
fame, and glory, but as far as I can
see there is something definitely i
wrong in a system that pays men !
for the honor and not women.
Not that I am a woman suffrag- }
ette, waving banners, wearing flat
heels on my feet and a militant ex
pression on my face. Especially
would I like to know the answer,
since Roble sponsors undoubtedly
spend a great deal more time and
effort on freshmen than do the so
called policemen of Encina. I'd
really like to know if the reason our i
sponsors get no compensation in ;
contrast to that given men sponsors '
is because they are women or mere
ly because no one has gotten around j
to it? If not, why not?
