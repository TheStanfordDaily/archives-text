# MUD IN OUR EYES
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
I have been naive enough to be
lieve the Daily an intelligent paper, j
without prejudice or undue coloring I
of the news. But I am sure I speak 1
for my entire class when I protest
at the puerile display of journalism
that masqueraded in Friday's paper
under the head "Yearlings Out
dunk Sophs in Mudfight."
Among other gross exaggerations,
this piece of "news" states that the
Class of '38 was "overwhelmed," |
neglecting to mention the score of
this crushing defeat, 68-70. It is true
that we were beaten, and fairly, by j
great odds and by tactics which
many believe were out of place in a i
tradition where valor has always
been considered the better part of
caution.
But it is evident that this unfair '
article was written by a frosh try- '
outee reveling in the glory of vie- !
tory. Perhaps the Daily can secure j
the services of Mussolini as their j
Ethiopian correspondent.

Mussolini seems to have his
hands full right now.â€”Ed.
