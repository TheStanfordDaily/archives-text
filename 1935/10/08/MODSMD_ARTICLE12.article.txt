# Today Last Time To Change Study Lists without Fine
## 
### 
Today is the last time for students
to change their study lists without
fine. Any change made after today
requires the permission of the Reg
istration Committee and the payment
of either a $2 fine for each course
added or dropped and a $!5 fine for
any substitution of courses.
All revisions of study programs
must be made on the appropriate
blanks, obtained from and filed at
the Registrar's office. Otherwise,
students will be held responsible for
courses and units appearing on the
official study lists, filed at the time
;of registration. No credit can be
given for physical education or
academic subjects not appearing on
either official study lists or revised
I study cards.
