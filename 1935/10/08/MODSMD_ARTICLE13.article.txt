# 'Steam Engine Helped Science,' Says Koenig

"The steam engine did more for
science than science ever did for
| the steam engine," said Dr. Fred-
I erick Otto Koenig on the Stanford
j Radio Hour over station KGO last
i night, on the topic "The Debt of
| Science to the Steam Engine."
The professor of chemistry con
! tinued, saying that before a useful
! theory of the steam engine was pos
sible, there had to be created ther
| modynamics, an entire branch of
science, with implications that
I reached far beyond the steam en
j gine.
As the result of the work of Sadi
, Carnot with the steam engine, the

second law of thermodynamics was
discovered, and was brought forth
in a paper "Reflections on the mo
tive power of heat and on the en
gines suitable for developing this
power."
Carnot's work had little effect,
however, until some years later
when the first law of thermodynam
ics was discovered, that of the con
servation of energy.
Dr. Koenig concluded his talk by
pointing out that in the last cen
tury and a half the steam en√üine
has revolutionized human life, and
that in reality it has influenced the
course of scientific discovery in a
way that is unique and profound.
