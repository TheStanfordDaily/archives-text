# Men's Council Holds Meeting
## 
### 
The initial meeting of Men's
Council under the chairmanship of
Bob Gros went on record yesterday
afternoon with a two-hour session
on speeding and parking offenses
alone. Although a few speeding
cases were heard, the majority were
violations of the laws prohibiting
parking in front of the Daily office
and in front of and across the street
from the post office.
Gros announced that if for any le
gitimate reason offenders are unable
to appear to answer their citations
at the scheduled time, extensions
will be granted and the cases heard
at the next meeting. These men must
obtain this permission from Gros
personally, however.
In view of the election of a new
member to Council today, any dis
cussion of the honor code was de
ferred until later in the week when
a series of meetings will be held in
Encina to instruct the freshman
class on the responsibilities of the
student under the honor system at
Stanford.
