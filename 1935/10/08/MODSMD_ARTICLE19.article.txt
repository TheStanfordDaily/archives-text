# F.D.R. Reviews Practice 'War'
## Navy Stages 'Battle' For President's Party 
### 
EN ROUTE WITH PRESIDENT ;
ROOSEVELT, Aboard U.S.S. Port
land, at Sea, Oct. 7 (/I s ). —The cruis
ers Houston and Portland—bearing j
members of President Roosevelt's j
party—went to war today in the Pa- j
cific under the interested gaze of |
President Roosevelt. But it was all j
for practice.
The Houston, with the President
aboard, slipped over the western
horizon this morning off the coast of |
Lower Mexico, and the crews of the j
two navy fighters engaged in "bat- j
tie" by long distance range finders.
They trained their powerful
guns on each other within firing J
range, but out of sight. So far as
could he determined, the "war" !
was a draw. After an hour of |
fighting, the Houston again pulled
alongside the Portland to lead the
way on to Cocos Island for a two
day stay. Arrival is expected to be
Wednesday morning.
Meanwhile, the President follow
ed radio accounts of national and in
ternational affairs from his cabin
study.
