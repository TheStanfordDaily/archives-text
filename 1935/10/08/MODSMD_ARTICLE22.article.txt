WITH THE ITALIAN ARMIES
IN THE FIELD, ADUWA, Ethiopia,
Oct. 7 (IP). —Benito Mussolini's gen
erals fortified their new-won lines
and held their eager armies in leash
on the northern Ethiopian front to
night.
The blackshirts, fresh from their
avenging capture of Aduwa, were
anxious to press on into the land of
the hated "Negus"—Emperor Haile
Selassie. Their officers restrained
their enthusiasm with difficulty,
knowing too rapid an advance would
mean loss of lives.
It seemed possible the armies
would spend some days consolidat
ing their positions along the line
from Adigrat to Aduwa before strik
ing again.
Nevertheless, the Ethiopian war
riors must be driven from the moun
tains directly behind Aduwa, and the
Italian artillery will proceed to do
so.
Prince Adalberto, Duke of Ber
gamo, visited genex-al headquarters
today after seeing his division to
advanced lines.
The armies dug in carefully to
meet the menace of savage enemy
warriors, reported massing in the
mountains to the south of Aduwa.
Crude roads swarmed with re
serves, moving up to the front es
tablished Sunday when the black
shirt hordes poured proudly through
the gates of Aduwa to blot out the
shame of this 39-year-old landmark
of Italian defeat.
