# Amateurs Tap All Night To Cover Radio World
## 
### DAVE BOTSFORD 
To many a man and boy, operat
ing an amateur transmitting and re
ceiving station is a pride and joy;
sitting up all night tap, tap, tapping
to Australia, about the only thing in
life. For just such "hams" (amateur
operators) was the Stanford Radio
Club formed when amateur wireless
came into popularity some 10 years
ago.
Located in the communications
laboratory of the electrical engineer
ing building, the club's station
W6YX consists of a 40-meter trans
mitter of 500-watt power built last
year by members from spare equip
ment. Enough parts were found to
build two more transmitters this
coming year, one for the 20-meter
frequency band, the other for the
80-meter band.
Members of the club, who must
hold amateur licenses, can use the
transmitter at any time. Radio en
thusiasts without licenses can be
come associate members until they
are experienced enough to pass the
test.
Principal work of the club and its
station last spring was its part in
the successful radio news service be
tween the Daily and the Southern

California Daily Trojan. The Daily
hopes to extend the service to Uni
versity of California, U.C.L.A., and
northern universities.
Before this CIPA news service
came along to occupy the members'
transmitting time, the club sent
messages for students to all parts of
the United States, Hawaii, and
Alaska. If W6YX had a definite
sending schedule—a certain time set
when both sending and receiving
stations would be tuned in—with a
"ham" station in the city where the
message was to go, it reached the
addressee nearly 100 per cent of the
time. Otherwise there was about an
80 per cent chance that the mes
sage would be delivered.
Troubling the club now is the mat
ter of members. Bill Sutherlin,
president; Bill Sharp, faculty advis
er, and J. Berwin Mott, secretary,
hope that amateur operators or those
training for a license will Come to the
club's first meeting today at 5 o'clock
in Room 500H, second floor of the
electrical engineering building.
Election of officers and club or
ganization for the year will be offi
cial business; making new friend:-
' among "hams," unofficial business.

To many a man and boy, operat
ing an amateur transmitting and re
ceiving station is a pride and joy;
sitting up all night tap, tap, tapping
to Australia, about the only thing in
life. For just such "hams" (amateur
operators) was the Stanford Radio
Club formed when amateur wireless
came into popularity some 10 years
ago.
Located in the communications
laboratory of the electrical engineer
ing building, the club's station
W6YX consists of a 40-meter trans
mitter of 500-watt power built last
year by members from spare equip
ment. Enough parts were found to
build two more transmitters this
coming year, one for the 20-meter
frequency band, the other for the
80-meter band.
Members of the club, who must
hold amateur licenses, can use the
transmitter at any time. Radio en
thusiasts without licenses can be
come associate members until they
are experienced enough to pass the
test.
Principal work of the club and its
station last spring was its part in
the successful radio news service be
tween the Daily and the Southern

California Daily Trojan. The Daily
hopes to extend the service to Uni
versity of California, U.C.L.A., and
northern universities.
Before this CIPA news service
came along to occupy the members'
transmitting time, the club sent
messages for students to all parts of
the United States, Hawaii, and
Alaska. If W6YX had a definite
