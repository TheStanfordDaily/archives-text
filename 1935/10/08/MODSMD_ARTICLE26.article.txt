That the United States may be in
volved in another World War as an
indirect result of Mussolini's con
quest of Ethiopia was the declara- I
tion yesterday of Dr. Graham Stu
art, professor of political science at 1
Stanford.
Basing his statement on latest dis- ;
patches received by The Daily
through Associated Press, Dr. Stuart I
said that sanctions providing sev- ;
erance of diplomatic relations be- i
tween members of the League of
Nations and the establishment of a '
financial boycott on Italy were ef- i
fective automatically with Musso
lini's declared violation of the
League's non-aggression pact.
U.S. Bound by League
"With these sanctions invoked, the
! United States is in the unusual posi
tion of not being a League member,
but in many ways forced to abide by
League rulings," he said.
"If the economic blockade now in
| effect between other member na
; tions and Italy is extended to trade
between the United States and
Italy, this nation will find ob
servance of League dictums ex
tremely advisable, though not itself
a League member," he declared.
All goods sent to Italy from this
country under a blockade would be
j contraband in the eyes of League
members, and seizable as such, Dr.
j Stuart said. "The question is, would
i we fight for our right to trade as a
| neutral nation, or would we allow
I American shipments to be confis
i cated without promise of redress?"
Automatic War
If Washington militantly objects,
: we will automatically be at war with
! all League members save Italy, he
said.
"My own guess, however, is that
blockading nations would buy our
confiscated goods at market prices, a
wide practice with neutral contra
band shipping during the World
War."
Anticipating such a crisis in
American diplomatic relations,
President Roosevelt has already
prohibited shipment of arms to Italy
or Ethiopia and the use by Ameri
cans of belligerent passenger vessels,
I Dr. Stuart pointed out. If the istua
tion warrants, the President may
also prohibit any shipments to Italy,
according to mandatory powers
