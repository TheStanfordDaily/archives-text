# War for U.S. Held Possible By Dr. Stuart

That the United States may be in
volved in another World War as an
indirect result of Mussolini's con
quest of Ethiopia was the declara- I
tion yesterday of Dr. Graham Stu
art, professor of political science at 1
Stanford.
Basing his statement on latest dis- ;
patches received by The Daily
through Associated Press, Dr. Stuart I
said that sanctions providing sev- ;
erance of diplomatic relations be- i
tween members of the League of
Nations and the establishment of a '
financial boycott on Italy were ef- i
fective automatically with Musso
lini's declared violation of the
League's non-aggression pact.
U.S. Bound by League
"With these sanctions invoked, the
! United States is in the unusual posi
tion of not being a League member,
but in many ways forced to abide by
League rulings," he said.
"If the economic blockade now in
| effect between other member na
; tions and Italy is extended to trade
between the United States and
Italy, this nation will find ob
servance of League dictums ex
tremely advisable, though not itself
a League member," he declared.
All goods sent to Italy from this
country under a blockade would be
j contraband in the eyes of League
members, and seizable as such, Dr.
j Stuart said. "The question is, would
i we fight for our right to trade as a
| neutral nation, or would we allow
I American shipments to be confis
i cated without promise of redress?"
Automatic War
If Washington militantly objects,
: we will automatically be at war with
! all League members save Italy, he
said.
"My own guess, however, is that
blockading nations would buy our
confiscated goods at market prices, a
wide practice with neutral contra
band shipping during the World
War."
Anticipating such a crisis in
American diplomatic relations,
President Roosevelt has already
prohibited shipment of arms to Italy
or Ethiopia and the use by Ameri
cans of belligerent passenger vessels,
I Dr. Stuart pointed out. If the istua
tion warrants, the President may
also prohibit any shipments to Italy,
according to mandatory powers
| delegated to him by Congress in
August.
Meanwhile, Great Britain is prob
ably the most satisfied of all pow
erful League members with latest
League action, Dr. Stuart ventured.
I "While Mussolini claims his unde
j clared war with Ethiopia is merely
| a punitive expedition to preserve
| the peace of his adjacent colonies,
England views Italian military action
in Africa as a definite menace to her
i colonies there," Dr. Stuart declared,
i "Any action that may make the
i Italian conquest difficult, therefore,
I is greatly to the interests of Great
Britain."

i Haile Selassie stands at the
crossroads to independence or co
lonial serfdom, but the League, itself,
is facing the greatest crisis since its
establishment, Dr. Stuart said. "If
member nations refuse to enforce
j the sanctions once they are invoked,
I the League is through as an instru
' ment of national control," he pre
dicted.
Sanction, a word often read but
seldom understood, is nothing but a
means of enforcing wishes of League
members and provisions of the
League Covenant, just as a law is a
means of punishing violators and
enforcing the provisions of state and
federal constitutions, he explained.
There are three types of sanctions
provided for in the League Cove
nant. The first two types, ordering
j severance of diplomatic and eco-
I nomic relations, are automatic in
application, effective immediately
upon the League Council's naming
of an aggressor state, Dr. Stuart said.
"Use of the third sanction, mili-
I tary force, can only be invoked by
unanimous decision of the council,
although it is probable that no offi
cial invocation of this sanction
will be needed. If the League sev
ers other relations with a bel
ligerent state, the latter might very
reasonably attempt retaliation, an
action necessarily forcing the
League to force," he explained.
