# Sanctions Against Fascist State Compulsory, Says Council in Report
## 'Act of War' Declared Armed Force Ready If Peace Plans Fail 
### 
GENEVA, Oct. 7 (/P>.â€”'The coun
cil of the League of Nations solemn
ly pronounced the war of Italy
against Ethiopia "an act of war
against all other members of the
League" today and thus made sanc
tions agdinst the Fascist state com
pulsory.
It was the first time in league
history that a great power thus ar
raigned was found puilty of war
in violation of the covenant.
The council approved a report of
a committee of six holding that Italy
disregarded Article XII of the cove
nant by proceeding to war against
Ethiopia without waiting three
months for arbitration by the league.
Council members voting for the
report were Britain, Australia,
Chile, Denmark, Ecuador, Spain,
France, Poland, Portugal, Rumania,
Turkey, Russia, and Argentina.
Article XVI of the league pro
vides that members shall under
take to subject a violator of the
covenant to "severance of all trade
of financial relations and the pro
hibition of all intercourse between
their nationals and nationals of the
covenant-breaking State."
There also is an optional provision
i for employment of armed forces
I against a violator of the covenant.
I There was little likelihood this
would be applied except as a last
j resort.
The whole issue now goes to the
j assembly, which meets in "urgent"
, session Wednesday. It is expected a
co-ordinating committee consisting
of representatives of the assembly
and the council will be formed to
draw up a plan of economic sanc
tions against Italy and to fix the data
when they should apply.
