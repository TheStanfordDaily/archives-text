### 
CHEYENNE, Wyo., Oct. 7 (/P).â€”
A hillside crash which killed 12 per
sons in a huge New York-bound
luxury sky liner near here so baf
fled investigators tonipht that a
patheological examination of the
bodies of the two pilots was deter
mined upon.
Although some airmen, who de
clined to be quoted, scouted any the
ory that the crew was overcome by
carbon monoxide, Coroner Paul
Worland directed blood tests at the
county hospital.
Worland acknowledged that he
was entirely at a loss to explain the
tragic fate of the giant ship, nearing
the Cheyenne airdrome with a crack
pilot at the controls, clear weather,
and an apparently satisfactory radio.
A momentary mystery was cleared
by a San Francisco police announce
ment that one of the nine passen
gers originally identified as "Walter
Crandall," was, in reality, Robert H.
Renebome, a discharged employe of
the Associated Oil Company there,
who had purchased a ticket in the
name of "Crandall."
The casualties were: H. A. Col
lis-om, pilot; George Batty, co-pilot;
Leona Mason, stewardess; Juliet
Hillman; Charles H. Matthews, Jr.;
Mrs. Carolyn Cathcart; Ray Bane;
John F. Cushing; G. H. Miner, Vin
cent Butler; Helen Warren; and
Robert H. Benebome.
