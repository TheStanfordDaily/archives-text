### 
"STUDENTS' DAY"
TODAY AT PRACTICE
Tiny Thornhill suggested it, Head
Yell King Dick Stark hus planned
it, and its success rests in the hands
of Farm football followers.
That's the set-up of this "Students'
Day," which is slated to come off
on the varsity practice field at 4
this afternoon.
Early last month, before classes
had begun, Tiny, in an exclusive
Daily htory, asked that students
turn out to watch their gridmen
practice. He said it would help
the players, and spectators as well,
'lliat was the beginning.
Then Stark got to work, urged
students to turn out en masse to
practice yells, watch the team work,
and listen to the band do a little
practicing. That was last week and
the scheme met a disappointing end
when a handful, or less, showed up.
But today it's going to be tried
iigain. This time, if there is any
spirit in the Stanford student body,
it ought to meet with some success.
Stark promises to have his yell
leading forces on the lot ready to go.
They've doped out a new yell and are
all set to christen it this afternoon.
The band is slated to appear in
part, and has signified intention to
blow a tune or two. So there will
be music.
And Tiny has signified his inten
tion to send one of his teams
through some plays to give the on
lookers an idea of what happens
when Stanford makes five yards
through right tackle.
Then Tiny is also planning to
put his men through one of (heir
weekly scrimmage sessions, so
there will be some action, too.
Everything is all set to put Coach
Thornhill's suggestion into fact. And
if there are enough fans around the
Farm who'd like to see the big red
machine doing the real work that
earns them cheers on Saturdays,
Mr. Thornhill will be mighty
pleased.
THEY LIKE U.C.L.A.
AT PORTLAND
But audience or no audience
they're going to be doing some hard
work out there this afternoon and
it's just because on next Saturday
some mighty tough Bruins are going
to invade the Stanford stadium turf
with intentions of making off with
the Indians' scalp.
And there are a lot of people who
go so far as to believe that U.C.L.A.
will defeat Stanford. One of the
largest groups of those thinkers is
to be found in the good city of Port
land, Oregon, where the Uclans
whipped Oregon State 20-7 last Sat
urday.
Bobby Grayson talked to his
brother in Portland Sunday night
on the phone, and according to
brother Grayson the northern folk
are willing to bet even money that
U.C.L.A. will take Stanford.
But they've not seen the Indians in
operation this season so we'll dis
count some of their enthusiasm on
that score. Perhaps some of the citi
zens of Portland will lose money on
the Westwood boys Saturday.â€”Frost
