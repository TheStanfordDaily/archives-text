## Goose's Single Is Start Of Wildest Batting Spree in Series 
### 
NAVIN FIELD, Detroit, Oct. 7 (/Pi.
â€”Lean Allen Goslin, an amiable
New Jersey farmer known far and
wide as "the Goose," struck the $50,
000 blow today that carried De
troit's Tigers to their first world
championship in a slugging, rip
roaring finish to the baseball wars of
1935. With the score tied, two out
and Manager Mickey Cochrane on
j second base in the last half of the
ninth inning, the Goose produced
| (he golden base hit, a line single
' over the head of Billy Herman, star
; second baseman of the Chicago
Cubs, that brought Cochrane home
I with the deciding run.
Triumph for Bridges
! Goslin's winning hit off Larry
French, Cub southpaw, gave the
battling Bengals a 4-to-3 victory in
! the sixth game, and carried them
to triumph in the series by a margin
of four games to two and enabled
slim Tommy Bridges, curve ball
right-hander, to achieve his second
pitching conquest.
Coming after a brilliant stand by
Bridges, who stopped the Cubs -n
their half of the ninth after Stan
Hack had opened with a triple to
deepest center, the Goose's wallop
touched off one of the wildest home
town demonstrations any world
! series has witnessed.
Crowd Sets Record
The biggest crowd that has ever
seen a ball game in Detroit, 48,420
roaring fans who contributed to the
seventh million-dollar "gate" in
world series history and the third
| largest of all, poured out on tha
field the moment that Cochrane
j crossed the plate.
On the same field where they laid
| down a barrage of fruit and vege
j tables the year before, as the Cardi
nals were knocking the ears off the
home side, the Tiger bleacherites
swarmed to the diamond and started
1 a terrific uproar that was continued
far into the night.
It was a highly exciting and dra
matic climax to Deti'oit's long quest
J for the world championship.
It was the first Tiger triumph in
! five attempts.
Turned Back Four Times
Four times since the modern in
j terleague warfare began officially in
1 1905 Detroit has had its pennant
' winner turned back.
Twice the Cubs turned the trick,
in 1907 and 1908. The Pirates fol
lowed suit in 1909. Last year, the
city's first championship club in 25
j years was beaten back on its home
| grounds by the gas house gang of
St. Louis in a seven-game thriller,
l after returning home with a 3-to-2
lead.
