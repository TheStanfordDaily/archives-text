# Frosh Defense Pleases Coach
## 
### 
Expressing himself as satisfied
with the defensive showing of his
frosh gridders, Coach Jimmy Brad
shaw put the squad through a stiff
signal drill and chalk talk in prepa
ration for the U.S.C. frosh game two
weeks hence.
Besides the work on running plays,
ihe squad went through several
wild drills for conditioning. No
heavy work will be given till later
in the week.
Some changes have been made in
the line-up to replace two men who
were injured in the game against
Sacramento. Irv Cummings is out
p) obably till the U.S.C. game, and
Hank Huebel is out with an injured
side. Bill Hawkins has been moved
from right half to left end to replace
Cummings, while Henry Glasser,
formerly a quarterback, has been
moved to left halfback.
Bradshaw believes that much of
the offensive difficulty was due to
uncertain handling of the ball in the
backfield. The holes were there, but
a little delay in getting the ball car
rier through cut down the effective
ness. As soon as this timing im
proves, the frosh will roll better on
offensive.
For a first game, and considering
they had one week less of practice
than usual, they showed enough to
prove that no team will shove them
around.
