# Frosh Face Tough Water Polo Matches
## 
### 
While varsity water poloists are 1
busy preparing for Friday's tough
fracas with San Jose State, the fresh- !
man squad hasn't been a bit idle.
Included in their three-game sched
ule in three days are Sequoia High
School on Thursday afternoon, j
Athens Club reserves Friday night,
and a joust with the San Jose re- j
serves the following afternoon.
Coach Nort Thornton has been
working his charges hard this week j
and hopes to avenge a 5-3 defeat
handed them by the clubmen at their
last meeting. The Papoose outfit does
not expect quite as much opposition
from the high school aggregation.
Last year autos in the United
Spates killed more than 36,000.
