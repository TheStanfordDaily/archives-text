## Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily Member of the Associated Press Rough No Longer Need Worry About Hat-Check Tipping at Farm Dances 
### 
With this Saturday night's dance after the |
I'.C.L.A. game, the A.S.S.U. will see a new tra
dition put into practice, the ruling that win
announced last week —no tipping of coat
checkers at Stanford dances. That new policy j
will take its rightful place alongside the cus- J
torn of not sending corsages to members of the
1 100 for formal dances.
No longer need the Hough worry about |
shelling out a dime to the hat-and-coat-check- j
ers who greet him when he enters the wom
en's gym or clubhouse. The price of the bid
to the dance now covers that item.
As the Hough realizes, that cursed and an
••i i •
noying item of the traveler, tipping, will faze ,
him no more on the campus. Bothered as he 1
is with it in the city on his week-end expedi
tions, lie now finds a refuge on lite Farm. It
was bad enough to be bothered with dime

dispensing antics at hotels, but to have had
that pestering cutoni carried over into the
University was too much.
Hat checkers under the new scheme will
receive compensation in the form of n set
salary from the sponsors of the dance in
stead of from those students attending the
affair. The money needed to meet that ex
pense will he taken from the proceeds. Here
tofore, various individual arrangements had
been made with the checkers.
The student manager, hacked by the gradu
ate manager and the Ex Committee, acted
wisely, therefore, in placing the ban on tip
ping at the dances. The newly established
system should result in a far more satisfactory
arrangement to the Hough, besides setting up
for him the foundations for a new tradition
destined to receive the welcome backing of
the student body.
