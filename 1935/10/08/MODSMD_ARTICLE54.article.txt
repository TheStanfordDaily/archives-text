# Sponsors' Duties Are Too Important To Go Unrewarded
## 
### 
The raising of the question of free room
rent for Ruble sponsors lias brought into the
open many facts that seem to favor a plan to
compensate in some measure Ihc women ad
visers. These women, who have freely con
tributed their time to Ihe counseling of fresh
men unfamiliar with the ways of the Farm,
have come to serve a more useful and neces
sary function in the training and guidance of
new students.
The eleven Roble sponsors' duties are fully
as numerous and essential, from all appear
ances, as those performed by the eighteen En
ema advisers, who are provided with free
rooms in the ancient edifice in return for their
services. Roth groups supply a type of service
that is essential to the University—that of
guiding new students —and this is even more
of a service coining from students than it
would be if elderly matrons were employed
for the women in an advisory capacity, be
cause the appeal of an old student to a fresh
man can be more on the basis of equality.
The actual cash outlay necessary for the
Roble sponsor is even greater than that re
quired of the average freshman in the dormi
tory, considering that sponsors' rooms are
supposed to be in the nature of "hangouts"
which necessitate more elaborate fixtures than
the other women's rooms. In some cases,
sponsors from the Row keep up their house
dues in addition to room, board, and Roble
Club dues required of all sponsors. Conse
quently, women sponsors under the present
system donate gratis both time and money to
assist freshmen in acclimating themselves.
Free room rent for a service as valuable as
that done by Roble advisers obviously is not
asking too much, nor is il needlessly straying
from the Stanford theory of service for serv
ice's sake. II the Administration itself is not
in a position to furnish Ibis compensation, it
should come from another source, possibly
from the Roble Club coffers.
