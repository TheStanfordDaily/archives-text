# Winning Rightful Recognition

Wilh 2")0,(H)0 students in the nation to be
aided bv NYA this academic vear, nearlv 450

Farm students will be anions those whose
scholastic careers are being furthered by gov
ernment aid.
When President Roosevelt set aside part of
the four billion dollar work-relief fund for
various educational projects, he allotted part
to a new national administrative body now
known as the National Youth Administration.
Headed by Aubrey \V. Williams, NYA takes
over all of SERA's work in schools and uni
versities and will direct it as a separate organi
zation. Undergraduates will receive about the
same pay as they did last year, and will work
along similar lines at research, clerical, and
recreational jobs.
Graduates, however, are now especially
provided for in a separate fund. Under SERA
there was but one fund and that mainly for
undergraduates. Graduates are now given a
higher rate of pay and somewhat more spe
cialized jobs.
In Ibis way the college student receives
rightful recognition from the government of
his attempt to win financial independence.
