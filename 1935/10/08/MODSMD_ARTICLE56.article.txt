Veteran readers of Our Hasher may remember the
engrossing tale spun last year about a Convalescent
Home jolly-up in which the lovely Desdemona tackled
the gloomy Moor for a 10-yard loss.
The story continues from there. Summer came and
went, and the lovely Desdemona transferred her col
lection of dance programs, portraits, ribbons, trophies,
and bric-a-brac from Roble to the new-and-used Pi
Phi house.
Summer came and went, and a transfer came to the
Delt house from Northwestern, and wished to see the
bright lights of the city by the Golden Gate. Solicitous
brothers took him over and introduced him to the
bright lights of the Pi Phi house.
They, in turn, introduced Desdemona, who is now
on sabbatical leave from the gloomy Moor because of
the jolly-up incident.
* * + *
Summer came and went, and a date was arrived
at and the high contracting parties set out for the city.
The Delt transfer asked Desdemona if she knew how
to get to the St. Francis.
"Of course," said the lovely one. "I've been there
lots of times."
Apparently the lovely Desdemona had not been as
observant as the Girl Scout book recommends, since
11 o'clock came and went, and found the high con
tracting parties lost in the wilds of the city, completely
overlooking Union Square in San Francisco.
» * * *
Well, they finally got intramural room, and danced
a few dances, and then set out for home. The Delt
transfer asked Desdemona if she knew how to get
back to Stanford.
"Of course," said the lovely one. "I've been there
lots of times. You just follow the Bayshore till you
get to Palo Alto."
The result was that, lost in thought, the high con
tracting parties just followed the Bayshore till they
ended up in San Jose, arriving at Stanford a long
time after many of the bright lights of the Pi Phi
house had been cither extinguished or turned down
for the night.

The irate sophomore, who berated the Daily try
outee's story about the "overwhelming" mudfight in
yesterday's paper, was discovered recently breaking
all rules of civilization and Christian morality by smok
ing on the English corner. It was a particularly flagrant
violation. The Daily's associate editor in charge of
preserving the axe yell had just finished arguing with
the man for 15 minutes in regard to self-indulgence
and yielding to temptation.

preserving the axe yell had just finished arguing with
the man for 15 minutes in regard to self-indulgence
and yielding to temptation.
Veteran readers of Our Hasher may remember the
engrossing tale spun last year about a Convalescent
Home jolly-up in which the lovely Desdemona tackled
the gloomy Moor for a 10-yard loss.
The story continues from there. Summer came and
went, and the lovely Desdemona transferred her col
lection of dance programs, portraits, ribbons, trophies,
and bric-a-brac from Roble to the new-and-used Pi
Phi house.
Summer came and went, and a transfer came to the
Delt house from Northwestern, and wished to see the
bright lights of the city by the Golden Gate. Solicitous
brothers took him over and introduced him to the
bright lights of the Pi Phi house.
They, in turn, introduced Desdemona, who is now
on sabbatical leave from the gloomy Moor because of
the jolly-up incident.

Summer came and went, and a date was arrived
at and the high contracting parties set out for the city.
The Delt transfer asked Desdemona if she knew how
to get to the St. Francis.
"Of course," said the lovely one. "I've been there
lots of times."
Apparently the lovely Desdemona had not been as
observant as the Girl Scout book recommends, since
11 o'clock came and went, and found the high con
tracting parties lost in the wilds of the city, completely
overlooking Union Square in San Francisco.

Well, they finally got intramural room, and danced
a few dances, and then set out for home. The Delt
transfer asked Desdemona if she knew how to get
back to Stanford.
"Of course," said the lovely one. "I've been there
lots of times. You just follow the Bayshore till you
get to Palo Alto."
The result was that, lost in thought, the high con
tracting parties just followed the Bayshore till they
ended up in San Jose, arriving at Stanford a long
time after many of the bright lights of the Pi Phi
house had been cither extinguished or turned down
for the night.

The irate sophomore, who berated the Daily try
outee's story about the "overwhelming" mudfight in
yesterday's paper, was discovered recently breaking
all rules of civilization and Christian morality by smok
ing on the English corner. It was a particularly flagrant
violation. The Daily's associate editor in charge of
preserving the axe yell had just finished arguing with
the man for 15 minutes in regard to self-indulgence
and yielding to temptation.
