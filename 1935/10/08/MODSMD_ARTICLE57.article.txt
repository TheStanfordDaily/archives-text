# Huey: His University
## HUEY LONG AND FREEDOM OF THE PRESS 
### 
Columns of newsprint were devoted to Huey Long's
"fight" against the freedom of the Louisiana State
University student paper. His part in the matter was
always obscure. It is doubtful if he ever took an active
part in the affair.
The senator was too busy with a special session of
the Louisiana legislature and a fight on the floor of
the United States Senate against Postmaster-General
James A. Farley. Minor disturbances such as libel
suits, election investigations, and the like occupied his
' spare time. A split with the New Orleans branch of
the state Democratic party also had to be attended to.
So it is obvious Long could not have been greatly
I involved in an unimportant school squabble.

The story of "censorship" and the valiant defenders
of a free press has been often told—always differently.
Here are the main facts, some of which are open to
dispute:
In the "Voice of the People" column of the L.S.U.
Reveille, a letter to the editor from a student was
printed. The student criticized a burlesque election
Senator Long had arranged on the campus as a joke.
Before the paper was distributed, a proof of the edi-
I torial page was shown to Senator Long. He was en
i raged that a student in HIS university should attack
him. However, as near as can be proved, the senator
took no further action after expressing his indigna
tion to a student in the school of journalism who had
shown him the proof. President Smith requested that
the Reveille be published without the critical letter.
This was done.
President Smith then suggested to the editorial staff
that in case of doubt over material that might prove
offensive, the editor should consult with the director
of the school of journalism and the dean of admin
istration. Three days later he insisted on this pro
cedure. It was claimed that he did this on Senator
Long's orders. The Reveille staff interpreted this move
as "censorship" and declined to accept it, the editors
resigned in a body. Immediately a hue and cry arose
from newspapers all over the country.

From a minor squabble a major controversy devel
oped—the freedom of the press was at stake!
Attack and counter-attack made themselves heard.
| Affidavits were sworn out, editorials shouted, and the
fight was on. Students in the school of journalism pe
titioned the president to reinstate the staff. Dr. Smith
on discovering the petition had been givcti to the press
before it was handed to him suspended the signers of
the petition. During the following week the petition
ers who apologized for their "discourtesy" were re
instated; those who refused to make peace were ex
j pelled.
One of the staff members who had resigned accepted
the editorship of the Reveille, and life at L.S.U. con
tinued as before. No more was heard of censorship.
The one peculiarity of the entire case was the in
difference of the student body. No opinions for or
' against were to be heard outside of the school of jour
j nalism. The great amount of publicity aroused some
attention but little interest. This was most gratifying
; to Senator Long.
