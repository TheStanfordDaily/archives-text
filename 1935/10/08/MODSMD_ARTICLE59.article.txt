## THE 						ALARMISTS MEAN THIS 
### 
What do they mean . . . these pro
lific alarmists . . . who continually
rise up to shout that the universities
are exposing their students to radical
if not communistic teachings . . .
and are destroying rather than try
ing to strengthen loyalty to Amer
ica's system of government.
* * *
Warnings of such activities within
j the colleges are pooh-poohed by ob
durate conservatives who can't be
moved to believe that radical activi-
I ties exist unless they see a bushy
| bearded speaker stand up and make
I a speech advocating the overthrow
of the government and wind up by
! leading in the singing of the Inter
nationale. More reasonable persons
have at least a little respect for what
the alarmists are alarmed about.
* * *
Fortunately Stanford has escaped
{ the undesirable publicity such as the
University of California annually
{ suffers when some socialistic or pro
gressive group attempts to push its
j activities into the open. But to say
j that Stanford is escaping completely
j the subtle, masked, and subversive
j influences of those persons seeking
to reform the present social order by
extreme left-wing methods is ad
! mitting that one can't see the fly that
flutters in the soup bowl.
* * *
No better example of this has been
demonstrated than to those two or
i three hundred students who were
| required last week to begin study
ing a treatise on American govern
ment by Charles A. Beard. That gen
tleman, though a scholar and author
of recognized brilliancy, has gained
a reputation of being liberal to the
point of radicalism. By his open sup
port of the notorious Rand School of
Social Science, an institution de
scribed in the famous Lusk report
investigating seditious activities as
a training school for labor agitators,
Professor Beard has earned a prom
inent place in the newly published
; "Who's Who in Radicalism."
* * #
The students studying Professor
Beard's book have already found
that he devotes an entire chapter to
a very convincing, and yet subtk
criticism of the Constitution. He has
little to say in defense of it. The
reader, supposed to be studying the
Constitution from all aspects, geti
j just one view.
* * *
Stanford professors do live up tc
the ideal of presenting all sides t(J

| any question. It's certain required
j textbooks that constitute the fly in j
j an otherwise pure soup.
