# NO BILLIARDS ON SUNDAY
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Traditions set down by Mrs. Stan
ford, if not by others, really deserve
some respect in return for the few
favors she did this university. But
yesterday some Branner guys were
busy at a game of billiards in their
lobby, which, as all Encina pool and
billiard enthusiasts know, is strictly
not done on Sunday.
I am not the dryball type that
turns up his nose in disgust when
ever he passes near a table; in fact
I play both games much more than

my time permits, but I do be
lieve we should make an effort to
conform, especially to rules as
clearly outlined as this one.
P. M. K.
It's about time that traditions,
which are dying out fast enough,
were recalled.—Ed.

Women are more prone to over
rate themselves than men. a survey

department has revealed.
