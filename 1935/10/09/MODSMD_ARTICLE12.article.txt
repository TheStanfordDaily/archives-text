### 
"Men's and Women's Councils and
Their Relation to Ex Committee,"
was the subject of a discussion held
yesterday afternoon by the Student
Leadership round table, an informal
organization which surveys problems
of student government.
In answer to a challenge to the
authority of Men's Council to en
force state traffic regulations on
campus thoroughfares hurled re
cently by a traffic violator when
arraigned before the body, mem
bers of the round table decided
that President Ray Lyman Wil
bur as executive of the private
estate upon which the University
is located, could delegate the pow
er of traffic regulation to the
councils. It was further shown
that Council, acting within its jur
isdiction, has mainly adopted the
state automobile laws for appli
cation to campus roads.
Another topic of discussion was
the manner in which the problem of
drinking on the campus is handled
by Men's and Women's Councils.
One subject of discussion was that a
uniform procedure be adopted by
both bodies for dealing with cases
arising from violation of the regula
tion which prohibits the possession,
use, or transportation of intoxicating
drinks upon the campus.
The next topic which will be
discussed by the round table will
be, "B.A.C. and the Union Board
and Their Relations to Ex Com
mittee." October 22 is the date set
tentatively for the meeting, which
will probably be held in the Ex
Committee room.

sented at the round table by Peggy
Schaeffer, Barbara Kimball and
