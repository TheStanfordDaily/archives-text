# Notables Join With Synthetic Simps In Approving Petition
## 
### 
If at first you don't succeedâ€”
Stanford may yet face St.
Mary's in mortal combat on the
gridiron, if perseverance has
anything to do with it. Despite
repeated assurances that such
a game is out of the question,
sponsors of petitions in behalf
of the battle are not discour
aged.
Seen on the English corner
yesterday morning was one of
these petitions signed by such
an impressive array of names
that it could not help but in
fluence the authorities. The
signatures included: Haile Se
lassie, Joe Twirp, Rose Bush,
Jezebel Jerusalem, and the
Forgotten Man.
The date for the fray was
set for October 19, 1934.
