# Killer Rats Invade Orange Free State
## 
### 
LONDON, Oct. 3 (/P).â€”Transkei
rats, black creatures three times the
size of an ordinary rodent and with
poisoned fangs, are moving across
the Orange Free State, leaving
death and destruction in their wake.
According to a report from East
London they are attacking stock,
devouring crops, and spreading dis
ease. As they invade new districts
they are becoming more voracious
and brazen. Rat holes are dug in
many fields and the health officer
of East London says it will require
a half ton of cyanide to exterminate
the invaders.
