## Approved Round Table Conferences; Vetoes Larger Size 
### Annalee Whitmore 
Thirteen measures were disposed
of last night as a jovial Ex Commit
tee finished their second fall meet
j ing in record time.
First measure was the Round
j Table Conference, which met of
ficially for the first time yester
day afternoon. The meetings,
agreed members, should definitely
be continued because they ac-
I quaint students with the campus
and its problems. A move for en
larging membership was vetoed
because it was thought to curtail
discussion.
Granting of dates resulted in ap
! proval of October 16 for a Class of
j '37 jolly-up, November 21 for a Big
Game jolly-up from 4 to 6 o'clock,
| October 12 for an all-A.S.S.U. dance,
and all house dates. The post-Gaie-
I ties dance was definitely scheduled
! in spite of new member Bill Stark's
observation that "the only time we
ever made a profit on a Gaieties
dance was when Sally Rand was
there."
The Cardinals' request for a
closed date on November 2, after
the Santa Clara game, was tabled
for further consideration; and the
Soph Cotillion, breaking precedent,
was postponed until the beginning
of winter quarter.
Election returns were approved
without question. Paul Wahlen and
Helen Zwick were okayed as Elec
; tion Board members in place of Ed
Buttcrworth and Peg Woodard.

; added to the list of Rally Commit
members, and a by-law added pro
-1 vided that the A.S.S.U. president
I and the Cardinal head appoint a
member of the Cardinals each year
for the position of High School En
teitainment head.
Plans for a theater dedication
ceremony were delayed until a
definite date can be set for ground
breaking. Committee members
Phil Brown and Annalec Whit
more were asked to submit sub
committees for approval at the
next meeting.
Ex Committee reluctantly agreed
| to appear en masse, wearing "clean
j shirts and sour smiles," for today's
all-University assembly. "It's not
modesty, but there's no point. Why
i should anyone want to look at us?"
queried Frank Fullenwider.
The perennial Daily 15-ccnt
problem seems satisfactorily set
tled. A Gros-originated, Brooke
outlined, and Jones-approved plan
whereby the 15 cents per student
he given to the Daily in a separate
fund, and its expenditure super
vised by the editor, was unani
mously approved. At the end of
this quarter, Bob Jones will sub
mit a record of expenditures and
consequent editorial improve
ments made from the sum. which
totals approximately $500.
Regarding the yearly frosh-sopl
mud fight — "Unhealthy practice,

"Worthwhile tradition," finally de
cided Ex Committee.
The International Committee
which existed only nominally las
year, was okayed. "Last year the
