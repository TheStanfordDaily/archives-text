(Editor's N,ote: This is (he first
of a scries of articles dealing with
the various historical sites and
points of interest on the Stanford
campus.)
The Memorial Church, begun in
1899, following a tour of Europe by
Mrs. Stanford to select designs for
the structure, was completed and
formally dedicated in memory of
Senator Stanford in 11)03. Destroyed
three years later by earthquake, it
was rebuilt in 1913.
Architecture Byzantine
Perhaps the most interesting fea
ture of the Church, whose architec
ture is predominantly Byzantine, is
the wide use of brilliant mosaic
work. The mosaics, selected person
ally by Mrs. Stanford, were orig
inally made in Venice, Italy, by
Salviati, and sent to Stanford in sec
tions, where they were put in place
by Italian artisans. TTie mosaics
were ruined by the 1906 earthquake,
but were restored by the artisans
who had done the original work.
The great outdoor portrayal of the
Sermon on the Mount is one of the
most notable of the mosaics, but the
finest is that if the Lord's Supper,
the only mosaic copy ever made of

the original in the Sistine Chapel of
the The other mosaics in
side the building present a series of
Old Testament stories. The windows
in the lower part of the church por
tray scenes from the life of Christ;
the upper ones picture heroes and
heroines of the Bible.
Organ Undamaged
The organ, built just before the
earthquake, was unhurt by the tre
mor. The building itself, however,
crashed to the ground; mosaics and
statuary in the chancel were dam
aged beyond repair, and seven years
were spent in rebuilding the struc
ture from the foundations up. A
steel enforced wall now encases the
entire building with the mosaics
placed on top of this base.
Services are held in the church
daily, and on Sundays clergymen of
all denominations preach. Under the
careful guidance of Dr. D. Charles
Gardner, who has been pastor of the
chapel since its beginning, Stanford
receives that which cannot be ob
tained from "books and science," a.'
Mrs. Stanford once said, and the
chapel continues to fulfill the wish
of its dedicator that "the church
should be the heart and center of
this university."
