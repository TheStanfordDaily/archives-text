Addressing an audience dominat
ed by professors and townspeople,
Professor B. Q. Morgan introduced
a series of four lectures on Richard
Wagner's "Niebelungen Ring" at the
Tuesday evening lecture last night.
Professor Morgan sketched the
life of Richard Wagner and then
proceeded to indicate the import
ance of Wagner's contributions to
the operatic world. "Just as Beet
hoven brought the symphony to a
point which has never since been
surpassed," he said, "so Wagner
completely exhausted the possibil
ities of the opera."
In narrating the story of the four
operas which make up Wagner's
Ring. Professor Morgan compared
the story of Wagner's operas to the
Germanic legends from which he
drew his material.
Of Wagner's contributions to the
opera, Professor Morgan consid
ered the light motif, one of the
most significant. In the Ring there
are 90 of these themes which Wag
ner used to identify various char
acters and situations, Professor
Morgan stated. He sang the themes
which recur most often in the Ring.
Next Tuesday evening Professor
Kurt F. Reinhardt of the German
department will give the second ad
dress of the series on "The Staging
of Richard Wagner's Ring." The last
two lectures on October 22 and 29

Rheingold" and "Die Walkure" and
