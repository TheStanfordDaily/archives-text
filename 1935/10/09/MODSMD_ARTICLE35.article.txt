# CHOOSING WOMEN SPONSORS
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Why should the payment of the
women sponsors change the "basis
for selection" of those girls? It
seems to me that rather than cause
a change, it would aid in accom
plishing the original purpose in se
lecting sponsors—to choose worthy
and capable women.
Roble sponsoring, apart from be
ing a time-consuming and exacting
job, is an expensive one. Frequent
spreads and parties are the order of
the day for the new frosh women in
order that they may become ac
quainted, and the sponsors are the
hostesses . . . The mere fact that
they must be the "examples to the
freshmen" sets up a higher standard
of clothing requirements which
other campus women may set aside
ii necessary. Yet in spite of added
expense, girls who accept the office
must forego the possibility of earning
a part of their expenses in the house
or dormitory. Indeed, the position of
sponsor cannot honor the girl who
must adhere to a strict budget. . . .
Selection of women sponsors ac
cording to the present system defi
nitely limits the field to a considera
tion of those girls who can afford to
accept the post. How can this selec
tive factor insure that the most
worthy and capable girls are chosen
to guide freshmen women?

The Editor, Sir:
I still think that St. Mary's-Stan
ford game is a good idea.
But not for this year, since it is
definitely out for the very valid rea
sons suggested by the B.A.C. last
week.
Therefore, I am launching a cam
paign to "Schedule the Gaels in '36."
It will mean a natural football classic
between the nation's outstanding ex
ponents of the Rockne and Warner
coaching systems.
It will be a second big game for
students and will attract a crowd
second only to that contest. The
gate will exceed $200,000.
Why not?

freshmen" sets up a higher standard
of clothing requirements which
other campus women may set aside
ii necessary. Yet in spite of added
expense, girls who accept the office
must forego the possibility of earning
a part of their expenses in the house
or dormitory. Indeed, the position of
sponsor cannot honor the girl who
must adhere to a strict budget. . . .
Selection of women sponsors ac

tion of those girls who can afford to
accept the post. How can this selec
tive factor insure that the most
worthy and capable girls are chosen
to guide freshmen women?

The Editor, Sir:
I still think that St. Mary's-Stan
ford game is a good idea.
But not for this year, since it is
definitely out for the very valid rea
sons suggested by the B.A.C. last
week.
Therefore, I am launching a cam
paign to "Schedule the Gaels in '36."
It will mean a natural football classic
between the nation's outstanding ex
ponents of the Rockne and Warner
coaching systems.
It will be a second big game for
students and will attract a crowd
second only to that contest. The
gate will exceed $200,000.
Why not?

When football games are to be
measured solely by gate receipts,
Stanford might as well quit the
