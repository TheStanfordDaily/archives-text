In order to sound out student
opinion on current -questions. The
Daily will print from time to time
I comments on timely subjects by
prominent members of the student
body. The question before today's
forum is:
"Should women sponsors re
ceive their room rent free in re
turn for the time and services they
: donate to the University?"
Jacqueline Flanders, A.S.S.U.
; vice-president: "I think women
| sponsors should receive free room
rent, because it is an imposition. It
requires a great deal of time and
I there should be some recompense for
them besides the opportunity to
make contacts."
Peg Shaeffer, chairman of Wom
en's Council: "I do not think that
\ they should receive free room. There
should be some remuneration but
I not necessarily that."
