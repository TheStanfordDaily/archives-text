WHISPER: Beatrice Lillie was re
fused admission to the Radio City
Rainbow Room because her escort
was in something less than full
dress! These ritzy Rockefellers!
FLICKERING FRAMES: Wallace
Beery, who starts as m.c. for Shell
Chateau next Saturday, is to play
Will Rogers' part in "Ah, Wilder
ness" for MGM. . . . Wooden Fred
eric March will play Romeo to Nor
ma Shearer's Juliet in MGM's forth
coming film. . . . The pay-as-you
exit idea is being revived in Mid-
West theaters.
THIS 'N' THAT: The British
Broadcasting Corporation forbids
the use of the word "hot" applied
to music on their stations. . . . Tom
my Dorsey's new orchestra is really
Joe Haymes' old one, and Haymes
will do all the arranging. . . . Cole
Porter's new show, "Jubilee," is a
hit.
NOT SO CRAZY: When people
ask us, "Why the heck do you wpnt
to waste your time puttering around

with the newspaper racket?" we
merely quote last year's balance
sheet of the New York Daily News:
net profit, $4,500,000. And one mil
lion of that was split among the top
seven executives as bonuses in addi
tion to their regular salaries. The
News, incidentally, has the largest
circulation of any newspaper in
America: 1,500,000 daily, 2,500,000
Sunday.
AND THEN THERE WAS the
dumb dame that thought all Ethiop
ians were immoral, since their em
peror's name was Haile Salacious.
