# 500 Fans Watch Indians Prepare For Coming Ucla Game
## Cardinal Regulars Ready To Meet Highly Touted U.C.L.A. Backfield 
### Warren Breed 
It would be too bad if the Ucla
Bruins, who are being built up as a
powerful offensive team, would beat
Stanford Saturday.
The Cardinal winning streak (for
getting New Year's games) would be
shattered.
Rose Bowl chances would go glim
mering.
A possible defeat by California's
Bears would loom up and hover like
a cloud over the campus.
But chances for defeat at the
hands of the Bruins look quite small.
Last night, as some 500 students
came out for the first students' day,
the varsity lined up just as it was
supposed to line up all season.
Bobby Grayson was in there.
Bobby Hamilton was in there.
Yes. and Bobby Reynolds, who was
felt for yesterday on account of a
sore hip. And that means that it
will be virtually the same team
that smothered U.C.L.A. 27-0
down South last year.
Even Alex Trompas and Woody
Adams, the two other not-too
healthy ones, were out in suits.
No Scrimmage for Varsity
Tiny did not have his varsity
scrimmageâ€”better not to now just
as they are all well and ready to go.
They ran through an exhaustive
.signal drill while second and third
teams put on a scrimmage for the
crowd.
Grayson, Alustiza, Hamilton, and
Paulman will get first call against
the Westwood boys, but Jimifty Cof
fis and Joe Vigna were following the
varsity around, and taking their
turns, as were Swede Carlson, Porky
Cuneo, and Carl Schott, tackle,
guard, and end, respectively, who
have earned first-lin,e reserve jobs
by nice work in competition.
Uclans Speedy
Meanwhile there's something go
ing on down in Los Angeles that
sounds like a dangerous backfield.
Heading the quartet is Chuck
Cheshire, half, who used to run
the 100 in even time, and who
they say is no sluggard at packing
the ball. The Cardinal defense,
which hasn't been shoved around
any yet, will probably have to
give hiin more than cursory at
tention.
Then there is one Fred Funk, a
215-pounder of the bone-pulveriz
ing, smashing variety. The other two
regulars are supposed to be so good
thcii Ted Key, one of the all-Coast
variety last year, is spending a good
deal of time on Coach Bill Spaul
ding's bench.
