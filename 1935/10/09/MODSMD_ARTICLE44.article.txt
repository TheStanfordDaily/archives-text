# Water Poloists Polish Offense
## 
### 
Varsity water poloists have been
working hard and desperately try
ing to whip a forward line into a
scoring combination before Friday
evening when they tangle with a
strong Athens Club team here.
Injuries and colds have put four
of the six fastest forwards on the
sidelines for the better part of a
week, which isn't a bit encouraging
to Coach Nort Thornton. The
Stanford defense, however, rather
brightens up the picture. It is noth
ing short of brilliant and should
rank with the best in the country
this season.
The guard positions are ably
handled by Bill Woodard, Wally
Wiget, and "Suds" Sutherland. Ef
fectively backing up this trio is Bob
HaslacHer, sensational all-confer
ence goalie.
