HUSKY HUNT KNOWS
ABOUT U.C.L.A.
Scout Husky Hunt knows as much
about U.C.L.A.'s football team this
year as anyone on the Farm. That's
because Husky was at Portland last
Saturday to watch the Uclans give
Oregon State a handy beating.
But scouts are scouts and Mr.
Hunt, being a faithful follower of
his profession, wasn't prone to do
any too much talking about what
he saw up north when this Side
liner approached him yesterday.
There were a lot of things Husky
didn't say but at the same time he
came to the rescile with some inter
esting facts about Coach Bill Spaul
ding's charges. The sum total of his
remarks left his listener believing
that Husky felt this way about the
Bruins. Just an impression, how
ever.
First of all, that U.C.L.A. has
n't an especially outstanding foot
ball club. Secondly, tliat Stanford
should win quite handily from the
Bruins, if the Indians aren't hav
ing a decidedly "off day."
U.C.L.A. has no outstanding punt
er and they aren't extraordinarily
fast. The last point might have been
due to the fact that they played on
a dirt field at Portland and one who
is trained to judge speed on grass
turf might be fooled.
For this early time in the season
they might have achieved a good
degree of smoothness and they have
a good passing attack, centered
around number one man, Chuck
Cheshire.
TIIE PERFECT PLAY—
A RARITY
They executed a perfect play at
Portland last Saturday, something
that isn't often seen. Cheshire, on a
cutback, went through the line out
side of tackle, reversed his field, and
with every man doing his work per
fectly, went 73 yards for a touch
down, the first score for the Bruins.
Every play is designed to result in a
touchdown if everything goes per
fectly. This one did.
Next to Cheshire, who plays left
half, their best man is Quarter
back Bill Murphy, who does about

one-third of the passing. That's
to give Cheshire, who is both pass
thrower and catcher, a chance to
try the receiving end. ,
Right Halfback Fred Funk does
most of the punting, isn't as fast as
the other backfield men, but is
chiefly a blocking half. He's their
best blocker.
They're still trying to find a good
fullback to fit with these three backs.
Bill Spaulding tried several at that
job against Oregon State; the best so
far is Remy Olmstead. Bill Mc-
Chesney at left end is the outstand
ing lineman. He's a good pass
catcher and gets clown well under
the punts. Sherman Chavoor at cen
ter is the most powerful line player.
They play a seven-man line, dia
mond defense, and have an unusual
method of lining up.
They walk from the huddle into
three lines, perpendicular to the line
of scrimmage, one at each end and
one at center. Then the shift is made
into regular offensive formation.

about U.C.L.A.'s football team this
year as anyone on the Farm. That's
because Husky was at Portland last
Saturday to watch the Uclans give
Oregon State a handy beating.
But scouts are scouts and Mr.
Hunt, being a faithful follower of
his profession, wasn't prone to do
any too much talking about what
he saw up north when this Side
liner approached him yesterday.
There were a lot of things Husky
didn't say but at the same time he
came to the rescile with some inter
esting facts about Coach Bill Spaul
ding's charges. The sum total of his
remarks left his listener believing
that Husky felt this way about the
Bruins. Just an impression, how
ever.
First of all, that U.C.L.A. has
n't an especially outstanding foot
ball club. Secondly, tliat Stanford
should win quite handily from the
Bruins, if the Indians aren't hav
ing a decidedly "off day."
U.C.L.A. has no outstanding punt
er and they aren't extraordinarily
fast. The last point might have been
due to the fact that they played on
a dirt field at Portland and one who
is trained to judge speed on grass
turf might be fooled.
For this early time in the season
they might have achieved a good
degree of smoothness and they have
a good passing attack, centered
around number one man, Chuck
Cheshire.
TIIE PERFECT PLAY—
A RARITY
They executed a perfect play at
Portland last Saturday, something
that isn't often seen. Cheshire, on a
cutback, went through the line out
side of tackle, reversed his field, and
with every man doing his work per
fectly, went 73 yards for a touch
down, the first score for the Bruins.
Every play is designed to result in a
touchdown if everything goes per
fectly. This one did.
Next to Cheshire, who plays left
half, their best man is Quarter
back Bill Murphy, who does about

one-third of the passing. That's
to give Cheshire, who is both pass
thrower and catcher, a chance to
try the receiving end. ,
Right Halfback Fred Funk does
most of the punting, isn't as fast as
the other backfield men, but is
chiefly a blocking half. He's their
best blocker.
They're still trying to find a good
fullback to fit with these three backs.
Bill Spaulding tried several at that
job against Oregon State; the best so
far is Remy Olmstead. Bill Mc-
Chesney at left end is the outstand
ing lineman. He's a good pass
catcher and gets clown well under
the punts. Sherman Chavoor at cen
ter is the most powerful line player.
They play a seven-man line, dia
mond defense, and have an unusual
method of lining up.
They walk from the huddle into
three lines, perpendicular to the line
of scrimmage, one at each end and
one at center. Then the shift is made
into regular offensive formation.
