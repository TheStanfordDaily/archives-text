in return for it. With theater ground
breaking set tentatively for the first
part of November, Roth will outline
the timely topic of theater plans, and
describe the structure as it will ap

A discussion of student activities
in general will feature A.S.S.U.
President Wally Brooke. Brooke
will introduce Jimmy Triolo, to pre

members of Ex Committee, heads of
Men's and Women's Councils, yell

The assembly has been planned
especially for new students, accord
ing to Brooke, as it is an opportunity
for them to become acquainted with
their governing bodies and how they
work. All old students are also
urged to attend, as rules and officers
change from year to year.
