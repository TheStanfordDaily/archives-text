# Present Track Hopes Center On 1935 Aces
## Dellinger, Weiershauser Lead Quarter-milers

Coach Dink Templeton's varsity
track squad will be as little changed
from last spring's aggregation as the
football team in from last year's,
present prospects indicate. It may
seem early to talk about track, but,
judging from the hard work and en
thusiasm present at the daily sta
dium workouts, the season might be
near at hand.
Only the following prominent j
point winners have graduated: j
Captain A1 Blackmail, ace quar- j
ter-miler and relay man; javelin j
men Jfohn Mottram, Tom Sales,
and Hill Beaty; and two-miler
Dave- Devlin.
The annual turnover seems to fill
in these holes fairly well. The com
ing battle for number one quarter
miler between Truck Dellinger and
Ray and Weiershauser, Modesto J.C.
transfer, .should aid both boys in
equaling Blackmail's achievements.
In the javelin, Jack Kellogg, a Pasa
dtna J.C. transfer, is showing prom
ise.
Lanky Sophomore Edson Bur
rows is expected to take over
where little Dave Devlin left off, !
as the former's two-mile ability
was nearly equal to Dave's last 1
year.

Idaho prescribed intensive study to
freshmen a.s the best cure for home
