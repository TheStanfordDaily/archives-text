### 
In 1917, the United States hurled itself into
a war it had once thought it would never enter
at any cost. More than 11000 Stanford men
— graduates, students, and alumni — served
their country at that time, 2800 of them in
actual military, naval, or marine service.
Over 100 of them never returned to normal
civilian life 20 died in action; about 50, in
service; about 11") were seriously wounded.
At present, the most serious threat to world
peace since 1911 has developed as the League
invokes its sanctions in the Italo-Ethiopian
affair. Although America is not directly in
volved as yet, the threat is not one to be tossed
aside, as Professor Stuart pointed out yes
terday. Nor is it one upon which intelligent
men can all'ord to be uninformed.
America, Mr. Washington and Mr. Hearst
to the contrary notwithstanding, is not and
never has been isolated from Europe or her
troubles. This is a matter of fact and history,
not opinion. Since 1088, there have been eight
(mostly Franco-British) was that were in a
sense world wars. In spite of ourselves and
our traditional isolationist policy, we were in
volved in each and every one of these mars.
Unfortunately, developing economic life
has made it more diilicult than ever for us to
remain aloof from European embroglios. We
have sent alxuit 4.") billions across the Atlantic
since 11)14.
A neutral nation's dilliculty centers around
contraband. In the seventeenth century Gro
tius found it possible to classify goods as con
traband, semi-contraband, and non-contra
band. But now, when shrapnel is made from
nailfilcs, glycerine taken from lipsticks, and
tomato cans serve as hand-grenades, hard

pressed belligerents are less likely to let them
selves he hampered hv once-held interna
tional contraband distinctions.
The ray of hope in this dark picture is that
the temper of the times seems to he gradu
ally changing. Herein lies the possibility that
the Stanford man and oilier forward-thinkers
can do their bit to prevent us from becoming
involved to the point of actual warfare. The
old idea that national honor consists in blow
ing the head oil' anyone who touches an iota
of American goods or persons wherever they
may be must be modified.
Fortunately, the President appears lo be
on the side of the cool heads at present.
Under the Neutrality Bill passed by Congress
lo cover a six-month period, Roosevelt has
forbidden Americans to travel on either Ital
ian or Ethiopian ships. Furthermore, he has
warned American commercial interests that
commerce in ant/ commodity is carried on
with the belligerents at their own risk.
This is a milestone in the progress of sanity
and reasonable nationalism. But it is a for
ward step that may have to be retraced if the
sentiment of the American people cannot be
held in check. If the people become hot
headed and over-touchy about national honor,
we will again be in the thick of the light,
where not a few would like to see us.
If world war comes and we do the near
impossible and stay out, it will be because
educated people, like Stanford men, have been
far-sighted enough to exert their initiative
and influence in favor of moderation and
sanity, and not lose their heads lo the war
fever springing from propaganda and emo
tionalit v.
