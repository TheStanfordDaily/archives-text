# Not Thrilling, But Needed

For the first time lliis year an enterprising
Stanford man has brought lip Ihe subject of
traditions in "Vox Campi." Although the anti
pool - playing -on - Sunday tradition is not a
major or a necessarily stirring one, as a re
quest of one of the University founders, it is
deserving of observance.
It is gratifying, at any rale, to see a Stan
ford man willing to raise bis voice in support
of traditions, which old-timers bewail as be
ing too much trampled on of late.
Some traditions, obviously, must pass in
any developing institution. Hut there is a dis
tinction between outworn traditions that arc
doomed, and still-functional ones that are
losing ground due to indifference, laziness,
and lack of information. Possibly because of
the many newcomers and increasing women,
too many cases in the latter class have been
noted on the Farm of late. Possibly it is be
cause of no concerted drive to save them.
He that as il may, the Stanford Rough does
not smoke on Quad, boo athletic officials, or
break the Honor Code. Nor does he forget to
say "hello" 011 the campus, pick up passengers
when driving to and from Paly, or dress demo
cratically.
Traditions are usually reasonably small
things, not immensely impressive or enter
taining in themselves; but according to wiser
and older men, they are the difference between
a clutter of buildings on a campus and a
Universitv.
