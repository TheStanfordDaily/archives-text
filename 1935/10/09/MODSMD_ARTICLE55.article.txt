Iha l Skinfold ill continue lo maintain

her traditionally sane yet surprisingly unique
attitude toward her football team was made
apparent by the turnout of more than ,300
students at yesterday's "Students' Day" prac
tice.
Football teams on many campi are in real
ity not a portion of the student body—they

line heroes. Partly because of the well-estab
lished "hello" tradition, Stanford has been
able to keep her gridiron greats down near the
level of the remainder of the A.S.S.U.
As long as a plan like the "know your
team" move, which is sponsored by Couch
Tiny Thornhill and the players themselves,
can gain the support shown yesterday, Stan
ford's tradition of a unified student body is
in little danger.
