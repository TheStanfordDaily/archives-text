# Huey: His University
## WHAT THE STUDENTS THOUGHT OF LONG 
### 
L.S.U. students liked Senator Long. He was Huey
to them. Whenever he appeared on the campus he was
loyally greeted and followed about en masse. Every
word he uttered was treasured and enjoyed. At a foot
ball game, when he showed up to see "his team" win,
his arrival drew all eyes and a loud: "Yea, Huey!"
And Huey Long liked the students. He recalled
their names with amazing facility. In Louisiana, re
membering names is unusually difficult for a great
number of the people are of French descent. The
names ai~e long and peculiarly accented. Yet Huey
Long remembered them.
* * * *
The students were grateful to Long. He gave them
a real university and one they could afford to go to.
He gave them winning teams, free trips, and plenty of
boosting. He was their Huey.
Many students came from districts and families
hostile to the KingfLsh, in fact Baton Rouge, where the
school is located, is bitterly opposed to the Long re
gime. Yet it was always clear that the students were
for him.
Long never did anything intentionally that he be
lieved would hurt the good name of the university.
Inevitably its reputation suffered from being coupled
with the name of a political adventurer but this was
unavoidable.

When Senator Long died, the student body was
just gathering. Registration was soon to begin. The
news of his assassination stunned the students and
they are still bewildered. With all his faults he was
Louisiana State's benefactor. "What will come now?"
was the question everyone asked. "Can the school be
the same without him?"
Perhaps not. It will probably improve. His work
at L.S.U. is done—he laid the foundation and his
continued presence would have done more harm than
good. The university can now develop normally. If
Huey Long continued to run the university, he might
have injured its prestige irrepairably—a thing he
would never have wished to do.
