## OF COURSE WE'LL FIGHT 
### 
The world series of bat and ball is
yesterday's news. Today it's the
world series of rifle and bullet.
The umpires have called a foul on
Mussolini, and Lion Selassie is down
two strikes. It's batters up, and all
Europe is fighting for a chance at
| the plate. Even bleacher-loving
i Uncle Sam is trying out his stock
: of gloves and hickory sticks.

Would you play ball? You would
not. But to khakied grey-heads in
Berlin, London, Paris, and Washing
ton, you're already in uniform.
Would you thrill to martial music,
believe that Italians eat little girls?
Would you care if your girl friend
called you a coward and walked off
with some clown in brown? "Of
course not." But you would.

You've read "Merchants of Death."
I You've found out how smart type
writer pluggcrs in Washington's offi
cial basements cook up hair-curling
yarns. And you'd like to see them
get you in a trench with a gun and
a healthy black hate.
You favored the war strike. May
be you would have liked to march
behind a banner denouncing the
munitions makers, just to show them
you had their number.

But we venture that the men who
make a business of masquerading
the news smiled as they watched us
howling against war from print and
platform.
All they wanted to know was that
j thousands of students could think
1 one way. A mob tendency is the
only essential to war fever that they
could not create. With that in the
bag, it is mere routine for them to
change the emphasis from one mag
netic point to any other.
It may seem incredible now, but
to find a good reason to get us into
| the trenches is apple-pie simple.
I There's always a senator, a con
gressman, or a president to let slip
; a good catch-line, and good rewrite
men to pick it up. to bias the news,
to introduce with undetectable sub
tlety the germ that would ravage
our reasons, and inevitably force us
into line on Market Street or Fifth
Avenue.
And once the word-men are given
! the starting flash, Terman tests,
1 hard-won knowledge, and anti-war
fixations would cancel themselves
out of the picture. We'd use our
| heads like the ditch-digger march

ing beside us.
Fox* the dealers in war hop don't
worry about human convictions.
They use human nature, the same
old stuff that made Thermopylae and
Waterloo.
