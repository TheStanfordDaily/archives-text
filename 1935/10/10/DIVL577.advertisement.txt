Two "A C t Suits

It's in the cards. A co-ed simply can't get by these days without at least
one dress-suit.'' We've sketched a couple of quick tricks that will send
the most bewildered "freshie" merrily rolling along to sorority teas, luncheons,
and football games. Gwen Beaver, our campus representative in the College
Shop, will show you these and any others you please.

wool fabric. Pottery rust, bottle and skirt that matches the krimmer
green, black. $28. trimmed short coat. $29.75.
