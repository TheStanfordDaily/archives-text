# Bruins Purpose To Beat Indian Eleven In Game Saturday
## Uclans Depart from Old 'Hold-or-Die' Spirit As Battle Nears 
### Warren Breed 
For as far back now as any pres
ent generation Stanford student can
lemember, the U.C.L.A. Bruins have
always entered the Indian game wit)i
the hold-or-die spirit to "hold 'em
to a couple of touchdowns, boys."
But this year all that is changed.
Bill Spaulding will bring his
Bruins to Stanford Saturday with
the express purpose of beating the
Cards.
Of course the Cards have an iron
clad rebuttal for this Westwood the
ory, but the fact remains that the
two Stanford scouts, Coaches John
Bunn and Husky Hunt, who have
lamped the Bruins, are still fasci
nated by the smooth, potent drive
of the southerners.
Backfield Is Berries
And lately columns of press re
ports have been floating around to
the end that the Uclan backfield is
the berries. All of which goes to in
dicate the Bruins and their press
agents and sponsors have thrown
off the shackles and really are
spreading a clarion call of victory.
This smooth unit as seen by
Bunn and Hunt was a line aver
aging 20J{ pounds, and big, back
field, headlining Chuck Cheshire.
Cheshire' 's merit is endorsed by
each and every one who has watched
him cut back of! tackle this year and
slant out for yardage. He can pass,
too.
Impossible Set-up
The afore-mentioned will-to-win
spirit of the Bruins brings a strange
situation, for that makes two teams
that expect to win Saturday, and
anyone of sound mind knows that is
an impossibility.
For Stanford also has intentions of
winning.
Metropolitan sports writers ad
mit that Stanford is O.K. on the
defense and has a good attack,
but they are still reminding the
Indians of two weak spots: pass
defense and poor protection of the
safety man.
So last night Coach Claude E.
Thornhill worked his varsity on
those two glaring spots.
First safety men ran back kick
after kick, with appropriate block
ing in the right places. Then Bobby
Grayson, Bones Hamilton, Frank
Alustiza, and Bill Paulman got back
and worked on their pass defense.
Pass to Ends
Ernie Nevers and Johnny Camp
bell got back and tossed passes 1o
ends Monk Moscrip, Keith Top
ping, Carl Schott, and Rog Munger.
But even at that, the pass defense
still remains far from what it should
be, for the ends got behind the sec
ondary time and time again on plays
that would be disastrous to the Card
defense record in a game.
Ail season now, since September
15, a little battle has been going on
for the first string center position.
Alf Brandin has been starting the
games of late, but in the last two
practice sessions Wes Muller, who
was reported in one paper as looking
"like two guys in one suit" has been
playing with the first string, and
chances are that Bubbles will start
Saturday.
