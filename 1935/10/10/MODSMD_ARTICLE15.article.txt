# Farm Needs Funds, Says Comptroller
## Stanford No Longer Has Greatest Endowment, Largest Campus 
### 
No longer can it be said that Stan
ford has the largest campus or is the
richest university in the United
States, Almon E. Roth, comptroller,
told students at an all-University
assembly yesterday morning.
Stanford ranks sixth at present in
the matter of gross endowment and
twenty-first in per capita endow
ment, he related. It is surpassed by
Harvard, Yale, and several others in
the matter of wealth, and by a col
ored college in Tennessee in size.
Comptroller Roth stressed the
need of gifts and other contribu
tions to maintain the University's
sound financial basis. The pros
pect of lower rates of interest on
investments in the future and the
possibility of inflation makes the
present outlook none too bright.
At present, however, he said, the
increased enrollment of women
has made a 5 per cent restoration
in wage cut possible.
Explaining the duties of his of
fice, which controls the running of
an institution comprising 14 square
miles of actual campus, and which
is engaged daily in 26 different kinds
of business enterprise, the comptrol
ler named several of the technicali
ties that had to be surmounted in
order to give the school a legal
status. These include legislative en
actments, amendments, and court
decisions.
The assembly was also addressed
by Wally Brooke, A.S.S.U. president,
and Jim Triolo, member of the
B.A.C. board. Brooke introduced the
various members of the Ex Com
mittee and told the groups they rep
resented. Triolo explained the work
ings of the B.A.C.
