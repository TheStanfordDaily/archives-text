The day when Palm Drive was
only a dirt road, unevenly lined by
: eucalyptus and palm trees, is gone,
but not forgotten by those who have
I seen Stanford in its earliest day,
displays now in the library show.
Starting even earlier than the
University, the exhibit pictures the
homes of the Stanfords before
their dreams were developed into
this university. Sacramento was
, the Stanfords' home during Sen
ator Stanford's term in Congress,
and there Lcland Stanford, Jr.,
was born.
Pictures and descriptions of the
San Francisco home are included in
the display. What Stanford students
—especially frosh who must work
j off hours—now know as the Con
valescent Home was once the home
of the Stanfords.

Mrs. Stanford probably did more
to keep the University together
after her husband's death than
any other one person. To the Me
morial Church Mrs. Stanford
brought every tribute to beauty,
for, of all the buildings and insti
tutions on the campus, the Chapel
was most dear to her.
Various books which have been
written about Senator and Mrs.
Stanford are also on display! as are
copies of speeches that Mrs. Stan
ford made during her career as
founder of the University.
These include "Mrs. Leland Stan
ford: An Intimate Account," written
by Miss Bertha Berner, who was
Mrs. Stanford's secretary for 20
years, and "The Story of a Good
Woman." by David Starr Jordan,
first president of the University and
dear friend of Mrs. Stanford.
