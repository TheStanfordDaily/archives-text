In answer to the Daily's editorial
challenging the faculty to write and
edit one entire issue of the paper to
justify their frequent criticism,
members of the professorial body
seemed to be for the most part in
terested in the idea, but doubted
whether it would be practical.
Several of the faculty members
who were asked to give their opin
ions were enthusiastic about the
project. Professor Edwin Cottrell
said, "It would be a good idea. I
would be willing to devote time
to it. Perhaps then I could get
some of my notices into the paper."
Professor Ernest Hilgard thought
that it would be worth trying once.
He said, "It might work out. The
faculty is so used to saying things
to the students that they should be
able to say it in a paper as well as
anywhere else."
Professor Richard LaPierc also
thought that it could be done. But
he added that the paper would
probably be one that the students
would not care to read. "The tech
nique of the students is somewhat
amateur, hut at least they arc in
terested in what they arc doing.
The faculty would do it as a duty,"
he said.
Dean Yost thought the idea an in
teresting one and that the faculty
would be able to carry it out if they
could find the time.
Only two professors expressed
disapproval of the plan. Dr. Marg
ery Bailey said, "The faculty
couldn't possibly do it. They are
too far removed from student af
fairs. ft would not only be be
neath their dignity, but it would
also be a waste of a good issue.
It would add nothing to the paper.
There is no point to the idea."
Professor Thomas Bailey briefly
stated that the faculty would do well
to let the students run their own
paper. They are quite competent
to do so.
