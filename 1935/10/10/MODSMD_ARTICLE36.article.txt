# Hauptmann Verdict Upheld by Second New Jersey Court
## 
### 
TRENTON, N.J., Oct. 9 (A 3 ). —
Bruno Richard Hauptmann's path
to the electric chair was cleared to
day by New Jersey's highest court,
which upheld his conviction for the
murder of the Lindbergh baby.
Unanimously, the 13 members of
the Court of Errors and Appeals
upheld the Bronx carpenter's con
viction last winter by a Hunterdon
county jury.
Agree on Verdict
"Our conclusion is that the verdict
is not only net contrary to the weight
of the evidence, but one to which
the evidence inescapably led," the
opinion read.
"From three different and in the
main, unrelated sources, the proofs
point unerringly to guilt, viz.:
Possession and use of the ran
som money.
The handwriting of the ransom
note.
The wood used in the construc
tion of the ladder."
Overriding objections of defense
counsel, the court decided that the
trial had been fair and that Haupt
mann's constitutional rights had not
been violated.
The court found that Hauptmann's
explanation of how he came into
possession of the Lindbergh ransom
money was "incredible, and we find
hot the slightest evidence to cor
roborate it."
