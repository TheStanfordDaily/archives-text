### 
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 9 (/P). â€”
Three men were questioned today in
the supposed extortion plot against
blonde Mae West of the movies, but
they apparently had no connection
with the case and were released al
most immediately, investigatox's said.
Insisting on his innocence, George
Janios, 38, studio cafe worker, was
still held. J. Clark Sellers, police
handwriting expert, said, however,
Janios obviously did not write the
rambling letters, in which Miss
West was threatened with death or
marring of her features by acid un
less she paid $1,000.
