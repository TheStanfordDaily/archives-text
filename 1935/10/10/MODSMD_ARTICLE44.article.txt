NEW YORK, Oct. 9 (/P). â€”Sir Wil
liam Craigie, who, since 1927 has
been compiling a dictionary of
American English, said today Amer
icanisms have made such inroads in j
England in the last 50 years that
Britons have more new American j
words than they have new English
words. He returned with Lady Crai- |
gie from his home at Oxford to re
sume his chair of English at the Uni
versity of Chicago.
"The British have combatted
many of the American words, such !
as 'lengthy'," he said, "but the Amer
ican 'O.K.' which began in 1840 in
Boston, has spread all over the Eng- !
lish speaking world."
