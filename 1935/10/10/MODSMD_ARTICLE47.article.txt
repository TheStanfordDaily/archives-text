IT'S A TRADE! On December 5,
Bins Crosby and Tommy Dorsey's
! ork replace Paul Whiteman on that
■ cheese show. . . . And on January 5,
Paul Whiteman and band replace
Bing Crosby and his soft-soaping.
PICK-UPS: KGMB, Honolulu,
plans the opening of Frisco studios.
... KNX is plugging itself as the
"single-station chain" . . . NBC's new
! Hollywood studios will be ready No
! vember 15. . . . Each studio, instead
I of being numbered or lettered, will
i be "colored"; the Green Room, the
Mauve Room, etc. . . . Paramount is
dickering for the film rights to "One
1 Man's Family."
TELEPHONEY: A. T. & T. is
j burned because the Federal Com-
J munications Commission ordered it
to make its new coaxial cable for
television available to any experi
menter who wants it. The phone
■ company wants exclusive rights on
whatever is developed, but the com
mission, sensing that the cable is
| only economical for long-distance
J use (which probably means for in
ternational purposes), is afraid that
A. T. & T. will build a trans-Atlantic
' cable and hand American television
| over to British control.
CO-OPERATION — that's what
you'll get from The Daily and Chap
pie this year, at least as far as re
views are concerned. Chappie's re
viewer, in this morning's issue, cov-
I ers the summer season, and his opin
| ions are diametrically opposite from
ours. He thought "Othello" was
I wooden, "Antigone" fine. We
i throught "Othello" was fine, "Anti
gone" wooden. You pays your mon
} ey and you takes your cherce.
CLEVER TITLE, the one for Wal
i ter O'Keefe's radio sketch tonight:
! "G-Men on a Horse."
