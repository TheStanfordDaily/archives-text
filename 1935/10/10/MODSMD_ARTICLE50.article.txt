# STAYING OUT OF WAR
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
I want to commend . . . the Daily
on the truly admirable war editor- \
ial of Wednesday morning. It is such
a spirit as you expressed which must
oe fostered in order to keep this
country out of the European mess, j
I feel sure that the majority of
sentiment in our country today is in
favor of remaining free of the Euro
pean struggle. However, if this '
spirit is to be preserved when the j
pressure of propaganda and the voice J
of the old "Save America's Honor" !
club breaks upon us, we must do all
we can to foster it now.
To my mind the present govern
ment neutrality program is a decided
step in the direction. Nevertheless,
it requires many additions and much
strengthening if it is in any way to
keep us free of war. There must be
drastic restrictions on commercial
and financial transactions between
this country and Europe. The losses
which our country may suffer in
temporarily confining most of her
activities to North and South Amer
ica and the Orient will certainly be
much less to which we would be
subject were we again to become in-
I volved in a European conflict.
As you have suggested, a strong
student opinion throughout the
country in universities such as Stan
ford can go a long way in influencing
adequate legislation. Better still, let
us work for an organized student
opinion that we will express its
views in concerted voice.
