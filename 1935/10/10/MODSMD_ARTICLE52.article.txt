ANGFXL FIELD TO BE
BEST IN WORLD
The most wonderful track in the
world—that's this new Angell Field.
Pretty powerful words, perhaps, but
based upon pure, unadulterated
fact. For if time, effort, thought, and
care plus unexcelled materials can
build the Utopian track, Stanford
will soon have it.
Ever met Sam McDonald? Well,
Sam's the gentleman who worked
on Angell Field No. 1 'way back
in 1900 and, as the present Stan
ford supervisor of yards and
buildings, is superintending the
construction of Angell Field, edi
tion No. 2.
Sam's autobiography during his
long stay on the Stanford Farm
would be mighty interesting. A col
umn about his meticulous super
vision of the new field would be
warranted. But Sam isn't that way.
He hates publicity.
So it was only after receiving a
staunch promise that a story would
be written about his pride and joy,
Angell Field, and not about Sam
McDonald himself, did he consent to
part with the information that made
this little piece possible. And before
Sam lays plans to decapitate one
sports scribe, this bit had better be
turned to talk of Angell Field.
There is a common misbelief that
a running track is a graded oval
runway with cinders thrown on top.
That would have been true back in
the days of Angell Field No. 1, for
that is exactly how the old oval was
constructed. Except that they used
earthquake debris to build the run
way foundation.
HERE'S THE WAY
THEY'RE DOING IT
But, by contrast, here's what's
been happening over on that same
spot lately. First the old runway
was graded down nearly 2 feet be
low the original level, the sunken
infield built up to the same height,
and a new track bed lain over the
old. That was done shortly after
work began on July 20, with the
surveying supervised by Professor
Charles Moser.
The new foundation was the
best — imported macadam rock
base three inches thick. That's to
act as a drainhoard under the ac
tual track surface.
Over the foundation goes an inch
and one-half of redwood bark, rot
proof, to give the necessary cushion.
And next an inch of gravel. Then
half an inch of clay. That's the be
ginning.
Next comes a one-inch layer of
clinker, the larger pieces of slag
which are left after the cinders have
been strained. Then another half
inch layer, this time one-third cin
ders and one-third clay.
And now for the final step—a
surface coating of cinders and clay
mixed half and half. Eight levels
where there used to be two. and a
cushion of the finest material to
prevent the team-wrecking shin
splints that sunk Stafford's track
chances last year.
Within a turfed infield are high,
broad jump, and pole vault pits, shot
put, and javelin. Discus will go out
side.
Track and jump runways are
equipped with the most efficient
drainage system known. It in
volves a continuous tile viaduct
set about two feet below the track
level and running around the en
tire oval.
