# Al Alustiza Outstanding In Practice
## Frosh Flash Runs Wild; Yearlings Prepare For Trojan Game 
### Bob Leland 
Stockton's coming man of des
tiny flashed in last night's scrim
mage between frosh and grey squads.
A1 Alustiza is the name. Tab it for
future reference.
Running wide and slanting sharp
ly off the tackles, the young Basque
clearly demonstrated that he has
what it takes. If not first-string
calibre just yet, he is at least a bang
up sub for Bill Kirsch at the right
halfback position.
For the first time in practice, the
frosh really put on the pressure and
ran the greys ragged. Of course they
were stopped on some occasions, but
for the most part only minor dif
ficulties kept them from hitting the
end zone more often than they did.
Frosh Score Thrice
As it was, they scored three times.
The first one came after a long pass.
Henry Glasser to Bill Hawkins.
Alustiza took the ball on a reverse
and swept around the grey right
flank and into the end zone. The
frosh were then given the ball on
their 20-yard line, and on the first
play, Alustiza hit off tackle on a re
verse and, twisting loose from two
tacklers, ran SO yards for the second
score.
The third came soon after on a
more or less sustained drive. Glasser,
Jordan, and Alustiza carried the ball
and the score resulted from a pass
to Alustiza. Quite a day for the
Stockton boy.
Coach Jimmy Bradshaw stressed
the new plays installed for the
U.S.C. contest, and of course after
they had been run twice in a row,
the greys anticipated them and the
frosh got nowhere fast.
Reserves Used
The scrimmage found several new
faces in the line-up, Bradshaw wish
ing to give some of his reserves ex
perience in running plays. Ken
Jordan, fullback; Glasser and Alus
tiza, halfbacks; Don Butler and Bill
Hawkins, ends; John and Byron
West, tackles, were the new men.
Dick Sutton, center; Fred Gustafson
and Frank McMillan, guards, were
the only regulars.
While the first and second string
ers worked to perfect an attack, the
fourth string under Assistant Coach
John Bunn got off in a corner of the
field and worked S.C. plays.
Irv Cummings, injured end, was
out at the field in civilian clothes,
but Hank Huebel was in a suit and
running plays with the second team.
