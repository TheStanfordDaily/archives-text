# Water Poloists Meet Athens Club Tomorrow
## 
### 
When Coach Nort Thornton's
water poloists tangle with the Ath
ens Club tomorrow night in a return
conference game, the Indians will
have a fast offensive, as well as their
all-conference ,d e fensive unit.
Ten days ago the Cards just man
aged to beat the club, 3-2, but that
was before Thornton had time to
whip into shape a set of forwards
who could play big league ball. To
morrow night Bob Hoover, Bill
Clemo, and Bob Gif Ten will be the
sought-for forwards. Thornton
smiles as he intimates that they are
all set to roll up a more presentable
score.
Defense Good
For the defensive, Thornton has
no wfirry. Co-captains Wally Wiget
and Bill Woodard, both all-confer
ence last year, and Sud Sutherland
will man the guard posts. Bob Has
lacher plays in the goalie's cage.
No set-up is the Club team, how
ever. Included in their starting
line-up are Denny Driggs, former
Stanford water polo captain; Jim
McCay, former California captain;
and Gordon Corson, ex-Oregon star
and veteran of many aquatic events
around the bay.
Frosh Preliminary
Starting at 8:30 o'clock, the fresh
men will take on the Athens re
serves in an attempt to avenge their
defeat in the first game. That defeat
was suffered at a time when the
frosh had had only five days of
practice, so they will be a little bet
ter able to handle themselves to
morrow night.
Also on the bill is a program of
exhibition diving by Roy Winkelman
of the fresh, who last year was ail-
American interscholastic champion
from Pennsylvania.
