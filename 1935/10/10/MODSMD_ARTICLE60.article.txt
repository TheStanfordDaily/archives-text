# Cub Boss Predicts 1936 Championship

CHICAGO, Oct. 8 (/P).â€”Charlie
Grimm is convinced his Cubs; as
now constituted, can win the Na
tional League pennant next year
and with added experience, the
world's championship, too.
"I am satisfied to stand pat on
the present line-up," Grimm said
Tuesday, "and intend to do it. I
think the squad we now have is
good for three or four years more,
and I am going to string along with
them. Of course I would like to get
another starting pitcher, but I will
not weaken the club in other de
partments to make a trade to get
one."
