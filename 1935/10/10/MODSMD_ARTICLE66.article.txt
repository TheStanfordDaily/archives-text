# "Let the Winds of Freedom Blow"
## Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily Member of the Associated Press Changing of Student Officers Presents Pitfall to New Round-Table Discussions 
### 
The Hound Table Conference, current stu
dent regime's biggest accomplishment to date,
was placed firmly on its feet when the first
discussion meeting Tuesday drew a definite
and united Ex Committee decision that the
program of bi-weekly instruction and discus
sion of student problems be continued.
Ex Committee, however, showed little favor
to the suggestion that membership in the Con
ference be enlarged. This move was ruled
out at Tuesday night's meeting because the
campus administrators believed a larger
group would curtail free discussion.
The main difficulty with the exclusive set
up of the Conference now is that it provides
Jitlle continuity through the last half of the
school year. Of tlie present members, about
half will leave the group after the February
elections; the other half will hold oflijce for
the remainder of the year.
Consequently, it the February initiates are
unacquainted with the problems discussed in
the first half term, the oulv way the purpose
of the Conference —the education of student

leaders in campus administration—can be
fulfilled will be by repetition of the questions
taken up during the first term. This obviousjy
would work a hardship on the veteran mem
bers.
A possible method of righting this situation,
then, might be in slightly extending the mem
bership to cover the candidates for student
offices in February. Since this group might
prove too large to encourage open discussion
of problems, as Ex Committee feared, it could
be limited by empowering President Wallv
Brooke to accept or reject applications for
attendance. In this manner, the program
would be given the continuity which it now
lacks and which will be essential to its future
success as an A.S.S.U. policy.
The Itound-Table Conference plan appar
ently is so assured of effectiveness and success
that it would be folly to endanger its future
by failure to foresee the barrier that will
obstruct its path in February and again with
every semi-annual change in the personnel of
student government.
