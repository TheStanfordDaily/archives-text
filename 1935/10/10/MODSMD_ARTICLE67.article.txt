# Ten Per Cent of the Campus Illiterate, Voting Reveals
## 
### 
More than ten per cent of the Stanford stu
dent body is illiterate. This would be an
almost justifiable deduction by election board
ollicers who counted ballots in Tuesday's
A.S.S.LI, election. Seventy-live of the (>7(» votes
cast were disqualified because they were in
correctly marked.
The preferential system used in student
elections admittedly furnishes a complicated
task for the election board, but instructions
to voters are so plainly printed on every bal
lot that they can leave no doubt in the think
ing student's mind as to the method of indi
cating his preference.
The printed instructions contain such sim
ple, clear warnings as "any mark or marks
on any part or parts of this ballot except the
intended 4 x' or the attachment of any write-in
slip, makes this ballot void," and "ballots
must be marked in ink."
And yet 7,"i out of (»7(» votes were rejected
Tuesday. The situation is comparable to the
student who 11 linked a final because "he didn't
see the third question."
