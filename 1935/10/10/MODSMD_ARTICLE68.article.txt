# Stanford's Place in the Sun

Old students who neglected to drop around
to yesterday's "Welcome" Assembly missed
Comptroller Al Roth's talk 011 Stanford's
problems and her place in the collegiate sun.
Although Stanford's endowment was Amer
ica's richest in 1920, and many still think of
the school as a wealthy one, the Farm now
ranks but sixth in this country in dollars of
endowment. In dollars per capita it is much
lower, being twenty-first. Both pointed out
that it will help Stanford to regain her place
if students act as "salesmen" for the Uni
versity to the outside world.
Several descriptions of the superlative type
generally ascribed to Southern California
were found to apply to Stanford. For ex
ample, the campus is next to the largest of
any university in the world, being surpassed
by only one school—a denominational negro
one in Tennessee. Also, the University has
the finest site in the world for large-scale
botanical gardens, according to botany ex
perts planning for the indefinite future.
The acid lest of the depression was stood
comparatively well by Stanford—thanks to
the new women, according to Roth. Only a
10 pei f cent pay cut to faculty, which has been
but half restored, is visible. It is to Stanford
students' interest to see this restored so that
the University will be able to compete with

America's best for professors.
Dark side is that Stanford's income will not
bounce back to "normal" in the next live
years, because expiring bonds will have to
be re-invested at lower interest rates, reduc
ing income by about two hundred thousand
dollars annually.
But a University that has overcome obsta
cles furnished by legislatures, earthquakes,
wars, and depressions, is not likely to let such
a small matter block its onward course.
