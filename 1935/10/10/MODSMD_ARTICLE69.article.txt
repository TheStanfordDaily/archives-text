an set out from Roble to find a friend of hers who was
supposed to be living in Madrono Hall. Her directions
were a bit sketchy, but she finally found a nice, brown

"My, how popular these girls arc!" she said to her
self as she saw many men sitting around in the parlor.
She started to go upstairs to find her friend, but was
astonished to see a man walking down from the second
floor."
"Isn't this Madrono?" she said to himself.
"No,' 'replied he, "this belongs to the D.U. building
