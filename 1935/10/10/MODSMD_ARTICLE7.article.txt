### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 9 (A'). â€”With
gesticulation and perspiration, Gov
ernor Eugene Talmadge of Georgia
told a dignified Board of Trade
luncheon today that the government
is "gambling wtih God and playing
a losing game" by its crop restric
tions and that it is stifling religion
by its relief activities.
The governor kept his audience
laughing and applauding for more
than an hour with homely thrusts at
President Roosevelt and the New
Deal.
