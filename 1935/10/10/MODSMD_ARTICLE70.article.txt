# Farm Road System Finally Gets a Partial Overhauling
## 
### 
With the approval of the Comptroller's
ollice secured, a much-needed program of
road improvements on the campus will be
inaugurated soon. Budget restrictions limit
the plans to resurfacing and oiling of the
rougher and drier University roads, but on
the whole the program will furnish a big
improvement in Stanford's highway system.
However, there are several dangerous and
annoying spots that have been overlooked.
The Administration's next road-building pro
gram would do well to pay some attention
to the network of thoroughfares running
through the athletic fields, the intersection
of Galvez and Pine streets north of the 8.A.C.,
the road from the Museum to the Convales
cent Home, and corduroyed and bumpy Palm
Drive.
