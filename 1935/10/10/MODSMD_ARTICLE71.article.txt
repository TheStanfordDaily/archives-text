# Bull Session
## 10 AND 40/100 PER CENT IMPURE 
### 
Like near-bear to a drunkard is printed propaganda
to Mr. America. Daily, thousands of us, collegiate and
non-collegiate, turn past sci'eaming front page editor
ials with an easy unconcern. As far as we are con
cerned, the editorial angels of vengeance have worn
their voices down to a hoarse croak. We have, para
doxically, lost a habit, because it was overindulged.
To say that the generals of print do not realize the
day of lingual and typographical propaganda is done,
is to vastly under-rate them. And to think they have
not sought and found new pastures long before this is
to be asleep to the most dangerous move those gentle
men have yet made.
It is a sharp jolt to learn that a survey completed
by disinterested sociology students shows that 10.4 per
cent of all items in movie newsreels deals favorably
with militarism, that imperialism rates 5.9 per cent,
and that anti-militarism and education rate 3.6 and
3.3 per cent, respectively.
More appalling than the figures themselves, and
keenly indicative of this new kind of proselyting to
causes favored by the movie interests, is the fact that
few movie-goers realize until they see the report just
what they are absorbing from theater screens.
We of Stanford conventionally hold ourselves above
the influence of propaganda. We are schooled to a nice
disregard of opinionation and editorializing in the news,
to balance word against thought, and innuendo against
fact.
With confidence in our own mental smelling pow
ers, we remember the special newsreels issued during
the Merriam-Sinclair campaign, picturing bums with
phony accents speaking for Epic, and well-dressed
citizens for Merriam, recollecting how easily we spot
ted the fine florentine hand of Hollywood's movie
moguls.
Since then, movie-makers have absolutely mas
tered the art of innuendo. If you don't believe so, try
to remember the last examples of movie propagandizing
you consciously recognized as such.
If you can't remember, please realize that accurately
prepared figures indicate those you did see perhaps
unconsciously influenced you for or against the thing
some single man supported or condemned.
Formerly, the university was the bulwark of sound
thinking against the distorted facts printed in the news.
But such propaganda was open to inspection, as long
lived as the paper on which it was printed. If you
didn't catch the bias today, you might catch it tomor
row on second reading.
Today, every man of us enters a movie to relax, and
has poured into his eyes and ears the special brand of
entertaining poison that can't be caught and run to
ground, the kind that hits those who can read and
understand just as effectively as the thousands who
never read a paper. —Bob Eisenbach

But such propaganda was open to inspection, as long
lived as the paper on which it was printed. If you
didn't catch the bias today, you might catch it tomor
row on second reading.
Today, every man of us enters a movie to relax, and
has poured into his eyes and ears the special brand of
entertaining poison that can't be caught and run to
ground, the kind that hits those who can read and
understand just as effectively as the thousands who
never read a paper. —Bob Eisenbach
Like near-bear to a drunkard is printed propaganda
to Mr. America. Daily, thousands of us, collegiate and
non-collegiate, turn past sci'eaming front page editor
ials with an easy unconcern. As far as we are con
cerned, the editorial angels of vengeance have worn
their voices down to a hoarse croak. We have, para
doxically, lost a habit, because it was overindulged.
To say that the generals of print do not realize the
day of lingual and typographical propaganda is done,
is to vastly under-rate them. And to think they have
not sought and found new pastures long before this is
to be asleep to the most dangerous move those gentle
men have yet made.
It is a sharp jolt to learn that a survey completed
by disinterested sociology students shows that 10.4 per
cent of all items in movie newsreels deals favorably
with militarism, that imperialism rates 5.9 per cent,
and that anti-militarism and education rate 3.6 and
3.3 per cent, respectively.
More appalling than the figures themselves, and
keenly indicative of this new kind of proselyting to
causes favored by the movie interests, is the fact that
few movie-goers realize until they see the report just
what they are absorbing from theater screens.
We of Stanford conventionally hold ourselves above
the influence of propaganda. We are schooled to a nice
disregard of opinionation and editorializing in the news,
to balance word against thought, and innuendo against
fact.
With confidence in our own mental smelling pow
ers, we remember the special newsreels issued during
the Merriam-Sinclair campaign, picturing bums with
phony accents speaking for Epic, and well-dressed
citizens for Merriam, recollecting how easily we spot
ted the fine florentine hand of Hollywood's movie
moguls.
Since then, movie-makers have absolutely mas
tered the art of innuendo. If you don't believe so, try
to remember the last examples of movie propagandizing
you consciously recognized as such.
If you can't remember, please realize that accurately
prepared figures indicate those you did see perhaps
unconsciously influenced you for or against the thing
some single man supported or condemned.
Formerly, the university was the bulwark of sound
thinking against the distorted facts printed in the news.
