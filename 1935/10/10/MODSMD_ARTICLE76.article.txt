# DIANA'S DIARY

### THE CO-ED SHOPPER 
October 10
Dear Diary:
Ted's due any minute now for a
! movie date, but p'rhaps I've time to
i dash off the week's doings. I just
relayed them home to Mother on
some of that elegant stationery I
: got at WIGHTMAN'S, 366 Univer
sity—you've got to see it to believe
it. Roomie and I thought something
had to be done to fix up our diggings
so we decided to go Oriental. DIX
IT'S, 165 University, is the only real
India shop in town —he's a Stanford
grad—and there we got swell hand
| embroidered Numdah rugs and
bright wall prints. Terribly inex
pensive, but how they improve the
place. Speaking of improvements,
everyone's noticing how much bet
ter my complexion looks since I got
my Alexandra de Markoff cosmetic
set at the UNIVERSITY PHAR
MACY, 134 University. I warned
the gals the special price is over on
October 15. The way to a man's
heart must be through his nose—l
mean it. Ted said he'd never smelled
anything as exotic as the Lucien Le
long Whisper I got at BAKER'S, 571
University. They've got those clever
penthouse sets of four small bottles
in one penthouse apartment. With
the room so gorgeous I needed some
thing fancy to study in, so I got a
hand-dyed and blocked smock in
bright orange with full sleeves. Of
course it was at the THREE SAIL
ORS, 337 Hamilton, that's becoming

Paly's smart art center. I managed
to squeeze in a little study, believe it
or not. A lucky break was discover
ing that the ASSOCIATED STEN
OGRAPHERS, 266 University, make
a special rate for weekly papers —
their swell typing always drags an
A. Another headline in this week's
bargain is MARIAN SEIMAS' sale
of nighties. They're grand trillium
in tea rose and white, priced from
$3.50 to $3.95 for only $2.95. I'm so
proud of my flower decorations for
Tuesday's faculty dinner. They were
a combination of yellow marguerites,
cornflowers, and small chrysanthe
mums from THE FLOWER SHOP,
175 University. I must dress now
for the date. Ted is as nice as ever,
incidentally. Guess I'll wear my new
Quad costume from MARY ELIZ
ABETH'S, 119 University. It's a
brown two-piece knit—very sporty
—with a swell swagger coat in brown
and tan plaid. With it, I'll wear a
brown sailor with a smart rolled
brim. The best thing about her
clothes is the price that fits the al
lowance. Tlie shoes are from the
WALK-OVER, 220 University, and
they're brown pigskin sport oxfords
with a fringed tongue — made to
stand the campus gaff. My hair
looks marvelous—thanks to LYDIA*.
460 University. I got one of her
Salakuta shampoos that brings out
the hair's natural color and is a
scalp treatment and a hair re-con
ditioner in one. (adv.)

Quad costume from MARY ELIZ
ABETH'S, 119 University. It's a
brown two-piece knit—very sporty
—with a swell swagger coat in brown
and tan plaid. With it, I'll wear a
brown sailor with a smart rolled
brim. The best thing about her
clothes is the price that fits the al
lowance. Tlie shoes are from the
WALK-OVER, 220 University, and
they're brown pigskin sport oxfords
with a fringed tongue — made to
stand the campus gaff. My hair
looks marvelous—thanks to LYDIA*.

Salakuta shampoos that brings out
the hair's natural color and is a
scalp treatment and a hair re-con

Dear Diary:
Ted's due any minute now for a
! movie date, but p'rhaps I've time to
i dash off the week's doings. I just
relayed them home to Mother on
some of that elegant stationery I
: got at WIGHTMAN'S, 366 Univer
sity—you've got to see it to believe
it. Roomie and I thought something
had to be done to fix up our diggings
so we decided to go Oriental. DIX
IT'S, 165 University, is the only real
India shop in town —he's a Stanford
grad—and there we got swell hand
| embroidered Numdah rugs and
bright wall prints. Terribly inex
pensive, but how they improve the
place. Speaking of improvements,
everyone's noticing how much bet
ter my complexion looks since I got
my Alexandra de Markoff cosmetic
set at the UNIVERSITY PHAR
MACY, 134 University. I warned
the gals the special price is over on
October 15. The way to a man's
heart must be through his nose—l
mean it. Ted said he'd never smelled
anything as exotic as the Lucien Le
long Whisper I got at BAKER'S, 571
University. They've got those clever
penthouse sets of four small bottles
in one penthouse apartment. With
the room so gorgeous I needed some
thing fancy to study in, so I got a
hand-dyed and blocked smock in
bright orange with full sleeves. Of
course it was at the THREE SAIL
ORS, 337 Hamilton, that's becoming

Paly's smart art center. I managed
to squeeze in a little study, believe it
or not. A lucky break was discover
ing that the ASSOCIATED STEN
OGRAPHERS, 266 University, make
a special rate for weekly papers —
their swell typing always drags an
A. Another headline in this week's
bargain is MARIAN SEIMAS' sale
of nighties. They're grand trillium
in tea rose and white, priced from
$3.50 to $3.95 for only $2.95. I'm so
proud of my flower decorations for
Tuesday's faculty dinner. They were
a combination of yellow marguerites,
cornflowers, and small chrysanthe
mums from THE FLOWER SHOP,
175 University. I must dress now
for the date. Ted is as nice as ever,
incidentally. Guess I'll wear my new
