# New Lower Division Grade Requirements Made by Committee
## Nine Quarters Allowed For Attainment Of 'C' Average 
### 
Lower division students regis
tered after September 1, 1935, and
all students in the lower division
after September 1, 1937, will have
only nine quarters, instead of 15, to
secure a "C" average or pay the
penalty of rolling out, according to
new requirements announced yes
terday by the Scholarship Commit
tee.
Meanwhile, the three bases up
on which probation and disquali
fication could formerly be incur
red have been replaced by one
system, which will maintain schol
astic standards approximately as
they were and will he more read
ily understood and enforced.
Under the system formerly in
force, probation and disqualifica
tion could be incurred by a stated
deficiency in gradepoints on the

work of any one quarter or on a
stated deficiency of accumulated
grade-points in the work of a num
ber of quarters.
Disqualification alone could also
be incurred by students on proba
tion whose scholarship records fell
below a "C" average during each of
two successive quarters following
assumption of probationary status.
The new system provides that both
probation and disqualification are
inclinable only on the accumulated
deficiency of grade-points on the
work of two or more successive
quarters.
With the roll-out deadline moved
up, students may be only minus 11
at the end of their sixth quarter of
attendance without incurring dis
qualification, instead of the former
minus 13, and are granted only three
quarters more to make their aver
age a "C" instead of Ihe former nine
quarters.
in other words, the climb to a
"C" average is spread over a pe
riod of only three years instead of
five; or, conversely, the "zero
hour" formerly at the end of 15
quarters of attendance, is now at
the end of nine quarters.
The new scholarship table, show
ing deficiencies sufficient for the in
currence of probation and disquali
fication, is given in the inserted box.
Comparison with the old scale
shows almost no change in scholar
ship requirements for the first year,
a slight stiffening during the second
year, and decidedly stricter require
ments during the third year.
