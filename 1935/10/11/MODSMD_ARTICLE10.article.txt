# Coghlan Warns Of Activity Cut
## Rally Group Head Urges Rooters To Co-operate 
### 
"Because students in many cases
have refused to buy their rooters'
caps from the official agency, which
is the only place where the Rally
Committee receives the profits from
the caps, the Rally Committee will
be forced to greatly curtail its activ
ities this year," stated Phil Coghlan,
committee head, last night.
Rallies and the expense of send
ing yell leaders and Rally men to
the IJ.S.C. game will be costly, and
unless students will co-operate with
the committee there wiil be neither
yell-leaders nor committeemen at
that game, Coghlan added.
Due to numerous complaints,
from those holding tickets next, to
the Card rooting section, that stu
dents jam the tunnels and impair
vision while being seated, Card'root
ers will enter the stadium through
Gate G this year rather than through
Gate F as has been the custom in
(he past. Gate G is one gate east of
Gate F.
The Rally Committee will seat
students by rows as they enter,
which means that all rooters who
expect to sit with friends should
come with them, Coghlan said.
All those who come to the frosh
game in caps and shirts will be al
lowed to enter the section, but will
have to keep the same seats during
the varsity game to avoid confusion.
