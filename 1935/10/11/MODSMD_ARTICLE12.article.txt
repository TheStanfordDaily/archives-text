# Debate Season Opens Over Air
## Stanford â€“ U.C.L.A. Men To Team Tomorrow 
### 
J Inaugurating the forensic program
I of the year, Stanford varsity deba
j ters take to the air tomorrow after
noon. Ed Butterworth and Robert
McKenzie meet Charles Wellman
I and Ted Lambert of the U.C.L.A.
varsity squad over KGO from 1 to
| 1:30 o'clock on the question, "Re
j solved that fraternities should be
| abolished on the Stanford-U.C.L.A.
1 campi."
Because the matter of fraternities
is a touching problem and question
to both campi, this verbal clash will
be in the form of a split-team de
i bate, which calls for one Stanford
| and one U.C.L.A. man to defend the
question, while the other two op
pose the proposition. In this way,
neither school will be charged with
favoring or opposing the subject.
The visiting debaters are experi
' enced speakers, and claim the dis-
I tinction of being the only team to
| have beaten Stanford's combination
of Bill Rogers and Dave Mellinkoff,
champions of the Western Collegiate
tournament held at Salt Lake City
in November last year.
McKenzie and Butterworth are
experienced speakers, the former
being one of the Joffre Debate par
ticipants, and the latter having taken
part in numerous clashes.
