HAIL, STANFORD, IIAIL!
(The Hymn)

Up toward mountains higher,
Where at eve the Coast Range lies
In the sunset fire,
Flushing deep and paling,
Here, we raise our voices, hailing
Thee, our Alma Mater.

As we sing
It shall ring and float away.
Hail, Stanford. Hail!
Hail, Stanford, Hail!
Tender vistas ever new
Through the arches meet the eyes
Where the red roofs rim the skies
Flecked with cloudlets sailing,
Here we raise our voices, hailing
Thee, our Alma Mater.
