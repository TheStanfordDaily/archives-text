# Indians Ready To Clash With Uclan Gridmen
## West wood Squad Comes To Farm Believing It Will Triumph 
### Gordy Frost 
Stanford is ready.
From the Westwood hills come
3500 Bruins, aggressive, with one
hope—"stop Stanford." With them is
a fine, smooth Bruin football team,
headed by an all-American candi
date, "Chuck" Cheshire, eager to
meet the Stanford Indian, conquer
it, and upset the most highly touted
football club on the Pacific.
Tomorrow afternoon when the In
dians meet U.C.L.A.'s Bruins on the

Stanford Stadium grid, it will be as
finely balanced a team of Cardinal
football experts as Stanford has put
on the field in recent years.
Grayson To Start
In every department is strength,
and where a week ago injuries left
several doubtful spots, all but one
of the original first stringers are
back, anxious to show their mettle.
In the backfield All-American
Bt)bby Grayson X'eturns to his full
back post to direct plays, Frankie
Alustiza and Bones Hamilton to their
regular halfback jobs, and Bill
Paulman to quarter—the original
backs that Tiny Thornhill has pin
ned hopes for a conference victory
this year.
And in case Hamilton's arch,
still not completely strong, fails to
hold, there will be Joe Vigna or
little Jimmy CofTis to hold up the
wing.
It will be the first time in two
weeks and the second time this sea
son that Stanford has sent its first
string, twelve-threat backfield onto
the field.
But the forward wall has been
given the test against two powerful
lines this season, and shown its
strength. Guard Woody Adams, still
bothered with an injured leg, prob
ably won't be doing much playing,
l however.
Adams Still Out
Woody's bum limb doesn't mvtke
i itself known on straight running,
but a little cutting from side to side
; puts him out of commission. Thorn
| hill is still using Bob Black, who's
I giving Adams a mighty strong run
; for his money anyway, in the guard
position tomorrow.
At center Wes Muller has received
; the call over his rival, Alf Brandin,
1 and thus marks one more stage in
j the Brandin-Muller fight for the
I first-string job.
Tlius when Tiny's team takes
the field tomorrow it will have
i strength in line and backfield, but
\ there will be more than that. There
j will he experience.
For two years the same squad,
; with two exceptions, has run through
( unbeaten conference seasons. To
morrow they start a third and the
} outcome of that match will quite
J definitely decide whether they are
! headed for another or not.
Bruin Line Strong
Bill Spaulding's Bruins bring to
; Stanford a "better than average
team" as Husky Hunt describes
I them. There are a score of strong
< points and a few weak.
On the line they have power, al
most equal to that of the Indians.
Their front defense, which averages
over 200 pounds, succeeded in stav
ing off many an O.S.C. thrust last
I Saturday.
They have the besfe of speed
burners in Mr. Cheshire, for whom
they're already casting votes for
all-American this year. Cheshire
is a 10 flat man, and on top of
that can kick and pass. He's not
ed for his drifting method of pass
ing and will probably be seen
throwing on the run tomorrow.
And then there's Tex Key, who
raises the needle to over the 200-
pound mark, and is the last word in
plunging fullbacks. And Fred Funk
who plays opposite Cheshire in the
halfback role is a good passer tncl
kicker.
Yes, there is Bruin strength, but
Stanford, is ready.
