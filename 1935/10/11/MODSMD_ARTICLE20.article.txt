WESTWOOD, Oct. 10 (Special to
The Daily).—We are not going north
to get beat!
These eight little words today ex
pressed the thoughts of thirty-five
hundred Bruin students, football
team included, as the huge West
wood entourage headed northward
for Saturday's game in the Stanford
Stadium, which will make or break
the hopes of the best grid machine
ever to roll out of the bluehills to
the south.
High Spirit Seen
The highest spirit seen in the local
camp in years was displayed last
night at Spaulding Field as the
Bruin mentor drove an inspired var
sity through its final workout.
Everyone from the team doctor to
the third assistant water boy
seemed to sense the situation and
gives El Bruin the best chance that
he has had in years to score an
upset that would shake the coast
conference to the proverbial founda
tion and also give Charley Cheshire
an all-American berth.
Look Toward Bowl
For the first time in history a
Bruin student body is looking Rose
Bowlward and the thirty-five hun
dred Westwood excursioners swing
ing northward by train, bus, boat,
airplane, private automobiles, and
even the aid of a good right thumb,
look to see the Stanford Indians
bowled over by the inspired Bruins.
It is remotely possible that the
Westwooders might not win but
there is one certainty regarding Sat
urday's tussle—the Bruins won't be
building character at Stanford Sta
dium.
