# Freshmen To Elect Officers Next Week
## 
### 
The freshman group should be
looking around to see who it wants
to lead its class, as frosh officers will
be elected some time next week,
Gordon Mallalratt, head sponsor at
Encina, announced yesterday.
Early next week the sponsors in
the various dining rooms will pass
out nomination blanks on which the
frosh will place their choices for the
respective class officers. Later in the
week a general assembly will be
held at Encina and the nominees
will be voted on.
