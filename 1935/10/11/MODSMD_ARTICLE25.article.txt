# Buck Explains War Troubles
## France Finds Herself On Both Sides of Fence 
### 
Conditions leading up to and fol
lowing the outbreak of the Italian
war in East Africa were outlined in
an informal discussion by Professor
P. W. Buck yesterday, when he ad
dressed the first autumn quarter
meeting of the International Rela
tions Club.
The actual war outbreak, arising
out of boundary differences in
Ethiopia, takes on a new significance,
according to the political science in
structor, when the effects on Europe
are considered.
France finds herself in the uncom
fortable position of being allied with
Italy for the purpose of stifling Ger
man rearmament ambitions, and at
the same time desiring to maintain
her prestige as far as the League is
concerned by frowning on II Duce's
imperialism in Africa.
Declaring that Fascist advances
into Ethiopia proper have not been
extensive, Buck pointed out that the
League may call on an international
police force to coerce Italy.
Concluding the discussion, Buck
expressed his doubl that the United
States would maintain her policy of
strict neutrality throughout the
duration of the war.
