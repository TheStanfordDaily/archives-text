# Fiscal Policies Menace Stanford, Says Hoover
## Trained Brain Need of U.S., Wilbur States Stanford Associates Hear Famous Alumni In N.Y. Meeting

Privately-endowed universities,
Stanford among them, are being
menaced by fiscal and monetary
policies of the Roosevelt adminis
tration, a threat that is decreasing
(he effectiveness of the nation's pri
vate colleges in dealing with human
problems, former President Herbert.
Hoover told a distinguished audi
ence of Stanford alumni last night in
the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New
York City, according to the Asso
ciated Press.
Private Colleges Freer
Among the nation's colleges, "cita
dels of freedom," those of independ
ent endowment are "more free to
explore new spheres of life and
thought and to experiment in edu
cation and research," Mr. Hoover
declared.
The endowment upon which their
life and independence are based are
being undermined by our national
currency policies, he maintained.
"Those policies of our govern
ment, including a rapidly increas
ing public debt, based upon bank
credit inflation, together with the
revaluation of the dollar, inevi
tably depreciates the purchasing
power of these endowments," dis
patches quoted him as saying.
"Already we are experiencing the
effects of fear of the consequences of
these policies. Every board of trus
tees in the country is concerned to
day with this problem."
"Cannot Allow Ivoss
"Somehow, someway," he con
cluded, "we cannot allow these in
stitutions to suffer loss of strength.
It is from them that must spring the
refreshing waters of freedom. It is
in them that the nation holds that
link of the past to the vision of the
future which supports all civiliza
tion."
Potentialities of the human brain
for removing the destructive emo
tional and mental currents from
our lives, and the university's ability
to protect biologic values and en
courage their development was the
gist of the main address by Ray Ly
man Wilbur.
"We need further studies to de
termine the end results of the pres
ervation of the physically and men
tally handicapped through modern
science or applied biology," he de
clared. "Nothing is more hit and
miss than our human breeding.
"The widespread efforts for
birth control have, with present*
methods, been most effective
among those on the higher intel
lectual levels, so that the race is
being bred down and not up. We
would not dream of treating a
strain of race horses the way we
do ourselves."
It is the duty of the University, lie
said, to help us to objectively ob
serve ourselves as we are. "We can
go pell-mell to lower levels through
lack of control and understanding,"
he warned, "or we can rise to divine
heights through the use of our
brains mixed with spirituality ard
idealism."
Biological Laws Omniscient
Dr. Wilbur pointed out the fact
that society cannot escape the laws
of biology.
