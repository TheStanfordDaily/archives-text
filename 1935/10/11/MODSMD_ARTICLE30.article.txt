Shortly after the historic meeting,
an Italian spokesman told the As

naval blockade to back up sanctions,
"it means war."
Italy, he disclosed, plans upon
getting necessaries from Germany
through Austria and does not fear
economic sanctions.
With Austria and Hungary re
fraining from sanctions, the eco

Rome. Because of this, attention at
once centered on possible naval
sanctions.
It was also hinted pressure of

two dissenters, Austria and Hun
gary.
Fifty of the 59 members of the
assembly went definitely on record
in favor of economic and financial

formed for enforcement of the pres

A furious protest against the
latest sanctions move was made t

the Italian delegation. A spokes
man said the Italian delegation,
