LINCOLN, Neb., Oct. 10 (JP).â€” |
Dr. L. Foster Wood of New York
City told pastors attending the Ne- j
braska Baptist convention here they
should have a "pre-marital heart to !
heart talk with every couple" they
marry.
"The procedure," he said, "results j
in a remarkable decrease in the
number of divorces. The minister :
should follow the couple and serve
as a spiritual guide and counsel.
Marriages temporarily sick may be
made well again."
Prisoners at Fort Scott, Kansas,
must wait their turn to serve sen- j,
tences in the Bourbon County jail,
which is filled to its capacity of 25.
