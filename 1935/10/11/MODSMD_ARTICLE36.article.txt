# CAMPUS SPEED LAWS
## 
### 
Ths Editor, Sir:
I wish to point out several gross
inaccuracies in the story on the stu
dent government round-table dis
cussion in a recent Daily.
In the first place, no traffic violator
"hurled a challenge" at Men's
Council. I was the violator referred
to, and although I did discuss the
matter with Bob Gros and Comp
troller Almon E. Roth beforehand,
1 hurled no challenges and docilely
pleaded guilty when arraigned.
In the .second place, although the
article implied otherwise, campu:
roads are under the jurisdiction ol
the California Motor Vehicle Act
There is a specific provision in th(
act that .says so. Men's Council
however, ignores the provisions ol
this law relating to speed limits anc
enforces only its own, more lenient
provisions.
What I am attempting to do is tc
persuade the council to enforce it;
rules in the same way that the staU
law is enforced. That is, excessive
speed is only prima facie, not con
clusive evidence of law violation. I
one can prove that his speed was no
dangerous to life, Imib, or property
he is innocent. Enforcement in thi:
manner would he a progressive stej
in the administration of student af
fairs. P. B.
You could drive slower.â€”Ed.
