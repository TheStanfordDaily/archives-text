# Brooke Would Enjoy Faculty Edition of Daily
## Professors, Students Give Varied Views on Idea 
### 
In answer to the agitation for a
faculty edition of The Daily, started
by faculty comments on the paper
and an answering editorial, A.S.S.U.
President Wally Brooke gives the
opinion that "I'd like to see a faculty
edition. It ought to be amusing and
enlightening and a very different
paper."
Student opposition to the plan
comes from Bob Gros, student man
ager and chairman of Men's Council,
who says, "It's a crazy idea and I'm
all agin' it! The Daily is a student
paper, and its criteria of success
should be to satisfy the student body
and not the faculty."
Bush Gives View
Of the faculty, Professor Chilton R.
Bush of the journalism department
makes the statement:
"Such a paper would reflect an en
tirely different set of news values
than the regular student edited edi
tions. It might be worthwhile as a
demonstration to all college news
papers, that perhaps would result in
some imitation."
Philip W. Buck, instructor in the
political science department, says he
has no complaints about The Daily,
and would not want the task of par
ticipating in putting it out. He adds
that The Daily doesn't have any dif
ficulties, leading to mistakes, which
any paper doesn't run into.
Other Idea
Additional student opinion comes
from Mercedes Bergman, president
of Women's Conference, in the
statement:
"It is an unparalleled opportunity
for the faculty to express themselves
on world questions and campus af
fairs. It would serve as a sabbatical
from writing out exam questions,
and the tedious classroom routine.
We will all be looking for this edi
tion."
