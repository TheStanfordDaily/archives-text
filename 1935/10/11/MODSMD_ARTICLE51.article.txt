# Allies' Omission of Italy Seen In Library Display
## 
### DAVE BOTSFORD 
When the Allied Powers were slic
ing up Germany's colonial posses
sions and giving them away to each
other at the Paris Peace Conference
in 1919, Italy was definitely and
conspicuously forgotten. To show
just how much additional territory
the principal allies received, the
Hoover War Library presents in the
central hall of the library this month
i a complete and compi'ehensive dis
! play of important books, maps, and
official documents.
Colonial Germany, before the
: World War, was spread from
! Africa to the South Seas of the Pa
! cific. Turkey, another central power,
J ruled tyranically over most of Asia
| Minor. When peace was finally
i made in 1919, these vast territories
were placed under a commission of
the League of Nations which pro
ceeded to parcel them out to various
nations as "mandates."
Formerly Turkish, Syria became a |
French protectorate, Iraq, Palestine,
and Arabia British protectorates. I
Great hunks of Africa were turned \
over by the League commission to |
France, Britain, and Belgium. Is
lands in the Pacific became man
dates of New Zealand, Australia, and
Japan.
The Hoover Library's display is i

significant because it makes clear
that while other allies got new lands
one-third the size and one-sixth the
population of the United States,
Italy got nothing.
It is for colonial territory, and
Italy needs it, that II Duce is now
raising this horrible rumpus with
Ethiopia's chocolate emperor. Had
Italy been properly recompensed in
1919, little Haile Selassie, Power of
Trinity and King of Kings, would
probably have remained an obscure
African ruler and Ethiopia just a
place on the map.
In the display cases the War Li
brary has placed official reports of
the colonial governments required
yearly of the mandatory nations by
the League. Copies of the Treaty of
Versailles and the League Cove
nant are laid open to pages which
deal with the one-time German and
Turkish propei'ty. Maps show just
how much territory which once be
longed to the central powers now is
controlled by France, Britain, and
Belgium, and has never been han
dled by Italy.
Kay Francis carries in her purse a
ring she found during her first stage
engagement. She attributes all her
good luck to it.
