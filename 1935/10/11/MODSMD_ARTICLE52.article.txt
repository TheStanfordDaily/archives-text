# Water Poloists Play Club Tonight
## Cards Risk 21- Year Winnings in Contest With Athens Team Yearlings To Play Club Reserves; Diving Also Planned 
### Herb Diamond 
Two evenly matched water polo
squads, both of championship cali
ber, will clash at Encina pools at
8:30 o'clock tonight when Coach
Nort Thornton sends his Stanford
varsity into battle with the power
ful Athens Club team.
Ten days ago the Indians, A.A.U.
and Intercollegiate title holders
throughout the past 21 years, were
barely able to eke out a 3-2 win
over the Athenians.
Offense Stressed
The Stanford forward line is ex- '
pected to function as it should to
night, inasmuch as Coach Thornton
has spent almost two weeks in
grooming a fast offense.
The defense unit of Co-captains
"Wally Wiget and Bill Woodard, both
a 11-conference men last year, "Suds"
Sutherland, and Bob Haslacher can
be depended upon to bolster the line
very eqectively. And with Bob
Hoover, Bill Clemo, and Chuck Gif
fin leading the attack, Thornton has
little cause for worry.
No set-up, however, is the Ath
ens outfit. Denny Driggs, former
Cardinal water polo captain; Jim
McKay, California ace of several
years ago; and Gordon Corson,
ex-Oregon star and veteran of
many bay aquatic events, are in
cluded in the Club's starting line
up.
And with only a single week be
fore the first Californit tilt, it be
hooves the Indian team to sparkle
or else give the impression that
Stanford has come to the end of the
championship trail it has trod for 21
out of 22 years of water polo com
petition.
Frosh Seek Revenge
At 8:30 o'clock the yearling tank
poloists will meet the Athens re
serves in an attempt to hand the
Club men a bit of their own medi
cine. The frosh went down in defeat
against the Athenians at a time
when they had engaged in only five
practice sessions.
Following the freshman tilt, Roy
Winkleman, who last year was
accorded All-American Interscho
lastic honors in Pennsylvania, will
present a diving exhibition. The
Indian varsity-Athens Club game,
the main event, will close the pro
gram. Admission will be free.
Starting lineups for the varsity
tilt are as follows:
Stanford Athens Club
Hoover sprint Smith
Clemo forward McKay
Giffin forward Pederson
Wiget center back Corson
Woodard guard Driggs
Sutherland guard Kaiser
Haslacher goalie Davis

Two evenly matched water polo
squads, both of championship cali
ber, will clash at Encina pools at
8:30 o'clock tonight when Coach
Nort Thornton sends his Stanford
varsity into battle with the power
ful Athens Club team.
Ten days ago the Indians, A.A.U.
and Intercollegiate title holders
throughout the past 21 years, were
barely able to eke out a 3-2 win
over the Athenians.
Offense Stressed
The Stanford forward line is ex- '
pected to function as it should to
night, inasmuch as Coach Thornton
has spent almost two weeks in
grooming a fast offense.
The defense unit of Co-captains
"Wally Wiget and Bill Woodard, both
a 11-conference men last year, "Suds"
Sutherland, and Bob Haslacher can
be depended upon to bolster the line
very eqectively. And with Bob
Hoover, Bill Clemo, and Chuck Gif
fin leading the attack, Thornton has
little cause for worry.
No set-up, however, is the Ath
ens outfit. Denny Driggs, former
Cardinal water polo captain; Jim
McKay, California ace of several
years ago; and Gordon Corson,
ex-Oregon star and veteran of
many bay aquatic events, are in
cluded in the Club's starting line
up.
And with only a single week be
fore the first Californit tilt, it be
hooves the Indian team to sparkle
or else give the impression that
Stanford has come to the end of the
championship trail it has trod for 21
out of 22 years of water polo com
petition.
Frosh Seek Revenge
At 8:30 o'clock the yearling tank
poloists will meet the Athens re
serves in an attempt to hand the
Club men a bit of their own medi
cine. The frosh went down in defeat
against the Athenians at a time
when they had engaged in only five
practice sessions.
Following the freshman tilt, Roy
Winkleman, who last year was
accorded All-American Interscho
lastic honors in Pennsylvania, will
present a diving exhibition. The
Indian varsity-Athens Club game,
the main event, will close the pro
gram. Admission will be free.
Starting lineups for the varsity
tilt are as follows:
Stanford Athens Club
Hoover sprint Smith
Clemo forward McKay
Giffin forward Pederson
Wiget center back Corson
Woodard guard Driggs
Sutherland guard Kaiser
Haslacher goalie Davis
