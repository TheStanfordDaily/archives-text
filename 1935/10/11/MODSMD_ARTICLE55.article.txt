# Tractors Replace Mules in Warfare

### 
KANSAS CITY. Oct. 10 (/P).—The
sturdy American mule, familiar on
war fronts the world over, appar
ently is losing ground to truck and
tractor in the Italo-Ethiopian con
flict.
A survey of leading American
livestock markets indicated tonight
that Italy is buying only lightly—if
at all. There were no reports of
Ethiopian purchases.
