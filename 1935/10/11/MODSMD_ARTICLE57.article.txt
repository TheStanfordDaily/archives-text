INDIANS REALLY
OPEN TOMORROW
The big red machine opens its sea
son tomorrow.
That's wrong. Stanford played its
opener a whole two weeks ago
against San Jose State and has since
dropped the Dons of U.S.F.
But no, as far as the big red
machine, that Tiny Thornhill and
his cohorts originally expected to
see go blazing through the 1935
season to conference honors, is
concerned—well, we haven't seen
it really play a game yet.
In fact, we don't know very much i
about Stanford's football team this
yeai beyond the fact that the 1934
line is still okay and there are a
lot of mighty good halfbacks 'on the
roster.
Ask Tiny how good the Indians
are. He'll say he doesn't know, that
he hasn't had a chance to really see
the team intact against an opponent
this year. And Husky Hunt, Ernie
Nevers, and Jim Lawson will say the i
same.
What about that first half against
San Jose State. They were all there
then—Grayson, Paulman, Alustiza,
Hamilton, and the No. 1 line. Yes,
they were there all right, but so
were scores of San Jose men strain
ing through the sieve-like line. We
couldn't see the backfield of our
big i'ed machine for purple and gold
jerseys.
That one, short, pitiful half, the
only time we've seen the first
string backfield behind the first
string line this season, didn't tell
us very much.
So tomorrow the big red machine
really opens its season. The line has
the feel of the turf by now, the back
field men are over their injuries—
everything is set for the start that
should have been made two weeks
ago.
UCLANS HAVE
FIGHT, BUT—
U.C.L.A. will put a fine team on
the grid tomorrow. If fight and the
will to win were all the require
ments to annex the ball game the
Bruins might walk off the stadium
field victorious. But it will take
more than those qualities to beat
Stanford.
Time, they have a Chuck Cheshire
who's ranked as one of the fastest in
togs. But the rest of those backs
aren't the speed demon type. They'd
rather drive into the line on power.
That's the field they'll stress to
morrow — line bucks and tackle
slants—iF they follow somewhat the
same tactics they used to gain 260
yards against O.S.C.
But there's something about the
weight and ability of Stanford's
little forward wall that leads us
to believe the Uclans will expe
rience some trouble finding holes
to run through.
U.C.L.A. should be out-punted,
too. Coach Bill Spaulding has yet to
find a top-notch kicker, though Mr.
Cheshire and Fred Funk have abil
ity. But against such men as Paul
man, Hamilton, Alustiza, and Col
lins they might find difficulty. Tex
Key handles his placement kicking
toe well, though.
The pass defense is none too
strong—Stanford might not be in a
position to talk here—and that may
be a serious lack against the In
dians' fast developing aerial game.
But in passing, kicking, and
tackling the Bruins are said to be
strong. And there are stories of
an almost-too-perfect smoothness
of offense.
However, all in all, Stanford will
beat U.C.L.A. tomorrow. Yes, that's
a pretty strong statement all right,
but this is one case where we'll risk
misstatement.
For if we're wrong, there will be
the future of the big red machine to
worry about, and not a few mis
spoken words. —Frost

same.
What about that first half against
San Jose State. They were all there
then—Grayson, Paulman, Alustiza,
Hamilton, and the No. 1 line. Yes,
they were there all right, but so
were scores of San Jose men strain
ing through the sieve-like line. We
couldn't see the backfield of our
big i'ed machine for purple and gold
jerseys.
That one, short, pitiful half, the
only time we've seen the first
string backfield behind the first
string line this season, didn't tell
us very much.
So tomorrow the big red machine
really opens its season. The line has
the feel of the turf by now, the back
field men are over their injuries—
everything is set for the start that
should have been made two weeks
ago.
UCLANS HAVE
FIGHT, BUT—
U.C.L.A. will put a fine team on
the grid tomorrow. If fight and the
will to win were all the require
ments to annex the ball game the
Bruins might walk off the stadium
field victorious. But it will take
more than those qualities to beat
Stanford.
Time, they have a Chuck Cheshire
who's ranked as one of the fastest in
togs. But the rest of those backs
aren't the speed demon type. They'd
rather drive into the line on power.
That's the field they'll stress to
morrow — line bucks and tackle
slants—iF they follow somewhat the
same tactics they used to gain 260
yards against O.S.C.
But there's something about the
weight and ability of Stanford's
little forward wall that leads us
to believe the Uclans will expe
rience some trouble finding holes
to run through.
U.C.L.A. should be out-punted,
too. Coach Bill Spaulding has yet to
find a top-notch kicker, though Mr.
Cheshire and Fred Funk have abil
ity. But against such men as Paul
man, Hamilton, Alustiza, and Col
lins they might find difficulty. Tex
Key handles his placement kicking
toe well, though.
The pass defense is none too
strong—Stanford might not be in a
position to talk here—and that may
be a serious lack against the In
dians' fast developing aerial game.
But in passing, kicking, and
tackling the Bruins are said to be
strong. And there are stories of
an almost-too-perfect smoothness
of offense.
However, all in all, Stanford will
beat U.C.L.A. tomorrow. Yes, that's
a pretty strong statement all right,
but this is one case where we'll risk
misstatement.
For if we're wrong, there will be
the future of the big red machine to
worry about, and not a few mis
spoken words. —Frost

OPEN TOMORROW
The big red machine opens its sea
son tomorrow.
That's wrong. Stanford played its
opener a whole two weeks ago
against San Jose State and has since
dropped the Dons of U.S.F.
But no, as far as the big red
machine, that Tiny Thornhill and
his cohorts originally expected to
see go blazing through the 1935
season to conference honors, is
concerned—well, we haven't seen
it really play a game yet.
In fact, we don't know very much i
about Stanford's football team this
yeai beyond the fact that the 1934
line is still okay and there are a
lot of mighty good halfbacks 'on the
roster.
Ask Tiny how good the Indians
are. He'll say he doesn't know, that
he hasn't had a chance to really see
the team intact against an opponent
this year. And Husky Hunt, Ernie
Nevers, and Jim Lawson will say the i
same.
