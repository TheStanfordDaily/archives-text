# Frosh Gridmen To Meet Menlo J.C. Tomorrow
## 
### 
While Coach Jimmy Bradshaw
and his frosh gridders prepared to
meet Menlo Junior College tomor
row, Assistant Coach John Bunn
and his group of reserves worked
; in a corner of the field as a grim
reminder of the U.S.C. yearling
| game next week. The Menlo affair
j starts at 12 o'clock.
With two left halfbacks on the
injured list, neither Hank Huebel
nor Louis Veenker will see action.
Bradshaw shifted Henryi Glasser
from quarter and he will start to
morrow. Pete Fay will back him
up.
Since Menlo probably won't be
dangerous, the frosh coaches will
have an opportunity to try out such
men as Ted Noll and Hal Saunders,
1 ends; A1 Alustiza, Ken Jordan, and
| Vein Maino, backs; Tony Mecia,
i center, and others.
j While the Menlo eleven may not
j penetrate the frosh line, it may toss
I enough passes to cause trouble; but
| in the Sacramento J.C. game last
week the Papooses showed to good
advantage in pass defense. In this
department Dick Sutton, Bill Kii-sch
and a fast charging line should make
1 a good defense against any kind of
. air raid.

Thirty thousand germs are ex
| changed every time a kiss is com
i pleted.
