# Upsets May Mark Coast Grid Games
## Trojans-Illinois, Bears vs. Oregon, Gaels-Pacific Feature Battles 
### Bob Leland 
Headed by the intersectional
classic between the once mighty !
Trojans and wily Bob Zuppke's Illi- ;
nois U. team, coast football enters j
its third week tomorrow.
It should he an eventful week,
with lots of chance for upsets. In the
first place, Illinois is very likely to
plaster the coast with its first inter
sectional defeat of the 1935 season,
but Howard Jones' men have a j
mighty fine chance to redeem them- i
selves- in the eyes of the fooLball j
world.
Up north, Stub Allison's Golden |
Bear gridders engage Oregon
University in one of the three im
portant conference games. Prink
Callison has a good team, hut no
I
one would he rash enough to pre
dict an upset here. The Bears pack
too much in the way of lethal
weapons.
The second northern team to en
gage a conference rival is Washing
ton State. The Cougars have their
best team in years and should
breeze through Doug Fessenden's
Montana boys, though the team that
held U.S.C. to a 9-0 score in the sea
son opener may give Babe Holling
bery a bad time for a while.
Now we come to the- chances for
upsets. First of all, Amos Alonzo
Stagg leads his College of the Pacific
Bengals into battle with the so
called marauding Moragans from St.
Mary's. The Gaels may not be in
the best mental condition after last
Saturday's fracas with California.
Down at Fresno, Clipper Smith
will get a real test from Leo Harris
and his Fresno Bulldogs. The
Raisin City team is reputedly the
best eleven in the Far Western
Conference, which includes Ne
vada and College of the Pacific. At
any rate, they have a fine aggre
gation, and the same mental con
dition, as well as physical in this
case, may go a long way toward
giving them tile jump on the
Bronco.
Up in Reno, Spud Lewis will at
tempt to break his losing streak of
two games while playing the Nevada
Wolves, but here again a tough game
the week previous may be enough
to give the Wolves a shade over the
Dons. Nevada is always hard to
beat at home.
Washington's Huskies have a week
of rest after their conquest of Santa
Clara, and before their game with
Washington State next week.
