### 
Sylvestre X. Drofnats, sole own
er of his name, gazed into his crystal
bowl for a long time last night, be
fore he would hazard a guess on the
results of tomorrow's games.
"My class average prediction last
year kind of set the boys back on
their ears. And the kiddies are all
my ardent fannies. Isn't that dan
dy?"
After gazing for a while, Syl
vestre threads among the goals,
pulls out sevex - al remarkable pre
dictions and two goldfish. "I don't
like their table manners," says the
sneery seer.
The Stanford team, yclept the In
diannies, will set the UCLAlyptus
boys upon their ears, which are not
dry.
The score at the end of the ninth
inning will be 17-0 â€”just an outing
for the Injuns.
The rest of the calamities are:
Cal 21, Oregon 0; St. Mary's 24, Col
lege of Pacifists 7; Santa Clara 27,
Fresnatch 0; Wash. State 24, Mon
tana 0; U.S.C. 6, Adenois 7; U.S.F.
12, Nevada 6.
