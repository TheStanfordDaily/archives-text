Word came from the War Depart- ,
ment in Washington this week that
Captain S. M. Miller of the Stanford
R. O. T. C. had been promoted to the
rank of major. Major Miller was
transferred to the Farm unit in 1930 1
from Fort Meyer, Virginia.
In the military science department,
Major Miller teaches advanced mili- !
tary courses. At the R.O.T.C. unit j
he instructs student soldiers in
equitation. j
