# "Let the Winds of Freedom Blow"
## Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily Member of the Associated Press Importance of Unhampered Education Wisely Stressed at Big Annual Meet 
### 
In New York's Waldorf-Astoria last night,
the largest collection of prominent Stanford
alumni ever assembled heard addresses from
live men, including Stanford's No. 1 alumnus
Herbert Hoover and President of the Univer
sity Hay Lyman Wilbur.
Sponsored bv Stanford Associates, the
theme of the meeting was "The University of
I lie Future." For the nation, Invest news of
the evening was Mr. Hoover's spccch in which
be stressed the menace to endowed institu
tions presented by financial policies and in
flationism. I'or the scientifically minded, of
interest was Mr. Wilbur's forward-looking,
logically constructed speech on "Biology in
the University of Tomorrow."
Behind Hoover's speech was little political
connotation, but much cold, hard fact. That
the ex-President feels colleges have a real
place in the life and progress of this nation
was obvious from bis remarks. Further, he
stressed the especial place of privately en
dowed schools in maintaining freedom of
research and exploration in new fields of life
and thought.
II redistribution of wealth is coining, it can
be placed nowhere more advantageously to the
people as a whole than in educational insti
tutions, his listeners were reminded. Refresh
ing waters of freedom must spring from them.

he said, for in them "the nation holds that
link of the past to the vision of the future
which supports all civilization."
Skipping all financial aspects and fears for
the future of endowed institutions, Dr. Wil
bur's speech supplemented that of his fellow
alumnus. The place of the university in the
future of mankind lies in understanding and
furthering its biological basis, the only way
in which true and long-term progress can be
made.
Commenting that democracy is the world's
greatest experiment today, but that it is sub
ject to emotional and not intellectual control,
\\ ilbur pictured a great field for university
research in attempting to aid the race to
develop its brain and biological stock. The
field of eugenics has only been marginally
scratched, for example.
In some aspects the speech might even be
termed "radical," for marked shortcomings
in our present extent of progress were noted,
and Wilbur harks back to the first great radi
cal, Plato, in finding that development will lie
in the direction of better breeding and care
of our human stock.
All in all, it is inspiring to Stanford men to
see that Stanford is still in the van of the pro
gressives, looking and striving toward a bet
ter society to be reached by careful and en
lightened means.

All in all, it is inspiring to Stanford men to
see that Stanford is still in the van of the pro
gressives, looking and striving toward a bet
ter society to be reached by careful and en
lightened means.
In New York's Waldorf-Astoria last night,
the largest collection of prominent Stanford
alumni ever assembled heard addresses from
live men, including Stanford's No. 1 alumnus
Herbert Hoover and President of the Univer
sity Hay Lyman Wilbur.
Sponsored bv Stanford Associates, the
theme of the meeting was "The University of
I lie Future." For the nation, Invest news of
the evening was Mr. Hoover's spccch in which
be stressed the menace to endowed institu
tions presented by financial policies and in
flationism. I'or the scientifically minded, of
interest was Mr. Wilbur's forward-looking,
logically constructed speech on "Biology in
the University of Tomorrow."
Behind Hoover's speech was little political
connotation, but much cold, hard fact. That
the ex-President feels colleges have a real
place in the life and progress of this nation
was obvious from bis remarks. Further, he
stressed the especial place of privately en
dowed schools in maintaining freedom of
research and exploration in new fields of life
and thought.
II redistribution of wealth is coining, it can
be placed nowhere more advantageously to the
people as a whole than in educational insti
tutions, his listeners were reminded. Refresh
ing waters of freedom must spring from them.

he said, for in them "the nation holds that
link of the past to the vision of the future
which supports all civilization."
Skipping all financial aspects and fears for
the future of endowed institutions, Dr. Wil
bur's speech supplemented that of his fellow
alumnus. The place of the university in the
future of mankind lies in understanding and
furthering its biological basis, the only way
in which true and long-term progress can be
made.
Commenting that democracy is the world's
greatest experiment today, but that it is sub
ject to emotional and not intellectual control,
\\ ilbur pictured a great field for university
research in attempting to aid the race to
develop its brain and biological stock. The
field of eugenics has only been marginally
scratched, for example.
In some aspects the speech might even be
termed "radical," for marked shortcomings
in our present extent of progress were noted,
and Wilbur harks back to the first great radi
cal, Plato, in finding that development will lie
in the direction of better breeding and care
of our human stock.
All in all, it is inspiring to Stanford men to
