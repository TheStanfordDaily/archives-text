# It's Still No Cinch To Stay on the Farm
## 
### 
A year ago, the scholarship committee de
cided to put t'pper Division men on their
own feel, and removed all flunkoul rules for
them. The committee went on the assumption
that anyone falling so far below ;i "C" average
as to make graduation impossible would have
sense enough to drop out of school, saving
time and money.
At th;d time students were disqualified from
school if in five years they did not get the "(1"
average requisite for entrance into the Upper
Division. Yesterday the scholarship commit
tee announced, along with other simplifica
tions in Lower Division tlunkoul rules, that
nine quarters will be the maximum allowed
for it student to make the grade into the Upper
Division. This was necessitated when the
five-year maximum failed to prove feasible.
First- and second-year requirements have
been little changed, although a marked stiffen
ing in the Ihirdy-vear rules is noticeable.
\\ bile the subject is on deck, mention of
Stanford's standards in general might not be
amiss. Humor has llown up and down the
coast, no doubt started by some of our friendly
rivals, that Stanford was slipping. It is not
so, assures Registrar Mitchell. By grade
points made, the Farm's position is the same.
Lnlranee requirements at Stanford have not
changed. The difference was that before the
depression, from those who could qualify only
the cream was selected, whereas, for one or
two depression years nearly all qualifying
were admitted.
Those days are now gone. Admittance to
new Lower Division women was closed in
May lor this quarter; for new Lower Division

men, on September 1. The next time someone
says Stanford is slipping, a referenee to the
record should he sufficient.
