Dear Hash:
Hello!
Very sincercly yours,

A mysterious figure slunked into the library a few
nights ago, and asked for a book. Suspicions aroused,
the clerk asked for the student body card of the appli
cant. The mysterious figure went through his pockets,
took out pencils, knives, erasers, papers, an intra
mural football, and a frosh bible, but could only pro
ciUce a registration certificate. The mysterious figure
was a Mr. Marvin R. Kahn, who was known about
these parts last year as a scholar and a gentleman and
dance committee chairman. (Who said our supreme
executive body isn't a song-and-dance committee?)
Our Hasher's H-men report that although the Dee
gees have a nice, new house, there are more flics and
Decges in the kitchen than last year. The screens
aren't up yet.
A head in the Daily Californian announced that
the failure of an electric switch plunged the campus
into darkness, although the accident occurrcd at 8
o clock in the morning. The explanation is that switch
or no switch, Californians are always, completely, to
tally in the dark, in the fog, and at C.
Because of a few of Our Hasher's recent all-Uni
versity digs, several people have been wondering if
the hashing baby boy was getting sour on the work.
Let it be understood, howsomever, Our Hasher con
ducts no campaigns, except for the glory of Stanford
and in loving memory of the Assembly Hall. Our
Hasher loves everybody—yell leaders, Daily editors,
executives, Bull Session, Abe and Dave Mellinkoff,
the freshman women (careful), and particularly Our
Hasher, who is very funny.
From a believe it or not column in the Daily Trojan
we draw the startling news: "Do you know that Nick
Pappas (now first-string quarter) paid his own tuition
during his freshman year?" When a man bites a dog
