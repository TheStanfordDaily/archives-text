# Bull Session
## COME ON OUT, GIRLS! 
### 
Big . . . jovial Tiny Thornhill . . . again proves he
has a tender spot in his bosom for something besides
favorite halfbacks . . . And that something is usually
a coach's pet aversion . . . sweet femininity.
<! * * *
Does Tiny mind if his men go dating after practice
hours? Well, maybe. But he doe.sn't mind if those
prospective dates drape themselves along the side
lines during turn-outs. Instead of scowling on such a
thing, he has invited it—last week and again Tuesday.
* * * *
There's something resembling strategy in these
invitations of '.liny's. That, women and football don't
mix is an axiom players learn in their prep school
days. Blondes huddled around the tackling dummy,
skirts swishing along the side-lines, silken shapelies
crossed under the very noses of pass receivers. That,
we know from experience, is highly distracting to say
the very least. The Stanford coach must be experi
menting.
* 4> * *
Presumptiously we consider Tiny's reasoning:
Women in football players' lives—inevitable. Trying
to keep women out of players' lives—impossible. Put
ting the ban on women during grid season—unsuccess
ful. Long practices keep players away from feminine
wiles—improbable. Closing practice gates to anyone—
unjustifiable. Letting the girls see their "heroes" in
daily action—charitable. Women on the sidelines an
added incentive for hard work—possible. Using prac
tice as class-room for teaching women football funda
mentals—commendable. Good reasons for not letting
women watch turn-outs—lacking.
* * * *
So Tiny sets a new standard. Tuesday was "Stu
dents' Day'' inside the drab, green fence of the practice
field. And there were women there. More such occa
sions will be held from week to week. Who knows,
it may turn into another Stanford tradition. And up
and down the coast they'll say, "Why down there at
Stanford the women all go out and watch the football
team practice."

just can t wait to see that big, tall end catch those long
passes. And I'm sure I saw him looking at me yes

Does Tiny mind if his men go dating after practice
hours? Well, maybe. But he doe.sn't mind if those
prospective dates drape themselves along the side
lines during turn-outs. Instead of scowling on such a
thing, he has invited it—last week and again Tuesday.

There's something resembling strategy in these
invitations of '.liny's. That, women and football don't
mix is an axiom players learn in their prep school
days. Blondes huddled around the tackling dummy,
skirts swishing along the side-lines, silken shapelies
crossed under the very noses of pass receivers. That,
we know from experience, is highly distracting to say
the very least. The Stanford coach must be experi
menting.

Presumptiously we consider Tiny's reasoning:
Women in football players' lives—inevitable. Trying
to keep women out of players' lives—impossible. Put
ting the ban on women during grid season—unsuccess
ful. Long practices keep players away from feminine
wiles—improbable. Closing practice gates to anyone—
unjustifiable. Letting the girls see their "heroes" in
daily action—charitable. Women on the sidelines an
added incentive for hard work—possible. Using prac
tice as class-room for teaching women football funda
mentals—commendable. Good reasons for not letting
women watch turn-outs—lacking.

So Tiny sets a new standard. Tuesday was "Stu
dents' Day'' inside the drab, green fence of the practice
field. And there were women there. More such occa
sions will be held from week to week. Who knows,
it may turn into another Stanford tradition. And up
and down the coast they'll say, "Why down there at
Stanford the women all go out and watch the football
team practice."

just can t wait to see that big, tall end catch those long
passes. And I'm sure I saw him looking at me yes
terday." —John McClelland
