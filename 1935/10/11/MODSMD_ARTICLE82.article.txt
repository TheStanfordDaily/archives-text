# SAD STATE OF AFFAIRS
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
To a recent letter in Vox Campi
signed by "a senior which don't
i know his hymn," I would like to add
my support, as a soph who never
knew there was a hymn. This is a
sad state of affairs. The previously
mentioned mumbling was noticed at
; the San Jose State game as well as
the U.S.F. game in the singing of the
hymn.
May I make a suggestion? Bill
Shriner, yell leader at Cal, recently
conducted an inter-living-group
| singing contest for which a prize was
awarded to the group which knew
! the songs best and showed the best
spirit in singing them. This taught
Cal students their songs as well as
! building up the spirit 100 per cent.
Now I know that it would be a
, lowly thing for Stanford to adopt a
i U.C. brain-child, but the humiliation
' would be worth it if this campus
| could learn the hymn as well as the
I other songs.
A soph who never knew
there was a hymn
Stick around.—Ed.
