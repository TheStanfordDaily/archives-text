# DRIVEL-DISPENSERS— THAT'S US
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Here's one from a dissatisfied cus- '
tomer. It appears that The Daily j
has become a drivel-dispenser. To j
choose from among many examples
which would prove my point, I refer i
especially to a "Bull Session (shades j
of the MellinkofTs!") by one John i
McClelland. This worthy suffers not
Dr. Beard to come unto him; see
texts: the in-"famous Lusk report" j
arid "Who's Who in Radicalism."
If the Constitution were such a j
pillar of ageless granite as Mr. Mc-
Clelland ancf the Liberty League
seem to think, one might think that
a mite of adverse criticism would ;
not shatter the staunch stone. Ap- j
parently John's education up to now
has consisted of "pure soap."
Thus my bit of evidence that (he |
winds of freedom which blow
j through the columns would not ruf- ;
j fie the tail-feathers of a humming i
I bird.
Sincerely,
O. E. L. Schmidt
If everyone were of the same
point of view, what a dull world
this would be.—Kd.
