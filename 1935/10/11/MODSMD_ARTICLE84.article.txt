# SO-CALLED RADICALISM
## 
### 
, Ihe Editor, Sir:
Shades of Mellinkoff! What has
happened to the once liberal Bull
Session?
, McClelland would have Stanford
professors keep the noted historian
Chalies A. Beard off reading lists
because he is too "radical." He says
that Stanford professors «do live up
to the ideal of presenting all sides
; of any question as though he agreed
with that ideal. But is it possible to
find all sides in any one author? If
all authors who have definite ideas
i and express them were ruled out,
what kind would be left?
Lloyd E. Thomas
The difficulty: Beard's hook
seems to be THE required text.
