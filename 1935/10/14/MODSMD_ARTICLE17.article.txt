# Eccentric Frenchman's Tower Remains Puzzle
## 
### MARGARET LOUD 
Probably no other building on the
[Stanford campus is surrounded by
j more tradition and mystery than
| Frenchman's Tower, that old fort
i ress-like structure located on one of
i the back country roads of the
j Farm.
It was built about 1874 by M. Peter
Coutts, an eccentric Frenchman, as
! pari of his project to make a coun-
J try home which would rival the
! baronial estates of Europe. The
| tower was constructed to hold a
I tank which supplied water for the
| estate. However, much curiosity and
speculation were aroused as to its
purpose, its crennelated top and se
ries of loopholes leading to the be
lief that it was intended for a strong-
I hold or defense to be used if M.
I Coutts should ever be run down by
the French government, from which
! he was popularly supposed to be
; hiding.
Coutts had held the position of
j paymaster of the commissary de
partment of the French government

at the beginning of the Franco-
Prussian War. A shortage of $5,100,-
000 found in that department at the
time of his disappearance from
Fiance was attributed to him, though
the most diligent search on the part
of French officials failed to prove
that the two events were connected.
His guilt seems probable in view
of the fact that he took extreme care
never to let his picture, signature, or
any other trace of his real identity
escape. Carrying on his transac
tions in the name of his
governess, he spent fabulous sums
on his estate, business schemes, and
charities.
In 1882. Coutts and his family re
turned to France, from where he
sent instructions to his superintend
ent to sell the estate. Though the
Frenchman was never seen in this
country again, his brick tower still
remains a mute evidence of his ec
centricities and possible crime and
furnishes a fascinating legend to add
to Stanford stories.
