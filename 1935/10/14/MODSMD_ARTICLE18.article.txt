# Lutz Denies Likelihood Of General War
## History Professor Says United States Will Remain Neutral 
### Virginia Hawkes 
"Ever since the beginning of the !
present European crisis there has 1
been a danger of war. The outbreak
of a world conflict does not appear |
to be imminent," stated Dr. Ralph H. j
Lutz, professor of history and chair- i
man of the directors of the Hoover !
War library yesterday.
War Is Improbable
Dr. Lutz continued by . saying 1
"There appears to be little danger j
that the conflict between the league i
and Italy over the latter's penetra
tion of Ethiopia will lead to a gen
eral European war. Although it
would seem logical for the two cen
tral European dictatorships to come
to an agreement concerning terri
torial expansion, they are prevented
today as in 1933 from uniting by the [
Austrian question."
"In other words, northern terri
torial guaranties which are a matter
of lile and death to Italy cannot be
recognized by Nazi Germany."
"Moreover," he continued, "the
union of the league powers today
which includes England, France,
Russia, and the Little Entente
represents a certain guarantee that
the "iron dice" will not be rolled
in the immediate future."
As for the possible entrance of the
United States into another world
war, Dr. Lutz said, "It is my opinion
that the United States will not be
involved in another world war as a
result of the invocation of sanctions
of the league against Italy."
Disagrees with Goslin
"I do not agree with R. A. Gos
lin's interpretation of 'War Tomor
iow, Will We Keep Out.' This at
tempt to explain how we got into
the last war appears to be an over
simplification of our complicated
position as a neutral between 1914
and 1917."
He further pointed out, "The
publication of the fifth volume of
Baker's 'Woodrow Wilson,' which
has just been announced, will, I
believe, be a convincing reply to
these latest attacks upon the for
eign policy of Woodrow Wilson."
Dr. Lutz pointed out that Univer
sity students today in observing the
present crisis will have an opportu
nity to observe war-time propaganda
at its best and especially one or two
new techniques in this line of battle.
They will also be able to observe
that unfortunately secret diplomacy
is playing as important a part in the
proceedings today, 1935, as it did in
1914.
Treaties Bring Crisis
"In fact, the present crisis began
with the secret armament of Ger
many, followed by the secret agree
ments between Laval and Mussolini
in January of 1935 and of France and
Russia in the following spring. Now
behind the scenes at Geneva we see
the effect of British secret diplo
macy."
As for the old question that the
weight of opinion in the western
world is that another world war
would mark the beginnings of the
decline of the present civilization,
Dr. Lutz pointed out: "Americans
j are prone to forget that whether
I belligerent or neutral we would
' decline also."

Disagrees with Goslin
"I do not agree with R. A. Gos
lin's interpretation of 'War Tomor
iow, Will We Keep Out.' This at
tempt to explain how we got into
the last war appears to be an over
simplification of our complicated
position as a neutral between 1914
and 1917."
He further pointed out, "The
publication of the fifth volume of
Baker's 'Woodrow Wilson,' which
has just been announced, will, I
believe, be a convincing reply to
these latest attacks upon the for
eign policy of Woodrow Wilson."
Dr. Lutz pointed out that Univer
sity students today in observing the
present crisis will have an opportu
nity to observe war-time propaganda
at its best and especially one or two
new techniques in this line of battle.
They will also be able to observe
that unfortunately secret diplomacy
is playing as important a part in the
proceedings today, 1935, as it did in
1914.
Treaties Bring Crisis
"In fact, the present crisis began
with the secret armament of Ger
many, followed by the secret agree
ments between Laval and Mussolini
in January of 1935 and of France and
Russia in the following spring. Now
behind the scenes at Geneva we see
the effect of British secret diplo
macy."
As for the old question that the
weight of opinion in the western
world is that another world war
would mark the beginnings of the
decline of the present civilization,
Dr. Lutz pointed out: "Americans
j are prone to forget that whether
I belligerent or neutral we would
' decline also."
"Ever since the beginning of the !
present European crisis there has 1
been a danger of war. The outbreak
of a world conflict does not appear |
to be imminent," stated Dr. Ralph H. j
Lutz, professor of history and chair- i
man of the directors of the Hoover !
War library yesterday.
War Is Improbable
Dr. Lutz continued by . saying 1
"There appears to be little danger j
that the conflict between the league i
and Italy over the latter's penetra
tion of Ethiopia will lead to a gen
eral European war. Although it
would seem logical for the two cen
tral European dictatorships to come
to an agreement concerning terri
torial expansion, they are prevented
today as in 1933 from uniting by the [
Austrian question."
"In other words, northern terri
torial guaranties which are a matter
of lile and death to Italy cannot be
recognized by Nazi Germany."
"Moreover," he continued, "the
union of the league powers today
which includes England, France,
Russia, and the Little Entente
represents a certain guarantee that
the "iron dice" will not be rolled
in the immediate future."
As for the possible entrance of the
United States into another world
war, Dr. Lutz said, "It is my opinion
that the United States will not be
involved in another world war as a
result of the invocation of sanctions
of the league against Italy."
