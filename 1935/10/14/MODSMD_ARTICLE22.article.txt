## War in East Threatened By Fatal Skirmish 
### 
MOSCOW, Oct. 13 (/P). — Soviet i
Russia today directed a "resolute"
protest to the Japanese government
against a reported new invasion of
the Soviet frontier, in which both
Russian guards and members of a
Japanese-Manchukuati detachment
were slain last night.
The government ordered its Am
bassador at Tokyo to make the pro
test and at the same time proposed
that a mixed commission be ap- !
pointed to investigate on the spot.
Japs Attack
As reported here, a Japanese-
Manchukuan detachment, about 50
strong, crossed the Russian border
at Grodekovo (near Khabarovsk in
Southeastern Siberia, 500 miles
north of Vladivostok) and pene
trated into Soviet territory nearly a
mile.
The detachment "opened fire on
the Soviet guard patrol, consisting
of two mounted frontier guards,"
said an official press announcement.
Soviets Helped
"Then two other Soviet patrols,
which were approximately 2V-z kilo
meters from the Japanese - Man
churian dctachment and numbering
altogether 18 men, hastened to the
assistance of the first patrol.
"The Japanese-Manchurian de
tachment opened fire with a ma
chine gun on the Soviet patrol, and
in order to mask itself, set fire to
Ihe grass, the smoke from which
covered it, and moved in the direc
tion of the Soviet frontier patrol.
Many Die
"As a result of the firing that arose
there are dead and wounded among
the Soviet guards, and also, accord
ing to information received, on the
Japanese-Manchurian side."
Previously protests had been
lodged with the Japanese and Man
chukuo governments on border
j crossing reported in the same area
I on October 6 and 8.
Previous Invasions
In the first of these invasions the
! Soviet government charged that 20
j Manchukuans, under a Japanese of-»
j ficer, opened fire on Russian fron
; tier guards. On October 8, it was
1 contended, the invading force num
bered 50, but no fighting was men
tioned.
Numerous other incidents have
j occurred on the border in the last
j few months.
The ambushing of a Soviet border
patrol on Soviet territory by a Japa
nese-Manchukuan force, and the al
leged incursion by a Japanese-Man
chukuan squadron of river gun
i boats into Soviet waters led to pro-
I tests last July.
