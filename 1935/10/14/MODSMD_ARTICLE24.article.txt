## Fascists Claim Control Of Tigre Province After 11 Days of War Fighting Has Lulled Duce Plans Price Fixing To Control Living Cost

ROME, Oct. 13 (IP). â€”Benito Mus
solini's war without a real battle
strengthened hopes in high quar
ters tonight for a relatively peaceful
settlement, an authoritative person
age told the Associated Press:
"By the end of October I believe
there can be useful conversations."
War with Ethiopia was only in its
eleventh day, with four days of
moderate fighting, but Italy already
felt herself mistress of the whole
Tigre province.
Planes Hunt Ethiopians
Italian planes scoured the skies,
apparently finding nowhere an
Ethiopian army that could furnish
the "real battle" in which Italians
expected to prove their strength.
Complete conquest of Ethiopia is
II Duce's program. But there were
many indications tonight that some
thing less will satisfy him.
In official circlcs the usual sug
gestion was that Italy must have
a protectorate over the four old
provinces of ancient Ethiopia and
full possession of the remainder.
Fascism, meantime, got ready to
put the brakes on increases in the
cost of living at home and to impose
sanctions of its own on speculators.
Achille Starace, secretary of the
Fascist party, sent orders through
out the country for a price control
system.
Hoarding Feared
Slight advances in prices shown
by the latest official statistics were
balanced by many deci'eases. Never
theless, officials anticipated efforts of
panicky persons to hoard supplies.
The cost of living increased, ac
cording to official figures, 1-5 to 1
per cent from August to Septem
ber. The imminence of League of
Nations' economic sanctions caus
ed rumors of new increases, but
no statistics were available to con
firm them.
