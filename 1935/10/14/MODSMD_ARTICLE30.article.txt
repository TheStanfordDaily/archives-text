Intramural football swings into its
second week today with four teams
which have yet to play a 1935 league
game meeting four outfits which
went through the mill last week.
Two of the latter quartet came out
on , top, but the other two went
down to defeat. Largely because of
their 19 to 7 victory over the A.K.L.s
Thursday, the Sigma Nus are slight
favorites over Sequoia I. El Cuadro
defeated the Japanese Club, 6 to 0,
Wednesday, but will have a far
tougher time with the Phi Delts
today.
Protest Mars Game
Conquered last week by the Dekes,
13 to 0, the Delts are short-enders
against El Capitan this afternoon. In
spite of being the fourth "experi
enced" team, the D.U.s, who took a
24-0 lacing from the Phi Sigs, will
probably lose again today, this time
to the Alpha Delts.
The closest of Friday's games was
marred by a protest. In its 13-0
triumph over the Breakers, the Med
ical School used Kenny Afflerbaugh,
Card varsity star of three or four
years ago. This is against a league
rule; so the Breakers demanded that
the game be replayed. It will be, at
the close of the regular season.

Hereafter, all teams which play
ineligible men must forfeit the
games in which such men are used.
All varsity lettermen and all men
having earned frosh numerals in
1934 are ineligible this season. Those
having won frosh numerals in 1933
and all preceding years may play,
however.
Sports Manager Stars
Led by Bill Newsom, who tossed
three touchdown passes, and Lee
Irelan, who caught one of them and
made three other scores, one on a
102-yard run after intercepting a
pass, the Fijis smothered El Capitan,
Friday, 39 to 0.
Giff Myers, mural sports manager,
starred for Chi Psi I in its 19 to 0
win over the K.A.s. Myers blocked
a rival punt for one touchdown, and
caught passes from Ed Littlefield for
the other two. The Stanford Fire
house forfeited to Theta Xi in the
fourth game scheduled for Friday.
