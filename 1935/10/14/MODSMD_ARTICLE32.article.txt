# Card Defeat Is Only Big Upset
## Other Coast Grid Teams Take Unexpected Wins 
### 
Leading teams on the Pacific
Coast had little trouble in winning
their games Saturday, and dopesters
spent a happy Saturday night. The
only major upset happened in Palo
Alto right off Highway 101.
California, playing Prink Calli
son's strong Oregons in a Portland
mud, looked especially good in
handing the northern eleven a G-0
loss.
Held to mediocrity in (he first
half, Floyd Blower took charge
late in the third (juarter and su
pervised a 62-yard march to the
Oregon goal. Here they were stop
ped, but only for a moment, and
the score came when Larry Lutz
blocked a Webfoot punt, and let
Ken Cotton make the score.
Blower, Cotton, and Sam Chap
man looked best in Cal's backfield;
big Larry Lutz at tackle and soph
Bob Herwig at roving center were
aces in the line.
Blower, playing ball this year
without medical consent, rang up a
6.33 yards per play behind a charg
ing Bear line.
Coach Jimmy Phelan's reputed
Husky powerhouses rested Satur
day in Seattle, looked forward to the
coming October 28 einbroglio with
the Cards.
Santa Clara had little trouble
in downing Fresno State, 24-0.
Frisky Kalisky frisked frivolously
as he pleased behind a hard
blocking line, and Flash Falaschi
and the other Broncs held the
Bulldogs to a mere yapping-at
heels, tame brand of ball.
Next week there will be a great
ball game when the Broncs meet the
Bears in Berkeley, and another at
Pullman with Washington up against
W.S.C.
The Cougars, led by Ed Gor
dard, Saturday whipped Montana by
a 13-7 scoreâ€”not too good, but the
Grizzlies proved not quite so stub
born as the Bruins.
S.C. took a trimming from Illi
nois. the team coached by the old
fox, Bob Zuppke. Troy couldn't
follow the Illini razzle-dazzle
close enough and fell, 19-0.
Troy meets Oregon State next
week, U.C. the next, and entertains
Stanford on the big homecoming
week-end, November 9.
U.S.F., despite a dozen football
ers on the injured list, had too much
for Nevada's Wolves, drubbing
them 27-7.
St. Mary's came back after their
10-0 licking at the hands of Cal last
week and routed A. A. Stagg's Col
lege of Pacificists 33-0.
Coast Conference's Idaho lost to
Whitman (Walla Walla), 0-7.
