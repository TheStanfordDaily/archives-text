# Yearling Air Raid Defeats Menlo, 40-0
## De Witt's Passes Bewilder Jaysee in Prologue To Uclan Game 
### Bob Leland 
Unleashing a passing attack that
clicked like a million, the Stanford
Frosh smothered Menlo Junior Col
lege 40-0 Saturday.
Passes figured in every touchdown
but the last, which was made in the
waning minutes of the game by sec
ond and third stringers.
Taking a punt on their own 40-
yurd stripe, the Papooses marched
to a score in five plays. VVally
deWitt passed to Walt Hege for
15, Bill Kirsch added !) and Kd
Gamier 2. DeWitt again passed,
this time to Gamier for 14, and
Kirsch dashed off tackle for 22
yards and the touchdown. Gamier
added the extra point.
The second score came a few min
utes later when Dave Carnahan
blocked a Menlo punt. DeWitt
laded back and flipped a pass to
Pete Zagar for the score. Gamier
again converted.
After a scoreless second period,
the frosh went to work. DeWitt
flung passes to Kirsch for 8 to 15
yards, smacked the line and then
reversed to Kirsch for the score.
The fourth score came on a
single thrust from the 25-yard
line after a poor Menlo kick. De-
Witt again tossed and Hawkins
tucked the leather under his arm
and crossed the goal untouched.
Later in the fourth period fol
lowing an interception of a Menlo
aerial thrust, Glasser passed to Don
Butler for 31 yards and a touch
down. Gamier converted to make
the score 33-0.
With the reserves in the game, the
Papooses intercepted a desperate
Menlo pass. A1 Alustiza and Ken
Jordan smacked the line. Follow
ing an offside penalty on Menlo,
Alustiza went over from the 1 yard
line.
Certainly the highly improved
play of the Card Babes bodes no
good for the Troy frosh next week.
To show how determined the frosh
coaches are to dump the Trobabes,
it is interesting to note that dur
ing the week before the Menlo
contest, nothing was done except
in preparation for U.S.C.
The starting line-up for the Menlo
game was: Hege and Hawkins, ends;
Carnahan and Zagar, tackles; Mc-
Millan and Shreve, guards; Sutton,
center; Gamier, quarterback; Glass
er and Kirsch, halfbacks; deWitt,
fullback.

After a scoreless second period,
the frosh went to work. DeWitt
flung passes to Kirsch for 8 to 15
yards, smacked the line and then
reversed to Kirsch for the score.
The fourth score came on a
single thrust from the 25-yard
line after a poor Menlo kick. De-
Witt again tossed and Hawkins
tucked the leather under his arm
and crossed the goal untouched.
Later in the fourth period fol
lowing an interception of a Menlo
aerial thrust, Glasser passed to Don
Butler for 31 yards and a touch
down. Gamier converted to make
the score 33-0.
With the reserves in the game, the
Papooses intercepted a desperate
Menlo pass. A1 Alustiza and Ken
Jordan smacked the line. Follow
ing an offside penalty on Menlo,
Alustiza went over from the 1 yard
line.
Certainly the highly improved
play of the Card Babes bodes no
good for the Troy frosh next week.
To show how determined the frosh
coaches are to dump the Trobabes,
it is interesting to note that dur
ing the week before the Menlo
contest, nothing was done except
in preparation for U.S.C.

Unleashing a passing attack that
clicked like a million, the Stanford
Frosh smothered Menlo Junior Col
lege 40-0 Saturday.

but the last, which was made in the
waning minutes of the game by sec
ond and third stringers.
Taking a punt on their own 40-
yurd stripe, the Papooses marched
to a score in five plays. VVally

15, Bill Kirsch added !) and Kd
Gamier 2. DeWitt again passed,
this time to Gamier for 14, and
Kirsch dashed off tackle for 22
