# Bruin Victory Fails To Down Rose Bowl Hopes for Stanford
## Chance for Rose Bowl Invitation Dimmed, But Not Lost 
### Gordon Frost 
"It's no Rose Bowl for as" —
"Stanford's through" — "Football
cughta be a minor sport" — "What
rotten breaks." That's the way a
large percentage of the week-end's
football conversation has been run
ning following the U.C.L.A. affair
of Saturday afternoon.
Shucks, you'd think Stanford had
lost the Big Game. But a closer look
indicates a slightly less serious sit
uation.
For after all, if the Indians lose
another hall game this season, last
Saturday's slump won't matter.
And if they don't lose another
game the Uclan defeat still won't
necessarily keep the big red ma
chine out of the Rose Bowl.
Sure, Stanford lost the first con
ference game of the season but only
the score indicates that there was a
loss. Look at these statistics: Stan
ford yards gained from scrimmage
—205; U.C.L.A.—75; Stanford first
downs—l 6; U.C.L.A. —2.
The big red machine is* still the
biggest on the coast despite the
fact that an inspired Bruin team
beat it by one point.
And about that Rose Bowl. Stan
ford isn't completely stymied by any
means. If the Indian gets the lucky
breaks in coming games that he lost
last Saturday, he still may be there
on New Year's.
First of all, Mr. Claude E. "Tiny"
Thorn hill's charges will have to
win the next four games with
Washington, Santa Clara, U.S.C.,
and Montana. They would have
had to do that anyway.
Then next they'll have to hope that
the Bears of Berkeley drop the Bears
of Westwood. That's not impossible.
And finally they meet the Univer
sity of California in the Stanford
Stadium on November 23 and deal
the final blow which puts them on
top of the Conference.
Yes, there are some "ifs" and
"huts" to the proposition hut the
chance that U.C.L.A. will go un
defeated aren't too strong and the
chances are good that Stanford
will, for the remainder of the sea
son.
The big red machine showed its
mettle Saturday. It showed 205
yards worth of drive against a
mighty stubborn defense. There were
faults. They will be remedied.
Stanford needed to lose a game
just to see what it feels like. Now
she knows. And chances are that the
same thing won't happen again, un
less lady luck completely turns her
back on the Indian.
