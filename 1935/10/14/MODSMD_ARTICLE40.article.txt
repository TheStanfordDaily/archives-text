"They out-rallied us at every
point," said Phil Coghloose, slave
and screw driver of the Rally Com
mittee. "We would have had the
game on ice, but the Uclans were too
hot for us.
"It's all a question of rooters'
hats," said Coghloose. "Statistics
proved that half our rooters were
rooting in unofficial hats. This
gave an unofficial tone to our
yells, which caused the officials to
give us officious penalties at in
auficious moments."
"The Phi Delt rushing chairman
was trying to signal one of the play
ers on the field by turning up the
wrong colored cards during the card
stunts. This caused the player to
rush in and try to pin the button on
the U.C.L.A. center, who counter
charged by trying to hang one on
him. Score: 7-6."
Joe Boodle Whoodle, Westwood
Rally Committeeman, said in a
signed interview with your very
own Daily Reporter: "Your rooters
played a clean, fast game. They
showed lots of fight during the half.
But we had Joe E. Brown for our
hidden ball play."
In response Coghloose said, "Our
boys fought hard, and I've noth
ing to say, nothing to say. And
don't forget the A.S.S.U. dance in
the women's gym."

I wishes to report that, except for
j guessing wrong on the U.C.L.A.
game, which was played in the Stan
ford Stadium sometime over the
week-end by agencies of the San
Francisco Community Chest, and
coming to you through the coux*tesy
| of the Stanford Board of Athletic
i Control, that peer-dinger sports pre
dicter Sylversmith Drofnats got 100
per cent on his predictions, coming
j as close as three points on the Santa
I Clara-Fresno fracas, and very close
| to the S.C.-Illinois whackas, which
is very close.
