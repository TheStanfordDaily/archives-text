# Rain-drenched Field Halts Polo Practice
## 
### 
Pblo practice scrimmage sched
uled for last Friday has been called
off indefinitely as a result of last
week's untimely drizzles. The wet
playing ground was deemed too
[ hazardous for the inexperienced re
) mount ponies.
I Captain H. Y. Grubbs expects,
however, to resume practice this
week, when the field dries. When
| asked how the malleteers were
rounding into shape, he voiced his
opinion: "In last Wednesday's prac
tice tilt the boys seemed to be
! grasping the game quickly. I expect
we'll soon start our official league
' games."
