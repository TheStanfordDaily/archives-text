JOCROMOL DIDN'T FAIL
BOBBY, ANYWAY
There was a little pink elephant
—and eleven mighty desperate foot
ball players struggling for Stanford
during that last half Sattarday.
The little elephant did his best.
I He and his master reeled off more
! yards than the whole opposition, but
it wasn't quite enough. Stanford
! lost, but Jockomol didn't let his boss
down.
Jockomol, just a little glass ele
phant less than an inch high, is
Bobby Grayson's good luck charm
and if his presence ever boosted
Bobby, it was yesterday.
'Way back in high school grid
days Grayson started carrying Jock
i taped in the top of his helmet. And
i right into college ball and the all—
| American rating they went together.
! Two weeks ago when Stanford met
1 San Jose State, Bobby forgot his
charm. He went on the field with
out the little fellow. And he came
| out before the half with an ankle
! that threatened to keep him on the
I sidelines for weeks.
j But Jockomol wasn't mad.
j When Bobby taped him back in
the roof of his "hat" before that
; affair last Saturday, they had an
agreement that everything was
okay, and they'd start going places
! together.
! They did. If ever Bobby Grayson
| looked all-Amei'ican, it was in that
, game. Yards and yards they went,
| 116 all told, for an average of 5.1
yards every try.
A GROUND GAINER
THIS NO. 20
There was one play that gained
every time and they used it again
and again, and might have even
run it more had not Bobby's position
at the signal calling post demanded
that he not call his own plays too
often.
To the team it's No. 20. To the
I stands it's Grayson fading back as
if to pass, and then cutting like a
lightning streak inside of the end.
Bobby so far is the only man on
the Stanford team who can make it
work in tough competition and it's
rapidly becoming known as the
"Grayson play."
Freddie Williams, however, has
I given evidence that with more ex
! perience on the No. 20, he too might
' have the speed to make that partic
ular play work. But until then it
will be "Grayson on a fade back
through left tackle . . ."

And if Jockomol and Bobby
keep going like they did on that
ill-fated Saturday two days ago,
Stanford's ail-American fullback
will repeat bis honors this year.
And we might even buy u bushel
of pink elephants and plaster them
in the top of every Stanford helmet.
