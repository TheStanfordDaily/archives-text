## Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily Member of the Associated Press Farm's Pledge Week Eliminates Cry That Greeks' Tactics Are 'Uncivilized' 
### 
While two major "kick - backs" at Hell
Week practices among University of Cali
fornia fraternities in the past month have
prompted Berkeley oilicials to commence for
mulation of plans for milder pre-initiations,
Stanford watches her twenty-four Creek-let
ter organizations go about a more civilized
process of initiating their neophytes into sa
cred brotherhood.
A genuine shudder passed up and down
California's Kow four weeks ago when a near
fatality resulted from over - exuberant Hell
Week practices. Berkeley Creeks were given
another set-back last Wednesday when live
pledges, attempting to fulfill a "quest," were
arraigned in police court on theft counts.
A few of Stanford's houses in the meantime
have held their initiations and attendant
Pledge Week activities; others look forward
to an entirely within-thc-housc pre-initiation
period sometime during the next few weeks.
To date, no violations of the resolution ban
ning Hell Week, which was approved by every
Stanford fraternity last spring, have been re
ported to the Interfraternity Board. The
spirit of the resolution was in the nature of a
"gentlemen's agreement," and it was not in
tended as a hard and fast law, enforcible by
certain definite penalties.
Although the agreement leaves much of the
enforcement and judgment to each individual
house, it firmly denounces two former Hell
Week practices: first, practices that are in

jurious to the initiate in health and scholar
ship; second, practices that are harmful to
the prestige of Stanford University.
In the first place, therefore, the resolution
demands that each house allow its initiates
a reasonable amount of time to sleep and
study during Pledge Week and that it not
employ an excess of physical punishment that
might in any way have a lasting elTect.
The clause referring to anything "harmful
to the prestige of Stanford University" implies
that Pledge Week must be carried on entirely
within the house. This ban takes in all
"quests," including not only those that lead
to destruction or defacing of University or
private property, but also the more innocent
excursions that could in any way relied on the
name of Stanford.
Stanford fraternities gave formal consent
to the civilizing of Creek initiations when they
signed the resolution which said that "we, the
undersigned, by a vote of the majority of the
members of the house, do declare that Hell
Week is hereby eliminated from our fraternity
initiation program."
This sane, sensible Pledge Week was insti
tuted for the purpose of keeping unfavorable
publicity, like that which has emanated from
Berkeley's Row, from permeating the Farm.
Early indications provided by the fraternities
who have already initiated their sophomores
point to the success of Stanford's newly in
stalled, civilized Pledge Week.

who have already initiated their sophomores
point to the success of Stanford's newly in
stalled, civilized Pledge Week.
While two major "kick - backs" at Hell
Week practices among University of Cali
fornia fraternities in the past month have
prompted Berkeley oilicials to commence for
mulation of plans for milder pre-initiations,
Stanford watches her twenty-four Creek-let
ter organizations go about a more civilized
process of initiating their neophytes into sa
cred brotherhood.
A genuine shudder passed up and down
California's Kow four weeks ago when a near
fatality resulted from over - exuberant Hell
Week practices. Berkeley Creeks were given
another set-back last Wednesday when live
pledges, attempting to fulfill a "quest," were
arraigned in police court on theft counts.
A few of Stanford's houses in the meantime
have held their initiations and attendant
Pledge Week activities; others look forward
to an entirely within-thc-housc pre-initiation
period sometime during the next few weeks.
To date, no violations of the resolution ban
ning Hell Week, which was approved by every
Stanford fraternity last spring, have been re
ported to the Interfraternity Board. The
spirit of the resolution was in the nature of a
"gentlemen's agreement," and it was not in
tended as a hard and fast law, enforcible by
certain definite penalties.
Although the agreement leaves much of the
enforcement and judgment to each individual
house, it firmly denounces two former Hell
Week practices: first, practices that are in

jurious to the initiate in health and scholar
ship; second, practices that are harmful to
the prestige of Stanford University.
In the first place, therefore, the resolution
demands that each house allow its initiates
a reasonable amount of time to sleep and
study during Pledge Week and that it not
employ an excess of physical punishment that
might in any way have a lasting elTect.
The clause referring to anything "harmful
to the prestige of Stanford University" implies
that Pledge Week must be carried on entirely
within the house. This ban takes in all
"quests," including not only those that lead
to destruction or defacing of University or
private property, but also the more innocent
excursions that could in any way relied on the
name of Stanford.
Stanford fraternities gave formal consent
to the civilizing of Creek initiations when they
signed the resolution which said that "we, the
undersigned, by a vote of the majority of the
members of the house, do declare that Hell
Week is hereby eliminated from our fraternity
initiation program."
This sane, sensible Pledge Week was insti
tuted for the purpose of keeping unfavorable
publicity, like that which has emanated from
Berkeley's Row, from permeating the Farm.
Early indications provided by the fraternities
who have already initiated their sophomores
point to the success of Stanford's newly in
stalled, civilized Pledge Week.
