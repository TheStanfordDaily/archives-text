# Not as Mushy, But Improvable

In defeat, Stanford rooters had enough
gumption to sing their hymn with more gusto
than was observable the preceding week in
victory. The last week saw comment on the
poor quality of hymn-singing made in several
places, with some slight rise in interest on
the part of the student body.
A few courageous souls evidently went to
the bother to learn more of the words than
just "Hail, Stanford, Hail." Yet the uphill
light has not been won. Some student organi
zation or official must take the responsibility
for devising some organized method of teach
ing the hymn to students, especially new ones.
That hymn-teaching can be effective has
been proved by many schools. That Stanford
students still have some interest in rooting
was amply evidenced by the two resounding
axe-yells that were the high point in rooting
in the stadium on Saturday.
A week ago, the hymn sounded decidedly
ill; last Saturday it was in the convalescent
stage. However, it still requires considerable
nursing and tender care. If the Rally Com
mittee or some like organization should take
the hymn under its guidance and teach it to
the student body, the song would be robust
and normal again by Big Came time.
