On to the Rose Bowl!
Keep Cool with Coolidge.
Let's swing it.
On to the Rose Bowl!
Get out of the office.
Charity begins at home.
It looks like an early fall.
Summer quarter at Stanford is delightful,
Tuition is higher than ever.
IVTakc this a white Christmas.
We have a nicer comptroller.
And higher syllabus fees.
And terrific freshman women.
Our goal posts didn't have any fighting spirit
We gave them the axe.
They took it.
On to the Rose Bowl!
Double trouble trouble.
What a business, oooooh-oooooh.
Oooooh-hoooooh!
Please pass the aspirin.
On to the Rose Bowl!
Aw, shut up.
