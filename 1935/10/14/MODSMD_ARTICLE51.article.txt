## DEMENTIA AMERICANA—1935 
### 
I'he first time I saw a certain football player he
drew a house even Katherine Cornell vainly dreams
of. He was the star in a thrilling performance at the
U.C. stadium, applauded by thousands for his display
of football genius.
He was husky then, clear-headed as well, but all
the same an addict to the insanity of the gridiron—he
played not only with his body but with his soul.
And every time he fell to the field with the other team
on top of him, it was mind, as well as his body, that
took the impact.
* * * *
The last time I saw him was in the Palo Alto Hospi
tal. He was thin almost to the point of scrawniness.
The skin was stretched over his face like tissue paper
over the ribs of a Chinese lantern. But it > wasn't his
emaciation that gave him away. It was his eyes—
opaque, black shoe-buttons sewed on either side oi'
his nose.
Those who claimed they knew the inside dope said
he was insane. It wasn't many years after he grad
uated from U.C. that the city papers had him in the
Alameda City and County Hospital for "rheumatism."
Then, suddenly, he turned up in Palo Alto, a partici
pant in a phony street fight, and a derelict who was
put away for the night in a hospital bed.
* * * *
We who saw him in his palmy days often wonder
if his condition had any i-elation to football. Was it
merely coincidental or inevitable that he should snap,
or did his stark love for the game, his blind fury when
he saw the ball snap back from center, do some
strange thing to him, magnificent and strong as he
was?
Perhaps, too, today's gridiron greats are well with
in the limits of safety, never over-straining, never
over-punishing themselves in the heat of a game.
Or perhaps coaches know now, in this day of foot
ball's adulthood, to pick players with a sufficient
margin of endurance to take care of the life-drain
of practice and play.
But it isn't out of order to wonder just how long
this man and that can keep up the grind. And to hope
that our idols won't show cracks after holocaust on
holocaust of the internal combustion called "the
game." —Bob Eisenbach

of football genius.
He was husky then, clear-headed as well, but all
the same an addict to the insanity of the gridiron—he
played not only with his body but with his soul.
And every time he fell to the field with the other team
on top of him, it was mind, as well as his body, that
took the impact.
* * * *
The last time I saw him was in the Palo Alto Hospi
tal. He was thin almost to the point of scrawniness.
The skin was stretched over his face like tissue paper
over the ribs of a Chinese lantern. But it > wasn't his
emaciation that gave him away. It was his eyes—
opaque, black shoe-buttons sewed on either side oi'
his nose.
Those who claimed they knew the inside dope said
he was insane. It wasn't many years after he grad
uated from U.C. that the city papers had him in the
Alameda City and County Hospital for "rheumatism."
Then, suddenly, he turned up in Palo Alto, a partici
pant in a phony street fight, and a derelict who was
put away for the night in a hospital bed.

We who saw him in his palmy days often wonder
if his condition had any i-elation to football. Was it
merely coincidental or inevitable that he should snap,
or did his stark love for the game, his blind fury when
he saw the ball snap back from center, do some
strange thing to him, magnificent and strong as he
was?
Perhaps, too, today's gridiron greats are well with
in the limits of safety, never over-straining, never
over-punishing themselves in the heat of a game.
Or perhaps coaches know now, in this day of foot
ball's adulthood, to pick players with a sufficient
margin of endurance to take care of the life-drain
of practice and play.
But it isn't out of order to wonder just how long
this man and that can keep up the grind. And to hope
that our idols won't show cracks after holocaust on
holocaust of the internal combustion called "the
game." —Bob Eisenbach
