# BEARD AND RADICALISM
## 
### 
'■ The Editor, Sir:
In regard to McClelland's claim
i that Charles A. Beard should be re
j moved from the reading lists be
cause he is too radical, may I ask if
! McClelland has ever read any of
Beard's works?
On page 40 of Beard's "American
Government and Politics" is the fol
' lowing statement: ". . . . these prin
ciples were unique when the Con
j stitution was formed; they presented
' a sharp contrast to the absolute
■ monarchies then prevailing in Eu
j rope. And today they offer an
j equally sharp contrast to the dicta
j torships of communism and fascism
. . . upon the maintenance and de
velopment of these principles de-»
pends, in a large measure, the future
of American society. . .
Joel Stein
With this letter the Beard-rad
icalism controversy is dropped.—
Ed.
