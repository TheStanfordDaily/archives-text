# ANOTHER CALIFORNIA?
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Arc we turning into another Cali
fornia in that we fail to show the
proper respect for the hymn of a
rival school?
From the actions of a part of the
rooting section at Saturday's game,
the question should be answered in
the affirmative. Hooting, cat-calls,
and salutes to Hitler may have their
proper places, but they certainly
show a brand of exceedingly poor
taste when used during the cere
mony after the game.
Win or lose, let's live up to those
things for which Stanford has always
stoodâ€”courtesy and sportsmanship
at all times.
