"I LIVE MY LIFE"
At the Fox-Stanford
B Emerging with regular
sized, unsmeared lips, more
attractive if more ordinary
coiffures, Joan Crawford rides
a .mule backwards and strikes a
note of sparkling spontaneity un
known to her more recent films.
"I Live My Life" is a thoroughly
enjoyable cinema in which Miss
Crawford comes down to earth to be
herself.
Brian Aherne in his first starring
part is a refreshing relief from Rob
ert Montgomery and Franchote Tone
as a naive, stubborn archeologist
who chases Joan from his unearthed
statues in Greece and finally takes
her away from New York's soft,
spoiled high society. Frank Morgan
and the screen's two best comedy
butlers, Eric Blore ("Top Hat") and
Arthur Treacher, complete a cast
which makes this rich girl-poor boy
story completely entertaining.

"EVERY NIGHT AT EIGHT"
Also at the Stanford
CA cinema night-mare con
cerning the rise of three
girls and a band leader to
radio fame, "Every Night at
Eight" is handicapped from the be
ginning by a negligible perform
ance by sleekster George Raft. But
audience pleasure is partially re
vived by Patsy Kelly's rowdy wise
cracks, Frances Langford's voice
(best song: "I'm in a Mood for
Love"), and Alice Faye's particular
type of attractiveness. â€”Botsford
