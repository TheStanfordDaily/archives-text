# Profit Made At Campus Dance
## 
### 
| The A.S.S.U. dance held in the
I Women's Gym Saturday night in
; honor of the week-end visitors from
the Bruin campus was a distinct
success, Gib Holloway, chairman of
the dance committee, opined last
night with a satisfied smile. Hollo
way went on to say that the hop
was not only a social success but
also* netted a little money for the
A.S.S.U. coffers.
Contributing to the success of the
dance was a short but amusing talk
by Ted Lambert, president of the
U.C.L.A. student body. He was in
troduced by Wally Brooke, Stanford
student body president.
Music for the dance, which lasted
I a short three hours, was furnished
iby Freddie Nagel's orchestra, the
same band which entertained at the
Reg Dance earlier in the fall. Nagel
presented as guest singers, Cab Cal
loway, ex-football player, and Dud
ley Nix, late of Tom Coakley's or
j chestra. The lighting effects in the
courtyard and gym, true to promise,
i were quite unique.
A feature which made the dance
; a success for many of the people—
1 650 being the estimate of A.S.S.U.
| officials as to the number of students
| in attendance—was the lack of stags
| who usually assemble to try their
1 luck at such gatherings.
