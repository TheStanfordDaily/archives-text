# Drivers Given Warning On New Offenses
## 
### 
Remember those days when
you tould ride four in that
front seat and have two run
ning-board hangers-on?
"Remember" is the right
word, because you're going to
get a neat printed traffic cita
tion from Officer Gordon Davis
if you have more than the girl
friend and room-mate inside
your car, and anyone outside.
The regulation has been
made necessary by injuries
sustained last year by three
students who rode on running
boards, or who drove their cars
with vision obstructed by the
overload of a front seat.
