# Weaver Tells New Features For Gaieties
## 
### 
The Gaieties of 1935 will be played
entirely in reverse order; the au
dience will be on the stage, the
players in the seats, announces Win
stead Weaver who rejoined the cast
of the show yesterday. We believe
that this will save much time and
trouble, he continued.
New acts keep rolling in. The
Fiercesome Flying Foursome will do
their famous magic stunt, flying over
the audience and finally disappear
ing. Mac Gordon, whose music fig
ured prominently in the spring
show, the Follies Bourgeois, has
promised two new tunes.
"Still," said Weaver, "I feel very
hurt at the scarcity of skits that
have been turned in. There haven't
been enough. So far, I have re
ceived 4000, only one of which was
good, and since that was a panto
mime, we had to discard it as use
less." Friday, October 18, remains
the deadline date for handing in
skits.
All beautiful girls who aspire for
stage fame, should appear Monday,
October 21, for the chorus tryouts.
