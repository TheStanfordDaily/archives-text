# Party Boys, Flappers, Poor Mates: Terman
## 
### BOB EISENBACH 
"He" may be a swell date, but if
he's a parlor-smart night owl the
chances are he won't make a very
good husband.
"She" may be a swell babe, but if
she rates an "A" in dancing, she'll
probably rate an "F" at wifing.
All you gals and guys with an eye
out for "only ones" can take that
straight from Dr. Lewis M. Terman,
Stanford psychologist, who bases his
conclusion on a recently-completed
survey of 300 married couples.
Judicial Gong
For every three wedding bells
you hoar, one is the gong signifying
marital failure, his survey shows. Of
the 300 couples tested, 100 were di
vorced, 100 unhappily married, only
100 glad they took the plunge.
Men, generally, find more happi
ness in marriage than their wives.
Dr. Terman found, by adding up
"happiness scores" of surveyed
couples. With a highest possible
grade of 62 points, 42 husbands
scored between 59 and 62 while only
28 wives felt extreme satisfaction in
their marriage.

Wives First to Divorce
Wives, incidentally, are the first to
consider divorce as a way out of an
unhappy marital situation. But they j
arc not gold-diggers when the ali
mony settlement comes up. Divor
cees are less mercenary than wives, '
for they think mostly of a career. '
and. of money only as a means to
independence, Dr. Terman found.
But even though unhappily mar
ried. 57 per cent of couples on the
"not so good" side of the marital
ledger said that if they had to choose
their mates over again, they would i
pick the same persons. Ninety-nine
per cent of those happily married j
indicated the same intention. Of the
entire group, only 14 per cent would
marry a different mate, and only 8
per cent would not marry at all, the j
survey showed. ]
Finances First Fuss
When you get married, what do
you think you'll quarrel about? Dr.
Terman's group nominates the
handling of family finances as the
Mussolini in marital Ethiopias.
In line of popularity, other quar

rel-provokers arc: recreation, re
ligious matters, demonstrations of
affection, friends, intimate relations,
caring for the children, table man
ners. matters of conventionality, phi
losophy of life, and ways of dealing
with in-laws.
To be happy, outside interests arc
a necessity, Dr. Terman found. Of
the happily married group, 31 per
cent indicated a mutual outside in
terest, 65 per cent some mutual in
terests, and 4 per cent wrote "very
few." On the unhappy group, only
10 per cent of husbands and wives
share each other's outside interests.
Age No Factor
That discovery makes a new mari
tal bugaboo, but another part of the
survey breaks an old one. Dr. Ter
man could find no relation between
marital happiness and age at mar
riage, nor any correlation between
age differences in couples and happi
ness scores.
And here goes another one: chil
dren, while rendering divorce less
likely, appear to have no effect on
marital happiness.
If your folks were happy, the
chances are much better for your
marriage license being something
besides a piece of paper, the survey
indicates.
Parents' Happiness Vital
Forty per cent of happily married
couples rated both their parents as
enjoying a marriage above the con-
tentment average. Only 18 per cent
of this same group found their par
ents' marriages below the mean of
mutual hen-pecking. Ten per cent
of the parents of those unhappily
married were below the happiness .
average, while only 23 were above.
But when it comes to getting along
with mother, the wife has a worse
score than hubby. Among unhappily
married women, only 28 per cent
could report no conflict, while 44
per cent of their husbands gave a
like answer. Even among 55 per cent
of happy wives, mother is a cause of
conflict.
All Had Education
The survey was conducted through
couples, contacted by psychologists,
in churches and organizations in
California. They were all American
born whites not over 60 years of age
and had had at least one year of high
school education.
Over 71 per cent of those con-
tacted were willing to fill out the
blanks necessary for their entry in
the experiment. All information
was held strictly confidential, and
information blanks were destroyed
following tabulation of the results,
Dr. Terman said.
"MURDER," SAYS PUGH
MIAMI, Fla., Oct. 14 (AP).â€”Ser-
geant Paul Pugh, second in com-
mand of veterans Camp No. 3 in
the Florida Keys, told an American
Legion investigating committee this
afternoon failure of officers to evac
uate the camp before the Labor Day
hurricane was "wholesale murder."
