### 
"It struck me like a thunderbolt." Those were Tiny Thornhill's
words last night regarding the loss of Frankie Alustiza to Stanford
football.
"It'll be two or three days before I fully realize what's happened.
And as far as the new backfield combination is concerned that will
have to remain undecided till things straighten out a bit.
"Right now I think I'll use Joe Vigna for Frankie at right half but
that's not definite. I might try moving Glenn Hamilton from his left
half position to the other side and giving him a try. At any rate, it'll
mean that all our halfbacks will have to learn to play both sides."
"It's hard news to take."
