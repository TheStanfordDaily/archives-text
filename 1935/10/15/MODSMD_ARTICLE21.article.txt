## 
### 
Speaking last night on the Stan
| ford Radio Hour on "The Univer
! sity and Nursing Education," Miss
1 Edith H. Smith, director of the
Nursing Service in Stanford Hospi
i tals, emphasized the fact that evo
lutionary trends point in the direc
tion of a closer affiliation between
the university and the well equip
i ped hospital in training and edu
' eating nurses.
Of the factors operating to broad
en the scope of nursing education
and link it with the university, Miss
1 Smith believes the most important
are the growing knowledge ol pub
; lie health and mental hygiene, and
J the shift in emphasis from curative
I to preventive medicine and nursing.
Due to the increase in fields now
! open to nurses, there is a need for a
broader and more comprehensive
I preparation for the demands being
I made on them, and this may be
I gained through affiliation with the
| university schools of nursing.
Regarding the preparation, Miss
Smith said that in the first place,
there is a more careful selection of
i students; secondly, the university
maintains a desirable academic and
professional standard for tho teach
l ing staff of the School of Nursing;
i and third, and perhaps most import
ant., is the contribution the univer
sity can make in the field of nursing
education.
