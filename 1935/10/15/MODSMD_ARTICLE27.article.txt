# Alustiza Out For Season
## Basque's Grid Career Ended By Eye Injury Star Indian Halfback Hurt During Third Quarter Of Bruin Game Stanford Hopes Pale Physician Says Frankie's Football Days Over 
### Gordy Frost 
Frankie Alustiza is through play
ing football.
To shake an already upset Indian
football team and its following to
the very quick, came those words
from the lips of team physician Fritz
Roth last night.
A separation in the cornea of
the right eye, incurred some time
during the third quarter of last
Saturday's Bruin game, will defi
nitely keep Alustiza off the grid
for the remainder of this, his last
season with the Indians.
Dr. Gordon Smith, attending eye
specialist, consulted as he emerged
from Alustiza's room at the Stanford
Hospital last night, reported the in
jured halfback's condition in a spe
cial statement to The Daily.
"Frankie is not permanently in
jured, but for him to consider play
ing another game is foolhardy. The
nature of the injury forbids that he
risk another jar that might renew
the damage and impair his eyesight
permanently."
Alustiza himself, under some pain
and ordered to remain in the utmost
quiet last night, was not sure just
when the injury occurred. He
thought it must have happened
shortly after the half when he car
ried the ball and drove low into a
mass of Uclan players.
His temple struck an opponent's
hip pad a direct blow, jarring the
cornea of the eye and causing vis
ion to become hazy.
A few plays later when Alustiza
was called upon to hold the ball for
Moscrip's attempted field goal, team
mates heard him complain that he
couldn't see well enough to do the
job well.
Following the game the injury
gave little indication that it was
anything more than common "after
game-dizziness" but by Sunday night
it took on the color of real trouble.
Yesterday afternoon Frankie went,
to the hospital for examination. Drs.
Roth, Smith, and Hans Balkan, not
ed San Francisco eye specialist sum
moned to Stanford for consultation,
agreed the Frankie's football days
are over if he wishes to consider the
future of his eyesight.
To cinch the possibility that Frank
would never again run onto a Stan
ford playing field Tiny Thomhill
went on record last night with words
to that effect.
"Frankie won't play for Stan
ford even if his eye does show
great improvement. We want no
man to risk a permanent injury to
his health just for football."
Thornhill was undecided last night
in his plans to fill the backfield va
cancy. Sines Stanford plays no game
for two weeks, he chose to postpone
action on that matter "until things
straighten out a bit."
