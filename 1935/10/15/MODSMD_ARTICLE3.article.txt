# Men's Council Frames Plans To Teach Code
## Frosh To Be Instructed In Honor Code Meaning 
### 
After dispensing with the routine
speeding cases yesterday afternoon,
the Men's Council, in its weekly
meeting, discussed plans for ac
quainting the frosh with the regula
tions and responsibilities of the
Stanford Honor Code, Bob Gros,
chairman of the council, announced
last night.
The Council decided to inform the
new men students of the honor code
provisos en masse this year instead
of the usual small groups which
have been the practice for the past
few years. For this purpose a gen
eral assembly will be held in Encina
lobby some time next week. Fresh
man attendance will be required.
Speakers at the gathering will be
Bob Gros, chairman of the council,
and Alf Brandin, a member of the
Men's Council. After the general as
sembly is concluded the frosh will
be broken into small groups, each
under the tutelage of one of the five
council members, for informal semi
nars in which the finer points will be
discussed.
Edmund Littlefield, president of
inter-fraternity council, will be in
vited to speak at the assembly to ac
quaint the frosh with the rushing
rules.
