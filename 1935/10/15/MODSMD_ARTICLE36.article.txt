RAIN MAY HELP
STANFORD NOW
When the storm clouds rolled over
Stanford last spring and drops of
rain flooded old Angell Field, Indian
track team and enthusiasts threw
up their hands. Wet weather spelled
disaster for cindermen.
But yesterday when the clouds
unleashed their moisture content
and softened the Stanford prac
tice field it was considered almost
good luck. For the Indians can
best become acquainted with the
feel of slippery turf.
A week from Saturday they meet
Jimmy Phelan's Washington Hus
kies on their Seattle field and the
chances are slim that Stanford will
be blessed with a dry turf. Rather,
it is far more probable that the In
dians will do some mighty fancy
slipping on one of the better muddy
fields of the West.
And hardly can Stanford af
ford to waste any time churning
mud against the Huskies. Mr.
Phelan's lads, you will remem
ber, are the gentlemen who upset
mighty Santa Clara so unostenta
tiously two weeks ago.
Last week-end they drew a bye.
On the coming Saturday, while Stan
ford rests, they are slated to meet
Washington State.
THEY LOOKED
FOR GRAYSON
A dash of native Hawaii invaded
the solitude of the Stanford Farm
last week in the persons of some
30 islanders, members of the Mc-
Kinley High School football team
that played and lost 19-0 to San
Jose State Saturday.
They average only 150 pounds
per man so it's not surprising that
San Jose was victorious, but ac
cording to Hobby Grayson, who
became acquainted with the type
of football they play in the islands
during his stay there last summer,
"they are mighty tough little ball
players."
It seems that the Mcinley bids had
one major wish when they were be
ing led around the Farm. They
wanted to see Grayson. Everywhere
they went they asked for Bobby.
The final blow came when they
were'being shown the mosaic on the
lront of Stanford's Memorial Chapel.
They all stood gazing upward, some
of the older members commenting
on its beauty.
Then one little fellow, who still
wasn't very far along in high
school, pulled the prize. Said he,
"Yea, it's pretty good, but which
one of those guys is Grayson."
