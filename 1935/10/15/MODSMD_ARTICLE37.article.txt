But they aren't.
Tiny Thornhill's 40-odd gridders
j are once again the "laughing boys"
| of old.
They worked out yesterday in a
; practice field of mud, in anticipation
lof a rainy battle in Washington's
i Seattle stadium two weeks hence,
j And not a wisp of defeatism was
apparent.
Not out in suits were Bones Ham
ilton, Frank Alustiza, Monk Moscrip,
j and Keith Topping.
Hamilton is not in the hospital,
i but will probably be out of practice
i for a couple of days. It's the leg
| again. Moscrip is banged up in gen
eral, with a bad knee that keeps
him from doing the kick-off honors,
and a lacerated hand.
Chief talk about the U.C.L.A. affair
still centers about the gieat work of
