# Soccer Squad Strengthened
## San Mateo Jaysee Plays Indians Tomorrow 
### 
With the addition of A1 Velarde
and Mike Gomez, both from South
America, to the soccer squad, Stan
ford's hopes for a victory in the
opening conference game with Stan
Mateo J.C. tomorrow afternoon have
been raised considerably.
The two players are expected to
greatly strengthen the forward wall,
which thus far has been about the
only worry Coach Dick Bullis has
had.
The San Mateo outfit, although it
dropped a 3-0 contest to California
last week, will be no cinch for the
home clutt, according to Bullis.
However, the squad that faces the
boys from the junior college will be
the best the Farm has turned out
for two or three years.
The practice yesterday was sus
pended because of the rain, but
Bullis announced that an important
workout would be held today at 4
o'clock.
In a practice game Saturday with
Galileo High School, the frosh
looked good in spots, especially on
offense, but there is plenty of room
for improvement, the coach believes.
