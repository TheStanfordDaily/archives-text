# Frosh Stress Pass Defense
## Bradshaw Drills Charges For S.C. Frosh Game 
### 
Intent upon perfecting his Papoose
gridders for their annual contest
with the Trobabes Saturday in Los
Angeles, Coach Jimmy Bradshaw
put his charges through defensive
drills last night. Pass defense was
stressed.
Bradshaw had Garnier, Glasser,
Kirsch, deWitt and Zeller working
against S.C. pass plays as run by
the reserves. While the frosh pass
defense looked good against Sacra
mento and Menlo, there were mo
ments when things looked bad.
With Cufnmings in the line-up at
left end, the Papooses will scale 200
pounds per man in the line, and no
team will push them around for
long at a time. However, the Tro
babes are a classy outfit, and they
may cause plenty of trouble through
the air lanes.
There will be plenty of scrim
mage against U.S.C. plays the next
couple of days, and by game time
Saturday, the coaches, will have
done all in their power to stymie
the Trobabes. All last week the
fourth string spent working on S.C.
plays. Saturday morning they
played Lowell High of San Fran
cisco, thus adding more experience
for th'eyr work against the first
string this week.
It's '"On to Troy" in a very big
way as far as the frosh are con
cerned.
