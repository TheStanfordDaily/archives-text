# "Let the Winds of Freedom Blow"
## Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily Member of the Associated Press American Olympic Boycott Would Be Permanent Blow to Amateur Athletics

Of direct concern to Stanford's track team,
now being groomed for a potential national
championship, is the information that oppo
sition to American participation in the Olym
pic Games in Berlin next summer had suffered
a conclusive set-hack in New York last week.
Should the move to cancel the Olympics fail,
they will provide a corps of present and re
cently graduated Indian runners, swimmers,
and other athletes with an opportunity of
gaining international distinction in the clean
est sport on the entire athletic program—one
that is entirely unsullied by charges of pro
fessionalism or proselyting.
By a two and one-half to one vote, the New
York district A.A.I . went on record us oppos
ing the cancellation of Berlin as the I9«'W
Games site. The opposition move, strongly
supported by Jeremiah T. Mahouev, national
A.A.U. president, had previou- .y been favored
by the New .Jersey, Southern, and South At
lantic A.A.U. districts.
Since the metropolitan district has the
largest and strongest Jewish and Catholic rep
resentation in. the country, the vote was seen
as the tin .in- point in the move for cancel
lation, although the final decision will await

the union's December convention.
The Nazi government in the meantime has
heeded the complaints and gives reasonable
assurance that it will not discriminate against
any race or religious creed, either on its own
team or on that of a visiting country.
Cancellation of the Berlin Olympics would
serve the obviously intended purpose—that of
an affront to the German government. At the
same time, however, it would be more of an
affront to the International Olympic Games
committee and to the Games themselves.
If the United States boycotts the 1930 Olym
piad, it is virtually certain that several Euro
pean countries, many of which are largely
populated by Catholics and Jews, will follow
suit. This would completely destroy the spirit
of next year's Games, and it would provide
them with a lasting "black eye."
It is imperative to the very foundation of
the Olympics that they not be tampered with
by cancellation as a racial or religious pro
test. To Stanford, the Games are a chance for
Indian athletes to gain international recog
nition in return for four years of hard train
ing. To the world, they are a sure-fire pro
moter of sportsmanship, and one of the most
active international peace movements.

supported by Jeremiah T. Mahouev, national
A.A.U. president, had previou- .y been favored
by the New .Jersey, Southern, and South At
lantic A.A.U. districts.
Since the metropolitan district has the
largest and strongest Jewish and Catholic rep
resentation in. the country, the vote was seen
as the tin .in- point in the move for cancel
lation, although the final decision will await

the union's December convention.
The Nazi government in the meantime has
heeded the complaints and gives reasonable
assurance that it will not discriminate against
any race or religious creed, either on its own
team or on that of a visiting country.
Cancellation of the Berlin Olympics would
serve the obviously intended purpose—that of
an affront to the German government. At the
same time, however, it would be more of an
affront to the International Olympic Games
committee and to the Games themselves.
If the United States boycotts the 1930 Olym
piad, it is virtually certain that several Euro
pean countries, many of which are largely
populated by Catholics and Jews, will follow
suit. This would completely destroy the spirit
of next year's Games, and it would provide
them with a lasting "black eye."
It is imperative to the very foundation of
the Olympics that they not be tampered with
by cancellation as a racial or religious pro
test. To Stanford, the Games are a chance for
Indian athletes to gain international recog
nition in return for four years of hard train
ing. To the world, they are a sure-fire pro
moter of sportsmanship, and one of the most
active international peace movements.
Of direct concern to Stanford's track team,
now being groomed for a potential national
championship, is the information that oppo
sition to American participation in the Olym
pic Games in Berlin next summer had suffered
a conclusive set-hack in New York last week.
Should the move to cancel the Olympics fail,
they will provide a corps of present and re
cently graduated Indian runners, swimmers,
and other athletes with an opportunity of
gaining international distinction in the clean
est sport on the entire athletic program—one
that is entirely unsullied by charges of pro
fessionalism or proselyting.
By a two and one-half to one vote, the New
York district A.A.I . went on record us oppos
ing the cancellation of Berlin as the I9«'W
Games site. The opposition move, strongly
supported by Jeremiah T. Mahouev, national
A.A.U. president, had previou- .y been favored
