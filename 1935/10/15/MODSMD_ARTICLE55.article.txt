# There Is Something In This Spirit Thing

From the East conies an unusual story by
Paul (iallico, noted sports scribe, telling of
Yale's "spirit" in beating Pennsylvania, with
but little narration of the game itself, (iallico
"was greatly impressed with the possibility
that the traditional lighting spirit of the Blue
was the real cause of victory.
Heartening this should be to Sons of llie
Red here on the Farm, for within three days
have come two disheartening blows to lovers
of the Indian teams. First the U.C.L.A. de
bacle, then the loss ot Frankie Alustiza, not
an All-American, but possibly the most im

portent, steadiest cog in the Big Bed Machine.
But alter a pause out of respect to Frank,
the team will go on, backed by loyal Stanford
men, to prove to doubters that it is still one
of the finest football aggregations in the coun
tryâ€”and that there is something in Ibis busi
ness of lighting spirit.
