# Our Hasher Sez

The first rain hit the campus suddenly. Ovr?r in the
Hall of Mirrors and Horrors, the pounding of the rain
upon the window aroused a freshman from a steady
study stupor. He leaned out the window and shouted:
"Hey, sponsor, somebody's t'rowing water."
"Sophomore on the phone!" reverberated through
out the Phi Delt house, but the phone kept on ringing,
and no sophomores were in evidence. Some of the
upper classmen happened to glance into a room from
which most of the yelling was coming. And there were
the sophomores, reverberating happily.
Although there are critics who say that Our Hasher
occupies something of the position of the campus gar
bage inspector, there has always been a plank in Our
Hasher's platform in regard to the fundamental whole
someness of the Stanford women and the purity of
Stanford men.
In proof of this we offer this story: A nice, old lady
owned a certain capacious and extensive ranch in the
foothills back of the campus. That is, it was capacious
at all times except on week-end nights, when the
hillsides were dotted with romance.
The nice, old lady finally became very exasperated
and called in the sheriff to round up these Stanford
students and teach the young scalawags a lesson.
The sheriff headed for the round-up, but the fish
that came to his net were all Paly and Sequoia High
students.
At the A.S.S.U. dance Saturday night, a freshman
woman asked her escort where the bar in the women's
gym was. She wasn't referring to the horizontal bar
or the over-the-mountain bar. She meant, "Bar."
There is a very precise Classical Lit major who be
lieves in doing everything right. This scholar, in fact,
has done everything so right that he would have had a
straight A average, except that some old nasty slapped
a B plus on him in a three-unit course. Anyway, with
true school spirit the Classical Lit major adjoiimed
his Saturday afternoon classes to attend the Indian
massacre in the Stadium Saturday afternoon. During
the card stunts as per instructions, the Classical Lit
major held his card directly under his eyes, with a
scientific adjustment of t 16 of an inch for clearance.
This, however, proved unsatisfactory, since it did not
allow for academic freedom. So the scholar tore out
a notch in the top of the cards and struck the card
up around the nose, making a very, very snug lit
indeed.
