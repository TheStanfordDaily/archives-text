## REASON FOR THE BAWL-OUT 
### 
Last Saturday it came out again . . . that yellow
covered unfortunate necessity . . . the Bawl-Out.
•A* A' * >;«
Today it is possible to climb the slippery, curved
staii's of the Ad building, lay our money in the cookie
pan of a cash box, take out as much change as your
conscience permits, and walk off with a trim little bit
of printing that will give you a general idea of how
the professors have been grading every fellow student
since he entered the University. Some will buy the
Bawl-Out for the malicious pleasure of learning the
academic standings of others. Some will buy it for
phone numbers and addresses. And some will buy it
for the purpose for which it is intended.
* * * *
That purpose—the reason why the Administration
goes to the trouble and expense of getting cut the
Bawl-Out four times a year—is not generally known.
If the University would include a short preamble ex
plaining the reason, periodic and bothersome attacks
on the justification of the Student Directory might be
averted.
♦ * * #
Yeai's ago there was no Bawl-Out. And thus thex-e
was no way for students to know how they stood in
matters regulated by gi'ades unless they callcd at the
Ad building and made a personal query. In those
days, even as now, there wex-e certain enlightened
individuals who had such a commendable contempt for
the arbitrary judgments of teachers in the matter of
gi'ades that they never bothered to call for their marks
at the end of the quarter.
* # si: if.
Often as much as a fourth of the student body
would forego calling for gx-ades. As a result many a
student went blithely through quarter after quarter
unaware of unxecorded incompletes, minus gxade
points, even flunks. And when graduation time came
ai'ound loud were the groans when such calamities
prevented the granting of sheepskins.
* # * *
With the inauguration of the Bawl-Out, a student
could hardly escape seeing how he made out during
the preceding quarter at some time during each three
month period, and the ills cited above were remedied
over night. Aside from that, the Bawl-Out is justi
fied in that it makes it possible for a student to enjoy
the delectable pleasure of scoi'ning the upshot of a
professor's whims, and at the same time know how he
stands with the University in general. .

Yeai's ago there was no Bawl-Out. And thus thex-e
was no way for students to know how they stood in
matters regulated by gi'ades unless they callcd at the
Ad building and made a personal query. In those
days, even as now, there wex-e certain enlightened
individuals who had such a commendable contempt for
the arbitrary judgments of teachers in the matter of
gi'ades that they never bothered to call for their marks
at the end of the quarter.

Often as much as a fourth of the student body
would forego calling for gx-ades. As a result many a
student went blithely through quarter after quarter
unaware of unxecorded incompletes, minus gxade
points, even flunks. And when graduation time came
ai'ound loud were the groans when such calamities
prevented the granting of sheepskins.

With the inauguration of the Bawl-Out, a student
could hardly escape seeing how he made out during
the preceding quarter at some time during each three
month period, and the ills cited above were remedied
over night. Aside from that, the Bawl-Out is justi
fied in that it makes it possible for a student to enjoy
the delectable pleasure of scoi'ning the upshot of a
professor's whims, and at the same time know how he
stands with the University in general. .

Last Saturday it came out again . . . that yellow
covered unfortunate necessity . . . the Bawl-Out.
•A* A' * >;«
Today it is possible to climb the slippery, curved
staii's of the Ad building, lay our money in the cookie
pan of a cash box, take out as much change as your
conscience permits, and walk off with a trim little bit
of printing that will give you a general idea of how
the professors have been grading every fellow student
since he entered the University. Some will buy the
Bawl-Out for the malicious pleasure of learning the
academic standings of others. Some will buy it for
phone numbers and addresses. And some will buy it
for the purpose for which it is intended.
* * * *
That purpose—the reason why the Administration
goes to the trouble and expense of getting cut the
Bawl-Out four times a year—is not generally known.
If the University would include a short preamble ex
plaining the reason, periodic and bothersome attacks
on the justification of the Student Directory might be
averted.
