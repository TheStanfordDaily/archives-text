THE EARLY BIRD, 1935 edition,
; is personified by San Francisco's
Palace Hotel, with plans for Big
Game Night already laid. Three or
chestras will blare forth in all their
j effulgent raucousness. (Boy, are we
i getting flighty!) In addition to the
! usual Paul Pendarvis, there will
also be Carvel Craig and his lads,
| formerly of these parts, and Fred
die Nagel's campus band. Custo
| mers are promised the freedom of
roaming from one room to another,
but at $5.25 a plate, they ought to
throw in a couple of other hotels
also. . . . Pendarvis, incidentally,
will be here until after the new year.
MAY ROBSON, beloved old lady
j of the screen, is making her first
stage appearance in five years in
"Kind Lady," now at the Curran
Theater. Ol' Massa Rumor hath it
| that the play is really a tense and
exciting one, and that Miss Robson
is supported by an excellent sup
porting cast, of which Ralph Forbes
1 is the outstanding member.
NOW THAT publicity day is over
with (including that subtle little
plug for Chappie), we can pass on to
morsels such as: . . . Scripts of "One
Man's Family" are sent to Austra
lia for adaptation and broadcasting
| over a ten-station chain there. . . .
Nat Finston has resigned as mu

sical director of Paramount. . . . His
assistant, Irvin Talbot, replaces him.
. . . Nino Martini is being touted as
a male Grace Moore after the pre
mieres of his picture, "Here's to
Romance."
"SANTIAGO'S POLICE hand out
courtesy cards to petting parties in
public parks. The cards read, 'Please
| restrain your ardor'."â€”Filler in the
Paly Times.
