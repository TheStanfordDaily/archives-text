# SLOWLY DECAYING?

I The Editor, Sir:
Does the honor code extend to
| matters other than blue books?
I'm beginning to wonder, for
Monday morning my long, olive
j drab, gaberdine raincoat was filched
! from a hook upstairs in the history
j building.
I have just returned to the cam-
I pus after an absence of six years,
j and during my four years of resi
dence prior to that time 1 have never
lost a single thing. I'm not drawing
I any conclusions about the decay oi
student morality since my day, bul
I'd like to have my overcoat pul
j back on that hook.
Ronald Anderson, '29
By tonight four coats probably
j will be waiting for you.â€”Ed.
