# MAKING ROOM FOR HONORARIES
## 
### 
I The Editor, Sir:
Yesterday afternoon, at the home
| of Dr. John Sellards, a tea was held
for members of the faculty and for
i graduate students in the Department
| of Romanic Languages. . . .
One of the topics brought up for
discussion at this l-eception was the
plan put forward by Pi Delta Phi.
In line v/ith the statement made
i recently by Comptroller Roth, to the
I effect that no work would be com
; menced on the new Memorial The-
I ater until all the groups which
might care to use the new building
j had submitted to him their requests
lor quarters and facilities, it was
suggested that all honorary frater
nities, sororities and other honor
societies should band together to se
cure an initiation place in the pro
jected theater.
Purposes of such a set-up are ob
vious: first, there is the desirability
of promoting the same type of mu
j tual-problem-discussion that has, in
■ recent years, been of benefit to va
rious living groups . . . ;secondly,
there is the legitimate grievance
; long held by various honor societies
on this campus that Stanford pro
vides no place where club func
tions only may be held, and that a
place like a department seminar
room or the basement of the Wom
en's Clubhouse is either too small,
too large, or not sufficiently formal
! in atmosphere.
Manifestly, a plan so far-reaching
and so inclusive demands full dis
! cussion. All persons who are con
i nected with any kind of honor so
ciety . . . should help with their
! suggestions.
