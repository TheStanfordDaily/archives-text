"SHE MARRIED HER BOSS"
At the California and
New Menlo Theaters
CClaudette Colbert's second
film for Columbia falls far
short of reaching the enter
tainment heights of her first
("It Happened One Night"). But it
will please ardent Colbert fans when
it gets down to business after slow,
inactive opening reels.
Efficient, business-like, Miss Col
best is the proverbial secretary who
marries her boss — for love, she
thinks; to straighten out his mad
household, he thinks. The story's
end proves both are right after a se
ries of mildly amusing, if highly
improbable incidents. "She Married
Her Boss" is at its best when
Claudette and Michael Bartlett be
come inebriated in a department
store window, rearrange the win

j dow's dummies in accordance with
their own fire-watered mood.
-—Botsford
The value of the buildings and
! grounds of Harvard, Columbia, and
Yale is well over $250,000,000.
