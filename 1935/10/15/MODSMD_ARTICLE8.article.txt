# Court Agrees To Try TVA In Test Case
## Georgia Hits Bankhead Cotton Act; Declares Unconstitutional 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 14 (/P). —
The Supreme Court agreed today to
measure the New Deal's farm and
Tennessee Valley programs by the
yardstick of the Constitution which
already has ruled out NRA.
In mapping a heavy schedule for
a potentially historic term the tri
bunal received simultaneously the
unprecedented action of a state at
tacking a Roosevelt administration
law. Georgia, whose governor Eu
gene Talmadge is a Roosevelt foe,
asked permission to challenge con
stitutionality of the Bankhead Cot
ton Control Act.
Consider Request
Chief Justice Hughes said the
Court would consider Georgia's re
quest. The tribunal agreed last
spring to review a Texas case in
volving the Bankhead Cotton Gin
ning Tax.
But of more immediate importance
to the Administration was the high
court's formal "consented" by which
it agreed to pass on the constitu
tionality of the AAA's legally-har
ried processing taxes. Should these
taxes be outlawed, President Roose
velt has indicated Congress may be
asked to levy new taxes to supply
the $500,000,000 estimated necessary
to fulfill existing benefit payment
contracts.
Power Sale Challenged
Involved in the TVA case was gov
ernmental sale of surplus power—a
keystone of the New Deal's policy
of setting up a government stand
ard for measuring private power
costs.
Both the AAA and TVA laws were
amended at the last session of Con
gress with the intention of bolstering
the statutes against constitutional
attacks.
Special note was taken of the AAA
amendments in a motion filed today
by the Washburn Crosby Company
of Kansas City which had obtained
a District Court judgment for re
covering processing taxes paid prior
to their enactment last August 24.
