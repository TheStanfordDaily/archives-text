ADDIS ABABA, Oct. 15 (/I 1 ). â€”
Italian bombing planes swooped
over strategic sections of Ethiopia
today while Emperor Haile Selassie
rallied his wild tribesmen to defense
of the empire.
Bombs were dropped by Fascist
planes on Alaji, near Makale, and
on troops at Makale, 60 miles south
of Aduwa, an official communique
said. It asserted there were no
casualties.
Natives Retreat
Ethiopians also announced scout
ing planes had passed over Gota, on
the railroad to Pjibouti, French
Somaliland, between Diredawa and
Awash. Still others of Premier
Mussolini's planes roared low over
Harar and nearly the entire popu
lace, badly frightened, fled into the
hills or to Diredawa.
Reports from Italian military
headquarters at Aduwa said Count
Galeazzo Ciano, son-in-iaw of Mus
solini, and two other pilots of his
"death or glory" squadron flew south
of Hakale and bombed an Ethiopian
ammunition dump, drawing rifle fire
but escaping unscathed.
Whites Periled
When the planes flew over Harar
today, Americans and other foreign
ers abandoned their hotels and
sought refuge in the compound of
the British Consulate on a suburban
hillside. British and French consuls
advised all white residents of Harar
to go to Addis Ababa or to Diredawa.
A shipment of 30,000 foreign
rifles arrived at Jijiga today follow
ing upon action of the League of
Nations in lifting an embargo
against this country.
While the Italian fclanes struck
feai in border sections, Haile Se
lassie sent out huge contingents of
warriors to key points to meet ex
pected Italian attack from both
north and south.
