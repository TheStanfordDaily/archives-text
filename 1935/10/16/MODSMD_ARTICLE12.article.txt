ALEXANDRIA, Egypt, Oct. 15
(A'). â€”Rear Admiral Sir William
Fisher, sole dictator of Egypt's first
line of defense, directed today the
biggest naval maneuvers yet held off
the shores of this ancient kingdom,
as Egyptian politicians intensified
their violent protests against being
"tied to Great Britain's apron
strings."
While the political situation seem
ed rapidly drawing to a head with
Premier Tewfik Nesshim Pasha de
scribed in the press as the "puppet
and tool of Britain," for not insisting
on Egypt's right to speak for itself
in the matter of sanctions {'gainst
Italy, Admiral Fisher took out the
British capital ships for the first
time to participate in combined
maneuvers with smaller craft.
