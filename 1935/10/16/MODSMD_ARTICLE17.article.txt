# Neff Suspends Rowdy Coeds
## 
### 
WACO, Tex., Oct. 14
dent Pat M. Neff of Baylor Univer
sity, who recently disciplined three
co-eds for smoking, dismissed three
others outright today for what he
termed "the good of the university"
and "unbecoming conduct."
The former governor of Texas—
now in his fourth year as head of
the Baptist institution — read the
young women's names 'at chapel.
They were not present.
"Taking an action like this saps
every ounce of my energy and nat
urally I regret to have to take it,"
he said later, "but my loyalty to
Baylor demands that I do so." Neff
is a Baylor graduate.
The three co-eds are Vera L.
Gorin, Waco, sophomore, whom he
asked to retire for the "good of the
university"; and Ennie Lilly DeWitt
Ballinger, and Elnor Louise Wink
ler Moody, indefinitely suspended,
he said, for "conduct unbecoming
Baylor students."
