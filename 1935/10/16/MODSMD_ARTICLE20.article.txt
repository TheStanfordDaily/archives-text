KANSAS CITY, Oct. 15 (/I 1 ). —
Many a glamorous chorus girl has a
higher intelligence quotient than the
average college graduate, Albert
Edward Wiggam, psychologist, said
today—but she doesn't have enough
children.
"The very gorgeous young women
who should be producing beautiful,
intelligent children haven't the time
for motherhood because they are in
demand at night clubs, before the
movie camera and on the stage."
"Dorothy Wegman, a Ziegfeld
chorus girl, had an I.Q. of 166.
Georgette Moore, who was cast in
'Great Temptations' had 167. Kay
English, another Ziegfeld beauty,
had 168. And Edith Davis of 'Naugh
ty Riquette' had 184.
"Yet it was found that 800 chorus
girls produced a total of only 25
: children. There are 1,800 women in
Who's Who. They average about
one child apiece. At that rate, with
in six generations they will be en
tirely extinct."
