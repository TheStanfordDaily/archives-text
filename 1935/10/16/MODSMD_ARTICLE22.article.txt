# Stanford's Soldiers
## Stanford's Soldiers Prepared for War 
### 
War anywhere, even in a place as !
remote as eastern Africa, puts War
Department officials in Washington
on the edge of their chairs. But to
day, unlike 1917, the United States i
Army is prepared on the shortest
notice to efficiently and completely
mobilize American men.
Most potent vertebrae in this
system's backbone is the Reserve
Officers' Training Corps, operated in
colleges and universities throughout
the country. Rated as high as any
is the Stanford field artillery unit.
Military training at Stanford dates
back to 1892 when a retired army of- !
j ficer organized a course in military
| tactics. Interest in the training soon
I lagged and classes were discontin
j ued. A private university, Stanford
i was not required by the government
to establish a military unit, but in
; 1916 the University formed an in- 1
I fantry unit which furnished over 500
officers and enlisted men to the
United States war forces.
After the war, Congress amended
i the National Defense Act to create
the R.O.T.C. A voluntary field ar
| tillery, ordnance, and infantry unit
J was formed ut the Farm. Later in

fantry training was dropped to place
emphasis on field artillery, for which
Stanford was best fitted by climate
and location.
Today Stanford's unit, with the ex
ception of Oregon State's is the only
field artillery post in the west. En
rolled in the unit are 310 men, of
whom 98 are receiving advanced in
struction with government pay.
Ranked by Captain H. Y. Grubbs,
polo coach, as the best government
animals at any post in the country,
84 horses play polo, draw guns and
caissons, and are ridden by student
soldiers. Ten cannon, four 1917
model trucks, one tank, and five 5-
ton tractors are included in the mili
tary department's equipment. Five
regular army officers instruct cadets
and administer the post's business,
stationed here by the government
are 20 enlisted men.
No one who knows big, genial
Lieutenant-Colonel B. R. Peyton,
the unit's commanding officer, could
believe that he is anxious to prepare
men for death on the battlefield.
The purpose of the R.O.T.C. is not
to create blood-thirsty war fever
but to build a national defense sys
tem strong enough to prevent war.

colleges and universities throughout
the country. Rated as high as any
is the Stanford field artillery unit.
Military training at Stanford dates
back to 1892 when a retired army of- !
j ficer organized a course in military
| tactics. Interest in the training soon
I lagged and classes were discontin
j ued. A private university, Stanford
i was not required by the government
to establish a military unit, but in
; 1916 the University formed an in- 1
I fantry unit which furnished over 500
officers and enlisted men to the
United States war forces.
After the war, Congress amended
i the National Defense Act to create
the R.O.T.C. A voluntary field ar
| tillery, ordnance, and infantry unit
J was formed ut the Farm. Later in

fantry training was dropped to place
emphasis on field artillery, for which
Stanford was best fitted by climate
and location.
Today Stanford's unit, with the ex
ception of Oregon State's is the only
field artillery post in the west. En
rolled in the unit are 310 men, of
whom 98 are receiving advanced in
struction with government pay.
Ranked by Captain H. Y. Grubbs,
polo coach, as the best government
animals at any post in the country,
84 horses play polo, draw guns and
caissons, and are ridden by student
soldiers. Ten cannon, four 1917
model trucks, one tank, and five 5-
ton tractors are included in the mili
tary department's equipment. Five
regular army officers instruct cadets
and administer the post's business,
stationed here by the government
are 20 enlisted men.
No one who knows big, genial
Lieutenant-Colonel B. R. Peyton,
the unit's commanding officer, could
believe that he is anxious to prepare
men for death on the battlefield.
The purpose of the R.O.T.C. is not
to create blood-thirsty war fever
but to build a national defense sys
tem strong enough to prevent war.
War anywhere, even in a place as !
remote as eastern Africa, puts War
Department officials in Washington
on the edge of their chairs. But to
day, unlike 1917, the United States i
Army is prepared on the shortest
notice to efficiently and completely
mobilize American men.
Most potent vertebrae in this
system's backbone is the Reserve
Officers' Training Corps, operated in
colleges and universities throughout
the country. Rated as high as any
is the Stanford field artillery unit.
