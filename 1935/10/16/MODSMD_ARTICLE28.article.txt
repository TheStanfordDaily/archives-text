# Election Slated To Fill Vacant Graduate Post
## Stark Quits as Ex Committee Representative; Jack Hanson Will Fill Post Until New Man Is Elected in November 
### 
RESIGNATION of Bill Stark as graduate man on Ex Committee, an
nounced last night, resulted in the setting of a special election for early
in November. Jack Hanson, runner-up, will he member pro tern until
that date.
Stark reported that he tried to withdraw, but was unable to submit
his declination before election time. Dean Marion Kirkwood, legal ad-

viser, ruled that an election must be
held, but could be postponed until
the already planned frosh elections.
STANFORD RINGS, adopted ten
tatively last spring, will not be an
official A.S.S.U. project, decided Ex
Committee. "The amount we would
have to pay to control manufacture
of the ring is not commensurate
with demand," demurred Bob Gros.
"Let's not go into the jewelry busi
ness, Wally," pleaded Adrienne
Johnston. Ex Committee assented.
The ring will remain unofficial.
STUDENT GUIDE, a framed list
of campus numbers surrounded by
ads which would be placed in liv
ing groups, was approved tenta
tively. The sheet would be pub
lished weekly and contain current
shows, merchants' specials, and pay
10 per cent of net profits into A.S.
S.U. coffers.
Editor Bob Jones protested that it
would cut into Daily advertising.
The measure, if okeyed by Manager
A1 Masters, will come up next week
for final decision.
MINUTES of Rally Committee and
Cardinals were passed without
question. Members were gleeful
over the financial return netted by
the post-U.C.L.A. game dance. "They
made over $100, but the punch was
lousy," commented Gros.
DATES GRANTED included No
vember 2 for a Cardinal dance in
honor of Santa Clara. Phi Phi, Tri
Dell, and the Union radio dance
were set for the same night.
Other dates included Class of '38
jolly-up, October 17; Class of '37
jolly-up, October 23; Alpha Phi and
Chi Omega house dances; Kappa
Sigma, November 15; Toyon 5 to fi
o'clock open house Big Game day;
Scabbard and Blade closed date,
February 28; and spring quarter
registration dance, Y.W.C.A. A move
to have all reg dances A.S.S.U.-
sponsored was defeated.
APPOINTMENTS included John
Cahill as Red Cross Drive chairman.
"The drive has an added attraction,"
offered Brooke. "This year you can
mark contributions to the Interna
tional Ethiopian Fund."
Elsie Lillard was named as wom
an member of the Student Aid
Committee, and Maxwell Snow as
polo manager.
COUPON BOOKS do not concern
Ex Committee. That was decided
when Brooke pointed out that thoy
are not run by students and merely
involve a question of merchandising
I ethics.
COLORED MOVfES of Stanford
life, made at a cost of $350 and ap- j
proved by Alumni Secretary Harlow
Rothert and Comptroller Almon E. j
*
Roth, will be fine things for high
school assemblies. Such films would
be permissible, ethical, and laudable, ;
said members.
TRANSPORTATION to U.S.C., j
said Bob Gros, has caused concern
on the parts of President Wilbur,
Dean Mary Yost, and Women's Con- I
ference. Gros agreed that no liquor
would be served "because, besides
the moral aspect, who wants to pay
S.P. prices?" He is authorized to
choose an official Stanford hotel and
get special rates for students S.C.
game week-end.
INTERCOLLEGIATE FORUM
will be managed by Brooke, Jean
Anderson, and Sterling Cottrell, in
collaboration with delegates from
coast colleges.
HYMN SINGING should improve,
suggested Daily Editor Jones. "Teach
Roble and Encina—get 'em while
they're young," contributed Frank
Fullenwider. "Have the Cardinals
conduct a living group contest," said
Sterling Cottrell. "Have the song j
printed and distributed," consid
ered Helen Grover. Six other ideas
followed. "There you are, Bob," re
marked Brooke complacently. "Take
your choice."
Ex Committee morale, bolstered |
two weeks ago by Brooke's offering
of candy and cigarettes, reached a
new high when Gros arrived with
peanuts and Congressional Records.
"This," stressed Gros, "is not a j
bribe."

The measure, if okeyed by Manager
A1 Masters, will come up next week
for final decision.
MINUTES of Rally Committee and
Cardinals were passed without
question. Members were gleeful
over the financial return netted by
the post-U.C.L.A. game dance. "They
made over $100, but the punch was
lousy," commented Gros.
DATES GRANTED included No
vember 2 for a Cardinal dance in
honor of Santa Clara. Phi Phi, Tri
Dell, and the Union radio dance
were set for the same night.
Other dates included Class of '38
jolly-up, October 17; Class of '37
jolly-up, October 23; Alpha Phi and
Chi Omega house dances; Kappa
Sigma, November 15; Toyon 5 to fi
o'clock open house Big Game day;
Scabbard and Blade closed date,
February 28; and spring quarter
registration dance, Y.W.C.A. A move
to have all reg dances A.S.S.U.-
sponsored was defeated.
APPOINTMENTS included John
Cahill as Red Cross Drive chairman.
"The drive has an added attraction,"
offered Brooke. "This year you can
mark contributions to the Interna
tional Ethiopian Fund."
Elsie Lillard was named as wom
an member of the Student Aid
Committee, and Maxwell Snow as
polo manager.
COUPON BOOKS do not concern
Ex Committee. That was decided
when Brooke pointed out that thoy
are not run by students and merely
involve a question of merchandising
I ethics.
COLORED MOVfES of Stanford
life, made at a cost of $350 and ap- j
proved by Alumni Secretary Harlow
Rothert and Comptroller Almon E. j
*
Roth, will be fine things for high
school assemblies. Such films would
be permissible, ethical, and laudable, ;
said members.
TRANSPORTATION to U.S.C., j
said Bob Gros, has caused concern
on the parts of President Wilbur,
Dean Mary Yost, and Women's Con- I
ference. Gros agreed that no liquor
would be served "because, besides
the moral aspect, who wants to pay
S.P. prices?" He is authorized to
choose an official Stanford hotel and
get special rates for students S.C.
game week-end.
INTERCOLLEGIATE FORUM
will be managed by Brooke, Jean
Anderson, and Sterling Cottrell, in
collaboration with delegates from
coast colleges.
HYMN SINGING should improve,
suggested Daily Editor Jones. "Teach
Roble and Encina—get 'em while
they're young," contributed Frank
Fullenwider. "Have the Cardinals
conduct a living group contest," said
Sterling Cottrell. "Have the song j
printed and distributed," consid
ered Helen Grover. Six other ideas
followed. "There you are, Bob," re
marked Brooke complacently. "Take
your choice."
Ex Committee morale, bolstered |
two weeks ago by Brooke's offering
of candy and cigarettes, reached a
new high when Gros arrived with
peanuts and Congressional Records.
"This," stressed Gros, "is not a j
bribe."
RESIGNATION of Bill Stark as graduate man on Ex Committee, an
nounced last night, resulted in the setting of a special election for early
in November. Jack Hanson, runner-up, will he member pro tern until
that date.
Stark reported that he tried to withdraw, but was unable to submit
his declination before election time. Dean Marion Kirkwood, legal ad-

viser, ruled that an election must be
held, but could be postponed until
the already planned frosh elections.
STANFORD RINGS, adopted ten
tatively last spring, will not be an
official A.S.S.U. project, decided Ex
Committee. "The amount we would
have to pay to control manufacture
of the ring is not commensurate
with demand," demurred Bob Gros.
"Let's not go into the jewelry busi
ness, Wally," pleaded Adrienne
Johnston. Ex Committee assented.
The ring will remain unofficial.
STUDENT GUIDE, a framed list
of campus numbers surrounded by
ads which would be placed in liv
ing groups, was approved tenta
tively. The sheet would be pub
lished weekly and contain current
shows, merchants' specials, and pay
10 per cent of net profits into A.S.
S.U. coffers.
Editor Bob Jones protested that it
would cut into Daily advertising.
