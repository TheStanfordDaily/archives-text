CHICAGO, Oct. 15 (/P).â€”Radio
news broadcasts were described by
J. A. Swan and Forrest Geneva of
the Register and Tribune of Des
Moines, lowa, today as aids and not
rivals of the newspapers. They spoke
before the Newspaper Advertising
Executive Association.
The public appetite for news is
whetted by the radio flashes, and
circulation rises as a result, Swan
and Geneva said.
