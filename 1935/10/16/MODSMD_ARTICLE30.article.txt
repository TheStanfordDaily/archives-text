# Stage Settings For Wagnerian Drama Pictured
## Reinhardt Lectures On S.F. Opera Scenes 
### 
"Wagner was not only a great
composer, but he was also a great
artist much in advance of his own
day," said Dr. Kurt F. Reinhardt,
associate professor of Germanic
languages, in his second lecture on
"The Staging of Richard Wagner's
Ring" last evening.
Early Sets Simple
Illustrating his lecture with slides
of settings by famous designers, Dr.
Reinhardt included scenes by Hoff
man, Ruckner, and Appia. These
were simple, following Wagner's
own ideals.
Appia especially realized the ar
tistic and dramatic values of light
and shade in direct contrast to the
ornate settings of the late Renais
sance.
"In the Niebelungenlied, the set
ting becomes a real actor for the first
time in stagecraft," Dr. Reinhardt
said as he explained that even the
elements of Nature—fire and water,
are called into action.
"Light Drama's Core"
"Wagner's ideals cannot be car
ried out by using the antiquated me
chanics of his own day, but design
ers must use the newest of machin
ists' arts. Light, in its most modern
sense, is the core of the drama."
In showing the settings designed
by Julian Dove for the performance
in the San Francisco Opera House,
Dr. Reinhardt explained that they
struck a middle path between the
technique of Wagner's time and
more modern trends.
