# U.C. Polo Meet Called Toss-up
## Indians Don't Rate Over Berkeley Bears 
### 
I For the first time in his 23 years
i of water polo competition, the Stan
ford Indian will not be favored to
track down the Berkeley Bear in the
tilt set for Saturday morning at 11
o'clock.
The game, from all indications,
will be a toss-up. If past records
i are indicative, however, the Cardi-
I nals have a slight edge over the
Californians, for to Stanford's credit
have gone 29 victories since the lirst
] game in 1912 as compared to the
Bears' single victory during the
, same period.
It was only last year that Cali
fornia won the first game of the
series only to lose the final tilt and
the conference title to the Indians by
a 7-5 score.
This year, on the other hand,
California and Stanford are tied as
the leaders in the Pacific Association
league, neither having dropped any
games. And inasmuch as Saturday's
battle marks the opening of the
current race for the conference title,
both squads are out for blood.
As a preliminary' to Saturday's
varsity clash, the Farm frosh will
meet the Bear Cubs. Here again
Stanford is doped to come out on
the short end of the final score.
A robot-like machine has been in
stalled in the registrar's office of the
University of Texas to save the stu
-1 dents' time as well as the registrar's.
