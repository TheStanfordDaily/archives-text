IT'S HARD
TO BELIEVE
It's hard to realize that stocky
Frank Alustiza won't ever walk out
of a Stanford huddle, shift into his
flanking post at half, wheel, reverse
across the backfield, and crash into
the line. That Stanford won't have
his quick kicking, his perfect block
ing, his driving runs.
It's hard to believe that "Owl
Eyes" is grounded for good. For
in Frank Alustiza Stanford had
what every team needs—a steady,
hard-hitting, halfback.
Stanford hates to lose Frankie and
at the same time Stanford is unxious
that he be left with no permanent
injury as the result of one fateful
drive at the U.C.L.A. line last Sat
urday.
Latest word of Alustiza's injury
describes it as a probable detached
retina, explainable in the layman's
language as follows:
A sharp blow received on the side
of the head would cause a hem
horrage behind the retina, or focus
ing screen under the eye. The
loosed blood forms a so-called
"blood blister" under the retina,
forcing it away from the original
seat.
Thus the eye will fail to focus
when light strikes that point of the
retina, and that condition will re
main until the blister disappears.
Doctors are assuring that Alus
tiza's eye will regain normalcy
within a few days. But they are
explicit in their statements that
if Frank should ever receive an
other such blow, eyesight might
he permanently impaired.
So Frankie is through with the
gridiron for good, but he's left an
everlasting impression in the history
of Stanford football.
FROM THE
BOTTOM LP, NOW
Four days ago Stanford was on
the top. There was everything te
lose and nothing to gain. Stanford
was exuberant for ahead loomed
the brightest football season that
present Farm generations could re
member.
Today the situation is exactly
reversed. Stanford has every
thing to gain and nothing to lose.
At least it can he hoped that noth
ing more will be lost.
But the fact that everything has
gone topsy-turvy these last few days
and Stanford is back near the bot
tom looking up. still does not mean
the cause is lost.
That very fact may help to keep
the loss rate from increasing. For
Stanford to outsiders is no longer
the highly-touted ball club of the
Pacific. Stanford is a beaten team,
weakened by the loss of one of its
most valuable men.
For that reason, Stanford starting
again at scratch, again able to work
the underdog gag, may still pull the
1935 season out of the proverbial
fire.
In that way all the misfortune

| that's fallen upon Stanford's foot
j ball hopes since last Friday will
1 help counteract its evil effects in
' two ways at least.
First it will take Stanford out of
! the central spotlight enough to give
1 her a chance to play more as an
I every day football team and not as
! the unequalled Indians.
Second it will make Stanford re
! alize that if anything is to come
{ out of a season that started on top,
| she will have to display the same
I spirit, the same desire for victory
j that was seen when the "Sopho
j more Sensations started their work
'way back in 1932. —Frost
