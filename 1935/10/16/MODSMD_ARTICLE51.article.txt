# Movie Eye Sees Blow That Finished Alustiza
## 
### GORDON FROST 
The blow that has put Frankie
I Alustiza out of Stanford football
was spotted easily last night as Tiny
! Thornhill's gridmen watched their
i own actions Saturday as captured
• by the movie camera.
It occurred in the middle of
the third quarter when Frank
took the ball on single wing for
mation and ran a cutback inside
of right end. He was tackled by
two Uclan players after a gain
| of eight or ten yards and fell
heavily.
Then Olson, Bruin right tackle,
| evidently afraid that Alustiza would
roll loose, fell upon the downed ball
, player, his knee knocking Frank's
! helmet off. It appeared that either
I Olson's shin or shoe then struck
i Alustiza's bare temple the blow thai
! ended a brilliant grid career.
The play can be remembered
j without much difficulty. It was dis
| tinguishable because Alustiza's hel
met rolled at least 12 feet clear of
the pile-up, spectators believing for
an instant that it was a fumbled ball.
The pictures, shown to team
members at the B.A.C. last night
| as constructive criticism, revealed
i Grayson's brilliant play even
more obviously than did the game

itself. In slow motion his ability
to burst through seemingly im
passable defense and slice through
the most minute holes, appeared
almost uncanny.
But, as a whole, it was a mighty
unpleasant show for the Indians.
Every fault stood out clearly and
when a pass flicked the end of a
prospective receiver's fingers, it was
almost as bad for the fellows as the
real thing that took place four days
ago.
When the shot of Alustiza's injury
was run and re-run several times
for complete identification a pall of
gloom hung over the group.
Finally, the thought that lived in
every man's mind came forth from
one—"Let's not see that again."
