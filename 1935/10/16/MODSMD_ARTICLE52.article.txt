# Post-Rain Practice For Poloists Today
## 
### 
After a short lay-off due to the
inclement weather, Captain Haydon
Grubbs stated that Indian polo men
return to practice this afternoon,
barring cut-ups by old man Pluvius.
If the field has dried out suffi
ciently to insure a safe footing for
the mounts, Grubbs will put the
team through ball and stick work in
preparation for the initial scrim
mage, postponed from last Friday,
to be played between the first and
second stringers on the highway
field Friday afternoon.
