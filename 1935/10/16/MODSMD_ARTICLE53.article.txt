# Alustiza '100 Per Cent' Better
## 'Bones' Still Suffers From Hurt Muscle Jimmy Coffis, Joe Vigna At Halfback; Grayson, Paulman Back 
### Warren Breed 
Although Dr. Fritz Roth has or- j
dered Frankie Alustiza never to play '
football again, the actual condition j
of the bashing Basque's injured eye
was reported "just twice as good" (
as it was Monday.
Monday half of the retinal plate j
was affected by the blood clot that j
causes the trouble. Yesterday Dr. :
Gordon Smith of Palo Alto made
further inspection and found that ,
cnly half of the half that was bad j
was still bad, all of which leaves \
Frankie's eye three-quarters sound, j
Hamilton Still Out
Frankie's partner at halfback,
Bones Hamilton, was also missed at
practice last night. No one is sure
when the sturdy Number 29 will be
back in shape.
In the U.C.L.A. game he was con
centrating so hard on sparing his
ailing arch that he left other mem
bers wide open to injury; the up
shot is that a muscle in his leg was
badly strained.
CofTis, Vigna Fill In
So Tiny had Jimmy Coffis and Joe i
Vigna filling in at the halfback
berths. Both are good at squirming
through tackle, but with Alustiza
and Hamilton out, the old 12-threat
backfield is no more, a good deal of
the extra burden of the backfield
chores falling upon Bobby Grayson
and Quarterback Bill Paulman.
With Coffis and Vigna now regu
lars, at least for the present, Johnny
Reisner, Tom Collins, Glenn Ham
ilton, Fred Williams, Johnny Camp
bell, Leo Madlem, and Ray Todd will
also get that much more chance to
see some action.
Schott, Trompas in Line-up
On the first string yesterday with
Coffis and Vigna were Carl Schott
and Alex Trompas, ends. Reason:
Keith Topping and Monk Moscrip
are not up to par yet, their great
games against U.C.L.A. having ren
dered them unable to keep up the
pace.
The University of North Carolina
celebrated 142 years of progress last
Friday.
