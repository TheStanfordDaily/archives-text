# "Let the Winds of Freedom Blow"
## Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily Member of the Associated Press Student Opposition to Hitler Should Not Take Form of Olympic Boycott 
### 
The editor of The Campus, student publi
cation of the College of the City of New York,
in a letter yesterday asked the Daily to co
operate with him in a nation-wide campaign
against American participation in the 19« M
Olympics in Berlin.
The New York editor favors boycotting the
Olympics on the grounds that it "will voice
the opposition of the American college stu
dent to Hitlerism and all that it connotes."
Assuming this American anti-Nazi campaign
to be advisable, the question arises: Would
the boycott's injurious cll'ect on the Games
themselves be compensated for by this mere
expression of disapproval of Hitlerism?
The Olympics, in the past, have never been
a political undertaking. The International
Federation of Amateur Athletes, which acts
as the governing board for the Games, makes
all of its rulings without heed to race, religion,
or nationality. The I.N.F. has a code'of fair
conduct that sounds the very keynote of ama
teurism and sportsmanship. Because of this,
the Olympic governing board has succeeded
in keeping the Games on a plane above petty
political diU'erences that pervade every other
form of international relations.
The extensive preparations Nazi Germany
has already begun indicate that she is so in
terested in the Olympics that she will not fur
ther iin peril their success by officially dis
criminating against race or religion in either

the selection of her own team or that of any
visitor.
In the first place, the (lames will need pub
licity; hence, Germany must permit American
scribes to cover every angle of the Olympics.
With these reporters watching Nazi prepara
tions, it is improbable that there will be any
display of discrimination.
Regarding visiting teams, German accept
ance of the responsibility of the Gaines places
her in a position where she must cordially
receive any athlete a visiting nation chooses to
send. The possibility of any official discrimi
nation here is too fantastic to bear serious
consideration.
Another column of today's Daily raises the
question of the importance of "unofficial
prejudice" Nazi followers might hold. Assum
ing that this prejudice will be noticeable, it
will be no more apparent than a similar racial
or religious prejudice would be in nearly any
other country.
• L'p till now, the Olympic Games have been
kept free from political differences; they have
been open to every racial, national, and reli
gious minority in every patricipating country.
If the voicing of American college students'
opposition to Hitlerism is deemed necessary,
it should be done in some direct manner, and
not by "cutting oil' our nose to spite our face,"
as would be the case if the United States boy
cotted the 1930 Olympics.

Olympics in Berlin.
The New York editor favors boycotting the
Olympics on the grounds that it "will voice
the opposition of the American college stu
dent to Hitlerism and all that it connotes."
Assuming this American anti-Nazi campaign
to be advisable, the question arises: Would
the boycott's injurious cll'ect on the Games
themselves be compensated for by this mere
expression of disapproval of Hitlerism?
The Olympics, in the past, have never been
a political undertaking. The International
Federation of Amateur Athletes, which acts
as the governing board for the Games, makes
all of its rulings without heed to race, religion,
or nationality. The I.N.F. has a code'of fair
conduct that sounds the very keynote of ama
teurism and sportsmanship. Because of this,
the Olympic governing board has succeeded
in keeping the Games on a plane above petty
political diU'erences that pervade every other
form of international relations.
The extensive preparations Nazi Germany
has already begun indicate that she is so in
terested in the Olympics that she will not fur
ther iin peril their success by officially dis
criminating against race or religion in either

the selection of her own team or that of any
visitor.
In the first place, the (lames will need pub
licity; hence, Germany must permit American
scribes to cover every angle of the Olympics.
With these reporters watching Nazi prepara
tions, it is improbable that there will be any
display of discrimination.
Regarding visiting teams, German accept
ance of the responsibility of the Gaines places
her in a position where she must cordially
receive any athlete a visiting nation chooses to
send. The possibility of any official discrimi
nation here is too fantastic to bear serious
consideration.
Another column of today's Daily raises the
question of the importance of "unofficial
prejudice" Nazi followers might hold. Assum
ing that this prejudice will be noticeable, it
will be no more apparent than a similar racial
or religious prejudice would be in nearly any
other country.
• L'p till now, the Olympic Games have been
kept free from political differences; they have
been open to every racial, national, and reli
gious minority in every patricipating country.
If the voicing of American college students'
opposition to Hitlerism is deemed necessary,
it should be done in some direct manner, and
not by "cutting oil' our nose to spite our face,"
as would be the case if the United States boy
cotted the 1930 Olympics.
The editor of The Campus, student publi
cation of the College of the City of New York,
in a letter yesterday asked the Daily to co
operate with him in a nation-wide campaign
against American participation in the 19« M
Olympics in Berlin.
