# Daily vs. Faculty — Case Dismissed
## 
### 
Half-hearted response met the Daily's chal
lenge to the faculty to put out one complete
issue of the A.S.S.U.'s paper to see what was
involved in the job.
The faculty found itself to be 100 busy for
such pastimes. Besides, it graciously added,
the Daily wasn't half bad —a novel criticism
in view of the somewhat more violent ones
often bandied about, in classrooms and out.
Reluctantly, the Daily admits that it might
not have been such a practical idea. Even so,
a faculty number might afford good clean fun
for all involved. With the Political Science
department handling A.P., the English de
partment writing features, the administration
working on edits, and one of the more whim
sical professors drolling through an "Our
Hasher Sez," some startling results might
have been noted.
Next time one of the Daily's sterner critics
feels moved to jump down the former's throat,
he might remember that he had his chance,
and that any enterprising professor is at any
time welcome to drop around to the office,
revive the idea, and organize his colleagues
into a Daily stall' for one issue.
