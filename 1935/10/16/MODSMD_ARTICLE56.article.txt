# Safety Takes Precedence Over Give-a-Lift Tradition
## 
### 
(iordy Davis' announced policy of giving
citations to all drivers with overcrowded cars
inaugurates a new campus-wide safety drive

that has been made necessary by this year's
increased number of student-owned cars.
Farm trallic regulators in the future will
work on the theory that three's a crowd : four's
100 many. This sudden "cracking-down" is
prompted by several recent acidents resulting
directly or indirectly from running - board
riders.
Police insist that over - crowded cars ob
struct the drivers' vision and invariably are a
menace to operating elliciencv. Men's and
Women's Councils have announced their in
tention of abetting strict traffic regulation by
levying steep lines on all drivers cited on this
charge by campus police.
The tightening of trallic enforcement ma
chinery, although it may seem to work a hard
ship on the Hough who is anxious to uphold
tradition by "giving a lift" to one too many
student pedestrians, is essential on Stanford's
network of none-too-safe campus roads.
Death or serious injury from auto accidents
has hit an average of more than one Stanford
student every year during the past decade.
Increased campus road congestion might eas
ily boost this number if trallic regulations
were not enforced with increased vigor.
