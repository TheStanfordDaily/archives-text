Many have been the historic wrangles between The
Daily and the student manager, but this is the first
time an outsider has tried to take the paper over.
The editor of Stanford's only home-town paper re
ceived a letter from a New York newspaper broker.
"Dear Sir:
"A good client desires to purchase for cash a Cali
fornia daily paper.
"If you are willing to sell, please fill in, sign, and
return to me the enclosed questionnaire.
"Yours for business,
J. B. Shale
"P.S. If for any reason you do not wish to sell,
please return the questionnaire."
Several people who gambled heavily on Satur
day's Punch Bowl game likewise lost heavily. The
over-confident chapter of Phi Kappa Sigma wagered
with the U.C.L.A. chapter, the loser to furnish a wall
trophy to the winner. The local house manager is
busy collecting funds from the members, whose pock
ctbooks have atrophied in the meantime.
Also losers were scholars who offered to do 10 pages
of assignment if we won and 20 if we lost. The scholars
thought it was a cinch. But they woke up Sunday
morning with the awful realization that they were
horsed scholars.
Near rioting and bloodshed gripped that hot-bed of
Gummunism—Encina Hall—Saturday night. It started
this way:
A freshman asked the sponsors' permission to show
his U.C.L.A. darling the etchings in his room. The
request was granted with the condition that a sponsor
be present while the art exhibit was in progress.
About 11:30 o'clock Saturday night the freshman
decided to throw open the doors of the salon, but it
seems that three additional couples had attached them
selves to the party, and no sponsor had turned up for
the intellectual feast.
"Ah, we are alone at last," said the exhibitor, as
he opened the massive doors. But he was mistaken.
A look-out had spotted the party. A cry went up that
echoed up and down the corridors—"Women in the
Hall!" From the fifth floor down to the very bowels
of the hostelry, a flood of humanity poured forth.
Future chem majors, psych majors, physics majors,
scholars, gentlemen, and athletes came pounding out
into the halls. In various stages of disarray they
came. Some with bathrobes, some without bathrobes,
some with shorts, some without shorts, but all intent
on following the Pied Pipers.
The Pied Pipers, not knowing what else to do, took
out in a wild flight for the salon. But the time they
had arrived at the second landing, "they found the vigi
lante committee holding a mass meeting. Dejected
and disgusted .the Pied Pipers turned around, left
the hall and decided to etch elsewhere.
