## CAN GERMANY PLAY SQUARE? 
### 
Hitler's "G" men, Goebbels and Goering, are on
the trail of Germany's "public enemies," not only its
A1 Capones—Einstein and Thomas Mann—but also on
its "small fry," German-Jewish and Catholic youth.
They are segregated in German schools, discrim
inated against on the theory that the existence of
the German state depends on their elimination not
only as potential political factors, but also as social
and professional ones.
Yet Hitler, between restrictive manifestos, has
guaranteed the Olympic Games Committee that he
will not discriminate racially against non-Aryan
German entrant in the Berlin festival next year.
That guarantee has been deemed "reasonable as
surance" by the Stanford Daily.
# * # *
The question of whether German officials can prom
ise, in one governmental function among many, that
they will completely disregard official Nazi policies,
has been totally forgotten.
To that question there is one obvious answer.
Despite the answer approval of the New York A.A.U.
of American participation in the Olympics makes
further protest futile. The games seem destined to go
on as scheduled, with world-wide participation based
on a "guarantee" of non-discrimination offered by the
most vicious race-haters of Germany.
♦ ♦ * *
Even assuming, for the moment, that the German
Olympics Committee will make an honest effort to pick
entrants regardless of race, that no "official" prejudice
will sway decisions anywhere along the line of selec
tion, just how much of a factor is the unofficial preju
dice, the personal attitude of the individual German
leaders, and of their followers?
In every society, individual racial attitude is a
variable. It is something that cannot be guaranteed
into non-existence. After a German official has rigged
himself into a high frenzy over race purity and the
odious character of races he chooses to eliminate, can
he clear his mind by wiping it with a piece of paper?
That is another question, like the first once, can
also have only one answer.
