I)o you favor a post-season
game with an eastern team?
WKS MULLER, center: "I guess I
differ from everybody else on that
question. Although I would enjoy
the trip itself, I can sec the disad
vantages also. When a fellow takes
five labs a week there is the possi
bility of getting behind."
AL MASTERS, general manager
of the 8.A.C.: "It all depends on
whom we played. If we could get a
good opponent, I would favor such
a game."
MONK MOSCRIP, all-American
end: "I would vote for it. Although
I live in New York and have been
back many times, an eastern trip is
deserved by all the fellows on the
team, and it would give us a chance
to show those eastern sports writers
just what kind of a team we have."
