DISAGREEMENT among the re- I

j Her Boss" was a good picture, wor
thy of more than the "C" rating it, j
j got in The Daily. Although not as I
good as "It Happened One Night,"
which it attempted to imitate, it was
still a darned good show.
LEOPOLD STOKOWSKI will
: take his Philadelphia Symphony Or- j
j chestra on a five-week nation-wide i
tour next spring, under the sponsor- ]
ship of RCA. Most dales will be i
one-night stands, with Los Angeles 1
| getting two days and San Francisco
three. (Take that, you Southern
Californians!)
STANFORD SUCCESS: Vallejo
j Gantner, former president of Sword J
and Sandals and originator of their i
unique form of play readings, is to
appear as Canio in a "dramatic ar
rangement" of "Pagliacci" in Los
Angeles on October 25. Gantner,
| after leaving Stanford, played with
the Theater Guild in New York and
was highly successful as the villain
in the San Francisco company of
"The Drunkai'd." His most recent
! activity was in dubbing sound for
j certain of the scenes of Cecil De-
Mille's "Crusades."
ATTEMPTED SUCCESS: Among
Stanford thespians of recent years
now seeking fame in New York are
Annelies Morgan, Shelley Smith,
Mary Liles, Amelia Baines, James
Benet, James Broughton, and Neal
Berry. Robert Balzer is at the Royal
Academy in London. Your Reviewer
hazards the guess that of them all.
Morgan is the best, while Liles,
Benet, and Balzer all have possibili
j ties.
MATHEMATICAL FACT: Why
do they speak of the improved 1100?
As far as we can see, 1100 is just
2 1/5 times 500.
