# ON TO VICTORY

The Editor, Sir:
Unless someone takes steps im
mediately, some poor soul will get
lost in the fog of gloom that is hang
ing over this campus.
Simply because Stanford lost a
tough game and a football player,
there is no reason to think the In
dians are through. No one on this
campus took a harder blow than
Frankie Alustiza. . . .
If he can take it as he will, what
is the matter with us, the great mass
of undergrads who should be back
ing the team to the limit if it didn't
score a touchdown the whole season.
We may not get the Rose Bowl
bid, but since when has that become
so important? Our avowed purpose
is to whip the Trojans and Bears,
and our team will win. . . .
Bob Leland
Give 'em the axe!— Ed.
