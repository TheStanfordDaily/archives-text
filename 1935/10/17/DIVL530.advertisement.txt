THOUGH large, the Bell System is simple in structure.
Think of it as a tree.
Branches: 24 associated operating companies, each
attuned to the area it serves.
Trunk: The American Telephone and Telegraph
Company, which coordinates all system activities.
Roots: Bell Telephone Laboratories and Western
Electric, whose functions arc scientific research and
manufacture; Long Lines Department of A. T. and T.,
which through its country-wide network of wires links
together the 21 operating companies, handles overseas
service; Advisory Staff of A. T. and T., which advises
the operating companies on all phases of telephone
operation and searches constantly for better methods.
