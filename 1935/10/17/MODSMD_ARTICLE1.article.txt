# Three Indians Can Beat U.S. Swim Record
## Pringle, McKelvey, and Godman Show Up In 50-Meter Race May Win Recognition Vibert, Transfer, Holds Wide Margin 
### Gordy Frost 
Johnny Weissmullers — three of
them—have daily been sweeping
through the waters of Stanford's
Encina pools to unofficially better
the national 50-meter free-style rec
ord.
Larry Pringle, Jack Vibert, and
Henry Godman arc those three.
While an unknowing campus has
been silting by, unconscious of the
fact that it possessed three of the
finest swimmers in the world.
Coach Nort Thornton has been
secretly grooming bis hopes for an
official try at Hawaiian Pau Kco
loha's untouched American record
for the 50-meter free-style swim.
The fact that at least one, and
perhaps all three of Stanford's swim
mers should succeed in shattering
that mark when they make their
official try on Saturday, October 26,
before A.A.U. officials is of little
doubt.
They,are slated to swim for the
record just after the Stanford-
Olympic Club water polo meet
scheduled for the same week-end.
Yesterday afternoon swimmer
Godman, member of the Stanford
varsity in 1934 and not enrolled in
school last year, unofficially an
nihilated the record when he swam
the 50-meter eight-tenths of a sec
ond faster than Keoloha's time of
27.2.
Pringle Fast
Pringle, a frosh, who was rated
second best prep school swimmer in
the United States in his event last
year, also cracked the American
mark, swimming the distance in 27.1,
one-tenth better than the record.
And third among Stanford's "un
knowns" is Vibert, a junior trans
fer from Pasadena J.C., whose time
of 20.7 eclipses the record by a half
second.
Vibert Holds Titles
Vibert, competing for Pasadena
last year, ran away with the South
ern California J.C. meet, winning
the 50, 100, and 200 meters. He was
Pacific Coast Open A.A.U. champion
in the 100 meters.
Stanford has another man who
will possibly join the "big three"
before the season closes. He is
Alec Mackenzie, two years a mem
ber of the varsity squad, and just
this year beginning to hit full
form in competition. Mackenzie
hasn't tried the 50-meter for time
yet. his clocking of 23.8 for the
50-yards indicating, however,
(hat the possibility of his swim
ming under the 27.2 mark for the
50 meters is good.
Thus with four sprint standouts,
Stanford s relay chances soar near
the top this year and as far as break
ing individual sprint records is con
cerned, that should be a matter of
time.
Shatters Two Marks
Pringle himself in practice dur
ing the last week ,has swum the 50-
yard free-style in 22.7, one-tenth
better than Weissmuller's rec
ord of 22.8 and two-tenths slower
than John McKelvey's national time,
22.5. McKclvey, a Stanford swim
mer himself, set the record in 1932.
In the 60-yard Pringle swam in
28.4; the record is 29.6. Last Friday
he bettered every one of Weissmul
ler's famed times.

27.2.
Pringle Fast
Pringle, a frosh, who was rated
second best prep school swimmer in
the United States in his event last
year, also cracked the American
mark, swimming the distance in 27.1,
one-tenth better than the record.
And third among Stanford's "un
knowns" is Vibert, a junior trans
fer from Pasadena J.C., whose time
of 20.7 eclipses the record by a half
second.
Vibert Holds Titles
Vibert, competing for Pasadena
last year, ran away with the South
ern California J.C. meet, winning
the 50, 100, and 200 meters. He was
Pacific Coast Open A.A.U. champion
in the 100 meters.
Stanford has another man who
will possibly join the "big three"
before the season closes. He is
Alec Mackenzie, two years a mem
ber of the varsity squad, and just
this year beginning to hit full
form in competition. Mackenzie
hasn't tried the 50-meter for time
yet. his clocking of 23.8 for the
50-yards indicating, however,
(hat the possibility of his swim
ming under the 27.2 mark for the
50 meters is good.
Thus with four sprint standouts,
Stanford s relay chances soar near
the top this year and as far as break
ing individual sprint records is con
cerned, that should be a matter of
time.
Shatters Two Marks
Pringle himself in practice dur
ing the last week ,has swum the 50-
yard free-style in 22.7, one-tenth
better than Weissmuller's rec
ord of 22.8 and two-tenths slower
than John McKelvey's national time,
22.5. McKclvey, a Stanford swim
mer himself, set the record in 1932.
In the 60-yard Pringle swam in
28.4; the record is 29.6. Last Friday
he bettered every one of Weissmul
ler's famed times.
Johnny Weissmullers — three of
them—have daily been sweeping
through the waters of Stanford's
Encina pools to unofficially better
the national 50-meter free-style rec
ord.
Larry Pringle, Jack Vibert, and
Henry Godman arc those three.
While an unknowing campus has
been silting by, unconscious of the
fact that it possessed three of the
finest swimmers in the world.
Coach Nort Thornton has been
secretly grooming bis hopes for an
official try at Hawaiian Pau Kco
loha's untouched American record
for the 50-meter free-style swim.
The fact that at least one, and
perhaps all three of Stanford's swim
mers should succeed in shattering
that mark when they make their
official try on Saturday, October 26,
before A.A.U. officials is of little
doubt.
They,are slated to swim for the
record just after the Stanford-
Olympic Club water polo meet
scheduled for the same week-end.

Godman, member of the Stanford
