# Bob Hoover Picks Aides For Bonfire
## Wood Supply Sought By Chairman of Annual Big Game Affair 
### 
Appointment of a central commit
tee to direct construction of the Big
Game bonfire was announced last
night by Bob Hoover, co-chairman
of the affair.
Those who have accepted positions
on the committee are Mike Gon
zales, Frank Price, George Ditz,
Harmon Howard, and Webster
Jones. Other committeemen will be
announced later, according to Hoo
ver.
Seeks Wood Supply
Hoover is seeking to get a supply
of railroad ties and telephone poles
for use in the fire. Negotiations for
the wood supply still are tentative,
however, he says. He also will seek
permission to have women students
serve food at the bonfire site the day
the actual building is conducted.
Hoover and Bob Jones, co
chairmen, are planning to have a
bigger fire than in 1934 when a
30-foot Lsoceles triangle was built.
This year's pyre will be in the
shape of a square if the railroad
ties are acquired.
Hoover urges fraternities, halls,
and others having scrap wood to
save it for the fire. He points out
that Row groups putting up new
structures should have large sup
plies of scrap lumber available.
Co-operation Sought
Co-operation of nearby newspa
pers in a campaign for wood in
peninsula cities also will be sought.
Palo Alto lumber and feed and fuel
companies will be asked to loan
trucks for hauling.
During the week preceding the fire
smokers are planned in the men's
dormitories to "pep up" the men and
get up enthusiasm for the affair.
Preceding the fire there will be a
Big Game rally, lasting about an
hour, in the Pavilion. Hoover indi
cates his committee will seek to
make t.he rally one of the biggest
and best of the Big Game series.
"Actual construction will be done
on Thursday, November 21, the day
of the fire," Hoover says.
No Night Guarding
"That will eliminate the necessity
of guarding the pile overnight, and
will prevent any such melees as have
occurred in previous years. Last
year the same plan was followed
and that was the first time someone
was not injured in an attempt by
Californians to light the bonfire."
Jones and Hoover have joined in
urging freshmen to take an active
part in the bonfire preparations.

night by Bob Hoover, co-chairman
of the affair.
Those who have accepted positions
on the committee are Mike Gon
zales, Frank Price, George Ditz,
Harmon Howard, and Webster
Jones. Other committeemen will be
announced later, according to Hoo
ver.
Seeks Wood Supply
Hoover is seeking to get a supply
of railroad ties and telephone poles
for use in the fire. Negotiations for
the wood supply still are tentative,
however, he says. He also will seek
permission to have women students
serve food at the bonfire site the day
the actual building is conducted.
Hoover and Bob Jones, co
chairmen, are planning to have a
bigger fire than in 1934 when a
30-foot Lsoceles triangle was built.
This year's pyre will be in the
shape of a square if the railroad
ties are acquired.
Hoover urges fraternities, halls,
and others having scrap wood to
save it for the fire. He points out
that Row groups putting up new
structures should have large sup
plies of scrap lumber available.
Co-operation Sought
Co-operation of nearby newspa
pers in a campaign for wood in
peninsula cities also will be sought.
Palo Alto lumber and feed and fuel
companies will be asked to loan
trucks for hauling.
During the week preceding the fire
smokers are planned in the men's
dormitories to "pep up" the men and
get up enthusiasm for the affair.
Preceding the fire there will be a
Big Game rally, lasting about an
hour, in the Pavilion. Hoover indi
cates his committee will seek to
make t.he rally one of the biggest
and best of the Big Game series.
"Actual construction will be done
on Thursday, November 21, the day
of the fire," Hoover says.
No Night Guarding
"That will eliminate the necessity
of guarding the pile overnight, and
will prevent any such melees as have
occurred in previous years. Last
year the same plan was followed
and that was the first time someone
was not injured in an attempt by
Californians to light the bonfire."
Jones and Hoover have joined in
urging freshmen to take an active
part in the bonfire preparations.
