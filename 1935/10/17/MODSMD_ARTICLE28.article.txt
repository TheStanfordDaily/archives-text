# Encina Elects Pierose, Keese
## Little Interest Is Shown In Balloting 
### 
In the quietest election seen in
Encina Hall for a number of years,
Dean Pierose last night nosed out his
nearest competitor, Ralph Stotsky,
to be elected president of Encina
Club. Anthony Keese was whs.
unanimously elected manager.
The election, which started Mon
day night with the nomination of
five men for the two offices, was
marked by the lack of interest
shown by inhabitants of the hall.
The final election lasted from 7
till 9 o'clock last night. Less than a
hundred students turned in ballots,
according to Browden Dellinger,
head of the election committee.
All Encina men were eliginle for
election to the two l'espective offices.
The committee stated that the elec
tion was not one limited to frosh but
was for the Encina Club, an organ
ization which included the whole
hall regardless of academic rank of
any individual.
