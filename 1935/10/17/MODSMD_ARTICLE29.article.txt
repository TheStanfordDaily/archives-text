TULSA, Okla., Oct. 16 (/P). —Being
the wife of public enemy No. 1 is a
hard life even if you haven't seen
the errant husband for four yeai's,
Mrs. Alvin Karpis said today.
The latest set-back for the comely
woman who recently sued Karpis for
divorce, was ejection from a busi
ness college here, where she was
studying to be a stenographer.
"I had a job promised just as soon
as I learned to be a stenographer—
and now what," she said hopelessly.
"I don't know what I'll do. I guess
I'll try to go to another school where
they don't know me."
