# Row Men Purchase 2000 Rushing Cards
## 
### 
The first day of sale for rushing
cards saw a much greater demand
for them than last year, according
to Johnny Edmundson, secretary of
the Interfraternity Council. Each
house was allowed 85 cards out of
the first 2000 printed. All the cards
had been taken by 4 o'clock. An
additional 800 were placed on sale
later, of which there are some left.
Cards not sold yesterday may be
bought today by house representa
tives.
The first rushing period will be
held for three days starting Tues
day. Ed Littlefield, president of the
Intcrfraternily Council, warns all
freshmen that any violation of rush
ing rules will result in deferred
pledging.
