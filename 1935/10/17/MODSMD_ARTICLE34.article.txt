### 
LONDON, Oct. 16 (/P). â€” Hope
faded tonight for a peaceful settle
ment of the Italo-Ethiopian war
through the mediation of Premier
aval of France.
Replies of British and Italian am
bassadors to the Laval proposals
were said by authoritative sources
in Paris to indicate a stalemate even
as news from the African war zone
indicated a turn about in the game
of military invasion.
Mussolini Silent on Terms
The Paris reports said Mussolini
had refused to state his terms for
peace; that Great Britain had re
fused to lessen her Mediterranean
naval concentration and that II Duce
had declined to negotiate while the
British warships remained.
With European eyes again focused
on America, tardy dispatches frorr
East Africa said strong bands ol
Ethiopian raiders had captured two
towns in a swift penetration of
Italian Somaliland.
The League of Nations, wrest
ling with sanctions and how to
make theni stick, hailed the Amer
ican Federation of Labor indict
ment of Italy as an "outlaw na
tion" in the light of a vital aid to
economic pressure on Italy.
In Paris, officials disclosed both
France and Great Britain intend to
ask the United States whether it
would support a world-wide em
bargo against Italian exports, should
Geneva approve such a boycott.
Tension in the troubled Medi
terranean went unabated.
