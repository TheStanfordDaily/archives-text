# Freddy, Bob Vex Staff Of Campus P.O.

### R. B. Jones 
"Hoping you have enough to get
I here," says Bob somebody speaking
financially, or "an ensuing piller
fight came next" as "love and kiss
es" Freddy so pugnaciously put it.
These excerpts from unaddressed
post cards are only a few that every
: year remain at the Stanford post
office. Aphrodite or some other God
I of stupor places the sender iri a
I temporary state of coma, and the
latter forgets to address his epistle.
The members of the department
I not being mind-readers tack these
cards up in a conspicuous place
where they should be retrieved
i through Richard Owen, superin
| tendent, otherwise "My own little
' Joan" is to be defiled under public
I gaze.
In a more sober aspect, Mr. Owen
requests that Freddy or whoever he
1 may be tie a little string around his
| or her finger and remember to ad
i dress the postcard, as once in a while
| the missive, although without des
i tiny, pertains to some matter of
1 importance.
