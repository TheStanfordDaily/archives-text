# Grayson. Topping Debate At Prison
## Gros To Join Football Stars Against Felons Cards Meet Experienced Convicts Sunday 
### 
Bobby Grayson and Keith Top
ping will be seen in action at San
Quentin â€”in a debate. With Bob
Gros, the two prominent gridiron
flashes will form a trio which will
meet experienced convict speakers
of the state penitentiary this Sun
day afternoon in the Stanford-San
Quentin annual classic.
For Gros, present student man
ager, debating is a major "sport,"
haying served as debate manager in
the past year, and provided Stanford
with the most extensive forensic
program in the university's history.
First Debate
For Grayson and Topping, how
ever, this San Quentin clash will be
the first college debate. Unknown
to the general campus, the all-
American and his team-mate are
old-timers on the platform. The
former won several oratorical con
tests in high school, and has been
an active speaker before high
school audiences since coming to
Stanford, while the latter is a pub
lic speaking major, and claimed nu
merous declamation prizes at
Pasadena.
Debate Coach Lee C'hapin, who
has been grooming the trio, says,
"Grayson and Topping both show
unusual ability as speakers. Their
talent has not been revealed owing
to their interest in athletics."
Chapin points out that the San
Quentin team is not made up of the
ordinary run of convicts, but in
cludes many brilliant scholars. In
the past, the prison has had an
Oxford student and many other
famous university graduates.
Former Alabama Man
The present team captain is a
man who attended the University of
Alabama and was on the Lyceum
Circuit before he "joined" the peni
tentiary squad.
This will be a decision debate on
the question, "Resolved, that Con
gress should be permitted by a two
thirds majority vote tp over-ride
any 5-4 decision of the Supreme
Court declaring a law unconstitu
tional." Stanford will uphold the
affirmative.
