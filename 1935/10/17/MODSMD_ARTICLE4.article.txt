# Labor Warned Of Red Growth
## New Organization System Urged by Howard 
### 
ATLANTIC CITY, N.J., Oct. 1G
(/P). —Warnings that workers in the
vast mass production industries
might turn to communism or fascism
for organization unless they were
brought under the banners of the
,American Federation of Labor were
handed the federation convention
today by John L. Lewis and Charles
P. Howard.
These warnings came a short time
after the federation declared Italy
an "outlaw nation" and urged all
countries to deny her financial and
commercial assistance in the Ethi
opian war.
Ruin Feared
In the tense atmosphere that sur
rounded the start of the federation's
biggest family fight on the conven
tion floor, Lewis, president of the
United Mine Workers, told the dele
gates that continuation of the fed
eration's present organization policy
"will spell ruination of the labor
movement."
"There are forces at work in this
country," he said, "that would wipe
out the labor movement here just
as they did in Germany and Italy.
"I think that on the decision of
this convention rests the future of
the American Federation of Labor."
Howard, president of the Typo
graphical Union, told the conven
tion that the change would origi
nate with the workers themselves.
Workers Organize
"Let me say to you, the workers of
this country are going to organize,"
he said. "If they're not going to be
permitted to organize under the
banners of the American Federation
of Labor, they're going to organize
under some other leadership —or
under no leadership."
Like Lewis, Howard said that
"subversive" forces were at work
among American working men.
The issue was whether the con
vention should reaffirm its San
Francisco declaration that mass pro
duction industry employes should
be organized along industrial lines,
with due protection of the rights of
craft unions, or whether the federa
tion should organize these workers
into industrial unions irrespective of
their craft.
