RAPID CITY, S.D., Oct. 16 (/P).— !
When Captains Albert W. Stevens
and Orvil A. Anderson land after
their projected stratosphere flight,
now awaiting favorable weather,
| they will bear some resemblance to ;
football players as they climb from j
the gondola.
The fliers have borrowed football '
| helmets from the Rapid City High
j School and bought knee and elbow
: pads to don before landing. The '
! gondola is expected to roll on im
pact with the earth and the fliers
I planned these precautions because J
of the many instruments with sharp
i corners and edges inside the ball.
