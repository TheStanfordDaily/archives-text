CAMERA CATCHES
INDIAN "DUTCHES"
A strip of celluloid may be re
sponsible for some changes in the
Stanford football team this week.
When Tiny Thornhill watched
his team replay last Saturday's
game on the screen Tuesday night
as the oilicial B.A.C. pictures
were shown, he found out two or
three things that didn't exactly
suit him.
He discovered the major reason
that Stanford reserves weren't good
lor consistent gains, and he's already
laid plans to remedy the faulty
situation. This is the way he tells it:
"On the reverses both Paulman
and Reynolds are supposed to take
out ihe end but nearly every time
he'd get away. They weren't miss
ing but just didn't stop him long
enough. Now that shoudn't happen.
"Both those men are big enough
so that they can clear the end out
of the play alone. I think that
might have been the trouble—
each was relying too much on the
other.
"So now I'm planning to take one
of them off that job, and then if the
ciid gets in we'll know just who to
speak to."
Tiny noticed another point that
didn't exactly please him. He
thought Wes Muller was playing the
ball too much for a center. In one
shot of a Stanford pass, Wes could
be seen tearing out, almost ahead of
the intended pass catcher, even
though he was ineligible to receive
the throw had it come his way.
Thornhill was not peeved be
cause his center was "hall hawk
ing" on some of the plays but he
thought Wes should have plugged
the line on that, and other passes.
A condition that was commonly
noticed during the game itself came
even more to the fore in the slow
motion replay. That was th 3 lack
of blockers to protect the Stanford
safety man, following a punt.
In one play, eight Uclans w.ere
down before the first Stanford man
and Tiny didn't like that a bit. He
hadn't decided what the remedy
would be yesterday but he was cer
tain that before Stanford meets
Washington a week from Saturday
"something will be done."
