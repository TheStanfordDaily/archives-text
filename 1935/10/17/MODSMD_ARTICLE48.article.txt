# Chet Olcott Lost To Grid Team
## Knee Injury Puts End On Cripple List Schott, Trompas Move Up To Wing Positions On Indian Varsity 
### Warren Breed 
First it was Frank Alustiza. Then J
it was Bones Hamilton.
Then Moscrip and Topping—all j
four injured in the U.C.L.A. affair.
Last night, toward the end of j
practice, Dr. Fritz Roth, team phy
sician, announced that Chet Olcott,
second-string end, was out for the
rest of the season.
Has Wrenched Knee
The chunky wingman, in his first
year of competition, has a wrenched j
knee, one that could stand no more j
pounding or twisting this year.
Now that would not be so tragic
if it were not for the fact that
both regular ends, Moscrip and
Topping, are out, and another
capable reserve and pass catcher, j
Roger Munger, is out as well.
That leaves Carl Schott and Alex '
Trompas as varsity ends, with Grant
Stone, Cy Oberg, and Walt Chouteau ;
the only other reserve material on |
hand.

Bob Dakan, beefy soph who was |
first-string frosh end last year, but !
who has been playing tackle all fall, i
By Washington game time, how- j
ever, when the team leaves for
Seattle, Moscrip and Topping, j
barring further trouble, will be
okeh, for their present incapacity
is just a matter of half a dozen
bruises and odd lacerations. They
are just laying out this week, bid
ing their time for the Huskies,
Broncs, and Trojans.
Meanwhile, Schott, last year's Big
Game place-kick hero, is working |
with Trompas, and showing some of !
the neatest pass catching since tall
Don Colvin was around, tucking
them all away, near and far.
Bones Hamilton still favors the |
leg, but is counted on for the Wash
ington game.
But just because Old Man Pilikia,
John P. Double-Trouble himself,
has dealt the Cards a sad and mean
Hand in these last five days, it is no
sign that the Big Red Machine" is not
as big or as red as it ever war.
Out in practice workouts all week
the athletes have shown no sign of
discouragement, but have run
through their signals with a new
mixture of vinegar and ginger, and
with Bobby Grayson looking prac
tically unstoppable, and the line giv
ing sawdust dummies a terrific beat

it is once more the tops.

has dealt the Cards a sad and mean
Hand in these last five days, it is no
sign that the Big Red Machine" is not
as big or as red as it ever war.
Out in practice workouts all week
the athletes have shown no sign of
discouragement, but have run
through their signals with a new
mixture of vinegar and ginger, and
with Bobby Grayson looking prac
tically unstoppable, and the line giv
ing sawdust dummies a terrific beat
ing, the old machine looks as though
it is once more the tops.
First it was Frank Alustiza. Then J
it was Bones Hamilton.
Then Moscrip and Topping—all j
four injured in the U.C.L.A. affair.
Last night, toward the end of j
practice, Dr. Fritz Roth, team phy
sician, announced that Chet Olcott,
second-string end, was out for the
rest of the season.
Has Wrenched Knee
The chunky wingman, in his first
year of competition, has a wrenched j
knee, one that could stand no more j
pounding or twisting this year.
Now that would not be so tragic
if it were not for the fact that
both regular ends, Moscrip and
Topping, are out, and another
capable reserve and pass catcher, j
Roger Munger, is out as well.
That leaves Carl Schott and Alex '
Trompas as varsity ends, with Grant
Stone, Cy Oberg, and Walt Chouteau ;
the only other reserve material on |
hand.
May Advancc Dakan
Coach Tiny Thornhill figures to j
move up for possible replacement !
Bob Dakan, beefy soph who was |
first-string frosh end last year, but !
who has been playing tackle all fall, i
By Washington game time, how- j
ever, when the team leaves for
Seattle, Moscrip and Topping, j
barring further trouble, will be
okeh, for their present incapacity
is just a matter of half a dozen
bruises and odd lacerations. They
are just laying out this week, bid
ing their time for the Huskies,
Broncs, and Trojans.
Meanwhile, Schott, last year's Big
Game place-kick hero, is working |
with Trompas, and showing some of !
the neatest pass catching since tall
Don Colvin was around, tucking
them all away, near and far.
Bones Hamilton still favors the |
leg, but is counted on for the Wash
ington game.
But just because Old Man Pilikia,
John P. Double-Trouble himself,
has dealt the Cards a sad and mean
Hand in these last five days, it is no
sign that the Big Red Machine" is not
as big or as red as it ever war.
