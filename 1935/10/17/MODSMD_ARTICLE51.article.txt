# Papooses Prepare For Trojan Gridiron Battle
## 
### Bob Leland 
"No chances taken" might be a
good way of describing the prepa
rations being made by Coach Jimmy
Bradshaw and his frosh gridders for
the all-important contest with the
Trobabes in Los Angeles.
For two weeks, Bradshaw has been
pointing to this S.C. game. He has
worked out a defense to smother
the varied thrusts that generate
from Troy formations. The big fast
charging Papoose line has been
drilled and drilled. Walt Hege, Dave
Carnahan, Pete Zagar, and Dick
Sutton continually poured in on the
reserves as they vainly tried to gain
a yard with the flashy Trobabe of
fense.
The backfield will be well manned
defensively with Bill Kirsch, a sweet
back, Wally deWitt, a big fellow who
backs up the line in convincing
fashion. Ed Gamier and Hank
Glasser are not flashy but depend
able.
This Trobabe outfit has some fine
performers including such as Mc-
Neil, center, tough on defense; Haas,
Frye, and George, - tackles; Ilicker
son and Jones, alternating fullbacks,
the former a power house, the latter
lighter and elusive; Russell and
Dunn, blocking halfbacks, who are
reputedly sweet blockers; and Mat
hews, highly touted ball carrier at
quarterback.
