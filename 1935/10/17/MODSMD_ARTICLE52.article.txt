# Cubs May Top Frosh Poloists
## 
### 
When the yearling water ooloists
tangle with the California freshmen
at Berkeley Saturday morning, it
will be the first time in 23 years that
| the Bear Cubs are favored to hand
j the Indians a defeat.
The undefeated Californians have
piled up relatively large scores
i against all of their opponents and
| show promise of coming through the
season as the greatest frosh squad
(hat ever represented the Berkeley
; institution.
Strong Offense
In Prizer and Wheeler, ace for
wards, the Bears have the power
that has made their offense what it
is. Of interest is the fact that these
men and Johnny Lamb, who now
stars for the Cardinal freshmen,
comprised the forward line on the
Southern California all-star prep
j squad. Bill Clapp, fleshy guard and
i brother of Austin Clapp, former
Stanford ace, captains the Cubs.
Farm Has Good Record
The Papooses boast a powerful
| offense centered about Lamb, but the
Stanford guards must stop Wheeler
and Prizer before they can even hope
to win. The Farm men have played
two more games than the Bears. One
I defeat mars their record.
