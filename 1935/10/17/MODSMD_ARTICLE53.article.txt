In another game requiring ten ex
tra plays, the Fiji's defeated Chi Psi
ll's mural football team yesterday
by the play-off score of 1 to 0. When
each team had carried the ball for
five downs after the end of the regu
lar period, the pigskin rested in Chi
Psi territory; so the Fiji's were given
the decision.
In spite of Lunt's field goal, the
A.K.L.'s conquered the Theta Xi's
yesterday by the unusual mural
score of 13 to 0. Passes from Wallace
to Mason and Broughton resulted in
the victors' touchdowns.
