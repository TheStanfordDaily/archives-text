# Bulldogs Down Indians 2-0 In Soccer Contest
## Card Teamwork Weak In Conference Opener 
### 
Although her warriors outplayed
the visitors from the beginning, j
Stanford dropped a 2-0 soccer game
to San M;iteo J.C. yesterday after- \
noon in the first conference game ol I
the season. In individual perform- |
ances the Cards were outstanding,
but they lacked the team work
shown by the junior college squad.
Starling out strong in the first pe
riod, Stanford threatened several
times while holding San Mateo j
scoreless. However, in the second j
quarter the Bulldogs rallied and
| pushed over one goal, led by the
brilliant playing of Sloper and Malt- j
zeff. In the third they again scored j
and although the Stanford team j
threatened to tally, the J.C. defense
! was too tight.
Cards' First Game
San Mateo had the advantage of
several previous games, while this !
was Stanford's first and what the j
junior college outfit lacked in in- j
. dividual performance it made up for |
with splendid team work.
The Cards' defense, with the ex
; ception of one or two "butches,"
! was spotless but the home club was
I ragged on offensive team work. The
; forward wall seemed to have trouble
i getting into scoring position and
i missed numerous opportunities to
' score. However, Coach Dick Builis
is looking' for much improvement in
j the next week.
Vierling Outstanding
j Outstanding among the players on
the field was Captain Barney Vier
; ling of the Stanford team. His stellar
| work on defense kept the ball out
| of the enemy territory for a good
part of the game and aided mate
rially in holding the score down.
Hatch and Hall played good ball on
offense, leading several attacks on
the Bulldog goal that failed only be-
I cause of the airtight defense.
