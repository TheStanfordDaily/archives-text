# "Let the Winds of Freedom Blow"
## Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily Member of the Associated Press Job of Teaching Stanford Hymn Falls Upon Rally Committee, Not the Daily 
### 
"There you are, lake your choice," said the
Ex Committee to the Daily on Tuesday after
several plans for the improving of hymn-sing
ing had been suggested.
Hut the choice is not the Daily's. There is
a duly organized body in the A.S.S.U. within
whose sphere such matters come; namely,
the Rally Committee.
Nine days from now the team goes on the
licld again, needing student support more
than ever. Furthermore, if Stanford is to
keep her self-respect, rooting must improve
in this season of uphill light.
Granting that it is an appropriate time for
teaching or practicing yells and songs, the
important but sadly neglected hymn is the
logical spot for concentration. In the next
nine days it is incumbent upon the Rally
Committee to act decisively in the way of
teaching the hymn.
The "catch-'em-young" plan has been sug
gested. Encina smokers and Roble dinners
oiler an ideal way to teach the hymn to Stan
ford's neophytes. II such a plan were adopted,

there would be no hymn problem. Hut today
there is a problem. What to do about it?
Not what Cal and U.C.L.A. do —sing in class
rooms. That would have little appeal to the
pseudo-sophisticated Farm student, no doubt
even less to the Administration—and besides
it smacks of copying.
Every living group could be visited by Rally
Committeemen — members coining either
from the groups themselves or outside. Fra
ternities might welcome a lew Stanford songs
after dinner to add to lighter-veined ones.
Eating clubs might put excess enthusiasm
into singing instead of throwing water. And
Hall men are always open to another smoker.
Ex Committee has passed the matter with
suggestions. The Daily, however, does not
feel hymn-teaching is within its province.
; Football season is hourly getting no younger.
Vet the poor quality of hymn-singing calls for
action, as does the loss of a game and a man
by Stanford's team. Hut the song problem is
up to the Rally Committee, with the backing
of the Daily.
