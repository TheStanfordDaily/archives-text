# In Line with Keeping Death Off the Bayshore

Pleading to newspapers to lead a "relentless
campaign against auto accidents" in Chicago
Tuesday, Lynwood 1. Noycs, president of the
Inland Daily Press Association, made one of
the most constructive attempts in recent years
to elevate the tone and purpose of the Ameri
can press.
Mr. Noycs described the "frightful toll" of
mortality and injuries as "worse than war,"
in their annual toll of life and property, and
added he had noted that "an awakening in
the press" already had prompted action on
the part of state legislatures and highway olli
eials.
The plea was significant for two reasons:
First, it voiced the awakening of newspapers
to their public responsibility; second, it crys
tal i zed the increasing fear of auto accidents
the thinking American is beginning to feel.
Seven "deadly sins of traffic" as listed by
the National Safety Council are inattention,
excessive speed, traffic violations, intoxica
tion, the road hog, unfitness for driving, and
ilailure to keep cars in a safe condition.
Every thinking college student will con
cede the danger of each of these. Conscious
ness of them on the part of the Stanford
Hough has become more apparent this year
than ever before. Dr. Wilbur's well-known
"gasol i ne-aiu I -alcohol -do-not-mix" slogan has
worked its way permanently into the Farm
student's mind and has become one of the
feast-violated of Stanford traditions.
Inasmuch as this fear of accidents has be
come lirinlv imbedded in the thinking citi
zen's sensibility, all that remains is to carry
it to the country's masses. This is where
Mr. Noves' campaign for newspaper co-opera
lion steps in facts and figures have fright
ened intelligent thinkers; only the nation's
press, by constant hammering, can bring this
scare down to the non-thinking dare-devils
who now menace the highways.
