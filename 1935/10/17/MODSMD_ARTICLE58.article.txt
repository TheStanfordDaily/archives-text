# Another One of Those Things

Willi cold selling in, and temperatures
dropping in the evenings, a better lhan aver
age crop ol high school letterinen's sweaters
are making their appearance on the Farm.
While nol a major tradition, the taboo on
sncli display is one ol those that are an inte
gral part ol' the living Stanford. When stu
dents enroll on the Farm, they become Stan
lord men, and cease to be big-shots of this,
that, or the other prep school. Hence they
do not wear rings, pins, letters, or any high
school insignia save C.S.F. pins, if they feel
so inclined.
Several offenders when approached have
pleaded that their letterinen's sweaters are
the only warm clothing that tlicv have. This

may be so, and in this case it would he fool
hardy to try to dissuade them. Hut they can
I use them as little as possible, take the blocks
j oil', and get a new sweater when financially
able.
