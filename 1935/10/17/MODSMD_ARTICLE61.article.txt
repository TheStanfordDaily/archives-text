ISIS SEES A NEW DAY
"I am that which has been . . . that which is . . .
and that which will be . . . and no mortal shall ever
lift the veil which covers me."
* * * *
That quotation, translated from the French, is a
little paradox of the Art Gallery, the building which
runs a close second to the Museum for the title of
Stanford's most deserted hall.
* * * *
Massive, drab green, and stiffly erect, the statue of
haughty Isi.s has been reigning in solitude over the Art
Gallery with all the majesty of the great Egyptian
goddess which mythology gives her credit for being
ever since 1922 when the figure was presented by the
people of Belgium in honor of services rendered by
Herbert Hoover. And at her feet, as if dictating the
destiny of the building that was her kingdom, was
inscribed the quotation concerning what has been,
what is, and what will be.
* * * *
But now has come the revolution. Isis has even
been shoved out of her throne room to a place near
the front door. That which has been was a pitiful
example of the art gallery Stanford deserves. On its
walls hung great dusty paintings—a few good, more
mediocre. In the exhibit room were displayed at vary
ing intervals the works of local water color and crayon
artists. The whole place was gloomy, forbidding, and
stocked with a collection of such stuff that if a dozen
persons entered the doors in a day, Queen Isis must
have rejoiced for weeks.

That which is is a state of reform. The former
throne room is being converted into a lecture hall and
remodeled exhibit room. There, when the smell of
fresh paint has floated away, will be held evening
showings of art work in the form of motion pictures,
slides, and the works of art themselves. The attrac
tions which will be offered may even be of such a
caliber that the Art Gallery will be stricken from the
list of forgotten halls.
The administrators of the Art Gallery, whoever
they are, have at last realized that their building is not
destined to be the resting place for great works of art,
and so are determined to do the best they can, and
bring pictures of them. And this is worthy in spite of
the violation to the creed of Goddess Isis.
