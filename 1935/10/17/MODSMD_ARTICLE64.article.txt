The Editor, Sir:
While it may be unwise to boy-
I cott the Olympic games for diplo
f matic reasons, we cannot escape the
fact that the high ideals of these
games are being prostituted to the
monstrous schemes of the Nazis.
The money acquired from the
! games will be used to strengthen
Hitler's shaky regime and to fur
; ther stifle "the winds of freedom"
in Germany.
Despite the Nazi government's as
j surance of nondiscrimination, perse
j cution has increased—that of ath
-1 letes being carried on under cover.
The fact that persecution will
: cease only during the games leaves
| a nauseous odor about the situa
! tion.
j The Olympic Games are the high
est ambition of all amateur athletes;
| a wonderful experience for our rep
resentatives. But they will still be
: merely pawns.
