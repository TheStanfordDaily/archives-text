The Editor, Sir:
t According to our friend Mr. Le
i land (here is a fog of gloom hanging
over the campus. Personally I think
the air looks pretty clear. Probably
the trouble was that we were begin
ning to think that the big Red Ma
chine was absolutely infallible, and
of coursc when we begin to feel that
way we are bound to ride for a fall.
Despite the defeat, which really
wasn't so bad—as long as it wasn't
Cal or U.S.C.—wasn't a death blow
or anything near it; and despite the
loss of Alustiza, the campus doesn't
so gloomy. In fact, some of us,
I am sure, are glad it happened—
because if we come out on top now
it will truly be a great victory.
Sincerely yours,
N.P.M.
