"BIG BROADCAST OF 1936"
j At the Fox-Stanford
A From the ranks of come
dians, crooners, dancers,
and actors, Paramount has
selected what it believes to
i be the tops in entertainment, and
using television as the background
, for a story, has created a smooth
running, sparkling movie.
The list seems to be unending as
the stars are reviewed through Jack
j Oakie's television set, borrowed
| from George Burns. Something of a
plot is evidenced when Oakie, a ra
dio Lochinvar, meets Lyda Roberti,
a rich but slightly potty countess,
i and follows her to her island home
in the hopes of obtaining funds with
which to finance his radio audition
j in a big contest.
Into the story is carefully woven
the timely appearances of Fithel
Merman, Bing Crosby, Ray Noble,
Amos and Andy, the Nicholas broth
j ers, Ina Ray Hutton and orchestra,
Willie West and McGinty, Benny
Baker, and Bill Robinson. All in all,
1 a clever and amusing film is the
result. —Hawley
A species of cane grown in France
is the soui'ce of saxophone reeds.
