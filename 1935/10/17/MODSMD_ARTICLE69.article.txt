# DIANA'S DIARY

### THE CO-ED SHOPPER 
October 17
Dear Diary: Misfortunes come at once, they say. First that U.C.L.A.
game, then a lock-out. and now a prospective flunk in English lit. I was
in a dither over the last until I found my trouble was punctuation, which
can be cured by having the ASSOCIATED STENOGRAPHERS type my
papers. They go in for correcting mistakes. I just came from their new
office at 433 Bryant 'cross from the police station. The lock-out isn't so
bad because I had such a swell time getting it. Ted and I went dancing in
the city after the football disaster. I wore my new informal from MARY
ELIZABETH'S, 119 University. It's a soft green crepe with a plain skirt
and a super-becoming blouse of green combined with silver metal. My
evening hat was a tiny draped turban of the silver. The finishing touch
was a cape jasmine corsage from the FLOWER SHOP, 175 University—
those grand new flowers that look like gardenias, but don't bruise at
your touch. I'm positively raving over the'new line of slips just received
at MARIAN SEIMAS". 534 Ramona. They're in satin or crepe and only
$1.95 to $2.95. What I like best about 'em is the way they fit. After roomie
and I fixed up our room with DIXIT'S Oriental things, we couldn't keep
away from his shop at 165 University. Their imported lounging pajamas
in satins and brocades come at prices as low as $4.95. and how could we
resist their robes? Well, I've found my sole mate—right down at the
WALK-OVER, 220 University. It's a pair of snug wool-lined slippers
that come up over the ankle and fasten down the front with a zipper.
Clever, and oh. so warm! Now I really will be hair-conditioned. I mean
LYDIA'S Stanford Special that takes complete care of shampoos, waves,
and hair-cuts for only $3 a month. I told the gals they'd better phone
22692 for appointments. Lipsticks do make a lot of difference in a girl's
appearance. 1 like em to stay put, but not turn purple or orange. That's
why I've fallen for the Alexandra de Markoff new automatic lipstick at
the UNIVERSITY PHARMACY, 134 University. You can get refills, too.
Ted and I are going down to Paly I think I hear him bellowing in the
hall now for me. We both want to pick out our Christmas cards at WIGHT
MAN S, 366 University. They have a grand selection and it's none too
soon to be ordering them. (Adv.)
