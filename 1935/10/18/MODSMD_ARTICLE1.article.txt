# Indian Frosh, Trojan Babes Meet In L.A.
## Spirit Is Evident as 26 Prepare To Entrain For L.A. Tonight Bradshaw's Team Big Team in Shape Despite Minor Hurts 
### Bob Leland 
If determination and fight can win
a football game, then the Stanford
frosh will win from the Southern
California Trobabes tomorrow at
Los Angeles. That opinion predomi
nates among the 26 players as they
prepare to leave tonight for the
south.
Coach Jimmy Bradshaw has a
big tough team, one that no one
will push around for long at a
time. They have proved efficient
at pass defense in their two games;
and while not claiming such great
"nil-this" and "all-that" players,
they still can take care of them
selves on the gridiron.
Injuries have played small havoc
with the squad this week; but in
spite of these minor hurts, the Pap
ooses should take the field at game
time with a strong lineup.
