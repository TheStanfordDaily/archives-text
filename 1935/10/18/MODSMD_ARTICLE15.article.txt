# Bob Grayson Injures Leg In Practice
## Sprain Incurred Again; Hamilton Still Out 
### Gordy Frost 
Bobby Grayson, his bad ankle re- |
sprained, went back to the hospital
last night. And Tiny Thornhill sat;
on a bench in the training room j
wondering just what would happen
next.
Dr. William Northway, assistant |
team physician, wasn't certain last i
night just how long Bobby will be j
occupying his old hospital bed but
every indication led to the proba- (
bility that his new sprain—exactly j
the same as the old—would lay him !
up for just about the same time — !
two or three days.
Out All Next Week
Thus the main cog in the Big Red
Machine again goes on the injured j
list and, even if everything works
out for the best, won't be able to do 1
any real practicing before Stanford |
leaves for Washington next Thurs- ;
day.
The sprain occurred when Gray
son was can-ying the ball in a line
scrimmage session yesterday after
noon. Just after he'd cut through
left tackle, two of the secondaries !
came in to stop him and in the re
sulting pile-up, someone acciden- J
tally either rolled on or kicked the j
bad ankle.
Thornhill thought, and hoped, j
that it was just a pinched nerve:
causing the trouble, but every ap- j
pearance led to the belief that it was ■
the same old sprain.
Team to Scout U.C.
Tiny will take his team, a 50-man
scouting party, across the bay to- |
morrow to see the California-Santa \
Clara fracas.
Before Grayson's accident put a
complete damper on practice last I
night, Thornhill's men were showing !
more fire than has been seen all '
week.
"Monk" Back Monday-
Bones Hamilton was still out of
uniform, his pulled muscle still not I
greatly improved, and the proba
bility loomed that he might not be
in condition to go on the field against
Washington next week.
Monk Moscrip was also out of
practice, his bashed leg still drain- j
ing. Both he and Keith Topping are i
slated to be back in uniform Mon- |
day.

"Monk" Back Monday-
Bones Hamilton was still out of
uniform, his pulled muscle still not I

slated to be back in uniform Mon- |
