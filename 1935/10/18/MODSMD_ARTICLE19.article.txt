### 
ADDIS ABABA, Oct. 17 (/P).â€”An
official Ethiopian communique said
the government had been informed
there are "grave differences of opin
ion" between Premier Mussolini and
General Emilio de Bono, in com
mand of the Northern Italian army,
and that De Bono had offered to
resign.
"Mussolini is most displeased with
the stagnation of military operations
around Aduwa, seriously affecting
prestige of the Eritrean army," said
the communique.
"The King of Italy is reported to
have intervened in order to termi
nate the dispute.
"Mussolini," it was asserted, "re
monstrated violently with General
de Bono, even threatening to remove
him, whereupon the general is re
ported to have resigned.
"He is reported to have said that
the topographical difficulties in
Ethiopia, the enormous number of
sick, food and water supply diffi
culties, and determined resistance
of the Ethiopians had lowered the
morale of the Italians and he would
not assume responsibility of launch
ing an adventure leading to disaster "
