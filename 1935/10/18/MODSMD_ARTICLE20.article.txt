## 
### 
ROME, Oct. 17 {A'). â€”Enemy forces
I were reported officially tonight to be
' massing around Makale, where mili
tary experts have predicted a "big
battle" would be fought.
Italian air squads, which failed to
locate many Ethiopians in that
region during the past week, re
ported today they had encountered
: intense fire from large groups of
, tribesmen.
(Makale lies about 80 miles south
j east of Aduwa, now in Italy's hands.
I It is reported to be the next Fascist
J objective in a drive into the inte
j rior.)
j Fighting on the southern front is
' getting scant mention in official an
| nouncements. But signs are plain
|at home war is going on. Soldiers
I are crowding Naples and other ports,
j Six large ships with 11,000 men and
| huge supplies will leave Naples dur-
I ing the next 48 hours.
