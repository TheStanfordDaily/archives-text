# "Forgotten" Women Found At The Oaks
## 
### GAIL LAWRENCE 
Stanford's "forgotten" women dc- I
mand recognition! The Oaks, new
women's living group, having re
| fumed Lagunita's shower curtains,
! systematized their phone calls, and
learned the way home, is now
ready to take an active part in cam
pus life as the newest of women's
dormitories.
Faced with an unprecedented de
mand for knowledge this fall, the
i administration leased the site of the
! Harker School and installed therein
some forty transfer women, hailing
from New York to Hawaii.
On arriving these women found
i their way. with some difficulty, tc
the corner of North Melville and
Harker Avenues where refinishing
was in full swing. Presently there
was order and they found them
i selves capable not only of getting
home by themselves, but of direct

ing others to the Oaks. More furni
ture, house rules, lock-outs, and
lock-ins were introduced, and the
women finished comparing "last
year's school" and settled down to
life on, though off, the Farm.
Life at the Oaks offers varied at
tractions not to be found elsewhere.
For instance, a private swimming
pool, three tennis courts, and mail
delivered to the dormitory. A spe
cial bus carries them to the campus
for eight o'clocks, and back at noon
for lunch.
Besides there is a stove which
occasionally makes it necessary for
meals to be cooked and sent down
from Lagunita, and the "Knothole"
where candy, cigarettes, and other
supplies may be purchased
With their domestic affairs in or
der, the women of The Oaks and its
annex. The Acorn, hereby make
their bid for enmpus recognition.
