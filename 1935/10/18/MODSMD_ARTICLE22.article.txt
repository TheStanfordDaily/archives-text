# Speaker Urges Cooperation of People of West
## Siegfried Tells Need For Exchange of Culture 
### 
"The* future supremacy of Europe
depends on the co-operation of the
United States in helping her to
maintain her individualism, socially
and economically," declared Andre
Siegfried, French economist and
traveler, at yesterday's University
assembly.
After outlining the status in the
nineteenth century, "a century of
internationalism," the famed lec
turer and author of the recent best
seller, "America Comes of Age,"
turned to a survey of the twentieth
century.
Circulation Reduced
"Circulation* not only of goods
and ideas, but of men, has declined
in recent years," stated Siegfried.
"If I were in Russia, Germany, or
Italy now, do you think I would be
allowed to say the things I am say
ing here today?"
Pointing to Asia as a menace to
the supremacy of the European con
tinent, Siegfried related how the
low standard of living and low
wages operated to defeat European
ambitions, while on the other hand,
the United States, with her high
wage scale, mass production, and
standardization of products, was also
blocking her supremacy.
U.S. Has Advantage
"The system in America is sim
pler," contended Siegfried, "because
you're a younger nation. Europe
cannot standardize as you can."
"Conversely, when mass produc
tion will not work in the United
States, and the 'high wage becomes
too high,' when the manufacture of
difficult machinery and inventions
are to be considered, Europe gains
the upper hand over both Asia and
America," declared the noted econo
mist.
Siegfried concluded his address
with a plea for more cultural indi
vidualism, more creative genius,
and a lower standard of living for
Europe.
"White Hopes" Named
"The future of Europe is in Eu
rope. We must remain faithful to
liberty and to culture."
Herein the lecturer saw a possible
alliance of France and the United
States as (he two great "white
hopes" of the realization of freer
interchanging of ideas, and made
mention of a "sanctity of contract"
to bind the two together.
