alumni secretary, it was Erst shown
at the gathering of distinguished

October 10, and has received favor
able comment from Ihose who
viewed it. Its only other appearance
to date was at Philadelphia last Sat
urday.
While the film is primarily in

probably be used in co-operation
with Wally Brooke's plan for Stan
ford assemblies at various high
schools. Additions will be made as
pictures of additional school func

during the year. If necessary an
other film will be made for high
