# Highway Hell Vividly Pictured
## And Sudden Death

Publicizing the total of motoring injuries—almost a million last year,
with 36,000 deaths—never gets to first base in jarring the motorist into
a realization of the appalling risks of motoring. He does not translate dry
statistics into a reality of blood and agony.
Figures exclude the pain and horror of savage mutilation—which means
they leave out the point. ... A passing look at a bad smash . . , will make
any driver but a born fool slow down at least temporarily. But what is
needed is a vivid and sustained realization that every time you step on
the throttle, death gets in beside you, hopefully waiting for his chance. . . .

An enterprising judge now and
again sentences reckless drivers to
tour the accident end of a city
morgue. But even a mangled body
on a slab, waxily portraying the
consequences of bad motoring judg
ment, isn't a patch on the scene of
the accident itself. No artist work
ing on a safety poster would dare
depict that in full detail.
That picture would have to in
clude motion-picture and sound ef
fects, too—the flopping, pointless
efforts of the injured to stand up;
the queer, grunting noises; the
steady, panting groaning of a human
being wiih pain creeping up on him
as ihe shock wears off.
It should portray the slack ex
pression on the face of a man,
drugged with shock, staring at the
2-twist in his broken leg, the in
ss crumpled clTect of a child's
body after its bones are crushed
inward, a realistic portrait of an
hysterical woman with her scream
ing mouth opening a hole in the
bloody drip that fills her eyes and
runs off her chin. . . .
Those are all standard, everyday
sequels to the modern passion for
going places in a hurry and taking a
chance or two by the way. . . .
Last year a state trooper of my
acquaintance stopped a big red His
pano for speeding. Papa was ob
viously a responsible pet-son ... so
the officer cut into his well-bred
expostulations: "I'll let you off this
time. . . . Get going—but take it
easier." Later a passing motorist
asked if the red Hispano had got a
ticket. "No," said the trooper, "I
hated to spoil their party." "Too bad
you didn't," said the motorist, "I
saw you stop them—and then I
passed that ear again 50 miles up
the line. . . . The car was all folded
up like an accordion—the color was
about all there was left. They were
all dead but one of the kids—and he
wasn't going to live to the hospital."
. .. Unjess you're a heavy-footed
incurable, a good look at the pic
ture the artist wouldn't dare to

paint, a first-hand acquaintance
with the results of mixing gasoline
with speed and had judgment,
ought to he well worth your
while. . . .
Collision, turnover or sideswipe,
each type of accident produces ei
ther a shattering dead stop or a
crashing change of direction —and,
since the occupant—meaning you—
continues in the old direction at the
original speed, every surface and
angle of. the car's interior immedi
ately becomes a battering, tearing
projectile, aimed squarely at you—
inescapable. . . .
It's like going over Niagara Falls
in a steel barrel full of railroad
spikes. The best thing that can hap
pen to you—and one of the rarer
things—is to be thrown out as the
doors spring open, so you have only
the ground to reckon with. ... At
least you are spared the lethal array
of gleaming metal knobs and edges
and glass inside the car.
Anything can happen in that
split second of crash, even those
lucky escapes you hear about.
People . . . have ritn cars to
gether head on, reducing both to
twisted junk, and been found un
hurt and arguing bitterly two
minutes afterward. But death was
there just the same—he was only
exercising his privilege of being
erratic. ... A wrecking crew pried
the door off a car which had been

► overturned down an embank
ment and out stepped the driver
with only a scratch on his cheek.
But his mother was still inside, a
splinter of wood driven four inch
es into her brain. . . .
On that same curve a month later,
a light touring car crashed a tree.
In the middle of the front seat they
found a nine-months-old baby . . .
absolutely unhurt. A fine practical
joke on death—but spoiled by the
baby's parents, still sitting on each
side of him, instantly killed by shat
tering their skulis on the dashboard.
If you customarily pass without
clear vision a long way ahead, make
sure that every member of the party
carries identification papers — it's
difficult to identify a body with its
whole face bashed in or toin off.
The driver is death's favorite target,
if the steering wheel holds together
; t ruptures his liver or spleen so he
bleeds to death internally. Or, if the
steering wheel breaks off, the matter
is settled instantly by the steering
column's plunging through his ab
domen.
By no means do all head-on col
lisions occur on curves. The modern
death-trap is likely to be a straight
stretch with three lanes of traffic.
. . . This sudden vision of broad,
straight roads tempts many an ordi
narily sensible driver into passing
the man ahead. Simultaneously a
driver coming the other way swings
out. At the last moment each tries
to get into line again, but the gaps
are closed. . . . The passers meet,
almost head on, in a swirling, grind
ing smash that sends them caroming
obliquely into the other.
A trooper described such an ac
cident . . . the quick way the
doctor turned away from a dead
man to chcck up on a woman with
a broken back; the three bodies
out of one car so soaked with oil
from the crankcase that they
looked like wet brown cigars and
not human at all: a man, walking
around and babbling to himself,
oblivious of the dead and dying,
even oblivious of the dagger-like
sliver of steel that stuck out of
his streaming wrist; a pretty girl
with her forehead laid open, trying

hopelessly to crawl out of a ditch 4
in spite of her smashed hip. . . .
Each shattered man, woman or
child who went to make up the
36,000 corpses chalked up last year
had to die a personal death.
A car careening down a bank . . .
can wrap itself so thoroughly around

a tree that front and rear bumpers
interlock. ... In a recent case of j
that sort they found the old lady, j
who had been sitting in back, lying j
across tho lap of her daughter, who |
was in front, each soaked in her j
own and the other's blood indis
tinguishably, each so shattered and j
broken that there was no point 1

► whatever in an autopsy to deter- I
mine whether it»was broken neck or
ruptured heart that caused death. . . . j
Flying glass contributes much
more than its share to the spectacu- |
lar side of accidents. It doesn't j
merely cut — the fragments are I
driven in as if a cannon loaded with
broken bottles had been fired in
your face, and a sliver in the eye, I
traveling wiih such force, means j
certain blindness. A leg or arm
stuck through the wind-shield will
cut clean to the bone . . . like a
piece of beef under the butcher*
knife . . .
You hear picturesque tales of
how a flying human hotly will
make a neat hole in safety glass
with its head—the shoulder's
stick—the glass holds—and the i
raw, keen edge of the hole de- i
capitates the body as neatly as a I
guillotine.
Or, to continue with the decapi- i
tation motif, going off Lh-? road into
a post-and-rail fence can put you
beyond worrying about other injur
ies immediately when a rail comes
through the windshield and tears oft
your head with its splintery end— |
not as neat a job but thoroughly \
efficient. . . .
I


But all that is routine in every
American community. To be re
membered by doctors and police
men, you have to do something as
grotesque as the lady who burst
the windshield wth her head, splash
ing splinters all over the other oc
cupants of the car, and then, as the
car rolled over, rolled with it down
the edge of the windshield frame
and cut her throat from ear to ear.
Or park on the pavement too
near a curve at night and stand
in front of the tail light as you
take olf the spare tire—which will
immortalize you in somebody's
memory as the fellow who was
smashed three feet broad and two
inches thick by the impact of a
heavy duty truck against the rear
of his own car.
Or be as original as the pair of
youths who were thrown out of an
open roadster this spring—thrown
clear—but each broke a windshield
post with his head in passing and
the whole top of each skull, down to
the eyebrows, was missing. Or snap
off a nine-inch tree and get yourself
impaled by a ragged branch. . , .
It's harti to find a surviving acci
dent victim who can bear to talk.
Alter you come to, . . . the pain can
distract you . . . from realizing that
you are probably on your way out..
You can't forget that, not even
when they shift you from the ground
to the stretcher and your broken
ribs bite into your lungs and the
sharp ends of your collarbones slide
over to stab deep into each side of
your screaming throat. ... It all
comes back — you're dying and you
hate yourself for it. That isn't fic

i tion. It's what it actually feels like
to be one of that 36,000.
And every time you pass on a
I blind curve, every time you hit it
up on a slippery road, every time
| you step on it harder than your
' reflexes will safely take, every
time you drive with your reac
tions slowed down by a drink or
I two, every time you follow the
! man ahead too closely, you're
l gambling a few seconds against
i this kind of blood and agony and
; sudden death.
Take a look at yourself as the man
! in the white jacket shakes his head
over you, tells the boys with the
stretcher not to bother and turns
away to somebody else who isn't
quite dead yet. And then take it
easy.
Two honor societies at Beverly
Hills High School recently chartered
a thirteen-car train with dancing
facilities to take 700 rooters to San
Diego for a football game.

Publicizing the total of motoring injuries—almost a million last year,
with 36,000 deaths—never gets to first base in jarring the motorist into
a realization of the appalling risks of motoring. He does not translate dry
statistics into a reality of blood and agony.
Figures exclude the pain and horror of savage mutilation—which means
they leave out the point. ... A passing look at a bad smash . . , will make
any driver but a born fool slow down at least temporarily. But what is
needed is a vivid and sustained realization that every time you step on
the throttle, death gets in beside you, hopefully waiting for his chance. . . .

An enterprising judge now and
again sentences reckless drivers to
tour the accident end of a city
morgue. But even a mangled body
on a slab, waxily portraying the
consequences of bad motoring judg
ment, isn't a patch on the scene of
the accident itself. No artist work
ing on a safety poster would dare
depict that in full detail.
That picture would have to in
clude motion-picture and sound ef
fects, too—the flopping, pointless
efforts of the injured to stand up;
the queer, grunting noises; the
steady, panting groaning of a human
being wiih pain creeping up on him
as ihe shock wears off.
It should portray the slack ex
pression on the face of a man,
drugged with shock, staring at the
2-twist in his broken leg, the in
ss crumpled clTect of a child's
body after its bones are crushed
inward, a realistic portrait of an
hysterical woman with her scream
ing mouth opening a hole in the
bloody drip that fills her eyes and
runs off her chin. . . .
Those are all standard, everyday
sequels to the modern passion for
going places in a hurry and taking a
chance or two by the way. . . .
Last year a state trooper of my
acquaintance stopped a big red His
pano for speeding. Papa was ob
viously a responsible pet-son ... so
the officer cut into his well-bred
expostulations: "I'll let you off this
time. . . . Get going—but take it
easier." Later a passing motorist
asked if the red Hispano had got a
ticket. "No," said the trooper, "I
hated to spoil their party." "Too bad
you didn't," said the motorist, "I
saw you stop them—and then I
passed that ear again 50 miles up
the line. . . . The car was all folded
up like an accordion—the color was
about all there was left. They were
all dead but one of the kids—and he
wasn't going to live to the hospital."
. .. Unjess you're a heavy-footed
incurable, a good look at the pic
ture the artist wouldn't dare to

Collision, turnover or sideswipe,
each type of accident produces ei
ther a shattering dead stop or a
crashing change of direction —and,
since the occupant—meaning you—
continues in the old direction at the
original speed, every surface and
angle of. the car's interior immedi
ately becomes a battering, tearing
projectile, aimed squarely at you—
inescapable. . . .
It's like going over Niagara Falls
in a steel barrel full of railroad
spikes. The best thing that can hap
pen to you—and one of the rarer
things—is to be thrown out as the
doors spring open, so you have only
the ground to reckon with. ... At
least you are spared the lethal array
of gleaming metal knobs and edges
and glass inside the car.
Anything can happen in that
split second of crash, even those
lucky escapes you hear about.
People . . . have ritn cars to
gether head on, reducing both to
twisted junk, and been found un
hurt and arguing bitterly two
minutes afterward. But death was
there just the same—he was only
exercising his privilege of being
erratic. ... A wrecking crew pried
the door off a car which had been

► overturned down an embank
ment and out stepped the driver
with only a scratch on his cheek.
But his mother was still inside, a
splinter of wood driven four inch
es into her brain. . . .
On that same curve a month later,
a light touring car crashed a tree.
In the middle of the front seat they
found a nine-months-old baby . . .
absolutely unhurt. A fine practical
joke on death—but spoiled by the
baby's parents, still sitting on each
side of him, instantly killed by shat
tering their skulis on the dashboard.
If you customarily pass without
clear vision a long way ahead, make
sure that every member of the party
carries identification papers — it's
difficult to identify a body with its
whole face bashed in or toin off.
The driver is death's favorite target,
if the steering wheel holds together
; t ruptures his liver or spleen so he
bleeds to death internally. Or, if the
steering wheel breaks off, the matter
is settled instantly by the steering

domen.

death-trap is likely to be a straight
stretch with three lanes of traffic.
. . . This sudden vision of broad,
straight roads tempts many an ordi
narily sensible driver into passing
the man ahead. Simultaneously a
driver coming the other way swings
out. At the last moment each tries
to get into line again, but the gaps
are closed. . . . The passers meet,
almost head on, in a swirling, grind
ing smash that sends them caroming
obliquely into the other.
A trooper described such an ac
cident . . . the quick way the

man to chcck up on a woman with
a broken back; the three bodies

looked like wet brown cigars and
not human at all: a man, walking
around and babbling to himself,
oblivious of the dead and dying,
even oblivious of the dagger-like
sliver of steel that stuck out of
his streaming wrist; a pretty girl
with her forehead laid open, trying

hopelessly to crawl out of a ditch 4

But all that is routine in every
American community. To be re

men, you have to do something as
grotesque as the lady who burst
the windshield wth her head, splash
ing splinters all over the other oc
cupants of the car, and then, as the
car rolled over, rolled with it down
the edge of the windshield frame
and cut her throat from ear to ear.

near a curve at night and stand
in front of the tail light as you
take olf the spare tire—which will
immortalize you in somebody's
memory as the fellow who was
smashed three feet broad and two
inches thick by the impact of a
heavy duty truck against the rear
of his own car.
Or be as original as the pair of
youths who were thrown out of an
open roadster this spring—thrown
clear—but each broke a windshield
post with his head in passing and
the whole top of each skull, down to
the eyebrows, was missing. Or snap
off a nine-inch tree and get yourself
impaled by a ragged branch. . , .
It's harti to find a surviving acci
dent victim who can bear to talk.
Alter you come to, . . . the pain can
distract you . . . from realizing that
you are probably on your way out..
You can't forget that, not even
when they shift you from the ground
to the stretcher and your broken
ribs bite into your lungs and the
sharp ends of your collarbones slide
over to stab deep into each side of
your screaming throat. ... It all

smashed three feet broad and two
inches thick by the impact of a
heavy duty truck against the rear
of his own car.
Or be as original as the pair of
youths who were thrown out of an
open roadster this spring—thrown
clear—but each broke a windshield
post with his head in passing and
the whole top of each skull, down to
the eyebrows, was missing. Or snap
off a nine-inch tree and get yourself

It's harti to find a surviving acci

sharp ends of your collarbones slide
over to stab deep into each side of

Publicizing the total of motoring injuries—almost a million last year,
with 36,000 deaths—never gets to first base in jarring the motorist into
a realization of the appalling risks of motoring. He does not translate dry
statistics into a reality of blood and agony.
Figures exclude the pain and horror of savage mutilation—which means
they leave out the point. ... A passing look at a bad smash . . , will make
any driver but a born fool slow down at least temporarily. But what is
needed is a vivid and sustained realization that every time you step on
the throttle, death gets in beside you, hopefully waiting for his chance. . . .

An enterprising judge now and
again sentences reckless drivers to
tour the accident end of a city
morgue. But even a mangled body
on a slab, waxily portraying the
consequences of bad motoring judg
ment, isn't a patch on the scene of
the accident itself. No artist work
ing on a safety poster would dare
depict that in full detail.
That picture would have to in
clude motion-picture and sound ef
fects, too—the flopping, pointless
efforts of the injured to stand up;
the queer, grunting noises; the
steady, panting groaning of a human
being wiih pain creeping up on him
as ihe shock wears off.
It should portray the slack ex
pression on the face of a man,
drugged with shock, staring at the
2-twist in his broken leg, the in
ss crumpled clTect of a child's
body after its bones are crushed
inward, a realistic portrait of an
hysterical woman with her scream
ing mouth opening a hole in the
bloody drip that fills her eyes and
runs off her chin. . . .
Those are all standard, everyday
sequels to the modern passion for
going places in a hurry and taking a
chance or two by the way. . . .
Last year a state trooper of my
acquaintance stopped a big red His
pano for speeding. Papa was ob
viously a responsible pet-son ... so
the officer cut into his well-bred
expostulations: "I'll let you off this
time. . . . Get going—but take it
easier." Later a passing motorist
asked if the red Hispano had got a
ticket. "No," said the trooper, "I
hated to spoil their party." "Too bad
you didn't," said the motorist, "I
saw you stop them—and then I
passed that ear again 50 miles up
the line. . . . The car was all folded
up like an accordion—the color was
about all there was left. They were
all dead but one of the kids—and he
wasn't going to live to the hospital."
. .. Unjess you're a heavy-footed
incurable, a good look at the pic
ture the artist wouldn't dare to

paint, a first-hand acquaintance
with the results of mixing gasoline
with speed and had judgment,
ought to he well worth your
while. . . .
Collision, turnover or sideswipe,
each type of accident produces ei
ther a shattering dead stop or a
crashing change of direction —and,
since the occupant—meaning you—
continues in the old direction at the
original speed, every surface and
angle of. the car's interior immedi
ately becomes a battering, tearing
projectile, aimed squarely at you—
inescapable. . . .
It's like going over Niagara Falls
in a steel barrel full of railroad
spikes. The best thing that can hap
pen to you—and one of the rarer
things—is to be thrown out as the
doors spring open, so you have only
the ground to reckon with. ... At
least you are spared the lethal array
of gleaming metal knobs and edges
and glass inside the car.
Anything can happen in that
split second of crash, even those
lucky escapes you hear about.
People . . . have ritn cars to
gether head on, reducing both to
twisted junk, and been found un
hurt and arguing bitterly two
minutes afterward. But death was
there just the same—he was only
exercising his privilege of being
erratic. ... A wrecking crew pried
the door off a car which had been

► overturned down an embank
ment and out stepped the driver
with only a scratch on his cheek.
But his mother was still inside, a
splinter of wood driven four inch
es into her brain. . . .
On that same curve a month later,
a light touring car crashed a tree.
In the middle of the front seat they
found a nine-months-old baby . . .
absolutely unhurt. A fine practical
joke on death—but spoiled by the
baby's parents, still sitting on each
side of him, instantly killed by shat
tering their skulis on the dashboard.
If you customarily pass without
clear vision a long way ahead, make
sure that every member of the party
carries identification papers — it's
difficult to identify a body with its
whole face bashed in or toin off.
The driver is death's favorite target,
if the steering wheel holds together
; t ruptures his liver or spleen so he
bleeds to death internally. Or, if the
steering wheel breaks off, the matter
is settled instantly by the steering
column's plunging through his ab
domen.
By no means do all head-on col
lisions occur on curves. The modern
death-trap is likely to be a straight
stretch with three lanes of traffic.
. . . This sudden vision of broad,
straight roads tempts many an ordi
narily sensible driver into passing
the man ahead. Simultaneously a
driver coming the other way swings
out. At the last moment each tries
to get into line again, but the gaps
are closed. . . . The passers meet,
almost head on, in a swirling, grind
ing smash that sends them caroming
obliquely into the other.
A trooper described such an ac
cident . . . the quick way the
doctor turned away from a dead
man to chcck up on a woman with
a broken back; the three bodies
out of one car so soaked with oil
from the crankcase that they
looked like wet brown cigars and
not human at all: a man, walking
around and babbling to himself,
oblivious of the dead and dying,
even oblivious of the dagger-like
sliver of steel that stuck out of
his streaming wrist; a pretty girl
with her forehead laid open, trying

hopelessly to crawl out of a ditch 4
in spite of her smashed hip. . . .
Each shattered man, woman or
child who went to make up the
36,000 corpses chalked up last year
had to die a personal death.

who had been sitting in back, lying j

was in front, each soaked in her j

stuck through the wind-shield will
cut clean to the bone . . . like a

You hear picturesque tales of
how a flying human hotly will
make a neat hole in safety glass
with its head—the shoulder's
stick—the glass holds—and the i
raw, keen edge of the hole de- i

guillotine.
Or, to continue with the decapi- i
tation motif, going off Lh-? road into

But all that is routine in every
American community. To be re
membered by doctors and police
men, you have to do something as
grotesque as the lady who burst
the windshield wth her head, splash
ing splinters all over the other oc
cupants of the car, and then, as the
car rolled over, rolled with it down
the edge of the windshield frame
and cut her throat from ear to ear.

But all that is routine in every
American community. To be re
membered by doctors and police
men, you have to do something as
grotesque as the lady who burst
the windshield wth her head, splash
ing splinters all over the other oc
cupants of the car, and then, as the
car rolled over, rolled with it down
the edge of the windshield frame
and cut her throat from ear to ear.
Or park on the pavement too
near a curve at night and stand
in front of the tail light as you
take olf the spare tire—which will
immortalize you in somebody's
memory as the fellow who was
smashed three feet broad and two
inches thick by the impact of a
heavy duty truck against the rear
of his own car.
Or be as original as the pair of
youths who were thrown out of an
open roadster this spring—thrown
clear—but each broke a windshield
post with his head in passing and
the whole top of each skull, down to
the eyebrows, was missing. Or snap
off a nine-inch tree and get yourself
impaled by a ragged branch. . , .
It's harti to find a surviving acci
dent victim who can bear to talk.
Alter you come to, . . . the pain can
distract you . . . from realizing that
you are probably on your way out..
You can't forget that, not even
when they shift you from the ground
to the stretcher and your broken
ribs bite into your lungs and the
sharp ends of your collarbones slide
over to stab deep into each side of
your screaming throat. ... It all
comes back — you're dying and you
hate yourself for it. That isn't fic

i tion. It's what it actually feels like
to be one of that 36,000.
And every time you pass on a
I blind curve, every time you hit it
up on a slippery road, every time
| you step on it harder than your
' reflexes will safely take, every
time you drive with your reac
tions slowed down by a drink or
I two, every time you follow the
! man ahead too closely, you're
l gambling a few seconds against
i this kind of blood and agony and
; sudden death.
Take a look at yourself as the man
! in the white jacket shakes his head
over you, tells the boys with the
stretcher not to bother and turns
away to somebody else who isn't
quite dead yet. And then take it
easy.

Publicizing the total of motoring injuries—almost a million last year,
with 36,000 deaths—never gets to first base in jarring the motorist into
a realization of the appalling risks of motoring. He does not translate dry
statistics into a reality of blood and agony.
Figures exclude the pain and horror of savage mutilation—which means
they leave out the point. ... A passing look at a bad smash . . , will make
any driver but a born fool slow down at least temporarily. But what is
needed is a vivid and sustained realization that every time you step on
the throttle, death gets in beside you, hopefully waiting for his chance. . . .

An enterprising judge now and
again sentences reckless drivers to
tour the accident end of a city
morgue. But even a mangled body
on a slab, waxily portraying the
consequences of bad motoring judg
ment, isn't a patch on the scene of
the accident itself. No artist work
ing on a safety poster would dare
depict that in full detail.
That picture would have to in
clude motion-picture and sound ef
fects, too—the flopping, pointless
efforts of the injured to stand up;
the queer, grunting noises; the
steady, panting groaning of a human
being wiih pain creeping up on him
as ihe shock wears off.
It should portray the slack ex
pression on the face of a man,
drugged with shock, staring at the
2-twist in his broken leg, the in
ss crumpled clTect of a child's
body after its bones are crushed
inward, a realistic portrait of an
hysterical woman with her scream
ing mouth opening a hole in the
bloody drip that fills her eyes and
runs off her chin. . . .
Those are all standard, everyday
sequels to the modern passion for
going places in a hurry and taking a
chance or two by the way. . . .
Last year a state trooper of my
acquaintance stopped a big red His
pano for speeding. Papa was ob
viously a responsible pet-son ... so
the officer cut into his well-bred
expostulations: "I'll let you off this
time. . . . Get going—but take it
easier." Later a passing motorist
asked if the red Hispano had got a
ticket. "No," said the trooper, "I
hated to spoil their party." "Too bad
you didn't," said the motorist, "I
saw you stop them—and then I
passed that ear again 50 miles up
the line. . . . The car was all folded
up like an accordion—the color was
about all there was left. They were
all dead but one of the kids—and he
wasn't going to live to the hospital."
. .. Unjess you're a heavy-footed
incurable, a good look at the pic
ture the artist wouldn't dare to

paint, a first-hand acquaintance
with the results of mixing gasoline
with speed and had judgment,
ought to he well worth your
while. . . .
Collision, turnover or sideswipe,
each type of accident produces ei
ther a shattering dead stop or a
crashing change of direction —and,
since the occupant—meaning you—
continues in the old direction at the
original speed, every surface and
angle of. the car's interior immedi
ately becomes a battering, tearing
projectile, aimed squarely at you—
inescapable. . . .
It's like going over Niagara Falls
in a steel barrel full of railroad
spikes. The best thing that can hap
pen to you—and one of the rarer
things—is to be thrown out as the
doors spring open, so you have only
the ground to reckon with. ... At
least you are spared the lethal array
of gleaming metal knobs and edges
and glass inside the car.
Anything can happen in that
split second of crash, even those
lucky escapes you hear about.
People . . . have ritn cars to
gether head on, reducing both to
twisted junk, and been found un
hurt and arguing bitterly two
minutes afterward. But death was
there just the same—he was only
exercising his privilege of being
erratic. ... A wrecking crew pried
the door off a car which had been

► overturned down an embank
ment and out stepped the driver
with only a scratch on his cheek.
But his mother was still inside, a
splinter of wood driven four inch
es into her brain. . . .
On that same curve a month later,
a light touring car crashed a tree.
In the middle of the front seat they
found a nine-months-old baby . . .
absolutely unhurt. A fine practical
joke on death—but spoiled by the
baby's parents, still sitting on each
side of him, instantly killed by shat
tering their skulis on the dashboard.
If you customarily pass without
clear vision a long way ahead, make
sure that every member of the party
carries identification papers — it's
difficult to identify a body with its
whole face bashed in or toin off.
The driver is death's favorite target,
if the steering wheel holds together
; t ruptures his liver or spleen so he
bleeds to death internally. Or, if the
steering wheel breaks off, the matter
is settled instantly by the steering
column's plunging through his ab
domen.
By no means do all head-on col
lisions occur on curves. The modern
death-trap is likely to be a straight
stretch with three lanes of traffic.
. . . This sudden vision of broad,
straight roads tempts many an ordi
narily sensible driver into passing
the man ahead. Simultaneously a
driver coming the other way swings
out. At the last moment each tries
to get into line again, but the gaps
are closed. . . . The passers meet,
almost head on, in a swirling, grind
ing smash that sends them caroming
obliquely into the other.
A trooper described such an ac
cident . . . the quick way the
doctor turned away from a dead
man to chcck up on a woman with
a broken back; the three bodies
out of one car so soaked with oil
from the crankcase that they
looked like wet brown cigars and
not human at all: a man, walking
around and babbling to himself,
oblivious of the dead and dying,
even oblivious of the dagger-like
sliver of steel that stuck out of
his streaming wrist; a pretty girl
with her forehead laid open, trying

hopelessly to crawl out of a ditch 4
in spite of her smashed hip. . . .
Each shattered man, woman or
child who went to make up the
36,000 corpses chalked up last year
had to die a personal death.
A car careening down a bank . . .
can wrap itself so thoroughly around

a tree that front and rear bumpers
interlock. ... In a recent case of j
that sort they found the old lady, j
who had been sitting in back, lying j
across tho lap of her daughter, who |
was in front, each soaked in her j
own and the other's blood indis
tinguishably, each so shattered and j
broken that there was no point 1

Flying glass contributes much
more than its share to the spectacu- |
lar side of accidents. It doesn't j
merely cut — the fragments are I
driven in as if a cannon loaded with

traveling wiih such force, means j
certain blindness. A leg or arm
stuck through the wind-shield will
cut clean to the bone . . . like a
piece of beef under the butcher*
knife . . .
You hear picturesque tales of
how a flying human hotly will
make a neat hole in safety glass
with its head—the shoulder's
stick—the glass holds—and the i

grotesque as the lady who burst

car rolled over, rolled with it down
the edge of the windshield frame

inches thick by the impact of a
heavy duty truck against the rear
of his own car.
Or be as original as the pair of
youths who were thrown out of an
open roadster this spring—thrown
clear—but each broke a windshield
post with his head in passing and
the whole top of each skull, down to
the eyebrows, was missing. Or snap
off a nine-inch tree and get yourself

You can't forget that, not even
when they shift you from the ground
to the stretcher and your broken
ribs bite into your lungs and the
sharp ends of your collarbones slide
over to stab deep into each side of
your screaming throat. ... It all
comes back — you're dying and you
hate yourself for it. That isn't fic

i tion. It's what it actually feels like
to be one of that 36,000.
And every time you pass on a
I blind curve, every time you hit it
up on a slippery road, every time

I two, every time you follow the

l gambling a few seconds against
i this kind of blood and agony and

Take a look at yourself as the man

Publicizing the total of motoring injuries—almost a million last year,
with 36,000 deaths—never gets to first base in jarring the motorist into
a realization of the appalling risks of motoring. He does not translate dry
statistics into a reality of blood and agony.
Figures exclude the pain and horror of savage mutilation—which means
they leave out the point. ... A passing look at a bad smash . . , will make
any driver but a born fool slow down at least temporarily. But what is
needed is a vivid and sustained realization that every time you step on
the throttle, death gets in beside you, hopefully waiting for his chance. . . .

An enterprising judge now and
again sentences reckless drivers to
tour the accident end of a city
morgue. But even a mangled body
on a slab, waxily portraying the
consequences of bad motoring judg
ment, isn't a patch on the scene of
the accident itself. No artist work
ing on a safety poster would dare
depict that in full detail.
That picture would have to in
clude motion-picture and sound ef
fects, too—the flopping, pointless
efforts of the injured to stand up;
the queer, grunting noises; the
steady, panting groaning of a human
being wiih pain creeping up on him
as ihe shock wears off.
It should portray the slack ex
pression on the face of a man,
drugged with shock, staring at the
2-twist in his broken leg, the in
ss crumpled clTect of a child's
body after its bones are crushed
inward, a realistic portrait of an
hysterical woman with her scream
ing mouth opening a hole in the
bloody drip that fills her eyes and
runs off her chin. . . .
Those are all standard, everyday
sequels to the modern passion for
going places in a hurry and taking a
chance or two by the way. . . .
Last year a state trooper of my
acquaintance stopped a big red His
pano for speeding. Papa was ob
viously a responsible pet-son ... so
the officer cut into his well-bred
expostulations: "I'll let you off this
time. . . . Get going—but take it
easier." Later a passing motorist
asked if the red Hispano had got a
ticket. "No," said the trooper, "I
hated to spoil their party." "Too bad
you didn't," said the motorist, "I
saw you stop them—and then I
passed that ear again 50 miles up
the line. . . . The car was all folded
up like an accordion—the color was
about all there was left. They were
all dead but one of the kids—and he
wasn't going to live to the hospital."
. .. Unjess you're a heavy-footed
incurable, a good look at the pic
ture the artist wouldn't dare to

paint, a first-hand acquaintance
with the results of mixing gasoline
with speed and had judgment,
ought to he well worth your
while. . . .
Collision, turnover or sideswipe,
each type of accident produces ei
ther a shattering dead stop or a
crashing change of direction —and,
since the occupant—meaning you—
continues in the old direction at the
original speed, every surface and
angle of. the car's interior immedi
ately becomes a battering, tearing
projectile, aimed squarely at you—
inescapable. . . .
It's like going over Niagara Falls
in a steel barrel full of railroad
spikes. The best thing that can hap
pen to you—and one of the rarer
things—is to be thrown out as the
doors spring open, so you have only
the ground to reckon with. ... At
least you are spared the lethal array
of gleaming metal knobs and edges
and glass inside the car.
Anything can happen in that
split second of crash, even those
lucky escapes you hear about.
People . . . have ritn cars to
gether head on, reducing both to
twisted junk, and been found un
hurt and arguing bitterly two
minutes afterward. But death was
there just the same—he was only
exercising his privilege of being
erratic. ... A wrecking crew pried
the door off a car which had been

► overturned down an embank
ment and out stepped the driver
with only a scratch on his cheek.
But his mother was still inside, a
splinter of wood driven four inch
es into her brain. . . .
On that same curve a month later,
a light touring car crashed a tree.
In the middle of the front seat they
found a nine-months-old baby . . .
absolutely unhurt. A fine practical
joke on death—but spoiled by the
baby's parents, still sitting on each
side of him, instantly killed by shat
tering their skulis on the dashboard.
If you customarily pass without
clear vision a long way ahead, make
sure that every member of the party
carries identification papers — it's
difficult to identify a body with its
whole face bashed in or toin off.
The driver is death's favorite target,
if the steering wheel holds together
; t ruptures his liver or spleen so he
bleeds to death internally. Or, if the
steering wheel breaks off, the matter
is settled instantly by the steering
column's plunging through his ab
domen.
By no means do all head-on col
lisions occur on curves. The modern
death-trap is likely to be a straight
stretch with three lanes of traffic.
. . . This sudden vision of broad,
straight roads tempts many an ordi
narily sensible driver into passing
the man ahead. Simultaneously a
driver coming the other way swings
out. At the last moment each tries
to get into line again, but the gaps
are closed. . . . The passers meet,
almost head on, in a swirling, grind
ing smash that sends them caroming
obliquely into the other.
A trooper described such an ac
cident . . . the quick way the
doctor turned away from a dead
man to chcck up on a woman with
a broken back; the three bodies
out of one car so soaked with oil
from the crankcase that they
looked like wet brown cigars and
not human at all: a man, walking
around and babbling to himself,
oblivious of the dead and dying,
even oblivious of the dagger-like
sliver of steel that stuck out of
his streaming wrist; a pretty girl
with her forehead laid open, trying

hopelessly to crawl out of a ditch 4
in spite of her smashed hip. . . .
Each shattered man, woman or
child who went to make up the
36,000 corpses chalked up last year
had to die a personal death.

a broken back; the three bodies
out of one car so soaked with oil
from the crankcase that they
looked like wet brown cigars and
not human at all: a man, walking
around and babbling to himself,
oblivious of the dead and dying,
even oblivious of the dagger-like
sliver of steel that stuck out of
his streaming wrist; a pretty girl
with her forehead laid open, trying

hopelessly to crawl out of a ditch 4
in spite of her smashed hip. . . .
Each shattered man, woman or
child who went to make up the
36,000 corpses chalked up last year
had to die a personal death.
A car careening down a bank . . .
can wrap itself so thoroughly around

a tree that front and rear bumpers
interlock. ... In a recent case of j
that sort they found the old lady, j
who had been sitting in back, lying j
across tho lap of her daughter, who |
was in front, each soaked in her j
own and the other's blood indis
tinguishably, each so shattered and j
broken that there was no point 1

► whatever in an autopsy to deter- I
mine whether it»was broken neck or
ruptured heart that caused death. . . . j
Flying glass contributes much
more than its share to the spectacu- |
lar side of accidents. It doesn't j
merely cut — the fragments are I
driven in as if a cannon loaded with
broken bottles had been fired in
your face, and a sliver in the eye, I
traveling wiih such force, means j
certain blindness. A leg or arm
stuck through the wind-shield will
cut clean to the bone . . . like a
piece of beef under the butcher*
knife . . .
You hear picturesque tales of
how a flying human hotly will
make a neat hole in safety glass
with its head—the shoulder's
stick—the glass holds—and the i
raw, keen edge of the hole de- i
capitates the body as neatly as a I
guillotine.
Or, to continue with the decapi- i
tation motif, going off Lh-? road into
a post-and-rail fence can put you
beyond worrying about other injur
ies immediately when a rail comes
through the windshield and tears oft
your head with its splintery end— |
not as neat a job but thoroughly \
efficient. . . .

But all that is routine in every
American community. To be re
membered by doctors and police
men, you have to do something as
grotesque as the lady who burst
the windshield wth her head, splash
ing splinters all over the other oc
cupants of the car, and then, as the
car rolled over, rolled with it down
the edge of the windshield frame
and cut her throat from ear to ear.
Or park on the pavement too
near a curve at night and stand
in front of the tail light as you
take olf the spare tire—which will
immortalize you in somebody's
memory as the fellow who was
smashed three feet broad and two
inches thick by the impact of a
heavy duty truck against the rear
of his own car.
Or be as original as the pair of
youths who were thrown out of an
open roadster this spring—thrown
clear—but each broke a windshield
post with his head in passing and
the whole top of each skull, down to
the eyebrows, was missing. Or snap
off a nine-inch tree and get yourself
impaled by a ragged branch. . , .
It's harti to find a surviving acci
dent victim who can bear to talk.
Alter you come to, . . . the pain can
distract you . . . from realizing that
you are probably on your way out..
You can't forget that, not even
when they shift you from the ground
to the stretcher and your broken
ribs bite into your lungs and the
sharp ends of your collarbones slide
over to stab deep into each side of
your screaming throat. ... It all
comes back — you're dying and you
hate yourself for it. That isn't fic

i tion. It's what it actually feels like
to be one of that 36,000.
And every time you pass on a
I blind curve, every time you hit it
up on a slippery road, every time
| you step on it harder than your
' reflexes will safely take, every
time you drive with your reac
tions slowed down by a drink or
I two, every time you follow the
! man ahead too closely, you're
l gambling a few seconds against
i this kind of blood and agony and
; sudden death.
Take a look at yourself as the man
! in the white jacket shakes his head
over you, tells the boys with the
stretcher not to bother and turns
away to somebody else who isn't
quite dead yet. And then take it
easy.
Two honor societies at Beverly
Hills High School recently chartered
a thirteen-car train with dancing
facilities to take 700 rooters to San
Diego for a football game.
