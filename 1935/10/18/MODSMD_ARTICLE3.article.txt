### 
PARIS, Oct. 17 (VP). —France prob
ably will say yes with reservations
Monday to Great Britain's demand
for a showdown on whether French
warships will come to her aid if she
is attacked by Italy in the turbulent
Mediterranean, officials conceded
tonight.
The premier informed observ
ers believed, will call his Cabinet
into session Monday morning to
ratify such a promise.
He has delayed answering Brit
ain's warning that France "must
choose between Italy and the league"
because of fears the United Kingdom
was seeking to lead France into a
blockade of Mussolini's nation.
Outline Eventualities
Officials, however, indicated a
negative reply to the British de
mand would mean France would
lose British support in any brush
with Germany.
Nevertheless, authoritative ob
servers saw a wide split between the
British and French positions.
Late tonight Laval received the
British Ambassador, Sir George
Russell Clerk, for 20 minutes.
Wants 'Yes'
In British circles it was indicated
Clerk told the Premier Sir Samuel
Hoarse, British foreign secretary,
would like to be able to announce
the French "yes" in the House of
Commons Tuesday.
During the day Rustu Aras, the
Turkish foreign minister, visited
Laval and told him, authoritative
sources said, that Turkey will sup
port sanctions against Italy and also
will deny II Duce's warships the use
of Turkish ports in case the Medi
terranean becomes a war zone.
