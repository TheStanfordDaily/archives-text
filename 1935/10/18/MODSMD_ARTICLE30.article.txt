# Grid Stars Will Debate Convicts at San Quentin
## Grayson and Topping Will Visit Prison Stanford's Team, Coached By Lee Chapin, Is Ready for Clash 
### 
San Quentin inmates will have a |
chance to see two of Stanford's [
famous gridiron stars when Bobby
Grayson and Keith Topping, to- |
gether with Bob Gros, visit the state j
penitentiary to debate three con- I
victs on Sunday afternoon in the
annual Stanford-San Quentin de- I
bate.
The topic for debate is this year's I
intercollegiate question: "Resolved ;
' hat Congress should be permitted |
ry a two-thirds majority vote to j
over-ride any five-to-four decision j
of the Supreme Court declaring a |
law unconstitutional." Grayson,
Topping, and Gros will uphold the
affirmative.
Stars Are Experienced
The two football players are not
new to the platform, for both have
had speaking experience in high
school and since coming to Stanford. I
Gros, with Dave Mellinkoff and Bill
Rogers, last year won the Common- '
wealth Club plaque from California, j
besides managing all debate activi- \
ties, which included a transconti- j
nental tour.
Stanford's representatives have
been practicing under the care of \
Lee Chapin, debate coach, and are j
reported to be ready for their clash ;
with the convicts. At San Quentin, |
the speakers are chosen from the \
pick of the crowd, and are usually j
exceptionally talented debaters.
Convicts Have Edge
In the matter of preparation. J
Chapin remarks that the convicts |
will have the edge, for they have
their whole life to gather material. |
while the Farm boys must suffice j
with a few weeks.
"While we are anxious to win, we 1
feel we ought to give the San Quen- j
tin men a 'break'," said Chapin.
Qualifying rounds for the women's j
golf tournament have been extended (
till Sunday, October 20. Pairings
will be posted on the golf bulletin J
board in the Women's Gym at the
first of the week.
