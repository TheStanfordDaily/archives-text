NASHVILLE, Oct. 17 (/P).â€”Paul
A. Walker, member of the Federal
Communications Commission, said
today that "skillfully devised pro
paganda to discourage and to dis
count, if not to thwart," the com
mission's investigation into tele
phone operations is under way.
"Utility regulation is being put to
the test as never before," declared
the chairman of the commission's
telephone division.
"With what we hope to be the
last barrier to effective regulation
removed by a broadening of the
jurisdiction to include both State
and Federal regulation, pronounced
opposition has arisen to the carry
ing out of that regulation."
