# Bonfire History Begun With 1900 Rugby Game
## 
### Margaret Loud 
The Big Game Bonfire, built each
year by the freshman class, has be
come almost as much of a tradition
as the game itself. Started in 1900,
in the days when rugby took the
place of football, the burning of Cal
in effigy by the light of the Cardi
nals' "red fire" became the climax
of every Big Game rally. The bon
fire was held spasmodically for sev
eral years, sometimes preceding oth
er contests besides those with Cal,
but by 1907 it was a well established
tradition of the Farm.
Premature burning of the bonfire
has occurred four times in Stanford
history, 1901, 1914, 1925, and 1928.
In 1925 it was set off early in the
morning when the freshmen left it
unguarded while they went to get
coffee. However, the fighting Stan
ford spirit came to the fore. The
pyre was rebuilt to become the larg
est one in Farm history, a stack 79
feet high and 30 feet square.
In 1928 the stack was set off by a
time bomb. Students cut all their
classes and in less than 36 hours
raised a 60-foot pile in time for the
rally.
Unsuccessful attempts to fire the
pile, two of them by dropping bombs
from an airplane, were made in
1920, 1922, and 1923.
