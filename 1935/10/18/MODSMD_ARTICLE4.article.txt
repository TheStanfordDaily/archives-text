# St. Mary's In Bond Distress
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 17 (/P).â€”
Reorganization or foreclosure of
$1,370,500 in St. Mary's College
bonds should the college be unable
"to work itself out of its financial
difficulties" assertedly brought about
by "mismanagement and an unduly
heavy investment in football" was
forecast today.
A bondholders' protective com
mittee declared that "while the pres
ent plan is to test whether the col
lege, after instituting constructive
steps can reasonably be expected to
work itself out of its financial diffi
culties, it may be necessary for the
committee to formulate a plan of
reorganization or to foreclose under
the deed of trust."
The committee asked permission
and received it to solicit for return
of bonds in default since July 1, 1934,
arid receive certificates of deposit.
Dean Witter of the firm of Dean
Witter & Co., underwriters of the
issue, declared the college's plight is
attributable to general mismanage
ment, heavy investment in the foot
ball team, decreasing football re
ceipts, small enrollment, difficulty in
collecting tuition fees, and a drop in
value of real property owned by the
college.
