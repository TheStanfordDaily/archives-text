# Sophs Star As Possible New Ail-Americans
## Nation Sees Newcomers In Good 1935 Showing 
### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 18 (/P). — Old
faces and new, sweatsoaked and
gleaming in the heat of the early
fall battles, are on display again in
football's most popular art gallery—
the ball carrying heroes of the col
lege world.
Not for many seasons have so
many youngsters, most of thern
sophomores, risen out of the early
firing to stamp themselves potential
all-Americans, crowding out of the
headlines veterans who had the se
lectors' brows wrinkled last De
cember.
Yale probably has the prize trio
in A1 Hessberg, who made two dazz
ling touchdown runs half the field or
longer against Pennsylvania; Clint
Frank, who raoed fur and away
once; and Charlie Ewart, a sopho
more quarterback who pegged a
couple of forward pass touch
downs to brilliant Larry Kelley.
From nowhere, almost, have come
George Roscoe, to make Minnesota
forget the loss of Pug Lund; Elmore
(Honey) Hackney, fireball in the
powerful Duke attack; Jim Craig,
Oklahoma's triple threat gift to
Army; Tom McGannon, ace in Pur
due's sturdy array; Frank Patrick,
husky young Pittsburgh fullback;
Cince Renzo, carrying more of the
Temple load than the more famous
Dave Smukler, Ray Daugherty, pass
ing and running star in Holly Cross'
might; Mike Kotys, at Villanova, and
Ray (Buzz) Buivid, in Marquette's
high-powered attack.
Veterans who made their marks
last year and even before that have
held up valiantly in many sectors of
the new season, and probably the
most sensational of these, certain to
be a general ail-American choice if
he continues his spectacular play, is
lowa's negro speed demon, Ozzie
Simmons.
In the East, A1 Barabas, hero of
Columbia's Rose Bowl victory over
Stanford as a sophomore, is again

the Lions' offensive ace in his last
year under Lou Little's coaching.
Jay Berwanger, Chicago's iron
man, is still one of the Big Ten's top
stars, while Lloyd Cardwell, even
in the losing cause against Minne
sota, has played a valiant role for
Nebraska. Shakespeare has been
carrying a great part of the Notre
Dame freight.
Good fortune hasn't smiled as
pretty on Stanford's veteran stars
Bobby Grayson and Bones Hamil
ton, but Ken Cotton has been a star
for California in the Far West while
Ted Key was U.C.L.A.'s hero in
Saturday's defeat of Stanford.

high-powered attack.
Veterans who made their marks
last year and even before that have
held up valiantly in many sectors of
the new season, and probably the
most sensational of these, certain to
be a general ail-American choice if
he continues his spectacular play, is
lowa's negro speed demon, Ozzie
Simmons.
In the East, A1 Barabas, hero of
Columbia's Rose Bowl victory over
Stanford as a sophomore, is again

the Lions' offensive ace in his last
year under Lou Little's coaching.
Jay Berwanger, Chicago's iron
man, is still one of the Big Ten's top
stars, while Lloyd Cardwell, even
in the losing cause against Minne

Nebraska. Shakespeare has been

NEW YORK, Oct. 18 (/P). — Old
faces and new, sweatsoaked and
gleaming in the heat of the early
fall battles, are on display again in
football's most popular art gallery—
the ball carrying heroes of the col
lege world.
Not for many seasons have so
many youngsters, most of thern
sophomores, risen out of the early
firing to stamp themselves potential
all-Americans, crowding out of the
headlines veterans who had the se
lectors' brows wrinkled last De
cember.
Yale probably has the prize trio
in A1 Hessberg, who made two dazz
ling touchdown runs half the field or
longer against Pennsylvania; Clint
Frank, who raoed fur and away
once; and Charlie Ewart, a sopho
more quarterback who pegged a
couple of forward pass touch
downs to brilliant Larry Kelley.
From nowhere, almost, have come
George Roscoe, to make Minnesota
forget the loss of Pug Lund; Elmore
(Honey) Hackney, fireball in the
powerful Duke attack; Jim Craig,
Oklahoma's triple threat gift to
Army; Tom McGannon, ace in Pur
due's sturdy array; Frank Patrick,
husky young Pittsburgh fullback;
Cince Renzo, carrying more of the
Temple load than the more famous
Dave Smukler, Ray Daugherty, pass
ing and running star in Holly Cross'
might; Mike Kotys, at Villanova, and
Ray (Buzz) Buivid, in Marquette's
high-powered attack.
