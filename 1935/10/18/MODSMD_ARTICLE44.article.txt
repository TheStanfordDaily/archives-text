## 
### 
MANSFIELD, 0., Oct. 17 (/P). —
Eugene Trushel, 12, was hungry —
i but his love for a pet rabbit was
j greater than hunger.
His parents, Mr. and Mrs. John
| Trushel of Willard, have been on
I relief more than a year. Their food
| ran out last night.
Today the family went without
j breakfast and lunch. As evening ap
i proached and their five children
| grew hungrier, the parents became
| desperate.
Why not kill Eugene's rabbit and
j serve it for supper?
They began a search for Eugene
I to break the bad news.
j But they found his body hanging
from a belt attached to his neck
j and a stair railing.
Mrs. Trushel said she believed the
j youngster overheard their plans to
j kill the rabbit, became despondent
I and committed suicide.
