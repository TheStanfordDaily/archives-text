# Africans Take Fidelity Oath

ADDIS ABABA, Oct. 17 (/P).â€” |
Tens of thousands of soldiers from
the farthest reaches of the empire
today poured into the capital after
ceaseless night-and-day marching
behind their lion-robed chiefs.
Begrimed and sweating from the
fortnight's march, they rushed to
the military field beside the imperial
palace in order to assure Emperor
Haile Selassie of their flaming de
termination never to return home

until the last Italian invader has
been driven from their fatherland.
Bedlam broke out as the vanguard
of warriors reached the imperial
tent. The wild men spun back and
forth in ecstasy gnashing their teeth
and aiming their guns at imaginary
foes. They shouted # their implacable
hatred for the enemy.
Suddenly they hurled their weap
ons at the King's feet and prostrat
ing themselves declared:
"We will drown the baby-killers
in their own blood. We are going to
our death and we are unafraid."

An 81-year-old co-ed received an
M.A. from Claremont College.
