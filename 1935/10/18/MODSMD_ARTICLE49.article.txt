# Stanford Fencers Meet Italian Club
## 
### 
"A close meet," was all Coach El
wyn Bugge could forecast concern
ing tonight's fencing fray when the
Stanford varsity meets the Italian
Club of San Francisco at 8 o'clock
in Encina Gym.
The Latin aggregation of Gamba
delli, Daini, Patri, Cocca, and Gara
delli represents the cream of a num
ber of swordsmen who are con
stantly active at the sport at the city
athletic establishment, and should
provide plenty of competition for
the Stanford quintet of Captain Dick
Ferguson, Louis Lataillade, Jack
Leslie, Dwight Strong, and Langdon
Swent.
