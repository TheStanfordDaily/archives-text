# Water Poloists To Meet Bears
## Cards Defend Clean Slate At Berkeley Evenly Matched Teams Will Tangle For Conference Lead 
### 
Indian water poloists invade- the
lair of the Berkeley Bear tomorrow
morning to enter what promises to
be as sensational a naval engage
ment as has ever been witnessed in
the Bay region.
Stanford boasts an undefeated
squad that will defend the Pacific
Association ;.nd the Pacific Coast
Conference titles. The challenging
Calil'omians boast a well-coached,
powerful offensive machine that is
confident of victory. Never have two
outfits been more evenly matched
and when they clash a whale of a
show is guaranteed.
Hope for Victory
With their slashing offense, the
Farm swimmers hope to turn back
the Bears who threaten their aquatic
supremacy. The Indians' forward
wall, however, may be weakened
somewhat by the absence of Bill
Woodard, one of the co-captains of
the squad, whose punctured ear
drum might keep him out of the
pool. Also there is a possibility that
"Suds" Sutherland will remain on
the sidelines with the cut lip that he
suffered in the Olympic Club tilt
two weeks ago. But if Woodard's
ear can be taped successfully and if
Sutherland's tip has healed enough,
says Coach Nort Thornton, both will
enter the battle.
If they are needed, Bill Hanna
wiil replace Woodard at guard and
Don Peterson will get the call to
substitute for Sutherland.
Cards Hit Stride
Woodard, Wally Wiget, guard, and
Bob Haslacher, goalie, are included
in the aII - Conference trio that
Thornton has been depending upon
to lead the Cardinals to victory.
The Indian offense, although slow in
developing, hit its stride last week
to pile up 5 goals against the strong
Athens Club and 21 against the San
Jose State Teachers.
The varsity squad will meet at 11
o'clock in the California men's gym
nasium.
