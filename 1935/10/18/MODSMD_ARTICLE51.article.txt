Sigma Alpha Epsilon 1, Kappa

Three close games and a forfeit
comprised yesterday's intramural
football results. Jim White's perfect
place-kick won the narrowest vic
tory for the Betas over El Toro, 7
to 6. A Slusser to Morrison pass
gave the Theta Chis a 6-0 triumph
over Sequoia 11.
Forward and lateral passes by
Howell Turner, varsity basketball
star, resulted in a 15-6 win for the
Zetes over the Delta Chis. The
Zetes scored a fluke safety as Reimer
and the Delta Chi's intercepted a
pass, only to fumble out of bounds.
The Kappa Alphas defaulted to the
S.A.E.s in the fourth game sched
uled for yesterday.
