WEEK-END PLAY
AFFECTS STANFORD
Stanford doesn't play a game this
week-end but the future of the In
dian 1935 grid season depends heav
ily on those that do. For if Cali
fornia is upset by Santa Clara and
Washington defeats Washington
State it will be a boon to the injured
and upset forces on Stanford's
Farm.
No, we can't sit back and ex
pect that Lady uck will favor
Stanford with such good fortune
as to have both those games turn
out just as wished. For Cal is
riding high, and will probably
down the Brortcs and there is a
good chance that W.S.C. though,
the underdogs, will upset Jimmy
Phelan's men.
But Lady Luck has been a wqrm
, as far as Stanford is concerned and 1
there is a chance that she, like the j
worm, may still turn—and do it be
fore tomorrow.
PADDOCK MOANS
AT HOWARD JONES
It's hard to believe that Coach
Howard Jones of U.S.C., two years
ago "the finest coach in the U. 5.," |
is already taking it on the chin for ■
not putting out a super-team every
year.
Charles W. Paddock, Trojan
alumnus and great sprinter—"the
fastest human"—takes a mighty
poke at Coach Jones in a public
statement made early this week.
His strong words ignore com
pletely the fact that Jones in the
past has turned out great teams
and has put U.S.C. on top in past
football years.
One or two poor seasons, a strong i
opposition team in Los Angeles, and
Mr. Paddock writes these condemn- '
ing words: I
"He was both a fine coach and a j
fine character builder. Now he seems j
to be little else than a character |
builder, and in the latter capacity
he lacks the personality, the human
touch, and the guiding hand to be
classed with such leaders as Alorizo
Stagg and the late Knute Rockne.
"Jones must change his system
or his plays or his technique. He
has material. He has speed, brains,
passing ability, line charging and
an equal amount of football genius
—on the bench—with that of any
other coach in the country.
"After what happened in the Mon
tana, College of Pacific and Illi
nois games, it is plain to even the
most loyal Jones followers" that he j
is not getting anything out of his
fine material. The system seems to |
have been overworked. Rival coach
es know more about it than Jones
himself."
"His teams are bogging down i
again just as they did at Yale', at
Ohio State, at lowa, at Duke.
"There is a new and shiny axe in
our secret closet. We hate to un
lock the door and take it out. But
if something does not happen to
the Southern California football I
team very soon we fear that the
lock on the door will fall off of its
own accord and the axe will come j
tumbling out raring for action."
The Trojan horse probably would
n't recognize the Paddock now.
