# Prospects Of 'Big Five' On Swim Squad Seen
## 
### 
Stanford's "big three" in swim
ming—Larry Pringle, Jack Vibert, '
and Harry Godman—seems destined
to become the "big five" if the pres- i
ent plans of Coach Nort Thornton
materialize.
Thornton has a fourth man, Alec
Mackenzie, who may shortly join the !
trio of local Weissmullers, and even
a fifth, Bill Lhamon, who shows
plenty of promise although he has
only been working out since last
Monday.
As a matter of fact, the Indian
swimming coach has been secretly
grooming his hopes since one day
last summer when Godman, with
Lhamon pressing him all the way,
won the Northern California 50-
meter title by hanging up a mark of
27.4 seconds. The scene of the racs
was Fleishhacker Pool in San Fran
cisco, which is faster than the En
cina pools under any conditions, in- I

asmuch as the swimmer need make
no turns at the 50-meter distance.
Then along came Vigert, junior
transfer from Pasadena J.C., to turn
the trick in 26.7 and eclipse the rec
ord by a full half-second. And
when Godman annihilated Keoloha's
record in practice with a time of
26.4, the Indians' prospects for in
tercollegiate competition began to
take on a rosy hue.
A.A.U. officials will bring their
official stop-watches to the Farm to
morrow and pull them out at 3:15
o clock, just before the water poio
tilt with the Olympic Club. At that
time Coach Thornton's "big three"
i.'i scheduled to make its bid for hon
ors in the world of sport. Admission
will be free and a public address
system will be used to make an
nouncements and give quarterly re
sults of both the Stanford-Washing
ton football tilt and the U.S.C.-Cali
fornia battle.
