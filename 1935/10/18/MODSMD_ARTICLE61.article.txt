# "Let the Winds of Freedom Blow"
## Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily Member of the Associated Press Only Get-Together Of Year for Women Is Offered Tonight 
### 
It's women's night on the Farm.
Out of the three hundred and sixty-live
nights during the year, this evening is the
one time set aside exclusively for the "eleven
hundred" for their annual Women's Con
ference party.
That party oilers practically the only op
portunity for all women of the campus, the
new and the old, to get together. On the
expanding Farm where there is ever an in
creasing number of living groups, the women
liml themselves no longer united as well as
before the inllux. A day or u night oil' is
found more necessary now than fifteen years
ago when the idea originated to permit the
women lo cast aside worries of studies and
dates and become acquainted with the cam
pus groups.
Such an opportunity is presented with the
Conference parly where the women may min
gle freely with the members of their other
living groups. The conference, sponsoring the
event, is made up of the presidents of all the
women's living groups, assisted by the ball
sponsors, and the board of the Women's Ath
letic Association.
To make the all'air more informal, cos
tumes are required with prizes given for the
best and funniest clothes. Mrs. Herbert Hoo
ver, Dean Mary Yost, and Mrs. Ann Holman
will act as judges. Skits, exhibitions, basket
ball games, and a ping pong tournament coin
prise the list of entertainment.
So members of Stanford's "eleven hundred"
will move on the women's gymnasium tonight
for their only opportunity of the year to know
better other members of the conference as a
body in the annual get-together, originated in
1920 lo create a greater unity and a friendlier
feeling among the women on the Farm.
