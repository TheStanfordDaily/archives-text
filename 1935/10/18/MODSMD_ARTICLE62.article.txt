# And Sudden Death; Stanford Not Immune
## 
### 
In his article " And Sudden Death," re
printed from the Headers' Digest in today's
Daily, .1. G. Furnas presents a morbidly real
istic view of the blood and gore resulting from
chance-taking on modern highways. The ar
ticle, which was first printed three months
ago, is already famous as a gem of descrip
tive writing.
However, the article is more than a grue
some literary epic; ils nauseating description
is taken from the personal stories of physi
cians and police, its figures and facts come
from the actualities of recent motor accidents.
Mr. Furnas wrote " -And Sudden Death"
with the express purpose of frightening the
reckless, non-thinking portion of America's
driving public into submission to law and
intelligent operation of the millions of cars
that crowd the nation's highway system.
The keynote of " And Sudden Death" hits
home, but il could be brought even closer,
for example, if Mr. Furnas should gather
part ol the material for a sequel to his original
masterpiece Irom llie Bayshore Highway or
from Lasuen Street in front of Stanford's
post office.
