\\ union should pay I heir own way on dales,
a "Vox Campi" assures us. Yet the average
Stanford man feels rather imeomfortahle in

a gigolo role when nn occasional rare femine
does untie her purse-strings. It is too uncon
ventional lo leave the male mind at ease.
It is in this matter of paying for dates that
the cquality-for-women banner drags in the
dust. Women are not equal lo men, or like
men. Cod he praised, it is unlikely that I hey
ever shall be. The male still shows his supe
riority in this one well-dclined manner—he
pays the bills.
Despite the llattery paid lo the male's lot
in society by the woman's light to share it,
the woman does not really yearn lo wear the
pants as much as superficial proponents
would have us think.
A Mellinkollian Bull Session of bygone days
is brought to mind. It read in part, "The
emancipation of women seems not to have
led to any carefully thought-out ideas . . .
lint rather lo a general willy-nilly attitude
about life in general."
The article pled for a return of the woman
from the bridge-table to the kitchen, and
thought "at least she should be as ready to
understand the needs of a child, as she is lo
pick up the latest wrinkle in contract . . ."
There are indications here and there that
many women secretly long for the returning
popularity and faddish - propriety of home
life, child-raising, and being a mother. Their
Ming at playing even-Steven in a man's world
has not been—to them or to the men—an
unqualified success.
The woman-in-pants cycle would reach its
ludicrous peak if the men gave up their last
uninvaded prerogative — that of paying the
bills.
