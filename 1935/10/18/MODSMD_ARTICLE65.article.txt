# Into the Jazz Field

With the Gaieties striving to get a national
hook-up to broadcast some of its hit songs,
there is a chance that Stanford may become
known as a home of budding composers, as
well as a haven for scholars and All-Ameri
cans.
Last year Princeton added to its national
prestige with "Love and a Dime." Two Stan
ford hits, of nearly the same caliber, "Major
in Love" and "The Elemental," withered and
died after last year's Gaieties for want of
sufficient publicity.
"So Lovely and So Sweet" put Dudley Nix's
name in the forefront last year. Possibly his
"Freshman Slide," slated for the Gaieties, will
do it again Ibis yearâ€”but this time Stanford's
name goes with his. Also, a year's more ex
perience may well put Mac Gordon, Pete
Knecht, and Win Weaver nearer the hit-writer
stage.
To those striving to put the Gaieties on the
air, Stanford can well afford to give her sup
port so thai Stanford prestige can branch out
into another field.
