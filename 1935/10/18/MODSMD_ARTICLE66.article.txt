## A 						STRIKE FOR WAR? 
### 
The white hope of the world is peace, but American
youth has a curious way of painting it Red. Last
spring, what started out as a sincere effort to impress
legislators with collegiate antipathy against war ended
at the University of California as a radical demonstra
tion. There Reds of choice joined with Reds of neces
sity not in crying down martial carnage, but in talking
up their own martyrdom, i

Today, (he National Youth Congress has announced
another strike against war, this one to take place on
Armistice Day, November 11. Will this demonstration
be sincere and worthy of sane student participation,
or will it, as the last one, end as a parade of mal
contented sign-carriers?
Confidential revelations of the operation of the
N.Y.C. gives an interesting insight into why collegiate
war strikes usually end as emotional and intellectual
binges.
Originally dominated by conservative and reason
ably liberal groups, including religious seminary stu
dents, the Congress had banged around the nation's
campi under indecisive direction. A few radical mem
bers, sensing their opportunity, high-pressured con
trol into their own hands, and immediately began using
the organization in the name of their collective beliefs.
In ihe face of the failure of the last strike to achieve
ils purpose, any organization which again sets about
"striking tips its mitt to those of us who look before
we act.
It is almost a dead certainty that ihe N.Y.C.s
demonstration will end not as a fight against war, bul
as a fight against the people and things Congress
leaders have singled out as their pet gripes.
This "buller" will eat his hat if striking soap-boxers
don't very gently, but firmly, wander from the pro
grammed denunciation of war to denunciation of
"capitalism,"' "Hearst," and the "emotional interpre
tation of history"—the tongue-worn cliches of any
radical meeting anywhere at anytime.
