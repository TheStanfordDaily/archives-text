"KIND LADY"
At (he Curran Theater
May Robson, playing the title role
in ''Kind Lady" at the Curran, does
an exceptionally fine bit of acting in
the typical Robson style.
The tale concerns an elderly lauy,
imprisoned in her own home by a
group of painting thieves. They
keep her in isolation while grad
ually selling her collection of can
vases and try to give outsiders the
impression that she is crazy in order
to cover up her efforts to seek help.

| The plot, although a bit fantastic,
is exciting. It is carried out by
j means of the flash-back method, in
which the prologue is in the present
1 and the main body of the play cx
| plains how the situation came about.
I Edward Chodorov adapted Hugh
i Walpole's story 'for stage use and
did an excellent* job of it.
Other characters were negligible.
' Ralph Forbes, of movie fame, is
| given very little opportunity but i:;
capable. No minor bits stood out.
However, the play's suspense is well
held up by every character, espe
cially in the hypnosis scene in the
third act.
On the whole, the play is well
worth a trip to San Francisco—May
Robson is superb, and that should be
jenough.
