# NOT AFTER EVERY LETTER
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Following your first letter in the
Vox Campi of Thurday, was an in- I
jane remark ("Those Naughty
Nazis") which most surely indicate-i
that your sense of humor is sadly
distorted, misplaced, and most un
reasonableâ€”in fact, we found no
humor there at all.
We disapprove of such adolescent
retorts which have followed some of
the letters in Vox Campi during the
entire quarter and which recall to us {
memories of our Paducah Union
High monthly sheet. . . .
M.A., W.H. i
