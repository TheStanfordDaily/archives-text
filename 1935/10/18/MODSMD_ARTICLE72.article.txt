# IT'S HE WHO PAYS

The Editor, Sir:
Inasmuch as the leap year of 193(5
is approaching, I think it is high
time that Stanford manhood unite
and do something about it.
For generations, we poor gullible
males have catered to the weaker
| (?) sex. We pay exorbitant rates to
sit in uncomfortable chairs sur

rounded by blood-sucking waiters
in the city's dens of robbery; we
pay double to see a show and listen
to a discussion of Clark Gable's
charms by the recipient of our
charity.
Women claim equal footing with
men in all walks of life, except the
putting out of dough. They claim
there is in reality only a little dif
ference between men and women.
While we thank God for the little
difference, we see no reason why we
males should bear the whole burden
in currency. Let's hear some sup
port through this column. Awake,
Roughs, your hour of glory is at
hand! W. R.
