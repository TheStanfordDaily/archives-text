Dramatics for the entire fall quar

Professor Lee Emerson Bassett an
nounced yesterday. Frank O'Neill,
slated to direct the November 1
production of "Dark Tower" dur
ing the absence of William Murray
Timmons, was named official play
head for the next three months.
Definite word from President Raj'
Lyman Wilbur was expected on the
Gaieties question. The pre - Big
Game celebration will probably be
turned over to Ram's Head Society,
Professor Bassett indicated. If any
faculty supervision is thought neces
it will be done by O'Neill.
"I consider O'Neill well qualified
for the position," commented Bas
sett. "He has directed campus read
ings with great success. I have sat
in on his rehearsals, helping him
choose casts, and have found him
highly capable."
O'Neill's position will be that of
a teaching assistant. Phil Brown,
also a student, will fill the post of
technical director for the same pe
riod.
Director Timmons, although he
may resume his classes, will not be
able to go on with play direction
fall quarter. It is not definitely set
tled, said Bassett, that he will return
at the beginning of winter quarter.
