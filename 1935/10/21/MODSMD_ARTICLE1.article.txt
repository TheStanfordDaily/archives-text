Saturday, Oct. 19 (Delayed) (A 3 ). —
Slight advances along the left and
right sectors strengthened the Ital
ian armies' front line today, laying
the groundwork for a new major at
tack expected possibly within 48
hours.
The Italian line on the northern
front now resembles a square
wedge, jutting from the middle of
the former Eritrean border.
Except for the activity of the
flanks, military operations at the
front were at a standstill.

Aerial reconnaissance, however,
continued along the 515-mile line
extending from the Sudanese border
to the vicinity of Harar.
Quiet also prevailed along the
Somaliland frontier, where rains
were holding up the Italian ad
vance.
Only a slight forward movement
along the frontier-of British Somali
land has taken place in the last few
days.
A major concentration of Ethi
opian warriors at Makale in a
desperate effort to thrust off the
next great Italian attack was re
ported by reconnaissance planes.
They said the forces of Ras Kassa,
assembling at Makale, had been
joined by a contingent of crack im
perial troops rushed northward by
Emperor Haile Selassie.
