# Siegfried Recalls His Views Of Presidents

### BARBARA SWEET 
In an informal talk to a group of
facully and students at Lagunita
Court Saturday evening, Andre
Siegfried, noted author, gave his
impressions of the presidents of the
United States whom he has known,
from Lincoln to Franklin D. Roose
velt.
Lincoln, Mr. Siegfried said, he
knew by proxy, his father's vivid
descriptions of Lincoln being so
clear that Mr. Siegfried could hardly
distinguish them from his own
memories.

"My father's first impression of
Mr. Lincoln was that of an enormous
pair of boots standing alone in the
middle of the room. Pretty soon
Lincoln came in, climbed into the
boots, and asked my father to ac
company him while he reviewed the
army, which my father did, dressed
in the uniform of an American naval
officer," Mr. Siegfried told his au
dience.
In 1901, Mr. Siegfried and his
father had the privilege of meeting
Grover Cleveland, who was then
president. The elder Mr. Siegfried
described to the president the above
incident.
"Why," said Mr. Cleveland, "you
must have passed me in review that

day. I was a captain in the army
then."
Tells of Wilson
President Wilson, Mr. Siegfried
met twice, once when Wilson was
head of Princeton University, and
once during his term of office in the
White House. Both times Mr. Sieg
fried received the same impression
of the man—that he was unap
proachable.
"He kept men at a distance," the
author said. "His contact was with
ideas, never with human beings. I
think this was his greatest weak
ness."
Theodore Roosevelt had a very
hearty manner with his visitors.
"Hello, boys! How are you, b'>ys?
Glad to see you, boys!" and the
visitor somehow found himself in
the street. President Coolidge, on
the other hand, was very reserved.
"I listened and Mr. Coolidge said
nothing," the Frenchman said.
"The difference between Amer
ica's and Europe's great men," Mr.
Siegfried concluded, "is the sim
plicity with which the American
celebrities meet the public. In Eu
rope you don't go up to a ruler, slap
him on the back, and say, 'Hello,
king!' as they do in America, al
though some of the American tour
ists have yet to learn thus."

army, which my father did, dressed
in the uniform of an American naval
officer," Mr. Siegfried told his au
dience.
In 1901, Mr. Siegfried and his
father had the privilege of meeting
Grover Cleveland, who was then
president. The elder Mr. Siegfried
described to the president the above
incident.
"Why," said Mr. Cleveland, "you
must have passed me in review that

day. I was a captain in the army
then."
Tells of Wilson
President Wilson, Mr. Siegfried
met twice, once when Wilson was
head of Princeton University, and
once during his term of office in the
White House. Both times Mr. Sieg
fried received the same impression
of the man—that he was unap
proachable.
"He kept men at a distance," the
author said. "His contact was with
ideas, never with human beings. I
think this was his greatest weak
ness."
Theodore Roosevelt had a very
hearty manner with his visitors.
"Hello, boys! How are you, b'>ys?
Glad to see you, boys!" and the
visitor somehow found himself in
the street. President Coolidge, on
the other hand, was very reserved.
"I listened and Mr. Coolidge said
nothing," the Frenchman said.
"The difference between Amer
ica's and Europe's great men," Mr.
Siegfried concluded, "is the sim
plicity with which the American
celebrities meet the public. In Eu
rope you don't go up to a ruler, slap
him on the back, and say, 'Hello,
king!' as they do in America, al
though some of the American tour
ists have yet to learn thus."
In an informal talk to a group of
facully and students at Lagunita
Court Saturday evening, Andre
Siegfried, noted author, gave his
impressions of the presidents of the
United States whom he has known,
from Lincoln to Franklin D. Roose
velt.
Lincoln, Mr. Siegfried said, he
knew by proxy, his father's vivid
descriptions of Lincoln being so
clear that Mr. Siegfried could hardly
distinguish them from his own
memories.
Remembers Impression
"My father's first impression of
Mr. Lincoln was that of an enormous
pair of boots standing alone in the
middle of the room. Pretty soon
Lincoln came in, climbed into the
boots, and asked my father to ac
company him while he reviewed the
army, which my father did, dressed
in the uniform of an American naval
officer," Mr. Siegfried told his au
dience.
