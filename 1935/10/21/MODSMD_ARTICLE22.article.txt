# Men In Shape For Full Grid Session Today
## Hamilton Favors Muscle; Grayson 'All Set' 
### 
For the first time since the
U.C.L.A. nightmare, Stanford's foot
ball team will work out en masse
this afternoon with exception only of
the two "out for the seasoners"â€”
Frankie Alustiza and Chet Olcott.
Bobby Grayson got his "leave"
slip from the hospital in time to
make the trip to Berkeley with
the rest of the team Saturday for
the California-Santa Clara game
and assuringly announced that he
was "all set for practice Monday,
despite a lame ankle.
Bones Hamilton was also expected
to' be in uniform today, according
to Tiny Thornhill, although still fa
voring his pulled leg muscle.
Monk Moscrip, his bashed shin
healed sufficiently to permit playing,
will likewise be back at work. And
Keith Topping with no more debate
worries also is slated to appear in
uniform.
After last Friday's fateful scrim
mage, when Grayson reinjured his
ankle, Thornhill has decided to send
his men through signal drill only
this week, running no more risk of
untimely scrimmage injuries.
