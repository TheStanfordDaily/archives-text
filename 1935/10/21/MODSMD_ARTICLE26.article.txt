# Cardinals Plan Victory Drive, Send-Off Rally
## 'Halt the Huskies' Theme Of Practice Session Next Monday Spirit Needed for Win Windshield Stickers Out By Noon Today 
### Gordon Frost 
Unless there is more enthusiasm,
more "victory spirit" behind Stan
ford's football team, the Indians
may easily lose to Washington at
Seattle next Saturday.
With this belief, the Stanford
Cardinals went into action yester
day afternoon, called a special
meeting, and drew plan* for a
four-day "Injun uprising" cam
paign to be climaxed with a scnd
oil rally at the train Thursday
cvening.
In the four intervening days of
campaigning Cardinals propose to
contact every living group to explain
the need of better student support to
a crippled, underdog football team.
Windshield stickers will be out by
noon today bearing the campaign
slogans, "It's Time for an Injun Up
rising. Halt those Huskies."
Wednesday afternoon will be
"Halt the Huskies" practice ses
sion, according to present plans.
Repeating the "Students' Day"
held two weeks ago, Farm fans
will be asked to attend football
practice, offer moral support, and
let an injury-ridden team know
that they go north with full Indian
hopes behind.
Thursday afternoon when the
team entrains, the Cardinals plan one
of the most elaborate send-off rallies
of recent years.
The whole move was brought
about primarily by the actions of
Washington's Huskies in the north
last Saturday. Showing unstoppable
power, they easily downed Wash
ington State, 12-0, and definitely es
tablished their intention to annihi
late Stanford's Indians Saturday.
As the underdog, Stanford will
have to play its best football, but
more than that, will have to show
a winning spirit that can over-ride
the northern cry "on to the Rose
Bowl."
Without a rooting section to offer
support, Stanford will have to rely
entirely upon the spirit shown on
the Farm before the team leaves.
That spirit will either carry them
over the big hump or send them
into the toughest game of the season
without support.
It was with that idea in mind that
the Cardinals last night sent up th"
first Indian war cryâ€”"Halt those
Huskies."
