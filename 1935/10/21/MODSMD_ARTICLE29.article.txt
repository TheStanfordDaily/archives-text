# Card Debaters Lose Clash To Convict Team
## Prisoners Judged Best Before Huge Crowd 
### 
Stanford bowed to San Quentin by
a score of 3 to 0.
Boboy Grayson, Keith Topping,
and Bob Gros composed the Cardi
nal team which opposed three of
the best convict speakers before the
huge prison audience. Thouch the
judges' decision was 3 to 0, the de
bate was scored on the basis of
points, and a slim margin gave the
victory to the inmates.
Stanford men upheld the af
firmative of the question: "Re
solved, that Congress should be
permitted by a two-thirds major
ity vote to over-ride any five-to
four decision of the Supreme
Court declaring a law unconstitu
tional."
The Stanford delegation was sat
isfied with the decision, and Debate
Coach Lee Chapin stated that both
Grayson and Topping did very well
for their first college debate. In
Chapin's opinion, Gros was the best
debater, Topping the best entertain
er, and Grayson the best promise for
developing into a first-class debater.
The visitors were well received
at the prison, and other than hav
ing their car searched and their
cameras removed at the gate, the
reception was hearty for the Stan
ford football players. The pris
oners have access to the sport
pages and radio broadcasts of the
games, and the Stanfordites found
the inmates ardent followers uf the
Big Red Machine.
Last week's defeat to the Bruins
cost several "sacks of weeds" to
those fans who bet on a Stanford

I victory over U.C.L.A., and Grayson
I and Topping were warned not to
| come around after losing another
! game.
The history of the Stanford-San
' Quentin debate stands now at four
j victories and two defeats for Stan
, ford. The team which lost pre
i viously was composed of Abe Mel
j linkoff, Bromley Smith, and Spencer
' Thompson.
