# Student Guide Plan Censured
## 
### 
Approval of student guides to be
placed in living groups was denied
by Graduate Manager A1 Masters,
according to an announcement he
made yesterday.
The guides, tentatively approved
by Ex Committee last week, would
include a framed list of campus
numbers surrounded by ads. The
sheet, would be published weekly
and 10 per cent of net profits from
sale of ads would go to the A.S.S.U.
under the proposed plan.
Masters said he refused to approve
the measure because merchants
who bought advertising space on
dividers were told no other adver
tising of that type would be per
mitted on the campus.
Bob Jones, Daily editor, protested
at committee meeting the guides, if
used, would cut into Daily adver
tising.
