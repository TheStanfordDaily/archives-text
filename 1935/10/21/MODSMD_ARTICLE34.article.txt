### 
From his humble cot in the Paly
Hospital, Sylvestre Joseph Drofnats,
ace sports predictor and lounge
wizard, showed the D;iily reporter
the "X" where his body had bounced.
"The boys thought the 'X' stood
for xylophone and pounded me till
they got an 'Eeee' fiat/' he said.
"Tell it to Pappas," said the Daily
reporter, who is a follower of the
S.C. team, as are the Stanford
freshmen.
"Well," said Drofnats, who has a
reputation to maintain, "they got me
this time. What day is it? What's the
score. Who's playing?"
"Joe Coghloose. And every time
they give the axe yell, the Cardinals
go Stark, staring mad. What was
your score this week, Mr. Drofnats?"
"Nice weather, wasn't it?"
"What was your score, Mr. Drof
nats?"
"Did I ever show you my opera
tion?"
"What was your score, Mr. Drof
nats?"
"Well, I picked the tie between San
Jose and COP" (cost of production
equals selling price).
"What was your score, Mr. Drof
nats?"
"Well, I predicted that Oregon
would beat Idaho by 14 points, and
they did."
"What was your score, Mr. Drof
nats?"
"Well."
! "What was your score, Mr. Drof
nats?"
"Class averages are pretty low all
i over."
| "What was your score, Mr. Drof
nats?"
"I stayed up all night with a bad
i stomach and a sour puss."
"What was your score, Mr. Drof
! Nats?"
"And she was, too, what I mean."
"What was your score, Mr. Drof
! Nats?"
"Well, as a matter of fact it was
50 per cent. Pretty good, don't you
think?"
