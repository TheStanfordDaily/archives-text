THE HIGH HURDLE
IS JUST AHEAD
Now for the big hump. Within
the next week Stanford will be
either "in'' or "out" and it all de
pends upon the outcome of that little
football skirmish with the Washing
ton Huskies in Seattle Saturday.
Those Huskies were powerful
last week-end, entirely too power
ful to please Stanford. They rolled
easily to a 21-11 triumph over
Washington State, in the "Big
Game" of the northwest, and after
the afternoon's activities were
over definitely established them
selves as "Rose howl bound."
They outcharged and outmaneu
vered the Cougars, gained almost
twice a.s many yards and just were
n't in the mood to be stopped at all.
On the first play of the game Half
back Byron Haines broke loose for
a 70-yard touchdown dash and from
that minute on they kept the game
well under control.
Last year the Huskies' passing at
tack, supposedly unstoppable, lost
them the football game and a pos
sible Rose Bowl bid to Stanford.
They came to the Farm to throw
passes over Bobby Grayson but
Bobby didn't approve of that idea
and proceeded to put himself in the
way ol several flying Husky heaves.
Interception lost the game for
Washington.
But on the ground they weren't
as outclassed as the 24-0 score
might indicate. Ami this year they
have better ground-power than
last and they won't throw the ball
game away passing to Stanford's
men.
Washington was headed for the
Rose Bowl when Stanford broke
their hopes last year. This time it's
the same situation. Only Stanford,
once beaten already, plays on for
eign soil and without Frankie Alus
tiza.
Naturally they're already laying
money on the Huskies and it's go
ing to take an inspired Indian team
playing top-notch ball to make
them lose. ,
And Stanford's team, far from in
spired so far this year, needs a lot
ol mental conditioning before Satur
day. It will take an enthusiastic
student body with some of the
U.C.L.A. spirit" of a week ago to
give them the punch that can pull
the underdog out in front.
