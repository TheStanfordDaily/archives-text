# Bears, Huskies Still Hold Lead
## 
### 
Joe Kellcy, Santa Clara right
guard, playing his first game at quar
terback, got oil" a now-historic fluke
kick against California, and so Cal
beat the Broncs, 6-0.
Back to punt's early in the second
quarter, Keliey booted the ball hard
as he knew how. But .he was sur
prised when the oval zinged over his
right shoulder and caromed 24 yards
— backwards, putting the Bears into
scoring territory.
A moment later Floyd Blower,
last week's hero, hooked a 40-yard
pass to Ilenry Sparks, who pulled
it down and scored.
With the exception of those two
plays, the Bear-Bronc affair was al
most exactly even. Both annexed
almost identical yardage and first
downs. Santa Clara had three or
four chances to tie or win the game,
but it was the same story of the
U.C.L.A.-Card affair—not quite the
punch or breaks.
California, the sole surviving
undefeated, untied, unscored-on
Western hall club, huddled on top
»>f the heap, now looks ahead to
three tough games in a row —
I'.S.C., U.C.L.A., and Washington.
Washington's driving Huskies also
survived by trimming W.S.C. 21-0.
Cougar Ed Goddard was stopped by
a charging Husky line, and Univer
sity's Haines, Logg, and Cain were
able to tally three limes.
The orange grove weather did not
"get" Oregon State's gridders as was
expected, and the Beavers did a
little "getting" of their own to top
Troy, 13-7.
Stanford, U.C.L.A., and St. Mary'j
11 rested over the week-end, but all
go into action next week, meeting
Washington, Oregon, and U.S.F., re
spectively.
