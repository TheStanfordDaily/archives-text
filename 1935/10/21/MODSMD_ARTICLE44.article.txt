A close game, a walkaway, and a

default comprised the results of Fri
day's mural football games. Three of
today's four games were originally
scheduled for last Monday, but
were postponed because of rain.
Eric ("the Red") Sorensons pass
to Earney Smith brought the Alpha
Delts their narrow victory over the
Medical School. The game was fea
tured by good blocking by both
sides.
Phi Delta Phi whipped El Cuadro,
31 to 6, almost entirely on Rod Bost's
passes. The diminutive, former var
sity basketball star tossed two touch
down passes to John Gallagher and
one each to Tom Moroney and Carl
Abbott. John Hancock made the

! fifth score for the lawyers on a pass
from Moroney. Raymond scored for
El Cuadro.
The Firehouse forfeited to Sequoia
I in the fourth game scheduled for
yesterday.
