# On to Seattle — Halt the Huskies
## Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily The
						Fight /or the Hose Bowl Is On Chances for Dispelling 'Gloom' on Farm Offered in Crucial Game on Saturday 
### 
Blase, "unbeatable" Stanford, llabby with
three big years on the gridiron, iliis week
awakens to find her football team rated an
underdog, a position unknown to Farm stu
dents of the current prosperity era.
Two weeks ago the Indians faltered. The
Associated Students, trained to believe in the
omnipotence of the "best team in the coun
try," didn't quite know how to take it. The
majority of comment indicates they have
taken it lying down, that they believe the Hose
Bowl bid is "all washed up," that Stanford's
football days are over.
Notwithstanding this, however, their train
ing to expect victory has become so lirmly
rooted in their minds that they still sub
consciously cannot feature Stanford being
beaten again this year. This gives rise to a
decidedly peculiar and unhealthy situation—
student moaning says Stanford is washed up;
yet Indian backers continue unconcernedly in
their daze, clinging to the rationalization that
Stanford's football machine is superhuman,
not susceptible to error and occasional defeat,
experienced by every other team in the coun
try.
Yet the Indians, crippled physically, some
what disgusted mentally, are going through
their final preparations for a game with Wash
ington's Huskies, favored to beat them, in the
crucial contest of Stanford's entire schedule.
Hut still the student body continues with
the. mistaken impression that "of course

Washington couldn't beat the best team in the
country."
If Stanford wins Saturday, she will be one
of three teams still in the race for the Hose
Howl; she will have regained her former posi
tion as "the team to beat"; her attitude will
be up where it was when she swept through
U.S.C. in 1933, but sharpened a bit by the sling
of the U.C.L.A. defeat.
If Stanford loses, the Hose Bowl will have
passed beyond all reclamation; the team and
student altitude may slip to a fatal level; Cali
fornia and downtrodden "old S.C." will perk
up to new possibilities of the current football
season.
Washington is powerful—not as good as the
Stanford team that was rated over all coiners
on September lf>, but better than the Indian
eleven that defeated San .lose Stale and U.S.F.
and was not quite so fortunate against West
wood's Bruins.
This week provides the test of Stanford
spirit. The Stanford Cardinals today begin a
four-day rally that will be climaxed by a mass
send-oll' Thursday afternoon when the team
leaves for Seattle.
It was a "spirit that won't be beaten" that
started Stanford up the ladder two years ago;
il was this same spirit, voiced by U.C.L.A.,
that temporarily checked the climb last week.
Now a revival of that we-won't-bc-bcaten at
titude is necessary to put Stanford back on the
prosperity wagon—otherwise the toboggan
ride seems inevitable.
