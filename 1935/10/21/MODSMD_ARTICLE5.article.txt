# Helena Rocked By Recurrent Earth Shocks
## Damage from 248 Quakes Placed at $1,500,000

HELENA, Mont., Oct. 20 (/P). —
Continuing earth shocks made Hel
ena a virtually deserted city today.
The earth quivered intermittently
for two hours during the early
morning, keeping the torn, terrified
city on edge but the shocks were not
of sufficient force to add to the losses
previously inflicted — two dead,
scores injured, and property dam
age estimated at $1,500,000.
The damage figure was a con
sensus of many estimates, one pre
liminary survey of the city engi
neer ranging as high as $2,500,000.
The records of the Helena Weather
Bureau reflected a grand total of
248 earth shocks, major and minor,
since October 12.
Authorities still deferred invoking
martial law, but an emergency
ordinance was being drafted for
adoption by the city council to
morrow to facilitate the abandon
ment or destruction of buildings
found unsafe.
While outwardly many larger
buildings on Main street in the heart
of Last Chance Gulch escaped un
manned, inward structural defects
were feared in some.
Authorities directed that the mag
nificent St. Helena's Cathedral not
be occupied temporarily after the
towering south spire was found
severely damaged near the belfry.
The early morning quivers were
of the jarring variety rather than
the rolling, shaking type of previous
shocks.
