# Colleges Line Up On Olympic Boycott Issue
## 
### 
While anti-Nazi members of the Amateur
Athletic Union are preparing for a battle that
"will shake the Union to ils foundations"
regarding an American boycott of the 1930
Olympic Games at its-national convention
December 0, the nation's college students are
lining themselves on one side or the other of
the question of U.S. participation.
Since the Metropolitan A.A.U. district, big
gest single unit of the Union, voted against the
boycott, anti-Hitler chances of putting the res
olution through apparently have diminished
to a point where they have little hope of
success.
In nil probability, consequently, the battle
-will terminate in a resolution favoring partici
pation. When and il this resolution is passed,
the true spirit of sportsmanship and amateur
athletics, clearly voiced by the Olympics, will
have surmounted ils last official barrier.
One danger will remain, however â€” the
chance of a few scattered individual boycotts,
sponsored by die-hard groups, which would
lower the class of the American Olympic
team. Individual action has already been voted
by Columbia University's student board,
which recently resolved to oppose participa
tion of Columbia men in the 1930 (lames.
American participation at Her lin is left in
the hands of the National A.A.U. There seems
to be little doubt that the Union will approve
the Games, in which case il would be foolish,
detrimental stubbornness for a few colleges
to continue with their individual boycotts.
If the United States enters the Olympics,
as she seems sure to do, anti-Nazi feeling could
be best served by a representative American
team that would administer a beating, in a
sportsmanlike way, to Hitler's own German
athletes.
