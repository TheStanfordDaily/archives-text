Gather round the fire, kiddies, and papa will tell
you a few brief tales about the world's most famous
Hasher and Stanford's most distinguished son (next
to Lawson Little):
Campus correspondents, greatly harrassed by the
burden of filling San Francisco newsorgies with scan
dal about college youth, thought up a new one last
week. They concocted a wild tale of four students being
given a lift without camels by former President Her
bert Hoover in his Buick touring car. The story read
at great length about the democratic manner of the
defender of San Juan Hill.
It was a well written story, except for the fact that
Mr. Hoover has no Buick touring car, and the fact that
at that trme he was not on the campus, but back in
New York City, Stanford Associating with Associates.
Full ability of the Head Hasher to take a joke on
himself is proven by the story recounted in Time sev
eral weeks ago. A member of the Bohemian Club,
Mr. Hoover was attending the convivial rites of that
convivial club in the Grove. Time reports that the
ex-president took it good-naturedly when a tipsy
tippler accosted him with: "Did anyone ever tell you
how much you look like that Hoover?"
One of the stories that Mr. Hoover tells on him
self concerns that nemesis of foot-heavy and fancy
free California motorists: the small-town speed cop.
At a late hour one night a year or so ago, he was
returning from a meeting in Southern California. Mr.
Hoover drove his car through the deserted streets of
the rodeo and hamburger stand center of the Pacific
Coast at a rate certainly insulting to traffic conditions
in the rodeo metropolis.
There were three people awake in the cow town that
night: Mr. Hoover, his companion, and a speed cop.
All of a sudden there came the tintinnabullation of the
bells, silver bells. Mr. Hoover pulled over to the curb.
The cop accosted the driver: "Where's your driver's
license?" Mr. Hoover produced. The cop studied it a
moment. "Are you the Ruy?" he asked. "Yes," said
Mr. Hoover. "Well, buddy," he remarked, "if you get
any pleasure out of it, go to it."
