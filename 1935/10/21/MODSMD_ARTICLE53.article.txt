## THE 						FATE OF DAVID LAMSON 
### 
In just a week ... a Stanford man . . . almost
completely deserted for a year and a half by the
University as he wages a fight for his life . . . faces
a third trial for a crime which impartial observers
believe was never committed . . . with circumstances
pointing to but a dim hope of immediate acquittal.
* * * j|;
David Lamson, the man who is called by many a
wife-killer, goes on trial in Satr Jose next Monday,
the victim of one of the most unsubstantial cases of
criminal prosecution in the history of the state. In his
first trial he was found guilty, but so flimsy was the
evidence used to bring about his conviction that the
supreme court ruled a mistrial. The second trial, which
to many court observers, including a majority of the
newspapermen covering the case, proved innocence
conclusively, ended when the jury could come to no
decision.
* * * *
Now, in spite of the fact that a man who has not
been proven guilty has spent over a year in prison,
in spite of a lack of anything but trivial circumstantial
evidence on the part of the prosecution, in spite of
the thousands of dollars in costs to Santa Clara County,
and in spite of the improbability that a man or woman
eligible for jury duty in this district can be found
who does not have some opinion on the case, a third
trial is to be held.
* * * *
Stanford has all but forgotten David Lamson—yes,
but there are a few who so sincerely believe that the
case is a flagrant violation of justice to human free
dom, that they have all but made themselves soldiers
of a cause. One of these few is Arthur Yvor Winters,
instructor in English. Mr. Winters has written articles
in behalf of David Lamson, spoken frankly and sin
cerely from the public platform, and been one of the
leaders in gathering and interpreting the evidence of
the case so that those of open mind may know those
things which the press has been unwilling to print.
* # # >H
Yvor Winters and others took up the cause of David
Lamson before they had ever seen the accused man or
had become acquainted with his family. This they did
because they saw in the conviction of Mr. Lamson a
fate that might befall any citizen. A sudden accident
such as a slip in the bathtub, death, a possibility of
crime, then a prosecution going to the full limit of
their powers on the premise that the state must do
their utmost to prove the defendant guilty.
* * * *
David Lamson is likely to be convicted in this third
trial. Where evidence is not against him, the odds of
powerful pressure groups are. But if such does hap
pen, an appeal will ensue. And the evidence, without
the army of lawyers and witnesses will go to the
supreme court where the kind of justice that was hoped
for in the San Jose court may be obtained for the man
who has lived in hope behind prison bars for fifteen
weary months. —John McClelland

Now, in spite of the fact that a man who has not
been proven guilty has spent over a year in prison,
in spite of a lack of anything but trivial circumstantial
evidence on the part of the prosecution, in spite of
the thousands of dollars in costs to Santa Clara County,
and in spite of the improbability that a man or woman
eligible for jury duty in this district can be found
who does not have some opinion on the case, a third
trial is to be held.
* * * *
Stanford has all but forgotten David Lamson—yes,
but there are a few who so sincerely believe that the
case is a flagrant violation of justice to human free
dom, that they have all but made themselves soldiers
of a cause. One of these few is Arthur Yvor Winters,
instructor in English. Mr. Winters has written articles
in behalf of David Lamson, spoken frankly and sin
cerely from the public platform, and been one of the
leaders in gathering and interpreting the evidence of
the case so that those of open mind may know those
things which the press has been unwilling to print.
* # # >H
Yvor Winters and others took up the cause of David
Lamson before they had ever seen the accused man or
had become acquainted with his family. This they did
because they saw in the conviction of Mr. Lamson a
fate that might befall any citizen. A sudden accident
such as a slip in the bathtub, death, a possibility of
crime, then a prosecution going to the full limit of
their powers on the premise that the state must do
their utmost to prove the defendant guilty.

David Lamson is likely to be convicted in this third
trial. Where evidence is not against him, the odds of
powerful pressure groups are. But if such does hap
pen, an appeal will ensue. And the evidence, without
the army of lawyers and witnesses will go to the
supreme court where the kind of justice that was hoped
for in the San Jose court may be obtained for the man
who has lived in hope behind prison bars for fifteen
weary months. —John McClelland
In just a week ... a Stanford man . . . almost
completely deserted for a year and a half by the
University as he wages a fight for his life . . . faces
a third trial for a crime which impartial observers
believe was never committed . . . with circumstances
pointing to but a dim hope of immediate acquittal.

David Lamson, the man who is called by many a
wife-killer, goes on trial in Satr Jose next Monday,
the victim of one of the most unsubstantial cases of
criminal prosecution in the history of the state. In his
first trial he was found guilty, but so flimsy was the
evidence used to bring about his conviction that the
supreme court ruled a mistrial. The second trial, which
to many court observers, including a majority of the
newspapermen covering the case, proved innocence
conclusively, ended when the jury could come to no
decision.
