# INITIALS AFTER LETTERS
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Last Friday a remarkably odd
letter-to-the-editor appeared in the
[Vox Campi. Among other startling
things the author, a Mr. W. R., ex
pressed his gratitude to God for the
ratio of difference between men and
women.
Since the initials of the author,
: W.R., are the property of several
| students, undoubtedly several un
fortunate individuals, as I, were er
roneously credited as being the
j author of the letter.
Inasmuch as it is not a square
| policy to conceal one's identity, the
| Daily, out of consideration for the
; student body, should demand full
: signatures with all letters appearing
| in the Vox Campi.

Good point.—Ed.
