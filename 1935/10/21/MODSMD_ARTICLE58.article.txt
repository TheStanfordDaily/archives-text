# FIGHTING FOR PEACE
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
"Bull Session," formerly the
Daily's best feature, seems to have
: slid far and fast under this year's
wi iters. Ten days ago McClelland
1 told about Charles A. Beard's "sub
-1 versive" books, inferred that we
| should make a nice little Nazi bon-
I fire of them and some others. But
| intelligence, honesty, and liberalism
hit an all-time low in Eisenbach's
| column today.
He seems to be writing under the
influences of the "emotional inter
pretation." Firstly, it isn't the "Na
tional" but the "American Youth
Congress." Secondly, it isn't domi
nated by reds; cf. the recent Detroit
congress. The congress is now a
broader united front than formerly.
"Seminary students," liberal groups,
! Y.W. and Y.M.CA.'s are still back
ing it. Eisenbach's revelations about
reds pan out as just plain "bull."
Even farther off is Mr. Eisenbach
on the April 12 war strike. Some
measure of success may be seen in
that 150,000 students struck this year,
as against 25,000 last year. Last
spring a Washington Merry-Go-
Round squib said, "War officials are
worried by the success of the April
12th anti-war strike, and are pre
paring a new barrage of prepared
ness propaganda to counteract it."
Eisenbach shows all the signs of
an "emotional and intellectual
I binge" in writing this anti-peace ti
rade. He refers to the Berkeley
j strike as "radical"; in fact, over 4,000
students struck for peace.
"Bull Sessioner," hysterically at

tacking war's opponents, supports all
the world's war-mongers. His fool
| ish and malicious fulminations
{ against various minority groups
j show that he is not much opposed to
| Fascism.
