# "THE TRIAL OF MARY DUGAN"
## 
### 
At the Palo Alto Community Theater
One of the beauties of the Com-
I munity Theater productions lies in
the fact that the audience does not ,
I suffer through each line with the
j actors, as is often the case with
j amateur performances. * "Mary 1
Dugan" was no exception to the
rule and the fine cast of Palo Alto
and Stanford players put on as
smooth a performance as a profes- !
sional company could have, making j
an old play interesting by the eager
| freshness of their acting.
It is difficult to mention names
when the performances were con
sistently good, but Ernest A. Dunbar,
i as the district attorney, was espe- j
I cially fine, as was Atha Hillback as
Mrs. Edgar Rice. Joe Lawry M as
Jimmy Dugan deserves mention,
and Margaret Cochrane in the part ;

'of Mary Dugan, though she had
' little to do but look pained, did that
very nicely and made the most of
her lines on the witness stand.
