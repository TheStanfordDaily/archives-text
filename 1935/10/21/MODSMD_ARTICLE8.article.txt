# Camera Addicts Break Sunday Calm on Quad
## 
### IRVIN JORGENSEN 
Stciim creeping up out of the
mushroom-shaped ventilators that
dot the campus from the power
house to Roble showed that it was
a cool morning. Not a student clat
tered down the gloomy arcades, but
the mid-west sight-seers were al
ready out ogling at the Romanesque
and Franciscan architecture — Sun
day morning on the Quad.
In the harmony-wracked music
building, the choir was rehearsing
anthems for the morning service.
Fanatics Stalk Columns
Nearby was a group of camera
fanatics, stealthily stalking columns,
arches, facades, and landscapes with
their exposure meters.
"Yes," said a Mr. P. Douglas An
derson, "we often bring our camera
classes down here to Stanford. The
Quad architecture offers an excep
tional opportunity." Mr. Anderson is
a photographer, lecturer, and editor.

The class was from the U.C. exten
sion division.
"We will probably be down again
next Sunday," said the photogra
pher, lecturer, and editor as he
peered through his Contax camera.
"We're stopping it down to F. 3.5,"
he explained to the motley fanatics.
Distorted Visages
A tiny moppet swung a $200 cam
era around his head and chortled
with glee, but no other enthusiasm
was evinced by the group, who were
distorting their visages peering
through their finders.
The reporter elbowed his way past
other sightseers, who were plying
student guides with questions all
the while gazing at the Moorish and
the Romanesque.
Down in the fields a meadow-lark
teetered on his chilly perch. An En
cina freshman turned over in his lx-d
and cursed.
