# Spirit Rallies As Pep Drive Boosts Team
## Will Meet Living Groups Today To Push 'Wax Washington' Zeal Plan Students' Day Send-off Slated Thursday As Team Entrains 
### 
Picked men and women will can
vass all campus living groups this
noon in the first of a series of driv
ing moves to send Tiny Thornhill
and his men on to Seattle with one
purpose in mind: to Wax Washing
ton.
All fraternities, sororities, and
dormitory dining rooms will be
contacted to explain the serious
ness and necessity of good Stan
ford backing before the team de
parts Thursday.
Wednesday afternoon will be the
first chance for students to start
rooting. It will be students' day out
on the practice field, and Tiny
Thornhill promises an eyeful of
spirited footballing.
Then Thursday afternoon as the
Big Red Machine rolls off on its
non-stop Washington win, Rally
Committee tycoon Phil Coghlan
and Yell Leader Dick Stark arc
planning a rally at the Palo Alto
station that is to reach tremen
dous proportions.
A number of pep talkers are billed
to appear and a'few words by Coach
Tiny Thornhill, Bobby Grayson, and
Bones Hamilton are slated for sure.
But if Coghlan and Stark are siz
ing things up correctly, the team
and students will be in such a frame
of mind Thursday that when the
final gun sounds at Washington
Stanford will have "Halted the Hus
kies."
Already circulating about the
campus are red and white stickers
shouting "Wax Washington," and
"Halt the Huskies." More will be
passed this noon.
As well as desiring to win the
game Saturday and go on to fur
ther hcighths, the team is itching
to bring home the Husky pelt to
revenge its last loss in 1933, when
Sulkosky, Muczyinski, and Bill
Smith triumphed in the mud, 6-0.
But organization on the campus
in the next three days is going to
make sure that 1933 will not be re
peated. Just as fighting spirit and
"will-to-win" was the stuff that in
spired U.C.L.A. ten days ago, so
plentiful helpings of the old moxie
are going to inspire the Cards to go
off and wilt Washington.
