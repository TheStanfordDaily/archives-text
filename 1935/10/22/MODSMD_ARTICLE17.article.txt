"I built every Y.M.C.A., every
church. I asked Congress for the
j tnoney. They were glad to give it
• to me. I invented electricity when I
' was .six years old. Edison? Oh, I'm
! older than Edison." It was a kindly,
j middle-aged man who modestly
i confessed to his importance.
"I was created by God as the
I nameless man," explained a boy of
18.
A woman of 55 admitted, "I talked
too much. The devil made me talk
as a punishment."
These people and 36,000 like them
;»re patients in the Stockton State
Hospital. With complete lack of
self-consciousness they expressed
themselves before some 120 students
of abnormal psychology at the hospi

How far is the normal person from

insanity? The Stockton clinical di
rector explained to the class that
there is a very small dividing line
between normality ana insanity.
"Any person may be mentally ill
tomorrow."
It was further explained that in
sanity is merely an accentuation of
some personality trait. No mentally
ill person shows a characteristic
which is not latent, potential, or ac
tually present to a lesser degree in
every normal person.
'The world today is gradually
adopting a more sensible attitude
toward the insane — realizing that
these people should be treated like
any physically ill person. There is,
however, still a tendency fnrt" the ig
norant layman to attach the stigma
of disgrace to the insane," thi> clin
ical director explained.
