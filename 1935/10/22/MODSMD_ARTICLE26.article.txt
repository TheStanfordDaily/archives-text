# Espinosa Tells Of Three Chief Folklore Types
## Folktales Called Popular By Spanish Head In Radio Lecture 
### 
"Folklore means popular knowl
edge, what the ignorant people know
from tradition, handed down from !
generation to generation. It is never
technical knowledge although often i
based on human experience," said
Dr. Aurelio Espinosa in a radio talk
on "The Origin of Folktales" last
night.
Folklore is technically divided
into three forms, one of which is
the narrative dealing with an in
terpretation of nature, called a
totemic myth or tale; the second is
a story of an historical person,
such as King Arthur, which is
called a legend; and the third is
the traditional folktale dealing
with ordinary human beings.
Tho folktale is the most popular
and therefore the best known form
of folklore, and it is upon this form
that all the science of folklore is
based. However, the earliest known
narratives of a primitive people were
myths and totemic tales.
The first extensive collection of
folktales was made by the Grimm
brothers in 1812, and begins the
history of the folktale in Europe.
At first it was believed that there
was no folklore outside of Ger
many but later it was discovered
that similar folktales were to be
found all over the Occident.
More than half of the folktales of
Europe have Oriental sources or are
definitely of Oriental origin, al
though the manners and dates of
transmission are as yet not defi
nitely known, tl is also certain that
many came later through the
Greeks, Romans, Jews, Spanish
Saracens, and others.
