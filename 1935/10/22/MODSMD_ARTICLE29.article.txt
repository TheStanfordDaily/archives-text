# English Club Outlines Plan for Student Film
## 
### 
Making plans to present a student
produced movie, agreeing to buy and
give to the library all the books
published by its members, and dis
cussing the IMS yearbook, the Eng
lish Club met Sunday at the home
of Dr. Margery Bailey.
Two years ago Robert Louis Stev
enson's "Markheim" was filmed and
enacted by members of the club, but
there has been no showing of the
play. The club hopes to present the
picture and perhaps to film "The
House of Usher" this year.
As a first step toward collecting
the published works of its members, (

the English Club has bought "Seven
Peas in a Pod" and "Little Man with
One Shoe" by Margery Bailey;
"Light Ship," by Archie Binns;
"Tortilla Flat," by John Steinbeck;
"We Who Arc about, to Die," by
David Lamson; and "The Journey
and Other Poems," by Eva Winters.
It was announced at the meeting
lhat O'Brien's collection of short
stories this year gave honorable
mention to nine of 14 stories printed
last year in the yearbook. Among
those mentioned were John Tolman,
Albert Guerard, Eleanor Carlson,
North Baker, Barbara Gibbs, utid
Bob Grantier.
