# Theater Rights To Be Set By Ex Committee
## National Student Group Asks for Armistice Day Assembly Will Discuss Bonfire Washington, S.C. Want Brooke as Speaker 
### 
Will the campus see a ground
breaking ceremony within the next
few weeks for the long-awaited
theater?
Or will the program be postponed
until early February, after steam
shovels have done their work and a
skeleton of steel has risen on the site
of the old library?
Ex Committee is scheduled to
decide tonight which date will be
set According to Comptroller Al
lium E. Roth, who favors a corner
stone laying at the later date,
steam shovel excavation will prob
ably begin within two weeks. This
would rush preparation of a suit
able ceremony, if Ex Committee
chooses to set it at the date of
ground-breaking.
International Committee, set up by
President Wally Brooke at the first
fall meeting, wants to sponsor an
Armistice Day buffet supper in the
Women's Clubhouse. Over 250 are
expected to attend. Ex Committee is
involved because the Committee
may require financial backing for
the venture.
Federation Asks Assembly
National Student Federation is
calling for approval of an Armistice
Day assembly with student speak
ers. Ex Committee may prefer a
more non-committal discussion
group to a directly pacifist assembly.
The perennial bonfire question
will be threshed out again tonight.
If the project is okayed again this
year, a definite budget must be set
and tentatively drawn up plans
approved.
Marvie Kahn and Ben Cave will
appear with recommendations for
future Dividex supervisors. There
should be changes made, say the
two; and they plan to outline the al
tered system for approval of tho
executive body.
Brooke plans to call for a definite
policy on the use of the public ad
dress system â€”present lending is too
hit-or-miss, he says.
Ex Committee's modesty will be
put to a test when Brooke calls
for a decision as to what Quad
space the group will buy. Mem
bers previously were reluctant to
appear for an assembly. But is a
picture in the Quad the same
thing? Probably not, thinks Man
ager Chuck Fontius.
Both the University of Washing
: ton and U.S.C. want Brooko as a
pre-game speaker. If Ex Committee
sanctions expenses for the trips, ho
will leave Thursday for Washington,
where the Seattle rally will bo
broadcast on a coast-wide hook-up.
The Washington student body presi
dent will return the courtesy by an
' appearance here.
National Student Federation will
make a second appearance, by out
! lining and orchestra service. Ex
Committee will hear details of a
system enabling colleges wanting to
contact big-name orchestras to se
cure them through a central booking
bureau.
