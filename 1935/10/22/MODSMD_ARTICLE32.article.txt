## 
### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 21 (£>).—The
vociferous verbal battle over Amer
ica's entry in the 1936 O'ympic
Games at Berlin, centered mainly
about the issue of Germany's do
mestic treatment of Jewish athletes,
developed a rebuttal today from two
official sources to the latest attack
on Nazi policies by Jeremiah T. Ma
honey, New York, president of the
Amateur Athletic Union of the
United States.
In Berlin Dr. Theodore Lewald,
president of the German Olympic
Committee, declared :
"Olympic pledges given by the
German government and German
members of the International
Olympic Committee at Vienna,
Athens and Oslo absolutely will
be kept. There is no question of
religion in German sport. In the
course of preparations for the
Olympics, nobody has ever been
asked about his religion and there
has never been even one case
where anybody had any kind of
trouble because of his religion."
Mahoney, in a lengthy summary
of the "case against Germany" as
spokesman for the American ath
letic forces seeking either to take
the Olympics from Berlin or keep
this country from participating in
the games next year, had challenged
the accuracy as well as the authority
of Dr. Lewald's statements. The
chief executive of the American
A.A.U. insisted indisputable proof
existed of Germany's discrimination
against Jewish, as well as Catholic
athletes, and called upon Dr. Le
wald to resign his Olympic office.
