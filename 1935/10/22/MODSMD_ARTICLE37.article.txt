# Italians Begin Forceful Move
## 
### 
ADDIS ABABA, Oct. 21 (/P). —A
slow but forceful movement of the
Italian armies into the interior of
Ethiopia was seen by Ethiopians to
night as Premier Mussolini's pian of
campaign.
It was believed also that Mus
solini may attempt to begin direct
peace negotiations through Ital
ian Minister Count Luigi Vinci
gigliucci, who still remained in
Addis Ababa after being given his
passports and told to leave.
Observers saw the absence of ac
tion on the fronts as indicating the
Italians plan to move forward grad
ually, strengthening each position
taken, protecting the rear and
building roads behind them. An air
bombing near the Setit River by
Italians who apparently expected to
break up what they believed was a
concentration of Ethiopians was the
only war incident reported by the
government.
The recent blinding of 300 Italian
soldiers building a road from Mount
Mussa Ali to the Ethiopian frontier
on the central front, when they at
tempted to cut down the deadly Du
phobia cactus, was reported.
Adhering to the precedent of
previous emperors. Emperor Se
lassie has decided to have in his
company when he goes to battle
a dummy official who will be al
most his double.
