ABOARD THE U.S.S. HOUSTON,
En Route to Charleston, S.C., Oct.
21 (rP). —President Roosevelt, trailed
by a tropical hurricane, cancelled
his fishing plans in the Bahamas to
day and the cruisers Houston and
Portland sped through seas
direct toward Charleston, S.C.
Pounding waves encountered
while cruising through the Ba
hamas group kept the cruisers'
I speed to 17 knots which, officers
believed, would be sufficient to
keep the vessels ahead of the
i storm which is following the presi
' dential course through the Wind
| ward passage.
This speed will be maintained un
■| til the president is carried clear of
| the storm area. After that, a lei
surely pace will be adopted to bring
j the cruisers into Charleston early
I Wednesday morning.
Mr. Roosevelt, who had hoped for
! one more afternoon of fishing in
j southern waters, abandoned plans
; to stop at one of the islands after
' receiving weather reports from the
Jacksonville, Fla., bureau.
As early as yesterday afternoon
| the cruisers had encountered
heavy seas, brisk winds, and sud
den squalls.
After a tour of Charleston, the
j president \vill board a special train
for Washington, expecting to reach
; the White House Thursday.
