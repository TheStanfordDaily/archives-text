# Bobby Grayson Returns to Practice
## Indians Show Fire As 'Serious Seniors' Drive For Huskies Moscrip, Hamilton, and Adams Back at Posts 
### Bob Leland 
The "laughmg sophomores" be
came overnight the "serious seniors"
as they ran through signal drill yes
terday in preparation for the Wash
ington game.
Friday night's "bandage brigade"
was out in full force, and what
was thought to be the remnants of a
badly crushed squad has turned out
to be the fightingest bunch that has
worn the Stanford Red in many
years.
Bobby in Shape
Bobby Grayson, supposed to be
out of the Husky contest, was out
and around in fairly good shape.
Bones Hamilton was also out to
practice, and though favoring his bad
leg, looked good for Saturday.
Keith Topping and Monk Moscrip
were there and messing right into
the middle of things. Woody Adams
ran at left guard on the first team,
so that Frank Alustiza is now the
only regular missing.
Alternating in a backfieid that
contained four men but no positions
were Grayson, Hamilton, Paulman,
Coffis, and Vigna. The new forma
tions had Vigna, normally a right
half, running from what is usually
the left wing back. Hamilton worked
at his old position of right half, and
a likely starting combination Sat
urday might include Grayson, Ham
ilton, Coffis, and Paulman. If Bones
is not himself by game time, then
Vigna will probably pair with Coffis.
Use Single Wing
A single wing back formation with
Coflis and Hamilton or Vigna in the
tail-back position will be used
against the Huskies if the field is
wet. Power plays, from both double
and single wing-back formations
with all available interference in
front of the ball carrier will be
much in evidence.
With the Indian line clicking in
anything like the way it clicked last
season and the season before, Wash
ington will run into a lot of trouble
trying to stop those power shots with
Grayson or W'lJiams, his substitute,
shooting full speed ahead.
Memory of the mud battle of '33
and other similar tragedies of the
past, when the famous spinners and
reverses were rendered useless on
the slippery turf, is very clear in
Tiny Thornhill's mind as he pre
pares his charges for this all-im
portant battle. Take it for granted
â€”nothing will be overlooked!
Reserves Ready
The matter of reserve strength, a
topic that caused Stanford support
ers to shudder last week, can now be
discussed with hardly a tremor. Carl
Schott and Alex Trompas are fit and
ready to back up Moscrip and Top
ping at the ends.
Harry Carlson, Pop Grant, and
Neils Larsen stand behind Bob
Reynolds and Dale Beedle at the
tackles, while Bob Black, Dave Cu
neo, and Ralph Quails can be used to
replace Adams and Rouble if neces
sary. Alf Brandin is still ready to
step into the center spot.
Backfieid talent Is plentiful with
Fred Williams, Johnny Reisner, Tom
Collins, Doc Luckett, Leo Madlem,
Johnny Campbell, Earl Hoos, and
Glenn Hamilton ready to go.
A lot may depend on the trusty
right leg of Moscrip. If th<* going
gets tough around the opposition 20-
yard line, a field goal would help a
great deal. Monk spent quite a bit
of time booting placements from 10
and 20-yard lines, and in spite of
his injured shin, he booted several
through from the longer distance.
