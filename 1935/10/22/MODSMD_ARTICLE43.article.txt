LET'S GET OFF
THE DIME
Saturday's football game with
Washington is going to be either
won or lost by Thursday. And it
isn't the football team who will de
cide that game, either. It's we who
will spend Saturday afternoon be
fore a loudspeaker.
Here's the big trouble. We're
just too darned used to seeing
Stanford win. For two years now
we have proceeded to tramp over
to the stadium on Saturdays,
watch Stanford win, and leave—
invariably the victors.
We've been taking the team for
granted and we've been taking vic
tory for granted. Until the U.C.L.A.
game we could do that and get
away with it. It's different now.
IT'S TIME FOR
INDIAN UPRISING
Stanford will probably lose to
Washington unless Farm football
followers get off the proverbial dime
between today and Thursday. Even
Tiny Thornhill partially admits that.
It's not that Stanford doesn't
have as powerful a team as the
Huskies. Stanford is certainly as
strong, perhaps stronger. But
Stanford needs moral support to
bring that power to the fore Sat
urday.
It's just been one bad break after
another for Stanford so lar this year.
First Grayson and Topping out, then

I Alustiza for good, and Hamilton
temporarily, and a Uclan defeat.
But with the exception of Alus
tiza's they're all back in fair physical
shape today, and by Saturday they'll
be nearly full strength. But men
tally they're still down. The student
body hasn't been too appreciative
and certainly Lady Luck hasn't
been helpful at all.
What Stanford's team needs
more than anything else is back
ing. They know how to play foot
ball. They've done that, and done
it mighty well for two years. But
they never have been so near the
bottom mentally as right now.
Tomorrow afternoon the Cardinals
plan to hold a "Halt those Huskies"
day at practice. Thursday afternoon
will be the send-off rally. The at
i tendance at those two affairs will
I decide a lot.
If the turnout is good and the
team knows they have backing
like U.C.L.A. did two weeks ago,
Stanford should tear the Huskies
apart.
But if Stanford is indifferent,
doesn't care, the mighty red machine
that rode to the Rose Bowl last year,
i and the year before, might well be
| expected to wind up its third, final,
most important season with the
broken Trojan war horse at the very
bottom of the slide.
How about some help! "It's
time for an Indian uprising."

team knows they have backing
like U.C.L.A. did two weeks ago,
Stanford should tear the Huskies
apart.
But if Stanford is indifferent,
doesn't care, the mighty red machine
that rode to the Rose Bowl last year,
i and the year before, might well be
| expected to wind up its third, final,
most important season with the
broken Trojan war horse at the very
bottom of the slide.
How about some help! "It's
time for an Indian uprising."
LET'S GET OFF
THE DIME
Saturday's football game with
Washington is going to be either
won or lost by Thursday. And it
isn't the football team who will de
cide that game, either. It's we who
will spend Saturday afternoon be
fore a loudspeaker.
Here's the big trouble. We're
just too darned used to seeing
Stanford win. For two years now
we have proceeded to tramp over
to the stadium on Saturdays,
watch Stanford win, and leave—
invariably the victors.
We've been taking the team for
granted and we've been taking vic
tory for granted. Until the U.C.L.A.
game we could do that and get
away with it. It's different now.
IT'S TIME FOR
INDIAN UPRISING
Stanford will probably lose to
Washington unless Farm football
followers get off the proverbial dime
between today and Thursday. Even
Tiny Thornhill partially admits that.
It's not that Stanford doesn't
have as powerful a team as the
Huskies. Stanford is certainly as
strong, perhaps stronger. But
Stanford needs moral support to
bring that power to the fore Sat
urday.
It's just been one bad break after
another for Stanford so lar this year.
First Grayson and Topping out, then

I Alustiza for good, and Hamilton
temporarily, and a Uclan defeat.
But with the exception of Alus
tiza's they're all back in fair physical
shape today, and by Saturday they'll
be nearly full strength. But men
tally they're still down. The student
body hasn't been too appreciative
and certainly Lady Luck hasn't
been helpful at all.
What Stanford's team needs
more than anything else is back
ing. They know how to play foot
ball. They've done that, and done
it mighty well for two years. But
they never have been so near the
bottom mentally as right now.
Tomorrow afternoon the Cardinals
plan to hold a "Halt those Huskies"
day at practice. Thursday afternoon
will be the send-off rally. The at
i tendance at those two affairs will
I decide a lot.
If the turnout is good and the
team knows they have backing
like U.C.L.A. did two weeks ago,
Stanford should tear the Huskies
apart.
