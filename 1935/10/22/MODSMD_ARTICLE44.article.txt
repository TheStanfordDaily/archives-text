### 
Return to practice of Bob Fuller
ton, letterman who was absent from
last Friday's remount scrimmage due
to an ankle injury, featured a spir
ited polo workout on the highway
field yesterday afternoon.
Captain Haydon Grubbs, coach of
the Indian mallet-wielders, greatly
pleased by the showings of a num
ber of green horses in Friday's prac
tice, remarked, "We ought to be bet
ter mounted this year than ever
before."
If the present good weather holds
out for the rest of the week, Grubbs
plans to send his men through an
other scrimmage tomorrow after
noon and then have a practice game
between two teams picked from the
A squad members.
This game is going to be a regu
lation affair using experienced
horses and, besides affording a
chance to get a line on the relative
abilities of the Indians, it should pro
vide plenty of thrills.
