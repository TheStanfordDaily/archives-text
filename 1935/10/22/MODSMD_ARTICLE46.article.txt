# Soccermen To Play Spartans
## 
### 
Showing considerable improve
ment Saturday against U.S.F. and
displaying splendid team work in
practice yesterday, Stanford's soccer
team is looking for a victory over
San Jose State next Saturday!
If the Indians are successful in
the encounter with the Spartans, it
will be their first victory, of the sea
son. They dropped the conference
opener, 2-0, to San Mateo and lost
a heart-breaker to U.S.F. last Satur
day by the slim margin of one pen
alty kick.
Despite the loss, Coach Dick Bullis
was pleased with the showing his
men made and had only words of
praise for them after the game.

San Jose is reported to have a
weak team this year and with the
; improved teamwork of the Stanford
| club, Bullis is confident his squad
I will get its first taste of victory.
Richardson at fullback and Helms
| at goalie have been turning in stellar
i performances the past few days and
i are counted on to aid the home club
1 to win.
