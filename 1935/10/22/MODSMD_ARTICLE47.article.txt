# Indian Water Poloists Meet U.S.C. Friday
## Two Veterans Lost To Stanford Team 
### 
Stanford water poloists will at
i tempt a comeback in their bid for
! Coast honors when they meet a
t powerful U.S.C. squad at Encina
Pools Friday afternoon.
; With the loss of Bill Woodard, ace
j forward and one of the co-captains
! of the Indians, and "Suds" Suther
| land to the varsity squad, a general
{ shake-up in the line-up has resulted.
' But as this week will be devoted to
I strenuous practice the Cardinals
.should play a vastly improved game
! Friday, hopes Coach Nort Thornton.
Saturday afternoon the Indians
; tangle with the strong Olympic Club
I team. The Club men have dropped
i two tilts, one to California by a score
: of 6-5, and the other to the Athens
I Club, after three extra periods of
I play.
As a preliminary feature to Sat
urday's game, five of the nation's
greatest short dash swimmers will
hit the water at 3:15 o'clock in an
official attempt to better the Amer
ican 50-meter free-style record.
Four members of the Stanford var
sity squad — Henry Godman, Jack
Vibert, Alec MacKenzie, and Bill
| Lhamon — and one yearling, Larry
I Pringle, are the men who have been
! consistently cracking the mark of
I 27.2 set by Pau Keoloha of Honolulu
j when he beat Johnny Weismuller.
AA.U. officials and their stop
watches will be on hand for the
| event.
I Admission to the program, which
| includes the Stanford-Olympic Club
j game, the record attempts, and an
[ added diving exhibition, will be free.
! A public address system is to be
used to make explanatory announce
| ments and give quarterly results of
I both the Indian-Washington and the
; U.S.C.-California football tilts.
