# 'College Life' Setting Chosen For Hall Dance
## Toyon Informal To Be Held Friday Evening 
### 
Toyon Hall is rapidly being con
verted into an appropriate setting
for "Collegiate Capers," or college
life as Hollywood sees itâ€”in short,
the Toyon autumn informal set for
Friday evening at 9 o'clock.
Under the guidance of Chairman
Ade Thiel, the dance committee
has contracted with several San
Francisco firms for the decorations
and Carvel Craig and his ten
piece orchestra has been engaged
for the affair.
Craig, say committee members,
offers a distinctive band and will
present as additional entertainment
vocal selections by Eddie Pino,
vibro-harp intermission numbers,
and several skits.
Bids to the dance, priced at $2,
have already been placed on sale
at the A.S.S.U. office. Early reser
vations arc suggested, inasmuch as
bids will be limited to avoid
crowding the dance floor.
Patrons and patronesses chosen
include Mr. and Mrs. Ernest R. Hil
gard, Mr. and Mrs. Stanley L. Sharp,
and Mr. and Mrs. Charles M.
Spraguc. Bill Boyd, Bob Clerk, Bill
Howe, Jack Lloyd, Leo Miller, and
Willard Winder comprise the dance
committee.
