Stanford's 24 fraternities, with "lines" pol
ished and intramural trophies displayed to
best advantage, await the arrival of the Class
of '38's "nuggets" and "legacies" as the first
annual rushing period opens at noon today.
Hushing has been the main topic of conver
sation both in Fncina and on the How during
the past week. Each sitlt* is exceedingly seri
ous in its intent to "make an impression." All
that is part of rushing on any campus.
At this point, the comparison between the
Farm's rushing system and that of most uni
versities terminates, however. Stanford's
whole practice regarding fraternities is to
give the prospective neophyte complete inde
pendence in his choice.
Stanford tradition says that the fraternity
man does not "rate" better or worse than the
hall man either in activities or in society. It
has been an underlying principle among Farm
fraternities that they exist on their merit alone
—that they be perpetuated by freshmen who
pledged because they "like the house and the
fellows" and the fraternal idea.
This principle has led to the present rush
ing system, including three periods this quar
ter and two next quarter, which gives both
frosh and fraternity men an opportunity to

become well acquainted, before they officially
bind themselves to each other late in January.
This policy, codified in a set of rules drawn
up by the Interfraternity Council and en
forced by the Interfraternity Board, helps to
eliminate the type of high-pressuring that
keeps rushees at many colleges in a daze until
after they have pledged to t lie house that has
been most insistent in its demands.
It is impossible to eliminate all of this high
pressure talking. Fraternities naturally are
interested in knowing where they stand and
in lining up their pledge classes as early as
possible. Interfraternity Council makes no
attempt to do away with a reasonable amount
of reeonnoitering. The Council, however,
makes it clear that no pledging before the
official date is binding, and insists that rush
ees remain free from obligating themselves
to a house by refusing to borrow cars or to
accept financial aid from any of its members.
If a fraternity is anxious to pledge a rush
ee, it will not close the bid until he has had
time to make up his mind. Freshmen, who
get their lirst peek at the inside of Stanford's
How today, must realize that Stanford does
not discriminate between Hall and Row, and
that to make ;» house is merely a matter of
personal preference.

time to make up his mind. Freshmen, who
get their lirst peek at the inside of Stanford's
How today, must realize that Stanford does
not discriminate between Hall and Row, and
that to make ;» house is merely a matter of
personal preference.
Stanford's 24 fraternities, with "lines" pol
ished and intramural trophies displayed to
best advantage, await the arrival of the Class
of '38's "nuggets" and "legacies" as the first
annual rushing period opens at noon today.
Hushing has been the main topic of conver
sation both in Fncina and on the How during
the past week. Each sitlt* is exceedingly seri
ous in its intent to "make an impression." All
that is part of rushing on any campus.
At this point, the comparison between the
Farm's rushing system and that of most uni
versities terminates, however. Stanford's
whole practice regarding fraternities is to
give the prospective neophyte complete inde
pendence in his choice.
Stanford tradition says that the fraternity
man does not "rate" better or worse than the
hall man either in activities or in society. It
has been an underlying principle among Farm
fraternities that they exist on their merit alone
—that they be perpetuated by freshmen who
pledged because they "like the house and the
fellows" and the fraternal idea.
This principle has led to the present rush
ing system, including three periods this quar
ter and two next quarter, which gives both
frosh and fraternity men an opportunity to

become well acquainted, before they officially
bind themselves to each other late in January.
This policy, codified in a set of rules drawn
up by the Interfraternity Council and en
forced by the Interfraternity Board, helps to
eliminate the type of high-pressuring that
keeps rushees at many colleges in a daze until
after they have pledged to t lie house that has
been most insistent in its demands.
It is impossible to eliminate all of this high
pressure talking. Fraternities naturally are
interested in knowing where they stand and
in lining up their pledge classes as early as
possible. Interfraternity Council makes no
attempt to do away with a reasonable amount
of reeonnoitering. The Council, however,
makes it clear that no pledging before the
official date is binding, and insists that rush
ees remain free from obligating themselves
to a house by refusing to borrow cars or to
accept financial aid from any of its members.
If a fraternity is anxious to pledge a rush
ee, it will not close the bid until he has had
time to make up his mind. Freshmen, who
