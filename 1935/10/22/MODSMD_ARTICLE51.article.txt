# College President Sees Two Forms of Liberality
## 
### 
When President Rulhven of the University
of Michigan barred three trouble-making stu
dents, he probably little suspected that in
nearby Wisconsin the Milwaukee Journal
would find his act to be a liberal one.
Hut that paper did support the college presi
dent, finding that he was protecting his
school's reputation and the atmosphere in
which his 10,000 students must work. It la
beled his act as constituting a "sane type of
academic freedom," and declared it preferable
to the sickly, sentimental doctrines of freedom
in Wisconsin which even included license to
harm the school and its atmosphere.
Por two years, the three "agitators" had
made life miserable for President Kuthven,
pamphlcting anything the University did,
demonstrating "radically" on every possible
occasion. The president never attempted to
dictate political views to the trouble-makers;
it mattered not if they were communists. lint,
granting them freedom of thought, he felt
himself impelled to oust them when they re
fused that same privilege to others.
Some liberals will no doubt cry out at Kuth
ven in the name of academic fredeoin. But,
iu the Journal's opinion, Kuthven is support
ing academic freedom. He wants all political
doctrines Ireely mooted in the classroom, but
sees a difference between teaching commu
nism and preaching it.
An academic freedom unendangcrcd by agi
tation is Kuthven's ideal. Sanctity of stu
dents' own beliefs and their right to study
as they please* are part of his credo. Hut

parading out to turn the world their way
destroys the freedom of others, puts them in
the nuisance class, ix unfair to other students.
Hence the expulsion.
With the Journal, most Stanford men will
find much liberal ism in this eviction which
; might appear superficially to he provoked by
conservatism.
