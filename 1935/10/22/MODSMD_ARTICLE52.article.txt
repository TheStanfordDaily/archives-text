# Our Hasher Sez

Now that Hell week is with us no more and a
"Pledge Period" has been substituted instead, the fra
ternities confine their activities to ceremonies, which,
I suppose, will be called "Heavenly Days."
Last year, Our Hasher gained a few of his best
enemies when he made certain allegations to the fact
that the Kappa Sigma boys were peeking at Kappas:
This year, he loses some more, when he makes certain
allegations about the Kappas peeking at the Kappa
Sigmas.
The whole, sordid story commences with certain
Heavenly Day practices going on at the Kappa Sigma
house. The neophytes were dressed in little, delicate
feminine things, and were doing a "Life Begins at
Kappa Sigma" act as proof of their virility and ability.
A suspicious brother peered out from behind a
blind, and there were many little Kappa noses tilted
nicely, but pressed tightly, nonetheless, against the
pane.
A favorite trick for Heavenly Days is to have the
neophytes build a fire outside the house or in the
fireplace, and then make them crawl on hands and
knees to an upstairs wash basin, crawl down again,
and put out the fiames by expectorating upon the
flames, like a Japanese wash woman ironing clothes.
This concerns one house that practices this ritual.
Until 2 or .1 o'clock in the morning the neighbors suf
fered their sleep to be disturbed by the recurring calls
of "Fire." Finally, one of the neighbors, or it may have
been a neophyte himself, called up Chief Dugan's boys.
And the whole fire department tumbled out of their
beds and came pounding up the Row in Big Bertha to
help the suffering sophs put out the blaze. The Chief
and his men didn't spit on it, though.
Some of our H-women report that either Our
Hasher was singularly complimented or insulted nt
the Women's Conference Party by the appearance of
several clever hits and misses dressed as hashers and
bedecked with samples of Our Hash's abstruse verbiage
pinned about.
Another incident connected with ihe Conference
Party and hashers occurred at the Chi Omega house
during Friday dinner. As is the custom on the Row
during this annual affair, the Chi O's came to dinner
dressed in their costumes.
Stung to the quick by disparaging remarks about
their lack of any unusual costume, the hashers hastily
organized. They placed a stooge in the audience, who
asked for water at a designated tinn* The house
mother tapped out the usual three-gun «lute on the
buzzer. There came the clang of a firebell, the shrill
of a siren, and in rushed old Fireman Leviticus and his
crew decorated in archaic fire helmets and a gigantic
tirehouse. "Did you l ing, madatne?" said Levit. Every
one agreed it was "good fun."

buzzer. There came the clang of a firebell, the shrill
of a siren, and in rushed old Fireman Leviticus and his
crew decorated in archaic fire helmets and a gigantic
tirehouse. "Did you l ing, madatne?" said Levit. Every
one agreed it was "good fun."
Now that Hell week is with us no more and a
"Pledge Period" has been substituted instead, the fra
ternities confine their activities to ceremonies, which,
I suppose, will be called "Heavenly Days."
Last year, Our Hasher gained a few of his best
enemies when he made certain allegations to the fact
that the Kappa Sigma boys were peeking at Kappas:
This year, he loses some more, when he makes certain
allegations about the Kappas peeking at the Kappa
Sigmas.
The whole, sordid story commences with certain
Heavenly Day practices going on at the Kappa Sigma
house. The neophytes were dressed in little, delicate
feminine things, and were doing a "Life Begins at
Kappa Sigma" act as proof of their virility and ability.
A suspicious brother peered out from behind a
blind, and there were many little Kappa noses tilted
nicely, but pressed tightly, nonetheless, against the
pane.
A favorite trick for Heavenly Days is to have the
neophytes build a fire outside the house or in the
fireplace, and then make them crawl on hands and
knees to an upstairs wash basin, crawl down again,
and put out the fiames by expectorating upon the
flames, like a Japanese wash woman ironing clothes.
This concerns one house that practices this ritual.
Until 2 or .1 o'clock in the morning the neighbors suf
fered their sleep to be disturbed by the recurring calls
of "Fire." Finally, one of the neighbors, or it may have
been a neophyte himself, called up Chief Dugan's boys.
And the whole fire department tumbled out of their
beds and came pounding up the Row in Big Bertha to
help the suffering sophs put out the blaze. The Chief
and his men didn't spit on it, though.
Some of our H-women report that either Our
Hasher was singularly complimented or insulted nt
the Women's Conference Party by the appearance of
several clever hits and misses dressed as hashers and
bedecked with samples of Our Hash's abstruse verbiage
pinned about.
Another incident connected with ihe Conference
Party and hashers occurred at the Chi Omega house
during Friday dinner. As is the custom on the Row
during this annual affair, the Chi O's came to dinner
dressed in their costumes.
Stung to the quick by disparaging remarks about
their lack of any unusual costume, the hashers hastily
organized. They placed a stooge in the audience, who
asked for water at a designated tinn* The house
mother tapped out the usual three-gun «lute on the
buzzer. There came the clang of a firebell, the shrill
of a siren, and in rushed old Fireman Leviticus and his
crew decorated in archaic fire helmets and a gigantic
tirehouse. "Did you l ing, madatne?" said Levit. Every
