# Bull Session
## DEAR AUNT MARY . . . 
### 
Many are the troubles bewildered Robleites bring
to you. And now, added to the physio-psychologic
tales of woe comes one springing from pure economics,
and brought to the fount not by freshwomen, but by
junior and senior girls, themselves mentors to Roble'j
population.
*• * sic
Their perennial glances of envy at Encina sponsors,
who get paid for dinging Stanford's Little Rollos, has
this year materialized into a definite squawk, with
definite suggestions to set things right.
The Encina "Cossacks," women sponsors maintain,
get a free room. The women, it is said, have to pay
for their room in Lonelyheart Hall, and pay more to
get the same thing that men get for nothing. In brass
tack lingo, Roble sponsors shell out precisely $132.50
plus three simoleons compulsory club dues, per quar
ter, plus a lot more of papa's dough to buy nice cur
tains, comfortable furniture, and the right kind of
atmosphere for a "haven of refuge" for the much
loved and unloved.
Which is perhaps o.k. for the Hall woman, but very
likely to bankrupt the Row lassie who wants to do
her bit. The girl on the Row, female agents tell us,
must in addition to fulfilling Roble sponsor require
ments, pay house dues, which are said to range from
$8 to $15 per month. These dues, we learn, would ordi
narily be included in a house room and board bill, in
many cases totaling less than Roble room and board.
* * * *
If the buller has his facts right, the system as now
instituted is definitely biased in favor of the Hall
woman, and against the Row.
But looking at the system from a broader viewpoint,
including Encina policing and Roble shoulder exer
cise, how come?
Though the Encina sponsor exists rather than lives,
though'he's liable to be drenched, burned, and hound
ed, though he's got to keep the eagle eye open for
bombs and fourth-floor campfires, has he got a job
actually harder than the Roble mentor?
While she is living like a human being physically,
she must be ready at any waking hour to listen to
troubled women, allow her lapel to be tear-washed,
and prepare new and unique solutions for mole
hillish difficulties.
* * * *
Isn't her function just as important, though not in
saving university property, as that of the Encina spon
sor? And if it is just as important, shouldn't she get
the same financial breaks as he does?
Dean Yost has told women sponsors that she would
"hate to feel that the girls she asked to help would
want payment, considering payment or compensa
tion as free room. The girls feel the same way about it.
It isn t the idea, it's the dough—and the economic
gymnastics of making a budget stretch from the Row
to the Hall. —Bob Eisenbach

this year materialized into a definite squawk, with
definite suggestions to set things right.
The Encina "Cossacks," women sponsors maintain,
get a free room. The women, it is said, have to pay
for their room in Lonelyheart Hall, and pay more to
get the same thing that men get for nothing. In brass
tack lingo, Roble sponsors shell out precisely $132.50
plus three simoleons compulsory club dues, per quar
ter, plus a lot more of papa's dough to buy nice cur
tains, comfortable furniture, and the right kind of
atmosphere for a "haven of refuge" for the much
loved and unloved.
Which is perhaps o.k. for the Hall woman, but very
likely to bankrupt the Row lassie who wants to do
her bit. The girl on the Row, female agents tell us,
must in addition to fulfilling Roble sponsor require
ments, pay house dues, which are said to range from
$8 to $15 per month. These dues, we learn, would ordi
narily be included in a house room and board bill, in
many cases totaling less than Roble room and board.

If the buller has his facts right, the system as now
instituted is definitely biased in favor of the Hall
woman, and against the Row.
But looking at the system from a broader viewpoint,
including Encina policing and Roble shoulder exer
cise, how come?
Though the Encina sponsor exists rather than lives,
though'he's liable to be drenched, burned, and hound
ed, though he's got to keep the eagle eye open for
bombs and fourth-floor campfires, has he got a job
actually harder than the Roble mentor?
While she is living like a human being physically,
she must be ready at any waking hour to listen to
troubled women, allow her lapel to be tear-washed,
and prepare new and unique solutions for mole
hillish difficulties.

Isn't her function just as important, though not in
saving university property, as that of the Encina spon
sor? And if it is just as important, shouldn't she get
the same financial breaks as he does?
Dean Yost has told women sponsors that she would
"hate to feel that the girls she asked to help would
want payment, considering payment or compensa
tion as free room. The girls feel the same way about it.
It isn t the idea, it's the dough—and the economic
gymnastics of making a budget stretch from the Row
to the Hall. —Bob Eisenbach
Many are the troubles bewildered Robleites bring
to you. And now, added to the physio-psychologic
tales of woe comes one springing from pure economics,
and brought to the fount not by freshwomen, but by
junior and senior girls, themselves mentors to Roble'j
population.
