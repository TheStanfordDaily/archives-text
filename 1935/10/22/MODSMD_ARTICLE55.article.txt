English class in his "Of Time and the
River."
STAR CRITICISM: Asked what
he thought was Theodore Dreiser's
best writing, Sinclair Lewis replied,
"The words he wrote for that senti

Herbert Marshall's acting might be
blamed on his wooden leg. . . .
George Gershwin, the boy with the
hairlip who used to play the har
monica, will revolutionize opera

received a fan letter containing only
a piece of ham.
UNRED FACE: In the midst of a
