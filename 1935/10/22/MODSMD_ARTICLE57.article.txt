# HALT THOSE HUSKIES

The Editor, Sir:
The Stanford "Big Red Machine"
was beaten some two weeks ago by
a not altogether superior U.C.L.A.
outfit. I was working in the U.CL.A.
stands during the game and had a
good opportunity to observe said
rooting section.
In my opinion it was the tre
mendous support given the Bruin
team by their rooting section that
contributed mostly to the Bruin vic
tory. The rooters were behind the
players in a most inspiring way. The
Bruin team couldn't help but no
tice and profit by such a display.
Let's . . . give the team the best
send-off it ever had—backed by at
least 3000 students down there at
the station, from all houses, eating
clubs, and living groups.
