# THIEVELESS UTOPIA
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Before coming to Stanford, I had
always dreamed of a Utopian college,
where there would be no thieves.
With this thought in mind, I left
my leather-bound notebook and
history book in the holder provided
for this purpose inside the library
and went to the post office. When I
returned, my new history book was
gone. My notebook was not gone,
which contained all my notes, ex
ceedingly valuable to me. 1
I wish to thank whoever "bor
rowed" my book for their kindness
in leaving my notebook.
