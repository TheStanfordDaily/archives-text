Stanford women, while not in
cluded in the "labor detail," will
have an active part in making the
Big Game Bonfire a fitting climax
to campus preparations for toppling
the California Bears from football
heights, according to Bob Hoover,
director of arrangements.
Hoover said yesterday Dean Mary
Yost had indicated women would
be permitted to serve luncheon to
men aiding in building operations.
Hoover has appointed Jeanette
Munkelt and Peggy Sims to the cen
tral committee and they will be in
charge of the luncheon.
In addition, Hoover and Bob Jones,
co-chairmen, urge women of Hall
and Row to co-operate in collecting
wood for the fire. They point out
that, although the framework prob
ably will be of telephone poles and
railroad ties, hundreds of boxes and
all available scrap wood will be
needed to complete the pyre.
