# Brooke Will Go To Seattle For Pre-Game Meet
## Ex Committee Postpones Theater Dedication Until February; Votes $100 for Bonfire; Lowers Dance Price to 75 cents 
### ANNALEE WHITMORE 
President VVally Brooke will travel to Seattle 'or a pre-game speech,
derided Ex Committee last night. Their action sets a precedent—Brooke
will be the first A.S.S.U. head in recent years to make the Washington
journey.
Bobby Grayson voiced approval. "Those people in the northwest hate
our intestinal fortitude," he said. "The spirit between the two schools

certainly needs something. Ex Com
mittee agreed. Eighty dollars was
voted.
DEDICATION of the new $560,000
theater will be postponed until early
in February — first, because a
ground-breaking would be less im
pressive, and second, because it
would rush preparations of a suit
able ceremony. Cornerstone-laying
will be planned for early winter
quarter.
FOLDER DIVIDER system should
be revised, said ex-President Mar
vie Kahn. He outlined five reforms,
which were deferred for later con
sideration.
PUBLIC ADDRESS equipment,
"the whit; elephant which, at last,
finally works," needs a definite pol
icy, said Bob Gros. A scaled list of
charges was finally drawn up
whereby A.S.S.U. will use the ampli
fier at actual cost, affiliated activi
ties at cost plus 50 per cent, the
University at cost plus $1 an hour,
and outside organizations at cost
plus $1.50 an hour.
"That last is just to placate the
University," explained the student
manager. "They'll feel better if they
aren't charged most, even if we
never actually rent it outside." A
lapel microphone will be bought
soon from the new replacement
fund, he .said.
BONFIRE PLANS may proceed
■with Ex Committee approval, plus a
budget of $100.
"We've done away with so much
tradition that we've almost killed
school spirit," said Grayson. "The
reaction was especially noticeable
when Washington agitation started
this week. A bonfire is not high
schoollsh-—it definitely helps the
football team, and I'm in favor of it."
Bob Jones, last year's chairman,
pointed out that the entire struc-'
ture can be built in a day, and that
ihe actual cost is only one-fourth
that of the fire three years ago.
CARDINAL MINUTES were read
and approved peacefully until the
suggestion that Cardinals be ad
mitted free to all Cardinal functions
was reached. Ex Committee sug
gested modestly that they would
pass the measure id! they, too, were
allowed to join thelgravy train and
be admitted free.
Better nature- triumphed. There
will be no gravy train.
ORCHESTRA SERVICE, whereby
;i central bureau will provide eon
tact with big-name -orchestras, was
outlined and approved.
QUAD SPACE resulted in rent
ing of the traditional two pages.
"We should have an extra half page
for the theater plans;," said Brooke.
"Nuts," remarked the practical
Frank Fullenwider. "We can get
the architects to put one in and pay
advertising rates."
ARMISTICE DAY assembly will
be A.S.S.U.-sponsortid, decided the
group. But it will ncn. be rampantly
pacifistic. Jean Anderson as chair
man, assisted by Bryan Moore and
Adrienne Jonhston, will pirn the
program.
THE Y.W.C.A. is out for U.S.C.
week-end, according to Women's
Conference. They haven't room
enough. But the few women plan
ning to stay at. hotels will be pro
vided for, said Mercedes Bergman,
in accordance with the Conference
regulation that women should not
go to a hotel unchaperor.ed.
DATES GRANTED included Ch;

7 to 8, November 13. Tuesday dates
already granted which conflict with
the lecture series will be asked to
shift.
SANTA CLARA dance, slated for
November 2, will feature a lowered
j admission rate. "If we cut out the
crooner and the punich, we can
I charge 75 cents a couple and still
i come out ahead," reported Gros.
"Okay—Nix on Nix," was heard
I from the sidelines.
Gros called attention to the fact
that the post-Gaieties dance is still
j without a sponsor. Any organiza
-1 tion wanting to present it may use
i the Gaieties orchestra at a special
i rate, he pointed out.

"Okay—Nix on Nix," was heard

Gros called attention to the fact
that the post-Gaieties dance is still

President VVally Brooke will travel to Seattle 'or a pre-game speech,
derided Ex Committee last night. Their action sets a precedent—Brooke
will be the first A.S.S.U. head in recent years to make the Washington
journey.
Bobby Grayson voiced approval. "Those people in the northwest hate
our intestinal fortitude," he said. "The spirit between the two schools

certainly needs something. Ex Com
mittee agreed. Eighty dollars was

DEDICATION of the new $560,000
theater will be postponed until early
in February — first, because a
ground-breaking would be less im

PUBLIC ADDRESS equipment,
"the whit; elephant which, at last,
finally works," needs a definite pol
icy, said Bob Gros. A scaled list of
charges was finally drawn up
whereby A.S.S.U. will use the ampli
fier at actual cost, affiliated activi
ties at cost plus 50 per cent, the
University at cost plus $1 an hour,
and outside organizations at cost
plus $1.50 an hour.
"That last is just to placate the
University," explained the student
manager. "They'll feel better if they
aren't charged most, even if we
never actually rent it outside." A
lapel microphone will be bought
soon from the new replacement
fund, he .said.
BONFIRE PLANS may proceed
■with Ex Committee approval, plus a
budget of $100.
"We've done away with so much
tradition that we've almost killed
school spirit," said Grayson. "The
reaction was especially noticeable
when Washington agitation started
this week. A bonfire is not high
schoollsh-—it definitely helps the
football team, and I'm in favor of it."
Bob Jones, last year's chairman,
pointed out that the entire struc-'

ihe actual cost is only one-fourth
that of the fire three years ago.
CARDINAL MINUTES were read

ORCHESTRA SERVICE, whereby

SANTA CLARA dance, slated for
November 2, will feature a lowered
j admission rate. "If we cut out the
crooner and the punich, we can
I charge 75 cents a couple and still
i come out ahead," reported Gros.
"Okay—Nix on Nix," was heard
I from the sidelines.
Gros called attention to the fact
that the post-Gaieties dance is still
j without a sponsor. Any organiza
-1 tion wanting to present it may use
i the Gaieties orchestra at a special
i rate, he pointed out.
President VVally Brooke will travel to Seattle 'or a pre-game speech,
derided Ex Committee last night. Their action sets a precedent—Brooke
will be the first A.S.S.U. head in recent years to make the Washington
journey.
Bobby Grayson voiced approval. "Those people in the northwest hate
our intestinal fortitude," he said. "The spirit between the two schools

certainly needs something. Ex Com
mittee agreed. Eighty dollars was
voted.
DEDICATION of the new $560,000
theater will be postponed until early
in February — first, because a
ground-breaking would be less im
pressive, and second, because it
would rush preparations of a suit
able ceremony. Cornerstone-laying
will be planned for early winter
quarter.
FOLDER DIVIDER system should
be revised, said ex-President Mar
vie Kahn. He outlined five reforms,
which were deferred for later con
sideration.
PUBLIC ADDRESS equipment,
"the whit; elephant which, at last,
finally works," needs a definite pol
icy, said Bob Gros. A scaled list of
charges was finally drawn up
whereby A.S.S.U. will use the ampli
fier at actual cost, affiliated activi
ties at cost plus 50 per cent, the
University at cost plus $1 an hour,
and outside organizations at cost
plus $1.50 an hour.
"That last is just to placate the
University," explained the student
manager. "They'll feel better if they
aren't charged most, even if we
never actually rent it outside." A
lapel microphone will be bought
soon from the new replacement
fund, he .said.
BONFIRE PLANS may proceed
■with Ex Committee approval, plus a
budget of $100.
"We've done away with so much
tradition that we've almost killed
school spirit," said Grayson. "The
reaction was especially noticeable
when Washington agitation started
this week. A bonfire is not high
schoollsh-—it definitely helps the
football team, and I'm in favor of it."
Bob Jones, last year's chairman,
pointed out that the entire struc-'
ture can be built in a day, and that
ihe actual cost is only one-fourth
that of the fire three years ago.
CARDINAL MINUTES were read
and approved peacefully until the
suggestion that Cardinals be ad
mitted free to all Cardinal functions
was reached. Ex Committee sug
gested modestly that they would
pass the measure id! they, too, were
allowed to join thelgravy train and
be admitted free.
Better nature- triumphed. There
will be no gravy train.
ORCHESTRA SERVICE, whereby
;i central bureau will provide eon
tact with big-name -orchestras, was
outlined and approved.
QUAD SPACE resulted in rent
ing of the traditional two pages.
"We should have an extra half page
for the theater plans;," said Brooke.
"Nuts," remarked the practical
Frank Fullenwider. "We can get
the architects to put one in and pay
advertising rates."
ARMISTICE DAY assembly will
be A.S.S.U.-sponsortid, decided the
group. But it will ncn. be rampantly
pacifistic. Jean Anderson as chair
man, assisted by Bryan Moore and
Adrienne Jonhston, will pirn the
program.
