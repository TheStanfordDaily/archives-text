## Ex Committee Postpones Theater Dedication Until February; Votes $100 for Bonfire; Lowers Dance Price to 75 cents 
### ANNALEE WHITMORE 
President VVally Brooke will travel to Seattle 'or a pre-game speech,
derided Ex Committee last night. Their action sets a precedent—Brooke
will be the first A.S.S.U. head in recent years to make the Washington
journey.
Bobby Grayson voiced approval. "Those people in the northwest hate
our intestinal fortitude," he said. "The spirit between the two schools

certainly needs something. Ex Com
mittee agreed. Eighty dollars was
voted.
DEDICATION of the new $560,000
theater will be postponed until early
in February — first, because a
ground-breaking would be less im

lapel microphone will be bought
soon from the new replacement
fund, he .said.
BONFIRE PLANS may proceed
■with Ex Committee approval, plus a
budget of $100.
"We've done away with so much
tradition that we've almost killed
school spirit," said Grayson. "The
reaction was especially noticeable
when Washington agitation started
this week. A bonfire is not high
schoollsh-—it definitely helps the
football team, and I'm in favor of it."
Bob Jones, last year's chairman,
pointed out that the entire struc-'
ture can be built in a day, and that
ihe actual cost is only one-fourth
that of the fire three years ago.
CARDINAL MINUTES were read
and approved peacefully until the
suggestion that Cardinals be ad

was reached. Ex Committee sug
