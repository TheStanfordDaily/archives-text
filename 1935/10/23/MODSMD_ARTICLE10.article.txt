## 
### 
"The gossipy tongue of one wom
an, just as in modern times, causes
the destruction of Valhalla, and pro
vides the basis for the whole Ring,"
said Maud Fay Symington, Ameri
can operatic star, in her lecture
recital on "Richard Wagner and his
Ring" last night.
"One Rhinemaiden who incau
tiously reveals the power of the
Ring on the hand of someone who
has renounced love, brings about
the twilight of the Gods, and paves
the way for the life and death of
Siegfried."
Mrs. Symington tied her story to
Modern life, showing that our life
and that of the Gods in the King
are essentially the same. She hu
morously pointed ollt in telling of

! Fricka who builds beautiful Val
halla to keep Wotan at home, that
"it takes more than four walls to
keep even a god at home."
Wagner, Mr. Symington said,
wrote the Ring backward. First he
wrote of Siegfried's death, and to
explain that, wrote "Siegfried. '
Then he conceived "Die Walkure,"
but when he began composing, he
did it in the proper order. This took
Wagner 26 years; so, when he .wrote
"Die Walkure," the American so
prano pointed out, he had had all
the experiences of life.
As Alfred Hurt gen, pianist,
played. Mrs. Symington told the
story of "Das Rheingold" atid
"Die Walkure," describing each
scene, and singing the call ol the
I Valkyrie.
