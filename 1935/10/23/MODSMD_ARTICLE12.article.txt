# Frosh Men To Hear Honor Code Talks
## 
### 
Mens Council will discuss the Honor Code in an assembly in the
Encina lobby tonight at 8:15 o'clock, Bob Gros, chairman of the council,
announced last night. Frosh attendance is compulsory.
In past years it has been the custom of the council to instruct frosh
in small groups. Inasmuch as this proceduce required too much time,

â–ºthe council has decided to adopt a
; new method and take the freshman
class en masse, Gros said.
"In the past, freshmen frequently
cheated on examinations before
Men's Council had a chance to ex
plain the Honor Code system to
| them, ' Gros declared. "By telling
j the entire freshman class at once,
j and early in the quarter, ignorance
I of the code and its sacredness will no
j longer be an excuse for irregular
j practices."
; Impressing the yearlings with the
code's applications to life, as well
| as to the classroom, are to be stressed
l under the new system. Students
puzzled by ethical problems will
have a chance to obtain all the an
j swers at meetings to be held Mon
; day afternoons following the regular
session of Men's Council, Gros de
clared.
Gros and Alf Brandin, a council
member, will speak at the meeting.
Following the general assembly
small groups will be taken over by
each member of the council for in
| formal discussion.
Those aiding Gros in group meet
ings are George Leedy, Gib Hollo
way, Alf Brandin, and Brower Del
linger.
1 At the conclusion of the Men's
. Council meeting, Ed Littlefield, In
terfraternity Council president, will
give the frosh instructions regarding
the rushing periods and their regu
; lations.
