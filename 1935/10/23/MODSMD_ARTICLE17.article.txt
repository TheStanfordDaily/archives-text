Descriptions of his tour of Europe
last summer were told yesterday by
Wally Brooke, A.S.S.U. president,
who, together with Hobart Batson,
'35, and Bill Garth, '36, bicycled and
flew around England and the Conti
nent.
The main purpose of Brooke's
visit was to attend the Interna
tional Student Body President's
Convention, which was held in
I'rague, Czechoslovakia.
Attended by American, French,
German, Swiss, and Italian students,
the convention devoted itself to the
discussion of problems of interna
tional good will, and the inter-rela
tionship between universities and
their exchange students.
Conversation Easy
"Since most of the students were
very proficient in languages, I had
no trouble conversing with them."
Brooke claimed. "But," he said, "the
addresses were spoken in French,
and stopped me cold."
Following the convention, the
party Hew to Cologne. Germany,
where the\ bought bicycles and

started on a month's tour of Ger
many and Switzerland. They vis
ited Heidelberg and the Black
Forest, often traveling 70 miles a
day.
Brooke claimed the life in the
German "Casthaus," or inn, was a
very pleasant one, and they often
swapped stories over a stein of beer
with ine German peasants and trav
elers.
Lives Swiss Style
In order to get a real idea of for
eign life and to improve his German,
Brooke lived with a Swiss family for
a week.
While biking along the Rhine in
Germany, Brooke and his company
ions met A1 and Don Blackmail and
Bill Bcatty, '35.
Many points of interest in Eng
land were visited by the trio. They
took in the British law courts and
Parliament, and were much im
pressed by the very conservative
attitude displayed by members of
that party.
Altogether, Brooke estimated thai
they traveled about 10.000 miles,
I'rOO of which were by plane.
