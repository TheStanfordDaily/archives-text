# Stark Urges Big Send-Off For Gridders
## 
### 
U.C.L.A. came north of the
opinion to a man that they
could and would not be de
feated. The spirit that was en
gendered in the student body
was transmitted into the minds
of the team with horrible re
sults to us.
You, every une of you stu
dents, must bp present at the
two public demonstrations of
our confidence in our varsity.
You must bs present at the
students practice held today at
4:30 o'clock on the practice
field.
And more important you
must be present at the team
send-olf rally to be held at the
station at 4 o'clock tomorrow.
If our varsity i-ealizes that
we are all behind them, every
one of us, I don't believe they
could let us down.
â€”Yell Leader Dick Stark
