# First Eleven Confident Of Husky Win After Tough Practice
## 
### Bob Leland 
After watching Tiny Thornhill
and Company go through a hard
practice session yesterday in prepa
ration for their toughest game in
years, your scribe could not help
but be impressed by the dash and
fire of the regulars.
Now intact, except for Frankie
Alustiza, the "serious seniors"
charged about the field shouting en
couragement to each other as they
ran through signal drill. They re
alize they are in for a tough contest.
Some comments made last night
for the Daily show just how the
players feel. Dale Beedle, sophomore
right tackle: "As far as I am con
cerned this game might be with Ohio
State or any of them. I feel this is
our week, and that we can win."
Ail-American Bob Reynolds, left
tacklo, in his usual serious attitude,
remarked: "This is the best team
we've met since we came here.
Blocking and fight will win, and if
we can block as we have in previous
seasons, we'll beat 'em."
All-American Monk Moscrip
and his running mate, Keith Top
ping, ends, added their comments.
Monk: "We've got as good a team
as they have. Wc beat them last
year and we can do it again."
Keith: "It'll be the toughest game
we've ever played, but we've got
two sets of good backs, and any of
thcin can go to town if the line
can open holes."
Down to actual details. Bones
Hamilton was out and seemed not to
be favoring his bad leg. He was run
ning plays from the fullback posi
tion, and may be held out of the
game to relieve Bobby Grayson. Joe
Vigna and Jim Coftis worked in a
first-string backfield with Grayson
j and Bill Paulman. In the second
1 combination were Hamilton, Tom
Collins, Johnny Campbell, and
Johnny Reisner.
In front of these men was the
; regular forward wall of Moscrip,
1 Woody Adams, We& Mullcr, Larry
; Rouble, Reynolds, Beedle, and
Topping, and the second string of
A1 Trompas, Bob Black, Alf Bran
din, I)ave Cuneo, Pop Grant,
Harry Carlson, and Carl SchotL
Brandin and Black are nearly on a
par with Muller and Adams, while
Carlson has been pushing Beedle for
i his tackle berth. All these men will
probably see action before the game
! is over.
It is interesting to note that al
j though the Indians were supposed to
1 be at their weakest for this game,
i only Alustiza, Olcott, and Clarke are
; missing from the first three teams.
The ranks of the "bandage brigade"
j are slowly diminishing.

In front of these men was the
; regular forward wall of Moscrip,
1 Woody Adams, We& Mullcr, Larry
; Rouble, Reynolds, Beedle, and
Topping, and the second string of
A1 Trompas, Bob Black, Alf Bran
din, I)ave Cuneo, Pop Grant,
Harry Carlson, and Carl SchotL
Brandin and Black are nearly on a
par with Muller and Adams, while
Carlson has been pushing Beedle for
i his tackle berth. All these men will
probably see action before the game
! is over.
It is interesting to note that al
j though the Indians were supposed to
1 be at their weakest for this game,
i only Alustiza, Olcott, and Clarke are
; missing from the first three teams.
The ranks of the "bandage brigade"
j are slowly diminishing.
After watching Tiny Thornhill
and Company go through a hard
practice session yesterday in prepa
ration for their toughest game in
years, your scribe could not help
but be impressed by the dash and
fire of the regulars.
Now intact, except for Frankie
Alustiza, the "serious seniors"
charged about the field shouting en
couragement to each other as they
ran through signal drill. They re
alize they are in for a tough contest.
Some comments made last night
for the Daily show just how the
players feel. Dale Beedle, sophomore
right tackle: "As far as I am con
cerned this game might be with Ohio
State or any of them. I feel this is
our week, and that we can win."
Ail-American Bob Reynolds, left
tacklo, in his usual serious attitude,
remarked: "This is the best team
we've met since we came here.
Blocking and fight will win, and if
we can block as we have in previous
seasons, we'll beat 'em."
All-American Monk Moscrip
and his running mate, Keith Top
ping, ends, added their comments.
Monk: "We've got as good a team
as they have. Wc beat them last
year and we can do it again."
Keith: "It'll be the toughest game
we've ever played, but we've got
two sets of good backs, and any of
thcin can go to town if the line
can open holes."
Down to actual details. Bones
Hamilton was out and seemed not to
be favoring his bad leg. He was run
ning plays from the fullback posi
tion, and may be held out of the
game to relieve Bobby Grayson. Joe
Vigna and Jim Coftis worked in a
first-string backfield with Grayson
j and Bill Paulman. In the second
1 combination were Hamilton, Tom
Collins, Johnny Campbell, and
Johnny Reisner.
