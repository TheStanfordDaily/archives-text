# New Papoose Lineup Points For San Mateo
## 
### 
Stanford's frosh football men may
be pointing for the Little Big Game
November 9, but they aren't for
getting their tussle with San Mateo
J.C. Saturday. That much was evi
dent last night as Coach Jimmy
Bradshaw ran the regulars through
a brisk scrimmage against the re
serves on defense.
Alustiza at Half
After a period of light signal drill
like Monday's, the first-string year
lings lined up with Andy Stojkovich
and Don Butler, ends; Dave Carna
han and Pete Zagar, tackles; Frank
McMillan and Fred Gustafson,
guards; Dick Sutton, center; Ed Gar
nier, quarterback; Pete Fay and A1
Alustiza, halfbacks; and Wally De-
Witt, fullback.
Alustiza ran with the first string
yesterday in the place of Bill Kirsch,
whose hip is still banged up. Stoj
kovich and Butler were at the end
positions usually handled by Irv
Cummings and Walt Hege, both of
whom have sprained ankles. Pete
Fay has replaced Henry Glasser as
regular left half and the stocky
former Galileo back looked good
yesterday.
Practice New Plays
With Pete Zagar, giant tackle,
leading the interference, Bradshaw
concentrated on two plays yester
day. One was a short, behind-the
line pass from Wally DeWitt to Fay,
and the other was a lateral from
Kirsch to DeWitt, followed by a long
forward to Fay, far down on the
right. The latter play was re
hearsed in signal drill, before Alus
tiza replaced Kirsch at right half.
