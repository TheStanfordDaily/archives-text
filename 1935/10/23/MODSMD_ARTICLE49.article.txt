# Prodigal Asta Returns Home-Bleached Blond!
## 
### BOB EISENBACH 
Stanford's Asta is the Mrs. De
Stress of turtledom.
For almost a year since she was
presented to Jim Triolo, former yell
leader, following the loss of Owl
Emma at the U.C.L.A. game, Asta
has been farmed out on the estate of
Coach Husky Hunt, down Palo Alto
way, where she's snubbing the
gophers and field mice in pseudo
patrician style, getting special meals
from the Hunt back door, anci wait
ing with a sort of militant resigna
tion for Jim and Dick Stark to patch
things up with her after a year's
deseration.
Yesterday Stark went to the
Hunt estate to bring Asta home in
accordance with a new move to
present her as the official Indian
mascot. But she wasn't the old
girl he knewâ€”Asta had turned
blonde!
Whether it was her vegetarian
diet or just feminine perversity,
Stark can't tell. But Asta's shell, he
recounted, was distinctly titian.
Though Asta showed no other evi
dences of feminine prettying, Dick
says he's going to put a stop to any
ideas of beauty she may have.
he fears, might some day find an
eligible he-turtle, and quit her busi
ness of yell-inspirer. Dick plans,
therefore, to paint her shell white,
with a red "S" in the center of it.

Just how he's going to arrange
Asia's act during games is a tough
problem, he admitted. Emma, the
iron owl, could be hung on the
microphone, or stuffed into pock
ets, or thrown into suitcases,
while Asta will probably have to
have a platform all her own.
Stark plans building a small ha
i cienda, sort of a turtle kennel, as
! Asta's home. On the way to Wash
ington Saturday she will share the
lower berth with Chuck Whetmore
and Frankie Alustiza. "It's a cinch
I she won't sleep with me," Stark de
clared.
