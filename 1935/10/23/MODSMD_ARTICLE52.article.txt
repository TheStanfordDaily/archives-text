WASHINGTON GOOD?
PLENTY, SAYS WUIUiAY

How wa.s Washington, Murray?
It was the sideliner springing hi.s
time-worn query on another victim
; —this time head Stanford scout
Murray Cuddeback who returned
from the Huskies' lair Monday noon
with word of Jimmy Phelan's men.
"They looked like the best hall
club I've seen in two years. And
I'm not saying that just to try to
1 get you fired up, either. That's a
fact."
Now those who know Murray un
, derstand that he's not one to waste
words. And when he blasts out with
I a statement like that it means that
there's something really potent
prompting him to talk.
He went on: "Against Santa Clara
three weeks ago they looked good
but last Saturday they were almost
perfect. They've got a great kicker,
a hard line bucker, and their pass
ing is plenty good.
"This fellow Byron Haines is a
wonderful halfback. On the first
play of tiie game last week he ran
j 70 yards through U.S.C. for a
touchdown. He passes and kicks
well, and he's fast.
"The other half is Jim Ct'in. 1
think he's a little faster than Haines
; but hasn't learned to make the best
i use of it yet. He's another passer,
; throws with his right; Haines throws
: left-handed.
Murray wasn't through talking by
j this time, either. "Then there's this
quarterback Elmer Logg. He's the
I fellow who punted 76 yards on a
I quick kick against us last year. He's
I a fine field general and a good place
' kicker.
"Cuddy" was full of good words
I for the Huskies, but he figures that
j Stanford will handle them all right,
if the breaks are at all favorable.

"Sure," says he, "Washington's
plenty good, but Stanford's going to
be just a little better than the Hus
kies Saturday."
