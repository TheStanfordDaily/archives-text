## Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily The 						Fight for the Rose Bowl Is On Bull Session's Freedom of Expression Makes It a Valuable Daily Feature 
### 
Nine years ago the Daily gave form and
substance to an old Farm habit —the Bull
Session. The original idea was to follow what
ever the title might suggest—in short, any
thing and everything worthy of discussion.
First Bull Sessioner was witty Stephen
O'Donncll, now editor-in-chief of the twin
Los Angeles dailies, Posl-liccoril and Daily
News. Following him came a long line of
worthy successors clever men all, who raised
the column to the peak of most popular fea
ture in the Daily. Last of the line were the
two MellinkolTs, whose flowing vocabularies,
liberality, and love of argument endeared
them to Farm readers.
So long was the Bull Session connected to
I he McllinkolV name that when they went, the
suggestion was made that Bidl Session also
go. To the Daily, the thought of losing a
friend in the guise of such a unique column
was insufferable. Messrs. Kisenbach and Me
(Wclland, two regular stall' members and not
primarily writers of Bull Scssionish material,
rallied to fill the void.
This thev have done. A few "Vox Campi"
contributors have taken exception to them
and to their remarks. Although their view
points may not have'quite the liberality be
fore characterizing the column, or their pens
quite the facility of the last two super-pro
tagonists, the mere fact that students are
interested enough to lake exception to their
stands proves that they are not letting Bull
Session go stale.

Peculiarly diilieult to write is a Hull Ses
sion. It can discuss, preach, banter, review,
antagonize, investigate, criticize. Wide are
its limits, and critical its readers. Since every
man is a bull-sessioner in his own right—for
who in college is so dead that he heeds not'
the call of midnight talkfests lit* feels that
he could certainly do a wittier, livelier job
than the man with pen-in-hand.
At its inception, Bull Session did just that:
let anyone who had the urge write a contri
bution. But that appealing ideal had to be
abandoned because those unaccustomed to
writing for publication could not be recon
ciled to the circumscribed breezes that con
stitute the winds of freedom as they blow on
a printed page.
The proboscis of the Bull-Sessioner is con
tinually waving in those breezes. Because he
picks controversial topics, someone is always
waiting to pin on his beagle the charge that
he is a "lousy conservative," a "dirty radical,"
or that he is just plain "oil' the boat."
Discontent with the column is likely to he
heightened because every man has his own
idea of what a good Bull Session should have
as its topic. And, after all, the printed mono
logic session which must he read by both sexes
cannot in its nature be as spicy as its oral,
often unisexual, give-and-take prototype.
The Daily at any time may not be over
joyed with the Bull-Sessioner or his views;
yet. like Voltaire, it feels that although it may
heartily disapprove of what he says, it will
defend to the last bis right to say it.
