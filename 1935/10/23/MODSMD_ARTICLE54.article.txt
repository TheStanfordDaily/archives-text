# "Vox Campi" Bows To Campus Voice
## 
### 
Brought home to the Daily Monday was
a fallacy which has long existed in its cam
pus opinion columns. Shy contributors, lack
ing nerve to put their full names in cold, black
print, have been permitted to sign only their
initials.
This led to much bawlout-thumbing and
fun for all, save those who might happen to
have the same initials as the contributors.
Often they did not care to share the onus of
a campus opinion viewpoint.
Starling today, "Vox Campi" letters will
carry either full names of contributors or
phoney pseudonyms, such as "Disgruntled
Student," "Fiery I'rosh," or "Glad-handing
Joe." Actual names of contributors, however,
must be turned in with letters to the Daily
before publication will be permitted.
As usual, the Daily will accept any letters
of a non-malicious nature from any campus
residents, print them gladly, subject only to
good taste and deletions made necessary by
space requirements.
