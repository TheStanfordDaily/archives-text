# Toning Down of Discrimination Hits Olympic Boycotters
## 
### 
Hrigadier General Charles H. Sherill, lead
ing member <>1 the American Olympic Com
mittee and ail aide diplomat, Ave 11 versed in
Continental psychology and the workings at
the European capitals, has returned from an
investigation into German Olympic prepara
tions with some timely remarks.
More pertinent, during the current agita
tion for an American Olympic boycott, than
the fact that he reported no signs of discrimi
nation against .Jewish and Catholic athletes
in Nazi Germany's preparations for the
Gaines, was General Sherrill's statement that:
"If our .lews force us to stav out of the

Olympic Games they will he taking a great
chanee with their own comfort and liberty.
. . . I think it is a mistake on the part ol'
Jewish leaders to stir up antagonism."
At least in the ease, of athletes until after
the Games next summer, Hitler will refrain
from religious persecutions. All indications
point to the conclusion that he will not dis
criminate against races in the forthcoming
()lvmpiad.
Instead of looking upon Germany's claim
of non-discrimination suspiciously, the anti-
Nazis would help their cause more by gra
ciously accepting this move of Hitler's —his
lirst sign of reversing in his religious policy.
The constant complaints and protests that
American Jews are directing at Germany will
be of no avail in changing the situation; Hitler
already realizes they are opposed to his prac
tices. However, now that he has backed down,
although only temporarily, objectors would J
add weight to their complaints by being the®
first to recognize it and attempt to make the
non-discrimination a permanent thing.
