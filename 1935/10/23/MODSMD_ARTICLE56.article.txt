We still hear tales of the U.C.L.A. week-end. It
seems that some U.C.L.A. Thetas had a date with
some Encina men. When time came for the festivals
to commence, the girl drove over in her car and gath
ered in the two freshmen. She then took them up to
the Theta house to acquire the second woman. She
said, "Just a minute," and went into the house. While
she was gone, the two freshmen drove off in her car.
A certain high official in Encina Club was being
entertained at the Tri-Delt house for Sunday night
supper. During the course of the evening some gentle
man phoned and told the little lady who answered:
"Please tell Mr. to hurry to the San Mateo Hos
pital. His wife has just had an eight-pound baby."
One story that the campus correspondent over
looked, however, concerns the little rascals at the Theta
Xi house. Despairing of ever completely evolving a
satisfactory philosophy of life, and oppressed by the
breakdown of medieval faith in attempting to solve
the complexities of contemporary society, and gen
erally overburdened by the soul-deadening encroach
ment of an omnipresent ennui, the gentlemen of Theta
Xi dressed up a dummy one evening.
The saturation point was finally reached when it
was unable to tell the dummy from a Theta Xi. With
ennui and despair still encroaching, and for lack of
anything better to do, they then proceeded to lay the
dummy prostrate in the street and wait for develop
ments.
A car came swinging around the corner. There was
a screech of brakes, but, alas, too late! The dummy
was cleft in twain. The car came to a halt and two
women got out and rushed hysterically to pick up the
injured member in both hands. Then they found thd
they had only knocked the stuffing out of him.
The Theta Xis tittered in the bushes. But they
tittered not when before the magistrates of the Men's
Council they appeared. "I grant you your privilege
of working out your social destinies, full liberty of
speech, and freedom of the press," said the chairman
through his long, flowing beard, "but why did you have
to pull that stunt on Mrs. Hoover?"
