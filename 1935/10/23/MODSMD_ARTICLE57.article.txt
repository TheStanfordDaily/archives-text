## HARVARD OF THE WEST 
### 
Always hard to stomach ... is a Big Game defeat,
when it must be admitted that California is superior
to Stanford in the realm of football . . . but just
Iwice as distateful is to concede that ihe home of the
Golden Bear outclasses the Farm in respect to schol
arly eminence.

The little red frosh bible announces that it is a
traditional belief that Stanford is in every way su
perior to California. Something of a similar nature
has prevailed in the minds of western citizens for
about three decades. "Stanford is the Harvard of the
West!" We heard it even before we took the aptitude
test. Because it is traditional, we still hear it from
various sources. But how long can tradition bear up
under the repeated public assertions by educational
authorities that California unquestionably offers supe
rior facilities for learning than does Stanford?

One of the most recent appraisals of American uni
versities listed the top ten as follows: Harvard, Chi
cago, Columbia, California, Yale, Michigan, Cornell,
Princeton, Johns Hopkins, Wisconsin, Minnesota. Stan
ford was placed in a five-way tie for eleventh.

Now these rankings were made by a man whose
opinion on educational subjects is generally respected.
They were made after a study of distinguished fac
ulty members, scientific journals, and the ratings of
several committees and individuals. Though not neces
sarily acceptable as completely authoritative, they are
not to be sneered at.

To admit that certain eastern universities rank
higher than Stanford is reconcilable. But to be told
that the educational factory at Berkeley, of all places,
is gaining the national reputation of being the leader
in the West is something to raise the fightin' blood of
faculty and student body alike. Stanford selects its
students more carefully than does Chl, its classes have
the advantage of being smaller, its professors are just
as well educated, and its courses of study are just as
comprehensive. The reasons why Cal is beating Stan
ford out of its place of eminence are hard to find.
Unfortunately the students can do little toward
retaining Stanford's reputation for being the Harvard
of the West. It seems to be up <o the Board of Trus
tees, Ihe administration, and the faculty. They are the
ones who in this case must bear the burden of "Beat
ing the Bears." â€”John McClelland
