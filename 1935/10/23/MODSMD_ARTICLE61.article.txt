# MAD MEN OF '39

The Editor, Sir:
Is every college test a mad-house
or is it just the childish Thirty-
Niners who haven't learned yet how
to think of anyone but themselves
that makes it seem so?
I refer specifically to the abom
inable manners shown at the Eng
lish A exam Monday night. Stamp
ing, howling, hissing, booing, and

j whistling may be fun in itself and
| may have its place, but in my opin
! ion its place is not in an examination
; room.
Even though you might not guess
it, some of the freshmen are inter
ested in passing the exam, and I for
one will feel that if I have failed that
j test I am not entirely to blame,
i I'm really not a prude, but after
j all!
