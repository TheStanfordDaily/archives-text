•TWO FOR TONIGHT"
AC the Fox-Stanford
BThat after three years Bing
Crosby still remains the
world's No. 1 crooner is
largely due to just such pic
tures as "Two for Tonight." As in
most Crosby films, his songs are all
important. The best of five good
ones are "I Wish I Were Aladdin"
and Without a Word of Warning."
Bing is cast in a pleasant comedy
role at which he is reasonably adept.
Mary Boland, his mother, flutters
about routinely, suffering from the
lack of Charlie Ruggles. Though
this is a comedy, no one let Joan
Bennett in on the secret. As a re
sult, she is the only one who plays
her part straight, and it makes her
look just a bit silly.
Funniest character is an uniden
tified loon who plays tit-tat-toe with
himself, squirts seltzer water from
a syringe bottle into Bing Crosby's
face. —Botsford
