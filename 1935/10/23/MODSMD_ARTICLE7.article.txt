# British Call To Mussolini To End War
## Hoare Strikes Definite Conciliatory Note In Peace Plea 
### 
LONDON, Oct. 22 (A 3 ). —A new
British peace call to Premier Mus
solini was sounded in the House
of Commons today when Parlia
ment began a three-day debate
upon the dissolution and the na
tional elections November 14.
Striking a definite conciliatory
note, Sir Samuel Hoare, foreign
secretary, summed up the Italo-
Ethiopian situation with assurances
that sanctions to he taken against
Italy were economic and not mili
tary.
He pleaded that there is still time
to work out an honorable and ac
ceptable African peace agreement.
Policies Opposed
Hoare's .speech caused vigorous
opposition attacks upon government
policies, led by Major Clement
Richard Atlee, Laborite, and Sir
Herbert Samuel, Liberal, which
furnished a keynote for the elec
tion, expected to be fought out
largely on international issues.
Reaffirming British friendship for
Italy, Hoare declared there was no
quarrel with Fascism, noted Italy is
still a member of the League and
said there was still "a breathing
spell left before the application of
economic pressure begins."
"Cannot this eleventh hour
change be so used as to make it
unnecessary to 'proceed with
economic action against a fellow
member, an old friend and a
former ally?" he asked.
The session began with Hoare's
declaration that the League is one
of the greatest institutions mankind
ever attempted to build.
He expressed belief that League
economic pressure decided upon
against Italy would "definitely
shorten the duration of war."
Denies Rumors
Of military sanctions, he said a
collective agreement at Geneva,
which is a prerequisite for the en
forcement, of such sanctions, "has
never existed and such measures,
therefore, have never formed any
part of our policy."
Expressing disbelief that anyone
in Europe wants war, Sir Samuel
said "How unscrupulous, in view of
these facts, that propagandists hold
us up as war mongers who are de
termined to plunge the world into a
general conflagration."
