ROME, Oct. 2.'{ (/P).â€”New hope for peace iii Europe and Africa, based
on an Italo-British understanding quarters. Official sources indicated
Italy's contribution to the cause of peace in Europe, aside from her will
ingness to talk about the Ethiopian question, quite likely would be with-

drawal of one division of her troops
from her African colony of Libya.
At the same time a government
spokesman commented with un
concealed optimism on what he
termed "unconfirmed reports"
that Britain contemplates with
drawal of four big warships from
the Mediterranean.
If that is true, he added, it is en
tirely possible Italy will "study pos
sibility" of reducing the strength of
her reinforced Libyan garrison on
the border of Egypt.
