# 'Elocution Contest' Won by Grove Day
## 
### DAVE BOTSFORD 
To the hard, cold tune of $5 in
cash, Grove Day last night carried
away first prize from Sword and
Sandals' old-time "elocution con
test." But neither hard nor cold was
interpretation of the "Elocution
Teachers' Nightmare," a composite
poem which gained its humor from
the piecing together of inappropriate
lines from famed poets' works.
Judge George Culver, Mrs. B. Q.
Morgan, and Thomas Barclay
awarded Sydney Head second place
for his priceless '"Osier Joe, - ' tale of
a lad's undying love for his erring
wife.
Along the line of last season's
''Drunkard" revival, "dramatic'
readings of other days were recited
with all the "emotional'' fervor and
intensity their famous authors in
tended.
High humor note of the evening
was struck by Dick Dawson when
he attempted to give the sad. sad

"Blacksmith's Story." Twice he for
got his lines, but so loud were the
audience's laughs at his pseudo
serious facial antics that the poor
fellow couldn't hear his prompters.
So twice he solemnly walked .iff and
on the stage and gulped water from
a huge pitcher on the speaker's
table.
Though the main point of the
"contest" was laughs, every speaker
at some time during his piece hushed
the audience to pin-dropping c ilenc '
by a bit of really excellent vocal
expression.
Of the six "artists," Frank O'Neill,
George Wood, Sydney Head, Joe
Lawry, Dick Dawson, and Grove
Day, not one failed to win his hear
ers' acclaim. Typical of the entire
audience's reaction, Dr. Hay Lyman
Wilbur ended the evening with:
"While I didn't shed many tears, I
certainly enjoyed the whole pro
gram."
