# Parade To Climax Pep Drive As Team Leaves
## Team To Be Escorted To Depot Today Students To Gather Near Fiji House at 3:30 O'clock Today 
### Herb Diamond 
With spirited yells and plenty of
sideline chatter, Stanford rooters
attending yesterday's football prac
tice demonstrated their whole
hearted support of Tiny Thornhill
and his Indian gridders.
Enthusiasm ran high as the Big
Red Machine went through a
scrimmage session with Murray
Cuddehack's "Washington Hus
kies." Cuddeback, who is Stan
ford's chief scout, returned only
Monday, from Washington. Since
then he has been drilling his Farm
edition of the "Huskies," using the
Northerners' formations and tac
tics. Thus Students' Day on the

practice gridiron was made all the
more realistic when the Indians
ran through some authentic Wash
ington formations.
While Yell Leader Dick Stark and
his two junior assistants, Talbot
Shelton and Web Jones, were not di
recting festivities, Claude Callaway,
varsity tackle of last year, encour
aged rooters in a brief but fiery talk.
His words increased the "Halt the
Huskies" sentiment that was already
much in evidence.
Completed are the plans of the
Cardinals committee for today's tre
mendous rally which culminates the
pep drive. At 3:30 o'clock this after
noon rooters will gather on Lasuen
Street in front of the Fiji house to
stage a parade which will find its
way down Palm Drive to the Palo
Alto railroad station.
Members of the band are re
quested to meet at the Fiji house at
fullback and captain of the 1!)2K
3:15 o'clock, announces Stark.
The Big Red Machine is sched
uled to roll out of Palo Alto at 4:26
o'clock on a special train bound for
Seattle.
Speakers who may appear, al
though no definite word has been
received from them, include Jim
Triolo, last year's yell leader;
John Bunn, head basketball coach;
and BifT Hoffman, former ace

Indian varsity.
With the squad, Asta the Turtle,
having fully recovered from her re
cent illness, will make the trek to
' Washington. Also with the squad
j will go the sentiment of the Stanford
j student body, to a man —that senti
j nient isn't a silent hope, it shouts,
i "Wax Washington!"

While Yell Leader Dick Stark and
his two junior assistants, Talbot
Shelton and Web Jones, were not di
recting festivities, Claude Callaway,
varsity tackle of last year, encour
aged rooters in a brief but fiery talk.
His words increased the "Halt the
Huskies" sentiment that was already
much in evidence.
Completed are the plans of the
Cardinals committee for today's tre
mendous rally which culminates the
pep drive. At 3:30 o'clock this after
noon rooters will gather on Lasuen
Street in front of the Fiji house to
stage a parade which will find its
way down Palm Drive to the Palo
Alto railroad station.
Members of the band are re
quested to meet at the Fiji house at
fullback and captain of the 1!)2K
3:15 o'clock, announces Stark.
The Big Red Machine is sched

o'clock on a special train bound for

Speakers who may appear, al
though no definite word has been
received from them, include Jim
Triolo, last year's yell leader;
John Bunn, head basketball coach;
and BifT Hoffman, former ace

Indian varsity.
With the squad, Asta the Turtle,

j nient isn't a silent hope, it shouts,
i "Wax Washington!"
