# B.A.C. Urges Ducat Buying In Last Drive
## 
### 
From the B.A.C. ticket office
comes a plea to Stanford stu
dents. Little more than 200
rooters' tickets for the U.S.C.
game have been purchased
during the two days those du
cats have been on sale.
Until the size of the rooting
section is ascertained none of
the surrounding seats can be
offered for sale. The B.A.C.
last night offered its belief that
the small sale thus far is not a
forecast of student disinterest,
merely of negligence in pur
chasing the tickets early.
Today is the last scheduled
day of sale. "Get it today,"
asks the BA..C.
