SEATTLE, Oct. 23 (Special to The
Daily).—Victory-drunk Washington
cradled its aching head in hands to
day and fought to make itself con
scious of persistent warning that
danger lies ahead.
A woeful condition exists on the
University of Washington campus
today. Still celebrating last week's
24-0 triumph over Washington
State, a confident student body
kindly anticipates victory Satur
day.
Out on the practice field Coach
Phelan's Huskies, tired after last
week end's affair but in perfect con
dition, are constantly reminding
themselves of last year's 24-0 deba
cle by Stanford.
At the first practice of the week
Phelan spoke these words to his
men: "Stanford has the most pow
erful team on the coast. They will
be lots tougher than the Cougars.
Forget about the Cougars, but by
all means don't forget that 24-0."
Monday was a well deserved rest
day for the Huskies. Tuesday they
went through an extensive blocking
and tackling drill and last night
Phelan put his men through of
fensive and defensive drill against
Stanford formations.
Last night it was indicated that
j the same starting team against
W.S.C. will open Saturday, with
one exception—Jack MacKcnzie,
! who distinguished himself in the
latter part of the W.S.C. affair,
will start at right tackle.
Friday night all Washington
; will turn out for a giant pep rally
and even at this early date the
I town seems to be reaching fever
heat. Officials expect a capacity
crowd of 40 thousand.
The weather predictions are "dry
i and cold" for Saturday but just in
j case of precipitation the field has
i been blanketed with tarpaulins to
I assure at least a drv kick-off.
