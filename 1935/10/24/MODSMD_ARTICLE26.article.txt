## KFRC Covers Game Tiny Makes No Changes In Line Positions 
### Bob Leland 
With the lusty cheers of several
( hundred students ringing in their
! ears, Tiny Thornhill and his charges
went through their final practice in
preparation for the all-important
| contest with Washington Saturday.
Nothing has been left undone
on the part of the team and
! coaches to "Halt the Huskies."
Last nigbt the team that will prob
ably start the Husky game ran
through signals and then worked
| on defense against Washington
j passes as thrown by Ernie Nevers
and the Greys.
The squad that will carry the bur
den Saturday will probably do so
! without the services of Bones Ham
ilton, who may be held out to spell
Bobby Grayson at fullback. The line
will be intact with Monk Moscrip,
Woody Adams, Wes Muller, Larry
Rouble, Bob Reynolds, Dale Beedlc,
1 and Keith Topping, while Bill Paul
man, Jimmy Coffis, and Joe Vigna
will probably be in the backfield
| with Grayson.

Thornhill named the following
34 players to make the trip north:
Adami>, Beedle, Black, Brandin, Cal
| laghan, CampbeU, Carlson, Coffis,
Collins, Cuneo, Dakan, Grant, Gray
! son, Glenn Hamilton, "Bones"
! Hamilton, Larsen, Luckett, Mat
i thews, Madlem, Mangam, Moscrip,
Muller, Paulman, Reisner, Reynolds,
Rouble, Schott, Stone, Todd, Top
ping, Trompas, Tsoutsouvas, Vigna,
! and Williams.
Claude Callaway, varsity tackle
i b'st year, but on the disabled list.
| this season, just about hit the mark
when he said: "We aren't going way
up there to get beat!" And they
aren't.
