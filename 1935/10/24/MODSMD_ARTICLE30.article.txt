# Alustiza May Need Operation
## Doctors Find Indication Of Retinal Tear Blood Surrounding Injury Blurs Clear Sight Of Break in Eye 
### 
Frarikie Alustiza will very prob
ably need an operation upon his eye
before complete and correct vision
cun be assured. That opinion came
horn Doctors Hans Balkan and Gor
don Smith, who spent nearly an hour
yesterday peering into the rear of
Frank's injured optic.
They sighted what is believed to
be a retinal tear which, if it ex
ists, will necessitate an operation.
They couhl not, however, be posi
tive that such a tear exists be
cause the region surrounding the
injury was still in a hemorrhage
state and made observation of the
retinal surface difficult.
Another examination will be made
Sunday with the presupposition that
the blood engorging the injured re
gion will be completely diffused and
allow a perfect view of the retina.
At that time they will be able to
identify such a tear positively if it
exists.
At present Alustiza's vision is
almost normal. He can see objects
directly in front of the eye all
right but vision below the eye
level is hazy.
Between today and Sunday doc
tors are allowing him to be up and
around the hospital but not into the
direct sunlight outside. Mild phys
ical activity will do the injured ret
ina no harm.
