# Treasured Relics Placed in Museum

### ALLEN DRURY 
It is a long way from the Rancho
j San Lucas to Morocco, but from
i thus far apart come two new addi
! tions to the museum — an adobe
I brick from San Lucas and a small
1 collection of antique Berber and RifT
! pottery from Morocco.
According to Pedro de Lemos, di
! rector of the museum, the Rancho
; San Lucas, situated at San Lucas,
I Calif., is an interesting remnant of
I the days when Mexico ruled the
{state. Life continues on it much the
! same as it always has, the principal
; activities being cattle-raising and
sheep-raising. Several car-loads of
j iheep are sent each year to New
| York and Chicago. Mr. de Lemos
states that the brand used in brand
ing the cattle is the oldest in con
i tinuous use in California.
The rancho originally covered
an area of about 44,000 acres, but
has since been cut down to 15,000.
All buildings on it, including a
two-story barn, were built in
1870 of adobe brick, similar to that
which the museum now owns.
The present owner, Mr. de Lemos
says, has in his possession several
of the original grants of the rancho,
including two from the federal gov
ernment bearing the signature of
President Grant. It is hoped that
these and other relics of historic
value will eventually be acquired by
the museum.
The pottery exhibit, which con
■ tains examples of different types of
Moorish work, was added to the
museum during the summer quar
ter. It includes pottery fashioned
by the RifT and Berber tribes, the
latter being especially interesting

I because it shows the way in which
the work is decorated by "finger
i painting."
The "souk," or potter, places a dab
of pitch on the rim of the piece of
pottery and, using that as a palette,
f draws geometric diagrams and fig- 1
ures. The result of this method
looks much like that produced by
the American Indians, and like it,
' the designs have symbolical mean
ing, according to Mr. de Lemos.
