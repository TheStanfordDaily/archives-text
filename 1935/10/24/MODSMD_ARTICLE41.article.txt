# Water Poloists Meet S.C. Tomorrow
## Outstanding Tankmen To Vie On Farm Indians Hope To Stage Comeback in Quest For Honors 
### 
Two evenly rated water polo
squads will tangle at Encina Pools
when Coach Nort Thornton's Indian
varsity meets a cohort of Trojan
warriors tomorrow afternoon at 4:15
o'clock.
With a revised line-up and a
highly polished offense, (he Cardi
nals hope to stage a come-back in
their quest for Coast honors. They
won't easily forget the stinging
defeat they received last week at
the hands of the California Hears
and tomorrow they will he out
for revenge. The starting line-up,
says Thornton, will he announced
at game time.
Captain John Paulsen and Gordon
Warner, ace forwards from Troy,
wili lead an aggressive outfit that
should give the Farm men no little
amount of trouble. Students' ad
mission to the game will be lÂ£j cents
with student body card, others will
be required to pay 50 cents.
The Stanford team will take on an
unknown quantity called the Olym
pic Club in a game scheduled for
Saturday afternoon. As was pre
viously pointed out, the Cardinals
seem to be in for a sound beating,
since the Olympians lost to the Ber
keley squad by a single point,
whereas Stanford was downed 8-2
by the Bears. The only redeeming
factor in the Indians' favor is the
fact that they defeated the Athens
Club 3-1 and 5-3 in successive tilts
while the Olympians were downed
by the Athenians.
As a preliminary feature to Sat
urday's game, a Stanford quintet
of the fastest dash men who ever
churned the waters of Encina
Pools \yill get under way at 3:15
o'clock in an official attempt to
better the American 50-meter
record of 27.2 held by Pan Keo
loha of Honolulu. Henry God
man. Jack Vibert, Alec MacKen
zie, Bill Lhamon, and Larry
Pringle are the mermen who will
perform under the eyes of A.A.U.
