THE LAST YELL—
THIS AFTERNOON
This afternoon is Stanford's last
chance. When the Cascade Limited
pulls out of the Palo Alto station at
4:26 o'clock today. Stanford sup
porters will have finished their job.
So far it has been a mighty good
one. Where on Monday the Stan
ford red was pale, today it is back
to super brilliance. Stanford has
decided not to lose.
Today everything will be over as
far as B'arm fans are concerned. The
last mighty yell and song will go up
today. Then Stanford will wait till
Saturday to see results of the job
done.
Let no doubt remain as to the
thoroughness of that job. Be at the
station today, let them know that
they can't lose.
HUSKY REVENGE
MUST STOP
Washingtonians have demon
strated some dogged determination
on the football field lately—they've
been seeking, and so far, getting,
revenge. Saturday that move of
vengeance must stop.
Back in 1933 the Huskies came
south, took a 33-0 beating at the
hands of California's Bears and
went back to Seattle vowing that
they'd get Cal next time. They did.
Last year Jimmy Phelan's lads
whipped the Bears 13-7 on north
ern territory.
They've been making similar vows
about Stanford. Last season they
came to the Farm undefeated to col
lect a 24-0 trouncing, their only real
loss of the year. (They tied W.S.C.
0-0). And now that Stanford is
coming up there, they figure to re
peat the California affair.
SWIM RECORDS
MAY CRASH
But while all this action is going
on up north Stanford's water polo
ists and swimmers will keep things
moving back on the Farm. Saturday
afternoon Stanford's three ace mer
men will try for the American 50-
meter sprint record. Every indica
tion leads to the belief that they'll
crack the old mark.
That will be at 3:15 o'clock.
Just following the record attempts
Coach Nort Thornton sends his
varsity water polo squad against
the Olympic Club. And tomorrow
afternoon they are slated to meet
