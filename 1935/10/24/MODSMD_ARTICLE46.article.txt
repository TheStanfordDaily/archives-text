# Frosh Team Drills For Bulldog Clash
## 
### 
Under the arc lights late yester- !
day, Jimmy Bradshaw and his as
sistants kept their Card frosh foot
ball squad at work. Determined to j
cure their charges of mistakes made 1
in last week's Trobabe game, the
yearling coaches put the '39 gridders j
through some real scrimmage.
Specializing on two new plays, j
the frosh worked on smoothing
out their haekficld and getting
more blocking in the line. Pete
Zagar pulled out of his tackle po
sition to lead interference, with
Pete Fay and Wally DeWitt slant
ing off tackle and around the
ends.
The Papooses' worst error in the
U.S.C. game was failure to help ball j
carriers with effective downfield j
blocking. Bradshaw says his eleven |
can't afford to repeat this mistake •
against San Mateo Junior College ;
Saturday, nor against California :
frosh two weeks from now.

Pete Fay looked good again
yesterday. With Zagar clearing j
the way for him, opposing taek
lers will have trouble bringing j
the slippery but hard-driving San
Franciscan down.
Facing a defensive outfit composed
mostly of second-string men, but in- |
eluding a few third stringers and
Dave Carnahan, regular tackle, the (
first team staged a steady touch- i
down march yesterday.
Byron West played right tackle in
place of Carnahan yesterday, and
has a good chance of starting against
San Mateo. Otherwise, the line-up
v/as the same as it has been all week.
Walt Hege's ankle is greatly im
proved, and may allow him to start
at end Saturday in place of Andy
Stojkovieh or Don Butler. Louis
Veenker, Al Alustiza, and Henry
Glasser worked out yesterday at
right half, replacing Bill Kirsch,
whose hip still bothers him.
