# On to Seattle — Halt the Huskies
## Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily The 						Fight for the Rose Bowl Is On Student Interest Has Helped Football Team Regain Its Old Self-Confidence 
### 
As Stanford prepares to climax a week of
whole-hearted football-consciousness with n
send-oll" that will voice the entire student
body's victory plea, Coach Claude E. Thorn
hill's Indian team leaves for Seattle this after
noon with a mental attitude that is unprece
dented since the U.S.C. game of 1933.
With the help of a student body that has
been sincerely behind them for the first time
since early in their days of prosperity, these
particular Indians, two years ago termed the
"sanest, most level-headed bunch of players
ever to gather on a Stanford team," have
passed as great a lest of spirit as any athletic
squad can be faced with.
Circumstances, begun by the U.C.L.A. de
bacle and continued by a merciless stream of
injuries, made the situation appear for a few
days as if Stanford were headed down the
toboggan.
That was the set-up until both the students
and team early Ibis week re-awakened to the
fact that Stanford had what onfpaper was "the
best team on the Pacific Coast," and that the
1935 season had just begun.
As evidenced by the squad's self-confidence,
a remnant of '31 and '33 that had remained
hidden during the early portion of the current
schedule, and by the spirit of 400 "Student
Day" rooters yesterday, Stanford again has
the same attitude, as the team that defeated

Washington 24 to 0 a year ago.
The Indians' spirit as they finished prepara
tions for the Huskies, greatest menace to their
whole season, show that they were thinking
of the real spirit of the famed "Stanford Vow."
This vow, made by Stanford's seniors three
years ago when they were freshmen, specifi
cally proclaimed that they would not lose to
! U.S.C. as long as they were in school. In effect,
! the vow seems destined to be fulfilled.
When those freshmen look that responsi
bility on their shoulders, however, the Tro
! Jans were the leading team on their schedule
j —the implication of the Stanford Vow, then,
| and the spirit in which it was made, were that
j the Indians would defeat the best teams on
; the Coast for three straight years.
Led through the disheartening past two
j weeks by Hobby Grayson and prodded by
j other team members who helped to make that
, vow and usher it safely through the first two
i years, the "spirit of '33" has been transmitted
j to the younger players, and the attitude of
the entire squad matches that shown by
U.C.L.A. when she invaded the Farm.
The Stanford and Washington teams have
similar mental attitudes concerning Satur
day's game. However,'the Huskies will have
the advantage of a spirited rooting section on
fhe sidelines; this can be counteracted only
i by a student send-ofl" today that the Indians
will remember during the game.

As Stanford prepares to climax a week of
whole-hearted football-consciousness with n
send-oll" that will voice the entire student
body's victory plea, Coach Claude E. Thorn
hill's Indian team leaves for Seattle this after
noon with a mental attitude that is unprece
dented since the U.S.C. game of 1933.
With the help of a student body that has
been sincerely behind them for the first time
since early in their days of prosperity, these
particular Indians, two years ago termed the
"sanest, most level-headed bunch of players
ever to gather on a Stanford team," have
passed as great a lest of spirit as any athletic
squad can be faced with.
Circumstances, begun by the U.C.L.A. de
bacle and continued by a merciless stream of
injuries, made the situation appear for a few
days as if Stanford were headed down the
toboggan.
That was the set-up until both the students
and team early Ibis week re-awakened to the
fact that Stanford had what onfpaper was "the
best team on the Pacific Coast," and that the
1935 season had just begun.
As evidenced by the squad's self-confidence,
a remnant of '31 and '33 that had remained
hidden during the early portion of the current
schedule, and by the spirit of 400 "Student
Day" rooters yesterday, Stanford again has
the same attitude, as the team that defeated

Washington 24 to 0 a year ago.
The Indians' spirit as they finished prepara
tions for the Huskies, greatest menace to their
whole season, show that they were thinking
of the real spirit of the famed "Stanford Vow."
This vow, made by Stanford's seniors three
years ago when they were freshmen, specifi
cally proclaimed that they would not lose to
! U.S.C. as long as they were in school. In effect,
! the vow seems destined to be fulfilled.
When those freshmen look that responsi
bility on their shoulders, however, the Tro
! Jans were the leading team on their schedule
j —the implication of the Stanford Vow, then,
| and the spirit in which it was made, were that
j the Indians would defeat the best teams on
; the Coast for three straight years.
Led through the disheartening past two
j weeks by Hobby Grayson and prodded by
j other team members who helped to make that
, vow and usher it safely through the first two
i years, the "spirit of '33" has been transmitted
j to the younger players, and the attitude of
the entire squad matches that shown by
U.C.L.A. when she invaded the Farm.
The Stanford and Washington teams have
similar mental attitudes concerning Satur
day's game. However,'the Huskies will have
the advantage of a spirited rooting section on
fhe sidelines; this can be counteracted only
i by a student send-ofl" today that the Indians
will remember during the game.
