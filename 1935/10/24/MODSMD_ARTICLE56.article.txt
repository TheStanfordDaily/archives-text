Fox Washington!
In answer to all this "Halt the Huskies' 'and "Wax
Washington" propaganda, we hear the mudhsns up
Nawth are saying: "We've got a Phelan you're phoolin'."
Fox Washington!
Flushed with the success of their rooters' cap boy
cott, Rally Committeemen are planning to picket the
U.C.L.A. football team for being unfair to Stanford
students. If the Rally Committee will only wait until
after syllabus fees come out they can carry their
pretty sandwich boards in front of the Ad building.
Fox Washington!
Fox Washington!
This afternoon's rally should be a success. But
some of those nasty old newspapermen from the City
suggest lhat the Rally Committee should build a Big
Game bonfire—under the team.
Fox Washington!
It is my casual observation, however, that the pur
pose of the football team is to play football, and not to
provide employment for sports writers and humor
columnists. From his observation tower in Wong's
Kitch, Our Hasher learns the following: "Footb ill boy
good boy. Hashboy allee time bum. Football boy
make um good boy for rushee. Hashboy allee time
smoke. Talk too much. Drinkum too much. Bum.
Roble girl allee time terrific."
Fox Washington!
Busky!
The Husky!
In the Tuskyl

Husky Wee-Wee
In other words, the Huskies are all tuckered out.
