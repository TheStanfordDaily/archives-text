## DISSECTING A SACRED COW 
### 
With significant unanimity, Stanford professors
agree that grades mean nothing, that ex's are indica
tive not of learning, but of our efficiency at mental
stuffing, a process not strange to many ten-year-olds.
They triennially console the 10 or 15 per cent of us
mathematically destined to flunk by pointing out that
letter grades and dispassionate groupings do not
represent their personal evaluation of our ability. That
reassurance is the silver lining of the academic cloud.
But to those of us who are experts at treading the
scholastic mill, it is small. consolation. For we know
that it is not the professor's regard, but the inexorable
and impersonal grading machine that gives us our
official ratings and brands some of us as dumb bells
by complete disqualification.

It is this knowledge that keeps us from regard
ing ex's in the debonair manner professors hope for.
This is the reason for the mind-gripping panic, ihc
terrible and hurried cranial ransacking for elusive
fact when we are faced with a command to "spill."
And this knowledge also constitutes justification for
our sly glances at our neighbor's paper, our sneaking
little search for the key-word that will open another
vital cell of knowledge.
Officially, such peeking is a violation of the Honor
Code. But can any magna charta of scholastic verity
bind us to honesty? Would we, moreover, be quite
the reasonable men and women the Honor Code, itself,
tries to make us, if we did not violate it?
$ * * Jj:
In the last analysis, the Code ofiers us only a private
feeling of self-satisfaction, not redeemable for grade
points, in place of the indicative letter by which uni
versity, family, and friends judge us.
In the face of the Code's holiness, buttressed by
both student and faculty approval, this is rank heresy.
But considering the cheating business from a purely
practical point of view, isn t it natural that wo should
employ any method to get those all-important letters?
Isn't it perfectly logical that so long as vital evalua
tions come from vital ex's, we should slip a few illegal
aces into our mental deck of cards?

Alls fair in love and war. And this business of
learning is a war, surely. True, it wouldn't be if our
actual stock of knowledge was the official criterion.
But it isn t. The letter grades, the precise and inevi
table percentages, constitute the official evaluation of
our education. We have to fight two enemies to get
them: an impersonal system and our natural inability
to turn on the mental faucet on a certain hour of a
certain day.
Considering the professor's denial of the examina
tion s accuracy as intellectual litmus paper, consider
ing the importance of letter grades, considering the
trickery bald questions can play on us, why shouldn't
we cheat? â€”Bob Eisenbach
