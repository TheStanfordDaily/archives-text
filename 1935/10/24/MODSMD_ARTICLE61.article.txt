# NOT SO NICE HERE

The Editor, Sir:
For some reason when I trans
ferred from U.C. to Stanford, I
thought that I was emerging from
the dark into the warm and friendly
glow of an enlightened university.
You see, echoes from your some
what redundant editorials, talks, and
braggings concerning your so-called
"Honor System" have been heard
even on the Berkeley campus.
Being a graduate student with a
library "stack permit"—that privi
lege obtained after signing one's
life away—l thought that I would be
entitled to withdraw any volume in
the stacks for which I might have
need.
But oh no! All bound periodicals,
I abruptly learned, were never to be
taken from the library. And why
was this rule made? Because so
many volumes had been stolen in
the past.
In the library at California any
graduate has free access to the stacks,
and they have the idea there that
the books are to be used, so they let
Ihe kids use them—all and any of
(hem. And California has no "Honor
System," probably because they
don't need it.
To my knowledge (and I have at
tended four colleges) there is no
university that places so many bar
riers in the way of a student doing
library research.
