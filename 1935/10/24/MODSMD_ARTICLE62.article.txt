The Editor, Sir:
It was made clear to me today that
the unfortunate transfer who comes
to Stanford with less than 90 units is
subject to more injustice than first
appear when he is placed in Encina
and classed as a mere freshman.
I myself was one of these unfortu
nates and, although I had a total of
63 units and felt old enough to re
frain from breaking things for the
adolescent joy of it, I was charged
the usual breakage fee of $10. Al
though I lived in the hall only two
quarters I received the same break
age refunds as others, $2.35.
I grant that it would be imprac
tical to charge less breakage fees to
older students and transfers on the
ground that they should know bet

ter, but I feel that little difficulty
would be experienced in apportion
ing refunds more equitably when the
victim lived at Encina less than the
usual three quarters.
I understand that students who
lived there only one quarter are sub
jected to the same injustice . . .
There is something which changes a
student's feeling toward Stanford
when he is charged the same fee re
gardless of the number of quarters.
