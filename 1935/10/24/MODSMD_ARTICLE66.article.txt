# DIANA'S DIARY
## 
### THE CO-ED SHOPPER 
October 24
Dear Diary: I just had a marvel
ous U.C. week-end and should feel
quite a traitor. I spent it at Jean's
home in Piedmont and attributed
much of its success to a very nice
blond brother. Her mother's a dear,
and to thank her for the visit I
placed an order at the FLOWER
SHOP, 175 University, for them to
telegraph flowers to her. Then I
discovered some adorable fifty-cent
note paper in bright boxes at
WIGHTMAN'S, 366 University, for
the thank-you-note. I practically
lived in my new green wool outfit
during my stay—it went to football
games and cocktail parties with
equal smartness. It is a one-piece
dress trimmed in quilting with a
short jacket that sports mink at the
collar and pockets. I got it at MARY
ELIZABETH'S, 119 University,
where I found the hat, an unusual
brown felt with a perky brim that
slants over one eye. Brown kid
gloves from MARIAN SEIMAS,
534 Ramona, completed the cos
tume. I also got fabric gloves there

j for the Quad —they're in brown,
black, and navy for a dollar. Ducky
j is really the only word for them—
referring to those new rainbow eve
' ning sandals at the WALK-OVER,
220 University. They're striped
moire with cut-out toe, go with
any color and are divine with white.
Il looks as if I won't flunk English
lit after all. The ASSOCIATED
: STENOGRAPHERS—their new of
i fice is 443 Bryant—have done nobly
by my punctuation and of course,
their typing is super. Ted has for
| given my California digression of
; last week-end and has asked me to
jgo dancing tonight in the city. So
I'm off now to LYDIA'S, 460 Uni
versity. I'm so glad she lets Stan
ford gals charge because I'm feel-
I irig the end-of-the-month pinch and
do need one of her shampoos
(they're really scalp treatments)
and swell waves. All for seventy
five cents, too. I mustn't forget to
rave about Lentheric's new perfume.
It's Gardenia de Tahiti and smells
like the real thing. It's at the UNI
VERSITY PHARMACY, 134 Uni
versity.
