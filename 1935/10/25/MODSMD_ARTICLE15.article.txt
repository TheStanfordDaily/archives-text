SHANGHAI, Oct. 24 (/P>. â€”"What
was described as an insult in a
shrine to the Japanese flag by a
sailor of the United States Navy at
Tsingtao, China, was reported by the
Rengo (Japanese) news agency to
day to have aroused high feeling in
the Japanese community there.
(Although no report of the inci
dent had been received in Washing
ton, a naval officer who recently
came from China said, "If that re
port is true it may be serious.
("That shrine is one of the most
sacred the Japanese have. I hope
there is nothing to it."
(Six submarines of the American
Navy, the submarine tender Cano
pus, and the submarine rescue ves
sel Pigeon are at Tsingtao, under
the charge of Commander Sherwood
Picking.)
Japanese consular authorities have
demanded apologies from the cap
tain of the war vessel to which the
seaman is attached, it was said.
Neither the name of the vessel nor
that of the saiior was disclosed.
