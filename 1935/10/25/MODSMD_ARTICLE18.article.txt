# Rifle Club Practice Held In Ad Building
## 
### DAVE BOTSFORD 
A volley of muffled shots .rings
out. Perhaps some Rough has taken
it out on Dr. Wilbur. More shots.
But no, they're from the cellar.
What's going on down there, any
way? Certainly the Administration
building is no placc for a shooting
gallery.
Frosh who suffer such reactions
while studying in the lobby of the
Administration building can quiet
themselves with the information
that a "shooting gallery" is just ex
actly what there is in the Ad build
ing basement.
Not connected with the R.0.T.C.,
the Stanford Rifle Club was or
ganized by rifle and pistol en
thusiasts in 1027 and outfitted
jointly by the Army and the mem
bers themselves. Members of the
club have been taking pot shots
at national match targets ever
since.
The indoor range is equipped with
twelve 50-yard maximum-ranged
targets and a small armory of pis
tols and rifles donated to the club.
Krgular shooting nighls are main

| tained under the guidance of Jim
Culver, Bait Snyder, and E. C. Tay
lor, who .show novices the various
techniques of shooting a gun. For
, instance, good shots "squeeze" rath
er than "pull" the trigger.
For long-range shooting, club
members use the 1000-yard range
of the Palo Alto Rod and Gun
Club located in the fields across
from the Ryan laboratory. Here
a special range is maintained for
scoring accuracy with the small
bore rifle.
Planned by the club for next
spring are two complete prize
matches open to all university stu
dents. Winners of these prize shoots
in the past have developed into na
tional champions. At present, how
| ever, only members of the club can
! shoot <in the ranges.
The Stanford club, affiliated with
the National Hifle Association, is
anxious to make members of all
students interested in gunnery. Five
women members are now develop
ing into excellent gunners, so the
masculinity of the club's purpose
' -should stop no woman.
