"We arc not going up to Wash
ington to get beat!" shouted Bones
Hamilton, Bobby Grayson, and Wes
Muller at the station rally yester
day afternoon. "The attitude of the
students during the past days has
put us in fighting mettle," was the
opinion of the three, speaking for
the team.
Not one of the thousand or more
students that milled about the
platform could doubt the sin
cerity of those words. They sang
and cheered the speakers, and
then as the train pulled out they
added a final chorus of "Come
Join the Band" for good measure.
This season the Uclan defeat
taught them that none of the former
laughing tactics would carry them
through all opposition. Now they
are serious—fighting mad. They
realize that "Wax Washington" is a
challenge. A challenge to them —to
Stanford, and they have accepted it.
Such enthusiastic cheering
could not help hut have its effect
on the team. They were grimly
determined to win as they climbed
aboard the train.
The die is cast —nothing remains
but to play the game. Regardless of
how it comes out, the student body
can rest assured that the Indians will
go down fighting, but it will take
super football by Washington to ac
complish such a feat.
Bobby Grayson sounded the battle
cry. "You've heard that Stanford
has a chance Saturday," he cried.
"That is only half the story; we're
going to win!"
The fight for the Rose Bowl is on!
