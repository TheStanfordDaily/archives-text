# One Fascist Division Leaves Libya
## 
### 
ROME, Oct. 24 (TP). â€”Italy threw
the responsibility for reinforcing
European peace in Great Britain's
lap tonight by announcing the in
dependent withdrawal of one di
vision of her troops in Libya.
A government spokesman dis
closed Premier Mussolini's decision
with visible pride in the belief that
it represents "a major contribution
to the solution of the problem of
peace, not only in Europe but also
in East Africa."
Italy emphasized the reduction
was being undertaken without any
reference to a decrease in Britain's
naval strength in the Mediterranean.
The concentration of Fascist troops
in Libya had been interpreted by
London as a threat to Egypt.
Simultaneously, in a way which
indicated the order was not an idle
gesture, the steamship Sannio, ca
pable of transporting 2,000 men,
sailed from Naples for Libya to take
away the first contingent of approxi
mately 15,000 troops involved in the
withdrawal order.
How many men will be left behind
patrolling the border of Libya was
not disclosed. Unofficial informa
tion, however, places the strength of
the present Libyan garrison at 80.000
Italian and native troops.
