## Grayson, Hamilton, and Moscrip Are Ready; Coffis May Start 'Can't Lose' — Bobby Team Meets Oregon Men In Oakland 
### Gordy Frost 
ON BOARD CASCADE LIMITED
: EN ROUTE TO SEATTLE, October
24 (Special to The Daily).—"After
i that rally we can't lose."
Bobby Grayson spoke those
words this evening just after the
I Stanford car dropped Palo Al'o
behind, and as the train swept
toward Seattle for the crucial
Stanford - Washington game Sat
| urduy, the 32 other Indian travel
ers thought, if they did not say,

There's a spirit running through
these Stanford Pullmans tonight
I that is determined, forceful, but not

Gordy Frost, sports editor of
The Daily, who left for Se
attle with the Indian football
team yesterday, will furnish
complete coverage of Satur
day's Washuigton - Stanford
game.
Co-operation by the B.A.C.
made it possible for Frost to
travel on the team car to se
cure first-hand coverage of the
game and the effects on the
team of the Daily - backcd
"victory drive."

! loud-spoken. Stanford can and will
! defeat Washington—that is that ap
i parent thought in every mind.
And a look at the team tonight
would lead one to believe that every
j man is in a condition to deliver.
, Grayson's injured ankle, though still
| somewhat sore, is strong enough to
| stand considerable strain. He be
lieves it will hold through the entire
i game tomorrow.
Bones Hamilton still has a tight
muscle but he's determined that
; it won't keep him from his best.
Tiny still plans to hold out Bones,
however, and perhaps use him later
in the game at fullback for Grayson.
In that case Jimmy Coffis and Joe
Vigna will start at the halves. Ham
ilton will be acting captain if he
starts.
Monk, Keith in Shape
Monk Moscrip still knows he has
that bad leg, but Monk isn't apt to
do much talking about injuries. He'll
start all right. So will his running
mate, Keith Topping, who sAys he
feels "great" despite a debate loss
last Sunday.
The others, Itill Paulman, Jim
Coffis, Joe Vigna, Wes Muller,
"Woody"' Adams, Larry Rouble,
Boh Reynolds, Dale Beedle — the
whole gang—are in perfect phys
ical shape.
Every Stanfordite on this train
lonight. is anxious to get a glimpse
at Washington's toted halfback. By
Haines. And from safety man Jim
my Coffis' talk it can be concluded
that Stanford's team won't take their
eyes off Mr. Haines Saturday after
noon, either.
Gel Grayson
Up north they're supposed to be
shouting "Get Grayson." But the
general opinion here tonight is that
Washington may have to do some
powerlul "getting" ig they expect to
stop Stanford's ail-American Satur
day.
The Indian trainload met a Uni
versity of Oregon squad, southward
bound for combat with U.C.L.A., at
Oakland tonight. Stanford warned
of the Bruin attack, and the Ore
gonians returned the favor with
some respectful comments concern*
ing the fast Husky backfield.

An inventor in Germany is re
ported to have devised a new hy
draulic transmission for automobiles
which arranges its own radio.

that Stanford's team won't take their
eyes off Mr. Haines Saturday after
noon, either.
