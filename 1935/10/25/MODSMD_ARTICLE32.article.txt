from a gale and forest and brush

California tonight planned immedi

the mad sweep of the flames.
Reseeding of the burned districts
and construction of additional debris
b. sins will be the principal features
of the protective program, said

County Forester.
At about G;5O a.m., as fire fighters
pressed their battle against the
flames, a distinct earthquake was
felt throughout most of Southern
California, but it was not strong
enough to cause any damage.
Apparently centered southeast of
Rivtisi.de, the shock was felt in.
Tin,. Beach and Los Angeles, and as
far south as San Diego.
In ths wake of the fire, potential
soil erosion and watershed damage
in the Rubio section to La Canada
sectcr, likely target for terrific flood
damage within a few months, was
estimated at $2,500,000 alone.
Roughly divided, the loss was esti
nutled at $3,500,000 in Los Angeles,
Ovan;;e, Riverside, and San Bernar
dino counties to citrus, walnut, and
ether agricultural crops; $3,000,000
to uirest acreage; $1,000,000 to resi
dences and mountain cabins de
stroyed in the path of the flames, and
at least $500,000 incidental damage
to oil wells, shipping and private
beats, automobiles, signboards, win
dows and awnings, street trees, and
highways.
