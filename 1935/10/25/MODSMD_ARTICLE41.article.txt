# 'U.S. Will Participate In '36 Olympics'-Brundage
## American Games Head Says Politics Cannot Interfere Olympic Games Belong To Athletes; Religion, Race Irrelevant 
### 
CHICAGO, Oct. 24 (/P). â€” The
United States positively will be
represented in the 1936 Olympic
Games, Avery Brundage of Chicago,
president of the American Olympic
Association and chairman of the
American Olympic Committee, said
today in a bristling statement in
reply to opponents of this coun
try's. participation in the games.
"The Olympic Games belong to
the athletes and not to the poli
ticians," his statement said.
"Knowing the temper of the true
sports leaders and of the amateur
athletes of this country who are
unanimous on this subject, I say
positively that there will be teams
representing the United States in
the 1930 games. The sportsmen
of this country will not tolerate
the use of clean American sport as
a vehicle to transplant Old World
hatreds to the United States.
"In accepting the invitation to
compete in the 1936 Olympic Games,
the American Olympic Committee,
like the Olympic committees of 48
other nations which have accepted,
does not endorse the policies of any
government. The committee consid
ered nothing but sport and its re
quirements.
Germany's political policy with
in or without its borders has no
hearing on the subject. The com
mittee only followed the universal
and unbroken Olympic precedent
of 40 years and ignored irrelevant
political, racial, and religious af
fairs.
Attempts to twist and distort the
unanimous decision of the commit
tee into an endorsement of the Nazi
policies are nothing but barefaced
effrontery."
