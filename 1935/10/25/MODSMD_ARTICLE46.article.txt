# Redskin Natural As Symbol of Stanford
## 
### MARGARET LOUD 
Indian seems such a natural sym
bol of Stanford that it is easy to
forget it has not been long in use.
The first to designate Stanford—or
; at least its football team —as Indians
| were the newspaper sports writers
and cartoonists. Their connection
of the two was based on sound foun
j dations, for Stanford is rich in In
| dian traditions, as the relics in the
\ museum prove.
Indian Background
As early as 1792, the Spanish ex
' plorer Anza, going from San Jose to
j San Francisco, spoke of the aston
ishing number of Indians he saw in
' these parts. Their burial mounds are
j all over the peninsula, and some of
the Stanford property is said to have
| been former "pow-wow" ground.
No symbol could be better for
I Stanford than Indian. We have an
Indian tomahawk in the Axe and
an Indian color in the Cardinal.
| Nearly all western universities ai'e
| represented by some animal, such
j as Bear or Cougar,, whose natural
conqueror is the Indian—we'll have
to forget about the Trojans. Redskin
! costumes and customs offer all sorts
of possibilities fov rallies — war
dances around the bonfire, for in
! stance.
