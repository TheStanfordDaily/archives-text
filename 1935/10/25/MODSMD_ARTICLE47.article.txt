# Axe Revives Interest
## 
### 
In 1923, an interested alumnus at
i tempted to institute the Indian as the
1 official symbol of the University.

Plans were made for an Indian
statue to- be placed at the open end
of the stadium, and Indian heads
were actually sewn on the football
blankets. Then student interest in
the Indian faltered; the statue was
, never built; the heads were removed
' from the blankets; and the Indian
; was apparently forgotten by all but
! the sports writers.
But our Indian was not destined
Ito die. Recovery of the Axe from
Cal aroused new interest in him.
The addition of an Indian war drum,
guarded by the Scalpers, and a
"Scalp" chant strengthened his hold.
Finally, on November 25, 1930, by a
resolution of the Ex Committee, he
I became the official University sym
' bol; as such, the Stanford Indian
i lives on.
