# Indian Frosh Prepare For Jaysee Tilt
## 
### 
Defense against San Mateo Jaysee
plays was emphasized in flush foot
ball practice yesterday, as Coach
Jimmy Bradshaw ran his charges
through another scrimmage in
preparation for the Bulldog game
tomorrow.
With a victory over Marin Jun
ior College last week, and close
defeats by the St. Mary's and Cali
fornia frosh in their record, the
Bulldogs present a serious threat
to the Card frosh. San Mateo's
kicking is also strong, and Coach
Murius MacFadden's jaysees are
always hard to beat. The Gael and
Bear yearlings conquered the
Bulldogs only on intercepted pass
es, after hard battles.
Bradshaw will use the San Mateo
game as an experiment, if he can
afford it, in an effort to find his
strongest line-up for the California
game November 9.
The frosh will taper off a week
of scrimmage with signal drill
and running this afternoon. The
game will start at 2:30 o'clock to
morrow oil the San Mateo High
School field.
Stanford's probable starting line
tip includes Don Butler and Andy
Stojkovich, ends; Dave Carnahan
and Pete Zagar, tackles; Frank Mc-
Millan and Fred Gustafson, guards;
Dick Sutton, center; Ed Gamier,
quarterback; Pete Fay and Bill
Kirsch, halfbacks; and Wally de-
Witt, fullback.
