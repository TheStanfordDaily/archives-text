# Seattle Enthusiastic About Tomorrow's Indian, Husky Fray
## Washington Team in Top Condition but Odds Favor Stanford 
### WENDELL BROYLES 
Sports Editor, University of
Washington Daily
SEAT'I LE, Oct. 24 (Special to The
I Daily).—With Washington's pen
| nant destiny resting on the outcome
of Saturday's battle, eyes of all the
Northwest focused on Seattle as the
Huskies frisked through their final
workout.
The town has become aroused to
fever pitch over the importance of
the coming battle, especially the
university district where students
sure of victory have gone completely
wild.
Stanford Favored
A lost minute flourish of Califor
nia money swung the odds heavily
for Stantord. Already every one of
the 40,000 seats in the Washington
Stadium has been sold. All the
campus is ready for the mammoth
rally tonight.
Phelan secretly drove his team
through drill last night and plans
some time today to spirit his squad
away, not to return till game time.
There was a fear that Chuck Bond,
first-string tackle, would be lost to
the Huskies tomorrow. He was
stricken with a minor attack of ap
pendicitis as he worked out last
night.
Get New Plays
During the week Phelan has given
his team twelve new plays and a
new passing attack with which he
hopes to pierce the Stanford defense.
He worked especially with ends and
reserves, concentrating on speeding
up the line charging, in hopes of
halting the Indian backs before they
get started.
All week the Husky password has
been "Remember the 24-0." Last
year's situation is paralleled ex
actly as Phelan's men are still un
beaten, but no one dares mention
the Rose Bowl this time.
Every man is bent to revenge that
defeat of last season, the defeat that
wrecked a perfect Husky season.
The universal cry is "Get Grayson."
