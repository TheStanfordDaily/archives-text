# Stanford Soccer Squad Favored over San Jose
## 
### 
Whether Stanford's soccer squad
can beat San Jose Stiite tomorrow
depends a lot on the ability of the
forward wall to function well to
gether. This was the opinion ex
pressed yesterday by Coach Dick
Bullis as his team prepared for the
coming tussle at San Jose.
Although Bullis has been re
vamping the forward line this week
it still lacks the strength that he
would like to have them show. How
ever, the team as a whole has been
improving rapidly since its first
game that they dropped to San Ma
teo and last Saturday displayed real
strength by holding the strong S.F.U.
team to one penalty kick.
San Jose should be easy pick
ings, expressed Bullis, who ex
plained that although the Spartans
play a rugged game, they lack the
team work that his men have
been showing the past week. Re
ports from the southern city state
that their squad will display a fair
offense but will probably be very

weak on the defensive end of it.
In scrimmage this week the team
looked very good on defense and
with new men injected into the
line-up, showed fine scoring ability,
which thus far has been their main
difficulty. If they play against the
Spartans tomorrow morning as they
have this week they should hand
them a trimming.
The eleven men that will start for
Stanford are: Schaupp, Sawyer,
Weaver, Knecht, Colley, Curran,
Hall, Sloan, McCormick, Helms,
and Captain Barney Vierling.
