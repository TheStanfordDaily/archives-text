# Coast Leaders Face Upsets This Weekend
## California, Washington, U.C.L.A. Play Tomorrow 
### 
Washington, California, and U.C.
L.A., the three Coast leaders, all go
into conference games tomorrow,
and all have some chance of drop
ping out of the championship run
ning.
Washington, of course, takes on
Stanford in the higgest game. A
Husky win will give them only
Cal to defeat for the title and the
Rose Dowl. A Card win will put
the lied Car right back up in the
top bracket.
The Bears entertain Troy in Ber
keley. Troy's weak record for the ;
! past two years speaks not too highly
' of them, but Stub Allison still thinks
he'll get beat with a few breaks
against him.
Allison, however, is probably se- j
' cretly worrying more about his'
game with U.C.L.A. a week hence. {
In that battle another coast hope
will be eliminated from champion- I
ship running.
j Tliis week the Bruins play guest |
Jto Oregon in the Coleseum. The i
Westwood bunch is planning for a j
full GO minutes worth of action, for (
it was Oregon that held California ,
for all but two plays and lost 6-0 1
i two weeks ago.
U.C.L.A. Needs Wins
All U.C.L.A. has to do is to win !
her next two games, and she will be I
a cinch for all honors. But Oregon j
and Cal also planning to win.
W.S.C. and 0.5.C., both already j
defeated, meet in Portland in the \
last conference battle. Next week I
O.S.C. will take on the old rival. '
Oregon U., in the annual grudge en- j
counter.
Other games are St. Mary's-U.S.F. '
in Kezar on Sunday, Santa Clara- j
Portland (ex Columbia U.) at Kezar, j
and C.0.P.-Nevada in Reno.
