# Card Swimmers, Poloists Set For Big Week-End
## Tankmen Face Trojans Today, O. C. Tomorrow Sprint Swimmers, Divers, Water Poloists Starred At Encina Pools 
### 
Aquatic history should be made
tomorrow afternoon at Encina
Pools where a four-event swim
ming, diving, and water polo pro
gram is scheduled to begin at 3:15
o'clock.
As the major preliminary exhibi
tion to the varsity water polo till
with the strong Olympic Club, a
quintet of Stanford Weissmullers
will begin the day's festivities. Hen
ry Godman, Jack Vibert, Alec Mac-
Kenzie, and Bill Lhamon, of the
Indian varsity, and Larry Pringle,
sensational yearling sprinter, will
churn the waters in an official at
tempt to crack the American 50-
meter record of 27.8 seconds now
held by Hawaii's Paul Keoloha.
Record Breakers
All five of the men have been
consistently bettering the mark in
practice. At one time or another,
each has clipped at least two-tenths
of a second from Keoloha's time.
A.A.U. officials, with their trusty
stop-watches, will be on hand to
witness a probable record-break
ing dash. That at least one of
Coach Nort Thornton's hopes will
come through under fire is of
little doubt. Pringle and Godman,
who have both approached the
world's record, seem to be the men
favored to carry off honors.
Tom Boothe and Roy Winkelmann,
varsity and frosh stars, respectively,
will stage a diving exhibition. Pre
senting both single and formation
dives, they will perform from the
10-foot springboard and the 17 and
27-foot towers.
Frosh To Play
Frosh water poloists, in the third
of the day's events, face the hard
driving Olympic Club reserves. The
yearlings, although they lost by a
single point last, week, played a bril
liant game against the Bear Cubs
and, says Thornton, should give a
good account of themselves in to
morrow's tussle. Captain Johnny
Lamb and Dick Clarke, at the for
ward posts, backed up by Don
Towne, ace goalie, form a combina
tion that should give the Olympians
no end of trouble.
The program will wind up with
the Stanford varsity-Olympic Club
water polo melee. Past records give
the Indians an even break with the
Winged 'O' aggregation, but the
Cardinals will have to guard against
the slashing offensive drives of Ted
Wiget, Bob Foster, and Elmer Col
lette, all former Stanford greats.
New Team Starts
Coach Thornton will probably!
start his revised line-up wondering
whether the changes made in the
team this week will raise the Indian
morale from the low ebb it reached
during the second half of the Berke
ley battle.
Explanatory announcements and
quarterly results of both the Stan
ford-Washington and U.S.C.-Cali
fornia gridiron games will be given
throughout the four events by means
of a public address system. Admis
sion to the entire program will be
free.
