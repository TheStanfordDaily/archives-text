# S.C. Better than Last Year; Thornton Shakes Up Cardinal Team
## 
### 
Setting for themselves the goal of
staging a come-back in their quest
j for coast honors, Coach Nort Thorn
! ton's varsity water poloists will at
tempt to rout a determined cohort
j from Troy this afternoon at Encina
! Pools.
At 4:15 o'clock the opening gun is
i to be fired and the battle will get
â€¢under way. Today's lilt is expected
to prove much more than the rela
tively easy workout the Indians took
last year when they trounced the
Trojans 13-2.
Troy Stronger
It should be a highly aggressive
U.S.C. outfit that Captain John
I Paulsen and Gordon Warner, ace
forwards, will lead against the Card
inals and, what's more, the offense
will be bolstered by some very
capable guards.
The loss of Co-captain Bill Wood
cU'd to the Stanford septet, coupled
with the glaring weaknesses the In
dians demonstrated in their ill-fated
tilt with California last week, has
caused Thornton to make several
changes in the varsity line-up.
Wiget at Sprint
Wally Wiget, who formerly alter
nated at guard and forward, will
start at sprint; "Suds" Sutherland
has been moved up from guard to
hold down the position of left for
ward; Bill Clemo remains at right
i guard; Don Peterson, second
stringer until today, will start at left
(guard; Ben Voss, another former
j second-string man, is the new cen
ter back; and Chuck Giffin and Bob
Haslacher, right forward and goalie,
respectively, will swim at their regu
lar posts.
Pre-game dope gives the Farm
mermen a slight edge over the Tro
jans; anything, however, might
happen. Admission to the tilt will be
25 cents for students, upon presen
tation of student body cards, and 50
cents for all others.
