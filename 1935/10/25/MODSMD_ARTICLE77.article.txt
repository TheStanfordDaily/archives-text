WASHINGTON, Oct. 24 â€”
Secretary Ickes said today he did
not think fees submitted by Arthur
F. Mullen for legal services for Ne
braska public power districts were
reasonable and promised he would
give the fee question "as close atten
tion as it needs."
Mullen, former Nebraska National
Democratic committeeman, had re
quested $175,000 for legal service for
the Platte Valley public power and
irrigation district and the Loup Riv
er public power district, both in Ne
braska.
