STANFORD IS
ON THE WAY
DAVIS, Calif., October 24, 9
o'clock (Special to The Daily). —
A.s this trainload of Stanford Indians
speeds northward for the biggest
test of its 1935 football season to
morrow, conversation trends away
from much talk of the game. But
now and then there are words of the
morrow.
One little bit is worth mention
ing. That was about the foxiness of
our good friend Coach Jimmy Phe
lan. It appears the Mr. Jim believes
that his first-string tackle Chuck
Bond may not start tomorrow be
cause of an attack of appendicitis
that struck last Wednesday during
practice.
Yes, there is a good chance that
Bond is really stricken seriously
and then again there is a chance
that it is just a "tummy ache." At
any rate, his name was included
in a linc-up wired from Wash
ington by the sports editor of the
Washington Daily with the casual
comment that Phelan feared he
Wouldn't start. However, his name
was still there and if Chuck is
really as ill as an appendicitis at
tack would render him, it is fairly
probable that the Huskies would
broadcast their weakness.
It seems rather possible that Mr.
Phelan's "appendicitis" story is used
for a reason. No coach likes to have
his team enter a game on tho heavy

lend of the odds. Washington i.s in
that position. Then also, Stanford is
tuned to fight from the underdog
; outlook. Word that Washington is
weakened by the loss of ;i valuable
, first stringer might induce Stanford
to become a trifle overconfident.
But as this tiain rolls north to
night there is little chance of over
confidence. Every man in this car
Jis well aware that Stanford faces
the toughest team it will meet dur
ing the season, Every man will fight
•to "Wax Washington" whether
■ Chuck Bond starts or not.

| Just before the team pulled out
this afternoon Assistant Coach John
! Bunn likened the 1935 Stanford foot
! ball year to the U.S. economic prob
lem. Didn't know Bunn •was an
1 economist but this i.s the way he
I sees the situation.
Back in the early part of 1929, the
| United States was riding high. That
, corresponds with the Stanford foot
ball set-up a month ago. Then there
was a gradual undermining of the
economic system. That's Stanford's
early loss of Grayson, Topping, and
Hamilton.
Then came the- stock market crash.
That was the U.C.L.A. game. And
then there was another slump. Stan
ford lost Alustiza. Then everything
started to get better. That is when
. Stanford defeats Washington.

Bond is really stricken seriously
and then again there is a chance
that it is just a "tummy ache." At
any rate, his name was included
in a linc-up wired from Wash
ington by the sports editor of the
Washington Daily with the casual
comment that Phelan feared he
Wouldn't start. However, his name
was still there and if Chuck is
really as ill as an appendicitis at
tack would render him, it is fairly
probable that the Huskies would
broadcast their weakness.
It seems rather possible that Mr.
Phelan's "appendicitis" story is used
for a reason. No coach likes to have
his team enter a game on tho heavy

lend of the odds. Washington i.s in
that position. Then also, Stanford is
tuned to fight from the underdog
; outlook. Word that Washington is
weakened by the loss of ;i valuable
, first stringer might induce Stanford
to become a trifle overconfident.
But as this tiain rolls north to
night there is little chance of over
confidence. Every man in this car
Jis well aware that Stanford faces
the toughest team it will meet dur
ing the season, Every man will fight
•to "Wax Washington" whether

this afternoon Assistant Coach John

lem. Didn't know Bunn •was an
1 economist but this i.s the way he
I sees the situation.
Back in the early part of 1929, the
| United States was riding high. That
, corresponds with the Stanford foot
ball set-up a month ago. Then there
was a gradual undermining of the
economic system. That's Stanford's
early loss of Grayson, Topping, and
Hamilton.
Then came the- stock market crash.
That was the U.C.L.A. game. And
then there was another slump. Stan

started to get better. That is when

STANFORD IS
ON THE WAY
DAVIS, Calif., October 24, 9
o'clock (Special to The Daily). —
A.s this trainload of Stanford Indians
speeds northward for the biggest
test of its 1935 football season to
morrow, conversation trends away
from much talk of the game. But
now and then there are words of the
morrow.
One little bit is worth mention
ing. That was about the foxiness of
our good friend Coach Jimmy Phe
lan. It appears the Mr. Jim believes
that his first-string tackle Chuck
Bond may not start tomorrow be
cause of an attack of appendicitis
that struck last Wednesday during
practice.
Yes, there is a good chance that
Bond is really stricken seriously

that it is just a "tummy ache." At
