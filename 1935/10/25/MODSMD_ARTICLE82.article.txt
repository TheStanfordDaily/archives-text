## Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily The Fight for the Rose Bowl Is On This Grading System and Honor Code Really Have Some Basis for Existence

"Vo* Campi" lakes up the cudgel ably
against "Hull Session," which yesterday
cleared itself of any charges of conservatism
by getting well out of the bounds of orthodoxy.
The writer of the Session conveyed several
impressions to his readers that he had no
intention of conveying. Yet he raised the ab
sorbing question of "What is Education?"
"Hull Session" meant to say that students
whose minds become locked during an exam
were entitled to an ocasional "sly peek" to be
used to open their own stores of knowledge,
not to borrow someone else's. It did not mean
to say that cheating at all times was to be
condoned. The columnist proclaims himself
as against hit-run driving, slipping in a cold
deck, and writing bum checks.
Hut, even granting "Hull Session" this much
less radical stand than it apparently took, it
seems impossible not to prefer siding with
the campus voice which delves much deeper
into the problem than the superficial "Hull
Session."
Psychologists have shown that there is a
definite correlation between high grades as a
whole and high retention of material in a
course aft.T an elapse of time. Studies also
tend to prove that as a class, honor students
do succeed more in later life than their lower
graded fellows. This does not mean, of course,
that all honor students will be successful;
nor does it deny that the grading system
works great hardships on individuals malad
justed to it.
Yet 111'- examination is the most practical
judge of comprehension that has been found;

the grade system is useful as a rough com
petitive sorter. The individuals who cannot
psychologically do themselves justice under
this system can scarcely use that fact as a
justification of cheating.
Rather the maladjusted individual is ex
pected to assume the what's-the-diff'erenee at
titude that leads to a development of self
sunicicricy. This constitutes part of a broader
view of education: that it is to develop the
student into a man capable of facing and
living life as a self-sufficient being. Educa
tion in the sense of producing mollycoddles
who whimper at low grades is no education
at all in any deep sense.
Concerned with what the world thinks was
"Hull Session." It inadvertently intimated
that innate knowledge was of no avail unless
the possessor has a hand-painted tag saying:
"I know Psych >logy; I have 111 units of H plus
in it." He condoned students who peek in
written exes that they may pour out their
pent-up treasure of knowledge that they may
gel pretty little symbols so everyone will know
they have that pent-up knowledge.
Quite another position is aimed at by the
"Vox Campi" scribbler when he points to the
self-satisfaction arising from following the
code. He might have made that self-develop
ment instead of satisfaction. Seemingly he is
one (may his tribe increase!) of the type that
says in effect: "I get what grade I get, but I
get it fairly; I get a few ideas in my cranium
that further my development; I get a little
stiff ness in my spine from observing the honor
code like a man."
