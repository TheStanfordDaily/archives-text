# For Students' Benefit
## 
### 
From the Conference Party, eyes of women
students and the rest »>l the campus turn to
one of the most deserving events of the Fali
Quarter the annual Chrysanthemum Tea
given by the Mothers' Club today. All funds
taken in will go directly to student aid, there
being no "gravy-train" among the mothers.
Last year 1200 guests contributed *1200
toward student welfare and *.">OO more toward

scholarship through the medium of the tea.
Yearly, a thousand or more guests have en
abled the Mothers' Club to carry on its
year's welfare activities by this event. Dues,
of course, sustain the other expenses of the
club— including the rest-home fund.
There are no limitations as to who may
come. The one-dollar admission charge is re
paid each guest in the form of entertainment.
Chrysanthemum Tea this afternoon, 2 to f>
o'clock. Women's Gymnasium, oilers a musi
cal history of Stanford in costume, as pre
sented by Masquers, the Stanford Symphony
Orchestra, and the Glee Club for the Mothers'
Club and its contributing guests.
