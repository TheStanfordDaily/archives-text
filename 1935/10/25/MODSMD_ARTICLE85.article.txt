## CONFESSIONS OF A ROW MAN 
### 
Not so long ago ... I too was a freshman . . .
living in Encina . . . eating in the commons . . . and
looking up to the Row as the Elysian heights to be
attained after a year of seasoning in the hall . . .
and after a series of test periods where my destiny
depended upon my ability to impress the keepers
of the mystic castles of the Row.

The first rushing period came for me and my
classmates just as it came for the Class of '39 this week.
How fortunate I must be, I thought. I received more
rushing bids than there were open dates. After making
random selections—how was I to know one house from
another—l mailed back my date cards and then care
fully kept each appointment.
Somehow the glamour of the fraternity life I had
heard about was missing during those short periods at
lunch and dinner at six different houses. The frater
nity men sat next to me during the meals, asked
amazingly naive questions, and embarrassed me with
their own discomfort. After a meal I shook hands
with a dozen or more and was "shown around the
house. Then more forced conversation until the time
for leaving. How relieved I felt, and how relieved they
looked as I went out the door!

This first glimpse into the Elysian heights was
thoroughly disillusioning, but when the next rushing
period came, I went through the same stereotyped
performance again. I got so I could call a few frater
nity men by name. Some of them, in turn, remembered
me, but others greeted nv* as an utter stranger. The
third, fourth, and even fifth rushing periods came and
went and though some of the houses tried to impress
me that it was a life and death matter for me to
"pledge at once and fill up "a mighty fine class," I
hesitated for the best way 1 had of judging a frater
nity was by the size and beauty of its house.

I talked to some of the other freshmen in Encina.
Many of them also were in a dilemma. "What a grut
system of rushing." was the way they summed up the
whole situation. At the last minute I made a sudden
choice. It was all I eould do. There was almost nothing
upon which I could base a rational decision aftc* those
five, stiff formal rushing sessions.

At Christmas time when I went home I asked some
of my friends about rushing at their colleges. "Oh.
it was great, they all told me. "There was one grand,
glorious round of parties, dinners, dances, and shows
and we really got to know some of the fraternity men
before we pledged. And after a week of constant rush
ing day and night we found out right enough who
wanted us and what bunch of fellows we wanted to
join up with." And they asked me how the system wa i
down at Stanford.
I didn't tell them.
