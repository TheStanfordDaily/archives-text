In an effort to bury the hatchet face and end the
state of war with the Roble women we offer the fol
lowing story:
During the sophomore-freshman jolly-up some en
terprising statistician found that seven of the women
in the Row's most exclusive sorority were decorating
the wall. Tlie little dog laughed to see such sport,
'cause the cute little Roble dishes were running away
with the spooncrs.
Another Roble story concerns a little woman who
took the "Make All Checks Payable to Stanford Uni
versity so seriously that she tried to make out one to
Stanford University to pay for her laundry. Any day
we may expect to see: "Stanford University, liberal
arts, engineering, law, business, and medical schools,
and cleaning and pressing while you wait."
Several Roble women became victims of a great
desire to go down to Paly. Since they had no means
to transport, they set out forthwith on foot. When
they got down by the Ad Building a nice, big car
driven by a man with a nice, kind face pulled up and
asked them if they wanted a ride. Since it was a nice,
big car, and the man had a nice, big face, and since
they were very, very tired, the Roble girls got in. The
nice, big car got down as far as Paly. Said the nice,
big face: "Do you mind if 1 drive* up Mayfield avenue
a minute?"
"No," chorused the maidens.
So they drove, and they drove up Mayfield avenue,
until they got up as far as Belmont. "This is as far
as I go, said the nice, big face, and let the poor girls
out of the car a long, long way from home.
