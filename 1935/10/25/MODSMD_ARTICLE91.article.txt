# TO PEEK OR NOT TO PEEK
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Many students undoubtedly will
j agree with the professors and the
| "Sessioner" that exams and grading
; systems lack meaning and fairness.
; However, the practical student may
j not feel that the suggestion of "peep
ing" is a cure.
Such methods invariably lead to
the penitentiary system of examina
tions — armed guards pacing the
aisles and peering over one's neck.
Soon it becomes a game to see which
side can get the most points—the
peckers or the keepers; all of which
adds to the confusion of those who
really try to think out the answers
I to the exam.
As for that feeling of self-satisfac
tion that follows observance of the
Honor Code, it is probably more
! valuable than first appearances dis
t close. This sense of pleasure in be
ing right goes hand in hand with thd
culture college tries to instill in the
student. It should be one of the few
j things we can carry along with us
| through life. To remove it would be
! to weaken the educational system
still more.
