# WHAT IS LIBERALISM?
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
"Willi the 'Journal,' most Stanford j
men will find much liberalism in this i
eviction"—from a Daily editorial on |
Michigan expulsions.
Saddest commentary on the
"broad, flexible outlook" is that it
invariably hurls the poor liberal, re
gardless of his elegant circurnspec- '•
lion, into the arms of base reaction- '
aries.
With sorrow, one notes that free- ;
dom's glittering knights, such as Mr. 1
Ruthven and our own editorial writ
er, find themselves all too often in |
the same couch with Mr. Hearst. |
Yet. Mr. Hearst's "liberalism" is 1
readily seen as a pardonable enthu- '■
siasm protecting his sizeable stake j
in the present system.
What validity has a "liberalism" i
which urges restriction of freedom
to the right to talk without the right 1
to act. Sincerity requires men to
say roughly what corresponds to
what they do; and it is the deed that
is decisive. Characteristic of the
liberalism you advocate is that it ,
encourages "free talk" bccause it is j
a stupefacient to action, tending to !
bind students to the illusion that ac
tion is not necessary where the !
winds of freedom blow.
I submit that it is a meager form ,
of "liberalism" which limits freedom :
of expression and pction to those ,
who are concerned with maintaining
the status quo. One expects it from

those of the Hearst ilk, and from
'those college authorities who prize
the regard of the master class more
than the health of nation, but not
from college editors.
—R. Lynden
Expelled students evidently were
restricting the freedom of others,
; which liberalism does not approve.
