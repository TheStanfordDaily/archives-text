# AGAINST FLIPPANCY
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
I I should like to take the stand in
1 defense of Student Opinion.
When criticism or comment is
| made by any student upon, a subject
of student concern it should at least
; be received with decent respect.
Mr. Sharrock's comment yester
day was pertinent. It was offered in
an intelligent and gentlemanly tone.
It is absolutely disgusting to have to
■ read at the bottom of his comment,
j in heavy black type, a nasty sarcasm
! telling Mr. Sharrock to go back
where he came from. I seriously
> question whether or not the campus
| would endorse that contribution to
: what is called campus opinion.

If a campus opinion is of sufficient
interest to warrant comment from
the editor that comment should be
made editorially in the editorial
column.
It is regrettable that so many
pieces of student opinion have been
distorted and maligned by some flip
sarcasm.
—Ken Livingston
Because Mr. Sharrocks* letter
before deletion contained a mali
cious question as to whether "this
book-stealing (was) due to the
natural predatory habits of our
Indians?" and like remarks, wc
felt flippancy appropriate.—Ed.
