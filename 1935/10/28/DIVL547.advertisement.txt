Home Again!
We're back in Palo Alto again—in a temporary loca
tion, it is true —but we're back and that's the important
thing.
Thirty-nine years ago Ernest (Sticky) Wilson, while
attending Stanford, started business life with the idea
that quality confections would forever have an appeal,
and so Wilson's became a Palo Alto institution almost
as well known as Stanford itself.
Old Man Depression hit us, as he did so many, but
we're still in the ring starting again from scratch.
We're offering the finest candy that money and four
decades of experience can produce, for only 70 cents
per pound.
If we charged 10 times the price, we couldn't make
it any better or purer.
Wilson's of Palo Alto
Temporary Location (But Not for Long)

Dollars to Bum?
9 Maybe the dough-heavy college playboy of your
father's time could burn his twenty-dollar bills
to make a big impression on his latest flame, but
it's a lot different today. You college students
must spend your allowance wisely and make
every dollar count.
O That is the reason we recommend that you
patronize DAILY advertisers. Without excep
tion they are merchants who keep up with fh«
modern business trends and are prepared to
give you the greatest value for every dollar you
tpand.
