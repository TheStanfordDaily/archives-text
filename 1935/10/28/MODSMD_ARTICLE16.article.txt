# Europeans Deplore War, Says Minister
## 
### ROBERT WILCOX 
"The people of Europe do not
want war. Even in such militaristic
nations a.s Germany, Italy, and Rus
i sia, there is a_ fund of good will
| toward European neighbors." This
was the impression gained by Bishop
James C. Baker of the Methodist
Episcopal Church during his stay on
the continent last summer.
Bishop Baker spoke at a dinner
given in his honor yesterday by the
Wesley Foundation, Methodist stu
dent group.
Nationalism Separates Nations
"There is a growing disunity
I among the nations of Europe.
Boundaries are barriers separating
one country from another," the
speaker stated. These states which
are so sharply separated are under
the influence of a perverted na
tionalism. which accentuates the
national traits of one people as
; gainst those of another. This is
most apparent in Russia, Germany,

Italy."
The dictatorial state has to de
pend upon force, cruelty, and vio
lence for its preservation. Bishop
Baker declared. Those who are not
converted by propaganda arc forc
ibly dealt with. He cited the de
struction of the Kulak class in Rus
sia by the Communists and the Nazi
purge of June 30, 1934, in which
more than 1100 people were killed.
He found the gospel of hate being
preached throughout Europe.
Freedom Is Vanishing
'"You see all through Europe the
vanishing of the great human liber
tics. There is less freedom in the
world today than there has been in
the last 2000 years," Baker declared.
"Men talk frankly of doing away
with liberty. There is a challenge to
Americans to recognize that it is not
at all impossible for us to fall under
a communist or fascist dictatorship
—more likely the latter, in the near
future," he pointed out.
