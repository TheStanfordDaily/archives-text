# 300 Editors At Press Meeting
## High School Journalists Attend Farm Sessions 
### 
Describing the affair as "the best
we have ever had," Professor Chil
ton R. Bush, executive head of the
Stanford journalism department,
yesterday said the twelfth annual
Central California Scholastic Press
Association convention here Satur
day drew nearly 300 representatives
from at least 10 more schools than
in previous years.
Although representation this year
was limited to four delegates from
each publication, the actual attend
ance was increased by the larger
number of papers, magazines, and
yearbooks represented.
Praises Criticisms
"The most satisfactory thing about
the convention was the criticism of
papers by members of Sigma Delta
Chi, professional journalism frater
nity," Professor Bush said. Mem
bers of the fraternity prepared criti
cisms of the papers and led round
table discussions Saturday after
noon.
Bob Jones, president of Sigma
Delta Chi, and Gray Creveling, in
charge of the fraternity's partici
patipn, also were enthusiastic about
the increase in schools represented.
May Limit Delegates
Jones indicated yesterday it may
be necessary next year to limit the
number of delegates still more.
The delegates attended section
al meetings and a business ses
sion in the morning and were
guests at a noon luncheon and the
annual banquet. The Central Cali
fornia Association of Journalism
Advisers also held a business meet
ing.
