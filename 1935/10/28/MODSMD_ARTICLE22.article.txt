# Red Machine Overpowers Huskies, 6-0
## Grayson, Muller, Moscrip Star for Indians In Fiery Comeback 
### Gordy Frost 
EN ROUTE TO PALO ALTO, Oct. j
27.—Stanford's massive red machine ;
is rollin' now—racing right for the
Bowl of Roses—ridin' toward the top
of the Coast Conference—and, to
night, rollin' mighty happily to the
old Farm.
It was a glorious display of
football that machine gave Satur
day when it ripped through the
pride of the Northwest and left
Washington's Huskies battered,
bedraggled, beaten 6-0.
Bobby Grayson, Wes Muller,
Monk Moscrip, in fact the whole
bunch, won't long be forgotten
around Seattle. Jimmy Phelan,
coach of the Huskies, spoke to that
effect. "Stanford had the finest
morale and the finest team that I've
seen in many a year. They would
n't be beaten. And from now on
they shouldn't be beaten."
It was that spirit, that "won't
lose" spirit, plus a game of sparkling
football that won for Stanford. Bob
by Grayson was at his best. He
twisted, sliced, knifed through again
and again to show that packed sta
dium of 40 thousand that their "By"
Haines, though a mighty good ball
piayer, is not a second Grayson.
Stars on Defense, Too
Monk Moscrip's seldom-failing
toe swung twice at the pigskin,
and twice chalked up three points
for Stanford, both kicks being made
in the first quarter of play. And
time after time Monk slipped
through to drop Husky backs behind
the line.
And Wes Muller turned in a
performance that brands him the
finest center on the coast. Twice
Muller intercepted Husky passes,
and on defense, backing up the
line, he plugged the center gap
unfailingly.
Little Jim Coffis and Joe Vigna
were there, too. They pounded the
Husky tackles and guards as they
went through those positions for
gains most every time.
Linemen Inspired
And Bill Paulman blocked and
kicked well, and pushed through
the center of the line for good
gains. Keith Topping was in the
ball game, also, and those Wash
ingtonians knew it after he sped
down under punts to stop their
Haines.
The guards and tackles were
playing unflinching ball. They
opened fine holes for Grayson and
they stopped up holes for Haines.
Stanford played good defensive
ball, protected her six points like
| a mother lion her cub. Twice the
j Huskies got into scoring tcrri
! Tory, once to the 16-yard line, but
i Stanford fought off their tally
j threats. "By" Haines was a con
stant menace.
Stanford, again on the victory
i 1 wagon, meets Santa Clara next Sat
| urday. Buck Shaw, Btonco line
j coach, was in the press box scout
j ing the Indians Saturday.
Buck says frankly that if Stanford
j plays the same ball thoy did last
j week-end against the Broncs Satur-
I day "we'll never stop them and
! probably nobody will this year."
