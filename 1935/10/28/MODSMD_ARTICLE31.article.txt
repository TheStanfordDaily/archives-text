# 'Welcome Home' Rally Greets Indians Today
## Rooters Will Stage Parade, Escort Squad Rally Committee Sponsor Of Event, Renews Grid Pep Drive Large Turnout Urged Victors To Reach Palo Alto at 11:59 Today 
### Herb Diamond 
To welcome Coach Tiny Thornhill
and his victorious Indian gridders
back to the Farm, students will stage
a "Welcome Home" rally when the
Cascade Limited from Seattle pulls
into Palo Alto at 11:59 o'clock this
morning.
Yell Leader Dick Stark and his
two junior assistants, Web Jones
and Talbot Shclton, will be 011
hand to add spirit and pep to the
festivities as the football squad is
escorted up Palm Drive to the
campus.
Although classes will not be dis
missed early, it will be possible for
students having 11 o'clocks to reach

the station in time for the mass
greeting, since the train is not due
until noon.
The committee expects a large re
sponse to this opportunity for wel
coming a staunch team of Stanford
men who answered the Farm's re
quest to "Wax Washington" by do
ing just that.
"Although the Indians were the
underdogs in Saturday's game,
they showed their ability to come
through," saiy Bob Jones, Cardi
nals member, last night, "Every
Stanford student should turn out
at the depot today to let Coach
Thornhill and the team know
that we are, and always will l>e,
backing them. We want to re
tain that victory spirit in next
Saturday's tilt with Santa Clara,
so let's renew our pep drive with
plenty of enthusiasm today."
Rally committee members fur
ther pointed out the fact that al
though an auto serpentine coiled
through the streets of Palo Alto and
the Farm immediately after the
news of Stanford's victory reached
the campus, the team was not here
to see it. Today, they continued,
when members of the squad and
coaching staff step off the train, at
11:59 o'clock it will be their first
j real chance to hear and see the stu
dents' appreciation of their feat at
Seattle. And that display of ap
preciation should be a creditable
one.
Students are requested to gather
at the depot just before noon. Yell
: leaders and rally officials will in
| struct them, explaining plans for
greeting the Big Red Machine and
; for the parade back to the Farm,
both of which will express the sen
; timent of appreciation and "Wel
come Home."
