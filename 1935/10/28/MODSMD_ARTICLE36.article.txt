# CORRECTING THE FACTS

The Editor, Sir:
Referring to the letter of Mr.
Horace Shariocks, printed in the
Stanford Daily fop October 24, I
wish to make the following com
ment:
1. The Trustees of Stanford Uni
versity have very wisely adopted a
xesolution (February 21, 1924), pro
viding that certain sets of periodicals
may be used only within the library
building. This prevents the possible
loss of valuable and irreplaceable
material.
2. All graduate students are per
mitted free access to the bookstacks
and are not required to sign any
thing as a preliminary thereto.
3. The University cf California
Library does not allow bound vol
umes of periodicals to be taken
from the library building.
Nathan van Patten
Library Director

The Editor, Sir:
1 would like to point out in a
frit-ndly spirit the inconsistent stand
which The Daily is taking with re
gard to Vox Campi. If, as the dele
tions from Mr. Sharrocks' letter in
dicate, The Daily reserves the right
to delete comments of a malicious
nature, why does not The Daily ap
ply that noble principle to itself and
delete its own malicious comments?
Furthermore, I make a plea for the
preservation of a tradition which,
though relatively new, is well loved
by Stanford students, and that is a
column composed solely of student
opinion. If the editor feels the urge
to comment on ideas therein ex
pressed, let him do so in the editorial
column. I am sure he will tlie.i earn
the appreciation of the campus for
restoring the students what is right
iullv theirs.
