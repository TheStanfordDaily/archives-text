# ON THE SPOT AGAIN
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
The other day Mr. Sharrock tried
to give a criticism of a practice of
which Stanford cannot be proud.
More specifically, he made some fair
comments regarding the so-called
Stanford Honor System which is so
lacking in honor that students are
not trusted with bound periodicals
outside the library.
Whether this feeling on the part of
the student is justified or not is no
concern of mine here. What does
irritate me is the ungentlemanly way
his criticism (good or bad) was re
ceived by The Daily. Since when
hrive we old-timers at Stanford be
come satisfied with our point of re
pulsing opinion toward improving
it?
Please give us a Vox Campi that
is free from malice and wise-crack
ing that can't be answered. Or isn't
the editor included in the Vox Campi
requirement that there shall be no
comments "strictly malicious in na
ture."
Gordon G. Dunn, '35
