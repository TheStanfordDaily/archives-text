The Editor, Sir:
The editor's retprt (comment, if
you will) to Horace Sharrocks' com
munication in Vox Campi October
24, concerning the inaccessibility of
certain volumes in the library, was
uncalled for and certainly not what
one would expect from a Stanford
gentleman. The implication that Mr.
Sharrocks should return to U.C. if
he didn't like it here certainly won't
foster a feeling of good will.
Furthermore, Mr. Sharrocks is
right on the stand he takes.
