"Stanford authorities will deny
this, but it was not an eye ailment
that forced Frank Alustiza to quit
football. Last April, I exclusively
reported that Alustiza and Bobby
Grayson had a fist fight during
spring practice. Bad blood has al
ways existed between the two
backs. The team was torn by dis
sension and the U.C.L.A. whipping
was the last straw. Either Grayson
or Alustiza had to go. Bobby was
more valuable so he stayed. That's
why Alustiza suddenly became
blind."
This excerpt appears to me to be
I strictly malicious in nature and a
gross prevarication. How's about
| some of our alumni in the south
I cornering this lightly-penned Cohn
' letting him know how we feel about
! such journalistic misnomers.
