# Frosh Eleven Defeats Bulldogs
## Babes Score 9-0 Win Over J.C. Gridmen Recovery of Blocked Kick Accounts for Sole Card Touchdown 
### Roger Kimball 
Blocking a Sun Mateo punt and
falling on the ball for a touchdown,
Pete Zagar led Stanford's freshman
football team to a 9-0 victory over
the Peninsula Junior College eleven
on its home gridiron Saturday. The
yearlings had already scored a safe
ty, but it took Zagar'.s six points to
secure their triumph.
In the second quarter of an even
battle, San Mateo found itself with
the ball dangerously close to its goal
line. With a great surge, the entire
lvosh forward wall drove in to throw
the Bulldog ball carrier in the end
zone for a safety and a lead of 2 to 0.
Jimmy Bradshaw's '39 gridders were
still hanging on to this narrow mar
gin, in spite of numerous Bulldog
threats, when the stage became set
for Zagar's third-period fest.
Blocks Punt
The Jaysees had the ball on their
own 15-yard stripe, and tried to kick
the pigskin beyond midfield. Hardly
had it left the foot of their punter
when it struck Zagar's chest and
bounded crazily backward. Fast and
alert, the huge tackle from the state
of Washington chased the ball over
the San Mateo goal line and fell on
it before any of the surprised Bull
dogs could save the situation. Ed
Gamier, quarterback who seldom
missed conversions, added the extra
point in a place-kick.
A Stanford kick was blocked in
the final canto, but did no serious
damage. Neither team took to the
air to a great extent. The Card
yearlings completed only one pass
out of five attempts, and the Bull
dogs made good only twice.
Zagar Stars
It is hard to name a star for the
Indians, since the entire team played
moderately good ball. Pete Zagar
was again a tower of defensive
strength, besides scoring the only
touchdown—outdoing the backs and
ends of both teams—in a game which
the Papooses won without once car
rying, place-kicking, or passing to
a receiver, over the Bulldog goal.
Stanford's line-up Saturday was
as follows: Ends, Butler, Stojkovich,
Curnmings, and Holmquist; tackles,
Zagar, West, and Carnahan; guards,
Crowe, McMillan, Davis,, and Gus
tafson; center, Sutton; quarterback,
Garnier; halfbacks, Fay, Huebel,
Veenker, and Kirsch; fullback, De-
Witt,
