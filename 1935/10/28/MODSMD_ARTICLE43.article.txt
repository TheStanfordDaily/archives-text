Bob Brittingham, California end, reached out his arms to gather in this pass from Don Fowler, Bear half
back, in the Bear-Trojan game at Berkeley Saturday. But the ball didn't land in the proper place because
Fullback Probst of Southern California reached out from behind to bat it away. That was all right, for two
plays later Fowler passed over the goal line to Bob's brother Jack for the first California score. (Associated
