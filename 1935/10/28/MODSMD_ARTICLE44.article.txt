# Drofnats Chalks Up 100% Victory In Grid Prophesy
## 
### 
The lug's on the wing, the kale's
on the Thornhill, Gros's in his office,
all's right with the world, chirruped
that old Groshopped Sylvestre Dji
bouti Drofnats as he took his crystal
ball around right end. "He's away,
he's away, he's going down the field.
One tackier, two tacklers, two
blockers, two block and tacklers,
they nail him for a five-yard lost."
Comrade Drofnats was inflated
and elated over his .100 per centism
over the week-end. Sylvestre picked
his rabbits before they hutched.
Down to the last man, the right
teams won this week.
"Such bulwarks against Commun
ism are exceptionally heartening to
me, seeing that so many radicals
have been cropping up and the
wrong teams have been winning.
I am pleased with such bulwarks,
because my bulwarks every week
end."
Drofnats' bulwarked so well this
week-end, in fact, that he correctly
predicted the winning team in every
instance, and even, forsooth, gauged
to a fraction the score of the S.C.-
Cal fractious; in fact, Drofnats pre
dicted the score would be 21-7 and
21-7 it was. Many other closc calls
were made. The minutes were read
and approved.
