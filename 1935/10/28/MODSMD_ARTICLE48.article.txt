# Bears, Bruins Coast Leaders
## Troy Defeated 21 to 7; Uclans Down Oregon 
### 
University of California's Bears
beat "poor Troy" Saturday, thereby
remaining undefeated, but a butch
in the last six seconds of play cost
them their unscored-on boast. Long
passes netted Stub Allison's boys
! their advantage. Not quite 74-0, but
a neat 21-7.
The Uclans turned on the power
to trim Oregon, 33-6, so with the
j Big Red Machine's victory over
Washington, the Bears and the
Bruins remain conference leaders.
But it also remains that Stanford
is the team to watch. By bottling up
Washington's Cain, Haines, and the
others, a bright Cardinal hue was
j smeared with the Blue and Gold in
j the Pasadena mixed-up Bowl.
In the small persons of Don Fowl
er and Bill Archer, Stub Allison
showed a pair of left halfback
: threats reminiscent of the War bur
tons, Kaers, and Hylands. Both
rambled through the Troy tackles
i almost at will, and passed to the
Brittingham Boys and Sam Chap
| man to completely perforate the
! Trojan wooden horse.
Other scores were: Santa Clara 20 ;
i Portland 7; Idaho 14, Montana 7
