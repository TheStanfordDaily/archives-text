# Chappie Offers To 'Finish' Daily Staff
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
We of the Chaparral staff,
sound of mind und body, which
is more than you are, and that's
not saying much, have grown a
trifle weary of reading your
putrid paper. As a matter of
fact, we feel that there is but
one way of putting a stop to it.
And that is this:
We hereby consent to kill off
all the members of your staff
in a fierce game of football to
be played in the Stanford sta
dium, Saturday afternoon, No
vember 2.
We suggest that you care
fully consider our challenge
before making a decision. As a
special inducement, Hammer
and Coffin Society is offering
free funeral arrangements for
all Daily "men" participating
in the game with us.
Hoping to hear from you
soon, I remain,
Lugubriously,
A. James Copp 3d
"Old Boy"
