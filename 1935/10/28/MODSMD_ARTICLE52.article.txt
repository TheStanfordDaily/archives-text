# Teachers Tie Card Soccer Team, 0-0

### 
Lady Luck wasn't with the Stan-
I ford soccer team Saturday when
| they played San Jose State in the
[ southern city.
The Indians played a bang-up
, game for the whole 120 minutes,
i making numerous attempts to score,
I but the pingskin refused to enter
j the goal and the game ended in a
I deadlock, 0-0.
Curds Pound Goal
Time and again Sawyer, inside
1 right for Stanford, made beautiful
shots and each time the ball either
hit the cross-bar or failed by inches
to score. The whole forward wall
performed well in getting the ball
| centered but couldn't seem to put it
into the net.
San Jose played a rough game
from start to finish and the In
dians' forward wall took a beating.
Helms, goalie, had to leave the game
in the second quarter with an in
! jured eye, to be replaced by Pinotti.

However, in spite of the roughing !
they took, the men continued to j
keep the ball in scoring territory
and, but for the tough breaks, would
have scored several times.
Defense Strong
On defense, the Stanford team
looked very good and especially j
through the stellar efforts of the
halfbacks. Hatch, Hall, "tnd Sloan, j
the few San Jose advances were j
nipped before they became dan- j
gerous. The fullbacks, Captain 1
Vierling and McCormick also de
serve plenty of credit for their splen- j
did performance on the defensive '
end.
Helms was injured when a ball, i
kicked by a San Jose forward, |
struck him in the eye and caused ,
temporary blindness but late yes
terday he had recovered except for
a little blackness. It is expected that
he will be back in the line-up for
the U.S.F. game scheduled lor th-: ,
home field next Saturday.
