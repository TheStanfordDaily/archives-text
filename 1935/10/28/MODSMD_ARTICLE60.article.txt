Stanford went "rah-rah" last week—and
the results were surprisingly pleasant. The
Farm's first determined dip into the field of
football consciousness in more than two years
provided a physically crippled Indian varsity
with enough fighting spirit to earn an honest
gridiron victory from a Washington eleven
that was "sure it would win" Saturday.
The 0-0 conquest clearly exemplified the
practical value of a "victory attitude." More
specifically, il was made possible because
Stanford's student body and football players
had finally arisen from flic doldrums of grid
iron luxury and actually had become con
scious of the fact that they had a team which,
good ;is il was, was subject to defeat—a team
which did not have the same llower-strewn
path to Ibe Rose Howl that il had traveled
during the past two years.
On the contrary, students realized, the
Pasadena route was a perilous, unimproved
dirt road, filled with ruts and in places merely
a narrow ledge on the rim of ;i dangerous j
precipice. One slip, and fhe Big Red Machine 1
would careen down to the depths of the j

chasm, jumbled beyond repair.
Last week the student body hurriedly set
to work paving and grading this highway.
They succeeded in smoothing one-fifth of the
route, which included one of the most peri
lous spots on the entire road. However, In
dian Rose Bowl hopes would be just as dead
if they cracked up farther along the trip as if
they had slipped last week.
Repair work and reinforcing of the high
way through' Santa Clara, U.S.C., Montana,
and California in the next four weeks are still
necessary if Stanford expects to reach Pasa
dena by January 1.
Stanford has again taken her place among
the leaders of the Pacific Coast gridiron race.
However, it would be fatal for the Farm sup
porters to slip back into their old role of care
less indifference and supreme over-confidence
the attitude that was largely responsible for
the one black mark on the 193.") schedule. The
Indians still must face four opponents, any
one of which might shatter their champion
ship chances.
The Rose Bowl light is on not won.
