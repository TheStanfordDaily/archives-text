Having in the "Vox Campi" column is a
battle over the light of the editor to make
comments at the end of the contributions to
the column. So far, printed opinion has been
against the exercising of such a right.
The comments, an innovation this volume,
we re started because a rebuttal to the often
one-sided, usually grossly over-stated con
tentions was considered necessary to tone
down such assertions. This was especially true
when replies could not be run side-by-side.
It was fell that corrections of fact or remind
ers of the existence of another side could
scarcely be amiss.
Perhaps some of the retorts were consid
ered as taking unfair advantage of the writ
ers. Any contributor to the column, however,
realizes that he is laying himself or herself
open to criticism with each letter written, as
does every writer of the Daily with each ar
ticle written.
Editorial notes on future "Vox Campi" let
ters will he restricted to an explanation or a
refutation, only when either the content of
the letters or the spirit in which they were
written subject themselves to comment. The
editor reserves this right since he is held re
sponsible for everything appearing jn the
paper.
