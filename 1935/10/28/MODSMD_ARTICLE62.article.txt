# A 						"Scoop" Gone Wrong
## 
### 
One of the most miserable pieces ol' tripe
â– written about footballers in many a day
comes to the attention of the campus this
morning through the alertness of a' "Vox
Gmipi" contributor.
"Maliciously libelous" is the only phrase
that would describe a writer who finds that
Frank Alustiza has lain in the hospital for
two weeks and is about to be operated on
merely to hide "bad blood" between Hobby
(irayson and himself.
Stanford's authorities do not have to deny
such a rumor; any Stanford man with a
tongue in his head will do it for them. Losing
an occasional game is bad enough; but to have
the Indian team, which bows lo none in co
operative spirit and is headed by a fair and
liberal coach if there ever was one, labeled
"lorn by dissension" is too much.
Libel actions are a hit odoriferous. Vet it
might not be amiss lor the A.S.S.t . lo demand
retraction and an apology from the blunder
ing scribe.
