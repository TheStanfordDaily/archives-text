The Rally Committee may now say with pride, I
Stanford Waxed, while Washington waned."
The fast girl that sweeps in from the North will |
bring to our cars the clash of resounding arms, as
sorority sister greets sorority sister.
Because everyone's thoughts were in the North
over 'he week-end, Our Hasher had a hard time keep
ing track of the vagaries oT campusites. And so Our
Hash has "A Sudden Dearth" of material.
Some fraternity men were sitting around Saturday |
night trying to think up something to do. Roller skat- |
ing and model airplanes seemed not quite fitting for i
it triumphal affair. So the scholars finally commis- '
sioned a sophomore to go round-up some entertain
ment for the evening. The sophomore knew not quite j
what to do, but being an exceedingly quick young \
gentleman, he girded up his car and histed himself j
down the Row, in pursuit of happiness. Finally as he ;
hove to next to the Union, he saw his entertainment
walking down the street. He rounded up his enter- i
tainment, six of em, in fact, and girded back to the
house. Completely flabbergasted they were, to see the
six entertainments "direct to you from a five weeks' !
engagement at Roble Hall. So the rest of the evening i
was spent in cards, dancing, and entertainment.
• What to do these long, winter evenings has finally I
been solved by the Chi Omegas. Though some spirit
ualists specialize in table-rapping, the Chi O's have
worked floor tapping down or up to a fine art. When
some gals in a third floor room started tapping on their
floor, the occupants of the room below, resenting it'
quite properly, took golf clubs and rapped on the
ceiling. The little ladies above, couldn't quite under- 1
stand what was happening and became very frightened
by it all. Ever ready to convince alumni as to need
for the new house they're going to build next summer,
the Chi O's bruited it about that the house was
Milling. Jhf answer was yes, its settling—for cash.
