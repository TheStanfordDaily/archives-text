## SURREPTITIOUS MR. HEARST 
### 
W.R.H.'s favorite phrase of invective is "surrepti
| tious radicalism." The word "surreptitious," however,
; carries no condemnation. For Mr. Hearst, from his
' newest movie, "Shipmates Forever," is himself "sur
! reptitiously"—fascistic.
It is questionable how many movie-goers, even
1 Stanfordites, noticed the tell-tale "Cosmopolitan Pro
! ductions" at the bottom of the title frame of "Ship
mates Forever." But those two words, the name of
i Hearst feature picture enterprises, completely ex
! plained both the supreme cleverness and the "surrep
titiousness" of the film.

With typical cunning, Mr. Hearst, employed all the
I reliable dodges of celluloid entertainment to sugar
coat his doctrinary pill. There were sobs, laughs, and
thrills, not bald fact, to convey the pleasantness of
I naval service, the high honor of lethal training, and
i female predilection for fighting men.
Entertainment, Mr. Hearst knew, would take care
I of those movie-goers unconvinced by anti-war argu-
I ments.
Meanwhile, to lull those of us waiting for the first
| Hearstianism, he very cleverly infused a few some
! what anti-militaristic ideas, then suddenly and
smoothly twisted them to his purpose.

Scenarist, director, cameraman, and actor all were
I guided by what they saw through the special Hearst
rose-colored glasses. Life in Annapolis, they chorused,
is not only good fun, but inspiring, dramatic, roman
tic, and thrilling—everything that any of us could
wish a life to be.
This "naval life" was cleverly built into something
analagous to the Hindu heaven. Only incidentally did
national glory trail along with more familiar, pleasant
situations and things, just as the glory of the Indian
after-life is only incidental to the pleasures of the
flesh, amply provided in Nirvana.

The strange results were that all degrees of both
war-haters and war-howlers received a darned pleas
ant evening, and only incidentally the sub-conscious
idea that the fighting man's life is a lot of iun, that
warships are beautiful, and that the navy man pickcd
a swell profession.
We wouldn't lifte to be quoted, however, as saying
' that Mr. Hearst, besides having an eye on the box
office, had an eye on naval treaties, war clouds, and
boatloads of soldiers ready and willing to kill and be
I killed. —Bob Eisenbach
