The Editor. Sir:
Perhaps, because I am a member
| of the now almost extinct 500, my
views are those of a minority group.
Therefore, though hestitating to be
considered mid-Victorian, and at the
! risk of seeming antiquated, I never
theless take exception to the re
marks of our esteemed Bull Ses
; sionist concerning the worth of our
I Honor Code.
May I say that it is our conception,
! we v/ho are sponsors of Roble and
the Union Unit, that the incoming
freshmen and transfers to our col
lege life should believe in the hith
erto respected Honor Code. Not only
because it stands for what we have
thought to be good sportsmanship,
but because it is a symbol of what
Stanford has always been proud of
—consideration for others, and hon
esty to ourselves.
If we teach our younger men and
women that the cry " —why should
n't we cheat? ' is a valid one, then
we v/ho are soon graduating do not
lose, but Stanford of the future
loses . . . collectively. And the
: standards that have always been
Stanford's are irretrievably gone.
