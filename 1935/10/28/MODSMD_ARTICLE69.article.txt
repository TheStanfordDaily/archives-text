# ANNOYED—SIS WORTH

The Editor, Sir:
I ve heard so much about Stanford j
traditions in the years I've been here ,
that I really believed they meant
something. I always assumed that -
Stanford believed in a square deal, !
but recently I was rudely awak
ened.
Last spring a gullible Stanford :
enthusiast purchased a ring—an ofTi- i
cial Stanford ring, as advertised in '
I he Chaparral—for the tidy sum of :
$25. Now this student doesn't mind j
paying five or ten dollars for a
ring that lurns out to be misrepre- 1
sented, but to pay $25 rather irri- i
tates his epidermis.
I .suppose this unofficial protest !
will irritate yours and other staunch i
Stanford nerve centers. By not
printing this written objection of j
epidermis, you can preserve the

| peaceful slumbers of the Stanford
j ites' nerve centers and foster the
| fallacy that Stanford always carries
| out her end of the bargain.
