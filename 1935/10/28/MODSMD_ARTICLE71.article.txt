KNXtra: L.A.'s powerful inde
j pendent, KNX, steps out November
1 when it starts a third California
chain, taking in itself and KSFO,
San Francisco, as competition for the
! Don Lee net.
The new hook-up will start with
the 5-7 p.m. spot nightly. KNX will
i bear all line charges, amounting to
i about $35,000 a year on approxi
mately 450 miles of wire. Only sus
taining programs will be fed at first,
in an attempt to build up an au-
J dience.
And on November 3, KNX gets
Father Coughlin's weekly broad
j casts. No announcement yet as to
whether KSFO will be in on this.
MORE POWER to the nation's ra

, erful than any station but WLW, and
the general upping of regional sta
tions from 1000 to 5000 watts.

during the week on WLW at 8:30.
