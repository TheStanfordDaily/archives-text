# Spirited Rooters Greet Victorious Team at Station
## Rally Committee Makes Plans for Renewed Farm Pep Drive Alustiza Meets Team Cars Serpentine In Parade Celebrating Victory 
### 
It was a spirited band of Stanford
looters that gave Coach Tiny
Thornhill and his victorious Indian
gridders a warm welcome when
they stepped off the train at noon
yesterday.
Even Frankie Alustiza donned
a pair of glasses and deserted his
hospital hod to meet the Big Red
Machine that went up to Seattle
and routed a pack of determined
Washington Huskies. Alustiza,
who will he taken to San Fran
cisco this week to undergo an eye
operation, was among the first to
congratulate members of the
squad.
He, as well as a mass of equally
enthusiastic rooters, exemplified the
sentiment of the entire campus, in
praising the team again and again.
To the waxers of Washington went
a barrage of adjectives that ex
pressed real admiration of their vic
torious campaign.
At the same time, while the
rooters' yells were still ringing in
their ears, members of the Rally
Committee and the Cardinals
were laying plans for a renewed
pep drive that will serve to keep
Farm spirit at a high pitch as the
Indians prepare to meet Santa
Clara Saturday afternoon.
Having subdued Washington — a
difficult hurdle to negotiate under
any circumstances—the possibility of
continuing down the path to future
championships is not so far out of
ihe picture for the Indian gridiron
aggregation. Students realize this
fact, rally officials point out, and
with but a little encouragement the
spirit of the campus should be keyed
to a high pitch that will prove any
thing but a handicap to the future
performances gf the Big Red Ma
chine.
In escorting the gridiron war
riors up Palm Drive and hack to
the Farm, rooters showed the
team exactly what their reaction
was when news of the Stanford
victory first reached the campus.
A rejuvenated serpentine of cars
coiled through the streets, hut
yesterday it was longer and set up
a louder clamor than its predeces
sor did last Saturday afternoon.
Thus, echoing a stronger senti
ment than ever before, the Farm
received its staunch gridiron rep
resentatives. It was a hearty "Wel
come Home" to the men who halted
the Huskies.
