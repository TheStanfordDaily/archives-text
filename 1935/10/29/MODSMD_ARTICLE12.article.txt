# Quad Reroofing Sends Dust Storm Into Lab
## 
### 
Anyone who has had to wash his
neck twice a week lately because of
tile du.st sifting down his back from
the roof of the electrical engineer
ing laboratory may have wondered
just why the covering of that par
ticular building is undergoing reno
vation.
The reason is that the old one
leaked. Dean Hoover and other
dignitaries of the engineering
building's complaining that during
rain storms their offices serve
much better as bath-tubs than as
cloisters of study and labor.
A new type of tile known as Cor
dova, the same as was put on La

gunita Court and will go on the new
theater, is replacing the 35-year-old
leaky covering.
To avoid undue earthquake
strain, carh new tile, instead of
being nailed directly in placc,
will be hung from a wire about a
foot long which is nailed to the
hoarding above the tile.
The University is taking advan
tage of a price war among tile manu
facturers in its present re-roofing
projects. The electrical engineer
ing lab is the third building to be
retiled this fall, the History-Eng
lish and Engineering Corner build
ings having been finished recently.
