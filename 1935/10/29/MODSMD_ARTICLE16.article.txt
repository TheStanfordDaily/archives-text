# Students To Collect Fuel For Big Blaze
## Record Fire Planned As Defy to Golden Bears 
### 
Within a 35 or 40-foot square
will go, on November 21, all the
boxes, scrap lumber, tree limbs,
and discarded wood that Stanford
students can collect as the Farm pre
pares to show its disdain for the
might of the California varsity grid
ders, with its Big Game bonfire.
Railroad ties needed in the
frame already have been secured
Boh Hoover, co-chairman, an
nounces, and telephone poles prob
ably will be obtained without dif
ficulty. Acquisition of the ties
and poles will assure the construc
tion of the huge framework and
the rest of the fire is up to the
students.
Several years ago a 30-loot square
was built and sufficient, material
was obtained to raise the pile 79
feet. Hoover and Bob Jones, ad
visory co-chairman, believe that
with student co-operation that fire
can be eclipsed.
The central committee in charge
of arrangements has been divided
into three suh-groups, one to get
trucks and collect the filler mate
rial, another to obtain and place
the poles and ties and determine
the cost of construction, and a
third to arrange smokers, get pub
licity for the bonfire in peninsula
newspapers, and seek a sound
truck.
Workers will be amply supplied
with provisions to stave off hunger
and longings for luxuries during the
building activities, under plans be
ing made by women of the central
committee.
Row and Hall women are to join
in providing food for a noon lunch
eon and in addition cigarettes, gum,
candy, and ice cream v/ill be served
during the clay.
Within a short time a campaign
for workers will be started. Men
will be asked to help on the con
struction during free periods and
the committee will attempt to ar
range the force so that operations
can continue steadily.
