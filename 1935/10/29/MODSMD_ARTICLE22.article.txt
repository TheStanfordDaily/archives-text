# Brooke Asks Students To 'Slow Down'
## 
### 
In conjunction with a campus
wide drive to reduce traffic dan
gers, Wally Brooke, A.S.S.U. presi
dent, last night issued the follow
ing statement:
Traffic problems upon the
Stanford campus are handled by
the Men's and Women's Coun
cils, which act under delegated
authority from President Wilbur
and the Board of Trustees.
This year, as always, these
council members are using every
reasonable method at their dis
posal to prevent the recurrence
of the annual deaths that concern
Farm students due to speeding
and recklessness. They are handi
capped by various things: (1)
the ignorance or "Joe College" at
titude of many students about
these traffic deaths; (2) the slight
increase violations this fall
due probably to increased en
rollment; (3) the gruff manner in
which many of them receive fines
from fellow student council
members.
Let's remember to watch the
"step on it" down Palm Drive,
where many serious accidents
have occurred. Let's watch the
clearly marked parking zones, and
remember that student control
over its traffic problems is much
superior to state, local, or faculty
supervision.
