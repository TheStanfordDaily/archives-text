# Woodpecker Lodge Is Ready For Quad Move
## 
### 
No longer cramped, no longer [
handicapped by two-by-four offices
; in the overcrowded Press building,
the 1936 Quad saw its dreams real
i ized last week-end when Corpora- :
I ation Yard workmen laid down
i hammer and saw, and left a reno- j
j vated Woodpecker Lodge for Quad
I officials.
Most important part of the new
'•plant" in the old Roblc Gym is
the only publication-owned dark
room on the campus. Designed
by Don Gibson, staff photographer,
j who will work in it. the dark
room is absolutely light-proof.
An ingenious "light-trap" catches
any light which might get in
through the door to ruin valuable
prints and negatives.
This week the Quad will provide
Gibson with $100 worth of photo
graphic equipment, including the

latest model enlarger. Don Hanson,
editor, estimates that the year-book
will save more than two-thirds of
its former picture bill by doing its
own enlarging and developing.
When plumbing and electricity
been connected next week, the
Quad studio will move lock, stork,
and barrel to (he new "shark."
Liberal space has been devoted to
the dark r»»on», studio, and pic
ture sales room. Editorial and
business offices have delayed
moving until Christmas vacation.
Overlooking the delapidatcd,
waterless swimming pool, the Wood
pecker Lodge renovation gives the
Quad four times the space of its
present Press building location. Both
Hanson and Chuck Fontius, busi
ness manager, have personal offices.
A large central room is lined with
shelves for the Quad library.
