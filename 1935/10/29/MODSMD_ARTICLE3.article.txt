# 'Red Toboggan' Slides Toward Bronc Contest
## Black To Replace Rouble At Guard Position 
### Gordy Frost 
Stanford still has a lot of foot
ball ahead this season. It was with
that thought in mind, that Tiny
Thornhill unloaded his victorious
Stanford varsity yesterday noon
with orders to "report for prac
tice at 4 this afternoon," giving the
"red toboggan"—so named by Bob
by Grayson—little chance to slow
up before its next encounter.
And at 4 o'clock Tiny and his gang
started work for their game next

Saturday with Santa Clara. Fhst
job for Tiny was the filling of a
first-string vacancy at right guard,
where Larry Rouble is forced to take
a two-weeks lay-off with a cracked
knee cartillage.
Thornhill plans to use Bob Black
at. the guard berth for a while.
Black has been working alternately
with Adams on the other side of
the line.
Rouble's condition is still more or
less questionable. Dr. Wilbur at one
time feared that the cartilage split
might keep him off the field for the

Jimmy Phelan after the
Washington game: "Stanford
has the best morale, and the
best team I've seen since I've
been at Washington. Grayson,
Muller, and the two ends
were Indian standouts."
' By" Haines: "It's hard to
take hut Stanford was better.
Geez, those guys had fight."
rest of the year but later reports
indicate that a two weeks' layoff
is more probable. He won't play
against Santa Clara Saturday—that
is a certainty.
Otherwise Stanford's varsity
will be in A-number-one shape for
the Brons. Buck Shaw, Santa
Clara line coach and scout, who
made the trip to Washington on
the Stanford train to scout the
Indians, is of the opinion that
Stanford will be in altogether too
good shape Saturday.
After that affair up north last
week-end Buck expressed his be
lief that Stanford will overpower
Santa Clara easily if the Indians
play the same kind of ball they did
agajnst Washington.
But at the same time he cannot
help but be thinking that there is a
chance that his Broncs might catch
Stanford off guard and stage an up
set. One lucky pass or blocked kick
might do the trick.
All week Thornhill will drill that
point into his charges lest a turn
of overconfidence prove a wrench
in the cogs of Stanford's now-roll
ing red machine.

Otherwise Stanford's varsity
will be in A-number-one shape for
the Brons. Buck Shaw, Santa
Clara line coach and scout, who
made the trip to Washington on
the Stanford train to scout the
Indians, is of the opinion that
Stanford will be in altogether too
good shape Saturday.
After that affair up north last

lief that Stanford will overpower
Santa Clara easily if the Indians
play the same kind of ball they did
agajnst Washington.

Stanford off guard and stage an up

Stanford still has a lot of foot
ball ahead this season. It was with
that thought in mind, that Tiny
Thornhill unloaded his victorious
Stanford varsity yesterday noon
with orders to "report for prac
tice at 4 this afternoon," giving the
"red toboggan"—so named by Bob
by Grayson—little chance to slow
up before its next encounter.
And at 4 o'clock Tiny and his gang
started work for their game next

Saturday with Santa Clara. Fhst
job for Tiny was the filling of a
first-string vacancy at right guard,
where Larry Rouble is forced to take
a two-weeks lay-off with a cracked
knee cartillage.
Thornhill plans to use Bob Black
at. the guard berth for a while.
Black has been working alternately
with Adams on the other side of
the line.
Rouble's condition is still more or
less questionable. Dr. Wilbur at one
