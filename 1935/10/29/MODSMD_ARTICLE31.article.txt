# Supreme Court Defers AAA Cases
## Arguments To Begin On December 9 Mooney Petition Denied By High Tribunal; State Considers 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 28 (/P).—Ad
ministration hopes for a final deci
sion before Christmas on the consti
tutionality of AAA processing taxes
dwindled today when the Supreme
Court ordered the Hoosac Mills case
argued December 9.
Over-riding a government request
that the case be set for November
20, the justices complied with the
wishes of Hoosac Mills attorneys,
who contended the questions was
"too important to be crowded."
While it would be entirely pos
sible for the court to hand down
its opinion by Christmas even
after hearing arguments in De
cember, attaches said that would
be highly unlikely.
The court also:
Refused to reconsider a petition by
Thomas J. Mooney, serving life in
F-an Quentin Prison, asking the
court to review his conviction of
< omplicity in the 1916 San Francisco
Preparedness Day parade bombing.
Mooney's case is still pending in
st.?te courts.
Received records of proceedings
in New Jersey tribunals which re
sulted in a death sentence lor Bruno
Richard Haupmtann, convicted of
kidnaping and murdering Charles A.
Lindbergh, Jr. This was routine ac
tion preparatory to asking the high
court to pass on the conviction.
Government lawyers had express
ed hope for early arguments on the
Hoosac Mills case so that a decision
might be handed down before Con
gress meets in January. Another
reason for the attempt at speed was
found in the impounding of process
ing taxes—imposed to pay farmers
for reducing or abandoning acreage
planted to basic crops — through
lower court injunctions.
The other pending New Deal case
involves the Tennessee Valley Au
thority Act. Fourteen preferred
stockholders of the Alabama Power
Company contended the legislation
was unconstitutional in a suit in
volving the government's right to
purchase transmission lines to cany
power sold to municipalities. The
circuit court of appeals at New Or
leans upheld TV A.
