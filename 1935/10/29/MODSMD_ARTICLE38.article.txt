SAN LEANDRO, Oct. 28 (/P). â€”
Police launched a frenzied search
late today for 7-year-old Shirley
Nicholson, reportedly kidnaped on
her way home from school today.
Persons who said they witnessed
the episode informed officers they
saw a man ask the child if she would
like a ride home and then take her
into his green sedan.
Instead of stopping at the child's
house, only three blocks away, the
car continued on in the direction ol
Hayward, police were told.
Copra and cocoa are the staple
exports of the Samoan islands.
