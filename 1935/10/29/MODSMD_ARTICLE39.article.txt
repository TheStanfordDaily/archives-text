I The Chaffie Staffie, Sirrahs:
If it is true that there is anything j
! on the Chaparral staff besides rub- ,
ber bands and glue pots, as you
claim, in your illuminating (gas)
communication to The Daily of Oc
tober 28,' inst. (Postum), the Daily
staff will engage you in single com
bat this Satiddy afternoon next.
Hired Thugs
If you have no men, as we claim, I
we will be glad to engage your
women's manager, office boys, and
hired ihugs.
We note in your article that you
' state: "We of the Chaparral staff,
: sound of mind and body . . ." which
is very true. For thirty years noth- j
ing has been in the minds of Chap
pie men but sound. The country is
fundamentally sound. Your hu
' mor is fundamentally sound. You
were wired for sound, but some
where there was a short circuit, and
i you blew a fuse. Now there is noth
! ing but refuse all over your filthy
| sheet.
'We'll Lugibrate Them'
We likewise note that you sign
your communique, "Lugubriously."
That is well taken, for the Daily staff
will put the skids under you and
lugibrate them. If it were Wash
ington we would wax them, but for
lugs there is only one thing to do:
lugibrate.
In short, if you still are fool-hardy
; and fancy free, and are foolishly un-
I afraid, we accept your kind invita
j tion to defeat you in a football game
i next Saturday afternoon between
I the halves of the Santa Clara game
and so forth.
