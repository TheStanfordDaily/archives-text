# Bradbury Talks On Electricity
## 
### 
Electricity is about us all the
time, in fact, there are 40 million
electrified particles, or ions, in each
cubic foot of ordinary air, stated
Professor Norris E. Bradbury on the
Stanford Radio Hour last night.
These are produced, he explained,
by two distinct phenomena.
The most powerful of ihcse is the
normal radio-active content of all
soils. These particles break down
and disintegrate and the electrically
charged atoms are given off into the
air. The second means of produc
tion is the cosmic ray.
As a result of these electric par
ticles the earth is charged to the
amount of about a million volts so
that each individual on the earth
is himself charged with this same
amount with respect to space.
Dr. Bradbury also explained the
causes and results of thunder
storms, and commented that there
is an estimated number of 44,000
storms and perhaps a hundred
flashes of lightning every second.

As a result of these electric par
ticles the earth is charged to the
amount of about a million volts so
that each individual on the earth
is himself charged with this same
amount with respect to space.
