optimistic than usual as his Indian
water polo teams began practice
yesterday for a return engage
ment with the San Francisco Olym
pic Club thi.s week-end.

men Friday evening in the O.C.
pool. The second Northern Califor

line-up he used against the Club

header. He was definitely pleased
with this team, shaken-up from the
previous week, which defeated the
Winged 'O' squad 3 to 2 after hav
ing won from the Trojans, 13 to 2.
Larry Pringle's record-breaking
swim in the Encina pools Saturday
did much to add to the glory of the
week-end activities as far as aquatic
sports are concerned. The flashy
yearling streaked through the waters
to a new American 50-meter record
of 26.5 seconds. Henry Godman,
Alec MacKenzie, and Eill Lhamon,
who followed Pringle to the finish
line, all bettered the previous mark
of 27.2, in the opinion of Thornton.
