PORT AU PRINCE, Haiti, Oct. 28
(/P). â€”Belated stories of how whole
towns vanished under flood waters
tended tonight to confirm estimates
that as many as 2,000 persons per
ished or were missing in the hurri
cane which ravaged Haiti's southern
peninsula last week.
Mountain streams, emptying near
Jeremie and Jacmel, wrought hid
eous damage, these reports indicated.
Flood waters of the River Anse,
near Jeremie, were reported to have
wiped out the town of Marfranc,
with many of its 500 inhabitants
drowned.
