GET ON THAT
RED TOBOGGAN
"Climb on that Big Red Tobog
gan!" Bobby Grayson invented that
i phrase just after the ball game hist
Saturday and all the way home that
was the password among Stanford's
tribe of mighty happy Injuns.
The old Pullmans fairly rocked
with joy coming back from Se
attle. And a couple of Stanford's
I men took a lot of razzing from
their fellow victors. But no one
cared 'cause Stanford was on "that
big red toboggan."
If you happen to hear them call
ing for "fifty yard-line Black," or
| "run for that train Chooch," you'll
know why. It's all like this.
During the heat of that great ball
j game, Bob Black was slumped on
the Stanford bench hoping for a
chance to get in. Suddenly he heard
1 Tiny speak his name —"Go ahead
Black." He fairly flew off the bench,
| starting racing up and down in front
of the Stanford team, warming up
j for the fray.
But then it happened. Mr.
Black's toe caught on the 50-yard
line marker and Stanford's tackle
proceeded to take the most beau
tiful header that citizens of the
Northwest will see for many a day.
Bob lit right on his face in a pile
of Stanford helmets. And the Stan
| ford team, on the bench, proceeded
| to forget all about the ball game
momentarily to laugh themselves
nearly dead. But that wasn't all.
Black came out of the pile all
right with a helmet on his head and
started out on the field. But he'd
forgotten to take off his sweat shirt.
About half way out he realized that
fact, started tugging it off over his
j head. But it wouldn't come.
So off came the helmet, and
finally the shirt, and then back
went the helmet again. All the
while some 40,000 Washington
ians watched the struggle with
tears of laughter in their eyes.
| Bob finally got into the game,
though, and showed 'em a thing or
j two about football playing.
CHOOCH ALMOST
j MISSED THE CIIOO-CHOO
Most everyone knows Choo-Choo
Tsoutsouvas. Well, Chooch almost
didn't get back to the Farm. And all
because of a couple of ice cream
cones.
| It happened Sunday night when

the train stopped for a few min
utes at some little jerkwater villa
in Northern California. A gang
of fellows were sitting around
playing the milder games of
chance (no high stakes, of course)
and someone suggested that
Chooch jump off and get ice cream
cones for the fellows.
Well, Chooch, being an obliging
fellow, climbed off, tore up the one
main street to a drug store and gave
his order. And about that time the
train pulled down the track about
a mile to switch off a couple of cars.
Our worthy third-string center,
already inside the store, turned just
in time to see the train dipping out.
With a handful of cones in hand he
hot-footed it out the door, sped
down the street, jumped on the
train while the storekeeper just
watched the "madman" and cussed
the guy that ran out without paying.
Chooch had to run hard to catch
the moving train but finally he
caught hold and swung aboard.
"This is the Stanford train, isn't
it?" he asked the first porter.
"No, sar, dis ain't de Stanford
(rain, mister," was the answer.
So Chooch jumped off the speed
ing car again, sprawled beside the
track, left some skin off his knee
where he'd fallen.
About that time he met one of
the switchmen, who informed him
that Stanford's train was just down
the track a ways cutting off some
cars; that it would soon be back.
Chooch didn't quite faint.

well and helped win the ball

The train stopped on the summit of
the Cascades in Southern Oregon
and all hands turned out for a stretch
in six inches of snow. Tiny wasn't
hit—there's still many a day of stiff
