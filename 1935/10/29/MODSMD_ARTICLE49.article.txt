Preparing for their game with the j
San Jose State frosh Saturday, but j
with their minds primarily on the '
Bear Cub tussle a week later, Stan- ,
ford's yearling football team en
caged mainly in signal drill yester- j
day. The Papooses scrimmaged a ,
little under the lights at the end of
the session, but. took things easy on |
the whole after their hard game with ;
the San Mateo jaysees.
Today, tomorrow, and Thursday, i
the plans of Jimmy Bradshaw and
his coaching staff call for scrim- j
mage as closely similar as pos
sible to game conditions. The
Cardinal '159 griddcrs should have
little trouble with the Spar
tans, but must be at their best in i
the Little Big (iame on Novem

halfback yesterday with the first j
string, in place of Pete Fay. Irv j
Cummings was at right end, Andy j
Stojkovich's usual position. Neither
of these changes necessarily means
anything as far as Saturday's game
is concerned.
WaJly deWitt tossed short south- 1
paw passes over center to various
backs and ends in most of the
plays practiced yesterday. The
lateral-forward pass from Bill I
Kirsch to deWitt to Fay, which
was worked on last week, failed
the one time it was tried against 1
San Mateo, and will probably be
discarded.
San Jose's frosh lost to the pow- !
erful Santa Clara first-year men I
by a 35-0 score Saturday, and
should not cause Bradshavv's eleven j
too much trouble. Earlier in the I
season, the Teachers were defeated
by College of the Pacific's year- j
lings, 14 to 0, and showed little be
| sides a triple-threat fullback, Zed- i
