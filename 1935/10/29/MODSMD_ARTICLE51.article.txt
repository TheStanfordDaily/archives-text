# "Let the Winds of Freedom Blow"
## Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily Member of the Associated Press Ignorance Plea in Farm Traffic Court Would Be Cut Out by Codifying Laws 
### 
In a statement in today's Daily, A.S.S.I'.
President Wally Brooke enumerates some of
the problems that handicap Men's and Wom
en's Councils in their efforts to prevent the
recurrence of deaths that annually result
from accidents concerning Stanford students.
These diflieulties of enforcement are even
more numerous, however, than Brooke indi
cated. Two-thirds of the feminine trallic vio
lators, when hailed before Women's Council,
have pleaded ignorance of the specilic viola
tion they were charged with. This average is
slightly lower among men students, but the
fact remains that Stanford's laws, slightly
different from state regulations, are not
known to the entire student body.
The two councils, slightly disgusted willi
more speeding and trallic congestion this year
than before, are levying stiller lines and more
severe penalties for violations, and some of
the offenders have a reasonable claim when
they complain that they did not know 'they
had overstepped the bounds.
A complete codification of the laws, as they
actually are enforced by the student councils,

would eliminate this ignorance plea and leave
no question in Farm residents' minds, thus
placing the burden of responsibility on the
student body. The laws should be accurately
organized, published, and made available to
all drivers under jurisdiction of the campus
la,w-enforcement departments.
Most of the regulations are enforced on a
common-sense basis, and are thereby made
self-evident; some obscure rules, however,
would never occur to the average student
until he had been arrested for a violation.
Among these more obscure laws are the
rulings pertaining to parking. The campus is
fairly well marked, but there are many un
marked "No Parking" areas that students
could locate only by means of printed descrip
tions of these taboo spots.
If these trallic laws, localized to suit specilic
Stanford problems, were codified, published,
and distributed to all student drivers, Men's
and Women's Councils would be relieved of
the nuisance of listening to ignorance pleas,
and the campus generally would be put on
guard against violations.
