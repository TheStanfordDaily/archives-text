### 
Of direct interest to at least four Stanford
swimmers is a statement by Avery Brundage,
chairman of the American Olympic Commit
tee, that "positively there will be teams repre
senting the United Stales in the 1930 Games."
These four swimmers — Larry Pringlc, a
freshman who shattered the American 50-
meter record Saturday, and Henry Godman,
Alec Mackenzie, and Bill Lhamon, all varsity
men who followed Pringlc so closely that they
100 unofficially bettered the national mark
all will be candidates for the American Olym
pic team; the United States delegation un
doubtedly will include many Stanford names.
In the meantime, another wrench was
thrown into the Olympic boycott movement
when Helene Mayer, noted German-Jewish
fencer now teaching at Mills College,- accepted
an invitation to join the German Olympic
team.
Mr. Brundage hit home with his remarks
that "the Olympic Gaines belong to the ath
letes and not to the politicians," and "the
sportsmen of this country will not tolerate the
use of clean American sport as a vehicle to
transplant Old World hatreds to the United
States."
