There is a certain Roble gal, whose principal line
of conversation consists of her boy friend back home
I and her diamond ring. Last year the boy friend back
| home was an unassuming lad, but with noble quali
ties. This year, however, she returned to school with
a totally new story and a new boy friend. The new
man was an aviator, who was supposed to be up in
the air over her, and took her into all kinds of dives.
However, the Roble chorus discovered that it was the
same ring. When queried, she admitted that such was
the case, but explained that she always bought her
own diamond rings so she wouldn't have to give them
back.
The time-keeping system at this University is run
on the Independent Study Plan. The Firehouse
whistle has a way of going off all by itself at all
hours of the day and night. The Firehouse laddies don't
know whether there's a fire ol - a weenie roast. The
musical notes usually chime in about five minutes
later. The library clocks give a hop and the students
jump and jitter two minutes afterward. But the
clock in Wong's Kitch is the only infallible time-piece
in school. The hands always mysteriously move around
to 12:15 when the chops are done.
The tremendous rooting section of 20 pieces that
cheered on the Injuns to their triumph over the haws
kies performed a neat little trick on the Washington
mushers. In order to amplify their vocabulary, a
couple of local Alpha Delts rented a red and white
fire bell from the Seattle Fire Department.
Now, the Washington rooting section has a sort of
1 a siren that they use to simulate the roar of the hus
kies. So whenever the Washington rooters started their
siren, the Stanford men belabored their bell. The
result was that eveiyone expected Ed Wynn to appear
on his old gray mare.
This toasted the Washingtonians to a crisp. After
the game, a wandering band of the northerners moved
in on the hell and wrested it from the persons and
the possession of the Stanfordites. But the joke is on
them. The roving cattle police, as agents for the fire
department, are already moving in on the v/andering
Huskies.
May wo remind our unseen and unseeing audience
that: Familiarity often bleeds contentment?
