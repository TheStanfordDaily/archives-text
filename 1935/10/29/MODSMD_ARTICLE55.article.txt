# Films Give Opportunity To See Team in Action
## 
### 
From the regions of the "Vox Campi" comes
the suggestion that movies of Stanford games
he shown to the student body, instead of re
stricting the showings to the team and limited
groups as has heen done in the past.
According to present plans, films of the
Washington-Stanford game will be shown
this Thursday in the Little Theater. Ex Com
mittee, moreover, intends to take up the mat
ter of regular showings in tonight's meeting.
From that committee may come the stimu
lus toward giving the student body a privilege
that is rightly theirsâ€”the opportunity of
seeing the varsity in action on an opponent's
field in the movies.
