PLATO KNEW US
As present day Americans . . . inheritors of democ
i racy . . . we the people are a crotchety lot . . . taking
j freedom as authority to do this and that with un-
I restrained abandon.

Smooth-pated Plato, sage of 347 8.C., knew the
; vagaries of humans so well and the inevitable form
j which a democratic state must take, that he was able
| to describe a typical American just 2400 years in
| advance. Said he:."An overweening youth who gives
( himself unrestrainedly, now to this, now to that,
| desire; who now takes up business, then wants to
1 play statesman, now wishes to go to war, and then,
| recumbent upon the bear skin, wishes to philosophize
j —such a life, without order, standard or duty, he
j calls free and happy; and many will admire a youth
j and regard him as an adept* in the 'fine art of liv-
I ing'—this is the character of the democratic state."

Strangely but truly, the Grecian philosopher seems
j clairvoyant-like to have not only tagged Mr. Babbitt
! of the U.S.A., but to have characterized Mr. Babbitt's
! sons in countless American universities.

Nothing could be more democratic than the ordi-
I nary college, wilh the president acting as (he supreme
I court, the rules of the university as the Constitution,
the Associated Students as congress, and classes as
! the medium of individual enterprise. And in this aca
demic republic "overweening" youth really outdoes
itself in living up to Plato's definition.

The freshman enters college confident he is capable
I and destined to excell in any number of callings. He
takes a bit. of history, biology, English, psychology,
| hygiene, getting an abundant smattering of knowl
i edge with just enough of one subject to get. a degree,
i He takes up studying seriously, then decides to go
i out for a spoi't, now wishes to play campus politician,
I and finally decides, perhaps, to be a social light and
scraps everything to get his name in the society
columns.

Such a life, to use Plato's own words, is cer
tainly without order or standard, but it is undisputably
free and happy. And undoubtedly many will describe
j a person who lives it as one who takes advantage of a
j "full university life."

Plato's forecast was accurate; perhaps his philoso
j phy also was true. Perhaps we, the "overweening
1 youth," could do with more purpose and standards,
more desire to follow a definite course to a fixed goal,
j and with less fleeting freedom and happiness along
| the way. —John McClelland
