# CAMPUS FOOTBALL MOVIES

| The Editor, Sir:
Here's my idea: Moving pictures
I of Stanford football games and other
l bay region games should be shown
to a Stanford audience.
In San Francisco, the "Roos Bowl"
' is showing bay region games daily.
' I know that Roos Bros, are willing
to show the films at night just for
i the asking. Why can't we see them,
I say, for an hour or two a week?
Two benefits to the students
| should accrue. Farm fans will be
| able to see plays as they actually
i happened and enjoy their rehash
ing; incidents that were missed at
| the game may be recaptured. Sec
j ondly, when showing pictures of
| other teams in action, students may
I learn the style of play of future op-
I ponents, how they use it, and when
| to expect it.
If the football team can see pic
; tures for scouting pui poses, why
I can't we see them for pleasure and
the above reasons? Why can't wt
see if U.C.L.A. was offside on that
| touchdown play or whether Olson
| deliberately kneed Alustiza or not.
These examples are perhaps wrong
{in the assumption that these fouls
i were committed—but at any rate wc
want to see it for ourselves. Let',
have some action, and let's see all
the games via the cinema from the
beginning of the season to the end.

We're trying out this idea Thurs
day night.—Ed.
