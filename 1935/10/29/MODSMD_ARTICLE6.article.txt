WASHINGTON. Oct. 28 </P).â€” A
decision on the amount of the gov
ernment loan on the 1935 corn crop
within 48 hours was projected to
day as AAA officials studied the
question behind closed doors.
Authoritative- sources said the
loan probably would be 40 or 45
cents a bushel. The 1934 loan was
55 cents a bushel.
Official returns from Saturday's
national corn-hog referendum pil
ing up at the Agriculture Depart
ment indicated heavy majorities
favoring a new adjustment program.
