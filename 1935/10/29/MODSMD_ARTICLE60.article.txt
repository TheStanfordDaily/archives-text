# NOT A BAD IDEA

### 
The Editor, Sir:
! I have a suggestion that might
help the Daily's readers to keep
track of future campus aclivities in
an easier' manner than is at present
possible.
Readers now glean articles con
cerning athletic meets, social and
< club affairs from many stories on
several pages. The essential facts
of event, date, place, lime, and price
they must remember. Some of these
stories they may miss completely.
Therefore, I suggest a short double
column feature, entitled "The

I Week Ahead," be printed in some
; conspicuous place every day. This
j running story should contain the
j above stated facts with possibly
; some necessary added notation. It
I should include everything scheduled,
i This campus date column should not
; displace any news event story; it
. should be a handy supplement.
