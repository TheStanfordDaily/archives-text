I The Editor, Sir:
i Too many people on this herenow
; campus take themselves too serious
i ly. Witness the recent uprising
j against the Ed's notes at the foot of
] various frothy campus opinions,
j Anybody who wants to foam at
! the mouth in the public prints
j should have his ego deflated once in
: a while.
No doubt many join me in getting
! a boot out of your "flippant" re
| marks. Keep 'em where they're
: needed and don't let these complain
, ing contributors back you into a
j corner.
A Friend in Need
