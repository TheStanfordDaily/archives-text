"DAItK ANGEL"
At the F«ix Stanford
A Merle Oberon emerges
from her chrysalis of slant
eyed siren roles to surprise
as a clean, wholesome Eng
lish girl, cast opposite Frederic
March and Herbert Marshall as the
two English army officers, chums
since boyhood, and each in love
with her.
The picture is a forthright senti
mental romance that sustains beau
tifully except for one or two scenes
in which it is handicapped by need
lessly trite dialogue.
After loving both men all her
life, Oberon chooses March when
war duty takes both to the front.
Prevented by chance from marry
ing before his departure, she ac
companies him to his point of em
barcation for a honeymoon without
benefit of clergy. Their scene of
parting is one of the most poignant
in the picture. There's not a dry
eye in the house.
At the front, Marshall, com
manding officer, refuses March a
leave, forces him to go on a recon
noitering party on which he is
blinded, captured. Marshall and the
girl, hearing nothing of him, both
believe him dead.
March returns to England but
avoids his former friends, not wish
ing their pity, and becomes a fam
ous writer of children's tales. Mar
shall, however, discovers him and
brings Oberon to his house. In a
smash finale, March fools both into
believing him perfectly normal, but
makes a small slip as they are about
to leave, and gives himself away.
Only directorial slip: Oberon's
hands in the honeymoon parting
scene.
Also on the bill is James Barton
in "His Family Tree," a C picture
about an Irishman who comes over
from the old country to find his son
gone highbrow, running for mayor
of his adopted town. Pa finally gets
him elected.
