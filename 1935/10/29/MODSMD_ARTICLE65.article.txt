BILLY ROSE, the Mud Mahout
of Broadway, has finally gotten
around to opening "Jumbo," the new
show that merges circuses and
dramas, retaining all the worst fea
tures of each. After the "Jumbo"
idea, even his wife, Fannie Brice,
admits he's crazy.
But not so crazy is his idea to 1
keep "Jumbo's" tunes off records i
and radios. That will prevent them
from being played to death. And
will also make them that much more
valuable to the new Texaco radio
program, starting tonight at 6:30 on
KPO, which will present a radio
version of the new Rose show, con
tinued from week to week.
DU PONT is developing a new I
cellophaneb ase film, said to give j

sound-on-film phonographs to sell
for about $100 that will be twice as
good as presents phonos, according
to DuPont engineers.
