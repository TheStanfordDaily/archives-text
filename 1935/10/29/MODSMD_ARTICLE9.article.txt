# Enlarge Plans Of Peace Meet
## Committee Will Discuss Safety Campaign 
### 
Armistice Day Peace Assembly,
planned by Ex Committee at its
session last Tuesday, will be ex
panded to include round table dis
cussions in the afternoon, according
to present indications.
The group will consider tonight
whether the International Com
mittee will help with plans for the
program, and whether suggestions
received from the National Stu
dents' League should be accepted.
Jean Anderson, assisted by Bryan
Moore and Adrenne Johnston, will
be in charge of arrangements. They
will submit a report to the commit
tee tonight.
Granting of dates this quarter
has resulted in several conflicts.
Organizations have been granted
Tuesday dates, with the result that
attendance at the lecture series has
fallen off. Ex Committee will con
sider, discuss, and formulate defi
nite policies.
A request by The Daily that Ex
Committee help in the "Drive Care
fully" campaign will be brought up.
Editor Bob Jones is asking co-opera
tion of the group in putting over the
campaign on the campus.
