portunity to see the Indians in ac
tion has been restricted to the
team itself and to B.A.C. officials.
Taken by the official B.A.C. pho
tographer who accompanied the In
dians to Seattle, and rushed to San
Francisco by a special plane, the
films were developed Monday af
ternoon. They will be displayed for
the first time tonight when the foot
ball team and coaching staff views
the scenes at a private showing.
Ex Committee last night ruled
that motion picture showings of
Stanford football games be held
publicly in the future so that all
Farm students will have an equal
opportunity to watch the varsity
squad in action, even if the game
is played far from the home field.
In the debate, Jack Clark, Ruth
French, Marshall Dill, Joffre debate
niedal winner, and Mary Boggs will
settle once and for all whether or
not the prerogative of paying is fe
male or male. The official question
is "Resolved, that the girl should pay
her share of the expenses on a date."
All students are invited, Bob Gros,
student manager, announces.
