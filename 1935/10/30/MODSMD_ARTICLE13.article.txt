# Soprano Sings Roles, Tells Wagner Legends
## 
### EUNICE ENGELKE 
"We Americans snort and giggle,
! but we really don't laugh enough,"
declared Maud Fay Symington,
I American operatic soprano, in her
i second lecture on Wagner's "Nie-
I belungenlied" last evening in the
Assembly Hall.
"However," said Mrs. Symington,
! "the hero of the 'Ring is the es
isence of laughter. Siegfried portrays
all the sunlight, buoyancy, and cn
; thusiasm of youth."
During the tolling of the two
! operas, Mrs. Symington sang the
role of Brunhildc's awakening,
and witli the background of mu
sic provided l>> Alfred Ilurtgen at
the piano, gave the story of "Sieg
i fried" and "(iotlcrdamiiierung"

scene by scene.
'"The whole 'Ring' is just a fairy
tale for grown-ups," said the op
eratic singer, "employing all ihe con
ventional heroes, heroines, dragons,
and gods, but in 'Gotterdammer
ung' there is more of philosophy,
more poetry."
Wagner wrote this opera 22
years after he first began build
ing his ideas, and the death of
Siegfried and Rrunbildc mark the
composer's belief in the redemp
tion of the world through love.
The tone-color of the operas must
be especially noticed, remarked Mrs.
Symington, for Wagner's under
standing of this phase of composition
far exceeds that of any musician be
fore him.
