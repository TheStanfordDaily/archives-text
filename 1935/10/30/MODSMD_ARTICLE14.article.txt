# Ex Committee Rules Peace Meeting Out
## 
### ANNALEE WHITMORE 
Armistice Day will have no as- i
sembly, decided Ex Committee last
night. They concluded that the
Public Exercises Committee would
not allow a fifth assembly this quar
ter; that round table discussions
would probably be more effective j
anyway; and that Stanford was not |
particularly eager for a rampant j
demonstration of peace. All plans j
dropped.
FOOTBALL FILMS will be shown
Thursday evening in the Little The
ater, with Bobby Grayson explain
ing the slow motion plays and Phil j
Bernheim supervising the actual j
showing.
RAM'S HEAD FINANCES were '
exposed to public view by Presi- j
dent Winstead Weaver. "We want j
to sponsor the winter quarter reg j
dance because we have $5.05 in our j
treasury, and how can we pay for j
the plaques wc give at the Gaieties?" |
he queried.
Weaver pointed out that "Ram's
Head is the goat," as the organiza- !
tion sponsors the Gaieties every year J
without profit, and that their only
revenue is the $10 levy from each
new member, which Ram's Head
thinks are fine things.
Worst Made $85
Said Gros: That 18 organizations !
have a balance below $10, one even
owing a 33-cent total, and that grant
ing a group the dance merely be- 1
cause they are financially embar
rassed is a dangerous precedent.
"The worst dance we ever gave
made $85," he remarked.
"Then we'll put on a VERY poor
one," promised Weaver.
It was decided to let Ram's Head
sponsor the dance, taking off 60 per
cent of net profits and giving A.S.
S.U. 40 per cent, and that this policy
be carried out in the future.
Dates Granted
DATES GRANTED include S.A.E.,

November 15; A.T.0., November 15;
Kappa, November 16; Theta Xi, No
vember 27; Junior Prom, May 22;
and the English Club was asked to
apply for Wednesday, November 13, !
instead of Thursday because of the
Thursday showings of football pic
tures.
CARDINAL MINUTES were ap
proved, including their request that
Ex Committee reconsider its decision
to charge 75 cents for the Santa
Clara dance. Score one for the Cardi
nals—admission price will be $1, the
extra sum being necessary because
the orchestra for the Big Game
jolly-up will cost $66.
ADVERTISEMENTS of a piano
company will be allowed to appear
on dramatic programs, as requested
by Manager Rex Hardy.
FOOTBALL CHARGES, made by
a Long Beach paper, will be met by
an Ex Committee-approved letter,
drafted by Bob Jones denying
statements and asking an apology.
CIRCULATING LIBRARY, a non
profit plan proposed by A.S.U.C.,
v/ill not be installed. "It seems to
me," remarked Frank Fullenwider,
"that our library has cost enough so
that they could have fiction avail
able. Those books they have take
hours to find, and then a professor
has them." Fullenwider will serve
as a committee of one to adjust the
situation.
ORCHESIS' REQUEST for the
women's gym on April 2, for a
dance recital by Martha Graham,
was granted.
L.I.D. REPRESENTATIVES, en
i tering late, asked if they were ex
pected to co-operate with Ex Com
; mittee on the peace assembly. They
I were told that there would be no
I assembly. "Might, as well forget it
1 then," said the representatives.
"That's what, we thought,." said

Thursday showings of football pic

CARDINAL MINUTES were ap
proved, including their request that
Ex Committee reconsider its decision
to charge 75 cents for the Santa
Clara dance. Score one for the Cardi
nals—admission price will be $1, the
extra sum being necessary because
the orchestra for the Big Game
jolly-up will cost $66.
ADVERTISEMENTS of a piano

FOOTBALL CHARGES, made by
a Long Beach paper, will be met by
an Ex Committee-approved letter,
drafted by Bob Jones denying
statements and asking an apology.
CIRCULATING LIBRARY, a non
profit plan proposed by A.S.U.C.,
v/ill not be installed. "It seems to
me," remarked Frank Fullenwider,
"that our library has cost enough so
that they could have fiction avail
able. Those books they have take
hours to find, and then a professor
has them." Fullenwider will serve
as a committee of one to adjust the

ORCHESIS' REQUEST for the

L.I.D. REPRESENTATIVES, en
i tering late, asked if they were ex
pected to co-operate with Ex Com
; mittee on the peace assembly. They
I were told that there would be no
I assembly. "Might, as well forget it
1 then," said the representatives.
"That's what, we thought,." said
I Fullenwider, with finality.
Armistice Day will have no as- i
sembly, decided Ex Committee last
night. They concluded that the
Public Exercises Committee would
not allow a fifth assembly this quar
ter; that round table discussions
would probably be more effective j
anyway; and that Stanford was not |
particularly eager for a rampant j
demonstration of peace. All plans j
dropped.

RAM'S HEAD FINANCES were '
exposed to public view by Presi- j
dent Winstead Weaver. "We want j
to sponsor the winter quarter reg j
dance because we have $5.05 in our j
treasury, and how can we pay for j
the plaques wc give at the Gaieties?" |
he queried.
Weaver pointed out that "Ram's
Head is the goat," as the organiza- !
tion sponsors the Gaieties every year J
without profit, and that their only
revenue is the $10 levy from each
new member, which Ram's Head
thinks are fine things.
Worst Made $85
Said Gros: That 18 organizations !
have a balance below $10, one even
owing a 33-cent total, and that grant
ing a group the dance merely be- 1
cause they are financially embar
rassed is a dangerous precedent.
"The worst dance we ever gave
made $85," he remarked.
"Then we'll put on a VERY poor
one," promised Weaver.
It was decided to let Ram's Head
sponsor the dance, taking off 60 per
cent of net profits and giving A.S.
S.U. 40 per cent, and that this policy
be carried out in the future.
