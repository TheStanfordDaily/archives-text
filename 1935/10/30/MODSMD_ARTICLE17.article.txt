# Chappie Gets Ace Gridder for Classic Tussle with Daily
## 
### 
The Editor, Mam:
So you finally accepted our chal
lenge, huh? You can't imagine our
surprise. We are dumfounded! We
are flabbergasted! We are con
vulsed!
Perhaps it would interest you to
hear that Chaparral has enlisted the
services of an ace football player,
Rogo Drool, who will play in the
! game Saturdayâ€”on your side.
We felt that The Daily was too
I much an underdog under the pres
| ent setup, and for that reason we
I have indulged in this bit of charity.
We are paying all of Rogo's ex
l penses while here. He is arriving on
the next streamlined bathtub from
Portland, Maine. And the only thing
that prompted him in deciding to
! come here is the fact that he will
j have the great privilege of play-,
j ing opposite the Chaparral team.
! Please treat him nicely. He eats
grass.
Optimistically,
j jimcopp
P.S. We have ordered your coffins.
They will each contain a lily. We
j think it quite appropriate; hey?
