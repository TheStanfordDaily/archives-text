Daily, and Student Theater Com
mittee, and aided by Comptroller
Almon E. Roth, culminate today in

555, which was started in memory
of the war dead. Years went by.
Then a campus Theater Committee
was formed, and with the aid of
Chappie editorials started a sepa

The Daily took up the campaign,
and finally succeeded in combining

Comptroller Roth was consulted a£
to the possibility of building a theater
with the funds available. He con
sulted architects and decided that a
minimum of $400,000 would be
necessary. Two years ago, he says

non-income returning, seemed im
possible.
Student enthusiasm reached a
high peak when the student body

Union profits and finally made
construction possible.
"It seemed at times that plan;

comments Roth, "but with all oui
changing of ideas, we will finallj
