# Surveying, Marking Of Site Start Today On Campus Theater
## Parking Lots, Entire New Street Planned To Aid Traffic Congestion House To Seat 1550 Building Will Be Class 'A,' Earthquake-Proof 
### 
Parking lots, an entire new street,
and a structure measuring 260 by
219 feet, with a stage equaling that
of the Pasadena Community Play
houseâ€”all are features of the cam
pus theater, on which preliminary
construction starts today.
"There's nothing to see," warns
Comptroller Almon E. Roth. There
will not be a corps of steam
shovels early this morning, he says,
as bids are just being asked on
veying and marking of the site
the cxcavation job. But the sur
| will be well under way by this
evening.
Present plans, the third set drawn
up, show a theater seating 1550 and
a little theater with a capacity of
150. The building will be roughly
! T-shaped, with the theater in the
main section, the little theater in one
side, and work shops in the other.
Space for 744 Cars
Parking lots on each side of the
1 heater, each holding 300 cars, will
relieve traffic congestion. One can
also be used for parking near the
Quad, and the other during games
or rallies in the Pavilion. There will
j also be space for 144 cars diag
onally parked in the new street.
Work on the street, to be 50
yards wide, will begin in the near
future, says Roth, as it must be
used during construction. It will
run parallel to the street in front
of the Administration Building,
on which the theater will face.
Foundations will be terraced.
! That means that the front lobby will
be four feet, or six steps, above
ground level, while the rear one
will be eight feet above.
Wagner Supervises
One interesting fact is that John
Levers, who will assist Contractor
George Wagner as superintendent of
| construction, also supervised build
ing of the basketball pavilion, En
; cina Commons, Toyon, Branner, the
8.A.C., the Women's Gym, the new
Union, and Lagunita.
Bonfire builders at first feared
that the site of excavations would
be where they had planned to
build the pyre for the Big Game.
According to Co-chairman Bob
! Jones, the bonfire site is far
j enough up Palm Drive to be com
pletely out of the way of work
men.
Because the University is located
| on an earthquake fault,' it was found
| necessary to make the entire build
ing Class A construction, thus rais
ing its cost but making it absolutely
| safe.
The building will have a heating
system and air-conditioning; but,
, | says Roth, the finishing touch wiil
be "comfortable seats with ample
j leg room."
