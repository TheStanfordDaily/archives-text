# Mussolini Puts Nation on Six Months' Diet
## Dictator Limits Use Of Meat, Furniture In Economy Drive 
### 
ROME, Oct 29 UP).â€”Premier Mus
solini lined up Italy's civil popula
tion of more than 40 millions today
for a grim and sacrificial fight against
sanctions.
U Duce placed the country on a
six months' diet, instituting meat
restrictions, and planned other
economies in supplies such as paper,
furniture, light and heating used by
government offices.
A measure effective a week from
today restricts sale of meats so as
to reduce necessity of imports.
Butcher shops will be closed Tues
days. Sales will be limited on Wed
nesdays, and curbs were also put
on public dining. Restaurants may
not serve more than one meat or
fish dish at a meal.
Mussolini's sudden decision to act
before economic sanctions have been
imposed was construed in well in
formed circles as showing he takes
ihe league sanction plan seriously.
The wartime card system used
by other nations, such as bread
and meat cards, II Duce rejected
as needless. lie put his trust in
his Fascists to reduce consump
tion, asserting "one can rely on
self-discipline, already tested, by
the whole Italian people.''
II Duce today has 6,917,813 men,
women and children enrolled in the
Fascist organization.
