### 
SAN JOSE, Oct. 29 (JP). —A recent
i faculty ban on nude posing before
j art classes drew sharp protests to
day from art students \it San Jose
State College.
"Where dft they think we are
going to learn anatomy —at Min
sky's?" asked one angrdy co-ed. It's
a wonder they don't ask us to use
models dressed in bathing suits or
J mother hubbards.
"Our drawings look like cigar
I store Indians. It's a sacrilege to art
j —nothing else."
Meanwhile the ban remains in ef
fect—the faculty apparently oblivi
ous to the furore aroused among
campus Bohemians.
