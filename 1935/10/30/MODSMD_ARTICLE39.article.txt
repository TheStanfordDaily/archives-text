# Art Contest Sponsored By Quad Editor
## 
### 
A student art contest, first in Stan
ford yearbook history, was an
nounced yesterday by the Quad
through its editor, Don Hanson.
Winning entries will fill the open
ing view section of the 1935 Quad.
"Stanford artists have not received
adequate recognition in the "past,"
said Hanson. "By this new compe
tition idea the Quad hopes to put
their work before the entire cam
pus as well as to make the annual
more strictly a student publication."
Contest entrants will draw sketches
of campus scenes and the best, to be
judged by members of the art de
partment faculty and Hanson, will
appear in the 193G book. Free
Quads will be awarded the winners.
Interested artists are requested to
get complete contest details from
Edward M. Farmer in the Division
of Graphic Art.
