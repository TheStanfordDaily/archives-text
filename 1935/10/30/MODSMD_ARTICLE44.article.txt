# Alustiza Goes To City Today For Operation
## Rouble Goes to Hospital; Cuneo Out for Week; Hamilton To Rest 
### Herb Diamond 
Today Frank Alustiza, Stanford's
injured backfield star, will be taken
tp a San Francisco hospital where he
will undergo an operation for the
retinal tear in his eye.
Such were the orders of Drs.
Blake Wilbur and Fritz Roth, who
have peered into Alustiza's optic
several times during the past week
and diagnosed his injury.
The "Owl-Eyed Basque" has been
allowed to be up and around the
hospital, although he has been
warned to keep out of the direct
sunlight and to avoid excessive
physical activity. While in the hos
pital, Alustiza has been wearing a
pair of opaque glasses equipped with
two tiny pinholes for admitting
light.
Rouble's Knee Hurt
Several of his team-mates got off
the train Monday to join Frank at
the hospital. Larry Rouble, first-

string right guard, was taken out of
the Washington game with a knee
injury that physicians are almost
certain is a cracked cartillage.
If this is true, Rouble will be out
of the grid line-up for the re
mainder of the season. Under no
circumstances will he see action in
the Santa Clara game Saturday.
Porky Cuneo, too, is slated to stay
on the bench during the Bronco
contest. However, his badly sprained
ankle should be in shape for the
U.S.C. battle.
Muscle Still Weak
Dr. Roth, team physician, is a
little wary about Bones Hamilton's
leg muscle. The pulled muscle still
needs plenty of rest, so Coach Tiny
Thornhill will not work Bones too
hard for the next few weeks.
Other members of the squad were
a bit shaken up as a result of their
tussle with the Huskies, but came
out for practice session last night as
usual. Perhaps the most painfully
injured was Joe Vigna, who left
several square feet of skin on the
football field in Seattle.
