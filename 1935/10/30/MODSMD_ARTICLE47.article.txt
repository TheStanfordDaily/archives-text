# Water Polo Team Seeks League Lead
## Wins in Final Tilts Would Give Indians at Least Tie with Bears 
### 
Varsity water poloists journey to
San Francisco Friday evening to
meet the Olympic Club squad in a
return match scheduled for 8:30
o'clock.
Because Stanford needs a victory
and because the Winged 'O' tankmen
"will be out to avenge their defeat
of last Saturday, this tilt should
prove a battle
If the Indians can down the
Olympians for the second time
and then defeat California on
November 215, they will be re
warded with no less than a tie
with the Bears for the Pacific
Association title.
The Bears must face the Athens
Club* twice, the Olympic Club
once, and the Indians once more
this season. They must emerge vic
torious in all the contests to claim
coast honors. And if the Berke
leyites should drop but one of the
tilts, the Indians will have a possi
bility of winning the Pacific Asso
ciation championship.
Coach Nort Thornton is highly
optimistic in estimating the
strength of his revised varsity
line-up that came through last
week-end to trounce the Tro
jans, 13-2, and then nosed out the
stronger Olympic Club, 3-2. Bol
stered by the new offensive break
which was used with success in
both games, the Farm mermen
hope to hand the Olympians an
other defeat Friday night.
The present Pacific Association
standings follow:
Won Lost Pet.

Stanford 4 1 .800
Olympic Club 1 3 .250
Athens Club 1 3 .250
