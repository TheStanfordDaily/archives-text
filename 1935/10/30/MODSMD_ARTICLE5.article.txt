### 
Campus luminaries expressed the
following opinion on tomorrow
night's debate on the question, "Re
solved, that the girl should pay her
share of the expenses on a date."
808 GROS, student manager:
"The question is not. too abstract
and it will prove entertaining," he
said. "I think that the reason for
the waning interest in debating is
that the students are not directly
interested in the topics. They are
generally too scholarly, and this type
of question will be an innovation."
WALLY BROOKE, student body
president: "Social conditions and
not a campus debate will decide
such a question, but I believe it will
prove to be an amusing topic."
MERCEDES BERGMANN, presi
dent of Women's Conference: "I
think that in the end such a ques
tion must be decided by individual
couples," she said. "It seems to me
that, what men think is more im
portant because under the existing
social customs ihey have to pay for
the dates."
JEANNE KEESLING, president
of Pan-Hellenic: "I think boys
should always pay for dates and I
think most girls agree with me,"
she said.
