TOKEN OF ESTEEM
FOR FRANKIE
Spokesman Tiny Thornhill went
to Frankie Alustiza's room Mon
| day night, talked about the game 9
hit, and then fulfilled a mission.
"Frank, the team wants me to
give you this."
From ThornhiM's pocket came a
token of esteem—a gold watch
with the inscription: "To Frank
from the Stanford Varsity."
1 Every man did his part toward
| that token and when Tiny handed
1 it to Frank the other evening it
j was as if every man had said,
j "Frank, you're my idea of a won
derful halfback, and a great guy."
Two weeks ago the movement
got under way to give Frank a pres
ent. Quietly, every man on the
team contributed, and the result,
that watch, was turned over to Tiny
to present to Frank.
And so it was that "Owl Eyes"
stood there before his Coach —
token of esteem in hand —flus-
; tered, confused, temporarily un
i able to squeeze out a word.
Then, after that first momentary
| silence, Frank spoke four words
I that indicated his appreciation more
j than could lines and lines of flow
! ered thanks.
j "Why, the damn fools."
ARE THE HUSKIES
SATISFIED?
Since the team returned from the
i great Northwest more than one
j Stanfordite has asked questions
i like these: "Do those fellows up
| there really think that Stanford de
served to win? Are they satisfied?
i We really had 'em beat, didn't we?"
Sure, we had 'em beat and every
j Washington man who saw that
I game knows that's the truth.
! Stanford was the best team Satur
day and the score indicates just
! about how much better Stanford
! was.
The fact that Tiny Thornhill pub
, licly announced that "Stanford was
lucky to win" does not indicate that
Stanford didn't deserve to win. He
I meant that with the score so close
; the big red outfit could have easily
' been on the short end despite its
j slight edge in power.
I But just a word to show how those

! fellows up north took it. Chick
; Franich, junior manager who made
| the jaunt, bet one of the Husky
i J.M.'s sweater against sweater that
i Stanford would win.
Well, after the ball game Mr.
Husky tore into the Stanford
dressing room, ripped off his J.M.
! sweater, threw it at Chick, with
I half a dozen words. "By golly,
I don't mind losin' to a club like
that."
That's the way everyone seemed
to feel; and Stanford knows that last
; week-end she defeated a fine foot
; ball team, but more than that, a
| group of truly good sportsmen.

"Frank, the team wants me to
give you this."
From ThornhiM's pocket came a
token of esteem—a gold watch
with the inscription: "To Frank
from the Stanford Varsity."
1 Every man did his part toward
| that token and when Tiny handed
1 it to Frank the other evening it
j was as if every man had said,
j "Frank, you're my idea of a won
derful halfback, and a great guy."
Two weeks ago the movement
got under way to give Frank a pres
ent. Quietly, every man on the
team contributed, and the result,
that watch, was turned over to Tiny
to present to Frank.
And so it was that "Owl Eyes"
stood there before his Coach —
token of esteem in hand —flus-
; tered, confused, temporarily un
i able to squeeze out a word.
Then, after that first momentary
| silence, Frank spoke four words
I that indicated his appreciation more
j than could lines and lines of flow
! ered thanks.
j "Why, the damn fools."
ARE THE HUSKIES
SATISFIED?
Since the team returned from the
i great Northwest more than one
j Stanfordite has asked questions
i like these: "Do those fellows up
| there really think that Stanford de
served to win? Are they satisfied?
i We really had 'em beat, didn't we?"
Sure, we had 'em beat and every
j Washington man who saw that
I game knows that's the truth.
! Stanford was the best team Satur
day and the score indicates just
! about how much better Stanford
! was.
The fact that Tiny Thornhill pub
, licly announced that "Stanford was
lucky to win" does not indicate that
Stanford didn't deserve to win. He
I meant that with the score so close
; the big red outfit could have easily
' been on the short end despite its
j slight edge in power.
I But just a word to show how those

! fellows up north took it. Chick
; Franich, junior manager who made
| the jaunt, bet one of the Husky
i J.M.'s sweater against sweater that
i Stanford would win.
Well, after the ball game Mr.
Husky tore into the Stanford
dressing room, ripped off his J.M.
! sweater, threw it at Chick, with
I half a dozen words. "By golly,
I don't mind losin' to a club like
that."
That's the way everyone seemed
to feel; and Stanford knows that last
; week-end she defeated a fine foot
; ball team, but more than that, a
| group of truly good sportsmen.
