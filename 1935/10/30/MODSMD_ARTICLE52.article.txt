# Cold Causes Gridders To Miss Passes
## Thornhill Has Backs Try Aerial Attack but Stiff Fingers Interfere 
### Bob Leland 
Near freezing weather last night
turned the football practice field
into an appropriate place for the
Big Red Toboggan to slide around,
i 'i iny Thornhill bad two sets of
backs and ends practicing offen
sive passing against a third set
I of backs. Everything would have
been line, only it was so cold that
neither Ernie Nevers nor Bobby
Grayson could grip the ball hard
- enough for good tosses. And the
i ends couldn't hold for the same
■ reason.
While the Grays worked on Santa
Clara plays in preparation for dum
j my scrimmage later in the week,
Thornhill ran two teams through
! an extensive signal drill.
On the first string were Monk
■ Moscrip, Woody Adams, Wes Muller,
Bob Black, Bob Reynolds, Dale
j Beedle, Keith Topping, Bill Paul
man, Jim Coffis, Joe Vigna, and
! Bobby Grayson.
Black, so far an understudy for
Adams, moved into the right guard
spot to fill the vacancy caused by
the injury of Larry Rouble, who
will he out at least until the Mon
tana game. Black was declared
j to have been the best guard on
the field against Washington.
However, the subject of reserves
j comes up, and then the trouble be
■ gins. Ralph Quails showed to good
! advantage in the U.S.F. game, and
Bob Mathews worked well in the
Washington fracas. Tom Callaghan
'stood in for Black last year when
Adams was out of several games,
but none have really been tested
; under fire.
Fred Williams, Doc Luckett, Tom
Collins, John Campbell, and others
also may get a chance to go places
against the Broncs, for undoubtedly
reserve strength will do for the In
dians what it did last year for Santa
Clara.
