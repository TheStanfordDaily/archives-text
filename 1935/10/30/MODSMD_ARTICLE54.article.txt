### BILL HULBERT 
In their first conference game of
the season, the frosh soccer team
will meet Menlo J.C. on the home
field at 4 o'clock this afternoon.
As a whole the team is very
green. However, the men have
improved rapidly and have been
showing pretty good team work in
practice sessions this week. The
Menlo squad is also handicapped
hy the lack of experienced men
and should be about on even terms
with the Papooses.
Lowe, center forward for the frosh
team, is the outstanding player on
the squad, showing up very well
yesterday in a scrimmage with the
varsity. At left half is Brownton,
who has shown almost phenomina!
improvement. This is his first at
tempt at the game, but he is one of
the mainstays in the yearling de
fense. Other players that should
show up well in today's encounter
are Barkan at right outside, and Mc
intosh at left outside.

Because the majority of the men
are new -at the jjaine, today's eon -
lest prohahly will he rather sloppy
in spots but it should show up the
abilities of some of the new play
ers. What the team needs more
Ihan anything else is the expe
| rience of competition and the
i game this afternoon will give them
J this if nothing else.

ty fair considering their lack of ex-
I perience. He expects to see a lot of
I improvement before the California-
Frosh game next month.
