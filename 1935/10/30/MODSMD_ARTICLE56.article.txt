# "Let the Winds of Freedom Blow"
## Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily Member of the Associated Press Theater Groundbreaking Today Fulfills Student Dreams of 15 Years' Standing 
### 
A dream that began to take form fifteen
years ago, today will commence to materialize
into a reality of concrete and steel as plans
and negotiations give way to actual ground
breaking on Stanford's War Memorial The
ater.
The theater has been made posibie by
the co-operation of four college generations
of students, by the Administration, especially
through diligent negotiating and arranging
by Comptroller Almon K. Roth, and by the
Hoard of Trustees who finally turned over
War Memorial funds to the project.
This enormous undertaking not only im
plies recognition of the place that dramatics
holds as a curriculum and extra-curricular
activity at Stanford, but it also will be a dis
tinctive, yet practical, war memorial, the pur
pose for which it was intended in the original
gift, and will he available and serviceable to
every student.
The finished product, scheduled for open
ing next autumn quarter, will be the most
modern and one of the most impressive cam
pus theaters in the country, and will represent
Stanford's most expensive construction proj
ect since erection of the original Quadrangle.
Early plans of the theater, the slight delay
in beginning its construction, and every phase
of the prc-groundhreaking negotiations have
closely followed the University's com mend
ably unique policy of being absolutely sure of

every detail, arranging for all eventualities,
and then erecting a structure that is insured
i against turning into a financial "while ele
phant" shortly after its completion.
Stanford has never bothered to build in
consequential structures that merely clutter
up the campus; instead, the University policy
has been to investigate all possibilities and
then create a durable building that will be
useful both now and in years to come — the
whole construction program has been on a
"big league" scale.
This policy is clearly exemplified by the
Stanford Golf Course, frequently spoken of
as the finest in the country, Lagunita Court,
! without peer among American college dormi
tories, the Union, and the Quad itself.
Now, after fifteen years of planning, the
Administration, noted for its thoroughness,
has announced its readiness to commence
actual work on the War Memorial Theater,
a project that will involve over half a million
dollars.
Everyone who luis had a part in the build
ing — from alumni who, as students fifteen
years ago, began negotiations, down to mem
bers of the Class of '39 who paid their first
dollar into the theater pool this quarter —
may now follow each phase of construction,
assured that the structure will be serviceable,
accurate, complete, and durable when its
doors are finally thrown open next October.

whole construction program has been on a
"big league" scale.
This policy is clearly exemplified by the
Stanford Golf Course, frequently spoken of
as the finest in the country, Lagunita Court,
! without peer among American college dormi
tories, the Union, and the Quad itself.
Now, after fifteen years of planning, the
Administration, noted for its thoroughness,
has announced its readiness to commence
actual work on the War Memorial Theater,
a project that will involve over half a million
dollars.
Everyone who luis had a part in the build
ing — from alumni who, as students fifteen
years ago, began negotiations, down to mem
bers of the Class of '39 who paid their first
dollar into the theater pool this quarter —
may now follow each phase of construction,
assured that the structure will be serviceable,
accurate, complete, and durable when its
doors are finally thrown open next October.
A dream that began to take form fifteen
years ago, today will commence to materialize
into a reality of concrete and steel as plans
and negotiations give way to actual ground
breaking on Stanford's War Memorial The
ater.
The theater has been made posibie by
the co-operation of four college generations
of students, by the Administration, especially
through diligent negotiating and arranging
by Comptroller Almon K. Roth, and by the
Hoard of Trustees who finally turned over
War Memorial funds to the project.
This enormous undertaking not only im
plies recognition of the place that dramatics
holds as a curriculum and extra-curricular
activity at Stanford, but it also will be a dis
tinctive, yet practical, war memorial, the pur
pose for which it was intended in the original
gift, and will he available and serviceable to
every student.
The finished product, scheduled for open
ing next autumn quarter, will be the most
modern and one of the most impressive cam
pus theaters in the country, and will represent
Stanford's most expensive construction proj
ect since erection of the original Quadrangle.
Early plans of the theater, the slight delay
in beginning its construction, and every phase
of the prc-groundhreaking negotiations have
closely followed the University's com mend
ably unique policy of being absolutely sure of

every detail, arranging for all eventualities,
and then erecting a structure that is insured
i against turning into a financial "while ele
phant" shortly after its completion.
Stanford has never bothered to build in
consequential structures that merely clutter
up the campus; instead, the University policy
has been to investigate all possibilities and
then create a durable building that will be
useful both now and in years to come — the
whole construction program has been on a
"big league" scale.
