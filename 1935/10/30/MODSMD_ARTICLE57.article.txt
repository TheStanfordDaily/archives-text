# "Cit" Teachers' Hopes Begin to Take Shape

Pounded home for years to "Cit" students
was Hie idea that the scientific method might
someday be applied practically in the social
field. Also presented to them was an idea
aptly phrased by the sage and historian,
.lames liryce, over forty years ago thus: "The
obvious weakness of government by opinion
is the difficulty of ascertaining it."
Scientific methods, long successful in the
mechanical field, are stepping out toward ful
filling their promise of possible social better
ment. A technique has been found which
seems to make possible unprejudiced and ac
curate finding of mass sentiment. This re
search technique which has developed out of
the straw poll system is coming into ils own.
(lobbied up by advertising men, the sur
vey technique was used to milk information
from consumers. Then Fortune magazine
saw the possibilities in the idea, turned it
toward opinion on national matters for maga
zine use.
Ten days ago, newspapers all over the
country began publishing National Weekly
Polls of Public Opinion, as released by the
American Institute of Public Opinion. This
body is purportedly non-partisan, and the in
formation it finds is released simultaneously
and without changes by papers of all hues.
No one who has not worked with the sur
vey technique can appreciate ils appalling ac
curacy if properly handled. By getting re
plies from a cross-section of the country
that is properly weighted in proportion to age,
se\, income, section, and political affiliation,
good surveys have been able to stay within
one or two per cent of actuality, as proved by
past check-ups. The haphazard results at
tributable to the old type straw poll which
relies on numbers alone for its accuracy are
eliminated.
Conductors of this nation-wide opinion
survey assure readers that the best techniques

I are employedâ€”ballots even going into every
eounty in the land. 11 the organizers he truly
unprejudiced, the results should he a great
step toward informing voters and the Gov
ernment alike as to the real feelings of the
: populace that they may lie guided thereby.
