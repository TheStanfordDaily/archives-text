Though Our Hashsash has carried on a missionary
campaign to democratize the freshman women, he
seems to have broken down rather severely in other
spots. There is a superior individual at the Theta
house who does not deign to speak to Wong's Chosen
People. If she wants seconds will she speak to a
hasher? Oh, no. She asks the gal sitting next to her
to convey the necessary information. Oh, woe! Oh,
woe! Thi.s is not Castilleja. This is Stanford Univer
sity, home on the range.
The Phi Sigs have been having no end of fun
lately. It so happened that little delicate, frilly gar
ments were mistakenly sent to their house instead of
the Alpha O house. By the time the Alpha O could
call to claim her valuables, the stags at eve had
dunked her frills all over the house. Naughty.
Last week's headline: "Plane Wrecked in Crash.
Ruth Nichols Burned.'' Well, you'd be too.
Our Hasher's OGeePeeU intelligence (IQ, do you?)
unit reports that within the past fortnight, a Stanford
woman has severed diplomatic relations with the
University for conduct unbecoming but not unbe
knownst. It seems that Stanford has a very efficient
bureau of missing persons, and once they start miss
ing, they remain missing.
This hand-to-hand combat stuff in the wilds of
Ethiopia has led to the following rules of warfare—
The Italian: "Haile!"
The Ethioppie: "Highlo! Put up your duce!"
Stanford's news-gathering organization is a tre
mendous and terrible one to behold. One news broad
caster in San Francisco reported yesterday's puny
brush fire as a gigantic conflagration, burning down
the Convalescent Home, while the Daily underplayed
it. It was not till 12 o'clock at night, in fact, that an
editor noticed that there was no story in the paper
on the fire. The officials cornered the reporter in
charge of the fire house detail.
"Oh, yeah." said the reporter, "I went over there
this afternoon but there wasn't a soul around."
