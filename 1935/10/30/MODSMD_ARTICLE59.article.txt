"MAKE IT A SIIOKT FREAK"
In newspaper lingo, a short freak is a short item
about a nutty occurrence. It is the category that much
college news fits and the category that most college
news must be made to fit.
Campus correspondents for city papers who are
momentarily about to die under the administrative
death glance, regard that first paragraph as a state
ment of bitter truth. It is the paramount rule of our
particular game: giving the public university life in
the way it has been taught to understand it.
* * » *
City editors cannot ask, but must demand college
news that is bright, scintillating, entertaining, and
mildly insane. That is the news that they will print and
pay for. It is the news we mustpresent if we are to hold
down our jobs.
The demand for such news is not arbitrary but is
based on a factual public market. Back of the city
editor, back of the circulation figures, is the typical
reader. Though she will not admit it, she would much
rather read about Mrs. Hoover and a fraternity fracas
than about a discovery of world-shaking importance
in the university laboratory.
Moreover, she wants to read about what nutty col
legians do every day, not once a week. It is up to us
to give Mrs. Average Reader her nutty stories as
daily fare.
* * * *
Paradoxically, these stories come from a place dedi
cated to the spread of reason and knowledge. They
come from a place that long ago stopped being the
playground of young idiots, if, indeed, it ever was
that. They are about not only young people, half edu
cated, but from old people, the most fully educated
men and women in the nation.
Mrs. Average Reader does not recognize that uni
versities are not nut-houses because she has never
been so told. To hold circulation, the national press is
willing to perpetuate an absolutely false idea, to wil
fully aggravate, often damn, institutions that play an
essentially noble part in human life.
* * * *
Upon the campus correspondent falls the work of
providing this written ignorance. He knows by ob
vious inference that dancing, drunks, and dames, stupid
pranks, sophomoric protests and utterances, make the
saleable kind of news. He knows that a college stu
dent killed by drunken driving is a big and gory story,
bigger and gorier by far than the same fatality to an
ordinary white-collar worker.
In his day by day work he must share between
loyalty to the idea of selling papers and loyalty to
his university. He must serve the mammon of circu
lation and Minerva.
He can only hope that some day the basic function
of the newspaper, giving true and significant informa
tion, will reassume its place as a journalistic virtue.

"MAKE IT A SIIOKT FREAK"
In newspaper lingo, a short freak is a short item
about a nutty occurrence. It is the category that much
college news fits and the category that most college
news must be made to fit.
Campus correspondents for city papers who are
momentarily about to die under the administrative
death glance, regard that first paragraph as a state
ment of bitter truth. It is the paramount rule of our
particular game: giving the public university life in
the way it has been taught to understand it.
* * » *
City editors cannot ask, but must demand college
news that is bright, scintillating, entertaining, and
mildly insane. That is the news that they will print and
pay for. It is the news we mustpresent if we are to hold
down our jobs.
The demand for such news is not arbitrary but is
based on a factual public market. Back of the city
editor, back of the circulation figures, is the typical
reader. Though she will not admit it, she would much
rather read about Mrs. Hoover and a fraternity fracas
than about a discovery of world-shaking importance
in the university laboratory.
Moreover, she wants to read about what nutty col
legians do every day, not once a week. It is up to us
to give Mrs. Average Reader her nutty stories as
daily fare.
* * * *
Paradoxically, these stories come from a place dedi
cated to the spread of reason and knowledge. They
come from a place that long ago stopped being the
playground of young idiots, if, indeed, it ever was
that. They are about not only young people, half edu
cated, but from old people, the most fully educated
men and women in the nation.
Mrs. Average Reader does not recognize that uni
versities are not nut-houses because she has never
been so told. To hold circulation, the national press is
willing to perpetuate an absolutely false idea, to wil
fully aggravate, often damn, institutions that play an
essentially noble part in human life.
* * * *
Upon the campus correspondent falls the work of
providing this written ignorance. He knows by ob
vious inference that dancing, drunks, and dames, stupid
pranks, sophomoric protests and utterances, make the
saleable kind of news. He knows that a college stu
dent killed by drunken driving is a big and gory story,
bigger and gorier by far than the same fatality to an
ordinary white-collar worker.
In his day by day work he must share between
loyalty to the idea of selling papers and loyalty to
his university. He must serve the mammon of circu
lation and Minerva.
He can only hope that some day the basic function
of the newspaper, giving true and significant informa
tion, will reassume its place as a journalistic virtue.
