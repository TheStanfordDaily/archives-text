# An Apology Demanded
## 
### 
With the approval of Ex Committee, the Daily today sent the following
letter to a Long Beach sports columnist who recently published a statement that
"it was not an eye ailment that forced Frank Alustiza to quit football. . . .
Because of 'bad blood' either Grayson or Alustiza had to go. Bobby was more
valuable so he stayed. That's why Alustiza suddenly became blind."
Mr. Art Cohn

Dear Sir:
Speaking officially for the Associated Students of Stanford
University, we wish to call your attention to the poor taste
and malicious nature of your article concerning two Stanford
undergraduatesâ€”Frank Alustiza and Bobby Grayson.
It will not be necessary for Stanford authorities to deny
your absurd claims, as you expected. To this University, the
obvious falsity of your allusions to "bad blood" and "dissen
sion" among team-members is self-evident.
Since your readers are not as close, however, to the facts
as we are, we challenge this false slur on the University, its
authorities, and its team. It should not go uncorrected.
In view of the fact that Frank Alustiza is to be operated on
today for a retinal tear, it is not too much for us to expect
an apology to the offended men and to the Associated Stu
dents, in addition to a printed retraction in your column.
Sincerely yours,
THE STANFORD DAILY
Bob Jones, Editor
