"BITTER SWEET'
At the Curran, S.F.
If your love of this excellent Cow-
I arc! operetta is so great that it can
1 withstand the onslaught of Evelyn
! Laye's off-pitch voice and Bartlett
Simmons' eyebrow - twitching and
| phoney accent, then see this pro
| duction.
But if you have never before been
i exposed to the poignant beauty of
! "Bitter Sweet," then please stay
: away. For this company does not do
j it justice.
In all fairness it must be said
| that the supporting cast is excellent,
the production lavLsh, and the music
' both sentimental and rousing. In
| fact, Mildred Rogers, who, as
Manon La Crevette, is given two of
the many songs, has a voice far bet
i tcr than the star's—it's good.
Further, to do justice to Miss
Laye, it must be said that she acts
the part well. She played the young
and romantic Sarah Millick with
; charming naivete, and the aged Lady
I Shayne with dignity.
But this reviewer winced at the
j off notes she hit and writhed as she
I murdered "Zigeuner," the most
! beautiful melody in the show.
; Yes, the production is good. Now
: if the leading lady only had a voice
I that true . . , !
