# 'Dark Tower' To Be Enacted Tomorrow Night in Farm Hall
## Phyllis Corson, Fred Clark Head Cast of Mystery Melodrama Seats Still on Sale Council To Give No Other Plays This Quarter 
### Suzanne Hammond 
"Dark Tower," the first mystery
melodrama to be presented at Stan
ford in recent years, will be enacted
on the Assembly Hall stage tomor
row evening at 8:30 o'clock. The
play is a Dramatic Council pro
duction and will be the only one
given this quarter.
The mystery presents an inside
view of the life of a "royal family"
of actors during a great crisis in
their lives. Jessica Wells, played
by Phyllis Corson, is about to
return to the stage after a three
years' absence. Owing to her un
fortunate marriage to Stanley
Vance (Charles Corker), whose
mental cruelty had brought about
her collapse, Jessica had been
forced into retirement.
Now, however, with the news of
Vance's death, Jessica has regained
her health, and "The s Dark Tower"
opens on the eve of her come-back.
The opening scene is one of great
rejoicing in the Wells household.
Damon Wells (Fred Clark) has
come from Hollywood to appear with
his sister, and their manager, Ben
Weston, played by Robert Garred, is
doubly blissful over a successful
season and his marriage to Jessica.
At this point fate intervenes in
the person of Stanley Vance, very
much alive. He has been in jail,
his habitual residence, under an
assumed name. At once he re
asserts his vicious influence over
Jessica, and all plans for her re
turn to the stage arc destroyed.
The family is desperate at this
turn of events. Jessica's aunt and
the family doctor conspire against
Vance, and Damon attempts brib
ery. Weston and Max Sarnoff, a for
eign producer, try to remove Vance
by purchasing his wife's interest in
the play.
Such is the situation in "The
Dark Tower." Enacted by a group
of thoroughly capable players, the
play presents great dramatic con
flict and is a fascinating tangle of
cross-purposes.
Tickets for the production are on
sale at the A.S.S.U. ofiice priced at
$1 for the downstairs center section,
75 cents for the side sections and
balcony center, and 35 cents for the
