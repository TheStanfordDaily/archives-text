# O'Neill Asks Students To Submit Skits
## 
### 
"We are urging all houses,
organizations, and individuals
to contribute more and new
skits for the Gaieties," Frank
O'Neill, Stanford dramatic di
rector, announced yesterday.
This material should be turned
in as soon as possible, he
added.
In this call for skits the fol
lowing rules have been sug
gested to writers by O'Neill:
avoid obscenity, scenes de
picting drunkenness, malicious
lampooning of campus figures,
and skits based on parodies of
popular songs.
A skit committee, of which
Dick Dawson is chairman, has
been appointed by O'Neill.
Members of the committee
will serve as continuity writers
for the show.
