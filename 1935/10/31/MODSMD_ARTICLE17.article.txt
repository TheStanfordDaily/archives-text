# Space Marked On Theater Site
## Wilbur, Roth Responsible For Edifice 
### 
Just when .steam shovels will first
dig into the theater site is uncer
tain; but students yesterday saw
surveyors marking off the 260 by
219 foot T-shaped plot, in the first
move toward actual construction of
the edifice.
Mainly responsible for the
building are Stanford's two ex
ecutive heads, President Ilay Ly
man Wilbur and Comptroller Al
mon E. Roth, cither of whom
could have vetoed plans when they
were first proposed, but without
whose guidance building would
have been out of the question.
Dr. Wilbur consulted with stu
dents, attended meeting after meet
ing with the official University ar
chitects, and gave his approval to
the plan at a Board of Trustees
meeting.
Comptroller Roth mapped out a
scheme of payment, which at first i
was thought an impossible task. He !
also aided in the preparation of
plans and went over blueprints in
an effort to reduce cost and still have
a worth-while structure.
Stan Beaubaire, last year's
editor of The Daily, was promi
nent on a student theater com
mittee which succeeded in col
lecting over $4,000. Marvic Kahn,
then student body president, was
instrumental in pushing through
the student body vote to pay a
dollar a quarter per student.
Phil Brown, Antialee Whitmore,
and Helen Ray were members of the
theater group which helped draft
plans and consult dramatic authori
ties.
