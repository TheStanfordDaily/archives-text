# Professor Lauded For Designing Morris Dam
## 
### JIM HURST 
| Professor Samuel B. Morris, now j
executive head of the Stanford Civil (
; Engineering Department, is the man |
; for whom the widely known Morris ,
; Dam near Pasadena was named.
As chief engineer and general
manager of the Pasadena Water
Department, Professor Morris
j lias been chiefly occupied for the i
past 15 years with the concep
tion and construction of this dam, :
coming to his new position at Stan
ford only this year, since the
completion of the dam.
Built in the canyon of the San
! Gabriel River to retain a portion of
Pasadena's water supply which
' would otherwise be totally wasted,
the Morris Dam was the first in the
1 United States to allow complete
| theoretical provision for resistance
! of earthquake shock. Fifteen per
cent more material was used in con
'■ struction than would have been re
quired without earthquake allow
| ance.
Since an earthquake fault passes
through (he dam. though there
has apparently been no movement
along it for approximately ten
thousand years, a joint has been
placed over the fault that will al
low a relative movement of the

two sections of the dam as much
as I! feet in either direction.
Research relative to shock re
sistance in the dam was conducted
at Stanford by Professor L. S. Ja
cobscn on a shaking table of his own
invention.
Careful planning and geological
investigation over a period of 10
years before construction was started
resulted in a remarkable minimum
of difficulties in actual construction.
A period of only 25 months elapsed
from the time ground was broken
until the five million dollar project
was completed. Yet the accident
record was so low that the manage
ment was extended special con
gratulations by the insurance com
panies.
After work had been started,
an agreement was made with the
Metropolitan Water District of
Southern California to use the
Morris Dam as a reservoir for
Colorado River water when the
Boulder project is complete. Thus
it will serve a dual purpose.
Originally named the Pine Canyon
Dam. the Morris Dam was renamed
for the engineer responsible for its
marked success shortly before it
was dedicated in May, 19P>4, by
Herbert Hoover.

Research relative to shock re
sistance in the dam was conducted
at Stanford by Professor L. S. Ja
cobscn on a shaking table of his own
invention.
Careful planning and geological
investigation over a period of 10
years before construction was started
resulted in a remarkable minimum
of difficulties in actual construction.
A period of only 25 months elapsed
from the time ground was broken
until the five million dollar project
was completed. Yet the accident
record was so low that the manage
ment was extended special con
gratulations by the insurance com
panies.
After work had been started,
an agreement was made with the
Metropolitan Water District of
Southern California to use the
Morris Dam as a reservoir for
Colorado River water when the
Boulder project is complete. Thus
it will serve a dual purpose.
Originally named the Pine Canyon
Dam. the Morris Dam was renamed
for the engineer responsible for its
marked success shortly before it
was dedicated in May, 19P>4, by
Herbert Hoover.
