Tonight is to be the first time that
the students as a body will have
seen official motion pictures of the
team in action, as formerly only the
team and officials witnessed them.
Bobby Grayson will discuss the
slow motion plays in order to give
the observers a clear picture of
the proceedings in Washington
last Saturday.
An official B.A.C. photographer
took the pictures and they were
rushed down by plane. Motion pic
tures such as there are expected to
be shown in the future as weekly
features, Ex Committee announced
Tuesday night.
