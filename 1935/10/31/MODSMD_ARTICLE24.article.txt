# Big Game Bonfire Plans Go Forward
## 
### 
Plans are rapidly materializing for
the Big Game bonfire, according to
Bob Hoover, co-chairman.
With its funds already allotted, the
committee has contracted with the
Southern Pacific for delivery of a
carload of old railroad ties from
Santa Cruz. An agreement also has
been made with the P.G.& E. for
delivery and erection of eight up
right poles early in Big Game week.
