# Rooters Attend 'Students' Day' This Afternoon
## Rally Committee Urges Retention of Spirit On Campus Pictures To Be Shown Hunt To Drill Varsity In Scrimmage Session 
### 
Today at 4:30 o'clock Stanford
holds its third Students' Day at
practice when Farm fans turn out to
see the "big red toboggan" tram
for the next bump in its slideâ€”Sat
urday's game with the Santa Clara
Broncos here.
Keith Topping in last Monday's
welcome home rally expressed the
team's feeling toward spirit shown
by the student body, when he said,
"I know that football players are
reputed to be big and dumb, but
nevertheless we do have human
emotions, and we do appreciate these
rallies."
Husky Hunt will drill the var
sity grid men in some new plays
in preparation for the Santa Clara
game. Williams, Luckett, Collins,
and other undergraduates, who
are to help form the nucleus of
next year's eleven, are beginning
to appear in the line-up, and can
he seen in action today on the
practice field.
The motion pictures presented to
the student body tonight will also
be given to stimulate student in
terest in the actual play-by-play
football executed by the Indians.
Phil Coghlan, Rally Committee
chairman, feels that the games to
come will be the toughest. He
says, "Even though the rooters
showed enthusiasm after the
Washington game, I think the big
gest and hardest of our games arc
ahead. The Rally Committee is
going to try to keep up this swell
spirit by giving the students big
ger and better rallies as the sea
son goes on."
Cheer-leader Dick Stark says,
"The quality of football played by
the Cards in Seattle certainly proves
to us that a team well backed by
the student body will fight much
harder for a victory." Stark fur
ther suggests, "Let's stay right be
hind them all llie way to the Rose
Bowl." The likelihood of our Rose
Bowl chances, of course, depends on
the outcome of the California-
U.C.L.A game next Saturday.
