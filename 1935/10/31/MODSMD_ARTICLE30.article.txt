WASHINGTON, Oct. 30 (TP)
President Roosevelt warned Amer
ican exporters today that the gov
ernment was keeping a careful
check on all shipments consigned to
Italy and Ethiopia.
The president's warning was
made in a formal statement after
Secretary Hull earlier in the day
reiterated forcefully that the pol
icy of the United States was to dis
courage business dealings with the
warring nations.
Declaring "this government is

determined not to become involved
in the controversy and is anxious
for restoration and maintenance of
peace," the president said:
"However, in the course of war,
tempting trade opportunities may
be offered to our people to supply
materials which would prolong the
war."
