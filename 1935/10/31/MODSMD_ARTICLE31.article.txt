### 
Stanford roughs may not
take beauty prizes, but the men
on the Berkeley campus are
equally lacking in masculine
charm, a recent survey by U.C.
co-eds shows.
A committee of women,
known as the Step Beauty
Pickers Setters, took a census
last week on the steps of Esh
leman Hall and came to the*
conclusion that the men of that
university are utterly lacking
in what it takes.
Each pedestrian of the male
species was regarded and class
ified by the Setters into one
of the following groups: Hon
eys, those whom God has
blessed in regards to anything;
Lily-dippers, those that talk
of the girls back home in Ven
tura; Panty-waists, the kind
one is usually forced to go out
with; and Gawd-awfuls, of
which there were a majority.
