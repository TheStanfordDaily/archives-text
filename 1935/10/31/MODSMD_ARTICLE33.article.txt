ATLANTIC CITY, N.J., Oct. 2D
j â€”A jury of ten psychologists, I
1 under the direction of the research '
foundation of the Association of
National Advertisers, shortly will !
take over the study of various ad
vertising copy testing methods, Ken
R. Dyke, newly elected chairman of j
the board of the association, said
j today.
Dyke, addressing the 300 dele
; gates to the national convention,
; said the study would cover all known '
types of tests.
"The work has already been start- ,
ed and is of great importance to the j
! advertising business which deals j
! primarily with the human mind, in
j the attempt to change people's at- i
j titudes toward certain products," j
Dyke said.
I. W. Digges, of New York, gen- !
eral counsel of the association, de- '
scribed in a paper, read by W. H.
| Leahy, of New York, a method by
which advertisers can protect them
selves from lawsuits and charges of |
stealing ideas. The method, Digges !
said, was received from an unso
licited source.
