# Press Offers War History by Russian
## 
### 
That the United States during the
World War had planned—but later
abandoned — a naval expedition
against Turkey and the Dardanelles
is revealed in "The Testimony of
Kolchak," edited by H. H. Fisher
and Elena Varneck, a Hoover War
Library publication just released
by the Stanford University. Press.
The book states that Admiral
Kolchak of the Russian navy came
to this country in 1914 to advise
the American naval authorities on
this proposed expedition, only to find
that the plan had been abandoned.
It is based on the testimony of the
Russian admiral before a Bolshevik
committee, into whose hands he had
fallen after the collapse of the Sibe
rian anti-Bolshevik government.
The new Golden Gate bridge will
be lighted by equally new sodium
vapor lamps.
