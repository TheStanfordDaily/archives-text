# WOMEN ALSO ACTIVE IN SPORTS
## 
### 
So much is heard about the Big
Red Machine and the various other
Indian teams that men on the cam
pus arc apt to be oblivious of the
fact that there are also women ath
letes on the Farm—some 700 of
them, in fact.
This year in particular women
are more active in sports than
they have ever been on the cam
pus. Ilockey, as usual, is the lead
ing sport in autumn quarter.
Class teams began their tourna
ment play yesterday. Fencing,
swimming, tennis, golf, and arch
ery are other sports vying with
hockey for popularity this quar
ter.
Intramurals for women have been
experimented with for the first time
this year, and the first round of
mural basketball completed last
night has already proven its suc
cess. The campus as a whole was
well represented in this tournament
with five sorority teams, four dor
mitory, four freshman, and three
teams from mixed living groups par
ticipating—l3o women in all.
"The season," says Marie Manchee,
faculty adviser, "showed that Stan
ford women are more than equal
to organizing and running their own
intramural season and in keeping
ideas of sportsmanship and friendly
play to the fore."

TRI-SPORTS DAY
YEARLY HIGHLIGHT

On Saturday approximately 75
Stanford women will journey up to
Mills College to participate in the
annual Tri-Sports Day with Mills
and California.
As intcrcollegiates for women,

on the coast, competition is in
terelass, with one of the four
combined classes of Mills, Cal,
and Stanford becoming the win
ners for the year. Class teams are
entered in hockey, golf, tennis,
swimming, archery, and fencing
events.
The sophomores and juniors ap
pear to have the best material among
the Stanford representatives. The
juniors have four fencers of out
standing ability in Birdie Boyles,
Mary Agnes King, Barbara Brenk,
and Beth Doyle.
They also have practically the
same hockey team which won the
Stanford interclass tournament last
year, and two leading tennis players
in Betty Pearce and Margaret
Diedrich.
Ellen Louise Schmidt should
score some points for the sopho
more classes in the diving events.
She has been getting pointers
Sunday afternoons from Roy Win
kelmann, frosh star, and is in
good form.
Cynthia Coonley should be a big
help to the sophs in the tennis and
swimming events, as should Sally
Weston in the archery and June
Bryant in the golf. Gerry Reed,
sophomore, will be the only Stan
ford rider in the gymkhana spon
sored by the Bit and Spur Hiding
Club of Mills. —Heenan
