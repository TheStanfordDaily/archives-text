# Varsity Gridders Practice Pass Defense
## Tiny's Team Plays Tough 'Bronc' Men Grays Oppose Regulars With Santa Clara Grid Tactics 
### Warren Breed 
Clipper Smith, impersonated by
Murray Cuddeback, and his able as
sistant and line coach, Buck Shaw
(Husky Hunt) sent their Santa
Clara "bronchials" against the Card
varsity last night in practice.
The "bronchials" were really only
the Stanford Grays, and they ran
through Santa Clara plays and
passes in order to prepare for the
Stanford varsity meeting with the
Broncs here Saturday.
Practice Pass Defense
Tiny thought it would be a very
fine idea to try passes against the
regulars, for three of the backtield
are new men and have not become
acquainted with the brand of trick
passes Clipper Smith teaches his
boys. Bill Paulman, Joe Vigna, and
Jimmy Coffis are the new ones,
Bobby Grayson the tried and true.
Cuddeback's eleven was captained
by Ernie Nevers, imitating Manny
Gomez, who is developing the So
brero pogo-pass lore, and who will
probably toss them Saturday. Chief
pass catchers were Earl Hoos, Walt
Chouteau, and George Bergman,
who were the Buttons, Finneys, and
Kaliskis of Santa Clara.
Gomez Threat
Gomez, who is rapidly becoming
a major Bronc threat, is carrying on
where the injured Patches Thomas
and Don de Rosa left off. It's the
same with the Indians—Coffis and
Vigna for Hamilton and Alustiza.
Larry Rouble and Porky Cuneo,
guards with bad legs from the
Washington battle, came to practice,
but did not play. Larry was using
a cane, Cuneo a pair of crutches.
Bob Black was still at Rouble's
guard spot.
Another disability, though minor,
was the missing tooth of Jack Claik,
end. He doesn't yet know just when
and how it happened.
Rushing Tactics Used
While Nevers was flinging passes
to the Grays, the varsity was try
ing to bottle them up. Critics are
now attributing much of the future
happiness of Card football to the
rushing tactics of Monk Moscrip and
Keith Topping; and they're not il
legal, either.
Up in Seattle this aggressive pair
of ends is still being praised for
much of the Husky defeat. They
were in so quick that Haines, Cain,
and the others couldn't pass, or
run, or do anything very well; and
they will be watched Saturday for
further play like that and further
all-America booming.

Broncs here Saturday.
Practice Pass Defense
Tiny thought it would be a very
fine idea to try passes against the
regulars, for three of the backtield
are new men and have not become
acquainted with the brand of trick
passes Clipper Smith teaches his
boys. Bill Paulman, Joe Vigna, and
Jimmy Coffis are the new ones,
Bobby Grayson the tried and true.
Cuddeback's eleven was captained
by Ernie Nevers, imitating Manny
Gomez, who is developing the So
brero pogo-pass lore, and who will
probably toss them Saturday. Chief
pass catchers were Earl Hoos, Walt
Chouteau, and George Bergman,
who were the Buttons, Finneys, and
Kaliskis of Santa Clara.
Gomez Threat
Gomez, who is rapidly becoming
a major Bronc threat, is carrying on
where the injured Patches Thomas
and Don de Rosa left off. It's the
same with the Indians—Coffis and
Vigna for Hamilton and Alustiza.
Larry Rouble and Porky Cuneo,
guards with bad legs from the
Washington battle, came to practice,
but did not play. Larry was using
a cane, Cuneo a pair of crutches.
Bob Black was still at Rouble's
guard spot.
Another disability, though minor,
was the missing tooth of Jack Claik,
end. He doesn't yet know just when
and how it happened.
Rushing Tactics Used
While Nevers was flinging passes
to the Grays, the varsity was try
ing to bottle them up. Critics are
now attributing much of the future
happiness of Card football to the
rushing tactics of Monk Moscrip and
Keith Topping; and they're not il
legal, either.
Up in Seattle this aggressive pair
of ends is still being praised for
much of the Husky defeat. They
were in so quick that Haines, Cain,
and the others couldn't pass, or
run, or do anything very well; and
they will be watched Saturday for
further play like that and further
all-America booming.
Clipper Smith, impersonated by
Murray Cuddeback, and his able as
sistant and line coach, Buck Shaw
(Husky Hunt) sent their Santa
Clara "bronchials" against the Card
varsity last night in practice.
The "bronchials" were really only
the Stanford Grays, and they ran
through Santa Clara plays and
passes in order to prepare for the
Stanford varsity meeting with the
Broncs here Saturday.
