## Stewart Equals Course Record By Scoring 67 Bright Prospects Seen For Indian Golfers 
### 
By equaling ihe Stanford golf
course record of 67 in a brilliant
round Monday afternoon, "Spec"
Stewart of the Indian varsity proved
himself to be rounding into con
sistently excellent form.
He went out in 34 and came back
in 33 to tie the mark hung up
by Mark Frye, Oakland profes
sional, and later equaled by Jack
Hoerner, of last year's Card var
sity. This was Stewart's third
exceptional score in the last few
days, he having scored 6!)'s in his
last two previous rounds.
Coach Eddie Twiggs was highly
pleased with the Indian star's show
ing, and saw a fairly bright outlook
for the championship possibilities
of the current varsity outfit. Morse
Erskine, veteran from last year, can
be counted on for some good golf,
according to Twiggs, and aside from
him there will be other outstanding
upperclassmeli golfers in the persons
of Don Edwards, Warren Munro, and
Bud Nicholas.
Twiggs is very doubtful con
cerning the possibility of having
Lawson Little, who is returning
to school in January, according
to his father, as a team member,
because during most of the team
matches he will probably be com
peting in large tourneys.
In addition to these there will be
Landon Wheeler, Pete Haas, Brown
Cannon, Louis Cass, and Jack Wal
lace, five promising sophomore golf
ers.
