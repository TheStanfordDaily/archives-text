# Water Poloists To Face Olympic Club Tomorrow
## 
### 
Strengthened by Coach Nort
Thornton's new offensive breaking
attack and his revision of the line
up, varsity water poloists will tangle
with the Olympic Club in a return
match set for tomorrow evening at
8:30 o'clock in the Club pool.
The fact that the Olympians are
out to avenge their defeat of last
week and that the Indians would
like very much to drub the Club men
for the second time should serve tc
make the tilt a toss-up.
Stanford now ranks second in
the Pacific Association standings,
with the Bears leading. So if the
Cardinals can down the Winged
'O' outfit and then defeat Califor
nia on November 23, they will
finish the season in no less than
a tie for the Pacific Association
championship.
In practice sessions this weep
Thornton has been encouragcd bj

i the performances of Don Peterson,
Ben Voss, and Chuck Giffin, who
1 were moved up from the second
string to hold down guard positions
in their first varsity tilt last Friday.
Captain Wally Wiget, too, who
| was transferred from guard to
sprint, has shown plenty of
strength in passing and teamwork,
> as have Bill Clemo, veteran for
ward, and "Suds'' Sutherland,
I former guard now swimming at
forward.
The entire rejuvenated line-up
| stacks up pretty well in Thornton's
opinion and with this week's heavy
workouts to polish their attack, the
Cardinals should have a slight edge
; over the Olympians in tomorrow's
' game.

Lizards of the desert cannot tol
| erate excessively high tempera
' tures.
