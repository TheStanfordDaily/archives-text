Educationally minded A.S.S.U. members
have long pondered over the seeming scarcity
of liberal and educational talks, forums, and
what-nots on this presumably liberal campus,
it is not because authorities block them; hide
bound conservatism is not the reason. Jioth
student and administrative leaders have come
to realize how little appeal such programs
seem to have for the student body at large.
The Public Exercises Committee has often
bad occasion to note poor student turnouts at
regularly scheduled assemblies for which
elasses were dismissed —even the students'
own. This committee schedules two or three
assemblies a quarter, and these hardly make
a pretense at filling an assembly hall which
accommodates less than half the student
body.
The liberal-backed Ariusitice Day peace as
sembly fell through, because a Jifth assembly
for the quarter during morning hours was
apparently out of Ihe question. From past
experience, feeble student turnout for such

| an assembly could be expected. Last spring's
I peace assembly, one of the campus' more
I lively ones, tailed to draw a near-capacity
| crowd.
Overlooked by about 95 per cent of the
students are the forums, debates, and lectures
which could serve as a valuable supplement
to formal classroom "capsule-like" education.
It is not necessary to mention the Tuesday
1 lectures' well-night zero student drawing
| power; they seem to scare the campus with
| their relatively high-brow tone.
Tonight students have a chance to show
i that they are not 100 per cent apathetic
i toward campus programs. A non-highbrow
j entertainment including pictures of the
l Washington game and a debate on women
I paying for dates will be given in the Little
! Theater. For those who can subordinate the
almost irresistible dates and athletics combi
nation, there is a forum on the San Francisco
longshoremen's dispute slated for the Wom
! en's Clubhouse that bids fair to be highly
J informative.
