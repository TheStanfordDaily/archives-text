# The 						Battle, Gentlemen, Is Not Over Yet

Washington has fallen, hut the football
team lias the season to finish; students too
"seem to have a job to finish. Two weeks ago
discussion of the poor quality of hymn-sing
ing led to a little action on the part of the
Hallv Committee, and a little learning by the
si udents.
Hut it has always been conceded that a
little learning is a dangerous thing. In this
case a slight improvement seems to have
lulled the students back to their old indiffer
ence, their leaders back to their old inactivity.
The two depot rallies found the hymn an
almost audible quantityâ€”which is some im
provement. But there is a long way to go if
by the IJiCame fans at large are to hear that
Stanford students have a hymn with which
to honor their alma mater.
To the Rally Committee falls the honor
and the duty of visiting living groups, of en
couraging the students to learn the hymn by
fostering opportunities for hymn-singing.
Possibly rallies could stress more hymn
singing, instead of the axe-yell which every
one knows, which is able to take care of itself,
and which is presumably a Big Came tradi
tion.
