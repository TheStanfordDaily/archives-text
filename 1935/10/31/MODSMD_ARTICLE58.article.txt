# Fans, as Well as Team, Now Can See Pictures
## 
### 
Pictures of all important future Stanford
football games will be shown to students,
under auspices of Fx Committee, the student
governors unofficially decided Tuesday as
they took over the showing of this week's

Washington game films for tonight.
This move, designed this week particularly
for the purpose of familiarizing students with
the details of a game that most of them were
unable to attend, by being continued for other
games this year will do much to boost campus
interest in the Indian team, and will be en
tirely worth while even for home games.
Coach Tinv Thornhill has made it a prac
tice to show pictures to team members, for
the obvious purpose of pointing out faults in
details and style of play so they can be cor
rected before the next game.
Now, thanks to Fx Committee, the policy
is to be extended to the entire student body.
These pictures—whether they are a re-hash
of home games students have already seen or
a graphic record of contests played too far
away for the majority of Farm residents to
attend—will be both entertaining and in
structive to Stanford's football fans.
