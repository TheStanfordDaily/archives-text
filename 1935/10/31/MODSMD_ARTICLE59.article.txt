# Bull Session
## ALL'S FAIR IN THIS WAR 
### 
The first skirmish in the battle of the 24 is over
. . . The opening struggle of the fraternities to open
the widest door to the largest number of the best
freshmen . . . held out in the clear for all to see . . .
has passed . . . and now the war drums are quiyt as
dark plots and doecls begin.

So all that are new and uninformed may know, the
men's rushing war on this campus is governed by a
set of nine rules, constitution-like in character be
cause of their general ambiguity. The gist of most
of the rules is that fraternity men and freshmen must
treat each other like lepers except under this and
that and the other condition.
« * * *
Under the rules public combat between the 24 to
impress the Encinamen Ls limited to five set periods.
Other meetings, except when the university is not in
session, are strictly prohibited—in the rules. Thus it is
outside the law for Row men to take freshmen out and
spend money on them, to loan freshmen their cars, or
to get one or more freshmen off in a corner and apply
high pressure salesmanship.
But all's fair in love or war, the universal unwrit
ten law states, and since the Row must rationalize in
order to apply this rule to rushing, the battle for
pledges is classed as war since there is certainly no
element of love in it. Under the all's fair clause comes
the right to organize friendly little gatherings up to
the city and at wayside points, the right to s.end out a
smooth tongued committee to "confer" with certain
members of the Class of '39 under cover of darkness,
the right to make a quiet visit to an Encina room in
case of an emergency, the right to make a friendly
loan of a car now and then, and the right to see that a
favored lower division man doesn't go dateless or
bidless on the night of a big dance.

Fortunately for everyone concerned these extra
legal activities are kept strictly quiet in all quarters
except in Encina Hall itself. There information about
most spurious phases of the rushing war is more or
less common gossip since an Encinaman can't help
boasting a little about how this house or that wants
him so badly it stops at nothing to get him.

Over in Ethiopia the British news correspondents,
all out to cut each other's throats in getting exclu
sive news about the war, held a meeting last month.
Someone proposed a resolution "condemning the
common practice of bribing wireless station opera
tors." But those Englishmen were honest. They voted
down that resolution and went on record as favoring
bigger bribes.

Here at Stanford 24 fraternities are out to cut
each other's throats in getting the best freshmen.
They have all condemned illegal rushing, but only on
paper. The fraternities might just as well be honest
Englishmen and come out in the open with a resolu
tion favoring bigger and better off-campus rushing
parties. John McClelland
