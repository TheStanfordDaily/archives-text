To the defense of a time-honored and emi
nently proper Stanford tradition—that of no
dates at football games — comes the Rally
Committee. Like many of the Farm's old-line
Rough traditions, the no-date-at-games one
is suffering trom the women's inllux.
Into Rally Committeemen's hair have come
a flock of sissv-kissers who gum up the seal

No doubt many Roughs will join the Rally
men in this plea to the smoothies to do tlu'ir
dating away from football games, and let
who will have the misfortune of sitting next
to the women's section.
