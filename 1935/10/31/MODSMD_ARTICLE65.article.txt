# HECKLING OUR HASHER
## 
### 
! The Editor, Sir:
i I was very surprised today to |
'' find, upon reading Our Hasher, a I
I rather catty little tidbit far better'
' suited to a Winchell column. Our
Hasher's most witty ability to gen
eralize his clever comments has so
far kept his keyholing and such
from being distastefully personal, :
i even in the case of the terrific
Robleites.
But when fond Hasher gets per
j sonal enough to gather exaggerated I
and somewhat erroneous material !
with just enough facts added to in- j
dicate clearly whom he was dis
cussing, the humor is slightly lost, i
Distorting the truth to make news
:or give someone a laugh can also
give others a lot of misery.
Play fair, Our Hasher, and stick
to the right keyholes.
Just Me
