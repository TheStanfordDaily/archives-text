# SAVE THE AXE
## 
### 
Hie Editor, Sir:
When the Stanford rooters say
"No" to the Axe yell, something is
wrong. The fact is we are giving !
'em the axe too often. Even that
sacred yell can lose its power by be
coming too common.
Everyone knows the Axe yell, and
by everyone I mean all the thou
sands of people who have ever filled
a stadium to see the Indians slaugh
ter the Huskies, Bears, and the rest '
of the educated menagerie of the I
West. The Axe belongs to Stanford, i
and when Stanford uses it every
rooter behind it means ii and means
it hard. But to use the yell more 1
than once in a game (except the Big
Game) will degrade it to the level
of a spell-out!
We reserve the Hymn for certain
impressive occasions. Why not keep
the Axe yell in the same category?
Let's give 'em the axe, but let's not
give it to 'em unless they deserve
it! San Jose didn't merit the yell,
nor does Santa Clara. U.S.C. doesn't
either, unless they turn the tables
on us. But Cal deserves it! So let's
save the old A?:e yell, and not dull
its edge on the necks of those whom
we can strangle bare-handed.
