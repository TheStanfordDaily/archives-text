IT'S MOKE FUN to know. That's
i what eastern college men seem to
i think, anyway, and because they do j
| a number of unemployed magicians \
j are picking up dollars here and |
there teaching the collegians the I
tricks. Each campus '"date" of two ,
or three days nets the prestidigita
tors about $200. What the fellows !
net from prestidigitating the cards is j
unreported.
CRITICISM: All reviewers seem j
to agree on Max Reirihardt's film- |
ization of ."Midsummer Night's
Dream." The concensus seems to i
be: "It's a swell picture except for (
the actors." . . . Warner Brothers
| produced "Dream" with the expecta
. tion of losing $500,000. Just another
"noble experiment."
j GAIETIES SKITS, at least those
j that were tried out Monday, show
I the "Anything Goes" influence.
Practically all contained a parody
I on "You're the Top."
AMERICANISM: Eastern papers '
■ are suggesting that readers show !
their disapproval of the Administra
tion by placing all postage stamps
j upside down on letters.
LOS ANGELES is becoming more [
' and more of a legitimate theater cen
! ter. Latest to announce extensive j
; plans for L.A. production is J. J. ;
i Shubert, veteran Broadway pro- 1
| ducer. He plans to try out all his !
I new plays in Los Angeles in the j
i future before taking them to New
| York. . . . Irene Bordoni will star

' in an L.A. production of the new ■
Cole Porter musical, "French Dress
ing." And it will see Geary street
before Broadway.
IDLE WONDER: Why doesn't I
someone invent a method of welding
angel cake frosting to the cake?
