# DIANA'S DIARY

### CO-ED SHOPPER 
October 31
Dear Diary: I'm off tonight to an
old-fashioned Hallowe'en party at.
the home of a friend of Ted's in
Atherton. We're going to duck for
apples and play all ihe kid games,
so a sports costume is the order of
the evening. I'm about to dash
madly down to MARY ELIZA
BETH'S. 119 University, to claim
that orange rabbit's hair wool she
has in the window. Aside from its
Hallowe'enish color, it's adorable—a
simple two-piece with a belted jack
et that buttons up the front. There
is a turn-down collar with a small
brown silk scarf. She has the per
fect hat—a Breton sailor in a match
ing orange. I've been ordering the
flowers for the open house on Sun
day. They'll be, of course, from th'>
FLOWER SHOP, 175 University.
I'm mad about the corsage of small
green orchids I got for the house
mother. They're inexpensive and
can be worn several times, they last
so well. I just discovered that my
favorite drug store, the UNIVER
SITY PHARMACY, 134 University,
which is the exclusive agency for
Lenthcric and Alexandra de MarkoiT
cosmetics, has an elegant line of sta
tionery. LYDIA gave me a tip that
I've been passing around. It seems
that her Salakuta shampoos — the
new scientific hair treatments- -are
a real dandruff remover. She lets

Stanford gals charge at her salon,
160 University. There's plenty of
news about handkerchiefs. MAR
IAN SEIMAS, 534 Ramona, has
some darling hand-made ones in
the new fall shades. My favorite is
the navy blue with the football ap
plique. The old boy friend, Jerry,
turned up again last night and took
me out to dinner. We went to
JEROLD'S, 229 Hamilton, Paly'.s
smart new restaurant. The food's
so good and the place is so attrac
tive, I made a mental note of it as
the restaurant where I'll bring the
family on Saturday when they
come down for the game. I've been
framed —but in a very nice way.
I took a picture down to WIGHT
MAN'S. 366 University, for framing
and plan to give it to Mother for
Christmas. This shop also has a
grand line of gifts, I notice. When
you want to get the low-down on
a course, phone the ASSOCIATED
STENOGRAPHERS, P. A. 4502.
They've been typing weekly papers
for Stanford courses so long they
know all the answers. I'm a regu
lar caller at their new office, 443
Bryant. With the cold wind blowin',
everyone in the house is shopping
for bedroom slippers. I direct them
to the WALK-OVER. 220 Univer
sity. where there's everything from
the frilly, furry type to really warm
wool-lined bootees that come over
the ankle and fasten with a zipper.
