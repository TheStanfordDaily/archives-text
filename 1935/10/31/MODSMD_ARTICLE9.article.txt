# Crowded, Speeding Cars Hold Death, Says Davis

### DAVE BOTSFORD 
Past palm after palm speeds a blue j
1 convertible coupe as the speed- i
I ometer needle wavers at 60, then
165. Four in the front seat. Two j
I carefree lads on each running board,
j The bright rod roadster ahead ,
swerves suddenly—with no signal— I
j to ihe left. Jerkily yanking the ,
j steel ing wheel to the right, the '
| driver of the blue coupe narrowly
I avoids crashing into the roadster.
Narrow Escape
A collision —no! But such things
| do happen on Palm Drive, accord
ing to Campus Officer Gordy Davis.
The four boys on the running board
might have been thrown to the hard
asphalt. And when bones meet road
the crunching thud is not pleasant.
The driver could have been so
crowded that only a palm or a tele
phone pole would have stopped the
careening car.
To avoid such situations —it's sur
prising how often they arise —
Men's and Women's Councils have
laid down strict campus traffic laws,
i Violators will be promptly tagged

by Officer Davis, mercilessly fined by
the councils.
Speeding Dangerous
To travel over 30 miles per hour
on Palm Drive, over 20 miles on
Lasuen, Alvarado, and other con
gested roads, is just money out of a
driver's pocket. Overloading cars is
a constant sore-spot to campus safe
ty. Hereafter no one may lawfully
carry mort than three in the front
seat or anyone on the running
board. And it's considered wise to
slow down to 15 miles per hour at
intersections.
Commenting on violators of the
above rules, Officer Davis said yes
terday that most students readily
admit their faults, readily pay their
fines. No leniency is given those
who plead ignorance. At least at the
last Women's Council meeting 11
women who asserted they knew not
the 30-mile-per-hour Palm Drive
rule were not spared.
Davis gave a final note of op
timism with: "Speeding isn't as bad
as it was . . . quite."
