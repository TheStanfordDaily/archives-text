Assembly Hall curtain is ready to 1 (
ri.se at 8:30 o'clock on tonight's per- -
formance of "The Dark. Tower." Al- ,
though the ticket sale has been sue- !
cessful to date, many good seats still |,
remain, and may be obtained at the j ,
A.S.S.U. office today, or at the box
office after 7 o'clock tonight.
All week the property women, J
Malou Dobbs, Kay Campbell, and j,

of lettuce, and a quart of milk. All |,
eight-foot portrait of a Cardinal, ;,
done by Gilman Oust, and the two j,
white rats, Heloise and Abelard, ob- j ,
tained from the psych department,
will also make their appearance.

die class living room of a house in I.
New York City, the home of the j ;
Wells family. This scene is followed !
by one in a room in the Waldorf-
Astoria Hotel. Both of these sets
were designed and constructed by !
Phil Brown, technical director.
Although the production is a mys- j
tery melodrama, there are also many |
bits of sparkling comedy, especially j
in the lines of Hattie, played by
Rosemary Benet. Plot and dialogue i
are a colloborate work of George S. j
Kaufman and Alexander Woollcott, j
both of whom are well known for
previous dramatic and critical 1
works.
During the play the Stanford Con- j
cert Orchestra, with Myron Birn- !
baum directing, will play "Manhat- '
tan Melodrama" as theme music, 1
and in the intermission "Zigeuner," ;
from Noel Coward's "Bitter Sweet," j
and selections fi'om "Rio Rita,"!
among others.
"The Dark Tower" is not only en- j
tirely student-acted but also stu- ■
dent-directed for the first time in 1
Stanford dramatic history. Frank j
O'Neill is taking the place of Direc
tor William Murray .Timmons, who
is recuperating from an appendicitis
operation.
The lead roles are taken by Phyl- '
lis Corson, in the part of Jessica 1
Wells, and Fred Clark as Damon |
Wells. Others of the cast include: j
Rosemary Benet, Hattie; Charles
Corker, Stanley Vance; Jean Albert

Ben Weston; Fritzi Kolster, Daphne |
Martin; Robert Mallet, Barry Jones.
Arthur Spalding, Dr. Kendall; '
Betty Watkins, Patsy Dowling;
Paul Crary, a bell boy; and Harold (
Kahn, Inspector Curtis. All these 1
players have hod considerable pre
vious dramatic experience both al
Stanford and elsewhere, and should :
turn in excellent dramatic portray- I
als.

by one in a room in the Waldorf-
Astoria Hotel. Both of these sets
were designed and constructed by !
Phil Brown, technical director.
Although the production is a mys- j
tery melodrama, there are also many |
bits of sparkling comedy, especially j
in the lines of Hattie, played by
Rosemary Benet. Plot and dialogue i
are a colloborate work of George S. j
Kaufman and Alexander Woollcott, j
both of whom are well known for
previous dramatic and critical 1
works.
During the play the Stanford Con- j
cert Orchestra, with Myron Birn- !
baum directing, will play "Manhat- '
tan Melodrama" as theme music, 1
and in the intermission "Zigeuner," ;
from Noel Coward's "Bitter Sweet," j
and selections fi'om "Rio Rita,"!
among others.
"The Dark Tower" is not only en- j
tirely student-acted but also stu- ■
dent-directed for the first time in 1
Stanford dramatic history. Frank j
O'Neill is taking the place of Direc
tor William Murray .Timmons, who
is recuperating from an appendicitis
operation.
The lead roles are taken by Phyl- '
lis Corson, in the part of Jessica 1
Wells, and Fred Clark as Damon |
Wells. Others of the cast include: j
Rosemary Benet, Hattie; Charles
Corker, Stanley Vance; Jean Albert
son, Martha Temple; Robert Garred, '
Ben Weston; Fritzi Kolster, Daphne |
Martin; Robert Mallet, Barry Jones.
Arthur Spalding, Dr. Kendall; '
Betty Watkins, Patsy Dowling;
Paul Crary, a bell boy; and Harold (
Kahn, Inspector Curtis. All these 1
players have hod considerable pre
vious dramatic experience both al
Stanford and elsewhere, and should :
turn in excellent dramatic portray- I
als.
With sets complete, properties as- j
sembled, and cast letter-perfect, the 1
Assembly Hall curtain is ready to 1 (
ri.se at 8:30 o'clock on tonight's per- -
formance of "The Dark. Tower." Al- ,
though the ticket sale has been sue- !
cessful to date, many good seats still |,
remain, and may be obtained at the j ,
A.S.S.U. office today, or at the box
office after 7 o'clock tonight.
All week the property women, J
Malou Dobbs, Kay Campbell, and j,
Janet Dole, have been collecting!
such varied props as a bottle of ; j
Shasta water, a feather boa, a head 1
of lettuce, and a quart of milk. All |,
eight-foot portrait of a Cardinal, ;,
done by Gilman Oust, and the two j,
white rats, Heloise and Abelard, ob- j ,
tained from the psych department,
will also make their appearance.
The play opens on a typical mid- \
die class living room of a house in I.
New York City, the home of the j ;
Wells family. This scene is followed !
