# Photolith To Pictures Ten Top 'Whips'
## 
### 
Just who are the Bawl-Out
Whips, the top ten Stanford
scholars, will be revealed to
morrow with the distribution
of the first fall quarter photo
lith, a supplement of The Daily.
After determining those with
the best bawl-out, ratings, the
these first ten individuals were
not only A-l scholars but high
ly active campus personalities
besides.
The staff went to Dr. Lewis
M. Termin, Stanford's world
recognized psychologist, to find
out why these "Phi Betes" were
not the traditional "book worm"
type. In one of the few pub
lic statements of his year of
sabbatical leave, Dr. Terman
explodes the bespectacled-book
worm panel that is connected
by "straight A" averages.
Besides the "Bawl-Out
Whips" the photolith will con
tain a page of football shots,
including a "high dive" by
Bobby Grayson and a series of
photos of the freshman-sopho
more mud fight.
Photolith photographers in
clude Bob Eiscnbach, Hunter
Hendee, Rex Hardy, and Dick
Levi, Mort D'Evelyn is editor of
the supplement.
