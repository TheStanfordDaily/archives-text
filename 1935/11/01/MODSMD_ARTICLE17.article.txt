"Learn the Hymn!" say Phil Coghlan and Dorothy Sweet, Men's
and Women's Rally Committee heads. "It must be sung al the close
of every game before leaving the bleachers. An opportunity is
given below for all students to learn the hymn by heart for Satur
day's game."
HAIL, STANFORD. HAIL
(The Hymn)
Where the rolling foothills rise
Up toward mountains higher.
Where at eve the Coast Range lies
In the sunset fire,
Flushing deep and paling,
Here, we raise our voices hailing
Thee, our Alma Mater.
' Refrain
From the foothills to the bay
It shall ring
As we sing
II shall ring and float away
Hail, Stanford, Hail!
Hail, Stanford. Hail!
II
Tender vistas ever new
Through the arches meet the eyes
Where the led roofs riin the skies
Flecked with cloudlets sailing.
Here we raise our voices, hailing
Thee, our Alma Mater.
