GENEVA, Oct. 31 (/Pj. — The ;

i turned to the task of clearing away j
i sanction enforcement difficulties be- |
fore fixing the date on which the
economic siege actually will begin.
French and British delegations,
simultaneously, collaborated on

I sented tomorrow, either by Premier
j Pierre Laval or by Sir Samuel
Hoare, the British foreign secretary,
to "clear the air" on the subject of
I a possible peace settlement.
