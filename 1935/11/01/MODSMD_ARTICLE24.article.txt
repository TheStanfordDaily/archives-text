# 'Date' Debate Called Draw
## 
### 
' A woman wants to spend money
on the man she likes," said the af
firmative last night in the Little
Theater as Stanford's first campus
debtate on the question, "Resolved,
that the Stanford girl should pay her
share of the expenses on a date,"
was called a draw.
Speaking in favor of the "equal
ity" systems were Mary Boggs and
Marshall Dill, while opposing them
were Ruth French and Jack Clark
who stood pat for the status quo.
Student Manager Bob Gros was
chairman.
The Little Theater was packed to
the windows and aisles for the
showing of last Saturday's Washing
ton football game which followed
the debate. Songs and yells led by
Jim Triolo, Web Jones, and Gros
filled in the time between the three
reels, and a second showing was
made necessary to accommodate the
crowd which waited outside.
