# Broncos May Upset Red Toboggan Slide
## 'We Won't Lose Another Game This Year' Is Stanford's Vow Tie of 1934 Recalled Rouble, Hamilton Absent From Opening Line-up 
### Gordy Frost

I That was what Santa Clara d'd
to Stanford last year just when In
; dian hopes were buoyed skyward.
And if that gang of Broncos realizes
its ambitions again this season, it'll
be the same thing when Sania Clara
and Stanford leave the stadium turf
late tomorrow afternoon.
liut those of the "red tobog
gan" have a word to say about
the matter. Their vow—"Stanford
won't lose another game this year."

So it appears
hat Mr. Clipper
Smith and hs
herd will have a
of trouble
tomorrow alter
the whistle
blows at 2
o'clock, bui
there's no do b
ing the fact thai
they will make
their presence
known. They
will pull every
trick that might
result in a Stan-

ford upset from the bag.
They will have Ray Kaliski primed
for the speed running and Nello
Falaschi set for power drives into
the line. And little Manny Gomez
has been showing some tricky field
sprinting that will mark him a
threat. The Bronc line has been
showing good defensive form all
season.
Against the Washington Huskies
a month age they drew a 13-7 lick
ing but only after the northern squad
had turned in a record performance
aided by the right breaks. And
Washington had considerable trouble
crashing the Santa Clara forward
wall.
Thus it stands to reason that Stan
ford, a non-too-easy 6-0 victory
chalked against the Huskies, won't
find it a cinch job breaking through
the Bronc defense.
All week Tiny Thcrnhill has been
drilling that fact into his charges,
and last night he had them work
ing till long after sundown. Pass
offense and defense against Murray
Cuddeback's mythical "Broncs,"
dummy scrimmage, and signal prac
tice were the orders of the afternoon.
Tiny plans to use the same
first team he started at Seattle
last week with two probable ex
ceptions: Larry Rouble will be re
placed at right guard by Bob
Black, and Bones Hamilton wiil
probably rest his bad muscle while
Jini Coffis gets the call.
Larry Rouble, the splint removed
i from his injured knee, will give the
, bad leg a try this afternoon. Not
! until next week will he be able to
do any sti*enuous work.
Yesterday afternoon's ''student
practice" failed to produce any great
| show of student enthusiasm. But
1 Thornhill reports that "the fellows
1 are plenty worried" even if Farm
j fans consider the affair a pushover.

I That was what Santa Clara d'd
to Stanford last year just when In
; dian hopes were buoyed skyward.
And if that gang of Broncos realizes
its ambitions again this season, it'll
be the same thing when Sania Clara
and Stanford leave the stadium turf
late tomorrow afternoon.
liut those of the "red tobog
gan" have a word to say about
the matter. Their vow—"Stanford
won't lose another game this year."

So it appears
hat Mr. Clipper
Smith and hs
herd will have a
of trouble
tomorrow alter
the whistle
blows at 2
o'clock, bui
there's no do b
ing the fact thai
they will make
their presence
known. They
will pull every
trick that might
result in a Stan-

ford upset from the bag.
They will have Ray Kaliski primed
for the speed running and Nello
Falaschi set for power drives into
the line. And little Manny Gomez
has been showing some tricky field
sprinting that will mark him a
threat. The Bronc line has been
showing good defensive form all
season.
Against the Washington Huskies
a month age they drew a 13-7 lick
ing but only after the northern squad
had turned in a record performance
aided by the right breaks. And
Washington had considerable trouble
crashing the Santa Clara forward
wall.
Thus it stands to reason that Stan
ford, a non-too-easy 6-0 victory
chalked against the Huskies, won't
find it a cinch job breaking through
the Bronc defense.
All week Tiny Thcrnhill has been
drilling that fact into his charges,
and last night he had them work
ing till long after sundown. Pass
offense and defense against Murray
Cuddeback's mythical "Broncs,"
dummy scrimmage, and signal prac
tice were the orders of the afternoon.
Tiny plans to use the same
first team he started at Seattle
last week with two probable ex
ceptions: Larry Rouble will be re
placed at right guard by Bob
Black, and Bones Hamilton wiil
probably rest his bad muscle while
Jini Coffis gets the call.
Larry Rouble, the splint removed
i from his injured knee, will give the
, bad leg a try this afternoon. Not

do any sti*enuous work.
