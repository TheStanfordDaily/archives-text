# Paddock Note 'Not Enough' Says Masters
## Long Beach Paper Admits Error in Grid Story 
### 
An admission that Art Cohn, a
columnist for the Long Beach Press-
Telegram, had "gone off half
cocked" in charging "bad blood" on
the Stanford football team, was re
ceived yesterday from Charley Pad
dock, former "world's fastest hu
man," by Graduate Manager Al
Masters.
The admission was contained in
an answer made by Paddock, now
business manager of the Long Beach
paper, to a protest filed by Masters.
Masters described Paddock's
statement as "not an acceptable an
swer" since it gave no explanation
of Cohn's reason for printing charges
of trouble between Bobby Grayson
and Frank Alustiza, and did not
offer a retraction.
"There's not much we can do in
such a matter, however," Masters
said last night, "except to protest.
Since the Associated Students also
protested, the next move is up to
them."
No answer has been received by
the Daily to an Ex Committee-ap
proved letter sent to Cohn.
