# Duce's Natives Seize Town

### 
ADIGRAT. Ethiopia, Oct. 31 (£*).— !
Trained native troops beating a trail |
for the main advance of the Italian
left column, occupied another village
today and seized wells to supply the
Blackshirts with water.
Sharp action was reported earlier
from the southwest border of Eri- ;
tiea, where Italians crossed the Setit !
River and drove back Ethiopians j
massed at Nlaghin. After dispers- !
ing the enemy, the Blackshirts re- j
crossed the stream and took up the
defensive on their side.
The native troops of the northern 1
forces have deployed tactically as
far as Hauzien, halfway to strategic j
Makale, and have taken the natural I
fortress of Amba Sicn, 30 miles i
from that objective.
