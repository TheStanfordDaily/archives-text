# Alustiza Rests Quietly After Eye Operation
## Skilled Surgery Feat Done By Dr. Hans Barkan 
### R. B. Jones 
Frankie Alustiza was operated on !
yesterday morning at approximately I
9 o'clock in the Stanford Lane Hos- j
pital in San Francisco. The surgery j
was in the hands of Dr. Hans Bar- !
kan, who was assisted in the opera- !
tion by Doctors Gordon Smith and |
W. E. Borley. J
In Stanford's game with the |
University of California at Los j
Angeles Bruins on October 12
Alustiza was injured by a kick
on the side of the head, and the
retina of his eye was torn and j
pulled away from the eyeball.
Contrary to popular belief, the
break in the retina on the upper [
back side of his eyeball was not
operated on by the use of a knife, j
Rather than remove the eyeball in j
the usual fashion, the doctors per- ;
formed the delicate operation by
rotating the eyeball downward to
the point of the injury. Fine plati
num needles were inserted into the
thick, tough skin-like covering of !
the ball, and an electric charge was '
sent through the needles to set up !
molecular action. The eyeball be
came inflamed, and this heating j
process was used whereby a scar tis- 1
sue is to foi-rn and pull the dislocated
retina back into place.
Dr. Thomas Kelly, publicity di
rector for the medical association,
when asked about Frank's con
dition, said, "Everything went
nicely, and I feel that his chances
for almost complete recovery are
better than other's but, of course,
Alustiza's football days are over."
The '"Bounding Basque" is re
ported to have rested easily last
night, and he is receiving no visitors
I at all. He will probably be in bed
! ten days and it will be three weeks
j before he is out of the hospital, Dr.
I Kelly further announced last night,
j Absolute quiet is being maintained
i for him, and no one will be able to
5 see him for a period of two weeks.
