# Mob Riots At Walker Docks
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Oct, 21 (TP).â€”Amid
tumultous and riotous scenes of
welcome by the Broadway faithful, i
James J. Walker, strangely nervous |
and uncertain, came back from exile !
today to the town he deserted under |
fire three years ago.
The trip down the bay of the liner !
Manhattan, which brought Walker
and his wife, the former Betty ,
Compton of the stage, over from Eu- |
rope, was a noisy triumphal proces
sion that verged into hysterical rrio'b
scenes at the Chelsea piers.
The few police on the pier were |
inadequate to hold the crowd. So
j terrific was the jam around Walker's j
I stateroom on the Manhattan that the i
combined efforts of three husky j
j bodyguards, five policemen, a police i
i captain, and ship line officials were j
j required to extricate them and push
j them up a back companionway. j
! The former mayor and his wife j
I narrowly escaped injury as they ;
| stepped from the gangplank to the j
| pier. So great was the pressure of
I the crowd behind them that the j
j straining arms of seamen gave way
] and a score of men and women were
hurled down the gangway steps to
the pier floor. None, apparently, was
seriously hurt.
For the first time in history, Cali
fornia this summer shipped straw
j berries as far east as Missouri.
