# UPHOLDING THE NAVY

The Editor, Sir: |
Mr. Eisenbach's criticism of k
"Shipmates Forever" the other day, j
seems to have been more anti- |
Hearst than anti-Navy, although it j
must be admitted that the Navy got
well splashed with expressions that
were as misleading as they were
extreme.
For example, it seems to me rather j
unjust to charge Mr. Hearst with
"cunning" in "using sobs, laughs, [
and thrills, not bald fact, to convey '
the pleasantness of naval service." [
The scenario is a bit one-sided, of j
course; idealized, if you like; but ■
even so it is fairly true to life. My j
own Naval Academy years con- !
tained experiences very like some j
of those shown, even to the boiler j
explosion, which was a very bald i
fact indeed. 1 think that if Mr. Ei- j
} senbach were better acquainted I
I with the Navy and with Navy peo- j
I pie he might understand their utter j
i conviction that a fighting man's life i
is a lot of fun, that warships are '
beautiful, and why he wouldn't be j

I I have studied under some twenty- I
j "odd" professors here and in the
East during the past three years, and

I present, or future. Now, I do not
j approve of William Randolph
Hearst, nor do I read his lousy news
