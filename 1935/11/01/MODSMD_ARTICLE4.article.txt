# U.S.C. Tickets Selling Slowly
## 
### 
Only about 50 rooters' tickets for
the Stanford-U.S.C. game in Los
Angeles on November 9 were sold
yesterday, according to Don Lieben
dorfer, director of the B.A.C. news
service, last night.
Liebendorfer also stated that, in
spite of the fact that there are ap
proximately 450 tickets not sold up
to the present time, the B.A.C.
would soon be forced to turn them
over for sale as general admission.
He asked that all students who are
planning to go south for the gani'J
get their tickets today.
The rooting section now numbers
only a little over 1000 students. This
is much smaller than those of past
years have been, especially when the
size of the proposed U.C. rooting
section at U.C.L.A. is considered.
The California authorities expect
10,000 students to go down for that
game Saturday.
