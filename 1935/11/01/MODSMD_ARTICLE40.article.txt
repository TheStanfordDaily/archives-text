# Blame Extra Energy In Montana Quakes
## 
### 
"In California, as in earthquake
regions in general, a quake of high
intensity is usually not equalled by
any of the after shocks, but Montana
appears to have stored up enough en
ergy for a number of violent ones."
This was the statement made today
by Dr. Bailey Willis, professor emer
itus of the Stanford geology depart
ment, who expressed his surprise
that recurrent heavy shocks had
rocked Helena in the past ten days.
"It seems strange to seismologists
that the activity should be so long
continued," he said, "and this, per
haps because the period of inactivity
which preceded the present out
break had lasted for many decades."
The geologist explained that there
was a moderate shock in Montana in
1825, which may be regarded as a
forerunner, and that the continued
activity is presumably the expres
sion of the elastic strain in the gran
ites that contain the ore deposits of
Helena and Butte.
"It would be a mistake, however,
Dr. Willis concluded, "to assume that

I the future will be one of tranquility
j It may be, but again it may not."
