# Severe Shock Strikes Helena
## Two Killed As Buildings Fall; Damage Great Fleeing Residents Suffer From Zero Weather 
### 
HELENA, Mont., Oct. 31 (/P). —
The earth violently jolted Helena
again today, added two more persons
to its roll of dead, toppled homes and
buildings already weakened by 19
j perilous days of shakes and threw
the city into renewed confusion.
Striking with a rumble shortly be
i fore noon, the severe tremor, per
! haps more damaging than the roll-
I ing one of October 18, shook the
j city for 19 seconds and sent its
quiver through mountainous West
j ern Montana where it rumbled
under Butte, Great Falls, and Ana
: conda.
Chimney Kills
The force of the earth's move
ment was felt as far west as Spo
kane, Wash., and extended north
into Canada at Calgary and Leth
bridge, Alta. Only slight, however,
was the force in cities outside this
i stricken capital city.
| Today's dead brought the earth
quake toll to seven, five having
1 previously died because of injuries
or nervous shock.
Ed OBrien, 27, of Salt Lake City,
was fatally injured when a falling
smokestack caught him as it crashed
into a brewery. An unidentified
man working with O'Brien was
, killed on the spot.
Flee to Hills
Havoc played its sorry tune to the
accompaniment of brisk wintry
winds which swept Helena today
with near zero temperatures. The
I weather woes added to the task of
I caring for the previously homeless
' and the mounting names added to
the relief rolls by today's frightened
irefugees.
Buildings, especially homes, which
withstood the earlier shocks of Oc
| tober 12 and 18. and the inter
vening recurrent shocks which
| brought the total to more than 500
| tremors in the last 19 days, were
: generally in good condition tonight.
Scores Hurt
Scores were reported injured in
this renewed shaking, but hospitals
quickly reported most of the casual
! ties were of minor nature.
Today's furious attack of the
earth force caused the same fear,
the same panic and the same sort
of damage as did the severe shaker
which hit two weeks ago tomorrow
night.
Bricks toppled into the street.
I Chimneys fell. Walls bulged. And
the populace scattered to the open
! roads, relief shelters and park
areas. They snatched warm cloth
j ing and bedding as they dashed to
the bills in automobiles.
Heavy Loss
Oscar Baarson, city engineer who
had estimated previous damage at
more than $2,500,000, said today's
disaster would cause severe loss, al
; though he could not give a definite
I estimate.

HELENA, Mont., Oct. 31 (/P). —
The earth violently jolted Helena
again today, added two more persons
to its roll of dead, toppled homes and
buildings already weakened by 19
j perilous days of shakes and threw
the city into renewed confusion.
Striking with a rumble shortly be
i fore noon, the severe tremor, per
! haps more damaging than the roll-
I ing one of October 18, shook the
j city for 19 seconds and sent its
quiver through mountainous West
j ern Montana where it rumbled
under Butte, Great Falls, and Ana
: conda.
Chimney Kills
The force of the earth's move
ment was felt as far west as Spo
kane, Wash., and extended north
into Canada at Calgary and Leth
bridge, Alta. Only slight, however,
was the force in cities outside this
i stricken capital city.
| Today's dead brought the earth
quake toll to seven, five having
1 previously died because of injuries
or nervous shock.
Ed OBrien, 27, of Salt Lake City,
was fatally injured when a falling
smokestack caught him as it crashed
into a brewery. An unidentified
man working with O'Brien was
, killed on the spot.
Flee to Hills
Havoc played its sorry tune to the
accompaniment of brisk wintry
winds which swept Helena today
with near zero temperatures. The
I weather woes added to the task of
I caring for the previously homeless
' and the mounting names added to
the relief rolls by today's frightened
irefugees.
Buildings, especially homes, which
withstood the earlier shocks of Oc
| tober 12 and 18. and the inter
vening recurrent shocks which
| brought the total to more than 500
| tremors in the last 19 days, were
: generally in good condition tonight.
Scores Hurt
Scores were reported injured in
this renewed shaking, but hospitals
quickly reported most of the casual
! ties were of minor nature.
Today's furious attack of the
earth force caused the same fear,
the same panic and the same sort
of damage as did the severe shaker
which hit two weeks ago tomorrow
night.
Bricks toppled into the street.
I Chimneys fell. Walls bulged. And
the populace scattered to the open
! roads, relief shelters and park
areas. They snatched warm cloth
j ing and bedding as they dashed to
the bills in automobiles.
Heavy Loss
Oscar Baarson, city engineer who
had estimated previous damage at
more than $2,500,000, said today's
disaster would cause severe loss, al
; though he could not give a definite
I estimate.
