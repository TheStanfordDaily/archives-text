# Tankmen Play Winged 'O' Tonight
## Water Polo Team Seeks Second Win Over Olympic Club Stanford's Pacific Association Leadership Is Endangered in Crucial Contest in San Francisco Pool at 8:30 
### 
Determined to drug Post Street's Olympic Club for the second time, j
Coaeh Nort Thornton's revised line-up of varsity water poloists travels
to San Francisco tonight to meet the Winged 'O* tankmen.
The Indians will enter the Club pool, located on the corner of Post and
Mason Streets, at 8:30 o'clock, uhere they will pit a strong will to retain

their Pacific Association standing
and Thornton's newly devised of
fensive attack against the powerful,
hard-riding Olympians. The re
sulting tussle should be a toss-up.
Admission is free.
The Olympic Club will be out to
avenge their defeat received at the
hands of the Cardinals last Saturday.
And the Farm swimmers wilt be no
less desirous of gaining a second
successive victory over the Club
men, as it would leave the path clear
for a second crack at California and
a possible tie for the league cham
pionship.
Cards May Be Tops
The Bears, on the other hand,

must down the Athens Club twice, j
the Olympic Club once, and then |
defeat the Indians on November 23 j
to gain top honors. Should they j
drop but one contest before meeting !
Stanford, the Cardinals might win '
the crown.
Interest in the Pacific Coast Water i
Polo Conference centers about the |
Bear-Bruin battle in Los Angeles j
this afternoon. Both of these squads j
are undefeated. A Uclan victory i
would help the Indian cause, but |
only if the Farm tankmen can later i
wax both U.C.L.A. and California.
Hoover To Start
Coach Thornton is depending upon j
essentially the same rejuvenated |
varsity, which showed plenty of i
power last week-end, to come
through against the Olympians to
night. The only substitution in the >
line-up puts Bob Hoover at left for- ,
ward, replacing "Suds" Sutherland.
Wally Wiget will swiin at sprint;
Bill Clemo, right guard; Don Pet
erson. left guard; Ben Voss, center
back; Chuck Giftin, right for
ward; and Boh Haslaclier, goalie.
The Cardinal yearling water polo
team will face the Olympic Club
reserves tonight in a preliminary to
the varsity melee. Led by their high
scoring captain, Johnny Lamb, the
frosh have hit a winning stride and
hope to repeat their victorious per
formance of last week. The Winged
'O' aggregation, however, should
prove stronger in their home tank,
which is much smaller than any of
the Encina Pools.
