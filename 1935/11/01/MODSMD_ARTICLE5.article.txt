# Start Work On Theater Soon
## 
### 
With bids being submitted this
week, beginning of steam shovel
excavation on the new campus the
ater site is scheduled for the first, of
next week according to Comptroller
Almon E. Roth.
The theater will front on Serra
street, and will be approximately
the same distance from the street as
is the pavilion in the next block. Six
steps will lead up to the main lobby,
which will contain bronze plaques in
memory of Stanford's war dead.
The present plans were designed
to cover up the stage block. Instead
of using it as a tower, as did the
second set of plans, the classrooms
and work shops will be terraced up
so that the block will not be a great
distance higher.
Architects for the theater were
the same firm that designed Lagu
nita, Toyon, Branner, the 8.A.C.,
Roble Gym, and most campus build
ings added in recent years.
