| What is potentially one of the
i strongest basketball teams that has

| year is rapidly taking .shape under
j the tuteluge of Coach John Bunn.
The team this year will have just ]
about everything that could be de- '
sired—plenty of height and a large (
squad of experienced players. O l ' '
the 15 men now residing on the ten
| tative varsity squad, the average
j height is well over 6 feet. This alone •
will be a potent factor in the team's j
I strength.
