IT'S STILL
A TOUGH ONE

Stanford vs. Santa Clara, Novem
ber 2.
One month ago that line on the
Stanford schedule stood for one of
the toughest games the Indians
would play during the 1935 season.
But since then the Broncs have taken
a couple of hard jolts and now Stan
ford awaits tomorrow's meeting with
a feeling of too-certain security.
Stanford will be in real danger
tomorrow. Tiny Thornhill. Ernie
Nevers, the team, will tell you
that. For Santa Clara will sacri
fice everything to upset Stanford
and the Broncs are a lot that could
quite easily perpertate such an act.
They are supposedly injury-ridden
to death. Deßosa and Thomas are
out, so we heur. But Clipper Smith
and Buck Shaw, Santa Clara bosses,
are on their toes and tomorrow they'll
turn a herd of Broncos loose all
primed to kick the Indian to pieces.
Just how many of their injured
men will start probably won't be
known until the whistle blasts for
the kickoff tomorrow. The situa
tion behooves Stanford not to con
sider that affair "in the bag."

GOLDEN BEARS
WE'RE WITH YOU

On two fronts Stanford will fight
tomorrow. First at home for Stan
lord; second in the southland for
California. Yes, for once, the Indian
pals with the Golden Bear of Bef
keley.
The future of Stanford's 1935
football year depends directly upon
the outcome of that U.C.L.A. strug
gle. If the Bruins remain unde
feated the horizon ahead is cloudy
for tlie Indian. In that case the
only way Stanford could possibly
hope to receive a Rose Bowl bid
would be in the event that South
ern Methodist or Loyola should
dump the Bruin.
And even then it is doubtful
whether the Pasadena committee
would say "okay Stanford."
But if California does come out on
top after tomorrow's hectic after
noon in the Los Angeles Coliseum
everything will be fine. For then
the Bears will be the only unde
feated conference team and Stanford
will have its chance to dispute that
point on November 23 in the annual
Big Game.
But before that time California
meets Washington and this scribe,
who saw Washington lose last Sat
urday, does not hesitate to warn
these Bears that they've a tough
time ahead.
However, if Cal beats the Uclans
and goes still one better, defeats
Washington, the Big Game will de
cide everything—conference title and
Rose Bowl bid. And what a Big
Game that would be.
So while you're pulling for
Stanford tomorrow, throw in a
good wish for Cal. It means a lot.

GAME SHOTS
SHOW WIIY

Did you notice in the Washington
game movies last night: Monk Mos
crip and Jim Coffis iipplying "body
English" to that first field goal;
Keith Topping and Mfcnk getting
down on punts to stop Haines time
after time; Wes Muller backing up
the line without flaw; both the ends
catching the ball carrier from be
hind even after he was through the
line of scrimmage; Jimmy Coffis at
safety making shoe-string tackles to
stop possible scoring runs.
Those were th-s things, among
many others, that helped make the
scoreboard read Stanford 6, Wash
ington 0 last week-end.

pals with the Golden Bear of Bef
keley.
The future of Stanford's 1935
football year depends directly upon
the outcome of that U.C.L.A. strug
gle. If the Bruins remain unde
feated the horizon ahead is cloudy
for tlie Indian. In that case the
only way Stanford could possibly
hope to receive a Rose Bowl bid
would be in the event that South
ern Methodist or Loyola should
dump the Bruin.
And even then it is doubtful
whether the Pasadena committee
would say "okay Stanford."
But if California does come out on
top after tomorrow's hectic after
noon in the Los Angeles Coliseum
everything will be fine. For then
the Bears will be the only unde
feated conference team and Stanford
will have its chance to dispute that
point on November 23 in the annual
Big Game.
But before that time California
meets Washington and this scribe,
who saw Washington lose last Sat
urday, does not hesitate to warn
these Bears that they've a tough
time ahead.
However, if Cal beats the Uclans
and goes still one better, defeats
Washington, the Big Game will de
cide everything—conference title and
Rose Bowl bid. And what a Big
Game that would be.
So while you're pulling for
Stanford tomorrow, throw in a
good wish for Cal. It means a lot.

GAME SHOTS
SHOW WIIY

Did you notice in the Washington
game movies last night: Monk Mos
crip and Jim Coffis iipplying "body
English" to that first field goal;
Keith Topping and Mfcnk getting
down on punts to stop Haines time
after time; Wes Muller backing up
the line without flaw; both the ends
catching the ball carrier from be
hind even after he was through the
line of scrimmage; Jimmy Coffis at
safety making shoe-string tackles to
stop possible scoring runs.
Those were th-s things, among
many others, that helped make the
scoreboard read Stanford 6, Wash
ington 0 last week-end.

IT'S STILL
A TOUGH ONE

Stanford vs. Santa Clara, Novem
ber 2.
One month ago that line on the
Stanford schedule stood for one of
the toughest games the Indians
would play during the 1935 season.
But since then the Broncs have taken
a couple of hard jolts and now Stan
ford awaits tomorrow's meeting with
a feeling of too-certain security.
Stanford will be in real danger
tomorrow. Tiny Thornhill. Ernie
Nevers, the team, will tell you
that. For Santa Clara will sacri
fice everything to upset Stanford
and the Broncs are a lot that could
quite easily perpertate such an act.
They are supposedly injury-ridden
to death. Deßosa and Thomas are
out, so we heur. But Clipper Smith
and Buck Shaw, Santa Clara bosses,
are on their toes and tomorrow they'll
turn a herd of Broncos loose all
primed to kick the Indian to pieces.
Just how many of their injured
men will start probably won't be
known until the whistle blasts for
the kickoff tomorrow. The situa
tion behooves Stanford not to con
sider that affair "in the bag."

GOLDEN BEARS
WE'RE WITH YOU

On two fronts Stanford will fight
tomorrow. First at home for Stan
lord; second in the southland for
California. Yes, for once, the Indian
pals with the Golden Bear of Bef
keley.
