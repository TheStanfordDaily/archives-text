# Papooses Face Spartan Frosh Tomorrow
## Indian Babes Favorites In Early Game Stanford Yearlings Point For Little Big Game Next Saturday 
### 
With an eye for the Li tile Big
Game nsxt week-end, Coach Jimmy
j Bradshaw's Stanford frosh will at
tempt to take the San Jose Slate
lreshman team in stride tomorrow
when they meet as a preliminary to
the varsity-Santa Clara struggle.
The game will start at 12 o'clock.
The Spartan eleven, which has al
ready lost games to the Santa Clara
i and College of the Pacific first
! year teams, should not give the In
dian babes a whole lot of trouble.
They were scouted in the Bronco
| tussle by Harold Easterbrook, one of
Bradshaw's assistants, and reputedly
have a good kicking and passing
threat, with a versatile fullback by
the name of Zedderquist.
Jordan, Maino Injured
Injuries to Ken Jordan and Vern
Maino marred yesterday's scrim
mage between mixed elevens. Jor
' dan sustained a broken nose at the
, start of the session, and Everett
Crowder replaced him as second
string fullback, which position Crow
; der will probably hold. Maino, a
! reserve linesman, had several teeth
knocked loose, but remained in the
i line-up.
After their mediocre showing
Wednesday, Bradshaw's "Reds,"
composed of mixed first and second
stringers, easily held their own
; against the third-string "Grays"
yesterday. The Reds lined up with
Bill Hawkins and A1 Schuman as
;encLs; Neal Sinclair and Byron West,
tackles; Frank McMillan and Lloyd
I Crowe, guards; Tony Mecia, center;
, Henry Glasser, quarter; Pete Fay
; and A1 Alustiza, halves; and Jordan
and Crowder, full.
Starting Linc-up
Most of the first-string bucked
the dummies under Walt Heinecke's
direction during the reserves' scrim
mage. Andy Stojkovich and Don
Butler should get the call again at
the fllank positions tomorrow, with
Hawkins, Irv Cummings, and pos
sibly Walt Hege, whose ankle is still
weak, to replace them.
Pete Zagar and Dave Carnahan
will start at tackles, with Fred Gus
tafson and either McMillan or John
West as guards. Dick Sutton at cen
ter, Bill Kirsch at right half, and
Wally deWitt at fullback are the
1 only other men who are at all cer
tain to start.
