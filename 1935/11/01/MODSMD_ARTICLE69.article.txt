## "Let the Winds of Freedom Blow" Member of the Associated Press Ex Committee's Compromise Seemingly Did Not Solve Problem of Reg Dances

Granting of the winter quarter Registration
Dance to Rain's Head society on a (>O-40 profit
sharing basis establishes an Ex Committee (
precedent in Hie awarding of so-called "gravy" j
to put Stanford honoraries on their financial 1
feet. A survey of the situation, however, indi- .
cates that Ibis policy deserves more thorough
consideration before it becomes too firmly ;
established.

The obvious question regarding sponsor- j
ship of Reg Dances: Should they be A.S.S.I'.-
sponsored, or should they be given in rotation ,
to subsidiary groups at Ex Committee's dis
cretion. The decision arrived at seemingly is
a compromise of the problem, rather than a
solution.
Since the student governors decided in favor
of granting future dances to honoraries and
similar organizations on a basis of need and
competency to handle the affairs, there appar- j
enlly is no logical reason for doing it only
half-way.
If one organization, for example, nets $150 j
on a Reg Dafiee when iis annual expenses j
amount to only *50, Ex Committee could re- ;
fuse to grant that group another date for
three years, instead of taking its $00 "cut" '
and then giving the Reg Dance to the same j
society the following year.
The policy of granting dates to honoraries

f will make for better-arranged dances, since
the organization that stands to gain naturally
will be more apt to get original numbers and
| give more concern to details than the more-or
' less disinterested Cardinals, who would plan
I , n
the affair if it were A.S.S.I .-sponsored.
Ex Committee, however, seemingly is gain-
J iug nothing by collecting its percentage. Sub
sidiary bodies that promote these dances,
j since they all are portions of the A.S.S.U.,
certainly would not be competing with Ex
Committee. On the contrary, their existence
and individual financial stability are a dis
tinct asset to the Associated Students as a
whole.
Eor the most part, the groups that would
I apply for the Reg Dance have no regular
; means of financially supporting themselves,
and the new arrangement will provide many
of them with an opportunity to earn expenses
essential to their existence.
This policy of granting Reg Dances to sub
j sidiary organizations of the A.S.S.U. is a sound
| one; but as long as the honoraries are to be
given the headache of arrangement and labor,
there seems to be little excuse for Ex Com
mittee, who does nothing but grant the dale,
i to collect its "cut" from one of its own indi-
I
vidual units. After all, the whole is the sum
of its parts.

The obvious question regarding sponsor- j
ship of Reg Dances: Should they be A.S.S.I'.-
sponsored, or should they be given in rotation ,
to subsidiary groups at Ex Committee's dis
cretion. The decision arrived at seemingly is
a compromise of the problem, rather than a
solution.
Since the student governors decided in favor
of granting future dances to honoraries and
similar organizations on a basis of need and
competency to handle the affairs, there appar- j
enlly is no logical reason for doing it only
half-way.
If one organization, for example, nets $150 j
on a Reg Dafiee when iis annual expenses j
amount to only *50, Ex Committee could re- ;
fuse to grant that group another date for
three years, instead of taking its $00 "cut" '
and then giving the Reg Dance to the same j
society the following year.
The policy of granting dates to honoraries

f will make for better-arranged dances, since
the organization that stands to gain naturally
will be more apt to get original numbers and
| give more concern to details than the more-or
' less disinterested Cardinals, who would plan
I , n
the affair if it were A.S.S.I .-sponsored.
Ex Committee, however, seemingly is gain-
J iug nothing by collecting its percentage. Sub
sidiary bodies that promote these dances,
j since they all are portions of the A.S.S.U.,
certainly would not be competing with Ex
Committee. On the contrary, their existence
and individual financial stability are a dis
tinct asset to the Associated Students as a
whole.
Eor the most part, the groups that would
I apply for the Reg Dance have no regular
; means of financially supporting themselves,
and the new arrangement will provide many
of them with an opportunity to earn expenses
essential to their existence.
This policy of granting Reg Dances to sub
j sidiary organizations of the A.S.S.U. is a sound
| one; but as long as the honoraries are to be
given the headache of arrangement and labor,
there seems to be little excuse for Ex Com
mittee, who does nothing but grant the dale,

I
