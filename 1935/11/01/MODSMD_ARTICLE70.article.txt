# Rooters' Tickets Might Sell Faster on Quad
## 
### 
Every football season the M.A.C. finds itself
unable to dispose of rooters' tickets for a full
section within the announced day of sale.
Every year the Daily has to announce the
li.A.C.'s decision to give the students a break
by extending and re-extending the sale.
"Wolf, wolf; buy 'em early" has come out
of the M.A.C. so long that it abets student
laziness rather than slopping it as the B.A.C.
itself would like lo do. The Daily is put into
the uncomfortable spot of having lo Irij to
fool its readers, because the M.A.C. whimsi
calv says, "Today's the Inst day"; and then
extends the sale a week on the following day.
Possibly one reason for the slow sales of
rooters' tickets is that the selling-booth is so
far rcifioved from the beaten track, especially
for women students. If the ticket-selling head
quarters could be moved onto the Quad, sales
might be speeded up. My having a temporary
booth that could be seen, sales days would be
noted. Then the students could buy more
readily, the M.A.C.. could profit from a more
rapid sale, with a sell-out possible within the
announced dead-line.
