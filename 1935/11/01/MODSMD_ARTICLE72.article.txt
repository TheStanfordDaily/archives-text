# Bull Session
## THE
						PUDDING PROOF 
### 
With the belief that most readers of Wednesday's
Bull Session would know what this writer meant by
Mrs. Average Reader, he included that term in a col
umn of dirt on campus dirt-dishers.
A day later yo Ed had received complaints from a
number of irate Palo Alto and campus housewives
who contended that this writer blamed them for in
directly creating a demand for nulty campus news.

We assumed that all women reading the column
would know that Mrs. Average Reader was a non
existent composite, the newsman's holy "She," whose
tastes and inclinations have been accurately pegged
by scores of advertising surveys. We also assumed thai
our protesters would recognize Mrs. Reader not as a
local type, but as a national one. Instead, they indi
cated a belief that this Bull Sessioncr was taking a
crack at the local matured lady. He was not.
He was merely attempting to point out the mechan
ics of campus correspondence in relation to adver
tising lineage and circulation, of necessity the cri
terion of a newspaper's success. He was also merely
recognizing the syllogism, proved and reproved, that
the nation's women do 85 per cent of the nation's
buying; that advertisers place their ads in papers thai
women read; that city editors, Q.E.D.. are doing their
best to interest women readers and get more and
larger advertising contracts and earn more money for
themselves and for the paper.

Right or wrong, the city editor believes that if
women read some of the news, they've got to read
some of the ads. Right or wrong, he is convinced
that significant news, the kind that makes morning
headlines, is dull to women readers. He is further
convinced that short, bright, interesting and freakish
news about love, emotional conflict, street waifs, juicy
divorces, and. le.st we forget, college students, consti
tute the sort of news women like.

Hence, the citv editor demands, and gets, that kind
of news. As campus correspondents, we do our best
to get the light and entertaining .stuff on collegians.
So far, the university, peopled as it is by young 'uns
who sometimes do erratic things, does not fit the re
quirement of a source of significant news.
The Bull Ses- ioner is mooing, or doing whatever a
Bull Sessioner does when he has his facts right. He
is himself a campus correspondent, and the material
of his questioned article was learned by him from many
fundamental and incontrovertible kicks-in-the-pants.
That, ladies, is that—l hope.
