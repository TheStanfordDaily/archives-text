Saturday, 2 p.m.—P.E. mid-term in Stanford
Stadium.
Some people think Our Hasher pretty dull stuff; so
I'm printing a bona fide contribution just to show how
bad it might, be:
Roble hasher, dark and tall,
From your throne you ought to fall,
Disillusionment now is due;
We'll reveal what we think of you.
Being snooty doesn't pay,
Wipe that sneer from off your face,
As you'll find out some sad, sad day
For you're a pint and not our case.
If this hashing is a pipe
Eat some food that doesn't gripe.
Have you a right to be so surly
Just because your hair is curly?
—Bored Freshwoman
