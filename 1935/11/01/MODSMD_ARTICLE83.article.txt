TODAY we're going to spend our
time telling you just how good a
show "Dark Tower" is. It seems
there was a diess rehearsal last
night, and your Reviewer attended
I it, much to his satisfaction. Take
our word for it, "Dark Tower" is
going to be one of the best shows
ever produced here.
Student direction of plays re-
I ccivcs a complete vindication.
Frank O'Neill seems to have
turned out an excellent piece of
entertainment. I tltink you'll sec
a really finished performance to
night.
By this time you all know that
it's a mystery melodrama, but there's
( plenty of comedy in it, too. Most
: of the latter is handled by Rose-
I mary Benet. although ono or two of
the other leads contribute their
share.

As for the mystery part, there's a
surprise ending that will strike you
as one of the cleverest pieces of
writing (and acting, too, the way
Fred Clark does it) you've seen in
a long time.
Student authorship is represented
in the song Robert Mallett sings in
the first act. It's called "Just I Love
You," and he wrote it himself. Di
rector Frank O'Neill lifted it from
the material submitted for the Gaie
ties and gave it a feature spot in the
play.
All this probably sounds like a lot
of publicty guff. But honest, it isn't.
If there are any punk shows around
here, we're not going to pull our
punches in saying so. But "Dark
Tower" honestly looks like a win
ner.
