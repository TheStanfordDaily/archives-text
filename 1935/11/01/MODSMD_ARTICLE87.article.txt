# Mud fight DOOMED?
## Dr. Storey Declares Mud Fight Unsanitary 
### 
After seeing to the treatment of
the seven wounded during the
fray, Dr Thomas A. Storey, medi
cal adviser for men, urged aboli
tion or modification of the fresh
man sophomore tradition, stating
A mud fight is out of place in a
university community .... The
1935 fight was characterized by

indecencies that would not be
tolerated in a town community
Skin lacerations and mud favor
serious wound infections. Dirty
water inhaled lavors respiratory
sinus, and middle ear infections
Newspapers and newsreels
spread embarrassing publicity all
over the country.!"
