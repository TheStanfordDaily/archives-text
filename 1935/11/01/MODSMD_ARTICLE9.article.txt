# Last of '500' Among Activities Leaders
## Fifty-two Women Remain From Class of 80 
### 
Who are the 500? Has anyone
ever heard of them? There are only
52 of them now extant on the Farm, ,
and they are the last Stanford
women who were taken into that
select group which has now been
supplanted by the 1100.
In 1932 the freshman women
checks payable" with a class of 80, j
as compared to this year's class of j
255 women. All that remains of I
the class of '36, who entered as 1
freshmen and who are still able to
uphold the "500" tradition, are 52 1
women in the senior class.
A rapid survey of the Bawlout
reveals that these women hold real
claim to membership in the 500,
who were chosen on a basis of |
high scholarship, prominence in
high-school activities, and on per
sonality. Of the 52 who have gone j
here all four years, only one is '
minus in the Bawlout, about half
have B minus averages, and the i
other half arc divided between j
A minus and B averages.
For most of them prominence in >
high school activities has been car- '
ried over to their life on the campus, j
Jackie Flanders is vice-president of j
I the A.S.S.U.; Mercedes Bergmann is
[ president of Women's Conference; i
; Jean Anderson is senior woman's j
j representative on Ex Committee;
j Barbara Steinbeck is president of i
j Cap and Gown; Jeanne Keesling is !
I president of Panhellenic; Jane >
! Dodge is women's editor of the;
| Daily; Edith Hind is vice-president I
| of the senior ciass; Dorothy Sweet j
i is chairman of the Women's Rally ;
j Committee; Virginia Johnson, Ma- !
| rie Eck, Barbara Snoke, and Doro- i
j thy Sweet are Roble sponsors.
Women's Council, the Quad, ■
| Y.W.C.A., the Daily, Masquers,
' and house organizations contain j
■ several members of the last class
of the 500 within their ranks.
So, reinforced by the feeling of I
I belonging to a tradition that is now '
I almost obliterated, "the last of the j
; 500" approach the beginning of the j
J end with a strong feeling of kinship I
j for one another and with plans for a
i last round-up before complete cx
i tinction.
