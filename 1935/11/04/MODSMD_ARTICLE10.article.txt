# 'Dark Tower' Rated Outstanding Play
## 
### PHIL BERNHEIM 
Your Reviewer is laughing up his
sleeve this morning at most of Stan
ford—all, in fact, but the pitifully
small number who witnessed Friday
night's performance of "The Dark
Tower," for it was one of the best
plays presented here in recent years.
Perhaps the final test of a com
pany of amateurs is their ability to
carry off unforeseen and untoward
accidents. And the ''Dark Tower"
company came through admirahly
wlien Friday's storm cut off As
sembly Ilall current and left the
theater dark.
Fred Clark gave an outstanding
performance in the difficult double
roles of Damon Wells and Max Sar
noff. I don't believe anyone unfa
miliar with the play knew that Clark
was playing both parts until the de
nouement, and that means he was
successful.
Robert Gatred had an easy and
convincing manner. He seemed
quite at home on the stage, show
ing no trace of amateur uneasiness.
Phyllis Corson, in the feminine
lead role of Jessica Wells, was
beautiful, but her voice has no
emotional range. Even when she
said, "I'm wonderfully happy," she
sounded as if she were about to
burst into tears.
Charles Corker was overly dra
matic as Jessica's Svengali-like hus
band, Stanley Vance. He so loaded
his voice with unctious villainy that
at times it grew indistinct. Not
really bad, he was just too eager to
be good.
Robert Mallett was excellent, as
the almost adolescent playwright,
basking in the stage atmosphere.
Excellent, also, was his tune, "Just
I Love You," which he sang in the
first act.
Jean Albcrtson carried off the
part of Jessica's maiden aunt quite
well, only her voice betraying
youth. Harold Kahn and Arthur
Spaulding seemed too young for
their parts, though the former
supplied some good humor. Fritzi
Kolstcr was adequate as the young
actress on the make, and 'minor
roles were filled by Betty Wat
kins and Paul Crary.
Frank O'Neill's direction was
smoothly paced and the production
was a credit to O'Neill and to student
play direction. Phil Brown's two
good sets were decided assets, the
hotel room being ingeniously •"flown"
(a decided feat for the Assembly
Hall). The Stanford Concert Orches
tra under the direction of Myron
Birnbaum, better than last year,
played overture and entr' acts.

sleeve this morning at most of Stan
ford—all, in fact, but the pitifully
small number who witnessed Friday
night's performance of "The Dark
Tower," for it was one of the best
plays presented here in recent years.
Perhaps the final test of a com
pany of amateurs is their ability to
carry off unforeseen and untoward
accidents. And the ''Dark Tower"
company came through admirahly
wlien Friday's storm cut off As
sembly Ilall current and left the
theater dark.
Fred Clark gave an outstanding
performance in the difficult double
roles of Damon Wells and Max Sar
noff. I don't believe anyone unfa
miliar with the play knew that Clark
was playing both parts until the de
nouement, and that means he was
successful.
Robert Gatred had an easy and
convincing manner. He seemed
quite at home on the stage, show
ing no trace of amateur uneasiness.
Phyllis Corson, in the feminine
lead role of Jessica Wells, was
beautiful, but her voice has no
emotional range. Even when she
said, "I'm wonderfully happy," she
sounded as if she were about to
burst into tears.
Charles Corker was overly dra
matic as Jessica's Svengali-like hus
band, Stanley Vance. He so loaded
his voice with unctious villainy that
at times it grew indistinct. Not
really bad, he was just too eager to
be good.
Robert Mallett was excellent, as
the almost adolescent playwright,
basking in the stage atmosphere.
Excellent, also, was his tune, "Just
I Love You," which he sang in the
first act.
Jean Albcrtson carried off the
part of Jessica's maiden aunt quite
well, only her voice betraying
youth. Harold Kahn and Arthur
Spaulding seemed too young for
their parts, though the former
supplied some good humor. Fritzi
Kolstcr was adequate as the young
actress on the make, and 'minor
roles were filled by Betty Wat
kins and Paul Crary.
Frank O'Neill's direction was
smoothly paced and the production
was a credit to O'Neill and to student
play direction. Phil Brown's two
good sets were decided assets, the
hotel room being ingeniously •"flown"
(a decided feat for the Assembly
Hall). The Stanford Concert Orches
tra under the direction of Myron
Birnbaum, better than last year,
played overture and entr' acts.
