### 
NEW YORK, Nov. 3 (JP). â€” Mrs.
Margaret di Donato, 39, and her
Jive children were burned to death
early today when an incendiary
fire swept through an East Harlem
"old law" tenement building.
The father, Louis di Donato, told
police he ran panic stricken from
the apartment to seek help at the
first cries of fire.
Spectacular rescues by firemen
who clambered up 85-foot ladders
saved the lives of another family
of three in the same building.
