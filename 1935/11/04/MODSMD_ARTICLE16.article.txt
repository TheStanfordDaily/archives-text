# Gaieties Schedule Tryouts for Today
## 
### 
Further tryouts for the Big Game
Gaieties will be held this afternoon
at 4 o'clock in the Assembly Hall,
accoi'ding to General Director Frank
O'Neill.
More singers, more specialty acts,
and more skits are needed, says
O'Neill. But skits that have already
been rejected definitely should not
be resubmitted, he stressed.
The Gaieties will be filled with
many good tunes, according to Fred
Nagel and Gordy Heche, associate
musical directors. Arrangements
have been made to have the tunes
plugged in a San Francisco hotel and
over the NBC radio network.
