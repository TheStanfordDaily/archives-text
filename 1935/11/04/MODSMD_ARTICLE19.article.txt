# Willis Reports New Theory on Quakes
## 
### 
Incipient mountain-building mec'n
| anisms were the cause of last week's
J quakes in eastern United States and
Canada explained Bailey Willis,
Stanford's emeritus professor of
geology and famed earthquake au
, thority, in an interview with the
Associated Press yesterday.
"We arc in the phase of mountain
building, now in its geological in
i fancy, which can be dangerous," said
Dr. Willis. "No one can say any
area is safe, but don't be seared.
Build, and build right."
Force Widely Distributed
Under the Stanford professor's
theory of the quakes, there is an
j earthquake mechanism deep under
i the Atlantic seaboard that distrib
utes the force of mountain-building
\ shocks over a great territory. The
I violence of shocks in western areas
is explained by a different mech
anism.
The energy which may cause the
monutain building and resulting
earthquakes inÂ»the east Willis attrib
| uted to radio-active stoves deep in
',1110 earth, heating the deep rocks,
and causing molecular strains.
"We are dealing there with a very
; slow development," he said. "On the
theory which I think sound, ocean
basins are dynamic areas which at
the same time have had periods of
very great activity."
Dr. Willis explained that the Ap
palachian mountain rocks were fold

| Ed up into the present range when
the energy of the Atlantic ocean ac
tivity became exhausted and left its
j evidence in mountain building.
"Earthquakes result from the ac
cumulation of strain in elastic rocks,
i The maximum strain possible is the
| force that will break the rocks.
Force Released Slowly
i "If the force is released very
slowly and at a considerable depth,
j as I believe occurred on the Atlantic
j seaboard last week, you get a large
! amount of force stored up before the
rocks break or jump. When this
| jump occurs, it releases a large
j amount of energy and shakes a large
; amount of country."
If the force accumulates rapidly
| and near the surface (10 miles deep
is geologically "near"), the noled
Stanford geologist said, the shocks
occur more frequently, violently,
land more locally. The disastrous
Long Beach shock in 1933 was caused
by a mechanism which, unlike the
one back of last week's Atlantic
quakes, was small and vicious.
The source of the energy which
i compresses ihe rocks, according to
Dr. Willis' theory, is not the pressure
of gravitation but the more powerful
molecular force in rock erlstals. Due
to certain processes rock masses ex
pand horizontally and force the
I crust upward. This is the force
which raises mountains and produces
I earthquakes.
