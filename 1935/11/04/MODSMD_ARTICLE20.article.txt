# Sportswriter Gives Complete Retraction
## 
### 
A complete retraction of his charge '
that Frank Alustiza was hospital- j
ized not for an eye injury but be- !
cause of injured feelings between the
convalescing gridder and Bobby
Grayson, was published Saturday in ,
the "On the Level" column of the
Long Beach Press-Telegram, Art
Cohn, sportswriter, informed The
Daily yesterday.
"Believe me, there was no
malice in my heart, so I cannot
apologize for being 'maliciously
libelous,' as your friends insist I
was," he wrote in an open letter
addressed to Frank Alustiza at the
Stanford Hospital. As for opera
tive "T-23," who reported the of
fending statement, he has been
fired, Cohn said.
Included was an apology to Bobby
Grayson, equally concerned in the
former false, possibly libelous state
ments.
Meanwhile Alfred E. Masters,
manager of the Board of Athletic
Control, preferred that the whole |
matter of accusation and apology be
dropped. This was in direct contra
diction to his statement Friday, is
sued on receipt of a letter from
Charlie Paddock, former "world's
fastest human" and business man
ager of the Long Beach paper, which
admitted that Cohn had "gone of!
half-cocked." At that time, Masters
deemed the apology "not an accept
able answer" since it gave no rea
sons for printing charges of trouble
between Grayson and Alustiza.
Whether the Stanford official had
received a further communication |
could not be learned by The Daily
last night.
The original article charging dis
sension between Stanford's all-
American and the injured half
back was printed in the paper's
"On the Level" column of Octo
ber 22. "Stanford authorities will
deny this," the item stated, "but
it was not an eye ailment that
forced Frank Alustiza to quit
football.
"Last April, I exclusively re
ported that Alustiza and Bobby
Grayson had a fist fight during
spring practice. Bad blood has al
ways existed between the two :
backs. The team was torn by '
dissension and the U.C.LA. whip- '
ping was the last straw. Either
Grayson or Alustiza had to go. !
Bobby was more valuable so he |
stayed. That's why Alustiza sud- j
denly became blind."
The apology printed on today's
editorial page was in response to a '
letter written to Cohn by Bob Jones, J
Daily editor, under authorization of i
the Executive Committee.

American and the injured half
back was printed in the paper's
"On the Level" column of Octo
ber 22. "Stanford authorities will
deny this," the item stated, "but
it was not an eye ailment that
forced Frank Alustiza to quit
football.
"Last April, I exclusively re
ported that Alustiza and Bobby
Grayson had a fist fight during
spring practice. Bad blood has al
ways existed between the two :
backs. The team was torn by '
dissension and the U.C.LA. whip- '
ping was the last straw. Either
Grayson or Alustiza had to go. !
Bobby was more valuable so he |
stayed. That's why Alustiza sud- j
denly became blind."
The apology printed on today's
editorial page was in response to a '
letter written to Cohn by Bob Jones, J
Daily editor, under authorization of i
the Executive Committee.
A complete retraction of his charge '
that Frank Alustiza was hospital- j
ized not for an eye injury but be- !
cause of injured feelings between the
convalescing gridder and Bobby
Grayson, was published Saturday in ,
the "On the Level" column of the
Long Beach Press-Telegram, Art
Cohn, sportswriter, informed The
Daily yesterday.
"Believe me, there was no
malice in my heart, so I cannot
apologize for being 'maliciously
libelous,' as your friends insist I
was," he wrote in an open letter
addressed to Frank Alustiza at the
Stanford Hospital. As for opera
tive "T-23," who reported the of
fending statement, he has been
fired, Cohn said.
Included was an apology to Bobby
Grayson, equally concerned in the
former false, possibly libelous state
ments.
Meanwhile Alfred E. Masters,
manager of the Board of Athletic
Control, preferred that the whole |
matter of accusation and apology be
dropped. This was in direct contra
diction to his statement Friday, is
sued on receipt of a letter from
Charlie Paddock, former "world's
fastest human" and business man
ager of the Long Beach paper, which
admitted that Cohn had "gone of!
half-cocked." At that time, Masters
deemed the apology "not an accept
able answer" since it gave no rea
sons for printing charges of trouble
between Grayson and Alustiza.
Whether the Stanford official had
received a further communication |
could not be learned by The Daily
last night.
The original article charging dis
sension between Stanford's all-
American and the injured half
back was printed in the paper's
"On the Level" column of Octo
