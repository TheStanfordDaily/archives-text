# Cohn Letter Answers Bad Blood Charge
## 
### 
Art Cohn, Long Beach Press-
Telegram sports columnist, who
last week spoke of "bad blood"
between Frankie Alustiza and
Bobby Grayson, forwards the
following letter of apology which
appeared in his column in Satur
day's Telegram.
Mr. Frank Alustiza,
Stanford Hospital,
San Francisco, Calif.
Dear Alustiza:
With mingled emotions I write
you—delighted that the operation to
restore vision to your right eye was
successful, and regretful that I un
wittingly contributed to doing you a
grave injustice.
It seems that everyone that at
tended Stanford is now demanding
an apology and retraction for a note
that appeared in my column Octo
ber 22. I have heard from every
resident in Palo Alto except the
only two persons involved—you and
your friend, Bobby Grayson.
About 2000 years ago Cicero said:
"Any man may make a mistake;
but a fool will stick to it." I made
a mistake in printing the report that
bad blood, inflamed by a fist fight
between you and Grayson last
spring, forced you to quit football.
Every Northern California news
paper that printed the story (and
from the size of my pan mail the
last few days, not a single daily or
weekly missed it!) deleted one line
that prefaced the item.
The line read: "Confidential Report
from Operative T-23." The much
quoted "insult" was his report.
Operative T-23 was one of the
most reliable correspondents I ever
had at Stanford University. You
note I say "was." He "is" no more.
Operative T-23 has been fired.
It is my business to report what
I see and what I hear, Alustiza.
