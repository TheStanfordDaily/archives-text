# Cohn Letter Answers Bad Blood Charge
## 
### 
Art Cohn, Long Beach Press-
Telegram sports columnist, who
last week spoke of "bad blood"
between Frankie Alustiza and
Bobby Grayson, forwards the
following letter of apology which
appeared in his column in Satur
day's Telegram.
Mr. Frank Alustiza,
Stanford Hospital,
San Francisco, Calif.
Dear Alustiza:
With mingled emotions I write
you—delighted that the operation to
restore vision to your right eye was
successful, and regretful that I un
wittingly contributed to doing you a
grave injustice.
It seems that everyone that at
tended Stanford is now demanding
an apology and retraction for a note
that appeared in my column Octo
ber 22. I have heard from every
resident in Palo Alto except the
only two persons involved—you and
your friend, Bobby Grayson.
About 2000 years ago Cicero said:
"Any man may make a mistake;
but a fool will stick to it." I made
a mistake in printing the report that
bad blood, inflamed by a fist fight
between you and Grayson last
spring, forced you to quit football.
Every Northern California news
paper that printed the story (and
from the size of my pan mail the
last few days, not a single daily or
weekly missed it!) deleted one line
that prefaced the item.
The line read: "Confidential Report
from Operative T-23." The much
quoted "insult" was his report.
Operative T-23 was one of the
most reliable correspondents I ever
had at Stanford University. You
note I say "was." He "is" no more.
Operative T-23 has been fired.
It is my business to report what
I see and what I hear, Alustiza.
| For many months 1 have heard
! rumors of internal dissension on
! the Stanford squad. . . .
I could quote the names of a half
dozen well known players you and
I know very well who have told
me that there was a rift in the
Stanford ranks, but I will spare
them the trouble of denying they
! said it. I take full responsibility
for printing the "Confidential Re
port of Operative T-23."
My only sin, Alustiza, was in not
verifying the story. But if a news
j paper had to confirm every line
| that went into print, it would be
unable to publish one edition a
; month, let alone several daily.
I I made the error of placing too
I much confidence in the word of
j Operative T-23 because he had
\ always been authentic in the past.
That was my mistake, and I re
■ gret it. But I cannot apologize for
; being "maliciously libelous," as
j your friends insist I was. Believe
i me, there was no malice in my
I heart.
And why shouldn't I have be
i lieved Operative T-23? Seven
months ago he told me of an al
leged fist fight between you and
Grayson. I printed that in April.
It must have been as "maliciously
libelous" then as it is now. But
there were NO DENIALS. Not a
I single protest! On hearing the
same story, then, seven months
later, I took it for granted as being
true.
Under the identical circum
| stances, you might have done the
| same thing, Alustiza.
The present teapot tempest be
! came a melodrama the day you went
i to the hospital. Because you're so
| popular at Stanford, and rightfully
j so, the kids and the coaches and the
! officials were gripped by a senti
mental hysteria. Not that I blame
I them. But making me the dastardly
j villain of the piece for everything,
; except, perhaps, the licking by
! U.C.L.A., was a bit out of propor
tion.
I If only to satisfy the wire services
! that are demanding statements hour
j ly, I Want to state here and now that
as far as I know: (1) You and Gray
] son have always been greater pals
than Damon and Pythias; (2) That
neither of you has ever lifted your
fists to a soul; (3) That the Stanford
squad has always been one happy
family; (4) That the operation on
your eye was bona fide in every
way; (5) That Stanford is the finest
| college in the world; (6) That A1
j Masters is the greatest living grad-
I uate manager; (7) That 1 will be

cheering for Stanford to lick the
Trojans 98-0, a week from today;
(8) That I am so ashamed of myself
for starting the whole rumpus that I
would quit the newspaper racket
forever, if I could find honest work.
Every few minutes the postman
| brings a new bundle of "official"
| demands for apologies and retrac
| tions. When you get well, Alustiza,
j you ought to run for mayor. If you
| get as many votes as I received let

ters, nobody can beat you.
What more can I say, Alustiza?
Tell Grayson when lie comes to
visit you today, that the same sen
timents I expressed to you go
double for him. If both of you
will forgive and forget, the rest of
Palo Alto will have to he satisfied.
Trusting that your recovery will he
swift and complete. I am,
Apologetkvrily yours,
Art Cohn
