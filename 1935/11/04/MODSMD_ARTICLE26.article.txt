MOSCOW, Nov. 3 (/P). â€”Discovery
that a warm current from the At
lantic ocean penetrates Arctic re
gions as far east as Wrangel Island,
only 500 miles from Bering Strait,
was announced today after investi
gations by Soviet scientists aboard
the ice breaker Krassin.
A current had already been dis
covered, 1700 miles to the west, be
tween Northland and Franz Josef

pressed the belief the current may
traverse the whoie northern sea
route from Europe to the Far East.
