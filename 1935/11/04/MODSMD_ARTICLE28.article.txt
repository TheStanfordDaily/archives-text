# Trojan Coach Gives Indians Edge After Seeing Bronco Win
## Howard Jones Picks Cards To Defeat U.S.C. By Two Touchdowns Fear Overconfidence Hamilton Expected Back At Practice Today 
### GORDY FROST Daily Sports Editor 
"Stanford has a two touchdown
j edge over us—at least."
It was Coach Howard Jones
| speaking just after he, and three
' other members of the Trojan staff,
I had watched Stanford squeeze
1 through to a 9-6 victory over Santa
| Clara's Broncos last Saturday.
But for Stanford to take those
! words too seriously is folly. For un
doubtedly Mr. Jones spoke them
with the hope that a tribe of In
! dians would invade the southland
| next week so sure of victory that
they could be upset.
Last week-end overconfidence
almost upset the tboggan. Santa
Clara put a fine team on the field,
a line that played better football
than did Stanford's, a hack field
that was hut slightly inferior to
Stanford's.
"We were lucky to win," was the
way Tiny Thornhill surmised the
situation. "And we've got a lot of
i work to do yet," were his further
! words.
Bones Hamilton is expected to
return to the practice field this
afternoon to pive his pulled muscle
another test. lie hopes it will show
enough strength to let him play
at full ability against Montana, if
not next Saturday.
Bob Grayson, back in his hospital
bed over the week-end, was out to
day but will not work out this after
noon. Larry Rouble will be back in
j suit, limbering his bad knee. Gray
-1 son was the only man injured last
Saturday.
Cards Make Come-back
All last week Stanford fought
against overconfidence. But the ap
pearance of that slow first quarter
indicated that there was still some
lof that element present. It was not
till after the half that the Indians
| had that spark and fire that won at
i Seattle two weeks ago.
But when Stanford really got un
; der way with a 6-point Santa Clara
| lead already chalked up, the situa
tion took on shades of Washington.
Bobby Grayson was getting
' through the line despite the slim
J holes, Joe Vigna was snagging passe ,
| big Horse Reynolds was playing a
| good line game, and Monk Moscrip
| was looking truly "all-American" at
his end.
But earlier it was a different
color. Santa Clara swept the In
dian ends for gains on the first
half dozen plays, Stanford lost
| yardage. The Indian wobbled.
Then came the Bronc score. Hal
Seramin intercepted Grayson's pass
to Vigna on the 15-yard line and
j proceeded to romp the field length
for the score. The conversion attempt
was wide.
So it stood, 6-0, until later in the
quarter Bob Matthews recovered
\ Kaliski's fumble on the Santa Clara
; 32. A pass, Grayson to Coffis, carried
iit to the 8 but a 15-yard holding
penalty took it right back again.
An exchange of punts and Stanford
regained possession of the ball on
the Santa Clara 24. Grayson's old
! ankle injury struck again and
Bobby was carried out of the bail
j game.
But Ray Todd had experience in
Grayson's shoes at Washington last
| week and he looked like a veteran in
j them again Saturday when he faded
' back, confidently shot a pass to Jim
j Coffis, who was dropped on the 3.
Bill Paulman cracked center twice
j to tally; Moserip missed the kick.
I So it was that Stanford left at the
I half with the scoreboard reading
6-6. Tiny Thornhill said a few
j things during the rest time that
i seemed to take effect and it was a
i team filled with "Wax Washington"
j spirit that played the rest of that
! game.
| To hold an opponent on the
; one-yard line is no easy task. They
; did it But it was partly through
j poor Santa Clara field generalship
i —running the ends when Falasehi
| was probably good for one-yard a
try at center—that staved off the
Bronc attack.
To drive 77 yards through a pow
l erful Bronc line to the winning field
I goal is no simple job. Still they did
it. To kick a field goal under such
pressure is no cinch. But Moserip
did it.
And then as the game nears an
' end to drop Kalaschi on his own 3-
! yard line after Wes Muller had in
tercepted his third pass in two games,
i was football to be scoffed
I at. But with Troy and Montana and
! Cal ahead, that kind of play must
i not be confined to but one half of
j the bail pine.

Last week-end overconfidence
almost upset the tboggan. Santa
Clara put a fine team on the field,
a line that played better football
than did Stanford's, a hack field
that was hut slightly inferior to
Stanford's.
"We were lucky to win," was the
way Tiny Thornhill surmised the

Bones Hamilton is expected to

Bob Grayson, back in his hospital

day but will not work out this after
noon. Larry Rouble will be back in
j suit, limbering his bad knee. Gray
-1 son was the only man injured last
Saturday.
Cards Make Come-back
All last week Stanford fought
against overconfidence. But the ap
pearance of that slow first quarter
indicated that there was still some
lof that element present. It was not
till after the half that the Indians
| had that spark and fire that won at
i Seattle two weeks ago.
But when Stanford really got un
; der way with a 6-point Santa Clara
| lead already chalked up, the situa
tion took on shades of Washington.
Bobby Grayson was getting
' through the line despite the slim
J holes, Joe Vigna was snagging passe ,
| big Horse Reynolds was playing a
| good line game, and Monk Moscrip
| was looking truly "all-American" at
his end.
But earlier it was a different
color. Santa Clara swept the In
dian ends for gains on the first
half dozen plays, Stanford lost
| yardage. The Indian wobbled.
Then came the Bronc score. Hal
Seramin intercepted Grayson's pass
to Vigna on the 15-yard line and
j proceeded to romp the field length
for the score. The conversion attempt
was wide.
So it stood, 6-0, until later in the
quarter Bob Matthews recovered
\ Kaliski's fumble on the Santa Clara
; 32. A pass, Grayson to Coffis, carried
iit to the 8 but a 15-yard holding
penalty took it right back again.
An exchange of punts and Stanford
regained possession of the ball on
the Santa Clara 24. Grayson's old
! ankle injury struck again and
Bobby was carried out of the bail
j game.
But Ray Todd had experience in
Grayson's shoes at Washington last
| week and he looked like a veteran in
j them again Saturday when he faded
' back, confidently shot a pass to Jim
j Coffis, who was dropped on the 3.
Bill Paulman cracked center twice
j to tally; Moserip missed the kick.
I So it was that Stanford left at the
I half with the scoreboard reading
6-6. Tiny Thornhill said a few
j things during the rest time that
i seemed to take effect and it was a
i team filled with "Wax Washington"
j spirit that played the rest of that
! game.
| To hold an opponent on the
; one-yard line is no easy task. They
; did it But it was partly through
j poor Santa Clara field generalship
i —running the ends when Falasehi
| was probably good for one-yard a

"Stanford has a two touchdown
j edge over us—at least."
It was Coach Howard Jones
| speaking just after he, and three
' other members of the Trojan staff,
I had watched Stanford squeeze
1 through to a 9-6 victory over Santa
| Clara's Broncos last Saturday.
But for Stanford to take those
! words too seriously is folly. For un
doubtedly Mr. Jones spoke them
with the hope that a tribe of In
! dians would invade the southland
| next week so sure of victory that
they could be upset.
Last week-end overconfidence
almost upset the tboggan. Santa
Clara put a fine team on the field,
a line that played better football
than did Stanford's, a hack field
that was hut slightly inferior to
Stanford's.
"We were lucky to win," was the
way Tiny Thornhill surmised the
situation. "And we've got a lot of
i work to do yet," were his further
! words.
Bones Hamilton is expected to
return to the practice field this
afternoon to pive his pulled muscle
another test. lie hopes it will show
enough strength to let him play
at full ability against Montana, if
not next Saturday.
Bob Grayson, back in his hospital
bed over the week-end, was out to
day but will not work out this after
noon. Larry Rouble will be back in
j suit, limbering his bad knee. Gray
-1 son was the only man injured last
Saturday.
Cards Make Come-back
All last week Stanford fought
against overconfidence. But the ap
pearance of that slow first quarter
indicated that there was still some
lof that element present. It was not
till after the half that the Indians
| had that spark and fire that won at
i Seattle two weeks ago.
But when Stanford really got un
; der way with a 6-point Santa Clara
| lead already chalked up, the situa
tion took on shades of Washington.
Bobby Grayson was getting
' through the line despite the slim
J holes, Joe Vigna was snagging passe ,
| big Horse Reynolds was playing a
| good line game, and Monk Moscrip
| was looking truly "all-American" at
his end.
But earlier it was a different
color. Santa Clara swept the In
dian ends for gains on the first
half dozen plays, Stanford lost
| yardage. The Indian wobbled.
Then came the Bronc score. Hal
Seramin intercepted Grayson's pass
to Vigna on the 15-yard line and
j proceeded to romp the field length
for the score. The conversion attempt
was wide.
So it stood, 6-0, until later in the
quarter Bob Matthews recovered
\ Kaliski's fumble on the Santa Clara
; 32. A pass, Grayson to Coffis, carried
iit to the 8 but a 15-yard holding
penalty took it right back again.
An exchange of punts and Stanford
regained possession of the ball on
the Santa Clara 24. Grayson's old
! ankle injury struck again and
Bobby was carried out of the bail
j game.
But Ray Todd had experience in
Grayson's shoes at Washington last
| week and he looked like a veteran in
j them again Saturday when he faded
' back, confidently shot a pass to Jim
j Coffis, who was dropped on the 3.
Bill Paulman cracked center twice
j to tally; Moserip missed the kick.
I So it was that Stanford left at the
I half with the scoreboard reading
6-6. Tiny Thornhill said a few
