# MEET CANCELLED
## 
### 
Because of unfavorable weather
conditions it was necessary to can
cel Tri-Sports Day. The hockey
field at Mills College, where the
meet was scheduled, was too muddy
to use. There is a possibility that the
annual competition between Mills,
California, and Stanford Universities
may take place in the spring.
