"A tremendous victory, a tremen
dous victory. Our boys were in there
fighting every minute," said Coach
Roach Drofnats, of the Stanford
Daily griddleteam.
Coach Drofnats was referring to
The Daily's spectacular 6-6 victory
over the Whapan-al Whaff, between
! acts Saturday afternoon.
The Coach was also referring to
his 100 per cent predictions over the
week-end, which ended up as 75 per
cent predictions by the time the
teams got through messing up their
schedules.
"Due to the fact that rain pre-
I vented adequate practice, bad blood
j and dissension were rife among the
| two teams, and nasty words were ex
! changed in the huddle."
"Boy boys were really playing un
der wraps. Yeh, I thought it was kind
I of a wrappy game myself."
