# 60 Mile Gale Causes Destruction on Campus
## 
### R. B. Jones 
At 60 miles an hour last Friday
night's gale swept the peninsula.
The campus was startled the next
morning to find trees stretched over
roads, fences, and other things more
valuable.
Herman Coons witnessed the
greatest destruction when he found
a large tree draped across his auto
mobile completely crushing the top.
The storm resulted in no human
catastrophes, but several of the
windows in Toyon Hall and other
residences about the campus were
smashed under the wind's blast.
These were but a few of the acci
dents left in the wake of the stonn.
All of the little time-abiding re
sorts along the highway waxed "old
fashioned" by necessity and resorted
to candlelight where light was
needed.
The first act of "Dark Tower" and
an entire film in a downtown theater
were intermittently interrupted by
loss of electric power and were only
corrected by the use of a main power
line.
The peak of the blow was reached
at about 10 o'clock, when it sub
sided, and the cold gloom of the
aftermorn was the curtain.
