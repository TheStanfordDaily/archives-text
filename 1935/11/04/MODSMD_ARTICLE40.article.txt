Chappie chef, sent the news
that Winstead Weaver has been
added to the staff of the maga
zine. ,
Though some of the effective
ness of the announcement may
have been partly lost due to
weather conditions, the fact re
mains that Weaver will be

as he slyly cleaved a walnut

will feature many, many more
