"HAILE SELASSIE"
WIRES STANFORD
Frank Alustiza didn't forget Stan
lord last Saturday. He sent a tele
gram to the team just before that
Santa Clara scare that might have
had a lot to do with the outcome
of that Bronc affair.
But first, to make the signa
ture that Frank tabbed to his wire
completely clear, just a word about
that monicker. It seems that Frank
is mighty susceptible to a com
mon football pastime—nicknam
ing. He's been called "Owl Eyes,' 1
"Bounding Basque" or some such
name ever since his prep school
grid days.
Just before that fateful eye in
jury, the team joshed him with
"Haile Selassie Alustiza" because of
his dark complexion. So he came
right back—and made 'em eat the
words.

Hand Man Frank
Stanford didn't forget Frank Sat
urday either. In fact, Stanford need
ed Alustiza's flawless blocking des
perately at times. Not to reflect on
the work of little Joe Vigna. Joe
was there to catch the passes that
paved the way to Stanford's vic
tory, but in bloeking'and driving the
line and quick kicking Frank was
missed a plenty.
THEY CAPITALIZED
ON A CHANCE
Did you notice Swede Carlson and
Bob Matthews showing their stuff
in that line Saturday? Eob Grayson
did. He's of the opinion that those
fellows played some mighty good
ball, that they showed Tiny that they
are plenty anxious to play first
string football.
Swede, in for Dale Beedle at
tackle, was handling his blocking
assignments in nearly perfect man
ner. Defensively he kept the
tackle spot closed tight as a drum.
Matthews at guard for Bob Black,
who in turn was in for Larry Rouble,
did a great job of "ball hawking"
along with a good blocking game. It
was Matthews, who recovered Santa
Clara's fumbie that led to Stanford's
precious score.

Saturday marked the second
time that Bob has proven that
he's not at all satisfied with a sec
ond or third-string tackle berth.
Up north against Washington he
played for just a few minutes but
during that time showed more
than ordinary ability.
Tiny Thornhill told him last Sat
urday as he started out on the field,
"No pussy-footing around, Bob."
And he followed his boss's advice,
both last week-end and this.
