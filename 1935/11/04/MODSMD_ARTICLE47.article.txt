# Soccer Squad Loses to U.S.F.
## 
### 
Stanford's soccer team had the
double misfortune last Saturday
morning of running into the best
soccer team on the Pacific Coast on
its best day and lost to the Univer
sity of San Francisco 6-1.
The northerners, led by Scotty
Gordon, showed one of the most
spectacular and efficient offenses
ever seen on the local campus. Their
ball play was clever and their shots
accurate and deadly.
Coach Dick Bullis' new line-up
experiment, of sacrificing defense to
favor offense, however, seemed to
fail or to have been tried in the
wrong game.
