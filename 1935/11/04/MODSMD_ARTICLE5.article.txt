# Few Tickets Left for First Farm Concert
## Tito Schipa, Tenor, Sings Wednesday Night 
### 
With only 800 tickets still avail
able, a complete sellout is expected
for the Tito Schipa concert in the
Encina Pavilion Wednesday night,
Naomi Carpenter, concert series
manager, announced last night.
His Stanford concert, which opens
the 1935-36 Concert Series, is Schi
pa's only Pacific Coast appearance
this year. Premier lyric tenor of the
Metropolitan and Chicago opera
companies, Schipa is acclaimed by
critics everywhere as the country's
most popular operatic tenor.
Schipa's popularity lies largely in
his choice of the best-liked classical
favorites and his flawless technique.
Though usually playing the lover
role, Schipa includes a wide range
of types in his programs.
Other artists on the season's con
cert series are the Vienna Choir
Boys; Jascha Heifetz, violinist; Nel
son Eddy, baritone; and Trudi
Schoop with her comic ballet. A few
season tickets are still on sale.
