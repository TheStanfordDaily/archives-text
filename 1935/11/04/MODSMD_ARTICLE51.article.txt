# Stanford's Rose Bowl Chances Depend On the Way Remaining Games Are Won
## 
### 
With a 14 to 2 victory over U.C.L.A., Cali
fornia marched toward the Rose Bowl Satur
day. And with a line that was partly out
played and with much question as to who
"should have won," Stanford rolled toward ,
the Big Game and a Rose Bowl possibility.
Stanford's team, seemingly a bit disinter- i
ested in the week-end proceedings, now finds !
itself in a bit better light as far as the Pasa- |
dena pickings are concerned, although the !
selection is slill wide open to four teams — I
Stanford, California, U.C.L.A., and Washing- ;
ton.
Saturday's only-fair showing against Santa j
Clara was obviously the result of a let-down, I
on the part of both the Indian team and the
Stanford student body. After the "victory !
drive" that proved so successful against !
Washington the week before, Stanford de- ;
cided lo climb aboard the "Big Red Tobog- j
gan" and save her energies for the Big Game |
as she breezed through "slight opposition" ]
by the Broncos, I'.S.C., and Montana.
From the Rose Bowl standpoint, that type j
of play and support would have been excus
able —provided the Indians eventually won ,
each game—except for the fact that Stanford
had already lost to U.C.L.A.

I'nder the circumstances, the Indians must
not only win all three remaining games, but
they will be required to defeat each team in
a manner that leaves no doubt as to relative
merits. Otherwise, Conference officials, who
for nearly two years have been searching for
a chance to give the bid to a team with a
better percentage of Pasadena victories, will
waste little time in selecting the best of the
other three teams still in the race.
From last week on through November 2.'},
the Indians are being graded on score, team
work, ability displayed, light, and spirit
not on victories, since it is understood they
must win all of their games. Saturday's per
formance rates approximately a "C," which
is about class average.
Unless all three of the remaining games are
an entirely convincing display of Indian spirit,
kept relatively dormant all year—except (hir
ing the week of the Washington g;une—by
both team and student body, the final gun of
the California game will bring to a close the
careers of "the greatest group of football play
ers in Stanford history"—without even giving
them a chance to redeem two Rose Bowl de
bacles.
The Pasadena "light is slill on, but last
week's round hardly goes to Stanford.

From the Rose Bowl standpoint, that type j
of play and support would have been excus
able —provided the Indians eventually won ,
each game—except for the fact that Stanford
had already lost to U.C.L.A.

I'nder the circumstances, the Indians must
not only win all three remaining games, but
they will be required to defeat each team in
a manner that leaves no doubt as to relative
merits. Otherwise, Conference officials, who
for nearly two years have been searching for
a chance to give the bid to a team with a
better percentage of Pasadena victories, will
waste little time in selecting the best of the
other three teams still in the race.
From last week on through November 2.'},
the Indians are being graded on score, team
work, ability displayed, light, and spirit
not on victories, since it is understood they
must win all of their games. Saturday's per
formance rates approximately a "C," which
is about class average.
Unless all three of the remaining games are
an entirely convincing display of Indian spirit,
kept relatively dormant all year—except (hir

both team and student body, the final gun of
the California game will bring to a close the
careers of "the greatest group of football play
ers in Stanford history"—without even giving
them a chance to redeem two Rose Bowl de
bacles.
The Pasadena "light is slill on, but last
week's round hardly goes to Stanford.
With a 14 to 2 victory over U.C.L.A., Cali

"should have won," Stanford rolled toward ,
the Big Game and a Rose Bowl possibility.
