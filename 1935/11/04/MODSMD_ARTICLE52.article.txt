# Football Movies Should Go On—With Organization
## 
### 
Boisterous proof that l(>-iniu. movies of the
football games are appreciated was furnished
by the four hundred odd students who jam
packed the Little Theater Thursday night.
With every seat taken, every aisle sardine
can lull, all window seats full, and not a few
unable to get in at all—there could be little
doubt that students wanted to see those lilms,
and probably others.
Even though the crowd was in a gay mood,
responding vociferously to the pleas for
noise of ex-yell leader Triolo, assistant yell
leader Web Jones, and pseudo-song leader
Bob (Iros, there was no excuse for the half
hour wait before the lilms started.
The poor handling of the showing will
doubtless keep many from returning to fu
ture football game lilms unless somebody
steps in to fill the void and assure better
planned, properly presented showings.
Logical body to take over this activity is
the Cardinals, ollicial A.S.S.U. activities group.
Ex Committee would do well to put the mat
ter inlo that unit's hands. Cardinals could
then arrange several showings per season of
the best games, particularly olf-campus ones.
For the present, it might do well to promise
two runs of each game's films a night if the
crowds justify it, since the Little Theater is
apparently unable to seal all comers for one
run.
