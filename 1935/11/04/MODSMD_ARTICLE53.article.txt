The grim avengers of the Paly police department
are out after these consarned college kids that are
making life miserable for decent and respectable citi
zens in village picture houses with their booing and
caterwauling.
While (he; decent and respectable citizens of Paly
were in the Assembly Hall spying on the Dramatic
Council production "Dark Tower," these young hood
lums from the Farm were down at a local theater
Friday night. .
When the electric power flickered and died, the
cast of the campus show carried on. The dimming of
the lights coincided with a script call for the singing of
"Stormy Weather." Which the nasty casty sang while
the elements got elemental outside.
But down town, the canned music got uncanny when
the juice went out. Two hundred amateur Tarzans
immediately sounded the mating call.
Cat-calls, dog-calls, goat-calls echoed and re
echoed throughout the palace of pleasure. All in a
dither, the manager got up and sarcastically suggested
that if the vandals mast yell, why didn't they get a
yell-leader.
This was immediately done. And some spirited
youth led the house in a magnificent rendition of the
Axe yell, a rendition unsurpassed in the history of
Stanford.
But the Paly chief of police was sitting in the
audience, and he found it more than flesh and blood
could bear. He sent in a riot call to CHQ, and a
squad of policeman, armed to the teeth with billy
clubs, descended on the little shrine of cinematic
beauty.
Faced with the problem of acting and acting quickly,
the coppers located two bulky figures in the back row.
"You're the man!" said the chief, and dragged out two
struggling souls. When they got down to the city jail,
they inspected their booty. And found one genuine
Alpha Sig, and a German gardner from Atherton.
Not knowing what to do next, the police clapped
the two in jail for a couple of hours, finally released
them on $5 bail.
Said the German gardner: "I haff not been in dis
kuntry vary lang."
Bleary-eyed students pounding the books for mid
terms Thursday night had the very core of their souls
grated out at 9:"0, when two Hallowe'en pranksters
short-circuited wires in the chimes. The campus chimes
tolled ofT about two days worth of time in the space
of a half hour, while finger naiU were bitten all over
the campus.
Dear "Jiust Me":
Dear me.
Our Hasher.
