## UP AND DOWN THE HIGHWAY 
### 
The eve was the epilogue of a gridiron victory . . .
the homefire lacked the usual appeal ... so we set
out to follow the Saturday night legions . . . and ihey
led the way ... off campus ... to the local halls of
merriment . . . the "night spots."
* * * #
Down the highway to the south. Up the highway
to the north, the scenes are the same. A dense huddle
of cars around a low-slung center of bright lights,
piano noises, and clinking ice. Inside are many well
worn sofas, overstuffed chairs, and low coffee tables
with circles stained upon them. And there is a
miniature dance floor before a miniature orchestra.
Sitting on the sofas, staining circles on the coffee tables,
and moving on the dance floors are members of the
Saturday night legions. In spite of their laughter most
of them are a disgruntled lot of Harlequins.
* # * *
Why are they there? The answer is a by-word of
youth. There is no place else to go. And why does
this situation exist? The professor in Elementary
Sociology would have an answer for that. A college
is like a modern family. The form is there but the
function is gone. The most attractive interests are
outside the home, so nobody stays home.
* * * *
Nearly every week-end some group on the campus
gives a dance, a ball, or a jolly-up. Hundreds attend —
hundreds of near strangers. The atmosphere is about
as congenial as Friday evening in the reserve book
room. If anyone spends the entire evening at one of
these affairs he is either broke or determined to get his
money's worth. The tradition is to leave sooner or
later and go down the highway to the south or up the
highway to the north.
* V V
After a quarter or two of these excursions, the zest
of the thing is dulled. What was once original adven
ture becomes routine. Planking down three or four
two-bit pieces an evening becomes tiresome. Listening
to the endless piano plunkings becomes irksome. And
trying to be gay where gayness is artificial and often
forced becomes boresoine.

But as long as the campus continues to be made
up of aloof and emulous groups, the night spots will
continue to flourish, and the kind of social activities
which will keep the Saturday night legions on campus
will be impossible. —John McClelland

The eve was the epilogue of a gridiron victory . . .
the homefire lacked the usual appeal ... so we set
out to follow the Saturday night legions . . . and ihey
led the way ... off campus ... to the local halls of
merriment . . . the "night spots."

Down the highway to the south. Up the highway
to the north, the scenes are the same. A dense huddle
of cars around a low-slung center of bright lights,
piano noises, and clinking ice. Inside are many well
worn sofas, overstuffed chairs, and low coffee tables
with circles stained upon them. And there is a
miniature dance floor before a miniature orchestra.
Sitting on the sofas, staining circles on the coffee tables,
and moving on the dance floors are members of the
Saturday night legions. In spite of their laughter most
of them are a disgruntled lot of Harlequins.

Why are they there? The answer is a by-word of
youth. There is no place else to go. And why does
this situation exist? The professor in Elementary
Sociology would have an answer for that. A college
is like a modern family. The form is there but the
function is gone. The most attractive interests are
outside the home, so nobody stays home.

Nearly every week-end some group on the campus
gives a dance, a ball, or a jolly-up. Hundreds attend —
hundreds of near strangers. The atmosphere is about
as congenial as Friday evening in the reserve book
room. If anyone spends the entire evening at one of
these affairs he is either broke or determined to get his
money's worth. The tradition is to leave sooner or
later and go down the highway to the south or up the
highway to the north.

After a quarter or two of these excursions, the zest
of the thing is dulled. What was once original adven
ture becomes routine. Planking down three or four
two-bit pieces an evening becomes tiresome. Listening
to the endless piano plunkings becomes irksome. And
trying to be gay where gayness is artificial and often
forced becomes boresoine.

But as long as the campus continues to be made
up of aloof and emulous groups, the night spots will
continue to flourish, and the kind of social activities
which will keep the Saturday night legions on campus
will be impossible. —John McClelland
