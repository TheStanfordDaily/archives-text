# An Apology Received
## 
### 
Acting as spokesman for the Associated Students, the Stan
ford Daily last Wednesday demanded from Art Cohn, sports
writer of the Long Beach Press-Telegram, an apology and a
printed retraction for a series of unfounded assertions made
in his column of October 22. Cohn had claimed that "it was
not an eye ailment that forced Frank Alustiza to quit fooball
. . . (but) because of 'bad blood' either Grayson or Alustiza
had to go. Bobby was more valuable so he stayed. That's why
Alustiza suddenly became blind."
Cohn's letter of apology is printed below. For the re
quested printed retraction that ran in his column of last Satur
day see the front page of this issue of The Daily.
November 2, 1935
Mr. Bob Jones
Editor. Stanford Daily
Palo Alto. Calit.
Dear Mr. Jones:
Enclosed is a proof of my column to appear in today's Long
Beach Press-Telegram. It requires no comment.
I sincerely regret the incident and trust it's a closed issue.
(Signed) ART COHN
Sports Dept., Long Beach Press-Telegram
