HELENA, Mont., Nov. 3 (/P). —
Heartened by warmer weather, Hel
ena residents attacked vigorously to
day the rehabilitation tasks left by
two furious earthquakes.
Temperatures rose from below
zero to 14 above, and slight tremors
occurred with less frequency.
In the drive to obliterate multiple
scars of the 799 shocks that have been
recorded since October 12, there will
be "no red tape," said James H.
Howe of Butte, representing Frank
Walker of the National Emergency
Council at Washington.
''If anyone is suffering from lack
of shelter, food or clothing or other
necessities, it's because they haven't
made their wants known to the Red
Cross, the FERA or the County Em
ergency Relief Organization," said
Rowe.
