# "IT IS UP TO US"
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
The impression gathered by a
i number of students who took Pro
! fessor Cottrell's mid-quarter ex in
1 Political Science I last Friday was
j that it was proctored. I had that
feeling and it made me realize what
a valuable privilege would be taken
away from us should the Stanford
Honor Code be abandoned. . . .
My first step was to take the mat
| ter up with Professor Cottrell. He
made a complete check of the ques
tion and gave a very fair explana
| tion for the presence of the assist
: ants during the ex. The reason was
: that there was considerable delay
caused by handing out ex questions
to late comers, which was followed
by an unusually long period ex
plaining some of the questions and
with the passing out of syllabus
sheets.
By this time the exes commenced
to be handed in; so that it was
I entirely a coincidence which caused
the assistants to be present through
j out the ex. All this required con-
I siderable walking about; hence the
i feeling that the ex was being
J proctored.
Professor Cottrell then proceeded
j to tell me more about the Honor
Code in ten minutes than I had
learned in a year at Stanford. There
| seem to be a number of angles from
which to look at. it. No one is naive
enough to believe that the Honor
Code is never violated. On the
i other hand a cheater is almost as
likely to cheat under the Keeper
system as the Honor Code. The
j point is that under the Honor Code
1 if a professor finds undeniable evi
dence of cheating when he corrects
1 his papers, it is up to the Student's
Council to do something about it.
Professor Cottrell's stand is this:
i He does not have his exes proc

' tored. He approves of the Honor i
j Code, but he emphasizes the fact |
j that if an Honor Code is to work, the j
j students must be conscientiously for i
i it and that when cases of violation j
l are brought before the i
Council, it is the duty of that organ J
I to handle the matter adequately.
In spite of temporary misgivings ;
; aroused by last Friday's ex, it seems j
that the Honor Code has not been set j
! aside. Furthermore, the faculty ap- j
| pears to be more than ready to do j
their part to preserve itâ€”lt is up !
!to us! Boyd White ,
