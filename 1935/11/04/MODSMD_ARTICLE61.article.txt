1 4 BROADWAY MELODY OF 1936"
At the Stanford Theater
A Not since the first "Broad
way Melody" in 1929 has
MGM condescended to re-
I lease a super-super musical.
I But substantially broken is that
precedent by "Broadway Melody of
1936."
Principal reason for the new "Mel
ody's" smashingness is Eleanor Pow
ell, acclaimed as the foremost woman
tap dancer of the world. Not only ii,
j she actually a female Fred Astaire,
; but her wholesome personality is
I surprisingly striking and her acting
unbelievably unaffected for one
I ballyhooed merely as a dancer. She
; does a top-notch imitation of Kath-
I arine Hepburn in "Morning Glory."
Other high-lights: aided by Sid

Silvers and Una Merkel, Jack Ben
ny's comedy; songs and dances by-
Buddy and Vilma Ebsen; Robert
Wildhack's snoring lessons; Frances
Langford's voice. The picture's only
detraction: Robert Taylor, who is
sort of a simp. —Botsford
