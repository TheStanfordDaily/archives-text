# Professor To Talk Of Oil Over Radio
## 
### 
Speaking tonight at 8 o'clock on
the Stanford Radio Hour from sta
tion KGO, Frederick George Tickell,
professor of petroleum engineering,
will discuss the technical achieve
ments in the petroleum industry.
Although petroleum is being
produced in overabundance, there is
intensive competition by producers
in the search for new supplies. Not
only is a diligent search being made
for free deposits, but extraordinary
technical facilities have been de
veloped for drilling at depths in ex
cess of 12,000 feet, Professor Tickell
explains.
