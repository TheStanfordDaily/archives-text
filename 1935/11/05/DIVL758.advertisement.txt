| ONE WAY ROUND TRIP |
27 trains every weekday and 10 every Sunday! That's the kind of
service Southern Pacific provides between here and San Francisco.
Our trains are fast and frequent. They racc over the smoothest,
safest highway in the world—stee! rails. Cars are spacious, well
lighted and roomy. You can stretch out and read without straining
your eyes. Next time you go to the City, try the train!
53.00 buys a Weekly Pass—good for an unlimited number of
roundtrips during a single? week.
