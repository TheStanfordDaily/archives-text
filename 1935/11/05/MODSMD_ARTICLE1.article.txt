Bringing forth an innovation to
Farm rallies, Coghlan has planned
an authentic "amateur night'' pro
gram and he promises all kinds
of entertainment from tap-dancing
to a trumpet solo. The fire gong
will be on hand.
Head Yell Leader Dick Stark, who
is making the trip south with the
team, is planning a short rally to be
held after the main event, at the
railroad station as the team em
barks.
