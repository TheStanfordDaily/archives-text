# Cottrell Sees Rossi Re-election In San Francisco Polls Today
## 
### 
Describing most of the opposition
as composed of ''politicians of the
cheaper type who want an office,"
Edwin A. Cottrell, political science
professor, last night predicted the
entire Rossi administration would
be returned to office in San Fran
cisco's municipal election today.
"It would he a good guess to say
Mayor Angelo Rossi will have a
majority of 20,000 votes," Profes
sor Cottrell said, "and I think he
will retain control of the Board
of Supervisors."
Nothing can be told about the out
come of the race for sheriff, accord
ing to Cottrell, because opponents
of the present office holder have had
no experience and no one knows
what they want to do.
In the mayoral and supervisorial
campaign, Professor Cottrell believes
the chief opposition to Mayor Rossi
is the slate headed by Supervisor
Adolph Uhl.

"If Uhl loses the mayoral elec
tion, he still will be on the Board
of Supervisors, and if his four can
didates for the Board should win,
he would control that body. How
ever, I think it more than likely
that he will be lucky to elect one
of his men.
"As to the Cincinnatus group, they
have some very fine men seeking
office, but such a party, to defeat the
administration, would need some
thing fundamentally rotten in the
city government to fight. They
haven't been able to find anything
seriously wrong. There is only a
slight chance one of the superviso
rial candidates might slip in."
Mayor Rossi, in Professor Cot
trell's opinion, has given San Fran
cisco a good administration. The
effects of the waterfront strike might
be troublesome for Rossi, but Pro
fessor Cottrell says most of the con
servative labor element will be

strongly for the administration.
"Radical labor will stick to Red
fern Mason for mayor, and that
will help Mr. Rossi, I think," Pro
fessor Cottrell declared. "Mr. Uhl
was counting on the backing of
that part of the labor organization
and its loss was a serious blow."
Regarding the charter amend
ments to put city employees under
civil service, Cottrell pointed out
none of the candidates have voiced
opposition "because there are 8,000
employees with votes," but he be
lieves the amendments will lose ' be
cause the people of San Francisco
are not satisfied about civil service."
Mr. Cottrell thinks civil service
should be adopted "as a policy" and
that political appointees should be
weeded out later.
It is the necessity of blanketing in
the political appointees in the vari
ous departments that will defeat the
amendments, he believes.

cheaper type who want an office,"
Edwin A. Cottrell, political science
professor, last night predicted the
entire Rossi administration would
be returned to office in San Fran
cisco's municipal election today.
"It would he a good guess to say
Mayor Angelo Rossi will have a
majority of 20,000 votes," Profes
sor Cottrell said, "and I think he
will retain control of the Board
of Supervisors."
Nothing can be told about the out
come of the race for sheriff, accord
ing to Cottrell, because opponents
of the present office holder have had
no experience and no one knows
what they want to do.
In the mayoral and supervisorial
campaign, Professor Cottrell believes
the chief opposition to Mayor Rossi
is the slate headed by Supervisor
Adolph Uhl.

"If Uhl loses the mayoral elec
tion, he still will be on the Board
of Supervisors, and if his four can
didates for the Board should win,
he would control that body. How
ever, I think it more than likely
that he will be lucky to elect one
of his men.
"As to the Cincinnatus group, they
have some very fine men seeking
office, but such a party, to defeat the
administration, would need some
thing fundamentally rotten in the
city government to fight. They
haven't been able to find anything
seriously wrong. There is only a
slight chance one of the superviso
rial candidates might slip in."
Mayor Rossi, in Professor Cot
trell's opinion, has given San Fran
cisco a good administration. The
effects of the waterfront strike might
be troublesome for Rossi, but Pro
fessor Cottrell says most of the con
servative labor element will be

strongly for the administration.
"Radical labor will stick to Red
fern Mason for mayor, and that
will help Mr. Rossi, I think," Pro
fessor Cottrell declared. "Mr. Uhl
was counting on the backing of
that part of the labor organization
and its loss was a serious blow."
Regarding the charter amend
ments to put city employees under
civil service, Cottrell pointed out
none of the candidates have voiced
opposition "because there are 8,000
employees with votes," but he be
lieves the amendments will lose ' be
cause the people of San Francisco
are not satisfied about civil service."
Mr. Cottrell thinks civil service
should be adopted "as a policy" and
that political appointees should be
weeded out later.
It is the necessity of blanketing in
the political appointees in the vari
ous departments that will defeat the
amendments, he believes.
