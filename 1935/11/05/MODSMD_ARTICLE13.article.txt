# Storm Debris Aids Bonfire
## 
### 
No harm was caused the Big Game
bonfire by last Friday night's wind
iest. Much of the vegetable debris
that was blown about the campus
has been collected and hauled to
the scene of the pyre.
In addition the upright poles have
arrived and are on the property.
The exact site of the structure has
been set out, coinciding with last
year's fire in order to save digging
new flues.
There will be four corner up
rights, cach 35 feet high and forming
a square 35 feet on a side, one up
right in the middle of each side of
the square, and a narrow tripod near
the center of the structure.
