# Bell-Ringer Absent As Electricity Tolls Chimes
## 
### 
The stillness of the ivy-shackled
I clock tower was suddenly disturbed
by the whirring of a huge paddle
like device that commenced opera
tions at precisely 2:45 o'clock yester
day afternoon.
! As the same mechanism has been
] doing the same work for over 22
i years, practically without mishap,
nothing very startling ordinarily
would be gleaned from these words.
TÂ» the unknowing, the old
fashioned, or the uncaring, how
ever, who are wont to think that a
faithful chinies - ringer stands
watch over the tower, awaits the
quarter hour, stalks up the lad
der to the chimes, and adminis
ters four sound blows to each hell,
a bludgeon in his right hand, and a
j shei ( of music in his left, a new

idea is in store.
The complicated electrical device
that executes these duties would
make one believe that no one else
could be capable of ringing the same
chimes, that come, incidentally,
from a long line of famous bells, and
boast ancestral connections with
London's Westminster chimes.
Originally, the chimes pealed
forth their music from atop the
Memorial Church, hut when the
1906 earthquake sent them tum
bling down, they were moved to
their present location.
At present they seem very con
tent to charm with their musical
scales each quarter hour, and ring
very much out of tune each noon
time in conjunction with the campus
noon whistles.
