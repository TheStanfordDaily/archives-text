There is a definite need for a stu
dent book store and library on the
campus, says President Wally
Brooke. He thinks that Ex Commit
tee may sanction a non-profit con
cern, probably backed by A.S.S.U.
Success of last Thursday's com
bination debate and football picture
showing has strengthened the possi
bility of continuing the program
each week. An A.S.S.U.-sponsored
debate or forum, followed by the
showing of the previous week's foot
ball films may be inaugurated as a
regular feature each Wednesday or
Thursday night.
A final date-granting policy may
be formulated in tonight's meet
ing, Latest criticisms have been
made by jolly-up chairmen, as
Mondays are taken up by house
meetings and Tuesdays by the lec
ture series. Wednesday the wom
en's gym is occupied. This leaves
only Thursday for jolly-ups, and
the entire week would be closed
if the proposed football films are
shown on Thursday.
lho German Club wants to spon
sor a dinner during the closed week
before finals, and has applied for
special permission.
A rehash of B.A.C. student rep
resentation is scheduled. The
group will discuss the time-worn
question of rotating membership.
Should a copy of The Daily be sent
to high schcols? "It would show
Stanford life and make prospective
students familiar with the campus,"
observes Brooke. Ex Committee may
agree.
Election of graduate man on Ex
Committee, to be held in conjunc
tion with the frosh class elections,
will be outlined.
Brooke has been asked to make
the main speech, 45 minutes in
length. at a conference of 250 dele
gates to l;c held in Chico Novem
ber 15. "Wanted: suggestions!"
says Brooke. The subject will be
"Student Association."
A Stanford Speakers' Bureau has
been suggested. The chief merit of
the organization, if sanctioned,
would be centralization, as no main
I organization now exists which is
able to supply speakers for meet
| ings, business clubs, or high schools.

There is a definite need for a stu

campus, says President Wally
Brooke. He thinks that Ex Commit
tee may sanction a non-profit con
cern, probably backed by A.S.S.U.
Success of last Thursday's com
bination debate and football picture
showing has strengthened the possi
bility of continuing the program
each week. An A.S.S.U.-sponsored
debate or forum, followed by the
showing of the previous week's foot

A final date-granting policy may
be formulated in tonight's meet

made by jolly-up chairmen, as
Mondays are taken up by house

says Brooke. The subject will be
"Student Association."
A Stanford Speakers' Bureau has
been suggested. The chief merit of
the organization, if sanctioned,
would be centralization, as no main
I organization now exists which is
able to supply speakers for meet
