HELENA, Mont., Nov. 4 (£>).—
Eai'th-jolted Helena's populace, ner
vous and exhausted, started a new
exodus today as scores of pei'sons
evacuated the earthquake zone to
.the accompaniment of after shocks
and expressions of renewed fear.
Although the tremors following
last week's heavy shakes topnled
only loosened bricks and cornices,
the recurrence struck fear into the
citizenry.
