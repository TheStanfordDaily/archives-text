# Dramatic Council Takes Slight Loss
## 
### 
Although student representation |
at the Dramatic Council production :
of "The Dark Tower" last Friday
night was good, outside attendance â€¢
did not quite come up to expecta- i
tions because of the storm. As a j
result, the Dramatic Council sus- j
tained a slight loss, according to !
Dramatic Manager Rex Hardy.
However, this loss is much less !
than that taken on the first student I
show of last fall quarter, and it is ex- ]
pected that the returns from the
Gaieties will more than cover it. The
exact figures are not obtainable
since bills for the production have
not yet been received.
