Tito Schipa, world-famous opera
; tenor who sings in the first of Stan
! ford's 1935-36 concerts tomorrow
' night was "discovered" by the Bishop
j of Lecce while singing in a church
| festival.
At the age of seven. Schipa made
j his real debut in the boys' chorus
i in "Carmen." A few years later
; he composed a mass so beautiful"
that the bishop ordered it sung in
the cathedral. The tenor was sent
j to a seminary for training in the
! service of the church.
Here the bishop recognizcd the
| quality of his voice and arranged to
j have Tito study under Gerunda, the
j greatest master of bel canto in his
j day. Although Schipa was preparing
! for a life of service in the church, the
I bishop declared that "his voice
] would bless and comfort more peo
ple in the great world than in se
' elusion."
Under Gerunda's rigid training;
Schipa was allowed to sing noth
, ing, but exercised for three years.
After another year devoted to the
study of opera roles and acting,
he made his Italian debut in "Tra
viata."
j A few tickets for his concert to
morrow night are still available at
j the concert series office in the Old
! Union.
