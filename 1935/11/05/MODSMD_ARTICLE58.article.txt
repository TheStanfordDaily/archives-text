j To uninitiated hygiene students
browsing for treatise dope in a large
; file-filled room on the third floor of
I the library, the ordinary looking
1 typewriter sitting on the table was
I no novelty—until someone tried
writing with it. What appeai'ed
when the keys hit the paper was not
: only an unintelligible surprise—it
j was Russian script.
Curious to know just why Stan
ford's library should boast a lius
j sian typewriter, the hygienists for
got about preventive medicine and
learned that the Russian Institute,
important part of the famed Hoo
ver War Library, contains what is
acclaimed the finest and most
; complete collection of documentary
material outside of Russia itself on
Tsarist Russia, the Revolution, and
the present U. 5.5.11.
j The collection contains not only
printed documents but is unique in
possessing personal diaries, hand
written memoranda, and notebooks
| of persons active in various parts of
l Russia during the troubled years of
the World War and the Revolution.
' Since its founding in 1919, the Hoo
ver War Library has gathered from
! all parts of the world valuable docu
i ments, memoirs, rare books, maps,
j contemporary newspapers, mag
; azines, and posters which pertain to
Russia, its government, its Revolu
l tion, and other aspects of its culture.
From the beginning, the Insti
i tute's staff, headed by Professor
1 Harold Henry Fisher, contacted

in Russia to lay the foundation of
the Russian collection. Similar
