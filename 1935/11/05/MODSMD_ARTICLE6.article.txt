BUCHAREST, Rumania, Nov. 4
(/P). â€”Former Queen Elizabeth of
Greece has indicated she is not in
terested in returning to the Greek
throne, despite the sweeping victory
of Monarchists in yesterday's Greek
plebiscite.
Divorced from George 11, who is
expected to be restored to the throne
as the result of the nationwide vot
ing, she apparently has no regrets
and prefers to remain a farmerette
in Rumania instead of again becom
ing Queen of Greece.
