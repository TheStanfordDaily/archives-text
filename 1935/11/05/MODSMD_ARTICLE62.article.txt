# Tickell Tells Progress Of Oil Industry
## Radio Speaker Describes Competition as Cause Of Rapid Advance 
### 
Competitive conditions in the ex
| ploitation of this nation's petroleum
reserves have resulted in rapid ad
vances in the art of finding, produc
: ing, and refining petroleum, said
Frederick G. Tickell, professor of
petroleum engineering, in a talk on
the Stanford Radio Hour last night.
The chief reasons for the rapid
progress in petroleum technology,
he explained, are: its widespread
occurrence in this country, the
mobility of the product, a large
and increasing demand, and a
constant revision of the specifica
tions for petroleum products.
Previous to 1908 the finding of pc
! troieum was in unscientific hands,

said Tickell, but in the interval be
tween 1908 and 1915 every company
increased employment of a geologi
cal staff, who mapped and examined
possible productive lands.
Although geologists and gco
physicists have been able to de
termine the lands which may be
oil bearing, the actual discovery
of oil must be made by the drill,
and in many cases the oil is too
deep to be reached by tlu> drilling
machinery in its present state.
Only part of the oil is in a natural
reservoir; certainly not more than
half can be extracted by present
known methods, Tickell concluded.
