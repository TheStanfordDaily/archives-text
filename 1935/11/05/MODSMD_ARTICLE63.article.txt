# Papooses Drill for Bear Frosh
## Card Babes Must Pierce Strong Line Yearlings To Scrimmage, Smooth Pass Defense In Session Today 
### Roger Kimball 
Entering the home stretch before
the all-important Little Big Came
Saturday in the Stadium, the Stan
ford frosh gridmen engaged in sig
nal drill yesterday. Scrimmage
starts today, and will continue to
morrow and Thursday, with the
yearling eleven tapering off with a
light workout or resting Friday.
The Bear Cubs took the measure
of U.S.C.'s frosh Saturday by a mar
gin of 13 to (j to complete an unde
feated preliminary season. Includ
ing the Trojan game, they have
scored 102 points to 19 for their five
opponents. Intex-cepted passes and
blocked kicks, converted into scores,
have helped them win more than
once in the closing minutes.
Cal Frosh 'Lucky'
California's frosh have been called
lucky, but their fine record has
been achieved by playing heads-up
ball turning the breaks to their ad
vantage. Vic Bottari, versatile left
half, is one of their stars, and will
oppose Wally deWitt of the Card
babes as Little Big Game captain.
Bottari's passing and the line plung
ing of Lute Ades, Cub fullback, are
hard to stop.
With a line averaging less than
180 pounds, the Blue and Gold de
fense is still hard to pierce. The
Trojan frosh forward wall out
weighed the Bear Cubs 20 pounds
to the man, but couldn't even
threaten to score on a sustained
march. Their only touchdown re
sulted from a blocked kick.
Come Hjom Behind
Another strong point about Clint
Evans' first-year men over at Berke
ley is the way they play their best
ball when on the short end of the
score. U.S.C. scored first Saturday,
but the Californians took the Tro
jan touchdown as a signal to get two
of their own.
Comparative scores, which mean
even less to frosh teams than to
varsities, favor the Bears, since
Jimmy Bradshaw's Papooses lost to
the Trobabes, 19 to 7. That defeat,
the only one on the Stanford frosh
record, can be blamed on weak pass
defense. No team has gained con
sistently through the Card year
lings' line this season.
In spite of their easy 22-0 victory
over the San Jose State frosh
Saturday, Bradshaw's team again
looked spotty against passes. Sev
eral times the Spartans made big
gains through the air, and once they
almost scored. Since Vic Bottari of
California is a dangerous passer, the
Stanford frosh will probably con
centrate on defense against a good
aerial attack in scrimmage today.

light workout or resting Friday.
The Bear Cubs took the measure
of U.S.C.'s frosh Saturday by a mar
gin of 13 to (j to complete an unde
feated preliminary season. Includ
ing the Trojan game, they have
scored 102 points to 19 for their five
opponents. Intex-cepted passes and
blocked kicks, converted into scores,
have helped them win more than
once in the closing minutes.
Cal Frosh 'Lucky'
California's frosh have been called
lucky, but their fine record has
been achieved by playing heads-up
ball turning the breaks to their ad
vantage. Vic Bottari, versatile left
half, is one of their stars, and will
oppose Wally deWitt of the Card
babes as Little Big Game captain.
Bottari's passing and the line plung
ing of Lute Ades, Cub fullback, are
hard to stop.
With a line averaging less than
180 pounds, the Blue and Gold de
fense is still hard to pierce. The
Trojan frosh forward wall out
weighed the Bear Cubs 20 pounds
to the man, but couldn't even
threaten to score on a sustained
march. Their only touchdown re
sulted from a blocked kick.
Come Hjom Behind
Another strong point about Clint
Evans' first-year men over at Berke
ley is the way they play their best
ball when on the short end of the
score. U.S.C. scored first Saturday,
but the Californians took the Tro
jan touchdown as a signal to get two
of their own.
Comparative scores, which mean
even less to frosh teams than to
varsities, favor the Bears, since
Jimmy Bradshaw's Papooses lost to
the Trobabes, 19 to 7. That defeat,
the only one on the Stanford frosh
record, can be blamed on weak pass
defense. No team has gained con
sistently through the Card year
lings' line this season.
In spite of their easy 22-0 victory
over the San Jose State frosh
Saturday, Bradshaw's team again
looked spotty against passes. Sev
eral times the Spartans made big
gains through the air, and once they
almost scored. Since Vic Bottari of
California is a dangerous passer, the
Stanford frosh will probably con
centrate on defense against a good
aerial attack in scrimmage today.
Entering the home stretch before
the all-important Little Big Came
Saturday in the Stadium, the Stan
ford frosh gridmen engaged in sig
nal drill yesterday. Scrimmage
starts today, and will continue to
morrow and Thursday, with the
yearling eleven tapering off with a
light workout or resting Friday.
