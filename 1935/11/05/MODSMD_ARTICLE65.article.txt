nology students fussy about the
desires, habits, size, and complexion
of their "dates" will have an easier
time from today on.
About 200 girls attending a dance
of the Tech Menorah Society last
night were asked to record specific
data for the society's new "dating
bureau." To the question "Do you
drink?" 30 per cent replied "yes,"
35 per cent "no," and the remainder
indicated they imbibed occasionally.
