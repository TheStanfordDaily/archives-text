# Indian Tankmen Face Uclans, U.S.C. in L.A. This Week-End
## 
### 
Having already added the 1935 Pa
cific Association A.A.U. water polo
championship to Stanford's collection
of athletic titles, Coach Nort Thorn
ton's varsity tankmen will travel to
Los Angeles this week-end where
they are to face U.C.L.A. Friday and
U.S.C. Saturday.
A 4-3 Bruin victory over Cali
fornia last week leaves the Indians
still very much in the running for
the Pacific Coast Conference
crown, since the Uclan outfit is
the league's only undefeated squad.
Stanford and California, with one
loss apiece, are tied for second place,
while U.S.C. holds down the cellar
position. A victory over the Bruins

Friday will give the Cardinals a
chance for the lead in the race.
This afternoon Thornton will re
peat the heavy practice session that
he put the Farm swimmers through
yesterday, but their final workout to
morrow should be light. No practice
is scheduled for Thursday afternoon.
Co-captains Bill Woodard and
Wally Wiget, Bill Clemo, Bob Hoo
ver, "Suds" Sutherland, Chuck
Giffin, Don Peterson, Bob Has
lacher, Ben Voss, Manager Jim
Cayton, and Coach Thornton will
entrain Thursday evening, arriv
ing in the southern city Friday
; morning. The broken eardrum that
I has kept Woodard out of the tank

I since the California battle has
now fully healed and the Stanford
ace will start at his regular for
ward post in both tilts.
While the water poloists have
been hard at work, Henry Godman,
Bill Lharnon, and Larry Pringle, In
dian sprint stars, have by no means
I been idle. It was Godman and Lha
i inon who pressed Pringle so closely
j when he set a new American 50-
meter swimming record of 26.5 sec
| onds several weeks ago, and now the
trio has been dangerously threat
| ening both the 60- and 80-yard na
tional marks. It is probable, however,
that Pringle will not return to the
, Farm next, quarter.
