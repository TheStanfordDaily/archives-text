# Mustangs Seek Rose Bowl Bid
## Coach Fears Hard Going In Remaining Games 
### 
DALLAS, Nov. 4 (JP). — Genial
Madison (Matty) Bell, head man of
Southern Methodist's renowned ae
rial circus, let it slip today his "wild
hosses" will be gunning for Rose
Bowl recognition in the stretch drive
of their rocky schedule.
"Sure we'll be trying for a Rose
Bowl bid," snapped Bell, a rem
nant of the famous "Praying Col
onels" of Centre College and now
in bis first year as bead coach at
Southern Methodist.
But Bell, who has brought perhaps
the greatest cf all Mustang teams
through seven games without a dent,
cast a gloomy look at the five re
maining games on his schedule and
predicted evil things for his air
tricksters.
"Just lcok at those five games—
U.C.L.A., University of Arkansas,
Baylor, Texas Christian, and Texas
A. and M. Any one of them could
beat us, but we will shoot the
works in every game. Maybe we
can win them all. but I don't think
so."
To date his Mustangs have scored
196 points against the enemy's 12.
Rice Institute Owls and University
of Texas failed to scratch against the
potent Methodist line. Washington
University scored a touchdown in the
35-6 licking they took and Hardin-
Simmons, a bruising small Texas
college, also counted against the
Methodists. Substitutes peppered
the Mustang wall, however.
"It looks like Notre Dame just
filed a claim on the Rose Bowl by
beating Ohio State," commented
Bell, "but we'll be trying."
