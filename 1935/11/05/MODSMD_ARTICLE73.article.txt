# Novice Boxers Sign for Meet
## 
### 
With the opening of the novice
I boxing tournament only a week
j away, entries in some of the weight
i divisions are still scarce, although 35
j fight enthusiasts have signed up for
the Circle "S"-sponsored affair, ac
cording to Myron Schall, coach.
The lightest and heaviest classcs
| seem to be drawing fewer entries.
No men have registered in the US
pound division, two are in the 126,
and only one has signed as heavy
weight. Distribution in other
weights is as follows: 135-pound,
j 6 men: 117, 5: 155, 8; 165. 7; 175, 6.
Coach Schail urges all students
who have never gained a boxing let
i ter or held a previous novice tour-
I nament championship to sign up this
) week on the boxing room bulletin
| board in Encina Gym. He especially
wishes to bring the affair to the at
; tention of any boxing-minded mem
! bers of the Japanese Club, which is
one of the few sources of men small
enough to qualify for the lighter
| weight divisions.
