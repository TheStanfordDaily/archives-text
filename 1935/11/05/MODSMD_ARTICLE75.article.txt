# Bruins' Star In Identity Mix-up
## Ted Key Accused of Using Brother's Name 
### 
Ted Key, star fullback on the
U.C.L.A. Bruins football eleven, was
kept out of the University Â«of Cali
; fornia game last Saturday by Dean
! Earl J. Miller. Key was accused of
I being his brother, Clois Francis Key,
[ and of assuming his brother's name,
which was supposed to be Ted Key,
;as well as claiming the brother's
| scholastic credentials.
Dean Miller left yesterday for
Amarillo, Texas, to clear up the
i questioned identity of one of the Key
: brothers, whichever he may be. The
: rumor originated from the fact that
! Clois Key had played football in a

high school in Amarillo, and it ru
mored that Ted is the one.
In contradiction to this belief,
Peter Barber, who seems to have
seen Clois play, remarked, "Clois
was a little man, and Ted is a big'
fellow."
Key's family deny that, there is
any truth in the rumor. Ted, himself,
was broken hearted when he heard
of Dean Miller's action: "It was the
most, unfair experience of my life,
and hbw am I to prove that I really
am myself?"
