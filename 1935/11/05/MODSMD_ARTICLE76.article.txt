# Gate Receipts Increased At Grid Contests
## Nation-wide Improvement Reported by Colleges 
### 
Midseason in 1935 football reveals
a large increase in attendance at
college grid games over that of last
year in a statistical survey made
October 28.
At Stanford the figures, although
still indefinite, show a slight in
crease over the number of fans
counted by the U.A.C. in 1934.
Forty-two colleges reported to the
poll taken in October and 23 of
them claimed gate receipts larger
than in 11)34. Eight attested to an
equal number of spectators, while
only five reported a decrease in the
half-season attendance record.
College publicity men, athletic
directors, and heads of the respec
tive football aggregations assert
the increase is largely due to bet
tered financial conditions in the
United States and to improvement
in the matching of grid teams.
The excitement of Stanford's con
ference chances in the Washington
game accounted for a favorable in
crease in attendance over that of the
Stanford-Washington game played in
Seattle two years ago, but bad
weather at the Santa Clara game
here caused a noticeable decrease
in the turnstile turns, according to
B.A.C. officials.
The University of California at
Los Angeles recorded a 30 per cent
profit above last year; Loyola noted a
25 per cent gain in profits; and al
though Southern California has a
comparatively weak team this year
it recorded an attendance increase
also. The University of California
register shows that the Bear crowds
remain the same.
