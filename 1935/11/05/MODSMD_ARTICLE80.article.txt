## Thornhill Prepares Squad For Trojans As Injured Recover Team Drills Under Lights As Bobby Grayson Fails To Report 
### Herb Diamond 
With a light scrimmage session
under the arc lights last night, Coach
Tiny Thornhill fired the opt ning gun
in this week's gridiron activities pre
paratory to the march on Troy set
for Saturday.
Much of the workout was de
voted to the polishing up of Tiny's
ateist offensive innovation—a new
feature that he hopes will
strengthen the Indian attack con
siderably.
Substituting for Bobby Grayson,
the only member of the current
quartet of cripples who didn't turn
out yesterday, was big Kay Todd at
the fullback post. It was Todd who
came through in last Saturday's
tussle wilh the Broncos when he
tossed a pass to Jimmy Coffis near
the Santa Clara 3-yard marker in
the closing minutes of the first half
and thus paved the way for the tying
touchdown which came but a few
moments later. And it was the same
dependable Todd who was the nu
cleus of most of the offensive pro
ceedings yesterday.
Larry Rouble. Porky Cuneo, and
even Bones Hamilton—whose re
cent injuries have been no little
worry to Thornhill—were all out
limbering up their knee, ankle, and
leg muscles, respectively. Rouble
and Cuneo took a light workout
on the line, while Hamilton, clad
in a sweat suit, did nothing more
than gambol around the field once
or twice.
Hamilton will take it easy for a
while, as his pulled muscle is in
anything but top - notch condition.
Rest, advises Dr. Fritz Roth, team
physician, is the only cure, so Stan
ford may be playing Montana almost
two weeks hence before Bones will
see any action.
Grayson, whose injured lej
forced him to return to his hospital
bed over the week-end. was re
ported im> and around yesterday
and, in all probability, will be back
at work this afternoon.
Forward and lateral passes were
tossed a-plenty, and a series of in
tricate running plays came in for a
lot ol attention too. Coffis and Bill
Paulman, sophomore backs, and Joe
Vigna were doing their share in both
carrying and passing the pigskin.
Yesterday's workout was indica
tive of the fact that Thornhill cer
tainly meant to put into action
what lit* said when he declared
"we've got plenty of work to do
yet'' after the Bronco tilt last Sat
urday. For in the Cardinals' reper
toire of offensive formations very
little was overlooked yesterday.
Prospects for the Trojan battle
this week seem to have taken on a
slightly rosy hue since mentor How
ard Jones of U.S.C. expressed the
hope that his squad might improve
enough this week to stave off any
thing more than a two-touchdown
margin the Indians might pile up.
But Tiny, however, is on the con
stant guard against the slightest in
dication of overconfidence on the
part of the Farm eleven.
It will be a determined band of
Indian warriors that will pit them
selves against the Trojan cohorts,
if he has anything to say about it.
Overconfidence won't be a barri
cade in the Big Red Toboggan's
path; it isn't going to upset the
toboggan's trip Saturday.
If Grayson's leg recovers suffi
ciently, and it is almost certain that
it will, the same lineup that tri
umphed over the Broncos will start
against the Trojans. Thomhill will
not use cither Hamilton or Rouble
Saturday if ho can get by safely
without them.
And by the end of this week, with
increasingly heavy workouts, the
.•-quad should bo fortified against
any and all U.S.C. threats, and he
won't need Bones or Larry.

Yesterday's workout was indica
tive of the fact that Thornhill cer
tainly meant to put into action
what lit* said when he declared
"we've got plenty of work to do
yet'' after the Bronco tilt last Sat
urday. For in the Cardinals' reper
toire of offensive formations very
little was overlooked yesterday.
Prospects for the Trojan battle
this week seem to have taken on a
slightly rosy hue since mentor How
ard Jones of U.S.C. expressed the
hope that his squad might improve
enough this week to stave off any
thing more than a two-touchdown
margin the Indians might pile up.
But Tiny, however, is on the con
stant guard against the slightest in
dication of overconfidence on the
part of the Farm eleven.
It will be a determined band of
Indian warriors that will pit them
selves against the Trojan cohorts,
if he has anything to say about it.
Overconfidence won't be a barri
cade in the Big Red Toboggan's
path; it isn't going to upset the
toboggan's trip Saturday.
If Grayson's leg recovers suffi
ciently, and it is almost certain that
it will, the same lineup that tri
umphed over the Broncos will start
against the Trojans. Thomhill will
not use cither Hamilton or Rouble
Saturday if ho can get by safely
without them.
And by the end of this week, with
increasingly heavy workouts, the
.•-quad should bo fortified against
any and all U.S.C. threats, and he
won't need Bones or Larry.
With a light scrimmage session
under the arc lights last night, Coach
Tiny Thornhill fired the opt ning gun
in this week's gridiron activities pre
paratory to the march on Troy set
for Saturday.
Much of the workout was de
voted to the polishing up of Tiny's
ateist offensive innovation—a new
feature that he hopes will
strengthen the Indian attack con
siderably.
Substituting for Bobby Grayson,
the only member of the current
quartet of cripples who didn't turn
out yesterday, was big Kay Todd at
the fullback post. It was Todd who
came through in last Saturday's
tussle wilh the Broncos when he
tossed a pass to Jimmy Coffis near
the Santa Clara 3-yard marker in
the closing minutes of the first half
and thus paved the way for the tying
touchdown which came but a few
moments later. And it was the same
dependable Todd who was the nu
cleus of most of the offensive pro
ceedings yesterday.
Larry Rouble. Porky Cuneo, and
even Bones Hamilton—whose re
cent injuries have been no little
worry to Thornhill—were all out
limbering up their knee, ankle, and
leg muscles, respectively. Rouble
and Cuneo took a light workout
on the line, while Hamilton, clad
in a sweat suit, did nothing more
than gambol around the field once
or twice.
Hamilton will take it easy for a
while, as his pulled muscle is in
anything but top - notch condition.
Rest, advises Dr. Fritz Roth, team
physician, is the only cure, so Stan
ford may be playing Montana almost
two weeks hence before Bones will
see any action.
Grayson, whose injured lej
forced him to return to his hospital
bed over the week-end. was re
ported im> and around yesterday
and, in all probability, will be back
at work this afternoon.
Forward and lateral passes were
tossed a-plenty, and a series of in
tricate running plays came in for a
lot ol attention too. Coffis and Bill
Paulman, sophomore backs, and Joe
Vigna were doing their share in both
carrying and passing the pigskin.
