"STANFOD CAN'T
LICK CAL"—MORSE
"Unless Stanford improves might
ily during the next three weeks and
California slips back decidedly, there
can be only one outcome to the Big
Game.
'"As Stanford played on Satur
day the Indians could not lick one
side of the Golden Bear."
I rom the pen of Brick Morse,
San Francisco sports columnist, who ;
saw both Stanford and California de
feat Santa Clara, comcs that state
ment. And despite the fact that
Brick is always prejudiced toward
the Bears, it comes mighty close to
the point.
Stanford has been in a tough spoi |
all this season. Psychologically the I
Indians have had tougher odds io
fight than any team on the coast.
I For two years now Stanford has had
its share of glory and praise. For
two years it has been on the top.
And to expect a team that has
twice made the climb to confer
j encc and Rose Bowl honors suc
cessfully, to have the same driv
ing desire to reach those goals a
third time is psychologically un
sound. Certainly, when a squad
has tasted so much of victory as
has Stanford, the craving for it
lessens.
I This piece is not meant as a criti
; cism of the whole or any part of
Stanford's football team; merely a
statement of what appears to be
j obvious fact. The players them
j selves may not even be conscious
' of it.
"OLD MAN LETDOWN''
—HE'S THE CULPRIT
It cannot be called overconfidence,
It cannot be called disinterest.
Rather it is a natural letdown after
two seasons of success.
Once this season Stanford over
rode that letdown spirit and again
rose to the heights—winning a
football game became the most im
portant thing of the hour. That
was at Washington two weeks ago.
And that was because Stanford's
student body wanted victory des
perately.
Last Saturday the letdown struck j
again. Half the game was gone be- |
tore the Indians freed themselves of ]
its hold. Then, and only then, did
Stanford really play football as Stan- J
ford should. The Indian squeezed
through again. Old Man Letdown
didn't completely ruin the Cardinal
season.
But now that is past and Stanford |
is still down. And that is why Brick I
Morse can say so emphatically that 1
the Indian won't even scare the Bear J
or. Big Game Day.
Mr. Morse, however, did not see ;
Stanford play at Washington. This
Sidelincr. through good fortune,
did. And may I say. Brick, that if j
Stanford's men have spirit equal j
to that which they showed up
thar in the Northwest, California, j
or anyone else will have one devil
of a time beating them.
For four days I lived with the j
team; watched them rise from ordi- j
nary desire for victory to a point |
where a win meant more than any- I
thing else. Then after the ball game I
they slipped back. It was natural.
STANFORD CAN
LICK CAL. IF
STANFORD CAN CRUSH EVERY i
ONE OF ITS THREE REMAINING
OPPONENTS THIS SEASON, IN
CLUDING CAL. IF— Yes, there's j
and "if" to it. But an "if" that can '
easily be cleared of its indefinite- i
ness. IF STANFORD CAN SHAKE !
THE LETDOWN.
And the job of getting rid of ;
that element falls to Stanford stu- j
dents. They were the ones who I
really won at Washington. They j

staged a rally that set determina
tion in the hearts of those players.
They can do it again. Before the
U.S.C. game, and Montana and then
with the great climax —Cal. But it
will take yelling, and spirited talk
ing, and sweeping away of the let
down that's smothering Stanford.
Go ahead, call this a silly high
school pep talk. Condemn it for
being over-enthusiastic. Yes, you'll
be right, it is.
But if Stanford would have its
team more than half lick the Bear,
and Montana Grizzly, and LT.S.C.
Trojan, then .silly, over-enthusiastic
student spirit is the solution.

again. Half the game was gone be- |
tore the Indians freed themselves of ]
its hold. Then, and only then, did
Stanford really play football as Stan- J
ford should. The Indian squeezed
through again. Old Man Letdown
didn't completely ruin the Cardinal
season.
But now that is past and Stanford |
is still down. And that is why Brick I
Morse can say so emphatically that 1
the Indian won't even scare the Bear J
or. Big Game Day.
Mr. Morse, however, did not see ;
Stanford play at Washington. This
Sidelincr. through good fortune,
did. And may I say. Brick, that if j
Stanford's men have spirit equal j
to that which they showed up
thar in the Northwest, California, j
or anyone else will have one devil
of a time beating them.
For four days I lived with the j
team; watched them rise from ordi- j
nary desire for victory to a point |
where a win meant more than any- I
thing else. Then after the ball game I
they slipped back. It was natural.

THE LETDOWN.

that element falls to Stanford stu- j

really won at Washington. They j

staged a rally that set determina

school pep talk. Condemn it for
being over-enthusiastic. Yes, you'll
be right, it is.
But if Stanford would have its
team more than half lick the Bear,
and Montana Grizzly, and LT.S.C.
Trojan, then .silly, over-enthusiastic
student spirit is the solution.
