# Soccer Team Drills For Bulldog Contest
## 
### 
In a determined effort to break
into the "win" column, the Stanford
soccer team is practicing extensively
for its game with San Mateo J.C. on
the latter's field Thursday after
noon.
It was no disgrace for the In
dians to lose to S.F.U. last Satur
day as they are undoubtedly the
strongest team in the conference
if not. on the whole Pacific Coast.
That game proved one thing for
the losers—that their experiment
of strengthening offense at the cost
of the defense is a had policy.
The day before the contest with
the Dons, Coach Dick Bullis decided
to break up the heretofore impreg
nable defense and move Hall and
Sloan up to the forv/ard line in an
effort to strengthen that department.
However, the scheme did not work
out as well as expected and Bullis

. has decided to go back to the old
line-up for Thursday's game.
In the first meeting of the two
teams, the junior college boys
handed the Cards a 2-0 beating.
However, this was Stanford's first
game of the season and they show- 1
ed a lot of weakness that can be
attributed to that, all of which goes
to say that the team which takes
the field against San Mateo this
week will be a lot better than it
was at the first game.
In practice yesterday, Bullis
substituted freely in an effort to find
a smooth working eleven. In spite
of this, they had difficulty scoring
against the frosh and looked rather
poor. However, Bullis expects them
to be back in form by game time
and break the long row of defeats.
