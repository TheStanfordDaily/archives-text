# Polo Men Will Vie For Posts On First Team
## Invitation from Pasadena Increases Interest 
### 
Tomorrow afternoon's intrasquad
polo contest between picked teams
of the Stanford A squad promises
to he a thriller as players with any
chance of being included on the
lour-man first outfit or picked as
alternate begin to take on life in the
battle to be among the chosen few.
This sudden activity among the
Indian polo men is due to the in
vitation extended the Card squad
to participate in the Midwick Jun
ior Polo Tournament at Pasadena
during the Christinas holidays, and
to the fact that the'first string
choices are still not permanent,
number one position being an es
pecially wide-open affair.
At the present time the regulars
consist of Cari Beal, "Rammy" Ras
mussen, and Bob Fullerton at posi
tions two, three, and four respec
tively, while the two most likely
candidates for the number one post
are Warren Derby and Don Mc-
Ausland. Other men with good
chances to break into the lineup are
Voorhies, Dwyer, J. Fullerton, Cof
fin, and McKeon.
Probable lineups for tomorrow's
will be played on the
highway field at 3 o'clock, are: Reds
—Derby, Beal, Rasmussen, B. Ful
lerton; Whites — McAusland or
Voorhies, Dwyer or J. Fullerton,
Coffin, McKeon.
