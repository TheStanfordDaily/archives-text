## Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily Member of the Associated Press New Theater By Itself Cannot Rectify Dramatic Council's Present Difficulty 
### 
The sparse attendance of less than 700 at
Friday's Dramatic Council presentation of
"The Dark Tower" raises two questions
how well dramatics are handled on the cam
pus, and how permanent an effect the opening
of the new theater will have on student in
terest .
For several years, the 15ig (lame Gaieties
has been the only performance on the Dra
matic Council's schedule that can draw a
crowd big enough to pay expenses. The Gaie
ties lately have been counted on annually to
support dramatics at Stanford.
The ancient Assembly Hall, of course, has
little romantic allure that would encourage
the Farm Hough to bring "the one and only"
to a local talent play on a Friday evening,
when he could just as well go dancing in Sail
Francisco. War Memorial Hall, at least for
the lirst few plays, will have the required
lure, Mil when the novellv wears oil', the

dramatic situation may become as bad as it
is under the present set-up. A new theater
alone will not change the habits of 3800 Stan- [
ford students.
"The Dark Tower" had a good plot and was :
well producedâ€”yet il drew less than 7(10
people, including both students and outsiders. !
Nearly every play at the University of Cali- i
l'ornia is presented to a 1,200-house on two I
successive evenings, a difference much greater i
than the relative size of the two student bod- !
ics would account for.
This would indicate that there is a prob- ;
lein of management the Dramatic Council !
should face without evasion. II the advance j
publicity is at fault, it is the Council's duty j
lo formulate an organized publicity program
that will give the plays il selects a greater j
student appeal. The Council has already been [
impressed with the fact that Stanford dra- :
matics face oblivion unless lethargic campus i
interest is revived.
