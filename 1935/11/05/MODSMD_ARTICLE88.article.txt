# Smashing 44 Years of Respect For One Hour of Nervousness
## 
### 
Bothersome mid-term examinations again
bring out tiie apparent indilTerenee to one of
Mrs. Slanl'ord's wishes lliat there he no
smoking on the Quad. This Stanford tradi
tion places a taboo on smoking in the c lass
rooms or under the arches of the arcades
surrounding the Quad.
Disregard on I lie part of Stanford men and
women in recent years has led to the breaking
of numerous traditions that were once sacred
to the now disappearing Rough. This lack of
spirit is now leading to the possible breaking
of the smoking custom, and at the same time
is proving offensive to the non-smokers, and
a lire threat to the administration. Because
the Quad rooms are rather old, one cigarette
butt could do the University irreparable dam
age.
If students gel nervous during an examina
tion and feel they need a drag, the honor code
gives Ilier.i the privilege of leaving the room
and walking out into the street where they
are free to smoke.
It becomes a question whether a few stu
dents in the various classes must smoke dur
ing an ex taken in the Quad and in turn smash
all the tradition and respect that has been
built up in the University for the last forty
four years or whether an aroused student
body will crush such violations.
Stanford traditions have been tottering on
their last legs, and unless definite action is
taken by the student body to maintain an air
of respect on the Farm, Old Man Tradition
will lake his place down in the museum along
with the other relies.
