Roscndahl, an authority on airships, declared
in a recent statement asking for the wider use
of such craft in the commercial field.
Commander Roscndahl emphasized the
relative safety of air travel with the remark
"no other form of transport in the history of
the world has had such a record."
This is but one of the indications pointing
to the increase in air travel both within and
between countries. Considering this, it seems
unusual that Stanford, generally among the
leading universities in facilitating new trends,
has not already established a school of avia
tion.
Stanford students already have shown
themselves to be among the most air-minded
in the country. Last year (>2 students totaled
1400 hours of Hying lime at an aviation
school in Palo Alto. The Farm is well adapted
to aviation, since il oilers plenty of living
room and countless opportunities for surveil
lance of experiments constantly being con
ducted at nearby Ray airports.
With elaborate equipment and adequate
laboratories for study in nearly every field of
science, it seems a bit inconsistent that Stan
ford is not keeping apace in this coming field
of transportation.
