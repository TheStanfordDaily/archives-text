Some days ago an innocent freshman asked the
chairman of Men's Council, a certain Robert Gros by
name, if President Wilbur had a horsewhip in his
office. "Of course not," the Men's Councilor explained
in a lengthy fashion, pointing to the adult, liberal
nature of the Harvard of the West.
During a dinner at the president's home a few
days later Gros told Dr. Wilbur the funny story.
The reply was: "I don't wish to make a liar of you.
Gros, but I do Wtive a horsewhip in my office."
Not only does the president have a horsewhip in
his office, but he has a young arsenal of pistoLs, which
he has collected and has stored on six large shelves.
The horsewhip, however, is not a real one, but only
the picture of a friend of his—in short, a photograph.
The method of procedure of the S.F. traffic squad is
truly remarkable. The City cops have levied toll on
many a dern fool college kid from Stanford, but ihey
recently knocked down no less a person than the presi
dent of the college himself.
It .seems that Dr. Wilbur's car was proceeding with
due caution and circumspection through a school zone
in the City by the Golden Gate. When behind the car
was heard the pleading, plaintive wail of a sour
stomached siren.
The car pulled over It) the curb. The cop parked his
bike, and leered at the occupants of the Buick. Didn't
you .see that this was a school zone?"
"Yes," said Dr. Wilbur.
"How fast do you think you were going?"
"Fifteen to sixteen miles per hour," calmly replied
the president.
This rather stopped the cop for a minute, but it
didn't stop him for long. Great are the resources of
these little angels of mercy.
Said the officer: "Well, I've a good notion to pinch
you, but we're having a policeman's ball. Here are
a couple of tickets for a buck apiece."
The president bought them.
Stopped over the week-end by a policeman, but
with a good deal more justification, was Our Hasher in
person, who mistook the city limits of Livermore for
the great San Joaquin prairie.
"Forty-eight in a 20-mile zone," said the officer.
"Where is Aiax Baer, now? ' asked Our Hasher.
"Oh. h<-'s up in Sacramento. Say. you know he was
in town for a big banquet a while ago, and they had
a sign up on the theater—'Louis-Baer fight pictures.'
And you know, he looked up at that sign, and he said
to me, he said: 'Where have I seen that before?' "
Our Hasher laughed.
"Well, don't let it happen again," said the cop,
Our Hasher lauthed and didn't let it happen again.
When the Livermore police department holds its an
imal policeman's ball, Max Baer may be there, but
Our 11., ,'.ht won't.
