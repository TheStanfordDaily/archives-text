## "CRAZY COLLEGE KIDS" 
### 
It's great to be on the Bayshore headed for a
smooth floor, a smooth band, and a smooth drink.
You're all decked out in black and white, and between
nonchalant flips at the wheel you're going through
the pleasant agony of making conversation with the
girl friend.
The lights ahead flash up evenly from pin-points
to big refracting blobs. Then suddenly the pattern
gets out of line. Instinctively you know something is
wrong and your foot flashes frpm the accelerator to
the brake.
Tires squeal. The girl friend gasp.s. The car
swerves like a three-sheet drunk, and you stop a bare
six inches from an ancient mechanical bucking-bronco
that has crossed your traffic lane. Inside is a puffing
old gent, holding the wheel in a death grip, trembling
at the gills with fear that is condensing into rage.
He may open the window and burn your cars off
He may just glare as he fumbles around searching fol
low gear. But it's a cinch he'll mutter that inevitable
and soul-comforting epithet of oldsters, "Crazy Col
lege Kids."
* * * *
Crazy or not, the "college kid" who nearly ran the
old gent down didn't dent either fender or driver. It's
a certainty, however, that the venerable buggy-whip
per was convinced that it was his own cleverness that
avoided a fatal accident, that the "crazy kid'' was
going faster than he should.
It's equally certain, moreover, that ihe old gent did
not credit the "kid's" incredibly rapid reaction time in
slamming on ihe brakes; that he didn't think and has
never thought of the nice balance between physio
logical fitness and the avoidance of accidents.
* * * *
It would be tantamount to induced murder to tell
thousands of older motorists that, they are more of a
menace doing 35 than the college kid doing a ticket
meriting velocity. It is a self-evident truth, they wil 1
tell you, that if you go under 40 you can't get killed.
Yet yearly many of these thousands are raked
from life's gambling table not because they were break
ing a law, but because they do not know how to handle
their machine, because their reaclions are fatally slow,
because their sense of depth perception and their
ability to gauge distance is practically nil.
* * * *
Discounting the idiotic and alcoholic speeder,
there is no reason why a young person, if he is phys
ically and mentally sound, should crawl along at 35
over a road that begs for 50. Tests have proven that
he is safer at that speed than his fond parents are
while backing the car out of the garage.
Many old people who couldn't get a license to
drive a wheel chair arc on the roads today, acting
almost as stationary obstacles in the flow of traffic.
They are the first to decry the efficient driving of the
average collegian, who goes when the signal tells
him to, does 50 on the open road, and passes the fum
bling oldsters who sit in a sweat trying to manage a
machine and see where they're going.
