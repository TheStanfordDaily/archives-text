APOLOGIES are due Rosemary
Benet for the carelessness of a
Daily copy editor in deleting that
portion of the "Dark Tower" re
view which said, "Although the play
was a 'mystery-melodrama,' it was
full of comedy, both the rapid-fire
give-and-take variety that Stanford
audiences seem to love and ihe
equally popular kind that is occa
sioned by such characters as the old
maidservant, excellently played by
Rosemary Benet, who extracted the
full measure of humor from linos
and business."
PUBLICITY GA(i gone wrong:
Dramatic Manager Rex Hardy
wanted Our Hasher to carry a story
about one of the cast members hav
ing quintuplets . . . Our Hash said
he wouldn't do it unless Hardy could
find a rat that really was littering
up the psych lab.
GENE BUCK'S voice, on that Will

I Rogers memorial program Saturday,
! sounded like Major Bowes' . . . Nice
gesture on the Prince of Wales'
part, sending that cable to the me
i morial committee . . . Twentieth
! Century-Fox is billing "In Old Ken
tucky" as Rogers' "latest" picture,
not his last, which it really is.
MUSIC NOTES: I like Eddie Fhz
patrick's orchestra. It's smooth and
I sweet without being sickening, like
; Garber and Lombardo . . . but
Vocalist Judy Richards is childish
... Mildred Bailey is singing with
Freddie Bergin's orchestra at De
tioit's Book-Cadillac Hotel.
OFF KEY: Tom Coakley is giving
Virginia Haig some pietty risque
songs to sing . . . But they're darned
clever . . . Jimmy Walsh is com
| peting with his ex-partner, Griff
Williams, by playing at the SF's
| Music Box . . . All coast orchestras
1 seem to be improving.
