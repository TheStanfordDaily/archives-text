Top spot of the week in the world
ol' whirling disks goes to Connie
Boswcll and her recording of those
two sock tunes from "Broadway
Melody of 1936," "You Are My
Lucky Star" and "I've Got a Feel
in' You're Foolin'." It's all Bosweil,
but she's tops in her class. You'll
be especially surprised by the or
chestral background. It's restrained
and simple, featuring a low rhythm
beat that blends perfectly into the
Bosweil style. It. has a continental
feeling, and indicates that La Bos
weil is learning a thing or two from
Lucienne Boyer and the other
French singers. For your informa
tion, you'll find these tunes on Decca
disk, 575.
For the followers of the hot and
hesitatin' brand of music, there's a
new pressing bearing the imprint of
Jimmy Lunccford's sizzling music.
"Thunder, on the 'B' side, is pure
"turn on the heat," with a touch of
sweet-and-hot in the vocal chorus
by Dan Grisson. Personally, I didn't
think that "Babs" on the other side
was quite as good, despite the blue,
blaring beat of some excellent cor
net work. You may like it. Take a
look at Decca disk, 57G.
On the other new Decca record
of the week, Connie Boswcll chimes
in with her sisters to record two
tunes from "Top Hat." You oughl

!to like their new and original in
terpretations of "Cheek to Cheek"
and "Top Hat, White Tie, and Tails."
They've blended two hit tunes, some
good orchestration, and their own
original style into a class 'A' record.
It's Decca disk, 574. â€”Squires
