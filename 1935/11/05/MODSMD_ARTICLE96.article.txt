Should campus traffic laws be cod- !
ified for the use of the students who
drive?
WALLY BROOKE, president of
the A.S.S.U.: "I think that codifica- j
tion of the traffic laws is a fine idea. j
Work is being don? on it now. The
original plan was to codify all the [
rules of Men's Council to define just
how far the Council could go in
treating off-campus violators who '
are not students."
808 GROS, student manager: "1
see no need for codifying the laws
They are simply predicated on com- !
mon sense, and do not need elabo- !
ration. Speeds are clearly defined '
and parking limitations are either
self-evident or clearly marked."
JACQUELINE FLANDERS, vice
president of the A.S.S.U.: "I don't
know much about the traffic prob- j
lem since I don't drive myself, but j
I think that codification of the law:. J
is a very good idea, if Ihe students
would take time to read them."
MARGARET SHAEFFER, prcsi- |
dent of Women's Council: "I think
that would be one of the best steps |
we couid take. It would make it
much easier for the students to have '
some definite place to look for rules i
applying to campus parking and j
speed laws. There should be such a
codification, and both Councils are !
working toward it, hoping to have it ]
by the middle of the year."
GORDON DAVIS, campus cop: j
"There is no need for codification '
of campus traffic regulations. The
only trouble that the students have |
is with the speed laws, and these
arc the same for all municipalities j
throughout the state. Pleading ig- !
norance when brought up for viola- i
tions is just lack of a better ex- [
cuse."
