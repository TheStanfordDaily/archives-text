# Hollywood Holds Heart Throb For Holstein Beauties
## 
### 
HOLLYWOOD, Nov. 4 (/P). —The
lure of Hollywood is felt in almost
every feminine heart.
Take, for example, Gwendolyn
and Genevieve Bossie. They are
young. Their eyes are large, brown,
and trusting. Their figures are good.
Small wonder that they thought
Hollywood beckoned to them,
j Police found them on Hollywood
boulevard, a little bewildered by it
all. They were taken to the police
station but no charges were made.
As Holstein cows go, they had per
fect credentials. There was an "S"
brand on their left hips and State
tubercular tags in their ears.
1 They needed milking, and Jailer
John Ulik obliged.
Some time last night their owner
appeared.
"I don't know how they got out
of the corral," sighed Nick J. Va
lenta of the North Hollywood Dairy,
as he started on the five-mile march
home—but not via Hollywood bou
levard.
