# Injured Men Make Return To Card Line
## Rouble and Hamilton Out Of U.S.C. Game, Says Doctor Roth Black To See Action Grayson Leaves Practice To Welcome Fiancee 
### Herb Diamond 
Bobby Grayson came back yester
day to hold down his post as chief
cog in Tiny Thornhill's Big Red
Machine.
With Grayson's return the Indian
line-up was once more complete and
cripple-free for the first time in sev
eral weeks, although some of the
recently hospitalized warriors were
still troubled with minor ailments.
Bones Hamilton, out on the field
for the second time since his leg
muscle was so badly pulled, trotted
around as he did Monday, limber
ing up his weak arm. The leg
doesn't bother him, he explained,
but its strength is still of unknown
quantity, and he will not risk a re
injury by putting pressure on the
injured member before lie's sure
it will stand it.
Dr. Fritz Roth, team physician, has
advised Bones to strengthen the
muscle gradually by taking a slight
ly heavier workout from day to day.
So Hamilton dons a sweat £uit every
afternoon and trots around the grid
while Tiny scrimmages his charges.
Rouble, Cltnco To Rest Up
Larry Rouble and Porky Cuneo
were in regular uniform, and from
all indications seemed to be ap
proaching top-notch condition.
Rouble's knee has almost fully re
covered. but he still complains about
a kink in one of his thigh tendons.
Both he and Hamilton will see no
service until the Cardinals tackle
Montana ten days hence, while Cu
neo, on the other hand, is in shape to
be called upon in Saturday's tussle
with Troy.
Extra! "Grayson Out of Line-up
Because of Heart Disease"—that's
the way an Oakland newspaper
explained it and, in one sense, it's
based on actual fact. It wasn't
Bobby's leg that kept him away
from Thornhill's scrimmage ses
sion yesterday, but rather his
heart. For while the squad was
being put through its paces Mon
day Grayson was in San Francisco
greeting Christine Williams, the
future Mrs. Grayson, as she step
ped oIT a liner from Honolulu.
Bob Black, who alternates at right
and left guard, has a gash in his leg
that may slow him down a bit, but
nevertheless will not prevent his en
tering the tilt Saturday. And, speak
ing of the sick list, Joe Vigna's face
might have been the battle-ground
for last week'.-; Bronco game. He
left a lot of his hide up in Seattle
and whatever remained can prob
ably be found somewhere on the
stadium turf. But Vigna has stored
up enough fight to keep him in the
midst of iiny gridiron melee, skinned
face or not, and he probably will
come in for more than a few duties
Saturday.
Todd Highly Rated
Fullback Ray Todd, who spelled
Grayson for a while, showed plenty
of speed and power. Todd isn't soon
to be forgotten for the part he
played in Stanford's triumph over
Santa Clara. The Todd-to-Coffis
passing combination was respon
sible for a gain that put the Indians
in position for the tieing tally that
came a few moments later.
Thornhill ran the Big Red Ma
chine through a wide variation of of
fensive tactics in preparation for the
Indian raid on the once all-powerful
gridsters from Troy. Although pro
game dopesters pick Stanford as a
heavy favorite over the Southern
Californians, Indian ovcrconfidence

based on actual fact. It wasn't
Bobby's leg that kept him away
from Thornhill's scrimmage ses
sion yesterday, but rather his
heart. For while the squad was
being put through its paces Mon
day Grayson was in San Francisco
greeting Christine Williams, the
future Mrs. Grayson, as she step
ped oIT a liner from Honolulu.
Bob Black, who alternates at right
and left guard, has a gash in his leg
that may slow him down a bit, but
nevertheless will not prevent his en
tering the tilt Saturday. And, speak
ing of the sick list, Joe Vigna's face
might have been the battle-ground
for last week'.-; Bronco game. He
left a lot of his hide up in Seattle
and whatever remained can prob
ably be found somewhere on the
stadium turf. But Vigna has stored
up enough fight to keep him in the
midst of iiny gridiron melee, skinned
face or not, and he probably will
come in for more than a few duties
Saturday.
Todd Highly Rated
Fullback Ray Todd, who spelled
Grayson for a while, showed plenty
of speed and power. Todd isn't soon
to be forgotten for the part he
played in Stanford's triumph over
Santa Clara. The Todd-to-Coffis
passing combination was respon
sible for a gain that put the Indians
in position for the tieing tally that
came a few moments later.
Thornhill ran the Big Red Ma
chine through a wide variation of of
fensive tactics in preparation for the
Indian raid on the once all-powerful
gridsters from Troy. Although pro
game dopesters pick Stanford as a
heavy favorite over the Southern
Californians, Indian ovcrconfidence
Bobby Grayson came back yester
day to hold down his post as chief
cog in Tiny Thornhill's Big Red
Machine.
With Grayson's return the Indian
line-up was once more complete and
cripple-free for the first time in sev
eral weeks, although some of the
recently hospitalized warriors were
still troubled with minor ailments.
Bones Hamilton, out on the field
for the second time since his leg
muscle was so badly pulled, trotted
around as he did Monday, limber
ing up his weak arm. The leg
doesn't bother him, he explained,
but its strength is still of unknown
quantity, and he will not risk a re
injury by putting pressure on the
injured member before lie's sure
it will stand it.
Dr. Fritz Roth, team physician, has
advised Bones to strengthen the
muscle gradually by taking a slight
ly heavier workout from day to day.
So Hamilton dons a sweat £uit every
afternoon and trots around the grid
while Tiny scrimmages his charges.
Rouble, Cltnco To Rest Up
Larry Rouble and Porky Cuneo
were in regular uniform, and from
all indications seemed to be ap
proaching top-notch condition.
Rouble's knee has almost fully re
covered. but he still complains about
a kink in one of his thigh tendons.
Both he and Hamilton will see no
service until the Cardinals tackle
Montana ten days hence, while Cu
neo, on the other hand, is in shape to
be called upon in Saturday's tussle
with Troy.
Extra! "Grayson Out of Line-up
Because of Heart Disease"—that's
the way an Oakland newspaper
explained it and, in one sense, it's
based on actual fact. It wasn't
