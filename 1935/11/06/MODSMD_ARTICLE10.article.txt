# Classic Works Will Be Played
## 
### 
Works of Schubert, Handel, and
Bach will be featured in the program
of recordings presented by Raymond
Kendall, university organist, this
afternoon at 4:15 o'clock in Room 84.
Auditors will hear a recording of
Schubert's "Symphony in C Major,"
by the British Broadcasting Com
pany orchestra, under the direction
of Adrian Boult.
In recognition of the Bach-Hajidel
anniversary year the new Bach-
Handel album of four records will
be played, including the "Suite in
D" by Bach, selections from Han
del's "Fireworks Suite," and « "Sin
fonia" by Bach, from the Cantata
number 35, "Geist und Seele."
The last of these is played by a
harpsichord and a five-stringed
quinton of old instruments whose
use is almost obsolete—the viola
d'amour, the viola da gamba, and the
four-stringed basse viole.
