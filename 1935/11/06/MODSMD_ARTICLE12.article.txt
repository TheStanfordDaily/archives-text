# Old Stanford Cabin Revered by Miners

### RITA V.S. SZEKERES 
When Senator Lcland Stanford
first came to California during the
gold rush days, he started a general
store in Michigan Bluff, a little town
in Placer County, and the story goes
that his bed was the counter.
One night a strong wind stormed
through the streets and swept off the
entire front of the store. An ex
cited townsman rushed into the
building and found Senator Stanford
peacefully asleep on the counter.
Waking the Senator, the well-mean
ing native explained the calamity,
adding, "Hadn't you better go out
there?"
The Senator blinked and glanced
toward the street beyond the opened
store. "Is there anything I can do
out there?" he asked.
The native shook his head.

"Then what the did you wake
me up for?" the Senator demanded.
Incidentally, it. was for his large
and correct vocabulary that Senator
Stanford was especially noted when
he first came to Michigan Bluff.
There still stands in the little town
a cabin to which natives point with
pride as one of the Senator's first
California homes. Although there is
some doubt as to whether the cabin
is the same one that housed Senator
Stanford, its deserted walls conjure
up pictures of the lusty colorful days
in the Mother Lode country.
Many claim that a fire which
swept Michigan Bluff destroyed Sen
ator Stanford's cabin and also his
store. But the natives still point to
the modest clapboard cottage that
may have been his. and therefore is
preserved in his memory.
