# Copp Down But Not Out; Plans Issue
## 
### 
Discovered in his cell, Old
Boy Copp reviewed the .situa
tion for the football number of
Chaparral, due November 21.
He had been bed-ridden since
Saturday's Daily-Chappie grid
classic, following which he first
missed three of his toes.
'"It's not that I miss them so
much," said Copp, "but it's darn
embarrassing when I want to
recite "little piggie" at night be
fore I go to bed."
Swallowing his emotions,
however, and washing them
down with a gulp of tomato
juice, Old Boy proceeded to
outline "Phingernail Phrolic,"
the murder mystery beginning
in the next issue, and starring
Cad Cancer, stylish Swedish
detective woman.
