# Golden Gate Bridge Directors To Meet
## 
### 
SACRAMENTO, Nov. 5 (A>). â€”
Directors of the Golden Gate
Bridge and Highway District have
been invited to meet with the State
Highway Commisison here today to
discuss the Marin county approach
to the bridge and attempt to settle
a long-standing quarrel.
The directors and other enthusi
asts in the Redwood empire demand
a four-lane approach to the six-
I lane bridge, but state highway en
gineers have recommended a three
lane approach as sufficient to han
dle traffic, with the idea of adding
, a fourth lane when conditions make
it advisable.
