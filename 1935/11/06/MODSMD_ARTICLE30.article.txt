# Rain Halts Italian Push on Makale
## Breathing Spell Is Needed by Fascist High Commanders Ethiopian Chief To Lead Fascists in March On Coveted City 
### 
AT THE FRONT WITH THE
ITALIAN ARMY, Nov. 5
four-pointed drive by more than
125,000 Italian soldiers upon the stra
tegic Ethiopian city of Makale was
hailed today by heavy rains.
A "breathing spell" of two days,
however, was relished by the Fas
cist high command. It is eager to
keep the carefully mapped plan of
advance intact.
The bivouac in the mud of north
ern Ethiopia will allow completion
of truck roads to catch up with the
armies, giving a free flow of sup
plies. Officers, encountering little
resistance except from nature, ex
pressed confidence the Fascist ban
ner would wave over Makale by Fri
day, signalizing success in another
ma;or step in the campaign of occu
pation.
No fight is expected at the gate of
Makale, a caravan center dominating
a rich plain. Italian fliers said the
head coptic priest, or the Aleca of
Makale, has signified a wish to sub
mit through a large white flag
hoisted over his home. The scouting
planes also reported white sheets
were waved by inhabitants and that
the town apparently had been evac
uated by Ethiopian troops.
If Italian plans go well, an Ethio
pian will lead the Fascists into the
coveted city. Degiac Gugsa's native
troops, on the extreme left, are well
in advance and expected to move
into Makale by Thursdayâ€”a day in
advance of the main columns.
