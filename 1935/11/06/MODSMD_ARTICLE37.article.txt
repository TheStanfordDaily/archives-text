# Frosh Work on Pass Defense for Cub Tilt
## Papooses Also Drill On Attack for Little Big Game Saturday Bob Shreve Takes Place Of Gustafson at Guard; Hege Back at End 
### 
Jimmy Bradshaw's frosh football
team doesn't intend to lose the
Little Big Game Saturday on weak
pass defense. The men of '39 con
centrated on correcting this, their
main weakness, in practice yester
day.
Backs and ends of both regular
and reserve teams, led by Assist
ant Coach John Bunn, filled the air
with pigskins, which the first
string succeeded fairly well in
knocking down or intercepting.
Slowness of the secondary defense
against aerial attacks lost the Card
yearlings the U.S.C. game, and has
given them trouble all season.
Since the coaches have little wony
about the defensive ability of the
heavy, powerful freshman forward
wall, little was done yesterday in
the way of line practice, except on
offense. Both passes and running
plays received plenty of attention as
the first-year gridders drilled on
attack.
Bo!) Shreve worked out at left
guard in Fred Gustafson's place
and will probably start against
California. Shreve was a regular
in pre-season scrimmage, but
from the first game until yesterday,
was relegated to the reserves be
cause of his small size. Weighing
only 160 pounds, Shreve has
showed more speed than Gustafson
and is now favored by Bradshaw
as a running mate for huge Frank
McMillan.
The only other change in the
first-string line-up since the San
Jose State game was at right end,
where Walt Hege, his sprained ankle
healed, has replaced Don Butler. Irv
Cummings, whose ankle was also
weak, Ed Gamier, who had a dam
aged shoulder, and the other ex
cripples, are all in shape, or quickly
rounding into it, and should be at
their best for the Bear Cub tussle,
according to Bradshaw.
