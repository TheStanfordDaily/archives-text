IN DEFENSE OF
I CHUCK CHESHIRE
Bright and early Monday tho Daily
I California!! blossomed out with an
! editorial quip that struck this rustic
I Farm across the bay as just a trifle
i foul.
It was evidently written by Cal
editor Henry Schacbt while lie
i was still very, very enthusiastic
I over California's defeat of the
j Uclau Bruins last week-end. The
1. whole piece had a musty air. hut
! when Editor Schacht wound up his
| little bit with a particularly nasty
j dig, that was a trifle too much.
Said he, after eight inches of edi
torial rubbing-it:
"Who is this guy Cheshire?"
Yes, it's probably true that Mr.
I Schacht was trying to be humorous,
j But it is also true that his effort fell
: far short of his goal, if humor was it.
! One can quite easily imagine what
| the gentlemen of Southern Califor-
J nia's Westwood hills would say when
| they saw that line—"Who is this
! guy Cheshire?" They'd say plenty
! 'cause they, and all the others who
i saw the game at Lo.s Angeles last
' week-end, know that Cheshire
: played his usual great ball game
and that he outshone most of Cal's
j backs.
I It is probable that U.C.L.A. will
\ say nothing to Editor Schacht
about his small remark. It is prob
able that the Bruins will swallow
that, along with the defeat, like
gentlemen.
But we, who were beaten by Mr.
Cheshire and his loyal band of fol
lowers, feel justified in a word of
defense, though his own crushed
, forces perhaps deem it wLse to for
j get the matter.
ROSE BOWL BOSSES—
WHO ARE THEY?
: The Rose Bowl Committee scratch
es its head, burns the midnight oil,
; and settles down to let time settle
its worries.
University of California - Uni
j versity of Washington, Stanford
University - California, and
U.C.L.A. - Southern Methodist—
those three games will decide the
issue once and for all. Time only
! will tell.
i But who makes up this Rose Bowl
j committee which does so much mid
; night oil burning, et al? That's not
| widely known, despite great talk on
| the subject.
No, not a group of half-dozen
1 football minded gentlemen of Pasa
dena, but 10 graduate managers, one
j from each conference school, make
up that body.
Each conference school has one
, vote which is sent by telegraph
to the base of operations at Pasa
dena on a prescribed date. The
voting grad managers are to ex
press the general opinion of their
school on the matter.
Then the bid is issued by the Rose
I Bowl officials to the winning team
I which, in turn, selects its own op
ponent and issues an invitation to
that institution to play in the Bowl
of Roses on New Year's Day.

Yes, it's probably true that Mr.

' week-end, know that Cheshire
: played his usual great ball game
and that he outshone most of Cal's
j backs.
I It is probable that U.C.L.A. will
\ say nothing to Editor Schacht
about his small remark. It is prob
able that the Bruins will swallow
that, along with the defeat, like
gentlemen.
But we, who were beaten by Mr.
Cheshire and his loyal band of fol
lowers, feel justified in a word of
defense, though his own crushed

No, not a group of half-dozen

up that body.
Each conference school has one

to the base of operations at Pasa

voting grad managers are to ex
