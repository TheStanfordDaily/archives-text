# 'Il Duce Wants Victory';-Harris

### 
"What Mussolini wants in Ethiopia
j is a military triumph, not the rela-
I tively unimportant economic dorni
j nation of the country," said Dr.
| David Harris, associate professor of
j history, in his lecture on "The Ethio-
I pian Crisis" in the Assembly Hall
j last evening.
Pointing out that the world market
is already glutted with raw mate
rials, to which a controlled Ethiopia
| could add only more confusion, and
| that even Italian Eritrea is sparsely
settled in spite of overpopulation in
i the homeland, Dr. Harris said that
! Mussolini has not fallen for these
I economic arguments. Nevertheless,
| he has threatened a general world
war if Europe interferes with his re
mote colonial ambitions.
Alter tracing the incidents bring
ing on the crisis, the speaker talked
of the recent policies of the three
major nations involved. France, Dr.
Harris said, is thought to have con
cluded a military alliance with Italy,
thereby reversing the attitude of op
position toward II Duce, which she
has consistently maintained since
1885.
England, however, insists that th"
matter be decided by the League of
Nations, also contrary to her pre
vious policy of indifference to Italian
| action.
