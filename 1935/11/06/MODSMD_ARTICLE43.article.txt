# Frosh Soccer Team To Meet Menlo Eleven
## Teamwork Stressed In Practice Session 
### 
| In the second meeting of the two
teams this season, the frosh soccer
squad and Menlo J.C. will tangle on
the home field this afternoon at 4
j o'clock.
Assistant Coach Dick Forhan
i stressed the need for more team
i work and less individual play in
■ yesterday's turnout and had the
squad practice especially on pass
' ing. In the first games of the season
| the men failed to pass the bail
: around much, and it usually became
| Lowe's duty to take the pigskin
j down into scoring territory. Most
! of the offense has centered around
I Harry Lowe, who has proved to be
| one of the most capable players on
j the team.
I Menlo handed the yearlings a 2-1
' defeat last week in a rather sloppy
game. Both teams showed lack of
j experience in their shots and hand
ling of the ball.
As there are only 12 men out for
| the frosh squad, Forhan expressed
the hope that more would come out
next week. He said that there is
plenty of room for new material.
Last year several football men came
out after the frosh season closed and
' developed into good players. For
han hopes that some of this year's
frosh footballers will report next
week.
