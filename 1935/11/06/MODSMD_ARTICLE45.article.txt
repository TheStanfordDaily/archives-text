# "Let the Winds of Freedom Blow"
## Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily Member of the Associated Press Conference Should Attempt To Clear Up Hypocrisy in Pay-for-Athletes Question 
### 
Bill Leiscr, a San Francisco sports column
ist, adds one more suggestion to the long list
of plans by which Pacific Coast colleges can
give financial aid to needy athletes. He sug
gests a "Varsity Club," to be supported by
alumni, which, in season, would house and
feed members of all varsity athletic teams
at each of the universities.
According to present Conference laws,
which provide for a maximum of one meal
per day for athletes, this plan would he ruled
out, but there apparently is no moral reason
why the regulations cannot he changed. From
a practical standpoint, particularly at a pri
vate school such as Stanford, there would be
an almost prohibitive difficulty of financing
the construction of such a club.
However, this plan, like every other aid-lo
athletes suggestion that has been offered in
recent years, does not solve or attempt to solve
the underlying problems of amateur athletics
►—proselyting of athletes and the long-de
manded equalizing of all competing univer
sities.
ITwlcr a system of "unfair competition,"
which is,gaining in usage all over the coun
try—whether conference laws permit no con
cessions whatever to athletes, or whether thes
set a scale of liberal financial advantages foi
football players irregular monetary adjust
ments by some colleges will continue,
schools with the most elaborate offers still will
gel the cream of the prep school football
teams, at the expense of the poorer or more

[ conscience-stricken universities.
The hypocrisy of this situation deserves to
he cleared up. The hest means of doing this,
naturally, would he by a "gentleman's agree
j ment," applicable to university ollieials, stu
l dents, and alumni alike. The Conference,
j moreover, should set up enforcement ma
chinery adequate to deal with any members
who do not abide by the spirit of this "gentle
man's agreement."
There arc hut three other alternatives open
i to the Conference if il is to fortify itself
' against this hypocrisy: it can attempt to en
force the present rules by taking drastic
measures that il has thus far shied away
I from; it can change the regulations so that
I practices that are now on an undercover basis
will be legalized; or il can disband entirely
and leave the settlement of aid-for-athletes
questions in the hands of the individual
schools.
Jonathan A. Butler's well-known "dud"
report of 19«i2 was the only honest attempt
that has been made among Pacific Coast uni
versities to investigate unfair competitive in
ducements to athletes.
II would be a wise move for the Conference
to acknowledge the existence of I his prob
lem and face il squarely at ils December
meeting. II the situation opened to inspection
soon, Mr. Public, who has been hearing an
ever-increasing number of rumors during the
past ten years, will be likely to lose confidence
in the whole theory of amateur athletics.

Bill Leiscr, a San Francisco sports column

of plans by which Pacific Coast colleges can
give financial aid to needy athletes. He sug
gests a "Varsity Club," to be supported by
alumni, which, in season, would house and
feed members of all varsity athletic teams
at each of the universities.
According to present Conference laws,
which provide for a maximum of one meal
per day for athletes, this plan would he ruled
out, but there apparently is no moral reason
why the regulations cannot he changed. From
a practical standpoint, particularly at a pri
vate school such as Stanford, there would be
an almost prohibitive difficulty of financing
the construction of such a club.
