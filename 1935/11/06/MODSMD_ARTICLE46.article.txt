# After Waiting Two Years, Perhaps It Could Be â€”
## 
### 
Long-waiting Bookstore customers will get
a rebate Friday, the first in the memory of
the majority of present students.
But some students who have waited several
years for rebates will not get them unless the
Bookstore extends its rebate days until Mon
day.
Several hundred Stanford men leave for
Los Angeles Thursday and Friday. Although
Friday is an official day of study, the fact
remains that numerous students entitled to
the lirst rebate in two years will not he on
hand to collect it.
No doubt the Bookstore will see its way
clear to continue rebates on Monday, giving
all its customers a chance to benefit.
