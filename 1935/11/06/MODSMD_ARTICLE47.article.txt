# Penny-Wise Roughs Are Slated To Be There
## 
### 
Reluming prosperity gives its boost to the
Concert Scries tonight, as the largest crowd
in recent years troops into the Pavilion to
hear Tito Sehipa, A-l tenor.
Townspeople, more penny-wise than stu
dents, will he much in evidence. They know
that they can hear live concerts for the price
of one or two in the city by purchasing a sea
son ticket.
Students, who pay even less, either are deaf

l<> the cull of art, or lail to appreciate the econ
omy of the concerts on the Farm. Every year,
season ticket sales fail to reach the maximum
allowable.
But tonight there will he few vacancies as
the voice of Schipa fills the Pavilion. The
Vienna Choir Hoys, Trudi Sclioop and her
Comic Ballet, .lascha Heifetz, and Nelson
Eddy follow the great tenor.
It students fail to take advantage of this
economic and artistic opportunity, as has
been pointed out, the loss is their own.
