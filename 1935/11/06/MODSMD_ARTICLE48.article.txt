## A
						SENSIBLE WILL ROGERS MEMORIAL 
### 
Will Rogers Memorial Commission,
570 Lexington Ave.
New York City
Gentlemen:
In my bank statement this month I found a little
card which read: "This bank will accept your contri
bution to the Will Rogers Memorial Fund." Now I
can't make much of a dollars and cents contribution,
because if I did the bank wouldn't have a reason to
send any more statements, but I'm going to contribute
an idea for what to do with that money you're going
to collect. The papers say you don't know the kind
of memorial you intend to establish.
* * * *
Once when somebody seriously suggested actor
Will as a candidate for the presidency, he straightened
up his grinning face and said: "The suggestion is all out
of order. Being president is serious and I don't want
anybody to take me serious 'til I die, and maybe not
even then."
* * * *
That's the statement you ought to base your deci
sion on. You don't have to do something big and noble
for Will Rogers. He wouldn't like it. Take that money
you're going to get and do something Rogers-like with
it. Don't build a statue, endow a foundation, or estab
lish a scholarship.
# * * *
Why not, maybe, go to Washington, D.C., and es
tablish something like the "Congressmen's Escape
from Log-Rollers and Lobbyists." You could call it the
"C.E.L.L." club. Erect a big building somewhere near
the capital with bed rooms, reading rooms, lounges,
bars, a banquet hall, and places to play cards and
pool. And endow the place with a provision that
through it.s doors no lobbyist could pass, and that within
its walls nothing that pertains to politics or the ex
change of votes may be discussed,
# * * *
Keep a big, husky doorman out in front to turn
back anybody who isn't a government man, and re
porters who don't have appointments. Employ broad
shouldered bouncers as waiters and flunkies to see
that no conversation is carried on that is against the
rules. And put. a lot of Will Rogers' best cracks
about congressmen around on the walls to remind
everyone that here is a place of recreation and rest
md that all things serious are taboo.
• • * ♦
Think what a boon such a place would be to weary
f.olon s who can t find a moment's peace from people
who are either trying to buy their vote tit* trade it.
and from pestering newspapermen during the con
gressional session. And try to think whether the man
whose memory it is to perpetuate would approve of it.
Yours for a semi-serious Will Rogers Memorial.
