In regards to Reviewer's Papbook and his lousy
pun on the litter of white rodents in "Dark Tower,'' I
reply with due humility to the critic of Arts and
Litters:
Though it may seem crude and catty,
And it may sound bum and batty,
I must say my Finnan Haddie:
Your literati are litter ratty.
Speeding down that great arterial of commerce,
that great super-highway, the Bayshore, after a Zeta
Psi skating party Saturday night, one Zete junior had
a wreck. No, he didn't run into a drunken driver, a
college professor, or a milk truck, but a COW that had
wandered onto the highway.
Ensconced rampant and en couchant on the radiator,
the divine bovine gave the car a sleek, glossy fur coat,
and also presented a problem. For bossy had climbed
the frame, but how to avoid furr'n entanglements?
The men pulled and hauled, and according to report
which the Zete vigorously denies, pulled ofl the cow's
horns.
Finally a driver came by and honked a pair of air
horns. Stirred to life by the call, the cow sidled dis
consolately off the cement under her own power.
For further information on Bayshore traffic, see
Bull Session—it's pasteurized.

The knife-flickers and the napkin-flickers are hav
ing a pillar to Post etiquette argument. In Roble the
napkin-flicking technique holds forth, while Encina
Commons is the hotbed of the knife men. It's all a
question of "You buttered your ceiling, now you lie
about it." Surreptitiously, the Roble dare devils place
a pat of butter on their napkins, grab the ends to
gether, and suddenly jerk them apart. The butter
then rests on the ceiling until warmed by dining room
heat, when it melts and drips on unsuspecting corri
dor chairmen. The Encina men have a subtle and in
sidious way of getting around the sponsors by throw
ing butter off their knife blades. Bun-juggling (distant
cousin of boon-doggling) is also one of the fine arts.

"How is it that your water in here doesn't taste of
chlorine?" asked a lady of a Cellar hasher.
"Aw, it's just Ihe way they wash the glasses," grunted
a cynical bystander.

Speeding down that great arterial of commerce,
that great super-highway, the Bayshore, after a Zeta
Psi skating party Saturday night, one Zete junior had
a wreck. No, he didn't run into a drunken driver, a
college professor, or a milk truck, but a COW that had
wandered onto the highway.
Ensconced rampant and en couchant on the radiator,
the divine bovine gave the car a sleek, glossy fur coat,
and also presented a problem. For bossy had climbed
the frame, but how to avoid furr'n entanglements?
The men pulled and hauled, and according to report
which the Zete vigorously denies, pulled ofl the cow's
horns.
Finally a driver came by and honked a pair of air
horns. Stirred to life by the call, the cow sidled dis
consolately off the cement under her own power.

The knife-flickers and the napkin-flickers are hav
ing a pillar to Post etiquette argument. In Roble the
napkin-flicking technique holds forth, while Encina
Commons is the hotbed of the knife men. It's all a
question of "You buttered your ceiling, now you lie
about it." Surreptitiously, the Roble dare devils place
a pat of butter on their napkins, grab the ends to
gether, and suddenly jerk them apart. The butter
then rests on the ceiling until warmed by dining room
heat, when it melts and drips on unsuspecting corri
dor chairmen. The Encina men have a subtle and in
sidious way of getting around the sponsors by throw
ing butter off their knife blades. Bun-juggling (distant
cousin of boon-doggling) is also one of the fine arts.

"How is it that your water in here doesn't taste of
chlorine?" asked a lady of a Cellar hasher.
"Aw, it's just Ihe way they wash the glasses," grunted
a cynical bystander.
