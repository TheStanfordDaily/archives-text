Dear Mr. Bernheim:
A short spell back I read in the
paper where you said that Stanford
; women were clever, and Anne Ritchie
j was clever, and there must be some
I mistake, as I am a Stanford woman,
| and I am Anne Ritchie, but I am
| not clever, and your statement has
I caused me no end of embarrassment.
Everybody hates a clever woman
anyway, and many people, including
I myself, beyond to the School of
Thought which believes that there is
i no such thing as a clever woman,
'especially a clever Stanford woman.
But wherever I go now, people say
this is Anne Ritchie who is clever
j because it said so in the paper, and
then they sit back and wait for me
to bo clever, in fact, daring me. And
there is a silence and they all shuf
j fie their feet and put them in spit
' toons, and this'is hard on me and on
j the spittoons.
i And you also said that I was a
j well known literary figure, or some
' thing, and now ferrets think I must
j be Zane Grey or something, when
j really I write for the Girl Scout's
] Gazette and the Kappa Key, and
j Lord knows there's little enough in
' that.
So please put it in your paper that
I am not clever, but a simple home
i girl who likes nothing better than to
j play among my pots and pans in the
I kitchen, taking Welsh rabbits out
of a hat.
Love,
Anne
