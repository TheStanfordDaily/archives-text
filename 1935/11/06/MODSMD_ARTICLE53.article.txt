# SMOKE GETS IN YOUR EYES

The Editor, Sit - :
Orchids for the opinion expressed
in yesterday's editorial on the "no
smoking on the Quad" tradition.
That it was the wish of Mrs. Stan
ford that there be no smoking on
the Quad and that it has been a
respected tradition for years should
be enough to keep any true Stanford
student from violating the unwrit
ten rule.
But if thi.s Ls not enough, and it
seems it is not, the rights of the non
smoking student should be observed.
Examinations are tough enough
without having your neighbor blow
smoke in your eyes.
If the student must smoke, he
might exert himself enough to walk
outside of the Quad to do it. The
exercise would stimulate him and
the non-smoker could write his paper
without eye-wiping interruptions.
Professors could help the situation
by enforcing a "no smoking" rule
during their examinations. With co
operation from the students at least
this part of Stanford tradition may be
saved from the wreckage.
In Sympathy
