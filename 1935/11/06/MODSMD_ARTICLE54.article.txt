# 533 Coed Rooters Buy U.S.C. Tickets
## 
### 
Women have bought more rooters'
1 tickets this year than ever beforeâ€”
j not because they are abiding by the
| "no-date" rule, but because there
| are more women, according to Al
i fred R. Masters, B.A.C. manager.
When the ticket sale for the Stan
ford-U.S.C. game closed at 5 o'clock
yesterday 533 ducats had been pur
chased by women. The total number
sold was 1450, of which 95 were for
the band.
Though earlier in the sale, Masters
feared the rooting section at Los
Angeles Saturday would be the
; smallest of recent years, a last
; minute rush sent the total up to its
usual peak. The small number of
| tickets remaining are on sale as
I preferred general admission tickets.
Sale of rooters' tickets for the Big
; Game between Stanford and Califor
nia on November 23 starts this morn
' ing and will continue until noon

I Saturday. No definite size for the
rooting section has been decided
upon, but students are urged to buy
as soon as possible.
Tickets may be purchased at the
B.A.C. ticket office for $1.65 each, and
additional tickets may be purchased
at the same time. Students have an
option on four general tickets apiece.
! Selling of Big Game ducats to the
general public will begin Monday.
