# Ex Committee To Sponsor A.S.S.U. Pre-Game Dance
## Nine Measures Tabled, Four Passed; Game Jolly-up Shifted 
### 
Tabling nine measures and pass
ing four, Ex Committee last night
concluded a two-hour meeting by
deciding to present a post-Gaieties
dance. As no outside organization
has asked for the date, and as Bob
Gros can provide the Gaieties or
chestra at cut rates, the affair will
be A.S.S.U. sponsored. A committee
will be named to take charge.
L.l.D.'s NEWSPAPER, "Public
Opinion," was the first tabled meas
ure. The publication, if approved,
would be sold on campus. Repre
sentatives guaranteed that it would
not conflict with The Daily, as no
advertising will be solicited. Bill
Millis will consult with Wally
Brooke before final decision is
reached.
SPORT LETTER, asscrtedly earn
ed by Wally Wiget, was the second
deferred measure. Wiget completed
the required number of hours, but
left during a crucial game and was
not awarded a letter. He now has
two minor sports awards, earned
since; and if Ex Committee okays the
first letter he will get a Block S.
WORLD PEACE FEDERATION,
founded this year by Francis Led
erer, wants campus recognition. It
aims to outlaw war by popular vote.
Brooke explained that with the
measure passed, cards will be circu
lated for signatures, and then sub
mitted to legislators as an indica
tion of public opinion.
"People will sign anything," ob
served Gros. "It won't do any
harm." Ex Committee agreed. Rec
ognition was granted, and the next
move is up to the federation.
Y.M.C.A. CONFERENCE of high
school delegates, to be held on the
campus December 7 and 8, wants a
program featuring "Grayson, a pia
no player, and part of the Glee
CJub." Decision was deferred to the
Cardinals.
"Maybe we could subtly show 'em
pictures of the campus. It's a good
chance for some Stanford propa
ganda," said Brooke.
FRANK FULLENWIDER's com
mittee of one, appointed to investi
gate the possibility of establishing a
campus fiction library, will continue
investigations. "I see no reason why
fiction could not be kept in the ref
erence room stacks," he concluded.
Bob Gros suggested that A.S.S.U.
co-operate with the library to en
courage. purchase of fiction, by
promising to add one volume for ev
ery one bought by the library. No
decision was reached.
SENDING THE DAILY to high
schools, a plan to acquaint students
with the Stanford campus, was the
fifth tabled plan.
"There are 350 high schools in
California," reported Editor Bob
Jones. "Total cost for mailing the
papers would come to $115.50."
"Why not get 'em to subscribe?"
queried Luisetti.
B.A.C. REPRESENTATION was
also tabled until further investiga
tion is made. "Students vote on hun
dreds of things they know nothing
about," reported Brooke. He sug
gested that members serve for six
months before voting.
