# Basque Gains; Eye Uncovered
## 
### 
Yesterday morning Frankie Alus
tiza's bandage was removed from his
eye for the first time since his opera
| tion two weeks ago.
Dr. Hans Barkan and his assist
l ants looked into Frankie's eye to
examine the torn retina, and to all
appearances it had pulled back into
place as planned.
Dr. Thomas Kelly, publicity man
ager for the medical association, said
last night.: "At present they cau't
tell Frankie or anyone else that the
operation was successful as a final
statement, since the examination
was made with Alustiza lying down,
and there is a possibility that when
hr sits up the retina may not hold
ir. position."
Up to now, however, the results
; have been favorable, and the actual
j results will be known in 10 days
when the final eye examination will
i be made.
