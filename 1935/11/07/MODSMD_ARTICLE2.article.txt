# Duce, Britain In Compromise
## 
### 
PARIS, Nov. G (/P). â€” Mussolini
and Great Britain, Paris diplomatic
circles said today, have settled their
differences in the Mediterranean.
As a result, Premier Laval of
France renewed his efforts for a
peace settlement to end the Italian
invasion in Kast Africa. The basis
of settlement, apparently, was this:
Mussolini will reduce his Fascist
forces in Libya, bordering Egypt on
the west, to normal strength. In re
turn, the British fleet in the Mediter
ranean will be reduced.
