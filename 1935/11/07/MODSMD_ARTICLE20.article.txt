# U.S. C., Bears Wrangle Over Cohn Mistake
## 
### 
Action of the Stanford Daily in
(Calling Art Cohn, Long Beach Press-
Tolegram sportswriter to account
for false claims, inadvertently
started a squabble between the stu
dent papers of U.C. and U.S.C.
After The Daily ran the story of
Colin's attack on Grayson and
Alustiza, the stoty was copied in a
San Francisco evening paper. The
latter's account said the offending
article was written by "a South
ern California sportswriter," but
the headline used the term
"U.S.C."
A sophomore reporter at Cal
jumped at the story, rewrote the
yarn from the S.F. paper, claiming
throughout that Stanford had de
manded an apology from U.S.C.'s
Daily Trojan. Tom Lawless, Trojan
editor, saw the write-up in scan
ning the Daily Cal, got on his high
horse, and accused the Berkeley in
stitution of "defaming" U.S.C.
The United Press picked up the
Trojan's edit, relayed it back to
Cal, incidentally further garbling
the story by claiming the original
rumor was that a fist-fight between
Grayson and Alustiza had re
sulted in the eye injury, whereas
the false charge was that Alustiza
had quit football because of "bad
blood" between himself and Gray
son, of which the alleged fight was
proof.
Henry Schacht, Daily Cal editor,
felt called on to reply to the Tro
jan's accusations, saying Lawless
had written a fine edit, but that he
was slightly off his base when he
attributed to us a malicious desire
to defame the Trojan," adding "we
have never gone out deliberately to
get any other paper."
