# Pajama-Clad Frosh Visit Roble Tonight
## 
### 
Tonight freshmen will again adorn
♦ heir most colorful pair of pajamas
for tho Encina pajamarino beginning
fit (he Fiji house at 7 o'clock. Down
the Row led by the Cardinal band
and fire engines the pajama-clad
frosh will parade to the gym and the
S.C. rally. After yells and speeches
they assemble at Roble, where the
fairer sex of the Class of '39 will be
serenaded by the patriotic Encina
horde in their "pinkies."
When the clamoring songfest,
"booming" of drums intermingled,
"oompahs" to the tune of a revcr
brant senior razz berry, and other
slanderous yells are over, frosh will
go to the Stanford Theater in Paly,
which will open its doors to all frosh
in pajamas.
The spontaneous enjoyment of the
; annual gay-clad march was nearly
discontinued last year due to pre
vious destruction of property and
sanctity in Ruble Hall, as well as

nearly demolishing the Stanford
Theater. The destruction had to be
replaced by A.S.S.U. funds, and the
situation became fraught when the
freshmen forgot to request a date
for the pajamarino. Ex Committee,
however, voted the parade okeh pro
vided it was to be an organized
performance supervised by Encina
sponsors.
Last year after the rally and at
the Roble serenade, Ruble women
surprised the unsuspecting frosh in
an attempt to extinguish their
torches, missing the flares but giv
ing many loud pajamas a good soak
ing. Three years ago a small group
of more persistent raiders crashed
the gates of the women's hall, storm
ing the corridors and causing a gen
eral rumpus.
The leaders of this year's ' bed
time" procession will be the two as
sistant yell leaders, Dick Stark an
nounces.
