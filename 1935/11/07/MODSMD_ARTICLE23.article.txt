### 
CHICAGO, Nov. 6 (/P).â€”The name
of Mrs. William Wrigley, Jr., widow
of the Chicago baseball and chewing
gum magnate, was added today to
the list of wealthy persons who say
they plan to join the income tax in
spired exodus from Southern Cali
fornia.
Her son, Philip K. Wrigley, dis
closed that his mother has arranged
her schedule of residence so that she
will spend less than six months of
any one year in California.
Mrs. Wrigley thus will follow the
example of William Randolph
Hearst, publisher, and others, who
have assailed the California income
tax as too high.
The Wrigley estate was estimated
at. between $19,000,000 and $30,000,000
in probate and estate tax proceed
ings three years ago. The income
on this, it was estimated would come
within the maximum tax bracket on
which a tax of 15 per cent is levied.
