# Bones To See No Action Saturday; Rouble On Starting Line-up
## Cuneo May Not Play Gridsters Meet Nevers' Stanford 'Trojans' 
### Herb Diamond 
! Thirty-six Indian gridsters, two of
1 whom are yet to be named by Coach
Tiny Thornhill, will board tonight's
j irain for the southland where they
are to attack the somewhat battered
walls of Troy Saturday afternoon.
Included on the roster, as re
leased yesterday afternoon, were
Adams, Beedle, Black, Callaghan,
Rouble, Matthews, Carlson, Grant,
Larson, Mangan, Reynolds, Stone,
Moscrip, Topping, Schott, Dakan,
Trompas, Munger, Coffls, Vigna,
j Bones Hamilton, G. Hamilton, Col
lins, Campbell, Rcisner, Grayson,
Luckctt, Williams, Madlem, Todd.
Paul ma 11, Brandin, Mul.cr, and
Tsoutsouvas.
I'rom a quartet of assorted right
and left guards comprised by Cuneo,
1 Quails, Drace, and Cooke, two more
men will be chosen today, as Tiny
was undecided last night as to
which pair of warriors he would
I take.
Although Bones Hamilton will
climb aboard the train this evening
1 with 35 of his team-mates, Dr.
Fritz Roth, squad physician, has
decreed and Tiny Thornhill has
agreed that Bones will see no ac
tion until the Montana tilt, set
for November 16. But when that
tussle with the Grizzlies docs roll
around, Hamilton will probably
start at the left half post, instead
of at right halfback, the position he
i held down last year.
Hamilton, clad in his sweat suit as
usual, was out for a light workout
yesterday. And he took his usual
I trot around the field, constantly
| limbering and testing the strength
| of his weak limb as he jogged along.
The other cripples, about whom
j Tiny has worried not a little, all
! seemed to be in pretty fair shape.
I Bobby Grayson, Porky Cuneo,
Larry Rouble, and Bob Black
each of whom has caused much
anxiety at one time or another—
were hard at work as the squad
went through yesterday's drill.
Rouble still has a weak tendon
J that sometimes gives rise to a kink
in one of his leg muscles, but he
; definitely will get into the action
!at Los Angeles Saturday. Bob
Black's shin is heavily bandaged,
but the gash under his knee bothers
j him very little so he, too, will prob
ably do his share against the Tro
jans.
A city newspaper erroneously re
ported Grayson as severely injured
| in practice but Bobby himself says
> that he's feeling fine. There is yet a
chance that Cuneo's ankle may keep
him out of the U.S.C. melee; Tiny
isn't certain whether he'll use guard
Porky or not.
Thornhill put his charges first
through a defensive drill against
Emie Nevers' outfit of reserves, who
staged some authentic Trojan forma
tions. The remainder of the after
noon's activities was devoted to
polishing up a varied array of of
; fensive tactics.
Play after play Grayson continued
|to boost the squad's general spirit
with incessant chatter. That fight
and drive will come in very handy
Saturday afternoon. And with to
day's final practice session to top ofT
their preparations, the gridsters
should safely negotiate Ihe next
bump in the Red Toboggan's slide.

Hamilton, clad in his sweat suit as
usual, was out for a light workout
yesterday. And he took his usual
I trot around the field, constantly
| limbering and testing the strength
| of his weak limb as he jogged along.
The other cripples, about whom
j Tiny has worried not a little, all
! seemed to be in pretty fair shape.
I Bobby Grayson, Porky Cuneo,
Larry Rouble, and Bob Black
each of whom has caused much
anxiety at one time or another—
were hard at work as the squad
went through yesterday's drill.
Rouble still has a weak tendon
J that sometimes gives rise to a kink
in one of his leg muscles, but he
; definitely will get into the action
!at Los Angeles Saturday. Bob
Black's shin is heavily bandaged,
but the gash under his knee bothers
j him very little so he, too, will prob
ably do his share against the Tro
jans.
A city newspaper erroneously re
ported Grayson as severely injured
| in practice but Bobby himself says
> that he's feeling fine. There is yet a
chance that Cuneo's ankle may keep
him out of the U.S.C. melee; Tiny
isn't certain whether he'll use guard
Porky or not.
Thornhill put his charges first
through a defensive drill against
Emie Nevers' outfit of reserves, who
staged some authentic Trojan forma
tions. The remainder of the after
noon's activities was devoted to
polishing up a varied array of of
; fensive tactics.
Play after play Grayson continued
|to boost the squad's general spirit
with incessant chatter. That fight
and drive will come in very handy
Saturday afternoon. And with to
day's final practice session to top ofT
their preparations, the gridsters
should safely negotiate Ihe next
bump in the Red Toboggan's slide.
! Thirty-six Indian gridsters, two of
1 whom are yet to be named by Coach
Tiny Thornhill, will board tonight's
j irain for the southland where they
are to attack the somewhat battered
walls of Troy Saturday afternoon.
Included on the roster, as re
leased yesterday afternoon, were
Adams, Beedle, Black, Callaghan,
Rouble, Matthews, Carlson, Grant,
Larson, Mangan, Reynolds, Stone,
Moscrip, Topping, Schott, Dakan,
Trompas, Munger, Coffls, Vigna,
j Bones Hamilton, G. Hamilton, Col
lins, Campbell, Rcisner, Grayson,
Luckctt, Williams, Madlem, Todd.
Paul ma 11, Brandin, Mul.cr, and
Tsoutsouvas.
I'rom a quartet of assorted right
and left guards comprised by Cuneo,
1 Quails, Drace, and Cooke, two more
men will be chosen today, as Tiny
was undecided last night as to
which pair of warriors he would
I take.
Although Bones Hamilton will
climb aboard the train this evening
1 with 35 of his team-mates, Dr.
Fritz Roth, squad physician, has
decreed and Tiny Thornhill has
agreed that Bones will see no ac
tion until the Montana tilt, set
for November 16. But when that
tussle with the Grizzlies docs roll
around, Hamilton will probably
start at the left half post, instead
of at right halfback, the position he
i held down last year.
