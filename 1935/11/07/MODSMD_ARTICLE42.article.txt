# Stanford Varsity Soccermen Seek First Win Today
## 
### 
Again determined to end its row
of defeats and come out on the long
end of the scoring, the Stanford soc
cer team journeys to San Mateo this
afternoon to play the junior college
squad.
In the first game this season with
San Mateo, the Indians lost, 2-0, and
will be out to avenge that defeat.
Stanford has yet to win a game.
The main trouble lies in the forward
line, especially the insides. The de
fense has been good; in fact, Coach
Dick Bullis has no complaint to
make in that department at all. He
has made numerous changes in an
effort to strengthen the offense but
as yet has not found a satisfactory
combination.
The outcome of today's game will
depend almost entirely on the way
the forward line functions. What is
needed most of all is more team
work and if the team can concentrate
more on this phase and less on in
dividual play, it will have a good
chance to break into the scoring col
umn, according to Coach Bullis.
