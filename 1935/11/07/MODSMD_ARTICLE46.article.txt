# Water Poloists Leave for Los Angeles Tonight
## Indians Face Crucial Test In Southland Tankmen To Meet Bruins Tomorrow, Trojans On Saturday 
### 
A determined band of var.sity
water poloists, totally unlike the
squad that suffered its only defeat
of the season several weeks ago at
the hands of California, will entrain
tonight for Los Angeles.
Tomorrow afternoon that Stan
ford tank septet invades the lair
of the undefeated Bruin at West
wood, where it will face the high
est rated team on the Coast.
Coach Nort Thornton's Indians, it
must be admitted, are the under
dogs, but they aren't trekking
south just to accept a drubbing.
Since they fell before the smash
ing onslaught of the Berkeley Bears,
the Cardinals have been displaying
an entirely different brand of water
polo. They crushed Troy, 13-2, and
continued in the victory vein to
down the Olympic Club twice in
succession, 3-2 and 8-5. Such per
formances were all more impressive
than the Berkeleyites' showing
against the same opponents. Their
more recent record reads U.C. 6.
U.S.C. 0; U.C. 6, Olympic Club 5:
and U.C. 11, U.S.C. G.
The Farm swimmers will face
the same Uclan outfit tomorrow
that they eked out two wins over
in last year's Coast conference. In
both instances the Indians were
only able to nose out the Bruins
by single point margins.
Saturday morning the Stanford
tank artists will tangle with the
Trojans for the second time this
season. Chances for an Indian tri
umph are slightly better in this tilt,
since it was only two weeks ago
that the Cardinals slaughtered
Coach Fred Cady's men from Troy,
and they are favored to repeat their
13-2 win.
In both of the southland games
(his week-end Thornton's charges
will pit the famed Hungarian of
fensive system, featuring fast
breaking and short passing, against
the American tactics, which cen
ter about a long passingâ€”tip shot
attack.
The following men have been
chosen to make the trip to Los An
geles: Co-captains Wally Wiget and
Bill Woodard, guard and sprint, re
spectively; Bill Clemo, guard; Bob
Hoover, guard; "Suds" Sutherland,
forward; Chuck Giffin, forward;
Duri Peterson, guard; Bob Has
lacher, goalie; and Ben Voss, cen
ter back.
