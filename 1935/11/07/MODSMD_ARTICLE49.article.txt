GRAYSON OUT?
NO—NO—NO
| What's all this we read about
I Bobby Grayson out of the U.S.C.
j game? Tiny Thornhill would like to
j know where it comes from. Campus
, representatives of City sporting
| sheets know nothing about it. Bobby
| himself can't understand it.
But still a United Press dis-
I patch from the Stanford campus
| appearing Wednesday morning
i declares Grayson probably out of
| the Trojan affair next Saturday.
I And the U.P. correspondent here ,
i on the Farm sent no words to that
effect in his nightly report.
Earlier in the week one of Stan
ford's linemen was theoretically in
the hospital with a broken leg. That
' was Bob Mangan. Monday night the
word circulated that Bob was in- J
jured, though no one, not even Man-
I gan, knew anything about it.
Then Tuesday morning Bob was
called to the phone and asked if
he didn't have a seriously injured
leg. Well, Mr. Mangan glanced
down at a perfectly healthy limb,
was forced to reply that he was
sorry but he still was in posses
sion of fine pedal extremities.
The Mangan yarn didn't reach the |
j paper and "ink stage but this last 1
! one about Grayson really made the
| press.
FARM SUSCEPTIBLE
i TO INJURY TALK
It's not a difficult job to start a !
I rumor about injuries to this 1935!
| Stanford varsity. If it were said
1 that Tiny Thornhill had tripped over
; a blocking dummy and would be out ;
! for the season, there are some who'd '
i be tempted to believe it.
I'or it's been just one injury
( after another for Stanford—until
; last Saturday — and the weekly

"out for season" story is a regular
feature.
First it was Bones Hamilton and
Bobby Grayson injured in the San
Jose State game. Both are still try
ing to get over those jolts. And then
came Keith Topping with a broken
rib, incurred during mid-week off
the football field. Then the BIG
BLOW —Frankie Alustiza out for the
season. That broke in the mid-week,
too.
Next in line was Chet Olcott out
for the season with a knee twisted in
a week-day scrimmage. Larry Rou
ble and Bob Cuneo out after the
Washington game with a cracked

knee cai'tilage and strained ankle,
respectively.
And in between times Woody Ad
ams and Monk Moscrip got theirs
for two or three days with battered
limbs. Bob Black is wearing yards
of tape to cover a bad shin bruise
now.
