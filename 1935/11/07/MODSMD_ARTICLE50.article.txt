# Frosh Engage In Final Brill For Cub Tilt
## Zagar Expected To Be In Shape for Saturday's Little Big Game 
### 
Unwilling to risk injuries before
the Little Big Game Saturday, Jim
my Bradshaw ran his frosh football
team through a brisk signal drill but
no scrimmage yesterday. The regu
lars took the field against a mixed
outfit composed of assistant coaches
and reserves for the first part of the
session, and a team of blocking dum
mies later in the afternoon.
The motley aggregation repeated
its Tuesday performance of tossing
passes to strengthen the first
string's aerial defense. The dum
mies represented the California
frosh line. In the offensive drill,
Bradshaw's regulars worked pri
marily on passing plays, although
reverses off tackle and around end
also received plenty of attention.
First-string ends of the season's
start were paired yesterday, as Irv
Cummings took over Andy Stojko
vich's left end position, opposite
Walter Hege, who replaced Don
Butler Tuesday. Hege and Cum
mings have been in and out of the
line-up this season with injured
ankles, and even now, it is not cer
tain just who will be the starting
ends against the Bear Cubs.
Pete Zagar. whose hand was cut,
watched yesterday's practice from
the sidelines, but should be in
shape by Saturday. The big tackle
may even engage in the last
workout today. Byron West play
ed his position last night, oppo
site Dave Carnahan.
Bob Shreve, small but fast and
clever guard, was still with the regu
lars yesterday, and will probably
start the Little Big Game. Frank
McMillan was the other guard, and
Dick Sutton the center. Ed Gamier
was at quarter, Pete Fay and Bill
Kirsch at halves, and Wally deWitt,
newly elected captain, at full.
