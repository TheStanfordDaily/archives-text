# "Let the Winds of Freedom Blow"
## Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily Member of the Associated Press Hypocritical Trend in Sports At Last May Be Eliminated by Alumni Action

The problem of giving linancial aid to ath
letes was gone over with a fine-tooth comb last
Sunday at a potentially significant meeting
of unofficial representatives of the alumni
associations of the "Hig Four" California uni
versities Stanford, California, I'.C.L.A., and
U.S.C.
No definite action was taken, but the alumni
representatives indicated they are optimistic
over the chances of fashioning a constructive
program that will regulate unfair competi
tion for athletes in the four California col
leges.
The possible significance of this meeting
is clear, since the first move in solving the
pav-for-athletes question obviously lies with
the alumni of the universities involved. No
rules set down by the Pacific Coast Confer
ence can be effective it the alumni, who fur
nish nearly all of the cash that goes into any
hypocritical and corrupt system of easing the
football player's linancial burden, are not con
eertedly behind these conference rulings.
It is too easy for alumni, who so desire, to
evade the rules. There are too many subtle
ways for these graduates, interested in seeing
their alma mater corner the "cream of the
prep school crop," to put up the capital for a
"friend's" education and still give a "lily
white" appearance.
Any successful house - cleaning propram
must change this alumni desire to help, 1111-

controllable by legislation, to a "gentleman's
agreement" basis. Hence, the lirst move lies
with the alumni themselves.
The lirst assumption must he that the
alumni of all involved schools are gentlemen
and can be trusted in a gentleman's agree
ment. From here, representatives of the con
cerned alumni associations can draft a pro
gram that will set forth, in black and while,
exactly what is legitimate and what is a
breach of the agreement. An understanding
of this type may be as broad or as narrow in
scope as the four associations represented
deem advisable; but ;it least it will put all of
the schools in an equal position.
Under Ibis set-up, any alumnus who per
sists in helping "the old school" beyond the
point that is decided as fair aid for athletes
will have no support either from Ihe univer
sity concerned or from his brother-alumni
those who <irr gentlemen.
if :i further means of enforcement is con
sidered advisable, the four schools may em
ploy a commissioner to thoroughly investi
gate every rumor that is circulated concern
ing violations of the agreement.
A bouquet to the alumni associations who
have already started negotiations to clear up
this hypocrisy problemâ€”concerted action by
them may lead to a constructive elimination
of the subterfuge involved in helping athletes;
it is with them that any actual solution of the
problem must begin.
