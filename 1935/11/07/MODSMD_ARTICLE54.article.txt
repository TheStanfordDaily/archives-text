# Frosh Get Their Chance To Play Kid-Stuff
## 
### 
To Stanford men only two forms of organ
ized childish amusement remain--the Mud
tight and the Pajamarino. Although a Sin
dent Manager jumped the gun two years ago
and decreed its abolition, the Pajamarino is
still present will he held tonight in fact.
General idea is for as many frosh as pos
sible to gel into as goofy pajamas as possible
and as little else as is necessary. Thev then
go to the rally, thence to Roble, and wind up
by "crashing" the Stanford Theater, whose
alert manager now prefers swinging wide tie
portals to the pajama-elad, rather than letting
them swing the portals at him.
Three years ago some thirty-odd hearties
proceeded to "crash" Roble too, much to the
disconcertment of the efficient sponsors of
Roble and Eiicina who promptly bounced the
offenders. Roble gals at that time thought It
incumbent upon themselves to run screaming

from the windows as Roughs climbed the ivy
toward the balconies.
Last year the girls appeared less frightened,
dumping much refuse and water on the lads
in dishabille below. This year possibly the
humor of the situation will bring a more ac
ceptable reaction from the Robleites —say,
one of condescension and amusement.
After all, the Pajamarino is one of the
puerile pastimes remaining to Stanford; as
such it may well be kept clean, ludicrous, and
enjoyable to all.
