Spread on the El Toro tables Tuesday night was a
sumptuous feast, for honoring the eating club were
President Wilbur and Dean Culver. Scrubbed faces,
angelic smiles, perfect manners, the best of silver,
the cleanest of napery were the order of the evening.
First Butch occurred rather early. Two of Toro'.-
political powers were engaging the Dean of Men in
conversation. Power number one offered a cigarette
to power two. Power two took one, nudged power one,
and suggested he offer one to the dean. Power one com
plied.
"Thanks," said the dean, and reached in the package,
only to find he had been too late.. Power two was
already smoking the last one.
The second incident occurred in the middle of the
meal. During one of the lulls in the conversation,
there came a knocking at the door. In popped the face
of one of the urchins who hawk the Curtis Publish
ing Company's periodicals from the steps of Roble
Hall to the Mausoleum. Now there is something of a
Stanford regulation prohibiting any but Stanford stu
dents from soliciting business in the halls, but these
moppets have piekcd up the college disregard for tra
ditions and ordinances as quickly as they have picked
up the profanity.
The urchin ogled at the distinguished gathering,
finally spotted a tall, dark figure at the end of (he room.
"Hey-yy-y Wilbur," he screeched. Th_> president
looked up.
"Yes?" he said.
Up ambled the little visitor to the president:
"Scorge (unidentified, fortunately) says you want to
buy a Post."
Good-naturedly, Dr. Wilbur took a nickel out of
his pocket and bought the magazine.
Everyone chuckled und returned to the heavy
business of feeding.
About 20 minutes later, there came another knock
at the portal. The waif again violated the purity of
the atmosphere. "Hey, Wilbur," he screeched.
"Yes?" said the president.
"It wasn't Scorge, it was Scrooge."
"Well, it's all the same to me, you have my nickel
now," replied the president.
At the risk of being anticlamactic, Our Hasher
adds the information that the mysterious Mr. Scrooge
was a disaffected Toro, eating that night at the El
Catnpo hangout.
Winchelling: Now enjoying a honeymoon arc a
former managing editor of The Daily and his bride,
who arc driving the automobile of no less a person
lhan Mr. Herbert Hoover.
Wong, head man of Wong's kitch, makes this
weather prediction: "Lots noise tonight, yellum, bum
sing, too muchee noise, velly bum."
Sing, the second boy, has this to add: "Velly bum."
This is all in reference to the S.C. rally of this
evening, next.
Also in reference to the S.C. rally of this evening,
next, is a letter received by The Daily managing edi
tor. from an official on the Daily Trojan.
"Here is the picture of Earnest Bishop, president of
A.S.S.C.. to which you are weltome and need not
bother to return (the mat. I mean, not the student body
president).
"On second thought, we'd much rather have the
mat back than the student body president. If we
can have one without the other, so much the better.'
r.'r. E.unes will be at the rally tonight, too.
