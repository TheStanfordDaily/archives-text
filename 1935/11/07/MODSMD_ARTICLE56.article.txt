## LETS GET OFF THE FENCE 
### 
Every fall the papers are full of it—is football pro
fessional or amateur? Are football players paid or not?
Should they receive compensation for their work or
shouldn't they?
These topics, resurrected whenever an athletic scan
dal breaks, only befog a vital issue. They are in
total disregard of the paramount fact that many foot
ball players are helped, either with cash or credit ex
lended by the university or by more or less affiliated
groups. Under present circumstances, many of the
nation's colleges do not face the question of whether or
not to pay, but whether or not to admit they pay.
i- * * >!:
Because universities deem subsidization of athletes
out and out commercial and morally degrading to both
themselves and the players, and because some of them
believe that the public hates the idea of mixing ama
teur sports and dough, they spread the idea that their
football players get not a penny, in credit or cash.
True enough, buying a gridiron performance for
coin of the realm, making a palpable '"deal" with grid
ders, is generally agreed to be dirty, filthy, and rotten.
But is there actually anything so morally unjustified in
making an education possible for someone who would
otherwise not be able to obtain it? That, after all, is
what academic scholarships do.

A great number of footballers on crack university
teams would be at some piddling job or on relief if
it were not for the fact that their physical and mental
abilities have commercial value to colleges. Because
they receive compensation for those abilities they have
a chance at the books and the professors. Is their pay
ment in football lime any worse than our payment in
cold cash on registration counters?
And is there any reason to believe, furthermore, thai
"scholarship" football players are "working for a
living" when they block, kick, and carry? It is cer
tainly hard to believe that any man or group of men
could put out the physical energy necessary to playing
football while in school merely to balance the account.
Much more reasonable is the belief that they are on
the gridiron because ihey like the game and want to
win for their university, for the institution that has
given them more than aid, credit, or cash—an oppor
tunity for an education.

Nevertheless, American universities seem to be so
morally pure that the idea of paying athletes nauseates
them. What should practically turn them green with
retching is paying and then lieing about it.
