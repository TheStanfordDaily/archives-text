Refund payments on Stanford
Bookstore profits for last year will
be made starting Friday, and are to
continue until all rebates have been
paid out, according to Raymond Sta
ger, manager.
Mr. Stager says the refund will
total about $300, representing the
Bookstore's profit from September,
1934, to August, 1935. The profit
amounts to 3 per cent on the $26,000
worth of signed sales tags turned in.
The refund is the first to be made
in two years.
Rebates will be paid on the net
amounts of individual purchases of
more than 50 cents, as indicated on
the signed sales receipts deposited in
the bookstore.
To obtain refunds, students who
turned in receipts for purchases last
year need only call at the store and
give their names, Mr. Stager adds.
