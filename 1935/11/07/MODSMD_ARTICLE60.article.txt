# GRIPES AND MORE GRIPES

### 
The Editor, Sir:
Daily has recently been lax in
obtaining correct news, has missed
much altogether, and has allowed
incorrect statements in Vox Campi
of a type which used to be corrected
pass unnoticed.
Latest error in Vox Campi was
in the smoking article of yesterday.
Non-smoking on the quad was not
a tradition set up by Mrs. Stan
ford. May I inform the campus as
to the real start of this custom.
Quoting from David Starr Jor
dan's '"Days of a Man," we find:
"Before the first week had passed,
the 'student body,' already organized,
passed a resolution that there should
be no smoking in the Quadrangle
(for which we all felt a kind of rev
erence) nor in any of the academic
buildings."
Although Mrs. Stanford might
have been instrumental in passing
the rule, it was in the form of a
student resolution, and as such is
well within Ex Committee's prov
ince.
Daily has been remiss in two other
campus matters. The first: the old
"hello" spirit which has long ex
isted. Some few freshmen and new
students have caught the spirit, but
the campus is not half a.s conscious
of this worthy custom as it should
be. Last year's Daily editor made
the campus "hello"-conscious with
in a few weeks.
Second point: rooting section.
Campus consensus is that some
thing is lacking; something is
wrong. Primarily, how can a root
ing section yell if it can not hear
what the yell is? The public ad
dress system has dead spots. Pos
sibly a return to megaphones
would let the section into the se
cret of what the next yell is to he.
Are our yell leaders crcam-pulTs?
Furthermore, the selection yells
and songs has been as lousy a.s I've
ever heard. Since when has th"
song, "The Cardinal Is Waving,"
been proper for the Santa Clara
game? Since when has the axe yell
been designated for use at five min

] ute intervals against any old oppo-
I nent? Why does the skyrocket no
' longer open the games?
Pleasant dreams to the yell lead
ers, Daily, and Ex Committee dur
ing their sound sleep of autumn
quarter. 191J5!
How's about some of the rest of
; you old-timers cracking through and
| helping me in this fight for Stanford
| traditions.

We're getting hoarse screaming
for these things. We've only run
19 editorials on traditions so far

Although Mrs. Stanford might
have been instrumental in passing
the rule, it was in the form of a
student resolution, and as such is
well within Ex Committee's prov
ince.
Daily has been remiss in two other
campus matters. The first: the old
"hello" spirit which has long ex
isted. Some few freshmen and new
students have caught the spirit, but
the campus is not half a.s conscious
of this worthy custom as it should
be. Last year's Daily editor made
the campus "hello"-conscious with
in a few weeks.
Second point: rooting section.
Campus consensus is that some
thing is lacking; something is
wrong. Primarily, how can a root
ing section yell if it can not hear
what the yell is? The public ad
dress system has dead spots. Pos
sibly a return to megaphones
would let the section into the se
cret of what the next yell is to he.
Are our yell leaders crcam-pulTs?
Furthermore, the selection yells
and songs has been as lousy a.s I've
ever heard. Since when has th"
song, "The Cardinal Is Waving,"
been proper for the Santa Clara
game? Since when has the axe yell
been designated for use at five min

] ute intervals against any old oppo-
I nent? Why does the skyrocket no
' longer open the games?
Pleasant dreams to the yell lead
ers, Daily, and Ex Committee dur
ing their sound sleep of autumn
quarter. 191J5!
How's about some of the rest of

We're getting hoarse screaming
for these things. We've only run
19 editorials on traditions so far
this volume.—Ed.
The Editor, Sir:
Daily has recently been lax in
obtaining correct news, has missed
much altogether, and has allowed
incorrect statements in Vox Campi
of a type which used to be corrected
pass unnoticed.
Latest error in Vox Campi was
in the smoking article of yesterday.
Non-smoking on the quad was not
a tradition set up by Mrs. Stan
ford. May I inform the campus as
to the real start of this custom.
Quoting from David Starr Jor
dan's '"Days of a Man," we find:
"Before the first week had passed,
the 'student body,' already organized,
passed a resolution that there should
be no smoking in the Quadrangle
(for which we all felt a kind of rev
erence) nor in any of the academic
buildings."
