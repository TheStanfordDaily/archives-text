### Phil Bernheim 
Tito Schipa, whom many cull the
world's greatest tenor, sang for Stan
ford last night, and Stanford re
sponded whole-heartedly.
The glorious melodies left linger
ing in one's memory are ample praise
of the thrill of his voice. And the
applause that thundered, tritely but
truly, throughout the Pavilion is
ample testimony to Schipa of Stan
ford's appreciation.
Indeed, the almost capacity audi
ence grew so enthusiastic that mere
Applause proved too inadequate, so
Schipa was introduced to the col
legiatc custom of foot-stamping.
Easily the favorite of the audience
was Schipa's second group of num
bers, including as it did many of the
favorite opera selections. The group
opened with Lehar's "Du Bist Meine
Sonne," which demonstrated again
that Lehar is a master of shimmering
melody. Then the group continued
with the Ossian song from the opera,
"Werther," the always lovely "M'Ap
pari" from "Martha," and "Una
Furtiva Lagrima" from "Elisir
d'Amore."
Sustained applause brought Schipa
back for more opera, this time the
delicate "Reve" from "Manon." This
was followed by another favorite,
"Princessita," and then a Neapoli
tan melody whose Italian title proved
too complicated to catch.
Encores to the final group included
the ever-popular "La Donna e Mo
bile" from "Rigoletto"; "I Shall Re
turn," which Schipa himself wrote
and which many hope is a prophecy;
and another Neapolitan song, one
which anyone would recognize but
whose title again escaped certainty.
Benato Bellini, accompanist of the
evening, played two groups of num
bers, and two encores after the latter.
