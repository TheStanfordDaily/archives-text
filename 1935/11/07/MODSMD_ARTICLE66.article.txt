# DIANA'S DIARY
## 
### CO-ED SHOPPER 
Deary Diary: Since the weather's
all that gets talked about these days,
I should say the cold wind blew a lot
of good shopping news my way.
First is the seasonal note about legs
and how to keep them warm. The
Diana method is with those light
weight, but oh, so cosy, silk and wool
hose at MARIAN SEIMAS', 534 Ra
mona. Prices are $1.00 or $1.50. Then
in case you're having fountain pen
trouble there's WIGHTMAN'S, 36G
University, with a marvelous selec
tion of Parkers and Schaeffers —
pens are a good Christmas thought,
incidentally. The room-mate had a
birthday Sunday, so what did I do
but get her one of those sweet
bubble vases on a mirror stand that
I've been coveting at the FLOWER
SHOP, 175 University. They're per
fect for bedrooms and feature the
fact that they hold just a few posies.
Academic note of the week is an "A"
in my poli sci report—due, I must
confess, to the super typing of the
ASSOCIATED STENOGRAPHERS.
When I passed the word that their
rates for weekly and term papers
are from ten cents a page, I sent a
stampede to their office at 443 Bry
ant. Let Byrd discover the South
Pole, I discovered Lavendomeal!
It's that scented bath softened of

j Yardley's, and I first saw it when I
got one of their guest room toilet
sets for the house—at the UNIVER
SITY PHARMACY, 134 University.
I know where to lure a man for
j "Tea for Two." It's JEROLD'S, the
smart new restaurant at 229 Hamil
| ton. And they have delicious lunches
j and dinners. I was glad to hear that
the WALK-OVER, 220 University,
had a new supply of crepe soled ox-
I fords in blue, brown, and gray of
| suede. They've been a sell-out to
co-eds. LYDIA'S $4.95 permanent
takes the campus by storm on ac
count it includes a cut, Salakuta
shampoo, and a formal wave coif
feur. Phone her at 22692. Last is the
big excitement about the U.S.C
game. I'm going south for it and a
gala week-end is planned by all.
| The occasion called for a new formal
and I'm mad about the one I got al
MARY ELIZABETH'S, 119 Univer
i sity. In that goldy-grccn shade
j called mint, made of a very heavy,
j rough crepe with a high twisted
neckline and practically no back.
The finishing touch is a wide, jew
el-studded Oriental girdle—and the
price is miraculous. I was also im
pressed by her array of sports felts
! in football colors—they match any
' dress. (Adv.)
