An ideal Xmas
PRESENT
for this time of year
\
If you have some friend, relative, or sweet
heart who would like to keep wise on campus
nws send him, it, or her the Stanford Daily.
Don't try to give friend Joe all of the news in
one letter, send him the Daily. Don't try to de
scribe track meets to uncle Jake; Send him the
Daily. Don't try to turn girl friend, Josephine,
green with envy about the Masque Ball by
*
paltry correspondence; Send her the Daily. In
short, the Daily is an ideal Christmas present
for this time of year.
