Alpha Kappa Lambda was last
night declared winner of the Bruce
Macon Tarver memorial scholarship
and trophy by the Interfraternity
Council through its president, Ed
Littlefield.
Until late last night it was un-
certain whether Alpha Kappa
Lambda or Alpha Tail Omega had
won the awards, because of a mis
understanding of the computation
system.
The Tarver scholarship is awarded
on the basis of the present year's
standing times improvement noted
over the preceding year. The cup is
given to the fraternity holding the
highest scholastic rating.
The fraternity winning the schol
arship apportions it among the
three most deserving members of
the house. Each fraternity on the
campus subscribes to the scholar
ship by the month, a total sum of
$.'524 being raised.
The Interfraternity Council com
mittee on scholarship composed of
Alec MacKenzie, Chuck Fontius and
Warren Munro, computes the per
centages from statistics released by
the Dean of Men's office.
...When questioned concerning his.
opinion of the scholarship, Presi
dent If.ay Lyman Wilbur said:
"Several representatives of houses
have questioned me concerning
this scholarship. lain very inter
ested in anything that furthers
this scholarship. I am very inter
tcrnitics and I believe this schol
arship to be very worthwhile. Also,
I wish to extend my congratula
tions to Alpha Kappa Lambda for
their excellent standing."
George C. Culver, dean of men,
considers this scholarship a "fine in
centive for better scholarship in fra
ternities and a fitting memorial to one
of the finest men to ever attend
Stanford."
