# Stepping the Right Way -â€” Toward World Peace
## 
### 
Before the last Ex Committee meeting came
the World Peace Federation, asking and gel
ling the right to distribute on campus cards
which would attempt to outlaw war by popu
lar vole. II the million student signatures
aimed at can be garnered, a potent plea for
peace can be placed before legislators.
Last college poll on war found American
students 5 to 1 against any invasion of for
eign soil by America under any circumstance.
This would indicate a sympathetic feeling
toward the new movement, ii' the organizers
are active enough to overcome student indo
lence.
No one is optimistic enough to believe that
all thai has to be done to prevent war is to
find by ballot definitely that a majority are
against it, then sil back complacently and
expect peace to prevail forevcrmore.
Signing on the dotted line is not enough; it
is not highly effective; but il is stepping out
in the right direction.
