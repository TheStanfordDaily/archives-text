UNQUALIFIED CRITICS
Many of the dissatisfied and disgruntled claim the
man in the White House is due for some smoke-ups . . .
that, he has been doing "D" work in America's course
of recovery . . . Maybe so . . . But even though Mr.
Roosevelt deserves cinch notices ... he does not deserve
them at this early stage from those who are unquali
fied to give them.

By unqualified we mean those habitual statement
makers who are professional protesters—who are for
ever campaigning against something which appears to
be very noble but obviously is in the realm of the
ulterior. A sputtering example is one Silas H. Strawn,
reactionary extraordinary, who last week made a
score of front pages with an anti-New Deal article
claiming the U.S. debt is rising $7,000 a minute.
Mr. Strawn, a big-wig Chamber of Commerce man,
last spring hit a new high as a conservative with a
college commencement speech in which he said: "I am
unable to sympathize with the elastic conscience of
those who inveigh against the capitalist system while
on the pay-roll of a college or university whose budget
or whose existence is due to the philanthropic gen
erosity of those whose industry and frugality have
enabled them 1o make an endowment."

Noble words, indeed, those. But if anvone should
call Mr. Strawn a foe of free expression and an
enemy of democratic principles which makes capi
talism possible, he would protest and make speeches
and see red for weeks. Similarly, if someone should
brand him as a political reactionary who is intolerant
of any legislative moves which set precedents, depa: i.
from tried and proven ways, and proceed off on an
unexplored means to an end, he would write articles,
quote figures, and issue statements forevermore.
Silas Strawn, and others like him, usually ballyhoo
under the cloak of Americanism, but back of this talk
of Americanism lies the worship of that demigod of
the lower world, orthodoxy, and back of orthodoxy
turk the so-called vested interests. And vested in
terests are afraid of a lot of things—from what teach
ers say to the youth of the land, to governmental
experiments. —John McClelland
