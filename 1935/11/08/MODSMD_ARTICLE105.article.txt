AMERICANISM: In Los Angeles,
I it is illegal for "two or more men
i or boys over 14 to ogle women or
! girls in public places." . . . But the
I ordinance says nothing about mass
ogling of men by girls or women.
TITO SCHIPA can be added to the
] long list of arlists who have found
j the Pavilion an annoying place in
i which to perform. After his first
J lumber, Schipa turned to someone
standing behind the platform and
whispered hoarsely, "Too much wind
here." . . . Norman Barnes, last year's
concert manager, drew almost 'as
jmuch applause as Schipa when ho
stepped on the platform to raise the
piano top.
AT LAST! We've got a choice
item on Our Hasher. Just one week
ago he wrote, "We learn from our
H-men that four "Our Hasher Sez"
skits were turned in to the Gaie
ties committee." tJ
Your Reviewer has just learned
from his R-men (and we mean mon!)
that all four of 'em were rejected.
As was one written by Our Hasher
himself!
"COMMON FLESII," opening at
the Columbia Theater in San Fran
cisco Monday, is rumored to be a
brain child of no less a person than
Mae West. Officially credited to Ar
thur Jatim and Bob Forteppc, col
umnists and critics are hinting that
the real author is the gal who put
real meaning in Horace Greeley's
famous slogan.
The play i.s said to be one of the
most unblushingly outspoken plays
ever to reach the stage in California.
It tells the story of a hardened siren
of the city who marries into a re
spectable New England home and
causes endless havoc therein. The
play's frankness has caused it. to be
compared to such controversial
works as "Desire Under the Elms"
and "Dishonored Lady."
