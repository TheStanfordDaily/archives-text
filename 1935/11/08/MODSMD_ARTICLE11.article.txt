# Mussolini Refuses Red Cross Succor
## 
### 
II Duce and Haile Selassie don't
agree on the value of Red Cross
aid in their war operations, accord
ing to John Cahill, campus director
of the society's annual drive for
funds to open Monday.
"The International Red Cross,
which cares for the war injured,
lias offered its assistance to both
Italy and Ethiopia," Cahill said
yesterday. "Mussolini, carrying out
his policy of self-dependency, re
fused the offer and declared his
nation capable of handling the sit
uation. The Ethiopian emperor
accepted with thanks."
The international organization,
Cahill explained, is maintained
through co-operation of national so
cieties. In the event of war it is
free to call upon any or all of them
for financial aid.
"Although money received in the
campaign Monday will be set aside
for use in the United States gen
erally," the director stated, "con
tributors may mark their gifts
specifically for transfer to Ethiopia.
However, only funds derived from
the sale of $1 memberships may
be marked. Smaller amounts will
go to local and national chapters."
The Armistice Day appeal for sup
port will be observed in universities
throughout the country. Cahill is
supervising the Stanford drive in
co-operation with the Palo Alto
branch.
