i The Editor, Sir:
In Tuesday's Bull Session, Eisen-
I bach made the point quite clear, I
! think, that it is sheer idiocy to set
! a given speed lirr-it lor all drivers
! regardless of their ability.
If the law wishes to arrest all for
exceeding the limit, o.k., but give
j those who feel justified a chance to
j prove legally that they were not
j endangering society at the speed
I they were driving any more than
i many people who do not exceed the
: limit.
These tests should take into con
sideration skill in handling the ma
i chine, reaction speed, ability to
gpuge distances, no-accident record,
i etc. If the defendant passes the tests
i with a grade high enough to indi
j cate he was no more dangerous than
| the average at the speed limit, he
j should be released without fine or
; imprisonment.
