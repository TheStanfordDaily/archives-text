The Editor, Sir:
While Stanford is so intent on
1 reforming the athletic, the hymn !
I singing, and the smoking on the |
Quad situations, it might give a little
' attention to the management of the '■
| concerts. The conditions under !
' which Tito Schipa sang last Wed
! nesday were a disgrace to Stanford, j
It is bad enough that an artist is j
obliged to perform with a basket 1
! suspended over his head, in an at- j
I mosphere of steel beams, faded green |
j gunnysack, and on a soap-box-like ]
platform, without his being obliged j
l to wait several minutes after each j
number for the rude late-comers to j
find their seats.
j 1
Not just two or three stragglers j
were admitted, but droves of them ]
came clattering out on the main i
floor. Why Schipa did not leave the [
platform till the Big Parade was over !
is more than I can understand—j
perhaps because he was more of a
gentleman than those who came late, j
Certainly if we forbid late-comers (
from entering until the intermis- >
sions, we might convey the fact to !
them that they are attending a con- |
cert, not a dance. Can't we spare j
the artist and the majority of us who j

come on time the embarrassment of
interruptions by an inconsiderate
minority.
