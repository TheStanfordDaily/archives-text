# R.O.T.C. Gives Cold Facts, Low-Down on Ethiopia War
## 
### 
Latest type war planes and most
i modern of radio facilities will save
! Italian forces from a repetition of
I the 1896 Aduwa .slaughter by Ethio
pians in the present African struggle,
j n.O.T.C. authorities concede.
While they stand little chance of a
1 major defeat by warriors of Haile
! Selassie, Italians still find it hard to
make rapid headway into the Ethio
| pian interior even with latest type
j fighting equipment.
Ethiopians can thank their lucky
! stars for rugged mountains, jagged
clilTs, valley swamps, and mosqui
| toes. For these obstacles of nature,
not the tribesmen's military prow
ess. keep Italian forces from ad
| vnncing farther than they have
! today.
Armed with little more than
treacherous knives and lances as in
1896. Ethiopians are still rble to drift
] along in scattered groups, under
j cover of tropical underbrush or the
j dense Abyssinian night. Though a
few of the chieftains equip their men
with ancient rifles and a few modern
I automatics shipix'd in from Euro

, pean friends, it is mainly their ex
treme courage, love for themselves
and country, and hate for Italians,
that hold these native troops to
gether.
An example of Ethiopian disor
ganization is the distinction between
Ethiopia's cavalry and infantry. Ii
the warrior has a horse or mule of
his own, he is a cavalryman. Other
wise he remains in the native ras'
infantry.
If the Ethiopians' chief ally is
nature, the Italians' is science.
The criterion of modern fighting
equipment, the Italian army makes
important use of later type ob
servation planes. Pilots fly over
enemy territory, flash back by ra
dio to the nearest base reports of
I Ethiopian movements—if they can
locate the scattered, drifting blacks.
Unlikely to end soon, the war ap
parently has just begun. If and when
Mussolini's forces penetrate farthe •
toward Addis Ababa, Ethiopians
could in small groups move back of
the Italian front, cut off the Kom
nns' all-important supply and com
munication lines. If these line cuts

could be maintained, Ethiopians j
might win a series of i-mall battles
by guerilla warfare and hold up the
advance.
In any major engagement, how -
ever, Ilaile Selassie's warriors arc
licked before they start. In no de
cisive battle could a poorly
equipped, little-disciplined native
army stand up in the face of Italy's
super-strong war machine. Bomb
ing planes, fast-moving tanks, and
long-distance field guns would <
not be stopped by lances, sabers,
and a few out-moded rifles and
cannon. i
Able to subsist on one-tenth the
fond and water needed by white Ital- '
ian.s, black Ethiopians have no or
ganized supply system which Ital
ian bombers could cut off. Instead,
they stir up their meals ofT the
country, the wild plants and ani- I
mals. Strong, virile, used to the ex
treme climatic conditions, the proud
native warrior is a match for any
Italian fighter. But unlike the bat
tle in 189fi, armies, not individual
men. will decide the 1935 African
conflict.

Unlikely to end soon, the war ap

could in small groups move back of

might win a series of i-mall battles
by guerilla warfare and hold up the

In any major engagement, how -
ever, Ilaile Selassie's warriors arc

long-distance field guns would <

Able to subsist on one-tenth the

mals. Strong, virile, used to the ex
treme climatic conditions, the proud
native warrior is a match for any
