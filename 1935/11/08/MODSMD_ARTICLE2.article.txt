# Rushing Allowed This Week-end
## 
### 
That fraternities may carry on le
galized rushing this week-end in the
Los Angeles area was determined
at a late hour last night.
The InterfVaternity Board of Con
trol was called together for a tele
phone vote by Interfraternity Coun
cil President Ed Littlefield. Due to
the lack of time they were unable to
have a regular meeting. It was de
cided that since many arrangements
had already been made it was use
less to forbid rushing.
