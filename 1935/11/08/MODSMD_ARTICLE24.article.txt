# Sale of Big Game Rooters Tickets Closes Tomorrow
##

Students who wish to buy rooters'
tickets for the Big Game between
Stanford and California on Novem
ber 23 must do so before tomorrow
noon, according to B.A.C. officials.
The sale definitely will be closed at
that time and even those who go
south for the U.S.C. game will be
unable to purchase ducats after that
date. The tickets cost $1.65.
Approximately 1250 rooters' tick
ets have been sold but almost twice
that number must be sold before
the rooting section will be up to
the size of other years.
The additional ducats, of which
each student is allowed to buy four,
are also on sale at the B.A.C. office.
They cost $4.40. Fifteen hundred of
the general admission tickets were
sold Wednesday and an additional
two thousand were sold yesterday.
