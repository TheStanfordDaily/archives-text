# Spirited Rally Inspires Team
## Hoarse Students Escort Gridders to Train 
### 
Loyal Indian voices boomed out j
more than once in the Pavilion last '
night, loudly evidencing the fact that j
Farm spirit ran high at the Stanford- j
Southern California game pep rally.
Led by Yell King Dick Stark
and his assistants, Web Jones and
Talbot Shelton, rooters warmly
acclaimed each of the speakers
and entertainers.
Eames Bishop, president of Troy's j
student body, spoke highly of the j
campus pep, as he expressed the sen- i
timent of U.S.C. students —"may the I
best team win."
Wally Brooke, A.S.S.U. prexy,
lauded the gridiron representatives
of Troy and Stanford, concluding
with an expression of appreciation
of the rooters' support and en
thusiasm.
Stark then introduced Coach Tiny
Thornhill's Indian gridsters, who
were to board a train for the south
land an hour later.
After Cal) Callaway sang two
songs, Stark reviewed the past per
formances of the Cardinals against
the Trojan grid warriors. Briefly
he recounted the tale of seven
Stanford men who, as yearling
football hopes, vowed never to bow
to a Trojan onslaught. The same
seven Indians, he added, now first
stringers, won't easily relinquish
any opportunity,to carry out their
plans and make it "four straight
victories for the Indians" tomor
row.
Keith Topping, varsity end, lik
j ened the heat in last. Saturday's
rooting section to that c,i a "snow
man." For the team he expressed
the need of rooters' enthusiasm.
Bobby Grayson continued in the
same vein, after assuring the au
dience that the squad was "all fired
up and ready to go" and that it
should triumph if it played "the type
of football we're capable of playing.'
Mush Muller, former grid cap
tain, and Thornhill also sp<»ke.
Both were of the opinion that the
team's fire and drive, harked by
staunch rooters, would result in
fine prospects for Stanford tomor
row.
"Amateur Night"' included per
formances by tap-dancers, musicians,
and even a pair of corn-fed hill
billies.
With auto horns shrieking, enter
tainers, speakers, pajama-clad fresh
men and all, escorted Thornhill and
his gridsters to the Palo Alto rail
road depot where the team embarked
on its trip southward. As the train
rolled away from the Farm, horn.-,
bells, and took up the
clamor where hoarse throats left off.
Snakes arc able to digest the bones
and teeth of animals thev swallow.

Loyal Indian voices boomed out j
more than once in the Pavilion last '
