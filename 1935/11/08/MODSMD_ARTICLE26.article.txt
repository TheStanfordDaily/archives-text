# Team Off For U.S.C. Conflict
## Indians Say 'We Won't Lose'; Troy Waits for Siege Porky Cuneo, Bones Hamilton on Bench, But Rouble Will Play Old Position; Tiny Plans To Start Regular First Line 
### GORDY FROST 
Four years ago a team of Stanford frosh in their dressing-room just
I before the Papoose-Trohabe game vowed that they'd never lose to U.S.C.
The score: Stanford 33, U.S.C. 7.
Today, that same team with some exceptions, having kept their vow
and twice defeated the Trojan varsity, awaits the fourth and final meeting
with the football men of Troy. They still say: "We'll never lose to U.S.C."

> But the Trojan team this year,
though by no means the best they
have met, will be one of the tough
est. Coach Howard Jones and his
downtrodden band have been kicked
around the conference basement at
will thus far in the 1935 season. They
undoubtedly are anxious that such
proceedings end. They will cut loose
against Stanford tomorrow in a last
attempt to get out of the rut. They
will use everything.
But speeding southward on the
Lark last night was a Stanford team,

; though admittedly confident, deter
mined that its way should not be
i blocked.
Tiny Thornhill, originally plan-
I r.ing to take 36 men South, decided
\ last night to take one more. And
I thus "Porky" Cuneo makes the
jaunt, probably not to play because
lof an injury, but "because he's
i earned the trip," as Tiny put it.
Porky on Bench
Porky injured his ankle in the
; Washington game and though his
i improvement has been rapid, there
j is little chance that he will see ac
| tion tomorrow.
Tiny plans to start his regular
first line. Larry Rouble, also in
jured at Seattle, will he back at his
; guard job. It will be the same
| starting team Thornhill used at
Washington.
; Bones Hamilton, his bad muscle
