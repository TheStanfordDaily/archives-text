# Team Off For U.S.C. Conflict
## Indians Say 'We Won't Lose'; Troy Waits for Siege Porky Cuneo, Bones Hamilton on Bench, But Rouble Will Play Old Position; Tiny Plans To Start Regular First Line 
### GORDY FROST 
Four years ago a team of Stanford frosh in their dressing-room just
I before the Papoose-Trohabe game vowed that they'd never lose to U.S.C.
The score: Stanford 33, U.S.C. 7.
Today, that same team with some exceptions, having kept their vow
and twice defeated the Trojan varsity, awaits the fourth and final meeting
with the football men of Troy. They still say: "We'll never lose to U.S.C."

> But the Trojan team this year,
though by no means the best they
have met, will be one of the tough
est. Coach Howard Jones and his
downtrodden band have been kicked
around the conference basement at
will thus far in the 1935 season. They
undoubtedly are anxious that such
proceedings end. They will cut loose
against Stanford tomorrow in a last
attempt to get out of the rut. They
will use everything.
But speeding southward on the
Lark last night was a Stanford team,

; though admittedly confident, deter
mined that its way should not be
i blocked.
Tiny Thornhill, originally plan-
I r.ing to take 36 men South, decided
\ last night to take one more. And
I thus "Porky" Cuneo makes the
jaunt, probably not to play because
lof an injury, but "because he's
i earned the trip," as Tiny put it.
Porky on Bench
Porky injured his ankle in the
; Washington game and though his
i improvement has been rapid, there
j is little chance that he will see ac
| tion tomorrow.
Tiny plans to start his regular
first line. Larry Rouble, also in
jured at Seattle, will he back at his
; guard job. It will be the same
| starting team Thornhill used at
Washington.
; Bones Hamilton, his bad muscle
still not quite right, will have to be
contented with a bench position.
Doctors' orders will permit him to
play against Montana but not before.
At practice last night Bones ran
through plays in sweat clothes and
for the first time really put pressure
on the bad limb.
Tomorrow Stanford's line-up
will read as usual: Topping and
Moscrip, ends; Beedle and Rey
nolds, tackles; Rouble and Adams,
guards; Muller, center; Coffis and
Vigna, halfbacks; Paulman, quar
ter; Grayson, full.
And down South, head man Jones
is still planning ways and means to
upset the Stanford toboggan. He re
turned to the U.S.C. campus Monday
after watching Stanford play, "know
ing more about our team than we
do," as Tiny put it.
The Trojan boss told a U.S.C.
sports scribe Monday that '"Monk
Moscrip and Bobby Grayson are bet
ter than ever." And he went on to
say that "Stanford is the best of
fensive team I have seen yet this
year."
But Mr. Jones lias been doping
out an offense that will try the air
spaces over Los Angeles Coliseum
to match against Stanford. All
week be has been sending his
squad through pass plays. That's
bis apparent solution to the prob
lem of scoring on Stanford. #
And Mr. Thornhill has been doing
similar things, only from the other
point of view. Stanford has been
practicing pass defense against a
team of Trojans coached by Stan
ford's scout, Murray Cuddeback.
Stanford's new offense formation
has received most, of the remaining
attention. Tiny requested early last
week that no details of the new for
mation be mentioned in the press,
thus its absence from print.
But maybe by Saturday ove the
Trojan scribes will have something
pretty good to write about.
