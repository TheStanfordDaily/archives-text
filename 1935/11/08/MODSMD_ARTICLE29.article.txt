Fascist field guns frowned down
from the heights on Makale and

Messages curried by native run
ners through the heavy lines of
advance detachments and scout
ing patrols told how scattered reg
ulars of the Negus, returning to
Makale, had been received frig
idly by the populace, most of them
departing.
But their presence on the streets
of the objective city caused the high
staff of the Italian advance to take
every precaution. At headquarters,
officers explained yesterday's hand
to-hand encounter near Hauzien,
with casualties on both sides, meant
the Ethiopians were placing most of
their hope of success in filtering
back into ocupied territory.
Thus they could fall upon the
Italians from the flank and, if pos
sible, from the rear.
Aerial observers also reported
groups of the enemy marching be
lt ind Makale, and it was thought
likely scattered encounters might
occur as the Fascist advance guard
pushes on beyond Makale tomor
row.
There were reports from Addis
Ababa that an Ethiopian "death or
glory" squadron had entrenched
itself in Russian-built "pillboxes"
north of Makale, ready to die in
defease of the town, but a govern
ment spokesman there said the
northern Etliiopian commanders
were carrying out orders by slow
ly withdrawing, refusing' to fight
and "enticing" the enemy.
