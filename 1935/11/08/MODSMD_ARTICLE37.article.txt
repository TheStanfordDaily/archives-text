# Utilities Act Held Invalid In Entirety
## Federal Judges Rules Law Of No Effect In Biltmore Case 
### 
BALTIMORE, Nov. 7 (/P).—The
1935 Holding Company Act — de
signed to give the government power
for a sweeping reorganization of the
utility industry—today was held to
be invalid "in its entirety."
Federal District Judge William C.
Coleman ruled to that effect and in
those words in instructing the trus
tees of the American States Public
Service Company to treat the act as
"invalid and of no effect." Announce
ment in New York that an appeal
would be taken apparently headed
the case toward the Supreme Court
of the United States.
During hearings on the case,
John J. Burns, former Superior
Court judge of Massachusetts and
now chief counsel of the Securities
and Exchange Commission, filed a
brief in which he charged the three
parties—the litigants, Dr. Lauten
bach and Burco, Inc.—were acting in
collusion to obtain an opinion on
the constitutionality of the act.
He also charged that the same
utility interests which opposed the
act before Congress were furthering
| the case. Burns advised the court to
"proceed cautiously" in view of the
| "suspicious circumstances" sur
rounding the case.
