## Professor, Wife Attend Physiology Meet 
### Robert Wilcox 
Each delegate to the International
Congress of Physiology, held in Rus
sia last summer, could sit at his desk,
plug in a pair of ear phones, and
listen to an address in either Rus
sian, German, French, or English,
according to Dr. James Baumber
ger, associate professor of physiol
ogy. Expert translators instantly
transposed the words of the speaker
Into these four languages.
Professor and Mrs. Baumberger
have just returned from Moscow,
where Dr. Baumberger presented
a paper on research done by the
Stanford department of physiol
ogy, at the Fifteenth International
Congress of Physiology.
This congress, attended by about
fifteen hundred delegates from all
parts of the world, was the first
large scientific meeting held in Rus
sia since the World War, Professor
Baumberger stilted.
The congress was presided over
by the Russian scientist, Pavlov,
whose name is familiar every
where in connection with his work
on conditional reflexes, The So
viet government has provided Dr.
Pavlov with a well-equipped lab
oratory—with a large staff of as
sistants—where, in spite of his 85
years, he is still carrying on his
work, Professor Baumberger said.
Several hundred scientific papers
were presented at the congress, in
cluding five from Stanford. In ad
dition to the one prepared by Pro
fessor Baumberger and his staff
there were papers by Drs. Addis,
Cox, Cutting, and Jr-meson of the
Stanford Medical School, who also
attended the congress.
The warmth of the welcome
given to delegates to the congress
was an indication of the advance
ments that have been made in
Russia in the field of physiology,
Dr. Baumberger pointed out.
An extensive educational program
carried on by newspaper and radio
acquainted the Russian people with
the purposes and accomplishments
of physiologists in general, and of
some outstanding individuals in par
ticular.
The study of physiology in Rus
sia has become more widespread,
and (he number of physiological
laboratories has been increased
from 2-1 during the later years of
the ezarist regime, to 158 ft at the
present time.
Following the congress, Professor
and Mrs. Baumberger traveled in
the Soviet Union, visiting various
industrial centers and health re
sorts. Dr. Baumberger is now back
at his research, where, with the aid
of grants from the Rockefeller Foun
dation, he is developing new meth
ods of studying biological oxidations.

and (he number of physiological
laboratories has been increased
from 2-1 during the later years of
the ezarist regime, to 158 ft at the
present time.
Following the congress, Professor
and Mrs. Baumberger traveled in
the Soviet Union, visiting various
industrial centers and health re
sorts. Dr. Baumberger is now back
at his research, where, with the aid
of grants from the Rockefeller Foun
dation, he is developing new meth
ods of studying biological oxidations.
Each delegate to the International
Congress of Physiology, held in Rus
sia last summer, could sit at his desk,
plug in a pair of ear phones, and
listen to an address in either Rus
sian, German, French, or English,
according to Dr. James Baumber
ger, associate professor of physiol
ogy. Expert translators instantly
transposed the words of the speaker
Into these four languages.
Professor and Mrs. Baumberger
have just returned from Moscow,
where Dr. Baumberger presented
a paper on research done by the
Stanford department of physiol
ogy, at the Fifteenth International
Congress of Physiology.
This congress, attended by about
fifteen hundred delegates from all
parts of the world, was the first
large scientific meeting held in Rus
sia since the World War, Professor
Baumberger stilted.
The congress was presided over
by the Russian scientist, Pavlov,
whose name is familiar every
where in connection with his work
on conditional reflexes, The So
viet government has provided Dr.
Pavlov with a well-equipped lab
oratory—with a large staff of as
sistants—where, in spite of his 85
years, he is still carrying on his
work, Professor Baumberger said.
Several hundred scientific papers
were presented at the congress, in
cluding five from Stanford. In ad
dition to the one prepared by Pro
fessor Baumberger and his staff
there were papers by Drs. Addis,
Cox, Cutting, and Jr-meson of the
Stanford Medical School, who also
attended the congress.
The warmth of the welcome
given to delegates to the congress
was an indication of the advance
ments that have been made in
Russia in the field of physiology,
Dr. Baumberger pointed out.
An extensive educational program
carried on by newspaper and radio
acquainted the Russian people with
the purposes and accomplishments
of physiologists in general, and of
some outstanding individuals in par
ticular.
The study of physiology in Rus
sia has become more widespread,
and (he number of physiological
laboratories has been increased
from 2-1 during the later years of
the ezarist regime, to 158 ft at the
present time.
