# 'Lord Beeglesfoot' Will Star in Gaieties Skit
## 
### 
According to announcement from
Gaieties Director Frank O'Neill, the
latest addition to the lengthy list of
famous people writing for the Gaie
ties is a renowned movie feature
scenarist who has painstakingly
turned out a skit to be presented
on our humble stage.
This great drama takes place en
tirely under water, including sound
effects and a rumor that Weaver is
therein drowned, and includes a
tremendous cast of 2,800 thespians.
The plot unwinds in 94 acts, and
utilizes every famous man in history
including Mickey Mouse. The title
of this masterpiece is "Lord Beegles
foot and Hi.s Wire-Haired Wombats."
The play has met with great suc
cess, especially in London where
the performance began in 175 G. It
is still going on, but will be ended
in time to be shown here, it is hoped.
However, since this melodramatic
burlesque is not enough to fill the
program, other skits will be inserted.
The S.A.E.'s have come forth with
a very excellent sketch which prom
ises to be the hit of the evening.
Good acts have also been turned in
by both Lagunita and Union.
"In regard to the music," an
nounces the daffy-drownee Weaver,
"I have nothing to say, for I am deaf.
