new "Philippine Clipper," second of
three 25-ton flying boats built in
Baltimore for Pan-American Air

Florida next week and thence to
California.
The new clipper completed its first
flight yesterday over Chesapeake

in the first of a series of tests, which
officials said she performed "splen

The Philippine Clipper is a "twin"
of the China Clipper which was
turned over to Pan-American re

California-Orient run. Tests will
continue for a week or more.
The China Clipper, which will in

groomed in Miami for the flight to
the Pacific Coast which will begin
Friday morning. The first mail
carrying trans-Pacific flight will
carry the China Clipper to Pan-
American bases at Hawaii, Midway,
Wake, and Guam Islands, and Ma
