# Key Through As Fullback For U.C.L.A.
## Dean Investigates Family Tree, Rules Ted Has Played Too Long 
### 
AMARILLO, Tex., Nov. 7 (/P).—
Mysterious Ted Key, of the Texas
Keys, tonight 4iad apparently done
his last bit of fullbacking for the
University of California at Los An
geles Brums.
Still not certain whether the R. F.
(Ted) Key at U.C.L.A. is the man
he says he is, or his brother, Clois
(Sharty) Key, Dean E. R. Miller
of the coast school, head sleuth in
the "family tree" investigation, was
certain of one thing anyway:
The Ted Key at U.C.L.A. can turn
in uniform No. 35.
"Upon my return to California
I will recommend that Key he
withheld from further football
competition — unless additional
evidence is uncovered."
Miller said he would continue to
browse around among the branches
of the Key family tree in an effort to
learn once and for all if the fullback
is R. F. (Honest I'm Ted) Key or
Clois (Shorty) Key, a brother of
Ted.
The "Shorty" Key was some
shakes as a fullback for the Texas
School of Mines at El Paso several
years hack, and if their fullback
is the same man, U.C.L.A. officials
say they want no more of him. He
would he ineligible because of an
extended college pigskin "course."
"In view of the evidence I have
found so far," said Miller, "I am
convinced that our Ted Key is in
eligible, but I want to find out
everything I can about this case be
fore I return to Los Angeles."
He had his pockets crammed with
contradictory statements—-some say
ing Ted was Ted and others saying
just as positively that Ted was
Shortv.
