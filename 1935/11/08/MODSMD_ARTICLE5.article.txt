# Lagunita Maidens Add Photographs To Rogues Gallery
## 
### 
"154," "155," "156." Young
ladies, hardly criminal looking
but each tagged with large,
black cardboard numbers, were
yesterday lined up in a rustic,
prison-like room of the Old
Roble Gym. One after another
they marched in front of a
treacherous - looking camera,
were unceremoniously snapped
by photographer.
One what charge the women
had been nabbed, numbered,
photographed apparently for a
rogue's gallery, was not readily
discernable. Some might con
sider them tough enough.
Curious hangers - around,
however, soon identified the
stern "warden" as Quad Head
man Don Hanson, the "ma
tron's" charges as Lagunita's
innocent maidens, and the
"rogue's gallery" as the 1936
Quad.
