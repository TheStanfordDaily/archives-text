# Farm Looks To Win Over U.S. C. Tomorrow
## 'Beat Trojans, Forget Losses' Rooters Urge Early Season Difficulties Recalled in Interviews 
### Art Stokes 
"Beat the Trojans? Sure, but don't
worry about wiping out past de
feats."
Thus most Stanford students, re
membering the Indians' troubles
with Washington and Santa Clara,
yesterday indicated they will be
ready to forgive and forget if the
Big Red Machine beats the once
Thundering Herd by one point in
tomorrow's grid contest.
U.S.C. lias Chance
Most of them, too, seem to agree
with San Francisco sports writers
that, while the Indians are favored,
U.S.C. i.s not so weak that it has no
chance to win.
Such scoring as would be needed
to erase the infamous 41-12 defeat
of 1930 can be used to better advan
tage against the Golden Bears two
weeks hence, Stanford fans reason.
So, unlike Cal, which wanted to
avenge a 74-0 lacing by the U.S.C.
gridders of the boom days, Stanford
ites only ask for victory tomorrow —
though a few would like to see a
one-sided game. Some of the com
ment on the battle follows:
WALLACE BROOKE, A.S.S.U.
president After seeing the way the
boys had to light against Santa Clara
and Washington, I'll be glad to see
them play good football tomorrow—
play it like they meant it and not
taking any chantvs on injuries. Let's
save the scoring for Cal.
PHIL COGIILAN, Rally Commit
tee chairman If we take them—and
everyone's "hot" for it—we'll be all
set to £o against Cal. I don't care
if we beat S.C. by one point or 50.
We've got to beat the Trojans, but
we want Cal!
WILLIAM ROCKWELL, Sequoia
Club president—l'm not especially
interested in seeing the 1930 score
wiped out. Of course, I'd like to see
Stanford win, but there's no use
beating the pants off the Trojans.
DEAN MARY YOST — I don't
know anything about football, but
of course I want our boys to win.
LI) LITTLEFIELD, chairman of
the Interfratemity Board of Control
-Certainly I'd like to see the In
dians avenge 1930. I think they have
a pretty good chance—not to beat
them that badly- but to give the
Trojans a pretty good licking.
I'EGGY SCIIAEFER, chairman of
Women's Council Of course, I'll be
glad to see us win by a really largo
score. I'd like to see a decisive
score because we're so low in con
ference standings we need it.
DEAN GEORGE CULVER—Any
kind of win will suit me. and of
course there's always a chance of an
upset by U.S.C. I saw the first Stan
ford win ;>t Los Angeles and got all
the kick I want out of those games
then.
DICIv STAKK, yell leader and
Cardinal chairman — I think I'm
more interested in the outcome of
the sophomore vow not to lose to
U.S.C. I think that's more pertinent
now in the sophomores' last year.
