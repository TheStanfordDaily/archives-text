# Radio Hour To Feature Sears
## Schools and Depression To Be Subject of Talk 
### 
Professor Jesse B. Sears, of the
.School of Education, will discuss
! "Getting the Schools out of the De
| pression" on the Stanford Radio
j Hour from Station KGO al 8 o'clock
| Monday night. He will advance
plans for making education avail
[ able to every child by pooling the
| cost of modern schools and distrib
; uting it evenly throughout the
j country.
By enlarging adult educational
i facilities, modernizing schools every
| where, and paying teachers suffi
; eient salary to insure a healthy men-
I tal attitude, Professor Sears believes
I the nation's schools can help adjust
| the country to circumstances brought
! on during the past few years.
1 These circumstances are the re
isult of financial pressure which has
! disrupted the school programs at a
I time when education was most
I needed for adjustment to new social
conditions.
