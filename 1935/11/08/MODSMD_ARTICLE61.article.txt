# Coach Howard Jones' Record Unique Guiding Great Teams
## 
### John Rice 
Two hundred and twenty games
played, 47 lost —that i.s the enviable
record of all grid teams coached by
Howard Harding Jones, football men
tor of U.S.C. During 24 years of
coaching six different colleges, ono
year at Syracuse, two at Yale, one
c<,.» v

at Ohio State,
one at Duke
University, eight
at lowa, and 11
at U.S.C. Jones
teams have only
once lost more
games than they
won in a given
season. This
took place at
Duke in 1924
when they em
erged from the
season with four
'wins and five
defeats.

Since he has been coach of U.S.C.
the Trojans have played S!) times
and lost only 1!>. Under the tute
lage of Jones, who is still acknowl
edged to he one of the wisest
coaches in the game, 19 all-Aineri
can gridmen have been developed
This record of the veteran, aqui
line featured old coach is unsur
passed iu gridiron history.
Jones himself played all-Amer
ican football while he was at Yale.
For three years, from 1905 to 1908,
he starred from his position at left
end. Besides this, he was pitcher of
the Yale baseball varsity which was
undefeated during the two seasons
that he was on il. At fifty, Jones is
still a good athlete seldom does he
play 18 holes of golf that his .score
exceeds 80.
Although he seldom shows ex
citement during games, his poker
face complex must have; been given
some tremendous jolts during his
U ng coaching career. In 1909, a year
after his graduation, his Yale team,
which contained six all-Americans,
remained undefeated during the
whole season. Again in 1921 he
coached an lowa team that not only

suffered no losses, but also ended
the two-year winning streak of the
Notre Dame "Fightin" Irish."
Bob Ray, in his column "Sports X
Ray" in the Los Angeles Times, sa\ s.
in regard to Jones' policy of contin
ually changing the varsity line-up
around in an attempt to find the most
powerful combination:

"K does seem queer that after
six months of practice Jones does
not yet know who are his best
players. Mr. Jones, don't you think
it would be easier to mould 11
players into something near a
smooth running machine than it
won!:! to do the same stunt with a
couple of dozen?"
