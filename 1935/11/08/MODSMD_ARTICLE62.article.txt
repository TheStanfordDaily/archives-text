# Cal-S.C. Battle About Mistake Going Strong
## 
### 
Further explanations of the
squabble between U.C. and U.S.C.
papers over reporting oi the "bad
blood" charges made against Bobby
Grayson and Frank Alustiza by Art
Cohn, Long Beach columnist, were
carried in the Daily Californian.
In a feature column, the paper ex
plained its wire service did not carry
the original story and said a report
er rewrote it from a Bay paper.
Donald C. Ralston, the California
columnist, added in his explanation:
"The fact that we made a mistake
should be mourned within the
fourth estate, rather than misinter
preted and shouted from Los Ange
les to Berkeley."
Trouble started when the Califor
nian attributed the "bad blood"
story to the Trojan. Tom Lawless,
Daily Trojan editor, immediately
wrote an open letter to Henry
Schacht, Californian editor, demand
ing an apology for "gross misstate
ment of facts" and suggested "mali
cious intent on the part of at least
one member of your staff."
