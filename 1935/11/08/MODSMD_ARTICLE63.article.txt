# Droffie Says Indian'll Bust Troy Balloon
## 
### 
Sylvestre Joseph Drofnats, prophet
and 10.5.s to discriminating football
scores, had this to say yesterday
about tomorrow's bodily contact of
a public but infernal nature with
the Troy balloons: "We can win, :1
we fight hard."
"Just to be different, I'm predict
ing the same score for Stanford that
I did last week, 17-6, with Stanford
to show," said the seer, who denies
privately that he is a seersucker.
Because the Cal frosh are so darn
sure they can clean the Stanford
yearlings, the heavy medium fig
ures that the Stanford kiddies will
clean and press them, 7-6.
Though there? may be doubts in
some quarters, the dopey dopester
predicts California will take Wash
ington 7-7. A tic , Droffie points out,
would be a great gift to Stanford,
and most gift ties have to be taken
back to tin l store, anyway.
Otherwise, everything is the sam"
as before: W.S.C. 21. Idaho 6; Mon
tana 7, Gonzaga 6; Oregon State 14,
Oregon 0: Southern Methodist 10,
U.CL.A, 7: St. Mary's 7, Fordham 0;
Utah 14, Colorado 0.
