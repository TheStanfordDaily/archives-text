# Water Poloists To Meet Bruins, Trojans In L.A.
## Indians Seek To Win Back League Lead Indian Line-up Revised By Coach Thornton For Hard Tilts 
### Herb Diamond 
Attempting to wrest Coast water
polo supremacy from the grip of
U.C.L.A., Stanford's varsity tank
squad will clash with the mighty
Bruins at Westwood this afternoon at
4:30 o'clock.
Coach Nort Thornton last night
herded his revised Indian line-up
into a train bound for the southland
where it is to face crucial tests
against the Uclans today and the
Trojans tomorrow afternoon. Since '
the California tilt several weeks ago,
which ended in their only defeat of
the season, the Cardinals have ex
hibited an entirely different offense
and a much improved brand of water
polo.
Cards Improve
Stanford overwhelmed U.S.C. to
the tune of 13-2 and, within another
I week, downed the Olympic Club j
; twice in succession, 3-2 and 8-5.
Against the same opponents the
I Bears have made less impressive
performances. They defeated the
I Trojans twice, by six and five
point margins respectively, and
! then eked out a 0-5 win over the
I Winged 'O' outfit.
The Bruins are bolstered by the 1
i same power this year that threatened
I Stanford last season, when a single
| goal gave the latter squad wins tin
two occasions. Among the Westwood
' standouts are Mel Sellers, all-con
ference sprint; Ed Knox, all-Confer -
! ence guard; Richard Daubenspeck,
| ace guard; and Dixon Fiske, for
i ward.
U.C.L.A.'s Jinx
Just one fact serves to tave off any
' overconfidence on the part of
U.C.L.A.—they have, never beaten
Stanford at water polo. Each of the
four games that the two schools have
played ended up with the Indians one
point better than the Bruins.
That today's tussle in West
j wood will be rough and tough,
then, is of little doubt. The Cardi
nals will pit a flashy Hungarian
; offensive—fast break, short pass
j ing, and all—against the effective
American system, which includes
long passing and a fast tip shot.
The Indians have swept every op
ponent aside since they adopted
their improved tactics after the
; California battle.
Stanford is a heavy favorite to
repeat the 13-2 drubbing they hand
, ed U.S.C. two weeks ago, when they
meet Troy tomorrow for a return
| match. Coach Fred Cady's tankmen
were completely baffled by the Card
inal attack in the first game, but
: since then they have polished up
their defense to no small degree,
i And, for this reason, they will un
doubtedly make the going much
tougher for the Indians.
| The following line-up will see ac
tion in both week-end tussles: Co
captains Wally Wiget and Bill Wood
ard, guard and sprint, respectively;
Bill Clsmo, guard; Bob Hoover,
guard; "Suds" Sutherland, forward;
i Chuck Giffin, forward; Don Peter
son, guard; Bob Haslacher, goalie;
and Ben Voss, centerback.
At the end of the first half of 1935,
22 companies operating on domestic
1 routes, and four offering service to
foreign nations, were operating 4(34
> planes.

j ing, and all—against the effective
American system, which includes
long passing and a fast tip shot.
The Indians have swept every op
ponent aside since they adopted
their improved tactics after the
; California battle.
Stanford is a heavy favorite to
repeat the 13-2 drubbing they hand
, ed U.S.C. two weeks ago, when they
meet Troy tomorrow for a return
| match. Coach Fred Cady's tankmen
were completely baffled by the Card
inal attack in the first game, but
: since then they have polished up
their defense to no small degree,
i And, for this reason, they will un
doubtedly make the going much
tougher for the Indians.
| The following line-up will see ac
tion in both week-end tussles: Co
captains Wally Wiget and Bill Wood
ard, guard and sprint, respectively;
Bill Clsmo, guard; Bob Hoover,
guard; "Suds" Sutherland, forward;
i Chuck Giffin, forward; Don Peter
son, guard; Bob Haslacher, goalie;
and Ben Voss, centerback.

Attempting to wrest Coast water
polo supremacy from the grip of
U.C.L.A., Stanford's varsity tank
squad will clash with the mighty
Bruins at Westwood this afternoon at
4:30 o'clock.
Coach Nort Thornton last night
herded his revised Indian line-up
into a train bound for the southland
where it is to face crucial tests
against the Uclans today and the
Trojans tomorrow afternoon. Since '
the California tilt several weeks ago,
which ended in their only defeat of
the season, the Cardinals have ex
hibited an entirely different offense
and a much improved brand of water
polo.
Cards Improve
Stanford overwhelmed U.S.C. to
the tune of 13-2 and, within another
I week, downed the Olympic Club j
; twice in succession, 3-2 and 8-5.
Against the same opponents the
I Bears have made less impressive
performances. They defeated the
I Trojans twice, by six and five
point margins respectively, and
! then eked out a 0-5 win over the
I Winged 'O' outfit.
The Bruins are bolstered by the 1
i same power this year that threatened
I Stanford last season, when a single
| goal gave the latter squad wins tin
two occasions. Among the Westwood
' standouts are Mel Sellers, all-con
ference sprint; Ed Knox, all-Confer -
! ence guard; Richard Daubenspeck,
| ace guard; and Dixon Fiske, for
i ward.
U.C.L.A.'s Jinx
Just one fact serves to tave off any
' overconfidence on the part of
U.C.L.A.—they have, never beaten
Stanford at water polo. Each of the
four games that the two schools have
played ended up with the Indians one
point better than the Bruins.
That today's tussle in West
j wood will be rough and tough,
then, is of little doubt. The Cardi
nals will pit a flashy Hungarian
; offensive—fast break, short pass
j ing, and all—against the effective
American system, which includes
