# S.C. Has Edge In Past Games
## 
### 
If statistics of past encounters are
to be figured when predicting the
Stanford-Southern California tussle
in the Coliseum tomorrow, the edge
will be with the Trojans. Only three
; times since 1926 have the Indians
emerged victorious.
Since Tiny Thornhill's coming,
i however, a decided trend toward
Stanford supremacy has been evi
denced. The first of these victories
came in 1933 when Thornhill's soph
omores upset the highly touted S.C.
team.
Scores of games since 1926 are as
I follows:
1926 13-12 Stanford
[ 1927 13-13 Tie
1928 10-0 S.C.
1929 7-0 S.C.
1930 41-12 S.C.
1931 19-0 S.C.
1932 13-0 S.C.
1933 13-7 Stanford
1934 16-0 Stanford
The gunboat, Charleston, to be
launched at the Charleston navy
yard in December, will be the third
ship of the United States navy to
bear the name of Charleston.
