# Frosh Set for Little Big Game Tomorrow
## 'Wonder Team' of U.C. Cubs Faces Papoose Gridders California Eleven Favored To Defeat Stanford First-Year Men in Annual Contest 
### ROGER KIMBALL 
"If you guys- play the way you can, Cal won't score a touchdown on
you in teg years of trying." So spoke Coach Jimmy Bradshuw to his
Stanford freshman football team yesterday in the semifinal practice before
the Little Big Game with the Bear Cubs at 2 o'clock tomorrow afternoon
in the Stadium.

Defense was the subject of yes- i
terday's workout, as the regulars
drilled on stopping passes and
runs by the third string. Assistant
Coach John Bunn was the reserve
"captain," and did most of the
passing and hall-carrying. The
practice was light, with tackles
made by tagging. Today's session
may be even lighter,
Pete Zagar, who cut his left hand
in the chemistry lab Wednesday,
took a workout yesterday, and
should be at his best for the Califor
nia frosh. Byron West has seen
much service recently at tackle, and
could replace either Zagar or Dave
Carnahan tomorrow without weak
ening the line-up noticeably.
Right end is uncertain, as Andy
Stojkovich was hack in his old
position yesterday, and Irv Cum
mings on the sidelines. Cunnnings
played the position in practice
Wednesday. Either may start to
morrow, and both are almost cer
tain to play. Walt Hegc and Don
Butler both worked on the other
flank.
Bill Carew, fast substitute half
back, whose nose was broken last
week, worked out with a special
helmet last night, and may play to
morrow. For the first time in several
weeks, the yearlings are at full
strength, with all injured men re
covered.
Stsuiford will probably need all
the man-power it can muster to
morrow, since the Bear Cubs, with
a fast, tricky team, will be decided
favorites. In their 13-6 victory
over the Trojan frosh last Satur
day, the Blue and Gold Thirty
nincrs continued to exercise their
season habit of placing alert,
heads-up ball, taking advantage
of every break.
Apparently outplayed by the S.C.
babes in every department of the
game, the present California frosh
have earned the title of "wonder
team." Everybody wonders how they
win games. They are dangerous at
all times, and take special delight
in intercepting the opposition's
passes and running them back to
touchdowns. San Mateo Junior
College's aerial attack boomeranged
to the extent of a 20-0 defeat by the
Cubs.
Comparative scores give a big
edge to California tomorrow, since
Stanford defeated the San Mateo
Jaysee by only a 9 to 0 margin, and
lost to the Trobabes, 19 to 7. The
Indian yearlings' main problems
tomorrow will be to break up the
accurate passing of California's
Vic Bottari, especially his tosses
to Right End Ned Thomas, and
to stop *thc powerful line smash
ing of Lucius "Lute" Ades, Bear
fullback.
If Bradshaw's men can succeed in
these defensive functions, and if they
can break Pete Fay or Bill Kirsch
loose behind Ed Garnier's blocking,
or open holes for Captain Wally
deWitt, or if deWitt can complete
one of his southpaw tosses to Fay,
Cummings, or Hege in the clear,
there may be another upset in the
Stadium tomorrow.
Probable line-ups, subject to
change, are as follows:
California frosh — Ends, Schlei
baum and Thomas; tackles, deVero
na and Stoll; guards, Ray and Stone;
center, Collier; quarterback, Winter
bottom; halfbacks, Bottari and Fir
po; fullback, Ades.
Stanford frosh—Ends, Cummings
and Hege; tackles, Zagar and Car
nahan; guards, McMillan and
Shreve; center, Sutton; quarterback,
Gamier; halfbacks, Kirsch and Fay;
lullback, deWitt (C).
