# Veterans, New Blood Bolster Baseball Team
## Thirty Prospects Report For Fall Workouts 
### 
Coach Harry Wolter has very good
reason to believe that his 1936 var
sity baseball nine will be one of the
best turned out at Stanford in recent
times when he surveys the fall
squad.
Although many men are still
competing in fall sports and others
have not reported yet, approximately
30 players have already checked out
suits for practice this quarter, in
cluding a large number of veterans
from last year's team.
The main positions to be filled by
newcomers this year are on the
mound left vacant by the graduation
of Fred Herringer and Stan Ander
son, last year's co-captains, Gordv
Mallatratt's first-base post, and Ted
Leidig's outfield spot.
Veterans Back
Veterans of last year's squad al
ready in suits include Al Brent,
Darrel Holman and Tim McClure,
outfielders; Frank Tremain, Horace
Blackman and George Ferris, in
fielders; Mike Ferro and Bill Her
ringer, catchers. Several more, in
cluding Bones Hamilton, outfielder
and captain of the team, are expected
to report next quarter.
Transfers who show promise of
breaking into the line-up are Verne
Johnson from Menlo J.C., outfielder
and pitcher; Ray Weierhauser of
Modesto J.C., third baseman and
pitcher; George Farrell, Menlo,
shortstop; Leo Hagerty, San Mateo
J.C., catcher; Frank Dane of Fuller
ton J.C., outfielder; and Richard Tarn
from the University of Hawaii, sec
ond baseman.
Up From Frosh
Sophomore prospects are William
Bengel, second baseman, Tom Kil
lefer, pitcher and first baseman, Jack
Huddleston, third baseman, and
Dale Reimer, shortstop.
Negotiations are under way by
Wolter and Senior Manager Art
Allen to arrange a meeting with
Coach Otto Kluni of the University
of Hawaii regarding proposed games
between Stanford and Hawaii if the
Stanford team makes a trip to the
Far East next summer.
