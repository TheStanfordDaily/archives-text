THIS WOULD
PLEASE STANFORD
A perfect Stanford week-end:
Stanford to defeat U.S.C.
Washington and California to lie.
Southern Methodist to defeat
U.C.L.A.
Yep, if it should work out that
way the red toboggan would be
given a shove that would carry it
mighty near to the Rose Bowl.
The first one—Stanford over
U.S.C.—is fairly probable. It's a
fact that EI Trojan will put out his
absolute best in an effort to stop
the toboggan but Stanford's slide
is well under way; the Howard
Jones men will have plenty of
trouble halting it.
It's also a fact that Stanford is too
sure of the above fact, and for that
reason S.C. is in a perfect spot for an
upset. However, possibility of upset
included, it's a good bet that No. 1
will become fact.
But this Washington-California
affair is different. This scribe picks
the Huskies after watching them
rip and tear at the Stanford In
dian. However, from the Farm
point of view a Washington wiit_
might be disastrous to Rose Bowl
hopes.
So with that in mind we pull for
a Bear victory. Then the Indian
would have a chance to dispute the
point in the annual Big Game.
But the perfect outcome —Cal and
Washington to tie. Then both would
have slipped down the ladder just a
half rung below Stanford, and the
Uclan defeat would lose almost all
its sting. But in that instance the
Big Game would still settle the Bear
, Indian issue of supremacy.
S.M.U. IS NO
WEAK SISTER
No. 3—Southern Methodist to de
feat U.C.L.A. Impossible? Not. by
any means. This year S.M.U. has one
of the finest teams in the country
and in seasons past they've given
demonstrations of mighty good foot
ball playing.
Last year they defeated Ford
hani, Washington, and Arkansas,
tied Louisiana and U. of Texas. So
far in their 1935 season they've run
up lh'6 points in seven games to
opponents' 18.
Those Dallas Mustangs are noted
for a style of aerial attack that's apt
j to lay any opponent low, and when
the Uclans meet these S.M.U. gents
j tomorrow, you can bet your bottom
I dollar that it will be a good battle.
If the Bruins should be upset it
| could not help but please Stanford
greatly. For Bill Spalding's West
wood lads are still determined that

they belong in the Rose Bowl an:l
tv/o defeats would very definitely end
that hope.
BRONCS WERE
AFTER THE BALL
Stanford-Santa Clara game pic
tures jjhown to the team Wednesday
night brought out one fact about
that game which might have been
previously overlooljed—those Brones
were out to block kicks at any cost.
When Bill Pauhnan dropped
back to boot, two of the Bronco
secondaries would take posts just
behind the left side of the line,
opposite Stanford's right.
,As the ball was snapped the Santa
Clara linemen would try to flatten
Stanford's guard and tackle and at
the same time the two backs would
take a two- or three-yard run, and
then hurdle over the mess of tied up
linemen.
They got that far all right but
Stanford's halves would either drop
them on the way or Bill would get
the kick off before they reached him.
At any rate, they had to rob
their safety man of most of his
interference to send those backs in.
and though their blocking efforts
failed, several shots showed tlieni
ton close for comfort.
One blocked kick by those "run
and jump over" forces, and Stan
ford might not still be only once
defeated. —Frost
