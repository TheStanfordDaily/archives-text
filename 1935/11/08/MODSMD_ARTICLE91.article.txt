# Shearer Home To Face Theft Charge
## 
### 
SACRAMENTO. Nov. 7 (A*).â€”
William B. Shearer came back to
his home today to face a charge of
grand theft, still clinging to his
statement that "I assume responsi
bility" for a shortage of $24,813 in
the State Treasury, where he
worked for 13 years as cashier.
He stepped down from a train on
which he had ridden since Monday
from Fort Worth, Texas, into the
bright morning sunshine and gazed
with bewilderment at a small crowd
of police, reporters, photographers,
and a few curious spectators.
