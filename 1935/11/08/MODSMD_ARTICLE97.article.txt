### 
What is it going to he when one thousand f
four hundred fifty-odd students go south this
week-end? The Great Migration or The Great
Excuse? No one seems to be in a fever pitch
or pulling at the bit to hurry down and cheer
the Stanford team to a victory over the Trojan ,
host. On the contrary most everyone seems j
to look for another pushover the same way 1
they expected the Santa Clara game to be a j
breeze.
The I'.S.C. game, consequently, presents t
an opportunity for great numbers of students
to whip down to the big city via train and
automobile, go hog-wild for a couple of days,
and then return to nurse splitting headaches
before they can gel back into the old routine.
This indifferent attitude leads to the con
clusion that, i! pressed to the point, a majority
of these week-end travelers would be forced
to admit that the game is only an excuse to
get away for a week-end of horseplay. This
game with Troy, however, is important to the
team. Stanford's chances depend on it.
Stanford's win over Washington demon- 1
strated what student backing of the team can
do. In the same way a let-down on the part
of that backing can mean a let-down in the
team and result in a loss. Stanford wants to
play in the Hose Howl. Only consistent sup
port from the students can get the team there.
