# And Stanford Keeps Her Fingers Crossed
## 
### 
Following tlic news thai I lie first six weeks
of autumn quarter at Stanford have passed
without ;i single injury Iroin an automobile
aceidenl eomes information Horn the Uni
versity of California that William Collins, a
student, died Wednesday idler ail aeiedent
en route to Berkeley after last week's Cali
fornia-! '.C.L.A. game.
Stanford students, apparently eoneerning
themselves over the startling annual toll auto
crashes are taking, have begun to take it
easy with their campus driving, (Jordy Davis,
campus officer, optimistically comments.
The Farm driving public's two mass move
ments, however, are to be reckoned with be
fore this quarter's perfect record is complete.
The first, a lour to Los Angeles this week-end,
might easily produce a fatality such as that
which marred California's victory march from
Los Angeles to Berkeley. The second danger
spot in the autumn driving season is the even
more perilous Big Came night.
Cordv Davis will be able to point with pride
lo Stanford's traffic situation â€” when the
F.S.C. migration and Big Came "rat-race"
have been passed without mishap. In the
meantime, Stanford knocks on wood.
