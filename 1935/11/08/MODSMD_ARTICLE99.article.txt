# Politics and Amateur Sport Do Not Mix

### 
While proponents of an American boycott
of the HM(> Olympics have begun Hooding the
country with mimeographed reports of "evi
dence of Nazi discrimination against .lews,"
word comes from another leader of matters
Olympic which indicates Germany's prepara
tions all are above-hoard.
Gount Henri Maillct-Latour, president of the
International Olympic Committee, claims
"the 1.0.C. has most painstakingly gone over
the entire situation ayd linds Germany in
every way living up to Olympic rules."
Speaking of the American campaign
against Germany, the French sports head
added, "We can disregard it, because it is
based on misstatement and many lies. I'nder
those circumstances, the international com
mittee has neither right nor reason to object
to the games being held in Merlin."
Gount Haillet-Latour's point that the boy

cott campaign has been conducted for politi
cal and unsporting motives is well taken. The
tendency on the part of many Americans to
dahhle in foreign religious questions seem
ingly oversteps the hounds when a protest
takes the form of an attempt to mix religion
and politics with as clean a type of amateur
sport as the Olympic (lames represent.
