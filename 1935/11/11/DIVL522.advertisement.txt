By sending THE DAILY home, that's where you can have your
whole family for only $1.50 a quarter. It's a terrific burden to write
"newsy" letters regularly to every member of the family. When
you send The Daily home you send all the news to the whole fam
ily at once . . . and they learn more about what's happening at
Stanford than if you spent all your time writing letters.
I Phone 4717 and THE STANFORD DAILY will send the paper I
home: and, if you wish, the bill will be sent home, too.
YOUR WHOLE FAMILY ENJOYS READING I
The Stanford Daily
