# 'Support Sanctions of League,' Say Stuart
## 
### 
Belief that the United States
.should support the League of Na
tion's sanctions without forcing it
to institute a blockade, has been ex
pressed by Professor Graham Stuart,
of the political science department.
"Let us support the League,"
said Professor Stuart, "by com
pelling our commercial interests to
forego the profits of trade with
Italy and tluis not force tlie League
to impose a blockade, which
would seem to mean war with
Italy."
According to Professor Stuart,
Germany's recent decision to uphold
the League's sanctions leaves the
question of selling necessary mate
rial of war to Italy up to America.
Although America has already is
sued a neutrality act it has failed to
specify whether oil. steel, and coal,
which are vital to modern warfare,
are implements of war.
"If the powers outside the
League—Brazil, Japan, and the
United States—continue to sell
goods of military value to Italy,
cither the League must prevent
such traffic by force or the cco

nomic embargo /ails," 1 Pro
fessor Stuart. "Therefore, il seems
to me Chat the League must either
get neutral support l»£ persuasion
or force."
Professor Stuart things that if
Italy should be unable tosget food,
oil, steel, and coal from« outside
sources she would be unable\to con
tinue the Italo-Ethiopian war for
more than six months. If a blockade
was instituted preventing Italy tfrom
getting war materials from outside
sources she might declare war, on
European powers, which would * be
disastrous as far as Italy is con
cerned. \
"Mussolini, being in power, wouM
rather pull Italy into utter destruc
tion than relinquish his power,"
clared Professor Stuart.
The possibility that such an ac'<-
might be the spark that would 'ig
nite another World War ,md ven
tually draw America into it v en
by Professor Stuart.
He said, "As it is extm difTi
cult to isolate war, I fov at the
safer way for us t<> kv. , J being
drawn in is to prevent war from
breaking out."
