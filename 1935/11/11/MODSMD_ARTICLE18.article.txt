# Elections In East Called Insignificant
## Professor Cottrell Says Results Are Indicative Of Normal Trend 
### 
"The results of the recent eastern
selections signify just what the Re
publicans and Democrats want them
to signify," declared Professor Ed
win A. Cottrell, of the political sci
ence department, in an interview
Friday.
Comparing the optimistic state
ments of the two largest national
political parties to "shouting down
a rainharrel," Professor Cottrell
said that election results only indi
cate a return to normalcy.
Explaining that the Republican
majority in the New York Assembly
and the Philadelphia mayoralty elec
tions were the expected outcome up
until the "great Democratic land
slide" and that Kentucky has always
had a Democratic governor, Pro
fessor Cottrell said that the eastern
elections gave no indication as to the
Democratic chances in the 1936 pres
idential elections.
When asked his opinion con
cerning the eastern elections Pro
fessor Thomas Bailey, of the his
tory department, said, "It has been
evident for some time that the pop
ularity of the New Deal has been
decreasing."
The results of recent elections in
the East seem to bear out what we
have already known. But whether
or not the Republican gains indicate
a sufficient swing away from Roose
velt to insure the election of a Re
publican president in 1936 Is prob
lematical. The Republicans quite nat
urally hold the opposite view.
The Democrats, with considerable
justification, regard the results as
not unfavorable to their 1936 chances.
The Republicans, also with consid
erable justification, hold a directly
contrary view.
