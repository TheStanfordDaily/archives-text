# Duce Prepares War at Home

### 
ROME, Nov. 10 (/P). — Mussolini,
taking for granted the success of his
legions' campaign in East Africa, to
day prepared to win the war at
home, against the League of Nations
sanctions.
The second of II Duce's campaigns
—which involves the whole popula
tion and commercial trade of the na
tion —may lose as much in a year,
informed circles conceded, as the
invasion of Ethiopia would cost in
10 years.
Four cheering developments are:
Victory in Africa.
King Victor Emanuel's approval of
11 Duce's empire building.
Confidence that sanctions will
fail.
The League of Nations' desire
for peace.
The peaceful penetration into
Africa by the Italian northern ar
mies is utilized by the Fascists to
support their contention Italy .is
welcome there.
