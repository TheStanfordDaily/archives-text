# Fire Committee Ask For Wood
## Pyre Erection Day Less Than Two Weeks Off 
### 
With the big day for construction
less than two weeks off, members
of the Big Game Bonfire committee
are preparing for an intensive cam
paign for wood, according to Co
chairman Bob Hoover.
Eleven telephone poles, donated by
the Pacific Gas and Electric Com
pany, already are at the site of the
pyre, back of the power house, and a
35-foot square has been staked out
for the base.
Eight upright poles will be used
for the sides and a triangular cen
tral flue, similar to that used last
year, is planned. Since the fire will
be at the same place as last year,
use of the triangular flue will save
digging new vent ditches.
During the one-day building op
erations—planned 1o prevent Cali
fornians from raiding the pyre —
women of Hall and Row will serve
luncheon to workers, and cigarettes,
chewing gum and candy will be
provided.
Hoover urges all fraternities and
isororities to save packing cases and
j boxes for the bonfire. Railroad lies
!for the base will be delivered late
i this week, Hoover says, and eollec
! tions of wood from nearby com
jmunities also will start soon.
All men having free periods on
| Thursday are requested to arrange
ito work on November 21, with fresh
men especially asked to help.
