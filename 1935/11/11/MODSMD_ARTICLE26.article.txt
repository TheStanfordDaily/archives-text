# Mediocre Win Fires Stanford For Big Game
## Comparative Scores Give California Decided Superiority Over Indians; Bears Swamp Washington at Berkeley 
### GORDY FROST 
Stanford 3, U.S.C. 0; California 21, U.S.C. 7.
Stanford (», Washington 0; California 14, Washington 0.
There, as the result of a week-end of football fury, stands Stanford. No
longer is the big red toboggan called "finest on the coast." No longer is it
"mighty Stanford."
For now, by comparative scores, California is the Pacific's best. But
there remains a final test when comparative scores will mean nothing—

Fine annual Dig uame when btantord
and California will decide that issue
hand to h;ind. And what a Big Game
that will be!
But before that affair comes an
other test for the Indians—Montana
next Saturday. That game was orig
inally intended to be a breather, but
the Grizzlies this year have a pow
erful ball club that will bear watch
ing lest Stanford spend another fit
ful week-end.
It was Stanford's scoring combina
tion — Bobby Grayson covering
ground, Monk Moscrip kicking—that

again steered the Red Toboggan back
into the victory path with a 3-0 win
last Saturday after U.S.C.'s defeat
resisting Trojans gave Indian foot
ball hopes their weekly scare.
Bobby Gets Credit
For the third successive time it
was Bobby's slicing runs that car
ried Stanford into scoring territory.
Entering the ball game midway in
the fourth quarter after spending the
other half of that period recovering
his senses from a hard fall late in
the third, Grayson started the drive
that climaxed with Monk's winning
boot.
It staxis on the Stanford 45-yard
line. Bobby makes four at left tackle.
Then Jimmy Coffis, who turned in
the best ball game of his varsity
career at Stanford, goes to the Tro
jan 45. After two plays fail to gain,
Grayson fades, throws a pass to
Keith Topping on the 35.
Trojan Defense Holds
Bobby tries left end for no gain.
Then he drives through center to
the 30. Another play for no gain.
The dogged Trojan defense, respon
sible for 59 minutes of Stanford wor
ries, is still holding strong.
Then another pass, Grayson to
Topping, who flips a lateral to Doc
Luckett. Doc slips and goes down on
the 25. Bobby fades to pass but no
one Li open. He races through a wide
hole and down the sidelines to the
' 14. Two minutes of play remain.
Two more Grayson drives take it
to the 6. Tlie seconds race by. Stan
ford followers, b°th in the Coliseum
| and back home on the Farm, are
afraid the gun will come too soon.
Maneuver for Field Goal
The ball is out, of position. It's
j impossible for Monk to kick a place
| ment where it lies only ten yards in
from the sidelines on the 6. So Joe

Monk Moscrip came hack
from Los Angeles a day before
his team-mates to have a badly
bruised jaw X-rayed for pos
sible break. Pictures taken
yesterday at the Stanford Hos
pital showed no fracture.
Vigna sweeps right end to put it near
midfield.
And now Monk stands on the
13-yard line, calm, confident. Less
than a minute remains. The hall
comes hack, that pendulum-like
leg swings, lofts the oval through
the uprights as Stanford goes com
pletely mad. Monk did it again.
For the third successive time he
kicked Stanford to victory.
Though Stanford gained 281 yards
through scrimmage to the Trojans'
164 and 17 first downs to 7 for U.S.C.,
it was by no means the Indians' ball
game. The defensive walls of Troy
were almost as resistant as the con
crete of that massive stadium, but
on offensive ground play Howard
Jones' men were stopped dead. In
the air they were a constant men
ace and their defensive strategy was
nigh perfect with quick kicks util
ized to good advantage.
Lacks Old-time Punch
Stanford still lacked its offensive
punch of last year. True, the In
dians gained more than U.S.C. but
had it not been for Grayson's ability
to worm through most any kind of a
hole, the total would have been
considerably less.
Jim Coffis, however, was running
better from scrimmage during the
first half than he has yet this season
and steady Bill Paulman's forward*
drives were consistently good.
