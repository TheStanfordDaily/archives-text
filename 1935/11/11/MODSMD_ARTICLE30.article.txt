Stanford's protest is far removed
from the demonstration held by 2500
j students of New York University
! Friday, when they cheered a pledge
| not to "fight for my country in any
war" and booed University Presi
dent Dr. Frederick Robinson when
he called the pledge unconstitutional.
It is not so different from the dem
onstration at the University of Cali
fornia Friday when 2000 students
gathered at Sather Gate, heard war
decried, and peacefully went on their
way. In April this year, anti-war
speakers were egged and booed by
student crowds at U.C.
On last Thursday, the A.S.U.C.
dedicated a waking hour to the cause
of peace when Cal men and women
gathered in the university's men's
gym to hear Professors R. J. Kerner
and D. S. MacKay speak for good
will and no guns.
Demand Peace
Meanwhile, the National Commit
tee for Student Mobilization for
Peace reiterated their Armistice Day
proclamation, calling for student mo
bilizations everywhere. American
collegians are challenged by reality
on three points, the committee main
tained. They are: (1) To support
genuine neutrality legislation and to
prevent entanglements of the United
States in war; (2) To work for de
militarization of colleges and schools
by assuring passage of the Nye-
Kvale bill to make R.O.T.C. optional
instead of compulsory in certain uni
versities; (3) To insist on opportu
nities in the curriculum and out of
it for relating our education to these
' crucial problems; (4) To refuse to
I support the United States govern
| ment in any war it may undertake.
Included among the committee's
I sponsors are the Y.M.C.A., the Y.W.
j C.A., National Student Federation of
America, the National Student
League, and the Committee on Mili
i tarism in Education.

j Armistice Day protests against war
' are expected today from a score oT
'universities, where groups organ
ized either by local leaders or as
j affiliates of national bodies plan stu
i dent demonstrations for the preven
tion of wars and American partici
' pation in them.
800 Speaker
Stanford's protest is far removed
from the demonstration held by 2500
j students of New York University
! Friday, when they cheered a pledge
| not to "fight for my country in any
war" and booed University Presi
dent Dr. Frederick Robinson when
he called the pledge unconstitutional.
It is not so different from the dem
onstration at the University of Cali
fornia Friday when 2000 students
gathered at Sather Gate, heard war
decried, and peacefully went on their
way. In April this year, anti-war
speakers were egged and booed by
student crowds at U.C.
On last Thursday, the A.S.U.C.
dedicated a waking hour to the cause
of peace when Cal men and women
gathered in the university's men's
gym to hear Professors R. J. Kerner
and D. S. MacKay speak for good
will and no guns.
Demand Peace
Meanwhile, the National Commit
tee for Student Mobilization for
Peace reiterated their Armistice Day
proclamation, calling for student mo
bilizations everywhere. American
collegians are challenged by reality
on three points, the committee main
tained. They are: (1) To support
genuine neutrality legislation and to
prevent entanglements of the United
States in war; (2) To work for de
militarization of colleges and schools
by assuring passage of the Nye-
Kvale bill to make R.O.T.C. optional
instead of compulsory in certain uni
versities; (3) To insist on opportu
nities in the curriculum and out of
it for relating our education to these
' crucial problems; (4) To refuse to
I support the United States govern
| ment in any war it may undertake.
Included among the committee's
I sponsors are the Y.M.C.A., the Y.W.
j C.A., National Student Federation of
America, the National Student
League, and the Committee on Mili
i tarism in Education.
