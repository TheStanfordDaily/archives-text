# Many Upsets Seen In Saturday Tilts
## 
### 
I
, Upsets and ties galore featured
j Saturday's football games all over
i1 he country. Most important of the
j upsets to the Coast was California's
14-0 victory over Washington. Still
j among the Rose Bowl contenders
; until they tangled with Stub Alli
' son's Bears, ihe Huskies lost all
| chance of a Pasadena trip.
California, still unbeaten and
untied, is one of three Coast teams
I retaining hopes to play in the New
| Year's Day classic. Stanford and
; U.C.L.A. are the others. Held to a
: last-minute 3-0 win over the sur
prising Trojans, Thornhill's men
may yet make that third succes
-1 sive trip to the Bowl if they can
down Montana and California.
U.C.L.A. faces its severest test to
| day when it tries to stop the un
; beaten aerial circus ol Southern
Methodist. Even if the Bruins clear
the Mustang hurdle, which they are
not expected to do, they must de
feat St. Mary's to have any chance

of being chosen over Stanford, if the
Indians win the Big Game.
Slip Madigan's Gaels will be no
set-up for the Bruins, in spite of
their 7-7 tie with Fordham Satur
day. St. Mary's was a slight favorite
over the Rams. Another tie, which
has greater significance to Cardinal
followers, was the 7-7 affair between
Montana and Gonzaga, conquerors of
Washington State.
Perhaps most unlooked-for of
Far Western results was Oregon's
13-0 win over Oregon State. Cali
fornia's 12-7 triumph over Stan
ford in the Little* Big Game was
fully expected.
On the national front, Northwest
ern sprang the biggest surprise with
a 14-7 victox-y over Notre Dame.
Wisconsin defeated Purdue, 8 to 0, in
another upset. Princeton swamped
Harvard, 35 to 0; Nebraska took the
measure of Kansas, 19 to 13; Pitts
burgh whipped Army, 29 to 6; and
Minnesota conquered lowa. 13 to 6,
in other important games.
