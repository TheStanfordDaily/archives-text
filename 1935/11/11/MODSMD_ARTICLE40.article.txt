# Freshmen Fail To Break Little Big Game Jinx
## Indian Frosh Lose to Bear Eleven, 12-7 Cal Babes Score Winning Points with 50-yard Pass, Line Buck 
### bY Roger Kimball 
A perfect 50-yard pass, followed
by a five-yard run to a touchdown.
That was the margin by which the
California freshmen befit Stanford's
frosh in the stadium Saturday.
Twelve to seven was the score, and
the battle was even closer than those
figures indicate in this season finale.
By their defeat Saturday the In
dian Babes failed to break a severe
year jinx which Cal has held over
them since 1928.
Backs Break Away
Short passes from Lute Ades to
Vic Botturi, and runs by both star
Cub backs took the ball to Stan
ford's 26-yard line halfway through
the initial period. Dick Sutton, Card
center, recovered Ades' fumble at
this point, but the Bears got the ball
a moment later on the Indian 48
after one of deWitt's few short punts.
Bottari then faded back and heaved
the ball over Bill Kirsch's head to
Ned Thomas, Cub end, who jogged
ihe remaining five yards into the end
zone. Ades' attempted conversion
was wide.
Cal Stopped at Goal
Bradshaw's eleven made a fine
goal line stand shortly afterward,
stopping the visitors two yards short
of a score. A penalty for roughing
the kicker, and another Bottari-to-
Thomas pass, followed by Dave An
derson's three smashes at the line,
gave the Bears their second score,
after deWitt had kicked out. The
visitors again failed to add the ex
tra point.
Neither team could do much dur
ing the rest of the first half, but the
Indian frosh came back fired up
for the third quarter. Starting on
their own 4G, the Cards drove into
California territory for the first time
during the game. Wally deWitt's
beautiful kick, out of bounds less
than two yards from the Bear goal,
put the Blue and Gold outfit in a
bad hole.
Drive Nets Score
Ades booted the pigskin out to the
Cub 32, but Bill Kirsch, Ed Gamier,
and deWitt on line plunges, and
Kirsch on a short pass from deWitt,
reached the nine-yard marker, where
Stanford had a first down. DeWitt
then threw a pass over center to Don
Butler, who snatched the ball from
between two Bears in the end zone
and the Cardinal frosh had six points.
Gamier made it seven with a per
fect place-kick.
The third quarter ended a moment
later, but Stanford continued to hold
the upper hand in the final session.
DeWitt's smashes and Kirsch's off
tackle slants, on which he looked
good, brought the Card babes to the
California 35, but a fumble ruined
their chances. The Bears had the
ball on Stanford's 40 as the game
ended.
DeWitt's Average Large
Outstanding from a Cardinal
standpoint were DeWitt's 39-yard
kicking average, Sutton's backing up
of the line, and Pete Zagar's numer
ous hard tackles.
Stanford's line-up was as fol
lows:
Ends, Hege, Stojkovich, Butler,
and Hawkins; tackles, Zagar, Carna
han, and B. West; guards, Shreve,
Gustafson, McMillan, and McWayne;
center, Sutton; quarterback, Gar
nier; halfbacks, Fay, Kirsch, Huebel,
and Carew; fullback, deWitt (game
captain).
