## 
###

proved too much for the Indian polo
ists last Friday when it downed

the Bruin tank, but Stanford came
back the next day against the highly
publicized Trojan tankmen and took
them, 11-3.

played heads up ball and were
more evenly matched than the

| offensive machine from action.

j 20 threatening throws.

time with U.S.C. as the Stanford

' by Troy were against the second
string during the second half.
Don Peterson was outstanding for
! Stanford, scoring seven goals. Co
