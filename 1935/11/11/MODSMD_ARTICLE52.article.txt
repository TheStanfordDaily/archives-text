### 
Although student observance of Armistice
concentrated mainly in the "Eleventh Hour
Demonstration Against War" throughout the
country Friday, Stanford's own Armistice ob
servance comes today. The nation-wide stu
dent declaration for peace was called Friday
since most colleges, unlike Stanford, do not
have sessions on November IT.

Seventeen years
after the Armi
stice, the world
seems in danger
of forgetting the
great lesson that
it should have
been taught hv
the debaele which
ended November
11, 1918. Those
seventy-odd Stan-

lord iiK'n w 110 gave iiieir lives lor democ
racy"- and for peace in company with mil
lions of others seem almost to have died in
vain.
Yet some sane sentiment for peace appears
to he gathering momentum and form in this
country with students in the van. The Stu
dent Mobilization for Peace is no crack-pot
hodv, hut is well hacked and h;is the definite
aims of genuine neutrality legislation, dcinili*
tari/.alion of colleges, opportunities for edu
cation in crucial problems, and refusal of sup
port to the United States in any war it might
undertake.
At New York University, 2.")()0 students cre

ated a stir by booing their president Friday
when he termed their pledge unconstitutional.
At California, where only last April anti-war
speakers were booed and rotten-egged, 2000
students met at Sather (late to quietly hear of
war's horror.
At Stanford, all itnernationalists and peace
lovers are given their opportunity tonight at
an A.S.S.U. bullet supper in the Women's
Gym. International Committee of the A.S.S.U.
has indicated that it is on its toes by schedul
ing this event, which will start at o'clock.
Not only will speeches and discussions deal
with Hit' Armistice and peace theme, but the
program aims to fill a campus need for a get
together of all foreign students and all Ameri
can students who have an interest in the field
of world relations and problems.
So that there may be no barriers, Ex Com
mittee lias made an appropriation to cover the
supper's expenses. There will be no fees; only
requisite for admission is an interest in the
day's theme: internationalism and world
peace.
Manifestly, the only thanks that can prop
erly repay International and Ex Committees
for their bold innovation is a large, lively at
tendance.
Possibly at this meeting it may be pointed
out that Armistice Day might well cease to
be an occasion for honoring the war dead,
which is more properly done on Memorial
Day, and commemorating the ending of a
war now seventeen years dead â€”and turn to
ward a new meaning and a new usefulness as,
perhaps, International Peace Day.
