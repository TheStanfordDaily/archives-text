# Heed Taken This Week Of Old-Timer's Moans
## 
### 
Stanford's Hough of the old regime, the
kind that now resides in the Old Union and
pores over law books, pricks up his ears and
proudly struts about the campus today as a
result of the declaration that the current week
has been set aside as Observe Tradition Week.
Prompted by general laxity on the part of
students in upholding even those customs
that are held most inalienable by members of
the Old (iuard, and brought to a head by clam
orings from these old-timers last week, a full
live-day period of strict regard for "Stanford
isms" among tlie Farm populace was deemed
appropriate.
During the coining week, upperelassinen
will disport the corduroy, nicotine addicts will
deposit butts before entering the Quad, Stan
ford mademoiselles and more naive freshmen
will refrain from treading upon the sacred
Law Steps, and, most significant of all, "Hello"
again will be the password among Farm men
and women alike.
Whether it turns into the old-time Hough's
last gasp of protest against a decadence of
traditions and "sissifying of the Farm," or
whether it serves its intended purpose of
ushering Stanford into bigger and better cus
tom-consciousness, Observe Tradition Week
at least temporarily will dispel the erroneous
tradition, apparently held by many of the
more blase, that the University "wasn't
horned, it just grew."
