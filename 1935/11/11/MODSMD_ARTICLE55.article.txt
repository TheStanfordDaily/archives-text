# Our Hasher Sez

Guess what.
This is not fire prevention week, or save-a-nickel
week, or boy scout week, or take-an-aspirin week, bui
this is SAVE TRADITION week.
One tradition Our Hasher would like to save is
that old, old one they used to have in bygone days
that Stanford teams made touchdowns.
If it weren't for the good old athlete's foot Saturday
Stanford wouldn't have any more chance to play ring
around the Rosey Bowl. But I'd much rather have
them play rings around the California Bear.
If things get any worse, the Rally Committee will
have to start picketing local stores again. At that, the
Rally Committee throws much cuter boycotts than
they do rallies.
Ihe Delta Chis no sooner got their kitchen force
established in the new Delta Chi castle than the second
boy and the cook got up a little informal rumpus. It
started out when the negro cook threw a chocolate
pie at the second boy, saying, "Ah think it all make
him heah what ah say better, but he mussa got some
in 'is ears cuz he couldn't seem tf> heah me."
T he second boy's ears may have been stopped up,
but he was ready for plenty of action.
He made a sharp flank movement, whipped out a
butcher knife, and started to cure any appendicitis
attacks the cook might have at the time or in the future.
The cook was considerably broken up about the
whole affair, and the chocolate pie kid is looking for
another second boy job.
