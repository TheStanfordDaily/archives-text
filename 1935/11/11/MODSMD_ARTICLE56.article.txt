# BULLETIN FROM WONG'S KITCH
## 
### 
Our Hasher was questioned by Wong on the sub
ject of the current attractions at S.F. theaters, which
campus cooks patronize while campus students are
patronizing Sunday night suppers.
"Any Art show in city?" asked Wong.
Your correspondent was quite surprised to see the
aesthetic spirit budding in the menial breast.
"What you mean, 'Art show,' Wong?" I asked.
"You don' know what 'Art show' mean?" asked
the cook scornfully. "Lotsa dance. Lotsa sing. T;tke
u mod do'. Pohlice cum. Girl say, 'We do for Art'."
The wisdom of centuries, yes sir.
