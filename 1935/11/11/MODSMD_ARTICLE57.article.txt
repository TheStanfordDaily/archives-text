# Bull Session
## OLYMPICS IN BERLIN? 
### 
Dubbing protest of the Berlin Olympics "dabbling
in foreign religious questions" is the newest defense
for the projected 193(5 games in Germany.
It was made by Count Henri Baillet-Latour, presi
dent of the International Olympic Committee, and was
reprinted and editorially elaborated by The Daily in
an article stating that American protestees are mixing
"religion and politics with clean amateur sport" when
they campaign against American Olympics participa
tion.
ii: * * *
Count Henri, and apparently The Daily as well, do
not realize that for Jews the problem of persecution
is not spatial and political, but world-wide and social.
The Ghetto and the gabardine, the Russian pogroms
of the latter nineteenth century, are dark horrors too
close to the modern emancipated Jew for him to forget
them in favor of an athletic contest.
But not content with branding protestees as "med
dlers," Count Latour declares that their campaign is
based on "misstatements and many lies." Totally dis
regarding the verity of the specific instances of German
persecution reported in the news, one need merely point
to the volume of such news. Is it possible that the tens
of thousands of "persecution-items" which have come
out of Germany since the accession of Hitler are com
plete fabrications? Is there absolutely no supporting
evidence for the reams of anti-racial copy that have
seen the light of print?
>i» * >l« >|t
True enough, their own problem of racial freedom
is much more important to the Jews than the political
expediency of letting Berlin have the Olympics as
originally planned.
Frankly, few of them consider anything but their
well-founded belief that world recognition of Ger
many would indirectly menace Jewish freedom every
where. They are alarmed that the world thinks more
of a sporting event and of political expediencies than
of racial freedom and justice.
But those who have no basic rights in jeopardy,
those who are campaigning against the Olympics for
reasons of sportsmanship, and for the Olympics be
cause they believe Germany will abide by Olympic
ideals—both point to the real unfairness of the Ber
lin Games. For both classes have repeatedly said they
would not accept a prejudicial selection of the German
team. With their ideals of sportsmanship held so high,
can either class believe that Germany, whose anti
racial campaign is well attested to by the mere volume
of persecution-news, could suddenly turn face and
maintain those ideals?
This Bull Sessioner believes that Germany cannot
live up to Olympic requirements. Purely for that rea
son, he insists, the term "Berlin Olympics" is a mis
nomer. There can be no such thing as Olympics in
Berlin. —Bob Eisenbach

evidence for the reams of anti-racial copy that have

True enough, their own problem of racial freedom
is much more important to the Jews than the political
expediency of letting Berlin have the Olympics as
originally planned.
Frankly, few of them consider anything but their
well-founded belief that world recognition of Ger
many would indirectly menace Jewish freedom every
where. They are alarmed that the world thinks more
of a sporting event and of political expediencies than
of racial freedom and justice.
But those who have no basic rights in jeopardy,
those who are campaigning against the Olympics for
reasons of sportsmanship, and for the Olympics be
cause they believe Germany will abide by Olympic
ideals—both point to the real unfairness of the Ber
lin Games. For both classes have repeatedly said they
would not accept a prejudicial selection of the German
team. With their ideals of sportsmanship held so high,
can either class believe that Germany, whose anti
racial campaign is well attested to by the mere volume
of persecution-news, could suddenly turn face and
maintain those ideals?
This Bull Sessioner believes that Germany cannot
live up to Olympic requirements. Purely for that rea
son, he insists, the term "Berlin Olympics" is a mis
nomer. There can be no such thing as Olympics in
Berlin. —Bob Eisenbach
Dubbing protest of the Berlin Olympics "dabbling
in foreign religious questions" is the newest defense
for the projected 193(5 games in Germany.
It was made by Count Henri Baillet-Latour, presi
dent of the International Olympic Committee, and was
reprinted and editorially elaborated by The Daily in
an article stating that American protestees are mixing
"religion and politics with clean amateur sport" when
they campaign against American Olympics participa
tion.

Count Henri, and apparently The Daily as well, do
not realize that for Jews the problem of persecution
is not spatial and political, but world-wide and social.
The Ghetto and the gabardine, the Russian pogroms
of the latter nineteenth century, are dark horrors too
close to the modern emancipated Jew for him to forget
them in favor of an athletic contest.
But not content with branding protestees as "med
dlers," Count Latour declares that their campaign is
based on "misstatements and many lies." Totally dis
regarding the verity of the specific instances of German
persecution reported in the news, one need merely point
to the volume of such news. Is it possible that the tens
of thousands of "persecution-items" which have come
out of Germany since the accession of Hitler are com
plete fabrications? Is there absolutely no supporting
evidence for the reams of anti-racial copy that have
seen the light of print?
