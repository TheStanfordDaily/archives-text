THE GAIETIES this year will be
lush with good tunes. Mac Gordon,
who's contributed so many of the
hits of past Gaieties, has come
through again with "The Wind and
the Rain," which we predict will be
the big hit this year, and a clever
! boy-and-girl number, "What Makes
You Think I Do?"
Dudley Nix, who wrote that na
tion-wide hit, "So Lovely and So
Sweet," has two numbers in the
Gaieties, "Freshman Glide" and
'"It's Just the Principle of the
: Thing."
Dulce Parker has contributed
"Falling Star" and the clever "Phi
Beta Kappa in Love." A tune which
j we haven't heard, but one that has
1 been enthusiastically hailed by as
sociate musical directors Fred Nagel
and Gordy Heche is "Night Cry,"
i by Elisabeth Rhodes.
And from the pen of Director

' Frank O'Neill himself has come an
; inspired bit of nonsense titled "There
! Are No Chi Omegas in Bombay."
! Stirred by the success of songs
i from Princeton's musical of last
| spring, "Stags at Bay," Gaieties
tunes will be well plugged. Frankie
Masters will play them on the air,
! and a week from tomorrow will be
i "Gaieties Night" at the Frantic, with
i some of the better musical acts from
the show appearing in person,
j NBC also has consented to plug the
tunes, with Meredith Willson's or
chestra scheduled to play them on
! several broadcasts and the possi
bility of a nation-wide program be
ing devoted to Gaieties songs and
acts.
STANFORDISM: After one of the
early Gaieties tryouts, a group gath
ered around the piano to sing while
Winstead Weaver played some of the
i old favorites. Finally someone piped
up, "Play something nobody knows
; —the Hymn for instance."
