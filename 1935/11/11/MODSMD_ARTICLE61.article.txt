| "HANDS ACROSS THE TABLE"
At the Stanford Theater
B "Hnncls Across the Table" Is
Paramount's imitation of "It
Happened One Night." It is
as good as the 1935 Academy
Award winner in everything except
plot.
Concerning the love of an ambi
j tious manicurist and the impover
ished son of the once idle rich, who
are both determined to marry money,
the story is saved from being trite
by the clever acting of its principals,
Fred Mac Murray* and Carole Lom
bard.
Fred Mac Murray is given an op
portunity to display his flair for
comedy glimpsed in "The Gilded
Lily," and for once in her career
Carole Lombard is something more
than a beautiful clothes-horse.
The funniest scene in the picture
is the one in which Mac Murray tries
to cure Miss Lombard's hiccough*,
and by so doing gets a severe case
himself.
Also on the bill is a Western horse
opera called "Stormy."
â€”Prager
Subway construction in Berlin
endangers a huge palace which the
United States intended to use as an
embassy.
