# NABBED FOR NOISEMAKING
## 
### 
, The Editor, Sir:
Palo Alto has been and is a para
site on the University, and still its
] cinemas seem to derive great pleas
: ure out of placing stool-pigeons in
the balconies to grab the unwary
Stanford student who may sputter
I somewhat in a good Stanfordian
fashion at pictures not fit to be
j shown.
Then the student is whisked away
jto the local bastile without even
j having the price of his ticket re
l funded and is fingerprinted and
frisked like a local Dillinger, and
then lodged for the night or until
someone goes his bail.
The local theaters are hostile to
I the campus which gives them their
j living and if they want to "kill the
goose that lays the golden eggs" let's
j help them by all means and boycott
these local examples of parasites.

It seems that the local police, at
the request of annoyed Paly citi
zenry and not the theaters, arc
placing plain clothes men in shows
to nab noise-making high-school
and college students on the charge
i oi "disturbing public assemblage."
