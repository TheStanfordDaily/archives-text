| The Editor, Sir:
i Much-Ticketed-Driver" sounds a
| pathetic note. He evidently has a
| great many places to go, and hardly
I enough time to get there.
He forgets that there is always a
j "first time" for an accident, and that
once a child s—or even a dog's life
i has been crushed out—no amount of
| being sorry can bring that life back
or case the hurt of the bereft ones.
Has "Much-Ticketed-Driver" hap
| pened to notice that throughout the
! entire country the largest number of
i accidents involve drivers 19 years of
| age? But doubtless "Much-Ticketed
Driver" is either 20 or 18—or more
j likely 16.
