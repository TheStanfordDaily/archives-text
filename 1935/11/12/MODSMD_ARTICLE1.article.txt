### 
HOME, Nov. 11 —Italy for
mally protested to half a hundred
nations tonight the adoption of sanc
tions by the League of Nations
against her.
This was disclosed a few hours
after Premier Mussolini paraded
part of his 1,200,000 soldiers and
warned the world that Italy can
take care of herself in Europe as
well as in Africa.
Separate notes were dispatched to
all governments participating in
sanctions, one week before they are
to go into effect.
A spokesman explained that al
though the League itself voted sanc
tions, it delegated their applications
to a committee of representatives of
sovereign nations.
Italy, lie added, has received no
official notice that sanctions have
been invoked, but "We know they
have been, because we read about
them in newspapers and have ex
perienced their effects."
He explained the protests were
made directly to individual nations
rather than through the League, be
cause Italy regards the sanctions
committee as outside the League.
A text of the note may be made
public tomorrow.
Italy also protested separately to
the Egyptian government because
of its adherence to sanctions. Egypt
is not a member of the League.
Informed circles regarded the
protest as a continuation of Italy's
policy of accepting sanctions "with
sacrifices and discipline," but at the
same time contesting their legality.
