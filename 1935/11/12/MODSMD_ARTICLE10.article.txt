# Ryan Laboratory Was Power Company's Gifts to Stanford

Southeast of the Quad in a field of
waving oats stands a big gray box
like building with clusters of wires
strung to towers alongside and much
mysterious machinery within. It
represents the contribution of a
great scientist—the late Dr. Harris J.
Ryan of Stanford—to the field of
electrical engineering.
In 190(5 Dr. Ryan began to inves
tigate the use of high voltage
electricity — voltages commonly
thought too "hot" for men to han
dle. For 20 years he persued his
research, became probably the
world's outstanding authority on
high voltages. In 1926, in appre
ciation of his almost perpetual
contribution to the field of power

transmission, a group of seven |
power companies gave Stanford
and Dr. Ryan the Harris J. Ryan
High-Voltage Laboratory.
Today the pioneering with "hot
j juice" is being carried on by Dr. Jo- !
! seph S. Carroll, present director of
the Ryan Lab and successor to Dr.
Ryan. With a potential of 2,100,000 ,
| volts at his command—a voltage in j
j the magnitude of lightning bolts and |
■ capable of jumping across a 26-foot j
air-gap—Dr. Carroll has solved many |
j a problem for the electrical com- !
j panies.
With the aid of the battery of six I
great transformers, which, exceeded j
in size by none in the world, step up j
the ordinary 110-volt household cur- '
rent to two million volts. Dr. Carroll
solved the unprecedented problem of '

transmitting 287,000 volts over the i
275 miles from Boulder to Los An
geles without great power losses.
Similarly, by use of a specially
constructed wind tunnel, he de
termined why a transmission line
that will stand up under an 80-
mile gale is often in danger of de
struction from the vibration of a
6-miles-an-hour breeze.
Since electricity at two million
volts is nothing less than chain- J
lightning under control, it has been
necessary to develop instruments
which can measure what happens in
one hundred-millionth of a second
—and photograph it.
It is one of Dr. Carroll's secret
ambitions actually to catch a light
ning bolt, as Franklin did, and bring
it into his laboratory and tame it.

With the aid of the battery of six I
great transformers, which, exceeded j
in size by none in the world, step up j
the ordinary 110-volt household cur- '
rent to two million volts. Dr. Carroll
solved the unprecedented problem of '

transmitting 287,000 volts over the i
275 miles from Boulder to Los An
geles without great power losses.
Similarly, by use of a specially
constructed wind tunnel, he de
termined why a transmission line
that will stand up under an 80-
mile gale is often in danger of de
struction from the vibration of a
6-miles-an-hour breeze.
Since electricity at two million
volts is nothing less than chain- J
lightning under control, it has been
necessary to develop instruments
which can measure what happens in
one hundred-millionth of a second
—and photograph it.
It is one of Dr. Carroll's secret
ambitions actually to catch a light
ning bolt, as Franklin did, and bring
it into his laboratory and tame it.
Southeast of the Quad in a field of
waving oats stands a big gray box
like building with clusters of wires
strung to towers alongside and much
mysterious machinery within. It
represents the contribution of a
great scientist—the late Dr. Harris J.
Ryan of Stanford—to the field of
electrical engineering.
In 190(5 Dr. Ryan began to inves
tigate the use of high voltage
electricity — voltages commonly
thought too "hot" for men to han
dle. For 20 years he persued his
research, became probably the
world's outstanding authority on
high voltages. In 1926, in appre
ciation of his almost perpetual
contribution to the field of power

transmission, a group of seven |
power companies gave Stanford
and Dr. Ryan the Harris J. Ryan
High-Voltage Laboratory.
Today the pioneering with "hot
j juice" is being carried on by Dr. Jo- !
! seph S. Carroll, present director of
the Ryan Lab and successor to Dr.
Ryan. With a potential of 2,100,000 ,
