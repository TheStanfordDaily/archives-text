### 
ALAMEDA, Nov. 11 (/P). — The
waters of yacht harbor welcomed
the giant Pan-American Airways
China Clipper to her home base
when the huge airliner eased to a
graceful stop at 2:20 p.m. (P.S.T.)
today.
Twenty-five tons of aircraft,
powered by four big Wasp, 800-
horsepower motors, the China

prime advance in passenger air
craft, officials declared.

from Miami, Fla., by way of Aca
pulco, Mex., and San Diego. She
is the first of five similar craft, to be
used in California-to-the-Orient
service.

cisco Bay area 45 minutes on her
flight from San Diego, the clipper
seaplane zoomed downward onto
the bay amid the cheers of 5,000
persons. The watchers swarmed
toward the big ship and shouted
applause to her commander, Capt.
Edwin C. Mustek, as she edged her
way to the mooring dock.
Pan-American officials announced
there would be two short flights this
afternoon, on which city officials of
the bay communities would be
guests.
