# Yas, Suh, Mustang Band Romps Along
## 
### WARREN BREED 
They play the "Tiger Rag." They
play "She'll Be Comin' Round the
Mountain." They play the "St. Louis
Blues," and the "Limehouse Blues,"
and Iho "Twelfth Street Rag," and
"Dinah" . . . And when they play
they really swing it.
Such is the Southern Methodist
band, guest artist at the Stanford-
Troy fracas Saturday. It's a de
cided leftist movement in college
hands, a New I>cal in stadium
spirit engendering. Instead of
playing "l ight on for Dear Old
S.M.IV' or "Stars and Stripes
Forever." they rock the "River
boat Shuffle," or one of the above
mentioned hot standards.
Indian rooters forgot all about the
game when the organization, about
35 strong, clad in brilliant bright
blue and scarlet and big silver but
tons, romped into the Coliseum a f
double time, led by Peruna, little
Mustang pony, and a high-stepping
pair of leaders, one male and one
female.
Tliej were tooting (heir tliemc-

song, "She'll Be Loaded with
Peruna When She Comes," and the
male was Drum Major Frank
Malonc, the female. Betty Bailey.
Stanford rooters resumed their
interest in the name when the
rhythmsters from Dallas took seats
next the Troy rooting section, but
when they played at times-out both
rooting sections and a good portion
1 of the 45.000 there felt toes tapping
' and shoulders swaying.
They dispense a brand of torrid
ja/./.ique reminiscent of Benny
Goodman, or Louis Armstrong, or
Red Nichols. Frequent, and very
hot. are solos and breaks by the
first trumpet, trombone, or clar
inet. Arrangements are clone by
these first-chair men.
J They played a tour of the Middle
i West and East last summer, and their
j reception was so unanimous that
I they were late for school in Septem
ber. Personally, the bandboys are
very reticent about praise. They
| just smile, and agree in that dulce

I of like it down there."
