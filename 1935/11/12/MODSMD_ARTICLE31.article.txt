# Stevens, Anderson Break Altitude Record
## Stratosphere Flight Successful; Balloon Ascends 14 Miles Valuable Scientific Data Gathered; Fliers Land On Farmers' Field 
### 
WHITE LAKE, S.D., Nov. 11 UP).—
A gentle landing by the world's
largest balloon in a field near here
late today successfully ended man's
most sensational venture into the
heights of the stratosphere to an un
cilicially recorded altitude of 14
miles.
Two American army fliers, Cap
tains Albert VV. Stevens and Orvil
A. Anderson—if later calibrations
sustain their barometric compu
tations of 74,000 feet as zenith of
their soaring—by the daring ven
ture returned to America the
world's altitude record and
brought science's knowledge of
the super-atmosphere.
Their epic feat, climaxing a six
weeks long wait for favorable weath
er and compensation for two pre
vious disappointments on their part,
moved .smoothly to its climax after
the rocky wall of their camp's base
was cleared—by only 50 feet—at 8
o'clock (C.S.T.) this morning.
Ihey landed at 4:13 p.m. (C.S.T.)
after eight hours and 13 minutes of
adventure which thrilled the
world, some 240 miles to the west
and north (if their camp near Rapid
(. ity, S.D. ,
'iho 74,000-foot level was the
flight goal. If the altitude records
are authenticated Stevens and An
derson passed even the unofficial
record set in 1934 by three Russian
stratosphere fliers, whose instru
ments, after a crash fatal to the
crew, showed they had reached 72,17G
feet.
