Do you think "Observe Tradition
Week" will have a lasting effect?
MERCEDES BEROMANN, presi
dent of Women's Conference: "I
think it will work out. pretty well,
since it is something different and
will make people remember tradi
tions they may have forgotten."
REX HARDY, dramatic manager:
"I think it is a good idea insofar as
traditions being observed are good.
Such traditions as the 'Hello' tradi
tion and the 'Law Steps' tradition
are worth-while and should be ob
served. I think it will serve to re
vive them."
JEANNE KEESLING, president of
Pan-Hellenic: "I think the week
should have a lasting effect. Too
many traditions have been allowed
te die out, and many people are in
terested in preserving them. This
should serve to recall them to
mind."
ADRIENNE JOHNSTON, Ex Com
mittee member: "I think that one of
the reasons Stanford's school spirit
has been so poor this quarter is that
the traditions have been allowed to
die out. Anything which will
strengthen the traditions will build
up school spirit, and that is what
Stanford needs."
