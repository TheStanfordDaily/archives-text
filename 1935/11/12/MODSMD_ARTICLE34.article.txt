# Christmas Bazaar Planned by Nurses

### 
"Do your Christmas shopping
early" is the slogan adopted by the
Nurses' Association, sponsoring a
bazaar and tea for the Nurses' Sick
Benefit at the Palo Alto Community
Center Thursday afternoon.
Booths will offer for sale all kinds
of gifts suitable for Christmas pres
ents, all the fancy work being made
by members of the association. Other
features will include a display of
winter clothes and music furnished
by a girls' orchestra.
