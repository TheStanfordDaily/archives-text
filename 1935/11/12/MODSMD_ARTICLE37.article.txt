It will cost you a maximum of six
months in thu Palo Alto jail, a $500
fine, or both, to make inappropriate
noises in local theaters.
And if you don't believe it ask
John McKenna Scott, Alpha Sig, who
was tossed out of the Fox Stanford
Theater November 1 and put in the
hoosegow on charges of disturbing
public assembly.
Because lie promised Chief of
Police Howard Ziuk that he would
spread the "no noise" gospel on
the campus if he was released,
McKenna escaped with only a
verbal dressing down sifter he had
been nabbed as a panic-manufac
turer when theater Lights went out
during the recent severe storm.
From that date henceforth plain
clothes men have been scattered
through theater audiences, waiting,
just waiting, for the wrong noise at
the right time from some ebullient
campusite.
Chief Zink describes law-violating
noise as "comic noise in tragic
places."
And that kind of noise, he ex
plains, is a misdemeanor under Palo
Alto city statutes. Police wiil
charge noise-makers with disturb
ing public assembly. Under the law,
they cannot kick you out, but must
arrest you.
The patrolling was undertaken
entirely without suggestion of pro
prietors of the Fox Stanford and
Varsity Theaters, but under or
ders of the chief himself, who was
attending the movies the night of
the big storm and the big noise.

"We don't want to do this," he de
clared today. "But both Stanford and
Palo Alto High School students are
forcing us to it. No one objects to
clapping, or other noise at the proper
time. But malicious booing is taboo."
