# Uclans Seek First Water Polo Crown
## Week-end Tilts To Decide Bruin's Title Hopes 
### 
Having subdued Coach Nort
Thornton's band of Indian water
poloists by maintaining an early two
goal lead throughout the tilt at West
wood last Friday, the mighty Bruins
will trek northward thi? week-end
seeking their first Pacific Coast Con
ference title.
Tlie L'clan tank squad is sched
uled to tangle with the Bears at
Berkeley Friday afternoon, after
which it will meet the Cardinals
for the second time at 11 o'clock
Saturday morning in Encina
Pools.
A single victory over either of
their northern opponents will clinch
the Coast crown for the Westwood
ites. But should California and
Stanford both upset them and, spec
ulating further,should the Cardinals
dryb the Bears on November 23, a
three-way tie for honors would re
sult.
To California, on the other hand,
would go the league title, if the
Bears and Indians rout the Bruins
this week-end and if the Berkeley
tankmen overcome Stanford two
weeks hence. Thus a rather com
plicated situation should be un
raveled by the results of week-end
water polo battles.
When the Farm swimmers clash
with the Bruins Saturday morning
the Uclans will be anything but
heavy favorites to repeat their 5-3
triumph of last week. Coach Thorn
ton's charges will be out to avenge
last Friday's defeat and to gain at
least a tie for the conference cham
pionship that they have won for the
past 22 out of 23 years.
