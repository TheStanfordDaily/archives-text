Starting the all-important last two
weeks of the season, Coach Dick
Bullis' varsity soccer team will en

them are with California's Bears,
whom Stanford has not defeated for
several years.
Indian and Bear soccermen will

10 o'clock Saturday morning wilh
everything at stake. If the Cardinals
can take that game and the return
contest on the Farm November 2u

the league. The frosh soccer team
will clash with Pescadero High

the varsity plays San Jose State on

accommodating more than 200 stu
