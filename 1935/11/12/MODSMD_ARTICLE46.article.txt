# Bones Hamilton Rejoins Indians For Light Drill
## Squad Resumes Practice With Four Crippled Men on Sidelines 
### Herb Diamond 
Bones Hamilton donned his uni
form instead of a sweat suit last
night and rejoined Tiny Thornhill's
charges.
It marked the first time that
Hamilton has turned out for a
regular practice session since Oc
tober I.lâ€”the day before he was to
suffer a ley reinjury in the U.C.L.A.
fracas. Bui as Bones cavorted
around the field, concentrating on
blocking and passing, not a few of
his team-mates were missing.
Monk Moserip, Wes Mullcr, Keith
Topping, and Bobby Grayson, all of
whom saw enough action against the
Trojans Saturday to merit a well
deserved rest, were excused from
drill.
It was Mosrrip's injured jaw that
supposedly sent him back to the
Farm a day before the rest of the
gridsters returned from the south
land. But now it comes to light
that Monk was planning an early
trip home more in the interest of
seeing his fiiancce than in having
his skull X-rayed.
Inasmuch as Moserip, his jaw se
verely bruised was already journey
ing northward Saturday night, he
was ordered to report to the hospital
as soon as he set foot in Palo Alto.
And report he did Sunday morning.
His hasty departure from Los
Angeles gave rise to much sport
page comment .which reported, in
effect, that IVlonk had been forced
to make the early trip because of
his injury. And this wasn't ex
actly true. No fracture was found
in his jaw bone, according to hos
pital reports, and Moserip prob
ably will trot out to the practice
field with his team-mates tonight.
Muller's nose was in far from top
notch shape after the U.S.C. tussle.
Whether it is broken or not is yet
unknown. Topping was shaken up a
bit as a result of his activities on the
Los Angeles gridiron, too. He, like
Jimmy CofFis and Joe Vigna, came
out ol' the battle with much less
skin and many more bruises than he
had when he went in.
Grayson's touchy ankle kept, him
away from practice yesterday. By
taking it easy he was strengthening
the sensitive nerve that has given
him no end of trouble. Nevertheless,
he will probably be back out on the
field today, participating in Thorn
hill's preparations for Saturday's
tussle with Montana.
