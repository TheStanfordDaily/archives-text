"STANFORD WILL BEAT
CAL"—BROUGHAM

'"Stanford will beat California as
sure as giraffes have long necks—"
That statement from Royal Brough
am, sports editor of the Seattle P.I.
who journeyed southward to watch
California down the Huskies, is mu
sic to battened Indian ears.
For no longer can Stanford sit
back and hear her name spoken
along with the word "mighty."
Now Stanford must stand for her
own. And most of that stand will
be made against an army of sports
critics who already are convinced
that California is the finest on the
coast.
So it's with great joy that Stanford
welcomes Mr. Brougham, along with
most of the Washington football
team, to the little band who still
l'eel, against much opposition, that
Stanford has a great football team.
One even greater than "mighty Cal."
You see, just after the Huskies
took their 14-0 licking from Cali
fornia last Saturday Brougham ap
proached them on a ticklish sub
ject. Said he, "Which team's best,
Bears or Indians?"
And from them:
Byron Haines — "Stanford has
stronger backs."
Chuck Bond—"Stanford's line is
better."
Elmer Lodd—"The Cards have too
much offense."
John Wiatrak — "Reynolds and
Muller are better than Lutz and
Herwig."
Max Starcevich—"lf Cal is as lucky
as that, nobody will ever beat them."
Jimmy Cain — "Cal's passes will
bother them, but Grayson and Mos
crip are a hard pair to ovei'cpme."
Jimmy Phelan—"lt's a tough one—
I'll have to think it over."
Those testimonials really mean
something for they come from
men who've been in the same ball
game with Stanford and Cal.
They don't do their talking from
the sidelines. And though there
were probably others on the

Washington team who figured the
liears as better than Stanford, the
general attitude was all Indian.
Says Brougham, "The Huskies
j think the breaks beat them Saturday,
j and they didn't make the same
charge alter Stanford beat them in
| a close game."
So at least those of the Northwest
| give the Cards a favorable word.
And just after Cal beat them by 8
| points more than did Stanford.

fornia last Saturday Brougham ap
proached them on a ticklish sub
ject. Said he, "Which team's best,
Bears or Indians?"
And from them:
Byron Haines — "Stanford has
stronger backs."
Chuck Bond—"Stanford's line is
better."
Elmer Lodd—"The Cards have too
much offense."
John Wiatrak — "Reynolds and
Muller are better than Lutz and
Herwig."
Max Starcevich—"lf Cal is as lucky
as that, nobody will ever beat them."
Jimmy Cain — "Cal's passes will
bother them, but Grayson and Mos
crip are a hard pair to ovei'cpme."
Jimmy Phelan—"lt's a tough one—
I'll have to think it over."
Those testimonials really mean
something for they come from
men who've been in the same ball
game with Stanford and Cal.
They don't do their talking from
the sidelines. And though there
were probably others on the

Washington team who figured the
liears as better than Stanford, the
general attitude was all Indian.
Says Brougham, "The Huskies
j think the breaks beat them Saturday,
j and they didn't make the same
charge alter Stanford beat them in
| a close game."
So at least those of the Northwest
| give the Cards a favorable word.
And just after Cal beat them by 8
| points more than did Stanford.

"STANFORD WILL BEAT
CAL"—BROUGHAM

'"Stanford will beat California as
sure as giraffes have long necks—"
That statement from Royal Brough
am, sports editor of the Seattle P.I.
who journeyed southward to watch
California down the Huskies, is mu
sic to battened Indian ears.
For no longer can Stanford sit
back and hear her name spoken
along with the word "mighty."
Now Stanford must stand for her
own. And most of that stand will
be made against an army of sports
critics who already are convinced
that California is the finest on the
coast.
So it's with great joy that Stanford
welcomes Mr. Brougham, along with
most of the Washington football
team, to the little band who still
l'eel, against much opposition, that
Stanford has a great football team.
One even greater than "mighty Cal."
You see, just after the Huskies
took their 14-0 licking from Cali
fornia last Saturday Brougham ap
proached them on a ticklish sub
ject. Said he, "Which team's best,
Bears or Indians?"
