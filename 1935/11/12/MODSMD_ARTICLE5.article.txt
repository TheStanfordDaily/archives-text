## Radio Speaker Describes Changes in Schools 
### 
Two important aspects of the de
pression from the viewpoint of the
schools ai'e loss of funds and the
expansion and alteration of the task
for which the school is responsible,
said Professor Jesse B. Sears of the
School of Education, in a talk on
"Getting the Schools Out of the
Depression," on the Stanford Radio
Hour last night.
With regard to the reduced reve
nue, lie commented that although
the number of pupils has increased
by some 200,000 per year, there are
1,500,000 children housed in build
ings that are unsafe and unsani
tary. In addition to this, kinder
gartens have been closed in one
city out of nine, and classes for
handicapped children in one out
of eight.
The second aspect, that of the
schools' maintaining and advancing
the cultural level, has been affected,
according to Dr. Sears, by the ne
cessity of the schools cutting down
or abandoning many of their scien
tific outposts, and practically stop
ping efforts to keep abreast of on
coming social changes.
I)r. Sears believes that these
dangers can be met by distributing
school finances more evenly
throughout the country, and equal
izing their costs. With particular
regard to the more cultural aspect,
he advocates modernizing schools
everywhere, and paying teachers
sufficient to insure a healthy men
tal attitude.
Especially with regard to the lat
ter, Dr. Sears urges an attempt at a
better understanding of the schools
and their service, and also a com
prehension of the results of the de
pression upon the schools and the
possible remedies.
