# "Let the Winds of Freedom Blow"
## Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily Member of the Associated Press Observe-Tradition Program This Week Offers Last Bid for Revival of Customs 
### 
A.S.S.U. President Wallv Brooke's state
ment, printed in this morning's Daily, which
urges student regard for rapidly disappearing
Farm customs, adds an ofliciai note to the
current Observe Tradition Week.
Many of those students who tend toward
sophistication, who look upon school spirit
as "prep stuff," can see no reason for these
traditions, usages that have grown up with
the University and have added a fundamen
tal, underlying thing to the broader sense of
the phrase, "Stanford spirit."
The more inalienable of the Farm tradi
lions, tor the most part, were founded for one
of two definite purposes: as a token of respect
for the founders of the University, or as in
surance that Stanford's theme of social equal
ity among all students would be perpetuated
throughout the college generations.
In the latter category come the rulings that
there shall be no hat-check tipping or giving
of corsages at campus dances; the give-a-ride
custom; the tradition that Stanford men and
women are to be judged hv their own accom
plishments while at Stanford, not bv past per
formances or by a relative who chances to
bear a famous name; the 1 100's habitual use
of simplicity in dress on the Quad; and the
"Hello" custom. They all have the definite
objective of maintaining a spirit of equality

and banishing snobbishness on llie Farm.
Once every week, seniors are supposed to
plaee llowers upon the tomb of Mr. and Mrs.
Stanford; other traditions that have grown
tip out of respect for the founders are the
rule of no pool playing on Sunday and no
smoking on the Quad.
In addition, however, there are many wor
thy miscellaneous traditions. Some are main
tained for practical purposes, some for senti
mental reasons; but they are all useful ami
deserving of perpetuation.
The entire lone of the honor system, based
on the asumption that Stanford men are gen
tlemen, that Stanford women are ladies; the
tradition, established by Dr. Wilbur, that
"gasoline and alcohol do not mix"; a show
of sportsmanship at :i 11 athletic contests and
similar events; the specific usage of the axe
yell and the hymn, well-known by the old
time Rough—all of these have served to build
Stanford into an institution with a unique,
distinctive spirit of unity.
The foundation of this spirit that has come
to characterize the Farm is undergoing a test
this week. It has been rudely attacked during
the past few months by campus disregard of
the customs that go to make it up. Observe
Tradition Week is Stanford's one last bid for
revival of these customs.

In the latter category come the rulings that
there shall be no hat-check tipping or giving
of corsages at campus dances; the give-a-ride
custom; the tradition that Stanford men and
women are to be judged hv their own accom
plishments while at Stanford, not bv past per
formances or by a relative who chances to
bear a famous name; the 1 100's habitual use
of simplicity in dress on the Quad; and the
"Hello" custom. They all have the definite
objective of maintaining a spirit of equality

and banishing snobbishness on llie Farm.
Once every week, seniors are supposed to
plaee llowers upon the tomb of Mr. and Mrs.
Stanford; other traditions that have grown
tip out of respect for the founders are the
rule of no pool playing on Sunday and no
smoking on the Quad.
In addition, however, there are many wor
thy miscellaneous traditions. Some are main
tained for practical purposes, some for senti
mental reasons; but they are all useful ami
deserving of perpetuation.
The entire lone of the honor system, based
on the asumption that Stanford men are gen
tlemen, that Stanford women are ladies; the
tradition, established by Dr. Wilbur, that
"gasoline and alcohol do not mix"; a show
of sportsmanship at :i 11 athletic contests and
similar events; the specific usage of the axe
yell and the hymn, well-known by the old
time Rough—all of these have served to build
Stanford into an institution with a unique,
distinctive spirit of unity.
The foundation of this spirit that has come
to characterize the Farm is undergoing a test
this week. It has been rudely attacked during
the past few months by campus disregard of
the customs that go to make it up. Observe
Tradition Week is Stanford's one last bid for
revival of these customs.
A.S.S.U. President Wallv Brooke's state
ment, printed in this morning's Daily, which
urges student regard for rapidly disappearing
Farm customs, adds an ofliciai note to the
current Observe Tradition Week.
Many of those students who tend toward
sophistication, who look upon school spirit
as "prep stuff," can see no reason for these
traditions, usages that have grown up with
the University and have added a fundamen
tal, underlying thing to the broader sense of
the phrase, "Stanford spirit."
The more inalienable of the Farm tradi
lions, tor the most part, were founded for one
of two definite purposes: as a token of respect
for the founders of the University, or as in
surance that Stanford's theme of social equal
ity among all students would be perpetuated
throughout the college generations.
