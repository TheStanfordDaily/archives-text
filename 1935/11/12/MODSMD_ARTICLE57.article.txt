# Palo Alto Theaters Give Roughs a Questionable Blow
## 
### 
Possibly unwillingly the local theaters are
parly to another blow toward the inert body
of the once imposing Rough, for years it has
been his prerogative and joy to bird the pic
lures displayed al Paly cinemas when occa
sion so demanded.
Citizenry of thai village often enjoyed his
remarks with him, joining his fellows in egg
ing him on. I>ni the few soreheads and old
slers who would rather see Gloria Droop in
her latest sex drool than hear the Rough's
classic remarks, have prompted Palv's No. 1
law-'n'-ordcr man to act.
Claiming "it's getting to the point where
it's no longer funny," Chief of Police Zink is
now placing plain-clothed stooges in each
theater to arrest noisemakers as disturbers of
public assemblages.
First man arrested w:is a mild-mannered
Stanford student who vigorously claimed he
was wholcly innocent and one of his neigh
bors was the real culprit. This is not an un
likely possibility, in view of the many eases
of evicting the wrong man from a darkened
theater in the past, such as are known to most
show-at lending Roughs.
The chief's act in bowing lit ;i discontented
minority leaves Roughs without the right to
express disapproval of the poorer shows, un
less their intestinal fortitude is good. Half the
fun arising from Hop shows and inane come
dies will be lost to Paly citizens attending
shows.
Only recourse the Rough will now have
against the bum bills, other than slaying
away, may be a little sissy, but is fairly effec
tive. Namely, Roughs can now only go to the
manager personally, telling him which fea
tures are odoriferous, and possibly protest
their restricted right of expression.
