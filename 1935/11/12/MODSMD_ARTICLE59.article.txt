A senior woman walked into Sequoia Hall one day
last week, and asked, startled roughs lounging about,
"In what room are the Quad pictures being taken."
The startled roughs carefully explained that this was
Sequoia Hall, home of startled Stanford roughs.
"Yes," she said, "that's it. There's a sign up in the
Press Building which says, 'Quad office moved to
Woodpecker Lodge'."
The roughs, insulted, blushed for the poor woman.

Grayson, Stanford history major. The policeman eyed

sweater, shirt, and no tie. Explained Mr. Grayson:
"I was told that members of the football team were
to eat dinner here tonight, and it's 9 o'clock and I'm
hunßry."
The policeman agreed to the truth of the three ele
ments, eyed the coatless and tieless history major, and
said, "So what? Are you sure you're on the football
team?"
"Yea, I'm on the team," the history major said
slowly.
