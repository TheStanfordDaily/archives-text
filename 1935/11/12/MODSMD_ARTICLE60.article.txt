# Bull Session
## REDS FOR ROOSEVELT 
### 
Will the Communist party of the United States sup
port. Roosevelt in the 193G election ... as many have
stated it will . . . because they believe he is con
tributing to the downfall of capitalism?
* * * *
The answer is no. And why not? Because he is
opening the door to fascism, and if there is anything
that makes a Red see scarlet it's a dirty fascist. At
least this is what the Palo Alto Communists say, and
they seem to be as sane as any of the discipline of
Moscow.
# * * #
Ever been to a Communist meeting? They held
one right down in the heart of Paly last week. And
though none of Stalin's personal representatives were
there, and nobody suggested an immediate revolution,
it was made perfectly clear that Soviet Russia is the
promised land and the United States is a country of
starving masses and brow-beaten proletariat.
* * * *
Of course one couldn't expect even a Communist
meeting in Palo Alto to be anything but refined, and
this one was certainly all of that. They didn't have a
beetle-browed, horny-handed worker to harangue.
Gentle-voiced Comrade Mini Carson was the speaker
of the evening. She admits having been in this jail
and that, but she is a smartly dressed, well mannered
little woman with a soft voice and diction that would
put a public speaking teacher to shame.
* * # *
Comrade Mini strode up and down before the small
assemblage attempting to look stern and beating her
tiny fists together for over an hour. Quoth she:
"We have no use for Social Democrats and reformer
trade unionists whom people say are a part of our
movement . . . We are ready to ally with any group
that is fighting for a united workers' front . . . Fascism
is something to worry about in this country . . . We
aren't going to vote for Roosevelt . . . He does not
personify the most reactionary of the ruling class. . . .
Hearst and those who sympathize with him are tlv?
most outspoken of the fascists . . . Roosevelt's policy
of centralization of powers simply is opening the door
to make fascism easier."
H« t|< * *
After Comrade Mini's address, the chairman stood
up and started calling for "funds to help the cause,"
and actually managed to squeeze out a couple of
contributions. Then some women passed pleadingly
down the rows peddling the "Anti-Hearst Examiner,"
"The Voice of Youth," and the "Young Worker."
Finally, after Comrade-the-chairman had waved red
cards in the air and asked one and all to join the
cause, the audience of half a hundred, including three
Stanford students, rose and wandered out into the
night.
And the Communists, whose influence and power
are laughed at as being impossible, chalked up another
successful step in spreading their creed of rebellion
in this democratic nation. —John McClelland

and that, but she is a smartly dressed, well mannered
little woman with a soft voice and diction that would
put a public speaking teacher to shame.

Comrade Mini strode up and down before the small
assemblage attempting to look stern and beating her
tiny fists together for over an hour. Quoth she:
"We have no use for Social Democrats and reformer
trade unionists whom people say are a part of our
movement . . . We are ready to ally with any group
that is fighting for a united workers' front . . . Fascism
is something to worry about in this country . . . We
aren't going to vote for Roosevelt . . . He does not
personify the most reactionary of the ruling class. . . .
Hearst and those who sympathize with him are tlv?
most outspoken of the fascists . . . Roosevelt's policy
of centralization of powers simply is opening the door
to make fascism easier."
H« t|< * *
After Comrade Mini's address, the chairman stood
up and started calling for "funds to help the cause,"
and actually managed to squeeze out a couple of
contributions. Then some women passed pleadingly
down the rows peddling the "Anti-Hearst Examiner,"
"The Voice of Youth," and the "Young Worker."
Finally, after Comrade-the-chairman had waved red
cards in the air and asked one and all to join the
cause, the audience of half a hundred, including three
Stanford students, rose and wandered out into the
night.
And the Communists, whose influence and power
are laughed at as being impossible, chalked up another
successful step in spreading their creed of rebellion
in this democratic nation. —John McClelland
Will the Communist party of the United States sup
port. Roosevelt in the 193G election ... as many have
stated it will . . . because they believe he is con
tributing to the downfall of capitalism?

The answer is no. And why not? Because he is
opening the door to fascism, and if there is anything
that makes a Red see scarlet it's a dirty fascist. At
least this is what the Palo Alto Communists say, and
they seem to be as sane as any of the discipline of
Moscow.

Ever been to a Communist meeting? They held
one right down in the heart of Paly last week. And
though none of Stalin's personal representatives were
there, and nobody suggested an immediate revolution,
it was made perfectly clear that Soviet Russia is the
promised land and the United States is a country of
starving masses and brow-beaten proletariat.
* * * *
Of course one couldn't expect even a Communist
meeting in Palo Alto to be anything but refined, and
this one was certainly all of that. They didn't have a
beetle-browed, horny-handed worker to harangue.
Gentle-voiced Comrade Mini Carson was the speaker
of the evening. She admits having been in this jail
and that, but she is a smartly dressed, well mannered
little woman with a soft voice and diction that would
put a public speaking teacher to shame.
