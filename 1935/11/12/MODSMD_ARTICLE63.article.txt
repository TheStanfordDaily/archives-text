AMERICANISM: A poll of women
at Hunter College and N.Y.U. failed ,
to disclose one who would admit
never having been kissed. Only one
girl denied that she had ever had
"passes" made at her.
JUST STUFF: Zenith radio has
developed a windmill battery charg
er for farm radios. . . . Orville Knapp
opens Friday at Denver's Cosmo- j
politan Hotel, succeeding Henry ]
King. . . . Major Bowes makes j
$19,000 a week, over a million a year. J
AND NONSENSE: Twice has the |
editor censored this section. Wonder j
if he'll let me say something about
the terrific freshmen women?
MORE STUFF: Hotel Statler, Buf
falo, cuts plugs for rival niteries
when rebroadcasting radio pick-ups
from them to its rooms . . .A.T.&T..
on the eve of a Congressional in- j
vestigation into its monopoly, has t
offered to .reduce press rates on j
transmission of pictures and allow
papers to use their own equipment I
instead of the company's.
SCALLIONS and worms to the
Paly police for their stand on the
hissing and booing question. There |
are only two ways for roughs to
express their disapproval of movie I
fare: to refrain from going or to boo I
and hiss.
If they know nothing of the pic- j
ture, or have gone to see the other
part of a double bill, the only way
they can let the management know
how they feel is to be vociferous.
