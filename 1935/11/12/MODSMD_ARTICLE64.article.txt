"WHETHER THERE BE
KNOWLEDGE"
By Robert Henderson
This book is the nearest approach
to authentic college atmosphere in a
novel that this reviewer has yet en
countered. Although the university
which Is its locale is never named,
the author has obviously placed its
story at the University of Illinois,
where he is an instructor in English.
The tale, however, Ls completely
fictitious. It relates the senior year
of a likeable young chap who hap
pens to be one of the top college
journalists. It is a vivid story of this
one young man and the "growing
up" processes he goes through in his
last collegiate year. The plot is
woven against a background of stu
dent politics, fraternity rough
houses and dances, seductions, and
near-seductions.
The only place where the book
fails to ring true is In the sometimes
surprising ingeniousness of the pro-

I lagonist, who, being a campus big- j
i shot, really should know the ropes j
j better.
i Those who enjoy living college life
; will probably enjoy reading about it,
1 and this book will give women a !
j better insight into the lives and
j feelings of their male contempo
] raries than they are likely to get i
j from life.
