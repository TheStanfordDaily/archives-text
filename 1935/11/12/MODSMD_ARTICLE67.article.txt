# HELPING, NOT HURTING

The Editor, Sir:
Many forces are at work in the
world today, which, through misun
derstanding, hostility, and hate, are
splitting the family of nations farther
and farther apart. Thankfully, how
ever, there is one force which has
done much in the past to increase in
ternational understanding and co
operation. This force is the Olympic
Games.
The Olympic Games works
through the youth oi nations and
aids them to know and appreciate
each other. It is unfortunate that in

some countries racial discrimination
exists, that Californians discriminate
against the Japanese, Mississippians
against the Negroes, and Germans
against the Jews. Destroying the
I Olympic Games, however, will pro
vide no answer to this problem.
Nothing would be gained if Japan
had refused to compete in the Amer
! ican Olympics or if America with
j drew from German Olympics. . . .
Therefore, I suggest to yester
day's "Bull Sessioner" that he pon
| der the above before he advocates
a move that will destroy or at least
I seriously weaken the one thing that
; will free the Jewish people from
I persecution.
