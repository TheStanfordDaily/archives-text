# Extension Of Credit Asked By Roosevelt
## Bankers Convention Asks 'Hands Off' Policy Of Government Banks' Position Strong RFC Chairman Gives Plea For Extended Credit 
### 
NEW ORLEANS, Nov. 12 —
The American Bankers' Association
today heard requests from President
Roosevelt and heads of two federal
financial agencies for an extension
of credit after their own leader had
demanded government withdrawal
from the field of banking and other
private business.
Mr. Roosevelt's request was
made in a letter read before the
bankers' convention, in which he
said "All banks are now in a strong!
position."
The plea was echoed in addresses
by Jesse H. Jones, chairman of the
Reconstruction Finance Corporation,
and Leo T. Crowley, chairman of
the Federal Deposit Insurance Cor
poration.
Rudolf S. Heeht, president of the
association, another speaker, told
the convention the emergency is
passing and called on the govern
ment to step out of its "many fields
of business."
"I have watched with great in
terest the continued improvement
in banks throughout the country
during the past two years," Roose
velt's letter said.
"The progress which I reported to
the convention last year is being
maintained. Evidences of great re
covery are at hand.
"Bank portfolios and deposits re
flect this.
"I am gratified, as I am sure
every member of the American
Bankers' Association is gratified
to know, that all banks now arc in
a strong position, and I hope they
will take full advantage of the new
banking act and provide credit
where it can be done upon a sound
basis to business and industry and
to real estate."
The president said he was sure
that with co-operation between
banks, business and government —
and mutual confidence — "we will
soon solve our remaining problems."
The president's letter was read
to the convention by Jones, who
said he was "as anxious as any of
you can possibly be that the gov
ernment get out of the money
lending business as soon as pos
sible."
The R.F.C. head warned, however,
that the government "should not
get out too soon."
He asked a "fair deal for rail
roads," saying "entirely too many
are dominated by bankeis."
