# Courtesy Teas Begin Rushing
## Women Pay Initial Visit To Sororities Today 
### 
Freshman women will be enter
tained by sororities at a series of
courtesy teas, today, tomorrow, and
Friday, which mark the opening of
the first women's rushing period.
Sponsored by Pan-Hellenic, the
teas will be given between the hours
of 3:30 and 5 o'clock.
Quad clothes are the appropriate
dress, but hats may be worn. Jeanne
Keesling, president of Pan-Hellenic
advises all guests to be on time be
cause Pan-Hellenic rules decree that
all teas shall end promptly at 5
o'clock.
Although Pan-Hellenic has made
no provision for entertaining trans
fer women, the different sorority
houses have been giving teas to
which they were invited for the past
few weeks.
Winter quarter rushing will consist
of the customary lunches and din
ners. They will be held on January
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. Pledging
will take place on January 11.
