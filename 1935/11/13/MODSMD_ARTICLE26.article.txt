# Ex Committee Sees Vote System Flaws
## Group Refuses L.I.D. Request For Newspaper Election Revisions May Be Recommended 
### Annalce Whitmore 
Because the winner of the frosh
presidency had the slim majority of !
three votes, slight revisions of the j
election system might be advisable, "j
decided Ex Committee in last night's j
session. The constitution provides
that the winning candidate total a
majority of votes cast, which is dif
ficult with a large number running.
Election returns were, however, ac
cepted without question.
L.l.D.'s REQUEST to publish a
lewspaper, "Student Opinion," and
sell it on the Quad was refused. Ray
Jrubaker, introduced as "having a
jripe," pointed out that any minority
with something to say will not
be dissuaded by the non-sanction of
a paper.
Ex Committee decided that an or
ganization, to publish a paper, should
Ce recognized as permanent, then
present plans for policy, publication,
and finance for approval.
"We still think we have a right to
publish it, but Wilbur and Roth are
violently opposed, so I guess that
settles what Ex Committee thinks,"
said the members, exiting.
FRANK FULLENWIDER's com
mittee of one to investigate the
possibility of making more vol- i
umes of fiction available to stu
dents reported that "after inves
tigation so far, I definitely do not
favor having the A.S.S.U. go into
the library business." Having fic
tion on open shelves in the library
has resulted in a 25 per cent loss of
volumes in the past, he said, in
spite of the Honor Code.
Fullenwider will continue the third
week of his siege as one-man in

UTES, involving directions for the

Ex Committee, was suggested by
Jackie Flanders. "Is that your idea

The motion died because of lack
of a second.
