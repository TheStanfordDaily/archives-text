# Cripples Turn Out for Card Grid Practice
## Hamilton or Todd May Start Saturday In Grayson's Post Monk Practices Today Coffis and Reisner Share Left Half Position 
### Herb Diamond 
Monk Moscrip was the only first
stringer absent from the line-up
last night Â£is Tiny Thornhill sent his
gridiron warriors, cripples and all,
through another blocking and aerial
drill.
Monk's bruised jaw seems to be
rapidly healing and bis present
ailment is only a mild toothache.
Dr. Fritz Roth, squad psysician,
declares that Monk will probably
be back for practice tomorrow,
but whether or not he'll see heavy
action against the Grizzlies Satur
day is a matter for Tiny to decide.
Having abandoned his sweat suit
and daily trot around the grid,
Bones Hamilton returned Monday to
the varsity backfield. Thornhill has
been giving Bones assignments at
three of the four backfield posts.
Hamilton's current course has in
cluded everything but practice in the
fine art of quarterbacking, and he
may begin that before long. There is
a possibility that either he or Ray
Todd will start against Montana at
Bobby Grayson's regular fullback
spot; at any rate Bunes is certain to
be sent into the thick of the battle
for more than a few minutes Satur
day, since his recent period of con
valescence has rendered him some
what out of condition. And he can
stand some toughening for the Big
Game next week.
Big center Wcs Muller went
through most of the Indian-Trojan
melee and practice last night with
a broken nose. The break doesn't
seem to cramp his football style
very much because he wasn't even
wearing a nose-guard last night
and, what's more, doesn't intend to.
Bobby Grayson, both of his ankles
well taped, took it easy at practice.
He came in for plenty of roughing
both at the hands of Trojan tacklers
and in doing his own offensive share
for the Stanford cause. So when the
battle was all over Bobby was stiff
and sore, if not more severely shaken
up. That's why he'll take a hard
earned rest this week and Tiny will
keep him on the sidelines during
much of Saturday's tilt.
In place of Hamilton, who will
probably be moved to fullback
Saturday, Jimmy Coffis will alter
nate with Johnny Reisner at left
half, as both of these men have
plenty of the needed fight and
drive.
Included on the "slightly crip
pled" list, in addition to Moscrip,
Muller, and Grayson, were Horse
Reynolds, with what looked like, ap
propriately enough, a painful char
ley-horse. Pop Grant was limping
a bit on his strained ankle; and Joe
Vigna cavorted around wearing his
i usual skinless face.
Whatever overconfidcnee that
might have welled up in the squad
during the past several weeks is
now pounded deep into the turf of
the Los Angeles Coliseum, where it
was knocked last Saturday after
noon by an inspired band of Tro
| jans.
Montana, although handicapped by
i continual bad breaks this season.
| should be no set-up and the Big
Rod Machine realizes that fact. The
! team will continue this week to fort
! ify itself against the rough and toug'i
attack that the Montanans will prob
ably exhibit next Saturday after
noon.
