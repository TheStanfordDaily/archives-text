ROME, Nov. 12 (AP). —Italy served notice upon the world today that
sanctions might drive her from the League of Nations.
In a formal note of protest to all sanctionist countries, the government
branded the ban on imports from Italy a "true act of hostility."

The document coupled a declara- ♦
tion that "until now" Italy had not
wished to leave Geneva, with a re
quest for information from each of
the member nations on the manner
in which sanctions would be applied. 1
Responsible sources said this
clearly indicated Italy might leave
the league should the application of
sanctions be "too hostile." Whether
or not she does so, these sources as
sorted, she has clearly indicated she
will hold sanctionist countries "in
dividually responsible" for the ac
tions against her under the league
aegis.
Premier Mussolini and Sir Eric
Drummond, British Ambassador, ;
conferred for an hour today on
the Mediterranean situation. The
talks were understood to be "pro
gressing satisfactorily," but offi
cially there were no details.
