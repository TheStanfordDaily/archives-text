Turbulent days of California's
gold rush are depicted in
"Laughter Out of the Ground,"
a first novel by Robin Lamp
son, '23, who will read selec
tions from his work in the
Bookstore Thursday afternoon
from 2:30 to 4:30 o'clock.
Mr. Lampson comes naturally
by his interest in the gold rush.
Both his grandfathers came to
California during that period.
Mr. Lampson attended Stan
ford for three years and was a
member of the English Club.
In 1922 he went to Russia with
the Quaker famine relief or
ganization, and completed his
college work at the University
of California on his return.
He is a contributor to Scrib
ner's Magazine, The Literary
Digest, Modern Poetry, and
many other periodicals in the
United States, and The Poetry
Review and The Slavonic Re
view, two journals published in
London, England. He is also a
contributor to several anthol
ogies.
His published works include
"On Reaching Sixteen," a now
rare volume of verse published
in 1916, Terza-Rima Sonnets, a
book of lyrics just published by
Wilder Bentley's Archetype
Press at Berkeley, and his lat
est book, "Laughter Out of the
Ground."
