Here's John Meek, California quarter, taking the ball over the goal line to score a touchdown for the
Bears against Washington in their annual game at Berkeley. Floyd Blower, half, tossed the pigskin to
Meek, who is grabbing it between three Washington defenders, including Halfbacks Haines (29) and
Cain (62). Other players in the picture are Stockton (88), California; Shper (55), Wiatrak (13) and
C. Bond (72), all of Washington. The score was California, 14; Washington, 0. (Associated Press Photo)
