# Quad Staff Bags Snaps Of Grid Games, Squad
## 
### 
While Quad Editor Don Hanson
busied himself warning unphoto
graphed seniors to hop around to
the Woodpecker Lodge studio before
next Tuesday, staff photographers
Ernie Hartman, Don Gibson, and
Jack Beckett last week-end fol
lowed the grid team to Los Angeles,
snapped action shots of the game
with their new telephoto-lensed
cameras.
Used for the first time in Stanford
yearbook photography, the new tele
photo lens enables Quad photogra
phers to camera-catch action on the
football field from the top row of the
stadium, and then to develop the
exposed films into clear-cut, close-up
photographs actually showing the
player's facial expressions.
Prom the press box of the Los
Angeles Coliseum last Saturday,

Quad camera - hawks caught tho
speed and smash of the S.C. game
with new super-X, extra-fast films.
When the Indians a fortnight ago
jumped off the Washington game
special at the Palo Alio station, these
same modern camera methods made
it possible for Quad boys to perch
on the station's roof, take smiling
"candid camera" portraits of the re
turning players.
Editor Hanson, strong believer in
"candid" photography, has instructed
his photographers to snap action
photos right and left, promises that
the yearbook will be pack-jammed
with "ace photography."
