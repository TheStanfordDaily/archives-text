# Frosh Win 4, Lose 2, In Grid Play
## Only Losses To S.C. And Golden Bear Scribe Names Zagar, Fay Among Varsity Men For Next Season 
### Roger Kimball 
In .spite of losses to the U.S.C. and !
California frosh, Jimmy Bradshaw's i
Papoose football team completed a |
fairly successful season with the
Little Big Game Saturday. The Card
yearlings won their four other con- j
tests, and scored against both the |
Trobabes and the Bear Cubs.
Getting off to a good start against j
strong opponents, the Indian babes j
defeated Sacramento Junior College, |
7 to 0. Pete Zagar, star tackle, won
the game on a 45-yard run after in- |
tereepting a pass. The following Sat- j
unlay, Menlo's jaysees proved a set- !
up for the Thirty-niners to the tune
of 40 to 0. Wally deWitt's southpaw
passes contributed largely to the big |
frosh score.
First Trip to L.A.
On October 19, Bradshaw took his j
team on its first trip of the seasonâ€” j
to Los Angeles, whore the U.S.C. ;
first-year men downed Stanford's, j
19 to 7. Weak pass defense cost the
Indians this game, as the Trobabes I
could gain little ground through the J
Cardinal line. A 20-yard pass from
Jack Huebel to Andy Stojkovich, j
and a 58-yard run by the latter, gave J
Stanford its score in the linal period, j
/agar led his team to victory '
again as (lie Indian frosh con- !
qucrcd San Mateo Junior College,
!) to 0. in the peninsula city in the
next game. The high-scoring j
linesman blocked a Bulldog kick
and chased the hall over the goal
line, falling on it for a Stanford
touchdown. Ed Garnier's conver- j
sion and a safety completed the
scoring.
San Jose State's yearlings went j
down to a 22-0 defeat at the hands !
of the Stanford frosh in the icy cold I
of November 2. Scoring on Pete J
Fay's 20-yard dash, Wally deWitt's I
line plunge, and deWitt's run after I
an intercepted pass, as well as on an |
automatic safety, Bradshaw's team 1
looked only fair in the Little Big j
Game wind-up.
Lose to Bears
California's freshmen came to the
stadium as decided favorites Satur
day, and justified their position with !
a 12-7 victory over the Card babes
in the Little Big Game. The pass
ing combination of Vic Bottari to
Ned Thomas resulted in the first
Blue and Gold touchdown, and led
directly to the sceond.
Stanford, the better team in the
second half, scored on a pass from
deWilt to Don Butler, reserve end. j
Best prospects for next year's var
sity among the Thirty-niners include
deWitt at fullback, Bill Kirsch at
right half, Zagar at right tackle, and
Dick Sutton, center and defensive
lull. Pete Fay at left half, Ed Gar
nier at quarter, Andy Stojkovich at
light end, and Dave Carnahan at
left tackle also deserve mention for
consistently good play.
