With the round robin play in the
eight intramural football It-agues
completed, the competition moves
today into its final stage, that of
playing off for the university cham
pionship.
True to the new Stanford tradition
f close football games, the Alpha
Jolt-Breakers tussle yesterday saw
iit tie scoring but plenty of fine foot
ball before Alpha Delt emerged vic
torious with the League V cham
pionship safely under its shirt.
Dick Davis of the fraternity did
.'ill of the scoring of the afternoon.
His passing and running game pre
sent him as a strong candidate for
the all-intramural team. He scored
th<> Alpha Delt touchdown from the
three-yard line after a long drive,
then then kicked a perfect placement
conversion. Later Davis was caught
behind his own goal line attempting
tc. punt a bad pass from center.
