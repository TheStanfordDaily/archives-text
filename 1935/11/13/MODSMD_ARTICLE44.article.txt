S.M.I. PUT ON
FINE SHOW
Southern Methodist University —
we salute you. Not only because
you showed us what a real football
air circus looks like when you
swamped U.C.L.A. Monday, but also
because of your entire spirit. It was
a real credit to you.
Those of Stanford who went
southward for the U.S.C. game
were conscious of the fact that
S.M.U. was also represented in
Los Angeles that day. That gang
of Mustang followers, with their
ritzy little band, displayed a spirit
of confidence that seemed to say,
"We've got a ball club that will
show you birds of the Pacific
shores a thin}; or two." But they
didn't ever actually say it.
That's the way they seemed to be
—beat U.C.L.A. first, then talk about
it.
Sure, they knew that they had a
potent ball club. An undefeated and
untied season and only 12 points
scored against them made that fact
convincing.
And a 41-0 victory over George
Washington University at the na
tion's capital a week ago Satur
day was an example of their
strength. In that affair they threw
a mere 50 passes.
But they wanted to show us what
can really be done with a good pass
attack, an Monday they did it. They
threw 29 times, completed 17, and
had two intercepted, totaling 183
yards from passes. U.C.L.A. made 30
yards from passes.
Actually only one of the scores
was made on a pass. That, the first,
was chalked on a 27-yard throw
from Bob Finley to Mustang Cap
tain Maco Stewart.
In the fourth quarter S.M.U.
made her two other tallies, the first
by Finley who bucked the ball
over from the 3 after Bobby Wil
son. shining light of the Mustang"
hackficld, had completed six for
ward passes in a row.
The final touchdown was made a
moment later when those versatile
Texans intercepted a Bruin pass,
threw a lateral at just the opportune
time, and ran the ball some 35 yards
to score.
THEY'D LIKE
BOWL BID
Three weeks ago they publicly
announced their interest in the Rose
Bowl bid. Now, after proving their
mettle against coast football, and in
cidentally, making the coast look
pretty sick, the Lone Star sky rid
ers are real contenders for that Bowl
chance.
But as far as getting that bid is
concerned, the odds are stacked
against them. For the Texas team
being neither far east nor far west
is not a strong drawing card on the
coast despite its fine football
ability.
One of the major reasons for
holding a Rose Bowl game is the
financial angle. And it's improbable
that the Mustangs would draw the
same crowd a far eastern team
would, even if that latter squad were
somewhat weaker than S.M.U.
