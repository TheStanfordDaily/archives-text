# Bruins Have Slight Edge Over Stanford Tankmen
## 
### 
When title-seeking Bruin water
poloists clash with Stanford Satur
day morning for the second time this
season, they will find the going any
thing but easier than it was last
week when they triumphed 5-3 over
the Indians.
Coach Nort Thornton's Cardi
nal tanksters even have high hopes
of routing the mighty Uelans, thus
avenging the recent Stanford de
feat and gaining at least a tie for
the Pacific Coast Conference title.
That Saturday's tussle should pro
vide plenty of thrills for Farm water
polo enthusiasts is of little doubt.
For within the Bruins' grasp this
week-end is the undisputed Coast
championship. All they need is a
single victory, against either the In
dians or California, both of whom
they have drubbed before.
From ali indications, then, the
Farm fracas should he a toss-up
from start to finish. The firuins
mermen, according to past per
formances and scores, have a
slight edge over the Berkeley
Bears, whom they arc scheduled to
tangle with Friday afternoon, hut
they are far from heavily favored
to defeat the Indians Saturday j
morning.
The highly-touted Uelans, should
they overcome the Berkeleyites as J
expected, will be officially rewarded !
with league title. But that will de
tract not one bit of interest from the
Indian -Bruin battle, for a Cardinal
win Saturday would boost Stanford's '

rating to a tie with U.C.L.A. for the
conference lead.
