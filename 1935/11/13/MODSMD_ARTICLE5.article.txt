# Lasswell Talks On Propaganda
## 
### 
"Propaganda can be made ally
rather than enemy, even in a de
mocracy," concluded Harold D. Lass
well, professor of political science at
the University of Chicago, and au
thority in the field of public opinion,
in his lecture last evening in the
Assembly Hall.
Although it can be dangerous in
that "people get fed up with gov
ernment by talk, especially in
democracies and the probability
of their resorting to violence in
creases," I)r. Lasswell said the best
method of control of propaganda
is to use it to further one's own
preferences. To say "there ought
to be a law" accomplishes noth
ing, for statutes cannot be passed
which can regulate or modify
propaganda.
Dr. Lasswell explained the mod
ern techniques of making propa
ganda, pointing out that indirect in
sinuations, as is done in political car
toons, are effective where direct ar
gument will fail. The speaker also
said that propaganda is used not only
in national and international politics,
but there is scarcely a hospital, a
university, or an industry in the
country which hasn't a public rela
tions counsel.
