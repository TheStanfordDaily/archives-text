# Fraternities, on Own Iniative, Move Toward Sensible Pledge Week System
## 
### 
As Stanford's twentv-t'our fraternities for
the most part were looking back at a sane,
civilized Pledge Week and looking forward to
pledging Class of '39 "nuggets," Interfratcr
nity Council President Ed Littlefield last
night praised the houses on the success of the
Farm's new method of initiating neophytes,
which was tried this year for the lirst time.
Lilllcfield said that no violations of the
agreement, signed last spring J>y all of the
Creek organizations, which outlawed the ob
pectionahle features of Hell Week, had been
reported, and that "no complaints whatever"
had been made.
He added that there probably will be no
changes made in the wording of the agree
ment, which is phrased in general terms, but
that future changes will be in interpretation
and enforcement by the Inter!''raternily Board
as spccilic cases arise.
Stanford's present system provides that all
pre-initiation activity will lake place entirely
within the individual houses, and that nothing
•will be done that will permanently injure the
pledges' health or scholastic standing.
My establishing this sensible method of
initialing sophomores, the Farm became one

of the leaders in a nation-wide anti Hell Week
trend among college fraternities. Stanford's
How, however, acted more wisely than did the
Creeks at many colleges, since the fraternities
themselves abolished the uncivilized practices
that formerly characterized initiations, while
faculty and administrative action was respon
sible for the change among the brother chap
ters at many universities.
Fraternities suffered theii greatest "black
eye" in the "whoopee" pre-depression days
when their roughhoiise tactics were at their
peak. Since then, the public eye has viewed
Hell Week practices with increasing alarm,
and publicity given specific incidents has
caused a general demand that this form of
hazing be done away with; hence the estab
lishment, faculty-sponsored in many cases, of
milder initiations.
I he lack of adverse criticism of Farm pre
initiation periods this year indicates good co
operation under the new system, and as long
as Stanford fraternities show the degree of
common sense they have shown during the
recent round of Pledge Weeks, they need har
bor no fears of administration "cracking
down" such as that which has greeted their
brothers in inanv oilier colleges.

As Stanford's twentv-t'our fraternities for
the most part were looking back at a sane,
civilized Pledge Week and looking forward to
pledging Class of '39 "nuggets," Interfratcr
nity Council President Ed Littlefield last
night praised the houses on the success of the
Farm's new method of initiating neophytes,
which was tried this year for the lirst time.
Lilllcfield said that no violations of the
agreement, signed last spring J>y all of the
Creek organizations, which outlawed the ob
pectionahle features of Hell Week, had been
reported, and that "no complaints whatever"
had been made.
He added that there probably will be no
changes made in the wording of the agree
ment, which is phrased in general terms, but
that future changes will be in interpretation
and enforcement by the Inter!''raternily Board
as spccilic cases arise.
Stanford's present system provides that all
pre-initiation activity will lake place entirely
within the individual houses, and that nothing
•will be done that will permanently injure the
pledges' health or scholastic standing.
My establishing this sensible method of
initialing sophomores, the Farm became one

of the leaders in a nation-wide anti Hell Week
trend among college fraternities. Stanford's
How, however, acted more wisely than did the
Creeks at many colleges, since the fraternities
themselves abolished the uncivilized practices
that formerly characterized initiations, while
faculty and administrative action was respon
sible for the change among the brother chap
ters at many universities.
Fraternities suffered theii greatest "black
eye" in the "whoopee" pre-depression days
when their roughhoiise tactics were at their
peak. Since then, the public eye has viewed
Hell Week practices with increasing alarm,
and publicity given specific incidents has
caused a general demand that this form of
hazing be done away with; hence the estab
lishment, faculty-sponsored in many cases, of
milder initiations.
