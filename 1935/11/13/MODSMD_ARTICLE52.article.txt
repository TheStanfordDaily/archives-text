# When Is a Tradition? If So, Why or Why Not?

Hull Scssioner, in an adjoining column,
finds that students'are turning from tradi
tions to more serious forms of endeavor. He
fails to realize however that there is nothing
more serious than traditions.
Granted that the average collegian now
cares little for mass monkey-shines and mob
rah-rahism, no argument against traditions is
so raised. The Save-Our-Traditions move
ment is not designed to make anyone wear his
pajamas outdoors, yell himself hoarse, or
splinter his lingers working on the Big Game
bonfire if he is not so inclined.
The frivolous customs, sometimes loosely
clased with and called traditions, may come
or go with the temper of the times and no one
will be seriously alTecled. lint to let the more
serious traditions—honor code, a smokeless
Quad, ride-bumming, hello-saying—go by the
boards, is to let the living Stanford die.
It the desire is to let Stanford slip back to
mediocrity, wherein it can no longer be dis
tinguishable from a host of the less distinc
tive fry, then letting new generations he un
informed as to traditions is a shortcut to
success.
But there are many who appreciate Stan
lord and want to perpetuate it. Realizing that
traditions are the backbone of a distinctive
Stanford, known for its democracy, its gentle
manliness, its friendliness, they are not will
ing to let the worthwhile traditions be
thoughtlessly dropped.
Hence the appeal to Stanford gentlemen to
uphold the Honor Code, light no cigarettes on
Quad, pick up fellow students, discounte
nance unlair election tactics and various
forms of display. The appeal is not, then, to
save frivolity which may 110 longer appeal, but
to save traditions which relied the better as
pects of human nature that are part of Stan
ford, that are deemed worthy by any genera
lion.
