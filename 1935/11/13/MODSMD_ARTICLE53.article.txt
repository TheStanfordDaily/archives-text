# One Form of Culture Lags At "Harvard of the West"
## 
### 
Stanford's nrw Memorial Hall, now under
construction, will go one step farther in e
lahlishing Stanford as the cultural school of
the West hv adding to the importance of
drama and the theater as a college curricu
lum. Ktnphasis on drama conse(|iiently will
approach that given to literature, history,

social sciences, ami other courses of study
whose stress is on cultural rather than tech
nical training.
In the meantime, however, several other
phases of culture are lading in the Stanford I
programâ€”namely, art and music. A program i
is now under way to develop the University's !
art department, hut there have been no signs
of change in the altogether inadequate em
phasis given music.
In the Announcement of Courses, only three j
music courses, aside from band, orchestra,
and choir, are listed. Even as an extra-cur
ricular activity, music holds a much less im
portant place at Stanford than it does at many
Western universities. The. glee clubs and
orchestra do not ocupy the positions they '
should; the band, at least partly because of
its "stepped-on" position among campus ac
tivities, does not compare with the U.S.C.
band, or with the "red-hots" of Southern
Met hodist.
Memorial Hall, already counted upon to
boost dramatics at Stanford, could step far
ther into the cultural field and serve as an
impetus to the development of a more ade
quate music department. This new theater
will furnish better facilities for certain phases
ol music than heretofore have been provided,
and it would be wise for the "Harvard of the
West" to make use of them.
