## TRADITIONS: CAN WE SALVAGE THEM? 
### 
Time was when the bonfire and helloing, pajama
rinos and dinks, were articles of faith for Stanfordites.
Prospective freshmen accepted them while still in high
school and aiming in only a general way for the Farm.
Once in Encina, and through four years, they held to
the idiosyncracies of Stanford life with an almost re
ligious fanaticism and looked at the non-believer with
accusing eyes.

Today tears and heart-throbs from grads, typo
graphical and oral promotion from old-hands, don't
bother Stanford men and women at all. A significant
number of freshmen studied their individual lessons,
followed their individual star, instead of joining in
the collective pajamarino a few nights ago.
And their study lights in Encina that pricked the
din-filled night told more eloquently lhan words what
has happened to Stanford men, and what will happen
to Farm traditions at their hands.
For many Stanfordites, once content to take the
joyous nonsense of their college in stride, to submerge
individual personalities in ordained rat-races, now
hold themselves oil as individuals, work for their
individual aims, training for the dog-eat-dog-game of
adult life during the few years which might be for
hem a sort of an oasis of collective activity.

Gifted more than any class with means of finding
out about the world and its ways, many of them per
ceive clearly that some college traditions are essen
tially nonsensical.
Not old enough to be healthily serious nor health
ily playful, they have the failing of the self-absorbed:
They chnnot stand ridicule. And because some of the
Farm's traditional carnivals mean ridicule for the in
dividual, though sympathetic and harmless ridicule,
they would rather avoid the pain of being silly, and
sit at home to nurse their future.

Small wonder then that such self-effacement as a
mass activity requires holds no lure for many of Stan
ford's newer crop. They see more dollar-for-dollar
value, more ability to close with the economic arch
devils of adult life, in what the test-book says. In
stead of living and learning in the college world as
they were meant to, they would rather sit alone, suck
ling their infant destines with the prc-occupation of a
bear suckling her cubs. —Bob Eisenbach
