# RALLY WAS BAD TOO
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Nuts and dried up raisins to some
one in the long line of rally com
mittee stooges who was responsible
for keeping a large group of gen
uine and enthusiastic Stanford root
ters from entering their own section,
when several of the front rows still
remained empty.
This prize "butch" occurred Satur
day in Los Angeles, when quite a
handful of Stanford students had to
sit on the minus ten-yard line for
most of the first quarter.
If we hadn't come all the way
from the Farm to see the game; if
the section hadn't been full; and, if
if hadn't been padded with a smat
tering of bald heads and strange
faces, the situation would have been
at least excusable.
Perhaps a little "heads-up ball"
might be of benefit to the rally com
mittee.
