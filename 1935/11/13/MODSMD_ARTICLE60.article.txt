# WHAT TO DO?
## 
### 
i The Editor, Sir:
Why can't some arrangement be
made to permit students that have
I had the misfortune of losing their
student body cards to buy rooters
1 tickets to the Big Game?
My card was stolen a short time
I ago, and when I tried to buy a ticket
to the Cal game I was turned down.
I had a certificate of registration to
prove lhat I was a student; yet this
i was not enough.
Is the B.A.C. afraid of losing two
or three times $1.G5? This rule is
certainly not conducive to honesty,
1 for the school knows that I will try
every means possible to get into the
game with another student's card or
some other devious means. I have
paid $115 for seven quarters now—
isn't this enough to permit me the
privilege of being a rooter Novem
ber 23, in spite of a misfortune that
happened through no fault of my
own.
I am making this appeal, not only
for myself, but for several other stu
dents that will probably be sitting
beside a radio or down between the
goal posts unless we can concoct
some dishonest scheme to sit with
the rest of the Stanford men and
women.
Why not give us a chance to sec
this great game legitimately?
