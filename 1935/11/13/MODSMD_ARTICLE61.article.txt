The Editor, Sir:
Some of the people of Palo Alto
must have had a great disappoint
ment today when the latest Stanford
"criminal" had his case dismissed
from court. It was a competent law
yer's advice that a jury trial would
be a safe thing for the student to
ask for because it was doubtful if
any jury would believe that the
arresting officer had such keen eyes
and ears to detect just what student
was making the noise from where the
officer was sitting.

| In view of the fact that the Stan- !
: ford Theater does not wish officers
j to arrest their patrons so promiscu-
I ously, that the student arrested has
: nevertheless had his fingerprints sent !
! to the criminal records, and that the j
i only objecting patrons of the theater
1 were a few Palo Alto busy-bodies, I
| suggest that the student body not
| give up the fight to have their free
j dom in the local theaters of express
i ing their approval or disapproval of
j any pictures shown.
