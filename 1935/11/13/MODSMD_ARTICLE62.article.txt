# NOT RECKLESS DRIVERS
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
My apologies to "A Non-Ticketed
Driver" for having conveyed a wrong
impression. I did not mean to con- j
done reckless driving.
My contention simply was lhat
some people are better drivers than
others and would therefore endan- I
ger society less at any given speed.
I merely meant to suggest that this
rather obvious fact be given legal
recognition.
And this does not mean I have
never deserved a ticket.
