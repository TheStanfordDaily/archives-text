! "COMMON FLESH"
At the Columbia, S.F.
This is the sort of play that cries
for the Rough's God-given right to
boo! It's just a great big mess of
i guff.
The play drags; the actors stalk
about the stage delivering would-be
I funny lines with all the subtlety of a
Joe Humphries; and the heroine
makes passionate love in the Theda
! Bara style.
The story is that of a husky-voiced
I floozy who tricks the seion of a
| well-known New England family
| into marriage. Of course it doesn't
work out, and she finally goes crazy
; in the most hoked-up scene to tread
; the S.F. boards in many moons.
: Mary Arden, who plays the dame,
: and Hugh McArthur, who takes the
! juvenile role, are the only half-way
decent actors in the show.
If this bo the legitimate drama,
i God save the stage!
