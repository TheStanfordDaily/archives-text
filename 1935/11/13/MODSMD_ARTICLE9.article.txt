### Art Stokes 
Overwhelming 22 write-in oppon
ents in the fall's second A.S.S.U.
election, Jack Hanson yesterday was
confirmed as graduate man on Ex
Committee.
In the freshman election, held
jointly with the Ex Committee
vote, John M. Fuller was named
president of the Class of '119 and
Florence Brown was chosen as sec
retary-treasurer by a wide margin.
All three successful candidates, ac
cording to Jim Ludlam, Election
Board chairman, led throughout on
first choice, although under the pref
erential system second and third
choices also are tallied.
Out of a total of 656 freshmen,
250 cast ballots, while of approxi
mately .'{7oo eligible for the A.S.
S.U. vote, only 407 votes were
cast. Ludlam said, 2,775 ballots
were printed for the election. The
14 per cent A.S.S.U. vote was as
cribed chiefly to the fact only one
candidate was nominated for the
Ex Committee post. Fifty-seven
A.S.S.U. and 18 freshmen ballots
were rejected because they were
improperly marked.
Hanson, appointed to the Ex Com
mittee post last month after Bill
Stark resigned, received 303 votes
yesterday. His nearest opponent,
John Gallagher, received 20 votes,
Jim Massey received 4, and the other
20 candidates were accorded scat
tering ballots.
Votes for the three highest can
didates for the freshman offices
were:
President: Fuller 120; Chet Stearns
103; Sam Mattison 39.
Secretary - treasurer: Florence
Brown 121; Didi Vibert 72; Elizabeth
Verheyen 54.
There were six other presidential
candidates and five others sought the
second class office.
Election Board members who
conducted the election included Lud
lam, Jackie Brown, Paul Wallis,
Eetle Brock, Esther Pclton, Bob
Clark, Helen Zwick. Bud Lesser, Sid
Forman, Priscilla Merwin, Guy
Neely, and Jane Offield.
