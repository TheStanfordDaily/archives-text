# Army Centers Movement On Jijiga Border
## Ethiopians To Strengthen Strategic City To Resist Attack Woman, Child Killed Duce Plans Anti-Sanction Policy for Powers

ADDIS ABABA, Nov. 13 (/P). â€”
The Ethiopian government charged
today that ati Italian pilot had
wounded a woman and a child when
he dropped six bombs on Daggah
Bur, 100 miles south af Jijiga.
A report that Fascist pilots had
made their first scouting expedi
tion over Jijiga, which dominates
Ethiopia's routes to the sea, caused
concern here for the safety of the
t'ly.
Emperor Haile Selassie is planning
a strong defense of Jijiga. He re
cently sent 40,000 warriors there to
supplement the local garrison. A
large number of machine guns also
were reported sent to the town.
Jijiga's importance lies in the
fact that highways from British
Somaliland lead into it and, al
though it is not on the railroad
from Djibouti to Addis Ababa, its
capture would place the Italians in
a strong position to cut off the
railway.
