## Chief Executive Suggests Lowered Rates To Prod Recovery 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 13 (/P). —
Bankers received from President
Fioosevelt today a pointed sugges
tion that interest rates be slashed to
prod recovery.
The chief executive said, in reply
to press conference questions, that
he certainly wanted interest rates
lower than (5 per cent, but would
not give a more exact figure.
He pictured easier money as an
important factor in bringing the
powerful lever of large bank re
serves into greater play in the re
covery drive.
Coincides with Convention
Perhaps by coincidence, the ques
tion of bank charges for loans was
laised and the president's views
given at a time when the American
Bankers' Association was in conven
tion in New Orleans.
There, severe criticism was be
ing raised against some phases of
the new deal, particularly heavy
borrowing for relief spending.
Mr. I?oosevelt gave no intimation
that he expected ihe government to
take action to force cheaper money.
Government Sets Pace
Some observers drew the inference
that he looked rather toward mov
ing in this direction through the
example of lower interest charges
by government agencies.
The Reconstruction Corporation
has been charging from OV2 to 5
per cent for money; the Home Own
ers' Loan Corporation figure was 5
per cent, and the Federal Housing
Administration guarantees no loan
bearing more than 5 per cent.
