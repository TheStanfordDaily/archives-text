# Dramatics Club Gives Reading
## Clark, Bailey Outstanding In 'Merry Wives' 
### Phil Bernheim 
Fred Clark's Ford proved the out
standing character in the Sword and
Sandals reading of "The Merry
Wives of Windsor" in the Little The
ater last night, though Shakespeare
meant Sir John Falstaff to be.
Shakespeare loses much when read
instead of acted. It was chiefly be
cause many of the actors failed to
get their lines over without stage
business that last night's reading
was not top rank.
George Wood, who played Fal
staff, failed to give much feeling
of the hearty, obese old rascal that
Sir John is. In fact, few of the actors
showed much feeling for the play.
Because he did manage to give
fairly full moaning to the lines, Clark
was outstanding.
Among the feminine members of
the cast, Dr. Margery Bailey was, as
usual, outstanding.
Sydney Head's direction was too
fast to let the many plays on words,
some of which are now obscure,
sink in.
Over a dozen students and several
faculty members took part.
