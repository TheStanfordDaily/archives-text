# Students Find More Value in Rest Homes
## 
### 
Less than 30 patients in each dur
ing the first yearâ€”more than 200 last
year; thus has the number of patients
cared for in the Men's and Wom
en's Rest Homes increased since they
began in 1928.
In Stanford's early days the
"middlin' ill" had to depend upon
a kind invitation from some pri
vate home or else go to the hospital.
Finally the Mothers' Club agreed
to experiment with rest homes
where the students could go with
out great expense.
For the first year the mothers suc
cessfully sponsored the idea them
selves. Since then they have pro
vided the equipment. The patient
pays one-third of his expense, and
the administration two-thirds.

More students clamor for ad
mittance than ran Iw accepted.
Perhaps it is the food, or it may be'
the soothing hack-rub before going
to sleep at night, but the ten
places in the Men's Rest Home and
the six in the Women's are not
sufficient to accommodate the
growing student body. So Mrs.
L. J. Owen, who cares for the
women, and Mrs. Louise Benedict
of the Men's Rest Home are hop
ing for new buildings.
Stanford's unique hospitalization
system has been widely and favor
ably commented upon. "The suc
cess of the rest homes," says Mrs.
Owen, "is due to the co-operation
given by the Palo Alto Hospital, by
the students, and by campus organ-
I izations."
