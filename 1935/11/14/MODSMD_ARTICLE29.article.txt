# Quad To Close Senior Section
## 
### 
The 1936 Quad's senior picture stu- |
dio positively will close at 5 o'clock
next Tuesday!
This ultimatum came last night j
from Editor Don Hanson, in re
sponse to cries from the annual's en- !
gravers in San Francisco for the
yearbook staff to rush the pictures
to them to be made into cuts.
Almost 200 seniors still remain un
photographed. Into the mails last
night went reminder post cards to
each of them. Hanson warned that ;
it is no "bluff," that seniors whose
photographs have not been taken by j
Tuesday night will not be pictured !
in the Quad.
