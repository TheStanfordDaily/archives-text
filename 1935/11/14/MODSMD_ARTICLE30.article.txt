# Austria Weakening In Pro-Italy Policy
## 
### 
VIENNA, Nov. 13 (/P). â€”Indications
I increased today that the Austrian
! policy of refusing to participate in
j sanctions against Italy was encoun-
J tcring strong internal opposition.
| M;my quarters opposed committing
j Austria to such a pronounced pro
j Italian policy.
It was this feeling which was con
-1 sidered responsible for the forceful
j assertion of Foreign Minister Agon
1 B(.rger-Waldenogg in the Diet yes
j terday that Austria's stand on sanc
tions was unchanged.
