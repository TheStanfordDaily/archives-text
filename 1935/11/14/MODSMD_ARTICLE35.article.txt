# Indians To Face Crucial Test In Montana Battle
## Previous Performances Point to Unforeseen Grizzly Power Reserve Team Chosen Todd, Trompas, Reisner To See Action

When Tiny Thornhill and A1 Mas
ters got together last year and fig
ured out Stanford's 1935 football
schedule it was probably their inten
tion to schedule for November 16—
the week before the annual Big
Game—something of a breather.
Montana, it scents, was to be
that breather. At best it was ex
pected to offer nothing more than
a brisk workout for the Indians.
But now it comes to light that
those hard luck-hounded Grizzlies
hid fair to furnish anything hut
that.
The Montanans, from all reports,
will go into Saturday's fracas as con
fident and as fully determined to
win as they have been in every tilt
thus far this season, from the Mon-

tana State battle to the Washington
Husky fray—and an outfit that ab
solutely refuses to be the underdog
is always dangerous. What's more,
past performances indicate that this
particular ball club is doubly dan
gerous, although the Grizzlies have
collected but a single victory this
year.
It was Montana that battered fu
ture chances for Southern Califor
nia. True, the Trojans won 9-0, but
the walls of Troy are only now be
ing rebuilt. Montana led a highly
touted Washington State aggrega
tion for 57 minutes of their battle
at Missoula until the Cougars,
streaming fresh reserves into the
line-up in the closing minutes of
the tilt, pushed over the winning
touchdowns against a limping band
of Grizzlies.
Against the Washington Huskies,
although lacking in reserve power
they scored a touchdown before the
fracas was five minutes old and had
the Washingtonians constantly back
ing up against their goal line to
avert another tally during the first
period.
By the third quarter, however,
the starting linc-up that had taken
no little punishment for about
45 minutes was beginning to weak
en and was finally beaten down by
superior man power of the Hus
kies. Although the final count
read 33-7, an overwhelming de
feat for Montana, Coach Jimmy
Phclan's charges had been given
the scare of their lives.
Thus the Missoula maulers have
earned their reputation. Their op
ponents, no matter how highly rated,
have all made a habit of remember
ing Montana for in every case this
season the Grizzlies have left them
with a bunch of physically and men
tally weakened gridsters.
Pessimistic as it sounds, Stan
ford can be no exception against
Montana's forces of combat. The
score may not suffer, but with the
grid warriors themselves it's quite
another matter. Injuries, the dread
of any ball club, must be con
stantly guarded against.
