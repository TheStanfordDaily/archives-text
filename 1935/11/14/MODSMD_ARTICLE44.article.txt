# MAKE 'EM PEPPIER
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
As to last Thursday's SC. rally:
why do we have skits? They are not
clever—at least, most of them aren't
—they take a long time and everyone
is bored. The other night the team
could hardly keep from yawning and
the students were very restless.
These skits take up too much
time. Isn't half an hour long enough
for a rally: one or two pep talks and
many yells and songs? After all,
their purpose is to promote spirit;
whereas, dry and boring skits are
the surest way to depress anyone.
Here's for shorter and peppier
rallies. . . .
