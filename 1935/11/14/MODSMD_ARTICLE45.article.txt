# TRY GETTING TOGETHER

The Editor, Sir:
, From various articles appearing in
the Stanford Daily, I gather that
Palo Alto, like the majority of col
lege towns, is run primarily for the
students' pleasure, and that the only
possible reason any other individual
should attend the theaters is to watch
the "Rough" bird the pictures and,
perhaps, if he is lucky, hear some of
these classic remarks.
I am convinced, as you say, that
this booing, etc., is his "prerogative
, and joy"' and that he would much
rather engage in cat-calls than wit
ness a good picture, but in case I am
wrong, may I offer this suggestion?
Why not have some of your crit-
I ics and any others who are so eager
| to express their opinions during pic
-1 tures meet with the manager of the
local theater or theaters and select
1 the next playbill? Then, perhaps,
when they pick a poor one, they will
be gentlemen enough to leave. For
remember, everyone in attendance is
| capable of liking or disliking a pic
| ture without any coaching from any

one else and, not only that, pay 40
cents a throw for the privilege.
