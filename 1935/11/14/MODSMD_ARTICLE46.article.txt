# DESCRIBING THE "BIRD"
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Permit me to quote from the Paly
Times a policeman's reasons for ar
lesting a Stanford student at a re
cent movie: "Recounting the incident,
Officer Bun Hickey . . . stated thai
'at different intervals the serenity
of the audience was ruptured by
an obnoxious noise which emanated
from the direction of Mr.
"The said Mr. , according to
the officer, 'craned his neck for
ward, pursed his lips, and sibilantly
sucked inward with one side of
his mouth' to the disadvantage of
the peace and dignity of the people
of California. 'The result reminded
me tii' a person who was extraordi
narily sucking his teeth. The sound
also was very much like some kind
of a bird call.' "
