# WHAT KIND OF WAR?
## 
### 
i One hears a good deal these days, j
l particularly from leftist regions, !
about opposition to war. Much of 1
such opposition, however, seems to |
betray a singular lack of discrimiria- !
| tion. Judging by the anti-war propa
ganda which has come my way of
, late, war seems to be thought of as
a sort of horrible phenomenon, to
the same degree feolish and unjus
tified at all times, in all places, t and
with regard to all who engage in it.
Such an attitude completely over
looks two basic facts.
The first tine of these is that war !
can be profitable, to the victor at i
least (vide the Franco-Prussian j
war). True, the last war did not
profit any of the major powers, but |
, who can say that it would not have J
done so had Germany emerged as j
! lord of Middle Europe. It may be
! early to say that ihere is 110 longer j
1 national profit in war.
The second fact to be remembered i
1 is that if self-defense is justifiable,
1 some wars are justified from the l
1 standpoint of one of the parties to j
j them. It is of course perfectly pos- j
sible upon grounds of Christian
meekness to believe in turning the
other cheek under all circumstances.
Unless one so believes, however, it I
I seems foolish to confound aggres- j
! sion and defense. To place upon one '
| plane of moral justification the Ger- i
man invasion of Belgium, for ex- j
ample, and Belgian resistance there- |
to, is to say that land and water are 1
| the same thing, and to sum up one's
j attitude toward both in the state- I
ment that one does not approve of 1
I mud.
It seems to me that we are en
titled to ask of those who are against
war, "What sort of a war are you (
! against? Do you really mean that
you are against all war, abjure all
military imperialism, howsoever
tempting, and believe in nonresist
ance to any oppression, however
: great?"

It seems to me that we are en
titled to ask of those who are against
war, "What sort of a war are you (
! against? Do you really mean that
you are against all war, abjure all
military imperialism, howsoever
tempting, and believe in nonresist
ance to any oppression, however
: great?"
