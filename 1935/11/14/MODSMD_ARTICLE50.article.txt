# Cards Prepare For Water Polo Invasion By Unbeaten Bruins
## Tanksters Seek To Upset Uclans' Title Chance' 
### 
Intensive daily workouts on the
part of Stanford's varsity water polo
ists during the past week have
served to add even more heat to an
already warm reception planned for
the undefeated Bruins who will
clash with Coach Nort Thornton's
Indians Saturday morning at 11
o'clock.
The U.C.L.A. tanksters, within a
period of two weeks, first whipped
their big brothers from Berkeley
and then subdued the Cardinals
to gain a lead in the raee for the
Pacific Coast Conference cham
pionship. This week-end the
mighty Uclans head northward in
quest of the title that lies within
their grasp for the first time.
Coach AI Dowden's Golden Bears
play host to the Westwoodites Fri
day afternoon at Berkeley, and if
California is to remain as a con
tender for the Coast intercollegiate
crown the Bears must triumph over
the Bruins, who need but a single
victory this week-end to win the
same title. If the Los Angeles Cali
fornians drop the tilt to the Berkeley
Californians and then are defeated
by Stanford Saturday, the Iwo north
ern aggregations would then battle
it out for top honors next week
when the Indians tangle with Cali
fornia.
Stanford, then, is not out of the
picture by any means and Thorn
ton's mermen arc quite aware of
(hat fact. Their fast-breaking,
short-passing attack should func
tion more effectively in their home
tank Saturday than it did when
they were nosed out in a smaller
pool at Westwood last week.
If pre-game dope is indicative, a
real toss-up should be staged in
Encina Pools when the Bruins in
vade the Indians' stronghold Satur
day.
