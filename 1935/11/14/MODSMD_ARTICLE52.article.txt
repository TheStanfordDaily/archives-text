Two games of the intramural
j championship were played yester
| day, and after the dust and divots
i had settled to the turf Fiji remained
! in the play after having eliminated
I Kappa Sig, and Chi Psi kept its rec
' old clean by a victory over Phi Delt.
The Fiji-Kappa Sig game was a
! loose one at first, with both squads
I showing nervousness in many off-
I .sides and shaky pass play. Bill New
! som's passing was, together with
| Laury Bayer's splendid kick-offs, the
j high-light of the game. Newsom
j passed 25 yards to Bayer for one
j score in the first half, and passed to
| Lee Irelan for a gain of 35 yards and
| a touchdown in the second period.
The other game seemed Phi Delt
j all except the last ten minutes. Dur
! ing that period the Chi Psis revived
j enough to march 70 yards in three
| plays, and score on a pass from
j Howard Clark to Giff Myers. Both
| conversions failed.
| When the game ended in a 6-6
i deadlock, both teams were given five
| plays, during which time Ed Little
j field made a 35-yard run which the
j Phi Delts could not make up, and
j which gave Chi Psi the game.
