MONTANA—SMALL
BUT NOT AFKAII)
Saturday Stanford meets one of
I the fightingest little football teams
I in the Northwest — Montana. For
j years the Grizzlies have fought an
j uphill battle for a place among the
| Conference greats. And for years
• they have awakened to find all efforts
j were for naught—that again they are
either in, or near, the cellar.
! Two months ago the 1!)35 season
looked great for Montana and her
new coach, Doug Fessendcn. That
was when there were all of 42 men
; out, but among them some mighty
: fine footballers.
It's changed now. The Grizzlies
! have just 26 men who can take the
j field to fight for their "copper, silver,
j and gold." And Ihey've lost every
j game but one.
> But the fact that their squad is
j small and that their "won and lost"
j record isn't good still hasn't made
I them think of the word "quit."
i Every one of their games except
1 the Montana State affair, which they
] won, has been a near victory, but not
I quite enough. Down at Los Angeles
j they stole the show from U.S.C. but
I lost to the Trojans 9-0.
They lost that game, just as
; they have the others, on one big
! point. There are really only about
j a dozen men who play top-notch
j football. They aren't iron. They
! wear out in the last half. And the
big teams push in fresh reserves to
i score on the fagged Grizzlies.
LACK OF RESERVES
LOST FOR GRIZZLIES
That's what happened when they
led Washington State for 57 min
utes with the score 7-6. Then in the
closing minutes in streamed the re
serves and away went the ball game,
14-7.
I Against Idaho they lost in the
final minutes again: Score 14-7.
1 Their best effort came the follow
ing week when they scared Jimmy
Phelan's Washington Huskies al
most out of their hides by scoring
early in the game and holding
tight to that lead for the remain
der of the first half.
But in came the fresh team and up
! went the score until late in the
. fourth quarter Washington corn

| pletely routed the Grizzlie forces to
end the game 33-7.
Against Stanford it should be
the same thing. Tiny will prob
ably keep some of his first string
ers out of the starting line-up just
to see what color the affair takes.
If the Grizzlies aren't too ferocious,
he'll undoubtedly play many of the
reserves.
But if Montana pulls another first
half scare as it did against the Hus
kies, Stanford may not be deprived
of its weekly thrill. The Indians will
have to be on their guard, but there's
! no denying it —Stanford should win
without too great difficulty.
! Where the Cards are liable to catch
I it in the neck is not by score, but by
injuries. As has been pointed out,
Montana fights. And Stanford can't
j afford to lose anyone at this pre
; carious point. —Frost.
