# Grays Ready For Rambler Game
## Berkeleyites Favorites In Annual Game Cardinals Winners of Last Year's 12-6 Battle 
### Roger Kimball 
Preparing to meet a team which
has turned back all opponents this
season, the Stanford Grays will en
gage in light signal drill today and
tc. morrow. Coached by Murray
Cuddeback and Husky Hunt, the
"second varsity" will tangle with the
powerful California Ramblers at
11:30 o'clock Saturday morning in
ihc- Memorial Stadium at Berkeley
as a preliminary to the California-
College of Pacific fracas.
The Blue and Gold jayvees
smothered Marin Junior College,
-17 to 0, in their most recent vic
tory. As the Mariners are in the
same league as Sail Mateo Junior
College, and have a team of about
the same strength, the Ramblers
will be heavy favorites over the
Grays.
Stanford's Grays won this Big
Game of the substitutes last year by
a 12-6 margin, after stopping the
Bctrs three .times within the Card
10-yard line. The Ramblers are
coached by Jimmy Hole, a clever
strategist who formerly coached
Berkeley High School teams. Be
sides the Marin walkaway, their
record includes a 14-13 triumph over
the San Diego Marines in the
southern city, and a win over Fresno
State's varsity.
Cuddeback will probably start an
eleven composed of the following
men: ends, Clark and Chouteau;
tackles, Ferko and McKinney;
guards, Pinnell and Brigham; center,
Heath; quarterback, Holdridge; half
backs, Hoos and Madlem; fullback,
Carter.
