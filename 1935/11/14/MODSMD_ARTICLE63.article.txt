# "Let the Winds of Freedom Blow"
## Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily Member of the Associated Press Police Chief Seems To Go Too Far In Treating Theater Booers as Criminals 
### 
Letters to the editor raise the rather obvious
point that it's not especially funny to be
thrown into the local bastille for merely voic
ing displeasure at a show.
Another letter from San Jose berates Stan
ford men for their miserable manners, claim
ing they're all boors in shows anyway. His
point is well taken beyond a point, booing
does become offensive. At the same time, it
is more probable that most booing is directed
at "prc-vues" of coming attractions, punk
comedies, and asinine news-reel shots that
few enjoy anyway.
I! booing or other disturbances become too
marked in the middle of a feature someone
is sincerely trying to enjoy, the right of asking
an usher or manager to evict or warn the sus
pected offender still exists. This right has
been invoked many times in the past, and the
theater staff is always only too anxious to act
in this particular line of duty.
Hut such just action seems to bear slight
relationship to Chief Zink's jailing and finger
printing suspected offenders who may be en
tirely innocent. As one letter to the editor
points out, it may even be illegal for the chief
to decide what is tragic and what is comic. At
any rale, he is hardly raising the prestige of
his force by picking on such minor nuisances,
and he is making the local theaters about as
lively as a mausoleum bv his intimidations.

With this number doubled, prospective can
didates necessarily would be more certain of
their chances in an election, according to the
difficulty encountered in securing signatures;
■ hence, there would be fewer nominations,
■ and those who draw an insignificant number
i of votes for the most part would be eliminated.
