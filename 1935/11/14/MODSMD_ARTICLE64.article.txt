# How Can Frosh Know If No One Tells 'em?
## 
### 
According to reports, never wits ;i Frosh
class election so productive of handbills, cam
paign literature, and other electioneering as
the one just concluded. This is a definite vio
lation of Stanford's democratic non - cam
paigning tradition.
Yet the blame cannot be put on the Frosh,
for evidently no one told them plainly of it.
Flection Chairman reported the violation to
Fx Committee after the violations had oc
curred; F\ Committee agreed Flection Chair
man should remind the Frosh neatly locking
the barn door after the horse was far afield.
However, a lesson to upperclassinen and
student authorities might be gained from this
omission. Future elections in which new stu
dents are involved, this year or hereafter,
should find officials clearly explaining the
policy to the newcomers.
No tradition, however useful, is likely to
survive unless new generations are given
models to imitate, instructed what to do.
