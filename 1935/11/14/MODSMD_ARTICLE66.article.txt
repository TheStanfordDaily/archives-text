Saving tradition right and left, Our Hasher enters
the fourth day of his campaign to save tradition, and to
keep this column filled.
Though the free-ride to Paly tradition has some
times languished, it is a well known fact that Stanford
men are fast on the pick-up. In proof I offer this little
story:
Several days ago I printed a little tale about a
certain sophomore in a certain house up the Row who
pulled six Roble rarebits out of a hat and escorted
them in state up to and including the certain house on
the Row, where dancing and dining was indulged in
to all hours.
Now in Los Angeles over the week-end this certain
quiet, studious sophomore received another call to duty.
Hearing of his prowess, two law school grads in the
same house summoned the soph, bade him go forth,
return to Vine and Sunset Streets in Los Angeles at
3 o'clock in the morning with three women. At 3
o'clock in the morning at Vine and Sunset Streets in
Los Angeles, the sophomore appeared, trailing behind
him four lovely ladies.
Getting back to tradition, Our Hasher views with
chagrin the shennanigans carried on in Encina because
of the frosh elections yesterday. Handbills, posters,
and political ward-heelitig is shocking the staid old
walls of the hall, unaccustomed to such disregard of
Stanford tradition before the past two years. How
over. one bunch of cut-throats unwittingly preserved
the old ways, when they went around and carefully
collected and destroyed all the handbills of a rival
political tong one hour after they were passed out.
A Phi Psi recently was in a great hurry to get to
the great Palo Alto marts of trade, so he hopped on his
speedy bike, coasted down the slopes .of San Juan
Hill, zoomed down past Encina, kept up his furious
pace down Palm Drive. But behind him he heard the
baying of the dog.- of the law, and the clickety-clack
of the mounted patrol. "Whoa," said the Dogged Pa
trolman. The Phi Psi whoaed, and the cop heeled
over and pinched him for speeding.
Quoting from the S.F. Society Page review of Aida:
Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur was seen straying into the
wrong box, and hurdling the partition between.
