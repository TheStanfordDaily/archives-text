# Logic Wins Another Round From Olympic Boycotters
## 
### 
Officials of the Southern Pacific A.A.I', yes
terday drafted a strongly worded resolution,
in effect requesting that Jeremiah T. Maho
ney, president of the national A.A.l'., resign
because of his stand against sending an Amer
ican team to the Olympic (lames in Berlin
next summer.
The resolution, which instructs district rep
resentatives to the national A.A.l'. convention
to oppose the introduction of any resolution
limiting or denying A.A.l 1 . assistance in the
Olympic preparations, clinches even further
the certainty of American representation at
Berlin.
In an official bulletin, the American Olym
pic Committee has made its own stand clear
with the statement that "except for waves of
propaganda, the situation has not changed in
the least since the American Olympic Com
mittee unanimously, in 1934, accepted the
German Olympic Committee's invitation to
compete at the Games."
Odds are increasing that amateur sport will
win its battle with Olympic boycotters who
fail to see that their boycott would be an af
front, not merely to Germany, but to the other
4<S nations which will compete, that the prece
dent of ignoring extraneous issues would be
broken and sport would become the "football"
of every cause, and that anti-Nazi protests in
the long run would lose effectiveness by a
boycott of this type.
