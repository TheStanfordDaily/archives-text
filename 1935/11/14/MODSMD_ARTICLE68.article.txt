K.O.T.C. AND THE CONSTITUTION

If a .student at the University of California for any
reason whatsoever refuses to take required military
training ... is there anyone to whom he can appeal
to keep from being thrown indignantly out of school?
. . . There is not . . . The Supreme Court says so.

Last year this question was put to test. A student
who was refused the right to attend Cal because he
balked at putting on puttees and marching around in
the sun, claimed that the rights guaranteed him in the
fourteenth amendment of the Constitution were being
infringed upon. That seemed like a reasonable assump
tion, but strange things happened when the case went
to the highest court of the land.

In the fourteenth amendment is that familiar clause:
"No stale shall make or enforce any law which shall
abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the
United States." One would naturally suppose that this
prevents a state university from refusing admittance to
anyone eligible to enter. But the court ruled otherwise
on the grounds that the fourteenth amendment applies
to U.S. citizens and not to state citizens, and that the
man appealing the case was merely a state citizen.

This situation one can chalk up as one of the idio
syncrasies of the Berkeley stronghold, but how is it
here on the Farm? This university won't toss you out
of school if you refuse to spend two years taking some
kind of exercise or in the F.O.T.C. corps. It will
simply refuse to let you graduate.
Say those in accord with the policy of college mili
tary training: "The reasonableness of the compulsory
military training rule is based on the duty of the
government to preserve itself. With military aggres
sion on a large scale now going on in certain parts of
the world, the necessity of preparation for defense is
hardly to be doubted." The fact that this preparation
consists of three hours a week of marching, riding, and
shooting of field caution for 60 weeks—a period equiv
alent to 26 seven-hour days dragged out over two
years—apparently does not enter into the question.

We wonder what that gentle first president of Stan
ford, David Starr Jordan, would think of all this. He,
the man who was thrown bodily off the Capitol grounds
for leading a protest parade against war on the very
day Congress sent this country into its greatest war.
