# "NOT OUR FAULT"

The Editor, Sir:
Dear I. M. Screaming—Your kick
is quite justified, but the responsi
bility is put on the wrong heads. The
Rally Committee did not put any stu
dent s on the ten-yard line as they

held seats in the front of the root
ing section until the half for late
students.
Did you and the handful of other
students get in the stadium or was
it the Coliseum police who chased
you away to the ten-yard line. Did
you know that the band, which was
allowed five rows in the original
plans, took it upon themselves to oc
cupy eight?
As far as throwing out all "bald
heads and strange faces," the Rally
Committee can only seat those who
have tickets sent to them by so
called loyal students.
