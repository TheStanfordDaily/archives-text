The Editor, Sir:
Read in the S.J. Mercury wherein
one Stanford Smart Guy got himself
pinched for raising too much racket
in a public place.
And then sour-graped himself by
calling the public-spirited copper
who pinched him, saying Palo Alto
employed stoolies.
It's just too bad, "Irate Student,"
that your old man can't apply a bed
slat where it would show the least
and do the most good.
You ought to be put to work for
15 hours a day at 12 cents a year.
You guys with four years of fun
iind frolic ought to be ashamed of
yourselves.
In most cases your dad or mother
is slaving, putting you through col
lege. You ought to be put through a
soup strainer.
And when you appear in a public
place ACT like a gentleman, if you're
not. Others about you paid dough
to HEAR the pictures, too.
If you don't like the show, appear
at the box office and you'll get your
money back.
