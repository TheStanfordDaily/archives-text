"SHE COULDN'T TAKE IT"
At the New Menlo Theater
BWith "She Couldn't Take j
It," small but wide-awake
Columbia again proves its '
ability to borrow stars from j
larger producers, discover their '
latent talents, and with them turn ,
out surprisingly entertaining films.
Long criticized for an alleged lack i
of acting ability, both George Raft j
and Joan Bennett are sympathet- ;
ically cast in roles which bring out I
their best. This fast-moving com- i
edy-drama displays Raft as an ex- |
gangster whom a dying tycoon
(Walter Connolly) makes trustee of ;
his fabulous estate. The trouble Raft '
meets from the family spend- !
thrifts, daughter Joan and wife
Billie Burke, supplies the film's ac- j
tion-filled situations. A speeding car j
sequence, to which Columbia has j
long been addicted, climaxes the j
picture rip-snortingly.
Part of the picture's charm lies
in the facts that Raft wears a mini
mum of high-waisted trousers, is >
not required to dance.
