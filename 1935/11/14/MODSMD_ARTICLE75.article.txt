other case of good talent be
ing wasted on a mediocre
story. Paul Muni is cast as a

give an honest portrait of a sensitive
doctor in a town of narrow-minded
hypocrites. Later, as the bullets fly
thick and fast in the "cops and rob
bers" melodrama, he becomes the
conventional brave hero.
Ann Dvorak looks pretty and
scared. Barton McLane Ls excellent
as the hearty leader of the mob.
