# DIANA'S DIARY
## 
### THE CO-ED SHOPPER 
Dear Diary: I'm in the throes of j
Big Game fever—and so is every- !
body else. The boys ask, "Who's
going to win it?" and the gals, ;
"What are you going to wear?" The !
last problem is solved at MARY j
ELIZABETH'S, 119 University,
where there is the grandest selection
ol formals and informals in crepes, !
lames, and satins—no two alike, '
either. I've just about decided on a i
bright green that's formal without. ;
the jacket and a dinner gown with it. i
Since there must be an evening hat, I
I'm delighted with her metallic tur
bans and tiny veiled bonnets of net. j
And about sandals—no girl could
go wrong at the WALK-OVER, 220 1
University. They have 'em in high
or low heels in crepe, gold, silver, ;
and those adorable rainbow moire ;
sandals that go with anything. I
Flowers are going to be worn—by j
day and by night. So if you want,
to be correct, the FLOWER SHOP, I
175 University, can set you right j
about corsages and the new hair or- \
naments of posies. At MARIAN f
SEIMAS', 534 Ramona, I found an !
item of intimate interest. It's an '
evening bra of satin and net, cut
for the lowest decollete and fastens i
with tabs to your garter belt. Big ,
Game coiffeurs are something to j

I worry over—but I got the low-down
i from LYDIA, 460 University. You
! should get your permanent several
; days before the party if it's to look
j perfect. She has the Zotos machine
! less for $10 and the oil permanents
| from $5 and up. Perfume is the fin
j ishing touch for a big evening, and
that's why I'm excited over the new
j Ballarde that Alexandra de Markoff
just introduced. The odors are Sum
| mer, Spring, Fall, and Charm—and
I it comes in the swankiest colored
l satin cases. The UNIVERSITY
' PHARMACY, 134 University, has
! it as inexpensive as $1.50. Everyone's
I been asking where to send guests
! and friends for meals when they
' come to town for the game. My best
: answer is JEROLD'S, 229 Hamilton,
I right next to the Cardinal Hotel.
| Sounds as if I've done nothing but
make Big Game plans, but I've also
j been going to class. However, send
i ing all my papers down to the ASSO
j CIATED STENOGRAPHERS, 443
| Bryant, for typing, does save time
! and trouble. My term papers are
i going there, too, and with the end of
I the quarter looming, it won't be long.
' Which reminds me—it's time to think
about Christmas cards. And that
1 means WIGHTMAN'S, 366 Univer
j sity, where there is a grand selec
i tion of all kinds and prices.
