Controls and flattens even heavy figures with no look
or feeling of corsetry—that's because it's made of the
firmly wovn, patented, two-way stretch Youthlastic.
Fashion's newest line demands a real corset —something
more than an "elastic shirt."
Wash Le Cant OFTEN for the best results. It's thin—
light—and the most comfortable corset you ever wore!
