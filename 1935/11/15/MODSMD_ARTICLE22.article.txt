# Life On Farm Tame Now to Old Timers
## 
### DAVE BOTSFORD 
Present traditions and activities on
the Farm are tame compared with
those of the old days, according to
Frank Taylor, Illustrated Review ed
itor, and Harold F. Elliott, electrical
engineering lecturer, both war-time
graduates.
The Big Game bonfire, for in
stance, was an event long looked
forward to and huge in its magni-.
tucle. Freshmen, organized into
great armies, spent weeks build
ing and guarding the fire.
To keep California or Santa Clara
ruffians (when Cal cut off 'diplo
matic relations," the Big Game was
with Santa Clara) from setting of!
the great rally fire ahead of time,
small fires were built all over the
campus, kept burning day and night.
A1 j roads were continually guarded
by the froth who, said Taylor, got
liltlc sleep for two weeks and did
practically no studying. Freshmen
women worked nearly as hard to
furnish hot coffee and food for the
workers.
Fresh life was no tame affair as
it is today. From the moment the
first-year men entered Encina the
battle with the sophomores was on.
"The idea," clunk ltd Taylor, "was

for one class to wipe the other out."
Hi.zing of frosh took various forms.
A favorite method was for the sophs
to blindfold the newcomers, march
th< ni across the fields—many times
on their hands and knees—to water
troughs located around the campus.
Hi re they would be "tubbed," vir
tually drowned. An unusually strong
freshman class, however, sometimes
got back at their enemies by "tub
-1 ing" them in huge old bathtubs,
then a prominent part of Encina.
Also "natural enemies" were the
juniors and seniors. The "plug
ugly." reminisces Elliot, was the
annual night fight at which the
seniors defended one of the Quad
arches the juniors attempting to
crush through. The juniors wore
crazy costumes and tall top hats
made heavy with white lead.
During the battle many a senior
head connected with a junior hat.
and felt none too good.
Many another virile tradition, now
defunct, made life hazardous but ex
citing for the Stanford Rough of
two decades ago. But automobiles
hud yet to become numerous enough
t< draw Farmsters to the City for
in. re sophisticated, less thrilling fun.
