# Philologist Will Talk on Radio
## 
### 
Pointing out some of the absurd
ities of our system of spelling, but
warning against a sudden sweeping
reform, Dr. Arthur G. Kennedy, pro
fessor of English philology, will
speak on "The Simplification of
English Spelling" on the Stanford
Radio Hour from station KGO at 8
o'clock Monday evening.
Until Caxton set up his printing
press in England, spelling changed
rom time to time to keep up with
he changes in pronunciation, but
after the development of printing,
pronunciation changed without any
corresponding change in spelling, Dr.
Kennedy explained in support of his
generalization that. English spelling
today is largely that of the medieval
period.
Dr. Kennedy is the author of "Cur
rent English," a book published last
summer to explain the usage of
words and expressions.
