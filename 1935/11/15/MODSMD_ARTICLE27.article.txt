charged the B.A.C. with inconsist
ency in its policy of selling rooters'

less than 5,000 seats remaining for

In order that those students who
wish to sec the Big Game may re
ceive fair treatment at the hands

in the handling of rooters' tickets
in the future: One, that the B.A.C.
should follow a consistent policy
in the time of closing the ticket
sale; two, that the B.A.C. should
hold ticket sales on the Quad in
order to be more accessible to the
students; three, that the ticket sale
should not take place on a week

recommend that these students he
allowed to purchase end zone
tickets for the price of the regular
