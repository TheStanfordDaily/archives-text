### 
MANILA, Nov. 15 (/P). â€” Self
government returned to the Philip
pine islands today after an absence
of nearly 400 years.
With shrieking whistles and burst
ing firecrackers the Filipino people
hailed the day that marked estab
lishment of their commonwealth
government and the beginning of a
10-year march to independence.
Hours before the scheduled in
auguration of Manuel Quezon as the
first Philippine president the streets
of Manila rang with merrymaking.
Quezon Guarded
But not all the gaiety and excite
ment could quite drown out the faint
rumble of extremist dissastifaction.
More than 2000 constabulary sol
diers detailed to preserve order kept
on the alert for trouble. Quezon
was heavily guarded because of
many assassination threats.
