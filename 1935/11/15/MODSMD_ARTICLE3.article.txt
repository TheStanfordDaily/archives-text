# Pope Pius Hopes To Delay Sanctions
## 
### 
ROME, Nov. 14 (A*). â€”Earnest ef
forts by Pope Pius to obtain post
ponement of sanctions in the inter
est of world peace became known
today -four days before both the
League of Nations and Benito Mus
solini are scheduled to raise their
economic drawbridges.
But, despite the Holy Father's
hope that 51 world powers will de
lay their stiff economic boycott, of
Italy because the Fascist state has
made war on Ethiopia, sanctions
generally were expected to become
effective next Monday.
