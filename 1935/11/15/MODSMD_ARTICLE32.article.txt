# Card Seconds Face Montana Tomorrow
## Bones Hamilton To Start with Reserves as Tiny Plans To Save Regulars for Big Game; Grizzlies Touted as Bone-crushers 
### WARREN BREED 
The second siring eleven that starts against Montana tomorrow being
by no means a motley or a green group, the No. 1 red, white, and brown
toboggan is looking forward to plenty of action —twiddling their collective
thumbs on the bench.
Of course no one as yet has seen fit to condemn Montana's Grizzlies ; <
a bunch of tarne, toddling cubs, but the fact remains that the No. 2 varsity
will take the field at 2 o'clock tomorrow with no lack ol experience anu
latent ability backing them up.

► All eleven were on the varsity
squad last year. Three of them—
Carl Schott, Alex Trompas, and
Bones Hamilton — were heroes of
the 1534 Big Game.
In the line will be Schott and
Trompas at ends; Niels Larson and
Pop Grant at tackles; Tom Calla
ghan, Larry Cooke, or Dave Cuneo
at guards; Alf Brandin at center.
Reisncr to Start
For backfield Montana will face
Johnny Campbell, quarter; Hamil-

ton and Johnny Reisner, halves; Ray
Todd, full.
The idea is that if this bunch of
stalwarts can tame the Grizzly in
mortal comliat, the varsity will be
spared the danger of facing the
foe, thereby rendering them fit as
eleven Stradivariuscs for the Bear
hunt eight days hence.
Montana, it seems, has earned the
cave-mannish reputation so far of
being a bunch of unmitigating bone
crushers, boys who like to get in
there and rough it up a la Strangler
Lewis.
And maestro Thornhill does not
want Grayson or Topping or the
others to spend the next week in a
hospital cot.
Hamilton last night looked good
as gold running through plays
with the shock troops. With Bones
in, the offensive threat is multi
plied, for he blocks like no one
else does, and is right behind
Grayson at packing the pelota.
Besides winning the ball game, a
sub-plot tomorrow will be to watch
the work of the men in the back
field. t
Campbell, Todd In
Reisner was one of the best in
high school, as a frosh, and at rugby,
but injuries and what-not have kept
j Jawn from starring on the varsity.
A beautiful runner, he may get away
! today.
Campbell, who passes the ball
just like he was pitching a base
ball, wiil have his chance at out
| smarting the brute-strength boys
tomorrow and flip some telling
passes.
The movies of the S.C. game here
yesterday showed that Ray Todd
| packs the threat of a first down
| every time he carries the ball. A
j former sprinter, he runs low and
: hard.
