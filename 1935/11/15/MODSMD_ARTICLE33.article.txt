# FRANK HAPPY

### 
Frank Alustiza was the
world's happiest man last night
as doctors finally gave him per
mission to see the Big Game
next Saturday.
The Basque quarterback, who
has been in the hospital for al
most four weeks with a serious
ly dangered eye, incurred in
the U.C.L.A. game, will watch
his team-mates — the men he
has played with for four years
—from a car parked 011 the
top rim of stadium.
