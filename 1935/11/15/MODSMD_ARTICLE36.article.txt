# Dr. Eliot Jones Addresses Club
## Transportation Professor Speaks on Railroads 
### 
Dr. Eliot Jones of the economics
department, who has written a num
ber of books dealing with transport
problems and public utilities, ad
dressed the Pacific Railway Club
yesterday in San Francisco on "The
Prospects for the Railroads."
Dr. Jones pointed out that the
present position of railroads is
precarious, and that as a whole
they were unable to earn their
charges in 1934 and will almost un
doubtedly fail to do so in 1935.
The speaker blamed both present,
economic conditions and the negli
gence and bad policies of the com
panies for the decrease in both
freight and passenger traffic by rail.
The increase in private automo
bile ownership, the depression,
competition of other transporta
tion agencies, and strict regulation
were cited as prime causes of the
present difficulties.
Dr. Jones mentioned the restora
tion of normal business conditions as
the greatest hope for the railroads,
and cited their present efforts to
modernize cars and service as a great
step forward.
