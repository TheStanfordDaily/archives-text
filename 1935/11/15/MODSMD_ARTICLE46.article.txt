The Editor, Sir:
In answer to the letter by ''Non
ticketed Driver" I wish to state—
I agree with Much-ticketed Driv
er that some kind of fine and speed
readjustment should be made in our
California Vehicle Act.
The fact that mere speeding neces
sarily decreases the marginal safety
factor of everyone concerned is not
justifiable. Usually a driver who is
traveling at GO miles per hour is far
more intent on his driving than is
cue driving at 40 miles per hour. . . .
I believe we should have a more
rigid operator's exam. . . .
