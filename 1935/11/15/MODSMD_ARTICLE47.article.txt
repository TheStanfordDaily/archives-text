# WELL, HOW ABOUT IT?

The Editor, Sir:
How about learning the school
hymn? Even the little (what Stan
fordites would call "one-horse")
school which I attended last year
had an audible school hymn. Ours
seems to consist of the printed page.
The band sounded wonderful over
the radio Saturday, but not until
the announcer mentioned it did we
know that the rooting section was
. apposed to be contributing to the
program. I was listening to the game
in the company of some U.C. friends
and they all laughed when we stood
up to sing . . .
