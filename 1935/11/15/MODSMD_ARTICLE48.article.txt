# "UNJUST EMBARRASSMENT"
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
I see no reason why John Fuller
and his supporters should be em
barrassed by the attention brought
to (he violation of the so-called tra
dition of "no campaigning" in elec
tions. The very Ex Committee that
agreed that such was violation of
tradition were violators themselves
of the same tradition, to the same
extent, in the spring election las'
year, as were student officers during
past years.
There is no doubt a need for defi
nite legislation to limit campaigning,
;ij 1 suggested at the Ex Committee
meeting Tuesday.
