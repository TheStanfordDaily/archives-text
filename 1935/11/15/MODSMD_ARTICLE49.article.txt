The Editor, Sir:
The fellow who was arrested in
the Stanford .Theater last Saturday i

for making a racket was absolutely
innocent. I ought to know, because
I Was the one making about nine
tenths of the noise.
I was sitting a couple of seats away
from him, and know for certain that
he caused no disturbance. Any one
of numerous students who were sit
ting near will say the same thing.
The fact is, we all laughed when
we saw the wrong man being nabbed.
Of course, we supposed he was just
going to get a talking to, or at the
most, kicked out and his money re
funded.
My sincere regrets to the guy who
"took it."
