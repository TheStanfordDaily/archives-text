All letters must "carry a signature, and are subject to deletion of unnecessary
details. The Editor has the right to withhold from publication any corre
spondence strictly malicious in nature.

those once mighty words. Surely,
those who benefit most from the
established government and Amer
ican institutions should be willing
to do the most for them. . . . At
Bt rkelcy, .students are receiving an
education from the state . . . they pay
no tuition. Shouldn't they be pre
pared to defend that state which is
so generous to them?

looking at the enemy bullets. . . .
But if the War Department thinks
training college students will help to
strengthen the country so that no
nation will attack us, then I'm pre
pared to do my share.
