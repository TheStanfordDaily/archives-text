# Bruins Seek Water Title In Tilt Here
## Uclan Water Polo Hopes Rest on Games With Stanford, Cal 
### 
Inspired, determined to win the
championship that now lies within
their grasp, a band of undefeated
Bruin water poloists will lirst tangle
with the Berkeley Bears this after-
I noon and then invade the Indian
I stronghold at Encina Pools tomor
| row morning at 11 o'clock.
A Uclan victory in either battle
j this week-end will give the mighty
Bruins the Pacific Coast Conference
' championship for the first time in
j league history. Until last Friday
j Stanford's tanksters had never been
| trimmed by U.C.L.A. For the past
j five consecutive years preceding that
l tilt the Cardinals had nosed out the
J southlanders 'by a single goal in
every game.
With last week's battle, how
ever, came the Bruins' chance to
retaliate. And retaliate they did.
although they found it necessary
to put into action every ounce of
energy a dogged Uclan defense
could muster. The Cardinals
clearly outplayed the Westwood
ites during the second period to
slash out two tallies, but the final
score nevertheless read 5-3 —it
was a triumph that the Bruins
had long awaited.
Tomorrow morning the same out
fit of victorious mermen returns to
the Farm, set upon collecting still
another win. Though the Uclans, by
virtue of a probable victory over
California, may enter the local tank
as Coast titlists, the Indians will
nevertheless have a sizzling recep
tion awaiting them. Coach Nort
Thornton has been putting his
charges through heavy offensive
drills during the past week with the
result that the Indian attack now
functions as effectively as ever.
Co-captains Wally Wiget and
Bill Woodard, both of whom are
top-notch guards, will be relied
upon to give the Bruins no little
trouble. And Bob Ilaslacher, bril
liant All-Conference goalie, will
probably taste plenty of action,
too. It was Haslacher who staved
off no less than 20 goal shots in
the U.C.L.A. tussle last week.
The dopesters who pick the Uclans
over the Indians are doubtlessly
thinking of the flashy performances
turned in this season by Mel Sellers,
All-Conference sprint ace, who ac
counted for 4 of the 5 goals scored
by the Bruins last Friday. Captain
Ed Knox is destined to be another
big fly in the Cardinals' ointment.
He, at center back, is still another
All-Conference tankster.
Should Coach Dowden's Golden
Bears be downed by the Uclans this
afternoon, the Indians will be fight
ing doubly hard to at least tie for
the league title that they've held for
the past 22 out of 23 years.
Tentative starting lineups are as
follows:
Stanford U.C.L.A.
Hoover sprint Sellers
Giffin r. forward Fiske
Clemo 1. forward Woolfolke
Sutherland c. back Knox
Woodard r. guard Adams
Wiget ]. guard Daubenspeck
Haslacher goalie Wood

Co-captains Wally Wiget and
Bill Woodard, both of whom are
top-notch guards, will be relied
upon to give the Bruins no little
trouble. And Bob Ilaslacher, bril
liant All-Conference goalie, will
probably taste plenty of action,
too. It was Haslacher who staved
off no less than 20 goal shots in
the U.C.L.A. tussle last week.
The dopesters who pick the Uclans
over the Indians are doubtlessly
thinking of the flashy performances
turned in this season by Mel Sellers,
All-Conference sprint ace, who ac
counted for 4 of the 5 goals scored
by the Bruins last Friday. Captain
Ed Knox is destined to be another
big fly in the Cardinals' ointment.
He, at center back, is still another
All-Conference tankster.
Should Coach Dowden's Golden
Bears be downed by the Uclans this
afternoon, the Indians will be fight
ing doubly hard to at least tie for
the league title that they've held for
the past 22 out of 23 years.
Tentative starting lineups are as
follows:
Stanford U.C.L.A.
Hoover sprint Sellers
Giffin r. forward Fiske
Clemo 1. forward Woolfolke
Sutherland c. back Knox
Woodard r. guard Adams
Wiget ]. guard Daubenspeck
Haslacher goalie Wood
Inspired, determined to win the
championship that now lies within
their grasp, a band of undefeated
Bruin water poloists will lirst tangle
with the Berkeley Bears this after-
I noon and then invade the Indian
I stronghold at Encina Pools tomor
| row morning at 11 o'clock.
A Uclan victory in either battle
j this week-end will give the mighty
Bruins the Pacific Coast Conference
' championship for the first time in
j league history. Until last Friday
j Stanford's tanksters had never been
| trimmed by U.C.L.A. For the past
j five consecutive years preceding that
l tilt the Cardinals had nosed out the
J southlanders 'by a single goal in
every game.
With last week's battle, how
ever, came the Bruins' chance to
retaliate. And retaliate they did.
although they found it necessary
to put into action every ounce of
energy a dogged Uclan defense
could muster. The Cardinals
clearly outplayed the Westwood
ites during the second period to
slash out two tallies, but the final
score nevertheless read 5-3 —it
was a triumph that the Bruins
had long awaited.
Tomorrow morning the same out
fit of victorious mermen returns to
the Farm, set upon collecting still
another win. Though the Uclans, by
virtue of a probable victory over
California, may enter the local tank
as Coast titlists, the Indians will
nevertheless have a sizzling recep
tion awaiting them. Coach Nort
Thornton has been putting his
charges through heavy offensive
drills during the past week with the
result that the Indian attack now
functions as effectively as ever.
