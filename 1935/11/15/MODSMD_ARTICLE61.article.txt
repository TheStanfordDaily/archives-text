# Law Grads Get Tough, Trounce Menlo Eleven
## 
### 
They had never played together
before. They had no plays, no press
write-ups, no condition — not even
uniforms could they boast.
But they called up Coach Ad
Dewey over at Menlo, borrowed
some uniforms (from Ad, too), went
over to the jaysee field, thought up
plays as they went along, and
trounced the Menlo Junior College
football team, 28-0.
Who? Why, a dozen hearties from
the law school, some of them former
grid stars, who took enough time out
from their Blackstone to get a little
workout at the expense of the beer
town boys. Menlo recently bowed to
the Card frosh, 40-0.
Late Release
The game was Monday, but news
of the victory leaked out only late
last night through humiliated Menlo
lips and happy, but study-saturated
law-step chatters.
The barristers were led by one
Eizo P. (Buck) Van Dellen, one-time
Big Red Machine left halfback and

long-striding safety man. Elzo's
chores consisted of scoring two
touchdowns and tossing passes (a
new one on Thornhill) for the other
pair. Jim Massey made good the
conversions.
Rod Bost, one-time Card casaba
star, snagged one forward and Vin
Cullinan the other, after a 40-yard
heave. Nice going, Elzo.

The attorneys, who are positively
not considering a Rose Bowl bid,
lined up with Stephen Wyckoff, for
mer Pomona luminary, and Aylett
Cotton, forme]' Indian rugger artist,
at ends; Ralph Mac Michael, one
time Card heavyweight, and Ed
Taaffe at tackles; Tom Moroney, of
Santa Clara, and Robert Boyd at
guards; John Gallagher, another ex-
Bronc, at center.
In the grid backfield were Van
Dellen at full, Bost and Jim Massey,
one-time Card catcher, at halves;
Frank Ingersoll, also a one-time rug
ger, at quarter. Van Cullinan was
utility man.
