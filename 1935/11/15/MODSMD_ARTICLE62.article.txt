# ANNOYING SMOKE

The Editor, Sir:
The comments condemning cig
arette smoke in last, week's issues
of The Stanford Daily could be

greatly multiplied by those who ap
pieciate pure air and sanitation.
Surely the administrators will take
; a hand in correcting the intolerable
I conditions.
Is the sense of respect so be
numbed in those who are addicted
that the gratification of their un
| natural craving is paramount to
wholesome tradition and the rights
of others? Cigarette fiends rushed
i to the foyer during intermission of
I the last concert in the Pavilion and
I puffed such an offensive barrage
it,to the auditorium that the air was
obnoxious the rest of the evening.
The visiting artist and the audience
had no recourse but to breathe the
odious smoke or leave the building.
