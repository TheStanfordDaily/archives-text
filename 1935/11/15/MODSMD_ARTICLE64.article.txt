# Cardinal, Bear Soccer Teams Vie Tomorrow
## Indians Short-Enders As Bullis Shifts Line-up 
### 
With the success of their entire
| season at stake, Stanford's varsity
I soccer team will tangle with Cali
| fcinia's on Edwards Field, Berkeley,
! at 10 o'clock tomorrow morning.
1 Coach Dick Bullis* eleven regards
| this game with the Blue and Gold,
j and the return contest a week later,
! as even more important than con
j ference standings.
The Card soccermen will be un
derdogs, since the Bears are in sec
ond p!ace, one notch above Stan
ford, which is tied uilli San Mateo
Junior College fur third. If they
can defeat California twice, how
ever, the Indians should finish
i second behind the champion U.S.F.
| team.
! In spite of the loss of Mike Gomez,
! star center forward who is on
| crutches with a sprained ankle, Stan
| fcrd's first string looked good in
! practice yesterday. Gomez will be
' out for at least a week, but may face
the Bears on the Farm Big Game
i day in the season wind-up.
Bullis shifted Karl Schaupp
from his wing position to center
forward as a result of Gomez' in
jury. Ed Nightingale is now at
j right wing, replacing Schaupp. In
; a scrimmage against the second
string, the regulars scored as nev
| cr before last night, and have a
real chance to defeat the Bears
j tomorrow.
Stanford's probable starting line
| up is as follows: right wing, Nighl
| ingale; right inside, Sawyer; center
i forward, Schaupp; left inside,
Knecht; left wing, Barker; half
i backs, Hatch, Hall, and Sloan; full
! backs, Vierling and McGormick;
! goalie, Helms.
