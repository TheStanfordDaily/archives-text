HOBBY WASN' T
IN I All.

Mil Kill,
They call it coloring the news.
This wot-k there'; been a fine exam
ple of that process in regards the
"Bobby Grayson vs. L.A. Police"
humor yarns.
It seems that on his way to visit
friends just I:, fore the U.S.C.
name Bobby was supposed to have
been tagged by a Los Angeles
copper. lie tried to talk the said
law officer out of the slip but
finally had to resort to using his
name— "I'm Bobby Grayson," he
explained, "and I'm in a hurry to
get to the ball game."
"If you're Grayson, I'm Joe Louis,"
w;..:; the reply. And, according to re
porters, Grayson was escorted to the
Los Angeles jail, where he spent
some time trying to prove his iden
tity and get a release.
When he finally did get to the
f.i'me, Tiny and the team were pretty
hot around their respective collars
over the possibility of Bob not show
ing up in time.
That's the story as half a dozen city
sports scribes tell it. And it made a
peachy-fine humor yarn. Except
that it was only about one-half true.
Now, Bobby himself may not
Know anything about it. but on the
other hand, he probably does. And
bis explanation goes thusly: The
cop stopped him, took his name,
let him go on. Elapsed time: 5
minutes. Wasn't in jail, wasn't late
to game.

BUT THE COFFIS
YARN WAS OKAY

They toll one about Jimmy CofTis
(he told it himself the first time but
didn't, think it would ever reach the
press), one that also occurred in that
Trojan game. This one is fact.
An S.C. man was injured. Jim
was seen to walk over and mas
sagc the Trojan's badly knotted
muscle. Afterwards they asked
him why the sudden burst of
sympathy. Came the reply, of
which Jim has since said, "I was
only joking"—"(lee, I didn't want
'em to take that guy out. He was
the easiest fellow to block on that
whole squad."
Then there's another about CofTis
and Woody Adams. It seems that
Ernie Nevers was roasting Jim, while
they were on the train coming home.
Jim was catching the devil for hav
ing played too close up at the safety
position.
Jim knew that Ernie was right
in his accusation and was trying to
think of some way to change the
subject when Woody came to the
rescue with a quip that did the
trick. Woody has a habit of help
ing Jim out of such bawlout ses
sions.
There was a baby blimp, trailing
a long "Hying signboard" behind, cir
cling over the field during most of
the game. So Woody pipes up with
words to the effect that "Aw, he was
wi.tchin' the blimp too much." And
the sweat session was over for Jim.

That's the story as half a dozen city
sports scribes tell it. And it made a
peachy-fine humor yarn. Except
that it was only about one-half true.
Now, Bobby himself may not
Know anything about it. but on the
other hand, he probably does. And
bis explanation goes thusly: The
cop stopped him, took his name,
let him go on. Elapsed time: 5
minutes. Wasn't in jail, wasn't late
to game.

BUT THE COFFIS
YARN WAS OKAY

They toll one about Jimmy CofTis
(he told it himself the first time but
didn't, think it would ever reach the
press), one that also occurred in that
Trojan game. This one is fact.
An S.C. man was injured. Jim
was seen to walk over and mas
sagc the Trojan's badly knotted
muscle. Afterwards they asked
him why the sudden burst of
sympathy. Came the reply, of
which Jim has since said, "I was
only joking"—"(lee, I didn't want
'em to take that guy out. He was
the easiest fellow to block on that
whole squad."
Then there's another about CofTis
and Woody Adams. It seems that
Ernie Nevers was roasting Jim, while
they were on the train coming home.
Jim was catching the devil for hav
ing played too close up at the safety
position.
Jim knew that Ernie was right
in his accusation and was trying to
think of some way to change the
subject when Woody came to the
rescue with a quip that did the
trick. Woody has a habit of help
ing Jim out of such bawlout ses
sions.
There was a baby blimp, trailing
a long "Hying signboard" behind, cir
cling over the field during most of
the game. So Woody pipes up with
words to the effect that "Aw, he was
wi.tchin' the blimp too much." And
the sweat session was over for Jim.

Mil Kill,
They call it coloring the news.
This wot-k there'; been a fine exam
ple of that process in regards the
"Bobby Grayson vs. L.A. Police"
humor yarns.
It seems that on his way to visit
friends just I:, fore the U.S.C.
name Bobby was supposed to have
been tagged by a Los Angeles
copper. lie tried to talk the said
law officer out of the slip but
finally had to resort to using his
name— "I'm Bobby Grayson," he
explained, "and I'm in a hurry to
get to the ball game."
"If you're Grayson, I'm Joe Louis,"
w;..:; the reply. And, according to re
porters, Grayson was escorted to the
Los Angeles jail, where he spent
some time trying to prove his iden
tity and get a release.
When he finally did get to the
f.i'me, Tiny and the team were pretty
hot around their respective collars
over the possibility of Bob not show
ing up in time.
That's the story as half a dozen city
