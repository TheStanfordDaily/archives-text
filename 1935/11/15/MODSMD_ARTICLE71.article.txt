# Gael-Bronc Tilt Headlines Grid
## U.S.C., Cougars Meet In Conference Game 
### 
As Stanford and California loaf
through the week - end with so- j
called "breathers," the two big Pa- \
cific Coast tilts will be the St. ;
Mary's-Santa Ciara battle (and no !
less) and the Troy-Cougar tilt in
the Coliseum.
Sunday's embroglio at Kezar looks I
like a honey. Both the Broncs and '
the Gaels have strong scoring elev- j
ens, and have only missed beating j
the Conference leaders repeatedly '
by close scores.
Game Is Toss-up
Odds are even at this point. Clip- I
per Smith is hoping to score first, !
and Slip Madigan thinks his Mo
ragans will win
Clipper is banking on Hay Ka- :
liski, fast and resilient Oakland :
speeder. Slip is counting on passes j
and field goals. In Herm Meister he j
has a second Moscrip at. garnering j
three points. Les Groux and Herb
Schreiber are the passers, flinging â– 
them to Eddie Erdelatz.
Wagner Jorgensen, center, is the
Gael line mainstay; Norm Finney,
Dick Bassi, and Captain Dutton arc
the Bronc line stars.
Trojans Improved
S.C.'s Trojans will be fighting to
avoid the natural let-down that .
usually follows a game in which

they outdo themselves, like the In
dian garpe last week. But they are
obviously much stronger now than
they were six weeks ago.
Other Coast games are: U.S.F.-
Denver, Oregon - Portland, 0.5.C.-
Idaho, U.C.L. A.-Hawaii, and Loyola -
Michigan State.
