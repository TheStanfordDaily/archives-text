## Cards Meet U.C. Subs At Berkeley Tomorrow 
### 
Tapeiing off v/ith a light signal
drill today, the Stanford Grays' foot
ball team anticipates its own "big
game" tomorrow v/ith the California
Ri mbiers as decided underdogs. The
Indian and Bear reserve squads wijl
meet at 11:15 o'clock in the Memo
vial Stadium at Berkeley, playing
the preliminary to the Bear varsity's
tussle with College of the Pacific.
Undefeated and untied this sea
sen. the Ramblers have helped the
Blue and Gold varsity in practice
tliis week by imitating Pacific's
passing attack. Their version of
the Tigers' aerial thrusts will be
pitted against the passes of Earl
' Hoes, Grays' halfback, in tomor
row's game.
I An indication of the Ramblers'
strength is given by the fact that Bill
Basham and Dick Sugars, two of
their ends, have replaced the injured
Jack Brittingham and Jud Calla
ghan at the right flank position on
Stub Allison's varsity. Jack and his
brother Bob Brittingham are among
many Bear stars promoted from the
Ramblers.
Stanford, however, has a former
varsity player in Hoos, who calls
signals and passes for the Grays,
and docs much of the ball packing.
The chances of Cuddeback's team
depend largely on the relative suc
cess of the two lines in stopping
him and in checking the running
and passing of Doug Mcltae and
Eddie Hopkins, stars of the Ram
bler backfield.
Jay Holdridge, quarterback, does
the Grays' kicking. Leo Madlem, of
the 1934 frosh, and Harlan Carter are
the other backs. Tomorrow's prob
able starting iine-up includes Clark
and Chouteau, ends: Ferko and Mc-
Kinney, tackles; Pinnell and Brig
ham, guards; Heath, center; Hol
dridge, quarter; Hoos and Madlem,
halves; and Carter, full.
The Indian jumping snake is ca
pable of leaping from one tree to
another to the distance of 10 feet.
This snake has a green body covered
with brilliant bars and spots of red,
yellow, and orange.
