## Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily Member of the Associated Press Despite Indifference, Some Traditions Cannot Die While There Is a Stanford 
### 
Tin*re is probable not a wet eye on the
Stanford rumpus ;is Tradition Week ends.
II hits heeoine painfully evident that few give
a hool for the- harangues in the Daily to stiek
by the old traditions.
This does not of necessity point to any de
cadence of the whole school, per se, but it
does point to change. Those traditions that
are about to die for lack of functionality will
most likely die, despite any impassioned pleas
to save them.
The Law Steps tradition, dating back to
the days of the plug-uglies and having some
nebulous connection therewith, will probably
die and no one be the wiser. The time is likely
to come, since hazing has died, when the "no
cords-for-frosh" rule will by the boards,
but this will not cause the sun to reverse in
its orbit.
Women will this week sit in a corner of the
men's rooting section. In recent years, they
have s;it variously at the top, id one side, on
both sides, and in front of the men's section.
Supposing, idler this year, women are per

i milted to sit regularly in the front corner of
: the section. This would not be a significant
and saveworthy tradition; it would merely be
; a custom.
What then are the underlying traditions of
Stanford? Those tendencies and attitudes
which will always be a part of Stanford as
long as it exists as a distinctive Stanford -
what arc they?
To a close observer, there appear three such
super-traditions. They are: Every Stanford
man is a gentleman; every Stanford man is
' democratic in thought and manner; every
Stanford man is friendly.
Manifesting these traditions are tile Honor
(lode, the Hello Spirit, No Smoking on Quad,
Hide-Humming, and the lack of various forms
of ostentation.
When any considerable portion of these
manifestations die, it will indicate an atrophy
of the underlying traits. When those traits
pass, faith with the founders will be broken,
the inspiration of Dr. .Jordan will be forgot
j ten, and Stanford will no longer be Stanford
| but just a hollow shell.
