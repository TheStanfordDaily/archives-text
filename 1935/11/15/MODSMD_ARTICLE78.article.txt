# The 						Big Game Comes Nextâ€”After Montana

### 
While the big city and all those "in the
know" are looking al Stanford's football team
as a long shot to defeat California a week
hence, the Farm anxiously thinks in terms of
Rig Game and a possible redemption of her
slightly waning gridiron reputation.
This pre Rig Game contemplation is a
yearly occurrence al Stanford; this season's
orgy, however, seems to be starting a bit
early in view of the fact that Montana fur
nishes a very real hurdle in tomorrow's
"breather."
Montana sends :i rugged team the same
that played Washington Stale the week be
fore the Cougars lost to Washington, '21 to 0;
the same that engaged the Huskies seven days
prior to their 14 to I) defeat by California.
This year's Grizzly eleven is powerful, as
Montana teams go, and upsets are still in
vogue.
Next week, the Farm .becomes Rig Game
conscious; between now and then, Coach Tiny
Thornhill and all the lads play an altogether
dilVerent team, which would deem its season
complete if it were to topple "mighty Stan
ford." To consider Montana a brealher to
morrow might be comparable with stopping
lo rest in the middle of a swim across Golden
Gate.
