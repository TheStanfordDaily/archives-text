# Our Hasher Sez

The War is on!
On foot and horseback, auto and oughtn't, piano and
assorted, the crowd of terrified women are taking up
their cudgels against Our Hasher. They apparently
believe in Emerson's old saw that if a man makes a
bettor scandal column than his neighbor, yea even
though his mind is in the deepest woods, the world
will make a beaten path to his door and tell him to
keep his mousetrap shut.
Being of a delicate and sensitive nature—kind of a
hothouse plant (say the Pi Phi house, for instance) —
Our Hasher's soul is being warped and twisted by the
steady stream of abuse he is receiving. But ain't it fun,
though, Mamie?
First gun in the campaign was fired when a fresh
man woman turned in a declination slip to the Elec
tion Board's ballot box saying, "She declined to be
the goat in Our Hash -r Sez. Signed: A terrific woman."
Now that is untrue. I never tried to get anybody's goat.
Shucks, folks, 1 was only kidding.
Now comes a mysterious message through the mails
directed deceitfully to "Velly Nice Hash Boy
findum, Stanford Daily
Stanford, Calif."
Inside is the little ditty—
De;ir Hash:
1 Sash
Our Hash
Is Trash.
The letter is charmingly signed: "Terrifish." My
only reply to such a scurrilous charge is that my
garbled garbage is prepared by a chef skilled in *he
cuisine of appealing to discriminating ta;4e. If you
don't like it, my fran\ you may take my trash
and lump it—or dump it.
So tasty and chewy, ummm, ummm.
As a hit of rebuttal to another scurrilous attack,
which was directed at the unsullied reputation of
Roble hashers, » bit of original verse has been pre
pared by the noble hasher under attack.
Tall, dark, ;>nd curly
Offers ihis suggestion:
He's sorry he impairs
The Roble gal's digestion.
But on the other h;md,
His job's concerned with hashin'.
And crowd d dining rooms
Are not the place for pashin".
May the Roble dears titter over their morning snail,
and try to answer that one.
