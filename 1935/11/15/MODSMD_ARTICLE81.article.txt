SO ROLLO DOESN'T NEED A CAR
Granting that the forty horses of the modern auto
mobile are more expensive to maintain than the single
hay-burner of 30 years ago, granting that collegians,
spurring their metallic prancers with careless heels,
sometimes become maniacs, little Rollos in universities
across the nation, Stanford included, fight for cars
and get them.
The triumph over papa's better judgment is usually
a bitter one, for parents a* a class do not credit their
good sense but their emotional and nervous weakness
when they finally give in and scream, "For God's sake
buy yourself a car and shut up."
For it is inherent in the parental mind that. Rollo
really doesn't need a car, and that if he gets one he's
getting what the economics department might call a
marginal utility, very nice, but essentially unnecessary
and expensive.
<■ * A- $ ,
Both papas who have gone to Stanford, and papas
who know of this university only by family acquain
tance, test Rollo's argument for motorized transporta
tion by taking a ride around the campus in the family
chariot. Sundays at the beginning of fall quarter
Stanford's lanes are full of smooth eights floating
smoothly from the Fiji house to the Quad and back to
Branner with no effort at all.
Sitting at their ease, well-fed, well-rested parents
got the impression that the distance from Toyon to
the psych department is just a step or two, even at
9 minutes past 8, th.it a bicycle would be more than
sufficient, that girls would be so thrilled to go out with
Rollo that they'd walk with him up to the Palace.
* * *
The truths, so painfully evident to unmotorized
Stanfordites," that campus distances are enormous,
measured by the heel-and-toe method, that gals like
to sit comfortably while traveling, that Southern Pa
cific has an almost Oriental philosophy about getting
people where they're going, escapes the analytical
parent completely. He is only more firmly convinced,
after his test ride, that Rollo is even more spoiled than
he had thought in asking for a car.
Papas often credit their children's inordinate motor
mania to a desire to keep up with the "Joneses." It
never occurs to them that Rollo is competing with the
automobiled Joneses for his share of campus fun or
campys dates (officially a rhetorical distinction). For
papa's youthful romances were necessarily limited to
peripatetics, hammocks, or perhaps a ride with a seli
steering horse in a rented hack.

It is difficult for him to realize that romance, like
everything else, has speeded-up, and that if Rollo is
to get his social breaks he has to be able to go faster
than his legs or a steam train will carry him.
Frankly, Ihe scholar who dates only on occasion,
who doesn't participate in campus activities, doesn't
need a car. But most papas would hate to think that
their terrific investment in Rollo's education was lim
ited to what w;is in text-books. They want him to
give the co-eds a whirl, go to the games, mess around
with extra-curricular activities.
But that kind desire and the reassuring statements
from powers on high that a car isn't necessary aren't
enough to guarantee Rollo an all-fU'ound university
experience. He needs power, power under the hood,
driving four wheels ai.d a tonneau.
