# Reviewer's Bawl-Out
## NEW RECORDS 
### 
With the current rage for emigrat
ing to America which .seems to have
hit the English jazz maestros (wit
ness Ray Noble and Jack Hylton),
few top-notch British bands still re
cord on English soil. The best of
those remaining (until they start
importing Jack Payne's records),
Ambrose, of the Mayfair, has this
week recorded two jazz classics in
his best continental style.
On the B side of the disc you'll find
a slow, piquant recording of that
great blues-chant, "Body and Soul."
It's simple and un-pretentious, like
most of the British jazz orchestra
tions, but makes good listening.
The other side is a pressing of
Friml's colorful "Chansonette."
You'll find these on Decca disc, 584.
P.S.: For sample of Ambrose's very
best style take a look at his record
ing of "She Wore a Little Jacket of
Blue." It's one of the fall's ten best
records. Also don't forget the sum
mer bounce-piano hit, "Hors
cl'ocuvres."
Also available this week are four
tunes featuring the hot vocal-cords
of that towering black trumpeted,
Louis (Salchelmouth) Armstrong.
The Harlemesque bowlings of this
negro baritone haven't been heard
on the whirling discs for some time.
He's back now with the same old
cokey vocal work and the same
blaring, bluish, glissando cornet. He
gives "Got a Brand New Suit," "I'm
in the Mnod for Love," "You Arc My
"Lucky Star," and "La Cucaracha" a
thorough going over. Strictly items
for the "hot" fans, but right up that
particular alley. They're on Decca

discs 578 and 579. ■ j
The other two Decca records of
the week are from the baton of Vic
tor Young and are the model of me
diocrity. It's good dancing rhythm,
done in a workmanlike style, but
lacking any real vitality. However,
if you're looking for the sort, of mu
sic that you can dance to and ignore, j

take a look at Decca discs 581 and
582. The songs featured are "The
Oregon Trail," "Boots and Saddle,"
"It Never Dawned on Me" and
"When the Leaves Bid the Trees
Good-bye." —Squires
