# Fifty Nations Put Sanctions Into Operation
## Refuse To Send Italy War Necessities; Fascist Exports Shunned Mussolini Digging In Oil, Coal, Iron Embargo Awaits U.S. Support 
### 
LONDON, Nov. 17 (/P). — The
league of Nations threw the strength
of half a hundred nations behind
an economic boycott of Italy at mid
night tonight but Benito Mussolini,
digging in defiantly for his siege,
warned tiie world: "An eye for an
eye."
The League powers participating
in the boycott, proclaimed at Geneva
in an effort to force an early end to
Italy's war on Ethiopia, have
pledged themselves:
1. To buy nothing whatsoever from
Italy.
2. To send to Italy none of certain
"key products" essential to the man
ufacture of arms and implements of
war.
Test League's Strength
The economic wall that Great
Biitain, France, and the other league
powers thus have built, around Italy
constitutes the major part of the
sanctions program applied under the
league covenant.
Fifty-two states applied a finan
cial boycott beginning October 31,
52 placed an arms embargo on Italy
and lifted it from Ethiopia; 47 ac
cepted the mutual aid project by
which countries hard hit by apply
ing the boycott will be helped by
those less affected.
Other Bans Delayed
An additional embargo on export
to Italy of oil, coal, and iron will
not be imposed until the league is
convinced of the full support of
non-league exporters—especially the
United States and Germany.
Actual imposition of the economic
boycott at midnight was theoretical
—in some respects temporarily —
since legal aspects were slightly de
layed in some countries, including
France and Spain.
