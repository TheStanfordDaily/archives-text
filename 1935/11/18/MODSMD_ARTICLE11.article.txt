# Man Lost From Vessel in Gale
## Fifty-Mile Wind Slashes Atlantic Seaboard 
### 
NEW YORK, Nov. 17 (/P). — A
howling northeast gale slashed the
Atlantic seaboard today, crippling
at least one freighter, beaching a
number of small fishing craft and
hurling thunderous waves against
the coast.
Caught in the storm off Ocean
City, l\ld., the 3000-ton freighter,
Hartwelson, railed for help. One
man was washed overboard. The
ship is of :»000 tons and carries a
crew of 25. Two rescue vessels
stood by. The Hartwelson ex
hausted its storm supply of oil in
an effort to calm the seas.
Coast guard cutters were pro
ceeding to the aid of two unidenti
fied schooners, reported in trouble,
one off Cape Henry, Va., and an
other near the entrance to Nar
ragansett Bay, on the New England
ooast.
Ripping across Long Island, the
50-mile an hour wind howled over
trees, smashed windows and
wrenched signboards from their
moorings.
Fire island, a literary colony off
the south shore of Long Island, was
battered by 20-foot waves. Coast
guardsmen there said it was the
worst storm in 20 years.
