# Tobacco Firms Top Daily Space Buyers

### DAVE BOTSFORD 
From a score or more advert using
agencies throughout the United
States to the business offices of The
Daily each week come fat, tan en
velopes full of juicy, income-pro
ducing advertising contracts. Na
tional Advertising Manager Dorothy
Vernier files the contracts, measures
the "ad." sends the "copy" to the
composing room, and the next
morning readers are buying "Old
Manila" chewing tobacco or "Cover-
All petticoats.
Of Daily advertisers cigarette
manufacturers are the most potent,
pay most into the publication's
(nflcrs. More than half of The
I)ail\'s national advertising is from
live tobacco companies.
Many companies place advertising
only at certain times of the year.
Los Angeles hotels appear just befor â€¢
Stanford games in the southland.
Swimming suit manufacturers are
distinctly absent when icy blasts

How over the Santa Cruz mountains.
National advertising is heaviest in
early fall, at Christmas time, and
then again about the time Indians
stalk away home for the summer.
Variety among advertisers is
notable. Your clothing should be
"/ippered." you might phone the
folks tonight, your money is safe
in two or three banks, and certain
steamship companies will gladly
transport you to Europe for the
summer. "Baled hay" and Pep
will build you up. "next time try
the train,' 'and "Monsieur, the
Magazine for Men" contains the
stuff that puts a guy over with
the women.
All of which add.s up to the fact
that people don't buy advertising
just to fill up space. It works on
yr ur subconscious mind, whether
you like it or not. and you'll probably
end up buying Daily-advertised
