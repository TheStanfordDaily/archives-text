## Quad Ticket Sale 'Won't Work,' Says Masters 
### 
Three suggestions offered by the
Cardinals to tho B.A.C. Thursday for
regulating the .sale of rooters' tickets
range from "possible" to plain "im
practical," according to Alfred B.
Masters, graduate manager and
Board of Athletic Control member.
Must Be B.A.C.
Adherence to announced "closing
time" on rooters' ticket sales may
become B.A.C. policy next football
season, Masters said, in response to
the Cardinals' written request for a
"consistent policy in the time of clos
ing the ticket sale."
Ticket sales on the Quad, to serve
those unable to conveniently drop
in to B.A.C. headquarters, the Cardi
nals' second suggestion, will simply
not work out, however. "We can't
have thousands of dollars worth of
tickets just floating around," Mas
t( r,s pointed out. "Furthermore,
most all of the men find it con
venient to visit the BA.C. Only the
women might have legitimate com
plaint on our centralized sale policy."
Enough Time Given
Protest that ticket sales were con
fined largely to week-ends, when
many students are away from the
campus, and a request that the sale
period be placed entirely during
school days, met with luke-warm
reception. "Most of our sales start
Thursday, giving students two full
days to make their purchases. I be
lieve this is sufficient time," Masters
said.
