GOSLAR, Germany, Nov. 17 l/I'l.
â€”More than 500,000 peasants have
jf.ined Ihe "new aristocracy" the
Nazis are establishing on Germany's
farms. They form a strong bulwark
for National Socialist principles, for
these families must be racially ap
proved and the land can only be
parsed from father to eldest son
except in very unusual cases.
