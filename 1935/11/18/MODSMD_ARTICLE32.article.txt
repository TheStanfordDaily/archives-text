# Hamilton Jumps On As 'Red Toboggan' Heads for Big Game
## Leg Holds Up as Bones Shows Old Drive For 45 Minutes Play Montana Licked, 32-0 Todd and Williams Prove Reserves' Strength

Bones Hamilton climbed on the
Red Toboggan last Saturday, gave it
a mighty shove, and rode with it
over the last hump—Montana—and
into the straightaway before the big
climb—California next week-end.
And as it l»cgins to gather speed
this week with Bones back on

of reserve worries.
It was with special joy that they

bad leg carry the weight for 45
minutes of strenuous play for the
first time in weeks. For it seems
that the Hamilton of season* past
is back.
But it wasn't with smiles that
they saw Bones come off the field
with a broken nose, the result of a
kick, accidental or otherwise, from
the shoe of Montana's Popovitch.
But Doctor Fritz Roth, team physi
cian, last night echoed his words
just after the game that Bones would
be able to play against the Bears.
Roth went on to explain that the
break, though not serious, was
painful and there was a possibility
that Hamilton would wear a guard
Saturday.
Other than that one break, Stan
ford emerged with no serious in

shoulder. Doc Luckett a strained
leg muscle, Neils Larsen, a leg
