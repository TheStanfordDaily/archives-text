# Hamilton Jumps On As 'Red Toboggan' Heads for Big Game
## Leg Holds Up as Bones Shows Old Drive For 45 Minutes Play Montana Licked, 32-0 Todd and Williams Prove Reserves' Strength 
### Gordy Frost 
Bones Hamilton climbed on the
Red Toboggan last Saturday, gave it
a mighty shove, and rode with it
over the last hump—Montana—and
into the straightaway before the big
climb—California next week-end.
And as it l»cgins to gather speed
this week with Bones back on
board, those first eleven men who
ride it know that the second eleven
are mighty capable football p'ay
crs; that they played more than
ordinary ball when they rode over
Montana 32-0 to give the Grizzlies
their worst beating of the year.
Those first eleven know that
there is a Ray Todd, and a Fred
Williams, and Johnny Campbell,
Alex Trompas, Carl Schott, among
others, who played a quality of
football that isn't far from first-string
brand. And they, along with all
Stanford boosters, are glad to know
that in that display last Saturday
may lie the answer to Stanford's lack
of reserve worries.
It was with special joy that they
watclied Bones block, intercept,
and receive passes in the old Ham
ilton style; that they observed his
bad leg carry the weight for 45
minutes of strenuous play for the
first time in weeks. For it seems
that the Hamilton of season* past
is back.
But it wasn't with smiles that
they saw Bones come off the field
with a broken nose, the result of a
kick, accidental or otherwise, from
the shoe of Montana's Popovitch.
But Doctor Fritz Roth, team physi
cian, last night echoed his words
just after the game that Bones would
be able to play against the Bears.
Roth went on to explain that the
break, though not serious, was
painful and there was a possibility
that Hamilton would wear a guard
Saturday.
Other than that one break, Stan
ford emerged with no serious in
juries. Pop Grant has a bruised
shoulder. Doc Luckett a strained
leg muscle, Neils Larsen, a leg
Charlie horse. All will be okay j
next week-end.
So it was that Stanford profited i
much by the Montana affair. Bones I
went on the proving ground, came !
out with okays on every division of
play but running. There he will well
use more practice to put on the finish
he possessed in games last season.
But he'll provide the blocking, the
typical hard "Hamilton blocking" J
that Bobby Grayson can so ably use.
And then there were Kay Todd
and Fred Williams, who accounted
lor 107 and 122 yards from scrim
mage, respectively. Those two,
behind the blocking of Johnny
Reisner, Hamilton, and Joe Vigna, I
looked like second Graysons.
Schott and Trompas at the end
posts were outstanding, Campbell's
passing was super, Larsen, Grant,
and Alf Brandin in the line were !
fine. No longer must Stanford worry
about reserves.
And what was also gratifying—
Stanford passed, and made them
good. Shortly after the opening
whistle Todd flipped a beauty from
near the 50-yard stripe to Bones, j
whe took it over his shoulder on the
dead run, lengthened his slight lead
on Blastic to show he still has the !
speed, and crossed the goal. Tromp
missed the kick.
And a little later after Larsen
had blocked Popovitch's quick
kick, Trompas recovered, and Wil
liams and Luckett had made gains i
through the line, another pass, this
time Williams to Trompas, was
good for 17 yards, putting the ball
on the Two more plays and
the score. Tromp converted.
Then in the second half they 1
marched again, this time from the
Stanford 41. A Montana clipping
penalty helped, Campbell and Todd
ran, it went quickly. Trompas |
kicked, making it 20-0.
An intercepted pass by Alf
Brandin started the next one,
which went equally as fast. Tromp
neatly caught a hard pass, Todd
executed a perfect fake pass, a
couple more plays and it was over. !
Tromp missed.
And it was another pass late in
the fourth, Campbell to Schott, who !
was stopped on the three, plus two |
more line drives that scored the |
last tally as Trompas missed the j
conversion. Montana never threat
ened.
