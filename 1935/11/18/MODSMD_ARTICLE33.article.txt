# Kennedy Talks On Air Tonight

### 
Dr. Arthur G. Kennedy, professor
of English philology, will speak on
"The Simplification of English
i Spelling" on the Stanford Radio Hour
j from station KGO at 8 o'clock to
| night, pointing out the absurdities of
I our present system of spelling.
The generalization that English
: .spelling today is largely that of the
I medieval period is supported by the
fact that after the invention of the
j printing press by William Caxton in
England in 1474, pronunciation
changed without any corresponding
change in spelling, as there had been
! previously.
In the medieval period, the doub
ling of the vowel often indicated that
i it was to have a long sound, of
which "door" is a survival. The
I doubling of the consonant after a
! vowel also indicates that it is to be
I short, as in "supper" as distinguished
from "super," but there are ex
! ceptions.
