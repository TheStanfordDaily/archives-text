C 0.P., remaining undefeated. So I
did Princeton, Dartmouth, Minne- j
seta, Texas Christian, N.Y.U., and
Southern Methodistâ€”the seven sole j
remaining nation's unbeaten.
Three more new Bears gained most
of the yards against A. A. Stagg's
Cops. They were Jack Howard, '
George Cornell, and Mushy Pollock,
the sprinter.
In the best game of the week-end
Howard Jones, the old fox, and Davie 1
Davis won S.C.'s first major vie- !
tory of the season by scoring three !
touchdowns in a dozen minutes to ,
break W.S.C.'s heart in round num- |
bers, 20-0.
Previously undefeated teams |
which lost Saturday are: Syracuse 0,
Colgate 27; Marquette 6, Temple 26;
North Carolina 0, Duke 25. The three
vanquished had Rose Bowl hopes. '
Temple, with Pop Warner, still has, |
as reports go.
Many parents in Germany are
against the big family idea because

mean an excuse for war to kill off
their heirs.
