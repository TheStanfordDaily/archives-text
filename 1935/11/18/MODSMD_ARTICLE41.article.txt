# Committee Reports On State Planning

### 
' WASHINGTON, Nov. 17 (AP).—
Permanent planning; agencies for
national, state, and local govern
ments were advocated by Presi
dent Roosevelt today in making
public a report by tbe National
Resources Committee on state
planning developments.
"Rapid organization and progress
of 46 state planning boards, accom
plishments < J f which are outlined in
tfv report of the National Resources
Committee," the president said,
"show the people of our country un
cu r«tand and want long-range plan
ning and foresight in public affairs.
Lasting Planning
"To give lasting substance and di
rection to planning wise use of our
human and natural resources, we
need permanent advisory planning
boards for towns, cities, counties,
states, and the Union."
Reports by the national resources
committee, headed by Secretary
Ickes and named by Roosevelt to
plan use and development of na
tional resources, were the original
basis for the $4,000,000,000 work re
lief program. But many of its rec
ommendations were laid aside, be
cause of Harry L. Hopkins' insist
ence on small projects designed to fit
ihe supply of relief labor in individ
ual communities.
Big Expenditure
Today, however, the committee ad
vocated establishment of a perma
nent public works administration to
co-ordinate federal and state works
programs it estimated would involve
expenditure of $26,000,000,000 be
tween 1935 and 1944.
1. Permanent status, with "ade
quate financial support," for state
planning boards with federal per
sonnel to help during "develop
ment period."
2. Unremitting efforts in the di
rection of closer co-Operation be
tween state and federal govern
ments in the many practical chan
nels through which they may now
be effected without injury to the
pride or prestige of either.
3. Closer consideration by state
planning agencies of resource devel
opment.
