# Grays Upset Unbeaten California Ramblers, 12-6
## Holdridge Is Key Man of Card Victory Nick Carter, Leo Madlem Score on Line Plunge, Reverse Play 
### Warren Breed 
Much to the surprise and embar
rassment of the "California Rolls
Along" Club, and its colleagues, the
"Undefeated Bear:;' Club, the Stan
ford Grays beat the California Ram
blers at Berkeley Saturday, 12-6.
Jimmy Hole's Ramblers, con
querors of several of the better
.Tajsee and small-college teams,
and direct furnishers of varsity
replacements, were long-odds fa
vorites to win over the Grays, of
whom nobody had heard before.
Friday.
But Murray Cudcleback's Grays,
nothing daunted, treated their more
famous guests to a rough time on the
Memorial Stadium sod, and caused
the first California football defeat of
the year.
Doug Mcßae, senior transfer from
Sacramento J.C., spark-plugged the
Bears to an early score, passing and
running across the Red goal in the
first period.
But back came Cuddeback's
goofs. The whole line recovered a
Mcllae fumble on the Bear 30.
•Toy Holdridge, last year's frosh
guard and captain, now playing at
quarter, Hipped a pass to Jack
Clark, who was tripped on the 2.
fullback "Nick" Carter plunged it
over.
Again in the second quarter the
little red machine counted. A long
march took them to the Cal G. where
Halfback Leo Madlem took the ball
around end on a reverse to make the
12.
Holdridge at quarter showed
enough light for a whole back
field, and his blocking and tackling
gave promise of his playing quite
a hit next year—maybe at quar
ter. maybe at guard.
The Grays lined up with Clark and
Chouteau at ends; Ferko and Mc-
Kinney at tackles; Pinnell and Brig
ham, guards; and Heath, center;
Holdridge, quarter; Hoos and Mad
lent, halves; Carter, full.
