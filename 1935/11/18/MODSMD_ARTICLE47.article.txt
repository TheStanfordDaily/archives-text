ONE UNBEATEN
BEAR TEAM WHIPPED
Last week California was slyly
patting herself on the back—said she
had "three undefeated Bear football
teams, frosh, Ramblers, and varsity."
Today Stanford may poke back
at the Berkeley folks, remind them
that only two of their outfits re
main undefeated now, and that
there may be only one left by this
time next week.
It was Stanford's down-trodden,
unpublicized little gang of Grays that
went to Berkeley last Saturday to
play their one and only game of the
season. Apd it was that same little
team that upset California's experi
enced Ramblers 12-6 to wipe out one
of the trio of unbeaten Cal grid
teams.
Yes, Stanford Grays, it's with pride
that Stanford points to you. You
who, without rooters, without a band,
without your due publicity, go to
Berkeley and dump their proud
Ramblers.
For that California team has de
feated some of the best in its class
this year. And that, theoretically,
makes you winners over those teams,
too.
The Ramblers beat Fresno State
13-7 and Cal Aggies 47-0 and the
U.S. Marines 14-13. And two of
those are mighty good ball clubs.
Fresno heat College of the Pacific
20-7 and the Marines are famous
for having one of the tougher ball
teams.
So it was no pipe to trip up the
Ramblers, and Grays, you're to be
complimented. Your record for the
season stands—Stanford Grays, un
tied. undefeated.
There are probably some who
still ask "Who the devil are the
Grays?" Well, my friends, the
Grays are Stanford's fourth, fifth,
and sixth string varsity football
men. This year they were never
officially cut from the varsity but
work along with the first string- '
trs under coach and scout Murray
Cuddeback.
When Tiny needs men to run op
position plays against the first string,
the Grays do it. When Tiny needs
a team to batter against the Stanford
offense, the Grays do it. When
someone wants to write a story about
football players they do it, but not
about the Grays. So it's a losing
game these subs must play.
They have only one game each
year, that with the Cal Ramblers.
Thus their year of play is not
counted as a year of competition
and they spend the season im
proving their football ability for
anticipated varsity activity.
Joe Vigna, Johnny Campbell, and
Fred Williams are three ex-Grays
who've realized their hopes for var
sity play. And there are several on
this year's squad who will do the

[ same next season, several who have
( deliberately chosen to play on the
i sub team with hopes for the future
I rather than use varsity competition
j while still not at best.
TINY WON'T
I SHOW PESSIMISM
In the dressing room following
Saturday's Montana game Tiriy was
being questioned on his attitude
' toward the Big Game.
"Do you pick Stanford to win?"
was the first query to put him on
the spot. To that he answered
sanely, too sanely for a good news
paper yarn: "We've got a good
chance, but I don't say that we
will.'', That's how he has, and
will continue, to stand.
But then they tried another in an
j effort to get him to say something
; new, "Do you 'fear Cal'?"
| There he exploded. "Hell no! We'll
; leave that stuff to Allison."
