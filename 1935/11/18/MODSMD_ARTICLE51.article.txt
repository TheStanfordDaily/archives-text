# Bruin Tankmen Nose Out Cards
## One Goal Scored in Last Period Decides Contest 
### 
Slashing through the entire Indian '
defense in the closing seconds of j
the tightest water polo battle ever
witnessed in Encina Pools, Mel
Sellers, flashy Bruin sharpshooter,
tallied to give U.C.LA. a 1-0 deci- I
sion over Stanford and the 1935 title
Salurday morning.
Sellers Scores
Each determined to x - out the other,
both of the squads fought tooth and
nail during the tussle. It was only
late in the second period that the i
Ucians began to exhibit a slight edge !
over Coach Nort Thornton's Cardi- j
in Is. Led by Sellers, the Westwood
:tes opened a barrage of goal shots
that, had it not been for the bril
liant work of Indian Goalie Bob
Haslacher, might, have piled up a ;
more enviable margin for them.
The winning tally came in the |
last 40 seconds, when the terrific j
grind had long since begun to tell on j
both septets. Both of the tank squads !
had succeeded in holding each other I
to nothing but wild shots that came ,
few and comparatively far between. I
The tilt seemed destined to end in 1
a scoreless tie when Sellers' goal did !
the trick in a split second for the â– 
southland mermen.
Thornton Pleased
The mighty Ucians entered the j
Farm tank as Pacific Coast Confer- j
tnce champions. They had gained 1
the title by nosing out the Golden j
Bears, 3-2, only ihe day before. The
Caidinals, had they edged out the ;
Bruins, would have boosted their
rating to a tie for the crown that j
they've won for the past 22 consecu- j
live years.
Coach Thornton was anything but j
displeased with his charges' .showing. I
