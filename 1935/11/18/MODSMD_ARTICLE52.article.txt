### 
With 1300 students not included in the Big
Came rooting section of 2500, either from lack
of desire or inability to purchase tickets, pro
tests against the closing of sales have been
coming thick and fast all week-end.
Complaints seem to lie on two grounds: the
sale was on days when many students were
in the South for the S.C. game and, in the past,
the B.A.C. has been so lax in adhering to its
announced days of sale that many students
suspected that these days too would be ex
tended.
As the B.A.C. well knows, and the Daily
pointed out editorially two weeks ago, it
would be far belter if rooters' ticket sales were
strictly limited to certain days, not permitted
to run over two or three extra. . This would
lead students to buy promptly, allow the
B.A.C. to dispose elsewhere of the good seats
not wanted by students.
In the past, the authorities have often be
come soft - hearted, given the students "a
break" by extending sales. Evidently starting
with the recent Big Came rooters' ticket sale,
these extensions are to be no more. Yet stu
dents feel chagrined because the past favors
given them by the B.A.C. have become, in their
eyes, privileges.
Policy of sales in years to come should be
(dear: three or four convenient, announced
days which will be rigidly adhered to; an
nouncement in the Daily several days in ad
vance; attempt to keep sale days from con-

Hiding with important away - from - home '
games. Quad sales, unfortunately, will not !
he feasible; moving the money and tiekets j
from the centralized B.A.C. appears to involve j
too many dillicLi 1 ties.
Still left holding the sack, however, are !
those students who want to see the Big (lame, J
hut have no rooters' tickets. What is the !
B.A.C. going to do for them? In view of the I
twin I nets that the B.A.C. has led them in the :
past to look on sale dates as not final and j
that the selected days this time were ineon- '
venient to many, even unknown to quite a few I
before they went to Los Angeles, some con- '
cession does not seem too much to expect.
Many students left Thursday for the South; I
not a few even left Wednesday. Although J
both days' Dailies carried announcements of '
the sale, they were not overwhelmingly con- j
spicuous, and students can scarcely be ex- j
pec ted to be looking for such announcements j
so long before the Big Came.
Hooters' tickets are indubitably gone. So j
are all other good seats for the game. All that !
remain are behind-the-goal tickets at .*4.40 j
per. To ask bona fide $1 10-a-quarter-payers
to lose all their ticket privileges in view of the
extenuating circumstances seems a little

With 1300 students not included in the Big
Came rooting section of 2500, either from lack
of desire or inability to purchase tickets, pro
tests against the closing of sales have been
coming thick and fast all week-end.
Complaints seem to lie on two grounds: the
sale was on days when many students were
in the South for the S.C. game and, in the past,
the B.A.C. has been so lax in adhering to its
announced days of sale that many students
suspected that these days too would be ex
tended.
As the B.A.C. well knows, and the Daily
pointed out editorially two weeks ago, it
would be far belter if rooters' ticket sales were
strictly limited to certain days, not permitted
to run over two or three extra. . This would
lead students to buy promptly, allow the
B.A.C. to dispose elsewhere of the good seats
not wanted by students.
In the past, the authorities have often be
come soft - hearted, given the students "a
break" by extending sales. Evidently starting
with the recent Big Came rooters' ticket sale,
these extensions are to be no more. Yet stu
dents feel chagrined because the past favors
given them by the B.A.C. have become, in their
eyes, privileges.
Policy of sales in years to come should be
(dear: three or four convenient, announced
days which will be rigidly adhered to; an
nouncement in the Daily several days in ad
vance; attempt to keep sale days from con-

Hiding with important away - from - home '
