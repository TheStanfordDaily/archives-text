# Renewed Farm Grid Hopes Echoed As Biggest of Modern Big Games Nears
## 
### 
Stanford and California, far ahead of the
field, have come over the last hurdle and are
surging toward the finish line in the crucial
race of the Hose Howl Invitational.
As the two headed into the stretch, the
Bears maintained their slight lead, but the
Indians were gaining rapidly after tripping
over the third barrier and barely skimming
each of the remaining obstacles.
That, at a glance, is the situation as Big
(lame Week commences, this week precedes
the most significant of all Big (lames in mod
ern Stanford-California history. It finds both
teams in the position they annually held when
this traditional rivalry began four and a half
decades ago they are Western United States'
two leading football squads.
And the Bears and Indians will finish their
race for the Pasadena trophy in such close
order that a judges' decision may be required
to pick the winner. The set-up is this: If
California wins or lies, she will represent the
West on January 1; if Stanford wins by a
fairly lop-sided score, the bid will be hers; if
Stanford wins a close game, the vote of Con
ference officials might elect either of the
teams.
The Bose Bowl, however, pales into a rcla
tivclv minor matter as the students at both

Berkeley and the Farm "go rah-rah" and di
rect their week's thinking in terms of "Poor
Cal," "Hate Stanford," "Who's (lot the Axe?"
and allied phrases.
Once, earlier in the season, the Farm be
came thoroughly loothall - conscious when
Washington threatened to irreparably wreck
what could have been Stanford's biggest year
on the gridiron. Now, as California issues an
ultimatum, similar to that of the Huskies
though it goes even deeper in effectiveness,
Stanford's student body rallies with another
sincere show ol support one which will be
j echoed before 90.000 paying guests next Sat
urdav.
