Recently called to my attention is the report of a
Stanford sorority's Hallowe'en party. This house, which
is situated way up thar, has to wait until all the
women have sampled the teas down below and doesn't
get a good chance to ply the women with tea and
cookies and get down to the real business ,of national
.standing. Anyway, to get back to the report in the
S.F. Examiner society sectionâ€”it said, "The room was
appropriately filled with pumpkins and witches."
While going over some of the past issues of The
Daily in my souvenir chest, and weeping copiously over
the glories of yesteryear, I recognized some of the gags,
and learned with remorse that I have been plagiarizing
myself.
Saturday morning the big bus was waiting to trans
port. the frosh soccer team to its game in the city, the
men were ready, the equipment all packed, when
somebody discovered that one of the members was
not present.
Coach Bullis immediately commenced an investiga
tion and uncovered some interesting facts. The missing
player had favored one of the local cinema parlors.
According to all available evidence the picture was
foul. It stunk. The missing player had a protest to
make. He lodged it. He put it in writing and wired it
for sound. The local militia pinned the button on him.
It cost Coach Bullis exactly $5 to get his missing
player out where he could breathe clean fresh air.
Not since the late Mr. Long's battle in a Long
Island country club has there been such an interest
ing story of a conflict behind the scenes as the one
that happened at the Rnble Formal Friday night.
Now it is an American tradition that the sanctity
of the home is inviolate, yet my very good friends of
Roble Hall flagrantly flaunted this old American prin
ciple during the dance. While laughing throngs danced
and pirouetted in the gaily dedecked dining room,
there was a grim struggle going on behind the scenes
for the men's dressing room.
Now it seems that during times of business normalcy
the dressing room in question is used by the women,
hut during dances this parlor is hastily converted into
a place for the gentleman guests. The means of hastily
converting it, being the placing of a sign over the
door.
A near-sighted and careless Robleite started off the
festivities when she took no notice of the sign and
proceeded to take the room by storm.
Later on during the evening round two commenced.
Several men walked into the room to find three women
in possession. "Get out." they said. The gentlemen got.
Tabulated results gave the first two rounds to the
Robleites. The tide turned later, however, and the
men finally regained mastery of the situation by posting
naids and singing loudly.
