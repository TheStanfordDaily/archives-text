## THE 						GARDENER-PHILOSOPHER 
### 
"Have you been doing any thinking lately?" . . .
he called out from the middle of the rose bed . . .
and we knew he wasn't speaking any puerile frippery
. . . for Copey always talks like that . . . Copey . . .
the raker of leaves up the Row . . . the sagacious
vendor of bet we en-classes wisdom.

Have you not seen him—horn glasses across weath
ered face, stubby pipe close-clamped in mouth? He
might well be the one who originated the Stanford
"Hello" tradition. He is old enough, and he has a
greeting for you a dozen times a day if you see him
that often. And if you pause, no subject can be men
tioned, but he has some ready comment, even though
it be upon the doctrine of Immanuel Kant.

When he asks if you have been doing any thinking,
Copey doesn't expect a quip or a guffaw for an answer.
He is serious. If you answer yes, he will likely inquire,
"What about," and if you say no, he will berate you,
but not harshly. Copey has traveled the several con
tinents, encountered Chinese pirates, mined gold, and
lived a life that spells adventure to those who hear
of it, and scores of frustrations to Copey himself.

This gardener-philosopher is a subject for the psy
chologists. Educated in England before the turn of the
century, he has not been without advantages and op
portunities. But today he ts a mower of lawns ant\
strangely, he seems happy. Urtending routine, a slim
purse, and a future that is not certain have not in
stilled dissastisfaction or synicism into his character.
Days are long for him, and the winter winds give him
the ear-ache, but still the wirey little gardener is per
petually cheerful and ever ready to quote Shakespeare,
talk of current events, or comment on the weather.
As a yeoman of fortune, Copey (we have never heard
his last name) has spent his years—years in which
fortune has stretched out its hands and left him with
little but a profound knowledge of many things, and a
galling belief that a man's life is as prearranged as the
new year's calendar.

Have you been doing any thinking? Just the sight
of Copey. if you know him, is spark enough lor any
thought process. It is a strange man who turns the loam
in our rose bed. —John McClelland
