# MORE ROOTERS' TICKETS
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
There are going to be a lot of
disappointed students next Saturday
when the Big Game comes off, just
because they were late in getting i
their rooters' tickets. When the sale j
closed ... at least 1000 persons were !
left "holding the bag" unless some- j
thing happens very soon.
True, the B.A.C. can make more
money selling these tickets to the i
public at $4.40 than it could if it sold |
the tickets to rooters, but is this fair? j
We were late, to be sine, and per- j
haps the BA.C. feels that we don't
deserve a ticket, but late or not, each i
student by paying his $115 is right- ■
fully entitled to purchase a ticket to '
the game . . . Griped
