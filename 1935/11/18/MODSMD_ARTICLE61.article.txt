# ANOTHER ROOTER LEFT OUT
## 
### 
The B.A.C. sold about 2500 tickets j
between the dates of November 6 |
and 9. It seems very strange to me i
that the B.A.C. should put only this 1
number on sale when there are j
nearly 4000 students in Stanford . . .
It seems only fair that a person |
with a student body card should be I
allowed to purchase a ticket in the i
rooters' section and be allowed to
root for his alma mater. . . .
Ticketless
