# TOO LATE, TOO
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
I wish to acquaint you with my
most deplorable state of affairs. First
of all, I am such an ardent rooter
of the Stanford football team that I
left for Los Angeles on Thursday
morning so that I would not be late
for the kick-off.
Now, my dear editor, imagine my
complete embarrassment, astonish
ment, and mortification when, upon
resuming to the Farm. I discovered
that rooters' tickets for the Big Game
were not to be had! What price loy

pity!
Consider, furthermore, this: I have
not missed a Big Game for seven
years, and I have been constantly
dreaming of sitting on the 50-yard
line (for a change), rooting for the
Cardinals. However, now that I am
a frosh, look what happens? What
price loyalty!
A Dejected Frosh
