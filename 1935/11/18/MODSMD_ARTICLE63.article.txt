The Editor, Sir:
I read with regret and misgivings
The Daily's story concerning wom
en's participation in card stunts this
yi ar.
Those poor card stunts! What's
going to happen to them in the hands
of creatures who have one eye on
the nearest sub on the bench and the
other on the nearest good-looking
male in the rooting section?
What's more, we'll probably have
several cases of hysteria among the
meddling young things when they
find themselves under the gaze of
thai throng! Why, oh why, can't they
sit there and watch their male su
periors without nosing in and spoil
ing the fun as well as the card
stunts? . . .
