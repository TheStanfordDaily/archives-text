# HIS NIGHT OUT
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
How is it that the police chief— I
public spirit number one — should j
suddenly feel that the Roughs wore j
destroying the peace when, in real- !
ity, it was he who was being both- I
< red. It certainly is a strange system I
when a man causes the arrest of I
those who indirectly pay his wages, j
simply because they were making
some noise in a movie when he went \
there on his "night off."
Plentysore I
