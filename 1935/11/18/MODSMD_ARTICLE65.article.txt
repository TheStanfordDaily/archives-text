# CHANCE FOR SOMEONE
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
I have followed with interest the
recent discussions in the editorial
column of Stanford traditions. It
would be entirely worth-while to
make such discussions more specific !
by a study of the traditions of this !

campus, their origin, rise, and wane.
There has been on my desk for sev
eral weeks a request from a pro- ;
fcssor of Ohio State University, who
is coiWucting a nation-wide survey
of student traditions. Some 50 major |
universities of the country have so
far agreed to co-operate in this |
study. . . .
I am sure that with the co-opera- j
tion of student body leaders and the
elder professors of the campus that
an interesting and valuable study
might be made. This would not alone
bo a contribution to the national
study, would provide a valuable
outline for our own tradition for fur- ;
ther consideration by the student
body, but might also fulfil the re
quirements for a term paper or a '
master's thesis in any one of several I
departments or schools.
I would be glad to co-operate with
the proper student in the making of |
this significant study.
