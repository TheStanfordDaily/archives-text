"O'SHAUGHNESSY'S IJOY"
At the Stanford Theater
B Wallace Beery's always tell
ing characterizations save this
rather unnecessarily pathetic
story of a lion-tamer's fight to
regain the affection of his young son,
whose mind has been poisoned
against him by a she-devil sister-in
law.
The often unconvincing Jackie
Cooper is unusually unconvincing as
the boy-cadet who is finally won into
admiration of his father's painful
uphill fight.
Light Spots art few, with Spanky
MacFarland's small bit standing as
a bright spot. If you consider suf
fering to be entertainment and don't
mind a transparent plot, you might
like it. But it's no "Champ."
"MUSIC IS MAGIC"
Also at the Stanford
This 60-minute "filler" show is a
'"C" except for the work of two un
heralded stooges—Mitchell and Du
rant. Their special breed of uncon
sciousness and kicking each other
about comes in often enough to keep
the audience from falling asleep.
Their two-man, chest-beating Tar
zan act is a wow.
Music is almost non-existent, de
spite the title. Bebe Daniels is fair
in an unsympathetic role of a Holly
wood star on the downslide; Alice
Faye is still blonde, still almost emo
tionless as a youngster fighting for
stardom. The less said about the
leading man the happier he should
be. —Kline
