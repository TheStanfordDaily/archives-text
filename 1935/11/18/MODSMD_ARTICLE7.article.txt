POCATELLO, Ida., Nov. 17 l/Pl.â€”
Two blistering attacks were leveled
here today against those allegedly
lesponsible for action barring use
of University of Idaho, southern
branch, facilities to the Student
League for Industrial Democracy
speakers in the future.
Donald P. Donahue, executive
committeeman for the league and
Socialist candidate for Congress
from the second Idaho district last
year, was particularly bitter in his
denunciation of John W. Foreman,
Idaho American Legion commander.
