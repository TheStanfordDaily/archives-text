# B.A.C. To Consider Ticket Policy Today
## Big Game Rooting Section Closed, but End Zone Price May Be Cut Officials State Stand Three Points Are Stressed In Student Protests 
### 
While moans of campusites un
able to secure student tickets to the
Big Game crescendoed to a new high,
the Board of Athletic Control will
meet at 10 o'clock this morning to
find a mutually satisfactory solution
to the "no tickee, no gamee" prob
lem.
But regardless of the volume or
consistency of protest, students
who have not made their purchases
will not he able to sit in the root
ing section, B.A.C. officials de
clared.
Tickets for the section are printed
in duplicate, one set for student sale,
one set for public-sale. Tickets not
bought by students have been de
stroyed and their duplicates put on
public sale.
Few Tickets Left
No mercy may be expected, it was
indicated, save the privilege of pur
chasing a limited number of end
zone tickets, publicly priced at $4.40
or $.'l3O. for $1.90 or $1.80, including
tax. Excepting these inferior seats,
the stadium is sold out as far as
the B.A.C. is concerned.
Meanwhile, general student pro
test against the assertedly unfair
IS.A.C. seat-selling policies boiled
itself down to three specific points:
(1) That students who attended
the S.C. game were unable to take
advantage of their ticket-buying op
portunities, extended on Wednesday,
Thursday, and Friday preceding the
Los Angeles match.
(2) That the Big Game is essen
tially a University affair, although it
has taken on the appearance of a
big-time performance, and that stu
dents should have more flexible tick
et rights.
(3) That Daily publicity preceding
the three days of sale was inade
quate to gain general student atten
tion.
'Have Been Generous'
"We have been most generous
with students," was the comment of
a BA.C. official last night. "The
three-day sale period we believe
was entirely sufficient. It was an
nounced in advance several times.
"We printed enough tickets for
every member of the student body,
and could have taken care of any
one who cared to buy during the
announced three-day sale period.
As for the S.C. game interfering
with purchases, there are many
signed up on the protest whom we
Know did not go to Los Angeles.
"Now, of course, the vast number
of good seats not bought by students
have been redistributed to selling
agencies and are gone beyond our
power of recall."
