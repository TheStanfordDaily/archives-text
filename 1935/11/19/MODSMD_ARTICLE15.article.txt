A total of $7,196.91 will be given

month's work on the National Youth
Administration jobs, announced
Lee L. Yancey, chief accountant of
the University, yesterday.
Checks which arrived over the
week-end are being distributed in
the lobby of the Administration
Building this week, and Yancey
urges all students to claim their
checks as early as possible, for all
checks uncalled for by Friday must
bp returned to the government.
To the undergraduate students will
go $6,168.12; first year graduate
students will get $307.21, and second
year graduates, $721.58. About 12
per cent of the student body is get
ting this federal aid.
These cheeks cover payment for
the fiscal month which ended Octo
ber 19, and each fiscal month for
NYA jobs will end on the 19th of
each month until next June.
All NYA release eal'ds for the third

fiscal month must be claimed either
today or tomorrow at (ho Registrar's
Office, announced Mrs. Irene Cov
crley, student employment director.
Time cards for the second fiscal
month, which ends today, must be
turned in by tomorrow.
Undergraduate students who work
on NYA jobs through Mrs. Cover
ley's office have failed to check
closely on their 30 hours of allotted
time, and Mrs. Coverley warns that
henceforth, students who fail to .com
plete their full 30 hours without
notification of inability to work their
quota will be automatically dropped
from the active list.
A long waiting list of students
anxious to work on NYA jobs will
readily fill any jobs left open by
students who fail to co-operate. In
ability to fill the allotted 30 hours
of work must be accompanied by
pood excuses, and release cards must
be claimed on the appointed days, or
else the waiting list will encroach on
the active list, Mrs. Coverley added.
