# Sandoe Star in Prize Student Play Reading
## 
### Phil Bernheim 
"George the Woman," Hall Mar- |
tin's play which won the recent !
Masquers' student play contest and
was read by them last night, is an j
unexpectedly fine job of play- j
wrighting.
Not that it is perfect, for it will I
need much revision, but it contains |
the elements of a fine piece of work. |
It has some remarkably fine lines, j
and some carelessly loose ones. It j
has some good characterizations, ;
and some erratic ones.
The play is the story of George
Sand and Frederic Chopin and their
attachment for each other. It is also |

the story of Solange, Sand's daugh
ter, and how she finally blasted the
relationship between her mother
and the composer.
James Sandoe was most excellent
in the role of Chopin, the physical
weakling and musical genius. Jean
Albertson was almost as fine as the
woman who wrote under a mascu
line name. Sandoe, though usually
playing comedy characterizations,
gave a sincere and feeling rendition
of Chopin.
Rosemary Benet's direction was
somewhat ragged, but the two leads
managed to draw the performance
together in the high spots.
