TOKYO, Nov. 18 (/P).â€” Japanese
dispatches said tonight an independ
ent nation of North China would be
created this week under the protec
tion of the Japanese Army.
This large new nation, the re
ports asserted, would sever all
economic and financial relations
with the Chinese National Gov
ernment at Nanking and seek to
promote cordial relations among
North China, Japan, and Manchou
kuo.
A spokesman for the Foreign Of
fice admitted the possibility of Japa
nese military intervention should the
Nanking Government send troops to
suppress the North China autonomy
movement.
The dispatches were from Peiping
and Tientsin. Their unanimity of
dttail indicated they sprang from a
common and well-informed source.
