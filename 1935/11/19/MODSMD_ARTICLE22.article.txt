# Toyon, Enema Hold Smokers For Game Fire
## Upperclassmen Asked To Help Build Sructure 
### 
Last night in Encina and Toyon
Halls smokers were held as pep
rallies for the bonfire to be set off
Thursday night. The meetings open
ed when Web Jones, assistant yell
leader, explained the purpose of the
fire and introduced Bob Hoover,
bonfire chairman.
Hoover first appealed to the uu
perclassmen to help build the struc
ture, previously done only by frosh.
He closed by asking for co-opera
tion and describing the plans for the
fire.
Bob Jones, co-chairman, told of
the refreshments that would be
served to the workers by "the best
20 frosh women we could find," and
advised that a close lookout be kept
for invading Cal men.
Jim Ransohoff, committeeman,
warned against lawsuits that might
be brought against the University
for such things as "tearing down
Farmer Jones' barn." Wally Brooke
followed with a comparison of our
bonfire with that of U.S.C.-U.C.L.A.,
which, he stated, "sometimes ends
up in a dog-fight."
Bob Elfving, Toyon president, an
nounced that after the game there
would be an open house dance in
Toyon for all Stanfordites, their
friends and relatives.
The bonfire committee expressed
appreciation for trucks loaned by
Palo Alto Lumber, Merner Lumber,
University Army Unit, Corporation
| Yard, Pennsylvania Sanitary Corpo
ration, Shaw Motor Company, and
finally the Horabin Feed and Fuel
I Company which is donating 400 gal
lons of oil and a spray truck.
