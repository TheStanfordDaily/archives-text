# 'Bones' Shifted Back to Right Halfback Post
## Tiny Hopes To Work with Injury-Free Line-up Before End of Week; Offense Polished, Team Works on Passes in Practice 
### 
For two years grid programs had always announced "Bones Hamiltonâ€”
right halfback." Then early this season Tiny Thornhill shifted Bones to
left half, but unfortunately Hamilton only lasted three games at that post.
Now he's back at his old job and what's more, that's where he'll probably
be in the Big Game.
Bones was very much in evidence at last night's practice session, even
though the better part of his face was hidden by a huge nose-guard.

nis two very uiacK eyes and basnea
nose may still repose behind that
mask when he trots onto the stadium
turf for next Saturday's conflict.
And if they do, it won't be any new
experience to Bones, for an injured
jaw sent him through the entire 1933
pigskin season adorned with a mask
very similar to the one he sported
last night.
Vigna Probably on Bench
With Hamilton definitely back in
the line-up at right half, tough Joe
Vigna will probably see most of his
Big Game action from the bench.
But Thornhill can count on Vigna to
bolster Bones. His record this season
proves his prowess as a back, and he
can always be depended upon to do
his share in any ball game. Jimmy
Coffis and Bill Paulman are tenta
tively slated to hold down the other
two berths in the backfield, while it's
pretty definite that Bobby Grayson
will start at full.
Absent from last night's routine
drill were Pop Grant, with a
bruised shoulder; Tex Luckett,
who has a pulled leg muscle,
which looks much like Hamilton's
recent injury; and Niels Larsen,
whose leg charley-horse kept him
on the sidelines. However, all of
these men arc expected to return
for today's workout, and thus,
for the first time this year, Tiny
has hopes of putting an injury -
free line-up through its paces be
fore the week is over.
Last night's session included the
polishing up of most of the Big Red
Machine's offensive tactics, together
with a good smattering of pass de
fense work. After the Montana tilt
last Saturday Tiny mentioned the
fact that he intended to work his
, warriors fairly hard until Thursday
j and then take it easy before the big
! test.
Thornhill and the gridsters fear
California not a bit, while word
j comes from Berkeley that Stub
Allison, faced with a heavy first
j string sick list, is already well on
his way worrying and Stanford
fearing. That the Big Game itself
will be an air-tight battle is little
doubted; general consensus rates
it a toss-up if there ever was one.
So Tiny intends to take no chances.
! Tonight the squad that promises to
be cripple-free turns out for an
! other strenuous session on the prac-
I tice turf.
