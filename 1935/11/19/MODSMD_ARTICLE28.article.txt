# Encina Rebels At Movie Edict
## Sponsors Issue Warning To Uprising Frosh 
### 
Encina Hall last night became an
assembly of theater picketers when
the frosh were stirred to an upris
ing due to restrictions placed on
theater-goers concerning cat calls
and other disturbances during per
foi mances.
The demand made by the theater
managers combined with several
incidents where students were
put in jail started the ball of dis
content rolling last week, and a
movie "razz" parade was staged
as student-filled cars circled the
theaters; their cry was: "Down
with the movies."
Last night the mob spirit reached
its peak when the Encina session
took place, at which all Cardinal
"Reds" were invited to bring toma
toes, ripe fruits, and other common
razzing missiles.
An Encina sponsor canvassed the
hall admonishing that quiet be
maintained, since the police had
stated: "There are just a few hot
heads up there in the hall, and if
they start something, they're lia
ble to get hurt."
