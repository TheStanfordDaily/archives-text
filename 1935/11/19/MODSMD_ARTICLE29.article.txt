CHARLOTTEVILLE, Va„ Nov. IS
j </Pj.—Electric signals detected for
1 the first time coming from the sup-
I posed "executive" center of the gray
i matter in the brain were described
j today to the National Academy of
j Sciences here.
The executive center is part of
1 the cortex or covering of the brain,
j a blanket of gray matter considered
I as the one development of evolu
| tion most responsible for man's supe
| riority and for the high status of all
j the mammals.
Detecting these signals and trac
ing them to their source is a new
experimental me thod of investigating
! the mysteries of the brain. The
1 work was reported to the academy
| by J. G. Dusser de Barenne find
W. S. McCullough of Yale University.
The experiments were conducted
on monkeys, whose cortexes are sim
ilar to man's but about a half milli
| meter less in thickness.
