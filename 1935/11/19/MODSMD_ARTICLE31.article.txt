Ras Siyoum, elusive Ethiopian
northern war lord, popped up today
with 30,000 well-armed warriors
be hind the Italian lines.
Scouts located the Ethiopian
force in the Eastern Tamhien re
gion, approximately 20 miles
northwest of Makale and 10 to 15
miles north of the Takkaze river,
along which the Italians are en
deavoring to consolidate a new
foi ward line.
Three native columns were rushed
across the mountains to meet the
first serious challenge to Italian oc
cupation in the north. Previous
flanking movements have been by
guerilla bands of a few hundred
i warriors, often armed with barred
spears and old-fashioned muskets.
Two columns of Eritrean Askaris
struck northwestward from Makale
while another native force worked
westward from their camp at
j Mount Gundi, near Hausien.
