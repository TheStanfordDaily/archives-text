### 
ASMARA, Eritrea, Nov. 18 (/P). —
Eye-witnesses returning from a bit
ter, day-long battle between tlie
Italian Danakil column and an Ethi
opian band near Azgi, on the north
ern front, said today the Ethiopians
had a chance to win the fight—but
missed.
These witnesses told the Asso
ciated Press that the outcome of
clash was for a long time in such
a doubt that General Oreste Mari
<>Ui was prepared to make a final,
desperate stand on a mountain top.
If the Ethiopians had not attacked
a camel-drawn battery, mistaking
it for a provisions train, they as
serted, the native defenders might
have emerged victorious.
The raiding warriors scattered in
the night, after lighting the invad
ers throughout the day of Novem
ber 12, permitting the Fascist
forces to occupy A/hi, just east of
Makalc.
