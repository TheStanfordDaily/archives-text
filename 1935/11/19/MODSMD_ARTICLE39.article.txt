# Soccer Teams Face 'Breather' Games
## Varsity Meets San Jose;' Frosh To Play Preps 
### Roger Kimball 
Polishing oil for their return games
with California on the Farm Satur
day, the Stanford varsity and fresh
man soccer teams will meet com
paratively slight opposition tomor
row.
Coach Dick Bullis' varsity tangles
with the San Jose State eleven at 3
o'clock on the field near the Sta
dium, and Dick Forhan's yearlings
will play Half Moon Bay an hour
later on the frosh football field.
Spartans Last
San Jose is the last in the league
standings and should not give the
Card soccermen too much trouble.
If Stanford defeats the Spartans to
morrow and the Bears Saturday she
can still take third place. U.S.F. has
cinched the championship, with
California second, San Mateo Junior
College third, and the Indians fourth.
The varsity looked good in prac
tice yesterday, and has a fair chance
to turn the tables on the Blue and
Gold. California wasn't five goals
better than the Indians in the Ber
keley game, and the Card defense
was much better than the score
indicates. The Bears had the Stan
ford offense bottled up throughout
the game, however.
Regulars Trim Reserves
Yesterday's scrimmage resulted in
a 2-1 victory for the regulars over
th" reserves. The former outfit was
composed of the first string, except
for the fullbacks and goalie, who
were second stringers. Only the two
fulls and the goal guard were regu
lais with the losing team.
Herb Sawyer, whose ankle was
sprained in the California game,
will probably start against San Jose
tomorrow, and is almost certain to
be in shape for the Bears on Big
Game morning. Mike Gomez, who
sustained a similar injury last week,
should be in uniform tomorrow, and
may be fully recovered by Saturday.
Half Moon Bay is not in a class
with Pescadero High, according to
reports, and will be a decided under
dog against the Card frosh.
