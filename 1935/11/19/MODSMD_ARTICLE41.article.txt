# Hoopsters Plan Night Work-out
## Nobs, Stoefen, Paine Vie For Center Position 
### 
Nightly scrimmage is the program
for Coach John Bunn's hoopsters,
who have been working out all fall
in preparation of what i.s considered
the best team Stanford has put out
for years. Bunn opens the basket
ball season December 22, with one
of the local teams.
The players, probably three or
four full teams, will stay at the Farm
over the Thanksgiving holidays and
the Christmas holidays. The sched
ule of conference games has not been
completed or okehed as yet.
Strongest position so far is center,
with Ken Nobs, Art Stoefen, and
Howard Paine nip-and-tuck for the
job.
Forwards are led by Sophomore
Hank Luisetti, and include Howell
Turner, Bill Quade, Sparky Robert
son, and Dick Lyon. At guard are
Dinty Moore, captain, Bob Zonne,
Andy Spears, Ken Bell, John Calder
wood, and Duane Edmonds.
