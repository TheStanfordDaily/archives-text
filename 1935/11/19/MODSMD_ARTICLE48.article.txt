WHO'S IN LINE
FOR THE BID?
The annual scurry for eastern
Rose Bowl opponents is now on in
earnest. It's obvious that Stanford
and California will battle it out for
the Pacific end, but who is in order
for the other half of that game in
| the Pasadena Bowl on New Year's
Day?
North Carolina — Marquette —
Syracuse—they are out of the pic
j ture now. For Duke drove to a
I neat 25-0 victory over the for
| merly unbeaten North Carolina
eleven last Saturday and Pop
Warner's Temple men annihilated
j Marquette 26-6 in another of the
week-end surprises. And Colgate
j wiped out Syracuse 27-0.
That leaves three unbeaten in the
! Far South and East—N.Y.U., Dart
j mouth, Princeton. And two of those
I are very, very doubtful. Princeton
i has already signified her non-inter
! est in the bid and N.Y.U. can hardly
bo given serious thought because her
J schedule is not representative of
i the eastern power in that sector.
So that leaves Dartmouth. The
Big Green Team meets Princeton
! a week from Saturday and if it
| comes out on top the Bowl bid
may be placed right there. But
Princeton is favored to take the
Indians and if she does, then what?
■j There is Holy Cross with one tie
I c.t;d Temple with one defeat, but both
j of those meet with the same argu
l rnent —they haven't played repre
sentative schedules.
Then there are the Fighting Irish
of Notre Dame with one defeat and
cne tie and Pittsburgh with the same
j record. Both may receive considera
| tion though both have games with
U.S.C. and thus are apt to decline a
I second intersectional meeting.
! So Dartmouth is the big east
! Crn hope. The Far South is com
pletely out. And now it begins to
look as if the Southwestern Con
| ference might yet get its crack at
i the Rose Bowl with two Texas
j teams. Southern Methodist and

| Texas Christian, standing with tilt
seven undefeated in the nation.
Here they are, with number of
wins, points scored by themselves
| and opponents:
Team W. Pts. OP
| Southern Methodist .... 9 213 18
Texas Christian 9 211 39
Dartmouth 9 289 25
New York U 7 206 26
Princeton 7 192 19

Which will it be—or will one ol
the several once defeated teams get
the call? —Frost

Which will it be—or will one ol

the call? —Frost
WHO'S IN LINE
FOR THE BID?
The annual scurry for eastern
Rose Bowl opponents is now on in
earnest. It's obvious that Stanford
and California will battle it out for
the Pacific end, but who is in order
for the other half of that game in
| the Pasadena Bowl on New Year's
Day?
North Carolina — Marquette —
Syracuse—they are out of the pic
j ture now. For Duke drove to a
I neat 25-0 victory over the for
| merly unbeaten North Carolina
eleven last Saturday and Pop
Warner's Temple men annihilated
j Marquette 26-6 in another of the
week-end surprises. And Colgate
j wiped out Syracuse 27-0.
That leaves three unbeaten in the
! Far South and East—N.Y.U., Dart
j mouth, Princeton. And two of those
I are very, very doubtful. Princeton
i has already signified her non-inter
! est in the bid and N.Y.U. can hardly
bo given serious thought because her
J schedule is not representative of
i the eastern power in that sector.
So that leaves Dartmouth. The
Big Green Team meets Princeton
! a week from Saturday and if it
| comes out on top the Bowl bid
may be placed right there. But
Princeton is favored to take the
Indians and if she does, then what?
■j There is Holy Cross with one tie
I c.t;d Temple with one defeat, but both
j of those meet with the same argu
l rnent —they haven't played repre
sentative schedules.
Then there are the Fighting Irish
of Notre Dame with one defeat and
cne tie and Pittsburgh with the same
j record. Both may receive considera
| tion though both have games with
U.S.C. and thus are apt to decline a
I second intersectional meeting.
! So Dartmouth is the big east
! Crn hope. The Far South is com
pletely out. And now it begins to
look as if the Southwestern Con
| ference might yet get its crack at
i the Rose Bowl with two Texas
j teams. Southern Methodist and

| Texas Christian, standing with tilt
seven undefeated in the nation.
Here they are, with number of
wins, points scored by themselves
| and opponents:
