# Central Speech Bureau Planned
## Ex Committee Will Hold Brief Meeting 
### 
Plans for the Stanford Speakers'
Bureau—the only measure sched
uled so far for the meeting—will be
outlined and discussed in tonight's
Ex Committee session.
The tentative plan calls for a
central bureau, handled probably
by the debate department, which
would be able to supply speakers
on short notice for high school
programs, business men's meet
ings, and other organizations
which ask for Stanford entertain
ment.
This bureau is definitely needed
says President Wally Bi-ooke. He
explains that no organization now
exists which can supply trained
speakers. Ex Committee will make
no final decision. They will merely
hear plans and offer suggestions.
Because of the short meeting,
the Round Table of Student Lead
ers will be held immediately after,
probably at 8 o'clock, in the Ex
Committee room.
Present at the discussion, whicl
will be "Ex Committee and Its Re
lation to the Union," will be th(
Union Board of Governors, Millarc
Browne and John Kline, associate
editors of The Daily, and Ex Com
mittee members.
