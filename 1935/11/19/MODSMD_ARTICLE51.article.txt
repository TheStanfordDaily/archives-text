# Bears Favored To Rout Water Poloists
## 
### 
For the first time since 1912, when j
Indian-Bear water polo rivalry was
just getting under way, California
will be favored to rout Stanford in
Saturday morning's battle at Encina
i Pools.
When the two spirited lank
squads clash at 10:45 o'clock, it
may be recalled that within the 23
| M'ars of their aquatic competition
the Indians have triumphed in <>9
panics, while the Berkeleyites have
scored but two victories.
The Bears will enter the Farm
i tank Saturday as favorites in water
j polo's Brg Game solely because of
, the 8-2 win they scored over the In-
I dians more than a month ago. They,
| however, will find a sizzling recep-
J tion awaiting them, for since the
j Farm tanksters last tussled with
; California, Coach Nort Thornton has
! brought about various and sundry
j changes in liis Stanford aggregation.
Among other things, he has re
i arranged the line-up and restyled
the Indian attack, with the result
that comparative scores during the
past month put the Indians on ap
proximately an even standing with
the Californians.
The Bruins, Pacific Coast Confer
ence champions since last Saturday,
have downed U.C., 3-2 and 4-3.
j Stanford, it seems, has fared some
i what better against the mighty
j Uclans, for although the Indians
i went down to the tune of 5-3 before
l a Bruin onslaught, they were able to
I hold the Westwoodites scoreless un
i til the closing moments of their sec
j ond tilt, but ultimately lost, 1-0.
Admitting that an X-2 drubbing
can't he laughed off, Stanford
should take to the water Saturday
more evenly matched with the

Bears and more determined to
emerge victorious than dopesters
have indicated.
The mermen will be fighting it out
this week-end for second place in
the Coast league. An Indian victory
would boost the Redskins to a tie
with the Bears for that honor; a
loss, on the other hand, would put
Stanford in third place.
Doctors and nurses in Moscow,
are learning parachute jumping so
that they may attend medical cases
in remote districts.
