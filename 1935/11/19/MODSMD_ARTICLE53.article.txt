## Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily Goal Posts Cost $57.975 a Pair B.A.C. To Maintain New Policy, But May Atone for Suddeness of Change 
### 
A stream of protests by ticketless students
who do not relish the prospect of seeing the
Big Game via radio has penetrated into Board
of Athletic Control sensitivities to the extent
that the B.A.C. has called a special meeting
for 10 o'clock this morning to discuss ways
and means of providing students with ducats
at a cheaper rate than the regular $3.30 or
$4.40 fees.
One proposed plan calls for selling regular
seats at the $l.f>o rooters' price, plus the
necessary 30 or 40 cents federal tax, or.a total
cost of $1.80 or $1.90 —a negligence penalty
of a poor seat and 15 or 2~) cents rather than
*1 . (>f> or $2.7.") in cash. At any rate, the Board
may possibly make some slight atonement
for the suddenness of its reversal in policy.
This B.A.C. "crack-down" and prompt (dos
ing of student sale last week was, to be truth

ful, in part i)AiLY-suggested. The B.A.C. feels
justified in this new policy, and rightfully will
continue it in Ihe future.
But student contention now is that the Big
Game is no time to initiate such a stringent
program, especially when leniency has pre
vailed for many seasons, including llie lirsl
part of this one. Furthermore, extenuating
j circumstances of little warning to Ihe stu
dents and the many students being oil-cam
pus in this case should he swaying factors.
Since the Board's special session today may
take cognizance of the fact that, after all. loot
hall is played by and was originally designed
for the students, not the general public, those
partially negligent students who for once were
mistaken in the belief that the B.A.C. was
"crying wolf" still may get their chance to
see the Big Came.
