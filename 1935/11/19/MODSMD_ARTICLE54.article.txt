# Farm's Idea of Spirit Different, Yet Effective
## 
### 
Willi a new coach and a hunch of football
hungry sophomores, California has romped
through the season and now finds only the Big
(lame obstructing her Hose Bowl path, a situ
ations comparahle to that at Stanford in 1933.
Many claim this has heen made possible by
alifornia's student spirit, which also is analo
gous to the Farm's set-up two years ago.
The big difference, however, is that Cali
fornia spirit as displayed this year is a inore
or-less normal thing on the Berkeley campus;
Stanford's enthusiasm in 1933 was unusual
lor flic Farm.
California has always been proud of her
spirit. Her rooting section yells louder and
longer, her students practice cheering and
singing in classes every Friday, her loyal
boosters mount the football team on a pedes
tal, look upon it as a thing apart, omnipotent.
Consequently, the Blue and Cold, with a
lighting, rough and ready team of sopho
mores, backed by a student body with a "won
derful spirit," cannot help but â€¢win from
"blase Stanford, manned by some individual
stars, true, but lacking in the vigor of youth."
This is the attitude California radiates as
she prepares for the Big Came.
Stanford looks at this spirit business in a
slightly difTerent light, however. True, the
Farm has begun to lake the football team for
granted; true, also, are the facts that Stanford
does not devote class time to singing and
cheering and that she considers the football
players that represent her, the ones that have
played in the past two Hose Bowl games, to
be jusl another portion of her student body.
No, Stanford as a rule is not overtly foot
ball-conscious. The capacity for deep - felt
"rah-rahism," however, is not totally lacking.
The Indians bring it to the surface only on
occasion, the theory being that spirit of the
prep-school variety is a thing that is easily
overworked, soon becomes tiresome and loses
effectiveness.
'I his year's Washington game, which eli
maxed one of those rare displays of Stanford
spirit, and for that matter the scores of the
past ten Big (James, seem rather convincing
evidence of the practical value of the Farm's
doctrine regarding "rah - rails." Saturday's
contest will be one more round in the battle
between the Stanford and California concep
tions of spirit.
