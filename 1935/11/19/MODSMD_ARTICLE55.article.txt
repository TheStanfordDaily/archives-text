# "Prex Dex" Proves Most Unorthodox College Head
## 
### 
Victorious sophomores in llu* frosh-so I'll
lug-01-war ;it Heed College (Portland, Ore.)
:i year ago were somewhat surprised to find
that one of the "freshmen" they had been
dragging through the mud was none other
than their new college president, Dexter Kee
ner.
Kee/er was no academic dullard, America's
â– weekly newsmagazine reports, having had

live years on metropolitan newspapers and a
year in the service of NBA between his Am
herst graduation in 102(1 and his acceptance
of the Beed College post in 1934.
"Prex I)cx bested even his own previous
vagaries by appearing on campus in bright
red duck trousers. In his lirsl spring term he
tennised and fished with his students, even
inaugurated a carnival and several skiing
parties. .Justifying his actions to bookworms,
he recalled that "you don't live on intellect
alone."
A little chagrined by Heed's smallness, this
livewire prexy lashed out against unethical
colleges which make invidious comparisons
with their competitors, which use scholar
ships to entice students away from other in
stitutions, and which employ solicitors to
seek admission applicants on a commercial
basis.
He found grim humor in that NBA held it
inappropriate to have a code of fair compe
tition for institutions of higher learning, and
yet his experience showed that methods used
bv industries for which such codes were re
garded as highly necessary "have about them
a positive aura ol sitnetity" when compared
with cutthroat tactics that some colleges use
in recruiting students.
\\ ith no particular lesson to be learned
Iroin "Prex l)e\" here on the Farm, it is still
pleasant to be able to see a livewire in action,
to find someone somewhere not afraid to kick
over the traces of social convention if bene
fits may accrue thereby.
