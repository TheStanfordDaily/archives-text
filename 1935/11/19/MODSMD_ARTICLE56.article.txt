The Rally boys should invoke their picket
And angle for me a Big Game ticket.
—Very Old Ballad
Right in the midst of Save Tradition week, the
B.A.C. broke a long-established custom, threw habit
and custom to the very winds, and refused to reopen
a ticket-selling campaign after it had been "positively
closed for the last time." Whoops.
Because of the Big Game ticket controversy it is
reported that leaders of the Stanford Band have re
ceived over the week-end a tremendous increase in
applications for membership in that musical organ
ization.
This brings to mind the story of a student last year
who had an irresistible craving to wear a red and
white uniform, whose feet itched and hair wove every
time the little jackets of red marched by and borned
bum beat the cymbals.
Oh who can resist the subtle appeal
Of the animal cry of the glockenspiel?
—Older and Funnier Ballad
Finally, the student broke down under the strain
of sleepless nights and sleepless 8-o'clocks. He bought
a horn at the college clothing shop, and signed up.
Regrettably enough, he did not know how to play it,
but he pursed his lips, ballooned out his cheeks, and
heaved his chest from coast to coast; at Berkeley, at
U.C.L.A . and in the Rose Bowl, and nobody suspected
a thing.
Things have come to such a pretty pash
Tlie Great Big Game I'll have to crash.
—I wrote this myself.
