Those playful little fellows, who heat their larynxes
in Paly movies and cool them in the Paly jail, proffer
just the kind of justification for their conduct that
shrewd observers have predicted they would.
When they have finished being outraged and speech
less with the injustice of their arrest, they take off on
a beautifully inferential explanation that, after all, in
Paly movies are being run for college kids, that towns
people get a kick out of balcony-cut-ups, and that
in making his arrests Chief Zink and his nightstick
boys are following a small-town procedure analogous
to ticketing the wealthy out-of-towner for traffic
violations.
Furthermore, these pests will explain with a wink,
it's amazing how the volume and juiciness of their razz
berries vary with the quality of the picture.
All of which rationalizing, besides being untrue, is a
pretty good example of the defense of any spoiled
brat at any age.

In the first place, Palo Alto, besides being a college
town, is a pretty big town, a town that might be able
to get along in A.D. 1935 without the questionable aid
of college kids. It is a town, moreover, populated with
a tremendous number of grown men and women. The
fact that they may not all be doting papas and mamas,
who love to hear juvenile racket all the live-long day
and night, seems entirely to escape Stanford's balcony
burlesquers.

Chief Zink, to make our rebound complete, is not
the goateed and suspicious country "constabule" that
offending students would have us believe. Neither is
he a prude. He's a pretty reasonable guy, reasonable
enough, anyway, to know an incipient panic when he
hears one and to do something about it.
His cinematic reign of terror did not spring from
purely personal aggravation. He instituted it as an
emergency measure to quell an audience that was rap
idly being goaded to frenzy by the screaming and bel
lowing of Stanford's intellectual idiots who took ad
vantage of sudden darkness and the implied disaster
of a severe storm. He cannot be criticized because he
intends to avoid a recurrence of such circumstances,
and because he wants to grant movie-goers their right
to pa id-for entertainment.

But the movie racketeer's final argument, that noise
increases in direct proportion to the badness of the
picture, is so specious that it hardly requires comment.
This Bull Sessioner has sat. through two of the year's
best pictures, so declared by a consensus of critical
opinion, and strained his ears trying to tune out .static
from balcony hams.
It indicated to him that there is no correlation be
tween picture and racket, but that there might be a
correlation between a night in jail and silence.
