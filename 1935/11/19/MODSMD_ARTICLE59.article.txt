| The Editor, Sir:
Just a request. While on the sub
' ject of traditions, there is one more
j 1 would like to bring to the attention
j of our cheer leaders.
After we win the game Saturday
j i.nd go across the field, I wish we
I might do as has been done in tlie
I past, and serpentine. A serpentine,
i to be done half way decently, should
go with about four or five abreast.
This would be a little better than
our usual disorganized, sluggish,
! mob movement directly across the
j field!
| Also, just because this is the Cal
! game, we don't need to use the "Axe"
| for every first down.
