# Theater Head Opposes Zink
## 
### 
G. H. Techemeyer, manager of the
Stanford Theater, yesterday .said that
he was opposed to the action of
Police Chief Howard Zink in posting
plain clothes men in the audience to
nab vociferous Stanfordites and
march them down to the local bastile.
According to Techemeyer, the
movement to forcibly restrain the
Roughs was entirely Zink's idea, and
theater officials have had no hand
in the proceedings. Furthermore, he
believes that the theater manage
ment is entirely capable of handling
the situation as they have done in
the past, and desires that the police
interference be withdrawn as soon
as possible.
Meanwhile, police officials, in the
absence of Chief Zink, reiterated
their statement that they would con
tinue to clamp down on disturbers
until Zink feels that the booing and
hissing has been completely stopped.
No arrests have been made since last
Saturday night, when two Stanford
men were arrested at the Varsity
Theater.
