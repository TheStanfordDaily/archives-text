# HOW TO BE A PIONEER
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
May I offer a comment on Mr.
Eaton's letter on "What Kind of
War" in a recent Daily.
I do not believe that one's opposi
tion to war necessarily has to have
the element of discrimination in it.
. . . I believe that war is a "horrible
phenomenon, to the same degree
foolish and unjustified at all times,
in all places, and with regard to all
who engage in it."
This slant tells me that great ter
i itorial expansion, riches, inflation of
Ihe national ego, and untold political
powers count for nothing against the
value of the life of the humblest sol
dier.
Mr. Eaton's second point is on the
well known one of "self-defense."
An examination of military tactics
will reveal the fact that an offense is
the best defense. When I hear some
one say he doesn't believe in war
except in self-defense, he really says
"I believe in war whole-heartedly,"
for any true element of self defense
is surely lost the way modern de
fensive war is fought.
I admire Mr. Eaton's concession
that Christian meekness" is an ex
cuse for putting aggression and de

| ferise on the same plane. ... I have
the greatest admiration for one who
has the strength to oppose the mil-
I lions with his "meekness." The one
who bucks the current now is the
I pioneer of a new era.
