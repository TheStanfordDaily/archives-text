WAGNERS RING CYCLE, pre
; sen ted for (he third time in San
] Francisco s history, opened the sea
son given by the San Francisco Op- 1
j era Company, and each of the four !
; operas which make up the cycle was
reviewed by a different Daily critic.
All agreed that Kirsten Flagstad,
the great Wagnerian soprano, was
the outstanding singer of the com
pany. "Her Brunnhilde was majes- i
tic, said one. "She showed re
markable depth.' "The security of
her tones is miraculous," said an
other.
Next to Flagstad, Lauritz Melchior j
received the greatest praise, and
Kathryn Meisle was also applauded.
Highest praise was given Technical
Director Armando Agnini for his
realistic scenery and effects. The
staging, all agreed, was most excel- |
lent.
