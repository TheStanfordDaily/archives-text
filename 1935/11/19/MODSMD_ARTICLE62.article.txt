# AUTO-LESS PROGRESSIVISM
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
There are certain progressive col
leges and universities which have
! prohibited the use of automobiles by
the undergraduates.
Would you please publish the
j names of these schools? I would
; like to select a college from this list
| for reasons of character, safety, and
| expense.
I For the colleges which ignore this
matter I might suggest that they
could help in another way. Grant
ing that "keeping up with the Jones
es" is quite worth while, it is a
l thought that the "automobile col
leges" should spare the parents the
avoidable expense of tuition. More
social contacts would be possible if
i all classes for these four years were
eliminated.
