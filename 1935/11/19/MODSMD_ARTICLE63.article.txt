# WHO ARE THEY?

The Editor, Sir:
Who is this fellow, John M. Fuller?
I am not trying to be funny, nor is
this a wise-crack from a defeated
candidate, but an honest question
from a freshman. Before I leave the
topic, who are some of the other
fellows and girls who were nomi
nated for the various offices of out
class of '39, and were either elected
or defeated?
Maybe I'm wrong, but I would
certainly like to see or at the very
least hear something about those
who are going to partially control
my activities this year.
I have never met, seen, or heard of
Fuller, or for that matter of Florence
Brown, until Wednesday's "Daily"
announced that they had been elect
ed as Class of '39 officers. . . .
A Frosh
