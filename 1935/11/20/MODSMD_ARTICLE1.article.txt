# Ex Committee Okehs Bureau For Speakers
## Grants Made to W.A.A., Women's Conference In Constitution Three Dates Granted Game Jolly-up, Song, Axe Ceremony Approved 
### 
To fill requests for Stanford en
tertainment, a Speakers' Bureau was
last night endorsed by Ex Commit
tee in a record short session. Fur
ther plans will be discussed at next
week's meeting.
"It's a good idea—more students
should have an opportunity to speak,
as it's fine* experience," observed
Bobby Grayson.
Tentative plans have the bureau
connected with the debate council.
A review board will be established
to judge qualifications of the speak
ers, and any student will be able to
sign up. No credit will be given un
til the plan is found workable.
WOMEN STUDENTS' FUNDS,
tabled last time, were piovided for
in the current constitution. They
had been omitted from the hand
book, but were inserted in the by
laws as they appeared two years
ago. The provisions merely include
minimum grants to the W.A.A. and
Women's Conference.
CARDINAL MINUTES, discuss
ing the jolly-up, a song to the tunc
of "The Old Gray Mare," and the
Axe Ceremony, were okehed. The
traditional Big Game token of vic
tory will be presented, if necessary,
by the student body president and
four members of the Cardinals.
KALLY COMMITTEE minutes
passed without question, except for
audible groans from woman mem
bers as it was announced that wom
en will sit at the top of the rooting
section.
DATES GRANTED included In
terfraternity Pledge Dance, Janu
ary 17; Union Club, January 31;
Lagunita formal, February 21.
A PRIVATE PHONE for business
matters will be installed in Bob
Gros' apartment, decided Ex Com
mittee.
"It's a darned nuisance, but I'll
gel up to talk to The Daily or about
Honor Code at 12 o'clock every
night, if necessary," promised Gros.
"How'd it be if we moved your bed
up to the office?" inquired Frank
Fullenwidcr.
ROUND TABLE of Student Lead
ers was postponed until after next
Tuesday's meeting because of the
absence of Almon E. Roth. Subject
for discussion will be "The Union
and Its Relation to Ex Committee."
VIOLATION OF RULES govern
ing off-campus parties can not be
handled adequately, decided the
group. Gros suggested that permis
sion be required whenever a mem
ber gives a party for the organiza
tion, to prevent "fixing." "I know of
one eating club president who did
n't have enough money to ride from
here to Paly, but he gave a dance,"
"We should have power of pro
bation, but how can we prove
they're guilty?" he continued. Ex
Committee concluded that the best
policy was to "scare 'em" as much as
possible. "Impossible — they think
I'm just a joke. They read about
me in The Daily, - ' countered Gros.
L.l.D.'s DISSATISFACTION with
Ex Committee's refusal to allow
them to publish a paper will go
unanswered. They demanded a list
of specific reasons instead of the
"vague and inadequate rationaliza
tions for denying our request."
"I move we ignore it," said Fullen
v.'idcr. "We've given It enough
time already, and so have Wilbur
and Roth."
