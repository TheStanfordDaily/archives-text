## 
### R. B. JONES 
Fire broke out in a room in Encina
Jiall last evening when Spencer
Grant accidentally ignited some spilt
lighting fluid.
Having knocked over a can of
lighting fluid and kicked the fast
emptying can out into the hall.
Grant lighted a cigarette with his
newly filled lighter. The ensuing
flame was too close to the fluid, and
it ignited in a burst of flame.
At this point the telephone buzzer
rang, and the Encina roomer was

unable to make up his mind whether
to answer what might have been an
important call or to put out the fast,
growing blaze. In anticipation of a
pie-Big Game bonfire the latter
was decided upon.
Both fire hose and extinguisher
were used, but ihe only actual dam -
age done to the room was a burnt,
lug; the rest of the room belonging
1') Steve Taggart, Spencer Grant.
Mid Gardner Gray was scarred a
