# Invalids Return To Aid Red Toboggan
## 
### Herb Diamond 
It's not going to be just another
football game.
At least that's the impression Tiny
Thornhill gave last night as he put
his business-like gridsters through
another stiff session in preparation
for Saturday's pigskin classic. Tiny
knows that the Big Red Machine
faces a crucial test thus week-end if
there ever was one.
So he's been putting the last
couple of evenings to excellent ad
vantage on the practice grid.
Since Monday evening he's been
converting into action his plans for
Big Game week.
As a result, his warriors have
been up in the air, literally. For
the chief festivities have centered
about aerial tactics, both offensive
and defensive.
No Injuries Risked
Earlies in the week Tiny an
nounced that he wasn't going to risk
a single scrimmage on the practice
turf because of the possibility of
injuries. No scrimmages, but plenty
of hard work just the same; and
that's been the situation thus far.
The sick list, which included
only three names since the tussle
with the Grizzlies, has rapidly
dwindled. Tex Luckctt and Niels
Larsen had to turn out in sweat
suits instead of their regular uni
forms last night to make the team
complete for the first time in sev
eral weeks.
Luckett's pulled muscle is still
giving him more than a little trouble,
and the condition of Larson's char
ley-horse will have to improve
somewhat before he'll be in the pink,
but spectators were encoui'aged,
nevertheless, in seeing the squad
virtually cripple-free.
Find New Headgear
True, Bones Hamilton was still ca
vorting around with his broken nose
and black eyes. But the fearful con
:raf*'on Bones was wearing Monday
has been traded in for a specially
constructed head gear. The new
helmet shields his face well by
breaking any and all shocks. At
the same time, it gives Hamilton a
chance to breathe easily.
Bones and Bobby Grayson will
probably enter the Big Game at
right half and fullback, respec
tively. Bill Pauhnan is likely to
get the call at quarterback, but
whether Joe Vigna or little Jimmy
Coffis will hold down the left
halfback post is a matter for con
jecture.
Coffis has hung up an enviable
record at that, spot this season but
there is always the possibility that
Vigna may be shifted from right
half, where he's been subbing for
Hamilton lately.
Bears Arrive Early
Stub Allison will bring his Bears
; to the Farm this year a full day
: before their encounter with the Big
i Red Machine. The Californians will
work out on the stadium turf Fri
day afternoon while Thornhill is
winding up the Indians' practice
about a block away. Friday eve
ning the squad will go into seclu
sion, not to appear again until Big
I Game time.
Since Stanford and California
' will be battling it out for a possible
] Rose Bowl bid among other things,
the contest should be a tooth and
nail battle from beginning to end.
i General consensus still indicates that
the two traditional rivals will trot
onto the field more evenly matched
I ban they've ever been before.
