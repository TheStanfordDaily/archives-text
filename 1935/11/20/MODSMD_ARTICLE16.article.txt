# Big Game Pyre Building Slated For Tomorrow
## Upperclassmen To Help Frosh In Erecting Pile 
### 
Tomorrow morning at 8 o'clock
construction on the Big Game bon
fire will be started. Since the whole
thing must be built in one day all
those who want to participate in
the erection of the traditional pyre
must do so tomorrow. Unlike last
year, when the freshmen did all the
work on the bonfire, upperclassmen
are strongly urged to go out and
aid the Class of '39 in the huge task.
Phil Zonne, freshman repre
sentative on the bonfire commit
tee, said last night that all frosh
are expected to come out and
help with the construction, as a
great many workers are needed,
and they should not depend on the
upperclassmen to do all of the
work.
The eleven telephone poles, do
nated by P. G. and E., have already
been set up by workers of that
company. The bonfire will have a
base 36 feet square, which means
that it will be slightly larger than
last year's. At each corner are to be
placed railroad ties immediately in
side the poles.
Bob Hoover, bonfire chairman,
stated that all wood that can be
secured will be used in the pyre.
He asked that anyone who is able
to contribute fuel, or who knows
where there is some available
combustible material, phone in to
one of the conunittce, who will ar
range to move it. Those who
should be informed arc George
Ditz and Frank Price, who are in
charge of the construction; Bill
Rockwell, the Sequoia representa
tive; Harmon Howard and Mike
Gonzalez, truck and filler commit
tee; and Web Jones and Jim Ran
sohofT, publicity committee.
A lunch, consisting of sandwiches,
potato salad, cookies, ice cream, and
candy will be served to the bonfire
workers between 12:15 and 1 o'clock,
announces Jcannette Munkelt, mem
ber of the food committee, last night.
The candy was donated by the Ghir
ardelli Co. and the Beach Nut Gum
Co. The food will be handled by a
group of 40 girls 30 freshmen and
10 transfers, who will serve over 200
men. Also on the food committee
arc Adrienne Johnston and Peggy
Sim.
