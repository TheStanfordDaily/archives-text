# Yells, Songs, Skits Boost Game Rally
## 
### 
Tomorrow at 6:30 o'clock yelling,
booming, flaring, blaring through
the campus will go Stanford's Rose
Bowl hopes for a victory this week
end. YelLs, horns and bells will
mark the Indians' war dance toward
the Pavilion rally.
Yells, songs, and skits will com
bine in lapid fire order for the big
gest rally of the year when hopeful
braves and maidens gather to fire
their warriors to fighting pitch.
Phil Coghlan, chairman of the
Pally Committee, announced last
night that Paul Speegle, versatile
'29 yell leader and hit of last year's
Big Game rally, will head the list of
pep speakers. "Doodles" Weaver,
campus clown, has written a new
song which is thought to be even
better lhan "Nuts to Cal," with
which he amused the campus last,
year.
Members of the varsity line—the
much touted, never over-praised
Stanford forward wall—are also ex
pected to speak at this rally of ral
lies. Also to speak is Bill Corbus,
all-American guard of '33. All of
these speakers will be heard over a
new and much improved public ad-,
dress system.
Following the rally all students
v/ill proceed to the site of the bon
fire which, according to Co-chairmen
Bob Jones and Bob Hoover, will be
the biggest in ten years.
The Axe—in case of an unexpected
loss—will be handed over to Cali
fornia by Wally Brooke, A.S.S.U,
president, and four Cardinals. The
ceremony will be performed under
the Stanford rooting section.
