Special Session Decides
This was the decision of the Board
of Athletic Control, which met in
special session yesterday morning to
listen to protests of students who
had failed to get tickets before the
I regular sale closed over a week ago.
The new block of rooters' seats
will be reduced from the regular
1 $3.30 price to $1.80, including 30
cents federal tax which is levied on
the $3 face value.
B.A.C. officials made it clear that
the board was not reversing its new

policy of stopping rooters' sale on
the announced dale, but that the
move was purely a concession, and
that the special date will be con
ducted only so that there will be no
possibility of vacant seats which
students might be occupying Sat
urday.
Limited to Sections
Ticket purchasers will be strictly
limited to their own seats. Rally
Committeemen will see to it that no
"A" section student attempts to oc
cupy a regular rooter's seat in Sec
tion D. The B.A.C. has arranged
for an auditor's check on all students
buying seats to further protect those
possessing Section A tickets, it was
announced.
No student whose registration card
is already punched will be permit
ted to buy one of the new $1.80
tickets; furthermore, students will
not be permitted to trade regular
$3.30 or $4.40 seats for the new
rooters' tickets, since Saturday was
the last day these ducats could be
turned in, officials added.
