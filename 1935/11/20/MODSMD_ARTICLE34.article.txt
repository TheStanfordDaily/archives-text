# Zink Refuses To Withdraw Police; Patrons Back Him
## 
### 
Police Chief Howard Zink said
yesterday that no officers would be
withdrawn from local theaters at
the present time, despite the opposi
tion of Stanford students and theater
managers.
He explained his position on the
grounds that it was theater patrons,
not the management, that had ob
jected to the disturbances, and it
would be necessary to retain plain
clothes men in the theater until he
feels assured that booing and hiss
ing will not be revived.
The University of Minnesota has
its own newsreel theater.
