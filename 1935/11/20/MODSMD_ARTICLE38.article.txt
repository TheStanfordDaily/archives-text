# Indians Defy Bear Threat In Tank Tilt
## Water Poloists Set For Game Saturday 
### 
California water poloisls will in
vade the Indian stronghold at Encina
Pools Saturday morning determined
to carry out their coach's publicized
threat that "they can beat hell out
of those red-shirts any lime.''
But the Bear septet, whether
they know it or not, will clash with
a Stanford squad that is equally
henl upon scoring a triumph.
Thus when the two tank outfits
paddle it out Saturday morning at
lft:4s o'clock, a repetition of the
air-tight water polo displayed in
the Cardinal-Uclan tussle can he
expected.
To the winner of the conflict will
go second place honors in the Pa
cific Coast Conference. The Bruins,
by gaining two successive victories
last week-end, proved themselves
league titlists for the first time in the
history of Coast water polo compe
tition. In nosing out the Indians
1-0 during the final 40 seconds of
last week's tilt they submerged
Stanford's hopes for anything better
than second place in the league.
Coach Nort Thornton's Cardi
nals earlier this season dropped an
X-2 decision to A1 Dowden's Ber
keleyites, and it is that loss alone
that gives California a slight edge
in water polo's Big (lame Satur
day. So Stanford won't find it any
too easy to prove her aquatic
prowess and carry off the victory
she needs to gain runner-up hon
ors in the Coast conference.
