YELL AT THE
i RIGHT TIME—TINY
| To Stanford Cheer Leaders
I Gentlemen:
I overheard Tiny Thornhill chat
ling with Don Liebendorfer yester
day morning abput the rooting sec
tion as it performed last Saturday.
His words might be of interest to
you.
Said Tiny in effect, "I hope those
j yell leaders work with us next
I week-end better than they did last
! Saturday. If they don't we're go
j in;; to have a hell of a lot of
trouble. Remember how many
j times our linemen beat the hall
| on the charge? Remember how
| ragged our shift looked on some of
| those plays? Well, you know
| what caused that. Don.
"Most of those fellows couldn't
hear the "hike" when they came up
to the line, there was so much noise
from the rooting section. It balled
up the whole set-up."
Now it appears from what Tiny
has said earlier in the year that
he's all for the rooting section.
But the reason they are doing
that yelling is to help the team, not
to hinder it. Tiny himself is not
| apt to come to you and ask for
co-operation; the difficulty isn't
that serious. But Tiny — and the
whole football gang—will appre
i ciftte your help.
It should bo understood, fellows,
! that all this is meant as construc
: tive criticism, that it's not intended
i to imply that you haven't done a
i good job in encouraging the team
| through the use of yells. It's under
| stood that you've succeeded there,
j especially wilh that rally which in
j directly won the Washington game.
But now it comes down to some
j thing more than just yelling. It's
j yelling at the right time. And
just that is liable to have a lot of
bearing on Stanford's showing
I against the mighty California
Bears three days hence. The
cheers themselves arc not the big
worry. It's what we call "chatter"
j that must be watched.
Here's a suggestion. Lead yells
fast and furiously except for just
one time—that's from the second the
team goes into the huddle till the
ball is snapped. And during that
time do everything in your power to
maintain utmost quiet. As far as
the section is concerned, it's pretty
certain you'll find co-operation there.
This week-end is the big blast.
Plenty of talk-up. hitting those
,\clls hard at the right times, will

help a lot when Stanford faces the
big test Saturday. And quiet at
the right times will he worth a
plenty, too.
Sincerely,
G.F.
| THEY ALL HAVE
SUGGESTIONS
Suggestion letters, more than 150
of them, have been pouring into
; Tiny's mail box lately with all man
ner of solutions on the current prob
lem, "How to win the Big Game."
Some tell him to use spread
formations, where the team lines
up from sideline to sideline, as the
only way to break through Cal's
line. Others suggest a fancy for
mation for receiving the kick-off
1 and running it right back for the
score. Two or three put forth
plays that would take two weeks
to develop and could be used only
once. And then there arc a few
that sound swell on paper but
haven't a prayer to work when in
practice.
A. lot of them make early trips to
lhe waste basket but there are a
lot of others that really go into
practice. Some, from men in whom
Tiny has faith, offer advice that
comes in mighty handy.
But good or bad, Thornhill con
fesses that he likes to get 'em—just
so they don't ask for answers.
