# Finishing Touches Put on Angell Field
## 
### 
Finishing touches are being put on t
Stanford's new $23,000 Angell Field J
this week.
Thus marks the climax of a long
j campaign for a new Stanford track
! and field unit, and the finished prod
j uct that now stands in the same
spot that time-worn Angell Field
| No. 1 occupied, is easily classed ;
j with America's finest running ovals.
Dink Tcmplcton, head Stanford
track coach, is convinced that it's
absolutely unparalleled. Sam
McDonald, supervisor of construc- )
tiun on the new unit, pronounces I
it his best effort. But the actual
proof of its quality will come next i
! spring when spikes first cut the
i new half-cinder, half-clay sur
! face.
That running surface was eare-
I fully laid down early this week,
i packed, rolled, and made ready for
| trial. But before it can actually be
1 tested many days of weathering
I must pass. Supervisor McDonald is
! not positive just when the track will
, be ready for use, his final okay not
| to be given until winter rains and
! spring sun have settled the surface
j to suit him.
There still remains a few clean-

up jobs on the new layout, those
tn he taken care of in the next
two or three weeks. Outside fenc
ing. work on the turf, painting the
rail and runway sideboards, and
other relatively unimportant mat
ters will soon be put out of tlit*
way.
In the new unit Stanford can
boast probably the most carefully
planned and executed track job in
the country, if not the world. Mr.
McDonald, Stanford supervisor of
yards and buildings, under whose
hand the work was done, is a vet
eran at such undertakings.
