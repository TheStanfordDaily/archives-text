# Stanford Runners Will Race Cal Team
## 
### 
Climax of the 1935 cross-country I
season for the Stanford harriers will
be Thursday afternoon when they j
meet the University of California j
over a 312-mile route at the golf
course, starting at 4 p.m. on the first
fairway.
Added incentive to the runners
will be the fact that they must place
in this meet to receive their Circle
"S" for this season.
Arle Davis of Oklahoma kicked 23 I
points from placement in one i
gameâ€”Oklahoma vs. Kingfisher in
1917. Final balance sheet: Okla- l
homa 179, Kingfisher 0.
