# Webster Beats the Greeks With Six Words for It
## 
### 
According to well-founded rumor there is
to he a football game come Saturday here on
the Farm that is arousing some little local
and national interest, being variously classed
as "The Greatest of Big Gaines," a gargantuan
battle of spirit," and whatnot.
Yesterday Kallvinen plastered the campus
with "Heat Ihe Hears" stickers. Lust night, it
is reported, someone even spread a few right
under the shadow of the Campanile.
Old grads mutter that "spirit" is not what
it was in the days when the axe was a rusty,
fought-ovcr symbol of student bravado, rather
than a polished award for victory.
"Spirit" is a much-lalked-of, little-under
stood word. The one of the twenty Webste
rian meanings of the word which approaches
nearest the sense meant in "student spirit" is
"liveliness, energy, vivacity, ardor, enthu
siasm, courage."
Seldom does Stanford go ga-ga over its
football team. Hut this does not connote any
lack of appreciation; throughout history, as
tute observers have noted that the loudest
praisers are usually those who appreciate
least.
Forced displays of "spirit" and appeals for
them are hollow. Hither students appreciate
their team, or they do not. Beneath their
placid indifference, most Stanford students
probably are willing to stand by their team.
That the team will strive to the utmost
Saturday is a foregone conclusion. That the
students will compose an enthusiastic, sports
manlike section is equally certain. That,
without overconlidence, without hutlaballoo,
the football team will tight to another victory
over Cal cannot be reasonablv doubted.
