## 
### 
With Ihe announcement that work on re
modeled Angell Field will be completed this
week, Stanford track men are optimistically
looking toward a spring season when they can

work out on the finest practice track in the
West.
The $23,000 project, which brings the lime
worn plant up to date and accurate in every
detail, will not he available lor workouts until
early in Ihe spring when the clay-cinder sur
face lias sufficiently weathered.
Thus climaxes a campaign that was inaug
urated to help keep Stanford's track reputa
tion at the same peak it lias held during the
past decade.
