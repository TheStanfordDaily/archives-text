It is said that Encinamen, in carrying on their
campaign for freedom of screech in the Paly Theater,
have developed the art of blowing the nose loudly
and long to a fine point.
Over in the Dean of Men's office are various and
sundry articles of clothing for needy college students,
among which are many tux shirts.
On tlit* back of the N Y.A. checks, now being dis
bursed in the main foyer, is the note: "Signatures
signed by 'X' must be witnessed by two persons who
can write."
It's wonderful what a college education can do.
Wandering into a biology lab recently was a mangey
white alley cat. The instructor purposed to see what
made >t tick, but a sentimental Robleite would have
none of it, guaranteed to take it away so it wouldn't
pester the biologists anymore. At 9 o'clock that night,
unable to secure entrance to the hall with her feline,
the woman was seen wandering in a comatose state
through the wind and the rain, clutching her precious
animal in her arms. Finally, fate overtook the wraith
like form and the Robleite was seen down at the Paly
Pound, paying 50 cents to have the cat sent to meet
its Maker by the best means known to science.
Seen walking home from the Roble Formal Friday
night was a Phi Delt sophomore, mincing along in
stocking feet carrying his shoes in his hand. Terrific
dancing took its toll.
On hand Our Hasher has various memoranda sent
in by prospective H-men in regard to liquor, love,
and larceny. Senders may have same back by appear
ing in person and explaining what's funny about them.
