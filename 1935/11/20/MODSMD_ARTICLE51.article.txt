## DOOMED TO A LIFETIME OF DEBT 
### 
While we of the college generation ... go blithely
along our four-year way of preparing for future liveli
| hoods . . . the fleeting occupations of the moment make
us unheeding to the activities of a man and his gov
ernment in Washington . . . who are designing our
j future in multi-numbered figures of red.
♦ Hi * *
The government debt of Franklin Roosevelt's ad
ministration, piling up into incomprehensible millions,
: must someday be paid off. And we who will have '3G,
, '37, '38, and '39 after our names on the college rolls
will be there at the pay-ofT contributing a huge slice
of our incomes as long as we are able to write our
names on tax returns. Mark Sullivan claims the elec
tion of Roosevelt will be looked upon by historians as
one of the chief reasons for the holding back of re
covery. That commentator might well have added that
the present president will be looked upon as the man
who mortgaged the future of his children and his
children's children.
* * * *
The fact that during the 20-year period preceding
Roosevelt's election the government spent about half
what it has in the last three years, and that at present
only about half of the government's costs are being
met by tax revenue doesn't mean much now. But 20
years hence! The government will either have gone
bankrupt, or we will be burdened with years of
back-breaking tax rates to pay for the folly of the
30's.

Lp in Seattle last week the city was given over two
millions to build arboretums or aquariums or some
other set of projects which aren't particularly needed.
This week Stanford students are receiving $7,19(5.91
in NYA checks. All over the country expensive projects
are being undertaken to the cry of "Hail Recovery!"
A doubtful recovery floating along on borrowed
money.
* * * *
Some argue that it doesn't make any difference how
much money the government spends since it all stays
in the country anyway. They forget that citizens and
banks aren't giving the government this money to
I spend, and that every dime will have to come back in
taxes. And they forget that if the continually mount
ing deficit, which some claim is rising at the rate of
$7,000 a minute, isn't checked, they will not live to
see the day when the red figures are turned to black.

Roosevelt's election the government spent about half
what it has in the last three years, and that at present
only about half of the government's costs are being
met by tax revenue doesn't mean much now. But 20
years hence! The government will either have gone
bankrupt, or we will be burdened with years of
back-breaking tax rates to pay for the folly of the
30's.

Lp in Seattle last week the city was given over two
millions to build arboretums or aquariums or some
other set of projects which aren't particularly needed.
This week Stanford students are receiving $7,19(5.91
in NYA checks. All over the country expensive projects
are being undertaken to the cry of "Hail Recovery!"
A doubtful recovery floating along on borrowed
money.

Some argue that it doesn't make any difference how
much money the government spends since it all stays
in the country anyway. They forget that citizens and
banks aren't giving the government this money to
I spend, and that every dime will have to come back in
taxes. And they forget that if the continually mount
ing deficit, which some claim is rising at the rate of
$7,000 a minute, isn't checked, they will not live to
see the day when the red figures are turned to black.

It is discouraging, but necessary, to realize that our

While we of the college generation ... go blithely
along our four-year way of preparing for future liveli

us unheeding to the activities of a man and his gov

The government debt of Franklin Roosevelt's ad
ministration, piling up into incomprehensible millions,
: must someday be paid off. And we who will have '3G,
, '37, '38, and '39 after our names on the college rolls
will be there at the pay-ofT contributing a huge slice
of our incomes as long as we are able to write our
names on tax returns. Mark Sullivan claims the elec
tion of Roosevelt will be looked upon by historians as
one of the chief reasons for the holding back of re
covery. That commentator might well have added that
the present president will be looked upon as the man
who mortgaged the future of his children and his
children's children.
