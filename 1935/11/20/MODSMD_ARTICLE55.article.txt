The Editor, Sir:
In response to the frosh who com-*
plains of not knowing either John
Fuller or Florence Brown, I would J
like to say it is because of his own |
lack of interest. He apparently had
not read The Daily until after the
election. All candidates were an
nounced in the paper. He could
have found out their qualifications !
then, instead of complaining about j
his lack of knowledge now. Both j
officers had also been in print be- |
fore for taking part in other school
activities.'
It is difficult for 600 people to
know each other in so short a time,
but the fact that John Fuller and ,
Florence Brown were elected shows j
the class of them and their ability.
