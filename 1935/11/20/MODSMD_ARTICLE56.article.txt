i The Editor, Sir:
We address this letter to you in
the spirit of friendly criticism, being
ardent and, in general, satisfied
■ readers.
For reasons which will soon be
: obvious, it is desirable that our
! names be kept secret and we are re-
I lying on you.
Our complaint concerning The
Daily is directed to the relative
j strength of the substance upon
, which the print is applied—the pa
per itself. It may be said that what
is printed is of more importance than
f what it is printed on. But have you
ever tried to use a Daily as a water-
Viag?

Not to decry The Daily but merely
to show you what other publishers
are doing for the Encina water
baggers, we rate papers in the order
of strength as follows:
1. The Hearst papers.
2. The Palo Alto Times.
3. The Salinas Daily Post.
4. The Stanford Daily.
Thus you note The Daily is occu
pying the cellar position in this re
spect. We feel that we must speak
for the East Encina residents; and
we wish that something be done
about it.
