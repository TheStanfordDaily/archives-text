# CAN'T CHA TAKE IT?

The Editor, Sir:
Pity to the unfortunate "Rough
who has gone." We regret that we
annoy him at football games. May
we suggest that a hat be passed
around for funds to construct a fe
male-proof box for him so that his
nerves will not be jangled by the
hysterical meddling young things
with one eye on the bench and the
other on the nearest good-looking
male in the rooting section.
Orchids to the "superior male"
whose virile strength enables him
alone to "lift" the card. (Try Cam
els instead of co-eds. They gift you
a "lift.")
Bring on the smelling salts,
Two Fainting Females
A cactus plant will take root and
begin to grow again after having
been hung up in dry air for six
years.
