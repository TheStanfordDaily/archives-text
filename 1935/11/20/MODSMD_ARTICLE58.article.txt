"BLOSSOM TIME," the romantic
operetta written about the life of
the composer, Frank Schubert, Ls
now playing at the Curran Theater
in San Francisco.
The cast is headed by Paul Keast,
Louise Galen, and Robert Schafer.
Sigmund Romberg took the Schu
bert melodies and wove them into
"Song of Love," "Serenade," and
"Moment Musicale."
' Blossom Time" is the second of a
series of operetta revivals, the next
of which will be "Rose Marie."
MUSIC NOTES: Dick Jurgens' or
chestra at Seattle's Olympic Hotel is
one that's going somewhere ... I
like the fresh tunes they play . . .
About three years too late, I'm ac
tually getting to like Glen Gray,
chiefly 'cause he's not afraid to use
his brass . . . Most beautiful of cur
rent waltzes: "When Love Comes
Your Way" from Cole Porter's score
to "Jubilee."
MORE NOTES to you: George
Gershwin, exhausted after writing
"Porgy and Bess," says his next is
to be something "light and gay and
sexy." . . . "Porgy and Bess" has
two complete sets of principals, one
for afternoon performances, the
other for evening.
BLOODY SHAME: Marjorie Beat
tie, singer with Paul Pendarvis' or
chestra, in need of a blood trans
fusion after an appendicities opera
tion, called on the whole Pendarvis
personnel without finding anyone
with the right type of blood. Then
Griff Williams' aggregation stepped
forward, and Marjorie got her pint
of blood from Buddy Moreno, Griff's
singer.
PET GRIPES: Night editors who
premise to leave 7 inches for a re
view, save only 5. Also persons who
burn because their names aren't
mentioned in the review, due to
night editors' not saving space.
