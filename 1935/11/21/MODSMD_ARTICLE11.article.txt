# Walrus Club Agrees On Value of Peace
## 
### 
Unanimously agreeing that "peace
is desirable," the Walrus Club in
stituted its first panel discussion
this year on "the value and effect of
student strikes and polls against
war" in the Women's Clubhouse
last night.
Introduced by Dr. Eliot Dillcr,
Dr. Guido Marx presented the
conservative viewpoint with, "It
is the function and fate of age to
sound to youth the note of cau
tion."
The panel agreed that the causes
and reasons for war were chiefly in
the economic field, and on that basis
Meivyn Shoor described his plan
for ending war by an intellectual
campaign in colleges over a long
period of time. Others on the panel
believed that student strikes arc im
portant in that they are conducive
to student thought on the question.
"A student strike is an experi
ment in unified action, and is nec
essary as we are too individualistic
on the whole," according to Otis
Brubakcr. "A student can't un
derstand a peace movement until
he has been a part of it," he
added.
Other points were that students
must quit being merely intellectual
and really act on this question.
Helen Grover pointed out that stu
dent strikes to be effective must be
emotional as well as rational.
