NEW YORK, Nov. 20 (/P).â€”Miss
Flora MacDougall's belief that a cast
iron shield she bought for $10 is the
work of Benvenuto Cellini was
strengthened tonight by a letter
from one of the foremost Italian
connoisseurs on metalwork.
He wrote that, from photo
graphs, the shield appeared to he
the work of "an artist whose skill
was certainly not less than that
of Cellini."
Miss MacDougall said that the
letter, written by Senatorc Adolfo
Venturi, from Rome, had strength
ened her belief so that she would
take the shield to Europe for authen
tication as a work of the great Flor
entine master.
