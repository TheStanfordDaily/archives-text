## 
### 
At the Interfraternity Council
meeting held in the Fiji house yes
j terday, it was decided to send John
| Edmundson, secretary of the coun
cil, to the National Interfraternity
Convention in New York Cily, to
! be held November 29 and 30. Ed
mundson will leave by train next
Monday.
It was originally planned that Ed
Littlcfield, president of the Interfra
' ternity Council, should attend the
i convention as Stanford's represen
tative. However, subsequent cir
cumstances forced Littlefield to re
main home, so Edmundson was
chosen in his place.
Each fraternity is taxed $10 to fur
i nish expenses of the council's rep
! resentative to the session.
