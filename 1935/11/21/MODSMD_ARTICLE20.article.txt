# Blaze To Roar In Defiance of Bears; Team Well-Primed
## Thornhill Stresses Aerial Tactics in Strenuous Drill Sessions 
### Herb Diamond 
Only a matter of two more clays
now before Stanford's gridiron
guns will boom out against those
Berkeley Bears. And Tiny Thorn
hill is priming the local artillery
well.
Last night he sent the Big Red
Machine through still another ae
rial drill, concentrating on of
fensive and defensive tactics alike.
Tiie assurance that impenetrable
forward walls will clash on the
stadium turf Saturday afternoon
has necessitated emphasis on a
passing attack. And, according to
all reports. Stub Allison seems to
join Tiny in opining that the Big
Game will probably be won via
the air. For the Bears have been
paying more than a little atten
tion to aerial plays.
Early yesterday morning Thorn
hill repeated the tentative starting
line-up for Saturday's festivities, but
in doing so revealed only one new
point—that Bones Hamilton will
definitely join the regulars. Bobby
Grayson will be at fullback; Bill
Faulman, quarterback; Hamilton,
right half; Jimmy Coffis, left half;
Monk Moscrip and Keith Topping
are the two ends; Horse Reynolds
and Dale Beedle are to hold down
the tackle positions; Woody Adams
and Larry Rouble will be the guards;
and Wes Muller will get the call at
center.
A severe cold sent Muller to the
hospital last Tuesday, but Dr.
Fritz Roth, team physician, an
nounced that Wes will be in shape
for tonight's session under the
flood lights. With Tex Luckett and
Neils Larscn back in uniform the
big center was the only gridder
absent from last night's drill.
Thus the early season hope that
there would be no cripples on the
Big Red Toboggan during Big
Game week will probably be re
alized tonight when Muller re
-1 joins his team-mates today.
The condition of Bones Hamilton's
| bashed nose is improving but he is
; set to sport his new protective hel
! met Saturday. This head-gear is far
i less cumbersome than the over-
I sized nose guard Bones was under
| in previous practice sessions.
On hand for last night's work
out was a large audience that in
cluded Mr. L. S. Moscrip, father
of Monk Moscrip, who arrived in
1 l'alo Alto Tuesday evening after
having motored from his home in
Adcna, Ohio. The elder Moscrip
; expressed confidence in the abil
ity of Stanford.
While the Indian grid warriors
! were hard at work Rally Committee
] officials were cautioning students to
remember four regulations that will
be enforced at the Big Game. Stu
i dent body cards must be shown,
rooters' tickets to that section only
1 will be honored, both men and worn
| en must wear white shirts, and men
i must wear rooters' caps, they
! warned.

hospital last Tuesday, but Dr.
Fritz Roth, team physician, an
nounced that Wes will be in shape
for tonight's session under the
flood lights. With Tex Luckett and
Neils Larscn back in uniform the
big center was the only gridder
absent from last night's drill.
Thus the early season hope that
there would be no cripples on the
Big Red Toboggan during Big
Game week will probably be re
alized tonight when Muller re
-1 joins his team-mates today.
The condition of Bones Hamilton's
| bashed nose is improving but he is
; set to sport his new protective hel
! met Saturday. This head-gear is far
i less cumbersome than the over-
I sized nose guard Bones was under
| in previous practice sessions.
On hand for last night's work
out was a large audience that in
cluded Mr. L. S. Moscrip, father
of Monk Moscrip, who arrived in
1 l'alo Alto Tuesday evening after
having motored from his home in
Adcna, Ohio. The elder Moscrip
; expressed confidence in the abil
ity of Stanford.
While the Indian grid warriors
! were hard at work Rally Committee
] officials were cautioning students to
remember four regulations that will
be enforced at the Big Game. Stu
i dent body cards must be shown,
rooters' tickets to that section only
1 will be honored, both men and worn
| en must wear white shirts, and men
i must wear rooters' caps, they
! warned.
Only a matter of two more clays
now before Stanford's gridiron
guns will boom out against those
Berkeley Bears. And Tiny Thorn
hill is priming the local artillery
well.
Last night he sent the Big Red
Machine through still another ae
rial drill, concentrating on of
fensive and defensive tactics alike.
Tiie assurance that impenetrable
forward walls will clash on the
stadium turf Saturday afternoon
has necessitated emphasis on a
passing attack. And, according to
all reports. Stub Allison seems to
join Tiny in opining that the Big
Game will probably be won via
the air. For the Bears have been
paying more than a little atten
tion to aerial plays.
Early yesterday morning Thorn
hill repeated the tentative starting
line-up for Saturday's festivities, but
in doing so revealed only one new
point—that Bones Hamilton will
definitely join the regulars. Bobby
Grayson will be at fullback; Bill
Faulman, quarterback; Hamilton,
right half; Jimmy Coffis, left half;
Monk Moscrip and Keith Topping
are the two ends; Horse Reynolds
and Dale Beedle are to hold down
the tackle positions; Woody Adams
and Larry Rouble will be the guards;
and Wes Muller will get the call at
center.
A severe cold sent Muller to the
hospital last Tuesday, but Dr.
Fritz Roth, team physician, an
nounced that Wes will be in shape
for tonight's session under the
flood lights. With Tex Luckett and
