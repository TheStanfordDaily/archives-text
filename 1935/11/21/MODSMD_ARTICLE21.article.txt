"Rally Committee is hard at work learning these songs, and 1
guess if we tan do it the students can." With this statement Phil
Coghlan, Rally Committee chairman, urged that everyone learn the
Hymn and "Hail, Alma Mater, Hail" by Saturday.
THE HYMN
Where the rolling foothills rise
Up toward mountains higher,
Where at eve the Coast Range lies,
In the sunset fire,
Flushing deep and paling,
Here we raise our voices, hailing
Tlice, our Alma Mater.
(Refrain)
From the foothills to the bay
It shall ring.
As we sing,
It shall ring and float away.
Hail, Stanford, Hail!
Hail, Stanford, Hail!
HAIL ALMA MATER
Hail! Hail! Hail! Alma Mater, Hail!
Stanford, Hail!
Thy fame shall e'er prevail,
Thy sons thy plory shall acclaim.
And ever honor thy fair name,
So. Hail! Hail! Hail!
Alma Mater, Hail!
Hail! Hail! Hail! Alma Mater, Hail!
Stanford, Hail!
Thy fame shall e'er prevail.
With hearts that ever true shall be,
We pledge our love anew to thee.
So. Hail! Hail! Hail!
Alma Mater, Hail!
