# Cal Awakes To Find Big 'C' Cardinal
## 
### 
Startled California students
awoke yesterday morning to
find their famous Big C colored
Cardinal. Left unguarded dur
ing the night, it had been coat
ed with five gallons of red
paint.
The job is credited to Stan
ford freshmen, determined
to disprove the recent accusa
tion made by "Our Hasher"
that the Class of '39 lacks tra
ditional Stanford spirit. About
4 o'clock in the morning they
made the trip to Berkeley and
decorated the C.
In the event of a Cal raid on
the bonfire before it is burned
tonight the power-house whis
tle will blow three times, warn
ing students to go to the aid of
the 20 guards that will be sta
tioned there from G o'clock un
til the rally ends.
