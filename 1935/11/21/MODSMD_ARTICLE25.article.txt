### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 20 (/I 5 ). â€”
Connivance between Thomas J.
Mooney's prosecutor and the fore
man of the jury which convicted
him was charged by Edwin V. Mc-
Kenzie, former associate counsel for
the internationally known convict,
here today.
The charge led to a bitter clash
at Mooney's habeas corpus hearing
during which McKenzie, a witness,
accused California Supreme Court
Referee A E. Shaw with minimizing
the testimony.
