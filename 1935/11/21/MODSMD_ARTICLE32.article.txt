# Sophomore Possibilities

### 


Glenn Hamilton, half-back, has had a tough time trying to get into a
line-up that boasts of Grayson, Hamilton, and Vigna, but is ready to step
in any time when 'fhornhill needs liiin. Next to Paulman, Hamilton is
the best kicker on the team. Grant Stone is faced with the same trouble,
as the games this year have been too light for many substitutions.
Stone is rated quite a pass catcher.
