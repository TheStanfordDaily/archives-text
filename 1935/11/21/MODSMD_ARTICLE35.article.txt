# Search Begins For Lost Flier
## Frank Kurtz Missing In Hop from Los Angeles 
### 
CHEYENNE, Wyo., Nov. 20 (/P).â€”
Ey plane, automobile, and from
horseback, keen-eyed Wyoming men
scanned the canyon and cliffsides
of the mountain country west of
here today in search of Frank Kurtz,
nationally known 21-year-old avia
tor, missing more than 24 hours.
No word has been received
from the young Los Angeles flier
since his ship, "The Yankee Boy,"
with fuel enough for only four
hours of Hying in its tanks, hopped
westward from the Cheyenne
airport at 3:."10 p.m. yesterday.
Kurtz, who has made several
transcontinental and border-to-bor
dei flights in quest of records, told
airport attendants he was bound for
Los Angeles by way of Salt Lake
City.
HLs route would take him over
the threatening stretches of th.2
Laramie Mountains and the Pole
Mountain area. His light biplang
fought a headwind of 50 to GO miles
per hour velocity.
Searching parties, the memory
of two recent air disasters which
claimed 10 lives fresh in their
minds, took up the hunt from
Cheyenne and several other points
west of here. Pilot Fred Wahl
and a companion, Pal Mileski, took
ofT from Rawlins and planned to
fly low over the mountains, hop
ing to sight some trace of Kurtz,
until darkness fell.
Highway patrolmen from Chey
enne and sheriff's officers from here
and other towns scattered to the
westward pursued the search in au
tomobiles.
II not trace of the missing youth
is lound, the search will be resumed
at daybreak tomorrow with a
United Air Lines plane joining in
the hunt.
