# Sino-Japanese Meet Northern China Crisis
## Agreement Sought For Five Provinces In Autonomy Move Chinese Concentration At Great Wall Rumor Declared False 
### 
SHANGHAI, Nov. 20 (A 1 ).â€” I The
meeting of Chinese Generalissimo
Chiang Kai-Shek and Japanese
Ambassador Akira Ariyoshi at
Nanking today provoked annoyed
impatience among the Japanese
military, reliable quarters stated.
The military, it was said, con
sidered the meeting a concilia
tory gesture by Japan's diplomatic
leaders, in the crisis over the North
China autonomy movement.
Japanese and Chinese official
quarters here, however, said recon
ciliation between the Nanking and
the North China authorities might
result from delay in inaugurating an
autonomous administration in the
five northern provinces.
These sources believed the meet
ing of Ariyoshi and Chiang Kai
shek, military leaders of the national
government at Nanking, together
with continuance of talks between
Chiang and General Sung Cheh-
Yuan, a leader in the North China
autonomy program, would provide
a common basis of agreement.
A Japanese military spokesman
here said Japanese troops were
massing near the Great Wall of
China only to balance a reported
concentration of Nanking soldiers
just south of the five northern
provinces. The account of a Chi
nese concentration was denied by
Nanking officials.
Informed quarters in Shanghai
expressed the belief that delay in
setting up an autonomous govern
ment in North China would elim
inate possibility of Chiang's com
ing under verbal fire from opponents
in the Nationalist Party Congress.
Its sessions at Nanking will end
Friday or Saturday.
