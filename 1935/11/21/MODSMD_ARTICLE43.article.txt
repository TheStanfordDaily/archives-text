The 1935 intramural football
championship assumed an all-fra
ternity color yesterday as Zete and
Fiji gained the finals by defeating
the Business Gratis and Chi P.si.
The final game will be played next
week.
The Zete game was a very close
affair throughout, with little yard
age and no scores gained by either
team. Each squad seemed readily
ajjje to cope with the other's of
fense; Howell Turner's passes
were seldom completed, and Ernie
Arbuckle's touted running ability
was effectively checked.
In the overtime period Turner
passed to Maury Cinn for a 40-yard
gain that the Business School was
unable to make up, and the victory
went to the Rowmen by a 1 to 0
tenre.
Zete: W. Spencer, Turner, Dunn,
Kingsbury, Bowen, Ditz, D. Spen
cer, Underwood, Ginn, Cass.
Business School: Arbuckle, Nay
lon, Frates, Mallatratt, Knecht,
Benson, Hammond.
After an even first half the Fijis
went into' high gear in the second
period, with Bill Newsom cracking
the tackles and passing for consist
ent gains. After an 80-yard drive
L;.ury Bayer reached the score col
umn with a perfect placement, New
som holding. The touchdown came
shortly afterward on a pass, New
som to Lee Irelan.
Fiji: Newsom, Irelan, Douglas,
Davis, Bayer, Downey, Coulter, Rig
gins. Chi Psi: Littlefield, Merritt,
D. Myers, G. Myers, Atkinson, Ben
del, Clark.
