SO BOBBY
HAS A COMPLEX
Here is one of the worst ones
we've heard yet. It's a neatly veiled
! piece that appeared in the Oakland
j Tribune Tuesday evening by Sports
l Editor Phil Ray.
Two-thirds of a column he de-
I votes to building up the stand that
I Bob Grayson never has played well
1 in Big Games.
Then he comes through with
this statement. "Some say that
Bobby was merely the victim of
; bad luck in Big Games and that
i In'll go to town Saturday. Others
| say that the Bears "hexed" him
in the Bear-Tribe Freshman game
four years ago when Larry Lufz
and a few others nailed him so
hard and so often when he played
! safety that he enters the game
1 with a complex."
Now we may be wrong, but it's
| hard to imagine that "complex"
j reference as anything more than an
outright statement that Bobby is
just a trifle "yellow." And those are
I fighting words around this Farm.
First of all it's quite obvious
that Grayson's poor showings in
j Big Games (he has an average of
about 4 yards per play for his ,
two Cal meetings) have been due ;
I entirely to injuries. And when a
fellow has a bashed bone or tear- j
1 ing nerve pain, he can't be blamed |
I for not racing all over the field for j
j touchdowns.
Bobby is the last fellow in the !
I world to quit—injured or not. At ,
j Washington they carried him off the j
« field, his ankle racked with almost I
unbearable pain. And if you've
I never sat. beside him, watched the
I beads of perspiration drop off his
! brow, see his face twist with the
pain of the thing, then you might
not understand how that man suf
fered for football.
Doctor Fritz Roth took off his
| shoe, worked over the injured
j ankle nerve, eased the pain some- j
what, and Bob went back to stave ;
off Washington's drives and to an
nihilate the meagre Indian 3-
point advantage. With an ankle
that was tender to every move, i
And they say this man might
have a touch of fear of Cal's Lar
ry Lutz and following.
lIE DIDN'T QUIT
AT U.S.C.
At U.S.C. a couple of weeks ago
' they knocked him completely loco
and he came off the grid "out on
his feet." He stayed out for a while
and then finally resumed full senses
' again. And in five minutes after he
was all himself back into the ball
game he went to drive and smash
and literally tear himself down into
kicking territory. And this is the
man at whom they throw a hint of
complex.
As far as being especially leery
of California because of the sup
posed beating he took in the little j
big game four years ago, that's !
foolish.
Grayson, throughout his whole j
Stanford football career, has never j
known fear, or at least never shown
it outwardly. That he hasn't done |
1 well in Big Games indicates nothing |
| more than the fact that bad luck j
' caught him in those certain games. J
When a man shows no hesitancy !
about playing, with injuries against :
I every opponent for three years, it
i stands to reason that he'd do the
same against Cal—if physically able. 1
For two Big Games now he's '
been so battered by half time that
play was physically impossible.
But Saturday he starts hi good

luck favors him with an injury
free game.
But if it doesn't and he goes out
of the game, his last game for Stan
ford. without showing you, Mr. Ray,
that there's not a hint of complex in
him, then go down on the bench be
side him and watch him suffer. See
if he's really afraid. —Frost
