# Quarterback and Center

"Doc' Luckett, quarterback on the Stanford team, broke into the line
up during the Washington game and since has done some fancy signal
calling against the i rojans and Montana. Luckett is only a sophomore.
All Brantlin, second-string center, turned in a bang-up game against the
Grizzlies last Saturday and will probably see action in the Big Game.
