# Indians to Clash Twice With U.C. in Water Polo
## 
### 
Two naval battles, both of which
promise to be as rough and tough
as any conflicts that ever came un
der the heading of aquatic sport,
will get under way Saturday morn
ing when Stanford and California
frosh and varsity water poloists
clash.
The yearling outfits will begin
festivities promptly at 10 o'clock,
while the first-stringers are
scheduled to paddle it out imme
diately after the Papoose-Cub
tussle.
Despite the fact that a mighty
Uclan septet downed both the Ber
keleyites and the Indians in succes
sion last week-end and thus took the
Pacific Coast Conference title for
tho first time, water polo's Big
Game still looms as the all-important
tilt as far as the two northern ag
gregations are concerned.
The Bears, spurred by Coach A1
Dowden's publicized prediction
that they would "beat hell out of
those redshirts any time," will in
vade the Indian stronghold highly
determined to score a triumph.
Under the guiding hand of Nort

Thornton, however, the Cardinals
have prepared a sizzling reception
for the Californians.
An added incentive for Thornton's
charges is the fact that Stanford has
not been overpowered in her home
pool by a California team during all
of the 23 years of Indian-Bear aqua
tic competition. But the Berkeley
ites will probably enter the Farm
j tank as favorites this Saturday solely
. because of the 8-2 drubbing they
handed the Cardinals more than a
month ago.
