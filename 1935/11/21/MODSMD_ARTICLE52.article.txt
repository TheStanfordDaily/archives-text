## 
### 
With most of the first string laid
up with injuries or colds, the Stan
ford varsity soccer team defeated
San Jose State yesterday on the
Indian field, 2 to 1. Only six of the
eleven men starting the game
played throughout, but the Indian
reserves conquered the Spartans by
the same score as the Bears did two
y/eeks ago.
All three goals were made in
the first half. Karl Schaupp
stored first, and the next point
was rung up by the Spartans. Ed
Nightingale, who has been play
ing at right inside in place of the
injured Mike Gomez, won the
game for Stanford with a perfect
long shot from the corner. *
The second half was a tough de
fensive struggle, in which the In
dians had San Jose well backed up
but missed numerous shots. Bob

| Hull, regular center half, had his
second ankle sprainea, and is now
on crutches. Hall, an "old war
hcrse" like Grayson, has been
banged up in nearly every game,
and may play against the Bears
Saturday, though he certainly won't
start.
Showing improved passing and
defense, but poor shooting, the
i Indian Irosh soccermeti were held
to a 1-1 tie yesterday liy an un
defeated Half Moon Bay
School eleven. Harry Lowe, cen
ter forward, scored the yearlings'
