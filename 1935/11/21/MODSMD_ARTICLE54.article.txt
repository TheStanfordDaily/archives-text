## Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily Goal Posts Cost $57,975 a Pair Rooting Section Changes: Women Enter, Some Separate, Chatter Banned at Times 
### 
This year's Big Game rooting section is to
have three features unfamiliar to Stanford
students: 177 students will attend the game
without being in the regular rooting section,
the women will he placed at the top of the ;
section, and an attempt will he made to keep ,
Hit' section quiet at certain times.
For students who yesterday bought Sec
tion A tickets, any plans to "crash" the main j
seetion will he of no avail. The rallymen
and an almost equal number of special B.A.C. j
police will do their utmost to keep them out. i
Obviously, to admit them into the main
section would be unfair to students with le
gitimate rooters' tickets and to the adjacent
alumni. B.A.C. feels it has done its part for 1
students; it now expects those students who !
were given a "break" to do their part by re- ;
maining in their designated scats. Their ex- j
peetation will be backed by force if Stanford
men temporarily forget their genllemanliness.
Women students have at last been given the
right to be a regular part of the rooting sec
lion. They will sit at the top—the best seats
lo many's way of thinking. Men and women
will not be able to date and sit side by side as ;
was possible by getting edge seals when the j
women's section flanked the men's.
Student body cards will, as usual, be a
requisite for admittance lo the section. Any
one illegally holding rooters' tickets or unable i

/ to show an A.S.S.U. card will be subject to
I immediate eviction from the section. White
shirts and rooters' hats are requisite for the
men; white for the women will also be en
forced.
The yell-leaders will doubtless request that
there be no "chatter" from the moment the
huddle stalls until the ball is snapped. Veil
ing as the huddle breaks is definitely a handi
cap to the team; members have often ex
pressed their irritation with the section for
yelling at such limes. They are in no mood
for "tight talk" when il prevents them from
hearing their "hikes" and accomplishing the
ends which the "light talk" itself desires.
At Big Games, the Stadium can hardly be
expected to be tomb-like in its silence, but the
students can help the team materially by
maintaining quiet when the team is in a
huddle and when it is putting the ball into
play.
Game-going students Saturday, then, have
in addition to the ever-present details of
white shirt, ticket, and cap- two more items
to watch and one less. Students in the sepa
rate section will have the privilege of seeing
that they stay there; Houghs in the main sec
tion will he able to concentrate on keeping
quiet at the right times in order lo give the
team a "break." Hut the latter won't be able
lo watch the women—they'll be behind the
section.

students: 177 students will attend the game
without being in the regular rooting section,
the women will he placed at the top of the ;
section, and an attempt will he made to keep ,
Hit' section quiet at certain times.
For students who yesterday bought Sec
tion A tickets, any plans to "crash" the main j
seetion will he of no avail. The rallymen
and an almost equal number of special B.A.C. j
police will do their utmost to keep them out. i
Obviously, to admit them into the main
section would be unfair to students with le
gitimate rooters' tickets and to the adjacent
alumni. B.A.C. feels it has done its part for 1
students; it now expects those students who !
were given a "break" to do their part by re- ;
maining in their designated scats. Their ex- j
peetation will be backed by force if Stanford
men temporarily forget their genllemanliness.
Women students have at last been given the
right to be a regular part of the rooting sec
lion. They will sit at the top—the best seats
lo many's way of thinking. Men and women
will not be able to date and sit side by side as ;
was possible by getting edge seals when the j
women's section flanked the men's.
Student body cards will, as usual, be a
requisite for admittance lo the section. Any
one illegally holding rooters' tickets or unable i

/ to show an A.S.S.U. card will be subject to
I immediate eviction from the section. White
shirts and rooters' hats are requisite for the
men; white for the women will also be en
forced.
The yell-leaders will doubtless request that
there be no "chatter" from the moment the
huddle stalls until the ball is snapped. Veil
ing as the huddle breaks is definitely a handi
cap to the team; members have often ex
pressed their irritation with the section for
yelling at such limes. They are in no mood
for "tight talk" when il prevents them from
hearing their "hikes" and accomplishing the
ends which the "light talk" itself desires.
At Big Games, the Stadium can hardly be
expected to be tomb-like in its silence, but the
students can help the team materially by
maintaining quiet when the team is in a
huddle and when it is putting the ball into
play.
Game-going students Saturday, then, have
in addition to the ever-present details of
white shirt, ticket, and cap- two more items
to watch and one less. Students in the sepa
rate section will have the privilege of seeing
that they stay there; Houghs in the main sec
tion will he able to concentrate on keeping
quiet at the right times in order lo give the
team a "break." Hut the latter won't be able
lo watch the women—they'll be behind the
section.
