# Things Will Have Come To a Pretty Pass Then
## 
### 
Willi every indication that there would be
more men to work on the bonfire than would
be needed, no trouble was expected today by
the bonfire committee in the construction of
Hie big pyre.
Although the bonfire will not be as big us
some, it w ill be larger than last year's, the first
of the new series. Two years ago, lightening
of finances partially prompted the I>x Com
mittee to end officially the bosh-built pyres
which were constructed over a week period.
That year, only a small blaze built by Se
quoia men, those jealous guardians of what
is left of the Hough, kept the tradition alive.

Bonlire this year will not be unsung; there
will he plenty of people on hand. No exhorta
tions to watch the blaze or attend the preced
ing rally are needed. Tonight there will prob
ably be room—for a change—for all students
at the rally, since a new scheme will keep
townspeople out of the Pavilion until students
arrive. Until the parade reaches the doors,
they will be locked tight.
When the time comes when there is a
necessity for long orations on the advisability
of going to the Big (lame rally and bonlire,
Stanford had better give up the ghost.
