Up before the forces of Law and Order recently
was an Encina freshman, found by the militia in the
vicinity of Lagunita with a fistful of eggs. He came
up to Men's Council, which was looking for the mis
creant who had egg-nogged Encina Hall and had
placed an egg in the half shell in the chair of the
chairman of a campus debate that same evening. The
chairman of the debate happened to be likewise chair
man of Men's Council, and inclined to feel strongly
on the point.
All these accusations the freshman stoutly denied,
and explained the cause celcbre was something en
tirely different. "I threw eggs all over a gal who was
sitting in her car in front of Lagunita."
"And why did you do that?" asked the councilman
sternly.
"Because she stood me up on a date," answered the
frosh.

This changed the complexion of the affair. The
august body lectured the freshman sternly on the sub
ject, and then the chairman suggested he send a chcck
to the girl to cover expenses.
"I've already done that," said the butter man.
Endeavoring to impress a lady in his biology class
with whom he had a blind date, a country gentleman
showed up at his 8 o'clock some days ago dressed in
a tux.
It is said that the lady in his biology class was
impressed.
And I am.
Mr. Gros, perfumer by appointment to the fiscal
accounts, was conducting a freshman woman on a
walking tour past the place where they are starting
construction of the scaffolding, for trucks to dump
gravel, concrete garbage, and Our Hasher for the New
Theater.
Said .she: "But surely, they aren't going to build
that beautiful new building out of those dirty old
boards."
And i thouuht it was the Bin Claim- Bonl'iro.
