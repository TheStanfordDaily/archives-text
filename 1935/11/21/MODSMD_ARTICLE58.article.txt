## THE 						BIG BUSINESS 
### 
If you could turn back the clock 40 years or so,
you'd find Stanford and California playing one of their
first Big Games. You'd find Southern Pacific giving a
special round-trip rate from Paly to the city. You'd
see that gate charges at a tiny San Francisco ball park
were about 50 cents per, and you'd look at stands filled
with students, hardly a non-collegian oldster in sight.

Admittedly football has grown out of this innocent
infancy, and has developed into a sport for the outside
public and into a business for the nation's universities.
A traditional defense for football's commercializa
tion is that it is only one of a number of things that
a changing world has made elaborate, expensive, and
organized.
But in the case of businesses other than football,
there was a normal demand for more prompt, perfect,
and efficient service. Expanding life required it, and
the business man's obvious duty was to provide the
set-up capable of giving such service.
The development of transportation and telephony,
for instance, is not comparable to the development of
football. For in football's case the chicken of demand
did not precede the egg of supply. It was the egg that
came first, a golden egg incubated by the universities
themselves, by newspapers looking for new circulation
builders.
* * jJ:
An expanding continent needed railroads and tele
phones, but it was not an expanding public interest
that required bigger and better football. That interest
was admittedly manufactured. Many believe that even
today, when football is the national pastime, it is a
figurative colossus kept going largely by artificial
means.
Artificially excited or not, however, public demand
for football is in a practical sense justification for
collegiate supply. The elaborate administrative ma
chine of the Big Game is not vulnerable to Criticism
on the grounds of its mere existence.
* * * *
But those who like sport for sport's sake, who
believe that participant interest and the interest of
collegians is more important than the interest of <1
buffaloed public, decry modern football for different
reasons. They would like to see the chicken, in this
case collegiate student bodies, lay the egg of football
demand and incubate it under their own wings. And
they would prefer it to be not a golden egg so delicate
and valuable that it needs the protection of an elab
orate incubator, with financial nurses and doctors
standing in attendance.
They would prefer it to be the normal unprepos
sessing egg that football was in "them days," when
it was laid by a bona fide student hen.

But those who like sport for sport's sake, who
believe that participant interest and the interest of
collegians is more important than the interest of <1
buffaloed public, decry modern football for different
reasons. They would like to see the chicken, in this
case collegiate student bodies, lay the egg of football
demand and incubate it under their own wings. And
they would prefer it to be not a golden egg so delicate
and valuable that it needs the protection of an elab
orate incubator, with financial nurses and doctors
standing in attendance.
They would prefer it to be the normal unprepos
sessing egg that football was in "them days," when
it was laid by a bona fide student hen.

If you could turn back the clock 40 years or so,
you'd find Stanford and California playing one of their
first Big Games. You'd find Southern Pacific giving a
special round-trip rate from Paly to the city. You'd
see that gate charges at a tiny San Francisco ball park
were about 50 cents per, and you'd look at stands filled
with students, hardly a non-collegian oldster in sight.

Admittedly football has grown out of this innocent
infancy, and has developed into a sport for the outside
public and into a business for the nation's universities.
A traditional defense for football's commercializa
tion is that it is only one of a number of things that
a changing world has made elaborate, expensive, and
organized.
But in the case of businesses other than football,
there was a normal demand for more prompt, perfect,
and efficient service. Expanding life required it, and
the business man's obvious duty was to provide the
set-up capable of giving such service.
The development of transportation and telephony,
for instance, is not comparable to the development of
football. For in football's case the chicken of demand
did not precede the egg of supply. It was the egg that
came first, a golden egg incubated by the universities
themselves, by newspapers looking for new circulation
builders.

An expanding continent needed railroads and tele
phones, but it was not an expanding public interest
that required bigger and better football. That interest
was admittedly manufactured. Many believe that even
today, when football is the national pastime, it is a
figurative colossus kept going largely by artificial
means.
Artificially excited or not, however, public demand
for football is in a practical sense justification for
collegiate supply. The elaborate administrative ma
chine of the Big Game is not vulnerable to Criticism
on the grounds of its mere existence.
