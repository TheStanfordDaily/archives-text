## NEW RECORDS 
### 
Once again the top spot of the
week in the record whirl goes to an
English band. This time it's Caroll
i Gibbons' orchestra from the swank
j Savoy Hotel in London playing a
continental fox-trot, "Whisper
Sweet." Don't ask me how they do
it, but the best British bands seem to
j keep away from the over-elabora
| tion of a Whiteman, the sickly
I mugginess of a Lombardo, and the
I blatant blaring of an Armstrong.
This recording by the Savoy Hotel
Opheans, imported by Columbia,
has all the simple melodic swing of
! the old Ray Noble, before that jazz
master went American and colle
! giate.
On the other side you'll find an
other imported pressing, this time a
piquant edition of "Red Sails in
the Sunset" from the "Province
town Follies" recorded by Manto
-1 vani and his Tipica Orchestra. It's
pood, too!
j You'll fir. d these on Columbia rec
j ord 3097-D.
In a three-way tie for second hon
i onrs is a trio of records in the
American swing style. This new
"musician's" music gave a first-
Ireath gasp in the lurid moanings
of Louis Prima's gang from New
j Orleans and went popular under the
! baton of Benny Goodman. For a
( good post-graduate course in
I swingology take a stop-look-and-
I listen to Red McKenzie's lilting de
| scription of "Monday in Manhat
| tan" on Decca disk 587. On the
other side you'll find a modified
swing version of "Every Now and
Then."
The second swing record is under
the baton of Teddy Wilson and fea
tures "Twenty-four Hours a Day"
from "Sweet Surrender" and "Yan
kee Doodle Never Went to Town."
The first of these is one of the best
of the season's tunes and is done up
in holiday trimmings on this press
ing. Both are good and hot, with
vocal choruses by Billie Holiday.
Take a look at Brunswick record
7550. P.S.: On second thought, may
be this ought to take top spot of
the week. At least for swing fans,
it's an absolute "must." â€”Squires
