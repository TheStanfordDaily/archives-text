The Editor, Sir:
This year we have witnessed many
abuses of Rally Committee author- i
j ity. Climaxing them was the fla- j
grant disregard of civil and proper
ty rights, evidenced by plastering !
' of "Beat the Bears" stickers upon 1
1 campus automobiles.
I did my best to "Wax Wash- j
ington," even putting a sticker on 1
my windshield. But when some !
: half-witted, rah-rah rally commit- |
teeman slaps an 8-by-12 sticker on !
my newly washed windshield, then !
I rebel!
Does the committee know of the j
j slate law which prohibits stickers I
, which impair the vision of the driv- j
erHas it heard of the federal bill j
of rights which guarantee every in
dividual the use of his life, liberty,
and property as he sees fit? This
dastardly action by Coghlan's
; "stooges" definitely interferes with
ihe pleasure I derive from the use of
my auto.
The Turning Worm j
P.S.: The freshmen women are
! terrific.
