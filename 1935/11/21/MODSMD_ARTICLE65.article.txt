# GETS POETIC OVER BOOES

### 
The Editor, Sir:
The following outburst of poetry
was, I feel safe in saying, caused as
a direct result of the imprisonment
of one of my friends for showing
that he was bored by the movie
showing at one of the local theaters.
1 pray that I shall always hear
A grunt, a boo, a hiss, a cheer,
When lousy shows I cannot bear.
I'm one of those who likes to jeer.
