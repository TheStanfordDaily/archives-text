# DIANA'S DIARY

### THE CO-ED SHOPPER 
Dear Diary: Leave the Big Game I
to the sports pages, I've got to talk
about the Big Date. I'm going to
celebrate in turquoise blue—no re
lation to U.C. blue. After dithering
for days among MARY ELIZA
BETH'S selection of formals, I pick
ed this costume. Without the
jacket, it's a simple but smart
formal with clever shirrings. With
the tailored rhinestone-studded
jacket, it's my idea of swank. Ev
eryone is moaning over having to
wear last summer's white sweaters
in the rooting section, but at least
you can wear a new hat. I got mine i
from the group of football felts at
MARY ELIZABETH'S. 119 Univer
sity. Accessories to the crime are i
from MARIAN SEIMAS. 534 Ra
ir.ona, where she has the latest in
evening slips, lingeries, and bras—
nol to mention adorable formal
bags. I've made sure my corsage I

will be perfect by telling Ted noth
ing but the FLOWER SHOP, 175
University, will do. They also have
Stanford and Cal corsages for the
game. A.s for the hair, LYDIA will
take care of that. I phoned her,
P.A. 22692, for an appointment early
Saturday for a formal coiffeur. I've
tried out Ballarde, Alexandra de
Markoff's new perfume, and it's the
tv p. The UNIVERSITY PHAR
MACY, 134 University, has the four
odors in purse size satin sacks.
When the family and friends come
to town for the game or for a visit,
there's no restaurant with the quiet,
sophisticated atmosphere of JER
OLD'S, 229 Hamilton. I'm delighted
to be able to recommend it. The first
of the term papers for this quarter
has been sent to the ASSOCIATED
STENOGRAPHERS, 443 Bryant.
They have rates as low as ten cents
i page and do work that practically
guarantees an "A".
