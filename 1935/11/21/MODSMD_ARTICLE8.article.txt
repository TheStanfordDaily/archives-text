# CALL FOR NYA CARDS
## 
### 
This afternoon at 5 o'clock is the
last chance for students to claim
their NYA release cards, warned
Mrs. Irene Coverley, student em
ployment director, yesterday. Stu
dents who do not call for their
cards by that time will lose their
jobs, find the vacated jobs will go
to those on the waiting list.
