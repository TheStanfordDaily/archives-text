# What Will It Take To Keep the Axe?

AN ALL-AMERICAN? That's what the papers say about Larry
Lutz, veteran California tackle. He runs up against a tougher
line in tomorrow's Big Game than any he has faced yet this year
and his showing will indicate the justice of the claims.


DIZZY DEAN OF THE GRIDIRON is descriptive of Floyd
Blower, considered the deadliest passer in Pacific Coast
football. Stanford remembers something of a dead-eye
from Alabama in last year's New Year's Day game, and
Indian fans will find out tomorrow whether Tiny Thorn
hill's Cardinal defenders have worked out an adeguate
defense for this type of game. Blower's passing and open
field running have been largely responsible for
the Bears' nine-game victory streak this year.


A. VERSATILE END is Stanford's Monk Moscrip. He kicked the field goal (pictured above) that defeated U.S.C., 3 to 0, in the
last minute two weeks ago. Moscrip, shown above and at rig ht, has the other qualifications of an all-American end he is a
defensive powerhouse, glue-fingered pass-snatcher, and is note d for the masterful way he covers punts. Moscrip field goals in
the past two years have won four games; odds are that Monk w ill attempt a couple of place kicks during tomorrow's contest.


CALIFORNIA'S BACKFIELD lined
up this way at the start of the sea
son. All four of these aces will
see action as the Bears make their
most serious bid for a Conference
championship and Rose Bowl bid
in seven years in Stanford Stadium
tomorrow. Left to right, they are
A1 (Baggy) Thorell, fullback; Bill
Archer and Floyd Blower, half
backs; and Chuck Cotton, quarter
back. Thorell is a brilliant line
plunger of the hard-driving vari
ety and will be remembered from
last year's Big Game. Archer, a
southpaw, and Blower, a right
hander, are two of the Coast's most
accurate passers; both of these
halfbacks are dangerous open field
runners. Cotton has a reputation
as a powerful blocker. This is
just one of the many backfield
combinations Stub Allison
has at his disposal.



THE AXE, mounted as a trophy, for two years has gone to the winner of
the Big Game. In 1933 Stanford won it with a 70-yard "prayer" pass, Alustiza
to Norgard. Last year Bones Hamilton crashed right end in the last guarter
for the winning points. What will it take tomorrow? Will it be Moscrip's
toe, or will it be Bobby Grayson's off-tackle slashes? Can he pierce the Bear
defense that has allowed its goal line to be crossed only once this year,
and that on a blocked kick? The California clean slate makes the Bears
slight pre-game favorites, according to Bay Region sports writers.


CAN BONES STAND IT? Will Bobby Grayson be all by himself as he is against the horde of
Washington Huskies shown at the top? Or will the hard-blocking Hamilton be pulling out ahead,
cracking down the ends and secondary, and paving the goalward march for the Boomer as he did
for three seasons until an injury shelved him ear ly this year? These are guestions that bother
Tiny Thornhill on the eve of the Big Game as he wonders about the completeness of Bones'
recovery. Grayson and Hamilton are together again on the starting line-up.

AN ALL-AMERICAN? That's what the papers say about Larry
Lutz, veteran California tackle. He runs up against a tougher
line in tomorrow's Big Game than any he has faced yet this year
and his showing will indicate the justice of the claims.


DIZZY DEAN OF THE GRIDIRON is descriptive of Floyd
Blower, considered the deadliest passer in Pacific Coast
football. Stanford remembers something of a dead-eye
from Alabama in last year's New Year's Day game, and
Indian fans will find out tomorrow whether Tiny Thorn
hill's Cardinal defenders have worked out an adeguate
defense for this type of game. Blower's passing and open
field running have been largely responsible for
the Bears' nine-game victory streak this year.


A. VERSATILE END is Stanford's Monk Moscrip. He kicked the field goal (pictured above) that defeated U.S.C., 3 to 0, in the
last minute two weeks ago. Moscrip, shown above and at rig ht, has the other qualifications of an all-American end he is a
defensive powerhouse, glue-fingered pass-snatcher, and is note d for the masterful way he covers punts. Moscrip field goals in
the past two years have won four games; odds are that Monk w ill attempt a couple of place kicks during tomorrow's contest.


CALIFORNIA'S BACKFIELD lined
up this way at the start of the sea
son. All four of these aces will
see action as the Bears make their
most serious bid for a Conference
championship and Rose Bowl bid
in seven years in Stanford Stadium
tomorrow. Left to right, they are
A1 (Baggy) Thorell, fullback; Bill
Archer and Floyd Blower, half
backs; and Chuck Cotton, quarter
back. Thorell is a brilliant line
plunger of the hard-driving vari
ety and will be remembered from
last year's Big Game. Archer, a
southpaw, and Blower, a right
hander, are two of the Coast's most
accurate passers; both of these
halfbacks are dangerous open field
runners. Cotton has a reputation
as a powerful blocker. This is
just one of the many backfield
combinations Stub Allison
has at his disposal.



THE AXE, mounted as a trophy, for two years has gone to the winner of
the Big Game. In 1933 Stanford won it with a 70-yard "prayer" pass, Alustiza
to Norgard. Last year Bones Hamilton crashed right end in the last guarter
for the winning points. What will it take tomorrow? Will it be Moscrip's
toe, or will it be Bobby Grayson's off-tackle slashes? Can he pierce the Bear
defense that has allowed its goal line to be crossed only once this year,
and that on a blocked kick? The California clean slate makes the Bears
slight pre-game favorites, according to Bay Region sports writers.


CAN BONES STAND IT? Will Bobby Grayson be all by himself as he is against the horde of
Washington Huskies shown at the top? Or will the hard-blocking Hamilton be pulling out ahead,
cracking down the ends and secondary, and paving the goalward march for the Boomer as he did
for three seasons until an injury shelved him ear ly this year? These are guestions that bother
Tiny Thornhill on the eve of the Big Game as he wonders about the completeness of Bones'
recovery. Grayson and Hamilton are together again on the starting line-up.
