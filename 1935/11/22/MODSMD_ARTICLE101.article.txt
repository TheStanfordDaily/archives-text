Editor's Note: Archie Itice, of the
aj class of '5)5, was Editor of (he Daily,
firsl student body treasurer, yell
leader, president of the Pioneer class,
giver of (lie name "Lagunita" to the
campus lake, and the first Stanford
graduate to enter metropolitan
journalism. Here is his interesting
letter, "written hurriedly on a res
taurant table."

As I press-reported the first 24
Big Games, have witnessed some 700
i gridiron, rugby, association, and
i Gaelic football contests,'and 43 years
ago developed football charting, my
present comments, flown across con
tinent from Washington, may have
reader interest immediately preced
ing this 41st California-Stanford
meeting for the Big Game, an event
IW that latterly has ranked as the gen-
I r-rally largest-attended, most closely
matched, most sportsmanlike, most
dramatically colorful, and spectacu
lar and climatically favored and
high-class athletic fixture in world
history of outdoor sports, and with
the world's maximum number of
| intelligent women spectators.
There have been, in San Francisco.
I t Rig Games, on five different fields,
the first in March, the second in De
cember, nine on Thanksgiving, and
: the last two on the third Saturday in
November. Stanford won five, tied
four, and lost four. Attendance,
starting at 6,000 (a record outdoor
sports crowd west of Chicago prior
! io 1893), rose to 13,500 as actual
maximum, despite the traditional
J "25,000."
On Berkeley campus, there have
been 14 Big Games. Stanford won
seven, tied four, and lost three, Cali
fornia doing only three victory ser
l pentines on home campus in the last
b2 years.
j On Stanford campus there have
I been 13 Big Games. Stanford won
I seven, played no ties, and lost six.
Big Game ties have been followed
by 1, 2, 5, 2, 3, 2, Stanford victories
with never a Stanford defeat.
During the 44-year period, total
1 Big Game scores give Stanford 435
, points, California 426.
Rose Rowl teams in the 22 inter
collegiate contests include Stanford
six times (one win, one tie, and four
lost), California three > times (one
win, one tie, one lost).
Prior to use of the shift in 1906, to
foster more open rugby, the heaviest
Big Game varsity was Stanford's
1804 eleven, averaging 178; and the
heaviest individual players were
Haggard, '95, 226-pound center;
Carle, '98, 212-pound, both of Stan
ford, and Overall, '03, 201-pound
California guard.
The probable potential All-Ameri
can material of the first 15-year
period of the Big Games included:
Stanford, Williams, center; Carle,
Fickcrt and McMillan: guards;
Pragcr and Sprott, tackles; Clarke,
end; Clemans, Cotton, Murphy, and
II Chalmers, backs. California had
Overall; Womblc, end: Hunt, Ran
somc, Hall, Smith, and Snedigar,
backs. The greatest all-round kicker
of that period was Murphy with
Overall next.
The first Big Game was delayed
one hour because both teams forgot
to provide a football.
On the night of the 1894 Big Game,
Whitehouse, '96, former Stanford
varsity tackle, and Rosenfeld, '95,
sub-halfback, were seriously bullet-
I wounded and the face of McMillan,
'97, former varsity guard, was grazed
by a third bullet from a revolver
I fired at close range by Alex Lough
111 borough, disgruntled California un-
I dergraduate. Since there were no
deaths, the affair was hushed up
and settled out of court.
At the 1896 Big Game, an incipient
riot, started by California students
attacking and wrecking the Stanford
| jo re-board, was stoppe d by inrush
linci police.
The following year the roof over
9 the ccntor section, reserved for the
I "society" set. hammocked down and
I tobogganed three urchins, causing a
8 near panic, and bewilderment as to
I what had happened, so oflicials
I promptly slopped the game four
I minutes early, with Stanford near n

touchdown.
At the last of the Thanksgiving
Big Games, in .1907, fourteen spec
tators were killed by the crash-in of
a skylight atop the roof of a nearby
glass works, where about 50 "dead
heads" had assembled.
A year later, at another Big Game,
100 policemen with riot clubs, pa
trolled the sidelines to prevent
threatened mob l'eprisals by in
censed California students and
alumni, angered because "Locomo
tive" Smith had been debarred. A
neutral referee committee, composed
of alumni of 17 different eastern col
leges, and appointed by the presi
dent of the University Club of San
Francisco, had decreed unanimously
that Smith had been guilty of deceit,
of professionalism as Oregon's paid
varsity coach, and Stanford was
voted properly justified in its pro
tests and proofs.
The first Pasadena Rose Bowl
game was played on New Year's Day,
1902, before 8,000, in an 82-degree
temperature, on a dusty field. The
first furious 35-minute half, was
scoreless. In the second half, Stan
ford, with three varsity stars not at
the game, was battered until six men
were too injured to continue, while
"Mighty Michigan," using no substi
tutes in the entire game, scored eight
touchdowns, four conversions, one
field goal for 49 points to Stanford's
nothing.
That Michigan team, playing Hes
ton, Snow, Reoder, Weeds, as four
of Michigan's all-time stars, thus
completed the season of 11 games by
scoring 550 points to its opponents'
nothing.
But the greatest player on the
Pasadena field that day was Bill
Prager, Stanford tackle. I reported
the game for several papers. It was
the fastest gridiron contest I ever
charted: 220 plays in 70 minutes.
After that no Pasadena game was
played for 11 years, so the Rose Bowl
people pretend it never happened.
Oxford, Cambridge, Harvard, and
Yale are one-color colleges, and
proud of it. Wisconsin, Arkansas,
and Stanford are the only colleges in
the world using cardinal, and cardi
nal alone. Almost 40 American col
legiate institutions are blue and gold.
Olympic Athletic Club, Lowell
High School, and Santa Clara Uni
versity use red and white, and huck
sters succeed in working off such
surplus stock on Stanford partisans.
San Francisco's wholesale florists
have determined before that their
flower sales the day of the Big Game
exceed by approximately $50,000 the
flower sales of any other day in the
year. Ignorant window dressers,
wishing to balancc blue and gold by
two colors, make Stanford red and
white. And florists take greater
profits selling white chrysanthemums
with a small red carnation in the
center than from huge hunches of
red carnations alone.
The result is that many present
day Stanford collegians stupidly sup
pose Stanford's colors are "red and
white," while Stanford collegians
permit the error may they lose each
Big Game.
But I hold a hunch and a hope
that "Stanford spirit'' will prevail,
reach new heights as in 1905, anti
give Stanford a eleserved victory on
her own field in 1935.
