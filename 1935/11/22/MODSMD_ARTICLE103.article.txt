# Tanksters Clash in Crucial Battles Tomorrow
## Indians Face U.C. in Final Tilts of Year Varsity Must Down Bears For Second Place In Coast League 
### 
Determined to rout the invading
Bears from the Indian stronghold at
, Encina Pools, Stanford's yearling
I and varsity water poloists will en
| gage in the final and most crucial
| encounters of the season tomorro Â»v
! morning.
The frosh outfits will begin fes
| tivilies promptly at 10 o'clock,
while the first-stringers are sched
uled to start padd'mig it out im
mediately following the Papoosc-
Cub tussle. Admission for both
, contests will be 2f> cents to hold
ers of student-body cards.
; Despite the fact that a mighty
; Uclan septet downed both Redskins
I and Berkeleyites in close succession
last week-end, to be rewarded for
their efforts with the Pacific Coast
j Conference crown for the first time,
i water polo's Big Game still looms as
the all-important conflict as far as
the two northern aggregations are
j concerned.
By reason of their X-2 win,
j scored over the Cardinals more
than a month ago. the Californians
will enter the Farm tank as slight
favorites to dunk Stanford. To
i morrow is to be the first time in
23 years of Indian-Bear aquatic
; competition that a Berkeley squad
will have an edge over the Red
men.
Since 1912 the Indians have piled
; up 69 triumphs, while the Bears have
| won but twice. Not only will the
! former be battling to uphold Stan
j ford's traditional supremacy, but
they also will be set upon conquer -
j ing the invaders and thereby gain
j ing at least a tie for runner-up in a
! league that they've consistently led
j for 22 years.
' Coach A1 Dowden's publicized
! threat that his charges would
j "beat hell out of those red-shirts
any time" should doubtless prove
! an added incentive to the Berke
ley steptet. And a triumph to
j morrow would cinch (heir claim
; lor second place in the race for
I Coast honors.
j Coach Nort Thornton's mermen,
since they last tangled with the
j Bears, have undergone a series of
: intensive rejuvenation treatments,
I with the result that their scoring
I record since then puts them on a
I par with California. The invincible
Bruins beat Cal 3-2 and 4-3, while
; they defeated the Stanfordites 5-3
i and 1-0.
Admitting that an 8-2 drubbing
J can't be laughed ofT. the varsity
I squads shouhl take to the water
tomorrow morning much more
evenly matched than dopesters
I predict. A repetition of the tooth -
| and - nail battle witnessed last
I week-end is practically assured.
California's present tank team has
i been called the greatest intercolle
j giate outfit that ever played in Cali
fornia. All - Conference forward
' Danny Kuhns is the Bear scoring
: ace: another standout is sprint
; George Lawrence. Bolstering the
California attack will be Captain
l Jack Dozier and "Slugger" Peter
: son at the guard posts,
i An estimation of the Bears' tank
ability is seen in a comparison of
total scoring for the 1935 season.
In a total of 7 tussles the Califor
nians have tallied 12 goals against
22 collected by opponents. The
Indians, on the other hand, have
garnered X 7 counts in 11 games
while opposing forces were claim
ing but 30.
Stanford's great goalie. Bob Has
| lacher, whose severe cold sent him
I to the hospital earlier in the week,
1 was back at practice yesterday af
! ternoon. Center back Ben Voss,
j however, will not be in shape for
! tomorrow's conflict. Guard Phil
! Hanna took a crack at forward du
j ties and proved himself no less than
a sensation at yesterday's drill ses
sion. Thornton may use him at that
' post if the Cardinals are hard
J pressed tomorrow.
It will be the final game of their
j collegiate careers for Co-Captains
Waily Wiget, and Bill Woodard, for
! ward Bill Clemo, and guard "Suds"
j Sutherland.
Farm yearlings face the unde
feated Bear Cubs in a preliminary
to the varsity encounter. The
Californians are favored to rc-
J peat their 4-3 triumph of last
month, but the Papooses will be
out to submerge the Cubs' hopes
of rounding out the season with
no defeats.
Tom Boothe and Roy Winklemann,
varsity and frosh stars respectively,
will be featured in a special diving
exhibition between the two tilts.
I Both will perform from the spring
j board and tower.
Tentative lineups for the varsity
encounter are as follows:
Stanford California
Wiget sprint Lawrence
Hoover forward Kuhns
Clemo forward Smith
Giffen center back Dozier
Woodard guard S. Peterson
D. Peterson t;uard Nevyton
Ilnslaehir goalie Kent
