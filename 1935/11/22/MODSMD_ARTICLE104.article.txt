# Who's Who of Past Big Games Recalled
## Heroes In Former Grid Battles Came Into Fame Suddenly 
### Dick Friendlich, '32 
It's the Cardinal against the Blue
and Gold again tomorrow in the
battle of the gridiron giants, and out
of it will come another hero, per
haps two, whose names will be
added to the list of football greats
—names that will echo again in in
numerable chinfests to come.
The 1934 heroes will be on the
Held tomorrow, but only one of
them in the starting lineup. Bones
Hamilton, whose quick 25-yard
thrust to a touchdown put the
Indians in front last year, will
start at right half.
But the man who leaped from
obscurity to fame in 60 brief min
utes last November, will be on the
bench, waiting anxiously for his
chance to come. Carl Schott, the
third-string end, who broke the
Bear's back last year by blocking
two of Arleigh Williams' kicks and
then booting the field goal that pro
vided Stanford's margin of victory,
will watch Keith Topping race down
the field under the opening kick
off.
One of the 1 fH'.'S heroes will be
in the Stadium, too. but not in
uniform. Frank Alustiza, whose
45-yard pass to A1 Norgard sent
the Indians to a 7-1} triumph, will
watch as best he can from an auto
mobile parked above the stadium
runway.
The scoreless tie of 1932 produced
a luminary on each side. It was
Hank Schaldach, dynamic Bear
halfback, who almost single-handed
carried California to a touchdown,
and it was Stan Anderson, the Red
shirt fullback, who stopped the ad
vance with a tremendous 73-yard
punt from behind his own goal line.
But 1931 was California's year and
with it, Schaldach's. The stocky
Hank powered the Bears downfield
to the only score of the game and the
only Bear win in the past 12 years.
Stanford ran hog-wild in 1030,
with Phil MotTatt, Harlow Rothert
and Captain Ray Tandy showing
the way in the 41-0 trouncing
that set the Big Game scoring rec
ord. In 1929, a favored California
eleven was slashed to ribbons by
a rarin' tearin' chunk of dyna
mite—Walt Heinccke, 175-pound
center, who blocked a punt for
one score and made tackle after
tackle on the line of scrimmage.
Stanford won, 21-6.
A substitute fullback, Bill Sim
kins, leaped to fame in the 13-13 tie
of 1928, punching over a touchdown
through a Bear line until then un
crossed and passing to Lud Frentrup
for the tying points in the final 30
seconds of play.
Captain-elect BifT Hoffman headed
the Indian victory drive of 1927, rip
ping the Bear line apart to win, 13-6.
Dick Hyland, Ted Shipkey, and
Captain Fred Swap led the scoring
parade in the 1926 encounter as the
Indians buried poor Cal under a
six-touchdown avalanche, 41-6.
In 1925. it was Nevers, Nevers,
Nevers. Playing the finest game of
his collegiate career, the big blond
with the No. 1 jersey smashed and
smashed the Bears to their first Big
Game defeat under Andy Smith,
27-14.
Glenn Warner took over the
coaching veins at Stanford in 1924,
and the Big Game of that year
still rates tops for thrills. With
eight minutes of play remaining,
Ed Walter, until then an unknown
halfback, passed to Ted Shipkey
for one touchdown and to Cuddc

back for another. Cuddeback
kicked both trie,s - for - point to
emerge the Stanford hero.
California won in 1923, 9-0, but
even in defeat Stanford produced
the best man on the field. Then a
sophomore, Ernie Nevers tore huge
holes in the Bear defense, but a
! blocked kick and a safety carried
1 California to their last victory for
eight years to come.
The Bear "Wonder Team" bowed
; itself out in 1922 with a 28-0 victory.
i It was Andy Kerr's first year at
Stanford.
