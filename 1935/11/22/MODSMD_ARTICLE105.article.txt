One a backfield man, the other a lineman. One brought Stanford
from almost certain defeat to tie the Bears, the other kicked a field goal
and cinched the Indian victory. This is the story of Biff Hoffman (left),
former captain of the Stanford team, and Carl Schott, who cinched the
Cardinal victory last year. Hoffman was the spark that gained Stanford
a 13-13 tie with California in the closing seconds of a game in which they
had trailed 13-0. Schott's field goal provided the margin of victory in
the 9-7 win over the Golden Bears last season.
