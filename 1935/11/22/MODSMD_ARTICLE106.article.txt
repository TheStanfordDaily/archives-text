# World Famed Coach Directs Card Divers
## 
### 
Local publicity rarely brings the \
name of one of Stanford's most fa- <
tr.ous sportsmen, Ernst M. Brand
ten', into the limelight. To the out- j
side sporting and Olympic world,
however, he is known as the '"Dean
of Pacific Coast Coaches," "father of
diving," and the most renowned and
important authority on diving in the
world today.
He has earned this reputation as
Coach at Stanford, three times the
coach of the American Olympic
team, and as the man who codified
and standardized diving, making
possible the modern type of com
petition based on the point sys- f
tem. "Erne" will undoubtedly re
ceive the appointment of coach of
Ihe 193(5 Olympic divers from the
Olympic committee which meets
in the East on December 4.
At the present time "Erne" is the
jidvisory director of water sports on
the campus and the present divine (
coach. During his 16 years as head j
coach of diving, water polo, and !
swimming he developed many well
known swimming champions and j
championship water-polo teams. His j
divers won Olympic championships
foi three consecutive games.
Brandstcn coached Berkeley
aquatic teams for one season. After
his year at C'al, "Erne" came over |
to the Farm. and. during bis first
>car here his Stanford team was
defeated by the ('a! team he had
developed during the previous
season.

In mentioning this incident it
might be well to remark that that is
the only time a Cal swimming ag
gregation has defeated a Stanford
team since 1915. Such a record
selves well in pointing out the abil
ity "Erne" has shown as coach. Since
Brandsten's retirement in 1931, the
present coach, Nort Thornton, has
succeeded in keeping this slate
against Cal clean.
Besides holding down the posi
tion as Olympic Coach in 1924, '28,
and \'}2, and producing men from
his Stanford diving squad as Olym
pic champs each time, "Erne"
earned a name for himself as an
athlete. A few years ago Swedish
divers led the field. As a member
of the Swedish Olympic team.
Brandstcn placed second in the
1912 games, and later became Swe
dish National Champ.
Although he is still keenly inter
ested in swimming, his efforts are
spent in producing divers for Stan
ford now. Just to show how much
interest "Erne" still retains for aqu
atic sports here on the Farm it might
be well to relate an incident that
happened last week before Stanford
water poloists met U.C.L.A. It
seems the team was sadly in need
of new trunks, but the B.A.C. budget
had been drained to the last farth
ing. Since the team needed every
advantage to beat the Bruins, "Erne"
( fit red to buy the trunks himself
rather than have them go without
llu'iii.

tion as Olympic Coach in 1924, '28,
and \'}2, and producing men from
his Stanford diving squad as Olym
pic champs each time, "Erne"
earned a name for himself as an
athlete. A few years ago Swedish
divers led the field. As a member
of the Swedish Olympic team.
Brandstcn placed second in the
1912 games, and later became Swe
dish National Champ.
Although he is still keenly inter
ested in swimming, his efforts are
spent in producing divers for Stan
ford now. Just to show how much
interest "Erne" still retains for aqu
atic sports here on the Farm it might
be well to relate an incident that
happened last week before Stanford
water poloists met U.C.L.A. It
seems the team was sadly in need
of new trunks, but the B.A.C. budget
had been drained to the last farth
ing. Since the team needed every
advantage to beat the Bruins, "Erne"
( fit red to buy the trunks himself
rather than have them go without

Local publicity rarely brings the \
name of one of Stanford's most fa- <
tr.ous sportsmen, Ernst M. Brand
ten', into the limelight. To the out- j
side sporting and Olympic world,
however, he is known as the '"Dean
of Pacific Coast Coaches," "father of
diving," and the most renowned and
important authority on diving in the
world today.
He has earned this reputation as
Coach at Stanford, three times the
coach of the American Olympic
team, and as the man who codified
and standardized diving, making
possible the modern type of com
petition based on the point sys- f
tem. "Erne" will undoubtedly re
ceive the appointment of coach of
Ihe 193(5 Olympic divers from the
Olympic committee which meets
in the East on December 4.
At the present time "Erne" is the
jidvisory director of water sports on
the campus and the present divine (
coach. During his 16 years as head j
coach of diving, water polo, and !
swimming he developed many well
known swimming champions and j
championship water-polo teams. His j
divers won Olympic championships
foi three consecutive games.
Brandstcn coached Berkeley
aquatic teams for one season. After
his year at C'al, "Erne" came over |
to the Farm. and. during bis first
>car here his Stanford team was
defeated by the ('a! team he had
developed during the previous
season.

In mentioning this incident it
might be well to remark that that is
the only time a Cal swimming ag
gregation has defeated a Stanford
team since 1915. Such a record
selves well in pointing out the abil
ity "Erne" has shown as coach. Since
Brandsten's retirement in 1931, the
present coach, Nort Thornton, has
succeeded in keeping this slate
against Cal clean.
