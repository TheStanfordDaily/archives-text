# Indian Scouts Believe Cards' Chances Good
## 
### 
Since few students have viewed
! the California Bears in action this
! year and can only formulate a rather
j timorous opinion of them by com
: parative scores, it might be well to
j interview Stanford scouts v/ho have
I objectively observed them in action
j all season to see if our fears have
i been well founded.
After talking to three of these
| scouts, Coach John Bunn, Murray
C'uddeback, and Husky Hunt, one
finds that these fears have been
i based on a correct assumption,
Cal is plenty tough. They have
. power, teamwork, passers and the
i inspired ability of playing heads
' up ball for sixty minutes of every
game.
However, offsetting this view of
i the Bears, the scout trio agrees
! that the Indians' big red machine
I has the ability to cope with this
I situation more than successfully if
I they play the game as they arc
capable of playing it—if they go
into the game with plenty of fire
and determination—and if they
| play their best game of the season.
1 This is the general belief held by
' the men who have seen California
| in action this season and who are
in an excellent position to com
ment on tomorrow's tild.t
Fiom watching the Santa Clara, St.
! Mary's, and U.S.C. games Coach
John Bunn has observed Cal to be a
I well-balanced unit. No particular
! part or member of the team is re-
I sponsible for its strength.

The team has worked as a team j
being alert and ready to take all the
breaks. Their attack is not brilliant j
but just a steady, consistent drive. |
Their kicking yardage is not up to
ihj Indians' so far. Their ends are
not as strong as ours, especially in |
defense.
Although lacking any one type i
of star or combination, Bunn admits j
that it is the best Berkeley team he
has seen since he has been on the
Coast. "The harmony and teamwork 1
is the secret of their strength."
In spite of this fact and unfavor
able comparative scores, Bunn be- j
lieves that Stanford has the edge. !
For the Indians will go into that
game as the so-called underdogs ;
with the same psychological advan- I
tage which spelled victory for the j
Bruins a few weeks ago.
Besides (his, many of the Stan- J
f«'rd players are in for their last i
conference game. For many of j
them this contest culminates a sue- !
cessful athletic career, depending i
on tomorrow's game and their in- j
dividual performances. Califor- I
nia men will decidedly lack this |
advantage since the Bear varsity |
is composed to a large degree of i
sophs and juniors. Thus the Stan- j
ford team goes in the game with |
a highly emotional setup which I
should he plenty hard to crush.
Murray Cuddeback forms his |
opinion of Cal from the games he
saw them play this season against
P.S.C., U.C.L.A., and the College of
the Pacific.
He observed that the Bears are
deeper in reserves than the Indians,
that the lines are almost equal. Cal
has the advantage of combining a
gieater number of different players
which Coach Stub Allison has been
practicing all season, and their
passers and receivers click.
So far, they have not tried any de
ception, but depend mainly on
straight running power plays. Every
man plays an alert game and the
ends are always down to cover up |
on the kicks.
"If our line charges and does not
play a waiting game, it will be su
perior (o Cal's," says Husky Hunt.
The Bears have an entirely differ
ent backfield than Stanford's which
is built around one man.
From seeing the Cards and Cali
fornia play Washington, Santa
Clara, and College of the Pacific,
Husky thinks (hat the game will
depend a great deal 011 (he atti
tude of both teams. If the Indians
play up to what they are capable
of doing fhey have a chance.
Right now Cal definitely has the
edge. Their passing attack is better,
and Stanford looks weak in the
scoring punch, since they have e>nly
scored three touchdowns in five
games.
Hunt states the present Cal team
Ihe best since Andy Smith left Cal,
and Herwig as their most valuable
man, if it is possible to single out
players from the team as a whole.

' the men who have seen California

in an excellent position to com

Fiom watching the Santa Clara, St.
! Mary's, and U.S.C. games Coach
John Bunn has observed Cal to be a
I well-balanced unit. No particular
! part or member of the team is re-
I sponsible for its strength.

The team has worked as a team j
being alert and ready to take all the
breaks. Their attack is not brilliant j
but just a steady, consistent drive. |
Their kicking yardage is not up to
ihj Indians' so far. Their ends are
not as strong as ours, especially in |
defense.
Although lacking any one type i
of star or combination, Bunn admits j
that it is the best Berkeley team he
has seen since he has been on the
Coast. "The harmony and teamwork 1
is the secret of their strength."
In spite of this fact and unfavor
able comparative scores, Bunn be- j
lieves that Stanford has the edge. !
For the Indians will go into that
game as the so-called underdogs ;
with the same psychological advan- I
tage which spelled victory for the j
Bruins a few weeks ago.
Besides (his, many of the Stan- J
f«'rd players are in for their last i
conference game. For many of j
them this contest culminates a sue- !
cessful athletic career, depending i
on tomorrow's game and their in- j
dividual performances. Califor- I
nia men will decidedly lack this |
advantage since the Bear varsity |
is composed to a large degree of i
sophs and juniors. Thus the Stan- j
ford team goes in the game with |
a highly emotional setup which I
should he plenty hard to crush.
Murray Cuddeback forms his |
opinion of Cal from the games he
saw them play this season against
P.S.C., U.C.L.A., and the College of
the Pacific.
He observed that the Bears are
deeper in reserves than the Indians,
that the lines are almost equal. Cal
has the advantage of combining a
gieater number of different players
which Coach Stub Allison has been
practicing all season, and their
passers and receivers click.
So far, they have not tried any de
ception, but depend mainly on
straight running power plays. Every
man plays an alert game and the
ends are always down to cover up |
on the kicks.
"If our line charges and does not
play a waiting game, it will be su
perior (o Cal's," says Husky Hunt.
The Bears have an entirely differ
ent backfield than Stanford's which
is built around one man.
From seeing the Cards and Cali
fornia play Washington, Santa
Clara, and College of the Pacific,
Husky thinks (hat the game will
depend a great deal 011 (he atti
tude of both teams. If the Indians
play up to what they are capable
of doing fhey have a chance.
Right now Cal definitely has the
edge. Their passing attack is better,
and Stanford looks weak in the
scoring punch, since they have e>nly
scored three touchdowns in five
games.
Hunt states the present Cal team
Ihe best since Andy Smith left Cal,
and Herwig as their most valuable
man, if it is possible to single out
players from the team as a whole.
Since few students have viewed
! the California Bears in action this
! year and can only formulate a rather
j timorous opinion of them by com
: parative scores, it might be well to
j interview Stanford scouts v/ho have
I objectively observed them in action
j all season to see if our fears have
i been well founded.
After talking to three of these
| scouts, Coach John Bunn, Murray
C'uddeback, and Husky Hunt, one

1 This is the general belief held by
' the men who have seen California
| in action this season and who are
in an excellent position to com
ment on tomorrow's tild.t
Fiom watching the Santa Clara, St.
! Mary's, and U.S.C. games Coach
John Bunn has observed Cal to be a
I well-balanced unit. No particular
! part or member of the team is re-
I sponsible for its strength.

The team has worked as a team j
being alert and ready to take all the
breaks. Their attack is not brilliant j
but just a steady, consistent drive. |
Their kicking yardage is not up to
ihj Indians' so far. Their ends are
not as strong as ours, especially in |
defense.
Although lacking any one type i
of star or combination, Bunn admits j
that it is the best Berkeley team he
has seen since he has been on the
Coast. "The harmony and teamwork 1
is the secret of their strength."
In spite of this fact and unfavor
able comparative scores, Bunn be- j
lieves that Stanford has the edge. !
For the Indians will go into that
game as the so-called underdogs ;
with the same psychological advan- I
tage which spelled victory for the j
Bruins a few weeks ago.
Besides (his, many of the Stan- J
f«'rd players are in for their last i
conference game. For many of j
them this contest culminates a sue- !
cessful athletic career, depending i
on tomorrow's game and their in- j
dividual performances. Califor- I
nia men will decidedly lack this |
advantage since the Bear varsity |
is composed to a large degree of i
sophs and juniors. Thus the Stan- j
ford team goes in the game with |
a highly emotional setup which I
should he plenty hard to crush.
Murray Cuddeback forms his |
opinion of Cal from the games he
saw them play this season against
P.S.C., U.C.L.A., and the College of
the Pacific.
He observed that the Bears are
deeper in reserves than the Indians,
that the lines are almost equal. Cal
has the advantage of combining a
gieater number of different players
which Coach Stub Allison has been
practicing all season, and their
passers and receivers click.
So far, they have not tried any de
ception, but depend mainly on
straight running power plays. Every
man plays an alert game and the
ends are always down to cover up |
on the kicks.
"If our line charges and does not
play a waiting game, it will be su
perior (o Cal's," says Husky Hunt.
The Bears have an entirely differ
ent backfield than Stanford's which
is built around one man.
From seeing the Cards and Cali
fornia play Washington, Santa
Clara, and College of the Pacific,
Husky thinks (hat the game will
depend a great deal 011 (he atti
tude of both teams. If the Indians
play up to what they are capable
of doing fhey have a chance.
Right now Cal definitely has the
edge. Their passing attack is better,
and Stanford looks weak in the
scoring punch, since they have e>nly
scored three touchdowns in five
games.
Hunt states the present Cal team
Ihe best since Andy Smith left Cal,
and Herwig as their most valuable
man, if it is possible to single out
players from the team as a whole.
