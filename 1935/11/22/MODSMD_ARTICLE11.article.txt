# Gaieties Cast Ready for 8:30 Curtain Tonight
## Original Songs and Skits Feature Production 
### 
The curtain for the 1935 Big
Game Gaieties will rise at 8:30 o'-
clock tonight in the Assembly Hall.
With choruses well trained and skits
letter-perfect, the show promises
to be one of the best Gaieties in
recent years, both financially and
artistically.
All tickets were sold out before
9:30 o'clock yesterday morning,
three days before the perfor
mance, although the box office
will open at 7:30 o'clock this eve
ning for the benefit of season tic
ket holders and those who have
reserved seats.
Orchestras playing for the affair
will be those of Gordon Heche, who
played for last year's Gaieties, and
Fred Nagel, who played for the
"Folies Bourgeois" last spring.
Among the skits turned in by
various houses and living groups
are the S.A.E. opera, which gives
its own story of the Big Game; a
colorful scene in czarist Russia,
done by the combined forces of Pi
Phi's and Delts; and the Alpha Phi's
burlesque surgical operation.
Lagunita has also turned in a
burlesque of a Sword and San
dals reading, the Kappas have a
novelty entitled "The Woman
Pays," and the Betas arc sponsor
ing ;i representation of a B.A.C.
meeting.
Among the songs written for the
show are two by Dudley Nix, "It's
Just the Principle of the Thing" and
"The Freshman Glide"; "Night Cry"
by Elizabeth Rhodes and Mark Joy;
two by the team of Mac Gordon and
Frank O'Neill, "The Wind and the
Rain" and "What Makes You Think
I Do?" and Dulce Parker's "Falling
Star."
