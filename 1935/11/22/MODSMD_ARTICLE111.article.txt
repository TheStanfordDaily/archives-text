# Clamor for Scoring Change Anticipated
## 
### 
football's annual quest for im
provements this year is blossoming |
out in a full-fledged campaign for a !
revision in scoring.
With half a dozen major teams'
seasons wrecked on the rocks of a
single missed conversion, and other
teams upset by slim margins, indi
cations are officials may do more than
consider the matter of counting tal
lies differently next fall.
Standout suggestions are the usual
cry for counting first downs and a
revision of conversion scoring.
Had first downs been counted this
year—one point for each or one point
, for a certain number—Stanford's
i eleven today would be ranked with
the unbeaten teams of the country
and California's "How-do-they-do
it?' team would be just another j
pretty goot outfit.
Another recommendation, made
by Davis J. Walsh, an eastern sports
writer, is a graduated system of
scoring the extra point. Suggesting
that a kick for goal count one point
Mr. Walsh says:
"The rules committee has been
and a run or pass give two points,
trving for years to get. teams to run
or pass for this conversion point.
Show them where you can get more
for trying the hard way and Ihey'U
I show they're willing to go after a
I victory almost any time, instead of

1 a tie.
Supporters of the Hrst-dowu scor
ing point out teams have frequently
been known to far outgain their op
poivents, but lose by one or two
points. In the Stanford-U.C.L.A
game, for instance, the Indians had
a wide margin of gains, but one slip
on conversion lost the game. Later
U.C.L.A. outgained the Bears, but
couldn't push over the goal line.
Proponents of the present system
can fight the recommended changes
on the grounds they favor the of
fensive just as this year's new pass
ing rules gave the offense the breaks.
Teams which rely on defense ;
would unquestionably be at a dis
advantage unless they had an air
tight system and could prevent for
ward advances.
| But with the fact 15 major games ,
' were decided by one-point margins i
j in a month this fall, it is safe to pre
dict officials will do much brow
wrinkling before they turn thumbs
down on conversion graduations or
| first down scoring.
I This year's tremendous increase
, in grid deaths may give the rules
committee something else to worry
over. But as in past years, the group
probably will decide most deaths are
ignored and vote that not much can
due to sandlot games where rules are
be done to make the game safer. I
