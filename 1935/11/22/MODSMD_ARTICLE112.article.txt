# Frosh Gridmen On Cage Team
## Bradshaw's Babes Drilling For Winter Season 
### 
With about a week's practice be
hind them, frosh hoopsters under
Coach Jim Bradshaw are going
through a routine of drills and for
mations preparatory to a possible
series of games to be played during
Christmas holidays, as well as the
I regular scheduled winter quarter
: games.
A paucity in outstanding men
weakens the squad and makes
it look rather doubtful if it will
be 011 a par with frosh teams of
the past. From the .'»2 men now
tarried on the squad, only three
may be listed as really outstand
ing prospects.
I Promising men listed by Brad
: shaw are: Phil Zonne, from Los An
i geles High School, Charles Fisher,
former Washington prop player, and
Jack Kessell, from the Lowell High
lightweights.
Bradshaw has received ten men
from the ranks of I lie frosh football
squad. Of these three of the year
lings look like they might furnish
valuable material. They are Byron
West, tackle; Wally DeWitt, full
back and co-captain, and Lyman
Calkins, end.
The present squad will be cut
to 20 men at the end of the quar-
Brittinghams, at least one of whom !
wiii see action at end tomorrow, also j
constitute a serious threat to Stan- \
ford supremacy.
The Bear 'oackfield as a whole, j
probably to include Howard at full; |
Chapman at right half; Fowler, left j
half; and Meek at quarter, falls a bit :
short of the Stanford power in the |
same department.
Grayson's a sharpshooter when
it comes to arming passes, and he's
always been in there when he's
been supposed to receive lately, j
Hamilton will be at right half to j
block Lutz on Hobby's best run- 1
ning plays, which invariably go
to bis right. Also Coilis is no mean i
safety, and he can run back that
pigskin. Paulman is an accurate
passer and he's also been polish
ing up bis kicking efficiency a bit. j
Moscrip and Topping intend to J
show Sparks and Bob Brittingham i
exactly how to play end. Moscrip's I
ability has been mentioned, while j
both have proved their prowess all j
season.
The whole thing resolves itself |
into a final prediction that Stanford j
should end up on the long side of a
close score. But, like it was at the
outset, there's always California to
be considered when one talks of Big
Games.
The Indians have an edge when it
comes to man-to-man comparison.
But Bear reserves and the lact that
California's record as a team puts
her at the top Conference rating is
no small point in the Bears' favor. I

With about a week's practice be

Coach Jim Bradshaw are going
through a routine of drills and for
mations preparatory to a possible
series of games to be played during
Christmas holidays, as well as the
I regular scheduled winter quarter
: games.
A paucity in outstanding men
weakens the squad and makes
it look rather doubtful if it will
be 011 a par with frosh teams of
the past. From the .'»2 men now
tarried on the squad, only three
may be listed as really outstand
ing prospects.
I Promising men listed by Brad
: shaw are: Phil Zonne, from Los An
i geles High School, Charles Fisher,
former Washington prop player, and
Jack Kessell, from the Lowell High
lightweights.
Bradshaw has received ten men
from the ranks of I lie frosh football
squad. Of these three of the year
lings look like they might furnish
valuable material. They are Byron
West, tackle; Wally DeWitt, full
back and co-captain, and Lyman
Calkins, end.
The present squad will be cut
to 20 men at the end of the quar-
Brittinghams, at least one of whom !

constitute a serious threat to Stan- \
ford supremacy.
