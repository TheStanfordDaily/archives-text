# Past Big Game Grid Files Show Score Contrasts
## Famous Tilt of 1924 Recalled as Farm Records Tell of 43 Bear-Indian Contests 
### 
Immortalized in the memory of Stanford alumni is the Big Game of Big
Games —the famed classic that was played eleven years ago today, the
tooth and nail battle that ended in a 20-20 tie.
The Golden Bears were doped to win that game handily. Perhaps a few
loyal Californians might rate Stanford as the underdog for tomorrow, hut
hack in 1924 on the eve of that conflict there were even more than a few
rooters on the Farm who were beginning to fear for Pop Warner's Indians
in the Big Game. In short, the lilt ♦

w;is supposedly on ice for California.
For one thing, Ernie Nevers, Stan -
ford's All-American fullback, was
out with a broken ankle, and then,
to make matters worse, Norm Clea
veland was declared ineligible the
day before the battle. It is true that
Cal did justify dopesters' predictions
for over 55 minutes of grueling play,
for with but five minutes to go and
the crowd already beginning to leave
the stadium the Cardinals were trail
ing. 20-6.
Then Murray Cuddeback, now
head scout for the Indians, began to
toss a few passes. One finally clicked
for a touchdown, and Cuddeback
gave Stanford another point with a
perfect conversion. Another series
of Cuddeback passes, another tally,
and then another Cuddeback con
version just as the final gun sounded.
The Indians, or rather Cuddeback
himself, had pulled the game out of
the fire, and ever since that me
morable day the fans have stayed to
witness the last minute of Big Games.
These grid enthusiasts were not
to be disappointed. Again in 1928
the Indians gained a tie in a thrilling
finish. With less than a minute to
go, Bill Simpkins rifled a pass to
Lud Frentrup for a score that put
the Cardinals on a par with tht
Bears, 13-13.
Bolstered by the line-plunging of
Chuck Smalling and the pass-snag
ging of Captain Mush Muller, Stan
ford's attack was functioning per
fectly in 1929 and Cal "went down to
defeat, 21-6. A record for Big Game
scores was hung up the very next
year when the Big Red Machine
proved its mettle to triumph, 41-0.
Lean years were to follow. The
Bears avenged their defeats by nos
ing out the Indians in 1931, 6-0. Then
in '32 Stanford came within inches
of scoring in the first period, then
fully as close to losing in the final
quarter when Hank Schaldach led a
California 60-yard drive within the
last four minutes. Only the gun
saved Stanford. The score, 0-0.
Nineteen thirty-three found Stan
ford coming to the top in the Big
Game cycle. The game wasn't won
until the fourth quarter, neverthe
less, when Ihe Alustiza-to-Norgard
passing combination went 70 yards
for the only touchdown. The score
board read 7-3.
Last year it was nip and tuck un
til well into the third period when
Bones Hamilton, behind perfect in
terference, carried the ball over foi
an only touchdown and Schott place
kicked a field goal soon after. Tiny's
gridsters settled back on the defen
sive from this point on, and, al
though a California tally in the final
minutes caused no little worry, the
festivities came to an end with an
other Indian victory, this time 9-7.
