# Frosh Gridders Show '36 Varsity Prospects
## 
### 
Most of Stanford's first-string!
i football players will engage in their
last Big Game tomorrow, but the
I 1936 varsity eleven will not bo se
i rioiisly short of capable gridders.
! Tiny Thornhill's worries will be
I greatly reduced when the men from
j the '39 frosh (urn out. i
Coached by Jimmy Bradshaw, ;
the yearlings won four of their 1
|. six games during the season just a
j closed, and scored touchdowns
j against both the U.S.C. frosh and !
the Bear Cubs, the only teams to (
| defeat them. I
With the aid of Assistant Coaches 1
i John Bunn, Walt Heinecke, Stan An- *
dtrson, and Harold Easterbrook, '
Bradshaw developed several good
prospects for next year and later -
j seasons.
Outstanding in the line were Pete
! Zagar, 210-pound tackle from Ros
| lyn, Washington, and Dick Sutton,
j 190-pound center from Lowell High
j School of San Francisco.
Three guards carried most of
the burden for the Indian babes.
They were Frank McMillan on the
left side of center, and Bob Shreve i
and Fred Gustafson on the right,
j McMillan is built like an oil drum,
! and is just about as big an ob
stacle. Shreve was injured most

of the season, but the 160-pound
midget looked good against the
Ut'ars. Gustafson, who also plays
soccer, rounds out a trio which
may fill the shoes of Larry Rou
ble and Woody Adams next fall.
Irv Cummings was Stojkovich's
rival for right end, and Walt Hege
; nd Don Butler manned the other
fk.nk. All three are good ends but
wore handicapped by injuries.
Four able-bodied players com
posed the regular backfield â€” Ed
Gamier, quarterback; Pete Fay and
Eil! Kirsch, halves; and Wally de-
Wilt, full. Jack Huebel, Henry
Glasser, Louis Veenker, A1 Alus-
and Ken Jordan were others
who shone in (he secondary.
