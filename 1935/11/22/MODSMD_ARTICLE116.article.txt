# Fair Sex Lacking in Grid 'Savoir Faire'

### ANNALEE WHITMORE 
Gone are the days when a fancy |
femme felt duty bound to attend
games clad as for a tea and leaving
brains behind them. Such remarks
as, "Oh, that cute little ball! Why
do they all jump cn it so?" have j
gone into the discard along with
bustles and beauty-marks.
Now at least one out of every
five co-eds can predict intelli- 1
gently whether the play will he a
pass or a kick, and call fouls be- j
fore the announcement is made. j
The white-shirt rule for rooting
sections has eliminated the necessity [
for high heels and frills. But the
feminine contingent isn't perfect.
And we'd like to register the fol
lowing specific gripes:
Why do supposedly intelligent i
women still gaze down, enraptured, I
at some thug in football clothes and
say, "I do wish Tiny would send
in Bill—he sits in my history sec- \
tion, and he has the cutest profile!"
Or how about the dizzy dame on
your right who chooses the mo
ment when the home team is on
the two-yard line, third down,
and Grayson taking the ball on a
line plunge, to apply lipstick?
And she of the insatiable appetite,
who first buys peanuts, then candy, :
then gum, then cigarettes, and you
have to pass her dime meekly over j

to the aisle and pass back the change
and the food. And then lend her
matches. To top it all, she usually j
drifts peanut shells over all the sur
sounding territory, including your
freshly cleaned coat.
Ever bought a program? If you
did, didn't the dame in front of
you borrow it to look up her pets,
1 and then keep it as an eye shade?
Probably.
Another terror is the near-sight
' cd woman who wants to look up
j friends in the crowd. You, of course, '
have to look for them. And there
you are, craning your neck re
luctantly, when the first touchdown
, is scored, looking for Susie Jane
i Sears, of whom you never heard
I nor wanted to.
Less purposefully obnoxious,
but still a menace, is the co-ed
who thinks she'll be cold and has
had girl scout training—she wants
to be prepared. So she brings a
sweater, wears a coat, carries a
white jacket to put on during the '
| stunts, has cigarettes, purse, hat
which she doesn't wear, program, l
and thus takes up at least two
seats.

Gone are the days when a fancy |
femme felt duty bound to attend
games clad as for a tea and leaving
brains behind them. Such remarks
as, "Oh, that cute little ball! Why
do they all jump cn it so?" have j
gone into the discard along with
bustles and beauty-marks.
Now at least one out of every
five co-eds can predict intelli- 1
gently whether the play will he a
pass or a kick, and call fouls be- j
fore the announcement is made. j
The white-shirt rule for rooting
sections has eliminated the necessity [
for high heels and frills. But the
feminine contingent isn't perfect.
And we'd like to register the fol
lowing specific gripes:
Why do supposedly intelligent i
women still gaze down, enraptured, I
at some thug in football clothes and
say, "I do wish Tiny would send
in Bill—he sits in my history sec- \
tion, and he has the cutest profile!"
Or how about the dizzy dame on
your right who chooses the mo
ment when the home team is on
the two-yard line, third down,
and Grayson taking the ball on a
line plunge, to apply lipstick?
And she of the insatiable appetite,
who first buys peanuts, then candy, :
then gum, then cigarettes, and you
have to pass her dime meekly over j

to the aisle and pass back the change
and the food. And then lend her
matches. To top it all, she usually j
drifts peanut shells over all the sur
sounding territory, including your
freshly cleaned coat.
Ever bought a program? If you
did, didn't the dame in front of
you borrow it to look up her pets,
1 and then keep it as an eye shade?
Probably.
Another terror is the near-sight
' cd woman who wants to look up
j friends in the crowd. You, of course, '
have to look for them. And there
you are, craning your neck re
luctantly, when the first touchdown
, is scored, looking for Susie Jane
i Sears, of whom you never heard
I nor wanted to.
Less purposefully obnoxious,
but still a menace, is the co-ed
who thinks she'll be cold and has
had girl scout training—she wants
to be prepared. So she brings a
sweater, wears a coat, carries a
white jacket to put on during the '
| stunts, has cigarettes, purse, hat
which she doesn't wear, program, l
and thus takes up at least two
seats.
