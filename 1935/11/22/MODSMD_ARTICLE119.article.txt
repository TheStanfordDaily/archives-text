# Spotlight Shines On Big Band Chieftain

### Phil Klauber 
After the Monday morning quar
terbacks have exhausted the discus
sion covering the football players
and coaches themselves, nearly al
ways the conversation turns to criti
cism, both favorable and not so, of a
semi-obscure figure. '
He is rarely talked of by name,
but is simply called "the guy who
leads the Stanford Band." It's high
time he came out of his seclusion,
.so here he is:
Bill Okker is the name; Stan
forditcs of ten years ago will re
member him as a varsity basket
ball player, and the tallest man
ever to attend the University. His
red hair is approximately six feet,
eight inches off the ground, and the
Coldstream Guards chapeau he
wears in public appearances is 30
inches high, giving him, by simple
calculation, a total elevation of
nine feet, two Inches. The goal
post crossbar has a clearance of
some four inches over this figure:
watch how Bill decreases his
prance when passing thereunder.
Okker makes his tenth Big Game
appearance tomorrow. He first led
tlie Stanford Band in the 1925 game,
the year Ernie Nevers and his mates
won a 27-14 victory. Since then
Stanford has won or tied every Big
Game, except in 1931, when Bill
could not appear due to illness, and
there is still some question in his
mind whether the loss should be
credited to Hank Schaldach or to
Okker's absence.
Recent years have made it hard
for Okker to appear on the campus
to practice with the band. He spends
his time at the Lane Hospital in San
Francisco, completing his last year
in the Stanford School of Medicine,
ditching his scalpels and bandages
Thursday afternoons in time for a
weekly hour-and-a-half drill with
the band.
An added "duty" is training his
assistant drum-majoress, the bru
nette who has been twirling a baton '
behind him at several recent games. ,
She is Alice Swift, a junior in bac- 1
teriology.
The hand fellows like Okker be
cause of his jolly attitude, and
they respect him because he knows
what he is doing, if anyone does. :
On the field he takes all respon- ,
sibility for any "hutches," saying
all the ranks have to do is obey his .
orders and he'll get them out of
the tangles, or take the conse- 1
quences. The more slip-ups he
makes, in dropping his stick or 1
forgetting to load his .32, the
bioader is the grin on that red
face as he struts back through his '

j charges on the next maneuver.
The Stanford Band maneuvers arc
Okker maneuvers; he inherits or
copies them from no one. One usu
ally formulates in his mind during
a Thursday afternoon drill. Before
the day is done, he has settled upon
a baton signal for his new brain
child, and before the week is done
it is presented to a football audience
for approval. Frequently before the
season is over other university
bands present it to football audi
! enees.
His fam& as a band leader h as
j traveled, as is evidenced by the fact
that his siren-whistle wits sent last
year as a gift frqm a London drum
major. Okker has conducted many
classes in baton (lipping for nearby
college and high school students.
Before each game he tells the
boys in the red coats his approxi
mate plans for the day's perform
ance. After that, it is up to them
to keep a sharp eye on that ba
ton, as almost invariably some
unexpected condition will neces
sitate a change in program.
The maneuvers are all conveyed
I to the marchers by the baton posi
tions, of which the new band mem
bers must learn about fifteen. When
one signal signifies three or four sep
arate movements, a gunshot is fired
at each proper time.
Okker tries above all to keep the
, character of his band true to the
school it represents: he limits it to
j 80 pieces, small for a college band,
to present selectivity, and he keeps
its uniforms standard and marching
tempo moderate to uphold dignity.

The Stanford Band maneuvers arc
Okker maneuvers; he inherits or
copies them from no one. One usu
ally formulates in his mind during
a Thursday afternoon drill. Before
the day is done, he has settled upon
a baton signal for his new brain
child, and before the week is done
it is presented to a football audience
for approval. Frequently before the
season is over other university
bands present it to football audi
! enees.
His fam& as a band leader h as
j traveled, as is evidenced by the fact
that his siren-whistle wits sent last
year as a gift frqm a London drum
major. Okker has conducted many
classes in baton (lipping for nearby
college and high school students.
Before each game he tells the
boys in the red coats his approxi
mate plans for the day's perform
ance. After that, it is up to them
to keep a sharp eye on that ba
ton, as almost invariably some
unexpected condition will neces
sitate a change in program.
The maneuvers are all conveyed
I to the marchers by the baton posi
tions, of which the new band mem
bers must learn about fifteen. When
one signal signifies three or four sep
arate movements, a gunshot is fired
at each proper time.
Okker tries above all to keep the
, character of his band true to the
school it represents: he limits it to
j 80 pieces, small for a college band,
to present selectivity, and he keeps
its uniforms standard and marching
tempo moderate to uphold dignity.
After the Monday morning quar
terbacks have exhausted the discus
sion covering the football players
and coaches themselves, nearly al
ways the conversation turns to criti
cism, both favorable and not so, of a
semi-obscure figure. '
He is rarely talked of by name,
but is simply called "the guy who
leads the Stanford Band." It's high
time he came out of his seclusion,
.so here he is:
Bill Okker is the name; Stan
forditcs of ten years ago will re
member him as a varsity basket
ball player, and the tallest man
ever to attend the University. His
red hair is approximately six feet,
eight inches off the ground, and the
Coldstream Guards chapeau he
wears in public appearances is 30
inches high, giving him, by simple
calculation, a total elevation of
nine feet, two Inches. The goal
post crossbar has a clearance of
some four inches over this figure:
watch how Bill decreases his
prance when passing thereunder.
Okker makes his tenth Big Game
appearance tomorrow. He first led
tlie Stanford Band in the 1925 game,
the year Ernie Nevers and his mates
won a 27-14 victory. Since then
Stanford has won or tied every Big
Game, except in 1931, when Bill
could not appear due to illness, and
there is still some question in his
mind whether the loss should be
credited to Hank Schaldach or to
Okker's absence.
Recent years have made it hard
for Okker to appear on the campus
to practice with the band. He spends
his time at the Lane Hospital in San
Francisco, completing his last year
in the Stanford School of Medicine,
ditching his scalpels and bandages
Thursday afternoons in time for a
weekly hour-and-a-half drill with
the band.
An added "duty" is training his
assistant drum-majoress, the bru
nette who has been twirling a baton '
behind him at several recent games. ,
She is Alice Swift, a junior in bac- 1
teriology.
The hand fellows like Okker be
cause of his jolly attitude, and
they respect him because he knows
what he is doing, if anyone does. :
On the field he takes all respon- ,
sibility for any "hutches," saying
all the ranks have to do is obey his .
orders and he'll get them out of
the tangles, or take the conse- 1
quences. The more slip-ups he
makes, in dropping his stick or 1
forgetting to load his .32, the
bioader is the grin on that red
face as he struts back through his '

j charges on the next maneuver.
