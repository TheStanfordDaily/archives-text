# 'Vowing Sophs' Ready for Final Big Game
## Careers End Alter 3-Year Reign at Top Six Original Frosh, Plus Muller and Topping, Ready for Finale 
### 
The best bunch of all-around
football players ever assembled at
Stanford . . .
That phrase h.-is frequently been
used as descriptive of the Indians'
1933-34-35 machine, composed, for
the most part, of seniors now—but
once the famous "Vowing Sophs.'-'
They play their last Big Game to
morrow.
Still intact and on the first
string of that group are Bohhy
Grayson, Bones Hamilton, Monk
Moscrip, Larry Rouble, Woody
Adams, and Boh Reynolds.
These six, aided by Claude Calla
way and Frank Alustiza, until health
and injury forced them to quit foot
j ball, worked together as freshrmn,
and have furnished the punch that
gave Stanford two Coast champion
ships and a chance, which will be
sJettled in the stadium tomorrow, to
make it three in a row.
Although not on the original
freshman team with the "Vow
ing Sophs," Wes Midler, center,
and Keith Topping, end, have
paced their three years of varsity
football side by side with Mos
crip, Grayson, Hamilton, et al.
Which means that eight of the
eleven Indians scheduled to start
j tomorrow will be representing Stan
ford in their last Big Game, whiie
the two that dropped out en roule
will be watching the contest in
civilian attire.
' There are several others who are
i playing their last for Stanford. In
, eluded in this group is Bob Black,
Alf Brandin, Johnny Reisner, Alex
Trompas, and Ray Todd. Although
j not. slated to start, these five prob
ably will all get into the game.
As yearlings in 1932 the "Vow
ing Sophs" gathered from Penn
i sylvania, Portland. Pasadena, and
points between to begin their
! "clicking" as one of the smooth
est frosh teams in Farm history..
Their high spot of the season, the
one which prompted the famous
j vow never to lose to Southern
j California during their Stanford
i gridiron careers, was a victory
over a powerful Trobabe eleven.
The California jinx held up, and
I Stanford's best in the Little Big
Game was a (>-<> tie.
As Tiny Thornhill took over the
headman work on the varsity in
19.'!3, these sophomores gradually
I moved into first-string berths. First
|it was Grayson, Hamilton, and
; Moscrip. Hamilton was injured in
! the second game, but Reynolds,
| Alustiza, and Callaway carried on
| tluough midseason. Topping and
i Muller joined up toward the end of
! the year, as the Indians redeemed
; themselves after losing a G-0 contest
i to Washington by toppling the Tro-
I jr.ns and Bears.
Rouble and Adams, the 5-and-10
beys, took over first-string guard
duty when Bob O'Connor and Bill
I Cor bus were graduated. The 1934
season, slightly marred by a 7-7 tie
1 with Santa Clara and climaxed
I badly by Alabama's 29-13 rout in
< the Rose Bowl, was the top year for
this group.
Individual honors awarded this
i group of seniors have been many.
Grayson was unanimously chosen
on every all-Amcrican team that
was announced last year, and ei
ther Reynolds or Moscrip were
named as first-string tackle or
!
end in nearly every case.
Bones Hamilton was awarded the
Douglar Fairbanks trophy as the
most valuable player in L he country
following last year's Ross Bowl con
test, although he had been conspic
uously omitted from the all-Amer
ican selections.
Last year's mythical all-Coast
elevens included Grayson, Reynolds,
Moscrip, Hamilton, Alustiza, Top
ping, Rouble, Callaway, and Muller
i on either the first or second strings.
