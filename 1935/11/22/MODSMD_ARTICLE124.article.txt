# Gridmen's Charms Thrill Local 'Gals'
## 
### "FANNY" FAN 
Tiny may like 'em for their pass
ing or blocking, but we feminine
fans on the Farm like our grid heroes
| for their own sweet selves.
I At least 96 7-10 per cent of the
i "1100" must have noticed the length
and beauty of Monk Moscrip's eye
lashes. They are absolutely on a par
' with Joan Crawford's; and the other
3 3-10 per cent that haven't sighed
over them must be Law or Home
Econ grads, the dopes. We find that
a seat in the rear of the Reserve
Eook Room is a place you can get a
swell, first-hand view of 'em.
The charm of Bill Paulman, tall,
attractive sophomore, lies largely
in the fact that he's reputedly a
misogynist (woman-hater, to you),
which practically breaks all of our
hearts, and, at the same time, spurs
I on our efforts to bring him out
of it.
We've finally found a real Texan
| accent, and when we tell you thai
j it's accompanied by a swell sense of
: humor, you-all must know that
j we're referring to "Doc" Luckett.

Tall, blond, Adonis - like — every
femme on the campus knows that
when you say that you're talking
about Woody Adams. We've seen
groups of no less than fourteen frosh
women gazing in wonderment at
this perfect speciman of what they
| so innocently thought Stanford men
as a whole would be.
Alf Brandin's charming smile
and positively impish wink, which
we got once (and were thrilled to
death about) make him a very ap
pealing treat to feminine eyes.
Dimples are something that simply
; every girl appreciates, and we hope
i Bones Hamilton won't be embar
' rassed when we say that we like his
; better than any we've come across
' lately.
We don't think there was any one
on the team who was better natured
than the now absent Frartkie Alus
tiza, unless it is the quiet, blue-eyed
Bob Reynolds. His eyes arc a lovely
color of blue; have you noticed?
