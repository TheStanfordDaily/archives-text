When eight seniors go into their
last Big Game tomorrow, besides
fighting for a victory against the
Bears they will put all they have
get into the game for Frankie Alu
stiza. Frank played with those same
tight men when they were sopho
mores, but a hard-luck injury with
drew him from their ranks, and now
he must see them play Saturday
from the sidelines.
The Basque's grid career was
finally ended during the third
quarter of the Stanford Ucla game
when a blow on his eye tore the
retina away from his eyeball.
Having partially lost his eyesight
he was put under the care of several
wtll-known doctors, and after a
thorough examination Doctor Hans
Balkan, acting surgeon, decided that
an operation was necessary.
Dr. Balkan is permitting Frank
to leave the Stanford Lane Hospi
tal for the first time Saturday
when he will witness the Indian-
Bear battle. lie is to be in a closed
car in the southeast end of the
Stanford stadium where the fur
long tunnel stretches down the
Card's side of the bowl. Here he
will be undisturbed, and his vi
sion will be clearest.
Alter the Big Game Alustiza will
be returned to the hospital where he
will remain until his eye is suffi
ciently healed for him to be active.
