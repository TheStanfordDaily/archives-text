# Extensive Hoop Drills Begin Monday
## Cagers Beat Alumni Five In Practice Coach Bunn's Men Wind Up Early Season, Head For Winter Play 
### 
With a victory over a pick-tip
alumni five yesterday, Coach John
Bunn's; cagers wound up their early
season drill, and will begin point
ing toward the winter season next
week, after the Big Game is for
gotten.
Bunn plans to work his men in
daily scrimmage sessions from
next week until the first game,
scheduled for December 22, one
month from tonight.
The proposed trip to Washington
after Christmas was still hanging in
the fire last night. Bunn had re
ceived no final okeh from Husky
authorities assenting to the dates of
December 27 and 28.
Starring against the alumni yes
terday were, as usual, Captain Dinty
Moore and Hank Luisetti. This pair
light now is being picked as odds
on candidates for the all-Coast team,
to be picked early next March.
Moore, the Coast's choice last year
for one of the guard posts, is still
Ihe alert defensive and aggressive
offensive man that carried him to
the captaincy this, his junior year.
Luisetti, last year's frosh cap
tain and scorer of a 2ft-point av
erage for ail of the frosh games,
remains the best shot on the team,
and will he on top in that depart
ment throughout the Coast this
year. Besides being able to hit the
basket from most any angle, he is
a classic example of "the thorn in
the side" of enemy fives with his
floorwork.
Also outstanding in the alumni
tilt was Bob Zcnne, big guard, who
helps the forwards on offense by
coming in and tapping the ball in
on rebounds.
At center was lanky Art Stoefen,
brother of the famous tennis player,
;.nd quite a pivot man on the floor.
Playing his first year on the varsity,
Stoefen will improve with experi
ence as the season goes on.
In place of Howell Turner, who
is devoting most of his spare time
these days to intramural football,
v/as Bill Quade, junior forward.
With the close of mural football
next week Turner is expected to be
back in his old place as Luisetti's
running mate, but Quade is showing
a nice improvement over last year
as a promising first-line sub.
Providing competition for the var
sity was a competent alumni five,
composed of hoop stars of the past
three or four years.
Most interesting figure for the
grads was Harlow Rothert, pres
ent alumni secretary. Harlow,
who was hoop captain here in 1931,
still shows the class that made him
one of the country's best athletes
in '30.
Also playing were Rod Bost, Arne
Anderson, Wytze Goiter, and Robin
Lindsey of the 1935 varsity, and
Marvie Kahn and Jack Cosgrove.

offensive man that carried him to
the captaincy this, his junior year.
Luisetti, last year's frosh cap
tain and scorer of a 2ft-point av
erage for ail of the frosh games,
remains the best shot on the team,
and will he on top in that depart
ment throughout the Coast this
year. Besides being able to hit the
basket from most any angle, he is
a classic example of "the thorn in
the side" of enemy fives with his
floorwork.
Also outstanding in the alumni
tilt was Bob Zcnne, big guard, who
helps the forwards on offense by
coming in and tapping the ball in
on rebounds.
At center was lanky Art Stoefen,
brother of the famous tennis player,
;.nd quite a pivot man on the floor.
Playing his first year on the varsity,
Stoefen will improve with experi
ence as the season goes on.
In place of Howell Turner, who
is devoting most of his spare time
these days to intramural football,
v/as Bill Quade, junior forward.
With the close of mural football
next week Turner is expected to be
back in his old place as Luisetti's
running mate, but Quade is showing
a nice improvement over last year
as a promising first-line sub.
Providing competition for the var
sity was a competent alumni five,
composed of hoop stars of the past
three or four years.
Most interesting figure for the
grads was Harlow Rothert, pres
ent alumni secretary. Harlow,
who was hoop captain here in 1931,
still shows the class that made him
one of the country's best athletes
in '30.
Also playing were Rod Bost, Arne
Anderson, Wytze Goiter, and Robin
Lindsey of the 1935 varsity, and
Marvie Kahn and Jack Cosgrove.
With a victory over a pick-tip
alumni five yesterday, Coach John
Bunn's; cagers wound up their early
season drill, and will begin point
ing toward the winter season next
week, after the Big Game is for
gotten.
Bunn plans to work his men in
daily scrimmage sessions from
next week until the first game,
scheduled for December 22, one
month from tonight.
The proposed trip to Washington
after Christmas was still hanging in
the fire last night. Bunn had re
ceived no final okeh from Husky
authorities assenting to the dates of
December 27 and 28.
Starring against the alumni yes
terday were, as usual, Captain Dinty
Moore and Hank Luisetti. This pair
light now is being picked as odds
on candidates for the all-Coast team,
to be picked early next March.
Moore, the Coast's choice last year
for one of the guard posts, is still
Ihe alert defensive and aggressive
offensive man that carried him to
the captaincy this, his junior year.
Luisetti, last year's frosh cap
tain and scorer of a 2ft-point av
erage for ail of the frosh games,
remains the best shot on the team,
