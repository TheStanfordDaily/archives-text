# Golfers' Practice Reveals Material For 1936 Varsity
## 
### 
Led by Verne "Spec" Stewart, who
in practice so far this season has
once tied the former Stanford course
record of 67 and has since set a new
mark of 06, the Indian varsity golf
hopefuls have been getting in a lot
of good practice but not much else,
as the competitive season doesn't get
under way until next quarter.
Some of the players showed up
pretty well in the San Jose and San
Mateo championships play, but none
managed to win a title in either
tournamcnet.
However, with the wealth of
material at hand. Coach Eddie
Twiggs is expected to turn out a
team which ought to be nearly on
a par with some of the champion
ship aggregations of the past.
Aside from Stewart, who has been
"burning up the course" on nearly
every round, he has outstanding men
in the forms of Louis Cass, Morse
Erskine, Warren Munro, Bill Colm,
and Don Edwards.
The laller two of these are at
present not even ranked in the
first ten, but in the case of Ed
wards il can be laid to the fact
thai he lias practically discontin
ued playing for this quarter in
attempting lo snap out of a slump
which has dogged him for sev
eral months.
