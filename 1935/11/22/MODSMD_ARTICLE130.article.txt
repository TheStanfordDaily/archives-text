# Babe Tankmen Face Cal Subs
## Frosh Water Poloists Hit By Loss of Sprinter 
### 
Their star player out for the sea
son, and several others barely re
covered from injuries and bad colds,
the Stanford freshmen water poloists
will face the California frosh in a
return game at 10 o'clock tomorrow
morning in Encina pool.
Beaten by the Bear Cubs, 4 to U,
two weeks ago at Berkeley in their
most recent game, Coach Jack Mur
ricta's yearlings arc decided short
enders in the dope. The main rea
son for the lÂ»ig odds on the Cubs is
(lie absence of John Lamb, sensa
tional sprint, from the Card lineup.
Lamb is out for the season with
bronchitis.
Dick Clark has taken over Lamb's
position and developed into a fairly
good player. Clark missed nearly
tv/o weeks of practice with a bad
cold, but will probably start tomor
row. Bob Allen, who was out for
mosl of the season with influenza,
and Jack Wilson, who has somehow
maintained his health, arc the other
forwards.
Winfield Needham, holder of the
A.A.U. junior national 500-yard free
siyle championship, is the center
back on the frosh septet. Bill Hatch,
Bill Crawford, and Lo Turner alter
nate at the two guard posts, with
Turner sometimes replacing Need
ham. Don Towne, who has had a
damaged knee, will probably be
ready to start in the goal against the
Bears.
This year's frosh paddlers arc a
heller team than their record indi
cates. Their loss to the Cubs was the
first in 22 years, and they arc (he
f/r'.l yearling aquati.- team lo drop a
single game since 1!).'52. but tlicy have
nitl far stronger competition than
previous outfits.
