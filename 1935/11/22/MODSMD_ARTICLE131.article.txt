# 'Dink's' Tracksters To Form Balanced Squad
## Weights To Be Strongest Point of Team 
### 
Taking a broad glance at what
should be the Stanford track squad
for 1936, one thing is pretty evident:
that Dink Templeton has the best
balanced team he has had for a long
time.
There is no one event, with the
possible exception of the pole
vault, in which the Cards can't
score against most any team in the
country—which is more than could
he said about the track teams here
in the past few years.
Best events, as they lino up after
six weeks of fall practice, arc the
weights, as usual, the hurdles, dis
tances, and high jump. Pole vault
and javelin events are so far the
scantiest.
Sam Klopstock, Jim Reynolds, A1
Hershey, Humbert Smith, Chuck
Nimmo, Phil Levy, and Ed Burrows
loom as biggest point winners. All
but the last named were among the
nation's best last spring.
Sprints
Ray Dean, Chuck Voigt, and Jim
Kneubuhl. Both Dean and Voigt
have done 9.8 at one time or an
other, but were handicapped by in
juries last year. Kneubuhl, the fast
lad from Pango-Pango, may go into
the 440.
440
Truck Del linger, A1 Cranston,
Jack Weierhauser, and Paul Greene.
As varsity relay men last year
Truck, Cranston, and Greene all
broke 50 seconds, and Weierhauser
has been running right along with
them all this fall.
Distances
Chuck Nimmo, Lloyd Davis, War
ren Dixon, Rusty March, Ed Bur
rows, Bill McCurdy, Bob Alexan
c!ei, Mort D Evelyn, and John Dern.
Nimmo will probably handle the
880, Dixon ihe mile, and Burrows
the two-mile, but any of them are
resilient enough to change around
to other combinations.
Hurdles
Sam Klopstock, Hunt and Ralph
Kingsbury, and Cy Oberg. Klop
stock, of course, the "perfect com
petitor," will be very hard to beal,
find is good for several more 11.4
high hurdles flights.
Shot and Discus
Jim Reynolds, Phil Levy, A1 Her
shey, Mel Murley, Jack King, Stan
Marks, Glenn Hamilt on, and George
Bergman. The strongest depart
ment ever. Reynolds out in front
in the shot with his 52 feet, and
Levy leading in the discus at 160.
In the shot there will probably be
five men at 48 feet, and five at 145
in the platter.

Javelin
Grant Stone, Wallace Hardin, Lee
McNitt, and Jack Kellogg. None
have done anything astounding, not
anywhere near the Mottram-Sales
high hit last year, but they all have
lots of room for advancement.
High Jump
Hum Smith, Millard Browne,
Hank Luisetti, and Rodell Johnston.
Smith rising ever higher, at 6 5 last
week, Browne saving himself for the
U.S.C. meet again, and Hank train
ing by reaching for the basketball.
Broad Jump
George Tharp, Leo Madlem, Ray
Dean, and Chuck Voight. Dean hit
24 feet in the Big Meet, Tharp did
23.2 last year, Madlem was '33 Cali
fornia prep champ, and Voight has
already hit 23 this fall.

As varsity relay men last year
Truck, Cranston, and Greene all
broke 50 seconds, and Weierhauser
has been running right along with
them all this fall.
Distances
Chuck Nimmo, Lloyd Davis, War
ren Dixon, Rusty March, Ed Bur
rows, Bill McCurdy, Bob Alexan
c!ei, Mort D Evelyn, and John Dern.
Nimmo will probably handle the
880, Dixon ihe mile, and Burrows
the two-mile, but any of them are
resilient enough to change around
to other combinations.
Hurdles
Sam Klopstock, Hunt and Ralph
Kingsbury, and Cy Oberg. Klop
stock, of course, the "perfect com
petitor," will be very hard to beal,
find is good for several more 11.4
high hurdles flights.
Shot and Discus
Jim Reynolds, Phil Levy, A1 Her
shey, Mel Murley, Jack King, Stan
Marks, Glenn Hamilt on, and George
Bergman. The strongest depart
ment ever. Reynolds out in front
in the shot with his 52 feet, and
Levy leading in the discus at 160.
In the shot there will probably be
five men at 48 feet, and five at 145
in the platter.

Javelin
Grant Stone, Wallace Hardin, Lee
McNitt, and Jack Kellogg. None
have done anything astounding, not
anywhere near the Mottram-Sales
high hit last year, but they all have
lots of room for advancement.
High Jump
Hum Smith, Millard Browne,
Hank Luisetti, and Rodell Johnston.
Smith rising ever higher, at 6 5 last
week, Browne saving himself for the
U.S.C. meet again, and Hank train
ing by reaching for the basketball.
Broad Jump
George Tharp, Leo Madlem, Ray
Dean, and Chuck Voight. Dean hit
24 feet in the Big Meet, Tharp did
23.2 last year, Madlem was '33 Cali
fornia prep champ, and Voight has
already hit 23 this fall.
Taking a broad glance at what
should be the Stanford track squad
for 1936, one thing is pretty evident:
that Dink Templeton has the best
balanced team he has had for a long
time.
There is no one event, with the
possible exception of the pole
vault, in which the Cards can't
score against most any team in the
country—which is more than could
he said about the track teams here
in the past few years.
Best events, as they lino up after
six weeks of fall practice, arc the
weights, as usual, the hurdles, dis
tances, and high jump. Pole vault
and javelin events are so far the
scantiest.
Sam Klopstock, Jim Reynolds, A1
Hershey, Humbert Smith, Chuck
Nimmo, Phil Levy, and Ed Burrows
loom as biggest point winners. All
but the last named were among the
nation's best last spring.
Sprints
Ray Dean, Chuck Voigt, and Jim
Kneubuhl. Both Dean and Voigt
have done 9.8 at one time or an
other, but were handicapped by in
juries last year. Kneubuhl, the fast
lad from Pango-Pango, may go into
the 440.
440

Jack Weierhauser, and Paul Greene.
