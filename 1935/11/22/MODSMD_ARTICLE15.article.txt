## Foreign Minister Favors Compromise in North 
### 
TOKYO, Nov. 22 (Friday) (/P).â€” j
Sources close to the government 1
said Japanese militarists and oppos
ing civilian "leaders faced a show
down today over the North China
situation, with the life of the Cabi- !
net possibly in the balance.
The issue was expected to be de- I
bated at a Cabinet session with Koki
Hirota, Foreign Minister, loading the
civilian group and General Yoshi
yuki Kawashima, Minister of War,
representing the militarists.
Hirota, informed sources said, fa- ,
vors a compromise on the North
China issue which would allow the |
Chinese national government to re
tain a considerable degree of au
thority in the five northern prov
inces.
This plan was recommended by
Akira Ariyoshi, Ambassador to
China, who consulted with General
issimo Chiang Kai-Shek, Chinese
national government leader, in Nan
king yesterday.
(Chinese dispatches said Japanese
officers in China were impatient in
the delay.)
The proposed declaration of au
tonomy by the five provinces has
been "postponed for the time being"
in response to urgent instructions of
Chiang Kai-Shek, the Kongo (Japa
nese) News Agency reported from
Tientsin.
