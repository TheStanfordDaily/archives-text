# Copp Rides High, Feeds Pets While Chappies Vanish
## 
### 
Old Boy Coppie Chap was riding
high yesterday afternoon, for sales- j
men, who now sat around dunking
their feet in buckets of bicarbonate j
of soda, reported a complete sell-out [
at 11 o'clock.
It was a scene for great rejoicing,
and Copp was even nice to his pet i
sardines, which ho had let out of |
their cages. He gave them some |
cigars, which was very unusual but 1
considerate, so they had to get up
and sing to show off.
The Choppie Capp had removed
their tails, incidentally, because, as
he explained it., "people always bite
off the tails when they eat them any
way."
"Chappie's are ripe," hummed .
the Old Boy, as wc made for the
door. "Hey, don't forget we've saved
out a few Chappies to sell at tomor
row's game. And hey! There IS a
game tomorrow, isn't there?"
