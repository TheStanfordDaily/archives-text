1,000.000 homo troops.
The temporary reduction, it was

siege of Italy, and the desire to
send men home to the families
that need them.
The soldiers will be told to Ik?
ready to return on an instant's no

Farmers will be sent home first,
then men who are believed most
needed by their fainilirs, and then
those who have records of good con
duct during at least eight months of
service.
Many others have been virtually
instructed to be ready for a call to
