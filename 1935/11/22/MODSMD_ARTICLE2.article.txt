MOST VALUABLE PLAYER in the country was the honor a warded Bones Hamilton last year. The Indians' blocking half
specializes in clearing the way for Grayson, but he personally carried the burden in three games last year.


WHAT STANFORD'S "VOWING SOPHS" HAVE DONE
IN THREE YEARS OF VARSITY FOOTBALL:
—Vowed never to be beaten by U.S.C., and they weren't,
which meant breaking the Trojans' winning streak of 27
straight games.
—In three years they've gained nearly twice as many
yards as their opponents—7676 to 3864—over lour miles
of clicking line drives and completed passes.
—They've outscored their opponents nearly 5 to 1—438
points to 97—equal to 73 touchdowns.
—Three men—Bobby Grayson, Jim Moscrip, and Bob
Reynolds were named all-American in their junior year.
—One member—Bob Hamilton—was named the most val
uable player in the country last year.
—Nine men made either first or second all-Coast teams
last year.
—In their one conference defeat in the last two seasons
they outgained their opponents (U.C.L.A.) 4 to 1.
—Won seven games, including Big Games, in the fourth
quarter, and six by field goals.

ALL-COAST ENDS—both of
them. Monk Moscrip and
Keith Topping defend the
Stanford flanks in their last
Big Game tomorrow after
having teamed to effectively
guard both ends of the line
for three years. Moscrip has
won four games, three of
them in the last guarter, with
his deadly field-goal toe. He
was named on every all-
Coast team last year, and on
many of the all-American
selections. Topping, over
shadowed by his more fa
mous contemporary of the
opposite flank, also received
all-Coast mention last year.
It may be either a field goal
by Monk or a pass to Top
ping that settle California's
status tomorrow. Indian fans
will remember that when
Moscrip was out of the Big
Game last year Topping
turned in one of the finest
performances of his athletic
career at Stanford. Moscrip
I is in the foreground.


TWICE ALL-AMERICAN, Bobby Grayson has gained over
a mile—lB92 yards—through hard-charging defenses. Yet
he's been kept out of the easy games, Northwestern, Mon
tana, and the Olympic Club last year, and Montana this year.
In the U.C.L.A. defeat he made more yards than all the
Bruin backs combined—five yards at a crack.





FOUR INDIAN LINEMEN that will be hard to replace are
Wes Muller, center, upper left; All-American Bob Reynolds,
tackle, upper right; Woody Adams, guard, lower left; and
Larry Rouble, guard, lower right. These men play in
their last Big Game for Stanford tomorrow.


FRANKIE WILL SEE THE GAME from an auto on the rirr
of the stadium instead o( from the Stanford backfield as be
has in the last two Big Games. Alustiza is recovering fron
an pvp nnpration. He threw the oass that beat the Bears in 1933

—Three men—Bobby Grayson, Jim Moscrip, and Bob
Reynolds were named all-American in their junior year.
—One member—Bob Hamilton—was named the most val
uable player in the country last year.
—Nine men made either first or second all-Coast teams
last year.
—In their one conference defeat in the last two seasons
they outgained their opponents (U.C.L.A.) 4 to 1.
—Won seven games, including Big Games, in the fourth
quarter, and six by field goals.

ALL-COAST ENDS—both of
them. Monk Moscrip and
Keith Topping defend the
Stanford flanks in their last
Big Game tomorrow after
having teamed to effectively
guard both ends of the line
for three years. Moscrip has
won four games, three of
them in the last guarter, with
his deadly field-goal toe. He
was named on every all-
Coast team last year, and on
many of the all-American
selections. Topping, over
shadowed by his more fa
mous contemporary of the
opposite flank, also received
all-Coast mention last year.
It may be either a field goal
by Monk or a pass to Top
ping that settle California's
status tomorrow. Indian fans
will remember that when
Moscrip was out of the Big
Game last year Topping
turned in one of the finest
performances of his athletic
career at Stanford. Moscrip
I is in the foreground.


TWICE ALL-AMERICAN, Bobby Grayson has gained over
a mile—lB92 yards—through hard-charging defenses. Yet
he's been kept out of the easy games, Northwestern, Mon
tana, and the Olympic Club last year, and Montana this year.
In the U.C.L.A. defeat he made more yards than all the
Bruin backs combined—five yards at a crack.





FOUR INDIAN LINEMEN that will be hard to replace are
Wes Muller, center, upper left; All-American Bob Reynolds,
tackle, upper right; Woody Adams, guard, lower left; and
Larry Rouble, guard, lower right. These men play in
their last Big Game for Stanford tomorrow.


FRANKIE WILL SEE THE GAME from an auto on the rirr
of the stadium instead o( from the Stanford backfield as be
has in the last two Big Games. Alustiza is recovering fron
an pvp nnpration. He threw the oass that beat the Bears in 1933

MOST VALUABLE PLAYER in the country was the honor a warded Bones Hamilton last year. The Indians' blocking half
specializes in clearing the way for Grayson, but he personally carried the burden in three games last year.


WHAT STANFORD'S "VOWING SOPHS" HAVE DONE
IN THREE YEARS OF VARSITY FOOTBALL:
—Vowed never to be beaten by U.S.C., and they weren't,
which meant breaking the Trojans' winning streak of 27
straight games.
—In three years they've gained nearly twice as many
yards as their opponents—7676 to 3864—over lour miles
of clicking line drives and completed passes.
—They've outscored their opponents nearly 5 to 1—438
points to 97—equal to 73 touchdowns.

Reynolds were named all-American in their junior year.
