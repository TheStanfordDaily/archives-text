### Roger Pryor 
More than ten thousand cheering
and singing rooters circled the tra
ditional Big Game bonfire last night
as a climax to a week of rallying for
the inspired Stanford team which
will battle California tomorrow.
The rally preceding the bonfire
was also greeted with enthuiasm by
a crowd which filled the Pavilion j
to overflowing. Among the principal
speakers were Paul Speegle, famed
yell leader of 1929, and Coach Tiny
Thornhill. Winstead Weaver intro
duced a parody on "Ta-Ra-Ra-
Boom De-Ay," entitled "Give 'em
the Axe-Eay," written by Douglas
Watson. Bill Corbus, Ail-American
guard in '32 and '33, also spoke.
A song written by Addison N.
Clark, entitled "Get on the Big Red
Toboggan," was an added feature
and proved so successful that by a
unanimous vote it was decided to
have copies on hand for distribution
in Saturday's rooting section.
Encinamen Entertain
One verse was devoted to each of
the 11 men who will make up the
starting lineup tomorrow. It was j
sung to the tune of "Put on Your
Old Gray Bonnet" by a quartet of
frosh, John Turner, Charles Muel
ler, Collie Small and Johnny Wil
son, with accompaniment by Bob
Kingsley.
Co-chairmen Bob Hoover and
Bob Jones* expressed satisfaction j
with the results of their appeal for
help in the one-day bonfire, which
according to Jones was "better than |
last year." Shotguns loaded with j
salt to repel Cal attacks were found
to be unnecessary, despite several j
minor scares.

predicted Stanford would win but
stated that he has put himself in j
somewhat of a spot by announcing ,
