### 
Rooters' tickets for the Cali
fornia-Stanford game will ad
mit only to the section for
which they call. No student
holding a rooters' ticket in
Section A will be allowed in
the rooting section in DD. All
tickets will be checked as the
number of tickets sold at the
original four-day sale and the
number of seats correspond ex
actly.
The section will be heavily
policed and anyone attempting
to sit in DD without a ticket
calling for that section will be
asked to leave. If there is any
difficulty, the person involved
will be asked to leave the sta
dium. We are attempting to co
operate with the Rally Com

will not be ruined by over
crowding of the rooting section.
