# Rose Bowl Bid, Coast Crown at Stake In 41st Big Game
## Grayson 'Feels Great' "Bones" at Right Half; Team Mentally Fit 
### Gordy Frost 
California's Golden Bears, fat
with meats from recent victories,
march into Stanford's stadium to
morrow afternoon to go under the
axe-bearing arms of determined
Redskins, Indians resolved to drop
their tomahawks on Blue and Gold
necks to find out just how fierce
these invaders really are.
For it's the 41st Big Game.
And this year that traditional bat
tle of old is more than just Stan
ford vs. California. This year an
unbeaten, though relatively inex
perienced team of fighting Bears
crosses the bay to meet Stan
ford's oncc defeated, thrice threat
ened, but still undaunted Indian
varsity to decide the 1935 Pasa
dena Rose Bowl bid, and a confer
ence tie or victory.
And now. if ever, is Stanford
ready to make the settlement. For
today the Indians are in better
physical shape than they have been
since the Uclan game wrought such
havoc some weeks ago.
Bobby Grayson, as much all -
American as ever, says he's "feel
ing great." his ankle injury com
pletely forgotten. And Bones
Hamilton, wearing an especially
made mask to protect his broken
nose, will line up at his old right
half post in the starting backfield.
Mentally the Cards arc just as
well set. For three scares in as many
weeks against Washington, Santa
Clara, and U.S.C. have taken any
trace of over-confidence out of the
Indians' minds. Last week's splen
did showing of the reserves against
Montana will act as a "pusher" for
the first, line—and in case of injuries,
that dread of every Farm fan, they
will be ready to take over the reins.
California, at the bottom some,
two months ago when the season
began, has since literally driven
herself through one victory after
another. Stub Allison took a rela
tively green team and built it into
one of the finest on the coast.
Against Stanford tomorrow it will
meet it's greatest test. And this
writer believes that with Stanford's
physical and mental condition as it
is, the Boars will be forced to stop
their undefeated march.
Cal's Blower, Lutz, and company
will meet a defense tomorrow that,
will halt their rushing attack but, in
the air they may connect with the
pass that will mean the ball game.
However, with Bobby Grayson's
running and Bones, Jim CnfTis, and
Bill I'aulman blocking, Stanford
should be able to penetrate the C'al
line despite its extreme strength.
At any rate, the Card backfield
combination can be favored over
California's tentative set-up of
John Meek at quarter, Floyd
Blower at left half. Sam Chapman
at the oilier flank, and Jack How
ard at fullback. So on the ground
( the Indians have the edge.
In the air it promises to he a
somewhat different story. The Bear,
have demonstrated an aerial attack
i that behooves watching. They've

began, has since literally driven
herself through one victory after

Against Stanford tomorrow it will
meet it's greatest test. And this

their undefeated march.
Cal's Blower, Lutz, and company
will meet a defense tomorrow that,
will halt their rushing attack but, in
the air they may connect with the
pass that will mean the ball game.
However, with Bobby Grayson's
running and Bones, Jim CnfTis, and
Bill I'aulman blocking, Stanford
should be able to penetrate the C'al
line despite its extreme strength.
At any rate, the Card backfield
combination can be favored over
California's tentative set-up of
John Meek at quarter, Floyd

California's Golden Bears, fat

Redskins, Indians resolved to drop
their tomahawks on Blue and Gold
necks to find out just how fierce
these invaders really are.

And this year that traditional bat

crosses the bay to meet Stan
ford's oncc defeated, thrice threat
ened, but still undaunted Indian
varsity to decide the 1935 Pasa
dena Rose Bowl bid, and a confer

And now. if ever, is Stanford
ready to make the settlement. For
today the Indians are in better
physical shape than they have been
since the Uclan game wrought such
havoc some weeks ago.
Bobby Grayson, as much all -
American as ever, says he's "feel

pletely forgotten. And Bones
Hamilton, wearing an especially
made mask to protect his broken
nose, will line up at his old right
half post in the starting backfield.
Mentally the Cards arc just as
well set. For three scares in as many
weeks against Washington, Santa
Clara, and U.S.C. have taken any
trace of over-confidence out of the
Indians' minds. Last week's splen

Montana will act as a "pusher" for
