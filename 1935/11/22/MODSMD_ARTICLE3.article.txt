PASS-SNAGGING QUARTERBACK JOHN MEEK was on the
receiving end of the throw from Floyd Blower that broke the
Huskies. John, a sophomore first-stringer, follows his older
brother, Dave, who just finished a three-sport career on Bear
football, basketball and track teams. Below is an action shot
of Meek snatching the pass that scored the first touchdown in
the Washington game from By Haines (29) and others of the
Husky defense that proved so futile against the California
aerial circus in Berkeley two weeks ago.



RESERVE STRENGTH is California's big boast. Above, Don Fowler, ace of the Bear running
backs and substitute for Floyd Blower, romps through a wide hole in the Washington line
for a nice gain. Below, John Meek (49), a sophomore and California's first-string
guarterback, comes up to intercept a prayerful Husky pass.


CHARGING LINE: Hard-blocking Bear forwards clear a big hole for their
little speedster and left halfback, Don Fowler, in the California throwing of
Washinqton. The two Huskies on the extreme riaht are Cain and Nowonro.v-

ski, of the secondary, who eventually stopped Fowler. Every one of the
Husky linemen is effectively blocked out of the play. No. 72 is Chuck Bond
Huskv tackle, a strona candidate for all-Coast honors.



CALIFORNIA'S OPPORTUNISTS make and take the breaks.
Above, Jack Brittingham, Bear end on the questionable list lor
tomorrow's Big Game, is shown hawking By Haines' fumble in
