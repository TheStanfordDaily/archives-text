# Board Revises Traffic System For Big Game
## 
### 
Traffic regulations for this year's
Pig Game parking have been al
tered by B.A.C. officials to cor
rect several mistakes made at past
games.
At the California-Stanford grid
battle two years ago, XO motor
cycle officers were stationed about
the stadium directing traffic. It
was found by the B.A.C. that
there was not enough work for
nil, and the majority came to see
the game.
Tomorrow's game will have only
20 state officers, but there will
also be 450 student police officials
to aid in parking lots and at the
turnstile posts.
The stadium's parking space has
enough room for 30,000 automo
biles, and several campus roads
including the one from the B.A.C.
building to the stadium will be
blocked oil' as byways for pedes
trians and for the football players
from the locker room to the howl.
