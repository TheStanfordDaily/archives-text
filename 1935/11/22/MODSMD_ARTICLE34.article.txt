# Quad Lensmen Snap Big Game
## 
### 
A.s enthusiastic Stanfordites mov
ed down the Row last night, storm
ed the Pavilion to cheer Indian
gridders, watched the Big Game i
bonfire blaze, Quad camera men
were not idle. With their "candid l
cameras" Editor Don Hanson's pho- ,
tography staff caught the thrill and
glamour of the entire event. From
scores of shots taken last night, the i
best will be selected to "live for
ever" in the 193G Quad.
All week-end will see the pho
tographers' "rein of terror." Tonight j
at the Gaieties, back-stage will they
be, snapping unnoticed the princi
pals of the show. Tomorrow down on
the gridiron Don Gibson will catch
Indians and Bears fighting for the
Rose Bowl with his graflex.
To make sure no major play will
be missed, Ernie Hartmann from the
top of the stadium will play his
telephoto-lensed Leica on the field of !
action. From these football pictures
will spring an all-inclusive Big
, Game section in the 1936 yearbook,
1 Hanson said.
To compete the picture record of :
the biggest Big Game week-end in ;
Farm history, Quad's cameramen i
will hie themselves to the Palace i
Hotel tomorrow night for the alumni 1
; dinner. They'll be on the look-out
for "big shots."
