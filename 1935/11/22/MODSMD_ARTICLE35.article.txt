# Plans Made To Dedicate. New Theater
## Cutler Slated To Speak At Short Ceremony 
### 
Preliminary plans for the corner- j
stone-laying ceremony of the new j
Memorial Hall are being prepared by
the University Public Exercises i
Committee and the Theater Com
mittee. According to a tentative out- !
line of the program, Leland Cutler, 1
president of the Board of Trustees, j
will be asked to make one of ihe j
principal speeches of the day.
Over two weeks of steam shovel i
excavation have resulted in a large i
gaping hole which more than one j
student has mistaken for Thursday |
night's bonlire. But by the begin- j
ning of February, according to con- j
struction chief George Wagner, j
.steel framework will be in place and j
concrete foundations poured. The j
dedication will probably take place !
in the middle of February.
Members of the committee, Presi- I
dent Wally Brooke, Annalee Whit- {
more, A1 Hyman, Phil Brown, and
Student Manager Bob Gros, pre
dict that the ceremony will be
brief, and no seating facilities can
be provided. An amplifying system j
will be installed to make talks au- j
ciible if the University equipment j
proves inadequate. Copies of The j
Daily containing theater articles,
plans of the structure, and other doc
uments will be sealed inside the
marble block.
The whole building will measure
2GO by 219 feet, and will be roughly
T-shaped. Facilities include a large
auditorium seating 1550 a
little theater, classrooms, and work
shops. Total cost of the structure
will reach approximately $583,000, to
be paid over a period of 20 years.
Public speaking classes, some of
which meet in Woodpecker Lodge,
will all move to up-to-date class- j
rooms next year. All dramatic j
classes will also be held in the j
Memorial Hall.
