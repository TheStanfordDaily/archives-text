# Cal Raiders Bum C' On Campus Grass
## 
### 
Last night while the campus slept,
Bear jokesters payed Stanford a
visit in the form of a large "C" in
front of Jordan Hall (the Physics
Building). The "C" was made by
pouring gasoline on the grass in the
desired shape and then lighting it.
The one which the avid U.C. raiders
made last night—while a heavy rain
was falling—was fully 10 yards in
length.
It would seem that the Cal rooters
did the Indians the honor of com
ing down here because of a desire
to revenge the coat of lovely red
paint that some Indian roughs —
probably the brave but hen-pecked
Class of '39—gave to the huge yel
low "C" up on "Tightwad Hill" at 4
o'clock on Wednesday morning.
