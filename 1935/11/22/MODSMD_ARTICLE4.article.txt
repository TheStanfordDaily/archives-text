# Recent Gridiron Shots of Indian and Golden Bear Elevens

### 

BONES HAMILTON STARTED the scor
ing in last year's Big Game, just as the
Indian halfback did in last week's Stan
ford-Montana game. Bones is shown at
the left just after he caught Ray Todd's
pass in the first guarter. He will be in
the Big Game assigned to the detail of
paving the way for Bobby Grayson's
ramblings. Although he has been on
the injured list during much of the pres
ent season, Hamilton will be a running
as well as a blocking threat tomorrow.
This pass set Stanford on her way to a
32-0 rout last Saturday in the game that
marked Bones' return to the line-up
after a month's lay-off.

A STANFORD FIELD DAY may develop
tomorrow with Bones Hamilton doing
some of his customary blocking for
Bobby Grayson and little Jimmy Coffis.
The latter is shown at right tearing
through a broken field of Southern Cali
fornians for a sizeable chunk of yard
age. In the Trojan game, which Stan
ford won with a last-minute field goal,
Coffis proved himself a brilliant open
field runner, and he may pile up an
impressive bit of yardage against the
Bears with Hamilton in the game to
break him through to the secondary.
Coffis will start at safety, where he
will handle California kicks tomorrow.

THAT THE BEARS WON'T get far on
running plays in this year's Big Game is
indicated in this picture (right) of the
Stanford-Santa Clara game, which Stan
ford recently won 9 to 6. Don De Rosa,
Bronco ace, is shown carrying the ball
around end behind interference from
Dick Bassi (16), sensational Santa Clara
guard. Bobby Grayson, Stanford's all-
American fullback, is coming in to
smear De Rosa for a loss, after Indian
ends had taken out most of the interfer
ence. Nr . 33 is Wes Muller.


STANFORD'S MOST FA
MOUS TOE, attached to the
leg of Monk Moscrip, is here
shown hoisting the ball be
tween the uprights at Kezar
in the 1934 TJ.S.F. encounter,
to beat the Dons, 3-0. Hold
ing the ball for the aggres
sive end is Frank Alustiza,
who will be sorely missed in
the Card backfield tomorrow.
Snapped hard at work, block
ing out one of the Dons, is
Bones Hamilton (29), who re
turns to his old right half
position to block for Bobby
Grayson tomorrow.


JIMMY COFFIS, caught in
the act of hurdling Flash Fa
laschi, Bronc defensive full,
and picking out a soft spot
on which to land. He is very
seriously considering the
broad shoulders of Guard
Woody Adams. At left is
Card Full Bill Paulman, en
joying a brief blow atop
Horse Reynolds, -ifter having
fulfilled his blocking assign
ine-in the game won by the
Cdids, 9 to 6, in the stadium
here three weeks ago. Coffis,
a San Francisco high school
product and frosh star last
year, moved in at left half in
the regular backfield when
Frankie Alustiza was injured
early in the season.


IT WAS A FLUKE that
gave California her 6-0
victory over Santa Clara,
many fans say. However,
the Bears did bottle up the
potent Bronco running at
tack. Here's one of the few
times Santa Clara's Don
De Rosa (12) succeeded in
penetrating the Cal de
fense. In the foreground
Nello (Flash) Falaschi is
shutting California's Floyd
Blower out of the play.

the regular backfield when
Frankie Alustiza was injured
early in the season.


IT WAS A FLUKE that
gave California her 6-0
victory over Santa Clara,
many fans say. However,
the Bears did bottle up the
potent Bronco running at
tack. Here's one of the few
times Santa Clara's Don
De Rosa (12) succeeded in
penetrating the Cal de
fense. In the foreground
Nello (Flash) Falaschi is
shutting California's Floyd
Blower out of the play.



BONES HAMILTON STARTED the scor
ing in last year's Big Game, just as the
Indian halfback did in last week's Stan
ford-Montana game. Bones is shown at
the left just after he caught Ray Todd's
pass in the first guarter. He will be in
the Big Game assigned to the detail of
paving the way for Bobby Grayson's
ramblings. Although he has been on
the injured list during much of the pres
ent season, Hamilton will be a running
as well as a blocking threat tomorrow.
This pass set Stanford on her way to a
32-0 rout last Saturday in the game that
marked Bones' return to the line-up
after a month's lay-off.

A STANFORD FIELD DAY may develop
tomorrow with Bones Hamilton doing
some of his customary blocking for
Bobby Grayson and little Jimmy Coffis.
The latter is shown at right tearing
through a broken field of Southern Cali
fornians for a sizeable chunk of yard
age. In the Trojan game, which Stan
ford won with a last-minute field goal,
Coffis proved himself a brilliant open
field runner, and he may pile up an
impressive bit of yardage against the
Bears with Hamilton in the game to
break him through to the secondary.
Coffis will start at safety, where he
will handle California kicks tomorrow.

THAT THE BEARS WON'T get far on
running plays in this year's Big Game is
indicated in this picture (right) of the
Stanford-Santa Clara game, which Stan
ford recently won 9 to 6. Don De Rosa,
Bronco ace, is shown carrying the ball
around end behind interference from
Dick Bassi (16), sensational Santa Clara
guard. Bobby Grayson, Stanford's all-
American fullback, is coming in to
smear De Rosa for a loss, after Indian
ends had taken out most of the interfer
ence. Nr . 33 is Wes Muller.


STANFORD'S MOST FA
MOUS TOE, attached to the
leg of Monk Moscrip, is here
shown hoisting the ball be
tween the uprights at Kezar
in the 1934 TJ.S.F. encounter,
to beat the Dons, 3-0. Hold
ing the ball for the aggres
sive end is Frank Alustiza,
who will be sorely missed in
the Card backfield tomorrow.
Snapped hard at work, block
ing out one of the Dons, is
Bones Hamilton (29), who re
turns to his old right half
position to block for Bobby
Grayson tomorrow.


JIMMY COFFIS, caught in
the act of hurdling Flash Fa
laschi, Bronc defensive full,
and picking out a soft spot
on which to land. He is very
seriously considering the
broad shoulders of Guard
Woody Adams. At left is
Card Full Bill Paulman, en
joying a brief blow atop
Horse Reynolds, -ifter having
fulfilled his blocking assign
ine-in the game won by the
Cdids, 9 to 6, in the stadium
here three weeks ago. Coffis,
a San Francisco high school
product and frosh star last
year, moved in at left half in
the regular backfield when
