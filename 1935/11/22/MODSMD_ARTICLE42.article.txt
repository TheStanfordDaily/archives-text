# Indian Militia Plays Nurse To Bear Team
## 
### 
California is going to call
out the army in an effort to
win the Big Game.
And if they could gel a bat
tleship up to the Stanford
Stadium they'd probably use
the Nuvy, too.
For today on the greensward
of the local stadium the laddies
from the institution across the
bay will gambol and cavort
protected by the menacing sa
bers, swords, cannons, and can
non fodder of Stanford's own
R.O.T.C.
For you see the laddies who
call themselves "Bears" cannot
.gambol unless in absolute se
cret. And as "Father Stub" is
very, very much afraid of In
dians, the R.O.T.C. has been
called out in an effort to pro
tect his laddi 'bucks from some
redskin with malicious desires
and vandalistic intent.
So once again the familiar
"Who Goes There" will ring out
in the clear afternoon air, to
the clink of saber and snort of
horse, while far below the sta
dium rim the fearing Bears of
Berkeley wiil gambol in ecs
tasy, knowing that no Indian
can crack that formidable line
of the R.O.T.C.
