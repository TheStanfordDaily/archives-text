## 
### ART STOKES 
Tomorrow morning at 6 o'clock, <
"middle of the night" to most stu
dents, the first contingent of the
B.A.C.'s Big Game workers will re
port for duty.
From lhat hour on. more and
more Stanford, junior college, and
high school students will report un
til at game time l.") 00 workers will
be assisting the 1)0,000 spectators.
To handle the 25,000 autonio- j
biles which will jam Peninsula ,
highways and pour onto the cam
pus, more than 100 men, mostly
Stanford students, will he used.
'J lie crew will include traffic di
re* tors. captains, and barrier
guards.
The coveted ushers' jobs—inside
the stadium where there will be a
chance to see the game—will be
filled mostly by high school and
jaysee students, but among the 700
in the crew of ushers, stair crews,
and inside guards will be a few
Stanfordites.
The rest of the huge force is com
posed chiefly ol concessions work
ers, program salesmen, and "peanut
butchers."
Then, lor "extraordinary" serv
ices, just to help along the hordes,
Jake Irwin, manager of the B.A.C.
ticket department, says a number of
special qrews will be provided.
There will be lost ticket crews,
where those who want in can ex
plain that they must have lost
their ducats as they got out of the
car; lost and found crews, to hunt
coats, and cars, and babies; am
bulance crews; tow - car crews;
crcws to help people -get in the
stadium, others to help them out;
wheelchair-pushers, and first-aid
crews.
To the hungry who fail to supply
their own food, the concessionaires
will sell sandwiches, pop, peanuts,
says Irwin, "are hard on people's

STOKES

stomachs."
Except for the ushers, most of
the workers will miss the game. <
Such crews as those handling traf
fic will work until released, which i
may be ut the half or later; others
will work in shifts, while barrier <
crews will work straight through I
until the game ends.
Irwin says preparations have been 1
going on for more than six months; 1
in fact, plans for improvements 1
started at the last Big Game. Print- : i
ing of tickets, applications, signs, l
maps, and programs has beon done
in a volume that "no one would be- '
lieve if they were told."
