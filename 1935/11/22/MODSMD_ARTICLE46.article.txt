PARIS. Nov. 21 (/P). — Premier";
Mussolini of Italy today was de- |
scribed by French ollicials as indif- j
lerent to any Franco-British peace 1
suggestions until Marshal Pietro Ba
doglio, new commander-in-chief of 1
Italian forces in Africa, "had a ,
chance to win a few battles."
This skepticism was reflected in j
other authoritative quarters as ,
Franco - British negotiations began J
in Quai d'Orsay. Maurice Peterson, j
Ethiopian expert of the British For- i
eign Office, and Maurice St. Quen- |
tin, Africa expert for the French j
government, arranged a conference !
toward peace proposals.
But these conversations, informed j
circles agreed, were "just to keep i
the door open and show the world \
France and Britain are fulfilling ;
their obligations" to the League of
Nations to seek peace.
Previously sources close to Pre
mier Laval took hope that the ar
rival ol Peterson made the chances
for peace look less precarious.
