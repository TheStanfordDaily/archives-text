## Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily Goal Posts Cost $57,975 a Pair Forty Years of Tradition and History Packed Into One Little Football Game 
### 
It's Big Game time againâ€”with its glamor [
and spirit, with two nervous yet inspired teams I
lighting for whatever certain type of suprem
acy football is designed to measure, with old
grads bringing hack to the campus stories of
"how it used to he," with civilians of Stanford
and California loudly boasting before the
game, madly cheering during the game, and
cither celebrating or personally heartbroken
after the game.
All of these are characteristic of Big Game
day, the year's most gala occasion in the vicin
ity of Palo Alto or Berkeley, depending on the
scheduled site of festivities.
Nearly 90,000 people, some of them stu- ,
dents, some alumni, some interested fans, and !
some uninterested spectators who come to get j
their glamor second hand, have paid nearly j
$300,000 into the colVcrs of the Stanford and |
California athletic departments.
From the logic standpoint, the whole thing
would seem horribly overdone, all out of pro
portion. Big Game, however, goes deeper
than that. In il is wrapped up 41 years of
tradition, 41 years of accumulated rivalry, ]
for the most part friendly, between the two I
"big" schools of Western United Stales.
The business of Big Game fluctuates only

! slightly throughout the years ;is one team,
! then the other, claims gridiron supremacy. It
reaches its peak in a year such as this when
the two are evenly matched, but either the
Indian or the Bear could be a "100-to-l shot"
without materially altering the tradition, his
tory, and glamor involved.
Aside from being a spectacle of tradition
and color, Big Game annually throws a chal
lenge at the undergraduates of the opposing
colleges. II demands a show of unparalleled
spirit, win or lose. It further demands a show
of sportsmanship; this law, although occasion
| ally violated by one side or the other, has come
, to be an inalienable portion of the Big Game
j code.
For two short hours Stanford and California
I collectively forget their problems and individ
| ual troubles and worry more about the success
j of Monk Moserip's field goal than approach
ing finals, more about the accuracy of Floyd
Blower's pass than next month's rent.
And another Big Game adds itself to the
: long list that has made up a tradition that goes
; inexplainably deep into every Stanford or
I California mail's feeling, a tradition of fool
ball rivalry equalled only by Vale and Har
vard, surpassed by none.
