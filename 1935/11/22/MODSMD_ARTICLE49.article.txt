# Big Game Gaieties Caper Before Capacity Crowd
## 
### 
Appeal of the Big Game Gaieties does not
need expression in words. The sell-out three
days in advance of presentation attests to the
place this student-written, student-acted —and
his year, student-directed —revue has come to
hold.
Yearly the Gaieties, livelier, timelier, and
employing a larger east than any of its fellow
productions pays the freight for the rest of
Stanford's drama schedule.
No matter how well done, the usual three
act play fails to I ill the Farm's antiquated
Assembly 1 hill; but the Gaieties seldom misses.
Capacity throngs usually file out well pleased
with student wit, and with student songs in
their ears.
Advance predictions, familiarly enough, de
clare the current edition will be ''as good as,
or better than" any of its forerunners.
Sentimental old-timers will probably never
see another Gaieties in the old Assembly Hall
if they fail to obtain seats for tonight. Next
year, barring mishap, Gaieties will have
moved with all other Stanford dramatics—
to the new Memorial Hall.
That structure, although ultra-modern,
comfortable, and well planned will seat about
I win hundred less than the present hull. The
time is probably not far away when increasing
enrolment and sustained interest will neces
sitate a two-night stand for the Gaieties.
