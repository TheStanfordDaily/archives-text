Pacific Coast Conference title with
his teams, has twice placed teams
in the Rose Bowl, and threatens to
repeat both performances for the
third successive time.
Ernie Nevers, former Indian full
back and declared to be "one of Ihe
greatest players of all time," said of
his contract: "I'm very pleased.
Stanford is a great institution and I
love being here." Nevers came back

ceed Warner.

former all-American end who
spends his time turning out all-
Amcrican and all-Coast ends, said:

lows." Lawson was one of the stars
in Stanford's famous comeback in
the Big Game of 1924 when the In
dians tame from behind to tic the
Dears 20-20.

Ernie Nevers, former Indian full
back and declared to be "one of Ihe
greatest players of all time," said of
his contract: "I'm very pleased.
Stanford is a great institution and I
love being here." Nevers came back
to Stanford as assistant to Thornhill
when the latter was named to suc
ceed Warner.
Jim Lawson, end coach, and
former all-American end who
spends his time turning out all-
Amcrican and all-Coast ends, said:
"I'm glad to be back for another
year and I enjoy working with Tiny
and Ernie and the rest of the fel
lows." Lawson was one of the stars
in Stanford's famous comeback in
the Big Game of 1924 when the In
dians tame from behind to tic the
Dears 20-20.
Claude E. "Tiny" Thornhill will
guide the destiny of Stanford's Big

ning April 1, 1936, was announced '

pointment Thornhill said: "I'm
tickled to death that the trustees
saw fit to renew my contract and
at the same time granted me the
privilege of keeping my two fine
assistants, Ernie Nevers and Jim
Lawson."
Thornhill, only in his third year j
as head coach of Stanford Univer- \
sity, is entering his 15th year as a J
member of the Indian coaching i
staff. "Tiny" was assistant to "Pop" \
Warner for eleven years before be- j
ing elevated to the position he now j
holds.
An all-Amcrican tackle at Pitts- \
burgh in 1916 under the tutelage of
Warner, later coach at Centre Col- i
lege, and his 15 years here at Stan
ford have all gone to make Thorn
hill one of the most noted and ad
j.iired coaches of the day.
In three years as the Indian
mentor "Tiny" has twice won the
Pacific Coast Conference title with
his teams, has twice placed teams
in the Rose Bowl, and threatens to
repeat both performances for the
third successive time.
