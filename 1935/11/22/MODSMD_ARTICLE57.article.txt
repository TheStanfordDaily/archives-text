# "TWO AT A TIME"
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir: 1
I was much surprised to find that J
"Two Fainting Females" had sum- I
moned enough artificial courage to
I answer my criticism of their partici- i
, pation in card stunts.
May I slightly alter their sugges
; tion for a female-proof box so that j
I the proposed box will enclose the I
. entire female rooting section. This i
; will protect others as well as my- I
I self from that jangle of female J
| voices which occurs at exciting parts
i of the game.
As to my virile strength, I am j
; willing to prove this point in actual
j combat with the hysterical young
I meddlers, with the Daily editor as
referee. I'll fight them two at a
; time or in single combat, with no
j smelling salts allowed.
Finally, it wouldn't surprise me ;
: at all if some gentleman should ask
: my assistance in removing from the
! stadium this very pair of fainting
i females who write so boldly in a j
j cloistered study room, after they
j have collapsed under pressure dur-
J ing the card stunts.
Sincerely,
A Rough Who Has Gone j
Leave me out of these personal
j conflicts.—Ed.
