# UPPER CLASS KNOWS HOW

The Editor. Sir:
... I am not trying to strike a
| "complaining" note, as Frosh num
ber "two" intimates; what I am try
ing to do is to see if there isn't
some way that a plan could be
worked out so the frosh in the fu
ture would know something about
i the candidates running in the fresh
man election.
Certainly I read the Daily, but I :
j noticed the name of the frosh wa- |
| ter-polo captain more than I did
I that of Fuller or Florence Brown.
; You also would get your name in
' the paper for murdering your aunt,
; but that isn't any sign that you
| would make a good class president.
Perhaps the Assembly method.
| with a presentation of the candi
dates, would be the thing. We have
all seen and heard of the virtues of
I the upper division officers by this
| method, and why couldn't this be
done for the lower division before
election time?
