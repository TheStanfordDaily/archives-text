"TOBACCO ROAD," which has
its 850 th performance tomorrow
night, will soon bo retitled "Abie's
Irish Rose."
SOB STORY: Three or four years
ago, Smith Rallcw led one of the
country's best dance orchestras. It
was not one of the most famous,
but "Smith Ballew and his Piping
Rock Orchestra" were a nightly fea
ture on the Columbia Broadcasting
system, and their Columbia record
ing of "Time on My Hands" still
stands as the smoothest ever made.
Today, Smith Ballew and a vastly
inferior band play unobtrusively in
L.A.'s Cafe de Paris, just another
junk band. You'd pass it by on
your radio dial. Where once were
smooth arrangements and synco
pated beauty there are now only
sour notes and ragged playing.
Nostalgia grips us.
