## Bears Are Rated Favorites To Represent Coast In Pasadena East's Team Unchosen Indians Need Big Game Victory Tomorrow 
### Warren Breed 
Down to its cradle on the clouded
western horizon like a splotch of
red-molten gold, sings the 1935 foot
ball sun.
Done is all the preliminary pid
dling about—the fearing C.O.P. and
the clearing of the Montana hur
dle and the inevitable season's in
juries and the numerous scoops and
rumored fiascos. Tomorrow, or
mayhap a mite later, there is a
Coast Conference champion to be
crowned, and Rose Bowl teams to
decide.
Just who is going to play in
the New Year's Pasadena round
up is about as definite as news
from the Ethiopian front.
In the West it's Stanford or Cali
fornia.
In the East it's eenie-meenie,
minie, or moc.
In the West if California beats
Stanford tomorrow the Bears are
practically ensconced in the Hunt
ington Hotel already. If Stanford
wins, Cal may still go, for U.C.L.A.
annihilated the Cards 7-6 five weeks
ago, and besides, Stanford won and
lost record in Rose Bowl play since
January 1, 1934, is not so hot.
But if Thornhill's men cop 17-7,
as John Drofnats avers, Hugh C.
Willett and his committee should
nod Farm ward. A Card victory
must ling the clarion note of the
absolutely decisive.
In the East we have six undefeat
( ds-and-untieds—Princeton, Minne
sota, Dartmouth, Southern Meth
odist. Texas Christian, and N.Y.U.
But all is not so hunky-dooly on
the East front, either.
Princeton won't, go — charging
commercialism in the Tourney of
Roses.
Minnesota can't go—under their
Big Ten ruling.
Dartmouth, as well, has been fling
ing about caustic notes about what
they would do to a Rose Bowl bid
if they got it.
Southern Methodist, so they say,
is not far enough east to repre
sent the East. But it is pretty far
East, and they have 145-pound
Bobby Wilson and Harry Shu
ford. potential all-Americans, and
a flossy pass offense, and that
spine-chilling swing band, so may
he the Mustangs may get the hid
to the land of sunshine and (low
ers, of ten-cent milkshakes and
five-cent burlesques. They would
put on a good show.
Texas Christian is not so well
known, but has beaten the strong
Rice Owls and other top-notch,
teams on its schedule.
N.Y.U. is no powerhouse, and be
sides is no favorite over Fordham
in a Thanksgiving Day game.
Such arc the six unbeaten east
ern schools, with Dartmouth (in the
event that they upset Princeton to
morrow) and S.M.U. as perhaps the
better bets.
But the team that gets the West
hid (Bears or Cards) has the op
tion of choosing any opponent it
wants—unbeaten oi not.
Prominent among these outsiders
are Notre Dame, Temple, North
Carolina, and Yale. All have been
beaten, but by one of the big teams,
and all are worthy of further look
ing into as Rose Bowl choices.

ers, of ten-cent milkshakes and
five-cent burlesques. They would
put on a good show.
Texas Christian is not so well
known, but has beaten the strong
Rice Owls and other top-notch,
teams on its schedule.
N.Y.U. is no powerhouse, and be
sides is no favorite over Fordham
in a Thanksgiving Day game.
Such arc the six unbeaten east
ern schools, with Dartmouth (in the
event that they upset Princeton to
morrow) and S.M.U. as perhaps the
better bets.
But the team that gets the West
hid (Bears or Cards) has the op
tion of choosing any opponent it
wants—unbeaten oi not.
Prominent among these outsiders
are Notre Dame, Temple, North
Carolina, and Yale. All have been
beaten, but by one of the big teams,
and all are worthy of further look
ing into as Rose Bowl choices.
Down to its cradle on the clouded
western horizon like a splotch of
red-molten gold, sings the 1935 foot
ball sun.
Done is all the preliminary pid
dling about—the fearing C.O.P. and
the clearing of the Montana hur
dle and the inevitable season's in
juries and the numerous scoops and
rumored fiascos. Tomorrow, or
mayhap a mite later, there is a
Coast Conference champion to be
crowned, and Rose Bowl teams to
decide.
Just who is going to play in
the New Year's Pasadena round
up is about as definite as news
from the Ethiopian front.
In the West it's Stanford or Cali
fornia.
In the East it's eenie-meenie,
minie, or moc.
In the West if California beats
Stanford tomorrow the Bears are
practically ensconced in the Hunt
ington Hotel already. If Stanford
wins, Cal may still go, for U.C.L.A.
annihilated the Cards 7-6 five weeks
ago, and besides, Stanford won and
lost record in Rose Bowl play since
January 1, 1934, is not so hot.
But if Thornhill's men cop 17-7,
as John Drofnats avers, Hugh C.
Willett and his committee should
nod Farm ward. A Card victory
must ling the clarion note of the
absolutely decisive.
In the East we have six undefeat
( ds-and-untieds—Princeton, Minne
sota, Dartmouth, Southern Meth
odist. Texas Christian, and N.Y.U.
But all is not so hunky-dooly on
the East front, either.
Princeton won't, go — charging
commercialism in the Tourney of
Roses.
Minnesota can't go—under their
Big Ten ruling.
Dartmouth, as well, has been fling
ing about caustic notes about what
they would do to a Rose Bowl bid
if they got it.
Southern Methodist, so they say,
is not far enough east to repre
sent the East. But it is pretty far
East, and they have 145-pound
Bobby Wilson and Harry Shu
ford. potential all-Americans, and
a flossy pass offense, and that
spine-chilling swing band, so may
he the Mustangs may get the hid
to the land of sunshine and (low
