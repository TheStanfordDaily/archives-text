# The
						Axe, Heirloom and Symbol, At Stake in Tomorrow's Game
## 
### Phil Klauber 
One good reason for the anti-
Stanford portion of an 88,000 crowd
going to Ihe Stanford Stadium to
morrow is ihe possibility of witness
ing the first occasion of a tradition
desfined to become prominent in Big
Game history.
The Stanford Axe MAY change
hands tomorrow afternoon, and if
it should, although the hand
changing is not an innovation, it
would he the first calm and above
hoard transfer in history.
It has been said that in the early
days of Stanford's existence an en
terprising student found an old
woodsman's axe, of a 16-inch blade
seldom seen nowadays, in a corner
of what is the present Corp Yard.
The axe was polished up and
painted, and thereafter became a
symbol of Stanford, representing
strength and determination. Patri
otic students drew pictures of it in
their textbooks, and it was brought
out and brandished at torchlight ral
lies before crucial athletic contests.
The customary procedure was
to sharpen it up each week and
carve up an effigy of California,
the shreds of sawdust and canvas
Chen to he thrown atop a forerun
ner of our present bonfire.

! In April 1899, before the final game
j of a baseball series with California,
the Axe was put through its paces
!at a spirited rally. Next day after
, the game in San Francisco, which
Stanford lost, 9-7, a band of Cali
j fornians attacked the four Stanford
j men who were to bring the Axe back
| to the campus, grabbed the Axe and
! took it over to Berkeley.
Then came a thirty-year period
during which the Axe was not
mentioned on this side of the bay;
numerous attempts hy Stanford to
regain it failed, and the Berkclcy
ites brought it out of its vault at
their yearly Axe rally.
Time passed, the Wonder Teams
left, to give way to a long Cardinal
supremacy at the Big Game, and the
Big Meet grew into what was called
a practice session for the Stanford
track team, but always U.C. had one
crow left—they had the Axe.
Finally on April 15, 19,'>0, a band
of Sequoia men, afterward termed
, "The Immortal Twenty-One," se
cretly laid plans for a raid on the
Berkeley Axe Rally.
Disguised as cameramen and
California frosh. the Twenty-One
gathered about the entrance of
the bank where the Axe was to
be returned after the rally. As
the California guardian stepped

from the armored car to the side
walk, an overdose of flashlight
powder was fired, a homemade
tear bomb thrown, and four Stan
ford huskies jumped for the bear
er of the Axe.
Quickly it was grasped from him,
deftly passed through four hands to
a waiting auto, and within 50 min
utes four of the band were racing up
Palm Drive.
A near frenzy hit both campi
when the news v/as out—California
organized several rescue parties, and
nightly missions were frequent to
the local campus during the next
week.
At Stanford, rallies, jolly-lips,
banquets, speeches, extras were
the order. Before a week was over
Axe stickers had been printed,
the Axe yell rclearncd. and the
Immortal Twenty-One were given
geld Axe charms and Block "S"
cards.
Later, in order to give the Axe a
status whereby it might be shown
in daylight without danger of a
riot, it was made into a Big Game
trophy, and since has rested in its
glass case in the Ceilar.
A Cardinal committee of Jim
Ludlam, C.lin Myers, Gib Holloway,
and Don Clark will bring the Axe
