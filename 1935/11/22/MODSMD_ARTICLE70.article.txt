# Jack Brittingham Out of Big Game
## 
### 
Jack Brittingham, California right
end, tried out his bad knee at prac
tice yesterday and found it still
weak. Doctors decided that he shall
not play against Stanford tomorrow.
Though the condition of the leg
was not considered extremely seri
ous. it was thought best to run no
risk of permanent â€¢ disability by
playing the star end in the Big
Game.
