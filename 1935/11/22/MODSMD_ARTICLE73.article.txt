# Elaborate Card Stunts Planned
## Complicated Images To Be Pictured by Rooters 
### 
The most elaborate card stunts
over attempted by the Stanford root
ing section will bo featured in to
morrow's game. Including the hat
stunt, which shows a red "S"' on a
white background, there will be ten
stunts, three of which have two or
more parts.
Probably the most complicated
and potentially effective of these
begin with a golden "C" on a blue
background. Then the blue will
turn to white, after which the
gold cards of the "C" and some of
the white background cards will
be rolled to finish the stunt as a
red "S" on white.
Berkeley's Campanile furnishes
the theme for another, while a life
like picture labeled "Tiny" has been
conceived for one of the half-time
attractions.
One which should bring a roar of
approval from the opposing rooting
section is a plaque saying "Good
luck Stub," while another, over
which Cal enthusiasm is doubtful,
depicts a huge, red-shirted gridiron
warrior dragging a thoroughly sub
missive bear.
As a tribute to the Indian grid
dcr who has spent several weeks
in the hospital due to a football
mishap, a stunt will consist of
"Frank" superimposed on the fig
ures "21." Ahisti/a's number.
Rally Committee Head Phil Cogli
lan wished to stress the fact that
men rooters must wear white shirts
and their rooter's caps, while white
blouses are required for Stanford
women. A seat in the regular root
ing section will be denied students
not conforming to these regulations.
