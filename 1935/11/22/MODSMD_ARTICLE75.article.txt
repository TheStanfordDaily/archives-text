# Eastern Teams In Week-End Football Wars
## Eastern Bowl Candidates Vie for Pasadena Bid 
### 
While Stanford's Red and Califor
nia's Blue and Gold are fighting it
out here Saturday, other games of
classic interest and contemporary
importance will be fought out on
other sods of the nation's gridiron.
Most crucial in the East is the
Princeton-Dartmouth tilt; most his
torically colorful, the Yale-Harvard
festival at Cambridge.
In the former game much Rose
Bowl interest centers. Princeton,
the logical Eastern candidate, has
flatly refused to accept; Dart
mouth, one of the other unde
feated, is somewhat of a good
choice—that is, if they can upset
the Tigers Saturday.
In the latter, there is not much
but sentimental interest. Both the
Yales and the Harvards have been
defeated, so there is no great mo
ment attached to the game. Yale, a
fighting loser to Princeton, is the
heavy favorite.
Southern California travels to
the Middle West to run up against
the Notre Dame South Benders.
The Jones boys, boasters of a not
too happy season, face in the
Ramblers an aggregation that
fights to the last ditch—and lias
done it in more than one game in
the past month.
Oregon goes to Seattle for its Big
Game of the season, against Wash
ington. Oregon, an outfit with but
little offensive punch, i.s given
naught but a prayer at the ham
like hands of the big Husky bunch.
The other main Coast tussle sees
Ucla, still Keyless but strong, fa
vored over the Loyola eleven that
hrs been handicapped by a tough
schedule.
Three of the other undefeated
teams play as follows: Minnesota-
Wisconsin; Texas Christian-Rice;
Southern Methodist-Baylor. N.Y.I*,
remains idle (ill Thanksgiving
Day, when she meets the strong
Fordham Rams.
Other big games Saturday: lowa
State-Kar lsas; Purdue-Indiana; Vil
lanova-Temple; Chicago - Illinois;
Centenary-Mississippi.
