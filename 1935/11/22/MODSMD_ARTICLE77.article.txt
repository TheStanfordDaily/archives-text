# Passes May Prove Margin of Victory
## Tight Defenses May Force Gal, Indians into Air Stanford's First String Has Man-for-Man Edge To Counteract Reserve Strength of Bears; Monk's Toe Is Scoring Threat 
### HERB DIAMOND 
When an irresistible force meets an immovable objcct, then what?
That question might very well be answered tomorrow afternoon on
the Stadium turf when a pair of unusually capable football teams—each
boasting an impenetrable forward wall, each employing the same general
type of play— meet head-on. The gargantuan collision is set for two o'clock,
but exactly what will be happening several minutes after two o'clock is
indeed a matter for conjecture.
♦ Pro-game indications forecast that

at some time or another that irre
sistible force, known as the Stanford
grid aggregation, and that immov
able object, described as the Cali
fornia football team, will take to the
air when other alternatives seem in
effective.

at Berkeley during Big Game week.

Should Jupiter Pluvius shove a

exactly impossible, neither ball club
will thereby gain an advantage.
Neither, strictly speaking, can be

field though the opposing line would
be an equally tough proposition for
both parties concerned.
Both Tiny Thornhill and Stub
Allison have intimated that vic
tory for either outfit might come
via the air. In addition to passing,
forward and lateral, that lets in
plain and fancy field goaling. A
Stanford advantage is seen in the
toe of one Mr. Monk Moscrip, who
has already added no less than 15
points to the Redskins' credit iliis
season. Monk also possesses fin
gers that have a knack for hauling
down passes.
However, it is generally rumored
on the Berkeley campus that left end
Henry Sparks is no mean booter
himself. And he's missed very few
passes this season. It is California's
Sparks, then, who seems most com
parable to Moscrip when it comes
to kicking and pass-snagging.
Perhaps (he all-important ques
tion that looms for tomorrow's en
counter is this: Can California stop
Bobby Grayson? Gentlemen who
should know have labeled Bobby
the greatest ball carrier in the busi
ness, but there are several tough in
dividuals from Berkeley who will
argue that point. Among them are
such strong-armed fellows as Lutz,
Nordstrom, Anderson, and Tenney
in the Bear line. These gridstevs,
who work at left tackle, right tackle,
left guard, and right guard respec
tively, j;ro bolstered by quarterback
Meek and center Herwig in their
conviction.
Let it here he made clear that
consensus of opinion makes the
outcome of the 41st annual
Game a toss -11 p. Dopesters pre

of football from start to finish;
some go so far as to say that in rd?
those 41 years of Stanford-Cali
fornia competition the 1935 var

matched.
Messrs. Blower, Cornell, Fowl'.r,
and Archer are a group that Stan
ford may have trouble stopping. The
used it for their needed scores in
most every game. And they'll prob
ably fill the ether with porkhides
tomorrow.
Stanford might have some diffi
culty handling those Blower passes
but it's a cinch that Monk Moscrip
and Keith Topping will force him to
get them out of the way in pretty
quick time, perhaps so fast that he'll

have difficulty spotting his receiving
end.
If Bobby is having trouble with
the Cal defense, which some tell
us, is the strongest on the coast,
the Indians may take a turn at
throwing the ball around. And
there's a chance that Bobby Gray
son may come in on the receiving
end if plays Tiny worked out early
this week are called.
Boiled down, it's Stanford's
stronger backfield and superior ends
to overpower Cal. In the middle of
the line both squads appear to be of
almost identical power. However, in
little more than 24 hours specula

via the air. In addition to passing,
forward and lateral, that lets in
plain and fancy field goaling. A
Stanford advantage is seen in the
toe of one Mr. Monk Moscrip, who
has already added no less than 15
points to the Redskins' credit iliis
season. Monk also possesses fin
gers that have a knack for hauling
down passes.
However, it is generally rumored
on the Berkeley campus that left end
Henry Sparks is no mean booter
himself. And he's missed very few
passes this season. It is California's
Sparks, then, who seems most com
parable to Moscrip when it comes
to kicking and pass-snagging.
Perhaps (he all-important ques
tion that looms for tomorrow's en
counter is this: Can California stop
Bobby Grayson? Gentlemen who
should know have labeled Bobby
the greatest ball carrier in the busi
ness, but there are several tough in
dividuals from Berkeley who will
argue that point. Among them are
such strong-armed fellows as Lutz,
Nordstrom, Anderson, and Tenney
in the Bear line. These gridstevs,
who work at left tackle, right tackle,
left guard, and right guard respec
tively, j;ro bolstered by quarterback
Meek and center Herwig in their
conviction.
Let it here he made clear that
consensus of opinion makes the
outcome of the 41st annual
Game a toss -11 p. Dopesters pre
dict a display of an air-tight brand
of football from start to finish;
some go so far as to say that in rd?
those 41 years of Stanford-Cali
fornia competition the 1935 var
sity squads arc the most cvenh
matched.
Messrs. Blower, Cornell, Fowl'.r,
and Archer are a group that Stan
ford may have trouble stopping. The
used it for their needed scores in
most every game. And they'll prob
ably fill the ether with porkhides
tomorrow.
Stanford might have some diffi
culty handling those Blower passes
but it's a cinch that Monk Moscrip
and Keith Topping will force him to
get them out of the way in pretty
quick time, perhaps so fast that he'll

have difficulty spotting his receiving
end.
If Bobby is having trouble with
the Cal defense, which some tell
us, is the strongest on the coast,
the Indians may take a turn at
throwing the ball around. And
there's a chance that Bobby Gray
son may come in on the receiving
end if plays Tiny worked out early
this week are called.
Boiled down, it's Stanford's
stronger backfield and superior ends
to overpower Cal. In the middle of
the line both squads appear to be of
almost identical power. However, in
little more than 24 hours specula
tion will cease and realities begin.
And when that times comes may
, the underdog have his day!

Floyd Blower, Cal half, has passed
the Bears to three major wins, but
I has scored only once himself.
