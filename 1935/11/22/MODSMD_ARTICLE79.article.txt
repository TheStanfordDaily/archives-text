# Reveal Tiny Star Player; Never Alibis
## Card Coach Has Lost Four, Tied Two Games In Three Seasons 
### Art Stokes 
He's the man who won't alibi for
his team, because he sees no reason
why he should.
He's the man who is ready to fight
any "bleacher coach" who even hints
his players don't try every minute
they are on the field.
He is, in short, "Tiny" Thornhill,
chief of a tribe of Indians known
in football as the Big Red Machine.
"Tiny" has considerable justifi
cation for his stand. In the three
years he has been head of the
Stanford football department, the
Indians have lost only four games
and tied two, and even in defeat
they have rolled up tremendous
yardage totals.
Although virtually all his fame has
come in the months since 1933 when
ho slartcd work with Stanford's fa
mous sophomores, "Tiny" has long
been an important cog in the Farm's
football machine.
For 11 years he was an assistant to
"Pop" Warner and as far as most
newspapers and fans were concerned
he rated publicity only when his
chiirges in the fox-ward wall broke
and an opponent sailed through to a
SCOI'C.
Then in 1933, Warner went out
and "Tiny" was suddenly elevated
(o the head man's post. Through
all the activity,of the three sea
sons which have brought two
championships and hopes of an
other to the Indians, "Tiny" has
steadfastly maintained his teams
need no apologies, win, lose, or
draw.
"Tiny" came to Stanford in 1922
as co-coach with Andy Kerr, because
President Wilbur thought he was
"too young" to handle the coaching
alone. Two years later Warner came
along to direct the Indians. In the
years "Pop" ran the team, "Tiny"
was offered head coaching jobs at
Oregon and Washington, but ho
stuck with the Indians.
Before he came to Stanford, "Tiny"
laid the foundations of his football
house on Eastern turfs and teams.
He was line coach at Centre College
in Kentucky during the days when
the Praying Colonels rose to national
prominence through their almost
legendary feats.
At the time Charley Moran, Na
tional League baseball umpire,
was head coach at Centre, but he
still was touring the diamond cir
cuit during the early weeks of the
grid season. So "Tiny" was left to
guide the Colonels through the
preparatory weeks and early
games. Their brilliance in those
games and through the season in
dicated "Tiny" did a pretty good
job.
Thornhill's football days began in
high school. When he was 11 a siege
ol scarlet fever left him with paraly
sis of both legs. Doctors suggested
exercise. Thornhill, then known as
Claude, took them at their word. He
went out for baseball, basketball,
football, hockey, track, lacrosse, and
tennis.
At Beaver, Pa., high school, the
legs did so well he ran the 440 in
51 seconds and the 880 in 2:02, good
marks even now and better for
those days. His high school ath
letic career was topped, however,
by his work as fullback on the
grid team. Several colleges bad an
eye on him, but Iluhe Wagner,
captain of the Pittsburgh team,
lalkcd him into going there.
Claude's folks let him go to Pitt,
but said he shouldn't play football.
Two years later he was fullback of
the Pitt eleven coached by Joe Duff,
ex-Princeton all-American.
Then "Pop" Warner hooked up
with him for the first time—as Pitt's
coach and Thornhill shifted to tackle.
In 1916, on Warner's greatest team,
which is considered one of the great
est of all football history, Thornhill
war selected all-American tackle.
It was at Pittsburgh—and through
tlv Panthers—that the incongruous
"Tiny" was tacked onto Thornhill's
name. Pitt was playing Syracuse and
Thornhill planned to pull out of the
line on offense to block out the op
posing fullback. \
Officiating was a huge man oddly
known as "Tiny" Maxwell. Every
time Thornhill started after the
fullback. Maxwell seemed to be in
his way. Finally Thornhill in
formed Maxwell he'd either have
to keep out of the way or get
c pped.
A few minutes later, Pitt's tackle
pulled out of the line—and there was
Maxwell. Thornhill promptly clipped
him and several hundred pounds of
beef tottered and fell—with Thorn
hill on the bottom.
"Get off me, you elephant," bel
lowed the player.
"You're not so tiny yourself,"
retorted Maxwell. The Panthers
p : ckod up the remark and gnve
Thornhill his "Tiny" moniker.
The season after his nil-American
work ended, "Tiny" was Warner's
assistant at Pitt, but quit in mid
season to play pro football at Mas

silon, Ohio. Then he went to Cleve
land, where he played with Knute
Rockne. "Tiny" was player-manager
of the team and when Rockne went
to Detroit, developed his famous
"butterfly defense" against the
Rockne system.
The Rockne offense relied on the
end's ability to take out the defen
sive tackle alone, so "Tiny" played
a couple yards back, then rushed
in past the end to break up the ad
vance.
Following the Warner system,
"Tiny" has built the three-year
achievement recoid which he + hinks
can be climaxed Saturday by a win
over the Golden Bears great eleven.
