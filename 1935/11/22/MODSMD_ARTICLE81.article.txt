# Varsity, Frosh in Soccer 'Big Games'
## Bear Squads Are Favored Over Indians Visitors Ready To Repeat Victories Chalked Up In Past Tussles 
### 
Short-enders in the dope, but de
termined to avenge last week's de
feats, Stanford's varsity and frosh
soccer teams will tangle with Cali
fornia in their own "big games" on
the Farm tomorrow morning.
The yearling tussle v/ill start at Â£
o'clock on the frosh football field
with the varsity game set for one
hour later on the turf just off Em
barcadero Road.
Four of the Indian regulars' five
ex-cripples will probably be in the
opening line-up tomorrow, though
it is doubtful how long some of
them can play. Herb Sawyer,
light inside, has been out with a
sprained ankle which is now strong
enough to make him a probable
starter.
Chuck Parker, left wing, has re
covered from a case of the "flu," but
Bob Hall, center half, was in the
hospital yesterday with an ankle in
jured in the San Jose State garni
Wednesday. Hall is definitely out
of tomorrow's contest. George Hatch
one of the team's best defensive
players, has been shifted from right
to center half. Dick Hanna or Cari
Eitnier will start at Hatch's old po
sition.
Pete Knecht at left inside, Dave
Sloane at left half, Captain Barnej
Vierling at fullback, Ed Nightingals
at right wing, and Paul Helms
goalie, will probably all start agains
the Bears. The other fullback posi
tion is doubtful between Jim Mc-
Cormick and Wayne Richardsor
depending on the condition of th<
former, a first-stringer who has beei
injured. Karl Sehaupp will prob
ably start at center forward, as Mike
Gomez' ankle is still weak.
California's 5-0 victory at Ber
keley last Saturday was unde
served, since they outplayed the
Indians by only a slight margin.
Success or failure of the Stanford
season will be determined by
tomorrow's game, and Coach Dick
Bullis' eleven is set for its best
game of the year.
Stanford's probable starting line
up, subject to several last-minute
changes, is as follows:
Right wing, Nightingale; right in
side, Sawyer; center forward, Go
mez; left inside, Knecht; left wing,
Parker; halfbacks, Hatch, Sloane,
and Hanna or Eitnier; fullbacks,
Vierling and McCormick; goalie,
Helms.
With improved passing and de
fense, but weak shooting, Coach
Dick Forhan's frosh are also un
derdogs against the Bears. The
Cubs won, 3 to 0, in the Berkeley
tussle. One change in the line-up
finds Bill Barkan, former regular
who was out with influenza, back
at right wing, replacing Schultz,
Forhan has real hopes of a victory
tomorrow.
The probable starting frosh eleven
includes Porter, goal; Carnahan and
Harrington, fullbacks; Brownton,
Gustafson, and Rasmussen, half
backs; Mcintosh, left wing; Fi
danque, left inside; Lowe, center
forward; Chalmers, right inside; and
Barkan, right wing.
