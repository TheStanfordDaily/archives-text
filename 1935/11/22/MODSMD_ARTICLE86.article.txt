## "WE CAN'T"—STUB "WE CAN"—TINY 
### 
Two psychologies — two coaches:
different as day and night.
During this last hectic Big Game
week those two have been having a
lot of fun, despite a lot of private
worrying on the side. For, from
practice field to practice field, Tiny
and Stub conduct their own little
battle between football schools of
thought.
And if there ever were two op
posites, here they are. On the one
hand, genial Thornhill. No closed
practices for him, no tricky state
ments, no shams. Right from the
shoulder Tiny will tell you what
he actually thinks about Stanford's
chances tomorrow.
He'll tell you that he expects to
see an Indian ball club play its best
ball game of the year. That if they
do it'll be all Stanford.
And those who've followed the Red
closely this season will probably
agree with his words. For Tiny's line
on the situation hits the point ex
actly.
And at practice he throws open
the door to all comers. It makes
no difference if Floyd Blower,
Stub himself, or the whole Cal
team walks in. For Tiny believes
that you can't liml out much from
a practice session unless you're
higher than the (ield level and can
trace the plays as seen from above.
And since that's an impossibility
on the Card Held, there's no worry
there.
But he has still a further reason
ing. It is rather widely known that
secret practices are almost an im
possibility. The more undercover
they are, the more leaks through.
And if anything really important is
going on behind those locked gates,
it usually finds its way to rival coach
in short order.
So Tiny throws everything open,
invites all comers, instructs news
paper scribes when he wishes some
thing kept quiet, talks freely, and
speaks his mind. That's his psychol
ogy on the correct management of a
football team and its publicity just
before the greatest game of the sea
son.
