And in contrast —Stub Allison. No
less loved by his team and following,
Slub carries out a policy of "the un
derdog spot at any cost," semi-closed

All season lie's been using the
"fear somebody" slogan as a me
dium to put his team on the bot
tom. And so far it's worked well;
the Bears have climbed from the
bottom to last rung of tbe Coast
football ladder within a period of
two months. Stub's psychology has
most certainly had much t.) do
with it.
Most everyone realizes, however,
that he doesn't tell the team the same
things he tells the public. No, it's
not probable that he'd blurt out in
tiie dressing room, "You fellows
can't beat Stanford."
But that's his psychology—build
tip your position of inferiority
whether you fool anyone or not. And
then there is a chance that some
will actually swallow the pill.
At. practice he admits just whoever
he wishes. Sports scribes, friends,
can watch the Bears; rival coaches
and players can't. It's not an air
tight set-up but just designed to pro
tect the major secrets of a great
California football team.
Tomorrow Tiny and Stub sit op
posite one another, watch their re
spective hopes battle on the field, and
see their psychologies matched.
Stub with his "we can't win." Tiny
with "we ought to win. May they
