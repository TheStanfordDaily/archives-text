Old Hand Will Be Captain
Coach Thornhill last evening said •
he was making no exception in the ;
policy he has fallowed all season of j:
naming the field marshal in the few !
minutes preceding a game. But he i •
did say (hat one of the "old players" j'
deserved the privilege of captaincy :
; and would get the post.
! "Bob Grayson definitely will not :
he captain," Tiny announced. "He
is going to have all the responsi
bility he can handle calling sig
i nals." . j
Each one of the possible captains, !
| when interviewed yesterday, was \
| definitely optimistic concerning the j
outcome of the game.
"We Have Experience"
Said Wes Muller: "We've got the j
i ball game. Experience gives us a j
| big edge over Cal's team, which is i
I made up mostly of a bunch of soph- J
i omores. We're due to win. I'm sure
| of it."
Bones Hamilton also had definite '
ideas about a Stanford victory, j
I "We'll win because we're in good \
physical condition, and because I
our team knows how to work to- 1
gether. About eight of us have
played together for three yeasr 1
and we can depend on one an
other."
Bobby Grayson believes that
| Stanford has the edge in the back
field, and that the team as a whole
| is made up of a better type of men i
I than is Cal's eleven. He thinks the |
Big Game will be a repetition of j ,
' 1933 and '34.
