# Bear Sophs Likened To Card Men of '36

### 
Leonard B. "Stub" Allison, in his
first year as head coach of Califor
nia's Golden Bears is conceded a
better than even chance to take his !
undefeated squad tp Pasadena's Rose 1
Bowl on January 1. In this respect,
Allison is following in the footsteps !
of Stanford's Tiny Thornhill.
Tbe California set-up this year i
is almost identical to the gridiron
situation on the Farm in 1933,
when Thornhill took over a falter
ing team after Pop Warner had
left for the East.
Analogy No. Iâ€”Allison and Thorn
hill, instead of being imported from
some school where they had earned ;
a reputation, rose from the local
ranks and took over the whole re- j
sponsibility after having been as- |
sistant coaches at their respective j
universities.
Both found spirit and a willing
ness to co-operate abundant as the
football team and student body in i
each case proved concertedly behind
the new regime.
Tbe comparison goes further:
In Bill Ingram's last year at Cali
fornia, just as in Warner's last

I
season at Stanford, an exceptional
crop of freshmen was looking to- j
ward the time when they could
play varsity football. When the
new coaches took matters over,
these frosh had been graduated to
sophomores, and they moved into I
the varsity ranks.
At Stanford, sophomores Bobby !
Grayson, Frank Alustiza, Bones 1
Hamilton, Monk Moscrip, Claude
Callaway, and Bob Reynolds were
all first stringers in 1933. Compare
that to Jack Hay, Hank Sparks, Milt
Pollack, Vard Stockton, Angelo Re
ginato, Bob Herwig, John Meek,
Harry Thomas, Sam Chapman, Ken
Cotton, George Cornell, and Jack
I Howard, all sophomores at Berkeley
this season.
! Wally Back, star Oregon Univer- j
j sity halfback and former resident of 1
j Palo Alto, was the latest football
' fatality this season, falling victim to j
j blood poisoning following an opera- j
! tion on his right leg.
