# Grayson, Moscrip All-Coast Choices
## 
### 
There is an old maxim that goes: j
"It is never too early to start pick
ing all-American teams."
So the Daily herein submits a ten
tative all-Coast squad, the cream
of 1935's Pacific gridiron warriors.
The easiest jo!) to pick is that
of fullback. There can be no other
number in this combination at lull
but 22, no other name but Bobby
Grayson.
The hardest job to pick is center.
Almost every team on the Coast i.s
booming a man for all-Star recogni- %
tion at the pivot post.
Stanford has Wes Muller, ihe man J
who passes the ball for Monk Mos- J i
cxip to kick goals to win games, and
a good pass defense man. Cal has i
big rangy sophomore Bob Herwig, |
who is always where the ball is, and
who plays 60 minutes every game.
Berkeleyans call him a better man !
than Babe Horrell, of 10 years ago. ,
Ucla has Sherman Chavoor, their
"one-armed wonder," who cleverly :
foxed Stanford more than once, .
and who scored his team's two !
points against California. St.
Mary's has Wagner Jorgcnson,
idol of Moraga, and maker of a |
big hit with Eastern scribes in the
Fordham game. Troy has Gil
Kuhn, and Washington, Ed Eaza
levitch.
j It is not so hard to pick optstand- |
ing backfield men under Grayson. |
Good fullbacks are dwarfed in com- j
parison to Bobby, but the three best ;
look like Nello Falaschi of Santa
Clara, Noworgroski of Washington,
! and Propst of Southern California.
At quarter there are Bill Paulman j
of the Cards, known for his excellent ;
kicking, good passing, and quarter
back-sneaking; Davie Davis, light
but fast Trojan slicer and passer;
John Meek, Bear blocking and de-
I fensive star; and Harry Cain, Husky
I ball packer.
For halfbacks the leaders are By
ron Haines of Washington and Ed
Goddaxd of W.S.C., two spark-plug
ball carriers and passers. Don Fow
ler leads a bunch of equally good
; halves at Cal, including Blower, Ar
| cher, and Ken Cotton. Herb Shrei
ber has been the main St. Mary's
running threat all season. Chuck !
Cheshire of Ucla must not be omit- !
| ted from a list of this type.
At ends Stanford can furnish
j two, as good or better than any
other two on the Coast, or, as some
! say, in the country. They are Monk
1 Moscrip and Keith Topping. Both
let very few backs sweep around
their end at any time, and are
! adept at taking the tackle on of- |
fense and taking out interference
on defense. Moscrip's goal-kicking,
of course, puts him in line for
most of the all-American teams.
Other outstanding *flankmen are
Jack Brittingham of Cal, Captain
I McChesney of Ucla, Eddie Erdelatz
i of St. Mary's, Norm Finney of Santa
Clara, Bill* Gaisford of S.C., and
Captain Stan Rioi'dan of Oregon,
i i The tackle situation presents sev
j oral big fellows of all-star timber.
Horse Reynolds, last year an all-

American selection; Larry Lulz,
much-boomed for a spot at Cal;
Herm Meister, Gael strongman and
field-goal kicker; Max Belko of Troy;
Ruse Letlow of U.S.F.; Chuck Bond
of Washington.
Indians Dutch Rouble, Woody
Adams, and Bob Black are among
the Coast's best at guard.
