Although frosh football has kept j
its ranks a bit ragged, the Papoose
track squad is slowly but surely ;
getting under way in preparation j
lor the spring season.
To dale, the team has shown ;
strength in sprints, hurdles, dis- ;
cus, and broad jump; however, it
will take an all-around powerful
aggregation to push over the Bear
yearlings, who are already boast
ing one of their most powerful
teams.
As yet Coach Bill Ellington has
only a vague idea as to what men
will compose his 1936 frosh team.
A review of the present yearling i
prospects shows that two men,
Sieve Taggart and Rudolph Kelley,
are doing well over 22 feet in the
broad jump; Robert Wagner, Roy
Thompson, and Richard Carew look
good in the sprints, the latter two (
having done 9.9.

Heat of ordinary stars is placed at j
close to 2,000,000,000 degrees by
Harvard observatory scientists.
