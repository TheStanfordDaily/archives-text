# Paly Citizens Look For Indian Triumph
## 
### BOB EISENBACH 
From the fire department to the i
city bastile to the high school, Palo
Alto was apparently pulling together
for a resounding Stanford victory 1
tomorrow.
At least that's what a survey of
Paly's leading citizens and public
I servants revealed yesterday. Ar
nold liumwell, city attorney, has
a neat legal play all figured out in
case the football plays don't work.
But if they do, and he's sure they
will, he'll refer the whole case
to the Supreme Court meeting at
Pasadena.
"Stanford has a more than even
chance to win their suit with the
i Bears," Rumwell said. "So far
| they've been too consistently out of ;
j order to make a real showing. But
| with their good counsel, they're
bound to get the judgment, and
maybe even court costs."
Across town at the Palo Alto High
School, Principal George Stewart
' was ready to give the Indian grid- '

i ders a straight "A" card, just on
the strength of his own belief in
their footballing ability. "The Cards
have the advantage of a home field,
and that's a lot," he pointed out.
Meanwhile, 11. B. Ingalls, man
ager of Roos Brothers, declared:
"Just look at the quality of the
goods. There's real value in those
men. And with that hackfield j
thrown in for good measure and
long wear, you can't miss."
Down at the city firehouse we met i
Chief Bill Clemo, who makes quite
a study of the sports pages with his
men when not rolling out on what '
he called "hot dates." The smoke
: eaters favor the put-up-or-shut-up j
method of showing their favor, j
| "And don't think because we're |
willing to stake just a quarter apiece
in the Big Game kitty this year that 1
we don't think you've got a four- !
alarm team." The Chief and his 1
! crew are already in the department
Big Game sweepstakes, which nets
1 tht best guesser six bucks cash.

The major part of the funds need- j
ed to enlarge Cincinnati U's football
stadium will come from the coffers j
of the U.S. Treasury.
