STANFORD STADIUM, Nov. 23.
Things v/ere fairly quiet today north
of Seattle unci south of San Diego,
but between those two cities the
Pacific Coast was bedlam. Palo Alto
was the hub of a dizzily-spinning
wheel of public hysteria, cynosure
of eyes and ears, and happy hunting
ground for 25,000 automobiles, 1000
novelty hawkers, and 90,000 game
mad looters.
"Hack in '05—and "Yell, George,
thai was some night—wheel" were
familiar phases up and down the
Row and in Stanford's domiitics
this morning as the grizzled grads
renewed old acquaintances and
swapped yarns of the old days.
Some of 'em like the game, hut
the glamor of Big Game open
houses is the magnet that at
tracts most of these old alumni.
And young Stanford played the
part of a stooge for the hellers
of old.
Actually, the Big Game started
last night. Thousands filled the ho
tels, cheered and jeered the bands
of Stanford and California that
toured dancing floors and alumni
meetings. There was just as much
noise as if the Big Game had actually
Ix'en lost and won, but there was
an unmistakable tension not char
acteristic of the Big Night. No one
had a sorrow to drown or a victory
to celebrate. Nothing to do except
fortify himself the Big Bay
shore Push.
And once in Palo Alto, cars piled
up in grand fashion along ban
ner-decked University Avenue,
locked bumpers to a fare-thee
wcll, became viciously impatient,
and docile by turns. Those who
dared to look for a parking
space, and the chosen ones who
found a legal stretch of curb,
boomed into the main drag on
foot to he tackled by novelty ven
dors. flower salesmen, and even a
religious prophet. "Violets, viol-
Icts, have a bunch of violets . . .
Buy a paper, official score . . . Yu
gotta have a banner at the Big
Game . . . God help you."
We'd make an off-hand guess that
there are 25,000 corsages pinned on
25,000 separate new dresses in this
stadium. We're tempted to do some
statistics. Laying gardenias end to
end and that stuff. We do like to
wonder how many florists worked
how many hours so that all 'these
gals could sport a chest bouquet.
And how many dressmakers did
their stuff so all these miladies could
"ilress a 1929 Pig Game."
There's the old-time Big Game
cxcitemcnt here today. That sound
in the air is the voice of 90,000
people, held in hair-trigger con
trol bj the vagaries of a little pig
skin oval so tiny we can hardly
see it. And when that 90,000 lets
loose, you can just imagine some
queer bird on Mars cocking one
ear, and wondering what's hap
pening.
Bettors, ranging from petty to pro
fessional, were evident in every cor
ner of the campus and in all parts of
the stadium as "the cold dope"
mingled with biased sentimentality
in the granting of points and odds,
although these were narrowed down
to a minimum before the game ac
tually began. "Official" quotations:
open, 10 to 8 on California; high,
2 to 1 <m the Bears; low, 3 points on
Stanford; closed, "five bucks they
make the first down."
Late in the morning, spectators
began to trickle into the gigantic
stadium, by t o'clock it was wcll
spotted with early-comers, and
shortly after the first quarter be
gan all but a very few seats in the
less desirable behind-the-end
zonc sections were filled. It was
the nearest thing to a sellout since
the pre-dcprcssion era.
COLOR
Just before the game began, the
crewd stood in silence as the bands
of the two schools gathered in the
ci nter of the field to play "The Star
Spangled Banner." Soon after, the
Stanford rooters gave a rousing ova
tion to Frankie Alustiza, who was
watching the game from the stadium.
» The 90,000 customers arose as a
unit as the teams tensely lined up
lor the kick-off. while both root
in? sections gave a send-off cheer
that could be heard in down-town
Palo Alto. As the kick was be
in" returned, the stadium slowly
settled down to the first quarter
period of watchful waiting, while
the teams gingerly tested each
other's strength, after the fashion
of a pair of prize fighters.
California's team was dressed in
brilliant blue jerseys with gold nu
merals and brown trousers. The
Indians wore Cardinal jerseys with
v. bite numbers.
