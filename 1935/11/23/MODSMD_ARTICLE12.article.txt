Pacific Relations will hold its tenth

This institute met for the first
time in November, with GO
delegates from seven colleges in
the San Francisco Bay region at
Montezuma School near Los Gatos
and has been conducting annual
conferences since. The locale was
later moved to Lokoya Lodge in
Napa, and this year was brough

Stanford has been rife of the
principal school represented in the
institute, and this year a quota of
20 delegates was set for Stanford.
About 100 delegates from 10 schools
are expected this year.
Application blanks are available
in the A.S.S.U. office in the Old
Union. The total cost to each
delegate is $8, which includes
room, board, and registration fee.
A Thanksgiving dinner is the first
event on the conference program.
Personally interested in this in
stitute was the late Dr. David Starr
Jordan, who in 15)28 said, "The more
people who come together on an in
telligent international basis the bet
ter it will be, for the contacts they
make will do much to create a bet
ter understanding of each oher's
attitude toward world affairs."
