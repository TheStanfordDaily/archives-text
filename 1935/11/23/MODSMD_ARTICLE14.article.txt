## 
### 
Traffic regulations for this year's
Big Game parking have been al
tered by B.A.C. officials to cor
rect several mistakes made at past
games.
At the California-Stanford grid
battle two years ago, 80 motor
cycle officers were stationed about
the stadium directing traffic. It
was found by the B.A.C. that
there was not enough work lor
all, and the majority came to see
the game.
Tomorrow's game will have only
20 state ollicers, but there will
also be 450 student police officials
to aid in parking lots and at the
turnstile posts.
The stadium's parking space lias
enough room for 30,000 * automo
biles, and several campus roads
including the one from the B.A.C.
building to the stadium will be
blocked off as byways for pedes
trians and for the football players
from the locker room to the bowl.
