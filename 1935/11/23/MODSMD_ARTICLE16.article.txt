# Plans Made To Dedicate New Theater
## Cutler Slated To Speak At Short Ceremony 
### 
Preliminary plans for the corner- ;
stone-laying ceremony of the new
Memorial Hall are being prepared by
the University Public Exercises
Committee and the Theater Com- t
mittee. According to a tentative out- j
line of the program, Leland Cutler,
president of the Board of Trustees, i
will be asked to make one of the j
principal speeches of the day.
Over two weeks of steam shovel
excavation have resulted in a large !
gaping hole which more than one
student has mistaken for Thursday j
night's bonfire. But by the begin
ning of February, according to con- !
struction chief George Wagner,
steel framework will be in place and i
concrete foundations poured. The i
dedication will probably take place j
in the middle of February.
Members of the committee, Presi- !
dent Wally Brooke, Annalee Whit- j
more, A1 Hyman, Phil Brown, and I
Student Manager Bob Gros, pre- j
diet that the ceremony will be
brief, and no seating facilities can !
be provided. An amplifying system
will be installed to make talks au
dible if the University equipment
proves inadequate. Copies of The
Daily containing theater articles,
plans of the structure, and other doc
uments will be sealed inside the
marble block.
The whole building will measure
200 by 219 feet, and will be roughly
T-shaped. Facilities include a large
auditorium seating 155U persons, a
little theater, classrooms, and work
shops. Total cost of the structure
wil! reach approximately $583,000, to
be paid over a period of 20 years.
Public speaking classes, some of
which meet in Woodpecker Lodge,
will all move to up-to-date class
rooms next year. All dramatic
classes will also be held in the
Memorial Hall.
