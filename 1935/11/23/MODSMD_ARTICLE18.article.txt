# Track Remodeling Completed
## Modern Oval To Be Closed Until Spring Trackmen Continue Work On Stadium Field 
### 
Only vestiges of construction de
bris will remain after tomorrow on
Angell Field when the track is
Ix'dded down with its last layer of
cinders and clay.
Sam Mac Donald, foreman in
charge of the reconstruction pro
gram, will stop his workers before
the game tomorrow.
No Use Until Spring
The catch is, however, that Dink
Tcmpleton's track team can not run
on the new cinderpath until the
early spring months. Mac Donald.
Dink, and the B.A.C. planned the
track to be one of America's finest,
and they do not intend to have the
oval all torn up before it is bedded
down, packed, and baked by spring
suns.
Workouts in Stadium
So the tracksters will continue to
work out in the stadium, as they
have been doing since September,
and vyill keep on using the stadium
oval until the winter storms are
spent.
Headman Templeton chuckles as
he figures on how it's just about the
best unit of its kind that he has
ever lamped, and Mac Donald is
equally proud of his efforts.
Planned lor years, the new track
was started in July after a con
certed Daily-backed drive spring
quarter. Total cost is nearly $23,000.
Improvements Many
Improvements over the old Angell
Field are many. The hairpin turns
are eradicated. The track is cush
ioned, drained, and layered as well
as any in the country. Field event
runways are constructed as care
fully as the track. Pits are soft. The
whole infield is blanketed with
grass, and the various events are
placed more advantageously than of
old.
